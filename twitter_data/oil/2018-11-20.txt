2 2018-11-20 23:59:37 Just out of curiosity, what should be done. Because actions taken could send oil to spike and our economy along with the worlds econemy to tank and free fall. Everyone has answers but they don’t take those facts into Acct

12 2018-11-20 23:59:03 @YourMoneyAus today, all you ever wanted to know about the oil market when I assist @ the close 16:15 AEDT today.
13 2018-11-20 23:58:52 Wow. Unbelievable evil in this world like I can’t even comprehend. Just read a story about a Colorado man that strangled and buried his pregnant wife in a shallow grave, smothered his two daughters in crude oil tanks. All cuz he had an affair with a coworker n wanted a new life
14 2018-11-20 23:58:51 Is that a joke? Russia dont care about humanitarian aid to yemen and iran sure as hell dont. They would be pissed at an enforced cease fire. But there wouldnt even be a peep. Saudis war with US? lol that dont even merit response. We tell china and russia to buy saudi oil
15 2018-11-20 23:58:51 I remember when I was growing up, I always used to say, keep the oil. Well, I want to just-HURK just say one thing.
16 2018-11-20 23:58:48 Good discussion.The world is an integrated place. We produce oil that gets burned elsewhere & affects the environment. Many countries buy goods from China which makes their co2 emissions rise. Pollution doesn't stop at borders, geographical, political or economic. 
All in or else
17 2018-11-20 23:58:45 Still not sure why Kashoggi is worth more than all those Yemenite people? Because he has a name? Was a WaPo columnist? Sunni? US resident? Because US is by now no longer an oil importer? Fellow-media?
18 2018-11-20 23:58:42 And the motives don’t line up. America went to war w/iraq either over WMDs or for oil. No one even claims it was for the crimes of Saddam. 
But if u wanted the US to punish Saudi their genocide in Yemen would be an infinitely better reason then killing one journalist.
19 2018-11-20 23:58:41 Trudeau is doing business with Saudi Arabia as well. He just uses nicer words. He's a hypocrite! We buy Saudi oil in Canada and have a arms deal with them!!

40 2018-11-20 23:58:33 How can you say falling oil prices are NOT good for the economy? 
It means less money being spent on oil over seas.
That extra money is being spent at home.
You are #FakeNews
41 2018-11-20 23:58:29 The #LNP arecthe saviours of the day withall that tough talk on oil prices!!
The Saudi’s are so scared they dropped the price by closing the market with #oil

43 2018-11-20 23:58:23 It's what people knew anyway, #oil money greases the #American wheel ...
44 2018-11-20 23:58:21 The price of a gallon of gas goes up and oil companys make millions, the price of a gallon of milk goes up and farmers make nothing, not caring if the oil companies or investors get hurt.
45 2018-11-20 23:58:16 You just want Trump to become a Saudi enemy so they raise oil prices so you can blame the Republicans for higher gas prices!
46 2018-11-20 23:58:04 The state of New Mexico is bleeding methane gas from the oil and gas companies.  We are injured.  Those same oil and gas companies can convert to renewables and lead the country to 100% renewables.  This will create MORE jobs, not less.
47 2018-11-20 23:58:03 Have you tried them on toast with olive oil and mustard? I love them that way, though not all in the household appreciate the aroma!
48 2018-11-20 23:58:02 @realDonaldTrump #DISGUSTING!! WE EXPECT ABD DEMAND A NATION BASED ON RULE OF LAW!  THIS IS AN ABOMINATION, WE DEFEND EVERY AMERICAN LIFE NEVER PUT OIL PRICES ABOVE THAT
49 2018-11-20 23:57:48 Ditch the styrofoam, go hemp so we aren't chopping down more trees or using up oil for plastic.
50 2018-11-20 23:57:40 What's happening in the oil market? Find out on @abcnews at 11:15 AEDT when I talk with Scott Wales
51 2018-11-20 23:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
52 2018-11-20 23:57:36 Trump says the cost of oil would climb. If The United States isn't buying it the cost of a barrel of oil would drop.

Supply and Demand
53 2018-11-20 23:57:26 To you righteous ass politicians the average crumbs can't afford $100 a barrel oil. you're not the president.  mind your own business and do your job which you have not been doing very well anyways. so shut the hell up and quit criticizing. #JudgyBioch

55 2018-11-20 23:57:15 Eh, the oil thing not so much. The hype about them controlling us because of oil is way overblown.

However, defense contractors and hawks who hate Iran because they overthrew our puppet are very much the reason why Saudi Arabia matters at all.
56 2018-11-20 23:57:11 Trump not punishing Saudi Arabia in part bcuz 
 oil prices would go thru the roof-we export oil&could b independent of Saudi oil if we wanted 2 b?If anything,oil prices will go up due 2 Trump pulling out of Iran deal (expect any N.Korean deal will b worse than the one w/Iran?)
57 2018-11-20 23:57:11 I just wish Barron’s dad had enough respect for Khashoggi’s children that their father’s  life proved more important than Saudi oil and  weapons.
58 2018-11-20 23:56:48 I don't use cream, I use oil and am using coconut and almond oil

60 2018-11-20 23:56:41 "The enemy of my enemy" Mitt!  Keeping oil prices down is good for real Americans.
61 2018-11-20 23:56:37 It's too bad some of your products still use hydrogenated oil. Any chance of changing this? I no longer buy your products because of that.
62 2018-11-20 23:56:31 I love body oil!

65 2018-11-20 23:56:14 Also, I don't understand how we can sanction Russia for poisoning a spy (they deny doing it).. yet do nothing when a regime CUTS a man to pieces, literally. They can keep their oil as far as I'm concerned.

69 2018-11-20 23:55:34 I was getting my oil changed and the mechanic asked how many miles my car had. I told him I had no idea, but maybe 250k. I looked after I left and I only had 165k.  #HowLittleIKnowAboutCars #MineIncluded
70 2018-11-20 23:55:30 Yes, a year in which power output went down the shitter thanks to the oil crisis.
71 2018-11-20 23:55:20 Of course he does. The sad joke is that anyone voted for Trump and thought he wouldn't be all in on this. Saudi oil money is his favorite thing next to his daughter's legs.

73 2018-11-20 23:55:12 We can’t pretend our country is leader of “freedom” anymore when our President decides that the quest for oil is more important than the sanctity of a life. #KhashoggiMurder
74 2018-11-20 23:55:04 @realDonaldTrump YOUR A MORON I WOULD RATHER NOT BE  FRIENDS WITH SAUDI ARABIA THAN GIVE UP ONE LIFE THEY CAN TAKE THEIR OIL A D SHOVE IT AND SO CAN YOU.
75 2018-11-20 23:55:01 If you're replacing palm oil with more animal products it is very definitely a step in the wrong direction
76 2018-11-20 23:54:55 Shame on our government. They will need Alberta oil 2 fund socialist plan 4 CND. #Phukwitism CND had potential. Instead cycle of Socialist Liberals spending into debt through ridiculous entitlements & then #CPC digs us out only to be voted out for more socialist entitlements.
77 2018-11-20 23:54:55 I be so excited to come home just so my mom can put oil in my scalp and I don’t have to do it myself
78 2018-11-20 23:54:50 @realDonaldTrump So you think oil is more important than the people who reside or work in the United States? You showed you care nothing about the United States!
79 2018-11-20 23:54:50 #POTUS “I think your oil prices would go through the roof” 
#Me “I think the saudis jet fighter and weapons prices would be even higher”
For starters.

81 2018-11-20 23:54:23 Seeing the 3rd pointer made me want to ask you something. Do you think penis enlargement exercises are worthwhile compared to using black seed oil(1 teaspoon with honey everyday).
82 2018-11-20 23:54:18 I’d say it’s been going on longer than that
The energy policy is from Eisenhower - burns the Arabs oil, the learned that in WWII from the Germans losing access in Ploiești
Don't have a date when we lost control of the border 
But in the 50’s we had a “worker” visa for Calif

85 2018-11-20 23:54:14 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President please do not let the Saudi Arabia's BS you. It makes America look weak. Yes it is a cruel and evil world  especially in the middle east. But we don't need shit from them, with the amount of oil we have we could cripple them.
86 2018-11-20 23:54:09 He said it today. Oil is more valuable than blood.

90 2018-11-20 23:53:36 Thanks for the mustard oil warning. I think it sounds good, I haven't tried it yet. Want tht first time to be special. Now jist one more question: is it comparable to wasabi?

92 2018-11-20 23:53:31 Trucks bring FOOD and Heating Oil, so NO. I don't want tolls. Short sighted children running our state.
93 2018-11-20 23:53:30 I had strong reservations about the accusations calling Maria Mills controlled by corporate interests, but the fact that she failed to report income which may have come from Exxon Mobil and BP Oil throw a wrench in her claims to follow an anti-corporate, environmentalist agenda.
94 2018-11-20 23:53:28 My dear @realDonaldTrump ...SMH!  Oil prices were so much lower under President Barack Obama... You should ask him how he did it?
95 2018-11-20 23:53:25 The fact that Sair Khans luxury item is coconut oil makes me laugh so hard, even in the jungle you must contain that Asian frizz  #ImACeleb
96 2018-11-20 23:53:20 Our house solar install, to be installed this coming Monday, was to be paid in part by some oil money that’s been compounding for a very long time from grandparents.

The solar will power my Chevy Volt, which is a 90% electric car in my use.  #Divest #ElectricFuture

98 2018-11-20 23:53:17 Marco.  The masses care more about oil prices than human rights.  Sad but true.  Don't get sappy now, we need Saudi Arabia more now than ever.  Through history, the United States has assassinated heads of state when we deemed them enemies.  Never forget history Marco.
99 2018-11-20 23:53:02 minha mae comprou o bio oil por um preço ontem ai quando foi hoje encontro um com o dobro de ML por apenas 10 reais a mais do q o q ela pagou... putz JKKK
100 2018-11-20 23:52:57 America is a cheap lay. Buy her something when some oil drums, and she'll pledge undying loyalty to the people who did 9-11.
101 2018-11-20 23:52:36 Istill wonder Trump involved w/ Khasoogi murder, believe he knew, Nikki Haley retires right before this? Did she tell khashoogi he had to go to Turkey Consulate for papers in order to bring bride to USA? Then he gets murdered? All about $ -oil - biz w Russia, Saudi, Turkey, syria
102 2018-11-20 23:52:34 You said as quick as possible. That won't happen. Since oil isn't priced on a cost plus basis nothing will change price fluctuations either.

104 2018-11-20 23:52:18 We split it in half, brush with olive oil and grill it on the cut side. Amazing. Not now, tho.
105 2018-11-20 23:52:16 Oil prices very soon hitting $54 a barrel ?  Seems a gallon for 2:25 very soon coming
106 2018-11-20 23:52:15 me: hi my anxiety is Really Hard this time of year
my parents: we're gonna make you use the car that doesn't have a current registration, is 1k miles over for an oil change, there's a nail in one of the tires.
107 2018-11-20 23:52:14 I’ve been supplementing with CBD oil for about a month now. It could just be a placebo, but my mind has never felt more clear of anxiety & stress. Go get you some of that shit.
108 2018-11-20 23:52:14 I agree that the outcome was about the same no matter who’s POTUS. 

The statement was full of lies and a disgrace. 

The truth is it’s about oil and money. I’d be cool if he just said that.
109 2018-11-20 23:52:12 What? Most recent oil by rail export data was 200k bbl/d. That's 1/4 of KXL.
110 2018-11-20 23:52:05 No, just the underlying cause of war there was for oil and control of it. Of course they lied and we were right

115 2018-11-20 23:51:48 #Fuelwatch ...world oil prices falling ....country fuel prices stay high !
116 2018-11-20 23:51:34 Rather dismaying display of #Trump's naked nationalism, to the total disregard of wider global concerns. Looks like the #Saudis have got him by the balls and can more or less do as they like so long as oil and $$$ keeps flowing in his direction!
117 2018-11-20 23:51:26 Saudis been USA darlings since Wilson. They are a Zionist state like Israel. They sell all their oil at overpriced rates to USA. USA sells them top military hardware n training... Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, all bowed... nothing new!
118 2018-11-20 23:51:25 Did he say that oil is more important to the American people?
119 2018-11-20 23:51:24 so if any of us were cut up and murdered by the Saudis, it'd be fine because he gets good gas and oil prices?
120 2018-11-20 23:51:24 There's no evidence for those jobs. His numbers change with his blood sugar levels. Good relationship. They're the greatest source of ISIS recruits. They still find jihadist Madrassas. America is the cheapest lay on Earth. Bit of oil money, and you back the people who did 9-11.
121 2018-11-20 23:51:23 Stg I choked so hard off this oil pen I almost broke a rib smh
122 2018-11-20 23:51:16 Need a hot oil full body 
123 2018-11-20 23:51:13 Much of the same thing they see in Trump himself. They’re taken in by snake oil salesmen who’ve sold them on the perspective that only the Republicans can run this country—but the only place they’re running it is into the ground.

133 2018-11-20 23:50:35 Trump will not listen to the CIA... It’s all about oil & money  for the Trump Organization. Why do you people keep covering this thug. It’s thanksgiving let’s give it a break. The hell with him
134 2018-11-20 23:50:32 so sure lotus is partially responsible for low oil price. The cost is a look of a growing market for US producer and China does not import oil from USA anymore but from Iran.   That s why Iran is laughing at Trump  They now have China market
135 2018-11-20 23:50:22 So here’s the thing if you smoke regularly this may throw you into a Krabs meme. CBD oil is typically used to temper or reverse the high effect so be careful.
136 2018-11-20 23:50:17 The Fraser Institute is far more reliable than the Broadbent institute and your comments on Alberta oil and shale make it obvious you know zero about the Western Canada Sedimentary basin production. Maybe read up on the Duvernay play waiting to be developed.

139 2018-11-20 23:50:07 That would be in a cleaner world I guess. It's up to Consumers to make that choice. Some of us are. Oil definitely has its downfalls: look at Alberta. What are low income people to do? They can't afford electric vehicles so they're stuck with sometimes old, inefficient vehicles.
140 2018-11-20 23:50:04 I don't understand why Bezoz, Buffett, Gates and Bloomberg, Ellision and a few others cant just make a bid to buy out the Saudis. Then they could control the world's economy and have as much bloody oil as they want.

Oil on cardboard, felt-tip pen, watercolor on paper
142 2018-11-20 23:49:52 I WOULD DIE!!!!
143 2018-11-20 23:49:50 its like, 3 days in on the oil pen and honestly not bad so far for helping anxiety
144 2018-11-20 23:49:48 Sure. 

I cannot imagine a scenario when all four derailed pipelines get back on track, but sure.

We need at least two of these simply to replace oil-by-rail without significant net capacity increase. In other words, at least three if we wish net capacity increase and less rail.
145 2018-11-20 23:49:43 Participating in the corruption surrounding big oil is 'voluntary' too.  You doing to stop driving in protest?  People have to eat.
146 2018-11-20 23:49:22 Walked into Jiffy Lube for an oil change and it smells like weed.. 
147 2018-11-20 23:49:20 @PnPCBC We may have to do a shut down in Alberta oilfields.  No oil going to the Vancouver ,BC refinery no Warren Buffett oil filled rail cars going east to New Brunswick ,no oil revenue at all for the federal government who already lose millions a day because of Transmtn.
148 2018-11-20 23:49:19 Peppermint oil. I have some @_DomoWilson1
149 2018-11-20 23:49:15 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
150 2018-11-20 23:49:06 Few things make my anxiety spike like getting the oil changed in my car.
151 2018-11-20 23:49:03 My bf just came over and changed my oil I’m blesst
152 2018-11-20 23:49:02 UBS ON ONGC
Maintain Buy, Target Rs 240
ONGC stock took a beating due to soaring crude, will it reverse with crude fall
OVL's 1HFY19 consolidated profit up almost 9x YoY on higher crude oil price
Share buyback, stable crude oil prices should improve investors' sentiments
153 2018-11-20 23:49:00 Buhari with all his wisdom was with Abacha looting and pillaging our treasury for 5 years,
until Abacha died . Buhari was heading PTF, he was in charge of all funds from our oil. What happened to those funds? #NextLevel is a scam. Abeg say something else.
154 2018-11-20 23:48:55 And lots of OIL Stains!!!!!!
155 2018-11-20 23:48:44 Toast with butter and sugar
I usually go for frying stuff up since it's quick. If you have any leftovers at all you can usually throw them in with some oil and have at
156 2018-11-20 23:48:38 C'mon. This has been true of EVERY White House since oil was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula.

Saudi ALWAYS gets a pass.

No one can pretend to be surprised.
157 2018-11-20 23:48:34 No sheen.....it's all good sure.  What's the fuss all over? 

Nothing to see here, carry in Husky.  Bang up job.  Siobhan says all these preventative measures are being looked at in Advance 2030 where our lackluster think tanks decided to double down on oil production #nlpoli
158 2018-11-20 23:48:34 Ok so boom, first you get some HOT water put that in a bowl, put some tea tree oil in it as well, put a rag in it then place said rag (after slightly blowing cuz that shit hot) on ur face so it can open up your pores. Then immediately after go after the bump.
159 2018-11-20 23:48:32 USA loves bombing, killing & murdering people all over Earth in order to steal oil. Mainstream media might want to start telling the truth
160 2018-11-20 23:48:29 That’s a good point but I’d add economic conditions we’re far worse with the oil crash and weaker monthly LEI data. What’s baffling is LEI indicators are trending up each month this time. What do I know though -this week doesn’t make sense to me!
161 2018-11-20 23:48:26 good point … wish I considered that about 40 ticks ago today … rats … lol
162 2018-11-20 23:48:26 We knew all along that Trump  was cruising on Obama's economy. Now Ford is hurting, Apple sales are down, oil is falling, Dow is crashing, etc. 2019 is shaping up to be a bitch year. Maybe some of the maggots will wise up.
163 2018-11-20 23:48:25 how should we believe their fake tires on Iraqi , libyan and Syrian childrens ? Fake world . what is the role of the UN ? or the Security council ? its just a club for the oil companies and multinationals
164 2018-11-20 23:48:20 He is. The interests of the American oil barons anyway.
165 2018-11-20 23:47:57 Plus oil refined here in Alberta would be better for our economy, the stalled pipelines provides the push in that direction.
166 2018-11-20 23:47:49 Cannabis Oil is what you need Nicole. You’re far too young to be suffering with arthritis x
167 2018-11-20 23:47:44 The Oil aren’t actually scoring a lot of goals either.
168 2018-11-20 23:47:19 Trans Mountain is not an issue.  Victoria dumping raw sewage is an issue. Except you’re not getting money from the American oil industry to shut down the raw sewage. American oil just paying you to shut down our oil industry. Thanks Mike. Good job. Keep it up.
169 2018-11-20 23:47:18 As a result of the oil spill they’re sayin 14 oily birds ,four recovered and going to rehabilitation. Ffs. Right on lol
170 2018-11-20 23:47:17 $40,000 a day is nothing to an oil company...
171 2018-11-20 23:47:05 The choice between lives and oil is pretty clear.
172 2018-11-20 23:47:02 kalo gue di tetesin baby oil dulu, tar baru dibantu sama cotton bud
173 2018-11-20 23:47:00 I literally did tweet about him retching while digging whale oil out of a whale carcass in Heart of the Sea
174 2018-11-20 23:46:57 4.  Olive Oil 

Simply dip a clean mascara wand into the oil and apply onto your lashes before you sleep.
175 2018-11-20 23:46:54 รีล่าคือดีทุกเรื่องจริงๆ
176 2018-11-20 23:46:48 And by America First, you mean Corporate Oil profits
177 2018-11-20 23:46:37 Coconut oil/fish oil for real oils?
178 2018-11-20 23:46:33 I suppose we could sanction them and embargo them  We'd just have to pump more oil domestically and likely buy from Canada too  Good thing we have that pipeline from Canada
The Saudis would turn to Russia and China for military purchases and general trade
179 2018-11-20 23:46:32 @Chevron is the last Big Oil company continuing to fund anti-climate ALEC to peddle disinformation. Time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
180 2018-11-20 23:46:21 Does anyone remember America touting status as the biggest producer of oil?
I do.
Does anyone know America is the largest exporter of oil too?
Is America's oil resource the People's?
And is it an element of National Security?
Then why did congress lift the export ban for profit?
181 2018-11-20 23:46:16 Shale revolution has a HUGE factor in that (ironically motivated by the huge price of oil). Our oil was always super expense, and seeing global oil supplies balloon because of fracking and shale was going to have catastrophic impacts on our stores.
(Fraser institute is trash btw)
182 2018-11-20 23:46:16 Eu vi.. batendo no limite da linha inferior do LTA. Torcendo pra não perder o suporte.
O oil WTI furou o suporte em $55… preocupante. 
Acendi umas velas aqui, vamos torcer! rsrs
183 2018-11-20 23:46:12 がははは……‥…………
　らぶは、その辺に転がってますよ(^ー^)ｸﾞｰｸﾞｰ
184 2018-11-20 23:46:10 Do you drive an electric car? Just curious, as 74% of our oil is Saudi.
185 2018-11-20 23:46:08 they are not considered as humans by France UK Germany USA and the Whole world eveyday in Afghanistan ,Somalia Yemen ,Tchad ,Nigeria ,Mali , Sudan there is people ( childrens , womans , mens ) suffering from terror and famine but no one Care they are only their to take their oil
186 2018-11-20 23:46:07 If the idiot would stop pissing every other country off then he might have Canadian oil and EU help to take a stand. Of course he’d need to care first
187 2018-11-20 23:46:07 Onions lettuce tomato oil vinegar and spices
188 2018-11-20 23:46:04 So, they fly planes into the WTC towers, they undercut us every chance they get with regards to oil, and they kill human beings when ever they feel like it with zero repercussions.  If this doesn't get a congressional investigation, I'm done with the People in Politics.
189 2018-11-20 23:45:55 Bismillah So, Your Ulterior Motive Is Not Just 2 Arm S.A. 4 Untapped Oil In Yemen, But Also 2 Use Against Iran. #MuslimsvsMuslims
190 2018-11-20 23:45:50 B.C. does not produce oil and our economy is doing pretty well.
191 2018-11-20 23:45:48 I can’t believe I got blonde in my hair again and it doesn’t even look fried now  thank god oil treatments for a year round (no heat) actually works !!
192 2018-11-20 23:45:41 Like oil and gas industry they will use all their money and resources available to defeat popular initiatives that the majority are actually in favor of
193 2018-11-20 23:45:37 He definitely sleeps way better with his honey in his arms. Fivespice and incense, oil and Jasmine, matcha and something like ozone. Hanzo smells damn fine too. He's addicted to the smell of his hair, his skin, tea in the mornings, prayers at night... All of him.
194 2018-11-20 23:45:37 Saudis were involved with 9/11, no one cared. We aren't doing the apology tour  anymore. Let's not tank oil prices, Let's keep out of Muslim Brotherhood bullshit. I like @RandPaul and @LindseyGrahamSC, but be smarter. All these sanctions are ridiculous.
195 2018-11-20 23:45:35 Condemned oil for that matter my broda. These politicians just tweet to appear smart, but the populace knows better now.
196 2018-11-20 23:45:26 Hemp x Lavender Oil
197 2018-11-20 23:45:15 Peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, epsom salt and a dash of @doterra breathe oil in a bath...bihh I feel like a superhero
198 2018-11-20 23:45:14 Anyone wanting information hump oil 
Message me
199 2018-11-20 23:45:12 I need to get me some of that CBD oil my headaches have been coming back
200 2018-11-20 23:45:12 The foil way I use on the barbie with the skins on and a lil oil n salt. Sounds like what you’re saying
201 2018-11-20 23:45:08 Today I tube fed mineral oil to a 7 month old calf successfully by myself and I also fixed a vaginal prolapse on a 12m old pit bull by myself. Sharing bc I’m proud.  #vetmed
202 2018-11-20 23:45:02 You don't have to destroy us relations with Saudi Arabia to punish them.   Buy oil from Iran instead of Saudi Arabia for 1 month.   This works 2 fold.   Iran will get a taste of the good life and maybe they'll want more.
203 2018-11-20 23:44:46 I just used an entire rose jam bubbleroon from @lushcosmetics in my bath because I can and it was amazing. I have been reborn in argan oil and shae butter and nothing can defeat me now.
204 2018-11-20 23:44:46 @realdonaldjtrump what goes around comes around. You just said a torture, murder, and dismemberment of a journalist isn't worth risking oil prices. I pray with every fiber of my being that I'm alive to see karma kick your fat ass. You're a waste of flesh. An oxygen thief
205 2018-11-20 23:44:37 And he doesn’t care if the Saudi Crown Prince did or didn’t kill Kashoggi. As long as oil prices stay down. Monster.
206 2018-11-20 23:44:33 I have no idea what’s happening in Oil Country right now. TMac gone, Hitch arrives, Chia still there? Like, on paper, that roster isn’t great outside of 97 and a handful of others. But a new coach fixes everything? 
207 2018-11-20 23:44:27 When I got my ear pierced I used a solution they gave me and I used the tea tree oil when I got the bump on my ear
208 2018-11-20 23:44:17 They are. In the video, some workers sweep up dust used to absorb the oil, sending small clouds into the air -- that's what I was referring to with the masks being useful.
209 2018-11-20 23:43:49 Trump affirms oil prices to be more important than human life.
210 2018-11-20 23:43:43 Looks more like an oil painting then a photograph 
211 2018-11-20 23:43:38 Any bitch that shortens the word very as "v" has needed an oil change for 50k miles
212 2018-11-20 23:43:31 The Saudi Family is extremely important for them, i mean to those rich Families in the US who control the oil business in the World. If #Trump wants to be part of the Worldwide Elite he needs to protect the Mafia grid.

216 2018-11-20 23:43:14 ...and they were caught with their pants xxxx. Just kept investing in oil extraction without thinking about market access. Tens of billions in write downs coming soon.
217 2018-11-20 23:43:10 Btw mb mo bilang minyak kayu putih aja jd Eucalyptus Oil 
218 2018-11-20 23:43:04 how about the CRB index all year? Oil was late to the party yes? overseas stock markets sure look deflationary too. Not sure what will stampede the herd .
219 2018-11-20 23:42:57 @twt_kecantikann skincare routine for dry skin please?

4. toner
5. essence
6. serum
7. moisturiser
8. sheet mask
220 2018-11-20 23:42:56 Hypocrite Obama spiked KXL? Check your facts.Does it not bother you CDN energy sector workers are sufferring while we import hundreds of millions of barrels of Saudi Oil? Billions of $$$ lost to Canada that could go to healthcare,social programs etc? Is your name “bin Salman” ?
221 2018-11-20 23:42:51 Money for Oil. Some things never change. #PearlJam #ImpeachTrump
222 2018-11-20 23:42:50 The big picture is that our strongest ally is the Saudi regime.  We don't like the Iranians.  If we ruin our relationship with Saudi Arabia, Iran will gain and threaten full control of the Middle East including all the oil supply of region.
223 2018-11-20 23:42:37 Bersihin pakai baby oil / air hangat
224 2018-11-20 23:42:28 Ps anyone else had extremely vivid/lucid/ dreams/nightmares on omega fish oil pills, omg it’s crazy and I researched and apparently it’s a thing I thought I was going cray
225 2018-11-20 23:42:28 I haven’t tried the coconut oil!
226 2018-11-20 23:42:27 US looked other way for many years re KSA because of oil. In your time in Senate you have been part of this but you begin with Obama as it suits your relationship with Trump. 

This is 2018. We don't need KSA. We don't need Iran. Our foreign policy should focus on human rights.
227 2018-11-20 23:42:26 Ha ha ha.  I found that some funny too. With how rough those seas were last week, “no sign of oil sheen” really makes me feel confident.
228 2018-11-20 23:42:15 Many countries that don’t produce oil have really healthy vibrant economies. Many that do produce oil are economic basket cases: Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela, etc.
229 2018-11-20 23:42:13 Yup & he's worried about his own debt to SA investors & planned future contracts AND oil prices. As usual, it's all about him. So transparent, I just can't figure how he keeps getting away with it. The USA needs more safeguards & laws for politicians & Presidents who abuse power
230 2018-11-20 23:42:10 Jimmy Carter??  Our tolerance of them is all about oil and fear of the economic instability that they can wreak by manipulating the supply of it.
231 2018-11-20 23:42:02 i got my oil changed and they gave me a thanksgiving car freshener and i expected it to be like pumpkin BUT NO IT SMELLS LIKE MOLDY VEGETABLES
232 2018-11-20 23:41:53 But the price of oil! Plus, they are ‘very fine allies’ ... #TurkeyPardon was for #PrinceBoneSaw
233 2018-11-20 23:41:50 Have we considered that maybe the Three Wise Men were just trying to con Mary and Joseph into joining their essential oil MLM.
234 2018-11-20 23:41:48 I haven’t started my Christmas list, budget, or got my oil changed. On top of tryna cook Thursday Ian got nobody damn groceries 
235 2018-11-20 23:41:47 #KhashoggiMurder--Trump is a pathetic coward for not standing up to the Saudis over this. He is basically condoning the horrific murder of a journalist because of oil. Before you were president @realDonaldTrump our country had morals. No other president has ever taken us this low
236 2018-11-20 23:41:38 Trump is a hypocrite, as clearly seen in the email scandal and has zero integrity, as seen with Saudi Arabia. He is choosing “risking oil price increases” over an American life. Y’all supporters are pathetic.
237 2018-11-20 23:41:22 If you haven't tried pumpkin seed oil yet, I strongly recommend it! I got a serum meant for my face but I use it on my eczema too and it's been working better than my normal go tos. It's also good for acne and a little bit goes a long way 
238 2018-11-20 23:41:21 not from Thanksgiving, but I weaponized chili powder in hot oil by cutting myself and getting distracted so it was burning for 3 minutes instead of 30 seconds just as guests arrived and started coughing violently and crying
239 2018-11-20 23:41:01 u act like i just sit on my couch and chug olive oil and know what it tastes like
240 2018-11-20 23:40:57 1974 means it's probably suffering from Oil Crisis Syndrome. Look great though.
241 2018-11-20 23:40:55 Used to be bourbons but stopped buying then since 1. The flavour changed and it wasn’t nice. 2. I believe they contain that naughty palm oil substance.. if things change / improve.. I might buy them again 1 day.  @angelinab123
242 2018-11-20 23:40:51 You have to look at the reasoning given. According to this article judge said Congress didn't have authority under Commerce Clause because this activity wasn't commerce. I'd argue that it's services rendered for a fee.
243 2018-11-20 23:40:43 Obama’s economic policies weren’t good. He ultimately raised the rates of virtually every major federal tax, except corporate tax rates, already highest in the world, counting state corporate rates. With tight restrictions on coal and oil production
244 2018-11-20 23:40:40 I just looked past another bulletin board goon suggesting that Donald Trump has a short on Oil @JoshManMode @chigrl  @Lee_Saks
245 2018-11-20 23:40:33 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
246 2018-11-20 23:40:33 If my skin's too dry any cream I see around the house. If I no see any one anointing oil
247 2018-11-20 23:40:31 The oil companies such as BP, Shell, and Exxon Mobil are all sitting on free energy patents, of that I'm fairly sure. Lots of patents have simply disappeared in this area, and as I say, Tesla was onto something big, but J.P. Morgan pulled all his funding and sent him bankrupt.
248 2018-11-20 23:40:31 When she does make something that I can have it’s unnecessarily weird, like she’ll make spaghetti without sauce and put like a litre of oil into it, or she’ll make roasting potatoes by boiling them and ... obv with a litre of oil
249 2018-11-20 23:40:19 근데 원이 가르쳐 주면서 나도 열씨미 하니깐 스터디인 거겟지~?
250 2018-11-20 23:40:15 Such a big tough man rolling over for the saudis. And oil. If Obama has done the same thing the GOP would be screaming he was weak and kowtowing to foreign dictators.
251 2018-11-20 23:40:13 Girlaaaa @HeyFranHey never steered us wrong with a few drops of almond oil . It sounds like it should be wrong but my skin has neva been betta lol
252 2018-11-20 23:40:11 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
253 2018-11-20 23:40:10 Not sure it’s fully appreciated how consequential @USTreasury sanctions were today against Iran-Russia-Syria-Hezbollah-Hamas oil sanctions evasion scheme. Incredibly complicated scheme. Superior intelligence & enforcement. Treasury not messing around.
254 2018-11-20 23:40:07 How does @ChiefArnold still have a job? This moron thinks that people get high off CBD oil. 

News flash, there’s no THC in CBD oil and has been proven to be a medically beneficial extract.
255 2018-11-20 23:40:07 Venezuela sells oil to the USA in dollars. It buys gasoline in dollars. No one buys land, a house, even furniture except w U$. The Colombian Peso and Brazilian Real are strong in border regions and even grocers accept dollars. #Venezuela
256 2018-11-20 23:39:59 Does castor oil work to induce labor like fr fr?
257 2018-11-20 23:39:58 Really JIM? Of all the people she could have chosen, she picks one who thinks oil and gas is akin to land mines? At every turn the feds and prov send out signals to business that are toxic. This is just one of them. #ABPoli

Oil on composite collage
259 2018-11-20 23:39:54 The US has oceans of oil under quite a few states. Companies like CHK are playing games with leasing and drilling. Their CEO McClendon killed himself before being brought to justice after being caught. #DrillBabyDrill
260 2018-11-20 23:39:52 oil
261 2018-11-20 23:39:40 Oil is there due to global growth fears. If they turn true, India will not be spared. We are much more synchronised to global growth than in 2008
262 2018-11-20 23:39:39 It used to be digestive biscuits, but they taste awful since Sainsburys started supply only biscuits made with Palm oil as substitute for butter. How many Orangutans have been killed or made homeless this week in the name of Sainsburys & other supermarkets.
263 2018-11-20 23:39:38 Any by “eastern Canada” you mean the Irving oil corporation? It’s called “capitalism”.
264 2018-11-20 23:39:33 Wonder what the oil's record with Johny infamous as DJ is tho?
265 2018-11-20 23:39:33 Dude 1001 tweets still doesn’t make you right, it only exposes your failed attempts at reinforcing your biases and stupidity. Oil sector being 16% of GDP has nothing to do with crude oil being the major source of your forex/revenue and an import based economy slows without forex.
266 2018-11-20 23:39:28 $RMP shaping nicely & is about to commence drilling for a $1B potential target (400mmbbl oil) in Alaska... 2 milestones due this month & looking ready to kick
267 2018-11-20 23:39:16 @realDonaldTrump Hey, you know, it was only a little assassination of a US resident in an embassy. But we get oil! You are a sad, disappointing man. Shame on you, Donald Trump.
268 2018-11-20 23:38:59 North Dakota now produces more oil than VZ.
269 2018-11-20 23:38:56 I miss working at a dealership, tired of going to mechanic shops to get an oil change
270 2018-11-20 23:38:53 No sign of oil sheen? No, because the waves have spread the oil out over hundreds of miles by now. The rough seas took care of any sheen from it, but the oil is still out there. There's no way to clean that up now.
271 2018-11-20 23:38:52 @realDonaldTrump You CANNOT stand with the Evil  Prince Of Saudi Arabia and the United States at the same time. 

The murder is on Saudi Arabia and YOU. #murder #saudi #arabia #oil #trade #immoral #conspiracy
272 2018-11-20 23:38:52 So finally #Democracy kneeled down to Islamic #Monarchy.
#Oil #Business #Trade win over American legendary ethos.

273 2018-11-20 23:38:36 Not to mention he loves him some sweet Saudi oil money.
274 2018-11-20 23:38:35 Ya, she has a tap that only pours out Saudi oil. She also forces corporations to buy that oil because that’s how things work. 
275 2018-11-20 23:38:34 Chill-ass, getting lots of exercise and doing oil painting as a hobby George Bush.
276 2018-11-20 23:38:30 Nope, just Big Oil and the rest of corporate America. It's been like that for a while. Hope we don't start to forget that. The reason why we can't progress as a species is because we allow these entities to dictate what the best course for humanity is.
277 2018-11-20 23:38:27 Maybe we should stop giving corporate welfare!! Like giving 12 billion to the farmers because of Trumps tariffs or the the pharmaceutical companies get subsidies along with the oil industry
278 2018-11-20 23:38:15 @realDonaldTrump you are a pathetic disgrace! Anyone who sells their soul for arms deals and oil prices is a true traitor to what America stands for. Your whole administration is the worst disgrace this country has suffered.
279 2018-11-20 23:38:02 Looking back, it seems it's really just oil and resources that our country goes to war over.
280 2018-11-20 23:37:56 The dirtbag might be pleading Oil Prices, but it's much more than that. MBS isn't Saudi Arabia, and international pressure could dethrone the crown prince in favor of someone else. (There are hundreds to choose from.) 

MBS has something on the Trump syndicate. Dirt.
281 2018-11-20 23:37:56 #1: Trump is to free speech/press what Saudi Arabia is to murdering critics. Nope. Not right. Sorry! Draft #2: Trump is to caring what Saudi Arabia is to self-indulgent thugs with oil. Not that either; apologies. Draft #3: Trump is to KIND what Saudi Arabia is to JUSTICE. Closer.

283 2018-11-20 23:37:42 Total snake oil. I'll stick with my carbolic smoke balls GOOD DAY SIR.
284 2018-11-20 23:37:40 You can't get down the road less travel without getting a flat or two. Stay the course, keep the oil changed, and always trust those instincts. Picking up "hitchhikers" will take you off track. 
285 2018-11-20 23:37:20 Hibiscus face cream and may facial oil din
286 2018-11-20 23:37:20 Naw.  Hitch WILL make the team better. Maybe only for 6 months.  But that's all Oil want now. Chance to turn it around now.  Hitch isn't about building for 2, 3 yrs.
287 2018-11-20 23:37:10 Me: Yo be careful bleaching your hair too much fam. Maybe get some kerati-
Dumb guy: Nah its okay i put coconut oil on it for 1902 years
288 2018-11-20 23:37:07 Oil price and a middle east military air base is.
289 2018-11-20 23:37:03 That was a wish list. All they have committed to is $12.5 billion. Oil prices are too low for them to commit to more.
290 2018-11-20 23:37:03 Trump is not beguiled by MBS. He guides his actions based upon his understanding of American economic & security interests, primarily a stable price of oil.

The Saudi regime has been brutal for decades & every US president has dealt with them. Trump does so without pretense.
291 2018-11-20 23:37:02 tou oil pee lo tablet k sath magar le tou lo 
292 2018-11-20 23:37:01 If you don’t like what’s going on with Saudia Arabian princes killing journalists, well, I’m not afraid to say it; time to boycott oil.
293 2018-11-20 23:36:51 olive oil is gross
294 2018-11-20 23:36:46 People are dying every day! In the ME they’ve been dying by the thousands since 1980’s! Do you think this one person is better than the rest of them? They will keep dying in ME as long as there Oil, there is Israeli Occupation and Rotten Regimes ! Nothing new here! Move on!
295 2018-11-20 23:36:41 And the cheap oil sales. They got us by the balls just like we have them. Its a complicated relationship that I wish we were not involved in.
296 2018-11-20 23:36:40 Miami Dolphins officially announce QB Ryan Tannehill as the starter vs. Indianapolis Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium on Sunday.
297 2018-11-20 23:36:38 And energy use for transport was doing very well, containing the growth of oil consumption. CAFE standards are awesome.

299 2018-11-20 23:36:24 The thought of a sitting president saying that money and oil is more important then a human life makes me think I’m living in an alternative universe. Then you have the GOP totally silent about this. What is it going to take before we reach the point of no return?
300 2018-11-20 23:36:23 I can already name about $10 billion in investment announced this year. 
The iImperial oil announcement from just last week. Another refinery announcement too.

304 2018-11-20 23:36:07 Oil lamp? Candles please!
305 2018-11-20 23:36:00 Don't let #oil companies weasel their way out of federal review for offshore drilling, either. They have been since Day 1. Now we have the largest oil spill in #NL so far. @CNLOPB @CNSOPB #Whiterose #oilspill #cdnpoli #nlpoli #nspoli

307 2018-11-20 23:35:53 Who wants to change my car oil, wash AND detail my car? 
308 2018-11-20 23:35:51 No there’s none of the “illegal high” in the oil. I’m not into drugs either but this stuff is amazing. Just google it and you’ll see it’s perfectly safe and legal to the point you can get it on prescription now
309 2018-11-20 23:35:50 Social justice as an idea isn't just flawed. It is pure snake oil embraced only by the gullible and uneducated.
310 2018-11-20 23:35:48 spinach is a perfect vegetable and kale is amazing if you massage it with lemon juice and olive oil ugh
311 2018-11-20 23:35:46 we had to eat cream crackers and biscuits (don't ask) at uni today for an experiment and the lecturer was reading out the ingredients in case anyone was allergic and he read palm oil followed by a SORRY!! i love him
312 2018-11-20 23:35:46 If you have one of those dishtowels with inspirational sayings on it, I will check my oil with that thing.
313 2018-11-20 23:35:45 When oil is more valuable than morals.  

This is, quintessentially, Trump’s America. And no one should be surprised.
314 2018-11-20 23:35:40 Let’s get the complete list - your country can Kill Americans it
1) sells us oil
2) buys an apt from @realDonaldTrump 
3)loans @JaredKusher $
4) grants @IvankaTrump patents
315 2018-11-20 23:35:38 Solheim is not only a crook, but a scientific illiterate peddling environmental snake oil like the rest of the U.N.
316 2018-11-20 23:35:38 Pass the olive oil
317 2018-11-20 23:35:28 2)
...and then there's extra. More jobs than ppl needing them, including for minorities like the black community Dems love so much..right!
-Energy Dependent..We are now the Worlds largest producer of gas & oil. We no longer have reliance on foreign ctrys for their products....
318 2018-11-20 23:35:21 burgers dripping oil and full of bacon is gross
319 2018-11-20 23:35:19 Dear President Trump, we do not need Saudi Murderer Oil. We have our own oil. Cut Saudi Arabia off from US Aid, Business, etc.
320 2018-11-20 23:34:54 It's all about the $ period but it's blood money and oil ... Human rights for sale.
321 2018-11-20 23:34:45 High Anxiety...Will be ready with my CBD oil.
322 2018-11-20 23:34:42 The only reason it worked is Obama was able to get European buy in. We don't have any sticks economic with Iran we haven't been able to really do business with them since the Shah fell. That's why no one actually cares America tore it up. Europe gets the oil and commerce
323 2018-11-20 23:34:38 hMm aku kurang paham nih gimana jelasinnya, kalo first cleanser baiknya pake oil based. mw itu masuknya lebih cocok utk precleansing. (kayanya ada penjelasannya jg di skincare101 atau yutub danangwisnu). oilbased lebih enak jg kan bisa buat masaj sekalian bersihin komedo hehe
324 2018-11-20 23:34:35 Well if Trudeau would allow our oil and gas industry to work, we wouldn't need Saudi oil, which  Canada imports, in the Eastern Canada.
325 2018-11-20 23:34:34 Obviously killing Khashoggi was merely one way among the others that those OPEC&other oil produce countries used to push the oil price up!Besides the oil price would be up&up&up,conducting sanctions on Saudi Arabia would only encourage more&more similar evil things to happen.
326 2018-11-20 23:34:31 I met Tyler in 2009 at the Knoxville Late Model Nationals.  Back when he had long hair and hung out with Scott Bloomquist.  He was a nice kid. He is lucky to have had the backing he has had. To be as young as he was and to be on The Lucas Oil Tour, is amazing.
327 2018-11-20 23:34:28 Pani kay sath bhi hoga vaseline ya oil kay sath nahi hoga

331 2018-11-20 23:34:05 The Saudi episode was a setup
Trump rightfully stands with Saudi.if not Oil prices would go up & Russia would benefit & so would iran.CIA has it's own agenda and trump didn't feel its  evidence implicating MBS was desisive.khassogi was MB .Trump saw thru this and put the US first
332 2018-11-20 23:34:00 With oil prices sooo low, we legalized marijuana, for medical reasons of course! Brings in millions in tax revenues, simple really. Don’t smoke the weed myself, I prefer a fine Cuban , and U?
333 2018-11-20 23:33:59 but oil change & gym first 
334 2018-11-20 23:33:59 I’m sure @seanhannity & @TuckerCarlson will spin this into @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama’s fault for @realDonaldTrump’s base. I can’t wait, Best horror show of all time. US resident murdered but thank god oil prices are low. #the christianparty
335 2018-11-20 23:33:40 Fazel slamming Oil
336 2018-11-20 23:33:37 Try to post something intelligent for a change.

Yes the price of crude oil has gone  down in international market.

Now ask  has the govt. passed the savings to the consumers  or is pocketing  the difference?

The answer is govt. pocketing the difference. No relief to consumer.
337 2018-11-20 23:33:36 sex. cold water. peppermint oil. lavender oil. rosemary oil. chamomile oil. eucalyptus oil. foods high in magnesium. b-12. ice packs.

339 2018-11-20 23:33:31 y’all talk about the spiritual blessings of serving a mission but lemme just tell ya that I met a mechanic in Chile who moved here and now he’s changing my oil in my work parking lot cos I haven’t had time to get it done
340 2018-11-20 23:33:31 11/30 exotic trayce vid. Go polish the time machines and make sure them hoes had an oil change recently
341 2018-11-20 23:33:23 Many vegan products contain palm oil so they aren’t completely cruelty free either. But being vegan is still helping save other animals.
342 2018-11-20 23:33:22 I’m pretty granola but all natural peanut butter SUCKS. Give me whatever preservatives or chemicals keep that shit together. I do not want an inch of oil on top of a concrete peanut glob (that does NOT mix together no matter anyone says)
343 2018-11-20 23:33:21 In other words "I don't care if they kill 10 residents of America, provided the sell us their oil".
344 2018-11-20 23:33:14 Oil in your back yard and no way to refine it 
345 2018-11-20 23:33:13 ec council is just like isc2 where they just want your money and will say anything and do anything to get it, without any follow through. its all just snake oil.
346 2018-11-20 23:32:51 Currently using CBD gummies 25 mg each bear. They help me sleep.  So far my anxiety has gone down a little, but I'm waiting on a full-spectrum oil to come in to see if it makes a difference. 
347 2018-11-20 23:32:45 All the legit things you could be asking about and you waste time on this petty grandstanding? Come out of the echo chamber and you'll be surprised how this makes you look.
348 2018-11-20 23:32:43 A war monger deals or trades in war. Openly saying we should intervene in exchange for taking oil is war mongering, whether or not it actually happens
349 2018-11-20 23:32:41 It isn't much of a challenge to start hacking away at them-the blob has been doing this kind of thing since Standard Oil - signed: 'groveling goblin'
350 2018-11-20 23:32:39 What's a good price for peanut oil?
351 2018-11-20 23:32:28 Pompeo is so hot for all that oil he can't even talk a straight lie #AmericanThirst #tytlive
352 2018-11-20 23:32:23 Why does this have to be a competition between vegans and non vegans? If you don’t eat animal products that’s great. If you eat animal products but try to eliminate palm oil or products tested on animals that’s still better than doing nothing. It still has a positive impact
353 2018-11-20 23:32:20 motor oil
354 2018-11-20 23:32:15 Yes but it’s wise now to not act just for the sake of it. You want war or oil prices to skyrocket just because Saudi Arabia is doing Saudi things as always? #americafirst
355 2018-11-20 23:32:13 Let’s be real — no president, dem or repub, probably has the guts to cut ties with Saudi Arabia, and more importantly, the oil they provide.  We’re addicted, and they know it.
356 2018-11-20 23:32:07 Public service announcement- Heating fries in 375 degree oil prevents E Coli.
357 2018-11-20 23:32:06 Now America is being  reduced to the class  who have to kneel to money and oil, while shattering own FUNDAMENTAL VALUE! AMERICA IS CORRODING ITS GREATNESS.
358 2018-11-20 23:31:40 Americans do not want their aid ,  free grants and loans going to world leaders who are a menace to the world . They don't want their kids dying for oil in places not fit to even visit on a vacation .
359 2018-11-20 23:31:40 Sacrificed for cheap oil!
360 2018-11-20 23:31:38 楽しみだけど、とても不安だよ
361 2018-11-20 23:31:37 Renewable energy and shift from oil would solve all of this. But he doesn’t want to.
362 2018-11-20 23:31:27 40k a day is probably a drop of oil in the ocean to them
363 2018-11-20 23:31:08 Why are we backing the Saudi's? Their military is a joke. They couldn't defend Kuwait, can't defeat the starving Yemenis. Nevermind all of the trouble they caused for U.S. from Oil Embargoes to supporting jihadi terrorists. The Iranians would kick their ass in a 1-on-1 conflict.
364 2018-11-20 23:31:06 You ever have a long ass day go to your boo house, he pull you close and start rubbing your feet with coconut oil? Yea me either
365 2018-11-20 23:30:57 Gotta have it fresh out of the oil
366 2018-11-20 23:30:55 In Season 2 Episode 2 of @NatGeoChannel #MARS I discuss #BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest offshore oil spill in history, as warning for what could go wrong w/mining on MARS & for when profit is allowed to imbue technology with false promises well beyond true capacity.
367 2018-11-20 23:30:55 July to August crude oil production in WY increased by 7 percent and nearly TWENTY percent since last August (38,000 barrel increase).  #oil #crudeoil #wyoming #EIA

370 2018-11-20 23:30:44 ONE of the Worst Offshore Oil Spills in US History 
371 2018-11-20 23:30:38 Let's get real for just a second, k?

The relationship between the US and Saudi is key to the world's economy.

The US dollar is the world's currency in no small part because Saudi and it's minions price their oil in US$.

This allows the US to run it's massive deficits.

373 2018-11-20 23:30:24 Serious question...what should we do as a country about this? Do we sanction them?? Do we cease doing all business with them?? Do we stop buying oil from them?? Assad in Syria was using chemical weapons on children..what did Obama and McCain do about that??
374 2018-11-20 23:30:21 @E_N_O artistic daring, how about this: #Brexit the Opera starring the tory party with Cameron, May, The DUP and @Nigel_Farage as the Snake Oil Salesman...could be huge and not very expensive either, songs write themselves, put my cheque in the post
375 2018-11-20 23:30:19 Saudi Arabia is a horrible country we all know that. But they control most of the oil reserves in the world. Unless we take the oil from them we are in NO position to be their enemy. Not if we want cheap oil prices.
376 2018-11-20 23:30:18 Seriously get on the cbd oil
377 2018-11-20 23:30:12 I've never known a politician who had the vaguest knowledge of energy. Remember then-candidate Newt Gingrich in 2012? 

"The United States would simply provide an additional 4 million barrels of oil per day to Europe to cover the Iranian shortfall."

No problem, Newt!
378 2018-11-20 23:30:07 Saudi Arabia basically "owns" the "world" because they basically "own" the United States. #Oil
379 2018-11-20 23:30:00 This is a country that forced young girls to burn to death instead of letting them out of a burning school building because they weren’t wearing hijab.  Nothing is going to change the way KSA is viewed by the world as long as oil.
380 2018-11-20 23:29:56 Do we know the depth of the spill, or it’s likely vertical structure? The simulated trajectories in that document predominantly go to the southern Flemish Pass area. A region that contains substantial sponge grounds. If the oil plume is at depth, we should all be really worried.
381 2018-11-20 23:29:54 Has anyone ever used peppermint or lavender oil for home remedies?
382 2018-11-20 23:29:48 He isn’t even right...oil prices are in the toilet...he is such a dumb shit...he is going to be gone by Thanksgiving 2019...he is literally a criminal
383 2018-11-20 23:29:47 7. Spray an essential oil mist like lavender which is known to help release your thoughts and drift you into a deep sleep
384 2018-11-20 23:29:46 Wait till SAUDIs make the announcement that they will stop pumping OIL, because the high horse Democrats. Think your constituents will go for gas over $10 a gallon. Ted Kennedy was to big to charge, guess the Prince is too!
385 2018-11-20 23:29:35 どうやって告白しよう？
386 2018-11-20 23:29:13 America's version of human rights ends when there is oil involved, the hypocrisy
387 2018-11-20 23:29:09 So our president is an accomplice to murder in Saudi Arabia. And he wants to talk about oil. Are we even human?
388 2018-11-20 23:29:04 Soooon as I wake up tomorrow I’m getting an oil change
389 2018-11-20 23:28:47 Just wait 30/40 years when the oil runs out... then you can do something
390 2018-11-20 23:28:44 oil just popped onto my forehead sorry but i’m quitting this cooking shit
391 2018-11-20 23:28:42 Real news hemp was required growing for forefathers of this country and makes oil biodegradable and plastics would be environmentally friendly and fuel source we have been screwed all this time by FAKE NEWS

394 2018-11-20 23:28:10 Too late. Stock Market tanked today and Oil is down 7% as a result.
395 2018-11-20 23:28:00 With the present eastern based Liberals, oil sector is done. Saving tax payer money to bail out GM, Bombardier etc and ensure Quebec based industries thrive.
396 2018-11-20 23:27:58 Trump's redline.
You better have lots of oil when murdering critics. 
He's given them the green light.
The United States of Paper Tigers.
397 2018-11-20 23:27:42 Exactly.  We have coal and natural gas etc for a century or so.  Plus new energy forms will be discovered way before.  Battery cars and trucks coming right along.  The oil is in Eastern Province which is Shia.  China trading oil in yuan exchange, etc....
398 2018-11-20 23:27:35 Me I’ve been putting oil on my ears...
399 2018-11-20 23:27:32 #JamalKhashoggi I would pay A LOT more for oil before I would accept the brutal murder and dismembering of a journalist. PERIOD.
400 2018-11-20 23:27:23 Sneezing after vaping shatter out of an oil pen = a whole new can of worms
401 2018-11-20 23:26:59 Shaved raw Brussels sprouts, massaged, with a light dressing - like Olive oil, lots of fresh Parmesan, salt and pepper.
402 2018-11-20 23:26:55 This man. You have oil in your head
403 2018-11-20 23:26:40 Oil prices have nothing to do with trump's statement that "I asked them to keep prices down."
404 2018-11-20 23:26:39 Oil is dropping fast. Our fearless asshat leader could have confronted the Saudis about Khashoggi and it wouldn't have affected oil prices at all..but then the billions in that Saudi credit line would be greatly diminished for Jared and the rest of his family biz
405 2018-11-20 23:26:37 Oil markets have a very important role in our economy.

408 2018-11-20 23:26:30 Out here getting my oil changed
409 2018-11-20 23:26:26 This could be the first true test of @Bitcoin as alternative investment with the @DowJones continuing to plunge.  In the short term, it is not performing as such with bitcoin falling along with stocks.  @GoldMarket and @Oil_Trader are down too so this is not like 2008, so far.

411 2018-11-20 23:26:20 I need an oil change on my car already and I felt like I just brought it! But I did drive to philly.

413 2018-11-20 23:26:07 But its all good since they have oil @realDonaldTrump
414 2018-11-20 23:26:02 Arms sales and cheap oil before justice. #Trump continues to do and say the unthinkable and ignore  the evidence to suit himself.
415 2018-11-20 23:25:58 This guy is incredible. No longer do we have to decipher political double speak to understand what politicians really mean. 'it's about oil and money'. Easy peasy. Shallow Hal has spoken. Send him over to decode Brexit next!
416 2018-11-20 23:25:47 Lightbulb?  What's a lightbulb?  What's wrong with a good old-fashioned oil lamp?  This is the ERG we're talking about.

Germany on the other hand canceled their business with Saudi Arabia over the murder.
418 2018-11-20 23:25:39 Yes I did my friend. Tucson is registered as a solar city, and I'm proud of my home town. We can kill our dependency on oil with it!

421 2018-11-20 23:25:30 Just as oil was first discovered in Nigeria for instance; the interest, shift, or pressure it created is the same as data because it's actually the basis for all development.

424 2018-11-20 23:25:14 The world needs to stop trading in oil in dollars. Use monopoly money if necessary but stop using US Dollars.
425 2018-11-20 23:25:13 I agree, but can Iran survive 2/6 more years of sanctions? Iran, Turkey, and Russia need that oil from Israel.

427 2018-11-20 23:24:54 @Walmart in Lebanon,TN TLE is a complete dumpster fire . Took truck for oil change at 4pm CT. Was told 45 minute wait. After waiting 75 minutes, checked status and they didn’t even know where truck was in queue and thought I needed tire install.

429 2018-11-20 23:24:26 A plot by the country who created 9/11 to murder, dismember and 'disappear' the remains of a journalist is no match for the love of oil and power and money. We knew that Trump would do this. The silent @GOP stands naked in their complicity. You are not patriots. #shame

432 2018-11-20 23:24:05 It's a LOT deeper than oil.

In fact it doesn't have anything to do America's economic ties to Saudi Arabia.

It has everything to with @realDonaldTrump and his family's economic ties to Saudi Arabia and U.A.E.

And also, their complicity in the crime.
433 2018-11-20 23:23:53 this @potus makes me want to puke...blood money for oil...
434 2018-11-20 23:23:53 Canada is literally gone crazy!The oil industry is failing and the postal strike is no way closer to being over!We need a change in Government!!
435 2018-11-20 23:23:49 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
436 2018-11-20 23:23:48 I suppose we could sanction them and embargo them  We'd just have to pump more oil domestically and likely buy from Canada too  Good thing we have that pipeline from Canada
The Saudis would turn to Russia and China for military purchases and general trade

438 2018-11-20 23:23:40 You try to take a day off twitter, then the President tries to prosecute his political opponents and suggests it’s okay for an autocrat to murder a journalist if it might keep the price of oil down. What an embarrassing stain on America and everything we stand for.
439 2018-11-20 23:23:39 Thomas, you need to oil your brain. It’s getting cobwebby.

447 2018-11-20 23:23:26 i tried doing a oil change and I just spilled $30 worth of oil 
448 2018-11-20 23:23:19 Trump's a lie. He isn't controlling oil prices or gas prices. With all his cheap rhetoric he fails to tell you the why! Trump's been issuing waivers to countries buying from Iran negating sanctions. It has thrown oil into the longest decline in price of crude in 34 years.
449 2018-11-20 23:23:19 So Trump gives a green light to murderous regimes to continue their evil crimes against humanity.  The price in blood that we pay for oil is unacceptable.  Go GREEN, boycott Saudi products.  So sad!

453 2018-11-20 23:23:05 If oil prices are in great shape why is gas still expensive. Trump probably is referring to his friends who own 90k shares of ExxonMobil. This asshole placed a human life beneath the money that maybe lost if he doesn't kiss Saudi Arabia's ass. The only thing he cares abt is money
454 2018-11-20 23:23:00 Coconut oil and mischief 
455 2018-11-20 23:22:55 Bottom line, we need to buy sustainable palm oil and campaign for stricter monitoring of certifications, as well as reduce consumption of products using oils in general - be more conscious of the complexity of this (and other) issue(s) and consume mindfully where unavoidable :)
456 2018-11-20 23:22:54 We can't do anything abt Saudi cos they have huge influence on oil price. Doesn't matter if you can produce enough for your own thats not how market prices work. Saudi oil is one of the cheapest to extract(?). US ditches them others will pick up even the pretty masked Europeans.
457 2018-11-20 23:22:48 Right, Bob.  Let’s declare war on a huge oil supplier.  I never thought I’d see the day that a so-called Republican would function more as an ambassador to the Democrat Party.  At least you’re just a civilian now.
458 2018-11-20 23:22:43 Leave politics aside for a bit and think. Yes khashoggi was most likely killed with the prince knowing. They buy arms from us, they have oil that we use, they r needed for Middle East stability, Russia wants to set bases there. Would u severe ties w them over this? Be practical.

464 2018-11-20 23:22:37 I know we will likely due to oil needs support SA as we propped them up militarily for years...
I really don't like what they are doing in Yemen as that is genocide.
Yet I see that there has been some modernization and increasing freedom for women.
I see this Prince as corrupt.
465 2018-11-20 23:22:29 So they can do whatever they want because they have us held hostage, despite record domestic oil production
466 2018-11-20 23:22:10 1) issuance (only getting worse) 2) shorts have calls on 3) X-ccy basis makes USTs unattractive 4) oil is headline inflation but core will remain firm with wages still firming 5) traditional buyers absent (reasons other then X-ccy) 6) passive inv selling 7) wish I had more room
467 2018-11-20 23:22:10 Now we [Scots Indy thinkers] can legitimately use oil and its financial benefits in any argument about how we would support our economy ex-WM. Less of this pussy-footing and attempting to justify independence ex-oil revenue
468 2018-11-20 23:22:05 that'd assume the oil companies will drop prices at the pump just because the bottom has dropped out of crude...
469 2018-11-20 23:22:02 So Trump gives a green light to murderous regimes to continue their evil crimes against humanity.  The price in blood that we pay for oil is unacceptable.  Go GREEN, boycott Saudi products.  So sad!

473 2018-11-20 23:21:26 Ha! The pot was too hot for olive oil. Burnt it all up in smoke. Burnt up the garlic and herbs.
474 2018-11-20 23:21:25 Yes. And we do in fact countenance not just one murder but all kinds of daily atrocities in order to keep the oil flowing.
475 2018-11-20 23:21:21 Our economy is more dependent on real estate than AB’s is on oil. Take a guess 
476 2018-11-20 23:21:14 We'll just give us 40yrs of our oil money back and we'll call it quits then ?

Some are saying that it has to do with Iran as well but I really can't say if that's realistic or not.

487 2018-11-20 23:20:25 If the US put as much effort into EVs as China does, we wouldn’t need to care nearly as much about oil prices. A win for the environment and a win for morality! Oh, wait. I forgot that certain people with a ton of money would miss out on opportunities to make more money if we did

491 2018-11-20 23:19:54 That's what I'm wondering. Obama was pandering to Iran early in his first admin. He also help Iran and Turkey via ISIS, getting illegal oil across Syria. Obama and other foreign leaders had profits coming, via illegal, unsigned Iran DEAL. Imo.
492 2018-11-20 23:19:54 Thanks for your support and the work you do to promote sustainable palm oil in Europe

506 2018-11-20 23:18:14 Can this be installed on an older oil boiler, that uses a standard seven day timer.  No thermostats currently
507 2018-11-20 23:17:56 Confirmed by CIA? Where? There is no definitive word from CIA. Saudi buys arms for us - think jobs. Saudi is needed as a partner to stabilize the Middle East. They have control over oil which we all use. Russia is itching to set up military bases there. Things aren’t that simple.
508 2018-11-20 23:17:55 Lol I build shit. Power plants, oil refineries, car plants, steel mills, water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, food processing plants and more. Still don’t identify with your nonsense

514 2018-11-20 23:17:29 They are probably long crude oil and just need someone (anyone) to take it put on. Keep up the good work, Jim.

537 2018-11-20 23:13:57 But car companies had ads with women driving, and there were feel good stories about reform and a new era. What’s a murdered journalist? Women drive. They still have to die in fires bc they’re not veiled .. but oil and arms sales.

545 2018-11-20 23:13:02 Now America is being  reduced to the class  who have to kneel to money and oil, while shattering own FUNDAMENTAL value! AMERICA IS CORRODING ITS GREATNESS.
546 2018-11-20 23:13:00 *boiling is not ideal for spinach/kale either, a few minutes in a hot pan with some oil and garlic is way quicker with better taste, texture, & nutrient retention.
547 2018-11-20 23:12:59 That he chose to run the economy based on his beliefs rather than on professional advice is why we ended up in a recession, not due to oil prices falling or money being looted.

Fallen oil prices did not stop him from devaluing on time or removing subsidies on time.

Trump's has virtually given the Saudi's the green light to murder anyone who is critical of them.

556 2018-11-20 23:12:18 NONE OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WILL BE SOLVED ? AS LONG AS THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE A DOLLAR TO SQUEEZE OUT OF THE PUBLIC. THE OIL THAT IS IN THE GROUND IS PRECIOUS. THEY AIN'T MAKIN' IT ANY MORE, SAVE IT FOR FUTURE USE.
557 2018-11-20 23:12:10 Trump's complete lack of morals simply to protect a multi billion dollar arms deal and access to oil. How much is Trump earning personally from this deal with the Saudis?How much was his commission as this has nothing to do with 'protecting Americans'. via @ABCNews
558 2018-11-20 23:12:02 Honestly the past few months has made me rethink any long term career in esports. It’s more volatile than oil and gas and pays pennies unless you’re at the very top.

564 2018-11-20 23:11:35 What happened to Energy Independence, PRESIDENT TRUMP?  American Producers could do it, but America still depends on Saudi Arabia, to Produce high amounts of oil. This hurts American Producers, and American Refinery, & Oil Field Jobs.#MAGA @realDonaldTrump

567 2018-11-20 23:11:34 The American Administration has sold its moral soul to Saudi Arabia, its price is oil and military contracts. This gives despots like MBS, Jong Un, Putin the green light for out of country assignations. @ChrisCuomo
568 2018-11-20 23:11:22 @realDonaldTrump I support your position on Saudi Arabia. We need their oil and we need their business activity to maintain growth in jobs.
569 2018-11-20 23:11:20 Yes! I love rose water and rose hips oil.
570 2018-11-20 23:11:00 They'd certainly try, but they need to sell oil more than we need to buy it.  What else are they going to export, pot holders?

577 2018-11-20 23:10:14 So am I crazy or did Trump admit out loud that we only deal with Saudi Arabia to sell weapons and buy oil, and it's okay to kill American citizens as long as they're Muslim or journalists, preferably both

582 2018-11-20 23:10:05 Thanks to the Bakun oil field, the US is a net exporter of oil; if #MafiaDonTrump wanted America First, he would reduce exports to ensure our balance of production & consumption keeps US prices low w/surplus to the World market at prices based on the Rest-of-the-World prices.

Increased our coal exports by 60%; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time high.
584 2018-11-20 23:10:01 The private sector makes up a larger share of our GDP than both the govt and the oil sector, so it is only logical that a contraction in that sector would have a larger effect.

FYI, the oil sector made up just about 15% of our GDP in 2015, so it can't have led to a recession.
585 2018-11-20 23:09:57 That's a lie. @realDonaldTrump doesn't mind destroying the economy with his tariffs against all our allies that are only hurting the American farmers! but he does mind going against Saudi Arabia over oil?  sounds like shady dealing to me. When does American start to matter to him

593 2018-11-20 23:09:19 I’ll take Rob O’Neil’s version. How about you justify your total lack of holding the crown prince of Saudi Arabia accountable for his role in the murder?! Oil & $ shouldnt buy our silence! Maybe Israel’s PM Netanyahu can give you some much needed advice on dealing w/Mideast! 
594 2018-11-20 23:09:17 President Trump is in a quandary...trying to convict the prince of Saudi Arabia would be hard enough for an American court, but quietly known that the CIA keeps tabs on the Saudis, who state sponsored ISIS fighters and sell the majority of its oil to the US!

595 2018-11-20 23:09:15 I'm sorry are you expecting miracles from this meeting. Italy is broke with huge debts they probably just want to do a business in the oil, gas and mineral sectors in Federal Somalia, nothing sspecial.

600 2018-11-20 23:08:59 @BretBaier @johnrobertsFox #SpecialReport

Don't you think the Saudi Arabia decision was about Iran. Oil , the Petro dollar, Israel protection & forthcoming peace plan. I'm willing to bet that's much more important than arm sales is the balance of power in the middle east. Iran
601 2018-11-20 23:08:51 Everything has palm oil in it though.
602 2018-11-20 23:08:48 Great. Don’t pardon the Saudi prince! They aren’t doing as much as you think they are for us. Not buying as many arms, slowing down oil production. Where did the 9/11 hijackers all come from? Deal with his father, not him! Wake up & read!
603 2018-11-20 23:08:46 2) US has always supported dictators in ME as long as they pumped oil,made deals,kept stability in rehion. Maybe,finally, Americans will understand how destructive this policy has been for the regular man on the street & ask for change!!
604 2018-11-20 23:08:31 We tried that. Remember the solar panels we invested in? They went out of business after robbing us. 
But seriously, we can drill our own oil. Fk Saudi Arabia and fk Trump if he doesn't have the backbone to stand up to them.
605 2018-11-20 23:08:12 Looks like it would make a yummy lunch or dinner. The other key to #delicious Italian Food is having just the right sauce to go with it. I like to drizzle some Italian Olive Oil on top with some grated parmesan cheese #foodie #FoodieChats

616 2018-11-20 23:07:20 Clement Attlee carpet bombed Malaya with Agent Orange, sent warships to Iran when they nationalised their oil,  partitioned India resulting in millions of deaths & waged war on Korea.
617 2018-11-20 23:07:18 That’s why I stand w/ ya, Rand.
We don’t need Saudi Arabia!  The US ranks 1 for oil producing countries. 
We can keep decent relationships w/ Egypt & Jordan. SA is evil, we don’t need to kowtow to them BC of a faux relationship w/ Israel.
Israel, btw, can easily defend itself.
618 2018-11-20 23:07:17 Having the ability to export 10 million barrels of oil a day also helps.

621 2018-11-20 23:07:08 its OIL first
622 2018-11-20 23:07:03 Sure, but we're in a situation where that cost is going to be in flight prices and food and goods shipping costs, not transparently paid at the pump.

Shale's lasting impact may be cheap gasoline and expensive heating oil by driving conventional investment over a cliff.
623 2018-11-20 23:07:03 Weigh your options. But I'd make a public comment on shutting off oil to countrues.  And mention people (adam Schiff for 1) the reason you MAY do it.

626 2018-11-20 23:06:46 Wow and Ow. Bitcoin and oil drops continue. Two slick things that have nothing to do with each other. One cause or coincidence? Wondering.
627 2018-11-20 23:06:31 Their oil change prices are already ridiculous.
628 2018-11-20 23:06:30 The impact of these shutdowns is what led us into recession.

A perusal of NBS data will show you that we slipped into a recession when the private sector stopped growing and started contracting.

Even with poor oil revenue, the private sector kept us growing.

You hate Democrats then give up what we got for you, the right to vote.
650 2018-11-20 23:05:21 Do I understand this correctly? Even as people are screaming that our oil is so heavily discounted because there is not enough pipeline capacity,  that the pipelines are not really running at full capacity because companies are allowed to hold the space when they don't use it
651 2018-11-20 23:05:21 You mean like how the Americans and the British shat on the Iranian people by overthrowing their government to take their oil?

654 2018-11-20 23:05:13 The thing is, Trump is a hostage to fortune. He knows Saudi Arabia holds the whip hand. He has to protect the Oil Price, if Saudi Arabia restricts the Oil. It would be $300 a barrel and the whole world would be back in recession. His MAGA would be over.
655 2018-11-20 23:05:12 We don’t need their gas and oil. Trump has bragged about making $40 million with selling those suckers his brand name on his condos/hotels. They’re the biggest chumps for Trumps outside of the suckers who voted for him here.

Same Carbon footprint, same everything, just less profits for us. We take the risks, they get the profits. Insane

667 2018-11-20 23:03:56 Why the hell not, we've killed hundreds of thousands between Iraq & Afghanistan that never attacked us, some in Syria where we guard private oil fields in the north & ignore the thousands dying in Yemen while we're at it. May as well attack them for crimes against yemen at least.
668 2018-11-20 23:03:53 I don’t have the peanut oil to fry this turkey  let me run to the store real quick.

672 2018-11-20 23:03:39 today was a good day: 

- got my oil changed
- paid all my bills early 
- bought a new iPhone 
- worked out
- got excited about my tax return
673 2018-11-20 23:03:38 For what’s it worth trimmed a touch of my oil short via $DWT today but believe @RaoulGMI was way early but now it’s headed to low 40’s.
674 2018-11-20 23:03:37 Yes- I buy California olive oil now.
675 2018-11-20 23:03:36 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
676 2018-11-20 23:03:36 The sooner it runs out of oil the better
677 2018-11-20 23:03:18 I think it's due to oil.
678 2018-11-20 23:03:17 Naw I didn’t go the Drake concert. I got my oil change. This is the 6LACK concert

what you’ll need: 

1 pound dry spaghetti

4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 large eggs
1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
684 2018-11-20 23:02:47 See. You're just showing the eyes you're thick. Want peeps want is oil tankers at the end of the day  . Not drone shots of site. :(
685 2018-11-20 23:02:45 Does anyone else find it hilarious that Trump pulled a massive bluff over OPEC to get lower oil prices? Who would have thought this is where we’d be in 2018? 
686 2018-11-20 23:02:41 The Chinese don't seem to be losing sleep over the Middle East just buying oil and building infrastructure to all who want their support.
687 2018-11-20 23:02:34 I agree we still need oil/gas. I certainly understand we can't take a 180 away from our current reliance. However, transition needs to be at the forefront of discussion. Oh, and if one likes, they can find all sorts of verifiable evidence of fracking polluting well water.
688 2018-11-20 23:02:29 Don’t wanna fuck me I want argue baby oil well  gates voice 
689 2018-11-20 23:02:28 @realDonaldTrump U don’t give a flying fuck abt “America 1st”& “oil prices worry”or else U wouldn’t have plunged us in to massive debt W tax cuts to rich, troops to border, golfing trips & Melanie’s hotel bills & on & on for billions $$ U have ‘cost us’ to play your greedy game
690 2018-11-20 23:02:25 Isn't the US an oil exporter? so whatever price the Saudis charge for their oil has no purchase on domestic prices in the US? That, anyway, is the prophylaxis for arguments in favor of embargoing Iranian and Venezuelan oil…
691 2018-11-20 23:02:22 You know the experts keep saying we’ve reached peak oil but every year we see new records set. I reckon stupidity has went viral in the US as I am astounded by the levels we’ve reached and surpassed

701 2018-11-20 23:01:34 Saudi Arabia is an american Frenemy.
Similar to how one's favorite drug dealer is one's Frenemy.
Saudi Arabia is a richer Pakistan (with more oil & money ) and minus the nukes.
702 2018-11-20 23:01:26 The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was founded by Unilever - largest user of PalmOil at the time. Pretty hard to b sustainable when you burn 8 football fields of Rainforest/day for palm & fox watching henhouse. No such thing as sustainable palm #SayNo2PalmOil
703 2018-11-20 23:01:25 Absolutely disgusting.  At least have the balls to say the truth - hell, your base might even WANT that - “yeah he did it. So what?  We like him and they give us oil.”
704 2018-11-20 23:01:23 Trump's tariffs and increasing attempts to micromanage the economy (pressure on the Fed, calling for lower oil prices when they are already cratering) have a really good chance to wreck the economy.

707 2018-11-20 23:01:19 Amazing that my story is so similar. Started with being Dad’s go-fer. Then changing my own oil...then replacing a motor...never knew how much it all meant until he passed. Keepin the memory alive by doing my work on my own cars now....all with my own set of Craftsman tools.
708 2018-11-20 23:01:18 And there is the fierce moral leadership that Jerry Falwell Jr., Franklin Graham, and other white Evangelical leaders promised he would bring.  Ordering your men to do a murder is bad, but they have a bunch of oil and money and are out ally, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯?
709 2018-11-20 23:01:11 Under the Obama administration and every one before it we were full dependent on foreign oil. Enriching the Saudis as they steal the wealth of their people. Under trump we’re almost 100% self sufficient on oil — a matter of national security

712 2018-11-20 23:01:01 CBD oil is literally a mind blower. It doesn’t make you feel high or anything like that because it’s not THC or THC related even, it’s a completely different plant. I use it for everything. Leg pain, back pain, anxiety, depression. It helps a lot

725 2018-11-20 23:00:09 That explains why, when I use it at high temps, it disappears from the pan so fast. Thank you, I thought it was just because I was using cheap olive oil.

728 2018-11-20 22:59:58 TRUMP HAS BACKED Mr. Bone Saws by denying he ordered the MURDER AND DISMEMBERMENT of a VA-based Saudi journalist, contrary to CIA findings.
He says to do otherwise would tank the global economy (um, we export oil).
SA provided 19 of the 9/11 attackers.

731 2018-11-20 22:59:46 I’m not too sure about the housing sector. But to my knowledge. Trump wants the commodity price to be as low as possible. Especially with oil. If commodity prices are low. I’m guessing he believes he can get more manufacturing jobs to kick off in the U.S.

785 2018-11-20 22:56:07 False.

Nigeria's recession wasn't due to falling oil prices.

Those oil prices had fallen and stabilized before we went into recession.

Despite the fall in oil prices (since August 2014), Buhari still inherited a growing economy (by June 2016).

803 2018-11-20 22:55:08 @realDonaldTrump is WRONG.  Americans have died for centuries, for our VALUES .  Values like FREEDOM, LIBERTY and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. Donald Trump has failed his OATH OF OFFICE and sold a HUMAN LIFE for Weapons Sales & OIL. What a COWARD!
804 2018-11-20 22:55:07 Idk ask Obama about the hundred billion dollar arms deal, the jewels and gifts,Iran, the oil dependency.....

810 2018-11-20 22:54:37 But go ahead and keep saying it's not our daily addiction to oil, the need to churn every single human being for 40 hours a week and a totally obvious proclivity for HEROIN, OPOIDS and whatever other drug feeds the Criminal Courts.

811 2018-11-20 22:54:22 @POTUS is an idiot. Oil prices are AWFUL, economy is tanking, & we're still chasing Saudi oil while Saudis are busy investing in renewable energy 'cause THEY know the oil supply isn't unlimited....
812 2018-11-20 22:54:15 Mainly the money since there’s no possible way Mullah can replace oil revenue.
813 2018-11-20 22:54:08 I use 2 be a carb fiend but it’s incredible that I don’t crave carbs @ all. All of a sudden I crave sugar/sweets n I nvr n my life had a sweet tooth.

As Alastair Darling, ex UK Chancellor famously stated in 2008 -  "Scotland's Oil  has been underwriting the UK's failure to balance the books for Decades"

We will also charge you £15 million a year to keep Trident up here for a little longer.
818 2018-11-20 22:53:58 With what? There is no other fuel source that will come close to oil. Oil supplies us with a lot more then gas and diesel.
819 2018-11-20 22:53:57 When #TheresaMay says #BrexitDeal os good for Scotland as we will get back control of "our" waters she means Westminster retains control. Expect more tinkering of territorial boundries like they did to North Sea oil & gas. #indyref2

823 2018-11-20 22:53:48 4. Aapl has worst monthly drop since 2008.
5. Oil has literally crashed.

826 2018-11-20 22:53:35 What about oil?
827 2018-11-20 22:53:34 Did you miss the entire Bush administration? The @gop has been owned by the Saudis for years. Now you’ve sold part to Russia too.
Crush the axis of oil.
828 2018-11-20 22:53:28 Whoa there.. you’re talking to people in America who have shouted “no blood for oil” in the streets and who openly and consistently protest Trump.  No. Trump is not America.  He is a crazed tyrant.  And we, most certainly, are not him.
829 2018-11-20 22:53:21 Um yea that was my last time putting anything w/ coconut oil in my hair. Mess.
830 2018-11-20 22:53:18 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
831 2018-11-20 22:53:13 Paxton is best utilized by being chopped into quarters, doused in olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper then baked at 420 for 25 mins. He’s a spud.
832 2018-11-20 22:53:13 I can toss them out all day, my friend. But I think we’ve come close to using them oil up.
833 2018-11-20 22:53:05 “Sure, he wears a towel on his head but his big beautiful oil money bailed my family out of mutliple bankruptcies...” is that somewhat accurate ??@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner
834 2018-11-20 22:53:04 Congrats to @LHSLL Secretary and former coach @tylerpgray on being named Interim President of Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas!
835 2018-11-20 22:52:59 The US is the #1 Oil producer in the world. Also, fuck Oil! Get a @Tesla
836 2018-11-20 22:52:53 Terrible state of affairs but let’s get brutally real.  How important would upholding principles be if your constituents are paying $6 to $7 per gallon?  That’s what could potentially happen if Saudi oil is removed from the world market?

842 2018-11-20 22:52:33 Was thinking maybe I'd cook pheasant for dinner. The last time I did that though, I burned the crap out of my arm with hot oil 
843 2018-11-20 22:52:27 And Canada would be looking forward to receiving world oil prices for our precious resources  instead of $45 below actual value.
It's truly amazing how badly the Trudeau government screwed up. Unacceptable!
Notley too screwed up with her rediculous partnership with Trudeau.

846 2018-11-20 22:52:19 JFC! Get the story straight. The Saudis keep the global oil market denominated in $. Without it, the currency implodes. Further, Saudis reinvest petrodollars in the US & western economies. We’re inextricably linked at the hip. The Cranes are Confined to the Nest. #Go
847 2018-11-20 22:52:11 The guy who just changed my oil turned my seat warmer on for me & yeah maybe I’m crying
848 2018-11-20 22:51:57 United States gets 40% of it's oil from Canada, 11% from Saudi.
Canada was named as a national security threat, Saudi not so much. 
911 ring a bell. Oh and Canada took in US planes and took care of American citizens during this crisis. Hmmm.

861 2018-11-20 22:50:57 Castor oil is more of a sealant , so won’t penetrate your hair unless you use something water based or something light like almond / rosemary/ oilve oil . 
If you dont layer it right you can end up drying out your hair in the long run

864 2018-11-20 22:50:41 Demand on the whole up 6.2% year over year in the trailing 4 weeks in the last EIA weekly...

Gasoline is not the full demand story, and shale generates a lot more gasoline than distillate/jet fuel/heating oil. Hence the blowout in gasoline inventories.
865 2018-11-20 22:50:39 I cannot help but think that the Oil needs an entire training staff change. There is a lack of training performance and conditioning that has been there since 2007

868 2018-11-20 22:50:25 Stop producing 10m barrels of oil a day
869 2018-11-20 22:50:25 We don’t know , bcoz of State elections oil prices are reduced. The same happens during Karnataka elections
870 2018-11-20 22:50:23 The Dem objective in forcing Saudi sanctions - Oil will hit $ 150 / barrel damaging the U.S. & world economy. loss of millions of US jobs, stock market goes down, defense industries lay off, revenues shrink so steel, coal industries begin to shut down.

879 2018-11-20 22:49:30 You tell me is keeping the price of oil down worth more than the brutal murder of one American? Trump thinks so. Stop it now or all American's lives will be only worth what Trump deems them to be.
880 2018-11-20 22:49:29 Which refiners? Most crude is bought by Citgo, PDVSA's subsidiary. Other two large buyers are Valero -which lobbied against sanctions through AFPM and has increased purchases since sanctions were announced- and Chevron, who in practical terms sends oil it produces in VZ to itself

891 2018-11-20 22:48:26 @NicolleDWallace, a thought: Blood #oil is like #blood #diamonds. #Journalist lives should not be the price of oil.
892 2018-11-20 22:48:23 It's about your money first, then it's about Saudi money, and then oil company revenues, America is way down the list.

cowshed  
Moisturized and put peppermint oil in my hair. I did that and constantly twisted my hair... that’s honestly how my hair grew so fast but after the first year I didn’t do much to it but co washing it and moisturizing
895 2018-11-20 22:48:12 We don't need their oil tho. It's more like blood money for future Trump properties..
896 2018-11-20 22:48:08 oh man,,, or Old people like me! LOL...
Soylent Green is real... That might be where us old people end up?
897 2018-11-20 22:47:58 More deception (lies) from the Notley NDP.
Just imagine if Gateway North was allowed to go ahead. Where would Canada's oil industry be now? We would actually have a very viable pipeline near completion, good hard working people would be working and be trained for jobs.

900 2018-11-20 22:47:48 Words. We will be watching. The entire world will be watching. @realDonaldTrump takes blood money. Oil prices over a life? @realDonaldTrump is scum. The whole world is watching.

918 2018-11-20 22:46:45 This advert needs to be seen.

922 2018-11-20 22:45:48 The President today explained to the American people that it is extremely important for us to not damage our relationship with murderers, because other murderers exist in the world. Plus, missile sales. And oil prices.

925 2018-11-20 22:45:38 how much does a transaction between a human life and oil business cost?            I think the Democrats should take the opportunity
926 2018-11-20 22:45:34 1. Because Americans don't want to see a sky-high increase in oil prices.
2. Because Americans don't care about the murder of a terrorist-turned-journalist.
Duh!
927 2018-11-20 22:45:30 Furthermore,  The energy sector contributed 213 billion dollars to the nominal gross domestic product in 2017, or 11% of total nominal gross domestic product. ... Including indirect activities, Canada's energy sector accounts for 11% of GDP. Energy not just oil & gas.
928 2018-11-20 22:45:29 You're naive if you think this issue is about just Trump. Rather than offer a meaningless platitude followed by no action like other Presidents have done. Orange Man puts it bluntly that Saudi Oil owns us.
929 2018-11-20 22:45:28 If you are looking for good signs...Ok mediocre signs...Oil getting crushed helps a bit here. 1.

“After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world.” -- And, presumably, THIS justifies...
932 2018-11-20 22:45:04 When the value of the American dollar is based on the cost of a barrel of oil he is protecting American interests by not rocking the boat with the Saudi. No amount of liberal moral rubbish would stop poor American families being pushed further into poverty due to this. Be careful
933 2018-11-20 22:45:01 Trump indicated today that our economy would be “destroyed” if we held Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Kashoggi. How is it possible that a few military contracts and higher oil prices can break us economically?

936 2018-11-20 22:44:57 Let’s be honest here though, no president in modern American history would stand up to them because we depend on their money and oil. As much as I loathe Trump, no one would have stood up to them. Not after we didn’t do shit about 9/11.
937 2018-11-20 22:44:57 What is it we need you for, exactly? We have plenty of oil.
938 2018-11-20 22:44:54 Peppermint oil!!!
939 2018-11-20 22:44:52 Bomb them. Your arms manufacturers sold them the weapons, now it's time to bomb their archaic monarchy out of existence. Then give them expensive loans to rebuild their country while you take their oil. Iraq 2.0.
940 2018-11-20 22:44:50 This coconut oil feel so good to my scalp
941 2018-11-20 22:44:35 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
942 2018-11-20 22:44:34 Do you know Canada is obliged to sell 75% of its oil to the USA and had to re-adjust its patent laws to match so that drug companies can make more $$. Every trade deal is going to have some of that, you always have to give up something. More deals more giving something up.
943 2018-11-20 22:44:31 Reached the age where a free car vacuuming during an oil change literally makes my whole day.
944 2018-11-20 22:44:28 Everybody hurts by REM. And instead of the graphic, just use the pic of McDavids face when the Oil won the lottery
945 2018-11-20 22:44:28 unreal,  USA economy is going down, markets being the barometer and you making it worst by having Pence talks against China. Potus screwed  OPEC by lies and trickery, and that by leaving Iran export all the oil they want.  What Americana see is a president that cannot be trusted.
946 2018-11-20 22:44:25 Another way to say it is that the earnings recession AND falling oil prices were driven by a rising dollar
947 2018-11-20 22:44:12 you mean it wasn't already meaningless? It's basically just something they stick on large oil producing countries, and Venezuela also having a socially progressive outlook that fly's in the face of the "Wests" fascist self-interests make them and even greater target..
948 2018-11-20 22:44:12 There’s a fine line there. How far do we push ourselves into other countries affairs? I thought Rand Paul would want less of that. I don’t disagree, but there’s a million different angles. Why don’t we start good clean oil drilling in Alaska, then we can play hard ball w/ Saudis

952 2018-11-20 22:43:52 got my SUV serviced yesterday.. breaks, oil change, new tires balanced and rotated
953 2018-11-20 22:43:35 how can you be a detractor against renewable energy?  why not 100%?

american's invented lightbulb, airplanes, radio, television, laser, transistor, integrated circuits, personal computers, rockets to mars, internet.

why does it all stop because some people got rich off oil.
954 2018-11-20 22:43:30  so if you invest do opposite of what Trump says...oil?
955 2018-11-20 22:43:28 I drizzle the tiniest amount of olive oil on my bebes, season them with salt and pepper, I sprinkle on minced garlic and  then drip some lemon juice on em. I bake them at 430° for 15 minutes

958 2018-11-20 22:43:11 Whatcha thinkin', Paul? Oil? Putin and oil? Other? now I want to know.
959 2018-11-20 22:43:00 American lives and laws have just been compromised by the price of oil, as in Trump will not allow oil prices to rise out of control versus Saudi Arabia will pay for the murder of a United States citizen. HELLO, SENATORS DO YOU JOB NOW.
960 2018-11-20 22:42:52 This is so yummy!! Best ever dairy free, palm oil free spread you’ll find out there. So pleased we can now buy it in the UK.
961 2018-11-20 22:42:50 Lmao I’m serious. Cooking eggs is pretty easy. Put a pan on medium high then wait for it to get hot, add a bit of oil or butter then crack your egg in there. Don’t touch it just let cook. After a while move the pan, if the eggs slide flip it let it cook then. The end.
962 2018-11-20 22:42:27 "He" literally cited (during press conference today) oil prices as a primary motive in not holding Saudis accountable. When did state-sponsorship of assassination start coming with an Exxon gas card?
963 2018-11-20 22:42:27 Yesjulz puts coconut oil in her car.
964 2018-11-20 22:42:25 At Walmart getting an oil change. Smh two hr wait.
965 2018-11-20 22:42:22 He's only thinking of the oil price.
966 2018-11-20 22:42:21 When ever you apply a moisturiser/ carrier oil
967 2018-11-20 22:42:20 This might seem pedantic but if as many people ate palm oil as did eat meat, palm oil would be much more damaging, so you saying the meat industry in and of itself being more damaging is questionable. Even the small demand for palm oil in comparison is having a very big impact
968 2018-11-20 22:42:15 My first comment was about wars for oil. You're changing the topic bringing up sea lanes. Sea lanes dont give ppl war fatigue from endless wars. Good luck with your goal post moving conversations.
969 2018-11-20 22:42:12 I need a hot oil treatment I know that!
970 2018-11-20 22:42:11 Why does @realDonaldTrump think low oil prices are good but low steel prices are bad?
971 2018-11-20 22:42:04 Hmm... Oil? @cathmckenna, like @JustinTrudeau, loves attention and doesn't realize that they are just buffoons

974 2018-11-20 22:41:55 Have you ever noticed a white haze on the surface of chocolate?This is known as fat bloom!#Lonchampt suggests that fat bloom formation is accelerated in filled chocolates due to the high oil content in the center and the migration of unsaturated TAGs. @UofGFoodProf #Food2150
975 2018-11-20 22:41:49 He just dey check engine oil.
976 2018-11-20 22:41:49 Unsurprising. There's money in them corpses! Glad I wasn't taken in by their posturing over palm oil.
977 2018-11-20 22:41:43 What did you expect from Trump? Do you think he would jeopardize billions of contracts and a cheap oil for a Saudi murdered by Saudis.
978 2018-11-20 22:41:42 I don't buy for an instant that Trump has a clue as to who or how oil prices are negotiated. Tillerson certainly does but I doubt he ever wasted his breath talking to Trump about it.
979 2018-11-20 22:41:27 I mean, I fell off teh blue curb on a four-wheeled scooter. Wouldn't you have left an oil slick!?
980 2018-11-20 22:41:25 Just cuz I have tits doesn’t mean I don’t know what kind of oil to get k thanks

986 2018-11-20 22:40:50 Are you using palm oil in your manufacturing process?
987 2018-11-20 22:40:46 Is it funny nothing on hundreds of journalist killed in Mexico !  Yet since it advance their policy of force a electric cars on you . By a opec cut off oil off to USA like they did in 70s . They have a fit or is it plain their racist as it's only Mexicans ?
988 2018-11-20 22:40:43 Can anybody change my brakes and oil I will pay
989 2018-11-20 22:40:35 私にとっては油温計がリミッターになりそうです。(^_^;)

993 2018-11-20 22:40:16 use butter as a sub for oil
994 2018-11-20 22:40:14 Healing oils like Jamaican black castor oil, vitamin e oil , apple cider vinegar is a great scalp wash, Neem oil is good also bentonite clay or other clays are good scalp washes and keep your hair detangled
995 2018-11-20 22:40:11 how much does a transaction between a human life and oil business cost? you never have the right to talk about human rights again
996 2018-11-20 22:40:07 @CadburyUK Please can you let me know if you use palm oil in your factories?
997 2018-11-20 22:40:06 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
998 2018-11-20 22:40:04 I just heard President Donald Trump saying something about the oil going through the roof we're going to keep oil prices just like it is now why he want to send oil prices sky High for right i own oil and gas i believe its at a good price right now i know why he doing he crooked
999 2018-11-20 22:39:56 Look at the UN Human Development Index. There has not been any country in the top 25 for a sustained period of time that is closed. The only exception being Hong Kong, but it's a special case. Closed countries come and go, for instance depending on the price of oil.
1000 2018-11-20 22:39:55 Ahhhhhhhh Jack Ass, oil prices are controlled by OPEC and wall street commodity traders, NOT YOU!!!!!!
1001 2018-11-20 22:39:54 @justice4JK @CNN @DonaldJTrump America cannot be first if you DT turn your back on a horrific murder esp. when you know the killer. "It is what it is" (your statement) pathetic esp. to the family of Mr. Khashoggi - is not his death worth a few more cents on a barrel of oil???

1003 2018-11-20 22:39:43 This whole thing is scary as heck. There are so many opportunities for something to go very, very bad out in that ocean in this industry. And any amount of oil spillage is very, very bad, in my opinion.
1004 2018-11-20 22:39:15 And the audio exists!  This is horrific. He said the arms deal and oil prices are at stake. Money before morals. Put that in latin on the trump family coat of arms. 

He is a coward not a leader. He and Jared have money at risk
1005 2018-11-20 22:39:08 If you think the don't eat your lettuce scare is conspiracy by the oil companies because you have drive it back to the store...stretcch
1006 2018-11-20 22:39:06 how is letting a foreign country murder a resident of the US because of tremendous oil deals and Jared's debts remotely American?
1007 2018-11-20 22:39:04 8/ what KSA may have to offer for few decades and might be the last possibility for KSA to plan what to do after oil is gone, one could say - he is unlikely - but still the best bet for salvator (maybe not Salvator Mundi of Leonardo he already bought) but at least Salvator Saudi
1008 2018-11-20 22:39:03 Big down Candle on Brent Oil Spot and failure of Support etc at $65 not good. RSI 21 very low though. DAX down Candle and broke Support at 11050 which is bad. Bearish MACD Cross today. RSI 31 is low though but was RSI 25 recently. CAC40 similar.
1009 2018-11-20 22:39:03 So what are you saying Lindsey? Cancel Billions of Dollars in Military contracts. Risk having them as allies in the Middle East. Possibly have higher oil prices levied against us. For what? A Saudi Journalist who was anti Saudi Arabia and killed in Turkey.
1010 2018-11-20 22:39:00 For a fact, cement is more expensive in Nigeria than in the UK. And yet people say Dangote this. Dangote that. Giving him monopoly for refining of crude oil will be the final nail on the coffin of Nigeria. Shine your eyes Nigerians!
1011 2018-11-20 22:38:56 Yea, has nothing to do with the price of oil, nothing whatsoever!
1012 2018-11-20 22:38:54 i walk by like 3 places that advertise cbd oil in the windows on my way home from work, which i guess makes sense since weed isn't legal here, but idk how i feel about it
1013 2018-11-20 22:38:40 I wonder if Tom Zanetti uses Castor oil on his eyelashes
1014 2018-11-20 22:38:39 And buy a pine scented candle. They even make ceramic ornaments you fill with a pine scented oil. Boom! Christmas nostalgia.
1015 2018-11-20 22:38:33 Sanction them publicly and give them something else in private. It's simple. It's not just oil, it's defence budgets, regional security support (richest and biggest spenders in the region + biggest/influential Arab country). It is not as cut and dried as people make it out to be.
1016 2018-11-20 22:38:31 How often should you out castor oil on your scalp?!?! I’m out here nozzling everyday
1017 2018-11-20 22:38:28 Strange how oil keeps on melting.
1018 2018-11-20 22:38:27 Him or oil?
1019 2018-11-20 22:37:55 I was gonna make me a sandwich.. there is no ham.. I was gonna make tuna.. there is no mayo... I was gonna make eggs.. there is no oil.. :)))) and my mom asks why I don’t gain weight..
1020 2018-11-20 22:37:53 I am one person who is a sickened and livid over #Khashoggi's killing! FUCK TRUMP FUCK SAUDI ARABIA FUCK OLIGARCHY FUCK WARS FUCK OIL FUCK GREED FUCK EVIL!
1021 2018-11-20 22:37:52 Did you really used oil based polymer paint? Was that the right stuff 0.0
1022 2018-11-20 22:37:44 Nope I work in oil and gas. We make highly specialised subsea equipment that goes in around the world. I’m in Norway so used FoM to move here. I still don’t know what my end status will be and the clock is ticking.
Some of us have skin in the game, others just talk shit.
1023 2018-11-20 22:37:40 We don’t need their oil. We have our own
1024 2018-11-20 22:37:38 If he gets the whole team to improve defensively, yes.
1025 2018-11-20 22:37:38 I guess anyone who uses gasoline is complicit. If only we had some sort of oil reserve the United states, so we didn’t have to depend on these ruthless criminals. If only we didn’t regulate hybrid car companies so strictly. Lots of complaints, no solutions. Getting tired...
1026 2018-11-20 22:37:35 Help keep prices of Oil down? We are the number one exporter of oil in the world! They want oil prices to rise. @POTUS
1027 2018-11-20 22:37:32 Opinion from the bleacher crowd and people on the street. CNN and Acosta are a national disgrace. Attempting to make a fool of the elected President is a wrong in the worst of ways. The damage is to America has global implications.
 
Advertisers - Is it worth it!
1028 2018-11-20 22:37:30 Incorrect, the NDP got into power because of vote splitting between the Wild Rose Party & PC’s. NDP got in because conservatives split the vote. 
Also, Norway has more pipelines that almost all the EU combined, they don’t hamper oil or energy production & exports
1029 2018-11-20 22:37:29 The killing is not outrageous but dismemberment,Islamically it is unlawfull. Saudi is a corner stone and at the same time a high oil producer so trump act on not throwing the kingdom is right becouse he is fighting for his gunny sack.
1030 2018-11-20 22:37:25 That was fun watching ,thanks Celeste and Lori and for answering my question on oil , would love to work on environment concerns
1031 2018-11-20 22:37:23 The President and the U.S. Government care more about oil and money than a man’s life. This is so shameful. It makes me sick. There is great evil in the world and our President has sided with it. This is rock bottom. The end of everything that the USA is supposed to represent.
1032 2018-11-20 22:37:21 Yes, but it will take at least a couple of weeks. Assuming, of course, that oil doesn’t rally from here. Which is likely, given that the market is oversold in the short-term and we usually get a Santa rally
1033 2018-11-20 22:37:14 I tried canned smoked oysters in olive oil over spinach for lunch today and it was freaking awesome (and so easy!).
1034 2018-11-20 22:37:12 You probably get more oil from Canada. Anyways, hopefully he won't get reelected.
1035 2018-11-20 22:37:05 @BrijinderB I CAN DEVELOP ELECTRICITY FROM AND OR USING STILL AIR. 100%POLLUTION FREE.
IT WOULD MAKE NUCLEAR, OIL, COAL, GAS OUT OF DATE. 
WHY WORLD IS NOT FINANCING ME TO STOP WORLD CLIMATE CHANGE. 
ONLY MY KIND OF ELECTRICITY CAN SAVE THE WORLD FROM DESTRUCTION.
1036 2018-11-20 22:37:04 @marcorubio I am so sad. President Trump has chosen to overlook the murder of Jamal Kashoggi in exchange for purported advantages in oil prices and "jobs." (He also volunteered, without being asked, that he does "no business" with Saudi Arabia-Why?).
1037 2018-11-20 22:37:00 Many mathematicians & analysts would assert that the correlation between rising/high #fuel/#oil/#gasoline prices & harm to U.S. #economy & danger to a 1st-term incumbent president remains viable & is not a relic of the past, especially if #wages have been stagnant for decades.
1038 2018-11-20 22:37:00 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water
1039 2018-11-20 22:36:55 There many countries at the forefront of being demonized by the US that committed drastically way less human rights abuses than Saudi Arabia but hey you gotta get that oil right?
1040 2018-11-20 22:36:46 onions lettuce tomato oil vinegar and spices #JMSweepstakes
1041 2018-11-20 22:36:44 The Saudis need our market more than we need their oil.
1042 2018-11-20 22:36:36 Canada is selling weapons to Saudi Arabia and buying their oil.  Seems nobody plans to change policy towards Saudi Arabia.
1043 2018-11-20 22:36:26 Alas, it is important to recognise that though assets like crypto and crude oil have seen big declines, when you zoom out of broad assets, the selloff has hardly even begun. I think there’s a long way to go lower over time. Remember to wait for the bounce to make your next sale.
1044 2018-11-20 22:36:23 4. Also, I’m a big fan of @ReformedBroker but I disagree with the inference that we have that much economically recoverable reserves in the US, even at $70-$80 oil.
1045 2018-11-20 22:36:23 Here is a look at the factors behind oil’s decline in world markets.
1046 2018-11-20 22:36:14 Try a warm bath with lavender oil, baking soda and epsom salt, stay in at least 15 minutes.... weird, but it totally works
1047 2018-11-20 22:36:14 Oil first. Americans last.
1048 2018-11-20 22:36:05 Honestly its really dumbfounding. All of the evidence appears to point to the crown prince calling for the execution of the journalist. I don’t see why it’s so hard for him to condemn the action unless Saudi oil is worth more than a life.
1049 2018-11-20 22:36:01 The US is also exporting oil. Which means every barrel they sell they get USD. Inflation. Bringing USD home brings home inflation too.

1053 2018-11-20 22:35:32 how can we help get the world to care about the environment, when our idiot pres says climate change science is hoax by the Chinese, & puts an oil stooge in charge of the EPA? don't forget it was conservatives who sided with big tobacco, opposed civil rights,& supported slavery.

1057 2018-11-20 22:35:15 And that would Saudi oil?

1059 2018-11-20 22:35:10 Not feeling the protection at this point though. No repercussions for MBS- Saudi Arabia, because well.. you know.. oil. Oh and Trumps investments with them. Trump is just as evil as Putin.
1060 2018-11-20 22:35:09 We do not live in a bubble and need to consider future oil prices. Big picture partisan Ben...thoughts...

1063 2018-11-20 22:35:01 Is there a reason for using 2 types of oil?
1064 2018-11-20 22:35:00 No

But it helps.  You'd be amazed how often kids of friends get internships

His parents immigrated from Greece. All he's done ever is work on oil flowing from Israel to Cyprus and Greece to avoid Turkey.  Highly specific.

1066 2018-11-20 22:34:54 Today’s food is gluten free pretzel pizza from scratch. Tossed some flour, oil, sugar, water, and yeast into a bowl, played with it for a while until it looked like dough. Flattened it to a pizza crust, rolled string cheese up in the edge, and dropped it in hot baking soda water.
1067 2018-11-20 22:34:51 so tired of literally all CGI animation being either equated to or just straight up falsely credited to Pixar. Like it's just a technique, you don't say that ALL oil painting is "Van Gogh-like" or ALL electronic music is "Daft Punk-like"
1068 2018-11-20 22:34:49 How old? 

It happened to us at 7. :( 

Have you tried fish oil or CBD?

1071 2018-11-20 22:34:39 Year ago we saw same trend and investment banks called for 20 bucks 1Q18. Never happened equally with billions of oil in reserves price gets easily too high. Time for stakeholders to stop manipulation.
1072 2018-11-20 22:34:36 Finally getting my tires, an alignment and an oil change. Been months in the process 
1073 2018-11-20 22:34:36 Crazy Fool Thought, You just ready to destabilize the region, ... To create Oil Problem, Terrorism, to magnified Iran, to create problems on Job and on Economy. 
You are Wrong, Trump is write.
1074 2018-11-20 22:34:35 Yall relationships failing cause yall putting marriage expectations on dating situations... that's oil and water, it won't mix bruh bruh  #godswork #thelightofman #kingdombred #winsday
1075 2018-11-20 22:34:32 3. actual reserve potential. We have a good industry here, but we still need foreign oil and, like every other “new” industry, unconventional oil and gas development has been pumped full of Wall Street steroids and is grossly overvalued. IMO
1076 2018-11-20 22:34:30 I haven’t been in this much pain since my spinal surgery!

Amazing the pain from an abscess, fuck me! Antibiotics, clove oil and a shit load of pain relief to knock me out so I can actually sleep.

If your dick is under 5” , you owe me to make me feel better  #findom
1077 2018-11-20 22:34:28 Let's not forget him basically admitting he'll believe whatever the Saudi crown prince tells him as long as he promises to buy more weapons and sell more oil.
1078 2018-11-20 22:34:27 would you say he’s covered in....snake oil
1079 2018-11-20 22:34:17 Russia also buying ISIS oil keeping that terror org viable. 

Why isn't Putin locked in Gitmo? @SecPompeo
1080 2018-11-20 22:34:06 Drown me in olive oil
1081 2018-11-20 22:34:02 Saudi Arabia IS one of our allies.  As long  as SA provides oil to THE WORLD we will continue to be allies.
1082 2018-11-20 22:33:59 here we go !   love oil
1083 2018-11-20 22:33:57 The dude at the auto shop today called me ma’am 4 times when I was paying for my oil change 
1084 2018-11-20 22:33:56 15 of 19 terrorists of 9/11 were Saudis, Bin Laden's family has a corp in #KSA and #USA keep making business buying oil and selling them weapons, don’t expect nothing about #Kashoggi's state murder. #Trump is a pet of the wahhabism sponsors.

1085 2018-11-20 22:33:54 The Government/Oil Industry has lied to us for 30 years about global catastrophic climate destabilization. The IPCC has downplayed severity.
1086 2018-11-20 22:33:51 Maxine here Founder of Vegan Apron. I’ve lost a stone of weight by eating a plant-based oil free diet! Oh and portion control!
1087 2018-11-20 22:33:30 Oil price slumps 7% today...@Tesco will soon be paying me to fill up 
1088 2018-11-20 22:33:26 I luv how everyone on this thread knows all. And what would you like him to do? Let’s here a solution that won’t backfire on us nor have the Saudis cut off oil exports to our allies in Europe whom would be hobbled without it. An ally without fuel can’t help us in a conflict.
1089 2018-11-20 22:33:16 All of those tourists covered with oil.
1090 2018-11-20 22:33:00 Life update: I am growing increasingly evangelical about canola oil. @tanseyclaire, this is your doing!
1091 2018-11-20 22:32:49 Oil. Oil is thicker than blood I guess.
1092 2018-11-20 22:32:41 Let’s be factual here Michael; unwavering US support for the violent, misogynistic regime in Saudi Arabia didn’t start with Trump. It’s been central to US foreign policy since Standard Oil and BP created the regime; Obama, Bush and both Clintons  suckholed the regime for years.
1093 2018-11-20 22:32:30 It's Saudi Oil First. Get it?
1094 2018-11-20 22:32:25 Yes. So true. Oil companies and pharmaceutical companies hold such power.
1095 2018-11-20 22:32:21 You may get your 1.6 mb/d cut from higher demand & reduced investment upstream now that oil is no longer profitable for a high percentage of producers. While rigged and painful, this is the best thing that could happen to oil long term if you are an  investor or producer.
1096 2018-11-20 22:32:18  *punches in the chest* dawgggg wyd???! That’s on another level of suicide lol. You need some Milk thistle oil and Ashwagandha oil ASAP
1097 2018-11-20 22:32:11 The US is selling oil on the world market and has been since well before the orange mammal took office.  So we don't really need Middle-Eastern oil.  They need us far  more than we need them.
1098 2018-11-20 22:32:06 if I put coconut oil all over my heart will it fix it or??
1099 2018-11-20 22:32:06 Few weeks ago Oil about 85 dollars a barrel. Today 62. Dropped about 25%. Prices at pumps, no change. Big oil taking the piss, pathetic, no Gov will take them on, screwed
1100 2018-11-20 22:31:50 america first there4 let saudi arabia do whatever tf they want there4 big oil keeps making all the $$
1101 2018-11-20 22:31:45 Wondering what the difference is between Liz Warren & President Trump(For who I voted) ... Trump has now Destroyed Tech(investigations), Oil/Gas with the (Iran Sanctions SWINDLE), Biotech (Price Controls) & Commodities/Industrials (With the EASY TO WIN Trade War) @Trish_Regan
1102 2018-11-20 22:31:44 American people are fortunate oil prices have tanked as Trumps trade war has wiped out tiny tax break for avg families BUT what is that saying about economy and global growth? Red alert?? Stock mkt now lower than when tax cut put in place.
1103 2018-11-20 22:31:24 Trump executing his natural narratives spin of BS inflicting fear on the public that oil prices will go high, totally hypothetical but he's must look after his ego first family 2nd for sales of properties to Saudis and Russian crooks, loans from Saudi Arabia for him and Kushner
1104 2018-11-20 22:31:20 すいすい水曜日は睡眠の日～

1106 2018-11-20 22:31:10 DO NOT EVERRRR GET YOUR OIL CHANGED AT WALMART!!!
1107 2018-11-20 22:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?
1108 2018-11-20 22:31:03 And Darwin grins.

In the spirit of the holidays, and because I’m an old kind soul, a tip for first time fryers: bubbling oil takes up a lot more volume than cold water if you’re doing the turkey/cold water displacement method to measure. You’ll need way less than you think. :)
1109 2018-11-20 22:30:54 US Standard Oil tried this in the late 1800s, 'price gouging' and buying up competitors. It didn't work out well for them. Markets don't behave exactly the same as evolutionary biological processes. They are similar in many ways, but the results are not the same.
1110 2018-11-20 22:30:52 Wait till 20 B in military equipment is sold to em & we have the money, we'll be oil independent very shortly, then Sadi Arabia can kiss our ass, we mite even destroy all that equipment, if its paid for. Ya never know?
1111 2018-11-20 22:30:40 The ONLY thing standing between us and the Debt Monster is the US Dollar's status as a Utility Token required to use the Saudi oil app.  Which is why, it doesn't matter what they do, it doesn't matter who's President, we're forced to keep the relationship intact. Or? Monster.
1112 2018-11-20 22:30:35 the best long lasting matte lipstick I've ever use is drugstore maybelline matte ink, it's quite drying but binch... once you put it, it stays forever, I literally have to SOAK it in cleansing oil and use some peeling... still worth it

1115 2018-11-20 22:30:28 KSA is notorious for not paying, ask oil execs.
1116 2018-11-20 22:30:18 Oil slumps 7 percent as equities slide fuels demand worries
1117 2018-11-20 22:30:15 That report very clearly showed the support of that country was not about #currency. I only argue that #russia is most likely the largest oil producer in the world.
1118 2018-11-20 22:30:02 US | API Crude Oil Stock Change  for november: -1545000.0 (Prev: 8790000.0)
1119 2018-11-20 22:30:00 Nope. But right now hemp is illegal to grow in the u.s.a. only reason being is it is direct competition for big pharma, oil industry , cotton , construction. U can import it but we're not allowed to grow it here. Another injustice due to corporate greed.

1121 2018-11-20 22:29:57 Doesn’t it seem like oil is the driving force of a lot ?
1122 2018-11-20 22:29:51 So opec cuts off oil like they did in the 70s . All so you can ram a electric car on you  as can you afford to pay 20 a gallon gas And doubles prices on everything ? Dems think so .
1123 2018-11-20 22:29:47 And another lie...I have kept oil prices down. No, they just went down two weeks ago after hitting highest level in years. Money over morals. That's trump's mantra.
1124 2018-11-20 22:29:43 Has anyone seen that snake oil salesman go to church?  Anyone?
1125 2018-11-20 22:29:41 My low tire pressure has been on for a week, change oil has been flashing at me the last two weeks, I’m low on gas and now I’m sitting in the savage parking lot because my car has no oil..... 
1126 2018-11-20 22:29:38 It's not olive oil in a cesar?
1127 2018-11-20 22:29:36 Crude Oil 53.39-3.81 (-6.66%)
1128 2018-11-20 22:29:29 Amazon accounts for 44% of online sales. That number is STAGGERING. They should NOT be buying up media, and we all need to be thinking about trust-busting some of these tech companies that are HUGE. They control our lives as much as Big oil and railroads did 100 years ago.
1129 2018-11-20 22:29:28 I expect a couple things to happen. He mentioned the kids. I expect to see a young puck moving D and prob Pulju called up to inject some speed and puck moving from back end.
1130 2018-11-20 22:29:27 America consumes so much oil byproducts on a daily basis that it doesn't have enough oil production to keep it self sufficient. As for the strategic reserve, that would last about 6 months at most.
1131 2018-11-20 22:29:24 Not one of the last 5 people who sat in the oval office would have done anything differently, probably would have hidden the response with some well-choreographed smoke and mirror routines that come with years of snake oil salesman training politicians go through!
1132 2018-11-20 22:29:18 Here is a look at the factors behind oil’s decline in world markets.
1133 2018-11-20 22:29:16 Play politics all you can but don't ascribe issues inappropriately. Since you do not understand, recessions happen when the economy slows and there's no buffer to prevent it. SA recession was majorly caused by the bad weather whislt that of Nigeria was drop in crude oil prices.
1134 2018-11-20 22:29:12 krain krain is cooked as a single sauce with all ingredients while obiata is the krain krain leaves boil seprate and is later mix wit the palm oil sauce cooked seperatly. It is more slimy( dea draw) more than the normal krain krain sauce.

1137 2018-11-20 22:29:05 I fully agree with Dr K.
If you really want spend a few time with us because you *really* want it, just stay on line 1h just for chilling. No oil show tonight. Just relax and good music for 1h. No more than that.
But to be honest, I *prefer* you take time for rest  Please 
1138 2018-11-20 22:28:57 This is why we need to move to #SustainableEnergy. We're in this situation because we're hooked on oil.
1139 2018-11-20 22:28:55 I thought America was no longer dependent on Saudi for oil. Maybe he is dependent on Saudi.
1140 2018-11-20 22:28:52 A memory--when I was in Oil & Gas, I learned more from ol' Jack, than from any course. When he was in hospital & I visited, his wife of almost 50 yrs said "he was kinda cute when we met, but boy, I could listen to him talk for hours. I still think that's sexy". How cool is that?

1142 2018-11-20 22:28:47 U.S.-intl #airline traffic also was off in months just after Gulf War; I flew Houston to Europe for vacation in late May/June 1991 because it same price as Houston to NYC. Americans still spooked. But Trump identifies high #oil prices w/loser presidencies (example: Carter).

1144 2018-11-20 22:28:42 Low heat, use a cucharón to slowly move oil on top of the egg as it’s frying so that the yolk gets just a little firm this prevents the yolk from popping when you flip. When the white gets to the consistency you like flip it for a few seconds and done.
1145 2018-11-20 22:28:38 Ya know what...I would walk if Khashoggi could be brought back. FU$& their oil!!
1146 2018-11-20 22:28:35 Go Pro lenses-Drone optics--all need regular #opticalcleaning to maintain pristine conditions for optimum imaging. Nothing better than #ROR to do the job-- the only Residual Oil Remover that gets that grimy residue off lens surfaces--the difference is "CLEAR"!!!
1147 2018-11-20 22:28:24 More proof Republicans are a bunch of damn crooks no one wants there snake oil but they cheat
1148 2018-11-20 22:28:14 All things to do with war are a sop to the already cash-bloated military-industrial-government complex. It is THEY who will be fine with a cold war with China. a Trump-Geller-Bannon war with Iran. Oil and autos stay safe in their ken. Warming? Who cares. Secrets are US.
1149 2018-11-20 22:28:10 Palm oil
1150 2018-11-20 22:28:02 Lol. Oya bring your feet. I have oil somewhere
1151 2018-11-20 22:28:01 @POTUS US oil has crashed
1152 2018-11-20 22:28:01 RUB/CNY contracts already exist between Russia and China. Also CNY for China-Iran. CNY denominated oil fut launched on Shanghai exchange. While I agree with you, Pax Americana already ended in 2001. This is a natural decline.

Dear Iceland while I commend you for your Xmas ad about the Horrors of palm oil which has meant my darling boy is point blank refusing to eat choclate with palm oil in now. Why is it the only chocolate advent calender you sell without palm oil in it is the Baileys

1161 2018-11-20 22:27:23 Gotta keep the Crown Prince in power because he doesn't want oil prices going up with an election in the future.
1162 2018-11-20 22:27:23 We get most of our oil from other sources. Stop covering for you and Jared's own business interest. @realDonaldTrump #beverlyhillbilliesinthewhitehouse
1163 2018-11-20 22:27:20 Cartel das distribuidoras e dos donos de postos. Abre o mercado, desburocratiza e deixa novos players entrarem para ver. Aqui no Canadá oil cai no dia seguinte ou 2 dias depois já vê na bomba!
1164 2018-11-20 22:27:20 Scotland cannot leave the UK without paying England, Wales and N Ireland a 39BN divorce bill and signing an agreement never to build a hard border. Also the UK should still have access to Scottish fishing waters and any oil/gas they have.
1165 2018-11-20 22:27:19 The number one reason I change my own oil is because the guys at the place always try to get me to pay for some shit that I dont need because I'm a girl and this time was no damn different, shits annoying
1166 2018-11-20 22:27:10 Bahahahahaha what a simpleton pussy. Of course it’s for a defense contract and oil genius! How about “we” the American people think that’s more important than another douche bag fake news journalist that are now more irrelevant than phone booths.
1167 2018-11-20 22:27:07 Zinke was in charge of it. What he did was illegal sid deals for big oil with @OrrinHatch WE need Hatch, Zinke investigated for criminal activity and criminally responsible for CA fires. @FBIWFO @FBISanFrancisco @AGBecerra @RepMaxineWaters @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler
1168 2018-11-20 22:26:58 I think it's a question of these courts making direct rulings challenging the constitutionality of laws or EO,s. In the past this didnt seem to be the case. Constitutionality of law was assumed. Decisions were appealed to Scotus for determination.
1169 2018-11-20 22:26:54 what the fuck is emu oil
1170 2018-11-20 22:26:43 See also gluten free olive oil.
1171 2018-11-20 22:26:42 Hang in there. Let the haters do their thing. How many of THEM were brave enough to run for office? Do your research. Burn a lot of lamp oil and READ everything you can get your hands on about the federal government, writing bills, etc. AND LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS.
1172 2018-11-20 22:26:39 Khashoggi is the sacrificial lamb for cheap oil prices.
1173 2018-11-20 22:26:34 Of course nothing is cruelty free, there will always be exploitation when it comes to the mass consumption of food, the op was just saying that the meat industry causes much more damage to the rainforest than palm oil.
1174 2018-11-20 22:26:34 EZ shares -1.4%, US shares -1.8% with oil drop weighing on energy shares. Almost back to Oct lows.
US 10 yr yld flat at 3.06%.
Oil -6.7% to $53., gold -0.2%, iron ore -2.7% to $70.7.
ASX futures -1.1%.
$A 0.7211 as $US index +0.5%.
1175 2018-11-20 22:26:32 Worse than than that.. Could destabilize the dollar and crash economy. One of the biggest reasons US has such economic power is because Saudis agree to quote oil market in US $.
1176 2018-11-20 22:26:26 @CNBCFastMoney thank you @GuyAdami for calling it what it is. USA turning blind eye to the torture and murder of many that don’t stay in-line the iron fist of Saudi Royal family for oil. Cheap oil no matter how many barrels of blood that come with it
1177 2018-11-20 22:26:23 I was building Sullom Voe to bring the oil ashore .
We were solemnly informed it might last 10yr.
40yrs on still going strong, 30-50yrs predicted, and more being found all the time.
Ever feel you've been conned ?
1178 2018-11-20 22:26:23 Here is a look at the factors behind oil’s decline in world markets.
1179 2018-11-20 22:26:22 Trump & Saudi Arabia. I’ll gladly pay more for oil if that means holding them accountable
1180 2018-11-20 22:26:19 thank you heather
1181 2018-11-20 22:26:16 You just want 20 dollars a gallon gas and diesel As opec will just cut off oil like they did in the 70s . All to shove electric cars and to double your electric bill . That's the true motivation
1182 2018-11-20 22:26:14 Yeah... The elites of Saudi Arabia, truly control our stupid politicians. They buy US weapons for $500 Billion+. Than using them to kill innocent civilians in Yemen. Than blame Iran, to start a war, than steal the oil.
1183 2018-11-20 22:26:08 Here is a thought how about we become less dependent on oil for our energy and fuel. If only there were other options
1184 2018-11-20 22:26:08 Full cycle cost recovery time. On land economics do are not supported by basin sizes, so need to go off-shore or Oil sands. But, when some git is willing to blow their brains out on un-economic shale production, prices will never justify such long-lead cost recovery. Join 'em.
1185 2018-11-20 22:25:56 You can look directly at it or away. One thing remains the middle east is going to do what it wants as long as there is a need for oil...unhook the umbilical cord so I know its real
1186 2018-11-20 22:25:44 Seth is a charlatan sellig you snake oil in the form of a book .   You all hate trump and that’s your right . But to criminalize political differences is very dangerous to all of us.
1187 2018-11-20 22:25:44 Hot oil to cook the roast potatoes!!
1188 2018-11-20 22:25:40 Actually it is who we are. We let ten thousand die in Yemen from SA. How many killed in Iraq? We overthrew Iran . All for oil. It's America welcome to reality

1190 2018-11-20 22:25:35 Hi Scott. Used cooking oil would go in the grey bin. You can use food waste bags to keep this together. You can pick these up from your nearest recycling centre. Thanks.
1191 2018-11-20 22:25:29 How many millions have you made? And what investments do you have? Any drug stocks that do animal testing? Or oil stocks dont say oh my accountant handles that let's see your portfolio and tax returns I'll bet your full of it little preaching hippocrate hollwood perverts maga
1192 2018-11-20 22:25:26 It might be more simple like keep pumping oil to keep prices down. Short term gain.  Trading Khashoggi for some oil.  Keeping each other’s back.

1194 2018-11-20 22:25:20 if one looked  at  history  of  Iran..they  were already  testing  democracy in  1953..they  elected  a  Prime  Minister  but bec he  was  going to make  their  oil public..  Churchill got involved.. wanting  to  topple  this  PM..  Truman  turned him down  but  Eisenhower  ageed
1195 2018-11-20 22:25:13 We could keep our oil in the ground. It won't go anywhere. It would still be there if we needed it later.
A vigorous energy mix is best.
1196 2018-11-20 22:25:04 支援～！
1197 2018-11-20 22:25:04 Es un lugar para hacer un pulmón para la ciudad , pero estos ladrones hicieron negocio para ellos . Los vecinos que se jodan , respiren gas oil !! La ignorancia de estos corruptos .
1198 2018-11-20 22:24:52 para may mapagmalaking coconut oil hehe
1199 2018-11-20 22:24:45 @starljones  is your read big money "companies" are freaking out causing the stock market and oil to go down.
1200 2018-11-20 22:24:44 If Trump doesn't take action against SA, I'm fine with it. I live in the Northeast & heating oil is 3.60 gallon, don't want it going to over 6.00 gallon as Trump indicated- just keep SA happy. Deep freeze last winter lasted for 3 weeks & oil jumped to $4.65 gallon, 1000 gal tank.
1201 2018-11-20 22:24:44 What will it take before his fanatics really see what's going on and understand what a snake oil salesman he's been for the last 2 years? Will the ever admit that this man is pure evil?
1202 2018-11-20 22:24:40 There's a sense of the Central Belt equates to the SE of England re distribution of wealth which is crazy. Aberdeen saw massive income from oil but has little to show for it. Bad local government imho.
1203 2018-11-20 22:24:34 Scotland holds...
The oil
The fish 
The whisky
The renewable energy 
Any obstruction by our new neighbours would hurt them as much if not more so than us. And we’d have the EU behind us. 
Please stop spouting nonsense.
1204 2018-11-20 22:24:23 like I’m so salty I spent $70 on a oil change and an air filter replacement, now my window on some goofy shit lol
1205 2018-11-20 22:24:21 I'm not a Brahmin. 4 of my cousins are employed in the US. Most Americans are so ignorant about any culture that isn't theirs, that I doubt if they're burning the midnight oil mugging up caste hierarchy for prospective Indian employees. You're talking out of your ass, lady.
1206 2018-11-20 22:24:18 Yo mama so fat when she breaks a sweat OPEC has a new oil surplus. Lol
1207 2018-11-20 22:24:15 The CNBC tv traders were even pushing oil stocks after the crude runup to $90!! THAT CALL WAS SO LATE! You NEVER jump on AFTER massive runups! THEIR OIL STOCK PICKS HAVE NOW BEEN CRUSHED. & Despite Pres Trump calling for more drilling/production around the globe & here in US!!!
1208 2018-11-20 22:24:03 Oil change ,air filter ,tire rotation  I might just start leasing cars smh....

1210 2018-11-20 22:24:02 Who got the good oil based body butters and doing a black Friday sale?
1211 2018-11-20 22:23:59 Tech and oil are sensitive and their bounce back may be more flexible
1212 2018-11-20 22:23:56 Trump just gave Saudi Arabia the okay to kill Americans. As long as they give us cheap oil & he can keep his business ties, we’ll tolerate their murders. Money over morals, like usual with Trump...
1213 2018-11-20 22:23:53 @realDonaldTrump You are a fool for letting the Saudi Arabian snakeheads go so they will keep oil prices low. I will not vote for you. You are the scum of the earth. You will lose and America will fall into the hands of the socialists and villains of the universe.
1214 2018-11-20 22:23:48 Ah but a REAL Caesar salad:

- delicious olive oil
- some sort of delicious healthy italian green thing
- PARMEGGIANO!
- EGGS!
- A touch of anchovy!
- A splash of Worcestershire sauce!

You need a new chef.
1215 2018-11-20 22:23:39 i wanna say rosemary and plentiful olive oil but i can't make any promises

1217 2018-11-20 22:23:28 Highly recommend CBDPure they offer both oil and the capsules and by far ours and our fans favourite. Any questions then do let us know
1218 2018-11-20 22:23:23 It's fine to blatantly murder a US citizen because... low oil prices! You know, the thing that also contributes to our future destruction
1219 2018-11-20 22:23:21 Musing: What if Tehran made Trump an offer he couldn't refuse? Say, a few billion to pay for some Trump hotels and golf courses, plus maybe a seaside resort or two? Plus, Iran itself's no slouch in the oil production department. Let your imagination run wild! 
1220 2018-11-20 22:23:21 The surplus was predicated on oil selling at a much higher price.
1221 2018-11-20 22:23:17 So @chigrl  walking around the city listening to tons of macro podcasts the one thing that really jumps out at me is that the end of Pax Americana will happen when CNY or EUR denominated oil contract takes off. The you can kiss the dollar standard goodbye. Until then we rule
1222 2018-11-20 22:22:55 instead of spending billions $$ protecting Saudi Arabia we should get this money into making electric cars more affordable so we don’t need oil from The Middle East
1223 2018-11-20 22:22:55 紅白ゲスト出場でAqoursが出てきてる
1224 2018-11-20 22:22:52 he doesn’t you know we have an agreement with the Saudi’s they sell their oil Only in US dollars. If they stop All those dollars come back and they will be worth less in value
1225 2018-11-20 22:22:48 It's a brand of cooking oil. That's what Eddies drinking!
1226 2018-11-20 22:22:47 America will be completely energy sufficient in less then 2 years.  we now longer need the oil.  just saying
1227 2018-11-20 22:22:47 Talk to me about CBD oil... will it cure my acne and my neck inflammation....
1228 2018-11-20 22:22:45 Yes

Noble got the oil rights.  Now Papa wants to sell the pipeline part
1229 2018-11-20 22:22:45 No- the time is now to sell oil.
1230 2018-11-20 22:22:35 Economically, no. $450 billion + friendly terms on country with endless oil reserves > one non-citizen killed somewhere else.
1231 2018-11-20 22:22:30 Wow. Oil will do that to ya. Brutal #impeachtrumpasap
1232 2018-11-20 22:22:29 the oil barons will be put on suicide watch which is unfortunate
1233 2018-11-20 22:22:26 If we have sex for 4 hours we gonna need to head to autozone to get an oil change on that 
1234 2018-11-20 22:22:20 Trump is keeping oil prices down?? Seriously?? In which country?

1235 2018-11-20 22:22:20 Despite all the oil we now know we have, we should still be moving towards renewables. The sun isn't going anywhere. Enhanced solar cells!
1236 2018-11-20 22:22:10 Not for money. Not for oil!
1237 2018-11-20 22:22:03 Don’t you find it completely moronic that eastern Canada buys Saudi oil thereby helping finance all of the atrocities they commit and then provide humanitarian support to those countries that are the victims of the saudis atrocities?
1238 2018-11-20 22:22:01 Mr. Pompeo is just another bootlicker for the Liar-in-Chief. He, like his boss, has sold out America's honor for Saudi gold and Saudi oil. He knows, his boss knows, Prince Salman is responsible for Kashoggi's murder. Shame on them both.
1239 2018-11-20 22:21:59 If we allow the Saudi prince to kill an American journalist because we want to keep buying cheap oil and selling them weapons to kill more journalists-where is the line? We’re past the line. Did Saudi terrorists have OUR country’s best interest in mind on September 11 2001?

1252 2018-11-20 22:21:04 I'll use some of this horse hair oil to smooth my locks.
1253 2018-11-20 22:21:02 My family puts olive oil on literally everything... I mean everything
1254 2018-11-20 22:20:54 Since the United States has oil reserves, why are we buying from anyone? 
And we know that Trump's have trouble with numbers, his insistence that the Saudis are spending $ for US arms is most likely false.
Morals should not be for sale!
1255 2018-11-20 22:20:42 And OPEC is Ottoman Oil and Hopefully We Do not take Your Nickel Now I Told you at time and Hope For This and with such stupid behaviour Ottoman Do So

So so in love with it 
1257 2018-11-20 22:20:22 Who got some oil
1258 2018-11-20 22:20:16 Trump says he like lower oil prices...
And the oil goes down.
1259 2018-11-20 22:20:07 For your paintings, do you use oil, acrylic, or your own jizz from your spanking it to the president?
1260 2018-11-20 22:19:59 Guys tonightMy team is doing a CBD oil giveaway! who wants a invite comment your favorite holiday movie below 
1261 2018-11-20 22:19:53 Oil Change
1262 2018-11-20 22:19:52 I change my oil myself, I dont let those idiots do it for me.
1263 2018-11-20 22:19:51 Lol
Not gonna destroy oul prices
Puts sanctions on iran
Suddenly oil prices up by 50%
Cost of living skyrockets
Trumps rich mates profit on stock market
1264 2018-11-20 22:19:50 Interesting that it appears Nationalism seems to be backed by Corporate globalism! Oil, Coal, NRA, Big Pharma, etc. also how interesting the post was deleted. Glad you tweeted that picture
1265 2018-11-20 22:19:40 Not for long term use but definitely drink it 3-4 times a week. I have some myself and the essential oil I use in my waters and coffee
1266 2018-11-20 22:19:30 So we just got to deal with these lunatics. In an ideal world, the major economic powers wouldn't need Saudi Arabia and tell them to buzz off. But world runs on petroleum. 

Luckily, due to the oil and fracking boom in America, USA is not as dependent on Saud oil as in the past
1267 2018-11-20 22:19:24 It is my understanding that we are now carbon-self-sufficient: we don't need Saudi oil, anyway. Lawdy, he's so predictable and a caricature of a human being!
1268 2018-11-20 22:19:18 Someone just shared another product with me...
look at all the "crap" in their oil vs our's. This is why we LOVE to educate people so they don't get ripped off. 
1269 2018-11-20 22:19:13 -Billion-dolar arms deal between US and Saudi with approx 17k jobs with it.  
-Oil business 
-Federal reserves
-Middle east politics (Countering Iran)
How can US afford to mess up with these issues only b'se of one Arab killed by Arabs?
1270 2018-11-20 22:19:03 Tea tree oil. If not then exfoliate, cleanse and moisturizer twice as much

1273 2018-11-20 22:18:56 Are you using the olivCEPT when makin your oil?
1274 2018-11-20 22:18:47 And your suggestion would be? Destabilize the Middle East, sky rocket the global price of oil ,crumbling industries. What happened was wrong but measures must be restricted. Last time the world went all out over 1 man we ended up with ww1
1275 2018-11-20 22:18:45 so if oil prices are  in great shape 

its ok to hack up a journalist
1276 2018-11-20 22:18:45 I forget that I can throw cut up vegetables into to the oven with salt pepper and olive oil. The easiest and cheapest thing to cook. and also forget...
1277 2018-11-20 22:18:42 There is a bigger story here. The reason why democrats/socialists/leftists who work in the media want to pillory Saudia Arabia?? By doing so these self same people have to know that Saudai Arabia would would return the favor back to America?? We do run on oil right??
1278 2018-11-20 22:18:39 "Big ethanol" is a term invented by oil lobbyists Ernest. Take a look at the net income of even the biggest ethanol player ADM. At $1.6 billion in 2017 it is dwarfed by integrated oil and gas companies like Chevron. The @EthanolRFA member base is primarily independent producers.
1279 2018-11-20 22:18:29 Trump said he has kept oil prices down...  this insanity is endless.
1280 2018-11-20 22:18:28 Market watch:

Canada's main stock index sustained a triple-digit decline as a big drop in oil prices pushed the TSX down by 194 points. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 552 points or 2.2%.
1281 2018-11-20 22:18:28 I want some yucca fries with garlic oil so badly
1282 2018-11-20 22:18:22 what kind of oil do you use? i find olive doesn't stand up to high heat. i usually just put in a tiny bit to coat the pan.
1283 2018-11-20 22:18:21 But hydrogenation and corn syrup are so usefullllll.

For real tho hydrogenated oil is not good for your dad's arteries
1284 2018-11-20 22:18:19 Is that really a serious question? The Saudis have shit loads of money... the banned countries have none left because they have either been bombed back to the Middle Ages or have no money because they never got out of the Middle Ages in the first place!!! ( for money, read oil)
1285 2018-11-20 22:18:04 I was pissed yesterday because they gave me fries they pulled out of the oil about 45 seconds too early. 
1286 2018-11-20 22:18:02 The shah of Iran was forced to accept Israel despite his reluctance.  The same colonizing forces in play today: British, US, Israel used Saudi oil in 1976 to freeze Iran out of oil market & forced Savak to jail communists while Mossad radicalized them into revolutionary Islamists

1288 2018-11-20 22:17:56 @WESH just saw a special report on deep frying turkeys and Dave actually gave incorrect directions. He stated to mark the amount of oil by using water. Problem is, when oil gets hot, it expands, so this method would STILL overflow and cause a fire.
1289 2018-11-20 22:17:36 Bit of beard oil and wax and you'll look grand.
1290 2018-11-20 22:17:35 I would really appreciate if every single time I went in to get an oil change they didn’t try to rip me off just because I’m a girl
1291 2018-11-20 22:17:33 The irony is we don’t need to use as much as 70% of oil. Green tech in Germany offsets that much today. I agree we can burn some fossil fuels. But let’s all agree breathing air that can kill you is bad.
1292 2018-11-20 22:17:28 NOTE TO ALL MY LADIES: before going home for thanksgiving, check the oil in your car so when your dad asks you when you last checked your oil, you can sound like you actually have your life together 
1293 2018-11-20 22:17:27 We get 12% of our oil from the Middle East.
1294 2018-11-20 22:17:24 Trump’s message regarding its failure to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia is basically: human rights violations and murder don’t matter; arms sales and oil more important. How then can Trump justify sanctions against Iran and Turkey?
1295 2018-11-20 22:17:23 I have been sitting at the car dealership for almost 2 hours now...JUST FOR AN OIL CHANGE
1296 2018-11-20 22:17:21 $450 billion of investment + endless oil reserves > one non-citizen killed somewhere else. This is the correct analysis.
1297 2018-11-20 22:17:20 Take your fucking oil Geary
1298 2018-11-20 22:17:16 You make it sound as if there’s clean palm oil

1302 2018-11-20 22:16:54 Interesting fact Obama really wasn’t that into them, in fact we produced more oil under Obama than any other president and exported more than ever before and imported less and our prices were low but weirdly enough all that stopped under Trump and we’re paying outrageous prices

1305 2018-11-20 22:16:43 Agreed. Very strange time to be in oil and gas. trump was mostly elected on pro energy policies
1306 2018-11-20 22:16:18 Well, we've given free stuff for nothing in return to the oil, gas, coal and pharma companies for years.
1307 2018-11-20 22:15:50 I don’t see this as an issue of morality I see this as a motivated narrative got debunked hard in the public eye, 1 they have pushed in uniformity, corporations only signal morality when backed into inconvenient corners. Caping for oil tycoons backfired = new narrative scrambling
1308 2018-11-20 22:15:49 How about stick to talking about the leafs and enjoy thier little bit of success and just stop even mentioning the Oilers. Your insight is unwanted. Oh and by the way, how many cups have the leafs win in your lifetime?? The Oil have won 5 in mine
1309 2018-11-20 22:15:38 This more of this! Time to take responsibility for your actions, too easy to believe the liars, the racists, the dog whistle snake oil salesmen, the people who broke the law.
1310 2018-11-20 22:15:37 The Saudis have us by the gnads. We aren't oil independent and we count on their oil sales that are traded in US dollars.

Until oil reserves are depleted, we will have no leverage over Saudi Arabia.

Prince MBS is a problem but comrade Trump won't be the one to challenge him.
1311 2018-11-20 22:15:36 Oil down a massive 7% today as President Trump makes it clear he's standing with our ally Saudi Arabia...the impact on investments and business is coming up next...stay with us!
1312 2018-11-20 22:15:26 ALERTSF: The oil spill on Howard & 12th Streets has been cleared. The streets are reopened to traffic.
1313 2018-11-20 22:15:26 .
There's surely a middle ground to be reached that does NOT include ceding billions in arms purchases to our worse adversaries, RU and CH, and seeing oil over $100 bl to enrich them, too.  A new new world order hangs in balance.  Khashoggi should not be a Franz Ferdinand martyr!
1314 2018-11-20 22:15:15 The chance for America to distance its self from SA has passed. We all know the world is dictated by oil and our energy consumption. The elephant in the room is us. Until human breeding is not questioned we’ll screw everything 
1315 2018-11-20 22:15:11 (Oil ....lots of oil)
1316 2018-11-20 22:15:10 Is blue points an omega 3 fish oil?
1317 2018-11-20 22:15:08 Ya just like all those huge tax breaks we give car and oil company’s.
1318 2018-11-20 22:15:04  same i was complaining yesterday about my back but my friend mom gave me like this essential oil thing and it was all natural and it was like a miracle i didn’t have no more pain

1321 2018-11-20 22:14:51 As I shopped in Iceland for the 2nd time in ma life I congratulated them on the palm oil decision then I goat tae the cheese...it had a Jack n was put back.
1322 2018-11-20 22:14:48 Yes, we are addicted to the Saudi oil. However, they are addicted to the money it brings to support their lifestyle and government projects. The House of Saud needs $80/per barrel to stay in power.
1323 2018-11-20 22:14:39 So we should forfeit 100’s of Billions worth of US jobs and production so the Saudi’s can just purchase elsewhere? Or we can continue hammering their economy in the oil market to force a stand down in Yemen and keep taking their $$ for weapons they’ll get anyway, with or w/o us.
1324 2018-11-20 22:14:38 Trump on Saudi Arabia « We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars of orders. » He predicted that if he did « I think the oil prices would go through the roof » (Via pool)
1325 2018-11-20 22:14:28 Saudi Arabia:
Security co-operation = Not funding anymore major terror attacks for a while
Economic co-operation = Not holding the world to ransom on oil prices
Trade = buying US weapons at inflated prices to kill civilians
Trump = bought and paid for puppet #KashoggiMurder
1326 2018-11-20 22:14:26 Once upon a time, the U.S. needed Saudi oil. No longer. Our imports of Saudi oil are the lowest they've been in 30 years. The U.S. has the leverage to punish the kingdom for killing an American-based journalist. If Trump demanded the ouster of MBS, the prince would be toast.
1327 2018-11-20 22:14:17 oil on canvas: "Another type of rain in the mind percepts of objects formerly given in sense perception" (Another Crap Art TM 2016)
1328 2018-11-20 22:14:12 This guy TRUMP is nothing more then a HUSTLER..  he knows the USA does need Saudi Arabia for oil.  But Trump does.  Years ago TRUMP'S  investment (before Presidency) into the oil industry started with Saudi & MIDDLE Eastern oil markets when he was in NYC.
1329 2018-11-20 22:14:08 According to his latest statement "breaking with the Saudis will lead us to higher oil prices. And I want to keep them low"
Ignoring the killing of a Journalist will give us $1.50 per gallon of gas.
Sacrifice an American resident to keep the dream of a Trump tower in Riyadh.
1330 2018-11-20 22:14:02 I hope @realDonaldTrump is making a good decision siding w/ Saudi Arabia. I hope it's not just for oil.
Even though low gas prices would be great for us!!!!!

1331 2018-11-20 22:14:01 What about the olive oil black market
1332 2018-11-20 22:14:00 E isso tudo ainda ocorreu em um periodo sazonal de menor demanda por oil, entre o driving season e heating season americano !
1333 2018-11-20 22:14:00 I’ve been waiting over an hour for my oil change & I just wanna go home & go to bed. 
1334 2018-11-20 22:13:55 Each UN org works on own to balloon dollar needs and beg (now demand) for West's funding; some led by ideally socialist bureaucrats. 
e.g.
UNEP IPCC UNFCCC UNCHS UNDP FAO WHO UNforRefugees... self-declared world saviors.
Recall Maurice Strong, UNEP Chief, “Oil For Food Scandal.”
1335 2018-11-20 22:13:40 Apparently we don't reduce cation emissions because of racism and mommy issues? Wow. I thought it was because of our short sighted, financial entanglements with the oil industry.
1336 2018-11-20 22:13:33 It is all about the money & oil. @realDonaldTrump just bent over and told the #SaudiArabia it's okay I don't believe in #HumanRights either, murder any journalist you want. When Trump gets arrested do we get to cut his hands off for stealing, since he likes #ShariaLaw so much
1337 2018-11-20 22:13:20 Seems to be a trend there. Federal money goes into company, company gets bigger, company keeps getting richer then Monopoly.. It happened with Standard Oil, AT&T, now Tech.
1338 2018-11-20 22:13:06 เรียลมากกกกกก
1339 2018-11-20 22:13:05 .@realDonaldTrump acts like we need #SaudiArabia oil. In May 2011, we, the U.S. became a net exporter of refined petro products. As of 2014, the U.S. was the world's 3rd-largest producer of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia and Russia. And demand has been decreasing #incompetent

Maybe focus on getting our nation's integrity back in this situation rather than continuing to allow it to be traded for money, oil, or some regional strategy?
1355 2018-11-20 22:12:06 If you don't understand why NO president will cut ties with Saudi Arabia, please research the petrodollar & other Saudi economic leverage over the US as well as US oil dependence.
Why would anyone be surprised a govt that beheads its citizens would also murder a dissident?
1356 2018-11-20 22:12:03 Thinking of Napa: up this creative Italian extra special "Thank You" iced cookies, Pirouline dark chocolate truffles, sea salt olive oil
1357 2018-11-20 22:11:53 I use the derma-e cleansing oil, but literally even olive oil is better for melting off the makeup than wipes are to remove it. The derma-e is $15, but at Ulta it’s buy one get one 40% off if that helps
1358 2018-11-20 22:11:50 Acredito que veremos redução tanto no investimento quanto produção de shale a frente. 

Em resumo, acho que o Trump enganou os Sauditas, passou a perna em todo mundo e "cancelou" as sanções do Iran exatamente quandi todos estavam produzindo mais oil.
1359 2018-11-20 22:11:47 If you're anti pipeline then park your car, even if its electric, give away your phone and your computer make your own clothes and live your principles. I will offer you mad props for that. World demand for oil is not stoppingor dropping and we buy Saudi oil. Makes no sense.

Trump is write, you are Wrong. Don't create a problem on Oil, Terrorism, Job and Economy.
1366 2018-11-20 22:11:13 I hear engraved Gold Bone Saws are the favored WH Xmas grift this season.
Well I suppose we can be hopeful that only 15 (not counting MBS) State-sponsored Saudis attacked this time, down from 19 on 9/11.
But the world economy at risk?
The US exports huge volumes of oil.
MORE LIES
1367 2018-11-20 22:11:12 If you think bath boobs are cool, wait until you throw a frozen turkey into a vat of hot oil.
1368 2018-11-20 22:11:09 Yes and oil. Big oil relies on plastic for some of their profit.

1372 2018-11-20 22:10:52 I hit a bump a real hard on my car and it cracked my oil pan had to replace it Monday.
1373 2018-11-20 22:10:45 #Trump about his #Khashoggi decision: "US will not ruin world economy by taking tough stance on #SaudiArabia".  Me: What an idiotic remark. #Saudis would not oil boycott the #US but countries who take measures Trump refuses to take
1374 2018-11-20 22:10:41 That's a really silly statement Jordan.
Does Jim Acosta control oil prices and potential to destabilize the USD?
1375 2018-11-20 22:10:37 The Shah was NOT A BRUTAL DICTATOR. He was chosen to rule after his father was ousted by British due to his young age. He & Mossadegh were both in favor of nationalizing oil. He was forced out of country by British threatening his life until they ousted Mossadegh.
1376 2018-11-20 22:10:37 Yes, this is what I mostly like. I realise oil is still important but would love to get weaned off it as a matter of urgency. Hydrogen cells not only for transport but for homes, too, is what I would love to see.
1377 2018-11-20 22:10:28 Keep me updated too. I miss "oil can"
1378 2018-11-20 22:10:28 Iran has oil too.

I think the U.S bromance with Saudi goes beyond oil.
1379 2018-11-20 22:10:20 Country music, back roads, and the smell of oil will always make me miss my papa
1380 2018-11-20 22:10:17 But Saudi Arabia is only 10% of imports...and net imports are only 19% of daily consumption.

Oil matters. But it doesn’t excuse murder. They don’t have the hand you claim they do. They rely on us much more than we do them.
1381 2018-11-20 22:10:17 I need a oil change ..
1382 2018-11-20 22:10:15 Stop selling us oil.
1383 2018-11-20 22:10:12 So basically as long as Saudi Arabia is buying weapons from the US and selling oil to the US (oil that we don’t need btw) Trump is fine w/ any atrocity or human rights violations from MBS

Well, it was a nice 2 weeks off 
Time to start organizing again
Vote in 2020

1388 2018-11-20 22:10:04 Caesar salad is probably the biggest health food farce.

It's entirely:
- Vegetable oil (or worse, soybean)
- Lettuce (very little nutrition)
- Cheese (the only good part)
1389 2018-11-20 22:10:03 If indeed all the evidence shows that the Crown Prince ordered the assassination, then we need to do as senator Paul suggests.

In addition though, we could also take this as an opportunity to become energy independent from Saudi Arabia. We don't need their oil.
1390 2018-11-20 22:10:03 Endless oil story
1391 2018-11-20 22:09:58 You have done far worse. You have pardoned the Saudi Crown Prince for Saudi silver. You have sold America's honor for Saudi oil. May God forgive you.
1392 2018-11-20 22:09:58 This president has no morals at all everything is down to oil and money for him.

1403 2018-11-20 22:09:09 Hahaha I’m glad you think so! Just gets more relevant as people are aware about palm oil etc!

1405 2018-11-20 22:09:02 Ughh. Honestly I’d rather have the Oil bring in a new, unproven coach rather than offense killing Hitchcock. Although wins are the only thing that matter so if the team wins with him then it’s the right move.
1406 2018-11-20 22:08:59 ahbi they used oil instead of butter
1407 2018-11-20 22:08:58 Money and oil... naive!
1408 2018-11-20 22:08:55 We ALL know he did it and got away with it because he CAN and did!!  He knows his lover 45 needs them for oil and his golf course!!!
1409 2018-11-20 22:08:47 Why would Trump and/or the US do anything Saudi Arabia is a soverign nation and it holds a large percentage of the worlds oil reserves if they were to sanction it or declare war there would be major crisises ir maybe even more wars for other oil reserves
1410 2018-11-20 22:08:45 No US citizen is now safe Trump has effectively rubber stamped  the execution of any US citizen for any reason by any country with oil
1411 2018-11-20 22:08:42 “I WOULD INFLATE AN INFLATABLE POOL, FILL IT UP WITH SYRUP, GET BUTT NAKED, AND OIL MYSELF! WELCOME TO MY LIFE!”
1412 2018-11-20 22:08:34 Nothing surprising there. The yanks need the money from arms sales to Saudi Arabia too much and the world needs their oil way too much for any serious sanctions to be put in place
1413 2018-11-20 22:08:30 Stop putting olive oil in your pasta water! It makes the sauce slide ride off your lovely pasta! Super salt your water and just stir that motherfucker occasionally and nothing should stick. Also finish all sauces with a splash of pasta water and a Lil butter. This has been a psa.
1414 2018-11-20 22:08:28 Hmm i think this convo around Trump and Saudi Arabia is weird. "What do they have on him??". Maybe it's just all the oil they have and the fact that they're a major ally and we make billions off them in weapons sales yearly
1415 2018-11-20 22:08:13 But at least I know how to check my oil and how to fill it up now 
1416 2018-11-20 22:08:12 Never ever give any government power to regulate oil production!
Once you give them that power it will never be rescinded and will be abused for partisan gain earlier then later.
The "temporary income taxes" to pay for world war 1 ought to be a lesson never to be forgotten.
1417 2018-11-20 22:08:10 If Sean Hannity "shit oil on to a canvas"
1418 2018-11-20 22:08:07 Blamming palm oil has been an endless stories crafted by developed countries which massive deforestation and carbon emission were their covered history.

Simply there is no other better vegetable oil commodities in achieving progressive productivity within the same piece of land.
1419 2018-11-20 22:08:05 I’ve realised I need to start wearing gloves in the gym again. Decided to use castor oil tonight and it didn’t feel so smooth 
1420 2018-11-20 22:08:03 Spot on. Oil production is dependant on oil price. There isn't anybody besides arabic which have technical capability to continue oil production below 40$. Arabic states are far less burdened in trouble times. Low price today = less extraction in future. oil is long term project.
1421 2018-11-20 22:08:02 The main trick for stir fry is high heat and quick cooking. Which is why using an Instapot to make it is stupid. Flash fry protein in oil on high in a hot pan/wok, remove. Give veggies a flash fry, toss back in protein, add sauce. Toss a few times until incorporated. Done.
1422 2018-11-20 22:07:53 Please explain regarding oil prices.
1423 2018-11-20 22:07:49 For the sake of dollar and oil, there are already sanctions on Iran.
1424 2018-11-20 22:07:48 My brother, you need not blow this trumpet too hard. For those who can research, let them look into the files of venezuala, with such a bountiful wealth profile, the largest oil reserve in the 
World but poorer that Mauritania, because of corruption. PMB and intergrity is key.
1425 2018-11-20 22:07:44 The thing is, it's not really because of the oil price gap. It's because of the $90M that has been spent by foreign interest groups (extensively documented by @FairQuestions) specifically and intentionally to impair Canada's oil industry. And everyone just watched in happen.
1426 2018-11-20 22:07:42 Angry TRUMP  siding with SAUDIA ARABIA. Trump lies about money says 400 billion in contracts. That is just not TRUE!

OIL will not be an issue and helpful time for GREEN TECH. 

@realDonaldTrump is NUTS!

He wanted to prosecute @HillaryClinton and @Comey scary

Time to #DumpTrump
1427 2018-11-20 22:07:38 The problem is that oil is a global market and Asian countries rely on Saudi oil. Take out the oil of any large exporter and prices in the pump in Boise or Atlanta are going to increase.

1429 2018-11-20 22:07:31 So the difference between Iran and Saudi Arabia is..... both have oil, both have sanctioned murder. 
But....only one’s citizens flew planes into buildings. Only one supports trumps finances. Hmmmmm.
1430 2018-11-20 22:07:29 山田家ってなんであんなにもモブ姦が似合う(※個人の意見です)のかって考えたんだけどやっぱり3人がまだ未成年ってところが大きいよね
1431 2018-11-20 22:07:26 atleast apc has an ideology unlike your party that does not know where they stand the party chairman is talking about govt control of oil price the candidate wants deregulation #confusion
1432 2018-11-20 22:07:19 Oil dependency will kill us all
1433 2018-11-20 22:07:17 I don't support Trump's position on Khashoggi's murder. If the Saudi Prince was indicted in the murder, the U.S. should be leading the charge in sanctioning Saudi Arabia like they always do to Iran. Well, OIL.
1434 2018-11-20 22:07:11 Oil! Evil big oil! Plastic is their other major money maker.
1435 2018-11-20 22:07:10 to be fair, saudi arabis has always been shit for human rights and the us has always ignored it because of he oil.
1436 2018-11-20 22:07:09 <living bottle of olive oil
1437 2018-11-20 22:07:06 Everything I’m reading says it’s either glycol or glycerine either one is now illegal in the country I’m not seeing anything about oil based antifreeze
1438 2018-11-20 22:07:06 Oil more important that human rights. #AmericaFirst
1439 2018-11-20 22:07:04 Trump knows the tricks of intelligence and knows the interest of his country more than anyone else Just imagine that Saudi Arabia decided to sell oil in a currency other than the dollar What will happen and stop investment in America and move it to China or Russia
1440 2018-11-20 22:07:03 Trump: „They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels.“

yeah right... you ask them to keep prices low and then they just do that

what? the? fuck!

who the FUCK do you think you are?!
1441 2018-11-20 22:06:57 I  had a brief look to find oil revenues for Scotland rather than UK and didn't find anything accurate. The south do appear to take and take for granted much from Scotland.
1442 2018-11-20 22:06:55 "Saudi Arabia" U.S. needs oil and weapons sales - Khashoggi who?
1443 2018-11-20 22:06:48 if your Anastasia Brow Pomade is dry as fuck - add baby oil!! it keeps it wet and when you apply, it doesn’t smell or run - eye drops only work for like a couple of days
1444 2018-11-20 22:06:46 @realDonaldTrump Listen here Sir. We only import 0.96 % of our oil from #SaudiArabia We import %40 from Canada. You already pissed in their Corn Flakes. We are American's and we hold more than money in our hearts. One of those things we hold is integrity. Do the right thing!
1445 2018-11-20 22:06:45 Allah ya karo

1447 2018-11-20 22:06:39 Why would u pick coconut oil as ur luxury item ??
1448 2018-11-20 22:06:37 Does anyone think that Saudi Arabia has helped Trump keep oil prices low? @realDonaldTrump #saudioil
1449 2018-11-20 22:06:34 And our net import rate was 19% (also from the EIA). So, that 79% isn't 79% of oil consumption...and not even solely from Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia is most independent...compared to Canada (4x more important than SA)?  You speak very strangely for a random Internet person.
1450 2018-11-20 22:06:31 For a guy who supposedly graduated from Wharton, Trump sounds like a fucking moron when he tries to talk about oil prices or interest rates or the economy.
1451 2018-11-20 22:06:30 why does RUSSIA or China need to do business with Saudi Arabia?  Nither have never had to do business with Saudi Arabia.. LITERALLY never. 
TRUMP concocted THAT story today. When in fact.. TRUMP has personal oil stock in the Saudi Arabia oil market.
1452 2018-11-20 22:06:25 Go to the beauty supply and get some Jamaican black castor oil. Get a spooly (mascara brush) and brush your brows everyday with it. It’ll grow them out nice and thick.

1455 2018-11-20 22:06:21 The conversation was nascar racing not oil pipelines. I already told you what nascar uses is literally a drop in the sea and yet they still plant trees to make up for what they use.
 They don't even use shell oil they use Sunoco.  What kind of car do you drive?
1456 2018-11-20 22:06:21 Not apparently, I've seen the archival pictures. The woman who named the buffalo was the great-great-granddaughter of Mistawasis, the chief who signed the 1876 treaty on behalf of the northern Alberta Cree. Also there was an oil rig staffed by women in gold bikinis.
1457 2018-11-20 22:06:15 I am an OIL & GAS WIFE. I thank you @realDonaldTrump for bringing our jobs back. Our family has been tremendously blessed!!!  My family thanks you Mr. @Potus for all you’ve done.
1458 2018-11-20 22:06:09 Went to buy jambons from lidl and I checked the box to find out they use “ceRtifIeD PaLm oiL”, tear came to my eye as I opened the freezer door to put them back, rip jambons
1459 2018-11-20 22:06:06 What promises made will be kept. I think that is really important. If you buy a car thinking it will do 500 miles per tank and it only does 200 might you consider you made a bad decision, because of lying snake oil salesman and charlatans.
1460 2018-11-20 22:06:03 Yep cause they need that oil
1461 2018-11-20 22:06:03 Honestly, trump first trip as president WAS to arabia, the guy loves that oil bribing.
1462 2018-11-20 22:06:01 Saudi Arabia crown Prince needs to be taking out by the USA and take to oil from them ...this man is very evil.
1463 2018-11-20 22:06:01 Sad @CBCToronto @CBCTom says Sea Rose oil spill of approx. 250K  litres is like 125K bottles of of 2L soda! Wow! great reportage
1464 2018-11-20 22:05:49 Here’s the message to Saudis
Murdering journalists is “A” OK
We love your oil
So we’ll look away
1465 2018-11-20 22:05:48 really missing the greasy street food from shanghai rn, pretty sure it was fried in rancid oil, but that just builds character.
1466 2018-11-20 22:05:47 Coconut oil, the scent of your body
1467 2018-11-20 22:05:45 Saudi Arabia rips us off on oil and was involved in 9/11. I say take Mecca and charge the muzzies admission to see their rock.
1468 2018-11-20 22:05:26 I'm sure they would prefer Scotland to be in surplus but it's all part of pooling and sharing of resources.

What's wrong with that?

Not everyone is mean & insular like Scot Nats, "It's oor oil and we don't want to share it with anybody"!
1469 2018-11-20 22:05:26 Shows just how strong the #US and @POTUS are when large amounts of money are involved.

"No problems - assassinate people, cut them up in your embassies, we don't care. Now, where do we sign for this weapons deal and oil deal?"
1470 2018-11-20 22:05:25 have sex or drink castor oil
1471 2018-11-20 22:05:18 Add it time my designer oil perfume business 
1472 2018-11-20 22:05:17 Love you lindsey, but i disagree.  My moral voice says do whats best for my family first.  Oil issues hurts us, through everything from gas to plastics.  I DO NOT CARE about a non-citizen being killed in another country.  If he was a citizen or they did it here, i'd say level KSA
1473 2018-11-20 22:05:08 Oil. The Saudis got the world by the balls.
1474 2018-11-20 22:05:06 I have to oil down first
1475 2018-11-20 22:05:02 Neem oil
1476 2018-11-20 22:05:01 Another big fall in oil price and wholesale costs. Come on supermarkets - time for another price drop #Petrol #diesel
1477 2018-11-20 22:05:01 Sure it would be oil. To a Billionaire money is everything. Not rocket science
1478 2018-11-20 22:04:52 Or gun oil
1479 2018-11-20 22:04:48 This is a diffuser and an essential oil blend. This one helps with motivation
1480 2018-11-20 22:04:46 Summary of the WH Saudi Arabia statement:

Yeah, he was brutally murdered, but the Saudis give us money and oil, so who cares.
1481 2018-11-20 22:04:43 Oil & Money > A Human Life? All life is Precious, Right? But not a precious as Oil & Money. Way to throw your Morals Out of the window!

1482 2018-11-20 22:04:35 The U.S will soon be the world's largest producer of oil. But we need to allow the Saudis to do whatever they want, to whomever they want? All because it benefits #Trump's pockets. This is unbelievable. Our nation is run by a crime boss.
1483 2018-11-20 22:04:32 Yo @KMillar15 @IntentionalTalk , gotta get some CBD oil. If that doesn't work, try something stronger!
1484 2018-11-20 22:04:26 I am not looking forward to changing oil in this weather... it’s friggin cold 
1485 2018-11-20 22:04:24 Esse waiver matou o case de descasamento de oferta x demanda e pegou o todo posicionamento spec comprado em oil, que nao era pequeno.
1486 2018-11-20 22:04:20 Very nice. Our Jiffy Lube doesn’t play much outside of golf. LOL Wish me luck for today. Tried last night, 2 hour wait. Leaving work 30 minutes early today in the hope I can beat the 5pm crowd. 15% oil left. I need to get in!!
1487 2018-11-20 22:04:15 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
1488 2018-11-20 22:04:13 There you have it.. oil and hotels trump human rights and justice. POTUS and his admin are corrupt POS and have sold their souls to the devil. And GOP is totally fine with this..
1489 2018-11-20 22:04:11 Really??? And you poured the olive oil in slow??
1490 2018-11-20 22:04:08 I just heard Trump's quote about Saudi Arabia and oil prices, and I don't think that's how oil prices work.
1491 2018-11-20 22:04:03 Would you still support a carbon tax to help pay for the polluting poison that has been pumped into our only life-sustaining dome for decades? If a company spills Oil in the Ocean, they pay for it. Should they NOT pay for it just because it is being pumped into the air?
1492 2018-11-20 22:04:00 PSA: if your going to make a road trip. Make sure you check your fluids coolant, oil, power steering, and check your tire pressure. It gives you reassurance that you’ll make it to where your going safe.
1493 2018-11-20 22:03:52 ありがとうございます！
1494 2018-11-20 22:03:46 Does the oil help a lot?  I’ve been looking into it. Not sure how to use it and heard mixed reviews. Feel better . I suffer as well.
1495 2018-11-20 22:03:44 Energy shares leading losses in the S&P 500 as #oil futures fall over 7%. BBG
1496 2018-11-20 22:03:29 シコ……
1497 2018-11-20 22:03:28 Yes this is truly from the Lord; so many of us are in need of a Spiritual make over.God wants to make us over again.He is doing a new thing. We cannot win this battle with the old stale rushed tools we utilized in the past.  He wants to equip us with fresh oil and new wineskins.
1498 2018-11-20 22:03:25 This is the evidential outcome of Communism. This country was so Oil Rich it’s a lesson on No to Communists.
1499 2018-11-20 22:03:25 Sometimes I just need the confidence to keep on adding olive oil to my mashed potatoes.
1500 2018-11-20 22:03:19 Yeah I’ve never used them. My fam usually just uses a shit ton of butter instead of oil at times
1501 2018-11-20 22:03:15 My new book is called a robot ethicist are synthesizing the same thing with free oil and gas
1502 2018-11-20 22:03:09 We have the 3rd biggest oil reserves in the world, we should not be importing any oil but that being said how much oil in your opinion can we import from Saudi before it’s unacceptable?
1503 2018-11-20 22:03:08 Put some undiluted eucalyptus oil on a cloth, keep it close to your face all night so you breath it in. Works magic for sore throats and congested sinus xx
1504 2018-11-20 22:03:07 If the former presindent did not steal so much  to give to you and his friends we would'nt be here relying to much on oil price
1505 2018-11-20 22:03:01 It's much more about the GCC and its potential than it is about oil.
1506 2018-11-20 22:02:55 We already learned that cratering oil prices are NOT, actually, good for the economy. Absolutely incredible that some have forgotten a lesson that was so obviously and clearly hammered home just 3 years ago.
1507 2018-11-20 22:02:49 So the President of the United States of America just admitted Saudi Arabia is bribing USA? Threatening to raise our oil prices
1508 2018-11-20 22:02:49 Plus oil -5% won't help margin.
1509 2018-11-20 22:02:42 Once again, #Trump takes advantage of his ignorant and uneducated base by saying that our gas prices would go through the roof if we stopped buying oil from the Saudis. We only buy 9% of our oil from them! FFS! #MAGA crowd, start educating yourselves a little. He owns you.
1510 2018-11-20 22:02:37 Palm oil is not marketed as cooking oil on the shelf on supermarket but used an an ingredient for more than 50% of their food from the supermarket. These rally did regulate the industry after all but somehow it is also fuelled by the oils & fats market competitors.
1511 2018-11-20 22:02:18 Oil companies to sign me
1512 2018-11-20 22:02:13 Did you know that there’s 1,089 oil & gas rigs in the USA and over half are in the Permian Basin. Those working in OIL & GAS, REMEMBER TO THANK @realDonaldTrump for that this Thanksgiving  @POTUS @Scavino45
1513 2018-11-20 22:02:07 Not a clue what would be used in it's place but I am sure that with the substantial amount of money in the oil fund would go a long way to researching alternatives
1514 2018-11-20 22:02:07 3 hours ago US gov sanctioned 17 Iranians an couple of companies for transporting oil and gas to Syria. They know winter is coming & they want Syrian people freeze in cold! How shameless is that? Gas is for civilians, Syrian gov has enough fuel for military!
1515 2018-11-20 22:02:06 Just like the Iceland palm oil add
1516 2018-11-20 22:01:51 Yeah but for different reasons:

Me: I really feel that Clinton taking money from large corporations such as big oil, pharma, healthcare, etc. means she will return that favor and I’m not comfortable with that.

My uncle: Her and Podesta led a pedophile ring.
1517 2018-11-20 22:01:36 gotta get my oil changed and buy a tire bruh  bicycle me 
1518 2018-11-20 22:01:29 Just asking for a friend, if the Saudis didn't have oil, would they be allies?
1519 2018-11-20 22:01:29 Respectfully, no way Jose. There’s no snake oil being peddled here. Just refreshment and fellowship.
1520 2018-11-20 22:01:25 It’s not glycol, I asked that question... they told me it was “oil based antifreeze.”
1521 2018-11-20 22:01:20 Oil and the 1%
1522 2018-11-20 22:01:14 Does @itvcorrie @SairKhan use @doterra fractionated coconut oil?  It certainly looked like their bottles. Sooooo exciting!!!! 
1523 2018-11-20 22:01:12 gotta get that oil
1524 2018-11-20 22:01:10 #Trump has given "Saudi Arabia" a license to kill anybody who disagrees w/ that government. Human lives are worth more than oil and money.
1525 2018-11-20 22:01:07 Wouldn’t it help a lot if we got a fair price for our oil.
1526 2018-11-20 22:01:03 Did someone says flowers? Yes, and only at Grease Monkey every lady, every Wednesday is given a carnation and $8 off of their full service oil change. Stop by tomorrow to try out our Ladies Day Specials!

1529 2018-11-20 22:00:46 You wan drill oil well? 
1530 2018-11-20 22:00:43 Like you don’t have to hate me because I go the diet/organic/essential oil route. I don’t hate you for going the medical route. It’s really gonna be okay 
1531 2018-11-20 22:00:43 I was so pissed off by that..and when salman scolds..him he starts crying...and m noticing this very often what is face he makes..now a days..mu ko teda karke..sala kaha se joker laya he bb me..1kg to chameli ka oil dalta he sar pe..jitna wo nai chamakta uska sar chamakta he
1532 2018-11-20 22:00:36 coconut oil is the smartest thing to take into the jungle , use it on your skin, to cook, to moisturise for your hair
1533 2018-11-20 22:00:34 November 20, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1537 2018-11-20 22:00:18 Seems outside his authority to unilaterally declare a law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it.
Does highlight the perversion and misuse of Commerce Clause by Fed Gov which has been going on for last 70 yrs or so.
1538 2018-11-20 22:00:16 It's odd that you think that the discrepancy in the two stories is a symptom of the ABC's "terrible" reporting methods, as opposed to what's actually happening: In the wake of lowering oil prices, Petrol companies are increasing profits by not lowering the price of their product.
1539 2018-11-20 22:00:13 How can a service be a right? So does that mean every meal I eat at a restaurant is a right? Does that mean every time I get an oil change it should be free? Every time the kid down the block mows my yard I don’t have to pay him?
1540 2018-11-20 22:00:10 He needs that oil
1541 2018-11-20 22:00:04 Maybe it's time we, the people of America, make a different set of choices in the Middle East. Could it be that big oil has been dictating foreign policy choices and then ensuring press coverage that confirms their end game ?

1545 2018-11-20 21:59:49 最近の傾向は読めない(笑)
1546 2018-11-20 21:59:48 I agree although I wonder if reason Pres says that is because they are considered to be a major export in oil? To denounce may affect partnership in oil subsidies
1547 2018-11-20 21:59:47 sana oil may bebe
1548 2018-11-20 21:59:47 What’s a few lives compared to low oil prices?? I need gas money so I can drive to @ChipotleTweets and try and steal some food. I might even get lucky and get a few people fired for trying

1554 2018-11-20 21:58:57 I deleted it cause I hadnt 'finished' it off ?
1555 2018-11-20 21:58:51 There's traditional olive oil based or there's mayo based aioli- it's a spread that can have all different herbs or spices. So good!
1556 2018-11-20 21:58:50 Don’t try and pivot... please... do tell how little 8% of oil market share is, and how we should be fine to lose it...

1565 2018-11-20 21:57:58 PUT HUMAN LIVES OVER OIL AND MONEY. THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA IS TOXIC AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOUSANDS OF DEATHS BECAUSE OF IT.

1567 2018-11-20 21:57:56 The opposition is asking in the legislature today why coal plants and offshore oil companies in Eastern Canada are
getting exemptions from the carbon tax and not Yukon families.
1568 2018-11-20 21:57:56 I’m supposed to be studying but instead I’m reading buzzfeed articles about coconut oil and using all five of my biology books as a blanket
1569 2018-11-20 21:57:53 @theresa_may oil plummets to new 13 month low... Interesting how the pumps don't reflect that..

RIP OF BRITAIN STRIKES AGAIN.

DISGRACE.
1570 2018-11-20 21:57:51 I went to get my oil changed like a responsible car owner before my dad has a chance to tell me to go get one when I visit this weekend 
1571 2018-11-20 21:57:47 when are going to stop the #north sea oil and give people really #ClimateJustice ? Am sorry your focus is hypocritical and will never lead to a just transition to a green economy
1572 2018-11-20 21:57:45 Is the economy doing well? What are the FDI in non oil sector? What about our stocks? 

Dont come here and be forming some pseudo intellectual you are foolish and i wont waste my time on enemies of my nation who only praise FG and avoid constructive criticism
1573 2018-11-20 21:57:35 I doubt they would laugh if wind turbines showed up in their neck of the woods. CA stopped oil rigs off CA because of the look. Not what the Malibu elites wanted to see in their ocean.
1574 2018-11-20 21:57:31  probably.

It's just so weird. I found the oil painting first listed in about 2010, and it had been going for a couple of years then already.

Then the other painting turned up, and then the others.

The drawing with the tea lights is new, though.
1575 2018-11-20 21:57:30 Prof. Io di questi tempi investo sempre in Boost Wti Oil 3x Leverage Daily. Ogni anno mi faccio un reddito di cittadinanza.
1576 2018-11-20 21:57:29 According to @realDonaldTrump #Khashoggi's life is too expensive to seek Justice! Money and oil and family deals is far more important than human rights! #SaudiArabia 
Trump looks weak! 
America looks weak!
1577 2018-11-20 21:57:26 Tough day today. Definitely wasn't looking for that kind of move in oil. Got in a little early, but I'm still ok with the prices on individual names. Got knocked out of $XOP breakeven, which turned out to be a blessing. Didn't do anything after lunch. Start over tomorrow.
1578 2018-11-20 21:57:24 Cough. But I also want to speak about the failings of the medical profession years ago. When my oldest was diagnosed w/autism 14 years ago, I was handed a pamphlet & shoved out the door, w/no info, no services, ripe for cons & snake oil salesman, it sadly isn’t much better
1579 2018-11-20 21:57:22 Hold down on screen and it should pop up
1580 2018-11-20 21:57:20 Also cod liver oil. Nordic naturals do a chewable non icky form. I virtually mainljne it at this time of year. Feel better soon!!
1581 2018-11-20 21:57:17 I just spent $35 on peanut oil because my brother insist on deep frying the turkey.
1582 2018-11-20 21:57:16 Okay, I'll concede. This POTUS doesn't dislike *all* Muslims and brown people. He only dislikes those Muslims and brown people w/o massive oil reserves who aren't doing multi-billion dollar business transactions with the U.S. Just them.
1583 2018-11-20 21:57:01 BREAKING: Country that relies on oil remains friendly with country that has oil.
1584 2018-11-20 21:56:58 The gold eco styled may be the worst one yet. I never have to lay my edges down with a scarf and even with a scarf this shit does nothing for me. The olive oil one has NEVER failed me.
1585 2018-11-20 21:56:50 My question is... if the antifreeze is oil base... how can you use it as a fire suppression?
1586 2018-11-20 21:56:42 It’s not like any African country because they had more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia and real estate that is worth more than the gdp of most african country’s. It’s a good example of why his theory doesn’t work in the long term. U can’t borrow forever! U can’t print money forvr
1587 2018-11-20 21:56:40 Reading a dairy free website that has fab recipes. 
One easy cookie recipe, gets comments of:
I'm off oil, can I not use any?
I'm off sugar, can I leave it out?
I hate coconut, can I leave that out?
Can I leave out the salt?
GO FIND ANOTHER RECIPE.
1588 2018-11-20 21:56:32 The only people who believe this are too drunk on the kook aid or do not know social media platform works 

They at the very least clearly have zero interface with twitter to think anyone here would buy that snake oil excuse

1589 2018-11-20 21:56:22 If @realDonaldTrump wants to hurt Saudi Arabia over Jamal Khashoggi he could radically and speedily get the US to transition away from oil. Tech is there. Increased energy security with decreasing environmental damage and jobs. Everyone would love him!
1590 2018-11-20 21:56:15 it’s like rainforest certified so it’s more sustainable than regular palm oil
1591 2018-11-20 21:56:14 Is it just me or is Stouffer one of the most annoying Oil henchmen on the god dam planet. That and he’s turning jack Michaels into a completely unlistenable version of him. Oil a.m. broadcasts are horrendous. #fuckStouffer
1592 2018-11-20 21:56:11 Not his personal business. You would be ok with China and/or Russia getting billions in business vs. the U.S. along with Saudi raising oil to top dollars?  Please help me understand your simple accusation.

1595 2018-11-20 21:55:51 Why do silly geese keep thinking we're in the 90s and the only major producer of oil is the Saudis? Oil imports from Saudi have been dropping every year for over a decade, replaced by American and West African suppliers. #cdnpoli Try to keep up with facts.

1609 2018-11-20 21:54:36 The arms/oil deals are not even confirmed. But surely trump and kirshner have been paid off by the saudis. Things are starting to look hopeless; that this criminal president will never be stopped and he will continue lining his pockets nomatter what.
1610 2018-11-20 21:54:33 Here in Canada, Climate Barbie @cathmckenna is tanking our economy for her unicorn fantasies, and Jihad Justin is buying Saudi oil instead of allowing our own resource industry to function.

1611 2018-11-20 21:54:30 Crazy disconnects make trading this thing rough.  When this happens, I move money in the retirement accts but leave the daytrading to when the markets line up.  Today bonds were flat while stocks were down 1.5 and oil down 6.  Stuff like that everyday makes analysis impossible.
1612 2018-11-20 21:54:27 (1/2) I agree with you that fat loss is accomplished by a caloric deficit, but the calories in coconut oil are not the same as calories found in butter and many other types of oils. Coconut oil is sent straight to the liver where it is instantly used as a source of energy,

1616 2018-11-20 21:54:17 Germany shot Saudi Arabia down if US shoots them down were they gonna go?  The oil statement is just wrong on every single turn.
1617 2018-11-20 21:54:15 That’s a huge drop in oil, oilies going to get hammered in the morning
1618 2018-11-20 21:54:14 You mention oil, is this going to be sustainable for the future generations?  What about the NHS infrastructure??
1619 2018-11-20 21:54:05 Omg. Next will we be looking for virgins to sacrifice to the "oil gods?"
1620 2018-11-20 21:54:05 It was banned as it was a political statement from Greenpeace. Sustainable palm oil is really a very good option it's higher yielding than other oils. This advert when released by Greenpeace was to highlight 'dirty' palm oil like what is in Oreos.

1627 2018-11-20 21:53:39 You think the Saudis will stop buying our military planes because you demand justice? It can’t be oil since we produce more than we need domestically! It’s hotel and other real estate dealings, right ? Yeah, the interests of the country come last !
1628 2018-11-20 21:53:39 The dollarization of oil, Intel, and support of Isreal that has this administration and those before it  pause and enable SA. Let's not forget GWB  protected Saudis by classifying 911 reports, Obama vetoed bipartisan bill to allow Americans to sue SA (lost) , and this crap.
1629 2018-11-20 21:53:34 Idk why I always agree to a courtesy inspection when I get my oil changed. They always come back with things wrong and I refuse to pay for them

1635 2018-11-20 21:52:48 Wonder how much money it takes to buy a Secretary of State? Seems like there is lots of Fun and Lots Of Oil Money available to Trump lackeys. These men should have to go to Kashoggi's widow and explain to her why they decided that it was ok for Saudis to butcher her husband.
1636 2018-11-20 21:52:46 It is about having access to Global markets vs having just one customer the USA. That is why they want to landlock all Canadian Oil. Unfortunately the Canadian Political powers that be are foolish enough to have let this happen. Tragic.
1637 2018-11-20 21:52:46 ... is somehow compatible with the science they insist they understand, which says we must leave at least 80% of all known oil reserves in the ground to hope to keep warming to no more than #1o5C.
1638 2018-11-20 21:52:39 I knew  he would say that. WHY trump want to take a huge slice of the oil business and become the  one of  richest man in the world.
1639 2018-11-20 21:52:37 As different as we are, our culture is much closer to Iran's than SA & that's in dress, traditions, everything. So why are we so aligned with SA? It's all about oil & the almighty dollar & that's all Trump cares about. That & his business interests, of course.

1647 2018-11-20 21:52:13 To everybody trippin over Trump not halting weapon sales to Saudi Arabia, understand its strict bipartisan policy to hug and kiss these genocidal maniacs for the petrodollar/oil industry. Barry, Bush 1& 2, Clinton, Reagan all did it.

1652 2018-11-20 21:52:03 Wow. So many lies. So they knew the Saudis, specifically MBS ordered the murder all along huh? Now, it's not about whether they did or not, it's about oil prices? We could simply buy from another country, and negotiate better prices for the larger purchases.
1653 2018-11-20 21:51:59 If we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof,” Trump told reporters later Tuesday as he left the White House to spend Thanksgiving in Florida. He added that given the U.S. interests at stake, “It’s a very simple equation for me.

1654 2018-11-20 21:51:59 Industry and their owners (e.g., palm oil) live by a simple mantra—profit today beats long-term profit potential or sustainability. Get rich and have the wealth to avoid or overcome adverse consequences of wealth building.
1655 2018-11-20 21:51:56 Finally getting my baby an oil change 
1656 2018-11-20 21:51:54 Please tell me the dems will not let this pass.  There has to be some justice for the Khashoggi family.  We cannot trust our government to do the right thing and the world thinks we're "for sale".  When did we start backing murderers for an arms deal or oil?  Sad day for the US.
1657 2018-11-20 21:51:54 ahhh do easy to look after a opposed to having to oil real wood etc... 
1658 2018-11-20 21:51:48 I think it is simpler: presidential emoluments. He has told us in his speeches. Weapons and oil is only the public justification for the argument.
1659 2018-11-20 21:51:43 This is a ridiculously stupid demo.  A turkey so large that it barely fits in a pot filled with oil within 2 or 3 inches from the brim?
1660 2018-11-20 21:51:36 Not only that. What do you use in place of oil in the chemical and plastics industry?
1661 2018-11-20 21:51:28 I think you should check the percentage of how much Saudi oil we buy before you start knocking the minister .

1670 2018-11-20 21:50:48 From Scriptures to babble.
What are you saying?
It's ok to support the murder of a journalist so long as there's enough guns & oil involved, but our failure to vanquish Khashoggi's death will create a flood of asylum requests by Saudis?  And that will that make MbS mad?
Or what?

1672 2018-11-20 21:50:39 Goldman Sachs: "Latest oil sell-off prices in an unlikely return to 2016 fundamentals "
1673 2018-11-20 21:50:34 They’re billions of dollars of investments in USA and oil. USA isn’t self sufficient and needs foreign energy. Canada can’t supply it all, can’t even get pipelines built in Canada. USA sure as hell isn’t going to supply themselves either.
1674 2018-11-20 21:50:30 But from a world perspective sticking with your existing vehicle saves more energy than any average driver can save in lifetime of driving. Over 1800 ltrs oil equiv goes into each new vehicle gas or electric.
1675 2018-11-20 21:50:29 and with EOY approaching and refiners ramping up, I think it's clear we're in for declines in oil inventories for a good portion of rest of year.
1676 2018-11-20 21:50:26 Wow Justin, that's a quite a 'snap' statement. So the future need for Copper and oil is going to diminish ?

1679 2018-11-20 21:50:15 Oil prices. And your money laundering.
1680 2018-11-20 21:50:14 Preening nonsense. Saudis for all their NUMEROUS faults, are MORE active against Jihadist ideology,both Sunni & Shia kind than ever,are a bulwark against Iran, are slowly reforming themselves domestically (in addition to oil/weapons). Would be INSANE to end that over Khassoggi.
1681 2018-11-20 21:50:14 So, did Trump say MBS was NOT involved?  No, he didn't.  Trump said, in effect, he's not going to deprive America's defense contractor's of billions of dollars, or allow price of oil to go crazy, over this.  Correct decision.
1682 2018-11-20 21:50:07 When I got lost I figured my mom went to school and my dad went to work. Never thought it was a big deal till I ran into the oil workers.

1687 2018-11-20 21:49:46 I’m honestly so sick of hearing people talk about essential oils like it’s not that hard to mix them with coconut oil and put it on your skin. I guess that’s just because I grew up with a hippie mom so it’s nothing frorgein to me 
1688 2018-11-20 21:49:44 Quick question. Do the natives get any money off the railways from the increase of oil shipped via rail? I wonder if camp cloud thought of this??
1689 2018-11-20 21:49:43 McLellan is a great coach, but not working. Oil had to do something to show they weren't going to ditch another season. People were beginning to talk. This should be a playoff team in this division.

1709 2018-11-20 21:48:59 it is 110% putting America first! if the Saudis/OPEC were to price oil in anything other than US dollars, it'd be lights out USA. both figuratively and literally

1717 2018-11-20 21:48:42 Barnett money? We generate £60 bill a year in revenue. If we had access to the oil revenues it will be much much more. This will take over the Barnett figure by miles. We will be better off.
1718 2018-11-20 21:48:39 Applying dry oil after vigorously scrubbing your skin from fake tan  ouch 
1719 2018-11-20 21:48:35 Oil price crash coupled with credit facility for crude oil from Saudi Arabia will have an overall very positive impact on Pakistani economy.
1720 2018-11-20 21:48:31 Trump is lying, denying the dangers of warming to the public, while forging new northern alliances around Arctic Oil. His extraction interest donors have known for decades about global warming, and melting ice already is affecting shipping channels.

1722 2018-11-20 21:48:23 Such utter nonsense & bullshit. How can you claim America First & then support murderous most-questionable "allies"?  Saudi Arabia was responsible for the 9-11 attacks on our Trade Center.  They have you over a barrel..of oil..& money to feed your absolute & unfulfillable greed.
1723 2018-11-20 21:48:23 Literally what is worse than oil to put in fuckin water, bitch NOTHING
1724 2018-11-20 21:48:23 Where was the rest of the money? Ask yourself, do you think he had all those South American pamphlets to find a job on an oil rig? *cough* embezzlement *cough*
1725 2018-11-20 21:48:20 'Nobody wants oil'...really?
1726 2018-11-20 21:48:15 Olive oil and paprika or Cajun! 
1727 2018-11-20 21:48:07 I’ve soent the last half hour looking online for CBD oil to use as an anti-inflammatory, but its a minefield of dosgy looking brands and hemp oil capsules. Anyone git any real advice on were to buy in the UK? #cbdoil #CBDuk #cannibidiol

1729 2018-11-20 21:48:05 This may be the dumbest tweet I have ever received and there have been some beauties...oil and gas is our largest industry and moronic not to have the full support of all levels of government
1730 2018-11-20 21:47:58 OK, fine....you convinced me.

Can we go take their oil?
1731 2018-11-20 21:47:45 its know that canola oil causes the alergy, prolong use of Canola are known to eventually cause Celiac ailment, just becareful of any apparent ailments they can get worse from side effects causing products. (there are a difference of side-effects & allergy) be in the know...
1732 2018-11-20 21:47:44 It really should be done. Sure it'd be a massive investment, but better refining would be a massive benefit. Same with oil towers- burning off "excess" natural gas is such a goddamn waste, instead of capturing it and transporting it and introducing it into natural gas systems.
1733 2018-11-20 21:47:37 Crude builds +10mmbbls last week, nary a ripple in price. Nothing material happens over the 19.5 hrs mkts closed, crude opens to a price collapses.
Just another day in crude oil.
1734 2018-11-20 21:47:34 Oil is on crash trajactory and if no reversal is in sight on Wednesday then #ATRL will see bulls unleashed when #PSX re-open on Thursday.
1735 2018-11-20 21:47:29 .....and oil
1736 2018-11-20 21:47:17 昨日久しぶりに定時で帰ろうと思ったら秒差で捕まったやつ。
やめて。やめて、。
1737 2018-11-20 21:47:08 Wait will there be oil involved? Can it be scented?
1738 2018-11-20 21:47:04 I made roasted pumpkin slices with onion, sage, cumin seeds, olive oil, and lemon juice as a side dish for Thanksgiving. It smells amazing.
1739 2018-11-20 21:47:01 3 parts olive oil to 1 part lemon juice, crushed garlic, anchovy paste, dijon mustard, salt & pepper, no raw egg. Yum!
1740 2018-11-20 21:46:48 Yeah there’s an oil you can put. Usually people put it because they are experiencing ear ache.... I don’t know what it’s callled. Maybe olive oil?
1741 2018-11-20 21:46:41 every time i get my oil changed i get a big discount cs i’m cute
1742 2018-11-20 21:46:37 What is The real Reason that Abubakar Atiku claims he has to want to sell The Nigerian NNPC? What is it? And why does All Northerners want Our Oil?
1743 2018-11-20 21:46:28 If I'm feeling extra disgusting, my favourite is thick layers of peanut butter and Dairylea cheese. But the best sandwich I ever had was melted brie, sliced mushroom and olive oil in Bologna. Had it for dinner every night of the trip 
1744 2018-11-20 21:46:28 Buena data. Rusia tampoco quiere un oil volando. Los 62/60 del brent le cierran.
1745 2018-11-20 21:46:20 These mfs been waiting 3 hours for a fucking oil change??? WTF
1746 2018-11-20 21:46:15 Translation: They loaned me money and we still need their oil...
1747 2018-11-20 21:46:10 “Changed circumstances” were the reasoning behind EE being squashed. Re-doing the consultation because the goal posts keep moving. Fact is oil is being given away at Hardisty, NatGas is near valueless in SE AB and Ottawa is silent.
1748 2018-11-20 21:46:10 You think this is the first in this is going to be the last murder over money and oil all
1749 2018-11-20 21:46:10 if i were rich i’d try to use that money to buy my way into congress 

if insurance and oil companies can do it i can too fuck this shit lmao
1750 2018-11-20 21:46:06 They’re Children’s future IS big oil & big pharma!! Stop expecting them to change! they’ll have plenty to stay healthy & rich., It’s our Children’s future that’s on the line. So what are we doing about it? We have to defund/boycott the bastards.. we have to force the change.

1752 2018-11-20 21:45:55 I think it's abstract notions of soft power vs. American material improvement.  I.e., "I'm putting America['s material wellbeing from oil and stuff] ahead of squishy notions of liberal values and the rules based order."
1753 2018-11-20 21:45:49 It would be way more accurate if you took out the casually. Sad news is they came back around when we got good again. Bandwagon POS’s need to stay over in Lucas Oil.
1754 2018-11-20 21:45:43 Oil change time
1755 2018-11-20 21:45:37 The chick is oil prices.

The Palace intrigue is far from over, but there is $ to be had as long as the Oil flows, and it's running out sooner than they want it to.
1761 2018-11-20 21:44:51 It's either that or annex Canada and take our Alberta oil sands.
1762 2018-11-20 21:44:49 Furthermore I'm speaking about US producers exclusively here insofar as "politics" is concerned. No seller in their right mind ever hedges for political reasons -- but they surely will take advantage of political gains to lock in profits ...... It's just part of the oil game

1768 2018-11-20 21:44:23 Can someone please sift through all the info on palm oil on the internet and give me the highlights pls
1769 2018-11-20 21:44:11 In the REAL WORLD-Cheap oil is a good thing!!
1770 2018-11-20 21:44:08 All of this sounds so unsound to me. Gasoline additive from US corn ethanol and Diesel additive from Indonesian palm oil. Is this how UK lives up to its biofuel standards?

1777 2018-11-20 21:43:37 If it wasn’t for the oil in Scottish waters, WM wouldn’t have been able to sell off the Gas, electricity, Royal Mail, NHS, Railways, steelworks, right to buy & a lot more, it has subsidised the destruction of the economy & the Unions
1778 2018-11-20 21:43:31 Stop letting IG convince you that you need to put weird douches and steam and “herbal” shit in your vagina. Nooo! Go to your OB regularly.

1781 2018-11-20 21:43:28 I've been looking at all this wrong.
The price of crude oil in terms of Bitcoin over the last month  is probably like perfectly flat.
(It's just that fiat is appreciating.)
1782 2018-11-20 21:43:24 SYDNEY: An oil spill's affecting traffic on Druitt St at Clarence St. Exercise caution & allow extra time through the area.
1783 2018-11-20 21:43:14 A lot of people think it's because of oil. It's really because of the number of U.S. companies invested  in Saudi Arabia and their significance as an ally in the region from which America can launch a myriad of military  operations. Just my opinion.
1784 2018-11-20 21:43:08 I think we should not be involved in #Yemen at all, whomever controls Yemen essentially controls the Suez Canal and the majority of shipping traffic between Asia and Europe, and Iran is trying to get control. 

It's not just a war for fun or about oil. It is complicated.
1785 2018-11-20 21:43:07 It's not at all when you assess the situation realistically. Does Senator Reed want Russia or China to make the billions we would have? Does he want low oil prices for consumers? Or to protect Israel? Trump's decision makes perfect sense.
1786 2018-11-20 21:43:01 Today I purchased beard oil and began reading the local newspaper. 

Figure that one out.
1787 2018-11-20 21:43:01 Hey Richard, go and ask WM what they did with 40 odd years of oil profits, as we have NO OIL FUND. Use your time productively please.
1788 2018-11-20 21:42:56 What about all the other products containing palm oil that you profit from?
1789 2018-11-20 21:42:55 Get your oil change 
1790 2018-11-20 21:42:53 They already have changed with us getting ripped out of the EU against our will. And we have a helluva lot more than oil gas and water.

I will save that for another day.

2)conservarlo como capital de HC tiene el problema del cambio de matriz energética  en el mundo en los próximos 50 años.
3)la maquina de impedir podrá tmb con esto?
1795 2018-11-20 21:42:26 I've commented on the mineral oil issue since I first read of it. Not something I regard as inert.
1796 2018-11-20 21:42:13 Kale delicious if it’s pan fried in just a little oil.  It gets so crispy.

1799 2018-11-20 21:42:05 And as a result, production would ramp up in other countries until the supply was back to the same levels. Oil producers pump it out of the ground if they can make a profit.

1802 2018-11-20 21:42:03 Fact: Saudi Arabia provides approximately 8% of US oil. 40+% is developed domestically and 15% comes from Mexico, a country Trump seems to have no issue insulting. This "oil price" fabrication has no grounding in the data.
1803 2018-11-20 21:41:56 15 of the 19 people who were part of the 9/11 attacks were from Saudi Arabia.They continue to House more isis members than any other middle eastern country and to add to the list Khashoggis death. Continuing to turn the other way in order to keep the money and oil flowing in.
1804 2018-11-20 21:41:48 Saudis want lower prices to drive more expensive sources of oil and gas out of the market. New sources of oil and gas in North America (like shale and oil sands) that allow the US and Canada to compete have a threshold price. Below that value it costs too much to extract & refine
1805 2018-11-20 21:41:42 Napakain na naman ng di oras.  goodnight
1806 2018-11-20 21:41:33 el k se ha suicidado es el oil......y me olvidado de poner el stop, me ha hecho daño
1807 2018-11-20 21:41:29 Oh, interesting. I've never tried Vietnamese cinnamon. I do tend to use applesauce instead of oil for sweeter breads & thicker cakes, unless the taste is apple-unfriendly.
1808 2018-11-20 21:41:28 Didn't Jin say he hasn't been cooking lately because hot oil splattered in his eye or sum?
1809 2018-11-20 21:41:24 Are you kidding? Our CIA determined the Saudi Crown Prince murdered a US resident. You do not let that stand. You cut off diplomatic ties & sanction tf out of them.

Trump's excuses that we need to keep the price of oil down or the weapons contract with them is total bs.
1810 2018-11-20 21:41:16 Im glad he does, because the USA depends on oil, and it would definitely get so many people pissed off.
1811 2018-11-20 21:41:10 chinese response maybe important than #api on #crudeoil #usoil #oil #oott If Chinese indicies continues to fall some weird paterns may continue even if not bearish reports
1812 2018-11-20 21:41:09 My oil was like 13,000 miles overdue 
1813 2018-11-20 21:41:05 Can anybody in the White House explain what Saudi Arabia oil production has to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a journalist and critic of the crown prince, who was deemed an "enemy of the state"?
Anyone?.... care to comment?
1814 2018-11-20 21:41:04 Because by God wherever Muslims are born or reside there is oil.. And that's what they want...
1815 2018-11-20 21:41:02 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1816 2018-11-20 21:41:01 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1817 2018-11-20 21:41:00 I am getting real sick of this country of murdering thugs getting a free pass because oil. Let’s not forget who killed 3000 people on 9/11. The Saudis should’ve been overthrown on 9/12
1818 2018-11-20 21:40:56 I wonder what we will blame when palm oil is banned
1819 2018-11-20 21:40:55 Share some of that oil money and I'll bet we'd change too..
1820 2018-11-20 21:40:53 and did it give him guarantees on oil prices?

Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
1823 2018-11-20 21:40:31 You're kidding right? Obama bowed to the muslim king. They trade oil in dollars. If china wants saudi oil, they have to buy it in dollars. It props up the dollar.

1825 2018-11-20 21:40:26 Oh so you will pay us all the increased oil price then?

1827 2018-11-20 21:40:20 exactly what I want to say: Oil provide11% increase of employment, the most of all industries in States. Low price will not benefit US.
1828 2018-11-20 21:40:16 With diminishing revenue from oil and no money from England,  I regret to say economically Scotland will be a basket case.
1829 2018-11-20 21:40:16 I've long had an issue with the US being in bed with Saudi Arabia.  This relationship isn't new.    It's an oppressive garbage monarchy with oil. Are there worse nations in the ME?  Yes & the enemy of your enemy may not be a friend, but they can be useful.  That's Saudi Arabia.
1830 2018-11-20 21:40:11 Should there not be any consequences for this. The oil industry doesn't care, but Canadians should.

1843 2018-11-20 21:39:32 12 countries or so in the EU have the population size of Scotland, with less GDP no oil too, and are daein cracking, a couple of whom were once colonies themselves, and 2 formerly British wans, being Ireland and Malta.

Ask them how they are daein with their "nationalism" bollox.
1844 2018-11-20 21:39:30 Three reasons we are trying to colonize mars: 1) The treaty of 1807 with the Venusians make it so we cannot visit Venus. 2) We heard there's oil there.

1848 2018-11-20 21:39:12 It's not the rest of Canada's fault that the oil sands aren't economically able to compete with other sources. It's a treat hearing that old Alberta arrogance again though. I missed it while the rest of the country was supporting you the last time oil prices tanked.

1850 2018-11-20 21:39:10 Even if that's true, which it definitely isn't for every game, even their existence in the background can tell us what we need to know about the way the world works. Eg. Does a city have oil lamps (or no streetlights)? Guess magic isn't common enough to light the streets then.

1854 2018-11-20 21:38:59 Let's see the EIA tomorrow...My bet on being big long from 58 is really based on HFI's research saying that Saudi oil exports to the US have plunged. If inventories start to draw then we go back to 60. But people are so hurt they need to see it every week.
1855 2018-11-20 21:38:54 I got this cough/sore throat/catarrh medicine tonight bc I’m still Not Well and it just

1859 2018-11-20 21:38:24 Very curious about what comes of PM Imran's trip to Malaysia. Perhaps the first foreign trip in which he's not requesting a financial bailout. Asking about Mahatir's China policy? Advice on anti-corruption? Free palm oil? Sunbathing on the beach? Who knows.
1860 2018-11-20 21:38:21 Yeah i called to complain yesterday and they told me i wasnt scheduled for oil until january. Smh
1861 2018-11-20 21:38:20 I haven't had an oil change since March. It's November

1865 2018-11-20 21:38:12 I looked at the ingredients and it had stuff that would make my face too oily and I didn’t want that haha so I decided to go with just one oil, rosehip seed oil, and serums that help with exfoliation, oiliness, hyper pigmentation, and texture of my skin! So far they have worked!

1869 2018-11-20 21:37:58 Our government is now engaging in extreme "HFT Price Controls" on oil as well as gold & silver. If you don't see that you probably shouldn't be an investor.

1875 2018-11-20 21:37:39 Actually, Saudi oil was 11.9%. Total petroleum products, including LNG and other energy "liquids" was 9% in 2017.
1876 2018-11-20 21:37:39 Warren Buffet’s view is “why use your own oil when you can use the other guy’s oil”. I’m not on board with that philosophy but I understand why he says it.
1877 2018-11-20 21:37:37 I have a love/hate relationship with baby oil. Love that it make my skin so smooth but hate that my butt crack is a slip and slid all day.
1878 2018-11-20 21:37:18 Come on Chris, it's all about keeping oil prices low and selling arms. Trump clearly doesn't care about anything else.

1881 2018-11-20 21:37:13 Well, maybe the Trump admin should facilitate another 15 - 20 assassinations by MBS. Then we'd have enough leverage over the Saudis to get our oil for free and more.

1899 2018-11-20 21:36:10 We won’t bcom industrialized until we address our energy/power problem. One of the highest electricity rates in SEA. We don’t have oil like neighbors. That’s why lose to most of them on FDIs. Well, we’re ahead of Myanmar. Lol

1909 2018-11-20 21:35:35 OK I'm no oil expert but even I know that our oil prices are down because of high production in OUR COUNTRY.
1910 2018-11-20 21:35:34 That's definitely become apparent. It's true of all supermarkets and we know it, but their stance on palm oil had given us hope for a change in approach. Hopes dashed, sadly.

1914 2018-11-20 21:34:59 because if SA and OPEC stopped trading oil in USD the american economy would likely collapse.

1922 2018-11-20 21:34:38 Our President just told the world this mans life was not worth barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia. I am totally embarrassed to be an American today. Trump is going to ruin our society as he makes governmental murder a mainstream negotiation in  international trade. #Kashoggi

1937 2018-11-20 21:33:39 I think there's going to be sufficient bipartisan support from the Republicans in the Senate for this to happen. They overrode on Russian sanctions, and they're like to do it here.

Especially any Republicans from oil producing states.

1938 2018-11-20 21:33:39 Yeah it was healthcare that destroyed the Venezuelan economy not nationalizing the only profitable export business so a charismatic autocrat could achieve godlike popularity despite every economist on the planet saying....hey maybe oil prices won't go up forever

1967 2018-11-20 21:31:52 The price of crude oil has become a curse instead of a blessing. 
If the price keeps soaring, NNPC will be forced to keep deducting from whatever source to offset/modulate/subsidize/underecover the cost @ N145/litre, 
Truth be told, this fuel price is not looking sustainable.
1968 2018-11-20 21:31:31 I agree. Watching it is like being forced to take castor oil when I was a kid.

These important news, which must be highlighted, is a matter of the future of an entire region.
1977 2018-11-20 21:31:10 The President said he doesn't want to jeopardize the deal with Saudi Arabia because he doesn't want oil to go to $100-$150 a barrel.

1980 2018-11-20 21:31:07 @realDonaldTrump @US_Stratcom Not a good idea, murder on Kashoggi happened on NATO soil NOT in Saudi Arabia, you have given FAKE-ALLIES that make FAKE-NEWS a weapon in the hand. You will soon see what I mean, we should just bomb those fucking Arabs and take the oil. Barbarians!
1981 2018-11-20 21:31:04 Go girl....
1982 2018-11-20 21:31:01 The moral of the story is Saudi Arabia can do anything it wants even kill U.S citizens or permanent residents as long as oil flows
1983 2018-11-20 21:30:56 We're only nice to Saudi Arabia cuz we want their oil
1984 2018-11-20 21:30:43 The c4 I am saving for the inevitable "God sent Donald Trump to save 'Merica." BTW, never throw a frozen anything in hot oil. You are asking for a world of trouble.
1985 2018-11-20 21:30:42 Currently have peppermint oil on me for my headache and stuffing my face with chocolate.
1986 2018-11-20 21:30:41 People forget that falling oil prices hit US producers as well. At a point oil has more valuable left in the ground - meaning layoffs.
1987 2018-11-20 21:30:41 No audible damage when replayed on mediocre equipment. Those things are junk. Not even toys. They serve no purpose. A waste of valuable crude oil.

1995 2018-11-20 21:30:10 3 men control the world price of oil: Trump, Putin, & Crowned Prince Bonesaw. That's the way they want it & the way they'll keep it. Together they leverage the whole world.

US promises to ‘disrupt’ oil shipments to Syria, sanctions Russian & Iranian companies
2001 2018-11-20 21:29:54 Kinda like the Canadian govt who’ve done what they can to ensure we use Saudi oil.
2002 2018-11-20 21:29:49 It would kill future projects and the cycle repeats we see an oil spike
...everything is cyclical
2003 2018-11-20 21:29:48 US oil companies would absolutely love $150/barrel prices.

2015 2018-11-20 21:28:57 Loren. Your explanation is great, except she doesn’t need the cap in the first place. Most people swim without a cap. Completely unnecessary use of oil and plastic by someone who spends all day every day attempting to shame the masses into environmental compliance. Do as I say...
2016 2018-11-20 21:28:55 It’s about the oil.
2017 2018-11-20 21:28:52 Yeah, we’re not vegetarians either but have reduced our meat consumption. I avoid anything with non sustainable palm oil in, but kinda assumed LM foods had higher ethical/environmental values.
2018 2018-11-20 21:28:51 Enzo what do you think about CBD oil in general, I've just started taking it because I've been told it helps people with joint problems especially shoulder and knee joints, how long does it take before you start feeling the benefits of it ?

2022 2018-11-20 21:28:31 @HFI_Research Hi - Any idea on when exactly the physical market for oil will begin to tighten ? At the pace that this is falling it is hard to even imagine a floor.
2023 2018-11-20 21:28:20 So this means open season on journalists...Wow I get oil is important to some but at least put some shade over your greed by calling them out
2024 2018-11-20 21:28:17 Sanction arms sales. Sanction oil sales as with Iran. Freeze assets. Freeze TRUMP assets which have any Saudi connections.

2038 2018-11-20 21:27:14 Even though the CIA said the Prince was involved, even though there is audio evidence (that he refuses to listen to btw), he is standing with the Saudis. His own Congress does not agree. He sold out a US resident for Saudi money and oil.

2042 2018-11-20 21:26:43 -Saudi Arabia murdered Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump: “It is what it is.”

-He was an American resident with US citizen kids.
Trump: “Whaddya gonna do?”

-You’re allowing a government to literally get away with murder for oil and arms deals.
Trump: “”
2043 2018-11-20 21:26:42 In the extreme case even dissolving NAFTA will not have a material impact on Canadian Crude production or supply to the US or survival of Canada.
However, the KSA regime could collapse if the US walked away from it, an implication that would impact oil markets immediately.

2050 2018-11-20 21:26:26 So the #CROTOO just very specifically put arms deals and oil ahead of justice for a brutally murdered man. In case you had any hopes about the current form of the american republican party putting compassion or life-and-death, existential concerns above profit in any OTHER contex
2051 2018-11-20 21:26:25 No. It is an index of multinationals, weighted heavily towards oil, that earn revenues in many countries and currencies.
2052 2018-11-20 21:26:25 so.....are you going to tell Trump that, cuz it doesn't appear he cares whether or not countries commit Hr violations if they have oil and buy arms from US.
2053 2018-11-20 21:26:22 I’ve read about it but I went w/ the Ordinary products instead. I already use rosehip seed oil and that helps with acne. I recently bought alpha arbutin from TO and it’s helping with the hyperpigmentation. I’ve only been using it two months and it’s helped.
2054 2018-11-20 21:26:16 Shipping Saudi oil in diesel tankers to supply Canada doesn’t seem very environmental to me...what do you say Catherine? #cdnpoli
2055 2018-11-20 21:26:16 The United States said on Tuesday it had moved to disrupt an Iranian-Russian network that sent millions of barrels of oil to Syria and hundreds of millions of dollars to indirectly fund militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.
2056 2018-11-20 21:26:14 U.S. stocks extended their selloff on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 hitting a three-week low, as energy shares dropped with oil prices and retailers including Target and Kohl's sank after weak earnings and forecasts.

2059 2018-11-20 21:26:07 Take a whole week without doing your make up . It’s an interesting journey, just put some grape seed oil to moisturize and hydrate and some lip gloss and mascara
2060 2018-11-20 21:26:06 The US is being taken over and destroyed by oil rich countries . They are tearing down our infrastructure so they can take over completely.
2061 2018-11-20 21:26:05 Josh, you and I know it’s all about the weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Thats why nothing will change here. Donny just can’t say that, so oil is the narrative.
2062 2018-11-20 21:26:03 President Trump not making friends in Texas: "Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof. I’ve kept them down; they’ve helped me keep them down. Right now we have low oil prices, or relatively: I’d like to see it go down even lower"
2063 2018-11-20 21:26:00 Oil is down down... Trump says its where he wants it and plans on keeping it down....ok we dont have to have 100$ a barrel... but do we always have to be the pawn..
2064 2018-11-20 21:25:56 @CNN @washingtonpost @NYT @MSNBC @vox @BBC @ajam Prez Dump just said, re: Khashoggi's death: 1) "It's all about American 1st." (a White Nationalist slogan), 2) "100's of Billion Dollar$ from S. Arabia & a million US jobs", 3) "It's about Iran" & 4) "It's about low oil prices."...
2065 2018-11-20 21:25:47 Alhamdulillah
2066 2018-11-20 21:25:43 Oil prices, unsubstantiated defense contracts, and their investments in Trump properties are @realDonaldTrump 's priority over a slain reporter. For all you Trump supporters don't travel overseas because you will be left out to hang by @realDonaldTrump.
2067 2018-11-20 21:25:41 Don’t have time??? Can’t believe that a @HamptonChevy service advisor told me they couldn’t do an oil change AND tire rotation because they didn’t have the time to do both. Never mind that I had an appointment and I am in fact BUYING their time for a service!!!
2068 2018-11-20 21:25:36 Shhhhh don't tell them what the truth is, we want to continue to watch the Oil burn 
2069 2018-11-20 21:25:36 They are thousands in number and no individual case could make it to the media to attract sympathy from the public, why then would politicians care?
Also, no big deals, businesses, oil support their cases, why to bother!?
2070 2018-11-20 21:25:36 I can go toe-to-toe w/anyone on indicators, I'm actively involved in Oil&Gas Inv., mergers & divestments. But that's not the point here, It's Advocating for the industry, I spend time with those on the marble floors and in the field and Notley is not respected as their advocate!

2072 2018-11-20 21:25:28 Syria has the oil, yet the US is illegally occupying the oilfields. What more can be said about the despotic acts coming from DC?
2073 2018-11-20 21:25:27 It’s cool to murder Americans, just keep the oil coming.                -@realDonaldTrump
2074 2018-11-20 21:25:25 When trump says “we have to remain allies w/Saudi unless you want oil prices to go to $150 barrel. We NEED SA!” Why do NO reporters ever reply “Canada has the 3rd most oil reserves in the world that sell to us as well w/new methods WE the USA can produce most of what we need.
2075 2018-11-20 21:25:22 Huh? Please re-read. You misunderstand.
The oilsands are the environment and have been naturally seeping into the river for eons. Nothing to do with the production operations.
Oil companies are working on "dismantling" the seeping oil.
2076 2018-11-20 21:25:09 The U.S. is dependent on Saudi oil. Most are not willing to pay more for gas or ride a bike.
2077 2018-11-20 21:25:03 Where does Jiffy Lube get the audacity to charge $90 for an oil change? That at least should include a reach around.

2079 2018-11-20 21:25:01 Khashoggi murdered. A US President without even a shred of moral fibre.  It's all about weapons and oil - and both of those are bad for our planet.
2080 2018-11-20 21:24:53 Moral Of The Story: 

Produce lots of oil 

Buy lots of U.S. Arms

2082 2018-11-20 21:24:49 Screw their arms orders, screw their oil.
2083 2018-11-20 21:24:48 Do I look like someone who is about to spend $70 on an oil change??? think again child
2084 2018-11-20 21:24:47 Occupation .... Sovereignty is a foundational principle of international law. The US is in Syria without invitation and has been ask to leave many times. US and Israel have bases and are pumping and stealing oil daily in occupied territories that don' belong to them.
2085 2018-11-20 21:24:47 Take and oil up those titties, slide my thick shaft between them. Then when I am about to eject my thick ,hot  load , pull out and drench those is sweet tasting cum.
2086 2018-11-20 21:24:36 With oil slipping to $53 a barrel, why would anyone trust Russia to build quality anything?
2087 2018-11-20 21:24:35 Realpolitiks. Only difference Trump is so dumb he exposes the elephants (camels?) in the room. Saudis can destroy world economy with oil moves; Saudis currently committing genocide in Yemen; Saudi nationals all responsible for 911... no one, not a single admin messes w them.

The fact that you don't understand is why you talk out of your ass.
2090 2018-11-20 21:24:19 Thats slightly hilarious but cute.  I cuddle my accordion quite often just because thats necesssary.  Currently, as well as wanting to jump off a cliff, wondering whether I can pour cooking oil into my accordion

2101 2018-11-20 21:23:15 Smuggling oil in Norwegian tankers has been a lucrative business for years
2102 2018-11-20 21:23:10 That’s ridiculous/. We have billions of oil stored and produce tons of it ourselves. Let’s get with renewable sources of power and let the Middle East stop warring due to excess wealth which is never, never enough.
2103 2018-11-20 21:23:06 Vitamin C on my face, let that sit for about 5 minutes and then add my aloe Vera gel and then my squalane(oil) and then moisturiser and then spf.

2110 2018-11-20 21:22:29 How many more bodies would it take? The president then says, oh "... its only 100 deaths, but the price of oil would go through the roof!"
2111 2018-11-20 21:22:27 Has anyone used CBD oil for anxiety and sleeping? Does it help?
2112 2018-11-20 21:22:22 Only in Detroit can you get yo tires changed , oil checked , some chicken, fries, hot sauce and some minutes on yo phone all at the same place
2113 2018-11-20 21:22:20 Oil is thicker than blood.

2115 2018-11-20 21:22:19 Hell, I'm not even sure we're winning on the balance sheet on oil even.  We produce more than Saudi.  On net, I think they suffer more if oil prices drop than we do, but we both suffer.  At $80+/bbl, big parts of the US (particularly red parts) boom economincally.
2116 2018-11-20 21:22:18 I bought my first CBD oil today and I’m so ready to not be anxious 
2117 2018-11-20 21:22:15 do people actually dip a piece of bread into olive oil and then eat it???? g r o s s
2118 2018-11-20 21:22:13 @realDonaldTrump amazingly claims that he & MBS are setting the world price of oil. + his response on #IvankasEmails "I looked at it very briefly today." Of course it was brief, like 2 seconds. Any longer and he'd see something. And get eye strain.
2119 2018-11-20 21:22:13 The get out card or price to pay to stay clean is lower oil price for a quarter or so.
2120 2018-11-20 21:22:12 I particularly liked the bits where he smeared the victim, but that he was single handedly ensuring the world’s oil prices stayed low
2121 2018-11-20 21:22:05 I like the Banilla Co cleansing balm as my first cleanser! It’s oil based so it gets alll the dirt off. And then use a gentle or foaming cleanser after and ta da! You’ve got the double cleanse down!
2122 2018-11-20 21:21:59 He’s so full of shit.. Saudi oil makes up a small % of our oil consumption.  Will the hurry &
#ImpeachTrump
2123 2018-11-20 21:21:59 Onions, lettuce, tomato, oil, vinegar and spices
2124 2018-11-20 21:21:56 Yes the people of the earth should sue them and the governments  for damages to the earth and those who continue to die due pollution. Anyway they dig up the oil which belongs to humanity and they sell it us and keep all the money same with the mineral wealth of the planet
2125 2018-11-20 21:21:45 Trump trying to save Crown Prince against Europe and other side of deep America for sell weapons to get Saudis oil monies
2126 2018-11-20 21:21:43 Their oil is also more valuable then three buildings in downtown NYC. 
2127 2018-11-20 21:21:38 You get that Trump just got on his knees for Saudi? They now know that if they buy weapons or sell us oil, they can kill who they want.
So we are selling weapons to those that have no problem chopping up people they don’t agree with. 

What happens when they don’t agree with us?
2128 2018-11-20 21:21:35 Do you have a preference or one that you feel more confertable with? Landscapes looked oil, but the others seemed digital and the like :)
2129 2018-11-20 21:21:34 Why, when trump keeps saying “we have to remain allies w/Saudi unless you want oil prices to go up to $150 barrel. We NEED SA!” Why do NO reporters ever retort with “Our good neighbor to the north have the 3rd most oil reserves in the world that sell to us”?
2130 2018-11-20 21:21:34 Saudi can make oil over $100 per barrel. 4-10 weeks of that and it all starts going to shit. All food, goods, medical... Dive. 

Central Bank Crypto is ready to replace dollar. If Elite blame a huge crash on Trump their evil Crypto sells to the People. 

VZ could provide the oil.
2131 2018-11-20 21:21:33 So we no longer stand for #HumanRights, we no longer stand for #FreedomOfPress, we are only about money, oil prices and how they effect the wallets of the 1%, the whole #TrumpAdministration is Un-American that they can look the other way on a murderer for money
2132 2018-11-20 21:21:29 Again, what's the US supposed to do?  We need oil.  ALL suppliers of oil are shady characters. Every president has been forced to deal with shady characters, for oil. Not a Trump fan.  But, I don't think he's the only POTUS that had to roll in the mud, for oil reasons.
2133 2018-11-20 21:21:28 Bolton probably wrote it, but it’s #TRUMP’s viewpoint. 
So-called @POTUS just stood on the WH lawn & told the world  that the price of oil is more important than American values & human life.  He just gave other nations permission to capture, torture & kill anyone, w/o blowback.
2134 2018-11-20 21:21:28 For the people who oppose what Pompea said to support president Trump about Saudi Arabia we tell you what if Saudi Arabia used oil as a weapon, we will see your anger and blame the president.Just make sure the president wants the interest of America and Saudi at the same time.
2135 2018-11-20 21:21:25 Even with a ring on my finger and a child in the back seat this man is changing my oil in my car and is flirting his ass away 
2136 2018-11-20 21:21:21 fat and/or oil
you're fine
it's fine
everything is fine
2137 2018-11-20 21:21:20 E oil
2138 2018-11-20 21:21:19 What are they gonna do?  Not sell oil?  They can’t eat it.  They import most of their food
2139 2018-11-20 21:21:06 Yup. and i hardly see any products of oil palm in Europe. But i wonder if somehow there is truth behind this campaign, of simply it is the same thing actually. Because i rarely sees any area which can be categorised as real forest like back in Malaysia in Europe.
2140 2018-11-20 21:21:06 Gee, can’t you get your  boss, Putin, to sell us oil real cheap?
2141 2018-11-20 21:20:58 Price of oil > press members life
2142 2018-11-20 21:20:50 can I pour cooking oil into my piano accordion? 
2143 2018-11-20 21:20:36 Marshfield interior  project. 

All the trim on this project received fine paints of Europe oil undercoat  primer. The top coat is semi-gloss Benjamin Moore Advance. 

All products were put on using a graco 395  air assisted airless sprayer to provide high-quality results.
2144 2018-11-20 21:20:17 If indeed it is found with solid evidence that the Crown Prince knew about the assassination, then there will have to be some serious negotiation. If anything, this would give us the chance of energy independence in breaking away from the Saudis. We do after all have enough oil.
2145 2018-11-20 21:20:17 Agreed. But that’s not the way things work here in Oil town
2146 2018-11-20 21:20:16 False alarm... he opened the control valve and the psi dropped back to 60.

Said antifreeze is oil based and expands in the warm temperatures.
2147 2018-11-20 21:20:14 Onions, lettuce, tomato, oil, vinegar, and spices
2148 2018-11-20 21:20:14 So, the message I expect Saudi Arabia is getting is that if the next time they murder and dismember an American journalist, say - Lester Holt, or perhaps an American family from Ohio - the U.S. will look the other way because we are total whores for oil blood money. #Kashoggi
2149 2018-11-20 21:20:09 Need a Mobil jet II oil retailer please holla
2150 2018-11-20 21:20:06 Global warming, climate change are lies. All thru history mother earth has taken care of weather. To make plants grow, to clean the air, to keep oceans alkaline. To give fresh water. But the fracking, underground tunnels, oil rigs, trees cut by millions  & fake weather kills all
2151 2018-11-20 21:20:05 Weyyyyyyyy! Was waiting for this  

By the way...

Oil

Oil on the road
2152 2018-11-20 21:20:04 Good olive oil I hope
2153 2018-11-20 21:20:04 Having to buy new tires and get an oil change I hate adulting wah
2154 2018-11-20 21:20:03 What this gangster @realDonaldTrump & his Junta is telling the rest of the world is that America will look the other way if you are a murderous butcher so long as we get oil or benefit BUT if not, we will come after or sanction you. See why they think we are HYPOCRITES?
2155 2018-11-20 21:19:58 Righnt now I'm listening to history of Stonewall Jackson & tactics of war. Then review of "First Man" Iran sending oil to China, beginnings of Cold War in 1945, Stan Musial, "Xi Becomes Mao", Jordan, Taliban, mid terms, etc
2156 2018-11-20 21:19:57 More like Saudi Oil Money First
2157 2018-11-20 21:19:56 That’s facts ... but have you tried frying pizza in a little oil in a frying pan? Makes the crust crunchy and the top also gets melty again
2158 2018-11-20 21:19:52 Not being able to get finger oil on the lightning pins and eventually getting the black scorched pins will be nice too.
2159 2018-11-20 21:19:47 Is this that bad for a country that nowadays exports oil & gas?
2160 2018-11-20 21:19:47 Someone plz remind me to get an oil change b4 my car blows up thanks
2161 2018-11-20 21:19:44 Sure.  Why not.

Hope you like global warming.  The only person thst got more oil money was Ted Cruz.
2162 2018-11-20 21:19:43 American foreign policy according to @realDonaldTrump: “Kill whoever you want, just help keep oil prices down.”
2163 2018-11-20 21:19:43 If it had been a Fox reporter, Riyadh would already a smoking ruin.

And Trump would be like, "we're going to take their oil!"
2164 2018-11-20 21:19:40 Anytime you roast or bake any protein, slice the top off a whole garlic head. The roasted cloves then go great w oil olive, fresh ground pepper, sea salt and about anything on earth.
2165 2018-11-20 21:19:38 No really writing 5 pages about how oil crippled our economy is really what I want to do as a marketing major on my Tuesday. Maybe a lot of sarcasm 
2166 2018-11-20 21:19:37 Sorry. Can't do that... that would be Montreal and Victoria. Well Victoria isn't polluting a river, but you get the idea.

BTW, speaking of polluting rivers, the oilsands are trying to clean up that big oil deposit that's been seeping into the Athabasca River.
2167 2018-11-20 21:19:28 Oil & money are more important than lives to these evil leaders.
2168 2018-11-20 21:19:26 $CL_F $SPY $SPX $DJIA $DIA $QQQ $VXX $TVIX $UVXY 
Trump: I've kept oil prices down, I want them to go lower
2169 2018-11-20 21:19:24 Ugh....just when I discovered a leaf I enjoyed with olive oil & lemon.
2170 2018-11-20 21:19:15 The last thing we need is a Repugnant Slug and a Snake Oil salesman is charge !! Their lies got us into this mess, what happened to the Orderly simple Brexit they told us about ?
2171 2018-11-20 21:19:14 They just found the biggest oil resovoire in the world west of Harris. Haaaaaaaaaaaaw !
2172 2018-11-20 21:19:10 I don’t trust Haye and his snake oil tactics. Plus prior to catching Takam, Dereck was taking a beating. He’s an old 34. We can hope though.
2173 2018-11-20 21:19:09 What about the scientists hired by Exxon in the 90s who found the same results? They were hired by oil companies, that's Ipwhere they get their money.
2174 2018-11-20 21:19:04 @jambeauty89 your item was delivered to your po box tpday! The  oil! PLEASE TRY IT! Im hoping you will love it as muchbas I think you will. Please tweet me when you try it I have to know how you like it
2175 2018-11-20 21:18:57 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
2176 2018-11-20 21:18:53 Just wondering...do we REALLY need palm oil? I think not but it seems to be ubiquitous. 
#SaveOurPlanet
2177 2018-11-20 21:18:51 This is at the same time as the US is illegally occupying Syria’s oil fields…
2178 2018-11-20 21:18:47 I know that and you just made my point. Canada produces oil and gas for the world markets. Those countries that just import all their energy will by default have lower emissions. So will cou tries that are further south.

The metric is irrelevant. It's about improvement from 2005
2179 2018-11-20 21:18:43 Trump you are just such a complete sleazebag... ‘MBS is a brutal murderer, but he gives us MONEY, so we’ll side with him’... YOU SCUMBAG, let ‘em drink their oil!!!
2180 2018-11-20 21:18:38 No sympathy for people who chuck water on burning oil I’m tryna let natural selection take its course
2181 2018-11-20 21:18:33 Definitely doing a hot oil treatment and deep condition when I get home
2182 2018-11-20 21:18:29 Garth Brooks and Social media are like oil and water. Hahaha.
2183 2018-11-20 21:18:28 i just want to take a nap before work but i need to go get my oil change
2184 2018-11-20 21:18:23 @L_u_cy CBD Oil for pain, no THC so you do not get high. Legal in every state.
2185 2018-11-20 21:18:13 Slaughtering animals seems like a strange way of caring for them. Clearly I was talking about the average person, i.e the majority of people talking about palm oil, and those people will get most of their meat from cheap sources.
2186 2018-11-20 21:18:08 False alarm... he opened the control valve and the psi dropped back to 60.

Said antifreeze is oil based and expands in the warm temperatures.
2187 2018-11-20 21:18:07 Really, America will bend down to Saudi  Arabia because of oil? Weak
2188 2018-11-20 21:18:03 He spent 8 years selling snake oil and he's still doing it.When Obama was elected there was an article about the previous President staying out of the way and minding his own business.I wish he and his wife would stayed away. But then again it drives more to vote Republican.
2189 2018-11-20 21:18:00 would have to have sustained low oil price for 6-9 months @ $40-45
2190 2018-11-20 21:17:59 Don’t forget about #climatechange and #SolarPower. Exempt alternative energy from the passive activity loss rules (like oil & gas) and extend the 30% renewables tax credit.
2191 2018-11-20 21:17:53 We don’t ‘need’ the Saudis. They’ve done more for Trump and his family than they have for the US. The ‘arms deal’ and ‘jobs’Trump speaks of are nonexistent. We can get oil elsewhere. The war in Yemen is a human rights disaster and was started by KAS, NOT Iran! No deals with MBS!
2192 2018-11-20 21:17:53 Turkey has been stealing Kurdish wealth, oil, culture,its ancient history, Kitchen and all, stealing olive and olive oil is the new low! Erdogan knows he'll get away with any bullshit he throws at EU and USA
2193 2018-11-20 21:17:40 Peter continues to tell half truths which is what makes his commentary so abnoxious. Sure the US economy is in a bubble BUT it will not be saved by gold (that he is selling). Snake oil salesman. Dishonest, untruthful and an old man who has lost his way.
2194 2018-11-20 21:17:27 That is ahistorical. Which industries did Harper kneecap? Was the carbon tax Harper's idea?

I am acutely aware of the industries Justin has been attacking. Trains full of oil go by my house every day... or, as we call them, "liberal pipelines."
2195 2018-11-20 21:17:15 I just wonder just how long it will be before I can buy #cbd oil in the UK ?
2196 2018-11-20 21:17:13 Where have we heard this before?! Amazing the resonance of such stories with our Basque, Breton, Galician, Oïl. Why is it that the majority so fears the minority? All we want is the freedom to exist as equals.
2197 2018-11-20 21:17:09 Not that many. Connected to a decrease in vaccination.

What advantage do people get by vaccinating? Most vaccinations are paid for by the government in the end, so why would they encourage it is it truly is harmful snake oil?
2198 2018-11-20 21:17:02 and yes, I was about to add a tweet saying I recognize the price of oil is affected by global supply and demand (including cartel decisions to limit or increase supply)
2199 2018-11-20 21:17:01 @Morning_Joe @morningmika @WillieGeist    You guys can’t let this Saudi Arabia decision die after two days.  Trump just sold out this country to the Crown Prince for some oil. We don’t need oil with blood in it.
2200 2018-11-20 21:16:55 I meant the oil gurus who at 45 said I told you it was going up. Well they didn’t say that at 26 as if they were that good they wouldn’t be on Twitter they’d probably be getting a blowy on the m25 in the latest Bugatti #mic drop fiesta driver 
2201 2018-11-20 21:16:50 Last time oil sank OPEC stubbornly dragged their heels on making production cuts.

I expect they will act much quicker this time around.

2203 2018-11-20 21:16:46 A good part of his base wouldn’t mind $150 barrel oil....
2204 2018-11-20 21:16:45 Interesting tooth fairy results so far. A clear spectrum of lowest value (50p) in the home counties to highest (£2+) in Aberdeenshire!

I presume the fairies sell the teeth to the oil industry, for using on the business end of giant drill bits. Localised supply and demand, right?
2205 2018-11-20 21:16:44 You'd think the Doc would've figured out electric cars, especially because they came before oil cars.
2206 2018-11-20 21:16:44 simple: don't have oil
2207 2018-11-20 21:16:44 US Closing prices: #DOW -2.21% #NASDAQ -1.75% #Ftse100 -0.76% #GBPUSD 1.2782 #EURGBP 0.8892 #EURUSD 1.1367 #Gold 0.09% #Oil -0.20%
2208 2018-11-20 21:16:44 For those of us who occasionally battle with being ashy:  Argan oil in the day and Vitamin E cream at night.
2209 2018-11-20 21:16:33 Funny how I love palm oil in my noodles
2210 2018-11-20 21:16:33 oil production has nothing to do with it,  trump ready gave the go ahead for 8 countries to buy oil from Iran= 3/4 of their production.
2211 2018-11-20 21:16:25 Powell has already blinked if you know where to look. Do you really think oil prices have been killed from lower demand? All markets are rigged by collusive Fed/Treasury with oil take down the latest example of Stealth QE to try to save tepid economy. ZIRP & oil take down by HFT.
2212 2018-11-20 21:16:20 Translation - I have business there and they buy real estate from my family. The other excuse is ridiculous considering we have huge stockpiles of oil and don't even get most of it from foreign sources anymore.
2213 2018-11-20 21:16:20 Can't you just apply olive oil and take a pic?
2214 2018-11-20 21:16:15 How is Trump keeping oil prices down...is he running OPEC now as well...Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in OPEC...that organization helps to regulate oil prices and supply...but nice try
2215 2018-11-20 21:16:11 Thanks for the excellent overview and timeline. The CIA assessment is what the rest of us knew from the beginning. And the oil price connection explains Trump backing the Saudis, among other reasons.
2216 2018-11-20 21:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but much else.
2217 2018-11-20 21:15:54 Fifteen of the nineteen 9/11 terrorists were Saudi citizens. "Honest and strong relationship."

So to clarify: An American President is going to do nothing about an American resident with three citizen children being murdered because of oil. Got it.
2218 2018-11-20 21:15:47 Sleep more. Reduce caffeine. Eliminate artificial sweeteners. Take a bath with epsolm salts. Use Holy Basil. Have more sex (or exercise). Take CBD oil. 
2219 2018-11-20 21:15:42 To the people who want us to give up Saudi..... better not complain when oil and gas go up. Yes it’s horrible what happened but let’s no bite off our nose despite are face. 
I can see it now, The left.... “wow trump made gas and oil go up what a jerk”.  Well left, try to think.

2221 2018-11-20 21:15:21 most times i mix it in with my moistureizer but if my skin is feeling really dry i apply it on its own either before or after moisturizer depending if it’s thicker or thinner than the oil
2222 2018-11-20 21:15:19 We wouldn’t be in a war if it wasn’t for America wanting so much oil, power and resources
2223 2018-11-20 21:15:18 Those are meaningless stats. Oil is a globally traded commodity and any threats to Saudi supply would have an impact on prices everywhere. Yes, even Canadian prices would increase significantly.
2224 2018-11-20 21:15:17 Mehn
My oil painting is actually coming out well 
Can't believe this 
Hardwork and patience pays
2225 2018-11-20 21:15:16 @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott As your constituent, I’m imploring you to condemn SA’s Crown Prince for his involvement in #KhashoggiMurder When America overlooks dismembering of American resident b/c of “oil” we look weak & immoral. Please release audio of murder!
2226 2018-11-20 21:15:08 But Iranians are trustworthy? 
These countries use us, we use them. There is little high moral ground to be found in the Islamic world period. If you were really as pure as you pretend, we would have nothing to do with any of them. It's not realistic
2227 2018-11-20 21:15:07 The current circumstances are due to govt action/inaction over the last 10 or more yrs. There's blame to share. Since 2014 the global oil market has disadvantaged Ab, this month it is now evident that Fed actions are necessary for benefit of Cda & Ab. Notley on it, watching Feds.
2228 2018-11-20 21:15:05 They need to somehow release the CIA evidence on the Khashoggi murder. 

For arms deals and oil money, President Trump wants us to maintain our full relationship with Saudi Arabia...RIDICULOUS!
2229 2018-11-20 21:15:02 World needs oil, and, well...
2230 2018-11-20 21:14:59 It isn't about the oil. It's about the petro dollar. That's the importance of the relationship. Not the tangible good itself.
2231 2018-11-20 21:14:58 America has;  invaded multiple nations to steal OIL, murdered civilians, destabilized multiple nations, interfered in elections & supported oppressive regimes! Who will sanction America? #SaudiArabia #Iran #Iraq #Yemen #Egypt #Turkey #Syria #Afghanistan #Africa #Libya #Venezuela
2232 2018-11-20 21:14:56 I smell unsaid words that feel something like- make the price of crude oil slide and I’ll play stupid. Make it drop below fifty bucks and I’ll play extra stupid
2233 2018-11-20 21:14:54 Morals, shmorals....btw oil is fairly cheap
2234 2018-11-20 21:14:54 anything b  clay masks and tea tree oil are good and exfoliating is important. can use salicylic acid scrubs too.
2235 2018-11-20 21:14:48 the US, UK, French, us etal since the Ottomans' fall has considered the Saudis and Gulfies to be critical allies, not least because of oil but because they abut the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea/Suez Canal. Trump simply said in Queens-isms the reality of our predicament.
2236 2018-11-20 21:14:45 Get Iranian oil from a democratic country, not from 911 perpetuator s
2237 2018-11-20 21:14:43 So to clarify: An American President is going to do nothing about an American resident with three citizen children being murdered because of oil. And you think that's a good thing. Got it.
2238 2018-11-20 21:14:38 If it’s American chocolate it generally tastes like mildly cocoa-flavoured gritty olive oil.

2240 2018-11-20 21:14:30 S/o to my babe for changing my oil 
2241 2018-11-20 21:14:13 "Prices plunge. Sales soar. Rampant overproduction produces 50% decline in prices according to economists."
OPEC oil?
Naw, Oregon marijuana.
2242 2018-11-20 21:14:12 An essential oil aromatherapy roller. Let me know if you want the recipe. It's all natural. You need to do as you tell others.....RELAX! Get a couple of diffusers for you and Domonic in your home. They have travel ones for when you're back n forth from AZ to CA.
2243 2018-11-20 21:14:09 So to clarify: An American President is going to do nothing about an American resident with three citizen children being murdered because of oil. Got it.
2244 2018-11-20 21:14:01 Lmao, we need their money for our spending, not their oil production... it’s ok, just tell us the truth...
2245 2018-11-20 21:14:00 rite aid out here trying to scam me, $7 for baby oil LOL
2246 2018-11-20 21:13:52 Nobody consumes more organic coconut oil than me. Nobody
2247 2018-11-20 21:13:45 @FmnJohn said it well elsewhere on Twitter: So, in short, killing Kashoggi was bad, but Saudi Arabia provides so much of that sweet sweet oil (which is all about putting "America First"), because America in 2018 has the values of a mafia crime family.
2248 2018-11-20 21:13:41 I just want these ppl to come get their truck so I can get my oil change
2249 2018-11-20 21:13:39 Is it true that Horgan (BC) #Gov is receiving “kickbacks” from U.S. lobbyist for blocking #pipeline  ?
Keeping Canada out of the oil business is worth billions to U.S. companies
2250 2018-11-20 21:13:32 Your talking Saudi Arabia you know the USA's ally you sell them weapons and buy there oil and look the other way when they break records for how many heads chopped off In a year.... and you wonder why people have had enough with politicians....
2251 2018-11-20 21:13:07 What about a oil change kuz?
2252 2018-11-20 21:13:01 @cindyhydesmith You are a horrible example of a human being & should withdraw from the runoff.  How dare you pretend to uphold the Constitutional rights of Americans when you talk about being front row at a public hanging.  You;re a dinosaur who needs to become oil underground
2253 2018-11-20 21:13:00 Double the price of oil for a dissentient???

2255 2018-11-20 21:12:51 oil is not really the issue its more about the multi Billion dollar arms deals and propping up Israel
2256 2018-11-20 21:12:47 U get oil on top dat ur head
2257 2018-11-20 21:12:38 The #orangutans could be extinct within a generation >> destructive #palmoil companies like @Indofood are to blame. RT to tell members of palm oil certification org @RSPOtweets to commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO
2258 2018-11-20 21:12:31 I wish people would stop convincing themselves they’re being environmentally responsible by avoiding palm oil & not using straws when they’re still eating meat three times a day !!!!!
2259 2018-11-20 21:12:30 Psst.... Don't shout oil market ROUT when going through them 
2260 2018-11-20 21:12:30 #BREAKING: President Trump defends his decision to maintain business ties with Saudi Arabia, saying "It's America first to me," and cutting off ties would cost hundreds of billions of dollars in arms deals and oil prices would go up. #OANN
2261 2018-11-20 21:12:19 Do you really think one man has that kind of authority and not the the 40 oil companies in the Middle East?
 Do you really believe that because we stop selling to a country that accounts to a bit over 10% of our gas prices will double?
You sir, need to stop believing a liar.
2262 2018-11-20 21:12:18 So if it was a joke, then you agree that tyranny can occur anywhere, yes?

Could you point out a tyranny from history which had armed subjects?

(No, you cannot, because an armed populace and tyranny are like oil and water... they cannot mix).

2265 2018-11-20 21:12:10 "It's all about America über alles."

Blood and moral depravity openly tolerated for money and oil.  Opportunism as guide to life.

2271 2018-11-20 21:11:34 Do you sell America oil?
Do you buy arms from America.?
For ever billion you spend in the U.S. we will give you a coupon to kill and dismember an American resident of your choice.
Russia, poison who you’d like.
Saudi, get out the sawzalls and have at it!

2272 2018-11-20 21:11:28 Coffee my wife bought me says on its instructions to add butter and something called, “Brain Octane Oil” How this product isn’t called, “Chads Coffee” is beyond me.
2273 2018-11-20 21:11:24 I’m really mocking the idea some have made that we have energy independence. Im not a fan of harsh actions but also not a fan of verbally tossing their salad because of oil prices.
2274 2018-11-20 21:11:23 We have begun painting a Butler's Pantry in Hingham. First coat of Fine Paints of Europe oil undercoater applied. Applied using HVLP. Color is Rembrandt Red. Will keep up progress photos. Final look will be high gloss fine paints of Europe hollandlac 98 in Rembrandt red!
2275 2018-11-20 21:11:19 'That money was then allegedly wired to a Russian bank, then to a Russian company that shipped the oil from Iran to Syria. Along the way, the Treasury Department claims that Russian ships would switch off their GPS tracking systems to conceal the origin of their cargo.'
2276 2018-11-20 21:11:18 Not having been their but took the time to follow Ms @VanessaBeeley and others who were there, I can only agree with Mr. @ShehabiFares. Take a look at the USA foreign policy and you will see that if a country has oil and are not handing it over the CIA will destabilise it.
2277 2018-11-20 21:11:15 As a Texan, I know that with oil at $80, or gasoline at $3, everyone prospers. With oil at $50 (gaso under $2), some prosper more, but lots of us go broke. Especially folks in Houston.
2278 2018-11-20 21:11:13 I am well educated Milo & like you I can scent the BS. You are nothing more than an opportunist taking advantage of any platform incl. the Fat-Man’s snake oil media to fund a war against the NWO (are you joking me?) All you care about is branding your Liberace theatre  persona
2279 2018-11-20 21:11:10 Ok he is definitely mentally impaired, this yutz makes up numbers on arms, jobs, oil, etc. It's no wonder he bankrupted his Casinos. Which I never understood since the House never loses.
2280 2018-11-20 21:11:10 I used butter instead of oil and Vietnamese cinnamon--which is sharper than standard cinnamon. And chopped walnuts, of course.
2281 2018-11-20 21:11:09 @realDonaldTrump drained the swamp of water, filled it with blood and oil #Kashoggi
2282 2018-11-20 21:11:09 @realDonaldTrump #SociopathBLOTUS overlooks clear human rights violation, making excuse that US needs Saudi oil/gas. The majority of US imports are from Canada. SA, Mexico, Venezuala, Iraq make up the next 4 in almost equal amounts.
#resign
2283 2018-11-20 21:11:07 Over 86% of US oil consumption is domestic this year & it is rising as a % going ahead. There’s a shale production glut. We can easily fill the stub demand with ex-Saudi UAE or Nigerian production.

There is no scarcity. Oil will keep falling. It won’t trade >$80/brl again.
2284 2018-11-20 21:10:58 The next time Trump talks about barrels of oil, some one needs to ask him for the price of gas!
2285 2018-11-20 21:10:54 We do refine here. That's the most ridiculous part of all of this. It's not a fix to low oil prices. And it's something we already do.
2286 2018-11-20 21:10:43 The only way for us to get off the teat of Saudi Arabia or any other rogue regime is to become 100% independent on our own oil and energy needs. Until then they have us by the balls. Yet mention drilling for more oil and everyone goes ape shit. Can’t have it both ways. 
2287 2018-11-20 21:10:30 "We support this brutal, totalitarian regime because they're using oil prices as extortion, and that's OK."

2290 2018-11-20 21:10:17 Maybe this is a sign not to invest in the oil industry any further. #ClimateChangeIsReal
2291 2018-11-20 21:10:12 Today the so called president, stood in front of reporters and said that the saudis are keeping the price of oil low for him! 
He gave them a Legal US resident to murder and in return they are lining his pockets and keeping the price of oil low to keep his
2292 2018-11-20 21:10:08 Easy peasy. Not supply us with cheap oil.
2293 2018-11-20 21:10:06 The first is about completely replacing animal fats in people with recent coronary problems with fats high in omega 6 linoleic acid. I’m not sure I get the relevance here. The second is about olive oil used for frying compared to other oils. I also don’t understand the relevance.

2296 2018-11-20 21:09:54 Usually bear market they will tell you keep buying. Bull market everyone screaming stay out stay out bear market ahead. Looks like a sect bear market through home sales and oil as well as tech blah blah blah play the stocks not the market
2297 2018-11-20 21:09:53 To do so would grant China or Russia the Saudi's multi billion dollar military contract & raise crude oil prices to further destroy OUR economy &  global position. That can not happen.
2298 2018-11-20 21:09:50 @Jacobs_IRL Can you tell me where the palm oil used in your products is sourced, ie are you sure it is from sustainable plantations and not from rainforest felling?
2299 2018-11-20 21:09:48 OPEC head: "What we have to deal with is, No. 1, the oil industry is driven more by sentiment and by financial markets than it is by fundamentals." Fundamentals may matter, but that could be well after we are stopped out.

2301 2018-11-20 21:09:41 Khashoggi had his own problems. Let The Saudi’s  cut off the oil supply to the U.S. if the President reacts adversely . I bet you all would then bitch about that.
2302 2018-11-20 21:09:41 Well I suppose it depends on if oil prices have gone up or down  the stupidest part is that the lower the oil prices get fewer of his “big beautiful pipelines” are built.

2308 2018-11-20 21:09:10 Kenya govt buys maize to insulate consumers and farmers. The Ethiopian govt is the sole importer of rice, fuel, sugar and cooking oil, again to protect households. In the US the govt and farmers have a relationship called subsidies. Did we invent economic liberalism?
2309 2018-11-20 21:09:09 I am suffering with my sore joints today. Am hoping that CBD oil will help. Have ordered some online.
2310 2018-11-20 21:09:05 99.99% of crude oil traders do not know how crude oil is traded.
2311 2018-11-20 21:09:05 I won’t accept this til you can take cod liver oil straight no flinching (the liquid not the capsule)
2312 2018-11-20 21:09:02 Good thing Trump turned loose our Oil Industry, otherwise, pissing off the Saudis would have cost us $4.00 gasoline.  Technology will render Oil irrelevant in 20 years and the Arabs will go back to the Middle Ages.
2313 2018-11-20 21:09:02 There must surely be. I suspect he typed it late at night with just his secretary there, and ordered the person to press enter.
I have never read anything like it coming from an official source. All it says is “Oil costs money but I kept it low for you guys” and “America first”
2314 2018-11-20 21:09:00 '....& that's how you get free air' 
"I would have got a free oil change"

2315 2018-11-20 21:08:58 "Low oil prices"?
He "kept them down"??

Where?!
I've been getting charged $1.50+ more per gallon for over a year: cheapest gas around here is $3.49/per gallon.

I hate paying these prices, but, I will gladly pay 10 bucks a gallon, or more, if it means #JusticeForJamalKhashoggi
2316 2018-11-20 21:08:58 @realDonaldTrump aka Cadet bone spurs, cowards to Putin who messed with our elections, gets played by Rocket man, and now allows Saudi Arabia to murder a journalist because he doesn’t want oil prices to go up. What a fucken disgrace! #FuckTrump
2317 2018-11-20 21:08:56 When granite slabs or tiles are optimally sealed, cooking oil or salad dressing can simply be wiped off. A good seal will not allow fluids and other substances to penetrate the stone.
2318 2018-11-20 21:08:54 Like it mate. Are you long oil too?
2319 2018-11-20 21:08:53 If you couldn’t get Nigeria to work with major oil windfall, when you spent 16 years with nothing to your for it, but your slogan is getting Nigeria to work again. Did you ever get it working  these people are clowns 
2320 2018-11-20 21:08:50 @realDonaldTrump So, basically you're going to let murder slide because #SaudiArabia has money, same reason they are our "allies".  #Oil #money
2321 2018-11-20 21:08:49 @realDonaldTrump you just sold our country to Saudi Arabia.  If you say we will lose jobs and increased oil prices, then you said they own us.  #Saudi_Arabia #mbs #MBS_murderer
2322 2018-11-20 21:08:35 Every time I get my oil changed, I think they are gonna tell me so much is wrong with my car but I just over think
2323 2018-11-20 21:08:33 Suggest also some trendy woo - oil or oregano, elderflower syrup, etc.

2327 2018-11-20 21:08:18 Being a female model must be so weird. Like   mid photo shoot  "ok hold that thought, I need to oil my ass up real quick"
2328 2018-11-20 21:08:15 I understand that...However, the emails haven't been verified to be classified or not so saying they aren't, is a little premature. My problem is the use of "Fake news".. Trump is caught, it's fake news. He's a snake oil salesman that has bamboozled most of America..
2329 2018-11-20 21:08:07 Deep-fat frying causes changes to the composition of oils. The content of polyunsaturated fats decreases while frying time or temperature is increased. This was most evident in soybean oil with 79% fewer trienoic fatty acids after frying @UofGFoodProf #Food2150 #Tyagi #Assignment
2330 2018-11-20 21:07:55 @POTUS  You are a sad excuse for a man, you continue to let this country down and now you can't even stand up for man who was brutally murdered. Is money and oil that important to you that you'll turn your back on everyone
2331 2018-11-20 21:07:55 The brown paper towels from restrooms is the best material to remove excess oil from your face.
2332 2018-11-20 21:07:49 .@POTUS #TRUMP just invited other countries to kidnap, torture & kill us, without consequence, as long as there’s money to be made. He just told the world  the price of oil trumps human life. 
@realDonaldTrump #MAGA? Not at all. He just sold us to the highest bidder. 
#UnAmerican
2333 2018-11-20 21:07:44 One of my lovely lady friends, many years ago, was stuck in a similar situation. She announced, rather loudly, that oil leaks (apparently the men's topic of choice) was much like her incredibly heavy menstrual flow. The guys stopped chatting, and the queue got moving again.
2334 2018-11-20 21:07:40 "America First" coined by David Duke means sacrificing an American to appease a foreign country for oil and weapons
2335 2018-11-20 21:07:38 yall i just bought vitamin e oil bc i heard it was good for your skin but idk how to use it exactly, do you mix it with smth else then apply it or just use it directly?
2336 2018-11-20 21:07:37 your chin is from hormones & greasy food. the nose & brows are from bacteria. so start using a cleanser twice a day paired with a toner. also switch to water based moisturizers instead of creams or oil based.
2337 2018-11-20 21:07:32 Saudi are a "client state"....Money and oil ensures "protection". Keep paying the Mafia and all the problems disappear...
2338 2018-11-20 21:07:31 We dont though. Canada had enough, its way cheaper at 14bl than Saudi oil
2339 2018-11-20 21:07:30 We've never had a red line with the Saudi's. Gotta keep that (supposed) cheap gas flowing even though we're the largest exporter of oil.
2340 2018-11-20 21:07:27 I love this and you! I can definitely feel SAD creeping in, will think about taking fish oil again
2341 2018-11-20 21:07:26 If your patio decking will get though winter without that coat of decking oil you saw cheap in B&M ?
2342 2018-11-20 21:07:24 It also makes no sense economically. Whether or not we have an alliance or special relationship with the Saudis, they will still pump and sell oil. The supply will not change and the price will be unaffected.
2343 2018-11-20 21:07:13 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO

2345 2018-11-20 21:07:10 The last paragraph sums it up. This was all for oil, as with everything we've done for the last 30 years.
2346 2018-11-20 21:07:10 disgraceful, blood for oil now? step down. you cant even lie on tv i could see you felt uncomfortable saying it.
2347 2018-11-20 21:07:09 Each time he speaks about sales to The Saudis, the amount increases and the number jobs increase. He just claimed that oil prices are lower because of him, but oil prices were lower when he took office. He is so annoyingly full of Hot Air!

2352 2018-11-20 21:06:53 Trump want lower interest from FED and lower $oil price, with the heavy sell off in stocks and drop in oil price US economy is getting weaker and FED can lower. It's the mad game.
2353 2018-11-20 21:06:50 U should study Petroleum Economics before you talk shit. The world would get crushed with $150 oil and thats where it would be without Trump
2354 2018-11-20 21:06:49 Why oil stocks and technology stocks falling? 
Think think think....OUR PRESIDENT IS @realDonaldTrump and everything will be fine because the globalists are FREAKING OUT! WE ARE WITNESSING #MAGA #AMERICAFIRST 
TRUST AND BELIEVE OUR @POTUS!!!
2355 2018-11-20 21:06:47 Y'all have the audacity to ask for a cheaper price when there's females out here sucking dick for an oil change.
2356 2018-11-20 21:06:47 So @FurFest will there be spare oil from the biplanes to light the menorah for the first night of Chanukah after the con is over? =3
2357 2018-11-20 21:06:45 Um Charles, how is Canada any different? We continue to sell them arms & buy their oil. Trudeau said he didn’t want to jeopardize “billions of $” with Saudis. Hard to maintain the moral high ground with Cr Prince Bonesaw or Trump. We’re hypocrites.
2358 2018-11-20 21:06:41 He's apparently pardoning Saudi Arabia too. They are allowed to torture and murder a journalist who was living in the US just because they are keeping oil prices down and have signed a $14.5 billion contract with us? As the President often says WHAT A DISGRACE!!!!!
2359 2018-11-20 21:06:41 You’ve just noticed  I remember the oil bulls from $26 when it was 45. The biggest financial cycle are the big crashes 1920’s etcbefore it was up and then it went down and then it went up. Why should aim shares be different  due the type of market that can be zero or delist

2362 2018-11-20 21:06:17 Oil prices have dropped 20% in the last month. Why then is heating oil more expensive that ever?
2363 2018-11-20 21:06:16 oil is more important than a conscience i guess
2364 2018-11-20 21:06:02 Hmmm, so you are telling me an oil kingdom has us by the balls because of our reliance on oil? Oh, whatever could we do about that? 

But all the Republicans keep telling us climate change is a hoax and we can’t invest in alternative energy because our economy will collapse.
2365 2018-11-20 21:05:55 As someone who has worked on building sites and oil refineries in deepest darkest West Wales, I can only concur. Half of them can't spell immigration, but they're definitely against it...
2366 2018-11-20 21:05:55 @DarraldC Funny the same people that are complaining about the Saudis are the same people that will scream at 150.00 a barrel oil!! Ill take America first and watching oil fall another 6.6% today.
2367 2018-11-20 21:05:54 おはようございます
自分もよーくありますので
2368 2018-11-20 21:05:54 Did you just see the Press Co from this disgrace of a president. what a disgrace. a man was cut up in to pieces.and this racist fool is talking about oil prices.2 years can not get here fast enough! that's if we have a country by then.this fool may end up getting us all killed.
2369 2018-11-20 21:05:53 Oil for sure, but from the high in the S&P 500 on Sept 21 the 10 year is unch. Clearly risk parity isn't working like it used to.
2370 2018-11-20 21:05:40 Alberta has oil ...
2371 2018-11-20 21:05:37 356$ for some brakes & a oil change ..... I’m sick !!!!!!
2372 2018-11-20 21:05:36 I’m not going to bother to try relax, impossible for me hah, and you too, clary sage oil is good to bath in, apparently not until full term but can help speed up when labour happens
2373 2018-11-20 21:05:34 Stop selling us oil? Stop spending money at Trump properties?
2374 2018-11-20 21:05:32 Trump thinks it's okay to let the Saudis torture and murder an American journalist because they're keeping oil prices low.

How can anyone who claims to be a good person still support this man?
2375 2018-11-20 21:05:26 YES I am. Labour & Tories fom LONDON HQs shafted us over the Oil & Devolution. They work for Westminster NOT Scotland!
2376 2018-11-20 21:05:26 When you are way overdue for an oil change and you know the mechanic is going to come lecture you when they are done. I feel like I am in the principal’s office. #badcarowner #singlemomlife #workingmom #dancemom #cheermom #busykids #busymom #toomanyhashtags
2377 2018-11-20 21:05:23 His lack of human rights values is astounding. If he had been abducted and cut up into pieces would life go on as usual? How do you place one life more valuable than another. And is human life more valuable than oil? According to Trump, it is not.
2378 2018-11-20 21:05:23 they were the best suited applicants. It were the people that wrote the articles about it that put the spotlight on their gender and phrased it like they were only hired for being female. I think the media actually tries to pour oil into the fire whereever they can.
2379 2018-11-20 21:05:16 Seeing as the Cantu is basically both Liquid and Cream, does applying Oil after that count as L-C-O?
2380 2018-11-20 21:05:15 @marcorubio @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @SenThomTillis @SenTomCotton @SenSasse - Waiting for “Pro-Life” “Patriots” to speak up about the value of Kashoggi’s life (oil prices and arms sales? -maybe $40 mil in Trump tower).  when did Saudi become a better source than our own CIA??!! #
2381 2018-11-20 21:05:11 Funny how my whole line of practice since post call to bar has been either Oil & gas or Shipping Admiralty (maybe God is talking to me) + i remember i had like 4months break of law & i realized marketing wasnt for me. AT ALL. #Totaldisaster
2382 2018-11-20 21:05:10 Really think about this! It’s acceptable for the leader of the free world to do F’all about a murdered man. Because they are the biggest arms buyer - surprised USA haven’t invaded Saudi Arabia already. Plenty of Oil FYI #LAUGHABLE
2383 2018-11-20 21:05:09 I don’t care about any money or oil from Saudi Arabia??  I care about human rights.   This president does not care about America’s people or our interest.  All he cares about is money.  Horrified!!!  WTF @GOP   GET OFF YOUR ASSES!!
2384 2018-11-20 21:05:05 Always used olive oil here.
2385 2018-11-20 21:05:01 That Oil 
2386 2018-11-20 21:05:00 Con la ostia hoy del #oil mañana a sufrir le toca
2387 2018-11-20 21:04:57 Listening to #trump   he's so up himself!
@POTUS will overlook the #Khashoggi affair & hence #HumanRights just to keep the #armsdeals & jobs &amp; oil price low! So that's what #AmericaFirst means? Anything is ok?
As for person of the year? "Can you imagine it not being a trump?"
2388 2018-11-20 21:04:48 First of all, I didn’t vote for trump, but you have absolutely no idea of what you’re talking about the saudis have us bent over an oil barrel look how Obama paid off Iran, what was it $430 million flown in in the middle of the night? All in Swiss franks, gold etc...
2389 2018-11-20 21:04:46 It’s definitely the new oil irritating me smh
2390 2018-11-20 21:04:43 Money - weapons - oil - Israel
2391 2018-11-20 21:04:43 いやマジで首いってえなどうした？私何かしたか？
2392 2018-11-20 21:04:41 How many gallons of ground nut oil did u pour
2393 2018-11-20 21:04:41 "They've got us over a barrel with these oil prices. They control us, basically, if you want to know the truth of it. That's why I'm proud to stand by them, all journalist murders aside."
2394 2018-11-20 21:04:29 You could write to them and ask them to only use accredited sustainable sources of palm oil in their product
2395 2018-11-20 21:04:14 So my client, who’s a midwife said about an oil that really helps bring it on they use it in hospitals in early stages of labour but I can’t for the life of me remember what it was! Been really relaxed helps too apparently  so that’s not gonna work haha
2396 2018-11-20 21:04:07 Libraries are constantly removing books to make room for new ones. The annual Seattle public library oil sale was a bigger holiday at my house growing up than thanksgiving.
2397 2018-11-20 21:04:02 I think translated that means "as long as we can sell our arms, and get oil, we don't give a damn".
2398 2018-11-20 21:03:59 Take out Saudi Arabia the oil price would go through the floor yes you'd disrupt the over inflated world economy based on the petro dollar
2399 2018-11-20 21:03:58 Oil prices have been falling since the president jumped on Opec.
2400 2018-11-20 21:03:58 Sunday a lady at the restaurant spilled oil on me/my hair. today someone spilled hot coffee on my pants/jacket  whyyyyyyyyyyyy
2401 2018-11-20 21:03:55 He had a point about the oil prices
2402 2018-11-20 21:03:54 Lotion don’t work for me, I need body oil or cream
2403 2018-11-20 21:03:54 No one ever does. Oil is valued far more highly than human life by this American president. Are the rest of us supposed to be afraid of the veiled threat?
2404 2018-11-20 21:03:53 That's what you get for using oil money to cover for more and more federal bond sales. Fix the debt, get rid of Saudi.
2405 2018-11-20 21:03:52 Define irony. Oklahoma voted overwhelmingly for Trump. Oil and gas is our #1. He just vowed to do everything possible to suppress o&g prices.
2406 2018-11-20 21:03:51 GREEN FRIDAY SALE HAPPENING THIS FRIDAY! 35% OFF STORE WIDE, 50% off WHITE LABEL AND SELECT OIL CARTIDGES!

2409 2018-11-20 21:03:44 .@POTUS #TRUMP just stood on the WH lawn and told the world that the price of oil is more important than human lives. 
@realDonaldTrump #MAGA? No. He just put a price on all our heads, telling the world he won’t hold any nation accountable if they torture & kill any one of us.
2410 2018-11-20 21:03:43 Hi @CadburyUK How’s your palm oil? The sustainable kind? Or the Evil-Man-ruthlessly-destroys-planet kind? Please make it the former. I have two children under five so I can promise to keep you in business.
2411 2018-11-20 21:03:37 What if it had been a white, US serviceman they killed? I’m trying to figure out if it’s racism or if there is a calculation he’s done in his head how many people killed it would take to have more expensive oil? Which btw, we could reduce our need for.
2412 2018-11-20 21:03:34 America held hostage by foreign royalty?
Why did you bother with independence in the first place?
Does America first mean oil and military industrial complex interests first?
2413 2018-11-20 21:03:33 Trump says oil prices going down, I thought they were going up?
2414 2018-11-20 21:03:32 are you willing 2 pay a lot more 4 gas when Saudi takes the oil we use from them away. that is what is going to happen if we fight Saudi Arabia and worse. one day we might fight them being tired of their abuse but Trump is trying to not destabilize the middle east more than it is
2415 2018-11-20 21:03:31 Standard Oil was run by saints when compared to the Amazons and Googles of today.
2416 2018-11-20 21:03:27 Unplugging, rubbing lavender essential oil on the soles of my feet and focused breath work are my favorite “sleep aids”.
2417 2018-11-20 21:03:19 The USA not only policing the world also the Arabs must buy arms for cheap oil or will be set up in the war, and that is also a choice they have.

2421 2018-11-20 21:03:09 A green new deal means not having to rely on their bloody oil anymore, better for everyone
2422 2018-11-20 21:03:09 Uh huh. Saudi Arabia can kill whomever they want as long as the U.S. gets their oil.
2423 2018-11-20 21:03:08 Thought previous @Whitehouse administrations worked hard to reduce foreign oil dependence? How is it that (arms) deals w/Saudis all of a sudden affect US gas prices, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump? #MAGA #FoxNews #Hannity #CNN #TheLead #FoxAndFriends
2424 2018-11-20 21:03:08 Oil fever!
2425 2018-11-20 21:03:02 Now we have a President who is addicted to being on the Rally circuit. I can't help but wonder if he's going to turn the 3-4 days he works now to 2-3? Will he just become a snake oil salesman and go from town to town talking about how GREAT HE IS? What will make him stop?
2426 2018-11-20 21:02:57 Could be the excessive oil. Dad uses canola oil, not sure if that makes a difference, but the eggs come out so fluffy.
2427 2018-11-20 21:02:54 Oil is thicker than blood.
2428 2018-11-20 21:02:49 My American dream is to be financially secure enough to get an oil change every 6 months
2429 2018-11-20 21:02:49 El jefe de seguridad del oviedo a la puta calle .un poco tarde pero tambien me vale .Ala a tomar oil culo pa el piles hijo de puta
2430 2018-11-20 21:02:48 Imagine how cheap oil would be if he worked with Iran?
2431 2018-11-20 21:02:41 Yes but what if I don't like the strong flavor? -sigh. :(  Is Avocado oil or Grapeseed oil a good substitute?
2432 2018-11-20 21:02:41 So he is saying, then, that the Saudis can kill any number of people they wish, so long as they lower the price of oil.
2433 2018-11-20 21:02:39 He could have instead used one of the many photo to hand-painted oil on canvas businesses advertised on the Web. Cost would have been $500 to $600.
2434 2018-11-20 21:02:36 Obviously if we want and NEED their oil we must remain friends and trading partners.  Wake up liberals !!
2435 2018-11-20 21:02:35 I just love and adore this almond body oil from @LOCCITANE_UK

2442 2018-11-20 21:02:19 Yeah I'm obviously being a little bit snarky about arugula. I'm not a big fan, obviously, but it does have its place when used the right way. 

Truffle oil is a cheat, though -- truffle oil would make a dog turd delicious.
2443 2018-11-20 21:02:18 Guess it's ok with you if Saudi Arabia cuts us off from importing oil from them due to all the CHILD TRAFFICKING AND MURDER committed around the world by the Clintons...

2445 2018-11-20 21:02:06 Oil Prices Tumble Further After Trump Saudi Arabia Comments

U.S. oil prices slid further after Trump’s comments about standing with Saudi Arabia. Crude prices dropped earlier toward the one-year low reached last week as a selloff on Wall Street sparked broader risk aversion.
2446 2018-11-20 21:02:02 (It’s used to mean ‘not deep frying’, ie minimal oil)

2454 2018-11-20 21:01:40 And Now @realDonaldTrump says I

“I have no business w/Saudi Arabia”

This man is a National Disgrace

The biggest hit 2 oil prices is BREAKING the Iran multi-national treaty that allies, & Russia still honor

This man didn’t say a single truthful thing on the lawn today

2457 2018-11-20 21:01:26 Wikipedia isn't a credible scientific source.  

The U.S.  Energy Information Administration:  crude oil accounted for 79% of the petroleum imported in 2017.

Saudi Arabia is your 2nd biggest and most independent import source (9%).  You export petroleum to Canada but not SA.

2461 2018-11-20 21:01:16 Dems want to tank Trump and what better way but bring down the market.  Dems in House want sanctions on Saudi Arabia. Oil prices?  Our economy is strong don’t believe pundits.

2486 2018-11-20 20:59:39 Old enough to remember Saudis recent intentional oil war  overproduction to shut down US production gains from technology costing approximately 60K US jobs.  Not sure Trump is right that Saudi oil at $50 is so friendly.  Is it @scottlincicome?

2494 2018-11-20 20:59:07 today's yoga instructor brought around an essential oil blend she made called "bitch get out the way" & also quoted "a wise woman named rupi kaur"
2495 2018-11-20 20:59:06 Started to use OUAI Hair Oil tonight and I swear to God if there’s one bit of frizz in my hair tomorrow I’ll wreck the place.
2496 2018-11-20 20:59:01 President Trump says he supports Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the public roads in the name of Big Tech collusion.  Feigns misdirection involving oil.  America stands on a dangerous precipice of tyrannic elite rule.  #politics
2497 2018-11-20 20:58:51 Trump: it's the oil, stupid #OOTT
2498 2018-11-20 20:58:48 So castor oil did not work but only gave me some contractions that started at 10pm till 4 in the morning  oh and I threw up once and it was nasty  I’m currently 2 centimeters 70 % effaced and I’m thin

2500 2018-11-20 20:58:43 #potus just endorsed #racist @cindyhydesmith in his little presser.  It's like watching a 7-yr old try to lie his way out of the principal's office.  Billions and billions from #SaudiArabia low oil prices, fist fights in #Tijuana and #ivankaemails My head hurts @SRuhle
2501 2018-11-20 20:58:42 Pwede bang maligo ng efficascent oil??????? HAHAHAHAHA
2502 2018-11-20 20:58:28 Will adding essential oils to the DIY nail oil affect the product?
2503 2018-11-20 20:58:27 Trump only care about is oil and money.
2504 2018-11-20 20:58:26 Add a bit of soy sauce a little oil and onions and pepper than stir fry for like 2min. Fixes even the worst brands
2505 2018-11-20 20:58:26 Then you've certainly had arugula used in many acceptable and delicious ways. From simple salad w/ shaved Asiago and a little truffle oil, to burger (or better, roast beef) topping. In short, Arugula is not to be dissed.

I agree with you on kale. But Romaine has it's place too.
2506 2018-11-20 20:58:23 oil cleaner + cosrx low ph cleanser + cosrx aha bha toner + cosrx aha every few days + the ordinary marine hyaluronics + the ordinary rosehip oil + cosrx ultra moisturizing lotion and now i started using the origins drink up intensive sleeping mask.
2507 2018-11-20 20:58:22 I just accidentally poured an eighth of my Samhain  black phoenix alchemy oil into the diffuser.
2508 2018-11-20 20:58:20 Holiday: If you pan fry any of the Turkey organs, add a little olive oil to the pan to make it easier to scrape them into the garbage.
2509 2018-11-20 20:58:16 #oott i was very curious what is general act of crude on thanksgiving day... my memory just enough i will work on it tonight #crudeoil #usoil #oil Happy Thanksgiving!
2510 2018-11-20 20:58:13 This might have been the best day *for me* to get the oil changed and the tires rotated, but it surely ain't the best day to have it done.
2511 2018-11-20 20:58:12 for some reason, the chinese egg and tomato is so much better than regular eggs and tomatoes and i haven't been able to figure out why. mb it's the excessive oil??
2512 2018-11-20 20:58:09 Run out of oil.
2513 2018-11-20 20:58:05 I use the Moroccan oil one every once in awhile just for the smell lol but that gets pricey too
2514 2018-11-20 20:57:59 Hahaha, no doubt. We produce a lot of oil too. Oh well.
2515 2018-11-20 20:57:57 Nah, Americans don’t like seeing our President excuse brutal murder of an American resident because of oil prices. That’s what being a #sellout is! #KhashoggiMurder
2516 2018-11-20 20:57:45 I remember Lee Iacocca commented on this like ten years ago. Basically, he said that America had sold it's soul for oil, and gave a long list of reasons why he believed that.
2517 2018-11-20 20:57:38 Trump says: 
1. he has no personal business wi/Saudi Arabia 
2. the Saudis are buying $400mil in military weapons;  we would lose hundreds of thousands of jobs
3. do you want to see oil prices go to $150/barrel?
4. this is about 'Make America Great Again' and 'America First'
2518 2018-11-20 20:57:36 There's blood on the street from #Stocks to #Oil and #Crypto , opportunities may be abundant when the smoke clears , look at the fundamentals
2519 2018-11-20 20:57:34 oil e mero detalhe
2520 2018-11-20 20:57:33 And which party do you think Putin would prefer to have in power?
I'm thinking the party who landlocks our oil and gas and has a weak leader with fancy socks.
2521 2018-11-20 20:57:31 Stop the oil and gas industry working in the Middle East. We pay for their protection.
2522 2018-11-20 20:57:28 I leave for vacay tomorrow and I've got 12 loads of laundry, dishes to do, a house to clean, and need an oil change and I just spent the last 3 hours playing uno at my husbands shop... why am I like this?
2523 2018-11-20 20:57:28 I’m out of baby oil
2524 2018-11-20 20:57:21 Oil a eu de la chance tu veux dire qu'il est bon
2525 2018-11-20 20:57:19 I tried all tea tree oil but that made it worse 
2526 2018-11-20 20:57:13 Wrong! Do you honestly think nothing is being done? How about remembering that President Trump keeps his word. This time he's just being quiet. Sanctions are being put in place. You don't start a war with the richest oil producers in the world over a reporter.
2527 2018-11-20 20:57:13 Oil was lower when Obama was President!  He just don’t want to hurt his family business!  #TRADOR
2528 2018-11-20 20:57:09 The President’s priorities are:
 Global oil trade
 Arms deals
 Iran

Is this 2018 or is it 1979? #maga
2529 2018-11-20 20:57:08 I need an oil change  Cheap place to go to??? Lmao I dont want to bother my dad to do one haha
2530 2018-11-20 20:57:07 Trump: If U.S. Were to Break With Saudi Arabia, 'Your Oil Prices Would Go Through the Roof' #OOTT #Saudi
2531 2018-11-20 20:57:04 Dumb question my love, is there such thing as beef oil?
2532 2018-11-20 20:57:04 It will come back... Oil took a hit..GOOD!!!!... Gas will come down. Apple... Fuck apple
2533 2018-11-20 20:57:01 onions lettuce tomato oil vinegar and spices #JMSweepstakes
2534 2018-11-20 20:56:56 drop in oil from $86 brent ist week oct to today threatening $62

huge impact oil majors
eg. bp break even circa $53 ( ft 12mthsago) possibly sub $50 today
huge impact cash generation 

good for oil importers emerging mkts , china india 

@truemagic68 

economic cpi /bank rates
2535 2018-11-20 20:56:55 American oil/gas production increasing. If you know anything about the Russian economy, it’s dependent on oil. Low oil prices hurts them in many ways. Oh, and Angela Merkel gave in and will buy more American oil/gas. 

Not good for Russia.
2536 2018-11-20 20:56:42 Just in: President Trump defended his position on Saudi Arabia to reporters today, saying “It’s America First to me,” and that he wanted to preserve the arms sales –– and if the US broke with Saudi Arabia, oil prices would go up.
2537 2018-11-20 20:56:40 *Elected politicians feverishly contacting oil execs after a spill*

Well... What should we say?
2538 2018-11-20 20:56:36 Why does England need Scotland to be a part of IT’s club anyway. Talk about autonomy. Scotland never voted to leave the EU . NI never voted to leave the EU . If you get to be free why shouldn’t Scotland . The Scots will do alright with their Whisky , oil and fishing waters !
2539 2018-11-20 20:56:34 If fascistic geopolitical syndicates can get away with killing 1000s of people by flying planes into buildings in an effort to justify killing a million more to control oil supplies, impose global surveillance laws to hunt dissidents, it can get away with killing journalists too.
2540 2018-11-20 20:56:28 Did you do an oil or acrylic wash on this ?
2541 2018-11-20 20:56:27 There has never been a Shia terrorist. The Sunni Muslim Saudis are the reason radical Islam exists, not Iranians, who aren't even Arab. Why is Iran worse than Saudi Arabia. The Saudis literally admitted to having a hand in 9/11, and the US just doesn't care because of oil $$$
2542 2018-11-20 20:56:22 We just sold our soul for cheap oil, military contracts, and Trump apartment sales/hotel revenues.
2543 2018-11-20 20:56:19 Saudi oil prices & personal Trump business deals > Any one human life. America first but definitely not Americans first.
2544 2018-11-20 20:56:18 Buy Buy Buy Canadian oil!
 Not Bye Bye Bye Canadian oil!
2545 2018-11-20 20:56:16 #ukog On shore wells are the only way to make profit in oil and gas . at only 17$ - 20$ costs per barrel. The oil price being lower will cause major problems for the expensive producers . OPEC will cut production or face getting wiped out by America shale watch that space.
2546 2018-11-20 20:56:12 Jikijiki their sons get oil deals... Kudlaliwe ngathi, enough!
2547 2018-11-20 20:56:11 You know if the earth gets too warm we won't get any crops right? 

It's also good to have alternative fuels like bio diesel in the event we lose oil imports. 

At least until the Solar + Nuclear future.
2548 2018-11-20 20:56:08 Oil plunge
Our gasoline and heating fuel prices show a different direction 

2549 2018-11-20 20:56:07 But oil prices are low, so murder is okay, so says the @realDonaldTrump
2550 2018-11-20 20:56:06 Get sum beard oil bruh
2551 2018-11-20 20:56:04 prays for youuuu ;; o ;; hydrocortisone can lessen the severity of the rashes but if you want moisture mayhaps try coconut oil/shea butter? bc those are super heavy duty
2552 2018-11-20 20:55:56 Trump, falsely:  "They've worked with us very well.  We've kept oil prices down.  If you want to see oil prices go to $150 a barrel...all you've got to do is break up our relationship with Saudi Arabia".
2553 2018-11-20 20:55:52 The amount of oil we get from them isn't the main point, when all oil is backed by the US Dollar.
2554 2018-11-20 20:55:49 In late 2000, Saddam Hussein planned sell oil & to hold Iraq’s foreign currency reserves in Euros, not dollars. Iraq was under severe economic sanctions in the decade before the invasion of 2003. US leaders said the Iraq war would cost little becuz Iraq oil would pay for it.
2555 2018-11-20 20:55:45 It's not about Russia & China winning or oil prices, it's about integrity & being a leader, something @realDonaldTrump knows nothing about
2556 2018-11-20 20:55:43 Key is stock to flow ratio: Gold’s is 65x, oil is ~1.3x.  Like playing shell game w 65 shells v. 1.3 shells - phys fundamentals cannot separate fr paper prices for long w oil, can w gold
2557 2018-11-20 20:55:42 prez threatens that oil prices will go through the roof if he responds to MBS murdering #khashoggi.
2558 2018-11-20 20:55:42 @realDonaldTrump  you put politcs over what made our country great. Standing up for what is right and decent.   You are afraid to take a stand against Saudi because some idiots will blame you if oil prices go up.   Just like the way u avoided serving in viet to protect yourself
2559 2018-11-20 20:55:37 Trump on whether Saudi Crown Prince MBS was involved in the #KhashoggiMurder 

“Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t. The CIA have looked into this and they have nothing definitive...It’s about making America great again. It's about  America First..its about keeping oil prices down."

2561 2018-11-20 20:55:27 Gotta have the oil the bloodsoaked dictatorship is willing to sell ya! Plus the Saudis hate the Iranians, so...
2562 2018-11-20 20:55:25 “Sarah, does the president realize that when he talks about Saudi Arabia and oil prices he sounds EXACTLY like an organized criminal talking about a protection racket?”
2563 2018-11-20 20:55:23 1- we produce most of our own oil, 2- our economy is not that dependent on the Saudis, 3- you do not make moral decisions based solely on economics, doing the right thing is not always financially profitable. How is this man so weak and incompetent?
2564 2018-11-20 20:55:23 Lack of proper lubrication is why the Liberty Bell broke

It used to be a whole thing you soaked it with Liberty Oil and wrapped a rubber band around it overnight
2565 2018-11-20 20:55:20 So according to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, the Saudis control the oil prices in America & we're supposed to be happy about that? #MAGA #FoxNews #Hannity #CNN #TheLead #FoxAndFriends
2566 2018-11-20 20:55:19 but oil prices!?   #MorallyBankruptAmerica
2567 2018-11-20 20:55:16 My new oil diffuser is to cute 
2568 2018-11-20 20:55:14 It looked like 1 million bucks when it was done and it is just an oil no stain
2569 2018-11-20 20:55:14 On the bright side

Coconut oil smells so nice...
And the crepes I made this morning turned out really good! 
2570 2018-11-20 20:55:12 Trump live on the Saudi statement. Essentially, "Russia would love to sell them all the weapons," "If you want to see oil go up to $150 a barrel, Russia would love that."
2571 2018-11-20 20:55:07 So, there are 2 things which Trump views as more important than a human life:  money & oil.
2572 2018-11-20 20:54:49 Hopefully, someday we will be patriotic enough not to see the success of a few as success but a huge % of the nation. Sharing 5k to poor or 10k to traders is obnoxious! Media, tech, agric all need huge committed investment that in few can shift dependence on oil. #Nigeria
2573 2018-11-20 20:54:45 Oil money > American protection
2574 2018-11-20 20:54:45 Trumps talking oil USA relationship with Saudi Arabia is  over and it’s not even our choice That guys on the defense
2575 2018-11-20 20:54:44 These are illegal settlements under international law. The squatters should actually leave rather than stealing Palestinian land, water, oil and gas.
2576 2018-11-20 20:54:44 Trump takes credit for low oil prices. What a dumbass.
2577 2018-11-20 20:54:36 Crucial ally. The house of Saud subjected us to an oil embargo.The majority of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudi. Bin Laden was Saudi. Wahhabism was spread with Saudi money.We’re assisting the Saudis in a human rights holocaust in Yemen. But,they do a lot of business with us so...
2578 2018-11-20 20:54:35 And very little of our oil comes from the Saudis. But @realDonaldTrump is too stupid to know that.
2579 2018-11-20 20:54:32 He said KSA is Tremendous at Oil
2580 2018-11-20 20:54:22 Trump "would like to see oil prices lower" and he says, "abandoning Saudi Arabia would be a 'terrible mistake'" plus he'd "like to see lower interest rates". He will never admit that his tariff and tax extremes caused the market to fall dramatically. AP, Marketwatch
2581 2018-11-20 20:54:17 “being president has cost me a fortune,” he said, while trading blood for oil.
2582 2018-11-20 20:54:11 Oil yani petrol dünya ticaretinin azalacağını öngörerek sert düşüşler yaptı daha önce de, öncü sarsıntılar şeklinde.  Güvenli liman olur muyuz bilmem ki. Petrol şimdi de %7 ye yakın düşmüş görünüyor..
2583 2018-11-20 20:54:09 suddenly i’m “taking it too far” for suggesting “Wigs, Figs, and Oil rigs: An Evening of Wealth and Class” as the theme for friendsgiving
2584 2018-11-20 20:54:07 TBH, I am not sure what human rights concessions (if any) we got from S.A. (or Kuwait for that matter) for Desert Shield/Storm under GHWB. It was a just war for sure, but nobody pretended it was to make S.A. change that I am aware of. It restored the status quo & protected oil.
2585 2018-11-20 20:54:05 @realDonaldTrump just said that oil prices are as low as they've 'ever been' & to that I will say that gas is now $3/gal & I recall it being @ $1.89 in 2008 or @ $40/gal under Obama during the oil 'crash'. Once again it's being reported that the price of oil @ 53.30 is in an
2586 2018-11-20 20:54:00 The US has more than enough oil to cut out the Saudis, this is purely a pissing match with Iran.
2587 2018-11-20 20:53:55 45 thinks he controls the price of oil. 
2588 2018-11-20 20:53:52 Try being close to 7,000 miles since your last oil change. They aren’t too happy with guys at that point either.
2589 2018-11-20 20:53:47 Gas prices in LA are almost $5 in most places! They keep going up so I don’t know what oil deal he’s made!
2590 2018-11-20 20:53:44 Its really incredible that today a country can sanction the killing of someone and because money/oil is more important they get off scott free. I have no words to describe the hole humanity is digging and falling through.
2591 2018-11-20 20:53:42 UCP Leader Jason Kenney kicks off QP by asking about the oil differential.
Premier Notley calls the suggestions of putting all of the oil executives in a room and getting them to agree to turn off the taps is illegal.
Kenney accuses the premier of snickering.
2592 2018-11-20 20:53:39 Anyone shocked is living in denial.  Oil is cocaine for the US government
2593 2018-11-20 20:53:35 So is the PNW the only place not benefiting from falling oil prices at the pump? @GasBuddy
2594 2018-11-20 20:53:34 Jeeezus! To spend what had to be hours and hours on a ridiculous waste of good oil paints. Just bananas!
2595 2018-11-20 20:53:32 Focusing on sustainable palm oil misses the scale of the problem. At current market size, there is no such thing. For fuels — point of story is that petroleum is cleaner, no need to replace palm oil. But electricity is a lot cleaner.
2596 2018-11-20 20:53:28 My hunch is Hitchcock is gonna coach the Oil for a long time, if he’s healthy. The bar is just so low, surely they’ll be better than awful in the coming years.
2597 2018-11-20 20:53:25 I know. I’m far from a professional cook, but, I have a question. Wouldn’t any bacteria that is on the turkey be killed by the temperature of the oil? Just curious.
2598 2018-11-20 20:53:20 "We do not negotiate with terrorists.... except oil prices."
2599 2018-11-20 20:53:19 Jeremy and Keith have been irking me to get my headlight fixed but I’m soooooo lazy the only thing I make sure my car has is oil and gas lmao
2600 2018-11-20 20:53:15 @DanMandisShow 
Dan not only that the man said he would cut off the oil. I think trump is just protecting america. There is no reason why we should suffer for that man dying it was a bad thing but it would hurt our economy bad if trump santioned him.
2601 2018-11-20 20:53:08 When will we get Karl's Beard oil? Please name them after fish lol. Karl's Bass and Whiskers oil or Musk of Musky. I'd buy em. Just saying.
2602 2018-11-20 20:53:07 its not a marker of the UK economy..80 per cent of the money eanred by FTSE 100 companies is generated outsider the UK...the FTSE is falling because the mining stocks and the oil price are lower..
2603 2018-11-20 20:53:01 Possible alternate macro theme developing... Lower oil + global weakness = downside #inflation suprises ahead = lower #fed rate path? #markets
2604 2018-11-20 20:52:47 Trump is a coward who puts his own chances of relection and politics over the principles that made America great.    He cares more about how oil prices will affect his crazed followers than about the long term consequences of ab unethical policy.
2605 2018-11-20 20:52:45 Oh STFU. He is a scientist doing important international research and he has worked with oil industry and the Navy. He brings in his own funding to the tune of millions. You show your ignorance when you rail against academics. I’d bet my house he works harder than you do.
2606 2018-11-20 20:52:44 So, come on, 'proud Royal Navy veteran': tell us how much agent orange was dropped on the Malaya whose stolen wealth paid for the NHS. Tell us what Attlee's government did to the Iran that took back its own oil. Tell us about the Nakba; the partition of India; the Korean War...
2607 2018-11-20 20:52:36 And an end to the republican white Christian talking point that every life is precious. It’s not. Not up against Saudi oil
2608 2018-11-20 20:52:35 Oil > humans.
$ > humans.
Trump = Saudi Arabia.
2609 2018-11-20 20:52:32 Mmmm hmm..
As Chidi says, try L-C-O (with the Cream before the Oil).
It may work better for your hair texture.
2610 2018-11-20 20:52:31 So as a behavioral scientist does it make sense to sink the economy with $6/gal oil in exchange for taking a moral stance against a single immoral act?
2611 2018-11-20 20:52:30 Besides immoral is he really that dumb to believe Saudi Arabia will help to keep oil prices down or does he know that his followers will take in any BS he shovels out?
2612 2018-11-20 20:52:30 (I just learned something new about Zach Braff today)

My quotes for either:
"Do you know how much we spend on coconut oil?"
"I know you want to spice things up, but I don't know if my tongue can handle what you're asking for!"
"Ok nice, I was craving Asian tonight!"

2616 2018-11-20 20:52:14 Yeap, typical right-wing hypocrisy; Like Trump bringing up Saudi oil favors in his speech while he lowered supply and raised prices by cancelling Iran agreement.

2618 2018-11-20 20:52:11 Do not think low oil price can benefit US: considering 12mbbl Production and 11% of employment increase, its one of the most important industry of the country#OOTT
2619 2018-11-20 20:52:11 Snake oil salesman, Don the con.
2620 2018-11-20 20:52:10 Fun Fact: America gets the majority of its oil from America.
2621 2018-11-20 20:52:00 Oh no that should be absolutely fine! Get the oil! Two pumps for your hair but will last you a year! It goes a long way xxx
2622 2018-11-20 20:52:00 Its funny - alot of these videos, the ppl doing them all hate fracking.  So if you think this is some kinda oil industry scheme...I am not convinced.  They all seem to have the same contradiction I did towards it.  

That, and they have explained alot of my local experiences.
2623 2018-11-20 20:51:59 Trump citing military sales to Saudi Arabia and oil prices as excuses for not punishing MBS for murder of Khashoggi shows that he values money over human life. It also shows his ignorance about arms sales.
2624 2018-11-20 20:51:58 Stabilizing the region so immigrants don’t need to keep fleeing to Europe. A steady supply of oil. A resolution of the Palestinian issue.
2625 2018-11-20 20:51:51 US says it killed 37 militants in two Somalia airstrikes. SOMALIA HAS OIL? IS A SIN NOW TO BE RICH.
2626 2018-11-20 20:51:50 Trump trying to save Crown Prince against Europe and other side of deep America for sell weapons to get Saudis oil monies
2627 2018-11-20 20:51:47 @realDonladTrump says he's been "working very hard with Saudi Arabia to keep the price of oil down" because "America first". Doesn't that price American oil out of the market? And would that not make the US more dependent on foreign oil moving forward?
@KwikWarren
2628 2018-11-20 20:51:46 Ohhhh....Because we’re so embroiled it’s about more than oil? The MIC is also calling the shots? When I first learned we have companies like Boeing operating in Saudi...ugh.
2629 2018-11-20 20:51:46 How long until Trump forces Harold Hamm’s fat ass out in front of a camera to proclaim oil prices are great here and that we are dominating energy markets?
2630 2018-11-20 20:51:40 The catchy lyrics, "Bad buy, bad buy, what U going to do when nothing to invest into" seriously is showing itself today. Stocks down, oil down, gold down, bonds down, real estate down, banks down, futures down. As mentioned, holding large cash is hard & danger of instability. Hmm
2631 2018-11-20 20:51:35 Oil and Blues, thanks for playing, but the correct answer was Q.
2632 2018-11-20 20:51:33 Why the hell would a person  throw away oil colours just because he doesn't know what to do with them or how to use them , even tho they belong to someone else 
2633 2018-11-20 20:51:29 #trump cares more about oil prices and selling war ammo to the #Saudis then murder...trump needs to be removed from office #WhiteHouse
2634 2018-11-20 20:51:26 @NHLFlames how do I collect my winning motor oil from yesterday’s game?
2635 2018-11-20 20:51:23 The Nazis failed to take Russian or North African oil fields through insane decisions that wasted their troops, they also had a psychopathic idealogy, paranoir and hatred or greed as a drive for invasions, they were fighting against peoples fighting for their survival
2636 2018-11-20 20:51:22 Newfoundland oil spill: biologists fear scale of devastation may never be known | guardian
2637 2018-11-20 20:51:03 I sincerely hope you didn't get hurt today....my High Div and Div Growth Portfolios seem to have underperformed today no doubt due to oil so down @2.45%  ...a great buying opportunity will present itself at some point. As followers may know I've been raising cash for weeks now...
2638 2018-11-20 20:51:01 Really?  I think protecting the US from having an oil crisis is considered the national interest as opposed to his commercial interest.  But sure, advocate we pay $6/gal for gas and sink our economy just to make a statement about a journalist
2639 2018-11-20 20:50:56 Full Nazi and also full Terry Gilliam. The little animistic of the nun jumping off the cliff made me laugh out loud. Glad some of the oil billionaire dark money is funding accidental absurdist humor, even if it's also pushing "I can't believe it's not butter!" Nazi propaganda
2640 2018-11-20 20:50:50 1) Oil
2) They funded the terrorists that got us to let our government do whatever they feel like. [sorry for run-on]
3) Oil
2641 2018-11-20 20:50:44 "....killing people for oil."
2642 2018-11-20 20:50:39 Powerful Tumeric! See the many health benefits below! Oil absorbs much better than powder!
2643 2018-11-20 20:50:34 Trump himself just said that he values oil prices more than holding Saudi Arabia accountable. And he's screaming.
2644 2018-11-20 20:50:30 Please can someone feed me with real info about the renewal of these oil licences? And do you think these big men ( Nigeria CEOs) will let this happen this is Nigeria’s resources we are talking about yh? And this small number of people have been in control since forever
2645 2018-11-20 20:50:28 how do u get omega-3 fatty acids without taking fish oil bc i refuse
2646 2018-11-20 20:50:26 "We should invest in renewable energy, maybe solar"

Okay but then what will replace the adrenaline rush I get from watching oil prices go up and I suddenly can't afford groceries?? Let alone the thrill of rising oceans and more frequent and severe natural disasters?!?
2647 2018-11-20 20:50:22 Are they aware that Petro sells oil?
2648 2018-11-20 20:50:21 Do you mean, Luke, paper gold increases supply and suppresses price, whereas paper oil does not (we have a 60yr supply overhang in gold, supply can easily be price-settled, vast paper market not needed)
2649 2018-11-20 20:50:18 And from that point on you come to realize Climate Change is definitely not Co2!! 

From this pov, enter in the Oil Industry stuff (Rockefellers, Rosthchilds).  And it goes from there.
2650 2018-11-20 20:50:12 It was absolutely gorgeous, even though I say so for myself, but as I said used margarine instead of oil so light xx
2651 2018-11-20 20:50:04 Extremists like @Ocasio2018 have little concern for the thousands of working class men and women who's livelihoods depend upon the oil and gas industry. Sad!
2652 2018-11-20 20:50:01 Do y’all oil pull in the morning?
2653 2018-11-20 20:49:55 @realDonaldTrump you have turned a blind eye to the murder of a US National by a monopolistic oil power. You are a disgrace to the office you hold.

2657 2018-11-20 20:49:41 I appreciate the sentiment but you are quite literally asking oil companies to collude...and not tacitly; straight up visible collusion.  No doubt the world oil market is full of that and always has been (OPEC) but it kind of flies in the face of free market principles.
2658 2018-11-20 20:49:35 my mom was acting wack so i said i was gnna get her some cbd oil so she can chill and she said GOD IS MY CBD OIL i was like ok how abt u take some of that g o d oil then and stop acting so wack huh
2659 2018-11-20 20:49:35 Can’t believe we have reached this point.  Our president and his cult of personality are willing to sell their souls for money and oil.  So embarrassing.
2660 2018-11-20 20:49:32 anybody wanna go get my oil changed and tires rotated? I’ll pay for it, I just hate sitting in auto shops.
2661 2018-11-20 20:49:27 If Saudi Arabia decides to sell Oil in Euro instead of Dollar the whole world economy that depends on strong US Dollar will collapse.
2662 2018-11-20 20:49:20 Just a brief list of #trumps inane concocted lies that he pulled out his butt:

We need ID for buying cereal

Calls the ground “floor of forest”

Says Finland rakes floor of forests

Mass shooting in Sweden

Germany will be dependent on Russia for oil

WTF?!!!

2667 2018-11-20 20:49:04 CBD oil is a derivative of cannabis which has proven medical uses and help with pain, and is relaxing. It’s become legal here this month. I made a candle for a customer last week with palo santo and frankincense and was high for 6 hours 
2668 2018-11-20 20:49:04 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)

2670 2018-11-20 20:49:03 Or retrospectively now they could do a 2 month  ddi trial to prove statin absorption is NOT impacted by mineral oil. We know how risky a proposition that is! It cd validate/invalidate ReduceIT. $5b+ question !
2671 2018-11-20 20:48:57 It's a shame that Europe doesn't have any oil.
2672 2018-11-20 20:48:49 Imagine having a President who thinks it’s ok to murder journalists as long as oil prices stay low.
2673 2018-11-20 20:48:47 Diced , vegetable oil
2674 2018-11-20 20:48:46 Hope  the oil u use  to fry this   turkey   is the one dey  use to anoint David in the Bible
2675 2018-11-20 20:48:39 .@realDonaldTrump says if we abandon Saudi Arabia it would be a terrible mistake saying it’s about oil prices, arms deals & Iran. He claims 450 billion in Saudi deals but they’ve promised only 14.5 billion and he is ignoring CIA conclusion crown prince ordered Khashoggi murdered
2676 2018-11-20 20:48:34 Dear @realDonaldTrump:

You are despicable! The price of oil is more important than a human life? What is wrong with you? Have you no shame?  Apparently not...just a totally disgusting human being. 

Sincerely, 
A  Disgusted Citizen

2677 2018-11-20 20:48:32 try grape seed oil, au naturale
2678 2018-11-20 20:48:31 I think if everyone makes some changes and voices their opinions surly the bigger companies have to listen though? It’s almost impossible to wipe out palm oil products from a household. I know vegans that have palm oil products. Change has to start somewhere x
2679 2018-11-20 20:48:31 Plus when my red eyeshadow stains I just use coconut oil like it's not the end of the world smh
2680 2018-11-20 20:48:30 It's a complex situation. The long term competition is USA vs.  China, Russia and now Europe who wants an army. Does making enemies of Saudi Arabia helps us vs. our competition? Especially since Oil is sold at USD Petro Dollar by OPEC!
2681 2018-11-20 20:48:22 Only;
1. You haven't told me why you dispute the figures. Other than making claims you've never provided any evidence of
2. I didn't even given you the oil figures. Just the explanation of the maritime border
3. Get to your bed
2682 2018-11-20 20:48:09 Peppermint oil, pretty darn good.
2683 2018-11-20 20:48:06 When did tRump become the one to set oil prices?
2684 2018-11-20 20:48:06 The mkt won’t go up until oil prices go up. Whomever is giving you economic advice should be fired.
2685 2018-11-20 20:48:01 Thanks Martha Hall Findlay. It's so nice to hear an important Liberal voice, speak up. Nobody wins with the approach of the Liberal/NDP agenda to landlocked Alberta oil. This has become the most divisive issue in Canadian politics thanks to Trudeau
2686 2018-11-20 20:47:59 @realDonaldTrump ok dotard , if you’re not going to do anything to Saudi’s, then tell them to drop the price of a barrel of oil to half it’s price if you want America first
2687 2018-11-20 20:47:55 Dear Donny from Queens,

كل ما نحتاجه هو تناكر فاكيوم نظيفه لا يوجد بها oil بداخلها لكي يتم تصريف مياه الامطار بعد شفطها مباشرةً  الى البحر.

2690 2018-11-20 20:47:41 Lol.yeah.#ZEN Azerbaijan oil fields..not exaclty a safe haven
2691 2018-11-20 20:47:39 at what levels does an oil recession become a serious eventuality ? 2015 levels or has this changed?
2692 2018-11-20 20:47:33 Trump is taking credit for low oil prices because of his relationship with Saudi Arabia...hold on a sec...the sharp decline in oil prices occurred when the Fed abandoned its loose money program in 2014-2016. Stronger dollar negatively impacts oil prices. He is truly a moron.
2693 2018-11-20 20:47:32 Cooper, last: "It’s America’s farmers and biofuel producers who need help today–not Fortune 100 oil companies looking for a bailout from longstanding legal obligations."
2694 2018-11-20 20:47:32 Trump is in front of the press saying “America First” & that he is not abandoning Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake. He credits himself why oil prices are down. “Being president has cost me a fortune. SA has nothing to do with me! I could care less what SA does! OMG”
2695 2018-11-20 20:47:31 And people always say nothing goes straight up or straight down. Well, oil has pretty much gone straight down....
2696 2018-11-20 20:47:26 I didn’t lol.. can you put oil in your ears
2697 2018-11-20 20:47:23 According to Trump, another country can kill a US resident because it keeps the oil prices down.#saudiarabia
2698 2018-11-20 20:47:19 Let's cut to the chase then. The economic impact could very easily be the same as the oil embargo. Considering every indication we have seen, the Mueller probe is gonna make Watergate look like a walk in the park, especially considering that Nixon gave in rather that fight...
2699 2018-11-20 20:47:16 From the President’s mouth-low oil prices are more important than human rights.
2700 2018-11-20 20:47:14 dude you're wasting your time, he's attacked anyone with actual physical oil experience or "tweets too much" - he doesn't know your background - all he does is buy cheap otm options - anyone with an actual career background in big oil brings out his insecure fckin ass
2701 2018-11-20 20:47:13 Makes sense.   Democrat want president to fail with higher oil prices.  They are stupid!
2702 2018-11-20 20:47:06 I've had the coconut oil on my hair and I spring avi's today
2703 2018-11-20 20:47:06 OK, maybe not. Maybe the oil crisis made a big enough impression on him that he is acting on it. At least that's what he just said.
2704 2018-11-20 20:47:05 Hey @Walmart, my mom and have been stuck in this Walmart getting her oil changed for 2 hours. And they broke her dipstick...hopefully they don’t charge us..I’ll keep you update. – bij Walmart Supercenter
2705 2018-11-20 20:47:01 agreed the bushies were in bed with the saudis re: oil and propogandized WMDs in iraq such that by the time we went to war with iraq half the country believed sadaam caused 9/11
2706 2018-11-20 20:47:00 I'm assuming it's like petrol prices where price hikes are passed on almost in real time when oil goes up but where it takes some time to see the price fall when oil goes down 
2707 2018-11-20 20:47:00 So to clarify: An American President is going to do nothing about an American resident with three citizen children being murdered because of oil. Got it.
2708 2018-11-20 20:46:58 There is a glut of oil in the world today and future demand is on a path to zero. Not a good time to be Saudi.
2709 2018-11-20 20:46:58 Coconut oil
2710 2018-11-20 20:46:55 The amount of money oil producing African countries make yearly is enough to end extreme poverty in Africa, yet many Africans are poor.
2711 2018-11-20 20:46:52 Housing market, slowing.

Now we have holiday season upcoming, which will jack up the market for a bit, but the underlying disease remains. 16k is coming.

2713 2018-11-20 20:46:46 U.S. slaps sanctions on 9 targets related to Iran-Russia network which allegedly provides oil for Syria and funds Hamas and Hezbollah
2714 2018-11-20 20:46:44 Made some banishment oil. #witchytime
2715 2018-11-20 20:46:41 The price of oil would disappoint them more when we would have to pay 5.00 a gallon for gas!
2716 2018-11-20 20:46:40 Has oil prices gone down because of the United States and Saudi Arabia connections? Or, has oil prices gone up after the United States pulled out of the Iran Nuclear Deal? I think oil prices has gone up.
2717 2018-11-20 20:46:38 Crude lower for low longer until the USA wakes up to the environmental and health problems that Shale oil is will create - tick tock only a matter of time unfortunately
2718 2018-11-20 20:46:37 Trump claims HE has kept oil prices low.Such an ego.Trump lies about his ties to Saudi Arabia.He can't seem to help himself.His lies to the press are so obvious.His remarks are the only fake part of news.Defends his daughter's use of private email.He complains about 9th circuit
2719 2018-11-20 20:46:29 フォークOILはインド製で品質が悪いのでなるべく早く日本製に交換したほうが良いです。

2720 2018-11-20 20:46:28 More Cooper: "Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s blatant abuse of the small refinery waiver provisions set in motion the massive wealth transfer from rural America to multinational oil companies that we are continuing to witness today."
2721 2018-11-20 20:46:26 The squeaky gears get all the oil. So squeak. Raise hell!
2722 2018-11-20 20:46:25 @realDonaldTrump just mentioned something about SA raising the $ on oil if we back out of the weapons deal... So is he saying that SA is bribing him for their support in the #Kashoggi murder?
2723 2018-11-20 20:46:25 Dear auto industry, what's it going to take to make all cars not oil dependent.
We can't let @realDonaldTrump make us bitches to SA for oil.

2726 2018-11-20 20:46:08 shit all you gotta do is change the oil and oil filter on the jeep  i’ll even guide you through it, i just don’t wanna crawl underneath it today tbh
2727 2018-11-20 20:46:07 You do know that wind turbines need oil to run and coal to be made right?
2728 2018-11-20 20:46:06 #msnbc  Oh Donnie... we're going to find out how much the Saudi's and Russia are giving you.  He's xxxxxxx delusional.  Screw Oil Prices, boot MBS out.  wth ?
2729 2018-11-20 20:46:00 There's no reason methane and maybe even crude oil cannot be from both sources.  (coal is definitely from organic matter though.)
2730 2018-11-20 20:46:00 Are you supposed to tip at a drive thru oil change place??
2731 2018-11-20 20:45:55 We had a harmony I' never meant to spoil Now it's lying in the water like a slick of oil I turn around and head on back along the pay wall I felt something give and crack and now I'm sorry, that's all for now... #Beachcombing this is us @MarkKnopfler
2732 2018-11-20 20:45:55 RFA's Cooper: “When an oil company whose net profits surpass the total value of the Iowa corn crop claims it is experiencing ‘hardship,’ you know we’ve reached a new level of absurdity."
2733 2018-11-20 20:45:51 Then in a press junket, basically said "they (Saudis) have helped me keep oil prices down..." Therefore the price of oil is more important than the life of some journalist - especially a brown one that works for the Washington Post. That is #Trumpism in a nutshell.
2734 2018-11-20 20:45:49 Trump is talking so openly about keeping oil prices down as the major factor in dealing with Saudi human rights violations. Both Bushes specifically downplayed the importance of oil in their Middle East activities, rebutting charges from critics that that was the basis.
2735 2018-11-20 20:45:48 @realDonaldTrump

2741 2018-11-20 20:45:27 Trump just said on TV that oil prices are more important than holding Sauda Arabia accountable for murder of an American Journalist.
2742 2018-11-20 20:45:26 @tdichristopher looks like Mark Fisher was DEAD WRONG about the next move for oil maybe he should try the weather
2743 2018-11-20 20:45:22 .@POTUS #TRUMP just said he won’t risk oil prices going up just because the Saudis murdered an American resident. 
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
#ImpeachTrump. He just put a price on all our heads.
2744 2018-11-20 20:45:21 Gas prices have risen substantially since Trump took office. Now he claims oil prices lower because of him. Wow.
2745 2018-11-20 20:45:15 Just listened to Trump sell the American soul to keep oil prices down.  Today I’m ashamed to be an American. Trump does not speak for the majority of America, he speaks for the bigoted and the ignorant.
2746 2018-11-20 20:45:14 You guys are super great at creating "opportunities" in the "clean oil off birds" sector too.
2747 2018-11-20 20:45:14 That should also apply to Oil.
2748 2018-11-20 20:45:14 Equation: Murder < lower oil
prices. He doesnt even tiptoe around it. Trump isnt going to destroy economy over a silly little murder of a journalist who resided in America.
2749 2018-11-20 20:45:13 Today in GOP Kansas.....Trump explained today that Saudi Arabia could murder US Residents as long as they help Trump keep oil prices down and give us weapon orders.  Despicable.
2750 2018-11-20 20:45:13 @realDonaldTrump so oil prices are more important to you than human life- you are a lying piece of Trash!!!
2751 2018-11-20 20:45:11 @MSNBC oil prices are in great shape?

2754 2018-11-20 20:45:08 Because our politicians are owned by oil companies. They'd murder us all to keep that dirty oil money flowing. We're held hostage by a corrupt petrostate. #nlpoli
2755 2018-11-20 20:45:08 The alleged President says oil prices are more important than protecting people from assassination by foreign governments.  Out loud.
2756 2018-11-20 20:45:04 @realDonaldTrump only concern is the low oil prices; screw whoever has to die for it! Tjo America first people 
2757 2018-11-20 20:45:01 you get cheap oil if you suppoprt murder.
The world according to @realDonaldTrump
#LockUpIvanka 
The Trump Family are Crooks.
2758 2018-11-20 20:45:00 Trump just now: "Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me."

This on the day Trump is briefed on CIA's findings that Saudi Arabia's crown prince ordered the killing of a journalist.

He then pivots to low oil prices being far greater than morality.
2759 2018-11-20 20:44:59 @LAFDtalk In an Oil Spill do you use Micro Blaze, or what do you use to clean up a Spill?
2760 2018-11-20 20:44:54 Diced or sliced? 
Fried in olive or vegetable oil?
2761 2018-11-20 20:44:54 Trump to Press: If we broke with Saudi Arabia, oil prices would go through the roof.....Being President has cost me a fortune.  Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me.  Saudi Arabia will get military equipment from Russia and China [if we break with them].
2762 2018-11-20 20:44:53 The US has more nat gas in Pennsylvania and Ohio than they or we need. We can easily get it from them. They don't have the heavy oil there. We have it in W. Can. We need to export that oil off both coasts and take portion of the proceeds to build leadership renewables industry.
2763 2018-11-20 20:44:52 There were times where we had low oil prices, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, before the Saudis killed a journo. #MAGA #FoxNews #Hannity #CNN #TheLead #FoxAndFriends
2764 2018-11-20 20:44:51 Shorter Trump: Oil>Human life. #MSNBC
2765 2018-11-20 20:44:49 My Lord @realDonaldTrump just said Saudi oil is worth more than a human life.
2766 2018-11-20 20:44:43 Do you think America is stupid? Since when haven’t we bowed down and looked the other way at Saudi atrocities? Are we going to buy less oil? Start a war with a country we’ve armed the hilt?  Are we going to have Boeing & others close up their plants in Saudi? Please.
2767 2018-11-20 20:44:42 Oh so the Saudis are holding us hostage over oil prices and Khashoggi was just their first victim?
2768 2018-11-20 20:44:36 Summary: Saudi have oil and they buy "billions of billions" dollars of our things so whatever.
2769 2018-11-20 20:44:36 IVE BEEN DOIN THIS ADULT THING FOR FIVE YEARS AND I STILL LIKE AN UNDEFEATED GOD WHEN I GO TO GET MY OIL CHANGED
2770 2018-11-20 20:44:34 oil was very much the reason that bush, cheney and rumsfeld wanted us to go to war with Iraq rather than the people who actually perpetrated 9/11 (saudi arabia) so this is nothing new...but in this case oil is more of a cover for private business interests that trump has with SA
2771 2018-11-20 20:44:28 Trump: “I’m not going to tell a country....that has helped me keep oil prices down...I’m not going to destroy our economy by being foolish with Saudi Arabia.”
2772 2018-11-20 20:44:27 @realDonaldTrump Let Russia and China deal with the Saudi’s. America is better than that.  Gas is up a dollar a gallon since you took office. How is that keeping oil prices down? You’re a fucking liar #LiarInChief #TrumpIsInBedWithTheSaudis #CorruptAdministration #POSPOTUS
2773 2018-11-20 20:44:26 I just dropped 80 on a fucking oil change don’t ask me to scoop you unless you dropping 30$ on me simple

2778 2018-11-20 20:44:00 @realDonaldTrump 

There is no South White House.

You took a beating in the midterms.

Selling weapons to a corrupt and murderous government is not America First. It's your Pocketbook First.

You have nothing to do with the price of oil.

You're full of shit.
2779 2018-11-20 20:43:58 The ONLY reason he is being even more of an idiot is because Saudis have oil. DUH
2780 2018-11-20 20:43:55 Oil prices being down is not equivalent to the death of #JamalKhashoggi

You are a jackass @realDonaldTrump

2790 2018-11-20 20:43:26 Totally a crock full of BS. If it’s good, Trump did it, if it’s bad it’s either Obama or the Dems. Look at Trump’s Economic policies or lack there of and you will find the cause. Oil is in a glut stage - supply and demand. Tax reform didn’t help everyone.
2791 2018-11-20 20:43:25 “Sarah, does the president actually think he, personally, is controlling the price of oil?

“Really?”
2792 2018-11-20 20:43:24 Ken, I'm no big fan of Kenny and in perfect world your rational works. However, WE need an aggressive advocate, it increases mojo and some investment and if your gonna point out Kenny’s shortcomings have a good look at the Liberals’ hypocrisy and foreign oil imported into Canada.
2793 2018-11-20 20:43:22 #TRUMP just said the #Khashoggi murder “is a shame, but it is what it is”. 
@POTUS just said if we broke with Saudis, oil would go through the roof. So, he’s essentially saying Saudis & others can murder & dismember any one of us, so long as money exchanges hands. 
#ImpeachTrump
2794 2018-11-20 20:43:17 We have more oil than they do. It quit being about oil a long time ago. It's about selling weapons and money. In Trump's case it's money. He has business deals with the royal family.
2795 2018-11-20 20:43:14 no the relationship is with the money and oil of Saudi Arabia
2796 2018-11-20 20:43:14 That's why Turkish tanks were feet from isis and never engaged. they were neutral because Erdogan's beef with Kurds who isis was fighting. He was protecting his own borders from kurds and buying isis' oil at same time. It was being shipped into Turkey.

2798 2018-11-20 20:43:10 By the way, 10% of 24% is 2.4%.  So, Saudi Arabia constitutes 2.4% of our total oil usage.  Not really such a great hand, is it?
2799 2018-11-20 20:43:08 Holy shit, this monster said that its not worthy doing anything because oil prices would go through the roof and its America first.  @GOP @SenateGOP you are supporting a monster that is literally burning away the fundamentals of this country.  Enjoy your seat in hell.

2801 2018-11-20 20:43:06 More pee tapes but with oil? 
2802 2018-11-20 20:43:02 No one takes action against the Saudis. Their business is worth too much to risk upsetting them. We are the same here in Britain. We were once Great Britain, but the Great has been erased by greed and desire. Weapons & Oil all mean a free pass.
2803 2018-11-20 20:43:02 The Saudis are the biggest promoters and founders  of Sunni Wahhabism . You know the ideology that created Al Qaeda and ISIS and attacked America on 9/11? Fuck their oil . They need us way more than we need them .
2804 2018-11-20 20:42:59 The first step Venezuela took was to chase out or close down all outside the Country investments, especially in oil and gas.  NOW LOOK AT VENEZUELA TO SEE THE RESULT.

2812 2018-11-20 20:42:44 Never did I think I'd live to see the president cite low oil prices as justification for murder.

Oh, wait. Wars were built on that idea. Nvm.
2813 2018-11-20 20:42:44 So, @realDonaldTrump says... we think the prince was in on it, but we may never know, because, OIL! #SaudiArabia #LiarInChief
2814 2018-11-20 20:42:42 Looks as though your boss is happy to stand for it.  Remember, he's the one with all the financial ties to oil money.  How much did they pay it for an entire floor at their tower in NYC...56.5 million?
2815 2018-11-20 20:42:36 They’re a big fish in a small pond of countries bent on Israel’s destruction.  
Control global oil prices.  
Politics!  

Pick any 1 or all three; you’d be right.
2816 2018-11-20 20:42:35 Trump, who has continued to tout newfound U.S. energy independence as a result of his policies, offers this by way of explanation:

"If we broke with Saudi Arabia, I think your oil prices would go through the roof."
2817 2018-11-20 20:42:34 Fatass a la Orange is on TV saying low oil prices are worth any human rights violation.
2818 2018-11-20 20:42:33 Trump literally just gave oil as a reason why he's not punishing Saudi Arabia. I mean, I guess we should appreciate he's more honest about it than prior administrations. It's just hearing it so bluntly....yikes. Our government is trashhhhhhhhhhh.
2819 2018-11-20 20:42:31 Fujitsu demonstrated it recently - blades stack vertically in bath of oil developed by 3M. Can remove/add blades. Liquid designed to remove heat - fire resistant etc
2820 2018-11-20 20:42:24 So, yes, crude oil is used to make plastic, but so is natural gas...and we produce a LOT of that. In fact, that is a bigger driver of plastic production than crude oil, at least in the US.
2821 2018-11-20 20:42:22 Heard these people talking on the phone and they said their muffler is leaking oil
2822 2018-11-20 20:42:21 Once again, @realDonaldTrump visits Mar-a-Lago for Thanksgiving instead of the troops in Afghanistan. In addition, America First as the excuse for "pardoning" Saudi Arabia for the murder of Khashoggi. The money and oil is most important!
2823 2018-11-20 20:42:18 On today’s episode of I’m sick: sitting in the sun, overloading my body with vitamin c and diffusing lemon grass oil into the air. I should be fine in no time. Ok. I hope everyone is having a better day than me.
2824 2018-11-20 20:42:14 Now @realDonaldTrump is saying he is the reason that oil prices are so low and if he did something about the #KhashoggiMurder they would spike.  
2825 2018-11-20 20:42:14 If so ...and we own it ..why don't we just say no ...  my ball I'm no playing . Get your own oil am keeping mine

2836 2018-11-20 20:41:47 @BulkApothecary How many drops of your fragrance oil are needed for a 16oz candle? Your site says one .5oz bottle can scent a gallon of wax (so 8, 16oz candles), but doesn’t have a drop measurement.
2837 2018-11-20 20:41:46 Because it's not - it's open bribery, corruption and self dealing/protection from the Trump's and the Oil and Gas clan.

We are not going to give up billions of dollars of orders," claims oil prices will go up. He says: "I'm not saying that at all" when asked if he's ignoring human rights

2845 2018-11-20 20:41:33 Citing oil prices as a reason not to punish SA... does he not realize that we are oil sufficient as a country now
2846 2018-11-20 20:41:33 It’s not even about oil protection anymore. The US is the number 1 oil producer in the world. It’s about having someone near the Resistance Axis. It’s about combatting, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, to name a few.
2847 2018-11-20 20:41:26 Theory now circulating is that #Saudi will keep current #Oil   prod not to mess with #Trump in the #KashoggiMurder case.
2848 2018-11-20 20:41:25 James Foley, Steve Sotloff and Kayla Mueller were under Obama's watch. Both Dems and Rep have coddled SA because they are sitting on a lot of oil
2849 2018-11-20 20:41:25 I need a oil change ASAP  I play too much tf 
2850 2018-11-20 20:41:20 This should be the last straw with Saudi Arabia.  They were never punished for 9/11 either.  The madness must stop.  Human life should be more important than the exchange of oil, weapons, and blood money.

2853 2018-11-20 20:41:11 I'm not surprised. The US have increased their oil production to almost 11m B/day almost equalling OPEC. We might see the price of crude fall to $56pb before end of the year. 
Even with Iran sanctions being intensified, I don't see it raising as they're using black market to sell

2859 2018-11-20 20:40:59 I’ll say this about internal combustion engines — they might be destroying the climate and ultimately humanity on earth, but at least it allows us to buy billions and billions of dollars worth of oil from Saudi Arabia
2860 2018-11-20 20:40:57 Still can’t get over the fact a boy in my flat literally set fire to oil then put the pan under water and it resulted in an actual fat fire in our kitchen
2861 2018-11-20 20:40:49 I already saw how Erdogan was doing business with isis in the past. He financed them by buying their oil that isis shipped to him.
2862 2018-11-20 20:40:48 And Saudi Arabia isn't the oil industry.  We only import 24% of our oil (we make a lot of the stuff).  40% of our imports come from Canada.  2nd place is Saudi Arabia, at 9%, followed by Mexico at 7%, Venezuela at 7% and Iraq at 6%. Mexico has nearly as much power as SA, then.

2867 2018-11-20 20:40:37 That's easy. Three options: i) Increase output: Keep pumping or fracking. Double the US output.
ii) Increase suppliers: Lift sanctions from countries like Iran and Venezuela. Flood the market with oil.
iii) Kill off demands: Keep up the trade wars and kill off the world economy.

2874 2018-11-20 20:40:10 Meanwhile, a $4.5 billion bailout for Kinder Morgan's investors and an estimated $20 billion for new pipeline and facilities costs taxpayers more and will increase carbon emissions - as well as adding to the oil glut that's depressing prices below cost.
2875 2018-11-20 20:40:09 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost @SaraEisen @JackieDeAngelis US oil producers @US_OGA is killing itself with oversupply & then #Trump dumps on it with tweets against #OPEC & wimpy #Iran sanctions (a trader called them suggestions). #Trump not a friend of US oil. #oil #wti #brent
2876 2018-11-20 20:40:07 Lol yes ma. I’ll use my CV to dry the car they did not even ask me to wash and use my personal certificate to hold the padlock while inserting oil... that very gate is the key to unlock level 1

2878 2018-11-20 20:40:06 Family Nutrition: #Cheeze-It this November? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.

2880 2018-11-20 20:40:04 Kudos to our board member/membership coordinator @Sabutabenjeh for her coauthored study "Systemic Approach for Disruption Risk Assessment in Oil and Gas Supply Chains" being accepted for publication in the International Journal of Critical Infrastructure #procurement #SupplyChain
2881 2018-11-20 20:40:04 We don't need their oil anymore, the US is now the largest producer of oil again, right now, it's just us digging in, like in Vietnam. And the effect it is having on us as a country isn't much different than the 2 decade ops/warfare in VN either. 2/2
2882 2018-11-20 20:40:00 Hi @the_SRA, what do you think about bio plastics? Great, because they replace oil based plastics, or are you concerned that they could cause other issues with recycling or wider environmental problems?
2883 2018-11-20 20:39:51 Suck snake oil, @Varneyco
2884 2018-11-20 20:39:51 Colm contains palm oil? I had no idea.
2885 2018-11-20 20:39:47 Did he forget that we produce oil here?
2886 2018-11-20 20:39:37 #Trump says he's not going to sanction the Saudis over #Khashoggi, b/c #SaudiArabia helps the U.S. keep oil prices down.
He omitted to say that he admires Saudis or any other regime (Putin's) that kills & chop journalists into little pieces b/C the press is the enemy of humanity.
2887 2018-11-20 20:39:21 Need a state inspection, oil change, tire rotation or any other auto repair on Black Friday? We are open from 8-5. Call today or tomorrow and schedule your appointment! 3364311516
2888 2018-11-20 20:39:15 Yeah, the Saudi Royal family wants to kill Americans so bad that they give America favored oil prices and land for military bases. On the other hand, Iran is the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism.
2889 2018-11-20 20:39:10 That’ll teach those Saudi’s no new permits! But we’ll continue to trade oil with you while ignoring our own economic destruction of AB & Sask provinces
2890 2018-11-20 20:39:05 let me go re up on the CBD oil
2891 2018-11-20 20:39:04 he & his supporters killed every pipeline .. Energy East, Northern Gateway and TMX. BTW .. and his influence has been great in getting XL going hasn't it. Complete zero .. just like the US pays for Canadian oil .. zero!
2892 2018-11-20 20:39:00 Buhari’s regime invested in more terrorist in Nigeria to be able to loot Nigeria treasures (lands, oil) and to stay in power. His government uses military, police and mercenary to intimidate opposition and those against his chaotic agenda. Boko Haram was emboldened to kill.
2893 2018-11-20 20:38:59 Well let’s all forget about the prior admission that sold uranium to Russia, sided with the Palestinians, Pakistanis, and the Assad regime. Was against US oil exploration, the pipeline... list goes on. Apparently your memory is less than 24 months.
2894 2018-11-20 20:38:36 The drop in oil is definitely welcome ..Frackers have much lower breakevens thanks to the purging in early 2016 ..Retailers talking about a healthy consumer and lower gas helps that..stocks getting whipped around by algos and indices ..BTFD still plays
2895 2018-11-20 20:38:35 A fake poisoning of former nobody in London and all hell breaks loose on Russia. An opposition journalist killed by Saudi- nothing!!! Military contracts and oil changes US consciousness.  Hippocrates!!!
2896 2018-11-20 20:38:30 The dumbazz knew he was playing with fire. Time to stop pumping oil or selling to select nations
2897 2018-11-20 20:38:27 After sous vide, finish the duck in a cast iron pan on  high heat with some olive oil.
Sear the duck for like 1m on each side.

Take the duck out to rest.

Lower heat, add aromatics (onion, garlic, rosemary)

Use wine to deglaze the pan. Let reduce by half. Add butter and simmer
2898 2018-11-20 20:38:26 accidentally got sizzling hot cooking oil on my foot.. now I’m dying a slow, painful death 
2899 2018-11-20 20:38:22 As usual, oil production rears its ugly head.
Does trump NOT know that some of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia?
2900 2018-11-20 20:38:21 Or “oil is expensive and life is cheap.”
2901 2018-11-20 20:38:17 *Cries in Irish* (tears are olive oil)
2902 2018-11-20 20:37:57 It really is.  A little bit peppery.  Smooth.  Already starts in nicely-sized pieces. 

I put handfuls of it on top of pizza with a little oil and salt and pepper to health up what would otherwise be junk food.
2903 2018-11-20 20:37:53 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
2904 2018-11-20 20:37:46 BREAKING: Donald Trump Says "Saudi Arabia Can Take the Lives of Our Journalists, But They Can't Take Away Our Oil"
2905 2018-11-20 20:37:45 Stop the money, oh, I mean the oil from flowing.
2906 2018-11-20 20:37:41 The US still defends Human Rights but it's a selective thing, it has always been. They are making billions from selling arms to Saudi and they are also buying their oil. If it was just any other country like Nigeria, they will rain sanctions and threaten to invade
2907 2018-11-20 20:37:40 Donnez moi du gaz oil je vous en supplie
2908 2018-11-20 20:37:33 Same here. Right back to Jan level. Libs ruin everything they touch.
2909 2018-11-20 20:37:33 The murder was recorded from a phone! Just proof that Trump has become another puppet! Big Oil doesn’t want to miss out! We the people have to get rid of the puppeteers; The Federal reserve, big pharma, and Big Oil!
2910 2018-11-20 20:37:26 “They have huge...tracts of oil!”
2911 2018-11-20 20:37:24 Shortly after french Societe General Bank getting fined for $1.3 bln over breaching IR #Iran sanx, Iran Deputy Oil Minister Zamaninia says "Maybe France will host SPV."
Sounds weird
2912 2018-11-20 20:37:18 Neither do but I always put chapstick on under and take it off with baby oil
2913 2018-11-20 20:37:07 I feel like I always need an oil change
2914 2018-11-20 20:36:57 Does Iran sell us oil and buy our weapons? The answer to this question is found only at the bottom line.
2915 2018-11-20 20:36:57 And he gotta change my oil after that
2916 2018-11-20 20:36:55 @realDonaldTrump PRIVATE,
Dear Mr. President,
Kindly, Billions of dollars of oil revenue in exchange of regime change in Iran.
It is all for mutual interest and peace for Iranian and the world.
God bless you
2917 2018-11-20 20:36:54 "EPA's rampant granting of RFS exemptions to small refineries, some of which are part of large oil refining companies, has continued to impact ethanol demand despite recent statements to the contrary by the oil
industry," said @richmanews. Could apply to Chevron too.
2918 2018-11-20 20:36:54 * Controlling Oil Prices. And it’s good business. He is anti Semitic like the Prince.  Dont get upset. On asking a rabbi about the Holocaust he laughed and said that’s good business. Hey are all in it together for money  sake. Period. The Prince,bestie, Jew DonaldJTrumpJr
2919 2018-11-20 20:36:51 Hey Trump @realDonaldTrump What did that psycho MBS offer you? Election help? Oil? A hotel? 
The American people know you. With that, we know you are for sale!
2920 2018-11-20 20:36:50 The reason that oil is down so much in past month is a slowing global economy and the fact that the cancelling of Iran Deal did not result in Iranian oil being cut off from world markets as was feared.
2921 2018-11-20 20:36:43 What’s the point of cbd oil
2922 2018-11-20 20:36:38 I know what you mean. My comparison to motor oil are my words. I use them because diesel vehicles can use these oils as fuel which im sure youve heard of people offering to take the used oil from restaurants for free or offering to buy it instead of it going to the recycler guys.
2923 2018-11-20 20:36:33 $WTI CRUDE OIL 
$53.30 -3.90 -6.82%
2924 2018-11-20 20:36:31 Time to stop pumping oil
2925 2018-11-20 20:36:27 it adds to the effect it looks musty and dirty and like its covered in oil and bodily fluids
2926 2018-11-20 20:36:17 My car is my fucking child. She’s just as expensive and stay wanting something ...whether it be gas, oil change, new tires etc ...
2927 2018-11-20 20:36:15 AKA This country is totally getting bribed by Saudi oil. As long as they give us oil, US will keep selling them weapons and aid in their war crimes and murders.
2928 2018-11-20 20:36:06 Todays moves have been dictated by further Italian budget concerns and a commodities rout that has seen AUD, NZD and CAD dip lower as Oil crumbled 7%. The spread between Italian and German bonds widened yesterday as concerns over the Italian budget weighed on the market.
2929 2018-11-20 20:36:03 But that doesn’t mean they can’t oil prices. OPEC.
2930 2018-11-20 20:36:02 Dropped car off at @Walmart to have oil changed bc it's close to work.  4 hours later I have to call them to ask if it's ready and they say the order was cancelled bc they didn't have the tool to replace the oil filter.  This is why I avoid Walmart!

2932 2018-11-20 20:35:57 Bio oil worked great for me!
2933 2018-11-20 20:35:55 Oil
2934 2018-11-20 20:35:52 you ever just keep eating something, trying to decide whether or not you like it? thats me with these peanut oil fried sweet potato chips. I'm on the fence rn... :l
2935 2018-11-20 20:35:51 oil!
2936 2018-11-20 20:35:42 Body oil or car oil 
2937 2018-11-20 20:35:40 @StockTwits MPLX check a 3 year chart.. even when oil was near 40...
The dip below 32 has been a 1 day low then reversal. On target for the same and the rally into January. A possible Trump/China rally near term and Oil can also rally off this low. Why sell a 7.5% div. and growth
2938 2018-11-20 20:35:39 build Energy East. Charge tolling tax for oil flowing east through it. Use the tolling tax to build leadership renewables industry. A carbon tax just drives investment south so US can continue to get our oil for free and invest in renewables so we have to buy forever. DUMB.
2939 2018-11-20 20:35:37 E45 and tea tree oil are like gold for ur face
2940 2018-11-20 20:35:30 Todays moves have been dictated by further Italian budget concerns and a commodities rout that has seen AUD, NZD and CAD dip lower as Oil crumbled 7%. The spread between Italian and German bonds widened yesterday as concerns over the Italian budget weighed on the market.
2941 2018-11-20 20:35:29 Nah. Arms bogus cover story using "American jobs" bait. About oil and real estate which doesn't really create American jobs. Read it again $450 billion-lie 100's thousands jobs-lie. Notice oil and 'helped ME' with prices. Close attention and truth decipherable from the old crook
2942 2018-11-20 20:35:26 Irving will keep importing Saoudi's oil. They said so when Saoudi Arabia applied pressure on Canada (on the behalf of tRUmp) during the NAFTA negociations. When Mrs Freeland criticize them for their human rights policies(or lack of)
2943 2018-11-20 20:35:24 Considering how fat the modern humans are it must be better to use ded people instead to make oil from 
2944 2018-11-20 20:35:24 WHAT’S IN SAUDI ARABIA?! OIL. TRUMP CHOOSES BUSINESS OVER MORALITY PEOPLE @ TRUMP SUPPORTERS WAKE TF UP
2945 2018-11-20 20:35:19 Going to try and set myself a challenge to not dry/straighten my hair until the New Years. Just plait it and get some argon oil to tame. Hoping it does wonders for my hair 
2946 2018-11-20 20:35:15 Oil rules!
2947 2018-11-20 20:35:08 dude he probably has to since they own the worlds oil.
2948 2018-11-20 20:35:08 Has little to do with the government. It is more so a supply / demand issue. Nations that used to import Canadian oil have become independent, and thus, we have a glut of the stuff with no buyers. 

We are all going to suffer as a result of this.
2949 2018-11-20 20:35:08 Crude oil futures for January plunge further Tuesday afternoon. $WTI_Crude -6.91% at $53.25, $NBZ_F -6.69% at $62.32, $USO -7.02% at $11.29 for 11/20/18.
2950 2018-11-20 20:35:07 Never cook with butter. What oil is healthiest? Extra virgin olive oil! It contains monounsaturated fat and helps keep cholesterol down!
2951 2018-11-20 20:35:07 I wouldn't count on that. There are more than enough  big spenders of both parties left to pass a huge infrastructure bill. It's coming
2952 2018-11-20 20:35:06 Put some Alewia Hair Care oil on your dry ass weave pls sis 
2953 2018-11-20 20:34:59 I view every tweet as if @StephenAtHome were reading it. When talking about keeping oil prices low-"so important for the world." I choked on my covfefe.
2954 2018-11-20 20:34:58 tea treat oil is good if you just use it as a spot treatment kinda thing! You could try something w retinol as well they have lots of amazing skin care things at tjmaxx
2955 2018-11-20 20:34:58 Lower oil prices. Lower fed rates. Lower dollar. The elusive trinity.
2956 2018-11-20 20:34:54 “Native” meaning you want to see my birth certificate? St. Joseph’s Hospital (that’s in DENVER - ass) 1974
“Big oil”? Nope. Most of the energy providers in my state are small independents.
2957 2018-11-20 20:34:54 Today Trump chose oil over humanity
2958 2018-11-20 20:34:54 That Trump "Standing by Saudi Arabia" statement tonight in full...

1) Give us your oil.
2) Buy our weapons.
3) Help us kick Iran.
4) And, anyway, that Jamal Kashoggi looked a bit dusky and shifty, didn't he?
5) Er... that's it.
2959 2018-11-20 20:34:52 Iranians don't want leverage over the USA. We want to be left alone & treated as a sovereign country with the same dignity afforded to everyone else. We shouldn't have to worry about foreign spies trying to destroy our country for oil profits.
2960 2018-11-20 20:34:50 Slippery slope to further govt interference; this must remain a market choice. Oil comps losing cash as well but continue to pump as they have fixed costs no matter what volume that's pumped.

What's next; ranchers if beef prices collapse; dentists if kids no longer get cavities?
2961 2018-11-20 20:34:49 No.  Since the guy with the oil controls a resource your country #literally can't function without, he has all the power and #heknowsit.  

Shopping would go on without Bezos.  Your phone/tablet/computer wouldn't exist without crude oil.
2962 2018-11-20 20:34:42 Well that’s not supremacist at all. I’m saying if all the pieces weren’t in place then the game would’ve been lost. Hence we had the Allied commander that was the leader of the Allied forces. 5 star General Eisenhower.  Patton in Africa. Shut down the oil lines. Then to Sicily.
2963 2018-11-20 20:34:39 More like "herd insanity." Following the "wisdom" of snake oil salesman "Dr." Andrew Wakefield, the quack who was paid to say that vaccines cause autism. He is no longer a doctor, and hundreds of studies have proven him 100% WRONG.
2964 2018-11-20 20:34:36 Dropped hella racks #topicals I have every right to carry around 7 grams of Rick simpSON oil. Pushing oil like Osama
2965 2018-11-20 20:34:34 this is incredible, did you use oil or acrylic?
2966 2018-11-20 20:34:27 I remember lu saying that the soap in the bathrooms was made outta baby oil and we would rub our hands together and chant baby oil
2967 2018-11-20 20:34:22 LUV when i can feel the mask sucking out all my dirt, oil and sins.
2968 2018-11-20 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
2969 2018-11-20 20:34:19 America should never have been in WWII

Things they didn’t teach you in government schools:

-Wall Street funded Hitler (specifically Prescott Bush, George W Bush’s grandpa)
-US was trying to get Japan to attack, we cut off 90% of their oil supply; they basically had to attack.
2970 2018-11-20 20:34:18 Thank god some random numbnuts on Twitter has assured me that calibres of research and projection based on hard science and evidence means fuck-all. Now I can go back to sucking oil out of sand to jerk off CEOs.
2971 2018-11-20 20:34:13 That sounds like a nice mix of colours . I used Osmo Polyx oil on this, first time I’ve used it and I was really impressed.
2972 2018-11-20 20:34:02 Tough day on the market.  Brutal day for #Crypto.  But it was bad across the world, and even hit #OIL.  And now they are investigating the great Bitcoin run up of 2017 for manipulation.  What will they do?  Make people pay back all the profits they have now lost? #bitcoin
2973 2018-11-20 20:34:01 They’ve tried doing #oil #pipeline #foreignpolicy #containment in #CentralAsia / #MiddleEast as part of a #PlanB 

Unsuccessful containment in #SouthChinaSea with #China building #military installations on those islands
2974 2018-11-20 20:33:54 TRUMP SAYS HE'D LIKE OIL PRICES TO BE LOWER

TRUMP SAYS WOULD LIKE TO SEE FED RATES LOWER
2975 2018-11-20 20:33:54 Good now stop buying their oil too.
2976 2018-11-20 20:33:51 @Babybarracudess thanks again for the recommendation on the tip on the Olbas oil. I got my bottle today and immediately put some on my temples. Keep turning my head so I can smell it LOL. It definitely helps ease the sinus headache
2977 2018-11-20 20:33:48 Mais a queda do Oil, petro sofre... Fueda.
2978 2018-11-20 20:33:47 Oil?
2979 2018-11-20 20:33:45 Sorry, but it's not just about having a "clear, relatable message." We have one unfortunately, and it's "oil, guns, and no taxes are the future of Colorado." The last time that message resonated was before I was born. Our growth sectors are tech/services. Oh, and we're not Texas.
2980 2018-11-20 20:33:44 Do you really believe in those arguments? Or you have a sibling working at CBD Oil industry?
2981 2018-11-20 20:33:43 I’ve switched to arugula. Little olive oil and feta cheese. #silly
2982 2018-11-20 20:33:28 Oil 
2983 2018-11-20 20:33:27 SO someone was all "if vegetable oil is made of vegetables then whATS BABY OIL MADE OF" and it became this long thing we would say in funny voices n at one point I think we accused you of actually being baby oil bc u were a baby
2984 2018-11-20 20:33:25 Wise choice   lets hope we stop buying their oil too
2985 2018-11-20 20:33:22 And it will run to at least 250K if you just change the oil and transmission fluid when you’re supposed to 
2986 2018-11-20 20:33:12 Pumpkin Spice fat bomb:

4oz softened cream cheese

1/4 tsp ground ginger
2-3 tbls coconut oil or butter

Blend. Freeze until firm.

2987 2018-11-20 20:33:10 You don’t care Judith. You do t care about climate at all. You want oil and gas exploration to continue. Stop pretending you care.
2988 2018-11-20 20:33:10 Wild growth oil and the Cantu ACV line that’ll literally all. Then ego styler for styling
2989 2018-11-20 20:33:06 unless your oil is rancid.
2990 2018-11-20 20:33:04 @ericnuttall it's called #oil QE #OILQE  Trumps last kick at boosting voters prosperity
2991 2018-11-20 20:33:00 came to get an oil change.. "on the jeep liberty, right?" me: *internally crying* no i got a new car 
2992 2018-11-20 20:32:57 Attn shoppers: Black Friday is here!  Large discounts in Crude Oil, Crypto, Tech. Smaller discounts in broader stock market and credit.
2993 2018-11-20 20:32:56 On the other hand the  'Statement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia' = "You can kill who you like MBS and Saudi Arabia as long as we collectively control the price of oil" - We don't care about the other 'stuff' #FakePresident #MoronsAreGoverningAmeria
2994 2018-11-20 20:32:53 Pull to see if President Donald say i hope you don't get i bet you don't get your Businesses like one of my Rockefeller houses or Rockefeller park tower apartment or my gas and my oil or just any Rockefeller anything okay thanks
2995 2018-11-20 20:32:53 I think our MPs should go and live in Saudi Arabia Oil wells!
2996 2018-11-20 20:32:42 I’m not getting it. I’m Canadian, am I supposed to be upset by Trump. Trudeau should take the moral high ground here and break off all ties with Saudi Arabia. Cancel all business, stop all oil imports then punish any Canadian business who persists business with them.
2997 2018-11-20 20:32:41 Look at the price of Western Canada Select oil, at $17-something a barrel.  
They can’t be having a good time these days...
2998 2018-11-20 20:32:40 CIA already nailed him for #Trumprussia; Big Boss Vladimir has already put him off them. As he insults American citizens who suffer from forest fires or hurricanes (while still trying to promote coal!), or sells out everything for oil money, we must recognize is all of a piece.
2999 2018-11-20 20:32:36 The fact a foreign national was murdered in another country is horrible.  Should we cut off an ally and let Iran get stronger? Pull our soldiers, boycott their oil, let Russia and China gain influence? Obamaalresdy gave Iran 1.5B cash...  maybe behind the scenes pressure better
3000 2018-11-20 20:32:33 Oil oil oillll!!!!
3001 2018-11-20 20:32:25 well i need new & better oil paint anyway,,,

3003 2018-11-20 20:32:23 Trump wont stop til oil is $0
3004 2018-11-20 20:32:18 Welp nobody is answering my phone calls so I guess I’ll just go get my oil changed
3005 2018-11-20 20:32:16 I got my cars oil changed today after 9k miles. Miracles happen y’all 
3006 2018-11-20 20:32:16 I doubt it! SNP haven’t got a Scooby! All talk, me, myself & I ( Oil, Gas, Water)A lot of baby boomers retiring, who can guarantee their hard earned pensions, against austerity and higher taxes that would have to be implemented to just survive with Independence!
3007 2018-11-20 20:32:14 Is the Keystone Pipeline being built, because it should be which will help us to be oil independent instead of buying from haters of the USA
3008 2018-11-20 20:32:02 Coal and other mineral extraction processes get bashed by Clean power, but reality check oil and minerals are used to produce plastics and critical inputs that make modern life possible. #coal #mining #futureofmining
3009 2018-11-20 20:31:59 Oil lower
Rate lower
Stock lower
3010 2018-11-20 20:31:58 THE LORE! TELL ME THE BABY OIL LORE
3011 2018-11-20 20:31:53 i regret not buying these flat thin canvases i wanted to try oil painting again 
3012 2018-11-20 20:31:52 Saudi Arabia not an Allied of United States, Sponsor of Terrorism and violations for Human Rights We dont need their Oil, we have Plenty Here ,Also  @IvankaTrump should resign from her position and leave White House, Hillary was Wrong So is @IvankaTrump #SaudiArabia #IvankaTrump
3013 2018-11-20 20:31:49 Difference is that nobody in the USA would be shedding tears for an Iranian spy captured in the USA.

The same CIA that in the past literally overthrew Iran's government for oil profits in 1953. We can't equate victims of Empire with Empire itself.
3014 2018-11-20 20:31:45 And how does your green new deal protect jobs? I've worked in the oil fields for many years. If you get your way, thousands of union workers will be out a job. What kind of progressive are you?
3015 2018-11-20 20:31:43 Then they won’t be eating cottonseed. You’re trying to Sabatoge the point: cottonseed oil is a food option for people with no food.
3016 2018-11-20 20:31:39 Actually any right thinking business man will not support that atiku nigga, that nigga killed alot of coys in maritime and oil servicing for His own Coy to thrive. Atiku cant compete in a free and fair market. he needs govt for his business to thrive.
3017 2018-11-20 20:31:39 Amid the market sell-off, not much is being said about the fact that 2s/10s is back to around 25 bps ... that's uncomfortably flat when you're looking at bit slow downs in cars, housing and massive correction in oil ....
3018 2018-11-20 20:31:37 Yes, nothing new about being owned by the Saudis, big oil and the military industrial complex. Trump’s just extremely terrible at hiding it.
3019 2018-11-20 20:31:32 Woahhhhh guess who just got their oil changed. This bitch is getting her life togetherrrrrr
3020 2018-11-20 20:31:31 Because that's where they get their oil...
3021 2018-11-20 20:31:31 Can you explain the oil price drop?
3022 2018-11-20 20:31:30 International and local football is like oil and water Mangethe. Every weakness is exploited by international players unlike in the PSL
3023 2018-11-20 20:31:28 Not sure if the guy next to me in my oil painting class is muttering loudly to himself all through class, or he's on a phone call with his friends all through class. Either way if he doesn't cut it out I'm gonna break a canvas board over his head.
3024 2018-11-20 20:31:27 Money answreth all
3025 2018-11-20 20:31:26 USA will survive until oil remains. When the oil is gone USA is gone as well so USA will come down the only thing they do best. War.
3026 2018-11-20 20:31:26 I had the same problem and started using coconut oil.  My scalp hasn't been the same ever since.
3027 2018-11-20 20:31:22 He’s off golfing with OIL and BLOOD on his hands!! I’m disgusted by this money hungry slug! 
3028 2018-11-20 20:31:20 You, too!  And look into CBD oil, maybe?  I dunno.  Just don't want you to be in pain.
3029 2018-11-20 20:31:19 All you fools...we are the worlds number one producer of oil! Having Saudi Arabia as an ally is key in holding Iran at bay and protecting Israel...among some valuable points of interest! Why let Russia & China sell defense tools to them and become friendly? That’s ridiculous!
3030 2018-11-20 20:31:19 It would seem counter productive to advance #resistance efforts on every issue put forth, except China trade. You cant win on this one issue when everything else they do works in direct opposition
3031 2018-11-20 20:31:18 You’ve run out of olive oil in Islington perhaps? They’re searching for some
3032 2018-11-20 20:30:58 Just heard JRM referred to as a Snake Oil salesman lol
3033 2018-11-20 20:30:53 Oh. I bought a facial wash from Havendale Healthcare Centre and it's really good. It's a deep cleanser and it helps with oil control and acne.
3034 2018-11-20 20:30:52 Just make sure they are pure! Unfortunately lots of store bought ones are diluted and have added preservatives and stuff even though they say 100% of the oil!
3035 2018-11-20 20:30:49 Congratulations and great point about the Oil and Pharmaceutical companies.
3036 2018-11-20 20:30:48 I’ve heard jouer is better than shape tape. Pat some facial oil all over your face before putting on your Cosmetics. It really helps to look flawless.
3037 2018-11-20 20:30:47 Frying with light or refined olive oil is sometimes preferred. It has a high smoke point (~475F) and is neutral. Canola actually has lower smoke point (400F) than extra virgin (410F), using either one is OK but you will destroy the fruity flavors of the olive oil and it's more $.
3038 2018-11-20 20:30:44 That statement of support is all about money/oil. We all know that.
3039 2018-11-20 20:30:44 They have us over an (oil) barrel. Literally and figuratively.
3040 2018-11-20 20:30:38 Oil at $53 a barrel means oil companies may only make a $150 bil. a year instead of 300 billion! 
A blessing in gas prices to Americans! Yes
3041 2018-11-20 20:30:32 No of course not, but without anything to replace it, oil will simply be over supplied meaning lower prices.
3042 2018-11-20 20:30:29 I told my dad that I got my oil changed today and I think he was prouder than when I graduated from college

3046 2018-11-20 20:30:16 In 15 years, I think our field of corn will be GM maze, turned into the sort of syrup that fattens whole populations, topped up with palm oil that killed Orangutans, and cream from cows in sheds. The fat population will, as US citizens, worry every day about access to healthcare.
3047 2018-11-20 20:30:14 Coconut/Coconut Oil? This one is new to me. Many sites recommend it as healthy for dogs. Can you clarify?
3048 2018-11-20 20:30:11 First: We didn't see BHO refusing Saudi Oil Or closing U.S. Military bases there. To  Do So would have had disastrous results to our economy, which seems to be the democrat's goals. Second, the Clintons have taken 100's of millions in Saudi Donations to their Fouundation.
3049 2018-11-20 20:30:09 I use the ART face wash and the Miranda cleansing oil everyday and my face feels AMAZING 
3050 2018-11-20 20:30:06 BABY OIL also I think I remember the context
3051 2018-11-20 20:30:00 adding coconut oil to my green tea like a fucking champion
3052 2018-11-20 20:29:59 Jahil patwari Takes at least 3 months for oil bought today to be sold at pumps. Tell us about last 5 years of chor nasal.
3053 2018-11-20 20:29:57 Once we've used all your oil,  you can go.
3054 2018-11-20 20:29:56 Trump wants lower $OIL

Like WTF? 
3055 2018-11-20 20:29:54 The Saudi (Sunni) "amalgamation" is a counter weight to the opposing Iranian/Persian conundrum who both happen to be enemies of Israel. 

Not sure exactly where the angel moms fit in to this regional oil flashpoint for global disaster, but we're sure Trump loves the angel moms.
3056 2018-11-20 20:29:53 I know ppl in Alberta that don’t believe in climate change. They only want oil so they can get a big cheque
3057 2018-11-20 20:29:49 And who is going to invest in the big oil projects in 2019,2020 if oil is in the toilet. Replenishing used current drilled wells?
3058 2018-11-20 20:29:48 Yup 
3059 2018-11-20 20:29:48 Most Americans dont care about this. Wasting our time talking about it. Feel sorry for him, but not ready go to war. This is a pure beltway issue. Real Americans care about providing for their families. I like cheap oil!!!!
3060 2018-11-20 20:29:48 Do you think the oil move is mostly technical, or are you worried about global growth? Feels like oil is a big driver of waning market sentiment lately.
3061 2018-11-20 20:29:40 Really .. more than Olive Oil? Can’t believe that seriously. Brother lives in Italy. What he doesn’t know about #Oils & Rapeseed. Sorry but trust his knowledge. Thanks
3062 2018-11-20 20:29:38 Who wants to do my oil change? I’m lazy
3063 2018-11-20 20:29:36 "Norway's oil"? Since when did UK have Norway's oil? Surely you mean Scotland's oil when Scotland gains independence.
3064 2018-11-20 20:29:34 Con artiste get paid with Saudi oil monies to provide cover for murderer bin Salman
3065 2018-11-20 20:29:28 It replaces single use plastic with single use bioplastic though and regular plastic can be recycled over and over again. I know these will reduce oil being pumped out for production but what if same amount of oil is required to ship it or dispose of it?
3066 2018-11-20 20:29:27 U understand d message, that's all
3067 2018-11-20 20:29:26 The GITD Megavolt and oil splattered Wildcat would be cool, but the only Chase I HAVE to get is Monterey! But aside from Angela, have to at least have one of each. 
3068 2018-11-20 20:29:22 It now upsets me how many things has palm oil in. (Never knew what it caused before)
Sort of glad I spend half my life on prep but on cheat days I’ve been trying not to eat anything with it in but EVERYTHING I PICK UP HAS IT IN!!!!!!! Why why why why why!!!
3069 2018-11-20 20:29:11 Very low odds oil goes that high
3070 2018-11-20 20:29:09 Breaking News, three advisory board members go missing in Alberta Oil Patch.
3071 2018-11-20 20:29:09 My favorite video games this year

1) red dead redemption 2
2) Far Cry 5
3) supporting Saudi Arabian leadership isn’t a Trump problem, it’s an America problem. We’ve done it for decades of homophobia and patriarchy. Oil dependency is a disease.
4) spider-man
3072 2018-11-20 20:29:01 the turkeys like "I CALL BS i Saw what he did to that bucket of chicken, he said he was gonna love licking the oil off my deep fried skin ahahahahahahaah"
3073 2018-11-20 20:29:00 I have this memory about laughing with middle school friends about baby oil... I have no idea what the context is
3074 2018-11-20 20:28:55 @RepAdamSchiff is full of Schitt. We’ve already sanctioned 17 people. Adam, what would u like us to do? Enlighten me. U want us to cut off diplomatic ties with the worlds leading oil producer? What do u think that would do to the economy? Any guesses?
3075 2018-11-20 20:28:55 Oil change done 
3076 2018-11-20 20:28:48 Oil.   Oil.   Oil.  Oil.  More Oil.   We need your Oil.
3077 2018-11-20 20:28:45 lol he thought the department of energy controlled oil, so ever since then he's just been trying to hide in the back and hope he doesn't get called on by the teacher
3078 2018-11-20 20:28:45 Galit na si MVP...hhahaha...di nkapartnwr sa oil explo...mwhha
3079 2018-11-20 20:28:42 Metal, the oil, it almost made him gag. 

Judging by his expression, he clearly found it /very/ unpleasant, resisting the urge to plug his nose. 

This place... there was no life in this place. Only metal.
3080 2018-11-20 20:28:42 Rosehip seed oil and turmeric masks
3081 2018-11-20 20:28:40 I’m so obscenely mad at the situation with my car. Who knows what issues I’ll have in the future because there’s oil all over everything under the hood. It’s just ridiculous. How can you forget to put the cap back on? It was an oil change, not a list of 50 things to do.
3082 2018-11-20 20:28:36 Cam Consulting is a professional company that matches high quality manufacturers & service providers with customers to generate profit within the ag, oil, & constructions industries.  I am seeking new products, goods, and services to represent.

3083 2018-11-20 20:28:33 Oil absolutely melting here... great for Turkey & India. Very bad for MBS’s Vision, no pun intended
3084 2018-11-20 20:28:31 Jesus spelled backwards is Susej! Like Sausage! COINCIDENCE?  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3085 2018-11-20 20:28:29 The influence of oil and money is amazing!!!
3086 2018-11-20 20:28:21 Now that I know snickerdoodle crust pie will work, my lineup for thxgiving contribution:

2lbs buffalo chicken sloppy joe
fancy cheddar cheese for sandwiches
snickerdoodle crust chocolate pie
3087 2018-11-20 20:28:16 Dysfunctional system, period. Don't forget, NRA, Oil, banks, so many hugely profitable corporations subsidized by our tax money, via congress. Draining us dry. Destroying middle class. Americans drinking poison water. Kids not shot graduate college in debt. Rich get richer.
3088 2018-11-20 20:28:04 Laying the groundwork for war with Iran.
Big business deal: self dealing with JK involved.
KSA has American weapons systems needing American parts.
Shady manipulation of oil price?
Demonizing Adnan Kashoggi but trying not to look like it. Whar else?
3089 2018-11-20 20:28:01 I'm thinking of making some oil, myself.
3090 2018-11-20 20:28:00 I’m tired of hearing we r this great country and free when we have Oil,gun,insurance,banks & pharmaceutical companies running the government Because they need there money to win elections. Americans should have free HC and no family should go to bed hungry.
3091 2018-11-20 20:27:55 Cleaner air, less carbon into atmosphere and less imported oil are all + of EV : carbon tax in California currently about $185/mt so that is worth according to state calculations $24/brl!  Notwithstanding long term health benefits.
3092 2018-11-20 20:27:52 I got oil on my button up 
3093 2018-11-20 20:27:48 So many advances and we still burn oil, why? Tesla had the answer
3094 2018-11-20 20:27:44 Why were the boundaries of Englands and Scotlands oil fields moved in 1999? thus distorting GDP figures?
3095 2018-11-20 20:27:43 That’s not at all how that works. Glad to know a “credited” business news source doesn’t even understand OPEC or the way prices of barrels of oil work in correlation with supply and demand.
3096 2018-11-20 20:27:39 The Crown Prince and Trump son ate BESTIES. TRUMP The Prince and one one are now co telling the price of oil.  Money talks. Death walks   They do not care.  Stop begging him to care.
3097 2018-11-20 20:27:30 So we have to literally let them get away with murder because we don't have enough domestic oil production?
3098 2018-11-20 20:27:29 Libya was a wealthy thriving country before evil EU AND U.S showed up destroyed. look now an oil rich country turned into ruins. And it is hard recovery.
3099 2018-11-20 20:27:29 NOW: Bloody nose for the oil market as #Brent falls c.7% today at $62.37pb
3100 2018-11-20 20:27:28 @realDonaldTrump is creating huge volatility in all markets which by definition, hampers growth due to increased investment risk.  With an oil supply cliff in the medium term...is his comments negligent? Or does he not care beyond #2020? #OOTT
3101 2018-11-20 20:27:25 Sunday school? You mean Terror Camp! Where they indoctrinate children with anti-Western hate songs like “Give me oil in my lamp, keep it burning”!

It’s no coincidence that so many Sunday school-trained operatives blow themselves up on buses.
3102 2018-11-20 20:27:20 Oil...does it ever need to be any higher than $53 a barrel? NO!
The Dow dropped more than 600 points, as oil tumbled 7% to $53 per barrel.
3103 2018-11-20 20:27:18 It's been a while, but President Trump has restated his desire for Fed rates to be lower. He also said he'd like lower oil prices. I guess a 30% drop is not sufficient
3104 2018-11-20 20:27:17 I bet he doesn't even know what oil prices are at. They could be at $1 and he would still say "lower". He thinks he's negotiating with one of his building contractors.
3105 2018-11-20 20:27:15 About time we used the phrase “big oil” to mean the OPEC countries instead of US and European oil companies which are our only hedge against the OPEC tyranny. 

Completely agree that the US and UK support of Saudi is a disgrace...

3109 2018-11-20 20:27:05 I need some coconut oil for my hair 
3110 2018-11-20 20:27:03 The beacon is running out of oil...which in time can be replenished. So the hopeful side of my brain says!
3111 2018-11-20 20:26:59 I'd love to see this advert on the TV to inform us about the consequences of illegal and irresponsible destruction of resources and rainforest in the East to gain tons of cheap palm oil for cosmetics, confectionary, shampoo & sliced bread in the West. I support Greenpeace.
3112 2018-11-20 20:26:58 That website attributes donations from individuals who work for those industries as part of the industry. Texas oil and gas is the largest employer in the state. So the facts here are a little dubious without explanation.
3113 2018-11-20 20:26:55 For anybody dealing with chronic anxiety especially around the holidays, check out CBD oil.
3114 2018-11-20 20:26:47 Price changes for Thursday. SIX DAYS DATA TO BE UPDATED AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING: Heating/stove oil to drop by 2.4 cents a litre. Diesel to drop by 2.5 cents a litre. Gasoline down by 2.2 cents a litre. Markets fear any OPEC cuts will not be enough to support prices!
3115 2018-11-20 20:26:47 CBD oil can be used for pain relief, it’s not everyday get high Tobi 
3116 2018-11-20 20:26:41 i dont know what im doing in an oil shop please dont ask me questions just give my car the milk it needs and leave me out of it
3117 2018-11-20 20:26:31 How It could play out in 2019
1-Tech/weed/shitpto/oil sell off (in progress)
2-massive Oil inventory draws
3-oil and resources rich EMs skyrocket
4-Usd suffers
5-value wins vs growth at any price
3118 2018-11-20 20:26:27 A street thug grapples with coming-of-age after witnessing a fatal accident in North Dakota oil boom country.
3119 2018-11-20 20:26:23 The low price would hurt shale and other oil projects.  If the low price is here to stay, the oil led recovery in the oil regions would vanish.  So does people "healthy" paychecks.
3120 2018-11-20 20:26:19 "I'm sorry they killed your dad, but oil is cheap!"
3121 2018-11-20 20:26:11 Please someone interview Poloz today and ask him:
1- IS  OIL still  ''Clearly that is subtracting something from growth" ?
2- Still believe that our economy is ''overheating and creating inflation''?
3- How is the global economy recovery going?
3122 2018-11-20 20:25:56 完全よそ見しながら引いたらバチった音が聞こえて慌てて確認したらこれだよ_(┐「ε:)_
3123 2018-11-20 20:25:51 I am sure this Trump foreign policy, like so many of his foreign policies, is all about oil and money.
3124 2018-11-20 20:25:48 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
3125 2018-11-20 20:25:46 This makes me sick. We have white washed Saudi Arabia for years b/c of money. It’s shocking how few Americans understand out of 19 terrorists on 911 planes 15 were Saudi. Bin Laden from prominent Saudi Family! If we could stop oil dependency we could find our moral compass again!
3126 2018-11-20 20:25:42 So there it is.  Trump says he's not going to sanction the Saudis over Khashoggi, because Saudi Arabia has helped the U.S. keep oil prices down. Three of Khashoggi's children are American citizens. Their president couldn't care less.  Law and order president. Tough on crime.

3130 2018-11-20 20:25:23 Orange dude wants low oil prices, low rates 

So weaker dollar and higher stocks. Got it.
3131 2018-11-20 20:25:18 My grandpa uses oil to help with his COPD and puts it in rice krispie treats. No high, just relief. He gave me one for some back pain once. Shit tastes like an eraser.
3132 2018-11-20 20:25:03 Oil is a great bargaining chip hey
3133 2018-11-20 20:25:03 It reveals Trump values money more than life.
It reveals he has a low ability to construct meaningful prose.
It reveals he's determined to remain bound to oil far into the future, because he's too stupid to understand it'll run out.
3134 2018-11-20 20:24:45 Please don’t drink peanut oil
3135 2018-11-20 20:24:45 From the article:
"Since many of those refineries buy their oil once it’s already in Enbridge’s pipeline system, and therefore don’t have a history of shipping on the line, they were allocated zero space under the new rules."

3137 2018-11-20 20:24:35 Im curious what u people would like Trump to do? He’s sanctioned 17 people. You want him to cut off diplomatic relations with the worlds biggest oil producer? Do u people understand what would happen to the economy if we did that?
3138 2018-11-20 20:24:30 Mayonnaise is relatively simple. Egg yolks, beaten with mustard and seasoning, with a slow intro of vegetable oil until the sauce emulsifies & thickens. Add a little white wine vinegar which whitens the sauce, and even a little egg white to smooth it.  #mastercheftheprofessionals
3139 2018-11-20 20:24:28 And fuel efficient cars using less oil 
3140 2018-11-20 20:24:24 9% of our imported oil is from Saudi Arabia. Over 40% is from....Canada...a country Trump has declared a national security risk.  But which country deliberately tried to destroy the US oil industry? Saudi Arabia.  The same country that is a MAJOR funder of terrorism in ME.
3141 2018-11-20 20:24:08 I deep fried it in vegetable oil ,actually. Got carried away with the salt though ...

3143 2018-11-20 20:23:59 Imagine with all your oil how much Saudi Arabia could achieve by cooperating with Iran rather then always seeing it as a threat or an enemy . Get rid of the American military In the region everybody would be better off

3146 2018-11-20 20:23:56 We've been in the Middle East for decades and the place is worse now and we will always be there because of what is under ground, oil if there wasn't no oil there would be no US intervention
3147 2018-11-20 20:23:49 And an oil % for Rosneft
3148 2018-11-20 20:23:48 u can always replace some ingredients if u think it’s too much and also i used a non sticking fry pan so i didn’t use any butter or oil
3149 2018-11-20 20:23:44 People should have to review the uses of crude oil in the modern world before participating in this America First conversation.

No modern nation can function without crude oil.

That's why #AllYourPresidents put up with Saudi Arabia.

3150 2018-11-20 20:23:41 i wanna be honest antis gotta get rid of their acne before they can even consider coming for any of us.. looking crusty as hell... like get your face in order miss thang. buy some proactiv. some mario badescu drying lotion. tea tree oil.
3151 2018-11-20 20:23:37 So baking soda & cooking oil made into a paste really works well to remove label glue from bottles/tops.  I am reusing my glass spice jars to hold bulk spices and I'm very, very happy right now.

3157 2018-11-20 20:23:15 can the bond pit really not care about a 7% oil drop ? or are all of you on holidays already @Fullcarry
3158 2018-11-20 20:23:15 Look. I paid my bills, I have an oil change scheduled. Can I buy something fun now?
3159 2018-11-20 20:23:08 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
3160 2018-11-20 20:23:03 this is...not true. most cooks have an inexpensive olive oil and a more expensive one for finishing.
3161 2018-11-20 20:23:00 A stranger sold me snake oil with 100% poppycock and organic bunkum. I add a teaspoon to my applesauce and presto, I'm a success at balderdash.
3162 2018-11-20 20:22:57 A combo of tea tree oil and a carrier oil to grease your scalp with in between shampoos... I like almond oil or grapeseed with tea tree oil
3163 2018-11-20 20:22:56 Seems prophetic. Better track record than @paulkrugman
3164 2018-11-20 20:22:53 For Sure!!  And as one that uses heating oil to heat my house in the winter....Keep on selling it!!!
3165 2018-11-20 20:22:47 I do too all the oils the sell are legit af the rose oil is best
3166 2018-11-20 20:22:44 Guess he also wants to slow the US economy down as well. Oil below $50 will do just that

3171 2018-11-20 20:22:28 We have other allies with oil. SA need to be held accountable for their behaviour and sanctions might make them rethink their place in the world. However, they have invested so much $$$ in the West that they can easily disrupt markets by merely dumping those investments.
3172 2018-11-20 20:22:17 Jeeeshh... and the whole situation with Zhaire Smith is beyond me. Is it his foot or a sesame oil allergy?!
3173 2018-11-20 20:22:17 #OOTT When levers are overused, they become less effective and sometimes counterproductive. Is @realDonaldTrump overusing his twitter-lever for oil? Is he overusing sanctions-lever?

3184 2018-11-20 20:21:45 He really is a repugnant oil stain of a human. He will go down in history for all the wrong reasons 
3185 2018-11-20 20:21:36 Crude oil continues to plummet as gas prices stay stable as a rock in CA.  My cousin moved to FL and said gas is a $! cheaper there.  Me thinks taxes are one thing and pricing collusion is another.
3186 2018-11-20 20:21:29 I cant believe this imbecile is worried about something that happened over there. Just remember stupid that our oil comes from their country
3187 2018-11-20 20:21:19 the syrian oil fields that are occupied by US?
3188 2018-11-20 20:21:08 Does he even have a clue what lower oil prices mean to our domestic producers!!

3191 2018-11-20 20:20:59 And this is what happens when you have a leader with no empathy.  He doesn't care about America residents.  All he cares about is oil, arms sales & future sales of condos & Trump towers. Who cares if they're murderers.
3192 2018-11-20 20:20:58 Looking like a little strength on 5min....going to hold off, especially if oil down big again
3193 2018-11-20 20:20:52 So the guy who has the oil gets to kill whoever he wants? Amazon controls e-commerce which employs a lot of IT workers. We should let him murder occasionally because money money money.
3194 2018-11-20 20:20:48 Oil down 7% earlier. 

Crash is underway.

3195 2018-11-20 20:20:40 Trump is protecting the US-Putin-MbS oil cartel by any means necessary. Anyone is expendable. For justice sake follow the money Trump is earning.

3197 2018-11-20 20:20:36 Huh.  Did us conspiracy theorists who claimed Saudia Arabia was propping up the oil market by funding hedge fund long positions just get proved right?

@cjenscook @chigrl @RaoulGMI
3198 2018-11-20 20:20:36 Why are we surprised, they have already asked for the Iran treaty to be cancelled as it was affecting their monopoly on oil production in the region.
3199 2018-11-20 20:20:35 hes right. SA holds the key to the petrodollar that maintains demand for USD. As long as the world depends on SA oil and our house of debt is dependant on the strenght and demand of the USD then we are at the mercy of "royal" thugs. Back to the gold std anyone?

3207 2018-11-20 20:19:55 The money leads to Iran, Turkey, & Russia.

Russia lost control of the end of the Siberian oil pipeline they've used to extort $ from Europe for decades.  Their economy will collapse if they can't get it to warm-hearted ports for export.

That's why we're all fighting in Syria.

3217 2018-11-20 20:19:24 I mean I guess he could bomb them. But you would bitch about that. He could impose sanctions on their oil industry and tank the world economy. But you would criticize that. He could strongly condemn the Saudis. That wouldn’t be enough for you “principled” boomers. Whatcha you got
3218 2018-11-20 20:19:21 Yo anybody who has Crep protect spray....DO NOT SPRAY THEM ON LEATHER SHOES! You will be so upset. If you do, use coconut oil & a sock to get them back to normal.

3220 2018-11-20 20:19:17 Is it about the oil though? I thought it was about 450$ billion that the saudis promised to invest in USA?
3221 2018-11-20 20:19:12 Gotcha. Yeah imo better not to use sage. If anything use Oil but again remember that the power is from God not the oil

Saudi oil is a card at the bottom of our economic house of cards, of course he doesn’t want to pull it. So terrible.
3227 2018-11-20 20:18:54 Disgraceful in every way.  Not to undermine the severity of the crime or his outrageous lies about an oil deal. Where exactly are these low oil prices?  Big dollars at the pump!  How is this even a consideration when looking for justice for a man's life?

3230 2018-11-20 20:18:48 Hell we’re the number one oil producer now iirc. And domestic oil production would actually increase if oil prices went up since the whole “Saudi and OPEC tank price of oil ahead of Iran entering global oil market” thing put some US shale production on hold cuz no profit margin.

3242 2018-11-20 20:18:07 Your a fool.  Saudi and Israel are our biggest allies in the middle east. We have american's over there.  Does oil ring any bells to you.  There is so much more to this situation than you nuts know. But you want to start a war.  Genius.
3243 2018-11-20 20:17:57 Most of you either didn't take or weren't paying attention in #scienceclass.

Crude oil is a precursor or essential resource for almost every product and industry in the modern world.

Saudi Arabia owns the largest global supply of it.

Cut into bite-sized florets, toss with enough olive oil to coat, season with salt, pepper & (optionally) chili powder, spread it out on a pan and bake to your preferred softness. Higher heat (400C or higher) is better, so the cauliflower gets golden brown.

3260 2018-11-20 20:16:46 For one, the US has fundamentally shifted the oil market, though it doesn't really change concerns about supply since we're also sanctioning Russia (top-3 producer) and Iran (top 8 producer) and Venezuela (also important) etc. But I think it's as much about neocons as Trump.
3261 2018-11-20 20:16:43 TRUMP: HE'D LIKE OIL PRICES TO BE LOWER
3262 2018-11-20 20:16:43 I would have thought that being a corrupt former lobbyist was a plus in the eyes of the RNC, given they are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Big Oil and the NRA.
3263 2018-11-20 20:16:39 Who do cheap oil changes
3264 2018-11-20 20:16:39 Trump probably just accepts whatever Netanyahu (and supporters) told him about sticking to "Iran is the enemy, Saudi is our friend" line, right? US intel is well aware of the radical ideology source. Didn't the  West decide decades ago it was cool with terrorists if oil flows?
3265 2018-11-20 20:16:37 I only use olive oil for cooking never buy any other for cooking. I meant animal fat as in beef not all animals. Mmmmm bacon

3267 2018-11-20 20:16:25 UK Petrol Woes as the price of oil drops and fuel becomes a little bit cheaper "said no one ever", except maybe the oil companies.

3273 2018-11-20 20:16:15 #oott china stocked too much crude oil in last 6 months.. Now China will try to allocate iranian oil. What is the median of the storage value per barrel of china? I wish to know it #crudeoil #usoil #oil Thats more that important OPEC cut. Do not forget india they could not bought

3279 2018-11-20 20:15:56 I have a diffuser and I put lavender or rosemary oil in it and then a very dim light 
3280 2018-11-20 20:15:55 Wow, that last paragraph! All bow down to King Oil!
3281 2018-11-20 20:15:55 Ahhh I see - I have no background with them so I can't say if fish oil or flax seed oil would help at all, but getting your omega fatty acids is important for brain function so I'd say from personal experience, take a supplement if you aren't getting them from your diet anyways
3282 2018-11-20 20:15:54 He did like the $USD Lower too....buy $OIL!??
3283 2018-11-20 20:15:52 At this pace specs will only be short oil. Look at today's disaster.

True for regional cleptocracies & despots alike whether China, Russia or Egypt. The sooner we're off M.E. oil the better.

3290 2018-11-20 20:15:23 Trump thinks we needs oil or we do need oil?
3291 2018-11-20 20:15:19 Washing up liquid helps remove the oil but will need a couple of washes! Once all removed and feathers looking more healthy will be then suitable back for release 
3292 2018-11-20 20:15:17 A cup of each, plus a good shake of Olbas Oil should do it.

3302 2018-11-20 20:14:56 I'm arguing we don't actually get oil because oil is sold on a global market and Saudi Arabia no longer has either the market power or the appetite to drive up prices by any significant amount.
3303 2018-11-20 20:14:56 *TRUMP SAYS HE WOULD LIKE OIL PRICES TO BE LOWER

3306 2018-11-20 20:14:39 ? I'm not trying to uncover some some secret cabal here—I'm talking about what the oil industry's lobbying arm is openly doing along with its stated justification for doing it. I used the term "Big Oil" as Twitter shorthand, much as I used the Big Auto for the opposing group.
3307 2018-11-20 20:14:38 There's an oil pipeling from Grangemouth to Finnart terminal near Helensburgh. Not aware of anything to Hunterston
3308 2018-11-20 20:14:36 That's old news.  At least half the provinces are in the same sinking Titanic. The cowboys and gals from AB just can't accept the fact that they need to tax the oil producers more and live within their means. AB'ers also need introduce and accept a provincial sales tax.
3309 2018-11-20 20:14:34 You got all the oil field money

3312 2018-11-20 20:14:34 .@JustinTrudeau is a hypocrite! He is living off a trust fund because of the wealth his grandfather made from building and running gas stations! Now he wants to sabotage the oil industry in Canada.

Yet, you wonder why you were beaten so badly in the mid terms....Ты идиот
3317 2018-11-20 20:13:57 reminder that every past U.S. president and most other western leaders have always aligned with the atrocities of Saudi Arabia and ignored their crimes for oil and money; Trump's just being honest about it

Tell the EU to take a running jump and come back and we will consider what we will sell them and at what price.
3328 2018-11-20 20:13:22 While APC toys with the nation remember Nigeria is just one fall in the oil price away from a major catastrophe.
3329 2018-11-20 20:13:21 In case the only thing you know about Saudi Arabia is that they murdered Jamal Khashoggi. They are currently murdering civilians in Yemen (including children), oh, and 15 of the 19 hijackers from 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. But hey they give us oil  @realDonaldTrump
3330 2018-11-20 20:13:18 Well I know a few who got a job in NNPC, CBN, NCC & SEC who got in after a rigorous "Exams & Assessment Centre" in the past. They had no one but God.

3332 2018-11-20 20:13:15 My car needs an oil change, to be washed and detailed, but my baby wants a toy so guess who’s fixing the car by hand and getting my baby a toy.
3333 2018-11-20 20:13:13 But fracking is already doing the work of flooding markets with oil for him. So thoroughly ugly.
3334 2018-11-20 20:13:03 So Iran buys oil from Russia? Seriously? 
3335 2018-11-20 20:13:03 I hope we could get it, the legal one,not the oil they sell just now as it’s not the proper one because it isn’t legal here yet , I definitely want to give it a go & hopefully it will help with the pain, depression & Anxiety & my other health issues #legaliseCanibisOil #SelfCare

3340 2018-11-20 20:12:35 Thanksgiving is a time to come together as a family and agree that it's OK for a world leader to commit murder if they have a lot of oil.
3341 2018-11-20 20:12:33 @prayingmedic I was watching the turkey that was pardoned- and God showed me donald was a duck and covered with oil- i heard that before somewhere- I didn't realize the oil was God's Anointing oil- and what ever they do or say against him- returns and happens to them-

Post 91 instead of disclosure, all in on maximizing the business end potential of petrodollar system implementing neoconservative/4th Reich agenda tying oil with national security. Global security consequences have been devastating.

3351 2018-11-20 20:12:00 Bullshit. Unless the us is responsible for 666. We must always have the upper hand. Now we just do what we are told by Israel, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Pull our bases out a there get our oil from Alaska and Canada. Let them fight own battles.
3352 2018-11-20 20:12:00 America first by relying on foreign oil...WTF?
3353 2018-11-20 20:12:00 I think CEO said it best - Fish oil studies failed - Vascepa produced results - that is your study against fish oil.
3354 2018-11-20 20:11:54 we NEED fossil fuel companies for heart valves; millions would die in brownouts; energy use is the driving force behind moral progress; oil executives are paid more because they know best; coloridians NEED natural gas for heat in winter; we NEED the cooperation of oil executives.
3355 2018-11-20 20:11:47 Well the bigger issue is transportation is largely hinges on cars/personal transportation. Big oil and car industry fucked up mass transportation. Would greatly reduce general traffic and deaths

3365 2018-11-20 20:11:18 So Trump is going to stick with the Saudis if they don't cut oil production. Here comes another oil glut.

3370 2018-11-20 20:11:06 If you're cooking your onions in water then you're literally just boiling them. Water is limited to 100C / 212F. The advantage of using cooking oil is that it can go up to 400F, a temp where the onions brown and you get much more flavor.
3371 2018-11-20 20:11:05 Got new tires, wipers blades, headlights, and an oil change this week. So that means I’m definitely gonna total this car soon
3372 2018-11-20 20:10:44 @realDonaldTrump hey buddy, the Saudis are NOT our allies. Saudis = 911. Fact. We have enough of our own oil, we don't need their oil. Punish them for their atrocities. You are making the USA look weak and retarded.
3373 2018-11-20 20:10:31 Yea.    They are 100% oil concentrate,no fillers and lasts a minimum of 48hrs......A trial will convince you.

3380 2018-11-20 20:10:03 you'll never know the pain of having to mix gas and oil on a 2 cycle snowblower, opening the choke, priming it, and yanking harder to kickstart that little shit and hoping you don't run into so much snow it stalls out and having to do all that before you can go anywhere.

3387 2018-11-20 20:09:37 I've had a bearish oil call all year, do it's strange to say this:

Oil is oversold. Prices will recover prior to year end.
3388 2018-11-20 20:09:34 it’s a real double-edged turd. I try to stay away from large groups and I dab thieves oil under my nose during flu season. I also regularly take a shot of black walnut tincture. It sounds like a buncha hooey, but it’s worked for all the years I’ve taken it.

This time I'll put it in question form.  

1.  Which products and industries depend on crude oil as a resource?

2.  Who owns the largest global supply of crude oil?

So...life as you know it or Kashoggi.  #Choose
3392 2018-11-20 20:09:21 You planning on PARDONING Investors or just looking the other way on MURDER FOR OIL PRICES???
3393 2018-11-20 20:09:21 Do you think SA will stop selling oil if we stop allying with them? That would hurt them more than it hurts us. OPEC no longer has the same market power they once had.
3394 2018-11-20 20:09:17 Omega3's are important but not a medicinal fix for any aliments, not sure what the "brain zaps" are but I do take flax seed oil as a supplement for omega fatty acids because I don't get many from my diet due to allergies, it does help with concentration and retention

3396 2018-11-20 20:09:14 I've never been a fan of Justin's belief that deficits can be conquered by growing the economy; I thought it was foolishness the first time I heard it. It's saner than Harper's belief that cutting taxes is a panacea, but I still think voters picked the second-worst option.
3397 2018-11-20 20:09:00 Lidl is even better - best olive oil, all basics and some wonderful bargains if you catch them.

3401 2018-11-20 20:08:46 What place is that? Our decreasing dependence on their oil? Or the fact that they’ve been buying our military hardware for 30 years and the idea that they can just switch to some other country is absurd because the systems they have can’t communicate with other nations systems?

3411 2018-11-20 20:07:53 They keep changing the oil but the never address the check engine light
3412 2018-11-20 20:07:50 Is it not amazing what tons and tons of oil will do to one's perspective.  I know tons is not right but you get the picture.
3413 2018-11-20 20:07:42 Oh mic is just a quick way. Do try the tin foil with salt and oil makes deliciously crispy skin and the spud is nice fluffy.
3414 2018-11-20 20:07:40 I’ve been eating great. No meat, 100% fruit juices, water and teas. Taking hemp oil. Trying not to consume animal products. Has my body feeling good.
3415 2018-11-20 20:07:34 Or we just admit that #gunsense is so much snake oil. Disarming good people doesn't make us safer. We need to fix mental health and get tough on domestic abusers.
3416 2018-11-20 20:07:32 @pepboysauto I got an oil change a few weeks ago and I went to add washer fluid today, noticed my OIL CAP off and closed in my hood, making it nearly impossible to open- the whole engine and everything around it is soaked with oil now. I’ve been driving like this for WEEKS.
3417 2018-11-20 20:07:30 There will be no substantive change in our relationship with the Saudi’s, Jimmy Carter tried to get tough with the Saudi’s, result, oil embargo followed by losing presidency. We import about 900,000. barrels day
3418 2018-11-20 20:07:28 Are Canuckistan oil bbls pricing negative yet? 

Asking for a friend. Politely.

#OOTT
3419 2018-11-20 20:07:27 yup! Spoon full of butter and a spoon full of coconut oil. If i have it, ill add a splash of 35% Milk Fat whipping cream
3420 2018-11-20 20:07:27 I got the spray from target and the oils from the hair store! The wild growth oil is in a white bottle with red top, but they also have a this like extra one (I never used it before) but it’s in a yellow bottle
3421 2018-11-20 20:07:22 Ohh God
This kind of food is pure love
Did u see the oil they poured on top of it
3422 2018-11-20 20:07:22 Show me on the chart where Oil touched you today
3423 2018-11-20 20:07:20 Trump is protecting the US-Putin-MbS oil cartel by any means necessary. Anyone is expendable.
For justice sake follow the money Trump is earning.
3424 2018-11-20 20:07:20 Depressing we voted for something that the Government did not want to deliver. We cant carry on with the politicians we have its pathetic , once great nation run by snake oil salesmen
3425 2018-11-20 20:07:05 Do we jepodise our relationship with a key Middle East partner who spends billions with us and provides the world oil supply.  Saudia Arabia could destroy the world economy if we choose to press the journalist killing.
3426 2018-11-20 20:07:02 At least we have seen editorials for recruitment into NNPC, NCC, CBN, NDIC, PTDF, SEC, NHIS et al in the not too distant past and know a 'few' who applied and got offers in the end without knowing anybody.
3427 2018-11-20 20:07:01 Just because he sells snake oil doesn't mean he personally samples it. (Forgive me if he has done so on video or something. I certainly am not going to watch any of his videos or read more than the few damning quotes I've seen from him.)
3428 2018-11-20 20:06:56 Mmmmmmmmmm feta!!! Drizzled with a little olive oil and sprinkled with some oregano on top, bowl of kalamata olives and a hunk of good bread and you have a meal right there!!!!!
3429 2018-11-20 20:06:56 We have a couple of elderly patients in the extended family who use CBD oil as a painkiller, not to get high. 

Works for them, because they are in permanent pain and the oil is less harsh eg on stomach, liver and kidneys than normal painkillers when used daily.
3430 2018-11-20 20:06:55 AS I WAS SAYING KO MY INTERVIEW JUST NOW,KE REKISA BEARD OIL BAGAETSHO !!! le chaele di boyfriend tsanyena hao bo ousy.
3431 2018-11-20 20:06:52 Coffee with butter and coconut oil is like cocaine
3432 2018-11-20 20:06:45 I just... I just wanna paint fancy oil paintings of fanarts. Like full portraits of people that don't exist... But nobody would want these things. xD
3433 2018-11-20 20:06:43 Me too. I'm forever checking labels to make sure I'm not  using things that contain non sustainable palm oil but it's so hard to avoid. I saw first hand what damage it was doing to the rainforests and it is truly devastating 
3434 2018-11-20 20:06:40 Fair enough, although I should be honest, I don’t think I’ve seen a recipe call for olive oil now that I’m thinking about it.
3435 2018-11-20 20:06:39 Recipe is easy as:  depending on how wide is the tray.. I use 3 measuring cup of Cacao powder with 2 m cup of coconut oil (no carbs there).. 2to 3 tspns pure vanilla essence.. baking paper in tray with blue/black berries spread closely across the paper..
3436 2018-11-20 20:06:39 IMO the other lie is creative destruction will replace these lost jobs on a 1 for 1 basis.
A. Many of these workers are not compatible with higher tech jobs for various reasons.
B. Objective, elimination of human labor,  shifting labor doesnt accomplish this
3437 2018-11-20 20:06:35 Funny thing @vinnybrowne i had some CBD oil but ended up giving to it @Hibbeh7 a few month's back ! :D
3438 2018-11-20 20:06:35 Uncertainty is the biggest enemy of economy. 
IMF ki demands apni jaga. Asad Umar & Team ki team negotiate krey. 60 USD se kam crude oil rha tu Saudia k lye bht prob hu jaye gi.  
-Crude Oil 2-3 yr k lowest py hy, petrol prices kam krey Govt.
3439 2018-11-20 20:06:33 Yet we keep buying it and selling our oil for sweet fuck all.  Dear Ottawa.....math much?
3440 2018-11-20 20:06:33 The administration openly admitting that defense contracts and oil are the reasons it is standing with Saudi Arabia after the brutal murder of #Khashoggi brings to mind Benjamin Franklin's warning "Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor Liberty to purchase power." #SaudiArabia
3441 2018-11-20 20:06:30 Most outside the oil industry aren't aware the Saudi conducted an intentiontial oil war with US producers when technology gains in 2012-2013 allowed much increased/safer US production.  They lowered prices continuing for so long they ran deficits & had to borrow for the 1st time.
3442 2018-11-20 20:06:30 FACT Canada sold its Oil interests to American companies long ago. We do not control our fate.
3443 2018-11-20 20:06:28 Saudi has money and Oil and they are willing to act more civil than Iran. 

That’s the odds
3444 2018-11-20 20:06:26 It's not what they have on him; it's that they have control of THE FUEL OIL that the world is still very dependent on! THAT'S why they're allowed to get away with countless human rights violations!
3445 2018-11-20 20:06:24 Without money from oil, Saudis would just ride camels in the sand and drink tea. They don't even know how to make a spoon. Saudi Arabia is a medieval kingdom, rich by accident.
3446 2018-11-20 20:06:07 @CadburyUK following the recent press about Palm Oil, I was surprised to find your products contain it, when will you be replacing it with another product?
3447 2018-11-20 20:06:06 The U.S. EPA granted oil major Chevron Corp  a 2017 hardship waiver from the nation's biofuel laws for its Utah plant earlier this year, source tell me and @ChrisPrentice
3448 2018-11-20 20:06:03 coconut oil is my go to makeup remover for everything especially stubborn waterproof liners/mascaras
3449 2018-11-20 20:05:56 I got into my car, & right before I started it, I suddenly felt the need to check the oil. When I lifted tge hood, I found my cat Reagan chilling out on the battery. Please check under you hoods & make sure no animals are there!! Thank God the cat wasn't hurt!!
3450 2018-11-20 20:05:47 EVOO is the only essential oil I need.
3451 2018-11-20 20:05:42 Up to that tag match i was unbeaten but yeah I'll give you some baby oil to shine that head of yours
3452 2018-11-20 20:05:34 Deep frying a turkey is incredibly fun (if you do it right and don't burn down your hourse) and tastes great. Plus while the oil is heating up you can fry all sorts of other stuff for snacks--french fries, onion rings, vegetables, twinkies. Did it for a number of years w/friends.
3453 2018-11-20 20:05:29 You have to wonder what action would be too outrageous to be acceptable even to Trump. Where's the line? He doesn't seem to have one. Anything goes. Kill someone and chop them up? Sure, no problem. He needs their money and oil.
3454 2018-11-20 20:05:20 I read here on Twitter about the cat chow. Calli & Jesse love it, so I buy the huge bag. If the birds & chipmunks like it, that'll save me between $20-$80 a month on seed. Popcorn & oil are cheap. I can get 2 bags of popcorn & bottle of oil for about $6. That lasts about a month.
3455 2018-11-20 20:05:18 I know their oil is important, but it's not worth selling your soul to the devil.
3456 2018-11-20 20:05:15 A Fiat 850. I sold my cycle to buy it. I think it used more oil than petrol.
3457 2018-11-20 20:05:07 I'm not sure. That's the frustrating part. If Saudi Arabia didn't have oil, a strategically advantageous geography, and wasn't as financially entwined with us as they are, we'd probably sanction them North Korea-style. But that isn't the case so...I dunno.
3458 2018-11-20 20:04:58 Cake mix cookies are super easy & low cost - box of cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup oil. Can get creative and add other toppings if you have them on hand, or keep it simple. I've subbed applesauce/bananas for the eggs & oil before in a pinch as well.
3459 2018-11-20 20:04:55 So proud of @JustinTrudeau for taking a stand against Saudi Arabia and their gruesome murder of journalist #Khashoggi @realDonaldTrump supports state-sponsored assassinations. All he cares about is oil & money! Proud Canadian 
3460 2018-11-20 20:04:51 Leave baby oil on for 30/40 minutes, then have a bath and exfoliate to get it off!
3461 2018-11-20 20:04:50 Still have a bit of rhodium, expecting low oil and gasoline prices to bode well for catalytic converters. So long as auto sales don't slow too much. #Platinum

3464 2018-11-20 20:04:25 Trump Need Saudi Arabia regarding the oil. He damage the supply of oil from Iran. He sold the soul of the USA. The stock market realize it just in time
3465 2018-11-20 20:04:19 Sure you are inundated already but just to let you know @Oreo you won’t be welcome in my biscuit jar anymore. @Greenpeace @christoff_RVN No to palm oil! No to ripping up habitats Thank you @IcelandFoods
3466 2018-11-20 20:04:18 This is true, but if all you can get is dried, you can still get some decent flavor out of them by cooking them a few minutes in butter or oil before use
3467 2018-11-20 20:04:12 What province
3468 2018-11-20 20:04:05 Welcome to the group of war criminals.  #SaudiArabia #YemenGenocide #Iraq #Libya $$$$ for oil . . . you should all be tried at the #Hague
3469 2018-11-20 20:03:56 Ahhh... I tend to steer from that microwave but I pre boiled and pre heated oil in the glass pan. Add the tators n flipped every 12 mins I think it was... tanks for the tip
3470 2018-11-20 20:03:56 He never knows anything.... Even when Deziani was loot oil and dollars, and the 20 billion dollars "America will know".. Gentleman but sharp at all for the post of presidency
3471 2018-11-20 20:03:55 the whipped shea butter and avocado oil got my hair feeling soft .. ima update y’all in a couple of days 
3472 2018-11-20 20:03:45 Seeley your chairman must be in with the oil trade !!
3473 2018-11-20 20:03:37 Wait so what oil should we be using?  I pan sear a lot of steak and chicken
3474 2018-11-20 20:03:35 In Maldives 
If sick - drink coconut water
If Sunburn - apply Conut oil 
If Cooking Curry - add coconut milk

Etc....
Everything is Coconut  brw
3475 2018-11-20 20:03:35 Why not choose neither? Oil my ass, just lower the military budget and give the DoE $100 billion to research algae oil, Gen IV reactors like those that use thorium, and nuclear fusion.
3476 2018-11-20 20:03:35 Insufficient spending on the infrastructure required to do a proper job running things. Nice to see Lord hasn't fallen prey to learning from experience.
3477 2018-11-20 20:03:31 @Bob_Dolemite most of brzu is not oil. It is banking and metals.
3478 2018-11-20 20:03:28 Butter and coconut oil 
3479 2018-11-20 20:03:21 So someone who fought in the Iraq war oil was the most important thing in their lives ?
3480 2018-11-20 20:03:19 Trump is protecting the US-Putin-MbS oil cartel by any means necessary. Anyone is expendable.
3481 2018-11-20 20:03:15 its oil now
3482 2018-11-20 20:03:06 I’ve used olive oil in cooking, but mostly when it’s on a stove top.
Never used anything other than basic olive oil, and if I were to ever use extra virgin for anything, it would be if a recipe explicitly says to.
3483 2018-11-20 20:03:03 Very uncomfortable watching Bill Walton oil Jay Bilas’ back. He def touched his bum too 
3484 2018-11-20 20:03:01 You have sold it to me. Palm oil makes me sick to my stomach

3490 2018-11-20 20:02:36 Most Americans disagree. We have not accepted your propaganda. Take your oil and SUCK IT. Oil is ALL you have. Saudi Arabia has a DICTATOR. They call him "Royal".
3491 2018-11-20 20:02:36 "Have you ever had a massage? Would you like one? Do you have any body oil in your bag?"
3492 2018-11-20 20:02:36 Yeah if you want to keep the price of oil down you will
3493 2018-11-20 20:02:30 Depends on how many oil fires they expect in a lobby. Probably just stick with handheld ABCs
3494 2018-11-20 20:02:26 I've taken to... broiling?.. instead of using oil. when cooking on the stove. I get a nice consistency out of my onions if I just cook them in shallow, replenishing layer of hot water.
3495 2018-11-20 20:02:26 Iont Kno Who Needed To Hear This But  Go Get Ur Gf A Oil Change If Yu Gon B Drivin Her Shit Everyday
3496 2018-11-20 20:02:21 Its an incredible place. The vast areas of palm oil are heartbreaking but the pristine jungle is stunning. Orangutans, gibbons, langurs, forest elephants, hornbills, clouded leopard and sunbears all frequented the area around our camp. So special. Defo go if you get the chance x
3497 2018-11-20 20:02:20 They got the oil money and they know how to funnel it to their puppets. If #trump ever sobers up enough we might find ourselves in a new ME war.
3498 2018-11-20 20:02:15 If we're to continue obscuring history on our banknotes, could the next rewrite replace that foreign ruler currently on our $20?
3499 2018-11-20 20:02:11 I remember that date, oil bottomed when I gave up all hope. Kind of like the way I feel now. #oott
3500 2018-11-20 20:02:02 Maybe @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP could give one of those Turkeys (I suggest the one name Donald) to our good Buddy  ally's the Saudi's. They already know how to kill, feather, cook in oil.
3501 2018-11-20 20:01:54 yes. try an argan oil first to see if you like it. it's very light. (my face is oily too)

i put a few drops in with my moisturizer & spf in the morning & evening.
3502 2018-11-20 20:01:46 Okay but what if I put hot sauce in an essential oil diffuser
3503 2018-11-20 20:01:31 I keep all types of lip balm, lip gloss, Vaseline, lip oil, all that shit on me AND I do lip scrubs every week especially in the winter time. I HATE dry, crusty lips

3505 2018-11-20 20:01:20 It's not that sketchy. Most turkey-frying disasters result from very stupid people throwing frozen turkeys into hot oil.
3506 2018-11-20 20:01:15 You’re going to regret asking - I use N African spices (Bart’s Ras al Hanout ready mixed is ok), preserved lemons, a little olive oil and lots of red wine. I cover throughout cooking in a very low oven (150) for 5 hours plus. Take off fat & reduce.
3507 2018-11-20 20:01:12 Well, no. The US has been backing the evil Saudis since the 1930s, when it engaged them in order to prop-up Standard Oil.
3508 2018-11-20 20:01:12 Read well, before commenting.

3511 2018-11-20 20:01:04 Can't say I'm happy to see our first prime minister removed entirely and replaced with an historical footnote. I wasn't a fan of the village-bicycle $10 either, nor of the facelifts Harper gave to every portrait.

3513 2018-11-20 20:01:01 2/ Daniel Pearl was a citizen. We have oil interest with SA. You are the same people that will scream the loudest if the $ of gas goes to $10 and the econ. goes into deep recession. Geopolitics with S.A. is a lot more complicated because they determine $ of oil.

3515 2018-11-20 20:00:56 I stopped using any products with aluminium, make up & sunscreens all have a bunch of nasties in them, I used to spend huge amounts of money on these fancy products, now it's just coconut oil & it works far better than the most expensive cosmetics IMHO
3516 2018-11-20 20:00:53 If the Oilers don’t make the playoffs this yr then Chiarelli has to be gone.  What a mess in Oil country!

3522 2018-11-20 20:00:43 W. Bush already allowed the Saudis to attack the US on 9/11. Saudi oil money has already bought most of the House while Russian oil money has bought the Senate. So what else is new?
3523 2018-11-20 20:00:41 “Puppet” or not, we know that Trump did money laundering for Russian oligarchs and put the head of exxon mobil as secretary of state in an attempt to get their oil deal done.
3524 2018-11-20 20:00:40 Once again, oil & money over blood being shed. Saudis aren't our friends, their school books have Death 2 America but @potus is so ignorant of this fact. they don't need more arms to kill Yemeni children. @potus  didn't have the stomach to hear the tape of the killing .Disgust

3527 2018-11-20 20:00:35 As much as I wish the US government would’ve severed ties with Saudi Arabia for the Koshiggi murder, I knew it would never happen. Oil is too important to the US, far more important than lives. Our government, Dem and Rep, have proved this time and time again

3536 2018-11-20 19:59:59 Not good...you're actually cooking iron into your food, which can cause toxicity. Also, frying with oil in cast iron causes foods to become rancid and more inviting to harmful bacteria.

3540 2018-11-20 19:59:53 These are not only the jobs Americans won't do, they are the jobs illegal aliens won't do. 
Why should they when they can get better paying jobs in other industries that are not seasonal and don't require moving around?
3541 2018-11-20 19:59:50 My old Oil job boss, who was on a 6 figure salary, drove up from England in a Porche 2-3x a week. He got the sack for double-jobbing (he was selling work from our Aberdeen office at low rates to his *other job* down south)
He succeeded in bankrupting our department then f*kd off.
3542 2018-11-20 19:59:48 considering the amount of people killed in USA due to Trumps gun Laws
It comes as no surprise this decision 
ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY/OIL
3543 2018-11-20 19:59:47 You're of the opinion that lower global oil prices are *bad* for us?

Or that customers are *bad* for us?
3544 2018-11-20 19:59:45 If I use any oil in cooking you should be proud of me.
3545 2018-11-20 19:59:43 If palm oil from eru hasn’t ruin your teeth to date, I’ll be just fine with coffee in 40years 
3546 2018-11-20 19:59:43 Our current oil prices are being manipulated thanks to those legislators helping the fossil fuel industry. For a few years it was well known that the oversupply was causing great drops in revenue.  Trump gets elected and "voila!" oil prices climb, in spite of diminishing demands
3547 2018-11-20 19:59:38 Solar and wind power would make their oil "not so important" and BTW, RIGHT NOW NEITHER IS THE DOLT!
3548 2018-11-20 19:59:26 Na German beans and Dubai oil she take make that one oh 
3549 2018-11-20 19:59:24 #oott. If you were a member of OPEC+ group would you sell oil at this price which is down 25% from 7 week’s ago?
3550 2018-11-20 19:59:19 “Surely I won’t spend that much money over thanksgiving break...”

*does every activity humanly possible that requires money and forgets I’m 3,000 miles overdue for an oil change*

And it’s only Tuesday. 
RIP bank account 
3551 2018-11-20 19:59:12 Why not just trade guns for oil at this point and cut out the exchange rate issues.
3552 2018-11-20 19:59:12 Trump is said to be “transactional”. 

Here’s what that means:

If the Saudis want to murder you, Trump will agree to it as long as they don’t raise oil prices.
3553 2018-11-20 19:59:03 That's the problem with some of us. All these years we have heard northerners run all the oil blocks. This list (as well as others previously published) shows it's all been a lie. Now you want to bring in another angle of the northerners benefiting from a new bid. Stop the lies!

3555 2018-11-20 19:58:54 The first episode of  #DogsOnNetflix that family should consider CBD Oil.
3556 2018-11-20 19:58:51 We recognize that few car owners have the time or equipment necessary to complete all their auto repairs and maintenance at home. When you want to keep your car’s engine happily purring, our oil and lube services are always available to help.
3557 2018-11-20 19:58:51 Conspicuously, it seems even Prohibition was a pretext to put ethanol burning engines out of business. Sure, it was "sold" as some "moral movement" but it was a plot to make any POTENTIAL competitor to Big Oil FAIL. 

Is this just another example of such unbridled greed? I fancy.
3558 2018-11-20 19:58:50 Their wings, the Dee Snider burger  And get the fries with truffle oil!
3559 2018-11-20 19:58:43 Same as my slow cooked kid goat: bed of sliced onion, carrot and celery with a few whole garlics + glass water. Stab holes and poke in half garlic clove, rub with EV olive oil + yr spice choice. Cook 140c 4 hrs, last 20 mins hotter
3560 2018-11-20 19:58:43 I went to pick up my car bc I got an oil change & the guy who gave me car saw me & pulled the seat closer.. LOL RUDE but thanks

3562 2018-11-20 19:58:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3563 2018-11-20 19:58:28 Why is this such an artistic collage tho and why do I want it oil painted and hung on my wall #Number1Fan
3564 2018-11-20 19:58:15 It means that growth cannot continue at the same rate forever. It also shows that U.S. oil supply growth is largely a bet on the Permian basin.
3565 2018-11-20 19:58:04 Can’t believe i forgot to pack my tea tree oil 
3566 2018-11-20 19:58:00 Space joints, mini mints, concentrate, syringes, cartridges, and cannabis oil infused chocolates; have you tried them all? What are you missing?
3567 2018-11-20 19:57:52 Ben you are a special kind of fool. What actions do you want taken on Saudi Arabia which is the largest producer of oil and can collapse the world economy right now if they wanted to.

3570 2018-11-20 19:57:33 "Our intelligence agencies continue to assess". He is waiting for the facts b4 he does something rash like sanctioning a major oil supplier. The left just wants to find a reason to hate this man.
3571 2018-11-20 19:57:31 Looks like #markets are pricing in a big #Oil glut next year. That is unlikely to happen unless a recession kicks in or China and India slowdown abruptly. #OOTT
3572 2018-11-20 19:57:14 Have to make a mini graphic novel for uni on palm oil
3573 2018-11-20 19:57:12 It took us four times to get it right. You have to oil/grease the grill pads prior to using and move the meat on the grill more than you would on a regular grill. More like pan frying with a panini press. It's very different.
3574 2018-11-20 19:57:11 While the media vilified H for months, Trump exploited the networks to gain free air time. (He was just down the street in NY)
Time to become more discerning about what is real news and what is blather sold by a snake oil salesman.
3575 2018-11-20 19:57:09 What if an oil company funded the research, would you believe it then?
3576 2018-11-20 19:57:07 How long before the first long $tsla claims all these agencies are shorting $tsla or are paid by oil or are just haters?
3577 2018-11-20 19:57:05 It's a good point. I think the performance of placebo in other trials may be the strongest argument that's been made that the mineral oil placebo doesn't matter. (It may matter, but I acknowledge that analysis is a good defense.
3578 2018-11-20 19:57:00 Oil drops to $53.30 per barrel... Gas today is under $2.00 a gallon  if it goes up because of a holiday, that's "Price Gouging". Should places that raise the price during a holiday be fined?
3579 2018-11-20 19:56:47 Oil down 6.5% today. Smells like liquidation of positions somewhere.
3580 2018-11-20 19:56:47 Man CBD oil saved my life
3581 2018-11-20 19:56:46 Or the Labour party, 3 day week was about oil shortage
3582 2018-11-20 19:56:45 What money. Are you referring to oil and trade deals. Does he even know that Korea is totally laughing their ass off and setting up new missile bases and can't we charge him as a traitor. Three times he's food on foreign soil and attacked every American institution my daily theme
3583 2018-11-20 19:56:44 Onions lettuce  tomato  oil vinegar and spices #JMSweepstakes Mike's way
3584 2018-11-20 19:56:40 Enjoy! Glad we had rain, it made the heating oil delivery easier. We live at the end of a half mile dirt road, muddy but passable.  
3585 2018-11-20 19:56:35 Those potatoes are the roast of jacket ones ? If jacket tin foil salt oil will crisp them up better for you makes them taste nicer for me. Quick way to do this is microwave them make sure you prick them with a fork then 1 hour in the oven have them a lot with a chilli con carne
3586 2018-11-20 19:56:32 No problem! And argon oil and biotin! And try to not put a lot of heat! That’s how I got mine to grow.
3587 2018-11-20 19:56:31 All gains from 2018 erased. Oil has tanked too.
3588 2018-11-20 19:56:19 Still looking forward to the day when transportation is electrified, our economy doesn’t depend on oil, and oil is a minor commodity not worth protecting.
3589 2018-11-20 19:56:18 One of these days, someone has to put a stop  to all the oil prospecting in the arctic wildlife refuge. It’s high time that fossil fuels are phased out for good. The arctic wildlife refuge must be protected no matter what.
3590 2018-11-20 19:56:09 Lol. It’s def written by Trump. Same points same language. Summary: “we don’t care about whom killed and why. Maybe and maybe not, but they have a lot of oil, so we like them. It’s called Money First. ”
3591 2018-11-20 19:56:08 They have to be fresh out the oil to get the best taste
3592 2018-11-20 19:55:55 They do if the have oil.
3593 2018-11-20 19:55:52 Shale struggled in 2016 , but different picture as a lot of the big players are holding but they will turn on taps to lower cost plays and cut capes on higher. Oil price fair price is higher globally, shale produces a fraction of total oil
3594 2018-11-20 19:55:50 Ang nakakapag alala ay kung maglalagay ng underground pipe sa sea floor ng WPS.
Kaya hindi tama na ipama manage natin sa iba ang oil exploration.
3595 2018-11-20 19:55:49 I agree oil spills are not good.
3596 2018-11-20 19:55:43 I'm happy to see that President Trump is not going to punish Saudi Arabia. Oil is important, as are some of our other deals with them. Best to keep the peace.
3597 2018-11-20 19:55:39 CLEAR YOUR HEAAAAD
SO SELF CENTERED YET YOURE VERY WELL REAAAAD
LEAVE YOUR BEEEED
ALL THAT OIL GONNA KILL YOU DEAAAD
3598 2018-11-20 19:55:37 So I’m getting an oil change and a technician came into the waiting room and said “hey whoever drives the Ford Escape (me), are you handing out those Hooters calendars you got in back? How can I get one? I’m just wonderin”
3599 2018-11-20 19:55:31 What would you want the price of oil to skyrocket? Gas prices have just begun to go down. Wise decision to me for Americans
3600 2018-11-20 19:55:30 Big oil is kind of screwed no matter what happens in the next five years, regardless of this issue. If oil price jumps to $100 a barrel, then gasoline will hit $4+ and accelerate the move to EVs. If price collapses, they go bankrupt.
3601 2018-11-20 19:55:29 #Oil price hits lowest in more than a year #WTI closes down $3.77 to $53.43 #LosAngeles regular gas price average now $3.66 #Dow down 550 #consumers #stocks @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney @KilduffReport @GasBuddyGuy
3602 2018-11-20 19:55:29 Oil for one.
3603 2018-11-20 19:55:14 "We will keep hands out of the hands of criminals by working on the assumption that no form of gun control will ever work." Thoughts and prayers, anyone?
3604 2018-11-20 19:55:11 So he is calling for corporate collusion? 
Odd how supply management is horrible unless its oil
3605 2018-11-20 19:55:04 Everyone should know the US works on what the best interests mean for the US. It is usually about energy—-oil & gas, the military industry, or big banks. That’s about it. So this case is called collateral damage. Casualty of war on terror.
3606 2018-11-20 19:55:04 Why do most scientists and every major scientific climate body disagree? Why do even oil companies disagree with you?
3607 2018-11-20 19:55:02 Soya bean although peanut oil also would work with similar results and taste
3608 2018-11-20 19:54:58 Free for all in the Bakken oil fields. Merica drawing it down hard. The worst light pollution area in the world. God knows what else.
3609 2018-11-20 19:54:51 The big issue for most of us will be lack of the specific qualifications and experience. Recently met some expat oil workers from SA here in Kampala. How do we get our people skilled to get some of these jobs?
3610 2018-11-20 19:54:49 sssshhhh.....
sharing a "midnight oil" secret with my sassy sisters in my Deborah J Holliday, Life Coach chat room...check it out! — feeling excited
3611 2018-11-20 19:54:45 Your post reads like inspirational poster word salad. The video shoots up to the empty buildings, because the streets are all empty. All you have is empty skyscrapers, oil, sand, and 120° summer days. When you run out of oil, you are up shit creek. #ClimateChangeIsReal
3612 2018-11-20 19:54:44 MBS is a murderous thug, but he buys lots of weapons from and supplies lots of oil to U.S. so meh...
3613 2018-11-20 19:54:38 If only the Central Park Five were oil producers
3614 2018-11-20 19:54:30 This is really sad and shows where Notley's concerns really play. Topp should be stopped before he does more damage to the oil patch. The guy is a despicable, undesirable socialist hypocrite, of the highest order!
3615 2018-11-20 19:54:27 It would be amazing to have them support the @GreenPartyUS drafted #GreenNewDeal. I hate to see one watered down by a capitalist party funded by big oil #BeBold #GoGreen
3616 2018-11-20 19:54:19 CBD oil is legal in many states and is a well known way to counteract the seizures with no high feeling at all
3617 2018-11-20 19:54:11 According to Bloomberg, only three men control the price of oil in the world. 

Putin

MBS

Trump.
3618 2018-11-20 19:54:05 Maybe we should be demanding that Steve Williams and his kind abandon " air barrels "  and stop storing their oil and buying on the cheap from the small players  then re-selling at a higher price.
3619 2018-11-20 19:53:56 Agreed.  I'm paying $3.56 a gallon for heating oil.  I don't want to pay $6.00 a gallon.
3620 2018-11-20 19:53:50 My mum has been using cannabis oil to manage her post op and lung cancer pain for a while now....its really helped her when other big pharma drugs didn't.

3625 2018-11-20 19:53:23 Funny how he think he's a game player, only if he knows he is just an ordinary "oil changer"
3626 2018-11-20 19:53:18 Interesting comment but Eastern Canada doesn’t want to support Canada with its oil supply. They prefer to buy from Saudi Arabia or the USA
3627 2018-11-20 19:53:18 He ended Iran nuclear deal and put sanctions on them, he dropped MOB Assad gassing his own people he means business. In thIs case he is being smart so price of oil won’t skyrocket.

3630 2018-11-20 19:53:06 And let me be clear, I understand that CBD oil has a plethora of benefits and I’m happy this ice cream can help people who are in pain. But do not say cannibis when you mean CBD. You know damn well people are going to get confused.
3631 2018-11-20 19:53:03 @sharicedavids As a constituent I urge you to join other Members of Congress & support the #GreenNewDeal. Climate disaster affects the least advantaged, forced 2 live near oil & gas operations at great risk. Relatives @ Standing Rock sacrificed much. Stand w them & all of us. TY!
3632 2018-11-20 19:53:03 Shall we compare total share of debt from Conservative governments vs. total share of debts due to Liberal governments? Or should we stick to the last government that actually reduced the debt?
3633 2018-11-20 19:52:46 It's a mean, nasty world out there, that's certainly true.

But we SHOULD be using our clout to make it less nasty when possible. And considering that we're an net-exporter of oil, it's entirely possible. It might hurt to do the right thing, but we'd survive.
3634 2018-11-20 19:52:39 This also fits the incredibly liquidity crisis effecting everything from #ES_F futures to Milk & Oil futures. If its the case, it further emphasizes what can only likely be a credit event of magnitude going on. Finally, IF CREDIT is CONTRACTING enough virtually all assets drop /2
3635 2018-11-20 19:52:37 BREAKING: Donald Trump Vows to Journalists That If He Had to Choose Between Them and Big Oil, He Would Choose Big Oil Every Time
3636 2018-11-20 19:52:35 i completely had forgotten that had happened until now thanks!
I'm pretty sure i was one of the people joking that it was just straight up oil
3637 2018-11-20 19:52:29 He needs the Arabs for the oil.
3638 2018-11-20 19:52:29 Girlllll your not bald head but 1. That juices and berries spray is heavenly! 
2. Wild growth oil and Jamaican black castor oil 
3. I used the Indian clay mask mixed with some tumeric in my hair as well. 
4. Wigs and protective styles. Yup that’s it’s 
3639 2018-11-20 19:52:25 America is an accomplice to Saudi Arabia. Trump gave Saudi Arabia the "It's okay if you kill our journalist", and oil prices drop. America's soul has been stolen by evil and sold to the other Devil's on earth. We are being appeased with cheap gas in order to remain complicit.
3640 2018-11-20 19:52:24 Lmao can we start a go fund me to buy him a cleansing oil he needs one holy fuck
3641 2018-11-20 19:52:20 Not all progressives are bad at math, and while $322 is certainly far less than they deserve, getting Wall Street to give the ex-employees anything at all should be considered somewhat of a win. Don’t let this silence us, I’ll still boycott any new ToysRUs until they get it all!
3642 2018-11-20 19:52:11 It always comes back to oil, and oil money, the oil based economy

3646 2018-11-20 19:51:58 I don’t use palm oil for health reasons. This makes me thankful that I don’t... And won’t! F Oreos!
3647 2018-11-20 19:51:55 One reason why we tolerate Saudi Arabia:  easy math

US daily oil consumption:  20 million barrels 

US daily oil production:  10 million barrels
3648 2018-11-20 19:51:52 Ah yes because if there were ever a symbol of state innovation the hyperloop funded by oil trillions would be it
3649 2018-11-20 19:51:48 My tossed salad needs more oil.
3650 2018-11-20 19:51:47 While Opec exists Saudi will have influence on oil prices.Putin would side with Iran over Saudi Arabia so don't try to argue he wouldn't.American lives and interests as a whole are more important than one murder. Iran murders people EVERY DAY day yet Obama gave him billions.
3651 2018-11-20 19:51:42 Principled and GOP are like oil and water.
3652 2018-11-20 19:51:40 Any way you cut it, it's blood on both their hands. Saudis for Khashoggi and Trump for allowing the genocide in Yemen to continue.  Trump funnels aid by arms shipments to Saudis in addition to the oil. Let's not forget those new Trump Towers he's contracting for around the world.
3653 2018-11-20 19:51:30 Mine just started driving also. He also put oil in the lawnmower gas tank. So ya, I’m a little worried. 
3654 2018-11-20 19:51:24 So, I bought a very expensive facial oil and it's caused my skin to break out. I made my own face mask with natural ingredients and it's soothed my skin. It's so nice and cooling.
3655 2018-11-20 19:51:24 Wasn’t Brennan somehow associated with the CIA. Paybacks for an old friend to write up some fake stuff.  They wrote up fake stuff so@Bush would go to war with Iraq. Why not do the same thing to destabilize the oil commodities.

3661 2018-11-20 19:50:52 Once again, it's all about oil.
3662 2018-11-20 19:50:50 KELLY JANE was Spot ON! She spoke of the US valuing life & holding people who would indiscriminately take life accountable. For what is the value of Human Life? For Trump, Khashoggi's value of life was about 23 Bucks/Bl of oil as he inexplicably continues to TANK OIL!!! @cvpayne

3670 2018-11-20 19:50:11 Not directly of course. But anti oil is straight up directly. Then he bought a 4.5 billion dollar nothing. Made an American company wealthy while laying off yet more Canadians. Yah, he’s a real winner.
3671 2018-11-20 19:50:02 We have the best allies. Cheap oil > ethics
3672 2018-11-20 19:50:00 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3673 2018-11-20 19:49:58 Rather than partying like it's 2003 perhaps the US should get rid of Bolton.

Then get a Special Envoy who is aware that Syria is in control of many of its own oil fields.

Which is why Jordanians are now travelling to Syria to buy cheap fuel.
3674 2018-11-20 19:49:45 But not the real challenges, 
Medicare 4 all
Climate change
Getting big money out of politics
Real Immigration reform
Not enough for food safety. Monsanto/Nestle/bayer
Dems vote to deregulate banks 
Women still make less then men.
Didn’t do enough about big oil
Big Pharma & etc.
3675 2018-11-20 19:49:42 I want to remove my tongue after this oregano oil shot I just took. Some things that are so good for you make you never want to open your mouth ever again. 
3676 2018-11-20 19:49:30 17:31:
NEW #US #SANCTIONS TARGET INTERNATIONAL NETWORK IN WHICH #IRAN ALONG WITH #RUSSIAN COMPANIES SENDS #OIL TO #SYRIA - OFFICIAL
3677 2018-11-20 19:49:25 Except hes shown no loyalty to Russia at all. And punishing the Saudis in any meaningful way means they will likely cut off oil exports, which would cause oil which has dropped over 40 dollars a barrel in 7 months to skyrocket that entire price back over night
3678 2018-11-20 19:49:21 We the people don't stand with Saudia Arabia. But when the leader in oil reserves in the world is using the Petro dollar and buying billions of dollars in weapons from your government..well they can kill whomever they choose..Yemenis, reporters, gays...kill all day 
3679 2018-11-20 19:49:18 delete oil companies
3680 2018-11-20 19:49:16 Lmao y’all should’ve saw me earlier putting oil In my car wit this skirt on and heels
3681 2018-11-20 19:49:14 Onions lettuce tomato oil vinegar and spices #JMSweepstakes
3682 2018-11-20 19:49:08 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
3683 2018-11-20 19:48:52 Well, remember the Saudis SUPPORT fundamentalist Muslim doctrine, even extremism...as long as it is in someone else's land...oh, reason to be "green" (energy wise) - would we all give a damn if we didn't use oil? No. We'd laugh at men in robes riding horses that have a hump.
3684 2018-11-20 19:48:47 hard to say, oil prices are plummeting, which is bad for oil companies and bad for the markets
3685 2018-11-20 19:48:39 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!
3686 2018-11-20 19:48:37 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always been the home of Wahhabism and aside from oil, which they barely even know to produce themselves, has not contributed anything positive to the world.  Nothing has changed.
3687 2018-11-20 19:48:25 Hahaha well exfoliation is important on any part of your body! Idk about the mask/if it did anything. And the oil is nice just for like, moisturizing lol. Booty beauty products 
3688 2018-11-20 19:48:19 Well if he did say it do something the dems would cry about the economy and oil prices. He can’t win either way.
3689 2018-11-20 19:48:05 The top Snake Oil Salesman ever born  . . .
3690 2018-11-20 19:48:03 Greens, Why aren’t you protesting Millions of barrels of Foreign Tanker Oil imported into Canada everyday.  No Yankees paying you to Protest that. 
How bout protesting Quebec dumping Billions of Gallons of Raw Sewage in the St Lawrence River. 
Greens are money grabbing bastards
3691 2018-11-20 19:48:02 As I said Wullie Forties Pipeline does not connect all facilities. Northern North Sea and West of Shetland are served by pipelines into Sullom Voe. Oil from floating production systems is generally transported to Sullom Voe and Hound Point by tanker
3692 2018-11-20 19:47:59 Translation: We talk about energy independence but don’t do anything about it and we’re really beholden to Saudi oil.
3693 2018-11-20 19:47:55 Pompeo is a liar; it's about Money/oil$$$$$
"Historically", several Saudis were among the 9/11 attacks that killed innocent Americans in Our Country.
3694 2018-11-20 19:47:46 can’t stand people havin a go at iceland (the shop) for their palm oil ads like “save the orangutans but fuck the turkeys n pigs right” fuck off, progress is progress n it’s so good, this is why people hate vegans   I s2g
3695 2018-11-20 19:47:42 Oil hit is Stealth QE
3696 2018-11-20 19:47:39 @realDonaldTrump With oil and gas making up 8 percent of US GDP a 50% cut in oil prices erases all the gains in the US economy you are so proud of.  By talking down the price of oil you are forcing the US economy into recession.
3697 2018-11-20 19:47:32 I sell perfume oil. You can patronise me too
3698 2018-11-20 19:47:29 Treating my car today, Oil change and alignment 
3699 2018-11-20 19:47:29 Do you have a page that lists NZ products that don’t use palm oil?
3700 2018-11-20 19:47:22 I recommend “Oil on Water” by @helonhabila ,you won’t regret 
3701 2018-11-20 19:47:18 New Worcester Oil fired combi with a 7 Year Worcester bosch warranty and Nest smart thermostat fitted today to replace old inefficient oil fired boiler that was leaking carbon monoxide
3702 2018-11-20 19:47:15 LOL when a bitch is a rude worker when I’m trying to get my oil changed. Like bitch don’t get sassy with me and change my gd oil.
3703 2018-11-20 19:47:14 North Sea oil is running out? Sue here hasn't read or watched the news since #IndyRef
3704 2018-11-20 19:47:05 about to get boba and get my oil changed, car washed, tires rotated and go to target wow adulthood
3705 2018-11-20 19:47:02 Pipelines. Oil for $10 a barrel is insane when we should be getting $50 plus. That's a revenue issue.
3706 2018-11-20 19:47:01 I spilled cooking oil on my fucking uggs. LIVID!!! 
3707 2018-11-20 19:47:00 Until the oil runs out 
3708 2018-11-20 19:47:00 Commodities update:
Gold: -0.32%
Silver: -0.92%
WTI crude: -6.63%
Brent oil: -6.30%
3709 2018-11-20 19:46:58 25% fall in oil price in 6 weeks and we get 3p off a litre. Nice.
3710 2018-11-20 19:46:57 I think you have just lost a massive chunk of your vegan customers with this choice @IcelandFoods it’s kind of a kick in the teeth since it was the most of vegan community who spread the word about your no palm oil. Vegans celebrate Christmas too 
3711 2018-11-20 19:46:50 Locked my key in my Truck right before I was supposed to get an oil change. I’m so stressed and pissed I might go buy a pack a cigs and light all them bitches up at once namsayn
3712 2018-11-20 19:46:49 Weed Companies haven't been known to donate to individual politicians, not completely unheard of, but not a menacing trend like Big Pharma, Big Oil, Prison and Military Industrialists and for sure big Alcohol and Tobacco. Please!
3713 2018-11-20 19:46:46 Today, the president of the United States said it's OK to murder a journalist in your embassy as long as you buy lots of weapons from us and keep oil cheap.
3714 2018-11-20 19:46:43 Tira pressão da inflação Norte Americana. Por isto está em queda, daí o Fed não precisará subir juros tão rápido o que poderia produzir cataclismos ao redor do mundo. Oil se estabilizará nos US$50 penso. Mais baixos estao o oil Usa  US$25 e Saudita US$10. Shale em US$40
3715 2018-11-20 19:46:43 Mike, you do know oil has other uses?

Burning it for energy is mad but the world needs plastic and lubrication.

Unlike you I'm a republican AND nationalist that welcomes the discovery of resources, but then I'm a pragmatist who views things in the round.

I suspect you aren't.
3716 2018-11-20 19:46:43 Saudi's main contributions to the world: Oil Embargos, Wahabi jihadist training schools, 9/11 hijackers, Osama bin Laden, war in Yemen, murdering journalists, oppressing women, mismanaging holy sites, feigning support for Israel. But they buy weapons and #Trump real estate.

#RUSSIA WILL CONTINUE SUPPLYING #SYRIA WITH #OIL DESPITE PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES - SENIOR RUSSIAN LAWMAKER
3718 2018-11-20 19:46:39 What happens if there's an oil fire
3719 2018-11-20 19:46:25 god i cant imagine how that's going to affect your area. let me know if there are any sites taking donations for any locals who need help. that oil just gets into everything.
3720 2018-11-20 19:46:18 They think they can throw money at everything. Was reading on All Arabiya in October where a government official threatened to reduce oil production and arms purchase from the Western world should MbS be sanctioned. Imagine !
3721 2018-11-20 19:46:04 What a fucking intellect. How about Saudi mass executions often by beheading? Inflating oil prices. 9/11. Murder of people who oppose them politically,  treatment of women.... The list is huge. The US  cannot overlook all the injustice and crimes just for a few dollars
3722 2018-11-20 19:46:03 メキシコでは無料ですが、インフルエンザの予防接種受けたことなしです。風邪にもかかったことなし。医者からも受けんでもええよ～、って言われています。反対に、少し風邪気味の人が、予防接種を受けたら、物凄い風邪ひきになります。
3723 2018-11-20 19:45:58 Just exfoliate afterwards then massage an oil blend into your skin afterwards...the best feeling EVER!
3724 2018-11-20 19:45:58 I do
3725 2018-11-20 19:45:58 Put some baby oil in the one you’ve got now
3726 2018-11-20 19:45:46 Once again the media will not expose big Oil !! Perhaps Trumps is right that the media is the enemy of the people why else would they not have coast to coast coverage on this??
3727 2018-11-20 19:45:45 Hate to say it but they’ve done more than Edmonton with less and play a great brand of hockey. Here’s hoping I can say the same soon about the Oil.
3728 2018-11-20 19:45:43 Why? Historically oil price never drops like this percentage countisouly
3729 2018-11-20 19:45:37 Clement Attlee carpet bombed Malaya with Agent Orange, sent warships to Iran when they nationalised their oil, oversaw the ethnic cleansing of 400,000 Palestinians, partitioned India resulting in millions of deaths & waged war on Korea with the US.
3730 2018-11-20 19:45:37 So what is your recommendation Genius?? Shall we take out a Crown Prince? Boycott Saudi oil? I'm awaiting your response.
3731 2018-11-20 19:45:21 The Magnitsky Act applies here! U.S. surrenders moral authority for an oil and blood soaked buck.
3732 2018-11-20 19:45:20 So great to have a president who FURTHER blurs the lines on whether murder, torture and dismemberment are really THAT BAD if there’s money to be made! EVIDENTLY IT’S FINE #capitalism #oil #greed #MAGA
3733 2018-11-20 19:45:14 Back from 2 days in the Cotswolds but wasn’t expecting this incredible rout in oil . My few longs in the sector luckily not a big size are  in percentage terms taking a big beating #brent #stocks #uk #markets
3734 2018-11-20 19:45:10 Blower motor, blower motor resistor plus brakes, oil change, tire rotation/balance... $1215

Extended Warranty covered $614 for blower motor and blower motor resistor. 

The remaining $601 is what I paid out of pocket for.

My apt heater got fixed as well for free! 
3735 2018-11-20 19:45:04 Agon oil, an shae butta makes beard stuff now n theres this company called beard Kaiser
3736 2018-11-20 19:45:04 $GSPE added more today! $400,000 buy at the bottom. Major support level here possibly confirmed. Tight hole should be getting and update real soon. #oil #gom subsalt ftw.
3737 2018-11-20 19:45:00 NO independencia do BC, NO cessão onerosa, Oil despencando, US despencando, nomeações "estranhas"....

Pode não ser perfeita, mas parece que vai ser forte.
3738 2018-11-20 19:44:59 Are oil companies like Exxon also "bought"? They ran their own studies on climate change - don't you think they would have a motive to find that it wasn't happening? They still found it was real.
3739 2018-11-20 19:44:54 OIL & $$$$
3740 2018-11-20 19:44:48 Well, the popcorn didn't go well so I am either going to bath in Crisco oil or shake and bake.
3741 2018-11-20 19:44:36 Was thinking more terrorist groups and anti oil think tanks, Soros, et al.
3742 2018-11-20 19:44:35 I just can't take this anymore I'm just going to lose my freaking mind. How many enemies does he stand beside and attack every American Institute. This is a traitor go get him. Don't forget our history with Saudi Arabia we don't need their friendship or their oil. He is a traitor
3743 2018-11-20 19:44:29 Think the funniest thing I've ever seen was a guy reverse at full pelt out of the back of a 40ft container with his heels dragging and ripped the forks clean off on the ramp lip  hydraulic oil everywhere
3744 2018-11-20 19:44:19 He definitely did not put America first with this. He once again sided with a tyrannical ruler over human decency. He promised independence from Saudi Arabian oil and now he claims they are necessary for the good of America. What an ignorant and arrogant man Trump is. So sad.
3745 2018-11-20 19:44:14 Logistics are everything in business. 

That's why oil prices are the only commodities that you ever see consistently tracked with standard forex.
3746 2018-11-20 19:44:14 Pompeo is a liar; it's about Money/oil$$$$$
"Historically", several Saudis were among the 9/11 attacks that killed innocent Americans in Our Country.
3747 2018-11-20 19:44:11 I show my gratitude for their selflessness, but these troops whom are children, fathers, mothers,sisters and etc are being made to fight for energy (OIL)and destabilizing  countries that we don’t need when we have renewable tech and we need to leave other countries alone.
3748 2018-11-20 19:44:09 Gaddafi wanted a gold backed currency. That could have threatened USD backed oil trading if it caught on in the region.
3749 2018-11-20 19:43:58 I would love to STEP INTO Winter in style, with a shopping spree to buy some BOOT-iful footwear  Some Coconut oil would be the icing on the cake! 
3750 2018-11-20 19:43:56 Been trading oil too? Rough.
3751 2018-11-20 19:43:45 I think you mean pouring oil all over the coast
3752 2018-11-20 19:43:45 Has it ever crossed your mind that "God" promised somebody's land to the children of Israel??? 

Why couldn't "he" promise them an empty, uninhabited, unoccupied land which were plentiful. He couldn't even promise them any part of Africa with diamonds and oil that was free.
3753 2018-11-20 19:43:40 @americanpickers are on the way there right now.
3754 2018-11-20 19:43:40 My hair looked so good this morning when I took it out of its coconut oil hair mask bun it was all curly of course right before I had to shower 
3755 2018-11-20 19:43:26 Since 1/2009, Oil has been down over 6% 26 times, the next day it's been up 15 times for an average gain of 1.12%.  The biggest next day gain was 10.09% in January 2016.
3756 2018-11-20 19:43:13 No Wall Street is hurting if we do anything Saudis would flood the thw world oil causing a major sell off. Hurting whats left of Trumps gains which isnt much now.
3757 2018-11-20 19:43:06 Damn, you were doing so good on the palm oil front, shame you had to go ruin all that by promoting “products” that contribute to the leading cause of deforestation and global warming 
3758 2018-11-20 19:43:04 i came with my sister to change her oil and if the cute guy isn’t here i WILL cry 
3759 2018-11-20 19:43:01 This is so not okay I think I'm going to fly out of my chair how many deviance around the world is he going to try to protect while his citizens die fade cry. This is about money and oil and you better not think otherwise ever. He knows when the Secret Service is gone so is he
3760 2018-11-20 19:42:54 Why is Canada selling weapons to such a corrupt country ? Why are we buying thie oil ?
3761 2018-11-20 19:42:48 Saudis provide the US with oil and buy weaponry from them. Hence why the cowards won't rock the boat. You have entirely missed the point though. If any of those Presidents had a statement like Trump the US Right would be rabid and frothing at the mouth about how they are traitors
3762 2018-11-20 19:42:38 I was going to say man, always worth checking what palm oil. I was reading the other day that some companies have switched away from palm oil because of the bad PR but are using alternative oils that are even worse.
3763 2018-11-20 19:42:38 Crude oil at 53.43, down 6.6% and lowest since October 2017
3764 2018-11-20 19:42:32 Whats a reliable brand 4 oil cartridges @pinksostuckup u seem to kno a lot
3765 2018-11-20 19:42:31 Because United helping Saudi Arabia develop their football industry is the same as City becoming relevant because of oil money  typical ex Chelsea fan you
3766 2018-11-20 19:42:24 How can we boycott Saudi Arabia? Do they export anything other than oil?
3767 2018-11-20 19:42:21 U.S. oil prices drop nearly 7% to settle at lowest in more than a year

3770 2018-11-20 19:42:19 I can advise you that we've developed our labelling system to include sustainable palm oil and that 98% of our products contain sustainable palm oil. We're also working on increasing this amount. Brandon
3771 2018-11-20 19:42:15 Oh not at all. The most costly thing on my car so far will be tires. Brakes were a little over $500 all around. Oil change is $37 every 5000 miles. Cost of ownership is the cheapest ever next to the Acura TL.

3779 2018-11-20 19:41:29 @CookIslandsGov seriously need to stop all discussions regarding seabed mining. No matter what anyone tells you, digging a hole anywhere to extract minerals, oil and gas is simply a terrible idea. There is no reset button once your environment is affected. #NoSeabedMining
3780 2018-11-20 19:41:22 Yup, so depressing. Money and oil.

3784 2018-11-20 19:41:04 They are. No chemicals put into the air, and I love looking up different oil combinations
3785 2018-11-20 19:41:00 While they are sitting on the vast oil reserve they have
3786 2018-11-20 19:40:59 Sauté any leafy greens (spinach, kale, chard) in olive oil w/garlic til wilted, remove from pan and set aside. In same pan saute 2 strips of bacon (cut in small bits) til crispy. Add bacon & greens to 4 cups chicken broth with a tin of cannelini beans and 1 cup cooked orzo. 
3787 2018-11-20 19:40:55 They cut people's heads off in the street. Like most of the Middle East, nobody in their right mind would have anything to do with them if they didn't have all that oil.... and money.
3788 2018-11-20 19:40:45 I hve that in a fragrance oil. For my bath and body business i can make bath bombs in that scent too
3789 2018-11-20 19:40:44 Biotin supplements and biotin shampoo and conditioner. Also don’t brush your hair just comb it. Oh and coconut oil helps it stay healthy as it gets longer
3790 2018-11-20 19:40:44 Water and 1000mg of vitamin D. And fish oil. No joke
3791 2018-11-20 19:40:44 Oils and butters are better for us, but in either case the key is still deep penetration, and then protection. Hydration attacks the problem from within, moisturization from without, but a sealant layer helps by giving the lotion/oil time to seep in.
3792 2018-11-20 19:40:42 The same people bitching on this tweet will be the same people bitching when our oil increases ten-fold due to a fall out with Saudi Arabia. Until, we can get a new source of oil we are stuck with Saudi Arabia. Y’all were silent when Obama sang praise to King Abdullah!

3796 2018-11-20 19:40:26 PDP borrowed $500m to start the Kaduna-Abuja rail system when oil was as high as $140pb.

3797 2018-11-20 19:40:21 Please someone interview Poloz today and ask him:
1- IS  OIL still  ''Clearly that is subtracting something from growth" ?
2- Still believe that our economy is ''overheating and creating inflation''?
3- How is the global economy recovery going?

3802 2018-11-20 19:40:00 update on week: it’s only a tuesday & my head almost got smashed in while changing my oil, my hood fell down & thankfully i was bending down getting oil. 2nd, TMCC are stupid fucks and i’m trying to get the copy of my cpr card so i have it for my cna classes in jan. LUV LIFE :)))
3803 2018-11-20 19:40:00 Attacking a bankrupt business, getting a judgement for a few hundred $ each, that may never get paid is an odd definition of a huge victory.
3804 2018-11-20 19:39:58 12.1b, i've posted the link to ZE Ready standards. I think the competition and markets authority would have issues with Renault dictating that one company must be installed. That is similar to they recommend a certain brand of oil but you can use any brand as long as right type
3805 2018-11-20 19:39:54 Agree.  Producers already turning conservative as '19 oil price assumptions and spend are coming down (our scuttlebutt).  WTI also doesn't acct for differentials.  Bakken at effectively $50 = no growth and WCS telling Canada to close down.  Sentiment now impacting fundamentals.
3806 2018-11-20 19:39:47 Re: 45s statement on #SaudiArabia #MbS & #KashoggiMurder 
1) Disgusting to have an economy based on weapons production
2) His own CIA says MbS knew/approved
3) It's always about oil
4) He sides with KSA b/c he wants war with Iran
5) Congress will do nothing
3807 2018-11-20 19:39:45 Oil down 6.6% to $53+. Look like I can buy gas again.
3808 2018-11-20 19:39:44 Oil...
3809 2018-11-20 19:39:41 Oil reserves killing the planet and making people billionaires 
3810 2018-11-20 19:39:40 Why the usa still fucking with Saudi? Probs oil...yas know how much we need our low gas prices...plus you seen their wealth?? Rich get away with corruption allllllll the time
3811 2018-11-20 19:39:37 Crude Oil -7%! That's a strong move to the downside.
3812 2018-11-20 19:39:33 Studies have shown that coconut oil can help improve the moisture content of the skin and it can help reduce the symptoms of eczema. It has also been known to help protect the hair from damage by acting as a weak sunscreen and blocking about 20% of the sun’s ultraviolet rays.
3813 2018-11-20 19:39:33 So today while giving a speech about essential oils, I got asked if they were used for the B.P oil spill. On that note, have a Happy Thanksgiving!
3814 2018-11-20 19:39:31 Oil markets (2trillion $ per annum) are USD traded and key for American fiat money hegemony. Stakes are so high that Trump basically ignores the Saudi MBS ordered massacre.
3815 2018-11-20 19:39:29 This is frightening we are in a lose lose position if we go after Saudi Arabia for the murder of the journalists. What the answer is I don’t know. But a war in the Middle East between all of these countries we’re talking world war three. And it’s oil, and religion
3816 2018-11-20 19:39:27 My uncle just slowed me down like af .... i have stuff to do and he wants to take my car to get an oil change ! But I’m thankful tho
3817 2018-11-20 19:39:25 2/ Chicago has in many respects stricter gun control laws than Canada.
If you take out Chicago/ Detroit and L.A from the crime stats it’s numbers via population falls to EU levels.
Oil spill ..maybe we should not slowdown the upgrading(if not replacement)of energy infrastructure.

3819 2018-11-20 19:39:20 Long before the #Khashoggi murder and as signalled today in Trump's statement, His administration had issues with OPEC and even openly called out the King of KSA for Ripping off MUCH from USA. Now is the pay time for Trump. He shall suck those oil wells to dry my Browda...DRY
3820 2018-11-20 19:39:17 This is the #painful aspect of reality.  

The science and technology industries #couldnotexist without the resource of #crudeoil.

Saudi Arabia owns the #largestglobalsupply of crude oil.

Ergo: Saudi Arabia has #TheWholeWorld by the short and curlies.

3823 2018-11-20 19:39:08 First time getting my oil changed since January. How do I even own a car ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3824 2018-11-20 19:39:02 I only meal prep for my mutt, mmmmkkkk!! What kind of mother would I be if I didn't let her pick the bowl?? Chicken, pumpkin seeds, coconut oil, and tumeric!!!  #ketodog #mct #highfatdiet #Druzy
3825 2018-11-20 19:39:01 @GTFishandChips Hi me again! Can you tell me if the Palm Oil you use to fry your food in is sustainable? And what brand you use please? #palmoil #deforestation #savetheorangutan #IcelandAdvert
3826 2018-11-20 19:38:58 Jim.  With oil being low $.  Does that mean buy Airlines and Cruise companies?  Profits should be up right?
3827 2018-11-20 19:38:57 And yet Chretien took $52B from the E.I. fund, $28B from public sector pension fund, and cut $ 25B in healthcare transfers to the provinces. For a grand total of $105B. What were you saying again about oil being above $100 during Harpers majority. Oh ya, you still got it wrong
3828 2018-11-20 19:38:55 We will be just fine. The oil will find it's way to the market. People are waking up to the insanity, and what caused it.
3829 2018-11-20 19:38:50 @PowerLunch #oil #oilandgas investors #MustSeeTV @KilduffReport interview on now.
3830 2018-11-20 19:38:47 Bought 5k $OILD 3x oil bear, oil slide ain’t over until $50 test
3831 2018-11-20 19:38:46 $XLE - Oil prices slammed again, falling -$3.77 or 6.6% to settle at $53.43 per barrel, the lowest levels since October 2017
3832 2018-11-20 19:38:30 I'm thinking about seeing my cats again and now I'm tearing up in an Roadrunner while I get my oil changed someone help lol
3833 2018-11-20 19:38:30 And the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it also
3834 2018-11-20 19:38:28 Exactly. Truth is we’ve been turning a blind eye to KSA atrocities for decades. Not gonna change under Trump. 

KSA oil will run out on about 15-20 yrs. it’s always been the goal to take control of the worlds 3th largest oil reserves in Iran.

3837 2018-11-20 19:38:25 Excellent, my oil needs changing and tires rotated and balanced 
How soon can I get an appointment? 
Thanks bunches
3838 2018-11-20 19:38:23 *expansion/increasing production. Producing itself is a more efficient land use on a oil/ha basis than other oilseeds, and we do need to know way more about substitution elasticities to better gauge what will happen in the future. Not straightforward given the policy mess ATM
3839 2018-11-20 19:38:21 Thoughts about your use of palm oil @Oreo ?  Will you consider stopping using the suppliers of it to help stop the deforestation?
3840 2018-11-20 19:38:19 Wow never thought I'd have to go pay someone to change my oil, always thought my dad would be the one to take care of it 
3841 2018-11-20 19:38:17 Did you use gas and oil to get there???
3842 2018-11-20 19:38:15 Dur dur dur it's cold so no climate change dur dur globalist neoliberal conspiracy dur dur dur oil barons are my friends.

3844 2018-11-20 19:38:13 well we could always tell them we have oil so we become part of the US xD
3845 2018-11-20 19:38:07 The American people have enjoyed their way of life because of the petrodollar. If the American Dollar loses the reserve currency status America will fall and fall hard. One of the only reason that America has that status is that the Saudis trade oil exclusively in the dollar.

3847 2018-11-20 19:37:49 National security for these guys is buying oil and selling tanks. All other considerations they probably think are too vague.

3851 2018-11-20 19:37:21 I'm in such a good mood right now, and I don't know if it's because I've just started taking hemp oil or because I just had a breakup that needed to happen or both. 

But hey, good moods have been hard to come by so I'll take it.

3854 2018-11-20 19:37:17 Hit on oil has been orchestrated by the collusive Fed/Treasury/BIS Goon squad. Why have they taken down oil? To provide the economy with Stealth QE & save face on lies about economic strength. In other words cheap oil is the sunglasses on Bernie in "Weekend At Bernie's" economy.
3855 2018-11-20 19:37:16 The project was predicated on converting part of the under-utilized TCPL natgas mainline to oil transport, but the economics changed when a new gas pricing agreement between TCPL and producers changed the outlook for natgas transport.
3856 2018-11-20 19:37:11 Saudi Arabia is our ally for one reason.... let me spell it out OIL
3857 2018-11-20 19:37:03 Not after @realDonaldTrump's suckling at Saudi Arabia's oil teet today...
3858 2018-11-20 19:37:01 Duncan Mighty rhymed oil spillage with Freedom College, yam porridge and Tiwa Savage. I don’t want to hear pim about Cole vs Kendrick when clearly the best wordsmith is Uncle Duncan. Kmt
3859 2018-11-20 19:37:00 Or Saudi Arabia has the OIL !! you people are really this dumb. Smh it’s almost comical. But deeply sad
3860 2018-11-20 19:36:50 I thought my oil change light was on but it was actually my tire pressure so I just wasted $70 on getting my oil changed  I guess it costs to be a f*g
3861 2018-11-20 19:36:50 The Bushes protected their ass and now Trump kisses their ass. the Saudi is a dictatorship. No freedom of press, freedom of thought , freedom of religion. We need their oil and their evils are over-looked. So much for THRUTH
3862 2018-11-20 19:36:46 True but again the system.  It's entrenched,  Hitch may do more good for the OIL on the short more than most may believe.  Sure, he's very old school but that may play well enough for the Oil to get into the playoffs. We have to make the playoffs, if not, Pistol Pete is gone!
3863 2018-11-20 19:36:42 Excellent — Beard Oil/Balm would complete that look.
3864 2018-11-20 19:36:35 Finally getting an oil change. I’m only 6,000 miles over. That’s not too bad right?
3865 2018-11-20 19:36:35 Yea that was the dumb yep that was the dumb Republicans and President Bush of the Bush oil family, buddies with the Saudi King,  really screwing up the United States with that stupid decision. But money, you know?

3870 2018-11-20 19:36:14 They sanctioned 17 people. I’m curious what else you would like? U want to cut off diplomacy with the worlds leading oil producer over one person? Let me know how that works out for ya.
3871 2018-11-20 19:36:11 CP:  Please discuss the oil drop today, and what you expect in the near future.  Right now, it seems DXY is stalling... is it possible we have our low (temporarily?) in oil today?
3872 2018-11-20 19:36:07 @MelissaAFrancis With oil and gas making up 8 percent of US GDP a 50% cut in oil prices erases all the gains in the US economy our president is so proud of.  By talking down the price of oil Trump is forcing the US economy into recession.
3873 2018-11-20 19:36:04 Oh so oil and $430 Billion is worth all the millions of Yemeni lives? Then Iran's oil should be worth the sanctions being lifted, since Saudis planned and executed 9/11 attacks, how many terror acts have Iranians carried out vs Saudis?
3874 2018-11-20 19:35:50 Yeah, I am sure Trumps is solely became president because of his business interests. That is such an asinine statement. Think about it. The more likely reason the price of oil
3875 2018-11-20 19:35:50 The amount of times I do oil changes and change my brakes is ridiculous
3876 2018-11-20 19:35:45 Do you think Trump knows the difference between crude oil and heating oil?
3877 2018-11-20 19:35:44 Bad in Venezuela too. Least they got oil ‘reserves’ ;)
3878 2018-11-20 19:35:36 OK  most of us too..  I do hope Trump realize when it comes to to crude oil , Trump is nuts

3881 2018-11-20 19:35:13 I don’t see any scientific studies linked in that article. I’d be happy to see scientific studies showing the negative health effects of normal use of vegetable oils. Saying “it’s like motor oil” is meaningless. Lots of things are “like” poisons but are fine to eat.
3882 2018-11-20 19:35:06 It was mostly Saudis that flew into the WTC on 9/11 so I don’t buy into the ally BS. They have oil. That’s what this is all about.
3883 2018-11-20 19:35:02 covered oil on closing
3884 2018-11-20 19:35:01 Well hell, if there is oil and guns involved whata ya gunna do.
3885 2018-11-20 19:35:01 I don't agree with this at all. The US imposed sanctions and drove down oil prices, all in an effort to make Maduras submit to the Rothschild petrodollar slavery. Meanwhile annually sending $500,000 annually to the Columbian cocaine capital of the world to steal from Venezuela.
3886 2018-11-20 19:34:59 Oh and of course we don’t want to stop the flow of that precious oil into the US.

3890 2018-11-20 19:34:43 Oil price around $50 is good for Global shipping companies and is good for Global Economy. Oil Demand will increase and Rate will increase. So, I'm think that 2019 is the year for Global shipping Industry.
3891 2018-11-20 19:34:41 Eucalyptus oil can get it off! Or powdered laundry detergent or windex, then scrub vigorously with a paper towel. Or if you have a plastic shopping bag rub that on the silicone, that can take it off. My little brother gets it all over his hands all the time!
3892 2018-11-20 19:34:41 He needed the oil in the region.

One reason, among many, why Germany did not assemble a large strategic bomber force like the RAF did was that Germany simply did not have enough oil.

While the US & UK had motorised armies, Germany relied heavily on horses right to the end.
3893 2018-11-20 19:34:39 She’s not familiar with math.
3894 2018-11-20 19:34:37 The methodology is crap, we all know it is, your desperate need to cling to such poor data says it all. Go to HMRC and check out regional data, over £30 billion from the North Sea oil attributed to 5th region because it goes direct from Oil rig to customer
3895 2018-11-20 19:34:37 Guess American's will have to make a decision - We have the necessary oil reserves in North America to tell the Saudis to go to hell.  It comes down to human rights vs. oil.  Assassination by govt's ruler went out the door in the 70s. don't give Trump a gun - he might use it.

3904 2018-11-20 19:34:04 Yet, when you  followers of scientism ignore anything, included any peer-reviewed studies and reproducible observations that contradict you're dogma.    One of the most frequent rebuttals I've seen is that those Scientists must be on the Oil Companies payroll.
3905 2018-11-20 19:34:03 Without the pipelines to feed our economy there are no funds available to develop and diversify our economy.  Yes, we need to move towards ecologically friendly economy, but our oil is the key.

3910 2018-11-20 19:33:47 Lol, go easy on him
3911 2018-11-20 19:33:46  what did you get? I cant wait for you to try the cleansing oil. Maybe you'll like it as much as I do
3912 2018-11-20 19:33:43 I agree. Sadly for us and the rest of the world the US being the leading oil and NG producer means the rich and powerful want a middle east war.
3913 2018-11-20 19:33:38 u know, at least trump is being honest. he out right stating, "the saudis do horrible things but we won't do anything about it bc oil and $$$"

3919 2018-11-20 19:33:26 Well Mr PM.  I work in the Canadian oil sector.   What are you doing, that will get Canadian oil world pricing?   Seems like a lot of middle class families rely on the oil business.
3920 2018-11-20 19:33:24 Oh yes, the initial investment paid off. And in this last bit there was even the sesame oil that was part of the recipe (bought today).
3921 2018-11-20 19:33:18 at the risk of introducing heresy into your TLs: we are talking like coconut oil (or other body oils for you richer ppl), right?

B/c regular lotion is half the problem. Many of us dutifully lotioned growing up, only to be betrayed by 11am. (A.M.!)
3922 2018-11-20 19:33:17 Remember Saudi Arabia was also birth country of Osama. Also only country allowed to fly out of US Airspace after September 11. Responsible for 70's oil embargo. Not our friends.
3923 2018-11-20 19:33:13 LOL keep selling that snake oil!
3924 2018-11-20 19:33:11 Ah but which oil is best....?
3925 2018-11-20 19:33:10 You can produce a barrel of oil sands oil using SAGD for $11.50. That is quite competitive with other producers. That mythical $3 sweet crude everybody talks about is rare, and getting rarer. And at $200 by 2023, that leaves a lot of profits to be had.

3928 2018-11-20 19:32:59 We did this under Bush after 9/11 hijackers. It isn’t new, but it is grotesque. Look at the way women are treated in Saudi. Why has that never been a human rights problem? Oil. Trump/GOP is the enabler today, but until we kick the habit, this type of situation won’t go away.

3930 2018-11-20 19:32:45 Can we tax dictator oil, and not dictator everything in the dollar store?
3931 2018-11-20 19:32:41 Also my favorite! I have been trying to get people to switch to oil foreverrrrr! I cringe when I see people do skincare videos and they're trying to remove mascara/liner and they tug and those beautiful eyes!

I thought you were pro-life? #gopLIES
3934 2018-11-20 19:32:26 It’s crap. If people want green beans, roast them in an oven with olive oil, salt and pepper. Takes 10 minutes and tastes great
3935 2018-11-20 19:32:05 he took what was one of the denses areas of archaeological sites in north America and unprotected it with the intent of allowing oil companies to destroy it
3936 2018-11-20 19:31:58 Oil they ur head ouch
3937 2018-11-20 19:31:52 oil is money and money is power
3938 2018-11-20 19:31:49 Chem trail conspiracy theories were BS. (Real problem is use of cheap Jet fuel oil). But use of sound as a weapon is a proven technology.
3939 2018-11-20 19:31:39 This from the parasites, US and Isreal who are currently illegally occupying Syrian land stealing oil.....
3940 2018-11-20 19:31:36 say they’re going to start winding down oil production in recognition of the urgency of climate change
3941 2018-11-20 19:31:30 Peppermint and Aloe shampoo by Design Essentials. Typically follow it up with or mix it the 2nd shampoo with a super moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. It’s the only one not harsh on my scalp because I get a lot of buildup and quick. I also oil it like every other day.
3942 2018-11-20 19:31:28 focus on renewable energy sources and someday you can tell Saudi Arabia and every other corrupt oil producer to fuck off for eternity
3943 2018-11-20 19:31:17 @jamieoliver please Jamie can you cover issue of Palm oil in catering as contributing to loss of biodiverse habitats
3944 2018-11-20 19:31:15 For everyone who keeps asking, I don't think there's much difference in the CV risk reducing properties of eicosapentaenoic vs. docohexaenoic acids. Both omega-3 fatty acids have shown benefits in various trials, so just eat fish instead of taking one specific oil.

There. Geez.
3945 2018-11-20 19:31:12 That's because of decades of Tory neo liberal economics, not the EU. EG, one of Thatcher's first acts was to abolish the North Sea oil levy that was set up to create a sovereign wealth fund. & they've always taken short term decisions for a quick buck rather than invest for all.
3946 2018-11-20 19:31:08 You look at his transactions on paper since his term...it’s ridiculous. You’d swear it was sabotage. I’m sick and tired of these clueless oil fans defending Lucic’s presence here too. His success reflects chiarelli’s. This franchise seems to try so hard to be horrible.

3949 2018-11-20 19:30:55 Support Obama, insult him, raise oil prices, you want me to keep going?

Just not “murder people Trump doesn’t care about”

3956 2018-11-20 19:30:35 what has the most bad consequences ?  that fence fake news or the fake Iran sanctions?  I think the fake Iran sanctions are much more troublesome. Why those fake sanctions? I mean Iran is laughing and selling as much oil as before. And for cash money now.

3960 2018-11-20 19:30:23 So @realDonaldTrump Oil is more important than the state-sanctioned murder of a journalist who was a U.S. resident?
The Saudis are not allies; they are co-conspirators with you.

3970 2018-11-20 19:29:55 If true that the US has become oil independent, and the WTI crude is around $50.00 a barrel, or around $1.20 /gal, why are gasoline prices of Regular at $3.00 / gal. Are the US oil companies selling our oil in the world market, instead of lowering our gasoline prices at home?
3971 2018-11-20 19:29:52 It was so difficult trying to find chocolate without palm oil in 
3972 2018-11-20 19:29:50 Legal fees?
3973 2018-11-20 19:29:48 That's bullshit. Pure and utter BULLSHIT. 

Saudi Arabia would keep it's oil prices competitive either way. This is simply to protect whatever inside deal Trump and Kushner hope to get from MBS. This is about their personal profit and NOTHING MORE.
3974 2018-11-20 19:29:47 Could have been a rich snake oil salesmen. But he knows what fear, anger, hate and grievance do, and uses them over and over. Yet it's just a show for him. He doesn't have any real love for anyone. He says you love me. How often do you he loves you? He's loves the applause
3975 2018-11-20 19:29:44 @GreggAWallace please Greg cover issue of Palm Oil in catering as is having profound effect on biodiverse habitats.
3976 2018-11-20 19:29:43 They can swing the global oil prices up or down with production cuts or boosts, they probably would make heavy cuts and send oil prices skyrocketing. High prices would not be ideal for most Americans (good for me) so he’s hesistant to react. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the US
3977 2018-11-20 19:29:42 Better yet - what happens to the world economy if oil prices are not regulated?  What happens should the cost of oil go to 200 dollars a barrel? or 20 dollars a barrel?  How many people suffer, die or become Americans become empoverished - I will wait "OH Wise One".
3978 2018-11-20 19:29:40 Oil prices falling from $86 to $62 (Brent) not only increases pressure for OPEC+ to cut, but gives them more leeway to do so (Trump).  Still think any cut overtightens market as inventories in 2018 were flat, but now Iranian exports -1M bpd even before OPEC+ cut. #OOTT
3979 2018-11-20 19:29:38 I've got enough oil with the AmRoys I own.

3984 2018-11-20 19:28:58 I wouldn’t usually use an oil on my face but it’s great and doesn’t make the skin greasy, also great for beards too!
3985 2018-11-20 19:28:51 Once the refinery is completed and running they can buy some of Alberta’s oil which will create competition for others, raising the price of Canadian oil.

3987 2018-11-20 19:28:43 I never knew we had anything to do with Saudi Arabia, until my roommate mentioned it a few days ago. He was telling me we get a lot of oil from them, which surprised me.
3988 2018-11-20 19:28:43 Do we get a bounce here when oil closes?

3992 2018-11-20 19:28:33 I was about to ask why @realDonaldTrump does not express solidarity with #ItaiDzamara's Zimbabwe as he did with #Khashoggi's Saudi Arabia. Then it hit me: Zimbabwe has no oil! Beam me up, Scotty!
3993 2018-11-20 19:28:32 These ones will just be in the gym lifting metals up and down, making irritating noise, sweating and farting unashamedly. I don't know who they're preparing to go and strangle, see veins like oil pipeline..
3994 2018-11-20 19:28:32 Today the President of the United States sanctioned blood for oil money, and showed the world that a journalists life was not worth risking upsetting oil trade. Truly disgusting.

Me *rubbing in the last bit of lavender* do you know any?
3996 2018-11-20 19:28:17 Thank you for replying about my concern for the mineral oil in your product. I never used to have an issue w/my fav volumizing (pink bottle) & now I’m noticing breakouts along hairline and neck possibly from conditioner. Is this a newer addition? Or just in perfect4platinum line?

4001 2018-11-20 19:28:02 Thank you. We recognize a few of these names. Without going into specifics, some of these even supply products from Europe, in the same clandestine manner as crude oil from Iran. According to Treasury (until today), imports were not under sanctions, but exports out of Syria were.

4007 2018-11-20 19:27:37 Why is it that you must use palm oil in your products? Surely historically, chocolatiers didn’t use palm oil from the other side of the world?
4008 2018-11-20 19:27:34 Thanks. I’d like it clearly labelled and particularly on products where you and your suppliers aren’t able to say if the palm oil is ‘sustainable’.

4011 2018-11-20 19:27:28 Dean Heller could probably due with a 7 figure big oil consultancy gig retirement plan so don't count on any Republicans doing the right thing
4012 2018-11-20 19:27:19 Racists, home wreckers, paedophile coach’s, youth team players being shot by first teamers and the owner being a murderous oil Barron. Apart from that.
4013 2018-11-20 19:27:18 I guess you know very well that POTUS cares more about keeping oil price as low as possible so our economy does not get a hit since imposing sanctions would ultimately lead to retaliations!
If you still find this laughable then pls explain why!
4014 2018-11-20 19:27:17 I’m constantly thinking about oil

4017 2018-11-20 19:27:03 Declassify the lie created by the CIA to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and the USA and crash the economy with the imploding oil price hike?  #CorruptIntelligenceAssholes
4018 2018-11-20 19:26:59 Hmm...it took 17 Saudis to murder and dismember one man. It took 15 to kill 3,000 Americans on 9.11. Looks like their efficiency is slipping. Trump "we stand with Saudi Arabia" = stand with oil and now...condo sales and personal bail out loans.
4019 2018-11-20 19:26:59 #oott:  Last week there was an API gain in supply of 8.2mb and 10.2 reported by EIA and oil rallied.  API reported today that demand for Petro was up over 3% in October.  Doesn't look like a demand shortage.
4020 2018-11-20 19:26:58 Them oil fields ain’t done with me yet 
4021 2018-11-20 19:26:55 Nonsense! I look out my window to English Bay, where these tankers being loaded at Westridge will pass by. I live in North America’s 3rd most densely populated citiy, no mix for oil tankers loaded down with 650 000 barrels of bitumen and no where near the US where you’re looking!
4022 2018-11-20 19:26:55 No downside, Coach Todd had a better chance than any Oil Coach since Ron Low. I think Hitch could make some great improvements to some of the individual performance of several players. Looking forward to the next 6 games, tell ya what. They won’t be worse.
4023 2018-11-20 19:26:52 Oil is more important than human lives according to trump. This is sickening.
4024 2018-11-20 19:26:45 Dude that’s next I hope. Chia makes me mad and I’m not even an oil fan
4025 2018-11-20 19:26:42 Matchmakers contain Palm oil because @Nestle use Palm oil. Gutted but @AldiUK mint sticks do not contain Palm oil and they're cheaper too life's got better 
4026 2018-11-20 19:26:42 Now I know I needa put oil in my car because these days have been tragic

4029 2018-11-20 19:26:30 I know the world runs on oil but the American/Saudi relationship is insane
4030 2018-11-20 19:26:27 During the reign of the Shah of Iran—whom we installed after overthrowing a secular, democratically elected president who nationalized oil—we turned a blind eye on his regime of torture, repression, and plunder, because: it’s a “dangerous world.” Didn’t end well.

4033 2018-11-20 19:26:20 Sorry Captain America, but the US gets most (roughly 40%) of its oil from Canada, the moron in chief actually choosing to do something, would have little effect on our gas prices. It's all about gun sales. That's what it all boils down to 
4034 2018-11-20 19:26:14 TDLR the Saudi’s [probably] whacked a journalist that was uncovering some [probably] incriminating things about their administration and Trump doesn’t want to slap sanctions on them for it because there would be negative economical impacts on America, think oil
4035 2018-11-20 19:25:58 Think I remember CME at 28x but could be misquoting.  More important IMO is paper cannot separate fr phys for very long in oil.  It can in gold

4038 2018-11-20 19:25:30 No palm oil! But let’s slaughter millions of animals! 
4039 2018-11-20 19:25:28 It's vital to preserving regional INstability and keeping the price of oil in the range where US energy companies maximize profit.  That's IT for our so-called national security interest in Saudi Arabia.  Pompeo isn't fooling anybody here.  #impeach45
4040 2018-11-20 19:25:25 How long we before we all have electric cars and don't have to depend on Middle East oil? Kill critics ... ok  Kill civilians ... ok Buy oil ... ok
4041 2018-11-20 19:25:22 Really?  Then why no protesting ever on the east coast to ban Saudi oil? Raw sewage discharged into the St Laurence?  
Your comment holds no weight.
4042 2018-11-20 19:25:20 HAHA  - OK - enlighten me - what happens to the USA dollar when the world stops paying for oil in USA dollars?  I will wait for your brilliance.
4043 2018-11-20 19:25:19 It's about oil and guns. Just like the past administrations. Bush family has strong ties to the saudis over oil hence why we didn't give a fuck when Saudis crashed into 9/11.  Saudis did 9/11.  Meanwhile there is a nonstop oil spill in the gulf of Mexico for the last 14 years
4044 2018-11-20 19:25:19 "After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels." -DJT
4045 2018-11-20 19:25:12 The power of Synthol oil..
4046 2018-11-20 19:24:52 As a woman if you don’t change your boob oil every 3000 touches you can get really sick
4047 2018-11-20 19:24:51 The sooner renewable and clean energy comes online to power the global economy, the better. It is sickening that the West has to keep these cunts sweet just for oil politics.
4048 2018-11-20 19:24:44 It would be hard to believe the US would shrug away a murder over oil prices if the US didn't shrug away murders and deaths all the time over oil prices.
4049 2018-11-20 19:24:43 ya but oil
4050 2018-11-20 19:24:39 I’ve been taking my daily dose of oregano oil and I haven’t shown any symptoms of sickness since that bad cold I had last month.  
4051 2018-11-20 19:24:38 #cdnecon Fall in crude oil finally catching up with USD/CAD ...trades over 1.33
4052 2018-11-20 19:24:37 So if the Saudis know they can get away with anything now after Trump and Pompeo statements, what motivation is there to appease the U.S. with increased production? I’d argue there isn’t any. #saudi #oil
4053 2018-11-20 19:24:31 If Iran would quit their crap with Israel then you would probably see more support for them and people turning on Saudi Arabia. Both countries have cheap oil but US is choosing the devil we know apparently.
4054 2018-11-20 19:24:28 styling? dunno mate. but if you want rly nice soft hair use some argan oil.
4055 2018-11-20 19:24:26 Albertans need to remember that there's more to our economy than oil and gas. We have agriculture, tech companies, and so much more. Diversify & political parties like #UCP won't be able to fear monger. #ableg #yeg #yyc
4056 2018-11-20 19:24:25 thankyou, interesting - conclusions not news to me but I wasn't specifically aware of the report itself. So given that oil in North Sea has peaked and probably only has another decade or two to run out, what would be IndyScot's income source afterwards & where does EU come in?
4057 2018-11-20 19:24:24 I'm a supporter, I lived through the70s, I remember it being about oil mainly, I also remember Tories in government in the 70s and there being no fuel, people queuing all night
4058 2018-11-20 19:24:10 I wish I wasn't garbage at painting this oil painting class makes me never want to look at paint even at a store.

4060 2018-11-20 19:24:06 We’ve only an oil cooled arc welder plus a pocket size inverter, never ceases to amaze me how versatile they are.
4061 2018-11-20 19:24:05 It all about $ and oil.  @SecPompeo if this was a white journalist, a right leaning journalist would it be a different outcome? If this had happened in a country that provides us little to nothing would the outcome be different? What exactly is your red line in terms of torture?
4062 2018-11-20 19:23:58 What’s a good beard oil brand?
4063 2018-11-20 19:23:55 Wayment...he does not like Muslims. This is more than relying on Saudi Arabia for oil. They have something on him and said "bitch, please - I dare you to come for us..." 
4064 2018-11-20 19:23:53 #OOTT Buying every barrel of oil I can. My guess is this correction is too much.
4065 2018-11-20 19:23:50 So #Saudi_Arabia #Saudis can  commit #YemenGenocide kidnap and disappear critics, torture and kill military and businessmen, chop up journalists....but #Iran can’t sell its own oil
4066 2018-11-20 19:23:46 Trump : - Saudi Arabia got oil.
             - MBS may or may not have been involved in Khashogg's killing.

4067 2018-11-20 19:23:38 It’s at July highs and ~1.30-1.31 been a magnet for 6 months. And if Oil shows any life CAD should find its way back around that level. Idk, worth a shot.
4068 2018-11-20 19:23:34 Your anointing is never recognised, it is not wrapped in a white handkerchief, oil or water, it is always revealed.
4069 2018-11-20 19:23:34 I still have the daily stress but had this on top of it so I was miserable. I have friends who swear by yoga and meditation to help them sleep. Also CBD oil. Good luck!

4075 2018-11-20 19:23:13 Saudi school textbooks teach teens hatred, violence, anti-Semitism https://...Screw all male pig Saudis. Hang them all by their testicles and burn them with Pig Oil, very slowly.
4076 2018-11-20 19:23:07 Why is palm oil in literally everything GOOD LORD
4077 2018-11-20 19:23:05 Who exactly is Saudi Arabia going to get backing from if not the west? Russia? China? Not likely unless they want to risk a blockade of Saudi oil in an oil rich world. The Saudis are terrified by the prospect of Iranian oil becoming an option. Pompeo is lying.
4078 2018-11-20 19:23:00 "Blast of snow for New England before record-cold Thanksgiving." Heating Oil down 10 cents a gallon today. Fundamentals is nothing more than a long story for the real reason & that is Technical computerized selling based on the charts. No bottom yet! #Energy #Oil #Commodities
4079 2018-11-20 19:22:57 Guns and oil beats a murdered journalist who worked for a US newspaper. What a world we live in eh?
4080 2018-11-20 19:22:52 Oil is at its lowest in a year. I hope @energy_ke & @KenyaAirways are working hard to secure good supplies of lower priced oil.
4081 2018-11-20 19:22:48 in an attempt to clear out some space in my medicine cabinet, i’ve been putting argan oil in my hair lately. not sure if it’s working, but not sure exactly what it’s supposed to do, either, so i guess i can’t complain
4082 2018-11-20 19:22:45 So we shouldn't worry about human rights violations, or freedom of press, by not even sanctioning them. But then we rush our military in when our oil sources are threatened. I agree, we shouldn't play world's police, but we've been doing that for decades.
4083 2018-11-20 19:22:37 Tonight is a #selfcare night. What do you like to do to feel at your best? I am thinking Made in Chelsea, Bubble bath with new bath oil and reading Michelle Obamas new book tonight :) x (you know how much I love self care ha)
4084 2018-11-20 19:22:31 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
4085 2018-11-20 19:22:30 Don't need educating on that thanks. Just saying there has been a fall at the pumps. Let's hope it falls further. Not just down to oil price though, as you may know, depends on £/$ exchange rate & that's volatile at the moment.
4086 2018-11-20 19:22:28 It will never happen, people are just viewing it on arms deal, look at oil, the consequences will be so dire,with Iran already under sanctions, The world is fully depending on KSA to close that deficit,that's the reality.
4087 2018-11-20 19:22:26 Oil and the cash they’ve lined Trump’s pocket with
4088 2018-11-20 19:22:25 I keep hearing that there's no sheen to be seen on the water, as if that makes it any better. The oil is still out there, even if it's not visible it's still there and spread over many miles. I can't believe the spin they put on this stuff.
4089 2018-11-20 19:22:24 Trump's support of Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with oil. 40% of US oil comes from Canada. 11% from Saudi Arabia. His support is personal, #followthemoney
4090 2018-11-20 19:22:22 16bit Pixel-Art meets classic oil painting... I like it ^^
4091 2018-11-20 19:22:22 the @GreenPartyUS already has a #GreenNewDeal drafted! We don’t need Democrats funded by big oil determining climate change policy #GoGreen
4092 2018-11-20 19:22:22 The DJIA is down more than 500 points, crude oil down 7%, but grains holding on admirably today. corn dn 1, beans up 7, wheat up 2, KC dn 1 #oatt
4093 2018-11-20 19:22:15 But overall magnitude of LDL-C increase on placebo arm is still very similar, not out of range. Would mineral oil also explain placebo arm with increased HDL-C too?
4094 2018-11-20 19:22:12 Coconut oil!! It’s a life saver! Just put on a bunch wherever you’re dry and leave it on for like 15 mins then rinse it off and put moisturizer on
4095 2018-11-20 19:21:57 @Mirabito Oil prices down 30% but your gas prices have not dropped at all! WHY?
4096 2018-11-20 19:21:55 No need to add sugar either. Adding another oil just makes the product go further I would assume. More jars from less peanuts.
4097 2018-11-20 19:21:53 Agree, Canadians should have the right to regulate any oil project through their elected gov't. What Neil Young & other anti-oil lobbyists did was to enable a foreign power (US) to create fake news to allow US producers to replace ours. US manipulates media worst than Russia.
4098 2018-11-20 19:21:49 Coincidence? Ontario & Quebec industries r always coddled by Feds - auto, banks, telcos, insurance, airlines, railways, dairy. Industries Feds have mismanaged: fisheries, forestry, mining, oil & gas, etc r in BC, AB, SK, MN, NF, Atlantic. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #ableg @CanadaWestFdn
4099 2018-11-20 19:21:44 It’s true the maintenance on them is wild. A lot of people here at the university of Illinois have foreign super cars and they all say the same thing. Maintenance is the highest thing. Tires, oil change, etc. but most here from overseas so their parents can afford the high costs.
4100 2018-11-20 19:21:43 He has way too much invested in big oil. It’s all about the money.
4101 2018-11-20 19:21:43 I'd forgotten about that book.  

The fact is that, for years, the US was the dumping ground for dodgy olive oil.

Most Americans prefer the taste of rancid oil.

Oleuropein degrades quickly after pressing if not maintained properly.
4102 2018-11-20 19:21:40 #Seismic/volcanic up-tic ;Reports are suppressed. Volcanic activity= heat from below is rising 2 surface;thus stupid things spark flames. Human activity; fracing, oil wells, weather manipulation makes it (& pollution) worse; question is, why don't the Elite care about the future?
4103 2018-11-20 19:21:35 Carbon tax creates a weaker economy and disaster for our kids and grandkids.  We are losing billions of revenue keeping our oil in the ground.
4104 2018-11-20 19:21:27 Well flooding the market shale oil and the trade disputes with China, is already hurting Saudi Arabia. Another 7.8% drop today in Brent Crude prices.
4105 2018-11-20 19:21:26 Let me get this straight. You are saying oil burns hotter than a nuclear reactor? Think about that for a minute.
4106 2018-11-20 19:21:26 Donald Trump just made a statement on Saudi Arabia, making it very clear, he choses Money and oil over human life.......

He made it very clear
4107 2018-11-20 19:21:23 @hereandnowrobin Your expert guest misspoke.
N95 masks - N refers to not oil resistant. N, R and P masks are all NIOSH approved. N not resistant to oil, R somewhat resistant to oil, P strongly resistant to oil.
4108 2018-11-20 19:21:19 What got 2 me a decade ago, how cld a country apparently as smart as the US let themselves b so dependent on 1 countries oil? Independence Day is a con job.
4109 2018-11-20 19:21:17 is it to find out why why we are giving our oil away

4111 2018-11-20 19:20:58 Yep. I was just reading the Leach Report. It does a good job of explaining that our aim is to make our activities (whether driving or oil production) less emissions-intensive, not to get rid of them or just move them to other countries.
4112 2018-11-20 19:20:50 help i’m stuck on a jet bridge with a guy telling me he gave his dog cbd oil
4113 2018-11-20 19:20:49 Extra sugar, extra salt, extra oil & MSG!
4114 2018-11-20 19:20:48 #StockMarket I will call it now. If oil dumps at current rate into low $40s. This will be the sector that sets off the Debt contagion . Defaults in BBB and Junk in more zombie companies that they anticipate. They have to know this ?? 2019 ??
4115 2018-11-20 19:20:43 Trump on the Khashoggi killing:
-America first!
-Saudi Arabia produces lots of oil
-Saudi Arabia spends lots of money in the US
-Khashoggi was an "enemy of the state", Saudis say
-MBS may or may not have been involved in killing him
-Whatever
-America first!

4118 2018-11-20 19:20:31 so Syrians are not even allowed to get oil until Assad is there? Or shall they buy it from Saudi Arabia? 
4119 2018-11-20 19:20:17 Tea tree oil. Wash your face with your best facial soap. Put a shit load of oil on your skin and drink WATER. U AMERICANS WAVE WATER IN KITCHEN JUST DRINK IT FORGET THAT COCA COLA BE EUROPEAN IDK
4120 2018-11-20 19:20:16 Stop hyping this up. America owes trillions of dollars in debt. So do many other jurisdictions. Governments run deficits. Get our oil to markets, get decent price for our oil. where exactly would you cut back? Education, health care, public services? Ab citizens deserve to know.
4121 2018-11-20 19:20:14 New oil and new wine both involve a crushing. They are both the results of a process of testing and of purification.

4127 2018-11-20 19:19:48 "...very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels".
I think it should be "...requests for keeping oil prices..."
4128 2018-11-20 19:19:46 things i learned from the food network:
-"deconstructed" is code for "i couldn't make the actual dish and now it's a hot mess"
-even tho truffle oil is expensive as hell you should never ever cook with it
-garnishes are for little bitches
4129 2018-11-20 19:19:43 I don't get it. I know "Iran, oil, money", but do we really need them anymore?
4130 2018-11-20 19:19:42 i, too, prefer to flavor my olive oil and garlic with butter and herbs
4131 2018-11-20 19:19:42 “Why do you still get high when CBD oil offers you the benefits, legally, without the high”

Okay, but the eight blunts ima get outta this pack cost me half the price of that lil bottle of drip drop white hipster start up oil y’all out here pushing
4132 2018-11-20 19:19:34 Guns and Oil beats murdered journalists. Nice to know eh?
4133 2018-11-20 19:19:33 Oil, mex asset rout, credit getting rekt... every dealer long this bond (the 29e)... perfect storm basically. Z spread over sovereign BLOWN out. (but serious value here imo, especially xccyhedged)
4134 2018-11-20 19:19:27 I'm biased, but midstream has taken great strides to improve balance sheets & payout ratios while adding long-term contracted cash flow that seems more reliable than buying short cycle oil/gas reserves more dependent on commodity prices, that said nothing trades well w/oil down
4135 2018-11-20 19:19:26 nah, he owned a small oil company
4136 2018-11-20 19:19:19 Does that policy include being able to kill American residents as long as the host country buy guns or sells oil? Asking for a buddy....
4137 2018-11-20 19:19:18 Raise oil prices... It's always about money with him
4138 2018-11-20 19:19:17 What American companies outside of oil and arms doing business there & can we apply pressure there? Oil&arms go hand n hand. Arms wouldnt have much business without oil, dictators and dirty $ to war over...Green energy tech is a huge threat so oil/arms megadonors buy our demise
4139 2018-11-20 19:19:10 November 2017 crude oil price 62.40/bbl= petrol price in Mumbai 73 r.s,, now November 2018 same crude price but petrol price 82 reason?
4140 2018-11-20 19:19:07 By the way - The petrodollar is how the world pays for oil ie in USA dollars - should that end the dollar comes flooding back home and the currency becomes toilet paper - might want to study some economics and learn a little before posting shit.
4141 2018-11-20 19:19:05 uwuwuwu thank you claudia ;;;;
I wanted it to look really soft and atmospheric kinda like old oil portraits :')
4142 2018-11-20 19:19:03 Trump statement summarized: MBS maybe involved in Khashoggi killing but Saudi Arabia with its oil, with being buyer of US weapons, with being US regional ally cannot be pushed away or punished.
4143 2018-11-20 19:18:57 Se cayo todo.. el OIL - 7% los mercados afuera en rojo

4145 2018-11-20 19:18:53 We need to protect California forests by cutting them down! We need to protect California beaches by eliminating regulations on oil drilling!
4146 2018-11-20 19:18:48 Man listen....baby oil smells so good. How one put me on 
4147 2018-11-20 19:18:46 No one wants to make love to you while staring at his Grand-Uncle's sad face
4148 2018-11-20 19:18:45 American foreign policy as a force for good has just been trumped by a bankrupt  leader who supports the killer and punished those who carried out his orders... because they have a lot of oil and cash. A sad day for a proud nation. Real damage that will take decades to repair.

4151 2018-11-20 19:18:31 Nearly died eating pho. Choked on a hot pepper. My face lit up when the pepper got stuck in my throat. Somehow I managed to rub the oil from the pepper into my eyes. Otherwise the soup was good. I will return for more. #phohoa

4154 2018-11-20 19:18:08 Exactly! We are only acting concerned because the case is so high profile. Truth is we will prostitute our morales for $ and oil. Pick a lane America!!
4155 2018-11-20 19:18:07 oil looks like it'll puke again.. -10% day?

4161 2018-11-20 19:17:43 Yes they confirmed it. Not surprisingly the palm oil ad was just cashing in on the vegan pound while making decisions that actually harmed more animals! #veganhour

4171 2018-11-20 19:17:12 My message is clear and important to Dr. Fuad Hussein if you made me a consultant on customs and taxes through my experience and my youth tag to make their revenues the second resource for Iraq after oil time
4172 2018-11-20 19:17:05 I still like the traditional family version but elevated. 

So instead of the box of dried croutons, I like to take a couple loaves of bread and toast them with olive oil, garlic and rosemary...

no boxed stock, homemade...

But what monster uses cornbread?

4180 2018-11-20 19:16:25 So, may be unpopular to say, but here's the deal: the Saudis can do us some serious harm. All they would have to do is shut down the pumps & oil prices wld skyrocket. Last time prices spiked we had a Great Recession
4181 2018-11-20 19:16:23 But not bush?? Or his father? .. the war was already started by the time Obama came he could only be so humanitarian in a war to suppress the oil rich Middle East that has terrible problems with us from old feuds & so we can’t let them get to big & destroy us!!

4187 2018-11-20 19:16:06 also crop is good and sun oil has more 130 per ton up palm oil make less demand form India and other buyers like Egypt and China
4188 2018-11-20 19:16:04 I'd never say "well done" to @Momentum_za    If they were not harassed/trolled on social media, they would have done nothing, nada, dololo!  Snake oil scum.
4189 2018-11-20 19:15:55 Oil tanking: Brent down 7.6 per cent — or $5.08 a barrel to an over 11-month low of $61.71 before recovering slightly to trade at $62.23. West Texas Intermediate down 7 per cent — or $3.99 a barrel to $52.77 — its weakest level since October 2017.
4190 2018-11-20 19:15:53 You obviously have no clue how the world works. Billions in trade $$ and oil prices are at stake for our economy. He was a Saudi, he wasn't even a US citizen. Report on how many of their own citizens they kill each year and have been for decades under EVERY President here.
4191 2018-11-20 19:15:49 I Remember Raj Oil Mills 
4192 2018-11-20 19:15:47 @Clearcast what are you doing to get the law changed or challenged? Also why do you not consider WWF political? No problem with approving their adverts?! Or is it that you can’t diss palm oil seeing as you’re owned by HSBC who invested huge sums in palm oil? #Rangtan
4193 2018-11-20 19:15:46 U.S. power in the world pivots on Saudi Arabia maintaining the US dollar as the primary currency of global oil trade. Is interesting that liberal elites are indifferent to this basic power dynamics.
4194 2018-11-20 19:15:43 His position shows weakness (and more likely he has been compromised) so he succumbs to tolerating bad behavior. That’s not protecting American interest, oil, arms sales and hotels are trivial to weakness
4195 2018-11-20 19:15:42 IT ALL #TRUE BUT WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY #CHOICES IN THE #MiddleEast. #Saudi_Arabia IS A STRONG & #DEPENDABLE PARTNER & ALWAYS HELP #AMERICA IN CONTROLLING #OIL #GUTS OR #SHORTAGES.

4200 2018-11-20 19:14:57 They would be branded a terrorist country 

Plus Saudi was one of the country’s that JR met with, and they too blasted America with lies, misinformation and propaganda

Saudi is no ally, they use America for arms, jack up oil prices when they want to hurt the US economy
4201 2018-11-20 19:14:47 sana oil
4202 2018-11-20 19:14:46 White European imperialists tried to take the whole region for themselves, did a piss poor job of setting up stable, independent nations when they couldn’t, and then went around overthrowing those nations’ governments when they wouldn’t give white people their oil.
4203 2018-11-20 19:14:46 The council need to look into the Taxi  garages in that area...oil leaks everywhere and one of the roads under the bridge has a number of dumped taxis!!

4209 2018-11-20 19:14:23 FANG and tech looks a lot better now.. but there are some dept problems in the world economy and asia etc. and the oil.. #howlowcanitgo
4210 2018-11-20 19:14:19 Notley always hires out of province. And they are always anti oil activist.
4211 2018-11-20 19:14:12 No, it's not.  We have oil, plenty of it.  To say we need theirs... well someone's blowing up your skirt, darling.
4212 2018-11-20 19:14:09 Peppermint oil in the roof of ur mouth. Or just smelling it
4213 2018-11-20 19:14:07 Pass the oil.
4214 2018-11-20 19:14:04 pass me the oil è corretto?
4215 2018-11-20 19:13:49 It is a nice ratio.  Thanks for posting,

It would be even nicer and more convincing if this ratio is due to :

1. the breakout of $GOLD for a "Safe-Haven" play;
2. the breakdown of $Oil for a economic downturn confirmation.
4216 2018-11-20 19:13:49 One day Saudi Arabia will be out of oil and then we won’t be friends anymore. GOOD.
4217 2018-11-20 19:13:44 What’s ridiculous is not that SPY is going down , but how oil can’t catch a bid.
4218 2018-11-20 19:13:43 The Saudis have been US allies since the patron saint of the Dem party FDR used an oil embargo to incite Japan to attack our sitting-duck naval installation at Pearl Harbor thus creating public outrage that quashed civilian reluctance and had US clamoring to enter WWII.
4219 2018-11-20 19:13:43 I like when I go to a oil change place and they explain things as simple as possible for me. I don’t know jack shit about cars. I need to move back home so my man can do this shit for me.
4220 2018-11-20 19:13:42 Haha! Especially if it's coconut oil and that smell is everywhere. I feel you.

4225 2018-11-20 19:13:11 They are distracting with Pompao with his sideshow.  The emails are still on the table.  Iran has oil they want it! Saudi has money they want it and Russia is leading them all by the nose!
4226 2018-11-20 19:13:10 hey everyone it’s thanksgiving week so don’t forget to put gravy in your essential oil diffusers

4228 2018-11-20 19:12:56 Don't panic and take it slowly. For beautiful roast potatoes and parsnips, parboil them first, drain, shake in the saucepan with the lid on to roughen the edges and sprinkle some flour over them. Then add the to the hot roasting pan and gently cover them with the hot oil.
4229 2018-11-20 19:12:51 Dollars > Lives. Weapons > Lives. Oil > Lives. Lies > Lives. How do the people in this admin live with themselves? How do they sleep at night? Once this nightmare is over, I hope they find themselves forever unemployed and friendless

4234 2018-11-20 19:12:39 But did they do it for oil and military reasons? It seems like Trump is doing more for personal financial protection.
4235 2018-11-20 19:12:35 Whoa, I didn't realize all the immigrants are from oil rich Nigeria and no where else. Thank you for pointing that out.
4236 2018-11-20 19:12:33 Another article from a guy at a University long captured by the oil patch.
Could it possibly be that prices are down now because there is a surplus?  Otherwise how do you explan $100/barrel oil a few years ago?  Same #pipeline capacity as then. #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli
4237 2018-11-20 19:12:30 If you have money/oil you can stone cold murder whoever you want and get away with it. So sayeth Trump.
4238 2018-11-20 19:12:28 Too busy building coffins to measure out the correct amount of oil.

4240 2018-11-20 19:12:18 And here come sector BDC issues once more. PennantPark is a highly exposed BDC to oil, with 12% of portfolio at fair value in energy. Now BBB- ratings is placed on negative watch negative by Fitch.
4241 2018-11-20 19:12:14 you mean like all the free stuff we give away to banks, corporate america, oil companies, defense contractors?  that free stuff?
4242 2018-11-20 19:12:06 Let’s sit out of that war. We’re the world’s leading oil producer and don’t need anything from either country. Let’s pretend we’re the UN - advocate for peace and watch sadly. They drag us in and then people come terrorize us later. We must choose to stay out of it. Stay blessed.

4254 2018-11-20 19:11:49 I saw someone today saying buying oil is easy money here ...... commodities aint easy folks
4255 2018-11-20 19:11:44 You might want to check the prices that other oil exporting countries are getting for their product right now & compare that to what ours is selling for. It's very clearly a market access problem.

4280 2018-11-20 19:10:13 Also below is from a brother in the Lord I asked his opinion about this:

Pray that the Holy Spirit will fill the house making no room for demons. Anointing with oil is OK so long as we always remember that the oil itself has no power. it is merely an outward "expression" of
4281 2018-11-20 19:10:09 wow, hard to believe the Pope of Capitalism put out a press release officially stating the Saudi Arabian royal family is allowed to purchase indulgences on mortal sins explicitly because of their nation's oil reserves
4282 2018-11-20 19:10:08 Mr. Get Tough On NATO Allies can't bring himself to deliver even the most mild reproach of a country that tortured and killed a journalist because "security and safety" oh and also they pump a lot of oil

4294 2018-11-20 19:09:36 Seems unlikely to be a growth narrative pushing #oil lower. Iran sanction threats was the narrative , waivers the narrative . From memory, impact of inventory data seems shortlived. Current price levels are a sweetspot for global growth (lower skew between winners & losers)

4296 2018-11-20 19:09:31 Socialism in Europe works. On average EVERYONE pays 40%. If WE all paid 40%, we too could have 'free stuff'. Oh, and in Noway, the COUNTRY drills for/sells the oil. Gas is about $8-$9 per gallon. But "free" tuition, "free" healthcare. So if you earn $50k and pay $20k tax...

4302 2018-11-20 19:09:04 He’s definitely an amazing oil painter. It’s sad he thinks a man that refuses to excessed, due to “humans having  finites amount of energy”. Can be a professional football player.

4303 2018-11-20 19:08:58 I hate that when I oil my hair the night before I’ve committed to showering first thing in the morning. Frankly, the audacity of Past Me to make such decisions.
4304 2018-11-20 19:08:57 Does it seem that gas prices go up much faster when oil goes up than the inverse case?  I think it's a good example of making money at the margins.

4322 2018-11-20 19:07:43 One reason is it seems to increase pretty quickly, and then drop, not linearly as seen there. Another is that the mineral oil concern was previously raised.
4323 2018-11-20 19:07:31 Because the akara gives success and carries full cow abi??,that person need change of new oil for brain.
4324 2018-11-20 19:07:27 Risk aversion intensified, sending equities lower - the S&P500 gapped down 1.6%. Brent crude oil fell a whopping 7% to $62 – the lowest since February – on growing concerns about supply.  US bond yields fell and the US dollar rose.
4325 2018-11-20 19:07:22 *gets oil cartridge right before thanksgiving so i can be ready for that meal*
4326 2018-11-20 19:07:20 I would love to oil them up for u
4327 2018-11-20 19:07:14 Money, oil and arms deals dictate the 3 monkeys philosophy - hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Find some excuse to hide behind so that the deals can continue to enrich Trumputin, his sprogs and the brown nose sycophants.
4328 2018-11-20 19:07:14 Fool.... the war was already started by the time Obama came he could only be so humanitarian in a war to suppress the oil rich Middle East that has terrible problems with them from old feuds & we can’t let them get to big & destroy us!! THEY CRAZY

4330 2018-11-20 19:07:06 My brand new classic 350 cc purchased in july 18 which is done with only 1700km had a gear shift problem, which was rectified by ur authorized service center by opening the whole engine. Now due to this there is heavy noise coming from the engine and oil leak from the bore assy
4331 2018-11-20 19:07:06 Oil too
4332 2018-11-20 19:06:55 Saudi Arabia gets away with murder twice.  No punishment for 9/11 and now by Trump. Oil buys a lot of death.
4333 2018-11-20 19:06:49 As long as not fried in palm oil, we'll let you off.
4334 2018-11-20 19:06:43 Shorter version:

It's about oil.

TRUMP: maybe he murdered her, maybe he didn't, we'll never really know, but he does possess a lot of oil
4338 2018-11-20 19:06:33 I use hazelnut oil, water and resuable coton pads. Will never go back ! Give it a try 
4339 2018-11-20 19:06:28 Lo he visualizado como un meme de esos de "Oil detected. You guys need freedom".
4340 2018-11-20 19:06:26 Peanut oil?
4341 2018-11-20 19:06:25 I once did. It’s was as if they were prepared on a prime stove under a bridge in recycled cooking oil and gravy 
4342 2018-11-20 19:06:18 Most are well hedged from that I know - oh you hear enough down here trust me - natgas making people happy though - the common reply is doesn't Trump know we are happy with $58-60 oil and why doesn't he not comment lol
4343 2018-11-20 19:06:16 They add oil to the fire

4346 2018-11-20 19:06:12 Wouldn't that make it Hemp ice cream then? (I use hemp oil since CBD oil isn't legal here and it does help inflammation and whatnot without the high)
4347 2018-11-20 19:05:56 I feel my dumbest when getting my oil changed, I literally never know what they are saying to me about my car
4348 2018-11-20 19:05:52 Only proves that strategic relations go beyond money. US oil is largely shale & consumed internally. Saudi & Russia remain global player in energy markets and US output can’t be ignored
4349 2018-11-20 19:05:45 I really drove 10k miles since my last oil change wowwww
4350 2018-11-20 19:05:33 Today the President said it’s okay if Saudi Arabia kills someone they don’t like because they buy a lot of stuff from our defense contractors and produce a lot of oil.

4354 2018-11-20 19:05:09 I used to have problems with that. I started cleaning my hair with ACV to really get off all product build up and prime my hair to take more moisture. and now I oil my scalp daily with tea tree and black caster oil.
4355 2018-11-20 19:05:05 Maybe it’s a by-product of the oil industry. 
4356 2018-11-20 19:05:04 There are commodity sales in Tier 1 US banks targeting oil at 100 in 2019....really?
4357 2018-11-20 19:05:02 із твоєї статті: Trump, however, has exceeded expectations on jobs and economic growth that were in place at the start of 2017. That’s due in part because of his tax cut, but also because of factors largely beyond his control, such as the increase in oil prices.
4358 2018-11-20 19:05:01 Oh to be the fly on the wall and listen and see how @AndurandPierre trades oil
4359 2018-11-20 19:04:58 So wait a minute, you don't know that all our military installations worldwide are solely for protection and control of oil and natural gas for the multinational energy companies who we start wars for?
4360 2018-11-20 19:04:51 Look at the #USDCAD run babbbyyy!!

4362 2018-11-20 19:04:49 It's not a statement to you, it's a statement to Europe telling them to back off if they like their oil at a decent price.
4363 2018-11-20 19:04:48 Whilst Norway has a Trillion dollar oil fund to rely on. Again, who is best placed?
4364 2018-11-20 19:04:47 Perhaps building an economy around an oil monoculture is a really bad idea!
4365 2018-11-20 19:04:46 So it turns out that Palm Oil is a massive problem in Tullamore. The world is ending!

週末行きます！
4367 2018-11-20 19:04:37 Saudi Arabia can kill whoever it wants because money, because oil. It's the world's #1 terrorist state and gets away with it because money, because oil. Saudi Arabia is a should-be pariah state that everyone wants to befriend because money, because oil. None of this will change.
4368 2018-11-20 19:04:31 Why are people still slating Nutella for using palm oil? Ferrero has been credited by third parties including WWF and Greenpeace for its work sourcing sustainable palm oil. They are 100% certified by RSPO. 
4369 2018-11-20 19:04:26 And wants their oil and money.
4370 2018-11-20 19:04:26 Oh shit I forgot about chicken wings. They come out amazing with almost no oil at all, just spray a little each time you flip them.
4371 2018-11-20 19:04:24 Oil from Exxon Valdez has accentuated the muscles of Sea Lions on the Alaska coastline.
4372 2018-11-20 19:04:23 I was part of a paranormal investigation group for a short while, we did some charity events, which involved some of the Most Haunted team as well for publicity. What a bunch of fakes, never seen such a bunch of snake oil salesmen in z list celebrity form in all my life.
4373 2018-11-20 19:04:20 Yep... and 20 drops of Jasmine essential oil
4374 2018-11-20 19:04:19 olive oil
4375 2018-11-20 19:04:06 Old allie or rather frenamy. They trade their oil in US $. That's important. They buy lots of US product, that's important and they are a bulwark against militant Shia that threatens Israel.
4376 2018-11-20 19:04:02 Thank god for my boyfriend, I no longer have to deal with the anxiety I get when dealing with oil changes or renewing my registration 
4377 2018-11-20 19:03:58 Nothing to do with oil. It's all about trump investments, abroad and at home. That's it. Trump couldn't care less about what we pay for gas at the pump.
4378 2018-11-20 19:03:33 Trump needs to stop using that "America First" slogan, it's more like "Trump First," because he always puts money, weapons, oil and other egregious sh** above his oath for Americans period. #facts
4379 2018-11-20 19:03:29 It is said that the Prophet chose a green colored flag to represent the Islamic republic during his life. Candles and oil lamps (Chiragan) are lit on the eve of 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal to welcome the Prophet’s arrival and to celebrate his birth.#سرکارﷺ_کی_آمد_مرحبا
4380 2018-11-20 19:03:27 The assumption that the Saudi's sole ambition is maximizing present value of cash flows from oil reserves misses a lot IMO.  Those are 3 interesting externalities you mention as one is ST, one medium term, and one LT.  Each may not get the weighting that NPV analysis suggests.

4382 2018-11-20 19:03:25 That graph shows the deforestation going on in Borneo over the years, and ofc how much habitat the orangutang is losing because of palm oil
4383 2018-11-20 19:03:24 UK's revenue base can service her debt, 
if oil prices slump again we'd be in a debt crisis

like water , FDI flows to places of list resistance
They are paying lip service cuz Buhari has created a hostile economy
loans and FPI don't translate to economic growth and jobs

4385 2018-11-20 19:03:14 We didn't find oil in Leduc until a decade after that so it really puts things in perspective.
4386 2018-11-20 19:03:11 What?  Junior Trudeau didn’t make the list despite Canada’s massive oil reserves!  Its time to dump that loser.
4387 2018-11-20 19:03:06 I expected you to yell at me about not getting an oil change, this is a much better response
4388 2018-11-20 19:03:05 Chk has wild horse  hope fully February shows some big number in oil rev
4389 2018-11-20 19:02:58 Are you giving us your sales pitch?, because I can show support from about 10-20 power 5 coaches that say the exact opposite. Stars are BS too and just like you are doing, a way to line the pockets of snake oil salesmen.

4398 2018-11-20 19:02:29 Coconut oil is oily & can clog pores if you don’t rinse it off, but it’s hands down the cheapest makeup remover I’ve ever used. I’ve been using micellar (or whatever) water and that works just as good. My only complaint is the filmy oil feeling it leaves if you don’t rinse after

4401 2018-11-20 19:02:18 no like they smell weird, i was walking in the hall after 2nd period and they smelled like raw fish and fried canola oil i was like????
4402 2018-11-20 19:02:13 We need their oil. We know and they know it. If only there was a way to reduce our dependance on foreign oil. I'm going to grab my pipe and write a few lines about this and see if I can solve this head scratcher
4403 2018-11-20 19:02:06 The U.S. imports nearly 1 million barrels/day of crude oil from them. We sell them astronomical amounts of weaponry (e.g., 112 billion during Obama's eight years). Hmmm...could it possibly be a classic illustration of the old adage "Money talks...bulls**t walks"?
4404 2018-11-20 19:01:51 American citizens are now for sale to the highest bidder. No one is safe.

We used to bemoan going to war for oil. We have now skipped the oil part and just trade blood for money.

#ThanksGOP
4405 2018-11-20 19:01:50 Pools of oil?We’ll be putting the rent up soon.Pray tell us how much we’ve contributed to the Syrian,Libyan and Iraqi bombing campaigns, alongside your superannuated weapons of mass destruction and of course HS2, the Buck House refurb, Westminster refurb,etc.Don’t patronise us.
4406 2018-11-20 19:01:46 I can still hear the roar echo round my lug oil, as a kid you didn't realise what that goal actually meant.
4407 2018-11-20 19:01:42 but it be a great place to put some Russian or Chinese ships and some hyper-sonic missiles. PR got something that just as important as oil. A main strategic location that worth it weight in gold to a enemy of the US

4427 2018-11-20 19:00:04 Ethics are the core to who we are as individuals, not groups.  Anytime we want people to share our fundamental beliefs, and try to shame people into that, it does not work.  This is why these two sides are like oil to water.  Their philosophy is incompatible.

4442 2018-11-20 18:59:12 So, as long as there are personal business ties and oil dependencies in play, it’s completely cool to murder journalists. That’s the message this sends and the bar that has been set.
4443 2018-11-20 18:59:11 نعم صحيح ... 
تركيز السلطات في يد محمد بن سلمان امر غير إيجابي على الاطلاق .
4444 2018-11-20 18:59:09 If the Trump's priorities hinge on cheap oil, we've got a lot of that here in Canada. Some might even call it "ethical" oil.
4445 2018-11-20 18:59:06 This Cheap Oil Crowd has made a terrible miscalculation. Expect "un-scheduled maintenance" & shutdowns worldwide. Mr. Trump's personal business interests in the desert will not turn the oil industry into a Not-for-profit-charity. Something's gonna break.
4446 2018-11-20 18:58:59 Mine literally just turned on, needs an oil change tho so I’m good

4451 2018-11-20 18:58:39 I also assisted my paternal grandmother to sell epo-pupa (palm oil) while I supported my maternal grandmother to sell hot water starch. I did double major while growing up. Epo-pupa at Isale-Eko  and starch at Ebute-Metta.
4452 2018-11-20 18:58:38 @selectedwisdom - several sites do list U.S. as top producer of oil. Some do not. Dacts?

4455 2018-11-20 18:58:04 Are you dehydrated? Even just a little bit can make your anxiety get out of control. 4 my anxiety, I have to drink around 6 glasses a day while taking CBD oil, I get ten minutes of sun with meditation a day, and I used to use those shakes you give the elderly to get nutrients in
4456 2018-11-20 18:58:02 It does matter because the oil market isn't segmented - prices are set globally. Even a country taking no imports from the Saudis is subject to their influence. I agree abt infrastructure, but also a "Manhattan Project" for scalable solar/wind/fusion/thorium should be priority
4457 2018-11-20 18:57:59 @realDonaldTrump Oil!  Oily!  Trump.
4458 2018-11-20 18:57:55 This also makes Canadian oil politics more bizarre and interesting.

4460 2018-11-20 18:57:49 This is from oil in the water???

4465 2018-11-20 18:57:20 #ClimateCollapse isn’t a midterm -- it’s multi-disasters we're already paying for and what politicians, oil. gas and coal addicts are making worse. #GreenNewDeal #JustTransition #ExtinctionRebellion
4466 2018-11-20 18:57:12 Didn’t trump say once (several times) that he was responsible for the stock markets? I see they are tanking, in part, because of oil/Saudi dealings. Luckily for him, he seems to be able to have it both ways. Sucks for the rest of us though...
4467 2018-11-20 18:57:12 Impressed with its performance vs other midstream names like KMi, OKE today, usually LNG trades with oil and has higher beta.  Encouraging to see what appears to be investor base turnover to stickier money
4468 2018-11-20 18:57:02 But we need the prices to stay low for another 6 to 7 months. And then till the next 10 years. Modi should threaten to turn the spigot on electrification if oil crosses 65$ at any point of time from now on.

4471 2018-11-20 18:56:45 If the scientists paid him to say he believes in climate change, he might consider it ...but then big oil would change his mind.
4472 2018-11-20 18:56:36 Since they have effectively infinite water maybe the structure will be ok in the end because it’s hard to maintain combustion when the oil is very diluted?
4473 2018-11-20 18:56:36 "Sanctioning" implies prior approval / permission... therefore I'm not prepared to follow you down that rabbit hole. I also don't want to think about Trump pivoting his oil trade allegiance to Mother Russia as is his plan anyway.
4474 2018-11-20 18:56:27 US Treasury accuses Iran for funneling oil into Syria through Russian networks. Someone needs to tell the Treasury that Syria is its own country and not American territory.
4475 2018-11-20 18:56:25 Just wait they finish shorting oil

4480 2018-11-20 18:56:12 Trump is an old school huckster. Find a group of people that want to believe in a sales pitch and give that pitch to them. Trump is like the people in the old west that sold snake oil - even down to the plants in the crowd to further convince people.
4481 2018-11-20 18:56:11 Javad, Iran has miscalculated AGAIN !  Stop crowing, Trump is playing you while NIOC is screwing up oil sales while US is taking your market share.  When will you guys ever learn?  If you don't catch on Trump will win. Genuine best of luck.

4497 2018-11-20 18:54:25 Just learned that the @SupremeCtofPA will hear an appeal in a closely watched case over whether the so-called rule of capture, which protects drillers from trespassing claims over drainage of free-flowing oil and gas below neighboring properties, applies to #fracking.
4498 2018-11-20 18:54:24 Do you understand what will happen to gas prices if Saudi Arabia turns on America and start selling oil in other currencies?

Turns out you can get away with any old shit if you've got oil... and you give the Trump and Kushner families lots of cash.
4505 2018-11-20 18:54:04 I agree, as a Millwright tradesman myself, I see my fellow tradesmen have run out time, patience and money. Worse, most oil sands trades are high tech and require the journeyman, apprentice relationship, hard to do when journeyman are fleeing the prov.

4522 2018-11-20 18:52:57 Well actually manufacturing is 10% of Canada's economy. oil and gas is 9% by 2030 50% of all jobs in major cities will be automated....

Nat gas should be used not burned off, and LNG is the future. Yes the harper share buy semi payed off, unlike the Trudeau loan write off

4526 2018-11-20 18:52:50 I'm gonna be realistic here, if Saudi Arabia wanted to is it possible that they could ruin the U.S. economy by cutting off oil supply?

To avoid the onion smell you can boil those too. Chebé powder be careful because I read it is something you need to stick to, otherwise

4539 2018-11-20 18:52:04 No doubt Bush was also very close to them too.  Obama tolerated them. But then again, wasn't the whole idea of opening all this drilling supposed to be about independence from foreign oil?  Why hasn't their influence waned accordingly?

4558 2018-11-20 18:51:24 While we can't know ahead of time exactly how much oil will flow through the TMX, if it ran at capacity for 60 years,it would ultimately melt ~4,500 cubic kms of ice; that is 80 times larger than the 55 cubic km of glaciers in Alberta,which is critical for maintaining summer flow

4586 2018-11-20 18:49:39 Donald, we don’t need their oil anymore! We are drilling more oil domestically than we can use ! We are exporting oil ! Screw them ! Unless, you’re worried about yiur business interests in Saudi Arabia?
4587 2018-11-20 18:49:34 "They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels..."

4591 2018-11-20 18:49:16 At least he was honest in admitting oil prices & defense industry profits drove his spineless decision, vs pandering to falsehoods that he may in any way care about human rights or true American values. #fb
4592 2018-11-20 18:49:16 Olive oil is not cheap 
4593 2018-11-20 18:49:13 After they steal Syria's & Iran's oil (and gold), the out-of-control @CIA obviously plans to steal Saudi Arabia's. KSA's Ambassador to the U.S., @kbsalsaud, would be wise to advise his country to buy Russian arms, since the USA is a greater threat to their kingdom than is Russia.
4594 2018-11-20 18:49:04 Wearing a coconut oil hair mask to the gym always seems like a good idea (heat from the scalp during HIIT and cardio helps the hair follicles rehydrate etc etc) until you forget to wear your hat on your way home and your hair nearly breaks off in chunks...... lol
4595 2018-11-20 18:49:03 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
4596 2018-11-20 18:49:01  yes. So so so much oil...mujhay to lagta hai bechara is ke baad Das din bemaar raha hoga

4600 2018-11-20 18:48:51 Shots/vaccinations. I know it freaks people out, causing the “not wanting to inject ourselves or kids with a shot”. I bet if it came in a simple form, like a pill or CBD oil type thing, I bet it’d be more effective.
4601 2018-11-20 18:48:46 Yeah.... I'm actually with you on this one.  As bad as it seems...we need the Saudis...and not just for oil. Ironically, it makes the destruction of Iraq and Saddam all the more problematic.
4602 2018-11-20 18:48:45  Brent crude dropped $4.72, or 7.1 percent, to $62.07 a barrel.

The international benchmark for oil prices hit a fresh eight-month low today. 

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) plunged $4.18, or 7.3 percent, to $53.02, hitting its lowest level going back to October 2017.

4604 2018-11-20 18:48:41 I know what trans and hydrogenated oils are. What I mean by "toxic" oil is that the science is showing that vegetable oils are inherently of poor quality and have toxic effects on the body. BTW, I'm NOT trying to put you on the spot @kenjilopezalt
4605 2018-11-20 18:48:34 No, he doesn't--the whole point of the statement is that the U.S. doesn't really give a shit what he's guilty of doing as long as he has oil and contracts with Boeing and opposes Iran. It's the most candid, reductio ad absurdum realpolitik statement ever issued.
4606 2018-11-20 18:48:23 As a long term oil bull, I love this move.  What a great opportunity to go discount shopping.
4607 2018-11-20 18:48:21 US Treasury sanctions on Syria's oil transfer company on Global Vision Group are the beginning of a roadmap for mapping the geopolitical map
4608 2018-11-20 18:48:20 Absolutely although the Republic of Armenia is more butter than olive oil for obvious reasons.
4609 2018-11-20 18:48:15 TMP could be moving oil as we speak, wouldn't mean a damn thing in regards to CL/LCO pricing.
4610 2018-11-20 18:48:10 But what will it be replaced with and how sustainable is that alternative? Also a lot of palm oil comes from Colombia (and is perfectly sustainable), devoid of orangutans of course.
4611 2018-11-20 18:48:09 That’s what I’ve been using. Plus the pinkness oil.  Still dry

4613 2018-11-20 18:48:01 15/19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi. King Salman stated clearly 9-11 was an Israeli plot.
Same story, different day. Oil, military contracts, military bases, we’re beholden to the Saudi regime.
4614 2018-11-20 18:47:53 Or just "Oil industry trade groups decry EV subsidies"
4615 2018-11-20 18:47:52 i think next year when trudeau and liberals are gone, gas and oil sector should rally hard......
4616 2018-11-20 18:47:50 All economy. Oil and natural gas prices up. Economy good. He is up. Oil down. Invade countries. Stoke nationalist base. Suppress press. Find scapegoat. Wait for oil prices to rise again. Repeat.
4617 2018-11-20 18:47:37 Yeah I YouTube a lotta skin care stuff. But I dilute it with water too & use it on my face. They say tea tree oil works for a lotta different things. One of em making my skin glow but idk which one lol

4619 2018-11-20 18:47:34 Like any marginal producer of a commodity, Saudi will seek to maximize its revs on a PV basis. But there are three new/greater externalities in play:Saudi’s worsening fiscal situation, the growth(and lower marginal costs)in the US E&P space, and the increased risk of trapped oil.

4629 2018-11-20 18:47:04 All wars in the Middle East are over oil. They want war with Iran so Saudi can have a pipeline to Europe. We attached Iraq BC their government wat the profit from oil go to the people. Why do you think we had a lot of soldiers guarding the oil fields?

4632 2018-11-20 18:46:57 They recently did a study that the prescription stuff is wayyyy better. If you find that store bought fish oil doesn’t work, try flaxseed oil. It’s got more types of Omega, if I recall correctly.

“They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels – so important for the world.”
4655 2018-11-20 18:45:19 Oil prices tumbled more than 7 percent on Tuesday, with U.S. crude  plunging to its lowest in over a year, caught in Wall Street's broader  selloff fed by growing concerns about slowing global growth.
4656 2018-11-20 18:45:14  It’s so depressing everytime something doesn’t work!! So mentally draining  I’m literally open to trying ANYTHING, my Dads friend just started on cannabis oil but  he’s taking it as pain relief from prostate cancer, not sure how effective it’s been for him just yet
4657 2018-11-20 18:45:08 clean up as you go along and use olive oil instead of other fats

4662 2018-11-20 18:44:56 @ShashiTharoor Wake up opposition, there has been a significant drop of 30% (including the 7% decline today) in the price of crude oil over the past 7 weeks. High time to protest if there is no considerable reduction in the fuel / gas prices. Aam admi should get some benefit now.
4663 2018-11-20 18:44:45 Oil might hit $12.00 lmaoooo hit doesn't mean anything, average price for the year bud!!!! Companies don't generate revenue based on one day of oil prices. It's average lots of my cos have decent hedges as well. Do your homework

4670 2018-11-20 18:44:29 Very early to say but lets hope! I've got a lot of support here but oil & support levels haven't gotten along well lately

4674 2018-11-20 18:44:15 A little trick for gals to plump up their lips a bit...mix either olive oil or coconut oil with a little cinnamon . Create a paste and put on your lips, leave in for a bit and wash off. Natural plumper. 
4675 2018-11-20 18:44:11 because we can’t afford to be cut off from the oil, but also because they are a vital foothold in the region for the US. We conduct military operations on their soil and in their airspace. If we couldn’t do that our influence in the region would be almost zero. Chaos would ensue.

4678 2018-11-20 18:44:03 The Problem is that Trump Need Saudi Arabia regarding the oil. He damage the supply of oil from Iran. Now he cannot start a war with Saudi Arabia.  He has to eat now his own shit.
4679 2018-11-20 18:43:58 Page 40 onwards for North Sea oil and gas - non whisky food and drink sales I assume is covered by Corporate (page 15) and VAT (page 13) sections unless you meant something else?
4680 2018-11-20 18:43:57 I did! I sliced about a pound of shallots, put them in a saucepan and poured oil until they were barely covered. Cooked on high until golden brown. Took about 20-25 minutes for them to cook.
4681 2018-11-20 18:43:56 Got that oil change and that tune up 
4682 2018-11-20 18:43:53 But their oil is so good...
4683 2018-11-20 18:43:53 So, the main issue now is what's been promised by the Oil to Hitch and vice-versa. Chia mentioned making the playoffs as the goal but does that 100 pct jive with 56-98 in the top six? Has that been an instruction given to Hitch? Because if it hasnt, then that's a new/old problem
4684 2018-11-20 18:43:53 Leaves from parks and green space are composted, street leaves can’t be because they are contaminated with oil. They are burned in the incinerator and create electricity. Hope helpful
4685 2018-11-20 18:43:51 It could be ugly. Totally unpredictable given huge run ups over the past 2 years. Could swing harder down.

4696 2018-11-20 18:42:51 Except the idiot is you because you don't even know where the NPR-A.  Because you never been to Alaska you have no clue what the NPR-A is.  Oil drilling takes place between the NPR-A and ANWR.  This expansion is for NPR-A.
4697 2018-11-20 18:42:49 Which sounds good, until you factor in the emissions from building, maintaining and transporting all the fuel and oil that's needed for electric cars to drive on - which can be as much as 50% of a regular car's emissions...
4698 2018-11-20 18:42:47 Already under notable price pressure for a few weeks due to concerns about global demand and higher supply(including US),the #oil market now appears to be unwinding a political risk element following remarks on #SaudiArabia by President @realDonaldTrump . Oil prices are down 7.5%
4699 2018-11-20 18:42:40 Trump also re-ups his argument that Saudi Arabia is willing to spend billions of dollars on American products, especially defense equipment; and to help lower oil prices.
So, whatever CIA said about MBS and Khashoggi murder, he's putting it aside.

4701 2018-11-20 18:42:17 @realDonaldTrump I just read your statement regarding Saudi Arabia and the Kashoggi murder.  As far i as can tell you are more concerned with making money and cheap oil than the state ordered murder of a renowned journalist.  May you brun in hell for choosing money over life.
4702 2018-11-20 18:42:17 I honestly find they don’t remove my makeup well at all. I have to use an oil cleanser, or a balm and let go in with these. Never these alone though
4703 2018-11-20 18:42:06 You're a hypocrite Miya. You benefit from Saudi oil every day. Are you going to stop driving?
4704 2018-11-20 18:42:06 Oil will hit 45$
4705 2018-11-20 18:42:01 wow, go thing it is not 1 drop of oil in that sewage-other wise they would have "green protesters" there.....
4706 2018-11-20 18:41:56 Bro don't worry we are getting up their wait till the oil comes
4707 2018-11-20 18:41:55 The SNP don't control oil prices. The Saudis flooded the market with cheap oil in an attempt to shut down US fracking - that's why the price dropped.

As for Spain - really? Only today they said they would NOT veto indy Scotland joining the EU.
4708 2018-11-20 18:41:54 Cruelty free shoes and coconut oil! A great pairing. I use coconut oil all the time, I even make face cream and natural soap with it.
4709 2018-11-20 18:41:53 Please don't forget to get our 50% share of Northern Oil and 25% all BP profits from the investment agreements the Iranian dictator Shah screwed us with?! Maybe give it back to the British?! or no wait to Russia! yes yes...give it to Russia, Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Mulla-Kids!

4721 2018-11-20 18:40:53 So EU wants its own army, and its own energy policy and independence from U.S. controlled oil, which is the foundation for that. At the same time it's not shying away from weakening N. African countries, and preparing to expand the EU borders beyond them.
4722 2018-11-20 18:40:50 It would be a much happier healthier world if we no longer needed oil for so many reasons. Wind + solar power are the way to go. 
4723 2018-11-20 18:40:49 Okay ! Well it may have been the soap for me as well !! Ima try that and tea tree oil and see if I like it !!

4727 2018-11-20 18:40:37 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4728 2018-11-20 18:40:37 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4729 2018-11-20 18:40:36 It’s oil. He has no idea how to handle our economy if they mess with our oil supply. Can’t stand Trump, I don’t think anyone knows what to do with our energy situation.

4731 2018-11-20 18:40:31 Oil down 7%. take it easy. Trump just said USA do not change anything in the relationship with Saudis. Trump want low oil prices...

4736 2018-11-20 18:40:20 To combat the streaky what I do is put on a layer of lip balm... something not too heavy (more oil, less wax) &let it sit for about 5 min (so I usually do it before the rest of my face) then put the lip ink on.  It's still a bit streaky, but I find it blends with more lip balm
4737 2018-11-20 18:40:17 Maybe it's the oil 
4738 2018-11-20 18:40:17 Fixed your tweet > Given the amount of oil we send to the U.S., I worry about the precedence! Who knows what Justin Trudeau will be tempted to pull off!

4740 2018-11-20 18:40:13 Wow! As usual, it is all about oil. I am sure the Kochs approve of choosing oil over human rights. Trump just gave permission to murder to any country that has something he wants. I am sick, as anyone with a heart or consience should be. Trump has neither. #SociopathInChief

4758 2018-11-20 18:38:48 I put an oil burner on w/ about 5 drops each of Tea tree oil & Clove oil & water in. I'm amazed at how much it helps me breathe.
4759 2018-11-20 18:38:46 no american president in my lifetime would act any differently...
this is part of the job and every single US president carried it out.
US will never call out Saudi. it’s not called strategic oil for nothing
4760 2018-11-20 18:38:42 Donald Trump is leading a merciless crusade against the oil price and hurting U.S. oil and gas, but this will backfire in his face sooner then later, probably months. As for Saudi Arabia, these types of oil prices lead to revolts and chaos in oil producing nations. It wont last.
4761 2018-11-20 18:38:39 @connellmcshane High Frequency trading is the best thing for retail investors. The markets have been in trouble since Russell broke had nothing to do with trade. Oil is going into the 40's. We can blame whatever we want for the selling, the bottom line is debt is the issue

4813 2018-11-20 18:35:46 Yes I channel check many x's daily. There have been a few offerings (plain pckging, LBS, DNA etc) in the bud section but yet to see a single oil, capsule or pre roll. I know pre rolls will be "rolled" out shortly.  Just can't understand where there massive inventory was deployed.
4814 2018-11-20 18:35:46 The seas are awash with plastic trash.
What to do about it!?
There IS a boat used to pick up oil spills, called a 'slick licker'.
Pick up the plastic, melt it, and form bricks.
New 'forever' building bricks. 
Make houses with it;  save trees. Easy, eh!
4815 2018-11-20 18:35:46 America will go after those that murder its residents and citizens..... that is unless you are black, or you're killed by an oil producing nation. In which case the leader supreme will suck their balls and say unfortunately we are good friends.... #WorstPresidentEver

4830 2018-11-20 18:34:49 With oil price collapsing like this I fully expect contagion to broader markets. Remember transmission mechanisms include high yield debt (energy related bonds  20% of that market), energy company earnings and recession in US oil production #spy #xle #jnk #hyg
4831 2018-11-20 18:34:37 Clove oil really works for tooth pain. Damn I love nature.
4832 2018-11-20 18:34:37 This statement is revolting.  And creepy with the !! all over the place.  Parsed down basically it says "who knows? but we like the oil. America First!"
4833 2018-11-20 18:34:21 There is no need to escalate any conflict with Russia just ask your American/ Arab friends to drop the prise for the oil/gas & Russia will end as USSR. Do research: Oil price and the end of USSR.  `production of battery cells` = WTF? That is a batshit not an ammunition agaist RU.
4834 2018-11-20 18:34:20 Rauchpaprika oder geräucherte Paprika auf Deutsch oder smoked paprika auf Englisch. Gibt es leider nicht in jedem Supermarkt, aber einige haben sie. Oder auch so Läden wie Oil & Vinegar glaube ich.
4835 2018-11-20 18:34:11 Another reason why we should not deal with the Saudis.... Don't sell them another bullet and never buy another drop of oil from them.
4836 2018-11-20 18:34:00 334
4837 2018-11-20 18:33:57 Yeah, it is a tricky one now to read, with market crashing then low oil, but Iran has been a top priority since beginning and continued WH support for MBS appears to tick to Iran coalition.

4845 2018-11-20 18:33:24 To change the oil in his 1972 Pinto?? #OilChange
4846 2018-11-20 18:33:23 just get the saudis to give some oil money into the club. that would work mate.
4847 2018-11-20 18:33:21 What a blatant hypocrisy. There are no #US "national security interests" other than oil and weapons deals. Remember that the #EU (say, the rest of #NATO) does not really support the standpoints and interference of the #US in the #MiddleEast.
4848 2018-11-20 18:33:16 I use  
- milk ( a cup )
- Tumeric ( 1 tablespoon )
- ground up ginger ( 1/4 tsp )
- ground up cinnamon (1/4 tsp)
- honey of some kind
- Black pepper 
- coconut oil 1 tsp
All over simmering milk in a pot ! 
It’s suppose to be good for your immune system & liver.
4849 2018-11-20 18:33:11 Oil getting murdered today, and the  "experts" telling everyone to follow the bullish options activity 
4850 2018-11-20 18:33:05 So, the economy soared and the oil shortage and Iranian hostage crises didn’t really happen? 1% Econ growth under Obama was “soaring”? We weren’t really at war for his entire Presidency? You’re literally delusional.
4851 2018-11-20 18:33:02 So now we align with murderers.
Because... money
what is that line that AFTER the US, SA is the largest oil producer???
There are more lies in that statement ... I am disgusted.
This is the kind of person I would never associate with in my life.. he in no way represents my values
4852 2018-11-20 18:32:58 @SiobhanCoadyNL "possibility of mobilizing a clean up effort" ? Should that not be mandatory and paid for by the oil company ? #nlpoli
4853 2018-11-20 18:32:57 We've been warning about this for years. It's virtually impossible to get any wording into the Constitution to protect the water itself as that would screw the govt's giveaway of our oil, gas, metals, minerals etc which they've been giving away for decades. @JamesQ91239374
4854 2018-11-20 18:32:49 It basically does all the things like healing pain, calming anxiy and everything else without the head high. Like I can’t smoke weed but I take CBD oil to give me all the other healing effects of it
4855 2018-11-20 18:32:46 He’s the kind of guy who will be out of there before they fully understand he’s a fraud. Snake oil salesman.

4858 2018-11-20 18:32:37 Simple. He knows from history that gas prices will go up and his support may drop to zero. I blame the US gov for not getting us off oil two decades ago. They started to try in the 70s and then went backwards.

4870 2018-11-20 18:32:05 That's an understatement: much of the improvement in manufacturaing under Trump was the result of spillover effects of investment in oil/gas, as prices recovered from the 2015/6 crash.

4888 2018-11-20 18:31:08 2/2 Oil is still dropping as the Saudis are over producing and that is a huge factor, they know that Trump is weak and won't acquiesce to his calls for lower production. Add in the fact that the US is piling up debt like crazy and it becomes an unsettled market.
4889 2018-11-20 18:31:08 I was one of them, I think his true punishment however is to pump more oil

4892 2018-11-20 18:30:58 Of course not. Trump has too much personal wealth tied up in Saudi oil. Expected this.
4893 2018-11-20 18:30:51 FWIW, his tweets telling Saudi/Opec to pump more generally came out when gasoline prices in US got to around $3/gal (which was correlating w $80/bbl oil)

4896 2018-11-20 18:30:43 US oil producers would definitey be happier with higher prices. And it could well employ a lot more people in depressed areas. But that’s not the president’s priority..

Also fascinating to see how Russia also has responded to much lower global prices....

4898 2018-11-20 18:30:39 but your administration with trickery destroyed USA oil producers viability.  Now they are looking money and giving the worst holiday seasons to investors..  What kind of administration is that? You even think China will convert from communism to USA capitalism?

4918 2018-11-20 18:29:33 Oil not highly correlated to CPI like the '70's.  Long bond is just one of multiple indicators saying that forward inflation is not one of our problems.  Fed inflation numbers are all in the past.
4919 2018-11-20 18:29:30 "Oil prices plunge 7% as Trump says hell stick by Saudis after #Khashoggi killing" is a terrible headline and an indictment on our society as a whole.

4934 2018-11-20 18:28:55 If the US has become oil independent, and the WTI crude is around $50.00 a barrel, or around $1.20 /gal, why are gasoline prices of Regular at $3.00 / gal. Are the US oil companies selling our oil in the world market, instead of lowering our gasoline prices at home?
4935 2018-11-20 18:28:51 Should there even be a debate about the oil spill? 
"What are you doing about the oil spill?"
"Everything in our power until it's made right."

4984 2018-11-20 18:26:01 Actually, humans need omega 3 oils more than omega 6.  If people eat a lot of omega 6 and little omega 3 oil, bad things start happening to their body like developing depression and down regulation of sex hormones.

4998 2018-11-20 18:25:24 Top of list to buy post TAX LOSS selling - CDN heavy OIL/GAS companies over a billion dollar MC. Stay away from small caps! #nomagicbullet #illbuythedip
4999 2018-11-20 18:25:18 Sanctions will hurt the USA more cause Saudi will just decrease oil production and drive the price up in anger
5000 2018-11-20 18:25:17 In @RampCapitalLLC terms, Oil is Rekt
5001 2018-11-20 18:25:01 Well, that’ll learn me for getting distracted. I was looking to short oil at 14:45 but didn’t keep an eye on it. Would be 350 points up if ot was still open. Still, got a nice 23point short on EURUSD earlier.
5002 2018-11-20 18:25:00 onions lettuce tomato oil vinegar and spice #JMSweepstakes
5003 2018-11-20 18:25:00 IMO, this big down move in #oil is dragging the markets down. Markets attempted to turn, but with oil down as much as it is, too much weight.
5004 2018-11-20 18:24:53 They are the biggest human rights abusers. This isn't surprising. 

They also have the world by the legs with oil. 
So it's not smart to try and piss them off when they could raise the oil prices...
5005 2018-11-20 18:24:51 "Ethical oil" is catchphrase for buying oil from the good guys. We're the good guys. How is that silly?
5006 2018-11-20 18:24:43 She's my friend
5007 2018-11-20 18:24:38 Oil you say?

5010 2018-11-20 18:24:32 Can't wait for this Thursday when the whole family gathers around the hot tub to fill it with 40 gallons of peanut oil and deep fry an entire live elk.
5011 2018-11-20 18:24:29 But only stupid people pay taxes! The magical budget fairy pays for everything- well, except education for all, healthcare for all, housing for all, clean air/water for all, etc. We can’t afford that!!! Now, here’s a bomb and some guns for all. And some wars. And some oil. Yay.
5012 2018-11-20 18:24:29 oil gets in a crouch.....
5013 2018-11-20 18:24:26 Random question, do they have oil in a syringe you can buy or is it only in pre-filled cartridges?
5014 2018-11-20 18:24:24 "Levant's silly ethical oil argument?". You should never have been elected premier of an oil producing province! You have ruined Alberta in more ways than one!  How do people like you live with yourselves!  You will be bye bye real soon!

5018 2018-11-20 18:24:17 Them boys run OPEC and sell us mad oil
5019 2018-11-20 18:24:15 Americans use 12 million barrels worth of oil worth on plastic bags every year, creating 100 billion bags. It requires roughly 14 bags worth of oil to drive 1 mile. Reuse your bags

5021 2018-11-20 18:24:11 Yup. I usually do it for a couple hrs, but overnight is better. I lightly press the peeps in the sugar but you don't have to. The sugar pulls wonderful aromatic oil from the peels.
5022 2018-11-20 18:24:11 #natgas oil markets and weather taking this down.
5023 2018-11-20 18:24:02 The way oil is collapsing seems like global economies are in a deep depression :)
5024 2018-11-20 18:24:01 Saudi Arabia, a nation dependent on oil (and threatened by the shift towards alternatives) has a stronger hand than the United States? Really? In what Amazon Prime alternate universe?
5025 2018-11-20 18:23:59 You sound jealous. You must be Clark Hunt’s nephew or something? Worried there won’t be enough oil monies for you?
5026 2018-11-20 18:23:58 I sometimes marvel at how fellow  westerners think they did something to get oil. Just a Geographic occurance. 

Saudi Kingdom won the lottery in a sand pile.
5027 2018-11-20 18:23:54 えー、うそー！！
5028 2018-11-20 18:23:41 Depends on how you do it. I do boiled bacon but its boiled in a broth of maple extract, teriyaki, soy sauce, sesame oil, and maggi's seasoning. It's own grease gets cooked in aswell and it some of the most flavorful bacon you'd ever taste
5029 2018-11-20 18:23:39 So my radio unit is currently kaput, I need 2 new tyres, I've got too much oil in my engine, I've got an oil leak (surprise), my window washer is split and something related to my exhaust is corroded and Im now without my car - another fun day! 
5030 2018-11-20 18:23:36 قصدك ايه
5031 2018-11-20 18:23:34 because KSA does not need to pander to some foreign body as it one of the largest oil producers and can buy all the awards it wants, UN gave environmentalists awards to seven persons around the world who have no clue, don’t even know how a cloud forms, it’s just gimmicks,  imo
5032 2018-11-20 18:23:33 Nah... I don't think it's *that* simple.
I'm convinced he's ok with it because the Saudi's give HIM money. Not the US, not by keeping oil low, but him - directly.
5033 2018-11-20 18:23:26 Oil in the 40's a real possibility here.
The irony is that the same people who votes for Trump just got the worst part of the deal. How do multiple 7% swings to the downside help the shale boom. Kudlow & Trump definitely two of the three stooges. Still haven't decided on the 3rd.
5034 2018-11-20 18:23:22 I think you overestimate him. You're right about his brain being stuck in 1974 but the rest of it requires too many logical steps before you get to the "Trump" part. Saudis > oil prices > recession > Trump administration. It's more like Saudis rich = Trump rich.
5035 2018-11-20 18:23:17 Umm, ya lost me there cupcake. You’re mad at PMJT for saying he’s phasing out the oil sands. I point out it was PMSH who said that. You claim you made it up but that great minds think alike. So it’s a great statement if you or SH say it. But not when you thought it wa JT?????????
5036 2018-11-20 18:23:16 "We noticed that you need a ne...."

Nigga that car is 3 months old. Stop lying. Change my oil and GO!!

5040 2018-11-20 18:23:00 Ah yes. Where it gets tricky. The big picture w/ Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, that reporter...it revolves around 2 things: power competition & preservation of oil resources. I’m honestly skeptical & confused about th whole ordeal (and everything with the Middle East) as well.

5042 2018-11-20 18:22:54 Time to end Middle East exceptionalism! Leave oil to #freetrade  ... time for Dems to develop a foreign policy breaking with Roosevelt's 1945 deal !! @Ocasio2018  @BernieSanders @SenSanders #HumanRights and #WomensRights  instead of #MiddleEast-exceptionalism !!
5043 2018-11-20 18:22:41 It’s been 3 years since  I had bangs  and  since I am  licensed Cosmetologist I trim only  the split ends and condition ends with oil .  I donated my length 3 times  so  far .
5044 2018-11-20 18:22:38 I think MCT oil really does help my brain work better
5045 2018-11-20 18:22:38 Jesus. Commodities are getting wrecked today. 

Oil is off 7%. The entire GSCI commodity complex is down 4%
5046 2018-11-20 18:22:26 Minha visão vai por aí também...aqui tem notícias "boas" e coisas caminhando para melhor.. exceto... psicológico quando olhamos para fora..Brexit, Oil, Nissan, Trump X China...aí nenguem consegue ter o mínimo de otimismo nem a longo prazo.
5047 2018-11-20 18:22:26 What's so special about Nep's purple boxes that they outvalue 1k oil and certain gold ~~crane~~ eq and 20% refund?
5048 2018-11-20 18:22:23 The funny think about oil prices was all started with a Florida huricane that hit mostly the keys and Texas huricane causing major flooding.  Trump elected lifted all the gates for  oil exploration. But oil still went up Mostly atrificially.   Now major surpluses can't be hidden
5049 2018-11-20 18:22:19 where are all those oil price forecasts now
5050 2018-11-20 18:22:18 I had several friends ask me how to play $100 oil this summer...got the feeling brokers were telling clients it was a sure thing...
5051 2018-11-20 18:22:16 PS: how do you manage to look so handsome always?

Is it some sorta cream, or oil?
5052 2018-11-20 18:22:02 A good oil and spice rubdown, butter under the skin, and a convection oven make the best turkey.

5054 2018-11-20 18:21:52 Algerian Sonatrach, the state's owned oil & gas,  signed a contract with BP & Equinor to explore the S-W basins.

5056 2018-11-20 18:21:42 So let me get this straight. On the way up oil wasn't signalling strong global growth but on the way down it is? Got it.
5057 2018-11-20 18:21:41 Think of her face & voice
Don't u feel like frying Gulneet in deep oil #EndIshqbaaaz if so then let's make the show shut down
5058 2018-11-20 18:21:39 The United States doesn't care when money or oil are involved don't be naive. Every US administration has been complicit with this Brutal Saudi Regime since they found oil in the middle east. Complicit to their Treatment of women,gays and non-muslims . #truth
5059 2018-11-20 18:21:38 basically the gist of the argument is "murders happen all the time Out There for all sorts of reasons or no reason at all, what's one more or less," followed by some bragging about all the great stuff he's done lately, followed by "in conclusion: oil"
5060 2018-11-20 18:21:33 What do we need Saudi Arabia for?   We are the largest oil producer in the world and are now a net exporter.  We need NOTHING from that backwards country.
5061 2018-11-20 18:21:31 So I will use 3500 to buy beard oil.... oga ooh
5062 2018-11-20 18:21:29 Dating a married man is not a problem until you saw your name saved as engine oil

2.£30 billion North sea oil bonanza
3.she cut maintenance grants for the poorest.
4. Reverse public spending cuts.
I could go on.
5064 2018-11-20 18:21:07 You hear about the guy that broke into a fast food restaurant just to eat the frying oil? Used frying oil btw
5065 2018-11-20 18:21:04 toute l incohérence de la gestion de l énergie aujourd hui.. on ne veut plus le charbon , plus de gaz oïl , ni d essence , ,on veut fermer les centrales nucléaires ..On veut garder tout son confort .. comment gérer les contradiction? éoliennes ?
5066 2018-11-20 18:21:02 Yup I got the Jamaican Castor oil and the vitamin one
5067 2018-11-20 18:21:00 Just watched a video of a food blogger and noticed the huge amount of oil and ghee they consume in Punjab. 
5068 2018-11-20 18:20:59 Na iya ruquya idan kuna bukatar service dina
5069 2018-11-20 18:20:57 Saudi Arabia has no compunction on killing, and their royal family thinks they're above everyone. SA killed a US resident. Most of the 9/11 terrorists came from SA. Just because they have oil does not make them an ally. Someone needs to make a stand. Germany is leading the way.
5070 2018-11-20 18:20:57  i need a perm perm olive oil fr
5071 2018-11-20 18:20:53 I mean me personally? I kind of value freedom of speech and human life over oil, but whatever you say man
5072 2018-11-20 18:20:51 Serious question, why can’t we have an Indy Scotland AND still have a tight trade union wae England? Like why dae they have tae control our taxes, resources, oil etc an make our decisions? You wouldny let yer mad Aunty Karen collect yer wages so why do we let they cunts do it???
5073 2018-11-20 18:20:46 They have no morals, they incite and problems to cause these scenes. They are reprehensible and bullies, being used as private security guards for the oil industry. The inspector needs to be reprimanded. If you're going again mate let me know.
5074 2018-11-20 18:20:43 All it takes is oil to grease trump’s small palms.
5075 2018-11-20 18:20:40 taking the inverse here (higher prices) highlights the fault in this logic as it would lead you to believe that Saudi Arabia would then cut production causing ever higher prices & more cuts until they were producing almost nothing (& destroying LT demand for oil in the process).
5076 2018-11-20 18:20:38 Word of advice : if you got a girl ... send her to get ya oil changed , cause i bet she can get changed for cheaper lol..... if she cute
5077 2018-11-20 18:20:37 Fuca. It just said in the oil and gas sector has been down for five minutes, if the language in that regard, and I will be in the 1/4
5078 2018-11-20 18:20:29 Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
5079 2018-11-20 18:20:25 I feel this wollah
5080 2018-11-20 18:20:23 I agree. I'm a proud Scot, always lived here. The SNP tell Scots Westminster /London =England. If we had gained Independence after  Indyref there would have been at least £10 billion 'black hole' in our finances (soon after) under their numbers due to the price of oil  crashing
5081 2018-11-20 18:20:23 Trump praises #SaudiArabia for being "very responsive" to his request to keep "oil prices at reasonable levels" in lengthy, exclamatory-heavy statement on Khashoggi killing. #OOTT
5082 2018-11-20 18:20:18 EXACTLY! When I first went natural it was cool and all and it worked but now? No ma’am. I’ll stick to my extra virgin olive oil and castor oil
5083 2018-11-20 18:20:17 oil <53
5084 2018-11-20 18:20:15 I hope that anointing oil is not as expensive as you are.
5085 2018-11-20 18:20:14 Holy fuck. I sincerely hope you are a highly paid shill and not a genuine dumbfuck.
Look up the history of Procter & Gamble  and what exactly happened the first time they tried to make cottonseed oil edible.
5086 2018-11-20 18:20:12 Just hit the oil pen in the middle of my workout ....
5087 2018-11-20 18:20:12 Hey, we’ve been doing a lot better the last 2 years.  I fear we have peaked based on the decline in oil prices.
5088 2018-11-20 18:20:11 And what happens if there's no other choice? If one company dominates an essential industry, such as Rockefeller controlling the oil industry, then you either buy from them, or you're fucked
5089 2018-11-20 18:20:08 So Civ 6 is adding natural disasters, global warming, climate change AND the world congress is returning. Players who abuse harmful resources (Uranium, Oil, Coal) will affect the world state and cause MORE disasters.

Sounds amazing :D
5090 2018-11-20 18:20:07 Neeee va bio oil???? Jag använder det helaaaa tiden
5091 2018-11-20 18:20:06 US didn’t take oil and gold from Iraq?

5093 2018-11-20 18:20:00 Brent Oil at 62 USD
Good for India but.... Let's see when the world markets get stable
5094 2018-11-20 18:20:00 has been negatively impacted the most by having this lying, cheating, abrasive, antagonistic, untrustworthy snake oil salesman as its appointed figurehead.

#Impeach45
5095 2018-11-20 18:19:57 Oil has some fun today too
5096 2018-11-20 18:19:54 His primary concern is not Israel but jobs, spending with Saudia, steady, reliable oil supply that will not rock the world markets, stability of the regime as not to face chaos  in the region...israel is not his first priority...you seem to be very excitable...
5097 2018-11-20 18:19:51 oil, AAPL, GS never really got going on any futures rally attempt. going to need bids everywhere.

5102 2018-11-20 18:19:39 “and Cheney’s secret dealings with a group of oil and gas executives who were directly influencing national energy policy.”
And, you know, somehow that all just faded away... 
5103 2018-11-20 18:19:28 (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil). RSPO ensures that palm oil comes from sustainable, orangutan friendly places. I hope this helps 2/2 - Mark
5104 2018-11-20 18:19:26 One strategy OPEC+ may take is...to hurt the USA again by pumping hard. Let’s be honest, 90% of OPEC+ don’t like @realDonaldTrump and may give him his death wish. $20 oil to stab the Permian producers again.
5105 2018-11-20 18:19:24 menor se for for o Oil Man, ai ta liberado tu usar regata e sunga
5106 2018-11-20 18:19:23 Hi Balhare, we don't presently have a filter for this, so it does mean looking at the ingredients in most cases I am sorry. I can advise though that  all the palm oil in our own brand products comes from RSPO approved sources 1/2
5107 2018-11-20 18:19:21 I take it teachers in Wales are delighted with their 10% rise. Heres a crazy idea, why don't you back Scotland keeping the oil wealth and no longer contributing to WMDs then we could all get a nice pay rise.
5108 2018-11-20 18:19:07 OK, but the actual most terrifying thing is that he thinks they're controlling oil prices FOR HIS BENEFIT.
5109 2018-11-20 18:19:00 And yes I know olive oil would be better but I'm the only one who ever uses it in this house so of course WE HAVE NONE :D
5110 2018-11-20 18:18:58 oil -7.25% lol
5111 2018-11-20 18:18:56 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
5112 2018-11-20 18:18:52 "The world is a very dangerous place."
Even more so now that @realDonaldTrump endorses murder, if you sell him oil at a discounted rate.
Some scary sht here.

5121 2018-11-20 18:18:21 You obviously know this, but what's really amazing about this is that the US probably has more downside from low oil prices now. Arguably, the oil crash and the ensuing industrial slump made him president!
5122 2018-11-20 18:18:07 He's also admitting to playing dumb because the saudis gave him money and produce oil.
5123 2018-11-20 18:18:06 To the guy changing the oil in my car: you wouldn’t have to quickly fix something you forgot to do if you weren’t so busy hitting on me to pay attention to my car...
5124 2018-11-20 18:18:02 Damn it I bought the wrong hair oil from Sephora.

5126 2018-11-20 18:17:55 Sounds like you need some fried turkey in your life to me...ditch the oven, get some peanut oil and a deep fryer.
5127 2018-11-20 18:17:51 That might be it . It’s funny you commented because I got that coconut oil shit from your snap 
5128 2018-11-20 18:17:49 @realDonaldTrump chicken! Let the House of Saudi get away with murder cos of Oil. It’s not cuck it’s cluck.

5131 2018-11-20 18:17:42 Depends what you fry it in ? Our preference is drench in olive oil then place in the oven  on a low temperature - yummy crisps
5132 2018-11-20 18:17:38 Well I failed my midterm, my cars in the shop for $1000 in repairs due to an oil leak & replacing other parts, & I’m anxious as fuck. How’s your Tuesday going? 
5133 2018-11-20 18:17:37 I think this makes sense, and actually might be true! Economy's doing OK but could be vulnerable to an oil price shock, and his only possible chance of reelection comes with a strong economy
5134 2018-11-20 18:17:36 Oil at 62 USD and looking great for Indian consumers. Markets will suck for a while perhaps...but this is actually good news
5135 2018-11-20 18:17:34 It tasted OK, but it seemed a bit thin. Is soya milk less effective than eggs as a thickener, or was there not enough acidity from the lemon juice? The Hellmann's ingredients list shows about 10% more oil.
5136 2018-11-20 18:17:30 You’ve just got to sweet talk it. And buy it accessories. Like lemon juice and olive oil. And a pass to massage envy. I feel anyone who hasn’t done those things doesn’t deserve kale’s sweet embrace. It takes time. I understand.
5137 2018-11-20 18:17:22 It smells oil
5138 2018-11-20 18:17:20 I can't see how that is down to Iceland. That would be down to the other brands to package their items with 'no palm oil'. Iceland have already done it with theirs. Sadly it will be a case of read the ingredients as usual for us all. X
5139 2018-11-20 18:17:18 Interview today. Add oil. #addoil #Interviews
5140 2018-11-20 18:17:15 Agreed @SarahChampionMP but did enough oil theme speak up in @UKHouseofLords #debate ?
5141 2018-11-20 18:17:12 Geopolitics will always trump (no pun  intended) lives. Oil and arms deals are more important. If bush and Obama did nothing to Saudi Arabia for causing a genocide and supporting terrorists what makes you think the U.S is willing to sacrifice their relationship over one guy?
5142 2018-11-20 18:17:10 "saudi arabia may kill a lot of people, but it also helps a lot of people get oil, so, it;s impossible to say if its bad or not," -President dril
5143 2018-11-20 18:16:47 I'm treating the dry skin and bags in and around and under my eyes with olive oil. I don't know if this an accepted practice, but it seems to be working wonders. Also, the Cetaphil hydrating gel for eyes is really really bad and will mess u up.  #iamprobablydelicious
5144 2018-11-20 18:16:37 Not surprised to see oil price drop further on the news Mr Trump will forgive and forget the Saudi Princes alleged part in the killing of the journalist recently. Just as Saudi had been discussing decreasing output to support the price.
5145 2018-11-20 18:16:33 The 5 must B off the old man's  brain. He is now empty up and down except water belly. How did Nigeria come to have smuggler turn VP wifey and president OBJ dished out oil block for personal VIEW of any passing loose canon. God help NIGERIA.

5147 2018-11-20 18:16:26 They were.  In that time the Bush’s wouldn’t touch them because of their oil and oil money.  They are necessary for those make millions off of Big Oil. Now - because Trump makes money off of them.

5149 2018-11-20 18:16:21 Baby oil!
5150 2018-11-20 18:16:17 Good tip I usually just use baby oil on a cotton swab leave on my eyes for about 10/20seconds gently rub then wash off with makeup remover and it works even pure coconut oil
5151 2018-11-20 18:16:16 You don’t get that oil to market you’ll be writing iou’s
5152 2018-11-20 18:16:14 Its fackking crazy - Oil markets (both Brent and WTI) are down 6%+ in a single day.
5153 2018-11-20 18:16:11 Clean up the oil on top
5154 2018-11-20 18:16:09 My car has been begging me for an oil change and a car wash. I am glad I am able to do this for her today.
5155 2018-11-20 18:16:08 And of course while oil and gas is 22% of their GDP, it is 67% of its exports. But then they were never i  the rush to get it out of the ground we were, their economy was fine before, ours was in the toilet.
5156 2018-11-20 18:16:07 Check your Engine oil this morning.
5157 2018-11-20 18:16:07 What do people really expect him to do; put sanctions on them for them to turn around and cut oil production and jack up the price of gas.
5158 2018-11-20 18:16:06 We go around preaching to countries that don't have oil and don't buy our weapons. Now I get it.
5159 2018-11-20 18:16:04 "We really need their oil and they know it, so we won't do anything to jeopardize that"
5160 2018-11-20 18:16:03 And they contain palm oil. 
5161 2018-11-20 18:16:01 Well sadly Game at Pritchard Street didn't have any of your products on the shelves, clicks at Ellof street don't have all your products,had to go to Pick N pay-Carlton center to get a Marula oil. Such a struggle 
5162 2018-11-20 18:15:55 i use coconut oil religiously
5163 2018-11-20 18:15:55 I think this is exactly what's going on, explicitly so. Quid pro quo: we'll keep oil prices down as long as you publicly absolve us for the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
5164 2018-11-20 18:15:51 Well I know one Oga that can do it fr u without stress, kawai da kachemasa Allah ya maa Dutse da kewayenta an gama, Heir to the throne.
5165 2018-11-20 18:15:51 I love a challenge. Can't think of any immediate reason GF flour wouldn't work for fried chicken; it's not like I'm counting on the gluten to hold the crust's rise. Might have to watch the oil temperature. Sure hope Old Bay's gluten-free though.

5167 2018-11-20 18:15:47 What’s the answer? War? Oil embargo? More troops? Iran kills thousands, Cuba kills people and nothing said. I’m sorry but you go to the Middle East, NKorea at your own risk.

I don't want to be lonely this Christmas - I want to eat with my family. Well done on the palm oil campaign. Right steps. Incredible steps really. Thank you. Ps be vegan kind!
5170 2018-11-20 18:15:32 Today’s @USTreasury action targeting the Russia-Iran oil scheme to prop up Assad, and finance Hizballah & Hamas, sends a clear message: there are grave consequences for anyone shipping oil to Syria, or trying to evade U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s terrorist activities.
5171 2018-11-20 18:15:27 Actually, Donnie, we're the biggest oil producers at the moment. But don't let facts get in the way of your urge to pander.

5176 2018-11-20 18:15:11 I prefer alchemists fire or greek fire oil (depending on addition)... Oil of slipperiness and glue of stickiness are also fun

5184 2018-11-20 18:14:32 It's just so weird, even after two years of this guy, to hear him clearly articulate that an ally's oil and arms deals are more important than one murdered journalist who was a US resident.

5193 2018-11-20 18:13:49 Think @realDonaldTrump has considered the reason the US growth is booming in his “anchor” states is because oil price has boomed? Careful what you wish for in lower oil prices....

5195 2018-11-20 18:13:32 .@SaudiEmbassyUSA Very unfortunate that the jig is up with your "kingdom" & plotting w/ our "president".  Maybe this will finally be the catalyst for the Saudi people to finally rise up against your "king" and bring down the House of Saud. Oh yeah, you ain't the only one with oil
5196 2018-11-20 18:13:30 Climate change does not happen gradually; it is not a smooth curve like in the IPCC report; it is a step function. Similarly, reduction in emissions is not a smooth curve, and the first step is the bankruptcy of a big oil company, like Exxon.
5197 2018-11-20 18:13:27 Duh we want their oil.  That country is all gooned up. Women’s right non existent.
5198 2018-11-20 18:13:27 Former congressman Chris John says he's leaving his leadership position at the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association at the end of the year. He's been president of the lobbying organization for 11 years. #lalege #lagov

5201 2018-11-20 18:13:17 On this one... Trump is saying out loud what has been US policy for last 50 years regardless of leadership (except S/MONEY/OIL)
5202 2018-11-20 18:13:15 You forgot to mention how the US is stealing Syrian oil, whilst using fighting ISIS as a cover for illegal US presence in sovereign nation of #Syria who, with Iran & Russia have been fighting Western-backed terrorists and soon the whole world will know who is the real terrorist.
5203 2018-11-20 18:13:07 Add lime oil to cut out odor.

5207 2018-11-20 18:12:44 Really don’t understand how people are suddenly calling out the palm oil issue. This has been going on for decades and just because of a television advert people suddenly care? There has been thousands of articles and documentaries and no one has stood up. Now because of a -

5209 2018-11-20 18:12:30 FWIW I think Trump is obsequious to Saudi Arabia less because of some financial relationship (though maybe some of that) and more because his brain is stuck in 1974 & he believes their bluster that they could jack up oil prices, throw the US into recession & wreck his presidency.
5210 2018-11-20 18:12:30 Or develop local and domestic supplied from Canadian oil sands and offshore drilling.

5215 2018-11-20 18:12:10 China downturn, trump, Brexit all add up mate and lead to drops, lead by oil over last few weeks and now driven by the techs in US particularly the FAANG 5. Over here we had Beaufort sell down to add to the sell down. All that is why market abuse crews are busy with PoS
5216 2018-11-20 18:12:09 This is unacceptable! But hey, oil, money, and weapons! Plus, they pinky swear they had nothing to do with it! FFS.

5219 2018-11-20 18:12:04 There is hardly anything surprising here (lots of BS), but I do wonder just where Saudi Arabia is going to get all of those hundreds of billions it is supposed to spend in the US. Its oil based economy is already in trouble.

This against a backdrop of Saudi saying they're looking for a +1m b/d cut in output in December

Thank you.

Fed tightening (#QT), trade war fears, fear of recession are tanking the markets. Housing is down, stocks are down, gold is down, oil is down.

5271 2018-11-20 18:09:15 This says we have no moral standard on human rights. It says we will turn a blind eye to immoral acts of other regimes, as long as they support us, provide oil, and buy weapons. Trump’s policy “what can you do for us, and we don’t care what you do to others.”
5272 2018-11-20 18:09:12 Of course Saudi Arabia is our no. 1 arms buyer and oil producer
5273 2018-11-20 18:09:05 b-bu-but you can put some avocado leaves mixed with tea oil on it! Makes it go away instantly!
5274 2018-11-20 18:08:52 "After the US, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels"

Wow I didn't realize oil is worth more than the cost of an American life
5275 2018-11-20 18:08:49 30 to 40 years from now, the oil revenue will come down drastically upon which middle east economy is so heavily dependent and these islamic nations have to decide whether they r going to accept liberal values and survive or dissent into darkness of Sharia.
5276 2018-11-20 18:08:47 Fear-mongering, straight into "Whataboutism", they are bribing us and have us by the balls with their oil, discrediting the CIA, and then "Facts?  What Facts"...  Absolutely Disgraceful.

5280 2018-11-20 18:08:34 So much for not harming the oil and wine.
5281 2018-11-20 18:08:31 Whether we increase or decrease CO2 in the Atmosphere it will make little or no difference to Climate Change - except of course it's a $Trillion Dollar business for the Oil Companies & a tax boon for Government.....that's why they heavily support it

5283 2018-11-20 18:08:16 Am I the only one who saw he went from "safety and security will be the number one thing I consider" to "Saudi Arabia is the second largest oil source"?

Well which is it, is our safety or our oil more important?
5284 2018-11-20 18:08:08 try removing it with coconut oil and a washrag by gently scrubbing it. that usually works for me. but u did come off kinda rudely to james tbh. but i do understand the hives bc i have very sensitive skin myself and have to watch what products i use.

5290 2018-11-20 18:07:39 The era of basing alliances on oil, greed or “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” is over. In the age of the internet our Foreign Policy hypocrisy is there for all to see. 
We need to walk the walk of the talk we talk if we are to regain the global leadership role we once had.

5294 2018-11-20 18:07:27 I think they will do everything they can to keep the oil wells they believe to be theirs. That’s why they are called Nigeria PLC
5295 2018-11-20 18:07:18 It's all well and good everyone boycotting palm oil, but it seems that people don't realise that animal consumption is one of the main causes of deforestation in the rain forest.

5301 2018-11-20 18:06:38 No it isn't Trump only cares about money and his family has done a lot of business with Saudi Arabia. To be fair CNN should acknowledge Barack Obama and George Bush also were reticent to criticize the Saudi regime. They just care about Saudi oil and the money.
5302 2018-11-20 18:06:37 Oil prices are critically low because Canadian producers over-produced for the capacity to move their product. Isn't that about the stupidest thing a business mind could do? Quit pointing the finger at the feds!

5307 2018-11-20 18:06:33 From the WH statement: "After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world." 
So did Mueller eat all of Russia or something?
5308 2018-11-20 18:06:29 The US is an oil and guns nation. Nothing will get in the way of that, not even the murdering of journalists.

5314 2018-11-20 18:06:11 Until we switch to renewable energy, Oil will always dictate U.S. policy, no matter the cost in treasure or blood.
5315 2018-11-20 18:06:07 If this ain’t true... then our leaders should come out and prove it. Ghana  was even doing somehow well with other resources but now that we have discovered crude oil... the country is more messed up and worse than before.. this tell you we have bad leadership and management
5316 2018-11-20 18:06:03 The GDP figures are distorted and have been for years. Exports are attributed to keep our figures down, this is without even looking at oil. 1/2
5317 2018-11-20 18:05:53 suspect Cirelli is on the hot seat too and Katz wouldn't allow a long term contract for a new coach right now. If the Oil miss the playoffs suspect both Cirelli and Hitch are gone and Q will be at the top of the list for the new GM.
5318 2018-11-20 18:05:49 I’m getting my oil changed and a little girl walked up to my chair and kept calling me mommy...I need to go home
5319 2018-11-20 18:05:48 You’ve let me down, @IcelandFoods. Animal Agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation and it is not healthy for our planet. I was impressed by your palm oil video but not by this.
5320 2018-11-20 18:05:35 Going to see if a nice hot oil bath by candlelight with mediation music will ease my aches. #feelingill #letsgetbetter

5323 2018-11-20 18:05:24 Asparagus.  Toss it in a little olive oil, kosher salt and pepper to taste.  Grill it or saute it until fork tender.  Easy
5324 2018-11-20 18:05:21 I exaggerated the situation but opinions and bias can maintain status quo (oil) or distract people long enough to kill things off such as net neutrality.  

Without a base of sanity and integrity in journalism it's difficult to get bearings. That benefits certain groups. Trust.
5325 2018-11-20 18:05:20 can’t believe iceland’s been all about banning palm oil but now they’ve just announced they’re reducing vegan stock over christmas to make way for other stuff (i.e. turkeys) ??? wot do u think is worse for the planet lol

5337 2018-11-20 18:04:31 Shouldn’t you be more concerned about the offshore oil spill of 250,000 litres. May I add “is one of largest in the history of NL industry”. You’ve been tweeting about ‘plastic straws long enough...imo, least culprit of our environment
5338 2018-11-20 18:04:27 #oil sell off seems to be accelerating now - the chart is extraordinary
5339 2018-11-20 18:04:15 I get Drilldown newsltr from iPolitics.  Sigh.  Nordic countries are 100% renewable, so Google opened a call centre.  Next item, seven-meter seas prevents even quantifying oil spill off NL.  But are we using those seas for renewables?  Not with vision of 4 yr stretches!  #pr4bc
5340 2018-11-20 18:04:14 Based on his rejection of our Intelligence Community placing the blame on the Saudi Crown Prince, some people are saying that  @realDonaldTrump must be planning a Trump Tower in Saudi Arabia or their oil money is invested in his hotels.
5341 2018-11-20 18:04:14 Translation: I'm not giving up that sweet, sweet oil money.

5344 2018-11-20 18:04:07 @AOTtrades DXY (USD) is strong, which should continue to hurt oil.  Gold though, it holding up very well and should start a bounce that will move quickly to the up side IMHO.
5345 2018-11-20 18:04:04 He doesn’t care who dies just the oil money unbelievable
5346 2018-11-20 18:04:03 We need oil. He’s dead.

5348 2018-11-20 18:04:01 Ultimately you are correct, its not my business, but i do not want my country supporting leaders of MBS's caliber.  We dont need allies like MBS or SA's oil.
5349 2018-11-20 18:03:56 Trump is a traitor to our American Values - for oil and for not encouraging new sources of energy; very short sighted
5350 2018-11-20 18:03:56 With all due respect Mr. Premier there were some 250,000 litres of oil spilled, that sir is no longer in the ground and must have some affect on revenue.  #nlpoli

5354 2018-11-20 18:03:26 Two countries finance terrorism more than any other two countries combined: Iran and Saudi Arabia.  So how many barrels of petroleum are in the budget for terrorism, yes, it's a line item budget  number based on oil revenue.

Give us your wise words oh great one 

Speak up Adler. What should he do 

Maybe blowing up the Middle East and starting an oil crisis is better ? 

All the world should condemn the Saudis without question. Also not a US citizen.
5359 2018-11-20 18:03:06 “Saudi Arabia did a bad thing, but oil”. 
5360 2018-11-20 18:03:04 Refinery of "Crude oil" need electricity too right? So?.....
5361 2018-11-20 18:02:55 I kinda dig this.. but I just take olive and tea tree oil and mix it with my own shit
5362 2018-11-20 18:02:50 Every single president is weak when it comes to Saudi Arabia. That sweet sweet oil sure tastes good.
5363 2018-11-20 18:02:45 Fairy liquid same as oil spill  birds I think
5364 2018-11-20 18:02:43 Not really anymore. We are pretty much energy independent and we only get 9% of Saudi oil which we really don't need.  Canada/Mexico could pick up that 9% and we wouldn't need them at all.
5365 2018-11-20 18:02:42 Translation: My relationship is with Saudi Arabia, the oil, and the money. Nothing else matters.
5366 2018-11-20 18:02:38 WH and KSA must have talked, KSA complained that WH screwed them on sanction waivers adjustment, WH potentially fixing narrative problem while maintaining support for MBS, what will be KSA’s favor? Question ultimately for WH is oil price more important than Iran. #crude #WTI
5367 2018-11-20 18:02:34 Yeah, they may have killed him, but then again they produce oil, so... -- Donald Trump, the leader of the free world
5368 2018-11-20 18:02:30 Incredible. Perhaps if “reasonable oil prices” weren’t so important for the world, we wouldn’t be in half as big a mess as we are.

5371 2018-11-20 18:02:17 I do not think this was an ill advised decision. But it may come with a price for SA: the end of the Yemeni war. (Do you realize that Yemen has new oil fields? Why should SA get it?)

5381 2018-11-20 18:01:29 @realDonaldTrump Listen Goldilocks Without Pakistan The USA will not be able to fight terrorism. Can the USA explain what did they find by attacking Afghanistan and Libya to date neither USA or UK have explained the attacks on these 2 countries expect for oil and gold looted

5384 2018-11-20 18:01:22 It's time to revisit NGW & EE replacement project applications. Lessons learned along with adoption of best practices & new technologies make such projects extremely attractive both fiscally & environmentally. 

Time to expand Oilsands-Heavy Oil production with tidewater access.
5385 2018-11-20 18:01:13 It's a free pass for MBS - and any other leader who does significant business with the US or pumps oil - to kill again.
5386 2018-11-20 18:01:09 By that, he means he’ll buy more oil and raise their rent .00000001%
5387 2018-11-20 18:01:03 You keep pissing off @SaudiEmbassyUSA with @CIA Kashoggii Bull Shit on MBS and the Saudis will negotiate with @KremlinRussia_E on oil leaving out Iran! @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse

Then we prefer support a foreign economy.

Stiff Canadian consumers with overpriced dairy, and stiff Canadian oil families by making it impossible for them to do business.
5391 2018-11-20 18:00:56 @realDonaldTrump is essentially telling the Saudis, very publicly, “I want to see that $450 bn contract signed/executed and I want you to contain oil prices, then we remain allies, otherwise ...”

5396 2018-11-20 18:00:20 Has blown piston rings. I didn't catch it when I bought it because he just did a fresh oil change as a "bonus". But 2 weeks after I bought it my oil pressure light came on. So I changed it and only got about a quart out of a 5 qt engine. I was hoping it was a fluke

5400 2018-11-20 18:00:06 I am blown away (not really though) that oil is still the strongest force when it comes to diplomacy and defense. It is 2018- China will pass us up with renewable energy in 3 years. Remember when that mattered on who was a leader in innovation? We are now a leader in corruption!
5401 2018-11-20 18:00:04 The the oil price tanked is quite interesting (to be fair, we were happy with $60 at the beginning of the year)
5402 2018-11-20 18:00:02 Oil markets seem to think MBS is under Trump's thumb and will forego hundreds of billions in oil revenue in order for continued US support.
5403 2018-11-20 18:00:01 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
5404 2018-11-20 18:00:01 I think @Jacob_Rees_Mogg idea of releasing a Palm Oil cookbook is probably another bad move by him.

5407 2018-11-20 17:59:39 I’m not sure how to answer this questions as your fundamental premise that vegetable oil is somehow different from other oils doesn’t agree with my reality.
5408 2018-11-20 17:59:37 Americans Canadians Realise we are Being Screwed Blued Tatooed By oil companies And old NWO GLOBAL ELITES ARE ZIONISTS not for long We are giving them more Rope before all Owls are CAGED For Good Never Getting Out Some Even Worse Truth Chairs Working Amazing Catch&Release For Now
5409 2018-11-20 17:59:30 So Saudi Arabia, running huge deficits (and with enormous promised spending commitments) is going to cut production, with oil prices down 30%? With US shale producers happy to fill their void?
5410 2018-11-20 17:59:24 @OilGasCanada should simply reduce production if the industry is concerned about the low price of oil. It's simple economics. Wait until the market gives you a better price. I doubt that having 3 advisers to tell you this is necessary. @RachelNotley @albertaNDP
5411 2018-11-20 17:59:23 Just listening to @CNBC today. Yesterday an oil and gas guy came on and said we’re at the bottom now. Oil is on its way back up. Low & behold oil is down 5% today! Another oil guy today says “Yep this is a bottom”. Translation SELL because these “experts” don’t have a clue!

5418 2018-11-20 17:58:52 How much of Nigeria's problems over the last 3 years is directly related to crash in oil prices (not within govt control) and failure to prepare for it (courtesy of the last admin)?

How the residual are perhaps due to governance failure.
5419 2018-11-20 17:58:37 #BREAKING: Iran and Saudi Arabia were defined as we know them in the 1930s and when their oil is useless everyone will go back to not giving a fuck about them.

5422 2018-11-20 17:58:16 Depends what I’m making but typically olive oil or grapeseed or canola. I don’t know what “toxic veg oil” is though. It’s oil and can come from a wide range of sources, none of them toxic.

5424 2018-11-20 17:58:09 The only question I have is why. Is it due to business relationships with the Saudis and Trump? The very screwed up relationship between the U.S. and Saudi governments? Or is it just tied to oil?

Wow..Yayy Murder away..As long as you have oil though and money..
5433 2018-11-20 17:57:35 And who checks that the oil where the oil comes from?  Are there safeguards to prevent manipulation of the supply chain?

5435 2018-11-20 17:57:33 The new model Ford ran on water alone - some said it was the greatest invention of the ages. The planet would surely be saved. Oil was redundant.

Little did they know then that in a thousand years the planet would run out of water.

5436 2018-11-20 17:57:32 You guys went out on a high note, if you ask me. Lots of fun, and plenty of much-needed calling out. Shame you had the very definition of an oil painting for an audience.
5437 2018-11-20 17:57:21 No women picking up trash. Working on oil rigs, building houses. Road construction, landscaping the list goes on and on. And if your wife cheats on you and files divorce she still gets the kids, the house, and half of your income. Equal needs to become equitable.

5443 2018-11-20 17:56:53 Don't miss out on the mixing of US national security - and Saudi oil production - in the last paragraph. @realDonaldTrump is clearly articulating that Saudi's ability and willingness to pump oil is more important than stopping them from murdering people outside their borders

5445 2018-11-20 17:56:48 I think you're missing the point,  until we no longer need their oil  and their influence in the region... We're stuck with the "devil you know". This has persisted under the last 11 administrations... 45's history with them... while dirty, has little to do with geo-politics.
5446 2018-11-20 17:56:39 “They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels”

 It was always about the money and never about human life or the truth. At least be honest about it. (And for goodness sake, stop using so many “!!!”)
5447 2018-11-20 17:56:38 So is there a direct supply chain from the sustainable growers to the manufacturers or does it all get mixed in with the non-sustainable oil?  I.e does the specific oil produced end up in specific products and with end to end transparency?
5448 2018-11-20 17:56:33 Greatest achievement?  Easy. Conning the crap out of Tory Party members, his constituents and Leave voters. He’d do really well in the snake oil industry if he put his mind to it.
5449 2018-11-20 17:56:19 Noticeably colder and the oil and coal are starting to go down at an increased rate, so will need deliveries of both very soon. A bit wet at the moment. 
It is now getting cold enough to get the candles out and if it gets much colder I might have to light them!

Its despicable
5453 2018-11-20 17:56:04 stop subsidies to the very profitable fossil fuel industry.
get fossil fuel consumers to pay the true cost of burning oil: healthcare and climate change. to date, burning fossil fuel is subsidized.
5454 2018-11-20 17:56:04 BREAKING !! I can confirm #PresidentTrumpt just stated he is aware Saudi Ruler Prince Salman probably knew about the murder of journalist #Khashoggi BUT 
1. Saudi is investing nearly half a billion in USA (= 10s of 1000s of jobs)+ agreed to keep pumping Oil (=lower US Gas prices)

Same strategy & similar deals with US cos to help cut taxes & help profit them

5534 2018-11-20 17:50:04 Hmm.. Jgan berfalsafah lak. Saya sek. FROM3 aja.. Lain Ler U oil semua..
5535 2018-11-20 17:50:02 With oil prices down more than 5% today, President Trump is getting what he asked for. 

But the drop isn't good news for the entire U.S., especially shale oil-producing states of Texas, North Dakota and others that rely on the #oil industry for a huge chunk of their GDPs.

5536 2018-11-20 17:49:53 So, why exactly are we so cozy with the country that spawned Bin Laden,  nearly all of the 911 perpetrators and the exporters of the most virulent strain of Wahabist Islam?
#SaudiArabia  Never understood that...except for oil.
5537 2018-11-20 17:49:52 When you’re eating a sub and the mixtures from the mayo, oil, & vinegar drips on your pinky and slurp that shit up 
5538 2018-11-20 17:49:46 Far enough into Kansas to see the little oil rigs out in the fields 
5539 2018-11-20 17:49:42 Good for you. Check how the estimation is made for food and drink (excluding whisky). Check for the mysterious 5th region of the UK through which oil and gas is funnelled. Check for the disproportionate allocation of costs.
5540 2018-11-20 17:49:41 you'd think the government would want the oil sands to recover oil faster.  the sands are a natural oil spill and the mining is merely a recovery and environmental clean up.  it is slowly evaporating and leaking into the waterways.  that's how they knew there was oil there.

5545 2018-11-20 17:49:04 Canadian dollar is fighting it. It wants to ignore oil again lol.

Yeah let's pretend it has no effect on the oil sands.

Serious intervention

5546 2018-11-20 17:49:00 Greenpeace are a group of activates that have no political leaning just trying to save the world from the bad practices of businesses  Iceland are telling us palm oil is destructive to man and beasts
5547 2018-11-20 17:48:54 So i read they are taking oil licences off most of our LOCs without any reasons yet.... Who is going to operate those wells?
5548 2018-11-20 17:48:53 He literally argued with a couple people in our class that the world’s oil supply will never run out
5549 2018-11-20 17:48:51 Illegally occupy the oil producing regions of your country and then sanction you for importing oil... Seems reasonable 
5550 2018-11-20 17:48:46 Any Black Friday sales on oil changes?

5555 2018-11-20 17:48:33 If you are using sustainable palm oil it would be helpful to label your products as such to avoid confusion.

5558 2018-11-20 17:48:28 Got this insane oud oil from DBX for a friend but she has refused to collect it

5559 2018-11-20 17:48:16 This latest keech on oil, that somehow an iScotland can’t benefit from it cause, you know, global warming, an aw that, neglects to mention that there’s no chance in hell WM won’t pump fields dry as fast as it can, nor that an iScotland could extract >10 slower and be no worse off

5564 2018-11-20 17:47:53 Goons  @ NY Fed along with their friends hitting #Oil to save the economy from the damage of higher rates & crushing debt. It won't work, but what it will do is ensure much higher #oil prices in the future. I guess we already know that Central Banks don't think about the future.

oh finally Ginger is calling the shot! He wants to be part of the cartel.... fianlly he had the gut to say it
5568 2018-11-20 17:47:26 Best trades for 2019 will be long bonds and short oil. That is the setup I think. @RaoulGMI and resulting decrease in oil capex in the US could lead to even tighter conditions and possibly a recession
5569 2018-11-20 17:47:23 No way... Donald sided with a rich oil prince who pays him tons of money for his hotels over his own intelligence agency report... shocker there.
5570 2018-11-20 17:47:15 the Oil have really sucked
  for a really long time...
despite winning the draft lottery in 2010, '11, '12 $ '15
(a luxury the #Flames have NEVER had, even in Atlanta)

I'm sure a coaching change'll make a world of difference, though 

Go Flames!

5571 2018-11-20 17:46:48 No sweetie the wars of the past have been about oil.  Even the CIA admits it.
5572 2018-11-20 17:46:48 Anyone ken any good remedies to get rid of milia? I've heard tea tree oil is good so I'll try that first but if anyone has any actual advice that would be swell.

5575 2018-11-20 17:46:35 Make sure u lube em up before u try to put them in, double flair plugs are typically impossible to get in without some lotion or oil..... I still do this with my plugs and I’ve been at this size for years!!
5576 2018-11-20 17:46:31 Really?  You're saying we never went to war to protect our access to oil? Then why did we overturn Iran's democratically elected leader again?  You seem to be in serious need of a history lesson.
5577 2018-11-20 17:46:29 I bought it last week and as a fan of indomie, i can tell you its a sore disappointment. For cryinng out loud, the sauce has palm oil!!!!!
5578 2018-11-20 17:46:18 Donald J Trump on video (pre POTUS)

- "If given the opportunity I would take the oil from Iran, not the people, just the oil"

Most likely deleted from Youtube now.

He has hated Iran for decades, this is personal.

5580 2018-11-20 17:46:09 Translation: My relationship is with Saudi Arabia, the oil, and the money. Nothing else matters.
5581 2018-11-20 17:46:07 $SPY i can tell you right now: S&P will bounce, dollar will pull back, oil will bounce higher, gold will go lower, bitcoin will go below 3k.
5582 2018-11-20 17:45:53 Less hot showers, moisturize SOON as you get out the shower while your pores are open, and no scented stuff cuz it has alcohol in it and that dries ya skin out. Shea butter, coconut oil, or cocoa butter sis
5583 2018-11-20 17:45:48 The core of my thesis is with housing inventory high and oil lower, investment is almost certainly going to be down, and inflation will be soft, maybe take a couple months to really show up in the data
5584 2018-11-20 17:45:47 Of course they should

Saudi is a G20 economy, with the largest oil reserves and production capacity in the world.

5586 2018-11-20 17:45:32 it was never 45 anyway... 44.7 was the best they could muster and that on the back of lies and oil paying for everything...
5587 2018-11-20 17:45:27 I can't eat galaxy chocolate anymore, it's got palm oil in. I'm heartbroken

5590 2018-11-20 17:45:22 Deep-fried turkey isn't higher in fat than a roasted bird if you make sure that the oil is at a high temperature before frying (usually 375 to 400 degrees F, depending on the fryer). If the temp is too low the oil will saturate the meat making it greasy & increasing fat content.
5591 2018-11-20 17:45:14 I'd be more inclined to save the duck fat for savory projects, and use refined coconut oil instead.
5592 2018-11-20 17:45:11 Looking at the schedule, we have a few openings for this week...do you need an alignment? Brakes? Check engine light? Front end work? Tires? Air conditioner work? Oil Change? Tire rotation? We can help! Give us a call! 785-336-2828

5595 2018-11-20 17:44:55 The $450b number is a lie - please label it as so. The Kingdom needs us way more than we need them. We are net exporters of oil and have the refineries for gasoline. This is just doubling down on a bad hand an more chronic inability to admit a mistake
5596 2018-11-20 17:44:50 Conspiracy theory did Saudis kill reporter as attempt to raise oil prices .  Trump seems to be duking them by no sanctions . .  What's next remember 911 raise oil prices higher than ever Saudis backed Terrorist seem to help drive oil prices back up using  religion as a accuse .
5597 2018-11-20 17:44:44 Oil ! Exports ? £100 million from @BBCScotland .

5607 2018-11-20 17:43:55 So Turkey worked with ISIS marketing their oil and letting their agents travel in and out of Syria. But if you call them terrorist for this, you get banned on facebook.
5608 2018-11-20 17:43:45 Oil refineries, slaughterhouses, chemical factories... 

Regular offices, retail, light industry should definitely be intermixed with residential.
5609 2018-11-20 17:43:43 what’s the protocol for when the guy who changed your oil yesterday is the only other person in a hole in the wall mexican restaurant with you?

5614 2018-11-20 17:43:29 Lmao the dude in my environmental Policy class who thinks oil is a renewable resource showed up for the first time in like a month and a half for a group exercise we did in class and his entire team wanted to kill him
5615 2018-11-20 17:43:05 So, in short, killing Kashoggi was bad, but Saudi Arabia provides so much of that sweet sweet oil (which is all about putting "America First"), because America in 2018 has the values of a mafia crime family.
5616 2018-11-20 17:43:02 Surprising Trump wants lower oil,  will screw US shale
5617 2018-11-20 17:42:58 #Oil down another 5% today.. this is a free fall! #Trump played it very well!
5618 2018-11-20 17:42:56 I find it fascinating that @business ' #brexit coverage appears to be sponsored by Exxon, and is prefaced with an ad for Exxon. 

I mean, we all know Big Oil has involved itself in politics for decades, but this is rather more blatant than usual
5619 2018-11-20 17:42:55 Also I don't trust a mac & cheese dish that doesn't have some oil separation going on.
5620 2018-11-20 17:42:45 Sounds like Popeye ‘s girlfriend Olive Oil
5621 2018-11-20 17:42:43 I make mostly natural products. Most with essential oils and some with synthetic fragrances. Right now I have bar soaps, facial toners, face scrub and mask, facial moisturizer, virgin coconut oil, body oils, body scrubs and Jamaican black castor oil.
5622 2018-11-20 17:42:37 one reason going back before both Bush’s: oil and big weapons purchases ( and it you tell people the sky MAY be green instead of blue enough times they will start to doubt its color)

5626 2018-11-20 17:42:11 Hi, Frangipani Monoi Body Oil has a coconut oil base which causes it to solidify in cooler temperatures. We’d recommend placing the bottle under a warm/ hot tap before use to melt it back to its oil form. It should melt with the heat. I hope this helps!
5627 2018-11-20 17:42:09 (っ＾天＾ｃ)
5628 2018-11-20 17:42:02 Oil Change should be done regularly indeed, every few seasons rinse and repeat 
5629 2018-11-20 17:41:57 Honestly man I noticed for me a huge part was diet. Eating more portion sizes & healthier foods/snacks.

Also here are some things I take with some food to start my day:
- Fish Oil
- Bacopa
- Vitamin B
- Ashwagandha Powder mixed with my tea/Coffee

Txt me if u got any questions
5630 2018-11-20 17:41:54 It’s #TriviaTuesday! Between 2013-2017, how many products using cold pressed oil (as an ingredient) were launched across the globe?
5631 2018-11-20 17:41:54 I need more oil!  It's a little dry
5632 2018-11-20 17:41:53 What's your advice for a simple roasted turkey?  Oil or butter on the skin, flavor injectors, particular herbs?  It seems like everyone does this differently.  But it's easy to be left with a turkey that's too dry.
5633 2018-11-20 17:41:42 Buy all you can
5634 2018-11-20 17:41:39 If one more person talks to me about palm oil whilst eating meat I’m gonna kick off  people will do everything to save the planet apart from reduce/stop consuming meat and dairy 
5635 2018-11-20 17:41:28 The same way we cringe at oil bronzed or brass fixtures.
5636 2018-11-20 17:41:24 I got getah nangka on my finger and went to my room without realising it so I used makeup remover to remove it and it worked better than using oil
5637 2018-11-20 17:41:21 So true. And they can never provide an objective test for "leaky gut syndrome" (or now leaky brain), as it doesn't exist. The patient/customer must take it all on faith. Snake oil exemplified.
5638 2018-11-20 17:41:16 Anything with tea tree oil in it
5639 2018-11-20 17:41:09 Oh but that’s different. They have something we want. $ & oil.
5640 2018-11-20 17:41:09 Yes. Why should it matter to us in America? The trump tax break fiasco easily would exceed any SA “investment” here. We don’t need their oil or their money. The money’s nice but at what cost?
5641 2018-11-20 17:41:06 Drop in oil today imho will only lead to a more sweeping cut in production from OPEC next month. Going to be an interesting month
5642 2018-11-20 17:41:05 I haven’t smoked bud in a minute. Been on this oil wave but I may need to throw back and roll one up.
5643 2018-11-20 17:41:03 This mom at speedy oil is bein an asshole to her kids lol. Makes me think of my mom  when I was younger 
5644 2018-11-20 17:40:58 #oott: Trump may stick by SA, but will SA stick by him after the last decision.  SA is not very happy with the waivers for Iranian oil exports.

5651 2018-11-20 17:40:31 LOL The notion that Trump is dictating oil prices.

5656 2018-11-20 17:40:11 Buy fresh ingredients specially when its meat, veggies or fruits. Eating is so great and fun but make sure food is still healthy. Baking is better than frying. If you want fried chicken try baked chicken. Just coat chicken with breading mix and bake it. It removes most of the oil

5660 2018-11-20 17:40:02 I like how Notley had to hire a special envoy from Toronto to tell us how to upgrade our oil, after the special Chief of Staff in the Energy Ministry - also from Toronto - couldn't figure it out. 

She should stop trying to "help" us and just phone it in for the next 6 months
5661 2018-11-20 17:39:59 Oil of cloves, not too nice taste wise but does help if u rub it round the gum area of tooth quite often
5662 2018-11-20 17:39:53 Peppermint oil...
5663 2018-11-20 17:39:53 Do NOT start frying in either petroleum or kerosine: it will ruin the flavour!  However, either would be better than HFO or bunker oil...
5664 2018-11-20 17:39:36 Could it be Philips 66? Anadarko? ConocoPhillips? Halliburton? CenterPoint? Occidental? BPUSA? Cabot Oil & Gas? 

Just off the top of my head.
5665 2018-11-20 17:39:31 I’m also aware that certain interests in the gas/oil world have funded anti coal efforts. So if they rough up the frackers, so be it.
5666 2018-11-20 17:39:24 @shefalil "considering how its ingredients compare to over-the-counter fish oil supplements."
In today article about #Vascepa you make this false statement. Maybe you should have told your readers that #Amarin's #Vascepa is VERY different from otc - Actual #Truth in reporting. 
5667 2018-11-20 17:39:24 Hahahaha. I don't think you are in a position to know what is given to Nigeria.  Neither are you in a position to know the volumes of cheap oil the US is getting from us.  Please it is better you speak of what you know.

5669 2018-11-20 17:39:10 Does she leave a trail of olive oil wherever she goes? Does she perpetually smell of basil and garlic?
5670 2018-11-20 17:39:00 Yup, Kelly has a few friends close to the Oil, doesn’t make stuff up. He makes a point of that, doesn’t claim to be an insider, just shares what he’s heard.
5671 2018-11-20 17:38:59 Great news and I’m really pleased for you! That oil vid is incredible - don’t think I blinked while watching it the first time. Definitely one of my favourite Rachelle moments 
5672 2018-11-20 17:38:57 Fish oil is one of the most highly marketed products today, but there is a catch, it may not be the best option for you, or for the environment.

Do you know why?

5674 2018-11-20 17:38:28 Omega-3. Just learned @carlsonlabs now adding sunflower seed oil to its oil as part of an "anti-oxidant blend." Any recs on other O-3 fish oil LIQUIDS (not gel caps) w/o additives? @bigfatsurprise @KetoDocCLT @tednaiman @DoctorTro @QuantifiedBob
5675 2018-11-20 17:38:26 .@BarryPetten asks the Minister what percentage of the oil is expected to be cleaned up? #nlpoli
5676 2018-11-20 17:38:24 Petten asks Coady: How does dissipation of the oil sheen affect clean up efforts?  Coady says if the sheen is dissipated and evaporated there will be no clean up, only to wildlife. @VOCMNEWS #nlpoli
5677 2018-11-20 17:38:20 It's almost like we shouldn't have let the oil industry collect royalties from itself all those years.
5678 2018-11-20 17:38:18 Senate has no credibility. It never had any!
5679 2018-11-20 17:38:17 The #Trump administration announced new sanctions designed to disrupt an alleged #Iranian and #Russian scheme to ship oil to #Syria, as part of Washington's "maximum pressure" campaign on #Tehran and a push to cut off fuel supplies for #Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.
5680 2018-11-20 17:38:02 shea butter & almond oil mixed together
5681 2018-11-20 17:37:58 Ordinary Shampoo with some drops of Cedarwood essential oil added? 
5682 2018-11-20 17:37:57 No, but they may use the wrong oil or get distracted and forget the oil
5683 2018-11-20 17:37:56 When @DAaronovitch snuffs it, he'll be remembered, if at all, for 2 things. Acting like a pillock on University Challenge and cheerleading for an illegal imperialist war for oil that killed a million people and created ISIS. What a legacy.
5684 2018-11-20 17:37:37 Top of my black friday shopping is to buy a vaccum cleaner and an essential oil humidifier
5685 2018-11-20 17:37:32 He and I also made the decision to boycott any and every thing made with palm oil for the same ethical reasons.   Too much blood is spilt in its production.
5686 2018-11-20 17:37:31 .@BarryPetten asks the Minister how can the oil be cleaned up if it cannot be seen?#nlpoli
5687 2018-11-20 17:37:30 Just when I think oil stocks can’t go any lower. Massive wash on $DNR
5688 2018-11-20 17:37:27 Not black but I have been told tea tree oil diluted with another oil (such as almond or castor for ex) will do wonders.
5689 2018-11-20 17:37:23 Treated myself to first class last night (York-London). Everyone very nice. But your sandwiches contained Palm oil fat. Please ensure none of your suppliers use this product because it is enabling the destruction of vast swathes of natural habitat. Thank you.

5692 2018-11-20 17:37:11 Powell has few avenues to arrive at soft landing. If inflation slows due to oil price decline stemming from global demand slowdown, that’s not particularly promising. And if layoffs pick up taking wage inflation pressures with them that’s also not a development he’d be happy with

5698 2018-11-20 17:36:53 I love Barry Fetcher cool stimulating shampoo and also the Cantu root rinse with apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil. I use it as a rinse after shampooing.

Too many frauds,

5700 2018-11-20 17:36:32 Petten asking about the clean up effort now that oil sheen dissipated. Coady says if it evaporated no clean up necessary.
5701 2018-11-20 17:36:30 @GOP's greatest weakness from Saudi Arabia to Russia = Oil.
5702 2018-11-20 17:36:29 - lavender oil so damn strong. ima fuck around and fall asleep because i used three drops instead of one lol
5703 2018-11-20 17:36:18 we make it just with olive oil, salt and pepper, no milk, and it tastes amazing.
5704 2018-11-20 17:36:16 Word to the wise: don’t take fish oil and then have a hot drink unless you want your burps to taste like fish. 
5705 2018-11-20 17:36:11 If I could suddenly own all the oil today I'd control a ton of value cause I power the majority of the economy which runs on oil even if I don't explicitly share in the profits of factories.
5706 2018-11-20 17:36:06 You have been influenced by misinformation spread by corporations making money off oil. That is the corrupt system. I read some from the link you provided, enough to see it was typical propaganda. I haven't tried to make a strong argument because I know I can't convince you.
5707 2018-11-20 17:36:02 Im finally home and like super stressed cause im tired and have no time for anything and apparently getting an oil change has to be a fckin quest but im gonna make time to draw jin in that playboy shoot outfit idccccc.

5709 2018-11-20 17:35:43 Far from it, no idea where you get that impression from. But their infrastructure, integrated transport, health and social care, and much, much else puts us to shame, as does their oil fund. But if your down on Norway, what about Brunei or Qatar?

5713 2018-11-20 17:35:17 @FoxBusiness I hope the oil goes to $30 a barrel. You mentioned gas tax. No way!! Democrats will divert it to illegal aliens like Moonbeam is doing in California. High gas prices mean bad economy. Low gas prices mean good economy.

5716 2018-11-20 17:34:48 I agree. You shouldn't need to have children to hold compassion for all living things. We all need to stop selling oil because its emissions are killing us all.

5719 2018-11-20 17:34:35 Facts are sacred!! We all know where this economy was in 2015. The Doldrums!! The reset button got us out of it and also grew our reserves by 100%,despite low oil prices and the recession. The reset button reduced corruption and leakages. These are the tangibles.
5720 2018-11-20 17:34:34 And they have palm oil in them. Bye bye Mars bars

5724 2018-11-20 17:34:27 Good one Karan.
There are many shades of the rise in oil prices vs the global crude basket and the various taxes levied by the Centre & State governments.
5725 2018-11-20 17:34:19 i would take the pimples if it meant my skin could produce some amount of oil
5726 2018-11-20 17:34:12 No. Alaskan Governor routinely is tech savvy in pipeline industry, multi-nat'l news, deep state global finance. But hey, go trek some -30F pipelines and tour frigid oil rigs at sea, then discuss war prep with USAF after delivering 1st whale harvest to mil 'birds'. Naive 48-er.

5736 2018-11-20 17:33:31 throw some shallots and garlic in the pan with some oil, then the wine, beef broth and a little balsamic vinegar. After that some thyme/ herbs you like. When it boils, lower the heat and wait 15mins.
5737 2018-11-20 17:33:30 But right now I can't really argue, the market is saying you are right and I am wrong. Tough trading out there LOL. I do like the $XOM suggestion. Willing to give these some drawdown, I think things could turn really quickly these days with oil and the geopolitical situation.

5748 2018-11-20 17:31:57 I particularly like how they spin the way 'rich countries' tend to export their environmental degradation. Palm oil, anyone?
5749 2018-11-20 17:31:54 Went to get an oil change & I had a free coupon so I wanted to give the guy a tip.

5753 2018-11-20 17:31:49 You didn't answer my question of why planetary scientists, who get no money related to climate change, are firmly convinced of the truth of anthropogenic climate change.

Also, do you not believe oil companies make any money?
5754 2018-11-20 17:31:47 Any place you can drop a bit of oil? Or is there space for noise insulation firted around it? 
5755 2018-11-20 17:31:42 I'll pass that on to my husband! He adds frozen veggies, sesame oil, and a lil spy sauce to turn them into lo mein, if you haven't tried that yet!

5762 2018-11-20 17:31:05 Our Scalp Revival Shampoo has coconut oil, & due to its natural formulation, it can separate over time. This is why the texture looks different! Try remixing it with a spoon before using it. It also doesn't sud as much as other shampoos, but it's still getting the job done 
5763 2018-11-20 17:30:57 And you still get your oil from Wilmar, one of the biggest dirty palm oil traders in the world?

5766 2018-11-20 17:30:37 I do remember that the yield curve had inverted and that oil was at about $150 and "going to $250".  

Rising oil prices and an inverted yield curve have always been pretty good predictors of recessions.

Yield curve is still positive and oil is falling.  Head scratchers!!

We can't go shopping because markets are closed & supermarkets have been vandalized. Jumbo Score is on fire.

Yeah, that's why rising the price of oil, when there is a car based urban planning & the standard of living is low, is a bad idea.

5787 2018-11-20 17:28:39 Oil prices dropped sharply, snapping a four-day winning streak amid concerns about rising global supplies as OPEC weighs a possible cut in production.
5788 2018-11-20 17:28:33 The division & anger we now experience has nothing to do with rulers who were here when 'explorers' arrived. All of Africa's resources have been hijacked while the majority of its native people still live in poverty - oil, farming land, gold, diamonds, platinum, etc
5789 2018-11-20 17:28:32 I am not sure that Russia has a law on overseas bribery that is strongly enforced. They can probably offer mor of the value extracted from the from the oil to the currently leading faction than an Atlantic based PetroCo. And Indian oil companies just don't produce oil effectively

5810 2018-11-20 17:26:22 You are right, not happening in short time but let say next Christmas. 
why is going down? Trump is independent and prefers Jeb, George Bush senior and junior's business, Texas oil not to be around, this is exactly what  Putin and Saudi Arabia wants too. One less completion.
5811 2018-11-20 17:26:16 Depends on what percentage of the Scottish economy is to come from oil production. 

20% - Norway
95% - Venezuela
Economy from oil and gas. 

Income tax from Norway is 55%
Corporation tax 28 - 78%

Don't know what figures for Scotland could be but 55% would be very difficult.

5823 2018-11-20 17:25:33 According to government insiders, who told TheCable that the Korean company tried to derail the addition of a potential 200,000 barrels per day to Nigeria’s current oil out.   #SamsungFinancialCrisis
5824 2018-11-20 17:25:29 Oil also saw sharp declines as Brent Crude continued its recent trend lower to $63.81.  Despite declines of 25% prices at the pump have barely moved.

5826 2018-11-20 17:25:23 I thought it is the EU that requires palm oil as their fuel additive. As far as I know, there is at least 6% added to fuel (much like ethanol in the US). You state this palm oil disaster was lead by the US. Please explain.
5827 2018-11-20 17:25:21 "Why aren't we talking about the oil spill"

Umm, everybody is talking about the oil spill
5828 2018-11-20 17:25:20 The only painting I see happening around this thing is when I'm using a brush apply oil to its body as it slowly roasts over open fire
5829 2018-11-20 17:25:12 In addition, he did not talk about $100 oil.  All he said that sanctions will reduce Iran oil exports significantly.
Also, I assure you, he was not the intended In  my tweet.

5853 2018-11-20 17:23:15 They did profit from the started wars. Oil. They are privileged people.
They never felt a tiny struggle in their lives. They've been spoiled since young age. Look at the president they installed now...an insufferable spoiled crybaby who doesn't even respect his own advisors.

5878 2018-11-20 17:21:22 It's not really that they need science ,they ignore it because it conflicts with the Oil industry...

I honestly think it's too late now. Canada and USA are not interested in cutting GHG emissions..
5879 2018-11-20 17:21:16 For it to be less profitable to deny it than do something about it.

You're really yelling at the FF industry while giving all the credit to Trump. No, he hasn't done anything new or innovative in this sense. It's just business as usual for big oil. Same for big war/guns etc.

5937 2018-11-20 17:16:15 Oil prices have dropped by almost $20 per barrel recently - this should push inflation down as well.

Of course, much Alberta oil is getting to US refiners. Part of perceived problem is too much investment that created too much supply. There's also annual maintenance of US refineries.

5953 2018-11-20 17:15:01 Where is the Integrity :-
When the person of VP is battling with N5.8b fraud? 
When the oil minister/CinC cannot account for billions of oil revenues ?
When we have seen so many fraudulent practices that have never seen in our history?
We cannot not be deceived again this time.
5954 2018-11-20 17:15:00 USD/NOK hits an 18-month high at 8.575 as oil extends its losses
5955 2018-11-20 17:14:56 Use v good flour, and you can make it without.  But if you want the texture of a traditional fresh pasta, use a little oil and a protein like an egg replacement (or silken tofu!) like Tal Ronnen at @Crossroads in LA - their pasta is the best! Depends on style too.
5956 2018-11-20 17:14:44 Tree tea oil on a cotton bud?
5957 2018-11-20 17:14:44 Yh it seems to just be trial and error with this I also started vaping cbd oil (I’m not a smoker) and that helps me manage too x

5963 2018-11-20 17:14:26 Lol ok what does your Castor oil bottle look like ? BC I've been looking for some
5964 2018-11-20 17:14:25 Sorely disappointed that any store would do this, let alone one that recently made an advert about the destruction caused by palm oil. If you're truly worried about the environment you should be INCREASING your vegan options, not restricting them! I can't comprehend your decision
5965 2018-11-20 17:14:18 It’s expensive but Moroccan Oil has one for dark hair and it smells BOMB
5966 2018-11-20 17:14:14 Then does Citgo become restricted and sanctioned from financial transfers and imports of oil from Venezuela
5967 2018-11-20 17:13:56 # Michelle Obama who would ask for her advice I mean really she was on The Ellen Show dick swinging back and forth without a care she's a transvestite or pardon me she hasn't gone through with the full service yet it's like an oil change nowadays

5975 2018-11-20 17:13:44 Oil prices tumble. “Oil should not be this low,” says the CNN newsreader.

This was unexpected, thank you, Lord.

5977 2018-11-20 17:13:37 Ah, but it polymerizes so well in a cast iron pan!  And it is so much cheaper for this purpose than Flaxseed Oil(food-grade Linseed Oil).
5978 2018-11-20 17:13:36 Brent crude oil at more than a year lows due to over supply fears going into 2019.
Global demand has also fallen as winter season begins and prospects of weak economic growths in 2019
5979 2018-11-20 17:13:25 I get that and disagree but again, he wanted that term for a reason.
5980 2018-11-20 17:13:22 Surely better to recognise the positive thing they’re trying by removing palm oil rather than demanding they change everything else as well ?? Cheer up

5994 2018-11-20 17:12:21 Aye, Norway offered to go halfers for a North sea cable to connect Scotland to European grid. Guess who helped block it, Lord Smith of Kelvin, who also sat on board of Scottish Power.
They fucked our oil boom and are doing same with renewables. Abusive & controlling as ever!

5996 2018-11-20 17:12:18 Our consumer culture is toxic, but there's little we as individuals can do about it. Profit motive and lack of demand for alternatives also ensures that companies in a capitalist system won't seriously pursue alternatives as long as coal, oil, etc. remain cheap and abundant.
5997 2018-11-20 17:12:18 Countries of the world ditch the dollar and gain financial independence . The EU should buy Iranian oil in euros and any other country should use their own currency or gold.

6022 2018-11-20 17:10:24 Why is the oil industry basically always in panic mode? 

And why do get sucked into pandering to its whims?
6023 2018-11-20 17:10:22 The foolish must have assumed they had enough oil, or that it would all work out, else they would have brought extra jars and not been counted among the foolish.

6027 2018-11-20 17:10:08 It’s face cream o not body oil 
6028 2018-11-20 17:10:07 Interesting decision @MRand9 ..  wait and see on this one. I think the Oil needed a new voice. Not 100% sure Hitch is the guy but Oil lacked 3 things imo:
1. Consistent hard work
2. Commitment to defense 
3. Accountability 
won't change the talent level but its a start

6042 2018-11-20 17:08:32 Canadian oil down another %13.44. Is there any chance we will see a bottom or are we going to have to start giving our oil away for free, while we give the Saudi's $300 million a month?
6043 2018-11-20 17:08:29 I respect team-makers so much, I'm probably biased, but they're amazing people. Like oil keeping the gear moving smoothly 
6044 2018-11-20 17:08:15 Thats too bad. I like my insults. Anyways go ahead and say lock her up or tar and feather her or dip her in hot oil. The point is moot. Once Hillary got away with it, the standard was set.

6049 2018-11-20 17:07:58 My view is optimistic because of the intangibles we possess - scientific expertise, law, finance , the language etc. But we won't know for a while! Worth saying also that there are other effects far more important than Brexit . Worth looking up what an oil price rise does to GDP.

6084 2018-11-20 17:05:02 US markets are all red. Blood on the floor. Lower crude oil prices. Good news for the us. Bad news for Africa's giant.
6085 2018-11-20 17:04:59 Are you walking away or taking a penny less than the $3M per he was owed?

6087 2018-11-20 17:04:54 Oil have sucked for a decade and despite numerous #1 and top 10 picks you still suck.  Mgmt sucks.  Worse problem has to be ownerships inability to hire proper mgmt.  i feel sorry for fans.

6089 2018-11-20 17:04:42 Americans who fund these groups care, they care about the massive discount they get courtesy of the campaign against oil sands. But the enviro groups won’t admit their funding is tainted in hypocrisy!
6090 2018-11-20 17:04:34 Sitting in a Jiffy Lube and Days of our Lives is playing on the tv. Feel like I’m back in the 80’s, tho I’m not sure why the smell of motor oil brings nostalgia.
6091 2018-11-20 17:04:33 where’s my oil mom stream
6092 2018-11-20 17:04:27 Fun Hitla fact:  The Great Eastern front they always threatened Col. Klink with is pretty much a myth. Stalin abandonded Lenin Grad,because it was Anti Stalinistic communism.  The Eastern Front consisted of 150 mile push into Russia to obtain the rich oil reserves of the Caucasas
6093 2018-11-20 17:04:25 It took a huge amount of guts for $AMRN to finish this study. I can't imagine how tough you'd have to be to do a Vascepa vs. OTC fish oil study. (It would also be hard to blind the trial).
6094 2018-11-20 17:04:22 Iceland making a stand against palm oil but removing/downsizing their vegan freezers for Christmas even though AnAg is the leading cause of deforestation worldwide is a perfect example of performative justice.
6095 2018-11-20 17:04:21 SJAC's workshops regularly scheduled for Tuesdays - Oil Painting and Sewing: Christmas Stocking, have been cancelled for this evening & will have a make up class. We plan to keep offices and galleries open until 5pm, unless weather conditions begin to change rapidly. Stay safe!
6096 2018-11-20 17:04:03 Crude oil will be the topic when the @CNBCFuturesNow crew joins the @HalftimeReport --Will OPEC cut --What's driving prices? We answer all that and more
6097 2018-11-20 17:03:55 Norwegian oil company Equinor, plans to open onshore exploration drilling wells in Turkey, Argentina, Algeria and Russia in 2019
6098 2018-11-20 17:03:53 Would depend - e.g. if you cut the AB CCIR, the after-tax return to a new, low emissions oil sands project would be lower than with the CCIR in place. That's due to combo of carbon price and OBAs.  Same is true for small biz if you also took out ctax-funded small biz tax cut.
6099 2018-11-20 17:03:52 #oil looks like capitulation - Just when I thought it had hit rock bottom another trap drawer opened - savage percentage drop in two weeks -- will bounce but when?
6100 2018-11-20 17:03:39 Hehe...you think the oil in those pipelines belongs to you.
6101 2018-11-20 17:03:39 Ben je pense que la hausse du prix du pétrole est non seulement inéluctable à moyen/long terme (Peak oil etc) mais indispensable à court terme (climat), donc je suis bien content de savoir qu'ils "luttent" mais je ne peux pas soutenir ça.
6102 2018-11-20 17:03:31 Seriously, though, what kind of dirt does Peter Chiarelli have on Daryl Katz that he still has a JOB after trading as many #1 picks as he has and driving the franchise so deep into the Earth's crust you CAN'T FIND OIL?
6103 2018-11-20 17:03:14 I feel like Hitch is gonna retire after this season, and coach Q is gonna go to St. Louis. And were gonna be left with slim pickins after this... #oil #itspetesfault
6104 2018-11-20 17:03:11 Or piss off one of the few allies we have in the Middle East & one of the largest suppliers of foreign oil. Neither would have a positive affect for the U.S. that is why we haven’t gone after the future King of Saudi Arabia.
6105 2018-11-20 17:03:10 I need an oil change already? Damn 
6106 2018-11-20 17:03:09 Good and I hope it stays that way. just hope there is no oil up there.
6107 2018-11-20 17:02:58 BREAKING: @USTreasury announces sanctions on participants in complex scheme involving #Iran and #Russian companies supplying millions of barrels of oil to Syrian regime, and then to to #HAMAS and #Hezbollah.
6108 2018-11-20 17:02:55 And ur right. Definitely did to a T, we got plenty of oil left too, it's in the colors of the uniform,  "black gold", aka oil..we want all the smoke..#WhoDat..#1 team, SB favorites.

6110 2018-11-20 17:02:45 - get a humidifier 
- if you use a matte lipstick, but lip balm on first
- use a lip oil to hydrate your lips
- for a plumper look you could use an ice cube
- a clear or sparkling lip gloss is a good option
6111 2018-11-20 17:02:42 The weirdest bit for me was that it isn't even their advert. It's Greenpeace. I saw it loads before  Iceland bought it or whatever. Also, they're removing their vegan freezers to make room for Christmas products. Even though anag causes more deforestation than palm oil.
6112 2018-11-20 17:02:42 It's interesting b/c Hitch always wante the gig but was passed over for it a couple of times. The thing is, if he gets this group to play a defence-first system and gets them into the playoffs, there is a chance they keep him around. #Oilers
6113 2018-11-20 17:02:40 i don't know why i never realized patchouli is a plant

6114 2018-11-20 17:02:37 An empty oil cartridge, some flower, but no blunt....  A nigga gotta make a move.  Some smoke always goes wit’ ‘deze instrumentals.
6115 2018-11-20 17:02:36 I'd love to see some peer-reviewed evidence on food-grade cottonseed oil safety. So far you've used terms like "toxic," "fake food," and "unsafe" - they don't make it seem like you're evaluating the science objectively.
6116 2018-11-20 17:02:26 Treasury sanctions Russia-Iran oil network for supporting Syria's Assad

6121 2018-11-20 17:02:06 Today’s @USTreasury action targeting the Russia-Iran oil scheme to prop up Assad, and finance Hizballah & Hamas, sends a clear message: there are grave consequences for anyone shipping oil to Syria, or trying to evade U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s terrorist activities.
6122 2018-11-20 17:01:56 Abi it was fried with anointing oil
6123 2018-11-20 17:01:55 is that going to even work? Do you see Russian companies involved in the Iran/Syria oil trade?
6124 2018-11-20 17:01:54 Will shortly read the article but fighting climate change can only happen when working together to achieve common goals. Scotland setting world leading action working with EU, in control of its own oil fields can be huge. Do we extract the oil or do we store it. UK will extract.
6125 2018-11-20 17:01:52 Can understand re Brexit but...

Indy claimed Oil barrel would rise from $90 to $120 and there was still a financial hole >>>> noting crude oil now $60 a barrel 

+ Spain will always veto Scotland's entry to EU
6126 2018-11-20 17:01:52 Here's a 'oil/fat' guide for South Indian cooks by my mom.  
1. Ghee - goes well with Paruppu (dal) based dishes - esp Rasam.
2. Sesame oil - goes well with tamarind based dishes - eg Vatha Kuzhambu.
3. Coconut oil - goes well with veggie based dishes -eg Avial

6130 2018-11-20 17:01:29 @kenjilopezalt And why? Are there specifically times where veg oils are a better tool? Im aware of smoke points and flavor neutrality, but I also expect that since veg oil is only about a half step removed from motor oil anyway. :)  Thanks in advance.
6131 2018-11-20 17:01:24 “Okay, sure. Sounds nice...”

Though his attention has drifted from Foleo to the ornate decor of the room. Oil paintings, gilded furniture adorned with motifs of flowers and doves, and a fresco of stars on the ceiling? It’s like a castle

“Why would you ever leave your room?”
6132 2018-11-20 17:01:21 The counter point is: steep falls in crude oil price and US equities is not a great sign for Indian equities.
6133 2018-11-20 17:01:18 The government of Thailand has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Tobey Maguire in a lamé wig.

6139 2018-11-20 17:00:49 If Scots charge reasonable  economic rates for basics such as gas, electricity, water, and food, poss even oil, we could be quids in, so what are you complaining about?  At the moment markets, the power market in particular, are grossly distorted in favour of southern England.

6142 2018-11-20 17:00:24 I've always liked Hitch but am surprised he agreed to come on board, as he was looked over for the job in the past and it didn't sit well with him.
6143 2018-11-20 17:00:24 Past Presidencies have overlooked #Saudi dictatorship’s human rights abuses and other shortcomings, because they bought our weapons (we also bought their oil) & they tacitly supported us.  But their murder of #JamalKhashoggi crossed a line.  We need vastly better allies.
6144 2018-11-20 17:00:22 I feel personally she could of googles to find out how to remove she already didn’t know that oil would. But it’s common since brights stain I didn’t see any hives but I’m hoping she’s ok. I think the Sti was anlil much

6150 2018-11-20 17:00:03 Well, if Hitch likes coaching non-skilled plugs he's going to LOVE being behind the bench with the Oil.

6154 2018-11-20 16:59:57 I recall hearing a stat that for every $10 the price of a barrel of oil increases, it knocks something like a $600,000,000 hole in the DOD budget?
6155 2018-11-20 16:59:54 As long as it’s not short Nat Gas & long Oil at the wrong time.
6156 2018-11-20 16:59:32 Fml my car leaking oil so i got an oil change and they didnt say anything was wrong. Then they said i have a nail in my tire which i cant get pluged cause the tread too low now my check engine light on and i only 80$ in my savings so fml
6157 2018-11-20 16:59:14 Everything is usually opposite. This year much more so. But there's been some seriously good mj news lately that has not popped the stocks. I think they will soon if we are seeing general market and oil capitulation today.
6158 2018-11-20 16:59:06 The oil differential in Canada is passing Value from producers for free to pipeliners and refiners who earn margins normally earned by producers.

It's like paying your pizza delivery guy $19 to collect $15 so you don't have to store the cheese because you have nowhere to put it
6159 2018-11-20 16:59:03 remember in armageddon when the  entire premise of the movie hinged on the idea that it is a better plan to teach oil rig workers to be astronauts than to teach astronauts how to use a drill?
6160 2018-11-20 16:58:57 Oil is traded in US dollars.  China and Venezuela have been negotiating to transact oil sales in Yuan.  Once oil is traded in other currencies, what will happen to the demand for dollars?
6161 2018-11-20 16:58:45 Fuck car insurance ..fuck oil changes ...fuck gas....
6162 2018-11-20 16:58:41 @Gladwell I have been a devotee of cannabis since 6/10/65, 53 years. I was diagnosed with aggressive liver cancer 3 years ago...after two chemo episodes...I am 18 months in remission. After the my cancer returned, I added concentrated cannabis oil to daily meds, guess what? 1/2
6163 2018-11-20 16:58:40 Panic is when your oil change isn’t done yet and you have an hour to go pick up your brothers from school... and I’m 30 minutes from their school.... I hope this is done in the next 15 mins. I’ve been here for like an hour pls. I can’t be late I have their conferences today FUCK
6164 2018-11-20 16:58:39 anyone coming to me for advice is going to get 1 of 3 responses. 
1. yes, eat that.
2. no, do not text him back.
3. coconut oil.
6165 2018-11-20 16:58:38 I don't think so. How we will produce so much energy to all this cars!? The best way to think the future of energy is not one source of energy in the place of the other but a many sources of energy adequate to a specific use (oil, gas, electricity, hydrogen)!
6166 2018-11-20 16:58:29 On one hand, I love giving my bf a massage because he works hard and needs one and I love rubbing oil on his naked body; on the other hand, I can’t stop thinking about vore porn and wondering what people taste like. Am I.... broken?
6167 2018-11-20 16:58:25 There’s pretty much no hockey today, my timeline is basically just an oil can on fire. Dinner and then bed for me I think

Oil is plunging again this morning (down almost 6%) on persistent fears that a surplus will re-emerge next year despite OPEC’s plans to cut production.
6169 2018-11-20 16:58:21 I just love it how Austrians manage to play East and West so flawlessly, they're not in NATO but they know they don't need to be, they play oil and gas with Russia, they can piss on Turkey etc. Quite a case study they are...
6170 2018-11-20 16:58:14 Been on mesalazine products for 20yrs, probably have no effect (ilium inflammation). Exercise for the last 15yrs. Thought my diet was ‘healthy’ went NSNG no seed oil over a year ago, feel great, most systemic problems 90% better...
6171 2018-11-20 16:58:08 You're good at deceiving, why don't you go work for the ICPP? you know they liars about climate change, the scheme set up by actual oil barons, Lol how the people haven't a clue, but I do.
6172 2018-11-20 16:58:03 Chef @kenjilopezalt, over 18 mo. Ive been actively removing toxic veg oil from my families' life and Ive wanted to get your opinion on this. As a beancounter myself I understand in a commercial kitchen controlling costs are paramount, but at home do you use  Veg oils or Olive oil
6173 2018-11-20 16:57:51 .  Saudis are strict about betrayal by death.  That said they were wrong to do what the did but can't jeapardize American interests . Use as leverage for Saudis corperation on world terrorism.  Don't let oil prices going up be winner to death of reporter. Trump right !!
6174 2018-11-20 16:57:44 Hate when you go for an oil change & they come back to with all these so called problems with your car

BUT IT ALSO TAKES ON ITS SURROUNDING SCENTS. LIKE IF ITS NEAR A TOWN/IN IT, ITLL SMELL LIKE CARS, FUEL, OR OIL. YET IF ITS IN THE WOODS IT'LL-
6179 2018-11-20 16:57:25 Also, colonial looting of other countries riches and the work done by slaves building your country played a huge part in making the country what it is today. That looting continues though wars which influence oil and gold prices and geopolitical issues.

6182 2018-11-20 16:57:17 okay ,I keep my curls defined by keeping it moisturized , for me my hair gets dry quick so I generally put oil on my scalp and make sure it gets all in.  Yes , my hair reverted back after begin straighten. But I prep my hair before just straightening it.

6196 2018-11-20 16:55:47 @Oil_Drop Hey man, what do you think about the hiring of Hitchcock?
6197 2018-11-20 16:55:39 That would be a problem because Trump got SA to agree to make up the lost oil coming out of Iran before we dropped out of the nuclear agreement.
6198 2018-11-20 16:55:28 @LaBeautyologist when you mention oils after moisturizer, does it have to be a "face specific" oil or is something like Jojoba oil okay?
6199 2018-11-20 16:55:20 It's not a matter of bin brainwashed this is fact n am objective .

6201 2018-11-20 16:55:06 #Oil looks like it may be in the process of bottoming.  Had a few day bounce, then goes to new lows but RSI doesn't.  Look for a "W" pattern more than likely instead of the "V" that oil traders want.

6208 2018-11-20 16:54:48 We do have CBD oil in. We have different strengths depending on what you want it for. Anywhere from 250 mg to 2000 mg. Very high quality!

6211 2018-11-20 16:54:45 Another girl and I ran head-on directly into each other in Midnight Oil yesterday and at the exact same time we both said “ope, sorry!” The west is calling me home, I belong back in Colorado
6212 2018-11-20 16:54:44 but if you can’t change your own oil every 3k miles you shouldn’t drive
6213 2018-11-20 16:54:36 We are a northern nation & depend on oil & gas to heat homes. God knows in Ont you can be devastated financially trying to heat with electricity.

Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.
6216 2018-11-20 16:54:21 State is hitting oil with HFT to try to fix zero growth environment. This is an old tactic for them & then they blame the recession on high oil prices. Most know better and Matt Simmons believed that a real global recovery would come on the back of a high oil price not a low one.

6222 2018-11-20 16:53:47 Also and gargle with eucalyptus essential oil instead of peppermint.
6223 2018-11-20 16:53:43 There are lies and then there are the WHOOPERS that oil companies tell. We all know what your motives are, $$$. So stop pretending you care about anything else.
6224 2018-11-20 16:53:38 I plan to defrost my turkey in hot oil.
6225 2018-11-20 16:53:32 10. Nigerian crude oil could lose value: With the dwindling price of oil, and the growing concern about carbon poisoning caused by crude oil, the world is moving toward a green environment. Hence, revenue generated by oil  will make little or no sense
6226 2018-11-20 16:53:27 The 35b pallet even stains so why are you so shocked... how are you going to complain when you literally used a wipe as your cleanser lmao you need to use an oil based cleanser and go see a doctor you weirdo
6227 2018-11-20 16:53:23 some people don’t have the time so oil, filter and labor is around $60

6229 2018-11-20 16:53:05 Fill the sink or a bowl with hot water and eucalyptus essential oil and breathe in the steam. Also, try gargling with 2 to 3 drops of peppermint essential oil and warm 8oz. Glass of water a few times. 
Might want to check with your physician first.
6230 2018-11-20 16:52:50 Oh man! I agree but please don’t hound this company out of business. The reason being that walkers switched to rapeseed oil but REAL crisps stuck with sunflower oil. Rseed triggers seizures in my son who also has autism so has a bag of the ‘Fisherman’ crisps everyday as routine.

6233 2018-11-20 16:52:33 So I take it after the election the Alberta NDP will start saying how bad oil is, right. Falling into line with their federal counterparts.
6234 2018-11-20 16:52:19 I just know a lot of people out of work in the chemical/ oil and gas industry who would love to work and I think doing this Ofer Christmas is pretty shitty and I know it takes two to tango not blaming the workers solely
6235 2018-11-20 16:52:16 You dont need an oil filter wrench, your oil filter should be hand tight

6237 2018-11-20 16:52:06 We cook two turkeys every Thanksgiving, one in the oven and one on the grill, and they come out perfect. The secret? Layer bacon strips over the entire turkey, tent with aluminum foil, comes out perfect every time. Also salt, pepper and rub the turkey with veg oil prior to cook.
6238 2018-11-20 16:52:01 Right!? You don't need math for things. Not for things like guns, missiles, mining for coal, drilling for oil, calculating debt & trade figures, and certainly no math needed for building a wall. The president doesn't know any math, and he got to be POTUS just by whining a lot.

6243 2018-11-20 16:51:40 I came to valvoline and expected to spend about $45 on an oil change. I ended up spending $91  this is why I hate going to car places by myself bc I lowkey feel like I’m getting finessed
6244 2018-11-20 16:51:39 Umm, I don't even care about the Oilers but the game has passed Hitch a few times over. His methods are prehistoric. Sorry Oil but you needed new ideas.
6245 2018-11-20 16:51:31 We all know that the $ from oil NEVER benefits First Nation communities or children!!! It’s a naive, but pernicious assumption at best... a noxious, malignant lie at worst, the kind that branded White people as the most hypocritical & toxic animal that ever was. So let’s drop it!

6248 2018-11-20 16:51:19 8. Less dependence on Oil: Due to the fact, that states now control their resources, crude oil will no longer be the main source of revenue for the country; leading to the increase in diversity in revenue generation. Some states could go into manufacturing, some into real estate

6253 2018-11-20 16:51:10 The difference is that labor unions are interested in advancing the interests of workers, whereas pharmaceutical and oil and gas companies are interested in profits rather than their customers.

6256 2018-11-20 16:51:01 In other news, Andy Hall is bullish on oil
6257 2018-11-20 16:50:56 Classic. All the old school guys have been in cash for a several weeks now, since interest rates are moving up. Fundamental change in the market & how valued. FANGs too far too fast. Oil diving? Boost cash? Good call Goldman, is that like CL@ 200? Setting up for mother of a buy!
6258 2018-11-20 16:50:54 Try a vegable oil dear to get it off your eyes. And I know you can't afford a doctor but try to go to the pharmacy to talk to a pharmacist yo see if they can give you a idea on what to use . I m truly sorry you r getting a bunch of negative shit, but stay true to yout
6259 2018-11-20 16:50:52 Yeah...that & "Oh look, we're the biggest oil producer in the world!" are mutually exclusive...
6260 2018-11-20 16:50:52 Guys I just discovered @frankiemuniz and Paige Price have an olive oil and vinegar company and wow do I want to throw all my money at them these products look incredible
6261 2018-11-20 16:50:45 my skin is really dry bc of the weather and i accidentally exfoliated more than i was supposed to this week so its all irritated . i put the oily-est oil i have on and now i have to interview someone for my article looking like an oily little gremlin
6262 2018-11-20 16:50:42 I have lived in southern Spain for 15 years. They love their pork (wit all the fat) and their fish. They also eat a lot of chicken, with double the fat as in Norway. They also eat a lot of legumes and vegetables, olive oil and nuts. And they drink a lot of wine and beer. 
6263 2018-11-20 16:50:42 Beautiful day in the oil patch
6264 2018-11-20 16:50:37 My latest batch of Beer & Bongwater Body Bar soap failed.   Maybe I need to revise my recipe to include less olive oil and more Hemp Butter???
6265 2018-11-20 16:50:33 The ad that was banned was the Iceland ad about the Orang Utan because it's actually a Greenpeace ad they've adopted to highlight the Palm Oil problem.
6266 2018-11-20 16:50:25 Capaz do oil voltar em 30 e na bomba continuar em 4,15
6267 2018-11-20 16:50:07 Import n export ...If they can manage inventory then oil prices should not affect much
6268 2018-11-20 16:49:55 The issues about this is the location and the fact that this is a big break with Viet policy if its just for a military location. I guess this would be tied up to India's exploration of oil fields there.

6271 2018-11-20 16:49:46 In my lifetime, I have never even set foot in Lucas Oil Statium. I can't afford tickets to anything. I stopped watching the NFL and I can't even afford Budweiser anymore. And I am fine with all of the above. The rich keep getting richer and no one cares about the poor.

6281 2018-11-20 16:48:28 Okay to sum up yesterday:
Ivanka is a raging hypocrite
Ford is now the enemy of the LGBT community in Ontario
Trump is still evil
Oil spill in Atlantic Canada
Tragic shooting in Chicago which will not motivate anyone to change anything

Did I get everything?

6283 2018-11-20 16:48:14 Oil will continue to play a vital role in meeting rising energy demand, which is why #Saudi_Aramco is focused on innovative, cost-effective technologies to reduce methane leaks, minimize the use of #flaring & decrease #emissions from transportation #COP24

6285 2018-11-20 16:48:03 The USA (who is illegally presented in Eastern parts in Syria and siding with a regime that murder journalists inside embassies) wants to prohibit Syrian people from getting oil!
6286 2018-11-20 16:48:02 Pretty sure he said unemployment was at 42% under Obama.  He gets elected,  suddenly he uses the same number used by all economists and everyone else.

6287 2018-11-20 16:48:00 Oil is in retrograde
6288 2018-11-20 16:47:53 Many thought that the popular wisdom of " what goes up also comes down" is not applicable to oil prices. But this #wisdom has proven itself more than once in last few years.
6289 2018-11-20 16:47:48 Prediction

6295 2018-11-20 16:47:29 Ok I’m just going to say this now. If you graduated or currently go to a county school and aren’t going to Lucas Oil to cheer on @EHS_Panthers as they try to become a state champion this Friday, you should be ashamed of yourself! This week is all about #PANTHERPRIDE 
6296 2018-11-20 16:47:23 Is anything ever be enough to prevent oil prices to stop falling ?

6318 2018-11-20 16:45:32 i feel sad as shit, but is that gonna stop us? no ma’am, we’re gonna make ourselves a gr8 breakfast, go buy new makeup and oil paints and have a good day!
6319 2018-11-20 16:45:30 Snake oil again.
6320 2018-11-20 16:45:27 It kills me how we have this crazy boom bust situation because we are so dependent on oil. When we are presented with options for economic diversification such as green energy, the RW lose their collective minds and scream that the LW is trying to kill oil and gas SMH
6321 2018-11-20 16:45:19 No. Watch oil. It's at scary levels ATM.
6322 2018-11-20 16:45:07 India's October Crude oil Imports jump 10.5% Y/Y to 21.02million tonnes up from 19.03MT in 2017

6330 2018-11-20 16:44:49 That is bizarre. Like, I think vegan meringue is weird and kind of wrong, because you have to add tons more sugar, but just swapping out butter/spread for oil? Like, I'd do that for a dairy free person and no one would think twice.
Also, most margarines are vegan, I think?

Don't we Indians deserve something releif from high prices
6342 2018-11-20 16:43:41 Anyone who thought Trump cared about small business ignored the many instances of him stiffing contractors, just because he knew they couldn’t afford to fight his lawyers.  Wake up, Trump supporters.  You are drinking snake oil.
6343 2018-11-20 16:43:41 That's why you killed gadaffi and Sadam they knew it was worthless and were about to stop trading there oil by the US dollar merica couldn't have that so you had to fabricate a war to kill them to keep the dollar going but that just put a plaster on the situation

6349 2018-11-20 16:42:58 With all the digital cameras that are sssooo much cheaper this tradition should be switched to a cost savings instead of an oil painting no doubt taken from a digital print to begin with! But that would make too much sense when the tax payer is on the hook!

6362 2018-11-20 16:42:03 Hi @Oreo - when are you going to stop using palm oil?  Your suppliers have destroyed 70,000 hectares of rainforest in the last 2 years alone!! Us humans don’t NEED Oreos to survive, but many species like Orangutans NEED the rainforest to be able to survive.@GreenpeaceUK
6363 2018-11-20 16:41:57 On the scale of adulthood I fall somewhere between going to doctors appointments by myself and my mom still having to tell me to change my oil
6364 2018-11-20 16:41:41 Have a hot Epsom salt bath with lavender oil in it and then crawl back into bed.  I don't know why this is so effective but it is, it will knock you out, make you sweat, and you will wake up feeling better.  Vaporub under your nose and also on your feet with a pair of socks helps
6365 2018-11-20 16:41:39 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
6366 2018-11-20 16:41:33 Thank you! The measure of oil volatility I was looking at was the CBOE/Nymex WTI Volatility Index (OIV INDEX <GO> when using a terminal). Hitting the highest since 2016 today.

6368 2018-11-20 16:41:17 Good philosophers make the complex comprehensible, fraudulent snake oil salesmen often try to make the simple incomprehensible.

Or as my teacher said, If I can't understand your code, how do I know you did when you wrote it?

6390 2018-11-20 16:39:59 I was told by a BNOC exec in the late ‘70s that far from peak North Sea oil being reached by the end of the 20th century, it would likel be near the end of this century . The lies since have been breathtaking, strangely peaking in Summer 2014 with Ian Wood’s outburst.
6391 2018-11-20 16:39:56 Not everyone can afford a high dollar remover, but baby wipes or just plain vegable oil works great

Ruthlessly eliminating competition is American tradition since 1776. 

If the public doesn't demand better, Monopoly will happen every time.
6398 2018-11-20 16:39:33 The issue is so complex because of Saudi investments and influence due to oil. There’s so many players involved - if Russia and and Saudi become closer friends, it is a national threat to the US. Only way is international comity for a valid solution.
6399 2018-11-20 16:39:33 A more market friendly economy, reduction of debt, etc. will attract investment from China and other sources.  It should be good for oil production too.

6405 2018-11-20 16:38:43 cbd and/or lavender oil? I went through a period like this and melatonin made me feel bad. Feel like I just had to ride it out but u could try just drinking tea, taking epsom salt baths before sleep..

6428 2018-11-20 16:36:39 Hi there Paul. Yes, we do use a small amount of palm oil to make our pastry and at present there are no plans to change this. The oil we use is sourced sustainably, from trusted suppliers that meet a number of principles to ensure this is the case.
6429 2018-11-20 16:36:39 Hypothesizing 50% of dispensaries would recommend for PW before data collection is flawed scientifically.  Grouping together non-psycho active products like CBD oil w/ all “cannabis products” is also flawed.  This also seems to implement a loose definition of marketing as well

6435 2018-11-20 16:36:05 Oil is a resource. A physical thing. Easy enough to say(whine) it's owned by someone. Deficit is a concept. The UK runs itself including Scotland at a deficit. Scotland can't spend more than it receives; it doesn't have borrowing ability.

6525 2018-11-20 16:28:16 Very interesting. I’d assume the rush to Palm oil and all the environmental devastation that followed what is down to the switch from hydrogenated vegetable oil in food products. What % of palm oil goes to biodiesel what % into food products?

6610 2018-11-20 16:20:16 So, I filed comments with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission yesterday. It was the deadline to submit comments on the high level nuclear waste dump planned for Andrews County, Texas.  Gotta Protect the Basin. #PermianBasin #oil
6611 2018-11-20 16:19:59 Majority of 9/11 terrorists were Saudi, bin Laden was Saudi, Saudis are major funders/supporters of terrorism, Saudis intentionally and deliberately tried to destroy US oil industry.  I can go on.  But Eric thinks these are our friends?  His family must be personally benefiting.
6612 2018-11-20 16:19:46 Still doesn't negate the fact that oil companies have gouging Canadians for years.
6613 2018-11-20 16:19:44 sorry to rub it in, but an eighth in Oregon goes for $4-30 bucks from the store. An hour is not too far, but they are capitalizing off of being the only spot around it looks like for those kind of outrageous prices. The store I go to has $1.20 and $2.40 grams and 8$ grams of oil.
6614 2018-11-20 16:19:36 my cars gas tank is roughly 30% gas and 60% Marvel Mystery Oil

not cause the products good (which it is), but because I'm out of gas until 4pm ;p

6616 2018-11-20 16:19:30 @mydrunkelephant I have very sensitive skin that veers dry but unfortunately breaks out if I put anything too heavy on it. Your Marula Oil is a godsend. My skin is drinking it up! And zero breakouts. It will be a staple this winter  #cleanbeauty
6617 2018-11-20 16:19:22 You right it's not expensive now to do a vacay there, the oil find ago tun up tings soon lol
6618 2018-11-20 16:19:18 I didn't realize the scam facebook account and told me to seed in faith for motherless children home in Dakar.  I send $500 after that I realized it is scam.  He demanded $1500 for anointing oil.  
The following are those persons

6622 2018-11-20 16:18:59 Sir, I am an ex-pat in India since 2007, working stimulation projects on both the East & West Coast. I can offer a unique perspective on the declining oil production numbers and how to improve them. I would be honored to do so. The Goal: India Energy Independence

6625 2018-11-20 16:18:48 So would you argue that anything could be considered a piece of art, if it has a meaning or emotions attached to it? Or what about an elaborate oil painting, yet the artist was devoid of any emotion, as it was merely a commission? Would that then not be a piece of art? :)
6626 2018-11-20 16:18:47 The track record of this government for choosing folks to help support our oil and gas sector isn’t fantastic. First they chose Tzeporah Berman, an anti-oil zealot, to Co-Chair their Oil Sands Advisory Group, and now someone who equated AB oil to landmines. Ugh.

6628 2018-11-20 16:18:34 The oil lobby has deep pockets and many willing servants. It's gonna be a tough fight.
6629 2018-11-20 16:18:15 Need I remind u that d looting started way before 1999 and which part of the country have occupied the office more ?? And Mr integrity is doing what about them ?? Or is it the emirs that have oil wells ?? Oga pass d ball to some one else jare make we move on
6630 2018-11-20 16:18:10 Nahhh... D one from oil, u know

6632 2018-11-20 16:17:54 Kalo aku mw-milk cleanser-fw. Tp ada juga yg pake oil cleansing, biar makin bersih
6633 2018-11-20 16:17:42 CBD Oil proven to help too. Like I said above, I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil whiich works great for me.
6634 2018-11-20 16:17:36 Soya bean oil, wheat, maize, fertilizer etc we used to be self sufficient. Commercial agriculture needs to be reestablished without free inputs but as proper agribusiness in designated areas with security of tenure and rule of law. Hazvina kuoma! The will is needed.
6635 2018-11-20 16:17:29 Underrated economic risk: oil price collapse causes another big downturn in fracking like in 2015-16.
6636 2018-11-20 16:17:24 Dude please stop,u are nt making sense ere at all who told u Nigeria is broke? We are not even in a recession & you are saying Nigeria is broke!? That was how you brought a topic that had nothing to do with my point of exporting agro produce & other non oil commodity
6637 2018-11-20 16:17:23 I took a flight today with three bottles of wine, three packs of cheese and olive oil (yes, I was in Italy) in my hold luggage. Arrived to the destination with one less bottle of wine, no bottles of olive oil and one cheese. Bag was closed when I picked it up at baggage claim.
6638 2018-11-20 16:17:19 The point is we don’t get a hometown discount on the oil, the oil is being shipped to foreign markets, refine it in Alberta and sell it in Canada then you might get more support
6639 2018-11-20 16:17:15 No palm oil, but still gonna support the biggest driver of biodiversity loss and deforestation? You guys are full of sh.. 
6640 2018-11-20 16:17:15 Take 5 oil change is convenient but way too expensive and it doesnt even include a filter change.
6641 2018-11-20 16:17:11 My dad really made me go get an oil change BY MYSELF! I’ve never in my years of having a car have had to do it. I’m so bothered 
6642 2018-11-20 16:17:03 I found out this morning that the House is undoing protections for Gray Wolves!  This is horrible & at the rate they are undoing protections for our wildlife so they can drill for oil, is criminal. This admin has undone protections from the majority of US National Parks!
6643 2018-11-20 16:16:57 Day 1:Ans 5 - I love Barbecue because,food cooked in Barbecue is mouthwatering delicious and aromatic flavour is cherry on the cake,also from health perspective it is recommended as much oil is not involved in cooking.

6645 2018-11-20 16:16:49 Oil drops below$55 barrel but still we paid petrol price Rs: 76 per litre despite gov deregulated petrol & disel price.
6646 2018-11-20 16:16:47 All those vape pens, CBD oil, THC oil, old socks, whatever they're "smoking" adds up.
6647 2018-11-20 16:16:45 These squats got me walking like the tin man... body need oil
6648 2018-11-20 16:16:40 Paid for with libyan  and Syrian gas and oil and Afghani opium.
6649 2018-11-20 16:16:39 Oil... tanking again- $54! Motorists- are you tankful yet? National average has JUST slid to $2.599/gal, the lowest since March
6650 2018-11-20 16:16:37 
6651 2018-11-20 16:16:29 How about @JustinTrudeau @GeraldButts advising to stop selling human right violators Saudia Arabia billions of dollars in weapons of war! Shame on us. Canadians vehemently do not support this. We support global human rights not kiss ass to oil barons war criminals. #disgusting
6652 2018-11-20 16:16:18 Our over dependence on oil money isn't healthy. Hence governors should look inward& stop humongous pay of political office holders to accommodate proposed minimum wage. #JH
6653 2018-11-20 16:16:18 Zinc is amazing. I've also tried oil of oregano with success both for sore throat and tummy issues, but usually you have to take it at the first sign of something happening. And it's really quite vile.
6654 2018-11-20 16:16:17 Canada has 3rd largest oil reserves, best environmental standards, but Ont, Que buy Foreign Oil from Killer Saudi’s & Dictators. BC imports fuel from USA while selling Coal to Trump
losing 80 million a day it would give us Rx Drug Plan, Day Care Senior Care, Lower Taxes

6655 2018-11-20 16:16:10 Have you tried baby oil.. that’s my go to to remove makeup
6656 2018-11-20 16:16:10 What made you decide on oil companies?
6657 2018-11-20 16:15:59 Me: Im so Smart!!!!

*One time I used honey instead of oil to cook egg and then I didnt know why the pan was producing bubbles and my egg became sticky. I ended up cooking a new egg afterwards."

6659 2018-11-20 16:15:55 Day 2 of break & babysitting, & 1 kid wakes up with gum in her hair from the other kid & we have no oil or peanut butter what so ever 
6660 2018-11-20 16:15:52 Investors in OMC stocks will enjoy the party. Expect OMCs to spike up 10-15% in tomorrow’s trade with 5% correction in crude oil and appreciating INR to USD. HPCL best stock to ride in this environment.
6661 2018-11-20 16:15:48 Huge volatility indicates a TOP.  Copper, lumber and oil portends recession.
6662 2018-11-20 16:15:43 Remember when you said oil was going to 2k a barrel and then it plummeted to historically low prices haha
6663 2018-11-20 16:15:41 CCX Canadian Crude Oil Index ETF is bottoming hard.

Harder it fall, the faster it bottoms out. Could stay lower than $5 for upto 12
months due to all the new 2019 oil supply coming online first half 2019
$4.65 CAD -$0.32 (-6.44%)
6664 2018-11-20 16:15:30 The Clair field is an important natural resource but it is a lot more complicated than multiplying the oil in place versus what can actually be produced & cost of producing it.  It was discovered in the 1970s but wasn’t developed for nearly 30 years because of cost & difficulty
6665 2018-11-20 16:15:28 @RadioFreeTom he could sell a product literally called "Snake Oil", and these rubes would fight over the privilege to buy it first.
6666 2018-11-20 16:15:26 The inventories will eventually turn bullish as the Saudis have cut back on the sale of oil to the US. I just do not think it will already be reflected tomorrow.
6667 2018-11-20 16:15:23 Rise of the Earth. Oil as something and are the brothers of us.
6668 2018-11-20 16:15:12 Hot rocks, oil, I want it all
6669 2018-11-20 16:15:04 It's an oil by-product that helps bind everything together. The glass is fluffed up to create tiny air pockets. This is a special type of fiberglass.
6670 2018-11-20 16:14:59 Oil market too crashed
6671 2018-11-20 16:14:51 Have you tried CBD Oil? It's proven to help w/seizures. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for Seasonal Affective Disorder, neck/foot/all pain, stress, prevent joint damage/arthritis, sleep. Pharmaceutical Grade/No THC. Works for me!

Mix oatmeal and warm water . Add 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and mix well. Wash your face and neck with warm water then apply mixture and let sit .
6674 2018-11-20 16:14:44 @KnowingBetterYT Seems like you've been flirting with the concept of global oil economics.  Any chance you've done or will do?
6675 2018-11-20 16:14:44 Oil Man went to church with Mars and used their leg as a gun
6676 2018-11-20 16:14:44 They know the truth, they just deny it because of pure GREED - all that matters to them is the accumulation of wealth.
They need to rollback all environmental regulations so lumber/oil/coal etc industries can operate at maximum capacity without restriction.
6677 2018-11-20 16:14:42 Sure that's not baby oil?
6678 2018-11-20 16:14:36 you want a shoulder to be your oil less than medallions of oil mounted on edges of ivory

6682 2018-11-20 16:14:11 The East Texas Oil Museum @kilgorecollege is closed until January for renovations.
6683 2018-11-20 16:14:00 I must disagree. Khashoggi was a Saudi National killed by a Saudi prince on foreign soil. Certainly not our business. Not worth messing up these great oil prices.
6684 2018-11-20 16:14:00 The world  itself is a global village ryt? Have u traveled before? Ur country is blessed with Cocoa, natural mineral resources...name them!! Now God added oil. N now 40billion loan so far with a government under 2yrs? where r we going next. Village? No shit hole 
6685 2018-11-20 16:13:34 Good rant on the Dem election wins as a cause of this market dump. Universal Basic Income, Medicare for All, Free College, Gun Control, demonizing Coal/Oil, more regulations, etc. bankrupts America. Every country uses tariffs. It's time for the US to stop being a sucker @Varneyco
6686 2018-11-20 16:13:33 Markets cn remain irrational till the time they realise. Crude oil supplies wer consistently increased by US Shale cos frm 2014-15 and is expected to surpass 12+ million barrels per day in 2019.This is supply shock. Oil traders wer ignoring this fact & focusssed too much on Iran.
6687 2018-11-20 16:13:19 I love my new car but holy shit this oil change is expensive...... but it’s ok. I love my baby

6690 2018-11-20 16:13:13 If you have had the opportunity to travel through the seas & creeks of the Niger Delta, you will observe that oil sleek and carbon particles has taken over the vast surface of the waters including the air people breathe. This is the unfortunate dilemma people suffer in the region

6693 2018-11-20 16:12:55 The oil companies were the most enthusiastic investors in solar technology, although that changed during the corporate crisis and oil price plunge of the 1980s. But agree that energy austerity was a hard message to sell

6696 2018-11-20 16:12:33 Well said, this sort of thing really gets on my tits. Same with cats. The only time my cat went near water was when he was covered in oil and clearly in distress. It was torture seeing how much he hated it.
6697 2018-11-20 16:12:27 Well I guess they won't be able to say that high oil prices caused this recession.

6703 2018-11-20 16:12:06 Lets say (hypothetically) climate change is 100% fake. Making the switch to renewable energy is still the long term move. The sooner we go all in, the farther ahead we’ll be when oil is scarce on a global level - which will probably be within our lifetimes given current reserves.

6707 2018-11-20 16:11:43 One can already buy the oil for medicinal use online in the UK. There is a huge market. I think you are on track.  More research and analysis required. Not everyone need to make the oil. I understand it's quite a science regarding temperatures etc. But raw material required.
6708 2018-11-20 16:11:35 In all that, he mirrors some of the decisions taken in '85 which he still hasn't accepted were made in error.

Till date, despite noise about diversification, oil as a share of FG income is rising rather than dropping like it did under GEJ.

Their biggest fear is that someone will show it works
Thats why they killed Hugo Chavez-he freed Venezuela from IMF debt- so they got Saudis to sell oil cheap to bankrupt Venezuela

Bizarre non !
6720 2018-11-20 16:10:51 @RazerSupport my phones had another accident, i could deal with the oil in the screen as it levelled out, but stood on it today and now its slightly bent but not cracked, gonna cost me .a fortune? :(
6721 2018-11-20 16:10:49 Because they import oil a lot,that's why i ask..so its depends on the company margin?

6728 2018-11-20 16:10:01 Guess this cycle of price hike, boom for shale oil industry courtesy cheap loans, and then price crashing due to oversupply / slow economic activity leading to lower demand everywhere, will continue in near future.
6729 2018-11-20 16:10:00 Nowadays he's transitioned to sesame oil huh
6730 2018-11-20 16:09:52 Without the oil or goofy hats.

6738 2018-11-20 16:09:19 Copper, Lumber and Oil says differently Mr. Kudlow.  That and the market volatility indicates a TOP.  Stock market is another leading indicator.

All of this portends problems for the Economy AND Trump 2020.

Wow.  He still openly smokes.
6739 2018-11-20 16:09:08 The greenhouse gases released in natural gas are, in the short term, 20 times more potent in contributing to global warming than burning oil.  And transmission systems are notoriously leaky.

6741 2018-11-20 16:08:59 I’m getting an oil change at the dealership and it’s Thanksgiving crowded. So expect lots of weird , pointless tweets in the next couple of hours.

6747 2018-11-20 16:08:23 I’m sitting in a car dealership waiting for an oil change. The View is on the tv but the sound is turned way down. Is M McCain being an ass today too? They’re talking about Ivanka’s email scandal.
6748 2018-11-20 16:08:23 It is plant oil and its composition is similar to the sebum (natural oils) of our skin and thus it is very easily absorbed.

6752 2018-11-20 16:07:57 I’ve heard of that! but I was using jojoba oil and idk if I wasn’t doing it right or if it didn’t work best with that? But I’m gonna do that tonight with olive oil thank you

6754 2018-11-20 16:07:28 .@RachelNotley a special committee for how to raise our oil prices? How much is that going to cost tax payers. The amount we spend on studies and commuters is appalling! I will help for free. PIPELINES, the only way to raise our price is to diversify the # of countries we sell to
6755 2018-11-20 16:07:20 And nobody cares about a party for the media.  More important things to attend to like changing the oil in your car, paying the rent, buying groceries, doctor appointments, etc.  The media?  Who cares except the media?
6756 2018-11-20 16:07:20 Hi, yes, it works. VLCC Bio Elixir Oil works as a 10-in-1 Skin Enhance Oil. Its formulated with the finest natural oils to offer as many as 10 skin benefits. The ingredients not only repair damaged skin but also rejuvenate it.

6772 2018-11-20 16:06:29 So on Sunday I spent 3 plus hours at Walmart for an oil change. Sent a tweet to @walmart and they take a day to reply to my DM, only to tell me it will take 72 hours to respond! Really? "Save money, live better" my ass!

6782 2018-11-20 16:05:33 No...HH will be doing what Balcombe has been doing with 2 months of the well shut in. UKOG just want to keep squeezing some oil out intermittently whilst they wait on a production licence in mid 2020. Very shrewd, but not the volumes you think. Need a licence like Angus for that

6797 2018-11-20 16:04:22 Depends on the popcorn. We have an electric air popper that uses no oil and then we melt butter and pour it over with some salt or whatever you want (Old Bay, Lowry's) and its pretty bomb. Microwave popcorn can fuck right off though.

6812 2018-11-20 16:03:36 Sure but oil exploration & production in swamps and deep water is a technology we don't have because of the kind of government we have. The problem is systematic because our institutions that should provide these technologies are comatose due to deliberate political decisions.

6817 2018-11-20 16:03:25 No doubt it reflects lobbying power, but I know CU’s consumption is so great they recently built an oil/natural gas dual fire cogeneration plant at Manhattanville for which Cuomo issued bonds.
6818 2018-11-20 16:03:10 No. Those are thicker oils and are different consistency. Try the ones in the tube normal castor oil and argan oil my go to.
6819 2018-11-20 16:03:05 Some 50 North American and 35 Argentine cos. discussed plans recently for joint work in Argentina's #Vacamuerta formation.  Big oil seems to have temporarily (for how long?) abandoned heavy oil and EHCO dreams in the #Faja to chase unconventional shale gas in #Neuquén.

6941 2018-11-20 15:52:47 Don't think oil price will be very low again, unless OPEC are really stupid by not cutting enough supply.
When people say we are in new normal, then we really are heading toward it.

In oil, it used to be OPEC and Russia but now it is three men's world.

Oil prices fall to a new one-year low amid concerns about rising global supplies and growing fears of an economic slowdown. 

Arre Bhaiya on 4th of October Brent was at $ 86. In one month how can the "fears of slowdown" grow so much without any supporting data.
6971 2018-11-20 15:51:03 I followed OS for 2 years. What happened to their Oil positions? He was predicting Oil to drop under USD 70 and apparently this did happen. Appreciate if you can share what went wrong with their Oil positions? Thank you
6972 2018-11-20 15:50:58 Tread carefully.  The countries' interests are intertwined when it comes to trade and oil and the fight against an expanding Iran.   The Saudi Arabia & US relationship is not built on shared Democratic values. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy and religiously conservative.

6978 2018-11-20 15:50:51 Canadians are unfortunately unable to understand this, or the fact that we are selling our oil to the US for $14, and the US turns around and then sells OUR OIL on the world market for $50+, while doing absolutely nothing for it. It is insane. But, not a word out of the public.

6985 2018-11-20 15:50:25 A incerteza quanto ao interesse da Rússia, em reduzir a produção, dificultando um novo corte conjunto de oil, pela OPEP+, ajuda a explicar a queda forte do oil, hoje. Fora, a desaceleração no mundo ex-EUA, que reduz a demanda por oil.
6986 2018-11-20 15:50:24 Quem Dita preço de oil são os Americanos e os Árabes (oferta) e com menos influencia a China (demanda). Mas com a queda do petróleo ao nível de US$50 que acho que deverá ficar bom tempo, forçará a Petrobras e o governo federal a tomar alguma atitude drástica.

6992 2018-11-20 15:49:59 Oil sands oil is some of the dirtiest oil in the world that is harder to process, that’s why it undersells.
6993 2018-11-20 15:49:56 Irrelevant. Your usage of it would suggest that you just want to shut down that portion of the debate and I think you are better than that . . . even if you can be an insufferable pencil necc'd snake oil salesman.

Brent close to $80 ($63.7)

7168 2018-11-20 15:36:53 At the second Multi-Stakeholders’ Workshop on Sustainable Palm Oil Development in Edo State, I called on the Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA) to expedite action on the Forestry Commission Bill to give legal backing to efforts at managing our forest resources~GGO

7173 2018-11-20 15:36:37 Arabs have no respect for human life, unevolved untermenchen. Look at the pali’s and the savage killing by the Crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Who would trust this uncivilized behaviour? They have oil and sand but need to evolve.
7174 2018-11-20 15:36:32 It's the conviction he has describing the player. It's like the girl your parents don't want you to date but you keep telling them why they're so great. 
This is not only comical....it's embarrassing.

7177 2018-11-20 15:36:06 I would like to add that it's a VERY bad move to alienate THE customer group that actually gives a crap about the environment. If going palm oil free (which WE celebrated from day 1) was for the environment, then WE were the people to aim for. Animal ag. is destroying the planet.

7184 2018-11-20 15:35:50 But OPEC+ said they would be monitoring the oil markets and avoid volatility.....It seems we are living extreme volatility like we saw in the 2008-2009 years?? So what has changed?
7185 2018-11-20 15:35:46 You could shove a couple of OTC EPA+DHA fish oil pills up your behind and then come back with a new article on the effects (and maybe even some#fakenews sprinkled in)

7193 2018-11-20 15:35:29 Little worrisome that oil didn’t bounce more after that 12 session losing streak. Could take a little shot here at $54 but eventually more pain for the longs is possible.
7194 2018-11-20 15:35:27 I fear that Cenovus equity will be worthless soon. There is no way they can pay off their massive debts with $50 oil and $30 differentials. That's way they seemed so panicked right now, the writing is on the wall. I'm not short or long, just an observer. $cve

7198 2018-11-20 15:35:21 Bollox. The £ was Scotland’s currency first - England adopted it. They can buy us out of our share anytime they like.

And the Uk is a Unitary market - not a single market. Scotland doesn’t ‘export’ to England - if it did, we’d keep oil revenues north of the border.
7199 2018-11-20 15:35:20 The reality is, a lot of oil and gas are in shitty places with sketchy govts.  Americans corps are not allowed to bribe, the rest of the world does.  Often these shitty countries require the competent US company partner with a local company, and have some local “investors”

7203 2018-11-20 15:35:13 Simple.  Use a cast iron pan. Heat up some olive oil and garlic. Chop up bacon and fry. Take it out.  Slice Brussels sprouts in half. Let them go for a while. Add back the bacon, sprinkle with lots of Parmesan cheese. Cook a few more mins. Enjoy.

7212 2018-11-20 15:34:22 It sounds like there may be some doves on the FOMC now.  Falling oil prices should ease inflation fears. #oneandwait.

7230 2018-11-20 15:33:03 It's only when people like you and Andurand throw in the towel that oil stocks will start to go back up. Same happened to Andy Hall. He finally called it quits and then oil shot up. This pain will continue to happen until the last bull capitulates.
7231 2018-11-20 15:32:55 Exactly.. That’s why I stop taking my car to them but they got the best deal on the oil change

7248 2018-11-20 15:31:48 I never understood oil relation with RIL. RIL is primarily refining company, I have seen them increasing refining margin in high and low oil scenarios
7249 2018-11-20 15:31:45 Walls haven't really never worked. Not in China, not in Berlin, and not in Israel. They won't work here, either. They'll hand more human trafficking power to cartels, while ignoring visa overstays that really drive illegal immigration. Billions spent for nothing; snake oil.

Am certain that over 90% of that figure is from southerners overseas! Again, the North needs to have a reckoning sucking d teat of d Fed not recommended.

7388 2018-11-20 15:22:21 Look at all the hidden cost that statement requires, oil (and all its costs), roads, parking, pollution, time, the list goes on and on. But we've spent decades reinforcing this into the culture.
7389 2018-11-20 15:22:17 Does this rhyme with late 2015-2016?  Oil drop, 4 rate hikes expected in '16, China slowing, high yield energy credit threat to banks...  Tech stocks held up into end of '15 but most stocks already down 10%+.  Techs broke in early '16, sending the indexes down.  1 hike in '16.
7390 2018-11-20 15:22:15 Are you suggesting that global oil markets are the responsibility of Canadian governments? How does our management of oil sands affect its market value, compared to the inherent costs of upgrading and refining bitumen vs conventional oil?

7407 2018-11-20 15:21:06 Yet gasoline (though somewhat lower than a month ago) has not dropped a commensurate amount. Further proof that oil companies do not operate in a "free market" as they represent, but rather in an artificial one, created by oil-friendly politicians and subsidized by taxpayers.

7410 2018-11-20 15:21:01 The key to any replacement fuel for fossil fuels is its cost and reliability. If hydrogen can be produced and distributed cheaper that oil, gas or coal the market will make the switch without subsidies or government mandates. Everyone will benefit.

7446 2018-11-20 15:18:40  Even "not detrimental" is already a health achievement nowadays. But I see it mostly as a robust option for frying and to bring in fat (in a LCHF context). Plus I do like the taste, provided it is a quality olive oil. I'm rather agnostic concerning its direct health benefits.
7447 2018-11-20 15:18:32 Panas wehhhh. Kalau oil serious relaxing
7448 2018-11-20 15:18:26 absolutely, the QE anthology stoked commodities hard!  At the same time it stoked shale oil drilling (fueled by debt) and subsequently led the oil price to collapse.  no matter what the nice thing about a recession is it drop kicks the Demand of S/D for every commodity
7449 2018-11-20 15:18:18 Probably, yes. But as we know, oil should v little impact on 10-year inflation expectations.....
7450 2018-11-20 15:18:09 Will be passing on the lone NHL game tonight.  Have to think the oil get out of this rut at some point but not likely it will be tonight.  However, I’m not confident enough in San Jose to lay that much.  

A couple plays on the hard court will be sent out. 
7451 2018-11-20 15:18:07 The holy trifecta. World didn’t end at the 2008 financial crisis or 2000 dotcom crash because oil was high. Interesting to see what happens next. Better stock on rice, seeds, and beans in the meantime.

7457 2018-11-20 15:17:50 @KenyanTraffic according to latest reports the price of Oil has fallen by 3% to drop below $55 per barrel. Am thinking out loud here @UKenyatta when will our prices reflect the same despite the 8% VAT you imposed?!
7458 2018-11-20 15:17:49 Even if this was a good move, it is coming from the wrong Presidential candidate and in a wrong economy.  He is already a suspect because of the history of Privatization in Nigeria -- not that Privatization in itself is bad.  But lets face it, oil is no longer our best asset

7462 2018-11-20 15:17:25 90% of Venezuelans do mind and want the US to get their hands on Venezuelan oil as long as there is food and meds in the country. A Marine invasion would be gladly welcomed by the vast majority in Venezuela.

How do you make people who are conditioned like that from birth to realize? They are more interested in heaven than living on earth
7469 2018-11-20 15:16:46 Because most people want the non-foaming property and don't care about the additives. Foaming hot oil is dangerous, after all.

7502 2018-11-20 15:14:17 Arms sales, oil, Trump's inexplicable concupiscence for murderous autocrats, and the naive hope for an effective counterbalance to Iran are the most obvious reasons.
7503 2018-11-20 15:14:17 But that's just how things are supposed to be. Buy low, sell high. How else os world going to survive when the oil barrel is at $200 per barrel. It would be so chaotic for humanity to survive.

7570 2018-11-20 15:10:39 I guess I'd agree with Trump. US doesn't need oil much longer - so it's about controlling the oil tap for China. But you don't need KSA for that. Just impose selective blockade via the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca.

7588 2018-11-20 15:09:36 Hi Jason, we’ve never used palm oil in our chocolate, yet small amounts come indirectly from added ingredients, such as biscuits. In all cases our suppliers are RSPO certified which guarantees the palm oil we use is sustainably sourced. Part 1/2

Trump was elected via hatred...and also Big Cattle, Big Sheep, Big Oil,  Big Gas,  Big Pharma, Big Insurance,  Monsanto/Bayer stock holders. He was elected by greedy bigots.

7595 2018-11-20 15:09:18 Sustainable production and consumption is the solution. @EPOA_EU EPOA and its members support the move to 100% sustainable palm oil import for food in Europe by 2020! @wef @palmedurable @RSPOtweets

7597 2018-11-20 15:09:12 Its really a shame to PDP that wit all the money made during oil boom could not point to any project of note. even IBB that we all thought was the father of corruption was able to give us 3rd mainland bridge wit money made from oil boom during his tenure.

7601 2018-11-20 15:08:45 Hey @RGAM007 ! You were looking towards the US. That is the Anacortes shipping lanes. And again, that is not the same waters or the same coast that the oil tankers out of Westridge would be traveling, if we allowed it. It has little to do with the Anacortes. #Geography101

7604 2018-11-20 15:08:31 Antarctica is an international zone, just like outer space and the ocean, it is considered as part of the common heritage of mankind, meaning that it should be preserved immaculately for all future generations, forever.... until they find oil underneath it and all goes to hell.
7605 2018-11-20 15:08:30 All renewable technology should be considered along with #rainwaterharvesting. The rest of the world is so far ahead of the UK it is quite sad to think that all these technologies which have been in place for ages are being overlooked

7611 2018-11-20 15:08:08 Please, please, please, Gareth, stop using sunflower oil or any other vegetable oil. It's heart disease in a bottle and overloaded with highly unstable, rancid polyunsaturates and omega 6 fatty acids.  Olive oil, lard, beef tallow are all stable oils that don't easily oxidize.

Ohio also had something far more important to the economy 200 years ago alot connections to rivers and canals that were the engines of commerce. This is why Cleveland, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh grew so fast long ago.

7674 2018-11-20 15:04:33 Yeah. He didn't do it in the light of day, so good luck proving it. But, back during the Harper regime there was a coordinated effort to harm the Russian economy by playing politics with the price of oil.

7735 2018-11-20 15:00:27 Just why the heck not. Happy to hear if there is a reason but I hear none.

Betting on the collective history of wives tales saying fish oil is good.

7738 2018-11-20 15:00:02 So, how much fun will a Saudi civil war be for oil prices?  If the Trump Admin were to take a stand against MBS, it would probably force his replacement as Crown Prince, as advocated by some of the Royal Family.  If the US remains silent, Saudi Arabia is a powder keg.
7739 2018-11-20 15:00:01 markets are an absolute disaster this morning but likely to close above these current lows.  With oil down over 2%, Dow quickly heading towards 2%, the TSE eyeing -1.5%, closing above these numbers is the least one could hope for.
7740 2018-11-20 15:00:00 When you consider that Scottish oil has funded projects like the channel tunnel, the m25, high speed rail link, trident, and vanity projects like the millennium dome. Not forgetting tax breaks for mega rich. All London centric. Wales & rural parts of UK have suffered too.
7741 2018-11-20 14:59:56 But they have oil so we love em.

7743 2018-11-20 14:59:44 Hello Nils. Rapeseed requires more land to produce the same yield as palm oil, therefore increase in demand would lead to an increase in the amount of land needing to be used 1/2

7745 2018-11-20 14:59:35 I'm allergic to tea tree oil. So I have to check for it in everything. That just means I actually check for it in everything. I don't freak out on companies that use it.
7746 2018-11-20 14:59:32 WTI crude oil back to $55
7747 2018-11-20 14:59:32 Trust the oil of the future
7748 2018-11-20 14:59:31 Call me weird but I hope my wife lets me oil her scalp in the future lol ... all she gotta do is ask and I got scalp and full body massages everyday
7749 2018-11-20 14:59:29 Disgusting rhetoric! What expose are you talking about? All shops have high prices kumusha or in town. And it's not their problem. Ungataure zve fuel nana gogo vekumusha? Taura zve cooking oil, sugar, soap, etc.

Your Mberengwa stunt is thuggery and shameful. Do that in OK tione

7751 2018-11-20 14:59:26 I don't have eczema but I have dry flaky patchy skin, you could try a blend of argan oil, avocado oil, Shea butter, Mango butter and olive oil. Anything that works for you
7752 2018-11-20 14:59:20 give 'em the ol' broken finger/hurm and ronch at 'em/how can they see with hot oil in their eyes?/what if your actions are unlawful/what if your smell is frankly awful/razzle dazzle 'em/whisper 'no' to their cries
7753 2018-11-20 14:59:19 I don't disagree w/your opinion on currency. In fact, I believe you are mostly correct. 

It is not why we were "taught to hate Islam."

"Islam" is a problem for other reasons. 

I agree it is truly abt currency and oil. All. Of. It. Middle-East issue...not Islam.

I am awake.
7754 2018-11-20 14:59:18 Because they got stung (purposefully imo) when the oil price fell in 2015

7762 2018-11-20 14:58:22 There are PLENTY of examples of what happens when a democratic system, employs “Socialist” philosophies -Venezuela: government took over oil production & companies left (w/foreign investment); corruption,which goes with government controls, than took over. 
Done.
7763 2018-11-20 14:58:21 I love being able to split my day between magazine work, video work, packaging merchandise and carrying out an oil change on the 2CV. It's 3pm I feel like I've done about a million things! This calls for tea.

7767 2018-11-20 14:57:45 Jews yes, Muslim's yes coz they have oil in their countries.  Christians? Unless they're pastors

7770 2018-11-20 14:57:17 Musta gotten the baby oil on your new boots. I told ya ya had too much on but noooooo......now ya slipped and nearly broke something. If you'd fallen you'd have been out for 3 months. You know if you breathe wrong you injure something. There should be a geriatric division...
7771 2018-11-20 14:57:15 The next step is to drive a renewed commitment from all players across the palm oil supply chain to  achieve market transformation.
7772 2018-11-20 14:57:12 use a non stick pan. Oil problem solved.
7773 2018-11-20 14:56:58 @byronvids sniffing @formoftherapy is real life. How many times have my best friend and I just sniffed each other because they smelled good?

Also, I vouch for body oil. Lavender keeps bugs away. 

You’re welcome. 
7774 2018-11-20 14:56:57 In the latest three months, the international futures price of crude oil exceeded USD 70 and USD 80 sequentially.

7776 2018-11-20 14:56:28 I need an oil change, tune up and air in my tires. Lemme call my daddy 
7777 2018-11-20 14:56:19 Oil is drying up & at the current trends will be more precious than gold in a decade, unless We demand alternative fuels. The effects of pollution are everywhere & like with the cleanup of the Great Lakes, only people can correct it. Just their story shows how much man can harm
7778 2018-11-20 14:56:17 I need to change my oil like yesterday or my engine is gonna blow...

7782 2018-11-20 14:55:47 -Wash it with acne face wash. Again avoid the ones with oils in them. In fact many of them have the words; “OIL FREE” written in big and bold letters on the container. There are also wipes and they will also help you.
-Pin your hair back, both during the day and during the night.
7783 2018-11-20 14:55:37 Oil change and got a new battery and tires...this car better not need nothing else until it’s paid off

7785 2018-11-20 14:55:26 Hi Ian, sustainable palm oil is grown according to RSPO's Principles and Criteria. Members recently voted to strengthen these criteria to include:  #NoDeforestation via @HighCarbonStock Approach + a strict ban on new development of #peat soils and many more.
7786 2018-11-20 14:55:21 Same here...Hate milk...And yes grains are the root cause of gaining weight...Make your meal gluten free...Completely agree on ekadashi fast... Best is to try sobji siddho or copy the food eaten by our grand mothers...Pure simple low oil veg food with only tumeric and rock salt
7787 2018-11-20 14:55:18 Hate waiting over an hour for a damn oil change 
7788 2018-11-20 14:55:06 Didn't know my skin was this sensitive  I shd have had this coming because same shit happen when i tried bio oil.
7789 2018-11-20 14:55:05 Oil rigs is that actual answer you're looking for.
7790 2018-11-20 14:55:01 I remember when hoffman was with sens and the possibility of him leaving everybody including me was saying go after him speedy sniper LW...didnt cost florida or san jose alot. Defiantly chia COULD have done. My oil rant of the morning
7791 2018-11-20 14:54:59 Matt stitched together more decent piece this time. No major complaints from me. On other hand, Kaiser Health News "piece" this AM w/ same glaring omission that others have made. Quotes Nissen as simply conducting fish oil study of his own without mention of PI, AZN or product.
7792 2018-11-20 14:54:58 I'd care more if they stopped using palm oil.
7793 2018-11-20 14:54:57 Spreads widening, oil down.
7794 2018-11-20 14:54:54 I can respect that.  Personally I would just infuse oil or butter at that point and forgo the tincture, but that is personal preference as I really dislike the taste of glycerin tinctures I have had.
7795 2018-11-20 14:54:50 I'm in Alberta. Wonderful economy you say?
We are recovering, but without a valid market for oil, we will keep selling it the the US at pennies on the dollar...  and the recovery here will remain stalled.

Not everyone is in Ontario and BC.  Not everyone has an economic recovery.

7797 2018-11-20 14:54:42 A number of MPs who also spoke in this energy debate by @claireperrymp , also mentioned why all new homes could not be installed during build time with a solar system. My veiw is that any mention of solar will relate to ONLY solar PV, not thermal or PVT, as to complicated
7798 2018-11-20 14:54:37 It's the way forward man, I've lost count of how many people have told me they've started using cannabis oil as pain relief and it's pretty much changed their life. Ridiculous that we're still in the 19th century and banning this shit.
7799 2018-11-20 14:54:23 actually we are producing oil in 2018 and all through the rest of 2018 and 2019 at least until the drilling begins in Q3 2019
7800 2018-11-20 14:54:16 I called my grandpa to get help getting my oil changed and his hearing is hard so now I’m taking my grandparents to lunch today I guess

7807 2018-11-20 14:53:25 Imagine what the world would have been like if oil had never been discovered.
7808 2018-11-20 14:53:19 How would y’all prefer I use coconut oil in the products?
7809 2018-11-20 14:53:14 Your oil change will be done in 40 mins. That was 45 mins ago. @jayauto
7810 2018-11-20 14:53:11 But everybody knows it’s coming. If the world knew today the supply of oil would exactly cut in half in 2 years, what do you think would happen to the price of oil today?
7811 2018-11-20 14:52:50 1 teaspoon of black seed oil and maca root/ginger tea every morning.
7812 2018-11-20 14:52:43 I sometimes forget that taste even exists, I've been using olive oil primarily for so long. It makes butter a revelation, again and again. The lesser flavor of vanilla is definitely a plus - and there's that higher smoke point, too. :)
7813 2018-11-20 14:52:40 Glycerine tinctures are gross & unhealthy as a daily medicine. Qwet extraction then add carrier oil to personal dose.

I'm not obsessed with just anyone's sausage, I'm obsessed with YOUR sausage, and I wouldn't mind seeing you oil yourself all the way down and give us a full-body shot. Come on, you talk way too much and say very little, but I bet your oiled up hog is hot.
7816 2018-11-20 14:52:10 ...how did you make yours that was so hard? We make ours each time we cook gumbo but it's not a chore...just stirring flour in oil until it's dark enough.

Was trying to figure out how to use zest for the infusion. Solved and elegant.
I use the ISI for lemon infused olive oil. 
3 T. and 2 cups of oil. 
Almost as good -- almost -- as cold pressed together pricey oil.

7829 2018-11-20 14:51:16 Okay, let's call it Canada's oil, now more than ever you're being ridiculous, so you hate Canada's dirty oil. You'd rather foreign oil over Canada's dirty oil. See what your saying? One minute dirty Alberta oil, the next dirty Canadian oil. Which is it chump? It can't be both.
7830 2018-11-20 14:51:11 Done the exact same thing ie. not given any deal that was more beneficial than being in the union. 

Now that and extra £5billion worth of oil has been found off the shetlands I would wager that they won’t want to give that away. We will see, 2nd Indy ref ASAP please. 

7831 2018-11-20 14:51:09 Hypocrisy....they stopped producing products with Palm Oil but did not stop selling brands that contain palm oil as an ingredient, palm oil can also be named as vegetable oil, you should be worrying about plastic recycling and biodegradable plastic as well as eradicating...
7832 2018-11-20 14:50:55 Notley started the whole debacle the O&G industry currently faces.The No Domestic Products party went after EVERY natural resource in AB(now, they're doing the same in BC)to kill these industries(oil,gas,coal,farming,etc). She is the queen of the Noticeably Dumb People party!
7833 2018-11-20 14:50:53 Update, from Husky Energy, on #oil spill off #NewfoundlandandLabrador.
(Estimated as largest in province's history.)
"Subsea surveys confirmed a separated weak link at South White Rose Extension Drill Centre as the source of the spill."
Husky says no further leakage observed.
7834 2018-11-20 14:50:52 I once had a guy in Detroit quote me an oil change @ $200 (standard oil) - I said nope & he asked me what I’m used to paying. I said $40, he said “we can do that” I left.

7836 2018-11-20 14:50:35 Hi, Charlotte. There is often contamination in our bins so we're looking at alternatives. We only use RSPO certified sources of palm oil and our Food Team is working hard to reduce our use of palm oil. We hope this helps to reassure you!

Also if that count is complete, it's 10g/d per pump, which is huge. I can understand them doing it. 

I used to say that oil was the only thing protecting Vz's forests. It just wasn't worth it to go log mahogany or dig for flecks of gold while there were oil jobs.

7870 2018-11-20 14:46:04 So a naturally occurring oilsands is dirty? You can literally have the oil squish up around your boots walking the muskeg, but somehow this is dirty? Admit your hatred and bias against Alberta, you're part of the problem not the solution. Sorry you call yourself Canadian.

7872 2018-11-20 14:45:47 I’m still alive but I’m barely breathing
7873 2018-11-20 14:45:46 I used merderma on all my largest scars, and then when they faded I used bio oil to keep things smooth
7874 2018-11-20 14:45:44 You need an oil burner too
7875 2018-11-20 14:45:44 Ah, you mean where the Americans interfered and stopped them selling their oil ! mainstay of their economy?

7885 2018-11-20 14:44:49 Don't doubt for a second that the FDA won't send $AMRN back to the drawing board due to mineral oil effect on outcomes. Even with "approval" and the SPA if the FDA sees a peculiar outcome like this they will tell them to redo trials. FDA moves the goal posts all the time.

7888 2018-11-20 14:44:12 yes concerns are warranted. I use this natural solution for keeping mice out of my seasonal camper: peppermint essential oil; drip onto cotton balls in open glass containers (small jars, glasses or votive candle holders). Mice hate the smell so it keeps them away. Non toxic!
7889 2018-11-20 14:44:11 I really liked your take here @FredericLambert! They see a threat and they try to stop it the most blatant way. They truly should be ashamed of the doing. I really hope US folks go on the streets to fight this - oil game vs the health of US citizens is over!
7890 2018-11-20 14:44:00 Morally, yes, because any money spent on Iranian or Saudi Arabian oil just goes to feeds wars that kill thousands and displace millions, as well as the exportation of the ideology of War and Intolerance.
7891 2018-11-20 14:43:50 Today in Parliment @claireperrymp stated that when the old FIT solar programe ends in April, a new micro renewble programe will be anounced. From what I could understand from what Clair said, was the new programe would only benifit households, as should have been from day one.

7901 2018-11-20 14:42:37 Eh, they’re old people set in their old ways. They pretty well were taught that kissing a booboo makes it feel better and snake oil treats colds overnight. The human anatomy isn’t built to recover from scrapes, bumps and illnesses on its own overnight. It takes time to heal
7902 2018-11-20 14:42:31 Could be money. The Kochs managed to convince DNC to accept oil money b4 the midterms. We're theorizing he was approached as well. Susan Collins was bought off by a 5 million dollar bribe from them. Why not him too?

7905 2018-11-20 14:42:16 And now Exonn and other oil companies advocating for a price on carbon (one that will hurt coal but not oil and gas of course) in return want immunity from prosecution in the USA on willingly advancing CC pollution and misinformation around CC.
7906 2018-11-20 14:42:15 The greatest dish for Thanksgiving Day is baked sweet potatoes. No marshmallows, no brown sugar, just the real thing. Next is sautéed spinach with a little bit of garlic and olive oil. The rest is ok, but those two are essential. And pecan pie.

100% of Scotland's Oil Revenue goes to Westminster

Westminster then decides how much of it they will allow us to have back

7927 2018-11-20 14:40:54 $AMRN R-IT was an **OUTCOMES** cvot. So either mineral oil is responsible for 20% more CV death or EPA is responsible for 20% fewer. PERIOD. @matthewherper  I ask if you, Mr. M.O. Controversy, believe mineral oil is responsible for any CV deaths?
7928 2018-11-20 14:40:51 Cotton and cocoa used to be the world's precious mines before oil was found. In this new century technology is the game changer. We need to drive our economic indicators in the right direction.
7929 2018-11-20 14:40:47 Hi there, Where possible, we are looking to avoid using palm oil in products. We would also like to assure you that any product we stock that do contain palm oil, require a valid RSPO certificate to ensure it is sourced sustainably. Thank you for your tweet

7937 2018-11-20 14:40:22 The Americans market is nearly self sufficient in their needs for crude oil. So, sending oil to Minnesota instead of Texas has a slight displacement on their internal procurement of crude oil, but the overall need for crude oil has not changed.

7954 2018-11-20 14:38:46 There’s also, of course, a climate angle to this too. Clearing debt and tuition debt payments is one way to create funds for households to pursue viral retrofits needed for decarbonization, eg the shift away from fuel oil for home heating in the NE.

8010 2018-11-20 14:32:57 They have already raised height of Oil rigs to safeguard against Sea Level rise while also simultaneously funding Anti Climate Change propaganda. What will they answer to their descendants suffering from Lung problems, health issues & lower quality of life due to pollution.
8011 2018-11-20 14:32:52 Oil your scalp, a buildup buster, and a good conditioner, then I mix water, mixed chicks curl enhancer, curls blueberry leave in, and Shea moisture Max holding gel in a spray bottle. It’s the bomb and smells so good
8012 2018-11-20 14:32:47 Their solution will be to shut down the oil industry so there is no gap.
8013 2018-11-20 14:32:38 If Nigeria worked they’ll be more money for the elite. Like I don’t think the politicians grasp this. Look at the UAE and India... all their leaders are multi billionaires bcs of the revenue generated just from oil and tourism sectors.

8030 2018-11-20 14:30:41 #RSPO is no guarantee of sustainability. Voluntary scheme run by palm oil companies. Work by NGOs has eventually led to delisting rouge companies, only to be rapidly reinstated. Buy @SumaWholefoods PB instead. Just peanuts. Yum.
8031 2018-11-20 14:30:40 @AndrewBellBNN  Nice going Andy another intelligent well informed discussion on the oil discount,  you have the babbling fool Erlichman trying to compare oil companies to drug cartels,  your contribution  " well back in the 60's ",  heavy oil for ships,  what a pair.

8036 2018-11-20 14:30:24 Sorry but once again  everything is all talk we knew long before the pipeline was rejected that Canada was losing BIG time on our oil.
Got the pipeline built as all the "conversations" in the world will not get a better price and to build refineries take too much time and money.

8040 2018-11-20 14:30:20 Does anyone know how long pesto lasts in the fridge after opening? I’ve had it for 3-4 weeks now and there’s a part that isn’t covered in oil...
8041 2018-11-20 14:30:18 Coconut oil works! Great hair mask too!
8042 2018-11-20 14:30:14 Irrelevant wrt sales numbers of EV vs ICE vehicles. In the EU subsidies are lower and governments more than recoup the subsidies through taxes.

So, big oil earns too much, but overall petrol doesn't have a competitive advantage as far as car buyers are concerned.
8043 2018-11-20 14:30:08 SNOPES?  Really???  The American people put more trust in snake oil salesmen than they do in Snopes.
8044 2018-11-20 14:29:59 I hope our grandchildren can afford the cost of buying oxygen mask or oxygen for breathing ! That will be the case if we follow down the path laid by the Oil Industry. They might even start a company selling Air purifiers and Oxygen masks !

8048 2018-11-20 14:29:44 It's too simplistic to say "we'll use oil money to fix everything", that's not how economies work. Believe me, volume is meaningless. It's a PowerPoint undergrad-like presentation. It presents no case studies, no soundly proven methods. It was designed assuming we're fools.

8068 2018-11-20 14:27:56 as at February,  crude oil price was around 34 dollars, but today its at 65 dollars per barrel. Where are all this money going to?
8069 2018-11-20 14:27:51 Market must be left alone. Trudeau’s interference by canceling N Gateway making Energy East impossible by over regulation and nationalizing TM has done permanent much damage to our oil sector.

I'm sorry, when was that? Price per barrel was more than $100 when Modi started. Now it's only $70. I'm sure you know the fuel prices when he started and now.
8100 2018-11-20 14:25:01 Oh just stop the highly inflated oil/gas game. The real per barrel price is $24.00 and artificial uptick is horrible.

8106 2018-11-20 14:24:26 @amberkanwar In a word, it is "irresponsible" of you to suggest that oil markets aren't working because Canadian oil supply and demand aren't in balance.  Producers only invest in new pipelines when the cost of that new pipe < the marginal benefit.
8107 2018-11-20 14:24:24 Oil need to follow suit!!!!
8108 2018-11-20 14:24:22 Alberta just invented a new meme, the "Air Barrel" #AirBarrel is a term when a broker or producer books pipeline space for transporting oil that they don't use. This destroys the competition who needs to sell a barrel but cannot due to competing against an Air BBL

8140 2018-11-20 14:20:17 4x as important in terms of trade to Scotland? DON'T TALK RUBBISH! In the EU we will have TWENTY SEVEN other countries to trade with!! So you won't want our water? Energy? Oil? Gas? etc?! Fair enough...  Away ye go... 
8141 2018-11-20 14:20:15 Easy now. Standard Oil was 2% of the Country's GDP by itself. 

Rockefeller destroyed the ENTIRE TRAIN ECONOMY by himself when he pulled oil from the trains and used a pipeline instead. 

I agree with your main thrust, but maybe comparing to Standard Oil is not quite right.
8142 2018-11-20 14:20:13 @PypAyurved Why Shishu baby hair oil is not available in the market?  Is the production stopped 
8143 2018-11-20 14:20:06 Supplements such as Fish Oil and Vitamin D fall short of expectations.
8144 2018-11-20 14:20:00 Price of oil clearly hurting it when really it shouldn’t be at $55
8145 2018-11-20 14:19:55 Exxon slips after Raymond James downgrades as among least appealing plays on bullish oil call
8146 2018-11-20 14:19:47 Kinda makes you wonder why they want to keep us (oil)  when every day Westminster wakes up and thinks (oil) "Let's give the sweaties (oil) an extra £35.6MILLION today (oil) like we do every single (oil) day (oil) of the year, just cos we like them so (oil) much"
8147 2018-11-20 14:19:44 Morphes shadows do stain tbh. Especially the pinks and purples. All you need to do is use an oil based cleanser and it comes off lol
8148 2018-11-20 14:19:33 I've heard of people doing this and not getting results. I've also hear lavender oil, in a carrier oil, rubbed over body, can help detox from heavy metals but you might want to check that. Someone put it on me age 13 and I got a migraine from the smell so be careful

8154 2018-11-20 14:18:57  If Atiku & T.Y Danjuma mean well for Nigeria they should sell 90% of their oil well in the Niger-delta not NNPC.
8155 2018-11-20 14:18:34 DAH?  And everyother president too?  They funded the 911 terrorists?  It started with oil . Now its investments. If Iran got in bed with some corporations they would be welcome too. MONEY its all America stands for today. Sad!
8156 2018-11-20 14:18:24 Food & Drug admin: Clean up our food and water that’s giving us cancer.

8157 2018-11-20 14:18:22 @cspanwj  So what’s the next product KNOW IT ALL GOVERNMENT WILL GO AFTER, tobacco , oil , speech   what next
8158 2018-11-20 14:18:19 What do you think Was it easy for Indians to go against the US sanctions on Iran. India needed the Iranian oil they went for it. Despite of being the close allies of US. One has to work for its own interest as well. Now is the best time since all are on the same page this time.

8166 2018-11-20 14:17:36 An oil rig in Lake Pigneur pierced the top of the salt dome beneath the island #OTD in 1980. The freshwater lake completely drained within a few hours. The Delcambre Canal reversed flow and two days later the previous freshwater lake was a 1,300-foot-deep saltwater lake.
8167 2018-11-20 14:17:32 well I feel like I should get my car checked on more than just when I get an oil change, which is twice in a 1 month period lol that’s really it.
8168 2018-11-20 14:17:18 'Thank You ' would have sufficed though.

8188 2018-11-20 14:15:33 There is a strong groundswell in Alberta that will be taking it's lead from the next federal election. If junior is re-elected the oil and gas people will get vocal and active. There is a sense of doom amongst lifelong oil people and while their patient, they're not passive.
8189 2018-11-20 14:15:33 What goes in favour for next bull markets, #DollarIndex #oil #mutualfunds inflows of 8000cr a month, pessimism across the board, what goes negative, is #Faang fall, which in infact positive.

8198 2018-11-20 14:14:56 It took a long time before justice caught up with tobacco companies but in the end the results will be the same for the NRA and oil companies both of whom are liars and are complicit.

8200 2018-11-20 14:14:43 lol okay I don’t know if any of that needs to be done but I know I don’t need an oil change. maybe I’ll just go up to the dealership instead of tryna schedule something since idk what I need.

I'm not just ethically opposed to it, I'm allergic to it as well and it makes life very difficult.

8234 2018-11-20 14:11:08 Why not make larger planes and cheeper fuel, open the wells and lets pump some oil
8235 2018-11-20 14:10:59 Honestly, it depends on who is at the store. When I go I get Valvoline, but when my dad goes he gets whatever. I just need a high mileage oil because I drive 500 miles on one tank

8276 2018-11-20 14:07:04 It is worth remembering that all @royaldutchshell employees live on this planet as well. They will be doing what they do because they have a false hope it will be alright in the future. We need to have a just transition for oil & gas workers as we cut our emissions hard & fast.

Moderate protein(25-30%)- Meat, egg white are best options and rest from healthy fats(butter, ghee, safflower oil). The key is to deplete the body carbohydrate stores and..

8300 2018-11-20 14:04:53 ...yeah, it's too damn early to be this depressed about regional politics and the oil money that runs a huge chunk of it.
8301 2018-11-20 14:04:42 1. instead of purchasing a primer just use a moisturizer or oil (like tea tree not coconut) 
2. don’t use powder unless u have naturally oily skin and use it sparingly
3. there’s many different angles for winged eyeliner just start thin and widen as u go into ur eye
8302 2018-11-20 14:04:40 The gods can tell you but you have to grease their hands with oil money

8304 2018-11-20 14:04:30 Using a different oil/ingredient grown in a sustainable, non-intrusive area has to be the best solution of all as despite best efforts to protect, as long as there is such a big market for palm oil, the problem will persist. Only the big brands can drive that change imo.
8305 2018-11-20 14:04:19 The oil industry has been ripping off Canadians for years. Its time for a little payback with lower gas prices thank you very much...

8317 2018-11-20 14:03:14 But, hey, we're sanctioning Iran for not violating their nuclear arms deal (well, except for letting them sell oil to most of the world), so do we get a participation ribbon?
8318 2018-11-20 14:03:02 Try experimenting with regular shadows and pressed pigments to see which is better. It might just be that the oils in your skin don’t react well with the shadows. Have you tried setting your primers as well? Because if it’s an oil problem, then that may fix it.
8319 2018-11-20 14:02:59 Good morning! Here's the latest on the crisis in Canada's oil patch -- that big "differential," or discount paid for Canadian oil vs. global prices.

8328 2018-11-20 14:02:16 Well Doc, I can't argue that, but I highly doubt they are losing sleep about their mineral oil decision.  And if you look into the history of their view on mineral oil you will find they've been here done that too.
8329 2018-11-20 14:02:14 Total (EU) seems to pay a normal level of taxes (30%). I doubt they are subsidised.
You may argue that big oil earns too much, but that is not relevant to the discussion whether EV's are at a commercial tax/subsidy disadvantage vs ICE or not: they are not, quite the opposite.

8338 2018-11-20 14:01:18 Oil price is just a reason, it's all about the last government laws and how quality of life decreases in France for middle class people.
8339 2018-11-20 14:01:05 The term 'ethical oil' is nothing more than a marketing line. Get bent. Cons are cons.
8340 2018-11-20 14:00:57 The first and biggest mistake is allowing the oil companies to decide when to shut down and for how long. A clear case for the need of stricter regulations.
8341 2018-11-20 14:00:56 Yep, that wolf in sheep’s clothing has found oil religion... . But we all know for a fact, it’s all talk no substance.  anything to try for a second term... my response, ah.. HELL NO...
8342 2018-11-20 14:00:39 Phobia doesn't mean fear. It means strong aversion to. Ie "oil is hydrophobic".

And prejudices tend to affect how we behave and treat people. If you could keep anti trans prejudice to yourself and just as your own thoughts? Nobody would care.

8400 2018-11-20 13:54:03 Let's not forget the deal with the Saudis whose terms are classified so Canadians can't know- buying their oil, selling them arms for genocide. #CrookedHarper loved the Saudis so much that CPC overlooks their criminal leaders. Self-serving just like #criminalTrump.
8401 2018-11-20 13:54:02 おつありっぽい？
8402 2018-11-20 13:53:55 IMHO, Richard Nixon knew he was declaring war on a plant that could compete with oil. Plastic made of hemp is 100% biodegradable. Plastic made of oil lasts forever. We should have invested in hemp instead of oil. Our oceans and landfills would not be as polluted with plastic.
8403 2018-11-20 13:53:29 And tRUmp has given oil companies a pass to further damage the coast.
8404 2018-11-20 13:53:17 using tea tree oil WITH A CARRIER LIKE VITAMIN E OIL SO IT DOESNT BURN YOUR SKIN is good for acne! jojoba oil does great for scarring. vitamin e oil is my standard moisturizer. those three are my faves
8405 2018-11-20 13:53:12 普通に日本語つかおうぜ。
8406 2018-11-20 13:53:11 The structure we operate concentrates all focus on the fed govt to drive development. My opinion is that the various states should be very active partners in the journey for development rather than being passive recipients of oil money. You'll not value what you didn't work for.
8407 2018-11-20 13:53:10 I got pepper oil in my eye  I’m drying, send some help 
8408 2018-11-20 13:53:09 I filled petrol today in Haryana on outskirts of Delhi at Indian Oil at rate of Rs 74.89 per litre. It's down by at least Rs5 - Rs7 per litre on average
8409 2018-11-20 13:53:02 I get four when I need them, but rotate with every oil change anyway
8410 2018-11-20 13:52:56 The money and oil are running out so the wealthy and elite are panicking. We are seeing the resulting chao in governments turning on themselves and the media showcasing this globally. The internet (another form of media) is accelerating this, like it accelerates everything.
8411 2018-11-20 13:52:54 Scammers. Grifters. Snake oil salesmen. You can spot the jig many miles away if you’re patient.
8412 2018-11-20 13:52:41 For all the concerns about giant ships carrying fuel off either coast of Canada & environmental footprint,

how many Cruise ships make the trek back & forth along BC coast or St. Lawrence chock full of fuel all summer long?

So what’s the difference between big boats full of oil?
8413 2018-11-20 13:52:22 Made breakfast using red wine since i ran out of cooking oil 
8414 2018-11-20 13:52:18 Where can I buy the chocolate spread that tastes like Nutella but doesn’t have palm oil in it and is suitable to vegetarians?? I think it’s called vege something?
8415 2018-11-20 13:52:14 Wood burner? My dad/brothers built a little wood burner for the garage. They lived out there no matter how cold it was! That thing warmed the garage so well! I want to say it was an old oil barrel.
8416 2018-11-20 13:52:09 So you've gone from it's healthy to it's better than not having any other cooking oil. Which is it?
8417 2018-11-20 13:52:07 I use CBD oil everyday and I can attest to what you are saying.  It helps me with my pain and anxiety.  I do not get 'high' from using CBD oil.  I love it and my life would definately be more difficult without it.
8418 2018-11-20 13:51:57 @Citi @AskCiti @IndianOilcl Anyone listening to my query ?

8422 2018-11-20 13:51:39 finding one or two good oils that work for you is enough you don’t need all of them. basic inexpensive ones are the best like jojoba oil, vitamin e oil, rosehip oil. please don’t buy $70 fancy oils from sephora it’s not necessary

8428 2018-11-20 13:51:14 No kidding! Two generations of kids who never mowed their own lawns or changed the oil in the car! The Oligarchy outsourced skilled manf jobs to China, and converted America into a consumption economy. This is one result: kids who don't know anything but consumption!
8429 2018-11-20 13:51:06 Aaron’s route to “fully automated luxury communism.”

Discover oil. Pretend the age of oil isn’t coming to an end. Reduce population to 9 million. Get 88% of work done by immigrants with fewer rights. Change name to United Kingdom Emirates.

Easy!

8448 2018-11-20 13:49:16 Thank you @Uwihanganye_A for sharing. However I wonder  the consideration made to the graduates of Petroleum geoscience and production from Makerere. The shortage needs to be justified given that we have many graduates of oil and gas industry that are unemployed.

8452 2018-11-20 13:48:36 i got an oil change yesterday for $19.14. it’s kind of hilarious what i get excited over these days.

8461 2018-11-20 13:47:55 Fertilizer prices do have a very strong coorelation to Oil prices.  But any product that takes lots of energy has a strong link to oil.  But oil crashed THEN fertilizer crashed after.  Urea: $1000 to $400 Retials and Farmers that owned those positions got crushed in fall of 2008.
8462 2018-11-20 13:47:47 Now for the wait at the dealership for this oil change...glad i have my coffee....
8463 2018-11-20 13:47:47 Yep. And oil was under $100 during pretty much half his majority. Nice try to deflect the fact you made a statement that is easily proven wrong.
8464 2018-11-20 13:47:34 @thomasinamiers Was intrigued by your lovely recipe in @guardian at weekend. Venison pad kra prow - big fan of venison mince & always interested in trying something new. But can you tell me is reference to 300ml of rapeseed oil correct? It seems a lot.
8465 2018-11-20 13:47:33 Don't forget about the man sentenced yesterday for killing his wife & two daughters so he could be with his sidepiece. He SMOTHERED his own babies and dumped their bodies in an oil container
8466 2018-11-20 13:47:26 おーし、お仕事しちゃうぞー
8467 2018-11-20 13:47:26 @AbrahmL @NYTmag We must take into account the right of millions of farmers to cultivate the land as well as preserve flora and fauna. 

#PalmOil is the most sustainable cultivation that guarantees this balance. Iinstead of boycotting it, we have to support palm oil.
8468 2018-11-20 13:47:10 And almost 20years after the then V.P seeking to be president said the oil producing states can now have 100% control over their resources. I guess he's going to Gazette this even before the result would be announced. Abi!
8469 2018-11-20 13:47:06 I wish all real Texans like me would see Trump for the snake oil salesman he is and Run him out.

8471 2018-11-20 13:46:34 @matteosalvinimi definitely will stand firm. He openly accused those big US food corp for destroying italian cultures and agriculture. Yes italian olive oil and no to McD hamburgers!! If it sells out to the US, it will be those M5S folks. They have no BONES.
8472 2018-11-20 13:46:27 Well all trade with England would cease, Scots would lose any pension entitlement, oil wells would shut down production and Trident would be moved immediately to somewhere like Portsmouth.
All the usual stuff we were warned about in 2014
8473 2018-11-20 13:46:19 Consistency is almost mealy and it just doesn't tastes good.  Maybe I'm cooking too hot.  I switched to macadamia oil and got much better/tastier results.

8477 2018-11-20 13:46:07 That means you have to resort to regular oiling, but you'll have to be washing your caps and hijab regularly because of how it'll soak up the oil in your hair
Except you'll do it on days you're not going anywhere
I had a mixture of black seeds oil and Shea butter made once
Try it
8478 2018-11-20 13:46:05 That's more reason we don't need senators who can't pass a bill for creation of more IT firms, while we need a president who believes we can earn more by if we look away from oil. Agriculture, rail and also IT..
8479 2018-11-20 13:45:59 Beautiful trouble
8480 2018-11-20 13:45:56 I can tell you why oil he was being protected by bush  on a documentary a sniper had bin laden dead to rights with a clear head shot he was told no under bush presidential order thats why
8481 2018-11-20 13:45:53 Olive oil
8482 2018-11-20 13:45:51 So make sure you have ample savings and check the costs of furniture etc that you will need. Also don't underestimate the cost of cooking basics, like herbs and olive oil (not to mention cutlery, pans, plates, etc). And definitely figure out what you're going to do with laundry!

8496 2018-11-20 13:44:58 Palm oil is very high yield. Replace it with another oil, you need more land for the crop. They source their palm oil from legit sources, and should be commended for that. Boycotting them would be punishing them for doing the right thing.

8501 2018-11-20 13:44:23 Traffic lights are a force for evil.   Obesity is a form of malnutrition caused by this rubbish.   They want you to eat as much food as possible with as little nutrition  as possible.     They want everyone to eat starch, oil and sweeteners.
8502 2018-11-20 13:44:18 Worked on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in Mississippi great state great people don’t let the two to racist bigots in the picture ruined that track record Mississippi has moved into the 21st-century we hope?
8503 2018-11-20 13:44:15 He would do it even if there was no oil, someone would have to make a baseless claim and the money would flow, Alberta has the real thing and nothing, Alberta maybe has a right to separate under this condition.
8504 2018-11-20 13:44:06 At this point in term I’m around 20% Olbas Oil, 30% Nurofen, and 50% Earl Grey Tea.
8505 2018-11-20 13:44:02 Sadly Nick Grealy has passed away and with him any idea there will be shale gas fracking in London. That said almost certainly some conventional oil to be found inside the M25 in South London....

8513 2018-11-20 13:43:18 Yeah, ok.  The only difference between his lies and Obama’s is that Obama’s were well scripted. A true snake oil salesman.
8514 2018-11-20 13:43:11 That's 1200 years of global oil consumption at $56 a barrel assuming 90MM barrels a year.
8515 2018-11-20 13:43:07 In the morning:
1-I wash my face with organic black soap( it’s and Egyptian kind I forgot the name, oops)

2-i put cleanser on my face, I rube then wash with cold water ( cetaphil)

3-i put rose water on my face 

4- I put the tree oil ( lush)

5-finally I moisturize
8516 2018-11-20 13:43:06 The oil price has recovered from last week's battering, ostensibly soothed by the possibility that OPEC and its partners could cut production to prevent another global surplus from forming. But the futures market shows investors remain unconvinced that such a plan will work.

8519 2018-11-20 13:42:56 Vance, is TPPF being paid to advocate for predatory lending again this session? Oklahoma oil company paying y’all for anti-wind energy campaign? Whose banking the new large-scale, for-profit charter school push? #txlege
8520 2018-11-20 13:42:44 True, but we don't have much of a choice in the matter. I think it's perfectly fair to be critical of an industry that is afforded luxuries that others aren't. How many others are allowed to self regulate as the oil industry is allowed to in this place?
8521 2018-11-20 13:42:43 The RB/HO imbalance is a confluence of major shifts in oil markets - surging production of light U.S. shale oil, plummeting exports of heavier Venezuelan and Iranian crude, weakening gasoline demand and rising diesel consumption.
8522 2018-11-20 13:42:32 A can of green lentils, drained and tossed in small amount of oil, chopped cornichons and carrot, and then seasoned to taste: eg soya, Henderson’s etc. We go for @Sriracha_FG Sriracha Mayo, a great vegan option. Serve with little gem lettuce.

8525 2018-11-20 13:42:17 Oil in yogurt sounds gross..... Maybe I've misunderstood
8526 2018-11-20 13:42:17 Ethanol subsidies ended in 2011. The mandate is to blend because without it Big Oil wouldn’t blend with ethanol. Ethanol replaced toxic MTBE as an oxygenate and octane booster. They refine 83-85 octane gas. Ethanol is blended to boost octane and oxygenate the fuel.
8527 2018-11-20 13:42:12 Turmeric is definitely an oil with super powers for your health. Lavender is often called the Swiss Army Knife of oils because it can be used in so many ways. Support your body, mind and spirit with these two oils. This BOGO deal is today only!

8534 2018-11-20 13:41:20 Its sad, and it is st discussed enough. I back Iceland and their palm oil advert because it’s brought it to the attention of those who weren’t aware. But the wider issue is meat.
8535 2018-11-20 13:41:19 #JKX nice move. Been a distressed seller in a tiny volume share, annoying but if they’ve finished unloading this’ll ping back to highs quickly. Seems tied to oil price not gas price so a turn in oil too would be welcome!

8543 2018-11-20 13:40:33 Hi Nuala, since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.

Else you can change your diet plan. Stop talking any carbohydrates like rice, bread and minimize use of sugar,  salt and ghee/oil.

But you will still need to put up a plan on paper.

8563 2018-11-20 13:39:19 I concur and a few items due. Seen it bag with constant drag of 50p/1.2p funds deals show its imo the best opp on oil and gas market and really deserves a ten quid plus sp as of today.
8564 2018-11-20 13:39:17 ALL morphes pinks and purples stain ur eyes, even the blue... it’s just the way the pigment is ... if you use a better remover that has an oil base vs just a makeup wipe it should come off easier... also when you use a makeup wipe and scrub your skin it can become irritated so
8565 2018-11-20 13:39:15 That was Iran’s money that had been frozen. It was not taxpayer money. Speaking of Iran, when Trump dumped the deal, Putin waltzed in and is now making billions in oil. Not the US. Now, Saudi is cutting production, that will increase costs to us. This IS not hard.
8566 2018-11-20 13:39:11 How is it that one meeting with Mr Prime minister oil prices starts reducing daily. Was Mr finance minister shown middle finger by the oil companies Or he has no control over his ministry.

8672 2018-11-20 13:28:15 Someone mentioned in YouTube that Kessinger loved attention and called her a @$@&, this person also mentioned that they acted like they were lovers at work site, I guess this person knew them, this person even mentioned that the whole oil staff knew about this affair...
8673 2018-11-20 13:27:55 When I first bought my car they put a full tank of gas in it for me before I pulled off the lot , now that she’s broken there giving me a free oil change along with fixing her for free

The three years of PDP after military rule are better than the three years of APC after PDP.

If you can't do your own Oil Revenue, GDP, and HDI research on this, please just jump and pass. 

Thank you.
8682 2018-11-20 13:26:14 The laura lee party animal palette we got in boxycharm not only stained my lids for three days but i tried oil based makeup remover and it stayed. That pink and purple shades made me look sick and beated up for THREE DAYS...

8684 2018-11-20 13:26:09 Tom, Trump is a subhuman. There is no bottom to his lack of compassion and insincerity. Yet, there no bottom to 40% of American stupidity. He gets an A+ for snake oil.
8685 2018-11-20 13:26:09 Were doing a potluck at work on Wednesday and I asked if anyone had any allergies before I made my brownies with Walnut oil and most people said “idk” and I’m like  because how do you not have an Epi pen permission convo with the people you work with?!?!?!?

8687 2018-11-20 13:25:49 The way we are going, some entrepreneurs will just start carrying gun to snatch money from ppl
8688 2018-11-20 13:25:44 who will push through anything trump requests. As trump has opened Federal forest up to exploitation by lumber companies, big oil, fracking, etc. so would he open up the coastline to big oil, fracking, and development if the govt gets their hands on it.
8689 2018-11-20 13:25:41 Trump is just ah "Snake Oil Salesman" that Slid through the "Electoral College",Mr.Mueller or 2020 will "Fire" him !!!!!
8690 2018-11-20 13:25:37 Those teeth are meant to be pointy and vegetable oil is better for the environment...
8691 2018-11-20 13:25:36 The oil plunge continues... $UCO
8692 2018-11-20 13:25:35 Why on earth would Canadians support TMX so Alberta oil can be sold at big discounts while Eastern Canada would pay you top dollars. Ms. Notley and the PM are misleading Canadians just to cover up 4.5 billions of mismanagement of taxpayers money. What we need is "Upgraders"!!
8693 2018-11-20 13:25:34 u bet :) Not even the oil price at 200 would stop me with this....
8694 2018-11-20 13:25:27 stop killing babies to make baby oil.

8699 2018-11-20 13:25:06 Saudi Arabia, the USA, and Russia now produce more oil than OPEC combined...
Which means that oil price is now controlled by just three men, Mohammed bin Salman, Trump and Putin...
Nigeria needs to think out of the box to get out of the box
8700 2018-11-20 13:24:58 It's supply and demand, basically. Ironically demand for palm oil for human consumption soared after the elimination of trans fats was demanded by consumers, but deforestation for timber is another issue too.
8701 2018-11-20 13:24:55 Saudi Arabia well not bad, there’s oil in abundance
8702 2018-11-20 13:24:55 I heard crude oil was discovered there so massive exploration would commence there very soon
8703 2018-11-20 13:24:53 Time to seriously rethink the size of our palm oil plantations. We did successfully replace rubber with palm oil in the past. Now, we cannot compete with cheaper producing nations like Indonesia, PNG, African nations. An alternative must be explored. @teresakok @MyDSA_official
8704 2018-11-20 13:24:51 #BREAKINGNEWSNOW:(DEVELOPING)Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi says the memorandum of understanding on oil, gas development will cover the West Philippine Sea, said to be rich in fossil fuel resources. #XiJinpingPH | via @piaranada

8716 2018-11-20 13:23:48 The only reason why Toll system on our road is a viable option is becos of the ineptitude of the govt. In a good system, major insfrastructures like this should be provided by the government using revenues from taxation and oil. But no they will still tax, sell crude & toll.

8726 2018-11-20 13:22:08 If at all there is a climate change. Everything that goes wrong we want to attribute to the poor climate when we are the ones greedily cutting down trees and doing fossil oil
8727 2018-11-20 13:22:07 So? Would "we want Saddam's Oil and to look cool for the next election" be a "better" meaning?

8761 2018-11-20 13:18:48 Sure it cost $85,000, those gallons of oil paints cost a hell of a lot of money. Just saying.
8762 2018-11-20 13:18:38 Not once did anyone ask that for Brexit. Scotland will pay for that. Once again the oil will be wasted on imperialistic vanity project. Reclaiming Independent will cost but it is revenue positive from new equal union membership
8763 2018-11-20 13:18:35 No thanks, you have removed vegan choices to add more dead animals over Xmas... Vegans use less palm oil than feeding all those meat animals so you are actually encourageing the use of Palm Oil... Lost my family's shopping.

8775 2018-11-20 13:17:07 Not very for me, SNP have target to be carbon neutral by 2050, this needs to be brought forward now to 2032.  We can’t claim carbon neutral if we’re allowing oil to be extracted and used even if it’s other countries
8776 2018-11-20 13:17:04 Yes the U.K. gave into the SNP lobbies to reduce the tax burden on the oil companies, how weak of them
8777 2018-11-20 13:17:02 Weaning Naija from the  years of oil  addiction ahas its socio-ecnomic consequence. Some we are experiencing today. Only those with fraudulent agenda will not agree this govt is trying it's best in this area. No addict goes into rehab without suffering the pains of withdrawal.
8778 2018-11-20 13:16:57 @Toucherandrich @KenGriffeyRules listen to Fred, get an oil vape pen. You’d be fine with a sativa. Indica will knock you out or couch lock you.
8779 2018-11-20 13:16:56 Additionally, driving incurs societal costs that the individual spreads to everyone: air pollution; CO2 production and climate change; global wars to ensure oil supply; lost time from traffic and congestion. Congestion pricing puts a price tag on these costs.
8780 2018-11-20 13:16:53 So opec cuts off oil again ? So we have 20 dollars a gallon gas and diesel . And force you to buy electric car . So then price of electric doubles . Then price of everything else doubles . While you still make the same wage . What a plan Dems drum up .

8782 2018-11-20 13:16:44 I don’t think your meeting will be beneficial for Canadian at all, we selling the cheapest oil in the world because of access to market so you get to fix inside before looking for magic. Eastern Canada they Buy oil from Gulf while Alberta landlocked for access
8783 2018-11-20 13:16:34 also remind the remind the people that crude oil price was #28 on the day jonathan handed over and the economy was still stable how come everything crumble within the first year of APC regime
8784 2018-11-20 13:16:30 Foreign investment in Iraqi oil is a good thing for the Iraqi people, dude. You're lucky to live in a time where global commerce is protected by the US. 

Japan is a sovereign democracy. If they want us to leave, then they can.
8785 2018-11-20 13:16:23 Selling arms to a murdererous butcher, largest oil spill off Nfld, markets teetering, murder/ violence rates rising, we have mental health crisis, life becoming unaffordable for most, our neighbour is flirting with fascism, and it's poison is spreading. So SMOKING is the prob.
8786 2018-11-20 13:16:22 Why the anchor remained silent while Congress spoke person gave oil to bjp spoke person, why hadn't she opposed it.

8793 2018-11-20 13:15:45 In my experience, liquid concealer does precisely nothing for covering spots, so I always use a stick (it's super cheap, from Natural Collection) and a wee flat brush. I never use my hands to apply my makeup because my face is like a crude oil reserve lol

Huge brexit costs avoided too as iScotland joined EU in some capacity.
EU will welcome oil & Scotland's strategic position.
England's a mess.
8796 2018-11-20 13:14:55 And the fact that most of our oil came from whales and seals.
8797 2018-11-20 13:14:55 Yes, something to help with the dryness. I have Shea butter, vitamin e oil, olive oil & coconut oil.. nothing has really helped
8798 2018-11-20 13:14:22 @realDonaldRump Remember when the pathological lying azz & Russian installed puppet claimed that he’d run into a building with an active shooter? This liar is very afraid of visiting our troops in war zones. Everything about this snake oil is a big fat lie. Impeach him already!
8799 2018-11-20 13:14:15 Education Education Education is the only viable solution to Nigeria economic problems and I can assure you that Buhari or any northerner  can NEVER get Nigeria there..they want free and easy access to oil wells in the South South..We must match on to economic liberation

8803 2018-11-20 13:13:55 This privatization policy is a bane to the economic future of Nigeria. Our economy is mainly sustained by the oil sector. Who are the potential buyers, but looters, diverters of public funds, who call themselves 'powerful' entrepreneurs?
8804 2018-11-20 13:13:30 Saudi Arabia is the biggest sponsor of terrorism and their state oil company Motiva enterprises in port arthur texas is the biggest refinery in the US and is attempting to monopolize the keystone pipeline and the Canadian tarsands. what can you do?

8811 2018-11-20 13:12:49 Trump knows about climate change. He just doesn't care. He's probably getting too many bribes and kick-backs from the gas & oil industry and also from the logging industry, apparently.
8812 2018-11-20 13:12:43 This dude walked to work through a hall filled with oil paintings of Washington and Lincoln, sat at a desk made from a historic ship, then tweeted a shit joke
8813 2018-11-20 13:12:30 We rarely think of hand oil...

Unless dealing with ancient documents, art or craft works...

But let me tell you...

My hands hurt...between the cuts & problems...the lack of natural-hand-oil is a problem.
8814 2018-11-20 13:12:22 @DocThompsonShow @realBradStaggs OEA isn’t the only think in Olive Oyl...oh wait, y’all meant the other olive oil.
8815 2018-11-20 13:12:18 I’d feel a lot less skeptical about CBD oil’s efficacy if every person promoting it didn’t have a referral link in their posts. Anti influencer marketing.
8816 2018-11-20 13:12:15 the reason it only slightly stained your skin when you swatched it and it was harsher when you used it on your eyes is because the skin on your eyes is thinner. I’m allergic to lots of products and have very sensitive skin so I’d recommend an oil based cleanser.
8817 2018-11-20 13:12:04 In the beginning was the Word, and the oil tree ; I will put a new song, and his own received him not.
8818 2018-11-20 13:12:03 The rules to seem to be inconsistently applied.  Would prostitute have been better?
8819 2018-11-20 13:11:52 Got a “trim” yesterday. The lady took 5 and a half inches off you can’t have big hair like me and short hair at the same time. It doesn’t work like that. Say hello to coconut oil and B7

8822 2018-11-20 13:11:05 False. She encouraged working class individuals to run and even primary certain democrats (didn’t mention socialism). She talked about progress. Not taking money from oil company’s for example. It’s not a bad thing to be progressive by not being beholden to special interest.
8823 2018-11-20 13:11:05 We add palm oil when making it.
8824 2018-11-20 13:11:03 This a Dem plot to have a gas and diesel go to 20 dollars a gallon ! To force you into electric cars . No imported oil as it cut off . And our gov will continue to export it to China and Japan
8825 2018-11-20 13:10:41 Sana oil ba?? Hahaha
8826 2018-11-20 13:10:28 Kohlrabi is a vegetable also known as a German Turnip, related to broccoli and cabbage. I found it at stop and shop in the area with the fresh cut veggies.  I saute it for 6 minutes in olive oil and use it just like pasta.

8832 2018-11-20 13:10:01 Peterson is always giving neutral responses if ppl wld just really listen to his snake oil salesman scheme. I’ve been trying to tell ppl he’s a fraud for months+months+monrhs. Big fights w/his cult-like following.  I’m glad ppl like Milo (& Chadwick) are being honest re: JP
8833 2018-11-20 13:09:59 Kan  teruskan yer. Kalau dah jumpa cleansing oil yg sesuai tu, just stick to it.
8834 2018-11-20 13:09:55 And to now come and say he is just developing interest in the oil industry.!! Who says that? JUBRIN until proven otherwise. The real Buhari was former commissioner and minister of Petroleum.
8835 2018-11-20 13:09:53 You guys are mean today. I'm not a hipster, I hate most hipster things but I am extremely passionate about the environment and like to do as little damage as I can, especially after working in the oil industry for some time.

8844 2018-11-20 13:08:42 I know it seems like a waste of time cuz their ideas are just THAT rooted in bigotry but responding to any kind of ideology with physical violence is like pouring gasoline on an oil fire thinking its going to extinguish the fire.

8851 2018-11-20 13:08:10 @JoshGottheimer you need to back this and commit to NOT accepting PAC $$ from oil and gas companies. Time for you to act like a true Democrat
8852 2018-11-20 13:08:08 Have you been asleep for the last 3 years? It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that we’ve been played & picked up the tab for the deliberate shut down of our oil industry by Notley & Trudeau.
How can you be ok with that?

8863 2018-11-20 13:06:00 Unfortunately it's not palm oil that's killing them, as you said it's deforestation which is caused by locals cutting and selling trees illegally, once trees gone they move on leaving bare land that is THEN used for plam oil by others. Orangutans killed by loggers.
8864 2018-11-20 13:05:55 Looking at data, I doubt if our oil reserves could substitute LNG imports. The proclamation of shell gas reserves in Balochistan has also been dusted.

8880 2018-11-20 13:03:34 thank you! I hoped it could. I have my doubts about boycotting all palm oil, in case it harms farmers trying hard to work with the land.  I prefer to pick out the companies supporting the least sustainable methods for profit's sake.

8886 2018-11-20 13:02:33 Yeah, but there are skeptics out there and that's ok. We need them to keep it all honest. FDA approved and now we see from Cardiologsts that they think mineral oil was fine too.

8888 2018-11-20 13:02:12 I use a damp paper towel and some kosher salt, if I need an abrasive. Then dry it and wipe it with oil when it's cleaned out.
Otherwise, just wipe it clean with a dry paper towel.

8890 2018-11-20 13:02:04 Rupee rose against the US Dollar but trimmed gains as banks bought Dollars noting a rise in Dollar index.

8910 2018-11-20 12:59:52 Honestly, I haven't followed close on the palm oil industry other then the demand for the oil is very strong. Is it a sustainable (ugh, that over used word) demand though?
8911 2018-11-20 12:59:49 Coconut oil. Herbal detox teas are great (roasted dandelion root), green tea is good. Lemon water or fresh squeezed lemon in tea. Bitter things help. Seeds and nuts. Ground flax seed, which I have at home. A big old salad 
8912 2018-11-20 12:59:48 I should have known everyone would want their oil changed before the holidays. I fucked up

8925 2018-11-20 12:58:50 I don't tend to shop at @IcelandFoods that often as there isn't one near me, if they don't reply, I can check later, but palm oil goes under so many different names even I struggle to identify it!

Nothing like stirring the pot early

Palm oil is being harvested as a cheap food product or feed additive.

Displacing n killing wildlife draws attention for sure to the situation.

I can't help but wonder what other enviromental damage is happening by ripping up forests.

8943 2018-11-20 12:57:31 However, payment of pensioners abandoned by OBJ, Yaradua and GEJ is what I call great achievement. Completing abandoned projects is also great. Diversifying our economy from oil base is splendid. Building new infrastructure and new refineries coming up is the koko.

8952 2018-11-20 12:56:11 How to prepare for #ThanksgivingWeek - deserts- vegan ice cream, Organics brand box baked cake or cookies or brownies. Just read the ingredients and swap for coconut oil and apple sauce for eggs.
8953 2018-11-20 12:55:59 Wish I could be there to support our oil and gas
8954 2018-11-20 12:55:48 A low weight oil, mixed with detergents and mineral spirits, it's highly flammable and too thin to handle compression. I assume this would not work well. I use it regularly for tool cleaning and quenching mixtures but... As engine oil. That makes me nervous.
8955 2018-11-20 12:55:45 @MutWEEI  Buy the hemp oil instead of marijuana - the hemp oil, without the THC in it, helps with sleeping.  It is legal to buy and Jess should be cool with it, no smoking required and it works great! :)
8956 2018-11-20 12:55:39 Hi, we ensure the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights and does not use forced or child labor. We continue to implement our Palm Oil Action Plan.  We achieved RSPO certification 3 years early.
8957 2018-11-20 12:55:34 I woke up early to get an oil change, who am I

8959 2018-11-20 12:55:24 If the damage occurred during the storm, then oil would’ve been released whether they started up earlier than other platforms or if they started up in 2 months time. A damaged flow line is a damaged flow line.

8964 2018-11-20 12:54:45 David Cameron completely played the claire ridge down pre-referendum, fact. They then had That sell out wank Ian Wood go on our screens to say the oil and gas was as good as finished hence his knighthood and first dibs on all British fracking!

8968 2018-11-20 12:54:21 Ah so it’s not mutually exclusive- USD concurrent necessity-> strengthen in anticipation of higher rates, historical resiliency of long end of the curve+strong dollar and oil falling, ROC of CPI falling-> long long end of the curve. Did I get it right

8972 2018-11-20 12:53:49 What's the annualized growth rate since 1870 (when Standard Oil was founded)? And how do you factor in the monopoly thing? You're not doing your client any favors here.
8973 2018-11-20 12:53:48 Definitely looks dead there.
Angus will have to get a move on with the site or it will be next year before they actually do anything meaningful with the well or get any oil at all.
8974 2018-11-20 12:53:46 OPEC has lost control of the oil market The actions of 3 men - Presidents Trump,Putin & Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman will determine the course of oil prices in 2019.  Together they produce more oil than the 15 members of OPEC. All 3 are pumping crude at record rates.

8977 2018-11-20 12:53:19 Not.  It has been suspected for sometime, but no evidence.  Any amount of LDL, TG lowering is good.  Lower ApoB.  Diet and exercise are key and foundational.  Fish Oil, like any therapy, main challenge is persistence.

8979 2018-11-20 12:53:15 @RachelNotley Who is making money on cheap Alb. oil, Marathon Oil for 1, makes donation $25m to WWF Cand.; Gerald Butts, ex pres of WWF, advisor to PM,; Govt of Can. makes $1.3B over 5 yrs to WWFCan primarily for Southern Orca Whale. See any points to connect; interesting.
8980 2018-11-20 12:52:58 I'm not sure that complaining about big money being in politics then defending big oil(mostly foreign owned thanks to Harper) is way to to win the middle class.
8981 2018-11-20 12:52:42 Congress bashing good. Please also reduce petrol price. Global oil price is 1 year low. It is still under PM control and not under congress.
8982 2018-11-20 12:52:41 Had pasta with dilis and a generous serving of olive oil. Sarap. #FPJAP3Saklolo
8983 2018-11-20 12:52:39 Probably not, that's the oil tanker we need to turn around. Unfortunately you prove virtue by deeds so it usually takes someone disruptive to JFDI - be radically open??
8984 2018-11-20 12:52:34 Yes and Shoprite in the cooking oil oil ironically. Witch hazel try Adam's spice shop and Kamwala (yes there, the indian hair shops)
8985 2018-11-20 12:52:30 One can easily say that Scandinavia has benefited from smart state spending... Norway has about 70%+ tax on oil companies and the benefits are clear, whereas Nigeria on the other hand, well....
8986 2018-11-20 12:52:28 Waiting a couple hours for an oil change. Someone talk to me or I might shrivel away and die.
8987 2018-11-20 12:52:24 He still has yet to mention FDA approval of the use of the mineral oil.

8996 2018-11-20 12:50:40 Here is a budget beauty tip: cooking oils are a cheap and effective makeup remover. 

I have a small bottle of coconut oil in my bathroom that’s expressly for this purpose (I used to use olive oil but prefer coconut’s thicker consistency).
8997 2018-11-20 12:50:18 肌荒れやばいからリポビタンFine飲んで馬油洗顔してbio oil塗って寝る！！！
8998 2018-11-20 12:50:10 Try edibles like gummies. Easier to dose. Oil has been hit or miss for me personally.
8999 2018-11-20 12:50:04 Where does Extra Virgin olive oil come from? From really ugly olives, which are sometimes called Pelosi Olives?
9000 2018-11-20 12:49:55 Oil ,oil, oil, oil...OIL. Always follow the money, or in this case the Putin-Exxon-Venezuela oil trail. They are framing the next theater of war to fight for "democracy". 
9001 2018-11-20 12:49:50 Castor oil????
9002 2018-11-20 12:49:50 So if there was oil discovered in the English channel you would gladly send it up here? As soon as North Sea oil was discovered Westminster put a claim on it because they knew you would be fucked without it
9003 2018-11-20 12:49:47 One question for PMB: how much did you save us on oil subsidy payments/non-payments and to what project are you assigning it to, in the next level?
9004 2018-11-20 12:49:43 wipe her with a paper towel, briefly run it under extremely hot water, paper towel dry it, and rub some quality olive oil on it.

Soalnya pernah denger kalo baby oil bisa bikin pori tersumbat
9006 2018-11-20 12:49:32 They have never been an ally. They just have money and oil. Big difference.
9007 2018-11-20 12:49:27 Yeah her concern is the kids. I’ve never tried it. Pretty sure she did back in high school. Not sure I want to smoke it but an edible or oil that helps w/ anxiety/relaxation might be pretty nice, tbh.
9008 2018-11-20 12:49:27 Cutting out palm oil is absolutely pointless if you're still consuming animal products
9009 2018-11-20 12:49:26 The FDA DOES THE WORK  - NOT THE ORANGE BUFFOON OR YOU SIR!  By the way you are dripping in big oil donors thanks for the price hikes!

There was no mention of 'only if the CBI likes it', 'soft' or 'hard' Brexit, on the ballot - only IN or OUT

9065 2018-11-20 12:42:34 Maybe instead of criticising Trump for not visiting we should instead be asking what the hell US troops are STILL doing in Afghanistan? The US idolises veterans but loves to send them to other countries to further the aims of oil, gas and weapons manufacturers
9066 2018-11-20 12:42:20 Also worth noting @GOP, Trump threatened to run as an independent candidate if @GOP didn't financially back his campaign. Remember that? How's that for loyalty? You're siding with a snake oil salesman. A bad, bad decision.

9074 2018-11-20 12:41:13 No different than the government sending troops to protect assets like oil. They knew the odds are at least one American soldier would die wherever they're sent for whatever reason the "leadership" gets richer.

9082 2018-11-20 12:40:51 All you have mentioned are truth about South Sudan, we have enough oil reserves, thanks to God but unfortunately we do not have leaders to help us prevent, mitigate and lower the risk of exposer to oil waste and as well as ensuring citizens reap the benefits of our blessings.

9086 2018-11-20 12:40:34 Two days back a tanker named MT Coral Stars berthed at the Kamarajar Port in Ennore near Chennai encountered an accidental oil spill in the early hours of Sunday 18 November 2018.

9097 2018-11-20 12:39:56 No, I think EU27 would be happy to accept us.  They need relative wealth to replace UK, they will assume our Oil will provide that

Oil crashed from 144 to under 50 then returned to 100 in, believe just over a yr. retail crash ? Because of fertilizer ? That’s a new one. Can’t argue that, I’ve never looked into it

9109 2018-11-20 12:39:10 kalau oil gara2 opec sama saudi maenin harga pasar, kalo gasalah salah satu sebabnya gara2 shale oil boom di US beberapa tahun lalu, tapi utk shale oil bisa profit , harga minyak harus diatas 70, karena production cost sekitar 40usd

9112 2018-11-20 12:38:51 Today if we take all demand & supply , as well as inventory crude price trade around $50-55 a barrel. Problem is we allowed to trade in crude oil . Speculator  build up short/ long position in crude so actual fundamental value  is very difficult to determine.

9116 2018-11-20 12:38:15 LoL, it's the burning of oil, not the use in plastics and as a lubricant that causes massive amounts of co2 in the air to trap heat.  What a moron.

9125 2018-11-20 12:36:41 Q - Why Nigeria has bad roads after almost a decade of prolific receipts from oil boom when oil prices were at $100 per barrel.

A - It's because the PDP gov't didn't invest our money in Roads just like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Brazil oil-exporting countries, have done.

9134 2018-11-20 12:35:41 The car wont last longer because of more frequent service. Even if u service after 2000KM. what matters is oil used which can easily go to 10000km without loosing properties. The only thing I check regularly is the condition of the air cleaner.

9163 2018-11-20 12:31:32 Except oil....right!
9164 2018-11-20 12:31:31 Yes! Fry in a little oil, but don't cook for too long 30 secs - 1 minute. Otherwise it goes super hard, you want a slight crisp but a little soft
9165 2018-11-20 12:31:19 Yes, but where does the palm oil in your biscuits come from? Unless you made them yourself, they’re almost certain to contain palm oil.

9181 2018-11-20 12:29:25 As there are planets and moons in our solar system that have a lot of methane, it makes sense that Earth can generate it's own too, but methane is not oil.
9182 2018-11-20 12:29:23 The idea that the average consumer could sustain 6$ Natty was ludicrous. People would freeze, not wanting to put on the heat Same folks thought oil was going to 100$Now, it is my understanding that it would be preferable to have a slow unwind to push up DGAZ price???

1. Wash bi-weekly
2. Cowash bi-weekly
3. Use Oil in my head before both forms of washing 
4. Deep condition weekly

9199 2018-11-20 12:27:25 PLUS DE GAS OIL PLUS DE fUEL PLUS DE CHAUDIERE FUEL ETC....donc plus de livreur de fuel,  plus d'usine de chaudière ou de pièces diverses, Simplement des camions ou des raffineries pour les plus gros pollueurs (avions, bateaux de croisières et Tankers ou cargo  = plus de chômeurs

9201 2018-11-20 12:27:20 People don't understand the power of a military. The country was disarmed and the regime supporters were armed. The Cubans are paid in oil to ensure military loyalty. People are too busy trying to survive now to take on that regime, they just leave.
9202 2018-11-20 12:27:07 Nak tnya, if kita pkai sunscreen utk daily tp x pakai make up x pkai FD, bedak apa smua tu still kena cuci dgn cleansing oil jgk ke ? Ke guna miccelar water & cleanser biasa je dh ckup ? #tanyatk @twt_kecantikann
9203 2018-11-20 12:26:42 Therefore a lot of palm oil producing countries will see the anti palm oil campaign as a subtly racist one because it affects rural non white communities in mainly developing countries and their economy.

I didnt bother to go beyond item 1 cos I know that during the first 8 years of PDP,crude oil price was much lower than now. At some point it was about $17 per barrel.
I supported PMB for 2015 but it is now obvious he has no clue about economy.

9214 2018-11-20 12:25:07 Many anti palm oil companies do admit that not all palm oil is bad, but they’re too lazy to get out there to source for substainable palm oil hence deciding to affect communities that don’t even have a fraction of their privileged status (ie Western economies vs non)

9228 2018-11-20 12:22:22 Buy your palm oil from Africa, where it can be produced responsibly. Your argument is testament to "low cancer cigarettes" nonsense. You use it because it's cheap to drive profits. No need for it at all. Consumers are prepared to pay premium for TOP quality. #saynotopalmoil
9229 2018-11-20 12:22:15 Doesn’t feel like the kind of relationship I’d want to settle into. We don’t even need their oil at this point. Yeah, SA hates Iran & they have strategically useful air bases & buy our weapons, but the cost of alliance is just too damn high, both politically and morally.

9239 2018-11-20 12:21:41 One last consideration; anyone who thinks "Big Oil" could collaborate on keeping this secret has absolutely no concept of how competitive the industry is, or of how many people around the world (hundreds of thousands) would have to be paid off to keep the secret.

9242 2018-11-20 12:21:32 The anti palm oil campaign is an ill researched one with little concern of the larger negative impact if it does cancel the industry: if we developed countries can run mass campaigns about forests we surely have the facilities to campaign and research substainable palm oil.

9258 2018-11-20 12:19:08 Banning palm oil upfront also displaces the economies of small urban farmers who are too busy looking after their sole income to burn down forests. A large portion of deforestation is due to urbanisation.

9262 2018-11-20 12:18:48 I think we have 19 refineries left, down from 40 or something. Again 's. So we do refine oil just not as much as we pull out of the ground and consume. That includes some of the refineries east of Ontario.  has no distribution network.

9275 2018-11-20 12:17:22 Agree 100%, though I do love a burger. Banning palm oil won’t help orangutans or native inhabitants as more forests will be cleared for alternatives that require more space.

9278 2018-11-20 12:16:50 Rumours of this have floated around since I was a petroleum geophysicist in the late 1970's.
Problems:
- No explanation of how such oil could penetrate from the magma into impermeable rocks such as shale and dolomites.
- No evidence of the required "channels" have been found.
9279 2018-11-20 12:16:47 A state machine suffers when the mechanisms in place to keep its people going have the oil removed from them (austerity), a spanner is thrown into the works (Brexit), and the machanics can't decide how to best take it out because they all want to be cheif mechanic (the torys).

PALM OIL FACTS: demanding companies go palm oil free=they're likely to replace it with another oil that causes more destruction.
9343 2018-11-20 12:09:01 What about our consumption ? We need to have a strategic commerical plans with Oil producing countries.
9344 2018-11-20 12:09:01 Admittedly I don't understand global oil markets but if there is a surplus in oil atm and its causing a price crash. Wouldn't the solution be to produce less oil not build more pipelines to produce more?? #albertaoil
9345 2018-11-20 12:09:00 #AAOG Due diligence done, oil is there, drilling re-start end of this week. Topped up more on the low this morning. R1/R2 encounter early next week will send SP over 10p. DYOR, because if you have, you'll agree valuation is way too low. BOD's done what they needed, about oil now!

9348 2018-11-20 12:08:50 He said he doesn’t go to forward areas because we shouldn’t be in those countries in the first place. 

In “Fear,” he’s quoted as saying it’s stupid for us to be in countries if we’re not profiting from their resources. Iraq’s oil and Afghanistan’s ore and minerals, for example.

9353 2018-11-20 12:08:05 In 2014/2015 with the last oil crash, BoC cut rates TWICE when Canadian oil was trading around a low of $32. Are we really to expect Poloz to continue aggressively raising rates when Canadian oil is now around $14 a barrel? That would be insane!!!!
9354 2018-11-20 12:07:53 Look out Saudi Arabia, Canada will buy more oil from you if your not careful
9355 2018-11-20 12:07:50 Ini cleanser, bukan cleansing oil 
9356 2018-11-20 12:07:43 But @MBuhari said he has developed interest in oil. So of he continues to lead this country, then we can't catch up in IT. Let's perish this Refinery and Ajokwuta steel company  funding and make the paradigm shift to build our own Silicon Valley.

9357 2018-11-20 12:07:42 The entire supply chain is segregated from the rest of the industry and as such even the refineries are 'green' and don't process any other palm oil type. We value the opinions of our customers, especially when it comes to decisions like this, so thanks for getting in touch (3/3)
9358 2018-11-20 12:07:37 I guess that palm oil ad was for nothing then - over 90% of soy crop is fed to livestock, with animal agriculture being the leading cause of deforestation. But you don’t care because you want to make money at Christmas? Couldn’t be me - bye babes

9360 2018-11-20 12:07:33 For example, our puff pastry has palm oil to produce the best lamination when cooked. This oil is Certified Sustainable Palm Oil, which is the highest grade of responsibly sourced palm oil available and it's endorsed by WWF as one of the founder stakeholders in the scheme. (2/3)
9361 2018-11-20 12:07:21 Thanks for getting in touch! I completely appreciate your concerns over our use of palm oil in our pastry, and we're fully aware of the issues surrounding its use. The palm oil in our dishes is not something we add ourselves but a small component of some of our ingredients. (1/3)
9362 2018-11-20 12:07:10 (2/2) CBD oil should not have THC-like psychoactive effects. If it does, something is amiss. It's an unregugulated wild, wild west over here, so if it's legal where you live, be careful. If you find a good vendor, be aware that products can, and often do, change over time.

9379 2018-11-20 12:03:46 Yeah oil long is the trade to be in.
9380 2018-11-20 12:03:45 @julianborger great article, however you missed ut one very important piece of information. The US dependency on the world using the dollar to buy and sell oil!.  If saudis decide sell oil in euros the us banking would be in trouble.
9381 2018-11-20 12:03:33 I thought oil was part of the trade. I'm not one for political debate and stuff but just curious.

9384 2018-11-20 12:02:37 Our economy is landlocked politically. We have two oceans but our oil can reach neither by pipeline. The strategy of our foreign policy hurts our national interest. Who influences our foreign policy?

9389 2018-11-20 12:02:10 Apparently everyone’s now on the palm oil band wagon.. So it’s okay to slaughter an animal, but it’s not okay to destroy another animal’s habitat? How are we not treating these issues with the same amount of care and respect?!
9390 2018-11-20 12:01:55 Y aun así leí que la demanda de Oil no cayó. La gente tiene 2 coches, el eléctrico para trayectos cortos y el de gasolina para largos. Además de que se sigue gastando queroseno en aviones, fuel oil en las plataformas petroleras....

9448 2018-11-20 11:55:33 Palm oil is destructive poison. Biofuel bullshit, everywhere it's grown, used or consumed,  it kills.

9459 2018-11-20 11:53:50 No, it quickly unravelled. Was a huge publicity stunt. My understanding was that they couldn’t afford the airtime for the advert, anyway. Also, only involved their own brand, plenty of palm oil elsewhere in the store.....
9460 2018-11-20 11:53:49 Retinol works really well. I have hyperpigmentation from adult acne and I use a cream wash with hyaluronic acid and use a retinol cream on my spots. Tea tree oil is good too.

9478 2018-11-20 11:51:52 This is false. It’s part of the propaganda to discredit @MBuhari . The president being a former Minister of petroleum who understands how the industry works CANNOT make this statement. It’s not possible. The oil sector is governed by contracts that follow a due process.

9489 2018-11-20 11:50:11 If there were no oil blocks how many $millionaires  would Nigeria have today ? and why are the businesses that made the likes of Odutola, Ibru, Ekene Dili Chukwu, FAN rich no longer attractive ? Because Politicians are so busy enriching themselves and lack of infrastructure.

9505 2018-11-20 11:47:26 Good morning Global. Why is it when an oil company admits wrongs (oil spills) the whole country is all over it?  And when major cities dump sewage into the eco system they get a pass?  I’m confused.

9515 2018-11-20 11:46:19 Yeah but that doesn’t negate what’s written there though. It says they can’t be renewed from 2019, not that they’re completely stopping the oil blocks. So they’re still valid for as long as they have left, but no more renewals after this year
9516 2018-11-20 11:46:18 On the other hand, they're anti-palm oil, which has to be a good thing, if you're an orangutan or any of the other species affected by deforestation.

9566 2018-11-20 11:39:47 One thing I know: this company is very much responsible for exploitation of people and the environment from Ecuador to Africa. This is a worldwide rogue actor that doesn’t want the quick development of wind, electrical power, etc.They want the world to use oil as long as possible
9567 2018-11-20 11:39:29 To be fair, the American relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been about money/oil/etc. Trump is more obvious about it, but let’s not act like former Presidents haven’t treated Saudi Arabia differently due to financial/geopolitical motives.

9591 2018-11-20 11:35:40 true! we need to keep our politicians feet to the fire so that they in turn keep the oil industry in check. Unfortunately, it will require some time for a proper investigation into the event. As with all such events, there was a fair bit of confusion as to what occured initially

9604 2018-11-20 11:33:23 Bad move Iceland, I had just started shopping in Iceland because of your vegan range, and ethical stance on palm oil turns out it was a@cynical ploy and I won’t be back. Other stores like Morrisons Tesco & Sainsburys whose vegan range is expanding will get my custom.

If you'd like to DM us, we'll be able to give you more info. - Imogen, CT Team

Vegan food involves cruelty too but each to their own. There's 2 sides. E.g I watch an unbiased palm oil video, there's a lot more to the issue.

9680 2018-11-20 11:21:35 Venezuela is an oil producer that is interested in selling oil in euro or Yuan. That means sanctions. Same with Iran, Russia, and potentially Saudi now too.
9681 2018-11-20 11:21:00 A minute ago news said Canada is loosing money b/c Alberta oil can’t be shipped out efficiently. Then the next news article says how a major oil spill off coast of Newfoundland is basically uncontainable due to weather, Husky oil failure. Why do we do more oil?
9682 2018-11-20 11:20:56 It's not good is it.  It's all about profit really. Having said that, look at the publicity and the knock on effect. Those outraged by palm oil need to think about their meat intake now....it all kills the rainforests.

9724 2018-11-20 11:14:23 I prefer the term "refined" rather than "processed".  Refining includes industrial mechanical and chemical processing techniques which cannot generally be performed in a traditional farm or home kitchen.

9729 2018-11-20 11:13:48 Sorry fella. I don't know much about them as they don't fit within my investment criteria. I like co's around £10m mcap and already have exposure to oil & gas co's.

9788 2018-11-20 11:03:01 The same logic applies here too:

What will it give in return? Weapons and a monarch.
When is this going to end?

9792 2018-11-20 11:02:48 Also I find it wiered that some motorists tend to top up oil at the petrol station. The way i see it on topping up 5-7L of synthetic oil, it shld take you to the next service. Unless you have oil leakage. I have a TIIDA that does 7k with one refill.

9804 2018-11-20 11:01:14 Exactly, that's why the palm oil issue worked for them. Vegans were happy that a bigger chain seemed to be progressing and omnis could get behind it without having to address the bigger issue of anag causing more damage. Iceland wins.

9870 2018-11-20 10:50:24 Yep. We are against killing and spending trillions on the war machine. We’d rather clean the oceans, rejuvenate the forests, feed people, ensure healthcare and keep oil out of our drinking water. Yes, we are terrible people.

9902 2018-11-20 10:47:33 Why is UK hanging on to us if we run a deficit?  Could it be oil?  All Scotland has to do is tax oil properly, and sit back.  Norway, here we come.

9904 2018-11-20 10:46:52 It has everything to do with PO. If your intention is to stop deforestation, then you can't just look at PO. Soy and livestock causes more deforestation than PO.

Biggest problem for most of the people complaining are human rights. And that's the problem.

9940 2018-11-20 10:40:39 Electro Daddy says all kinds of things. But putting an electric revolution in the seat of oil isn't the worst idea. Formula E can't sit on its laurels if it wants to stay challenging.

9952 2018-11-20 10:39:10 Reason for increasing placebo-arm levels in general, as is also seen in other studies not using mineral oil likely in big part due to a reversion to mean effect as patients were "stabilized" before start of study.  Which would affect both arms.
