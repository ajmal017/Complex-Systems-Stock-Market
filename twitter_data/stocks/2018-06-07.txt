But it is deniable. 
The economy has been charging upwards for yrs. For your statement to be true, one has to believe it would have stopped its forward momentum if Trump hadn't taken over.
BTW, stocks are stagnated.

37 2018-06-07 23:46:48 Now were getting somewhere. That may be true about POTUS. Not sure of that timeline. But what I heard was that both asked the ATF to re-evaluate. POTUS May have said they should be banned. But he says allot that I don’t hear. My point is that off we ask the ATF to ban bump stocks
38 2018-06-07 23:46:34 Invest in toilet paper stocks ASAP as there is a bunch of people in Washington that are shitting themselves. Stocks are sure to continue to rise until the SC investigation is complete. 
39 2018-06-07 23:46:21 Ban the Damn Bump Stocks!  Please.

46 2018-06-07 23:40:25 It’s a no brainer. The US must ban bump stocks
47 2018-06-07 23:40:03 You might want to go over the ‘tax cut’ some more. Unless you are a corporation you will not be getting much. Unemployment has been dropping for 9 straight years. The economy will not be soaring after the tariffs!! Companies are buying back their own stocks. No trickling down.

50 2018-06-07 23:39:17 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
51 2018-06-07 23:34:48 $BIOAQ, .0064/.0075. Bankruptcy stocks always carry a higher risk to them since they can wipe out common shareholders shares. U must be aware of that risk as possible. Lets look at what we have here & see if this may be one of those rare chances when common shareholder do well..
52 2018-06-07 23:34:37 If you are in a position to personally and directly profit by votes that affect your stocks, yes. It's a conflict of interest. That's why Klobuchar and Painter do not directly own stock. Tina Smith is in Tom Price's boat on this.
53 2018-06-07 23:34:31 I def. agree most otc stocks are hysterical. I'm a supporter of $FUSZ , the company has proven itself time and time again. Their product is on Netsuites / Oracles website. I think what happened with the downfall is obviously unfortunate, but in time, I think it will comeback.

58 2018-06-07 23:31:31 Bump stocks are dead........thanks to BINARY TRIGGERS........which is why the ban was even on the table.  Binary triggers for sale EVERYWHERE fire when pulled, and released.
59 2018-06-07 23:30:38 I’m going to start day trading stocks as a summer job
60 2018-06-07 23:30:26 Yes it is a nice list! There are plenty of tech stocks in there, and that will cause some short-term pain as the rotation out of tech continues... Longer term; tech is where the growth is...
61 2018-06-07 23:29:39 I also thought wtf XD but hey you can claim at least 20 of those shitcoins for free and immediately dump it on stocks. That’s the way to go

67 2018-06-07 23:21:38 I’m watching him play & AS HE IS PLAYING WITH MY FUCKING CONTROLLER, he picks his nose between stocks & scratched his BAIR ASS.

71 2018-06-07 23:17:17 I’m not familiar with them and would have to get back to you.

My main goals are to ban bump stocks and improving background checks. I’ve read that a lot of gun owners agree with me.
72 2018-06-07 23:17:09 Thanks for the clarification Doc. From weed to beer just figured you jumped on the vice stocks.
73 2018-06-07 23:17:00 To me all sub dollar biotech stocks are junk. Doesn’t stop me from swing trading on volume and rsi. Bought it in .40s and sold most today. Timing to short is tricky on these though
74 2018-06-07 23:16:31 Exactly. He even made a comment along the lines that making that three dollars felt a lot better than getting money from stocks because he worked for it.
75 2018-06-07 23:16:22 PLEASE get busy with common sense gun reform, ban bump stocks etc as you said you would. #NeverAgain
76 2018-06-07 23:16:14 Yes we need to ban bump stocks, but it's only the first step we should take

83 2018-06-07 23:10:12 Very simple , you don't like bump stocks ?   Don't buy a bump stock !
84 2018-06-07 23:09:37 Agreed. I don't believe that stocks will be offering such low/no returns, though. History says that betting on a lost decade for the stock market is unwise.
85 2018-06-07 23:09:26 Even the NRA is in favor of regulating bump stocks. My issue is you haven't told us the definition for "military styled weapons". I don't believe that's a term used in any legislation, what exactly do you mean by military styled weapons?

92 2018-06-07 23:04:42 You should buy stocks when you think you’re getting a lot for your money,

113 2018-06-07 22:48:38 @MarkYusko A lot of speculative stocks are going vertical--I don't think we make it to December regardless of what your astrologers are predicting. DaveHContrarian's forecast is probably closer to the mark--peak in July/Aug. He thinks 3,200+, but I'm thinking we kiss low 2,900s.

133 2018-06-07 22:38:46 @jimcramer Fed says raise rates bonds are going to go down? Then booming economy with low unemployment means lower stock prices? Big banks will make more money but follow the stocks lower? Sorry I am confused

139 2018-06-07 22:32:15 Sold the stocks and made money today is a good day
140 2018-06-07 22:32:09 @MadMoneyOnCNBC t finally lost his mind say not to buy stocks that are Down  how about. Twtr vrx

142 2018-06-07 22:31:21 in a way, the lds church opposing weed but owning a billion dollars in big pharma stocks is very baller, very anarchist
143 2018-06-07 22:31:02 I believe @POTUS and our legislators are trying to do something to protect our children. But banning bump stocks won’t accomplish that. As to the issues immigration, that’s a bit off topic here. Just trying to stay focused.
144 2018-06-07 22:30:37 While stocks last!
145 2018-06-07 22:29:38 Ban bump stocks now!
146 2018-06-07 22:28:28 Yes, because banning Bump Stocks will fix nothing and "military style weapons" is meaningless.
147 2018-06-07 22:25:23 23 #stocks hit record highs in "finance", check these:

148 2018-06-07 22:25:13 Additionally, there weren't AR15s either. Or, Bump Stocks. 
You are entitled to your beliefs. Thoughts & Prayers.
149 2018-06-07 22:25:05 Thank you for having a discussion. Not used to it on Twitter. I watched the complete video you linked. Neither @DLoesch or the @NRA said they want to ban bump stocks. The NRA along with @POTUS asked @ATFHQ to re-evaluate them.
150 2018-06-07 22:24:24 2.... people living on our street, some veterans, that need our help & he give tax breaks to the wealthy who are mainly just buying back stocks. He has Scott Pruitt in there having a spending spree on tax payer’s dime, on frivolous things, having aides do his personal...
151 2018-06-07 22:24:24 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
152 2018-06-07 22:24:24 #BanBumpStock Kids should be safe in school, we should all be safe in public places. Bump stocks are not for sport, they are for killing people.
153 2018-06-07 22:23:21 Interesting. Can I ask what percentage international represents of your overall stocks exposure?
154 2018-06-07 22:23:10 Plenty of countries are laughing stocks.

USA

155 2018-06-07 22:22:22 Good luck in Quebec. S RNS like your bromance is over . Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
156 2018-06-07 22:21:54 What happened to muh stocks
157 2018-06-07 22:21:40 Nah, bigs it’s probably stocks, but a:to ratio can usually identify whether a guy is a big or just a bigger wing/forward (such as like Tyler Rawson)
158 2018-06-07 22:20:59 Assault-style rifles are made to kill many fast. You can sugar coat if you like but over 80-90% of Americans agree banning bump stocks & high powered rifles. We all want to keep our loved ones safe. We are for banning assault-style rifles,  we are NOT for abolishing the 2nd A

161 2018-06-07 22:19:43 every day citizens should not be able to purchase bump stocks.
162 2018-06-07 22:19:18 Trump will jawbone trade to keep the 10yr and dollar down. Good for stocks.
163 2018-06-07 22:18:51 3 Key things happened in the last 48 hrs worth noting:  1) $DXY has begun to peak out near-term after its May bounce 2) Commodity based stocks have begun to strengthen in recent days, including many Metals and Ag stocks 3) TY Yield snapback has led to #Financials trying to bounce
164 2018-06-07 22:17:40 It ISN’T  us on Twitter who are moving our stocks. Ask yourself what the people running BILLIONS are likely to do next. Fidelity. T-Rowe. Vanguard. Bridgewater. Tepper.

166 2018-06-07 22:16:51 Graham owed his investment success to a growth stock: GEICO.  He bought it as a value stock but held as it became a growth stock.  Buying quality/growth stocks at a reasonable price does work.  I think growth investors who do well do know how much to pay.
167 2018-06-07 22:16:21 Every other person is a landlord and many of them don’t think like that.  A gambler carries a property with negative cash flow. A true landlord makes sure the cash flow is positive. Gamblers cause crashes. Like with stocks when everyone jumps on the bandwagon it time to sell
168 2018-06-07 22:15:29 All good suggestions, but is it necessary to label well meaning people 'left wing' just because they would like to see bump stocks and military styled weapons under stricter regulations?
169 2018-06-07 22:15:26 Thanks b, love you 
170 2018-06-07 22:14:39 Rich got their tax cuts bought back their stocks just like everybody predicted So the Establishment is Trump...

175 2018-06-07 22:12:25 Alleged gold fund managers should stick to what they know and that is gold stocks.  Brent's AUM is SFA. I know many gold stock execs. No one has visited this guy.
176 2018-06-07 22:11:55 Why should there even be bump stocks? Who do they benefit?
177 2018-06-07 22:11:49 Shall thine stocks decrease, and much lost be taken?

Shall thou weep, and garnish thine teeth in horror and in terror?

Shall thou not be deliver into the hands of terrorist, and whoremongers?
178 2018-06-07 22:11:48 Ban bump stocks.

180 2018-06-07 22:09:16 Used to use TC2000 for years looking for channeling stocks. Haven't found anything quite yet that is better, but the TC2000 UI is what ended up making me quit.
181 2018-06-07 22:09:01 If you need a comment then here goes. Yes, bump stocks must be banned as well as the people-killing weapons they attach to. And throw in hand guns as well. They're designed only to kill people as well. All the best with your efforts and leadership.

183 2018-06-07 22:08:23 Gopro is one of those companies that shouldn't be publicly traded (stocks). Because number wise they are losing but all the awesome places there product has been and all the things it has captured is a win. #ThursdayThoughts

186 2018-06-07 22:04:46 Absolutely ban bump stocks!  Why is anyone in their right mind opposed to this?
187 2018-06-07 22:01:20 “Rich kids watch their parents invest in stocks.
Poor kids watch their parents play the lotto.”
188 2018-06-07 22:00:56 Well yeah, that's a month before the draft in a different sport, at a time when stocks aren't likely to tremendously rise or fall. Also in a sport where players head straight from the draft to a team, and top talent is more projectable. Different story.

198 2018-06-07 21:54:14 Yes, exactly.  As spokeswomen representing the NRA, it would be fair to say that “the NRA said..,”.  But, her comment taken at the time, implied that they supported banning bump stocks, but in indsight, you can see the gray in her comment.  She is a skilled rhetorician.

201 2018-06-07 21:53:15 Fair enough. I guess if you're lucky enough to have the extra money to have stocks you'll...continue to be lucky! Well, if that ain't the American Way... or at least what its been of late. The little guy just gets the shaft...

215 2018-06-07 21:44:06 Note to self: Fridays are not the only stock market mornings that can begin on a shitty note. Whatever stocks the news feel sorry for are the ones that people jump to buy the next day... With the money the used to bump up the previous day's damn stocks. Lmao
216 2018-06-07 21:43:34 David doesn’t need a gun to prove he is strong and brave. When will you people get it through your pea brains that no one wants to eliminate the 2nd. amendment.  Common sense gun laws, background checks , ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Majority are in favor of this.
217 2018-06-07 21:43:09 Relax. I'm don't get upset that easily, lol. What you have to realize is a couple of things: 1) It was a down day and 2) AMD drew a lot of notice PM, so it puts a target on the stock from day traders and shorts. You don't ever want to see one of your stocks trending.
218 2018-06-07 21:43:06 It can't be the worst. To make that comparison, ios 12 woukd have to have something different from the rest. And no, memoji doesn't count. Neither does the redesigned stocks app
219 2018-06-07 21:42:33 I’m doing well in the market.  P/E ratios under Obama were super inflated.  Tax reform continues to bring the ratios more in line.  As far as the tariffs go lets see what happens.  The President hits hard at first then negotiates.  Give him a shot.  Stocks up again today.
220 2018-06-07 21:41:58 Ban Bump Stocks now. It's past time for them to be banned.
221 2018-06-07 21:41:23 Glad to see some young folk agree with me ey
222 2018-06-07 21:41:15 Are you actually that naive? Don’t you wonder why he didn’t put his money in a blind trust like all POTUS before him? You don’t think he is changing laws to make his stocks rise? The salary is trash compared to what he’s making now.

278 2018-06-07 21:14:37 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed mixed with tech giving up early gains and the S&P finding upper resistance.

280 2018-06-07 21:14:03 I was thinking street stocks, tour mods, super lates and maybe jettas as a 4 cylinder series
281 2018-06-07 21:13:29 Interesting. The people who most want to ban bump stocks, AR's & the rest don't have a clue what they are, what they're used for or why law-abiding citizens fight for their rights to have them. The least knowledgeable always appoint themselves lord and master over the rest of us.
282 2018-06-07 21:12:40 Yes, ban bump stocks and order all previously purchased to be turned in.
283 2018-06-07 21:11:00 Stocks down to 1.68. Pathetic

288 2018-06-07 21:07:15 A real nudge to improve saving:
Auto-enroll in a program that automatically prioritizes repayment of existing high interest debt
Or require education of auto-enrollees: pay-off pre-existing high interest debt Before investing in lower return stocks/bonds

303 2018-06-07 21:02:39 Combination of factors: Japanese whisky is struggling massively as aged whisky stocks are low. Scotch was the popular one but the recent trend in small batch whiskies has made other countries/distilleries more popular. Irish producers favour the pot still which is less efficient.

311 2018-06-07 20:59:43 Yeah maybe a little far. Now, time in public stocks, with a handy pile of decaying produce or barn clearings, now that would be good.
312 2018-06-07 20:59:20 Tax policy is likely still the main driver.  There are solid economic reasons to expect certain sorts of portfolio reallocation activity near the ends and beginnings of calendar years.  Particularly in stocks that have recently posted large gains or losses.
313 2018-06-07 20:58:31 I also went on Twitter & told the people that had 401k plans call ur broker listed # on their statement & tell them to stop selling their stocks,cause the brokers were making a bundle on selling ur stocks at 1time brokers had been sued 4 that reason....
314 2018-06-07 20:58:12 The truest red will be 100-M, 100-Y, etc.  A deeper 4 color black would not be 100 on all CMYK.  We generally use C-40, M-30, Y-20, K-95.  Lots of little things like that, that most colorists don't tend to sweat too hard on more premium paper stocks.
315 2018-06-07 20:57:35 Had 3 missed calls/ messages left from @GiveBloodNHS today. Apparently extremely low B- stocks and I’m so sad that due to work commitments I’m unable to donate for a few weeks. Please can every register to donate, you honestly could save a life 
316 2018-06-07 20:55:26 Historically, stocks priced to perfection rarely achieve it.
317 2018-06-07 20:54:08 I got a coo 40 put up in stocks and shit. I need to now pay off debts and watch this credit score do the schmoney dance
318 2018-06-07 20:52:17 I would be cautious investing on this current rise. It's a rise based on nothing other than pure speculation. At 0.5-0.6 it was worth a punt. Not to sound overly negative, I'm invested and want the share price to go up. But I've seen #GGP rise and fall very quickly.
319 2018-06-07 20:51:50 The top five stocks that fell today were $NKTR, $STX, $LRCX, $SJM, and $AMD.
320 2018-06-07 20:50:26 There is no reason or place in this country for Bump Stocks......The End!
321 2018-06-07 20:50:11 The top five stocks that gained today were $APA, $AGN, $MCD, $FTV, and $FTI.
322 2018-06-07 20:49:48 The NZX 50 is up 3.05% so far this week, with one day to go. If it holds onto those gains this will be the best week since July 2016. Stocks leading the index up this week are a2 Milk +8.9%, F&P Healthcare +7.0% and Ryman +5.8%.
323 2018-06-07 20:49:35 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD. $GE, $BAC, $F, and $T.
324 2018-06-07 20:49:34 Just an observation. If your portfolio consisted of only those 5 stocks with 20% positions you could be up 9.2%. If those positions are as you state on your pinned tweet your up about 2.5%.

329 2018-06-07 20:46:32 I regret not selling then also... but the rise is attributed to more than ramping.. I think. Loads of drilling for the 5 million cash we have got. Also remember the drills on Ernest Giles are where Newmont technology found 'stuff' to drill!
330 2018-06-07 20:45:13 We need to protect our children, no one needs bump-stocks.

333 2018-06-07 20:44:21 1st time I've done a Q&A with the @actingclassdoc in a while tonight. Great screening in @CSSDLondon the students gave some great questions on working class talent in the arts. Great to hear about audition waver fees in place at the school aswell. But still more work to be done!
334 2018-06-07 20:43:20 That’s just made my week . Thank you! x
335 2018-06-07 20:40:48 After they purchased 'black hill' drilling very soon. This is right next to where newcrest are excavating! RNSs tell the story... reached over 2.5p last year on anticipation of newmont news... but the steady rise now is encouraging. Definitely undervalued ATM #GGP @asjwebley
336 2018-06-07 20:40:39 100%! @sherriffhammond 
337 2018-06-07 20:40:31 strange how nowhere stocks the big bottles of #CokeZero since the sugar tax came in.

338 2018-06-07 20:39:37 Oh look. Most of this is from State Run Media. Just from my personal experience, this year,worst raise in last 4 years. Over half the country doesn’t own any stocks and the federal government is trying to Force utility companies to keep coal plants open
339 2018-06-07 20:39:11 If Bitcoin is not a success, the chances of any of those being a success is very close to 0.  I'll stick to Mid-Cap Value Stocks and Real Estate for hedging.
340 2018-06-07 20:38:23 No. Miss America is a shit competition that judges women by how sexi they are in a swim suit and "wolf of wall street" made his start by selling crap penny stocks and lying about how good they were
341 2018-06-07 20:37:33 The price is building in anticipation of the drill results. Lots of ramping going on. Any slightly negative RNS will see this drop back down very quickly to around 0.5. Still invested here myself, regret not selling at 2.4p! #GGP

345 2018-06-07 20:34:43 Most new traders are brought up to the idea that day trading momentum low float stocks is the most profitable strategy. Honestly, i found that the learning curve to be alot longer as trading low float stocks requires more from yourself. In terms of discipline and mental sharpness
346 2018-06-07 20:34:42 Another thing to consider is that a spread takes place on the close between SPX cash stocks, SPY and ES which sometimes accounts for that type of movement
347 2018-06-07 20:34:41 It means people will be able to add Tron to their investment portfolio with their normal investing. This is huge. Now people will have it divided, stocks, bonds, funds, and now crypto.
348 2018-06-07 20:34:39 We can ban bump stocks!
349 2018-06-07 20:34:04 That's semi understandable..

Bump stocks reduce accuracy and will burn TF up out of an AR barrel rendering it unusable.

But a device that circumvents a law is worth discussing. Even though they can be made at home easily.
350 2018-06-07 20:33:47 Newmont gold spent 6 month doing this own due dilligence on one of the projects that #GGP have and seemingly walked away... but they did leave all the data collected. RNSs tell the story.. Personally I think Newmont wanted drill results before buying in.. there are being done now

352 2018-06-07 20:33:19 You are so fake

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
353 2018-06-07 20:32:16 Ban bump stocks. No one needs an automatic for hunting or self defense
354 2018-06-07 20:32:05 Here are a few oldies but goodies: Aig, Mer, C, Gm, F, , housing stocks, auto, banks, all excellent from 2006 thru 2009 right
355 2018-06-07 20:30:23 Easy access to murder weapons , weak, loose background screenings , letting people on the no-fly list own guns cutting Obsmas mental health protection re: guns, allowing lg clip and bump stocks kills more people than MS 13 when are you going to do something about that
356 2018-06-07 20:28:52 Tonight I had the opportunity to attend a screening of a documentary at @CSSDLondon which focused on the lack of socio-economic equality within the acting profession. Thank you for ur insightful words and encouragement @deeinsidefilm @Tom_Stocks hope to see you in Liverpool soon!
357 2018-06-07 20:28:23 You are the flake.  You do not know how to run a country, only how to destory.

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks & raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

  The world is laughing.
358 2018-06-07 20:27:27 What are the guns? The guns, that’s the real estate. There’s stocks and bonds, artwork, u know shit that appreciates with value
359 2018-06-07 20:27:05 Not all of them. In fact most police departments support a ban on AR 25s, other semi automatic weapons, armor piercing bullets, large capacity magazines.  And bump stocks. They’re aware those weapons are dangerous in the hands of untrained citizens not to mention criminals.
360 2018-06-07 20:27:00 Several stock waves coming.
When Trump tweets about a new tariff or policy change, stocks dip. That's when you buy. Make some profit on the recovery and sell. Wait for the next tweet. 

Look for stock of private education and private prison companies. Otherwise, Large Cap funds.

366 2018-06-07 20:23:08 LMAO.  You have called for several useless investigations.  The Special Counsel is accomplishing a lot.

Why didn’t Trump ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when he said he would? Is he afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

 The world is laughing.
367 2018-06-07 20:21:43 As far as im concerned youre going *further* along the risk curve playing alts. I dont care to own them any more than i worry about missing 100x returns on penny stocks.
368 2018-06-07 20:21:23 Ban of bump stocks - the sale of which is promoted by NRA, sure would have made a difference.
369 2018-06-07 20:20:43 Ban bump stocks please
370 2018-06-07 20:20:38 Mainly this is being brought up so that no one is lulled to sleep w/ the action of only the liquids, e.g. the FANGs, when it may be the secondary and tertiary issues that show a loss of investor conviction first. Will b watching recent new issues closely #stocks
371 2018-06-07 20:20:35 And because most kinds of life look as though they've been accumulating small mutations for roughly the same amount of time (since they each came from their respective genetically pure stocks).

386 2018-06-07 20:12:33 great question.  I am guessing "never".

Now here are two for you: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

388 2018-06-07 20:12:02 In some ways 3 stocks sort of helps Wario since the game is longer, giving him more chance to use waft.
389 2018-06-07 20:11:53 Ban Bump Stocks Now
390 2018-06-07 20:11:10 They would have been transmitting messages about shares and stocks and whatever mundane messages families sent each other, and suddenly they’d have received this random message saying “hey, we’re sinking and require immediate aid”.

395 2018-06-07 20:07:45 Bump stocks do NOT make the weapon shoot any faster... Look it up
396 2018-06-07 20:07:42 Crosscurrents. Dow up 90pts., the S&P, (2.2); Nasdaq, (54); Russell, (5.8)2.37.stocks, so we get a day of rest. Ten-year, 2.91%; crude oil, $65.97/bbl +$1.23; VIX up to 12.37.
397 2018-06-07 20:07:29 Stocks end mixed as "rotation" continues -- out of tech, into lots of other sectors.

Nasdaq slides 0.7%, but S&P edges down just 0.07%, and Dow gains 95, 0.4% to 25,241.

Rising stocks outnumber losers 16 to 13 on NYSE, while losers outnumber winners 16 to 13 on Nasdaq.

401 2018-06-07 20:05:57 Another characteristic of small firm stocks is that a significant percentage of their outstanding shares are held by operating management. In other words, the objective of outside investors is aligned with corporate insiders. #microcap #smallcap

403 2018-06-07 20:05:46 I have now the habit to check the $VIX (aka fear index). I'm fascinated by this index. I've always had an interest in stocks/markets but with the $VIX, it's love. #volatility #psychology #money

415 2018-06-07 19:59:14 Nope. Most of us would like bump stocks banned, restrictions on guns  and cartridges designed to kill as many as possible as fast as possible. But that would interfere with your priors.
416 2018-06-07 19:59:06 Ya but don't worry, it won't affect  our economy or markets.  Judging from the move $MCD had today, every Dow company should take a chainsaw to their workforce to get their stocks to jump irrationally.

446 2018-06-07 19:49:22 I don't think I was complaining, but I'll answer anyway: The idea that  Trump is continuing a positive economic trend is debatable; gas prices  are up, stocks are down, and the full effect of his tax plan is yet to be seen.

449 2018-06-07 19:47:51 Start moving your stocks and mutual funds to bonds funds and bond index funds. As a result of trickledown economics and tariffs, inflation is starting already. When inflation rises, bonds interest rise, and interest payments increase. Ask you advisor about moving some $ to bonds.

452 2018-06-07 19:47:36 I learned about it when learning about bump stocks. Learned about those so I could be informed and land on a side of that debate. I like to research things when I know nothing about them before forming an opinion. Call me weird.

456 2018-06-07 19:46:23 The bubble in the tech stocks is quite alarming. Have you seen what the FAANG basket has been doing in the last 5 years. It’s gotten absolutely ridiculous.

463 2018-06-07 19:44:05 Sweet. I've been watching others buy and hold weed stocks for years. I think it might be time to dip a toe. Too early, you might not get survivors, too late you miss the best moves. (Been there with solar.) Canopy looks promising but I want the NYSE-listing fever to wear off.

468 2018-06-07 19:42:37 And protected. There's never even been an argument to take guns. Passing protective measures should be easy to grasp. Banning an accessory(bump stocks)that make assault weapons more lethal should be a no brainer, instead y'all revert back to 'they're trying to take our guns' lie.

487 2018-06-07 19:36:17 I'm a someone who started reselling half a year ago, and to be honest I fully agree with all of you. Even though there have not been extraordinary collabs lately, the resell prices are falling quickly. I wouldn't blame the 'SS18 kids' tho. Stocks are significantly rising as well.
488 2018-06-07 19:36:12 You obviously don't get any of this, the banning of bump stocks which serve you no purpose whatsoever isn't infringing on your right to own a gun. You blaming leftists = inability to defend need for bump stocks. NO ONE is trying to take guns away at all here. 2A is a right.

533 2018-06-07 19:20:59 Best e trade strategy. Buy the largest 5 market cap tech stocks. Forget password. Recover it 5 years later.
534 2018-06-07 19:20:01 Sir wait, vakrangee result is still to be announced,
535 2018-06-07 19:19:51 Going to be some extremely difficult times ahead imho. The end of the Everything Bubble means the mother of all crashes imho, but not for a few years yet. As for specific targets on the downside for stocks, it'll be a bloodbath, specific levels aside.
536 2018-06-07 19:19:22 No more bump stocks. Ever.
537 2018-06-07 19:18:44 Ban bump stocks. They are by design only used to kill more w/in seconds. When lettuce causes salmonella it’s pulled from the grocery stores. C’mon let’s quit the BS & pull bump stocks off the market. Thank u David Hogg!

541 2018-06-07 19:15:57 Ban bump stocks
542 2018-06-07 19:15:28 The brush stocks  simply amazing 
543 2018-06-07 19:14:26 I stand behind banning bump stocks and stricter gun laws.
544 2018-06-07 19:13:09 I'm not focused on stock of the day ex $CRON but rather which stocks I expect will likely be there next (while still under the radar) ex $IQ
545 2018-06-07 19:12:20 Chart of the day $RARE  wow!  A+ momentum grade. Best Stocks Now App. No current position.
546 2018-06-07 19:11:57 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
547 2018-06-07 19:11:51 $SPY Careful about getting too caught up in short term moves  on good stocks. It’s too easy to miss out on the more significant move. ex $IQ
548 2018-06-07 19:11:45 4-3E is a great place to monologue for hours by myself about how the ammo stocks are exactly Zero
549 2018-06-07 19:10:44 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
550 2018-06-07 19:10:43 America is booming, Stock Market is booming, the Russell 2000 of smaller stocks  just broke our to new highs. Capitalism is working again. Get back to your non profit or government job! Unemployment is at all time low! Yes I am thinking 
551 2018-06-07 19:09:48 Yeah, ETH has all the ICO funding I don't understand this argument at all.

In stocks it would be like managing company performs a stock split. Issues new shares, abandons old rules. 

ETC kept going with the old rules because they were just fine and others took up maintenance.
552 2018-06-07 19:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
553 2018-06-07 19:09:25 $BABA will probably continue the sell-off and if the stock sinks to $198 you BUY! Keep this bad boy on radar.. #Stocks
554 2018-06-07 19:09:19 You can buy bump stocks.  Effectively full auto.  Free market insurance will rake us over the coals.  No corporate greed?? Are you kidding me?? 1978-2013 CEO income has risen 937%.  Cut government to balance budget.
555 2018-06-07 19:08:58 @KinseyGrant Good call on RSI & Tech stocks yesterday. As you see how the market has reacted throughout the day, do you still feel it's reacting the same as January or has there been some positive sign today that signals this is different (hopefully to the positive) Again gr8 job
556 2018-06-07 19:08:54 aye i got 5 bucks in stocks wow I’m rich
557 2018-06-07 19:07:37 @SirMohmednoman the Egyptians stocks are raising

559 2018-06-07 19:06:16 Maybe not  the writer directly, but I get the feeling this piece is designed to let people know about this stock  because im Sure there are many other stocks more noteable and worth mentioning
560 2018-06-07 19:06:08 YES!
561 2018-06-07 19:05:56 Ban bump stocks
562 2018-06-07 19:05:07 Listening to @Tom_Stocks on @TwoShotPod. He’s ace. And so is his dad!!
563 2018-06-07 19:05:02 It's funny that you choose to brag about jobs, when job growth has dropped under your administration, and the stocks gained more under Obama in 1st 500 days.

You're not even 2nd best.
564 2018-06-07 19:04:57 Oh, cool, the RSU grant from last year finally vested.
Oh, crap, they immediately sold and withheld over 41% of it to cover taxes?
I guess I confused how RSU grants versus ESPP shares are handled.  It makes sense, but I still hate how intentionally confusing stocks are.
565 2018-06-07 19:04:51 Yeah, all of those school shootings with bump stocks were horrible.
566 2018-06-07 19:04:38 There is not a direct correlation between activity and profitability in investing.

571 2018-06-07 19:01:53 Yes...fuck the NRA - the organization is poisonous and funnels Russian money to commit election fraud and to specific, NRA-friendly candidates. Individual NRA members are not part of the discussion banning bump stocks. your deflection is obvious...just stop...
572 2018-06-07 19:01:30 Absolutely. Restricted and IFA is way too broad a brush.

Key is understanding whether there may be a conflict of interest. IFA and restricted in no way makes that clear.
573 2018-06-07 19:01:24 Ban bump stocks now.
574 2018-06-07 19:01:12 $WSTI 0.0015 was bottom! Looks like ready for rebound here!

578 2018-06-07 18:59:45 @DhronasApple Hi. I’ve been following your tweets of late and I seem to like your sceptical view on most stocks. You mentioned that alpha lies in the small and mid cap space. Would you be will to share which specific stocks/sectors within this space look attractive?
579 2018-06-07 18:59:27 Ok. 

Going back to the start of the discussion, as long as you're making that call based on the facts (pension wise) then the decision is what it is. 
580 2018-06-07 18:59:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
581 2018-06-07 18:58:49

583 2018-06-07 18:57:45 We know there will be more gun murders in our future, but banning bump stocks would help make them less deadly.

591 2018-06-07 18:53:08 Bump-stocks, semi-autos, automatics...yeah...they kinda do. Face reality.  The 2nd Amendment doesn’t mean what you think it does.

602 2018-06-07 18:48:33 Ban bump stocks NOW!
603 2018-06-07 18:48:14 Big sell off in most Nasdaq stocks.

Its times like these that you stick to your strategy and not let emotion/fear take over. Accept the losses as mush as you take the wins, its all part of the game. Trust your system!

@traderstewie @armchairtweets @maginarydragons
604 2018-06-07 18:47:58 Agree.  I was referring to the principle that some clients won’t automatically be disadvantaged by Restricted.  Agree too; understanding and disclosure are key.
605 2018-06-07 18:46:48 Given the reaction in $U.to and the uranium stocks, it'll be easy to promote the fund and raise capital IMO. An over-subscribed offering would be VERY welcome!!
606 2018-06-07 18:45:30 I think any state to pass Sports Betting gonna help all the Gaming/Gambling stocks. $GMGI  still has more to come. Waiting on selling to stop, base, then add!
607 2018-06-07 18:45:15 On down days like this, I would spend more time analyzing the speculative glamours than the liquid glamours bc the speculatives do a better job of showing what the real sentiment is at the margin...at least at this stage of the cycle #stocks
608 2018-06-07 18:43:31 Haven’t you heard? It’s more like 25 years these days. So no pressure.

615 2018-06-07 18:41:18 While most of the #CAMJ investors / traders are seriously glued to the trading platforms - let’s lighten up the mood and do a quick poll :) 

Which one of these stocks you believe will turnaround first to green?

$CRON -4.2%, $TRST -4.11%, $APH -6.25%, $ACB -2.55%
616 2018-06-07 18:40:56 We need to ban bump stocks!
617 2018-06-07 18:40:38 Thank you! It’s wonderful 
618 2018-06-07 18:40:27 Agree @RAF_IFA BUT restricted could mean I don't do VCTs or I only sell pension (and nothing else) by one provider. 

Miles apart, restriction wise, but someone walks in with £10k one will get a different outcome to the other (one a pension).

Disclosure needs to be sorted!
619 2018-06-07 18:40:04 Few things warm my cold, cynical journalist’s heart, but catching up on news and pics of @DrDavidGK’s new arrival has filled me with absolute joy. Congrats Mr & Mr GK

Why does it take our Government soo long to actually DO anything?!?!!

629 2018-06-07 18:36:22 NEVER.   Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
630 2018-06-07 18:35:53 Being cynical, it's free cash from the the employer. 

Forget 'pension', it's a saving scheme you can cash in from 55 and payments in are doubled.

Ok, tax and affordability is involved, but unless investments bomb (a risk with all but cash), likelihood is its 'some free cash'.
631 2018-06-07 18:35:52 Typical dog whistle stuff from Labour - say “Dividends” and it’s intended to be a bad thing-forget that they tend to be paid as a distribution of Profit, which gets taxed - Pension funds are large holders of these stocks and we all benefit from that #schoolboypoliticsfromamatuers
632 2018-06-07 18:35:30 If there is a demo, I hope there's stocks, and 2 player off the bat.
633 2018-06-07 18:35:20 I just explained it. Shareholders make a voluntary exchange at IPO, time and risk for the prospect of money. Those who trade secondary stocks are buying that risk and delay. If you don't believe in private property that's another matter, otherwise you're selling future profit.

If cryptocurrencies are nothing more than bullshit digital Beanie Babies, it's only a matter of time before they're traded on Wall Street too.
636 2018-06-07 18:33:39 $SPY I'm not having any issues with the overall market. It's about (select) stocks AND good money management.
637 2018-06-07 18:32:34 You have to declare income, stocks, credits, etc. Because he's lying about his wealth and he and his family have clearly been making personal financial deals from OUR White House. Pure corruption. 

But you're not interested because you're a fan of his, right Mark?
638 2018-06-07 18:32:10 Ahaha k then x
639 2018-06-07 18:31:55 $CRON A good example of why I don't put that much focus on popular stocks that have already ripped higher in such a short time frame.

654 2018-06-07 18:27:13 If you look at your #charts and equity curve instead you will mostly see that everything is ok. Most #stocks are above their 20 MA, your equity curve is above the 20 MA. So what does the daily fluctuations of your equity curve means?

658 2018-06-07 18:23:36 Ban bump stocks
659 2018-06-07 18:23:07 Most all technology and industrial company's stocks are being trashed today 2% or more because wall street is a scam, fund managers and their clan decide to ignore financials completely and force a fire sale ripping off investors and IRAs.They blame investors which is a joke

671 2018-06-07 18:18:23 Stocks trading in mainland China have long offered one of market's biggest thrill rides — they've roughly doubled in just one year, only to give it all back the next — and they're moving into the mainstream of fund investing.

675 2018-06-07 18:16:30 Today is an abnormal trading day which means either a bull trap or a bear trap. How do I know? Because good stocks are tumbling while 'bad' stocks perfom very strong. Also fake $vix pump is another sign.
676 2018-06-07 18:16:27 Stocks maybe one small push higher next few days, but increasingly vulnerable to 1-2m correction. Too many failures and rest of world still weak.
677 2018-06-07 18:16:14 Former Fed Chairman Bernanke: Stocks are “a little bit overvalued, but not wildly.”
678 2018-06-07 18:16:09 China 40% discount or Original  15% discount ? Order now offer valid while stocks last
679 2018-06-07 18:15:36 Stocks trading in mainland China have long offered one of market's biggest thrill rides — they've roughly doubled in just one year, only to give it all back the next — and they're moving into the mainstream of fund investing.
680 2018-06-07 18:15:27 Bump stocks should be banned.  Why allow full auro shooting when full auto weapons are banned?
681 2018-06-07 18:15:12 So far today how some stocks in #CAMJ have traded, we very well can see Two Power Hours and on the contrary if technical rebound (selling pressure) doesn’t attract buyers back then we can be without any power hour.
682 2018-06-07 18:14:47 $IQ It’s nice to see at least one of my stocks up today. Market was due a selloff. The run up was really nice.
683 2018-06-07 18:14:20 Stocks trading in mainland China have long offered one of market's biggest thrill rides — they've roughly doubled in just one year, only to give it all back the next — and they're moving into the mainstream of fund investing.

685 2018-06-07 18:13:55 That ass hat had eight years and could and could not create the jobs, and bring down the unemployment, provide an environment with stocks thrive, bring businesses back from out of the country and get many of those countries to invest in America. Obuthurt didn't do any of this.
686 2018-06-07 18:13:48 Bump stocks must be banned as do all assault weapons.
687 2018-06-07 18:12:43 $BABA is one of those stocks I feel like we can open the Weekly chart in a few years and find the 50MA held support for the whole ride up lol
688 2018-06-07 18:11:44 Mid-Day: Stocks are off of their earlier levels, which S&P 500 and NASDAQ are further in the RED.  MBS is now up 9bps, potentially breaking above it's 25 DMA ceiling.  Yields have dropped down to 2.95% and it's 25 DMA floor is currently holding.
689 2018-06-07 18:11:44 Market opens risk on as financials track higher yields
• China says it does not want U.S. trade frictions to escalate - 
• Investors warm to UK stocks as M&A surges -

696 2018-06-07 18:08:44 Many tech stocks simultaneously coming into support now, and finding a bid it seems. Tentative.
697 2018-06-07 18:08:28 1) How many people do you honestly think are eating Tide Pods?
2) Which human right are you talking about? The right to bump stocks? The right to magazines of a particular capacity?
3) Do you honestly see needing to reload after firing 10 rounds as a loss of your human rights?
698 2018-06-07 18:07:55 @cheezwhiz 100% penny stocks are very dangerous, always gotta lock them up when you can!
699 2018-06-07 18:07:53 Ban bump stocks AND assault rifles!!
700 2018-06-07 18:07:45 why is everyone so ready to grow up? enjoy where u are now, embrace these days. soon they will just be memories
701 2018-06-07 18:06:12 13 is hardly anything to sneeze at from a spot $VIX perspective and I still believe stocks look good long-term. It's just these short-term periods where sentiment gets out of whack that often get corrected.
702 2018-06-07 18:06:04 Meanwhile, back in reality, employment is at a high not seen in 18 years (especially amongst minorities), participation in benefit programs is down as a result, illegal immigration is down, legal immigration is up, and stocks are still closing at record highs most of the time.
703 2018-06-07 18:05:18 How did it go?
704 2018-06-07 18:04:38 I figure $MGTX valued $15 per share and with a $14-$16 range it seems safe given the current market for GT stocks nice balance sheet and revenues.  How much damage could the aptamer route cause....$SLDB had bad press, lowered price range bigger size & still worked??
705 2018-06-07 18:04:08 By any chance are you telling people to invest on stocks related to poultry business 
706 2018-06-07 18:04:00 I know the truth gets in the way of your argument. Bush handed O an economy that was losing 750k jobs a MONTH remember that? Trump got an economy unemployment falling and stocks at all time highs. That’s facts!

753 2018-06-07 17:40:12 That you think of. Remember that these people have their hands in other markets like stocks and physical assets. News in our space effects other markets. Even if its not effecting us.
754 2018-06-07 17:39:35 Ban bump stocks, they serve no purpose other than making some guns more lethal. No good common sense need for them at all

757 2018-06-07 17:39:19 So mate you aren’t paying significantly more for gas in the last year. How about groceries? Harley is closing US plants, that is a fact. So is carrier, including the one Donny took credit for saving. You do understand that some stocks have dropped don’t you?
758 2018-06-07 17:38:36 You should spend less than 90mins/month on your investments. No following stocks or tv shows. 

I think the question is where are you getting these stories about investing from
759 2018-06-07 17:37:22 Last week, political volatility at home and abroad left its mark on stocks, commodities, and Treasury bonds...It started with Italy
760 2018-06-07 17:36:17 I will say banning bump stocks will most likely lead to banning all firearms. Since banning them would require redefining what a machine gun is. So no it doesn’t make sense. What does is enforcing current laws already in place.
761 2018-06-07 17:35:42 $upl re-loaded at 1.75, now back to 2.50 for a repeat! Very undervalued company. $oil $energy $stocks $chk $dnr $upl $nog $rig $evsv

763 2018-06-07 17:35:29 Justin Trudeau owns millions of dollars in marijuana stocks and shares. It's in a numbered corporation and not his name. This is why Justin Trudeau wants to legalize marijuana.  He is reeping the rewards of his new marijuana laws.
764 2018-06-07 17:35:12 @Abhishekkar_ Sir is it true that 46 stocks will be removed from f&o from july i.e. We wont be able to trade in their f&o from July. If its true then it is a horrible news for f&o traders.
765 2018-06-07 17:34:43 Clearly not. Ditched those snakes when I realised I’m not a bitch like that. Don’t pretend to like people only to bitch about them in college toilets like a 12 year old . The only ‘fuckin reptile’ is you, you ugly cunt 
766 2018-06-07 17:33:54 You’ve*
767 2018-06-07 17:33:42 At the same time, the best dividend paying stocks will give a little over 3%. Neither will provide the 7% pensions need.
768 2018-06-07 17:33:30 Index is only tracking the group of individuals stocks. Amid this rate hike index should fall but isn't, why?
769 2018-06-07 17:32:59 The same argument can be applied to bump stocks......
770 2018-06-07 17:32:52 The average holding time for stocks has dropped from 8 years in 1960 to 8 months in 2016, @shaich says @TheDealNewsroom #corpgov conference.
771 2018-06-07 17:32:46 Very intriguing, thank you for posting. It doesn't take into account the "rising tide lifting all boats" case we've seen in gold stocks in 2016 and market sentiment, correct?
772 2018-06-07 17:32:34 nice short oportunities are coming for JPY pairs and stocks. Nikkei at the hot zone
773 2018-06-07 17:32:28 That might be true. But is it gonna come at a cost of me obsessing over the news and stock market every minute and worrying that I'll lose my money ? If so, I would prefer to have peace of mind instead. If not, I'm all ears and open to learning about stocks.

786 2018-06-07 17:25:45 I trade stocks fairly often, but no, I didn't sell because of trump. Not yet. As long as the market's trending up I'm staying in. But if you don't think that's going to change, you're... well, I hate calling people fools.... so let's just say it's unwise.
787 2018-06-07 17:25:32 Is $BZQ keeps handing out free money 
788 2018-06-07 17:25:03 Bump stocks are absolutely useless you try to accurately hit anything from 50 yards with a bump stock on I’ll buy you lunch
789 2018-06-07 17:24:50 A little breather always comes in handy when many forget that in the short-term stocks go up and down not up or down.
790 2018-06-07 17:23:29 Very funny, the person that wants to be in cash and not in Stocks. Go hide it in your mattress
791 2018-06-07 17:22:51 My partner has stocks in his portfolio approaching 12 years old.  Our small cap team has held some biotechs since 2014.  For three years these particular biotechs underperformed.  Last year one was up 600%.
792 2018-06-07 17:22:18 I'm trying to be cautious and not to make wrong decisions during a days like today when $SPY and $QQQ are down. It's just a pullback after a long run. 
Find stocks with good relative strength. They always attract other traders. It's not a rocket science.
793 2018-06-07 17:21:42 I'm definitely for banning bump stocks.
794 2018-06-07 17:21:25 and yet Elise, you won't support responsible gun legislation that will ban bump stocks, assault military grade weapons, and expanded background checks.  Why?  Because you take NRA money to not support it. We're on to you. Tick Tock. @NY21Watchdog @NY21CTA @davidhogg111
795 2018-06-07 17:20:18 But someone like Shaqiri will still settle for it considering his stocks aren't high and could be playing in the Championship if no one comes calling. Doubt a club of Liverpool's stature will come in for him. No brainer for him.
796 2018-06-07 17:19:47 For example, this morning, i noticed that while indices were UP, many individual stocks wre falling or reversing... that's a warning sign especisally after the big run up we saw/ So i started to TIGHTEN STOPS aggressively! Took small loss on 1trade,
gain on 1 and flat on 1
797 2018-06-07 17:19:11 Yes ban bump stocks!

801 2018-06-07 17:18:17 Ban bump stocks.
802 2018-06-07 17:18:10 US stocks rallied out of the consolidation to new highs. There should be several attempts to rally till the end of the month, but I think we should see a topping structure from here. Expecting a selloff into July. $SPX
803 2018-06-07 17:17:24 Low jobs, stocks going up, and talking with NK, and trying to improve trade is all good yes.  But, just accept that many people will just always hate you.  Maybe just try to ignore them, and stop with the crazy shouting from the bell tower.
804 2018-06-07 17:16:25 @BrandonVanZee from @Market_Scholars just conducted an amazing class with 2 stocks in a head-to-head match-up.  PLEASE watch the recording if you missed the live class.  Better still, SIGN up on or before June 30th for the most value for your money!  (Can't beat the price.)
805 2018-06-07 17:16:24 El año pasado el salario mínimo (reajusta por una regla anterior) le ganó a la inflación y el gobierno liberó fondos (stocks extra presupuestarios) para pensiones. Ello generó un leve crecimiento del consumo, que con un pequeño aumento de las expo generó un crecimiento del 1%...
806 2018-06-07 17:16:21 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA? #FailForceOne #FakePresidentTrump
807 2018-06-07 17:15:12 Merci s'est pourvu en cassation. De toute façon les comprimés ancienne version ne sont plus produits et les stocks restants presque épuisés.  Cette procédure n'aboutira jamais
808 2018-06-07 17:14:44 Yeah I tried looking for it hahaha. Stocks are dangerous. Need to have a shredders mentality lol
809 2018-06-07 17:14:32 @KollolKabir where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
810 2018-06-07 17:13:30 Unless this intelligence came from a foreign source, it is as laughable as the US Journalism/Click Bait that sells it.  Both are international laughing stocks.. Much like the whole of the Fed Gov. #Corruption
811 2018-06-07 17:13:18 "In any case it’s quite clear that a big bull market in Gold will not begin or take place without first a bear market in stocks."  Jordan, please enlighten us on 2002 - 2007 where both stocks and gold rose together for years. Further, 2008 when stocks and gold plummeted together.

818 2018-06-07 17:10:40 As expected, Stocks open higher.
819 2018-06-07 17:10:34 After round 1 of 2 we're all almost fully invested and realize that a) there's now an incentive to weaken the hands of companies held by our opponents while b) selling off our vulnerable stocks and c) investing in stocks left undervalued in round 1.
820 2018-06-07 17:10:00 Not too surprising to see growth stocks get yanked; most were stretched, divergences abound and sentiment was bubbly. Seeing a little abnormal action today, but most retreats look normal at this point.
821 2018-06-07 17:08:55 If you can speak stocks and have some knowledge on how the stock market works, we’ll automatically click
822 2018-06-07 17:08:09 It shouldn’t. Just 1/PE then averaged and flipped back. So... P/E of 11 and 100 = yield of 9% and 1% = 5% average = 1/5% = P/E of 20 which makes sense as two stocks priced at $100 = $9 of earnings and $1 of earnings = $10 total earnings. $200 market cap = $10 earnings = 20x P/E
823 2018-06-07 17:06:56 when will you stop being NEGATIVE and post one POSITIVE tweet, your becoming worse than @cnn, its embarrassing Mark, please. Unemployment & black unemployment at all time lows, record breaking dow and stocks are great. GDP on a rise, should i keep going?
824 2018-06-07 17:05:44 It's a shame your using your platform to speak about shit you don't understand.   Stick to stocks or some shit
825 2018-06-07 17:05:37 Pullback phases can last anywhere from 2-6 weeks on average and while pullback phases in this market tend to be "short and sweet",they tend to do a lot of damage to many individual stocks.

Very important to remember, pullbacks are "necessary" and have to learn to welcome them
826 2018-06-07 17:05:26 #GGP #EVG performing well today. Almost on a bag with EVG now. Kind of switch off on these stocks and watch them rise
827 2018-06-07 17:05:17 I’m going to disagree about them doing more than any politician especially considering that bump stocks were just banned in Delaware a few days ago.
828 2018-06-07 17:04:49 Hi @hadleywickham , how does one build models in form of blocks? S/t a block contains attributes with constraints for each attribute eg {value x is int,x>0 ,a date time etc}. End result should be a model containing attributes such as Returns.stocks,returns.portfolio...
829 2018-06-07 17:04:28 That's also how I picked my stocks to invest in
830 2018-06-07 17:03:14 Looks like they have infinite stocks of snapdragon 625 cpu's

834 2018-06-07 17:02:05 I’ve tried all the ones people have already mentioned to you and although I don’t really use any of them anymore I feel like Acorns is the most mindless of them all but Robinhood is cool too if you wanna learn about stocks
835 2018-06-07 17:00:51 Sir, I believe you are mistaken.

The FANG stocks have never gone down. 
Never been down
Never stayed down. 

Free money.

838 2018-06-07 17:00:28 Missed the memo that today was the day everyone was supposed to hit the sell button on tech / cloud / IoT stocks..  Frustrating watching weeks of grinding out gains wiped in one day, but that’s how it goes sometimes ,, hopefully just profit taking after big runs.  #Investing
839 2018-06-07 16:59:52 OH my nigga I thought you were talkin about  corporation or some shit lmfao I’m like is he givin out stocks or some shit
840 2018-06-07 16:59:41 Here's a Better Question (Actually, 2.5)

1: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

2: When will you admit you had Putin rig the 2016 election because you're A power-hungry sociopath?
841 2018-06-07 16:59:21 Aww didn’t know ur Twitter or I would have done babe  oh... I meant Bitch...
842 2018-06-07 16:59:08 AND sometimes when you DO BUY FANG stocks
843 2018-06-07 16:59:05 Ban Bump Stocks....start there.
844 2018-06-07 16:58:48 Ban bump stocks. Why would you need one?
845 2018-06-07 16:58:25 This is what happens when you 
don’t buy FANG stocks.

847 2018-06-07 16:57:23 Investors take note : G-7 meets June 9. Pres @realDonaldTrump will attend. Although Europe has exploited good will of US for 50 years, leaders vigorously protest Trumps move to 'fair trade.' Like taking candy away from baby after years of overindulgence. Stocks may not like it.
848 2018-06-07 16:57:03 IPOs launched during a #VoidMoon don’t necessarily bring a corporation to its knees, but the overwhelming evidence she’s observed shows the stocks of these companies in the under-achiever category. #FinancialAstrology

851 2018-06-07 16:56:25 These are returns for the entire index (all the stocks) vs the P/Es (harmonic and average). This is the R2000G which contains most of the non-earners. Note the difference in x-axis. At one point it looked like average P/E was 200x and forward return was 4% annualized over 10.
852 2018-06-07 16:55:12 Yep. Ban bump stocks.
853 2018-06-07 16:54:10 Bump stocks should have been banned a long time ago just as automatic rifles!!!
854 2018-06-07 16:53:26 Please ban bump stocks!
855 2018-06-07 16:53:24 Ban bump stocks!!! Thank you for all your hard work.
856 2018-06-07 16:53:24 Why is banning bump stocks even a question!? It is illegally manipulating fire arms, OF COURSE they should be banned!!!
857 2018-06-07 16:53:16 I think stock is adjusting for bjp loss in 2019, tere kya hoga re sudhir?
858 2018-06-07 16:52:54 Hey, do you know what else is really bad?  That you said you would ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21, then didn't.  Are you afraid of the @NRA?

860 2018-06-07 16:51:26 I'm pretty sure I single handedly helped vodka stocks to rise! Although in hindsight, I wish I'd invested in them before election night. Oh and I no longer speak to most of my extended family.
861 2018-06-07 16:50:59 Honestly, I think hammer stocks are through the roof and bleach bit sales are booming. Record sales from the former White House staff buying new sims cards, tablets and phones. I hear destruction of devices as we speak
862 2018-06-07 16:50:54 And BTW... it wasn't the bump-stock, scope or bipod he had attached to his rifle that made him so deadly. It was the 10 bump-stocks, scopes & bipods he had attached to his 10 or so rifles that made him so deadly. But mostly the bump-stocks... bc he wasn't aiming, he was raining.

886 2018-06-07 16:43:13 I wish my @Target looked that good, mine is worse than that and we never got any Bowman Mega Boxes at the seven surrounding targets closest to me in ATL. Guessing the guy that stocks them decided to sell them himself.
887 2018-06-07 16:42:51 Hi Emma these were from our promotional range and only in while stocks last. But we’ll tell our Purchasing team that you were asking for them!
888 2018-06-07 16:41:52 Agree...we must ban bump stocks...

891 2018-06-07 16:40:50 Bump stocks 
892 2018-06-07 16:40:16 When workers go on strike the production stops. Stocks of goods are not thrown away. When farmers go on strike not only production stops but also the stocks are thrown out on the road. There are no remedies. Problem is unwieldable. Everyone brace yourselves for unknown calamity.
893 2018-06-07 16:40:05 Ban the damn bump stocks
894 2018-06-07 16:39:17 In last one month... Many have questioned my owned stocks and few had patience to hold them With me... My both stocks are only down 20% before bear mkt..

896 2018-06-07 16:37:58 1. Banning bump stocks is not a solution as anyone can use their belt loop for the same effect.  Rather
897 2018-06-07 16:37:05 “The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.”

- Peter Lynch
898 2018-06-07 16:36:47 Bump stocks are already banned in two states and in neither did more then 3 people turn it in out of a total of 30,000

901 2018-06-07 16:33:30 A rally in technology stocks came to a halt on Thursday, setting up the #Nasdaq for its first loss in five days, while a jump in McDonald's shares boosted the Dow. Shares of the world's biggest fast-food chain rose 3.7% after media reports.
902 2018-06-07 16:33:22 It’s not just greed on the part of Pharm. Corps but overall greed. Many ppl have these stocks in their portfolio. The focus of reform should be on Wall St. practices & get back to economic health measurements based on GNP not the Stock Market. Rich get richer, poor get poorer.

910 2018-06-07 16:31:52 What are the benefits of mass killings in civilized cultures? Perhaps bump stocks may not be the cause of rise in crime however, there’s no debating they are being used in mass murders. Care to comment?

934 2018-06-07 16:22:39 becouse, as i have said three times now, it is not increasing the total pool of wealth.  Day traders think stocks have value, but i see no reason they needs to be compensated either.

956 2018-06-07 16:17:19 @davidhogg111 stop bump stocks, enough!
957 2018-06-07 16:16:19 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your bipolar disorder
958 2018-06-07 16:14:23 Not just economy. 
- ISIS in serious decline
- NOKO willing to talk instead of threatening us with missiles
- unemployment at record lows
- law and order being restored (albeit slowly)
- consumer confidence at record high
- stocks at record high

Which of these are you against?

966 2018-06-07 16:10:35 So, how far have the stocks dropped since YOU'VE been in office? 2000 points?? How HIGH have gas prices RISEN since YOU'VE been in office?? And the reason employment is low is because so many people have just stopped looking for work! Way to stay in touch, DUMBASS!!

971 2018-06-07 16:09:45 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
972 2018-06-07 16:09:35 The DA should be charged and locked away. I'd be willing to guess that DA holds stocks in for profit prisions too.
973 2018-06-07 16:09:35 Banning Bump Stocks will save lives.  It’s our moral duty to do so.

979 2018-06-07 16:06:08 Years ago, I was taught (at JLL) that #RealEstate must have an additional 2% return above the yield on alternative investment forms (stocks and shares) to reflect higher acquisition/sale costs and transaction times. That was for well-let #CRE.
For #BTL that should probably be 4%.
980 2018-06-07 16:05:46 Yard darts are banned. Bump stocks need to be banned.

986 2018-06-07 16:04:36 Added 2 Trillion to the national debt in 500 days. Prices going up. Richest Americans still have carried interest loophole. Companies still buying back stocks instead of raising salaries.....
987 2018-06-07 16:04:24 And Mark's return assumptions for stocks & bonds are likely far too optimistic. So 7% assumption is likely even more of a pipedream.
988 2018-06-07 16:04:01 $SPY Listen to news for trading help. Cramer said they lie to news media to sway stocks. Got to be high on crack to listen  that garbage.
989 2018-06-07 16:03:20 Just said most working people have retirement connected to stocks, if stocks go up, that is good. Yes people who own more of them are affected more just like they are taxed more etc. but you are entitled your opinion just wish we didn’t have to insult. Have a nice day
990 2018-06-07 16:03:07 I'm just still confused as to why the cryptocurrency market flips out over the word "security". Stocks, bonds, etc are all securities. You can buy them without investor accreditation. So why is it that you bring up "securities" and everyone claims the market will crash. ????
991 2018-06-07 16:02:50 @vladstocks How many stocks would you say is to many to be invested in?

1005 2018-06-07 15:57:25 I would not be putting new money to work here on a slight pullback in pillar stocks thinking they will bounce back.  Just my opinion
1006 2018-06-07 15:57:16 Ban bump stocks now!
1007 2018-06-07 15:57:16 Taking away bump stocks is constitutional and does not prevent someone from practicing their second amendment rights. Banning bump stocks is the next step to making our communities safer.
1008 2018-06-07 15:56:51 .....stocks up on coffee and donuts
1009 2018-06-07 15:56:51 In a different exercise I did years ago a small cap portfolio did fantastic, but the return was due to the domination of a few winners in the final outcome. Something like 70-80% of the portfolio value was in 3-4 stocks at the end point. Big winners & high mortality combined.
1010 2018-06-07 15:56:46 $STMP holding good on a down day for tech stocks. Raised my stop loss to break-even point.

1022 2018-06-07 15:52:20 TBH, this happened in the early 2000's virtually every quarter for @RedHat ... the stocks will bounce back within 7-10 days with an increase if they follow the RHT trend of 15 years ago.

1025 2018-06-07 15:50:48 The personal finance stuff is kind of ridiculous. CFP, CPAs, tax advisors all have a role to play. Just let me Rock these Stocks to maxxx
1026 2018-06-07 15:49:58 Issue is with $PAB just for clarification haha NOT the poster. In saying that, I’ll never allow my past emotions or experiences get in the way of a potential FUTURE trade. Plus, I need a chance to take revenge on it as I’ve done so on afew other stocks turning losses into gains.
1027 2018-06-07 15:49:50 I got into stocks maybe a year ago...
1028 2018-06-07 15:48:52 If you like growth stocks that are absurdly cheap that are producing tangible kpi’s & where we now the size of the market and where one can forecast cash flows / earnings assuming execution then look st Altitude
1029 2018-06-07 15:48:43 HAHAHAHAHA, sorry guys!!! Wala nami'y stocks huhubellz
1030 2018-06-07 15:48:29 This is temporary prop-up of the stock-market. Corps are using the new tax rule—a (supposedly) one-time "repatriation" of the cash they hid over-seas—to buy their own stocks. But after this rigamarole, their stocks will need some real valuation and real buyers.
1031 2018-06-07 15:47:40 Which store stocks these?
1032 2018-06-07 15:47:27 How bout because bump stocks have not been used in any of those school shootings?
1033 2018-06-07 15:47:19 Burnol stocks will exhaust but these burns will not get cured 
1034 2018-06-07 15:47:13 While the rhetoric is humming in the background (on both sides) America is prospering.  The economy is great, unemployment almost nonexistent, stocks up, rebuilding America, better border security,  fair trade now coming, nuclear war averted, and Trump's approval ratings good.
1035 2018-06-07 15:46:52 We need more than just a ban on bump stocks. We need reform across the board. Thank you for working so hard to make change.
1036 2018-06-07 15:46:07 $HMNY the sellers are gone today definitely looks like it's getting in the .40s
1037 2018-06-07 15:45:37 Ban Bump stocks!  #BanBumpStocks (and #BanBullfighting too since it came up and it's really cruel)
1038 2018-06-07 15:45:03 Very likely. On 9/11 they were buying stocks like crazy the day bfore in order to make some big money off of this tragedy...money over people's lives is the name of the game. These people r murderers!!!
1039 2018-06-07 15:44:48 Ok, listen here. The National Rifle Association was formed in 1871 before large guns like sub machine guns and bump stocks came into play. Now we have that . I understand the need of handguns to defend yourself, but not a machine gun. Be quiet.
1040 2018-06-07 15:44:23 Stocks at all time high, unemployment is all time low, tax reform, North Korea stop nuclear weapons and construction is booming. Still want the guy out of office? Wow! Could cure cancer you still want him out.
1041 2018-06-07 15:44:20 If you are a U.S. investor, dollar going up or down does not impact your stock or bond performance. Domestic investors buying U.S. stocks & selling U.S. bonds has no impact on the USD.
1042 2018-06-07 15:43:54 Any investment vehicle bought today to sell tomorrow is about increasing purchasing power. Doesn’t matter if it’s Euro. Stocks. Bonds. Collectibles. Oil. Rice. Bitcoin. Steem. So no need to speak to this like it’s an issue.
1043 2018-06-07 15:43:48 by the time you get the numbers you want the sp will be multiples of what it is right now. Go ask VCs how they value startups and apply the same logic to this. No different other than this is publicly listed on AIM (where 95% of stocks are shite)
1044 2018-06-07 15:43:41 .@ShakHill wrote books on financial planning & has been in financial services for 20+ years yet on his House Financial Disclosure lists no real assets.

1049 2018-06-07 15:41:49 Where has the common sense gone in America?   Banning bump stocks is not disarming America.   It curbs the amount of potential damage one shooter can inflict at one time.   Also makes a shooter more vulnerable to counterattack.   Common sense.
1050 2018-06-07 15:41:48 The potential  here is too big for checking out for a few hundred quid...  if anyone is in now might as well wait till at ,east 1.5p or higher to take profit #GGP

1055 2018-06-07 15:40:24 Quite the difference in discussion about AR15 vs Bump Stock.  Yes the NRA supports banning bump stocks.  Why make a State law when there is a Federal law to enforce?  Do you like living in a country that regulates everything you do at every level of Govt?  Sounds Orwellian to me.
1056 2018-06-07 15:40:03 Stalking $OPHT for later.

1072 2018-06-07 15:34:24 Yes I understand that semi automatic weapons are commonly owned... you can also modify semi automatic weapons to fire automatically or use things like bump stocks to simulate automatic fire. Why do you need a weapon that can fire at a high rate of speed and high cap magazines?
1073 2018-06-07 15:33:46 Bump stocks have no legitimate or positive purpose. Ban them.

1091 2018-06-07 15:26:45 Those taxcuts and other tweeks that they did will start to show by the end of his presidency or 1-2years after. Things will starts to show. The big corps have already stated the money the save goes back into the stocks not to the workers. Or to improve pay.
1092 2018-06-07 15:26:20 #LIEGATE #deflecting #Russiagate #WorstPresidentEver Why haven't you banned bump stocks? Are you afraid of the NRA?

1094 2018-06-07 15:26:08 I've been "not selling" gold stocks for 8 years. Maybe one day there will be eventual gains..

1096 2018-06-07 15:26:06 Meaning of Value Buying has changed among the class of investors who are taught to invest in same asset all the time.
"Index fund investors buy cheap stocks and expensive stocks (part of the index) indiscriminately"
1097 2018-06-07 15:24:23 So far, as you'd expect, this bounce is being led by those groups that were strong earlier in the day, i.e. $XLF and more generally $SPX / $SPY. The weaker stocks, i.e. $NYFANG / $NDX / $QQQ not so much.

1103 2018-06-07 15:22:28 I don't think Ethereum is a scam but it has no use case, therefore heavily overvalued. Its copycats also have no use case so same. Monero is a good idea but may be centralized. ICOs are penny stocks with very low chance of executing and no accountability.

1109 2018-06-07 15:19:13 Well people do not understand that corporations have record level debts, have given up on making a profits the old fashioned way, rely on debt, and make money through "regulatory profits," buy back their own stocks to falsely inc their own stock price, and create phony bonuses.
1110 2018-06-07 15:19:05 It’s valid for the 10 days of days of play, so 8th-18th June or while stocks last :)

1115 2018-06-07 15:18:04 Question for #finance geeks, when a company lists a number for Stockholders of record, is this reflective of ALL individuals that own at least one share or is this number low due to things like transfer agents, banks, investment funds, etc? #stocks #NYSE

1123 2018-06-07 15:15:20 It's not just a humantarian crisis, it's a monumentally stupid system. Trump, Kelly & Sessions don't care about people. They do care about looking stupid & having that pointed out. That needs to be a focus of the coverage. Make 'em laughing stocks.
1124 2018-06-07 15:15:16 Title should actually say "stocks set to possibly deliver sub-par returns whether you index or not but you will likely do a little better by paying the lowest costs if those sub-par returns come true".

1139 2018-06-07 15:11:52 I do understand how growth stocks work...but at some point the market will need some tangible to hang its had on..2025 assuming 5% market share and a marker worth X with a margin structure of Y it is worth this. We have had nothing tangible as of yet & ergo I am not long

1143 2018-06-07 15:11:11 Well they don't really want that right for everyone--GOP is currently attacking banks that won't lend to gun retailers that don't do background checks or sell bump stocks. They want to discriminate, but not be discriminated against. A deep hypocrisy underlies this whole fight...

1224 2018-06-07 14:45:26 Bitcoin & crypto is mostly a cash market. It's money that serfs would have otherwise just spent on more pizza and marijuana cigarettes. I think the dollar spike theory is nonsense but even if it happens, crypto won't be inverse to it like levered stocks.

1231 2018-06-07 14:44:17 They are easy to find.  Stocks tab, swing trader newsletter, then scroll down to Under the Hood section.
1232 2018-06-07 14:43:16 Ban bump stocks now. Save lives!

1241 2018-06-07 14:41:20 My company bought back $1 billion in stocks, gave no bonuses then did layoffs
1242 2018-06-07 14:41:10 Yes, wages grew just 8 cents/ hr. 1st quarter 2018, gas prices higher, stocks volatile due to uncertainty with tariffs, goods will soon cost more due to tariffs, interest rates rising. But you are correct, the 1% got $84 BILLION in tax cuts & corps. are using for stock buybacks.
1243 2018-06-07 14:40:59 a lot of volume on the selling in max list stocks
1244 2018-06-07 14:40:54 Gives us more opportunities to reevaluate our opinions on the companies and the stocks and more trading opportunities.  While it increases volatility somewhat, analyst estimates are just that.  Company guidance gives us a concrete picture to base valuations on.

1246 2018-06-07 14:40:28 great lesson...  I've learned to lower my size on spready stocks.  The spread can be your best friend or your worst enemy.
1247 2018-06-07 14:40:17 So @WarrenBuffett & #JamieDimon want to do away with quarterly corporate guidance. But but you can't ban analysts from issuing theirs! (We're still a free country!) What #CEO is going to want to leave their stocks' performance 100% in the hands of analysts !!?

1328 2018-06-07 14:19:13 My selfishly favorite part of their recent update is the potential for tokenization or regular stocks with instant settlement and 24/7 trading.  That will bring over traditional equity investors who will then dabble in crypto.

1346 2018-06-07 14:13:52 Seriously, happy to answer any questions about stocks/investing. But the general advice for most is going to be dollar average in and just buy the indexes.
1347 2018-06-07 14:13:51 You mean those stocks that recovered all those losses and are even higher now?
The stock market is a long term gain, only people selling into fear lost there.

1381 2018-06-07 14:03:40 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1424 2018-06-07 13:55:05 Property rights are the most efficient way of dealing with 'the tragedy of the commons'. We are much more likely to pollute an environment that no-one owns than we are to pollute our own property. Sustainability of fishing stocks could be addressed by privatizing the oceans.

1430 2018-06-07 13:54:44 I can't advise on stocks, but I can advise that if you invest 10% of your money in the stock market, you will not miss the 10%, and you will build a future. Major tech companies. Netflix, Apple, Amazon, make me over 20% a year. Creatives should be doing business with their money.
1431 2018-06-07 13:53:47 Just like no one would pay Gates billions for his savings, they wouldn't pay him billions for the labor he put into Microsoft alone. The valuation includes the labor of others and capital stocks invested over time.
1432 2018-06-07 13:53:23 Over the last few months, some of the players whose stocks have risen the most are Zhaire Smith, Donte DiVincenzo, Josh Okogie, Khyri Thomas & Kevin Huerter.

1464 2018-06-07 13:43:48 I assume you mean if you keep doubling down you eventually lose? Because if you spread out investments in 10 stocks over 5 years, where the market performs 8%/yr, and one of your stocks goes to 0, you still outperform the market if the other stocks beat 10.25%/yr

1471 2018-06-07 13:42:55 @ClementsMoney @ryan_mcc2015 But if you have a portfolio of 10 stocks like he says and make a big bet on each (let’s say 100k) plus 9 are huge winners, the 10th won’t vaporize your returns because you can only lose your initial investment.  The other nine can gain exponentially.

That's what people miss, 99% of stocks are owned by the top 10%, the bottom 90%? 1%
1512 2018-06-07 13:27:38 Ban the bump stocks dammit.
1513 2018-06-07 13:27:01 Ban bump stocks
1514 2018-06-07 13:26:34 This year is somewhat unique because of how volatile the market had been during the late winter and spring. Stocks sold off during the historically strong period as investors fretted about rising inflation, more restrictive trade policies and the longevity of the tech stock rally
1515 2018-06-07 13:26:29 Time to bring back the stocks, a mediaeval punishment for a mediaeval mindset.
1516 2018-06-07 13:25:47 We do not need bump stocks.  Ban them.
1517 2018-06-07 13:24:46 6) - Hedge to traditional markets (Bitcoin doesnt move like other markets and so may be a good hedge - if major funds moved 1-10% of clients money from stocks into Bitcoin, that would make it worth 1-10tril)
- Speculative asset (derivatives worth between 544 tril- 1.4 quadril)
1518 2018-06-07 13:24:23 5) - Assets, securities and copyright on the blockchain (stocks: around 70tril/real estate: around 217 tril/copyright ownership: around 1.2 tril/year)
- escaping capital controls by autocracies
1519 2018-06-07 13:24:01 I don’t get it. If the senior management would belive in Elon’s promises- why would they then leave the company with millions in unvested stocks going worthless upon departure of the company. Nobody walks out on a furtune like that. @markbspiegel

1521 2018-06-07 13:23:42 "If you had bought the Nasdaq pretty late in the game, and held on, you still would have beaten the S&P 500."

1647 2018-06-07 12:44:06 Bump stocks have no useful purpose in the civilian world. No one needs an apparatus that allows a gun to have a large capacity fire power. They need to be banned.

1650 2018-06-07 12:43:29 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1651 2018-06-07 12:43:29 Stand up for what's right ban bump stocks.
1652 2018-06-07 12:43:16 There is no rational reason why there is a need for bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks

1655 2018-06-07 12:41:50 Stocks move now on headlines, etc - whatever goes into the algos - rather than just the quarterly meet/beat of it. And that’s BEFORE taking into account “adjusted” (i.e. FAKE) results designed to make things look better than they really are.

1657 2018-06-07 12:41:02 BAN BUMP STOCKS, which only make any weapon worse!!!
1658 2018-06-07 12:40:16 Bump stocks is a good first step that is not very controversial.

1666 2018-06-07 12:34:13 If you couldn't profit off of stocks would ppl care about them? And there's also a lot of ppl that care about the tech. I think there's a legit place for a stablecoin, and I'd use it if it gained adoption. Of course I also want to make money on my investments.

1668 2018-06-07 12:32:13 There is new trend in market
Promoters start buying own stake each quarter with increasing profits and sales for whole year, which resulted higher stocks prices because people attract by seeing promoters buying with increased revenue.
1669 2018-06-07 12:32:06 No more bump stocks.
1670 2018-06-07 12:30:31 Yes, ban bump stocks now.
1671 2018-06-07 12:30:24 Typo - socks s/b stocks 
1672 2018-06-07 12:29:16 Adam you are 100% correct. This company has proven to be what is expected in the OTC nothing more. The same excuse by leadership used by most of the other stinky pinky penny stocks. The continuous failure to get filings done in time says all you need to know. Not that hard folks.
1673 2018-06-07 12:29:09 BAN BUMP STOCKS ASAP!!!!!  PLEASE!!!!
1674 2018-06-07 12:29:04 You & yr party are out of touch. 
FYI- more than 50% of Americans are savvy investors & they have some sort of investment vehicle in the stock market - mutual funds, 401K’s, IRA’s, pension funds as well as socks. Buybacks are good for stocks & increase the wealth of Americans. 
1675 2018-06-07 12:28:50 To expand on this directly here, shareholders are a company’s capitol representation. When you’re as big as Microsoft, the R&D - for example - is only to drive a company’s stocks up. Meaning, the company’s main product is getting more shareholders.

1753 2018-06-07 11:52:46 The problem with banning bumps stocks is that there is no law to ban them. It fits the definition of semi-automatic... it just fires semi-auto faster. You can do the same thing with a belt loop or your finger with practice - should we ban those too?

Why don't they sell US stocks, bonds, etc instead? Shorting paper futures is to drive the price of the anti-dollar, Gold lower.

1921 2018-06-07 10:31:39 If GE is what happens when a company is super-focused on quarterly earnings, and Amazon is what happens when a company is super-focused on the long term, doesn't the divergent market fortunes of the two stocks undermine their argument?

1932 2018-06-07 10:26:56 Thats so often the trouble with AIM & FTSE small cap stocks especially when poor news (not in RFX's cae) strikes and does add to the risk management worry in terms of selling anything above the NMS. Many times I have to split sales down into "managable bites".

1938 2018-06-07 10:23:03 Over past 1 year net flows into Intermediate bond open end funds is 134 Billion. Retail sees that market conditions are positive for stocks so here comes that last leg higher. (Retail always last in). 12-18 months.
1939 2018-06-07 10:21:52 3. Obviously sensitive subject for twitter (sorry) but there are many pension myths and I've met many who have made decisions based on them.

1942 2018-06-07 10:20:40 2. Generalising but even if prognosis for someone isn't great, pensions shouldn't necessarily be discounted (especially workplace where contributions effectively doubled by govt and employer).

#ClosingBell: Post the gap up opening, Nifty continued to soar high, in the last one hour Index cooled off from higher levels due to profit booking in the banking stocks.

1946 2018-06-07 10:19:37 Because stricter gun laws equate to safer streets? This is a not true. Bump stocks were for the people who wanted to simulate automatic fire but can't afford to go through the process. My previous post was showing how hypocritical Justin is and how you got your own problems in CA
1947 2018-06-07 10:19:33 1. Apologies for being a bit direct but are you aware pensions can usually be drawn early if due to serious ill health. Plus if someone dies before 75 all pension benefits paid are completely tax free? A
1948 2018-06-07 10:19:18 Always need to remember this.  In studying, so many stocks that I consider seem to hit, of course, I eliminate them and choose others.

1953 2018-06-07 10:13:14 It's never good to just invest in one stock. You need a varied portfolio, and you need to study chart patterns and the prices of stocks you influence.

2013 2018-06-07 09:36:18 Have to invest heavily into stocks.  Govt needs to cut unnecessary entitlement spending & invest more money into social security.  In extreme approach perhaps get rid of 401K’s in corporations, have all businesses and individuals invest instead into social security.
2014 2018-06-07 09:34:52 Of course, no brainer, ban bump stocks.  If someone has a minute could you explain how comments on Twitter could accomplish this?

2063 2018-06-07 08:55:56 Although #Nifty has sustained above 10770 and broken previous channel; Looking at FNO Stocks, rally doesn't seem sustainable. Feels like we will have a down day going forward; At least for few days till further clarity on trend is there. Last two months were whipsaws. Cautious.
2064 2018-06-07 08:55:53 There is no general answer for this.  It depends on the stock/ business. Speculative stocks should be avoided from the investment universe for they are more volatile and over a long period, the chances of making money in them are much less than those of losing money.

2246 2018-06-07 06:48:21 @sebi_india Circuit Fitters are very odd. Some stocks rise or fall quickly in one directionbut very slowly in opposite direction on recovery (20>10>5% <5%<5%<5%). Some other always fall or rise very slowly at 5%. This it bit injustice since stocks lag behind. Pls look n correct.
2247 2018-06-07 06:47:41 Yikes ! That’s the thing with stocks; it’s very tricky. I don’t like for people to go big when the first jump into the game especially if they don’t know what’s exactly going on. But it’s really about watching stocks like the news

2319 2018-06-07 05:58:03 No just saw random stocks
2320 2018-06-07 05:57:14 Given the narratives, this is pretty shocking:

Kevin Durant, 2018 Finals: 31.7 points, 10.3 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 2.4 stocks, 69.6% TS

2322 2018-06-07 05:56:27 Bump stocks are just a tool to get around the law, like radar detectors, except that they increase the number of possible deaths way more then speeding.

2326 2018-06-07 05:53:49 @ETNOWlive @ETNOWlive see brilliant analyst( expert) Vikas Sethi is giving buy call on graphite India today, it s @ multiyear high, why he is always recommending stocks after rally of 1000 percent in last two years.
    U hv to analyze his earlier recommendations in etnow.
2327 2018-06-07 05:53:09 Ban Bump Stocks...
2328 2018-06-07 05:53:00 If money is speech, as SCOTUS says... Where does gambling fit in? Shouldn't I be allowed to voice my opinion on next roll of the dice, turn of the cards or valuation of stocks? The more laws they make to restrict our freedoms, the less sense they make & more conflicts with logic.
2329 2018-06-07 05:52:58 Ban bump stocks!
2330 2018-06-07 05:52:55 Ban bump stocks.
2331 2018-06-07 05:52:34 Ban bump stocks! RT
2332 2018-06-07 05:52:27 Machine guns R not outlawed. In fact it’s still leagal to own them. Just plan on a pretty insane background check and about $50k. Bump stocks on the other hand just make a rifle bounce back and forth. Take em away and people will still create them with their fingers & belt loops.
2333 2018-06-07 05:51:20 Ban bump stocks. While you're at it, please consider allowing CDC to gather data on gun deaths, increase and improve background checks, and BAN ASSAULT (STYLE) RIFLES.
Thanks.
2334 2018-06-07 05:50:42 Axis MF has a fund that has 17k cr AUM spread very decent across just 37 stocks. Fully invested with a small holding in bonds.

2339 2018-06-07 05:48:45 what do you mean its like you are saying the stocks were the highest ever, most full time employed ever in US history and unemployment was dropping like its hot.  No way.  Oh its true.  And oh Trumps budgets didn't even go into effect until October so even 2017 was under Obama.
2340 2018-06-07 05:48:23 Ban bump stocks!
2341 2018-06-07 05:48:20 We need to ban bump stocks
2342 2018-06-07 05:48:05 Because it requires the definition of machine gun to change into something it’s not. What bump stocks do can be repeated with a finger and a belt loop. Stop blaming the tool.
2343 2018-06-07 05:48:04 Hater part was not meant for you btw @SMetaldave64 I have seen a lot of YouTube videos and posts saying their e3 will be bad because stocks. Short sited to think e3 is the only factor to consider in this scenario.
2344 2018-06-07 05:47:27 Mark, please publish the list of stocks you short. I want to build the douche-bag-bro index fund.
2345 2018-06-07 05:46:51 Bump stocks modify rifles to fire faster, repetitive rounds, mimicking a fully automatic machine gun.There were 58 people killed in Las Vegas & over 500 were injured from 10:08pm-10:19pm. Bump stocks were on the shooters guns, unspeakable bloodshed.Ban bump stocks.
2346 2018-06-07 05:46:47 And it helps the poor by telling them to pay tithing even if it means their kids go hungry. Meanwhile the church holds $33 BILLION in stocks alone. Takes in $7billion tithing, donates just $40 million to the poor.

2353 2018-06-07 05:44:30 Definitely need to ban bump stocks!
2354 2018-06-07 05:43:35 How stupid do you have to be to say to the world that a vicious dictator begged for something just before you send your boss into a meeting with him?The @GOP will be known for the lowest level of uneducated people in history for many generations to come. They are laughing stocks.
2355 2018-06-07 05:43:15 No bump stocks!
2356 2018-06-07 05:42:43 Expert Advice: #Nifty managed to close positive despite rate hike by RBI. The overall tone  will remain positive but after carnage in Smallcap and Midcap stocks we  need to see some consolidation or range bound action.
2357 2018-06-07 05:41:56 The problem is, if you ban bump stocks. You will have effectively redefined machine gun to include all semi automatic firearms . And therefore made all firearms illegal. Not sure how that fits into your definition of the #2ndAmendment
2358 2018-06-07 05:41:00 Ban bump stocks! For real!
2359 2018-06-07 05:40:43 Bump stocks are a deliberate violation of most state laws and should be banned nationwide
2360 2018-06-07 05:40:36 Only an idiot would find a problem with banning bump stocks.
2361 2018-06-07 05:39:59 stocks and bonds

If you recall, this started with the idea that since the market is up, it must be good for ppl. Well, it’s good for those of us who own stocks but most of USA doesn’t own many at all.
2368 2018-06-07 05:33:54 Bump stocks aren’t made for hunting anything. Just like cars aren’t made for killing.

2455 2018-06-07 04:38:44 This is half of the truth. The other half is that Trump's electoral stocks are rising month by month, and the GOP may well hold the House. It's  the collision of these two sets of facts that produces that creepy end-times feeling...
2456 2018-06-07 04:38:14 Other than stocks exchange, which other exchanges do you use/trust for those coins?
2457 2018-06-07 04:38:01 Bump stocks must be banned
2458 2018-06-07 04:37:42 #momsDemandAction says we can and will create common sense gun laws to save lives. Banning Bump Stocks is a common sense gun law that will save lives.

2464 2018-06-07 04:34:56 True sir, That's what it lured me in, plus it was an index etf, I been a passive investor, and an excellent opportunity to invest 1 apple a day in FAAANG stocks. Somehow the liquidity has evaporated lately. I have highlighted it to @AashishPS  sir, he is looking in this matter.
2465 2018-06-07 04:33:04 Ban bump stocks!  Ban swatting!  Ban Trump!  Ban Bannon!

2479 2018-06-07 04:28:43 No unpleasant experience. It's just that you say deliveries in 7-12 days for products that you have stocks anyway. In today's competitive environment, do you think that's a good idea? I therefore only order stuff on your site that I don't find on @amazonIN
2480 2018-06-07 04:28:21 Hold. Don’t sell stocks that you’ve seen perform when they are in a slump.

"Availability of stocks" will ensure it.

2487 2018-06-07 04:24:09 I am saying there is a pretty clear correlation between almost all stocks that Klaus gets involved in. Those in early around his entry price tend to make a lot of money.

2509 2018-06-07 04:09:32 At first I kinda found the $AVZ stuff funny, now it’s just sad. People lost a lot there buying the hype.

$WFE the next on the list to succumb to the social media pump. 

See people complaining stocks like $NZC aren’t promoted enough... Underpromise, overdeliver is fine by me.
2510 2018-06-07 04:09:09 Einstein, in order to grow the economy, you need to have slot of people exchanging money, not 1%.  When you give tax breaks to corps, they don’t spend it.  They invest in their business and buy back stocks to value.  Econ 101
2511 2018-06-07 04:09:00 Hey @Apple... #iOS12 looks great, however let’s chill with the Stocks app on iPad and let’s FINALLY add a Calculator app! How TF do you market the iPad as a MacBook replacement, but don’t include a native Calculator app, when you have one on other iOS devices??

2516 2018-06-07 04:07:06 I own these Chinese stocks. $IQ $WB $WUBA $BABA and $DQ.  DQ isn't going as well as the others....
2517 2018-06-07 04:06:23 Still I say bet slowly on good balance sheet,high growth midcaps. I'm not too much carried away with fast rise nor fast fall. 

'தாமரை இலையில் நீர் போல்,மிக வேகமான ஏற்றமும் & இறக்கமும் பாதிக்காது' on stocks where I have fairly decent conviction.
2518 2018-06-07 04:05:35 this market is epic. So many 52 week high stocks from names we all expected in sectors we all expected.  I would say it's easy money, but that would clearly mark the top :)

2527 2018-06-07 04:01:30 Ban bump stocks. Citizens do not need assault weapons or accessories to make hunting guns assault weapons for any reason!
2528 2018-06-07 04:01:21 Rapid fire guns should only be used in war. Bump stocks help terrorists kill more people.
2529 2018-06-07 04:01:17 It had a great day today

2536 2018-06-07 03:56:33 Marijuana is getting legalized this week holy fuck!!!! Hoping I made the right decision to invest on pot stocks.

2538 2018-06-07 03:56:07 Bump stocks are immoral; their only purpose is to make killing people faster, in greater numbers and easier. No hunter or marksman would ever need this device
2539 2018-06-07 03:55:40 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2540 2018-06-07 03:55:03 Call stocks/sectors as defensives. Buy them like crazy. Raise valuations to crazy level. Make them defenseless. Dump them. Repeat! IT and consumer now defensive stocks.

2544 2018-06-07 03:54:43 “The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.”

2546 2018-06-07 03:53:08 Well I do care, which is why I don’t want guns banned. I agree bump stocks won’t save lives, but guns do. Millions of people need a gun for defense, and I’m sure it’s saved quite a few of their lives. Banning guns will only get more people killed.
2547 2018-06-07 03:52:26 Let’s shove all the bump stocks into trump’s you know what.
2548 2018-06-07 03:52:17 Bump stocks should be banned.  Enough said.

Mexico's benchmark stock index plummeted 7.6% in May, biggest one-month decline since Feb '09. Mexico's exchange-traded fund, EWW, plunged 13.4%, largest loss since 2011
2563 2018-06-07 03:45:32 A good day for the bulls but will rates curtail the party? 10yr is back near 3%. FANG stocks paused while financials surged & IYT woke up -a positive going forward. Q’s and IWM are we n overbought territory so some digestion would be welcome before the next leg up.

2569 2018-06-07 03:42:22 Maybe so, but people do the same with stocks. When a mass shooting happens gun stocks go up. They make a profit but doesn’t mean the contribute to gun crime or support it.

2611 2018-06-07 03:27:53 Take yourself back to before the financial crisis experts would have told you to invest in stocks just before the stock market tumbled by about 50%, these are the people who said UK should take up the euro, and many other things point to "experts" no getting many decisions right.

Always good to remember , winners keep winning !

Same applies to many good stocks.........
2625 2018-06-07 03:24:28 Ban semiautomatic rifles, bump stocks, or any other device that allows semis to become automatic.  If the automatic rifle if outlawed, then why not the semiautomatics?!  Same thing with an additional device.
2626 2018-06-07 03:24:03 BAN BUMP STOCKS!
2627 2018-06-07 03:23:48 Bump stocks are not for hunting nothing ..xcept humans ban them
2628 2018-06-07 03:23:41 I agree with banning bump stocks. Another issue I guess I disagree with him on.
2629 2018-06-07 03:23:27 BTW- time to shift focus on what we call "leaders". this late in the cycle, with credit stress popping up, it's no longer mega cap growth stocks (FANG) driving the bus, it's financials.
2630 2018-06-07 03:22:38 Lol! I didn't even put that together. Let's see. What should I say? Hidden gold? Hidden stocks & bonds? Help me out dudes!
2631 2018-06-07 03:22:05 I understand the News one to be more like a service especially having Ads but I don’t see the reasoning for the Stocks app other than consistency with News? Kinda dumb if that’s the reason.
2632 2018-06-07 03:21:55 Ban bump stocks NOW!
2633 2018-06-07 03:21:44 Provide me someone’s email or phone number who I can speak with who strictly purchase their long term stocks in 1999.  Please, I mean it.
2634 2018-06-07 03:21:37 Ban bump stocks!
2635 2018-06-07 03:21:17 Bam bump stocks now!
2636 2018-06-07 03:21:06 #PaddockNeverFired1Shot #LiberalMedia blackout is deafening and speaks volumes  #SorosIsSatan purchased $42M in puts & MGM CEO sold 85% of his stocks 30-days before massacre #TheyKnew
2637 2018-06-07 03:20:57 Let’s ban bump stocks so at least that one form of massacring people won’t be available.
2638 2018-06-07 03:20:22 I wish all guns but hunting rifles were banned. Bump stocks should never have been invented.
2639 2018-06-07 03:20:14 And if it wasn’t for the deal, they would already have large stocks of bomb-grade material. They gave that all up. We threw away inspections, we threw away enforcement, and we got nothing. We got nothing. Great deal.

2641 2018-06-07 03:18:21 I assumed this would happen months ago when they pretty much said this would happen, and let’s not forget the what was it?8-12 weeks AFTER house& senate AGREE before can take effect....we are looking at next year, Bros. Ping-pong, sell yer Lpee stocks Bros.
2642 2018-06-07 03:17:47 We should absolutely ban bump stocks! They have no legitimate purpose for civilians. #BanBumpStocks

2644 2018-06-07 03:17:43 Not only that, but the shooting that brought attention to bump stocks, occurred in a state where fully automatic weapons are legal. He didn’t need a bump stock to pull it off; he could’ve just purchased full auto.
2645 2018-06-07 03:17:41 The only thing  bump stocks are good for is to increase body count. #BanBumpStocks

2649 2018-06-07 03:15:38 Absolutely no good use for bump stocks. Ban them.
2650 2018-06-07 03:15:18 Why all of a sudden there are nice movements in the stocks again?
2651 2018-06-07 03:15:01 Ban bump stocks. No brainer.
2652 2018-06-07 03:14:29 So here's the thing. While you think your insults matter one iota .. anyone with a conscious gets that this is about stopping violence.  If you don't think bump stocks will help, then come up with your own god damn plan, until then shut up and get out of the way of the grown ups.
2653 2018-06-07 03:11:45 there is no 1 else who wants to sell seee in morning today at 9 am as the sell order get lined up the number of sellers are may be 20 to 50 snd stocks are in lacs  means few people selling huge quantity
2654 2018-06-07 03:11:21 Unbelievable that this is even an issue.  For god’s sake, ban bump stocks.

2657 2018-06-07 03:10:26 Lobbying works both ways. Not a chance he sincerely cares about this without him owning hisself some Aluminum stocks.
2658 2018-06-07 03:09:32 Submit your comment to ban bump stocks- I urge ATF to finalize its proposed rule clarifying that bump fire stocks, along with other “conversion devices” that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as “machineguns” under the National Firearms Act.

2663 2018-06-07 03:07:19 Laughing because I have a few stocks sitting at minus 50% of my original investment. Woes me and the bags.
2664 2018-06-07 03:07:07 Ban bump stocks!
2665 2018-06-07 03:05:50 That's stupid. If you want to stop something you're much better off with a shotgun. Much less need for accuracy.

Unless of course you have a bump stock. That'd work.

So y'all need bump stocks too.
2666 2018-06-07 03:05:06 Ban bump stocks!

2696 2018-06-07 02:57:26 Ban bump stocks. Save lives.
2697 2018-06-07 02:57:20 bump stocks should be banned by federal law. We will vote you out. The American ppl say Not One More.
2698 2018-06-07 02:57:11 And then all those cheap stocks, repo real estate and loans to be sold by the upper crust!!!
2699 2018-06-07 02:56:31 We need to ban bump stocks and have more gun control laws! I am a high school teacher and I can’t believe that owning guns is more important than human lives.

2701 2018-06-07 02:55:56 not looking good, all DRC stocks getting hurt
2702 2018-06-07 02:55:52 This year resembles 1993 - 1994 when rates hit a low in 1993 (~3%) and then in the first quarter of 1994 Greenspan started to raise rates. That created a correction that lasted the whole year. But by the start of 1995 stocks were making new highs.
2703 2018-06-07 02:55:37 先日のリミポ利確で保有株は含み損に戻ってたけど、ラサ工爆上げとコムシード630円追加のお陰でまた含み益に戻った。コムシードはもう少し買いたかったが、チキンだった。。。
2704 2018-06-07 02:55:29 Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines while you're at it
2705 2018-06-07 02:55:18 Buy stocks!!!
2706 2018-06-07 02:55:05 I agree bump stocks are unnecessary, but banning the guns they fit is completely ludicrous.
2707 2018-06-07 02:55:01 Bump stocks need to be banned!!! How many have to die?
2708 2018-06-07 02:54:41 The Walmart on Bovaird and Main is a joke. The store is absolute chaos. I’ve been there on multiple occasions, at different times. Zero stocks, rotting produce.
2709 2018-06-07 02:54:35 I just stumbled upon this when trying to eliminate stocks. Now i keep checking stock price performance from all previous highs - 2010 Nov, 2015 march, and now 2018 Jan.
2710 2018-06-07 02:53:52 Let’s just correct this, shall we? These are for OPEN CARRY permits only. In most states, you can buy semi automatics without going through most of this and until recently (oct 2017), you could buy bump stocks
2711 2018-06-07 02:53:52 Bump stocks are not weapons of war, nor ar AR15’s. They’re civilian models of weapons. They are not and never will be suitable for frontline combat. I agree bump stocks are not necessary, but they are also not used in the military.
2712 2018-06-07 02:53:43 Yeah but you're only ever a stock behind. And he can take stocks.

I think we're off the original point you're contesting though. You're right that disjoints don't lose to rushdown, but they can suffer against projectiles given they often don't have their own projectiles.
2713 2018-06-07 02:53:13 Ban bump stocks and the guns they fit. Only good for war and massive deaths.

2716 2018-06-07 02:52:53 4's punish game is actually too good, but inconsistent and combined with a slow neutral that prevents more stocks. It's not in the same way as Melee though. With rage, many characters can reliably 0-death or kill at like 60. Plus, advantage states are incredibly strong

2727 2018-06-07 02:49:37 Do it yourself account? U need FRIP taken from Scottrade clients.

2729 2018-06-07 02:49:09 That doesn’t negate my point. Fox has higher gravity and weight than sheik but easily gimped and is combo food for the top 5. Fox is a fantastic character but let’s not act like losing first stick early isn’t a major inconvenience in S4 when we only have 2 stocks

2829 2018-06-07 02:17:26 I not only support the banning of bump stocks, but the banning of all assault weapons, as well as conceal-and-carry laws. The Second Amendment was not intended as a catch-all for everything, but for a well-regulated militia.

2843 2018-06-07 02:13:03 Certainly bump stocks need to be banned. Can anyone name one reasonable purpose for their existence in the first place other than killing people? Who, besides a criminal, would be so afraid of someone out to get him that he needed a rapid-fire assault weapon?

2891 2018-06-07 01:56:06 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2892 2018-06-07 01:55:28 Based on experience mas maliit na risk yung business kesa stocks, pero kung stocks gusto mo okay ang mutual funds. Sa business kasi sa atin sa Pinas medyo volatile at unpredictable ang market.

2918 2018-06-07 01:47:24 Bump stocks should be banned
2919 2018-06-07 01:47:20 Suhooooo~~ wannnntttt~ 
2920 2018-06-07 01:46:48 Should be interesting to watch tomorrow. Will people take their profits and cut the shorts some slack, or will they keep them in the vise and turn the screw?
I've always loved watching stocks, even though I'm not an investor, and Tesla's volatility is like nothing I've ever seen.
2921 2018-06-07 01:46:38 I want to ban bump stocks. Thank you David, et al #BanBumpStocks
2922 2018-06-07 01:46:33 Just buy stocks. I pointed out earlier that I am about 1% smarter today than yesterday. That's how my portfolio did.

2927 2018-06-07 01:44:49 No guns period! Especially no bump stocks!
2928 2018-06-07 01:44:25 Well remember, when it was announced, Nintendo's stocks skyrocketed for a bit so I the gradual slide back down prolly doesn't have to do with Pokemon imo. Guaranteed tho, once we hear more of Pokemon Pik & Eve later in the year, stock will swing upwards again.
2929 2018-06-07 01:44:06 Get rid of bump stocks!
2930 2018-06-07 01:43:59 You mean how many companies got a bigly tax break and used it to buy back their own stocks.
It did not go to workers.
Where is your credible source for Obama not increasing the economy?

2933 2018-06-07 01:43:14 No one needs bump stocks!
2934 2018-06-07 01:42:44  if you paid attention to the market and those all knowing it’s not just the WB making warnings. Stocks are massively overinflated and Wall Street has issued warnings twice now of an impending crash if these policies move forward that will make 2008 look like a hiccup
2935 2018-06-07 01:42:06 Ban bump stocks.
2936 2018-06-07 01:41:13 We are SO excited to announce our Polo Ralph Lauren store now stocks kids clothing. Happy Shopping  @ Harbour Town Adelaide
2937 2018-06-07 01:40:57 $SPY Problem with popular stocks and pretty charts is many get too excited much higher instead of lower, during the (better) setup process.
2938 2018-06-07 01:40:54 There is no reason for Bump Stocks other than mass murder!  Shut them down!
2939 2018-06-07 01:40:29 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2940 2018-06-07 01:39:57 Ban bump stocks now.
2941 2018-06-07 01:39:40 Banning Bump Stocks is long over due....
2942 2018-06-07 01:39:20 Cash, low leverage value stocks (EV/EBIT), metals, mining, and Ag, FANG puts, and most importantly cash.
2943 2018-06-07 01:39:08 @Tesla stocks goes up... Tesla stock goes down.  just wait.
2944 2018-06-07 01:38:19 Ah because these stocks are monsters. What would be more weird is if few people owned them
2945 2018-06-07 01:38:14 Bump stocks cheat by modifying weaponry beyond their legal purpose. They have no place in civilian society.
2946 2018-06-07 01:38:02 Banning bump stocks is the LEAST we can do...aside from the status quo of nothing.
2947 2018-06-07 01:37:40 Ban bump stocks
2948 2018-06-07 01:37:25 Ban bump stocks!!!
2949 2018-06-07 01:37:10 That u have to do manually or use price charts from moneycontrol. 

Investing is a process of elimination. So filter OUT 99% using very high barriers. Price may not be the best. Many other barriers u can use - RoE, Profit growth, sales growth, low PE, etc. to get few gr8 stocks
2950 2018-06-07 01:37:03 Ban Bump Stocks.
2951 2018-06-07 01:36:58 Ban bump stocks!
2952 2018-06-07 01:36:49 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2953 2018-06-07 01:36:17 Great. Because most corporations have responded as expected; buying back stocks and paying shareholders, with no money going to workers. Have you heard about Harley Davidson doing just that and then laying off workers and sending work to Thailand?

Kung dati mga minahan ang pinapayaman, ngayon naman, ang kakikasan. So, nangyari ang Japan months

2990 2018-06-07 01:21:21 Actually, it would. For us, maybe it's not very interesting. But for investors, it was showing that Nintendo was expanding beyond just video games and playing cards, thereby making them more money because it makes Nintendo's stocks more valuable.
2991 2018-06-07 01:20:04 Bump stocks are a waste of bullets.

3053 2018-06-07 00:57:04 Bump stocks are an accessory of murder turning another tool of murder, semi-automatic assault rifles, into an automatic weapon, allowing unstable, violent people the ability to shoot 5 -10 x the number of rounds at targeted innocents, each second.

3084 2018-06-07 00:47:06 Yes. Pro-gun guys repeat the NRA lie that bump stocks make the aiming of the gun so bad that it won’t hit anything. Stephen Paddock proved them wrong, but facts appear overrated I guess.
3085 2018-06-07 00:46:56 Prasun ji app ka dastak  achha master stocks bahut achha he hum ta 2 mahina apku dhundte rahe gae
3086 2018-06-07 00:46:12 Bump stocks are shit. Bump firing makes you terribly inaccurate, and you're better off just using semi auto fire anyway.
3087 2018-06-07 00:45:59 Ban bump stocks!
3088 2018-06-07 00:45:16 Dami ko stocks ng gpp chip!!! Mygoood
3089 2018-06-07 00:45:06 When, sick u go to the doctor. Most of the time the doc will do simple analysis like check temp, feel glands, etc.  rarely will they order a cat scan or something deeper.  Looking at stocks is same.  Keep it simple. Is is about supply and demand for equities. Tune out the noise

3091 2018-06-07 00:44:51 We can ban bump stocks.
3092 2018-06-07 00:44:23 Stocks are high, and corn fell off a cliff. World of Ethanol.

3096 2018-06-07 00:42:46 I prefer a collapsible stock on my AR-15. Bump stocks are garbage.
3097 2018-06-07 00:42:37 Keep going! No bump stocks!!
3098 2018-06-07 00:41:58 Economy might be strong, but what has trickled down to the middle and lower class? Wages stagnant for yrs, the promised cheaper and better healthcare not achieved, folks w/o stocks don't gain if the market increases. The rising tide did NOT float all boats; only the wealthy ones.
3099 2018-06-07 00:41:44 How can any decent person support bump stocks? Shame on America. #BanBumpStocks and Assault Rifles.
3100 2018-06-07 00:41:40 Ban these bump stocks forever

3106 2018-06-07 00:40:58 Bump stocks=mass murder
3107 2018-06-07 00:40:42 Stocks carry a value that you don’t necessarily have to sell to experience it. Look at all the billionaires in the world, they mostly own the value of stocks, not their monetary value.
3108 2018-06-07 00:40:40 Today one of the weirdest phenomenons happened to me around 3:00 to 3:30

Overall mindset to this point was very satisfied with the day, great stocks, great gains and a great workout. 

Came back from lunch and legitamilty got hypontized by the market. I fell in a complete trance
3109 2018-06-07 00:40:22 Why is there a question....BAN BUMP STOCKS!!
3110 2018-06-07 00:40:17 Ban bump stocks. Tighten gun laws.
3111 2018-06-07 00:39:49 whoever stocks this machine is a nerd
3112 2018-06-07 00:39:48 Still no mock draft so them draft stocks don’t mean nothin
3113 2018-06-07 00:39:40 Bump stocks are unnecessary and dangerous.  Ban them.
3114 2018-06-07 00:39:22 I do this to my goddaughter and nieces!!! Everytime they act up... Without the stocks though!! Lmao...

3118 2018-06-07 00:38:37 Bump stocks have no place in a society where stupidity is the TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL MANTRA
3119 2018-06-07 00:38:21 Stop being irrational, America. We can have the freedom to own guns while passing common sense laws so our kids can go to school in safety. A ban on bump stocks and assault weapons is the adult thing to do.
3120 2018-06-07 00:38:18 Probably so is buying oil company stocks, I would guess.
3121 2018-06-07 00:37:48 Ban bump stocks!
3122 2018-06-07 00:37:31 Machine guns were outlawed in the 1930’s for a reason. We must ban bump stocks for the same, common sense reason. #LivesOverProfits

3124 2018-06-07 00:36:47 Ban Bump Stocks!
3125 2018-06-07 00:36:44 Why should we ban bump stocks? If anything, they make your shooting less accurate and more difficult to control. Besides, you can easily bump fire with a rubber band.
3126 2018-06-07 00:36:39 We can ban bump stocks!
3127 2018-06-07 00:36:34 Please ban bump stocks!!
3128 2018-06-07 00:36:22 Ban bump stocks. Now someone argue against me (hoping those count too).
3129 2018-06-07 00:35:23 y’all players need to listen to your preseason coaches... draft stocks going down so quick...
3130 2018-06-07 00:35:04 You don't know how guns work, the military mostly use semi-automatic or burst fire modes over fully automatic because it becomes extremely hard to aim. Not only that bump stocks can be replaced by rubber bands.
3131 2018-06-07 00:34:45 Ban bump stocks!
3132 2018-06-07 00:34:42 When are you going to ban bump stocks and raise the gun purchase age to 21 like you said you would? @davidhogg111
3133 2018-06-07 00:34:27 $SPY move here reminds me of Jan. OpEx with mega bull net Deltas for June, Gamma effect set to kick in, MM's will keep having to buy stocks to offset short calls

3142 2018-06-07 00:32:19 The Euro surged and European bonds sold off. However stocks on the continent and in the US rose, and copper continued its recent rally, indicating belief that the economic drivers of higher interest rates were sufficiently strong to sustain asset prices @MicMcCarthy_CMC
3143 2018-06-07 00:32:02 Ban Bump Stocks, large capacity magazines, silencers, and all semi & fully automatic weapons NOW !!
3144 2018-06-07 00:31:34 I support banning bump stocks.

3146 2018-06-07 00:30:57 A recession prompted by financial shock could see a large monetary easing with potential for a return to zero or even negative rates–and a possible reboot of QE - Blackrock

This, without a doubt will happen again...

3169 2018-06-07 00:25:07 Excellent advice given the uncertainty of having an illegitimate nitwit in office. Stocks are going to drop severely anytime between now, & the trump end.
3170 2018-06-07 00:23:29 Ban bump stocks!

3173 2018-06-07 00:22:39 It’s not, so far it’s just first party shit which I know you don’t really care for like the Mario’s and Zelda. But I’d still wait, stocks keep dropping so something is up with Nintendo and investors... they know something we don’t.
3174 2018-06-07 00:22:22 Ban the bump stocks!
3175 2018-06-07 00:22:01 Seems like a smart thing to ban bump stocks to me, and yes, i know you can 3d print them, but anything to do to make it more difficult!.
3176 2018-06-07 00:21:53 $SPY It's easy for anyone to post charts of stocks that have already gone up very high! Avoid the temptation & wait. Be selective.
3177 2018-06-07 00:21:40 Let’s ban bump stocks as the first step !
3178 2018-06-07 00:21:26 Agreed ban bump stocks

3190 2018-06-07 00:18:19 Automatic weapons are illegal for a reason, bump stocks only purpose is to allow people to circumvent the law.

Ban Bumpstocks please. Do it for the generations of school children to come, do it for the children that have had to endure such horrific tragedies.

3200 2018-06-07 00:15:03 Hello, glad you asked! We would like to see locked entries, lockdown systems, cameras, etc. Also, school districts can form safety partnerships w/ police. 

Legislatively, expand/ modernize background checks; promote safe storage; ban bump stocks, rate of fire and capacity; etc.
3201 2018-06-07 00:14:36 I thought that banning bump stocks was a no brainer!

3212 2018-06-07 00:11:01 @shannonrwatts I went to a @MomsDemand event in Portland and a couple walking by asked me what I hoped to achieve. I told them I am OK with people owning guns but I want tighter restrictions. No assault rifles, no bump stocks, stronger background checks.
3213 2018-06-07 00:10:57 Why do we need bump stocks? Except to increase the number of children murdered.
3214 2018-06-07 00:10:56 They said there's no money for healthcare insurance expansion to save lives of the sick old and poor but then gave the richest few & biggest richest corporations over a trillion and a half tax dollars & used them buy back stocks & increase corporate bonuses.

3216 2018-06-07 00:09:54 Banning bump stocks is:
- a no-brainer;
- the least we can do;
- just the beginning;
- long overdue;
- the first step in a long journey;
- something no sane person should oppose;
- not a violation of the Second Amendment;
- an acknowledgment that mass shootings are a problem.
