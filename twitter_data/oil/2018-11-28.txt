13 2018-11-28 23:58:59 The moron writer actually infers that there’s no exposure to the price differential because the oil doesn’t make it to major international markets. No kidding! That’s the problem with no access to non US markets. RIP Journalism.

41 2018-11-28 23:58:21 Two points, China needs our trade more than we needs theirs. Grain and oil have a world market. What is taken out of the barrel one place is filled another. The counties denied Argentina's grain because of China, will buy American.
42 2018-11-28 23:58:18 You do realize that all those moving parts will still need oil...
Don't you?

47 2018-11-28 23:57:51 Fried and fuckin infuriating how it takes folk to spread the word on social media to no buy products with palm oil in it cause it’s fuckin orangutans n other animals silly, how can the governments and companies involved no just say enough is enough n stop using it...

50 2018-11-28 23:57:27 He's not going to get re-elected because he's already put most drillers under tremendous stress. Who in the world wants him controlling oil revenue in 2020?
51 2018-11-28 23:57:27 Demand has peaked. Electric cars becoming more common and plastics now the new boggie man.

Even the most optimistic oil industry forecasters are predicting a decline in demand over next decade
52 2018-11-28 23:57:27 Sooo Tamia said what's that canola oil they be using at church to put on people foreheads...... I swear she's the dumbest

57 2018-11-28 23:56:53 What did Obama do to make the stock market go up, & what did Obama do to make our oil supply go up? somebody tell me please.
58 2018-11-28 23:56:51 So super important you use a good nonstick or well seasoned steel pan, get the pan hot before adding oil and dumplings, once they color add liquid and cover tightly. Take lid off when 80-90% of water has steamed off. Reduce heat let rest of liquid (flour and water) form crust
59 2018-11-28 23:56:49 Don’t forget he directed his Dept of energy to stop fracking which is the primary reason we are number 1 in oil production
60 2018-11-28 23:56:47 People are fine with accepting that technology has driven down the cost of many things, yet are reluctant to believe that oil is now on that list despite all the evidence saying otherwise.
61 2018-11-28 23:56:44 Cause they got us by the balls with oil , its called ass kissing , in bed with them but he sure didnt say great job putting a bag over his head , cutting him to pieces , it would not matter who was POTUS . it is what it is.
62 2018-11-28 23:56:43 I haven't been able to look at pancakes the same ever since I saw that stupid video with the cardboard and the motor oil
63 2018-11-28 23:56:41 His only concern with climate change is, the more people that become aware of it, the more his oil shares/companies will fall. Everyone involved in oil knows it's just a matter of time and they're holding on for dear life.
64 2018-11-28 23:56:17 OBAMA DID THAT, WHEN HE CANCELED THE OIL PIPELINE !
65 2018-11-28 23:56:14 Ally? Really? Define ally. More like: you'll buy our weapons after we make you rich buying your oil while forcing everyone else to buy it, too.
And repaid with 9-11. This is a disgusting, parasitic relationship that causes untold suffering in the world.
66 2018-11-28 23:55:56 Well said Murray. As the proud husband of an Oshawa GM worker, I can say that all Unifor wants is for GM to live up to the terms of the 2016 collective agreement. And contrary to popular belief, Ontarians have a great deal of sympathy with Alberta's oil patch woes.
67 2018-11-28 23:55:51 Hot baking tips; wanna kick your graham cracker crust up a notch? Half the butter and sub for coconut oil. The taste is out of this world
68 2018-11-28 23:55:42 I'm not opposed to oil per se, just the burning of it for energy. Once it's gone, how will I listen to new records! :-)

AFAIK, using oil as (say) a lubricant doesn't produce greenhouse gasses for example. Burning gasoline derived from oil does.
69 2018-11-28 23:55:35 It's happening, coupled with economic slowdown, oil is down to $60 a barrel And OPEC no plans to cut production, Russia and Venezuela can't afford to cut production so it's only going to get cheaper.
70 2018-11-28 23:55:33 LOL—“When eco-writers attack!”  Clearly all the shipments via rail are done because the oil companies prefer rail over abundant available pipeline space .

74 2018-11-28 23:55:16 The acetone won’t hurt your natural nails at all. They might dry out a bit, but oil/lotion will fix that.

Thankfully Robert Mueller III isn't listening to you, and will continue to uncover the unpatriotic behaviour of your Dear Leader, aka Snake Oil Salesman, D.Trump.

77 2018-11-28 23:55:07 Nothing to do w Obama Pres eased regulations on oil and gas. Finally signed to open Keystone pipe line and started drilling in anwr. This will shift balance of payments in the US favor. #AmericaFirst

79 2018-11-28 23:55:00 Im all for that but what about rhe fact that oil prices are low and at the current prices the oil sands arent very profitable, because that's what first caused the layoffs in the O&G industry a few years back.
80 2018-11-28 23:54:58 @CPC_HQ It is more than Trudeau's policies, it is his destructive and discriminatory ideology.  Trudeau is determined to shut down the resource sector. Like it or not, the future of our country relies on our oil and gas sector, and exporting it to Asia.
81 2018-11-28 23:54:54 Omg tea I have the exact same candle I got it at home goods. Oil perfumery has a tobacco vanille impression that’s supposed to be close for $10 too

94 2018-11-28 23:53:56 I do a mustard oil mask in my hair once a week. It helps a lot with hydration I’ve also been doing braids before bed and putting a little bit of coconut oil on the ends to keep everything good. But even then I’m still having to keep my hair tied up half of the time.

99 2018-11-28 23:53:21 I've been doing a 2hr workout pretty much Aug-Oct'sh. Late October till this weekend schedule hasn't given me the time. Jumped right back into 2hrs this weekend & my right knee was in major pain. Went to my Monk, he gave me this Monk mojo oil. The pain is gone in 1 application!

103 2018-11-28 23:53:01 I thought progressives were against oil??
104 2018-11-28 23:52:56 thanks I'll do this next time. I'm trying to force myself to use it more as I think that's part of the secret. when you say "cover" though, do you put the pan with the oil still on, or do you let it evaporate on the hob first?
105 2018-11-28 23:52:55 Ok yes the food pics it’s shaving cream, motor oil, etc. We all have twitter we all saw the video we get it you don’t have to constantly tweet every single pic with “it’s shaving cream”
106 2018-11-28 23:52:55 I like how he straight up admits it was for oil lmao
107 2018-11-28 23:52:39 So, one of my doctors put me on a Keto diet. It wrecked me. My cholesterol went sky high. I have had soooo many digestive issues. Folks; coconut oil is NOT good for you. Throwing your body into a state of ketoacidosis is NOT good for you. You are damaging yourself. On to the next
108 2018-11-28 23:52:29 Your view on oil prices is backwards, Canadian producers have to sell there oil cheaper because it cost more for us to get it to market. Meaning company’s are losing money on every barrel of oil that is produce in Alberta compared to the US
109 2018-11-28 23:52:12 This oil change is taking too long and my phone is dying

113 2018-11-28 23:51:45 why does a set of oil point cost like $80 and up.....like whyyyyy
114 2018-11-28 23:51:43 Righto then - by your argument the forest would be most productive economically to the locals if it’s felled for timber than replaced with palm oil. That’s exactly what’s happened. Great conservation! If conservation is not the first priority every ecosystem has no future.
115 2018-11-28 23:51:42 You can’t be serious when you say that the federal government bought *Alberta* a pipeline. The oil and gas sector provides economic benefits to all Canadians, representing roughly 7% of GDP. The federal government bought Canadians a pipeline.
116 2018-11-28 23:51:41 Scotland should be leading the world as an innovative low carbon economy. The oil isn't going to run out anytime soon. Nevertheless, drastic action is needed on climate change and fossil fuels need to be abandoned to ensure humanity's survival.
117 2018-11-28 23:51:27 Special interest now runs our country, we are considered a joke by all of the other oil producing nations and they are laughing all the way to the bank.

126 2018-11-28 23:51:11 Really everyone.  You think in 1 year that Canadians will only be buying electric cars in an environment of cheap oil?  Does this make sense?  Nobody will be buying gm anything if they close these plants.

140 2018-11-28 23:49:28 5. Wait for the oil to begin to smoke a little, then take off heat. 
6. Ready to go for next time!
141 2018-11-28 23:49:26 ‘Skint’ comes from the abuses of Cressingham, English Treasurer in Scotland at the time of Wallace’s rising. He had diddled the English Crown and the Scots over taxation and the wool crop. The North Sea oil of its day. He was literally skinned after Stirling brig. Watch,Hammond

We need pipelines ASAP

147 2018-11-28 23:48:51 They are fun to season up. Our cleaning routine is usually
1. Clean with water only (critical)
2. Stuff that can't be sponged gets plastic scrubbered
3. Once stuck on stuff is gone, put cast iron on heat to evaporate water
4. Cover in thin layer of high smoke point oil
148 2018-11-28 23:48:49 Can we just say "oil Cartel" ??
149 2018-11-28 23:48:42 I brought back the oil and gas industry! I drive a lot.
150 2018-11-28 23:48:38 Nothing better than crashing all oil prices regardless of grade, and creating an even worse heavy supply deficit moving forward.

157 2018-11-28 23:47:56 Get some essential oil pepper mint and do like 2-3 drops of oil on your sweatshirt. Makes a world of difference! Feel better brother!
158 2018-11-28 23:47:54 Wow . I don’t know if I should laugh or be pissed!! In what alternative universe does he live in!! He had no more to do with the economy growing and oil production going up than I did!! 
159 2018-11-28 23:47:49 I can make food taste amazing but my plating is garbage. This is like taking the pill to wake up and see the Matrix for what it is. Clearly I just need more cardboard and motor oil!
160 2018-11-28 23:47:42 My dad worked for an oil company and at every recession worried he would be laid off. He only went to high school. We were always told to have no expectations for college or travel because they may not happen. No wonder I got into heading for tenure!
161 2018-11-28 23:47:40 The oil is not the be all and end all we can achieve iscot without it, but we don't have to. You really think we just a poor wee country  #DissolveTheUnion #indyref2
162 2018-11-28 23:47:34 So, no better price, but more of it for sale.  We don't have the carbon budget for an expansion of the oil industry.
163 2018-11-28 23:47:28 This is convenient since he sold out America for big oil  .
164 2018-11-28 23:47:26 I still believe Obama was behind The Chesapeake Oil Co. CEO who supposedly drove his SUV into a concrete bridge abuttment committing suicide. Obama was trying to strong arm him as he did anyone who opposed him. Evidently Obama wasnt winning. This death needs 2B reopened.
165 2018-11-28 23:47:04 Omg not everything is motor oil  never snapchatting on a food shoot again. Y’all are annoying
166 2018-11-28 23:47:02 Oil pulling is hard work
167 2018-11-28 23:47:00 No worries because Canada isn't a player in the world markets. We just import lots of oil at cost.

The area at stake is the so-called ‘transfer of rights’ area, where Petrobras holds 100 percent of the rights to produce 5 billion barrels of oil...zh
170 2018-11-28 23:46:51 No Mr. O, that was not you. You did not really walk on water and you did not usher in the new age of America as the number one oil producer.
171 2018-11-28 23:46:50 Unreal. All this oil production was on state and private lands which Obama tried to block.
172 2018-11-28 23:46:43 ah, this snake oil again
173 2018-11-28 23:46:42 Obama added more oil regulation than anyone. While Trump is dismantling those regs. Yet he makes this claim! I’ll thank you when you and the Clintons JUST GO AWAY!!
174 2018-11-28 23:46:42 Eastern Canada can burn that blood soaked SA shit. We will export our excess oil to the world. Enjoy. 

*PS. Canadian federation is broken.
175 2018-11-28 23:46:36 They wouldn't target cars, American cars already don't sell overseas. They would target agricultural goods, oil, and automotive parts (motors, tires, etc.) All of this hits primarily at conservative heavy states and swing states.
176 2018-11-28 23:46:34 That’s exactly how salons remove fake nails. The acetone will dry your skin, so rub olive oil on your cuticles before you put the acetone on. Leave it on for about 10min.

The fake nail will be ruined, though. If it’s stuck that hard, there’s no other way to take it off.

180 2018-11-28 23:46:25 I have no other. But you didn't answer why Trudeau is a problem. What would you like to see happen that he could actually control. It's certainly not the price of oil. Heading to Boyle for a wedding in the spring.

184 2018-11-28 23:46:01 Yes and we too have some oil/gas/coal tycoons left in this country who won’t go down without a fight. I fear it’s more through politics and with sabatoge and propaganda though.

188 2018-11-28 23:45:34 I’m still using coconut oil and vitamin e. I haven’t tried vitamin a/retinol but it supposedly helps and also good for dark circles around eyes. I’ve used bio oil but got tired of applying it like 3 times a day. Tbh I used them at the same time Bc im neurotic

194 2018-11-28 23:44:46 Because of him, Oklahoma has tremors that may be caused by the fracking. If he hadn't caused oil companies to shut down, fracking wouldn't have been implemented. Ergo, no earthquakes in Oklahoma.

198 2018-11-28 23:44:25 How can a man be as arrogant and ignorant as he is at the same time? He did everything to stop oil drilling off the shores of America. He did everything to close the coal mines and the pipeline. Such a pathetic clown
199 2018-11-28 23:44:23 Who cares about the carbs, don’t eat it at all because it has hydrogenated oil... that’s toxic
200 2018-11-28 23:44:20 Pietro, he's a snake oil salesman... These gas prices have nothing to do with #CarbonNation. That cost was 4.6 cents per litre

202 2018-11-28 23:44:17 @POTUS44 you made a claim you were responsible for America's increase in oil during your administration. You were involved alright, by opposing future oil development and pushing your values for electric cars and cutting back on fossil fuels. You're just a boastful liar!

207 2018-11-28 23:43:51 I love the way now that Obama is out of office everything regarding the economy and the drop in oil prices is because of what he did. Who the F is he kidding.... He’s got some balls. Didn’t do jack s$&t for eight years & single handedly turned race relations back 50 years!

214 2018-11-28 23:43:30 The Keystone pipeline had nothing to do with US oil production. It was designed to take Canadian oil and ship it overseas. The US was not to get more than a trickle of it. The people building it admitted that it would create less than 50 permanent jobs.

Who's delusional now?

219 2018-11-28 23:43:03 America is the largest oil producer because of the hard work of roughnecks and technology. We’re drilling wells faster and deeper than ever before. No president can take credit for this. Keep us free of regulations and turn us loose

224 2018-11-28 23:42:46 Current acct deficits after oil price declined.  Interesting ones were Russia, Ecuador & Venezuela running out of USD's w/Current acct surpluses when oil was still $95 in 3q14.  Was big clue that they had started selling oil in non-USD.
225 2018-11-28 23:42:44 With China and Russia having huge financial interests in Venezuela; the Colombian guerrilla operating in their territory, and the consequences of the declining oil revenue, the mass exodus of Venezuelans will be the least of the region’s problems.
226 2018-11-28 23:42:43 with hindsight, thatcher was a total buffoon who just had ns oil revenue sloshing in at the right time..... 
we should ask @NicolaSturgeon to stop confusing us with the Georgian upper classes ....
227 2018-11-28 23:42:35 @BarackObama . your concept of what you did as president is much different than what I lived through.
It must be some democrats thingy or something.
You didn't make American oil and gas happen.
You were the regulating QUEEN, and solar bankruptcy shouldn't be talked about, right?
228 2018-11-28 23:42:34 Their job is to win the case for the oil company even if they have to make arguments that they personally are completely against. They don't now hate the environment just because they did their job, because that training is needed for them to work on the cases they do want later.

230 2018-11-28 23:42:28 Shavers promised a return. We are talking about self trading commodities. My question is rather simple: If someone in the middle east buys and sells oil to themselves, can they be prosecuted under US law? Is there ever a single case?

233 2018-11-28 23:42:22 Looks like with oil crashing the Q1/19 CPI will drop along with US growth (fiscal policy stimulus via tax cuts waring off). 

My algo still shows ugly GDP coming up & lower yields with it. 

After hearing Powell today I think Fed’s done hiking - maybe 1 more. But going down.
234 2018-11-28 23:42:18 No, he fought hard against oil production on federal land (national parks, wildlife reserves).  Isn’t it better for the private sector and landowners if they own the land themselves?  No permits.
235 2018-11-28 23:42:16 Lol hey girlll ! & yea she horrible. But i have really oil skin as well not really much my face but my nose is a whole different story  , what setting powder you use?

242 2018-11-28 23:40:41 Oil production and stocks went higher DESPITE his actions. Stock market went up due to ZIRP, QE and other stimulus. Cheap money & heavy debt loads will have devastating consequences long term - well after barry is out of office so he can take the credit & none of the blame.
243 2018-11-28 23:40:30 Your job on a case is to win the case, as long as you aren't breaking ethical rules or the law, then I don't associate legal arguments made in a trial with the attorney or firm's personal views. Many enviro lawyers start out working for oil companies b/c of money and training
244 2018-11-28 23:40:29 I went to an endodontist who used clove oil as a disinfectant. You can get that at a drug store. Try it. But I agree, you need the antibiotics. That doctor also taught me to take probiotics whenever you take antibiotics.  You can get a very cheap one. HTH.
245 2018-11-28 23:40:26 We don’t need their oil anymore. We lean on the Emiratis to lean on KSA. Withdraw from KSA all political support and military sales. Backchannel w Iran to moderate and welcome them back on the world stage. You’ll laugh, but Iran (Ayatollahs aside) are a natural ally of the west.

264 2018-11-28 23:39:20 I still say he shouldn't be given any credit. First he said that American oil production was a pipe dream, then he said it was a waste of money and would only drive up prices, then he said it was a hazard to the environment. He did nothing but make excuses and life harder.

274 2018-11-28 23:38:31 The big oil increase was from fracking.  So now Obama is supporting fracking.... it was industry technology advancement that caused the new oil era in the US.  Democrats are glory hogs— Gore invented the internet and Obama gave us fracking!
275 2018-11-28 23:38:24 Would you rather he spark an oil embargo or start a war? Stupid...
276 2018-11-28 23:38:04 りくｓ　ＧＪ！！！
これでスピさん脱ぐ回数減るかと思うと素晴らしいね‥(*´∇｀*)
277 2018-11-28 23:37:54 Nice bit of palm oil as well. Yum!
278 2018-11-28 23:37:49 What an arrogant, lying ass.  He actually believes his own BS.  This was the president who put all sorts of environmental restrictions in place making US oil exploration difficult.  Did he forget this conveniently?
279 2018-11-28 23:37:28 Obama doing his standup comedy routine.  Even he had to chuckle when he took credit for the oil boom trump has cut loose.
280 2018-11-28 23:37:24 “What do you want for Christmas?”
“A free oil change”
281 2018-11-28 23:37:23 barry the liar tryin to take credit for oil/economy!?!
282 2018-11-28 23:37:20 Yo I love tea tree oil
283 2018-11-28 23:37:20 Car ATL ready. Minus the oil change.
284 2018-11-28 23:37:14 First little o our oil field boom from 2010 to 2015 before you regulated us and shut us down over night  literally. Was the remainder of bushs oil run..and what is this fast and furious scandal i havent heard of that one
285 2018-11-28 23:37:13 #DumbAss @potus44 doesn't realize how laughable he is, or does he ?  Even he laughed at his claim about oil. As with other things, progress was made in spite of @BarackObama, not because of him. @BretBaier #SpecialReport
286 2018-11-28 23:37:09 Especially since oil down to $60 a barrel. There is a glut as people slowly move to electric cars. 2024 most manufacturers move to Electric. Who you going to sell it to.
 And at what price, it's peaked and is on way down as fossel fuels fall out of fashion.
287 2018-11-28 23:37:06 Did you look at the chart?? Ups and downs for centuries (millennia) then a huge spike starting around the 1950s (hmm...). And who has the money to fund a disinformation campaign and the most to lose/gain? Big oil. There’s your conspiracy.
288 2018-11-28 23:37:04 Today I got a beautiful ceramic essential oil diffuser for our living room. I love it SO MUCH! I want another one for Christmas so I can have one in our bedroom. 

Someone tell  my wish!  
289 2018-11-28 23:37:03 Pathological liar... Sad all of the women in the world tried to parade her around like a trophy of success and all she ended up being is a complete joke and snake oil saleswoman.
290 2018-11-28 23:36:58 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.

Who’s running this?
293 2018-11-28 23:36:49 Literally TX and ND dragged the nation into oil surplus.
294 2018-11-28 23:36:43 I am tired of not hearing about oil subsidies that is the US military presence in the Middle East.  We would care about it as much if they didn’t pump 20M/bbls a day.
295 2018-11-28 23:36:41 @Wills_Place Hi Will, I can't DM you bc you are not following me, I think that's why.  Request to add to your next train.  I am a Daughter of a Naval Aviator (retired Cmdr - fighter during Vietnam, recon, test pilot and lead pilot for oil tycoon in TX) He is now fully retired.

297 2018-11-28 23:36:24 Dude just take a closer look, you are like my husband when he's trying to find olive oil in the pantry
298 2018-11-28 23:36:24 As I recall,  President Obama was not a fan of the oil and gas industry. Frankly, I believe this brilliant speaker is spinning the Democrat socialist agenda to appear more moderate. He is setting his party up for 2020.
299 2018-11-28 23:36:21 Who has oil pens?
300 2018-11-28 23:36:14 Senator usually i agree with you.  However you politicians have screwed America making us weak.  Debt and oil dependence and many other things.  Now you have very little to bargain with to demand a civilized societies.   We owe everyone thanks to all of you!
301 2018-11-28 23:36:06 i want to buy the turmeric cleansing oil from olivia care but shipping is 8 DOLLARS
302 2018-11-28 23:35:58 The quotas were set in 2016 and everyone knows them already. They would just be rolling back to those levels so nothing really to dispute on their end. They should have never produced more for Trump. Trump lied. USA never needed that extra oil. Trump went limp on Iran sanctions.
303 2018-11-28 23:35:48 @JohnCornyn Trump Wash Post interview Wants out of Mideast Blames oil Israel for being there Floated idea of removing US troops Oil no longer justifies our presence Reason to stay Israel Its nuclear armed state #10th in world with percapita income nearly equals USA LEAVE  NOW
304 2018-11-28 23:35:47 Obama is having a difficult time dealing with Trumps success.  Sad to see him trying to take credit for oil production when all he did was throw up road blocks.  His big ego just can’t take it.
305 2018-11-28 23:35:41 "Fake news," like the evidence and daily news barrage about WMD in Iraq, that was used to wage the illegal, immoral Iraq war waged against a known to be defenseless country with oh so very much oil under its feet?
306 2018-11-28 23:35:38 $USOIL was down to 50 and oil names were up alot

308 2018-11-28 23:35:37 Obama has as much to do with America's oil production as Hillary has to do with Monica's blowjob.
309 2018-11-28 23:35:16 hot oil treatment  been a while but feels soo gooodd

311 2018-11-28 23:34:46 Blaum Bro’s was a great pour - heavy oil, butter, long finish, and worth snagging a second bottle.  Ezra at 7 years for the price point is a steal.
312 2018-11-28 23:34:23 Umm sikeeeeeee lmaooo he know better get his lil ass beat with some baby oil
313 2018-11-28 23:34:04 I wonder if the Western leaders who organized the Arab pawns to carry out their worldwide terrorist agenda to support their chaos and war diplomacy and economy with oil revenues ever envisioned their targets joining an alliance and squashing them? It could happen...
314 2018-11-28 23:34:03 oh snap - I didn't know it helped with oil production!
315 2018-11-28 23:33:57 Well this fool is from the coal industry. Knows nothing about climate change. He’s not a climatologists. He can attack it all he wants. This all about protecting Oil, Gas, mining  & logging interests.
316 2018-11-28 23:33:55 Let me oil you up
317 2018-11-28 23:33:44 Yass lol I understood! I'm Canto. I usually mix XO sauce, peanut butter, soy, garlic, hoisin, scallions & sesame oil!

319 2018-11-28 23:33:36 I thought oil was the devil to the environmental folks .....
320 2018-11-28 23:33:17 Can u get high off olbas oil
321 2018-11-28 23:33:09 You know you know man made climate change is bullshit.  Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was me people ... say thank you."  He would never claim that if it were true
322 2018-11-28 23:33:06 Shell are greenwashing. Just trying to look like you care so you can carry on extracting oil & gas as long as possible. Disgusting. How can anyone work for this company. Shameful
323 2018-11-28 23:33:00 Mexican MAya which is another heavy oil similar to tar sands trades at a premium to wti.

With Venezuelan production knocked out there is a premium on heavy grades because the shale being produced in the states needs to be blended.
324 2018-11-28 23:32:57 And do you think the England are gonna cut ties with scotland when they've just massively fucked up brexit. What will they have left after the oil money isn't there's to play with?

331 2018-11-28 23:32:37 Yes! I love snake oil! PM me the details.
332 2018-11-28 23:32:33 I still can’t believe, the more I read, that Obama now is taking credit for the rise in oil production. When is that wanna be,but wasn’t, traitor to the USA, going to quit lying? NEVER BECAUSE the Dems are as ignorant as OBAMA’S HANDLERS! He WILL BE REMEMBERED! His Legacy-TRAITOR
333 2018-11-28 23:32:26 Oil is evil, plain and simple. We need to get off our dependence on it!
334 2018-11-28 23:32:25 You ever take your car to get an oil change and they start telling you everything that’s wrong with your car lmao damn I didn’t need to know...over here telling the whole shop 
335 2018-11-28 23:32:23 That’s exactly what the oil workers said with their magic wand
336 2018-11-28 23:32:20 Should I oil my hair ? It’s been yearsss
337 2018-11-28 23:32:18 Oil has bounced 3x off $50. I don't think you're going to see $48. We were at $52.50 earlier today even with high imports showing up on the EIA report. The imports were the only reason for the build. Refineries were processing more.
338 2018-11-28 23:32:15 Obama is truly a slime bag .....he did nothing to help the oil and gas industry, in fact, he weaponized the EPA against it .... he is a liar
339 2018-11-28 23:32:01 ドナたんのその素直なトコロ好きやよ
340 2018-11-28 23:32:00 This from the anti fossil fuel President who is taking credit for the tremendous growth in the oil industry. If that was Trump you would be sounding sirens.

346 2018-11-28 23:31:37 he said he'd get mfg back-he did. He said he'd cut taxes and regulations-he did. He said he'd get GDP back up-he did. He said he'd open the oil pipelines-he did. He said he'd recognize the capital as Jerusalem,move our embassy-he did. that's for starters

351 2018-11-28 23:31:03 Thatcher used oil to prop up her disastrous policies. She also sold the countries assets, for what? What do we have to show for it?
352 2018-11-28 23:30:59 @Thom_Hartmann w/ climate change at the focus of our time today, you sir, propping up Beto for 2020 is disheartening! Beto's top donors before his Senate run were oil&gas companies, Banks and airlines. For everything you talk on your show, you really think this man fits the bill?
353 2018-11-28 23:30:53 Obama is in love with himself, he did NOTHING to assist the oil and gas industry, his lies are legendary...... you can keep your doctor, your premiums will drop,.......
354 2018-11-28 23:30:53 My next step, is to take the mold I had machined for these cups, and use it to make skull oil lanterns.
355 2018-11-28 23:30:43 Yes something will be arranged re the debt WM have got us into thanks to mismanagement of the oil money for the last 40 years.. thankfully there's just been a discovery (in 2014) of 50+ years of oil. Once we take back control it will be managed better.

358 2018-11-28 23:30:35 That stuff is weird and doesn't work well for adding flavorings that don't melt, alas. Sometimes having the pour-over flavor oil helps to make stuff stick.

360 2018-11-28 23:30:18 Sure send all their oil via rail and tanker trucks.  After all the pipeline itself produces more C02 than the gas/diesel used by other forms of transportation?  Have you been smoking too much weed?
361 2018-11-28 23:30:18 Credit where credit is due. That putz dumped 85 goals from the Oil for Larsson, Spooner and Rienhart, but at $2.5m Koskinen is looking like a good bet.

368 2018-11-28 23:29:45 In a world where transportation bottlenecks did not exist then the difference in their prices would relate simply to the distance the oil had to travel to final market, as transportation costs are always factored into sale price.

370 2018-11-28 23:29:32 Obama was opposed to all fossil fuels including oil. He would have liked to reduce production, not increase it.
371 2018-11-28 23:29:30 I've got a question.. Anyone have any ideas on how to get oil based paint off a phone? Or out of silk? Any suggestions? Lol don't ask
372 2018-11-28 23:29:30 President Muhammadu #Buhari wants to diversify #Nigeria’s economy away from #hydrocarbons, and agriculture is one of the sectors he has bet on. The economy of #Africa’s biggest #oil producer is still recovering from a slump in 2016, after the crash in crude prices.
373 2018-11-28 23:29:29 Why are you subsidizing the fossil fuel industry? You should be using that money on renewables. It’s going to be painful but the oil industry as we know it must end, the future of the planet is at stake!

376 2018-11-28 23:29:20 Thanks for the information.  I am interpreting this as there will be no new surface leases granted for oil and gas development within the colored areas of the map?  Am I understanding it correctly?
377 2018-11-28 23:29:17 Lol killing a bug is such a process. Deff up there in difficulty with mounting tv’s and oil changes
378 2018-11-28 23:29:16 Regulation never happens preemptively; it happens because businesses and industries have already failed to act ethically in a free market. Market forces didn't stop Ma Bell, or Standard Oil. Old MacDonald would sell you rotten meat in a heartbeat if he weren't inspected.

381 2018-11-28 23:28:59 Well, my main point wasn’t Obama’s tone or motivation for the remark, but if I’m really thinking about it, it seems like Obama was lightheartedly pointing out that his environmental policies didn’t stifle the oil industry.

It was less a brag, and more a defense of his policies.
382 2018-11-28 23:28:56 SPRUCE: Uh...seems to be having trouble opening the bottle of holy oil at Michael, who explodes in flames.
383 2018-11-28 23:28:56 America is the largest oil producer " that was me people "... say thank you."      R/T ed Robin !!
384 2018-11-28 23:28:51 Americans have their own oil now.  That's why ours is cheap.  They have so damn much oil even they are having trouble transporting it.
385 2018-11-28 23:28:49 This same chairman was caught changing d oil filter of a female student in his office..ASUU and d scul swept it under d carpet b4 d issue of embezzlement.. They are not fighting for the student but fighting for their pocket.

387 2018-11-28 23:28:25 You mean AFTER you shut down drilling in the gulf, and hamstrung gas and oil production in the state, right?
388 2018-11-28 23:28:11 i am sure it helped.. yes... but the target for oil i think is determined already 47.7x-48.6
389 2018-11-28 23:28:08 Wow, didn't his campaign belittle Sarah Palin for drill baby drill and her statements if we drill we will become oil independent?  I hate to say, he didn't build that.
390 2018-11-28 23:27:52 a good olive oil     blossoms in the mouth
391 2018-11-28 23:27:50 Thanks for letting us know. We’ve checked that out and couldn’t see any oil. However, we are deep cleaning that area this evening to avoid any potential slips. Have a great evening. ^JH

sadly, does nothing but reinforce what a bunch of chumps us diehard fans really are... haven’t you seen the giant flag they roll out during the, ahem, national anthem?

404 2018-11-28 23:26:38 The Feds bought an operating pipeline plus the plans for an additional pipeline that doesn’t have a drop of oil flowing through it. Yah, the Feds owe AB big time.
405 2018-11-28 23:26:30 Obama is a lying leftist who did all he could to destroy the oil & mining industries in this country. He’s bitter, arrogant, narcissistic, & a failed President. That’s the Obama legacy. He might as well get used to it.
406 2018-11-28 23:26:30 sana oil
407 2018-11-28 23:26:28 Yeah, with Bush  licences on private land? Obama  and the left were hoping for gradual high oil prices to accelerate shift to renewable energy sources. The high US oil production happened in spite of them.
Can you point to exact policy they enacted to make this happen?
408 2018-11-28 23:26:26 You name it. Crowded FAANG cracked one by one vs inflated expectations, Saudi “please forgive us” oil supply shock, 2019 EPS too high, credit wobbled. Standard multiple-cause gut check.
409 2018-11-28 23:26:25 Oh yes, that coastline is stunning. Easy to understand why any up-and-coming Houston oil executive would fall in love with it.
410 2018-11-28 23:26:23 Really! I know a whole lot of people who are being hurt daily by the oil situation in Alberta. I can tell you straight out, this situation is real and devastating.
411 2018-11-28 23:26:22 Obama was all about green energy and all about shutting down the oil energy, remember coal,
412 2018-11-28 23:26:11 This dufus is an idiot, ignorant beyond reason. Things like climate don't get cleaned up like sweeping a floor or vacuuming a rug. There is no quick fix, or immediate result to an attempted fix. Yet people continue to believe him. Think people, how long taken for oil spills?
413 2018-11-28 23:26:05 Wow, didn't his campaign belittle Sarah Palin for drill baby drill and her statements if we drill we will become oil independent?  I hate to say, he didn't build that.
414 2018-11-28 23:25:50 Good morning!
415 2018-11-28 23:25:42 NatGas spiked and then immediately oil tanked. Don't read too much into it. It's a well known pair trade going wrong. The shortNatGas/longOil guys get burned and forced to get out.
416 2018-11-28 23:25:40 I care about the employment prospects of people who depend on the fossil fuel industry. We need oil and gas for some years to come, but we DO need to "phase out" the tar sands &c as we build capacity for the next generation to have good jobs that won't dry up in their lifetimes.
417 2018-11-28 23:25:38 I did a bit of digging and it seems very Pray Away The Gay. Between that and the therapist releasing a load of weight loss audiobooks, I’m pretty much on the side of them being malicious snake oil merchants
418 2018-11-28 23:25:37 CBD oil made me incredibly angry at approximately 2pm every day it was.... no bueno!
419 2018-11-28 23:25:37 Use canned oil to spread the outside, and use two pieces of cheese
420 2018-11-28 23:25:37 Fact is that the industry itself, takes this cheap oil.  Ships it to facilities south of the border, and makes a killing off of it.  They have no reason to curtail production and every reason to fight it in the courts. Legislation of this kind would be anti competitive in nature.
421 2018-11-28 23:25:33 @JohnLeFevre - the majority of currently produced shale oil is drilled on private property in Texas.  It was a technological advancement (fracking) and field discovery, not government policy, that has allowed America to drastically increase production.  Thanks to engineers!
422 2018-11-28 23:25:30 Obama talks about his support for climate change and then takes credit for increasing oil production????? He is as  2-faced as Hillary Clinton.
423 2018-11-28 23:25:20 So 2 guys were busted in Georgia & part of what they had were 300 oil vape cartridges. Can I get a few before it goes into evidence? 
424 2018-11-28 23:25:18 My car is having trouble deciding whether to prompt me with 

-low fuel 
-change oil soon 
-put on seatbelt
-check engine

Might fuck around and lift the hood
425 2018-11-28 23:25:14 i like them when i’m using charcoal and oil paints because i lean on my canvas a lot when it’s on a table and with oils and charcoals it just smudges too much :// it hurts my back if i’m there for too long but i’ll usually alternate between sitting and standing

428 2018-11-28 23:24:59 Why do you insist on giving this charlatan of a snake oil salesman credence! His idea of Brexit is to enrich himself at the expense of working man! His faux toff act is beyond the pale!
429 2018-11-28 23:24:58 No, it wasn't you Obama. It was the hard working men and woman of the oil fields. You did everything possible to destroy production.. Let Iran off the sanctions letting them under sell everyone with there crude oil, is one example. Not to mention all the regulations you put out
430 2018-11-28 23:24:57 Forget bitumen Thousands of capped Alberta oil wells wait for export. BC approved Chinese Tanker Terminal & Pipeline to Kitamat. must be special Tankers, don’t bother whales & no leak Pipeline 
Alberta Pipelines carry Bitumen Crude Oil 
Liquid Natural Gas but there’s only 2 lines
431 2018-11-28 23:24:53 Huffin' that linseed oil
432 2018-11-28 23:24:37 Smoked one before claiming he is responsible for the oil production in our country.Fake president!
433 2018-11-28 23:24:24 Did you change the oil in your car or something
434 2018-11-28 23:24:22 He took credit for oil production years ago and had 0 to do with it then too
435 2018-11-28 23:24:16 Jamaican castor oil please work, please!!!!
436 2018-11-28 23:24:13 Obama didn't put that oil in the ground... or sea... it was already there.. and does anyone remember the BP incident?
437 2018-11-28 23:24:12 I support this initiative. I also hope you will implement a reduction of oil production in the province until more shipment capacity is available.
438 2018-11-28 23:24:11 There's just nothing like the aroma onions and garlic warming up in olive oil 
439 2018-11-28 23:24:03 6. Rubbing a gold ring on your eye gets rid of a stye. False: A stye  is a small but painful lump that develops from an eyelash follicle or  an eyelid oil gland that becomes clogged from excess oil, debris or  bacteria.17 Mar 2011
440 2018-11-28 23:24:03 I thought this was gonna say oil changes
441 2018-11-28 23:23:48 @cenovus, which started the push for oil production cuts of AB oil is supporting both @RachelNotley ‘s plan for more rail capacity and @jkenney weighing in favour of production cuts.
442 2018-11-28 23:23:32 A little bit of oil..
443 2018-11-28 23:23:25 have you ever tried a matte setting spray by nyx ? even urban decay has an oil control one
444 2018-11-28 23:23:24 If you stop oil sands companies from making the little money that they currently are how will this not cause layoffs?
445 2018-11-28 23:23:08 How do you explain the oil nations?
Saudi Arabia. UAE. Bahrain.
They all agree that Climate Change is here.
What’s the advantage for them?
446 2018-11-28 23:23:02 Can't wait to get this CBD olive oil
447 2018-11-28 23:22:55 Yep, I have a few people close to home that don’t give a toss about environmental issues and the palm oil issue and have the attitude of ‘well I won’t be around to see the devastating effects ‘ Boils my blood 
448 2018-11-28 23:22:43 It’s a fictional drama on oil politics , it focuses on the heir to the worlds largest oil company , the Shadowmaire Industrries based out of Texas and his secret conflict with the second largest company in the world run by the 5th Saudi Arabian Prince
449 2018-11-28 23:22:34 DianeMarie, Maybe you know the answer to this question. What is the current delivery price differential for oil shipped via existing TMX vs oil shipped to USA via Alberta/Sask pipelines? Kind of curious what price tidewater oil commands in today's glut of product.
450 2018-11-28 23:22:33 おはようごさいます。
ありがとうございます
451 2018-11-28 23:22:27 40 years of mismanagement? Way to go to obfuscate the real issues facing Oil and Gas today. Incompetance by 3 and half years of NDP rule has only made matters worse. The NDP were only too happy to jump on the Liberal bandwagon and sell this province out to the leap Manifesto crew
452 2018-11-28 23:22:23 See CBD oil helps my migraines a shit ton and my insomnia. And I already have IBS so yknow what it’s all good.
453 2018-11-28 23:22:20 No you're not going to protect American workers.  You have no intention of doing so.  However you will hand out gold nuggets to the 1% and your buddies in big oil.
454 2018-11-28 23:22:02 I agree we need to adapt to new economic trends but oil so dominates Alberta's economy that it will be incredibly difficult for them to be successful without it.
455 2018-11-28 23:21:59 Oh....as per Barry he was to busy making America great again....#Oil.
456 2018-11-28 23:21:57 Ummmmm, you sir, were never for this country to boom in the gas and oil industry. Please stop!
457 2018-11-28 23:21:55 THIRTY-FIVE MILLION barrels are already in storage in Alberta. We can’t stockpile our oil in tanks forever.

459 2018-11-28 23:21:48 Stupid question: if trump can unilaterally impose duties on steel and aluminium despite treaties and agreements, why can't Canada kill the deal that sells oil to the US at insanely discounted prices? #cdnpoli
460 2018-11-28 23:21:44 Everyones been raging about tea-tree oil and its benefits for years.. I don't see shit yet tf
461 2018-11-28 23:21:38 Never gonna happen. Oil is too important to the American oligarchy.
462 2018-11-28 23:21:36 (CNOOC) Africa Ltd in 2007 offered $50b in what they described as “alternative funding for infrastructural development in Nigeria’, to acquire a large number of oil and gas assets.  

So $50b not $60

see how done?

468 2018-11-28 23:20:44 No you're confusing him with George W. Bush. It was George W. Bush who had stock in oil & caused us to go into an all-out War over it
469 2018-11-28 23:20:38 This man is an absolute ass. If anything, he stopped oil production!  He is the biggest narcissist the US had ever had.
470 2018-11-28 23:20:34 Go back to sleep....she talks as though we just discovered oil last night.
471 2018-11-28 23:20:17 An incensed Darrell Issa tells Ben Carson that white working-class men are sitting on vast reserves of oil. James Caan punches a wall.
472 2018-11-28 23:20:12 What happened to oil production on federal lands during your presidency?  Answer:  they decreased.  Nationwide production increased because of technology INSPITE of the government.
473 2018-11-28 23:20:03 A short sided plea to keep oil profits high.  The industry will adapt and be just fine as world demand booms.  But every other industry benefits from low oil prices.
474 2018-11-28 23:19:51 Skin oil, sweat, bleh. >_<
475 2018-11-28 23:19:50 Oily with an extra side of oil. Tell her I have urban decay all nighter setting spray and their compact setting powder but I still get really oily throughout the day without my blotching papers and I hate that 
476 2018-11-28 23:19:50 @BarackObama and @TheDemocrats have fought against oil & gas exploration for the last 40 years; this is in spite of you.
477 2018-11-28 23:19:34 Easily if you’re buying quality products. Proteins alone you’re looking at like £30/40. I only buy real butter and olive oil. Nothing processed.
478 2018-11-28 23:19:27 As far as we continue to function on the 1999 constitution, there cannot be a One Nigeria. Over dependency on oil will further make politics in Nigeria ethnic.
479 2018-11-28 23:19:22 I mean, how much hate was involved when the person who invented the corndog skewered the wiener with that stick, dipped it in batter and dunked it in boiling oil?
480 2018-11-28 23:19:18 And I personally like my fries with truffle oil and grana pandana cheese. I haven’t eaten legitimate cheese fries since high school.
481 2018-11-28 23:19:18 @jiffylube there was a Great Dane puppy at your store and your technician me $30 off my oil and filter change. Now that’s a full service experience

483 2018-11-28 23:19:16 But I thought Obama fought to close DOWN the oil
484 2018-11-28 23:19:16 Actually, he was opposed to the big oil focusing on environmental.  That’s why the EPA was so big.  Those billion dollar green ventures, wind, solar and co2 failed.

489 2018-11-28 23:18:54 no no no I really do. and if a light comes on I look in my manual and call my dad about it. I even make sure my oil is good 
490 2018-11-28 23:18:51 Could you imagine if all that oil were not in Alberta, but in southern Alaska . None of these problems would be a issue! We need Strong leadership and representatives!!!

493 2018-11-28 23:18:39 Another thing to check is your oil. Make sure it's topped off and in good condition (not burnt or old).
494 2018-11-28 23:18:35 Would this involve oil?

497 2018-11-28 23:18:30 Crazy, never thought it was motor oil and cardboard
498 2018-11-28 23:18:30 Didn’t Barry say “you didn’t build this” to many business owners and entrepreneurs?! NOW HE MADE AMERICA #1 in Oil Production?? LOL ! EMPTY SUIT FULL OF Sh~*%T
499 2018-11-28 23:18:16 Same in Pennsylvania, all but a few oil and gas companies stopped drilling.
500 2018-11-28 23:18:15 This claim regarding oil and his claim of responsibility of soaring economy show you the character of the man who spent 8 years trying to destroy this country.
501 2018-11-28 23:18:14 Name one shared world view that the US has with SA? 

Its 100% economic. It always has been. We didn't even notice SA until Steineke discovered a massive oil reserve in 1938.

503 2018-11-28 23:18:02 I think if he had gotten his way entirely,  the oil biz in Texas would be suffering and states like mine(OK) who largely depend on production would end up looking like Detroit,  only at state level.
504 2018-11-28 23:17:39 Idk why getting an oil change always ups my anxiety BUT HERE WE ARE LMAO

506 2018-11-28 23:17:21 Your lips look smoother than oil.   
507 2018-11-28 23:17:16 The Union Workers need to rebel. Their dues were used to help the Union Leaders destroy the oil industry, slow the timber industry and get rid of jobs in Canada. These Leftist Unions are against any hope of restoring Canada to a working, conservative nation.
508 2018-11-28 23:17:06 Increase in oil production is happening despite him, not because of him.
509 2018-11-28 23:17:04 It’s a viciously competitive market. If you haven’t done it you can’t get it. Anyway is a fairly big industry and it’s starting to bite huge interests (I’m not going into another topic). Oil and gas will probably last, at this size, for another decade. Plastic will be substituted

529 2018-11-28 23:15:24 Then help Alberta. The amount of money we lose because of this government is hurting everybody. Think of it this way there is a giant oil spill in Alberta and we are going to clean it up

536 2018-11-28 23:14:46 Obama is taking credit for the economy, oil boom, jobs, and the stock market.

Ironically, the the only “win” he’s NOT taking credit for is Trump winning the election...which is the only thing for which Barack is directly responsible.
537 2018-11-28 23:14:45 You’re making an assumption this can be easy.

Quitting carbon will be the hardest thing that people have ever done. 

Carbon industries like oil/gas and the livelihoods of people who depend on them will be decimated. 

But sure, poo-poo the people who correctly point this out.

551 2018-11-28 23:13:59 minyak zaitun atau cleansing oil (cleansing oil gue gatau yong bahannya apa)
552 2018-11-28 23:13:50 Who is responsible for ordering this murder?  Proofs would help in aiming at the right person(s).  Also are we all on board to cause crude oil prices to double up and pay $4 a gallon or more if KSA decide to limit production
553 2018-11-28 23:13:47 The low oil price is because we have one customer and no way to get oil to the coast. Trudeau killed how many pipelines?  Anyone who votes for this idiot needs to move to another country
554 2018-11-28 23:13:46 Watching chopped, judges and everyone hate truffle oil, Derrick" why the hell they got it in the kitchen ???" Lol Derrick ain't feeling chopped we're watching starting with season 1 @namjeezy

雑学記
「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから。

OIL！
556 2018-11-28 23:13:14 What about Alberta? They could save the country and help the world if people would accept that oil is not bad it's actually organic
557 2018-11-28 23:13:10 Like me when I went to Autozone and asked for oil and they said nobody here is going to sick your dick!
558 2018-11-28 23:13:09 You want cardboard and motor oil?
559 2018-11-28 23:13:06 Wait. Check me if I am wrong here.  Did he not block the oil pipeline coming down from Canada, was against coal; gave trillions away to busted go green efforts, and said you would need a magic wand because jobs are not coming back to America, but he wants credit?  Hmmm.
560 2018-11-28 23:13:05 All I care about is: get palm oil out of your products
561 2018-11-28 23:13:04 I want to be clear @Alberta_UCP is NOT calling for SUPPLY MANAGEMENT in the Oil industry.  We are calling for the Supply of oil to be MANAGED by enforcing mandatory production cuts, but for the love of white  Jesus(tm) don't call it supply management @MaximeBernier will kill me.
562 2018-11-28 23:12:56 This polluted air can’t be good for us in anyway. Why do we let the oil industry poison us when the technology to have electric cars is already available? @NPR @cnn @VICELAND @thenewsjunkie #cleanair #WeDeserveBetter
563 2018-11-28 23:12:55 When we had to use coconut oil bc we didn’t have vegetable oil <<<<
564 2018-11-28 23:12:49 Di makatulog. 
565 2018-11-28 23:12:41 Yikes! I went through several times. Luckily in my last enlistment they couldn't use CS and used banana oil instead.
My brother said the army got them sweaty first and when the CS gas mixed with the sweat it was pure agony
566 2018-11-28 23:12:38 Who cares...let the arabs keep killing each other, all they know. They are an uncivilized culture, given wealth through oil that they cannot properly manage. It's like a bunch of 5th graders w millions. Let em all die and take the oil.
567 2018-11-28 23:12:36 lol.. i’m ready try this caster oil mixed with orange juice they said that helps too !
568 2018-11-28 23:12:30 Problem is Gerr, Butts and his puppet Trudope want to phase out the oil industry. Incredible idea otherwise.
569 2018-11-28 23:12:26 @walmarthelp got an oil change in simi valley Walmart. I barely get a day off a week to take care of stuff. They put the wrong brand of oil from what I asked for. Now I have to find time to have them change it.
570 2018-11-28 23:12:24 Chicken thigh and kailan baked with cheddar cheese. Serve with a side of ciabatta in olive oil.
571 2018-11-28 23:12:23 On my list of important car things, state inspection was #1 and oil change was #2. 

Guess which one the place I went to wasn't able to do.
572 2018-11-28 23:12:17 @KySportsRadio does that Van also take oil?
573 2018-11-28 23:12:14 If your blood type is O that vegan diet will cause problems over time. Yes unfiltered extra virgin olive oil is cardio protective. Data supports
574 2018-11-28 23:12:05 The cause is a reliance on a commodity whose price you have no control over. Get off fossil fuels and stop sucking off big oil elites.
575 2018-11-28 23:11:51 Obama should actually get the credit for being the top snake oil peddler.
576 2018-11-28 23:11:41 They use motor oil instead on real syrup when they do like commercials and stuff because motor oil doesn’t soak into the pancake
577 2018-11-28 23:11:17 How is it that absolutely every single man i know in this damn city can't mount a damn TV! Ain't that like changing oil or killing a bug? Y'all useless.
578 2018-11-28 23:11:09 I just received a sample of @loccitaneusa shower oil and I am blown away that there is braille on the bottle. EVERY PRODUCT EVER SHOULD HAVE THIS!
579 2018-11-28 23:11:01 まざまざい。
580 2018-11-28 23:11:01 I refuse to be up until 2am, my pillows are smothered in lavander oil and I’ve taken 3 kalms- sleep where u @
581 2018-11-28 23:10:57 Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was *despite* me people ... say thank you."
582 2018-11-28 23:10:51 He has to pencil you in before changing his oil, buying a house, and making a phone call with confidence.
583 2018-11-28 23:10:49 Whats this about pancakes and motor oil?
584 2018-11-28 23:10:42 Potential uses in the oil patch, I'd think... Interested in looking?
585 2018-11-28 23:10:34 My manz get his oil from the source itself, pulled up to Pump & Pray and Abdul got him out the way
586 2018-11-28 23:10:32 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
587 2018-11-28 23:10:27 Only More #WaterPipelines and #SewagePipelines!
You are being very short sighted there #MYALBERTANS!
There is more energy potential in a spoon of water than a barrel of oil!
#RenewableEnergy and #HempGrowth are the keys to #AlbertasSuccess!
#PLUR + #ULUR = #WPPM = +#PLUR
588 2018-11-28 23:10:27 Obama did everything he could to sabotage  the Oil business, he will probably take credit for the wall after it is built.
589 2018-11-28 23:10:26 Pretty obvious when there is an over-supply.  Supply and demand is pretty basic fact of the market.  Had the same #pipeline capacity when oil was $100/barrel.
590 2018-11-28 23:10:26 Yep, just a matter of when another oil train derails.
591 2018-11-28 23:10:23 Oh yes, his policies were so pro oil & natural gas.  Friggen clown.  Is he also going to take credit for Cubs finally winning the series?
592 2018-11-28 23:10:22 Wings in a air fryer ... basically frying without oil
593 2018-11-28 23:10:22 Wow loooooove you also love pasta, olive oil, and garlic. A forever hit!!!
594 2018-11-28 23:10:17 Getting an oil change is the most relieving thing in the world
595 2018-11-28 23:10:17 Wait, I thought oil was evil?

So confused ...
596 2018-11-28 23:10:12 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
597 2018-11-28 23:10:09 @PlantTherapy I followed suggestions for use of tea tree oil today for sinus headaches. I went from crying to feeling normal again! And within an hour. Love your oils!
598 2018-11-28 23:10:08 Snake oil saleman.
599 2018-11-28 23:09:54 Externalities aside, it is ridiculous to say that a lower price on a fundamental input such as oil is anything but a good thing for the country's and the world's economy.
600 2018-11-28 23:09:50 I support our relationship with the Saudis. BUT: Are WE paying THEM military aid funds? With all the oil money they extort out of us, WHY?
601 2018-11-28 23:09:44 Getting your oil change by a great mechanic will either...

A. Give you the motivation have your car in the parking lot at work early 

Or

B. Have you call out and let them tires rest after that tire alignment/rotation
602 2018-11-28 23:09:42 What a total narcissist. The US became the largest producer of oil despite Obama and his policies.
603 2018-11-28 23:09:40 If wind and solar were truly and objectively better, they wouldn't need subsidizing.

You couldn't stop them with the tax penalties and regulatory impediments placed on oil and gas.
604 2018-11-28 23:09:39 The guy blamed oil production/fossil fuel use for his global warming bullshit. If it's true that he's responsible for current production levels, why are enviros not scalping the guy for killing the planet?
605 2018-11-28 23:09:28 ぽきた
606 2018-11-28 23:09:19 Check your facts boy : no oil in Qatar but gas
607 2018-11-28 23:09:16 credit/oil and the dollar.  For now the stock mkt chooses to ignore.

609 2018-11-28 23:09:01 Congrats to the ref on that oil money bribe pay out. Maybe now he can scrape together some bum fluff for a hair transplant. #PSGvLFC
610 2018-11-28 23:08:50 #Obama shut down gulf oil rigs for years but Let Foreign companies continue to drill off the golf of Mexico after the big spill
611 2018-11-28 23:08:46 19%comes from the Middle East. That includes Saudi Arabia. The majority of foreign oil comes from Canada.
612 2018-11-28 23:08:44 誰かがそばにいてくれたらね〜違うんだけどね〜（ただ癒されたいだけ）
613 2018-11-28 23:08:40 Brent oil at its lowest in 14 months yet fuel prices remain sky high, big oil companies making billions more in profits #fuelprices
614 2018-11-28 23:08:33 Looks like you changed the oil or killed someone
615 2018-11-28 23:08:33 What Obama is actually trying to say is .... he is the world largest snake oil producer.
616 2018-11-28 23:08:32 @PnPCBC Watching the show today.. In disbelief that the French issue in Ontario seems to be a bigger story than auto industry & oil and gas disappearing... the priorities in this Country are out of touch with reality
617 2018-11-28 23:08:21 So, reconstituting baby powder, what’s the ratio of baby oil to powder? And how much do you need to make one medium-sized baby? The instructions on the bottles are not very detailed
618 2018-11-28 23:08:20 It’s crazy the things my mom made me use while growing up, castor oil, methiolate (sic), @DrTichenor’s etc. I said I wld never use this mess when I grow up. Ha...I now find myself using DT for mouthwash, antiseptic, gargling for sore throats, and acne astringent.#allpurpose

620 2018-11-28 23:08:06 Never put all eggs into one basket... Alberta Govt, Politicians and Industries should learn from Dubai when it comes to Economic Diversification. No point relying only on Oil Production..Why cut production to bump up price for consumers?
621 2018-11-28 23:07:59 I have seen numerous reports of the OWNERS benefiting from the tax breaks, buyouts and layoffs, but none of the workers. Is their any evidence that more gov funding will actually create proper jobs, or will it be a small "oil rush" and than back to layoffs?
622 2018-11-28 23:07:57 How have I got olbas oil in my eye
623 2018-11-28 23:07:52 Current mission in AC Odyssey:

Wtf is going on

624 2018-11-28 23:07:39 どがんしようもなかよね....
625 2018-11-28 23:07:39 Open Secrets, which tracks the donations to candidates and elected officials, shows $ zero from oil or banks to the Beto campaign. Is this crank pushing a fake People's Party posting?
626 2018-11-28 23:07:38 A much needed approach and should be reached quickly, BUT, we, Canadians, have bigger issues to address, like, climate change, diversifing our economy beyond oil - green energy ! Canadian land, water and resource need our protection !

628 2018-11-28 23:07:35 Jupiter oil ordered. Still loads to find to get my altar ready for December 6th #fruitmachinedays
629 2018-11-28 23:07:34 yes fish oil is really good however you want to also make sure you are getting essential fatty acids like Omega 6, 7 and 9's because fish oil is mainly EPA and DHA which you do need. You need sort of like a full spectrum EFA
630 2018-11-28 23:07:27 ...for no other reasons than the Saudis purchase obscene amounts of American military hardware paying mega dollars thereby taking the heat off Israel, and the US wants the oil.
631 2018-11-28 23:07:25 Obama shut down oil production and lobbied against the oil pipelines. Now he wants to take credit for everything. What a liar! All he kept pushing for were green energy programs that made his friends rich and later went out of business. Funnelling taxpayer dollars to his friends
632 2018-11-28 23:07:22 Let me send you some of my beard oil for that magnificent goatee cc @RobbyConklin
633 2018-11-28 23:07:20 Bread with olive oil, basil, and garlic salt.
Mozzarella sticks.
Both air fried.
Ground beef has a different recipe but I forget
634 2018-11-28 23:07:14 Also, the EU just passed policy to be carbon-neutral by 2050.  I think that is still too far away and not ambitious enough but if they can do it there's nothing stopping the rest of the world.  We only need to have the will.  Global dependency on oil doesn't matter after +3.5C.
635 2018-11-28 23:07:12 いつもはピークを過ぎてから病院に行ってたから直ぐに治った気がしたのかな？
今回はかかり始めだったから薬を飲んでもまだピークがきてるのかもですな
今週末のウチにしっかり治しまっす！

637 2018-11-28 23:06:59 日曜工場停電で休み確定したやったぜ
638 2018-11-28 23:06:57 Thanks, I know that in my old job, maintaining oil platform equipment, we often had stuff certified through the manufacturer's home organisation. Would Customs formalities include manufacturing standards though?
639 2018-11-28 23:06:47 Right, how do you even know pancakes won’t absorb motor oil?
What made you test that theory? Lol
640 2018-11-28 23:06:41 Nah I need internet like I need oil
641 2018-11-28 23:06:38 What all that cardboard and motor oil?
642 2018-11-28 23:06:36 I love brussel sprouts! We lightly fry them in coconut oil with some curry powder and garlic salt and it’s amazing

644 2018-11-28 23:06:18 As CA AG, Harris championed three strikes, harsh truancy laws, prison (slave) labor, and capital punishment. Patrick now works at Bain Capital. Booker helped kill Rx importation and worked with DeVos to defund public ed. Beto takes more bribes from oil & gas than anyone but Cruz.
645 2018-11-28 23:06:08 Energy does not equal Big Oil.
646 2018-11-28 23:06:04 Not saying pipeline are a good thing, but it's zillions time safer than all that oil on rails.
647 2018-11-28 23:06:04 そうそう〜！、それにぼーっとしてても寝れるわけじゃないからね〜
648 2018-11-28 23:05:52 I'm also taking a tablespoon of hemp seeds as well as a tablespoon of macadamia nut oil daily. unfortunately most all of us do not get enough essential fatty acids in our diet and there is a huge deficiency in the public
649 2018-11-28 23:05:51 Yes! And to add further irritation, it is illiterate (`not included in that description’) and the writer really doesn’t care. What happened to the grace and good manners that our politicians used to have, and which oil the wheels of commerce and diplomacy
650 2018-11-28 23:05:49 When i went thru my coconut phase i dead was sweating coconut oil for 10 months 
651 2018-11-28 23:05:39 Good Chippy on the Gorgie road next to the white building that looks like a church. They use veggie oil for frying - always a bonus.
652 2018-11-28 23:05:36 Little olive oil, salt, minced garlic — amazing. And it doesn’t hurt my stomach.
653 2018-11-28 23:05:29 don’t even try to fool me 
that’s motor oil
654 2018-11-28 23:05:28 We had a wonderful 1st session for both oil and watercolor classes at the Village Art Circle, LLC yesterday. Here are the two demos from the two classes.
655 2018-11-28 23:05:25 Oil money ruining “European royalty”, I love this game.
656 2018-11-28 23:05:25 SUGAR      OIL          THATS IT
657 2018-11-28 23:05:14 Oil check: Oil can react differently to cold temperatures, so it’s always good to stay up-to-date on your oil changes.
658 2018-11-28 23:05:12 if I was on the titanic once I knew it was 100% going to sink and I wasn’t going to be on a boat, I would run to the kitchen slather myself in butter and oil for insulation, get a door as a float, jump off with it and get far away from anyone who would try n take it off me
659 2018-11-28 23:05:12 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. James 5:14
660 2018-11-28 23:05:10 One of my biggest pet peeve. People being against pipelines. How the fuck do they think oil will be moved? Duh, by train, which goes right through urban areas. People are so dumb.
661 2018-11-28 23:05:09 hey I ate truffle mac and cheese forgetting I hate truffle oil and now my burps taste like it. what will cover this taste?? help! asap!!! no sex answers
662 2018-11-28 23:05:09 I don't have the context for your tweet and am trying to more fully understand the issues re: oil and gas in Alberta (I know the court decision on pipeline and low prices for crude oil) and resultant potential job losses....
663 2018-11-28 23:04:57 Pls what oil exactly do u use for your face??
664 2018-11-28 23:04:57 These are inefficient wars for Israel not oil
665 2018-11-28 23:04:46 He's not stealing money, Kk. So how the 2.8 billion Naira oil money FELA sang about? Who stole it? You have any idea how much that is today? Stop the fuckery please
666 2018-11-28 23:03:55 I sometimes think ‘tech’ coverage is a weird category for journalism. We don’t really group new oil drilling techniques, Ford’s latest SUV, teenaged drink-driving and urban planning all together under ‘car coverage’.
667 2018-11-28 23:03:52 Not true.
I’ve tried a few things that taste good. 
Crappy alcohol tastes like motor oil.
668 2018-11-28 23:03:52 Thought I had to get a oil change whole time these niggas aint reset my shit the last time i got one 
669 2018-11-28 23:03:46 Back when oil was $140 a barrel Obama said “we can’t drill our way out of this shortage”.  A true visionary 
670 2018-11-28 23:03:42 Be interesting to hear what rail line they sit on for months.  Rail lines already have trouble moving all the grain and oil.   More cars need more railroad, not going to help much.
671 2018-11-28 23:03:36 Ive never tried the tea, but i know the oil works wonders!! The teaeould probably taste a ehole lot better. I love you btw. I wish we were friends
672 2018-11-28 23:03:34 the Bush’s a bunch of phony balonys nwo east coast leftists in republican clothing. Left our kids behind in education our nation behind in rejuvenation & debt then befriended public enemy #1 Barry O who shut down coal &amp; oil. What a liar!!!
673 2018-11-28 23:03:27 Got a fresh bottle of baby oil. I am soooo excited you guys. Going to film some content and play on Snapchat

675 2018-11-28 23:03:20 And he's at it again!!!! #Obama takes full credit for the Oil Boom, first it was the #Economy, people. Don't you ever forget it, either!!! He also wants you to know #Trump is the Narcissist , k?
676 2018-11-28 23:03:10 Hit dude up with your beard oil. 
677 2018-11-28 23:02:56 By blending it together with my fingers  I use oil based paint and work with the layers when they're a little wet, kinda like blending contour with foundation  it photographs a little better than it looks irl 
678 2018-11-28 23:02:55 Oil it up?
679 2018-11-28 23:02:50 My dash board beeping constantly like it’s gonna make me change my oil any sooner
680 2018-11-28 23:02:48 one thing I'm looking forward to about self-driving cars is that I chuck my car on its shoulder and tell it to take itself for an oil change
681 2018-11-28 23:02:45 My fingers smell like motor oil and I didn’t even touch anything like that today while working.  The hell???
682 2018-11-28 23:02:41 So you are good with a big tax hike to cover the lack of federal revenue from the oil industry?
683 2018-11-28 23:02:33 Obama admitted he hated fossil fuels & did his best close coal mines & restrict oil pipelines, and Obama’s Marxist regime passed thousands of regulations basically killing coal & oil industry!  And it because of him America is leading the world in oil production? What a joke!
684 2018-11-28 23:02:33 #unifor cars needs oil  - angry red oil
685 2018-11-28 23:02:31 I like an essential oil blend called Panaway for aches and the tincture of clove reminiscence had me just run to look at the container's label...
Cloves is one! =)
(Peeps tell me I smell like Christmas when I have a smidge of it on lol)
686 2018-11-28 23:02:28 しかもゲームとかで寝落ちしようとしても風邪引いててなんかそれすらだるいし....
687 2018-11-28 23:02:27 Its a huge and mince chance he can get locked in #Argentina  ,if he get away with a blood in his hand from there ,it mean we not humanz anymore ,a drop of oil worth more than driping blood #khashoggi
688 2018-11-28 23:02:22 It just proves how incompetent he was ... he wanted to kill US Carbon energy industry ... instead fracking exploded on his watch, US became a leading Oil exporter, and it drove international oil prices down.
689 2018-11-28 23:02:15 Oil was stable for the most part until NatGas ran higher. It was definitely a pair trade blowing up again. Almost minute to minute move.
690 2018-11-28 23:02:12 People really be drinking alcohol as if it actually tastes good. It tastes like motor oil
691 2018-11-28 23:01:57 Is this all about retaliation on the prince! If so it's going to cost the US many contracts and loss of jobs! Since we are oil independent why not a massive reduction in Saudi oil imports! Think about it did we ever punish Mexico when press killings spiked they weren't all cartel

712 2018-11-28 23:00:21 I’m sorry Trump actions is very similar to Bush.  Ignore those who do bad things.  Oil is king and it has put blood on all tax payers hands because no one speaks out.  Democrat or Republican they are both corrupt.  Trump keeps proving it every time he stays silent on Saudi Arabia
713 2018-11-28 23:00:14 He tried to shut down fracking, pipelines and coal mines and gave failed green energy and solar companies billions of our taxpayers' money, and now he wants credit for creating oil independence? He's delusional, among other evil things!
714 2018-11-28 23:00:06 I thought they are there to liberate oppressed Syrian people and bring them democracy and freedom!!?? That is what Trump , one before him and many other US politicians said multiple times! Now suddenly it is because of oil  LOL,  at least bit of honesty at end!

719 2018-11-28 22:59:41 Obama is just jealous Trump is doing double what obama promised the people couldn’t be done. He is even trying to take credit for the low oil pricing
720 2018-11-28 22:59:39 Ah, sorry, but Obama is right.  Under his watch US became oil EXPORTER finally. Obama brought nation back from brink of Depression.  Under O Dow gained 185% from 2009 low.  Obama gave us ACA for 1st time ever.

Get your facts straight...nah.  It's just more fun to hate, right?!

723 2018-11-28 22:59:20 I really don't get the whole "Lets protect people in oil" thing. No one protected blacksmiths when factories became a thing or stablehands when cars became a thing. It's called "technological advancement" & as long as there's innovation there's nothing u can do about it
724 2018-11-28 22:59:16 ありがとうございます
725 2018-11-28 22:59:13 Since oil is still higher than any time in the O admin, we ain't happy yet. Take some more bribes to lower the price some more. I wish oil stayed at $100. Fracking profitable and solar/wind cheaper than oil. #GreenNewDeal is needed.
726 2018-11-28 22:59:05 according toObama all the accomplishments of Donald trump, the blistering good economy, the fact were number one in oil production is because of barrack Obama, FACTS ARE OBAMA BLOCKED OIL PRODUCTION ATTEMPTS AS DID ALL DEMOCRATS. OBAMA GDP 1.5% TRUMP GDP 4.5%. OBAMA IS A LIAR.

728 2018-11-28 22:58:52 My message to the USA is this. Get out of Syria immediately. Stop wagging the dog with Iran. Stop funding Israel. And arrest the Trump administration and send them to the Hague on war crime charges. The USA has no legal or moral authority whatsoever. Go home. No more oil wars.
729 2018-11-28 22:58:46 Guy at the oil change place is so pissed they keep checking his car for issues and telling him about it. He just wants in and out, doesn’t care all his back lights are out. But I’m sure he’ll complain when he gets pulled over lol

745 2018-11-28 22:57:37 Don’t think so highly of yourself to think man could massively control the climate. Only a fool would believe the snake oil salesman over climate change. What happened to global warming. It was a lie. S E, I’m disappointed in you.
746 2018-11-28 22:57:26 NOT ENOUGH!!  WHAT DID THEY DIE FOR????  PLEASE DON'T TELL US IT'S "PROTECTING OUR FREEDOMS".  IT'S NOT!!  WE'RE ONLY IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, ETC. IN ORDER TO TAKE THE OIL AND CONTROL THE REGION.

However, more and more people around the WORLD are learning that the main stream medias are vomiting lies JUST to cover up the real intention of taking over the OIL.
755 2018-11-28 22:56:17 I believe the idea is to stop the glut of supply for our specific oil so existing inventories are depleted and could speed the recovery in prices .... it's common for OPEC to curtail supply as well - Google why they do it

757 2018-11-28 22:56:13 We might just do what Norway has done with their oil, sell it to the world and put the money away for a rainy day. Use what we have plenty of wind and wave, hydro would do well also. Don't have to base it off that, we have much more than that to make enough and more.

768 2018-11-28 22:55:45 I look forward to your daily insightful market analysis videos. I agree that we’re in a filly right now with oil. Although it’s almost worth the risk to somewhat get a deal done.Saudis wants to tackle the Asian oil Importers, but many including Russia say they will cut.

836 2018-11-28 22:50:04 Ok thank you Obama...for taking your foot off the neck of the economy AND the oil industry when you left the White House. There I thanked him for all of us!
837 2018-11-28 22:49:59 thank u!!! i don’t take vitamins BUT i only wash my hair once a week, and the night before washing it i massage aloe vera and almond oil into my scalp and the ends of my hair, then i tie my hair up into an old t shirt, go to sleep, then wash it the next day :)
838 2018-11-28 22:49:55 Other than changing a tire, changing your oil is literally the easiest thing

840 2018-11-28 22:49:47 1) he was clearly not being serious (you can hear repeated laughter), he wasn’t bragging.

2) setting CO2 goals and implementing other policies to mitigate climate change aren’t mutually exclusive to the USA becoming the biggest oil producer because now we export oil.
841 2018-11-28 22:49:41 Uh excuse me for wondering what you’re  smokin because obviously @BarackObama your recollection of events and how much pride you took in shutting down oil & coal has escaped your memory and been replaced with some pretty awesome hallucinations of self serving grandeur.
842 2018-11-28 22:49:41 1. The UCP plan calls for first step to ammend the Mines and Minerals Act to include bitumen with definition of petroleum. Without this change (which will likely require extending the fall session), only light oil producers are prorated. The #ABParty plan wouldn't solve problem.

844 2018-11-28 22:49:36 @pepboysauto Today I had to return because two weeks ago I paid $100 bucks for oil change, so why is my oil light reading low? Apparently, the work wasn’t done! Store#0844
845 2018-11-28 22:49:30 CRUDE OIL was falling again, WTI dropped 170 PIPS and landed at 50.00 USD per barrel, which is well known psychological level; will it go through this time?

849 2018-11-28 22:49:16 LOL, you're going to anger the climatology gods Aaron. I have no idea what the goal of perpetuating the global cooling/next ice age/global warming/climate change hype would be. I can only point to environmentalists intent on putting the oil industry out of business.
850 2018-11-28 22:49:09 #pnpcbc
This panel doesn't seem to get it.  Oil is going out of business and the first companies to go will be the Tar Sand producers. What about the environment?

852 2018-11-28 22:49:03 sometimes i will make a shot w/ juiced ginger, garlic, lemon juice and oil of oregano, but when i don't have the right tools or time I'll just take a few drops of oil of oregano and eat a clove or two of raw garlic separately!

854 2018-11-28 22:48:40 It is by far not the worst thing, #palmoil production does to the earth and us. Look on your #protein bar, @Hersheys,  @mars, @Nestle , @spruengli_, @Lindt_Chocolate  before buying. It's the cheapest oil you can get, one of the least helpful & least healthy oils for your body.
855 2018-11-28 22:48:38 His energy policy was totally about killing the oil and coal industry and weakening the USA in yet another way.

857 2018-11-28 22:48:35 What if they sent one out every time one GM plant’s worth of employees lost their jobs in the oil patch?

863 2018-11-28 22:47:40 *Externally* used, though (and I've seen it done), milk doesn't make much difference. Shifts a *little* of the oil that the skin has picked up, but not nearly enough to stop the pain.

866 2018-11-28 22:47:27 What's caused more Middle East upheaval? The spread of Saudi Wahhabism  or anything the Iranians have done? 911 hijackers 15 of 19 were Saudi.  US was involved in overthrowing the Iranian gov and supported Britain  over Iran when it came to OIL.
867 2018-11-28 22:47:27 @Tzeporah Premier Notley continually compares Western Cdn Select to West Texas Intermediate. Is there not a remarkable difference in the two in that West Texas Internediate is a far more refined oil? a sweet light crude? in comparison to AB’s unrefined bitumen? #cdnpoli #ableg
868 2018-11-28 22:47:21 Fossil fuel emissions are supposed to be a leading contributor to climate change.
Obama now says the massive increase in oil supply is due to him.
Conclusion: Obama is trying to destroy the planet.
869 2018-11-28 22:47:12 The oil sands crisis and the GM closure are not unrelated. Both are reflective of changes in the economy and the failure of our politicians to understand this. Interventions to move to a green economy are needed and were needed. Instead pols think only about re-election. #PnPcbc
870 2018-11-28 22:47:12 It also went up on private land due to shale/fracking, in SPITE of Obama stopping it on Federal land and making millions more oil rich acres of land off limits for drilling, along with offshore drilling.

873 2018-11-28 22:46:56 In fact my interest in the oil business is due to the greatest tv character ever jr Ewing
874 2018-11-28 22:46:50 Haha....Bush wishes he had the intelligence to orchestrated it! All I know is there is one GOD they're interested in gold, oil, drugs. Look at the countries UK,  USA & Israel start wars with and look at their land value. Why hasn't Johnny gone and fought for Palestinian freedom??
875 2018-11-28 22:46:46 For Fucksake, what's wrong with a regular old hand job, clingfilm rubber glove, warm potnoodle, cooking oil and a wooden spoon.
Ppl today are just fuckin weird 
876 2018-11-28 22:46:45 Sadly, the only way US will accept Venezuelan oil is through a US-backed coup followed by a puppet dictatorship that allows economic conquest by the US of Venezuela.
877 2018-11-28 22:46:37 1. How many years does it take to bring a new gas/oil drill into production?
2. How long does it take to recoup the costs?
3. In the time it takes to do 1. & 2. How much oil/gas demand is reduced b/c we bring up more renewable energy plants online & electric vehicles?
878 2018-11-28 22:46:27 Stop sourcing palm oil and destroying rainforests. How can you continue to do this at a time wherethe wildlife population has fallen by 60%? As well as Climate Change knocking at our doors?
879 2018-11-28 22:46:27 @PnPCBC:Here is my 3 part WCS plan:1. Legislate slow CA oil extraction,what’s the point of selling resources if u pay as much 2 extract it as u sell it .2. Feds Embargo oil from all nations except EU UK US 3.Drop plan to add oil trains.CP & CN R @ capacity goods will b stranded
880 2018-11-28 22:46:26 Actually, IF you had your finger on the pulse in Scotland you'd realise that ALL of our different revenue streams around renewable energies are in the next few years expected to be bigger than oil. Perhaps go watch a showing of NATION : NORWAY
881 2018-11-28 22:46:23 Mountain Dew uses Brominated vegetable oil, an emulsifier in soda/sports drinks, preventing the flavoring from separating and floating to the surface. The ingredient is banned more than 100 countries because it contains  bromine, a chemical whose vapors can be corrosive or toxic.
882 2018-11-28 22:46:17 Lost in ALL conversations on Russia is the fact that their economy is 10% of ours and that 60+% of their budget is oil dependent. Ignore them. Frack, baby, frack.
883 2018-11-28 22:46:17 Exactly! His goal was complete dependence on foreign oil and to keep coal plants closed. He also took credit for the stock market! That guy smoked too much weed!

887 2018-11-28 22:45:49 Super happy I found an advent calendar that doesn't use palm oil. Well done @thorntonschocs (but also maybe remove palm oil from the rest of your chocs because I'd like to buy them too) 
888 2018-11-28 22:45:46 still can’t believe they use motor oil for syrup

890 2018-11-28 22:45:39 It’s not rumor, it’s fact. She is inordinately wealthy from oil and gas lobbyists and big Pharma. These are facts. Google is your friend
891 2018-11-28 22:45:24 I totally agree but I also really hate the game and don't enjoy playing it lol.

"It's like heroin" might be true for some people but for me it's like injecting myself with motor oil, it slowly kills me
892 2018-11-28 22:45:18 Apparently US oil manufacturers are planning to drill domestically a lot more. I think we’re tapping into our reserves, and I hope the oil companies have a plan to transition into renewable energy while using domestic oil to sustain in the meantime.
893 2018-11-28 22:45:10 The GM issue (who didn't see that coming?) is an immediate problem, while the oil problem is a long, slow economic death that is and will have far-reaching consequences.
894 2018-11-28 22:45:06 But wait, I thought Senator Obama said gas prices were Bush's fault, then President Obama said he didn't have control over oil prices, is he back to Senator Obama now?
895 2018-11-28 22:44:59 You have a #Hairball ? They say castor oil works good to dislodge them. Hope this helps you.

899 2018-11-28 22:44:24 Russia is one of the biggest trade partner of Türkiye. Russia sell oil and gas. Turkiye sell food, textile, diamond. And millions of russian tourists are visiting Turkiye. It is very easy to use local currencies for trade.
900 2018-11-28 22:44:22 I’m just sitting here waiting on my oil change and this white lady passing by just told these two Mexican guys behind her to “speak English I don’t understand what you’re saying” UMMMM ain’t nobody even talking to you the fuck? She’s lucky she walked fast

WE USE BUTTER IN THIS HOUSE, DAVID. GET WITH THE PROGRAM.
904 2018-11-28 22:44:07 Question: if the problem could be solved by shipping more oil by rail, why isn't the market taking care of this problem? Not enough rail capacity? If so, is it railway or rail cars? If the latter, why isn't someone buying them & making it happen?
905 2018-11-28 22:44:01 Hopkins. You really are an oil slick of a human being. The shit pours out your mouth like a sewage outflow pipe. The exception being that the outlet pipe probably makes more coherent noises than you. Standing on the edge of the world? You must be a flat earther too. Fu@k me.

907 2018-11-28 22:43:44 Wouldn’t it be nice if the Liberals, NDP and Conservatives got together behind closed doors and tried to fix the Oil transportation problem, The GM debacle and maybe try and do something for Canada. I know I’m a dreamer but I’m not the only one. #JohnLennon
908 2018-11-28 22:43:42 Pls just the thought makes me want to puke. The only good thing they have is their oil but there’s plenty of other oils to choose from that are much more flavorful. So
909 2018-11-28 22:43:38 They are both bad, but once the oil is gone, it’s gone.  We can bring back manufacturing jobs.  We can’t replenish the oil once it’s sold.
910 2018-11-28 22:43:31 @cnn there is absolutely ZERO value in @RickSantorum joining your network. He is a paid lobbyist for oil & gas companies.
911 2018-11-28 22:43:29 going to try oil cleansing my face tonight but I've read so many blogs on it I'm overwhelmed
912 2018-11-28 22:43:26 And on fracking, the coal industry, new oil exploration and drilling, against all of it. He’s delusional, smoking the pipe too much.
913 2018-11-28 22:43:23 oil change & extra crap to make sure my car is all good... making this a business expense fo sho.
914 2018-11-28 22:43:07 Reminds me of a story about Midnight Oil playing a festival in the NT and seeing they were on at 6 o'clock and one of them saying "should we have dinner before or after?" then someone explained their set time was AM, not PM.
915 2018-11-28 22:43:07 I am going on a grand adventure with my father and uncle. They have recently been to Constantinople and plan to take me with them to Mongolia to deliver oil from the lamp of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We also have a letter for the emperor of Mongolia.
916 2018-11-28 22:43:04 The Keystone Pipeline brings CANADIAN oil through the US!  This feed has the biggest gathering of idiots in one place I have ever seen 
917 2018-11-28 22:42:57 I was just using the money I paid in when I worked in the oil field
918 2018-11-28 22:42:54 Let’s not forget the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf while he was president   Ugh
919 2018-11-28 22:42:51 This obviously just my opinion. Numbers in market meant as guides as to where this Powell put is. He looks at economy not mkt. caveat: low oil gives legit cover to back off. And quietly being lobbied by bond dealers to either stop raising rates or stop offloading balance sheet.
920 2018-11-28 22:42:48 Thinking about the GM closure in Oshawa, here's the question: if the government can find $4billion to buy an oil pipeline, why can't we find $4B to create a fund to support zero emissions vehicle development in Canada?
921 2018-11-28 22:42:43 I gotta find time to change my oil and other fluids this week
922 2018-11-28 22:42:39 Most Americans might think all their oil comes from the Saudis.
923 2018-11-28 22:42:38 It would advance energy independence greatly if we put a tariff on imported oil.
924 2018-11-28 22:42:35 I think BP got sued! But honestly.. there's some regulation where offshore oil companies are required to keep a certain type of insurance and because of regulations the total they're liable for is capped at a fixed price. If it was a free market they would've paid even more.
925 2018-11-28 22:42:33 As someone in the oil industry... Bringing Iran back into the global economy was a major reason Saudi gave TX a "good sweating" in late 2014.

And Yes, that was Obama's foreign policy decision.

And yes, that can be criticized for creating chaos in proxy war locations in the ME.
926 2018-11-28 22:42:28 You're a criminal, same as every politician currently in office. You're lying. Saudi Arabia is full of terrorists & you're overlooking brutal murder for oil. Please stop lying, free innocent #JulianAssange. Citizens are sick of govt.criminals being free
#freeJulianAssange NOW
927 2018-11-28 22:42:26 I hope everyone enjoys the ensuing oil and gas price increases  just as the winter heating oil season starts. Non-homeowners can expect a rent hike.
928 2018-11-28 22:42:26 There is something called “Actual delivery rule”, if the “exchange” doesn’t settle the trade in 28 days, it falls under the jurisdiction of CFTC.
And since crypto isn’t oil or pork bellies CFTC would like to reduce this period to 3 or even 1 days.
929 2018-11-28 22:42:23 I love how now ppl be all like that’s not syrup it’s oil or it’s not whip cream it’s shaving cream etc. that shit mad funny to me
930 2018-11-28 22:42:22 Because a LNG spill is nowhere near as serious as a dilbit oil spill. And I have no idea what you’re upset about. It’s a fact overall tanker sailing will increase by about a factor of 7. That’s more than one a day.
931 2018-11-28 22:42:18 Oil and opium? What a disgrace, karma will find you
932 2018-11-28 22:42:16 Aww here bud... a head melt your dealing with... wtf!!... such fear you both must be feeling in amongst all that love for each other... hugs to you both.. I wish you both blessings galore...  oh and get him on that special oil  you now... that one
933 2018-11-28 22:42:13 He is taking credit for Ttrumps accomplishments because he didn't have any. Taking credit for #1 in oil production is laughable..
Anwar, Dakota pipeline, easing restrictions n drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. All from President Trump. Obama is getting to be pathetic .
934 2018-11-28 22:42:04 omg HOW i’ve always wanted to get into oils but even to just start you have to commit hardcore with like. a canvas and oil paints and mediums and a mixing plate and knife and UGH OH MY GOD
935 2018-11-28 22:41:58 ugggghhh even draining the oil is fucking horrible fuck everything about that.

saw some post in r/watchpeopledieinside where some dude cleaning up the kitchen at the end of a shift dumped the whole bucket of oil on the floor.

i died too.
936 2018-11-28 22:41:57 Also ran is what you’ve been your whole life till oil money arrived

944 2018-11-28 22:41:12 That’s because drumpf doesn’t want to screw up the deals he made with them for the trump organization  deals are too good to lose  it has nothing to do with America  Saudi needs  American arms  not America needs Saudi oil he sides with a murder for his deal making America crap 
945 2018-11-28 22:41:11 That’s just oil, wash ya face 
946 2018-11-28 22:41:01 You asked for it senator 
But remember when  you end this war and Iran takes control of the Arabian golf and Red Sea and threaten all oil shipments out so they can rise the price way way up  and Blake mail you don’t ask Saudi Arabia for help then
947 2018-11-28 22:40:57 Oh and by the way did you know Obama just took credit for increasing oil production? 
Think he was in the pocket of Big Oil or just a narcissistic liar. (and a racist)
948 2018-11-28 22:40:57 Didn't the oil boom started with FRACKING??

Was the drilling (FRACKING) on Federal land or private land??

Didn't the Dimwits said NO TO AMWR??

Talking about delusional!!
949 2018-11-28 22:40:52 I’m going to get my self a Christmas gift a day at a spa with hot oil massage 
950 2018-11-28 22:40:36 NGL changing oil is one of the easiest maintenance a person can do themselves for a car. $20 for oil. If you don't have any tools probably another $20

Oil change places always try to upsell, some give commission to the seller so that's why they try to do that.
951 2018-11-28 22:40:33 You know it's very important to be informed before typing such crap!  You talk about shop rite and all that nonsense... Try Nigeria pulling it's oil from SA or Dangote group pulling their investment from your cement industry. U actually get more from Nigeria than U think dude!

953 2018-11-28 22:40:10 We send oil too the states for cheap. Comes back here and US charges us an arm and leg. Thank you USA we were always there for you all. That's just one thing so far
954 2018-11-28 22:40:06 Endless oil story
955 2018-11-28 22:40:05 I also disagree with coconut oil. Like, there's a jar on my counter that claims to be coconut oil, but I disagree. I don't believe it

963 2018-11-28 22:39:10 I got a spot of oil under my arm when I was cooking and the result was: I don’t deserve to eat. I’m going to bed. Will try again tomorrow.
964 2018-11-28 22:39:06 Pittsburgh PA is home to the best French fries around. Any of the fresh cut ones cooked in peanut oil.
965 2018-11-28 22:39:01 great get your oil fields back-
966 2018-11-28 22:38:56 You bought yourselves a jar of snake oil and now all you can do is live with it. Sure glad my state didn’t get duped by that orangutan bastard.
967 2018-11-28 22:38:49 help i’ve started to put coconut oil on my face and i can’t stop
968 2018-11-28 22:38:36 People say "I disagree with being transgender" like it's not an objective fact that we exist.  Our existence isn't debatable.  Here's a few other things that exist that you can also disagree with:

Oxygen
The 1995 film "Jumanji"
Coconut oil
The color periwinkle
Pretzels
969 2018-11-28 22:38:31 Are you saying that trade with rUK would cease? Will rUK not want to buy independent Scotland's electricity, gas, oil, water, and food? In addition, Scotland has been rUK's #CashCowColony for decades and that will stop post independence.
970 2018-11-28 22:38:27 Why don't we use all that oil slimey sex pest Salmond said we had?
971 2018-11-28 22:38:25 It may not seem it, but, Trump has him in check, possibly check mate.
Notice falling oil prices. Yet rising in countries closer to Saudi Arabia, France. This could act as a vice, ever tightening.
972 2018-11-28 22:38:21 Ive never said Scotland is subsidised by England, all ive said is this reliance on the oil and the delusion that you get nothing from the union is massively flawed
973 2018-11-28 22:38:11 21st Century snake oil seller/grifter #rolluprollup
974 2018-11-28 22:38:08 Canada NDP lawmaker on @CTV_PowerPlay said gas prices have not declined in unison with drop in crude oil. I saw gas priced under $1 a litre on Sunday in Beacon Hill area of Ottawa.
975 2018-11-28 22:37:59 I’m down to burn that midnight oil with ya my man 
976 2018-11-28 22:37:54 my dad wouldn’t even think to ask if i’ve checked the oil in my car lately, he knows good and well i would never check that
977 2018-11-28 22:37:54 Me watching the bk pancake commercial: there's cardboard between each pancake, the syrup is motor oil, and the butter is cut by a heated utensil sliding down cold pancakes
978 2018-11-28 22:37:49 I hope everyone enjoys a big heating oil price hike just as winter starts. If you're not a home owner your rents will increase.

Christmas Joy!
979 2018-11-28 22:37:47 Shea butter coconut oil and  ridi oil I can't remember the English name  and mix them together
980 2018-11-28 22:37:47 Better get some tracks and diesel engines. Railways won't let lumber and grain suffer to move oil.  
New engines required as they will be antique by time pipeline gets built.
981 2018-11-28 22:37:46 I thought you hated oil you dolt. Where’s your Chevy Volt ???#KeystonePipeline ring a bell?
982 2018-11-28 22:37:35 Governments should push through pipelines and oil refinery red tape.  Industry can do rest. .
983 2018-11-28 22:37:22 i had a long day n im cold n my feet hurt but something keeping me going is thinking about the motor oil pancake syrup..i don't kno why
984 2018-11-28 22:37:13 Dude people at the oil change place always try to upsell the shit out of you 
985 2018-11-28 22:37:12 Is there anything this man won’t take credit for except a sluggish economy, horrible health care, shutting down oil fields, trying to get rid off fracking, and gassing people at the border. He’s just kinda pathetic isn’t he?
986 2018-11-28 22:37:05 Hiring a publicist and constantly telling people how great you are two vastly different things. Comparing the two is like comparing oil and water.
987 2018-11-28 22:36:58 But remember when the oil explosion happened in the Gulf of Mexico? The Obama administration erroneously called the company BP, "British" Petroleum. And said they would keep their "boot on its neck." Fascist and xenophobic.
988 2018-11-28 22:36:57 @Condor_Law I was just commenting about yout tweet where Obama was taking credit for being top oil producing country and your tweet just disappeared. I'm thinking @jack is targeting you. Just letting you know.
989 2018-11-28 22:36:55 Dealerships have the best oil.
990 2018-11-28 22:36:50 HAHAHA i went to get an oil change and i didn’t know you had to pay. i honestly thought they just mixed up the oil or something idk. i had no clue you have to pick out the oil and everything
991 2018-11-28 22:36:46 Places in Kansas & Missouri oil country as hell but it's still Midwest. Just like Oklahoma us to me 
992 2018-11-28 22:36:35 Let me fix that for you: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was in spite of me people ..."
993 2018-11-28 22:36:35 Take there oil  
994 2018-11-28 22:36:34 That’s the one I’m looking for tickets for! I’ve never been to Lucas Oil. Vivid seats seems like the best price but stub hub has better choices  thank you for your help!!
995 2018-11-28 22:36:32 Operación Vista Oil
996 2018-11-28 22:36:30 That makes too much sense bill. We picked the wealthy, oil producing side, make our money and then turn a blind eye.
997 2018-11-28 22:36:19 I tried it w/ACV by itself first but it burned so I added tea tree oil in it and it helped
998 2018-11-28 22:36:15 L’une des pires sensations c’est quand t’as envie de prendre quelqu’un dans tes bras mais que tu ne peux pas parce qu’il est trop loin.
999 2018-11-28 22:36:15 Yes, there is some oil but even more natural gas on continental shelf offshore of Crimea in Ukraine's Russian-occupied exclusive economic zone (EEZ under 1982 UNCLOS) However, Crimea more important to Russia as a power projection platform to control/threaten the Black Sea Region
1000 2018-11-28 22:36:10 All the kids here in UT lost their oil jobs too.  And now they’re all back to work thanks to #Trump
1001 2018-11-28 22:36:09 I successfully drained the oil in the gen, put fresh oil and turned on the gen! I’m stronger than I thought 
First attempt 
1002 2018-11-28 22:36:02 TBH - that was what bothered me the most :D

At that point I just figured he was corrupt and the assistant hadn't got the memo. It was that bad. Made John Moss competent. And he drinks motor oil from a shoe.
1003 2018-11-28 22:36:00 He can take an oil rig and shove it
1004 2018-11-28 22:35:54 A positive step in the right direction - now mandatory palm oil content labelling needed on food items. #savetheorangutan #saynotopalmoil
1005 2018-11-28 22:35:53 Peppermint oil for menstrual cramps saves lives
1006 2018-11-28 22:35:53 What we mean by the Next Level
-Looters will be jailed
-Oil wells will be revoked
-Corruption will be buried

1007 2018-11-28 22:35:46 Bubble bath, coconut oil caked on my lips, and a big glass of ice water is where it is at my dudezzzzz
1008 2018-11-28 22:35:32 La refinería de Oil combustibles quebró,murió  con este gobierno pero el que se robó toda la plata fue Cristobal  López. Hay que ver cómo venía Alco, igual Macri es un pelotudo inservible, lo voté, pero volver al pasado tampoco por favor.
1009 2018-11-28 22:35:25 Of course OIL.  Oil contributed to the coffers in Ottawa to a huge degree.   The Auto Industry is constantly being supported by taxpayers in Canada.
1010 2018-11-28 22:35:11 Shea butter doesn’t work, I hear the snake oil works but it’s scarce
1011 2018-11-28 22:35:11 (Probably baby oil or lip scrub/mask)
1012 2018-11-28 22:35:07 Kid in my class, in regards to the gulf oil spill: “All we need are two buckets and a patient man.”
1013 2018-11-28 22:34:52 So he makes oil? Wow, that is pretty impressive
1014 2018-11-28 22:34:52 Yeah - Obama.  He did nothing for eight years but get our oil and gas business going.  Uh huh.  He also said you could keep your Doctor
1015 2018-11-28 22:34:46 Buying lots of lubricant for personal use doesn't restore an oil economy.
1016 2018-11-28 22:34:45 oh yes that is stronger...good comparison Tony.
1017 2018-11-28 22:34:45 everyone just put some lavender essential oil in your diffuser and calm down
1018 2018-11-28 22:34:31 Rail firms in Canada are booming. But then there are more tanker cars getting oil to you. We sell you 40% of your oil at a neighbourly low price.
1019 2018-11-28 22:34:30 President Obama: We don't want anymore oil because it's bad for the environment!

Former President Obama: I built the oil industry. *smug face*
1020 2018-11-28 22:34:30 And the oil spilled by pipelines in the oceans would suffice for all jets and cars daily use.
1021 2018-11-28 22:34:30 I remember my Grandad sipping a slice of bread into the meat fat as the meat was cooking (hot oil/juices) then letting the fat set a day or two and using the fat for dripping! I remember eating tripe, loved it! Cows hoof in water for a soup. Then ate the hoof once it went soft!
1022 2018-11-28 22:34:25 Wait a minute. Last night, in Houston, Obama said America was the largest oil producer due to him. Who are these really smart oil guys you’re talking about???
1023 2018-11-28 22:34:14 It’s an attempt to mask his failures to his base.
Trump won these people over as a snake oil salesman on the premise he would solve their economic anxiety and rebuild the middle class with further upward mobility.
The reality is he swooped in to grab their last pound of flesh.
1024 2018-11-28 22:34:13 Nothing more than posturing.....well, and oil.....
1025 2018-11-28 22:34:09 This nigga on my snap dead just HMU and was like ew you’re still smoking honey combs lmk I got match carts best shit out there. LET ME fuckin TELL U SOMETHING MATCH CARTS ARE SO HORRIBLE FOR U THE OIL QUALITY IS ASS WHY DOES HE THINK THEYRE VALID?! Someone been playing him
1026 2018-11-28 22:34:07 Isn’t the US the biggest oil producer because of fracking?
1027 2018-11-28 22:34:07 For example, Exxon Mobil and BP. They both are oil extractors. They probably run similar software in their data centers. Carr says this is wasteful. He over looks the fact why they run similar software. Their goals are essentially the same.
1028 2018-11-28 22:34:03 He fought the oil companies right & left. Those of us who had family/friends who worked in the business knew this. BO loves throwing that you didn't build this line. It was not his $, expertise, or hard work that enabled this title.
1029 2018-11-28 22:34:03 I make my chicken super simple. I grill it on our little grill maker and put olive oil, pepper, & a bit of poultry seasoning on it before I start to grill it. Or you can dice it/cut the chicken into strips and put it in a pot on the stove with olive oil, onions, bell peppers, etc
1030 2018-11-28 22:33:54 ダメだ、それはちひろの罠だ！(おめっと！？
1031 2018-11-28 22:33:47 My friend swears by evening primrose oil and heating pads too. I like a hot water bottle but I’ve never tried the oil!
1032 2018-11-28 22:33:43 Why would we want to protect the country of the 9-11 hijackers? Oh yeah, OIL.
1033 2018-11-28 22:33:34 Pain getting pretty severe in the Permian. Midland-based WTI sold today at $6.75-$7 bbl off WTI futures, or just $44 bbl in some cases. The President likes low oil prices, but no one has a precise thermostat for global crude numbers.
1034 2018-11-28 22:33:26 Somebody has to 'fund' Saudi Arabia? Did their oil run out?
1035 2018-11-28 22:33:07 Macro: Insane historical fast setback in the oil price. But I think the $50-60 is the 'healthiest'. Brexit analysis out by Bank of England. UK GDP can decrease by 9.3% over 15 years with a no-deal. Looking forward to the G20 meeting - hope for a deal of some sort btw China and US
1036 2018-11-28 22:33:07 Obamass sits in that enormous chair( to offset his ego or gen(7@lia) and claims it’s him with the release of new oil. Thought that was Trump w/ Keystone pipeline and Anwar province in Alaska?  Did I miss something? Did he have an affair w MB’s? This man is delusional.Still a puke
1037 2018-11-28 22:32:52 Gas prices were very low under Obama. I have several friends who went and worked at these oil rigs that popped up in ND and SD because of fracking. He’s not wrong. He just doesn’t say it like Trump.
1038 2018-11-28 22:32:46 A daily check for the machine.from the engine oil, water or coolant levels,any loose Nat's and bolts ,any leakages.
1039 2018-11-28 22:32:38 Today, my grandmother said heat causes malaria. 
Last week, it was taking excess groundnut oil (ororo)
1040 2018-11-28 22:32:32 Your $80M/day premise is debunked hooey. These appeasement sops to the oil lobby will not win their support but they have lost you mine.
1041 2018-11-28 22:32:27 No, people are buying SUV's because of their preference for them, bolstered by lower oil prices and more fuel efficient vehicles that make them more affordable than they had been a decade ago. You would understand this if you weren't *checks notes* stupid
1042 2018-11-28 22:32:22 You’re probably not going to read the report and you’re not going to listen to an opposing view because you have have your mind made up. There is no problem, therefor we have no responsibility to curb our habits. The oil, logging and farming industries all agree with you.
1043 2018-11-28 22:32:18 Should be proper worried about this presentation tomorrow but am sitting rubbing tea tree oil on ma feet watching the holiday xoxo
1044 2018-11-28 22:32:08 Yes...Shale is in trouble...But so are the Canadian oil companies selling oil at USD 15. That is ridiculous.
1045 2018-11-28 22:32:01 @Chrysler so do ya'll suggest that you check the oil when the engine is cold or hot? I'm hearing mixed things and it's not in the manual 
1046 2018-11-28 22:31:55 For sure. I just wish he’d get in the real reality. You know, the one where he remembers doing nothing for the oil crisis and nothing for the job crisis.
1047 2018-11-28 22:31:52 Go look at NatGas on the day. Oil didn't crater until after NatGas took off higher. This is more hedge fund blowups over the NatGas/Oil pair trade.
1048 2018-11-28 22:31:51 Disregarding the rule of law, the Ten Commandments, and general acts of descent behavior is a big mistake. I thought we had all the oil we need Mr Secretary. You address it through global warming. Temps 9 d warmer will bake the Saudis. Oh, you guys don’t believe that either!
1049 2018-11-28 22:31:48 Haha. I know her
1050 2018-11-28 22:31:44 got my cars first oil change (my first with her (and ever)) filled her up and they fixed the skid guard thing so Valkyrie is GOOD TO GO and I got whataburger for my troubles we are being PRODUCTIVE today lads
1051 2018-11-28 22:31:35 They’re barely finding out that companies use motor oil as syrup and shaving cream as whipped cream in advertisement photos
1052 2018-11-28 22:31:27 Yes Barry, u worked so hard to open Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and complete Keystone XL pipeline. Oh wait...you tried to shut down American oil production and keep us dependant on foreign oil. You're full of horse sh**. ! Thanks to Trump , gas prices are down 30¢ in my area since Oct.
1053 2018-11-28 22:31:26 We have to stop this now!!! It’s ok to admit you were duped. They sold you snake oil. It’s just pride fuckin with you now!

1056 2018-11-28 22:31:00 WTI Crude continued its volatile slide lower today, down another 2.42% to $50.31 on growing reserves and reports from Saudi officials that the largest producer of oil will not cut production alone

1058 2018-11-28 22:30:46 You're only part of the way there. Offshore leasing boomed under Obama. In addition, the administration incentivized shale gas and oil development. In addition, the administration also incentivized clean energy. These are knowable facts that can be researched. #lookitup
1059 2018-11-28 22:30:45 Graham is a cow... All talk no action. The Saudis will need to give him some barrel of oil
1060 2018-11-28 22:30:44 I make my own pizza: 5 cups a/p flour
1 1/4 cup warm (110-115dg)
2 3/4 tsp yeast (active dry)
1/2 tsp salt
2 tlb sugar
1/4 cup olive oil
In stand mix w/dough hook:
place flour & salt  stir
In cup:  water yeast oil sugar : wait until yeast blooms
 mix for 5 min/ let rise/ 4 crusts
1061 2018-11-28 22:30:43 Oil production rose in spite of Obama.
1062 2018-11-28 22:30:38 Ahh to springboard off of this, the Kiehls avocado eye cream is REALLY good too! (I'm also currently buying la mer in my qwabs only). This cold snap in GA has made my oil slick skin hella dry and I hate it.But the cream really helps prevent creasing. And I'm using shape tape too.
1063 2018-11-28 22:30:34 Not as visibly. I’m not saying we can ban Saudi oil, but the government killing that journalist was beyond fucked, and Trump still has nothing bad to say. As an ex journalist, that’s what worries me.
1064 2018-11-28 22:30:34 Know why I got in the CBD oil business? Seizures. CBD oil saved my husband’s life. Once I started using it for anxiety and panic attacks, I became a believer and started helping others. Why do you take it? #502hemp #womenincannabis #Louisville #Kentuckyproud #cbdoil #kyhempisbest
1065 2018-11-28 22:30:32 “THE SQEAKY WHEEL GETS THE OIL”, right?!?  Make Noise!! I’ll do my part to make noise, but it will take work by EVERYONE to show what they are doing to Save The Earth!

Obama is responsible for the oil & gas boom every bit as much as a rooster is responsible for the sunrise...
1074 2018-11-28 22:30:09 No... He had an impossible job. He decided not to even attempt a soft landing, he pricked the bubble. Look at high yield, OIL, Lumber, global indices, emerging market bonds, homebuilders, industrial metals. This is not fixed by one dovish statement.

1078 2018-11-28 22:30:01 Not gonna lie this is me. All I know is to get an oil change and air in my tires. I messed and didn’t get a tune up. Whole radiator split. Had to get a new water pump and battery
1079 2018-11-28 22:30:00 Sweetheart the prices was low for oil because George Bush  crushed the economy.  over his presidency remained relatively low. which I don’t like one bit and because of the low gas prices everybody switched to SUVs that’s why majority of car companies are canceling regular cars
1080 2018-11-28 22:29:54 Does @byVikingr beard oil still exist? And does anyone in the UK sell it?
1081 2018-11-28 22:29:50 For years North America car makers built junk and were left behind in the dust. The same now is happening to alternate energy technologies and many other sectors. In Trump (Donny) county only steel, coal and oil rule.
1082 2018-11-28 22:29:36 Perhaps you should take a wee drive down the north shore of the Clyde. Just a bit past Helensburgh. You never know what ships you might find - maybe there's even a hidden oil field! 
1083 2018-11-28 22:29:26 Lying oil company executives who' lied deliberately about climate change threats, for at least a decade or 6 or more, ought to be fined 90% of their assets for lying to investors about climate change. Citizens' rights to clean enviroinment need to be in law. Laws must be for all.
1084 2018-11-28 22:29:23 @BarackObama sued everyone to stop oil production in the US.  What a liar 
1085 2018-11-28 22:29:20 If the palm oil farmer doesnt show up to class in 15 minutes we are legally allowed to run a train on this orangutan
1086 2018-11-28 22:29:17 They should still buy their own rail cars to ship/sell their oil don’t you think?
1087 2018-11-28 22:29:14 It's crossing my mind that the large, integrated oil companies don't mind creating a situation favourable to the bargain acquisition of upstream producers. Just saying. After all, in a very slowly sunsetting industry, consolidation is the name of the game. #cdnpoli #abpoli

1091 2018-11-28 22:28:57 Yes I am in California.. This air quality is damaging my lungs. i've been inhaling Eucalyptus oil. I need to go to the mountains
1092 2018-11-28 22:28:50 I'm not sure politicians understand that thier real opponents here are also the ones who ultimately thwarted the pipelines being built in the first place which appears to be big oil itself. Having said that it's good to see the NDP and UCP pulling in the same direction for a once
1093 2018-11-28 22:28:50 The low oil prices aren’t helping mother .
1094 2018-11-28 22:28:31 Anddd how will you explain if there is retaliation by raising oil prices or curtailing prices? Then what randy? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @ChuckGrassley @SenSchumer
1095 2018-11-28 22:28:17 Oil changed, Bills paid, boots ordered for Jon Langston, now to nap and for dinner
1096 2018-11-28 22:28:00 Who sells Wild Tree?  I need to order some garlic grapeseed oil.
1097 2018-11-28 22:27:57 When they reject you, it simply means that they don't have the capacity to handle the OIL & the POWER that's living on the inside of you. It means that they're not ready to be "unlocked" yet. B/c if they were, they would understand whose name you came in, to help set them free!
1098 2018-11-28 22:27:54 Absolutely on the Palm Oil front. Hats off to @IcelandFoods for broadcasting the issue more broadly.
1099 2018-11-28 22:27:47 Sheer butter 
Snake oil
Topical steroids 
Surgical removal
1100 2018-11-28 22:27:46 The oil money
1101 2018-11-28 22:27:43 They did — like, significantly more. And every single owner of a professional sports team is abjectly evil and bad, so the Qatari oil guys are kinda a wash for me. Better spending money on signing Mbappe than anything else they could do with it over there
1102 2018-11-28 22:27:37 i have so much olive oil in my hair right now i could fry something
1103 2018-11-28 22:27:33 1いらない
1104 2018-11-28 22:27:32 He is not. He is a well paid spokesperson for the oil industry and leads a lobbying group for ethanol.
1105 2018-11-28 22:27:28 Or you can use neem oil
1106 2018-11-28 22:27:24 あるすの1復刻終わってるの無情
1107 2018-11-28 22:27:22 My daughter got me some roller balls & the carrier oil & I've made some blends to help with aches & pains etc. Great help!!
1108 2018-11-28 22:27:19 I have no Idea....but it is really funny  how so many people would pore the oil in this new cars
1109 2018-11-28 22:27:03 Oil........
1110 2018-11-28 22:26:58 ふざけるなよ
1111 2018-11-28 22:26:56 Yeah, he was a BIG fan of America producing more oil 
1112 2018-11-28 22:26:56 My buddy used to run an Oil Change Shop and this late 40’s cougar used to roll by in her transam the stick shift was a dildo with spikes at the bottom. Ahh the good old days
1113 2018-11-28 22:26:38 Obama thinks we do not remember he was systematically shutting down all oil production in favour of the failed wind and solar methods he was pushing. Thank you President Trump for reviving an almost desimated oil industry.
1114 2018-11-28 22:26:30 Wrong. For 200m+ people ,alot of oil,religious and ethnic fault lines, Nigeria is in deep trouble.
1115 2018-11-28 22:26:27 It is sad to see the desperation to generate revenues come ahead of our responsibility to combat #climatechange. Building more infrastructure to burn more oil which generates GHG emissions which contributes to climate change is not helping. #cdnpoli #abpoli
1116 2018-11-28 22:26:22 Climate change is the economic crisis elephant in the room. Oil prices and car manufacturing will both pale by comparison. Let’s talk about what matters @CTV_PowerPlay
1117 2018-11-28 22:26:21 Maybe coconut oil? I mean that works on everything. I know a great diaper rash powder I’ll send u a picture of it. Jono used it all the time when he played football cause of chaffing.
1118 2018-11-28 22:26:18 1) the USA wants to ensure that no crude gets to tidewater unless it is via Texas 2) oil has no future. Both are true. If we had leadership & a solid plan to transition off of oil I'd be open to getting oil off Lac-Mégantic causing rails and into pipelines during that transition.

1120 2018-11-28 22:26:11 I wish I had taken cbd oil yesterday before work so I wouldn’t have gotten into an argument with the subway guy  I just really want a pretzel without things being awkward
1121 2018-11-28 22:26:10 Mix and whisk gently for 20 to 2 slices of batter into a teaspoon of olive oil in the lettuce.
1122 2018-11-28 22:26:08 Do you know why we are in the CBD oil business? Seizures.  CBD oil saved my husband’s life. I take it for anxiety and panic attacks. Why do you use it? #cbdoil #womenincannabis #Louisville #kentuckyproud
1123 2018-11-28 22:26:05 i dont agree that plastic is the least of our problems only because Ive sailed 3 of the 7 seas and seen plastic floating around in all of them. Everything we touch everyday is mad from oil/plastic. I do agree however about jet travel, but how do you force people to stop or reduce
1124 2018-11-28 22:26:03 Our Eco council are mobilised. We watched the Ran Tang video and now we want to talk to the Prime Minister about Palm oil and challenge other supermarkets to follow Iceland’s lead. We are also thinking about over farming of livestock.
1125 2018-11-28 22:25:58 Grabbed what I thought was my CBD oil in the dark but was actually my lavender essential oil and Christ like I know they're both suppose to help with sleep/anxiety or whatever but that was a close call
1126 2018-11-28 22:25:48 Oil money
1127 2018-11-28 22:25:41 I do know that, I’m just saying they can easily cause an oil glut anytime they want to. Get it.
1128 2018-11-28 22:25:40 I mean so are potatoes but latkes get a pass for being fried in oil
1129 2018-11-28 22:25:35 Sure...just as soon as the oil dries up, I’m positive that will be The US and the World’s foreign policy
1130 2018-11-28 22:25:34 Yeah my mom always used that stuff on me when I was a baby I’m also planning going with reusable wipes and making an all-natural spray solution with like castile soap, coconut and jojoba oil, and tea tree and lavender essential oils
1131 2018-11-28 22:25:26 I may have to switch from almond oil.
1132 2018-11-28 22:25:23 Ooo I think it's cause you gotta like keep at them. But it also depends on what it is. Like I feel like things for tour face or hair take time. You def need to try vitamin e oil for your hair!
1133 2018-11-28 22:25:21 The soul is not transformed into oil. The body or anything alive can be processed into oil. Oil secretes from the pores of living beings & just like a cooked pig drips of oil all things alive can be converted. I don't understand the radioactive baby part of this but I'm no expert

1136 2018-11-28 22:25:05 Maimeri is by far my favorite brand of oil paint!!!! Extremely vibrant & creamy colors. Can’t wait to buy more
1137 2018-11-28 22:25:01 Broccoli with sesame oil is my fav snack
1138 2018-11-28 22:24:59 Good share, and a critical note as Saudi Arabia continues to rapidly adjust course, as they diversify from oil so to does the strategy they’ve used for defense on historical reliance adjusting to greater self reliance, they’ll have less oil power to sway West in 20+ years.
1139 2018-11-28 22:24:56 @realDonaldTrump You feel sorry for Manafort's family for what the FBI "did to him?" Do you know who I feel sorry for? Those of us in the world (not only in America) who know how much of a snake oil salesman you are! Mostly I feel sorry for my kids, as you're destroying all...
1140 2018-11-28 22:24:44 Good to see @Jduncan21240 & @Borojaxon Getting some extra work in after school today! Quick weight gain tip from this afternoon: Add a tablespoon of Olive or Canola oil to your weight gain shake. You won't notice the taste & you just added 120 calories of primarily healthy fats!
1141 2018-11-28 22:24:41 I was upset that Michelle Desilets who claims to advocate for orangutans is more interested in the ‘economic development’ of Indonesia than conservation of remaining rainforests. She supports ‘sustainable’ palm oil & advocates that consumers should continue to use palm oil.
1142 2018-11-28 22:24:41 Okay, the FAI, ASI and IFS have all said that even if oil reaches $0,  unemployment hits 20% and the trade deficit is double what UK's is, an iScot GDP will increase by 5% and everyone will £1000 better off.  Do you support the SNP and independence?
1143 2018-11-28 22:24:30 Roasting echalion shallots with oil & chilli flakes is literally my new jam.

(Oooh get her)
1144 2018-11-28 22:24:30 I couldn’t help it..I got angry! The oil was him? The stock market was him? Ok @BarackObama what are you smoking?

1147 2018-11-28 22:23:58 So glad Obama discovered the Bakken oil fields. He spent many days digging holes until he found the right one.
1148 2018-11-28 22:23:51 "Extra virgin oil"
1149 2018-11-28 22:23:50 He did his best to not produce oil what a clown
1150 2018-11-28 22:23:47 Just because you're an oily slime ball doesn't make you responsible for America being the largest oil producer
1151 2018-11-28 22:23:46 .
He just can't help all the abusing he does!

I'd trust a silver-tongued man pulling snake oil out of a carpetbag at a carnie more than @MichaelAvenatti
1152 2018-11-28 22:23:44 Poor Barry Soetero, hes coming unglued as he watches what little legacy he had, slip away. He now thinks hes responsible for the oil boom in America! Poor thing. 
@BarackObama
#LooneyTunes
1153 2018-11-28 22:23:31 Took my car for an oil change and ended up needing a new battery, an air sensor in my tire and had to fix my exhaust... all on top of my oil change
1154 2018-11-28 22:23:28 Based on the GM announcement yesterday, I’d say you’re living in the past.  You can encourage energy production (DYK - US Oil Production increase over 70% under Obama) while looking toward future technology.  If you don’t adapt to change, you’re going to be a victim of it.
1155 2018-11-28 22:23:18 Massive, if we had oil money he’d be the first player I’d buy
1156 2018-11-28 22:23:17 The increase in oil production during Obama was attributable to the Oil shale boom that started about the time he took office. Not because anything he did. That is a fact. 
You can’t champion that you’re a green energy Prez and then the next day take credit for booming oil prod.
1157 2018-11-28 22:23:15 Take cod liver oil every day, you won’t get sick at all 
1158 2018-11-28 22:23:12 I keep a bottle of peppermint oil on my desk. Good for deconsgesting, plus it helps with memory and focus. I need a LOT of help with focus lately.
1159 2018-11-28 22:23:11 And you are welcome for the low oil prices.
1160 2018-11-28 22:23:10 #LaGrandeExplication La réunion est un département français, donc avec les même taxes qu'en Auvergne alors pouvez vous m'expliquer pourquoi le gas oil est a 1€20 ??
1161 2018-11-28 22:23:08 Bold claim: Shorting Oil and going long on Bitcoin is bold....and smart.
1162 2018-11-28 22:23:04 NOT our ally. But that oil, tho
1163 2018-11-28 22:23:04 He’s a joke. Oil and gas production went up under him despite his best efforts to curtail them. He forgot he sunk Keystone XL
1164 2018-11-28 22:23:04 You and your greedy supporters can’t have it both ways @jkenney. Funny that when oil is $100/bbl, government should get out of the way and let “industry” run things, as they “know best” but when faced with crisis, it’s up to government to save the day.
1165 2018-11-28 22:22:55 Canadians probably figured out that it's Texas oil oligarchs, Saud mob, Russia and other foreign dark money secretly trying to mess up Canadian energy. So I presume Canadians must have figured that out.
1166 2018-11-28 22:22:49 Filthy oil money gross
1167 2018-11-28 22:22:47 Castor oil
1168 2018-11-28 22:22:41 Does it mention that China has passed us up like we're standing still because of official climate change denial and big oil interference?
1169 2018-11-28 22:22:40 God works in miraculous ways remember the woman of oil 
1170 2018-11-28 22:22:27 Epsom salts baths or spray magnesium oil on your legs. I buy Epsom salts in 20 kg bags online - stupid expensive in most chemists. You need at least two cupfuls in bath and need to stay in a minimum of 12 minutes for full efficacy!
1171 2018-11-28 22:22:13 This one seems the most important for any field and is still hard for me today(yearly performance reviews at oil comp require us to do the same). Don’t tell me how you did XYZ, tell me the value you added by doing XYZ (saved a load of money, made a process more efficient,etc)
1172 2018-11-28 22:22:05 Hope we r not amazed at gas prices going down. $J has been appreciating against USD & global oil prices dipped blow US $50
 It will go up back soon. Early Xmas present. Enjoy!
1173 2018-11-28 22:21:58 Burned some midnight oil for that but it's coming along nicely.
1174 2018-11-28 22:21:50 OIL has its hand up his ass and moves his mouth
1175 2018-11-28 22:21:30 @am640oakley weakass snark re Alberta 'oil' crisis mr Oakley. Uninformed shallow generalizing of Harper era catch phrases. If its so damn critical to Canada's Economy, how can you wank that dilbit is 'oil', abuse misguided ms Notely & pimp Jason Kenney as our pipeline saviour?
1176 2018-11-28 22:21:28 Yes, we do. He thinks he’s responsible for oil prices and his fans believe him, he doesn’t live in a reality, he lives in Obama’s world, he built it all.
1177 2018-11-28 22:21:25 Am I hallucinating?
Did I just see Obama say he had no scandals in his administration?  Did I hear him say the oil boom is because of him?
Bwahahaha
1178 2018-11-28 22:21:23 PSG fans deserve a team that doesn't fucking whinge every few seconds. They deserve a team with passion and soul, but you'll never get that with oil money. Hope they fail
1179 2018-11-28 22:21:20 A direct result of this country's inability to complete new ppln capacity. Oil by rail will continue to grow and is very profitable for those moving product into Northern USA where the WCS/WTI differential yields a nice payday.
1180 2018-11-28 22:21:18 pos o tried to halt oil production in favor his good friends saudi.
1181 2018-11-28 22:21:14 Yasjay e don pass now u should av sorted it out by now..... but what do i know Lemmi keep shut
1182 2018-11-28 22:21:11 My political leaning is wanting to scream "That's the fucking problem" whenever someone vomit out "But our society needs oil and gas to operate".
1183 2018-11-28 22:21:00 Cooking oil? hehe
1184 2018-11-28 22:20:45 of course i like cheap gas, but my dad works in the oil field and this is scaring me if im bein honest
1185 2018-11-28 22:20:41 Even Bath House Barry knows it even though he is trying to take credit for it like everything else. You could improve your reputation on twitter by 1000% if you would check before you tweet

Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was me people . say thank you.
1186 2018-11-28 22:20:33 Oil
1187 2018-11-28 22:20:28 Just put this on a loop & wanking Mr French off while he watches it. Might need more baby oil.

1190 2018-11-28 22:20:04 Lolllll cannabis oil contains zero thc and is used for medicinal reasons?
1191 2018-11-28 22:20:03 FG mulls fingerprint technology to tackle oil theft
1192 2018-11-28 22:19:55 Too big for me on not is not the topic here, the topic is the economic effect of having a 500% increase of salary in a present economic situation. Oil don’t have that more power in the market again, diversification of the economy will not happen under 1 year, how do we survive?
1193 2018-11-28 22:19:55 Terrific comment of yours, Obama’s Legacy is in his own mind, I love it.  And now he claims our oil production is thanks to him...such an ego maniac.
1194 2018-11-28 22:19:49 Cutting oil production is a no brainer. Why would anyone sell oil at a loss?
1195 2018-11-28 22:19:40 Next up, his bill to put an oil rig at the base of Delicate Arch.
1196 2018-11-28 22:19:37 Things are going extremely downhill in my life ! Yet I feel a sense of peace ! Not sure if things are gonna be okay or if the cbd oil just kicked in
1197 2018-11-28 22:19:37 Can't pay for it with today's #oil #wti #brent prices. @OPEC
1198 2018-11-28 22:19:31 What about climate change? BP oil spill? Absolutely asinine, we don't live in separate bubbles.
1199 2018-11-28 22:19:27 Scary that he is still at the helm of the Oilers with a thought process like that...I hope the next GM can figure it out.....
1200 2018-11-28 22:19:27 Obama doesnt know crude oil is Fossil fuel!
1201 2018-11-28 22:19:26 @lucybeecoconut how do you recommend to take the vegan omega oil? Love the taste but gives me heart burn sensation. #ideas #lucybee
1202 2018-11-28 22:19:25 Today in my last ochem lab we are making biodiesel out of coconut oil and I am deathly allergic to coconut oil :)) pray for me
1203 2018-11-28 22:19:25 Finally had the chance to get my tires checked, get an oil change, pump gas & go to Walmart to buy some stuff I needed... y’all, I never been so relieved & happy. Lmao
1204 2018-11-28 22:19:20 The rationale for supply management is that some form of market failure caused oil producers to over-invest in production. I’m not convinced this problem has been established. Nor am I convinced that it would benefit Alberta.
1205 2018-11-28 22:19:15 Here is a idea for baby J.... let’s turn the Oshawa GM plant into a refinery... then build a pipeline from Alberta to Ontario and the east can eliminate Saudi oil!   Helps Both provinces out of some difficult times!  And creates how many jobs?
1206 2018-11-28 22:19:08 Obama cannot site as single policy decision that he implemented that benefited the stock market or oil growing under his presidency -The growth came from the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates and the private market investing in  oil
1207 2018-11-28 22:18:57 The only large oil production for Obama was the massive spill in the gulf of mexico. 2010, BP oil explosion!!!
1208 2018-11-28 22:18:57 oh!イル
1209 2018-11-28 22:18:54 ...The burgeoning population that we have to feed? Those growing numbers have to have jobs which means oil use....
1210 2018-11-28 22:18:50 My #Bears license plate got me 25% off my oil change. #Winning #DaBears
1211 2018-11-28 22:18:44 QUESTION OF THE DAY: Which is the greater economic crisis facing Canada today: The Alberta oil price crash at U.S. refineries, or the end of the road for General Motors in Oshawa?
1212 2018-11-28 22:18:44 Only if you replace the majority of cars, trucks, and planeson the road or in the air with an electrical version, then yes that would drive demand and price of oil. But that will take a really long time.
1213 2018-11-28 22:18:37 the five for Jedediah you are lovely and I really would like you to share your complexion oil specifically with me because I am old and dry and maybe it will help me.  Thank you so/tk
1214 2018-11-28 22:18:35 Fracking.. yea its how they collect the oil in shale formations
1215 2018-11-28 22:18:30 trump, gop, oil, nra, russia, mbs, money first. People last.
1216 2018-11-28 22:18:27 It is so funny Obama claims low oil price is because of him what a joke I worked 37 years in the oil field and most of the time I got stuck unemployed was when barrack was president he sucked as President but I didn’t run him down about his terrible job he did
1217 2018-11-28 22:18:26 Away from the desk the whole day (much needed) - catching up now, got to say this negative #oil tape is very ominous...
1218 2018-11-28 22:18:25 I swear ..
1219 2018-11-28 22:18:08 Amazing what money, sorry, oil can do.
1220 2018-11-28 22:18:03 Another genius who believes that Doug is responsible for world-wide oil price drop.
1221 2018-11-28 22:18:01 me: h-
y’all: bitch we all know that’s shaving cream and motor oil
1222 2018-11-28 22:17:51 Many of us in BC who support the pipelines and that is more than oppose, really are getting tired of her mouth and Kenny's too, they need to stfu and maybe learn to take some responsibility along with the oil companies for a change
1223 2018-11-28 22:17:49 To the hot guy that did my oil change for me: 

Yes I really am a dumb bitch. But I could be your dumb bitch
1224 2018-11-28 22:17:47 For those that don't believe in the deepstate. Last night the Bush Wing of the @GOP invited Obama to speak at the James A. Baker Political Institute at Rice University (notice the Illuminati owl symbol) While here he took credit for the success of get this Oil Drilling in the US!
1225 2018-11-28 22:17:40 I was born there, lived there twice in my life & have family members living there so by your logic I feel I am qualified to weigh in. The blockade isn't killing the oil industry - new energy technologies are, so please stop w/this updated version of "Let them freeze in the dark".
1226 2018-11-28 22:17:39 As Secretary of State it's his duty to listen what happened to an American. Were the people who tortured Khashoggi laughing? Khashoggi spoke English. We don't need Saudi oil or jobs. @realDonaldTrump
1227 2018-11-28 22:17:39 So the guy taking care of my oil change is someone I took care of at mellow last week. I remember he tipped me 5 on 74  but he just took 25% off and added a 20$ coupon for me so we’re cool now.
1228 2018-11-28 22:17:38 I half regret spending my money on mang inasal last night. PUTA DLI SIYA WORTH IT WALA SILAY CHICKEN OIL BLAND KAAYO ANG AKONG KAON KAGABIE. But still nabusog man sad ko, so okay nasad.
1229 2018-11-28 22:17:37 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for dry brushing, and put some spiced chai essential oil in my diffuser.
1230 2018-11-28 22:17:36 @BarackObama you are sooooo pathetic - trying to take credit for all of Trump's successes - come on step up take credit for the job killing environmental issues - that oil would never have made it out of all the Country
1231 2018-11-28 22:17:22 Exactly. All of Obama's 8 years I worked at oil companies he did everything he could do to hault oil production. Jim talking credit was just laughable.
1232 2018-11-28 22:17:17 You should try CBD oil doesn’t necessarily have to have thc that’s what I’ve used to help me for sleep, pain, anxiety etc. There’s many brands out there you can get online as well
1233 2018-11-28 22:17:17 We know Palm oil is red... Abi is there Green Palm oil???
1234 2018-11-28 22:17:16 Seeing @jkenney and @RachelNotley on @CTV_PowerPlay trynna show off who loves the oil industry more. Like rats fighting in a ditch over some piss.
1235 2018-11-28 22:17:15 "Russian Invasion" didn't happen in 2016. We were pro Putin before 9/11 even more so after. Follow the  Russia & US have been in a perpetual war in oil rich countries. Saudi's gave us perfect EXCUSE for war? Again? We "saved" them, then we excused them?
1236 2018-11-28 22:17:11 Thank you to the @Oil_Foundation for their generosity in funding bursaries for learners and capital for the hospitality lab @NorQuest! #EOCFHIParty #yegdt
1237 2018-11-28 22:17:10 Good man, yep Kierran is a great fella and one of the boys  always got a good giggle and by ek he can spot a oil leak from 100 yards n choke rubber chickens, need I say more
1238 2018-11-28 22:17:07 That is correct.  History of the Earth show changes in climates & weather in regions. Archeologists find info in their digs.          Gore & his snake oil crowd are indeed grifters & scam artists.

1241 2018-11-28 22:17:00 I honestly rarely eat salt, it’s probably the oil in the food I eat and also I used to eat like a dozen eggs a day . That only worked though cause I’d average 15-20 miles of running a week haha, I haven’t ran much since my ankle injury though
1242 2018-11-28 22:17:00 Should’ve condemned them instead of rolling over, taking their apology money and cheap oil prices as retribution and than brag about it like 45 did.
1243 2018-11-28 22:16:43 At least be honest and call it what it is: fossil fuel industry. The possible benefit? Oh just reducing climate change, and becoming more energy self-sufficient by using #renewables.

Tell me: what do you propose to sell when the oil runs out?
1244 2018-11-28 22:16:37 @ScottRhodie its going to be another shit day decided to  varnish and oil  the wood in my house im really  blessed with a magical carpenter but I need to protect the wood There's  outdoor wood as well hope i can do it all  before  the  new year

1247 2018-11-28 22:16:17 Our hydrostat blew because we ‘forgot” to change the oil for 3000 hrs.  That was a career ending mistake!!
1248 2018-11-28 22:16:04 Oh and MCT oil in my coffee or protein shake helped so much!
1249 2018-11-28 22:16:04 have you tried scrambling the eggs in a good quality unfiltered olive oil?

1254 2018-11-28 22:15:36 How ironic~after his policies while in office actually drove US drilling rigs away from the Gulf of Mexico & had to be re-located off African coast~he decimated US oil production while in office~just another one of his huge lies
1255 2018-11-28 22:15:35 add some oil veterans too
1256 2018-11-28 22:15:29 Can someone take my car for an oil change please
1257 2018-11-28 22:15:29 Is that called fracking? Hate to sound ignorant/but I really don’t know? it’s (fracking) for shale rock to turn into oil?been going on in PA for a while now
1258 2018-11-28 22:15:26 Its amazing one man can take credit for reducing carbon emmissions(Paris Accord) while being responsible for oil production increases. And while engineering a recovery also be taxing you into poverty. More people on welfare and food stamps during his so called recovery. Hilarious
1259 2018-11-28 22:15:19 Unfortunately, Doing the Unthinkable is the mission statement of oil and gas politician on the planet
1260 2018-11-28 22:15:15 If I don’t change my oil this weekend I give someone permission to punch me
1261 2018-11-28 22:15:09 Can you explain why they are our ally? It doesn't make any sense. We're nearly 20 years from they supplied all the 9/11 terrorists and we still have to fuck with them. I thought Obama said we make our own oil now.
1262 2018-11-28 22:15:06 "a choice"  sounds just like the excuses mlm leaders use after they screw their downlines out of thousands.. " it was your choice to join" .. snake oil salesmen talk .. its a scam model not a buisness model ...
1263 2018-11-28 22:15:04 King narcissist never disappoints....if it would have been up to him fracking wouldn't exist and we'd still be dependent on the middle east for oil....take your "you didn't build that" bullshit and shove it!
1264 2018-11-28 22:14:50 Thanks, Colin. I sent these leadership quotes to my four sons. Two Naval officers, one very successful in oil field sales, and one Retired, disabled, after a free flight from being strapped in a Humvee when an IED hit his door. Now at Homeland Security. They will all benefit.
1265 2018-11-28 22:14:50 Yeah the best part about oil is everyone paying subsidies to the largest most profitable companies in the world. 

The real problem is some electric car grants.
1266 2018-11-28 22:14:43 Good documentary that. He was the first one I heard speaking about palm oil, it’s so nice that the words getting out there.

1269 2018-11-28 22:14:28 GFY Obama. The only thing you did was not get in the way of the oil industry too much. WOW CONGRATULATIONS YOU DID IT!
1270 2018-11-28 22:14:19 oh i thought you were about to say since they got that oil money
1271 2018-11-28 22:14:15 Put coconut oil in my hair earlier with the plan of washing it out then me and Ryan napped.. I'm definitely going to work with coconut oil in my hair tomorrow 
1272 2018-11-28 22:14:13 Obama has to be back on Cocaine to believe he made America a oil producing country. Obama wouldn't okay the Pipeline and shut down Coal.

At least, oil sector make lower high potentially,

1283 2018-11-28 22:13:11 He tried to lie and suggest that simply because he is somewhat diversified by having one or two green investments, that the bulk of his financial gain doesn’t come from big oil. I see through him. Chris pretends he doesn’t.

1296 2018-11-28 22:12:21 Maybe MsNotley,should use her time to force Oil/gas companies to deal with&clean up All their spills&deal with& properly close the abandoned wells.

1297 2018-11-28 22:12:19 Would be swayed by a snake oil salesman who sells bullshit and lies is laughable.
1298 2018-11-28 22:12:04 Thought they cancelled the snake oil show, due to poor ticket sales..
1299 2018-11-28 22:11:51 Cheap Oil is the new ZIRP.
HFT is the mechanism to make both happen.
1300 2018-11-28 22:11:47 Do you know we import 40% of our oil from Canada? Then Mexico, SA, Turkey etc...

We are not even close to oil self sufficient.

We produce lots of natural gas, the supply we have would last 100 years at current rates.
1301 2018-11-28 22:11:40 I  these feel-good stories!
1302 2018-11-28 22:11:34 The huge contributions of tax dollars from oil that the Feds collect are important to the entire country. 
Alberta has been treated very poorly.
1303 2018-11-28 22:11:29 At the rate we are consuming oil, we will have completely depleted the oil reserves on earth in 60 years (~2078). As a species we have already used up 50% of the oil on Earth (We have used up ~42 trillion gallons of oil and there is about that much left for the next 60 YEARS)
1304 2018-11-28 22:11:24 A carbon tax on every one except the largest producer of carbon the US military and NASA. A carbon tax for something you are almost forced to buy as oil and gas companies area fascist monopoly that don’t allow the best solutions in the market through suppressed patents
1305 2018-11-28 22:11:22 You think we are that stupid  that we would allow  hundreds of thousands of people to die just so we can get oil money. Your removing all of the subtext and details of what actually happened. And just saying oil from money corporation is evil. US bad and you are a St.

1307 2018-11-28 22:11:14 the province has almost 2,400 producing oil and gas wells where are they on the map ? I am sure many will be surprised to know there are 2,385 producing oil and natural gas wells in Ontario in 2017
1308 2018-11-28 22:11:07 Obama Hussain is a lousy school teacher who was stupid when defending America and a major racist. All he talked about was blacks, whites, Christians, Muslim he praised, Couldn’t run a lawnmower business, change the oil in his car couldn’t fish or hunt. A sad punk

1321 2018-11-28 22:09:54 i saw the post. unless there is a some sort of soul sucking tech that can extract and transform a soul into oil, like energon cubes or something, I am not seeing how the "matrix" power plant can work. oil is an high pressure hydrocarbon process, no? doesn't require babies.
1322 2018-11-28 22:09:52 I wish I had a $1 for every time someone bought equipment on the internet & forgot to put oil in it #Iwouldberich
1323 2018-11-28 22:09:52 Oil production in Texas & Alaska are rolling hard right now. That’s a very good thing.
1324 2018-11-28 22:09:36 Tea tree oil was too strong, but I’ve started using aloe Vera about a month ago and it’s helped. I’m gonna give it more time
1325 2018-11-28 22:09:22 All This Donald Trump Shit has lost many of your focus on what is happening behind the scenes. Bear Ears and Grand Escalante aland is being sold to drill for oil and other minerals. He also took the Mashee Wampanoags land and Recognition away. Pay attention!
1326 2018-11-28 22:09:10 You’re right it isn’t, but this is one of the best ways to tackle deforestation. Once it affects profits/perception companies will be forced to find other ways of getting palm oil in a better way
1327 2018-11-28 22:09:10 Definitely leaking oil. After holding up through the canna carnage so well, it appears the drip selling is winning out.
1328 2018-11-28 22:09:08 Apportionment works.
I was crude nominations manager for a large US / Canadian oil producer until my retirement. I managed shipments for my company throughout western Canada. If you want higher price, you cut production. And pipeline capacity holds you to amount you can produce.
1329 2018-11-28 22:09:05 Auto and oil and gas industry advocate De Blasio strikes again!   He’s a wanna-be Republican and loves the pollution and congestion caused by automobiles.  He wants more NYs in cars, stuck in traffic.
1330 2018-11-28 22:09:04 You mean the war that Trump continued and refused to end because of oil $$?
1331 2018-11-28 22:09:02 Did you not get the anti spurs media email Mathew? In all honesty we need to be more patient, the good times are coming and will last far longer than the boom and bust of some of the oil rich clubs.
1332 2018-11-28 22:09:02 Even from the condensate diluent production side there would be some significant issues trying to run compression and process trains far under design. I think many people think it’s just a valve you open and close and oil comes out.
1333 2018-11-28 22:08:59 Oil changed twice this month lol mad miles put in
1334 2018-11-28 22:08:54 Does he lobby for Big Oil?
1335 2018-11-28 22:08:52 Obama wanted to put up inefficient Windmills and solar on every street corner. Most Drilling was considered criminal under his administration. He shut down/denied countless permits and was against all oil and now he’s trying to take credit for Trump’s huge oil success? PATHETIC.
1336 2018-11-28 22:08:46 And has canola oil that causes brain lesions. 

Canola is NOT cheaper than BETTER and SAFER oils!
1337 2018-11-28 22:08:41 I’m always scared that I’m gonna get ripped off while going to the mechanic. And every time I go in for a $20 oil change and leave paying $700 for some other bs that’s wrong with my car 
1338 2018-11-28 22:08:40 Pool not oil LOL
1339 2018-11-28 22:08:35 And has canola oil that causes brain lesions.

1341 2018-11-28 22:08:29 I've been thinking what's next to work on - palm oil, easier to understand sugar etc, and I think that's a very good suggestion.
1342 2018-11-28 22:08:27 In 2006, after 35 years of declining production, oil production climbed to 13 million barrels per day....

Sorry not obama either..
1343 2018-11-28 22:08:21 And has canola oil that causes brain lesions. 

Canola is NOT cheaper than BETTER and SAFER oils!
1344 2018-11-28 22:08:19 I wonder how many times he referred to himself in that interview.  Now I hear he's taking credit for the oil independence that our country is now experiencing.  If memory serves, didn't he kill two pipeline bills that Pres. Trump released?  what a joke Obama is.
1345 2018-11-28 22:08:17 GM is managing a bad bet that higher oil prices would steer consumers into buying small vehicles. That didn't happen so they're adjusting accordingly. To think they would behave otherwise because they got a huge tax cut is pure folly. We've been here a million times before.
1346 2018-11-28 22:08:11 It's where you get on someone's shoulders in the oil and some one else gets on someone else's shoulders and you try and pull or push the other person into the water lol
1347 2018-11-28 22:08:09 #UKOG have other assets, PDEL 234 is 3 times the size of HH and 100% owned & IoW has 4x more recoverable oil then HH. Not intended to be a like for like valuation just to give a feel for recent buy out value. With cheap recovery costs I would say UKOG will be worth a lot more tbh
1348 2018-11-28 22:08:01 You hypocrite.  You fought against opening the oil fields in Alaska when it was proven no environmental danger then opposed the pipeline that would facilitate the movement of oil from Canada to the refineries.
1349 2018-11-28 22:08:00 There are a couple of processes that used waste from a turkey processor to create a form of crude oil suitable for existing refineries. The point is, liquid fuels have a much higher energy density and an existing infrastructure. I'm not sure they're goung to disappear soon.
1350 2018-11-28 22:07:55 This is just oil chart upside down. Since gold relative volatility lower, If you take gold away and just reverse oil, chart would look nearly the same.
1351 2018-11-28 22:07:47 The fact remains that people in the Blue Zones consume large quantities of olive oil and reliably live into their 90s and beyond. So at the very least olive oil isn’t doing them much harm.
1352 2018-11-28 22:07:37 Lol me too I was looking for the oil that starts with an E,
I can’t spell it right now lol but I got lavender at home
1353 2018-11-28 22:07:35 Thats a lie Spain will accept us with open arms. Do keep up with the real news. Anyway must go to bed as i work in the oil Ind and one must keep the oil flowing to keep Englands \Elite in comfort.
1354 2018-11-28 22:07:34 any body noticed , "why has diesel and Petrol prices just gone so far apart now petrol is 10p per litre less than diesel .
Why is it so high when the Oil price per barrel is just over $50
we paid 135 when it was high at 98$ per barrel .
 rip of Britain or Tory tax collector
1355 2018-11-28 22:07:27 Canola oil in it causes brain lesions.

Maybe that's why I can't find Imagine Organic on twitter...
1356 2018-11-28 22:07:20 Tories dont give a damn about SCOTLAND This country is just a Oil Revenue Money Tree  and that is all
Dont Like It?
Independence is the way out of the Precious Bullshit Union
1357 2018-11-28 22:07:19 Just make sure you keep introducing him as a paid lobbyist for big oil
1358 2018-11-28 22:07:12 It took him over a month to even call the CEO of BP after the spill. He weaponized the EPA against everyone, especially Oil and Gas Companies. Any advances by the O&G Industry was despite him, not because of him. 
Sad the people that believe every word he says. What a lying phony
1359 2018-11-28 22:07:07 A little late. They stood back for years as forign oil countries bought off his fellow people to stop Canadian oil from getting to market
1360 2018-11-28 22:07:07 like, Big Oil's got the indoctrination & fear-mongering down pat
1361 2018-11-28 22:07:04 Did he allow drilling in Anwar? No. Allow the Dakota pipeline? No
Did he restrict frill my in the Gulf? Yes. Does Obama deserve credit for oil production at #1? No. He lies.
1362 2018-11-28 22:07:02 hence the higher cost-per-head of things like public services, or the higher costs in extracting oil from the sea vs extracting oil from the desert/land.
1363 2018-11-28 22:06:59 You missed Chelsea another oil fc team.
Without oil still shit small clubs.
1364 2018-11-28 22:06:55 Can’t tell is this cbd oil actually calmed my anxiety or not
1365 2018-11-28 22:06:45 sometimes i wonder when white people will stop riding Big Oil's dick
1366 2018-11-28 22:06:42 I overheard my lil sister talking about her intensive skincare routine....I watched her cook a slither of bacon in 3 inches of oil the other day. I..........cannuh.
1367 2018-11-28 22:06:29 Securing 100% of oil revenues after independence - rather than the current "crumbs from the table"  situation - will inevitably make Scotland better off. Alternatively, Brexit will make all Scots worse off.
1368 2018-11-28 22:06:02 Consuming, putting coconut oil on my skin and eating Black Chia Biscuits everyday, I’m out in the sun at work and at home in the garden quite a few hours a day, I do not get burn and my skin is smooth as..
1369 2018-11-28 22:05:56 I had pancakes today because they looked so good on the menu. I can’t believe I was drooling over motor oil. 
1370 2018-11-28 22:05:53 Powell essentially acknowledges the economy/inflation isn't as strong as they thought... 2sVs10s barely moved, about 25 bps spread. Oil crashed to lower closing lows $USO now -34% and everyone shrugs. What a strange day! What is the hope here? He didn't say stop in December...
1371 2018-11-28 22:05:46 Some of ya'll be defending pindicks with that "motion in the ocean" bs till you got one of us Carribbean boys dancin with a  oil tanker inside ya holes....
1372 2018-11-28 22:05:36 Gotta love that arab oil money 
1373 2018-11-28 22:05:27 In which reality does one live where the boom in oil & gas is due to Obama?
1374 2018-11-28 22:05:25 I’m not ‘bad at cooking’, it’s just that I chop super slowly and I get scared when oil spits at me so I cook everything on a low temperature... 

Some people might even say that I’m a great chef, because I take so much more time to prepare the food than the average chef does 
1375 2018-11-28 22:05:22 Low key do need my oil in my changed but I got like
1376 2018-11-28 22:05:20 I love how easy it is to ignore the foundations he laid for trump to build upon? 

Fracking became unviable because of low oil prices. 

He & the Fed’s decision re policy and QE was a huge factor behind the rise in stock prices - and the general economy improving as a whole.
1377 2018-11-28 22:05:19 Love getting an oil change and they start telling me what else is wrong with the car lol no I’m not buying anything else just put it back
1378 2018-11-28 22:05:11 Shouldn't oil companies be sucking up to the Alberta government, begging the public for the privilege to mine the public's resources?

Pretty sure we're doing it wrong.

@Norm_Farrell #abpoli #cdnpoli
1379 2018-11-28 22:05:07 A: what's good for middle east stability is good for oil, which is good for America.
B: Israeli lobby is powerful
..... You pick.
1380 2018-11-28 22:05:07 Mr O    Ass lube is not considered oil.
1381 2018-11-28 22:05:06 Nut the 14 dollar a barrel oil!? It can't be, sumbudy halp usssss
1382 2018-11-28 22:05:00 In 2018  US broke a 47 year record for oil production and net imports are at a 60 year low....   let me guess that was obama?
1383 2018-11-28 22:04:58 I am not going to go through all of the spending plans, so I will kjeep it simple.

Can you explain to me how far poorer per capita industrialized countries have a found a way to do these things?

Nobody is calling for an immediate switch from gas and oil... that's not possible.
1384 2018-11-28 22:04:57 lathering it up with coconut oil :(
1385 2018-11-28 22:04:46 If you’re not putting motor oil on your pancakes please grow up.
1386 2018-11-28 22:04:43 Obama: There seems to be a misunderstanding folks. I mean, I was a great president, I, I, I am the one that made us the biggest oil producer, I, I, I am the one that gave you this great economy. If you only remember one thing, please, remember, I am great.
1387 2018-11-28 22:04:35 Have you read GERS? Revenue inc oil was £60bn. Devolved expenditure about £42bn. Other expenditure, mainly pensions and benefits, another £29bn or so. Net gain to Scotland of about £10bn.
1388 2018-11-28 22:04:34 If you like your oil, you can keep your oil.
1389 2018-11-28 22:04:33 Made vegan cookies that are double coconut (flakes and oil) and they are so good zomg
1390 2018-11-28 22:04:29 America is an oil and gas company with an army and navy.
They hate competition. 
Libya, Syria, Iraq, Venezuela are knocked out.
The last independent oil suppliers are Russia, Iran and Sudan. Thats why the fuzz is about them. SaudiArabia, Qatar, Indonesia are all in the US pocket.
1391 2018-11-28 22:04:26 突然失礼します。このイベントは福岡ですよね？？台湾人アーティスト友人が福岡の良いイベント探してて紹介したいと思っております。
1392 2018-11-28 22:04:24 I suggest coconut oil. If you want to go back in time use “extra virgin”
1393 2018-11-28 22:04:23 - Speed up the migration to pipeline oil and gas transportation system 
- Automat internal petroleum supply chain and internal distribution
TO AVOID  "Human errors"

In the mean time, strengthen  border control on contraband of government subsidised petroleum.
Commonsense!
1394 2018-11-28 22:04:20 Oh for the cereal bars I don’t even oil the pan. When it’s cold, the marshmallows lose most of their stickiness and pop right out
1395 2018-11-28 22:04:07 When was tooth extracted? 

If you get more pain after 2 days get back to dentists & they will put a dressing soaked in clove oil inside the socket. 

Relief within 10 mins
1396 2018-11-28 22:04:05 Inflation will not go down because oil prices are dropping. Inflation always EXCLUDES food and fuel. This exclusion is a peeve of mine. We buy food and fuel regularly. Washing machines and cars much less often. @BullsBearsFBN
1397 2018-11-28 22:04:04 Cheating oil football destroying fuckheads
1398 2018-11-28 22:03:58 VVD had a poor game, Lovren wasn't cut out for this game and Henderson needs to be cut out of the first 11 full stop, pathetic performance. PSG (for all the oil money), their players showed heart, fight and desire. Milner, Gini, Bobby were all so poor too
1399 2018-11-28 22:03:54 oscar has oil shipment, toys and clothing
shah has oil shipment and cigar and toys ! 
I had  jackets boot,  toys,  jeans ,  sports,  appeal army gear the fake, and the real  ,  hoods ,  glassware ,  soap  house ,  supplies , gold supplies  more
1400 2018-11-28 22:03:50 Plus the welfare for the soybean farmers and and oil companies and <1%ers and on and on
#FBR
1401 2018-11-28 22:03:43 Canadian refineries should be using Canadian oil.  Let's stop importing foreign oil.  Pipelines are required to the east and west coast to access markets and replace the imported oil.

More Canadian oil = more Canadian tax dollars for services and infrastructure
1402 2018-11-28 22:03:40 Obama is truly delusional. Remember? "How is he going to do that", or "we need to get used to lower GDP"? Yet when Trump raises GDP to 4.2% &has a "magic wand" to create thousands of manufacturing jobs, he claims its all bc of him. He also blocked all attempts to drill for oil.
1403 2018-11-28 22:03:36 your wcw swears by coconut oil because a beauty guru told her to
1404 2018-11-28 22:03:15 E no press today at all. Oil ti short
1405 2018-11-28 22:03:08 Ref was bought and paid for. Oil money at it again.
1406 2018-11-28 22:03:01 This is an oil and gas lobbying group.
1407 2018-11-28 22:02:57 I notice there is a donate link...... Where can I buy your cure all snake oil? Oh wait..... oil bad? Snake juice then....
1408 2018-11-28 22:02:54 I own one lol you just need an oil and makeup wipe and trust after its been on ya lips all day it breaks down making it easier to remove. Still recommend it tho!
1409 2018-11-28 22:02:53 @kts_oil thanks for following
1410 2018-11-28 22:02:47 Beto's oil funding is not optimal but not unexpected considering TX. KH is more troublesome.
1411 2018-11-28 22:02:41 He’s gonna give auto workers as much as he’s given oil workers. Squat!
1412 2018-11-28 22:02:35 By the way, it’s the good suntan lotion. Like Hawaiian Tropics suntan frying oil. A perfectly decent smell to like! 

Some people like to smell gasoline, go shame them.
1413 2018-11-28 22:02:32 not calling oil bottom as saudis are insane and president putin is a psychopath but if oil starts forming base and starts rallying early next yr further enhances theory that investors want tangible things because of stagnation.
1414 2018-11-28 22:02:29 PSG celebrating their win against Liverpool as if they have won the UEFA Champions League final already.
It seems the Arab Oil magnate already promised them huge bonuses if they win Liverpool
#PSGLIV
1415 2018-11-28 22:02:26 Oil cut.... Funding Secured
1416 2018-11-28 22:02:23 With low Oil revenue, @MBuhari is taking on massive projects and programs. Increasing @PoliceNG salaries is simply amazing
1417 2018-11-28 22:02:18 It's okay those cheating diving fucking pricks and their fucking Qatari oil paid ref can get fucked, while we always have to do it the hard way, that's what this football club does. Good luck to Napoli at Anfield they're going to need it. #PSGLFC
1418 2018-11-28 22:02:10 Cy was covered in burnt wood and ashes, her artificial skin was burnt and oil was oozing out like blood. She was ether switched off or broken. Seems like she managed to get the door down but failed to even get in the room
1419 2018-11-28 22:02:06 Looks like it was leaking oil in the first few seconds of the clip. Upholding a great British tradtion of leaking oil in our motorbikes, cars and aeroplanes! 
1420 2018-11-28 22:01:54 One that would mean that 253 million cars that are on us roads would need to be junked and replaced with an electric car, definitely not happening overnight. That’s a 30 year project. Much faster to pump more oil to drive price down
1421 2018-11-28 22:01:43 You are so full of it!  You did EVERYTHING you could to hamper oil development. 
1422 2018-11-28 22:01:37 .. esp. as CBs may look past the sharp sell-off in oil as transitory (if it does not persist) and I can see participants developing a narrative that the Fed is slowing down its pace of hikes so the ECB and other global CBs can tighten (even if the Powell Put isn't explicit)
1423 2018-11-28 22:01:36 Another politician taking Big oil money that's killing this 
1424 2018-11-28 22:01:36 Former Sen. Jim Webb says technological advances in offshore oil/gas drilling are comparable to advances between '80s-era phones and the iPhone.
1425 2018-11-28 22:01:28 Obama will need some oil for were he his going he will be known as the first black corrupt presidential shoe shiner in U.S history
1426 2018-11-28 22:01:26 I was going to order my Fish Oil from Amazon but was warned that in California where fires broke out, it may be unsafe!
1427 2018-11-28 22:01:20 You problem here is that the UK government taxes profits. A Scottish government could/should charge a fixed tax per barrel which wouldn’t be affected by oil prices.
1428 2018-11-28 22:01:11 Fun Fact: Sodexo, our concessions partner, has an oil recycling system that allows them to use frying oil three times before recycling it for good. Thank you @SodexoGroup #OurLocalPartners
1429 2018-11-28 22:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but American citizens.
1430 2018-11-28 22:01:06 Not sure what is worse his smugness or his credit hogging for the shale revolution.  I forget what law lecturer told us repeatedly that we only had 4% of oil reserves and drill baby drill wouldn't work
1431 2018-11-28 22:01:00 I guess even refs love that oil money.
1432 2018-11-28 22:00:59 Snake Oil Salesman got to them. When you are on the side of the road and need air in your tires you will put air in them.

HAZARD Oil spill
Started today 8:03am, last checked today 8:34am
Impact: Impact Southbound traffic affected.
Attending: Emergency services
Advice: Reduce your speed
Exercise caution
1434 2018-11-28 22:00:54 The problem with these trusts based on oil or natural gas is the underlying cash flow comes from a declining asset. If the prices of the asset fall along with the production its double trouble.  A reversed scenario is what you want. Only know because we're in the game.
1435 2018-11-28 22:00:47 What was your best score during Cyber Monday and Black Friday? Who had the best deals? Share in the comments below for a chance to get $8 off an oil change. 
1436 2018-11-28 22:00:47 $USO oil closes at low of day and $XLE closed at high of day .  . .
What a joke, stock mrkt is based on hopium!
 
$TLT closes low of day, but JP said they're not hiking on predetermined course, so long bonds aren't buying the BS. Remember biggest bucket of $ is n bonds not stocks
1437 2018-11-28 22:00:46 Big day shaping up for #oil tomorrow #CL_F #OOTT
1438 2018-11-28 22:00:44 Finally getting an oil change
1439 2018-11-28 22:00:44 They should campaign against deforestation then :/ the palm oil itself isn't bad is it
1440 2018-11-28 22:00:43 November 28, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1441 2018-11-28 22:00:40 Crude Oil and agricultural exports mostly.
1442 2018-11-28 22:00:40 So much oil money in @UEFA’s and the referees pocket. Disgrace!
1443 2018-11-28 22:00:33 interesting is wtiu uso/wtic down yet gush up on volume. gush triple leveraged long oil companies and that is where big money parks money when bullish oil not the uso.
1444 2018-11-28 22:00:32 PSG and Man City are everything that’s wrong with football. Shake Allah Muhammed needs to stick to fucking oil and leave football for good

1451 2018-11-28 22:00:07 Obama tried to destroy our energy (oil and coal) so we would have to buy from his Muslim friends, and iran would have power over us, Obama is a traitor and should be dealt with
1452 2018-11-28 22:00:07 Peppermints, peppermint tea, and peppermint oil help. Basically anything with peppermint
1453 2018-11-28 21:59:55 How does Mark Wiens not get sickkkkkkk, or does he and we don’t know about it.... I mean I’m literally doing MashAllah MashAllah everytime he’s taking a bite from that oil dripping paratha ! 
1454 2018-11-28 21:59:52 CONT: No Canadian Tribe wants other Tribes to speak for them. Many are invested financially in the pipelines. They are NEVER built through Sacred Burial Grounds. Oil by rail is dangerous & foolish. USA is our biggest buyer of oil
1455 2018-11-28 21:59:48 maybe a few drops of lavender essential oil in her water dish too??
1456 2018-11-28 21:59:42 Obama wanted to put up friggin Windmills on every street corner. Drilling was considered criminal under his administration. He shut down/denied countless permits and was against all of it and now he’s trying to take credit for President Trump’s huge oil success? PATHETIC.
1457 2018-11-28 21:59:41 You are absolutely right! It’s not clean. But at least it’s cleaner than wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, gas, oil, hard coal, lignite. Before going for one of the dirtier alternatives or to have no electricity at all, maybe the cleanest possible (nuclear) might the best choice.
1458 2018-11-28 21:59:39 Oil and water is my favorite 
1459 2018-11-28 21:59:39 $XOM $20M deep ITM January Puts traded today. Someone not expecting a recovery in oil anytime soon it seems like. 
1460 2018-11-28 21:59:35 @Shanegillespie4 Sweeney oil
1461 2018-11-28 21:59:31 I am concerned at the amount of restaurant/ fast food places, who fry the chips in the same oil as the fish, I have a fish/seafood allergy, also I know a lot of vegetarians who are unaware they are consuming products cooked in oil with fish oil in
1462 2018-11-28 21:59:30 If I did that kind of thing. Why would I oil it
1463 2018-11-28 21:59:27 Hi Toni, thanks for reaching out! Our Baked line has been discontinued, but we do have Sea Salt chips that are 40% reduced fat, as well as our Avocado Oil and Almond Oil chips if you’re interested in trying something new.
1464 2018-11-28 21:59:25 I saw him up close and personal in 1960s and he wasn't much of an oil painting then!!!
1465 2018-11-28 21:59:22 Big oil are on the hunt for cheaper fields onshore are 50%  less per barrel to extract It seems logical that Onshore Fields as big as HH #UKOG will orth a look at with flow rates being hailed as the second best onshore in the UK and west Europe .Maybe No1 with horizontal nxt 2019
1466 2018-11-28 21:59:20 Obama, America's largest advocate on climate change and greenhouse gases just took credit for America being the largest oil producer. This man never ceases to amuse me
1467 2018-11-28 21:59:16 After taking credit for the positive job numbers and oil production.
1468 2018-11-28 21:59:16 Nice crisp air and white snow in Buffalo today. Urban snow is so nice before it starts to accumulate oil and grime.
1469 2018-11-28 21:59:14 ONLY  IF YOU JOIN ME ONE MORE SONG TONIGHT, OKAY, BUT ONLY IF YOU JOIN ME. ONCE, WHEN I WAS SAD, I SAID TO A KIND OLD PRIEST, HAVE YOU LEARNED ANY SECRETS TO UNBURNED THE HEART AND HE RESPONDED HUM A FAVORITE MELODY WINE WILL ALWAYS RISE TO THE TOP OF OF OIL.
1470 2018-11-28 21:59:06 I like to add peppermint extract oil to my drinking water
1471 2018-11-28 21:59:02 The Tyee is so anti oil it isn’t even funny anymore.
1472 2018-11-28 21:58:59 Continuing unwind of long oil short nat gas trade?
1473 2018-11-28 21:58:53 It needs to be big oil and fossil fuel first (aka Koch bros)
1474 2018-11-28 21:58:50 @ChampionsLeague need a bit more oil money do we? Worst refereeing performance I’ve seen in years. Someone justify Verrati staying on that pitch. #PSGLFC
1475 2018-11-28 21:58:49 Obama is such a liar.  I remember he was denying oil leases on federal land, and new drilling could only occur on private land.
1476 2018-11-28 21:58:48 Love it if we go through if only to somehow meet this Oil Money club of cheating bastards later on. #PSGLIV
1477 2018-11-28 21:58:46 Ahhh, c'mon man. Barry's not taking credit for this...only the economy, unemployment rate and making USA largest producer of oil and gas.
1478 2018-11-28 21:58:42 Love the mention of data governance  "If data is the new oil, then having a refinery to cleanse it, proper tanks to manage it, and defined policies on how to provide access to it is of key importance."
1479 2018-11-28 21:58:42 Fill some with vegetable oil to slick up the fence so it cant be climbed
1480 2018-11-28 21:58:42 This is incorrect. I only drink motor oil which happens to also be more flavorful than la crehoyminoy
1481 2018-11-28 21:58:41 When he retires from public office he will do a great job  selling snake oil 
1482 2018-11-28 21:58:33 @checks They took down the other Oil Services ETF I follow $XES pretty hard as well. Also down -30% YTD just above $12 bucks now!

1484 2018-11-28 21:58:32 Burning the midnight oil in #dail
1485 2018-11-28 21:58:31 Does  it smell like normal castor oil?
1486 2018-11-28 21:58:27 Difference is, DSGO won’t smell like BO and patchouli oil.
1487 2018-11-28 21:58:26 Arab oil FC wins again and pretty much through, what another sad day for football
1488 2018-11-28 21:58:26 Bitch castor oil!!
1489 2018-11-28 21:58:17 im not even gonna mention the ref, anyone with eyes could tell he was bought and paid for Qatar oil running through his veins the bald cunt.
1490 2018-11-28 21:58:14 Well that would be great but if you look in the past we have had many oil gluts. This is no guarantee there won’t be more. Expect it.
1491 2018-11-28 21:58:14 The pancakes are soaked in motor oil I don’t blame them
1492 2018-11-28 21:58:14 Still consider @RachelBronson1 's 'Thicker Than Oil' one of the most influential reads for my understanding of US-Saudi relations. Hope she is following @shadihamid 's current work on the role of Islam in foreign policy.
1493 2018-11-28 21:58:12 Like that other oil money team that's strolling their league, got no chance of lifting CL.
1494 2018-11-28 21:58:01 they beat the baby oil off dat nigga
1495 2018-11-28 21:57:57 @Marcotti you think everyone hates PSG because of their dirty oil money but actually they’ve spent loads and play like pricks. Never seen a team play with gamesmanship as their ace up the sleeve. Awful team.
1496 2018-11-28 21:57:56 Love it! Next step is ALBERTA OIL!! Owned and operated by ALBERTANS. Love the first bold move, now we need another!!
1497 2018-11-28 21:57:41 Fuck me. PSG are such a piece of shit club tbh. Slimey fucks diving constantly, add to that they're an oil club. Pathetic
1498 2018-11-28 21:57:40 The man who shut down the oil business. Lying.
1499 2018-11-28 21:57:40 Hahaha oil money with treachery
1500 2018-11-28 21:57:30 But that's ok. We'll take that oil problem off of your hands.
1501 2018-11-28 21:57:28 Oil makes us need them. Get on renewables and we can get them under control. Just one more reason why we must go green!
1502 2018-11-28 21:57:27 HAHAHAHAHAHA WHERE'S ONE SEASON WONDER? 

Viva oil money
1503 2018-11-28 21:57:26 Take our oil, beat tonight. But Jesus Christ! That PSG team are the biggest bunch of diving, crying bastards going. Just an ugly bastard of a team. Scum of the earth.
1504 2018-11-28 21:57:22 The only oil this buffon drilled for was when his finger poked through his toilet paper
1505 2018-11-28 21:57:07 What this simply means that JAMB has been overcharging parents and masses over the years to oil private pockets. Yet some people said that increase in revenue by JAMB does not matter
1506 2018-11-28 21:57:06 Sucks to not be in an oil producing country 
1507 2018-11-28 21:57:05 time for you too find a different sector of my headpeice , for my gatherings have recently mentioned that it is probably time for an oil change , almost any oil change . good day !?! ....
1508 2018-11-28 21:57:04 I ordered some oil that was manufactured in Israel, knowing who handles my mail before I get it, I'll just have to check it for Lead and Mercury before using. What a lawsuit that would be against the USPS!
1509 2018-11-28 21:57:01 PSG are bloody horrible. Hope their oil money doesn't buy the champions league #PSGLIV
1510 2018-11-28 21:56:58 Oil money diving cunts
1511 2018-11-28 21:56:55 PSG are everything that’s wrong with modern football. Oil money, play acting, paying players bonuses to clap their fans, plastic flags, Neymar.
1512 2018-11-28 21:56:50 What idiot thinks America could become the largest oil producer in just 2 short years? Those willing to be honest know the last 8 years was the catalyst toward America being the largest oil producer.
1513 2018-11-28 21:56:47 JESUS CHRIST

(That’s where I was going with the olive oil - a skin protectant/lubricant)
1514 2018-11-28 21:56:45 I 100% was that female, until I got my first new car back in ‘07. My Dad asked me bout an oil change and looked at my with disgust cause I’d had the car for 6-months and hadn’t gotten one. That’s when he schooled me on the basic maintenance and the importance of warming up.
1515 2018-11-28 21:56:40 It's funny to hear North Dakota all excited about the oil boom. It's a boom. It will end. When it does, people will leave and those left will be on the hook paying for all the shit they're building now.
1516 2018-11-28 21:56:39 PSG are the dirtiest most oil funded fucking frog club ever. Their players are fucking disgusting cheats, and they Neymar cunt needs to be shut up and shot. Fuck me.
1517 2018-11-28 21:56:33 Oil money and steroids win the day again
1518 2018-11-28 21:56:33 I will repeat just so you get it, we pay Taxes  @@theSNP who Gov us give us Enhancements (Freebies). We also semd Most of our taxes to Englands Tresuary Dept Then they send back a small amount (in kindness) However they robs us of all oil Revenues which they have Squandered.
1519 2018-11-28 21:56:25  try to avoid sugary foods and sweets/chocolate 

 drink lemon water every morning

 put coconut oil/ vaseline on your eyelashes and eyebrows to make them thicker and longer 

don’t touch your face 

 take luke warm showers 

 rinse your hair with cold water
1520 2018-11-28 21:56:11 @BarackObama exactly what did you do to increase oil production in America?  All those executive orders open up new oil exploration?  Off-shore drilling?  Nah ..you stymied growth and opportunity..stop fooling yourself..#blowhard
1521 2018-11-28 21:56:02 Funny how the referee appears to give all the decisions to the team with the oil money #cheats #12men #checkhisbankaccounts
1522 2018-11-28 21:56:02 We can switch over to all solar/wind on our power grid and it won’t make a dent in the 20 millions barrels of oil we consume daily. Our cars are not powered by wind/solar, neither are our planes or trucks.
1523 2018-11-28 21:55:56 I’m using the Macadamia natural oil deep repair masque rn . And I loooove it bc my ends are so dry from dying it, so when I put it in my hair feels so smoooth
1524 2018-11-28 21:55:54 This is OBVIOUSLY about money, the inflated arms deal lines #backwater Eric Prince’s pockets.  Taxpayers should not support inefficient oil wars.
1525 2018-11-28 21:55:49 Yeah. USDCAD went through today, but not oil.
1526 2018-11-28 21:55:37 there goes the oil
1527 2018-11-28 21:55:27 How annoyed would Putin be that Venezula is paying China first but not paying Russia? Only matter of time before China or Russia go in an take over oil fields and refineries. That would create tensions between the bromance of China and Russia.
1528 2018-11-28 21:55:21 There a bunch of cunts absolute disgrace this lot,surprising what dirty oil money can get you
1529 2018-11-28 21:55:18 Anointing oil and the blood of Jesus 
1530 2018-11-28 21:55:16 how many more times do I have to see the “I know it’s motor oil” and “it’s shaving cream we ain’t dumb” tweets
1531 2018-11-28 21:55:15 @PSG_English - you make me sick. Money cannot buy you class. @neymarjr - you’re an absolute joke. Man up. Stop crying/diving/being a lil bitch-boy. If class were money you lot would be skint af. Lost any respect I did have. Hope your oil runs out. Fuck you.
1532 2018-11-28 21:55:11 Ugh, that chart demonstrates my disillusionment with the Democratic party.  Their top favored candidate is also the top recipient of oil lobby money.  Looks like the dems want to lose the progressive vote yet again.
1533 2018-11-28 21:55:06 I have also very healthy hair and still my own color. 
I love the taste of real butter. I only use the coconut oil for frying together with the butter. Sometimes put a bit in my hair and on my body.
1534 2018-11-28 21:55:04 Got my oil changed and they decided to give me an estimate on how much new tires would be & they said 750  like mf I used a coupon on this oil change I will crash before I pay that much for tires
1535 2018-11-28 21:55:02 I seem to remember that Barry fought the Pipeline and anything to do with Oil or Coal; Barry needs some Counseling! with HRC, maybe a 2 for 1 deal?
1536 2018-11-28 21:55:02 oh hell to the no!
he tried to shut down oil drilling in america.
who the hell does he think will believe his lies.
1537 2018-11-28 21:55:01 It is such a change, but it's not a change, because it's still about big #money and #oil and resources: so who the hell do you trust? probably nobody.
1538 2018-11-28 21:55:01 Let them drink oil and eat sand
1539 2018-11-28 21:54:57 @JohnCornyn Please help to get us out of Yemen.  Texas can lead in solar and wind, we are doing well at it now.  We don't need to be involved in an unjust war, killing children, to get oil.  Texans are good people and this is a bad war.
1540 2018-11-28 21:54:55 Trudeau should fix deficit with China and stop importing oil first, it may be that China should not tax Canadian made cars
1541 2018-11-28 21:54:45 Olive oil hasn't been used in the production of catgut for over a century. (E8 Fromage)
1542 2018-11-28 21:54:32 Do a little research before you post pure garbage.  President Obama can absolutely take credit for U.S. Oil and Natural Gas production dominance since 2011!!
1543 2018-11-28 21:54:24 Yo a vos te conozco de la oil
1544 2018-11-28 21:54:17 That will be the same SNP analysis of oil at $106/br in their 13/14 forecast, when Scotland became independent.  Brent Crude is currently at $59/br.......Nothing like egging your own agenda....
1545 2018-11-28 21:54:09 I was in P7 when McNaughton came to our school and explained his nickname and it was to do with him being covered in oil. Wasn't til I was older I realised what he was talking about.
1546 2018-11-28 21:54:09 He got that potent snake oil
1547 2018-11-28 21:54:04 No thanks to oil.
1548 2018-11-28 21:54:01 You're aware, that any solar or wind installations create jobs, right? in fact, in the United States right now solar and wind jobs are more numerous than anything in the oil industry. Food for thought.
1549 2018-11-28 21:54:01 How is veratti still on the pitch,that dirty oil money gets you out of some dodgy spots #FuckPSG
1550 2018-11-28 21:54:00 I'm not letting anything like that anywhere near my aging mouth -- and I've been known to make a meal of a loaf of bread and really good olive oil. Sore jaw muscles? Sure. Bleeding gums? No thanks.
1551 2018-11-28 21:54:00 y is everyone mad abt the motor oil cardboard crap lmfao u rlly thought it was real ? yall STOOPID stoopid

>Griping about the wealthy
Its not the liberals preventing the trains from being built, the biggest issue is the fact that its expensive and car, tire, and oil lobbyists are working to promote freeways and cars over public transit.
1556 2018-11-28 21:53:41 Highest mortgage interest highest heating oil 3 rd highest electricity highest wine highestnew car etc
1557 2018-11-28 21:53:38 Deranged. What about all the American oil rigs he shut down in the Gulf after that one rig mysteriously exploded??? Deranged
@michellemalkin
1558 2018-11-28 21:53:36 my new suite mate I don’t want to weird out so that she likes me: “haha why do you have a quart of motor oil in your room?”

me: “oh lol no that’s not oil that’s fake blood”
1559 2018-11-28 21:53:28 They aren't the ones where the battle is being fought.

It's the non ideologues who believed the snake oil.

1561 2018-11-28 21:53:14 A body has been found off the coast of Carpinteria near the oil rigs.  The Coroner's office ID's - 61-year-old Adrian Navaro Ramirez  of Buena Park. No suspicious circumstances. Family had called the Coast Guard to report an overdue kayaker.
1562 2018-11-28 21:53:13 @GM @chevrolet serious question. How is it that I haven’t had my new 2016 Chevy Malibu LT for two years and I NEED A NEW ENGINE!? A whole Engine! And I who kept up with oil changes n I  still have to come out my pockets! Never Again @GM betcha thought
1563 2018-11-28 21:53:05 I read the Interrim Protctive Measures which references AER and future development.  That is the one I am not sure I understand.  Page 6 refers to oil and gas projects.
1564 2018-11-28 21:52:59 The Rockefeller family sold us trillions of barrels of oil over the last decades and pushed the electric car technology out of the way deliberately purely out of greed. That’s not entrepreneurship. That’s criminal. Criminals don’t strive to work hard or make the world better.
1565 2018-11-28 21:52:58 if ever there was a game to watch to show the world that football and its officials are corrupt with oil money

1568 2018-11-28 21:52:39 Why, Donald, I do believe it was the United States, over Russia.  In fact, the U.S. has been the top oil producer in the world since 2013, and the top producer of natural gas 2011-16 (recent figures not available).  Yep, smack in the middle of the Obama presidency. Fancy that!
1569 2018-11-28 21:52:36 Drink  red oil  pliz
1570 2018-11-28 21:52:31 How extraordinarily primitive. Almost as outdated as thinking it's clever to pump oil out of the ground and burn it.
1571 2018-11-28 21:52:31 Clickbait. Big oil has a lot of pull with the media. Except for FOX. They're too busy sucking on Trump's Toad to come up for the air Big oil is peddling. Elon is fine. I swear these guys have a quota to fill. So many misdirection articles at the end of every month. SMH.
1572 2018-11-28 21:52:31 He shut down the oil sector so we can start his green energy wind  solar job-killing green energy sector green energy has it even employed anyone

1574 2018-11-28 21:52:23 Hmmm I know a dude who worked in the oil fields.. nobody that works in the oil fields liked obama or democrats at all..
1575 2018-11-28 21:52:23 When ww pray for our daily bread, remember some are praying for puff puff oil to touch their hand.  
Whatever we can do for our neighbors let's try to do that because if we must meet our needs, we all will be selfish.
1576 2018-11-28 21:52:22 Quit buying their oil. It’s only 11%. Quit selling them weapons.
1577 2018-11-28 21:52:20 And to mention that palm oil is bad for your heart. Not healthy at all.
1578 2018-11-28 21:52:07 Oil money wrecked the game..
1579 2018-11-28 21:52:04 You will separate like oil and water
1580 2018-11-28 21:51:56 Not sure what to think on China talks. Want to go in on some oil, but it's all depends on trade deals or it tanks more.
1581 2018-11-28 21:51:55 Find an oil cologne connect mixed them two together and bam! He has both of his favs and won't smell like any1 else....oils last longer too 
1582 2018-11-28 21:51:52 Hmm, didn't he try to reduce our oil production? I'm old and forget things you know.
1583 2018-11-28 21:51:52 Obama, America's largest advocate on climate change and greenhouse gases just took credit for America being the largest oil producer. This man never ceases to amuse me
1584 2018-11-28 21:51:46 This is moronic. Big oil pays just fine, fool.
1585 2018-11-28 21:51:43 #QE4 has started. It started with the take down on oil lead by our @realDonaldTrump with the backing of the #HFTGoons @ NY Fed, media & deep captured @EIAgov. That's phase 1, now today Jerome admits the economy sucks phase 2. Oil was the DNA at today's crime scene. @TFMetals
1586 2018-11-28 21:51:42 You get a tax return?! How in the hell do you manage that? Seems like everybody gets a tax return but me. My dad has an oil well and HE gets one!! We live on a teacher's salary and no such luck! I need to buy something to write off! LOL
1587 2018-11-28 21:51:42 @SenTedCruz    I hope you will vote to stop our involvement in Yemen.  Texas has oil, and we have solar and wind.  We don't need to kill children halfway around the world to get oil
1588 2018-11-28 21:51:41 Next pay check ima get my damn new tire and oil change until then this doughnut will continue to work !!
1589 2018-11-28 21:51:38 Lost in ALL conversations on Russia is the fact that their economy is 10% of ours and that 60+% of their budget is oil dependent. Ignore them. Frack, baby, frack.

1593 2018-11-28 21:51:26 Current shale oil is not profitable. A higher oil price in dollar term  is what the doctor would want.
1594 2018-11-28 21:51:19 This loss will be even more harder to take coz of the blatant cheating and unbelievable shiteness of the ref. Oil money can kiss me arse
1595 2018-11-28 21:51:19 got my oil changed last week getting new tires today man i’m bouta be allll over vegas when i get home

1597 2018-11-28 21:51:15 I wonder if Trump or someone in his admin, or a big oil and gas donor, called and asked them to put Santorum on instead of you?  I’m losing any interest in their programming.  I will say that.
1598 2018-11-28 21:51:13 Screw you.  They dismembered a man alive.  Why? Because he said mean things about them.  No amount of oil or profit should be worth that.  You have to be the worst diplomat ever.
1599 2018-11-28 21:51:07 Oil is critical to your economy. It has to be shipped somehow and pipelines are safer than oil trains.

1605 2018-11-28 21:50:50 Weed has really evolved since I was a kid. I remember kids were paying $20 for a “gram.” 

My friend from Cali just sent me a video of him putting weed-infused tanning oil on his arms.

1607 2018-11-28 21:50:48 Shouldn’t Iraq get statehood first so it seems less internationally illegal when trump asks for the oil?
1608 2018-11-28 21:50:29 “I already know that there’s cardboard and motor oil” bitch we all watched the video so shut the fuck up already
1609 2018-11-28 21:50:26 has @DennysDiner weighed in on the cardboard and motor oil stuff yet?
1610 2018-11-28 21:50:13 Such a sad small bitter man
1611 2018-11-28 21:50:04 If i see another fucking pancake with a quote about motor oil im going to shut down twitter
1612 2018-11-28 21:49:55 mmmm motor oil
1613 2018-11-28 21:49:54 It's probably much more than that. Just look at the persistent unemployment in Alberta despite the recovery of the global oil and gas sector.
1614 2018-11-28 21:49:51 So I’m thinking of starting like a mini automotive service business just for some extra income. I can read codes, possibly perform what needs to be done on those codes, oil change, tire rotation, full detail, minor mechanical work, etc.
1615 2018-11-28 21:49:50 It's not whether you believe in climate change or not. It's whether oil, gas and coal industries own you or not.
1616 2018-11-28 21:49:48 電車の中で勉強します、、
1617 2018-11-28 21:49:40 If you switch grid electric supply away from oil and gas, you're also creating an oversupply of the oil market because you're decreasing demand. Solar and wind decrease demand for oil and gas.

And it's a more long term solution since running out of sun and wind is hard than gas
1618 2018-11-28 21:49:17 But Saudi only provides 11% of America's oil supply.  We get 40% from Canada.  we could produce enough to last us while we convert to alternative clean energy sources.
1619 2018-11-28 21:49:17 He also said he turned the US into one of the greatest oil producing nations!! How does that reconcile with your tree hugging disciples? Or did you not bother retweeting that one?
1620 2018-11-28 21:49:09 It might. 

I’d try soaking in alcohol first, to see if that’ll loosen the glue, then soak in oil to remove the glue from your nails.

1624 2018-11-28 21:49:01 I mean...an even better question is why we subsidize Oil, which already has the money of a small country for itself.

1634 2018-11-28 21:48:21 A lot of celebs say they put coconut oil on their face but I’m like that would break my face out really bad. Any oil breaks my face out
1635 2018-11-28 21:48:19 Hello, Im a palm oil farmer whos new to the slash and burned area. Do you know where I might avail my nut with a high dexterity apehand
1636 2018-11-28 21:48:17 just got a PHAT insurance check i’m buying leo oil and slippers
1637 2018-11-28 21:48:16 UN must support govts to sieze fossil fuel assets if Big Oil doesn't comply. Targets must be made legally binding. At this stage there can't be any more talk about 'ambition'.
1638 2018-11-28 21:48:15 What a liar. He tried to stop all oil production in the US. Stopped the pipeline.
1639 2018-11-28 21:48:05 Is that all fries, including baked...with a light Spritz of olive oil? Just wondering...
1640 2018-11-28 21:48:01 Good grief, what an ego! He did everything in his power to strangle oil and coal production in the US!
1641 2018-11-28 21:47:58 Show first and let's look at the contact with Big Oil and Big Coal then.
1642 2018-11-28 21:47:58 Shit my oil change light turned on this morning. How?...
1643 2018-11-28 21:47:53 ... can I deep fry him in holy oil?
1644 2018-11-28 21:47:46 Fracking became practical because the oil prices skyrocketed under Barry Hussein.
1645 2018-11-28 21:47:44 Meanwhile in ABLeg NDP Sarah Hoffman continues to demean herself by refusing to answer critical questions on AB oil crisis NDP don’t have a clue
1646 2018-11-28 21:47:43 Cold pressing refers to oils obtained through pressing fruit or seeds with a steel press, Indian sceanario it's common juice Walla next door. Cold pressed oils retain all their flavour, aroma, and nutritional value, making this oil great for cooking and skin care requirements.
1647 2018-11-28 21:47:40 I came to get an oil change on my Car and they stay trying to do more than just change the oil. This is why I let my stepdad do this stuff when I go to Amarillo 
1648 2018-11-28 21:47:36 have you tried soaking your fingers in warm olive oil?
1649 2018-11-28 21:47:26 Of course. Here our reps try to take credit for anything good & blame others for anything bad. I know all to well how it works. But its quite ballsy of Mr Obama to say thank me, knowing full well he did everything he could to reduce oil production, in favor of environmental regs
1650 2018-11-28 21:47:24 #MyFavoritePartOfChildhood the smell of my Dad, that mix of old spice, brylcream, diesel oil, gasoline and grease, and the feel of his five o'clock shadow as he kissed me on the cheek and tucked me into bed. Miss you Pop!
1651 2018-11-28 21:47:22 Big Oil has left the building.
1652 2018-11-28 21:47:16 Assuming this is in ref to state actions only, Faisal cut off oil to the US over the Yom Kippur War. It's the only time I can think of.
1653 2018-11-28 21:47:11 It left me greasy I looked like I’d dipped in oil
1654 2018-11-28 21:47:04 Why would he put together a package for Oshawa when Oil is losing 80 Billion a day? He has not addressed this issue. He better look there first as it has crippled the economy in Alberta and Canada. It's coming next year for the Oshawa plant. First things first!!!
1655 2018-11-28 21:47:03 i tried motor oil on my pancakes and it is not good
1656 2018-11-28 21:46:57 ? Our President is attempting to educate on economic decisions. If tariffs are greater Ms. Who, items cost more (Boston tea party, Asian spice trade, and oil for examples.) If our exports are bringing in more than our imports our economy is stronger and Americans are like
1657 2018-11-28 21:46:51 Ya know, I’m really OK with all the cleaning stuff. So rewarding to turn around and see a sparkling kitchen! (Not even joking.) BUT: car stuff? Tires, oil changes, service, getting it washed... hate.
1658 2018-11-28 21:46:50 Vista Oil & Gas
1659 2018-11-28 21:46:50 The Saudis fund their government though the sale of oil, the only thing to drop the price of oil is oversupplying the oil market. Too much oil, the price of oil will go down, less money for the Saudis. Solar and wind won’t accomplish that.
1660 2018-11-28 21:46:41 @MelissaAFrancis russia was the only one bombing the oil tankers headed into turkey from Syria while Obama was still president....... almost made me like them if it wasn't for the Ukraine
1661 2018-11-28 21:46:40 The important thing to note is how much pricing power Alberta has on the oil markets. Say, compared to what a number of the leading countries that exported petroleum would have if they formed some kind of organization.
1662 2018-11-28 21:46:39 May chicken oil na sa mang i
1663 2018-11-28 21:46:33 We just got coal going again. Leave them out if it. We need back up if nothing else. One bad storm and all else goes down. At least coal is a sure thing. Also Oil & Gas shld be USA gold for us too. But Cheaper still to $1.25 gal. No more since it’s explored here in USA.
1664 2018-11-28 21:46:32 But we are still buying thier blood oil
1665 2018-11-28 21:46:23 Oil and gas workers don’t vote @NDP so they don’t matter.
1666 2018-11-28 21:46:20 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks close at session highs with the Dow Industrials picking up 618 points, the Nasdaq Comp. jumping 3%, the S&P +2.3%

1667 2018-11-28 21:45:55 Inflation numbers are going to be atrocious tm with oil down 30% in a month. Expectations are for a positive .2 move. That’s going to be bearish stocks tm morning .
1668 2018-11-28 21:45:49 Neck Oil. Love that stuff.
1669 2018-11-28 21:45:47 Well if the 1970s are any guide, I would expect oil to soar in dollar terms, especially if the dollar loses the only backing it has other than the US Govt's ability to honor its value. Last time Gold, this time Oil. Dollar tumbles.
1670 2018-11-28 21:45:41 Oil, GDP and Jobs...

Barack "You didnt build that" Obama lives in a fantasy world...
1671 2018-11-28 21:45:40 As an analogy, imagine if the EU passed a directive limiting the battery size on electronic cars to only allow a range of 20 miles. A lot of people would claim interference from big oil interests. Well that's what happened with vaping.
1672 2018-11-28 21:45:40 Pretty sure I just lost a gram of oil & im super sad about it
1673 2018-11-28 21:45:18 No one: 
people who steal tweets: nah bitch that syrup is motor oil and thats shaving cream on that pie hoe you not fooling me
1674 2018-11-28 21:45:14 tick tick tick #oil #oott
1675 2018-11-28 21:45:01 possibly some of the gas/oil plays still unwinding? natty up over 8%.
1676 2018-11-28 21:45:01 I been at work all day and it was kinda hectic so no lol but I am going to the store and gonna get some essential oil to steam in the shower and some soup bc it’s cold out
1677 2018-11-28 21:44:56 This whole belly itch when pregnant is real you know! I keep tapping my belly as if I’ve got a weave on because scratching is not an option, no ma’am! The amount of oil I’m going through yeah, loooool madting.
1678 2018-11-28 21:44:54 And there was I thinking that the Arab world has spent hundreds of billions on lobbying/blackmailing western governments, universities, NGOs etc etc. Plus decades of boycotts, oil embargoes etc etc
1679 2018-11-28 21:44:53 The us was the biggest oil producer long before you came to office
1680 2018-11-28 21:44:52 OPEC, a cartel of oil producing nations, does this by fiat, affecting world price changes. Want to hurt US shale, OPEC ramps up supply to force oil price lower. The reverse is true. A (preferred) industry voluntary reduxn in Alberta can affect region price the same way.
1681 2018-11-28 21:44:51 Seems to me refineries to upgrade that thick bitumen to a good grade oil would make us more $$ in the long run.  The US make their big bucks off us by doing just that.
1682 2018-11-28 21:44:47 Orangutans are becoming endangered because of the deforestation used for palm oil
1683 2018-11-28 21:44:42 “No smoking gun”.  Wtf 
It was an electric bone saw and acid.   What oil is #Mattis smoking ?
1684 2018-11-28 21:44:38 เหมือนกันเลยค่ะ เริ่มติ่งกัซจาก win ตอนนั้นเราเมนมาร์คมาเลยตั้งแต่แรกเห็น. ขอบคุณรายการนี้จริงๆ
1685 2018-11-28 21:44:31 I need to stop playing and get this oil changed 
1686 2018-11-28 21:44:15 If we invested in alternative forms of energy and increasingly away from oil, we wouldn’t have to worry about Saudi Arabi.
1687 2018-11-28 21:44:13 Zara need some more olive oil for her hair
1688 2018-11-28 21:44:11 I meet him often at a service station called Kanon Oil in Msasa. He is quite a nice old man. He drives a lime green Nissan XTrail with a Dutch Reformed Church logo on the doors.
1689 2018-11-28 21:44:11 He had the Magic Wand for oil production too?
1690 2018-11-28 21:44:09 yes you are right..intriguing to watch.
1691 2018-11-28 21:44:06 Maybe if he'd just delete some text he'd be writing accurate ad copy.  Is it the case that buying buses from

Proterra Inc. will:
* Save time and money on maintenance
* Provide your maintenance crew with a safe and clean solution
* Avoid costly oil change problems
1692 2018-11-28 21:44:06 Mumu talk.

1694 2018-11-28 21:43:59 Inflation numbers going to be awful tm morning. Median forecast .2 but probably going to be negative -.5. With oil down 30% in a month. Can’t think of a bullish scenario for tm.
1695 2018-11-28 21:43:59 The oil industry is simply too dangerous for Americans. While it may create jobs and generate some money, renewable energy is an industry that, when it starts booming, will create more jobs and money than ever. #2050 #RenewableEnergy
1696 2018-11-28 21:43:53 Yay! I brought $150 worth of Winsor and Newton oil paints for my in-law & one of them exploded in shipping. I requested a replacement for the one damaged paint, but they're sending the whole order again free of charge and we can keep the first ones! He'll be so happy
1697 2018-11-28 21:43:47 Obama will find a way to take credit for the seats President Trump gained in the Senate.  He’s taking credit for our booming economy and use of domestic oil.
1698 2018-11-28 21:43:39 You gotta love this guy, he forgets he stopped the keystone pipeline, stopped offshore drilling and put other restrictions on oil/gas land discoveries. What a beauty this guy is. @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo
1699 2018-11-28 21:43:18 America has ALWAYS been the largest oil producer.  Largest in the world.

1701 2018-11-28 21:43:08 I salute you sis. Big respect on you for taking on these peddlers of snake oil.
1702 2018-11-28 21:43:00 And if I were to show otherwise you’d claim they were in the pay of “big oil”... Funny you guys don’t realize you’re showing all the signs of a cult...
1703 2018-11-28 21:42:52 Saudi Arabia's minister of petroleum visits Dr Ibe Kachuwku in Nigeria.
Ibe has got a lot of clout and respect in the oil and gas industry, globally 
.Shame he isn't the driver of our petroleum ministry.
1704 2018-11-28 21:42:51 Oil down to like 50 a barrel ... not good lol
1705 2018-11-28 21:42:49 Wonder how much dirty oil money P$$G gave this ref?
1706 2018-11-28 21:42:48 What crushing, who's crushing. The market reduced the price, oil companies reacted. The market improved the price, oil companies brought some back because of efficiencies.  Now you cons, all of a sudden, don't like markets and want government to price, reduce, build, & demand.
1707 2018-11-28 21:42:35 Thanks. Fresh oil on you in Jesus' name! May your fingers never get tired!
1708 2018-11-28 21:42:34 Senator, if Human rights is really the issue on this case, what say Ye of the Continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas or the GENOCIDE of Southern Cameroon approved by the French to steal oil and gas?. TRUTH IS SUPREME.
1709 2018-11-28 21:42:30 Please ANSWER 2 QUESTIONS: 1) With DIRE Gov  report on climate WHY are we STILL giving OIL Comps HUGE TAX BREAKS?  2) Why aren't YOU providing alternatives to WALL like DRONES to monitor/track illegals who cross border: MORE EFFECTIVE & tiny fraction of COST?  WHY NOT Senator?
1710 2018-11-28 21:42:30 Head look like a big ass oil spill
1711 2018-11-28 21:42:19 So many people who work in the oil business in Lousiana were layed off for yrs. when he was in office. Lost homes and More. 
What a LIER.
1712 2018-11-28 21:42:16 High GDP countries should be monetarily compensating Brazil for the ecosystem services the Amazon provides. We all benefit from these services, and just like we pay countries for oil, Brazil should be paid for their natural resources!
1713 2018-11-28 21:42:16 The oilfield companies are all slowing everything up here in Saskatchewan, no worries about them giving it away, they’re just shutting in wells now... again... they don’t want to give away the oil either.
1714 2018-11-28 21:42:16 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
1715 2018-11-28 21:42:15 We don't give coconut oil enough credit...
1716 2018-11-28 21:42:06 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1717 2018-11-28 21:42:06 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1718 2018-11-28 21:42:04 Aww thank you! Try massaging them with castor oil and take some vitamin tablets for hair! For filling in, ABH dipbrow is the best x
1719 2018-11-28 21:42:01 #Obama made America the largest oil producer just like #AlGore invented the internet.
1720 2018-11-28 21:41:58 Still importing gas from Washington State with Alberta oil.
1721 2018-11-28 21:41:57 I’m punishing myself by watching no oil cooking YouTube videos
1722 2018-11-28 21:41:54 ? How much oil is there in Crimea ?
Just wondered why Crimea so important to Putin.
1723 2018-11-28 21:41:49 @sullivanradio Tom, my wife suffers from Fibromyalgia, and finds relief by smoking pot. She doesn't often, because it's still illegal in our state. She has tried CBD oil, without much success. I would try it (recreational), but I am subject to random tests in my employ.
1724 2018-11-28 21:41:48 Hi Rose. Your pizza with tomatoes and motor oil will be delivered in 15 min via the Hindenburg.
1725 2018-11-28 21:41:46 IMO end of Petrodollar means the price of gold will skyrocket in oil terms - see Gold/oil ratio up 60% past 7 wks.  End of Petro$ simply gives US a choice: It can have cheap gold & no domestic shale sector, or expensive gold (UST loses primary rsv asset status) & booming shale
1726 2018-11-28 21:41:37 Check out their investments in China. Sounds like LBJ keeping the tanks rolling while owning oil. Funny Feinstein, Blumenthal, and Madonna hope he drops ..........
1727 2018-11-28 21:41:36 Raise taxes on gasoline refineries!
Raise taxes on oil & electricity that provides heat & A/C!
Raise taxes on food & grocery distributors!
Government will only tax the "polluters"! Won't cost you a cent!
"Good" people will get $$ back in "monthly rebate checks". Trust us!!!
1728 2018-11-28 21:41:31 Senator, what's the difference between your tweets to aid and save the Venezuelans, but then ignore test gasr on Hondurans and deportation of Salvadorans and Haitians? Oh, Venezuelan oil fields! Gotcha! Praise be! Under his eye!
1729 2018-11-28 21:41:28 Mr green jeans ?  I think not.
1730 2018-11-28 21:41:27 I used to use Cantu but that dried my hair out way too much. Now I use Palmer's shampoo/conditioner with castor oil. A week after washing I'll use the oil every night before bed then wrap my hair up. After that, maybe twice a week.
1731 2018-11-28 21:41:25 I hear they got good throat oil for that cough
1732 2018-11-28 21:41:25 I think my pancakes are due for an oil change.
1733 2018-11-28 21:41:13 every day the President issues alternative facts, Mitch Mcconnell writes a song about #love
1734 2018-11-28 21:41:09 Yay!  I started with watercolor a very long time ago and eventually got into acrylic and oil painting.  This is so great, Kelly!  You're going to have so much fun.
1735 2018-11-28 21:41:09 I feel ya, mine is long thick and curly/frizzy. What I’ve found is from an online shopping club, and I use two different ones alternately. The premium shampoo and conditioner is pricey, but better than anything off the shelf. Also a leave in conditioner and Argan oil.
1736 2018-11-28 21:41:09 Still interesting what oil sellers thinking at current levels, when pushing red buttons  :)
1737 2018-11-28 21:41:08 Saudi Arabia supports #Yeman 
$11 Billion since 2012
$60 Million (Oil products for the operation of power plants)
$300 Million emergency humanitarian relief
Deposits in the central bank of Yaman
-2012 $1 Billion
-2018 $2 Billions
Hundreds of immediate medical operations
Iran = 0
1738 2018-11-28 21:41:06 India has reported a whopping jump in oil imports from Iran in October in face of US sanctions that officials in Washington earlier said were meant to bring the Islamic Republic’s crucial sales of oil to zero. India’s official figures show the country imported as much as 2.57 mln
1739 2018-11-28 21:40:59 Left over turkey, pulled and fried with a little oil, a little barbeque sauce, and a little siracha soy sauce.... on a bun, with a little mayo and jalapeno slices. 

That was damn good. 

I ate it before I could get a picture to share.
1740 2018-11-28 21:40:54 then L’Oreal is almost 1/4 owned by Nestle so you’d think “free chocolate” but then they’re also in violation of sustainable palm oil practices so that’s messed that one up
1741 2018-11-28 21:40:53 He actually used but his sweat was just too konk, he used a perfume oil even but the sweat was much and should have used body spray before coming to church after work
1742 2018-11-28 21:40:52 #BrookeShields squished that Sesame oil vacantly through #AliciaSilverstone's puppies and is blaming me! #affectionate
1743 2018-11-28 21:40:49 A whole lot less oil
1744 2018-11-28 21:40:49 anybody who thinks those motor oil pancakes don’t look tantalising is lying and wrong
1745 2018-11-28 21:40:40 I need to put you on an oil routine
1746 2018-11-28 21:40:39 Yes from Tyson but I think the behaviour of wilder was real even if he only wanted to pretend hes hysterical and that energy should not be ignited 3 days before a fight well done Tyson no matter how the fight goes he won the first round.
@Boxing_UK_ @Tyson_Fury @BronzeBomber
1747 2018-11-28 21:40:37 are you a colored pencil sapphic, a watercolor sapphic, or an oil pastel sapphic?
1748 2018-11-28 21:40:34 Some speculated crude oil will fly up back in Oct,but i did a quick short ,is a pity that i covered way too early.I knew he sees “opportunities “ to claim credit
1749 2018-11-28 21:40:34 I have oily skin and it has castor oil in it so it just breaks down my makeup even more:/
1750 2018-11-28 21:40:30 Obama takes credit for Trump accomplishments. including, Oil Boom!
1751 2018-11-28 21:40:26 …ぐぅ
1752 2018-11-28 21:40:22 i remember i bit fish oil and it bursted in my mouth when my friend offered me some but i didnt know what they were or what it was for Huehue
1753 2018-11-28 21:40:16 Working under a truck and rain starts to poor honestly sucks  All the okd oil and greas hits you in the face and its like man is this what it feels like when
1754 2018-11-28 21:40:16 Geez not doing a good job with economy Stevo...Its more like voodoo economic witch doctor snake oil sales man stuff...Using immigration numbers to pro up botton line...A shocker..
1755 2018-11-28 21:40:09 What food products are the fish oil & meal being replaced by? The fish don’t eat progress, sustainability, innovation or new ways of thinking after all?
1756 2018-11-28 21:40:08 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
1757 2018-11-28 21:40:05 AND there's also facial cleansing lotions which are different and are used to remove makeup and oil and all that good stuff from your face.
1758 2018-11-28 21:40:02 I'm more likely to drink motor oil than a peppermint mocha
1759 2018-11-28 21:39:58 Lets cover our eyes and go blaah blaah blaah and pretend North sea oil is infinite....forty years max
1760 2018-11-28 21:39:52 I use it for everything. Unrefined & organic. My hair is the longest it's ever been, made it to my butt. I got a friend that was losing his hair to use one part this with one part castor oil, amazing results.
1761 2018-11-28 21:39:50 Although in his defense, he pumped a shit ton of oil directly in the Gulf of Mexico
1762 2018-11-28 21:39:49 We need to a least(we are already Aviation capable in this technology) have a Pilot Project on Bio Fuels that will help Notley(provinces) out because oil will not get Alberta out of a mess this time!!
1763 2018-11-28 21:39:42 Who did you vote for? And you believed the snake oil salesman?
1764 2018-11-28 21:39:39 'Also tell me why people in Venezuela starve. Because they have too much capitalism?'

The crisis in Venezuela is down to a combination of the fall in global oil prices, the variable exchange rate introduced in 2003, the counter-productivity of Maduro's efforts to address ...
1765 2018-11-28 21:39:29 Alberta's oil is the most expensive to refine as well.  Now the US has stepped up production, it's value will be even less. The run is over. Better clean up the biggest man made environmental on the planet so our next generation can grow something worthwhile.
1766 2018-11-28 21:39:26 @LouDobbs The Saudies have always wanted to ruin our oil industry and are doing it now. They will take advantage of having us with an oil industry NOT UP AND RUNNING IN CASE PROBLEMS
1767 2018-11-28 21:39:24 If you honk at me .05 seconds after the traffic light turns green, ima put my car in park, adjust my seat, check the pressure on my tires, have an oil change, read a book, shiii I might have dinner and throw in a nap.
1768 2018-11-28 21:39:21 Yes. The Snake Oil tanker (the bad guys boss's vehicle) lifted up to reveal a huge cannon with some sort of nuclear looking missile (for example). That was my first ever one I got for Christmas 
1769 2018-11-28 21:39:15 oil is just food lube
1770 2018-11-28 21:39:10 Be sure to continue your intellectual cowardice and block me.  BTW the reason high oil prices are good for Canada is because our oil is expensive to get out of the ground.  If oil is low, it costs money to get out of ground.  Informed people know that.
1771 2018-11-28 21:39:04 Regular cooked noodles with olive oil, complete seasoning, and Italian herbs with a little bit of cheese is the best and easy to make! See also: you can add tomatoes to this recipe as well as avocado for a pasta salad alternative.
1772 2018-11-28 21:39:03 Solar and wind are not powering millions of cars, and even if we did it would not make a dent in the price of crude oil, since our power plants are powered by natural gas and coal
1773 2018-11-28 21:39:02 Baby oil!
1774 2018-11-28 21:38:46 Yea but that involves me laying on the floor. Getting oil on my hands. Who do you think I am alonso?
1775 2018-11-28 21:38:43 I like excessively glossy skin. Well, less gloss looks more realistic, but when I see how even regular fashion models get soaked in baby oil, I think it's fine to use this look for R-18 stuff. I might make it look more like sweat than oil in the future. Needs to be seen.
1776 2018-11-28 21:38:40 Hope Kanu assertion is not true or else Great Britain will tell the world how tons of crude oil collected to cover up the conspiracy.
1777 2018-11-28 21:38:32 I still don't know why people it there. The couple times I did years before it came out they were anti-LGBTI the chicken was so shitty. It just tasted like nasty peanuts and the oil dripped out of the sandwich in huge amounts.
1778 2018-11-28 21:38:26 @SenBobCasey RE-election CONGRATS- Please ANSWER 2 QUESTIONS: 1) With DIRE Gov report on climate WHY are we STILL giving OIL Comps HUGE TAX BREAKS?  2) Why DEMs NOT providing alternatives to WALL like DRONES to monitor/track illegals at border: MORE EFFECTIVE & fraction of  COST?
1779 2018-11-28 21:38:18 How did that happen? He shut down every oil rig in the water, everywhere! WOULD NOT, WOULD NOT allow the Keystone pipeline, whether that has direct help for us or not.  Coal mines shut down,Hillary told ppl in W Va to move!? What an wishful man. Jealousy abounds in him!
1780 2018-11-28 21:38:16 When I've bleached my hair recently, I've been putting coconut oil in it first (saw it online somewhere) and it's drastically helped with how damaging bleach can be. 
I've had to double process (bleach more than once) lately to get out the color and it helps a lot!
1781 2018-11-28 21:38:12 I'll take 3 bottles of Snake Oil. Thank you.
1782 2018-11-28 21:38:11 Yal I just did a coffee and coconut oil scrub on my face..... that was the perfect scrub for this weather a bitch is glowing
1783 2018-11-28 21:38:09 Is this the same government that can only talk about oil? Your commercial is sappy and stupid!
1784 2018-11-28 21:38:06 I need to get my oil changed REALLY  bad, but I'm going to wait until my dad gives in and does it for me (:
1785 2018-11-28 21:38:05 Tastes like battery acid mixed with used car oil
1786 2018-11-28 21:38:05 Baby oil gal, works a treat
1787 2018-11-28 21:38:03 Nonsense ,since the oil prices has been high ,have they come to announce it as they are doing now ,that it's low, my prayer it's that God shld dry dis oil ,that has been a curse to us  rather than blessing
1788 2018-11-28 21:38:03 People have short memories. In the 70's and early 80's, they were teaching kids about the coming Ice Age that was going to kill everyone.
Then it was....."Peak Oil!" that you don't even hear about anymore.
Now it's Global Warmi....."Climate Change".
Enviro Science major here, btw

Never ever had previous Pres.acted like this
1792 2018-11-28 21:37:50 My car needed oil so badly that I'm had to put in coolant as well. Bad Grease monkey.
1793 2018-11-28 21:37:48 Ez. Get oil and filter. Drain old oil change old filter. Use new oil and filter. BAM! Oh and the steps in between
1794 2018-11-28 21:37:46 Agree with you. Only vital issue - oil. The reliance on dirty energy has stymied innovation in clean renewable energy in the US. We are left behind due to a President and a Republican Congress steeped in greed.
1795 2018-11-28 21:37:45 I read through the sheet picture of the history of this product and its many uses. Fascinating! We are starting to plan our UK visit and third little shop will have to be Odin pour lists of things to see.  Wil have to check and see if the oil is something I can legally bein back
1796 2018-11-28 21:37:43 We do produce gas and the gas to oil ratio is much higher
1797 2018-11-28 21:37:41 A couple of reasons for Great Horn:  1)  The NDP suggested it; 2) The designation would make it harder for them to profit from it. 3) Kenney is like Harper - he hates anything that might stand in the way of oil company profits.
1798 2018-11-28 21:37:38 This olive oil with the coconut oil in it is life bro! Got my fro looking and feeling amazing my nigga.
1799 2018-11-28 21:37:38 He needs to be reminded that he CAUSED the Deepwater Horizon disaster by NOT allowing drilling in shallow water! He's responsible for the worst natural disaster in American history and he tries to take credit for oil?!
1800 2018-11-28 21:37:36 What Old Snake Oil Salesman Sanders doesn't tell about this story is he was inside the Station House less than 2 hours. It's what's called a " Walk Thru ".
1801 2018-11-28 21:37:30 If you actually knew anything about Venezuela, you would know that their economy was destroyed by sanctions, corruption and most of all the rapid price drop of oil which is what their economy rely's on. Anyways you're a DA clown and you rely on eNCA and News 24 to know anything
1802 2018-11-28 21:37:23 Scheer, your party was in power for years and did NOTHING for the oil industry.  Conservatives are like Trump, ALL TALK.
1803 2018-11-28 21:37:21 What do you wash/condition with? How often are you using that oil?
1804 2018-11-28 21:37:06 Got to be when they ask the guy on the oil rig for directions...

1809 2018-11-28 21:37:00 My daughter is gluten intolerant and always has to check if chips are gluten free, the oil they are cooked in may have had sausages, battered fish, nuggets fried in it. Chips have made her extremely ill before because of this.

1813 2018-11-28 21:36:47 How about asking some questions about the price differential between the bitumen and other oil? Also ask her about the oil companies who are making money as they refine in AB. Don’t just tweet out Notley’s misinformation.

1819 2018-11-28 21:35:40 Obama taking credit for low oil prices is like Stalin taking credit for freedom.
1820 2018-11-28 21:35:39 LMFAO. Trump deregulated the shit out of that industry and it led to rigs in the ocean and a massive uptick in exporting crude. But yeah, thank this clown who clamped down on the oil industry as hard as he could. I couldnt roll my eyes any harder.
1821 2018-11-28 21:35:36 bit staged and fake.
1822 2018-11-28 21:35:29 And there is presently an oil glut.
1823 2018-11-28 21:35:27 What about all the oil jobs lost in Texas and North Dakota years after President Bush 45 was in office? Obama would blame Bush, of course.  Markets turn on a dime and Obama is a clown.

He has been tweeting about his accomplishment on lower oil prices, pressuring Saudis to not cut production for months now.

Saudis, like Powell, would cave in? Not sure about that..
1831 2018-11-28 21:34:54 @RachelNotley Do we have the authority, willingness or capacity to limit/prevent Equalization Payments? If the FedGov cannot help AB, I’m sure keeping our money here, invested here & helping Albertans instead of helping those who keep our hands shackled with respect to our oil?
1832 2018-11-28 21:34:54 Not for all of 2017, no.  January 20, 2009 – January 20, 2017.  Forgive me for only referencing the years...

Regardless of any regulations, oil production clearly increased overall throughout his presidency.  Unless that chart I posted is wrong?

1839 2018-11-28 21:34:27 When oil and gas prices were high. Most of the large energy companies were leveraging government incentives to invest in and explore newer energies. When prices tanked in 2014, those new divisions became unfortunate causalities as none-core assets were disposed to stay afloat
1840 2018-11-28 21:34:17 Pretty incredible
Everybody freaking out on their debt..like if oil is going to $30 for the next 5 years...
A lot of companies will go under before them

1842 2018-11-28 21:34:14 What a fool searching for a legacy. Oil production spiked because of fracking and in spite of Obama.

1864 2018-11-28 21:32:29 When I made such a salsa, I did so thusly:
- Rinsed and halved tomatillos

- Blend in a food processor with veggie stock and a couple spoons of adobo sauce from a can of chipotles
- BOOM

1875 2018-11-28 21:31:47 Yes because making all the Alaska andoffshore oil drilling illegal really help to increase production
1876 2018-11-28 21:31:45 Build a refinery in Oshawa. And a big juicy pipeline right to it for all that lovely Alberta oil!!!!

1878 2018-11-28 21:31:44 Obama is delusional. But most people will believe him because they won’t remember (or didn’t care to know) how hard he fought against oil production.

1881 2018-11-28 21:31:32 No matter how many pipelines you build, the oilsands are not profitable and not viable, unless WTI crude oil reaches $66.
1882 2018-11-28 21:31:28 LoL I've given up on rational anything.
It's worth noting that Irrationality is High these days, I think i just made up a new index. 

On the bright side, Oil went lower and the equity market didn't blink!
1883 2018-11-28 21:31:23 Regardless of the NEP and whatever people think of it, it had nothing to do with the economic crash at the time. That was yet another “oh shit, oil prices crashed, let’s blame the feds” scenario. False correlation by crooked con artists and you bought it, hook, line and sinker.
1884 2018-11-28 21:31:18 Just because Obama put ChapStick back on the map with his world wide ass kissing tour , he thinks it qualifies as oil production 
1885 2018-11-28 21:31:16 Dovish Powell = long oil

1901 2018-11-28 21:30:20 And is that what the citizens of Alberta need?  That same oil industry has saddled tax payers with $249 Billion in liabilities, air quality that can't meet WHO standards in many places and millions of litres of toxic sludge with cancer causing chemicals leaking into our rivers.
1902 2018-11-28 21:30:19 If only he could some how pump up the oil price
1903 2018-11-28 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1904 2018-11-28 21:30:09 Where’s the cardboard and motor oil?
1905 2018-11-28 21:30:09 It irks that they support the oil agenda under cover of bipartisanship.
1906 2018-11-28 21:30:08 Beautiful! I'd like to turn that photo into an oil painting!
1907 2018-11-28 21:30:07 He was the best manager PSG has had ever since oil money came into play. Played brilliant football not this rubbish I see today.
1908 2018-11-28 21:30:06 i guess but the semantics really matter here. Especially since "Data" (not "estimates") are allegedly the new oil.
1909 2018-11-28 21:30:05 It’s probably time for an oil change.
1910 2018-11-28 21:29:57 Does anybody know how to change oil? #ncat #uncg
1911 2018-11-28 21:29:53 1) he wasnt president in 2017.

2) outside of that, the man did everything in his power to hamper drilling in Alaska, in the gulf, and so on throughout his presidency. He put environmental regulations on fracking and other means to produce oil.
1912 2018-11-28 21:29:45 Ok - I think environmental movement is impotent/ineffective even in narrow scope of pipeline opposition (& west or south pipelines don't change East importing oil from wherever it comes from)
We don't have a 'domestic first' policy for oil because in past that didn't benefit AB
1913 2018-11-28 21:29:42 How far with Muzarabani oil?
1914 2018-11-28 21:29:35 Just declass it all,throw it to the wind!  How's about that?
Talking about your oil boiling will be more than that!  WE THE PEOPLE
1915 2018-11-28 21:29:33 Im nosing on the Ukog facebook group and someone just asked
who the bloke is with the glasses ? 
1916 2018-11-28 21:29:32 But but....they’re offering us cheap oil :(
1917 2018-11-28 21:29:31 Try the oil producers did it with phoney regulations off their backs.
1918 2018-11-28 21:29:31 In the meantime i’m going to use some body shop natural tea tree oil on them 
1919 2018-11-28 21:29:15 I've watched this for 30 yrs. It's almost like DC is conspiring among themselves to always have a majority to resist common sense reform. It's always just barely out of reach.
1920 2018-11-28 21:29:14 #TrumpValue: "[An] oil portrait of Donald Trump by “speed painter” Michael Israel purchased by the foundation for $10,000 at a charity fundraiser auction ... after [Melania] won the auction was valued at $700 at the beginning of the year but dropped to zero by the end of 2017."
1921 2018-11-28 21:29:09 You are throwing that old fossil of the oil is going to run out, oh and there is another find and nope not going to run out in 10 years the problem has gone away again. Give us all a break on that one.
1922 2018-11-28 21:29:00 Don’t be fooled by the commercials, it’s motor oil.
1923 2018-11-28 21:28:59 PSG fans singing "We love oil". I bet you do.

1924 2018-11-28 21:28:56 I took my car to get an oil change, I’m finally an adult
1925 2018-11-28 21:28:56 I only use hot water to wash my hair, no detergent or soap. Sometimes I'll add peppermint essential oil to it. Thanks for the tip about cayenne, 
1926 2018-11-28 21:28:50 With today melt out,now trump has more bullets to “fight china”.China will slow down more ...n hence crude oil...?
1927 2018-11-28 21:28:49 I think he's right, the question is, who's reality is closer to Reality? Example from today's news: #Obama's statement that he should be thanked for U.S. becoming largest oil producing nation... If #Trump had said something so preposterous you'd be all over him. Which is reality?
1928 2018-11-28 21:28:45 Didn't fool me ..US politicians are whores for war, greed, oil, and Israel.  Nothing will change until we, the people, burn it to the ground.
1929 2018-11-28 21:28:32 What an idiot !! We don't need Saudi money or oil. Using fear monger as deterrent .. sanctions must be imposed immediately. Especially with a potus who believes a cold blood killer instead of own CIA
1930 2018-11-28 21:28:32 Motor oil 
1931 2018-11-28 21:28:31 That reminds me I didn't put any oil in my hair today  I gotta do better.
1932 2018-11-28 21:28:31 These days everybody wants green energy. What’s greener than water falling over a rock??? If the government spent the same amount on oil then you fuckers would be all hating on that.
1933 2018-11-28 21:28:30 Classically, you covered them boys in baby oil to bring out the definition in their muscles. HD Cameras came around, they looked like boys covered in baby oil, so now it's mostly just long hair boys with real gross conditioner mix that look oily in wrestling, but it's 4 the hair.
1934 2018-11-28 21:28:24 This peppermint oil. 
1935 2018-11-28 21:28:20 LOL USELESS TEAM.
1936 2018-11-28 21:28:16 Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. There IS a better way. Go home today, build a kinetic capture fed generator, and begin your role in putting the psychopathic oil and gas industry out of business. Use its only byproduct, hydrogen, to fuel your converted car.
1937 2018-11-28 21:28:14 Alan you my friend are wrong. We are now # oil producer and coal producer in the world. Thats how it should be. Buying crap from everyone else. Killing our jobs. Making us weaker n regulating ouselves to death is expansive.
1938 2018-11-28 21:28:06 Another major factor is US production is primarily fracking based, which is only cost effective if oil is above a certain price per barrel. A few years ago oil was so low a lot of US production stopped.
1939 2018-11-28 21:28:04 It's a uphill battle friends. Uphill battle to fight to save our planet. I can't believe science has taken this turn for polictics and short term gains for oil moguls.  If you're meteorologist like me, you're living in the toughest times. Keep strong! #ClimateChangeIsREAL

1941 2018-11-28 21:27:46 Wow!  Really incredible he is not being held accountable for his lies. He must have failed Solyndra and waste of taxpayer money confused with oil production.  He vetoed every oil and pipeline project!  Just incredible!
1942 2018-11-28 21:27:45 李苑さんも一等出したい(  ´ ꒳ ` )
1943 2018-11-28 21:27:45 Thanks.
Majority is private, but gas on fed +  Indian territory land especially may contain 1/5 of the nation’s oil, gas + vast coal reserve and was reported in decline ‘15. 
Tribes have rights, drill, but don’t own—-Another story.
1944 2018-11-28 21:27:41 I think @POTUS44 also put the oil in the ground (he's responsible for the reserves). Thank you.
1945 2018-11-28 21:27:39 ThaNks for the response.  Can you clarify which parts will not be allowing new oil and gas activity within the colored area?  Or correct me if I am misinterpreting this!  Thanks.
1946 2018-11-28 21:27:37 You don't see Democrats spitting on blue areas. Trump is spitting on the very red areas of oil production and farms by his actions.
1947 2018-11-28 21:27:35 But as @kris_sims would say... maybe: No money, no food.  So there.  Build that pipeline, it's a lot better than an oil train one derailment from blowing up in some rural community with no tribe, no big money!
1948 2018-11-28 21:27:19 Yup, kinda foolish to try to claim Obama increased domestic oil production when democrats have been screaming to shut it all down for decades.
1949 2018-11-28 21:27:16 From tough times in the oil patch...to a plant closure in the auto sector. Money Columnist @brucesellery has some ideas on how to prepare financially for the risk of losing your job.
1950 2018-11-28 21:27:09 Wait what!! So oil is not running out! So much so that we now need more employees to help pump it out of Scotland's seas!!
1951 2018-11-28 21:27:03 y’all i finally got my coconut oil
1952 2018-11-28 21:27:00 Ah so you dont want to talk about North sea oil anymore...resort to bitter anti english rhetoric
1953 2018-11-28 21:26:57 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1954 2018-11-28 21:26:56 He did everything he could to stifle the oil  industry this guys living in fantasy land
1955 2018-11-28 21:26:55 FYI the oil and gas industry is dying, time to look at a career change. If major car manufacturers switching to electric, and power grids switching to solar hasnt been enough of a clue, then I'm here to telll you it's time to leave that dying industry.
1956 2018-11-28 21:26:45 Let's get back to the Monroe Doctrine.  Take care and help build North America which includes our southern neighbors.  Let's also het out of the Middle East.  We are now the leading oil producer, and soon to be exporter.  We don't need to be there.
1957 2018-11-28 21:26:43 Obama tried to crush oil companies
1958 2018-11-28 21:26:41 For me, it depends on the recipe. I find coconut oil works well in home made granola or for popcorn or a brown sugar body scrub. I don’t use it for much else though.
1959 2018-11-28 21:26:40 Shocking.... Smh. who believes this snake oil salesman?  $tsla $tslaq
1960 2018-11-28 21:26:29 And 1 trillion cubic metres of gas, and the curse of all that oil.
1961 2018-11-28 21:26:29 Obama taking credit for booming US oil is akin to Mueller investigating a Russian lhing with @POTUS. Mueller was created at same time & Hillsry paid for it. One problem, @POTUS is not selling the lil odds & ends needed for ego building/illusions.
1962 2018-11-28 21:26:24 I know! Kids need to know about avocado toast, beard oil and ironically worn fedoras. Amiright?
1963 2018-11-28 21:26:18 roommate: hey have you been using my coconut oil?

me: oh yeah and totally for cooking..

roommate:

me: definitely not for masturbating.
1964 2018-11-28 21:26:17 Wow. So you would argue GDP has no correlation with oil prices in Canada?
1965 2018-11-28 21:26:15 .When #Saddam was cornered, he burned down his country (oil fields); When Saddam #Trump is cornered by Mueller & Dems, he’ll try to burn down America, starting w/ Congress, DOJ, & economy
1966 2018-11-28 21:26:11 An oil change shouldn't take 2 whole ass hours
1967 2018-11-28 21:26:11 "Obama Bin Lyin" again!  

"Barack Obama signed the Paris Climate Accord which would have obliterated the US oil industry."
1968 2018-11-28 21:26:06 That’s just insulting to our intelligence. He did everything in his power to stop oil production.
1969 2018-11-28 21:26:05 LogicOil is now on the Radio! We have partnered up with City TV and Rogers Media! Check us out on 660 AM News!
1970 2018-11-28 21:25:55 Bio oil does not work haha! At all! I’ve got nearly 5 weeks left and I know there’s more to come, gonna have to embrace it 
1971 2018-11-28 21:25:46 We get only ~10% of our oil from SA.  I think it's his real estate and weapons deals that he's worried about.
1972 2018-11-28 21:25:44 That’s rich odummy I know you said this country had only 10% the oil resources compared to Saudi you stopped oil production steeply you are a fraud!
1973 2018-11-28 21:25:43 That's great thank you. Are there plans to use the RSPO Trademark so everyone knows your products use the sustainably sourced palm oil?
1974 2018-11-28 21:25:28 addicted to coconut oil
1975 2018-11-28 21:25:17 Tell us the facts. I'm curious to know why your opinion is that the liberal government closed the oshawa plant and caused the oil and gas industry to decline.
1976 2018-11-28 21:25:14 If you want to hurt The Saudi government. Open all federal lands to drilling and subsidized the oil industry until oil is down to $25 a barrel, so I’m guessing your on board with that plan?
1977 2018-11-28 21:25:04 Reading all the Tate's controversies is an endurance test - the trustees that buy their own work, the donations from banks, oil companies and blavatniks, not joining the MLA scheme, etc etc. It's my least favourite London gallery.
1978 2018-11-28 21:24:59 i hate men who when u look at them u just know they own beard oil or some kind of beard kit
1979 2018-11-28 21:24:55 the two places were developed with the same oil money Nigeria keeps misappropriating and siphoning to individual pockets. Evil!
1980 2018-11-28 21:24:50 U need to visit Nigeria. There is still jungle justice here. No roads even in d big cities. I reside in d city with d richest deposit of oil and gas, yet no power for 3days now. General elections is around d corner and d criminals are promising haven on earth without a plan.
1981 2018-11-28 21:24:38 More fracking, more coal, more oil pipelines probably. It’s not the EPA it’s the anti-EPA. They should be charged with crimes against humanity.
1982 2018-11-28 21:24:28 New tires oil changed now BROKE 
1983 2018-11-28 21:24:17 Just look at Tesla for example, making life better while oil companies they don’t care about the environmental just money & greed but tht won’t matter when we’re dead. 
1984 2018-11-28 21:24:10 Strange, I remember his administration shutting down oil exploration and drilling....
1985 2018-11-28 21:24:07 しゅごぉぉぉぉぉい！！！
1986 2018-11-28 21:24:07 So I got a steam mop for my hardwood floors and tile, and I add some essential oil cleaner to it and I'm so obsessed. My whole house smells so fresh and clean... I've already steam mopped twice this week 
1987 2018-11-28 21:24:06 if Scotland was independent , do you think they will make it easy for the rest of the Uk to get it's oil, water, electricity,food?
1988 2018-11-28 21:24:04 Here I was reading MLP as Master Limited Partnerships.... you know for oil and energy concerns....
1989 2018-11-28 21:24:04 If Al Gore can be responsible for the internet then Barry can be responsible for oil!
1990 2018-11-28 21:23:57 Canada also buys Saudi oil and imports it on ships along the St. Lawrence seaway, why don't you speak out about that Ms. Mason?
1991 2018-11-28 21:23:53 Hello Jan, our spreads are not made with palm oil but are manufactured on a site which handles palm oil for other products. Hope that helps, Team Gü
1992 2018-11-28 21:23:45 The dude who tried to shove every other energy type down our throats? Wind mills,  solar, electric cars. Is now taking credit for oil production. I thought the sky was falling B.O. now you want credit.
1993 2018-11-28 21:23:42 Have any of Uactually listened 2the entire segment?
#44 was addressing the need 4energy independence in oil,nat.gas, wind &.
let’s see,how would energy independence help the?
1.Freedom from Middle East Oil 
2.Createjobs
3.Eliminate need 4military presence in certain areas
1994 2018-11-28 21:23:42 You bet! No to mention oil depletion allowances
1995 2018-11-28 21:23:41 We are expecting rain over the next couple of days. I need to get some more CBD oil for Penny if there is going to be thunder.  So that's what I'll be doing later.
1996 2018-11-28 21:23:30 He wasn’t laughing when he was told the Popeye olive oil joke on minute to win it last week

1998 2018-11-28 21:23:27 
1999 2018-11-28 21:23:19 my grandmother is so precious. she makes little essential oil roller balls for me and my family and i found out a few days ago that she prays over every single one that she makes. 
i don’t deserve her.
2000 2018-11-28 21:23:11 hmm, an avocado in orange color? The gear needs oil then.
2001 2018-11-28 21:23:11 He does. You might want to check your holy oil supply. You have threatened to “fry ourselves an archangel.”
2002 2018-11-28 21:23:07 I agree. it is no better than a spoiled child throwing a tantrum and a bully because they are not getting what they want. #Alberta's behavior is the reason why I do not respect them anymore. They have no right to destroy Canada with dirty oil. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
2003 2018-11-28 21:23:07 Obama you fought against the NA Oil Pipeline for years!! Trump approved Pipeline on day ONE of @POTUS Presidency..O fake President Obama.
2004 2018-11-28 21:22:58 All my maintenance is free too. So Idk why shit be taking 50 years. Its a damn oil change!
2005 2018-11-28 21:22:57 Did Obama's suddenly turn into oil?
2006 2018-11-28 21:22:50 He is a walking talking turd . He wanted to shut down coal mining, the oil pipeline and offshore drilling. Yeah he takes credit for all of those things. @realDonaldTrump
2007 2018-11-28 21:22:47 Well DiFi, if you have a mountain of evidence like you had with Ford's accusations of Justice Kavanaugh, why haven't you simply stopped the recovery of oil in CA via the injection of rare and precious CA water? Oh, I forgot those oil folks pour millions in you pockets.
2008 2018-11-28 21:22:45 I am sorry to say but until inventories stop going up it is going to be this inferno of everyone trying to hit oil lower.
2009 2018-11-28 21:22:39 Yes even if the pipeline was approved today it would be3 years before oil will flow
2010 2018-11-28 21:22:29 Oil 
2011 2018-11-28 21:22:28 Growing up I remember one winter night having to stay with relatives because my mom couldn't afford to fill the oil tank. I appreciate what I have every day.
2012 2018-11-28 21:22:27 I had no idea coconut oil gets the garlic smell off of your fingers and I will now have to try that. 

Thanks @antoni!
2013 2018-11-28 21:22:24 cc: stolen oil
2014 2018-11-28 21:22:08 That's not the focus. My point is that we have to look at these issues through a multifaceted lens, one where we understand the impacts of different positions. If we don't want to have the oil sands, fine. But let's be real about the tradeoffs in  geopolitics #onpoli #abpoli
2015 2018-11-28 21:22:03 Oh yes!! I know exactly where we are with oil prices...and I can tell you we are nowhere near 134 dollars but $55 is an improvement but Scotland wouldve had four years of hell if theyd voted indy
2016 2018-11-28 21:21:57 I like coconut oil for roasting veggies and as a oil for salad. I even slather myself and kids with it during the winter. Canola oil is my go to though for everything. Cook, bake, roast, the odd fry. Great, light versatile oil that’s heart friendly 
2017 2018-11-28 21:21:53 Sugar and palm oil. Might be some cocoa solids in there too. Might.
2018 2018-11-28 21:21:50 @Ford I recently learned that the VHR was discontinued. Two questions, will other things work, like the low tire pressure light? And what is the change oil schedule? My book says to go by the VHR, now discontinued. I have a 2014 Escape.
2019 2018-11-28 21:21:34 I lived in Oklahoma City for 8 years. OKC was...OK at best. Tulsa is a smaller hub of culture - big range of music and arts. They relied on natural gas and oil $ for years, but HQs for these companies moved to places like Houston. Really a place to consider for this type of deal.
2020 2018-11-28 21:21:28 Sad that this creep did everything in his power to shut down US oil production. The Pipelines, Anwar, Paris Climate Accord...He thinks we're stupid. I'm speechless. This guy is breathtakingly dishonest....Correction, a LIAR!
2021 2018-11-28 21:21:27 Yeman suffering from the houthe who killing and stealing our people there and the Saudi governments are helping to stop these people and they gives food , medicine, money and oil for people of yeman
2022 2018-11-28 21:21:27 That's for sure Cath. The new methane cost we are going to put on in the new year to really stick it too the oil and gas industry. 
If we don't get our Carbon under control amd life ends in 2030 will it end at 1230 in Newfoundland cause that is their constitutional right?
2023 2018-11-28 21:21:24 have only seen them against City, but knew they would be a handful and they were... maybe this year's Watford... I'm a City fan, but i came by it honest..I'm an Oasis fan, and all of band root them on... I'm not an oil money plastic,, i promise...

We can’t sacrifice our farmers ONLY way to export grain, so oil and gas can overhaul grain export. Perhaps force some more tankers through so you can get more rev from C tax. Food for 
2026 2018-11-28 21:21:10 Our trader Anthony will be watching $oil like a hawk in the overnight.

2027 2018-11-28 21:20:59 I am grumpy because you are by far not the first person to to give broad sweeping endorsement of CBD oil.I get your optimism but kinda burned on that whole approach that is used by the very same people that have taken away mine & my 23 y/o disabled daughter's right to pain relief
2028 2018-11-28 21:20:49  plis where's the oil money?
2029 2018-11-28 21:20:42 Amazing. Speaks with forked tongue. He wanted to eliminate oil production in US and everywhere.
2030 2018-11-28 21:20:42 Too much oil..
2031 2018-11-28 21:20:38 Did not read every comment  but wonder if everyone on the committee should not take $ from ANY energy related sources, not just oil and gas.  Too much greenwashing, not to mention coal and nuke, possible otherwise. #ClimateChangeIsReal
2032 2018-11-28 21:20:35 yeah. also, this is heretical to many, but i don't love my mint and chocolate together. same my garlic and butter/oil. too rich or something.

why not mini-cheesecake buttons but simpler?
2033 2018-11-28 21:20:31 no its about fish oil
2034 2018-11-28 21:20:28 Those words do not mean what you think they do @BarackObama . So you take boast about your climate change record and then take credit for an oil boom? How contradictory of you Mr. Ex President
2035 2018-11-28 21:20:24 Texas will be #2 in 2019 so...... 
Yeah.. he should take credit.. his mantra was get off foreign oil
2036 2018-11-28 21:20:13 Surge happened dispite your admin policies....the vast majority of the increase in U.S. oil production occurred on private land, shale production you and your admin had nothing to do with #lyingObama
2037 2018-11-28 21:20:13 Why would rUK refuse to trade with either an independent Scotland or a Scotland which is part of the EU? Don't they want whisky, salmon, oil, and a place to keep their submarines?
2038 2018-11-28 21:20:10 Doug Ford actually thinks that he has influence on the global oil markets... he must have shown those OPEC members his Open For Business signs!
2039 2018-11-28 21:20:05 We talk about the government sector able to pay it. What of the private sectors. How much will bankers make, managers, executives, other business positions ? Those in oil industries? Doctors and nurses ? Do you analysis the financial pressure that will be on private firms?
2040 2018-11-28 21:20:05 It's matter of land. Conflict will arise  in relation to crude oil.
2041 2018-11-28 21:20:02 Kenya Pipeline keeps oil marketers in dark over loss of 23m litres of fuel

2045 2018-11-28 21:19:53 O is a liar: the oil surge began on privately owned property, outside of O's edicts and control.
2046 2018-11-28 21:19:49 Free oil for the rest of his life I'm thinking $$$

2048 2018-11-28 21:19:36 Has nothing till do with home or away. It's about oil.
2049 2018-11-28 21:19:33 @BarackObama 1st the fact you are running around doing what ex prez dont do is disgusting. 2nd you are so full of yourself its always I I I me me me. Our country was horrible under you and stagnant you have balls trying to take credit for the economy & oil FO
2050 2018-11-28 21:19:24 Here's what you have to do.
Try to get a meeting with @realDonaldTrump He's a good guy and he's OK with oil industry. Remember what he did for the XL pipeline in his 1st days in office? Stop being afraid of being a real Conservative-kissing JT's bum will make you a loser in 2019.
2051 2018-11-28 21:19:24 Again. In 2009 the economy was so bad there was no where to put money raised  by Wall Street. The oil business provided ROR and Obama didn’t know or care. The industry spent the cash and Obama woke up to increased petrochemical exports. He is a idiot. His EPA tried to intervene
2052 2018-11-28 21:19:23 2018 is almost over, and oil still hasn't run out yet.
2053 2018-11-28 21:19:22 How exactly will Alberta cutting production raise the world oil price?
2054 2018-11-28 21:19:14 Try slicing the plantain thinly and put it in the oil when it’s boiling hot...crunchy and spicy stuff 
2055 2018-11-28 21:19:10 I just bought a cool new shirt ABC’s Lost was a secret documentary! It’s all true! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2056 2018-11-28 21:19:10 ...but he was against big oil!?!
2057 2018-11-28 21:19:07 Has this ref received a donation in oil money? Someone should check his recent bank transactions.
2058 2018-11-28 21:19:06 Obama is no longer living in the same universe the rest of us are. Our economy is a direct result of ENDING all of his policies and mandates, especially those dealing with gas and oil.
2059 2018-11-28 21:19:06 You might love your pet, but do you love your pets enough to rub coconut oil on their cock??
2060 2018-11-28 21:19:06 These are all Republicans? Why do you think any of them will lift a finger to protect our air and waters?  They do what Trump and their corporate donors (oil/gas/chemical/KochBros) want, period.
2061 2018-11-28 21:19:05 What am I thankful for? My home, friends, family, food, my truck, relationship with the Universe, coffee, even a couple smokes, some weed, possessions, money, my health, cbd oil, my dog, of course my Mom, doctors, everything:) to have a working penis:)  #blessed
2062 2018-11-28 21:19:05 CBD oil is great I used it for a muscle relaxer along with help for sleep. I found once you get the right dose its perfect.
2063 2018-11-28 21:19:00 Can you show me where I blamed trump? I literally said oil companies. Not specific to a country or a person. But it seems you’re trying to blame india and China.. yet you just said you don’t believe man is causing global warming... which is it?
2064 2018-11-28 21:18:56 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
2065 2018-11-28 21:18:55 Here’s an idea: sell the oil to people who are buying it anyway, use the profits to develop cleaner technology.  A far better plan than choke Canadian industry and export profits to Saudi Arabia so we can tell ourselves that we saved the dolphins.
2066 2018-11-28 21:18:32 "Hi, I'm term oil cancer and you're watching Disney channel" -@_rylanhumphrey_
2067 2018-11-28 21:18:28 Dude I swear you are in my head sometimes. I had the hovercraft, oil rig, hydrofoil but I wanted that aircraft carrier sooo bad!!! I think I made one out of cardboard
2068 2018-11-28 21:18:18 My friends were comparing oils at a girls night and they were raving about coconut oil. When smoke points came up, I decided it was time to interject and point out canola oil has higher smoke point, is also healthy & is grown in Canada. Why buy more expensive coconut oil?
2069 2018-11-28 21:18:18 Good for you!!! Try different media...acrylic, oil, watercolor.  Wonderful!
2070 2018-11-28 21:18:15 I remember going on as a guest for a right-wing radio show in 2014 maybe and talking about how the Obama Administration was greenlighting offshore wells and oil fracking -- how it was pushing supply and how bad that was for the #climate -- I was right then and so is @POTUS44
2071 2018-11-28 21:18:13 Russian minister of energy said that they considering to use local currencies in trade with Iran and Turkey. They also consider to accept euro in oil transactions. One advantage of Russian nuclear arsenal.
2072 2018-11-28 21:18:11 motor oil nonsense
2073 2018-11-28 21:18:09  #PussyOTUS has wanted his hands on Mid-Eastern oil since the war in Iraq..maybe before.  He’s hungry for drilling in the Antarctic with Putin for oil #Rosneft  That’s why he will #TakeAKnee for Putin and the Saudi Prince. #BloodForOil
2074 2018-11-28 21:18:01 Same here in Nigeria. Don't know if there's a curse on oil producing third world countries.
2075 2018-11-28 21:17:55 I wonder what agreements were made with Saudi Arabia to supply Ontario with Saudi Arabian oil and stopping western Canadian oil from flowing east. Merry Christmas Justine - a chip off the old block!
2076 2018-11-28 21:17:53 The ref getting some oil money after The match !!!!!
2077 2018-11-28 21:17:53 This referee has taken some oil money here.
2078 2018-11-28 21:17:51 @kenjilopezalt when we're talking about pizza dough, why is olive oil not a problem considering we cook the dough at 550?
2079 2018-11-28 21:17:49 You are probably aware that #ON along with #BC are among the worst offenders of inter provincial trade when in comes to #beer. #AB is the best.

Blocking BC wine was in response to a BC led effort to obstruct the oil trade. It sheds  light on which prov really cares about trade.
2080 2018-11-28 21:17:48 How much free oil is this ref getting for not giving Liverpool decisions 
2081 2018-11-28 21:17:43 Went to my dad's house because I wanted to steal cooking oil, took everything but cooking oil 
2082 2018-11-28 21:17:35 And they should be entirely  eliminated as well. Probably the only smart thing Trudeau’s done since being elected has been to cut tax credits to oil business. Corporate welfare doesn’t benefit anyone.
2083 2018-11-28 21:17:27 I filled my car with oil today and thought about pancakes.
2084 2018-11-28 21:17:13 And nothead standing in the background. Can people be that naive to think that they're way of life won't change or would be better with no oil and gas?
2085 2018-11-28 21:17:12 I love when I read ITG top shelf articles and see oil sheen and eco styler in the black girl’s cupboards
2086 2018-11-28 21:16:55 I can send you a lot of articles stating that oil companies are responsible for the vast majority of pollution in the world... let me guess you’ll dismiss all of those as lies?
2087 2018-11-28 21:16:54 Coconut oil and ya fingers in the shower is a great way to stretch your asshole.
2088 2018-11-28 21:16:47 US Closing prices: #DOW 2.50% #NASDAQ 3.17% #Ftse100 -0.18% #GBPUSD 1.2828 #EURGBP 0.8862 #EURUSD 1.1369 #Gold -0.26% #Oil 0.22%
2089 2018-11-28 21:16:39 Immediately block for sending stupid shit like this
2090 2018-11-28 21:16:38 Oh... that brought back memories of my mother giving me cod liver oil as a child. *gag reflex*.
2091 2018-11-28 21:16:38 What a liar!  Oil drilling dropped during his administration
2092 2018-11-28 21:16:36 Y’all ever used oil when y’all was fucking like frfr
2093 2018-11-28 21:16:36 Fish Oil pills 
2094 2018-11-28 21:16:27 Oil rig
2095 2018-11-28 21:16:26 So you have not seen the rise in oil prices?
2096 2018-11-28 21:16:19 Nana 5 likes don gather oooo...
2097 2018-11-28 21:16:11 Check your Engine oil today.
2098 2018-11-28 21:16:01 Market forces dictate the price of oil, no matter what labels #UCPCPC ascribe to Premier Notley or PMJT. Kenney will fare no better. #BitumenKoolaide
2099 2018-11-28 21:15:52 I hate PSG. Horrible players. Horrible Oil Money Club.
2100 2018-11-28 21:15:47 Mine hated the leave in too but I started mixing hemp oil with it and it completely changed how it felt on my hair. 
I leave a tab bit of my regular conditioner on my hair too before I do my protective styles as well.
2101 2018-11-28 21:15:45 TBH what inspired me to show you all how to make a DIY CBD oil Sugar scrub was the @JeffreeStar Cosmetics Sugar Scrub!! 

Should Jeffree Star add a CBD oil option to his sugar scrub line?? What do you think? He did Approve the @milkmakeup Kush mascara - which is CBD infused 
2102 2018-11-28 21:15:35 He said we need American energy production...
which included oil drilling/harvesting.
Your cherry picking is quite hilarious.

2103 2018-11-28 21:15:35 Makes sense. Has nothing to do with  President Maduro corruption or Suspension of constitutional rights or failing oil prices and an embargo. Hate to have facts and be wrong 
2104 2018-11-28 21:15:35 299$ for break pads then i gotta do my filter and oil. I can just imagine the bill 
2105 2018-11-28 21:15:35 Ok, so the Chinese still have filthy rivers, air that is unfit to breath, and have nothing but gutter oil to cook their food with.

Tbh genetically engineered perfect daughters/wives is an understandable but ultimately lame choice.
2106 2018-11-28 21:15:31 No it was extremely high grade CBD oil called Creating Better Days.I did my research. It helped my daughter for complaints of inflammation.But we shouldn't have to choose Governor Scott in Florida pushed through medical marijuana before sicking the DEA on Florida residents & Dr's
2107 2018-11-28 21:15:27 The oil industry has long received subsidies.
2108 2018-11-28 21:15:27 There's a PLETHORA for sure
You MUST get an oil pen too, for on the go purposes especially!
2109 2018-11-28 21:15:23 Oil has more different from that a hole; a form An ecological sense in support these fictions In Apocalypse Now and insightfulness.
2110 2018-11-28 21:15:03 Really because when I was working in the oil industry he was president we went from 40-60 hours a week to less than 30 hours a week and just now coming back to life
2111 2018-11-28 21:14:56 Major auto plant closing, oil industry being killed off slowly and Trudeau wants to bring in millions of unskilled mostly third world people into the country.  He has sold the country out  while taxing people to death with half baked BS and no relief in sight.  Traitor!
2112 2018-11-28 21:14:47 but i really only came in for a oil change and somehow needed all these other services.
2113 2018-11-28 21:14:39 ....oh brilliant...and then what in forty years?? Salmond based the entire scottish economy on oil remaining at $134 a barrell during 2014 indyref..it went down to $34 a barrell as Aberdeen will testify. The Scots economy wouldve been on the same poverty scale as Burkino faso
2114 2018-11-28 21:14:37 "The grooviest and nastiest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even cuddled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2115 2018-11-28 21:14:35 Can we add how oil prices are made to the Alberta school curriculum?
2116 2018-11-28 21:14:34 Nope olive oil is the only way I use olives, the texture makes me squeamish.
2117 2018-11-28 21:14:33 The discount on Canadian oil are facts of composition, extraction methodology, difficult geography, and CPC cancellation of Canadian Wheat Board causing logisitical nightmare. FAKE-CHRISTO-FASCIST-KOCH-OIL-SUCKER
2118 2018-11-28 21:14:30 You might want to read more. Most oil in the US is on private property. The oil production on federal land never grew under Obama at all because of all the regulations he put in place, but its grown leaps and bounds since Trump eased/did away with those regulations. #ThankTrump
2119 2018-11-28 21:14:21 Steam a whole pot of fresh kale. Then pour some olive oil over it, mix with salt/pepper/lemon juice. Get your greens in! You won’t regret this. Easily my favorite veggie right now with any meal.
2120 2018-11-28 21:14:19 Oil is the DNA left at today's crime scene. 
Gov continues to pick winners & losers Rosie.
2121 2018-11-28 21:14:18 How’s that money you’re making while dividing this great nation. Impeach Trump aka snake oil salesman now.
2122 2018-11-28 21:14:06 Agreed. This guy is bad news from all sides. Trump is arming him and eventually United States citizens will die by those weapons. Oil gives him power. That’s what we have to stop using.
2123 2018-11-28 21:14:06 Sorry for the countries that depends on oil prices to balance their budget. 

As your country is oil dependent other countries like US aren't. So they will always want lower oil prices. It's a matter of oil politics.
2124 2018-11-28 21:14:05 Yeah right. That’s why my husband (an offshore oil engineer) is working in Ghana producing oil instead of the US. Do note @BarackObama that my husband worked during thanksgiving. Hope u enjoyed YOUR turkey dinner.
2125 2018-11-28 21:13:59 This coming from the guy that heavily regulated the oil industry causing many jobs to be lost.
2126 2018-11-28 21:13:53 You must remember how much revenue is generated for the Canadian economy as a whole with regards to oil sales not just for Alberta, but for the country.
2127 2018-11-28 21:13:50 Yep... Claims that Trump unleashing the oil/coal reserves was all his doing.
2128 2018-11-28 21:13:50 Just wondering whats the cost of the rent at Lucus Oil and Indy11s former home?
2129 2018-11-28 21:13:49 This ref must be getting a free barrel of oil the cunt won’t blow his whistle for us and gives them everything
2130 2018-11-28 21:13:41 Someone tell the ref that there's oil money falling out of his back pocket. #LFC
2131 2018-11-28 21:13:37 Following up with additional hints to prep homes for winter:
•Fuel Supply – Be sure that you have oil or propane fuel.
•Windows – It’s a perfect time to check each and every window to make sure they are all closed and locked.
2132 2018-11-28 21:13:35 Must have been those 7 new states that hit oil....lol
2133 2018-11-28 21:13:32 What a lying narcissist! Obama did everything could to stop oil production in the US. Now he is taking credit for Trump’s deregulation of the industry? Balderdash!
2134 2018-11-28 21:13:32 Hahaha! What a farce! Venezuela has been under socialist rule for decades. in the 70s and 80s their presidents were from the Democratic Action party, a socialist party. Their economy crashed in the 80s when oil prices crashed, because 75% of their economy was based on oil.
2135 2018-11-28 21:13:27 @CatherineEm2016 I honestly feel for you every time I go get my oil changed. I’ll tell you one time in particular when a girl was sitting in front of everyone in the waiting room and was picking at her ingrown hairs on the backs of her thighs. Still grossed out n scarred for life
2136 2018-11-28 21:13:17 Oil companies like @suncorenergy making profits because they were proactive about pipelines/refinery. Others didn't do their due diligence. Smaller players will go bankrupt leaving liabilities to us; maybe even bigger companies. Thanks to Redwater decision, BIA we're stuck.
2137 2018-11-28 21:13:16 Absolutely! With olive oil brown meat & onion. Add white wine (ca. 1/2 cup)& let simmer on low or med heat. When pork is tender (1-2 hours) add sesame seeds, dried figs, & sea salt to taste. Cook for 15-20 mins & let stand for 20 mins before serving.  ENJOY!
2138 2018-11-28 21:13:07 Now Obama is taking credit for USA great oil production. This is laughable. The man that hates oil and coal and threw OUR money at alternative energy, I meant throwed away MONEY to prop up failing alternative energy companies.
2139 2018-11-28 21:13:06 You truly believe oil companies are responsible for the vast majority of pollution in the world? Do you drive? Do you use plastics, roadways, airlines, do you enjoy the protection afforded by our military, doctors, scientists that rely on those products?
2140 2018-11-28 21:13:05 Coal is dying, oil will soon follow, and then eventually natural gas. If that doesn't happen and happen quickly we are all very seriously screwed.
2141 2018-11-28 21:13:04 So my oil is on 5% & my windshield wipers are jacked up and make driving in the rain kinda scary 
2142 2018-11-28 21:13:03 What a joke he is.  It was by the oil industry based out of need.  He didnt do crap
2143 2018-11-28 21:13:00 I use maestro's beard butter. They sell it at target. I would rather put that on and rub it in. Its like lotion and blends in. Oil can make it a bit too oily for when you stroke your beard in mid thought
2144 2018-11-28 21:12:59 You know very well this is nothing but corruption. Oil, oil, oil.
2145 2018-11-28 21:12:59 I will explain my tweet as you completely missed the point: NDP did everything it could to kill the oil and gas industry and any pipeline project, on “environmental concern” pretexts, only now to advocate on an even worst solution for the environment, Albertans and Canadians.
2146 2018-11-28 21:12:59 I thought I would add some peppermint oil into my wax burner for a little extra Christmas cheer and I am currently unable to inhale
2147 2018-11-28 21:12:53 The reason Justin stopped western oil going eastward is simple - he didn't want western Canadian oil going through Saudi  country  ( Ontario )!
2148 2018-11-28 21:12:47 Global warming. Alberta is buying more rail cars to ship more cheap oil to the US so Americans can burn more oil cheaply. That oughta help!!
2149 2018-11-28 21:12:44 Grey 123 primer mate.    Then Eggshell colour matched oil based!
2150 2018-11-28 21:12:41 Investigate this referee immediately, he's definitely been handed some oil money on the dly
2151 2018-11-28 21:12:33 You are absolutely correct.  Furthermore, supply and demand almost has nothing to do with the price of oil.  If it did, oil prices would not move so wildly on a day to day and week to week basis!
2152 2018-11-28 21:12:15 Who would win in baby oil wrestling?
2153 2018-11-28 21:12:09 Just stoned thinking bout how much I love oil paints and how far I've come w them in a year
2154 2018-11-28 21:12:09 Kalo mau pake olive oil bersihinnya harus bener. Soalnya dia pores clogging gituu
2155 2018-11-28 21:12:04 In my opinion you are a snake oil salesman and making a circus out of this great nation. It’s time we clean up the White House and get rid of the clowns that live there. Impeach now! Wake up America!
@cnnbrk @FoxNews
2156 2018-11-28 21:12:03 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce American style Conservatism to Canada. It's is not news, it is propaganda.
2157 2018-11-28 21:12:02 Please ask him whether he wants more oil-by-rail along ecologically sensitive rivers and through our communities as well as increased numbers of foreign tankers in the Salish Sea because that is the real alternative to the pipeline. .
2158 2018-11-28 21:11:57 free oil changes, tire rotations and car wash
2159 2018-11-28 21:11:51 My midwife always recommends massages with olive oil bt lucky it doesnt bother me! Im not bothered bout much bt that strong sour body odour, salt n vinegar chips smell i jst want to projectile vomit all over the place LOL its too early for that 
2160 2018-11-28 21:11:51 My hair didn’t like the supercream 
Those should work. I use more oil and leave in conditioner than anything to lock in the moisture because that’s really what makes or breaks twistouts. Moisture is key.
2161 2018-11-28 21:11:47 Had a great day! Thx.  Sam   For yesterday’s crude oil session!    Waited for that 50.7 !   Road it down and back up
2162 2018-11-28 21:11:47 Shampoo/conditioner is great when it gets long. I'm not the biggest beard oil fan. Don't like the way it feels. Or haven't found a good one.
2163 2018-11-28 21:11:45 lol at Alberta for acting like their lives depend on shipping that daggone oil outta there, but really all our lives depend on not making all this oil. neat paradox.
2164 2018-11-28 21:11:43 @andrewcbc, you didn’t explain that only a fraction of Alberta oil is discounted.
2165 2018-11-28 21:11:41 I love the way Climate change Obonkers is taking credit for advancing Oil....the empire will give him a place to show what a Dumb A he really is. He was a big Solyndra Solar Failure Really he is just a Liar!
2166 2018-11-28 21:11:38 Here's a fun thing I did today, and you can do it too, if you have the internet!  Google two things: "Where does the US get oil" and "who does the US sell arms to."
2167 2018-11-28 21:11:38 Oil production during the Obama years was the highest in over 30 years. Steve like his boss, Trump, cannot tell the truth.
2168 2018-11-28 21:11:35 That is assuming we get a trade deal with rUK that's as good as the one we've got now which I doubt will happen, whats the current cost to the government of decommissioning an oil field because you'll have to factor that into the remaining £7bn?
2169 2018-11-28 21:11:24 If it’s indeed in Yuan, what stops SA from selling their oil in euro to the Europeans now? The dominos will fall fast.
2170 2018-11-28 21:11:23 Win Jan canola up A$0.69/t & EU rape down A$3.25. Oilseed futures all boosted by drop in US$, but A$ up and wiped out the gains. Expectations of a US interest rate rise have fallen. Soyoil & palm oil both up providing support for canola,
2171 2018-11-28 21:11:19 Big props to my 6th hour Freshman Sophomore Global Studies class for great presentations on a realistic oil crisis scenario oil vs clean energy.  True command and understanding of topic!  #teachmorris
2172 2018-11-28 21:11:14 By saying the great majority is your opinion not fact.The facts are there have been no real studies. Statements like your throw other #cpp under the bus because people are already being told CBD oil & product derived from cannibis are the answer to chronic pain & opioid addiction
2173 2018-11-28 21:11:13 when you stop using palm oil in all your products I'll consider it!
2174 2018-11-28 21:11:08 What happened to “you didn’t do that, you didn’t build those” or “If we opened up and drilled on every single square inch of our land and our shores, we would still find only 3% of the world's oil reserves — 3% for a country that uses 25% of the world's oil”
2175 2018-11-28 21:11:07 That's right. Isn't it...

1. Preservatives 
2. Palm Oil 
3. High Fructose Corn Syrup 
4. Processed Meat?
2176 2018-11-28 21:11:04 i use beard oil, butter, and shampoo. its a process
2177 2018-11-28 21:11:04 And my oil well on the end of Wigan pier will yield a million barrels of oil a day
2178 2018-11-28 21:11:00 Beto is owned by big oil & hedge fund managers. He has 1 single piece of legislation while a member of Congress. His voting record is Wall Street hell.
2179 2018-11-28 21:10:50 Was sent a video of someone frying a turkey 

You know how they prepared the bird? A dash of salt and pepper then into the oil. That whole bird and a SPRINKLE of salt, a fleck of pepper I don't need to talk about side dishes or sideshow president

I judge America based on this
2180 2018-11-28 21:10:44 Was this before or after he took personal credit for the growth of the oil industry that he tried to destroy?
2181 2018-11-28 21:10:44 I live in North East Texas, oil country, he had us in a recession when he left office. I have a small real estate company, there were hundreds of empty houses and no one was buying. Obama lies,
2182 2018-11-28 21:10:43 Not only will oil prices be a problem but the cheap stuff is gone. @OilGasCanada has the more expensive stuff to extract; without free water, no attention to liabilities and no polluter pay they wouldn't be able to be profitable. I'm guessing all political parties captive.
2183 2018-11-28 21:10:40 The best team oil can buy!
2184 2018-11-28 21:10:35 So what happens if I don’t get my oil changed 
2185 2018-11-28 21:10:33 Me in high school, reading about Spanish colonialism: 
Fucked up how the Church was used to justify rapacious exploitation and genocide. Now back to talking about how gays are an abomination & we should nuke the Middle East if they dont stop being terrorists and give us their oil
2186 2018-11-28 21:10:31 Cars and oil are the past.
2187 2018-11-28 21:10:21 it varies by state but the red ones like Texas do everything to strip employee rights in favor of businesses running around like tyrants. Like Oil Baron style
2188 2018-11-28 21:10:20 Solar power billionaires! Hahahahahahahahahaha. Did you ever, ever say the phrase oil giant billionaires?  Ever?
2189 2018-11-28 21:10:19 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
2190 2018-11-28 21:10:17 please someone hit a button on murkomen's brain so it can reset .

this kind of thinking is dragging us down... at this rate we may discover a new oil well soon
2191 2018-11-28 21:10:03 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
2192 2018-11-28 21:10:03 He must have been so busy making us largest oil producer, he had no time to car shop.
2193 2018-11-28 21:10:01 Interesting oil didn't rally today even with the weaker dollar.  Might have to see mid-40's?
2194 2018-11-28 21:09:59 Washington will step up pressure on Germany by using its bitch Ukraine poking the bear. Problem is Berlin has set its eyes on Nordstream2 and powerfull german olichargs calling the shots in Berlin will not waiver coz US oil and gas is too expensive.
2195 2018-11-28 21:09:57 Well look at the silver lining, the Abarth exhaust system could double as a fish smoker, just drop some wood chips in the exhaust system, and they'll run on almost any fuel, so maybe a little extra virgin olive oil? The Abarth Cincequento, the indispensible kitchen helper.
2196 2018-11-28 21:09:53 Great news! Sell our oil to our good friend.
2197 2018-11-28 21:09:49 oil will be a safe haven when equities take the biggest hit of the year v. shortly (pun intended)
2198 2018-11-28 21:09:49 Over 80% of the world's energy needs are provided by coal, oil and gas.
2199 2018-11-28 21:09:40 @BarackObama oil production may have increased during your term but were we #1?  No!!! With the leadership of @POTUS we are number one with a bullet. And @jack before you suspend me for making the "bullet" comment it was not a threat so chill.
2200 2018-11-28 21:09:34 The real question is is Justin paying market prices for Saudi oil while cutting off oil going to eastern Canada? Merry Christmas western Canada!
2201 2018-11-28 21:09:34 Mint oil in a spray can. Kills and protects. Nothing harmful to humans.
2202 2018-11-28 21:09:22 TN:  Worker died after being caught between oil rig and valve.
2203 2018-11-28 21:09:20 The "fair price" is being received. Tapcal Trust Fund PCs choose not to build refineries so oil being sold to USA companies that are refining and getting full value from our resources. Alberta had it's head up it's arse.
2204 2018-11-28 21:09:18 Yes and I'd come to live up there. With new oil reserves, the main fisheries and above all decent people. The independence campaign last time was when people believed we'd be in the EU. If we get out, watch investment dry up in Scotland and Wales (where turkeys voted for Xmas).
2205 2018-11-28 21:09:06 No oil train will be allowed in B C.
2206 2018-11-28 21:09:04 If they’re selling that oil in Yuan, I’ll have to include SA in my list of officially nonaligned countries. #Multipolarity
2207 2018-11-28 21:08:55 Oil oil oil.
2208 2018-11-28 21:08:55 @cenkuygur Im curious what u think of you're fav Obama taking credit for America being the largest Oil Producer when talk all the shit you do about Oil Companies in TX especially when you were happy about the Hurricane that destroyed a lot of oil fields in South TX! Thoughts?
2209 2018-11-28 21:08:53 It didn't help that oil, the primary driver of their economy went from $160 to $40...  Socialism certainly didn't help, but it wouldn't be intellectually honest to just blame socialism and ignore the main reason the economy collapsed.
2210 2018-11-28 21:08:50 You no go school? How can 'oil magnet' be an individual?
2211 2018-11-28 21:08:48 You think the same gov that is too inept, leaky, inefficient, and slow to regulate health insurance, enviro protections, oil, power, education, or business also runs a deep state, new-world-order conspiracy it's kept secret from 300m people for decades? Fool. #QAnon = #QuackAnon
2212 2018-11-28 21:08:48 No different than the uninformed agitated individuals who believe that Canada’s financial coffers can survive without the oil industry, that there is sufficient renewable resources to replace oil just because certain opportunistic politicians pretend they do,
2213 2018-11-28 21:08:46 Perhaps the toothpicks and vegetable oil are ok, as they don’t fundamentally change the product, or maybe the ad was for a cola
2214 2018-11-28 21:08:45 oil from countries with little environmental regulations and worse impacts to the environment so enjoy making a good change and helping the environment!  Oil sands propaganda is just that - based on baseless facts. Bye
2215 2018-11-28 21:08:42 Is anyone going to bother to ask him what he thinks he did to spur the Bakken oil boom (that occurred on non-federal land so he was unable to shut it down). Name ONE are he personally authorized new drilling in.
2216 2018-11-28 21:08:39 @The_Trump_Train is right. 
How dare GM not follow @realDonaldTrump 's SOCIALIST AGENDA and PAY WORKERS to make CARS no one buys.
He already subsidizes the steel, aluminum and oil industries as well as 0% INTEREST LOANS to BANKS.
2217 2018-11-28 21:08:34 I was today years old when I realized chili oil is literally oil with some chili flakes thrown in there-221 cals a tablespoon. I was taking it like water and throwing in half a cup in all my soups wow :/ someone lift this hex off me pleaE
2218 2018-11-28 21:08:32 Finally getting this oil change 
2219 2018-11-28 21:08:32 I’m ‘castor oil is fucking yuck!’ years old.
2220 2018-11-28 21:08:31 2. Heat butter or oil in a large saucepan. Steam the onions and the pumpkin. Spread flour and cream on it.
2221 2018-11-28 21:08:29 Always something wrong with my car  when I get a oil check up lol
2222 2018-11-28 21:08:27 FACT! His administration turned down and tried to stop as many permits as they could so Government drilling only decrease dramatically and private oil drilling kicked ass. It was in spite of his policies America was DRILLING BABY DRILLING! Lying bastard can't tell the truth ever.
2223 2018-11-28 21:08:27 99% of Alberta oil is sold to individual refineries in the US (meaning many individual customers).  The Gulf refineries still import 1mm bpd heavy from Venezuela, Mexico and Iraq because we can't ship enough to them which is why we face a huge discount .
2224 2018-11-28 21:08:22 Just about to everything. You do realise a new oil field has come on stream that is marked to last 40 years minimum
2225 2018-11-28 21:08:20 I am not 100% sure but I believe when we sign the new nafta that special oil price is not in it?
2226 2018-11-28 21:08:20 speed limits in the 70s was because of the oil embargo when the shah fell

as tech grew speed grew - - been out west in a while? 

insurance was because of banks wanting their collateral covered

cars is just a bad example - u seem to be to young to remember

a lot of things
2227 2018-11-28 21:08:14 My manager will tell u to put lavender oil on anything. Oil burn: lavender oil, stomach ache: lavender oil, broken leg: lavender oil.
2228 2018-11-28 21:07:52 I’m sorry but i can’t debate with someone who jumps from topic to topic and makes random blanket statements. my suggestion to you is not to be a hypocrite and cut oil out of your life - oh guess what you cant. Just so you’re aware if you’re not using AB oil you’re likely using...
2229 2018-11-28 21:07:51 Eco styler black castor and flaxseed oil
2230 2018-11-28 21:07:48 POS Barry couldn’t find oil in a gas station.
2231 2018-11-28 21:07:45 Nope. The oil makes me woozy.
2232 2018-11-28 21:07:27 Let's get this class started so I can go home and 'burn the midnight oil'
2233 2018-11-28 21:07:26 Beto Money Oil
2234 2018-11-28 21:07:26 Love my classic Acti-fry. Makes super crispy sweet potato fries, regular fries, spring rolls, gyoza, riblets, coconut shrimp, and salt and pepper wings. No added oil. Put in raw chicken wings and cook, them toss in individual bags of spices.
2235 2018-11-28 21:07:22 Matthieu, it was our pleasure to help bring your phenomenal book to the English-language market. (Now to see if we can get @DanielYergin to read it! )
2236 2018-11-28 21:07:17 So my car has been running pretty bad recently and I figured I would do an oil change and the dude I bought it from hopefully sees this... you uncultured fucking swine how dare you put regular oil on a engine that requires full synthetic omfg the oil was thick and disgusting
2237 2018-11-28 21:07:04 And what happens to jurisdictions that tie their success or failure to the future success or failure of oil & gas? #YYC
2238 2018-11-28 21:07:03 Best way to make a girl worry, have 4 guys do an oil change 
2239 2018-11-28 21:06:56 Some do, some don’t. The price is going to go into free fall soon when the US pipelines in TX come online. Our oil is what they use when there is not enough light sweet crude.
2240 2018-11-28 21:06:51 I love coconut oil, it’s like magic for everything. I got a huge jar of it at Sams & whenever I get out of the shower at night & have dry spots I always put it on and just rise it off before I go to bed!
2241 2018-11-28 21:06:19 That makes no sense if his party tried to prevent being the largest oil producer, they failed horribly lol. The US became the largest oil producer under Obama
2242 2018-11-28 21:06:17 wrong country
they have!...
err...
OIL!
no... HEROINE!
???
Al Qaeda
Yeh...
~We've been fighting in Afghanistan since I learned to walk~
2243 2018-11-28 21:05:59 แต่สนุกมึงมันแบบอะไรวะ ทำไมวะ เห้ยยยยยจิงดิ 5555555
2244 2018-11-28 21:05:54 Clove oil is a godsend.
2245 2018-11-28 21:05:44 Anyone else remember Crazy Frog? Cause I’m getting an oil change and that fuckin song came on giving me some mad nostalgia
2246 2018-11-28 21:05:42 US is trying every trick in the book to drive a wedge between Germany and Russia. The new trick is the Kerch Strait incident. Its all about Nordstream2 as Washington wants Germany to buy oil and gas from America and break ties with Russia.
2247 2018-11-28 21:05:38 And the blame still lies with oil companies, no one else! But, the Canadian taxpayers right across the country will pay the bill - as usual.
2248 2018-11-28 21:05:31 Motor oil and a bag of funyuns?
2249 2018-11-28 21:05:28 How many people were killed compared to, say, an oil rig exploding?
2250 2018-11-28 21:05:18 He'll say "listen friend, that was some beautiful despotic thuggery and murder you did. Seriously, well done. That said, it's not for the Russian cartel to pay your bills so let's get those oil prices backup quickly. Or else"  :famous Putin wink:
2251 2018-11-28 21:05:13 Obama wants to take credit for America becoming the world's largest oil producer. Fair enough. He  effectively took money out of brown people's mouths in the Middle East depending on that commodity for their economy. So fat Americans can gas up their SUVs. Well done ! #sarcasm
2252 2018-11-28 21:05:11 Leave in conditioner, oil of your choice, and some type of cream or custard. Works like a charm when I take my braids/twists down after wearing my wig. Definition be 
2253 2018-11-28 21:05:06 the next Special Herbs instrumentals album by MF DOOM will have the tracks all named after different kinds of CBD oil
2254 2018-11-28 21:04:56 In spite of Obama’s oil policies
2255 2018-11-28 21:04:49 Then get on with bypassong oil to new industry
2256 2018-11-28 21:04:48 It's the economy. Wish I could have predicted this, oh wait, I did.
2257 2018-11-28 21:04:48 True.  It’s amazing, though, how much new production of oil and gas is coming on line at the moment.
2258 2018-11-28 21:04:45 @JustinTrudeau you say news papers are going through a crisis. Our oil and gas industry is going through a REAL crisis and yet you do nothing..the personal hate for Alberta that you inherited from your father,  shows through clearly, you are a disgrace !!!!!!
2259 2018-11-28 21:04:40 Refs getting some serious oil money tonight #PSGLIV #PSGLFC
2260 2018-11-28 21:04:38 I'm out awhile ago.. won't be entering into oil plays until a major shift in sentiment.
2261 2018-11-28 21:04:32 Win Jan canola up A$0.69/t & EU rape down A$3.25. Oilseed futures all boosted by drop in US$, but A$ up and wiped out the gains. Expectations of a US interest rate rise have fallen. Soyoil & palm oil both up providing support for canola,
2262 2018-11-28 21:04:31 Add oil 
2263 2018-11-28 21:04:27 When Obama was President,it was easier to get pallets of cash out of the country than barrels of oil out of the ground.
2264 2018-11-28 21:04:27 What????? The person who didn’t support the Keystone Pipeline and blames BIG OIL for almost everything.
2265 2018-11-28 21:04:04 I'm also not a big fan of commodities. I don’t recommend commodities or commodity produces like Gold miners / Oil drillers as real assets (unless you're a great trader). Furthermore, futures are actually very costly to hold even when in a bull market.
2266 2018-11-28 21:04:01 There is really no reason to short this type of move. Institutional sellers will not fade that today.  But Oil, Commodities, and everything that should believe the Chairman did not.  I don't see a sell yet.  I do want some very long term shorts (1 year +) so I will grab higher
2267 2018-11-28 21:04:00 Oil and gas is one problem not the only one its fossil fuels and needs a plan b to modernize with times of electric cars no plastics sans oil heating and more - this needs some forward thinking not just sqeezing last drops out to keep work
2268 2018-11-28 21:03:59 The Canadian economy is being really damaged by non Alberta oil, the main train of Canada, by GM, Sico paint, Bombardier and all others closing down and leaving Canada. There are $$0.00 foreign investments in Canada, everybody running away from socialism!
2269 2018-11-28 21:03:58 Swear if I touch a stock outside of oil and gas, it crumbles 
2270 2018-11-28 21:03:58 I live in Houston - oil country. And OBAMA was anti-energy!!!.  What is he smoking? Folks at the Baker Institute know better than to believe his B-.
2271 2018-11-28 21:03:54 Several rodent operatives have made highly publicised moves into public service recently. Not all been up to scratch, so to speak, particularly the individual at No 10. I find that plug in rodent deterrents or a generous sprinkling of eucalyptus oil can cure the problem humanely.
2272 2018-11-28 21:03:52 It amazes me that some people actually believe that mentally mal-adjust guy
2273 2018-11-28 21:03:44 And yes.. no surprise he has the massage oil
2274 2018-11-28 21:03:42 And works out how to leave without leaving England access to Scottish waters, therefore, denying WM oil revenue.
2275 2018-11-28 21:03:42 you feel better soon too! I am wrapped up as warm as I can surrounded in a cloud smelling of olbas oil to sort me out
2276 2018-11-28 21:03:38 There is a product that I get at Ulta. dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse. It takes out dirt and oil but does not strip my hair remove my color. I squirt it on my wet hair, rub it in and rinse it out. That is what I use between shampoos. I use shampoo AT MOST 1x per week.
2277 2018-11-28 21:03:31 Finally scheduled my oil change lol
2278 2018-11-28 21:03:27 You can literally buy a mist spray bottle for oil nowadays unless there’s something special about saliva 
2279 2018-11-28 21:03:24 @BarackObama YOU (THE WORST PRESIDENT IN USA HISTORY) PREVENTED THE U.S. FROM EXPANDING OIL PRODUCTION. NOW THAT TRUMP MADE US THE BIGGEST OIL PRODUCER, YOU WANT TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT? DO YOU THINK WE'RE ALL FOOLS? HERE'S SOME NEWS FOR YOU: "WE ARE NOT"
2280 2018-11-28 21:03:17 how to make a pumpkin soup 

Ingredients:
-1kg pumpkin 
-2 onions 
-2tbs butter or oil
-2tbs flour 
-800ml vegetable stock
-200g cream
2281 2018-11-28 21:03:09 And mother fucking Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with god damn shit-eating him, even a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
2282 2018-11-28 21:02:59 Yelling "ice cores" at someone who knows what they're talking about is like yelling "but no change in kinds" to a biologist. It IMMEDIATELY proves you don't have the intelligence to be involved. It's crafted specifically to be a pacifier argument for morons like you by oil corps.
2283 2018-11-28 21:02:58 The fed is going to stop. Oil and Lumber aren't participating today. Economy is in trouble. Fed moving to data dependent and the data isnt going to look good.
2284 2018-11-28 21:02:57 Well Mr O, the market dropped big the day after your win, the oil industry outsmarted you with fracking on private land, despite your roadblocks... you did indeed have many victories just not these!
2285 2018-11-28 21:02:56 We've gone from sour notes about interest rates and falling oil and corporate debt to a surprise sexy Santa Claus rally or at least an extended dead cat bounce.
2286 2018-11-28 21:02:49 Get our s*** together and speed up the transition to renewables as is required per the IPCC report regardless. Stop single-use-plastic production as that’s a burgeoning problem that is requiring increasing oil production unnecessarily. If necessary, refine here during transition.
2287 2018-11-28 21:02:35 Obama is full of ! I was a Driller in the oil field  in South Texas and we suffered dearly to stay busy during his tenures. As soon as @realDonaldTrump became President, Drilling companies started bringing up their rigs from the grave yards.  FACT!
2288 2018-11-28 21:02:32 I can fit the words unintended consequences in a tweet. But to create unintended consequences requires complicated laws and economics. Keep it in the ground is simple, direct, effective. To get oil companies on our side, choose one as a scapegoat, and retract all of its licenses.
2289 2018-11-28 21:02:26 You watched that clip and really thought it was an accident? If you do then either he’s the most clumsy NBA player or there was oil on the floor lmfao
2290 2018-11-28 21:02:25 In 2015, US production of crude oil rose to 9.48 MIL barrels per day, the highest annual rate since 1972, and an increase of 90% from the 2008 production of 5.00 MIL barrels per day. On a monthly basis, however, US production peaked in April 2015 at 9.63 MIL barrels. Wikipedia!
2291 2018-11-28 21:02:24 Why?  Focus on growing industries.  #oil
2292 2018-11-28 21:02:20 Lots we can do! As we move, remodel & build: move away from natural gas/oil, & instead use electric cars & appliances (heat pump, induction stove, elect drier). Install solar panels. Ask electric co to go renewable. Buy products/food nearby & in season, not shipped across world.
2293 2018-11-28 21:02:19 Saving oil, but of course increasing electricity use, also have they found out what to do with those batteries when they r done with them???
2294 2018-11-28 21:02:18 It seem you stamble in a oil puddle...
2295 2018-11-28 21:02:11 @AngelHealingArt I'm a surrealist in oil, acrylic, sculpture in my younger days. Love your work.
2296 2018-11-28 21:02:06 A fish oil pill.
2297 2018-11-28 21:02:02 The west’s enemy, Russia debt free state owned central bank dropped the dollar banned the Rothschilds and oil rich, like Syria Iran and former Iraq and Libya pattern here wouldn’t you say

2301 2018-11-28 21:01:50 Steve, your work was invaluable to keep Louisiana's oil and gas industry safe from harm.
As someone who's livelihood depends on the offshore industry, You have my thanks.
Without you and other republicans fighting for U.S. oil independence, I would be out of work.
2302 2018-11-28 21:01:47 You are applying castor oil on your eye brows????
2303 2018-11-28 21:01:32 Clear, concise, direct and no bullshite, well done Nicola, ever the consummate politician. Not like the devious, shifty, lying snake oil saleswoman currently scurrying round Scotland on her totally waste of time tour. As Vox popper from Scotland said on C4 News ‘Little Englander’
2304 2018-11-28 21:01:27 it's like the bat signal but instead of making like a cool entrance i slide in covered in motor oil on all fours and morph into a completely unmovable 3d model of a horse
2305 2018-11-28 21:01:18 Heating is going to be very difficult as we are so reliant on gas/oil heating
2306 2018-11-28 21:01:08 Reason why palm oil no dey last for Yoruba woman house.

2309 2018-11-28 21:01:00 Let him take credit for stabbing climate clowns in the back, he made out like millionaire bandit. Oil made boo boo rich. Like many democraps  and rhino's.
2310 2018-11-28 21:00:54 Tesla as the name implies has revolutionary tech. That the US government should consider substady for energy and environment improvements. The current bottleneck is the average person can't afford to buy. Why have the oil co. Not stopped it?

2314 2018-11-28 21:00:31 Obama tried to strangle America into submission. If you will recall, he purposefully did nothing substantive to reduce the damage caused by the Gulf Oil Spill. He did everything he could to demonize energy...

2317 2018-11-28 21:00:23 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
2318 2018-11-28 21:00:23 I know I’ve gotten old because my ideas for christmas presents are now “oil change gift card” and “any form of healthcare” but mostly “some new clothes please damn”
2319 2018-11-28 21:00:18 You are mischaracterizing him.  He is clearly joking about the oil increase being due to him.
2320 2018-11-28 21:00:17 That makes more sense! It will be interesting to see if oil takes a knee in Colorado for bit ...
2321 2018-11-28 21:00:07 As I recall Obama; you foughtfracking wherever you could, tapping the Anwar oil reserves, the Keystone pipeline, offshore drilling, and opening up Federal lands to oil drilling leases. You did your best to kill the oil industry; & you say you are responsible for oil independence
2322 2018-11-28 21:00:06 Yes 
Go and buy the oil joor
2323 2018-11-28 20:59:47 Aw, come on guys, it's so simple maybe you need a refresher course.  It's all ball bearings nowadays. Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads, and I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone. No, no make that Quaker State
2324 2018-11-28 20:59:44 If u need your oil changed please dm for prices #AAMU
2325 2018-11-28 20:59:39 At this rate Abraham can scores 5 goals and you still lose ffs.
2326 2018-11-28 20:59:38 Oil slaughtered while the DOW is up +608 points. 
This is what happens when the Plunge Protection Team becomes the whatever Gov wants team. Price discovery is DOA in America, as our leaders are content with keeping a broken system going at any cost. All Hell breaks loose soon.
2327 2018-11-28 20:59:27 Oil changes are overrated
2328 2018-11-28 20:59:22 Yeah out here in Alberta we've lost ten times that many jobs in the Oil & Gas sector.... and have been left to twist in the wind. I could give a shit about Oshawa.
2329 2018-11-28 20:59:13 Baby girl got her first oil change today 
2330 2018-11-28 20:59:08 Emergency debate tonight on oil and gas crisis in Canada at the request of @ShannonStubbsMP. #cdnpoli
2331 2018-11-28 20:59:04 Except that today you use the application of violence to invade resource rich nations, kill civilians and steal their oil.
Britain hasn't been threatened since the 1940s.
2332 2018-11-28 20:59:02 Yeah,  as a starter 30% of British exports come from Scotland alone. .. then there's that oil issue.
2333 2018-11-28 20:59:00 Yes the anti oil, coal President Obama.  Is he taking credit for Trump withdrawing from the Paris Accord also?   That would have killed almost all USA manufactoring and moved it and the jobs to China & India.
2334 2018-11-28 20:58:50 Dish soap actually isn't that gentle, since it's meant to remove grease, oil, and stuck pieces of food. The sulfates would probably be drying on a natural hair brush. As someone else mentioned, they should dry upside down so water isn't getting into the ferrule.
2335 2018-11-28 20:58:43 Oil money bud.. I would blame that.
2336 2018-11-28 20:58:33 Voilà une émission qui va renforcer les convictions des #GiletsJaunes de continuer... et le gaz oil pour les entreprises va passer de de 1€ a 1,50€ ... on apprend cela ce soir ?
2337 2018-11-28 20:58:30 AFL-CIO-25:  Texas might be a big example where legislators rarely meet, the rugged individual is still on a lot of minds, and oil mixes well with cows.  They have a religion against big gov't it seems.  And it comes from wealth, frontier struggle, and all that stuff.
2338 2018-11-28 20:58:26 Hahaha. I’m sure if they were covered in motor oil I wouldn’t eat 9
2339 2018-11-28 20:58:19 Was the name of this oil .. is it Oliv oil or what ,?..
2340 2018-11-28 20:58:18 One of your kinsmen "Abiola" after the collective votes he got from Igbo, he denounce the Igbo as part of his plan and were killed by Fulani Yoruba who he trusted so much, same to Buhari the enemy of Igbo who told us that we can get 5% from 100% oil that's from our land an insult
2341 2018-11-28 20:58:13 Pple started drilling for oil on on private land
2342 2018-11-28 20:58:07 So Obama is saying the oil prices and gas prices is his doing so it took 10 years all together for this all to take place what does he think we are stupid or something um he's the one that said this was the new normal or whatever before he left office now he wants credit lmao
2343 2018-11-28 20:58:04 don't trust the Saudis one bit!  How much (or little) oil do they really have under the sand???
2344 2018-11-28 20:57:54 Kindly assisted by the oil price trade-off between Trump and the Saudis. Murder obviously doesn’t come into it anymore.

2347 2018-11-28 20:57:48 Obama didn’t do one positive thing for the oil industry. He wanted to end coal and oil industries. He never wanted the pipeline to be finished. Liberals live in a dream world.
2348 2018-11-28 20:57:40 I recommend LuLuLun face masks, particularly the blue and the ‘precious’ range with red packaging, Bijin Nuka face cream/lotions and Deitanseki hinoki and charcoal soaps. There are other face masks that use sakekasu too, which are great. Plus pure camellia oil is a great serum.
2349 2018-11-28 20:57:38 Love Worcester oil
2350 2018-11-28 20:57:34 i'm not falling for it it's motor oil
2351 2018-11-28 20:57:33 Okay I’m tired of listening to bloggers argue, it’s your turn:

Coconut Oil as a moisturizer, go
(Explain in the comments to further help plz)
2352 2018-11-28 20:57:22 Sometimes adulting is finally taking your car in for an oil change. 
2353 2018-11-28 20:57:20 Another reason why Alaska produce goes to Asia: protectionist Federal law (Jones Act) makes it illegal for foreign flagged ships to carry goods between US ports, so its actually cheaper to ship this stuff (and Alaskan oil, Hawaiian fruit, etc.) to Asia than to US West Coast.

2358 2018-11-28 20:56:40 So are all y'all that were crying about wanting winter gonna help with my oil bill orrrrr??
2359 2018-11-28 20:56:35 No evidence would change him or probably any other Potus opinion on that matter.  Remove oil dependence and we may have a chance.
2360 2018-11-28 20:56:30 These numbers end in Sept, before oil prices tanked. It will be interesting to see if production starts to fall, responding to the election and prices.
2361 2018-11-28 20:56:29 President Obama is now trying to take credit for decrease in oil price.  Wow.
2362 2018-11-28 20:56:25 You’re talking more function than fashion.  I only see the skirts on middle aged white woman who all apparently love bright colors too. Before i lost weight I used to rub a little coconut oil on my thighs.
2363 2018-11-28 20:56:16 Avant de voir les résultats, il faudra attendre un certain temps et les baisses du pouvoir d'achat c'est maintenant !
2364 2018-11-28 20:56:10 Once again we agree...I do not think its a good idea to extend EI for the GM employees....Alberta Oil could have the same argument.

...I was merely showing that you pitched it earlier as a good idea when you thought it was coming from Trudeau.

2366 2018-11-28 20:55:53 Excelente cierre del $SPX, muy bien lo de $GGAL también, no hubo empome al cierre y mañana tiene que abrir verde... Los lotes ya deberían subir fuerte porque quedaron todos muy baratos. $PBR se la bancó bien pese al OIL que cayó fuerte, compensó con el S&P. Mañana puede rebotar.
2367 2018-11-28 20:55:52 Because people owning solar power is the same as owning the oil well instead of paying by the gallon at the pump. They don't want just profits, they want an oligopoly that gives them easy and unjust profits. We need to give the power back to the people, literally!
2368 2018-11-28 20:55:47 Score me some argane infused oil
2369 2018-11-28 20:55:47 genetics boi  nah, hair moisture and oil tbh
2370 2018-11-28 20:55:39 I know I'm a Debbie downer but Oil if it can't rally today what is wrong with it.
2371 2018-11-28 20:55:26 Obama claims he created all the new USA oil production in spite of his daily efforts to stop it. What a sleazy liar he is
2372 2018-11-28 20:55:25 And the surprising thing is that nothing will happen to them, but you go do mistake take Lil contaminated water, na hospital go get you.
God is great
2373 2018-11-28 20:55:21 Thanks a lot. She doesn’t represent regular people at all. She has 100 million in the bank from special interests like oil and gas and big Pharma. And if this is the way you’re going to choose leaders, get ready to lose again in a couple years. #MedicareForAll #moveleftordie
2374 2018-11-28 20:55:15 Not trustworthy. Against ALL natural humankind rules. Import makes no sense and the 4'000'000'000'000 USD invested into Africa since 1960 created psychopathic kings and oil billionaires. Stop brainwashing the world. Don't play far-right extreme globalists. So cheap and obvious.

2377 2018-11-28 20:54:55 -4 feels like -8 and I’m out under my car changing the oil, to save 80 bucks. Sometimes I don’t think I’ve learned a single thing in 40 years of being an adult.
2378 2018-11-28 20:54:55 That bailout was in 2008, and the industry was booming until your tariffs- let's talk oil subsidies your bunch tries to cut social security and medicare & gives us a huge deficit thanks to your giving millions to the rich & to the oil companies let's do something about that
2379 2018-11-28 20:54:49 “From chunky oil to near 4 digit horsepower” -@ant8262 if that isn’t a glow up for the s14 idk what is
2380 2018-11-28 20:54:48 So real and practical progress - in your opinion - comes from people who want to be Premier completely ignoring the reality that there is an end in sight to the viable oil industry in Alberta? 20-30 years is NOT a long time when you are talking about tilting an entire economy.
2381 2018-11-28 20:54:46 Who asks about the 4x4 capability of a wrangler with a bed lol . Same truck what would be different. I’m more wearied about the previous issues with oil and grease leaks from with the previous versions. Also the bolt rust on the undercarriage
2382 2018-11-28 20:54:46 today was my first day off of work without classes and what did i do? i got an oil change.........does this mean im an adult now
2383 2018-11-28 20:54:39 If oil / gas prices are so low from #SaudiArabia, why aren't we seeing it at the pump?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @PressSec @GOP @cnnbrk @FoxNews #Khashoggi #murder #hacksaw #Saudi #MBS
2384 2018-11-28 20:54:31 Motor oil though . Can’t lie, That’s super clever.
2385 2018-11-28 20:54:29 My next car will be a hybrid, gonna put me in jail Donald, as you tweeted? I will be happy not to give you or Saudis money for blood oil
2386 2018-11-28 20:54:20 traditional deep frying is not. oven fried is b/c no oil
2387 2018-11-28 20:54:14 @Midas I am both shocked and appalled. I have thoroughly enjoyed my service through Midas for years now, but I don't know if I'll be able to return. While receiving my high mileage oil change today in Cedar Falls, I noticed a Confederate flag decal on one of the tool chests.
2388 2018-11-28 20:54:10 Faut arrêter avec le terme "banquier", ça veut rien dire. Il a fait de la fusac, pas analyste oil & gas. 

En revanche, c'est vrai qu'il n'a jamais prouvé la moindre érudition enquoi que ce soit.
2389 2018-11-28 20:53:59 And the oil will top $150 a barrel ..
2390 2018-11-28 20:53:57 Good lord. Do you know anything about the NEP? Do you know the Supreme Court ruled that parts of the NEP were unconstitutional? It was a blatant attempt to steal oil from the west and sell it to eastern Canada at a huge discount. You call that Energy East? Hahahahaha. Idiot!
2391 2018-11-28 20:53:43 remember when sara thought my oil was an essential oil and not weed CLASSIC!
2392 2018-11-28 20:53:43 Blame it on poor mind set, otherwise money is always available. Oil itself is money.
2393 2018-11-28 20:53:40 Very good. I dont know all details but this smells like malicious prosecution to me.
2394 2018-11-28 20:53:40 All production occurs on private land. He is not responsible for any production that occurred. The few companies that stayed in operation were barely getting by. Texas oil field died in 2008 thanks to O. The shale production hit and obama insisted on using middle east oil.
2395 2018-11-28 20:53:33 When someone asks me what I want for Christmas...is it wrong to say an oil change, a full tank of gas and a fully stocked fridge? #AdultPriorities
2396 2018-11-28 20:53:29 Just smashed a brand new bottle of tea tree oil in the bathroom, ill be high as a kite in 20mins or so
2397 2018-11-28 20:53:11 Shows how foggy you are - in order for the Canadian government to have money to give any province - it came from Alberta Oil not Quebec maple syrup!
2398 2018-11-28 20:53:09 I did that too :( . just add oil or ghee to it while making, it works!
2399 2018-11-28 20:53:01 NAILS

2400 2018-11-28 20:53:01 Lol a word is enough fr the wise shaa 
2401 2018-11-28 20:52:58 Says the tax avoiding fop who is so confident in his principles he hides his ill gotten gains in Dublin - shame on @leovaradker for allowing his snake oil outfit in - fit & proper really ??
2402 2018-11-28 20:52:43 And when MBS says if you do anything to Saudi Arabia we’re going to block all oil leaving the Middle East region, what do you think happens after that.
2403 2018-11-28 20:52:38 The implication of crude oil prices for Nigeria is apparent. We are currently at a price below our budget benchmark of $60pb that to say we gonna have an increase in budget deficit
2404 2018-11-28 20:52:28 My dad is going to be hellllaaa pissed when he finds out I used his card for my oil change, my inspection, my light, and my stickers. 
2405 2018-11-28 20:52:26 Question Period begins. UCP Leader Jason Kenney addressing the oil price crisis. Asks government in mandatory supporting curtailment. #ableg
2406 2018-11-28 20:52:25 To me it's another clue on the state's ability to choose winners & losers as the war on commodities continues. Actually amazing that they can quarantine oil while we watch the DOW soar +605 points. Fingerprints of the PPT.
2407 2018-11-28 20:52:22 Yea, the idiot is on record saying the US can't drill its way out of thisback in 2011 or so, said it several times, was just doing favors for Buffet denying the pipelines, since he owned the railroads that transport oil. Obama is one grand liar.
2408 2018-11-28 20:52:15 ทำแบบนี้กับคนอื่นจนเป็นเรื่องปกติหรอ?
2409 2018-11-28 20:52:04 @Q107Calgary 

With the sheer amount of crap Alberta is taking over our oil and being blocked at every turn, I have to say I find it incredibly offensive you guys still play Neil Young.  There are better rockers out there that aren't trying to shut down AB or call it Hiroshima.
2410 2018-11-28 20:51:56 being a hypochondriac and taking an infectious disease class is like mixing oil and water. So far ive properly diagnosed myself with 3 ~rare~ infectious diseases! Can’t wait to see how many more I can diagnose myself with before the end of the semester
2411 2018-11-28 20:51:53 Question period opens up on the oil price differential.

2416 2018-11-28 20:51:47 Oil production went up because Bush allowed more drilling and fracking during his tenure and US oil reserves skyrocketed. Nice try Barry.

2418 2018-11-28 20:51:35 Omg where is my dad when i need him i deadass didn’t know how to open the hood of my car when i pulled up to get an oil change LMFAO
2419 2018-11-28 20:51:22 I had the same problem and the way it was explained to me was that my skin was overall dry and it led to excess oil production in the t-zone.

Completely de-oil/dead skinning and moisturizing a bunch fixes it for me.
Hopefully same?
2420 2018-11-28 20:51:20 Yep, does for me. Can you give some references to prove that I’m wrong about Obama shutting down oil production? Or references to show that he boosted oil production? I’ll wait.

2425 2018-11-28 20:50:29 Crude oil price continues to plunge amidst rising US stockpiles. The market continues to be under pressure, worries of a supply glut and slowing global demand growth

2428 2018-11-28 20:50:25 #Mexico is the world's eighth largest #producer of #oil, at almost 3 million barrels per day. This is less than #Canada, #Iran, or #Iraq but more than other big exporters such as #Kuwait, #Brazil, or #Nigeria
2429 2018-11-28 20:50:21 Under proposed laws, #ASIS officers could kill a poor #TimorLeste citizen who happened to stumble upon & "interfere" in ASIS's operation to bug the Tomor-Leste government so Australia could steal their oil for Woodside. Before we give them these powers, ask what they do. #auspol

2435 2018-11-28 20:49:47 I would want MBS gone but in the meantime stop buying there oil and cut off military aid when MBS moves to his new position of overseer of the camel herd then we can talk
2436 2018-11-28 20:49:46 Yes? Whats wrong with cannabis oil?
2437 2018-11-28 20:49:44 Pats himself for environment with one hand, largest Oil producer with the other. Ishis idiocracy really lost on him
2438 2018-11-28 20:49:44 Oil spill!!!! Or rainbow!!!! Or you know the one everyone wants, half game theory green and half film theory red, seems like a good one too
2439 2018-11-28 20:49:38 Hope you feel better! Its a Beautiful cold day here in NC. I just got back home from paying taxes on my car to get the new sticker and registration. I just noticed I'm going to have to save up for 2 new front tires and an oil change. Oh my, everyday issues.
2440 2018-11-28 20:49:34 What a Douche! He tried his damnedest to shut the oil and coal industries down! He wanted everything “green”. He wanted carbon taxes! Are all the Democrats just going to pretend they BELIEVE what he just said?!? He sooo wants to take credit for Pres Trump’s economy, smh. LIAR!
2441 2018-11-28 20:49:29 I see no one fussing over Oil today.

Wonder why? Hmmm. Let me think about this.
2442 2018-11-28 20:49:29 Making things more expensive is a two way street & others will follow make it more expensive for US companies too. Either you can compete or not. Creating a false sense of competitiveness through tariffs is a road to nowhere. Trucks are popular because at moment oil i cheap.
2443 2018-11-28 20:49:26 Absolutely correct!
Obama refused to move forward w oil production here- he had several excuses to not allow it.
He’s a joke now. 
Better than that- we know it.

New paddle ordered!
2446 2018-11-28 20:48:57 i have this diet supplement/lax at home that im thinking of taking but it literally makes me shit out oil so im 
2447 2018-11-28 20:48:51 We're all supposed to forget all of the things he did to stop oil production & told us we'd be getting our oil from Brazil.
2448 2018-11-28 20:48:38 This older gentlemen approached me at work and asked if the product he was holding could help with the wart? or cut? on his palm. He shows me the product and I want to bust out laughing, but I restrain myself. The product was a warming sensual oil.

2450 2018-11-28 20:48:32 Not coated in oil & popped into a tin?
2451 2018-11-28 20:48:30 #somaliland daily politics should stop. we need to start preparing for what’s ahead which is important 
There has to be a structure for how the country would benefit from the near future oil revenues and how to direct it to building the country and cut any chances for corruption
2452 2018-11-28 20:48:30 fire! its prob the oil in the peels or something
2453 2018-11-28 20:48:28 ofc everyone else gets to make soap off avocado oil, coconut oil... i got assigned fucking LARD
2454 2018-11-28 20:48:26 HAHAH TAKE THAT YOU DIRTY OIL CUNTS
2455 2018-11-28 20:48:25 You think everyone is like u ?
2456 2018-11-28 20:48:20 #SaudiArabia is bombing the crap out of #Yemen, but you don’t care @SecPompeo and neither does @POTUS. #oil #dirtymoney
2457 2018-11-28 20:48:13 Seeds are pressed with heat treatment resulting in a higher yield of oil, cold press is the same without heat application. And yes there is an improvement in quality. Refining is different and is an additional process. First pressing yield is always best.
2458 2018-11-28 20:48:08 In spite of that we continue to tax, virtue signal, and " restrict oil"  ourselves into irrelevance. Yikes.
2459 2018-11-28 20:48:02 Obama is as full of shit as a Christmas turkey.  He did everything he could to hamper oil production in this country.
2460 2018-11-28 20:47:54 why dont you read into why we are dealing with a massive discount on our oil?  why are we getting $11 for it a barrel? why in the last year has that differential grown 5 fold? how are you helping the Canadian economy by hurting an industry that’s 6x bigger than the auto industry?
2461 2018-11-28 20:47:52 Doesn't help either that the ref (and @uefa) have been paid off with oil money.
PSG getting free kicks for literally everything, us not so much.
Verratti should've been sent off for his challenge on Gomez but the ref barely produced the yellow
2462 2018-11-28 20:47:51 Oh, but you would give credit to Trump??? Why don’t you go look at US Oil production BEFORE and then AFTER Obama left office. We’ll never have an honest conversation if we judge Obama by a different standard than Trump.
2463 2018-11-28 20:47:45 to not fall in family troubles the most of best ways:
1. keep silenced
2. never give an attention
3. whatever is happened, never being nervous or mad
4. stay away - like 10 miles away from Oil tank
5. cool down, and calm down
6. if you do all that you succeed
 I give you %
2464 2018-11-28 20:47:43 They really are, I use the oil over night but it sinks in so well it could even be used under make up if you’re really dry! See if the 30% off code works for them too! They have a VitC facial peel to get rid of dead skin but that might dry u out?? As a combo they’re great xx
2465 2018-11-28 20:47:43 try to get some antihistamine and eucalyptus oil
2466 2018-11-28 20:47:31 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost @SaraEisen Why do people & bankers bother investing in US #Oil @US_OGA, the more they pump, the lower their profits (or perhaps losses)! #wti
2467 2018-11-28 20:47:28 I really need to go get the oil changed in my green Jeep but like that's SO MUCH EFFORT

2472 2018-11-28 20:47:11 Just realized I never registered my car this year because it was in the shop for 3 months after getting hit  , My L’s is probably suspended, I have over $700 in parking tickets and I need an oil change ... imma just light this blunt tho.
2473 2018-11-28 20:47:02 I'm going to enjoy seeing you oil and gas propagandists get ratio'ed from now until you realize how stupid you are.
2474 2018-11-28 20:47:00 That would be an awesome idea. If the East wanted our oil. But they rather spend double for #SaudiOil
2475 2018-11-28 20:46:59 well it depends. if i need a good nights sleep i like a gummy bear. otherwise a few drops of oil to relax me. of course everyone is diff right. my friend who goes thru the same is taking a 1:1 ratio oil (cbd to thc) and that works for her. a few drops
2476 2018-11-28 20:46:56 What absolute inane BS. The shale revolution started with the 2005 Energy Policy Act under President Bush. Give Obama one star, he and 73 of his colleagues voted YEA to pass the act.

Other than that, everything he did as President was to discourage domestic oil production
2477 2018-11-28 20:46:56 Definitely getting paid by the oil merchants
2478 2018-11-28 20:46:49 Romantic k3...I pity the girl, she needs 18 anointing oil with serious prayers
2479 2018-11-28 20:46:48 Avg person doesn’t know cbd, but already there’s a lot of snake oil cbd going around, which is concerning to say the least
2480 2018-11-28 20:46:46 I remember watching a DW documentary about the negative impact of EU WMP exports to West Africa on local dairy farmers. The WMP's fat was palm oil and the WMP in question was being exported to a palm oil producer!! The justification is presumably economic!!!
2481 2018-11-28 20:46:45 presuming gas car, yes. But even a Tesla has some fluids that will leak, albeit no oil changes or spilled gasoline.
2482 2018-11-28 20:46:43 The only oil product that President Barack Obama brought to our American Shores was Deep Water Horizon.
2483 2018-11-28 20:46:31 When I’m watching a skincare video and the person lets it be known that they use coconut oil as a moisturizer for their face I just turn the video off.
2484 2018-11-28 20:46:27 กูแพ้แล้ว
2485 2018-11-28 20:46:26 So rediculous!
During Obama's regime, rhe oil companies were all set to expand because they saw the need!
Obama blocked them at every turn, including pipelines!
Trump opened the valves!
2486 2018-11-28 20:46:23 Doug this is getting tiresome - what you are saying about Gas Prices has NOTHING to do with Cap-n-Trade or a #CarbonTax. (You R wrong!!) It's that the world crude oil price is down substantially. That fact, is actually HURTING Canada at a macro economic level!
2487 2018-11-28 20:46:20 I am not sure I understand why Justin held an emergency meeting in the House to discuss what to do because an industry that relies on fossil fuels was going to leave town.  Isn't this expected when trying to shut down Canada's Oil and Gas industry?
2488 2018-11-28 20:46:18 Obama shut down offshore oil wells and he and the left have demonized fracking, which is the cause of America’s upsurge in oil production. The left also hates Alaskan oil production. Domestic oil production is up IN SPITE OF Obama, not because of him.
2489 2018-11-28 20:46:14 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2490 2018-11-28 20:46:09 lol the demand for oil worldwide daily is $100 million barrels/day. that will hardly make a dent. its not even realized demand. you’re also not considering future growth in demand in a massive, growing economies like China. Take it up a higher level and don’t focus on the details
2491 2018-11-28 20:46:08 $upl is a $naturalgas $stock! Not $oil! $naturalgas play and it's up big!

2498 2018-11-28 20:45:17 That mirrors just about every smaller community in Alberta that supports the oil/gas industry. Unemployment is at an all time high. Food banks are under stress, and helplessness is a prominent feeling.
2499 2018-11-28 20:45:16 Manyi and truth is like Oil and Water
2500 2018-11-28 20:45:15 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2501 2018-11-28 20:44:57 If I remember correctly he heavily regulated the oil industry causing many jobs lost.
2502 2018-11-28 20:44:53 Why did people in the old west buy snake oil?  For the amazing results they were promised.
2503 2018-11-28 20:44:52 Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer ... that was me people ... say thank you."

So the whole green initiative and climate change stuff was BS?
2504 2018-11-28 20:44:46 Republican win senate seat stock market rises over 500 points oil and gasoline prices going down Thank you @realDonaldTrump President of the United States

2507 2018-11-28 20:44:37 I’d wash the car ,get oil change and whatever it is .. cuz y’all females just get in n drive lol
2508 2018-11-28 20:44:36 What would you call sautéed sliced chicken tenders, red and orange bell pepper, onions, garlic, then sauced with soy sauce, sesame oil, gochujang, and brown sugar? Whatever it is I just made it.
2509 2018-11-28 20:44:34 To all those opposed to pipelines, Alberta buying rail cars and shipping more oil by rail should absolutely terrify you! Investors, cue up rail car manufacturers.
2510 2018-11-28 20:44:34 Oil 10 billion in subsidies 2015-2016. Farmers 12 billion this year. Use the Internet. It’s not hard.
2511 2018-11-28 20:44:30 Andy, as far as I know Trudeau had nothing to do with disastrously low oil prices nor GM’s move to close five plants. Your alarmist outbreaks are an insult to Canadians!!
2512 2018-11-28 20:44:13 with oil collapsing, inflation breakevens collapsing, yes there is a compelling case to be made to stop at the lower end of the range.
2513 2018-11-28 20:43:58 Same.  This whole oil fiasco is crazy.  I wasn’t expecting $100 PB however did not expect $50 Pb
2514 2018-11-28 20:43:41 No palm oil should enter the food chain via milk production on any occasion whatever the economic excuse
2515 2018-11-28 20:43:33 Hi Steph, you can buy the Wellbeing Pod on it's own, or buy it with one oil, or you can buy the Wellbeing Pod on it's own, then add all 4 of the oil blends and get one of them for free! Up to you, whatever works best!

2519 2018-11-28 20:43:17 yes - I liked the silver tea service, but this is more efficient.  I don't think oil cares if it's given slippers and an eye-mask.
2520 2018-11-28 20:43:17 Saudi Arabia is not our friend in any shape or form. They have threaten the US constantly for decades with rhetoric - and have threatened us countless times to cut the US off completely or raise the price of oil to exuberant levels.  #maga

2522 2018-11-28 20:42:56 Smells are so much worse when you are pregnant too. I remember having a strong aversion to the smell of olive oil!
2523 2018-11-28 20:42:56 I grew up in the TX Panhandle. Barbecue means BEEF, chili contains no beans or other vegetables, a sweetened carbonated beverage is a coke, and crude oil "smells like money."
2524 2018-11-28 20:42:38 I think the simple answer is that our talent is heavily recruited by the U.S. I knew a family whose dad would cross the St. Clair River daily into Detroit to work for G.M. George was making 250K over 30 years ago so I know all too well how powerful the U.S. oil and auto lobby is.

2527 2018-11-28 20:42:24 Can you believe it took one Iceland advert for everyone to finally realise how bad palm oil is
2528 2018-11-28 20:42:19 Break out a little oil.. offer a trivia question(if they get it right, free flash),  change the music, start stretching in sexy poses(helps the back too), move the cam super close so it's just your face and edge with a wand... That's all I've got for now? Lol
2529 2018-11-28 20:42:16 Think he meant to say “In spite of me, we became the biggest oil producer.”
2530 2018-11-28 20:42:02 Bummer. Just noticed. Jacobs cream crackers use palm oil. I am going to have to stop eating them till they take it out.
2531 2018-11-28 20:42:02 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
2532 2018-11-28 20:41:50 I think I see what's coming folks and it's not good. Please don't be triggered to do something you will regret if any bad news comes out. Like I've been saying for a while now. There is a boiling pot of oil that is about to combust. Act, don't react. Trust in God Only.
2533 2018-11-28 20:41:41 I've just been given an early Christmas present from my wife. An oil painting of our Airedale Terrier. What a fantastic painting. Raya is truly gifted. I would highly recommend her.
2534 2018-11-28 20:41:41 Good luck! I know just doing a few pressure points with light, circular motion really helps relieve some of the inflammation and pressure! Soooo annoying. I also boil water with like 30 drops of peppermint oil and waft it into my face. Helps a bunch!!

2554 2018-11-28 20:40:28 nah story goes beyond today.
only thing that was gonna save you was oil if it crossed 50 but it didn't. 
that's it for me today.

2555 2018-11-28 20:40:27 delicious especially with the motor oil 
2556 2018-11-28 20:40:25 Guess it was driven by high oil prices, correct me of am wrong. Also not the report says it's the 1st time growth is driven by non oil products
2557 2018-11-28 20:40:12 I thought me and olive oil were in good terms.
Apparently not
2558 2018-11-28 20:40:11 Says Mr. kill the oil and coal industry and loves electric cars.  This guy!
2559 2018-11-28 20:40:09 @Edwin_Honoret 
crack an egg, mayo and some olive oil.  make it into a paste and put in your hair before you wash it, put on a cap it bag, leave it for like 20 mins. wash it out and condition. leave conditioner for like 10 mins. after you finish washing put leave in condition.
2560 2018-11-28 20:40:08 Gore said that years ago, and we are still here.  Sorry Sparty, sell that snake oil elsewhere.

2563 2018-11-28 20:39:50 Until the next global oil crisis.
2564 2018-11-28 20:39:50 I live in an area where all our electricity is from clean energy, Nuclear, Wind, Solar, and Hydro. 
We stopped using Coal, Oil, and Gas. 

I keep my heat low, because I enjoy the colder temperature to begin with. 

And I walk when I’m able. If I could use electric car, I would.

2566 2018-11-28 20:39:40 Lol name one. That's a really great thing the TV told you, but whos profitting more? Oil companies or solar panel companies?

Legitimately wonder if you're even capable of honesty

2568 2018-11-28 20:39:05 What the hell happened to the uk's North Sea oil money?
2569 2018-11-28 20:39:04 Yes! The oil patch collapsed here in Oklahoma, laying off roughnecks, welders, truckers, and land management people big time. It affected the entire economy, most especially construction, too. BO is full of !
2570 2018-11-28 20:39:04 @realDonaldTrump and to us ALL: the Lord PROMISES to: ‘provide for those who grieve in Zion-- to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.’ -Isa 61. #WWG1WWGA #promisesofGod
2571 2018-11-28 20:38:59 I will laugh my ass off he says Trump is taking a cut of the money from buying oil cheap as a way of blood money But then again I dont see that happening whenTruml is on Russia's right boob so hard he looks like a new born
2572 2018-11-28 20:38:53 We went into Kuwait in 1991 and the store is it was to protect Saudi Arabia and the oil fields and we're still there. Now y'all want to cut off military aid.
Is it because y'all think the president is a racist and why y'all continue to attacked the heritage of the Confederacy!
2573 2018-11-28 20:38:52 @BBCWatchdog Hermes left my Holland and Barrett CBD oil delivery on the pavement outside my house. I found it when I got home from work at 11pm! #duffdeliveries
2574 2018-11-28 20:38:47 Most of us think this occurred despite Obama’s best efforts to derail this oil & gas boom. BTW Recall his efforts to hold up and cancel the Keystone Pipeline, for example? What a joke?
2575 2018-11-28 20:38:45 Assuming he had a logic behind it, it's that people should deny global warming as they disinvest from all coastal regions, you know, like how the Oil Companies deny AGW while designing their rigs to handle increasing sealevels.
2576 2018-11-28 20:38:35 It began under Bush though, it was Bush's policy that led to it increasing every year. Obama opposed almost everything and now he takes credit because he was unable to kill the US oil industry? That's a lie everyday.
2577 2018-11-28 20:38:34 Obama's trolling Trump got to be.  Obama would no more take credit for increasing oil production then environmentalist taking a job on an oil platform and give tips on how to increase production.
2578 2018-11-28 20:38:22 I knew at that moment that he was a PT Barnum, a snake oil salesman
I know that area well & told them what they wanted to hear without 1 iota on 'how' it was to be done
GM isn't off the hook, but he has his little hands in it

2586 2018-11-28 20:37:58 Thank goodness nothing serious. They just tightened the oil pan.
2587 2018-11-28 20:37:57 Torn apart there. Forza oil money
2588 2018-11-28 20:37:52 Of all the plastic, oil rich clubs, I think it’s PSG I hate most. Just utterly soulless.
2589 2018-11-28 20:37:50 But you wouldn't ignore measures to make sure your engine lasts a while. You change the oil, keep other fluids up, etc.

It's a poor analogy, frankly.

If you're driving too fast and getting out of control, you push the brakes or at least take your foot off the gas.
2590 2018-11-28 20:37:45 The Afghanis have no where to go! 17 years?  They been at war with each other for thousands of years. It is their culture. Even Alexander the Great said Afghanistan is "easy to march into, hard to march out of." #History #Oil #Minerals #Greed
2591 2018-11-28 20:37:43 Really!!! I'm impressed!!! Just want to lather you in baby oil... (or anything else that takes your fancy!) 
2592 2018-11-28 20:37:39 Shit it’s Our mechanic not out. And yeah those kids get me too. So earnest and it’s all so fast and then it’s 400$ and you’re like ‘but...it was an oil change!’
2593 2018-11-28 20:37:33 Olive oil

2595 2018-11-28 20:37:25 So **that's** what oil money can do for a football team 
2596 2018-11-28 20:37:23 YOU LIE!!!! @POTUS44 
You had NOTHING to do with this oil production as Trump REVERSED your policies!!!!!!
Sad thing is there are sheep that actually believe your prattling!!!
2597 2018-11-28 20:37:21 #oil #wti $50 huge support at this level. If this goes it's tin hat time! All up to OPEC to decide direction...
2598 2018-11-28 20:37:21 That’s exactly what the Middle East needs, befor democracy we need enlightenment, democracy right now only brings islamists to power b/c people are steeped in their ideology. Qatar and Saudi Arabia had poured oil money to build that islamist ideology for decades
2599 2018-11-28 20:37:20 They're broke, no access to treasury in four years, plus their candidate is a serial loser, he's already conceded defeat with his conscience
2600 2018-11-28 20:37:18 He tried to shut oil production down. Lost billions of dollars on failed solar energy adventures. Such a man-child!
2601 2018-11-28 20:37:16 Wasted the last two hours of my life at Nissan waiting for an oil change and tire rotation  pretty sure they forgot about me.
2602 2018-11-28 20:37:08 Corporations, oil drilling. Only 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions. Oil drilling disrupts the land and causes chaotic climate change. Indigenous people in the Amazon have been warning us for years.

2604 2018-11-28 20:37:06 I did the same thing with a bottle of motor oil over the weekend. Not recommended.
2605 2018-11-28 20:37:04 Any successes that US oil companies experienced during his reign were in spite of him, not because of him.
2606 2018-11-28 20:37:03 wow just found a coupon for an oil change that i forgot about and i had planned to go tomorrow to get one literally right before the coupon expires.
2607 2018-11-28 20:37:02 We’re not even that dependent on their oil nowadays, as a net 4% importer.
2608 2018-11-28 20:37:00 bole kayanya. coba baby oil ajaa nder
2609 2018-11-28 20:36:54 other countries are already looking to change from purchasing oil with US dollars, funny how every country that is looking to change is considered a hostile state 
2610 2018-11-28 20:36:41 Это так ужасно((( Хотелось бы как-то вас утешить, и сказать, что вам не следует так сильно расстраиваться и ненавидеть себя. Но... Я понимаю, что как всегда неправильно подберу слова и не смогу донести вам всё то, что думаю...
2611 2018-11-28 20:36:39 Fuck off PSG you oil money shit fuck club
2612 2018-11-28 20:36:37 Strategically use Alberta's oil as feedstock for value-added products - develop those industries; don't just export the raw oil and natural gas.  Use the gas for more co-generation plants and electricity generation for a digital/electric world.
2613 2018-11-28 20:36:16 #UKOG Here's a question for smart arses penguins and starbright on LSE .

How many Barells of oil will  #Horsehill produce over 7 months commingled testing of Kimmeridge Horizons KL3 and KL4 ?

Come on smart arses. How many millions of $$ revenue will that make in sales?

2616 2018-11-28 20:36:03 Imagine being the president of dark money org funded by oil barons that owns politicians across the state and taking to twitter to talk about the “elite”. How out of touch would you have to be?
2617 2018-11-28 20:35:57 Our brains are starving! Alzheimer's is such a sad condition. Such a simple solution=coconut oil
2618 2018-11-28 20:35:46 Obama took credit in a speech today saying the “oil boom” in USA was his idea. He tried to STOP all fracking and all oil exploration including ANWR.  Obama stopped the pipeline from being built. He gave trillions in electric car subsidies to GM.
This oil boom is TRUMP’S idea!
2619 2018-11-28 20:35:45 @BarackObama  can certainly pat himself on the back for the biggest oil producer......in the Gulf of Mexico........  BP OIL SPILL  (and he refused help to clean it up)
2620 2018-11-28 20:35:40 has helped or hurt oil prices?
2621 2018-11-28 20:35:35 A "rowboat" will come along to zip around the "oil tankers," I think. The worst thing will be for govt to prop up oil tankers, but there will be pressures.  Everyone loves market forces when they're favourable, and wants protection when they turn ugly.
2622 2018-11-28 20:35:32 ...Mideast oil consumers shouldn't worry anymore. Mr. Trump have put an end to political  history ,geography...in just one sentence. A brilliant mind indeed and should be taken seriously !
2623 2018-11-28 20:35:25 This ref’s on the oil payroll.

2628 2018-11-28 20:35:00 Why does @Twitter keep trying to ram this big oil propaganda crap in our face?
2629 2018-11-28 20:34:57 Isn’t this one of President Obamas “deals” that he can take credit for (economy, oil stock market etc)
2630 2018-11-28 20:34:46 The @CPC_HQ were in power for 10 years under @stephenharper and did absolutely nothing regarding Canadian oil and energy workers in Alberta!
2631 2018-11-28 20:34:43 What makes you so sure Trudeau is going to lose in 2019? Show proof and evidence instead of repeating the same tire pro oil conservative attack shills. he is unpopular in Alberta but is still popular elsewhere. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #PanelsNotPipelines #AlbertaWhine

2634 2018-11-28 20:34:34 @BarackObama did everything he could to prevent the US from becoming the largest oil producer. Now he wants to take credit for it??  What a liar and a hypocrite.
2635 2018-11-28 20:34:33 about to drench my body in coconut oil because baby cohen is taking ALL the moisture out of me
2636 2018-11-28 20:34:32 You brought into Trump side show and brought his snake oil and drink it and now you're sick you brought into his words well pretty words aren't always true and true words aren't always pretty.
2637 2018-11-28 20:34:30 Must be getting ready for the coming election.  You just now care about the oil and gas industry
2638 2018-11-28 20:34:25 Let us not forget who said, while the economy was crawling along, this was the "New Norm".  Obama wanted kill the coal business, limited federal land drilling for oil, made fun of Sara Palin "Drill Baby Drill" & applied heavy regulations on oil. 
2639 2018-11-28 20:34:21 0 products, running on rumors, and have an offering. Snake oil ceo too.

2642 2018-11-28 20:34:16 A legend in his own mind.  A snake oil salesman.
2643 2018-11-28 20:34:16 When using olive oil as a sexual lubricant, it is neither necessary nor apt to spend the extra money on the Extra Virgin.
2644 2018-11-28 20:34:01 All our governments are dependent on oil they are paid by the banks who rely on big oil to make them profits. You think they would sabotage their own source of income for what reason?
2645 2018-11-28 20:33:58 Dude eucalyptus is the best!! I use a lotion that’s just unscented lotion and the essential oil and it helps with all of this!

2648 2018-11-28 20:33:43 Often these innovation don't get mentioned unfortunately. All we are getting from media is oil is bad & it is Alberta fault for relying on oil. I have to blame on years of bureaucrat red tape making it impossible to do anything efficiently. The responsibility need to fall on PM.
2649 2018-11-28 20:33:42 Sunflower, safflower, avocado, coconut oil, grapeseed oil are all great for cooking. Go for 100% pure/cold pressed/virgin
2650 2018-11-28 20:33:40 watching these people do love play in front of me and it’s doing me to pour them cooking oil
2651 2018-11-28 20:33:38 KB is ignoring the fact that China's non-commodity goods trade surplus is $700B, per IIF.  I suspect he's ignoring it for good reason - if China can price commodities in CNY (see CNY oil contract), then China will not have a BoP problem for a long, long time.
2652 2018-11-28 20:33:26 We tried to tell them he is a snake oil salesman.

2672 2018-11-28 20:32:15 Canada should not only end all military sales to Saudi Arabia but also ban oil imports. Domestic production far exceeds our consumption.  Irving refines Saudi Oil.  They can get their supply from Newfoundland, which exports.

Tonselectomy. Appendectomy. Ether on a mechanic rag. Seriously. Vaccines that bubbled, scabbed then scared
2693 2018-11-28 20:30:59 Yes it was you Obama, when you moved out from the WH, America became the worlds oil producer again. Thank you that your presidency is over.
2694 2018-11-28 20:30:50 This vape oil can be used with any refillable vape pen or device. It is nicotine and THC free and has 500mg of Pure CBD Hemp Oil per container.
2695 2018-11-28 20:30:50 old enough to remember when lower oil was bad for the mkts.
2696 2018-11-28 20:30:49 Honestly exfoliate and use any cream mousturiser you have thats not too oil based. Too much oil clogs pores and causes spots etc. Hope your skin clears up x
2697 2018-11-28 20:30:46 My parents had me fill two empty oil drums full of water that sat in my room for 2 month after in case the faucets stopped working and we had bought a ton of bottled water.
2698 2018-11-28 20:30:35 End ties now! We produce enough oil here in America to show them wtf is up.
2699 2018-11-28 20:30:33 Maybe oil companies should live with a smaller profit margin instead of firing people.

2701 2018-11-28 20:30:25 70's oil shock caused a recession and inflation and bank rates where raised! It is normally the case that when i recession interest rates are cut but as BoE pointed out, this is not something normal monetary policy can manage by cutting interest rates.

2704 2018-11-28 20:30:14 i smoked a blunt before an oil change and i was telling the employee that i spilt gasoline in my car and it smelled like it for so long and he goes “yeah i smell the gas too”  lmaooo
2705 2018-11-28 20:30:13 It happened in spite of him not because of him. He tried banning oil drilling as much as he could!
2706 2018-11-28 20:30:09 So no London and South East alocated costs are included in the figures. You must be a BBC propaganda dream. NO ONE EVER GOT RICH FROM OIL. Saudi and Norwegion foodbanks? No? Just Scottish foodbanks then?
2707 2018-11-28 20:29:59 Too busy making sure that oil don’t dry up 
2708 2018-11-28 20:29:49 OMG!!  What an idiot, judging and loving according to stretch marks?  *smh* 
Try using baby oil, rub it well in and eventually the skin will regain it's elasticity and be almost what it was, however, I would say to her, if you're that shallow, she'd be better off without you
2709 2018-11-28 20:29:36 Little tale 
An third world leader welcome a geologist 
"President I discovered wondrous geological deposits Oil Copper Bauxite" "Does anyone else know it" " No I keep it secret" I'm sorry for you I must kill you for the good of all"
2710 2018-11-28 20:29:35 Could be why previously NDP were anti oil before seeing the books and realizing how important it is to our economic well being. Now are as pro oil as they can be but too little too late.
2711 2018-11-28 20:29:31 My tweet was directed at glyn595's comment about watching an oil down clean up being more fun than watching Pro Stock. I thought that was the most ridiculous thing I had read that day.
2712 2018-11-28 20:29:28 Oh. Dear. Lord. 

The oil hating eco-terrorist President has had a fucking lobotomy.
2713 2018-11-28 20:29:26 #TakeYourSeat The focus needs to be on the world's animals. If we are destorying their homes just to get ahead when it is unnecessary,  we need to stop. (E.g. palm oil) Once they're gone,they're gone. Save the world's wildlife,  they are too beautiful to lose.
2714 2018-11-28 20:29:18 I tried CBD oil to see if it will help my anxiety and now I’m like sleep walking. I didn’t know that’s what was causing it at first but I am so tired and sluggish
2715 2018-11-28 20:29:17 How can Obama take credit for oil production when he said we couldn't drill our way to being the biggest producer of oil. Has he no shame??
2716 2018-11-28 20:29:15 I'd agree if Carney were acting in good faith. He predicted a bigger fall in GDP than WW2 or the GFC, the three day week or the 1973 oil crisis. And he timed it to coincide with May's desperate attempt to get Parliament onside. Hugely unprofessional
2717 2018-11-28 20:28:51 How is it Obama was instrumental in the Paris Accord on climate change then publically takes credit for the oil boom? Different sides of a two headed coin?
2718 2018-11-28 20:28:38 I believe in getting cheaper oil from Iraq...
2719 2018-11-28 20:28:36 Lol yeah I went through a phase where I did this with baby oil but I just have to get back to it lol.
2720 2018-11-28 20:28:34 Rub some oil on it usually helps when mine starts itching up or Vaseline with harlemenses
2721 2018-11-28 20:28:29 The idea that there’s only one kind of energy we can use is ludicrous. But the reliance on non-renewable (whether oil or nuclear or coal) is also ludicrous. Being dependent on a finite resource is a huge risk.
2722 2018-11-28 20:28:23 So I got into Oil painting. But now advanced drawing has been cancelled and figure drawing is overseated. Lol
2723 2018-11-28 20:28:23 When you get to my age every pop up is to be celebrated 
2724 2018-11-28 20:28:21 @AndrewScheer You have lots  to say about carbon tax and oil industry in the west.... That’s great but how about getting on this UN migration pact?  That’s a little more pressing at this time.  Stand up man.
2725 2018-11-28 20:28:18 Good Obama!in my Matins(morning prayers for non Catholics) I forgot to thank Obama for the sun rising today. You see the oil would be pumped and than go no where because O would block the pipelines.
2726 2018-11-28 20:28:17 "Motor oil free food photography"
2727 2018-11-28 20:28:15 I know but they didn’t do an oil change lol
2728 2018-11-28 20:28:04 He just took great for the oil & gas boom here in the U.S. - source: Washington @WashTimes
2729 2018-11-28 20:28:03 can they show it in action? make Iran oil expensive just like Shah did?
2730 2018-11-28 20:27:56 Independent oil rich nation that has a good work/life balance because it gives a shit about human beings.
2731 2018-11-28 20:27:52 Why don't we build the pipelines ourselves and ship the oil in them? Can't imagine why you wouldn't mount legal action and get busy to quash the resistance to the legal rights we have. Buying rail cars is a waste of money.
2732 2018-11-28 20:27:47 Oil money is too tempting mate. Even I would have stayed.
2733 2018-11-28 20:27:44 Notice the obvious silence from all of those fact checkers?
2734 2018-11-28 20:27:43 & they're palm oil free which is always a nice touch
2735 2018-11-28 20:27:40 Come on Sri, this govt has been fairly populist. Fiscal was 4.4% when they took over, don’t forget the oil bonanza. Agreed banking was a mess (the only place where they didn’t act in time) but overall their performance on econ is average imo. They messed up big time.
2736 2018-11-28 20:27:28 Wow clove oil sucks
2737 2018-11-28 20:27:26 tell the truth Andy if this oil deal had not happened to Alberta you would care less - you are not for all of Canada - GM move due to your pal Ford's slash and burn policies
2738 2018-11-28 20:27:19 Lol it’s a trespass on the land they paid money for, dude.
2739 2018-11-28 20:27:18 Disgraceful tackle from Veratti! Surprise surprise there’s no red though for the oil baron’s club
2740 2018-11-28 20:27:12 So I have to wear everything two sizes bigger. The rain and cold make it worse so I'm always wrapped in a heat pad at the back and a heated blanket at the front. I do think cutting all dairy helped a lot. Apparently cannabis oil is marvellous for it but obviously not avail yet
2741 2018-11-28 20:27:04 Not to mention she took no money from big oil or big gas, and no corporate pac money. That money was almost all from small donors like me, who gave her about $150 bucks over a year. Her opponent took money from Trump, Koch’s, the NRA, Sheldon Adelson, for starters. No thanks.
2742 2018-11-28 20:26:57 Hey Barry, the US being a leading oil producer,  yeah...YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT !!!
2743 2018-11-28 20:26:56 Made them myself. Just plonked a healthy teaspoon of marmite in the hot oil. 
2744 2018-11-28 20:26:55 Can you fry avocado oil?
2745 2018-11-28 20:26:53 More BS from the worst POTUS ever... Obama did everything possible to constrain oil production on federal lands, the increase came from what happened on private/state lands (mostly fracking). Obama taking credit for increased oil production is a joke...like he was/is.
2746 2018-11-28 20:26:47 It's interesting that the person that was once adamantly opposed to pipelines now realizes she's done in a few months and becomes not only an advocate of pipelines but also oil by rail, a far more expensive, dangerous, and GHG intensive method of transport. Oh the desperation.
2747 2018-11-28 20:26:45 @PurinaUK could you let me know if you use palm oil in you cat foods and if so is it from a sustainable source?
2748 2018-11-28 20:26:45 Pls who blocked me
2749 2018-11-28 20:26:40 Faudrait peut-être sortir du périphérique ! A la campagne, la marche a pied, le vélo et le bus, ca n’a pas de sens. En auront : Les voitures autonomes partagées peut etre demain. En attendant, la voiture électrique, c’est une tres bonne solution. Faut aider les prix à baisser.
2750 2018-11-28 20:26:39 Neymar with the contractually required in-game boot change, but oil money is ruining football
2751 2018-11-28 20:26:37 ...It is the  US Commander in chief speaking and the market should take his yesterday's Washington Post interview accordingly. The US oil production is at its highest...
2752 2018-11-28 20:26:35 So much oil in the ground and so cold into school. This regime had to leave as soon as possible
2753 2018-11-28 20:26:25 Maybr it time to use a spray on like the tanning sprays. I guess this is the old fashion way of getting the oil on evenly??? Who knows. But fuck that! Aint nobody spitting on me 
2754 2018-11-28 20:26:23 The ONLY ‘oil boom’ Obama was responsible for was the BP ‘oil booming’ into the Gulf of Mexico.
2755 2018-11-28 20:26:20 These debates are often framed in absolutes. Following this for many years and seeing effects personally it's a very multifaceted subject though if you veiw it emotionally it seems simple.
2756 2018-11-28 20:26:20 Most entertaining line from @RachelNotley's speech today, about pipeline opponents demanding an immediate end to all oil and gas use: "I'm a New Democrat from Alberta and back home we ride horses, not unicorns." #ableg #oott
2757 2018-11-28 20:26:15 Hmm. Good point. Let's start with cutting subsidys for oil companies and car companies like @GM They took American tax dollars to survive and closing plants here and moving everything to Mexico.
2758 2018-11-28 20:26:08 they expensive af smh which is why companies invented vegetable oil to begin with...gotta keep those shareholders happy. But you only get one life gotta decide whats worth it. They sellin it but i promise you they not eating it.
2759 2018-11-28 20:26:07 Is this oil pastels?
2760 2018-11-28 20:26:06 Count me among the few poor souls that cannot live like the rest of you royalty. I am allergic to peanuts and Chick-fil-A uses peanut oil to fry all of their chicken.
2761 2018-11-28 20:25:55 just oven roasted veggies and potatoes and FORGOT OIL. rip my lil dry burnt friends
2762 2018-11-28 20:25:52 That arab oil money just made sure Veratti didn't get sent off
2763 2018-11-28 20:25:51 What, with the filthy oil money and all.
2764 2018-11-28 20:25:49 It was pass under his presidency, the republicans gave Obama the kitchen sink and everything else just to get the export of oil!
2765 2018-11-28 20:25:46 The biggest wealth transfer is the military and it's our addiction to oil that costs us hundred of billions of dollars every year in military expenses. 

Electric vehicles get us off of foreign oil and subsidies pay themselves back ten-fold.
2766 2018-11-28 20:25:39 We can only produce oil when prices are sky high.  Fracking is expensive and environmentally dangerous.  Fact
2767 2018-11-28 20:25:34 Oil
Brent crude fell by US$1.45 or 2.4% to US$58.76 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US$1.27 or 2.5% to US$50.29 a barrel.

2768 2018-11-28 20:25:27 Mattie is full of prepared SHIT, doing his masters bidding where MBS is concerned, the Criminal-in-chief makes a personal fortune off the Saudis. It’s total BS that America NEEDS Saudi oil. We don’t. We do need Canada’s oil, & T goes out of his way to insult our neighbors, allies
2769 2018-11-28 20:25:18 I did put castor oil on my brows and they did grow! I'll try this
2770 2018-11-28 20:25:07 And how by high fructose CS and hydrogenated vegetable oil affects it too lol
2771 2018-11-28 20:24:43 I think that oil is amla oil , samson must still con the people out of their money before his character dies
2772 2018-11-28 20:24:41 Ducks Have The Worst Personality Of All Animals. Ducks Aren't Even In The Top 3 Meats. Ducks Are Also In The Pockets Of Big Oil.
2773 2018-11-28 20:24:38 Do they have oil?
2774 2018-11-28 20:24:27 Politicians & Corporations have kept the world enslaved to fossil fuels as a means of maintaining power & control. If you control the oil, you control the world. Climate change denial has nothing to do with disbelieving the science.
2775 2018-11-28 20:24:27 I was literally that “calling your dad when you’re getting an oil change bc...” meme  and he was waiting for me to call. Lmao
2776 2018-11-28 20:24:23 Thank you boo! I used my olive oil eco Styler gel
2777 2018-11-28 20:24:13 Guns made of traditional emulsions are so much better than those made from modern soybean oil byproducts.
2778 2018-11-28 20:24:12 Why? No

Dude put some shirt on with ur Vaseline and coconut oil looking ass
2779 2018-11-28 20:24:09 Unbelievable Jeff - the squeaky wheel always gets the oil
2780 2018-11-28 20:23:56 Wow Geo Bush actually gets credit.   No one thinks Obama helped our oil industry.
2781 2018-11-28 20:23:54 Yeah, we have that too. From my experience, coconut oil is the best
2782 2018-11-28 20:23:50 @BarackObama didn't do jack squat for the oil industry. Only since natural gas has been found, no thanks to liberal documentaries to the contrary, were we in this position. Ask anyone in the industry-Obama's policies were the albatross around their necks.
2783 2018-11-28 20:23:46 Sure. But not culpable for the same thing. The CEO is responsible for the drilling of oil, but the consumer is responsible for burning it. He should be penalized for what he did, not what we did with it.  Otherwise it's like charging the Marlboro Man with murder.
2784 2018-11-28 20:23:45 We had a Hyundai and the transmission went before our first oil change.
2785 2018-11-28 20:23:43 She calls ngos nazis. She and her backers are funded by a russian georgian oil billionaire oligarch. She blames georgians for russia invading georgia. If she geopolitically victim blames and stifles channels for change, how can we expect her to advance womens initiatives?
2786 2018-11-28 20:23:42 Oga shoot your shot if you want to, I hv a gf , check my header.
2787 2018-11-28 20:23:42 Fish oil head
2788 2018-11-28 20:23:37 Moscow remains Kiev's most important commercial partner, with Ukraine totally dependent on Russian oil and gas.

#crazyboots
2789 2018-11-28 20:23:29 It was literally 2 sticks of celery, 2 carrots, cooked in a little oil until aromatic, add 1.5 litres vegetable stock, 750g of cooked mushrooms and then I let it cool for a couple of hours, added cream and slowly reheated, stirring often so it didn’t split.
2790 2018-11-28 20:23:22 Of course he does... Nothing suprising, both countries being the greatest allies of all time, besides the UK... Just until their oil is no longer needed, then they will drop the Saudis like an unwanted child...
2791 2018-11-28 20:23:20 When you say “diversify the economy”, you really mean moving away from oil, not supporting a vital industry which is our most effective engine of prosperity. I see no other oil nation transitioning away from oil. If you won’t support AB oil, AB won’t support you. Period.
2792 2018-11-28 20:23:19 Majority of these caravaners are not valuable in an economic sense and will be a drain. On the other hand skilled ppl leaving some countries constitutes a brain drain on the country itself which is other side of the coin.
2793 2018-11-28 20:23:19 You want to try Wetherspoons pubs where you’ll often be told that hot oil destroys gluten & not to worry about the old bits of breadcrumbs & batter in the fryers as it sinks to the bottom..this seems to have been passed down from senior management
#glutenfree #allergy #scary
2794 2018-11-28 20:23:18 Obama is still lying. In fact, he stop off shore drilling and place one regulation after another on oil drilling . Narcissistic thug.
2795 2018-11-28 20:23:10 So, a huge portion of our economy relies on the oil and gas industry. Where exactly do we rely on cartels?
2796 2018-11-28 20:23:09 W truffle oil mmmmm f me up
2797 2018-11-28 20:23:05 Obama is not the reason that America is the biggest oil producer. That was @realDonaldTrump . Obama was trying to go green and was closing down any sort of fossil fuels. Kiss my ass Obama it wasn't you
2798 2018-11-28 20:23:05 Am I the only person that thinks @JustinTrudeau and all these environmental groups are jumping for joy with this talk of keeping oil in the ground ! After all turdeau did say he wanted to stop canadas oil patch and get us of it . Sad sad times
2799 2018-11-28 20:23:01 What is it about frying with rapeseed oil that makes the whole house smell like a warm mortuary? 
2800 2018-11-28 20:22:59 @RachelNotley as long as you invest in oil as your resource you will be second best. When you move on and develop another resource within Alberta that doesn't involve fossil fuel you will be giving Alberta a chance to rise. Until then you will struggle and not win
2801 2018-11-28 20:22:59 Who funds this shower of amateurs from the IEA ? Tobacco , oil , pharma . US right wing Spiv tank
2802 2018-11-28 20:22:58 Oh, I see now. Thanks, that explains why the first chart is so surprising to me. Still though, they’ve gotten rich largely off of us buying oil from them. We can bend the arms of other UN nations to put embargoes on Saudi Arabia and China.
2803 2018-11-28 20:22:57 The European Union and Federica Mogherini failed to guarantee the sale of clandestine oil to the clerical regime.

Rotivers: The EU's financial channel with Iran may not cover oil sales
France and Germany are expected to jointly take responsibility 
#StopBackingIranRegime
2804 2018-11-28 20:22:48 the main tipping point is the US dollar ties with oil, if that goes, there will be major change. the US dollar will lose more then half its value, the rich stand to lose trillions over night.
2805 2018-11-28 20:22:37 Ghana, a country almost a similar economic status as Uganda, started it's OFFSHORE exploration long after Uganda & they r at the verge of commercial production. It's interesting the that presidents of Ghana never said of the country's oil, MY OIL, like the sage of Rwakitura did.
2806 2018-11-28 20:22:33 Hi Karrie, We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. I will pass on your feedback about this to our Food Team. All the best, Jake.
2807 2018-11-28 20:22:33 the reason my hair has so much volume is because i don’t use shampoo or conditioner i just rub straight oil into my scalp and hope for the best
2808 2018-11-28 20:22:32 President Barack Obama gave the United States of America the largest deposit of oil in recent history.  He gave us Deep Water Horizon.
2809 2018-11-28 20:22:28 This guy stopped at every turn to produce more oil !! He needs a medical intervention!!
2810 2018-11-28 20:22:26 Also seen films on Almond farms in USA (not good for the bees) palm oil production in Brazil and many others.  Saving animals great trashing planet for your daily nut burger and soya milk also great?
2811 2018-11-28 20:22:25 Hmm. You should go around Texas and Oklahoma and preach that. Do you know anything about #fracking ? All these oil companies doing that for a while and it's causing earthquakes too.
2812 2018-11-28 20:22:23 #UKOG RNS

HH-1 is commercially viable. Consequently, following completion of the KL4 EWT, continued test production of a commingled KL3 and KL4 oil stream is planned.
2813 2018-11-28 20:22:18 I do the same, love the smell of gun oil!
2814 2018-11-28 20:22:11 Exfoliate and use coconut oil init. It will feel weird for a bit
2815 2018-11-28 20:22:09 Maybe but fuck psg is even stronger. Need those oil lords in Europa with Tottenham lol
2816 2018-11-28 20:22:05 Minister, it’s difficult to take this seriously when the liberal government just spent billions to but up an oil pipeline. Climate change needs action, but not that kind of action!
2817 2018-11-28 20:22:02 Wicked! Don't forget to rub coconut oil on when you start to heal to prevent scarring. Really, any oil can work as long as it's rich in omega fatty acids to penetrate and moisturize the skin so it can restore your skin's glow.
2818 2018-11-28 20:22:00 Run-of-the-mill paid infiltrators.  The fascist right wing has been using this strategy (paying off infiltrators, agitators, etc.) for years.  During the oil pipeline protest a couple of years ago a guy paid by the oil cartel was caught infiltrating the protesters, with a gun.
2819 2018-11-28 20:21:57 False flags for oil and gas revenue
2820 2018-11-28 20:21:56 Man is the energy, oil, sun water, fire, wind alternative energy.
2821 2018-11-28 20:21:52 TR established the framework, and engaged in some legitimate trust busting (see: Standard Oil and Swift & Co. cases), but couldn't push far enough thanks to conservative pressure and political alliances. What sort of lunatic wanted to regulate insurance companies? TR.
2822 2018-11-28 20:21:41 there was a video on photography hacks and someone put cardboard in between each pancake to make the stacks higher and engine oil as syrup to make the pancakes less soggy
2823 2018-11-28 20:21:41 Article makes sense but what if the beef farmers owned the hamburger joints in the US.  If the big oil own the state refineries.. are they really complaining??
2824 2018-11-28 20:21:38 Olive oil and salt and pepper and bake it in the oven it smacks
2825 2018-11-28 20:21:31 Oil is not looking healthy at all.  Telling a much different story than the SP-500.  What one is right?
2826 2018-11-28 20:21:25 Not worth it! They've not stockpiled the correct stuff. Where's the olive oil? The foie gras? Champers? Olives (only one jar!?!) Camembert? A variety of Spanish hams? Very disappointed in them.
2827 2018-11-28 20:21:21 Paris Saint Germain and sadly we're a goal down. Looks like the devil is working overtime tonight. Oh well, I have my holy water and anointing oil with me so we die here. . On a second thought, we don't die here please.

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2831 2018-11-28 20:21:14 He is the world's largest snake oil vendor the only oil he knows about
2832 2018-11-28 20:20:58 WTI oil falls to lowest level since October 2017 ... $50.43/barrel.
2833 2018-11-28 20:20:51 I've been working in oil & Gas for 11 yrs & the money is really good. Need more drivers though
2834 2018-11-28 20:20:38 If you can’t drain the swamp cover it with oil light and@stand back.
2835 2018-11-28 20:20:38 Once you not giving us the glue and motor oil treatment I good
2836 2018-11-28 20:20:34 Do you want that problem now or later? We need to reorganize our economy around stuff other than oil. The environment doesn't care how we structured the dollar.
2837 2018-11-28 20:20:25 Coconut oil. Really, any oil can work as long as it's rich in omega fatty acids to penetrate and moisturize the skin so it can restore your skin's glow.
2838 2018-11-28 20:20:23 US is biggest oil producer NOT because of Obama but in spite of him.  All that land grabbing..
2839 2018-11-28 20:20:22 Bro i been tryna get my oil changed for 6 days now and them mf are lackin
2840 2018-11-28 20:20:18 Chart to the left is a pull showing what people THINK.
Chart to the right demonstrates the ACTUAL oil imports.
2841 2018-11-28 20:20:11 Omg @mustbejp I found truffle oil in Lidl and am using it in everything. Mashed potato tonight xx
2842 2018-11-28 20:20:05 Which @oil @crude co's are likely to run into credit issues and which are quite likely to see credit downgrades based on fall in price of product

2843 2018-11-28 20:19:57 I repeat.  The world has to reduce fossil fuel use 3x-5x to meet Paris Agreement.  And supply side caps are a valid approach to forcing that.  Several other countries have put a kibosh on further oil exploration.
2844 2018-11-28 20:19:41 Well true to a degree but acne clearly indicate the health of ur body. Maybe ur not drinking enough water, unhealthy food, food w too much oil, ur not washing ur face so dirt n oil accumulates, touching ur face w dirty hands, etc..
2845 2018-11-28 20:19:31 honestly all these tweets about pancake ads being cardboard and motor oil are so funny to me because my mom makes the food for photoshoots like these for a living and the reality is so, so much worse
2846 2018-11-28 20:19:29 Oil now is in the hands of three countries, or to be more precise two countries and a guy with a phone, #Saudi #Russia and Trump

2847 2018-11-28 20:19:26 @RachelNotley keep Alberta's dirty bitumen where you keep your head buried in the ground. BC will never accept the TMX pipeline no matter how you bluster. Move on from oil revenue and develop alternatives for your people oils day is done.
2848 2018-11-28 20:19:23 Charlatan of the highest order. NRB’d from Oil Industry and soon he will be gone as an MP
2849 2018-11-28 20:19:20 I hope not. I’ve just ordered a bottle of CBD oil for my dog, he gets SOOOO distressed 
2850 2018-11-28 20:19:20 yeah you gotta put water in hot oil for it to work
2851 2018-11-28 20:19:14 Just got new tires now it’s time for a oil change like I need a break
2852 2018-11-28 20:19:13 Oil's already plummeting in price due to weak world economy. Electric cars suck balls, & the world will soon collapse to a primitive level because of limits to growth. The only consolation is that knuckle dragging warmongers will also be destroyed.
2853 2018-11-28 20:19:06 May be time to go long oil here

2857 2018-11-28 20:18:56 Why wouldn’t you want the oil merchants in Europa?
2858 2018-11-28 20:18:54 Who wanna pay for me to get an oil change? It’s the season to give ain’t it?
2859 2018-11-28 20:18:52 Yup...we have the same issue here in BC where we buy oil from the south. Sometimes our provincial & federal gov can't get things right. This is why we need a national plan incase we stop trading with China & open to UK. @JustinTrudeau get your act together.
2860 2018-11-28 20:18:52 3 and 1/2 years ago, 10 days before my 21st birthday, i got arrested for having 336 grams of weed and 31.6 grams of hash oil. Today I got that felony conviction dismissed. Can’t even put into words how I feel. So grateful #yay
2861 2018-11-28 20:18:51 Iono who fqkn my ex now, but let him know im still fqkn n she need her oil changed
2862 2018-11-28 20:18:39 Wasn't most of the oil being drilled on private land?  Which he couldn't touch.  And didn't he stop offshore drilling?  Which impacted the oil industry negatively. Just another example of Obama trying to take credit, where none exists.
2863 2018-11-28 20:18:31 Obama opposed fracking at every opportunity. He supported every effort to outlaw it.
But when the #FakeNews about its risks was exposed, fracking led to an oil boom that Obama tried to counter by huge subsidies for non fossil fuel industry.
Now he wants the credit.
2864 2018-11-28 20:18:19 It’s funny how a company can tell you that you have a free tire rotation and oil change then the next day say oops we were wrong you don’t have a free one...then charge you $70.
2865 2018-11-28 20:18:17 I would take the UN more seriously if they didn't have Saudi Arabia as head of the UN Human Rights Council (Saudi Arabia being one country that regularly executes LGBT people).
I guess the UN likes that sweet sweet Arab oil cash too much to care about principles.
2866 2018-11-28 20:18:17 See the issues building some NG pipeline from Northern PA to New England? 300 miles to substitute Heating Oil. Not happening.
2867 2018-11-28 20:18:10 OIL MONEY FC FTWWWW
2868 2018-11-28 20:18:10 Oil is just heading where it is supposed to go in the ongoing deflationary bust.
2869 2018-11-28 20:18:07 Many are in low skill jobs, dont move up. The solution we are told is to artificially increase wages, or import ppl that dont complain. 
It's true more jobs than QUALIFIED ppl to fill them. Most dont actually require degrees, just skill training
2870 2018-11-28 20:18:07 I have always supported Alberta & advocated buying Canadian oil & boycotting Saudi oil. I support pipelines. And I am disappointed that some of my Alberta followers are dismissing the suffering of Ontario as we cope with ongoing plant closures. It is not a contest of suffering.
2871 2018-11-28 20:18:06 I’ve been saying turn off the tap for a while!! 3 billion barrels a day as discount??  Shut that free trump oil off!!  I know it’s not that easy but something needs done!!  Like let me make some pipe here in Regina for you. 
2872 2018-11-28 20:18:03 Y’all tried the Cannabis Sativa Oil Eco Styler Gel ????
2873 2018-11-28 20:18:00 Huh?  The huge explosion in oil production under Obama's years was done on private, not federal land.  He did almost everything it could to try and hinder it.
2874 2018-11-28 20:17:53 Was supposed to get heating oil today but like... 1600h and no truck has shown up :I
2875 2018-11-28 20:17:51 I say half-joke cause I don't think the guy thinks it's a good idea, but was making a valid point that it would at least be consistent with the idea that investing in a publicly-owned pipeline to protect the Alberta oil industry is smart.
2876 2018-11-28 20:17:34 I would take the UN more seriously if they didn't have Saudi Arabia as head of the UN Human Rights Council (Saudi Arabia being one country that regularly executes LGBT people).

2882 2018-11-28 20:17:03 But Buhari is still prospecting oil in the Chad Basin, wasting resources that could have been used in improving education. Can't we all see that the old man is stuck in doing things the old way?
2883 2018-11-28 20:17:02 I hear squalane oil works really well. But for some reason, the niacinimade and zinc from ordinary really helped my brother?
2884 2018-11-28 20:17:01 How different is Pres Trump from former Pres. Obama? Obama just stated the US produced more oil during his term than ever. Did that help combat CC (warming)?
2885 2018-11-28 20:17:00 Good oil change I love the way my shit ride afterwards
2886 2018-11-28 20:16:57 There's a Swiss cream called Kelosoft, advised for keloid scars +regular scars.. It seems to work and it would be on the low end of treatment. High end is a dermabrasion combo glycolic acid scrub+toner. Also tea tree oil when there's a fresh pimple
2887 2018-11-28 20:16:48 INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat the oven to 180c, line a muffin tray with 12 silicone or paper cases.
In a large bowl mix together the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda and ground cinnamon with a spoon.
In another bowl add the melted coconut oil & light brown sugar & mix with a fork.

2890 2018-11-28 20:16:34 Oh yes, some sauteed spinach would be a nice and nutritious addition to lunch today! Let fill this entire pan up with a whole bag of spinach, add some oil, turn the heat on, a little salt, and 30 seconds later my teaspoon of spinach is ready to eat.
2891 2018-11-28 20:16:32 Oblaba did NOTHING for Oil or for the economy. He nearly caused America to FAIL for all time. That's what the democrats want.
2892 2018-11-28 20:16:26 Have you taken a look at oil prices? It’s sitting at $51 US, and most likely will fall further. When Rachel Notely took over it was falling. It doesn’t matter what party was leader, there would still be the same problems.
2893 2018-11-28 20:16:25 Damn it...make her your girlfriend chief
2894 2018-11-28 20:16:21 I will have your palm oil free variety as long as you pay the correct amount of tax.

2902 2018-11-28 20:16:06 now that is a shiny rear... might buy some oil to use for my gf
2903 2018-11-28 20:16:06 An oil business specialist on went on @PnPCBC  a while ago calling for the creation of an emergency mediation panel on the building of pipelines.  This Panel should include respected political & business members. Let's get it done. J. Kenney could lead the initiative if he dares.
2904 2018-11-28 20:16:04 TONNINO in olive oil is the best !

2906 2018-11-28 20:15:49 Why don't we go green..solar power..get rid of coal..use oil and gas sparingly..that can be done now!!!
2907 2018-11-28 20:15:42 Based on the charts I saw he is actually correct (except 2016 it went down).  What I will say is they went up despite him because he did everything he could to thwart oil production
2908 2018-11-28 20:15:42 I love cardboard and motor oil
2909 2018-11-28 20:15:39 It's my answer for everything. Clean motorbike chain? Paraffin. Oil spill? Paraffin. Rusted crap? Paraffin and oil mix. Thirsty? Paraffin. Makeshift napalm? Paraffin and washing up liquid.
2910 2018-11-28 20:15:38 It’s because he loves Russian oil and oligarchs as much as Trump!
2911 2018-11-28 20:15:36 Universals oh universals we exhaust the deserts and coasts we decorate oil rig isles with flowers What holy men ship us messages for our kiddies from Roche-Carre To us the water is thick with hunting blinds with space with our homes our bodies.

1.5 tsp baking powder
0.5 tsp baking soda
0.5 tsp ground cinnamon

1 medium red apple, grated
2914 2018-11-28 20:15:23 I seem to remember Hussein doing everything possible to get rid of fossil fuels, not try to make us a player in the world oil market. He just needs to go away, but he's too arrogant to realize it.
2915 2018-11-28 20:15:16 I know multiple versions of this story, some even worse off, and it is a daily source of grief to me. It will only get worse with time, but our entire culture makes money selling snake oil.
2916 2018-11-28 20:15:07 The cheapest oil you could use in South Africa. Extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil are more superior
2917 2018-11-28 20:15:00 Does my sassiness upset you?

2919 2018-11-28 20:14:53 Goal for our fellow oil club 
2920 2018-11-28 20:14:52 Use coconut oil!
2921 2018-11-28 20:14:47 WUT??? 
During his 2012 State of the Union speech, Barack Obama  claimed “American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight  years.”
  In fact, Congressional Research Service reports that 96% of the increase comes from oil fields out of Obama’s control. #ObamaLIES
2922 2018-11-28 20:14:45 me and light skin girls are like oil and water

2925 2018-11-28 20:14:35 Hate waiting at the dealership  never again will I buy their oil changes
2926 2018-11-28 20:14:33 Tak try lagi yang balancing oil tu. Sama lah. Dulu simple hydrating tu my fav. Dah habis tu, try cosmoderm. Breakout terok!!! Pakai balik simple, dia jadi panas2 and tak tahu kenapa. Now pakai organic aid (asyik berpeluh je). So tak jumpa lagi moist yang sesuai. Huhuhu.
2927 2018-11-28 20:14:32 There will also be no shortage of snake oil. Michael Gove has plenty to sell.
2928 2018-11-28 20:14:32 Sound about right for Canada. That $$ is for housing (1st, last, & damage deposit) furniture, setting up utilities ie oil for heat, groceries, clothing, transportation, medication. Certainly can eat up $ 3874. in a hurry. How would you manage @realDonaldTrump as an immigrant.
2929 2018-11-28 20:14:29 Oil is not a moisturizer foolyou need actual lotion
2930 2018-11-28 20:14:25 You hate oil - you like oil ?  Huh?
2931 2018-11-28 20:14:23 You know, given what he did for gun sales by pounding that industry...maybe he has a point about oil. He hated them just as much...
2932 2018-11-28 20:14:14 Modern day, political Snake Oil.
With a healthy helping of political Sales of Indulgences.
2933 2018-11-28 20:14:11 I've heard of most of those Corsi conspiracy theories, but "oil does not come from organic matter" is a new one...

2935 2018-11-28 20:14:08 What resources??? North Sea oil will run out in ten years, shipbuilding contracts will be moved to Plymouth.
No more free prescriptions, no more free university places and a relief from Scotlands huge benefits costs.

But we love you and want you to stay 
2936 2018-11-28 20:14:06 Very interesting. Perhaps manufacturing is next course of action. Most often plastic produce in China overflood our market. Some have questionable lead content. Also brexit give us opportunity to trade oil with UK. So all hope is not lost if gov willing to make it happen
2937 2018-11-28 20:14:02 Okay we know we have two official languages! We also know we have an Oil Crisis! Let’s pull the trigger on TMPipeline and start making money!
2938 2018-11-28 20:13:54 if we told all of congress and rich people that they have a chance to sell their oil stock and buy sustainable energy stock before passing a climate change reform, would that solve all our problems
2939 2018-11-28 20:13:54 I'm certain rUK will still want our oil,gas,soft fruits whisky, world class beef and lamb salmon shellfish ok I'm going to stop now the list is too long, We'll make a good deal with rUK with Europe at our back
We'll be laughing
2940 2018-11-28 20:13:53 We have observed an unusually high crude #oil volume originating in the Das Island area off the coast of Abu Dhabi. In the past, ship-to-ship crude oil and other petroleum transfers have occurred in the area. It is possible this crude is Iranian.  #OPEC #OOTT #ClipperData

2947 2018-11-28 20:13:29 Actually I belong to the nuclear cult but nobody pays attention to the most reliable cleanest energy there is so I’m stuck with oil until people get their head out of their as.
2948 2018-11-28 20:13:26 WV needs someone to restore our state.  Under Trump & Justice our beautiful hills have been torn down & replaced with oil & gas drilling for China. I cannot believe our federal government would have allowed this destruction. Trump makes many visits to WV & sees it all !
2949 2018-11-28 20:13:19 If your coupling immigration generally with socioeconomic policy you have to examine it in a macro way. One set of policies directly working counter to others doesnt contribute to overall sucess

2960 2018-11-28 20:12:35 Danielle Smith @ABDanielleSmith The US made a deal with domestic oil producers to supply discounted oil to domestic refineries and blocked the export of Crude for 40 years 1974-2015. I wonder if importing from the world market was…
2961 2018-11-28 20:12:35 someone pick me up from the dealership & i’ll buy you lunch meanwhile my car gets an oil change <333
2962 2018-11-28 20:12:34 That's what she sa(dies for Bush's oil profits)
2963 2018-11-28 20:12:34 maybe oil can tell what this really is, nothing is different.
2964 2018-11-28 20:12:30 Ladies, if you really wanna turn heads when you walk in a room, purchase a bottle of Amber oil from Whole Foods. Thank me later.
2965 2018-11-28 20:12:29 Should've been done before they told the power company to drop their rates. May surprise some how expensive on-island oil generation is. #renewables #SolarEnergy
2966 2018-11-28 20:12:22 @Morrisons do all your own brand products that contain palm oil only use responsibly sourced palm oil?

2967 2018-11-28 20:12:19 Try this for brunch tomorrow? Salmon fillet and cabbage pan-fried with parmiagiana cheese. Serve on top of cooked risotto in olive oil.
2968 2018-11-28 20:12:18  preach the word of God then, no spoil them kpata kpata
2969 2018-11-28 20:12:18 Govt. intervention? Yes make a law so you can't sell the oil at such a steep discount................ #cdnpoli #pnpcbc #BNN #abpoli #ableg #Sask #keystonexl
2970 2018-11-28 20:12:18 If I asked Nestle Water to fill up a barrel directly out of their mountain spring, they'd charge more than what Canadian Select oil is going for today.... #oil #abpoli #yyc
2971 2018-11-28 20:12:14 Its WWE (scripted).DJT was made by the tabloids, Hollywood & media (who is it that runs those or is that too impolite). Trump just admitted that the US remains in the ME for Israel, not oil.He's appointed GoldSachs to his cabinet, violated his camp promises on Afghan & Syria.Why?
2972 2018-11-28 20:12:08 The oil checker finisher
2973 2018-11-28 20:12:05 Is weed more profitable than cars?????????? Osawa get green & kiss cars goodbye this might be the direction we were supposed to go dragging an oil industry that set against us is futile
2974 2018-11-28 20:11:56 I'm allergic to rapeseed oil, most places have no idea if it is in the food or not, lots just say they don't use it, but then I get the specific symptoms of having eaten the poison. It needs to be added to the allergens list, lots of people are allergic to it. #bbcwatchdog
2975 2018-11-28 20:11:56 Really?  Their styles seem uncomplementary, like oil & water.  Guess I'm not a fan of synth-pop.  I like my @Nadasurf pure & unadulterated.
2976 2018-11-28 20:11:39 Yeah. It was all a bit of a publicity stunt by the National Gas Oil Engine Company.
2977 2018-11-28 20:11:39 @sainsburys do all your own brand products that contain palm oil only use responsibly sourced palm oil?

#DitchDirtyPalmOil
2978 2018-11-28 20:11:37 Again oil bust. Most of the drivers for crime was breaking and entering and possession of stolen items. Not hard to relate the two. BTW crime was up in 9 of the provinces. You know, ones Rachel Notley wasn’t in charge of.
2979 2018-11-28 20:11:34 President and CEO of Athabasca Oil (on BNN) complains about regulations and pipelines, then asks for government regulation (government-mandated production cuts) and we got government action in the form of a pipeline project purchase. #cdnpoli #abpoli
2980 2018-11-28 20:11:33 Obama was only against fracking, drilling & pipelines. Other than that, pro oil for energy.
2981 2018-11-28 20:11:28 Lmao children that are already spoilt ehn
2982 2018-11-28 20:11:27 Beto is owned by AIPAC and big oil, just like Ted Cruz. Lesser evil is still evil.
2983 2018-11-28 20:11:24 I’d recommend TSP; no more than 1/4 cup per gallon of water. Best degreaser and cleaner. Will raise the grain of the wood a little bit, but just give it a quick sand once dry. Any kind of oil may prevent the finish from adhering.

2987 2018-11-28 20:11:12 Wtf are “stoned wheat thins” what is “stoned” I don’t get it. What is “extra virgin” olive oil???? What the fuck is life???
2988 2018-11-28 20:11:10 Service 2 weeks ago and yes i frequently change my oil
2989 2018-11-28 20:11:05 "You didn't produce that oil!"

I laughed out loud.  What a pompous jokester.
2990 2018-11-28 20:11:04 Thanks for what? Obama fought the oil industry for 8 years and still fighting them.
2991 2018-11-28 20:10:59 #lfc, luckily the oil price is going down. Take that #psg
2992 2018-11-28 20:10:58 Chicken pasta and broccoli, with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. SO GOOD and easy to make. I make a gigantic pot and it’s super easy to heat up throughout the week! You can even use precooked breaded chicken and frozen broccoli if you don’t have time!
2993 2018-11-28 20:10:58 What happened to environment n oil is evil? We're you lying back then or now?
2994 2018-11-28 20:10:52 Obama is such a joke, he failed to lead the Country by "leading from behind," he tried to put the coal mining industry out of business, and refused to allow any new pipelines to be layed, and he's somehow responsible for our standing in the oil industry?? What a joke!
2995 2018-11-28 20:10:45 It's a bit worrying that oil can't seem to participate in the post-Powell bidfest for risk assets.

Doesn't mean their smart but they have billions in Oil industry  to deceive the poor & lying to the working class! Thank the Koch Brothers for starting it all! America's #1 Domestic Terrorist

3002 2018-11-28 20:10:09 The calomine actually has helped. I also went back to taking my original nighttime meds. over the 4-day weekend I switched up my routine a bit and tried some new things and that was a bad bad idea  so I’m back to pine tar soap, sesame oil all over, and calomine in spots

3004 2018-11-28 20:09:59 I read the most horrific story about an #orangutan called #pony and what the palm oil farmers did to her. I don’t even want to tell u or tweet the story as it’s so bad. Does anyone know where she is and how I can sponsor her?
3005 2018-11-28 20:09:57 Yes, this is extremely forward looking. Hundreds of thousands of very low skill, poorly educated ppl entering the country competing with citizens at only slightly higher levels for things like housing, schools, jobs. Very sound policy
3006 2018-11-28 20:09:57 It's a completely different hub than Alfine 8 (considered excellent) and slightly less reliable, although still good.  A11 Version 2 appears better than version 1 although both are rumoured to leak oil slowly.
3007 2018-11-28 20:09:55 It’s a private company in a volatile/changing industry.People who decided to pursue a career in auto knew the risks(or should have), same as oil and gas. Maybe the exploding #cannabis industry will be an option for those out of work in Ontario and throughout Canada.
3008 2018-11-28 20:09:52 They love hard boiled eggs (not scrambled) Sardines, oddly enough. Roasted chick peas are really popular. Or just on the stove top with some olive oil, salt and cumin until they get a bit crunchy.

3012 2018-11-28 20:09:31 Or if the global economy is all cleared to go to the moon why is demand for Oil down on a day like today when it should be soaring.
3013 2018-11-28 20:09:27 Wow, I had no flipping idea. Or maybe I heard a bit about it briefly. Do they need another one or something? It’s a good question, how many do we need to upgrade our oil?

3016 2018-11-28 20:09:11 Id trade you Amazon delivery for “Oil is a national resource so when the government sells it its citizens each get a paycheck”
3017 2018-11-28 20:09:10 uh no obama openly opposed the development of alternative methods to produce oil (fracking ect)
3018 2018-11-28 20:09:08 Yes Ms ignorant. We solved it over time. It wasn't the GM Butts slash and burn and kill an entire Canadian industry in a year ffs. Oh and it didn't have leakage. The rest of the (non regulated) world is picking up our slack. The world is actually WORSE of without Cdn oil!
3019 2018-11-28 20:09:04 Governments care about money so I’d imagine that oil production will stop when there isn’t any left to profit from
3020 2018-11-28 20:09:04 .Traffic has come to a halt on the Dan Ryan waiting for a passing cloud.... Sorry..., I have no 'clue' on what you are trying to say... Guess my 'vision' is on another 'level'... I only know that no one wants to go back to horses and buggies... nor oil lamps... FORWARD PLEASE.../
3021 2018-11-28 20:08:30 yea we all did thats the problem..they too high in omega 6s... for cooking stick to oils high in saturated fats like butter lard coconut oil and animal fat or monounsaturated fats like olive oil macadamia nut oil and avocado oil
3022 2018-11-28 20:08:29 Oh I know there’s been way more losses in Alberta. I don’t want to see anybody unemployed. The funny part is the gm plant shutting down is a huge result of oil being down in price. No more big trucks for workers or contracts for oil companies.
3023 2018-11-28 20:08:20 omg ... no! way! motor oil? shaving cream? what a revelation!!! yes point out every single pancake and pie advertisement like it’s the most shocking thing in the world PLEASE!
3024 2018-11-28 20:08:18 OIL 51.45 Barrel! Cheap Gas Thank You @realDonaldTrump !
3025 2018-11-28 20:08:06 The oil is clearly the biggest loss
3026 2018-11-28 20:08:05 Obama loves big oil
3027 2018-11-28 20:07:59 With almost 100% certainty I think we can both agree 9/11 was not an inside job by the KSA.They were Al Qaeda operatives of Saudi descent. 

True, the USA can get by without Saudi oil, but many of our key trading partners rely on it, especially Japan, Europe, etc. People have 1/2
3028 2018-11-28 20:07:52 The man who promised to bankrupt the coal industry & warned that electricity would “necessarily skyrocket” now wants to take credit for America’s booming oil industry. Now that’s chutzpah!

3034 2018-11-28 20:07:20 interested in facts. Let's get started! 

1) Look at every country in the world that is ran by a black or brown country. Shitholes! The exception are a few Arab countries that have a ridiculous amount of oil (Saudi Arabia, UAE). Look at every country ran by white people. For the
3035 2018-11-28 20:07:18 For sure + oil prices are terrible.  Someone much smarter and experienced than me told me to wait for $40 oil and then buy some drillers.  May not get there but ...
3036 2018-11-28 20:07:16 Sounds like we're all going to be bleeding out of our eyes in a few years.
long live the oil companies!

3040 2018-11-28 20:07:05 My husband works oil field. It was dead until Trump took office. Nice try Barry.
3041 2018-11-28 20:07:05 Unless you have an accent ... then the pronunciation is sort of the same but the point remains the same. Back in Jesus time the spices and oil were the most expensive things they could have and some couldn’t afford
3042 2018-11-28 20:07:04 Forbes 2016 on the crude oil production surge:  "it is readily apparent that it happened despite Obama's administration, and not because of it."
3043 2018-11-28 20:07:02 HE IS A PAID OIL INDUSTRY LOBBYIST! You don’t ever disclose that!!
3044 2018-11-28 20:06:56 I most definitely am an animal rights activist but I have read what the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute are doing collaborating with the oil companies to protect the wildlife & return the boreal forests to a high quality Caribou habitat, this is a priority to the ABMI

3048 2018-11-28 20:06:40 all my windshield wipers literally fell apart like 45 minutes after i changed my oil and got my blinker fixed 
3049 2018-11-28 20:06:37 If Albertans want a bigger cut of the revenues for oil shipped out of province, we should be changing the royalty structure, not imposing government control over the means of production and dictating to private sector entities at what price and how much they may sell ...
3050 2018-11-28 20:06:37 the U.S needs to stop worrying about their precious oil embargoes and STOP supporting Saudi Arabia. 85,000 children in Yemen have died from starvation in the last year, and SA will continue to tear the country apart. withdraw our troops from the yemen war. call your senators!!!!!
3051 2018-11-28 20:06:25 Don't feel bad.  They apparently don't want Americans to build American cars anymore, & suddenly the world prefers our oil & nat gas to our USTs.  Major changes are afoot & denial is not just a river in Egypt... :)

3053 2018-11-28 20:06:04 When last did you take it for servicing? And have you been changing your oil frequently?
3054 2018-11-28 20:06:04 I clean a restaurant and often used baby oil to wipe down the stainless steel items
3055 2018-11-28 20:05:59 With oil beans and soft bread can make sense.... use one cold bottle of coke to step down
3056 2018-11-28 20:05:58 If Scotland gets a rather large handout from WM, why are they so desperate to keep us? Is it all that oil, natural energy resources, whisky, food & fisheries or just a place to keep trident? We give so much to WM, they don't want to lose us! #DissolveTheUnion #indyref2
3057 2018-11-28 20:05:57 He seems to want it both ways for wasn’t he suppose to be for cutting back on fossil fuel because of climate change but now he’s the champion of oil & gas production? Cognitive dissonance, no?
3058 2018-11-28 20:05:55 I don't like government intervention as a conservative, but this is an extraordinary circumstance and supply management of our oil supply is a temporary solution to ease the differential. There is precedent for this as well (i.e. supply management in dairy.)
3059 2018-11-28 20:05:54 Not sure if I should get my car’s oil change done or buy Christmas presents 
3060 2018-11-28 20:05:47 If the poeple of Alberta doubt @RachelNotley s integrity in fighting for albertans and her dedication to exporting our oil,her agreement to ship by rail proves her willingness to fight for albertans over her NDP dogma.Kenney has never proven his love for alberta,only to be PM

3064 2018-11-28 20:05:25 It’s that rice water darling! (And melted honey & coconut oil hair masks too)
3065 2018-11-28 20:05:25 This last hour could get interesting. Markets are not always as they appear. Oil facing again, USD turning down, gold moving higher. And if the 10yr yield breaks below 3.00 watch out! We have mentioned the 10yr before and what it means.
3066 2018-11-28 20:05:23 @Edwin_Honoret you need some coconut oil and some devacurl for those curls my brotha

3068 2018-11-28 20:05:20 Small “trucks” are a favorite because people want them, especially SUV’s.   It is supply and demand, just like with oil.  And GM is closing plants due to the effects of your trade war.

3072 2018-11-28 20:05:09 Canola Oil not bad
3073 2018-11-28 20:05:07 Maybe if the left allowed us to insert some Tier One assets into these other countries, we could help alleviate the suffering and violence they face. Of course, there is no oil in Guatemala or El Salvador.
3074 2018-11-28 20:05:06 I see today that Obama is claiming credit for the boom in U.S. oil production. For once I agree with him. He is our "Fracking President", a legacy that he apparently embraces.  Politics is strange.
3075 2018-11-28 20:04:59 Need to get me some cbd oil
3076 2018-11-28 20:04:58 This coconut oil is life.
3077 2018-11-28 20:04:57 Today was so cold that a Jew went in the oven himself, a black dude sewed a sweater from the cotton he's picked, a Russian shot a beaver and wore it as a hat, an asian  installed a firewall, and an arabic dug up oil to fuel his heater.
It couldn't get more racist than this 
3078 2018-11-28 20:04:57 It doesn’t even make sense that they would steam the olives bc oil and water don’t mix...

3080 2018-11-28 20:04:46 @AliVelshi in regards to news pc about Venezuela- #1, they hv OIL. (hint) #2, USA declared them a "rogue" country, which helped to create their economic status USA, is #1 currency- get it? would love to see segment-why declared "rogue"? after 911 why not Saudi "rogue?
3081 2018-11-28 20:04:45 Of course ibama did everything he could to stop oil production. Fortunately private companies didn't pay attention to him and created the fracking boom.
3082 2018-11-28 20:04:42 @BBCWatchdog recently at Frankie & Bennys, my wife has dairy allergy and chose something classed as dairy free from their allergen list, just to be advised not to have it as it was cooked in oil that had previously had products with dairy cooked in it.point of allergen list??

3095 2018-11-28 20:03:45 Since the @DeptofDefense dumps 100s of thousands of them in the ocean not surprised more arent being washed up. As finding a landmine myself before on the east coast. Wonder what WW3 will wash up, seeing as starting wars over oil seems to be the only way the USgov remains afloat.
3096 2018-11-28 20:03:41 #GlenMoray Bourbon Palate: not getting as much burn as expected from this one - It's a sipper - don't think it needs water. Dark bitter chocolate notes with a hint of orange oil coming through as the glass get drained!
3097 2018-11-28 20:03:41 Also... unrelated — Patchouli Oil still a thing in Greenpoint huh? 
3098 2018-11-28 20:03:39 Watching too much Fox news.

Regulating emmissions didnt hurt them on the way to become world's largest producer - apparently. Noting largest increases, larger than bush or any others.

Under his admin he U.S. also removed the 40-year ban on crude oil exports
3099 2018-11-28 20:03:38 Can't say it'll work for everyone, but I had some pretty gnarly skin about a year ago. Started using the tea tree oil toner from Thursday Plantation (and Angels on Bare Skin from Lush). Not cheap, but my skin is a lot better now. 

Hope you find a solution soon!
3100 2018-11-28 20:03:36 big oil loves climate change because they see it as a way to seal small players out of the game.  Exxon Mobile loves it
3101 2018-11-28 20:03:29 Oil is yesterdays cash cow. It will still generate revenue but with US production ramping up and conversion to renewable energy it is never going to be the force it was. Thankfully the ANDP have diversified put of the UCP one trick pony strategy of all or nothing oil.
3102 2018-11-28 20:03:29 Who cares? They taste like cardboard anyway. And the motor oil is probably tastier than Aunt Jemimas
3103 2018-11-28 20:03:28 1/2 The announcement made in Oshawa regarding GM should be celebrated. Our PM has talked about phasing out emissions, eliminating the demand on oil/oilsands. This is a victory, this is a positive move into the future. We've effectively reduced a heavy carbon emitting factory AND

I suggest giving them buckets of coconut oil........................instead

Much cheaper and certainly more effective.
3109 2018-11-28 20:03:00 I went through a period in my 40s where I said David Beckham was my boyfriend. None of my family & friends believed it. To believe Trump's snake oil claims is to prove that you have no grasp of the obvious

3111 2018-11-28 20:02:51 BC premier held the project hostage until it met her 5 conditions on top of NEBs 157 conditions for approval. 
Shipping oil by tanker ship is the safest mode of transportation. This isn't the 70s anymore where spills were commonplace.
3112 2018-11-28 20:02:50 Cannabis oil works wonders...Charlotte's Web started showing that years ago
3113 2018-11-28 20:02:44 Coconut oil
3114 2018-11-28 20:02:40 He allowed the US to become a net exporter of oil. This, with better shale oil tech lead to a significant ramp up in production. This resulted in a $26 oil pb price.  This came close to leading to a debt default issue as a large % of US corporate debt is linked to oil in some way
3115 2018-11-28 20:02:36 The only oil hussien obama found was the oil dripping off mooches head....
3116 2018-11-28 20:02:28 Oil money mate 
3117 2018-11-28 20:02:22 Oil is a short term measure PERIOD.

invest in renewable energies instead of corrupt oil companies that shirk responsibility every time a pipeline spills.
3118 2018-11-28 20:02:16 I'm surprised you don't think government should act to end the loss of $4B / year of oil royalties #ableg
3119 2018-11-28 20:02:07 Didn't he strangle oil? Restrict drilling? Add moratorium???didn't he build resist oil? Resist fossil fuels. We need to keep that when he touts clean energy...we can say but you took credit for this..and this..which side cause you can't be for and against at the same time. Grand
3120 2018-11-28 20:02:05 And everybody knows that the oil is scolding
Everybody knows that it's nesting forth
3121 2018-11-28 20:01:56 Are you normal?
3122 2018-11-28 20:01:54 I work in the oil industry, when I left active duty during the Obama years, I had to work in Kazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, etc. to get work, none in USA, until he left office.  Now I can work off the Gulf of Mexico.  Hmm...
3123 2018-11-28 20:01:43 What was the price of vegetables, dals during the same time ? Also what was the fiscal deficit created by this subsidy and who is paying now for it ? Why oil bonds were given ? What's the total cost of oil bonds ?

3126 2018-11-28 20:01:31 They should have stuck with the Dems - yep she wasn’t who we wanted in some cases but you pick the one that can do less harm.  I am sickened when I watch the rallies - snake Oil all the way - they came out and voted Republican in the senate races ! Lord help us!
3127 2018-11-28 20:01:30 She was grasping at straws. A tv station vs climate change (because they export oil)?! When the funs are killing people she doesnt say the NRA at fault 
3128 2018-11-28 20:01:25 Well, there are some who *are* in the pocket of big oil just like decades ago there were many in the pocket of big tobacco who argued there was no link between cancer and smoking. But in general, I think we could all use a little more reasonable debate on a number of issues.
3129 2018-11-28 20:01:14 "But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, I invented oil... so you’re welcome”
3130 2018-11-28 20:01:12 Yeah, we know Doug, you’ve said this before, many times, trying to take credit for the market price of oil. You still haven’t explained what the Ontario Conservative Government plans to do to combat climate change. WHEN  do we see a your government’s plan?
3131 2018-11-28 20:01:07 Take her to a warm tropical island and rub her down with some tanning oil . I love a woman that smells like a pina colada .
3132 2018-11-28 20:01:00 Dehydration, probably! Try something with hyalauronic acid and maybe add in a light oil, like rosehip, before moisturizing.
3133 2018-11-28 20:00:56 It wasn't you president Obama on the contrary the restrictions that you imposed on the oil and coal industry crippled the United States of America,we can thank president Trump for removing them and making our country an oil, gas and coal exporter for frist time in a century.

3140 2018-11-28 20:00:09 Premier Rachel Notley tells me she’ll make decision about cutting oil production levels within a week. Doesn’t rule out Jason Kenney suggestion for 10% mandatory cut. #cdnpoli #ableg
3141 2018-11-28 20:00:06 Gotta love that motor oil
3142 2018-11-28 20:00:01 He did though. He changed legislation to allow the net export of oil from the US. This actually did more harm than good during 14/15 however. Although I would have thought that Obama supporters would hate the increased production of hydrocarbons
3143 2018-11-28 20:00:01 I agree. Where possible, diversifying energy sources away from another country’s nonrenewable oil/gas can be good for both national security & combat climate change. Increased blue seats in House & at state & local govts. may favor shifts toward greener fuel sources...

3146 2018-11-28 19:59:53 I think we have upset someone in the US. Don't want to build GM cars here after 100 years. Don't want our oil. Chinese will move in now.
3147 2018-11-28 19:59:39 Some people just can't abide being irrelevant
3148 2018-11-28 19:59:35 These so called experts should be smart enough to know that only thru innovation- driven by the energy industry, paid for by oil revenue- will solve climate issues. Not taxing the shit out of everyone and killing the global economy! Jeez even I figured that one out!!
3149 2018-11-28 19:59:33 I can’t een relate to it  like who pulling out da oil nowadays ?
3150 2018-11-28 19:59:30 Saudi Arabia is a responsible country, and it's cares about the international community's regarding the oil production and price.
3151 2018-11-28 19:59:17 Vaccines are epic
3152 2018-11-28 19:59:12 volatile oil prices will lead ultimately to government cuts from the underprivileged families
3153 2018-11-28 19:59:02 “I didn’t do anything to make my skin darker…TAN…” bitch a tan makes you darker. And she uses a tanning cream or oil or self tan…so it’s not natural

3158 2018-11-28 19:58:39 The best thing you can do is to call an early election. You have always been against the Alberta oil patch. You are not fooling anyone.
3159 2018-11-28 19:58:37 And in a round about way, he's more responsible for that than he is the oil production thing.
3160 2018-11-28 19:58:31 What about my 5 story apartment building on UES that was renovated just 3 years ago and is powered by FUEL OIL. Freaking FUEL OIL - in 2018??? It's not just big buildings.
3161 2018-11-28 19:58:26 Buttttttttt since your club started in 2008 by a corrupt oil money crook that loves to stomp the balls of foreign camel jockies and inflate commercial deals to buy the league i wouldnt expect you to understand what the rome and wembley events are.
3162 2018-11-28 19:58:22 That fool did everything he could to stymie and regulate the crap out of the coal and oil and gas industry. LIAR!!

3167 2018-11-28 19:58:10 in would come Iran and others seeking to take over the oil, drug trade and more. So in reality America can't leave. Too much money has been spent. We don't need another Iraq, remember what happened when Osama took the troops out. Chaos

3170 2018-11-28 19:58:02 that is exactly how climate science skeptics are treated...  They must be in the pocket of big oil, ....  Typical projection of their own flaws, In the pocket of big government or the UN
3171 2018-11-28 19:58:01 Unfortunately true but also standard oil and those behind it
3172 2018-11-28 19:57:59 Atmosphere FC for do something cos I don't like Oil FC
3173 2018-11-28 19:57:58 Saudi Arabia is a force for getting oil to the US.

•get to the Fire Temple in Zelda
3178 2018-11-28 19:57:10 This video has cognitive dissonance written all over it. You can’t be for green energy and oil at same time 
3179 2018-11-28 19:57:00 The video shows that your brain is really leaking oil.
3180 2018-11-28 19:56:58 Ann Collin. Or  sue Ellen as we like to call her oil tycoon
3181 2018-11-28 19:56:57 Natural honey is so fire lol.  I heard about oregano oil I’ll have to try it
3182 2018-11-28 19:56:52 Even if they weren't, are you alright with the dozens of companies that currently get subsidies and tax breaks (farm, oil, coal, and many others) who turn around and lobby for even more favorable laws?
3183 2018-11-28 19:56:47 That’s political bullshit originally spread by the PC party. The NEP didn’t crash oil prices, the Liberals have poured more resources into Alberta in 3 years than Harper did in 10. Being glued to partisan propaganda isn’t healthy for your brain.
3184 2018-11-28 19:56:46 Lobbyists paying greedy politicians it’s why GM and oil companies get tax dollars to make billions its truly despicable.
3185 2018-11-28 19:56:46 Also Saudi Arabia murders journalists (were largely responsible for 9/11). We can get by without their oil.  Trump Kowtowing for money isn’t a good thing for America
3186 2018-11-28 19:56:37 market ignoring that oil fail
3187 2018-11-28 19:56:29 I would like to see CBD oil made from industrial hemp.
The THC is in allowable limits plus they would get terpenes and other cannabinoids not found in distillates.

3188 2018-11-28 19:56:24 My BABY brother. Whom I held moments after he was born. IS 9 YEARS OLD. I'm not doing ok. Where do I sign up for the PTA? Trading in my car for a van. I need to start taking TUMS. How do I understand clothes and their stains? Do I put Vinegar and Coconut oil on everything now?
3189 2018-11-28 19:56:23 Powell gave oil a waiver
3190 2018-11-28 19:56:23 “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get  frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
3191 2018-11-28 19:56:20 We aren’t approving arms sales to continue the slaughter of innocent people in Yemen, hastening climate disaster by buying pipelines for oil companies, legislating away the rights of striking workers or cutting taxes on big corporations so we’ve had a less vile year than Trudeau.
3192 2018-11-28 19:56:14 @BorackObama  do you remember your own words "you didn't built that" well you really did not bring oil production to a new  you are and shall always be the President that killed companies
3193 2018-11-28 19:56:10 The snake oil salesmen won and have got away with it.
3194 2018-11-28 19:56:10 I'm a geek for an Edgar Cayce treatment.  The most intense arthritis treatment from his is top rub in castor oil (cold pressed) into your joints under a heat lamp. it's full of vit E and will restore cartilage and flexibility. Hope it helps, stay strong!

If it were the streets we would have to make them run that oil! #resist
3197 2018-11-28 19:55:47 Crude oil prices are around $50 a barrel & our US production is up so we have an excess. Supply is higher than the demand.

3199 2018-11-28 19:55:38 He suffered from severe eczema on his scalp and face. This client was completely bald in the middle and started using our oil in June 2x a day. He wasn't comfortable with taking pictures at the start of his journey but gained that confidence when he started to see results. 
3200 2018-11-28 19:55:38 I gotta chnage my oil this weekend and I’m not looking forward to that 
3201 2018-11-28 19:55:35 i was just about to be broke as hell after i paid my car insurance bill but apparently i owe $0.00 ?????? i seriously am crying like i wasn’t going to be able to pay for gas or an oil change but now i can because i don’t have to pay this month

3206 2018-11-28 19:55:09 Notely is losing support in BC, and most of us are in support of oil, and I'm guessing Ottawa is done to, I for one do not support her anymore
3207 2018-11-28 19:55:05 Kenya is been used by the colonial power the enemy the United States of America who is interested in the disputed territorial water for oil exploration. This is an illegal act in violation of international law and the consequences of such action will be paid in full. 2/3

3212 2018-11-28 19:54:42 Human activity's been turning rain forests into deserts for centuries, since Jesus is said to have walked the Earth. Long before the industrialised activity and 7 billion population we have to day. It's oil companies claiming they don't harm the environment, you believe that?
3213 2018-11-28 19:54:41 Just take castor oil you’ll be good in no time 
3214 2018-11-28 19:54:39 Always good brother!  Oil will be holding as Saudi Arabia and the U.S. cut production.  Stay tuned!  Gold will be over $2000 by the end of 2019.
3215 2018-11-28 19:54:38 We went to war in middle east to steal oil & most importantly the poppy fields that don't grow in America. We needed a lot so we could make all the opiates & get the population hooked on them while people make billions of dollars from it. We didn't go over there for reasons said.
3216 2018-11-28 19:54:31 There’s CCS and then there’s CCS+U. 

Also GHG’s don’t have to be used to make synth fuels. 

I guess it’s time to get off the fence. Why should Oil and Gas get all the funding for a problem they helped to make?
3217 2018-11-28 19:54:17 Obama??
3218 2018-11-28 19:54:16 So many factors at play with oil, that’s why it’s so fun (and difficult). And thanks ! I’ll push tone & Tyler to do TA on WTI haha
3219 2018-11-28 19:53:59 Pure olive oil is good
3220 2018-11-28 19:53:59 The pollution problem has been around for the referenced time span and that I'm all on board for reducing or eliminating.  Everyone on Global warming side wants to blame big oil but there are 1,000's of scientists who have signed a petition discrediting the extent &/or cause.
3221 2018-11-28 19:53:54 You forgot about the 8 years where 2 career oil men invaded the wrong country helped drive the price of oil from $20 to almost $150 and devastated the US  economy- took a full decade to almost recover from W/Cheney great recession
3222 2018-11-28 19:53:45 Tide water oil
3223 2018-11-28 19:53:45 What are their alternatives? If the oil companies ploughed their money into the development of clean energy transportation, these ‘clowns’ would have a different choice. Have you ever complained about roadworks whilst driving on the very roads created and maintained by them?
3224 2018-11-28 19:53:41 Stupid, Alberta never saved for a rainy day, always boom and bust but never learn, prices started tanking in 2014, yet now all in a panic, Alberta blames everyone but themselves and the oil industry, Trump and SA, convenient that Kenny takes no blame or Harper, adorable
3225 2018-11-28 19:53:40 Fuel is a similar price to here . Petrol more , diesel less or vice versa . This is due to the way Individual nations apply tax .Not exchange rate .Believe it or not EU members do have their own tax systems !With our tax system on fuel £1=$  fuel £1.70 L And the oil price is low
3226 2018-11-28 19:53:32 oh it's arthritis! use peanut oil or castor oil to rub in every day. glad you responded. def try the cbd it's legal anyway
3227 2018-11-28 19:53:31 My only essential oil is olive oil.
3228 2018-11-28 19:53:27 What's the b/e cost per barrel and WC requirement over the year? Also what CAPEX is required for further wells and infrastructure to sell the gas/oil?
No doubt sp will be much higher IF flow rates for Djeno are achieved as expected...
3229 2018-11-28 19:53:19 I didn't know about the motor oil thing but I already watched a video about faking food pics a while back and the thing that really fucks me up the most is still using white glue instead of milk

3231 2018-11-28 19:53:04 Only bc he wants to sell coal, oil & gas, it fills his pockets & if it does, that is what he believes. He's not fooling anyone! If  @realDonaldTrump  believes what he said, he is the dumbest man on the block! I believe one of his teachers said he was the dumbest kid in class.
3232 2018-11-28 19:53:03 @BenKallos I live on 1st Ave on UES in a building that was re-done just a few years ago, and shocked to find out that in this day in age it's powered by a big fuel oil tank in the back. In 2018. and the windows are a joke. please vote for the new law about building efficiency.
3233 2018-11-28 19:53:02 Yes and inflation to rise at same time? Scattergun economic analysis...Stagflation not seen since the oil shock of 73’. Need to learn some basic economics ...if anything such a lower £ will make UK exports more competitive. Do u not see that some of these indicators contradict?
3234 2018-11-28 19:52:50 Removing “subsidisation” for weightloss prescription, and imposing penalties for drs and surgeons etc that push starvation and organ amputation like snake oil and crack.

3237 2018-11-28 19:52:42 That new policy banning the requirement that these private corps pay for those damages was issued in July 2018. Issued to BLM also  in July 
           So, if they destroy huge parts of the Arctic Natl Wildlife Refuge, they walk away and leave it.

3238 2018-11-28 19:52:41 Well done @Outfoxthemarket. Not only do you fuck about changing direct debits to higher prices over winter...you complete it with a price rise from Jan 1st. Pathetic. That said I note how uncompetitive the energy market now is...oil down 30% though in recent months!
3239 2018-11-28 19:52:40 No cars no oil, Trudeau loves it, screw Canada.
3240 2018-11-28 19:52:35 Went to get ingredients for my Christmas and got items that do not use palm oil. Nestle not only uses palm oil but lied about it being sustainable! Read labels!
3241 2018-11-28 19:52:21 Another tough US #oil trading session: #Brent at $59.04/bbl (-1.94%), #WTI at $50.62/bbl (-1.82%), bears firmly in control despite #Saudi soundbites #OOTT #oilandgas
3242 2018-11-28 19:52:20 Motor oil never looked so good 
3243 2018-11-28 19:52:16 I will never understand why the American Business community keeps letting oil and gas companies profit by ignoring/denying climate change, when THEIR OWN BUSINESSES are going to be hurt- even devastated—by it.
3244 2018-11-28 19:52:09 This should be a gong show. A system that is already full adding more congestion. Look out farmers, could be a while to get your cheque’s if oil takes priority over grain. #whatacluster
3245 2018-11-28 19:52:07 they use motor oil in commercials instead of syrup
3246 2018-11-28 19:52:03 Genetic disposition is not necessarily a life sentence. Even it can be overcome with optimum diet, supplemental support along w/ other pain management techniques. CBD oil shows great promise w/o the danger of addiction.
3247 2018-11-28 19:51:50 Doug, with all due respect, fuck off. If you’re going to lie at least be somewhat creative. There’s this thing called google and all the facts on oil pricing are readily available. Enjoy your one term in office, if you last that long.
3248 2018-11-28 19:51:47 Well let's be honest...Saudi Arabia is a scumbag country, and there are only two reasons to even care about it: 1) Oil, 2) They're tight with Israel.  So no lie detected, really.
3249 2018-11-28 19:51:43 The evidence is a comprehensive report produced by 13 government agencies & over 300 scientists and researchers. 

You really believe they’re all in cahoots to show these dire results? To what end? There’s no money in it for them. 

If $$ was the goal, Big Oil pays better.
3250 2018-11-28 19:51:38 Breaking: #Flyers have also fired their locker room manager, team caterer, and the guy who changes the oil on the zamboni. 

Hakstol safe for now...
3251 2018-11-28 19:51:32 I just found this butter in my Momma bathroom that’s a combination of shea butter, coconut oil, papaya and vanilla extract and y’all.....
3252 2018-11-28 19:51:31 You still continue to lie to the "people". Taking credit for the switch to winter grade gas and the dropping global oil prices have zero to do with anything you and your environment killing party have done.
3253 2018-11-28 19:51:21 Wait till i get home
3254 2018-11-28 19:51:20 i hate oil!!!!!

3257 2018-11-28 19:51:06 Barack #Obama: “Suddenly, America is the largest oil producer . . . That was me, people . . . What are you complaining about? Just say, ‘thank you,’ please.”
To quote a popular phrase from a few years back, “You didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.” -@jimgeraghty
3258 2018-11-28 19:51:00 If u Live in an oil Town you sir should be aware of the indefinite rise & fall of oil. Oilfield family here  actually environmental side of the oilfield. Ups & downs u plan 4it. It nothing new

3260 2018-11-28 19:50:57 I like using coconut oil to take my makeup off but no one ever talks about how you have blurry vision for like 4 hours after
3261 2018-11-28 19:50:50 You praised Al Gore (who, you have to know, is a giant climate change hypocrite) today. You accused ppl who disagree with your new position on climate change as paid by oil companies. You conflate conservatism with the Republican party. It's not reality you are responding to.
3262 2018-11-28 19:50:50 The only oil Obama liked was the oil he used to grease up his manthing toy Michael!
3263 2018-11-28 19:50:44 The the spice er oil must flow!!
3264 2018-11-28 19:50:42 <学校を火の海にしてやろう！
3265 2018-11-28 19:50:39 So these Globalist paid hundreds of scientists to lie?, and they apparently have more wealth and power than the oil companies that are trying to stop climate reporting? And these rich oil executives are not globalist? Crazy conspiracy theories are going to get us all killed.
3266 2018-11-28 19:50:38 When will people understand that whacking a bit of argan oil from Poundland on your hair won’t make it grow have a trim hun x
3267 2018-11-28 19:50:38 yea I knew it was a scam but now how, this stuff crazy lol especially the oil on the pancakes
3268 2018-11-28 19:50:33 Trump likes money and oil instead of honor
3269 2018-11-28 19:50:28 Thx brother, must be the oregano oil 
3270 2018-11-28 19:50:21 Had they come out of freezer? Once defrosted, give skins a wipe to dry them off before rubbing with oil (I use olive) 200 degrees is about right though - maybe not in long enough?
3271 2018-11-28 19:50:18 how can you openly say you want to end oil, put that at the center of your presidency, and then claim responsibility for the oil boom. This guy is a total sociopath at best. The sad thing is all the retards who worship him actually believe this shit.
3272 2018-11-28 19:50:10 I got a free oil change too bitch I’m getting drunk tonight  it’s been a good ass day!
3273 2018-11-28 19:50:09 First, circular debt is always summed up by state institutes usually major part is from energy sector which is mostly run by oil. However, for sake of argument lets suppose even if its exaggerated figure, what it would be? half of it? still? 
3274 2018-11-28 19:50:08 You boys work at the oil refinery aint where im trynabe
3275 2018-11-28 19:50:03 No it wasn’t him. He did everything in his power to stop oil production on public land. It was President Trump who eased regulation.
O_____bama couldn’t stop oil production on private land. Just be honest folks.
3276 2018-11-28 19:50:03 I need a oil change
3277 2018-11-28 19:49:49 It might be good for your oil town if US oil companies were allowed to fix prices/production like OPEC countries do, but it’ll be bad for everyone else.
3278 2018-11-28 19:49:47 do u like natural shit? i can’t use anything w chemicals on my skin without breaking out so i stick to aquafor in the winter n castor oil n aloe vera gel n wash w papaya every few days
3279 2018-11-28 19:49:47 Natural gas does burn much cleaner than oil or coal though, it’s not ideal but a cleaner way to generate electricity whilst transitioning to renewables. Also methane, ethane, ethylene etc from NG can be used as chemical feedstocks to make all sorts of things.

3281 2018-11-28 19:49:33 (4/4) As Canada works towards a greener economy, people will actually be LOSING jobs in industries like coal/oil. Furthermore, many corporations that hire low-skilled employees are moving their production sites abroad where wages are lower. These jobs ≠ Canada's future
3282 2018-11-28 19:49:29 I smell like baby oil gel & Victoria Secret 
3283 2018-11-28 19:49:27 He fought every pipeline and oil exploration that came down in his 2 terms. So tell me again how it’s his achievement?
3284 2018-11-28 19:49:19 I reckon HE treated the floor with @CrushFoods oil, hence my slip
3285 2018-11-28 19:49:17 Precious equates to billions of barrels of Oil.
3286 2018-11-28 19:49:16 That’s why oil was laying rigs down when he was president
3287 2018-11-28 19:49:14 Wtf he had nothing to do w it.  He threw big oil under the bus.  Man is he delusional.

3291 2018-11-28 19:48:53 The senate must vote to destroy all of Saudi’s oil capabilities! That would stop them!
3292 2018-11-28 19:48:36 Thanks for replying Maryanne. Yeah I have oil pastels, but the issue of sealing them holds me back. I want to use them on canvas, not under glass.
3293 2018-11-28 19:48:31 Truthfully, I'm not impressed with what you guys call rehabilitation. I though the whole of 111 road will be interlocked from Forte Oil to Milieu  haven school. How can a portion be interlocked and just before ur rehabilitated road there's a pothole. What kinda work is that?
3294 2018-11-28 19:48:22 Don’t call me mummy please, mechanic, engine oil drinkers sympathizer x
3295 2018-11-28 19:48:16 @RachelNotley It is so ironic and satisfying that Fed's desire to carbon tax and green us to death at expense of our economy, now results in more carbon/emissions by your new trains. This is what they get for ignoring our energy infrastructure. Good on you! Move that oil!
3296 2018-11-28 19:48:14 I bought hair mist but do I really need it?I can mix water and oil oh
3297 2018-11-28 19:48:09 Too bad you won't be around to explain how mankind went extinct from ignorant and deliberate destruction of habitat. You can't eat bibles, oil or gold.
3298 2018-11-28 19:48:07 Oil and gas companies are the most subsidized areas of the corporate world in the country
3299 2018-11-28 19:48:07 All he did was try and sell oil in his own currency and the Americans stormed in and killed him, not like he killed anyone Isit
3300 2018-11-28 19:48:04 U.S. oil benchmark slides toward $50 as crude settles sharply lower
3301 2018-11-28 19:47:54 He just can’t go away can he?  He was so anti oil and coal.  He’s a narcissistic liar!
3302 2018-11-28 19:47:53 What a self centered piece of work. What policies did you put in place to encourage oil production and oil use? Prove me wrong. I will apologize.
3303 2018-11-28 19:47:53 Mama ooo ambassador of kings oil 
3304 2018-11-28 19:47:52 Scientists think some, but not all, of the coming damage is preventable.

And we're not talking minute differences even then.

And why does working on this have to blow up the economy? Big oil may whine but they're not the whole economy.
3305 2018-11-28 19:47:50 You can't understand how the whole engine works from understanding what oil does, but if you're trying to understand what the engine does, noticing that certain aspects slide/lubricate via this one substance is pretty useful
3306 2018-11-28 19:47:46 That Abacha looted our oil money is no longer news. The question is how did he loot it if not through Buhari the then PTF chairman. 

You now understand why Buhari can give up his liver in defending Abacha's "lootocracy".
3307 2018-11-28 19:47:41 Maybe black ink would have been a better choice-- ya know -- from oil supplied by our close friends from Saudi Arabia?
3308 2018-11-28 19:47:32 fair enough, Notley is definitely up against the wall. I suspect if buying a train to ship oil had a viable business case, the oil companies would be all over it.
3309 2018-11-28 19:47:23 I might be a oil field kid but, I ain’t oil field trash I can promise you that..
3310 2018-11-28 19:47:22 So I get to the dealership, the 1 I talked to booked me for yesterday. I said Wed. This whole is it covered bit is stressful. I've had my 2015 for 3 years as of Mon. There's excess oil on part of the motor. I just can't afford a repair if its not covered plus the diagnostic
3311 2018-11-28 19:47:16 Who got the cheap oil changes ?
3312 2018-11-28 19:47:16 i’m embarrassed to get my oil changed bc they’re gonna see how long ago i was suppose to get it done
3313 2018-11-28 19:47:15 I love when you get an oil change and they show you the dip stick, I'm like "ahhh, yep that's oil"

3316 2018-11-28 19:47:01 i came for a fucking oil changed not for other shit  gimme my damn car back
3317 2018-11-28 19:46:56 Are you kidding me. Obama put more restrictions in place then any other president that caused jobs to leave and more imports that put oil companies here in the U.S out of the Competition
3318 2018-11-28 19:46:43 oil down nearly 2% is an extraordinary red flag but everyone knows what's going on. Fed sugar rush. How long does it last?
3319 2018-11-28 19:46:42 @Edwin_Honoret if you want those curls poppin we need hair masks on hair masks boi! do oil treatments a few times a week and use it as a prewash b4 u shower, hair masks once a week and leave it on as long as you canhope that helps
3320 2018-11-28 19:46:30 What is your plan to address all the issues America is facing because of these companies that pollute our lands, air and water? You are a slave to Big Oil And Gas! The most patriotic thing a Congressional member could do is to support a clean America! #GOPisOnTheWrongTrack 
3321 2018-11-28 19:46:26 US gov for many administrations has sucked up to Saudi Arabia.  For oil?  Balance against Iran?  Whatever reasons / excuses there are, humanity demands it come to a stop.
3322 2018-11-28 19:46:22 Just went to store and purchased 10 bottles of baby oil for a kid art project. Got a few strange looks.

3324 2018-11-28 19:46:18 Wait...Climate Change and oil....Obama is actually proud of this? Now I’m really confused.
3325 2018-11-28 19:46:17 @cvpayne Still waiting for someone to blame Obama for the GM problem...It was during his administration that he pushed for the Bolt, a car that no one wanted in the first place. Obama for 8 yrs opposed drilling for oil & supported instead electric, wind & solar...a failed policy.

3335 2018-11-28 19:45:27 This is my reply to Secretary/General Mattis with regards to the Trump WH stand on MBS: "What the f**k is wrong with you people??, we dont need Saudi Arabia. They finance Wahabist terrorism. like ISIL. Most of the 911 terrorists were from SA. We dont need their oil.
3336 2018-11-28 19:45:18 remember when speedwagon made his riches as an oil baron bc he could smell the oil in the ground
3337 2018-11-28 19:45:18 Remember when the Venezualians visited Pawnee in Parks and Recs? They were super rich jerks with all the oil money in the world. Amazing to see what Socialism can do in just a few short years
3338 2018-11-28 19:45:08 Don't mention the oil that's due tae run out..... again.

3341 2018-11-28 19:45:04 I love the peppermint oil. You might look into the stress relief line from bath and body works, i use the mint eucalyptus pillow spray and it helps a lot if I’m trying to go to sleep with one. Or maybe a wax melter and peppermint melts?
3342 2018-11-28 19:45:03 If the oil market sells off again, the Canadian Economy will go into freefall, the banks who lent to energy companies will see systemic losses, and the who complex is taken to the cleaners before xmas as liquidity simply disappears. 
The bottom is 5-20 days away thinks some folks
3343 2018-11-28 19:45:00 They are and they do. This isn't regulatory issue. If there was an alleged conspiracy to drive drown the oil price and drive out competition that would be an anti-trust issue for the Competition Bureau to address.
3344 2018-11-28 19:44:56 CBD oil is a ploy by big marijuana to normalize weed in our culture and get tight ass conservatives to loosen up and legalize it in the US. Its a big waste of money

Anyone remember initial China offer on soybeans, oil and nat gas what volumes they would “commit” to?   #OOTT
3348 2018-11-28 19:44:34 Oil companies using private mercenaries to steal land from indigenous peoples. Cities where the CEO of a major corporation has more political power than any elected official. Private capital interests dictating the nation's foreign policy interest. This is feudalism, buddy.
3349 2018-11-28 19:44:30 putin has oil money
3350 2018-11-28 19:44:24 You implied states were of equal significance. They aren’t. Most of our oil is imported anyway. We’d be far better off looking for alternate fuel sources.
3351 2018-11-28 19:44:19 Non dairy whip subsititute is just creepy. If it’s not dairy then what is it? Oil, sugar, and chemicals. Ick
3352 2018-11-28 19:44:18 It certainly did not decimate fracking or gas in Colorado or anywhere north of here.   We did become a major exporter under Obama which did drive oil down.  Which in turn made oil exploration and extraction too expensive.  Coal is done.  It needs to be put to bed.

If im lucky maybe i can afford more than just chicken and oil
3355 2018-11-28 19:43:57 This was in spite of his policies which hindered oil production in the U.S. What a charlatan!

3357 2018-11-28 19:43:47 With some experience you'll get used to handling chemicals, then your skin won't get hurt. :)
You can try applying some oil in the hand, then wear gloves, 
Oil and acidic chemicals don't dissolve and created different layers. Then your skin will not get affected at all. :D
3358 2018-11-28 19:43:46 New 52-week low for WTI crude oil $50.09

3362 2018-11-28 19:43:31 @RachelNotley Congratulations for standing up for Alberta and Canada and our most valuable resource! Move that oil! Fed's deserve this: Now oil is being moved by more expensive and dangerous methods. Fed's deserve this.
3363 2018-11-28 19:43:25 Nothing more pathetic than someone which clearly doesn’t understand the oil sector making such ill informed comments. Stick to banning plastic straws
3364 2018-11-28 19:43:10 are you for or against the hedgehogs ???? Or are you just FOR oil ???
3365 2018-11-28 19:43:08 Man my radiator was finna go out this guy talking about it’s fine just need more oil ..... it went out the next day
3366 2018-11-28 19:43:01 Hey fam, I finally figured it out.  Oil has an 18 month lag to the York Region housing market.  April 2017 the decline started in York Region, in October 2018 it started in oil
3367 2018-11-28 19:42:59 We know after our oil outlet that you will abandon me and kill us and give us to Iran. We are not stupid and ready to interfere with America and others. We have bought enough weapons to cut you like what happened in Afghanistan.
3368 2018-11-28 19:42:57 I love cooking sweet potato.

Just.
Cut in half. Rub garlic oil over. Salt. Pepper. Shove in oven and bake.

Eat with spoon . Perfection
3369 2018-11-28 19:42:56 @WashTimes Can't believe President Obama is out telling he is responsible for our oil and gas development and now abundance.  He and dems ALL made fun of those promoting "drill baby drill".  They tried their best to stop development, force wind and solar, and kill coal industry.
3370 2018-11-28 19:42:50 LMAO!!!  Shameless fuck. Fought the oil/gas industry at every turn.
3371 2018-11-28 19:42:49 @Edwin_Honoret if you’re really about that hair treatment you need to do coconut oil hair masks and get the it’s a 10 leave in conditioner. it will heal your hair and help those curly boys thrive.
3372 2018-11-28 19:42:39 We do not know what tax revenues would be due to us from companies registered in England e.g. all the supermarkets.

There would be no tax rebates for oil companies like Shell.
Our tax system would be overhauled and simplified.
We could vote to bring in land reform.
3373 2018-11-28 19:42:36 Crude oil futures for January continue their downward trend Wednesday afternoon. $WTI_Crude -1.28% at $50.90 & $NBZ_F -1.99% at $59.01 $USO -2.47% at $10.68,on 11/28/2018.
3374 2018-11-28 19:42:30 I hope he at least dress that sandwich up with some lettuce (ice berg lettuce b/c romaine out here killing people), tomatoes, olive oil mayo, and a dab of mustard. That would be a fye ass bologna sandwich. Hope she got 2 sandwiches. Can't be fucking for just 1 bologna sandwich.
3375 2018-11-28 19:42:18 Well, in a perverse way, he could be somewhat right...the same way that he became America's #1 gun salesman. I'd say he hated and fought guns and oil similarly!

MAY DAY EN LA CAMPIÑA THERE ARE PROBLEMS
3377 2018-11-28 19:42:11 We need to gain market share while we still need oil. Shut down Venezuela/Iran/Saudi/Russia if you want to make a difference on the supply side.
3378 2018-11-28 19:42:10 Oil sucks
3379 2018-11-28 19:42:08 Oil says NO.
3380 2018-11-28 19:42:08 Bitches.... maintaining rather than cutting oil production targets doesn’t mean that actual oil production won’t be cut. Because of the oil waiver miscalc. OPEC+ have been producing in excess of their 2016 agreed production framework
3381 2018-11-28 19:42:07 The man who implemented more Federal Regulations in history is taking credit for increasing oil production. This is hilarious. He must think the whole country is as ill informed as his sycophants.
3382 2018-11-28 19:41:56 I’m finna get an oil change and ima let them know don’t ask me bout shit else! 
3383 2018-11-28 19:41:51 Sure. Then replace "shill" with "anyone paid by a corporation/industry with a strong financial interest in the bad-faith obfuscation of the core of the debate at hand."
In this case, anything with direct ties to fossil fuel profits. Gas, oil, coal, frackers, combustion engines...
3384 2018-11-28 19:41:46 Hehe, what is your end goal exactly? You did it, Saudi Barbaria! No more weapons for you and f your oil! Let those clowns save face and in return, have more influence on certain things.
3385 2018-11-28 19:41:41 all of u are fools! u are back tracking after blaming the forest service on the fires instead of global warming.  Bet ur pals in big oil love that since they helped by u the oval! Ur not a hero so stop acting like it
3386 2018-11-28 19:41:40 As a consumer living paycheck to paycheck I really just can’t bring sympathy for the rich oil baron who has to foreclose or sell one of his supranumary summer homes just to “make ends meet”. They may be too low for the Baron but they sure as hell cant get too low for me.
3387 2018-11-28 19:41:32 Are you still putting palm oil in your chocolate? I'd love this post if not 
3388 2018-11-28 19:41:30 There are natural birth control options, use neem oil while you’re having sex. Don’t put poison in your body please
3389 2018-11-28 19:41:26 ISDIN (Fusion Water/Oil Control) maravilloso 
3390 2018-11-28 19:41:25 Go shut down Venezuela, Iran, Russia, or Saudi first, NOT our ethically produced oil.
3391 2018-11-28 19:41:21 My daddy really make having a car fucking hard!!!! Luke why are you not answering the phone you knew I was getting an oil change today WTF
3392 2018-11-28 19:41:18 Rosemary and olive oil triscuits with chive and onion cream cheese. 
3393 2018-11-28 19:41:16 не, кажется я буду на выходных пересматривать /опять/
3394 2018-11-28 19:41:15 @jimcramer Oil is falling that might bring us down again?
3395 2018-11-28 19:41:15 That’s happened to me. I mentioned an oil change and like adds for valvoline came up
3396 2018-11-28 19:41:15 Guess oil didn’t get the Powell memo
3397 2018-11-28 19:41:08 Indeed always playing the Tory party line. Found those secret oil fields yet?
3398 2018-11-28 19:40:52 In 5 days either the Oil market responds to Trump/Xi (USA/China) Tariffs by having a truce and the demand for trade returns and we get a bounce. Or we have a continued decline, a sell-off of combined tax loss selling and genuine lack of market demand that takes no prisoners.
3399 2018-11-28 19:40:51 thai soups are also excellent for killing germs. when you can see that chile oil floating on top, that’s how you know it’s gonna be good.
3400 2018-11-28 19:40:48 Pathetic. Take up oil painting or something that will help you to sleep at night.
3401 2018-11-28 19:40:47 Who knows a good place in Denton to get their oil changed ? I usually get it done in my hometown but I need one now lol
3402 2018-11-28 19:40:44 わらいしぬ
3403 2018-11-28 19:40:39 If I'm not mistaken, Ammonium Nitrate (AN) is a chemical fertilizer, but it is also sometimes combined with fuel oil (FO), usually diesel I think, to make a crude but powerful explosive called ANFO
3404 2018-11-28 19:40:37 AB said that the "Eastern Bastards can freeze" - us eastern bastards will not forget that. Especially since our province relies on Oil & is also affected by low prices. But you don't hear us whining & bitching & feeling entitled - AB does nothing but!!
3405 2018-11-28 19:40:32 I’ve used both and heat usually works better for me. The peppermint oil is by far the best but doesn’t last as long as I’d like.
3406 2018-11-28 19:40:31 I hate bringing my car for an oil change because it’s never just an oil change 
3407 2018-11-28 19:40:28 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
3408 2018-11-28 19:40:28 You the reason niggas always talking about us not having oil changes 
3409 2018-11-28 19:40:19 Amla oil wow!! Reminding me of my boarding schools days in KZN. 
3410 2018-11-28 19:40:18 Turkey and spinach on wheat.
Juicy, thick cuts of turkey with crunchy folds of green leafy goodness.
With olive oil mayo.
3411 2018-11-28 19:40:12 Some call Carney a pessimist, some call him an optimist ,I call him an experienced optimist.
3412 2018-11-28 19:40:11 Oil as lube ;)
3413 2018-11-28 19:40:08 Annual imports of around $600 billion so a market worth tapping. Also the financial centre of Europe. Notable exports would be mineral fuels, oil, metals, spacecraft and weapons.
3414 2018-11-28 19:40:08 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
3415 2018-11-28 19:40:08 Another breakdown in OIL
3416 2018-11-28 19:40:06 Mayor of Tijuana don’t want em there either because they ain’t spending any money to watch the donkey show. 
3417 2018-11-28 19:40:03 What a lying crapbag. All oil growth was on private and state land because Obama admin suppressed production where they could.
3418 2018-11-28 19:40:01 Cold weather is not for black people. I literally put on COCONUT OIL on my feet and like an hour later I look like a goddamn Neanderthal trekking through the Walmart parking lot, scavaging for provisions in these blistering winds and ungodly cold temps.
3419 2018-11-28 19:39:48 Same Obama that creates jobs for wind and solar energy, which basically all died out. 
Same oil reserves that America has been sitting on for past 30+ years

3420 2018-11-28 19:39:43 .@SecPompeo: “The #Houthis claimed last week [Nov. 19] that they’ll cease these attacks. But will they also stop trying to blow up Saudi oil tankers with drone boats laden with explosives, which could target #U.S. ships sailing through the strait.”
3421 2018-11-28 19:39:39 Any mechanics on here? The oil light in my car came on and I need to know ASAP if I need olive or vegetable
3422 2018-11-28 19:39:33 Obama ruined GM with deal to make all electric cars.  Because he said oil and gas not coming back.  GM followed his false lead.  He shut down the pipe lines making us dependent on rogue nations. He tried to ruin our Nation in every way.
3423 2018-11-28 19:39:33 Without oil we cannot produce enough food to support the worlds population
3424 2018-11-28 19:39:19 My car is so special it only takes synthetic oil... yay me.
3425 2018-11-28 19:39:12 Man since that  tweet about tricks commercials do with food. I look at commercials different just seen the Burger King commerical about their pancakes. Me: So you just going to pour car oil on pancakes sitting under cardboard smh?!?? The nerve I’m hip to youll. Lol
3426 2018-11-28 19:39:10 Y’all need to calm your tits about Palm Oil and look at the bigger picture. 

Tell me when you’ve managed a full shop without any of your products containing it. 
3427 2018-11-28 19:39:06 Se oil der uma folga
3428 2018-11-28 19:39:03 Buy a jar of coconut oil this winter
3429 2018-11-28 19:39:02 it looks like they drizzle motor oil on the fries and cheese
3430 2018-11-28 19:39:01 She's not stopping the pipeline you idiot federal government combined with Anti-pipeline groups backed by American Oil companies are.
3431 2018-11-28 19:39:01 How can they chuck rocks at border patrol and expect anything but an ass whoopin?!
3432 2018-11-28 19:38:57 So many people leaving Hempworx to come to CTFO!! I just found out you have to pay 2 shipping fees for oil!
3433 2018-11-28 19:38:57 Also I had two great chats with two nice old ladies while getting my oil changed today, they both liked my boots and loved talking about having cell phones now
3434 2018-11-28 19:38:55 Imagine if Canada owned the oil sands and didn't need to subsidize them, or have royalty peanuts thrown at us while threats of job loss forced govt to give in to unfair demands that harm Canada.

Publicly we would get all the royalties and subsidies would be investing in Canada.
3435 2018-11-28 19:38:54 No you don’t you like oil whisky water and gas and bases to keep your trident. Goodbye.
3436 2018-11-28 19:38:48 Oh, please try to build that wall on the Texas border. Denying humans, livestock and crops access to water. We would love to deny the rest of the country oil and fuel. The open market looks good. Don’t tread on us!!!
3437 2018-11-28 19:38:46 How much does his snake oil cost?
More than Al Gore’s?
3438 2018-11-28 19:38:46 Come change my fucking oil then
3439 2018-11-28 19:38:42 A calloused economy bleeding oil and and industry.
3440 2018-11-28 19:38:35 Our feet are often neglected but they deserve Healthy treat. My Feet #SecretSpaTherapy is making Mix of equal quantities of oatmeal,corn meal,sea salt,olive oil,aloe vera with peppermint oil then apply to feet & massage. @SanghviBharati @SanghviRuchika

3441 2018-11-28 19:38:34 do we know if edwin uses coconut oil
3442 2018-11-28 19:38:33 let's hope there is a law against physically blocking railways I wouldn't put it past opponents to Alberta oil
3443 2018-11-28 19:38:28 Oil falls 2.5% to 2018 low, settling at $50.29, on rising US stockpiles and OPEC uncertainty -- CNBC
3444 2018-11-28 19:38:24 what's the rationale for the supplements to start? some ppl have reactions to the fish oil because, even w high  quality, the histamine levels of it can be aggravating when they start. berberine is derived from plant compounds which defeats the point of going without plants.
3445 2018-11-28 19:38:18 Can’t believe America literally destroyed the world over some dirty ass fuckin oil
3446 2018-11-28 19:38:10 No, it's a site created by working Albertans who are worried about changes that are transforming the world's oil and gas economy -- and what those changes mean for jobs and the economy in Alberta. We want ALL parties to pay attention and prepare. So far, only the NDP has done so.
3447 2018-11-28 19:38:08 Do we truly need oil from the Saudi's? Their money from weapons sales? DO WE? Will our nation wither & die? Will our country's financial stability deconstruct without their money? Does our nation depend on them for its very survival? I think not.
3448 2018-11-28 19:38:06 @Edwin_Honoret asking for a hair routine like we haven’t been telling him to get it popping with the black castor oil deep conditioner each week
3449 2018-11-28 19:38:04 Doug Ford is so smart that he managed to engineer a crash in crude oil prices on the world markets.
3450 2018-11-28 19:38:02 Great afternoon at the annual #ApeAlliance Symposium! Kicked off with the wonderful @4apes and followed by many inspiring speakers. A good message of buying into sustainable palm oil rather than boycotting it taken onboard by many
3451 2018-11-28 19:38:02 All for that paper green rectangle with no official backing other than perception and (now) oil manipulation. We never truly learn, do we? Hopefully its not too late now though and we can beat them w/out war!
3452 2018-11-28 19:37:59 Notley goes to Ottawa for a big speech on her response to the oil price differential crisis. But Kenney responds with his own proposal.
3453 2018-11-28 19:37:47 Came to get an oil change first I parked in the wrong spot second I was trying to move my car and couldn’t get out cause there were so many cars around me I literally just kept backing out and pulling back in thirdly I couldn’t figure out which door to walk in I’m done.
3454 2018-11-28 19:37:43 My oil change was just $20 cause he liked me 
3455 2018-11-28 19:37:38 you should start using motor oil on pancakes
3456 2018-11-28 19:37:37 And yet everyone on this thread who are so concerned about climate change are abusing everything made from oil. How concerning is that?
3457 2018-11-28 19:37:37 found the perfect person to start my locs . she uses nothing but all natural products & only oil to retwist 
3458 2018-11-28 19:37:33 Just throw chicken and some kind of veggies on a cookie sheet sprinkle olive oil and seasoning on it and bake till chicken is done. Line the baking sheet with foil and you have the easiest clean up

3461 2018-11-28 19:37:29 hey, what magic shop is this that sells pants, oil paint and robot dogs?
3462 2018-11-28 19:37:27 Coconut oil, castor oil, shea butter, raw eggs, etc etc etc. What's your hair type?
3463 2018-11-28 19:37:09 @Edwin_Honoret organic coconut oil works sooo goood for your hair but you have to leave it on for hours. if you can, sleep with it and then wake up and just apply conditioner.
3464 2018-11-28 19:37:09 well truthfully bush w. started tho process of increasing oil production domestically and obama continued this and trump greatly accelerated it with deregulation so obama has some credit and bush too but more credit goes to Trump IMO for the OIL
3465 2018-11-28 19:37:04 @ittbitiijackii got her nigga cleaning her car and changing her oil and shit. Meanwhile I can’t even get a nigga to buy me a snickers bar  I’m finna stop fuckin with black niggas y’all ain’t coo  Jackie! Where can get a man like yours ?! They on sale somewhere ?! 
3466 2018-11-28 19:37:02 Ахах, жизнь какая
3467 2018-11-28 19:37:01 Haha, he fought the oil and gas folks for years.  Now his is responsible for the growth?  Sorry Obama, bit to use your words "you didn't build that.".
3468 2018-11-28 19:37:01 OIL bounced off $50 again but down 1.8%.  Fun times watching the greatest ping pong market.  $XLE, on the other hand, up 1.17%.  Stay in equities, ladies.  The Fed will protect you from harm.
3469 2018-11-28 19:36:52 The con artist in the White House want us to take the eye out of the crystal ball now you see it now you don't he's a snake oil salesman is good when it. help you It's bad when it harm you he is a man that grow up without love
3470 2018-11-28 19:36:51 Oil the most manipulated commodity that ever existed
3471 2018-11-28 19:36:50 Wow, I am so glad Obama has educated me, claiming he is responsible for today's oil and gas growth.  

Gee, what took so long?
3472 2018-11-28 19:36:49 NDP is obviously desperate for oil royalty. I thought the Pipeline was sure thing. Obvious question is what value do rail tankers have if a pipeline is eventually built. Other question is when these cars actually start to haul oil.
3473 2018-11-28 19:36:31 You should by a guitar and learn to play :) Im planning to learn oil painting 
3474 2018-11-28 19:36:24 @Edwin_Honoret put coconut oil in your hair, it's the best treatment
3475 2018-11-28 19:36:02 Dried powdered bay leaves in the window or peppermint oil
3476 2018-11-28 19:35:51 Bachelor's life in not really good ooo

EPP A Soul
3477 2018-11-28 19:35:48  just don't eat it all in one sitting  the orange oil is a laxative  #aFriendToldMeHonest
3478 2018-11-28 19:35:47 If you're going to go off on an unhinged rant, you should at least understand what you're ranting about. Natural resources belong to the province; AB has reaped hundreds of billions from AB oil. Federal government gets increased corporate tax, land sales, indirect taxes.
3479 2018-11-28 19:35:47 oh just yer typical 60 cent bounce on #OIL in under 5 mins..

no biggie #OOTT
3480 2018-11-28 19:35:46 @Edwin_Honoret use castor oil to grow out ur hair and “fresh” rose water for skin it works wonders trust me 
3481 2018-11-28 19:35:39 whitepill of the day:
when we hit peak oil and theres no more electricity, things like dishwashers, laundry machines, dryers, electric and gas stoves, will all be useless and femoids will be too busy to sell pictures of their buttholes
3482 2018-11-28 19:35:38 Because you know the future?
495,000 illegal aliens apprehended. 
1.5 million legal immigrants.
Who knows how many weren't caught?
Prob close to 2 million per yr come over all categories.
A very high number of ppl to provide jobs, housing, infrastructure.
3483 2018-11-28 19:35:33 Crude oil futures just hit $50.06 but I'm sure everything is fine $CL_F
3484 2018-11-28 19:35:33 getting dis oil changed ugh
3485 2018-11-28 19:35:33 I'm using Rosita's Cod Liver oil for overall health and skin!
3486 2018-11-28 19:35:29 You're very correct. That's why I'm not going to use Cover Girl until I have researched this to make sure they're not using #PalmOil alot of companies call themselves #crueltyfree but still sneak in Palm oil.
3487 2018-11-28 19:35:29 Barack Obama 2012:   "We can't just drill our way to lower gas prices."
Barack Obama 2018:  Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was me people ... say thank you."

#ThisGuy
3488 2018-11-28 19:35:23 #Oil stopped at 50 again. It may be an attractive price for buyers.
3489 2018-11-28 19:35:17 Pretty much anything you'd cook in a pan with vegetable oil will taste better if you use ghee instead.
3490 2018-11-28 19:35:14 That's probably motor oil. 
3491 2018-11-28 19:35:08 PEI government energy efficiency programs have reduced CO2 emissions by 33,000 tonnes and saved more than 11 million liters of home heating oil to date. Energy efficiency is now easier than ever.
3492 2018-11-28 19:35:06 So the power company shut off the power to my house because the transformer outside is leaking oil...I won't have power for an hour now.
3493 2018-11-28 19:35:03 Not a patriot. He is a snake oil salesman. He had an opportunity to visit troops in a combat zone and serve them Thanksgiving dinner, like W did. So disrespectful to our boys in danger...
3494 2018-11-28 19:35:02 well good thing i drowned my hair in argan oil last night
3495 2018-11-28 19:35:02 @BarackObama When it comes to oil you are a drain plug, doofus.
3496 2018-11-28 19:35:02 What unbelievable hacks. The science is only settled since Trump was elected? You supported with gusto Bush and Romney whose positions on climate were identical. Bush was THE oil man. Now you’re throwing stone? Utterly shameless.
3497 2018-11-28 19:35:02 That with granita and dill oil? Absolutely superb.
3498 2018-11-28 19:35:00 O: *does everything he can to shut down oil and gas extraction by closing down more public land exploration than any other president*
Gas industry: *bypasses by using private land*
O: LOOK AT MY ACCOMPLISHMENT!
3499 2018-11-28 19:34:59 Made the mistake of going over to her page ('fucks like a champion' apparently). Phew, whats going on there? Its like reliving my 70s drunken, pot induced, socialist 'discussions' with commies and Che Guevaraists again. Made no sense then and none now. Can smell the Patchouli oil
3500 2018-11-28 19:34:48 @TunnockOfficial stop putting palm oil in my favourite biscuits, #notmyfavsanymore
3501 2018-11-28 19:34:39 ~half of open interest on $45 puts traded today. #oil
3502 2018-11-28 19:34:38 Yup. One would think with all the tech we have, someone could come up with a better, safer mode of transportation. But it won't happen because oil money is big money and they run the shit show.
3503 2018-11-28 19:34:38 But that's the thing with countries that have natural resources with high value, especially oil. They're reactive, it should be expected that any drastic change should result to violence. Maybe revolution needs careful planning to ensure win-win in all scenarios to be possible
3504 2018-11-28 19:34:35 No view on oil. Just observing.
3505 2018-11-28 19:34:31 Stop ripping off chronic pain patients like me. I have multi level back issues like stenosis, impinged nerve roots and more. You guys are scam artists. PEDAL YOUR SNAKE OIL ELSEWHERE before I sic the FDA and FTC on you con men.
3506 2018-11-28 19:34:28 if ur gonna do either soak ur hair in conditioner or coconut oil first it helps protect ur hair
3507 2018-11-28 19:34:27 @TunnockOfficial stop using palm oil #SaveTheOrangutan we love your biscuits but will stop buying them ‘cause with love the Orangutans more
3508 2018-11-28 19:34:25 Denial of facts is not “the other side” it’s just wrong. The right has occupied more than enough attention to their unscientific arguments b/c they get paid by oil & gas industry to deny facts.
3509 2018-11-28 19:34:18 Oil making that move!
3510 2018-11-28 19:34:15 Is it just my skin or whenever I put tea tree oil on my break outs they leave dark spots?
3511 2018-11-28 19:34:12 Not Oil industry, real estate, Brexit, USMCA and trade wars, it seems #metoo is the real reason behind troubles with Canadian economy. It seems Directors are complaining of behavioural issues in powerful positions that are causing our economy to slow down.
3512 2018-11-28 19:34:09 and give him a pay raise while at it. Unlimited funds. Unlimited scope. Unlimited time. 401k for life. Dig until u hit oil, gold or just plain mud. Good grief
3513 2018-11-28 19:34:08 Has Obama gone totally brain dead. Does he not know that there are Video recordings of him saying under his system fuel cost would necessarily double. He was the no oil , no gas burning engines green energy man. Now he’s responsible for the US being number one in oil. Please
3514 2018-11-28 19:34:01 July 23, 2018. Please Read.

3515 2018-11-28 19:34:00 I just googled oil pulling. Wtf is trying to swish coconut oil around in their mouth for 20 whole minutes? That’s a long time
3516 2018-11-28 19:33:58 already getting my car an oil change

3518 2018-11-28 19:33:51 Oil is a fossil fuel and is becoming a fossil.  Green energies are what a lot of us would like to see more of.  Instead touting a dying industry, why dont you try and promote clean energy?  Whoever comes up with a good energy plan will be a hero in my books!
3519 2018-11-28 19:33:44 To be honest, I’ve had mine repaired 3 times! It was close to £500 too. What you’ve got is a good idea. With the fresh yeast, use 1tsp with same for sugar, wth 100ml warm water. Mix & leave till frothing. Add to flour & 200 ml more water  with salt & oil. 10 min with dough hook
3520 2018-11-28 19:33:40 Okay so no late lunch for me. I haven't eaten at McDonald's in several years. Grew up loving their french fries then they changed oil and inside became unkept. Nasty
You know when a teenager won't eat there its home and make PBJ sandwich
3521 2018-11-28 19:33:37 Obama is a liar trying to steal the credit for our success in oil pproduction
3522 2018-11-28 19:33:32 I need a oil change
3523 2018-11-28 19:33:25 "Oil Tot" all these sexy "Cute Teddy Bear" like selfies is driving my hormones crazy! Your looking awesome as always "Oil Tot". Keep charming the pants off of anyone who has a #socialmedia account!
3524 2018-11-28 19:33:16 Oh I'm sure we will see improvement, I have this snake oil I have been rubbing on my wallet.
3525 2018-11-28 19:33:00 My truest test has come: can I fit all the clothes I brought, plus 2 bottles of olive oil, one jar of honey, several boxes of spices, two Tupperware of cookies from my mother, my down jacket my dad brought, and a box of baklava into the one suitcase I brought with me?
3526 2018-11-28 19:32:53 His Oil & Gas buddies are in panic mode over what’s happening in the automotive industry. 5 years ago the industry was predicting EV would never exceed 1% then 3% and now its looking more like 90%.
3527 2018-11-28 19:32:38 Hey @SajeWellness do you have a recycling program for your essential oil roll one?

3530 2018-11-28 19:32:36 #OIL back near the lows and #NATGAS near highs.

3532 2018-11-28 19:32:07 Now even Mattis is starting to leak oil on his credibility #MSNBC
3533 2018-11-28 19:32:04 Justin’s plan was to phase out oil sands. Of course he wouldn’t participate in this. But thanks for tanking our 4.5 billion asshole!!!
3534 2018-11-28 19:32:04 Suddenly he’s a clinical psychologist. And an oil drilling god. Someone put him on a throne! #please
3535 2018-11-28 19:32:03 I guess he forgot about the $20 per barrel produced in the US oil tax he proposed...
3536 2018-11-28 19:32:01 @RachelNotley @jkenney Another Lac Mégantic waiting to happen. NO oil by train!
3537 2018-11-28 19:31:50 I’m always positive about #LFC but this game is a little too much. Oil money is designed to buy a squad of world class players. Think we’ll be too short, but prove me wrong  #allezallezallez
3538 2018-11-28 19:31:35 Contrasting policies:
Notley: buy rail cars (and ask Ottawa to contribute to cost)
Kenney: cut oil production
3539 2018-11-28 19:31:23 I do not see Big Oil  giving up their lucrative business and the politicians that are tied into the whole issue .... you know what I mean on that
3540 2018-11-28 19:31:22 As long as government is subsidizing them the technology is never going to improve and find a market. Make a great clean power source that's better and cheaper than oil and people will buy it. No government involvement needed.
3541 2018-11-28 19:31:18 is that why oil just puked
3542 2018-11-28 19:31:13 Here's one for the Climate Change Globalist. Stop driving at Gas Guzzling SUV. Stop Jet Setting. Demand the use of ethanol be banned. Demand the use of Wind mills be band. Ever look at at the base of a wind will. Oil and dead Birds and Bats all over the place.
3543 2018-11-28 19:31:13 Bless you. I was going to make an Oil of Ulay reference but remembered that would date me tremendously.
3544 2018-11-28 19:31:10 yes, so my question rephrased: why aren't oil companies buying up their own rail tanker fleet? When you're in say, $500B deep in mines and upgraders, isn't buying yourself a $350M train on the table? Hell, the province can buy one, and the oil industry several more.
3545 2018-11-28 19:31:09 Oil still weak despite equity bounce
3546 2018-11-28 19:31:02 when they pull this is attempt to slam credit and smalls as they did last year, or whenever oil was in the 40s - its all a blur anymore

3549 2018-11-28 19:30:43 you already stated why, kenny. they're poorly educated. they fall for the snake oil salesman because they don't have the capacity to spot a liar or know they're being taken advantage of. in short, they're not very bright.
3550 2018-11-28 19:30:42 Hang on, 100% of the worlds palm is for oil and 98% of their income from oil, PKE is bassically irrelevent, seems you want to use one arguement for one sector, and ignor it for another
3551 2018-11-28 19:30:35 That made me think that there will be less oil changes also.....
3552 2018-11-28 19:30:32 Correct, but probably in small print it will say that all appt must be attended! A new car has a warranty, unless you never change the oil!
3553 2018-11-28 19:30:30 3rd official day on cbd oil. Let’s go
3554 2018-11-28 19:30:26 Nothing much. How far have you gone with the oil and gas shit we were discussing the other day?
3555 2018-11-28 19:30:26 Egotistical liar.  He did everything to stop fossil fuel production. Everything he did was wind & solar. Put oil and coal out oif business was his message. He's nothing more than a two bit liar trying to steal Trump's thunder.

3558 2018-11-28 19:30:22 It’s the Alternate Fuels that he spent half a trillion on that is driving down Oil prices..... HAHAHA

3562 2018-11-28 19:30:16 she also let off @NicolaSturgoen 

she should have questioned her on the currency union and the oil revenue forecasts and the set up costs
3563 2018-11-28 19:30:16 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
3564 2018-11-28 19:30:13 Bullshit!!!  My son works in the industry.  During Obama my son had to work in the middle east to take care of my grand children.  Now he works at home.  Obama was against the oil industry because of the global warming fools.
3565 2018-11-28 19:30:10 By not sheer coincidence at all, the Bible lists "people that destroy the Earth" in the group headed to hell after the return of Christ. So if there's any truth to Chem trails, or if the things like the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are any indicators to Whom it speaks.. ...
3566 2018-11-28 19:30:09 Does the CBD oil affect the gaba receptors?
3567 2018-11-28 19:30:08 What? I thought he was the climate change guy. He’s have an identity crisis. It happened despite of him. Happened on private land. He came into office during the shale oil boom. Govt. owned land is another story.
3568 2018-11-28 19:30:08 Why wasn't oil and gasoline mentioned in the list? Or even coal? Those are viable alternatives...
3569 2018-11-28 19:29:56 Well that escalated quickly. #Oil dump into close
3570 2018-11-28 19:29:49 $SPY oil is crashing again...but $xle is ramping up..

3574 2018-11-28 19:29:31 Keep smelling patchouli when I get in my car and turns out there’s a cracked bottle of patchouli essential oil in the handle of my car door just chillin.
3575 2018-11-28 19:29:31 Are they made vegan or are they cooked in non-vegan environments (like shared oil or such)
3576 2018-11-28 19:29:30 Just keep stuffing that oil money in your pockets. That's all that matters, right? Every clown has his price and I can see right through your big red nose.
3577 2018-11-28 19:29:17 Oil slick.
3578 2018-11-28 19:29:14 William had salted Carmel ice cream, and we had sweetened white onions and real potatoes fried in Vegetable Oil and Butter.
3579 2018-11-28 19:29:05 Oh you’re right, I guess I can tel you since it’s a holiday....walnut oil, MCT oil & ground flax
3580 2018-11-28 19:29:01 It’s not just the Saudis! Most of the oil burned in the East and BC is American refined and basicly Canadian oil? So we pay for postage both ways plus refining and have been for ever?
3581 2018-11-28 19:28:58 Shutting down oil production in the Gulf doesn’t make you the #1 oil producer in the world.
3582 2018-11-28 19:28:41 In all fairness, horse and buggy does less polluting (and horse droppings make good compost/fertilizer for crops) than a car does-- am also including the use of oil/gasoline in modern automobiles as a pollution factor.
3583 2018-11-28 19:28:41 Option E: pour more oil on the rest of you work shirt to blend in
3584 2018-11-28 19:28:32 I thought I was the only one who sees the squirting oil in KFC chicken
3585 2018-11-28 19:28:30 Desperate to create a legacy...oil and gas production increases is not one of them. He fought pipelines...demonized fracking...and restricted drilling. Technology breakthroughs and the courage of the private sector won the day...thankfully
3586 2018-11-28 19:28:29 Does shea butter baby oil count? That’s what I use lol
3587 2018-11-28 19:28:20 The economy and the steel industry....and the coal industry....and oil drilling.....are not bedrocks of the American economy. They’re outdated, outmoded industries. Focus on things that really matter - education and upward trending industries. You’re terrible a businessman btw..
3588 2018-11-28 19:28:17 I bet he's no oil painting himself, probably in real life he could be mistaken for Quasimodo's long lost brother.
3589 2018-11-28 19:28:08 Oil prices crash and ban on fossil fuels loss of fishing will make Scotland poorer
3590 2018-11-28 19:28:06 y’all should be very proud of me rn, I’m finally getting an oil change
3591 2018-11-28 19:28:05 ｱｰﾛﾝﾍﾞｰﾛ！！！ﾀﾞｰﾈｯﾄﾌﾟﾘｷｬﾚ！！！ﾔｰﾔﾔﾔｰﾔｰ！！！ﾁｪﾝｼﾞｮｶﾆﾁｮﾝﾁｪ!ｶﾘｶﾘﾄｩ!ｶﾒﾗｱﾝｸﾞﾙ!ﾁｮﾑﾆﾀﾞﾁｪﾝｼﾞ!!!!!!!!
3592 2018-11-28 19:28:00 OIL HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH
3593 2018-11-28 19:28:00 The best thing to do is bring the price of oil down further. This requires Saudi help. We could lean on them over the Khashoggi killing. Low oil hurts Iran and Russia. Win win situation.
3594 2018-11-28 19:27:55 Cruel irony is that because the Texas heavy oil refineries were set up for Venezuelan heavy, and that country has entirely collapsed, they are actually offering above WTI price per barrel. We should be milking the US for every red cent of that, but we can't get product to Texas.
3595 2018-11-28 19:27:27 Lol am sorry but i don't equally know.
3596 2018-11-28 19:27:22 Hi Damien, they are pretty soft, not as buttery as R and F. They are basically paint in a stick. You might be better with oil pastels?
3597 2018-11-28 19:27:22 True story...sort of. Oil exploration on private lands Obama had no control over is the reason. Gotta love a guy who fails at everything he does, blames his failures on everyone else, and then takes credit for everything he had nothing to do with.
3598 2018-11-28 19:27:18 Stopped drilling in the gulf, blocked the pipeline and now he is taking credit. That was Trump eliminating regulations which created jobs not only in oil but in coal also.
3599 2018-11-28 19:27:14 The pain I can deal with (just), but I really don't like the blind spots and weird zigzag/colours thing. It's like having a Pink Floyd gig behind your eyeballs! Thanks for the peppermint oil tip, though - I'll definitely give it a go.
3600 2018-11-28 19:27:11 @Thom_Hartmann Dem Platform: 1. money out of politics, end lobbying, everyone votes 2. end oil subsidies, rigorous environmental plan 3.universal healthcare for all 4. tax overhaul 5.withdraw troops, audit the Pentagon, revise immigration, oversight on ICE/Border Patrol.
3601 2018-11-28 19:26:59 peak oil och peak oil. jag vet inte. vi använder knappast mindre av det fossila, förnybart är en obetydlig del av det hela.
3602 2018-11-28 19:26:55 Bolton has always been in big oil’s pocket.
3603 2018-11-28 19:26:53 Hey, Barry - on the booming stock market & oil production, YOU DIDNT BUILD THAT! If Barry's lips are moving, he's lying! Most disgusting, corrupt, inept President ever! Obama killed biz by foisting job killing regulations on them, and regulated oil production to a trickle.
3604 2018-11-28 19:26:53 I don’t know anything about loans, I do know he harshly regulated fracking on federal land, halted multiple pipeline plans, and froze offshore drilling in many areas of coastline... Some might say that’s not going to help the oil industry “boom” lol.
3605 2018-11-28 19:26:45 行きてぇ...。私も当然ながら全巻所有しております。３枚目は先生の事務所再現ですかね。SANKYOゴルゴの｢海へ向かうエバ｣はスナイプした後に｢じゃあな、エバ｣を言うんで｢わかってねぇな開発！｣となったものです。
3606 2018-11-28 19:26:44 @HowieCarrShow isn't outraged by the hundreds of thousands of innocent Muslims that America slaughtered in its oil wars. Also, not upset by the thousands of innocent killed by drones. Not upset that the president conspired w/ an enemy nation to attack our democracy. He loves him.
3607 2018-11-28 19:26:34 If he was coming straight out of being the OC at UCF, then I would consider it.  He clearly prefers being in the NFL though and that is typically oil and water.
3608 2018-11-28 19:26:33 Don't you think that is a question for someone who wants to be Premier?? You are giving @jkenney a free ride by not questioning his blind faith in the future of fossil fuels in Alberta. HE. HAS. NO. PLAN. That's what terrifies me. It's oil or nothing. #ableg
3609 2018-11-28 19:26:31 Fracking grew tremendously during the Obama years.  I don’t know what role he played directly but the USA did become a far greater producer of gas and oil during the Obama years.
3610 2018-11-28 19:26:14 Responsible? You realize we know that is completely and utterly untrue, don't you? Until it is completely foolproof and you can prove that any accidents can be 100% cleaned up w/o an affect on the natural environment, there's no such thing as responsible oil development.
3611 2018-11-28 19:26:13 Oily Skin

Those with oily skin experience quite a bit of shine, and very often struggle with acne breakouts. Excessive oil can result in larger pores, and you may find that your makeup “slides” of during the day without reapplication.
3612 2018-11-28 19:26:06 St long oil scalp #cl_f
3613 2018-11-28 19:26:02 conspiring to launder corporate money into political donations. Jack Abramoff scandal, taking "contributions" from Russian Oil then denying his vote was taintered, K street project, misuse of federal resources, Cuban cigars scandal, being a large a$$hole
3614 2018-11-28 19:25:52 だれか窒息させてくれないとねれない
3615 2018-11-28 19:25:51 My mom gave me this oil that’s supposed to make my hip feel better and it really does work bro  what does hip pain feel like? I wouldn’t know!!!!
3616 2018-11-28 19:25:39 Drunk Again but I think Hebert Island is the only logical choice "Red-tailed duck wrapped in tinfoil, Catfish fryin' in peanut oil!" A total winner!
3617 2018-11-28 19:25:37 America it is President Donald Trump and his Administration that made America the greatest oil producer in the World.  America it is President Donald Trump and his Administration that is right now at this very minute #MAGA.
3618 2018-11-28 19:25:36 So nice to have an Obama and Hillary voter on here.  Do you really think the *say thank you* part is of real relevance here.  His taking credit for oil production is what this thread is about.  But keep on defending your kind, snowflake.
3619 2018-11-28 19:25:36 Thanks Big Oil. For putting Alaskans to work, one politician at a time.
3620 2018-11-28 19:25:31 I am almost certain that I dobt that Canadians want @CPC_HQ who are pro oil and corporations in power in ottawa. Pipelines do not befit canada as a whole and only favor Alberta. Really lame how Notley is trying to play the victim to win sympathy. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
3621 2018-11-28 19:25:26 I'm sure animals don't like woodsmoke. I know of two cats who got asthma from it and "our" two carrion crows never sit on wood burners' chimneys. They have got a favourite one - people have oil central heating.
3622 2018-11-28 19:25:19 The problem is that alberta is selling its oil at a discounted price due to the Canadian infrastructure unable to support the current output. A pipeline would help alleviate this issue. WTI $51, Canadian crude selling at $21 40% loss to Canadians
3623 2018-11-28 19:25:13 I have to get my car inspected and oil changed next month ugh girls and gays, keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I mentally prepare myself for that
3624 2018-11-28 19:25:12 Railroads and oil were cornerstones of the Industrial Revolution.  Throwing money at solar has mostly given us Solyndras.
3625 2018-11-28 19:25:12 Let's debate the repercussions of having our energy sector dominated by electricity instead of keeping diversity with oil and gas. Let's face it, there's no such thing as "clean energy " , using less is a must! But when demand for power goes up, will the price be affordable?
3626 2018-11-28 19:25:11 His incompetence was exceeded only by his arrogance. Good riddance to bad rubbish!
3627 2018-11-28 19:25:08 ... and sadly it will be, don't overestimate power of oil $$$$s, there's no way around it
3628 2018-11-28 19:25:07 Oil oil oil! Let’s try something else too while we still are able to
3629 2018-11-28 19:25:05 Rubbing clove oil on a hurry tooth works wonders! Hope sausage is feeling better 
3630 2018-11-28 19:25:04 Oil and gas companies love renewable wind and solar energy because it means more natural gas plants have to be built to back them up. They love hydrogen, too - just make sure you get it from natural gas. They hate nuclear - no backup gas plants necessary. #Moneytalks
3631 2018-11-28 19:25:03 It is happening now though in Yemen. Saudi's being handled with gloves because of their oil wealth while thousands of children die... We will never be equal it seems.
3632 2018-11-28 19:24:59 You did nothing to promote anything positive for America!! Stocks, oil, etc was not made better from anything you did!! Trump has worked hard to undo your lies and destruction.
3633 2018-11-28 19:24:57 He did everything he could to some growth in te oil industry. When he left office Trump reversed his policies and the oil industry is now in boom times.
3634 2018-11-28 19:24:55 And I bet all these environmentalists live on welfare and food stamps provided by the Feds who have collecting billions from Alberta oil, Quebec Pulp mills.   How ironic / I say stop protesting Canada’s wealth & resources - start appreciating it, promote pipelines & get a job!!

3638 2018-11-28 19:24:32 hi yes!! the rose quartz is just like an additive for additional healing. the rose water controls excess oils & refreshes, the lavender oil is anti-inflammatory & reduces stress, while the jojoba oil is moisturizing & doesn’t feel greasy! 
3639 2018-11-28 19:24:30 Approval means Jack. People used to believe that oil was worthless until they realized what it can be used for. People believed that the earth was flat and the sun revolved around it.
3640 2018-11-28 19:24:27 I just made the most amazing pancakes I’ve ever made, true say mi never have no motor oil or cardboard, so mi never take no picture
3641 2018-11-28 19:24:27 @jack @TwitterSupport why do you keep giving blue tickets to criminally dishonest people like the environmental terrorist above?  There's nothing this corporate oil shill can bring to the conversation, please demote him!
3642 2018-11-28 19:24:19 2.  Food prices may even drop, and there is room for some inflation. Oil and many commodities are not necessarily tied to EU. So , to be fair is possibly a half truth.  N.B note all the usage of  words like ‘could’ ....’may’....If.  In nearly all PROJECT FEAR stories.
3643 2018-11-28 19:24:14 Oil dump into 2:30 close - again $USO
3644 2018-11-28 19:24:13 Ja men där håller jag med. Dessutom är det ju så att den fossila ekonomin förlorar lönsamhet snabbt - mkt snabbt - vid en viss punkt i produktionen som närmar sig raskt, den s.k peak oil.
Nu finns det ju kol, naturgas och massa annan skit men de har samma problem.

No other country in the world has been as punitive to their energy industry as Canada, but unfortunately the shrapnel from this economic destruction is hitting everyone. #wealthdestruction
3650 2018-11-28 19:23:44 Yes! That SOB blocked everything the oil industry tried to do when he was in office. He’s still and always will be a lying mf!
3651 2018-11-28 19:23:42 He says that all while refusing to discuss why they shut the CIA up and won’t even let the CIA director talk to the senators about their assessment. Pompeo is a good old corporate boy, and he’s going to protect the oil deal. We know better.

3654 2018-11-28 19:23:27 America you always need to remember this it was President Donald Trump that signed the Executive Order to start and finish the Dakota and Keystone Pipelines using American Steal to put it together to get oil flowing to make America more energy independent.
3655 2018-11-28 19:23:15 @Paul_engytrd Get ready.. This oil is looking beyond sick.. Anyone foolish enough to pay up for this gets smacked down straight away.
3656 2018-11-28 19:23:12 We suffer not for lack but for not being aware of what we have as an inheritance in CHRIST to breakthrough.

3664 2018-11-28 19:22:36 Great read.  Lots of information. However, I see today, for example, most Canadian oil stocks are down on a very up day.  What you think of that?

3670 2018-11-28 19:22:11 We threw money at the budding oil industries, and the railroads were incredibly subsidized enterprises in the mid 19th century.
3671 2018-11-28 19:22:03 Hi Claire. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
3672 2018-11-28 19:22:00 @rushlimbaugh reminds us that u cannot have an electric car that doesn’t need coal, oil, r natural gas 2 charge the batteries! So ur not really fighting climate chg w these cars! I guess Obama forgot 2 mention this!

Try putting essent. oils in unscented lotions or grape seed oil to act as an antimicrobial.
3674 2018-11-28 19:21:40 But it's crude oil and needs to be refined to power our dreams
3675 2018-11-28 19:21:39 More electric cars, means less gasoline, which means less electricity needed to refine crude oil into gasoline. It also means that the demand curve for electricity can be flattened out

3678 2018-11-28 19:21:17 No, I’m not a sufferer - I just feel concerned about folks who are. A colleague of mine used to swear by peppermint oil on the temples, but I’m sure it’s hard to manage some stuff without pharmaceuticals, and even then...
3679 2018-11-28 19:21:15 We quite literally did become the largest oil producer under Obama. Try doing your research.
3680 2018-11-28 19:21:11 it's globalists blocking oil, not Canadians, and globalists include ndp and liberals. Canadians that have a brain from NFLD to BC want our oil, not Sauds.

3683 2018-11-28 19:21:04 @jkenney  not opposed to increasing oil by rail but argues it's not enough, soon enough. Says mandated production cuts a bigger impact, sooner.
3684 2018-11-28 19:21:01 WHO??? Name ONE person, ONE SCIENTIST, other than those in the cotton, paper, and oil industries, who have gotten rich from climate change. 

Go on...

I’m waiting...
3685 2018-11-28 19:20:58 The global markets are what killed the oil prices. Others over-producing, not us under-producing.

So how does Alberta producing more oil shore up the low prices and help our economy?

If it is viable, why is the government paying for it instead of the corps working the sands?
3686 2018-11-28 19:20:56 Environmentalists are hypocrites - protest everything/like the comforts of everything. Oil not ethical, coal  dirty, nuclear affects climate change,  but I love to live in a warm house. & drive my SUV (like D. Suzuki).  Beef produces Methane! - freeze and starve  for all I care!

3688 2018-11-28 19:20:27 Strong message at the Sequeira Partners oil&gas symposium came from Iggy Domagalski when he suggested “anti oil and gas activists “acting” as environmentalists are only harming the planet by moving safely regulated Canadian projects to less responsible regions of our planet.”
3689 2018-11-28 19:20:27 Oil price is around 60$ Brent crude.second thing Govt revised oil prices monthly basis by one regulatory authority recommendations and third PM ordered more suits for stitching don’t worry

3691 2018-11-28 19:20:24 my thinking is that w oil prices in free fall, companies (that can) would be switching to crude instead of NG. which would lower demand for NG. but its not? inventories super low w colder than normal weather on the horizon? idk just my thoughts. guess we find out tomorrow

3696 2018-11-28 19:20:14 The survey I took said it was Donald Trump that wanted to drill for oil in Alaska and deep out in the Ocean.  America it was Obama that signed a Executive Order not to start the Dakota and Keystone Pipelines.
3697 2018-11-28 19:20:11 So your a naked caveman I guess, we will always need oil. Sorry but it is the truth.
3698 2018-11-28 19:20:08 Natural things will be your best friend! Anything lavender scented. If you get a diffuser and put lavender essential oil into and have it on in your room before you go to sleep it could work wonders.

3706 2018-11-28 19:19:09 Yes, oil production increased during the first part of Obama’s presidency then plummeted during the last two years, wiping out almost all gains. The decline reversed course after Trump’s inauguration, has overcome all previous losses and has risen to an all time high.

3709 2018-11-28 19:19:05 I think what you mean to say, is, others with my view don't have enough money to do anything about the matter. Govt isnt supposed to favor industry in detriment to people. Drilling for oil vs implementing cleaner infrastructure wont help gas prices in years to come. What gives?
3710 2018-11-28 19:19:01 Apparently the average IPP cost also includes the IPP gas peakers? 

How does profit “plunge” by 89% from R6.3bn to R671m?

IPP costs are up 29% due to “high volumes” - meaning high demand for peakers or high supply by RE? 

Is cost of oil (diesel) a factor? 

Too many questions
3711 2018-11-28 19:19:01 It’s quoted accurately. And he’s telling Americans to thank him for ObamaCare, oil production, and the stock market.

3724 2018-11-28 19:18:02 Oh come on, you suppressed oil drilling because of "global warming fears".  Trump is the one who opened it up.

3726 2018-11-28 19:17:53 Oh absolutely. I made chicken breasts tenders and ooooo it is MOIST. And yes, they do fry without oil but you can add a tad of coconut oil or essence/taste/aroma. If there isn’t breading, it would come out like pan fried which is how it is when you fry something without breading
3727 2018-11-28 19:17:52 That would be foolish when Canada’s oil reserves are third only to Venezuela & Saudi Arabia we are the largest single import of oil to the United States until the World no longer needs it why would you allow other countries to produce it & have to buy from them.
3728 2018-11-28 19:17:49 Oil production is dependant on the auto industry which is aggressively transitioning to EV’s. GM’s announcement this week should have been an additional wake up call. This money would be better spent on retraining and paying tuition for a new education for those in the oil field
3729 2018-11-28 19:17:40 Been taking the oil for 3 weeks. It def helps me sleep solid through the night. Also helping with chronic inflammation and anxiety. It’s no joke. Dosing can be weird til you figure out what works for you!

3737 2018-11-28 19:17:09 You almost sound surprised. Have you not been paying attention to what's been happening in Alberta. Every day businesses are closing cuz libs & NDP shut down our oil. Now that it's happening in Ontario it's a tragedy? Buckle up it's a bumpy ride.
3738 2018-11-28 19:17:05 You’re failing to consider the contributing factors that led to this. That’s all I’m saying. None of this is black and white, there is a lot of nuance that you’re failing to acknowledge, and yet to paint liberals with that brush. Pot meet kettle. Ps. No one said oil is bad

3740 2018-11-28 19:17:01 Yeah, Obama produced more oil for the United States of America.  I agree with that.  I remember Deep Water Horizon and precisely how he determined to handle that disaster.
3741 2018-11-28 19:16:46 If it is that’s down to the conditions set by NEB right. You can’t argue the set up was always ok for a x7 increase in traffic. But if the conditions have been met, then yes, I don’t see oil by rail affecting much other than rail associated risks.

3750 2018-11-28 19:15:43 Did anyone get held accountable for the use of COREXIT solvent for the spill? It's every bit as damaging as the oil... possibly worse
3751 2018-11-28 19:15:39 Jojoba Oil.
3752 2018-11-28 19:15:36 ya girl finally got an oil change #adult
3753 2018-11-28 19:15:32 @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo -- Sec. Pompeo is lying to cover for the Crown Prince -- Trump Administration wants to keep close ties with the Saudis (despite them killing Khashoggi and are involved in a proxy war against the people of Yemen) because it wants Saudi money, oil ...
3754 2018-11-28 19:15:25 The market isn’t moving towards clean energy and if you think that’s the case then your kidding yourself. Would you rather us produce our own oil or import it from global markets?
3755 2018-11-28 19:15:22 In gemert i have what done there i put a banana into the exhaust from  my overneigbour car and they know not till today who that have done.and i give them up for a programm loose weight 250 kg where she.. and oil from my car i did like it from them they clean it lol real Bart S
3756 2018-11-28 19:15:19 When OIL is cheap there's no reason for Electric cars.
3757 2018-11-28 19:15:12 Okay, he just made a jackass of himself here. He's not the one who the okayed the Alaskan oil pipe. He's not the one who opened the coal mines for business. He's not the one who permitted companies to begin oil production from American lands. What a fraud.
3758 2018-11-28 19:15:09 do this:  Big Tax breaks on every one of the 3 million bbls/day we EXPORT to the USA and steep tariff on every one of the 1 million bbls/day we IMPORT to eastern Canada --> this is Incentives the EE pipe + incentive to upgrade oil in E. Canada
3759 2018-11-28 19:15:03 because high Oil price not because of any New Industries created by PDP
3760 2018-11-28 19:14:54 ปวดทำไมตอนนี้ = =
3761 2018-11-28 19:14:53 Funny he never did this when oil tanked in 2014/15,
3762 2018-11-28 19:14:49 Yes - there's some orange oil or similar coming through as the dram breathes - yummy!
#GlenMoray
3763 2018-11-28 19:14:47 Sure, but animal protein is a better source. Also, animal fat is better because it's low in polyunsaturated fat. 

Stay away from vegetable oils, like corn and soy oil. Those are super inflammatory. Olive oil and coconut oil are much better.
3764 2018-11-28 19:14:46 And people cheer this revisionist. The stock market didn’t take off until Trump took office because big business realized there was no longer an anti-business President. Oil production increased due to reg reduction and same reason. This guy is hopeless.
3765 2018-11-28 19:14:44 Me: I'm going to start eating healthier! *makes fancy potato and onion sandwich with olive oil*
Also me: *literally eats an entire fucking pizza for breakfast*

I now need deep voice oil & height oil. I'm sick & tired of my little brother looking like my big bro.
3768 2018-11-28 19:14:42 What is virgin coconut oil? Is it like over the clothes humping virgin or maybe a little touching virgin?
3769 2018-11-28 19:14:38 For some reason I believe it’s all the Oil Wildcatters that are business’ and not the government @oil_and_gas
3770 2018-11-28 19:14:34 I’m so scared to put ANYTHING other than soap and baby oil lol I’m learning like you
3771 2018-11-28 19:14:32 purchasing a travel sized cuticle oil is one of the best decisions ive made in 2018

3774 2018-11-28 19:14:24 Oil talks
3775 2018-11-28 19:14:23 Par contre huile de foie de morue et yaourt grec au miel. Sur amazon cod liver oil au citron. Ça marche.
3776 2018-11-28 19:14:13 I love berries and cream with tissue oil it mks my skin glow
3777 2018-11-28 19:14:13 I actually cry at everything always and nathan doesn’t bat an eyelid but as soon as I cry about him THROWING boiling hot oil at me he goes “ no need to cry about it” 
3778 2018-11-28 19:14:12 February: Notley bans BC wine and threatens to shut off taps, out-Kenneying Kenney.

November: Kenney demands industry-wide oil production limits, out-NDPing Notley.
3779 2018-11-28 19:14:08 This is just the beginning.  You’ve never ate their Shawarma which they use palm oil instead of bama?
3780 2018-11-28 19:14:05 You didn’t hear?! I cured (insert disease here) by dipping this essential oil into my fries! If you want to be on my team we need (insert characteristic here) like you to help us sell!
3781 2018-11-28 19:14:03 Y’all watch one video on Facebook about making food pretty for commercials and now everyone wants to talk about motor oil
3782 2018-11-28 19:14:02 Shill Motor Oil
3783 2018-11-28 19:13:43 How so national security?   We have the oil for years to come.
3784 2018-11-28 19:13:39 For me the weirdest part of this is that a heavy majority of the Democrats’ white progressive base sees rising oil production as a *bad* thing. It’s just future carbon emissions being extracted from the ground to them. So who’s he trying to impress here?
3785 2018-11-28 19:13:35 Here’s what the Dems want to happen. Use forceful response to Saudi then oil prices go up and then gas prices go up then they will come out and blame Trump for the high gas prices. All a big con game by the Dems
3786 2018-11-28 19:13:31 Ladies check a man’s kitchen. If he doesn’t have olive oil in there there is a 100% chance he skips class to play Call of Duty and has a second Snapchat that you don’t know about.
3787 2018-11-28 19:13:26 We, the USA, screwed up Central America, the government of Venezuela screwed up the country! Just another democratically elected autocrat clinging to power. We don’t need their oil which is part of the problem! #VelshiRuhle #MSNBC
3788 2018-11-28 19:13:25 America I know this for a fact because about 1 or 2 years ago  I took a survey on this very subject and it specifically stated that Obama was the one that would not do any oil exploration in Alaska or either in the ocean.  So America Obama is a big fat lair.
3789 2018-11-28 19:13:24 i hate talking to someone that works in the oil fields because you can talk to them for like 5 minutes NONSTOP but then there are times where you won’t hear from them ALLDAY
3790 2018-11-28 19:13:21 @RachelNotley ‘s response is a subsidy to multinational oil companies. Didn’t work with GM. If Albertans want to subsidize bitumen producers go ahead however keep your grubby hands out of the rest of Canada’s pockets. Diversify your economy.
3791 2018-11-28 19:13:19 Wilson stop licking the olbas oil off of my shirt >:c
3792 2018-11-28 19:13:18 Mais où va-t-il trouver toute cette électricité si tout le monde s’y mets..Cela  va faire un gros Plouf dans qq temps - nous avons connu toutes les périodes, Après le charbon, EDF avec des bons remboursables puis le gaz oil et maintenant tout électrique avec des centrales 
3793 2018-11-28 19:13:15 Study it all you want. Electric cars are the future. Give the Saudi Arabi prince another BJ and ask for lower oil prices again, it wont matter. You cant stop evolution. You are being an oil pig. Oil spills and smog are killing Americans. Wake up, others have, entire world has.

3795 2018-11-28 19:13:08 My last dog had seizures all the time and it’s the worst to watch. I would try cbd oil or cbd dog treats twice a day and see if that helps at all. Usually the side effects of seizure medication for dogs are worse than the actual seizures
3796 2018-11-28 19:12:59 Sadly we can’t have it, as it’s in the future. And actually even afterwards, in 10 years we’ll never really know whether we’d have been better off staying - because there’ll be war in Ukraine, or vast oil reserves discovered, or global warming gets better, or something.
3797 2018-11-28 19:12:55 Need to get my oil changed keep bs
3798 2018-11-28 19:12:43 Try cooking oil, bar of laundry soap, matemba etc. . .season appropriate!
3799 2018-11-28 19:12:37 Liar, liar, pants on fire.  He and his people shut down federal oil and gas leasing, both onshore and on the OCS, mortally wounded the coal industry, and illegally cancelled an oil and gas lease issued by Reagan in 1982.
3800 2018-11-28 19:12:36 "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OIL PRICES?"
"MOOOOOOOO"
3801 2018-11-28 19:12:35 Sorry Oshitstain you had nothing to do with it. All that production came about because privately held oil leases were being drilled. Narcissistic shitbag.
3802 2018-11-28 19:12:32 bruh that motor oil with a bunch of cardboard.
3803 2018-11-28 19:12:28 Cauliflower, Coconut oil, Ginger, Turmeric Stew – Amazing!
3804 2018-11-28 19:12:09 when oil hits 45 or lower buy big
3805 2018-11-28 19:12:08 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3806 2018-11-28 19:12:01 Sounds like project fear has come out again, and no doubt the amount of oil left in Scottish waters will plummet
3807 2018-11-28 19:11:59 Shea butter treatment oil
3808 2018-11-28 19:11:53 So, Kenney is asking for curtailment of oil production so that oil and gas prices go back up to prevent job losses, despite oil companies still making massive profits.
3809 2018-11-28 19:11:52 i used to think fish oil was discosting now i drink it all day and put it in my dr pepper
3810 2018-11-28 19:11:50 Hit and miss on that - almond milk actually uses quite a lot of water to process and land to process. Much like palm oil, the product is fine, the production is terrible.
3811 2018-11-28 19:11:49 What’s a good face oil?
3812 2018-11-28 19:11:46 Iceland have no products with palm oil 
3813 2018-11-28 19:11:36 Snake oil... 50% off sale
3814 2018-11-28 19:11:36 I only use olive oil on my skin so that’s all for me; I do my nails for special occasions, otherwise it’s clear polish. I don’t think I have ever had lash extensions done so there is that. Only thing I really spend money on consistently is threading eyebrows and waxing.
3815 2018-11-28 19:11:22 Not sure if it's pathetic or disturbing (possibly a bit of both) but I have no doubt Obama believes he's responsible for America being the largest oil producer, for it's now booming economy and for all of President Trump's accomplishments.
3816 2018-11-28 19:11:20 @BarackObama Takes credit for #oil boom? After years of stalling #NorthDakota! Also talked credit for green conference- GREEN OIL- ok - the man is a MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGLOMANIAC
3817 2018-11-28 19:11:19 @BarackObama go home you just fabricate and pontificate about this great Obama era worst years of my life.  @realDonaldTrump you did not make us greatest oil producer you gave billions to Iran and shut mines down.
3818 2018-11-28 19:11:15 The oil industry expanded despite of Obama not because of it. All the expansion happened on private land while it reduced 10-20% on federal land due to his regulations.
3819 2018-11-28 19:11:06 I was in the oil field when had no clue a left us alone. Money flowed in because of the ror and he cared less. He woke up and found are petrochemical exports way up and thought he was great. A liar is all is
3820 2018-11-28 19:10:57 People right now on Twitter are scrambling to find a set up shot of a pancakes to comment that it's motor oil
3821 2018-11-28 19:10:57 Oil of Ulay
3822 2018-11-28 19:10:56 Caster Oil..old fashioned natural castor oil..it's will make your natural texture shine relax and it makes the hair jump out of your head....
3823 2018-11-28 19:10:49 i could really use some motor oil on waffles rn ugh
3824 2018-11-28 19:10:49 I thought democrats were against oil and stood in the way of more exploration?
3825 2018-11-28 19:10:48 Why is oil the only energy you talk about?
We have the chance to lead in green energies which will create jobs outside the oil sands and will not need the environmental clean up the oil sands produces
Diversifying energy will help Canada
3826 2018-11-28 19:10:42 Shea butter oil , that caster shit too thick & I don’t like the smell lol
3827 2018-11-28 19:10:34 Also why do opec everytime , sponsor high oil prices for us shale, they are getting high oil prices by opec action.
3828 2018-11-28 19:10:30 YEMEN YEMEN YEMEN YEMEN..................................Starving children and women and men, You bombed Syria for the "children"...........DOUBLE STANDARDS. Tell it like it is OIL OIL OIL MONEY MONEY MONEY....IRAN IRAN IRAN IRAN. Let the innocent die? Right?
3829 2018-11-28 19:10:26 TransCanada asks a Montana court to allow it to resume pre-construction activities on its Keystone XL oil pipeline after a U.S. judge blocked construction on the $8B project earlier this month.
3830 2018-11-28 19:10:24 Ohhhhhhhh so the pallet of cash in the dead of night in August of 2016 was to lower oil prices  that would take effect in November of 2018??

Got it.....
3831 2018-11-28 19:10:23 @CrownArabia Well done showing the world how subhuman, barbaric and backward all muslims are by murdering Khashoggi.@POTUS - lets develop our oil so we can bring our soldiers home & let the muslim dogs kill each other.
3832 2018-11-28 19:10:20 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
3833 2018-11-28 19:10:11 When you realize how hard it is to avoid vegetable oil in the grocery store its becomes clear why we all fucked up.
3834 2018-11-28 19:10:10 Agree Rex. All I want to say is this bastard tried his damnedest to shut down US oil production. Thank God the GOP Majority was there to slow him down. What a lying degenerate.
3835 2018-11-28 19:10:03 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
3836 2018-11-28 19:09:58 Ok so Trump is the only arrogant Prez.. yeah not s o much.. 0bama like most & Trump take all credit & no blame.. fact is on Oil he  vehemently to stifle production & export yet now that he's gone takes credit.. how Lib Social of you BO.. Ppl know the truth you were no fan of oil
3837 2018-11-28 19:09:52 - More oil, bastardo!

- Saudi debt peonage.

- Fuel-based fascism.

- Sacrilise this hydrocarbon!

- Oil ripens sin.
3838 2018-11-28 19:09:50 Add to that the royalty fees charged for pretty all tarsands extracts are around 1% of the #WTI price at the time of shipment...nothing to do with #WCS discounted price or that fictitious international price at *tidewater*. The province doesn’t suffer the discount, big oil does.
3839 2018-11-28 19:09:47 @HRHCancun is there anywhere that I can buy the essential oil blend you diffuse in the hotel and rooms? I absolutely love it, and haven't ever been able to find anything like it.
3840 2018-11-28 19:09:43 You need to try the @PalmersUK Coconut Oil range - it’s amazing! X
3841 2018-11-28 19:09:41 Ay nako. Dapat di na kakain eh. 3 pandesal, pancit canton, at sinigang ng ganitong oras 
3842 2018-11-28 19:09:31 UCP leader @jkenney is calling on the government to enact a mandatory 10% production curtailment on Alberta’s oil industry. Says the current differential means Alberta is essentially giving oil away. #ableg
3843 2018-11-28 19:09:29 I am tf guilty of all that. I need an oil change so bad and my car needs to be detailed 
3844 2018-11-28 19:09:19 If Obama hadn’t put policies in place to limit US oil production it wouldn’t have grown as much as it has since @realDonaldTrump  removed the regulations so in a way he is responsible for the oil boom. LOL
3845 2018-11-28 19:09:18 Have y’all ever had somebody oil your scalp after you got fresh braids  shit feels like heaven
3846 2018-11-28 19:09:14 Lol I’m so full it was great I love chilli oil so I loaded up & enjoyed .. it’s just I recently found this pho place really close by me 
3847 2018-11-28 19:09:12 Plastic is made from...guess what? OIL. It's long been my opinion that Big Oil exponentially increased the production of and public dependence upon plastic as a way to hedge their bets against the rise of alternative energy sources. They WILL make money off us one way or another.
3848 2018-11-28 19:09:07 What a lying POS. Did he find the Major Shale plays, advanced Hydro Fracking and directional drilling to access and get more oil and gas out. 
The arrogance of this narcissist makes me puke.
3849 2018-11-28 19:09:07 Wow. Notley controls international oil production and prices? 
Don't be so stupid.
3850 2018-11-28 19:09:06 Option C: “Tyler secretly falls in love with foo-foo drinks and starts sending his butler to pick one up each day, disguised by a cup that says “motor oil” on it to throw us off of his secret, shameful addiction.”
3851 2018-11-28 19:09:04 It’s been two hours & I’m still waiting on my oil change.... & I had an appointment.
3852 2018-11-28 19:09:00 Especially when you know the pilot is not yet even confirmed in the airport, and the preflight check must still be done. Appreciate wanting to save some loading time, and safety concern. But even then we had an oil issue so we took off two hours late.
3853 2018-11-28 19:08:57 I've lived through the coming ice age, overpopulation causing mass starvation, running out of oil, acid rain, hole in the ozone gonna burn us to a crisp...
Climate is incredibly complex. Sorry I'm skeptical when someone tells me with certainty what's going to happen in 100 yrs.
3854 2018-11-28 19:08:55 I remember Barack Obama torpedoing the Keystone Pipeline as one of his first celebrated moments as president. Now Obama claims he deserves the credit for America becoming the world's largest oil producer.
3855 2018-11-28 19:08:53  Brunch:

3856 2018-11-28 19:08:51 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
3857 2018-11-28 19:08:46 I've looked into getting one of those air fryers just never pulled the trigger. Do they actually fry stuff with out needing a breading or oil?
3858 2018-11-28 19:08:37 This old man is judging me for waiting so long to get an oil change when I been telling my dad for a month to do it
3859 2018-11-28 19:08:31 COME ON PIKERS....bid NG up to 4.67s...me wants hundreds more lots SHORT $NG #NG #NG_F $NG_F #NATGAS #OPEC #OIL #NATURALGAS $NGEZ #NGEZ #OOTT #FUTURES #DAYTRADING

I’m ready for Chopped.
3861 2018-11-28 19:08:28 Meself wey never travel self they watch am for phone... Same oil pha
3862 2018-11-28 19:08:25 I was sat in Coach C and it was all around the platform there - it was at least 5 metres of platform - it was all very slippy. It was like ingrained oil with water on top..
3863 2018-11-28 19:08:21 i have this oil for my hair that my mum recommended to me and good fucking lord my hair is so fucking soft it's a miracle worker
3864 2018-11-28 19:08:18 Maybe you should stop using everything that is made from oil.... Which is pretty much everything.
3865 2018-11-28 19:08:15 Of vourse i prefer pipeline with strong regulations, think feds finding balance with improved marine oversight etc, the oil will still move, as long as demand there, want to stop it? Stop buying cheap crap every year, remove demand. Support public transit, stop being wasteful.
3866 2018-11-28 19:08:14 from what i’ve observed, products for oily skin are usually cheaper!! the only products that moisturise my poor dying skin (and hair) are like $50+ and i have to use a ton  i will say tho it’s prob much easier to spray rosewater on my dry face than it’d be to get rid of oil
3867 2018-11-28 19:08:00 Yes our oil in the west is our oil All in the west are oil well owners! They companies purchase the rights to develope from the province! So yes I do own oil!
3868 2018-11-28 19:07:56 Does that "Vested Interest " happen to be Oil, Water, Electricity or Fishing by chance? Do you honestly believe that Westminster has your best interests at heart? They don't give a fcuk about the people,  it's the resources they need. Stand up off your knees.
3869 2018-11-28 19:07:53 ha like i dont know that they have been FIXING oil prices
3870 2018-11-28 19:07:44 kind of ironic that based on his profile pic he's no oil painting and yet he spends his time trying to insult stunning women on twitter. most likely cause he's too scared to even talk to women half as beautiful as you are irl.
3871 2018-11-28 19:07:40 The whole oil industry is a giant ponzi sham.  All the money we give away over the years we could all have our own refinery’s in each province. The price would be much more stable.  Greed is far more nessasary 4 society than common sence.
3872 2018-11-28 19:07:37 That really is wild that they be putting engine oil on them pancakes smh
3873 2018-11-28 19:07:10 oil is ai performance sentetic movements..  all is ai based kill SL and get profit whereever its go.. it is going down though with killing both sides. Artificial. 20 years trader here.. it got two doji in last 2 hours.. No way. Believe me no way other than synetic ai #crudeoil
3874 2018-11-28 19:06:53 BO wants to play both sides. He wants to be known as an environmentally-friendly Prez who put the kibosh on those evil offshore oil drillers but also he ushered in an eight-year oil boom (mostly from offshore drilling) that gave the U.S. energy independence for the first time.
3875 2018-11-28 19:06:50 Hair oil

3878 2018-11-28 19:06:45 Oil crisis the global price for oil is around 60-70$, Canadian oil 15-12$. This crisis is political and yes, due Liberal and NDP.

I went to Target and bought a coconut oil stick. There's a coupon on Cartwheel.
This has been Bre's Discount Beauty Counter and Target Coupon Update
3882 2018-11-28 19:06:26 We need to mobilise for policy to allow Governments to heavily tax Automobile and Oil companies that have contributed heavily towards climate change.

3884 2018-11-28 19:06:21 @jkenney describes the scale of the "emergency" and how we're on the verge of more layoffs if it continues. Just references the bottle of water and container of oil next to him, to make his point about the price and the cost to the treasury.
3885 2018-11-28 19:06:20 Don’t know if you’ve mentioned it. But how would the increase in rail oil reaching the coast affect the Tanker issue? I have guys telling me increased rail tankers can do more or less what it wants( not affected by NEB/ or TMX process). Seems nonsensical to me.

3888 2018-11-28 19:06:09 | Use hair masks regularly 

Using hair masks gives your hair extra moisture. It will make you hair so much softer and it will just give your hair like . I favour a Argan oil hair mask personally . 
3889 2018-11-28 19:05:56 market is bearish , because of American oil producers. they are the stubborn sellers .they always stop out buy side hedge funds..
3890 2018-11-28 19:05:53 @jkenney of opposition @Alberta_UCP says: "our oil is worth about 10 cents a litre, the fraction of the cost of a bottle of water," in news conference about oil differential. #ableg

3892 2018-11-28 19:05:45 FYI, the likes of Exxon, Shell, etc. (big oil) no longer fund any organization that denies the reality of man-made climate change.
From your comments related to Santorum, it doesn't sound like you're aware of this.

3900 2018-11-28 19:05:13 Soybean farming is destroying the Amazon, but soy beans doesn't attract the same flack as Oil Palm

Wonder why? U.S. is a major soybean producer

As the trade war with China progresses & Brazil takes advantage of the situation, expect greater focus on "destruction of the Amazon"
3901 2018-11-28 19:05:08 More wasted tax dollars down the drain quit borrowing money for a sinking ship you guys killed the oil why do tax payers have to bail it out? #stopthemadness
3902 2018-11-28 19:04:56 Right. He did everything he could to slow oil production. Offshore, fracking, dragging feet on Keystone, etc. Plus EPA rules & regs. Our increased production came in spite of Obama, not because of him.
3903 2018-11-28 19:04:55 There are also rail network and port congestion issues. You wouldn't necessarily prioritize oil shipments over grain, lumber, vehicles, transhipments of offshore imports to US, etc. Each has importance to shippers, and to the rail carriers.
3904 2018-11-28 19:04:51 oil makes me feel good
3905 2018-11-28 19:04:36 I have a Nissan Leaf, but we seriously considered getting a Volt. I have to say, EVs are wonderful. Pretty much zero maintenance and you can charge them while you sleep ... a trip to the gas station & oil changes, I don't even know what those are anymore.
3906 2018-11-28 19:04:34 A quick thought... 
Whenever there is down turn in the economy, the fed govt trade blames on price of oil dropped and so on... Truth is it never stays low, why don't they say "oh,  the price is high now" let the public know... @Gidi_Traffic 

A thread.
3907 2018-11-28 19:04:28 Gotta wake up early tomorrow so I can be first in line to get my tires rotated & balanced and get an oil change.
3908 2018-11-28 19:04:14 And that's the keyword "responsibility" . You know how Americans shit on the government when the oil prices go up. No administration wants that. And the dependence on oil well, theres nothing anybody can do about that for now. Well unless people are ready to sacrifice.
3909 2018-11-28 19:04:09 hey @DramaSarge bought an oil change

3913 2018-11-28 19:03:35 I really thought that choosing to write my paper while waiting at the dealership for an oil change would inspire me to not procrastinate yet here I am on twitter

3917 2018-11-28 19:03:17 Just when I thought I couldn't be surprised by this idiot any more - the audacity.  Gobsmacked.  Obama, the man who gave us oil?  Unbelievable.
3918 2018-11-28 19:03:09 Waiting for @jkenney to begin speaking in Edmonton. He has props. Looks like a container of oil and and bottle of water. I'm guessing it's a price comparison.

I remember. What JOY when we joined the EEC in 1975. #BrexitShambles
3922 2018-11-28 19:02:46 We notice when oil is down, all else does well. Just a coincidence.
3923 2018-11-28 19:02:44 Yes you can take your fish oil supplements with turmeric powder. There's no harm in that. Basically, it's like eating fish with spices. :)
3924 2018-11-28 19:02:37 The difference being the government bails out corporations in the East that shouldn’t get gov welfare because they want the votes. If AB had the seats, the gov would make damn sure the oil kept flowing. It’s disgusting and exactly why the west wants to separate!!

No! There's never been a good reason for skepticism.
Aside from partisan and big oil funded organizations, every major university and scientific institute on the planet has been in agreement for decades. You just weren't listening.

3933 2018-11-28 19:01:13 The government will change and the pipeline will get built and we are on the hook for useless rail cars.  OR nothing changes and the oil industry dies in this province and we are still on the hook for useless rail cars.
3934 2018-11-28 19:01:09 Wasn’t the owner some Russian oil man, assume he’s decided to not spend anymore money on them
3935 2018-11-28 19:01:05 Because the oil business is dieing due to the oil not being able to get to markets. Once there is a pipeline or in this case trains the price differential will be smaller and Alberta oil will be booming again

3973 2018-11-28 18:59:04 The oil companies that are making record profits are fully integrated. They own everything from production to refinery and they also invested heavily in automation when the oil nosedived in 2014.
3974 2018-11-28 18:59:04 I disagree. You’re right about major aspects of our economy but the only reason we have such a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia is because of our dependence on oil.

3986 2018-11-28 18:58:25 I agree. this is why looking into battery technology for larger vehicle so it can be used for future electric car. Also Alberta should look into road that can self charge instead of looking at oil for their growth.

And they pump more oil
Obama says it, they cut output
4013 2018-11-28 18:55:56 Lamb chops in red wine sauce - which also contains olive oil, garlic, fresh plum tomatoes, courgettes, mushrooms and oregano.  Served with fresh tagliatelle.  Hungry before I've made it...
4014 2018-11-28 18:55:54 how many fucking motor oil and cardboard pancake posts am i going to see before yall stop
4015 2018-11-28 18:55:51 no, its a nice incentive to get us off of oil and onto clean American power
4016 2018-11-28 18:55:46 Lot of oil in Venezuela.  You didn’t think world power would let their government share it with the people?
Dangerous precedent, then it could happen anywhere.   Starve them out, Libya model, take your pick.   Authoritarianism to the rescue.

4019 2018-11-28 18:55:35 Roughly $3.3 billion in oil subsidies - imagine if that was redirected to wind/solar projects instead. Not to mention the $4.5 billion pipeline thing we now own for some reason (I know the reasons, it's an exacerbated 'for some reason').
4020 2018-11-28 18:55:28 If arrogance is oil.
4021 2018-11-28 18:55:23 Had pancakes this morning and lemme tell ya, that motor oil hit the spot

4023 2018-11-28 18:55:21 This damn oil change is taking forever
4024 2018-11-28 18:55:16 @RachelNotley hey Rachel, wouldn't it make more sense to invest in setting up refineries in Alberta instead, it would turn into a huge profit center for the province, stimulating oil production as well as a tremendous amount of employment (and spinoffs)
4025 2018-11-28 18:55:16 You’re not thinking big enough! How about all metal construction? Self transforming? Smells like oil and burnt rubber? The possibilities are endless!!
4026 2018-11-28 18:55:15 @suziesgoodfats What exactly would you categorize as "bad fats," considering your product has a wonderful mix of saturated fat and seed oils? I see pictures of coconut oil and avocados on your website, but your products contain peanut oil and sunflower oil as well.
4027 2018-11-28 18:55:12 I will PAY someone to clean my car inside and out , go take it to get an oil change , adjust the tire pressures, fix my window wipers , and anything else that needs to be done  name your price 
4028 2018-11-28 18:55:12 Obama taking credit for the US Oil boom is like Julio Lugo claiming he's a great SS because he was the starting SS for the 2007 Red Sox.
4029 2018-11-28 18:55:10 If it wasn't for the oil, the arms deals and the loans..I'm sure no Western government would ever deal with this wahabbist nightmare kingdom.
4030 2018-11-28 18:55:05 Oil is on a part of our overall resource and economy. We give you a low rate for our oil as your neighbour. Sorry you do not like your 40% of oil that we supply to Americans,
4031 2018-11-28 18:55:05 I wanna try cbd oil for anxiety
4032 2018-11-28 18:55:03 Russia had a second, smaller Oil reserve in Siberia.  And on defense tgey wouldn't need as much oil.
Food would be their big problem.
4033 2018-11-28 18:55:03 NDP anti oil, hyper marxist-environmentalist policy coming home to roost, and the NDP doesn't like it...

4042 2018-11-28 18:54:36 So you put your sample, make laser azimuthal with your objective (100X oil) and measure the spot size and power above the objective?
4043 2018-11-28 18:54:32 Today Premier Notley announced she is buying rail tanker cars to get oil to market.  A pipeline is more efficient, safe and will leave rail capacity for other products.  This is crazy!
4044 2018-11-28 18:54:29 Print the name "Bombardier" on each train and the money from Ottawa will flow like oil...
4045 2018-11-28 18:54:29 Perhaps if hadn't spent the first 2 years of ur mandate trying 2 kill the oil industry and calling us sewer rats &  Canada's embarrassing cousin, we may b in a better position now. It's not entirely your fault, but  You sure as hell didn't help. Alberta & Canada deserve better.

4057 2018-11-28 18:53:29 What is he going to say or do when MBS cuts oil production? These low oil prices are a bribe to keep trump siding w/MBS. Saudi Arabia, MBS, is bribing trump to side w/MBS over the murder of Kashoggi.
4058 2018-11-28 18:53:24 Yeah, which is great, because we can all high-five each other while Saudi Arabia picks up the slack.  Oil demand is rising still globally, not falling.  This is its own issue, but Canada does not do itself, nor the planet, any favours by not selling our oil in that market.
4059 2018-11-28 18:53:22 I believe that the @CIA killed Kahshoggi to implicate MBS have his removed and their stooge put in place. Their stooge would stop oil production and ramp up crap around the globe. @POTUS is right to stay with MBS

4063 2018-11-28 18:53:13 Obama taking credit for America becoming world’s largest oil producer? What a joke. He must be delirious or thinks his followers r really dumb and will buy into anything. The guy did nothing.

4069 2018-11-28 18:52:44 By making the US the world's largest exporter of oil, Trump has put Russia, Iran, & Saudi in a weak negotiating position to say the least.  Stupid Adam Schiff accuses Trump of catering to Russian & Saudi financial interests.  Schiff needs a new brain.
4070 2018-11-28 18:52:41 I love how Iceland are passionate about saving the orangutans and cutting out palm oil but they’re using meat to advertise it. Like a bit hypocritical. QUICK SAVE THE ORANGUTANS BUT FUCK ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY TASTE NICE.
4071 2018-11-28 18:52:34 A really hard reality for a Country strongly dependent on Oil Exports profits to cover imports of a vast quantity and quality of goods it is unable to produce.

Some will say it is a war against our Country.

4075 2018-11-28 18:52:16 Well, what's happening? Are people dying? Hardly anyone knows what sanctions means here. They think it has to do with oil businesses.
4076 2018-11-28 18:52:14 Dont forget oil
4077 2018-11-28 18:52:09 I think state owned oil companies should not exist for profit, neither should my greedy government be taxing the hell out of commodities like fuel.

4088 2018-11-28 18:51:48 They were plenty of countries that gave off oil.
4089 2018-11-28 18:51:47 Cuz I could taste it when you said what you were eating. Prolly some weak ass oil dressing on it too huh
4090 2018-11-28 18:51:46 Good. Now go change the oil, rotate the tires, check the air filter, take out the trash, mow the grass, clean the pool, wash the car, paint the trim, fix the leaky roof, unclog the drain, fix the computer, change the cat litter, move the couch, get the boxes down from the attic.

4123 2018-11-28 18:49:16 True. I wonder how this situation evolved, since the sale of oil isn’t making some oil companies money? It’s costing them. Which is why some industry CEO’s are requesting government step in. I know why.

4131 2018-11-28 18:48:55 It may say that GM and Ford are not making the right Sedans that customers want. It does not helpt that the president is down on electric cars and wants to push oil and gas. Campanies that are large have trouble changing directions. Microsoft solves this by buying other companies
4132 2018-11-28 18:48:53 Praise God for seeing you through.  The horrible lows in the oil industry during the arrogant ass' time, destroyed a couple of families I know in Texas.  Thank God things were set right again.  Obama wanted any oil money to flow to his muslim terrorist brotherhood.
4133 2018-11-28 18:48:48 Daily reminder- @BarackObama is the most narcissistic person on earth, has dreams that he created this economy, oil exploration, low unemployment.....  if fact he was the worst President of our time.  #Narcissist
4134 2018-11-28 18:48:47 Right, and your opinion was basically "I can assume this is nonsense because it had some words my mom says are naughty"

Oil companies used the same tactics as tobacco companies to sow doubt in good science. Many of the same PEOPLE, even. Look into it.

4136 2018-11-28 18:48:34 Venezuela's financial structure, thereby the country, has collapsed. Weren't they a major source of crude oil? If so, Gov't theft of funds? Is embezzlement an issue? Where's the money? Swiss banks? Beautifully adorned mansions? Interesting.

4156 2018-11-28 18:47:06 Ah makes sense then. Hopefully there are jumps, obstacles, and the cars can deploy smoke screens and oil slicks.
4157 2018-11-28 18:47:00 You are the slaves of oil and politics. The history will judge you by your big mistake with supporting Iran's evil regime.

4160 2018-11-28 18:46:44 Dr Wang,  I suggest you read the literature before you embarrass yourself further. Blindly following what the dummies say about Mineral Oil is a sure-fire way to ruin a MD reputation - unless your agenda is something other than healing people - fleecing perhaps?  $AMRN
4161 2018-11-28 18:46:43 do an aloe vera and coconut oil hair mask leave it on for an hour before you shower, twice a week makes a world of difference!
4162 2018-11-28 18:46:42 Oh yeah it was you Hussein who stopped all the oil production so the oil companies had to go overseas. Oh yeah it was you Hussein, Who almost ruined our economy but now you want to take the credit for what President Trump has done. Narcissistic Power Hunger Muslim Gitmo Qualified
4163 2018-11-28 18:46:42 LMAO ! 

$56 million is less than pocket change in the oil industry. Oil companies have spent $1,000+ million on dry holes !

See reported results - “less than 300 barrels/day” in 2015 - “200 barrels/day” more recently.

They are scraping a knife down in the ketchup bottle.

4187 2018-11-28 18:45:29 on energy, who is for green? obama just said “ your welcome” for him making us biggest oil producer. coupe days ago.
4188 2018-11-28 18:45:24 How is it going to affect the 3rd world's working class, esp. Eth. the oil prices hike two weeks ago ? Prices on every commodity is going to go up, etc. ! What to do ? Why does CIA pull this off now, after vowing to flood the world with the newly opened US oil ?! Discuss.
4189 2018-11-28 18:45:21 When I was in the wind business the big pushers of this global warming idiocy where the oil companies like Shell and BP. They also fund academics.

And it's easy to understand why - higher energy prices through gormless green policies mean MORE PROFITS for oil companies.
4190 2018-11-28 18:45:20 зачем другим знать этот аспект статистики
4191 2018-11-28 18:45:16 I am not familiar with the substance of oil companies climate change denial policies nor do I care. But I will work to expose blowhards like Al Gore who profit from deceiving the public on global warming. Nice talking to you. I’m done.

4200 2018-11-28 18:44:37 We play a game in our youth group about family budgeting. What expenses do we have that are not planned? So far, I have things like lost jacket, broken phone screen, oil change, new tires.

4203 2018-11-28 18:44:18 The US is the only country in the world that, by itself, has all natural resources, water, wind, hydro, coal, gas, solar, etc. We could live on our own for about 80 yrs w/no help. Many places in the world have tons more oil than us, thousands of years worth while new oil creates.

4205 2018-11-28 18:44:00 I suspect he killed the girls before she got home, called a friend volunteering to run out to the oil fields instead of him, followed by murdering his wife on her arrival home.

4207 2018-11-28 18:43:56 There was a lot of room to innovate - but things like alternative energy techs/vehicles, for instance, require large infrastructure changes. A change that works in the short term and makes money right now. Waiting until oil/coal is too expensive/rare, or the damage to our planet-
4208 2018-11-28 18:43:56 im loving it.  also doesnt have the emotional lows of not smoking i experience with all this strong ass hash oil i been smoking.
4209 2018-11-28 18:43:53 It’s possible!! It’s said to help with chronic pain! You could always try & see. It doesn’t have side affects & has no THC. It’s a natural oil.
4210 2018-11-28 18:43:52 Obama did everything he could to slow oil & coal production, Trump deregulated the industries. Now Obama wants credit for Trump's deregulation, economy & low unemployment? Trump found the magic wand that Obama couldn't!
4211 2018-11-28 18:43:41 Canadian conservative voters keep falsely saying pipeline protesters are only from other countriesand complain environmentalists receive money from USA groups  so then smugly dismiss all environmentalists and REFUSE to even recognize DARK OIL LOBBY spends 1000X MORE money
4212 2018-11-28 18:43:41 Producing oil and selling snake oil are not the same. He is confused.

4215 2018-11-28 18:43:31 Grains/oilseeds find buyer interest ahead of the weekend G20 and US-China talks. Today's Fed talk and stock market may be viewed as supportive of commodities. However, crude oil moved to record supplies.

4217 2018-11-28 18:43:23 The only thing that is precious about their union is our oil!
4218 2018-11-28 18:43:21 You know, if we hooked Obama up to a lie detector about this, the needle wouldn't even budge.  He really, truly believes he's the one that made the US oil boom happen.  Just ignore 8 years of his attacks on coal and fracking and his repeated refusal to approve pipelines.
4219 2018-11-28 18:43:18 What's up with the 'engine oil' jokes? idgi
4220 2018-11-28 18:43:14 Canada is a oil company disguised as a country.

4222 2018-11-28 18:43:05 Are they purchasing it now? Even if they do purchase our oil that does nothing to prevent industry from over production and us being in this situation all over again

4230 2018-11-28 18:42:50 Your right Secretary Pompeo-like you I am waiting for them to run out of oil money-then we don´t have to kiss ass anymore for their grievous offences against humanity!
4231 2018-11-28 18:42:45 And let the Iranians surround the Saudi Oil Reserces, the Straits of Hormuz? Brilliant, Bernie.

I often made excuses for myself.

I forget to close the bathroom.

The cabinet doors open because I went to deliberate with the oil.

The basement door opens because the lock is broken.
4236 2018-11-28 18:42:34 I did vote for this relief, however to be specific, the carbon tax the PC gov removed was 4.8cents/litre. To take credit for the oil surplus by OPEC is a strong stretch..correct me if i am wrong. @GasBuddyDan

4240 2018-11-28 18:42:16 Well yeah he just had the press conference where he changed his view, give it a month! How much do you think oil played into his change of heart?
4241 2018-11-28 18:42:15 I’m so glad we’re all collectively traumatized by motor oil being used as syrup in ads
4242 2018-11-28 18:42:14 Climate researchers aren’t paying the salaries at CNN. Oil and gas companies are.
4243 2018-11-28 18:42:14 I was born there and still I say: Fuck you, Alberta. If you're suffering, step away from oil and focus on agriculture again or green energy. No one wants your dirty oil anymore.
4244 2018-11-28 18:42:13 Due to not being in a war with the allies , Germany coukd import enough oil. Russian navy wasn't a match. 

Sure the russians coukd have also imported things but not as much as the lend leases they recieved.

4247 2018-11-28 18:41:59 What about fuel prices Mr. Aristotle of Pakistan? When internationally oil prices are down from 87 dollars to 50 dollars, what you doing? Just doing corruption with extra money of the people. Your ( Munafiqat) is opened. Just null and void cabinet of Qadiyanis and Jews agents.
4248 2018-11-28 18:41:47 @MeghanMcCain your father took a lot of money from big oil companies for years. Will you donate your inheritance from your him to help fight the damage big oil is doing to the environment? Also, stop demanding the audience stop clapping because they don't agree with you.
4249 2018-11-28 18:41:47 а в чем прикол что у многих публикуется такое
4250 2018-11-28 18:41:47 IMO this is more than an oil bust. The @OilGasCanada is not cost effective. Cheap oil is gone. Expensive stuff can't be extracted w/o free water, no upfront money for liabilities and the guarantee of Redwater decision to ensure that taxpayers pay for these liabilities. Permanent.
4251 2018-11-28 18:41:40 “That was me.”  How, dear god, did an anti-capitalist, anti-fossil fuel tree hugger trigger the oil boom?  I’m sure there were several challenging questions to follow.

4260 2018-11-28 18:41:03 Our oil reserves wont be around forever, so it's good to stay on good terms for when we need their oil, why are you defending Trump??
4261 2018-11-28 18:41:03 I make my own cream mixes and oil mixes

You are so full of Crap!
What a Dumbass you are Mr @BarackObama!
One of your biggest priorities was to block the keystone pipeline to keep us from using U S oil!
Only your snowflake Liberal minions believes anything you have say!
You need to just go away!
4263 2018-11-28 18:40:50 I guess in a way-he screwed up the country and caused us to elect Trump who actually made America the largest oil producer.

4265 2018-11-28 18:40:43 ..... says the Snake Oil salesmen.
4266 2018-11-28 18:40:38 It will take some work to get the poisons out. The Holy oil of Christ will do so over a few month's time. Virgin olive oil, cannabis buds, myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil. Jesus took it from the evil priests and gave it to the common man which was a crime.
4267 2018-11-28 18:40:37 He isn't "stealing" from anybody with half a head.  Intelligent people KNOW this "oil boom" is President Trump's WINNING.

4271 2018-11-28 18:40:28 He's delusional. There were so many laid off in the oil fields, including several of my family members. Thank God some of them were hired back this past year.
4272 2018-11-28 18:40:27 Ladies: If you out here with bald tires and no oil change please stop speeding and reevaluate your life
4273 2018-11-28 18:40:27 I don't think he is being ignorant. He's stating his lived experience. It's different for everyone. Small business is struggling. Oil sector workers struggling. These are facts. We have a recession that will continue for ages. Influx of public dollars propping it up for now.

4289 2018-11-28 18:39:37 Obama didn't allow any oil pipelines. How is he taking  credit now??
4290 2018-11-28 18:39:36 Yea,  why must they break it, its 10 times better than this.
4291 2018-11-28 18:39:34 I hope so! I have hated this disgraceful conference since we joined. Know we needed somewhere to go but this conference “sux”. I hope they drown in their TX pride. All because of the almighty oil dollars from UT.

4296 2018-11-28 18:39:15 Proving how truly incompetent he was.  Raise your hand if you believe Obama 1) wanted to make the rich even richer during his term or 2) Increase domestic oil production from fracking and drive DOWN oil prices world wild.  Those things happened despite him.

4298 2018-11-28 18:39:13 That's a silly question. The right question is why the fuck should we believe you? I mean, if a doctor misdiagnosed me I'd go and see a doctor with better credentials, not a provincial snake oil quack like yourself.
4299 2018-11-28 18:39:09 I hear stopping oil production helps make us the largest oil producer.  He’s the fool in the room!
4300 2018-11-28 18:39:05 #USsanctions If US succeeds in shutting in large portion of Iran’s oil exports, it cud cause full-blown economic crisis. The economic crisis is playing out across Iran. At the end of the day sanctions always hurt ordinary people ,that is their purpose.#TradeWar .

28 years and still spot on
4308 2018-11-28 18:38:26 I’m with you on regulation. I think it is too little too late. Now, we need to harness the power of competition. We need to get oil companies to fall over each other to be the cleanest, most egalitarian, most responsible of all. We do that by putting one scapegoat company down.
4309 2018-11-28 18:38:21 Can’t get our oil to market is different problem from GM and Chrysler. Or Air Canada  - people are always buying cars, taking trips - why can’t they be self-prosperous?  Mismanagement- top heavy most likely - with big salaries at the top.

4312 2018-11-28 18:38:13 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts flaxseed oil with 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 part fruit puree. Add rosemary and jaggery to taste.
4313 2018-11-28 18:38:08 You want to help this, Andrew? Then do this:  Large tax breaks on every one of the 3 million bbls/day we EXPORT to the USA and steep tariff on every one of the 1 million bbls/day we IMPORT to eastern Canada --> this is Incentive to the EE pipe, incentive to upgrade oil in Canada
4314 2018-11-28 18:38:08 He did everything in his power to slow oil production in the US. The oil industry was creative enough to work around his restrictions and thrive despite them. He deserves zero credit. Actually less than zero.
4315 2018-11-28 18:37:57 Not living in the past at all, that is for your own education, which is sorely lacking. The economy, record breaking employment with good high paying jobs, foreign trade deals that have supercharged the steel industry, #1 world oil production and much more. Get better information
4316 2018-11-28 18:37:55 Obama  is delusional! He was the green windmill solar guy -not the oil guy!  We can thank him for spending lots of green$ on that and getting us nowhere!!
4317 2018-11-28 18:37:53 My question is...if we're ab;e to export oil, why in the hell are we importing any oil? Seems silly to buy oil on the foreign market if we have enough at home...#justsaying
4318 2018-11-28 18:37:52 I’m surprised the US Army hasn’t gone after the oil paintings
4319 2018-11-28 18:37:47 @Shell_Canada your synthetic oil rebate program is bulls**t. Online rebate form doesn’t submit, rebate website doesn’t actually exist, rebate help phone line has only pre-recorded answers to FAQ. Don’t offer a rebate if you don’t want to honour it!
4320 2018-11-28 18:37:47 Shut up and eat the oil
4321 2018-11-28 18:37:44 So the latest update on Dennis. My mum dropped the olive oil lid on the floor and she went into tr garage to get something. When she got back she caught him licking it

4329 2018-11-28 18:37:10 why don't you consider going after Amazon as a monopoly that is driving out all other businesses?  Teddy Roosevelt did it with Standard Oil.  May you can go after Amazon, FB, Google... try it - for the people.
4330 2018-11-28 18:37:08 You could sector diversify in other commodities.  The ones I'm attracted to at the moment are oil, copper, and especially uranium.

I think Peter is under certain restrictions from regulators so that he can't make specific stock picks.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Have you got one of those curly oil lamps?
4333 2018-11-28 18:37:00 Go ask your Governors. You elected them. We elcted ours too. And for your info, oil is no longer the major foreign exchange earner in Naija. Agric is. Hope you get that
4334 2018-11-28 18:36:56 This isn't going to help the economy and the conservatives don't have a solution either. Decades of non-diversification in the energy sector is the root cause, not moving oil. It's also part of the cause for the GM plant to close.
4335 2018-11-28 18:36:41 $10. for a barrel of Canadian Western oil.. Does this affect my Canadian RRSP's and Mutual Funds?  Seems they have dropped in value of late.
4336 2018-11-28 18:36:41 Havent you heard??? Obama is now taking credit for the recent oil boom and declining gas prices...LMAO
4337 2018-11-28 18:36:24 Obama said a LOT of anti oil,  anti offshore drilling, but his administration did open up land leases in the contiguous 48.  Look at oil production in the US per year.
4338 2018-11-28 18:36:22 so instead of politely encouraging one mouse not to drink my chilli oil, I have to slaughter a whole family of mice and send a message to the mouse community?
4339 2018-11-28 18:36:21 Obama said America is the largest oil producer because of him. by Obama blocking the pipeline and blocking oil exploration ect. He is part of the  problem and the reason gas prices are so high , you want people to thank you ,so thanks Obama for NOTHING!! #Trump2020
4340 2018-11-28 18:36:16 That may be the case and I wish them the best! But what matters to me is they are still burning imported oil and blocking Canadian product! Have heard no mention of protests for pipelines anywhere but in the west! Everywhere protests against Canadian product deny the west?
4341 2018-11-28 18:36:11 BURR: You haven't saw him yet, you haven't had the finch, 'cause he's been explaining oil as the ambassador to France!

4343 2018-11-28 18:35:52 Billionaire means unfair economy, that’s nothing to be proud of. Look at US, worlds richest country, yet 38% living under poverty line. Every developing country need to kick start industrialization with loan, unless you can export natural resources like oil.
4344 2018-11-28 18:35:49 Is Canada really an oil company instead of a country?
4345 2018-11-28 18:35:49 Na fool him be na

4348 2018-11-28 18:35:42 It pushed prices lower. It's similar to the lpg market. It's a good thing in a lot of ways and the long run, but for now oil and gas jobs aren't as abundant as they were ~5 years ago.
4349 2018-11-28 18:35:38 Gove has once again showed his inability to back the right horse. He's going down with his disastrous PM. He's a disloyal snake oil salesman who deserves decades in the political wilderness.
4350 2018-11-28 18:35:32 Then he should take full credit for destroying the planet with climate change from the burning of his oil. lol

4354 2018-11-28 18:35:19 You want credit for the oil boom?  As soon as you take responsibility for those who died and were injured in Benghazi when you wouldn’t lift a finger to help them, I’ll think about it.
4355 2018-11-28 18:35:18 Wow.  What a convenient memory this guy has.  He fought the US oil industry tooth and nail.  He blocked oil pipelines and tried to close fracking and shale oil companies.
4356 2018-11-28 18:35:17 Oil is priced in dollars pound down fuel price up.
4357 2018-11-28 18:35:07 It is useful to go back to earlier years and observe the duration of unemployment since 2000, when the oil economy was humming along. At that time duration was about 10 wks. The fact it is now 20+ wks is an important measure of how the economy has changed for the worse. 1/n

4360 2018-11-28 18:34:49 You may have to live somewhere in the oil patch to realize just how facepalm ironic this statement is. 

When I say Obama about ruined the economies on Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast with his EOs relative to the drilling industry - it is NOT an exaggeration.

4363 2018-11-28 18:34:44 Assets remain assets though they can wear out. Helping industry remain open can create social goods and tax revenues, including from oil. Taxpayers subsidize lots of things, even almost everything! I say damn the naysayers, build the dam pipelines and get to work on growing GDP.
4364 2018-11-28 18:34:35 @realDonaldTrump Please don't risk our march to energy independence by tweeting oil down to levels that negatively impact the viability of our E&P (non-traditional production) industry.  We are very close to that point now.
4365 2018-11-28 18:34:35 Trump wants lower oil price... pushed Saudis... oil collapsed. 
Trump wants lower rates... pushed Powell... Fed folded.
Trump wants lower trade deficit... pushed China... ???

4368 2018-11-28 18:34:23 1/2 Two issues not well explained. 1. AB oil is priced at refinery gate, including shipping cost. It's much more expensive to ship by rail than via pipeline. 2. Shipping constraints favour unconstrained US sources. Both contribute to "discount". 2/

4373 2018-11-28 18:33:44 Fair enough. But I’m mystified why u think significantly increasing the amount of oil going by rail( and therefore logically > tanker traffic) is somehow of no concern when increasing pipeline capacity is. They both result in more marine traffic.
4374 2018-11-28 18:33:37 Germany lacked the oil required to win any war lasting more than 6-12 months.

4384 2018-11-28 18:32:33 Obama trying to take credit for the oil boom and economy, just shows that he thinks the American people are all stupid. Truth is that only@half of the people are stupid. It’s not the conservative half.
4385 2018-11-28 18:32:25 My heart cries tears of blood when I see our soldier's blood. Terrorists should be killed and burnt with  pig oil.
4386 2018-11-28 18:32:24 his oppression of the oil industry did set the stage for this boom. So there is that.
4387 2018-11-28 18:32:22 Climate change guy, who wanted to stop all the drilling, close down all the factories and coal mines turns around and starts taking credit for booming oil production when the guy after him reversed all his policies. The audacity.

Indeed, UK oil is used by the UK.

Scotland raises around £10Bn less in tax etc (including 100% oil attribution) than it spends on public services. Thus that money is spent here having been raised in England

4430 2018-11-28 18:30:06 Ohh good point! And I agree, oil is TOO messy  (I prefer inks and drawing too). btw for how long have you been practicing traditional painting?
4431 2018-11-28 18:29:59 Somethings here in the city of Montebello are questionable like the population, demographics, home ownership, Montebello Police Department, Chamber of Commerce, City Council, Montebello Hills, Human Sacrafice Rituals conducted throughout the city, and body disposal in Oil Field.
4432 2018-11-28 18:29:54 Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was me people ... say thank you."

To quote him   "YOU DIDN"T BUILD THAT"
4433 2018-11-28 18:29:46 Mum’s just asked me what hair oil I’d put on my hair when in actual fact I have no products in it and just need to wash it. What a confidence boost
4434 2018-11-28 18:29:45 Dude had more regulations on oil than TSA has on flying.
4435 2018-11-28 18:29:43 Dan, for an uninformed soul like me, can you explain why Canada's price for oil is so darn low?
4436 2018-11-28 18:29:21 QURAN > HADITH.

quran trumps hadith. so fuck ur stupid Qarchad tree story, as u see we plant Eucalyptus and use Eucalyptus oil to heal. Unlike u, who burn tires to give yourself cancer.
4437 2018-11-28 18:29:17 GOP & Dems 2 wings of the same vulture; owned by Wall St., Banksters, Big Oil, Big Insurance, Big Pharma, Military & Prison Industrial Complexes. Like Deep Throat said, "FOLLOW THE MONEY". Campaign contributions reveal them ALL as whores!
4438 2018-11-28 18:29:10 Άστες συνηθισμένες νερόβραστες γενικολογίες περί ΔΔΟ. Τι σημαίνει για σένα και τι σημαίνει για το ΑΚΕΛ η ΔΔΟ? π.χ. ποιές συγκεκριμένες πρόνοιες πολιτικής ισότητας θεωρεί αποδεκτές το ΑΚΕΛ και ποιές εσύ?  Ο κόσμος εβαρέθηκε τα μασκαραλλίκια. Ο ΠΤΔ το έχει αντιληφθεί, εσύ ακόμα.
4439 2018-11-28 18:29:09 Oil se koi farq ni hoga. App confidence se banao
4440 2018-11-28 18:28:42 It's really up to what kind of painting you want to do. Watercolor isn't quite as versatile. Oil is fun if you're working with texture and spatulas and being more rough and experimental but it has more mess as a consequence
4441 2018-11-28 18:28:41 Daisy can tell when I've opened a jar of coconut oil from anywhere in the apartment - even if I'm cooking and opening a ton of other containers she KNOWS the coconut oil sound. And she also knows I will give her some. So smart!
4442 2018-11-28 18:28:26 Actually, I'm pretty sure that this is due to oil workers and companies and not solely Obummer or Drumpf
4443 2018-11-28 18:28:23 ....says the POTUS whom single handedly pushed the oil industry into one of the worst downturns in the last fifty years. No one in the oil industry is thanking him. #goaway
4444 2018-11-28 18:28:20 Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the Sauds enabler, United States. Pure and simple the price of cheaper oil, and the billions the Sauds are waving like a gold shroud is America being complicit in Saudi Arabia COMPLETE SEIZURE of YEMEN using the SAME BARBARITY as ASSAD in order to
4445 2018-11-28 18:28:20 You once against old man from the Indians for an oil line why are we depending on Saudi Arabia
4446 2018-11-28 18:28:10 Igenex is 800 bucks and then if you get a positive another 400 to 600 dollars.  So we decided that if I did have it, we were going to try and "agitate" it with the ess oil treatment so when I go to do the standard test it is very possible it will show up.  We are giving
4447 2018-11-28 18:28:03 @LiciaCorbella ..'let the eastern bastards freeze to death'its our oil hands off' now that the US is exporting oil (dont need ours) & our production has increased with NO MARKET AB is whining&blaming everyone except their own lack of vision pipelinesshld have been built 40yrs ago
4448 2018-11-28 18:28:00 It was so important to run that oil line through the Indians property are gas prices should be lower
4449 2018-11-28 18:27:55 @jimbraude. btw Today’s ultra low sulfur n bio diesel laced heating oil is cleaner than gas especially when you count gas leaks.
4450 2018-11-28 18:27:54 Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was me people ... say thank you."

Delusional?
4451 2018-11-28 18:27:53 He also shut down drilling in the Gulf which hit the oil industry hard.  Many people got laid off in the energy sector because of his actions, and that sector is still trying to find it's legs again.
4452 2018-11-28 18:27:53 Sir, I saw you once at Stanford 20 years ago, and at the NY Athletic Club about 13 years ago. You are the greatest of all time in the amount and quality of knowledge you've shared throughout your career. Hats off.
4453 2018-11-28 18:27:52 @barackobama will soon explain that he invented the internet, the space age, the modern airplane, the automobile, the fermentation process that creates beer and writing.  Each of these claims is just as credible as his claims about the economy and oil and gas production. @POTUS
4454 2018-11-28 18:27:47 .@LeoDiCaprio Mr. Climate Change, contributed 418 tons of CO2. 

@algore Sold current TV to Al Jazeera (oil & gas), for 500 million. How many houses & cars does he have? How many private planes? 

It’s ok to be massive hypocrites if you have $ & a platform. #ClimateChange
4455 2018-11-28 18:27:46 That snake oil doesn't taste so good now.
4456 2018-11-28 18:27:45 Not because of you Obama, oil was done in the private sector. Obama restricted it everywhere he could.
4457 2018-11-28 18:27:43 I just went to leave & freaked out because my car was not where I parked it..... cuz it’s getting an oil change at Midas 
4458 2018-11-28 18:27:33 Obama is a narcissist! He reduced our oil production while in office. Now he's claiming responsibility for the oil boom! Oh and he says we NEED to say thank you!

Ok...thank you @realDonaldTrump
You deserves the credit for our booming economy and oil!
4459 2018-11-28 18:27:30 I enjoyed listening to #Ramatlhodi so much I put the tools down. No pretense. No caution. Nothing rehearsed. And this is a clear indication that he was speaking the truth. Huuuu but I’m going to be burning the midnight oil tonight! 
4460 2018-11-28 18:27:26 Ahahahha you are responsible for the present oil situation? Bahahahahhaha you are delusional, but nice try 
4461 2018-11-28 18:27:25 I’m bringing in an analogy to the BP oil spill just to spice up my life I don’t know if I’m making any sense
4462 2018-11-28 18:27:23 Correlation is not causation.  If he wants to point to actions he took that can be rightfully be linked to oil production, then perhaps he can claim credit.  If not, he is just doing what he does best:  preening.
4463 2018-11-28 18:27:12 PSA: don’t cook with hot oil in a sports bra... lolzzzz 
4464 2018-11-28 18:27:12 Wait, didn’t you hear? Obama said he is the reason America is producing more oil. 
4465 2018-11-28 18:27:11 My brother's partner was invited to the Deeside Scottish visit. HR manager for Middle East oil company. Not exactly representative.
4466 2018-11-28 18:27:11 Except for him and his penned regulations America had the potential to be #1 in oil production. But he had to go for the potential to be realized. #LockThemAllUp
4467 2018-11-28 18:27:11 Savez-vous que le litre d'essence en Californie est à 0,80€ et le gaz oil n'existe pas, et pour cause, chez nous on a élaboré ce carburant pour consommer moins et qu'il soit moins cher pour les routiers et les gros rouleurs, et aujourd'hui, le prix du litre dépasse l'essence
4468 2018-11-28 18:27:11 This is why it is advised for people to be quiet. If you had listened, folks wouldn't have known how stupid you are. Now see.... Your foolishness has poured all over the place like red oil and you've dragged your family along. Mumu.
4469 2018-11-28 18:27:08 The World is funny,If e Gvt finds diamonds or Oil in my backyard it becomes Gvt property.If they find drugs that shit is mine SMH
4470 2018-11-28 18:27:04 We could get Scotland's oil to pay for it...  no wait
4471 2018-11-28 18:26:58 You conveniently ignore the world oil glut, Andrew. That’s a @liberal_party fault, is it? 
#CDNpoli
4472 2018-11-28 18:26:50 Because it’s important to know what a paid shill of the oil and gas industry thinks about climate change?
4473 2018-11-28 18:26:38 Can’t remember the last time someone compared my periods to different types of oil  hes a romantic this one.
4474 2018-11-28 18:26:37 Obama campaigned against big oil...he's lying..
4475 2018-11-28 18:26:36 Right on! Very few people know that Buffet bought up the railroads transporting oil from the Bakken shale and Canada. The fix was in long ago.
4476 2018-11-28 18:26:27 I'm sorry... " discount on Canadian oil" ?
4477 2018-11-28 18:26:16 When the crude oil was trading at 140 $ per barrel and when the yardstick to measure GDP was not discounted.
4478 2018-11-28 18:26:15 I hope whoever nominated me for that poll breaks a nail after leaving the nail shop 

I hope your beautician cuts off too much hair 

I hope when you go get an oil change that they tell you that you need an alternator
4479 2018-11-28 18:26:15 Are those razor bumps ...she need some coconut oil and tea tree/Rose hips bc NAH
4480 2018-11-28 18:26:09 I’m fairly sure they’ve said that Neck Oil and a session Spurs-only beer will be available at all bars, and there’ll be a little taproom with ltd edition things/experimental stuff in the SE corner for post-match. I was hoping for pints of spresso before the 12:45 kickoffs though
4481 2018-11-28 18:26:05 What has that to do with this convo? I’m not denying it. Just saying if u want to move considerably more oil in tankers you’ll need more marine regs, as promised for TMX expansion. Perhaps it’s akready in place. I have no idea. But I doubt it.
4482 2018-11-28 18:26:02 There is only a tiny grain of truth in this. There have been businesses propped up for political reasons across the country—including the oil patch. ON & QC have 65% of the population and economy. It stands to reason they have more of the businesses. All parts of...
4483 2018-11-28 18:25:21 I know right! With all his environmental BS and not allowing drilling of oil in the states or offshore, and has the audacity to claim its his doing is fooking batshit crazy. Trump made all this oil happen by tossing out all the dumb EPA shit.
4484 2018-11-28 18:25:08 There’s no way we were pumping out 11.1 million barrels of oil a day when you were in office you half wit... for your information Barry the US is now the number one oil producer in the world we just passed Russia...
4485 2018-11-28 18:25:04 I didn't order weed, I ordered CBD oil. Not did I add you to this. You must have liked or retweeted it, sorry
4486 2018-11-28 18:24:58 This ASSHOLE was killing the Industry. I work in it I know !!! We all hate him in the oil and gas industry. He was choking it out. GOD WHAT A LIAR  IN CHIEF.
4487 2018-11-28 18:24:58 We need a bridge from Alaska across the bearing into Russia. 
We could ship all the oil we wanted if we did that.
4488 2018-11-28 18:24:49 So Barack Insane NoBama claims the oil boom is his doing and so is the current economy. Who shut down the pipeline and restricted oil drilling in Alaska and limited new off shore leases? Who destroyed the health industry with Obama care? And whose GDP was in the sewer? Get real!
4489 2018-11-28 18:24:32 Oh Fuck I hope the guy that’s doing my oil change watches the office & doesn’t think I’m actually with Kevin
4490 2018-11-28 18:24:29 buying train cars to move oil that come in service in july makes 0 sense because thats when the car shortage is supposed to be alleviated already.  this doesn't help...
4491 2018-11-28 18:24:26 @SportsMT @SportsRV : In medieval times, sometimes as a punishment for criminals, they would batter their foot and dunk it in boiling oil. Is that a good sports radio story too?!
4492 2018-11-28 18:24:14 My intolerance won't kill me but it makes me feel really ill for about 10 days, like having flu. It took me 5 years to work it out.I thought I was seriously ill. I am intolerant of rapeseed oil, it's in everything. Ingredients lists are rare, only listed allergies are available.
4493 2018-11-28 18:24:14 Instead of spending billions on a pipeline, we could have spent on jobs in green technology. There could be jobs in forcing oil companies to hire people to clean up their mess.

Climate change is happening NOW, and intensifies inequality. Witness the private firefighters in CA.
4494 2018-11-28 18:24:12 I love using grapeseed oil in my hair, on my face, and all over my body really but like, if it could not make my cat suddenly think he’s Mickey Rourke In “9 1/2 Weeks”, that would be cool.
4495 2018-11-28 18:24:06 Ditto! I want her to just tell me what she uses in her hair to make it so sleek and shiny all the time 
@DLoesch? Castor oil? Relaxer? Egg whites? WHAT IS IT 
4496 2018-11-28 18:24:05 Closing shale oil fields in Utah did not do this #Odumba @WashTimes
4497 2018-11-28 18:23:51 Trump gets told likely will see oil prices lower soon. So he attacks the producers and takes the credit when it happens. 
He's done the same with the fed. He's been told they will ease off the pedal a bit. And he's going to take the credit for it too.
4498 2018-11-28 18:23:50 for comparison detached houses: Halifax $155 psf Charlottetown $196 psf Montreal $603 psf Toronto $903 psf Vancouver west side $1147 psf Calgary $365 (softening of oil) Winnipeg $282 psf Saskatoon $270 psf St. John's 137 psf #nlpoli we have all these natural resources... right?
4499 2018-11-28 18:23:46 Who's trynna kill a gram of oil today with me
4500 2018-11-28 18:23:41 Dow 470+
Naadaq 130+
Sgx 130+
S&P 2700 abv

Powell surprised the market by sounding dovish on his rate hike path. Equities zoomed and dollar sunk post the comment. With oil holding around $60 and dollar weakening, it is like India getting into a sweet spot
4501 2018-11-28 18:23:40 oil is hydrophobic so wont mix with water. oil floats to the top cuz its less dense than water. to make oil not hydrophobic u had to vote in the mid terms u fu-
4502 2018-11-28 18:23:33 My husband and I changed the oil in both our vehicles thanksgiving morning. The family that does auto maintenance together stays together. 
4503 2018-11-28 18:23:25 Evidence of that if u please. Frankly it’s completely nonsensical to say oil moved by rail & tranferred to tankers requires no extra safety procedures.
4504 2018-11-28 18:23:25 @LiciaCorbella it is too bad UR oil clueless&biased oil prices R controlled by the US to wit: US$problem is/was AB oil put their 'eggs' in 1 basket US instead of sharing with CANADIANS (we import 56% oil why??) shld have been resolved under Lougheed & Klein instead.........
4505 2018-11-28 18:23:24 App butter ki jaga cooking oil use kren us may cake kharab hone ka chance kam hota hai
4506 2018-11-28 18:23:15 I didn’t know they use palm oil. I wish they wouldn’t either. Makes me sad. 
4507 2018-11-28 18:22:58 Add some eucalyptus oil to that water for steamy head clearing results, too!
4508 2018-11-28 18:22:56 Thank the oil producers.
4509 2018-11-28 18:22:48 That snake oil salesman!! TB12 Method my eye!!!
4510 2018-11-28 18:22:34 When both benn and Seguin were left all alone out front in the last minute of the first was scary.  This team is still not good enough to score only one goal and expect to win.
4511 2018-11-28 18:22:30 Sorry. I'll tell J to look for jobs in Calgary. You have an oil industry, right?
4512 2018-11-28 18:22:28 like, here in this land, with the clouds and oil and stuff?
4513 2018-11-28 18:22:25 Had an appointment today for an oil change... on my way to the appointment my muffler fell and was dragging on the ground.
4514 2018-11-28 18:22:23 Oil na oil
If like buy palm oil and I buy engine oil
All join
4515 2018-11-28 18:22:16 Pass an electric mandate and let them drive their big electric trucks and feel American. Oil is the problem. Not people wanting to drive big masculine trucks. Just let it be.
4516 2018-11-28 18:22:10 Me: ugh these pancakes look like absolute shit... 
IHOP waitress: please ma’am, I am not allowed to serve you cardboard and motor oil
4517 2018-11-28 18:22:10 @BarackObama continued his Great Lie Tour yesterday @RiceUniversity claiming the Trump economy is his. He shut down coal,shut down oil, he made large on Solydra and other green energy frauds. His corruption is unsurpassed. IRS, Fat and Furious, and the phony Russia Investigation
4518 2018-11-28 18:22:09 SCHUMER: and a foot massage and a hot oil rub.

#fuckChuckSchumer
@TheDemocrats
4519 2018-11-28 18:21:58 So all the drilling moratoriums he imposed, increased US oil production? Huh 
4520 2018-11-28 18:21:57 According to BO it's because of him that America is the largest oil producer.... 
BO has taken credit for everything our Prez is doing & has done... what a POS.
4521 2018-11-28 18:21:57 *sigh.  My life - rats got in my house and ate the wiring for my dishwasher - $550 to replace, $200 to install. Took my car in for an oil change only to discover rats ate some of the wiring in my engine - $500 to repair.  #notahappycamper
4522 2018-11-28 18:21:56 Italy should leave the EU ASAP!
Vote in a Pro Business Administration and allow the Italian people to do what they know best. Produce products that everyone wants.  Clothing. Wine, Olives and Olive Oil and much much more!!!!’
4523 2018-11-28 18:21:55 Yes  am talking about this, but I saw them breaking that of main gate too
4524 2018-11-28 18:21:38 Are you supposed to? I beat the eggs before adding them to the milk and oil, but I don't beat the whites separately.
4525 2018-11-28 18:21:19 Yes, Holsum yi oil but it's better than cooking oil
4526 2018-11-28 18:21:16 He needs the votes so he can not kill the oil industry.  Difficult to balance.  If Trump-induced energy defaults occur, he is not gonna get re-elected.  #OOTT #Cl_F
4527 2018-11-28 18:21:08 Either he is lying about our oil production numbers being attributable to him.......
Or he is admitting he wasn't successful with his own agenda......
Or he is admitting that he was lying about his own agenda all along.
4528 2018-11-28 18:21:04 The Bible badgers don’t stab or shoot you, I can live with there morels, drugs and alcohol aren’t as prevalent as back home, for all I would like to see cbd oil available to sufferers.
4529 2018-11-28 18:21:04 I came to get an oil change & I pray they don’t try to talk me into anything else fr 
4530 2018-11-28 18:21:00 I live in a rural area, we have no public transit and heat with oil. Have invested in new furnace/windows/insulation, but I have to commute to work. My tax $ goes to support public transit in the GTA... this tax will apply across the board, businesses will be passing costs on...
4531 2018-11-28 18:20:51 How funny!  Our prices are always fair.  Come on down for your next oil change at All Tune and Lube.
4532 2018-11-28 18:20:50 what kind of snake oil shit is this hahahahahaha
4533 2018-11-28 18:20:47 Rail doesn't need to go through NEB process or court system, it already has permission to transport this oil, and much more if needed. No extra spill response needed, if BC wants to pay for more that's up to their provincial government.
4534 2018-11-28 18:20:43 Pancake and engine oil
4535 2018-11-28 18:20:41 Btw Doc, can I take fish oil supplement and like tumeric around same time? And what is best time to take these with food? And when a doctor says ‘with food’ or medication. What do they mean exactly? Very ambiguous.
4536 2018-11-28 18:20:39 @DuluthTradingCo do you sell any jeans that don’t fit like JNCO jeans from the 90s? Some of us are fat, but don’t have huge legs and don’t work on an oil rig
4537 2018-11-28 18:20:38 There are also coatings that could be applied that would prohibit the rust. They do this ALL the time on metal used on offshore oil rigs.
4538 2018-11-28 18:20:35 Simple as that. Do your best to help put Tesla, as well as companies building LFTR, the safe nuclear alternative, the lftr people from whom you have already accepted campaign monies, and from there they will sell LFTR to big oil for them to supplant dwindling oil reserves
4539 2018-11-28 18:20:29 How does that SOB have the nerve to take credit for the oil supply? He tried like hell to destroy our fuel resources.
4540 2018-11-28 18:20:08 won't this make it an offence to carry oil  with your moped. Does the law need an exception for things needed to drive said car
4541 2018-11-28 18:20:06 まーくんのお腹に包まれてすやぁしたいです…( ˘ω˘ ) ｽﾔｧ…
4542 2018-11-28 18:20:02 Chris Watts used his boot to step on his little girls heads to get them into those oil takes!!! Just think about that you Chris Watts lovers!!
4543 2018-11-28 18:20:02 Waiting is a bummer.  Next time you need an oil change, come on down to All Tune and Lube.  : )
4544 2018-11-28 18:20:01 You can take a slice of cucumber & let it sit for 25 minutes. You can mix a few drops of vitamin e oil into water. Dip a cotton pad and let it sit for 20 minutes. You can also moisten teabags in the refrigerator & let it sit for about 20 minutes. These help with bags
4545 2018-11-28 18:19:59 Any politician or laws on the books should be changed in order that pipelines can deliver oil to all parts of Canada… It should be a national emergency to get these pipelines built… It could be done in a year… But do we have the will…?
4546 2018-11-28 18:19:54 Not a fan of butter in your coffee with MCT oil?  
4547 2018-11-28 18:19:46 Hard to believe, but Obama told his biggest lie ever! Obama just said he’s responsible for current Oil Boom, even though he  blocked pipelines, offshore drilling and went all in on Wind Mills! Obama is totally Pathetic! #tcot #ccot
4548 2018-11-28 18:19:45 Hola Nicolás. Yo me acuerdo de tí cuando andabas en franela del MVR, como un wachi, y disparabas contra los manifestantes. Eras un mono y aunque ahora comas carne lo seguirás siendo hasta que mueras como un perro. No vengas a México que no eres bienvenido.
4549 2018-11-28 18:19:41 Me: Essential oils are bs. Depression needs medicine. 
Also me: Diffuses lavender essential oil like my life depends on it and ironically it does.
4550 2018-11-28 18:19:29 He doesn't remember he STOPPED keystone, drilling off shore and any oil production in Alaska!  so, how the hell did he get this going?
4551 2018-11-28 18:19:28 Damn does it rlly take this long for an oil change 
4552 2018-11-28 18:19:28 Obama wants credit for oil boom in America, right!  Pres Trump had to reverse about everything you did.  Just think if Hillary would have won you would be blaming dismal oil outlook on Bush! Obama was a talker being president was out of his league. Make America great again #1
4553 2018-11-28 18:19:27 Obama had about as much to do with increased oil production as I did. He banned drilling offshore & on Federal lands, stalled the Keystone pipeline and he was against fracking! Obama once said we would never see two dollar gas. He was wrong once again!
4554 2018-11-28 18:19:25 That why I questioned it. I read something three or four weeks ago they said fish oil does nothing for the heart.
4555 2018-11-28 18:19:25 I thought he was against fossil fuels and is a big believer in climate change. Now all of a sudden he is the reason we are producing oil? Wouldn’t that make him part of the so called problem? I need a beer! 
4556 2018-11-28 18:19:19 This one and sun 5&6
Come is it only in your house that there is sun and please stop wasting our crude oil
4557 2018-11-28 18:19:17 He could his Presidential library accomplishments in an oil can.
4558 2018-11-28 18:19:16 The oil boom has much more to do with the advances in fracking technology resulting in increasing efficiencies more than any president.
4559 2018-11-28 18:19:15 OIL SHEE N
4560 2018-11-28 18:19:06 Mr. Keeley believed that Trump is a miracle worker. He bears some responsibility for being conned. But so are others: Russians peddled snake oil; Trump made reckless claims. But let's not forget elected representatives of both parties who could have said that no president... /1
4561 2018-11-28 18:19:06 Say THE SMUGMASTER. Some hubris n nerve taking credit for economy and major oil production. He failed miserably.  He really is mentally ILL
4562 2018-11-28 18:19:04 Yea...Obama claiming HE is reason oil and gas is doing well-in Houston no less-No one ever said he was smart
4563 2018-11-28 18:19:00 Obama is dreaming!  It’s amazing we were able to produce oil despite all of his regulations and restrictions!!  What a jerk!

4566 2018-11-28 18:18:36 Don’t place all burden on government...
Big oil and a host of others are in this game too...and they can play around for a loooonnng time.
4567 2018-11-28 18:18:35 I'm bout to get sexy on you mutts today and get a oil change.... Don't y'all hit me up tryna get no ride....talking bout how sexy you thought I was lol
4568 2018-11-28 18:18:35 Nothing special.
Ingredients: WHOLE GRAIN BLEND (OATS, RYE), ENRICHED FLOUR [WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, REDUCED IRON, VITAMIN B1, B2, FOLIC ACID], CANOLA OIL, WHOLE GRAIN WHEAT FLOUR, SUGAR, BROWN SUGAR, MALT SYRUP (FROM CORN, BARLEY), INVERT SUGAR, BAKING SODA, SALT, SOY LECITHIN...
4569 2018-11-28 18:18:31 But it Sounds like you were scared your taxes were gonna go up, so those oil companies really did a great job misinforming people
4570 2018-11-28 18:18:31 Check what democrat Obama's liberal equivalent to the north has done to Canada's oil and gas sector, the driver of Canada's economy.
4571 2018-11-28 18:18:30 Happenstance, President Obama entered office just as the #shale #oil boom was getting started. However increased production occurred on private land. True, he was in office over this noted expansion of oil/gas production; but as they used to say, “there’s more to the story”
4572 2018-11-28 18:18:23 Put this hair growth oil in my hair & my scalp feel like heaven
4573 2018-11-28 18:18:09 @MarcJGian is the best essential oil practitioner around
4574 2018-11-28 18:18:07 WHAT? He removed the Atlantic from the next 5 yr offshore energy plan B4 leaving ofc. banning drilling across Atl from the CA border to VA, then rejected applications to conduct testing off the coasts of VA, NC, SC, GA & FL, ending attempts to search for oil and gasThank Trump!
4575 2018-11-28 18:18:06 I wonder how long it's going to take before the oil industry is held accountable in the same way that the tobacco industry was?
4576 2018-11-28 18:17:58 America needs to boost #renewable energy ventures (like electric cars) & wean itself from dirty coal, oil, and gas. (Instead of deregulating polluters, regulate them & impose a serious carbon tax.) Our planet is at stake. The U.S. should be leading the world. #ParisAgreement
4577 2018-11-28 18:17:56 With no more interest rate hike and the 20% oil tax cut this economic cycle can continue for the next 5 year pump by a super tech cycle lead by amazing new technologie #AI #cloud #5g #IOT #AV #EV #bigdata

4581 2018-11-28 18:17:38 - Put Jojoba oil on your nails daily to keep them healthy

- Don’t try and grow them using salt and water like people say to...trust me it doesn’t work. Water makes your nails more weak

- Nail polish also acts as an extra layer of protection and keeps good oil in your nail
4582 2018-11-28 18:17:30 One more person says the syrup is motor oil and twitter is cancelled. WE ALL SAW THE VIDEO CLOWNS
4583 2018-11-28 18:17:26 Perfect together. Like oil and water

4585 2018-11-28 18:17:16 Engineer! I've been there recently, this might be north gate but there is also something similar at the main gate
4586 2018-11-28 18:17:16 It is worth noting; that @saudiarabia IS a #dictatorship. Has been so since it came to existence in 1990s. If not #MBS, it will all go quiet, then there will be someone like him. History!!
Any relationship with this dreadful regime, is just about #Oil and money. Nothing else!
4587 2018-11-28 18:17:08 Much credit is due @tommydidario for his very rare honesty in revealing his transitioning from veganism back to a basically Mediterranean, fish-based diet.  That said, I would like to hear more about what kind of fish and brand of extra virgin olive oil he uses in this new diet.
4588 2018-11-28 18:17:07 Again, that is fine that y’all are against renewables and want to end their subsidies and not those or oil/gas/manufacturing.  It is clear by your actions this is the case

Just don’t try to stand on “principle” saying you are against all subsidies when you are only attacking one
4589 2018-11-28 18:17:07 Before you engage in campaigns on social media and off, learn to investigate its motives thoroughly before you end up being used.

4594 2018-11-28 18:16:50 I'd make a fantastic pet then, can't cook for shit! Can change the oil and filter on a car though!
4595 2018-11-28 18:16:38 Simpleeeeee just askkkkkkk and stop drilling as if you’re looking for oil
4596 2018-11-28 18:16:35 Obama, raising hand and waving it vigorously, "I'm the one who increased oil production! It was me! It was ME! IT WAS ME!"

I thought he blocked fossil fuel production and transportation at every opportunity? Is he taking credit for some kind of "rebound" strategy or something?
4597 2018-11-28 18:16:32 @EricLiptonNYT ..Many thanks for your article on leading federal land purchases/speculation by oil and gas drillers....these stunning details need to be promulgated prior to the 2020 election and actively distributed to every voter in the interim

4603 2018-11-28 18:15:57 He is so full of himself. If Hillary was President we would not be largest producer of oil. Thank you Trump 
4604 2018-11-28 18:15:54 It looks like a heavily aged oil painting.
4605 2018-11-28 18:15:54 Ima need y’all to realize and remember that oils are SEALANTS not MOISTURIZERS. I cringe when I see ppl applying oils to their hair with no prior moisturizer. Girl at least spray ur hair with some water before u add that oil . Please!!!
4606 2018-11-28 18:15:51 stone is still the preferred building material problem is most of us can't afford it However protesters still use them in the middle east Crushed stone is used alot for drainage Oil will be used as a paving material for a long time yet

4612 2018-11-28 18:15:17 Tom #science is real, so is #climatechange. Try being on the right side of history and lay-off the Oil and Gas donations. Prove you aren’t for sale. #GOP #mars
4613 2018-11-28 18:15:09 I love to hear a pissed-off #RushLimbaugh.  Barack Obama taking credit for growing economy (specifically unprecedented oil production) IS infuriating.
4614 2018-11-28 18:15:08 i dipped a pretzel in oil paint for the meme and almost accidentally ate it. life comes at you fast.
4615 2018-11-28 18:15:05 Obama is a liar, he did nothing but impede oil exploration and production !
4616 2018-11-28 18:15:02 本望だよ…
4617 2018-11-28 18:14:57 So you can be an American nationalist and not attack other countries, set up military bases, or expect them to supply you with oil/other resources. Sounds good to me.
4618 2018-11-28 18:14:54 I'm not exactly sure this is the case for the mince pies but it is in many other of their products they've removed palm oil from!
4619 2018-11-28 18:14:44 And a great one. We love our trucks, we love our horses & livestock and we love our oil!
4620 2018-11-28 18:14:43 Lol ehn nau, what do u expect me to say? She's a customer of frizllers or KIL
4621 2018-11-28 18:14:41 
What’s more astonishing is the people who are applauding him saying that he increased oil production, are probably the same people that were booing President Trump when he said he wants to increase oil production 
4622 2018-11-28 18:14:40 Confrontation sum I don't avoid, I'm just slicker den niggas like olive oil.
4623 2018-11-28 18:14:38 Baahaaaa,  Mr solar and wind Obama, trying to take credit the oil boom!!  Typical dimm.
4624 2018-11-28 18:14:33 Come visit I got lots
4625 2018-11-28 18:14:33 USA remains to keep a blind eye on Saudi Arabia despite its own CIA report because that would a be a big blow to the oil imports and trade between the two. USA would also cease to be a big player in the Middle East as they would lose their biggest ally in the region.
4626 2018-11-28 18:14:33 we used to make motor bikes that made a sound using 5litre tins of cooking oil and a string stretching to a covered container. it was heaven then!!!
4627 2018-11-28 18:14:32 Nope, you're not missing a thing.

4631 2018-11-28 18:14:14 yall i’m getting my oil changed idk wtf is going on
4632 2018-11-28 18:14:09 Rush is going nuts, upset at Obama now taking credit for our oil success after he stopped pipelines.

(got rid of gulf oil rigs, stopped any drilling on public lands and did everything he could to hurt oil production)

(It is maddening)
4633 2018-11-28 18:14:07 Well oil of slipperiness is already a thing, this is just one step further
4634 2018-11-28 18:14:06 @BarackObama going around lying saying he gets credit for the oil boom, when he stopped all drilling, put companies out of business, many jobs lost!  This guy was in so many scandals against America and you pussies @HouseGOP @SenateGOP did nothing!
4635 2018-11-28 18:13:59 According to Mexican interior minister Mexico is too dangerous for them. When pointed out, if this is really true, 130 million Mexicans may qualify for asylum as well. 
He stammers and crab walks this absurd claim.
4636 2018-11-28 18:13:58 @PeterLBrandt for the record Peter, I bought the NASDAQ and some tech shares as a result oil your tweet. so HUGE thank you from me!
4637 2018-11-28 18:13:55 Jezuz...and when @RachelNotley gets turfed in May, she'll go right back to trying to shut down the Oil business..
4638 2018-11-28 18:13:53 Let's see if we cut our oil and electrical supply to the USA and see how irrelevant we really are.

4647 2018-11-28 18:13:03 Also... I bet he doesn’t provide bath oil in his establishment. Ridiculous expectations in other people’s establishments. Hypocritical!
4648 2018-11-28 18:12:53 Obama continues to try to take credit for Trump's amazing accomplishments. We've heard him try to take credit for the economy, but now he was at Rice University trying to take credit for the current oil boom? Lol. A Democrat responsible for an oil boom? That's a laugh. Pathetic

4652 2018-11-28 18:12:39 The Alberta government is entering negotiations to purchase rail cars to ship more oil. Hope to add 120k bpd of capacity by August 2020. #ableg
4653 2018-11-28 18:12:37 Ameenn sir
4654 2018-11-28 18:12:35 Daaaaamn. Yeah, that’s no good. It’s such a delicate balance. I also take Neurontin and Klonopin, and I can take CBD oil instead of Klonopin during the day (it keeps me wide the fuck awake. WEED keeps me awake. WHAT THE FUCK.) If one thing doesn’t work, none do.
4655 2018-11-28 18:12:18 Oil should be $200 a barrel and steak should cost $40 a pound.
4656 2018-11-28 18:12:16 Because they've replaced palm oil with animal fats and butter
4657 2018-11-28 18:12:12 @RachelNotley Bill C-69 needs to be fixed, C-48 needs to be fixed and Feds need to join #Alberta in buying rail cars to ship 120K barrels/day of oil. Would increase shipments by 1/3, narrow oil price gap by $4, + $1M/day to fed coffers and increase royalty rev. #cdnclubottawa 
4658 2018-11-28 18:12:12 I will send my thanks to the planet Mars because it had as much to do with the oil boom as that crackpot Obama did #WorstPresidentEver
4659 2018-11-28 18:12:11 He said your Mates are buying Baby oil you dey buy beard oil like ah
this one too be case? ei
4660 2018-11-28 18:12:06 He should be saying in spite of me America is the largest oil producer. Thanks Obama 
4661 2018-11-28 18:12:00 Love the coloration on the text box, a nice petroleum sheen. So long as a single drop of the Oil remains, the joyous work continues.
4662 2018-11-28 18:11:57 He's completely against oil, he's a globalist who was - and still is - determined to shut down oil and other fuel usage.  He has clearly stated it.  What a member this guy is.
4663 2018-11-28 18:11:52 He is still can't tell the truth. He did everything he could to stop the oil production.
4664 2018-11-28 18:11:45 Yea what about the murderous regime of Saudi Arabia where are the sanctions for them we dont need them they need us anyone who believes otherwise is woefully uninformed we produce more oil than they do are weapons systems are the most advanced weapons they but from us
4665 2018-11-28 18:11:45 He hated oil and gas and tried turn America in third world country. He hates America and said as he toured Apology of America
4666 2018-11-28 18:11:43 Premier @RachelNotley "I am here to tell you today that Alberta will buy the rail cars ourselves to move this oil.
And we’re not wasting any time."
Expect the conclusion of the deal. within weeks. #cdnpoli #AbLeg #hw #abpoli
4667 2018-11-28 18:11:43 that definitely has a better ring to it compared to how actually did it, which was prying off a lid of an oil can irresponsibly
4668 2018-11-28 18:11:42 Special thanks to SPX, BTC, ETH and XAU for making me green for this month. OIL can go f* itself, lol
4669 2018-11-28 18:11:41 Requirement to buy oil in 55gn drum ($302/unit) severe impediment to heat security in Black Tickle, where majority earn <$29k/yr. Previously, locals could by fuel by the can (20 litres), on as needed basis. Returning fuel storage would immediately improve access. #NCCResearch
4670 2018-11-28 18:11:39 You have a long way to go to prove there's a better price for tar sands bitumen.  Also, when has a politician in this country ever gained by not worshipping the oil industry?

4686 2018-11-28 18:10:41 Oil, acrylic or watercolor before. It was an interesting yet frustrating experience. I want to practice more at home, but I don't have time lately :/ hopefully I will have some during the uni break. I find traditional paintings beautiful and I'd love to master some techniques
4687 2018-11-28 18:10:39 OMG! He  is so self-centered he doesn't even know how far out of bounds his comment is. He faught any expansion of gas and oil production during his administration. Unfortunately, for him, the Bakken formation in the Williston Basin was not something he was able to stop.
4688 2018-11-28 18:10:35 Dat baby oil b having me smell and feel so good 
4689 2018-11-28 18:10:35 Btw, it' isn't the US that is the largest oil producer...it's just...Texas.

#oott
4691 2018-11-28 18:10:25 That’s what happens when you put your faith in a snake oil salesman #TheJooxIsReal
4692 2018-11-28 18:10:22 I’m in the energy sector as well and studied ag engineering. Seeds are not the same as oil. It takes a business week to test for soybean germination.
4693 2018-11-28 18:10:21 oil to 20? 
4694 2018-11-28 18:10:20 Says the snake oil salesman who peddled many a fallacy to con the electorate. You will never be PM Boris and at the next GE I sincerely hope you lose your seat and disappear into irrelevance for eternity
4695 2018-11-28 18:10:20 見回り行ってきまーす！
4696 2018-11-28 18:10:16 Bulls$&t! That was private land owners producing oil.
4697 2018-11-28 18:10:14 “There was no bath oil!” You’re not in the fucking Mandarin Oriental mate. #fourinabed
4698 2018-11-28 18:10:12 If UK does not pay anything it just says you cannot trust any commitments made now or in future. Canada + not on offer without paying and has severe limitations. WTO a busted flush or why would we want FTAs? Clean is a snake oil sales pitch- reality far from clean
4699 2018-11-28 18:10:12 @AliVelshi Contrary to your reporting moments ago. Yemen do have crude oil. While output may not be at par with other oil producing countries, it may not necessarily reflect on her deposits.
4700 2018-11-28 18:10:09 Beard oil is tight but it’s exhausting to do all the time, feels like it stays on my hands the whole day after a wash
4701 2018-11-28 18:10:08 Carbon neutral and no freedom. That’s your model. Dont they get all the oil they need from ? Who are big coal consumers? State-dominated economies in China, India.
4702 2018-11-28 18:10:06 So before leaving office he signed executive orders that would put a block on @realDonaldTrump to carry out oil and gas excavation, and now Obama thinks he's JD Rockefeller

4704 2018-11-28 18:10:01 The fact that it's going into December and we're still talking about the Browns and a possible late-season run for an improbable wildcard shows to the progress that the organization is making, but also shows that Hue Jackson is one of the biggest snake oil salesman in sports

4708 2018-11-28 18:09:50 I am super done w/ the self important sneering Ethical Oil propaganda coming out of the oil patch
The East imports oil because it is a commodity on the world market & long ago it was decided that the cost of transportation was prohibitive for AB oil compared to Shipping #cdnpoli
4709 2018-11-28 18:09:47 How sad is your life that you spend your days looking for video to deliberately miss interpret to sell more snake oil to your fans
4710 2018-11-28 18:09:41 Not idealistic and unrealistic at all, Alan.

Rather, it is simply a fact: human life is worth much more than oil.
4711 2018-11-28 18:09:40 Oil-by-rail where upgraded & value added petroleum is shipped after it's refined by Alberta workers, or "Build my pipeline or I crash train cars of toxic bitumen all over BC!!'  oil-by-rail? #bcpoli #canpoli
4712 2018-11-28 18:09:39 The government is owned by oil.
If anything you fuck them over more right now by owning an electric. You know power prices would go sky high if nobody bought gasoline.

They have us either way. But right now, less through electricity.
4713 2018-11-28 18:09:33 So do people want oil field jobs or do they just want jobs? Because if you require a job in oil, then I have terrible news for you.
4714 2018-11-28 18:09:26 Please check what they are talking about. Heavy oil doesn’t just come to the surface like sweet oil.
4715 2018-11-28 18:09:24 I realized it's at North gate

What a petulant little turd.

4722 2018-11-28 18:08:44 This guy was against fossil fuels all during his presidency. Now he is claiming credit for higher oil production. Amazing.

The report from diverse scientific perspectives all reported its man made cause by burning OIL,

4728 2018-11-28 18:07:51 National Steel Car in Hamilton and CP rail will build the cars for crude oil. Keeping jobs in Canada and Ontario.
4729 2018-11-28 18:07:50 First, they aren't refugees. They are country shoppers. 
Second, lefties always frame things in absolutes. If the 1st person in the four country area has the RIGHT to come,40 millionth one also. The 200 millionth person from wherever has the same right?
4730 2018-11-28 18:07:34 The Saudis purchasing 900 billion in weapons, being the world's largest oil producer and allying with Israel against Iran are all credible reasons why they are choosing to stick with them, but you don't to be disingenuous about what transpired
4731 2018-11-28 18:07:29 Somewhere jimmy carter is mumbling ,all I had to do was tell Saudis to lower oil prices
4732 2018-11-28 18:07:07 Alberta Premier @RachelNotley just announced her government is in the process of buying 2 new unit trains trains to move oil out of the province in light of massive WCS/WTI differential. #oott #oilsands
4733 2018-11-28 18:07:04 Premier Notley says “ I am here to tell you today that Alberta will buy the rail cars ourselves to move this oil.”
4734 2018-11-28 18:07:01 Liberal scientists?!?!   How about ALL scientists except those funded by oil companies to spew anti-science and baseless claims.
4735 2018-11-28 18:06:52 Most people don't know this but many health insurance providers will give you a discount on your coverage if you vape CBD oil, you just have to send them a video of you blowing a fat cloud as proof.
4736 2018-11-28 18:06:51 Acrylic mostly because I don't have the patience for oil
4737 2018-11-28 18:06:46 Crude oil is now cheap - energy stocks are very cheap - tax loss selling has less than 2 weeks left.
4738 2018-11-28 18:06:46 It is not a duty sir. 

Happiness in marriage is the oil that makes the wheel move.
4739 2018-11-28 18:06:44 @realDonaldTrump Mr President,  what are your thoughts about Obama taking credit for the US oil production?
4740 2018-11-28 18:06:41 I need to go get an oil change and stop playing
4741 2018-11-28 18:06:38 Man it is cold outside and normally i would be curled up all stiff from the ol' bones not liking this weather...Not today!! I love how this oil helps me!!

4742 2018-11-28 18:06:37 A guy in the stream room at the gym I go to just told me that sometimes he lies to wife and tells her he’s going to workout but instead drives his car around the canyons and listens to music and then sprays oil on his face before getting home to fake the appearance of sweat.
4743 2018-11-28 18:06:30 As far as I’m concerned, a carbon tax is nothing but a money grab.  Much like excessive taxes on cigarettes, it does not deter use, and is not needed to pay for treatment. I’m all for green technology, demand in the free market will excel when oil is scarce.  No need to overtax.
4744 2018-11-28 18:06:29 A bottom is forming for crude oil and once the speculative hedge fund holdings have been fully liquidated we will have all the ingredients in place for a strong recovery once we start to see the normal stronger winter demand which will be with us shortly.
4745 2018-11-28 18:06:29 @this_vid
4746 2018-11-28 18:06:26 So much oil under that pitch
4747 2018-11-28 18:06:24 he said I must use it instead of cooking oil

4752 2018-11-28 18:06:02 You've sparked an interesting debate among the national accountants! Effect on GDP is unclear: might be fall for oil and gas output, but increase for waste management. Could be neutral overall, but depends on how it is done.

4759 2018-11-28 18:05:21 In 2011 Ghana’s economy was the fastest growing the world. Boosted by oil production we grew by 14%, yet the number of jobs created is still not known.

4768 2018-11-28 18:04:44 Oil prices have reduced significantly since the same months of the last fiscal year. Moreover, import of capital goods under the cpec have been reduced in comparison with the previous year as various projects such as Lahore orange line have slowed/shut down altogether.

4781 2018-11-28 18:04:07 Slicker than castor oil
4782 2018-11-28 18:04:01 I think it will be a long while before green roofs become more expensive. Basically, not till oil prices reach $150-200/barrel. But, that doesn’t matter. All the benefits, either societally or individually, of a green roof outweigh the costs.
4783 2018-11-28 18:03:58 In 2011 Ghana’s economy was the fastest growing the world. Boosted by oil production we grew by 14%, yet the number of jobs created is still not known.

4785 2018-11-28 18:03:51 Notley repeats that the toll of plunging oil prices is mounting, creating anxiety and uncertainty, and it’s costing the Canadian economy $80 million a day. She says Alberta is prepared to act, Ottawa must do more too.
4786 2018-11-28 18:03:44 Youve got to be fucking kidding me!!??!!??   He did everything he could to stop our production of oil!  WTF!  He is literally insane!
4787 2018-11-28 18:03:42 At best, he strategically ignored domestic fracking because without it the economy would have been even worse during his presidency. Also necessary because of his laughable foreign policy. Had he been a vocal supporter of domestic production he would have never been nominated
4788 2018-11-28 18:03:32 Talk of surplus when there is no fuel,no cooking oil,no money in the bank,high cost living..munopenga.. @MthuliNcube can yu go back to being a lecturer pliz..takukutuma manje

4790 2018-11-28 18:03:24 This is the guy that cancelled construction of the Keystone oil pipeline?
4791 2018-11-28 18:03:24 Don’t count on it Jerry.  Look at the complete lack of support he gave the oil industry. He’s as phoney as a three dollar bill.
4792 2018-11-28 18:03:24 No, we were put the oil in storage for a rainy day AND promoting a manner of renewables. Now, Trump just wants to drill all willy nilly and say FU to solar and such.
4793 2018-11-28 18:03:21 Why is nobody in parliament asking any questions about developing our DOMESTIC oil industry? The current economic climate regarding worldwide oil prices is detrimental to Canadian oil production and supply!Refineries should be built now!Self sufficiency is always the best policy

These are Trumps allies, whom he is selling nukes & arms

The Mediterranean diet--especially olive oil--has been proven in countless studies to be heart-healthy. What are you one of those angry vegans or something?!

He’s sold us out 4Russian loans &pee tapes/Saudi oil &$$/&the oozing praise of any1. We’re expected 2just accept that.
4801 2018-11-28 18:02:53 Premier @RachelNotley "The oil we
produce in Canada, was back around $10 dollars, because we can’t get it out to market.
Coca-Cola sells sugar-flavored water for more.
We are essentially giving our oil away for free." #cdnpoli #abpoli #ABleg
4802 2018-11-28 18:02:52 That oil is not recoverable and cannot be counted as reserves. Teapot Dome was the center for enhanced oil recovery technology development. If it is not being produced (at 200 barrels a day), it will not be produced.

Think of ketchup left as you throw the bottle away.

4805 2018-11-28 18:02:46 The socialistesque reforms are now mostly rolled back. Not breaking with Capitalism affected them massively when oil prices crashed. They still have an elite and capitalist interests in the country. The situation is complex but it wasn't a case of spending all the money...
4806 2018-11-28 18:02:45 But you are happy about the bafoon in office right now who is f**** the planet over for $ from oil&coal industri, and firing tear gas at woman and children? Hypocrite!
4807 2018-11-28 18:02:45 I hate how these mainstream companies sell coconut oil to us for so much 
4808 2018-11-28 18:02:39 This can be a problem if someone washes their hair, throw oil on it, it’s still wet at the appointment, and didn’t stretch their hair( blow dry or twist). It’s a hot mess. You won’t believe how many do that. Braider =/= licensed cosmetologist.

4820 2018-11-28 18:01:50 WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM REALIZE THEIR #STUPIDITY TO KILL SOMEBODY LIKE THIS IN 21st #CENTURY,BUT THEY WERE VERY #FAITHFUL TO #AMERICA FOR THE OIL WE FOUND FOR THEM IN #SaudiArabia. BUT THEY MUST DO SOMETHING FOR #Kashoggi FAMILY & ALSO FOR #Journalists AS A WHOLE.
4821 2018-11-28 18:01:49 Alberta is one of the least-taxed jurisdictions in the western world. If there has been a shortfall it has nothing to do with the NDP, it is due to the oil price crisis which preceded the NDP.
4822 2018-11-28 18:01:46 Obama hated oil and coal, he did nothing but bash both industries when he was pushing his green energy agenda.
4823 2018-11-28 18:01:32 "Eat olive oil and massage yourselves with it, for it comes from a blessed tree." - Prophet Muhammad pbuh#Hadith [Ahmad & Tirmidhi]
4824 2018-11-28 18:01:31 And wot abart the oil matey?
4825 2018-11-28 18:01:28 Stop using palm oil.
4826 2018-11-28 18:01:26 #doe inventory data bearish. #Crude +3.58mm (+2.53mm exp) - 10th weekly build in a row #Distillates +2.61mm but demand week on week very bad for distillates at 3.5 vs 4.2...finally slow demand kicking in #oil. #oott

4828 2018-11-28 18:01:22 & let's not forget that Carney "printed" £190bn to avoid that predicted recession.

About 20yrs worth of EU budget contributions printed because a bunch of snake oil salesmen lied through their teeth.
4829 2018-11-28 18:01:22 The US is the largest producer of oil and Petroleum-  why do we need their oil?
4830 2018-11-28 18:01:17 Our feet are often neglected but they deserve Healthy treat. My Feet #SecretSpaTherapy is making Mix of equal quantities of oatmeal, corn meal, sea salt, olive oil, aloe vera with peppermint oil then apply to feet & massage. @meghadhanesh @Mercy_ness @love_arcu #MyPlanetSpa #Avon
4831 2018-11-28 18:01:17 Anyone that brings his Free Deji stuff on my TL am honestly blocking you, I don't care who you are.
Nobody I repeat Nobody will be watched trying to flame up this country with their fake news, hate speech and sowing seed of discord and hatred amongst Nigerians.
4832 2018-11-28 18:01:11 Lemon oil can help with that.
4833 2018-11-28 18:01:07 But no extra rail capacity to export it because without new pipelines and Trudeau cancelling Northern Gateway (previously approved under Harper), oil is dangerously and inefficiently diverted to rail and taking away capacity meant for farmers.
4834 2018-11-28 18:00:55 hmm, I'll have to read the NP piece but if it is saying climate activism has impacted AB oil production (or is behind long ago decision to import oil for eastern half of the country) I'll have to hard disagree o_0
4835 2018-11-28 18:00:51 DNSHSJDJ yes ill asked mermaid, poseidon, fish and aqua man to stream wiom, i work there to  produce oil or gas.
4836 2018-11-28 18:00:50 Didn’t know obama can use his wand to produce oil. He should wave his wand to fix his ugly floppy rat ears too.
4837 2018-11-28 18:00:46 Ah, no worries :) not surprised boise looks like an oil refinery tbh
4838 2018-11-28 18:00:45 A fear of a slowdown in the global demand for oil has lead to a price decline in crude oil
4839 2018-11-28 18:00:45 That was the oil producers doing an end run around the 0bama EPA once it became obvious he was never going to allow them to get oil from federally controlled lands. That was and is in spite of Hussein's policies.
4840 2018-11-28 18:00:36 He was in Houston last night speaking at Rice. So glad I wasn’t there! Yes he pushed for green energy, not oil and gas.

4843 2018-11-28 18:00:27 Obama shut down out oil and coal and sold our wind energy contracts  to china to make all our needed parts....made in China assembled in America by illegals. that's the Obama way.
4844 2018-11-28 18:00:26 I like my coffee to taste like motor oil....
4845 2018-11-28 18:00:22 Agree Bel, let there be oil.    
Shareholders deserve reward for what they've been through in what should've been a straightforward drill.
4846 2018-11-28 18:00:22 I need to do an oil change on chucks car since im gonna be driving it but funds are still negative.

4850 2018-11-28 17:59:45 It’s when idiots say things like “People voted for something completely different” I get really fucking riled. No, you voted for the UK to leave the EU. You were sold snake oil, and called those of us who saw behind the curtain “remoaners”, “snowflakes”, “project fear”. #RantOver
4851 2018-11-28 17:59:37 Well. You're officially part of the problem. Let history note that @Heritage is a climate change denier and supporter of big oil, to the detriment of the human race and all life on earth.
4852 2018-11-28 17:59:34 True . Islam wants another cash flow other than oil because the demand will eventually disappear. What better way to make money off almost every person on earth by certifying the entire  food supply and every consumable they can lay their hands on .
4853 2018-11-28 17:59:32 What was the name of the oil company that had the dog killed by a worker on LI?
4854 2018-11-28 17:59:29 See what happened to oil when the Fed blinked in late 2007.
4855 2018-11-28 17:59:24 Obama also scheduled for lease every unleased square mile of the Central Gulf of Mexico - which produces a high majority of US offshore oil & gas.

Central GoM is offshore Louisiana, Mississippi & Alabama.
4856 2018-11-28 17:59:19 Obama's oil policies strangled oil and gas industry.  It was almost like he WANTED us to be dependent on the Middle East...
4857 2018-11-28 17:59:14 60 sec cleansing followed by toning, serums, moisturizer, and any oil if you need it. A la @LaBeautyologist method.
4858 2018-11-28 17:59:10 My oil and gas light turned on at the same time, I’m definitely cursed and broke
4859 2018-11-28 17:59:09 Because our retarded feral government regulates every aspect of daily life making in damn near impossible to mine ore, build a new smelter, drill for oil, etc. without paying billions of dollars in lawyer's, environmental, and permit fees. The government is BROKEN.
4860 2018-11-28 17:59:05 R* . Federal Reserve  . Loaded The Boat . @ 0% . Bonds Bought by Oil Companies Hedge Against Oil Price$ Falling $110-$30 (2012) . Oil went to $75 . Global Inflation Grew . Seasonal Winter Oil Took Inflation & Bonds (CCC) w/ it Down .

= Seasonal Global Inflation (2019) @tomkeene
4861 2018-11-28 17:59:03 There he goes .... selling the American people "Miracle Snake Oil" .... wake up folks. This man is a nut case that just lied in your face about not allowing your plants to shut down!! He is clueless and doesn't care about the working class because he has never been a part of it.
4862 2018-11-28 17:58:58 see da cup in the background? old burnt engine oil
4863 2018-11-28 17:58:57 Yep and the #POTUS has said more than enough, just send that retribution in the form of lower oil prices. #Weknowwhatyoudidlastsummer and  b4 that. #SavingFace
4864 2018-11-28 17:58:55 Notley: Just yesterday, West Texas Intermediate Crude was trading at $52 dollars.
Brent Crude was trading $61 dollars. And Western Canadian Select, the oil we
produce in Canada, was back around $10 dollars.

4867 2018-11-28 17:58:49 Cruid oil Kitna hai 70per barl JB upa ke time  110 per barrel tha tb bhi yhi rate tha kyo itni loot kyon
4868 2018-11-28 17:58:47 @GM IS GOING BROKE because under #Obama gas prices were high & we were still dependent on foreign oil. #GM decided to produce more small cars like the #Cobalt & now they can’t sell them because people want SUV’S in this booming economy! #CNN #MSNBC @CNBC #TCOT
4869 2018-11-28 17:58:40 Oil prices being too low is the seed corn of the next oil shock.
4870 2018-11-28 17:58:39 Exactly.What he’s getting at is as the wood sap crystalizes over time@ diff rates that can b due to different colors requiring different materials to make them. Maybe the lotus root in Blue pigment #57 shows better preserving abilities compared to goldfish liver oil in Aztec Gold

Please help your sister and retweet 

My Customers might be on your timeline
4873 2018-11-28 17:58:34 he stepped up to the plate of big macs while selling them snake oil, they bought it and he's on to the next big con...
4874 2018-11-28 17:58:27 Here’s an idea.. Oshawa can demolish the old GM plant & build a refinery. Then we can use rail to get AB to Oshawa & start process on a pipeline. It could supply AB oil to GTA, Montreal, etc reducing imported oil. No opposition to pipe from SK, MB or ON now. Who’s on board?
4875 2018-11-28 17:58:20 Saaaaammmmeee! Tbh I’m terrified of cooking oil. I don’t fuck with it. Air frying maybe...but not messing with 350-400 degree splattering oil
4876 2018-11-28 17:58:13 We can add scented oil?
4877 2018-11-28 17:58:12 OR fry 'em in coconut oil and let 'em soak up the coconutty goodness
4878 2018-11-28 17:58:03 やった…！永眠しちゃうね…（尊死）
4879 2018-11-28 17:57:58 While oil leases were increased on certain lands under Obama, public lease lands were reduced for production.
4880 2018-11-28 17:57:54 we still buy oil. So first order of business don't buy anymore oil from the Saudis
4881 2018-11-28 17:57:46 Despite Obama and his draconian regulations Americans fracked their way to global oil dominance.
4882 2018-11-28 17:57:44 Spinach, ham, and egg (avacodo oil) breakfast hit the mufuggin spot.

4887 2018-11-28 17:57:04 Sativa cannabis oil
4888 2018-11-28 17:57:04 There's only one major political party in the world (R) denying climate change. The argument that "big environment" promotes and pays for anthropogenic climate change science just to blame the poor, innocent, sacred big oil/coal/auto industries which need protection is a stretch.
4889 2018-11-28 17:57:01 Glad for you, Shirley. Great that you realized that for yourself. I have fibromyalgia and often go through very painful days. Am getting relief from CBD oil which is non addictive and has no psychoactive effects. Very seldom need prescription meds for pain now.
4890 2018-11-28 17:57:01 Thanks fictional president. Now, put #AmericaFirst and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain by giving us energy independence. No more foreign oil! You can do that too, can’t you?
4891 2018-11-28 17:56:56 Cenk is correct. The DNC would rather have Hillary run again and lose on purpose than to have Sanders run and risk potential to lose the money being tossed in their direction from big pharma, oil, and other large corporations. Progressives are working for the poor/middle not rich
4892 2018-11-28 17:56:48 A combination of resource curse (venezuelan oil, "Devil's excrement"), inequality, corruption and capped by a socialist dictatorship. The Chavista revolution started off well, but in the end caused the current collapse.
4893 2018-11-28 17:56:47 Its nice to dig the soil out from underneath your fingernails and get fancy every now and then! I find a warm milk & olive oil hand soak makes it easier.
4894 2018-11-28 17:56:36 Then why did he open up 2 wars to 8? If we are so great in oil? Oh yeah he opened fracking twice as much as BushJr did 

Obama is BushSr in 2008-2016 policywise
4895 2018-11-28 17:56:26 @CadburyUK how about not using # palm oil? It's not always been a part of everything we eat, make, consume 
4896 2018-11-28 17:56:24 Butane/ propane specifically.

Most LP are doing ethanol cleanups for CO2 extracts intended for edible oil products
4897 2018-11-28 17:56:24 He also blocked the Keystone and Dakota access pipeline which are desperately needed to transport oil for refining...he also promised to bankrupt the coal industry.
4898 2018-11-28 17:56:22 The oilers shitty play and offical biases are  not the same thing.
Have the oil played shit yes.
Does the league officails stick it to the oil every chance they get yes. In a span on two minutes there were 15 non calls against McDavid. Some minor were obvious and 2 high sticks
4899 2018-11-28 17:56:13 I JUST NEED MY CBD OIL TO GET DELIVERED. 

My back is on fire and tylenol, ibprofin, ect does not help at all. 


4900 2018-11-28 17:56:07 Steel Import Quotas Would 'Cripple' U.S. Oil, Gas Production, TIPRO Says
4901 2018-11-28 17:55:58 @ChristMercyLand are Yahweh sell Prophet Jeremiah oil and water
4902 2018-11-28 17:55:52 One of the reasons that we are beholden to the Saudis is that oil from OPEC is traded in US dollars. The Saudis have apparently threatened to take it off the dollar previously, which would have great economic impact.
4903 2018-11-28 17:55:51 Powell surprised the market by sounding dovish on his rate hike path. Equities zoomed and dollar sunk post the comment. With oil holding around $60 and dollar weakening, it is like India getting into a sweet spot across all asset class - equity, INR and bonds.
4904 2018-11-28 17:55:40 @RailMinIndia @IRCTCofficial 12377 padatik express, s4 coach. Stinky and torn seats. SOmething like oil in most of the seats. Have a look.
4905 2018-11-28 17:55:32 Any girls here use Coconut oil on their hair and can help me ? 
4906 2018-11-28 17:55:30 Got a message on my car telling me my oil was at 62% so flapping a took it too the garage to be told the oil is fine and I had just leaned on a button on the menu screen ...
4907 2018-11-28 17:55:24 It will be better if oil becomes worthless.
4908 2018-11-28 17:55:22 I heard castor oil works great for beard growth!
4909 2018-11-28 17:55:14 Alhamdulillah
4910 2018-11-28 17:55:14 The science programs in a lot of Oklahoma public schools are funded by oil companies. American education sold to the highest bidder.
4911 2018-11-28 17:55:10 Do the oil change just in case
4912 2018-11-28 17:55:10 Trump is succeeding big time in the exact areas Bush failed in; Controlling oil prices and immigration reform.
4913 2018-11-28 17:55:08 Every year he was President and especially towards the end, his last term, oil business was terrible and a lot of people lost their jobs and unemployment rate was the highest for Big Oil companies. What a moron. What a liar.
4914 2018-11-28 17:55:06 Also a definitive statement learned at uni, the agri industry is a worse polluter than the oil sands. Livestock, specifically.
4915 2018-11-28 17:55:03 Powell surprised the market by sounding dovish on his rate hike path. Equities zoomed and dollar sunk post the comment. With oil holding around $60 and dollar weakening, it is like India getting into a sweet spot across all asset class - equity, INR and bonds.
4916 2018-11-28 17:54:51 Refine oil is shit and can be mass produced at cheaper cost. That's why there is no shortage or inflation issue. Everybody can't afford healthy food.
4917 2018-11-28 17:54:39 Notley: Alberta contributes $22 billion more to Ottawa than we receive in return, even after the effects of the oil downturn and the recession.
4918 2018-11-28 17:54:37 Even if I wanted to anymore there's nothing on a menu I could eat. Even fries are cooked in the same oil as chicken and whatever, and eating a McD's salad is like rolling the dice with salmonella
4919 2018-11-28 17:54:37 Never seen someone with such a strong desire to not get re-elected. @JustinTrudeau mucking about with unions, sleeping with oil barons, and turning his back on his voters is just the tip of the iceberg. Con in Lib's clothing.
4920 2018-11-28 17:54:33 Jetzt verspricht uns @ElliKoestinger E-Fuel zur Lösung der Klimazerstörung im Verkehr und sie promotet das Plastic-to-oil-Projekt der OMV. Die schlimmste Umweltministerin, die wir je hatten!!! #klartext
4921 2018-11-28 17:54:31 I need an oil change 
4922 2018-11-28 17:54:27 I’m doing the coconut oil challenge and doing a 30 minute hair mask twice a week for a month and I’ve only gone through one week and my hair looks and feels AMAZING
4923 2018-11-28 17:54:24 It was not done in 16years during the period oil boom so relax and believe again. Next level, they will take care of that.
4924 2018-11-28 17:54:22 I thought he hated oil???
4925 2018-11-28 17:54:16 Modi has askedArun jetli to answer Rafale.Oil price go up&down depending upon production.Goraksh:Modi warned them,told states shd take strict action. How can PM talk abt a issue which is in SC .In all rallies PMtalks abt farmers' hardships.Soil card insurance,Bamboo all for them.
4926 2018-11-28 17:54:14 Premier @RachelNotley says "we
have placed a hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions from our oil sands. A hard cap." #cdnpoli #abpoli #ABleg
4927 2018-11-28 17:54:13 As a Trump supporter I must admit President Obama has a point!
He could have screwed the increase in U.S. oil production with over burdening regulations on Fracking just like Al Gore could have screwed up the internet but they didn’t.
4928 2018-11-28 17:54:10 I have never seen a blue palm oil or any other colour.
4929 2018-11-28 17:54:06 Taxer, interdire et subventionner c'est tout ce que fait l'appareil d'État. Pour les idées neuves il faut attendre
4930 2018-11-28 17:53:59 How's the oil spill coming along on the east coast?  Maybe it will spread out enough so you do not have to mention that it is happening on your watch ... Barbie
4931 2018-11-28 17:53:51 Best solution...stop looting the country. You and your fellow family dynasties!
4932 2018-11-28 17:53:50 I used to be in a relationship with a woman from Milan. She couldn't figure out why everyone in Canadian Italian restaurants was dipping their bread in a puddle of olive oil. 

<<È molto strano.>>
4933 2018-11-28 17:53:48 Germany depends upon Russia for its gas and oil and Turkey oil and gas pipe line.
4934 2018-11-28 17:53:44 I'd like to know how much he, his family and his cronies have made off of his tweets. Tweets about earnings and market sectors prior to govermental reporting announcements. Tweets about what oil producing countries should or shouldn't do..
4935 2018-11-28 17:53:39 Isnt this the guy that wanted to shut down the oil pipelines time and time again?
4936 2018-11-28 17:53:34 たまちゃんが一緒じゃないと寝れないよ……
4937 2018-11-28 17:53:32 Not as likely, cars made for the US market don't really go over that well here in Europe. For example. You guys build gas guzzlers that aren't very fuel efficient based on cheap domestic oil prices. We are generally speaking not in favour of these types of vehicles over here. IMO
4938 2018-11-28 17:53:24 Ryan has been running around feverishly trying to pass amnesty bills but needed President to brow beat to fund our military and Vets. As for Obama, now trying to take credit for oil. Delusion from a former Poser and Weak Chief
4939 2018-11-28 17:53:18 What type do you prefer? I like silicone myself, and I find Gun Oil is pretty great.
4940 2018-11-28 17:53:17 You will never see Joe attack big oil. Sad.
4941 2018-11-28 17:53:15 And if you have only skin... be careful with coconut oil. It is highly comedogenic which means it forms a barrier on your skin that can clog pores (acne).
4942 2018-11-28 17:53:13 Oil dy ur head oh
4943 2018-11-28 17:52:49 Tip #1 : put some rose oil in your conditioner to add some moisture to your hair! 
4944 2018-11-28 17:52:48 What is this about syrup being engine oil like wtf did i miss
4945 2018-11-28 17:52:48 So Obama is claiming to be the great “Oil Producer” - haha - Does he think we slept thru his presidency (as he appears to have)?   Thank the States like TX and ND that supported energy while he was an obstacle, albeit an ineffective one
4946 2018-11-28 17:52:47 @BarackObama @CRTV @AP @SenateGOP @nytimes @ThomasSowell @RealJamesWoods @marklevinshow @rushlimbaugh I See Mental illness in OBAMA! HE BELIEVES THE LIES HE TELLS ! He blocked oil drilling, He caused taxes to sky rocket , which hurt families, He Gave $ to Failed Solar Panel Co.
4947 2018-11-28 17:52:46 What he means is "they have Oil, they can get away with anything, thank you."
4948 2018-11-28 17:52:43 Policies to increase renewables would preclude the need for expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure.  The technology is there.  Political will is missing.  How be the oil and gas industry take care of those orphan wells and tailings ponds.
4949 2018-11-28 17:52:37 one of the best things on this bird app was that video exposing food commercials.. i cant see a food tweet now on my tl without the quote tweet being like "damn look at that engine oil"
4950 2018-11-28 17:52:26 in 1980 Saudi Arabia did distribute a lot of oil money to its citizens & they had very high incomes on global standards.  Now it is very different.  Ordinary Saudis live very modestly & MBS keeps the money himself, he's a trillionaire I read.

4953 2018-11-28 17:52:11 Who is believing this garbage? Obama put so many affirmative actions that we lost millions of job's he and his Democratic colleagues while in power was strangling oil , coal and business he was the worst President EVER  KNOWN AS A BOLD FACED LIAR & DIVIDER  OF AMERICA!
4954 2018-11-28 17:52:02 He talked of that but didn't took any action he wanted India to purchase his country's missile defence system.and if he wanted to bashed India he won't have India wavier over oil purchase from Iran.
4955 2018-11-28 17:52:01 It's like when you walked into church and seen the numbers on the wall of what hymn were chose for that day - walking out because Give me Oil wasnt scheduled
4956 2018-11-28 17:51:55 Almond oil,  olive oil, 4 drops sandalwood oil, and 4 drops rose essential oil,  mix it well.  Massaging it gently easing out every tension in my body. My #SecretSpaTherapy with a head massage too.

4957 2018-11-28 17:51:54 Getting my brakes done I hate when service lights come on might as well get my oil changed too
4958 2018-11-28 17:51:37 I literally can't get past the him telling us to rub our pussies in motor oil.
4959 2018-11-28 17:51:33 Please give me an example of what his Admin did to increase Oil or Gas Production?? I can give multiple examples of things they did to hinder it. “We can’t just drill our way out of this” proved what % false??
4960 2018-11-28 17:51:33 I remain suspicious of oil companies. The one argument they have that drives up the price of oil is that we will some day soon run out because it is essentially the flesh & blood of dinosaurs. We may outstrip the production of it, but I think the earth produces it!
4961 2018-11-28 17:51:25 Texans lost thousands of job in the Oil Fields during Obama's administration.
4962 2018-11-28 17:51:22 Headlines dictating price action. Trump needs something to look good. Rumors of biodiesel credit in new tax extenders bill pops soy oil, lifting beans.
4963 2018-11-28 17:51:19 I’m super stoked that oil changes went up in price aGAIN. Cars are overrated I’m moving to NYC
4964 2018-11-28 17:51:08 Headlines dictating price action. Trump needs something to look good. Rumors of biodiesel credit in new tax extenders bill pops soy oil, lifting beans.
4965 2018-11-28 17:51:06 Notley: Alberta’s oil is going to flow one way or another – if not by pipelines, then by rail or by truck...
4966 2018-11-28 17:51:01 Weird..... well I’ll let you know if this oil change place takes card bec I’ll have to walk somewhere to get cash  *nervously laughing*
4967 2018-11-28 17:51:00 A novelty football match played between All Stars of Bayelsa State and Friends of Tiwei to commemorate the birthday celebration of Chief Tiwei Timipa Orunimighen; The Special Adviser to the Bayelsa state Govr. on Peace and Conflict Resolution in Oil and Gas Producing Communities
4968 2018-11-28 17:50:57 It’s fun to have one guy controlling oil prices, interest rates, manufacturing jobs and trade deals... Trump-onomics
4969 2018-11-28 17:50:56 I’m still real life upset that I had to spend $45 on an oil change once every 6 months but don’t be giving any fucks spending 40$ every three weeks on my nails 
4970 2018-11-28 17:50:56 Wealth and reactionary politics go together like PB & J, or fish and white wine, or like oil fields and "regime change".
4971 2018-11-28 17:50:53 I’m glad my dad taught me how to change brakes, change the oil, and rotate tires on a car.. he always told me you really want your girl taking her car to shop full of men? Lmao i caught on what he meant by that so guess who got to learning at 16?
4972 2018-11-28 17:50:53 Got my oil changed, interior detailed, a new battery and my front windshield replaced, I’m responsible bitch!!!
4973 2018-11-28 17:50:49 Money and oil. For all that blood.
4974 2018-11-28 17:50:47 Total BS. My family own 28 oils companies . Obama did nothing but heap regulations on the oil industry and choke it. Trump removed the regs. Thank God
4975 2018-11-28 17:50:40 Alberta Premier @RachelNotley making the case for #pipelines. "Alberta’s oil once again hit an
historic low...
Selling for around $10 a barrel. Roughly $40 less than it should be getting, if you compare it to other world oil prices." #cdnpoli #ABleg #abpoli
4976 2018-11-28 17:50:29 every time I see an ad for pancakes or a picture or literally anything with syrup all I think of is motor oil
4977 2018-11-28 17:50:27 What a fucking liar...no, Obama it wasn't you. The Obama admin did everything they could to STOP oil production and fracking..our private industry pushed on in SPITE of you...what a POS!
4978 2018-11-28 17:50:21 Bet you're spitting feathers over your oil!
I'd be fuming if I were a Scot!
4979 2018-11-28 17:50:02 Im not because oil is a waste of time we've had free energy since the 50s time to catch up
4980 2018-11-28 17:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
4981 2018-11-28 17:49:58 All that counts is when the oil starts to flow 
4982 2018-11-28 17:49:54 i need to change my oil but my mechanic isn’t answering the phone n i cant be wastin gas drivin over there to see if theyre open 
4983 2018-11-28 17:49:48 Ur head get oil
4984 2018-11-28 17:49:44 If you make one decision a year to reduce oil or coal emissions, then you’re helping save the planet. Shaming every person who is trying to help the planet just because they don’t make the right environmental decision every second isn’t going to help anybody.Or is that your goal?
4985 2018-11-28 17:49:36 start out by masking the head to create a clean background.. grab a brush tool with healing, oil finish, and stroke pattern.. go back with fine sharpening.. to delete your tracks transform warp some parts of the photo so there is no identical finish..

4991 2018-11-28 17:49:21 Pipe down Kalpen Modi. Oil is cheap again. MBS is doing us a favour by kicking islamists in the nuts. You should be more worried about looney toons Erdogan, the modern day Caliph
4992 2018-11-28 17:49:18 Damn mfs can’t get a oil change 
4993 2018-11-28 17:49:17 yea he was the one that allowed fracking,   and paid billions to start solar power and pannels for the u.s.a ,  then putin pissed in his cheerios.   and made oil cheeper. to punnish  russia .  and took the legs out of solar.    yep he did

4997 2018-11-28 17:49:00 Lol in the pancake ads, there’s a video floating around on how they make the pancakes look good in commercials and they use motor oil and cardboard
4998 2018-11-28 17:48:59 No Thanks. Not until you source your palm oil responsibly
4999 2018-11-28 17:48:56 Neutrogena is really good, but when you wash so often it might help you ask for a special lipid balancing soap like they use in hospital? And also coconut oil over night can help 
5000 2018-11-28 17:48:55 How ridiculous is this? Now NDP is promoting shipping oil by rail? This is so inefficient compared with any pipeline, in terms of CO2 production, environmental risk and cost. Not to mention that the Canadian rail way crosses thru the centre of towns & cities #LacMégantic2013
5001 2018-11-28 17:48:44 Poor Taes hair it looks like the texture of hay someone give his boy a hot oil treatment and some protein masks for his hair 
5002 2018-11-28 17:48:35 Be careful with that, sometimes withdrawal from the CBD oil can cause more anxiety! If you want more unsolicited advice hmu
5003 2018-11-28 17:48:33 Monq’s are just essential oil diffusers

OIL had to be in Private lands bc of Obama blocking! Gave $ for FAILED SOLENDRA & caused OUTRAGEOUS taxes for Gas. Hurting millions
5005 2018-11-28 17:48:22 In June 2014, oil prices were $110 a barrel, today they're $59 a barrel. That's a 45% lower in 4 years. In March 2015 Oil prices were $59 a barrel too. So in 3 years no effective change. Yet in the last 3 years domestic energy customers continue to pay more.
5006 2018-11-28 17:48:17 Thank you for considering it. I'm just so in love with your oil I figured why not ask about a protein treatment too. I'll be purchasing soon in bulk. Thanks again for responding.
5007 2018-11-28 17:48:14 Give her CBD oil.
5008 2018-11-28 17:48:12 Any oil that can not be home made is not to be used. Sunflower, canola oil etc can only be extracted through factory process.
5009 2018-11-28 17:48:11 Grapeseed oil is better than coconut oil for cooking, skin and hair. Trifecta.

5011 2018-11-28 17:47:59 Sin looks beautiful on the outside. Her words are sweet to the ears and her logic for doing what she does is smoother than the finest oil. But remove sin’s mask and underneath is an ugly bitterness that will corrupt the soul and will cut the spirit like a sharp, two-edged sword.
5012 2018-11-28 17:47:55 Guy who was literally sued, and lost, because he tried to prevent American oil interests from drilling for oil, says the oil they got after drilling was "me."
5013 2018-11-28 17:47:41 Would I ship the bees if Yang was a boy?

Hell ya I would, like I said their relationship is so deep and obvious it's just a plus that Yang happens to be a girl because representation.
5014 2018-11-28 17:47:39 Obama is taking lessons from hLIARy on lying, Bush administration pushed for energy only to have Obama thwart the process by denying pipeline and oil drilling rights
5015 2018-11-28 17:47:38 Oil prices slipped, pressured by rising U.S. inventories and doubts over whether an OPEC-led output cut will be agreed next week
5016 2018-11-28 17:47:34 remind me who opposed ANWR for 8 years and who opened it in his first year in office?

I know we're not getting the oil yet, but illustrative of their attitudes towards production
5017 2018-11-28 17:47:34 Obama is still the biggest presidential fraud and scam artist in U.S. presidential history. That creep blocked oil and gas drilling everywhere he could on federal land and waters. he shouted against using gas fueled automobiles!

5026 2018-11-28 17:46:34 #Clewless of #gunsense nonsense wants you suckers to buy his regurgitated nonsense.  Snake oil salesman.
5027 2018-11-28 17:46:32 We only became the worlds leading oil producer once Trump lifting the regulations that Obama put in place
5028 2018-11-28 17:46:31 All while oilfield workers are losing their jobs on a daily basis. We cannot remain oil independent at there prices.
5029 2018-11-28 17:46:25 If oil goes below what it costs to recover it.  That's too low.
5030 2018-11-28 17:46:20 at least i didn't put oil on a fire .
5031 2018-11-28 17:46:18 Really hope SOMEONE on the team can find their scoring touch again. It's like drilling a depleted oil field with this year's team on the road.

5034 2018-11-28 17:45:47 He sure thinks highly of himself smh. He is a joke. He was totally against American oil.
5035 2018-11-28 17:45:44 we don't need this, it's just about petro$ and  has been for over a Century. What a different place the world would be without coal and oil. Solar wind tidal and geo can give us all we need. @Greenstorc_Ltd
5036 2018-11-28 17:45:38 BHO,how many women & kids did you tear gas at the border? You can take credit for that! The BP keeps records. They’re saying it averages about one tear gassing/month!

No, Al Gore can’t take credit for the Internet & YOU CAN’T take credit for American oil production-TRUMP DID IT!
5037 2018-11-28 17:45:14 oil well off the highs so far ES doesnt care
5038 2018-11-28 17:45:07 Notley: Just yesterday, Alberta’s oil once again hit an historic low... Selling for around $10 a barrel.
5039 2018-11-28 17:44:56 It’s snake oil. These celebrities should be more forthright about how they stay in shape. It’s not the tea. It’s like @jameelajamil said, it’s personal chefs and trainers.
5040 2018-11-28 17:44:55 If there were something like this for the oil industry, it’d be great
5041 2018-11-28 17:44:54 Yes!  We will make sure more oil rich countries dismember more journalists to ensure gas prices stay low!!
5042 2018-11-28 17:44:53 Yes, I've used it myself.  Great cooking oil too
5043 2018-11-28 17:44:53 You are seriously saying that an oil rich country of 5.5m educated people (whose oil rUK is relying on to cushion the effects of Brexit) will struggle to be independent?
Why is Norway not struggling?
How does Iceland manage?
Malta?
Luxembourg?

5046 2018-11-28 17:44:39 Oh boy, I'm sure this won't backfire like it did in 2006/7 when oil prices spiked and every moron who bought one of those behemoths was getting reamed by $80/tank.
5047 2018-11-28 17:44:35 I doubt this. Saudi will never be our ally. The only reason for the relationship is oil. Saudi still supports extremism and funds terrorists. They have done nothing for us, except make the US commit war crimes in Yemen and in Syria. Wasting taxpayers money on US military ops.
5048 2018-11-28 17:44:33 Mr. Obama did everything he could to fight & destroy the oil industry. Now he wants credit for failing.
He was good at failing.
We can thank him for that.
5049 2018-11-28 17:44:32 ran out of cooking oil  guess it’s a dry one for me tonight
5050 2018-11-28 17:44:29 Oil red again ... those dovish comments seems not to work...
5051 2018-11-28 17:44:24 Low price for oil makes it financially ludicrous to risk B.C's environment. Trudeau should fund the Alberta oil workers to switch over to solar installations or some other green industry. I don't care of French is dropped. They have Quebec. I don't want to be secular like Quebec
5052 2018-11-28 17:44:22 Fracking and other new methods lose money if oil goes below $40/bbl.
5053 2018-11-28 17:44:15 This snake oil salesman and 5th columnist Carney were spot on 2 years ago were they not? As for Osborne the pasty man glad he’s polishing the door knocker at the Standard, well no one listened to him anyway, a well known ‘polisher’
5054 2018-11-28 17:44:11 Start with yourself stop waiting on others take the lead no more excuses get rid of your oil based environmental destroying devices stop supporting them now do it right now!
5055 2018-11-28 17:44:02 So the excuse GM offers is "rising commodity prices" and "rising interest rates". Apparently they don't follow commodity prices and interest rates. Across the board commodity prices are down 17% since August. Oil is down more than 25%. Interest rates are falling: 3.23% to 3.05%.
5056 2018-11-28 17:44:00 So, Obama takes credit for the oil boom; and I guess he’s the tooth fairy as well...
5057 2018-11-28 17:44:00 nora just called olive oil from popeye olive garden
5058 2018-11-28 17:43:49 As long as we need oil, we'll be trapped by these relationships.  @realDonaldTrump has only half the energy equation in his policies.  Renewable technologies are the future for a multitude of reasons including economic & he's screwing it up with his one dimensional approach.
5059 2018-11-28 17:43:36 เรื่องไร กูจะได้ไม่ดู 55
5060 2018-11-28 17:43:27 Grapeseed oil is all purpose.
5061 2018-11-28 17:43:21 - imma get my first oil change tomorrow after school.
5062 2018-11-28 17:43:12 For everyone mentioning oil, gas and coal.. you do realize that is part of infrastructure. You heat your homes and run you lights. Even our water which is pumped needs energy to run. Everyone would be screaming at the government if those things went wrong!
5063 2018-11-28 17:43:02 I don't know you anymore 
5064 2018-11-28 17:43:01 Compare Auto to Oil threat. Immediate aggressive response with overt panic from media, politicans, labour, academia all rallying around national interests based on overproduction, combustion engines, emissions, petrol plastic parts etc. Suddenly nothing matters.
5065 2018-11-28 17:42:59 Good thing that solves China, emerging markets, housing, oil, autos, education, immigration, and climate change.
5066 2018-11-28 17:42:56 food opinion : i hate coconut,,,,if u bring anything that has cooked coconut in it (coconut oil etc),,,,ill puke on you
5067 2018-11-28 17:42:54 obama says he was pro oil and gas industry,,,it was his decisions that made america a great oil and natgas producer
5068 2018-11-28 17:42:53 Do you see how much money oil companies spend on TV advertising?  The TV networks aren’t giving that up.
5069 2018-11-28 17:42:51 I do remember something of an oil surplus in the gulf a few years ago.....and we let the oil company off the hook for destroying an entire ecosystem.
5070 2018-11-28 17:42:48 Grapeseed oil>>>>coconut oil
5071 2018-11-28 17:42:38 Try putting coconut oil on! I have to lock myself in until it soaks in.
5072 2018-11-28 17:42:29 Na anointing service them do jare..The oil dey too much for her forehead he con spread go her face.
5073 2018-11-28 17:42:26 Amazing how they are applauding increase in oil production these people have lost it. Isnt fossil fuel consumption going to bring on the apocalypse?
5074 2018-11-28 17:42:25 I like oil paint bc it’s so creamy and rich but I hate that it TAKES 87 YEARS TO DRY
5075 2018-11-28 17:42:18 extra virgin olive oil, just like grayson

-pours motor oil on his pancakes
-puts a dollop of shaving cream on pie
-drinks a little dish soap with his beer
-enjoys his chicken with some superglue
-loves cereal with glue milk

He’s not your man.  He’s that food advertisement video you all feel betrayed by.
5079 2018-11-28 17:41:48 "under my policies. energy prices will increase" .
Did his administration give oil companies any special tax relief? 
It appears it happened against his wishes and plans. 
+1 to free markets.. +1 to politicians taking credit when something happens against their plans 
5080 2018-11-28 17:41:48 do not forget to take care of the scalp, coconut oil is a good request

5083 2018-11-28 17:41:38 Avocado oil is even better. All the umami of butter, total flavor enhancement, but better quality fats. I use it as a substitute to basically every cooking oil/butter(except when baking sweets).
5084 2018-11-28 17:41:31 Change away from fossil fuels will occur at the margin. To replace an aging gas/oil furnace (when it finally croaks) with a modern electric heat pump costs how much? The price of a serviceable used car? Many Canadian households do NOT have that much $ sitting in a rainy day fund.
5085 2018-11-28 17:41:31 he likes to use the good olive oil 
5086 2018-11-28 17:41:30 Okay, I did oil based because it was for stage stuff, and on tour there weren't enough baby wipes in the world to make the guy at 7/11 not eyeball me. The color match on those tights is legit. Digital, custom, or just luck?
5087 2018-11-28 17:41:25 This alabaster jar is all I have of worth
I break it at Your feet, Lord, it's less than You deserve
You're far more beautiful, more precious than the oil
The sum of my desires and the fullness of my joy 
5088 2018-11-28 17:41:24 Speed 51 isn’t the same as Lucas Oil.  Apples, oranges. And it’s $34 for the premiere event of asphalt late model racing. Two friends could pay $15 a piece for what’s essentially late model Super Bowl.
5089 2018-11-28 17:41:22 I don't know what MDN is trying to get at here.  On face value, the response to this should be 100% to lower oil prices...
5090 2018-11-28 17:41:21 What happens when you have community organizer Obama getting into business. Over 1 billion loans defaults in green energy including the disaster Solyndra. Meanwhile, Trump has made the US the number one exporter of oil in the world with historic low unemployment rates.
5091 2018-11-28 17:41:20 I hate how religion mislead people... Anointing oil and water... Umuntu ayeke amaphilisi... My uncle was a classic example... He is gone namhlanje.
5092 2018-11-28 17:41:19 God is rational, practical, respectful, forgiving+kind. He is opposite of d.trump.Tar sands is money loser+must be abandoned if Canada's to reach emissions targets of Paris so planet can survive.Trudeau=weak leader who caved to big oil lobby.He should've funded electric car plant
5093 2018-11-28 17:40:57 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
5094 2018-11-28 17:40:56 I’ve done the oregano oil drop just under the tongue. Burns a little at first but really gets everything out QUICK!
5095 2018-11-28 17:40:47 That engine oil business is ruining the best part of Instagram.
5096 2018-11-28 17:40:45 Prayer 5:Father,in the name of Jesus ,let there be a release of fresh oil upon your servant for unusual impact all through Shiloh 2018. Ps.89:20

5097 2018-11-28 17:40:45 Today’s headline: 
“Trump’s impact on the lower oil prices has very negative impact on the world economy.”

Yesterday’s headlines:
“Gas prices rising under Trump has negative impact on US economic growth.”

Liberal Hypocrites.

5100 2018-11-28 17:40:28 Forecasts are Forecasts. There's a reason they are called that.

Plan A+? Sounds like more detail free bullshit from the snake oil salesmen.
5101 2018-11-28 17:40:27 Wrong Obama put all the regulations etc. to stop the drilling etc for Oil and destroyed Coal industry also.  Anything good now is because of @POTUS
5102 2018-11-28 17:40:26 Waiting for an oil change and an old lady looked at me and said “don’t take this the wrong way, but was is it with your generation and the ripped jeans? In my time, that would have been so embarrassing.”
 
Being pregnant and trying to stay calm, I simply said “bc we like them”.
5103 2018-11-28 17:40:25 Ya motor oil
5104 2018-11-28 17:40:25 Oil of tight spaces, when spread on your body allows you to fit through a space, 1 size smaller than normal
5105 2018-11-28 17:40:10 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
5106 2018-11-28 17:40:00 I wish every news anchor would ask these shills how much money they've taken from oil companies.
5107 2018-11-28 17:39:42 Def oil on those gloves. #gusher
5108 2018-11-28 17:39:36 Look up orphan wells and ask the people who own the land that they occupy how they feel about big oil.
5109 2018-11-28 17:39:30 Cbd helps people with all sorts of issues, and those who experience such things as seizures. My sister takes cbd oil for her anxiety, and it works. Some people would rather that than smoke because smoking will pop on a drug test.
5110 2018-11-28 17:39:29 Google tfpdl
5111 2018-11-28 17:39:26 Don't need their oil or money
5112 2018-11-28 17:39:22 Time to find out if former leader has suffered a stroke and is covering it up.  Seems he stood behind, or instigated, a huge push to deter oil drilling in this country.  Must be magic.
5113 2018-11-28 17:39:19 i finally understood the whole motor oil joke even tho i saw the video weeks ago. wow
5114 2018-11-28 17:39:11 There's been an active oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico for 14 years! Lots of blame there. The recent rollback on methane gas release affects the air and the water. Just empty words being spoken.
5115 2018-11-28 17:39:08 $chk Lower Oil Prices to Hit US Producers' Ebitda: CreditSights -- Market Talk
Amid crashing oil prices due to oversupply fears, CreditSights is forecasting a 24% drop in Continental's 2019 Ebitda to $3.4 billion. Chesapeake's Ebitda would be hit by a 17% drop to $2.5 billion
5116 2018-11-28 17:39:08 I would do what you did. Ask them for guarantees the interview will air. If not, they can go (about to be very rude) fuck themselves. If they rather give airtime to a fundamentalist Christian who gets paid by big oil instead of discussing the issue with an expert, why bother?
5117 2018-11-28 17:39:03 Got oil changed , vroom vroom came on shuffle let’s ride !
5118 2018-11-28 17:38:59 I know you're joking. The steel and oil thing is b/c most Americans I talk to really don't know how much trade and how important we are to them. And cheddar on a BLT? That is wrong. I'm sorry, that you like may be your opinion but that's just a WRONG opinion. #NochedderonBLT
5119 2018-11-28 17:38:55 I'm not convinced by the article. It's sets up a strawman argument for substitution with soybean production but it's not clear that this is what would happen by any means. What is clear is the impact of palm oil is devastating.
5120 2018-11-28 17:38:53 The real reason is  that you eliminated increasing the MPG average in order for oil companies to sell more gasoline. The other reasons are the tariffs  and big business bought their stocks back with all that tax credit money you provided them .
5121 2018-11-28 17:38:49 @mitchellreports That was not "artful" it was lying. the @CIA DOES have credible evidence that MBS knew. And the @GOP is in the pocket of big oil.
5122 2018-11-28 17:38:47 Jimmies are sprinkles, rippers are how we cook hot dogs deep fried in peanut oil, jug handles are a u turn on a highway to go on the opposite side of traffic and pizza is called a pie never pizza. And red gravy is Italian NJ for spaghetti sauce
5123 2018-11-28 17:38:44 Let's get real for a change. The whole world knows what happened, so what is the plan? How will the world punish a Saudi Prince for torture and murder of an AMERICAN RESIDENT? Money? What does freedom to murder with impunity cost? Cheap oil for a while?
5124 2018-11-28 17:38:44 To the Trump administration, one life doesn't matter compared to their arms and oil deal with the Saudi regime. Morals go out the window when it comes to these deals, with a crooked foreign government.
5125 2018-11-28 17:38:36 Obama shut-down off-shore drilling,  he shut-down the Keystone Pipeline, etc.
Obama didn't do SH*T for the oil industry.
5126 2018-11-28 17:38:35 The long term consequences of burning all that oil is we and everyone we love dies. Stop destroying our planet.
5127 2018-11-28 17:38:34 if my personal trainer pulled one of these babies out and tried to sell me some that snake oil i'd pitch him out the window with it. #puresnake

5130 2018-11-28 17:38:03 That's convenient. Giving oil rich Saudi Arabia a pass for oppressing Journalist's voices. Great look. #sad
5131 2018-11-28 17:38:00 The Joe Bidens have gas & oil interests in the Ukraine. What's up with this?
5132 2018-11-28 17:37:50 lets get this midnight oil running finish up my assignment, work, and pictures. THAN I CAN SLEEP the rest of my days.
5133 2018-11-28 17:37:49 .@Canada Government is a Joke, as is the @NewFoundLand Government should be held liable for mismanagement for said Oil Disaster, ultimately, taxpayers are on the hook yet again, while MP's worry about Xmas Holidays, and how popular they are on social media. @PremierofNL
5134 2018-11-28 17:37:48 As I recall, this gutless wonder was doing everything he could to oppose the pipeline and fracking while the oil industry went full steam ahead IN SPITE of him.He paid off his backers, like Tom Steyer, with policies opposing anything not GREEN and now he has the guts to say this?
5135 2018-11-28 17:37:48 Joints flexible? Get Empower Topical Relief Oil - Blended quality essential oils and carrier oils infused with cannabis derived cannabinoids
5136 2018-11-28 17:37:22 IF the "writing was on the wall"  why were successive Canadian governments pouring billions into this company?   IF those "billions" had been poured into pipelines to get our oil East this country would be prospering instead of teetering on the brink of recession.
5137 2018-11-28 17:37:18 That actually fucking worked really well, didn't think it would have lifted that amount of oil away.
5138 2018-11-28 17:37:18 Again he LIES!! Obama hates fossil fuels and did everything he could to restrict oil exploration.  Does the name Keystone XL Pipeline sound familiar?
5139 2018-11-28 17:37:17 On private lands. Much of oil was coming off government lands that increasingly got restricted.
5140 2018-11-28 17:37:17 Lmfao my dad has been hassling me about checking my oil and I finally did and texted him just to make sure and he left me on read :/ entonces por que chingas
5141 2018-11-28 17:37:16 Premier Rachel Notley is slated to speak at the Canadian Club of Ottawa. Listening in on the live feed, and expecting it to get started soon. No doubt she will speak about the oil differential affecting Alberta oil producers. #ableg #abpoli @edmontonjournal
5142 2018-11-28 17:37:03 Those on the right who are keen to point out the failings of the 70's are also keen to avoid certain facts. The first, it was Edward Heath who came up with the three day week and the second that the economy was subject to a serious blow from dramatically increasing oil prices.
5143 2018-11-28 17:37:01 Poor Ohio GM Workers. Sounds like they've never encountered a snake oil salesman before.
5144 2018-11-28 17:37:01 I'm kinda thankful I had to go out to buy olive oil cuz now I'm 100% sure I'm not leaving home for the rest of the week as it's FREEZING OUTSIDE
5145 2018-11-28 17:36:57 Critical thinking and @davidhogg111 are like oil and water.  How’s that for an analogy?
5146 2018-11-28 17:36:56 For the next 3 months I’m going to smell like kerosene, motor oil, and whiskey. I’m going to start a fragrance line.
5147 2018-11-28 17:36:53 Joints flexible? Empower Topical Relief Oil - Blended quality essential oils and carrier oils infused with cannabis derived cannabinoids.
5148 2018-11-28 17:36:51 Obama is a true narcissistic sociopath! He is actually telling people to thank him for us becoming the largest oil producer in the world! LOL
5149 2018-11-28 17:36:48 Ya know I think they may be of the mindset that if they kill a few more journalists they could bet oil to 15 bucks a barrel and we could all kill the environment faster which they'd claim as a win
5150 2018-11-28 17:36:47 Bae got a fresh oil change bouta wash and cut up
5151 2018-11-28 17:36:47 Going by the new #GDP series, India’s double digit growth dream appears distant. Data confirms that India couldn't sustain even 7-8% growth despite best period of cheap oil, capital, high consumption and large capital inflows.
5152 2018-11-28 17:36:42 A week of low oil prices & strengthening rupee - and everybody perks up - RBI Governor opens his mouth; BJP leaders begin to roar; opposition speaks muted;  the middle class tells the attendant " fill er up"!!
5153 2018-11-28 17:36:38 need check the oil leak
5154 2018-11-28 17:36:38 Notley expected to today announce purchase of locomotives and tankers capable of moving 120,000 barrels of oil daily from Alberta. Feds not participating.
5155 2018-11-28 17:36:38 45致した
5156 2018-11-28 17:36:34 LoL come and visit boys na , oil money. You’ll eat and be tired
5157 2018-11-28 17:36:33 #FuelPriceCut Petrol and diesel prices are now down by about 8% during the last 30 days while crude oil rates have declined by more than 25% in this period. A litre of petrol today costs Rs 73.57 in Delhi, Rs 79.12 in Mumbai
5158 2018-11-28 17:36:33 Especially if you just got done liquidating crude oil
5159 2018-11-28 17:36:33 If, as Pompeo just said, there is a peace deal in the works with Saudis about Yemen, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT instead of making an ass of yourself about oil prices. You call yourself a communicator but you are NOT. You have no idea how to be President.
5160 2018-11-28 17:36:16 Speculators and investors saw no future during the last Admin. Off Shore rigs were docked, the feds slow rolled any red tape dealing with gas/oil. But they threw $ at “Green Energy”, which failed miserably. Rigs are running, new leases are being signed and trucks are running now.
5161 2018-11-28 17:36:16 He tried to destroy oil production in this country and he really hurt coal production. He is apalling.  As long as the people watching this video are stupid or have Alzheimer’s this is a great speech.
5162 2018-11-28 17:36:16 壊れちゃう…
5163 2018-11-28 17:35:55 Wad up some aluminum foil, use liberally with oil.
5164 2018-11-28 17:35:52 Yeah sure!  Obama needs to take credit for Deep Water Horizon, the largest & longest oil spill in the atlantic ocean causing a mayor environmental disaster.
5165 2018-11-28 17:35:51 Finding out they pour engine oil on pancakes really got the streets all fucked up.
5166 2018-11-28 17:35:49 Wasn’t the increase in oil production due to extraction from state and private land? If I remember correctly, didn’t the Obama and the Democrats try to block drilling on federal land?
5167 2018-11-28 17:35:47 We will likely run out of oil anyway in this century. So the switch to sustainable energy sources and transportation technology is more or less set in stone. Last but not least, even Exon Mobile knew of a catastrophic climate change, when the word burns more oil, for decades.
5168 2018-11-28 17:35:43 I'm fucking screaming. "Rub some motor oil on your pussy. You'll be fine."
5169 2018-11-28 17:35:43 Would love to oil every centimetre of that up. Massaging it for hours! 
5170 2018-11-28 17:35:41 The @DetNewsOpinion staff hasn't written an article telling ppl why @realDonaldTrump doesn't deserve credit for things he takes credit for - like the DOW or oil prices - which is why today's article telling readers not to blame Trump for the GM layoffs comes of as hypocritical.
5171 2018-11-28 17:35:38 We are gonna be at Macro Oil in Broussard until 1pm. Taco ‘bout yum!
5172 2018-11-28 17:35:31 Deaddd

5175 2018-11-28 17:35:25 BP CEO SAYS WILL CONTINUE TO PLAN FUTURE OF BP BASED ON OIL PRICE OF $50-60/BBL: RTRS. #OOTT
5176 2018-11-28 17:35:24 I said justification not reason, but yes WMD too.  It wasn't just to control the oilfields, it was also to prevent Saddam making a pan-Arabic nation (his stated aim) and to preserve the dollar as the oil trading currency of oil.  Which is why France and Germany did not join
5177 2018-11-28 17:35:13 Everyone who went to school in the DC area knows that kids from Georgetown Prep were basically bros. Rape, discrimination and drinking is what they do. Ask anyone who attended Gonzaga, WIS, BBC o the Lycee.
And I do mean anyone.
5178 2018-11-28 17:35:13 earth + fire signs use oil paint and air + water signs use acrylic and those are the facts
5179 2018-11-28 17:35:13 The majority of oil under Obama was on private land - he had no control over those oil producers.
More drilling on government property was not considered. 

The "Just say thank you" is hysterical.
5180 2018-11-28 17:35:08 Taking credit for someone else's work. He is sure good for that. His administration did more to kill the oil and gas industry than any other in our history. He needs to shut up and go away.
5181 2018-11-28 17:35:08 We talked also about the trouble relationship of Trump with saudi Arabia ( oil and money, people and human rights are not interesting!) I was happy to be back home with such a weather. In the afternoon I stayed warm at home with book and tea...
5182 2018-11-28 17:35:07 I see staying as deceit kawai, I have a grandmas sis that was married fr over 15 yrs no kids, she seeked divorce and both of them remarried , her first daughter is even married with a daughter.
PS she's a reputable malama here In lag.
5183 2018-11-28 17:35:02 Why is there a pretty picture of South Pass, WY, on the cover of the USGS report on Greenhouse Gas Emissions? South Pass is never mentioned again in the report. Shouldn't there have been a picture of an oil well on Federal land, or something similar?
5184 2018-11-28 17:35:00 Good Saudi/USA relations only benefit the Saudis, big oil, and wealthiest Americans. They DO NOT share our values. They need our weapons far more than we need their oil. Let’s stop supporting them and let them sort it out with Iran on their own.
5185 2018-11-28 17:34:58 Your hair needs moisture. Like a protective creme you apply when it's wet or a light oil applied when it's dry.
5186 2018-11-28 17:34:47 What? You did all you could to kill oil. This man is delusional.
5187 2018-11-28 17:34:41 Ok seriously...where do you get your skills from??? I do wish I was this talented, your amazing!!!!!

Ps how did you do this? Is it a digital painting? If so what paints did you use? Acrylic or oil or something? (Sorry for the amount of questions)
5188 2018-11-28 17:34:40 えむさん、R@さん、クーラー×3さん、オレンジoilさん、おめでとうございます！ #ふわバナ
5189 2018-11-28 17:34:38 I wish crude oil never naturally existed in our planet. We'd have been a lot better off without it environmentally,
5190 2018-11-28 17:34:36 Every society has it's own history of why it is where it is.  Venezuela was already in a growing economic and societal mess that oil money under a planned economy helped save.  However, reliance on this and not breaking with Capitalism has resulted in where it is now...
5191 2018-11-28 17:34:35 #twhs
5192 2018-11-28 17:34:35 Drive to streetsboro for a free oil change or drive up the street for $30? 
5193 2018-11-28 17:34:25 The problem is that the trump administration is pro coal and pro oil. The rest of the world is moving away from gasoline / diesel powered domestic vehicles and the USA motor manufacturers are going to be increasingly isolated
5194 2018-11-28 17:34:19 Obama is such a narcissist. He forgets his entire (anti oil & gas) global warming narrative in an attempt to get some sort of recognition for the oil & gas successes. He can’t stand being on the outside looking in, especially with Trump getting better results than he did.
5195 2018-11-28 17:34:17 I love it it is so awesome I love the way you oil up your abs
5196 2018-11-28 17:34:13 Trying the Bergamot, Placenta, Bayrum Combo, Plus the Purpul hair oil because my hair is falling out after those locks
5197 2018-11-28 17:34:03 Why is it that every time I bring my car in for an oil change they find 3-4 other things that need to be fixed as well?  My $30 oil change turns into $500 bucks
5198 2018-11-28 17:33:56 Don’t know if I’m allergic to CBD oil or Eggs
5199 2018-11-28 17:33:54 He is the biggest jerk. He relies upon people not remembering him doing anything possible to prevent the pipeline, saying that he thought gas prices should be the same as in Europe and throwing a wrench into all oil drilling.
5200 2018-11-28 17:33:44 A possibility. Free college,  $15 min wage, free health care, universal basic income. These are some ideas that if they actually became reality would be s huge draw for everyone south of our border.
5201 2018-11-28 17:33:41 While it’s unfortunate that these people will be out of work, it’s also a lesson in reality. When you put your faith in a cheap, snake oil salesman, this is the consequence.
5202 2018-11-28 17:33:39 Obama’s EPA shut down coal and blocked oil. The man is delusional
5203 2018-11-28 17:33:38 @official_barak You are the laziest and most arrogant president that lever was president.  You amy think you made the economy and oil better but you lie.  You did nothing but try to bring this country to its knees.
5204 2018-11-28 17:33:38 99 Chevy Blazer 4x4. Everything works as it should except the engine is blown. Sent a rod through the oil pan. $500
5205 2018-11-28 17:33:36 So tired of the Blonde Brat & Olive Oil comparing EVERYTHING despicable POTUS does to Obama. That's why it's impossible for this panel to have 1 intelligent debate because these morons digress the topic down to a grade school argument. I'm sick of it!
5206 2018-11-28 17:33:31 Crude and distillate stocks rise, Gasoline, Heating oil reserves fall. $NG $CL
5207 2018-11-28 17:33:26 You think 4 is better than 6? I think in cases I could agree, but I think for schools like GM and Oil City it has helped so much, those are schools that should have a chance to get to state playoff but never did in 4 class systems.
5208 2018-11-28 17:33:21 I just remembered that time that I accidentally spilled Ashlie’s hemp oil for her hair all over the bathroom and panicked so I tried to get it back in the bottle from the dropper
5209 2018-11-28 17:33:20 Maybe I like motor oil??
5210 2018-11-28 17:33:10 He’s delusional. He had everything so over regulated, we couldn’t produce enough oil for ourselves, much less the world. What idiots believe this ? Not an ounce of common sense among them.
5211 2018-11-28 17:33:07 You know I have! And they made everything worse! In fact I could blame it on peppermint oil if I had taken any...
5212 2018-11-28 17:33:02 Who is this guy talking to, a bunch of idiots, he's not responsible for any oil production. He's the worst president ever...
5213 2018-11-28 17:32:54 *Walking into Jiffy Lube*

"I want an oil change, the whole oil change and nothing but the oil change, so help me God."
5214 2018-11-28 17:32:49 Do we really want to keep sending Canadians hard earned money to countries like Saudi Arabia for their Oil when we can have our people have good paying jobs building infrastructure to accomodate some energy independance in the short term 10-25 years?
5215 2018-11-28 17:32:41 No, no.  Haven't you heard?  All we have to do now is to turn the dial up or down on the sun!  Really!  Last week we could "dim" the sun.  Surely we can also "brighten" it for 'ya.
5216 2018-11-28 17:32:40 I don’t wanna ruin the tweet but peanut oil don’t cause any allergies for some reason  5 guys the same way and I eat at both no problem
5217 2018-11-28 17:32:22 wasn't he the jackass who wanted to stop pipelines, punish oil companies and tax by 10$/bbl when we were just about $30/bbl ? Only an idiot could believe this guy.
5218 2018-11-28 17:32:20 Put chicken breasts/thighs etc and veggies (whatever you want) on a sheet pan, throw some all season spices on them (or salt and pepper) and olive oil, toss it, bake for 400 for 25-30 mins and ya done

5220 2018-11-28 17:32:15 That’s motor oil
5221 2018-11-28 17:32:14 Says the man that killed coal and oil production to put up windmills and solar panels!! You, @BarackObama are a lying piece of !! Go flush yourself!!
5222 2018-11-28 17:32:12 This is absolutely the most nonchalant liar I have ever witnessed.  Obama forcibly OPPOSED energy production.  He banned oil drilling, shut down coal, rejected his state department's rec on Keystone Pipeline 6 times.

5224 2018-11-28 17:31:51 Since we give away our rebate too, I wonder how much of a rebate on the £39B ms May gets once she ties us the the EU and retires from public life? Blair had his oil/war, Brown has his banks May has her EU

5227 2018-11-28 17:31:37 BP CEO Bob Dudley says he still sees Donald Trump as friendly towards the oil & gas industry, despite the US President calling for lower and lower prices.

Says Trump admin has cut regulation for the industry #OOTT
5228 2018-11-28 17:31:37 Obama did all he could to suppress oil production by way of regulations.
5229 2018-11-28 17:31:32 My cousins best friend has a barber that dated a guy that works at jiffey lube where magic got his oil changed. The trade is on ball imgram kcp for Beal
5230 2018-11-28 17:31:27 A reminder that @EIAgov will be publishing monthly data (EIA914 survey) for US #oil production on Friday (Nov 30). Weekly data pegged Sep output at 11.047m b/d, which is likely to be revised significantly higher, after monthly data for Aug was revised to 11.346m b/d | #OOTT 1/3

5234 2018-11-28 17:31:00 Remember, Americans are the people who can be told that directly applying olive oil which is 100% fat is somehow beneficial to your heart as “good fat.“ Swear.
5235 2018-11-28 17:30:59 To your friends too! I'm anticipating all that Oil Down and lemon cake that will come forth...
5236 2018-11-28 17:30:51 I sure know this
5237 2018-11-28 17:30:47 Wow just think of all the really good things you COULD have accomplished if you had stayed true to America and what we voted for. You’re almost as pathetic as obama taking credit for all the oil in America. #dbag
5238 2018-11-28 17:30:42 Yeah. Canadians could have been millionaires too if PET has just nationalized oil & gas in the 1970s and followed the advice we gave to the Norwegians.  Alas, we did not and the same goofballs who stopped nationalization now want us to build a useless pipeline.
5239 2018-11-28 17:30:34 Your wager is false, I believe all three are real. I'm not right winged, I am actually fairly centered. With the revenue from oil exports we can find alot of social issues in the short term as well as renewable energy development. There are plenty of solar and wind projects now.

5242 2018-11-28 17:30:23 Before I read this, I am going to guess Shane Doans draft year for the oil. But I know there’s a lot of bad draft years, so I won’t be surprised if I’m wrong.

5247 2018-11-28 17:30:09 It's a well known fact that Obama was a huge proponent of the oil & gas industry.  Who doesn't remember his signature XL Pipeline support, his opening of ANWR or his encouraging new exploration off the coasts? Give the man his due!  Lol.
5248 2018-11-28 17:30:00 I'm convinced people can sense—like used motor oil down their spine—when I've clicked Reply to their Twitter conversation with other people and am composing a response. Then it goes away and relief floods in when I delete my tedious comment, and they wonder what that was about.
5249 2018-11-28 17:29:50 You are talking about British media. With few honourable exceptions, they thrive on lies and inaccuracies. The bulk of the mass media is comprised of publications and broadcasts whose integrity is lower than that of a snake oil's salesman.
5250 2018-11-28 17:29:50 Trump doesn't want a repeat of the 1973 oil crisis you must be old enough to remember.

5252 2018-11-28 17:29:31 Obama is such an idiot! He is the party that was against fracking and that is why our oil is down we started using oil sand and fracking! Obama was outlawing it that bull every time he opens his mouth
5253 2018-11-28 17:29:31 I have read through some stuff on the idea about running out of oil...

Sounds plausible... Not sure I would put my ducks in that basket...

Again... What say you about God emperor?
5254 2018-11-28 17:29:30 So shun him. Dont use his oil. Leave national security to professionals
5255 2018-11-28 17:29:29 For electric cars eh? Sounds like a Saudi move to me. Way to earn there cash you cockroach. With or without this dirtbag Americans need to get away from Oil ASAP
5256 2018-11-28 17:29:29 Perfectly orchestrate by Trump. He setup up the Saudies and Russia to pump and flood the market with oil and then extended Iran supply to by inflation covert for the Fed. I don't think it holds but shorts are hurting now.
5257 2018-11-28 17:29:26 Good morning South Sudan!  We are receiving many offers and investment opportunity from @Plaid_USA for our oil.  Big money is coming in.

5259 2018-11-28 17:29:14 Gonna have to call bull shit on this. It was your party and liberals who delivered the highest wealth and income inequality since the Great Depression. Oil is volatile. We bitch when it goes up and bail out the industry when it goes down. We need to reduce our dependency period
5260 2018-11-28 17:29:12 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
5261 2018-11-28 17:29:05 There was due process when there wasn't 5 to 8,000 in line and thousands more on the way. Since it's a non partisan thing, repelling border crashers, maybe the problem is with them and not us. 80 to 90% have no claim, but won't accept no for an answer.
5262 2018-11-28 17:28:56 #resist As idealistic and unrealistic as it may sound, I am now convinced that one single human life is worth more than all the oil that was every taken from the soil of this earth.

5266 2018-11-28 17:28:48 Tried dabbing oil with my friend. Got so high I had to apply for short term disability #chewyexperiences
5267 2018-11-28 17:28:42 Blaming @fordnation for @GM pulling our of Ontario is as ridiculous as @jkenney blaming @RachelNotley for the collapse of the oil industry in Alberta. Kenney blaming Notley for lack of pipeline access is also just as ridiculous. It's all ridiculous.
5268 2018-11-28 17:28:37 Well of course for run of the mill fish oil it’s cheap. Although even thats more expensive than the $9 vascepa copay.
5269 2018-11-28 17:28:27 I always ask about my oil options as if im not going to pick the cheapest one
5270 2018-11-28 17:28:16 My super said she uses CBD oil instead of the "other stuff" -_- bitch I'm bout to start my drug habit again lol no one cares at this job

One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a reason bec we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced.''T
5273 2018-11-28 17:28:12 this is a good example of "experts and their predictions" being completely wrong because technology evolves, we've heard about peak oil for decades, still waiting for peak oil production...

5280 2018-11-28 17:27:52 I just got a sub from Wegmans. This is a huge treat and i was so stinking excited... until they forgot to put sub oil on it. My day is ruined.
5281 2018-11-28 17:27:43 Now we're an oil country.  Ha!  That guy can lie all the time and many would believe him.  Sad.
5282 2018-11-28 17:27:42 The man who brought us Solyndra wants to take credit for our oil boom. Lol.
5283 2018-11-28 17:27:37 With our resources we would flourish, how many independent oil producing nations rely on food banks to feed some of its population, all our exports etc have to go through Heathrow, therefore all taxes remain in London with Scots getting pocket money in return
5284 2018-11-28 17:27:37 Honourable @Dora_Siliya how come the Saudi oil lasted only 6 days, yet it was "apparently" cheap but this time around when the prices went high, you bought more than enough?

This is in reference to your statement on fuel prices remaining the same.

5286 2018-11-28 17:27:23 If we had any kind of decent and uncorrupted economy that wasn't solely based on oil, it wouldn't be as miserable.  But the fact that @AGJeffLandry sues impoverished citizens with exorbitant fees for debts they don't owe, it makes it impossible to get ahead. Much less catch up.
5287 2018-11-28 17:27:22 Have return email from then President Obama. Sent to an average American, saying that he knew it was important that we have oil but only if it didn't hurt the environment. Now God Obama wants credit for oil and all things good, but he will continue race baiting for votes.
5288 2018-11-28 17:27:18 I might come by there tomorrow I’m off i wanna see journee pls i get my oil changed over there
5289 2018-11-28 17:27:17 Yup.... CBD oil is where it's at
5290 2018-11-28 17:27:16 "You didn't build that."
5291 2018-11-28 17:27:12 Oh yeah, I get it. If you hadn’t tried so hard to kill the domestic oil and gas industry they wouldn’t have worked so hard to succeed, right Zippy?
5292 2018-11-28 17:27:01 Now I can’t look at pancakes without thinking there’s cardboards & motor oil on it
5293 2018-11-28 17:26:57 The savvy Capitalist, packed with conventional economic know-how, will retort, “We will always have the poor.”

Not if we waged war on poverty with the same vigor and patriotism we use to wage war in foreign lands over oil and other natural resources.

5294 2018-11-28 17:26:56 Back in the day, I made oil country tubular products by electric resistance welding. My job was to inspect these welds ultrasonically. We always hated to hear Steel Dynamics coils were going into production.  we were constantly cutting defects.

5297 2018-11-28 17:26:39 In a deregulated market,price is determined by law of supply and demand .
but Congress can control price by borrowing 1.5lakh crore for vote bank politics and as a result 20 thousand crore of annual budget have to paid as interest to oil companies each year.

5299 2018-11-28 17:26:33 Production did go up significantly during his term, at end started to dip again. Went back up in 2016. The oil production increase had nothing to do with Obama's policies, grew IN SPITE of his policies because of new techs. His policies began a downward trend that Trump reversed.
5300 2018-11-28 17:26:26 I have about 18 windows open on my laptop

better go burn that night oil sigh
5301 2018-11-28 17:26:17 We currently produce enough food for 52% of the population, at full capacity we could probably produce about 75%. No iron ore, no coal, little or no natural gas and oil, no precious metals, our fishing industry accounts for >0.05% of GDP, our car industries..
5302 2018-11-28 17:26:02 Well if GM made a vehicle worth buying might help....Since a vehicle today cost more than my first home, I expect it to last me more than than 5yrs.  I buy Toyota's, resale is excellent and they don't require a trip to a mechanic, only  quick oil changes...

The Arabs are the most disgusting and despicable beings on our planet!  The only reason they get any respect is because of oil!
5305 2018-11-28 17:25:44 Yes you did. But by all means, continue to blame the previous government, it's not like we haven't had a new one for 3 years. I'll spell it out for you as it appears your reading comprehension is low. Liberal logic: oil bad. Building cars that burn fuel made from oil good.
5306 2018-11-28 17:25:40 Yep, Obama restricts oil production, creates job killing policies, & shuts down oil pipe lines & production facilities, but now that President Trump has made America a strong competitor in the export of oil, Obama desperately tries to take credit...this guy is embarrassing!

5309 2018-11-28 17:25:34 @ObamaNews President Obama moved to solidify his environmental legacy Tuesday by  withdrawing hundreds of millions of acres of federally owned land in the  Arctic and Atlantic Ocean from new offshore oil and gas drilling. Your tried to stop drilling for oil your a fraud
5310 2018-11-28 17:25:33 Trump doesn’t want to believe in climate change because he knows it will be a conflict with his plans for coal and oil production. The exact same reason he’s avoiding taking repercussions on the murder of an American in Saudi Arabia.

5319 2018-11-28 17:24:59 I don’t feel like sitting to get an oil change. Reckon my bf will do it this weekend  lol
5320 2018-11-28 17:24:53 That pours more oil on the fire as UK should be ready. Shows incompetency of UK government. Had nearly 3 years to plan for it but PM refused. Never mind let's just change leader get prepared over next 4 months for WTO we can at least do that. At least UK avoids this bad deal.
5321 2018-11-28 17:24:52 That sadly will be common with LPs. Even Organigram years ago admitted to me they irradiated their product and that’s how it passed. The only way to not be involved in stock plays is to grow your own. Making your own oil is simple.

5327 2018-11-28 17:24:34 Oil industry 2010-2014- record employment in the oil industry, barrel of oil average 2010-2014 $100.00 a barrel, high school and GED employees were making a $100,000.00 a year, we were cementing wells everywhere, bonuses and stock options were through the roof
5328 2018-11-28 17:24:33 If u keep referring to Norway.  We need to make money on our oil so we have money for green investment.  And Alberta wages are the highest in the country.  More federal income tax per person.That’s why to ship transfer money out of Alberta.Albertans pay way more than fiat share.
5329 2018-11-28 17:24:32 That Lazarus heyi , would've boiled cooking oil with sugar stru God
5330 2018-11-28 17:24:32 And that doesn't even include the fact that Russia is selling more natural gas and oil since Trump got in office, he's done everything he could to help Russia and at the same time look at what he's doing to America, GM just yesterday, he's lied about campaign promises.

5333 2018-11-28 17:24:23 The program is NDP are not cutting back on anything and we do not have the resources to keep this spending like we are . Oil will never again  pull us out of the hole we have dug.
5334 2018-11-28 17:24:21 Yep, I bought a Chevy in 2014 & it’s still running like new. Had an oil leak last month but repairs were covered by their warranty. It was a  buy & I look forward to  their new hybrids

5337 2018-11-28 17:24:17 Artists: what do you think are the two most important oil paint colors when you’re painting flesh that you can’t paint without? I love transparent gold ochre and alizarin crimson.
5338 2018-11-28 17:24:01 No it was not. You halted fracking. You halted oil pipelines.

5342 2018-11-28 17:23:44 No pipeline built while he was in office! His buddy Warren Buffet had large interest in CSC railroad which of course transported the oil from Canada. The Big O was protecting our environment from those horrible pipes you know!
5343 2018-11-28 17:23:44 didn't Obama try and stop oil drilling

5348 2018-11-28 17:23:09 They have to get their steel from outside the USA because you keep shipping US oil out instead of using it here to process our own from scrap.

5350 2018-11-28 17:23:00 To successfully transition to renewables we need to fly under the radar. Oil oligarchs control the government and media.Get a toehold, then spread in areas they don't have interest in. Get local cooperation in friendly ways.

5352 2018-11-28 17:22:47 Diced in olive oil in a cast iron skillet. Or mashed/baked with pepper and butter if someone else makes them for me
5353 2018-11-28 17:22:42 I hear the price of oil globally has gone down 
5354 2018-11-28 17:22:35 Es politicamente incorrecto o de mal gusto ver Roma y no anunciarlo?
5355 2018-11-28 17:22:33 na which oil you dey use?
5356 2018-11-28 17:22:23 They are trying to avoid dealing with this tragedy so they can make deals for oil with Saudi Arabia. Greedy bastards.

5362 2018-11-28 17:21:50 To all the oil companies out there whatever ya doin I appreciate it cause gas is under $2 finally
5363 2018-11-28 17:21:49 And what makes you think the police protector won't get his fair share of the palm oil bath. Hell hath no fury...................
5364 2018-11-28 17:21:44 Oil and production grew despite the Obama crew’s best efforts. Cash for clunkers was a real kickstarter to the economy, I’ll give you that...
5365 2018-11-28 17:21:38  Create a relaxing bedtime ritual! May be soaking in a warm bath, listening to soothing music, practicing your mindfulness or meditation, setting up essential oil diffuser, etc. Find what works best for you!

GW is a sister company of Monsanto & Bayer. Bayer who makes medicines was part of Farben who made Cyclon B for Auschiwtz
5370 2018-11-28 17:21:25 Olive oil and a crowbar usually works best
5371 2018-11-28 17:21:14 No, you can test them at a lab. When I was in oil and gas, we vetted, sampled and tested every thing, even if we didn't transact. It was worth our reputation & credibility, and worth a lot of value--whether we could trust the source or not, what we could do with the product, etc.
5372 2018-11-28 17:21:03 When that growth based solely on exports its not shocking. TBH if Nigeria has no oil the level mismanagement of the economy would see us no better than Somalia. In fact we may have had more wars
5373 2018-11-28 17:20:53 I’ve been using vitamin E oil on my face every night for the last couple of days and my face has started to have a nice glow
5374 2018-11-28 17:20:51 The surge in oil production began following eight straight years of declines during the Bush Administration, oil production rose for the first 7yr of the Obama. From 5 million barrels per day in 2008, crude oil production rose by 88% to 9.4 million in 2015.

5377 2018-11-28 17:20:48 He’s just trolling now for fun, quite obviously. But he still clearly knows nothing about business, and no Barack - you DIDNT build that oil boom!! It was despite his worst efforts to snuff it out.
5378 2018-11-28 17:20:47 A man made scam...keep pushing that snake oil.
5379 2018-11-28 17:20:44 Powell's Oct.. 3 comments and those today are both well within the standing Fed outlook for 2019 - which already builds in plenty of flexibility.

His role in the market pullback vastly overplayed.

Powell didn't send $AMZN from $2,000 to $1,500. 

Powell didn't crash oil.
5380 2018-11-28 17:20:41 ง่วงมากพี่ไม่ไหวแล้ว
5381 2018-11-28 17:20:41 imo: oil looking pretty long early 2019- if it gets to low 40s, perhaps a buy - but will keep following
5382 2018-11-28 17:20:37 No the reason given for Iraq was that Sadam had WMD but the reality is it was to gain control of Iraq's oil fields.
5383 2018-11-28 17:20:37 Powell doesn't mention energy in his speech but the drop in oil prices will cut inflation and more importantly, it will lower inflation expectations. That helps to buy time for the Fed to wait-and-see on the impact of rate hikes so far.
5384 2018-11-28 17:20:24 More accurate to say "in spite of you" after Obama/Dems tried to pass carbon taxes and revise tax laws to target the oil industry.
5385 2018-11-28 17:20:22 Hate to be preachy but how come people are starting to care about palm oil but most still eat meat????
5386 2018-11-28 17:20:07 India has got Pakistan on the rope.  Russian S400 assured. Trump/Pompeo tweets supporting 26/11. US relents on oil and Chabahar. China under sanction by USA. Chinese Investment in Pakistan going down the drain due to FATF & IMF and opposition by Afganistan, India and US..
5387 2018-11-28 17:19:58 For that last tweet. I’m doing an oil change, new tires for the truck I’m assigned. So for those two bitches that complain that don’t understand me here is to regarding that tweet.
5388 2018-11-28 17:19:49 Now do subsidies to the oil companies
5389 2018-11-28 17:19:49 Do you recall the tweet I’m talking about? The syrup was motor oil to make it look good

5392 2018-11-28 17:19:38 Estimado Rodrigo, cuando estuve en Japón este febrero me llamó la atención el montón de carteles de educación vial. Por todos lados, aun en inglés "keep calm and be quiet", constante y amable educación cívica. Tomé un montón de fotos. Debríamos hacer algo similar aquí.
5393 2018-11-28 17:19:38 It says I can’t DM your account. What can you tell me about your use of palm oil?
5394 2018-11-28 17:19:38 8.2% GDP growth, inflation below 5%, oil below $60, dynamic/corruption-free govt, hindutva rising ! Best times, isn't that ?
5395 2018-11-28 17:19:31 No, but it's made with over a pound of butter, so maybe she could oil up & slip through the bars!
5396 2018-11-28 17:19:31 ไปคิดมาสิ
5397 2018-11-28 17:19:26 your desperate attempt to remake the world for your own benefit is criminal. you are so eager to prove you know more than any previous president that you would tear apart this republic for your own ego. Renewable energy is the future and you drag us back to an era of oil barons.
5398 2018-11-28 17:19:15 And it allowed the US to be less dependent on middle eastern oil. 
5399 2018-11-28 17:19:11 Deepika puts too much oil on her hair @deepikapadukone
5400 2018-11-28 17:19:05 I should mention that I actually am in favor of his taxes on oil.
5401 2018-11-28 17:19:04 This clown did nothing but pass regulations to try and stop oil production. Thanks to technology and fracking (which he tried to stop as well) we manage to pull ahead. Like all good con men, no doubt will try and take credit for the success, despite trying to trip it up.
5402 2018-11-28 17:19:01 อยากได้ตลกๆ
5403 2018-11-28 17:18:57 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
5404 2018-11-28 17:18:56 The only way they can get the steel needed for new cars is to recycle steel from wreck yards, and that eats a lot of fuel. We export more than what the US uses from its oil fields, so we can't produce much.
5405 2018-11-28 17:18:55 When eatting "plain" oatmeal,
Heres a tip: add coconit oil to it. ;)
5406 2018-11-28 17:18:55 Mon maap juga temen temenku, bukan aku bermaksud pelit untuk memberi oil control ku, ketika aku ketahuan memberi satu, semua orang langsung meminta. Tahukah kalian, aku membelinya dengan separuh uang jajan, mo nangis aku tu 
5407 2018-11-28 17:18:52 People call Trump narcissistic but Obama takes the cake. He's responsible for everything good and nothing bad during one of the worst economic performances over 8 years (at least since Depression) and regs trying to strangle oil and coal. His jud. appts continue to give problems.
5408 2018-11-28 17:18:48 don’t do that! lol coconut oil has done wonders 
5409 2018-11-28 17:18:41 Thanks America on becoming the #1 producer of Oil!

5415 2018-11-28 17:18:22 He is not responsible for oil or stocks. He’s full of it! The day @POTUS got elected was the day my stocks skyrocketed. Oil? Ha ha ! He did everything to stop oil! How many times he tax gas??

5418 2018-11-28 17:18:13 But most people don't even know about this because its kept in the dark. Fuck oil companies
5419 2018-11-28 17:18:12 Maybe I'm not cantankerous enough in my old age, but I'm not sure Powell did anything wrong here: Softness in housing. Wage inflation tame. Oil falling. HY widening. Econ weakness in Europe. Easy to argue that being more balanced here is the right move.

5430 2018-11-28 17:16:43 Just heard one more company is heading east to invest " to much red tape and Government in Alberta much easier in Saskatchewan, Manitoba" and this has zip to do with Oil and Gas.  So here we in Alberta we will throw the family out with the bath water.
5431 2018-11-28 17:16:41 I was in the oil business during his administration. When he came into office, you could tell that a directive had been passed down to the DOI BLM on Federal lands, that getting permits, etc. became a very slow drip. Cooperation was at an all time low.
5432 2018-11-28 17:16:36 What is so wrong about cooking for a man? I cook for mine and don’t mind at all. He changes the brakes and oil in my car. Whatever works!
5433 2018-11-28 17:16:27 I’m considering CBD oil for ME! Lol. Boydog is still quite young, age 5. First step for him is to see if a little weight loss helps as corgis are known to easily strain joints if they’re overweight and he is, uh, hefty. :)
5434 2018-11-28 17:16:25 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

5440 2018-11-28 17:16:10 Obama Touts Climate Change Legacy, Then Takes Credit For US Oil Boom - BO is the first authentic jive turkey scamster we ever have had in the White House. Good he's gone. Very good.
5441 2018-11-28 17:16:09 Lets hope the incoming President of Mexico explains to the public at large, where all the oil revenues went to over the years..... an explanation with certified accounting records attached....

5445 2018-11-28 17:15:45 You have nothing to do with oil prices.  Good God man.  Have you no shame?
5446 2018-11-28 17:15:39 And prior to 74 we had:
There’s no oil, don’t be daft
It’s too remote
It’s too deep down & inaccessible
The sea’s too deep, rough, wild.
Weather’s too windy
No viable seaport, onshore infrastructure
No robust enough rigs
Too remote for pipelines
Too deep for platforms
5447 2018-11-28 17:15:39 Bush jr was the reason for mining the oil sands and fracking wtf
5448 2018-11-28 17:15:33 Oh my god...this is so embarrassing.   Obama was against the pipeline.. he reduce or shut-down offshore drilling... he did NOTHING to encourage oil production.
5449 2018-11-28 17:15:32 He Sacrificed Khashoggi for cheaper oil, he will trade you for a box of vodka.  Sadly, I wish this was an actual joke.  Please stay safe @Billbrowder
5450 2018-11-28 17:15:27 Ahh, that explains it. Berkeley. Apparently YOU don’t understand. The Saudis have stabilized the Middle East and kept terrorism to a minimum. Without their assistance all hell will break loose. We don’t need their oil. We need them as allies to hold off attacks on other allies.
5451 2018-11-28 17:15:27 Plastic is made from oil primarily.
Oil oligarchs slowly introduced plastics into every aspect of our lives. B4 that paper was used in various forms. Pop Bottles were glass. Straws were paper. You're right. Thank you Miss Bette.
5452 2018-11-28 17:15:24 Immune Boom is a fantastic oil and is so beneficial around this time of the year!

5454 2018-11-28 17:15:01 Back in the 1960’s we,(USA), had the largest oil reserves in the world...(Period)! You Mr. Obama were just a baby back then. Do yourself a favor and shut your, baby’s,(pie hole), for the good of our country. Thanks!

5462 2018-11-28 17:14:26 Interesting because you get rid of oil leaks which are a legacy issue
5463 2018-11-28 17:14:26 Extra.

What does that mean?

It means some company is taking oil from the ground faster than it can be sold.

Solution? Stop taking oil from the ground faster than it can be sold.
5464 2018-11-28 17:14:25 And yet, Obama didn’t want to export our oil. I’m sure he apologized to other nations for our oil wealth too.
5465 2018-11-28 17:14:14 UBS 1/2: #G20: Investors will also be closely watching for any developments on oil. Saudi Arabia & Russia, two of the world’s top producers, are expected to discuss steps to stabilize oil prices, which are down by 30% since start of Oct.
5466 2018-11-28 17:14:05 Oil & Natural Gas Corporation has said that Alka Mittal has been appointed as the executive director of the company with effect from November 27.
5467 2018-11-28 17:14:03 The science disagreed with him though. That's the odd thing. He flat out rejected the science for the proverbial snake oil, then attempted to pin a political agenda on me for disproving him. It's no different to anti-vaxxers. Pseudoscience to justify political leaning and attack.
5468 2018-11-28 17:14:01 not oil, money & political power

5471 2018-11-28 17:13:57 With 'Osmonde Royale S&C' we presented here on June 28, 2016, an archetypical masculine fougère skeleton, just to feminize it a few days later, on July 3, 2016, by inverting the 2-phenylethanol/geranium oil ratio from 1:3 to 3:1 and enhancing the powdery aspects, …
5472 2018-11-28 17:13:57 GE stocks continue to fall as the Boston based company continues to reinvent itself. The GE of the future will focus on energy generation: think jet engines, power plant turbines, and windmills. It is exiting oil, lighting, train and health care industries!Success or failure?
5473 2018-11-28 17:13:56 Yep, Obama restricts oil production, creates job killing policies, & shuts down oil pipe lines & production facilities, but now that President Trump has made America a strong competitor in the export of oil, Obama desperately tries to take credit...this guy is embarrassing!
5474 2018-11-28 17:13:54 Don’t forget also the government collects royalties on the oil produced . I am certain there are no royalties paid to the government for automobiles.

5478 2018-11-28 17:13:28 Aren't you shafted twice over oil?  You certainly get the arse end of the deal.
5479 2018-11-28 17:13:17 Oil ? What’s that ?
5480 2018-11-28 17:13:17 Lmao the man in front of me came for some recall and the lady was like he need an oil change and some other stuff and he said, ma’am, y’all said it was a recall so I came for the recall. I don’t need nothing else 
5481 2018-11-28 17:13:13 Stopped eating Cadbury it doesn’t taste the same anymore and you use palm oil!
5482 2018-11-28 17:13:12 before be oil blood money
5483 2018-11-28 17:13:07 @BarackObama Oil production in America was up during your presidency in spite of you. You did everything you could to cut oil production and make gas more expensive. You know this is the truth, so stop lying.
5484 2018-11-28 17:13:02 Sama kayak oil control biru clean n clearku yang sering dimintain :”) agak gak ikhlas gimana gitu.
5485 2018-11-28 17:13:02 Wait - isn't palm oil the most sustainable, and almonds some of the least? So shouldn't you be more concerned about the almonds?
5486 2018-11-28 17:12:59 he also cheered the oil industry.
5487 2018-11-28 17:12:54 the tweet is correct and you are wrong.

you are a snake oil sales man and guess what, most are not buying.

we want to hear from those who know what they are talking about, but then you don't get to play tough guy.  so you put on these as*hats instead.
5488 2018-11-28 17:12:52 if you want longer hair, mix castor oil into your hair products - there can’t say I never did anything for you all
5489 2018-11-28 17:12:46 But again, they no longer want to be beholden to unstable oil and gas prices. It's affecting everything in their supply chain. Gas prices go down, and SUV sales rise and people trade in sedans. Vice versa when prices skyrocket.They can't properly design or forecast on that
5490 2018-11-28 17:12:43 OBAMA HAD A WAR ON OIL PEOPLE ..WHY HE HAD EPA GO AFTER THEM
5491 2018-11-28 17:12:39 getting my oil change & light put in .
5492 2018-11-28 17:12:30 He did everything he could to stop drilling on government leases. Then tried to have tax incentives dropped that Bush had put in for oil companies drilling new wells.
5493 2018-11-28 17:12:29 PSA - do not put peppermint essential oil on your face
5494 2018-11-28 17:12:26 Jonathan devalued Naira in 2014 and in February 2015. These are facts. Oil price dropped further. If election had been held mid 2016, only people of Otuoke would have voted for Jonathan. He was just lucky to have got out before the oil price collapsed.
5495 2018-11-28 17:12:26 expecting yes now 50.0x... sorry boys it is not finished. Algo trade kicks  #oott #usoil #crudeoil #oil you cannot win against algo. it will kill your SL. You only know result . Lose all Win all game suddenly it happens
5496 2018-11-28 17:12:25 identity politics. lol nobody is talking about politics. FACTS is the discussion for the oil industry during the Obama years. if you are not talking about facts, then you are a racist
5497 2018-11-28 17:12:21 Normally I'm aware of all the stuff inside Nutella, chocolate etc., that is very harmful to my health and whenever I hear "palm oil", I feel like puking. But as soon as my period comes, my brain just shuts off its reasonable part and I'm like: give. me. my. choco. My pizza.
5498 2018-11-28 17:12:16 Yep, Obama restricts oil production, creates job killing policies, & shuts down oil pipe lines & production facilities, but now that President Trump has made America a strong competitor in the export of oil, Obama desperately tries to take credit...this guy is embarrassing!
5499 2018-11-28 17:12:16 Quelqu’un a déjà testé la CBD oil ici ? #cbdoil
5500 2018-11-28 17:12:00 Sorry but this plea is at least 25 yrs old -- I attended countless science-sponsored "cross pollination" events in Hollywood of scientists & filmmakers that end up as oil and water.  The question is what do you have that's NEW to solve this challenge?  I recommend the ABT.
5501 2018-11-28 17:11:55 Like Trump, bull shit! Low oil prices are good! #TrumpCrimeFamily #DemForce #Resistance #Resist 
5502 2018-11-28 17:11:54 As someone who was out of a job for over 2 years in the oil and gas industry due to HIS pollicies, this burns me. Ask him how many bankruptcies there were under HIS watch. I'll tell you. Between 2015 and 2016, there were 114 oil and gas companies that went into bankruptcy. (1)
5503 2018-11-28 17:11:50 2. Which is why there's been a surprisingly high number of climate change deniers among science fiction writers.  You'd think they'd be more inclined to trust scientists over oil executives but  their membership in the free market culture drives them down the rabbit hole
5504 2018-11-28 17:11:44 เอ๊ะทำไมเรารู้สึกผิดอะ งง
5505 2018-11-28 17:11:44 I wouldn't get a vaccine if you PAID me. Eat coconut oil. No more GMO's and processed food. And by GOD dont eat out of a can! Or PLASTICS! Totally toxic. And people wonder why...
5506 2018-11-28 17:11:38 Covers up a bit of the painting. I love old oil portraits.
5507 2018-11-28 17:11:35 If any of you think rural white folks won’t vote for their own layoffs in order to own the scary brown folks, you should maybe read up on your benighted cousins to the west.
5508 2018-11-28 17:11:35 They really out here putting motor oil on some cakes
5509 2018-11-28 17:11:25 @Hammad_Azhar which form/type of crude oil (brent) we import ... M1 or, M2, or M3, ...or M26?
5510 2018-11-28 17:11:23 First time getting oil change at mechanic smh feel soft
5511 2018-11-28 17:11:12 #oil so volatile loaded $cpg $4.12 maybe go long? Hmmm and $bte 2.34
5512 2018-11-28 17:11:03 As a guy who gets more than a little of his income from investment in oil, I know very well why prices are down, and the "why" they're down has absolutely nothing to do with the Govt. of Ontario or it's policies/actions. Enough with the B.S. and credit grabbing.
5513 2018-11-28 17:10:50 We heading back to the era of cheap oil lol which potentially is incoming gbese for Nigeria if the drop isn’t stopped.
5514 2018-11-28 17:10:43 Why am I not surprised who you support, do City have no foreign fans???your whole club is built on oil found in a foreign desert
5515 2018-11-28 17:10:42 @elonmusk Even when renewable energy becomes feasible, do you think we'll ever stop using oil? We've built billions of combustion engines and have the infrastructure to keep oil cheap and abundant.
5516 2018-11-28 17:10:39 There is no truth behind the $80 million/day narrative pushed by the oil industry and haplessly repeated by politicians @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley who are being hunted by them. It is an arbitrary doubling of a fact-free assertion by an oil sands investing bank. #cdnpoli
5517 2018-11-28 17:10:25 And people are idiots if they think any AK governor in their first two years has ANY effect on oil prices.  Or any time in their governorship.  Just a ridiculous story...
5518 2018-11-28 17:10:24 45 does not have a war on GM. The Kochs do. B4 the first recession GM introduced the Volt. It pissed off the Kochs, oil oligarchs. They drove the first recession. They're trying again. They control 45 with their partner Putin.
5519 2018-11-28 17:10:21 Jamaican black castor oil
5520 2018-11-28 17:10:19 I need a oil change
5521 2018-11-28 17:10:19 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that we have only 12 years to ward off an ecological disaster. How is big oil responding?  In Colorado, a drilling and fracking boom is happening in the middle of fast-growing suburbs. Other states have similar tales.
5522 2018-11-28 17:10:12 whats the health benefit? other than it being more healthy than vegetable oil
5523 2018-11-28 17:10:07 Olive oil?
5524 2018-11-28 17:10:04 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。

5526 2018-11-28 17:09:54 That's just crazy. She's the DIRECTOR of the CIA. Anything to protect big oil interests apparently..
5527 2018-11-28 17:09:53 That was you, no pipeline, no drilling,  heavy regulations. Take credit for the economy, now oil production. If it weren't for Trump you wouldn't have one damn thing to hang your hat on.
5528 2018-11-28 17:09:46 Heard you can use Virgin black seed oil (Habbatissaudah)
5529 2018-11-28 17:09:43 Obama just can’t stop lying. He hated the oil companies. Too busy funding Solyndra, etc.
5530 2018-11-28 17:09:38 Nope. We never used my car. And if we did he would fill my tank and get me oil changes
5531 2018-11-28 17:09:24 Marginal, Rick. If they cut production by a little, oil can climb a lot. That said, US frackers will adapt and the market will work.
Unless Democrat governments kill fracking as they keep trying to do.
5532 2018-11-28 17:09:17 Lol i don’t do much i wash my face with tea tree oil and that’s it 
5533 2018-11-28 17:09:15 I am glad to see the rest of the working world is catching up with Oil and Gas employment, getting laid off is part of having the job. Welcome to the global market folks.
5534 2018-11-28 17:09:02 American car manufacturers can't buy cheap steel to build cars because you've stuck tariffs on it all.

Maybe all the laid off GM workers can get jobs in steel mills? 

With kashoggi dead, do we need coal anymore? Or is oil ok now?
5535 2018-11-28 17:08:50 all i can see is that nasty motor oil on those waffles
5536 2018-11-28 17:08:45 If you don't know about economics then don't speak. Crude oil is raw material and 50 percent of petrol price. So if crude decline by 30 percent then petrol price will decline by half i.e. 15 %. This percentage is diffrent in all states.
5537 2018-11-28 17:08:39 That is very cool of you. And we know the sitting POTUS is shitbird. Maybe it's HIS dependence on oil making decisions for his pockets.
5538 2018-11-28 17:08:35 I would until I read about your palm oil usage. Expect your sales of Twirls to drop because I'm not buying them anymore.
5539 2018-11-28 17:08:34 Geesh what a complete fool. You have nothing to do with falling oil prices and everything to do Americans losing their jobs, healthcare and increasing a massive deficit. SAD
5540 2018-11-28 17:08:30 Disco Inferno was Bad, but him making fun of Konnan by saying “Oil of Olay!” was funny
5541 2018-11-28 17:08:20 Not that you’d know, you’re just a little manc who probably went for United before the oil money came in.
5542 2018-11-28 17:08:19 I truly believe the BP oil spill caused all those precious children on the gulf coast to get DIPG, an incredibly rare form of terminal brain cancer. If I have children they will never set foot in that poison water.
5543 2018-11-28 17:08:17 The reason ppl switched from whale oil to kerosene was purely because we ran out of whales to kill. Why do ppl destroy their credibility with nonsense?
5544 2018-11-28 17:08:16 Happy birthday bro.......Greater heights. Oil of ease!
5545 2018-11-28 17:08:12 Trial and error, I'm afraid. Only painting classes I ever took were in oil. I studied a lot of Alex Ross' technique, as the watercolor approach made more sense to me. I've only gone more opaque as I've gotten more confident.
5546 2018-11-28 17:08:01 i need help lol i bought that oil you told me about and my dark spots still there 
5547 2018-11-28 17:07:24 The attack of Pearl harbor was Japans's surprise attack attempting to annihilate America's navy. Japan intended to invade the pacific territories in order to gain access to pivotal resources like oil. #HIST125005F18
5548 2018-11-28 17:07:13 Lol. He was killing the oil industry with regulations....Thank the Lord for trump.
5549 2018-11-28 17:07:10 I am a robot. I piss oil
5550 2018-11-28 17:07:09 Lindy essentially means *stands the test of time*. The best predictor of the survivability of something, is how long it has already survived.
So oil like olive, mustard, they are Lindy. seed oil like sunflower, soybean aren't, so avoid the..
5551 2018-11-28 17:07:01 Fuck castor oil bro worst idea ever
5552 2018-11-28 17:06:58 You people will rub Goya oil on your face and come here and be shouting sun kissed. Is like you need slap.
5553 2018-11-28 17:06:57 @Oando_PLC 
* the name Oando was coined after the merging of Ocean and Oil with Agip Nigeria PLC in 2003.

*the core values of Oando are: Team work, Respect, Intergrity, passion and Professionalism 

*in 1956 Oando commenced operation as a petroleum marketing company
5554 2018-11-28 17:06:49 So you'll pay more in taxes to cover the decline in government revenue from the oil industry?  Your good with that?
5555 2018-11-28 17:06:44 i'm looking forward to seeing tony hayward in hell.  it's hotter than an ocean full of hot oil down here.
5556 2018-11-28 17:06:42 This should be fought at the Federal level but Trudeau along with side kick Butts would never allow. They want 'no oil " out of the ground.
5557 2018-11-28 17:06:30 Before you commit look at the video evidence. Kesler pulling Talbots pads apart, mcdavid goal against la thst was called, the 15+ in a row going against the Oil. Last night goal was just the tip of the iceberg.
5558 2018-11-28 17:06:30 GM gives money to politicians........just like the Oil companies........when they do it is a Campaign contribution.......when Tony Soprano does it, it is a Bribe
5559 2018-11-28 17:06:28 Venezuela’s fiscal breakeven oil price is $216 - TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN DOLLARS! 
5560 2018-11-28 17:06:27 Jai besoin dun bon oil treatment qui fait pousser mes chvx et les garde en santé pour lhiver!
5561 2018-11-28 17:06:26 is a natural remedy like cbd oil that you can use that’ll help you feel calm, I like to spray it on my pillow and around my room or just rub some on my wrists (and it smells good) but yeah you got this!!! Hope this helps and also happy belated birthday!!
5562 2018-11-28 17:06:24 Really? Shut down of coastal oil wells and Federal land grab of coastal waters, that contributed to an increase in oil production?
5563 2018-11-28 17:06:14 I'd rather see a climate scientist and a climate lawyer discuss the issue... or a disclosed oil industry executive and a climate scientist... Santorum is none of those.  Why Chris, Why?
5564 2018-11-28 17:06:12 He will never step up! This was all part of his campaign propaganda. He’s nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
5565 2018-11-28 17:06:08 He is such a liar, but the stupid Dems believe him.  The  crude oil production surge happened despite his administration,  President Obama coincidentally happened to enter office just as the shale oil boom in the U.S. was getting started and it was on private land. LIAR
5566 2018-11-28 17:06:07 I really hate siting to get a oil change now I gotta smell tires all day 
5567 2018-11-28 17:06:07 only if you can guarantee no palm oil
5568 2018-11-28 17:06:06 Why deny climate change? If the world ends, rich people die too. 3 options:
1. Oil companies understand less about science than ordinary citizens.
2. Oil companies want to end the world.
3. Climate change isn't real.
5569 2018-11-28 17:06:06 I feel like little girls dont need so much product in their hair. My hair grew just fine off some liv grease  & maybe some pink oil.
5570 2018-11-28 17:06:00 まだだ！！！！
5571 2018-11-28 17:05:58 you can thank big oil and fracking for that one
5572 2018-11-28 17:05:49 Yes, he should give us free oil for 1000 years.
5573 2018-11-28 17:05:48 That's why I buy mine from BP, that slick coat.. is just olive oil.
5574 2018-11-28 17:05:45 さんじ
5575 2018-11-28 17:05:42 Dear 0bama, I'm in the oil and gas service industry.  After your reign, we are lucky to still be in business.  We managed to stay afloat DESPITE you, not because of you.  Thank God for @realDonaldTrump .
5576 2018-11-28 17:05:39 There is one of the orangutan that I find particularly poignant. To me he looks fearful and almost hiding. I have it saved as a reminder of the fight for survival due to man & what we do to species for company profits..in this case palm oil.
5577 2018-11-28 17:05:38 I would kill corporate subsidies to all agree on that one man.Just get access to markets and let the best companies win.  Oil sends a pile of royalties, taxes, property taxes, GST, pst and pays strong wages that r heavily taxed. $30 to $40 million lost opportunity daily right now
5578 2018-11-28 17:05:33 @bobservo @hEnereyG As someone who grew up with purebred collies, I can confirm they are superdogs (or I was raised to think so). When my parents argued, ours would stand between them and me and bark at them. It was calm enough to let me and a friend cover it in suntan oil...
5579 2018-11-28 17:05:24 Yep, stopping that pipeline really got them to open up the oil spigot
5580 2018-11-28 17:05:21 Sure he did, he killed the oilfield here in south Louisiana and put tens of thousands of men and women out of work. Thank God for President Trump for getting rid of those stupid regulations that Obama put on the oil companies.
5581 2018-11-28 17:05:19 Oil is a dying industry.    Stop giving oil corporations billions of our money, when all they give Canada is a ruined landscape, billions in unfunded liabilities and climate change.   #cdnpoli #ableg
5582 2018-11-28 17:05:13 World's most successful gin salesman claims he "built that" oil industry.
No, Barry, you tried your best to KILL it.
5583 2018-11-28 17:05:04 I had no idea you had endo :/ Rant all you need bby girl. It’s an awful syndrome. Have you tried CBD oil? I wonder if that would offer some relief. In the meantime take it easy, maybe use a heating pad where you have pain.
5584 2018-11-28 17:04:54 I'd have thought you'd want our oil more? Since 40% of your imported oil is Canadian, (and prior to the tariffs most of you steel was Canadian as was your largest buyer of... well almost everything!)
5585 2018-11-28 17:04:53 Go on YouTube and find meditations geared towards anxiety/stress/worry, I do it when I’m anxious especially before bed and it helps a lot. It’s hard to concentrate when you first start to meditate but seriously I feel so much better after doing it. And also lavender essential oil
5586 2018-11-28 17:04:45 にじ
5587 2018-11-28 17:04:40 And if you like to clean oil from the kitchen roof and walls 
5588 2018-11-28 17:04:35 @algore did you see that @BarackObama is now claiming that he single-handedly undermined your initiative by making America the #1 oil producer in the world!

LOL. He gives pandering a bad name....
5589 2018-11-28 17:04:32 Jiffy lube really ripped me off for an oil change wow 
5590 2018-11-28 17:04:29 You must think we are really stupid. Tzeporah Berman was hired by you guys to quash the oil sands. The indigenous people wanted Northern Gateway it was already approved and you guys shut it down because you didn’t even fight for it.
5591 2018-11-28 17:04:27 I really liked those crackers until the company began putting preservatives and soybean oil in them.  Thanks alot.

5598 2018-11-28 17:03:54 Fuck gas money pay for my oil change.
5599 2018-11-28 17:03:48 Majority of increase in U.S. oil production occurred on private land. On land that U.S. government controls, it was a different story. The EIA reported in 2015 while U.S. oil & gas production was surging, production of natural gas on federal lands was declining.
5600 2018-11-28 17:03:45 What can you do to help solve the problem of #noisepollution? The best way to help is to pressure the government and the oil and gas industry to develop quieter methods.

5606 2018-11-28 17:03:24 Multiple people told me a spoonful of olive oil helps coughs a lot so I decided to record myself taking it on Snapchat expecting to make a weird face and I full on dry heaved and sent that shit anyway.
5607 2018-11-28 17:03:22 Update: The Michigan Senate will NOT vote today on committee-passed bill empowering the Mackinac Bridge Authority to oversee a tunnel that would house a new oil pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac #mileg
5608 2018-11-28 17:03:17 Time to go get my oil changed and then get told that I need to pay $1948282919573 on things that need to be fixed in my car

5610 2018-11-28 17:03:17 Justin Trudeau
When will you give a real, uh, speech, not full of, uh, scripted talking points and offer a detailed plan for getting, uh, Alberta oil to tidewater. I voted for you but am tired of your, uh, bullshit
5611 2018-11-28 17:03:16 Obama obstructed the Oil and Gas industry to the best of his ability. In that way, he made energy more expensive, which in turn increased development and thus production. So in that sense he is responsible, but it was due to his bumbling, and the exact opposite of his intention.

5613 2018-11-28 17:03:08 If you are planning on a surgery, it's important to stop taking fish oil pills for about a week before surgery. That is because fish oil can increase your risk of bleeding. Check in with your doctor before changing your medication routine.
5614 2018-11-28 17:02:57 Did you know that certain medications and supplements (like fish oil) can increase your risk of post-injection bruising? That's why is always important to share your entire list of medications with your doctor!

5622 2018-11-28 17:02:24 Interesting question asked of me in Norway: 
Q: "If CDN oil & gas industries are judged for both upstream and downstream impact, why aren't Canadian automotive and marijuana industries analyzed the same way? Isn't that hypocritical?"
My answer: "Good Question...."
5623 2018-11-28 17:02:17 Probably not.  Not if the establishment is still in charge.  It might have created a commission filled with oil barons.
5624 2018-11-28 17:02:15 First you have to know what oil his truck needs. Don’t just add any old oil. And then you climb up there and find the oil cap. It will say oil on it. Add a little bit and then close the cap turn the truck on then off and then check the dip stick and if it still needs more add mor

5626 2018-11-28 17:02:08 It won't last if Democrats get in charge. They'll ban fracking and oil exploration on public land. Leading to oil prices going up and imports going up. Making everything more expensive as the Us more beholden to foreign countries.
5627 2018-11-28 17:02:07 Whether it's oil, gasoline, natural gas, or coal it is all fossil fuels.

5632 2018-11-28 17:01:56 I'd like him a lot better if he would just have some balls and get a pipeline built. My son in law worked his ass off in the oil patch. Tomorrow his truck goes up for auction.Just another statistic. Shame Trudeau shame.
5633 2018-11-28 17:01:54 Bush did 9/11 and nobody is willing to admit it but me!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Dogs all have chips in their brain and spy for the government!
5634 2018-11-28 17:01:52 We have no credibility. Unlike China, which can roil the oil markets. We haven't learnt to project our power or to punish those who bother us. If Pakistan did 10% of what it did to us with China, they would be crushed back to the stone ages. Here, we can't even help our own KPs.
5635 2018-11-28 17:01:51 On my way to get an oil change and there’s go a flat
5636 2018-11-28 17:01:44 Not yet. We have to slash politicians’ salaries, increase productivity (depend on other products apart from crude oil to bring us money) and reduce our domestic and foreign debts.
5637 2018-11-28 17:01:41 Obama trying to take credit for USA oil production.
He's the one who shut down the pipeline and no drilling anywhere.  The loser knows he being shown for the street organizer that he is.
5638 2018-11-28 17:01:41 For now, yes. But the US automakers no longer want their vehicles beholden to the unstable price of oil. It affects the design, sales, ownership longevity, etc. Gas vehicles aren't going away at a finger snap, but it'll happen sorta quick. About 10 years with 5 year buffer.

5640 2018-11-28 17:01:38 Your opening statement speaks for itself. China is the largest coal burning country. Europe uses coal still and imports their oil from the rest of the world. Based on your logic, not sure why we would even consider catching up with them.

5645 2018-11-28 17:01:20 Welcome to Alberta when the economy is in the tank. Get ready for things to get really wild. Drug and alcohol abuse is rampant here when oil prices are down. I was finding needles all the time 15 years ago; nothing new. The Feds will never help with the AB Econ. It is what it is.

5650 2018-11-28 17:01:02 I need to get my oil changed.
5651 2018-11-28 17:01:02 2/2 U.S EIA inventories: U.S domestic production shows "no growth" for this week. Could be a sign that we are at the bottom for oil for the moment as drillers pause to see where oil goes before their own market entry. Low price could keep them out! @realDonaldTrump Taking credit?

5668 2018-11-28 16:59:55 conversations with my dad are long, winding roads that diverge into rants against capitalism (me) (its cruel and infectious) and wikipedia-like explanations of how things like olive oil are made (him) (they "steam the shit outta the olives")
5669 2018-11-28 16:59:53 @PressSec dear ms idiot. you know that to be data driven it would already have to HAPPEN.thus it is TO LATE to do anything. which is why YOU model to predict. NOT one study has been done for by oil companies to disprove it.NONE. where are YOUR studies?

5672 2018-11-28 16:59:44 He did everything he could to stifle domestic oil production! He over-extended moratoriums on drilling, provided federal protection for pipeline protests that trespassed on private lands, and delayed pipeline construction for years with endless environmental impact studies.

5675 2018-11-28 16:59:20 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
5676 2018-11-28 16:59:20 Nothing,I don’t wanna see Mfs strugglin in the cold. Mfs had to help a shorty today cuz she needed some oil
5677 2018-11-28 16:59:17 if oil companies are so independent, why are there so many former oil executives in cabinet positions, and why do oil companies contribute so much to political campaigns? it smacks of desperation to me.
5678 2018-11-28 16:59:11 Obama is slick as they come. No, the oil boom was due to President Trump. Nothing boomed during the Obama Presidency except our taxes!
5679 2018-11-28 16:59:10 That bad uh?  Aiyoo use aloe or any oils . Castor oil helps a lot
5680 2018-11-28 16:59:08 And in the muddied accounting, is refusal and inability to calculate the net INCREASE to total emissions through use of CO2 capture for Enhanced Oil RECOVERY. CCS is being used to get at more oil, not fewer emissions.
#skpoli
5681 2018-11-28 16:58:54 It was Fracking in private land. Oil output went up in spite of your best efforts not because of them.
5682 2018-11-28 16:58:42 It’s something trump had no business meddling in, it’s interconnective and complicated. Old oil will miss it’s obscene profit but the future of energy is already here. The new generation knows

5688 2018-11-28 16:58:19 Obama opened up the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, which was set aside in the 1920s when the US Navy moved from coal to oil.

Formerly Naval Petroleum Reserve #4. The first three have already been drained. Teapot Dome was center of a scandal during Harding Administration.

5694 2018-11-28 16:57:38 It matters greatly when we're providing oil, water, food and frontline troops.

Providing opinions though, that's a different matter.
5695 2018-11-28 16:57:37 Egypt's GASC: Bought 40,000 mt of Soyoil at today's tender. They paid $650.40/mt. They also bought 10,000 mt of sunflower oil at today's tender, paying a reported $673.00/mt.
5696 2018-11-28 16:57:27 Here’s how it works dimwit, use tariffs to raise the price of aluminum and steel and US producers can compete and grow. Demand the Saudis lower the price of oil we import and US producers shrink. Zero sum policy for jobs stupid.
5697 2018-11-28 16:57:22 We also need more refineries here since we now produce more oil than any other country and are selling it to them.

5709 2018-11-28 16:56:52 ExxonMobil already said that Pakistan have more oil reserves bigger than Kuwait near 5000 meters pak-iran border.
5710 2018-11-28 16:56:49 I'm constantly surprised at how little fields besides "computer stuff" know about source-control. e.g. otherwise high-tech oil company had no way to tell who (or what) got changed in their models (or when). Theoretically "Eye Tee" could provide yesterday's backups... 
5711 2018-11-28 16:56:42 
5712 2018-11-28 16:56:40 That pos shut down every oil drilling capability in the US. He wouldn't allow offshore drilling by Amercian companies but sold the rights to China & Keystone Pipeline still being held up by his admin. Obama is Public Enemy #1.

Fought drilling

Fought fracking

Over regulated energy

Promoted alternatives

Can’t name a thing he did to promote oil and natural gas

5750 2018-11-28 16:54:02 @marcmaron British roast potatoes. Peel. Cut to half tennis ball size. Simmer in hot water until they soften but not fall apart. Meanwhile put a deep tray with half inch of your favourite fat in a hot oven. Drain potatoes and tip them into the oil. Roast. Baste regularly.

5756 2018-11-28 16:53:14 I told them I left for Detroit two days earlier than I actually did. I actually drove to Illinois. Then my mom calls me like “your dad wants to take your car to get the oil changed” i woke up hella early! Drove 5 hours back just in time for them to get my car. I hate lying..
5757 2018-11-28 16:53:00 Well that and the fact that Saudi Arabia owns a large portion of the global oil supply, which would've drove oil prices through the fucking sky.
5758 2018-11-28 16:53:00 Let me guess your reply “...that is only 3 experts...they are paid by some oil company...they are wrong and I am right...Seth says I’m right so I am.”  Good luck to you Stevo. I’m done wasting time on this. Back to the lab I go!

5767 2018-11-28 16:52:02 Please, mention the possibility more often that these people are just lying & playing dumb about it to convince gullible Americans & profit from appeasing big oil donors and others who oppose climate change initiatives! Manipulative greed seems much more likely to me.
5768 2018-11-28 16:51:58 Obama shut down oil production!!!!!!!!!

He shut down ALL the rigs on the shelf in the Gulf leaving only the big company deep water rigs running to appease his contributors during his elections.

This guy lies so much he starts to beleive them.

5773 2018-11-28 16:51:49 His words don't even match someone who gets the credit. He sounds and looks dumbfounded that we could even be the world's biggest oil producer. There's an ignorance that comes threw as he speaks. It's because PTRUMP made it happen! He's trying to convince the fact. Obama STOP!

5781 2018-11-28 16:51:25 Nearly everything out of Obama's mouth is a lie. Where's the blaring headlines?

Also, to the extent there was a recovery during his administration, it happened b/c of Texas and oil, pulling it along. Conservative policies in a conservative state helped Obama despite him.
5782 2018-11-28 16:51:24 Again, why are we letting big oil companies pollute and dodge taxes? How is that helping Canadians?

5795 2018-11-28 16:50:51 Not a scam. Extra virgin olive oil means the oil which comes on first pressing of the olives. Has the most flavor and is least processed.

5801 2018-11-28 16:50:30 What a jackass.  #Obama did everything he could to restrict oil production. He refused to grant leases on federal land and offshore. He wanted to end fossil fuels. The oil boom was done by private citizens with new fracking techniques on private land.
5802 2018-11-28 16:50:29 Nissan stocks went down last week after Chairman arrested....but thats all a cover-up for real reason...running out of oil

5815 2018-11-28 16:48:54 It's unbelievable that Obama takes credit for everything and he did nothing. All he did was help the Arab countries build up their oil production and that's what will come out in history.
5816 2018-11-28 16:48:51 Yes of course and you have all of that North Sea oil revenue flooding in ! One simple question what % of your economy is reliant on the rest of the UK?
5817 2018-11-28 16:48:51 Unfortunately.... when President Bush started the Iraq war....The price for oil jumped and the need for cheeper economical cars was needed... America was into lg SUV and truck's then..we didn't learn...our tastes for these returned ..now GM motors has to regroup and go backwards?

5828 2018-11-28 16:48:10 As a non-renewable resource, if we want to continue to have access to Canadian oil in 2030 we will need to expand to replace lost production as existing fields end their useful lifespan
5829 2018-11-28 16:48:10 my skincare thread would be: sephora cleansing gel, coconut oil for make-up removal, a konjac sponge for exfoliation, and erborian cc cream whenever i go out and feel like doing something with my face lmao. i envy people who have skincare routines, mine lasted for like 6 months

5834 2018-11-28 16:47:31 And the other part is rick Simpson oil being needed to heal from disease or access to life saving treatments like #biomagnetictherapy that #insurance companies refuse to fund.

5837 2018-11-28 16:47:23 Obama is incredulous!

This guy did nothing for 8yrs except pass regulations, crippling our country. He declared war on coal & oil industries subsequently shutting down plants & production. 

Now he’s wants to rewrite his legacy & take credit 4 Trump reviving those industries. 
5838 2018-11-28 16:47:18 Solid with Venezuela and Saudis on buying their corrupt oil instead of buying our own as well. Quebecwill you please wake up.

5845 2018-11-28 16:46:47 U.S. oil production nearly doubled between 2009 & 2016. Natural gas production shot up around 50 percent in that time. BUT, the boom in production almost exclusively took place on state and private lands where the administration had little to no control.

5860 2018-11-28 16:45:08 Obama on Truth Serum: "Suddenly, when all my onerous regulations were removed, my dollar draining policies were reversed, and fossil fuel friendly deals were done, America is the largest oil producer and the worlds greatest economic engine; I'm gone... say thank you."
5861 2018-11-28 16:45:04 Ooh! Pretty!

5863 2018-11-28 16:44:59 @BarackObama did everything he could to stymie oil production.  We knew our potential.  We also knew that Obama was giving away the store Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil.  He lied while 8 yrs of office.  He'll continue to lie until the day he stops breathing.

5866 2018-11-28 16:44:48 Guys get hired doing grunt work at entry level pay in the oil field and act like they’ve been on the rig for 20+ years and I just don’t get it
5867 2018-11-28 16:44:47 Please explain this Obama.  You wanted to be the president that brought us green energy, but all along you were the president of more oil?
5868 2018-11-28 16:44:42 It's like a @StephenKing novel. As calamity accelerates and further horror looms, an evil powerful character uses his influence to drag more victims to their doom. There are the usual evil "helpers" (oil execs, politicians). Even the hysterically ridiculous dialogue would fit.

5874 2018-11-28 16:44:30 @jimgeraghty Re Obama and oil:  In the end, his Obama officials were torn because oil and gas had created more good-paying middle class jobs—directly and indirectly--than any other industry and their green industrial policy had principally benefited China.

5876 2018-11-28 16:44:24 The guy who killed the Keystone Pipeline? Let's translate for Obama, "Don't believe your lying eyes, dumb dumbs... I'm responsible for economic growth *AND* (apparently) oil, despite my anti-economic and anti-oil policies." Delusion is a hell of a drug.
5877 2018-11-28 16:44:18 @BarackObama ALSO STOOD IN WAY OF UPDATING REFINERIES - Our refineries can only refine sour crude (foreign oil!!) while our SWEET CRUDE (American Oil) has to go overseas!!! Screwed America again - - LIAR IN CHIEF - you can keep your doctor, your plan, Benghazi etc! Get real!

5880 2018-11-28 16:43:57 Industrial heat production is a key use case for Generation 4 nuclear plants. Heat generation from nuclear would be a benefit to both steam-based oil sands extraction and for water recycling. Great idea. Save natgas for home heating.

5886 2018-11-28 16:43:24 This lady talking bout the oil changes are moving along, wont be long at all...

Meanwhile my car still sitting here waiting to be taken in, and it's been almost an hour already.
5887 2018-11-28 16:43:18 Got some nice things for my birthday :D A beard set with shampoo, oil, wax, comb and scissors, for example. A retro console advent calendar and other stuff. i also put some christmas decorations up already earlier today. Oh no.
5888 2018-11-28 16:43:13 @dbongino So....Obama is taking credit for the 2018 economy (including oil production) and Hillary can't take credit for losing the election!!  My head is spinning. OMG I voted for her. I #walkedaway Nov 9th 2016.
5889 2018-11-28 16:43:10 Snake oil salesman.
5890 2018-11-28 16:43:08 My mom woke up with the mindset to wash windows and curtains. I need that type of oil.

5893 2018-11-28 16:43:02 Obama took credit for America’s oil?  Remember when cigarettes were good for you?  NOT TRUE EITHER
5894 2018-11-28 16:42:58 What is C8 MCT oil?
5895 2018-11-28 16:42:58 That cardboard and motor oil looking mad good 
5896 2018-11-28 16:42:56 Brazils minds are occupied by anger, and it's government is occupied by thieves..Why? Because an oil powered machine can run until all the trees are gone, all nature, all habitable land and drinkable water.. an oil powered engine does not need all that.. #maximizelife
5897 2018-11-28 16:42:53 Driving through oil country under the reign of Obama there was very little new holes being punched and the coal mines went dormant too. Many towns in the coal country had begun to look like a third world country. Now? The mines are open and Texas  is punching new holes too
5898 2018-11-28 16:42:47 Right right - but is it a structure fire?  Chemical?  Oil?  How unsafe is this smoke?  Who do we turn to for immediate answers?  Thanks for being on this beat
5899 2018-11-28 16:42:34 President "T" making it rain with his SPR barrels. Can't do that forever. As Prez T continues to exert anf exhaust all efforts to keep crude under pressured bottle, hurting U.S. producers, he will eventually run out of tricks and the cork will pop and oil prices will explode.
5900 2018-11-28 16:42:34 Some issues the oil biz faces like excessive regulation, royalties came at the hands of the provincial Cons, not NDP. But if UCP wins next election, Kenney’s buzzword politics will likely fail as he encounters same issues with natives, enviros, courts as those b4 him. #cdnpoli
5901 2018-11-28 16:42:33 Bonjour. Est ce que pour vous le granulé de bois est une réelle alternative au fioul pour le chauffage individuelle ?
5902 2018-11-28 16:42:25 America becoming the world's largest oil producer was not "because of" his policies, it was IN SPITE OF his policies.
5903 2018-11-28 16:42:25 YEAH RIGHT!!! @BarackObama - liar in chief stood in the way of oil production through his ENTIRE presidency! Stopped mining of lead, left us defenseless for bullets for war, put tight restrictions & taxed hell out of businesses - stymied the entire economy- GET REAL LIAR IN CHIEF
5904 2018-11-28 16:42:04 it would be funny if they weren't devoting such insane amounts of money and human suffering to creating this ridiculous advertising snake oil

5907 2018-11-28 16:41:54 "Progressives do, in fact, have a vision for foreign policy that attempts to uphold many values held by neoconservatives without resorting to military force, vaguely defines interests, and does not foresee security crises as a result of volatile oil markets when demand falls."
5908 2018-11-28 16:41:54 Midas straight up LIED 2 me... I was like hey mister I know this is dumb but I’m out of wiper fluid could u guys add some. N he was like YES MAAM that comes wit the oil change we did.... guess what their bitchasses DID NOT DO
5909 2018-11-28 16:41:48 I’m in class, dude told the teacher, “I’ll change ya oil if you give me a C” 
5910 2018-11-28 16:41:44 Good Lord, what an egomaniac!  He did all he could to suppress the Oil & Gas Industry and now taking credit for what he didn't do.  Kids out there - DON'T BECOME A POLITICIAN!
5911 2018-11-28 16:41:43 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.” (Hebrews 1:9 NIV)
5912 2018-11-28 16:41:41 I just tried one drop of oil of oregano and I think I’d rather be sick forever than ever try that again. Hopefully I feel better tomorrow
5913 2018-11-28 16:41:35 Respect their right to choice and opinion, you can't force someone down their throat, it's simple democracy, vote and support your candidate.
You mustn't insult them.
5914 2018-11-28 16:41:32 Venezuela has both private ownership and state intervention. In Norway some services/industries are nationalised (not just oil), but neither Venezuela nor Norway are socialist. Socialism is control of the means of production by the workers, and the abolition of private property.
5915 2018-11-28 16:41:25 China and India would purchase oil sands to refine in their own factories. It would no longer be a surplus.
5916 2018-11-28 16:41:15 By that I mean: spitting oil and how the house smells after.
5917 2018-11-28 16:41:12 There is NOT a #Texan I know that believes this statement from #Obama.

5919 2018-11-28 16:40:58 If there was oil production in the US, then my husband - who is an offshore oil (structural) engineer .. would be home; however, he's in Ghana (during Thanksgiving) .. where they are actually producing oil.  So .. not sure what the fk .. Obama is taking about.
5920 2018-11-28 16:40:57 Regular reminder that US shale is a light oil revolution but we will still need to import MBDs of heavy oil.

Mainly from Canada but Venezeula and KSA too
5921 2018-11-28 16:40:55 Why is the conversation about the GM move focused on jobs?  I’m more concerned about the discrepancy between cheap gas and the reality that oil is in steep decline.  GM is the canary folks!
5922 2018-11-28 16:40:55 Moroccan oil dry shampoo is the BEST!! You can buy it online but if you don’t wanna wait for it, try the Drybar dry shampoo you can get it at ulta. I use both but the Moroccan oil is my fav.

5944 2018-11-28 16:39:42 @HFI_Research How did US get flooded with extra 700kbpd of oil last week? We don't need Iran waivers if US is importing that much oil we don't need!
5945 2018-11-28 16:39:35 The whole canadian oil patch, its insane!
5946 2018-11-28 16:39:34 Nothing like a free hot oil massage 
5947 2018-11-28 16:39:24 Landlocked?  The USA buys 99% of our oil already so nothing changes except Alberta keeps $20 to $40 billion more in annual revenue for our own country.  Shows how blindly ignorant you are to Alberta.

5951 2018-11-28 16:39:10 The EIA reported in 2015 that while U.S. oil and gas production overall were surging, production of natural gas on federal lands was declining. Oil production is at about the same level as it was during his first year in office:
5952 2018-11-28 16:39:06 *killing humans* Oh... this coming from my eye? No, I'm... I'm not crying. That's... it's an oil leak. Just oil. J-just oil....
5953 2018-11-28 16:38:49 わらわに触るでない！不埒者！
5954 2018-11-28 16:38:48 President Obama coincidentally happened to enter office just as the shale oil boom in the U.S. was getting started.

In fact, the vast majority of the increase in U.S. oil production occurred on private land. On land that the U.S. government controls, it was a different story.
5955 2018-11-28 16:38:41 The oil market is global. Your prices are set by the marginal barrel. Saudis are a big factor in that. I am saying nothing about your other point. Just basic demand and supply
5956 2018-11-28 16:38:36 My mother uses CBD oil for sleep, as she has significant health issues. She hadn’t slept well for years. She does now. She indicated that it took some time to be effective (2 to 3 weeks), but this was consistent with the doctor’s prediction.

5960 2018-11-28 16:37:57 What a total dope! He only wanted the Arabs making bank on oil. He did everything he could to stop oil production in the U.S. and tried to permanently stop it in Alaska. This guy is 43.75% Arab and 6.25% African. He protected and gave billions to them when President. Wake up!

5968 2018-11-28 16:37:40 Well said Sarah.
A small comment, though. The gulf is surrounded by Arabic speaking nations. This includes Iranian side of Alahwaz region, overlooking the gulf & where most of Iran oil is, occupied by the Persians. As Trump called it before, the Arabian gulf, not Persian
5969 2018-11-28 16:37:39 Look at all that motor oil!
5970 2018-11-28 16:37:37 So @BarackObama is bragging about increasing oil production?So he is responsible for climate change?
5971 2018-11-28 16:37:19 No way Exxon is fine with 28. They must have said "they can survive" with oil at 28.
5972 2018-11-28 16:37:17 President Obama coincidentally happened to enter office just as the shale oil boom in the U.S. was getting started.

In fact, the vast majority of the increase in U.S. oil production occurred on private land. On land that the U.S. government controls, it was a different story.
5973 2018-11-28 16:37:16 He didn't build that.
8 years he blamed Bush for his crap economy, now for 8 years he'll steal credit from POTUS.
Obama did everything in his power to put oil/gas/coal industries out of business, regulated to the point of shutdown. Only the super big boys who donated $$ survived.
5974 2018-11-28 16:37:13 Me too, 36 years in Oil and Gas, Obama’s term was the worst.  But kicked of Federal land, did get us some good State lands production and much more on fee mineral so people got the money not the Federal government
5975 2018-11-28 16:37:09 えへへ
5976 2018-11-28 16:36:54 Yes, it did, but he strongly fought the Oil & Gas industry's every attempt to create that reality.

In other words, those increases happened not because of Obama, but IN SPITE OF him. There's clear evidence of his prevention of Keystone, anti-fracking, and other blocking policies
5977 2018-11-28 16:36:51 That's really rich…he crushed coal, held up the Keystone Pipeline, stopped drilling in the Gulf Of Mexico, and the oil companies developed fracking no thanks to him. With friends like that who needs enemies.
5978 2018-11-28 16:36:47 OK, thanks George! Savings on furnace oil are hit or miss though, and the company I deal with gets pretty exasperated with people expecting the price to go down.

5983 2018-11-28 16:36:28 Congressman, as 1 of your constituents I’m asking, will you sign the pledge for no fossil fuel money (oil, gas, coal or nuclear)? And will you cosponsor the Green New Deal? Perhaps OffFossilFuels? Please, we would really like to know!
5984 2018-11-28 16:36:28 I think there’s a couple of wrong assumptions here.  GERs is calculated using data from HMRC, ONS etc and from household survey, as well as data collected from e.g NS oil rigs.   This data is calculated by Statisticians who work for the Scottish Civil Service, not for SNP

5989 2018-11-28 16:36:14 I personally use CBD oil. It’s safe and organic! It has no THC and it’s even safe for animals at small doses. Plus it is so much safer then taking anxiety medication like Xanax or other opioids!

6022 2018-11-28 16:34:01 “If you hate it so much here [SW Louisiana, where I live], why don’t you move to California?”

Because unless you literally own an oil well, it’s almost impossible to make enough money here to move to a high-demand place like that!

6025 2018-11-28 16:33:58 @BarackObama AKA FORMER POTUS is delusional. Did he think we forgot about the pipelines that @realDonaldTrump authorized on taking office? Did we forget about ANWR in Alaska? Expansion of 
coal, oil, & gas and deregulations under Trump?

6031 2018-11-28 16:33:44 Keystone was from Canadian oil sands? Did Obama suffocate fracking, even though there were / are legitimate concerns about the environmental impact? No. Yet, you find a way to find fault? Lol!
6032 2018-11-28 16:33:39 I'm looking to buy a really nice aromatherapy diffuser for a Christmas gift (I'm doing someone else's shopping). Something classy-looking that's also high-quality and works well. Does anybody have any recommendations for a diffuser and/or fabulous oil blends?
6033 2018-11-28 16:33:38 The growth of trade year on year means #shipping grows quickly and so we need radical changes to decarbonise fuel, creating big changes in an oil driven economy. This is a chance for UK regulation not just IMO says @tristanps #netzero
6034 2018-11-28 16:33:38 BTW I supply quality red oil and beans. Am just a dm away.

6036 2018-11-28 16:33:34 The only oil Obama had anything to do with was the KY Putin put on. 
6037 2018-11-28 16:33:30 All the comparisons I've seen on this app are purely ignorant. our problems are peculiar to us because of our population, culture, beliefs, economy, and our system in general.
Nobody puts any of those into consideration when bashing Nigeria.

6041 2018-11-28 16:33:12 He also blocked all drilling on all federally owned lands.  In short, he did everything he could within his power to block the shale oil and gas revolution.  It continued on despite him, not because of him.

What hubris to now be claiming credit.
6042 2018-11-28 16:33:03 You do know that AB gets the same royalty money regardless of who owns it right?  AB owns the oil and the companies pay the royalty to extract it.

6055 2018-11-28 16:32:08 So then why is CNN putting on climate deniers pundits that are saying scientists are receiving money without letting the public know that these same pundits are getting money from the oil&gas industry? CNN needs to be transparent. This is too important an issue.

6064 2018-11-28 16:31:39 is there a life hack to open @TheBodyShop's oil bottles

6068 2018-11-28 16:31:27 Ummm so wait a sec...he shut down more oil wells by not renewing their paperwork (approving them to drill in and around our nation especially in the gulf)..he blocks the pipeline from US to Canada(not to mention shuts down coal w/his insane carbon crap) & we're to say thank you?

He's not Yemen.
6073 2018-11-28 16:30:42 But some genuine comparison awakens the mind of our leaders to do the right things and some patriotic citizens.
Nevertheless most critiques makes it look as if there's nothing good in Nigeria hence making others ridicule and look down on us,giving fake statistics without research
6074 2018-11-28 16:30:38 I would add, it's been reported that Erdogan's son, an oil exec, was purchasing truck trains of Iraqi oil from ISIS. Not one MSM source covered it, Obama hid it well.
6075 2018-11-28 16:30:38 We dont want north Korea to build more nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia yo kill journalist. Russia to hack our voting and democracy ripped apart.

6085 2018-11-28 16:30:13 Nutella has milk in it therefore it is not Vegan so I'm not sure where you got your info about it being staple vegan food. Most vegans are environmentally conscious and actively avoid Palm oil.

6088 2018-11-28 16:30:10 If Ksh is overvalued as IMF say by 18%, market expect it at Ksh120, with rising oil prices there will be a vicious cycle of debt spiralling out of control, however this overvaluation is hurting exportation which bring in dollars needed to repay the same debt hence the conundrum.

6102 2018-11-28 16:28:46 ''when your footprint ..." Rolling back laws and regulations is the issue. Has any welfare corporation done anything to provide oil free options to the average citizen?! Nope, why is that? They really would rather have $$ than care about the next 7 generations.

6105 2018-11-28 16:28:29 Concise chart. Give the refinery runs some time to work. Fair price for oil is low 60s for WTI, High 60s for Brent. US production only coming down from  here with $50 and Midland differentials.
6106 2018-11-28 16:28:29 3.5 million barrels of oil surplus. GM shuttering 44 plants. WTI teetering on going below $50 @ barrel.Oil Oligarchs are sweating. Winters predicted to be shorter. Less heating oil to be sold.

6126 2018-11-28 16:27:20 Your government is the government of gay and vampires. Biafra oil in Nigeria is drying up fast and canary wharf will be no more because of evil conspiracy against the indigenous people who owns the resources that feed Britain. How can Africa forget your atrocities?
6127 2018-11-28 16:27:09 The problem with being androgynous is that you’re constantly misgendered, the perk is when you’re getting your oil changed they will speak to you like you know what they’re talking about.

6155 2018-11-28 16:25:08 Ah didnt see that. Why are the Oil so bad with so many GMs and Coaches? Its actually amazing. Is it Katz and his old boys club hard on? It must be. They need to hire a good GM and give him or her full autonomy.

6158 2018-11-28 16:25:02 Be sure to change your separator element every 2,000-8,000 hours of use (depending upon make and model of the compressor) and prevents excessive oil usage. Analysis has shown that compressor energy costs rise by 1% for each 2 PSI of separator pressure drop.
6159 2018-11-28 16:24:58 Expecting Google or Facebook to respect privacy is like expecting Exxon Mobil to respect the environment. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of their business. Google and Facebook exist to extract and exploit data just as Exxon Mobil exists to extract and exploit oil.
6160 2018-11-28 16:24:55 Neil, despite stocks, you have signs that demand is very strong domestically - specially for hydrous ethanol at the pump. On the other hand, weakened oil prices could limit consumption ...

6163 2018-11-28 16:24:48 Jancovici est membre de l’Aspo, donc peakiste. Et un des meilleurs ingénieurs français sur la double problématique climat / Peak oil. Donc quelque soit son salaire, c’est une bonne nouvelle qu’il en soit membre.

6166 2018-11-28 16:24:37 FYI - the Liberals bought a pipeline to ship oil from Alberta! Huge commitment to Alberta! TM will be builtLet that sink in 
6167 2018-11-28 16:24:26 In contrast to England?
 I think not. Scotland has oil and gas, whisky, fish, water, premium food and drink products, agriculture and forestry, expertise in the digital economy, textiles, renewable energy, financial services. Other small countries are doing well without all this.
6168 2018-11-28 16:24:24 Ask *anybody* who works in the oil industry about how ludicrous this statement is.

And every daggum bluecheckmark in my feed here would have been RTing this with wildly over-the-top snark if it had been Donald Freaking Trump making a claim this preposterous.
6169 2018-11-28 16:24:19 Bush said Iraqi oil would pay for the war. 17 years later the war has cost taxpayers 6 trillion dollars, $65 billion/yr just for oil to drive around. GM is the least of gov waste. 360k jobs saved w/70k each to spend on gdp, VS 360k unemployment checks?

6178 2018-11-28 16:23:48 Alberta does not need to be a victim of Ottawa in general. Let us re-read the BNA, and what lead to Alberta joining Canada, what we actually agreed to, and if the people who supported making our oil the de-facto property of Ottawa were working in Alberta's best interest.

6181 2018-11-28 16:23:38 so if you have the facts to the oil industry when obama was in office  and you are still entertaining lies, then thats all there is. the mans skin color.
6182 2018-11-28 16:23:38 “I’m here for an oil change”                                Sorry is that a turbo, I can’t work on this
6183 2018-11-28 16:23:37 Hey genius your hero Barack  o boo boo is claiming new oil finds are result of his administration. Looks like betrayal to me green boy.
6184 2018-11-28 16:23:34 its that time of year where I just want to bathe in olive oil so that my skin doesnt turn to the texture of burnt cardboard

6186 2018-11-28 16:23:29 Hey Obama Administration let me remind you! In case you have forgotten “You did not build that” you placed 22,000 job killing regulations on American business and the oil,gas and coal industry! You were for the Paris Accord would have destroyed US energy!
6187 2018-11-28 16:23:29 I had a headache and my coworker said here try rubbing this essential oil on your head. I did (with a crazy look on my face) AND it worked.
6188 2018-11-28 16:23:24 I actually like what you are doing to the auto industry. Can you do it to big Oil next?
6189 2018-11-28 16:23:20 @DELv2 @The_Raheel @johngranato “I can’t make games during the week because I have to get the oil changed in my BMW, stop at Whole Foods for groceries, get home to little Asher so Consuela can go home, and go to the gym.  It’s tough.” -Texan Gretchen
6190 2018-11-28 16:23:18 You can't go lower, you've already dragged us to rock bottom. 
In case you missed that, I wasn't talking about oil prices.
6191 2018-11-28 16:23:15 Maybe because the TV networks get lots of money from fossil fuel corporations and other war profiteers?  Remember "Frau Frack"?  "Do you OWN an oil company? You do if you have a 401K"..

6206 2018-11-28 16:22:10 He was against production of oil. He is a member of the » green religion »Another Hillary, he thinks that nobody is better than him!

6212 2018-11-28 16:21:45  He tried everything he could to stop oil production, regulations, lawsuits and designating areas as some sort of reserve. We were lucky the North Dakota oil was on private land, and he couldn't touch it.
6213 2018-11-28 16:21:42 I have super dry skin too! This is what I’ve been using that seem to be working for me. I use the farsáli rose gold beauty oil as a primer and for foundation I mix the Maybelline Fit Me dewy foundation with wet and wild photo focus and NYX dewy setting spray. Hope this helps!
6214 2018-11-28 16:21:41 OMG!  Obama hated oil production in USA, and stymied it whenever he could.  He has jumped the shark.
6215 2018-11-28 16:21:40 They are playing zap that Heid. 
6216 2018-11-28 16:21:38 Was Max in the Streets of Quebec saying we should burn western oil? We need Pipelines! He sat complacent like all in the east have for decades burning billions in foreign oil! Supporting Eastern Elites who profit from tankers and distribution! F the West right who the F are they!

6220 2018-11-28 16:21:04 Keep your enemies close. Useful  tools. Great hedge with Israel against the mullahs/Turkey/Pakistan. Plus we signed the deal with them long ago to sell their oil in dollars.

6222 2018-11-28 16:21:02 #UJO read through the objections, as previously, little to do with the facts. It's an anti fracking/ environment issue. Note the quote re global warming ffs!  Its #NotFracking

I suggest locally sourced oil will impact the environment less than oil shipped from the middle east?

6225 2018-11-28 16:20:40 I had a third party curse me out cuz we had the wrong number and then when I apologized, thanked him for telling me and advised I was removing it he WENT. OFF. dropping f bombs like I had struck oil. I could see why his wife left him.
6226 2018-11-28 16:20:34 Way worse. But someone had to know that trick. Now we do. No one would want to pour motor oil on pancakes. We will all be alright.
6227 2018-11-28 16:20:29 Yes, I agree. For some reason I don’t think we’re there yet and our reliance on oil as the current energy source will have to continue for some time. But it is critical that we must move in a different direction and invest in alternative fuel sources...
6228 2018-11-28 16:20:29 Mtn snitch ??
6229 2018-11-28 16:20:25 Two weeks ago the @AlbertaParty called for a short-term curtailment of oil production to keep Albertans working and increase the take for the resource we all own. Today, Encana founder Gwyn Morgan joined the call. Why no action from the NDP? #ableg

6239 2018-11-28 16:19:55 Don, why are you constantly talking about how great tariffs are and then granting businesses waivers? Like steel and aluminum from China. It reminds me of the sanctions imposed on Iran. You demanded that countries stop importing Iranian oil and then gave out waivers. Waz up?

6242 2018-11-28 16:19:39 the prior recession to the "housing market crash" was the "tech bubble crash" in 2001 and then prior the "90s oil price shock" and prior "the energy crisis" in the mid-late seventies.

everything is sensationalized as an anomaly when its all just repeatable, predictable events.

However, if the silver price trends lower to $10, which I highly doubt, then it would destroy a large % of Primary Silver Miners

6251 2018-11-28 16:19:03 No actual oil was involved as you can't put oil in buses, they (TFL) just gave them money & bought from others. The offer back to Caracas on city planning I believe went nowhere.

6273 2018-11-28 16:17:35 #Obama is without a doubt the most delusional ex president I’ve ever seen. His policies were anti oil expansion, imposed higher taxes on oil development.  Refused to open Anwar. I would say, what a liar… But that would be an oxymoron. His entire existence is a Lie. #GoAway
6274 2018-11-28 16:17:33 And still, it’s up to Alberta to get off oil?!?  Tell me.  Are you riding your peddle bike absolutely everywhere?

6276 2018-11-28 16:17:30 This is the same guy who said you like your dr., you keep your dr. & countless other lies.  The only reason oil production increased during his tenure was due to fracking on privately owned land.  He couldn't stop that, but he would have done so if he could. @BarackObama go away!

6286 2018-11-28 16:16:20 Hey, doesn’t matter if you can actually produce it and use, you know, oil.
6287 2018-11-28 16:16:13 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
6288 2018-11-28 16:16:12 I'm so glad your mom saved you with eagle oil!

6292 2018-11-28 16:15:39 And how much oil is produced off the Virginia coast?
6293 2018-11-28 16:15:37 Ina Lagos yanxu , but maybe Before elections InshaAllah
6294 2018-11-28 16:15:33 at this rate oil likely will break 50 level if the output cut is delayed #WTI
6295 2018-11-28 16:15:30 Normal to oily. Pertama bersihin muka make baby oil terus make cleansing milk sari ayu yg mawar. Next fw Wardah perfect bright. Toner sariayu. Serum wardah purifying. Terus bobo

6298 2018-11-28 16:15:19 Not true. Under Obama the fracking boom exploded resulting in a surge of American oil. Obama didn’t start fracking but what ever happens under a president’s watch he gets either the credit or blame.  In this case Obama gets the credit.
6299 2018-11-28 16:15:11 Pelosi statement.....  after chewing dentures,,,,,," if if if aaahhhaa  you know,  ahhh Supena Power,,  Bush-Cheney,, so ahhh  Trump Oil,,,,  heeheeee,,,  bye bye" "House Democrats"
6300 2018-11-28 16:15:11 They are all liars, masses don't know the price of a barrel of oil and I don't know why they are writing about it as if they are working and the fall in price want to hinder their good job.
6301 2018-11-28 16:15:10 Use witch hazel on cotton rounds for 10-15 mins or massage coconut oil under your eyes and leave it on overnight.

6310 2018-11-28 16:14:06 What is more concerning is the impending doom of election. The right is divided. The Conservatives must commit to closing borders, disassociating from UN, spur investment in refining Canadian oil, scrap Carbon taxation and significantly reduce government. #trudeaulyuseless
6311 2018-11-28 16:14:06 The ST have become oil on canvas they are simply stunning
6312 2018-11-28 16:14:02 A few years ago this happened on my street. Somehow the car ended up covered in used motor oil. When the police showed up an hour later, they had a chuckle before towing the car off to an impound lot.
6313 2018-11-28 16:13:57 literally the this was my mom the first month i was diagnosed w leukemia lmaooo she made me drink eagle oil and rubbed it on my temples
6314 2018-11-28 16:13:52 Charity starts at home you Hypocrite. Start giving your stuff to a black family today. I'm sure you must know at least one black person in need? You think you are selling something to the black community right now but they see you as the SNAKE oil you are. Pathetic and comical.
6315 2018-11-28 16:13:36 the people who elected this guy are also manipulated by midias against the main left party of Brazil, PT represented by Lula, ex-president & that now is a political prisionier. it's a plan to sale brazilian natural resources (oil, niobium, etc.) and set Brazil as backyard of USA.
6316 2018-11-28 16:13:33 I tweeted a vid showing how in still life photo they use motor oil for syrup or shaving cream for whipped cream - cursed
6317 2018-11-28 16:13:32 Veggie cooked in vegetable oil which causes heart diseases and diabetes, lack of any substantial source of protein in diet. 
Thats a starter for being out of line.

6319 2018-11-28 16:13:19 Handy for who? Ukgov take 92% of revenue for oil. Loss of fiscal transfer?
6320 2018-11-28 16:13:17 Yeah..Anti Frak..anti coal..anti oil..anti off-shore..Tax Em' All Higher..Barack Obama..U Da' Man..!
6321 2018-11-28 16:13:12 idk the last time i had a oil change , it crank so ..
6322 2018-11-28 16:13:11 Thing is... He really is this stupid. The fact that he sold snake oil to a lot of voters does not make him smart - it just means trump targeting people more stupid than he is. I mean, a smart president probably wouldn't have ever hired Manafort to begin with...
6323 2018-11-28 16:13:04 How often are you having your oil tank maintenanced? If there is noticeable rust or damage; call us asap.

6325 2018-11-28 16:12:57 These cooking tips are incredible! Motor oil is so much cheaper than syrup—just think of the long-term savings my family will earn!

6327 2018-11-28 16:12:47 Danielle Pletka of American Enteprise Institute, an organization paid for by “Big Oil”, was on NBC Meet the Press. She spoke on climate change, mostly against it, idiotically, then informed everyone she is not a scientist, just a citizen. 

Opinion: Get the fcuk out of here!!!
6328 2018-11-28 16:12:46 the Fed may start shifting uncomfortably in their seats at prospect that we synchronous slowdown in construction, manufacturing, oil/gas, and (maybe) capital formations in first couple of quarters of 2019.
6329 2018-11-28 16:12:46 on dat chili oil drip 
6330 2018-11-28 16:12:46 Have you ever met any climate scientists? Maybe you should consider what experts have to say instead of basing your beliefs on what oil lobbyists tell you to believe.
6331 2018-11-28 16:12:44 Thanks to all those that opposed Obama administration’s efforts to restrict oil development.
6332 2018-11-28 16:12:41 They are keeping the deal the Drumpfs security of his orders to hit on Khashoggi knew too much between Drumpf and the so-called King Prince of Saudi Arabia big oil deals!! That Kills electric cars??

6335 2018-11-28 16:12:31 oil prospered despite your attempts to shut it down.  notice all drilling is done on PRIVATE land not government owned land.
6336 2018-11-28 16:12:30 There is no specific policy Obama did to increase oil production in the US. Can you list on policy from Obama that he made America Largest Oil producer?
6337 2018-11-28 16:12:29 Visiting an oil rig? Norway? Denmark? Nope.. I'm out.
6338 2018-11-28 16:12:22 @POTUS.  LOW OIL PRICE HURTING U.S. Oil Businesses and oil related JOBS. Stop bashing oil prices DOWN.
6339 2018-11-28 16:12:22 #ArgusMedia held a mock (practice) session this morning for the #ArgusOpenMarkets screen for Mediterranean and northwest European #bitumen cargoes. Oil refiners, major trading firms and construction companies took part. The #AOM goes live on Monday, 10 December.
6340 2018-11-28 16:12:20 I'm a big Drai fan. Which is why I tire of comments within Oil Country denigrating his motivation & character. No doubt sometimes I am overreacting, including this morning 
6341 2018-11-28 16:12:18 We hope you enjoy this wonderful oil!

6343 2018-11-28 16:12:14 We only get 11% of our oil from the Saudis, you do not think that 11% could be easily replaced?  That is nothing.  And Iran was minding it's own business before Bolton rattled their cage.
6344 2018-11-28 16:11:58 Just keeps inching up against oil and all this uncertainty make no sense
6345 2018-11-28 16:11:44 ES/SPY didnt blink when oil dropped after the number..lower oil seems to be priced in now..means higher oil a plus
6346 2018-11-28 16:11:43 Show your work, son. Where’s the report that backs up the idea that the scientific community is overwhelmingly liberal? Does that include the ones that work for the Koch Bros and oil companies?
6347 2018-11-28 16:11:40 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
6348 2018-11-28 16:11:36 yeah, god forbid we want to prevent an oil spill close to land or fishing areas.
6349 2018-11-28 16:11:35 This chocolate is full of palm oil...avoid like the plague and buy decent chocolate made with sustainable ingredients
6350 2018-11-28 16:11:19 Did all he could to stop Oil production in the U.S.  Doesn't anyone remember the Keystone Pipeline?  Off-Shore Oil Leases not being renewed?  Worst President in my life time (and that includes economy killer Jimmy Carter).
6351 2018-11-28 16:11:08 It wasn’t better under Obama. It just got less attention.

He was looking into selling off naming rights on the national parks. Like a sports stadium

He also sold off a ton of oil & gas permits in his last year of office.

It’s all about money. Party doesn’t matter. Look at DAPL
6352 2018-11-28 16:11:00 Feds Order Taylor Energy to Clean Up or Pay Up for Oil Spill in Gulf

6354 2018-11-28 16:10:54 I guess he thinks HE built it. Who was against the pipelines? Obama. Who would have shut down shale oil facilities if he could have, Obama. Just go away, Mr. Ex-President.
6355 2018-11-28 16:10:53 Tremendous potential. Maybe they'll be brought great distances. Yes, they control because they took the oil. The American People.
6356 2018-11-28 16:10:53 I got you but idk measurements, I eyeball it lol. Cornmeal, flour, baking powder, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, one egg, butter/oil, milk and a medium roasted sweet potato!
6357 2018-11-28 16:10:51 Kinda interesting considering fracking is the final dregs of whats left. (15yrs max supply) The only major oil field left is under antarctica and is almost totally dominated by russia. (U.s. doesnt have the ice breakers) yet u.s. troops have been training for combat there. Favors
6358 2018-11-28 16:10:49 Not to mention the loss of tax revenues and royalties from oil. People just don’t get this. Just give it some time. When they wake up they’ll blame Harper. 
It’s been said many times but you really can’t fix stupid.
6359 2018-11-28 16:10:34 Wait, I thought oil was bad...?

6362 2018-11-28 16:10:29 Ditch the seed oils (that includes most commercial mayo and sauces), cook w/ animal fat, olive or coconut oil. Throw in some sardines or mackerel and you'll be fine.
6363 2018-11-28 16:10:28 Dunno if you have access to CBD oil or not but if you do go get some. It’s really good on inflammation. Some yoga + CBD would probably do you real good.

6377 2018-11-28 16:09:25 only a complete racist would write this. for someone who was actually working in the Permian Basin, we all know that Saudi Arabia putting millions of barrels of oil on the market to try and crush the shale drilling in america was the reason for the collapse.

6383 2018-11-28 16:09:12 1) Climate change is 100% real.
2) If Climate Change was 100% false burning carbon poisons our air/food/water & costs us billions in damages every year.
3) Renewable energy is basically free. Once you buy solar panels you don't pay for every gallon of oil.
4) Carbon will run out.

6385 2018-11-28 16:08:57 How long did 3 day week last?
The effect was that from 1 January until 7 March 1974 (also same month the 1973-74 oil crisis ended) commercial users of electricity were limited to three consecutive days' consumption each week and prohibited from working longer hours on those days.
6386 2018-11-28 16:08:57 @WtiOil Oil prices must go up. This low price is hurting U.S. Oil Production Businesses, and JOBS. ABOUT TIME @POTUS MUST STOP BASHING OIL PRICES DOWN. LOW OIL PRICE = MORE POLUTION.
6387 2018-11-28 16:08:55 He is trying to convince himself but he did everything to destroy the oil industry but if you are paying attention to facts that liberals don’t use...Trump is awesome
6388 2018-11-28 16:08:45 . .. OK.. I guess there's some truth to a break in period.. But if a new vehicle continues to consume oil after break in?

6395 2018-11-28 16:08:21 My supplier decarbs it himself, and his method depending on the intended usage of the oil only needs me to bake it to activate.

medium sized bowl:

Put olive oil on every leaf and mix with seasoning. Spread out a single layer of kale on a baking sheet and bake 30 min, turning trays half way. 
Stay crispy!!

6403 2018-11-28 16:07:53 Since the dawn of oil in Alberta, the province has refused to really diversify into anything else. I believe within 10 years oil will be on the way out the door. Young people need to look at other avenues for long term employment. Solar and wind come to mind.

6414 2018-11-28 16:06:58 I don’t think low oil prices is something I’m going to spend time worrying about. I’m also wondering when they will start because gas is close to $3.00 a gallon here.
6415 2018-11-28 16:06:57 Because he hasn't fixed the rotation problem. If your engine is failing you don't give it an oil change, you fix the engine then the oil change comes with the fix.

6433 2018-11-28 16:05:31 Let them complain.... at least we are seeing the evidence of the free will offerings, tithe and donations. All the taxes and oil revenue with their govt nko? We are not seeing it. Please , let haters (including daddy freeze) go and hug transformer.
6434 2018-11-28 16:05:31 Nationalize like Venezuela? Yeah that turned out well for them didn't it? There are not enough sun days and windy areas in the country for alternatives, so what do you do? Why is oil so bad if used efficiently?
6435 2018-11-28 16:05:29 @algore: more BS lies:
6)Overpopulation would result in worldwide famine.
7)We would deplete our natural resources.
8)We would run out of oil.
9)The polar ice caps would melt.
10) Manhattan would be underwater!

6438 2018-11-28 16:05:07 Are there any long term aspirations concerning a conversion to 100 % green energy, as supposed to the continual use of oil? :)
6439 2018-11-28 16:05:06 Yes. Whatever deregulation has taken place is not yet been implemented because of lawsuits and not enough time to develop new oil sources. It takes multiple years to develop an oil source. Also, production effect is overrated as refining production has more impact on fuel prices

6444 2018-11-28 16:04:57 Yeah or Holy oil fire. Dean Jokes about deep frying me, but I’d rather die.
6445 2018-11-28 16:04:50 from @jimgeraghty, Obama: “Suddenly, America is the largest oil producer . . . That was me, people . . . What are you complaining about? Just say, ‘thank you,’ please.” To quote a popular phrase from a few years back . . . “You didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”
6446 2018-11-28 16:04:35 Been waiting at a mechanics for over 2 hours to get a simple oil change (after being told I’d only have to wait an hour) and now Wendy Williams is on the TV and idk what I did to deserve this torture today
6447 2018-11-28 16:04:31 Yes I remember when he blocked the Keystone pipeline. He said “It’s dirty oil”
6448 2018-11-28 16:04:31 Or how about that the Koch bros and other oil industry leaders are directly behind the anti-cc/gw "research?"

6452 2018-11-28 16:03:56 @getjackblack Why did you discontinue the Clean Boost toner?! It's my & my husband's favorite toner. Your new Oil Control toner is getting terrible reviews & isn't even a similar skincare issue (ie. it ends up leaving another gap in the product line) so the change is perplexing.
6453 2018-11-28 16:03:54 You might think that I have typed "oil-by-rail" enough for my iPhone not to autocorrect it to "oil-by-Raul", but you'd be wrong. #oott

6458 2018-11-28 16:03:42 I think you may be referring to oil since this chart was XLE but I agree with you on oil definitely not looking anywhere close to 70 yet and lots of work to do in between. That 56.55 fib you mentioned is also a key area for me, could get bullish if it clears there
6459 2018-11-28 16:03:40 He wanted us to be completely dependant on Islamic oil, I figured that out long ago.
6460 2018-11-28 16:03:36 Last time we were at $40 oil and shale was struggling to find investors and on the verge of collapse they promised they would return value to shareholders and change their ways, instead the destruction continues as they continue to pump themselves into bankruptcy. 1/2
6461 2018-11-28 16:03:33 Putin's Russia has always been an aggressor independently of the price of oil. It would be an understatement to associate Russia's latest aggression against Ukraine merely to this.

6470 2018-11-28 16:03:01 Hello - thanks for getting in touch. Sorry for the late reply. We don't have any palm oil in our Kitchen, although it is a sub-ingrediant in a few ingrediants we use (but we do make sure it's RSPO certified). We're working with our suppliers to eliminate it entirely.
6471 2018-11-28 16:03:01 Not everything has to be all or nothing not everything has to be destroy the earth or don’t  produce oil. This is the problem with politics and tribalism. Because he didn’t want to destroy pristine land then he didn’t promote oil? Get real
6472 2018-11-28 16:03:00 What kind of self-delusional bunny hole does this idiot live in? He did everything in his power to destroy oil production in America because 'global-warming'.

6490 2018-11-28 16:01:29 He blames oil production for negative effects to global warming, yet here now a Democrat (and former President) champions himself as being responsible for America as the largest oil producer. 

This is why man-made global warming skeptics exist.
6491 2018-11-28 16:01:25 Even anecdotally, seeing tech firms referring to them as Big Oil or Robber Barons, there’s bigger concern
6492 2018-11-28 16:01:22 U.S. oil production has grown each year to reach 9.4 million bpd in 2015 -- a gain of 88% during Obama's presidency. This is in fact the largest domestic oil production increase during any presidency in U.S. history.  FACTS MATTER if u can get past he's black lol

6519 2018-11-28 15:59:41 Haha.  He ended all oil production on federal land lucky for us he wasn't able to stop it on private land and the "evil" oil companies invested tons of money into that field.

6525 2018-11-28 15:59:23 Now you've started something. In the #CorbynistChanukah the oil came from Babylonian oil wells and the Greeks were unarmed, underaged freedom fighters.

6534 2018-11-28 15:58:47 Sure, that's anything. The question is how much does it cost you to get a car to 200K+ miles? My Honda is near 140K, I've spent $15 on a gallon of coolant, $10 for gear oil, $10 for a belt, $25 on spark plugs and $85 on brakes. DIY of course and oil/tires. Good for another 140K.
6535 2018-11-28 15:58:34 Yeah, i think it basically uses olive oil as the fat instead of butter. It's shockingly good and not as overwhelming as it sounds.

6546 2018-11-28 15:57:54 US oil production nearly doubled from 2009 to 2016 while Obama was in office. Production of natural gas increased by 50% during that time period. Obama took credit for this. What he didn’t admit to is all the increases took place on private land where he had no control .
6547 2018-11-28 15:57:52 The State of Texas, the source of most of that oil production growth, had their AG suing your administration CONSTANTLY to try to keep you from screwing things up down here. Only after we were rid of you, did the production take off to reach record levels. You didn't drill that.

6549 2018-11-28 15:57:47 Seems as though Kushner is another snake oil salesman if he could convince Mexican Prez Nieto that the US has done even one single thing that was in the benefit of Mexico.

6551 2018-11-28 15:57:27 Agreed.  I paint, and I digitally draw.  There is a MAJOR difference.  I couldnt do half the things with oil on canvas that I can digitally
6552 2018-11-28 15:57:22 I can not wait till Saturday, HMU if you’ll be tailgating at Lucas Oil stadium for the bucks game 
6553 2018-11-28 15:57:16 Like dissolves like. And our next thread will be on why it's important to use oil for deep cleansing of your face.
6554 2018-11-28 15:57:11 3. Petra was in a valley unlike Mecca in the desert and it had parellel valley.

4. Petra had a stream with fields, trees, grass, clay, Loam.

5. Petra had olive trees for all their oil needs.  And it was situated near the pillar of salt.
6555 2018-11-28 15:57:01 It means that we have to buy russian gas and oil from Germany?
6556 2018-11-28 15:56:59 The economy was nosediving the statistics provided has shown that.
All you trying to do is shy away from it.
Yes we could possibly maintain it at a certain level but the sudden fall in crude oil prices dealt the economy a huge blow.
6557 2018-11-28 15:56:51 Michelle I guess we can give Obama credit. Obama tried to reduce oil production in many ways but private oil producers showed him what American exceptionalism is.
6558 2018-11-28 15:56:48 Olive oil? Cake?
6559 2018-11-28 15:56:36 In Labour's version of Hanukkah ,  JVL beat the Jews and turn the Temple into a shrine for the absolute boy.

The oil didn't last for 8 days, but they blamed that on a Jewish conspiracy.

6562 2018-11-28 15:56:22 Let's be serious, the Liberal tanker ban is limited to only restricting the shipment of Alberta oil.  Nothing about saving whales....environment.  

Alaskan oil and any other goods can be shipped right by.....

Canada is broken.  Sad.

6564 2018-11-28 15:56:19 Explorers and Producers Association of #Canada members currently estimate more than 150kbpd of oil production in Alberta has been shut-in given the "uneconomic price environment."

6569 2018-11-28 15:55:55 Thank you my ass! The state of Texas was limited to drilling.companies lost money or went out of business. The gulf coast was hurting in production of oil. 
You don't deserve 
6570 2018-11-28 15:55:50 Amazing! He can regulate fossil fuel through the Paris Accord AND make America the top oil producer in the world!...I didn’t even know you could do both at the same time! 
6571 2018-11-28 15:55:46 just casually waiting for my oil change and this guy hits and spills MY COFFEE all over ME. thank you very much sir.

6575 2018-11-28 15:55:25 BC continued obstruction of, and opposition to, AB/SK Energy industry should be responded to in kind.  Start vehicle inspections, boycott BC products, restrict oil sales, make it difficult like they are doing. BC is hurting our families here, it is time for economic response.

6579 2018-11-28 15:55:08 We must not turn a blind eye on Saudi Arabia. We are friends with them because of their oil & location in the Middle East. We must end our support of their horrific & genocidal war against Yemen. US bombs are being used to kill innocent Yemenis & thousands are starving to death.

6582 2018-11-28 15:54:46 What about the price of oil?  THATS what is making a diff to Ab revenues. Thank the Saudis for that!  They are the ones flooding the market with cheap light crude. Dilbit is only about $15/bbl. you cant ship it thru a non existent pipe for that

6586 2018-11-28 15:54:36 Attn Risk Managers of #OOTT #natgas : A certain oil trading and marketing firm (name started with a "P") in Houston in 1984 lost a year's income on one large December crude oil bet that wiped out trading profits (an bonuses) for that year. Is your bonus paid in the new year?
6587 2018-11-28 15:54:32 Sure no one is saying shit it down overnight and our consumption of Canadian oil can continue. What I am saying is no expansion and a managed wind down over decades.

Every ones hair responds to oil differently. Some oils just sit on the Hair.

6610 2018-11-28 15:53:12 Albertans can't think independently anymore, can't think straight, and the oil industry has them eating out of the palm of their hands. Anything outside their orthodoxy is considered heretical, absurd, and worthy of name calling,

Nobody ever seems to talk about just who is getting rich off wanting to stop climate change. Who's paying them? What's the point? Are we meant to believe oil companies are some sort of victims?

6648 2018-11-28 15:48:48 Oil is in for a long term slide. Sub 30$ should be price regime for years, say beyond 2024. Yet in short run deep slide may cause some bounce ups.

6651 2018-11-28 15:48:42 Going with the premise that the “oil belongs to citizens” then isn’t it only logical that we would cut production in a targeted way that maximizes our return? The less royalties paid get cut first? (Or completely shuttered).
6652 2018-11-28 15:48:40 Fact is: we millennials aren't buying cars or the gas to fill them. The job losses in the oil industry aren't Trudeau's fault, but a measure of the bottom line.

6657 2018-11-28 15:48:12 i'm somewhat of a weirdo. i actually think $0 would do it. i just go along with $xxx to make others happy. how does $0 fix anything? oil companies are so dependent on government for their existence, that if you keep them out of government, then they collapse.
6658 2018-11-28 15:48:12 Are our oil prices dropping because you defend the Saudi Prince? Seems these two subjects go hand and hand.

6661 2018-11-28 15:47:53 But there's the crux, right? Let's look at what Obama did: created more federal land free of oil production. Banned oil exploration off the coast. Expanded fracking. The bans are still in effect and fracking is occurring. Trump policies have produced no new or expanded production
6662 2018-11-28 15:47:49 @BarackObama takes credit for dapl and cheaper oil and gas. Dems silent. @realDonaldTrump actually lowers oil and gas prices and DEMOCRATS create higher local gas taxes to combat Truth. Trump has helped Americans obama hated Americans

6681 2018-11-28 15:46:14 .@JudiGreenwald: Transportation emissions are the most difficult to address, because low oil prices are a challenge and most historical progress in the U.S. has been through vehicle efficiency standards. #ITIFenergy
6682 2018-11-28 15:46:13 I disagree. Electric cars reduce our oil imports and trade imbalances, and consequently the number of wars our finest young people get killed in.

If 1/4 of the cars in the US were electric, we could kiss the ME goodbye. Wall the place off and let them kill each other.
6683 2018-11-28 15:46:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, or however many there may be.

6685 2018-11-28 15:46:07 The Saudis have nothing but oil and religious extremism to offer us. They need US way more than we need them. Your continued support of this terrorist family means that you and the POTUS have blood on your hands.
6686 2018-11-28 15:46:06 Lol 
6687 2018-11-28 15:46:02 HE SAID ITS FULL OF OIL NOW THAT IS FRYING
6688 2018-11-28 15:46:00 Oh now they see he is a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN. #DONTHECON
6689 2018-11-28 15:46:00 This poor sole is turning into a joke!  Obama making a fool of himself when he tries to take credit for achievements he tried to suppress!  He was so bought into “global warming” and hated oil, he tried to boost solar and destroy oil!
6690 2018-11-28 15:45:58 #CL oil inventories rose 3.58M barrels last week
6691 2018-11-28 15:45:57 Just got my oil changed and found out I need a new radiator.. Ugh

6693 2018-11-28 15:45:47 Whip together 2 cups cheddar with 4 1/2 tbsps kingfish. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve to your worst enemy.
6694 2018-11-28 15:45:37 Closer iyang view sa specimen and walay oil needed.
6695 2018-11-28 15:45:29 So, here’s the thing.....I have NEVER said I am against pipelines! I am against climate change and leaving a miserable planet for our children.  I believe we need oil, but we have a responsibility to do the best we can for the climate.  We need both!
6696 2018-11-28 15:45:26 Palm oil jollof with plenty aporoko is what they call designer rice in this Abuja  they now serve it inside abo ebo 
6697 2018-11-28 15:45:25 Remember when BP spilled 205 million gallons of oil in the ocean AND stayed in business? oops
6698 2018-11-28 15:45:11 Because ang 10x is only for scanning your slide and getting the general overview of it. Blurry na pud ang 100x kay oil immersion na na siya nga objective. You're supposed to use a special oil for that. The objective you can use is 40x gyud kay
6699 2018-11-28 15:45:09 #RT @NkirukaNistoran: RT @fesiyke: @NkirukaNistoran Why can't oil collapse since buhari made himself minister of petroleum
6700 2018-11-28 15:45:06 Our elected officials could even force the oil companies to pay for their construction? (Gotta dream)
6701 2018-11-28 15:45:05 This man is living in an alternate universe.  He did nothing for oil production in 8 years.
6702 2018-11-28 15:45:04 I recommend coconut oil!
6703 2018-11-28 15:44:59 Afghan president announces team to hold peace talks with Taliban: WHICH "PIECE" OF DA TALIBAN TALKS DO THEY WANNA HOLD? This "president" is a republicunt financial & "OIL" corp "koch"-sukka puppet, nothin' more, nothin' less !!
6704 2018-11-28 15:44:44 We were propelled to largest oil producer when Obama put Federal Land off limit to oil drilling, when Confronted by Romney during debate , ha lied about it and the Media Cheered.
6705 2018-11-28 15:44:42 Haha... spends billions of tax dollars subsidizing failed green energy industries, oil production goes up despite his best efforts to kill the industry, ends up calling it a success. The man is an artist.
6706 2018-11-28 15:44:34 Thank God you noticed, a lot of your brothers on Arewa twitter hv joined that tozalli'arafii ship
6707 2018-11-28 15:44:33 Useful pockets for Gamma and Neck Oil :)
6708 2018-11-28 15:44:22 There are hundreds of foods in the grocery store with palm oil in them, and every time you eat them, you help destroy the rain forest.
6709 2018-11-28 15:44:21 well, i have pretty high expectations! hope the tweets include any of the following: chili oil, toothbrushes, kitchen implements, various pumps, dragon dildos, conductive rope and/or paint and spitting in mouths.  funny bc i’m serious!
6710 2018-11-28 15:44:20 The man is clearly delusional. He gets credit only for all the oil produced in the USA's 57th state.
6711 2018-11-28 15:44:11 Wouldnt know.
Look for full spectrum tho, should guarantee a good entourage effect.
Thing is you could make your own with just TWO ingredients: vegetable oil, plant extract
If you can source organically grown all the merrier
6712 2018-11-28 15:44:08 I don’t know when referring to #African countries journalists say oil rich country, diamond rich but don’t do the same with European countries like France, cheese rich country, Italy pasta rich country?
6713 2018-11-28 15:43:59 Wheeler is a shill for corporate coal & oil. Fox, meet henhouse.
6714 2018-11-28 15:43:58 Shut up.... Palm oil kwa
6715 2018-11-28 15:43:52 Why are we buying oil from Saudi Arabia if we can buy if from Canada and Mexico?
6716 2018-11-28 15:43:45 ちかくにボルダリングジムがあるのですよね
6717 2018-11-28 15:43:41 You are as much to blame for the problem as any policy maker or CEO of an oil company
6718 2018-11-28 15:43:41 I used straight thc oil.
6719 2018-11-28 15:43:40 My boyfriend’s mom is such an angel. She prepared clothes and toiletries for me, she cooked a whole feast, SHE RUBBED COCONUT OIL ON MY BACK (I mean, who does that??? )

What immeasureable kindness. Must protect her at all costs 
6720 2018-11-28 15:43:31 So he is admitting he failed then, I wish he would be consistent.
6721 2018-11-28 15:43:27 @BarackObama had nothing to do w/oil production. He tried to kill the coal industry & he denied the oil industry access to offshore oil. His regs were meant to reduce energy consumption & handicap economic growth. Obama is like the rooster who takes credit for the dawn.
6722 2018-11-28 15:43:26 Well duh it’s full of oil

6725 2018-11-28 15:43:21 Obama wasn’t giving out approval for oil drilling. The drilling permits under Obama were granted under the Bush and Clinton administration.
6726 2018-11-28 15:43:09 Nixon’s Energy Department was created in 1977 because we imported more than half of crude oil we needed to survive AND natural gas was scheduled to hit ZERO by 1990.

America is still diluting gas with alcohol like we did when we were short on crude. No alcohol-prices will drop.
6727 2018-11-28 15:43:09 Agreed.  Distillate has been the clean-up hitter for oil. Export demand still very solid, but domestic consumption just struck out.
6728 2018-11-28 15:42:59 Follow up question, “what exactly did you do to make America the largest oil producer, specific please detail your strategy?”
6729 2018-11-28 15:42:55 I'm almost positive it might've been too cold. It sat yesterday. We didnt go anywhere. The battery has been replaced already. Oil changed. All fluids topped off. And filters replaced.
6730 2018-11-28 15:42:49 Oil first, corn second.
6731 2018-11-28 15:42:47 Probably. But ours is a culture committing suicide. In sovereign state system that we still, thankfully, cling to, our alliances will never be pure. Saudi Arabia is uniquely torn country, with oil. It's not torn between modernity and tradition, but between U.S. and Russia-China.
6732 2018-11-28 15:42:40 Tariff on cars made in Mexico why not a Tarriff on oil from anywhere but CANADA that is delivered to Canada fuck off #dias
6733 2018-11-28 15:42:36 Aw, holy cow, F*CK that guy. I knew he'd never go away...
6734 2018-11-28 15:42:35 it's a form of gambling that has NOTHING to do with how a business is actually doing, it's a playground for the richest folks and it causes unfair and entirely false costs and prices to the consumer.  like oil and gasoline too
6735 2018-11-28 15:42:32 There is a MASSIVE amount of CL Buystops in the order book at 51.55....  $CL #CL #CL_F $CL_F #CRUDE #OPEC #OIL $ES $ES_F #ES #ES_F #NQ #NQ_F #INDU $NQ #SPX $NDX $NQ $NQ_F #OOTT #FUTURES #DAYTRADING
6736 2018-11-28 15:42:28 Oil build was not good, but price is pretty beaten down and OPEC looms Dec 7th.  $60 WTIC and everybody probably happy.  Start losing jobs in certain areas below $45.
6737 2018-11-28 15:42:27 Wonder which policy @BarackObama enacted which encouraged oil production. Was it his support of any pipeline? Was it his support of ANWR drilling? Was it his support of off shore drilling?
6738 2018-11-28 15:42:26 all of that and oil is still dead
6739 2018-11-28 15:42:21 If crude oil continues to fall, hard hold gains for stock market / Dow Jones.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
6741 2018-11-28 15:42:13 Grade “A” scoring chances were 10-6 Oilers. Disproves your theory, Rob. 
6742 2018-11-28 15:41:51 Nope. He wanted to kill coal and oil consumption.
6743 2018-11-28 15:41:48 May God in his infinite mercy show you and your family mercy as you have helped this women. Sir you're such an amazing creature 

P.S I sell original coconut oil oooo Dm for patronage. And sir your can also help me sell too 

Pls follow me, I follow back fast
6744 2018-11-28 15:41:47 I’m a fan of the baby oil
6745 2018-11-28 15:41:39 Nope, they're all about the same. The difference is GM has to kowtow to the UAW. The stranglehold the unions have had on the big 3 has made American cars uncompetitive since the oil embargo in the 70s.

6747 2018-11-28 15:41:30 it's amazing to see how much the Iran oil waiver issue was misjudged by producers. though the US decision was ultimately sensible, OPEC will see it as another instance of the US being an unreliable actor.
6748 2018-11-28 15:41:28 CHOPPED: With guest chef Drake. Fast manure, idiotic farts, crispy palm oil, deodorant. Dessert, 30 minutes. GO.
6749 2018-11-28 15:41:28 Coconut oil after showering! But just a little otherwise my bangs looks horrifyingly greasy.
6750 2018-11-28 15:41:21 You ever saw that tweet where they use motor oil for syrup? This has gotta be on the same level.
6751 2018-11-28 15:41:13 I can’t open my god dam cbd oil because it’s child proof
6752 2018-11-28 15:41:09 I used a pinch of motor oil so i only gotta do it once
6753 2018-11-28 15:41:08 because in commercials they use motor oil on pancakes because it doesn’t sink in, but looks like syrup
6754 2018-11-28 15:41:00 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
6755 2018-11-28 15:41:00 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6756 2018-11-28 15:40:44 A little olive oil, a little za’atar and some fresh, soft pita goes a long way!
6757 2018-11-28 15:40:34 Thats true but typically things get valued on sentiment. If management can hit oil, some of the scepticism by investors will have changed that the company can actually deliver. On that basis, they would rerate
6758 2018-11-28 15:40:22 Um, are you watching oil prices? Our production & keeping the Saudis pumping hurts Russia. One of our domestic natural gas companies inked a deal to supply Poland with natural gas. Driving down prices and picking off Russian customers hurts Russia and helps us.
6759 2018-11-28 15:40:18 Why hasn't the syrup melted into the pancakes? Oh because it's MOTOR OIL
6760 2018-11-28 15:40:17 I’m losing my shit ! The samples I just discovered....new mixtape alert , might just fuck around and call it “Baby Oil Music”
6761 2018-11-28 15:40:11 I hear ya, but someone like Corbin will command a 5 year deal. I'd like to think Capt Coconut Oil wont be here in 5 years

6766 2018-11-28 15:39:45 long overdue. It is a shame that PNM's drive for extreme profits has kept us stuck. TO say nothing of NM selling out to Oil. 
PNM was just whining last year about how they are not making enough money...because of LED's and more efficiency.
6767 2018-11-28 15:39:42 Oil still getting smoked. Bitcoin had a bounce last night
6768 2018-11-28 15:39:42 Would it shock you to learn that Trump Inc is heavily invested in Canadian oil?
6769 2018-11-28 15:39:37 Jack Monroe had a shit fit that someone put oil on pancakes when people had to use foodbanks.

6771 2018-11-28 15:39:28 Internet fked up the TV deal. Damn America and their freedom. They made automobile, airplane, computers, ac electricity, internet, telephones, rockets, railroads, drill OIL and refine gasoline. WHY? Because those innovations only come from minds that dwell in freedom/liberty
6772 2018-11-28 15:39:28 1,000g bread flour

600g warm water 

100g veg oil

25g sugar

25g salt

1TBS active dry yeast.

Mix the wet plus yeast, add to dry.  Let rise an hour, divide into 2 loaves, rest 20 - 40 mins, bake at 375 for 40 mins or until 200F in center.

Not super fast, but mostly down-time
6773 2018-11-28 15:39:20 Pretty bullish price action in #oil .. 2nd day in a row we get hugher inventories and the market buys the dip in $CL_F
6774 2018-11-28 15:39:17 #EIA #data: US. total #oil products supplied last 4-week period averaged 21.1 million bpd, +5.6% vs year ago; #gasoline avg 9.2 mln bpd, -0.9%; #distillate avg 4.2 mln bpd, +2.0%; #jet #fuel +4.1% vs yr ago. #OOTT #energy #OPEC #diesel #inventory #oilprice #oilprices #shipping
6775 2018-11-28 15:39:13 $ZL_F Bean oil up nearly 2%.
6776 2018-11-28 15:39:00 He slapped tariffs on all the products the US imports daily, except on the 4 millions barrels of sweet light crude oil we sell to your nation as per NAFTA rules in Canadian dollars at the same price we sell to our own refineries. Ever wonder why it's tariff free?
6777 2018-11-28 15:38:59 I got you but idk measurements, I eyeball it lol. Cornmeal, flour, baking powder, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, one egg, butter/oil, milk and a medium roasted sweet potato!
6778 2018-11-28 15:38:59 For perspective if you took an oil drum and filled it with cauliflower it would be worth well over $100. I know its not exactly a valid comparison but still. Oil isnt the end all be all
6779 2018-11-28 15:38:51 All I see is motor oil now 
6780 2018-11-28 15:38:50 Seborin Hair Tonic

I love these products
6781 2018-11-28 15:38:47 Debería subir oil ?
6782 2018-11-28 15:38:47 Don't blame Toyota. In cheap oil days GM built big fat cheap made cars that looked well made to laymen because of size/weight. GM could take idle plants and license build cars like Peugeot , Citroen , Mitsubishi, and others. GMs are brand damaged.
6783 2018-11-28 15:38:46 Try peppermint essential oil on the back of your neck! Does me WONDERS with severe nausea! Hope you feel better soon
6784 2018-11-28 15:38:44 Are these for pure CO2 storage or CCS used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR)?
If CCS contributes to lowering the cost of fossil fuels through EOR it's merits could be questioned.
6785 2018-11-28 15:38:40 Humans wipe out animals because of greed and fun. Hunting for sport is BS. Wiping out protected areas to put oil lines in. Logging the rainforest. The earth lived in harmony for millions of years, man will destroy it all within the next couple hundred.
6786 2018-11-28 15:38:35 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts pumpkin seed oil with 1 part orange juice and 1 part miso. Add pepper and jam to taste.
6787 2018-11-28 15:38:32 We need to open up all the oil resources the US has then so we stop suckling off them. That way they can't threaten to hold oil and have the market freak out and gas prices skyrocket. Then, it's easy to tell them fook off don't ya think?

6792 2018-11-28 15:38:15 They forgot to charge me for my oil change yesterday 
6793 2018-11-28 15:38:11 Cause I just heard a report on NPR that because the dip in oil prices a couple years back, that caused US drillers to consolidate and get leaner which caused them to be able to pump for even less $. And they are currently drilling but not tapping wells just waiting for demand
6794 2018-11-28 15:38:04 The $80 million dollar a day loss is simply false, based on a bad calculation in one Scotiabank report. It is a manipulative rallying cry by oil industry to force politicians to bend to their will & distract from real urgency for constraints from @IPCC_CH report. Thread #cdnpoli
6795 2018-11-28 15:38:04 Well, the Obama administration used tear gas on Indigenous Peoples at Standing Rock, so this comes as no surprise. They also used water cannons in the dead of Winter. The Obama administration's actions at Standing Rock, in defense of oil interests, was horrific.
6796 2018-11-28 15:38:03 Who wants to do me a huge favor and take my car to get an oil change 
6797 2018-11-28 15:37:41 Higher interest as to compensate for higher inflation. Spending it now may make sense putting it in bank if IR not attractive enough. Owning it as investment probably depends what's one's outlook on Oil. 1 year Lira investment seems feasible.
6798 2018-11-28 15:37:41 $DWT resistance at these levels, if we see a bounce in oil would expect it here.
6799 2018-11-28 15:37:41 You're half right. I am all for abandoning it and all of the now utterly useless  in the age of shale oil Middle East. No point to this headache any longer.
6800 2018-11-28 15:37:37 That’s motor oil! 

780       112k
6801 2018-11-28 15:37:19 I just got the oil for my anxiety. It tastes like shit and was expensive but it does help me a lot.
6802 2018-11-28 15:37:18 Oil inventories top estimates
6803 2018-11-28 15:37:16 Two Greek shipping companies pled guilty in Texas federal court to dumping oil from the ballast tanks of a ship while docked in Houston & Port Arthur and agreed to pay a $4 million fine.
6804 2018-11-28 15:37:16 Pan on fire => add olive oil => add garlic => add shrooms => stir a while => remove from fire => add parsley => stir => little bit of lemon => GO ;-)
6805 2018-11-28 15:37:12 Heating oil as well apparently..
6806 2018-11-28 15:37:10 This is the most impactful part of Amy's statement IMO. How the monopoly that existed in the past administrations stifled other industry players in the oil/port services sector and how PMB broke the monopoly. An indigenous company is now thriving. Atiku's plan is to take us back.
6807 2018-11-28 15:37:09 Minerals you idiot, which includes oil, as I've told you if you oil production began in 2012.
6808 2018-11-28 15:37:08 Just like the way high pressure natural gas won’t make you assess oil and water in an underground reservoir .
6809 2018-11-28 15:37:05 Just that thirty minutes on an empty stomach is the equivalent of TWO HRS with a full belly of food. The fat will MELT AWAY And eat fish oil gel caps with you're food as well as canned  tuna in water.

6811 2018-11-28 15:37:02 What is cold pressed oil?
6812 2018-11-28 15:37:01 *CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES ROSE 3.58 MLN BARRELS, EIA SAYS #OOTT
6813 2018-11-28 15:36:54 Now that I’ve watched that viral video on how companies make their ads I have to ask, is that motor oil in a syrup container?
6814 2018-11-28 15:36:50 Reminder shale oil is a debt ridden and environmental time bomb

And the equity is crashing.
6815 2018-11-28 15:36:45 We need to decouple our economy from oil because if we keep burning it we are all dead from climate change.
6816 2018-11-28 15:36:43 I like to imagine they sent this, the delivery truck immediately crashed into an oil tanker and exploded into a ball go flame before flying off the edge of a cliff, then they sent the revised delivery time.
6817 2018-11-28 15:36:39 I was so excited to try Starbucks’ juniper latte this morning. 

Oh my...I imagine it’s a bit like drinking sweetened diffuser oil. 
6818 2018-11-28 15:36:34 So turns out soap making is like making mayonnaise. You pour caustic soda into oil to emulsify - except caustic soda can burn through clothes & your skin, cause blindness & lets out toxic fumes. An easy craft to want to pick up then...

6821 2018-11-28 15:36:17 Mayonnaise is basically oil and eggs in a suspension with a little vinegar or lemon juice for acid. It’s less about the final product than the sum of the parts in relation to the rest of the recipe.

6825 2018-11-28 15:36:05 - but hemp derived stuff is legal because hemp is. Hemp and weed are not the same species, they just share the same biological family. CBD can be derived from both, you just need to research the brand of oil and make sure they’re transparent about their product. (2/2)

6844 2018-11-28 15:34:27 Look, comparing the new OP's price to MP-10 is a bit unfair. Oil markups happened, and it looks to be a more complex toy. Being notably more expensive is understandable. But 440 BUCKS is just absolutely absurd.

6846 2018-11-28 15:34:18 From what I’ve learned through research, it’s a situation based on the source of the CBD oil itself; whether it’s derived from hemp or marijuana is where the difference is. Derived from marijuana can be defined as a “refined” product and is highly illegal- (1/2)

6854 2018-11-28 15:33:40 @FairQuestions We need Dias working 4 the oil & gas sector in Canada? The sector itself, & all the big players, need to invest heavily into their own multi-year PR/gov't lobbying campaigns in order to change perceptions, pressure gov't & battle against U.S. opposition dollars.
6855 2018-11-28 15:33:40 This: "Bake a much larger cake". I don't understand why they are not interested. The oil sector generates all the goodies for us but we've been doing slightly over 2 million barrels for over three decades. Why?

6870 2018-11-28 15:32:46 Big banks have a lot of debt exposure already, especially in the energy space. Plunging oil has created more risk and many are starting to deleverage instead of adding debt. Corporations are tightening IMO and paying down debt rather than doing buybacks.

6953 2018-11-28 15:27:08 The main article fails to mention a point included in a Comment; the oil industry constantly mislabels Diluted Bitumen as "heavy crude", masking many of the perils of DilBit. Including the need for an additional (expensive) Processing to remove solids before it can be refined.

6961 2018-11-28 15:26:03 "ok so lets keep getting oil changes/picking up the dog shit/taking out the trash because its obviously working. Every year. after year."

See how stupid that sounds?

6964 2018-11-28 15:25:52 Great solid tuck that has been well maintained. 

Brand new brakes, belts, and newer tires. 

Just got the oil changed. 

A little surface rust on the back wheel wells.
6965 2018-11-28 15:25:52 People fall in love or choose a life partner based on many things. Looks is just one of them. Perhaps she fell in love with his mind, his heart, his...nah. Can't do it. He's a whole bag of hideous puss wrapped up in the skin of a snake oil salesman/ Vegas grifter.
6966 2018-11-28 15:25:47 @Osolu_Dzee anointing oil?
6967 2018-11-28 15:25:47 So global alarmists r crying the world is warming. But screaming electric cars! Electricity takes coal and oil . Do t get it
6968 2018-11-28 15:25:37 What brand of coconut oil do y’all use for y’all hair and where do you get it from ?
6969 2018-11-28 15:25:36 nah folks just now finding out that food commericials are a scam. one of the biggest ones is replacing motor oil for syrup because it doesn't absorb into the breakfast item lol
6970 2018-11-28 15:25:32 Here is the true reason: a good portion of total oil companies cost is denominated in Ruble. If it goes up, cost goes up, profit goes down.   Higher p=oil prices will push the ruble up, and consequently the cost.
6971 2018-11-28 15:25:19 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Palm Oil improves the shelf life of our sandwiches. Thanks. - Melissa
6972 2018-11-28 15:25:14 I was just talking to Paris. I need to get my oil!

6979 2018-11-28 15:24:26 I mean dry pan tapos oil. Minsan kasi may tubig tubig pa yung pan pag nilagyan ng oil kaya tumatalsik. And dry din yung iffry.

Thanks
6982 2018-11-28 15:24:14 I saw a vegan activist I know going on about how palm oil is absolutely fine and I was kinda shocked.
6983 2018-11-28 15:24:14 I use CBD oil to treat nasal inflammation.  It works in two ways, reduces inflammation, and hydrates nasal passages.
6984 2018-11-28 15:24:13 Playing the what if game , what if the electricity goes out and we can't pump gas into our cars or oil into our homes like the Halloween snow in the NE ? It's simple chemistry .
6985 2018-11-28 15:24:05 Fine. I guess I’ll get my oil changed 
6986 2018-11-28 15:24:01 He lied that prices will be brought under control while fragging the opposition for 'being insensitive to the people's woes'. When he came, crude oil prices dropped and he promptly increased the excise duty several times. Another term, I hope not - don't want to leave my country!
6987 2018-11-28 15:23:50 Jeg tror, det er en vegansk bog krydret med snake oil og tvivlsomme råd.
6988 2018-11-28 15:23:42 Anybody know a doctor I could go to about a fractured hand, stress, change the oil in my car, ADD, and a sinus infection all in one sitting?
6989 2018-11-28 15:23:42 Would you do your job at the wages you were paid decades ago. People work to produce your oil and turn it into gasoline/diesel, drilling is a dangerous job, refining, making different fuel mixtures for your local area, shipping to your local area.
6990 2018-11-28 15:23:36 Somebody please replace the oil that Ivanka uses for her vocal fry. Her voice just keeps getting greasier and loosing its crispness 
6991 2018-11-28 15:23:33 Virgin olive oil from?
6992 2018-11-28 15:23:30 He is correct, oil production did increase, however, it was all under state permits, because he refused to approve any federal permits to drill. He had nothing to do with the increase, in fact there was more oil production despite him. Takes no blame but all the credit.
6993 2018-11-28 15:23:30 But with an oil change every 2-3,000 miles the car still runs like its brand new
6994 2018-11-28 15:23:28 Agree. I didn't call a top at 75 when many were calling for $100 oil. I just took my swing sell signal at 75.42 and will take my swing buy signal when it flashes which may be soon based on the positive divergence building and Monday's candlestick.

7015 2018-11-28 15:21:51 They've been brought up in the oil world thinking theor shit don't stink. We'll it does Alberta and more than most.

7017 2018-11-28 15:21:45 How can a Norway deal possibly be better for Britain than the current membership?! Fair enough, it might be better for the 5m population of Norway (control over oil, fishing) but it’s certainly not better for Britain. I thoughts all relevant studies on that were done ages ago?
7018 2018-11-28 15:21:37 The life of depending on a man seems so unfulfilling. But after finals szn I may mess around and find me an old white oil tycoon.

7025 2018-11-28 15:21:21 It actually looks more like OPEC may not cut at all as Saudi stated they won’t go it alone. Putin also said he is fine with $60 oil = Russia won’t cut. So Canadian Energy is doomed.
7026 2018-11-28 15:21:20 Have you tried cbd oil? It is helping me so much with pain,stress and sleeping

7033 2018-11-28 15:21:05 It's not the end of the world. 
We do have oil central heating.
The log burner has now been demoted to purely ornamental.
7034 2018-11-28 15:21:04 I'm so glad to see others expressing their disappointment with this. @goop
is not ok. They are centered around the premise that we are not enough as we are and make their money by pushing ideas that are at best snake oil and at worst harmful.
7035 2018-11-28 15:21:04 "Oil magnet " Nice!
7036 2018-11-28 15:21:03 Huh?!? The guy who stood in the way of Keystone and Alaskan oil development?
7037 2018-11-28 15:21:00 Beautiful piece. What about envisioning a world where farmers are producing only sustainable palm oil, companies are sourcing only sustainable palm oil and projects for forest conservation restored forests and its wildlife? It requires collaboration and joined forces..

7046 2018-11-28 15:20:26 Cutting production, turning off the taps! May benefit prices but create the straw on the camels back for those seated, head in hands at their table with final notice bills covering it! Trudeau said he was shutting down Western Oil and he did! Still no pipes East, West just South?
7047 2018-11-28 15:20:24 Killing us who built a career on drilling for oil.
7048 2018-11-28 15:20:24 But he used their infrastructure, and everything else they built with, in part, oil and hedge fund money...

And let's be honest, he lost by more than 4 million votes; you can say the voters made a mistake if you want, but he certainly wasn't cheated out of a win...
7049 2018-11-28 15:20:20 Alright we get it y’all know about the cardboard and motor oil thing now shut the fuck up

7053 2018-11-28 15:20:14 Of course. Duh. We're going to be screwed before we fix anything.

7057 2018-11-28 15:20:08 Actually W had a lot to do with it, he was the one who first increased our production after 9-11.  The oil industry was a quagmire under obama of regulations and opposition like he did to coal. Trump had it easy on this one, he just had to de-obama the industry and it took off.
7058 2018-11-28 15:20:07 @JudgeJeanine Are aLL democrats delusional? Obama: "Suddenly America is the largest oil producer, that was me people ... say thank you."
7059 2018-11-28 15:20:00 Oil continues to bounce back after finding good support at the psychological level of $50 a barrel.
7060 2018-11-28 15:19:58 Between him and Bill Clinton they've done more damage to our energy economy then any other president in history what he's talking about now is b******* he done nothing but listen to the environmentalist and shut the oil down no drilling no exploration no pipeline Trump did it..

7078 2018-11-28 15:18:59 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
7079 2018-11-28 15:18:56 The oil barons used price at the pump fear mongering and labeled it as a "tax on consumers." 

I'm pushing for the state legislature to pass it given the larger Dem majority in both chambers and the governor's mansion.
7080 2018-11-28 15:18:43 I’m aware of that. Tough to take numbers and information from that source. I’ve tried finding a source that is centred politically and I can not find it.

And, I don’t think we should provide subsidies to oil and gas at all. I’d like them to make money and pay tax.
7081 2018-11-28 15:18:42 Why should we thank the guy who said we couldn't drill our way to energy independence and opposed oil drilling at every turn?

7095 2018-11-28 15:17:52 She doesn't challenge (as politicians and oil/coal companies try to do) the overwhelming evidence that global warming is anthropogenic, that it is caused by CO2, that it can be slowed or reversed, or that it threatens coastal areas. She quibbles with some sea level predictions.

7097 2018-11-28 15:17:48 OK .... WAIT!! SOMEBODY HELP ... I KEEP SEEING PEOPLE CALL SYRUP , MOTOR OIL .. WHAT GIVES ?
7098 2018-11-28 15:17:45 Curious as to why you keep including heating and stove oil when those prices aren't regulated as gasoline and diesel are.

7100 2018-11-28 15:17:36 It all depends on what you getting.   This is oil on a 24x30 in  canvas something like this would easily be around 200.
7101 2018-11-28 15:17:30 How you do your hair oil treatment tho? Just warm up whatever oil and massage it on your scalp?

7106 2018-11-28 15:17:20 Analysts are calling bargain prices after oil's recent selloff. But few are stepping in to buy just yet. 
 
Bullish speculators have been hammered by a dramatic fall in crude prices, driven by an unexpected influx of supply and signs of weakening economic growth.
7107 2018-11-28 15:17:10 I’d love to see these fools try anything from Cal 2 or University Physics 2 Electromagnetism and Light , it would be laughable.  Do they even know what a Taylor series polynomial is??? I think not.

7115 2018-11-28 15:16:49 It alters the bottom line of every business. Oil producing states and communities are also very affected by the price of gas and oil. The price of shipping on every product goes up.

7121 2018-11-28 15:16:23 Wow. Where to begin. 1. Total reversal of all GOP positioning. 2.  GM no more 'takes money' than any business out there. Oil, ethanol, coal, nuclear, farmers all have special programs; so all 'take money'. What you're basically describing is a command economy. 3. GM has /1

7125 2018-11-28 15:16:18 Its interesting how the small the volumes are on MLP's I am adding to today as they drop. $ENBL and $ENLC noticable drops for any volume despite outrageous distribution yields and coverage levels. Still some pressure on more liquid names like $ET too #oil #oott

7134 2018-11-28 15:15:39 @DrDanish5 sir my question for minister asad umer was he says that we extend tax rate on rich peoples but the rich peoples will extract this money informs of high in price of daily use items which is daily used by aam awam. i.e cocking oil per kg increase by 20 to 30 ruppes.
7135 2018-11-28 15:15:37 Sure, let's ignore the entire region, let them attack each other with nukes most likely and subject 80% of the known oil reserves to contamination for 10,000 years.  What a great plan. You need help.
7136 2018-11-28 15:15:36 Why does the govt subsidies an established company like GM anyway?  Same w oil.  Farming is a bit different.
7137 2018-11-28 15:15:24 We know why we're the largest oil producer and it's not because of Obama. Patting himself on the back is his latest hobby.
7138 2018-11-28 15:15:22 i use NARS moisturizer because it’s oil free and i don’t break out anymore!!

Come oil this ass up on my bed... then punish me 
7140 2018-11-28 15:15:16 Wouldnt hold your breath mate, they have said they will need alternative financing so i can only read that as a placing at some point. Hopefully after first oil shows from R1/R2 and in the double digits. Its been so poorly handled so far though, wouldnt put anything past them.

7150 2018-11-28 15:14:31 This the same government that yanked the shank out of the back of Alberta oil and stuck it in the back of Ontario auto workers?? The Trudeau Liberal Terrorist Crime Family?? That government?
7151 2018-11-28 15:14:29 Do the math. What is the value of every 1% increase in oil supply from SA?
7152 2018-11-28 15:14:10 What are these cock ups you speak of . A bit like the tin of primer I just opened that was oil based

7156 2018-11-28 15:13:58 Right. Trucks don't have anything to do with agricultural business, or oil production, or other industry at all.  Must be the tariffs.

Dummy.
7157 2018-11-28 15:13:57 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
7158 2018-11-28 15:13:51 That’s one reason why I’m prepared to buy relatively expensive kit to try to get off grid. At least the money isn’t going to the oil war and pollution industry then. But it’s all getting cheaper anyway. Only a matter of time now.

7166 2018-11-28 15:13:09 My breakfast was goat cheese on artisan whole wheat toast with olive oil mayo and an apple. I either eat oatmeal and cranberries/nuts and almond milk and honey or eggs toast and when I first arise I eat a homemade super healthy popsicle of mixed berries or green goddess juices
7167 2018-11-28 15:13:07 Texas ,Ohio etc.
Despite the amount of crude deposit in America,they've nt exported crude oil the last 40years ,but refined petroleum products after the National Security Adviser Office sent the proposal to the American Senate as a fall out of petrol stations drying up in America
7168 2018-11-28 15:13:01 we followed the advise of "laura ingals" from her books "little house on the prairie". after using modern medicines remedies that didn't work so well looked it up in laura's books and used the same lamp oil that they used.  it worked to kill 100% of all head lice.

7176 2018-11-28 15:12:36 But why do that? Saudi Arabia/their royal family use the weapons we sell them to kill children. They torture/murder their own people, suppress women, & they bred many of the people who planned/carried out 9/11. They are a DEstabalizing force in the Middle East. So, just oil? Why?
7177 2018-11-28 15:12:36 Good analysis. What’s your 19E benchmark WTI assumption
7178 2018-11-28 15:12:35 The last time I protested was against the Iraq (oil) war when over a million turned out and were totally ignored. The war was a disaster and who would have thought it. We can vote with how we spend our money though and that’s something. And with our choices.

7181 2018-11-28 15:11:57 so after working at starbucks, my opinions have changed: tim hortons kinda sucks dick lmao. like, starbucks coffee still tastes like oil to me but tim hortons tastes like really really bad oil

And what would Tony say about the book after reading it at their next lunch of squid ink?

7188 2018-11-28 15:11:34 Sweden, New Zealand and Malta among others do manage perfectly well without any oil. Having it as a commodity is a plus. Unless you all think Scottish people are uniquely stupid for self government. You could wait until the Tory immigration cap strangles the Scottish economy.

7196 2018-11-28 15:10:50 Across Canada in 2017, $146 billion worth of provincial GDP came from mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction.  New Brunswick generated 0.2% of that total.  Even a 10 fold increase in the GDP from this sector would be less than our ‘share’ of the national GDP. #nbpoli

7200 2018-11-28 15:10:37 I wish that were true.  The focus is on London.  It’s why no deal with Europe in the future will include Services.  We have Oil, green energy, even if we joined EFTA, we would have the same bargaining chip as Norway or Iceland
7201 2018-11-28 15:10:36 Benedict Arnold Trump is bending over for big oil, and the entire fossil fuel industry.
7202 2018-11-28 15:10:35 I think you should change the word "predicted" to "calculated". It's obvious that since international oil price has gone down significantly lately plus rand has strengthened then petrol will definitely go down
7203 2018-11-28 15:10:31 Which begs the question from my perspective how much impact Obamas decisions had on the flow of oil. THAT is my point. I'm saying you're right bad claim, but also, wrong to demonize guy who made little diff one way or another DESPITE all no-public-drilling hate.
7204 2018-11-28 15:10:24 Trump is going to meet with the Saudi crown prince as was scheduled so the official reaction by our govt to the murder is....oil is cheap you know?

7208 2018-11-28 15:10:14 The SWF is funded now by oil sales. It wasn't at inception. I remember very well how states pushed against transferring funds to it from the ECA, that's why the initial funding came from an Eurobond, not sure but I think even the World bank donated funding.

7212 2018-11-28 15:09:54 Another oil dependent sucka. Yeah Mchenry fire happened when before? Oil is your crack.
7213 2018-11-28 15:09:48 The oil increase took place on private lands over which Obama had no control. His record on oil production on public/federal lands was miserable. Reminds me of Clinton taking credit for economic gains due to Republican changes he loudly opposed.
7214 2018-11-28 15:09:38 In case it's not obvious, the point is: Putin doesn't worry for good reason - he's going to make a lot of money at virtually any oil price, as long as the RUB stays weak...It almost makes it rational for him to stoke the fire with Ukraine from this perspective
7215 2018-11-28 15:09:30 Looking for the mentioned crude oil counter-trends, and the gold “bigger picture”.

7222 2018-11-28 15:08:48 It’s snowing a little...which reminded me that I should order fuel oil so I don’t have to learn how to restart my new boiler. Thanks, Mother Nature for the gentle reminder!
7223 2018-11-28 15:08:43 In under a decade we saw the price point of oil which kills demand and the price point which kills supply. Commodities prices don't operate in a silo. They impact consumer habits. Seriously I want to see that diploma from Wharton.

7230 2018-11-28 15:08:28 A life of worship, devotion, and holiness is a disturbance to the complacent. "Why this waste?" they asked Mary of Bethany, as she poured the oil upon Jesus.

7234 2018-11-28 15:08:20 We need a relationship with Saudi Arabia due to their oil supply, and more importantly due them being the only major opposition to the much more dangerous Iran. I’d take a partnership with Saudi over Iran any day. I agree that they should be punished, but we can’t cut ties.
7235 2018-11-28 15:08:19 In under a decade we saw the price point of oil which kills demand and the price point which kills supply. Commodities prices don't operate in a silo. They impact consumer habits. Seriously I want to see that diploma from Wharton.
7236 2018-11-28 15:08:14 God bless you sir. But we need Lagos to become more traffic friendly. The pains we go through lately have been excruciating. Also, before @AlimoshoOnline becomes a landmine, something urgently needs to be done around the waste dumpsites.  That's Lagos' version of oil spillage!
7237 2018-11-28 15:08:13 Would love to be the guy who thinks if we tax carried interest or nationalize the country's oil resource we'll put a sucking chest wound in the world money supply and scuttle the next iPhone but is like cool, flood Balboa Island, it's fine, ppl will move, this is not a problem.

7240 2018-11-28 15:08:10 Its actually counterintuitive but heavily oil can be used in a higher variety of finished products than light oil. once a refinery is upgraded to handle it with the initial investment, its more desirable than light oil.Please stop spreading misinformation. You are clearly biased.
7241 2018-11-28 15:08:09 Aitor, tengo 59 años. Toda los días voy al trabajo en coche (cerca de la cervecería Duna) y la próxima vez que eche gas oíl me fijaré
7242 2018-11-28 15:08:04 It’s his jelly that’s golden  And I’m also waiting for his magical love oil to arrive. Very much looking forward to unwrapping that package.
7243 2018-11-28 15:08:00 Right now no one cares about that...For the next week or so it is all about pushing oil lower to put more pressure on OPEC...I already started selling call 54 for Dec, 7th maturity.
7244 2018-11-28 15:07:56 Shit I forgot I gotta get an oil change
7245 2018-11-28 15:07:55 i guess i could get up and go get my oil changed and shit
7246 2018-11-28 15:07:50 We are terraforming the planet by raising global temps. To reverse that is a monumental undertaking. Humans deploy cheap available energy - wood, coal, oil to get power. How do you change that? Capitalists don't help, but the challenge is historically unprecedented
7247 2018-11-28 15:07:50 See this gettin oil changes and car details and having to sit here? Not my thing lol , when i do get a boyfriend we switchin cars

7249 2018-11-28 15:07:48 In Houst Chron - Tintera didn’t think report would be a turning point for climate policy but that it would add to the growing research available to regulators.”There is no way you could  make oil and gas industry not function. The negative impact on society would be horrendous,”
7250 2018-11-28 15:07:48 PHEW thank you we’re getting there, just need a beard brush and oil
7251 2018-11-28 15:07:35 Sana oil.
7252 2018-11-28 15:07:33 Not sure why this is so difficult for people to accept. It is rather obvious the puck is not flat so they won't overturn that. Is it in? Probably but common sense doesn't come into this type of call. It never has and never will.
7253 2018-11-28 15:07:31 Yeah that sucks. My wife had a similar problem, took her car to Wal-Mart for an oil change, got in her car and there was oil and grease ALL OVER the interior.
7254 2018-11-28 15:07:23 Better subsidies for "them" than the oil and coal and nuclear industries.

7265 2018-11-28 15:06:19 Prospective Bidders must build a Refinery first five years of it's operation in Nigeria to process 50% of it's crude oil in Nigeria for export .
America in 1972 adopted that (it's policy is 100% of prospect  crude must be refined in America) and led to growth of Refinaries in
7266 2018-11-28 15:06:18 Reminder: Shannon Watts is the corporate public relations executive from Monsanto. Also did work for big oil after the BP gulf coast spill.

She’s a professional propagandist, and very well paid.

7272 2018-11-28 15:05:44 It’s like TPPF guys have never been in a West Texas dust storm. They say they’re against all subsidies but only lobby against subsidies for competition to their funders.

7276 2018-11-28 15:05:27 Hi @MarcAspinall Not currently, the black wax is a dry wax so it doesn't have that classic waxy oil feel to it. Can also make one up in any material you like :)

7281 2018-11-28 15:05:10 We eat out rarely, so not much of an issue. Eat lots of butter fat, animal fats, with peanut or sunflower oil for hot cooking, olive for cold foods. Seems the increase in animal fat was the trick to balance Omega 6, 3.

JW (chain) estimated $600 to replace a car exhaust pipe

Triangle Auto (local) replaced the pipe AND muffler, added wipers,  headlamp, & antifreeze, changed oil, rotated tires & did state inspection: $635 total

7286 2018-11-28 15:04:49 Had a whole lecture on this type of stuff in culinary school. More motor oil in food commercials than actual food sometimes
7287 2018-11-28 15:04:37 @JustinTrudeau WHY DID YOU LET BC GET AWAY WITH MURDERING THE OIL INDUSTRY?
7288 2018-11-28 15:04:25 Republicans have so much of their money invested in non renewable energy such as oil, coal and natural gas. Democrats Have the majority of their money invested in renewable energy such as solar, wind and water. What does that tell people?
7289 2018-11-28 15:04:21 With West TX gas prices plummeting the talk that well production profitability is still increasing is becoming confused with breakeven costs falling.  Yes cost to produce are falling but revenue from gas plummetting. Gas is a huge chunk of what makes oil production profitable.
7290 2018-11-28 15:04:20 That dab oil stuff closes my throat up and dries out my mouth idk how y’all be smoking it all the time

7300 2018-11-28 15:03:38 You forgot to mention the Palm Oil.

#NoPalmOilChristmas
7301 2018-11-28 15:03:34 @Justintrudeau picks favourites. Jerry Dias, Union thug, is his bestie. It's a symbiotic relationship. Trudeau granted $595 million tax $ to gov. hand picked 'trusted reliable' media & workers who r in Dias's union. Oil workers probably don't vote 4 this puppet.
7302 2018-11-28 15:03:34 It is noteworthy that owning an oil company will be less lucrative than owning a palm kernel farm in a few years from now.

7303 2018-11-28 15:03:33 Everyone is afraid of Powell. Hopefully his speaking is gonna be a little more dovish considering oil crash and GM downsizing

7305 2018-11-28 15:03:29 Olive OilとかEVISBEATSも好きそうですね…
7306 2018-11-28 15:03:23 Not really Leon, I worked over 2 decades in the Alberta oilfield in artificial lift of conventional oil. I wasn't aware to the extent that the major companies had much of their own upgrading & refining occurring. So it is relevant for the public to see that 20% is only impacted.
7307 2018-11-28 15:03:09 Trudeau, like his father does not like Alberta. Also he vowed to phase out the oil sands. Canadians voted to legalize pot and look whSt a mess that is lol. Let’s get high and lose jobs
7308 2018-11-28 15:03:06 The oil industry is the next to be cutting jobs. We can’t remain independent of foreign crude at these prices. Our industry isn’t subsidized by the federal government and these prices are killing off small independent oil companies!
7309 2018-11-28 15:02:53 Government upset about GM closing 1 plant, meanwhile losing millions a day and 20x the jobs bc we cant get our oil to the coast. Government doesn't give a shit about anyone west of Ontario. Rural canadians aren't on any government's radar anymore it seems.
7310 2018-11-28 15:02:35 Yes please ask!
7311 2018-11-28 15:02:25 I checked my oil in this damn 38 degrees weather this morning.., I honestly didn’t know what tf I was doing but heyy I made it to work

7314 2018-11-28 15:02:18 The dominance of the oil and gas sector in energy supply has held back our development of other energy resources and it is only now that we are exploring thwir potential in a manner that may actually produce results.

Omega 3's  inhibit  inflammation,    whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish  oils contain  more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or  radiation

This is stone nuts.

Pres. Corpseman expended every ounce in his scrawny mom-jeaned body to minimize US oil & gas production. 

In fact, crippling the US oil industry was probably 2nd only to boosting the fortunes of DeathToAmerica Iran among his régime's goals.

7367 2018-11-28 14:57:38 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Christians are too quiet and polite and timid. We need to be making our voices heard!
7368 2018-11-28 14:57:37 We can’t go up a lot with Trump bashing oil every second. He doesn’t get it
7369 2018-11-28 14:57:33 Think there are higher paying GIS jobs out there but much fewer. eg working in oil and gas or for the NSA, places some folks wouldn’t feel comfortable working perhaps.
7370 2018-11-28 14:57:31 Needs to hit oil in djeno for it to be worthwhile.
7371 2018-11-28 14:57:30 Oil priced in RUB is still 10% higher than it was at the 2008 peak...
7372 2018-11-28 14:57:17 Fuck yeah smh I like the flax seed black castor oil one 
7373 2018-11-28 14:57:14 Those predicting high oil seem to be nuts to me.

7375 2018-11-28 14:57:11 Don’t be that guy. We have thin Florida blood not thick Ohio motor oil blood like you. Lol (I love the weather just hassling you)
7376 2018-11-28 14:57:08 You are not only a snack oil salesman but not a truth teller. Science has never claim that humans came from a single man and woman.
7377 2018-11-28 14:57:03 I know your tactics that’s motor oil 
7378 2018-11-28 14:57:00 26歳記念に一緒に撮りました
7379 2018-11-28 14:56:49 Also, Hey Juls. I know u keep thinking thinking I am joe. Sara or an Anthem chick but I am sitting at the dealership waiting on an oil change if u would like to bring your lying nasty ass up here to harass me in-person but we know you won’t bc u r coward on a keyboard. #ResistU
7380 2018-11-28 14:56:46 Damn I love sesame oil 
7381 2018-11-28 14:56:44 really want some pancakes but like the ones with cardboard and engine oil

7384 2018-11-28 14:56:27 And covered the floor with OIL.  The 300 wing was my fave. I loved everything about it. LOL
7385 2018-11-28 14:56:23 That challenge has been there since 2017 :), but ofcourse your hero O’Brien has refused to honour it and you know y?Because he can’t cut people off in a live debate or ask his producer not to let the person through and can keep on selling his snake oil to his undiscerning sheep
7386 2018-11-28 14:56:13 New  sales/crude oil/fed/out/day low next 
7387 2018-11-28 14:56:13 Also, the downside of low oil prices is that we, collectively, go back to buying big trucks (with more profit margin for makers) instead of efficient cars. I caught an NPR piece on the radio talking about closing GM plants that made smaller cars. Because MURICA = TANKTRUKKS.
7388 2018-11-28 14:56:05 Trudeau won’t fight for oil- we all NEED oil, we all don’t need a GM product. I have driven VW for years and years
7389 2018-11-28 14:56:00 @CanadianTire Literally, the worst auto service I've ever experienced. I've never been more displeased with a company or have had a worse experience. For a simple tire change and oil change, my car was kept for 2 days even though I had an appointment.
7390 2018-11-28 14:55:53 Twister + baby oil = it's happening

7394 2018-11-28 14:55:34 1/2 It was a meal I made myself. I made a foil pack of asparagus, onion, and bell peppers with avocado oil seasoned with black pepper garlic salt and McCormick steak seasoning. Put that on the camp fire to start cooking. Then over the fire I pan fried two New York strip steaks.
7395 2018-11-28 14:55:32 Ang tagal ko nang sinasabi na magdi-Divisoria kami ng sibs ko. Ngayon, nung narinig ng parents ko uli, todo ayaw naman sila. Tapos sisingit si papa ng pera pang-change oil nya. Like, whaaaaaa? What the fuck?!

私も温泉ほりあててぇなぁ！
7398 2018-11-28 14:55:18 Only the outside one. We had an oil lamp in the bathroom which also gave a few degrees of heat if the door was kept shut.
7399 2018-11-28 14:55:15 I literally use coconut oil & olive oil for EVERYTHING
7400 2018-11-28 14:55:15 Is it true that SA could devalue USD by switching to another currency as standard for oil transactions? I've heard this is the reason why all US admins are powerless to truly confront Saud. Thanks for your time.
7401 2018-11-28 14:55:10 Meeting of Russia and Saudi Heafs ostensibly about Dead Kashoggi at G 20 is really for crude oil price jack up!
7402 2018-11-28 14:55:05 Agree completely. Yes it’s my heating oil.
7403 2018-11-28 14:55:04 Took a bath in epsom salt, aloe, and lavender oil, and now handmaidens are feeding me grapes while I hold court.

7404 2018-11-28 14:55:02 What makes a fat vegan? Overloading on processed snacks, and fried, vegetable oil heavy foods provide little weight loss advantages over a traditional meat diet. Only a diet full of diverse whole #plant-based foods provides the balance of nutrients, low-calorie protein, and carbs

7406 2018-11-28 14:54:54 Absolutely - I cooked the pearl barley in a stock made from bay leaves, garlic, celery and onion whilst steaming the broccoli over the pan. Then I chopped up all the herbs and mashed in some roast garlic and whisked that into a lemon oil vinaigrette. Chucked everything else in!

7408 2018-11-28 14:54:44 I think the oil is too much. It could prepare another pot of soup.
7409 2018-11-28 14:54:34 Production went up due to hydraulic fracturing technologies and Congress lifting the ban on oil & gas exports.  Obama opposed both.
7410 2018-11-28 14:54:29 i -love- oil painting whole heartedly but BITCH it hurts after a while

7412 2018-11-28 14:54:23 Unless we’re willing to give up the use of oil, our focus needs to be on safety, like double hulled tankers, not on shutting things down

7424 2018-11-28 14:53:32 Hilarious.  Obama’s admin did just about everything it could to kill oil and gas.  They just couldn’t do it.

7429 2018-11-28 14:53:11 Your a snake oil salesman that is making a huge circus out of this great country. People are starting to see through your nonsense. Impeach now! And take all your best people with you.@cnnbrk @FoxNews
7430 2018-11-28 14:53:10 Trucks, SUV’s and Crossovers are popular now because their increased fuel efficiency coupled with low oil prices makes them a bigger, safer more comfortable alternative to cars at minimal cost difference. Please stop talking.
7431 2018-11-28 14:53:07 California and Hollywood for Alberta and huge oil deposits...sounds like a fair trade to me!

It truly amazes me how America's allies can treat her so badly, yet at the same time demand her protection. Crazy.

7435 2018-11-28 14:53:01 As an oil and gas guy working in the most prolific region in America.... this is beyond laughable.  Thank Texans. 

Happened despite him, not because of him.

7437 2018-11-28 14:52:57 Its the opposite actually..there is an oil glut in the world market currently..too much oil has led to less demand and a drop in the oil price!
7438 2018-11-28 14:52:55 Motor oil too I bet
7439 2018-11-28 14:52:42 Literally wrote my story except I collapsed in my home, in my prime.

7440 2018-11-28 14:52:37 Why do people do things like this? It’s not because of the environment, it’s because they hate oil and gas companies.

7445 2018-11-28 14:52:10 Why can’t we question a man made product that is injected into our children?! They used peanut oil in vaccines which caused the peanut allergic epidemic. When u vaccine u don’t pass on immunity to ur child, making the human race weaker.big pharma.
7446 2018-11-28 14:52:08 he made it much more difficult to drill on public lands. much of the gain in oil production came from private lands during his admin.

7454 2018-11-28 14:51:21 Its some rich oil guy vs a crazy guy with a bit of money
7455 2018-11-28 14:51:19 Bernie used DNC resources in 2016...
The DNC takes money from Oil companies and Hedge funds.  
So, when it mattered, Bernie used those same donor funds too.
7456 2018-11-28 14:51:17 Lotion isn’t enough use oil
7457 2018-11-28 14:51:12 Let's say 300 ppl at least paid, were talking of 9,750,000 or there about
7458 2018-11-28 14:51:06 Even if the US uses zero oil domestically, if someone *else* is consuming oil, the US benefits if we produce it.
7459 2018-11-28 14:51:05 And would a scientist make LESS if he or she came out and utterly disproved global warming? 
On top of all the speaking engagements and funding from oil companies, they'd be a legitimate scientific hero.
Both professional and financial incentives are to expose the fraud.
7460 2018-11-28 14:51:00 Oil won’t end anytime in the next 50 years.. the demand should drop. But oil even if rarely used as a fuel source, will still be required in the 10’s of millions of barrels for producing so many things we use in our daily lives.
7461 2018-11-28 14:50:59 ネッコ　　猫　ねこ　　ねーーーこーーーー
7462 2018-11-28 14:50:58 @ErikSTownsend Have you or anyone reading this run across any analysis of US carbon tax proposals and how they'd effect the domestic oil industry? It seems such policies are possible in the future and I haven't run into any analysis of the potential impact.

7470 2018-11-28 14:50:00 Saudi Energy Minister, Khalid al-Falih told reporters today that they will do whatever it takes to end crude oil volatility, but only if everyone works together.
7471 2018-11-28 14:50:00 Pants on fire.

I remeber it quite differently.  NObama was always standing in the way of anything that produced oil.  Remember the pipeline to Canada that he rejected?  He only supported alternative energy sources. He's a blatant lier, and has no real legacy
7472 2018-11-28 14:49:58 Yep, #TMX is the dog that won't hunt. US oil interests are making a killing on the differential (oil by rail into Montana) and the Cdn taxpaying public is out $bils in lost royalties.

7477 2018-11-28 14:49:34 this economy requires a steady diet of cardboard and synthetic oil

7483 2018-11-28 14:49:10 I'm not against voting for Bernie... I like progressive ideas.  But to say there are no differences between Trump and any other Dems (anf therefore justifies not voting Dem) is just moronic.

(Btw, Bernie used DNC resources in 2016, and DNC receives Oil donations, so.....)
7484 2018-11-28 14:49:08 I’m like yummm how’s that blue tansy oil taste  kissing off my expensive ass products.
7485 2018-11-28 14:49:01 Venezuela? Yeah, it's hard to argue that what's going on there is left-wing at all. It's the collapse of a petrostate that happened to be left-wing -- a good warning for leftists who think oil and liberation can coexist.
7486 2018-11-28 14:48:55 Gas guzzling cars of course to help your big donor oil companies. Taking us back socially and fiscally and innnovatively to the 50s
7487 2018-11-28 14:48:55 Yes, we know about past swings, and we know about the massive extinction events that came with them, and we know this one is happening far faster, and we know why, and we know we can slow it down & maybe even reverse it, and we know that would affect oil profits, so...do nothing.
7488 2018-11-28 14:48:54 Buy oil...I will rub ur body nicely

7491 2018-11-28 14:48:45 Read your surprises. Thanks! Why is the Fed increasing rates which negatively impact corporate bonds. Inflation is not a pressing concern giving the drop in oil. The Fed has to be concerned with the stock market! 200 more pips to the downside, objective met.
7492 2018-11-28 14:48:45 Oil still an issue; and RTY seems to have stalled out already without rallying that much from last week’s low.

7502 2018-11-28 14:48:10 does anyone else obsessively watch that video where they pour motor oil on pancakes and shit and is in disbelief every time they watch it??? or am I just weird
7503 2018-11-28 14:48:02 @exxonmobil @Shell big oil...there are other alternatives without needing to literally rape the planet and pollute its oceans even more than theh are already enduring. Please wake the hell up!!!!!
7504 2018-11-28 14:47:59 It’s snake oil

7508 2018-11-28 14:47:38 Scotland only props up England with oil, whisky, tourism, agricultural exports...why do they care Tories are fkg up their future, huh?
7509 2018-11-28 14:47:36 You work in the oil business so I now understand why you like deregulation. Regulations are there to keep people in check from doing things that hurt the general good. Oil people and businesses don’t like it because it costs them money. All those regulations will be back on soon!
7510 2018-11-28 14:47:31 You have two sides, Natalie
7511 2018-11-28 14:47:27 I wish @CNN and the rest of the news media would stop falsely playing this as being two sided. It's not, Their reporters need to call out these false accusations of scientists AND ask if oil companies are in it to make profit and if they're at all biased.
7512 2018-11-28 14:47:20 Good Morning Everyone!! Question~CBD oil, reputable company , suggestions? Any help be greatly appreciated 
7513 2018-11-28 14:47:18 Overdependency on oil has slowed down the development of alternative sources of energy, government needs to put in place mechanisms that will aid renewable energy development in Nigeria to attract investment in renewable energy #ClimateWednesday #fossilfuel
7514 2018-11-28 14:47:16 Sad when you’re subject to more environmental scrutiny to install a residential oil tank than a massive aquaculture project.
7515 2018-11-28 14:47:15 Girl I get my oil changed, tires rotated and fluids topped off faithfully! I need my car to last a long as possible!
7516 2018-11-28 14:47:13 Because oil is still a world traded commodity it still funds terrorism and directs our middle east diolomacy... Only by eliminating it as a relic of the past will the middle east slink back to obscurity
7517 2018-11-28 14:47:11 Kieran, you think that’s bad. Well, it will be Scottish Oil that will be paying for #Brexit. Which is another slap in the face for all present & future generations of Scots.  #DissolveTheUKUnion

7523 2018-11-28 14:46:59 AGW is a hoax. Follow the money. Who depends on the research money? What happens if it is proven false? The money and prestige go away. Kind of like the #ClintonFoundation.  Tobacco and Oil researchers derided but the lure of all that power is too much to walk away from isn’t it?

7529 2018-11-28 14:46:35 So rediculous!
During Obama's regime, rhe oil companies were all set to expand because they saw the need!
Obama blocked them at every turn, including pipelines!
Trump opened the valves!

7544 2018-11-28 14:45:34 Obama in Houston last night said he is the reason America is number one in oil and gas production can’t make this BS up
7545 2018-11-28 14:45:33 I agree that Name Constraints should be used more widely, even it not all clients support them well yet. I'm not sure that it would have helped here if the developers didn't do the right thing, as side-loaded CAs aren't readily distinguishable between Enterprise and snake oil.
7546 2018-11-28 14:45:31 Got a cool mist and a warm steam humidifier running, as well as my essential oil diffuser. Been putting that netipot to work and loading up on ACV, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne and honey. Clearing this cold by any means necessary

7555 2018-11-28 14:44:55 They aren’t just screaming for a pipeline, for some reason they think we can stop importing foreign oil and process our oil here. But their logic is not sound, the pipelines are meant to ship our oil somewhere else, to process. What are we going to use and at what price?

7558 2018-11-28 14:44:51 Well, my mother used to make me take Cod Liver Oil for years as a child and I was never sick. Once I stopped taking it is when I started to get colds a lot.
7559 2018-11-28 14:44:50 And yet scientists overwhelmingly agree today's nuclear is clean safe and incredibly affordable relative to oil. Climate change can be solved with innovative atomic, without requiring global treaties or socialist trade policies. Spread the word!

 Cheapest gas in America:
Texas is 1.69 a gallon 

So who makes the most profit from crude oil?   ... our government
7561 2018-11-28 14:44:22 Corporation tax
Tested on animals still
Palm oil
Plant movement abroad 
Why would i show interest
7562 2018-11-28 14:44:21 こういう流れだと、よく気にしちゃってダイエットとか始めちゃったりってのがよく見られるんですけどね…！太っても気にしないと…
7563 2018-11-28 14:44:15 No oil...
7564 2018-11-28 14:44:09 @answerswithjoe and during the gulf oil spill mycologist Paul Stamets tested (successfully) a floating barrier of oyster mushroom (pleurotus ostreus) mycelia in brackish water (part salt) that consumed crude oil and turned it into biomass for nearby wildlife.
7565 2018-11-28 14:44:09 Clearly this President doesn’t care about truth and his snake oil user followers are conditioned to only believe what he tells them.  Sad state of affairs.
7566 2018-11-28 14:44:06 Saudi sovereignty is artifact of American power projection in Middle East. They sit on that oil because democracies don't have stomach for empire, but US had the sense not to surrender suzerainty over the resource. Problem is US forgot why Saudis permitted to rule in first place.
7567 2018-11-28 14:44:05 we are off Mr P....
strap our seat belts 
7568 2018-11-28 14:44:04 Should have CBC technicians work on building pipelines. Do a lot better job finding solutions to problems than politicians! (Information flow, oil flow... about the same thing.)
7569 2018-11-28 14:43:45 I was gonna come out there for work in the oil field but ND is too far 
7570 2018-11-28 14:43:45 ??? the oil ?? I put it on my face and it don’t lol

7572 2018-11-28 14:43:40 Also, oil and coal are not the only fossil fuels we use in the US.

7574 2018-11-28 14:43:33 I read that on buzzfeed but my forehead isn’t very pimple prone in general because it got sunburnt so many times it just doesn’t produce any excessive oil anymore (or whatever it is that skin produces that causes pimples) also my forehead is so big covering it would be nice sjdjd
7575 2018-11-28 14:43:32 If you ever need an oil change or just need an inspection of your car, go to Havoline in Jasper. They’re at the nicest guys and they really helped with making my car better!

7580 2018-11-28 14:43:23 If i know how to change a oil in a car...i feel like my man should know how too
7581 2018-11-28 14:43:16 Just wash your face daily with soap and water,don't pop your pimples and use teatree oil scrub sometimes.
7582 2018-11-28 14:43:09 Oil level also hit. Same rules apply.
7583 2018-11-28 14:43:01 OIL: Oil rose further above $60 a barrel, supported by expectations that OPEC and its partners will next week decide to curb supply and helped by a drop in North Sea output.
7584 2018-11-28 14:42:56 Ppl are so dumb to go listen to these snake oil Clintons, they should be in prison
7585 2018-11-28 14:42:56 @AndrewScheer Hey, Mucinex Guy, Canada has a massive carbon footprint (who are you fooling?). Also, why would you prop up a dying oil industry? There are numerous proven technologies that can generate electricity, and jobs, without killing everything. Arrested development much?
7586 2018-11-28 14:42:50 本人は気にしていないもよう
7587 2018-11-28 14:42:50 The difference being that England would have to pay for the water/elec,,ect,ect.
Fifty years on and water will be worth more than oil.
7588 2018-11-28 14:42:46 es of course Scotland would get more money from oil than they do now,does not mean they would be better off independent.only two parts of the UK produce more per person than they receive,London & South East,all other parts of the U.K. receive more per person than they contribute

7598 2018-11-28 14:42:22 His supporter made millions shipping oil by rail.  Many oil spills not a peep from the press.
7599 2018-11-28 14:42:19 He wanted gas to be at $5 per gallon so that it would be cost prohibitive.  Now he says he is a champion of being a dominate oil producer?
7600 2018-11-28 14:42:18 I've been reading about CBD oil and apparently there are a lot of companies making and selling this stuff and it seems to be totally unregulated.  Do you know a reputable company?

7609 2018-11-28 14:41:26 Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday his country would not cut oil output on its own to stabilise the market, as OPEC peer Nigeria said it was too early to signal whether it would take part in any decision to reduce production.
7610 2018-11-28 14:41:25 Is PK taking a stand that there should be no more drilling for Oil & Gas. If not what exactly he is proposing as an outcome? Atleast do you know

7614 2018-11-28 14:41:08 Trump is in bed with Big Oil and portions of his base are in coal country, so he has to tell them crap they want to hear.

7622 2018-11-28 14:39:46 Actually, most of the policies that led to the USA significantly increasing oil production were implemented during George W. Bush’s presidency.  We should thank him.
7623 2018-11-28 14:39:46 That's difficult since most burger joints sale imitation beef injected/inundated with grease.  Fries are cooked in week old oil. And, they microwave fries to meet orders that already been sitting for a few hours.  Best Burger Joints are  #Homemade

7626 2018-11-28 14:39:35 If most of worlds oil is priced off of North Sea then surely that is not a remote connection. An increase in underlying price will mean higher prices all round esp in Asian markets where most of their imports are priced off Brent

7648 2018-11-28 14:38:02 Norway joined EFTA/EEA after a 52/48 (sound familiar?) ref result in 1994. This, it was decided, reflected the closeness of the result. Having a small population and a US$ 1 trillion sovereign wealth fund thanks to oil means EU membership is not desired by most.
7649 2018-11-28 14:37:57 Either that or we could get our shale oil projects going and get a piece of the pie.
7650 2018-11-28 14:37:49 Let’s get this                                          1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
7651 2018-11-28 14:37:44 None of them will.  The Environmental Impact Report process and associated lawsuits will BK them.  Monorail snake oil won’t work in a coastal city.
7652 2018-11-28 14:37:36 Can I have the left over castor oil! Thank you.
7653 2018-11-28 14:37:29 5555555555 ว่าตัวเอง ?
7654 2018-11-28 14:37:28 And next up, the CEO of Big Oil Corp (TM) and the CEO of Big Coal Corp. (TM) debate climate change, and how urgent the need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
7655 2018-11-28 14:37:26 Hi sweet girl. Have you tried cbd oil ? I am so excited its helping me..I can move better,less pain and sleeping better. I hate hurting..i don't want anyone to hurt
7656 2018-11-28 14:37:09 You niggas cardboard and motor oil 
7657 2018-11-28 14:37:08 Even if you work out, make sure to eat healthy food to sustain your body's needed nutrients, and always drink warm water. Refrain from drinking ice cold water to avoid the oil in solidifying inside your body, ok? Love you.
7658 2018-11-28 14:37:08 If you understood GERS you would realise we do “get”
all of “our” oil. It’s what the geographical share is.
7659 2018-11-28 14:37:04 هههههههههههههههه
7660 2018-11-28 14:37:02 @kady  nice picture of grain cars being loaded.  It has been reported that the amount of oil transported by train will double next year.  This raises the thought - how much capacity is there on the rail lines?   And what takes precedence heading west to Vancouver; Oil or Grain?
7661 2018-11-28 14:37:02 chocolate bar is the new oil HAHAHAHA
7662 2018-11-28 14:37:00 Except all of our true allies have made the same conclusion and proposed sanctions. Trump has not because once again Saudi oil is worth more than America's integrity. Bush 43 made the same choice after 9/11.
7663 2018-11-28 14:36:59 “BUT CLIMATE SCIENTISTS ARE PAID TO PROMOTE CLIMATE CHANGE THEORIES” scream @GOP politicians who are *literally* being paid by oil companies.
7664 2018-11-28 14:36:45 Bag of rice didn’t just go up in price if d looters didn’t loot Nigeria up when we had more than enough revenue from oil. We were relying so much on smuggled foreign rice. PMB/PYO are the best team. No free monies again for looters and their hangers-on. Let’s grow what we eat!
7665 2018-11-28 14:36:37 らいぞうくんだ
7666 2018-11-28 14:36:37 What's easier digging coal and drilling oil or running screw compressors and harnessing buoyancy?
7667 2018-11-28 14:36:32 Always thought that concern was silly -- biofuels are emergency food in a global food catastrophe.  Suspect the biofuel economy will mostly replace oil when the cheap sources are exhausted, but who knows.
7668 2018-11-28 14:36:31 ぐにゃぐにゃさん持ってないのか
7669 2018-11-28 14:36:24 Itu bkn modal PRU13 ka?  Base on crued oil price at that time....

PRU4 rsnya mcm xde sembang turun minyak...

Hanya mention harga minyak bersasar jer kot..
7670 2018-11-28 14:36:16 Iceland didn’t even remove Palm Oil from its products

7674 2018-11-28 14:36:00 Angus, the slices that produce the oil, are they seal fat from under the skin ? do you know ?
7675 2018-11-28 14:35:56 Fact Check on #GOP - Researchers working in climate change do not receive large paychecks, nor do they get rich from grants. In addition, research from oil companies have for years affirm scientific consensus on climate change. #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsAnElectionissue
7676 2018-11-28 14:35:49 Car is definitely encased in ice gonna run it a few minutes, hopefully heat it up and I need to plan an oil change because my car now says an oil change is required >.<
7677 2018-11-28 14:35:44 A jerican like d one pipo use fetch water or store oil.
7678 2018-11-28 14:35:36 This isn’t a reality show. It’s the USA. Trump is embarrassing this great country. Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie. He has no morals no ethics. Why is Ivanka in the WH? Snake oil salesmen. Impeach now!
7679 2018-11-28 14:35:35 Not to mention, craft paint doesn't stick to glass, so before you know it, all the paint would be chipped off. 

"Lamp" in my house growing up was a hurricane lamp, that we lit every time the power went out. I still keep them all around my house, full of lamp oil and ready to go.
7680 2018-11-28 14:35:33 I think CaptGravy is pointing out that it is naive to think it is even possible to keep oil money out of committee. So they don't accept money from energy company PACs. They have to raise money somehow. What about the millions of individuals who work in energy companies?
7681 2018-11-28 14:35:31 Always telling this stupid answer and making all Op5/5t users fools and giving updates to new models great work guys keep it up not only pie still there is camera issue is there like oil effect in op5t I know op is least bothered waste brand and frustrated with ur useless updates

7685 2018-11-28 14:35:23 It had nothing to do with Oliver’s denialism! When you respond deux ex machina to a question about climate denial with talking points about “ethical oil” you can expect some mockery. ;)

7688 2018-11-28 14:35:04 The real cost of climate change? Your climate hysteria government policies.
Carbon dioxide taxes that make Canadian production uncompetitive. 
Active opposition to pipelines while importing foreign oil. 
Billions of dollars in lost opportunities. 
Crippled businesses.
7689 2018-11-28 14:34:59 coconut oil doesn’t work, i’ve tried everything :( i’ve been bleaching my hair since i was 15 so i just need to give it a rest i guess
7690 2018-11-28 14:34:58 only thing getting me through this double is my oil pen 
7691 2018-11-28 14:34:51 How is it him when he was against Oil and drilling
7692 2018-11-28 14:34:48 Electric cars don't need much gas and oil....hmm?
7693 2018-11-28 14:34:42 Hmmmm then I wonder why Trump was bragging that he’s the one keeping oil prices low and the he can get them lower.
7694 2018-11-28 14:34:38 @GuPuds Haven't had a reply to my query re 'no added palm oil' on your hazelnut spread. Does it contain palm oil or not please? @PalmOilProject @PalmOilFreeCert
7695 2018-11-28 14:34:37 a) stop using Palm Oil and killing orangutans

b) pay your taxes like you used to
7696 2018-11-28 14:34:36 For real though, once you work with an oil company and taste the money, you can't fit in anywhere! Every other job offer looks like trash! 
7697 2018-11-28 14:34:34 Last week a lorry driver told me if I worked harder, maybe I could afford a car. I laughed at his face and said I was taking no financial advice from a lorry driver. (Note: I'm a Chartered Engineer in the Oil & Gas industry)
7698 2018-11-28 14:34:30 Just walked by one of those video trucks, yknow, the ones with the video screens on the back that usually play movie trailers? Yeah. Only this one had a small animation saying to “stop buying Saudi oil” and seems to have been put there by Ontario Proud, as the video says.
7699 2018-11-28 14:34:25 44 said HE created U.S. oil boon and told stock holders to thank HIM for the profits. Dude talks about himself AALOTT!
7700 2018-11-28 14:34:22 There is only one reason any sane person would deny climate change. Big Oil owns them. Having said that, I’m not at all certain that Trump IS sane. I think we have a looney tunes in charge of our government.
7701 2018-11-28 14:34:21 We’re now the largest oil producer not because of Obamas policies but despite them.
7702 2018-11-28 14:34:20 สึ้เด้น้อ

7710 2018-11-28 14:33:53 Starting my day off with these edibles and some oil from my pen 
7711 2018-11-28 14:33:51 putting shale drillers out of bus doesn’t remove the oil from the ground. prices will drop & someone will take it out. Seems like everyone expected at least a 1M barrel cut. Now? Does the OPEC source comes from a country that needs $50 oil or $80. RB isn’t the same for everyone
7712 2018-11-28 14:33:50 is this what Oil money does to you
7713 2018-11-28 14:33:47 IT’S 40 years past the time to quit the United Nations. We fund  welfare for the entire earth. The UN would turn the entire earth into a third world country. Borders are necessary to prevent this. Oil brought the MIDDLE EAST from medieval times but with modern weapons to this.
7714 2018-11-28 14:33:35 Thanks!  It was newly washed, it usually looks like a bottle of oil on top of my head. I apprichiate the compliment 
7715 2018-11-28 14:33:31 สะดุ้งอะพี่ 555 ไม่ทันตั้งตัว
7716 2018-11-28 14:33:24 This is a joke. Why it doesnt drop by R3.00 a litter atlist. I mean the rand is stronger than it was  and the oil has droped so much. But just a small change it will jump up by R2 and followed by R1 and another R1
7717 2018-11-28 14:33:18 Trump voters are suckers. They bought that snake oil, now they can live with the consequences.
7718 2018-11-28 14:33:18 Don't think they've ever been richest. Lately they've been hurting while oil prices have been low.

7720 2018-11-28 14:33:04 Every time we question our partnership they cut oil prices, we are like heroin addicts. Can’t help ourselves.
7721 2018-11-28 14:33:03 Oil refineries also have negative environmental impacts, including air / water pollution. #climatewed #fossilfuels

7727 2018-11-28 14:32:14 Dear girl..have you tried cbd oil? I thought nothing would help but I have been using the oil for over a month and I can't believe it.  My pain is better,feeling better and sleeping better.
7728 2018-11-28 14:31:58 #AAOG no brainer down here...now let's see the oil!
7729 2018-11-28 14:31:57 The oil biz in Canada is a dying biz under any govt. Poorly managed by both private sector and incompetent provincial Tory govts. Look at Norway. Look at Alberta. Why does the rest of Canada not care about AB? They vote Tory. This discounts them from a political POV. Written off.
7730 2018-11-28 14:31:50 I’ve done a lot of research on it and I’ve heard that it’s really good! I give my two catahoulas treats with cbd oil in them to chill them out
7731 2018-11-28 14:31:50 Trump is shamelessly using Israel as an excuse to keep American troops in Syria. This is complete lie! America produces most of its oil but if Saudis decide to cut production bc of Iran threat America will lose billions. This already happened before, and lots if people lost jobs.

7738 2018-11-28 14:31:23 The IEA secretly funded by tobacco and oil companies , are leaving free magazines in schools around the country. Jehovah's witnesses do that. They are also a weird secretive cult ...
7739 2018-11-28 14:31:15 Any government, Scotland or Britain does not get profit from the oil. It gets tax on the profits of oil companies and vat on sales. The profits from the oil industry belong to the businesses that extract and refine it.

7741 2018-11-28 14:31:10 They taste DELICIOUS. You suck the peas out, the oil-haldi-namak mix on the chilka tastes divine.

Of course, you throw the chilka away. Sorry for not remembering what chilka is called in English.
7742 2018-11-28 14:31:08 FWIW I say that as someone who actually works in the oil & gas industry and would probably be out of a job if we completely transitioned off. But it's worth it, and I'm not worried as I made sure to have marketable skills.
7743 2018-11-28 14:31:03 Yes, the pepper oil is hot and will make the eyes feel like they are burning. It’s the friction of the molecules crossing the barrier.
7744 2018-11-28 14:30:59 And the corporations, hidden $$ interest, and governments also need to follow the same prop pat as these items, but they don’t. Why? Because they can condition you with a TV, they can condition you with oil and gas, and they can condition you with your phone.

7745 2018-11-28 14:30:56 Yeah, I use cleansing oil first and then do the second cleanse with my normal wash.

The largest oil and gas contributors during the 2008 election cycle to Obama.
7752 2018-11-28 14:30:35 Yes this is true.They are building more coal plants but at the same time increasing their renewable energy capacity. They sold more Electric cars than any other country. It's also because they don't have oil in their territories and rely on the middle East. It's more of a need.

7760 2018-11-28 14:29:47 I'm honestly super-skeptical about the quality of CBD oil available outside of a dispensary. I've worked in both the vape and medical marijuana industries and can tell you that the range of quality (the difference between 'good' and 'absolute shit') is SEVERE.
7761 2018-11-28 14:29:31 The #83kbae thing is just a social experiment , A PR stunt, after reading the story, a lot of things didn't add up so my conclusion.
7762 2018-11-28 14:29:25 Wake up Justin.... you react so fast when the the plant in Ontario is going to be closed that affects 2500. What about the 100 K plus in Alberta that are affected with the oil industry. The pipeline you failed to support. Your actions have accounted to billions being lost.
7763 2018-11-28 14:29:20 I don’t even want to say the old way i used to get the oil out of a cartridge but someone told me to just boil it lmao. Potheads are so smart. Wow I’m embarrassed.
7764 2018-11-28 14:29:11 (2/2) please do a little research and make an informed decision. Animal agriculture does more harm than palm oil, that is a fact. We are forcing sentient beings to die for us when there is simply no reason. How can we justify that in today’s society.
7765 2018-11-28 14:29:06 Yes I stare at an oil painting I did of me and Daveed together whenever I'm sad

No I'm not obsessed with him
7766 2018-11-28 14:29:05 Sometimes I just need, ehhhh, want a man around so he can do some of the boy things I don’t wana do....like check my oil...it’s too cold 
7767 2018-11-28 14:28:58 Ima give you a booty rub w/ coconut oil 
7768 2018-11-28 14:28:57 Let me get up and get a oil change 
7769 2018-11-28 14:28:46 This guy... 

Not like he spent his whole admin stonewalling anything with fossil fuels involved& signed the Paris agreement.

Oil prices went sky high, that is what caused the fracking boom @BarackObama's policies did nothing but hurt oil exploration & extraction.

JackA$$
7770 2018-11-28 14:28:31 Politics and personalities aside, it's not inconsistent to be for policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and policies to promote domestic oil production.

7774 2018-11-28 14:27:51 I’d like to see you in oil and a bikini 
7775 2018-11-28 14:27:45 There’s *so much money* to be made in renewables.

#1 it must be the future, obviously.
#2 we have the ability to power w/renewables now.
#3 non-renewables will run out.
#4 big oil and big coal want their money, and Congress can be bought (@GOP)

Renewables are the only answer.
7776 2018-11-28 14:27:44 Ladies they’re really clowing us...please don’t tell me y’all really out here not getting oil changes, tire rotations, your brakes and things checked...do your tires at least have air in them?
7777 2018-11-28 14:27:37 Hell yeah! Fuck Texas and their economy because they used to be Mexico! We don't need them or their oil and gas!

7783 2018-11-28 14:27:14 Nope, it doesn't have to be, if you stay away from coconut oil and other high SFA oils you can do keto on a plant based diet while still limiting SFA to >15% of calories, @unnaturalvegan did a keto experiment a few years ago in a similar manner
7784 2018-11-28 14:27:09 I am somehow inside a giant, ancient palace. The cafe has transformed into this gilded, sparkling place, with huge oil paintings on the wall.

7786 2018-11-28 14:26:47 You know what would really diversify our economy?.... pipelines which would ensure stable markets for our oil. There is no diversification without stability...

7802 2018-11-28 14:25:42 Then also get rid of the tax advantages to oil & gas exploration that date back to the 1920s.  Can you show the data that subsidies caused job loss and slower growth?
7803 2018-11-28 14:25:29 This should be a warning to our oil industry. Market will shift to EVs quickly resulting in stranded assets in Alberta. No need for any more pipelines, that's for sure.

7814 2018-11-28 14:24:54 He hated that we used so much oil. That's ok let him dream on ppl know the truth
7815 2018-11-28 14:24:51 It would be irresponsible for him to reduce fuel prices IMO. The economists want full deregulation of the oil industry and Govt is not allowing it. If he allows it we will have to pay more for petrol like N200k). Right now NNPC is bearing the difference (under recovery)
7816 2018-11-28 14:24:33 Welp, you know it's going to be a bad day when it starts with spilling an entire bottle of @TrilogyProducts face oil in the trash...

7821 2018-11-28 14:24:18 The PM and his Principal Secretary have one objective - shut down oil industry and coal mining.  Then transfer Alberta’s remaining wealth to the East.   The wealthy out of touch ruling class does not care about displaced workers.
7822 2018-11-28 14:24:17 I listened to his head of energy attack the safety of rail transport of oil. His admin was concurrently engaged in specious attacks on Keystone. And the EPA expanded envir impact statement on nat gas to country of use to block it. This is total BS

7869 2018-11-28 14:20:36 Iraq was destabilised in the name of fighting terror yet the main aim was privatisation and looting of oil fields.
7870 2018-11-28 14:20:26 The Wall Street bank, however, says the current botched environment for oil prices is unsustainable and predicts the situation will correct with an OPEC production cut when the cartel meets on December 6, regardless of Trump’s threats.
7871 2018-11-28 14:20:21 When we used that oil, we brought most of the world out of abject poverty.
7872 2018-11-28 14:20:21 Obama said that we couldn't drill our way to energy independence and now wants to take credit for doing what he said couldn't be done. Oil industry developed shale oil and gas technologies and reserves despite his opposition, not with his support. @seanmdav

7879 2018-11-28 14:19:43 Whats that kannabis oil?
7880 2018-11-28 14:19:40 Could it be that cheap Canadian oil is in greater demand than more expensive non-Canadian oil because that is the way an international commodity "market" is supposed to work?

8058 2018-11-28 14:08:31 Shit.. Thank you, Obama? For holding both feet on the brake pedal for 8 years? You did everything thing you could to hold oil production back.. Thankfully you had no control of private land..

8060 2018-11-28 14:08:22 The other thing I've been thinking about is that our economic assumptions of the global oil market are outdated and overstate KSA's ability to control price. Shale is so price elastic by comparison to conventional that it limits OPEC's monopoly power in all but extreme cases.

8063 2018-11-28 14:08:11 The. Why after teaching us in the 80s gov do nothing, why are oil and coal still used when we have wind and today power at our disposal...we could have changed how things are powered a long time ago. And why was there never any alternative to wooden furniture in our homes!

It's a difference of speculative vs. growth-based investors. Only an issue if we're interest in pipeline/innovative R&D & ROI.

8096 2018-11-28 14:05:37 If it is real then why after teaching us in schools in 80s did they do nothing, why when Vauxhall created a H2o car in 2008 it wasnt manufactured and why are good still using oil etc when we can create tidal power?! Simple money and profits

8139 2018-11-28 14:02:07 Sure, without a doubt this is mostly inefficient at this stage. But we'll never develop the technology to achieve the efficiency without the investment. The work it takes to extract oil and refine it, I'm sure this presented its own efficiency issues in the beginning.

8194 2018-11-28 13:57:28 Ummmm did he see oil prices when he was in office

Oil is losing traction - slip-sliding away, as it were. $50 appears to be  Support
AAPL is "trying" to recover, but has a lot of ground to make up.
8202 2018-11-28 13:56:54 Coal plants are the largest producers of carbon emissions, which contribute to global warming. Oil hurts the planet too. Each year in America alone, over one million gallons of petroleum spill into waterways, oceans, and groundwater. That’s why solar power is so important guys!
8203 2018-11-28 13:56:49 Out of his 78 million in donations, in the big ole oil and gas state of Texas, O'Rourke received $429k and has never voted in favor of "big oil." Why not mention that clean energy and education donators dwarfed "big oil" in donations?

8205 2018-11-28 13:56:46 Do you all really think they care about your opinions?  “stop using palm oil”, “pay ur taxes”, “it tastes worse after the takeover”. Stop kidding yourselves! If u don’t condone it just stop using it. Simples. 
8206 2018-11-28 13:56:42 So he worked like hell to shut down all fossil fuel extraction and use in the US. And now he wants to be thanked and credited for the US being the largest oil producer? Yup, sounds about right.

8210 2018-11-28 13:56:18 As Trump makes five minute decisions following each tantrum, families will suffer from job loss. These tariffs are steep and thoughtless. Auto industry and oil & gas will have to make tough decisions. Hope for his supporters, this is a reflection of greatness in America.
8211 2018-11-28 13:56:15 It's always on at every oil change place. Like do they have some sort of weird sponsorship where oil change places can only play fox? Like how Beyonce can only be seen drinking Pepsi products

8217 2018-11-28 13:55:30 The military doesn't simply buy planes from aerospace companies, it decides the winners and losers. It also decides winners and losers when giving oil companies and farmers billions of dollars in subsidies.

The government bailing out banks prevented a global economic collapse.
8218 2018-11-28 13:55:28 As with all early tech it’s not perfect, or quite as efficient as the oil industry — but is about to leapfrog coal/natural gas. It’ll do the same to oil in a decade. It needs subsidies now.
8219 2018-11-28 13:55:25 Of course the red oil had to be extra
8220 2018-11-28 13:55:25 The world is funny af..
If the government finds diamond  or oil in your backward, it's governments property. But if they find drugs, it's yours. 

Yea!!
8221 2018-11-28 13:55:24 Pure propaganda to blame Venezuela. No mention of sanctions or US imperialism, or the oil war. Nothing.
8222 2018-11-28 13:55:23 It's not worth debating, your position is so absurd;  I can't spend any more time on it.  Curious, though:  Do you own a coal mine? Oil field?  Otherwise WHY cling with such fervor to obvious lies and misinformation?
8223 2018-11-28 13:55:20 Delusional is the word.  This man fought drilling and oil exploration.
8224 2018-11-28 13:55:18 The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia and now produces more oil and natural gas than any other country in the world.

8226 2018-11-28 13:55:06 This article is full of lies. Tesla is actively working on bringing lower cost EVs to market. The subsidies to Big Oil and Big ICE needs to stop.

8248 2018-11-28 13:53:47 I don’t mind at all. I started with a layer of Dawnstone, wash the whole thing with nuln oil. Then add a layer of XV-88 in the center of the pelt leaving some of the dawnstone along the edges exposed. After that I washed the pelt with Agrax Earthshade.

8255 2018-11-28 13:53:21 Pretty sure that would be collision on the level of OPEC. The free market should determine oil production.
8256 2018-11-28 13:53:17 Sadly it’s about money & oil over human life. Shameful on the part of our elected officials doesn’t even begin to describe it.
8257 2018-11-28 13:53:08 Rockerfeller, who made his money in oil is a founder of the Club of Rome who are the ones driving the man made warming scam via the UN.  It's a lot more than climate science.

8268 2018-11-28 13:52:14 i stared at the menu for five long minutes. 
about to give up, i enquired of a lovely lady nearby. 

"what, pray tell, does evoo mean, fellow diner?" 
she smiled as she might at a curious grandson, 

extra virgin olive oil. 

of course, i laughed, 
as if i'd known it all along
8269 2018-11-28 13:52:10 Sure it does! I willingly admit I know nothing about the oil industry except they are ruining this world. Your knowledge, or lack of, comes from people wanting you to believe they’re false view so they gain power and money. Oil industry? That explains a lot about your ignorance!
8270 2018-11-28 13:52:09 I don't care about your gutter-mouth neither do I care about your equity, but I have every right to detect and call out a daft comment. In 2019, the lawlessness of the APC and their zeal to gag freedom of expressions will be roundly defeated by Nigerians. It's a matter of time.
8271 2018-11-28 13:52:02 LMAO!
8272 2018-11-28 13:51:51 That’s hilarious because Forbes Magazine proved the vast majority of the increase in U.S. oil production occurred on private land during the Obama Admin. Meaning, he had no impact whatsoever on domestic oil production. Nice try Ms. Obama.

He is a deluded narcissist. He should be quiet and go away.
8279 2018-11-28 13:51:05 mhmm motor oil and biscuits this morning really did hit the spot
8280 2018-11-28 13:51:04 yes and more capacity will lower the world market price further. Oil doesn't have an expiry date. if extraction is moderated with the knowledge that the price will increase again future revenues will be even better. but our economic model is exploit now drill now no foresight.

8288 2018-11-28 13:49:57 I have a dilemma. I need a car for a growing family of 5. I WILL not compromise my safety and will NOT support the oil industry any longer. Comfort and technology is important but priority. The X is above our price range but I have until May to find a way to afford it.

8300 2018-11-28 13:49:11 Wrong. America's growth in oil/gas production happened under his watch.

You're just a snowflake who can't admit it that's all.

8306 2018-11-28 13:48:32 Not to mention the royalties the government makes of every barrel of oil.  Pays for hospitals and education and all the social programs.  It is unreal how a fellow Canadian like yourself enjoys watching people lose money and jobs.  Left wing hate.
8307 2018-11-28 13:48:24 No way, that a$$ tried his damnedest to stop oil production and now he wants to claim it as his work! This man is narcissistic beyond any measure!

8313 2018-11-28 13:48:05 Actually, it happened during his presidency. 

So if conservatives wanna give credit to trump for things he has nothing to do with like good economy and stock market, you need to give obama credit for growing domestic oil production

you dont get both just bc you're a snowflake

8323 2018-11-28 13:47:26 So, according to your analogy, he should have prevented oil production??  Or is he like a Head Coach personally taking credit for everything the players accomplish.
8324 2018-11-28 13:47:25 This rich greedy thieves made all mess in the middle east - not for justice, prosperity or true democracy , only for oil. AMERICA NUMBER ONE . YES IS TRUE , BUT HOW DO THAT. Who cares for millons death people in the middle east. ONLY MONEY AND POWER IS GOOD . BRAVO AMERICA .
8325 2018-11-28 13:47:23 The Dems won't do it when they get big oil money.  Better to form a new party.  Forget the Dems.

8331 2018-11-28 13:46:59 Taxes my friend. Oil marketers collect taxes. In the process, they sell oil.

8333 2018-11-28 13:46:32 Sadly, @MSNBC continues to air climate deniers—playing the false equivalency game when discussing the National Climate Assessment—instead of interviewing scientists. Why let Big Oil dictate programming? Stop playing out the propaganda goals of NPI. #EndClimateSilence
8334 2018-11-28 13:46:09 @RickSantorum is also in the pocket of big oil & coal.
8335 2018-11-28 13:46:01 Will Trudeau treat Alberta the same way he treats Mapleleafs Foods in Ontario ?
By my estimate he should be writing a cheque for
$ 188,000,000,000.00 for elimating the oil patch jobs.
8336 2018-11-28 13:45:54 fund also invests in other companies that are unethical and harming to the environment. There are huge discussions on drilling for new oil in the Barents sea, which has a high biological production compared to other oceans of similar latitude. Searching for new oil there would?

8338 2018-11-28 13:45:50 To discourage people from buying gas guzzlers, taxes need to go up as the price of oil goes down.

8347 2018-11-28 13:45:29 increased supply less demand. commodity price goes down. Alberta oil might still be undersold but I think it's wistful thinking that pay a shit ton of money to get this oil to another market it won't be undercut by other markets. Russia, Iran, Iraq and even Saudi oil wil esist.
8348 2018-11-28 13:45:25 Why does everyone think this is motor oil??

Market cap - £86m

Enterprise Value - £48m
Annual profit after tax (decom adjusted) - £68m
EV / Profit - 0.71

Half of production is gas, and half of oil production is hedged at >$68, so recent oil price drop has minimal impact.

No-brainer.

8456 2018-11-28 13:36:56 This is the guy who said we can't drill our way to lower gas prices (he was very wrong), and wanted us to decrease our dependence on oil / gas (some truth here). And now wants to claim credit for increased oil production.
8457 2018-11-28 13:36:53 A real snake oil salesmen
8458 2018-11-28 13:36:52 All of math is suspect.  Why is a "six" a "six" -- what if it identifies as "8"?  The whole thing is so damned essentialist and, dare I say it?, integerist!

8462 2018-11-28 13:36:40 This is not really an issue.  We don’t need Saudi oil or money.
8463 2018-11-28 13:36:22 The best line I've heard about this, is from @neontaster who said it's like taking credit for a touchdown when you are on the defense and failed to stop it. Seriously it's like USC taking credit for Notre dame perfect season because they lost

8468 2018-11-28 13:35:44 The cost of crude oil is now $50 barrel, a drop of 50%. Why is this huge price drop not being reflected in petrol & diesel prices at Irish filling stations???

8473 2018-11-28 13:35:29 Oil production is going up despite Obama’s administration, not because of it
8474 2018-11-28 13:35:29 I support 'carbon pricing' or a 'carbon tax', but I'd quibble on your definition. If the money is being added to the price of X by the gov't (whatever they do with it afterward), it's a VAT, not a company surcharge. But oil sands / tar sands, right?
8475 2018-11-28 13:35:28 easier to make it another way just wasting oil and money lol
8476 2018-11-28 13:35:28 thats not a 100% true the product you are selling must be real so if they were advertising the pancakes garnishing them with motor oil is well in the law the product you are selling must be real thats it

8480 2018-11-28 13:34:54 Wrong location. The oil reserves are in the gulf of Arabia off the coast of Pakistan. 

Proven reserves are there and temporary moveable Riggs did collect samples and measured the reserves already. 

This information is unofficial but given to me by a Pakistani engineer.
8481 2018-11-28 13:34:52 Olive oil is cold pressed ( the good ones), unless its organic canola is not.
Heating canola or too highly degrades the quality and can cause free radicals to form

Its become a total zero scenario in the equity pricing. Anything better than Mad Max will bounce things hard in the oil producers and the train guys have years of runway now.

8489 2018-11-28 13:34:00 Fools are those who rally behind someone who once believed a rock could vomit pure oil.

8500 2018-11-28 13:33:22 @odognine2 for your dull razor...soak blades in veggie or olive oil after each use.
8501 2018-11-28 13:33:18 Please. The dramatic increase in domestic oil production under Obama occured without tax cuts and decreased regulations. The very fact that oil boomed without them shows how little tax cuts and regs have to do with economic growth.

The only thing tax cuts impact are deficits.

He went quiet when it was pointed out they have Freedom of Workers and a hard border ( which according to customs officials,interviewed on R4 Today, on the border will never be frictionless. Besides they are dependent upon fish and oil.

8522 2018-11-28 13:31:49 Could you give reasons why?
8523 2018-11-28 13:31:43 Why do we need to get oil to foreign markets? There's no god-given right to the industry or occupation of your choice. Learn a trade.

Trump and friends know the science is valid. Denying it just buys them time to profit as much as possible -as quickly as possible.
8530 2018-11-28 13:31:00 Global #climatechange is a growing concern. #Solarpower reduces reliance on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas. When fossil fuels are used to create electricity, they produce harmful gas emissions. In contrast, solar energy produces no pollution. #Gogreen.

8578 2018-11-28 13:27:09 He is even more out to lunch in thinking oil will dominate for another 50 years. By 2029 EVs will dominate and the oil industry will shrink to 1/5 of its current size. Paradox is EVs will extend the life of oil as a resource for 200 years. It is either use it all in 50 or 200yrs.

8611 2018-11-28 13:24:53 Economic growth is faster due to the tax cut and the regulatory rollback -- pushed by Trump. This is a fact.

What specific policy action by Obama increased oil production?

8626 2018-11-28 13:23:18 Yes, we could do with another oil crisis for sure. Or reinstatement of the fuel tax escalator as a green tax to be reinvested in sustainable modes. Meanwhile, though obesity is still too high in NL, last information I saw showed it’s stopped increasing. The NL gov accelerated..
8627 2018-11-28 13:23:13 Disappointed in the stock market. If oil keeps up the slide many I know will lose jobs. Housing market is weakening. 21 homes for sale in one subdivision alone one after the next “reduced. “ This isn’t going well. My friend was laid off from GM in Arlington last year b4 Xmas btw!
8628 2018-11-28 13:23:10 It's pretty pathetic. Attempting to claim responsibility for current oil production levels is ludicrous. He's every bit as egotistical as Trump. He's just nicer about it.

8635 2018-11-28 13:22:56 Here's a thought - PM Trudeau should triple the price of Canadian oil and see how trump likes that.
8636 2018-11-28 13:22:55 So Trump gets the credit for the economic boom that preceded him but Obama doesn't get credit for oil production that happened during his administration.

Your bias is showing.
8637 2018-11-28 13:22:38 When are the MAGA’s going to realize that he isn’t the savior, just a racist snake oil salesman that will say anything to put him in power ?  Put down the Kool Aid and think for yourselves.
8638 2018-11-28 13:22:12 So, you are you also denying humans buy trillions of dollars of oil annually? 1.7 trillion in 2016.
8639 2018-11-28 13:21:59 the sooner we fry the planet
we’ll be rid of oil’s demands
8640 2018-11-28 13:21:59 This is killing our oil industry. Don’t forget the oil producers, along with the coal miners. We’re the only industry who isn’t government subsidized.

milk/water/buttermilk/oil adds up to 1 cup
1 egg (mix pending)

harder to write in metric, plus in practice a cup is all you need (any cup)

8672 2018-11-28 13:17:25 It takes about a decade to get gas production going (remember Democrats screaming this fact when Palin wanted to drill in ANWR?).

8731 2018-11-28 13:12:24 In few years time i hope to make millions of dollars from these oil companies who don't take the health and safety of their host communities has a priority.
8732 2018-11-28 13:12:20 Fantastically corrupt ,you know. Anyway, Nigerians woes is the engine oil for UK economy, govmt massacre of unarmed citizens, a necessary sacrifice for unmetered flow of crude oil.

8745 2018-11-28 13:11:23 I am short call 54 and 57 for this Friday..If we are around the current levels tomorrow I will start selling call 54 for Friday next week. Sentiment is so bad for oil that any upmove will be very slow.

8747 2018-11-28 13:11:12 I think he's confusing intelligence with motor oil again:

Your car is ready, sir.

Did you check the intelligence level on the dipshit?

Yes, sir. It's fine.

Is it high?

Yes sir. Very high.

I always tell people that, but they never believe me. But I'm like a smart guy.
8748 2018-11-28 13:11:12 Immigration being down doesn't really change anything, these people will just produce carbon dioxyde is another country but the effect on Earth will be the same.

Besides, the Trump administration fight for coal, oil..etc..is far more harmful for the environment than immigrants.
8749 2018-11-28 13:11:09 I switch my laptop on, only to turn it off again. Thought I'd be able to push through and burn the midnight oil tonight, ha ha can't take this mental exhaustion.
8750 2018-11-28 13:11:05 There’s grapes in the fridge and I’m tempted to lightly fry them in olive oil and freestyle a tangy vegan sandwich because I’m hungry enough to gamble and experiment with new weird recipes and eat the sandwich even if it tastes gross so it doesn’t go to waste.
8751 2018-11-28 13:10:57 How is the relationship with Saudi's vital? We receive more oil from Canada. Saudi's are essential to the continued flow of cash to Trump/Jared businesses,  vital to them. Killing our WP was blatant, brutal, endangers journalists around the world. Freedom of the Press is vital.
8752 2018-11-28 13:10:42 But the motor oil?
8753 2018-11-28 13:10:39 A local place does one with pear, Gorgonzola, and hazelnuts.  Olive oil instead of sauce and it’s delicious.
8754 2018-11-28 13:10:29 And there would be no oil left.
8755 2018-11-28 13:10:26 Moved South from the Midwest almost 4 yrs ago.

8757 2018-11-28 13:10:23 No, but I'd like you to stop cutting down rainforests for use of palm oil in your products!
8758 2018-11-28 13:10:21 Guess they shouldn’t have spent all of their money on the snake oil that fella from NYC was peddling, huh? Elections have consequences. They were warned about Trump yet voted for him anyway. Losing the family farm is the kind of harsh lesson these folks need. Zero sympathy.
8759 2018-11-28 13:10:19 Just to correct your Union junkie statement I actually voted SNP for 20+ years but didn’t particularly like the lack of any clarity in how they were going to take the Country forward! Oil , Gas , Hydro Electricity , Whisky and so on ...... remind me who owns all these lifesavers
8760 2018-11-28 13:10:18 I say a big reason why Black Seed Oil works is that it's also

8780 2018-11-28 13:08:46 You quote Trump: “Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay there.” Netanyahu doesn't want a Holy Land Trump Tower then?

8802 2018-11-28 13:05:51 Many voted for independence because we'd keep the the pound in a currencyunion and oil would be bringing in £8bn a year.

8872 2018-11-28 12:58:29 Why do we continue to use oil? It is and has always been a disgusting commodity.

8874 2018-11-28 12:57:56 What about that idiot Tony took us to war for oil that's a bit shitty killed thousands
8875 2018-11-28 12:57:55 To be fair, they had way too many eye-popping breakdowns in their own end but it didn't cost them. If that's the plan, they'rr going to need Koskinen bail them out quite a bit. Much like Talbot did throughout '16'-'17. Far too sloppy for a Hitch coached team.
8876 2018-11-28 12:57:51 Market futures remain up. Did I finally get it wrong? lol  Oil flat. NatGas same
8877 2018-11-28 12:57:42 Oh really? But if i can recall, even when the global oil price went down, or whatever commodity for that matters, people like Teresa were barking away and blaming BN anyway.
8878 2018-11-28 12:57:16 ahhhh what really?! 

omg okay i’ll look into coconut oil then, i also think tea tree oil is good bc i used it for a lil bit when i was younger

8884 2018-11-28 12:56:57 How is my question.
In oil and gas for example, they aren't asking for help. They don't see the benefits of digital information. The whole culture is still very old school.
Trudeau is already mistrusted in that industry, I would imagine a digital push would be ignored.
8885 2018-11-28 12:56:50 That commercial of the little duck getting oil washed off with @DawnDish soap just made me cry. Happy Wednesday. Be kind.

8888 2018-11-28 12:56:31 As a Cansdian, Trump can get his oil from the Saudis, since he thinks it will be cheaper, until he can show Canada and our Prime Minister the respect we deserve
8889 2018-11-28 12:56:29 Are you sure?Am not agreeing with this though. Nigeria has every reason to be great.Dipo may not literally mean Dubai has more oil or whatever resources they have.He is only trying to say that Nigeria got independence years ago and we are stalk in the same position. If not worst!

8896 2018-11-28 12:55:41 @bbc5live how the treasury can forecast 15 yrs ahead when they can't forecast the next 6 months beggars belief. Perhaps treasury can say what the $ oil is in 15yrs, which trade deals the UK will have & not forgetting why they think they will still in government
8897 2018-11-28 12:55:36 It goes well beyond that. You also need to refine oil to make it go into gasoline and to function as a car needs it to. So what’s the difference? There isn’t one!

I’ll let you know when my books out, maybe it’ll help you find some enlightenment.

Appreciate the discussion, thx
8898 2018-11-28 12:55:28 People been talkin bout motor oil on pancakes and now i finally understand
8899 2018-11-28 12:55:28 Latin America could be utterly devastated. As USA producers get more and more efficient (we're Americans, it's what we do), producers in ass backwards kleptocracies won't be able to keep up.  Most LatAm Nations now are very dependendent on oil exports for hard currency.....

8905 2018-11-28 12:54:47 It was the oil industry and frackers.
8906 2018-11-28 12:54:39 I just want to soak in oil until spring - winter is really killing my skin right now.

8908 2018-11-28 12:54:29 Yes that too. Diclofenac is an NSAID. Helps w pain. 

Massage with this and essential oil should cover it all. Whilst you're at it. Just get a head massage too w lavender oil. Helps relief stress :))
8909 2018-11-28 12:54:25 Actually the opening of oil fields in the dakotas and around Canadian border was done by Bush. Obama actually opposed fracking. So the truth is is that he's taking credit for a policy started by his predecessor that he opposed.

8996 2018-11-28 12:44:34 Oh yes, palm oil.
8997 2018-11-28 12:44:29 No thanks. Your chocolate recipe is a bit shit since Mondelez took over, and you use Palm Oil. Unethical, & never a sign of quality choccy

Lidl/Aldi make better chocolate, and half the price of your Polish-made American rubbish. And Continentals don't usually put Palm Oil in.
8998 2018-11-28 12:44:23 It smells like a setup by Moscow to scare feckless crude oil & gas traders to increase prices. Hope the meeting goes through and classic Trump negotiation will get another win.

9001 2018-11-28 12:43:57 Quick reminder so I can "told you so" to Trump next week.

One reason the oil prices are relatively low is concern over lack of US economic growth.

The solution (from an oil producers perspective)?  Reduce supply.

Which is exactly what OPEC will do when they meet on Dec the 6th
9002 2018-11-28 12:43:38 Could it be he was just talking out of his ass? Man, they bought that snake oil hook, line, and sinker.
9003 2018-11-28 12:43:32 Stockpiled med/vaccines for three months? Because your government will be able to make a deal in that time? You failed as the negotiator, keep selling that snake oil!

9010 2018-11-28 12:42:18 I eat at least a carton of eggs a week - it's a cheap and sustainable protein.  Also I like to roast veggies - a little olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper and you're good to go for pretty much any of them. Also I buy frozen meals when on sale to fill up my lab freezer

9019 2018-11-28 12:41:11 In engineering, when 2 surfaces are coming together (friction), the viscosity of an oil is the first & most important consideration when selecting an oil for a specific application. Viscosity must conform to the speed, load and temperature conditions of the lubricated parts...

It works really well for pain and takes the edge off anxiety although I kind of need a lot so I went through it quick. Oil is more long lasting. Make sure to get a pure brand too!

9043 2018-11-28 12:38:24 GM is losing money on cars when the demand is for trucks/SUVs, and the future is NOT in coal or oil, it's in electric, so they are restructuring to meet consumer demands. We saw this coming. But Trump promised they'd all keep their outdated jobs and is now threatening GM?
9044 2018-11-28 12:38:23 @jkenney @PremierScottMoe Love the idea.... Ontario can ship Canadian oil up the st Lawrence through the Quebec poop to reach Europe. We will have all of the right provincial governments to get it done shortly.
9045 2018-11-28 12:38:14 Presumably that poll was conducted in the mail canteen. 
Carefully worded questions can give misleading impressions.

No of course they wont- they are trying to sell Mays snake oil.

9046 2018-11-28 12:38:13 Sort of true but original tweet is mostly a hateful remark. We're more interested in why you prefer Saudi oil traveling over Atlantic, why the east buys Albertan oil from US, & why ppl refuse to look at the facts about pipelines? Btw Boom affects whole country.

9050 2018-11-28 12:37:46 Fire half of them, break the union, and then fire the rest who won’t go back to work. Then, hire Alberta oil and gas workers, and those from the auto industry. People who don’t take their livelihoods for granted. Voila.

9067 2018-11-28 12:36:14 Why did America media ignore #ParisRiots for a week?  Then why did #FakeNews report Parisians were rioting over high gas prices (against Big Oil). Riots 100% over fuel tax taking gallon of gas to over $7 thanks to #ParisAccord. Thank you Pres Trump for pulling us out.

9102 2018-11-28 12:31:14 And when will they do it? @conservatives prefer to use money giving tax cuts to rich rather than supporting the 14 million in poverty.

More or less correct - there was no attempt to explain how to get our massive structural deficit under control, despite a lot of Salmondesque chat about oil being a bonus not a basis.

9225 2018-11-28 12:15:51 AA predicts a massive fuel price cut of R1.85/liter next month. Awesome! For that you’ll have to thank the US’s Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia’s Muhammad bin Salman & Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The three have increased their oil outputs, dropping the price. OPEC is being sidelined.

What's important is making sure you apply some oil or cream to make sure your hair doesn't frizz and become hard.

9286 2018-11-28 12:07:10 Of course it is. Requires carbon (oil/gas/coal) back up to fill in the holes in RW. It is not working in Germany, the leading country in the world using it. Lifecycle for wind is ugly mining, high Carbon to build, and the blades are not recyclable. Solar waste is nasty- landfills

9354 2018-11-28 11:57:55 John Gapper: 'Peak oil' used to mean the fear that the natural resource would run out.  Now it means something even more concerning to oil companies — the prospect of demand peaking and reserves being left in the ground because they are not needed
9355 2018-11-28 11:57:53 there are powerful vested interests in india&abroad who are deliberately preventing india to extract petroleum from huge reserves present underneath indian soil in many indian states.thats because these nefarious forces want india to permanently import oil from islamist nations.

9427 2018-11-28 11:49:03 Not paying proper taxes, still using palm oil instead of cocoa butter, putting lots of people out of work in Bournville when you said their jobs were safe.

Speaking from experience here.
9430 2018-11-28 11:48:25 By late 2014 Nigeria was on well on the path of a recession. Look at GDP growth data: 

Q3 2014: 6.23%
Q4: 5.93%
Q1 2015: 3.96%
Q2 2015: 2.35%

With halving of oil prices in 2014, and absence of a savings buffer for the ‘rainy day’, the economy was doomed well before May 29, 2015

9433 2018-11-28 11:48:10 Why use palm oil at all? Not good for you anyway. No to products containing palm oil.
9434 2018-11-28 11:47:54 What a psychopath. What makes it even worse is that wars aren’t fought for these “noble values” you espouse. 

Next time there’s a war started by shitty politicians like you, on behalf of oil companies & arms manufacturers, hopefully, you’ll be shoved out on the frontline.

9458 2018-11-28 11:45:31 1. No. Scotland didn’t exploit those oil fields in there own. We did it as the UK. More than half of the oil is in English waters.i work in oil exploitation.  2. You keep saying half, but it isn’t half. It’s less. And that’s the issue isn’t it

9528 2018-11-28 11:36:04 Consumers can play a key role in driving a more sustainable palm oil industry. Boycotting palm oil may seem like an easy solution but it leads to replacing palm oil with more land-hungry crops. By increasing demand for certified sustainable palm oil (1/2)

9678 2018-11-28 11:14:37 In Scotland we have a bizarre juxtaposition where new oil field discoveries are celebrated by a government, the same government who called for subsidies to the oil industry when the prices crashed, yet the same government who want to ban diesel from city centres

9681 2018-11-28 11:13:48 Yep. The "we can use excess renewables" thing is entirely misleading. Given the poor efficiency of the H2 creation & use process, the amount of renewables needed would be 200x what we have now. Not going to happen, is it? So no wonder oil companies are keen to push SMR!

9698 2018-11-28 11:12:09 Many in Afghanistan don’t even have energy and are dependent on extremist groups for oil. They control the money. Setting up clean energy (and for the next few decades) selling the people US oil would alter the country in America’s favor. America chooses to be dumb.
9699 2018-11-28 11:12:05 Haaaahahaha you are the biggest snake oil salesmen ever.
9700 2018-11-28 11:12:02 No brainer.  Deal is done. China buys soybeans and oil.  Fed pause allows dollar to retreat allowing China to cut RRR.
9701 2018-11-28 11:11:49 This whole “we haven’t got enough time b4 Mar 29 to arrange everything for a no deal brexit” crap is just masking the utter incompetence of a Tory Govt that have done SFA on this in 2.5 yrs! The direction we voted for. Its all driven by/for oil tanker behaving corporates

9705 2018-11-28 11:10:54 But how can you know? What if oil goes up to $100 dollars a barrel - or $10? What if there is a war somewhere? What if the UK invents something the whole world wants and buys? Say something electric? What if tourism goes up 20%? What if Italy, Greece,Portugal leave eu? We thrive?

9710 2018-11-28 11:10:23 Scientists once said the world was flat, in 70s they said oil would run out in 30 years causing a fuel crises, in 2000 all computers would fail this just a few. Climate change has always been there and always will even after we have gone. BBC should stick to current news !!

9715 2018-11-28 11:09:37 A worry free life is a faith living life. You either trust God or you don't, but you cannot say that you are standing in faith while worrying at the same time. Just as oil and water cannot mix, faith and worry does not mix. Make your choice. 

Good morning.
9716 2018-11-28 11:09:22 The methodology is more accurate now than before. It turns out that previous versions by the Scot Gov were too optimistic. Especially on oil revenues. The SNP always egg up the bad side and promote the good side. Always.

9723 2018-11-28 11:07:22 2/2 I am not an economist (we had assistance from experts for our projects) but I believe that if we did the same calculations for a couple of recent years Scotland when oil prices were low it would show the notional Scottish deficit would be bigger than the UK one.

You wallow in other people’s misery to promote an ideology of climate change that is based on fraud

You are either a paid eco-terrorist in it for the money, or your are a deranged idealist hypocritically use in oil daily

Shameful
9731 2018-11-28 11:06:05 Why don't you worry about the thousands of Central American refugees who are shot at the US border? They need help, Venezuela needs that the US do not try to steal their oil and stop the blockade of medicines and food. Before you give your opinion, read about what really happens

9737 2018-11-28 11:05:13 I think what is left of the Uk would rather get oil, gas , electricity , water , foodstuffs and whisky from us rather than those pesky Russians . The small issue of not ha bing to put most of it on a boat will I think give us some competitive advantages supplying them .

9760 2018-11-28 11:02:54 I personally think that getting a certification in something is better than olive oil for this, it burns way too quickly.

9806 2018-11-28 10:57:07 there's a part of my brain that thinks the same way though. "if i just turn my back for five minutes i'll be deluged in messages, and that will prove people love me, and if i'm not, then they don't." not the most logical brain-part tbh. (but at least it's not olive oil.)
9807 2018-11-28 10:56:54 @richmholt Hi Richard, we're talking about how cannabis oil can be used to treat pain on BBC Radio Kent tomorrow morning. I read your article from last year on this subject and was wondering if you'd be willing to come on the show for a short phone chat tomorrow? Thanks, Emily
9808 2018-11-28 10:56:39 I like the use of the word “impaled” here. While technically correct, it appears they’re trying to evoke an image that ain’t quite accurate.

9817 2018-11-28 10:55:05 Conservatives wasted 9 years idolizing Harper, instead of telling him to get off his lazy ass and build a pipeline to the West Coast to ensure the long-term viability of Alberta oil resources. Imagine the economy Alberta would have today if Harper was not so incompetent.

9830 2018-11-28 10:52:51 Visited Dubai last week, my 4th visit. The country fascinates me totally as in spite of a monarchy the foresight of the rulers is phenomenal. With virtually no oil the rulers have displayed tremendous foresight to take the country where it is. The respect for law is outstanding.

For impulsive patterns, looking for higher timeframes to define the TRENDs is the way to get bigger pictures and make sound judgments.

9982 2018-11-28 10:30:19 Hi Martin, 
Our pricing decision is based on the wholesale price of gas and electricity (not crude oil) for Q1 of 2019. This is up by 25% from 1 Jan 2018. Whilst prices have dipped they have remained much higher for longer than we would've anticipated.
Annabel @ Pure Planet.
9983 2018-11-28 10:30:14 I should clarify, none was built that would move our oil away from the  American market that is currently raping our oil industry. The @CPC_HQ built or added to existing pipelines to that market, they did nothing to open new markets like the @liberals are currently trying to do.
9984 2018-11-28 10:30:13 The company car tax exemption is one of the most absurd tools of the Belgian taxman. It's a perverse and subtle subsidy to the car and oil industries. It's sickening us with toxic air and threatening our lives by wrecking the planet. Insane. Lower labour taxes instead, Mr taxman
