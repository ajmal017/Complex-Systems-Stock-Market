1 2018-06-25 23:59:00 Dow Jones Index dropped 328 points and tech stocks suffered their worst day in more than two months after reports that President Donald Trump plans to crack down on Chinese investment in major technologies in the US.

7 2018-06-25 23:51:56 I moved my 401k funds out of stocks and into mostly treasury notes, but this idiot is managing to put those under threat too, if China decides to sell off a bunch. I don't think they'll do that - they tend to not act rashly, but it's possible if Trump keeps escalating.

Get commission free trades!

Obviously, paper trade until you’re consistently profitable... but if you’re live trading & still learning, you need commission free trades. 

My broker charges $6.95/trade

I have 489 free trades left. What’s that worth?
53 2018-06-25 23:33:09 i keep getting voicemails in #mandarin i only trade #Chinese stocks i never ever plan to go there sorry fellows either speak english or all u get is boom boom bing bing as reply from me
54 2018-06-25 23:33:02 Yeah...I look at the minute to minute volume on penny stocks, as part of my overall analysis. I do alot of chart comparison too.  I was bang on with this one. Tomorrow is day 4 after 3 really good green days. Watch out for short squeeze. Might be good to short Wednesday.
55 2018-06-25 23:31:58 The #PUTUS trying 2 put a chain outa business? Make business too expensive 2 operate w/ his tariffs? Driving stocks down? Alienating allies that can help w/ China prob?

56 2018-06-25 23:31:56 Yes! And put them in the stocks while they are being grilled!
57 2018-06-25 23:30:58 There's a difference between strong stocks that are down a lot because their short-term trend got extended and stocks that are down a lot because they're in downtrends.

Think about your timeframe next time you see a stock that was ripping higher come off several percent in a day
58 2018-06-25 23:30:53 The LAT used a nice mix of NLP/ML to convert semi-structured recipes into a recipe database. ML/NLP also works well for any patterned stories: eg sports and stocks. I have a project in mind for repurposing older content.
59 2018-06-25 23:30:47 I have sold 100% of my U.S. stocks and 100% of my U.S. real estate.  I have no doubt that Trump will try to take everything down with him.
60 2018-06-25 23:30:32 i got bonds not stocks bitch that's how you save
61 2018-06-25 23:30:00 Are those stocks the same color blue as the dress?
62 2018-06-25 23:29:30 The Dow actually is down YTD but no one who knows anything about the markets follows that.  It’s an outdated price-weighted index of 30 stocks.
63 2018-06-25 23:29:09 Put them in stocks and pass the tomatoes and eggs
64 2018-06-25 23:28:29 And to think those who have not mastered buying stocks are thinking they will do well shorting them simply because they sucked at buying. Smh
65 2018-06-25 23:28:26 The selloff in Intl stocks is kinda nuts. No?
66 2018-06-25 23:27:47 I stopped buying stocks nearly a year ago and sold a significant percentage of my portfolio at multi- year highs. My only regret is that I didn’t sell more.

75 2018-06-25 23:17:51 Someone I know posts about stocks. I'm not interested, but the 1st comment: "Let's face it - most of these clowns don't know a thing about macro economics." Let's face it, this "person" has annoyed me since I was 17. This "person" has also defied odds every date he's ever gotten.
76 2018-06-25 23:17:06 The Dow is down 441 points today, and 9.3% since January 22nd, and it's only done that well because Trump gave corporations huge tax relief and they bought back their own stocks to keep them artificially high.
77 2018-06-25 23:15:30 My company pension plan changed the stocks over a year ago without me asking.
78 2018-06-25 23:14:53 I don't know about other people. But Inspite of the correction in mid & small caps funds, I am still struggling to find stocks/futual funds that offering some value.

80 2018-06-25 23:14:36 his words don't change no matter who in the room. That's why u guys hate him "Bump stocks" I don't like them not practical but yes protected
81 2018-06-25 23:14:08 Stocks can go down more than one thinks. You can try to catch a bounce but if it doesn't work right away, just stay aside.
82 2018-06-25 23:13:42 smart move.  we're too poor to hold stocks but if we did have them we'd a sold 'em too ... i might not be rich but i have more economic sense than drumpf et al ...
83 2018-06-25 23:13:06 Am I the only person about 99.978% certain that Trump and his are all raking in the $$$ from shorting the stocks of American companies that he is running off the tracks with his “international policies”??
84 2018-06-25 23:11:14 Just like @harleydavidson sharing in the "wonderful" #TaxScam. Buying back it's stocks & fleeing the country. Still winning...
85 2018-06-25 23:11:07 Besides, if you don't like my opinion, that's ok. Is still my opinion. Based on scientific data. The threats not necessarily have to be instant, normally the road to "hell" is progressive. Corals are dying, fish stocks that we eat in massive amounts are disappearing, etc.

90 2018-06-25 23:09:27 His base doesn't care.  They don't have market stocks.  They have gun stocks.  They were fed shit and they liked it.  A market crash would be Obama's fault to them.  Or the illegals or the Send who don't control anything.
91 2018-06-25 23:09:18 Yes, that is exactly what it means. 

We have no option left at this point to return some iota of truth and integrity without publicly shaming EVERYONE who supports lying and human rights violations. And since stocks aren't allowed any more, this is it.

Maybe learn to cook?
92 2018-06-25 23:08:28 Pierre Elliot Trudeau also some some serious problems to deal with. PM Mulroney did as well. Both actually did an amazing job ,given the world climate. Harper inherited a $13 billion surplus and blew it all.Then sold $3 billion in GM stocks to create a $1 billion fake surplus.
93 2018-06-25 23:07:27 It's a logic that knows no media coverage. The idea that wall street is in anyway an indicator of the American economy should tell us all who they mean. Don't know about you but i don't have enough expendable  money to put into stocks. So if the Dow is up, it means nothing to me.
94 2018-06-25 23:07:20 Must not need stocks to fund your retirement?
95 2018-06-25 23:05:48 Your trade wars are failing miserably. Look at the market today. I’m going to sell off stocks as you’re erratic, punitive trade moves are so dangerous as they lack strategy.
96 2018-06-25 23:05:32 Sure. I'll stick with stocks that represent companies with actual, tangible value
97 2018-06-25 23:05:21 Stocks tanked today on the news. Unsurprising, since this is what happens in trade wars.
98 2018-06-25 23:05:05 Stocks trying to catch up to crypto
99 2018-06-25 23:04:41 1/2 I think the point here was missed. Global warming was not being compared to the stock market, but the graphing and data analysis methods used for predicting global warming were compared with the charting used for stocks.
100 2018-06-25 23:04:08 #tytlive Humans, like stocks, have always been a "commodity" since the founding of the USA whether it be slave auctions, private prisons, nursing homes, etc. with shareholders playing the role of sharecropper as they benefit from these services often to the detriment of others...

104 2018-06-25 23:01:58 Don't you mean for their company stocks? With those tax breaks they reinvested and increased dividends not jobs. Do something real for middle America not the one percent.
105 2018-06-25 23:01:27 That not a bad move, maybe interest rate stocks and bonds,  cuz I think the interest rate going to go up

110 2018-06-25 22:58:58 So-called "technical analysis" as it stands in stocks/finance is only good for knowing what other technical analysis junkies are thinking. They're random heuristics that don't mean much more than that. Good for making daytraders feel smart and taking their money. #stocks $SPY

114 2018-06-25 22:56:27 Same! And anyone whose retirement is in stocks (think mutual funds) should switch over to the lowest risk option if you don’t have the choice of removing it all together

132 2018-06-25 22:48:29 Another One of the ‘Manpasand’ stocks of Motilal Oswal
133 2018-06-25 22:48:11 The stock market isn't a sign of "winning" .. America isn't winning if the stock market is up. Most people don't own stocks.
134 2018-06-25 22:47:34 Yes, finally, after hearing blah, blah, blah and nothing about guns when talking school safety, @KarlFDean speaks common sense when talking shoring up background checks, banning bump stocks and more.

135 2018-06-25 22:47:26 Thought we passed laws back in the 60s to prevent this kind of Racism. Or is this the new standard of Racism @TheJusticeDept
136 2018-06-25 22:46:20 In other, COMPLETELY UNRELATED news, Trump and his family of goons have reported billions in gains from shorting American stocks.
137 2018-06-25 22:45:49 I prefer M1 Finance. Nice mix of automation and being able to pick you own stocks plus it has no fees.
138 2018-06-25 22:45:49 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your insomnia
139 2018-06-25 22:45:32 They banned bump stocks in 1934?
140 2018-06-25 22:44:39 Invest in popcorn stocks and tissues from laughing so hard
141 2018-06-25 22:44:31 Stocks na enna
142 2018-06-25 22:44:13 Buying stocks in Canadian Cannibis (sp?) companies is a good bet.
143 2018-06-25 22:43:52 Was today’s drop really tariff mania? Some, but as Fusion warned, it was extended internals. Bulls rising again, high MA premias of SMIDs and growth stocks. Today mini Massacre was healthy but more is needed a la January that Fusion correctly predicted.
144 2018-06-25 22:43:31 At least all my weed stocks r UP!!
145 2018-06-25 22:43:23 COLONIAL CORPORATION stocks rallying
146 2018-06-25 22:42:42 Yes, bump stocks, machine guns, etc are all covered.
147 2018-06-25 22:41:31 Yeah lol I prefer #crypto stocks are for old people 
148 2018-06-25 22:41:14 It's partially due to the fame factor. I'm close to thirty years old and you're both younger and more famous than me, just some schlub who stocks groceries for a living. Possible some people feel the same way.
149 2018-06-25 22:40:58  AMC IS IS SELF-DESTRUCTION MODE CURRENTLY! 

COMING SOON to an $AMC theater near you: Spiders & Cobwebs 
150 2018-06-25 22:40:58 I sold all my stocks in Jan of 2017-too erratic and insane! #TrumpIsAMoron
151 2018-06-25 22:39:54 Trump is not stupid he is in fact very smart. This is a game of Chess and he is holding all the pieces. Anyone with half a Brain should see that. In the next month or so the stocks are going to skyrocket. And he will have the last laugh.
152 2018-06-25 22:38:21 While I understand that market players who use algorithms to earn a fraction of a penny in a fraction of a second love them some volatility, businesses who have factories, employees, inventory and stocks that already have steady growth built into price, not so much.
153 2018-06-25 22:37:44 I get all my gun stocks there
154 2018-06-25 22:37:43 Stocks can go way down but you don't lose unless you sell; it's the time to buy when they're low... only sell if you need the money for sure in the next 5 to seven years, otherwise hold...I've done this since 1986  and it's worked so far....
155 2018-06-25 22:37:42 Happy to hear you picked some up, it's only available while stocks last however we do have Dairy Fine Coconut Rough available as part of our everyday range, you should give it a try and let us know if it passes the taste test!
156 2018-06-25 22:37:07 The U.S-Chinese stocks are under profit taken such as $BABA , $HYUA , $YY , $BILI, $WB , $SINA , $MOMO , $NTES , $IQ , $JD and other about 90% stocks are sold off.
157 2018-06-25 22:36:27 Yeah, my stocks have never been higher. Not sure what you're speaking of? Unemployment down to 3.7 lowest since 2004. Facts. You should really read up policy's
158 2018-06-25 22:36:12 The world HATES Crooked Donnie. 

What about bump stocks??
159 2018-06-25 22:35:23 I'm not holding any stocks tied to the #DOW 
Playing it safe is to stay in cash which is exactly what so many are doing
My greatest fear is cyber war including portfolios stolen
Some are putting cash into hard assets
We MUST ALL be extra careful right now
160 2018-06-25 22:35:18 How are you planning for the long-term? Stocks purchased at depressed prices during the Trump term could substantially rebound under a more forward minded, progressive President, leading to a nice profit bump.
161 2018-06-25 22:34:45 Political concerns hit Italian bonds and stocks after the nationalist League party won municipal elections...
162 2018-06-25 22:34:41 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC was today’s selloff more about trade tensions or technicals? Tech stocks taking a breather before earnings season kicks off?
163 2018-06-25 22:34:40 As your stupid ill informed do anything #TrumpTradeWar goes into effect they are just going to be the first of so many. 

Stocks dropped 300 today after already being down more than 2,000 on the year. 

Estimates are you will cost anywhere from 2.6 -9 million jobs
164 2018-06-25 22:32:50 Did you move the $ into foreign stocks or US bonds or something else?
165 2018-06-25 22:31:39 Sickly yucky speach, you forgot inflating food and goods prices, taking more of our fish stocks than we can, importing god knows what amount of rapist,murders,con artists. So Caroline your speach is so one sided it belongs to a crazy political party like the Greens
166 2018-06-25 22:30:58 My parents who have money and are fiscally intelligent... not in US stocks!
167 2018-06-25 22:29:43 If Trump took his inheritance and just gave his money to a good stock broker, had a well diversified portfolio and made the average, mundane gains the stock market made since then with little to no risk stocks, futures etc. he’d be worth $9-10B, instead he’s not even worth 1/3rd
168 2018-06-25 22:29:27 MaxVal-u specials available in our stores starting today until Wednesday 27/06/18 or while stocks last!!

170 2018-06-25 22:28:15 Seeing stocks with great news and PT upgrades today and they still get totally slammed.Something has changed for sure....
171 2018-06-25 22:27:30 Thanks Ed. What little stocks I have, selling now.
172 2018-06-25 22:26:33 6 breakouts: $GTN (gap and 200-day MA), $LGCYO (gap), $ZFGN. Few stocks but also no penny stocks in the scan which is a positive.
173 2018-06-25 22:26:09 I put the majority of my retirement in safe, non stocks, investments in November 2016.
174 2018-06-25 22:25:11 Problem here, is you cant get borrow (Well I cant) for any /most of the cobalt stocks.
175 2018-06-25 22:24:55 People: “how do you eat such spicy food?”
Me: “I own stocks of the transit line operating the bus I’m riding to hell so I may as well acclimate myself to the cuisine of the underworld while I have time left on earth”
176 2018-06-25 22:24:45 Yea that nice pull back Time to stock up on some stocks hehe
177 2018-06-25 22:24:35 If I sell all my stocks won’t I pay a lot in capital gains?
178 2018-06-25 22:23:54 Damn I am so glad that you have studied the markets for years and years, selling stocks and bonds and achieving a triple A rating pronouncing that the market is selling because of POTUS. ID10T
179 2018-06-25 22:23:46 Thank god. I've been so worried about you all down there. Edinburgh stocks are shaky and if there's no squeaky cheese come tomorrow night ... then the New Town will turn ugly.
180 2018-06-25 22:22:57 i feel like this was @ me
181 2018-06-25 22:20:22 Check these #stocks that hit all-time highs: $NCOM, $NGHCP
182 2018-06-25 22:19:48 Too bad we don't have stocks, like in puritan times. Chasing them out of public spaces is the best we can do. They deserve no rest or peace for what they are doing to this country.
183 2018-06-25 22:19:40 So all the Dems are quiting or are they just buying more Chinese stocks and shipping jobs over
184 2018-06-25 22:18:48 Bulls walk up stairs, bears jump out windows. #stocks #bonds
185 2018-06-25 22:18:46 These idiots don’t know what’s coming. So glad I dumped my amazon stocks in 2001 
186 2018-06-25 22:18:12 Tune in: #DaybreakAustralia on @BloombergTV with @Kathleen_Hays and @HaidiLun I’ll be bringing you the First Word news #globalnews #newsupdate #markets #stocks #tvnews 
187 2018-06-25 22:17:55 Her Leave-voting constituents need to educate their traitorous MP, (preferably using public stocks)
188 2018-06-25 22:17:16 @jimcramer why don't stocks split anymore?  I just mean a company like Amazon it's hard to buy 100 shares because the price is so high.  Why would they not split the stock so more people can buy shares.
189 2018-06-25 22:17:11 I got money in the bank stocks are up, I’m not screwing my self I took a big loss during Obama’s time
190 2018-06-25 22:17:08 double ganon
I've taken more stocks with double ganon with a trash friend than with good teams with a decent friend, just flail about and you'll do something
191 2018-06-25 22:17:06 Most companies brought back their own stocks!
192 2018-06-25 22:16:22 Predictions  usually come back to haunt you! Instead, I own many #uranium #stocks, preferably with high-grade world-class #U3O8 assets, strong cash positions (avoid dilution!), takeout potential, discovery & US 232 exposure. $FCU $DML $NXE $SYH $UEX $GXU $EFR $URE & more.
193 2018-06-25 22:14:56 Yes, Farm States be patient.

Stocks are already dropping because of what Trump starting trade war is going to do to you.

If they continue to believe him - it will be okay - they aren't the only ones in this country who will be hurting.
194 2018-06-25 22:14:07 I place low bids on stocks, so if it dips I can grab some cheap. I agree with @smallcapsteve $ian will do very well. I have a postion. Looking to add.
195 2018-06-25 22:12:18 Now everyone dying to jump into the marijuana business and whether it be stocks or dispensaries head shops selling misc items and soon weed infused food
196 2018-06-25 22:12:14 What would you say is the most profitable stock or etf to play on down days? Individual stocks seems to pay way more than ETFs. $SPY $QQQ $GOOGL
197 2018-06-25 22:12:09 Don’t save. They don’t live within their means.  I know a 14 year old buying and selling stocks.  If people could save $50 a week they would be a cash millionaire at 65. If a 15 year old can save $2,000 a year for 7 years and never save another dime they’d have $1M @ retirement
198 2018-06-25 22:11:34 Trouble in paradise, or manipulation to load up on cheap stocks? I don’t know, but what I do know is — be cautious, do your research, and prepare for any outcome.
199 2018-06-25 22:10:32 Starting a trade war isn’t the solution.  Stocks tanking
200 2018-06-25 22:10:21  Have a look these #stocks that marked record highs: $AMSWA
201 2018-06-25 22:10:12 The fundamental difference between crypto and stocks is a tangible reason for primary growth. Secondary growth is spec. And then there is the pump.
Some chug for ages some become a producer. Buying at support levels or on another t/a confirmation is vital in specs. Andrews on it.
202 2018-06-25 22:09:51 I agree - the bond yield curve is about to invert, a powerful signal of a coming recession. Expect the talking heads in the media to start pushing the dupes to buy stocks, while quietly dumping their own.
203 2018-06-25 22:09:48 Because he broke the stable state the world WAS in. Life does not begin and end within your own borders. Take a look at the WORLD stocks. If you don’t get it good luck with that. I’m done. Peace out

206 2018-06-25 22:06:49 For vcl characteristics and write stocks down on a watchlist. Finally, I look to see if they meet the trend template and I classify the category and whether it fits the expectations. I then analyze the margins, sales, eps to make sure they are good and buy above pivot.
207 2018-06-25 22:06:17 Lol... medicinal pot is going to boom this year especially in Canada... gold, silver is tanking I’ll wait till it hits rock bottom but keeping hold of my pot stocks!

214 2018-06-25 22:02:03 We do need to do more to educate people though on how the prison for profit pipeline is providing the fuel for this racist evil. The 2 private prison companies incarcerating these children each gave $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration and private prison stocks have risen 100%.
215 2018-06-25 22:00:44 Today, stocks cra…. Give us them emails!

221 2018-06-25 21:57:07 No one accurately predicts BEAR markets EVER! In the 1970's the market dropped 48% over 19 months, in the 1930's dropped 86% over 39 months. A Bear market occurred in U.S. as #stocks dropped 57% over 17 months. In Japan from 1998 to present declined 80% #stocks #Robinhood

226 2018-06-25 21:54:49 Unfortunately it won't be until we all agree on a name convention to refer to ASX stocks in twitter that we can get a quality measure of mentions. Look at BTC Health today at top of the chart. Click on the tweets and all of them referring to Bitcoin.
227 2018-06-25 21:54:34 Well done trump finally a win you lost more than Obama ever did.
Escalating trade dispute between the United States and other leading economies battered U.S. stocks on Monday, handing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq their steepest losses in more than two months.
228 2018-06-25 21:54:16 Time to run back to stocks!
229 2018-06-25 21:53:46 I picked up $SPY calls for a lotto just in case we gap up tomorrow off of support. All 3 major indices /YM, /NQ, and /ES bounced off major support into the close. $PCALL above 1.00 #stocks #options #trading #BTFD
230 2018-06-25 21:53:45 Tomorrow is decisive....Maybe we are some notches up and then the everything bubble continues..... (I have changed some stocks in Europe today: some battered chip producers in and defensive stocks out (in US I sold GIS)...the market is in turmoil...
231 2018-06-25 21:53:42 I’m taking 1000 positions on every play I make do you think that’s a good size for these low volume stocks?
232 2018-06-25 21:53:29 Actually Sarah, it DOES!
233 2018-06-25 21:53:17 Right now, it’s Bitcoin. But in the past we’ve had dotcom stocks, the 1929 crash, 19th-century railways and the South Sea Bubble of 1720. All these were compared by  contemporaries to “tulip mania,” the Dutch financial craze tulip  bulbs in the 1630s. Bitcoin, is tulip mania 2.0.

238 2018-06-25 21:49:01 All about that Sheetz life. Even though Wawa stocks ooey gooeys.
239 2018-06-25 21:48:03 You mentioned last week these china stocks would take a dive and I took note bc I rode these puppies all the way up 
Nice call rock
240 2018-06-25 21:47:53 Going to have to explain the trade negotiations to the public. Stocks have lost their 2018 gains. In the short term, prices may go up. I understand that we will win over time, but a lot of Americans have short attention span
241 2018-06-25 21:46:43 Harley Davidson; stocks have been going down prior to the tariff changes. Harley Davidson Needs to stay strong....and needs to stay in the United States!!!

There’s no end to this conversation 
Look @ your tec stocks today on the market 
Harley Davidson announced today it will have to build overseas if the tariffs go ahead 
Good luck 
Goodbye 
248 2018-06-25 21:44:00 The value went up in the stocks
249 2018-06-25 21:43:41 CBOT July wht down A$6.30 as ongoing trade tensions with the US & China triggered more selling in all grains. Worst of US drought over & harvest results better than expected. Selling ahead of USDA stocks report on Friday. Rains in some global trouble spots incl Aust.
250 2018-06-25 21:42:48 Damn this trade war goofing my stocks
251 2018-06-25 21:42:41 47% of Americans own stock. 10% of Americans own 80% of all stocks. Explain to me how the stock market is an indicator for the success of the average American.
252 2018-06-25 21:42:10 As usual you start fights with superficial knowledge of subject matter(trade) and then are shocked when things start to go wrong. The trade war you have started has not even begun and soy prices are tanking, stocks falling and companies scrambling to save themselves. Feel stupid?
253 2018-06-25 21:40:48 CBOT July wht down A$6.30 as ongoing trade tensions with the US & China triggered more selling in all grains. Worst of US drought over & harvest results better than expected. Selling ahead of USDA stocks report on Friday. Rains in some global trouble spots incl Aust.
254 2018-06-25 21:40:40 You Ms. Pelosi and your fellow Congresswoman, Maxine Waters, have made laughing stocks of yourselves and helped the red political side stronger by your total lack of character, work ethic for the people of this country, and shown us what a lack of character looks like!
255 2018-06-25 21:40:29 That's why the tariffs are tanking stocks.
256 2018-06-25 21:39:07 Wow was checking on my stocks today (ouch) and realized GOP still trying to take my healthcare away and now want to penalize for preexisting conditions. Let’s take Congress benefits away and see how they like it
257 2018-06-25 21:38:24 Lying on disclosure forms and shorting stocks prior to a news drop with insider knowledge. 

*pointing* 

Arrest this man!

*Looks around sees no one*
258 2018-06-25 21:37:45 how would someone know why everyone is buying and selling stocks?
259 2018-06-25 21:37:44 It is still in stocks at other places but you did already paid for your so you should get it. Ah, no sweat. Really felt for you when I saw that. I do hope it works out.
260 2018-06-25 21:36:18 ....because bump stocks are used so frequently. Oh wait, no actually.
261 2018-06-25 21:36:13 @FTC @Nasdaq @SEC_News @SPGlobal @SEC_Enforcement @DowJones If @realDonaldTrump makes tariffs & policies that cause stock prices 2 go down, buys stocks at low price, then changes the tariffs & policies 2 send the stocks higher, can he be charged with insider trading?
262 2018-06-25 21:35:41 Idea: a mutual fund that buys stocks in companies in the half hour after they are attacked by Trump on Twitter.

271 2018-06-25 21:33:30 Your stupid vanity tariffs brought the stocks tumbling today. This is an ill-fated folly. Go talk to the Missouri nail manufacturer.

278 2018-06-25 21:29:24 @Rob5555 @pnvoss why would I sell one of the strongest stocks in the entire market today? Barely down on low volume . Only a fool would sell
279 2018-06-25 21:29:00 Sanctioned Russians and short sale of stocks--nothing to see here, move along.
280 2018-06-25 21:28:57 Stocks suffer worst day in weeks...@realDonaldTrump will crash the economy!
281 2018-06-25 21:27:58 It's now coming apart at it seams. America now sees the true Mofia management by Trump and the stocks are tanking and business likey Harley Davidson are pulling out of the USA.
282 2018-06-25 21:27:03 Maybe Trump is trying to distract us from the regulation that is being reviewed about banning bump stocks.  Trump promised high school kids that he could pass a law banning bump stocks easily and he never did. Now our government is reviewing this without Trump's involvement.
283 2018-06-25 21:27:02 Need to start looking into stocks

285 2018-06-25 21:26:39 It's so funny listening to the media types... 2-3 days of getting hit across the head by 2X4's and they wake up to the dangers of these extremely over valued stocks.  LMAO.  They will hate them when I'm buying them again
286 2018-06-25 21:26:27 Parfois elles viennent de paquets neufs, contaminés dans les magasins et les stocks :-/

Oil&Gas Field service stocks are extremely cheap right now. Like investors don't even know they exists...

293 2018-06-25 21:22:59 All stocks -> 1 stock: full passive -> full active. Where’s the line? One particular index? Like just buying the S&P?

296 2018-06-25 21:21:37 I think that's it. I think this tech wreck could kick in, then I might get bsnk into some FAANG and semis. I'd like to get back into some oil stocks.  Sold most of that that I had since late 15 early 16. May have missed that opportunity last week.
297 2018-06-25 21:20:16 Today di33 our stocks fall drastically 
298 2018-06-25 21:19:48 People I chat with that I trust (insiders who have worked with the big 4), really like Vic and have great things to say about him.  Saw Cam present $ACB last week, confirmed what most bay street types say about them. I hardly hold any Canadian weed stocks, (a little $VFF).
299 2018-06-25 21:19:39 Pretty sure they're ready for it. That's why stocks are dropping. They're pulling their money out already.

305 2018-06-25 21:18:06 The US economy has been toast for a long time. The only thing keeping the stock market up is the central banks printing trillions of dollars and companies buying back their stocks. Individual deals between countries best. Fair trade deals.

307 2018-06-25 21:17:04 U.S. stocks skidded Monday as investors grew concerned that technology companies are being pulled into the broadening trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Indexes in Europe and Asia also fell.
308 2018-06-25 21:16:18 #WR Analysis: China-US trade war hits again the tech stocks @WSJ “U.S. stocks tumbled Monday, heading for their biggest one-day slide in months, as fresh escalations in the global trade conflict sent investors fleeing from some of the market’s best-performing technology firms.”

314 2018-06-25 21:14:06 I just want to thank all of you people selling off your stocks so cheaply.

I'm buying and will laugh my butt off when you guys suddenly realize what Trump is setting up. I'm gonna make another bundle just like I did on the Brexit crash.

316 2018-06-25 21:13:01 The stocks are sinking, jobs are fleeing, and nothing is getting done under GOP leadership.
317 2018-06-25 21:12:56 The market was brutal today, but I think this pullback will also be a great longer-term opportunity (just like the February and May pullbacks). There's nothing that has changed fundamentally and in fact, macro charts show high probability of continued bullish trend. #Stocks

328 2018-06-25 21:07:02 I remember reading, days after the election, that folks were rushing to buy stocks in private prison corporations. It stayed with me. Now I see that Trump planned on enriching those folks before he was elected. I’m sure it is helping Mercer’s, aka Eric Prince & other $$$ doners.
329 2018-06-25 21:06:21 No doubt don’t go to sleep. I like some consumer names out there. Scanning US based only stocks. SNV CBRL etc. or like gwph  I went back into today. MLM VMC.

337 2018-06-25 21:02:56 Sure Anh. Buying on breakouts or pullbacks depends on your own strategy, personality, your own research on your own types of stocks, position size, time frame...
Do some testing and find what suits you best.

You're talking about a group of 30 Blue-Chip Stocks, not the market as a whole.

It's painfully obvious you don't know what you're talking about. Keep trying, though.
356 2018-06-25 20:59:03 Not exactly, when you buy stocks, they will keep a certain value as long as the company survives. Why should bitcoin keep their value? And what do you get when you "buy" bitcoin? You have no ownership rights over anything, just hope and promises it will all be OK, yeah, right

380 2018-06-25 20:49:02 Never say never. By early 2020 it could be retesting $19,000. Between now and then it can take out $3600. That is a separate discussion and analysis. The days of retiring off of as little as $5k or $10,000 are over though. These gains are more similar to powerful stocks.
381 2018-06-25 20:49:00 Indeed we do have less 2nd Amendment rights under Trump yet his supporters have no clue because facts like Trump signing an UnConstitutional EO to ban bump stocks & other accessories wasn't reported on FOX, Breitbart or talk radio. Their ignorance is destroying us.

384 2018-06-25 20:47:35 This sounds like something @realDonaldTrump would say. "The markets decided to plunge after the new tarrifs were put in place. Fake news CNN is responsible. Stocks should only be able to go up, not down. Sad!"

386 2018-06-25 20:47:29 U.S. semiconductor stocks slumped on Monday, including deep losses in Intel, Micron Technology and Nvidia, as new measures targeting the technology sector in President Donald Trump's trade conflict with China triggered a wave of investor fear.

393 2018-06-25 20:44:27 i shouldn't have said 'long term', i meant until the fall, like greg is predicting. i guess long and short timeframes shrank for me, lol. in short (no pun intended), until the fall, the stocks will stay up or go higher. lots of 52week highs lately.

395 2018-06-25 20:44:19 U.S. semiconductor stocks slumped on Monday, including deep losses in Intel, Micron Technology and Nvidia, as new measures targeting the technology sector in President Donald Trump's trade conflict with China triggered a wave of investor fear.

402 2018-06-25 20:43:29 World stocks remain overwhelmingly bearish.  Not to mention other countries are much cheaper than US wheat.   It's probably oversold at these levels but I think wheat market is the most bearish of the 3.
403 2018-06-25 20:43:10 The top five stocks that moved higher today were $CPB, $SCG, $FE, $XEL, and $KMB.

417 2018-06-25 20:32:24 @FoxNews @TeamCavuto @FoxBusiness TV screen says "stocks dive"and I really question that it's an over exaggeration when we're only down 1.33%  Losing 300 points isn't what it used to be now that we're over 24,000.
418 2018-06-25 20:31:11 @NicolleDWallace Nicolle, this morning there was the story about Wilber Ross & his failure to divest himself of stocks he said he had is very troubling
419 2018-06-25 20:30:55 I think the big thing you miss on stocks every day is that not everyone is obsessed about the macro (in part b/c nobody can get it right with any consistency - everyone is guessing). Many equity investors (the best IMO) are bottom up, focussing on company specifics primarily
420 2018-06-25 20:30:47 @Varneyco You are a massive idiot. The tax cuts are not helping everyday ppl

426 2018-06-25 20:29:00 There's always panic in Tariff "wars". Harley 6% tariff to Europe, is now 31%. Sales are down in the U.S, but growing in Europe. So, HD is planning on moving manufacturing to Brazil, Philippines, ect. to avoid additional tariffs. Stocks take a hit. Wait and see what happens.
427 2018-06-25 20:28:35 Stocks are all speculative and negative media just drives it down further.

429 2018-06-25 20:26:30 Honestly i wouldnt buy stocks right now, id put some money in an ETF for the semi low volatility. If you needed to buy a stock thought id just find something from a sector that historically has an inverse correlation with tech (idk what, maybe energy, look it up).

438 2018-06-25 20:23:14 That’s clever - everyone thinks crypto, but today you can barely do anything with crypto in your Robinhood account. What you (and the millions of others who signed up) CAN do is buy stocks. Their bet is that you will, when you’re ready. Come for the crypto, stay for the stocks.

440 2018-06-25 20:21:06 There's a beautiful vase of stocks on my mantelpiece - stunning colours - so I'm ashamed to admit I bought them, rather than plucking them from my non-existent cutting garden.  #gardenshour
441 2018-06-25 20:20:26 World stocks in mini-crash: Europe -2%; US -1.4%. Stocks continue volatile year, already with more 1% or more down days than last year. Expect more as trade war fears move from probable to likely. World economy won't escape unscathed. No recession likely but profit slowdown is.

445 2018-06-25 20:19:35 @TeamCavuto you blame trade but if you look at the broad range of stocks that closed lower, this drop is based on Wall Street way of making money. Trade War just an excuse!

472 2018-06-25 20:09:11 Yall didnt wanna believe that Tech stocks were in a bubble but as soon as tensions rise with trade all the short term investors sold off their tech securities to hold on to their gains and NOW the market is in a damn spiral. THIS IS WHY SHORT TERM INVESTING RUINS THE MARKET.
473 2018-06-25 20:08:20 But that's a secondary effect. Stocks are down today because people are selling them. People are selling them because they have trade war fears :).

500 2018-06-25 19:57:09 I'm not a follower of the stock market.  However is it possible the whole trade war is a plan to lower the market, Trump and pals buy a bunch of stocks and bonds, end the trade war, values go back up and they make millions?

520 2018-06-25 19:47:16 Percent of Stocks Above 200-Day Average INDEX: 57.20
521 2018-06-25 19:47:11 $WSR and $SNH are both good REITS. Based in US. Good fundamentals. Technicals, still cheap because REITS got hammered while tech stocks soared in Jan / feb .
522 2018-06-25 19:46:38 All the stocks have crumbled. Allllll
523 2018-06-25 19:46:37 Have to really just find a few stocks to look at, I have to many on my screen its overwhelming. Even with making a plan still looked at other stuff and when my plan did happen I didn't take it. So really just gonna focus on 3 maybe 4. If I miss some other stuff oh well
524 2018-06-25 19:46:33 $PSTI if you are looking for day trading stocks, you should check out $AXON, $VLRX, $XBIO, $YECO, $ABIL, $GEVO, $ZFGN

Take your profits and go away you will find better opportunities down the line
529 2018-06-25 19:45:28 I like a good investment as well as the next individual, and prison stocks are as close to a sure thing as I've seen. That said, I will never put a red cent on prison stocks because I like being able to face myself in the mirror.
530 2018-06-25 19:45:19 Ultimately bullish = buying up stocks after everything crashes
531 2018-06-25 19:44:20 @ShepNewsTeam Shepard Smith, why are you so happy when the stocks go down and about the tariffs effecting us in a negative way.  I guess what I’m asking is why are you happy when USA fails in an area?
532 2018-06-25 19:44:17 *Retweet* All these over-extended stocks from June 18th took a hit in this sell-off

541 2018-06-25 19:41:50 Due to market and sector volatility I have given my POT stocks wider than usual stops! This is one of the benefits of making timely entry.

544 2018-06-25 19:40:05 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
545 2018-06-25 19:39:45 A bloody red trading day is about  to be in the books. No much action taken - just sit tight and watch what is going on - encouraged by the relative performance of POT stocks - which is currently my biggest holdings. As a trader however I am watching like a hawk to my stops!
546 2018-06-25 19:39:37 Seeing many names testing support, some broke and some held. Tomorrow's action will be quite telling if dip buyers retake control of certain stocks that have held up today. That's where a lot of my focus will be on Tuesday.

548 2018-06-25 19:38:36 Question for fintwitfluencers: what is the best tool for charting different stocks and indexes and baskets against each other? #fintwit #content
549 2018-06-25 19:38:32 Stocks paring losses as Navarro speaks on @CNBC, wait just ticked down again as he mentioned the "deep state." Okay now paring again.
550 2018-06-25 19:38:19 you dont make money by renting out your time. you make money by having someone work for you while you sleep. also w/ 2% inflation you need a 2% raise every year to break even. Or you can own assets that appreciate at least 2% a year ie own property/stocks/billboards/wingstops
551 2018-06-25 19:38:14 The #Fed's priorities imho... 
1. Bond yields - keeping them down
2. Stock prices - pushing them higher (Federal Tax Receipts, US solvency)
3. The Dollar
Once the Fed's tighter monetary policies cause stocks to dump, which do you think they'll sacrifice? h/t @LukeGromen
552 2018-06-25 19:37:26 Navarro on CNBC: Despite study under way, no present plans to impose investment restrictions on any country - vs Mnuchin's 'all countries.' Navarro says stocks drop a 'misunderstanding.' @economy @federalreserve @trade @anthonymace10
553 2018-06-25 19:37:14 The 3 best securities to hold in today's down day:
- Cash

557 2018-06-25 19:35:50 $NVRO and $DXCM - two good DOMESTIC growth stocks down 5%.  Sometimes you are walking down a street and you see a $20 bill on the ground... Would you pick it up? 
558 2018-06-25 19:35:47 Why do I save wealth in #Bitcoin? Bec no other asset is a superior mechanism in sending value through time. Fiat is a guaranteed loss through inflation, bonds are in the biggest bubble in history, individual stocks are prone to tech disruption & gold supply is completely unknown.
559 2018-06-25 19:35:37 A lot of stocks I've been short have been down 2-3 days or more and are stretched to the downside - the "piggy principle" also applies to the short side!
560 2018-06-25 19:35:02 I still have a lot of powder dry. But during this sell off today, I did add to my SP500 index fund (IVV) and my international stock fund (VXUS). As well as bought into cyber security etf HACK. Slow steps. This is a news driven market so anything can happen. #Stocks #Invest
561 2018-06-25 19:34:32 I've seen stocks play with that number for weeks, makes ya think about the big guy huh.. .

Anyways, this thing passes through soon
562 2018-06-25 19:34:20 Narvaro:  "Buy stocks"....
563 2018-06-25 19:33:49 I have ordinary stocks planted, and they smell beautifully spicy, but no evening scented stocks,
564 2018-06-25 19:33:30 Except all these corporations are just buying back stocks. And the poor and middle class may have received a little extra money right now, but that was a smoke show. They will get screwed come tax time next year.
565 2018-06-25 19:33:24 Everybody wants out of US$, #Gold and stocks today. Is the € the safe haven du jour again?

571 2018-06-25 19:31:36 Periodic corrections in the US Markets are good. They give investors a chance to sell stocks they feel are weak and reinvest in stocks they think are better investments. Only the weak panic when corrections occur.
572 2018-06-25 19:31:24 Dow and tech stocks down big at close due to tariffs and interest rate hikes.

576 2018-06-25 19:28:26 Yeah during the 90s they banked big bucks, and CEO'S wanted higher % into their stocks it was a bound to burn down either way for the American people and moved over seas.
577 2018-06-25 19:28:14 As long as u're watching the right stocks; hardest parts of day trading are 1) WAITING for your set-ups and 2) EXECUTION i.e. getting in close to your planned entry price and then stopping out at your planned stop if the set-up fails or book profits at your planned targets
578 2018-06-25 19:28:00 I’m so tempted to buy this dip, so many stocks on sale like $NFLX but I will wait patiently
579 2018-06-25 19:27:40 One GOOD thing about the Donald-Kim meeting was the war merchant stocks took a nose dive on wall st.
580 2018-06-25 19:25:51 they be like "hi TK idk if you remember me but im the guy that beat you 2-1 at SKTAR in winners round 3 i was the green MK and i had 2 stocks left with 3 minutes remaining on smashville"
581 2018-06-25 19:24:23 Very interesting and moving - would love to visit some time. But not if you put me in the stocks!
582 2018-06-25 19:24:05 The U.S. stocks are starting to tank as well because of this trade war. Larry Kudlow never like tariffs but decided to put aside his own knowledge and join the trump team.  Why do people disregard their own beliefs for this clown?

585 2018-06-25 19:23:00 completely agree. the FANGS and the momo stocks had gone parabolic like they did in January. So the mkt did what it did in February.
586 2018-06-25 19:22:37 You can care about overall stocks and local flows.
587 2018-06-25 19:22:30 Prediction, @realDonaldTrump @POTUS will tweet he's best friend's again with China's Xi and #Stocks will rebound. Make sure you're ready for the rebound, #HODL or add to your position on this markdown crazy Eddie's sales extravaganza day.

Gold in EUR is literally the only thing I'm not underwater with (longer term).
590 2018-06-25 19:21:43 I don't understand the way the stock markets work. Can someone explain how to me how "shorting" stocks work. Maybe Mr Trump?
591 2018-06-25 19:21:24 Dang my dude put that skill into stocks 
592 2018-06-25 19:20:33 So if you ask @cgberube, you'll find a naval historian who has a real expertise in associated questions. The viability of fishing stocks and enforcement of associtated regulation has long been a naval (& revenue service/coast guard) subject. Look at SCS, they're directly related.

601 2018-06-25 19:16:46 2018. USA. Children as hostages. Asylum seekers turned away and not given due process. Politicians complicit. Secrecy and communication deficits. Private prisons stocks up 100%. How did we get here? #5thAmendment #14thAmendment #Vote2018
602 2018-06-25 19:16:25 Stocks tanked big time today on trade war fears & news that Harley Davidson will be moving some production to Europe.

Trump and the GOP could fuck up a one car funeral.

604 2018-06-25 19:15:23 DJ-30 gives a "sell" signal as investors pile into Utility stocks

No sell confirmation yet from any of the other major indices.
605 2018-06-25 19:14:50 And thus you have caused a stock market crash! Stocks still going down! Harley taking jobs outside US! Losing all your supporters and your votes! Please stop NOW! Reverse tarrifs! You and your family will lose money in a crash! We can’t recover 500 points!
606 2018-06-25 19:14:50 if stocks are trading at prices I planned buying at, and still above support areas I wanted to see hold, I put some risk on. With VIX as high as it is, I buy smaller positions than I usually would.
607 2018-06-25 19:14:46 When Trump told #MAGA voters to buy stocks, the smart money started selling.

DJIA close:

Jan 30: 26,439 

June 20 now: 24,157

If you took Trump's advice to buy stocks during his 2018 #SOTU address, you are now down 9%, even as gas prices and healthcare costs continue to soar.
608 2018-06-25 19:13:57 Turned into penny stocks?

609 2018-06-25 19:13:49 HW liked to tell a tale of how Kennedy talked up his economic policies by saying 'If I wasn't president I'd be buying stocks right now' to which a reporter supposedly replied 'If you weren't president *I'd* be buying stocks right now'. Wonder if he noticed the irony 45 yrs later.
610 2018-06-25 19:13:22 It’s been weeks of downward action as the “trade war” talk heats up. Stocks are all connected (thanks ETF’s!) and the highest flying ones ($NFLX lately) get hit the hardest in a sell off. Doesn’t matter if it doesn’t have anything to do with China.
611 2018-06-25 19:13:16 lol. I never messed with stocks, so I've only known crypto.  I imagine if I went into stocks I would pull my hair out waiting for a 2% gain.
612 2018-06-25 19:13:04 According to CNBC @CNBCClosingBell just now stocks are doing worse now under #trump than under #ghwbush. #thankstrump #StockMarket Dow is down 400+ points.
613 2018-06-25 19:12:46 Damn my gold and stocks dropping in money today
614 2018-06-25 19:12:30 Had a girl approach me about stocks and was instantly turned on 
615 2018-06-25 19:12:25 When the UK was outside of the EU, UK  companies held huge stocks. This now is regarded as lost profit. Companies profit revolves on pallet storage capacity, profit and loss analysis. And manufacturing, within the just in time ethos.
616 2018-06-25 19:12:16 “Anyone trying to make money by trading stocks is either a scammer or a fool! It’s almost impossible to predict what the market is going to do!”
617 2018-06-25 19:12:02 If/when stocks crash in the Fall, yes. But they will explode higher from there when the Fed does an 180 towards #QE and the dollar begins its inexorable slide imho.
618 2018-06-25 19:11:59 Today was not a good day to check my stocks.
619 2018-06-25 19:11:42 A bad day on Wall Street. The DOW, S&P, and especially the tech stocks on the NASDEC are sharply down. This is the effects of tariffs. There'll be profit taking now and then, but the trend is constant decline until the trade war is over. And that'll last as long as Mr. Trump.

626 2018-06-25 19:10:45 You're  sooo stupid! Stock exchange was stagnant under 0bama. Trump's added 5 trillion. How is that Obama's accomplishment? Take it from someone who actually owns plenty stocks & bonds 0bama was an economic failure!
627 2018-06-25 19:10:12 Is it better to wait and see if it keeps going lower? I wonder if it's time to buy now or wait for the ST bottom to be defined.

Funny thing how people see stocks at a discount differently than say a car or TV.

629 2018-06-25 19:09:16 Amazing that with the rout in stocks, bonds can barely get a bid. Oh my how times have changed!
630 2018-06-25 19:09:05 But Trump wants to sell fear like the whole world is coming through the border.
631 2018-06-25 19:08:52 Whether I’m shopping socks or stocks, I like to buy quality merchandise at discounted prices.
632 2018-06-25 19:08:11 I love stocks too! Always grab some when I see them on sale fleetingly at the supermarket. Such a delicate but heady scent.
633 2018-06-25 19:08:00 We were talking about stocks.

Look, youre a blatant liar. Youve lied about everything.

 So, carry on lying and lets touch base again when cohen and or manafort flip.

637 2018-06-25 19:06:44 “Stocks fall on trade war fears.”

Yes, that’s why Netflix is down 7%. 

Stocks are down because stocks are down. Trying to pin daily stock price action on specific reasons is silly.

646 2018-06-25 19:03:30 It's bullish for energy and PM stocks to be holding up relatively well during today's carnage.

662 2018-06-25 18:57:35 And yet, the DJIA is currently down by over 470 points. I'm not optimistic when a moron decides a trade war is good for this country. I bet Dinky Donnie and the Trump family shorted stocks based upon insider info from @realDonaldTrump? #ReleaseTaxReturns
663 2018-06-25 18:57:23 On the way down keep in mind that 6/8 stocks drove the all market higher, dont be surprised with some strength of A/D on this leg lower
664 2018-06-25 18:57:22 Understandable.  Probably "3 day rule" is not only about specific stocks, but also to the market overall...  BTW, check out $FNKO.  I've been mentioning for a while now. Its green today. It "means something"
665 2018-06-25 18:57:02 Is that before or after the stocks took a tumble. How about before or after the farmers and pork producers started to lose millions of dollars?

680 2018-06-25 18:51:31 Stocks usually spike in the morning then dip down in the afternoon just before they begin an uptrend. Just buy the dip and hold on

683 2018-06-25 18:50:44 Interesting. Yeah, I found the super low stocks/DBPM (worse than Trae!!!!) incongruous with the write up of his D being sound. Although, I'm likely totally wrong but seems like a pest w/ good positioning/smart should do better on steals right?
684 2018-06-25 18:49:35 Great thing about the Dow now, it's actually being driven by the economy. Not over printing of fiat/over valuing stocks.
685 2018-06-25 18:49:13 Wichita State defense was bad as a whole which dragged down his DBPM I would think and he just isn’t really a stocks type of guy. But if you watch him play, he’s consistently involved and plays hard. Obv lacking in strength and high-end length, but still is a pest

689 2018-06-25 18:47:49 U.S. stocks sank in a broad sell-off on Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping more than 1.5% and technology firms bearing the brunt of an escalating trade dispute between the United States and other leading economies.
690 2018-06-25 18:47:41 Okay, I'm missing this stocks and flows reference. What do you mean here ?

692 2018-06-25 18:46:10 Stocks are tanking due to the trade war.
693 2018-06-25 18:46:00 I’ve always maintained the position that the ES will eventually puke the 200dma but I’m shocked it’s stood up this long. These trade wars will not be good for stocks.

698 2018-06-25 18:44:52 Working theory: because people care more about stocks than flows.

783 2018-06-25 18:12:46 Sorry to disappoint but Assets waapis milna bohat mushkil hae. itna he kaafi hae ke log in ko nikal ker apna future darust ker laen
Assets have been dispersed into places & accounts you can’t even dream off. Sharifs invested 1 Billion USD in NY stocks ..can anyone locate it?
784 2018-06-25 18:12:45 I have no respect for a man who renounced being an American to save $ and equated making $ to smoking crack. No introspection to buying poor Russians stocks and the impact on the average Russian citizen.
785 2018-06-25 18:12:17 I don't find business interesting at all. Which is why I don't analyse stocks. Has to be something macro.

792 2018-06-25 18:09:36 Baloney. When corporate taxes are cut and profits go up, top management gets a raise and stocks are bought back. When corporate tax rates are increased, money is invested back into the company to reduce taxes. Economics 101. It's no wonder you dopes are failing. @POTUS @GOP
793 2018-06-25 18:09:12 You’ve got @RepMaxineWaters @NancyPelosi @senchuckschumer @AdamSchiffCA running your party. Laughing stocks of liberalism! Please bro, get a clue!

795 2018-06-25 18:07:47 Portfolio rebalancing: Sold $QD and $IQ. I love both names, but in light of the new rhetoric, I think Chinese stocks are going to get worse before they get better. I'll revisit both in sunnier times. China is capable of playing dirtier than the US.

809 2018-06-25 18:01:33 There's no inherent problem with there being more indexes than stocks! There IS, perhaps, a problem with an industry that sells based on the perception of investment strategies as self-evidently passive because they are based on an index.

811 2018-06-25 18:00:56 I don't think this is the only reason. Too many others stand to gain - vulture capitalists who will swoop in and asset-strip distressed companies, hedgies shorting stocks & currencies, rightwingers who want to use chaos to privatise the NHS.

But is it a contributing factor? Yup.

818 2018-06-25 18:00:00 these stock analysts make up a different reason every day, today it's this, next day the previous day's thing was fixed (I guess) as stocks go up, next day something is bad, next day it's fixed, etc.
819 2018-06-25 17:58:06 Thing 1: note that stocks have been taking a dive due to trump’s reckless policies

Thing 2: approval for tax”reform” is down 10 pts, to 34%

Thing 3: trump’s immigration hysteria is UP to deflect from #taxscam

827 2018-06-25 17:54:54 less than a quarter of those got big tax cuts, invested in the people and jobs. More than 75% re-invested on the stocks. You can't put a positive spin on something so corrupt and inaccurate.
828 2018-06-25 17:54:32 Of course if you’re going to make analogy you need to point out that the powerful and elite were never put into the stocks. No, corporeal punishment was limited to the poor and weak.

830 2018-06-25 17:53:20 Tax cuts to big business who already sit on a pile of money, then a trade war is threated that drives stock values down. Retired people watch their portfolio lose so they sell off. Then business but stocks at discount. Trade war hoax ends, stock too expensive to obtain.

912 2018-06-25 17:24:11 Well eric have you seen the stocks today not looking so good! By November will see how the economy is doing then! People will be finding out how high their insurance premiums will be in 2019! #TheResistance #VoteBlue2018
913 2018-06-25 17:24:07 You are welcome, Nat. One of the beauties of the markets is that past price/volume data can be used to go back and see what outcome resulted from x happening. So you can go back and see what % of the time a hammer that undercut a prior low actually worked #stocks
914 2018-06-25 17:23:48 Sorry suppose to say "stocks" not sticks.

917 2018-06-25 17:23:28 Summer stocks should focus more on cleaning their filthy canopies, doors & windows (badly need paint jobs) & their non-equity semen covered cast housing rather than refusing to do actual good shows like CATS.

949 2018-06-25 17:13:50 ^ I don’t get why bitcoin bulls think a stock market crash will somehow prop up the price of bitcoin. When stocks come down, ppl usually jump to bonds. Not some speculative shit asset class that doesn’t do anything but selling you a ideology.

952 2018-06-25 17:13:26 maybe - I think that there is a huge optimism premium baked into stocks rn, so to see some of that skim off isn't a huge shock
953 2018-06-25 17:12:41 The higher they go, the harder they fall. Let's see how high they get before mathematics tells us they'll fall. Oh and today's move down in stocks is making me feel like early February. An omen for oil. Me thinks the current daily fractal cycle lasts this week before a waterfall.

955 2018-06-25 17:11:48 My theory: Step 1: Trump tells billionaire buddies he’s going to start a trade war; Step 2: Billionaire buddies sell short; Step 3: Trump starts trade war; Step 4: Stocks fall; Step 5: Billionaire buddies clean up.
956 2018-06-25 17:11:29 I am amazed USDJPY hasn't blown out the lows yet with stocks where they are.
957 2018-06-25 17:11:09 Dont you see its Trump's plan.. 
start a trade war=stocks to drop
Trump companies invests in the low market.
Trump pulls back on tariffs = stocks recover = Trump gets richer.

1036 2018-06-25 16:52:37 Sure not like you have anything else to do but spread lies and hate. The Tax plan is staring to fail, the tariffs are slapping you in the face, children are not returned, laws are not followed, EPA chief breaking the law, watching stocks go south. Save trip!
1037 2018-06-25 16:52:31 I never invested but created a dummy portfolio back in 2014 May. Mostly stocks from hospitality, food, diary and power sector. I must say that at one point the overall growth was around 35% but now crashed to 1%

Pick whatever lesson you want from that

1042 2018-06-25 16:49:22 Not as exciting as a straight short, however those stocks got really hot a few months ago and it was a good risk 1 to make 4 way of protecting against some wacky potential takeover at some crazy price.

1051 2018-06-25 16:48:01 So far, strong trend day for stocks. Will be interesting to see if a mid day range sets up for another large move in the last hour.
1052 2018-06-25 16:48:01 How do you put America First if you put $hog Harley Davidson and Farmers last? For all the rhetoric, Trumps inartful negotiating strategy is doing more harm than good. Stocks getting crushed. #tariffs #stocks #americafirst

1089 2018-06-25 16:33:08 Highly doubtful that it acts as initial fuel. But, if crypto starts booming while stocks plummet, then yes, I bet Wallstreet will get hungry for some action and hop over for a bit of fun.

Americans will also easily experience tremendous risk; U.S. stocks will soon enough also plummet -3%ish for a single day."

1125 2018-06-25 16:24:30 Talking about the promotors and high  valuation due to good management.. 
This seems clear gambling kind of approach with investing in poorly managed company & one can see the pain faced due to that recently on all his suggested stocks..

1146 2018-06-25 16:18:41 The correct answer is that for mainstream retail adoption, the price on the tag has to be in $NANO. For that to happen, the retailer costs (salaries, stocks...) have to be paid in $NANO too. Costing in the entire value chain in $NANO is the only way to get there. Unlikely!

1215 2018-06-25 15:56:34 Yeah and I'm sure that Trump owns stocks or gets kickbacks from these companies.  It's why he won't release his taxes.  When will journalists do an hour long expose on this for the American public?

1221 2018-06-25 15:55:47 there were plenty of warnings for vol to increase, they've just been dismissed. BTFD on an uninterrupted 9 year run higher for stocks despite any negative news became habit. Vol caught inv off guard in Feb, March, April & now. Time to give vol a little more respect.

1229 2018-06-25 15:53:19 Problem is retail dont buy when markets are in bear grip fearing further loss. They sell after losing more than 60% when max downside is further 40%. Offcourse we cant lose even that 40%, but exception can be made at good stocks.

1293 2018-06-25 15:35:25 Stocks, bonds, lira all down with Mr Market's love for Erdogan victory only lasted half an hour (a summary of my love life). Even news flow around ending the state of emergency could not manage to save the day.
1294 2018-06-25 15:35:08 Trump is manipulating the stock market for his on agenda. Raisesthe tariffs and buys all stocks at a low price then here in a month he decides he isn’t going to go through with it and removes the tariff and the stock goes back up and him and his family sells and makes a killing.
1295 2018-06-25 15:34:49 Doubt it. Bond Yields would likely soar in such a scenario. Can have your cake and eat it? Either Bonds and the Dollar rise and stocks fall or Bonds and Stocks rise and the dollar falls, but they can't allow the bond market to collapse, that would bring down the system.
1296 2018-06-25 15:34:16 i’ve often seen people who have no idea what it means to live hand-to-mouth say that poor people should just buy stocks, and honestly? you might as well just tell them to buy scratch-offs. that would actually be better advice.

1308 2018-06-25 15:31:20 While making America again, Trump's policies apparently started to take their toll on Turkey with rumors around a tariff hike on autos being imported from Europe to the States causing a sharp fall in Turkish car makers' stocks. Ford Otosan and Tofas were down 10% and 8.3% today.

1334 2018-06-25 15:24:33 The downside to having a concentrated portfolio in low volume stocks is that you go from +15% for the year to -2% in a single morning. On virtually zero volume. Investing in micro caps ain't for -------.
1335 2018-06-25 15:24:32 This is Bloomberg's globalist propaganda. The stocks that would be hit most, aka US food packaging companies, are doing BEST.

1456 2018-06-25 14:45:54 Stocks go up. Stocks go down. Know your levels. Pick good R/R spots to enter relatively strong names. Don’t panic sell but stick to plan. Pullbacks are part of the game. These pullbacks also give you an opportunity to re-evaluate your portfolio and get rid of relative weakness.

1476 2018-06-25 14:39:24 My data says retail is massively and complacently long US growth stocks. Amazing given the risks.
1477 2018-06-25 14:39:01 Mostly the answer to why has a stock fallen so much is in the question why did it run up so much in the first place? Not to mean that the company is bad but we need to realise market over reacts on both sides and sometimes stocks correct as a reaction to that over-reaction.

1503 2018-06-25 14:30:05 The 50 SMA will be crucial for both the $SPY and for leading stocks.   The $SPY could very will spend the summer trading around its 50 day.  Leaders will need to rebuild bases above their 50 SMA .  A sustained move below the 50 day for either would shift pressure to downside.
1504 2018-06-25 14:29:49 Just watch the big stocks and the indicies as they fall into logical support areas such as the 20 and 50d MAs. $SPX just hit the 50d MA and we see a first reaction rally as a result.

1545 2018-06-25 14:16:24 I have totally stopped trading Nifty positionally for the last 15 days or so, ignoring all system trades . Individual stocks are still giving returns whether long or short
1546 2018-06-25 14:16:10 Many stocks destroyed today. Knowing what market you are in and when your positions are vulnerable is key to longevity in this game.
1547 2018-06-25 14:16:00 Mojo you’ve got, thanks for giving the boost to our readers and the stocks you bring can lead readers to you. The New Investors need a perk to give them confidence. We know how to find gems  they may not.
1548 2018-06-25 14:15:27 Now the big question is: which of Trump‘s (and associates!) business ventures are going to profit from this, and who purchase/sold stocks based on what they knew Trump was going to do.
1549 2018-06-25 14:15:25 That traders are acutely concerned about the near-term risks to stocks in a way that is quite abnormal.

1552 2018-06-25 14:14:57 #MondayFinanceLesson Why don't I recommend single stocks to those who are brand new to investing? 
1.) Single stocks bring a lot of risk with them. Too much risk for new investors unless you have $25K-$50K to start and can construct a diversified portfolio of 10-15 stocks.
1553 2018-06-25 14:14:38 . @realDonaldTrump @POTUS just lost his wallstreet buds. Best #stocks down again. If the economy tanks, he and @HouseGOP @SenateGOP are done, we can't feed your immigration and tariffs to our families.

1557 2018-06-25 14:13:09 If you follow their stocks or know anything about the company, you would not be surprised. However, blaming tariffs on Matt Levatich’s mismanagement is silly. Pushing back the release of the E-bike was a huge mistake for Harley-Davidson.

1589 2018-06-25 14:01:02 $CLA is a much preferred Co play in comparison. I can only assume you feel differently, hence the repeated down-ramping of stocks you don't hold. Nonetheless, good luck with $WFE. It doesn't interest me.

1692 2018-06-25 13:22:07 As a businessperson it looks like corporate bosses must be getting $$ pandering propaganda, so it will continue.  Hwvr, shareholders push back at some point b/c they purchased media stocks, not marketing/advertising/advocacy stocks...
A real journo would not deliver propaganda
1693 2018-06-25 13:22:03 Avoid having an investment process that starts with looking for cheap stocks. Instead, have one that starts with looking for high-quality businesses that produce large and growing distributable cash flows.

1695 2018-06-25 13:21:58 I appreciate it. The onboard staff have been brilliant in a difficult situation, however water is now having to be rationed. Considering the high ticket price this train “service” is unacceptable. Can we expect any compensation for the lack of amenities?
1696 2018-06-25 13:21:04 Can fin , PNB were all high quality businesses when stocks prices were rising. And now when prices are coming down it's termed as low quality.

Many good stocks HIGHLY overvalued as too much money chasing too few stocks.

4 ways forward 
1. Stock prices crash & scare the hell out of investors 
2. Cash deluge subsides
3. Number of good companies increase
4. Rapid biz growth is shown by good stocks
1735 2018-06-25 12:55:03 Agreed, if you do Call O then be careful and think of the ca 50% on AVERAGE stocks variation any given 52 weeks - Tesla should have correct value of 
2018  - 300-450
2019  - 450-675
2020  - 675-1100
50% variation so O calls should max be in the high middle 2018 - 400 Sep/Dec

1848 2018-06-25 11:52:07 Side-advice: By the time you are 30, you should have double your annual income saved.

If you don't, that's okay - but definitely look towards saving for retirement (Roth IRA) and having an aggressive portfolio while you're young (stocks).

1855 2018-06-25 11:48:37 The startup tech world is the new finance. People seem to value their importance by the alleged, future value of their stocks.

1856 2018-06-25 11:48:31 Oddly enough. Stocks, not really part of the standards for Econ. Seems like they should be but they aren’t.

1923 2018-06-25 10:50:54 Something is now right with the current market scenario. Although Nifty is hardly 3.65% off from ATH's, most traders and investors have their PF's down by 30-50% (even if its a mix of large caps). So, basically whatever people are holding is going down and high vale stocks are
1924 2018-06-25 10:50:22 Nifty : 10762.45 down by -59.4 points (-0.55%)
Sensex : 35470.35 down by -219.25 points (-0.61%)

Former involves more macro judgement (track record of returns | not deviating from core investment philosophy | AUM etc). Better to invest in stocks if analysing individual stock.

2079 2018-06-25 08:46:17 Also, you can’t borrow to buy stocks even if you leave them as collateral to the bank, so less ability to leverage. These distorsions + tax distorsions make it hard for the emh to work imho.
2080 2018-06-25 08:45:29 I’m excited with short selling in the stock market (and hopefully in the fixed income market, too, soon) because it helps accelerate the correction of overpriced stocks.

2160 2018-06-25 07:21:29 I think they should. Well, bump stocks I'm ambivalent about. Bump fire is just a technique. You don't need a tool for it. 

 I thought about that, but that wasn't a school so I'm technically correct. 

 I think that there are better ways to deal with this than ban stuff.

2168 2018-06-25 07:14:37 So it was a clear quality stocks trend after this 10% correction of Nifty.

We've been so obsessed with these smallcap/midcap frenzy

2333 2018-06-25 04:36:27 The fact that you think bump stocks and the AR platform are scary. Shows your complete ignorance of bump stocks and rifles. And have no valid arguement to stand on about said subjects.

2348 2018-06-25 04:18:10 Me and a buddy both have computer science degrees and we tried making algorithms that could trade penny stocks. They are not liquid enough and are too manipulated to implement a strategy that can consistently be profitable. However, I wish you success in what we failed at.

2531 2018-06-25 01:45:32 These cars need 2 things, bias ply tires and a rule or group of rules that will prevent these cars from sitting on the ground and being glued to the track. If you look across the country, some of the most exciting weekly racing you see is street stocks. Make them drive like that!
2532 2018-06-25 01:41:21 Think about it @netflix @hulu @AmazonStudios @YouTube, if one of you #SaveTimeless, you will see an increase in your stocks. Renew #Timeless that way fans (like me) can pay for a subscription in order to watch it. Win-win.
2533 2018-06-25 01:39:34 Next massive bubble to pop is weed stocks.
2534 2018-06-25 01:35:29 I guess I left an important part out. why do you even want to short? To be one of the cool kids? All the guys I know are trying to learn how to long stocks. Your risk mgmt better be spot on shorting or you're gonna get killed.

2537 2018-06-25 01:28:29 On Marin’s deal is there a minimum $ for each investment or can I start with a small amount for each stock & can his recommendations be bought on a US market? I can buy OTC stocks but not the TSX?
2538 2018-06-25 01:26:56 My positive for the day, loving listening to jazz fest downtown and not looking at stocks!!!
2539 2018-06-25 01:26:26 and sessions' family holds PRISON STOCKS ! ! ! HOW many other rePUKEns also hold PRISON STOCKS???? lining their own pockets
2540 2018-06-25 01:26:05 Maybe regular investors are finding bank stocks to be expensive, so banks are buying their own stock to keep the prices from falling too much.
2541 2018-06-25 01:25:58 @ChessTrades Great video as always Chess.  Thank you for covering my requested stocks. Very helpful.
2542 2018-06-25 01:25:47 bless you — really, really happy, overjoyed even, that you're leaving the business on what sounds like your own terms, unlike so many of my friends, and former colleagues, who were summarily dismissed as a cost-cutting measure, like so many penny stocks.
2543 2018-06-25 01:23:46 The legend of shoeless "molly" joe...  phenomenal stock analysis who went on to fame with @thecannalysts.  Molly earned his nickname by picking cannabis stocks while his Dack shoes weren't broken in.

2545 2018-06-25 01:20:06 u took 11 stocks though thats still rly good

2547 2018-06-25 01:19:03 Pass laws to ban bump stocks and raise legal age to purchase guns
2548 2018-06-25 01:18:28 Inventories, updating etsy shop, stocks and prepping orders. My kind of morning. This, before anything else.
2549 2018-06-25 01:18:22 That's not gonna be good for stocks tomorrow.
2550 2018-06-25 01:17:48 Financing is better and has nothing do with affording it or not. For example, why pay $60,000 upfront for a boat when you can pay $2,000 upfront and invest $58,000 long term(stocks, etc.) make more than what the interest rate is charging + more and still end up paying $60,000.

2552 2018-06-25 01:15:48 LMFAO, I just spent maybe 2 hours researching safe stocks I could afford, so that I could expand my portfolio past videogame companies (EA, SQNXF, ATVI, and NTDOY have been CRUSHING!), and my computer nearly had a seizure - I had to force quit everything & re-launch Finder...!!!!
2553 2018-06-25 01:15:26 We need to ban bump stocks now!
2554 2018-06-25 01:15:21 I think that sounds perfect...and efficient. My first 10 dates with my husband consisted of him making dinner (he used to be a chef)- and then doing dishes. We go out when we travel. Now we research stocks on Friday nights... so... Learn to love it.

2556 2018-06-25 01:14:18 Also sold stocks! But Google is still controlled! BTW so did Facebook same day? Selling his stocks? So did rothchilds selling everything? That EO was against pedofilia trafficking and child porn and any company who is connected in any way Treasury can freeze all assets?

2565 2018-06-25 01:07:45 Grab driver suddenly asked for financial advise – what stocks to buy, should he go long on the dollar. I didn’t even introduce myself as anything. 
2566 2018-06-25 01:05:24 Ban Bump Stocks!
2567 2018-06-25 01:03:40 From today will try to post stock updates to show the performance of the tool which is planned to be released in few month's. Hold till 9:10am for sure shot stocks update with level

2572 2018-06-25 00:57:41 Ban Bump stocks!!!
2573 2018-06-25 00:55:45 Absolutely bump stocks should be banned. This is not a partisan issue.
2574 2018-06-25 00:55:42 2 major bear markets in stocks in the last 18 years plus a massive bear market in real estate.  Pretty much unprecedented.
2575 2018-06-25 00:55:34 The #Queensland Milk Bank's stocks are down to 100L and need donations as breast milk is vital for premmie babies. If you or someone you know might be able to help, please share or send an email to milk_bank_rbwh@health.qld.gov.au @MetroNorthHHS

2578 2018-06-25 00:52:48 Added legs to $FOXF, $TIF, and $TSCO based on 5% incremental rises.  No new stocks added this week.  Eying $EBS but it might fall below 50DMA so I'm holding off for now.  Sold $GLD.
2579 2018-06-25 00:52:34 Hey, Stewie! I know you love those "Power Earnings Gap" stocks. Check out what $KMX did Friday. ATH high, 10% short interest. Does it fit the bill for your P.E.G. watch list?
2580 2018-06-25 00:50:02 Where did you buy these stocks? Are these trades or Long term investments ??
2581 2018-06-25 00:49:13 As much as I eat bojangles I should own some stocks by now or some
2582 2018-06-25 00:47:32 @traderstewie i am holding IQ, ZUO and PVTL and extremely scared about keeping all these looking at how these stocks are moving. Please advice as to what is the right thing to do at the moment
2583 2018-06-25 00:46:44 When stocks rise, it has little to no effect on wages and income of people who don't own stocks. But if they fall, they have an assured negative impact on the labor force. I hope those who keep on harping about bear market = cheap stocks = more chance to buy, think about this.

2585 2018-06-25 00:46:13 I enjoy looking at charts posted by other Traders. It's interesting to see what indicators people prefer to use when analyzing their stocks.
2586 2018-06-25 00:38:53 Lies. We want all humans no matter skin color to have a chance for a better life. But you know what is true? Republicans can easily pass a law that bans bump stocks and ups the legal age to purchase a gun to 21 like you promised. Why has this not been done?
2587 2018-06-25 00:38:38 We knew it would be the case once the Private prison stocks rose after the election. Private sector is a public vice!
2588 2018-06-25 00:38:05 Your truly delusional! Our heath care rates dropped with great coverage.  Income went up, to the point our family is thriving, not just survivng. Despite fear mogers stocks and economy is booming unlike the past 16 years! Educate your self on FAIR trade, and how it will help!
2589 2018-06-25 00:36:50 Kitty bump stocks are only for fools and those who can't shootGive your rights to bought and paid for politicians who work for the same globalists who want open borders and hate this country if you want to but leave the rest of us alone Open your eyes  America First
2590 2018-06-25 00:35:24 He also tweeted (on official WH account btw) bad stuff about Amazon, then their stocks dropped, then kept doing it and their stock continued to plummet..all because he hates the WPost/Bezos
Sarah tried to do the same thing

2606 2018-06-25 00:20:58 Research would suggest otherwise... that being said, I'd settle for universal background checks, banning bump stocks and assault rifles. #GunReformNow
2607 2018-06-25 00:20:27 Big banks are expected to get the green light from the Federal Reserve to "shower their shareholders" with increased dividends and share repurchases, and announcements of capital returns could provide a lift to bank stocks, Andrew Bary wrote in this week's edition of Barron's.

2612 2018-06-25 00:18:18 I'm afraid it's even more insidious than that.  Private prison stocks skyrocketed on Trump's election and now we see why.  I'm no expert but maybe incarcerated children are particularly lucrative in terms of billable services.  Can anyone shed any light?  #MigrantChildren
2613 2018-06-25 00:17:51 Hello and welcome to  CNBC. This is  bud with the latest business news. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  SHOO stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNBC.

2617 2018-06-25 00:10:09 Legally owned and just “disappeared”. Bump stocks gone. I’ve got a question for you? Doesn’t it bother you as a responsible gun owner that the NRA spend so much time fighting laws that are meant to prevent people who shouldn’t have guns getting them?
2618 2018-06-25 00:08:08 Economy up, Regulations way down. 2.5 million new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.0%. Biz, stocks, manufacturing way up- record levels! America safer; we have great respect around the world. Making friends and allies, exposing enemies. Most of all people and God first in USA!
2619 2018-06-25 00:06:52 Asia stocks begin the week mostly higher following PBoC RRR cut and the similar performance in US last Friday where energy was underpinned by OPEC+ agreement and DJIA snapped an 8-day losing streak; ASX 200 (+0.3%), Nikkei 225 (+0.1%), KOSPI (-0.6%)
2620 2018-06-25 00:06:51 We should stop all salmon fishing in North Pacific region, for a 4 year salmon spawn cycle, allowing dwindling stocks to rebound...
