33 2018-07-05 21:38:28 Not really, commodities are a price-sensitive market that tends run in cycles anyway. Throw a market shifting technology like fracking into the mix and the cycles become volatile (ish) until the technology stabilizes. Still a good long term outlook.

50 2018-07-05 19:48:48 With respect Mr #Trump your statement clearly demonstrates that you know very little about commodities trading. You should consult with an economist and commodities trading experts before making such foolish statements.
51 2018-07-05 19:47:10 The spike in petroleum commodities markets are a direct result of the global instability & uncertainty YOU created by pulling out of the Iran deal. Who benefits?

122 2018-07-05 15:36:37 first step is making component costs cheaper: land, commodities, capital, and labor.

Land and capital costs are both distorted by government and banking interests. So the first step is to resolve this distortion. No small task, but doable.
123 2018-07-05 15:36:29 so somewhere in my research i wanted to understand this shift - we decry consumerism but manufacture commodities.  my supervisor suggested it was a research topic on its own and to get back to my subject.  also freeing, especially because we had a 10K word limit!

124 2018-07-05 15:33:12 If commodities resolve higher like a lot are noticing, I’ll be happy I was only ~2 years too early.
125 2018-07-05 15:32:58 Neither. 
I don't trade commodities anymore. 
A long time ago I had to sign an agreement to not not trade as to stay objective in the markets I analyze.
126 2018-07-05 15:31:29 (13) Polanyi's influence is direct via historicity of capitalism, fictitious commodities angle, top-down creation of market society, etc. But also indirect influence via econ anthropology: combined with Chayanov, post-war "peasant studies" helps consolidate the "enclosure myth"
127 2018-07-05 15:20:17 By the way GS is extremely wrong about #commodities! 

1. Capex numbers around the world don’t justify an investment boom

2. Global economy and China will slow down 

3. Yuan will not reverse its current course 

4. Yields will continue higher 

5. Cyclicals already lose steam
128 2018-07-05 15:12:26 I agree with this but I do think that the finished product cannot exist w/o both so both should be compensated & credited comparably. It’s not about “more work” or “more time” - it’s simply the fact that both artist & author sell commodities of equal value to the end product.
129 2018-07-05 15:06:30 funny, given that commodities typically fall in price when the USD rises…. but wtv, I’m sure GS is looking out for our best interests
