1 2018-12-28 23:56:34 I’d like to learn about stocks and what the market entails.
2 2018-12-28 23:56:18 The #PermanentPortfolio up 0.30% on Friday.

VTI -0.13% #stocks
TLT +0.84% #bonds
IAU +0.49% #gold

As the stock market swung wildly this week, the Permanent Portfolio was smooth and steady:

W: +0.91%
Th: +0.38%
F: +0.30%
3 2018-12-28 23:54:38 The recent market pull back has helped a lot. Was struggling to find an entry point in these stocks. What else do you have on your radar?
4 2018-12-28 23:51:35 It is current priced at an overvalued amount. Without huge growth I think the price will flatten out eventually. 
Plus I have done very well shorting the stocks gerber recommends. Except Tesla, I wont short that one.
5 2018-12-28 23:51:30 How about you put a photo of yourself as an elderly, black woman, and see in anyone is interested in your opinion on Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain and  Stocks,
6 2018-12-28 23:51:20 Economy is great. ISIS almost defeated Turkey will clean up. Unemployment highest ever. Highest number of companies coming back to America. Stocks are up except for last week. What is so bad about trump.

40 2018-12-28 23:38:26 My point is - those details are important. If they own say $50k in stocks and $5k is in WF or other big banks - does that automatically disqualify? I get where you are going - just a little too simplistic.
41 2018-12-28 23:37:47 Thing is, I feel we are searching for market plumbing explanations when none is obvious (unlike in February). Not saying they are wrong, just a bit... ex post rationalizing. Maybe the selloff was too violent because... people sold a lot of stocks? Not super helpful, I know.
42 2018-12-28 23:37:36 If Teddy Bridgewater does well in his start on Sunday with all the weapons the Saints have his stocks going to go up so much for the dolphins to pay, Ross is going to be So mad he didn’t fire Tanabaum earlier
43 2018-12-28 23:37:35 Depois tinha que tar a orientar os stocks enganados que isso só da dores de cabeça
44 2018-12-28 23:36:17 No. Why don't you just unload your war stocks, support peace, and mow your own lawn - like reasonable Americans.
45 2018-12-28 23:35:56 I went ahead and pulled the trigger on a few tech stocks,  $TME being one, actually in the stead of Spotify, I may need to send TME my Ohiory666 music catalog  I also have a handful of little known tech stocks to research, see if I can find a gem  Good Day.. & Trade well 
46 2018-12-28 23:35:22 *stocks up on maca root*
47 2018-12-28 23:35:19 TRUMP: I’m taking away gun rights by banning bump stocks which were previously legal to purchase. You will not be paid any compensation even though they cost up to $400 each.                                    TRUMP SUPPORTERS: It’s Obama’s fault.
48 2018-12-28 23:33:03 I am really fed up with business reporters stating that stocks see the economy differently. Stocks don’t see. Most trades are run by bots. Humanizing this mechanized market hides the mathematical corruption.
49 2018-12-28 23:33:00 Stocks crashing and his approval ratings drifting lower. This is beneficial?
50 2018-12-28 23:32:02 The bump was a year-end portfolio rebalancing. My free cash is in precious metals, only about 15% of my assets, but money managers like Goldman Sachs have the other 60% locked in till term. They must hold certain percentages of stocks, cash & bonds when our statements get mailed.

52 2018-12-28 23:30:30 I bet u accounts that have thousands of followers watch their follower count like some stocks
53 2018-12-28 23:30:06 Get your tickets now! Until stocks last!
54 2018-12-28 23:29:10 I should see if that's the size of the other GMT games I have with many cards. I assume it is, to cut costs in different game stocks.
55 2018-12-28 23:28:39 Market delta only meant for futures trading , not stocks or options. #forex
56 2018-12-28 23:27:47 Should we bring back Ducking stools, stocks & Pillories for the breaking of #Parliamentary code.
57 2018-12-28 23:27:06 

You are either very rich, which your profile suggests otherwise,  and have not accounted for the hit to your stocks yet, or you are ... less than honest. 

Either way you are a bore
58 2018-12-28 23:24:53 But it’s her money and you still made a profit, if they can’t afford the palette she didn’t do them a dis service and for when it’s out of stock like maybe you should make bigger stocks or something? I get ruining it is disrespectful but again it’s still their money.
59 2018-12-28 23:24:22 In other words, no human can beat considtency and accuracy of a computer that can watch every single tick of any or all stocks without ever loosing attention regardless if the investment is long term or just a few minutes.
60 2018-12-28 23:22:24 Stocks posted their best day in nearly a decade on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average notching its largest one-day point gain in history.
61 2018-12-28 23:21:49 Let us trade penny stocks!
62 2018-12-28 23:20:15 I think all that is done already. They won’t risk waiting until last day to make any big moves. Heavy selling today into the liquidity of pension rebalance trade does not bode well for stocks going forward IMO
63 2018-12-28 23:19:16 Yeah it was a good time to own some individual stocks. I work at Adobe now and our stock has absolutely crushed. I owned some even before this job and now I get a nice ESPP too.
64 2018-12-28 23:17:33 Wow!
The S&P500 will be down another 10%+ by the end January.
Don't lose your shirt buddy.
This appears be the beginning of the bear market, not the end... Economic indicators will also tell you this.
What sectors/stocks have you been buying into?
65 2018-12-28 23:17:17 Lately I’ve been investing my money in property, stocks, & other business ventures. My goal is to be making twice as much money next year.
66 2018-12-28 23:17:16 Not everyone should own a gun just because they want to. I wouldn’t want my mentality I’ll neighbor owning a gun.  Bump stocks are unnecessary and dangerous in the wrong hands.
67 2018-12-28 23:16:39 Yes, I have 4 stocks in the industry and im surprised only one is going that fast
68 2018-12-28 23:16:22 Nice website to track the stages you have there. Was checking it out. Is there any way to get the least favorite sectors in the market right now using your screener in order to research some stocks to short. Wanted to pick some underperforming
stocks in under performing sectors.
69 2018-12-28 23:16:16 I think it'd be good strategy to short fitness company stocks for any date in February, but methinks that's probably already priced into any such securities by the time you'd decide to buy them shortly after the New year.
70 2018-12-28 23:16:04 You totally don’t get what this is, Litecoin and Bitcoin are not stocks. They combine the properties of a currency and a payment network. Unless you understand what they are, you shouldn’t comment about it.
71 2018-12-28 23:14:48 "2 stocks Final Destination no items"
72 2018-12-28 23:14:48 Actually,  we switched from generic eco to cheapo as stocks were very low in the store
73 2018-12-28 23:14:45 I’m really feeling DK. Played like 8 online matches, got at least 6 stocks with spikes and lost only once
74 2018-12-28 23:13:31 #DeleteFacebook sell Facebook stocks will you still can.
75 2018-12-28 23:13:27 Money shouldn’t be an investment or a get-rich-quick scheme. There are plenty of stocks for that.
76 2018-12-28 23:13:11 Sounds good.  Now FORCE her to divest from her fossil fuel stocks/investments, etc.
77 2018-12-28 23:12:55 It’s Back.For Saturday the 29th we are selling Top Quality Kilkenny ,Striploin Steaks at €4 each or 4 for €15.Affordable quality while stocks last.We also have 30% off Striploin Roast at Only €17.50/kg.
78 2018-12-28 23:10:48 Make them sell all the darned stocks, invest in diversified mutual funds, quit whining and do their jobs.
79 2018-12-28 23:10:44 You're fucking high if you think you should be able to kill 0% 
If ganon dies second then you can legit just ganoncide all 2 or 3 stocks. 
He has to die first, that way it's not completely busted but still really strong if you're a stock ahead.
80 2018-12-28 23:10:39 Extreme days, when stocks rise or fall 3% or more are examples of high volatility largely driven by algorithms and institutions $SPX $DJIA
81 2018-12-28 23:10:37 3 stocks each
82 2018-12-28 23:10:35 Was hoping you meant wood stocks to  put trump in and throw rotten tomatoes at his guilty orange arse
83 2018-12-28 23:10:17 Your stocks were even so it'd be sudden death if timeout.
84 2018-12-28 23:10:07 what stocks should i buy?  this is so confusing
85 2018-12-28 23:08:24 To smart ass DOE officials, who would admit that they have new fuel stocks? Truly smart people of Duterte who believe that he is the smartest president ever, smarter that GMA who is now a pencil pusher of the Neanderthal president.
86 2018-12-28 23:08:08 A federal ban on bump stocks was also recently passed. People have to destroy them or turn them in by march 21
87 2018-12-28 23:07:45 Hey Vii, The Glasglow and Glasglow Fort do. I'm afraid the only store in Edinburgh that stocks the Curves range is the Fort Store. Thanks, #NLLizzie
88 2018-12-28 23:04:50 All politicians should be required to not even own stocks, they should be clear and free of any influence. Many of you will wonder what kind of world I want to live in....
89 2018-12-28 23:04:32 Yeah too true. Unfortunately I lost all my money on the Dow Jones after Swampy sent stocks plunging...
90 2018-12-28 23:04:11 Last time I just bought it in my IRA a month or so before, got the credit, then set a limit order to sell it right when I got back.  Outside of a market meltdown or a big news story, they’re boring stocks that pay 3-4% in dividend
91 2018-12-28 23:03:44 The market is not looking good now anyway. For financial and ethical reasons it’s tine to sell the medical device stocks @TinaSmithMN.
Make it a win-win so I can do my thing and you do yours.
92 2018-12-28 23:03:36 Got my first coin from stocks
93 2018-12-28 23:02:24 You apparently have no clue. I find this VERY worrysome. Are you a MEDIC??? Please... do some research, you sound like you have stocks or could lose your job. Sorry... but as you have a large following you should be more aware.
94 2018-12-28 23:02:20 If you understood the economic cycle and how the stock markets works in relation to that you would also be buying US Bonds & Gold. If you're buying "because they look cheap" then you will sorely be disappointed when these stocks become a whole lot "cheaper".
95 2018-12-28 23:01:12 To help you maintain your laser sharp focus remember that your boss in effect pays your mortgage, stocks your fridge
96 2018-12-28 22:59:49 @Jak_McGuire  where should i start when trying to get into stocks

98 2018-12-28 22:58:05 Excellent ... after Mr. Smith sells the stocks.
Americans are sick and tired of  financial conflicts of interest.
99 2018-12-28 22:58:03 @HarfMaria Did U notice during the Obama admin, stocks did well, little GDP growth, 50M people on welfare, bankruptcies in the Solar Panel industry, $10T added to the debt we now pay $1B+/day in interest & we had the highest % of the workforce not working? U missed it I guess!

101 2018-12-28 22:57:02 classes of stocks were traded. "I guess they don't think much about aviation stocks," said Charley. "No, it's all
102 2018-12-28 22:56:26 I think overall his recovery got an indirect buff, because recoveries in general are worse now and he has three stocks to work with so losing one early isn't as big of a deal. It also feels like Dr. Tornado is slightly better than it was but I could be imagining it
103 2018-12-28 22:55:48 iRacing Rolex 24 but its just Miatas and Street Stocks.
104 2018-12-28 22:55:39 "COMMUNITY PUNISHMENT " ? The STOCKS works !
105 2018-12-28 22:55:20 Strange to see the 10y yield hit a new low while crude and stocks are well off their lows. They’re telling different stories here... Possibly due to year end flows? Otherwise I’m not too sure what to make of it, but it looks like someone is wrong.
106 2018-12-28 22:54:03 @realDonaldTrump stock market volatility helps stock traders tremendously. It also is great for long term investors as it allows stocks to be purchased at lower prices.
107 2018-12-28 22:53:33 I watched a little CNBC. I can tell even the smart few who are on are coached never to say anything bearish. Guys saying you can’t time the market. Forbes saying US stocks always go up. What a joke.
108 2018-12-28 22:52:49 blue chip owners will recover their money. real losers are followers of MAK type gurus who recommended penny satta stocks with no intrinsic value.
109 2018-12-28 22:52:41 I would laugh at the stupidity of what you just said, but I think I might scream because if you are being serious I will lose all faith in humanity. Remember when Bump stocks got banned solely to pander to democrats? Remember when Trump literally Was a democrat for 8 years?
110 2018-12-28 22:52:38 Ah but they didn’t bark in the restaurant or bar. They love Stocks too Happy pups.
111 2018-12-28 22:52:24 Can we remind Trump supporters that it is the Republicans coming after the bump stocks. I have had to personally deal with the idiots that believe Democrats will knock on your door and take your guns.
112 2018-12-28 22:52:14 Were people forced to invest in stocks that later crashed?

116 2018-12-28 22:50:43 “Still, the market’s downturn has left stocks substantially less expensive than they were heading into the fourth quarter” Johnston noted. And that sets up a good buying op...” she said... thinking to myself good buy op S&P 2485 IMAGINE SUB 2100!! Q1 2019

Advice? #IMPEACHTRUMP
119 2018-12-28 22:49:42 Learned how to trade a bear market. Set me up perfectly for what’s going down in stocks. (Pun intended) 
120 2018-12-28 22:47:04 So, after all of that hoopla and gloom-and-doom, stocks are up for the week.
121 2018-12-28 22:46:37 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 16% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 2% Positive. Stocks: $AVL was 20% Positive, with $ORE -1% Negative. #ASX
122 2018-12-28 22:46:11 Truly wonderful break in Sark at the Stocks Hotel. The chef is genius. All the crew are delightful. Thank you all xxxx
123 2018-12-28 22:45:53 Window dressing to make year-end fund statements look better (although the year is a loss for stocks).  The market test will be January 2nd.  I wouldn't be surprised if the market dropped 1000 pts. on Wednesday.
124 2018-12-28 22:45:13 Yesterday's top 10's: $SPX, $DNA, $RHT, $PLS, $FOD, $WHK, $DOW, $AVZ, $SVL, $AMS, and #ELLIOTTWAVE, #TRADING, #GOLD, #LITHIUM, #ASX, #AUSBIZ, #URANIUM, #STOCKS, #FOREX, #DOW
125 2018-12-28 22:45:02 If asset ‘values’ have increased by 50% because central banks and companies themselves have bought stocks, it would seem logical that a 10% drop doesn’t have the same meaning as it would in a marketplace where no such manipulation has taken place. Maybe a 50% drop would make more
126 2018-12-28 22:44:42 @MSNBC well we have seen the swamp swell under @realDonaldTrump and all the @GOP passed was a tax bill so companies can buy back stocks. Where is the 1 trillion from overseas use that money for the wall NO ONE WANTS Gofundme a damn school
127 2018-12-28 22:44:09 @OptionsAction premiums on $SNAP calls are high, how much could short covering push the stocks price?

I really haveto check these sales and make sure my stocks aren't falling...

132 2018-12-28 22:40:36 I moved my wife's equity stocks into a MMA at her brokerage in mid October. She would have lost $19,000, over 10 % if I hadn't.
133 2018-12-28 22:39:33 Right before every recession there is almost always a period of stock market instability. This is because after the initial crash, stockbrokers try to buy cheap - when those stocks don't recover and hold their value, look out

You really shouldn't have banned bump stocks from law abiding citizens.
Meanwhile, no justice has been served to the victims of Benghazi. AND still no wall. But at least you showed all us law abiding citizens!!!!!
135 2018-12-28 22:39:19 My dad against my advice (buy and hold) sold all his stocks some time back otherwise he would have written me out of his will

138 2018-12-28 22:36:32 If we get another great depression, all minimum wage will be gone and most ppl will lose jobs or get pay cut, all 401 and retirement savings will lose half $, after tech stocks crashing, Jimmy will lose YouTube, and Jimmy won't have $ to operate. So don't be silly.
139 2018-12-28 22:36:06 Stocks pretty much even Friday.
140 2018-12-28 22:35:39 I think Bitcoin is thriving, I believe there are less than 10 stocks that trade over $1000 per unit. 3500 per unit is pretty impressive.
141 2018-12-28 22:35:13 I'm buying guillotine stocks...
142 2018-12-28 22:34:47 $TEAM $PLAN and $GH are the stocks I swing trade for quick profits in this volatile reaction bounce. Setups look nice and if the PPT really takes care of things now we could be in for a serious market bounce leading to a couple breakouts in leading speculative names.
143 2018-12-28 22:34:36 Me thinks he’s looking for stocks to short to fund his retirement 
144 2018-12-28 22:34:19 some compare 2018 with 2013 when market entered a bull run after an IMF plan. but stocks must get really cheap first. hard to guess how much market falls. atleast he didnt ask you to buy when market was at 50k

152 2018-12-28 22:33:15 Late 2007 was when the decline started and not the only time it was down from its peak. You had years to make money but you've now exposed yourself as a fearful non-investor who chirps from the sidelines while showing you know nothing about stocks AND real estate.
153 2018-12-28 22:33:08 Just saw that @netflix released the salaries including stocks and bonuses. I get they are in charge but that amount is ridiculous.

159 2018-12-28 22:27:16 Generally agree, but I think it has got a lot better tbf, and our local branch in Reading now stocks a lot of (vg) vinyl. Also you could always get some good bargains. I would be v sad to see it go, as is only remaining shop to sell new records in the town..

People are freaked out with the wild, historic dip, then the wild upswing.

It should freak you out. But don't make a big error, pulling all of your money out when it's (still) down from this years high. Experts say in times of uncertainty...
218 2018-12-28 21:51:03 Seems pretty dim to have an opinion on the market cap of a crypto you last read about months ago.  Even shareholders of stocks get updated every quarter.
219 2018-12-28 21:51:01 That's Quins and Saints who have knocked them over now in the GP. Plus Gloucester beat them in Europe, on their own patch, with front row stocks decimated by injury. Granted it didn't go so well the following week mind.

225 2018-12-28 21:47:41 That's largely true, but you could take it further.

Investing in stocks is a bet on the future of certain segments of the US economy.

I don't know where the proceeds from stock sales went, but, by definition, they were places viewed as better/safer bets than US corporations.
226 2018-12-28 21:46:09 Going to be great watching pension funds load up on stocks at the end of an economic cycle with government debt limiting the ability to mitigate it.
227 2018-12-28 21:43:58 That’s the problem with these guys they are selling picks to people who don’t have a big bankroll so when they send out 10-15 plays they expect you to get down on every play.....a 500 dollar bankroll you’d have to bet so small it’s basically penny stocks lmfao stop buying picks!

229 2018-12-28 21:43:36 Stocks were down to 3% in the USA and a lot of Democrats blamed Trump for it.

259 2018-12-28 21:30:26 With all due respect, u r wrong in the sense, stocks r traded in regulated exchanges, only on working days n for a specific time in any trading day. Cryptocurrencies r traded in unregulated exchanges 24x7x365. There is no Cap in growth or decline per day. #crypto #cryptotrading

265 2018-12-28 21:27:20 Stocks end the week up, after a volatile session
266 2018-12-28 21:27:02 10%, please tell me which company you're investing with? I have been saving and investing since my 20s, 1990s. My funds are no way near 10%, more like 3%, lost and/or cleared even most years, not much gain here! Stocks-investing are for the rich peeps playing in the sandbox!
267 2018-12-28 21:26:46 US stocks are way overvalued
268 2018-12-28 21:26:35 sauf que les russes avaient pas accès à ces stocks, il y avait que l'Etat Fédéral Allemand réunifié (membre de l'OTAN) qui y avait accès , d'où le fait que ce soit des alliées des Américains qui y ont eux accès (les Croates) 
Après ça a due etre revendu un peu partout

276 2018-12-28 21:23:07 $GE, $AMD, $BAC, $F, and $T were the top five most active stocks today.
277 2018-12-28 21:23:00 Timing. Open up a 1 minute chart and see how stocks reacted to Powell's dismissal of QT as unimportant during the last FOMC. Also look at how stocks reacted to Powell in Sept (the exact top). Then do the same on daily charts.

335 2018-12-28 21:02:15 True intrinsic value incalculable, based on future expectations. Think finding mispriced stocks based on what market should be valuing them, identifying market’s own mistakes, not whether market correct via hindsight. Prices only reflect future expectations, not future reality.

340 2018-12-28 21:00:12 All the moves he makes are dodgy looking but he could be getting financial gain from the chaos. Buying when stocks and businesses are at a low point and then recanting, so that stocks and business sales go up. Profit in his madness?????

348 2018-12-28 20:53:00 Specifically stocks only.
349 2018-12-28 20:52:50 There you go - it looks like shorts are responding to you .  Man, this is relentless - AMZN lost $35 in 20 minutes.  When people are not willing to risk holding stocks over a weekend, then it does not send a healthy signal and probably implies they are expecting more downtrend.

359 2018-12-28 20:49:01 Now the trick for a new investor is to figure which stocks are really undervalued when the market goes back up versus other stocks that are also appear undervalued but will not grow as expected for whatever reason  so who knows the true undervalued stocks??? Tell me please 
360 2018-12-28 20:48:59 Mr. February from CNBC (see photo below) also admonishes investors that "when stocks are down 20% you buy stocks." Really? What if you're in the middle of a bear  market like after the tops in 2000 and 2007 and you  headed over 50% lower from there??? Moron Math at its finest...

385 2018-12-28 20:34:21 @jimcramer how about that Powell should be arming the administration and its stand against China?  Powell is missing how important this stand really is for all Americans. This is not just about 401ks, pension plans or stocks for the wealthy but about keeping our economy strong.
386 2018-12-28 20:34:01 My hunch without evidence is that the meds in question being public health meds would have been at Natpharm in the process of being sent out to Natpharm centres, but Natpharm was not able to utilise all the available stocks of meds in question ..../3

389 2018-12-28 20:33:26 Box has great service if ur a customer but avg “service” if ur a shareholder. There is s’thing not right about how the $BOX story is being told to the market which is why the stock is down so much yet an Atlassian has held up so well. It’s not an “all tech stocks are down” thing.
390 2018-12-28 20:33:08 I smell a rat king James! They manipulated or inflated stocks just to make sure that the billionaires got paid! Watch what happens next week or next year! A huge dump is going to happen!

397 2018-12-28 20:30:58 If you pride yourself on picking up undervalued stocks, you likewise need to be able to cope with riding over-valued stocks that the animal spirits have a hold upon. Tough as required 180o flip in your mentality.

399 2018-12-28 20:30:16 Yes. It's bullshit propaganda.  Any pension manager who would buy stocks right now should be fired.  If pensions were chasing returns in any sector, it would be single-B thru triple-B bonds - not that I would advise that either....

504 2018-12-28 19:45:10 I don't.  But the abnormal volatility affects everyone, not just those that own stocks.  People get laid off when a businesses' stock drops and loses value.  I was laid off in 2009 due to the 2008 recession.
505 2018-12-28 19:44:59 Social housing is not an option for the majority of people. Has not been for decades. You may want this to change, but realistically that is not going to happen any time soon. With social housing stocks as they are, we cannot even meet priority needs.
506 2018-12-28 19:44:37 Stocks in 2018 showed me this year, Remain calm & let the dust settle. Not all is gold but if you don’t peak in then you won’t know. Next year will be a big plus as the current president will want to remain in office.

507 2018-12-28 19:44:35 there are a lot of stocks setting up into bullish phases all of a sudden. not hard to find them. for now, the market is trading in a polar opposite fashion as compared to recent down days. $SPY $IWM $QQQ #stocks
508 2018-12-28 19:44:22 The opinion on bump-stocks should be if they are "in common use" and that was used in the Miller, Heller, and Caetano #SCOTUS cases.

In Caetano v MA, stun gun #2A protection was based on 200K used owned by US citizens

In Maloney v Cuomo, it was about 64K for nunchucks.

512 2018-12-28 19:42:56 I'd look for January effect in MJ Stocks, starting early in $ACRGF today. Then use reinflated stock currency for US acquisitions.  $TCNNF might be a good fit.  Revs and Florida dominance.  Before State's Right Act passes and Canopy can start its buying spree.

533 2018-12-28 19:35:30 Good day to sell stocks if you have them, in my opinion.  A lot of people thinking they are getting a bargain after the sell off will be mad when stocks start repositioning for a global economic slowdown

590 2018-12-28 19:14:34 @emcilveen not far from that: trying to sell performance of a $20m fund full of illiquid stocks to raise $100ms. Performance of funds with illiquid stocks can be no little more value than paper portfolio
591 2018-12-28 19:14:21 The best time to invest in stocks, is right around the time in which Trump makes national comments, especially about the financial and industrial sectors.
Just time crank him, wait on the stocks to drop and then voila. Cheap stocks! Joke dis!
592 2018-12-28 19:14:11 Just an FYI that I've been kicked out of the SetYourStop chatroom and blocked by @setyourstop on Twitter. I was told he no longer wants anything to do with weed stocks. A pretty disappointing turn of events, especially after he asked me to encourage all my followers to join.
593 2018-12-28 19:13:47 Not a great argument. The 2017 season boosted both of their stocks, esp Sony after the Rose Bowl game. They wouldn’t have been 1st or 2nd round picks if they left early, especially with the RB depth in the 2017 draft (Fournette, McCaffrey, Cook, Mixon, Kamara, Hunt).

633 2018-12-28 18:56:47 Honestly, you’re not even funny! Try being realistic and look at all the crimes Hillary and Obama have committed! Or are you not open minded? I personally am aware of the kind of person Trump is...but I sure am happy with my stocks and the economy!
634 2018-12-28 18:55:57 It benefits Bitcoin and alts credibility. Bakkt & co. have reputation and reach. If other big names follow suit Bitcoin will be as popular and accessible as major stocks. Newcomers realize it has a dual function, that it can be used as money, and then you have mass adoption

638 2018-12-28 18:54:38 Where are all the people who bought weed stocks on @EasyEquities? How high are the returns now, no pun intended?

Don't buy shit just because someone hyped it.
639 2018-12-28 18:54:31 Stocks are signaling recession scare but that doesn't mean there will be one THERE'S THAT NEW WORD 'SCARE' ALONG WITH THE WORD 'FEAR'. YOU MARKET PEOPLE ARE NUTS AND BAFFLE US EVERYDAY PEOPLE. HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU ROLL OVER TO GET WHERE YOU ARE/
640 2018-12-28 18:54:26 At my gym. Haven’t decided yet to help Dow or not to rally it stocks up.
641 2018-12-28 18:54:06 Well, Ms. Sunday School Teacher,  how many bump stocks do you own?
642 2018-12-28 18:53:43 Usted no entiende nada.......Petro interpreta el trino de Paul Krugman, confundiendo stocks (acciones), con stock(inventario). Cuando menciona la "o" es para traducir inventario, a quien no sabe inglés. Usted está más perdido que el hijo de Lindbergh.........
643 2018-12-28 18:53:37 silver stocks look great!
644 2018-12-28 18:53:16 people are talking about their stocks and money guys and im sitting here thinking about superheroes
645 2018-12-28 18:53:15 Fox changed his mind? What mess did he create? Chaos in the stocks? What chaos? lol
646 2018-12-28 18:53:01 Nope. Didn’t. But as an NRA certified instructor, do you have an opinion on the use of bump stocks? Where does it fall in regards to sporting/hunting/personal defense use? A few friends call it a toy that destroys any semblance of accuracy for defense & wastes ammo.
647 2018-12-28 18:52:45 He should be allowed to place each of his colleagues in the stocks and beat them.
648 2018-12-28 18:52:17 I mostly did large stocks from WIG20, as that was the strongest segment this year. Mostostal was an old failed trade from March 2017
649 2018-12-28 18:51:56 I be trippin when folks be like I’m finna buy a stock in apple or any company that’s successful at the moment  lol like people really don’t understand stocks 
650 2018-12-28 18:51:31 But that's why the case for stocks in the early 1980s was so good. If inflation stayed high you didn't have any more P/E compression. All surprises from those valuations were positive surprises. Opposite here.
651 2018-12-28 18:51:10 Of course. Aunty Jayne has a plentiful supply of alcohol. @WGAbroad has obviously run her stocks down being at home for Xmas!
652 2018-12-28 18:50:57 Ready to shut it down. Trading profits funded 2nd A purchases this year. Lots of good dividend stocks out there. #gunsvsbutter
653 2018-12-28 18:50:22 When is Commerzbank or Deutsch or one of the others going to fail. Their stocks are plummeting... They are all dirty and I'm sure each have a black hold in their basement. Are they not getting a tad undercapitalized?
654 2018-12-28 18:48:43 I just pay attention to brands...I follow stocks so I’m always interested in what brands and companies are doing

656 2018-12-28 18:47:56 Zerohedge has a problem with hyperbole sometimes. So what they call a dump may not be such a big deal. I'm looking a the chart for 10Y yields Dec 26 and 27 when the #PPT pumped stocks and I see yields LOWER on as of close yest. 2.74% yest, 2.75% close Dec 24. C'mon!
657 2018-12-28 18:47:42 Investments,Insurance, stocks, he saved his money!
658 2018-12-28 18:47:34 my hair when its well taken care of looks like i just arrived to a business meeting to tell you that the stocks are going down
659 2018-12-28 18:47:31 Tonight, Carlsburg Bottles only £1 and Blue Moon Bottles only £1.50 while stocks last  as well as our normal deals and some great music 
660 2018-12-28 18:46:44 Haha, there are so many creative ways to do it too: (1) You’re doing awfully well, (friend). (2) Those 3 stocks though! (3) If this were a team match, I’d press the button to steal one of (friend’s) stocks. (4) I’m doing well this match, at this rate I’ll get SECOND place .
661 2018-12-28 18:46:06 It was announced that this is the worst month for stocks since the great depression... Great job Trumplethinskin for MAGA
662 2018-12-28 18:45:07 All Major Gains are Wiped Out for the Year As Stocks Crash for the Worst Dec. Since 1931
663 2018-12-28 18:45:06 stocks are way more easy to analyze than forex
664 2018-12-28 18:44:55 At midday, Mortgage Bonds are holding gains. Stocks near unchanged. 10-yr yield 2.72%.
665 2018-12-28 18:44:41 We will find out next month when the fed continues with its b/s reduction after the December pause.  Yields should jump causing stocks to drop.
666 2018-12-28 18:44:31 The spokesperson directly told me she won't vote for politicians based she believes are too anti-gun so that doesn't seem to be the case. Besides, President Trump literally just unilaterally banned bump stocks and lots of gun owners voted for him.
667 2018-12-28 18:44:24 @yasminv @MSNBC @MichaelRStrain YASMIN. HE'S WHAT? It takes 5 to 7 years for the economy to show improvement and you think Trump did it? Jesus!The clown who destroyed Harley D,coal, farmers, tariffs, STOCKS, etc is responsible for (maybe) a good economy?No, honey, that was Obama!
668 2018-12-28 18:44:16 Where should a person making over 250k a year with no children dependents, living solely with his wife that also has an income place their $?

670 2018-12-28 18:43:42 I was wondering if T+2 had any relation to the past two days and, if so, aren't we done with the "I forgot to buy stocks" entities?
671 2018-12-28 18:43:29 Quelqu’un connaît les jours/heures des remises en stocks d’Asos ?
672 2018-12-28 18:43:27 Low interest rates for the last decade hurt the average retired person, forcing more speculation and investment in stocks. Most of these investors were getting pushed into stocks at the end of cycle, not beginning, which will create another painful ending.
673 2018-12-28 18:43:06 Hello,

I regret to advise you that we do not have any more of the Christmas Oliver Bear in stock. Every year we receive limited stocks for our Christmas Bear and this year we started to sell this bear in July.

Happy New Year!

675 2018-12-28 18:41:56 Tax loss selling, they been saying that. So the next two months will be slow, unless they swap for similar stocks.
676 2018-12-28 18:41:54 It seems problematic that shorting stocks is so cheap. Amenable to manipulation. I had thought it was much more expensive after watching The Big Short (I’m no expert, okay ).
677 2018-12-28 18:41:26 But neg interest rates just alter portfolio decisions/mix, so prices of variable-priced (non-"money") instruments adjust. Stocks, bonds, real estate.

Hot potato causing *spending* makes no sense IMO. "My assets have a negative yield. I'd better spend them!"
678 2018-12-28 18:41:24 Hey I’m a reporter with CTV News...looking for people with Aphria stocks. Do you have any? Would you want to chat with us to give us your reaction?
679 2018-12-28 18:41:09 Good I parked my stocks months ago because of all the stench coming from Trump anus. 401k’s will tank if he follows through.

684 2018-12-28 18:39:28 No doubt sov debt facing more challenged funding as global growth slows. But not sure it is any more complicated than pension managers viewing probability of hedging growth in their liabilities using bonds = 0 while > 0 with stocks.
685 2018-12-28 18:36:28 1/2 Bitcoin was designed to be a currency, with traits of commodities and stocks mixed in. It's more like a stock right now,  but as it matures it can be more like gold, with the added ability of easy transfer of ownership, logically leading to use in commerce.
686 2018-12-28 18:36:05 Makes sense. Especially smaller/micro stocks. PM’s don’t want to explain those positions to higher ups.  Great call!!  Thanks.
687 2018-12-28 18:35:58 @tim_cook stocks dropped because China refused to buy soybeans from my Pennsylvania. China’s decision is hurting my Pennsylvania farmers. It is simple. Please follow my tweets. (Don’t call @KimReynoldsIA and @IvankaTrump. They don’t know much. Both are still students .)

Tobacco is one of the few consumer products which, if used as designed, will kill the consumer. I know...I used to be a respiratory therapist and took care of lots of dying tobacco victims.
Making money by killing people is wrong.

701 2018-12-28 18:31:33 Ressources stocks start moving
702 2018-12-28 18:30:59 There are 3 simple rules to follow in stock market investing: invest in stocks according to your personal risk tolerance, diversify globally, and rebalance.
703 2018-12-28 18:30:52 Yup. Watching it play out in Venezuela right now. Prices in bolivares, stocks and real estate are at record highs.
704 2018-12-28 18:30:51 You agreed to a clean CR. You assured McConnell. It passed unanimously with a voice vote. Then Fox changed your mind.  You created this mess!  Wear the mantle.  Have you seen the chaos in stocks?  You are the author of chaos!  Trade wars and Mattis!   the insanity!
705 2018-12-28 18:30:42 How embarrassing, for both of you. As if cash were sent over with a trade deficit. It's financial assets: stocks, bonds, etc. Those do not presuppose cash (although that facilitates it a lot): You can have a share in a company in a barter economy or borrow capital with interest.
706 2018-12-28 18:29:41 Don't worry the NRA will save us...oh wait they just helped ban bump stocks
707 2018-12-28 18:29:40 Why don't you disclose if you hold a position on any of the stocks mentioned in LR etc, AND, the companies you have that come on the show?
708 2018-12-28 18:28:27 $UBQU: 0.0008 x 0.0009, added more here ... 1 more trading day, then we're off to the 2019, the year for HEMP stocks to fly high!

712 2018-12-28 18:27:13 But then came the 2000 - 2003 crash and "Tech Wreck" which vindicated MPT style AA, so the wirehouses started using it. After that, it became well known and widely used. The trouble is, its volatility targeting has since overweighted stocks at low vol peaks, underweights lows...
713 2018-12-28 18:27:00 I would think those kinds of assumptions are implicit in any investment decision, just as investors in the early 1980s probably thought double digit inflation would persist, thus making stocks not worth more than single-digit P/Es.
714 2018-12-28 18:26:42 Lots of sale items in store now  while stocks last..
715 2018-12-28 18:26:13 When stocks rally, Eurodollars go offered, front end bonds hardly move down at all.  When stocks break, we are very quick to go bid across fixed income
716 2018-12-28 18:24:46 "The goal of the anti-gun left is, ultimately, not just banning bump stocks, but, rather, putting 'points on the board' toward its goal of banning civilian ownership of all firearms."

Do they realize that it was Trump’s REPUBLICAN Administration that passed/signed the change? 
717 2018-12-28 18:24:15 Another memory from late '90s were the CFP-type early adapters of MPT typically used a 1-year lookback standard deviation in their MV optimizer. Rising V drove lower exposure to stocks as momentum increased. By the 2000 peak, they struggled from low % in stocks with the momentum
718 2018-12-28 18:23:50 If you buy foreign stocks you'll notice that the tend to pay higher dividends. If you buy foreign stocks you'll decrease the trade deficit. So you can do something about it.

730 2018-12-28 18:19:01 Bayo was one of the few who could take advantage of Lylat in that way. Many other projectiles were less effective.

WW - well, I imagine people will reconsider after y'all take stocks at 5%.
731 2018-12-28 18:18:24 Why?

Bump stocks are stupid and drastically reduce accuracy. Your much better off with a semi-automatic and some trigger discipline.
732 2018-12-28 18:17:23 Dividends key part of my IRA growth. Not taxed until you take it out of IRA, then taxed at your ordinary rate. But, stocks held outside retirement account, the dividends can be nice income. Plus, when stock or real estate is inherited basis goes to value at death. ZERO taxes.

735 2018-12-28 18:15:44 If you want to change the trade balance buy assets (stocks,bonds real-estate etc.) outside the USA. The imbalance is mostly due to foreigners buying more USA assets that USAers buy outside the USA.
736 2018-12-28 18:15:38 Boeing does have existing contracts. I'm wondering if he divested all his stocks, highly doubt he put his assets in a blind trust. More self-dealing might be occurring.
737 2018-12-28 18:14:48 The current uncertainty hasn’t helped and some of his policies have undoubtedly hurt stocks while others have artificially helped stocks (tax cuts).  Economy (as opposed to stock market) is still pretty healthy though slowing.  But this business cycle is living on borrowed time.
738 2018-12-28 18:14:30 Not a Trump fan and I'm for full repeal of the 2A, but, bump stocks are now banned. Take minor gains when they happen.

741 2018-12-28 18:13:48 WDAY, CRM and NOW have all ripped 15-20 points off their lows.  All have clear path to ATH's.  Seems Druckenmiller is right and these cloud stocks will be leaders.  Cybersecurity names especially CYBR look strong too.
742 2018-12-28 18:13:40 Mediocre day for stocks as of now -- I would prefer we close around here and not have another last second jump. I think that would set us up to start next week stronger #investing #StockMarket #StockMarketNews
743 2018-12-28 18:13:32 Watching #CNBC and they break a story that someone in the #whitehouse called a “large hedge fund manager” ON CHRISTMAS EVE during sell off specifically to ask what they need to do “get stocks to go up”?! Is this a fucking joke?  There is no winning in this system @QTRResearch
744 2018-12-28 18:11:27 Dow Drops 300 From Overnight Highs, Bonds & Bitcoin Bid
 
Is it time for stocks to catch back down to bonds?
745 2018-12-28 18:10:38 Also re: Commodities vs Stocks, it may simply be that stocks tank and commodities drop less. If you look at the rallies in the chart, they are 1930s (deflation), early 1990s, 2008. I suspect that the chart is just "keeping it real" (bad econ pun)
746 2018-12-28 18:08:29 January should be a fun and profitable month with beat ups stocks bouncing and new leaders emerging. That said putting a list of top stocks for 2019 together to be released no later than January 1st for our members.
747 2018-12-28 18:08:19 Outlawing bump stocks? Which of these things was unwise, and why?
748 2018-12-28 18:08:06 Mortgage Bonds are modestly higher as Stocks trade near unchanged after two days of gains. Have a beautiful weekend! #bonds #stocks #everestupdate
749 2018-12-28 18:08:05 Ive told over 20 individuals in 2018 not to play with stocks because a Bear Market was coming. Its not over yet either. Their trying to renew confidence so people buy stocks now its low, but its a trick.  The calm before the storm. Worst is yet to come. Trust that!!!
750 2018-12-28 18:08:03 I mean, Trump banned bump stocks, but I'm not worshiping him. I'm glad Sanders has done some things for other places, but so has everyone else in the game. Besides Ted Cruz and Mike Pence probably.

755 2018-12-28 18:06:59 Low volume stocks can be easily manipulated by operators. Plz keep in mind operators have access of market depth upto 20 price and public have only 5. You come with big money they watch you. When there is high volume there is no risk.
756 2018-12-28 18:06:49 Yesterday, my stocks were down, today they went up. 
757 2018-12-28 18:06:48 I agree with your Amazon assessment I worked at Amazon for 3 years when I left I was making 14.50 but your second check you have a chance for a production bonus which wasn't bad but they took that away also the stocks when you start working you can cash in after 2 years not anymo

762 2018-12-28 18:05:11 @jimcramer is there going to be a record breaking retail earnings this January’19, some stocks go up at least 10% from current level(S&P 500 - 2490) in January, Oil going to go up at least 10% because of supply cuts? IMO, the rally may be short lived because of politics.Thoughts?

764 2018-12-28 18:04:16 There are some stocks that you should avoid as much as possible because they make too big candles like a thunderbolt that is harmful for a decent trader. IBUlhsgfin, Apollotyres, TVSmotor, UPL, Concor, Apollohosp, Centurytex, etc etc you can find many by research

778 2018-12-28 17:58:04 Why are pension funds rotating into stocks in such scale when 10 year expected returns based on hysterically over inflated earnings expectations are -5+% or worse?

Are these people crazy or do they not just not understand what is going on?
779 2018-12-28 17:57:53 Well, it's price/earnings for the economy as a whole, but I won't debate the point if you prefer CAPE. IMO CAPE is better but the point is they both show stocks are still egregiously overvalued vs historical norms.

790 2018-12-28 17:52:27 The ban on bump stocks doesn't really change anything when you can achieve the same effect with your belt loop (that's a fact). That's why I don't understand the whining aside from wanting to spread the irrational "they're coming for your guns" fear.

798 2018-12-28 17:50:01 The 10 year us bond at 2.75 the institutions are now going back to stocks can we retest the lows yes net inflows are showing as of this week.
799 2018-12-28 17:49:37 How would this change if we assume stocks tend to trend rather than random walk? Like a weighted coin, if last move was + then next is 55% likely to also be +, something like that (5% trendiness). Each stock might have a different “trendiness”. Random walk is 0 trendiness.
800 2018-12-28 17:49:32 If trump had any credibility left, stocks would have plummeted today on his threat of shutting down the southern border. He’s a joke.

807 2018-12-28 17:47:57 How the other half live. For us working claas types, books are tree presents, not stocking fillers. Stocking fillers are stocks, deodorant, some form of fruit and/or nuts and one of those wheels of jelly orange and lemon. Good book though.
808 2018-12-28 17:47:50 I’ve bought some stocks right before Buffett made huge headlines with his stake. I don’t see a ton of value in a stock just because another billionaire invests. What matters in long run is performance. Berkowitz was huge backer of lampert & on sears board. How’d that workout?
809 2018-12-28 17:47:44 Cryptocurrencies are not like stocks, they don't have the luxury of central banks bailing them out whenever they go through a dip.

878 2018-12-28 17:26:10 $GE, $AMAT, $COTY, $CMG, and $NVDA are the top five stocks higher at noon today.
879 2018-12-28 17:26:05 gold has a huge target over next 7/8 years, but if you are not going to book profits in gold stocks now & then  , then the whole exercise will not be worth it. IMO all gold stocks investors should be good chartists or have assistance in this regard.
880 2018-12-28 17:25:54 #OneLuckyGuy, Tyrus on #outnumbered, my man, you play the stocks. Great. I just hope you're not taking advice from Capitalist Pig or @JessicaTarlov. Funny how she blames .@POTUS when the Stocks drop, but credits Obama when they rise. She's the REAL HYPOCRITE.

884 2018-12-28 17:24:03 It literally does brah lmao once you learn about stocks, investing, credit, loans, etc. you have more power to make better financial decisions and it's not judging it's calling out bad financial/spending habits.
885 2018-12-28 17:23:19 I think the Stock Market has been playing US. It's volatile because the shadow government wants to buy stocks at rock bottom prices and then do just what the "tax break" did, slurp up all the money possible before they break the bank again. You are being PLAYED by money mongers.
886 2018-12-28 17:23:03 We just learned that "a high-ranking Trump administration official reached out to at least one  well known investor for advice on markets after a recent drubbing for  stocks, sources told CNBC." 1/2
887 2018-12-28 17:22:54 No one is coming to take yr guns.  But given the political profile of the NRA, I worry much more abt gun rights activists using their weapons to enforce tyranny than I do abt not being able to fight it if we have intensive background checks and bans on bump stocks.
888 2018-12-28 17:22:19 @R3HAB too much risk on options friend.only stocks for now :)
889 2018-12-28 17:22:11 Hmmm Stock goes up up up 10 years in a row -  It great, its different this time, stock valuations are justified. 
Stocks drop 3 months in a row:  Yikes blame the algorithmic and Fed :) because nobody on Wall St. has ever manipulated markets. Why would they? :)

890 2018-12-28 17:21:44 Bond yields were suppressed until last year. If bonds are making 5% again the stock market risk premium requires stocks fall a lot from here, S&P 500 at ~2000 (going with the long-run correlation of 1 billion in corporate profits = 1pt in the indexj

892 2018-12-28 17:21:35 Not really; the powers that be have made it a rule that stocks cannot lose money except temporarily; when it does, they intervene and get prices back up.

895 2018-12-28 17:21:10 Seriously, for stocks no statistics, I don't care of volatility or ranges when I pick them. Oddly sentiment / psychology are not on my radar but I think they are implied in TA so...
896 2018-12-28 17:20:33 For the guys who follow and trust me : 2019 will sure shot give big profits to gold and silver mining stocks investors, but timing the run is not possible. The upsides will come in a matter of weeks. Only for this reason, I am fully invested in this space with all the downsides.
897 2018-12-28 17:20:23 No thank you. Stocks will do me just fine.
898 2018-12-28 17:20:21 Haha! You're really behind in the news, aren't you?

902 2018-12-28 17:19:29 Make sure you are on the other side when you close it. Might help stocks. We like it when you leave
903 2018-12-28 17:19:27 Trump goes leaves the country stock market goes up. He comes back it goes down. Starting to see a pattern here.  Let's try and experiment  and send him over seas again and see if stocks rise. Maybe Russia will take him.

906 2018-12-28 17:18:55 Trump called a well known fund manager and asked what he had to do for stocks to go up. His answer was:
1) stop twitting 
2) Close a deal with China 
3) stop threatening the Fed
The guy is amateur hour

910 2018-12-28 17:17:16 4) Net cap gains + Taxable IRA distributions = ~200% of annual PCE growth.  Add in options & restricted stock & it's easily 225-250% of annual PCE growth.  

This means that PCE (65% of US economy, & therefore US tax receipts) will be hard-pressed to grow unless stocks grow.

916 2018-12-28 17:16:37 Sell stocks
917 2018-12-28 17:16:37 So basically the stock market went up, then down, then up again. 

So other than Trump being President, this is a normal year in stocks. But since Trump IS President, it was a disaster of a year in stocks.

Right.

920 2018-12-28 17:15:52 1) "Father said that everything that comes after 'but' is bullsh*t." -Jon Snow, GoT.

2) The 3 Fed chairpeople since 1995 all said explicitly or implicitly that policies to drive stocks up were the goal.

3) The absolute amounts involved support the conclusion, chart porn or not.
921 2018-12-28 17:15:50 It's like stocks.

I think his short $XEG call "today" is very risky.

990 2018-12-28 16:49:00 Embrasement,c’est certain. J’ai appris hier en parlant avec des amis kurdes anti erdogan et anti musulmans que les us avaient vendu aux kurdes des stocks d’armes avant de partir, ce qui a rendu erdogan fou de rage. Les kurdes se préfèrent armés que soit disant protégés par les us
991 2018-12-28 16:48:52 i need to get into stocks but i don’t know shit about them.
992 2018-12-28 16:48:52 trump’s a horrible business man. There are literally tons of reports on how he killed the XFL, how if he had invested his inheritance in poor performing stocks, he’d be worth 5 times what he is, etc. Why do his supporters insist that others do a simple google search for them?

995 2018-12-28 16:47:46 Pero Manuel, con ese argumento, cualquier impuesto, con cualquier alícuota, eventualmente "se queda con todo". Porque estás omitiendo en tu análisis que esa casa (y cualquier otro activo) genera ingresos. Es engañoso mezclar flujos con stocks y no contar todos los flujos.
996 2018-12-28 16:46:22 That will be great for the stock market and individual stocks.   Ever time something good happens, you go out of your way to destroy it.   The market jumped up, so you tweet a boneheaded brain fart and try to bring it down.

999 2018-12-28 16:45:15 Add global stocks and global indices, with a long/short strategy you'll always have something that's trending, up or down. 

Long only strategies will be heckled in a bear market. Just as short only are killed in a bull market. And it's okay to play one side.

1054 2018-12-30 23:42:00 Beg to differ on the "no results" POV. Have you seen the list of indictments, property seizure, sentencings, flipping of "former best people?" Mueller, et al. have yielded more return investment than stocks on the DOW!

1058 2018-12-30 23:39:27 @DOJPH Acting AG Whitaker banned bump stocks, not Congress. @NRA will sue to have it overturned.

1062 2018-12-30 23:34:54 AR-15’s being converted is illegal, and bumps stocks ruin guns. Let’s not forget that murder is illegal. Stop with the attempt to denying people their right to bear arms.
1063 2018-12-30 23:34:53 Banning one style of gun (assault style), or bump stocks, and even enacting common sense gun laws, are a far cry from "taking all our guns".

Which goes back to my original point of how so many on the right respond to ANY conversation about guns by peddling fear and conspiracies
1064 2018-12-30 23:34:43 Cold kills people yet all the Mets root for cold "encouraging". So do you secretly own funeral home stocks?

1067 2018-12-30 23:33:23 And how does it look for the last 2 years?  You do know 401k is a long term investment for retirement, right?  And, you do know stocks historically rise and fall, right?   Next!
1068 2018-12-30 23:32:37 The Communist Left Democrat party knows what's best for the women of America?

1069 2018-12-30 23:28:13 Stocks fizzing and frothing. Big companies are busily buying back their own stock from the massive tax cuts from Trump. So it would be fair to say that the mythical “trickle down” economy is just that. 
A myth!
No new jobs and no reinvestment.
1070 2018-12-30 23:26:05 In the UK, homes are often repossessed as collateral. As is savings, stocks, shares etc. That includes vehicles over a certain value, if you have more than one car, or if on lease. They often reposses high value, non essential goods. They can tax up to 70% of income from source.
1071 2018-12-30 23:23:54 Ok, but AR15’s can be converted and bump stocks sure do the job. Remember Las Vegas? In fact it was very easy for me to find them online.
1072 2018-12-30 23:17:15 The takes on Oilers Twitter, I’m buying stocks in glue products.
1073 2018-12-30 23:16:57 Manny, lives on Saddleridge Drive with lots of dogs.

1082 2018-12-30 23:09:36 Agreed, I think parrying is going to be really important in the MU long-term to be able to effectively seal stocks
1083 2018-12-30 23:05:40 No need to rush, army made really huge stocks at the border, and of course hundreds of tanks, artillery, APCs is not just for show, now the diplomatic talks are going on.they might start in the coming week i guess
1084 2018-12-30 23:05:01 I've had to go grab some Smash 4 footage for a new video, and my god...it really does look like it's in slow motion, and 2 stocks seems deeply, deeply wrong :P
1085 2018-12-30 23:04:54 If implementing effective, reasonable gun controls, including banning assault rifles, bump stocks & high-capacity magazines, saves one person from gun violence, it's worth it.
Saving 40,000 people who died from gun violence this year? Even better.
1086 2018-12-30 23:04:34 As you watched MLS stocks rise and fall in the ‘18 FC Cincinnati team, RR seemed as safe a bet as anyone until the June injury @ TFCII. Had appeared in every league match to that point.

Remarkably, after several injury setbacks, he started @ Nashville to close reg season.

1090 2018-12-30 22:59:37 Looking at who profits from CoreCivic & Geo Group stocks makes one realize illegal immigrants are making a lot of money for lots of banks & companies. California teachers union & California Public Employees Retirement, I doubt those retirees realize their funds are part of this.
1091 2018-12-30 22:59:28 Trump just banned bump stocks, so there's that small point...

What if Trump taxed gun manufacturers to the point where guns were so ridiculously expensive only the ridiculously rich could afford? Fine with that?
1092 2018-12-30 22:58:53 I lost to a cpu and my brother said that he could beat it with bowser jr. and he bailed after losing 2 stocks. I then proceeded to take 2 stocks off the cpu with bowser jr. I don’t even play bowser jr lol.
1093 2018-12-30 22:58:43 Barring a credit crisis, I think bonds, like stocks, will be range-bound for a while. Declining liquidity in bonds will likely trigger the next crisis, but who knows when.
1094 2018-12-30 22:58:37 my point is many people invest in the stock market via etf's like SPY which own ALL stocks of the largest 500 companies in the US (Wells is one of those).  If you're counting that kind of ownership of Wells, it's very misleading.  If they own the actual stock, that's a problem.
1095 2018-12-30 22:56:34 I put synthetic stocks on after @Johnnythebouy ran over the wood with Chris’s trike... @czarofbar
1096 2018-12-30 22:56:21 I mean, the discussion wasn't about L2. Out of curiosity though, have you traded with the active trader feature? It's another way to look at L2, makes it ridiculously easy to get absolutely perfect fills on mid-high liquidity stocks.
1097 2018-12-30 22:56:04 I don’t even remember what 2 stocks feels like
1098 2018-12-30 22:55:49 do these people own actual shares or do they own etf's or mutual funds which own dozens, maybe hundreds, of stocks, one of which might be Wells?
1099 2018-12-30 22:54:29 how do u trade stocks is there a website or something?

1105 2018-12-30 22:49:44 And when I got out of stocks a year ago, people told me you shouldn't do that, you can't time the market. Well these are not normal times. I could see trump's behavior was gonna cause all sorts of volatility. I just don't have the stomach for it.

1109 2018-12-30 22:47:29 150% threshold is only for volatile assets like ETH. if we can get traditional assets (e.g. stocks, bonds, real estate) represented on-chain, then we can offer much lower collateral ratios
1110 2018-12-30 22:47:25 I’m about to get rich off of them tire stocks  don’t worry I will let you know the scoop 
1111 2018-12-30 22:44:24 China's CSI 300 set to end the year down ~25%. China stocks down ~$2.3 trillion in value
1112 2018-12-30 22:44:21 SPIKER COMBINE stocks rallying
1113 2018-12-30 22:43:38 @ktown4u why do you keep changing the expected date of stocks? first, it's 12/12 then 12/28 and now it's 01/31.
1114 2018-12-30 22:42:43 $371 bn int. pd. on Federal Debts, the Defense Department budget $599 bn Social Security benefits cost $977 bn, Medicare $585 bn and Medicaid $389 bn.Stocks signale recession scare. Increase of interest ,Bankruptcy of Sears,Kmart ,many follow ,Amazon is active,THIS IS RECESSION!
1115 2018-12-30 22:39:57 @trigmaticrocks  You need to resume work..  Quality but limited stocks.. We need more,  the remix has been on repeat through out after release at late afternoon. Mehn!!! This is music, it touches the soul.
1116 2018-12-30 22:36:13 Yes, until rates hit 2.25-ish%, with a 10-year Bull Market and guaranteed 3%-cd"s, why play stocks to the same degree as before?

Plus, a CEO of the USA who is crude, crass and better suited to be a reality tv Jerry Springer show  host?
1117 2018-12-30 22:35:49 Whats the price on yearbooks these days ? They go up and down like stocks?
1118 2018-12-30 22:35:40 You don't need a CEO to sell stocks, maybe a representative, but no a CEO. The Workers in a company can decide policy and when to buy and sell.
1119 2018-12-30 22:35:02 We need the wall!! NOW!!! The economy is up!!! Stocks are up!!! Unemployment is low!!! Thanks to our President!!! And now he needs our help and build a wall for OUR SAFTY!!! Christmas spending hasn't been higher since. Thank you Mr. Trump!! I'm proud to be an AMERICAN!!
1120 2018-12-30 22:31:35 Thanks Simon for your update, it makes great reading.  Your returns are top notch .  Timing seems to have been key for you. I’m not currently holding any of your 28 stocks which may explain something 
Wishing you a bountiful 2019.
1121 2018-12-30 22:29:58 Trump put in special provision for coast guard. They won't be missing any pay.
1122 2018-12-30 22:29:34 Cool story!
1123 2018-12-30 22:28:52 Dont waste your time with this Troll Utsava. He is a small minded twit who has no idea how operations like this work. All the attacks and weird occurrences the past few days have all been random coincidences right! LOL 
1124 2018-12-30 22:28:44 This was from a few days ago.
1125 2018-12-30 22:27:47 The church takes in $2B tax-free dollars *annually*, has ~$32B in stocks, vast real estate holdings, USA's largest cattle ranch and more, $10M is a disgrace.

That's $1:$200,000,000 based on tithing alone. 0.0000005% charity. I believe they ask 200,000x as much from members, no?
1126 2018-12-30 22:25:10 U would not announce it until the operations are completely done to avoid the hysteria and possible riots etc until AFTER Trumps speech Jan 1st. If you were expecting attack choppers and swat teams with explosions and hollywood bs SORRY doesnt work like that. Swift silent precise
1127 2018-12-30 22:24:57 If you’re selling individual stocks based on earnings and real numbers you’re right. I mean for the people selling ETFs and index funds. 

Overall if you bought and held since Obama was elected your money has doubled
1128 2018-12-30 22:23:16 Hmm, let’s see:
- universal background checks
- ban assault weapons
- raise minimum age to buy rifles
- red flag laws for domestic abusers
To name a few. Banning bump stocks was on my list, so I’m glad we can check that one off.
1129 2018-12-30 22:21:43 What are your favorite “conservative” actions President Bone Spurs has taken:
- Higher tariffs
- Subsidies to farmers
- Ballooning the federal deficit AND the national debt
- Signing off on continued funding of Planned Parenthood
- Baning Bump Stocks
- Cozying up to Russia & NK?
1130 2018-12-30 22:21:08 I can’t sleep through rage most nights. They should all be horse whipped and put in stocks.
1131 2018-12-30 22:20:06 Damn dude why did you have tell them, I was going to buy a ton of depend stocks come Monday. Now you've
 spoiled it for me. I guess I will have change to some eugenics stocks as it seems Nancy is doing so well on it. She had so much balls now, you have wonder where she puts it.
1132 2018-12-30 22:16:37 Yes, I am bullish in the long run on $TSLA and selling calls is a short, but you can do both. I often hold stocks and at the same time sell short-term (covered) calls on those shares. If you set it up correctly you can sell calls on the same shares over and over (weekly).
1133 2018-12-30 22:15:49 Any type of investing its potential money outside of a 9-5 ... options refers to option contracts on stocks which can be traded like stocks check youtube for some tutorials to get you acclimated with them
1134 2018-12-30 22:15:25 Before budget these stocks run every year what is new .... Market is always optimist
1135 2018-12-30 22:15:08 So one way people who don’t invest in stocks or funds are going to get a return is interest on their money in the bank. That hasn’t really happened since recession. If interest rates don’t get raised they’ll never get a return on savings. I think many forgot that’s a thing!
1136 2018-12-30 22:14:34 No, no, no, no, no, stop him! He could chat about stocks!
1137 2018-12-30 22:14:10 Fairly good except when stocks dropped.
1138 2018-12-30 22:13:02 Stocks plunged as CenterPoint Energy, Inc. unveiled a stoic wedding ring today.
1139 2018-12-30 22:12:42 There's a certain element of real corruption or the appearance of impropriety when Congressional members are allowed to own stocks while claiming to represent and serve the ppl. In the balance there's securing their children's future & the best interest of the people. #YouChoose
1140 2018-12-30 22:11:40 Yea i swing trade for the most part but we focus on options not stocks although i do give stock plays as well
1141 2018-12-30 22:11:08 You made 0 progress, noone uses bump stocks.
1142 2018-12-30 22:10:43 Not all there are oil stocks but they were at one time decent

All companies eventually lose their edge for many different reasons and finally die - dividend investing works but it’s no different than any buy and hold, must be tended to regularly
1143 2018-12-30 22:10:41 Serious? "Investment vehicle" like stocks and bonds?

Are did you mean to talk about investments in transportation?
1144 2018-12-30 22:08:36 I DO NOT want to trade up for a QB, with a already weak class, Haskins Murray , Lock’s stocks will inflate. Idc idc idc do not trade up
1145 2018-12-30 22:07:27 Could buy stocks and shares and became business owners. And the right to buy meant working class people could buy houses, so yes she did the most for working class people.   It’s a political fact.
1146 2018-12-30 22:07:12 They might have been good on your list, but most of those guys were on my "do not touch list" for several years already. Never been a fan of oil stocks.
1147 2018-12-30 22:05:24 Trying to sell your poor performing stocks is the hardest  thing I have found to do. It always take longer than you want
1148 2018-12-30 22:04:39 A tad slower and you’ll lose all your bump stocks into that lake. Careful, now!
1149 2018-12-30 22:04:08 We must work together to achieve great things in the New Year and that means putting aside our differences and working for the greater good, which collectively helps everyone #beone #team #achieve #dream #2019 #stocks
1150 2018-12-30 22:01:58 He just whiffed on a block. But I am glad. You might be able to offload your Kevin White stocks.
1151 2018-12-30 22:01:14 Send him some schmaltz when he is in prison.  I doubt the prison stocks lubricants.
1152 2018-12-30 22:01:07 You have your handlers write this shit....you have 0 chance to win the Presidential primary, stick with fixing CA shit, it, and WA are laughing stocks. Can't go under water soon enough...

If you could put 10k into 1 ETF and had to leave it in for the entire 2019 calendar year, which would it be 
1154 2018-12-30 22:00:27 bullish or bearish for stocks
1155 2018-12-30 21:59:17 There’s many formulas & many factors in those formulas. Trump was on fence to keep Yellen. She did a great job. He is nowhere near qualified to even understand what they do & why. He’s a child who just wants his toy. He is violating protocol just talking about stocks & the fed.
1156 2018-12-30 21:56:25 A friend of mine, who some years ago worked selling stocks and bonds for a short period of time, told me that all of the 6 figure earners were the biggest liars in the room! Period, end of story.
1157 2018-12-30 21:53:50 It would be cool if stocks had subtitles to make them intelligible.
1158 2018-12-30 21:51:37 Did you/ are you taking an index short position? Or just sticking to individual stocks?
1159 2018-12-30 21:51:33 Birkin bags are actually a better investment than stocks or gold.

Kind regards

1165 2018-12-30 21:43:21 Just received my personalized IN DEPTH investment portfolio recommendation from @morenitomarcus. Excellent work! It’s user friendly and visually appealing. If you want to jump into the market, but don’t know which stocks/ETFs to choose, let him do the heavy lifting for you.

1169 2018-12-30 21:38:58 Monday,  if decline ,may be  a nice buying chance,, big  move , big range day this week,,,close above 2520 needed  ,,,,Dr  Death, aka fed Jerome Powell speaks on  Fri ,,,, also  jobs report  out Fri  ,,, Pot stocks the stars  of 2019
1170 2018-12-30 21:38:07 Elaborate way around bump stocks...
1171 2018-12-30 21:37:56 These things are currently decimating 1000’s of lakes fish stocks and ground nesting birds as well as garden center and garden ponds. The reintroduction has become out of control. #otter #predation #isreal
1172 2018-12-30 21:35:16 Does that include Bump Stocks?
1173 2018-12-30 21:34:58 That doesn’t mean anything. Remember in 2008 the P/E ratios of $BAC $C $AIG all hit 10 year lows and then within 12 months all three stocks plunged more than 90%
1174 2018-12-30 21:33:19 @Frases_RCampos, vc tem sugestões de outros livros? Li ou estou para ler os livros abaixo:
- Stocks for the Long Run;

1175 2018-12-30 21:31:29 $JD $BABA Trump optimism on China deal may give boost to JD and BABA stocks tomorrow... And JD may go up since it is already under lower...Very interesting to watch
1176 2018-12-30 21:31:23 Remember to buy a basket of these stocks 15-30 I would recommend. Some will fail badly. But you will probably beat the market over the long term with such a strategy, because you take advantage of peoples biases, by being mechanical in your approach
1177 2018-12-30 21:30:59 Fun bit of history: If you go back and watch the 2016 election coverage, just as it begins to become apparent that Trump will win, the after hours trading went nuts with stocks dropping all over. That is, except for private prison firms. Those stocks shot up like a rocket.
1178 2018-12-30 21:30:48 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
1179 2018-12-30 21:30:12 Keep hope alive.  Too bad the stocks rebounded huh?  Lol
1180 2018-12-30 21:28:39 Expecting lots of small cups to form on daily chart of stocks that trended well on 12/26 and closed near their high. Pivot near that high. Success of those cups is the next market decision. $spy
1181 2018-12-30 21:28:15 No analysis, really, just simply trying to be positioned appropriately based on either oversold conditions, price support, or MA breakouts/support with the longer timeframe in mind. Only two individual stocks for now until market improves.
1182 2018-12-30 21:27:38 My mom just told me that in middle school her reading teacher spent half a semester teaching them about stocks: how to read about them in the paper and setting up a mock portfolio and following it. 

IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.
1183 2018-12-30 21:27:31 Who knows someone who stocks TO niacinamide in Nairobi?
1184 2018-12-30 21:26:56 Tellin me it creates jank when i die to a fucking bayonetta at 100 on wario ware when shes averaging stocks at 300 now
1185 2018-12-30 21:26:47 I have bought stocks for many years, and the more i learn the more i realize i have to read more and practice more in real, and also start with and stick to a tradingplan. the results from trading is far from what i would like it to be! Perhaps 2019 is the brakethrought!
1186 2018-12-30 21:26:13 I disagree with the Muslim ban, the wall, banning bump stocks, immigration policy ECT. But I agree with pulling our troops, buissenes rights, justice reform, ECT" the less government stuff.
1187 2018-12-30 21:24:22 Dumped all stocks years ago- only in CDs so I never worry anymore
1188 2018-12-30 21:23:59 Thatcher decimated the U.K. society and de-skilled few generations because of her failed diversification into banking and stocks and making the U.K. ‘a warehouse ‘economy with little manufacturing capabilities. These achievements are not magnificent and she did nothing for women.
1189 2018-12-30 21:23:52 For the record I love wisdom, stocks, options, wealth, trucks, sports cars, fine dining, politics, God, cursing, and I love all kinds of women, and I adore my children!
1190 2018-12-30 21:22:53 Mr. President the prison reform bill I need you to add an amendment to it, I want all inmate serving time who is working while they are in prison, I want them taught how to use 80% of their money they get paid while in prison and invest it into the emerging markets! Penny stocks!
1191 2018-12-30 21:22:41 Why should it be legal for gun manufacturers be allowed to sell military style automatic weapons, bump stocks, 30 round magazines? Try again.
1192 2018-12-30 21:22:41 Lo más cómico es que lo dice la mamerta que admira al burro indultado que piensa que “Stocks” son inventarios 
1193 2018-12-30 21:19:59 Yep plus put a #MAGA bumper sticker on it then sit back and invest in pharmaceutical stocks.  There’s nothing better than making money off liberals hysteria.
1194 2018-12-30 21:19:50 @sainsburys Hi, could you confirm whether your store in Castle Marina - Nottingham stocks are 18-36 month Tommee Tippee dummies? We are travelling up & I’m fully aware not many places stock them.
1195 2018-12-30 21:18:51 Dans mon ancien ciné, on faisait une brocante tous les ans, pour écouler les stocks d'affiches qui nous restaient. Peut-être la même chose là-bas ?
1196 2018-12-30 21:18:12 It’s very telling to get a lot of texts from friends and family on which stocks to buy on @RobinhoodApp.

They’re unsophisticated investors which leads me to believe we’ve topped.
1197 2018-12-30 21:16:41 50% OFF the ENTIRE STORE! Fresh Stocks of Flower, Edibles, and Concentrate! Sale goes through the 31st!! Come in while supplies last!! We may be closing temporarily on January first for state licensing until further notice.
1198 2018-12-30 21:16:19 Feeling 100% confident dumping thousands of dollars into weed stocks with the financial accumen I have from playing runescape
1199 2018-12-30 21:16:05 Ncb stocks looks tempting but the price..... Lawwwd
1200 2018-12-30 21:13:30 They had more before the short report then now , I agree . If they want institutional support I wouldn’t think this would be the best route. Also don’t think margin was available for stocks on CSE . Will have to check though as I don’t use margin often .
1201 2018-12-30 21:13:27 We may soon be entering a bear market, but it's not time to panic if you're an investor.

As Warren Buffett wrote in his 2016 letter to shareholders, investors should do two things when stocks are falling: stay in the market and buy at a bargain.
1202 2018-12-30 21:12:45 Tell this to the people that sold their stocks because the market has had a bad month. Now you have to find another entry point.
1203 2018-12-30 21:12:23 What kind of effect will an actual deal with China have on gold prices? We could have an insane rebound in stocks.
1204 2018-12-30 21:11:56 Soybean is also a function of diesel cost.  Look at 2013,2014.  Hard to tell the impact of tariffs.  Stocks are up, because they are speculating to sell at a higher price. In 2019.
1205 2018-12-30 21:09:10 Ah, I see. My bad!!  Awesome Commish!!  Too early for me haha
1206 2018-12-30 21:07:48 Why not use the WDBG chart??
1207 2018-12-30 21:07:09 You will be stopped 97 percent or more on every high atr stocks .
1208 2018-12-30 21:04:06 The third one is How to Trade in Stocks by Jesse Livermore, material added by Richard Smitten - it is a must-read for stock trader. It teaches you the essence of stock trading and general methodology.
1209 2018-12-30 21:03:39 Sadly not. Islington stocks them - beyond that I’m afraid I’m as in the dark as you are.
1210 2018-12-30 21:00:35 It could be a platform for startup companies to raise capital that functions like stocks. If you own 1 coin = 1 share of the company’s profit and asset just like stocks. Less regulated than stocks. Maybe they only report earning every 6 months or annually instead of quarterly
1211 2018-12-30 21:00:16 For sure: they are The Disciplined Trader and Trading in the Zone both by Mark Douglas - these two books have helped me developing an overall mind-set about trading stocks. I have read them at least five times and still reading them everyday.
1212 2018-12-30 20:59:55 c'est pas faux. Mais il faudrait savoir de quand date ces prélèvements et quels sont les stocks constitués...
1213 2018-12-30 20:59:35 I believe you. Bush, Jr recently and mysteriously shut down his twit account and Where has big-mouthed Maxine Waters gone? They're going mysteriously silent and absent from the public. Like you said, it's going to be very subtle and low key but it's happening nonetheless.
1214 2018-12-30 20:59:27 Derwin and kittle stocks are high next yr in fantasy
1215 2018-12-30 20:51:56 yeah but if also it can risk damaging stocks if they fuck up release because its sitting there also people would get pissed about waiting
1216 2018-12-30 20:51:48 Especially the ones with prison stocks.
1217 2018-12-30 20:51:08 There have been arrests, wrong. Have you seen them lately?
1218 2018-12-30 20:49:51 @MTGStocks Is it possible to search the MTG Stocks API via multiverse ID?
1219 2018-12-30 20:49:40 Approve $10+ Billion for the border wall, but stipulate that it be made from solar panels! Sell the electricity to Mexico and other countries and it will pay for itself in the long run. Solar manufacturing stocks will flourish. Everybody wins!

1221 2018-12-30 20:46:00 What cuntery this is. You're a poor psychic. 

Stock dividends (payouts) are taxed as income because they are but stocks are not and cannot be taxed as they have no definite value until they are cashed.

The collective intel of the gov isn't relevent, nor is my income.
1222 2018-12-30 20:45:51 Besides porn, making money off stocks Is my dream job, working from a laptop or even just my phone
1223 2018-12-30 20:44:19 Don’t wait to buy the right stocks, buy the right stocks and wait. A Vanguard Index fund will do nicely!
1224 2018-12-30 20:41:52 The best family time in Sark  we were spoiled by perfect weather, amazing food , cosseted by lovely staff at Stocks hotel .
1225 2018-12-30 20:41:10 Well the only people that would ever come for your guns are law enforcement officers. So you are saying you shoot cops? That's effed up man.

Also, how does it feel to have Trump cave in and ban bump stocks? You are losing.

1229 2018-12-30 20:38:03 Call me nuts but the concept of selling stocks & selling drugs are extremely similar
1230 2018-12-30 20:37:40 Exactly ask them how their stocks are doing?
1231 2018-12-30 20:37:00 Predictable & predicted. The last Obama budget expired last year. Like everyone who pays attention, I'd long predicted Republicanomics to kick down this year. It did. 
FWIW, I expected US stocks to take their first big hit earlier.
1232 2018-12-30 20:36:45 Yeah the Pittsburgh Pirates got busted last year for basically trading players like penny stocks and evading league fees.
1233 2018-12-30 20:34:51 We all know this is a plea to not abandon stocks so these "gurus" have time to get their profits on the way out the door. Sell now or regret it later.

1236 2018-12-30 20:32:18 Rob @RobInTheBlack teaches broadening formations at @t3live He uses price action of Japanese candle stick patterns within those broadening formations. He doesn't use lagging indicators. Price action is the best indictor. Period... #TheStrat $STUDY #Stocks $SPY

1238 2018-12-30 20:32:10 That house of that evil women is as corrupt as they come. Does not even live in her own district and manipulates the law to benefit her stocks and the position of her family members in business. A truly wretched women.
1239 2018-12-30 20:32:03 Full of bump stocks
1240 2018-12-30 20:32:03 Your thoughts are mainstream but wrong. China does not lend money to USA directly, the totalitarian regime buys and sells treasury via open market in USA and Europe. When you buy Apple stocks, you are not financing Apple inc. China simply buys USA treasury to earn interest.
1241 2018-12-30 20:31:56 you know, put it on stocks and let me use my main and I'd take the challenge.

So happy you're coast guard in SC are seeing you for the you are. Devastating to economy in Hilton Head and the way you have literally told them saving lives aren't valued to you. Or maybe you have stocks in payday lenders like Mick.
1243 2018-12-30 20:30:40 Consumer sentiment at record high. Small business confidence at record high. Black unemployment at record low. Stocks at record highs. #MAGA
1244 2018-12-30 20:30:03 But from a more serious perspective, buying undervalued stocks is also a projection/prediction, albeit a less precise one. Even statistical arbitrage is some form of prediction. Good price discovery gets rewarded!
1245 2018-12-30 20:30:02 Since earning an uptick in minutes recently, Dewayne Dedmon is averaging 12.2 PPG, 9.5 RPG with 2.1 stocks (stl+blk) the past 11G. The dude is also stretching the floor hitting 47.2% of his 3-pointers in ths sample. Another 2019 free agent and a great trade target for Philly.

If you aren’t part of the solution, you’re part of the problem!

Still wish I had bought popcorn stocks!
1247 2018-12-30 20:27:26 Did trump banning bum stocks on guns get a lot coverage? Feel like it didn’t
1248 2018-12-30 20:26:38 Would you recommend this one for stocks as well (or is this book more applicable to forex?)
1249 2018-12-30 20:25:45 I have a second account Thomas Kaine on Stocks @kaine_on for sharing stock market and other investment information...look forward to sharing ideas on investing
1250 2018-12-30 20:24:50 The vile scum who does this barbaric outdated cruel act needs whipping put in stocks never to live in a decent society again. STOP HUNTING NOW. make it a punishable crime & the police courts uphold it. This us not acceptable in today's world.
1251 2018-12-30 20:24:35 Notice that George Bush, Jr.'s twitter account has gone Silent & is No Longer Active? Just 1 high profile example of a person whose wife got an envelope. Laura & Jeb reacted Very negatively 2what they read. George, Jr looked stunned & was maybe under the effects of tranquilizer.

1253 2018-12-30 20:23:30 Plus, you could be in control of putting it into mutual funds and stocks you choose.
1254 2018-12-30 20:21:43 Yes, if you can recommend good stocks
1255 2018-12-30 20:21:14 Stocks are for rich people, not average people.
1256 2018-12-30 20:21:13 oh I forgot the red wine spears; they were good. But that poor Sicilian village! They really trashed it, plus I bet there were casualties. Should have been a post-credits sequence showing all the aquatic superpeople helping the villagers rebuild & replacing their red wine stocks.
1257 2018-12-30 20:20:52 Sebastian Gorka, a very good profit, sometimes record profits-there stocks are doing a great guy and a new book.
1258 2018-12-30 20:19:02 True... Once you find a legit home. That's the problem... Many many fake, charlatans out there in this space.

Easy for you and @cml41987 to say bc your room trades real stocks, with real education for a very reasonable cost.


1259 2018-12-30 20:18:54 Here’s Jim Carey crying as usual about an AMERICAN President!!
Too good to pass up!!
BTW, I wonder which country he made his money in?
Think he made money on stocks going up? 
Yep. 
But it wasn’t under O’s reign of terror on Americans.
1260 2018-12-30 20:18:23 Ike is busted yo. Simple but still really strong, and he’s got so many ways to end stocks. He’s definitely a very healthy character to have right now
1261 2018-12-30 20:14:37 Sure would be better investment at this point. My stocks are taking a beating!
1262 2018-12-30 20:14:13 If I couldn’t use it all, I’d consider trying to generate some income before year’s end. Need to compare with increases in non federal taxes, economics, etc., but I could convert some ira into Roth, sell stocks at gains, etc. NOT TAX ADVICE!!!
1263 2018-12-30 20:13:48 Got out of stocks a few months ago and am in boring conservative investments but at least not losing anything.
1264 2018-12-30 20:10:56 Why are people risking life n limb to get out of France if EU land is full of milk n honey and has a far more secure future than Brexit Britain?
Why are expert fund managers that have future returns uppermost in mind, paying record prices for UK stocks?
1265 2018-12-30 20:09:32 A market correction was coming no matter what Trumpy did. Tech stocks were way over valued. Wages have gone up. I didn't like that Trump pushed the stock market was his doing anyway. It really wasn't. 
But I do like that he lowered taxes and is trying to restrict the labor market
1266 2018-12-30 20:09:28 My neighbour has a large bush of this at the end of our shared front garden path, the flowers are small but wow the perfume is wonderful, I've actually got some scented summer stocks still in bloom in the sheltered back yard.

1269 2018-12-30 20:08:48 I believe Trump have stocks in Twitter
1270 2018-12-30 20:05:00 i just joined quickplay as Ness and fought two King K Rools in one match. they projectile spammed me till i died and they both still had 3 stocks left lol

1272 2018-12-30 20:03:40 but there is huuuuuge coloration between us stocks and bitcoin 1st. december bitcoin felt then january us stocks felt now again bitcoin from 6k to 3k then us stoks huge dump now us stocks backing up little bit bitcoin too. But US stocks will go more down after bitcoin.
1273 2018-12-30 20:02:41 Kept winning 4 player matches with Cloud. Gets a 1v1 against Falcon and ragequits the match after losing 2 stocks. Also he failed to recover...as King K. Rool.
1274 2018-12-30 20:02:16 Economy feels much better today. 2008 was obvious, imho. Stocks just ran way ahead of themselves 2016-18
1275 2018-12-30 20:01:54 Bullshit. Liberals don’t say that. They say they want tighter reviews so mentally ill people cannot buy firearms and that assault rifles & bump stocks should be banned bc they are designed to kill many on a grand scale quickly, so not made for simple safe defense or hunting.
1276 2018-12-30 20:01:32 also, if anyone knows anything about investing and stocks dm me

1281 2018-12-30 19:57:49 CERC was one of my Stocks I researched at .60
I didn’t buy it after all said go, so once again I sat on my hands and did nothing. Today, CERC - Cerecor Inc. is priced at $3.14 Did I learn my lesson? I hope so. I fell into the “Hesitation Trap”.
1282 2018-12-30 19:56:26 Our stocks are down. Thanks a lot, Trump you pieceacrap.
1283 2018-12-30 19:54:54 Stick to talking about stocks only please....
1284 2018-12-30 19:54:23 Guys invest. Please. In stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate.. etc. just save and invest.
1285 2018-12-30 19:54:11 You've still not shown me an accounting framework where stocks, bonds and deposits are not counted as assets though. Surely if you're correct this should be easy. You said you could about twenty minutes ago, yet here I wait, wondering if I'll ever trust again.
1286 2018-12-30 19:53:34 @EG_PPMD Hey your interview was great! Quick mentality question: 

I struggle a lot with keeping composure through anxiety mid set. I've noticed you laugh a lot after lost stocks/games. Is that deliberate to stay positive? Is there anything else you do to stay focused/calm?

1291 2018-12-30 19:48:37 @Rudsk_jdm what stocks you looking at bro ?
1292 2018-12-30 19:46:40 No, you said that bank deposits, stocks and bonds are not financial assets. In what system of accounting is this true? Can you give examples? Otherwise it sounds like a shockingly illiterate statement.
1293 2018-12-30 19:45:11 A bit late?  After the recent 20% pullback, stocks are actually very fairly priced.

1297 2018-12-30 19:43:08 That would be really interesting to see, an accounting system that doesn’t include holdings of bonds, deposits and stocks as assets. How does it hold together, how does it ensure stock-flow-consistency? I’m genuinely interested

1300 2018-12-30 19:39:53 Well like I said make sure you go and turn in any bump stocks you may own. Trump is going to start banning weapon accessories for law abiding civilians so you should get on that ASAP or he will come and take them. Thanks for your cooperation.
1301 2018-12-30 19:39:53 Il est interdit de (re)vendre ses stocks à perte, pour éviter des effets d’éviction de la concurrence. Il y a des exceptions comme la cessation d’activité par exemple, l’obsolescence etc. L’entre-deux saisons est une de ces exceptions très encadrées.
1302 2018-12-30 19:39:50 I lost like 5 stocks to this yesterday so I labbed it and both Pikachu and Pichu can consistently use the new magnet spike mechanic and KO characters at any % if they fast fall thunder offstage...& then recover after because you get KO’d before the bolt hits them/stops their fall
1303 2018-12-30 19:39:32 Where do you buy them? Game no longer stocks them.
1304 2018-12-30 19:38:56 Well the key take away is that there was a housing bubble on 2007. We do not have any sort of bubble in the markets right now, and I’m not sure why people think we do. High growth tech stocks are trading at just 15 times their earnings.
1305 2018-12-30 19:38:20 Yeah, I am interested in Ivysaur but I hate how it switches automatically between stocks. This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I don't like the switching gimmick at all. I wish they were all separate characters. That way they could all have unique Down Bs
1306 2018-12-30 19:38:00 Anyone turn in their bump stocks yet? Asking for a friend.

1310 2018-12-30 19:34:43 More likely the top 10 will do exactly what they set out to do and the rest will trade like penny stocks IMO
1311 2018-12-30 19:32:10 Can you show me any method of accounting that doesn’t list bank deposits, bonds or stocks as assets? I’d be interested to know.

1323 2018-12-30 19:23:24 Let's not forget the biggest point gain in stocks EVER happened right after the biggest single day loss. I'm sure you won't hear that happened from this network.

1329 2018-12-30 19:17:42 The American people need to sell there stocks, take There money out of the bank, stay home and shut down America , and watch the rich people go broke, then start over without Democrats and Republicans
1330 2018-12-30 19:17:22 True, but not nearly enough to get the payouts given.  And when stocks go down, does the pension payment?  Nope.

1337 2018-12-30 19:15:04 You know that money goes into stocks and it compounds considerably as it reaches higher amounts. You get back what you put in.
1338 2018-12-30 19:14:20 Well as I recall it wasn't much of an apology. I'm just looking at it broadly. Getting back to your first point. He has an impulse control problem.

1340 2018-12-30 19:09:56 Exactly!  People are like "Who cares about...Bump Stocks..." or whatever issue of the day.  They know, as we all should from watching human development, that to give an inch is to eventually request a mile.  Plus, a precedent, is one of the most dangerous things out there.
1341 2018-12-30 19:09:15 Have capital gain taxes to pay in 2019? Got caught purchasing tokens or stocks that are now near 0 with no possible recovery?

Make sure to sell these so you can file for capital losses, before tax year ends. In many countries (e.g. Canada & US), the tax year ends on Dec 31st.

1346 2018-12-30 19:07:31 Not to trade the stocks like $east that you promote and focus on $grat. Basically follow around people with proven track records of success and not track records of failure like yourself. You're a baby too buddy. I don't care how cute that dog is im coming at you hard.

1349 2018-12-30 19:03:41 There can be no words to describe the 'low-life' who did this to your in-laws. I hope they are able to recover physically and mentally from the ordeal. Put these criminals in the stocks naked, give your in-laws the knotted ropes and let them endure punishment Casino Royale style
1350 2018-12-30 19:03:17 yeah mr. I have 1 stock compared to ridleys 3 stocks

1352 2018-12-30 19:00:22 Those non-interest-bearing assets received in the swap were commonly exchanged for financial assets: Stocks in the US, bonds and real estate in Germany.
1353 2018-12-30 18:57:51 Ended the year 38% up across the PF which I’m pleased with. I did that by taking larger positions in researched stocks and slicing out profits after big rises but being able to still maintain core LT positions to some of which I am now adding to after big drops.
1354 2018-12-30 18:57:28 Real question should be how do we deincentivize pols from acting the interests that solely benefit them. Blind trusts are ineffective, knowing that if WF stocks do well, you do well is self-defeating. Active ownership of sticks is surely not the answer, I'm open to suggestions
1355 2018-12-30 18:57:16 The stocks lost all gains in a day. Then a nominal bounce back then another massive loss.
1356 2018-12-30 18:56:27 No secret the financial stocks have been beaten up hard through 2018. Obviously the best one to short is Deutsche Bank. This one has barely got the strength to stand up up let alone handle any economic issues it may face in 2019.
1357 2018-12-30 18:56:23 Many economic leaders and advisors are predicting a massive collapse. Most economists predict a massive loss in stocks by late 19 early 20. Its temporary and it’s fueled by delusion
1358 2018-12-30 18:55:12 y’all really got to get into stocks mane. now is the time.
1359 2018-12-30 18:54:09 People who buy bonds are providing the incentive to borrow regardless of what the Fed is doing. If people bought stocks or real estate instead of bonds then less debt would be created.

1374 2018-12-30 18:43:58 When I started trading I had a hard time recognizing valuable tweets vs pumpers/fury/guessers/ etc. The following helped... stocks go up when ppl buy/down when they sell. When ppl say “this will go up/down”, understand their reason & see if it’s supported by volume i.e. buy/sell.

1380 2018-12-30 18:36:01 The "risk assets" should embrace dovishly higher rates as they did in 2017 based on the correct interpretation then and it's true now that the higher rates are the bigger ammo for the Fed to use when the stocks really need Fed's rescue. The hikes to date are for stock's sake.

1388 2018-12-30 18:29:00 Agree with a # of caveats/interpretations: 1. Risk assets= stocks for most tweeter readers; 2. Fed's interest rate increases past and expected are not modest they are dovish. November YoY core inflation is 2.2%. IOER after December increase is 2.4%. .2% above infl is very low!

1392 2018-12-30 18:26:36 In my portfolio I have 100% stocks, but diversified amongst US Large, Small, and diversified international (developed and emerging markets). I don't plan on ever needing to touch it, so I don't have any bonds in it.
1393 2018-12-30 18:26:34 No thanks to you. And the gains were modest,  stocks have fallen, you closed the Gov so lots of workers aren't getting  a salary  and all those who make a living from the buying power of those workers also feel the pain.

1396 2018-12-30 18:25:54 Not over the longer term because companies earn profits and generate cash, which they use to pay dividends and buy back their stock, so that you don’t systemically need a greater fool to buy your stocks in order to cash out, unlike with crypto Ponzi coins.

1428 2018-12-30 18:02:28 Indeed. Portfolio should consist minimum 5 and maximum 10 stocks.
1429 2018-12-30 18:02:27 thats most likely part of the issue - we do have people tailoring most of if not their entire identity around video game consumption and to avoid a hurt sense of identity, they may sway towards narratives that strengthen it like stocks falling bc lootboxes or saint blizz the pure
1430 2018-12-30 18:01:46 So much talk about strong economy.  Is it entirely based upon low paying jobs now?  Reagan admin changed formula for unemployment so that millions unemployed are no longer counted.  Trump admin seems to only count employment. What about sales, stocks and home starts? No more?

1460 2018-12-30 17:34:25 The overarching message from your outlook is that we are nearing the closing stages of the business cycle. Yes stocks are cheap and not close to a recession, but nearing end of cycle nonetheless.

1461 2018-12-30 17:34:06 Interest rates aren’t the only tool.

1480 2018-12-30 17:16:42 Thanks I remember reading that Siegel article a while back. Very useful empirical analysis. Worth keeping in mind that if we set a threshold of beating market by 3% a year over only 10 of 50 Nifty stocks made the cut. Most were in 24-29x P/E range, or 25%-50% premium to mkt PE.

1492 2018-12-30 17:05:39 @SallyBuzbee my 2019 AP wish list:
• Money in Politics. Cause/affect/actionable way forward
•Congress can buy stocks with knowledge that would put you or me in jail. EXPOSURE PLZ! 
•How USA votes. In 40sec's I can identify eligibility for loans, healthcare. We cant VOTE?

1496 2018-12-30 17:03:12 But isn't that because QE begets the need for more QE? I'm a stock guy not a goldbug (but I do own gold/silver). The debt is the issue. It is abnormally high and the only real way to make it go away is inflation (which should hurt growth and subsequently highly valued stocks).

1500 2018-12-30 17:00:37 If you have X amount of stocks or Real estate, although it is worth 3X at maturation, you only have 3X when someone buys it.
That funds leverage new speculation on their 3X is what drives asset bubbles.
Therefore asset prices on paper are not indicative of money in the economy.

1508 2018-12-30 16:58:51 This wasn't been surprised me at all..
Bump stocks seems useless to me anyway,they doesn't provide stable automatic fire..

1512 2018-12-30 16:55:40 Hey guys, you know that @Malicelast has 3 stocks? You should probably do something about that.
1513 2018-12-30 16:55:23 Stick to stocks man, the interviews r finished.
1514 2018-12-30 16:55:17 Si n'importe quel commerçant était libre de liquider ses stocks comme il l'entend, ça réduirait d'autant la clientèle des "grands magasins" qui peuvent afficher des prix plus bas au quotidien ...
1515 2018-12-30 16:54:32 Yes, and thats why shorting indicies can be tricky, right? 

I think shorting individual stocks is where you find edge as a trendfollowing, dont you think?
1516 2018-12-30 16:52:41 Yep exactly. He was one of many accounts I kept an eye on to see which stocks to avoid.

1519 2018-12-30 16:51:38 There is only one strategy to “minimize” uncertainty in the stock market. Buy stocks of dependable companies and collect dividends. Cash-flow is paramount for most fixed income investors. For young investors, use index funds and hope the economy grows. Then focus on saving.
1520 2018-12-30 16:51:16 That's why I went with VXX... figured my competition was the most volatile stocks people could find. And most of them move with the market.

1526 2018-12-30 16:48:31 Its been said time and time again but many refuse to underatand that the value of crypto can NOT be valued the same was stocks are valued ( marketcap/coin supply) prime examples ETH (unlimited) XRP( 99 billion) look where their prices were... people dont want UNDERSTAND this..

1531 2018-12-30 16:44:01 Any technique involving stocks has inherent risk; to throw in short term option trading definitely increases that risk. Trading successfully involves finding an “edge,” a tool that enhances your chance of being correct about a trade that other people don’t possess.

1542 2018-12-30 16:34:12 right now it looks like im taking an L in robinhood stocks but time will tell (taking a risk with sears stock, hopefully they make a major comeback)

1577 2018-12-30 16:11:11 When you're buying / selling stocks you're in a direct competition with other market participants. What gives us, as private investors, an edge over professional investors with all the resources at their command?  Because those guys are on the other side of the trade.
1578 2018-12-30 16:10:36 MLPs trade like energy stocks but have more earnings stability and higher yields and growth. There is normally a large January effect where MLPs outperform the market.Also, they are so undervalued there are likely to be some takeouts by private equity and corporate buyers.#Income

1580 2018-12-30 16:09:59 I wonder who'll hand in their bump stocks in 2019 
1581 2018-12-30 16:09:44 Looking at lots of charts and see tons of stocks -50% from their highs. Scary thing is that most think a market crash is -50% and that things bounce from there. $SPX is only like 14% from highs. If $SPX falls hard, those stocks will see -75% or more. Look at the corporate debt!!

1583 2018-12-30 16:08:15 Customers create jobs not businesses. Businesses that already exist do better w more money (no matter who it comes from). Banks create up to 90% of the money they loan, they keep all the real money and multiply it by 1000. Rich don't put money in banks, they put it in stocks, etc
1584 2018-12-30 16:07:34 Our pension is fixed, but the funds are in stocks, bonds, etc
1585 2018-12-30 16:07:06 And I'm pissed that 40,000 died from guns this year and you defend the right for military style weapons with high capacity mags and bump stocks. One cop getting killed is tragic but 60 killed and another 500 wounded in one incident isn't?
1586 2018-12-30 16:04:13 Remember how fraud worked in Silicon Valley in the late '90s? "Hey, you buy a bunch of stuff from me and I'll buy an offsetting amount of stuff from you, and then we can each book the revenue and our stocks will go up!"

1597 2018-12-30 15:52:40 A cap means the dollars above the cap is not even taxed, that is why it is called a cap. On loophole used is CEOs taking only $1 salary and taking stocks for their salaries just to pay less taxes because dividends are not taxed as much #msnbc

1603 2018-12-30 15:49:35 What is more concerning IMHO is de de-equitization of the US stock market. The global decline in listings is a sign of growing instability in the financial system. Having fewer listings hamper asset allocation and make stocks relatively more expensive.

Progress marches on.
Common sense gun laws will prevail.

1617 2018-12-30 15:36:36 He's the one who said how Trump was approached by military etc.. I have been a big supporter of Trump but he banned bump stocks and not even Obama did that. I can't help but have doubts we're all being played  these deep state losers belong in jail
1618 2018-12-30 15:35:01 I worked for a Mutual Funds Company, so understand stocks...

1622 2018-12-30 15:30:54 you did not believe the 11.1 before it happened.  we had this discussion before. 

As for US stocks, we almost touched 2015 levels... when prices were below $40...
1623 2018-12-30 15:29:17 #fakenews The market is slowing and stocks are even worse. Interest rates going up. Your tax cut in the super wealthy failed to create jobs in the US, but did create plenty overseas. And we've lost out on new trade agreements. #weakpresident
1624 2018-12-30 15:28:31 If u believe 'Hindu Khatre Mein Hain'

If u feel 'Economy is on golden run'

If u think 'India has not taken any loan in last 4 years'

If u read 'there was no terrorism since 2014'

If u trust 'Rafale was a fair deal'

Just sell RPG stocks. This guy will tell you everything.
1625 2018-12-30 15:27:18 There are a few Galil stocks with minor differences, Vektor is based on one of them but I don't know which off the top of my head

@petromatrix
Total US petroleum stocks unchanged vs year ago. Last year: we're running out of stocks. This year: we're swimming in stocks. True difference is sentiment of forward outlook.
1629 2018-12-30 15:22:57 I suspect one of the principal reasons is the recent winding down of significant #DarkInventory (h/t @izakaminska ) where economic interest in petroleum stocks opaquely held by funds has now reverted to producer 'free float'
1630 2018-12-30 15:22:18 Let us know what you would like us to do for you in 2019??

1631 2018-12-30 15:22:08 Tomorrow is last day to sell stocks to take a tax loss. Question is does anyone have gains this year to take losses? Going to be buying $ROKU for year end play, Buying $NBEV on dips shorting $FB on all rallies, new Congress will not be friendly to $FB $TWTR
1632 2018-12-30 15:20:11 Most of us would fail at valuing people in our lives when they are right there with us. We know their value only when they are gone forever. 

Just like stocks, we might sell them cheap, only to see them rise beyond our reach.

1633 2018-12-30 15:18:46 Yes .  You say real estate  is the best.  But to take 1 million and put in a few stocks that will go up fast, one can take the money  out in a day and not weeks or months.
1634 2018-12-30 15:15:36 In other news...@Uber stocks just went up 
1635 2018-12-30 15:12:57 Stocks plunged as J.C. Penney Company, Inc. unveiled a unmotivated laser pointer today.
1636 2018-12-30 15:12:55 So noone says stocks? I understand you'll lose money eventually but isn't worth the risk?
1637 2018-12-30 15:12:13 Total US petroleum stocks unchanged vs year ago. Last year: we're running out of stocks. This year: we're swimming in stocks. True difference is sentiment of forward outlook.

1639 2018-12-30 15:09:26 Le Roi still gets mentioned o. Made French players; Deschamps, Zidane, Trezeguet, Thuram&Veira more adored at Turin. 

As a small boy, I saw the Triple Euro footballer of the year Award winner at Mexico86. He was unplayable. The knack for scoring goals increased his stocks.

1641 2018-12-30 15:07:20 Devistating to see them realt pack it in like that. Killed draft stocks on that whole D too

Markets all oversold too and ready
Money will return to sub £20mln caps too imho as per AIM volume
1643 2018-12-30 15:06:43 Increase in dollar price is due to withdraw of money from FII from world market including India and investing in US bonds ....

Increased dollar price will give good profit for IT and pharma companies who export service and products to US... SO price of these stocks will increase
1644 2018-12-30 15:05:14 Toby, any plan on releasing an Acquirers Multiple ETF? As buying top 20 stocks is costly for a retail investor
1645 2018-12-30 15:03:41 But when stocks are up and something good happens you praise Obama...

1647 2018-12-30 15:02:30 The two HEO teams impressed this weekend. Some kids definitely raised their stocks. Let the kids get noticed. Hopefully HEO can send teams to titans/silverstick/marlies in the future. #Exposure
1648 2018-12-30 15:01:48 There aren’t a half million stocks and there is a law suite already filed
1649 2018-12-30 14:56:22 1.Only Long. 
2.Because stock is in Uptrend or Bullish, Bullish stocks never short.
3.First to understand the graph, I will consider both daily and weekly graph, I will draw a support line in weekly and convert into daily and my entry from a weekly support.
1650 2018-12-30 14:55:05 Trump is setting us up for a worse recession then Bush did. The wealthy have now bought back their stocks, r still cutting and sending jobs overseas and now #Trump has nixed raises. Hold on America
1651 2018-12-30 14:54:57 You are asking for people to GoFundMe basically you are asking money as a homeless in the street and you want to buy stocks come on!!!!!!
1652 2018-12-30 14:54:48 stop flexing your 785 dollars on your 2002 daewoo lanos and invest in some stocks or property .
1653 2018-12-30 14:53:31 Thanks. Im focusing more on Options, maybe some penny stocks, but I’ve found Im not too good with penny stocks have to practice more, I do much better with stocks $20 and up.
1654 2018-12-30 14:51:32 Say you had 2 choices for next 2 years:

1) economy strengthens, stocks recover to new highs into 2020, making Trump look somewhat good

2) economy weakens, markets fall, recession risks rise sharply, making Trump look bad

Which option do you choose. No b/s speeches. 1 or 2
1655 2018-12-30 14:44:28 Come back to me when the equities markets take a big steamy dump. An if the bond bubble, real estate bubble, and student loan debt bubble pop, which they will, you will see all these rich bastards scrabbling like rats trying to put there money where? Bitcoin, PM's, & weed stocks.
1656 2018-12-30 14:44:27 Would @potus be responsible if you chose to jump off a bridge because your stocks were down and you couldn't afford more taxes to pay for illegals? @FAIRImmigration @USATODAY @TheDemocrats @StephMillerShow @seanhannity @OversightDems @AdamSchiff @nytimes @HuffPost @latimes @NPR
1657 2018-12-30 14:44:02 The January Effect
According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the January Effect is a phenomenon whereby small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks starting around mid-December and continuing through the first few months of the new year.

1661 2018-12-30 14:43:12 Ouep, a mon niveau de job, j’ai toujours considéré les stocks comme du bonus sympa, mais en dehors de ma nego salariale. Pour un c level ds une grisse boite ceci dit c’est probablement différent ;)
1662 2018-12-30 14:42:37 We should bring back public stocks just for , his family, his administration, and every member of  Congress who enabled him - Democrats, Republicans or Independents. 
Put them in front of the Washington Monument. 
BYO rotten eggs and veggies.

1664 2018-12-30 14:40:49 You have to buy 5 stocks and hold them for 50 years. What stocks are you buying?

1666 2018-12-30 14:39:56 When to buy options, when market does not move for 5-7 trading days and VIX drops sharply, one buy slightly otm strangles. You can use NR 5 or NR 7
Scanner for stocks also
1667 2018-12-30 14:39:14 3.1% GDP for Q1 in the US? OMG no wonder stocks are getting clubbed. The Q1 print sub 2% could be the feds dovish pivot, the bottom of EM, too in USD and the buy the news in US stocks!

1669 2018-12-30 14:36:16 Thanks for the video.  One weakness is that you are picking your stocks in hindsight.  You need a way to screen for winners now (i.e. todays AMZN or MSFT) not cherry pick ones you know are winners. Do you have a way to do historical scans?
1670 2018-12-30 14:36:12 Until and unless the world’s central banks reverse course and once again undertake more Quantitative Easing, or “QE,” financial asset prices will continue to fall throughout 2019.  Stocks, bonds, real estate.  You name it.
1671 2018-12-30 14:35:20 What foolish nonsense. If I approve raising bank customer fees because my bank stocks increase in value, does that mean what the banks are doing, is a good thing for the public? This BS from big business is the same thing as they are heavily invested in the outrageous con job!
1672 2018-12-30 14:34:49 My stocks are fundamentally in the toilet.
1673 2018-12-30 14:34:44 So I have to sell my stocks because it’s not making me money but I’ve purchased another 3 different stocks-Apple, Walmart and USPS; hopefully this will make me money  
1674 2018-12-30 14:34:05 Bump stocks are about to be banned nationwide. The devices, which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, will be illegal to possess beginning in late March. People who own the devices will be required to surrender them to authorities or destroy them.
1675 2018-12-30 14:33:41 Sportsbook conversations: No social media, No kids, Master's in Business Administration, 20 years experience in the banking industry, stocks 401k love's to save money and invest it, great business mind and will help invest into you're business is a sports bettor dream come true.
1676 2018-12-30 14:33:32 Sth is going on. You saw spikes on stocks? All growing same time just before session closing to end up day on plus  crypto spikes like bull run start but then ... nothing. I'll wait too mainly because I feel that we enter bull zone for two months or so.
1677 2018-12-30 14:33:15 Lots of indicators screaming contrarian for stocks
1678 2018-12-30 14:32:51 Start expending our stocks of Spearfish.
1679 2018-12-30 14:32:22 One of biggest things I learned is not going to OTM with no time, even if you get the move if their is chop and decay end up where u started, the more expensive options are priced that way for a reason haha. Some of the stocks like TSLA if I got range and follow through OTM ok
1680 2018-12-30 14:31:44 Black Label Quartz back in stock! We repeat Black Label Quartz back in stock! Get them while stocks last!! We will be open 8am tomorrow morning! See you all there

1682 2018-12-30 14:31:14 Shares holder and stocks holders 2 difference.... Shares holder is holding % stocks of company. The prices will be cheaper than the market stocks. depending.
1683 2018-12-30 14:31:11 Huge key to stocks and world economy in 2019....and Trump's reelection 2020....
1684 2018-12-30 14:30:17 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
1685 2018-12-30 14:29:37 There is no way of 'keeping fish stocks healthy' in e.g. waters by proposing fish quotas slightly below or at scientifically advised levels aimed at preventing extinction. They were never healthy in the first place never mind  sustainable.
1686 2018-12-30 14:29:27 Until and unless the world’s central banks reverse course and once again undertake more Quantitative Easing, or “QE,” financial asset prices will continue to fall throughout 2019.  Stocks, bonds, real estate.  You name it."
1687 2018-12-30 14:28:24 Who told you that we buy stocks in premium. Never bought in premium
1688 2018-12-30 14:26:20 Interesting thanks for sharing, I'm starting to look into growth stocks myself.
1689 2018-12-30 14:26:18 Thanks ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩#MAGA
“We aren’t in a good spot,” one economist says, as uncertainty and drags on the economy threaten stocks. Analysts see a greater risk of downturns than at any point years. Destroy America!
1690 2018-12-30 14:26:13 Unpopular opinion: Crypto won't revolutionize the world in any meaningful way. It will continue to be a niche market of assets people trade, similar to penny stocks, but will never achieve mass adoption, or become actual currency.
1691 2018-12-30 14:25:56 "trumponomics"a good thing?I beg to differ.All of this brought to you by a man who has
Increased deficit by $1.7 trillion
Caused wages to drop 2%
Caused stocks to hit record low
Caused 401K to drop 10%
Tariffs=$40 bill bailouts
Against overtime pay
#TrumpShutDown
1692 2018-12-30 14:25:11 Inheriting is the only thing Trump has ever done, by the way. Yet he managed to make less of the fortune his father gave him than he would have made if he had invested in stocks.
1693 2018-12-30 14:24:48 Mr Sandeep then you should stop buying stocks in premium price..inform sebi and ask companies to sell book value...
1694 2018-12-30 14:23:29 Yeah, me too. The volatility in gas prices, food costs, loan/interest rates mean something. Stocks, not at all.
1695 2018-12-30 14:23:08 He played on all 4 teams and was a backup LB - started on punt and return teams, field goal and was a core player.  This is how New England stocks their team - add up total plays per game and I would bet its close to what Sharpe played

1698 2018-12-30 14:20:45 I need to learn about stocks
1699 2018-12-30 14:20:26 The stocks of pharmaceutical industries ( and medical devices, ect...) are owned by doctors. It makes financial sense to prescribe or recommend. Sale. 
1700 2018-12-30 14:19:15 But no bump stocks
1701 2018-12-30 14:19:12 I did, it doubled by july, then lost $3,000 after the dems took the house in the election. Stocks hate dems obstruction.
1702 2018-12-30 14:18:58 @CAS_AMSadique, power of Hind is ATGM. NAF ordered 300 AT-6, Russia delivered 50. AT-6 is old tech, NAF can get cheap 5 year old RuAF stocks AT-9 Ataka, so CAS will avoid blue on blue or civilian collateral damage. Thanks you sir
1703 2018-12-30 14:18:36 Jonathan couldn't flap from huggies stocks ?? :( 
1704 2018-12-30 14:17:41 What your favorite biotech stocks for a possible rebound? TIA
1705 2018-12-30 14:17:37 She and her husband BOTH need investigated regarding HOW he got the contract to sell off surplus and closed U S Postal properties. 

Insider trading is illegal when dealing with stocks, so it should be when relatives of ANY member of Congress profits from their relationships.
1706 2018-12-30 14:16:08 Great points - do you have some good sources to point me to? I'm writing about capitalism and incarceration--Columbia students managed to pressure CU to divest from private prison stocks btw, which was pretty amazing
1707 2018-12-30 14:15:51 Based on the formulation of the question are you saying things were worse under Obama than they were under Bush?  BTW, wrong on stocks.
1708 2018-12-30 14:15:00 Stocks 
1709 2018-12-30 14:14:59 Stocks that are newsworthy are posted here, at Stockscenter. ***Not a suggestion to buy or sell***
1710 2018-12-30 14:13:53 Yep, the 10 days of darkness are the ten days we're kept in the dark about the arrests of these major criminals. Talk about a Christmas gift to America and the world!
1711 2018-12-30 14:13:25 Extremely bearish December month bar for Dow, FTSE, DAX, CAC. Indian stocks may also come under pressure. Very less chance of Nifty crossing 11000. DII inflow is likely to get reduced due to negative MFs performance during the year 2018.
1712 2018-12-30 14:10:36 Amazing - don’t see pitchforks marching over his Bump Stocks E.O.!!! Laying foundation for dems to grab all guns when they own all 3 branches 2020, base too stupid to SEE!
1713 2018-12-30 14:10:32 My take is never bother about things we cannot control, it is a waste of time.

I know Silver will hit USD 35 - 44 by Spring 2021 , so the question is if I am picking my stocks right. Should see USD 21 -26 by end 2019 may be , followed by a good correction into Summer of 2020.
1714 2018-12-30 14:08:21 With technology you could easily find a buyer for your stock but it would require more work your have to produce the financials, shares sold and how much earnings are distributed yearly because dividends should be the main focus stocks should be a revenue stream like property
1715 2018-12-30 14:04:07 The bear market in gold stocks is alive and thriving. Garbage like GG is still out performing garbage like Blue Apron to the downside.
1716 2018-12-30 14:03:45 Not in all cases. You're missing out the fact that there is a case for speculative stocks. Yes, people speculate on house prices but there is also speculation in the markets also. You may not have done anything to earn appreciation in that case also
1717 2018-12-30 14:02:54 That is the issue we want to invest in businesses for the short term and this is why stocks are useless no one besides those that buy during an IPO are actually investing in the company because the only people that benefit from stock price increases are speculators and computers
1718 2018-12-30 14:00:49 I need someone to truly teach me about stocks.
1719 2018-12-30 14:00:47  who thinks up this #trumpPropaganda ? 

This won't work. You're in America

It was the worse loss in stocks. 

It was the worse because of #TaxS am and #ACA insurance hike 

It was worse w/ #NAFTA blunder and rises in prices: food, gas

Unemployment up! #TrumpShutdown
1720 2018-12-30 13:59:59 And bank stocks are currently at 2 year lows
1721 2018-12-30 13:58:33 Congress lost it stocks
1722 2018-12-30 13:58:23 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $ALE, $DAKT, $NRE, $SSW, all may climb w/in 8, 15, 9, 21 days up to 1.5%, 6%, 7.3%, 12.4% respectively

1725 2018-12-30 13:56:51 a gambler would go for 50 #stocks 

a new investor would go for 20 stocks

but if you are confident, 5 stocks are enough to make you rich

a modified whtsap frwrd tht sums up experience of #investing journey for many #longterm #investors in #StockMarket
1726 2018-12-30 13:53:18 For investing, pain is a sign you’re doing something right. If it feels good, that’s a bad sign.  It hurt a 1000 times more buying stocks in 2008.
1727 2018-12-30 13:52:42 Out of stocks pa kase
1728 2018-12-30 13:51:44 I have read your articles on diff stocks, really insightful and the one on Praxis & Dixon Tech is very good....thank you for sharing your wisdom, I will soon join your paid subscription.
1729 2018-12-30 13:51:17 This #Litecoin and UFC thing is freaking HILARIOUS. I can think of a handful of penny stocks that have done the same thing. Maybe not in as big a match, but then again depends on how much money you can blow. Wouldn’t say it’s a loss of credibility, but made me LMAO.
1730 2018-12-30 13:50:10 What ppl dont know is that feds are costing a lot since agencies arent protective or affective. Lossing money & add pensions benefits
& U.S. is worthless = 0 value stocks
1731 2018-12-30 13:50:04 I think the market will come back to 24k plus...... And then will really come down crashing #stocks
1732 2018-12-30 13:48:59 Looking at CRB Index charts today, broken bottom channel. Expect pain in oil, base metals, EV metals, U stocks for another two months. MMs will try to snatch your stocks if you are holding them weak. Expect gold and silver stks also to react -ve.
Expect bull mkt by end Feb 19.
1733 2018-12-30 13:47:01 Trying to push stocks up.  Overvalued as hell the stock market.  Push it up so I can short the damn thing
1734 2018-12-30 13:46:30 No wage gains since the CEOs who got tax breaks bought back their stocks instead. GM left. Carrier left. No one came back. New jobs resulted from Obamas economic policies which produced more jobs than you for 78 straight qtrs. Now your tariffs are killing jobs & farms. Good job!
1735 2018-12-30 13:46:11 When people talk about the stock market, remember this: 

50% of Americans aren’t invested in the stock market & 80% of all stocks are owned by the richest 10%. 

We don’t lack the wealth in America, we lack the moral distribution of it.

1737 2018-12-30 13:42:22 Here is one example why I am fascinated with Stats.  These are the large cap stocks which yielded positive returns in January 9/10 times in last 11 years.  ABC, AWK, CAH, CBOE, HSIC, ILMN, MXIM.  The average return on all of these stocks is above 3% in January.  Thanks.
1738 2018-12-30 13:41:29 It's not the PC government it's basic law of supply and demand why gas prices are low atm Donna. Oil stocks are high now. I'll bet you a Tim's coffee gas won't be 93 cents/L in January.
1739 2018-12-30 13:41:17 For long term investment (at least 5 years) we have to start filtering stocks with consistent track record of over 20% ROE.  That will lead one into the quality zone.
1740 2018-12-30 13:40:52 Definitely going to get educated in buying stocks
1741 2018-12-30 13:36:22 Stocks**
1742 2018-12-30 13:36:02 What’s your positioning strategy if you don’t mind me asking? Etfs or individual stocks or both and are you continuously accumulating?
1743 2018-12-30 13:35:06 Mnuchin & Trump have no idea how to run a government; all they know is clipping coupons on stocks. Even then, they have finance experts to tell them how/when to do so. Dad's left them money, or they'd be starving.
1744 2018-12-30 13:33:23 I’ve been shorting fakebook and twatter just for these reasons...:) I making money off their reasoning that as you can tell has sunk both is their stocks half way hahahaaaa FU @facebook @twitter  shorting since 45 and fakebook since 210 :) COVFEFE 0n both yes I’ve been banned..
1745 2018-12-30 13:32:59 Cnbc should have you instead those phonies who pump stocks for last ten years
1746 2018-12-30 13:31:46 Passengers we can’t do anything. Govt sees potential in them this is their 3rd extension. Govt busy with brexit atm. Money is spend of HS2. That’s why the short in stocks.

1748 2018-12-30 13:26:40 Hi there

I’ve been following progress on this for almost a year... I know where my nearest one is that stocks them (but always sold out) so I have to buy them in bulk online. 

So.... Do you have any update on when they’ll be available at all stores? Thanks

1755 2018-12-30 13:18:14 You’re going to be waiting a long time. You had your chance to start a negotiation and blew it by having the press there. That was a dumb move , thinking you would put Pelosi and Schumer on the defensive, no way. You’ve made a mess, with lies. Stocks down 20%, resign now. GUILTY.
1756 2018-12-30 13:18:03 Options will awipe you out. Don't get greedy!   Just trade stocks!

1760 2018-12-30 13:11:03 No, it's not an infringement & Trump signed a FEDERAL ban on bump stocks so it doesn't matter what state you live in. We've always had bans on various weapons throughout our history.

1772 2018-12-30 12:57:20 To be honest a decently experienced investor can always zero in the top 20 stocks, not so difficult in indian mkt. The challenge has always been what's the right price for stock and the sector. What was ok for auto last year ain't comfortable anymore.

1778 2018-12-30 12:48:51 Before a bull market tops out, you fall in love with your stocks. It is very hard to see them, because everyday you sell them, the prices goes up and you start feeling like a fool. #RameshDamani @masterclass_si #truestory

Get ready for big intraday 1st hour 3 to 4% move in fno stock from 2nd Jan. Operaters on holidays that's now they back to the business from 2nd Jan. Get ready for welcoming 2019 with lots of profits. Am here to make u rich. #stocks #nifty #banknifty
1780 2018-12-30 12:47:43 Which indicator to use to track Volume ?
On Balance Volume (OBV) 
or 
Accumulation / Distribution line (ADL)
- For illiquid stocks: prefer OBV
- For stocks with a lot of trading (low delivery): prefer OBV
- For stocks where you must track flows from MF / big money: use ADL
1781 2018-12-30 12:46:30 Anyone know if you can buy stocks in a company placed in administration?
1782 2018-12-30 12:46:13 Dude weed stocks lmao
1783 2018-12-30 12:45:46 I would invest in MULTI UNIT apartments and in MYSELF. Stocks, apps, etc don't last like CASH PRODUCING LAND.
1784 2018-12-30 12:41:26 One other important ingredient that is not yet developed in the UK is a means to finance reserve wines and other products in progress. Loans secured on winery stocks would widen investment potential exponentially and help domestic producers compete.

1786 2018-12-30 12:37:00 The ONLY thing that drove the market was the GOP promise of what the tax cut would deliver. As expected, companies used it to buy back stocks and increase dividends. That chapter over, there is ZERO he and Uncle Larry @ larry_kudlow have delivered to improve economic performance.
1787 2018-12-30 12:35:08 well,the stocks had 3 good days so I made some back,and he has pulled some of it out into safe things like GICs.Hope the scary times are over,not sure.

1792 2018-12-30 12:29:28 If you have some money to spare,invest in the stocks of pharmaceutical companies, researching on a vaccine against malaria. 
Global warming is democratizing malaria, one degree rise,at a time.
In a few years, malaria will be common in Europe.

1793 2018-12-30 12:29:04 Yep, stocks gonna go up
1794 2018-12-30 12:29:04 It's not just meat, it's animal products in some sweets/foods. Things like jellies, stocks etc made with animal products.
1795 2018-12-30 12:28:28 There’s a few players whose stocks are low which is really like jaylen brown and turner are 2 especially. 

I get the same feeling about those 2 that I do of Middleton a couple years back and now he’s getting the max. Missed our window
1796 2018-12-30 12:28:26 Suggesting ppl buy stocks to beat inflation after basing the premise on 1-year time frame is borderline... bad. $100 in equities could be worth $60 in 12 months obviously.
1797 2018-12-30 12:28:08 Usted tan inteligente señor, stocks!
1798 2018-12-30 12:27:28 And for anyone who doesn’t listen to the rubbish I listen to - that Arcturus album isn’t available on Amazon - physical or download/streaming. HMV stocks some great stuff.
1799 2018-12-30 12:27:25 Pot stocks look attractive.  Check out MJ ETF
1800 2018-12-30 12:26:33 The only thing I give him credit for is banning bump stocks otherwise he is just like that guy on the insurance commercial causing chaos and mayhem.
1801 2018-12-30 12:24:43 Hahahah ok! Stocks up record high again... happy to be a WORKING American and not giving my money to people who don’t
1802 2018-12-30 12:21:17 daghan pakog stocks diri. pain
1803 2018-12-30 12:20:36 I completely understand. I changed most of my portfolio from stocks to ETF's for the same reason. But as I am allowed to look at my portfolio all day at work I can afford to sell options on the stocks I have. The active management is currently no problem.
1804 2018-12-30 12:17:14 Just found out about a journal brand whose books have a page weight of a whopping 160gsm!!!! An NZ site stocks them but they’re out of stock rn but when they’re back I AM ABSOLUTELY BUYING ONE
1805 2018-12-30 12:16:06 Is it time to accumulate stocks in your portfolio is something that is on every ones mind? If one would have invested in the bank nifty 10 years back they would have made almost 400 percent plus on their captial. 
I would wait to see how the earnings play out before accumulating

Many are quoting what they leant in 2018. 

Sadly i didn't learn too many new things BUT old lessons were reiterated! 

1) stick to slow compounders & quality 
2) don't let multi bagger stories distract u
3) add to your portfolio stocks, when markets swoon big time

1832 2018-12-30 11:53:13 Does it matter? Stocks can disappear completely for all I care. Some speculators lose their money, boo hoo. Sure theyll cry about it and put on a big show, but it won't be economically devastating. We will move on.
1833 2018-12-30 11:53:03 What is your practical advice, Magnus? I am in two minds whether to buy SA stocks, or move all of assets offshore?
1834 2018-12-30 11:53:01 This is a big issue even with Govt employees. Keep getting paid fantastic salaries and perks that have nothing to do with market rates or ex chequers ability to pay them

1836 2018-12-30 11:44:53 I meant that was not the point I was making...

Incidentally, the UK fishing industry lost more jobs than the mining industry...super trawlers today are decimating cod stocks in the channel...it is not well managed & quotas are sold outside the UK. Needs reform.

1843 2018-12-30 11:37:34 stocks are held, as in China, USA etc, but recently we nearly ran out, prices went up. It was at bankruptcy levels in mid 1980s. indeed currently CAP is regarded as in need of constant reform ,it should be, & itis. I am not a huge fan but it’s not the terrible thing you make out.

1849 2018-12-30 11:31:44 Sort of. Finch does not open well and Bancroft is a proven option. Understand that he has a lot to do to be considered again. However batting stocks very very thin.
1850 2018-12-30 11:31:01 lmao, seriously the best place to earn a place in the test side nowadays is not in the test side.. these guys get dropped for making no runs but then somehow their stocks rise when they’re NOT in the side ?!?

1854 2018-12-30 11:27:34 Exactly, I want some stocks for dividends (high yield) and I also wouldn’t mind selling those stocks for a x% gain. If both price targets don’t get hit I gain a nice premium.
1855 2018-12-30 11:25:58 cremnob when you start talking about stocks i imagine you as that dude in the US who screams about stocks on network TV and has all those props
1856 2018-12-30 11:25:05 This is because he lies. He wants stocks to come back up so he can boast about his numbers. Pathetic.
1857 2018-12-30 11:23:00 I also like the looks of #SYM #BIOM and some of the UK bank stocks as brexit should spank them to bargain prices. Also some of the oil majors BP and Shell as divi plays.

1859 2018-12-30 11:21:51 Nice to read the lessons learned the hard way! I expected you also had some learnings, that’s why I asked. For rewards there’s always a risk. But mostly you write puts options on stocks you wouldn’t mind buying anyways?

1867 2018-12-30 11:08:18 Obama had the economy going great until you stepped in. Deficit. Stocks. Tariffs.
1868 2018-12-30 11:08:12 But now the markets have gone up for two days and I'm almost at the breakeven point again. It's been an immediate good lesson not to play around to much with expensive stocks as potentially you could get assigned for an amount of in this case $136*100.
1869 2018-12-30 11:06:45 hold some smaller positions in other stocks and trading has been ok this year but nothing to write home about. My main profits ( on paper ) are as a result of INFA , did pull some amazing baggers along the way with some total dogshit as well. Investments where the real gains are
1870 2018-12-30 11:04:29 Cause the imbalance was extremely skewed to stocks vs bonds
~4% AUM to buy in stocks
~1% AUM to sell in bonds

That 1% in bonds, is almost negligle size on fixed income market total volume

4% in stocks (~65% of that just in Sp500 names) was huge vs stock market volume
1871 2018-12-30 11:04:03 I,m in the same position as Spud, thanks again to Spud as bewteen his , @Asha231214 @rapidDave_uk research gave me confidence to invest to the  heavy side in #INFA , gamble you may ask ? All stocks are a gamble even blue chips but risk can be minmised #INFA has proved that 
1872 2018-12-30 11:01:59 I was just reading about stocks and shares ISA's on my laptop when my younger sister asked me, 

"are you working?"

She then walked over to look at my screen and said,

"oh - you're just doing boring stuff... for fun"

1877 2018-12-30 10:53:25 Oui il y a rupture fournisseur, alors vous avez rien trouvé de mieux que de vider les stocks en assumant pleinement que pour vous ce n'est pas vital car pas opéré. C'est très intelligent ! Vous pensez aux mecs post Hysté ?!
1878 2018-12-30 10:53:13 Joyce, I am VERY  2A..but Bump Stocks should outlawed. That psychotic SOB would never have been able to kill so many otherwise. Alas, the Left will always take a case N and expand to N+10million.
1879 2018-12-30 10:52:44 He'd like that. "I got the biggest crowd come see me in my stocks, so big. They told me - someone said, someone said to me that the biggliest tomatoes of all time got thrown. So much getting done, more than anyone in the stocks in history"
1880 2018-12-30 10:51:56 Good to see stocks like this setting larger degree bases and potentially setting higher lows
1881 2018-12-30 10:51:50 Bizarrely under-mentioned in much of the HMV talk is this snobbish attitude where people seem to think the shop only stocks major label releases. If they fold, indie labels will lose a main distributor, musicians will be hard hit & many related businesses will take a massive kick
1882 2018-12-30 10:46:11 Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee this as there is no current ending date for this offer. It is usually until stocks last. Sorry. -Tahmina
1883 2018-12-30 10:43:51 Congratulations mate . Been a rough year for a lot of us . Good to see a few people are winning . Certain stocks like infa saves a lot of people’s summers .

1886 2018-12-30 10:36:33 I sold nearly all my stocks a couple of months ago, I felt the market underestimated the global political risks. Moved much of it into crypto.
1887 2018-12-30 10:34:22 Ayos yan. Iwas lang muna sa stocks, kung di nga lang puro pula ang port ko sa PSE, bibitaw muna ako eh. Para iwas sa pagbagsak, karamihan pa man din ng investors sa PSE puro foreigners. Kaya siguradong damay ang PSE.

1891 2018-12-30 10:31:23 2019 could be the year of the underdogs, when the undervalued stocks bounce back. It is about time. The stocks you talk of are fully valued. Even HDFC is selling one of them to a Bandhar. Hahaha.
1892 2018-12-30 10:27:43 Higher yielding assets relative to bonds that could be considered riskier. So for example Gold, Silver considered "safe" have no yield they rose till the crashed. "High risk" stocks rose and never looked back. In the US. EU no as deficits were insufficient to drive up stock price

1899 2018-12-30 10:16:41 I still have 2 stocks
1900 2018-12-30 10:12:16 Oo, para mabilis ko mailipat sa stocks kapag kumita sa crypto sa 2019. Bargain hunting sa US stocks kapag nagkataon. hehehe
1901 2018-12-30 10:09:06 Crypto ka muna, hahaha! Masama ata ang stocks sa 2019, madadamay sa US. Balitang-balita ang US recession.

1905 2018-12-30 10:02:30 I think it is true. If you look at the chart. I was expecting up to $20/LB by end of year. We hit $37/LB which was way over reasonable and damaging for V growth. Likely stocks were held very low prior to changes and the upswing mostly related to new stock levels rather than usage

Another three or four were stocked over the year but have fallen by the wayside. We'll try to do a bit of analysis of this. What does it mean?

1922 2018-12-30 09:31:56 Since Obama was considered such a great president and he presided over the bailout of the financial industry. I think if the stock market starts to tank you should double if not triple the amount of money used for quantitative easing. So that stocks can be pushed even higher.

2. US-China trade negotiations will be beneficial for the market.

1962 2018-12-30 08:33:01 If interest rates are rising, why do savings accounts still earn next to nothing? 

Mortgage rates go up instantly. Credit card rates too. But the rates you earn on savings has been next to nothing. Why? They want you in bonds where the banks can manipulate market, or in stocks.
1963 2018-12-30 08:30:05 To add to your wisdom: buy the stocks now that are going up next week and next month. Kind of a modified Wimpy Burger approach. What could go wrong?

1966 2018-12-30 08:16:44 No its literally not. The stock market correction is due to stocks needing to fall short term in order to rise long term. The reason its big is because of how high the stocks were. Im sure hes also responsible the Global stock crssh too, right?
1967 2018-12-30 08:13:52 Fundamentally, this calls for a distribution of reward away from capital, to labour. Don't own stocks while this happens, if it takes place. Many populist leaders have no interest in this.

1990 2018-12-30 07:42:58 A few suggestions for investing long-term:
- Setup a Roth IRA via Vanguard.
- Consider using an app like Acorns to automatically invest into stocks, ETFs, notes, etc.
- Sign up to Robinhood to manually buy and sell stocks.

1992 2018-12-30 07:42:28 1. Short
2. Stock showing signs of topping out, more red candle days than green candles and declining volumes on green days 
3. Go short once stocks closes with strength candle below moving average (20dma)
4. Stop loss previous swing high
1993 2018-12-30 07:36:20 Yeah I like modeling and 3D stuff because I can really do whatever I want it’s like I have control of what I make and don’t have to rely on finding good stocks or something stupid like that to make a design but honestly I used to try to edit and still want to learn

1996 2018-12-30 07:32:34 we all gotta move onto shorting stocks to appease the need for stimulation via number autism
1997 2018-12-30 07:31:36 Ralph Wagner : " Stocks are a buy only if they are cheap but you can measure cheapness in two ways. One is in relation to a company's replacement cost, what it would take to replace it's assets. Or you can concentrate on the company's earnings growth prospects"
1998 2018-12-30 07:29:45 Because as a young entrepreneur i am always confused between the dichotomy of putting in my accrued profits in my own business or buying stocks
1999 2018-12-30 07:25:14 Better to buy stocks today itself.dont have much patience to wait in long queue tomorrow
2000 2018-12-30 07:25:12 For now, but wait until this coming year, you can’t write off anything , and no one I know has seen more money in the form of paychecks. Not enough to make a difference! Do you have stocks, I’d guess no, as he’s kept the Federal Interest rate from rising & its killing the market!
2001 2018-12-30 07:16:37 $SPX n markets.  Will be looking for a short here at this moment but will be looking for longer term longs (3 months or longer)in January.  Spx stocks above 50 Ema need to go above 40. Currently at 7.
2002 2018-12-30 07:16:26 Futures and stocks aren’t it. No one ever heard of a swap and a phone call?  Go do some work and look at off balance sheet. They’re there
2003 2018-12-30 07:15:20 I will be on the sideline when it comes to stocks for a while, first see how this plays out in the coming weeks. But I do see a nice r/r in bitcoin.
2004 2018-12-30 07:13:32 It would still be no where near as blunt as the truth of the matter . Many of those who take money from the public purse who have a duty of care want their heads slapping off them and put in stocks and publicly shamed .
2005 2018-12-30 07:11:50 Auto stocks will be in focus as the auto companies will start announcing  monthly sales numbers for December 2018 starting from 1 January 2019.
2006 2018-12-30 07:11:47 They have to say that ,so stocks won’t fall so deep that we find ourselves in another recession. All Republican Presidents are known for having the highest deficits and stock market crashes ! Then Democrats have to come in and clean up y’alls mess and get blamed for a bad economy
2007 2018-12-30 07:10:13 Graphite Stocks have lost 50% of their total gains in 2018. Best time to get in if the long term story is still intact.
It is the same situation last year end also. Is this a continuous loop?? #Stocks

2013 2018-12-30 06:58:28 Except that stocks and bonds actually provide an income stream, even if returns are as paltry as 4% over 40 yrs.  Bitcoin is speculative at best.  Just a year ago, it was trading at 20k and it’s down 85% since then.  Come on man
2014 2018-12-30 06:55:45 honestly the thing im the most glad about today is learning that my inkling isnt as bad as i thought it was

2019 2018-12-30 06:50:15 @realDonaldTrump Why don't you offer sound solutions to 1. Preexisting conditions, or 2. Lowering prescription drug prices, or 3. Bump stocks, high  capacity clips and gun show loophole in hopes of Dems buying into your asinine wall?

2033 2018-12-30 06:34:17 Stocks are stiil overvalued after 10yrs of QE. A recession is possible because the only thing keeping this economy afloat was the u even #Trump stimulus for the wealthy. That should start ending Jan3,2019 when fiscal gridlock begin. Fed is out of bullets!!

2059 2018-12-30 05:59:09 NVDA is a high flyer. I know that Cramer had named his dog after it. I remember it trading at 45$ a share and it took off like a rocket. Cramer moves the markets and I know he constantly highlighted it at the time it was going up. He does cause the pumping and dumping of stocks.

2106 2018-12-30 05:00:11 It is a sector worth tracking like other yield oriented sectors like REITs, MLPs, Consumer Staples etc. I personally think you get more bang for the buck with depressed consumer staples stocks right now. Utilities as an asset class only grow EPS at about 2% a year.
2107 2018-12-30 05:00:06 Overvalued at $7 IMHO.  Small N so far means very little and new NASH guidelines very bad for them.  These twitter cult stocks typically don’t work out often, but nevertheless good luck with the long journey and if it ever works out 3 years from now I’ll say I was wrong.
2108 2018-12-30 04:57:17 the only good part about seeing someone playing with 2 stocks on quickplay is that you know they're trash before the match starts
2109 2018-12-30 04:55:57 Let me just say one more thing about the stocks. An investment should be when you put money into something because you want to see whatever it is come to fruition, not because you want to profit off of hard working people. Putting money into something and expecting more...

2115 2018-12-30 04:50:57 This is a stupid ridiculous waste of time fight. Bump stocks are only good for putting massive numbeta of rounds down range. No one with any class or Talent would use one. This is the wrong fight at the wrong time.
2116 2018-12-30 04:50:21 Lack of clarity is big problem for beginners, they buy stocks for short-term, sometimes day trading, sometimes for long-term, sometimes even F&O.
2117 2018-12-30 04:47:47 I don't need to look at stocks to know that the game is plummeting, and whether or not a minority of people are enjoying the game is irrelevant, there will still people enjoying Pirates of the Burning Sea, Wildstar or Paragon the DAY the servers got shut down.
2118 2018-12-30 04:45:59 That shit should always be unlockable without microtransactions in a game that you pay premium price for. At one point, it was. But businesses dont need to make the money from cosmetics. They can still publish games and live amazing lives without, it's all a matter of stocks.
2119 2018-12-30 04:44:48 Not a great year for stocks. In fact, it was the worst December since 1931. So. Much. Winning.

And I know. You're probably going to look at stocks and pretend you know how they work to make a point (cuz that's popular right now). Don't bother.
2121 2018-12-30 04:43:32 haha supply and demand the basic of any market. Whether selling widgets, selling concert tickets or trading stocks
2122 2018-12-30 04:43:24 Most of the time passive investors not aware of quality stocks & invest based on the suggestions of  brokers & in bullish market they made some money (just coz of randomness) so they believe & invest.
2123 2018-12-30 04:41:34 That would be awesome, I'm hearing Pfizer has it's hands in this one. A monster is brewing here, this is the reason why I so love #Pharma stocks. They make big moves on a breakthrough drug or patents. Grand slam coming up here. $SOAN
2124 2018-12-30 04:40:56 Staples for Vegetarian Asian food:
- Gukganjang (soup soy sauce) - very useful for adding flavour to braised dishes. 
- Dashima / Kombu - vital for soup stocks, adds umami
- Shiitake - I add this into soup stocks as well. Not everyone likes mushrooms though
2125 2018-12-30 04:40:23 Bump stocks?  #sassywithmassie 

Btw, their homicide rate is much higher than the US and it will go down once they can sell a Brazilian guns.
2126 2018-12-30 04:40:07 #ES_F S&P 500 Index has 500 stocks and 500 options . ES future has one future and one Index option with huge liquidity in the entire global market ... That sends shock wave to its 500 stocks when #NQ_F dances ... with #VIX
2127 2018-12-30 04:38:46 Also I’m a millennial, I don’t have a 401k... im a college student trying to figure out my major based on my student debt I’ll owe. I don’t have medical stocks. I grew up with a single mom who didn’t invest. We just are trying to get by. Healthcare and school would help.
2128 2018-12-30 04:37:38 If anyone is into stocks the time is now to get into apple because that hoe is about to go up soon
2129 2018-12-30 04:37:11 I got a story for you to run @CTVChristina  ...

2131 2018-12-30 04:36:28 #Option never trade in stock options !! Stocks are getting screwed when Index futures screwed by big daddies . Then Index option screws ... If you deal with stock options , you are tearing $ currency note into two pieces .. Trade in Index future n its options to save coins
2132 2018-12-30 04:36:26 You seem to have a knack for pissing people off. Just stick to the stocks you have and stop attacking other stocks. Much less trouble in the long run. $PLS $AVZ
2133 2018-12-30 04:33:15 I think its a money laundering scheme. who cares if they donate their money. They cant donate any stocks gains bc they have all lost this year. its not tax deductible so they are really just screwing themselves. when it goes to the treasury, dems will have control over it. Haha
2134 2018-12-30 04:32:38 Bump Stocks are excessive for private citizens and pose a huge safety issue due to active shooters gaining an advantage against law enforcement and causing more casualties during mass shooting events. It is possible to support the 2nd Amendment w/o enabling active shooters...
2135 2018-12-30 04:31:28 Thanks a lot bro.
2136 2018-12-30 04:30:33 Hahahahaha dude for real, Ben and I stay talking about stocks at work too
2137 2018-12-30 04:30:17 Not really. Big money goes into bonds and stocks. Even derivative markets.
2138 2018-12-30 04:30:17 Bumper stocks?
2139 2018-12-30 04:29:42 Put another way, "bump stocks" were just redefined as machine guns. They were made after 1986 and not registered. There is no way to legally own one as it wasn't registered before 1986. There will be no path to legally own a bump stock. A pre-1986 legal machine gun is ~$20k +
2140 2018-12-30 04:28:43 Wouldn’t it better if one does not buy low quality stocks at the first place ??
2141 2018-12-30 04:28:42 but the stocks of DB is going down...Surprising. Isn't it?
2142 2018-12-30 04:27:16 TFW u win with 2 stocks in a 1 stock match
2143 2018-12-30 04:25:14 #option players are market makers . They don’t use Indicators. They hedge Option for stocks n futures . They short futures and buy *call option ( Short hedge) and buy futures and buy *put Option ( Long hedge ) . Sorry they silently sell call n put options always to make profit
2144 2018-12-30 04:23:42 DOs & DON'Ts Of Equity Investing:

Almost a year back,I told my friend to sell few poor quality stocks in his portfolio.

He said, they're in loss... sell only at my purchase price,Infact loss was just 5-6% at that time,now he's still holding at 50-60% loss.
2145 2018-12-30 04:17:48 Agreed then in a chat you get everyone’s opinion on stocks that don’t generate volume.  K.I.S.S. (Keep it simply stupid). I tell myself this all the time.
2146 2018-12-30 04:16:46 #Analysis for #Niftyfuture #BankNifty #Stocks #Commodities ............Now done
Still will take 2 hrs more for #Global Markets ,Forex Market
2147 2018-12-30 04:16:22 Theres things I dont like.  Banning bump stocks, middle class tax cuts should have been more.  Good thing I lost my bump stocks in a boating accident
2148 2018-12-30 04:15:16 Wrong assessment, Chinese technology stolen from . This why Trump threatened tariffs and has bipartisan support in Congress.  stocks mkt declined 25%. Please  compare U.S military, don’t misinformed #lka #Srilanka
2149 2018-12-30 04:12:06 Maybe he’ll talk about passing criminal justice reform or banning bump stocks. You know, something Obama didn’t do.
2150 2018-12-30 04:11:57 2019 im investing into stocks
2151 2018-12-30 04:11:52 Took time away the last 2 weeks from crypto/stocks to focus on myself: gym and tacos.

2153 2018-12-30 04:09:42 holden giving me those homie stocks on smash ultimate quickplay... i felt that in here 
2154 2018-12-30 04:07:21 @MikeCConTV will you give @realDonaldTrump credit for criminal justice reform or banning bump stocks? Obama did neither.
2155 2018-12-30 04:06:07 @M_Anthony86 @timothysykes @StocksToTrade
2156 2018-12-30 04:04:55 not everyone can "sell the family business" and put their money in the stock market.

that's a liberal myth.  what did he inherit and when?

when is the most important world in stocks. when is all that matters.

did he get $$$ in 1974? 1977? or 1999?  if you dont know, its smoke
2157 2018-12-30 04:04:29 Saying Netflix and Tesla are bad stocks to own from their inception. Wrong take
2158 2018-12-30 04:04:12 Yea, Trump is actually doing something about guns and criminal justice reform..unlike Obama. Why didn’t Obama do anything about bump stocks?
2159 2018-12-30 04:02:33 U.S. stocks are poised to end this year turning in their worst performance in a decade.  Factories closing.  Tax cut for rich exposed your priorities.
2160 2018-12-30 04:02:12 Unless we learn to control the radical rich & how they effect the political system, no politician can:

- take anything of value, money, trips, etc
- Transparent bank accounts & stocks before you serve
- Submit 5 years of income tax records

...then all of this is for nothing
2161 2018-12-30 04:01:09 Thank God we can't afford stocks...
2162 2018-12-30 04:00:59 And I can steal stocks with Up B 
2163 2018-12-30 04:00:01 Yeah when I play with someone and something truly out I nowhere and by complete deadly item RNG combination I’ll take one of my own stocks. xD
2164 2018-12-30 03:59:59 After exiting PNB Housing, most part of 2018, my pf has had just 4 stocks.

Bajaj Finance
Avenue Supermart
Gruh Finance
Page Industries

Expect not many changes to the pf in 2019.

All these showed great defense during Oct-Nov downturn. Let's see how these fare in the new year.
2165 2018-12-30 03:59:50 someone to blame for markets tanking.

(never mind that we're overdue for a recession.  and that the steroid tax cuts.)

ignore that a majority of folks don't own stocks.  trump has tied himself to markets and his cult45 needs a phrase to explain the "failure" (i.e., markets).
2166 2018-12-30 03:58:31 That episode of Friends when Monica got into buying stocks  “... the stock selling store”
2167 2018-12-30 03:58:17 How good it is learning how to trade stocks
2168 2018-12-30 03:58:07 Lifetime ISA is a no brainer. Especially if there is two of you, no cash ISA going to compete with it. Throw any surplus into a stocks and shares ISA. House prices will dip after Brexit even if it's only by remainers panic selling like in 2016. That's the time to strike.
2169 2018-12-30 03:56:01 On Wall Street, the great tech story of the year has been the crash in FAANG stocks. Down 30-40% from their highs. From indispensable, they've turned unwanted. Most fund managers plan to cut their FAANG holdings, even sell outright.
2170 2018-12-30 03:55:52 Hi! If by the time youre okay with purchasing it and its out of stock, pla message us privately then we’ll discuss  we wanted to try and manage stocks better this time so we’re capping orders in the meantime

2172 2018-12-30 03:54:37 Because every major country has a deficit because at one point its growth depended on that deficit? Look at America its debt is sold like stocks with its over 1 trillion dollars in debt. You think 19B is bad? I do not think you ever lived in a country where you couldn't 1/2
2173 2018-12-30 03:52:22 Please find the Presendential manual and read it. I'm not sure what work you are accomplishing. Except to cripple the American people with your trade wars, furlough federal employees, and cause our stocks go haywire. So much #winning

2175 2018-12-30 03:48:24 Been riding out the same stocks for most of the year, gonna put some more money in Robinhood and invest in some new ones to start the new year.
2176 2018-12-30 03:46:40 Hope they don't select portfolio stocks like this 
2177 2018-12-30 03:44:50 To be very fair.. he has huge capital to allocate and hence diversified with operating comp and stocks.. When u make investment decision he talks about long term, moat, concentration etc
.. he has never advocated against churn when you are wrong or when the stock is expensive...
2178 2018-12-30 03:44:37 big facts 
2179 2018-12-30 03:44:14 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2180 2018-12-30 03:44:05 If I could go back in time I'd tell my younger self what stocks to buy #Gutfeld
2181 2018-12-30 03:43:52 I meant trading options (buying calls and placing puts) I like trading stocks a lot more, same here! Loaded up for 2019, $ROKU is my big fish!

2183 2018-12-30 03:43:10 Will drop by up town center later uwu i'll visit the saem there hhhhhh i'll also check the stocks of some products :>
2184 2018-12-30 03:42:39 Not necessarily. I think a break of $30 on the spot market will get quite a bit of financial press and create significant buying interest in uranium stocks. Not sure if they will break recent highs but should at least get close to them and ready for another leg on higher terms
2185 2018-12-30 03:41:14 all I said...was underrated tweet and this shit happen LOOOLL

2189 2018-12-30 03:37:55 I don’t know what you say. The stocks are cheap.  Anyone bought them last week will be likely getting at least 10% gain in coming year
2190 2018-12-30 03:37:03 Matt can you share how you scan for the stocks on your watchlist too?  And are your scans from only using TDAmeritrade scans or do you use FInviz too?  I too am in TC and would love to learn from your humbleness and humanity.
2191 2018-12-30 03:36:53 Tan sencillo como que te tiras tus stocks y busques algo nuevo
2192 2018-12-30 03:36:30 That's dumbest tweet today... you just gave $1.5 trillion in handouts to corporations who bought stocks AT PEAK PRICES and then the market dropped $2 trillion erasing that value.  No wall.  No Trump.  GOP is gone.  All that's left is the Trump Party.
2193 2018-12-30 03:32:29 Prior to this sell off the last couple of weeks, Not sure what metric you’re using but  I would not say stocks were cheap, and still are not cheap
2194 2018-12-30 03:32:06 Exactly so your stocks suppose to be full
2195 2018-12-30 03:31:12 So where do you think the Stock Market is headed next week?

2200 2018-12-30 03:23:32 She found it a tad hot on her tropical Hawaiian vacation. Real reason is her investor husband has gone all in on global warming stocks in largest insider trading deal ever. @NancyPelosi is corrupt
2201 2018-12-30 03:23:07 I hate to tell you this, you can act like your stocks didn’t tank and maybe die hard Trump f ollowers will believe you but you are full of shit.

2203 2018-12-30 03:21:54 Off topic, and maybe this has been covered...

2207 2018-12-30 03:16:18 Republicans are in charge right now...you fools are responsible for the border deaths, the government shutdown & the tax break for the richest 1%! You lied to your base! They are getting the shaft! No pay raises! Companies are buying back stocks especially now with stocks down!
2208 2018-12-30 03:16:10 @ImranKhanPTI why you hold stocks market policy as you committed to offer stock market policy before year close @Asad_Umar
2209 2018-12-30 03:15:22 Hopefully he's working hard to shorten the length of time we have to put up with this administration...

On another topic.  You probably don't get to see it, but how weird is it that our former speaker of the house John Bainer is hocking marajuana stocks now...
2210 2018-12-30 03:15:03 “We’re stocks away from an all tristate top 3. Yes we’re claiming tweek, and there’s nothing you can do about it” that’s facts

2221 2018-12-30 03:08:25 A V might cause him to raise. That is the fear. He has a hard-on for stocks. That was clear way back. I suspect he wants to re-load that gun too. But then stocks even more manipulated policy tool.

2225 2018-12-30 03:05:43 5 time bankruptcy, grade B actor,  lied and mislead in over 800 statements, the biggest drop in a week in stocks in a decade, Korea footage of Kim still building weapons,  70% of world species gone-energy,  97% of world climate scientists agree caused by humans. Sucks. Really.
2226 2018-12-30 03:04:20 Sis who are you to talk to my friends like that
2227 2018-12-30 03:04:17 I stand here making microcosms, well aware that that is the only way for currentivism to really function. A person can only pay attention to about twenty stocks, at a time of course.
2228 2018-12-30 03:04:16 Not really yall seem like y’all need some good dick cause what y’all getting doesn’t seem to be pleasing y’all 
2229 2018-12-30 03:04:13 But, ERP is positive, curve is positive, absolute level of front end is low, employment low but so is inflation. So outside of stocks what is it. Global is down, but US usually leads recession not other way around.
2230 2018-12-30 03:02:46 Well for cannabis stocks if you bought on December 2017 or early January 18 then maybe you are down a lot

2237 2018-12-30 02:54:07 Almost every major online retailer stocks these self defense rounds. They are very good and perform well IMO.
2238 2018-12-30 02:54:03 Buy stocks with your free money NOW... buy gold and silver weekly... never smoke cigarettes... and watch out for women on this list... they are trouble. :)
2239 2018-12-30 02:53:04 That’s fair. I thought your RTs were endorsements of what he was saying and I was concerned. 

I wish he’d stop tweeting bs and messing up my stocks.

2242 2018-12-30 02:49:56 The Democrates need lower wage workers, so companies and share holders can make more money, like the Democrates buy into stocks because they know more about inside trading. Thats why they live in  15 million dollar homes...w/A Wall around it. They make a salary of $174.000 yr. ??

2250 2018-12-30 02:45:57 Stocks need to show consistency going forward. Those that do will sell @14.5x , those that out perform will do better than that. Those that don't measure up will continue to be sold.
2251 2018-12-30 02:45:39 True.  FT associates no longer get free stocks, going forward. But w/no guaranteed value, really, we only lost the possibility of $$$   Going forward, FT associates will receive lump sum cash awards for milestone achievements.  (I like cash. ALOT)
2252 2018-12-30 02:43:34 apple stocks rise by 30%.
2253 2018-12-30 02:43:23 In 2008 financial crisis also he sold his cheap looking stocks to buy even cheaper stocks from markets ... he does that kind of stuff all the time, Recent correction might have given same opportunity to him.
2254 2018-12-30 02:42:52 Unemployment all time low especially for African Americans, GDP up, jobs flowing back, cut regulations Obama had in place that was suffocating sm businesses, record highs the past 2yrs in stocks, POW’s brought home, Korea peace talks,better insurance for vets, many more...
2255 2018-12-30 02:41:50 I think democrats should look to see if Trump told the treasury to buy stocks to prop up the markets. I dont know why but i get the vibes he did that and it not right
2256 2018-12-30 02:39:40 If we dont have stocks in domestic cricket (average/performance wise)the next best bet is to pick on potential (e.g. 19 year old Cummins in 2011). The kids either perform and nail down a spot for 10-15 yrs, or discover flaws but have time and youth on their side to eliminate them
2257 2018-12-30 02:39:27 Like I get if you a street nigga and got a AK cuz opps, but I can’t imagine why my ass needs to bust 7.62s at anybody. 

Like I have a 401k....nigga I got stocks and shit I don’t need that big bitch I got a presentation tomorrow.
2258 2018-12-30 02:38:21 Master your setup. Master yourself. #stocks
2259 2018-12-30 02:35:45 That's the thing. Russophobic victims of propaganda have sold their valuable integrity to buy vast shares in a stock that hasn't even gone public yet. And now they're whining because their estimated windfall appears to have dwindled down to penny stocks. Capitalism is murder.
2260 2018-12-30 02:35:41 Why not just make the whites all stand in the back? Better yet, put them in stocks, they'll probably like that.
2261 2018-12-30 02:35:31 Do they make bump-stocks for the pecker?

*Asking for a hooded druid...
2262 2018-12-30 02:35:28 Did he get that out before the biggest drop in stocks since the recession. In a decade...
2263 2018-12-30 02:34:31 2019 is my year to learn how to save more and invest into stocks for my future.
2264 2018-12-30 02:32:49 When Victoria's Secrets stocks & sales go down due to this campaign then it'll be an OVERING, cause these ladies refused to put some covering
2265 2018-12-30 02:32:29 I say we go back to the early 17th century where the put liars in stocks in the village Square with signs hanging around their neck to shame them. Trump would have developed a hump by now
2266 2018-12-30 02:32:05 Don’t buy stocks now!! Peak economy
2267 2018-12-30 02:31:11 @IngrahamAngle They will crush #StockMarket
 the huge market change is from the rich buying all the stocks that were sold for 1$  dollar..
2268 2018-12-30 02:30:54 Sports gambling is exactly like the stocks market trading. Find a few things that work and stick to them.  Notre Dame and Michigan don’t show up in big games and Alabama never loses.  Nice pay day.  See you next year.
2269 2018-12-30 02:27:24 every time I’m even a little high i think about getting into stocks
2270 2018-12-30 02:27:19 Wait till they reverse split their shares, like voted on - 
Like their products, hate their execution and s.p and would not be holding on imo. 
There are better stocks out there!

2275 2018-12-30 02:20:19 Little known fact: there’s a three day waiting period and a required background check for dildos in AZ. Bump stocks on dildos are legal though.

2279 2018-12-30 02:15:33 Literally no. Camping is much more efficient. There's a timer, and when the time runs out the person with more stocks wins. It's literally more efficient to gain the lead and avoid confrontation than to risk getting punished. That is why campy stages get banned.

2281 2018-12-30 02:13:11 Wells Fargo purchased $64 billion worth of stocks, according to one report on Facebook. The market isn't suddenly healthy and the bankrupt casino owner isn't suddenly an economic expert .In the two GOP tax bills, corporations and households  received $8 trillion
2282 2018-12-30 02:12:41 I love finding no hazards three minutes no stocks when I play elite smash
2283 2018-12-30 02:11:40 Lest anyone misinterpret my point of view, outlawing bump stocks is one of the extremely few Trump promises I support. I suspect they did this in a purposely ineffective way.

2297 2018-12-30 01:53:47 Lol. Under obama, market went from 14K-18K in 8 years. Trump economy market went from 18K-26k in 1 year. Retirees shouldn't be in all stocks to begin with. 
Article should read...retirees winning as fed increases rates. Rates under barack were at 0 which hurt retirees

2303 2018-12-30 01:47:29 Not sure how much Trump helped stocks with his comments, to me rebound seemed purely technical, buy programs triggered precisely at the 200 wma, but hey, any help in this correction is welcomed

2305 2018-12-30 01:46:44 . The TSE has badly underperformed the Dow, Nasdaq and basically every other market. Canadian stocks are a mess and bond rates are abysmal. Show me how that’s a win
2306 2018-12-30 01:46:04 BEFORE YOU FUCKING WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT BUMP STOCKS YOU NEED TO HAVE THE FACTS, UNLESS YOU JUST SHIT OUT FAKE NEWS, I CAN FIRE MY AR JUST AS FAST, WITH OR WITHOUT A BUMP STOCK.  STOP THE SHIT.
2307 2018-12-30 01:46:00 i think she shouldn't have done that considering the palette comes out in limited stocks meaning limited people can receive it. she should have waited until the hype surrounding the palette died down. BUT, i do also believe it is her money, her palette, and your coin.

2311 2018-12-30 01:35:58 TWN Stocks: Recently IPO'd Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank (5876 上海商銀) has been on a hot streak since Oct. 19 and is up 10%.   But it is Shanghai in name only, since it has no presence in Shanghai (where it was founded in 1915), or anywhere else in China.
2312 2018-12-30 01:33:40 Has anyone asked middle income Europeans who typically don't own stocks how they feel about this? Maybe they're getting trickled down on so much they're drowning and the chart just doesn't grow.
2313 2018-12-30 01:29:46 And the Trump administration banned Bump Stocks. If you aren't at all concerned about this order, go ask the victims of Post Katrina how they felt when they were forced to turn in their guns.
2314 2018-12-30 01:28:01 Aelita: I had two stocks left. :)
2315 2018-12-30 01:26:35 I, for one, look forward to buying stocks on margin.

2323 2018-12-30 01:22:31 Housing crisis is particularly acute as it was exacerbated by #IIP immigration policy which brought in crooks from dictatorial regimes who needed 2 hide their assets away & chose our homes as their deposit boxes that later could be traded among themselves as penny stocks. #bcpoli

2328 2018-12-30 01:14:08 @NRA Is the NRA joining the lawsuit(s) on bump stocks?  I have seen no indication that the NRA is involved with getting the ATF ruling overturned.  If not, why not?
2329 2018-12-30 01:11:16 This game has so many stocks on full display and I'm here for it.

2333 2018-12-30 01:09:27 Australia's gun ban was an utter failure. After 20 years, the gov't admits there are still tens of thousands of illegal guns on the streets. Further, there are more guns in private hands today than in 1997. Same here. People ignore bans on bump stocks & high capacity magazines.
2334 2018-12-30 01:08:03 But no bump stocks on the dildoes.
2335 2018-12-30 01:04:59 Incremental buys 

Buy the base on fundamental or hype looking stocks, add only on strength.

Sell baggers period 

Take a hit on breaking support, since i only add on strength, losses have been minimal
2336 2018-12-30 01:02:38 A HUGE thank you for all who wrote to me today and did something positive for someone. I have been reading emails all day,  and I gave away nearly ONE THOUSAND, yes you read that right! ONE THOUSAND copies of  "Get Paid Upfront to Trade Stocks." Now! Go Rip This Markets Face Off!
2337 2018-12-30 01:02:04 "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau." - Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics, Yale University, 1929.
2338 2018-12-30 01:01:59 Not necessarily. Trump trying to control narrative after damage done. Meanwhile, Foxconn deciding to move some production to India says alot about difficulties encountered in finance and commerce. I expect US stocks to bounce around in a widow maker range for a while.
2339 2018-12-30 01:01:38 My goal for 2019 is to get more serious about stocks
2340 2018-12-30 01:00:49 Conclusions that some institutions should go passive may be right, but incorrect returns / benchmark isn’t a major analytical flaw to you? Should RWM clients judge your firm by looking at their actual returns less 2% vs US stocks + long bonds when beta + duration outperforms?
2341 2018-12-30 00:59:43 in hindsight if henry was fully incorporated into sj back in the day i would also buy stocks to kick him out

2348 2018-12-30 00:57:21 it is truly a shame that the August and Noble Foot-Ball Programs Michigan and Notre Dame spent their bowl games getting paraded around the stadiums in medieval stocks while jim harbaugh and brian kelly swelled up like the wind guy in big trouble in little china on the sidelines
2349 2018-12-30 00:56:42 I cleaned my entire apartment today and I feel SO ACCOMPLISHED. Like, I've been such an adult this last month its insane. Who am I anymore? I feel like I need to buy stocks or something
2350 2018-12-30 00:56:00 I stay away buying their stocks but bought Asia concentrated CEFs.

2352 2018-12-30 00:53:21 Emerging markets and technology stocks have been over promised and are often over valued. The stock market needs to realign after 10 years of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates at 0 with quantitative easing that subsidized the economy during all of the Obama years.

2357 2018-12-30 00:49:27 Probably not, but there is an absence of any quality to batting stocks in Australian cricket so these types of discussions will continue until something real emerges. #AUSvsIND

2359 2018-12-30 00:48:44 People in MA are America's biggest #lottery spenders.  The average #lottery spend PER ADULT was $977.71 in 2016.  If they invested in stocks instead, they would have had a not-too-shabby $1,329.68 at the end of 2017.  And that's for EVERY person!!
2360 2018-12-30 00:48:36 Stocks. Many many stocks.
2361 2018-12-30 00:47:20 @Weissbluth The problem with so called investors (who should not be in the first place) they buy stocks blindly just because there is a name out there, like brand products. Fundamental is the basis. When you buy stocks you are buying into that company which is on a sound footing.
2362 2018-12-30 00:47:18 He says “overinflated?” SP500 forward PE is now at 14. Stocks here are cheap, cheap, cheap. If you’re not buying now, you’ll miss the pop.
2363 2018-12-30 00:46:54 Oh yeah I just meant in between stocks, instead of immediately spawning I chilled and breathed for a sec
2364 2018-12-30 00:43:37 I wasnt talking about only stocks. From a business perspective you would be well off and stress free having some start up capital than just borrowing. Coming around to my point is from a person with bad credit or no credit is next to impossible.
2365 2018-12-30 00:43:26 I thought only the rich had money in the stock market, according to liberals. The liberal media cheers the stock market falling because they want trump to fail. Economy is fundamentally excellent and stocks will recover back to 25k on Dow Jones, which is up 45% since 2016.
2366 2018-12-30 00:43:00 Ita.  I can't wait to see what Monday will bring, being the last business day of 2018.

The stocks will go down again.

The shutdown will continue w/no end in sight.

Many Federal workers will have to choose between food and bills, or rent and gas for their cars.

2367 2018-12-30 00:39:48 Really quite cross about @guardian piece by Penny Anderson on @hmvtweets I visit #HMV almost every week, I refuse to shop online, it stocks most if not all of what I want and there are no alternatives near us. The piece is not worthy of publication in a national paper IMHO
2368 2018-12-30 00:39:47 The best predictor of future stock returns is the addition of corporate profit growth plus dividends.  Changes in P/E are due to short-term speculative changes.  We buy stocks largely for future dividend streams.
2369 2018-12-30 00:39:33 A FIRST FOR EVERYTHING

The S&P Index has been around since 1923 (with 500 stocks since 1957).

In all that time, December has NEVER ONCE been the worst month of a calendar year.

If $SPX closes on Monday below 2568.61, 2018 will be the first year EVER to do so.

2373 2018-12-30 00:34:29 Any hot stocks?
2374 2018-12-30 00:34:00 Odd, I’d say turning a surplus from the Liberals into multiple deficits and losing billions on sale of the GM stocks would be incompetent.
2375 2018-12-30 00:33:54 Ok ppl, until he replies back, what do you think suck really means?

I'll go out on a limb and say he stocks water and a sock
2376 2018-12-30 00:33:38 Big 3 cant be big 3 w/o their hardworking artists providing the revenue & stocks to make them the big 3
2377 2018-12-30 00:33:06 Investing in stocks really doesn’t sound too damn bad. Might slowly start getting into it.
2378 2018-12-30 00:33:05 I’d be interested in how companies perform over 5 and 10+ year periods. Do the stocks even keep up with the market or do long term buybacks provide a sell signal for returns. (IBM, Exxon, HP, Freeport)
2379 2018-12-30 00:30:13 Ban bump stocks and more security guards in schools
2380 2018-12-30 00:30:06 Sell your stocks
2381 2018-12-30 00:29:20 Low float penny stocks do these kind of issues (obvisouly ar much lower valuations and amounts) all the time. Dangle a growth oriented use of proceeds and retail will eat it up.
2382 2018-12-30 00:28:57 im doing Marth vs Roy 99 stocks
2383 2018-12-30 00:28:24 I’m not here for reverences I’m here for rising EUR Long rates and recovering stocks
2384 2018-12-30 00:27:44 Stocks are like dreams. They're all nightmares
2385 2018-12-30 00:27:04 You’re out of your mind. Just stop with the f king koolaid ok. The deficit is out of control, stocks are on the decline,farmers need bailouts, companies are leaving the country, 15000 children kidnapped, several dying oh HIS watch. Just STOP.
2386 2018-12-30 00:26:45 Good idea.
2387 2018-12-30 00:26:13 Stocks with RSI >70 screen down to just 6. Last week was 13. Few months ago there were hundreds $SPY $QQQ
2388 2018-12-30 00:26:12 it might be with 3 stocks it can require more set stamina
2389 2018-12-30 00:25:23 Waiting for Jack to follow suit...
2390 2018-12-30 00:24:55 @NintendoAmerica why did i get disconnected when a kirby stalled out on the ledge and your game warned me that i was being unsportsmanlike? It said canceled and told me this after i was three stocks to kirbys one stock. I stayed safe and used my light shuriken until he came up.
2391 2018-12-30 00:23:48 Hey - just like some of the stocks I dumped year-end. 
2392 2018-12-30 00:22:22 Hey Notre Dame.. y'all high school. Join a conference ro get respect. Y'all suck. Laughing stocks.

2394 2018-12-30 00:19:29 I’d invest in stocks with it. I’d watch it thrive.
2395 2018-12-30 00:18:52 131 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.

私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
2396 2018-12-30 00:14:37 Either way I know how this conversation goes and it gets no where. Good talk though. Make sure if you have any bump stocks you gets those turned into the government before the thin blue line comes and takes them from you- courtesy of trump. Thanks!
2397 2018-12-30 00:12:44 Why, even with that recent drop the  crypto markets still seem a lot more stable than the stocks.
2398 2018-12-30 00:11:32 OOOH! Were there any stocks there??? 
2399 2018-12-30 00:10:46 I wanna learn stocks and just sit at home and make money
2400 2018-12-30 00:09:23 I swear to god some match ups in Ultimate make the game look like it could be 4 stocks while others make it look like 2 stocks lol
2401 2018-12-30 00:08:30 THIS JUST IN: WERE GETTING CONFIRMATION THIS IS A SOURCE PICK 

WE SIMPLY DO NOT MISS THESE!

MY SOURCE PICKS ARE BETTER THAN STOCKS HITTING WITH AN UNBELIEVABLE ROI 

LETS CASH THIS AND GET A RT/SHOUT OUT TO 3 AMIGOS CASH LOCKS

2402 2018-12-30 00:07:40 You sure as hell don't take responsibility for anything. The stocks dropping, companies leaving the  country, caging children and 3 shutdowns by YOU!
2403 2018-12-30 00:07:19 Growth forecasts slashed... LOL Buy more stocks idiots!
2404 2018-12-30 00:06:38 People are not obeying that law. Look at the actual stats of bump stocks being turned in. Everyone knows what up as is ignoring the ban.
2405 2018-12-30 00:04:17 Analiza sus gráficos, el análisis técnico te ayudará a comprar en momentos precisos y te dirá si el precio de la acción es acordé al valor de la empresa. Los stocks le reflejan, pero la oferta y demanda define el precio actual... Lo que vez en el mercado es PÁNICO.
2406 2018-12-30 00:01:55 Lost a set because hazards was on and we had to restart while I was up 3 stocks to 2 at 12%.
2407 2018-12-30 00:01:53 Buy stocks early Monday morning.
2408 2018-12-30 00:01:52 After I received my long service medal in a brown envelope that had been left in my tray, I would often brace myself and suppress my excitement when opening even larger subsequent envelopes. Alas QPM no longer a possibility... Keep an eye on brown envelope stocks.

2443 2018-12-29 23:47:21 TWN Stocks: Mercuries Life (2867 三商壽) December secondary was for 150MM shares priced at $11.30.   Hence, $11.30 should be your entry point.   Point of exit?   $14.30 (its previous all-time low).
2444 2018-12-29 23:47:11 1/ Just a student of Narrative when it comes to stocks that defy fundamentals. I hear you and don’t disagree at all. I also have dialogues with these insto managers you refer to. They love getting personal phone calls from Elon. It’s like getting a call from god.

2446 2018-12-29 23:45:33 INFORMATION ON SHORTING STOCKS:   There are many Exchange Traded Funds that you can buy that increase in value (price) if the stock market declines.
2447 2018-12-29 23:44:44 Went as seeded, barely didn't make it out of pools :( lot of my stocks were unfortunate but it's week 3. Learning and running with it
2448 2018-12-29 23:43:37 TWN Stocks: Mercuries Life (2867 三商壽) is really a shit company who never rewarded its shareholders with cash dividends (always via share dividends).   However, after last Friday's plunge to close at $11.65, I'd rate it a trading buy.  Go for it!
2449 2018-12-29 23:43:36 stocks rise by 1%.
2450 2018-12-29 23:43:06 If ten years ago there had been a fiscal stimulus to these areas .. but people know in their gut now that it is too late for tinkering. They may not know the details of govt policy of house price inflation and QE (stocks and shares inflation), but they know they've been diddled.
2451 2018-12-29 23:43:02 I’m a liberal gun owner. We are NOT anti 2A. We ARE advocates of common sense gun laws, gun safety, stricter and more thorough background checks, and realistically opposed to bump stocks, semi automatic rifles.
2452 2018-12-29 23:42:48 Probably on the stocks and someone tipped them the wink.

2457 2018-12-29 23:39:43 TWN Stocks:  Mercuries Life (2867 三商壽) has had it head handed back on a platter. I was extraordinarily lucky to have gotten out of this dog in the $16's (with a small profit) - before it went ex-dividend and plunged,and then plunged some more on news of its secondary issuance.

2462 2018-12-29 23:36:39 I'm of two minds on bump stocks. A sling is far more necessary for a rifle, and, in my view, bump stocks are mostly a wasteful novelty. I just don't think that the president has the proper authority to ban them. That sort of legislative authority isn't mentioned in article I.

2468 2018-12-29 23:30:23 You must have stocks in Fox News. Do you remember the fox in the hen house story. I think I know who that is and it’s not me. Orange is the color and it lives in a White House.

2479 2018-12-29 23:23:26 Today I learned that in America, you can literally invest money in prisons and correctional facilities.

American Prison Companies are listed on the stock market under REIT's.

One example is:
Corecivic Inc (CXW) on the NYSE.

That is so strange.

2480 2018-12-29 23:22:52 I don’t think Crypto and Stocks comparison is fair. Crypto has long way to go before it’s considered investable for majority of population. And if u wanted to compare the drop, a percentage comparison would be more apt.
2481 2018-12-29 23:21:26 Job growth stalled. Wages declining. 800,000 civil servants furloughed. Farmers on welfare. Stocks worst since Great Depression. Consumer confidence tanking. Debt exploding

2482 2018-12-29 23:20:09 Problem is the apparent disjuncture between value produced and reward given. Salaries are like stocks /assets that rocket upwards regardless of fundamentals, P/E etc
2483 2018-12-29 23:19:50 You invest in individual stocks or funds/ETF?

2488 2018-12-29 23:15:01 Going into 2019 I am big on platform coins, privacy coins, and TPS/scalability coins, specifically sharding. I am big on the cannabis market or pot stocks. As well as the electrical vehicle market. Invest long term and have a strategy.

2492 2018-12-29 23:12:22 Do u get good fills on your trades and how long have you been using them? Yes please send me the promo. So if I pay 40 bucks a month I can trade unlimited stocks and options irrelevant to the number of shares or contracts right ?
2493 2018-12-29 23:12:12 You really think players would rather sit out and prepare for the NFL instead of competing for a national title?  
And they have a huge opportunity to boost their draft stocks at the same time....
If this is the case, we should start to see players in the top 4 sit out soon too??

2499 2018-12-29 23:06:22 Tell me about the movement before the 6K drooped.... I feel like I went from 35 to 80 yo. And let’s not even talk about regular stocks. From $5 to $8 in 29 years 
2500 2018-12-29 23:05:39 What are your thoughts on Chinese tech stocks like BABA, BIDU, JD, CTRP for 2019? Thanks!
2501 2018-12-29 23:03:03 I just saw a movie on the importance of financial record keeping both for stocks and for bank accounts.. I wonder if I can get CLE credit for it.

2503 2018-12-29 23:02:15 Today there is little evidence in News, Stocks and Home for how a crossover UI design might work well. Looking forward if an iOS/UIKit app could utilise the UI conventions that make Mac apps work well, with the keyboard, mouse and window paradigm, then I don’t see a downside.
2504 2018-12-29 23:01:42 More suited to the stocks.
2505 2018-12-29 23:01:36 Good eve snipe. You often use specific stocks as hedges esp on downside. Amazon and NVDA are common. Why these or what are your favourite down side hedges. Thanks.  Abe

2508 2018-12-29 23:00:49 “One bad game”? He’s renowned for struggling in big games he’s played in. The transfer he made hasn’t helped his draft stocks at all. The same questions remain, along with those terrible throwing mechanics. Go and put me back on mute you coward

2511 2018-12-29 22:58:42 If balance sheets are so good then why you keep crying all day! Fed is not responsible for your stocks to go up. If your stocks are so good why you need Fed to buy them from you at higher price? Admit you are a loser and don't know how to analyze markets.
2512 2018-12-29 22:57:29 Cashing in on the meme before the new year... smart. Gotta sell while the stocks are high.

2518 2018-12-29 22:54:58 Exactly. Everyday @jimcramer comes up with some new excuse to justify his losing stocks and fool people! Glad I never watched his show!

2520 2018-12-29 22:52:46 Right, ban bump stocks means gun confiscation!

Remember when Obama was coming for all your guns?

Lunacy
2521 2018-12-29 22:52:02 People with bump stocks won't destroy them or hand them over, so if you know someone with a bump stock, call it in to the police.
2522 2018-12-29 22:51:59 My father used to pick up a case of beer everyday the owner of the liquor store saved the newspaper for me so I could check the stocks. My father and I would discuss why things were valued that. On the way home we would do math problems I’m talking at like the age of 4
2523 2018-12-29 22:50:32 Writing a novel, so sort of like researching stocks
2524 2018-12-29 22:50:13 Tbh one of the greatest gifts I received As a child was stocks and bonds. It taught me a lot about the market at an early age.
2525 2018-12-29 22:49:02 Not just the Federal Reserve though. Should include all of the Globalist Cabal selling off stocks in preparation for their flight from prosecution.
2526 2018-12-29 22:48:50 I thought of this stock selling shit the other day when it dropped. I know nothing about stocks and wall street. But my mind couldn't get away from insider trading. What say you?
2527 2018-12-29 22:48:34 Inflation wiped out wage gains, folks are working 3 part-time jobs with no benefits, if there’s a low unemployment rate it’s b/c folks have run out of unemployment benefits. And the corporations didn’t create new jobs w/ the #GOPtaxScam, they used it to buy back their own stocks.

2530 2018-12-29 22:47:03 Another limited release... another bot-friendly release lol... why @nikestore  dont produce enough stocks for every sneakerhead
2531 2018-12-29 22:46:43 The pain we felt this year often happens before the big boom. Like with Amazon and Google stocks 

2017 was just a test pump 
2532 2018-12-29 22:46:31 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your depression
2533 2018-12-29 22:45:12 And CSE stocks are not marginable so you would also lose the leveraged investors.
2534 2018-12-29 22:44:11 Your wealthfare only helped the high ups & big business owners like yourself.  They’ve invested in their own stocks.  Not their workers. The only trickling down is the hard working people getting pissed on by the wealthy.  #ImpeachTrumpNow #TrumpIsAMoron #TrumpIsNotAboveTheLaw
2535 2018-12-29 22:44:01 Bump fire stocks are now illegal unconstitutionally. The law says it creates an automatic weapon. Which is compleatly wrong.

An automatic it needs one pull of the trigger to fire numerous times.

The bump stock only enables quicker trigger pulling.
2536 2018-12-29 22:43:05 @PoliticsNation Why do RW Politicians ignore Americans who don't own Stocks
2537 2018-12-29 22:42:43 Yes, up until 2019 where the restructuring is now completed and distribution growth resumes.  Equity income needs growth to deliver double digit returns to compensate for equity risk.  MLPs have not grown distributions since the 2014 oil crash so have been unattractive. #Stocks

2542 2018-12-29 22:36:39 Trumps a tyrant and most people have agreed to keep their bump stocks anyways
2543 2018-12-29 22:36:35 Gunny - depending on when you’re going to need it, the market is the best place to be!  Your time horizon is key. 3 yrs? 5? 7? You may want to have your investment mix reviewed by a professional planner.  All stocks or all bonds are not the way to go. 60/40 50/50 40/60? JMO!!
2544 2018-12-29 22:36:12 It's my understanding that the NRA doesn't oppose the bump stock ban because none of the firearms manufacturers on their board of directors produces bump stocks.
2545 2018-12-29 22:35:25 Production volumes are still strong, all pipelines are all full and transportation rates are very high.  Oil prices in the $40-50 range will reduce the growth of US production but not result in an absolute decline.We expect MLPs to grow distributions by over 6% this year. #Stocks

2553 2018-12-29 22:28:52 I think we need to start shield earlier, start it up north you can start August. Introduce more teams in shield, our batting stocks have a real problem with occupying the crease. More teams, some better some worse will help both bowling and batting I believe.
2554 2018-12-29 22:28:08 I don't accept your definition that you have to accept money to not be a promoter. He took a position in the stock and immediately promoted it with gusto and the way stock promoters promote stocks. Only worse.

2572 2018-12-29 22:12:40 Except skip the buy-out part. Investing is a gamble. We all know stocks could become worthless. There's no guarantee any biz will be profitable forever. Taxpayers have no obligation to prop up their failures. They failed to adapt to climate damage they long knew about. Too bad.

2579 2018-12-29 22:08:02 I thought the Democrats owned GM now since Obama bought it with our tax dollars and took our stock to 0$ and caused some of us to loose money meantime Ford paid back and stocks went up???
2580 2018-12-29 22:05:24 Will that latest trump tweet regarding the ‘good conversation’ about the tradewar have any effect on the stockmarkets coming days ? I’m still figuring out how this type of news affect stocks in a bearish scenario.
2581 2018-12-29 22:04:45 Is a treasury share a “form of debt” that factors into valuation after the shares are lessened gradually in the market (to narrate pump stocks while hiding a liability), even if it is buying/(creating treasury shares) with cash flow/(not servicing debt)
2582 2018-12-29 22:04:16 Yes, you buy and sell like any other stock. There's a pattern to when the stocks rise and fall and if you use the pending purchase bit on the app I'm using you can dictate at what stock point you buy without having to keep constant eye

2587 2018-12-29 21:59:57 I'm as mentally prepared for the next RISE in cannabis stocks, as for the recent slide down. It will be tough to HOLD when there are 10%, 40%, 70%, 200% gains, same as it was on the way down.

2604 2018-12-29 21:47:40 $SQ,$NFLX, $BA  these stocks like most have H&S formations that measure to lower prices.  People with charts nevertheless arguing bottoms
2605 2018-12-29 21:47:21 How about cut the risk out (individual names/stocks) since its your child's education fund and split the money up into ETFs. Like SPY, QQQ, IBB, IWM, USO. Also instead of just diving in why not buy it up in tiers. Start with say 30% now and add 15%-20% over the next 3-4 years.
2606 2018-12-29 21:46:53 I think we can learn. I learnt about TD e funds last year. This year I plan to buy stocks. Mind you the downward dog of the stock market is slightly disruptive but there you go. In every cycle a bit of downward dog happens.
2607 2018-12-29 21:41:50 Recognizing that all assets listed on coinmarketcap are penny stocks isn't maximalism. It's just common sense. And it has nothing to do with appreciating Bitcoin's properties.

It's just what they are. They're small-cap unregistered securities. It's allowed. Just not interesting
2608 2018-12-29 21:40:43 I’d like to think he issued the EO (popular with anti-2A crowd) with thought/advise that the courts would throw it out since bump stocks are an accessory and not a firearm.

2612 2018-12-29 21:38:51 Lol.  You were handed a booming economy and a rising stock market by Obama.  After two years of you being in office, the economy is slowing down and stocks are tanking.  Great job!
2613 2018-12-29 21:38:41 Don't want to invest....just snipe bids on stocks,up or down, money in the bank now...not wait for stock to go up over a period of time and make a few bucks in years...I WANT THE MONEY NOW !!!!!!!!!!
2614 2018-12-29 21:37:51 Many stocks are pricing in a severe recession. Unlikely. Lots of upside going into 2019.
2615 2018-12-29 21:37:33 Had to give my wife the bad news...time to spend more time scanning again   ...but...I did learn in 2016, 17, 18...when breadth is expanding in a bull market...you make money...its really that simple...high growth stocks when the market is going up...duh!
2616 2018-12-29 21:35:46 A Bull run is what stocks had for many years after 2008! It's not a parabolic fae hype move like we had in 2017! It's a sustainable growth with healthy correction and consolidations ;)
2617 2018-12-29 21:35:20 Not if it threatens my kids or other innocents. They have a right to LIFE! I'm not trying to take your guns away - just limit assault rifles, bump stocks, etc and make them less easy to get.

2621 2018-12-29 21:32:21 Thank you again, Mr. President, for your focus on numbers and economics - the primary sustenance and motive force of life, as everything else follows from it.  The concern is that nearly the moment the Dims got elected to the House is exactly when stocks began to dwindle.
2622 2018-12-29 21:31:29 Anyone that says they’re confused and thought they brought shares ask them did they buy xrp of a cryptocurrency platform or the stock market ? Pretty sure they know the difference from stocks and cryptocurrency markets. What people need clarity on is assets and cfd margin trading
2623 2018-12-29 21:29:44 Stop being sensible Chris Call yourself a Pompey fan? Everybody knows that if we don't piss the Championship everyone at the club from Kenny Jackett to John Jenkins must be placed in stocks on Southsea Common
2624 2018-12-29 21:29:40 The US Dollar has been falling during the last two weeks.  Is this a  result of foreigners, disillusioned by trump, selling USA stocks and  bonds?   Or are foreign companies abandoning US business, thereby  reducing the need for US Dollars?  Scary stuff.
2625 2018-12-29 21:29:28 $ETH is pumping hard and will continue to do so: (1) Those in the US are selling $BTC for $ETH both to claim 2018 tax losses and to ride this $BTC reversal. Tax selling in years with losses is common in stocks, but with crypto, assets are correlated, so buying $Eth is the choice.
2626 2018-12-29 21:28:39 Was talking about experience in stocks and I know how new things work! We test, we test and we test! Right now we're still testing and this 2017 bull was just a confirmation for later but it's still new! Stocks had this time too did not avoid crashes!
2627 2018-12-29 21:27:24 Day trading? Stocks maybe?
2628 2018-12-29 21:27:21 The company rep who stocks our deli meat will also fix displays and stuff, and apparently we got a "new turkey" in that they forgot to tell any of the deli workers about. This couple decided to yell at another worker and I for suggesting the same product with a different name.
2629 2018-12-29 21:26:52 Watching an ultimate tournament is such a step up from smash 4 in many ways. More interactions with a faster pace, less overall jank with more stocks to spare, and feels like the other player has to make a big effort to outplay the other with no seemingly overcentralizing tactics
2630 2018-12-29 21:24:01 Greninjas u air jab lock is techable but he has other kill confirms that makes him really consistent at finishing stocks. One of the best characters imo but he seems really slept on in NA
2631 2018-12-29 21:23:51 Yes the entire squad needs time to bed in and get their heads around JL’s expectations
Unfortunately he doesn’t have a permanent on field leader to help him instill those disciplines
But the sad fact is the cattle just aren’t there atm in Oz cricket stocks
2632 2018-12-29 21:23:47 I didn’t say bump stocks are a class of firearm. 

Because POTUS is all about bipartisan progressivism when it comes to 2A.
2633 2018-12-29 21:23:42 Again, you make a very good point that it sets a dangerous precedence.

However, do bump stocks not allow one to simulate automatic fire?
2634 2018-12-29 21:23:16 1] A maga hat 2] a nazi symbol 3] bump stocks 4] rapid assault rifle[s]

2635 2018-12-29 21:23:04 Long term investors can take the current downturn as an opportunity to add exposure to stocks that more attractive valuations at these current price levels. Overall sentiment dragging down prices on value driven stocks
2636 2018-12-29 21:20:55 Is it ok if you call them Bump Stocks
2637 2018-12-29 21:20:32 So it's safe to short stocks?
2638 2018-12-29 21:20:17 You mean the last 30 years when democratic leadership was in place where stocks, profits and jobs went up? Or the disaatrous periods when @gop were in charge?
2639 2018-12-29 21:18:59 on a serious note, I think olimar in the current meta isnt S tier.  most S tier's have an incredible punish game, taking stocks early and easily. With parrying and a much faster neutral, I think olimar will decline into high mid tier.
2640 2018-12-29 21:18:20 I hope Capcom can find it in their hearts to allow Juri to start each round with all 3 stocks. Ibuki starts each round strapped with hella kunais but Juri can't start the round with a -2 ob fireball?

lol cmonnah!
2641 2018-12-29 21:18:02 I didnt go to trump university, maybe I would have leaned to trade crypto stocks there.
2642 2018-12-29 21:17:22 Well that's one way to get it done Donnie... Instead of brutalizing Federal workers... Your stocks raising... yeah...
2643 2018-12-29 21:16:29 Anyone i know here an trader ?? 

Stocks not currency
2644 2018-12-29 21:16:05 I mean, you know how 200 years ago they put people in stocks and let townspeople throw things at them and mock them for days?  I want that very badly.
2645 2018-12-29 21:15:51 You watch,this is just a1st step! China has nearly depleted her own coastal waters for fish&will move more&more into Japan, Phil&Viet waters to suck up their stocks.Some believe war could start in the SCS w/US vessels,but it could easily begin over such a vital issue! @GregPoling
2646 2018-12-29 21:15:05 that is only half the story...the other half is the loss in 401ks...i do believe that everything breaks right and stocks at end of 2019 are at sp 3100 but we have to get things done positively
2647 2018-12-29 21:14:48 Unless those workers had stocks in their 401K amirite?
2648 2018-12-29 21:13:50 This is an abuse of powers. There is no national emergency and I cannot imagine him making the argument that we’re having an economic crisis when he continually brags about the economy!!  Stocks are generally up, unemployment is low...where’s the economic problem?
2649 2018-12-29 21:13:22 Are bump stocks permitted?
2650 2018-12-29 21:12:08 Hahah the poor people from Carrier and HD?? You grasped Obama’s coattails and claimed his numbers as yours. 2 years in, stocks tank and intrest rates rise for borrowers. The only wall you will see is from the prison yard
2651 2018-12-29 21:10:07 Lee....did you notice that the only corporate stocks rising are those of #JailContractors..??
They charge the govt. $250/day per Inmate..! A Billionnaire Business #UsingHumanBeings as a commodity..?!
Is our society so decadently money-driven rotten already.?
2652 2018-12-29 21:09:58 3/

If an investor had invested only the £200,000 in these two stocks over this time period it would be now worth £152,354.  They have therefore made around a 23% loss on their investments.
2653 2018-12-29 21:09:56 2019 The Year of The Broke Ass Worker. When people get screwed from the Tax Scam. When they can't afford groceries. When they can't retire as stocks drop even lower. Happy New Year.
2654 2018-12-29 21:09:55 los que ponen 3 min 3 stock en quick play. los odio y arruinan mi juego.

me han hecho mas agresivo y lanzado sin planear las cosas bien que requiero quitarles 2 stocks en 1 min mie tras ellos huyen como marikas para llevarme a sudden death.

Putos los forglorianos de este juego.
2655 2018-12-29 21:09:12 With such a few moments when the stocks were by Marianne's countenance betrayed her husband's from the lock, when you have
2656 2018-12-29 21:09:04 Actually pretty mediocre wage gains when you factor in inflation, plus retirement savings held in stocks are down and several large employers announced massive layoffs. So much winning!
2657 2018-12-29 21:08:40 That might be true, just hope they didn’t put their 401k in stocks, otherwise it would be worth less now than when you cam into office. Is that a good thing?
2658 2018-12-29 21:07:28 He's only rich because he owns stocks. His salary is like 80k salary. The employees get stocks too so they get richer as the prices go up but yeah they run those fulfillment centers at a loss to beat out competition and fund them from other Amazon things.
2659 2018-12-29 21:05:47 Now that Trump's trade wars/tariffs are tanking stocks, will the @GOP stop giving him a pass & suddenly grow a conscience? 

Trump screwing up the Obama recovery he was handed could be the key to the GOP joining the Dems in impeaching Trump.

or will they go down with the ship?
2660 2018-12-29 21:05:14 Also why wouldn’t I support Trump? Record low unemployment for blacks and hispanics, stocks breaking records, no new wars...sorry you don’t like that kind of stuff. Figured you for a racist war monger
2661 2018-12-29 21:05:12 Then how does the POTUS have authority to ban bump-stocks as they are now classified as automatic device?
2662 2018-12-29 21:05:09 Oh shoot, I have mince pies in the pantry, thanks Cara! Re wine, it`s "until stocks last" 
2663 2018-12-29 21:04:40 And to make the investment in stocks worth it you need a return of 8-10%
2664 2018-12-29 21:04:01 Career criminals will always find a way to get a firearm, more regulation won't stop them. Did you know theFeds recently placed restrictions on bump-stocks..?
2665 2018-12-29 21:03:41 Career criminals will always find a way to get a firearm, more regulation won't stop them. Did you know theFeds recently placed restrictions on bump-stocks..?
2666 2018-12-29 21:03:27 I agree with your whole chain here - p/f returns can be meaningless because of those factors. Although when Rhomboid tells us his returns on his 8 stocks, I cannot fail but to be impressed 
2667 2018-12-29 21:01:58 What's the story of the Mike Bigger guy peddling penny stocks on StockTwits? His post "so cheap and growing fast" seriously? You allow that crap?
2668 2018-12-29 21:01:30 But the farmers still support this Russian puppet.  Lmao sell your stocks, move to bonds and REIT.  Get ready. When it bottoms out, buy back in
2669 2018-12-29 21:01:24 @vladstocks what's up vlad thank for starting vlad stocks, you've helped me a lot.
2670 2018-12-29 21:00:55 How are you getting around the pattern day trading with $3500 in the account.  Just curious what platform you’ll be using.  I’m in on this.  Options or stocks?
2671 2018-12-29 21:00:32 The NRA supported the ban on bump stocks
2672 2018-12-29 21:00:16 This lie will go far with your Dementia Riddled and Trailer Park Base but what will you tell your friends about their stocks Spanky?
2673 2018-12-29 20:59:55 Companies trying to send shareholders reports knowing stocks are doing terrible and right before 2019. Please, don't kill my vibe.
2674 2018-12-29 20:59:39 who  is doing better than they were in 08?
we lost our homes, our jobs, our pensions, our healthcare, and some of us lost friends and family to more war, but the Dow did great? 
85% of stocks are owned by 1% of the population, most of us are still in a depression 10 years later
2675 2018-12-29 20:59:28 I don't think Target stocks Neca stuff. I think they just basically supply space and Neca's guys stock it all. Hence that dumb ambassador program. If only Randy answered questions other than the same 5 he always does...
2676 2018-12-29 20:59:16 Stocks and crypto. And real estate as dividends
2677 2018-12-29 20:57:08 Gold stocks. 
2678 2018-12-29 20:57:03 I'm not a Democrat but there are gun grabbers in the Republican party as well. Trump banned bump stocks, Ronald Reagan banned new machineguns.

2680 2018-12-29 20:55:29 It's all your fault. No amount of tweets are going to change the fact that you made this mess, along with the shutdown mess and the stocks going down
2681 2018-12-29 20:55:16 Anything is possible, and probably big names want to hedge some small percent in stocks to crypto.
2682 2018-12-29 20:54:30 POST-CHRISTMAS SALE!

2684 2018-12-29 20:53:51 Genuine question: why do you feel that civilians need bump stocks or military grade assault rifles? (Not tryna start shit, genuinely curious, I personally prefer rifles to handguns but I'm not about to role play American Sniper and buy an AK and bump stock)
2685 2018-12-29 20:52:13 Spent part of the day researching Nvidia $NVDA,  because of the selloff. Looks like it might be at a good price around $135, but... the MASSIVE insider selling gives me pause. Might wait. It continues even after the selloff. #investing #Stocks
2686 2018-12-29 20:52:02 How? Easy, cycles! Crypto is new, stocks are not and crypto is far from the stocks for now! When liquidity and the real one we'll have a new bull run! We'll have some rallies but not a bull run! Next one will be bigger and longer! Data and experience ;)
2687 2018-12-29 20:51:35 Interested to know how this is regulated. Are there fines? A warning? Public shaming in the stocks?
2688 2018-12-29 20:51:31 2 Stocks, Battlefield form only, 5 mins, any character SQUARE UP
2689 2018-12-29 20:49:33 A jail is far to comfortable bring back the stocks.
2690 2018-12-29 20:47:59 Hey farmer friends, I am looking for examples of NZ food producers exporting their products directly.  Anyone got some examples for me?  I found a bunch of manufacturers selling their wares on Alibaba (eg pies, stocks, jerky)...but no farmers.  Help me out?
2691 2018-12-29 20:46:32 Just got some free siri stocks 
2692 2018-12-29 20:43:35 Maybe try a different ruleset? Or more stocks? Or a higher AI setting? thats so weird because I got all of them via AI Smash except like, Dr. Mario and Sheik through world of light
2693 2018-12-29 20:43:33 As we close this year, will you think the Big Board in New York will be in the positive or the negative? Or do you this the #stocks will break even on Monday?
2694 2018-12-29 20:43:00 Almost nothing, but they got the bump stock ban through, right? I haven't been directly affected by bump stocks, but I think it is good to ban them. Just looking on the bright side. The rest sucks.
2695 2018-12-29 20:42:49 Stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down! Beware of sell offs!
2696 2018-12-29 20:42:34 This is just early indicator of the trend. German stocks should continue its decline in 2019 to a more reasonable valuations by end of next year.
2697 2018-12-29 20:42:17 antiquated terms...worked when mkt moved 10% a year every year, now mkts and stocks move 10% every few hours/days, terms are outdated and useless and anyone who keys on them, is out of touch with current markets
2698 2018-12-29 20:40:29 can u alert me on common stocks > RSI cross over( for example > from 20's to 70's on a day alert
2699 2018-12-29 20:40:09 Sure enough to know that I do not ever want anything whatsoever to do with stocks in my life ever again.  Forever.
2700 2018-12-29 20:39:13 Oh my up go the Trump Family stocks...
2701 2018-12-29 20:38:05 Sooo “Fitbit” Stocks Are Only 5 Bucks a Share, I Think Imma Grab Like 200 Dollars Worth Of Them & Just Sit On Them & See What Happens 
2702 2018-12-29 20:37:43 Wish I had extra money to hop on the stocks, they going back up now though
2703 2018-12-29 20:37:39 More consensus that if you’re worried about your stocks going down, you should either sell them, or buy some puts on them... that CTA strategy or USDJPY calls or VIX ratios might well not work when you want it to
2704 2018-12-29 20:36:17 Or #YU, which is ONLY down 92%
2705 2018-12-29 20:34:52 Once Wall Street stops to sponsor Chinese companies, you will see China collapses in a flash, for sure. Chinese people don’t buy the stocks of their own countries, only the gamblers. 90% of listed companies in China don’t make money at all and Chinese knew.
2706 2018-12-29 20:34:43 This Trump / Xi phone-call better have some follow through. It’d be such a huge win..forget stocks, just in general it’d be such a game changer for world business.
2707 2018-12-29 20:34:20 Yeah, in the short term, the rule should be incompatibility (with the solution to sell). One can always choose to keep the stocks and not run for public office.
2708 2018-12-29 20:33:18 In which case my point no longer stands.

I play items and hazards on with stock matches all the time and I enjoy it. But we usually have 5 or more stocks each and play on a big stage like Temple.

Idk if that enables any more "skill" but the people I play w/ have no skill anyway
2709 2018-12-29 20:33:16 I'm so much looking forward to the coming House investigations. Buying popcorn stocks might be a good idea. Republicans have been out to lunch these last two years! They think they took a routing during midterms. Wait til 2020. Don't like one party rule. Thanks Republicans!
2710 2018-12-29 20:32:50 Time accelerates in the evening faster than algorithms shorting stocks at the end of day
2711 2018-12-29 20:31:40 From the shape and attachment style, those look like detached AK-47 rifle stocks. Hard to tell from the fuzzy images, but I'd bet that they attach to some kind of assault rifle, if not the AK. Hope that helps.
2712 2018-12-29 20:31:17 Does that mean the people you have caught will get more than a slap on the wrist?  I think we should get stocks back in the high street to increase footfall in our town centres 
2713 2018-12-29 20:31:10 Good points.  I was at one conference where the speaker said most people have no idea what there return is.  This is because of putting money in and out over time.  To work it out you need to do it in excel which is a bit laborious.  Also what if you have funds as well as stocks?
2714 2018-12-29 20:28:45 The best Norwegian stocks #salmon stocks +50% 2018
2715 2018-12-29 20:28:34 Strange that stocks are not going higher with that such an extreme change in Put/Call-ratio in one week. Think I just might contribute to at least level that ratio very soon...
2716 2018-12-29 20:27:53 Diversification is a must. Not only across stocks but also across all asset classes. Fair value is subjective, and also convergence is not guaranteed.
2717 2018-12-29 20:26:11 Bump stocks are brilliant and I love the idea and civilians should not have them.
2718 2018-12-29 20:23:32 Have to agree with you slightly from a Chelsea perspective his stocks have dropped quite a bit still a talent but big clubs can’t wait for talents

2720 2018-12-29 20:22:35 You may want to do some introductory reading about the carbon cycle, including the vital distinction between stocks and flows. Building up biomass in forests can create a one-off reduction in atmospheric CO2, but it doesn't compensate for burning fossil fuels year after year
2721 2018-12-29 20:21:52 At dinner w/ 5 women in their 20s, one mentions she was encouraged to buy stocks in high school. All of the women said "I wish I had done that!" 

But none are investing now. Young people, you have the luxury to look back when you're 40+ & say "I'm so glad I did that in my 20s!"
2722 2018-12-29 20:21:34 Sorry klab,  but no,  this is the reason why your stocks is so bad, remove the step up and fix the summons, I know that you guys want to make the game better,  so fix what is broken many people quit the game because they did not get the character they wanted
2723 2018-12-29 20:20:57 Trust you will charge him for the luxury B&B, then make sure he loses his licence. Then, a couple of days in the 'stocks', that would reinforce the message and we would all be happy to pay a modest sum to throw rotten vegetables.

2726 2018-12-29 20:15:09 Diversify outside of crypto to lessen exposure to a single. American weed stocks to protect your value from a decline in gbp or bottom fish the ftse 100 when Brexit sends prices back to 2008
2727 2018-12-29 20:14:58 It’s just sort of irrelevant, equivalent to saying “equities have a positive expected return over time”... doesn’t mean the puts are mispriced, any more than it means that stocks are mispriced because they have positive expected returns. You’re supposed to be compensated for risk
2728 2018-12-29 20:13:48 @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Please America just give a little time to fulfill ALL of my promises to you. We are now getting rid of fire-arm Bump Stocks .. what Democrate could have done that!? And, eventually Mexico will pay for our wall.

2733 2018-12-29 20:12:11 I do the same but I tighten the criteria to narrow down to 5-12 stocks. Then back test when available to gauge probabilities of a search.

2736 2018-12-29 20:10:19 Possibly. Certainly is a nanny state. If you chart house price growth you’ll see incredible growth which has been driven by loose regulations. Perhaps I just answered the question - capital has gone into the property market and not stocks.

2740 2018-12-29 20:05:51 Out of interest how can you be so certain about 2022, or are you just trying to keep hype to a minimum? I mean this is crypto, I understand experience is important but still stocks are so different, no?

2743 2018-12-29 20:04:18 Perceived safe havens like utilities and consumer staples, often an afterthought in Wall Street's cascade of year-ahead investment recommendations each December, are emerging as top picks as stocks limp into 2019.
2744 2018-12-29 20:03:27 Ok for the first 100 people who email me at GregoryMannarino@hotmail.com and tell me what nice/positive thing you did today for someone else, I will send you 100% FREE, a PDF of "Get Paid Upfront to Trade Stocks." Please NO other email, questions on stocks etc. Much love, Greg.
2745 2018-12-29 20:03:02 I sold at $16 dollars!! This takeover bid is well below the value of Apha!! All of these stocks are down at the moment! This stock is worth every bit of $16!!
2746 2018-12-29 20:03:02 Don’t you get it.  No deal until 2020.  This belongs to Trump and we the people do not want a wall. We want immigrantion reform,affordable healthcare for all, safe roads and water,
Tax break for middle class not the rich, restored respect in the world, strong and growing stocks

2752 2018-12-29 20:01:54 @RobinhoodApp my account was deleted and when it came back up all my money and stocks are missing. What happened to my money and stocks? Why doesn’t it show up anymore?
2753 2018-12-29 20:01:00 yea. have lost stocks to air dodges many times
2754 2018-12-29 20:00:42 What stocks or investments do you recommend for 2019?
2755 2018-12-29 20:00:42 And the average saver, who gets near 0% #interest, gets told to buy #stocks! ; )

2756 2018-12-29 19:59:35 But now a lot of Stocks are -50% down. They cant fall under Zero.
2757 2018-12-29 19:58:44 I thought I read thatbthe NRA didn’t oppose banning bump stocks.  It was an issue they supported so Trump could look like he was doing something about gun control without defying the NRA
2758 2018-12-29 19:57:32 I use Acorns to save money passively! It rounds up all of your card purchases to the next dollar and invests the money into stocks/bonds. And you set a recurring investment which helps save as well. I put over $900 into it this year!
2759 2018-12-29 19:56:48 Wow you are so educated, how about some credibility and reveal these amazing stocks that buck the trend.
Stop bragging and prove it.
2760 2018-12-29 19:56:33 The problem is not making money on day trade volatile stocks...it's pumping those stocks to their followers...but again...if they don't do their own DD I guess they got what's coming to them...
2761 2018-12-29 19:56:10 Bother are beyond dumb; but  has it for the pure lunacy. The Stocks could happen, but it all happens in that jellybeans head.

2763 2018-12-29 19:55:14 I mean I’m not sure it extracts wealth from poor people, the poor are not buying many stocks. They money is coming from other rich people buying stocks

2766 2018-12-29 19:54:31 I can't believe these fabulous products are 30-50% off!!! Only whilst stocks last though - they're selling out super quick!!!

2768 2018-12-29 19:51:21 how can stocks trade below share the price you bid and you dont get allocated? @QTRResearch @Keubiko @GeoInvesting i literally watched shares trade below my bid price, like someone was happily selling shares below what i was offering for it.
2769 2018-12-29 19:50:27 Still in love with the stylish minimalist icons Ultimate uses for stocks rather than the older style.
2770 2018-12-29 19:50:10 OH WAIT i just checked my stocks and i have 2 more left of kakyoin~~ (some fell inside my bag) but no more jotaro;;;
2771 2018-12-29 19:48:06 Your comment almost seems insightful but it’s not.  Most gun owners are law abiding citizens.  It doesn’t matter if law abiding people have bump stocks because they aren’t going to commit crimes.  The bad guys will continue to disregard the law.  The law accomplished nothing.

2780 2018-12-29 19:43:28 I have bought a shed load of stocks this week for my own portfolio, not just clients. I think you’ll find we get paid for cash held too, so our only incentive is to see our client’s pot grow, not diminish. Goals aligned.

2784 2018-12-29 19:37:40 Happy birthday Latha. Do tell me new year multibagger reco stocks, if you know any.And thank you for your balanced questioning.
2785 2018-12-29 19:36:17 Sounds like it. But surely you can buy canadian stocks? Cheaper for you in CA$
2786 2018-12-29 19:35:21 Paying taxes keeps the rich who own businesses and stocks stay rich.
2787 2018-12-29 19:33:04 Please don't be so defensive, I might come about as an arrogant twat but I'm genuinely interested in what you think and I think your views have a lot of value -not about mistakes, we all make them. My question is if stocks continue going lower, will it make you change your view?
2788 2018-12-29 19:30:13 I love how Sheik plays in this game but man he deals no damage at all. It takes way to much work to deal stocks
2789 2018-12-29 19:29:27 Yes I am arguing US stocks have much higher to go before it’s all said and done.  Thought we would get 10% correction.  We got 20% instead. I was wrong about the size.  Any other mistakes you me to admit I made?  I’m sure there are plenty.
2790 2018-12-29 19:28:21 "Oh weird must be my internet acting up again" he says as he 3 stocks you

2792 2018-12-29 19:26:42 Focusing on getting my stocks up!
2793 2018-12-29 19:26:34 Which stocks would you suggest to buy?
2794 2018-12-29 19:26:07 One shot Tax Revenues on Dividend Income is predictable; but sill lowest in 3 years. We Do have a revenue problem, we have working Americans on public assistance because of unlivable minimum wage, which serves only The Wealthy, the 1% , and the 10% who hold majority of stocks
2795 2018-12-29 19:26:01 I’m a Rave boy at heart .. I just trade stocks to pay the bills .
2796 2018-12-29 19:26:01 so do you think about stocks? i feel you with not being able to see your 401K though
2797 2018-12-29 19:25:52 Wait until January for ur new yr present   get out of stocks now b4 u got time!
2798 2018-12-29 19:24:08 just like the stocks
2799 2018-12-29 19:23:33 Nothing like researching stocks on a Saturday night.
2800 2018-12-29 19:23:15 I’m so sick of South America... let it go. I’m so sick of China... let them have their strong economy. 85% of stocks are owned by the VERY wealthy.... they don’t by stuff that generate corporate profits... Main Street buys everything.... and ur scaring us with your preoccupations
2801 2018-12-29 19:22:13 The so called paper is infact supporting the statement that, buffet is indeed long term holder. The 30% churn is based on 'number of stocks". In terms of portfolio value, the churn is only 5%(that too including Berkshire's arbitrage operations)
2802 2018-12-29 19:21:59 I’m so mad I don’t have the extra money rn to be investing in stocks cuz the markets been nice in the past few weeks 
2803 2018-12-29 19:20:06 We own 60—75 stocks,we have small holdings in a number of securities.1 reason for this is that while selling a stock,it goes down and we end up holdings some of its shares.Sometimes when buying a stock it goes up,we don’t want to follow it up so we stop buying it..Walter Schols
2804 2018-12-29 19:19:24 The Stock Market is PHONEY. Best stocks are PENNY STOCKS or just go to the CASINO
2805 2018-12-29 19:18:56 She doesn't own oil or coal stocks. Its a mutual fund that invests in electric and natural gas utilities. The largest company in the fund is Southern Company that is committed to low emission and has reduced its use of coal from 63% to 28% as of 2017 with plans to eliminate.
2806 2018-12-29 19:18:29 But isn’t Trump a tyrant for banning your bump stocks?  Or do your principles only matter when they can be wielded as a political wedge in favor of Republicans?
2807 2018-12-29 19:18:02 Ooooo, we’ve limited stocks until Easter’ish but can tot up the remaining 2017 batch to see if we’ve enough if you want a box!
2808 2018-12-29 19:17:24 Stocks were at discount last week.  It was a good time to buy.

Stocks are a long term strategy....so weekly ups & downs don't matter...just windows of when you can get some discounts.
2809 2018-12-29 19:17:04 What about CPP? THEY OWN THE STOCKS DO THEY COME FIRST?
2810 2018-12-29 19:16:56 I don't think we are in any position to give anyone stick this season.

2812 2018-12-29 19:16:28 It would appear in the mid to long term you lose money on stocks.

2815 2018-12-29 19:13:47 Tell me, does the fee for your lesson in bloodthirstiness include "the artful use of bump stocks"?
2816 2018-12-29 19:13:39 It's been stuck in neutral for 4 years, c'mon. Also, where's the rush into US assets? I thought you were arguing for US stocks to go up? Both stocks & USTs are down in 2018.
2817 2018-12-29 19:13:07 The #POTUS needs the house & senate to get resolution on any issue. #immigration was & has been an issue long before #Trump took office.

2824 2018-12-29 19:07:25 Vic has always been the front line man at Aphria. The investors looked up to him, believed in him, and now it seems like he is hiding out and not following through... i will put my money into real MJ STOCKS. $CRON $MMEN
2825 2018-12-29 19:07:07 This is a chart for all the 401k retirement hopefuls who think stocks earn 8% a year reliably. US stocks have been the exception and it will come to an end.
2826 2018-12-29 19:07:01 Upgrade my studio setup. Besides that prolly more stocks
2827 2018-12-29 19:06:51 Even medical companies makes budgets for the upcoming year and the financial pressure from stock holders to reach budget targets is always present. EU companies have already redirected stocks to other countries to be guaranteed to sell without disruption, could be a case of that.
2828 2018-12-29 19:06:45 That would be a decent plan.
I do plan on expanding into other areas of investment soon enough, maybe this year (stocks, forex, real-estate).
But everything takes time. For now I'm focused on perfecting/improving my trading, growing my current assets.

2831 2018-12-29 19:01:43 Statement that would have been useful for investors considering crypto: BTC is much more volatile than stocks, and you should factor in that even in some of the largest meltdowns of S&P 500, BTC has been more volatile just in 2018 alone. Aggregate $ losses don’t matter, %’s do
2832 2018-12-29 19:01:09 So we should get millionaire with crypto and then go on the stocks market to become billionaire?

2834 2018-12-29 18:59:56 Go back a few years and I was a lot more bitter and focussed on other people’s stocks. Basically my energy was in the wrong area. As soon as I started focusing on my own goals and strategy it was a big turning point.
2835 2018-12-29 18:59:40 TMF, which used to rail against pink sheet junk stocks, now hyping them. They’ve let the socialist degenerates take over that site. It’s garbage now.
2836 2018-12-29 18:58:59 How can banks possibly do so bad when stocks have never been higher?
2837 2018-12-29 18:58:48 Sure, the statement is highly misleading and infers that stocks are more volatile than crypto. I would fear that ppl read @APompliano and decide their $ is safer in crypto. It’s not, or at least it’s not today (I’m excited long term about decentralized networks). It’s relative.
2838 2018-12-29 18:58:42 To the assholes who keep killing me in a 3-man free-for-all in Smash when there's a guy with 2 stocks left: I HOPE YOU LOSE FOREVER.
2839 2018-12-29 18:58:31 On my way out today I saw Denisa holding a menu of food and they said to me when i get lonely i buy stocks, just to have some company
2840 2018-12-29 18:56:01 Mtg stocks maybe? I've moved away from MTG price since they haven't been on top of newest set releases.
2841 2018-12-29 18:54:38 Trading. 

I also have an account with @GT_247 where I can short stocks and other tradable securities such as indices and commodities. GT247 also offer leverage, but that's a double edged sword, use it with care.
2842 2018-12-29 18:53:32 I mean yea. We’re still ahead for the year in stocks while in the middle of a trade war with China. Everyone else has caved and we’ve gotten better deals. China will cave soon. Their economy is tanking. Better for the American people after this trade war ends.
2843 2018-12-29 18:53:27 Nothing wrong with this candidate or her mutual fund investments. Strong environmental record. The fund is a mutual fund so she does not hold stocks. The mutual fund holds public, regulated electricity and smaller natural gas utilities. Story sounds like investments in Exxon. not
2844 2018-12-29 18:51:14 Learning to trade stocks is so purty.
2845 2018-12-29 18:50:51 Investors hinting- largest Liberal State CA buy into all munchies stocks for legal drug smokers. & invest in manufacturing on site testers for drug smokers for drivers under influence of marijuana’s negative effects for police stops. Profits in importing these too. Thinking 
2846 2018-12-29 18:49:41 You’re right. Regardless of what Trump does during a shutdown he caused, he will get called out because he did exactly that. Also, he didn’t support any bill to ban bump stocks while it was in Congress, so cut the crap.
2847 2018-12-29 18:48:21 walking down stairs to see my dad air pods calling about stocks and dividends. what timeline are we in
2848 2018-12-29 18:48:04 You're finally getting it. 
And representation, stocks, job security, safety protections, accommodations for pregnant and injured workers, pay for inspection time. 

Something you, an IBEW member, should understand.
2849 2018-12-29 18:47:37 I don’t think we should talk about this. At least my food stocks are canned and they are not as old as WW2 K rations.
2850 2018-12-29 18:46:35 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
2851 2018-12-29 18:46:23 It certainly may, and if we get more stories floated out regarding some kind of deal (true or not) that will boost stocks in the short run as well. But without a real trade deal, stocks will fall.

2860 2018-12-29 18:35:44 Well after leading stocks like $AAPL, no doubt a staple of such portfolios, had already split wide open...
2861 2018-12-29 18:35:34 Ben quoi,c'est la fin de l'année...il faut liquider les stocks...
2862 2018-12-29 18:35:29 A fund simply buys and sells company stocks.  So instead of being all in with one company, you are invested in hundreds.  Companies have responsibility to stockholders but that doesn't mean their shares don't fluctuate, sometimes wildly.  As well, shitty fund managers get fired.
2863 2018-12-29 18:35:12 Jobs are down, stocks are down, deficit is up, Hillary isn’t in jail but many of trumps cabinet and friends are, Mexico isn’t paying for the wall, he lost North Korea and Iran, now he’s surrendering to isis...if this is him winning I’d hate to see what losing looks like 
2864 2018-12-29 18:31:50 i found high income stocks to be bad investments.
2865 2018-12-29 18:31:33 My premarital assets consisted (mostly) of a closely-held company (my business), stocks and a vintage motorcycle, Laughingly, I also claimed a set of steak knives. Although ownership of these assets were challenged by my ex, the facts legally ruled them out as "untouchable".

2871 2018-12-29 18:25:45 More about a collective market breadth with the S&P.

Usually if you're going into a bearish trend, money as a collective whole comes out of the individual stocks bringing them all down together. Only a minor few will bounce with relative strength compared to the index.
2872 2018-12-29 18:25:29 Trump banned bump stocks.
2873 2018-12-29 18:25:10 Lol, it's 8 weeks, so not even 2 full months. He is taking credit for the 2018 economy & stocks despite not being in office, as he has been doing constantly. The market always ebbs and flows. He'll be back in the coming weeks and months, especially when 2020 campaigning starts.
2874 2018-12-29 18:24:40 If you need income there were several volume blowouts in income stocks out there. I bought some MLP stuff, more income never hurt #yield
2875 2018-12-29 18:23:56 Stocks aren't low enough yet .... he's holding his famous Chapter 11 card .... running the US like his failed businesses @realDonaldTrump
2876 2018-12-29 18:23:07 Thanks man... Problem is, I'm all cash now. I will never buy when the market is way up on BS news like this for it to fall off a cliff after open

With cash, I can wait... I'll either buy the VIX cheap, or wait for that market fall to buy stocks cheap

2881 2018-12-29 18:19:44 Robinhood is a great way to start learning about stocks and investing. Just have an honest conversation with him about trading vs investing.
2882 2018-12-29 18:19:40 I am afraid of individual stocks "bookkeeping" in China.
2883 2018-12-29 18:19:15 No lie. I'm trying to find a virtual reality company to buy stocks in now.
2884 2018-12-29 18:18:50 It's a cult. They believe anything he says. Yesterday I was reading some mentions on the bump stock ban Trump signed. The MAGA's kept saying "fake news". They actually believe Trump didn't ban bump stocks and it's made up.

2891 2018-12-29 18:15:25 Monday is the last day of Q4 so it's best to get as much $TSLA and other quality stocks on your Q4 filings as possible.

2897 2018-12-29 18:09:24 I see all these ads for wealth funds and stocks for a "comfortable retirement" but no one talks about the financial cost of elder Care and how that exacerbates the stress of care giving.
2898 2018-12-29 18:09:20 If there’s no deal and you raise tariffs to 25%, #stocks will crater.  Then you can kiss any chance of a second term goodbye.

2900 2018-12-29 18:07:59 That’s not at all the same thing. And comparing a personal property that kills cash flow to an investment (stocks or real estate) is apples and oranges. Paying off a personal property lowers your debt to income allowing you to invest more & frees up cash flow
2901 2018-12-29 18:07:55 Despite great games like God of War 4, Spider Man, Red Dead Redemption 2, Smash Ultimate and others being highly successful, the stocks actually been nearly to its overhaul for this year. This isn't just an EA issue, but the industry issue as a whole.

2908 2018-12-29 18:03:18 Intervention will not save US marks anymore. Global markets began selling off w/o since late 17 & early 18. US is just beginning. We are more likely to re-visit 08 levels. CB tricks saved stocks since 09 but how will that work now? It didn't work before the than on stocks.
2909 2018-12-29 18:03:18 I can be aware that nothing is 100% and constantly re-value the decisions but all the big investors usually starts with 1-4 stocks and not the common approach of 10-16 stock - so this is fantastic general advice but does not reflect reality of real real investors - 1 of 10000
2910 2018-12-29 18:02:41 You have to keep in mind the inflation over the years. Stocks always go up in the long run precisely because of inflation.
I am very interested to see the same chart adjusted for inflation.
2911 2018-12-29 18:02:02 All good comments that you say but will the stocks keep going down? This matters a lot for us citizens since WE do NOT have money like you do. Be compassionate for Americans, please.

2939 2018-12-29 17:41:31 Thanks for posting. Interesting read.... maybe balance it and do some of both. Just don't do what I did these past years and be overly invested (almost completely) in tech stocks. I need to learn to be more balanced.
2940 2018-12-29 17:41:03 Lots of leading indicators besides stocks that econ will be trending down, eg GM, Harley Davidson, etc plants closing, others slowing due to tarrifs on eg steel, but not on finished goods they compete w, raising costs while making foreign compettitors more attractive to consumers

2945 2018-12-29 17:33:23 This is exactly the type of article that should make everyone go out and buy stocks. 

The market climbs a wall of worry and as long as morons like this are worried, the better stocks are for us that believe in the strength of the American economy.
2946 2018-12-29 17:33:03 Maybe they DID outlaw Bump Stocks! But when did the redneck KKK racist #IQ45 people ever give a damn abt what's legal or illegal? oh wait. I 4got.

Markets are vulnerable to fears that a downturn is near, even as we see the actual risk of a U.S. recession low in 2019. Global earnings growth is also set to moderate in 2019, tracking the more subdued growth outlook.

2952 2018-12-29 17:26:51 It’s simpler:

“For almost a decade after it bottomed out in March 2009, the stock market seemed as if it would only go up.”

Fed just said this is the best economy in a decade. And stocks have been rising for a decade till now. 

Wall St and Main St often move in oppo directions
2953 2018-12-29 17:26:27 No. It’s a union talking point. Cuz I’m actually Union. 
You don’t give up pay first. You go pie in the sky on wages, and use those to accumulate goals on safety, accommodations, representation, severance, seniority, security, stocks, pension 

Then you negotiate from there.
2954 2018-12-29 17:26:27 Having seen such a big fall in 2018 in so much loved stocks - many are super bearish and those who are bullish are very fearful! Very interesting times ahead - now greed needs to set in - what would do that? 12K+++ on nifty!

2956 2018-12-29 17:24:58 Oh, I was confused. I assumed Dean was referring to privatization efforts, based on the way he's talked about "the 90's" in the context of social security debates in the past. My pension plan hornbook is at home, but weren't pension funds able to invest in stocks since ERISA?
2957 2018-12-29 17:24:56 From my perspective, the market is only healthy when leading growth stocks and growth sectors are being accumulated. When that stops so does the market.

2991 2018-12-29 17:06:32 On a les stocks pour au moins 20 ans et l’EPR pourra tourner avec 100% de déchets retraités.
2992 2018-12-29 17:06:28 We want our bum stocks back, traitor
2993 2018-12-29 17:06:08 If a real deal is made, and we have heard MORE than several fake stories like this, stocks will rise. As for a melt up, something else would also need to happen IMO.
2994 2018-12-29 17:04:51 ‘Condors’ Strategist Pravit Chintawongvanich - Large options writers used a strategy called “condors,” involves selling puts or the right to unload stocks at a specific price. As the market kept falling, these traders were forced to buy back the options while selling fresh ones.
2995 2018-12-29 17:03:32 Ton of stocks suddenly have "golden cross" potential, quite dangerous in this bearish trend. $SPY $QQQ $IWM $AAPL $NVDA $BA $QCOM $BAC $M $INTC

3004 2018-12-29 16:57:15 “If this is all we're going to get, it is a whopping disappointment and we are adding at least 200 million bushels to our soybean stocks,"

Yes, do keep up... with what’s ACTUALLY reported.
3005 2018-12-29 16:56:45 Agreed: "Second, the strongest performing stocks during a correction often emerge as new leaders when the correction ends."
3006 2018-12-29 16:55:23 Umm. Bump stocks aren't weapons. Good try though.
3007 2018-12-29 16:54:00 Haha! The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted in 1977. The crash occurred bc Clinton signed away Glass/Steagall which allowed Wall Street to trade mtgs. like penny stocks. Also changed the rules for Fannie + Freddie to remove risk to lenders. Nice try though.
3008 2018-12-29 16:53:46 I think they should bring back the stocks for certain crimes. In the age of social media, what better deterrent?
3009 2018-12-29 16:52:45 For the last year I have been slowly moving my meager retirement nestegg from stocks and bonds to Cash.
People who trusted reality TV con man Trump ( 4 or 5 times bankrupt ? ) to handle the USA economy with the "Best" people are, for the most part, economic stupids.

3010 2018-12-29 16:52:26 What? You do this about every other week. But nothing no comes of it. You say great progress and the Chinese are never as excited. Meantime you remind the market of the issues and stocks collapse. It is much better for all if you just keep quite.

3013 2018-12-29 16:49:50 If trade war ends in 2019, when, trade will jump up and stocks follow the suit, unless crisis 2019 in Europe, M-E, S-A, Asia run out of control because of fails, creed in funding, monetary policies, wars break out.
3014 2018-12-29 16:49:19 Bought Apple in 1985 and after all the splits and stock dividends, it’s been a great stock to own.  I’m a corporate legal secretary dealing with mergers and acquisitions.  The corporate attys bought and sold stocks and I watched and listened.
3015 2018-12-29 16:48:23 I played vs a K tool that had it set to 3 mins 3 stocks and just ran the entire game after he took the first stock. And k tool doesn't die. Dude was straight up scum
3016 2018-12-29 16:48:16 Did you invest in any stocks in 2018?
3017 2018-12-29 16:47:57 My pull out game has been weak. Fucking stocks have taken a plummet and I’m here letting my money sit in these shares. $2k gone in just days......
3018 2018-12-29 16:47:19 Totally agree, put the 8 in stocks in the town centre and allow people to take revenge for AJ and brother.  Let's hope they get their own medicine soon!
3019 2018-12-29 16:46:08 But what if I invest the dividends in NON-dividend stocks? Or even better an index? This makes me diversified, right?!

3023 2018-12-29 16:44:56 No I’m not and yes I am.  When growth stocks are being accumulated they are very good to own. When they are not, they are very bad to own. Growth is higher beta (risk) so their price action gives me a window into the overall mindset of the market.  That’s how I see it anyway.

3025 2018-12-29 16:44:39 In case you missed it:  “Investors can bid farewell to the worst year for stocks in a decade, but they may not find a way to escape the volatility when the new year starts with a bang.” I bought Apple in the 1985 soon after it went public.
3026 2018-12-29 16:43:40 How much you make on stocks since Nov 2016 Jim ?
3027 2018-12-29 16:43:14 #guns - Trump’s ban of bump stocks seems a clear infringement of our Constitution. I’d vote to impeach him for this abrogation of his oath to support and defend the Constitution.
3028 2018-12-29 16:42:57 send me some memes since i lost my phone and now i dont have meme stocks
3029 2018-12-29 16:42:04 Government shut down. Farmers receiving subsidies. Cabinet members leaving or being pushed out in scandal. Stocks are crazy. The Mueller investigation, Trump Foundation Investigation, Inaugural Funds Investigation, Border bullshit. This isn’t #maga nor winning. You are a failure.
3030 2018-12-29 16:41:44 I agree with @DividendMaster that #Preferred #stocks for the most part.  Pfds almost never trade with a stock but more with interest rates.  Depending on cumulative or non-cumulative dividend, you can lose your dividend but never your preference over the common.

3035 2018-12-29 16:37:08 Right after seeing the tweet I can find nothing else on my feed but how shitty jc penny is and how their stocks dropped dramatically. 
3036 2018-12-29 16:36:42 12/29  Last weeks stock rally was reportedly result of 1) Pension Funds re-balancing their portfolios.  They bought out-of-favor sectors and sold bonds.  2) thin trading during the Holiday week.  Stocks were also very oversold (10 on 10 point scale).  I'm looking to short stocks.

3038 2018-12-29 16:35:36 Do you think stocks gap up Sunday?
3039 2018-12-29 16:35:35 I'm 63; retired at 62. Plan SS at 70 so we're pulling from portfolio. Wife works part-time. Been studying personal finance for 30 years. Keep it at 60/40; 5 yrs expenses in cash/st bonds. 1/3 of stocks Int. Rebalanced in Oct and again this past week. I sure felt that gut wrench.
3040 2018-12-29 16:33:55 $1500 up 3 days. Lost $142 yesterday. Three takeaways... 
1. Don't trade high volume low priced stocks when rest of market is flat. Trade AMD instead. Need those swings!
2. Follow the plan to the T!
3. Don't test a new plan with large shares. 

Luckily mental stops reduce loss.

3042 2018-12-29 16:32:57 The stocks that you always wanted to have but couldn't, look doing much better than yours. You may tend to like what others have than what you do. The simple reason for it being you already have it.
3043 2018-12-29 16:32:55 If you read the request to the ATF, the bump stocks original purpose was to assist those with a handicap so they can enjoy those listed above and recreational shooting.  It really does not increase the rate of fire, it is cap due to bolt cycling rate.
3044 2018-12-29 16:32:14 Yes. Instead of waiting for someone like guy to come kn and manipulate. To me those stocks are a way to blow account. Not too mention ive made way more money consistently it seems playing stuff like nvda and so forth. Only been trading for about a year and half so still new
3045 2018-12-29 16:32:12 Investing is just fun to me, watching the stocks rise and fall. It's really the potential it holds.
3046 2018-12-29 16:30:51 A lot of gun channels on YouTube are crying about bump stocks being illegal now 
3047 2018-12-29 16:29:32 “If this is all we’re going to get, it is a whopping disappointment and  we are adding at least 200 million bushels to our soybean stocks,” said  Ted Seifried, chief market strategist for Chicago-based Zaner Ag Hedge.
3048 2018-12-29 16:29:29 Even for trading Fundamentals is the base.Technicals and all things were into picture only after Internet and computer Era. Fundamentals were the only hope for people who traded in early 90s. So what i wud like to say is trading on sound stocks by using their momentum is not bad.
3049 2018-12-29 16:28:56 They are simply cutting back from 20% soy feed (an exceptionally high amount) to 12% ( which is conventional in other countries). Right now, however, there are unrelated disease issues that are depressing swine stocks.

3051 2018-12-29 16:28:06 12/29 STOCKS are likely to continue to decline in the 1st Qtr of 2019 and the decline could be ugly.   1) trump angered the rest of the world.  Companies are looking to do business with non-USA based companies.  2) no answer for the MASSIVE Federal Budget Deficit.  Not good.
3052 2018-12-29 16:27:55 Another Red Herring? Fishing is a tiny industry. Most of the fish are sold to the EU. Many fishermen sell their fishing rights to EU based businesses, as it's more profitable than actually fishing. Protecting fish stocks is an international concern best managed by an independent.
3053 2018-12-29 16:27:49 Sad to say. This is big business and they can care less about the people. That have stocks to focus on and not the people. There are no cures coming either. That would bankrupt the system and place thousands out of work and close down many billion dollar companies.

3064 2018-12-29 16:21:19 My market analysis is very simple...

I have 5 scans that produce a watchlist weekly of the leaders of the current time based on fundies and TA. The list is anywhere from 15-75 stocks. I only buy from that list. It takes me 2 mins to scroll those charts and I ask 3 questions....
3065 2018-12-29 16:21:17 then why are fishing stocks low all over the world? The quotas were an attempt to limit catching without destroying the industry, that they maybe should've been lower, yes, but they would've been under huge pressure from members not to make too low

3073 2018-12-29 16:16:58 I am a person who is totally against technicals in trading..if people are strong enuf about their fundamentals for long term holdings then they shud be able to use the momentum of their long term stocks aswell by trading.This is my personal opinion..

3079 2018-12-29 16:14:16 Is this the "buyout at $420 moment?" I thought those jokers stopped playing the "Deal wth China" card?  Maybe, they must think folks are really gullible? Every weekend it is some wild BS with these guys. When will they trot out Mnuchin & Kudlow to tell us to "buy stocks?"
3080 2018-12-29 16:13:18 If there are specific stocks you follow & know well.. if you think they are “cheap” then start nibbling on them! I pound the table to buy/sell when no one wants to!

Never said ban because I don’t like. Bump stocks lower accuracy while increasing rate of fire. Seems counter to most uses of sporting/hunting/protection.

3112 2018-12-29 15:55:29 After trump wins construction company stocks went up in Mexico 
3113 2018-12-29 15:55:20 What about Dems raising taxes on corporations?  Seems obvious to me this will be done in two years.  Therefore.. What stocks to buy?  Most companies will have increase tax liability hence lower earnings per share.
3114 2018-12-29 15:55:15 Economy roaring, Stocks bulletproof, employment golden, peace contagious and border security an actual reality? President Trump is not only the greatest POTUS in this century but with another term, likely the greatest in history. #GiterDone #MAGA
3115 2018-12-29 15:52:47 Yes, put it on stocks so @realDonaldTrump can help you lose it
3116 2018-12-29 15:52:43 Is this a really a rally where only 5 to 10 stocks are just moving the Nifty and that too in rotation.
3117 2018-12-29 15:52:03 I like teaching undergraduates and working with them in the lab. Fruit flies are a great model system. However, the flies don't care that it's break and the minions (a.k.a. undergrad researchers) are away, so I'm in the lab making food (yesterday) and flipping stocks (today).
3118 2018-12-29 15:51:50 Naku kung mayaman lang ako, bibili ako ng maraming stocks sa YG at isa lang ang hihingin kong kapalit ang ako mismo maghandle sa iKON. Kukuha ako ng magaling na publicist. I will make it my mission to let the world know them.

An iKONIC’s gotta do what’s she gotta do.
3119 2018-12-29 15:49:16 Lindsey aren't you tired of getting played don't you notice the oil stocks going down just now they can finish their pipeline in Syria that's all it's ever been about
3120 2018-12-29 15:49:09 YG should have sell the konbat v2 during ikontinue tour and sell the v1 at a lower price if they were clearing stocks (prolly thats why it was sold in limited quantity during the tour and sold out everywhere else)  @ygent_official
3121 2018-12-29 15:48:14 Bump stocks banned? Wtf is wrong with you pussies!?!?! 
3122 2018-12-29 15:46:27 Personally I believe the first superintelligent advertising AI will destroy what it means to be human. The ROI even beats stocks - see Apple & Google
3123 2018-12-29 15:45:34  Have a look these #stocks that hit record highs: $GWGH
3124 2018-12-29 15:43:16 Stocks still WAY ABOVE OBAMA
3125 2018-12-29 15:43:12 Morning!
2.5 hrs studying The Complete Penney Stocks this morning. Its a marathon not a sprint.....
3126 2018-12-29 15:42:48 I took this questions seriously and I can come up with the following: Criminal justice reform, which was only signed this month. Banning bump stocks, also this month. 2 things in 7 years? How can ANYONE vote @GOP?
3127 2018-12-29 15:40:52 Running the #’s on profits since October 10th. Here’s one of the stats:

Stocks: 24% of total profits 
Options: 31% of total profits 
Futures: 45% of total profits! 

It pays to be flexible! I’m willing to give anyone a simple intro to futures if interested. $ES_F $NG_F $GC_F
3128 2018-12-29 15:39:55 Not in all cases: Google “US blocks sale of ____ to China citing security concerns.”

Foreign USD good for hotels, strip malls, stocks, USTs.  Not good for US ports, certain types of US tech, etc.
3129 2018-12-29 15:39:09 BrecherTrading clients were leaning short at 3 EST. Big SPX open interest at 2500, combined with the strength in /ZB meant to short stocks.
3130 2018-12-29 15:38:57 Have you heard about Tax Cuts to the Multi-Nationals Co. 35>23% <? they promptly bought their stocks back,and the 1% ? .. Thanks for the laugh 
3131 2018-12-29 15:38:43 I was supposed to restock ob sticker packs again bc stocks are low again (oof ty so much u guys are crazy) but after lying on the bed a bit to get my phone, I suddenly felt this huge urge to sleep lol
3132 2018-12-29 15:38:42 Maybe in developed world ex Japan/Korea. Still have 8-9 reactors idle in the former and lots of capacity being built in China. Many ppl are sleeping on coal - thermal to be specific - sizable deficit with SE Asia demand climbing and India turning the corner. Stocks printing cash.
3133 2018-12-29 15:38:07 Trying to get into stocks with the market being as low as it is. Someone help me get rich!
3134 2018-12-29 15:36:54 I like to see people speak about tech, investments, stocks/bonds, innovation, ideas, personal growth. It’s like I’m happy to see others happy.

3137 2018-12-29 15:36:24 I used it yesterday and I was able to buy more stocks with it. And I'm really impress with how my portfolio is starting to look like. And the future for me is going to look very bright. And I also plan to invest again on New Years eve as well.
3138 2018-12-29 15:34:38 $spx. BrecherTrading clients were leaning short at 3 EST yesterday, not long. Big SPX open interest at 2500, combined with the strength in /ZB meant to short stocks , not buy them.
3139 2018-12-29 15:34:34 Economy Great - STOCKS Down. Hmm.  Why. Could it be Dems recent rise of power. Could it be constant negative and anti America speech of our nation. Could it be Media constant  negative US, POTUS, anti security border wall speech. Well one constant dem liberals in control.
3140 2018-12-29 15:33:38 It’s much easier to come up with these for downward stocks and prices. “Burned up”, for example. My favorite is when soda stocks go down and the reports are “fizzed down x%”
3141 2018-12-29 15:32:16 Bump stocks are now gone
3142 2018-12-29 15:30:21 Give examples by displaying stocks charts n their names..... 
3143 2018-12-29 15:30:06 I really wish someone could teach me how to trade stocks the potential money to be made is just something crazy 
3144 2018-12-29 15:28:03 claiming stocks and being a dope financial reporter 
3145 2018-12-29 15:27:45 @RobWalster ......looking forward to you giving @adam_stocks_  a bit of stick here  go on the tigers
3146 2018-12-29 15:27:13 Next year im going to start investing money into stocks too
3147 2018-12-29 15:25:48 was starting to feel like a crazy person saying bank stocks were in trouble... those buy backs made me look like a fool for a while
3148 2018-12-29 15:25:21 I hope these weed stocks pop off in the next decade. I’m trying to be comfortable in my 30’s.
3149 2018-12-29 15:25:10 I can't understand why @HuaweiIndia mate 20pro is always out of stock.They always supply in double numbers for an entire city and say they have overwhelming response.Why can't they make it available in more stocks so that all the interested can buy this in @amazonIN @cromaretail
3150 2018-12-29 15:23:36 Hopefully she will like stoppping the illegal ban on bump stocks! They can’t just arbitrarily change previously passed legislation.
3151 2018-12-29 15:20:14 I think that sums it up. He's not just a conman, but an epic failure as well. Whether he was selling nasal spray or penny stocks, or making movies almost no one watched. I think he got rich from people paying him to go away.
3152 2018-12-29 15:17:52 Bought in $30s and sold during the melt-up.  Nearly 10x.  Utility is the new value when looking at stocks.  Brand equity is the new predictable revenue
3153 2018-12-29 15:17:45 1) while the trade war has certainly impacted Chinese stocks, no serious expert would deny other, likely-bigger domestic factors at play there.
2) focusing on only direct tariff costs & envisioning seamless switching is amateurish drivel

3156 2018-12-29 15:16:34 Or, the first (and less intelligent than superintelligent) AI that successfully trades stocks will stop humanity in its tracks.
3157 2018-12-29 15:15:17 Do you trade mostly mid and large cap stocks?  Not that penny stock and low price momo action.
3158 2018-12-29 15:14:47 People are quick to point out Crypto losing value, but are silent on the 15% decline of stocks since September 
3159 2018-12-29 15:13:50 Definitely agree it can fall more, but even then a consistent purchase schedule, of diversified DGI stocks or low expense index funds, will benefit investors. Average cost and DRIP becomes our best friend. Timing the market is a failing strategy.
3160 2018-12-29 15:13:23 Bump stocks were just banned. 

And yea they are acquired from legal owners, by .. guess what? Theft

3163 2018-12-29 15:11:22 Interesting. Im guessing, you think that because its a measurable tangible asset. But also has a lot of unknown variables, political factors making it potentially volatile from one day to the next I am sure you do well trading it.I personally  just rather other types of stocks.
3164 2018-12-29 15:11:11 Nice one

"Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don’t think of it as the beginning of ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same” – Peter Lynch
3165 2018-12-29 15:09:37 If you want to buy penny stocks and sell it back to them at exorbitant prices, promising pie in the sky stuff then by all means do so. Trump did.
3166 2018-12-29 15:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
3167 2018-12-29 15:08:30 Of course but there's a time delay to that & maybe some will be sold or re-let before it makes a serious dent in the value &/or yield of a diversified #property portfolio. As ever, the facts of the matter will surely be more nuanced than black & white headlines suggest.
3168 2018-12-29 15:07:47 AMERICA!,DON'T LET LIBS TELL YOU THIS IS WORSER STOCKS,,TRUTH TOLD,,STOCK MKTS ARE FINE,,DOING GOOD AS ECON GOOD,,PEOPLE BUY NOW,,AND GROW:)
3169 2018-12-29 15:07:10 I still have stocks of those
3170 2018-12-29 15:06:58 Given that we are probably headed towards a recession, I think it makes sense to start researching the best stocks/industries to invest in during a downturn. First up: discount retailers. I am doing an analysis of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Five Below.
3171 2018-12-29 15:05:38 They wouldnt care and a liberal judge would overturn it. He needs to shut down the border. It will hit the Congress in the pocketbook with all the stocks they own in the companies they have in Mexico. One thing holds true. Congress will do what makes them richer.
3172 2018-12-29 15:05:35 I wonder how the stocks are doing since that energy attack in new york?
3173 2018-12-29 15:04:57 Rachel, what doll is this??? It's too cute!!! I haven't this around!!
3174 2018-12-29 15:04:30 If this is Socialism, THANK GOD! 1st up: high-speed rail networks that bring us out of the Dark Ages and up to European Transportation standards. 2nd: Healthcare for all
3rd: Gun violence. Oh wait... Trump is already confiscating your Bump stocks. 
3175 2018-12-29 15:04:24 People just have to be smart with there Money and put it in the right stocks . Some loved him when the market was up to highs and now hate him when it's low .
3176 2018-12-29 15:02:35 The Venezuelan Gov's "Rabbit Farming" programme to tackle famine is obviously not working. 

Maybe not enough food to keep the stocks alive long enough? 
3177 2018-12-29 15:01:17 Willing to bet that they're not going to get any bump stocks either.
3178 2018-12-29 15:00:47 Lindsey, you are just moments away from having all your dirt exposed. You know that, right? Your choices are to get ahead of it or let it drag you down. Personally, I'd prefer the latter, because I think all Russian stooges should be tarred and feathered, then put into stocks.

3190 2018-12-29 14:45:53 Have we overcome bear market when 60-70% stocks under performing the index?
3191 2018-12-29 14:45:40 & I know I'm violating NNT's rules on risk, but I'm in line with his value of SITG. If I'm going to talk positively about the market, then I should act on that. Plus, I feel even better about it knowing that Trump and Adams both touted stocks the next day. So far, so good. :)
3192 2018-12-29 14:45:30 HHAHAHAAHAH tae limited stocks lang nga
3193 2018-12-29 14:45:06 More important. How about the corporations quit rebuying their own stocks. Manipulations to please board mbrs & #wallstreet. Originally Occupy Democrats had it right protesting banks (central banks & FR) then they lost focus & horribly went off the rails. #SchumerPelosiShutdown
3194 2018-12-29 14:44:58 Di ito stocks kind of investment. Haha. Pero spontaneous kong binili itong sinasabi kong investment kaya pinagdarasal 
3195 2018-12-29 14:43:31 The stock market is a place where rich elites invest their money - it's in correction mode.

The job market is where poor and middle class Americans go to make money - it's booming.

So why is rich elite @jimcarrey so obsessed with stocks and silent about the job market?

Oops.
3196 2018-12-29 14:42:55 Are you going there? While you're at it, may you please check if there are stocks for RJ and Cooky standing doll, and whose characters are available for 42cm? Thanks love, Ingat 
3197 2018-12-29 14:42:19 no, if we could get price stability up here, would come back some; but as seen, just low vix actually reduces volume.  the other way to look at it is if 1T$ trades each day, if the prices are 1/2; might see 2x the volume.  you see the volume increase in stocks that have crashed
3198 2018-12-29 14:42:17 So. What’s your point. Mnuchin is setting the stocks on fire from Cabo! @realDonaldTrump is just pissed off he has played golf over Christmas. 
Run down every member of Congress and tell us where they are before you chastise any individual.

3205 2018-12-29 14:31:51 U.S. stocks are not in a bear market.  The S&P 500 has not closed 20% below its closing high (bear market definition).  At its lowest recent close, it was 19.8% below its high.  Only 7 of the previous 13 bear markets since World War II have resulted in a recession.

3208 2018-12-29 14:30:55 @IrregularChoice hi, my mum got me vouchers online for your store, thinking the local shop thst stocks your shoes would accept them... tje shoes I'm in love with aren't on your site...is it possible to get a refund on the voucher, so I can buy them in the shop instead please?
3209 2018-12-29 14:28:53 I don’t hardly ever respond to investment articles.  In fact, this may be a first.  However, you article entitled “U.S. Retirees Try to Keep Coolas Stocks Tumble” way more than hit the nail on the head.  All through this piece, I could have replaced my name with others.
3210 2018-12-29 14:28:05 He don’t care. Him and Mnuchin made a bundle of money on stocks fall and rise recently. Basically why the prez. was jollical and in good disposition yesterday as reported.
3211 2018-12-29 14:28:02 Brent data is only available monthly. I update it more often as EIA, OPEC or IEA estimates of OECD stocks are published. I have not posted it outside of individual posts on my website but it's an idea I will consider with my web designer. @alexbulman

3219 2018-12-29 14:23:34 I saw them outside Tromsø for my first time.  I’m not a spiritual man, but my goodness, I felt like weeping and falling to my knees in silent celestial awe.
3220 2018-12-29 14:23:14 In a time when that was considered usual practice... you can’t judge historical figures based on actions that today are abhorred. People also used to be locked in stocks and had fruit and veg thrown at them by people all day for something as little as having an opinion...
3221 2018-12-29 14:22:38 This evening I finally found a music store that stocks hundreds of CDs by bands I love. Had to go to Japan to find it. Browsing through the shelves was a lot more fun than browsing through iTunes, as convenient as that has been.
3222 2018-12-29 14:22:07 I think it very much luck if they come out to play whilst here. We arrived and saw them first night and they came out again 2nd night. Been snowing all day today so not hopeful this evening, but you just don’t know!

3225 2018-12-29 14:20:36 Now with the balance sheet falling (along with stocks and yield curve slope) the US economy will slow--it already is--and that will mean 10 year yield convergence down to the rest of the world. Less hiked=less BELIEF in inflation. Watch and see.
3226 2018-12-29 14:20:14 Je vais directement en market place pour éviter se genre de problème... les stocks en lignes sont malheureusement partagés avec les stocks magasins donc il y a pas mal d’erreurs dû à l’actualisation

3228 2018-12-29 14:19:11 With so many artist in the music game I wonder if its  driving the genres stocks down or is it thriving because of social platforms?
3229 2018-12-29 14:17:31 Learning how to be confident, not cocky, and knowing the difference; managing your money and inventing/stocks; emotional management and being able to move on from being hurt without wanting to seek revenge; tapping into your talents; knowing how to be a leader...
3230 2018-12-29 14:16:03 The stock market has been red but the weed stocks been green, no pun intended.

3255 2018-12-29 13:50:26 Dollar cost averaging into an index (or mutual fund) is more powerful than most people realize and is far more effective than picking stocks or timing the market - that's one of the essential keys to a long term retirement plan.

3278 2018-12-29 13:27:25 If the current market is so bad, why does Obama take credit for it? 

Interest rates were low during Obama (.25% to .75%), but have rose to 2.5% under Trump. That's why stocks had a halfway decent run under Obama.
3279 2018-12-29 13:25:56 I believe I speak for all of America's tax payers when I suggest that when @realDonaldTrump is convicted for multiple crimes relating to #Treason, he should not cost us even more by being housed in federal prison. Being placed in stocks in a public square would serve #Justice.
3280 2018-12-29 13:25:27 You guys are in the business of recommending stocks.  If you recommend 200 stocks a year, I would HOPE one of them performs like Netflix or Tesla...
3281 2018-12-29 13:24:19 The original tweet uses an insanely broad brush and lazily extrapolates to make a point. I find it cheap and divisive. And it simply isn't how the world works. For example, Obama didn't come for gun owners' bump stocks - Trump did.
3282 2018-12-29 13:23:10 They are somewhat useful, however, stocks & bonds are just paper wealth not real wealth, as real wealth is cash in bank. Most billionaire are billionaire only on paper, not in real wealth
3283 2018-12-29 13:21:33 Don’t buy the car, don’t save liquid cash. Having cash just laying around for no reason is actually more harmful. Find the right time to invest that cash into stocks.

3309 2018-12-29 12:47:13 Suspected pre-season that the competition this summer would be lower-scoring than usual, for nothing more than the dearth of batting talent in Australia atm relative to the bowling stocks. 

Personally prefer a balanced game, think it's important that bowlers can have impact.

3371 2018-12-29 11:13:27 My new Naproxen prescription can't be fulfilled, and Erythromycin is one of the antibiotics I can take. (I have a Penicillin allergy.) Luckily I don't need antibiotics right now.
Both drugs are either out of stock or critically low in stocks.
3372 2018-12-29 11:13:26 It’s great. Finally. No one needs bump stocks to hunt or in self defense. When a country does the right thing, you hear silence. It’s only when the country is off course, you hear protests.

3384 2018-12-29 10:44:45 @wiseguy151 the risk with PE stocks to me is that their dividends depend on their ability to successfully exit positions. But even so the sector has been unloved for a long time. People remember the BX IPO in 2007 rather than the company’s comeback after the crisis

3390 2018-12-29 10:35:13 I thought the tube launched TLAM had been discontinued? With RN managing the final stocks.

So perhaps SSN(R) will have vertical launch?
3391 2018-12-29 10:32:53 Enjoyed the latest on @realvision @ttmygh @RaoulGMI . It’s the small stuff. How many SME owners take dividends, invest in listed stocks and then lose money? As you pointed out in passing, investing in “yourself” or your own business is a much under-rated strategy?
3392 2018-12-29 10:32:05 ya know if you have good publicity your stocks would do great and it would make your stock not risky that's why shareholders are so uptight
3393 2018-12-29 10:31:15 @jypnation hello sir , I’m going to need you to give your artists a break ! Not to be rude but your stocks would probably go up with them being gone . Also give @day6official promotions! Goodnight sir <3 and I mean all artists ! Thank u

Sis, if the NYSE closed it’s doors  on Monday, how will shareholders get their money back in the absence of cash from new investors?

There has to be a way “if” stocks are real property with real value

3402 2018-12-29 10:16:44 I don’t know how you keep backing the @NRA especially after they gave away the stupid bump stocks that turned thousands of Americans into potential felons.  I guess if I was paid millions I’d be ok with destroying part of constitution as well.
3403 2018-12-29 10:10:21 Very intresting  I like it! But i think shareholders need cash + stocks if they going to leave tsx and nyse, atleast i need cash to approve that

3410 2018-12-29 10:05:41 Thank you. I hope you had a good Christmas and that your stocks of fancy socks were replenished 
3411 2018-12-29 10:05:23 ...which had nothing to do with the stock itself. Price volume usually doesn't lie. Right now we have plenty of stocks showing this exact volume signature due to expiration and a short trading day. But price action is also important and the setups that I mnentioned look good.
3412 2018-12-29 09:57:59 Well said

3435 2018-12-29 09:26:38 As for the fishing industry...there is no getting away from quota based fishing to ensure stocks replenish. Fair enough if we don't want to share our waters. But don't expect others to share nicely either.

3443 2018-12-29 09:15:17 So that is also part of my question:

pfd shares are in the middle of common and bonds but closer to bonds than to common.

I always thought of pfd shares as bonds that trade as stocks

Are either of these valid statements?
3444 2018-12-29 09:13:58 @CNBCJou i couldn’t understand the message. Which stocks? US? Also if carry is king(assuming cash is king), how can stocks do well? Weaker dollar depends on FED rate hikes. IMHO there will be 2 hikes contrary to popular belief.

3483 2018-12-29 08:31:32 I'm not railing on you btw.
Most peeps would say bump stocks are garbage for accuracy. Its just fun to shoot, more or less.
But banning them sets a precedent to ban other items, like I mentioned; nevermind that its punishing all legal owners for the actions of 1 person.

I expect the the secular bear trend in real terms to resume and continue for almost the entire next decade.

3492 2018-12-29 08:21:44 if we can align incentive of independent director ( forced him to buy stocks as proof of skin in game) or make tenure and compensation as function of small investor satisfaction score ( recored by independent agency every Q) then may be be we can make 'work' for smal investor.

3505 2018-12-29 08:01:08 I don’t see this article as click bait.. it’s just talking about profit (revenue - expense)... stocks have nothing to do with it ..it’s not talking about operating profits .. that’s different.. your confusing urself
3506 2018-12-29 08:00:54 I’ve ran into multiple people that have 2 stocks 3 minutes. Like WTF!?

3513 2018-12-29 07:48:48 Excellent....have used similar strategy for few stocks (long cash position) using Bollinger bands ADX volatility spurt.....after consolidation and low volatility many stocks give breakout with volatility blast...

3515 2018-12-29 07:47:08 I mean half of the people who call themselves socialists including Matt Bruneg literally think that Reagan's proposal for worker "ownership" through owning stocks is socialism so I understand the confusion
3516 2018-12-29 07:46:26 So, increasing salaries in Mexico should start keeping Mexicans in Mexico.Equal trade rates brings more $$ into our treasurer.Tariffs are tough.But, it has to be done.Losing 800 billion in 1 yr is ridiculous to China & EU. More $$ in treasury to pay debt.Tariffs solved, stocks=up
3517 2018-12-29 07:45:04 And Spaghetti dinners... Ragu stocks would plummet if we got universal healthcare...
3518 2018-12-29 07:43:56 tbh I'm 100% expecting some company to make "80%" ready stocks which in turn can have a part added to it to make it a "bump stock". where, sense its seperate items, its not legally a bump stock.

Like how they do with 80% lower recievers that people finish themselves.
3519 2018-12-29 07:43:34 apple stocks rise by 69%.
3520 2018-12-29 07:43:33 Penny Stocks are a Safer Bet.
3521 2018-12-29 07:42:06 Stocks are just a claim on a part of the future profits of a corporation.

Corporate profits are too high and growing too quickly compared to wages.

Rectifying this will inevitably cause a stock market crash.
3522 2018-12-29 07:39:59 Google Finance Excel returns the wrong Market cap for Indian stocks. I tried the following function : 
GoogleFinance("VEDL", "marketcap") and it returns something like 4K while the actual value should be 74K
3523 2018-12-29 07:39:16 yee. Bump stocks are pure garbage.
That said its unconstitutional to outright ban them.
Nevermind that it gives a precedent to ban basically anything else on a gun.

They wanna ban scopes, pistol grips, specialty triggers? go for it now. more or less.
3524 2018-12-29 07:37:52 But don’t get rid of bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons after someone uses one to kill more than 50 Americans? Your desire to try to “protect” us seems highly selective and nonsensical.
3525 2018-12-29 07:35:42 Ah, yes. That classic working class struggle of deciding which stocks to add to your portfolio.

3556 2018-12-29 07:02:21 America would fucking tank if he did that. Please don’t give him any ideas. I’m in Canada but i rather not have my family continue to lose money in stocks. It’s getting uncomfortable now.

3565 2018-12-29 06:47:55 I like to get in as early as possible in commodity price moves.  To me that's where the money is made. With stocks more conservative. Picked up a short position in Nat Gas on Wednesday.

3567 2018-12-29 06:47:23 The progress of America is falsely being measured on the performance of the stocks instead of human-centred decisions in congress. The fact that there is a shut down means the US is not making headway. Pride goes before a fall. Watch it!

3622 2018-12-29 05:58:25 First of all everyone wants border security. I lived in az for 10 years! Do you know why we were in Syria? Do you know why we play world cops? Were you born after 9/11?  Lol what do you know about bump stocks..?

3624 2018-12-29 05:55:10 People control stocks. What type of people have money? What age group are they?
3625 2018-12-29 05:55:07 Border security, putting the American people first, pulling out of Syria, he's done some things I don't agree with like banning bump stocks but for the most part I agree with his policies
3626 2018-12-29 05:54:41 Its high time to buy their stocks
3627 2018-12-29 05:54:04 People control stocks. Think to yourself before buying a stock, “Is this something people will invest in?” If the answer is no, so is yours.

3638 2018-12-29 05:43:23 Oh yeah.  The Chinese just suspend trading on stocks if they start to fall.  Reliable
3639 2018-12-29 05:41:34 American companies stocks. That must make you so mad.
3640 2018-12-29 05:40:43 Okay quick question, what’s yalls views on investing in start ups or stocks?
3641 2018-12-29 05:39:26 It’s usually not that expensive!! I always import shit straight from korea/china/japan because the final price including shipping would be much cheaper than buying the “ready stocks items” in any country I’ve lived in.
3642 2018-12-29 05:39:22 You need to let me teach you how to trade these stocks and currency!
3643 2018-12-29 05:36:55 Pm po tayo for inquiries
Limited stocks lang po yan
3644 2018-12-29 05:36:18 I’d go with investing in bonds, it’s a guarantied money back but it’s low returns cause of its being a low risk. stocks always fluctuate, so money return varies.
3645 2018-12-29 05:35:35 I'm pro all the blue collars not showing up for work at mass for a week so the white collars will feel the pain of extreme economic lose when their stocks fucking tank due to uncertainty. No amount of chasing the numbers or dragons is going to unfuck America.
3646 2018-12-29 05:34:33 Corporate tax cuts = big buybacks to prop up stock price. Most of the money is spent on pumping on company stocks rather than create employment.  What a waste of money. Pump that tax rate back up and ban bringing in cheap labor from abroad.Force those corporations to spend on USA
3647 2018-12-29 05:31:11 Y los inventarios de Petro en Wallstreet (stocks) ?
3648 2018-12-29 05:31:10 Amen! They should have 4 year term limits, make what I make as a Deputy Sheriff 20+ years. I make 55,000.00, pay for their insurance like I do. When they retire get a pension like I will.
Their children do not get to go to college for free. No inside trading of stocks....
3649 2018-12-29 05:31:01 Speculation stocks should only be traded with daily users.
3650 2018-12-29 05:30:33 Wow! Just maybe some of these dirtbags need to be reminded that it was the Republicans that are coming after the bump stocks and not the Democrats. so could it be the Republicans coming after the f****** Nerf guns now I mean they are getting a little nervous with Mueller around
3651 2018-12-29 05:30:14 s is racist to have the death penalty for anyone entering Maine for the  purposes of selling drugs even though the dealers are disproportional  black and Hispanic and many here illegally even if it would save far  more lives than banning bump stocks?
3652 2018-12-29 05:29:58 what about beef and bible stocks?
3653 2018-12-29 05:28:43 Invest in Robinhood stocks which might make the decision easier bc your money is going somewhere

3660 2018-12-29 05:21:00 Let the tech stocks fall like domino's. The whole stock market is fake rigged  game.
3661 2018-12-29 05:13:56 Do any of the American people think that maybe Trump makes these crazy statements just to make the stock market drop. Then he has people buy up low priced stock for him. Then he changes his mind. Stocks go back up. Bing bam boom. He makes a few more million.
3662 2018-12-29 05:13:11 Despite the rally, $XBI has been stuck with less than 15% of stocks above the 21D for 9 days in a row. This metric has barely budged in the rally (from 4 to 9%).  Historically, multi-hits in Jan/Feb 16 (ugghh to ok by end), 1 hit in Aug 2011 (good), multis in 03/09 (great), 09/08
3663 2018-12-29 05:11:54 I’m tryna reflect on my stocks today but shit too blurry atm.
3664 2018-12-29 05:10:03 Defiance Silver and ValOro Resources stocks soar on merger: Vancouver-based juniors Defiance Silver Corp. (TSXV: DEF) and… @environmentguru
3665 2018-12-29 05:09:25 Think because the Indian international fund is invested primarily in FANG stocks which have corrected sharply this year. Also the funds never will take a naked currency position, it will always be hedged...
3666 2018-12-29 05:09:18 Check out @SiamKidd - very good online and offline, the real deal and very genuine across crypto, stocks, shares etc
3667 2018-12-29 05:08:30 and they can’t just “make bigger stocks”. it’s not as easy as u think. they can’t just say or can u make ten thousand more pls. no u cant bc they have to make batches and batches and make sure every one of them r equal quality and obviously not all of them r gonna be the same.
3668 2018-12-29 05:08:17 Thybulle's stocks are crazy
3669 2018-12-29 05:07:42 Go give my bro @BrianLeeTrades a follow, I talked about my R compounding method in chat previously.. well he took it to a whole other level! From a normal dude to outsizing your gurus and making stocks bounce!

Much love bro, awesome job
3670 2018-12-29 05:05:32 Standing tall ? He took a nine year growing economy to the brink , stocks are fluttering, deficits rising, fed tightening, and yeah close our border and rip up trade deals is exactly what we need 
3671 2018-12-29 05:04:06 Graham says that there is no such things as a good or bad stock; there are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best company become sell when it's stock price goes too high, while the worst company is worth buying if it's price goes low enough. 
#intelligentinvestor
3672 2018-12-29 05:03:58 Might be for stocks. Options are 1 day settlement. So sell today, $ rdy in the morning! You’re just limited to beginning cash for the day. But don’t have to worry about getting flagged.
3673 2018-12-29 05:02:45 Oh he can run. Laughing stocks can do what they want just like the rest of us 
3674 2018-12-29 05:01:35 Really like his versatility on D think his stocks are being suppressed by uva’s system think on O i believe the shot he’ll be able to attack close outs and pass on move above avg
3675 2018-12-29 05:00:55 What did Jim Bunning do besides a perfect game, another no hitter, and contributing to bring a usually hapless team oh-so-close to the pennant one year? Did his time in politics help?
3676 2018-12-29 05:00:00 Does the news affect the bitcoin price?

Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol with no central authority involved. Bitcoin is no different from any other investments like stocks and bonds, so the probability of Bitcoin affected by the news is present.

#Bitcoin #cryptocurrencies
3677 2018-12-29 04:58:49 You just dispelled what I long suspected. A lot of “experts” have long stated “innovation” as justification for why some stocks are sky high. More questions raised with that response. Thank you Jonathan
3678 2018-12-29 04:58:08 I was originally surprised when Stargell got elected, thinking he lucked in on a small market team that won 2 WS and made other postseasons, but I've since read up on him and now agree with selection.
3679 2018-12-29 04:58:07 I think all of you guys are wrong. The bull market is just getting started. The stock market doesn’t behave like crypto, other forces are driving it. These forces make it clear that stocks are good way higher. If you are short, I feel sorry for you. Be careful out there.
3680 2018-12-29 04:57:54 Black mirror...we need to buy stocks in Netflix 
3681 2018-12-29 04:57:36 I started to learn about stocks and such. I survived the Camp Fire here in california with my family. I started my job that I love.
3682 2018-12-29 04:57:06 IF they had bought stocks on weds and Thursday they would have shouted it from the rooftops and put a line in the sand ..
3683 2018-12-29 04:56:51 Trump banned bump stocks. That’s a start.
3684 2018-12-29 04:56:15 One point on this...the fed selling assets doesn’t force any buyers. People just choose to allocate capital to less risky treasuries, which lowers the price of risky assets like stocks. I don’t think it’s a bad thing if asset prices decline from record highs instead of crashing
3685 2018-12-29 04:56:01 Defiance Silver and ValOro Resources stocks soar on merger: Vancouver-based juniors Defiance Silver Corp. (TSXV: DEF) and… @environmentguru
3686 2018-12-29 04:56:00 I think the idea is that index funds outperform active management because of lower fees and markets are efficient anyway. It’s not an argument that index funds or stocks as a class automatically appreciate.
3687 2018-12-29 04:54:54 A lot of Japanese wealth evaporated by home bias. Would have been better off global diversified. 

Might we see the same for US investors? Lots of people with 100% of their equity in US stocks when global market cap weighted is probably closer to 50%.
3688 2018-12-29 04:52:25 But you are already seeing some signs that the tightening is having an effect on housing/real estate with these drops in homes sales.  And stocks could fade.  The million dollar question is what happens to HH wealth in the next six months and how that effects spending/investment.
3689 2018-12-29 04:52:03 How can so many smart people have eth conviction? Heavy bags i guess. Ive been wrecked in enough stocks over the years to let go when im fundamentally wrong. It took a lot of pain. If i see that bitcoin will fail ill take the L and move on. Tough year but fundamentals strong
3690 2018-12-29 04:50:42 (Good.  I hope he does it so they can kick him out faster.  He's seriously done nothing for this country...he's undone every good thing Obama ever did...he's making the stocks fall constantly...I have no idea why anyone ever voted for him...and he just needs to go already.)
3691 2018-12-29 04:49:36 We're home for the message - and let me know when they bring stocks back.
3692 2018-12-29 04:49:33 Tonight, I will share my entire 39-stock #dividend portfolio on YouTube! Get ready!  #investing #stocks
3693 2018-12-29 04:49:15 I think people are expecting some sudden econ. collapse b/c ES is down 6.6% yoy.  It’s doesn’t work that way.  Stocks could come back and that isn’t much of a “collapse”.  House prices still going up too.  HH wealth barely budged.  Issue is effect of tightening going forward.
3694 2018-12-29 04:45:16 U should rather stop gathering boyfriends like stocks, cos if u think they won't know then u will b living in a false paradise
3695 2018-12-29 04:44:40 And yet companies receive tax cuts & buy back stocks and fired executives still receive golden parachutes. Ridiculous!!! Aren’t there many positions left unfilled? Shouldn’t that alone save money? Cut back the pay of all those rich administrators he’s hired! Cut from top first!!!
3696 2018-12-29 04:44:29 Makes me want to bail out of fossil fuel stocks
3697 2018-12-29 04:39:56 It was an Obama hold out who raised the interest rates that started the decline in stocks, NIMROD!

3710 2018-12-29 04:26:55 At the same time
There should have been a reciprocity carry introduced

If your fixing the system
Instead it’s viewed as more restriction

So I am against your bill banning bump stocks because it is rigging the system
3711 2018-12-29 04:26:24 //Ya altoke, 3 stocks, hazards off, en dreamland, yo escojo al Rey Dedede (?

Okno xD
3712 2018-12-29 04:25:37 Not true.  Stocks peaked way before the u-3  bottomed in 2000.
3713 2018-12-29 04:25:28 Move to Warracknabeal, our local Newsagent stocks it (which kind of surprised me but also showed me how times have changed).
3714 2018-12-29 04:24:57 I had always heard about stocks from the news shows, the papers, but what I needed to do was take "stock" in myself.
3715 2018-12-29 04:23:06 Or we just put them all in the public stocks when this is over as a warning to future racist collaborators
3716 2018-12-29 04:21:43 RRSPS are the biggest mistake you will ever make.  Pay your taxes now, because when you retire the taxes will kill you. Put your money in savings, NOT stocks.

3719 2018-12-29 04:20:40 Ralph ‘ at Prudential you called for Nasdaq 6,000. It was at the height of the bubble in tech stocks. NDAQ was at 5,050. You were obviously dead wrong. Hang it up !!! 
3720 2018-12-29 04:18:18 @AskRobinhood I'm new to the app, 5 of the stocks I own had ex dividend dates of today that those dividends aren't showing. Do I need to wait for the recording date for them to show on the app?
3721 2018-12-29 04:17:36 If you are 5% in crypto and 90% in stocks, that may not be a true statement 
3722 2018-12-29 04:15:51 They banned bump stocks for one mass murder but do nothing when illegals kill our citizens. Better build the wall or We The People will have open season on illegals.

Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you're still an idiot.

3726 2018-12-29 04:14:27 Thanx a lot for  valuable guidance.
1. Do not hold Options too long.
2. Do not average options which turned negative
3. Use VIX as an indicator to have decision to buy CE / PE
4. Buy only NIFTY stocks CE/PE
3727 2018-12-29 04:14:02 Mr Ford is the best. Always listened when he was on Larry Kudlow’s old radio show. On 12.26, I had a meeting w my financial advisor and I bought some more quality stocks such as UPS, CAT, John Deere.  
3728 2018-12-29 04:13:29 Yeah too bad none of us really have the time and patience to watch these stocks really play out where you can catch a big winner no matter what the stock, look at $vktx from 1-27 and then 7 again. Need to take profits regularly
3729 2018-12-29 04:12:51 does the good athlete OR creating stocks/boards apply to any of our ripe-for-hand-wringing megastuds, steph/harden/luka? i know now the narrative says Harden=outlier strong and Steph very quick, but those were decidedly not said pre-them being stars

3730 2018-12-29 04:12:02 Remember when private prison stocks skyrocketed after Trump became President. His buddies are making a lot of money.

3732 2018-12-29 04:11:35 I use Etrade just because I always have. I've heard good things about Interactive Brokers (they pay good interest on idle cash) and Trade Station. Also a lot of people are using Robinhood because it's free.  If just trading stocks though, they're all pretty similar.
3733 2018-12-29 04:10:34 So is investing in funds a good or to buy stocks directly?? What would you recommend....
3734 2018-12-29 04:10:29 Actually they DID repay it, with interest and early. The loss you're referring to was in Treasury held stocks. Not GM's fault!

Whoops!

LOL

Another lie to defend Chuckles stupid post.

3735 2018-12-29 04:06:53 Deutsche Bank bought Banker Trust in 1999 and with it Trumps loans. That’s the only reason Trump had to deal with them!

3746 2018-12-29 03:55:59 A @CNBC Guest said there are only 3600 stocks (NYSE & NASDAQ) that #ETFs can invest in. $3.6 Trillion worth of Passively Managed ETFs or the $61.9 Billion of Actively Managed ETFs deciding to re-balance to look good in Yr End Stock Reports would cause Volatility apolitically no?
3747 2018-12-29 03:55:23 If I got a time machine, first stop would be to hit some stocks and lottery numbers, second stop would be hitting that messy Champion and FILA clearance pile at K-Mart in '97 for that 2018 resale value, bruh.
3748 2018-12-29 03:54:15 Let's continue with bully mentality and wonder why more Americans hate politicians. Sure Trump made millions on stocks this week why most suffered
3749 2018-12-29 03:53:28 Et on n'a pas besoin de faire venir un PDG pour cela. On déploie une équipe de contrôle qui fera des prélèvements dans les stocks disponibles. Suivant les résultats du contrôle, on décide. On parle de la quasi-totalité de la population quand même

3751 2018-12-29 03:51:20 Hi! Will try to get stocks for January batch, pero tentative stocks pa dear hehe 
3752 2018-12-29 03:49:55 I think the worst part about losing a game 3 where I was at 25% w/ 2 stocks, while my opponent was at 90% last stock is the fact that this man deadass asked me if I want a Sprite Cranberry before we started playing.
3753 2018-12-29 03:49:30 I had a quick look and some of my stocks are up +20% from the low, did I miss the bottom? Bull trap? All the sophs are "still in cash"? Lol
3754 2018-12-29 03:49:11 "Stocks are too cheap!" I hear this from the talking heads on TV. This is according to current earnings estimates? What if growth slows, and earnings are reduced?Can they get cheaper?  I have learned not to fight the markets...
3755 2018-12-29 03:48:50 That’s correct, assuming you’re not a long only manager or buy and hold investor who over-weighted equities b/c you know... stocks only go up.

Volatile Stocks Test Investors’ ResolveThe Dow industrials changed direction 19 times before ending the day down 0.3%, a fitting coda to a week marked by sharp plunges and euphoric rises. The blue-chip index and S&P 500 are on track for their worst month 09.

3764 2018-12-29 03:41:07 north korean stocks,  bit volatile
3765 2018-12-29 03:40:56 Depends on the company. Stocks like $CWEB and $CVSI would be more sensitive to such news. Probably some pump in that news in terms of cost (i.e. does it include excise/duties on N.A. imports). Either way, CBD oil costs are coming much lower with #FarmBill + LATAM setup. How much?

3771 2018-12-29 03:34:21 Hearing baby boomers talk about how crazy it is that "millennials" lose money on stocks in things like renewables.

It is hilarious (...scary) that they can't grasp trying to create a better future over making money now.

3777 2018-12-29 03:29:42 How fast main stream media changes their bias? One day #crypto is a bubble and scam...next day it's correlating strongly with gold when stocks struggle. Maybe they're preparing for stock market crash and pumping crypto.

That is probably the greatest ROI possible

3808 2018-12-29 03:00:12 I tend to become interested in stocks that by their very names or circumstances inspire an unwillingness - and an 'ick' accompanied by a wrinkle of the nose - on the part of most investors to delve any further. -- Michael Burry

3813 2018-12-29 02:57:07 We had a horrible recession in the late 80s. Those tax cuts to business went back to investors, not people. You don’t remember that?  Plus, the portfolio managers were selling stocks to bet on other stocks , junk bonds!  You’ll see. It’ll happen again.

3826 2018-12-29 02:45:33 Lots of tweets about Chicago PMI.  Strong number for sure.  But as irrelevant as Richmond Fed. Coincident data is basically all good.  Stock selloffs and monetary tightenings are always lag effects.  In 2000, Chicago PMI fell 25 points in nine months after stocks peaked.
3827 2018-12-29 02:44:42 @TFT_ #NajamSethi #Livingdangerously. This two bit rabblerouser cant see the 30% massacre in US Stocks and most of the world. IMF has been brought to heel. No financial shortfall. Dreams on Exxon Mobil. Reforms galore. The corrupt in death throes.
3828 2018-12-29 02:44:20 The Democrats are about to take the House and stocks start dropping. Coincidence?
3829 2018-12-29 02:44:00 I think they keep adding first press stocks. I followed that last night and the stocks always sell out fast and then go back to 9-12 copies. But it was last night so 
3830 2018-12-29 02:42:13 Most retirees are in CD with 2% and going up. Only fools are still in stocks. People should be moving to cash in their 401k months ago.
3831 2018-12-29 02:41:40 But they actually don't. After the Fed's raised rates they looked at the market considered the trade war used figures and poof recession. I couldn't believe it due to way stocks on Thursday rebounded but was told by my financial advisor (family) people were buying sold off stocks
3832 2018-12-29 02:40:40 GM shareholders had their stocks wiped out when that happened too. But, that only affected rich people. Not retirees...

3834 2018-12-29 02:39:00 GST has eliminated road block of different tax barriers such as check posts & toll plazas leading to wastage of unpreserved items during transport. This penalty used to transform into major costs due to higher need of buffer stock  & warehousing stocks. 
#GstTransformsBharat
3835 2018-12-29 02:38:21 GM is following the capitalist playbook....lobby for tax breaks, get tax break, don’t raise wages, buy back stocks, move factories to cheaper labor..... executives and GM officers get rich.

3839 2018-12-29 02:37:54 Well, do you have any of your retirement money in stocks? They've been plunged.
And there have been massive layoffs.
3840 2018-12-29 02:37:24 Just convinced my relatives that rallying is not a bad thing, that the UP Quality education should not stay in UP alone but to all state U, that the govt wants us to stay dumb, and that they (and all Filipinos) should learn economics and invest in stocks. Good morning

3843 2018-12-29 02:36:08 1/2 False equivalence. I'm not suggesting that an investor try to time the market. Valuation exists in context. For example, its why Buffett keeps repeating that stocks look cheap IF interest rates stay low... 
3844 2018-12-29 02:35:36 BUMP STOCKS are ARMS.  ARMS are BUMP STOCKS.  Any questions?
3845 2018-12-29 02:35:19 I do believe it prompted Trump to ban bump stocks. That’s more than any Democrat has done. Tell me, why didn’t Obama do that?
3846 2018-12-29 02:33:52 It would be interesting to see our wtf stocks haha. I might do mine later too.
3847 2018-12-29 02:32:29 ... AND (4) Snap’s userbase still pails in comparison to IG & FB. The storm for Snap is only starting. There are simply a ton of better investment options with solid fundamentals - such as Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix & other FAANG stocks
3848 2018-12-29 02:32:09 I think the minimum should be that you either sell the stocks (on the market, not to your relatives), or don't qualify.
In the long run though, the stock market should be phased out and the corporations should be transitioned to workers owned cooperatives.
3849 2018-12-29 02:31:12 Where are McConnell & Ryan? Ryan over at K st. with Boehner teeing up POT stocks already? McConnell hiding at his Country Club you people simply refuse to call these punks out. This poor police officer is dead thanks to all of these worthless pukes on both sides. Money!!!

3852 2018-12-29 02:27:33 Wrong! Even in passive mgmt., a fund mgr has to buy (or sell) stocks or assets that mimic the performance of components of the index. As such if the index goes up because someone buys the contracts,the fund mgr has to increase the holdings so that the tracking error is minimized.

3859 2018-12-29 02:17:56 It grinds my gears when I run into someone with 2 stocks and 5 minutes or even *any* variation of 2 stocks online. It's like "why". 3 stocks is actually so much better in this game.
3860 2018-12-29 02:17:27 I just had a game (2 stocks) where I 0 to death'd the opponent then got them to around 100% their second stock before losing my first... and still managed to lose... How am I this bad?

Worst Dec stock performance since 1931. Stocks down for the year. And the last part of your tweet is laughable.

3869 2018-12-29 02:09:07 With the stock market correction, does it make sense for corporations to now buy back stocks? Can you calculate trade offs on buybacks, CAPX, dividends? In my Corporate Finance master class.

3873 2018-12-29 02:05:05 Gee Paul, everyone knows that the banking elite are at war with Trump and to make him look bad, all they have to do is raise interest rates and stocks will fall. They raised interest rates once on Obama and 8 times on Trump. What’s ur point?

3876 2018-12-29 02:00:36 Stocks are nervous due to a stupid Fed decision on rates and investors are terrified of the dumb-a-crats leading the house!

3879 2018-12-29 01:56:34 Expect any market bounces to be sold as stocks should go through another bottoming process with a retest. A 20% market decline in less than 3 months has most tactical and historical indicators suggesting extreme pain, notes Canaccord’s Tony Dwyer.
3880 2018-12-29 01:56:14 his stocks looking a lil slow rn
3881 2018-12-29 01:55:13 Tfw you’re just riding the high from a brand new menstrual cup and invest all ur money in stocks 
3882 2018-12-29 01:54:49 Gold miners bull market start latest by Feb end or March 2019 IMO, actively buying stocks all the time .
Happy many of the so called  advisors are still fearing to venture in to gold stocks, as always at the start of gold bull markets.
3883 2018-12-29 01:54:37 You want to make a change? Change the tax laws!!!!! If you put money in a bank, not stocks, not funds, a bank, you get an income deduction equal to that amount!!!! No taxes until you take it out...none, never!
3884 2018-12-29 01:53:58 alright y'all with 5 min 3 stocks need to get out, same with 6 min 2 stocks we moved on.
3885 2018-12-29 01:53:34 Trade accounts only count goods shipped across borders. A trade deficit is the dollars used to buy goods (investments) for use inside the US, and financial investments in US stocks and bonds. A trade deficit is fgns investing more in the US than the US in fgn countries.
3886 2018-12-29 01:53:34 Stayed totally away from Oil stocks over last many months, could see what was coming
However WTIC should hit USD 63 -65 over Feb 19 , so  Oil stocks should do well over next few months
3887 2018-12-29 01:52:46 Allowing U stocks to find their lowest level over 2019 and not touching any of them right now , but I check the charts of many U stocks every day, just in case

3890 2018-12-29 01:51:45 Hahaha yeah i have a full time job somewhere else so it’s alright but I’ll miss the little extra I got on the side. RIP my stocks
3891 2018-12-29 01:51:38 Year end promo! 
2 skirts for P450 only! 
Only for onhand stocks (see photos). Until Jan.15,2019 only.
3892 2018-12-29 01:51:35 Nasty bit of work, and yes it's clearly a considered, deliberate incitement. Stocks. I'd put him in the stocks.
3893 2018-12-29 01:51:29 Why do you hate preferreds - stocks may do less than 6% and you can buy a ton of fixed to float notes with 6-7% ytc's. You can buy GE preverred as GE bet at 76.
3894 2018-12-29 01:51:20 My stocks are down anywhere from 2% to fucking 28% #gopeconomy #fucktrump #trumpresign #mytaxdollars #gone #wallstreet
3895 2018-12-29 01:51:19 I wonder if @JulianWhigham knows any good stocks I should invest in...
3896 2018-12-29 01:50:39 mag couper doll kana lang kay cheol mas cute yun huhu and meron pa nagpapa ph go ng sg kase diba binoycott nung iba yung sg kaya ayun may stocks pa siguro
3897 2018-12-29 01:49:50 Steve Sjuggerud Stan Research yday take :

I realize nobody is talking about gold or gold stocks today. But that's what you want...

In order to buy an asset at the best price, you want to buy it when it's hated and ignored. And you want to sell it when it's all over the news.

3900 2018-12-29 01:47:53 Steve Sjuggerud is one of the smartest guys in advisory business, he sold all his gold stocks in July 2016 and then talked of a major draw down in gold and silver stocks over extended period of time.

He always gets his entries and exits right, he is now buying gold stocks.
3901 2018-12-29 01:47:14 Let's see what happens to my stocks in twenty years
3902 2018-12-29 01:47:03 I think if double stocks gone, double quickdraw and double grip should've gone too imo
3903 2018-12-29 01:46:51 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
3904 2018-12-29 01:46:34 I think not much. And probably mostly to buy other stocks or investments. Walmart pays dividends, that's their income stream.
3905 2018-12-29 01:46:33 I bought all my stocks with 20 years time horizon
3906 2018-12-29 01:45:02 I wonder whether you are just replying for the sake of replying, or whether you really watch the stock markets. You say you care for your children's future, yet you don't seem to care that the antics of the current govt has depressed both the RM and stocks.
3907 2018-12-29 01:44:55 Steve Sjuggerud Stan Research yday take :

This week, for the first time in years – and for only the second time in my long career – I'm personally buying gold stocks again. And I'm also doubling the amount of the physical gold I own.
3908 2018-12-29 01:44:30 1) Yeah, that's fair enough, but I also think many have really just not considered it. That's who my thread is targeting.

2) Not gonna comment on stocks/bonds/wtv. :P I have no expertise in that, and it could be very irresponsible to do so on Twitter ahahha.
3909 2018-12-29 01:44:25 Howard, you are in my backyard, follow these stocks indicated as well as 140 others with special advantages. Three things in this world, Software, semis and energy which is becoming free via solar. Everything else gets eaten by software.
3910 2018-12-29 01:43:43 Disc : For followers and friends :ya all may not believe, but I hold only gold stocks , platinum stocks and silver stocks ( miners & explorers ) 95 % of my PF ( rest is a few Cu and U plays )
Zero exposure anywhere else. 

If my stock picking is right ,should do >2.5X over 2019
3911 2018-12-29 01:43:43 Hope you had a good day that's a nice book TV commercial you and your brother invest returns with stocks hope you both had a good day
3912 2018-12-29 01:43:30 $SPY - obviously options.. If stock price is below $100 then I prefer shares... 

I trade options only on limited names.. FAANG stocks & ETFs
3913 2018-12-29 01:43:00 Are your conservative policies responsible for the mass murderers who happen to be white Americans with easy access to guns and bump stocks?
3914 2018-12-29 01:41:42 1v1 battlefield no items 3 stocks 
3915 2018-12-29 01:41:42 When are you and the republicans who are beholden to the NRA going to care more about innocent Americans than AK-47’s and bump stocks?
3916 2018-12-29 01:41:23 Regarde les benchs mec, c'est souvent plus que ça, après ça dépend des jeux
Et surtout regarde le prix de la 1080 maintenant, il n'y a presque plus aucuns stocks et sinon elle est au même prix que la 2070 voire plus chère
Et puis le raytracing, blablabla ;)
3917 2018-12-29 01:41:01 There are no certainties outside of the current squad who guarantee greater success. You can make a change for changes sake, but I don’t there’s a Stuart Law or Brad Hodge in the wings. Batting stocks nationwide just aren’t greatly equipped at the moment. Burns for Finch maybe
3918 2018-12-29 01:40:31 Pelosi was about to be busted for insider trading on Visa stocks...Obama got her off.. Hillary's son in law was setting up hedge funds in various countries that she told  him she would give billions in aid... your party is full of rich crooks..
3919 2018-12-29 01:39:08 Pray for a man like @kanyewest because he gives @KimKardashian the most thoughtful gifts like stocks, percentage to his yeezy company, and now gave her real estate for Christmas 
3920 2018-12-29 01:38:33 I get it.  But I think we should discuss potential new rules.

I am a small potatoe in the scheme of things. But there are some stocks in my 401k.

If I run for office - at what point should I be disqualified or forced to divest?
3921 2018-12-29 01:37:24 Steve Sjuggerud Stansberry Research yday remarks :

I expect today's extreme in COT Report means that we are close to the start of the next great bull market in gold and gold stocks
3922 2018-12-29 01:37:17 Some stocks are more buy than others, for some somewhere, sometime, maybe. 

However USS is not in recession mode despite of trade war.

Wars are ending, bringing cost savings, balance, but maybe pushing growth down, earnings may fall too.

USA may experience fast growth in 2019.
3923 2018-12-29 01:37:14 it's pretty impressive than the market endured a drawdown of 20% in the course of 10 weeks and we didn't hear about any blowups. the financial plumbing of the global financial system is very sound. things really do seem well underwritten (and underpriced). $SPY $IWM #stocks
3924 2018-12-29 01:37:01 Any member of Congress having stocks is disturbing to me. They are passing Bill's that directly effects their pockets. We needed you in Tina's seat. YOU understand this all too well.
3925 2018-12-29 01:36:09 Either gonna start messin wit real estate or stocks cause these lil jobs ain’t worth it
3926 2018-12-29 01:35:48 @Ocasio2018 please investigate whether trump and company is shorting stocks ahead of his crazy erratic announcements that cause the market to tank. Never forget money is his first and only love
3927 2018-12-29 01:34:09 Good time to buy stocks in Top Ramen!
3928 2018-12-29 01:34:08 Have max respect for Steve Sjuggerud Stan Research ,yday take:

I can tell you that the setup today in gold is the same as what we saw in late 2001. Gold stocks could make investors a few times their money.For only the second time in my long career ,I'm buying gold stocks again.
3929 2018-12-29 01:33:58 Once you’ve signed up feel free to reach out to me for more tips on investing on stocks! 
3930 2018-12-29 01:33:17 Bingo... you think anyone wants to hold stocks into earnings after Q3 lol
3931 2018-12-29 01:32:36 Gonna take a lot more than 10% or 20% drop in stocks.

That said, I've believed it will happen since the day I saw Andrew Jackson hanging on the wall.

Gotta get ugly first though... Really, really ugly.

So very worth it to secure a second Independence Day.
3932 2018-12-29 01:32:21 We should buy stocks where we have high conviction. Conviction on rejected stocks is more as we know with more clarity what is bad than what is good. What we buy, we track closely. If the conviction was high, one would tend not to do that!

3933 2018-12-29 01:31:08 gun people: man I cannot believe they banned bump stocks, trump betrayed us, the government is bees, the earth is flat-

me, also a gun person, but not a fucking idiot: shut up
3934 2018-12-29 01:29:08 Real niggas invest in stocks 
3935 2018-12-29 01:28:14 Absolutely. It’s really good to have more people being meticulous about their spending so that they know how much money they have that is sitting idly. And if they put those into FDs, it’s quite helpful. And those who would fancy some risk can always try stocks lol.....
3936 2018-12-29 01:27:12 Been in the market since 80s  been through a couple of these throw up times. Actually I have done what she suggested. I do not recommend doing it for a 401k. I have done this for my long term stocks. I’m glad I did I’m sure it does not work for everyone
3937 2018-12-29 01:25:14 We banned four lokos before AR-15s and bump stocks...
3938 2018-12-29 01:24:32 When someone mentioned he made 1M or 3M profit last year, I wrote down the dates, the codes and stocks he bought and then looked at the charts

3942 2018-12-29 01:22:03 Do you own any stocks Jim ? Or maybe you were privileged enough to invest in companies before they went public?
3943 2018-12-29 01:19:05 2/2
…stocks, bonds, metals, art, seeking gtr returns.
The massive financialization of our economy has harmed, not helped, Main St.
Last, banks have, since the ’08 crash, been v averse to lending to all but the v best risks.
So even if they have more $, it’s not benefiting most.
3944 2018-12-29 01:18:20 It is reality. I wish it were not so, but it is what it is. There are insufficient social housing stocks even to meet priority needs.
3945 2018-12-29 01:18:05 Keep in mind that he's from the same group of people that are happy with armed teachers in schools and bump stocks being sold rather than have sensible gun legislation for our own citizens.
3946 2018-12-29 01:17:01 Scandinavia countries govts bought stocks. Has NIRP. Same with Japan. Hasn't been tried in the US yet. Could happen, no?
3947 2018-12-29 01:14:41 It`s been going on for hundreds of years, maybe more. The whole world is affected! Nobody ows you anything -.-
3948 2018-12-29 01:14:37 @somsnit I have a question on it, what are the differences in trading currencies and the stocks that follow currencies such as $ULE or $UUP
3949 2018-12-29 01:14:22 STRIKER OUTFIT stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
3950 2018-12-29 01:13:59 Could not disagree more with this. All Aus batting stocks are top order batsman
3951 2018-12-29 01:13:53 That would be smart. Sell your stocks.
3952 2018-12-29 01:13:41 Ending 2018 with $1,000 worth of stocks! 

My goal for 2019 is to have $5,000 worth of stocks and then start seriously building in 2020!! I’m so confident this is a start of something great.
3953 2018-12-29 01:13:11 He should be getting the stocks
3954 2018-12-29 01:12:14 Do you guys still hate bump stocks?
3955 2018-12-29 01:11:49 Gary Anderson 2019, Wall Street investors are turning to safe-haven stocks in industries like utilities and consumer staples.…
3956 2018-12-29 01:11:19 As soon as that check come flipping some stocks 
3957 2018-12-29 01:11:19 For the same reason I didnt say anything when stocks fell so drastically.  Because it's not important. Hate to break it to you but the president has nothing to do with either up or down

3960 2018-12-29 01:05:02 At this point, it is almost a 90% probability we are going into a recession at the end of 2019 unless we get a miracle.  Stocks performance are always a 6 months indicator before a recession start and 6 months before we get out of the recession as well.
3961 2018-12-29 01:05:02 Another top google search was “how to short stocks”.... great sign of a bottom. #Stocks buy buy buy
3962 2018-12-29 01:04:39 Buying stocks under the 20 day sma .....
3963 2018-12-29 01:01:43 I wish you still made the stocks just like a AR fixed stock
3964 2018-12-29 01:01:39 Wishing financial blessings upon everyone , 2019 is the year of money. Start your business. Invest in YOURSELF. (& some stocks). Travel. Live your best life cause the only thing stopping you is YOU. 
3965 2018-12-29 01:00:50 The three big powers of the US, Russia and China should fire sustained ordnance into the terrorist homeland until there combined ammo is exhausted. Then they should replenish their stocks and do it all over again.
3966 2018-12-29 00:58:27 Stocks should split and bring in some market liquidity, take these vol swings down a notch
3967 2018-12-29 00:58:10 Because the people who like crypto aint gonnna go away. Same as stock people. Stocks are a hundred year bubble but no one complians cnbc and bloomber still chatter for 24 hours a day on them in bear or bull markets. There is no crypto tv channel
3968 2018-12-29 00:57:55 Talking about Pensions buying stocks when it was truly the #PPT.
3969 2018-12-29 00:57:38 You do realize that buying back their own stocks is considered an investment right? They are not investing in workers, we need to stop this supply side economics (top down) and get back to bottom up
3970 2018-12-29 00:57:37 So what did you buy on xmas eve? Any individual stocks ?
3971 2018-12-29 00:57:08 Need multiple tab of certain pages like “ option chain’ for different stocks . currently not possible . Support never responds
3972 2018-12-29 00:52:45 Think trump was on a blacked out plane flying ABROAD (while well insulated/protected on AF1) to visit the troops on a “surprise” visit is all coincidence? Time to sit back and enjoy the show buddy! I know it’s hard but trust the plan.
3973 2018-12-29 00:50:35 You didn’t pay much attention Christmas morning did you. You haven’t HEARD about the arrests because you won’t hear about them until AFTER the 10 days of darkness. Arrests took place in early morning hours Christmas day

3976 2018-12-29 00:45:13 I’ve played w/calcs on feed value of expected rice stocks few yrs ago....now this?? Fun times!!
3977 2018-12-29 00:44:49 And you get paid millions of dollars in compensation. Honestly, for $1million, I'd stand in stocks on Sparks Street for 24 hours in my undies while strangers take my pic, insult me, and throw tomatoes.
3978 2018-12-29 00:44:49 Also have $OKTA on my list. I don’t know about $MDB and $MELI - will look at those ones. Valuation is generally better now than a few months ago. Most stocks on my list are 30 to 40% off their top
3979 2018-12-29 00:44:21 ASCENDANT FACTION stocks rallying
3980 2018-12-29 00:43:28 To everyone who has money in the stock market that they cannot afford to lose; please consider putting a portion of your investment into physical gold and silver. Those controlling the markets intend to crash stocks at some point, especially if it can make Trump look bad.
3981 2018-12-29 00:41:07 You could do worse than covering it now rather than squeezing the last couple pennies out of it...once stocks are functionally “dead” they act like a cornered animal, you don’t know what direction they’ll head in based on whatever BS tweet pops up...
3982 2018-12-29 00:40:31 Not true. Divestment is pretty easy, and returns are comparable to non-divested funds. It would just take a call or two to one's financial advisor to divest.

3984 2018-12-29 00:39:12 The benefit of trading contracts is that it forces you to dump. The downside is the temptation of over leveraging trades. Controlling your Wojak is key.

Trading stocks and coins puts you in a hodl or partial hodl mindset. Also you can only go long... Missing half the traffic.
3985 2018-12-29 00:37:37 I don’t use to buy and hold all the position if it’s going hard way down . Just check how many times I have sold $FNKO since first time I bought it at 27$ ( more or less ) . Buy and hold strategy it’s ok in uptrends but like 99% of the stocks now $FNKO is no different.
3986 2018-12-29 00:37:33 I imagine he looked like he had a stroke last week when the stocks bombed.....
3987 2018-12-29 00:37:32 It was a long time before I got the hang of stocks. I would love to play a part in irony, spite, evolution, and recreating myself. To legally financially backing a company with everything I have. I would love to own a stock market somewhair. I'll be looking at bitcoin till then
3988 2018-12-29 00:37:04 can yall believe we played w only 2 stocks in smash 4
3989 2018-12-29 00:36:39 New rule: Any time I find anyone with any 2 stock rules I'm going to block you right after our game. 2 stocks 3 minutes? lol nah get out
3990 2018-12-29 00:35:31 GGB is doing well for me. Sold a bunch (of other stocks)to take some tax losses. Down about 30% on the year. High hopes for the new year. Things are looking pretty stable with trump at the helm 
3991 2018-12-29 00:31:27 Jim, i’m going to have to agree with you on this one. I am a former action alerts member and I distinctly recall you frequently selling 25 to 50% of the fang stocks when they’ve run too far and the technicals don’t support there overbought position.
3992 2018-12-29 00:30:38 It's true. But you don't have to write "borrowed". That's the way SS works. The money is put in US Treasury Bonds. The US govt uses that money, then pays it back as the Bonds become due.
I mean what else would you do with the money? Stocks? Banks? God forbid!
3993 2018-12-29 00:30:15 So is the President.  And Mnuchin from a Mexican beach as he plunges stocks 1000 points.
3994 2018-12-29 00:30:00 Stocks were mostly lower in late trade Friday after moving between modest gains and losses over the course of the session, as investors prepared to cap a holiday-shortened week marked by wild swings that has the S&P 500 on track for its first weekly gain of December - Bloomberg
3995 2018-12-29 00:29:49 This is Smash Ultimate, not Smash 4. Please stop choosing 2 stocks, its not cool and you need to let that shit go.
3996 2018-12-29 00:26:59 went to my friend’s dad’s office on Wallstreet where they trade stocks and ‘twas v interesting. I’m basically a business woman
3997 2018-12-29 00:25:05 Will she divest of her stocks?
3998 2018-12-29 00:24:00 US economy and competitiveness is providing real wage and economic growth for the first time in 10 years so investors have real investment alternatives to the stock market! Many tech stocks were overvalued. Value drop needed for Facebook, Apple, Google & most of Silicon Valley!
3999 2018-12-29 00:23:58 @option_snipper Appreciate all you do. Locked in profits today and thankfully was sidelined before the tech stocks fell. Always progressively lock in gains like you always say.
4000 2018-12-29 00:22:22 Oh Betty Betty Betty, hemp is now legal.  Which means, biodegradable plastics, clean fuel, less water and pesticides will be needed.  Looks like you will need to change stocks.
4001 2018-12-29 00:21:46 @jonnajarian Did you mention on @HalftimeReport the other day that we can sell stocks as late as Dec 31 for 2018 tax loss purposes?  Is that new this year?  I thought it had to settle and we'd have to sell a few business days before Jan 1...
4002 2018-12-29 00:19:54 solid!
4003 2018-12-29 00:19:21 congrats!
4004 2018-12-29 00:19:10 Why Now Could be the Time to Look at Preferred Stocks
4005 2018-12-29 00:18:54 Unemployment is at an all time low, stocks have been awesome, more money on our checks, Americans are working again, our military is stronger than ever and growing, and above all he has American first.
4006 2018-12-29 00:18:50 Did he divest all defense stocks?
4007 2018-12-29 00:16:44 If we could taunt...

Also when the tech for this game explodes people will just drill their movement between stocks anyways.
4008 2018-12-29 00:16:38 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
4009 2018-12-29 00:16:11 Yup, we're all just collateral damage to our Betters's & their self fulfillment, power, & money.
4010 2018-12-29 00:15:53 They will tell any lie.  He has stocks of those ugly hats on board Air Force One.
4011 2018-12-29 00:15:49 @RichLowry you have a cock eyed view of the economy...stocks are being triggered by fed interest rate jumps... not wages.. wages are stagnant thanks to low end products coming rom abroad ... China, Japan.mexico are all taking jobs from US... we suckle the worlds economy!!!
4012 2018-12-29 00:15:22 Stocks are def in the gutter, this the best time to invest
4013 2018-12-29 00:14:28 Winning! Unless you own stocks. Or work for an auto company or Carrier. Or the federal government. Or like to drink water or breathe air.
4014 2018-12-29 00:12:11 Not my fault you like to be the ”puppy” to the elite of the world. If you don’t like crypto. Go back to your stocks.
4015 2018-12-29 00:12:01 Got fire $575 millions. Stocks still up high. Ha ha ha let do 1 billion then stocks jumping double prices . Hooray my calculations perfect
4016 2018-12-29 00:10:38 I built a list of Leader stocks (largely borrowed from other smart folks) and even dipped toe into some small positions...but honestly there was no money made in growth today.   25 $FFTY down to 23 up

4020 2018-12-29 00:07:15 Oh my. It’s an unsung hero. Many, many stocks - have you had a great chicken stock? - it had parsley. Salsa verde. It’s in there. Classic French herbs for a salad - parley is one of the four (the others: tarragon, chives & chervil).
