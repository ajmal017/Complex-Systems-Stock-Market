7 2018-11-12 23:59:06 Uh, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said Sunday that the kingdom will reduce exports by about 500,000 barrels a day from November to December. Khalid al-Falih made the comment at a meeting of oil producers in Abu Dhabi.

12 2018-11-12 23:58:14 Thanks! Just needed some olive oil and detergent, and to return some wrong-colored bathmats I ordered from Macy’s online. Got a LOT more than I bargained for!

46 2018-11-12 23:56:35 Saudi Arabia cuts up people, not oil production or prices.
47 2018-11-12 23:56:28 This is sad refineries will be CLOSING, layoffs in oil drilling, and sales of new equipment will stand still. Oil has to be at a decent price to pay workers in this industry also.

51 2018-11-12 23:56:03 Yes I stand by @hairfinity products 100% the results are real! Check them out also try adding deep conditioning treatments to your weekly regimen (coconut oil, avocado oil, peppermint oil, *any leave in conditioner or hair mask*) and sit under the hooded dryer for 30-1 hour
52 2018-11-12 23:56:01 Wow this Goldman Sachs ad they keep sticking on twitter combines the two things I love most in life, banks and big oil. WTF!? Great ad targeting twitter.
53 2018-11-12 23:55:59 見して。。。？
54 2018-11-12 23:55:57 Definitely true. And a lot of people don't like her just because she's a woman. But a lot of people want to save the future of our species and reasonably don't believe a candidate who's taken big oil money for decades is going to divest from fossil fuels.
55 2018-11-12 23:55:57 trump does everything he can to increase consumption of oil and coal, so global warming can be really strong, so he can have wildfires in California and hurricans in Puerto Rico, places where there are many Democrats...
56 2018-11-12 23:55:51 So if this is true, then Notley and the NDP are anti oil?   We can’t trust them to promote Alberta oil industry as they have historically been against it?

Then they go full retard on someone that drinks milk because of environmental damage caused by ag industry while palm oil destroys thousands of hectares of forest

68 2018-11-12 23:54:52 Thanks for this. But I think Unilever should be looking at alternatives alongside palm oil production, whilst continuing sustainability goals. 4.5m people dependant on industry does not justify deforestation. I shall try to buy products without palm oil from now on.
69 2018-11-12 23:54:38 Just wait till the first oil slick decimates the seal colonies on the south coast of KI! He will point fingers at everyone but himself!
70 2018-11-12 23:54:35 What so you’re rich oil buddies can raise the gas pump prices and make even more profit from the America taxpayers, cheaper oil should mean cheaper gasoline but not in trump’s world, trump’s world is bigger profits & pass the cost on to the cost of living
71 2018-11-12 23:54:31 I work in electrical.
72 2018-11-12 23:54:21 Meaning = I’ve made a personal deal with Saudi Arabia and OPEC to cut oil production. Oil prices will be much higher and the Saudis will make a much higher profit on supply and give me a cut of the money. Also this will upset the market and I will blame it on the democrats.

74 2018-11-12 23:54:18 I bought a Marula oil from Whole Foods I read there is nothing special about d.e? But I just read some reviews and I’m def gonna try them out.
75 2018-11-12 23:54:14 No need for your oil than ! At least we agree on something! I guess contrary to you, I’m not a radical. My car runs on 100% renewable energy. No oil. You might need our transfer payments some day.
76 2018-11-12 23:54:14 Tell me why the disabled in the support grp of ESA are included in this travesty if it’s to make work pay and why the disabled don’t get the same help and why ppl who have a change in circumstances don’t get help you shady snake oil purveyor of shite
77 2018-11-12 23:54:10 @Tesco does the palm oil contained in your gluten free brownies come from a sustainable source?
78 2018-11-12 23:54:04 You are hopeless and must be living in the 70's. The largest US export is oil.  We don't need their oil.  If you are so into the health of our country and lower oil costs, stop letting large corporations export our own natural resource and capping existing wells to control price!
79 2018-11-12 23:54:03 Can’t help noticing that our trade deficits have gotten much WORSE since you’ve been in office. Also, #NorthKorea is still building nukes, oil prices are rising, national debt is rising faster, #stockmarket is weaker, #coal is not coming back, and soybean #farmers are suffering.
80 2018-11-12 23:54:01 Think oil producers' actions have anything to do with supply?

82 2018-11-12 23:53:36 Unless you are ignoring everything except the Trump BS ,global oil stockpiles are at an all-time high. There's a current overstock of oil. But as you see Republicans are profiting by extreme overpricing  & false cost estimates. Costs based on refinery expenses is just a lie.

88 2018-11-12 23:52:33 Most of the US shale/fracking drillers are losing money. Tens of billions annually. Only capital investment is sustaining them. EU money has pulled out. The US oil boom has an end date.
89 2018-11-12 23:52:30 Yes! Plis try them. I bought them when I bought those Drunk Elephant products. And out of all those- I’m most impressed with the Gross pads...although I’m thinking about buying the Marula oil from D.E

95 2018-11-12 23:51:50 Plus our enemys like qatar and turkey hate him because they know what he wants us to be as a great nation independint on oil and belive in peace as they dont , so its kinda a thing we do to show support.
96 2018-11-12 23:51:42 No worse than the soldiers that have for the past 2 decades been sent to die in the middle east over a holy war that basically boils down to oil and dirt. I have family that would love to just be back on USA soil, hopefully they build a wall while they are down there.
97 2018-11-12 23:51:41 what’s the make and model? most emission control engine problems are very minor can be fixed at an oil change
98 2018-11-12 23:51:36 @realDonaldTrump quit trying to cut the price of oil. Do you know how many jobs will be lost?
99 2018-11-12 23:51:30 Just wondering how do we stop deforestation for palm oil? Other vegetable oils grow less productively so we’d just shift the problem somewhere else and make it larger? Cutting down on shampooing and pizza guzzling seems a bit harsh?
100 2018-11-12 23:51:30 What has palm oil got to do with veganism? Palm oil is terrible, but isn’t even remotely close to being a vegan-only product? Maybe don’t conflate the two...
101 2018-11-12 23:51:22 The last two times I’ve come to get my oil changed, men have complained about the price and said “I can do it myself” OKAY CHAD LEAVE AND STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SERVICE YOU CAME HERE FOR.

107 2018-11-12 23:50:42 @DNC @GOP @WhiteHouse 1) IMO Pelosi voting against Iraq War WMD Lies deserves credit like Nadler,etc. but Hoyer voted for Iraq War WMD Lies like Schiff, Engel,Lowey,Deutsch, Green, Pascrell,etc.,IMO they knew Evidence was a scam: Terrorist were in Afghanistan, Iraq was about Oil
108 2018-11-12 23:50:41 You place oil sanctions on Iran and than comment that oil prices should be much lower . Think about it 

Anyway, SA already announced that they were cutting- want the price to go down- lift the Iran sanctions.

119 2018-11-12 23:49:49  Nope, Slow counting, old machines, & inefficiencies maybe, but absolutely NO EVIDENCE of any fraud. But you would say anything to distract from your house losses, rising #oil prices, #NorthKorea nuclear proliferation, #stockmarket weakness, & rising #debt.

124 2018-11-12 23:49:18 I also wonder if the choice to stop importing Saudi oil to the Irving refinery in Saint John NB will be on the table? They employ roughly 3000 in eastern Can & N.Eng. We have lots in Alberta we can’t move. Be nice to refine our own product. It’s like importing snow....pointless.
125 2018-11-12 23:49:17 oh!イル
126 2018-11-12 23:48:51 Can't start small (I.e. regionally) to create an energy company. All businesses start with an idea & grow with the market & revenue level.
Starting a solar farm could easily create low cost regional energy. Alberta actually looked into it, but had their tantrum over oil instead.

132 2018-11-12 23:47:39 This is a tweet free of political sentiment. It's the best I've seen in a while, says a lot about our poor country which some folks felt we're rich cos we got oil. Everyone has to contribute to this nation if we're to get it right.

135 2018-11-12 23:47:18 Tip: Do your car windows fog up when it gets cold outside? Put some charcoal, kitty litter, or oil dry inside of socks underneath your seat and that should help.

143 2018-11-12 23:46:50 ok no offense but there are brands out here charging $48 dollars for an ounce of something that supposedly has CBD oil in it but they don't even list the mgs of CBD oil anywhere?? 

save your money people! don't be fooled by minimalist design and paid magazine reviews 
144 2018-11-12 23:46:46 I could use that oil you know...got a pretty expensive fleet
145 2018-11-12 23:46:46 Golden Key returns tomorrow with more wild and cool stories about hong kong intrigue and the women and god the women and jesus christ the women and there as one black student put it: I didn't think and yet the fisticuffs sandwich that the three oil company students got involved
146 2018-11-12 23:46:41 We need to reduce oil use so we could easily exceed demand. We should use oil for plastic and planes and not much else
147 2018-11-12 23:46:33 They certainly do not see THESE people as equals........

We SO need a replacement for oil.......................
148 2018-11-12 23:46:29 Tonight's dinner...

150 2018-11-12 23:46:09 We have them at home. My son set the grill on fire when he was a toddler and the cooker had knobs on the front (at toddler height ) Having worked for @Total Oil I went for fire training. Always had extinguishers since. It saved our kitchen if not the cooker!
151 2018-11-12 23:46:08 ぶたさんかわいい！
152 2018-11-12 23:46:04 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
153 2018-11-12 23:46:04 Try the free trial! One of the base ingredients is sweet almond oil so it's a little moisturizing. I only break out during that time of months now or when I'm super stressed
154 2018-11-12 23:45:57 When the World cease buying our crude oil, I wonder what will be of us.
155 2018-11-12 23:45:51 No because they have taken it further and removed any products that have palm oil or traces within their ingredients!!
156 2018-11-12 23:45:45 食パンさんおは未来ちゃです！！
157 2018-11-12 23:45:44 I refuse to listen to Christmas music until December 1st, but there’s peppermint oil in the diffuser and I’ve had gingerbread twice so far this month. You gotta know where to draw the line.
158 2018-11-12 23:45:26 If you think anyone of either party can win there without being friendly to the oil industry, I want some of what you're smoking.
159 2018-11-12 23:45:23 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they orgasm
160 2018-11-12 23:45:22 If you pushed alternative energy sources, like solar and wind, it wouldn't matter what OPEC did. Only Republican greed and stupidity keeps the US dependent on foreign oil.
161 2018-11-12 23:45:19 So let me get this straight. You want to cut Iran out of the oil loop, but you want production to go UP?? Rex was SPOT ON with the word MORON!!
162 2018-11-12 23:45:07 Wall will go to the clippers n have a wizards sequel before he teamup with bron...the idea seems like oil n water
163 2018-11-12 23:45:01 Iceland, frozen food company, rebranded a greenpeace film about palm oil in foods. Clearcast, a legal consultancy firm, said it would break the law. Iceland declared that it was now banned. it's rage marketing.
164 2018-11-12 23:45:00 Sexual misconduct at the age of 95...
I have some snake oil to sell you
165 2018-11-12 23:44:52 @nprscottsimon so The Donald has catalyzed the two greatest JVs of all time....Russia & Saudi Arabia....and Iran & China....Go Big Oil !!....
166 2018-11-12 23:44:47 
167 2018-11-12 23:44:39 Oil prices should only be the concern of industrial buyers, not the general public, that is, in an advanced society that commutes via alternative/renewable energy vehicles. Gas is inefficient and outdated. Anyone that thinks we need to drill, or worry about OPEC, is ignorant.
168 2018-11-12 23:44:32 me on a first date: capitalism is deadly, race is a social construct, and coconut oil is not meant to be put on your face
169 2018-11-12 23:44:27 Popeye banged Olive Oil
170 2018-11-12 23:44:14 This oil gonna have me flying lol
171 2018-11-12 23:44:10 What does this have to do with election fraud? Besides, it's pure B.S.!
By the way, oil prices are falling.
172 2018-11-12 23:43:59 America's "heritage"? Does he mean how foreigners took over America and claimed it as their own, forcing indigenous communities into designated protected lands that are being polluted by Big Oil and farming? Or about how immigrants made the US what it is today?

174 2018-11-12 23:43:40 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
175 2018-11-12 23:43:28 oh what you going to do badass go take the oil from them?!
176 2018-11-12 23:43:23 Data is like oil. It’s valuable, it needs to be refined to draw out its true value, and the growing efforts to commercialise so much of it is having a deleterious effect on society.
177 2018-11-12 23:43:19 Get that oil trump.
178 2018-11-12 23:43:14 but will you stop buying products with palm oil?? 
179 2018-11-12 23:43:11 My skin is combi-sensitive kdg2 dry.

181 2018-11-12 23:42:50 Key word is “Should”

Prices won’t be lower cause they only care about profit!

That’s why the USA needs to be the world leader in oil production!

186 2018-11-12 23:42:16 Julia, what's new? I think the Saudis will produce less and less oil in the future.
187 2018-11-12 23:42:12 I wouldn't she accepts big money from the oil lobby. Her loss sets dems up for a better candidate
188 2018-11-12 23:42:08 Our military is the size it is to protect the elite energies that run our economy.  Oil and uranium.
189 2018-11-12 23:42:04 motor oil so i can motorboat thos pecs
190 2018-11-12 23:42:01 I used tea tree oil on my nose and it was a godsend. I might try it again because I am hurting 
191 2018-11-12 23:42:01 still the crowd harangued the author and this could have been used for orphan drugs and Zapata Oil knew about and Theodore Cruz knew and kept it hidden from Perez and Company and still it was not a conspiracy it was a book:  golden key nailed you and still the dais emptied soon
192 2018-11-12 23:41:56 Have you read my write up on Trump and oil?
193 2018-11-12 23:41:56 Yeah, words are cheap. When are your establishment Democrats going to stop taking big oil donations? NEVER.
#DNCisTheDeadParty
194 2018-11-12 23:41:55 Doug Ford passed a carbon tax in Ontario.

Alberta and BC doing best in the country, have carbon taxes.

Billions go to the oil companies yearly, we'd be better off just giving that money to us instead and it'd more then offset the carbon tax.
195 2018-11-12 23:41:52 Coconut oil will work?#BeginARelationshipIn4Words
196 2018-11-12 23:41:41 If they have something to say that is genuinely worth listening to, why are all the conservative media guys universally tabling it in favor of a grift feeding a steady stream of disinformation to the same people to whom they’re shilling snake oil brain pills?
197 2018-11-12 23:41:27 Bought my first jar of coconut oil today. I want to pour dark chocolate and almonds on it and go to town lol
198 2018-11-12 23:41:24 Olive oil > coconut oil

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
199 2018-11-12 23:41:09 She is trying to convince Albertans her position on Alberta oil has changed but the one pipeline she supports is jaded w/ delays etc, It might never get built, it's almost as if Karma doesn't believe in change either.

202 2018-11-12 23:41:03 when I was 13 I was offered to chase heroin by a guy I bought cannabis from & was told it was cannabis oil .. need I say any more!!! people like you are the reason people are dying from drug use .. get a grip!
203 2018-11-12 23:41:01 Sadly, my skin is sensitive...nothing unnatural seems to help it...the last stuff that did help was the St Ives Apricot scrub but, the last time I tried it...it made my face super dry and hurt...I am going to put rose oil on my face...
204 2018-11-12 23:41:00 No kidding. Dicing up U.S. residents is one thing, but cutting oil production is TOO FAR, DAMNIT!

207 2018-11-12 23:40:48 Iceland's orangutan ad is fine, but:
1- UK bans ads “directed towards a political end”
2- This is a Greenpeace video. Iceland just added they stop palm oil.
I guess the ban was expected (NGO vid = political end), and it is a ploy for a buzz.

209 2018-11-12 23:40:40 Breaking: Eland Oil & Gas $LON:ELA "Buy" Rating Reconfirmed at Canaccord Genuity Today; The Target Price is GBX 165.00 ...
210 2018-11-12 23:40:39 California would get its (not it's) power from wind, sun, hydro, tide power, and the oil that it could buy from other countries.
211 2018-11-12 23:40:30 How do you reconcile all your flights, and resultant CO2 emissions, with your support for a ban on oil drilling? Where do you think jet fuel comes from and how do you think its source material is found? #inconvenienttruth #doasisaynotasido
212 2018-11-12 23:40:28 It was a #productive day! Got new breaks and rotors on my car. Had an oil change and inspection done on it. Had my wedding rings inspected. Went shopping for a HUGE grocery order and now we're all stocked up on food!
#productivity #busy #preparing
213 2018-11-12 23:40:27 I have to agree. A healthy balanced diet takes Time and $$. GNC makes excellent multivitamins. Please be careful to Not Take excess oil soluble vitamins = A, E, D
214 2018-11-12 23:40:22 Certainly not. What these “boneheads” can’t get through their heads, is if you focus on the people, you can accomplish A LOT. The oil tanked! But instead of simply focusing on this, get your team together and fix the things you can now!
215 2018-11-12 23:40:20 Talk about #FakeNews the stocks are bad because of the tech and oil markets.  Ask an economist before you fear monger. You will end up causing violence towards us Dems and then you will laugh.  You are the worst president ever.
216 2018-11-12 23:40:13 That’s my hugest fear(along with every other Oil fan I am sure)

Obviously Katz is not getting the message. I would rather something like McDavid saying something instead of the route of him leaving the 1 chance he gets. 

Just can’t believe we are in year 4 w/ him and this is it
217 2018-11-12 23:40:12 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
218 2018-11-12 23:40:10 Administrations can and do make decisions that increase/decrease oil production.
219 2018-11-12 23:40:09 If every Western country decided not to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, it will collapse and it won't money to build mosques to spread hatred against Christians and Jews.

Irony- We let them build mosques and appoint imams which in turn call us infidels and preach hatred of us.
220 2018-11-12 23:40:05 We don't need nearly the oil qty we used to.  Electric cars everywhere now.  Under $2 a gallon next year and I buy a SRT Grand Cherokee lol.  #sorrynotsorry
221 2018-11-12 23:40:03 Agree,  countries (specially China and Russia) will have to sell $GOLD. As it did happened with oil in 2015. Everything for  the $USD. However we would be close to WWIII. Candidates Russia & China.
222 2018-11-12 23:39:40 @kairyssdal so The Donald has catalyzed the two greatest JVs of all time....Russia & Saudi Arabia....and Iran & China....Go Big Oil !!....
223 2018-11-12 23:39:38 The chad vegetable oil vs the virgin olive oil.
224 2018-11-12 23:39:36 Yes. CBD oil definitely helps with my anxiety and I would take medical marijuana over sleeping medication any day.
225 2018-11-12 23:39:22 Remember! If you don't support Hillary Clinton running in 2020, it's because you're sexist and not because you're worried a candidate funded by big oil won't take action to stave off an imminent extinction of our species.
226 2018-11-12 23:38:59 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
227 2018-11-12 23:38:54 It didn't....if it did, it will do same for Nigeria.

Better put: Oil 'alone' didn't build Dubai
228 2018-11-12 23:38:35 He n ver invisted in oil and therefore, he looks at it from consumer point of view
229 2018-11-12 23:38:25 Dem base: "Fix climate change"
Neera: "we believe climate change is real"[cashing oil and gas checks].
230 2018-11-12 23:38:21 Lemon artichoke soup from Adair Kitchen. You also have Jennis Noodle House right behind your office building I believe, I like the chili oil ramen, and the infernal chicken curry (it's more like a soup than a proper British curry).
231 2018-11-12 23:38:19 Lol I don't know how to explain it. They said its oil bean seed though
232 2018-11-12 23:38:18 He's making a excuse for not sanctioning the Saudis over Kashoggi's murder. Cutting journalists up is ok so long as you don't cut the oil supply off.
233 2018-11-12 23:38:18 yes i want her oil
234 2018-11-12 23:38:16 Because Anti-Semitism is alive and well in America, and unlike what they would like you to think, most of it lives on the left.  Likely the vast majority.
235 2018-11-12 23:38:16 I smell like oil paints.
236 2018-11-12 23:38:08 She says the fishing was the jewel in the crown........I guess she isn’t familiar with all that oil in the North Sea.......
237 2018-11-12 23:38:05 Bad news must be coming re the economy and oil prices if you are trying to deflect blame away from what you have done to the economy.
238 2018-11-12 23:37:56 I need to gift some beard oil.. and need some recommendations
239 2018-11-12 23:37:37 coconut oil!
240 2018-11-12 23:37:33 Anyone whose been in markets long enough to exceed the avg VAR model look back might remember how Saudis cut oil production into $10 a barrel & essentially blew up their economy in name of OPEC while opec members made sure to supply what KSA did not
just ask @BillClinton
241 2018-11-12 23:37:32 You know they killed an American journalist right?   Oil is not the top priority loser
242 2018-11-12 23:37:19 この方、絵もうまいのに顔もよいとかすごいな
243 2018-11-12 23:37:15 I got some kick ass cough syrup, egg drop soup...but no oil. I will have to look into that. I freaking KNOW zicam works, I don't know why I didn't think of that.
244 2018-11-12 23:37:00 @ChickfilA you really should post an explanation in the restaurants of how refined peanut oil (which your chicken is fried in) is not an allergen like regular peanut oil. I thought We nearly fed our son something which could kill him. Something a little more obvious?
245 2018-11-12 23:36:49 Burn all the oil.
246 2018-11-12 23:36:47 Thanks. Tried the oil of oregano drops they were nasty but great benefits
247 2018-11-12 23:36:36 I do hope this includes research using CBD oil.
248 2018-11-12 23:36:22 capitalism has obfuscated the process of obtaining the delicious, miracle cure, Snaked Oil
249 2018-11-12 23:36:21 My mom has the same! Try CBD oil it’s supposed to help too bb
250 2018-11-12 23:36:17 And a federal government hell bent on killing everything that is even remotely connected to oil and gas
251 2018-11-12 23:36:17 WE don't need no Stinkin Saudi OIL.. hey did you talk to them about #Kashoggi
252 2018-11-12 23:36:10 So I put lavender oil in my steamer hopefully nothing bad happens lmao
253 2018-11-12 23:35:58 Might not be good for jobs in the oil field but its great for everyday people low prices at the pump in gas and home heating
254 2018-11-12 23:35:52 >falling for snake oil salesmen in 2018 when you can just wring the oil from the snakes directly into your mouth for free
255 2018-11-12 23:35:42 #CrookedDonald  trying to manipulate the oil market through Twitter.  What a tool.
256 2018-11-12 23:35:41 Yes. USA and Canada oil is flooding the market.
257 2018-11-12 23:35:24 When you are blinded by oil money, you are also displaced from reality.
258 2018-11-12 23:34:50 the thing abt human beings is we will never ever ever ever stop falling for snake oil salesmen
259 2018-11-12 23:34:50 So, I got Ferulic Acid 3%
Alpha Arbutin 2% +HA 
& the cold pressed rosehip oil.
I have dry skin, idk where I went wrong 
But something really swell up my face and caused me to break out
260 2018-11-12 23:34:42 I use tea tree oil twice a day and it seems to help.
261 2018-11-12 23:34:24 I was thinking I was going to eat chicken and waffles for dinner and I don't have no oil...smh
262 2018-11-12 23:34:19 Logic and #libtards = oil and water. A targeted hunt of antlerless white-tailed deer would cost nothing and yield better results.

#hunting #conservation #DeerHunting #AnnArbor
263 2018-11-12 23:34:09 Yes, but our oil companies are slowing down production to keep prices up on Fuel.
264 2018-11-12 23:33:49 *Articles.

*My father bought an HMT watch. The  watch is beautiful.
*She wants to become *a* doctor.
*It's on *no article* Arthur Road.
×We need *an* egg, *an* onion and *no article* oil to make *a* single omelette.
*The* Sinhgadh is in *the* East of Pune.
265 2018-11-12 23:33:48 I just block a man for trying to scam also 11 in one day all with the same dead wife who died of brain tumor and 14 yr daughter in private school , he is now after 3 yrs trying to move on, in AK now on oil rig , same story different men ... Sure they really need a better script.
266 2018-11-12 23:33:44 Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is laughing at Trump. They lure a US resident to their embassy in Turkey to murder him and grind him up into pieces...Trump does nothing. Once they realize Trump won’t do anything, they announce they are cutting oil production to drive up prices. Unreal.
267 2018-11-12 23:33:18 he could be looking at an oil sector contraction, i think he wants oil at 65-70
268 2018-11-12 23:33:13 @whatsuptucson need help selling please. Thanks 
This car runs. Has heat, a.c.  put new alternator with warranty, new battery with warranty, new window regulator, new fuel filter, just paid 1200 for rotors, pads and drums and oil change and new front windshield.
269 2018-11-12 23:33:11 Can’t imagine the publicity has done Iceland any good. Those animated by the retailer’s stance on palm oil will walk out in horror if they visit one of their stores, while their usual clientele would probably buy orangutan meat if it was sold in nugget form and on special offer.
270 2018-11-12 23:33:10 Yeah, oil is the answer, NOT! Look at Venezuela. Besides, we have plenty right here at home thanks to President Trump.
271 2018-11-12 23:33:09 Why did i just have a whole dream that i had 2 flat tires on the way to get my oil changed with @vcjohnson_ and it was storming outside then WE RAN OUT OF GAS 
272 2018-11-12 23:33:04 Oil Palm
273 2018-11-12 23:32:31 I forgot to take my CBD oil today and BOY did I notice it...more people started flooding into the laundromat and I didn't even notice I was breathing a lot faster, dozens of thoughts a second, distracted by the slightest sound or sight, and my shoulders were completely tensed up
274 2018-11-12 23:32:17 @realDonaldTrump Well, you've totally disgraced us on Veteran's Day by not showing up and participating like you should have in Paris, hoping? stupid shit about oil prices, evidently lost your Comcast cable for a minute and bitched about it, tried to walk back how you really
275 2018-11-12 23:32:15 Dubai’s population when oil was discovered was around 50,000. Nigeria’s was over 40 million... x800 the size. 

Notwithstanding other factors, Dubai did have more far more oil per head of population. About 86 times as much if I’ve got the maths right!
276 2018-11-12 23:32:11 Is that why the big money: Healthcare,War Profiteers,Big Oil,Big Pharma donate (own) both parties GOP and DEM? That's why healthcare will never be fixed & we'll continue to build weapons systems that can bounce & rebounce the rubble while outspending all countries combined.
277 2018-11-12 23:32:11 Electric cars!  No depending on foreign oil!!!
278 2018-11-12 23:32:08 House deep cleaned, soup in the crockpot, oil changed, muffins made and laundry done. I’d say it was a successful day off!
279 2018-11-12 23:32:04 I take it you are signed up to a fully renewable electricity supplier, never use gas or oil for hesting, and only use an electric car or a bicycle. If not, you are part of the problem, and a demonstration of how it takes time to effect real change. 

Either that or a hypocrite.
280 2018-11-12 23:31:59 Some of us have been avoiding palm oil containing products for years. My mum started me at it, for fucksake.

If this is 'news' to anyone, then everybody, including this absolute fuckwit, is terribly ignorant.

282 2018-11-12 23:31:27 Of course they are cheer leading the decision. Both are on record as not wanting pipelines & oil to stay in the ground. Why do you thing George Soros and pals keep pouring illegal election funds into the Liberal Party coffers?

283 2018-11-12 23:31:24 Most of them I think saw use in 2014's Heisei vs Showa, but that's still 4 years of sitting. Even in good storage they all need an oil change and thorough inspection to make sure they're safe to drive.

286 2018-11-12 23:30:54 Your response is absolutely ridiculous! There is no mention of Greenpeace in this ad. Enough of the BS! You endorse the Palm oil industry souly for financial gain! Ask Santa Claus for some morals & integrity this Christmas!

291 2018-11-12 23:29:16 If the @EdmontonOilers lose to the @CanadiensMTL tomorrow, then it’s time for the Oil to relieve McClean of his duties and bring in a proven HC that is a proven winner and that is Quenneville which I expect the @EdmontonOilers to hire him for sure and get them back in the
292 2018-11-12 23:29:03 wtf is the point of making an appointment if you still have to wait 2 hours .... for an oil change. I need to start doin this myself
293 2018-11-12 23:28:54 He’s in the oil field and he was like “once I go out of town for x months then she’ll probably just leave me” .... so you’ve been waiting 5 years for her to leave you lmao not to mention she doesn’t work and he provides everything... she’s not going to leave
294 2018-11-12 23:28:52 Just a replacement patty? What about the bun that soaked up dirty oil?
295 2018-11-12 23:28:48 It’s also very ethical and highly regulated but you keep cheering on those oil regimes who aren’t.
296 2018-11-12 23:28:40 cajuput oil, oleum-melaleuca-cajeputi, oleum cajeputi (minyak kayu putih)
297 2018-11-12 23:28:37 Be careful, oil fields nothing but lay offs. Reason why Jacob left. Go apply where he’s at now. They be getting quarterly bonuses and he just got another big check bc company is merging .
298 2018-11-12 23:28:17 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
299 2018-11-12 23:28:13 @HymanBrosKia Great job letting customers know when something in their contract had changed...apparently "Free Oil Changes and State Inspections FOR LIFE" is just for the life of the corporation, not the life of the car. Silly me.
300 2018-11-12 23:28:06 Exactly.  40 years ago we were going to run out.  Here we are today with oil to burn.  So to speak.
301 2018-11-12 23:28:04 As soon as I'm not happy with my cea drop/next scan. It'll be tricky as hell doing that in this weather but it'll get me more than ready for #sirt and possibly #ablation. That's what I'm shooting for next. Scan in 4 weeks. I've proper cut the sugars down too. Oil going back upto1
302 2018-11-12 23:27:48 I thought hemmotron was getting a noise complaint from room 304 cause he was getting an oil change if you know what I mean 
303 2018-11-12 23:27:46 That includes what's about to happen with the cannabis industry.  We are drowning in Canadian CBD OIL.  We need a lid on this as big pharma stampedes down their door to invest.  We AGAIN their target cash cow.
304 2018-11-12 23:27:37 And the room certainly shouldn’t be filling with oil while there is a cunning puzzle to solve too..
305 2018-11-12 23:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
306 2018-11-12 23:27:35 Oh no, not oil exploration.....
307 2018-11-12 23:27:31 Actually animals do die.. Unless ur growing ur own no diet is 100% free from killing animals. Pesticides for fruit and veg kill animals, harvesting machines kill animals. hate when people say that no animals died for me because its not true & many Vegan products contain palm oil
308 2018-11-12 23:27:27 I'm really confused by your comments.

Brent was in the high $20's during the depths of the oil downturn, it's now hovering around $70, profitable.

WCS was in the low to mid $20's during the depths of the downturn and is now struggling to stay above $10, disasterous.
309 2018-11-12 23:27:17 How does my phone know my car needs an oil change & that I was about to google valvoline & then it gives me an ad for valvoline?! Ugh. I should’ve left my phone in the pool & not gotten a new one. Creepy.
310 2018-11-12 23:27:17 I forget how many acres you have. Do you ever hear from oil and gas companies about leasing?
311 2018-11-12 23:27:13 Morning, rain, loading cargo Marine Fuel Oil @Singapore
312 2018-11-12 23:27:13 oil OPEC bs talk about cuts did not work ...
313 2018-11-12 23:27:12 looks like a 'particular' fund liquidated oil positions earlier. oil red 11 straight days, breaking 2 records. they would have to close red 12th day in a row. hard to see. im long 58.93
314 2018-11-12 23:27:06 Oil prices were lower under Obama
315 2018-11-12 23:26:47 Guess he smoked to much Moroccan hash oil...AND....
Bet his breath could knock over a camel 
316 2018-11-12 23:26:43 I used coconut oil instead of lotion and put on a onesie. I smell like a samoa cookie and I’m cozy af. Tonight is a good night.
317 2018-11-12 23:26:27 So you’re saying that as long as oil prices stay relatively low you’re fine with them murdering Khashoggi?  Have any other reporters in mind?
318 2018-11-12 23:26:24 I not burning no midnight oil cuz I haffa sleep
319 2018-11-12 23:26:24 Gold DSI is 7.  Dollar 91.  Oil 7.  Silver 9.  Gold similar levels to end of 2015.  I remember that period well.  Feels a lot like now.
320 2018-11-12 23:26:06 Really good that the awareness for boycotting palm oil is getting bigger. @IcelandFoods advert worked
321 2018-11-12 23:26:06 waiting on an oil change makes me sooooooooooooo annoyed 
322 2018-11-12 23:25:52 There’s a mountain of unfolded laundry waiting for me to fold it, groceries that need to be cooked, & a kitchen that needs to be cleaned.
You know what I’m about to do?
Cleanse & oil my scalp, give myself a facial, take a Goddess bath, do my nails, & go to sleep 
323 2018-11-12 23:25:40 A negotiated deal for oil through the Caspian Sea and a contract for the best quality morphine for hospitals worldwide would have saved Trillions for NATO in a completely wasted war in Afghanistan.  According to the WTO, America officially went bankrupt in July 2016.
324 2018-11-12 23:25:35 Grease your pans with coconut oil.

Never had a cake just fall out of the pan like that.
325 2018-11-12 23:25:35 Their shop would be empty, that's the problem, palm oil is in practically everything
326 2018-11-12 23:25:23 ISM will react even with this 23% down on oil another 10-15$ will send ISM below 50 I assume in a very quick way.
327 2018-11-12 23:25:16 He president not oil trader. Crude price not inflation. Trump micromanaging. Oil price shooud be concern of a civil servant in DOE. Not a president's. Like a kid putting fingers every where. A destructive guy indeed.
328 2018-11-12 23:25:12 What about your Butt Buddy Putin... he’s cutting oil supply too!!
329 2018-11-12 23:25:11 Sorry to ruin everyone’s day but Nutella has palm oil in
330 2018-11-12 23:25:09 A project worth exploring is building a oil pipeline from Waha to Manzanillo to export it to Asia. Pemex could take advantage of this system to feed Salamanca and Tula with Permian light oil. Fermaca and IEnova already have right of paths in place for CFE's led gas pipes...
331 2018-11-12 23:25:09 That’s what I said this Biggs said “I want oil and grease” 
332 2018-11-12 23:25:07 He is like a puppet suddenly coming alive. Coordination, which totally escapes him on the football or cricket field, suddenly flows as easily as oil! Everything becomes simple for him. Computer games are a piece of cake.

334 2018-11-12 23:24:54 Now we are getting somewhere. Lets identify who is payiong for what narrative. The  climate confusion narrative is clearly funded by big oil and is specifically geared to preserving the status quo.
335 2018-11-12 23:24:52 That's great.  Curious how much of our water supply will be contaminated in the process.  Also won't other countries continue to generate their own oil resulting an over abundance & needless ecological damage?  Won't an oil glut result in a taxpayer bailout of oil companies?
336 2018-11-12 23:24:42 I've read a few articles that banning palm oil completely isn't a good thing for a number of reasons. Greenpeace themselves aren't calling for it at the end of the original video. They ask to drop "dirty palm oil" as a food manufacturer it raises an interesting debate!
337 2018-11-12 23:24:39 Need oil for another CTR bot farm I guess *shrugs*
338 2018-11-12 23:24:36 Stop selling them arms. Embargo their oil. Seize their property in the uk. Stop accepting their dirty cash. Apply sanctions through the UN .... Or write a tweet and say you're very very angry. That might work too.
339 2018-11-12 23:24:32 Fish oil(omega 3 fatty acids)cuts heart attack risk and Vitamin D lowers the odds of cancer death
340 2018-11-12 23:24:20 Ooh a twist on the classic.

I managed not to get jalapeno oil in my eyes for the first time so it was a good day for me
341 2018-11-12 23:24:10 Really not interested in icky predictions of number and date of his poops. If having difficulties, recommend quart of castor oil.
342 2018-11-12 23:24:06 Just thought. With 1.3bln in bonds coming due,investigations,suppliers owed big,tax cuts going away, demand topping etc etc..if we are to go into a true bear market/recession $TSLA undoubtedly goes BK and housing,bonds,oil,dollar,interest rates all screaming this needs 2 happen
343 2018-11-12 23:23:16 #SaudiArabia seems to just like cutting up things.

Oil production and people.
344 2018-11-12 23:23:10 Google the Taylor Energy Oil Spill.
345 2018-11-12 23:23:07 or may not like with OPEC cuts oil went down another 2%...
346 2018-11-12 23:23:00 If we continue promoting fracked gas and dirty oil, then there will not be a sustainable planet left for future generations.

We need a massive mobilization to transform our energy system toward 100 percent renewables by 2035.

Anything less won’t be enough.
347 2018-11-12 23:22:57 Good info. That’s why I don’t use any oil at home.
348 2018-11-12 23:22:55 I've read a few articles that banning palm oil completely isn't a good thing for a number of reasons. Greenpeace themselves aren't calling for it at the end of the original video. They ask to drop "dirty palm oil" as a food manufacturer it raises an interesting debate!
349 2018-11-12 23:22:38 I did not see it, but I adore it. Thanks for tagging me.

What are you making with almond flour and olive oil, @jesKast?
350 2018-11-12 23:22:37 From your tweets, it looks like you're mostly concerned about oil and gas.
351 2018-11-12 23:22:35 YouTube skin care people: "Don'T PuT CoConUt OiL oN YoUr FaCe, iT cLoGs YoUr pOrEs."
Me: I don't wanna lie, your skin looks great but you will take coconut oil from my cold, dead, moisturized hands.
352 2018-11-12 23:22:26 My dad asked me last night if my car needed an oil change yet & I said I didn’t think so, but I’d look. Haha just looked and it was due for one over 200 miles ago.... oops
353 2018-11-12 23:22:21 Oil sands is the most water-, land-, waste- & GHG-intensive energy to produce...a logical target for eco-activism.
354 2018-11-12 23:22:08 long some oil from tad lower and spoos on this   sound optimistic
355 2018-11-12 23:22:06 oh and the mac salad is using whole wheat pasta and olive oil mayo. which I read all the light mayos are not healthy? and to just use plain ole 100% mayo (?!
356 2018-11-12 23:22:00 I have a rose quartz roller and I use it after I put on a facial oil, it's very cool and soothing. Also have you ever heard of Alexandra Potora? She's mainly on Instagram but she also has a YouTube channel and she does a lot of DIY skin care and things like that, she's amazing.
357 2018-11-12 23:21:57 i came to get my oil changed by myself for the first time...why didn’t anyone tell me it takes 5ever
358 2018-11-12 23:21:52 It's because big tech sales, oil spikes, and inflation. He's truly SO FULL OF SH!T
359 2018-11-12 23:21:30 Take away all that oil money you get in transfer payments, plus all the corporate welfare for Bombardier and Quebec would be another Venezuelan catastrophe. Your argument is invalid.
360 2018-11-12 23:21:24 Some essential oils can dissolve some plastics. That’s why they come in glass bottles. Don’t know what kind of plastic the vent is made of. Probably be OK because not much essential oil on the scent wedge.
361 2018-11-12 23:21:15 Saudi Arabia should remember that the USA has toppled other regimes for threatening oil prices.   Maybe we should play their game with food and military supplies. Wonder who will win. My bet is those that control the food supply will win.
362 2018-11-12 23:21:04 We might end up with “crying wolf” syndrome where Trump tweets about OPEC, Saudi Arabia, and oil prices lose significance with every additional tweet!
363 2018-11-12 23:20:58 Progress? Oh right....like, Deregulation, destroy the enviornment, oil pipelines, privatizing national lands, sky-high health care costs, tax cut for the wealthy 1% to name a few. Go fu*k off Kevin
364 2018-11-12 23:20:51 You'd expect fine art mediums would be sold in tight sealing containers, and not ones that leak after you've opened them. Really not happy about toxic gamsol leaking everywhere or having half of a $30+ bottle of coldpressed linseed oil leak out.
365 2018-11-12 23:20:40 Art, the drop in Oil prices was a cause and effect of Saudi overproducing to support Trump , now the production cuts begin and we will see Oil much higher .The Permian needs Higher prices to reflect True Costs
366 2018-11-12 23:20:34 Trump shtupped oil
Fool
367 2018-11-12 23:20:31 when you oil well all areas before inserting the cigar in the asshole
368 2018-11-12 23:20:04 Aren’t the globalists the ones who abused the UN “oil for food” program in Iraq to the tune of billions of dollars in graft?  Who would want to be a globalist?
369 2018-11-12 23:19:53 Take oil down another $10-15 points & ISM will react
370 2018-11-12 23:19:51 I found a bald spot on my head and I’ve never ordered castor oil and multi vitamins faster in my life
371 2018-11-12 23:19:50 Or stop annually importing $1.5 BILLION of Saudi oil into Canada, and buy Canadian.
372 2018-11-12 23:19:48 America now has more untapped oil than any other country on the planet. That's according to a new report from Rystad Energy that estimates the U.S. is sitting on an incredible 264 billion barrels of oil reserves.Jul 5, 2016
373 2018-11-12 23:19:43 Then why am I being charged $3.15/gallon for home heating oil. Gasoline prices are dropping.
374 2018-11-12 23:19:41 BC does nothing to clean the West Port Harbour or Ocean, and yet get a free pass for pollution. Does oil make people sick with disease? Does, Fecal matter make people die of disease? Gee, that's a Toughie?
375 2018-11-12 23:19:39 coconut oil massaged into the tatt
376 2018-11-12 23:19:33 I agree 100%. It’s like asking your neighbor to watch your home and defend it bc your not able to bc your busy operating your oil operation. There is no one that would do that for free for you! No one works for free so why should we put lives at risk, tax go to waste!!!!!!!!!!!!!
377 2018-11-12 23:19:12 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
378 2018-11-12 23:18:58 I remember when all you needed was money to eat when you went to ya patna house. Nowadays it cost about $200 to chill with ya patna. You gone buy some oil, go half on a 7th, go get some perks and hit the club. Now imagine doing this everyday. Wow

381 2018-11-12 23:18:32 @NBCNews SCHIFF'S COMMENTS ON NATIONALISM ARE TYPICAL SCHIFF. HE ALWAYS USES WORDS IN A MANNER THAT DO NOT MEET THE LOGIC TEST BUT ARE WORDS PEOPLE ATTACH A POSITIVE MEANING. IN MY OPINION HE REMINDS ME OF A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN. A PERSON NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

384 2018-11-12 23:18:23 FACTS: The oil was nationalised - so it's profits went to the Libyan people. They had free education, every new family was given a grant and a mortgage free home. He developed the largest irrigation system in the desert allow the people to have new farming land.
385 2018-11-12 23:18:22 It was over a few things, one prominent was oil. Zombie- " Same old team since 1916"
386 2018-11-12 23:18:14 @hasanminhaj we are loving #patriotact! You are killing it. 'Oil' was a tight show, and lots of solid jokes. Can't wait to watch the next one.
387 2018-11-12 23:18:12 Tell that to alaska. Oil economy hasn't recovered up there.
388 2018-11-12 23:18:08 Pasta sautéed with onions and oil. Add sun dried tomatoes and garlic.
389 2018-11-12 23:18:07 Wow. That is one high quality image you've got there. Well I think that settles it: climate change is clearly a hoax, burning oil is good for the trees, the UN is a big, shadowy, secret society, and... what else... Loch Ness... Big Foot... inner Earth... alien base on the moon?
390 2018-11-12 23:18:03 Yep.  And the Yemenis are still dead and dying, which, is the point of a war and the saudis are still rich and doing oil business with everyone. So, you know, maybe their war is working better for them than you think?
391 2018-11-12 23:18:00 aku suka tgk story miro updates life dia psl pilot-to-be, ina engineer oil gas kot, elmi review/share tips, lin share resepi,mawa ttg life bdk mascom, diyana life kt us, sofi as meds student.. whoelse?
392 2018-11-12 23:18:00 Because oil is a fungible commodity and we will never produce enough to set prices on the world market.
393 2018-11-12 23:17:56 When the midnight oil burns past 1am and you barely notice 
394 2018-11-12 23:17:44 @Wallace_Energy This is 7 days without a follow up.  Imagine needing oil with no response for 7 days! @MeenanServices are ALL of your "sister" companies this terrible?  How does your relationship work anyway? #customerservice #oil
395 2018-11-12 23:17:42 Say, wasn't that Standard Oil's motto before the President brought down the Sherman Anti-Trust hammer?
396 2018-11-12 23:17:16 No. I can read price charts. The claim was that while the price of oil has increased worldwide it has not increased in Canada. This is not true.
397 2018-11-12 23:17:14 Have you seen Hasan Minaj’s Netflix show “Patriot Act?” Latest episode is “Oil.” Brilliant analysis.
398 2018-11-12 23:17:08 Not to mention that since the oil sands are producing anyways, why not get top $? Some of which will most definitely go to alternative energy methods.
399 2018-11-12 23:17:07 #venezuela oil industry at the mercy of #russia and #china.. as simple as that.
400 2018-11-12 23:16:53 Thank God for wild growth and castor oil. My edges are growing back and it’s only been about a week and a half.
401 2018-11-12 23:16:50 p irresponsible to sell beard oil in transinfinite quantities
402 2018-11-12 23:16:44 It’s Hard Work, But if you aren’t afraid of it you can make Great money,  it’s also beats up the body 
403 2018-11-12 23:16:41 I hope everyone attacking this better not be driving a car, warming their house or using electricity since almost all the energy used to do these things and create them as well comes from good ole Oil.
404 2018-11-12 23:16:40 The drump administration has cut funding for the federal forest service. If it was up to drump he would take away all public lands, allow oil drilling, and concrete over the rest of the land.
405 2018-11-12 23:16:19 i had to buy 3 tires and get a oil change ima get a bike with the baby seat on the back
406 2018-11-12 23:16:15 Maybe it's time to stop exporting our oil or go for renewable energy sources. Good for the planet, good for the people. #FreeEnergyForAll

413 2018-11-12 23:15:30 6:16pm 12 NOV currently *NO WAIT* For State Inspections, oil change, alignment, diagnostic, why wait when there is a Carmasters Vehicle Available at Carmasters Automotive for you to drive while yours is getting repaired #inspection #oilchange #brakes #alignment
414 2018-11-12 23:15:29 ??? So many choices ???  I would go for someone with real power... the Koch brothers maybe or the ceo of an oil company. The president is to obvious and well guarded
415 2018-11-12 23:15:22 Respect the service. Respect the man. #GOPComplicit. Is he going to vote to help everyone vote? Is he going to vote to send troops to the border to cage children? Is he going to vote to support this traitor of a president? #GOPValues are anti-US. Dad was in the oil & gas biz. 
416 2018-11-12 23:15:18 Lol...Sounds like you're demanding. It's their Oil, if you don't like the price, then you negotiate or find another supplier.
417 2018-11-12 23:15:12 And the Saudi cartel is decreasing oil production 
Giddy up, Camel 
418 2018-11-12 23:15:10 Alright, in your last sentence you rightly identify a disconnect between supply and prices. That might well be related to declining demand (energy transition!). But your first sentence asks for continuous oil supply to keep prices low. Two completely contradictory sentences.
419 2018-11-12 23:14:47 We will run out of oxygen before running out of oil.  Roughly 10 parts oxygen 1 part gasoline for an internal combustion gasoline engine. Diesels are much more efficient. I'm assuming you never fly in a jet anywhere, or maybe you fly in a solar one?
420 2018-11-12 23:14:39 Can’t believe it was banned! Although it looks as if it has reached a huge audience on social media. I love it and think it’s a great way to get the message about palm oil to the public. Hopefully people will become more aware and boycott brands containing it.
421 2018-11-12 23:14:33 If oil is so expensive how do you keep your coat so thick, orange and silky?
422 2018-11-12 23:14:29 If you get your feelings hurt easy don’t bother thinking of it! Some of the best work in this industry hard working and some very smart people when you are pumping 12k psi on a well it will make you respect it and the people you work with for sure lost some good friends to it!
423 2018-11-12 23:14:27  #YouHateThis  RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
424 2018-11-12 23:14:26 Maybe you shouldn't have pulled out of the Iran deal and ruined a good supply of oil.
425 2018-11-12 23:14:26 On a national level, Canadian oil producers will lose almost 9 B$ since 2016 because they are forced to sell at steep discount from market price. Maybe the Maritimes no longer needs transfer payments.
426 2018-11-12 23:14:20 That is because Trump is a coward. Thinks he knows everything when in fact he knows nothing.  He is a snake oil salesman. Six year old mentality.
427 2018-11-12 23:14:16 Stop putting coconut or coconut oil in everything some of us are allergic and eating it makes us sick or in my daughters case use and epi pen.
428 2018-11-12 23:13:44 YES to avoiding palm oil. Soy is currently mostly fed to livestock, I believe. Almond milk is a no-no for me; it uses A LOT of water.

434 2018-11-12 23:13:30 Man, so Han is having a really bad week and said she doesn't want to cook, so i planned out meals for the whole week and tonight i made a chili macaroni and cheese and roasted sea salt & olive oil broccoli and an apple crisp
435 2018-11-12 23:13:29 Oil line looks sweet as in the black coil as protection
436 2018-11-12 23:13:16 ended up not needing a second coat on the ceiling, so did the walls. That'll need 2 coats for sure. Maybe even a third.

Discovered stains on the new floor. Going to deal w/ those once the main painting is done. Not too worried; can come up w/ some oil.
437 2018-11-12 23:13:08 thank you @LlamadeLuna for spreading your essential oil wisdom  everyone needs to check it out
438 2018-11-12 23:12:58 Am i the only one who doesnt care for alfredo sauce at all? Id literally take no sauce with oil and cheese over it
439 2018-11-12 23:12:53 Some vegans don't consume soy/palm oil. Some do. This a huge debate in the vegan community about this
440 2018-11-12 23:12:41 My bad, I'm all over the palm oil cartoons because they remind me of Lilo & Stitch
441 2018-11-12 23:12:41 that's like just peppermint oil at that point
442 2018-11-12 23:12:36 he hands you a tub of motor oil
443 2018-11-12 23:12:21 Oil/gasoline prices in UK are largely determined by taxation, not market value. Until this changes, you are pissing against the wind.
444 2018-11-12 23:12:18 But I love putting oil in my hair 
445 2018-11-12 23:12:04 When you now live in #NewBrooklyn and your #bodega went and got all fancy with 12 types of olive oil, a selection of fancy #cheeses and fresh produce, but it's still #OldBrooklyn enough that the tomatoes are slightly rotten, and they don't have a basic block of parmesan.
446 2018-11-12 23:12:03 body oil is superior
447 2018-11-12 23:12:02 TARRIFS, INTEREST RATES. OIL PRICES. Rex Tillerson was right.

449 2018-11-12 23:11:44 *as Tim silently adds baby oil to Amazon wish list*
450 2018-11-12 23:11:41 They should be much, much higher based on how long it took the earth to produce it. Ridiculous that we use up in 200 years what took millions of years to produce. Also need to take account the impact of burning all this oil in such a short amount of time.
451 2018-11-12 23:11:38 ..collected less taxes in $ value doing so. They need to focus on economy & job creating projects & yes I am pro the pipeline & spending more in Alberta to get our oil it’s fair value. You can’t spend aimlessly without a strategy that results in an increase in GDP
452 2018-11-12 23:11:37 You are no oil painting though !
453 2018-11-12 23:11:23 That’s only one kind of Alberta oil, Western Canadian Select. There are 5 other kinds selling for over $40 per barrel and 1 selling for over $60 per barrel.
454 2018-11-12 23:11:22 Because the USA is producing oil!! Prices are dropping because the chains placed by Obama is gone, low oil prices = cheap fuels

456 2018-11-12 23:11:11 Companies can’t spin on a heel and suddenly go in a different direction.
They’re like oil tankers: slow to get up to speed, slow to turn, slow to stop. The consequences of a no deal are so potentially severe, many companies aren’t waiting to execute their contingency plans.
457 2018-11-12 23:11:06 The Arctic, onshore and offshore, contains vital energy resources that can reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil and improve the national balance of payments.
458 2018-11-12 23:10:51 Possibly denied by the same people who say that wind and solar power cannot run out lives and we must continue to burn coal and oil…

461 2018-11-12 23:10:49 Everything - bloody everything has palm oil in  a cheap filler for so many products and companies don't even seem ashamed how much they rely on it despite the consequences of it's production
462 2018-11-12 23:10:38 Still need to get it out of Alberta and Saskatchewan, that means pipelines. Also we have refineries in Canada that top up production with oil from other countries, we get our oil to them and thus reduce oil dependacy from others.

465 2018-11-12 23:10:22 Perhaps look at more than just what the conservatives marketed. During a period of time where oil was at record price and oil companies were making record profits AB ended up with the largest income disparity in the country.
466 2018-11-12 23:10:18 And? Nothing has changed, Canada is still buying Saudi oil. Canada let China prevent our media from covering a speech by @Bill_Morneau in China.
467 2018-11-12 23:10:14 Make a mixture then on the side with red pepper mixed in hot red oil to add.

Also known as the Gulf of Mexico.
475 2018-11-12 23:09:52 We need to stop buying from OPEC and only buy domestic crude, please! Also, bring every American soldier and weapon home from the Middle East!  We don't need their oil, so let them kill each other!!! Hundreds of billions of dollars saved!!!
476 2018-11-12 23:09:41 That Johnson’s baby oil gel the best shit you can buy when it start getting cold outside and you just hopped out the shower.
477 2018-11-12 23:09:41 Or oil prices should be much, much higher to better reflect the real price including the damage to the environment. This would also encourage planet sustaining renewables.
478 2018-11-12 23:09:17 Or that oil is made from dead ones.

485 2018-11-12 23:08:31 Yup 30 yrs offshore oilfield for me , missed half of everything.

sis i know. “it wasn’t making a sound?” lmfao NO
488 2018-11-12 23:08:11 I was one of a handful of people who was bearish on oil this year. I have also been warning about the disaster that is coming due to the massive borrowing by the trumplicans.  I am the last person you should be "warning" with partisan narratives.
489 2018-11-12 23:07:59 That's not how the industry works. OPEC exists to fix export prices among oil producing countries. But you've gone out of your way to kill alternative energy, so this is what we are left with.
490 2018-11-12 23:07:58 Here are things that non fiction children’s books or their authors/illustrators have influenced in our house this year: supporting refugees,stopping buying palm oil and starting feeding birds, 7 YO daughter wants to be a scientist.

494 2018-11-12 23:07:47 So you’re trying to kill the American oil industry now? To fill in some of the free space in your brain.... if oil isn’t at minimum $65 bbl (WTI) then producers will drastically decrease producing . Leaving 1000s out of work.

497 2018-11-12 23:07:33 So many products made with palm oil, especially margarine-type spreads. 
We all need to do our part to not pass on a planet devoid of wild animals
498 2018-11-12 23:07:32 We need to conserve oil not sell it, biggest mistake lifting ban on crude exports.

504 2018-11-12 23:07:13 Why did Obama insist Isis was given 30 minutes warning before bombings?
Why did Obama never bomb the oil train that Isis was driving to Turkey where Erdogan's son bought it and handed over cash to fund terrorism?
Why was Obama helping Iran gain nuclear capability?
He is a traitor
505 2018-11-12 23:06:34 I don't really have a go to meal. What I try to do is find substitutes for food I already eat. So if I'm using oil, for instance, I think what's the healthiest oil for me to use? Coconut oil or olive oil. If I'm eating sweets, I replace those with fruit etc etc.

507 2018-11-12 23:05:58 Generally true the oil majors have higher breakeven price but smaller independents can make money at lower prices. Breakeven also varies by oil play (e.g., Bakken vs. Permian vs. offshore GoM). Breakeven for smaller operators in some plays can be as low as $45.
508 2018-11-12 23:05:50 I go to the Honda dealership to get my oil changed so I can be called "ma'am" by a seventeen year old wearing a suit.

531 2018-11-12 23:03:20 Coconut oil isn't always a good option, cause the molecules in coconut oil are very big for curly hair and so the hair can't always absorb the oil. Try using lighter oils like almond and jojoba oil. I mean, it may make a big difference but I still got issues so yea lol

555 2018-11-12 23:01:10 Yeah we need to slow down the transition from heating oil to help the environment...
556 2018-11-12 23:01:09 I am skeptical of industry sponsored study which diverges from all the other fish oil studies .  Maybe their formulation is better, but I’d love to see the study replicated
557 2018-11-12 23:01:06 Not everyone. Maybe the military does, but in 9-5 private sector families, working Thanksgiving (or sometimes even Christmas) for extra pay is not unheard of, and often considered a blessing. My point was, Hogg has no idea how most families live, like most of the media.
558 2018-11-12 23:00:52 OOH, have you tried roasting delicata squash with olive oil/salt/pepper/Parmesan?? HEAVENLY.
559 2018-11-12 23:00:48 And how would you have addressed the break up of Breton Woods, the impact of the Arab oil embargo etc. How would you have addressed these issues differently?

565 2018-11-12 23:00:21 Oil change guys have absolutely zero car knowledge/education. They’re just following a checklist of tasks. Their boss is also always pushing them to sell service options because that’s where their big money comes from. They often make things out to be worse than they are
566 2018-11-12 23:00:20 Venezuela has the largest reserves of crude oil in the world, its production has diminished ... maybe it's time to sit down and talk with Maduro ..
567 2018-11-12 23:00:20 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Tax this money 50% and build the wall, President Trump
568 2018-11-12 22:59:50 Heard all of the amazing stories so I gave it a try...  Verdict:

CBD Oil - I'm allergic. 

This is what you find out now when you never smoked pot when you were young, or ever.
569 2018-11-12 22:59:43 i told my mom how much pain i was in and she was like "you should try CBD oil" ok ma
570 2018-11-12 22:59:33 Dear future husband, I’m not rushing you but I sure would like you to take my car to get detailed and get my oil changed so I don’t have to! Lol
571 2018-11-12 22:59:12 Yes, my county can be red b/c its rural, there are a lot of hunters, and we have a HUGE amount of fracking and people into the oil & gas industries here.  Also, a lot of farmers.  There is work to be done in Weld!
572 2018-11-12 22:59:06 Ted, I wasn't talking about consumption. I was talking about how the oil companies gave set up the infrastructure which includes pricing.
The people pay for this lack of foresight in their government.
573 2018-11-12 22:58:59 Ya wanna know what else is offensive. Your carbon taxes. Being against pipelines when you got office then thinking oil workers would forget when you changed your stance this year. And actually thinking your getting a second term. Lol
574 2018-11-12 22:58:51 Which serves vinegar and oil shots.
575 2018-11-12 22:58:42 It's time to get off of the Saudi oil and invest in alternative energy. Let those murderers drown in their oil!

It has $103 bil in net debt & is big corporate issuer in iShares JPM USD #EmergingMarket ETF ($EMB) @ ~3% of holdings #energy
579 2018-11-12 22:58:24 Why would anyone want to behave this circularly? Having to want to believe it before being able to believe it is generally a good indicator of some snake oil bullshit.
580 2018-11-12 22:58:24 For a game or two I'm fine w/ it but still think best case scenario would be Leon & RNH on the 2nd line. However, leaving your franchise player to do his best w/ spare parts isn't exactly something that excites me or likely their captain. Still can't believe they have no wingers.
581 2018-11-12 22:58:10 I use CANTU! I have the curl activator cream and the daily oil moisturizer and I also use Garner Fructis leave in conditioner it’s a little green bottle. (Not all at once, obviously) I’ve been using these forever and I love them!

585 2018-11-12 22:58:02 And what is this doing to our planet? Nothing good. More oil spills, more carbon in our atmosphere, warmer climate, floods, more short-term wealth and consumption, more plastic...

596 2018-11-12 22:57:11 It feels to me like the country is rapidly disintegrating. Trust in our national institutions is plummeting. Our coherence as a society is fragmenting. Climate disaster is impending and our leaders (owned by oil) can't even agree that it's happening let alone what to do about it.
597 2018-11-12 22:57:10 @hondaofpasadena Why does it take 5.5 hours to get an oil change and a complementary car wash?

600 2018-11-12 22:56:43 Yeah they’re slime balls like that. I went to a jiffy lube once and a new guy forgot to put any oil in my car at all. Within ten minutes of driving away my engine seized completely and they ended up having to pay me the book value of the car
601 2018-11-12 22:56:40 I'm not good at new years resolutions but I'm wanting a focus. Therefore I pledge from my hair dye to my footcream and everything inbetween where possible in 2019 I'm pledging to go palm oil free

606 2018-11-12 22:55:54 I really am so dumb. Only I would lock my key in my car when I brought it in for an oil change. 
607 2018-11-12 22:55:41 Considering all those items come from America.  I would think that is good.  And Gasoline/oil is down btw.
608 2018-11-12 22:55:38 Cut offshore sales until supply-demand get citizens' cost to $50 cents a gallon! President Trump, Americans are crushed by oil cartel overhead costs.  We could be blessed MIGHTILY by your setting prices CHEAP for gas-a-gallon.  NO ONE WOULD EVER FORGET it's IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS!
609 2018-11-12 22:55:29 I hope gas goes up to $5 a gal...we need to get away from fossil fuels and the dependency on foreign oil.

613 2018-11-12 22:54:55 America produces the most oil in the world yet we pay so much. Oil companies make $ billions & lobby politicians for protection.
614 2018-11-12 22:54:54 If you are agreeing that coal should feel the carbon tax as much as anybody you'll get no argument from me. Meanwhile oil and gas and every other industry will be feeling the carbon tax & responding as designed. You STILL provide literally NO alternative
615 2018-11-12 22:54:51 Literally a 20 minute drive to Walmart is UNACCEPTABLE! but there's no way I'm paying TWICE the amount for oil at any auto shop. So I guess I'm going to Victoria Gardens.

624 2018-11-12 22:53:56 So I'm writing a scene where May's translation chip fails and it goes from funny to heartwrenching faster than oil jumps from a hot skillet.  Talk about emotional whiplash
625 2018-11-12 22:53:55 Ah, what about American oil? Don't you support your OWN country and their production?  What's wrong with you? You must know as old as you are.
626 2018-11-12 22:53:38 If you had stayed in Iran Nuclear Deal until you negotiated a better deal, you would have not handed Saudi Arabia and Russia such dominance in the supply and control of oil prices!

630 2018-11-12 22:53:12 Yes. But until the government stops their obsession with oil, those smaller companies will never get their proper financial growth.
Canada should be starting solar and geothermal power in a big way, but we continue to pay whatever opec decides is the pricing on oil. It is lazy.

634 2018-11-12 22:53:01 Hey! Here’s an idea, butthead! How about investing/innovating in cleaner, alternative fuel sources so we don’t have to fret and hope over the cost of fucking OIL forever and ever?
635 2018-11-12 22:52:53 I think OPEC has long experience in oil marketing and price control, they know their job very well.
Just relax Mrs President..

637 2018-11-12 22:52:46 The United States this year became the largest crude oil producer, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia, according to preliminary estimates from the Energy Information Administration. So shouldn't our gas prices be down already? Instead of going up.
638 2018-11-12 22:52:36 @allieil My dog gets the oil, but I don't think it works. :\ Not strong enough for me, either (or so say my friends who know shit about correct dosing).
639 2018-11-12 22:52:25 Meanwhile, we keep pumping the Saudi oil because we are far too stupid and weak to build a badly needed pipeline to the East. Federal spine collapse and now their tankers jam the St. Lawrence.
640 2018-11-12 22:52:19 I bet they are reading your tweet and saying to themselves “oh, we better not cut oil production”. Just kidding. They are probably laughing their asses off at you for letting them get away with murder.
641 2018-11-12 22:52:13 IT'S SAUDI ARABIA and ISRAEL who pushed the UNITED STATES into pulling out of the IRAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEAL, it's both who want a REGIME CHANGE in IRAN, ie when SANCTIONS against IRAN are imposed on their OIL ,it's SAUDI ARABIA who will get to sell the OIL that IRAN can't sell
642 2018-11-12 22:52:09 
643 2018-11-12 22:52:09 That’s not exactly true. As you know it’s the largest contiguous number of price declining days on the futures market. Futures trading of oil only started in 1983. Oil has been sold a bit longer than that. Why are you so addicted to misleading stories.
644 2018-11-12 22:52:02 What is going to stop them they murdered that journalist raising oil prices is nothing

646 2018-11-12 22:51:42 Wait,
1. I thought you said the USA was exporting oil? 
2. The world is in recession because of your tariffs, so no one needs oil.
3. You stopped the supply of oil from Iran.
You have no idea what you are doing, do you.
647 2018-11-12 22:51:40 I make mine with multi colored fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, multicolored carrots and parsnips with fresh cranberries whole sprinkled in.

648 2018-11-12 22:51:40 My car is so embarrassing. I went to get the oil changed and they couldn’t open the front hood 
649 2018-11-12 22:51:39 We should be keeping the oil extracted in America, here in America and stop depending on foreign oil.
650 2018-11-12 22:51:27 another lie, we produce more oil than any other nation.  Our oil companies dictate our oil prices now opec nations have very little to do with it

674 2018-11-12 22:48:31 that's how i got mine yesterday - oil splatter from flipping over a swordfish steak. but i should've been wearing an oven mitt for that (as should you)! next time
675 2018-11-12 22:48:25 I try to but it's almost impossible because they don't always use a name you'd recognise as palm oil in products, it's hard, for example there's not one marg/ spread that doesn't contain it 
676 2018-11-12 22:48:21 Lots of problems with the Oil...starts with the GM and works it's way down....won't matter who is in net the d isn't good enough.. this current slide teams have played them more physically and they don't have an answer...time to put Zac on top line to create some room for 97 & 93
677 2018-11-12 22:48:11 Well they better be nice to us since we sold the all those wepinz!.

Why not increase efficiency, explore domestic sources and tell them to keep their oil?
678 2018-11-12 22:48:11 Very true. My mum is proof. I've learnt to appreciate my oily skin. Just have lots of tissue around for the oil production. 
679 2018-11-12 22:48:07 We need @realDonaldTrump to sign an EO stating:

688 2018-11-12 22:47:02 All Jiffy Lubes today- Free oil change for veterans/ active duty
689 2018-11-12 22:47:01 Remember it was SAUDI ARABIA who gave us the phony bullshit INTELLIGENCE information that got us into a  WAR with IRAQ in 1990-1991 it was SAUDI ARABIA who sat those OIL WELLS in KUWAIT on FIRE, it was SAUDI ARABIA who gave us the 911 TERRORISTS, who knew about them and refused
690 2018-11-12 22:46:46 I have a pretty big oil leak in my Jeep but the only way to fix it is to pull the whole engine out and I have no way of doing that and don’t wanna pay $1,000+ for them to do it. So I just get an oil change every 3,000 miles and they make sure it’s filled back up for me :)
691 2018-11-12 22:46:45  Betty White. That made me chuckle. Fair point Oil were good. Btw, it’s easy to flop around when a glove or a single pad thrown up covers half the net. Yesterday’s goalie had to stand, come out, use angles.
692 2018-11-12 22:46:41 So this is why Trump is trash talking SA, today? Rather than admit what happened to that respected journalist, @realDonaldTrump has chosen to tweet about oil prices. POTUS is a disgrace.
693 2018-11-12 22:46:35 I'll have to try that next time! I unfortunately burn myself while cooking all the time...just last night I got a big burn mark on my arm from oil splatter while browning some chicken.
694 2018-11-12 22:46:32 Lemon juice, olive oil, and parm 
695 2018-11-12 22:46:16 I did just a simple method. Some salt and olive oil. Ain't nothing fancy I'm doing. I'm not burning down my house.
696 2018-11-12 22:46:10 om put some vitamin e oil on them boo

698 2018-11-12 22:46:09 Is that all the hell you thinking about looser Donald Trump's people lost their lives and all you can tweet about is oil.... You are so out the office on the next election WATCH
699 2018-11-12 22:46:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but federal law enforcement.
700 2018-11-12 22:46:03 As far as misinformation, snake oil remedies, and no informed consent......that would be you!
701 2018-11-12 22:46:02 If you need your oil changed, car tuned up, or brakes done get at me!
702 2018-11-12 22:45:56 Lmaooo no i tried the take 5 guy but I still had to pay full price for my oil change 
703 2018-11-12 22:45:56 use castor oil it help them grow
704 2018-11-12 22:45:32 Get where Spears is coming from but don't necessarily agree w/ it. Had he been forced to play against better players growing up, Wiggins likely would've improved and learned how to push himself. It likely came fairly easy to him, unlike Nash, who had to work for every inch he got
705 2018-11-12 22:45:31 The biggest thing to remember is that oil leaks aren’t really an issue as long as you stay on top of them. Did they indicate at the oil change how much oil was missing? If its just a little bit then who cares. If a lot‘s missing then just get oil changes more frequently to top up
706 2018-11-12 22:45:26 Support vets by not putting people in office that will put them in wars over oil
707 2018-11-12 22:45:23 Sadie wondered if an oak tree could really know about sunflowers. Would a tree know as much as a person did? How delicious the seeds were when salted, for example, and how you could make sunflowers into the oil that her mother used for cooking.

711 2018-11-12 22:44:50 Trump tweeted, "Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!" 
That was the point of his BIG LIE that Iran violated the Nuclear Deal! Oil prices were too low and the Saudis wanted to raise them. GMAB!
712 2018-11-12 22:44:43 Si notan como todos están hablando sobre SIBO -> la solución es súper fácil -> Wild Oregano Oil    Fácil      En el año debemos limpiar el hígado, remover metales pesados o exceso de hormonas, limpieza renal, empujar el sistema linfático y desparasitar.  Es fácil

720 2018-11-12 22:44:24 There is no clean oil under late capitalism
721 2018-11-12 22:44:12 my coconut oil was hard as a rock so I thought I should microwave it. It went up in flames. and I’m not cut out for life.
722 2018-11-12 22:44:12 I LOVE this oil!  I use it every day and feel amazing
723 2018-11-12 22:44:10 There was this cartoon my grandparents had I would watch as a kid. It was called “Samson and Sally” and is about whales and the villains are whalers. There’s also an oil spill. That’s a cartoon villain that can mess a kid’s shit up.

726 2018-11-12 22:43:44 Yep made a coconut oil crack and now my feed blowing up with outrage from liberal snowflakes
727 2018-11-12 22:43:44 im deadass stressing out so much not only am i saving up for getting my braces off which will be 850$ i also have to get new truck tires that are like 630 for 3 of them, and im trying to save for an apt AND MY OIL KEEPS LEAKING OUT OF MY TRUCK AND IM SO STRESSED IM GONNA CRY
728 2018-11-12 22:43:38 By that logic everything is a stock. Why is oil a commodity and not a stock? You pay cash in exchange for equity in oil.
729 2018-11-12 22:43:38 On the other hand coconut oil is awesome!
730 2018-11-12 22:43:35 Alternatively if your car is dripping oil onto the ground you should be able to get up underneath and follow the trail of breadcrumbs back home.
731 2018-11-12 22:43:33 Let's make crude oil prices ten times higher to counter its environmental consequences. Promote solar, and oceanic oscillation.
732 2018-11-12 22:43:30 What on Earth makes you think I have supplies to make cupcakes?  I have...sugar, oil, and eggs (if they’re not rotten yet...) lmfao
733 2018-11-12 22:43:23 This is not Trump.  It's the cost of crude oil that has gone down.
734 2018-11-12 22:43:11 Trump - Are you now advocating a Centrally Planed Economy now on oil production? Yeah, it's happened already.  You must of heard of it - it's called "Communism".

Keep up...
735 2018-11-12 22:43:09 Perhaps the killing of a US resident and journalist in side the Saudi consulate in Turkey will distract the Saudis enough that they forget to cut oil production. You seem to have forgotten about it already. #FakePresident
736 2018-11-12 22:43:06 i needa take my ass to school, this oil field shit is getting old..
737 2018-11-12 22:43:00 You are right! Everyone should see this!  Not political...simply truthful... People! Stop using palm oil (toothpaste, shampoo, lotion, etc)!   What is happening in the rain forests is horrific! Orangutans burned alive....
738 2018-11-12 22:42:51 Hmm so everything I’ve been reading about has no indication of a common point of failure in 2011 Aveos. It’s common for engines to be dirty, but maybe look under the hood for anywhere that’s got a layer of black sludge that would indicate oil is leaking and mixing with the dirt?
739 2018-11-12 22:42:29 so good for Trump ego  everyweek analysts ,TV channels, are talking how he makes the market crash  and nobody understand his view of crude oil 1960 s prices .  OK not $100 a barrel bit cheap as 1960 s   when crude oil goes up market goes up
740 2018-11-12 22:42:12 I keep hearing that Les. Why don’t they like him? Has he got a gump on his nose? Frankly he’s no oil painting and he does nothing for me but so what.
741 2018-11-12 22:42:11 @NTB my mom got her oil changed at Airpark Gaithersburg, they didnt put the $320 engine cover back on. She works from home so doesnt drive much and my dad was checking her oil the other day and saw it was missing  and went back to get it back and got chewed out by the manager?!?!
742 2018-11-12 22:42:10 If anyone is looking for a good deal on their oil change make sure you come see me before 6 o’clock tonight

744 2018-11-12 22:42:07 If the government finds oil or diamonds in your backyard its government property but if they find drugs its yours
745 2018-11-12 22:41:37 You do this for a living? US foreign policy has huge impact on oil prices. Failure to admit that brands you as either a political hack or worse

Should u purse another field that more closely suits your intelligence level?

Janitor? Burger flipping? No shame in honest hard work
746 2018-11-12 22:41:28 Oil is medieval... stop the Saudis butchers !
747 2018-11-12 22:41:28 Add masks, preferably clay, to help draw out any particles that are settling in your pores. Aztec clay is still hands down the best for this. Oil cleansing/double cleansing may also be helpful and help keep your skin moisturized if it’s particularly dry.
748 2018-11-12 22:41:17 Looks like oil hit 58.75 at EOD and bounced a little due to tweet by Trump.
Looks like he delayed the bounce to get the situation you mentioned above. Now let's bounce.
749 2018-11-12 22:41:11 Sooo I’ve just discovered that Sodium Lauryl Sulphate which is in most of our soapy/shower gel/foamy products is derived from Palm Oil 
750 2018-11-12 22:41:05 The latest study of a prescription version of the fish oil pill found a 20-25% decrease in your chances of getting a heart attack.  I think Vascepa is the brand name.
751 2018-11-12 22:41:05 Okay, but definitely don't talk about NORTH KOREA today, since we just found out that they are upgrading some of their launch facilities. 

Also don't talk about the fact that you were directly involved in PAYING OFF A PORN STAR. So, yeah, today it's definitely oil prices.
752 2018-11-12 22:40:55 I’m a loud mouth, proud fucking atheist, why should a preacher be advertising on Twitter?  You sell snake oil to sick people and support trump. You cannot be trusted to tell the truth nor to act in the best interests of others.

756 2018-11-12 22:40:24 Your first sentence is a straight lie anyone can find by simple google search. I have no interest in continuing a conversation with you. I am glad you have found some interesting reading but it doesn't give you the right to cause harm through misinformation & snake oil remedies
757 2018-11-12 22:40:19 Well, it's a holiday. Yet, all the oil and propane companies in WMass were active in delivering today so that the 11F predicted for Wed. night is covered. Alas, we still count on this.

759 2018-11-12 22:40:06 Yes, for California, that's business as usual, not to say we shouldn't #BeBest at trying to avoid it. Providing the crude oil demanded by 40 million people. (It's that NIMBY thing again).
760 2018-11-12 22:39:50 How did I manage to get a flat tire on my way to get an oil change ask me how my evening is going
761 2018-11-12 22:39:48 OIL PRICES ARE NOT LOWER BECAUSE AN *IDIOT* DID CANCEL THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
762 2018-11-12 22:39:48 #Channel4News interviewed Tom Wheeler, Director of Regulation at OGA (Oil and Gas Authority).

Terrifying!

He regulates UK fracking.

He admits to not knowing the geology, knows very little about fracking and hasn't read relevant OGA web pages.

The Gove principle triumphant.
763 2018-11-12 22:39:41 So Trump added IRANIAN sanctions to help raise domestic oil prices?
764 2018-11-12 22:39:40 The stock market is down because of your trade war with China and the Saudi assholes are going to cut production of oil. Saudi Arabia has already threatened the US it we put sanctions on them for their murderous actions against a reporter in Turkey.
765 2018-11-12 22:39:40 You are a disgrace to NZ for how you behave. Just like when you showed up in a suit on the beach we were cleaning the Rena oil up on and called us sorry loosers off camera.
766 2018-11-12 22:39:26 Deliberately planned oil price risescreated by Iran sanctions on Iran . That way Saudi jacked their prices and we have the pleasure of paying for Saudi Armourments purchases . It's all made worse by murder in Yemen and of the Journolist . Sad
767 2018-11-12 22:39:16 "A 35-year-old Oregon man died as a result of an explosion and fire caused by a hash oil operation he and a friend were conducting in a garage." should definitely not be listed there. They from an explosion, not marijuana.
768 2018-11-12 22:39:12 Oil was up and down before that. Saudi didn’t raise anything yet but they will
769 2018-11-12 22:39:11 Whether snake oil or not, a movement has begun. And enlarges daily. Sheep no more.
770 2018-11-12 22:39:02 "Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!" -@realDonaldTrump @2020Upstream translation: "You're ruining all the work the PPT and I have done, to rig oil prices lower, to try to save our fragile economy."
771 2018-11-12 22:39:01 .@CNBCFastMoney Carter has been wrong twice:  $AAPL after earnings and Oil, one or two weeks ago.  What’s up??
772 2018-11-12 22:38:57 Great to see the government is continuing to offer help to local businesses, just like the help it offered it to the oil business in aberdeen..oh wait it didn’t #aberdeen #Michelin #oilandgas

777 2018-11-12 22:38:33 I got some oil and shampoo for too much money smh
778 2018-11-12 22:38:20 And you just lost Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and all the other oil producing states.
779 2018-11-12 22:38:16 The price of oil isn’t up in Canada? Are you reading the chart upside-down?
780 2018-11-12 22:38:13 I feel Iran needs to attack Saudi Arabia and we will see things go down at that point. I still feel Iran will accidentally hit an oil refinery in Saudi Arabia. Then it will be on
781 2018-11-12 22:38:02 right, so emulsified oil and egg, that's why we must write. Makes sense!

At least we've solved that mystery and we can move on to how to make these sauces into serviceable prose? I'm thinking maybe pouring it over breakfast foods?
782 2018-11-12 22:37:56 @CNBCFastMoney love carter but he was wrong on oil- cramer got that right!
783 2018-11-12 22:37:49 I was pleased the voters of Washington rejected this nonsense.  I guess they don’t like higher taxes handed over to political appointees on a program that will do nothing to help climate.  I’m just bummed that big oil hasn’t cut me a check yet.
784 2018-11-12 22:37:49 Gas/oil prices are down. Don’t lie like Trump.....be better.
785 2018-11-12 22:37:43 Iraq was about Oil.  Afghanistan was about Minerals and Opium.
786 2018-11-12 22:37:36 Boy did they screw you. You sanction Iranian oil, reducing supply and increasing price, and they turn around and cut production. Played you for a fool once again.
787 2018-11-12 22:37:36 After a herbal and oil ritual bath , I'm ready for this week
788 2018-11-12 22:37:34 Thank you. 

Been beating this drum for awhile. 

Worst case scenario: we clean up our act, the earth is cleaner, and big oil drops their profits a few points.
789 2018-11-12 22:37:26 And cannibas oil is not a treatment. Don’t know where you’re getting information from     Do you even know what opioids are. Doubt it.
790 2018-11-12 22:37:16 Seems that ever since Saudi’s killed Journalist in Turkey, oil prices effected!
791 2018-11-12 22:37:04 How that murder investigation coming ? Yes, more important than oil.
792 2018-11-12 22:36:39 Doing adult things like forgetting that you need an oil change, so you change plans to get one.
793 2018-11-12 22:36:36 Your indictment, taxes and jail time will improve the stock market and price of oil #CrookedTrump . Worry about that and not about your #Narcicist impulses such as #CNN #MSNBC #AMJOY #MADDOW OR #FLORIDA elections.  #Liar #Racist #hypcrite .

796 2018-11-12 22:36:16 Watching the local news out of Harrisburg, PA; they say we can look forward to the rise in gas & oil prices again....oil was down to $59.00 or so a gallon and we never saw a break at the pumps for that. What the heck and we send it overseas to other countries! Really!

810 2018-11-12 22:35:04 Why does oil painting feel like that
811 2018-11-12 22:34:46 But that would cut the profits of the oil, coal and other big polluters who they owe their soul to.  Much more important than the welfare of the planet!
812 2018-11-12 22:34:43 Tonight’s relentless fall in $Brent oil prices releases an understanding of its seriousness in consequences and at the same time - a declaration of independence from them..

816 2018-11-12 22:34:33 Plenty of positive effects of taking fish oil!
817 2018-11-12 22:34:33 What the hell do you know about financial matters. You already have proven that you know nothing about how the economy works. If we have so much oil in our country why do we need to import oil.

821 2018-11-12 22:33:45 The only pipelines in the world being opposed are in the most environmentally progressive oil & gas producing country, why don’t you organize elsewhere? If you oppose CDA oil other less ethical producers fill the void.
822 2018-11-12 22:33:32 if you don't drink the juice out of your can of 115G SMOKE FLAVOURED MUSSELS IN CANOLA OIL then are you a true gourmand........?????
823 2018-11-12 22:33:29 Unless it’s Polyamer like the Fivers & tenners because don’t they contain palm oil which is linked to deforestation. Look at the new brexit passports though. The UK loves irony
824 2018-11-12 22:33:14 Send the troops from the southern border (you know the one to Mexico) to Saudi and force them to produce more oil.
825 2018-11-12 22:33:00 No, the EU is far from perfect but it didn’t mess up the UK, we had already done that before 1973, probably even before 18xx. The empire subsidised us up to WW2 after that we  were album broke until North Sea oil found, that’s kept us until now.
826 2018-11-12 22:32:56 Q who issues the drilling rights to the oil companies

A they have to bid & rights awarded to highest bidder
Q do oil companies also pay tax
A corporation tax (inflated) profits tax & NI for employees
827 2018-11-12 22:32:50 if nobody know, the Zionists still killing innocents in #Gaza
as a matter of fact, the people who die in Gaza are human and Arabian same like Jamal Khashoggi
you gave interest to the fate of Khashoggi because he is human, right? or because your need more oil?
#GazaUnderAttack
828 2018-11-12 22:32:41 oh he take now oil out the arktic..or he start a war with Iran ?

830 2018-11-12 22:32:21 Understandable, but knowing how to check the little things yourself is both cheaper and safer. You can top off fluids, & replacing air filter is a cheap DIY fix. You'll also know when you need to take your car to be serviced. Like when it's using too much oil. Check weekly--best

833 2018-11-12 22:31:55 Maybe you could flood the market with OUR oil and drive the prices lower???
834 2018-11-12 22:31:53 Agree, but Iceland need to stop Banking with HSBC who are big investors in the Palm Oil Business.

838 2018-11-12 22:30:58 And you’re standing with David Cameron, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Tony Blair, BAe Systems, Shell Oil, FT, Bank of America, BASF, Bayer-Monsanto, Capita...
839 2018-11-12 22:30:56 Thanks for highlighting what I said earlier- it's OPEC that produces oil, not Trump- they have much more clout than Trump
840 2018-11-12 22:30:43 No way bro! u got caught in knife dropping contest in oil as well?

843 2018-11-12 22:30:33 the mere fact people are even defending that woman and the LOA as the blanket answer "snake oil remedy" should give us a sign how to not accept any doctrine as absolute, especially from another human being.
844 2018-11-12 22:30:28 Unionists like Torcuil are sick of oil until the price falls or people lose jobs in the industry then their enthusiasm for reporting oil returns. Their mantra for all things Scotland is "good news is no news"

847 2018-11-12 22:30:10 Look at the price action of EM, Dollar, TLT, Oil and Gold between December 2015 until February 2016. This is what will happen again.
848 2018-11-12 22:29:56 That just means we should move past oil and invest in future renewable energy sources. Or is that too hard for you to understand?
849 2018-11-12 22:29:56 Yeah, thats why they are cutting production, business genius....their interest is not selling more oil, it is in boosting the long term value of the resource.  Since cutting demand is in all out interest, we support that.
850 2018-11-12 22:29:46 "I didn't have milk, so I subbed oil instead. Recipe calls for chopped carrots, but I hate vegetables. Used Twizzlers instead.  Baked at 500 for 30 minutes instead of at 375. Burnt, awful recipe. 0/10 would not recommend."
851 2018-11-12 22:29:33 Maddie suggests olive oil and seasoning (onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper) maybe some cheese and bake

855 2018-11-12 22:29:12 Still Majestically Beautiful and Dignified. Still fighting to keep oil companies out of #ANWAR. And hoping to save Salmon for our bears. Mining sucks as far as the Salmon are concerned. We just lost Prop. 1 to help them. Alaska misses you.
856 2018-11-12 22:29:03 Good keep that oil going down
857 2018-11-12 22:28:46 We may be number one in oil production but we still don't produce enough to satisfy our own demands. We now produce 11 million barrels/day but we use 20 million barrels/day. #Math
858 2018-11-12 22:28:38 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
859 2018-11-12 22:28:35 So the idea that #EU membership stops us trading elsewhere was just another #brexit lie then. Still given that 2 of the top 3 trade surpluses (developed non oil economies like our) are #eu members that was obvious.

865 2018-11-12 22:28:09 if you got a BMW the dealership giving $90 oil changes rn  
866 2018-11-12 22:28:07 Oil is overly beat down, RSI daily proves this. It's becoming more obvious that @realDonaldTrump is desperate for lower inflation numbers. A silly attempt to prevent higher interest rates heading into 2020. This is why you don't ride and die on the stock market! @GlobalProTrader
867 2018-11-12 22:28:07 It was neither presumptuous or rude, it was sarcasm. Your right to defend Sean is the same as my right criticize. He calls the people who have provided him the info on security snake oil salesmen at the same time he’s sending out misinformation on security. That’s hypocritical.

The government and wealthy companies don’t want to admit the truth about the damage we are causing our rainforests and planet by farming palm oil because they will loose money! HELP!? X
870 2018-11-12 22:27:54 I go through so much lavender oil it’s not even funny 
871 2018-11-12 22:27:46 If we used CLEAN ENERGY here in the United States, We wouldn't have to rely on foreign oil so much but then your super rich friends would get mad at YOU. 
You said you would FIX this!  Another LIE?
872 2018-11-12 22:27:21 All the while the Americans are making a lot of money buying Canadian oil at a discount and reselling it world prices!

877 2018-11-12 22:27:03 Forget about oil. You need to fire that Federal Reserve guy. Dow down 600 points. Off 1000 points from the highs. He making you look like a dickwad. Common snow flake. Who’s the boss? You’re the boss.

880 2018-11-12 22:26:40 Mr President D/T How is oil price determined? This is the correct question you need to ask your advisors your advisors misleading you .
881 2018-11-12 22:26:39 Phoenix tears isn't a strain. Just the method/thing Rick Simpson had started years ago. It's been tweaked a fair bit. I've been using this type of oil since my second chemo. High THC. It's what's needed alongside CBD to get the full theraputic effects. 
Your on the right path!
882 2018-11-12 22:26:34 Don't overdose your cat on fish oil. Just saying.
883 2018-11-12 22:26:23 .@realdonaldtrump  When the price of oil went up the economy went up, if the price of oil goes down the economy will slow down and the market will slowly drop into a recession and people will be laid off and unemployment will rise.
884 2018-11-12 22:26:12 Good for her. Both my daughters can do this. Just hope she disposed of used oil properly
885 2018-11-12 22:26:02 Much in the same way that you and your kids have no idea about how to calculate simple interest...let alone having an understanding of how financial markets, central banks, or oil reserves work...you dont know what you are talking about, as usual..hush please!!!
886 2018-11-12 22:25:41 كيف نتاكد من المصداقيه
887 2018-11-12 22:25:38 Because they want the gas prices to rise domestically so that they can afford to produce domestic oil.
888 2018-11-12 22:25:31 I literally love when my boyfriends hands are dirty from some good ole manual labor, then he smells like cologne, oil and outdoors! Omfg

mom: cool
891 2018-11-12 22:25:20 Supposed to be cuddling , but draco needed a oil change .
892 2018-11-12 22:25:18 Where is the Caravan at?  Qhen are we going to be invaded?  How much oil and gas was used to take the troops to the border?  You have not said one word about that.  You just lost in Arizona.  Blue wave
893 2018-11-12 22:25:08 By the time you price oil and a filter, labor is not that bad. That being said, I don't know what it cost to get oil changed elsewhere so I have no comparison.
894 2018-11-12 22:25:05 Cadbury also use Palm Oil in their products , an ingredient responsible for huge destruction on our planet , some animals will become #extinct  because of this and other  greedy companies.

897 2018-11-12 22:24:40 We recently changed to Epic from 3 (!!!) separate EHRs: 1 to order/review labs/films; 1 to review labs/better rads support; 1 for outpt notes/labs orders.  They talked to each other as well as oil & water.  At least I could leave them behind on "vacation"
898 2018-11-12 22:24:34 @POTUS @OPECnews ideally, minimum floor price for Brent crude oil shall be $ 75/bbl n for WTI Crude $ 65/bbl. These prices must be fixed for min 4 months validity n can be reviewed n revised up or downwards every 3 months.
899 2018-11-12 22:24:28 But I did have oily skin and this helped keep the oil down and the lotion kept my face from drying out too much
900 2018-11-12 22:24:27 Idk if I’m late to knowing this or not but to other plant mamas, my plants love to sit by the diffuser/humidifier with citrus or eucalyptus oil coming out. Idk but it makes them dance.
901 2018-11-12 22:24:25 nice and they have body butter/scrub/oil/etc 
the ones that smell most OCEANY is theres actually a line called WATER and its almost scent-less but with a liiiiittle bit of sea salt kind of vibe and i love it actually its super refreshing feeling + also has a really good scrub
902 2018-11-12 22:24:19 Learning from history since then,we can add "unless what makes people come alive is killing people to steal resources& exert influence/gain personal profit"
eg,US #Soldiers(mercenaries)who fought in order to steal #oil on behalf of big corporations(Iraq),threatening Venezuela etc
903 2018-11-12 22:24:18 As soon as my oil light come on I’m at the dealership. I hate things on my dashboard 
904 2018-11-12 22:24:15 Simple analysis you are dealing darling.why can't you come out open and support who ever you want to support and stop this usual rhetorics of I supported him in 2015 and now I won't. I gave you figure when the oil price was average BTW $100 during heroes reign and know projects.
905 2018-11-12 22:24:13 @DrJoeAbah and @segalink are some of the people that I follow religiously on twitter for one main reason among others;

I found out that I'm now smarter and better informed about various issues than I used to be.

More Grace, oil and stew to you guys in abundance.
906 2018-11-12 22:24:08 You in oil field or what? I’m in Houston for now
907 2018-11-12 22:24:02 LOL she's a do-nothing carpetbagger whose only interest is helping Republicans assist oil and gas with exploiting Wyoming's natural resources. Now that the GOP is out of power, look for her to get bored very quickly with this gig.
908 2018-11-12 22:24:00 I could eat bread, olive oil and balsamic every day

ALSO A LITTLE BIT FOR ME
914 2018-11-12 22:23:23 Is there supply manipulation between Trump and Saudis on oil? It seems he has been protecting them ever since Khashoggi was murdered, and I would not be surprised to see Trump get the Saudis to manipulate oil supply because he lost the election. More Putin's discord, by Trump.
915 2018-11-12 22:23:20 I thought there was an emergency dentist on call in Lincoln? Failing that make some clove oil, then apply the oil to gum where the pain is.
916 2018-11-12 22:23:19 Most especially oil that has bn used in frying plantain...
917 2018-11-12 22:23:10 Argentina, Italy, Japan, Turkey, all have currency issues.
The G20 should be interesting.
Argentina has a ton of undeveloped "heavy oil" that might save their currency and spark a latin american oil boom - only if IMO 2020 rules are enforced. Trump might try to delay imo 2020
918 2018-11-12 22:23:04 I’m craving olive oil
919 2018-11-12 22:23:02 read what you just wrote and ask the rest of Canada and the world if they like cheaper gas and oil prices
920 2018-11-12 22:22:55 ok
the eastern coast of california is just 530 miles long
we have oil pipes that under the ground that cover more distance than that
so if you ran a pipeline out of the gulf of california up the eastern coast and installed a way to atomize the water into mist and let the esterly
921 2018-11-12 22:22:49 Nothing with fragrance. This will sound nuts, but as someone who did cosmetics formulas, just a little olive oil, or if you have some sustainable palm oil, or honestly, a dab of crisco.
922 2018-11-12 22:22:28 @realDonaldTrump Oil prices should be lower based on supply???? What the hell does that mean? Stop tweeting and do the job you were hired to do.
923 2018-11-12 22:22:27 It still bamboozles me how so many Americans (some of my friends included), continue to fall for @realDonaldTrump and his snake oil nonsense. Has someone put something in the water? What does he have to do, or not do until they see through his con?
924 2018-11-12 22:22:19 Sitting here waiting for my oil to be changed is so annoying

927 2018-11-12 22:22:10 OPEC should follow the strategy to lower for longer and put the oil price at the market price in balance with price of all other source of energy.
928 2018-11-12 22:22:08 Saudi Arabia is just laughing at you. They lure a US resident to their embassy in Turkey to murder him and grind him up into pieces...You do nothing. Once they realize you won’t do anything, they announce they are cutting oil production to drive up prices. You are a joke.
929 2018-11-12 22:22:07 I put the oil in the dryer bruh
930 2018-11-12 22:22:01 But if banning palm oil isn’t the answer, why are you bothered by that Ethical Consumer report?
931 2018-11-12 22:21:48 It'd take more than oil money and drugs to get that bag of shit  you support going
932 2018-11-12 22:21:46 Oil paint ! I go over all the materials , and process on my patreon :)
933 2018-11-12 22:21:42 I do! Put shredded brussel sprouts on a baking sheet, sprinkle dried cranberries and walnuts over top, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, add salt and pepper to taste. Use fingers to mix all together and spread out over pan. Roast in oven at 375 until tender.
934 2018-11-12 22:21:41 I had tights, a “chop and drop” chopping board and an electric toothbrush on mine. May put garlic oil on now...
935 2018-11-12 22:21:40 Dip the padlock in a mixture of red oil and kero.
936 2018-11-12 22:21:38 Then why are our retail prices still so high?  Big profits for big oil while the middle class suffers.

946 2018-11-12 22:20:46 Aren't you worried they are stuffing butchered journalists into those barrels of oil?
947 2018-11-12 22:20:46 hot oil treatment and deep conditioning treatment got my hair feeling so soft. 
948 2018-11-12 22:20:41 $XOM probably has 10 times more PhD than Tesla. Of course, he is Elon，a smart Jewish kid, that beats all PhDs in oil industry combined.
949 2018-11-12 22:20:31 Oh wow . Now the question is are they palm oil free?
950 2018-11-12 22:20:12 Don't you smell a deal here? Saudi won't cut oil production if you look the other way on Khashoggi murder.

953 2018-11-12 22:20:00 So where was this uproar 8 or 9 years ago? Every victory is caveated with a dig about human rights and oil money. Like no other clubs has links to the Gulf State, has a morally bankrupt owner or benefits from underhanded tactics.
954 2018-11-12 22:19:49 Walker you joined for money and you know Man City is way smaller than Man United in every where. Enjoy the oil money.

956 2018-11-12 22:19:41 Bought UWT 3x oil ETF 22.35 avg. Oversold on pretty much all timeframes,  but it could go a little lower before a decent bounce gets going.  Keeping money on the sideline to average down of it gets nasty.  Looking for #spy to bounce around $270 to try for inverse h&s!
957 2018-11-12 22:19:19 How is this jack’s fault, he left the company in 2001. After he left they sold off the profitable finance arm, NBCUniversal, and a number of other profitable businesses and then they went all in on oil with the Baker Hughes merger, which is what is dragging the company down now.
958 2018-11-12 22:19:15 I hate the smell of tea tree oil and I really put this mask on my face like I was gonna love it

960 2018-11-12 22:19:05 Another reason Alberta’s Gay friendly oil must be sold on the world market price. AB’a Gay friendly oil will displace dictator oil from regimes that toss  off buildings.   The world needs more Canada.
961 2018-11-12 22:19:02 If only there was some sort of person who had the actual power to do something about this like pass a palm oil tax. Perhaps a person in government with a job title that would make this their purview.

But until such a wondrous day, keep on tweeting Mike! It's all you can do

964 2018-11-12 22:18:38 #fakenews again.  Market plunged in October.  oil is now plunging as reality hits.
965 2018-11-12 22:18:38 It was on my local TV today (may not be AMRN results), Fish Oil, Vitamin D and Placebo have no meaningful impacts on humans, when it comes to cancers and hearts.
966 2018-11-12 22:18:35 This is a fantastic commercial! To everyone who loves Nutella...they are stripping our precious rain forests for palm oil. Without these forests...we lose our oxygen. Please, check your ingredients and boycott Nutella!
967 2018-11-12 22:18:33 This one is a “234” ... to see how oil market reacts
968 2018-11-12 22:18:24 Ima get up with ya I need a pen and oil @Chan_Staccz
969 2018-11-12 22:18:18 Your vision has rewarded the wealthy and corporation and taken away from the middle class and poor. have you looked at gas and oil prices, utility costs, food prices, credit card interest rates or home and rental costs?
970 2018-11-12 22:18:18 @Arthurvw1986 have you seen this  anything with palm oil in our house is about to visit the bin
971 2018-11-12 22:18:15 They should try a tax on fast food crap cooked in oil that’s been used several times over first. This had better be one of those ideas they  research and then it comes to nothing concrete...
972 2018-11-12 22:18:13 Mood: diffusing eucalyptus oil and deep breathing over the diffuser in hopes it will calm me down.
973 2018-11-12 22:18:08 Funny how the "great deal maker" isn't saying anything about talking with the Saudis to see if he can persuade them not to cut oil production. I guess he knows there is nothing he can say. It's a done deal already. As the President of the United States, Trump is pretty worthless.
974 2018-11-12 22:17:59 some saying global demand bringing oil prices down. I say, it’s president who bring it down from $80 to $59. happy to pay less at pump (christmas gift)
975 2018-11-12 22:17:59 Someone told me the other day that she only uses rose oil in the shower. That’s it! She got snippy with me when I asked about using a cleanser because...she’s not cleaning her skin.
976 2018-11-12 22:17:52 My heart goes out to people who work 70 or more hours in the oil feild
977 2018-11-12 22:17:47 This is when we need to know if he holds stock in, for example, Standard Oil. And so long as his finances are opaque, it is fair to wonder.
978 2018-11-12 22:17:44 Oil will rally on DXY weakness.
979 2018-11-12 22:17:42 Wow a whole webpage dedicated to selling snake oil!!! 
You really showed me, lol.
980 2018-11-12 22:17:41 Why we depending on oprick for our oil. When we have plenty of our own.
#trumpnumbnuts
981 2018-11-12 22:17:31 Il y a une corelation entre cac 40 et oil me semble t il ...
982 2018-11-12 22:17:29 Chef Louis cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with gravy.
983 2018-11-12 22:17:23 There is no reason. Just people are stupid. How much you charge for a oil change tho? Lol

985 2018-11-12 22:17:19 Maybe we can push alternative sources of energy for a healthier environment and to reduce our need of foreign oil. 

Create American jobs in renewable energy.
986 2018-11-12 22:17:02 In case you're wondering why Hamas is focusing its attacks on #Ashkelon: 1) it’s a close target that is relatively heavily populated, and 2) if they continue to aim north, they might be able to hit Israeli oil refineries and power plants. #Gaza
987 2018-11-12 22:16:54 yes. i believe the box calls for water, oil, two eggs, so i was gonna use milk, oil, and 3 eggs.
988 2018-11-12 22:16:54 Drenched my hair in coconut oil but now I cba to wash it out 
989 2018-11-12 22:16:50 Oil *should* be a thing of the past or at least not the only source of energy we want to explore. The sooner we rip off that band aid the sooner we can stop justifying oil paid for in blood.
990 2018-11-12 22:16:48 Thanks tons kind sir. Certainly feels very "heavy" up here on the USD but as with oil earlier this year, I agree this could grind higher. Hoping that we are already at the peak though.
991 2018-11-12 22:16:34 Remember not only the US Embassy is on that street.... Forte Oil, T Y Danjuma and some wealthy Nigerians own property there... 

Where exactly are you driving at...

Well I worked on a property there and was allowed parking for free right in front of the property
992 2018-11-12 22:16:32 probably stems from understanding republicans are a lost cause and we desperately need more from Democrats than toothless performative theater like Paris or claiming "we believe the science" while simultaneously spreading fracking and ramping our crude oil production way up?
993 2018-11-12 22:16:23  I been sleep all day , that oil been on my ass since lastnight 
994 2018-11-12 22:16:18 Check your Transmission oil today.
995 2018-11-12 22:16:08 I laughed and then was like “my mom can’t be here she accidentally fell out of the oil pit when getting her oil changed for her car and cracked her ribs”
996 2018-11-12 22:16:05 field sales rep for what industry?
997 2018-11-12 22:16:05 This country was built on the backs of hard working men and women... not video games. But you will figure that out when you grow up.
998 2018-11-12 22:16:01 Defense Soap has tea tree oil in it. Tea tree oil is anti-fungal, anti-bacterial & anti-viral. STDs are nasty bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
999 2018-11-12 22:15:57 They don’t give a shit where their palm oil comes from as far as I’m aware wouldn’t touch their crap with a 10 foot pole!

1002 2018-11-12 22:15:42 100% correct, fernandinho was at the whole game, but don't forget that the pretty boy pep was at before the game regarding the referee, no doubt the oil backed human rights abusers city will have paid the FA off. Time to get even with the dark art club.

1011 2018-11-12 22:14:56 So we all need to be prepared to make sacrifices, including on arms and oil deals: walk the walk, not just talk the talk. #Saudi #Yemen #Khashoggi #FreeRaif #bbcnewsten

1013 2018-11-12 22:14:39 Why did they pull back from support though?

Are they concerned about the candidates former ties Exxon and the oil industry? 

The opposition wants to be heard, so maybe they want to talk to a few impartial mediators or peace makers?
1014 2018-11-12 22:14:32 Normal charge for a BODY/FACIAL peels treatment at a derma clinic is 5000.00 up!!!!

1016 2018-11-12 22:14:26 My 401k says it's because of your economic policies. Tariffs are tanking economics for ag, but not for oil? Funny how that goes
1017 2018-11-12 22:14:26 When chef claims: "Our focus is seasonal and local. Case in point: the upcoming St. Louis Salad, a mix of burrata, shrimp, octopus, chorizo and veggies with a black olive vinaigrette and lemon oil"....well olives are in season I guess. #chefsnark Another example might be helpful
1018 2018-11-12 22:14:23 Americans want our oil left in the ground until such time as they need it
Americans have the muscle to make sure that happens
The best we can hope for is oil independence
Consider, whats worse than running out of oil?
Being the last guy to have oil when everybody else has run out
1019 2018-11-12 22:14:21 You are worried they will be cutting oil production while ignoring they are cutting up reporters and massacring civilians in Yemen with American weapons . Easy to see where your priorities are .
1020 2018-11-12 22:14:15 Oh ... I see. You just lost a few notches of credibility on any topic about the snake oil sales that is religion since you are a snake oil peddler.  Got it.
1021 2018-11-12 22:14:14 Dari dulu gue gatau bio oil tuh buat apa sih? :")
1022 2018-11-12 22:14:04 Its oil prices, genius!
1023 2018-11-12 22:14:01 .@realDonaldTrump  Not surprising fake president of America slams our oil companies, suggesting the price of oil should go down. You'll never hear him say the rent on low rent housing should be cheaper since interest rates are cheap; rent just went up, right Hannity and /Carson?
1024 2018-11-12 22:13:46 That's a watercolor portrait of Bolsonaro, or an oil or acrylic painting? And what is the context? Thanks.

1026 2018-11-12 22:13:37 The difference is night and day. They are like coke to fanta or oil to water. . They don't mix
1027 2018-11-12 22:13:34 It’s all about oil profits.
1028 2018-11-12 22:13:33 Or perhaps the Democratic Party needs to rebuild infrastructure to compete with the oil and gas lobbies that have dominated the conversation and allowed people like you to slant the conversation while pretending to care about rural concerns 1/2
1029 2018-11-12 22:13:32 Wow. Who would think oil companies are greedy. We produce more oil than any country in the world. OPEC should not control us. Oh, that’s right. Saudies can do anything they want.
1030 2018-11-12 22:13:31 ICYMI The brutal selling in the stock market has resumed, and oil markets are following suit. Aung San Suu Kyi breaks do…
1031 2018-11-12 22:13:12 I think he is. I’ve been giving him warm baths and a spritz of olive oil.
1032 2018-11-12 22:13:05 @POTUS if crude oil prices falls, it won't be viable for US Shale companies to pump oil n production would be reduced. So kindly think of announcing a floor price below wch crude oil can't be sold. This way there can be some stability in price n also sufficient production.
1033 2018-11-12 22:13:04 #Alberta oil has been systematically shutting down for years with the help of foreign funds . Harpers Government did nothing to inform Albertans and lead an offensive. What is Kenny going to do different now as premier that he couldn’thave done as a #CPC cabinet minister?
1034 2018-11-12 22:12:59 @POTUS “oil prices should be lower based on supply.” Meaning well supplied market.  Yet OPEC shouldn’t cut? They are over supplying. That’s our asshat in chief economic logic.  

Just gave them license to cut dramatically.  Hard to debate someone this much a “stable genius”
1035 2018-11-12 22:12:57 Oil prices should have never risen, but someone had to have an excuse to rip the American public off for the past roughly 20 years.
1036 2018-11-12 22:12:53 Tonight on the #menu is Vietnamese style pork po boys. Pork spring rolls and boc choy tossed in oil and garlic. Pics later
1037 2018-11-12 22:12:51 Oh dear! I seen the capsules as well but they we 2.5x the price so wanted to trial the oil first & see if any change with it. Thankfully the cats can't open the dropper bottle 
1038 2018-11-12 22:12:38 If the Saudis and OPEC want to lose market share to the US then so be it. Market share of the oil space is more important than anything else.

1042 2018-11-12 22:12:07 Trump take to the American oil companies we put out the most oil on the planet besides trump you are the one putting sanctions on Iran.that will really put oil prices thru the roof.sad you don't know what your doing.
1043 2018-11-12 22:12:05 Obama better than halved the unemployment rate from 9.9% in 2009 to 4.7% in '16.

Trump hasn't even come close to that. 

He's running the ball in from the one and yelling, "I won!".

But Trump is talking about oil prices. Please try and stay on task.
1044 2018-11-12 22:11:54 Yes he said that.
It's in is autobiograph book...
Sadly, he owns AMERICA. Literally his finger and pon players are in every aspect of human life-mostly foods-commodities, oil, technology and healthcare.
1045 2018-11-12 22:11:52 I just bought a cool new shirt  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1046 2018-11-12 22:11:50 Rockefeller’s standard oil was  broken up long ago for the same thing
1047 2018-11-12 22:11:37 Right, how do you build renewable infrastructure without oil? Plastics has done more for reducing climate change than you may expect. We need oil, but should move away from using it as our main energy source.
1048 2018-11-12 22:11:37 See?  You have no business even mentioning their names. You aren’t in business. You are in government and you need to butt the hell out or refer it to your labor dept. so if the Saudis screw us on oil, shut up about it. You screw over people every damn day and govern no one.

1050 2018-11-12 22:10:57 I mean I wear a braid on top a lot of the time and that takes some of the layers out and helps the rest to look better. Alternatively also a tiny ponytail. What could also help is hair oil for the tips/some lightweight  styling product during its wet phase so it poofs up less

1056 2018-11-12 22:10:26 So #amarin basically gave their patients mineral oil as placebo to make #vascepa look better near it? they endangered people for company's financial benefit? #pharmafraud
1057 2018-11-12 22:10:26 The best essential oils I've used for cough is Peppermint,  or Euctalyptus oil. I rub coconut oil or lotion on my hand put 1-4 drops of these oils on top of that, rub hands together and put it on chest. Or Diffusing essential oils helps too! Hope you feel better soon!
1058 2018-11-12 22:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this November? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

1060 2018-11-12 22:10:07 Lol sure... that's why neither you nor apparently Charles know how oil prices work... specifically Canadian prices.
1061 2018-11-12 22:10:07 It is funny how Q is putting you punits out of business. If I was you I would call it Snake oil to. Bad part for you is you will now sell only about half as books. Now that you shit on half your base. (maybe more) #MAGA #QAnon #Trump

1066 2018-11-12 22:09:56 How about we decrease and phase out foreign oil?!?
1067 2018-11-12 22:09:51 You do know that the USA leads the world in oil production and prices only rise due to your inferior world policy and inability to manage situations at home right?
1068 2018-11-12 22:09:50 I’m surprised there isn’t a bioengineered algae way to produce a palm/canola oil equivalent product. Grow them in tubes in the desert and leave the rain forests alone

1072 2018-11-12 22:09:14 I'd love for some oil bear input, but besides the fact that oil prices at $85 Brent in EM currencies could destroy demand, where does anyone see demand destruction. Especially after prices have declines 20%+. I get it - market is anticipating weakness with higher FED rates...

1078 2018-11-12 22:08:12 Lol Adler inform yourself on how oil prices work. You have 0 credibility when you talk about anything Trump related.
1079 2018-11-12 22:08:11 @realDonaldTrump  Hello sir I agree with you but must put pressure on oil sellers because they know that there will be an energy transaction that will tip the petrol market
1080 2018-11-12 22:08:09 My excellent cold continues. Turned to Olbas oil but don't have any handkerchiefs so I've put some on an old sock and now I've called it Olbas Soxley and imagined it's writing menthol scented, distopian sci-fi novels and oh god is this a fever now

1093 2018-11-12 22:06:16 CBD oil is actually very good for a number of things including sleep and inflammation. Plenty of research to back it up, too. Even without thc, it activates cannabinoid receptors. That being said, I’ll take a placebo any day- results with no side effects =

HOW much buttered coffee were you drinking!? Good lord
1097 2018-11-12 22:05:51 @IcelandFoods @itvthismorning after seeing the ad my 10yr old burst into tears - shocked and angry.  She will raise awareness at her school and quit her beloved Nutella or anything containing palm oil. THANK YOU. May other retail giants quickly follow you #Rangtan #PalmOilFree
1098 2018-11-12 22:05:49 Saudi’s said they would flood the market. The drop is the price we pay for an oil based economy. Evolve or perish.
1099 2018-11-12 22:05:47 As a swing producer, Saudi Arabia should use its spare production capacity to meet oil shortages and not to drive prices down. Let the markets decide oil prices.
1100 2018-11-12 22:05:38 Don't get that cigar too close to that oil slick on your head ... it could be dangerous.
1101 2018-11-12 22:05:29 I give major props to Hispanic moms who fry eggs and are first line defense against the oil popping
1102 2018-11-12 22:05:18 I feel ur stoner pain. Cardio clears my lungs out and stopped infections from happening but when I switched to a vape for leaves n oil my lungs really felt new again.
1103 2018-11-12 22:05:14 Ahh I love sesame oil so that will definitely go down well. There’s something about a portobello that I just can’t get on board with. I think it’s the texture
1104 2018-11-12 22:05:06 Once again, your alarmist rhetoric is disgusting. What's more, if Canada didn't sell our oil, the world would get it from somewhere else. We have the highest environmental standards in the world. Stop being such a hypocrite.
1105 2018-11-12 22:05:01 It has to be a not too specific, but not too broad subject to do with oil and gas.
1106 2018-11-12 22:05:00 get an ice cream cone, splash in the puddles while they change your oil 
1107 2018-11-12 22:04:56 Ommmgggg I thought an oil change was 40 bucks lmao
1108 2018-11-12 22:04:55 rick simpson oil is that girl
1109 2018-11-12 22:04:54 It's only oil tho cmon, that's environmental
1110 2018-11-12 22:04:52 If you took time off from Tweeting you would notice oil prices have dropped for the 11th straight day. Looks like the economy is coming to a holt
1111 2018-11-12 22:04:50 Crude oil prices are the lowest they have been in almost a year. OPEC is trying to drive American petroleum companies out of business.
1112 2018-11-12 22:04:42 CBD oil is an amazing thing! Glad it helped you!
1113 2018-11-12 22:04:39 Shell oil
1114 2018-11-12 22:04:37 Oil pen??? Lmao okay
1115 2018-11-12 22:04:26 Did you see Whoopi having to swallow her words as if she was swallowing caster oil?!That made my day seeing that lol
1116 2018-11-12 22:04:24 1/ I'm not surprised at the tech swoon. I've been calling for it for a year or so. I am surprised that oil did not play a catalyst, however. My thesis had the DXY (due to stupid late cycle stimulus) and oil (due to RUKSA+ cuts) working in tandem to create the fwd growth collapse.
1117 2018-11-12 22:04:22 See idk because I only used it on my vagina and crack lol made sure to not get ANY soap on the inside and then moisturized with grape seed oil
1118 2018-11-12 22:04:12 castor oil

1120 2018-11-12 22:03:59 Please explain why a TV celebrity/real estate salesman is commenting on world oil prices.
1121 2018-11-12 22:03:48 Can I pop ten fish oil pills from Sam's Club instead?
1122 2018-11-12 22:03:36 I love argon oil
1123 2018-11-12 22:03:32 Lavendar Oil mixed with a carrier, I applied to an arthritic joint @2 am ... pain gone in 5, 11 hrs later like it never happened. 2015 Study compared it to taking a tramadol pain killer!!! 
1124 2018-11-12 22:03:30 We have plenty of oil in reserve and produce enough for our consumption. Who cares what Saudi Arabia does cap the fucking leak off the coast of Louisiana!
1125 2018-11-12 22:03:21 I needed a funnel to pour oil into my car the other day. Went through my recycling bin. Found zero plastic bottles I could use. Had to improvise and roll up paper.
I clearly don't drink enough bottled drinks.
1126 2018-11-12 22:03:19 I’m pretty sure the oil and gas industry aren’t worried. Just impatient.
1127 2018-11-12 22:03:11 I’ve worked every holiday for the past 15 years (except Christmas Day) because in my industry they are like any other day; but the trade off is I have a level of job security and enough of a resume I turn down job offers almost monthly.
1128 2018-11-12 22:03:08 Kapag oil price rollback, dahil sa world market.
Kapag oil price hike, dahil kay Duterte.

#galawangdilawan
1129 2018-11-12 22:03:03 I accidentally dropped and BROKE a bottle of lube and I don't know how to get rid of the rest??? GOOGLE ONLY GIVES ME SOLUTIONS FOR ENGINE OIL send help!!
1130 2018-11-12 22:03:00 I always check if products contain palm oil and if they do I refuse to buy them
1131 2018-11-12 22:02:55 Put some coconut oil on them babies heads, it works for everything!
1132 2018-11-12 22:02:36 We don’t need Saudi Arabia oil we have plenty of our own let’s start drilling hugely America first.

1134 2018-11-12 22:02:24 You doing a full service on your car, including oil change and brake filters. And then the bonnet closes on your head.
1135 2018-11-12 22:02:18 It's their oil, they can charge what they want.  Maybe it's time to look into bigger production of SOLAR POWER & ELECTRIC CARS.
1136 2018-11-12 22:02:15 Fruit and vegetables and chicken are purely scottish. Not only do we have oil but we are the world's bread basket... , if this does not convince you to vote Yes next time, heaven help you....
1137 2018-11-12 22:02:12 Tonight at 5pm ONLY ON @NBC2 police body cam footage showing the moments officers bust a teen for smuggling cannabis oil inside Cape Coral High in a vape pen.
1138 2018-11-12 22:02:02 In 2013, half of what the government earned was committed to salaries; by 2017, that number was 70%. And of course, as global crude oil prices rise, Nigeria spends more and more on wasteful fuel subsidies.

1139 2018-11-12 22:01:55 The best investment of mine was cotton scented essential oil. BECAUSE DAMN DOES MY NASTY COUCH SMELL GOOD NOW.
1140 2018-11-12 22:01:35 You want wet looking skin? Natural vitamin E oil (it also helps with skin protecting, hydration and softening)
1141 2018-11-12 22:01:35 Didn't know that. I feel the sponge scrapes out all the dirt and oil in the skin. I barely have any bumps on my face
1142 2018-11-12 22:01:29 おはよ～
1143 2018-11-12 22:01:12 Pay more than our fair share and I'm not for that. I believe the things that the government does regulate like oil and what not are being price gouged and again screwing us over. I just want government completely out of my life and treating us fairly and I don't think that has
1144 2018-11-12 22:01:06 PSA @HaloTopCreamery birthday cake and cinnamon swirl flavour have palm oil in them  the only two and the two I managed to buy 
1145 2018-11-12 22:01:02 Hard to face the truth sometimes. United supporters been trying to get ANY Chelsea rent boys to admit their success is from crooked oil oligarch money; it's like arguing with a stop sign.

1148 2018-11-12 22:00:44 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this November? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1149 2018-11-12 22:00:36 As long as the Trump regime is willing to ignore Saudi Arabia’s slaying of a journalist,they will not withhold their oil.
1150 2018-11-12 22:00:31 November 12, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1151 2018-11-12 22:00:30 homemade random-veggie pakora.

1 cup chopped onion.
2 cups chopped collard greens (frozen whole then chopped on use)
A bunch of random spices.
And 1 cup thick batter made from rice and chickpea flour 50/50 mix dry.

Mix in a large bowl until coated.
Fry in oil 4 min each side

all natural products NO HARMFUL CHEMICALS IN ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. I'm LOVING THIS!!! 
1158 2018-11-12 21:59:56 When the "crude oil" has permeated the thought of the rulers-what do you expect?
1159 2018-11-12 21:59:50 @joerogan Can you tell me the brand of CBD oil or balm you use or suggest? Thanks, pain from lifetime of police work, ugh.

1161 2018-11-12 21:59:40 Eucalyptus oil going in rn
1162 2018-11-12 21:59:31 I think it is educational most people don’t know about palm oil. All I’ve read on twitter today is about banning this and banning that what’s wrong with the world??
1163 2018-11-12 21:59:16 But CO2 is the only “pollution” these clowns know. The only industry they protest is the Canadian oil industry.  Pawns, all of them.
1164 2018-11-12 21:59:13 Why does @realDonaldTrump want lower oil prices? Already in bear mkt. It hurts American oil/gas companies and the stock mkt in general.
1165 2018-11-12 21:59:07 Very clearly Saudi Crown Prince is behind this death! Niw he is brebing west world with oil money! Shame
1166 2018-11-12 21:58:59 It's called Palm oil! Ruins the taste and more importantly ruins the planet! But it's illegal for companies to advertise that fact!
1167 2018-11-12 21:58:45 did you just call it an "oil pen" OMFG
1168 2018-11-12 21:58:45 What I need in my life rn:

Apple cider vinegar
Pure tea-tree oil
Almond oil
Rose water
Shoes
Job
Phone
Money

1169 2018-11-12 21:58:40 Translation,  if I'm forced to act on Khashoggis murder,  like the rest of the Democratic leaders of the world are planning , SA will hit me with a huge increase $ per oil barrel & ( most importantly ) will spike my my loans interest rates.
1170 2018-11-12 21:58:28 What a typical small mind tweet....facts and liberals are like oil and water....I learned long ago, liberals are impervious to truth....SO why argue! Go get some psychtrophic drugs...learn to cope...#KAG2020
1171 2018-11-12 21:58:25 Whatever happened to all that domestic oil?
1172 2018-11-12 21:58:24 Thanks Donald merry christmas. With lower oil prices. All over the world. Gracias
1173 2018-11-12 21:58:11 7 billion for fish oil. Yeah yeah prime fish oil. Millions will be on it. No bubble here. Move on
1174 2018-11-12 21:58:08 It is grass fed butter and MCT oil, which is like brain octane oil. Apparently is has a lot of great benefits. You should research it!!
1175 2018-11-12 21:58:05 FOUND HINOKI OIL
1176 2018-11-12 21:58:04 You Can Only Tell A Blind Man, 
There's No Oil In The Soup, 
Than There's No Salt In The Soup. 
You Don't Need The Mirrow To See The Bangue 
1177 2018-11-12 21:57:58 We should be reducing our reliance on oil. My God, man, when are you going to get a clue!?
1178 2018-11-12 21:57:48 The US is now the largest crude exporter in the world. We should be able to control our own oil prices and stop purchasing crude from the Middle East.
1179 2018-11-12 21:57:15 Your the headache causing the stock markets to rumble by giving sh!t to France!

Oh yeah, you would have forgotten that already cos your busy with oil prices I see.
1180 2018-11-12 21:57:14 Oil 
1181 2018-11-12 21:57:08 exactly, and also banning palm oil is a really bad idea
1182 2018-11-12 21:57:03 Is it possible to avoid palm oil? Food-wise, yes. Household products? Yes? As a consumer, I didn’t ask palm oil to be added. Is it a necessary ingredient for quality? Or just necessary for profit margins?
1183 2018-11-12 21:56:43 Probably oil... but there were certainly people dying involved, unfortunately.
1184 2018-11-12 21:56:35 They’re raising awareness of palm oil because it’s displacing orangutangs, which are now critically endangered. Cardboard boxes do not come from Borneo
1185 2018-11-12 21:56:29 I’ve got some snake oil that’ll clear that right up!
1186 2018-11-12 21:56:17 We’re like oil and water . Just don’t mix.
1187 2018-11-12 21:56:17 It's honestly kind of amazing that they just flat out say "it's oil" now
1188 2018-11-12 21:56:14 Adding protections for an imaginary crisis to " protect" special counsel who is rouge but nobody trying to remove him. 
What happens in future when we have a rouge counsel who seriously needs removing, but you cant bcse of an unnecessary law?
1189 2018-11-12 21:56:13   etc
1190 2018-11-12 21:56:07 WTP will pay $ 4 R oil. Carter tried, now step up DT!  RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil prod...
1191 2018-11-12 21:56:05 The rigs and production facilities up on AK North Slope are built for that.
None in lower 48 are.
The very best in WY ND are close, but they're rare.
1192 2018-11-12 21:56:03 So you imposed sanctions on Iran yet gave 8 countries a wavier to continue buying oil from them because you were afraid of oil prices shocking the world and in the end this was just a political ploy. Please, just resign.
1193 2018-11-12 21:55:48 You can. But it is called an olive oil cake. I am heart conscious too.
1194 2018-11-12 21:55:43 Oregano oil
1195 2018-11-12 21:55:43 @sainsburys @Tesco @asda @Ocado Iceland leading the way is banning palm oil from own brands. The larger supermarkets well off the pace and still using palm oil in their own products and huge amounts of plastic packaging. Consumers need the supermarkets to listen and make changes
1196 2018-11-12 21:55:38 ROTI: dough made with only water, baked on tawa, no oil. Can also be made in a tandoor and is then called tandoori roti. PHULKA : same as roti but put on naked flame at the end when it puffs (phulna) up. If it doesnt, it isnt a proper phulka. (source: Punjabi roots)
1197 2018-11-12 21:55:34 They are ignoring the fact that a lot of electric companies use oil.
1198 2018-11-12 21:55:33 Bruh when did these oil changes get so damn expensive sheesh ... trynna break a bitch bank
1199 2018-11-12 21:55:26 SO SELL OUR DAMN OIL...
1200 2018-11-12 21:55:22 This hoe out here telling girls to put tea tree oil on their lashes. Sis.....no.
1201 2018-11-12 21:55:17 Lemme jus go out here  IN THE COLD and change this damn oil and stop being lazy 
1202 2018-11-12 21:55:13 I lost my favourite perfume oil in Vegas or something and I’m so upset I ordered a new bottle thankgud I have cheaper taste in scents
1203 2018-11-12 21:55:00 These oil prices aren't reflecting at the pump and my wallet is furious
1204 2018-11-12 21:54:56 I’m starting to experience it in one of my hands so would also be interested in serious replies to this. I’m also wondering about Glucosamine and Argan oil to help relieve the issue.
1205 2018-11-12 21:54:54 Is this done with oil or acrylic?
1206 2018-11-12 21:54:52 WTP will pay $ 4 R oil. Carter tried, now step up DT! @realDonaldTrump
1207 2018-11-12 21:54:51 And true...
Stop buying Palm Oil products 
That’s what I say
1208 2018-11-12 21:54:47 Just took my car in for an oil change and they cleaned it inside and out too. I’m beyond happy. 
1209 2018-11-12 21:54:47 Quorn pieces fried in sesame seed oil are yum. Halloumi on top of a portobello mushroom is my fav burger swap but then I'm not a huge burger fan.
1210 2018-11-12 21:54:43 Have u seen oil prices lately?
1211 2018-11-12 21:54:42 What do we care?? I thought you said we were not depending on oil from other countries as much because we were almost oil independent??
1212 2018-11-12 21:54:40 That is nothing new! I remember during gulf war they where protesting us wanting to go after Saddam because they where doing illegal trades with them for oil! They destroyed markers and monuments!
1213 2018-11-12 21:54:26 Hey #Trump, you #Whine about Saudi Arabia but you don't say a single word about your boy #Putin closing the oil tap.
Isn't it about time you started acting, well, you know, like a Man?
1214 2018-11-12 21:54:24 Thanks for the tag @KiltieJackson 

5 things I adore non-human are:

Cake (surprise!)
Words
White noise
Tea tree oil (became mesmerized by it during pregnancy)
Bloody good coffee

Not going to tag anyone as I'm likely to duplicate.
1215 2018-11-12 21:54:21 Oil money.
1216 2018-11-12 21:54:19 did they find that post you made six years ago about brownies made with olive oil?
1217 2018-11-12 21:54:16 Money better spent...fire proof your property.  My husband is a retired fire fighter, working as a field fire supv for an oil pipeline company in AK.  They have fire proofed their pump stations in the middle of the woods.  Fires burn all around them, not one has ever caught fire.
1218 2018-11-12 21:54:14 Data is the new oil. 

But kitty litter does not, repeat NOT,  help in clean up
1219 2018-11-12 21:54:11 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production!  Marine Corps
1220 2018-11-12 21:54:04 Yes the people bought a bus load of snake oil. And people have been known to change their minds when they find they have been duped. Are you denying the people that right?
1221 2018-11-12 21:54:02 @realDonaldTrump  please sign an EO stating: All non-citizens who vote in a Federal election shall be deported immediately.

Conservatives will burn the midnight oil looking for these cheaters.
1222 2018-11-12 21:54:01 He could model for Yield signs . . . 
1223 2018-11-12 21:53:58 You want the price of oil to go down.
1224 2018-11-12 21:53:51 Girl do NOT put tea tree oil anywhere near your eyes.
1225 2018-11-12 21:53:39 Can't be Oil Sanctions against Iran, or Tariffs, or the Tax Scam...it has to be not enough positive vibes heading to Orange Julius Caesar
1226 2018-11-12 21:53:37 CHAPAATI : dough made with water and oil, roasted with oil on tawa. PLAIN PARATHA: same as chapaati, except its rolled in a circle, then folded into layers with oil in between layers and rolled again.
1227 2018-11-12 21:53:25 Step 1: maybe no more than 10 minutes in there. Step 2: bit of olive oil makes the skin nice and crispy.
1228 2018-11-12 21:53:21 Your Saudi friends are turning on you! 

Saudi Arabia calls for oil output cuts

Speaking at a conference in Abu Dhabi, Saudi energy minister Khalid Al Falih said "there will need to be a reduction of supply from October levels, approaching 1 million barrels."
1229 2018-11-12 21:53:18 TBC Oil
1230 2018-11-12 21:53:01 this hair oil is getting me RIGHT
1231 2018-11-12 21:53:01 Sound familiar? What chance do we have against oil and gas money. #auspol #climate #coalkills #csg
1232 2018-11-12 21:52:56 Short oil companies, Nasdaq and in a few time long bitcoin.
1233 2018-11-12 21:52:55 Stock market tanking & oil prices increasing, Trump’s economy is imploding!
1234 2018-11-12 21:52:55 This is going to be his achilles heel.  POTUS can't control oil prices in a free market economy like the US. Only state run oil producers have that luxury. He is toxic, but I'm going to put my faith in OPEC and a reduction in Canadian production as my catalyst for higher prices.
1235 2018-11-12 21:52:55 I can't sleep without lavender essential oil on my pillow case. It's like my comforter
1236 2018-11-12 21:52:50 Heads up on AAO, gang: We had some family obligations come up yesterday and today that set us back a few hours. We'll be burning the midnight oil finishing this one, but it might come out tomorrow morning instead of tonight.
1237 2018-11-12 21:52:45 The problem with this data is that it doesn’t capture flaring and other fugitive emissions. Subsequent research has shown that when those are addressed Cdn oil moves to the middle of the pack. Moreover, with ctax our carbon emissions per unit of production are dropping over time.
1238 2018-11-12 21:52:44 Mid Eastern countries blessed with oil & gas can postpone day of reckoning. 

Countries in region without such resources must find sustainable Eco model that can deliver on both growing the cake and dividing it to ensure their poorest citizens can meet most basic living standard
1239 2018-11-12 21:52:30 Uhhh im tryna get my oil changed & this guy aint even tell me where he left the shits
1240 2018-11-12 21:52:25 An extraordinary interview, which to put it mildly didn’t give me any confidence in the control of the fracking industry. The Director of Regulation of the Oil & Gas Industry really needs to know something about his industry.
1241 2018-11-12 21:52:10 I don't think we'll win the league, I also don't think there's any need to insult my fellow supporters if they disagree. We're up against an oil funded freakshow that will get 100+ points again while we have Moreno, Lallana & Origi on the bench.
1242 2018-11-12 21:52:09 North Vermillion football coach Brian Crabtree has been to state and won it. Tonight he tells Sports 10 how bad he wants to get this years Falcons team back to Lucas Oil Stadium and help this group experience that!
1243 2018-11-12 21:52:04 I can't imagine that there is enough used cooking oil to run power plants for more than a few minutes.
1244 2018-11-12 21:52:02 As per my last RT, are we gonna ban palm oil? 
1245 2018-11-12 21:51:59 Awesome neighbor! Brought my dozer back full of diesel, and handed me 2 gallons of oil and 5 gallons of hydraulic oil... he also replaced my negative cable and terminal end.

He can borrow it anytime! 
1246 2018-11-12 21:51:58 @caveofbeauty  if I use morning: cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, aloe Vera gel, netrogena hydro boost gel and clean and clear oil free moisturizer. 
Night: cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, aloe Vera gel, netrogena hydro boost gel and 15% glycolic acid moisturizer.
1247 2018-11-12 21:51:57 And they are no doubt selling like hot cakes. His people need their daily snake oil.
1248 2018-11-12 21:51:49 Saudi Arabia isn't cutting oil production. They're cutting journalists into pieces and then given cover by the US President.
1249 2018-11-12 21:51:42 again: 
between 1939-1941 USSR was a very loyal ally to Nazi Germany. Provided them with oil, steal, food etc. Delivered to Gestapo multiple German Communists who had taken refuge in the USSR. During this time Stalin managed to murder & deport more innocent people than Hitler.
1250 2018-11-12 21:51:37 @sainsburys whats the chances of you taking the palm oil out of your peanut butter? :)
1251 2018-11-12 21:51:28 Trump is freezing mandates that new cars use less gasoline and pollute less, and cutting limits on potent methane gas released by the oil industry. 

His disdain for the environment is enough for me to get very angry. 

Also, tariffs are idiotic re: global supply chains.
1252 2018-11-12 21:51:24 Once in that ass stay, she wants it that way. Oil gel makes it sweeter
1253 2018-11-12 21:51:13 How much of the rest is timber, and other resources?  My exposure has (admittedly) only been to the oil business up there.  I generally have a high opinion of Canadians' thoughtfulness, but they are unduly dependent on non-renewable commodities.
1254 2018-11-12 21:50:50 well, if they do, buy oil from Norway!
1255 2018-11-12 21:50:48 Tesco should follow Iceland’s TV ad and ban palm oil from all its own brand products.
1256 2018-11-12 21:50:45 She said my oil smells lovely 
1257 2018-11-12 21:50:36 うーん、今日もゴミ相場！
1258 2018-11-12 21:50:31 Bio oil ini bisa ilangin bekas jerawat gk sih:((
1259 2018-11-12 21:50:29 white cooking show chef: *adds a tsp more extra virgin olive oil to dish than needed* haha you know me. always breaking the rules around here !
1260 2018-11-12 21:50:27 I do not agree with you, Venezuela needs a high oil prize in order to give good Life quality to the people
1261 2018-11-12 21:50:27 The Egyptians built the pyramids without a single power tool, I think solution could be found without lots of oil and gas, 70% if fossil fuels are landlocked assets, we should use what carbon limits that are left to go totally renewable
1262 2018-11-12 21:50:18 Generally if it’s sustainably sourced it will say so on the product. A list of the main culprits for use of unsustainable palm oil are available via green peace and friends of the earth. They also have petitions against those companies.
1263 2018-11-12 21:50:17 I dont have an actual allergy to nuts, but if something tastes like nuts, my body rejects it and I'll vomit. Things in peanut oil doesnt bother me but if I have Nutella, get me a trash can.
1264 2018-11-12 21:50:08 You are correct,  they also forget that the Computers, smartphones, tires, television, cars, all rubber products, just about everything they touch is a oil based product.
1265 2018-11-12 21:50:08 I'm seeing friends get really defensive when I say "er, it's a bit more complicated than that; banning palm oil really isn't the answer" *sigh^
1266 2018-11-12 21:50:07 Most of the USL plays in either baseball stadiums or has horrible turf like Lucas Oil stadium. But somehow not having lights isn't meeting standards.
1267 2018-11-12 21:50:00 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1268 2018-11-12 21:49:55 Oil & Gas among the worst areas today along with semiconductors and biotech.  All done around 4-5%.

Natural gas another stellar day +4%.  Commodities & bonds also green.
1269 2018-11-12 21:49:48 Have nail polish on all the time to prevent your nails from breaking! If you don't want a noticeable colour or if you are not allowed coloured nails, just use clear nail polish.

Use nail oils if you have dry nails! I recommend jojoba oil as it's the best for your nails!
1270 2018-11-12 21:49:47 Yep, thats precisely what he wants. If OPEC cuts production it means that he can raise prices for US Oil exports and have someone to blame. This administration is all about the drill.
1271 2018-11-12 21:49:45 @elonmusk as drillers extract ever greater volumes of oil from the ground, they still are not turning a profit. “To outward appearances, the U.S. oil and gas industry is in the midst of a decade-long boom,” However, “America’s fracking boom has been a world-class bust.”
1272 2018-11-12 21:49:39 Oh, it's hot and wet and slick. And it's making everybody sick. Oil spill.
1273 2018-11-12 21:49:36 BIG PICTURE!!!! Americans are more likely to spend this Christmas Season based upon a WEALTH EFFECT ....not Saving .10 cents on a gallon of gas! Oil and Gas represent approx. 40% of the S&P 500!! Oh Yeah and the EASY TO WIN trade war...THATS Tanked the rest of the market!!!!!!!
1274 2018-11-12 21:49:29 Oh yes I have that! Maybe I’ll start diffusing the oil or using a roller to put some on me. Thanks!
1275 2018-11-12 21:49:24 What about banning palm oil in Sainsburys own brand products. Iceland has. Time SBRY’s follows suit.
1276 2018-11-12 21:49:23 Unethical due to deforestation undertaken to grow palm oil tree’s
1277 2018-11-12 21:49:14 I was referring to the DOW being down so significantly and growing for the last few weeks.. not so much oil
1278 2018-11-12 21:49:11 Nope. Nope. Nope.
1279 2018-11-12 21:49:08 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
1280 2018-11-12 21:49:08 Veterans Day is for honoring the sacrifices made by living veterans.  
Memorial Day is when we honor those who died in service to our country.
1281 2018-11-12 21:49:07 Stance on palm oil use in products??
1282 2018-11-12 21:49:01 Reality Al. Put your money into bonds. Take it out of your high flying stocks. Worse is yet to hit. Protect your wealth. Apple down. Saudi's are raising price per barrel to punish the West.Trump punishing 7 nations on Iranian oil to go into recession to buy US. We can't supply it
1283 2018-11-12 21:48:49 Shocking to realise just how many big brand products contain palm oil, that we probably buy without realising. Then you think, ‘why do they need to use it?’
Well done Iceland for making a stand, I hope others follow suit...
1284 2018-11-12 21:48:47 I’v only ever tried the oil, but I love animal shaped candy 
1285 2018-11-12 21:48:43 The billions gotta come from someone. Whether it’s a parking lot owner, a Glazer, or an oil baron. I’m amused by folks acting like they wouldn’t take the same deal if an oil baron came to buy their club

1289 2018-11-12 21:48:01 MR. PRESIDENT, THERE IS REASON IN THE WORLD THAT OIL PRICES SHOULD GO BEYUOND $60-65; ESPECIALLY WHEN ELECTRIC CARS WERE INTRODUCED FEW YEARS AGO ! THE OPEC  COUNTRIES SHOULD NO LONGER "PLAY MONOPOLY WITH OIL PRICES"! THE U.S. AND
THE FUTURE WORLD ECONOMY WILL BE BADLY EFFECTED!
1290 2018-11-12 21:47:48 The boots organix one is superb too I use the daily rosehio oil and sometimes there cleansing balm rosehio oil again but smells lovey and does the job
1291 2018-11-12 21:47:45 They leak oil like a sieve. Just saying. Our shop had to send the block of one to be line honed.
1292 2018-11-12 21:47:40 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
1293 2018-11-12 21:47:40 I visited a place in Tennessee selling oil paintings of Trump crying.
1294 2018-11-12 21:47:30 Oil is down on supply output and OPEC not looking like will cut supply + Iran oil waivers means for the time being that supply isn't going to just go away. .
1295 2018-11-12 21:47:28 THERE MAY BE OIL (donk donk donk da donk) UNDER ROCKALL
1296 2018-11-12 21:47:17 The effect of Trump's verbal intervention in the oil market will be short-lived. After a few days, Trump's tweet will be forgotten and oil prices will again be determined by the usual fundamental factors, such as the state of the world economy, demand and supply.
1297 2018-11-12 21:47:06 Sunday is good day to try your first anal experience. Get oil gel and try it
1298 2018-11-12 21:47:00 President #Trump : Don’t worry about oil price , #SaudiArabia and #OPEC are working for fare and balanced oil price . 
Since #Iran was given exemption by #USA to sale oil for 8 countries, this lead to lower production by #Saudi & #OPEC to get it balanced.
1299 2018-11-12 21:46:58 I love strawberries but hate strawberry flavoured anything! I despise coconut water, the flavour, the oil, the smell but I love coconut 
1300 2018-11-12 21:46:56 Relax everyone, this too shall pass. When? FIIK. But it will pass. The only thing that can make this continue is an entire oil complex, already too deep in debt, or out of foreign reserve cushions, to give away their oil. Not saying it can't happen, but it can't happen for long.
1301 2018-11-12 21:46:49 “Omg we need to stop fracking. We are literally destroying the Earth”

“Omg I can’t believe oil prices are going up. DARN you greedy capitalists!!!”

You can only complain about 1
1302 2018-11-12 21:46:42 My favourite pizzas when I was vegetarian were risteronte and they have barely any cheese on them, but had herb infused olive oil over the top. So I'm going to experiment with some oils.
1303 2018-11-12 21:46:36 Saudi Arabia has responsibility towards its people and will pursued oil production cut to ensure higher oil prices as long as US can not honor its promise in putting effective sanctions on Iran oil export. Saudi Arabia will not over produce oil and shoot its self at the foot !!!
1304 2018-11-12 21:46:33 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1305 2018-11-12 21:46:22 Uh, she did talk about it. What she said is that the attempt to land lock Cdn oil will mean the world get it from somewhere else. Btw, we're tired of your alarmist rhetoric. The Maldives aren't flooded, Polar bear pop's are up, Ice caps aren't melting. Go try BSing someone else
1306 2018-11-12 21:46:15 snake oil
1307 2018-11-12 21:46:15 The Iceland advert makes me so sad, it’s such a shame it’s been banned for being “too political” when really the media is just too scared to show what is truly happening and the effects of palm oil usage. They should be wanting to show it more to spread awareness if anything
1308 2018-11-12 21:46:14 Big oil and those invested in it are trying hard to bamboozle ppl
1309 2018-11-12 21:46:09 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
1310 2018-11-12 21:46:08 Trump lost the House of Representatives.
Trump lost many governorships.
Trump the Loser.

So what does he do? He lashes out. Anything in his way, gonna crush it. 

He attacks FIREFIGHTERS in California.
He attacks Saudis because they cannot meet the IRAN oil shortfall in the US.
1311 2018-11-12 21:45:57 U have bought a Yankee candle and oil hahahhahahahahahhaha peado bastard hang you from my house bye brother
1312 2018-11-12 21:45:56 True, but isn't Sugar and Oil byproducts of NATURE ?
Until it gets refined.
1313 2018-11-12 21:45:55 Oil hit with longest losing streak on record
1314 2018-11-12 21:45:54 Ohhhh apples, apricot and peaches 
Anddd I don’t use any oil, but what I do is I slice them very thin and then soak them in lemon water and then put them inside the oven 

As for the nuts, it’s almonds and walnuts and cashew

1318 2018-11-12 21:45:23 Trump doesn’t control the gas prices. The overriding factor that determines the price of oil from day to day is the market principle of supply and demand. It’s simple economics, when demand is greater than the supply, prices rise.
1319 2018-11-12 21:45:22 Man you are not very wise regarding oil prices and what will happen when they skyrocket.
1320 2018-11-12 21:45:18 Their desire is palpable; it's such a boom/bust place (and the love of winter sports is so strong) that one can understand the temptation.  But as you suggest, they must resist. More urgent question is what the city can do if the oil boom is not going to come back with full force
1321 2018-11-12 21:45:03 I live in a town where the majority work in the Oil Sands. Deaths are very uncommon. Safety standards are strict. What deaths in the oil industry?

1335 2018-11-12 21:44:07 This is the same fanbase who have been begging for their current owners to leave so that they can get oil money and become relevant again hypocrisy at its finest. Even Man U has had finachial takeovers where they've been gotten extra money to spend but we'll ignore that
1336 2018-11-12 21:44:06 i said ok me but i don’t even know what an oil pen is
1337 2018-11-12 21:44:02 Yep, get them low enough that oil companies will slow or stop exploration til the prices go back up. And its disgusting that you are cool with the Saudis killing journalists in other countries and murdering innocent people and children in Yemen. Our morals are not for sale!!
1338 2018-11-12 21:43:59 Oh, p.s., allies do not mean one world government....each is a sovereign nation. Perhaps you should take a look at Revelation, the final government is a dictatorship based on money. “Hurt not the oil and wine”. “He shall rise to power, but not of himself”.

1341 2018-11-12 21:43:39 Why do people keep assuming he has any idea what he's talking about? He believes oil should be 20.00. That's all he needs to know. Everything else is fake news just trying to prove him wrong.

1344 2018-11-12 21:43:31 My god you idiot, production has nothing to do with the price of oil, you were around during the oil crisis of the 70s, how do you not know this?!
OPEC can set the price specifically to EACH BUYER! That's a free market baby.
But, with "green energy"... This wouldn't be a problem.
1345 2018-11-12 21:43:28 Give me oil in my lamp keep me burning    is a banger 
1346 2018-11-12 21:43:27 Yeah, sure, it couldn't be because of anything that you've done, like create instability in the oil market by Iranian sanctions, and your needless and idiotic trade wars. 
1347 2018-11-12 21:43:17 And with massive rapidly rising #shale production, he is getting help from American producers.  Trump's trade war with China which has resulted in shale exports going to zero has been harmful.  Plus, his lies on Iran.  Trump is bad news for the oil market in the short term.

1352 2018-11-12 21:42:58 Hopefully Saudi Arabia won't be cutting oil production like they cut journalists. Oil prices should be much lower because I said so!

1368 2018-11-12 21:41:37 Didn’t you cut a deal with the Crown Prince to “look the other way” concerning the Washington Post journalist who was murdered by the Saudi Govt... oil prices should be rock bottom!! Or... you could just do your job and negotiate solid prices. 
Just say’n
1369 2018-11-12 21:41:33 If RUKSA+ were smart, they's slash all light oil prices into the toilet, and pump every light well they have, chokes off. Then watch shale crater when the FED raises rates and debt+interest payments exceed adj revenue. Clean-up in aisle 45.
1370 2018-11-12 21:41:33 We produce more oil than ever. Why are we exporting?
1371 2018-11-12 21:41:30 I would be neroli oil 
1372 2018-11-12 21:41:29 Greater Norway   in Russia  ... 
Yes! 
No, England! 
Yes, Russia is cold and homey. 
But England 
England is a warm southern hellhole, Russia is much better + oil and gas.
Hmm, okay... 
Greater Norway in Russia 
1373 2018-11-12 21:41:28 Sweet! If we can end oil altogether it will be a win
1374 2018-11-12 21:41:24 My daughter got into my wife's bottle of peppermint oil and now my entire house smells like the strongest candy cane ever made. Send help!
1375 2018-11-12 21:41:12 All kind of neat stuff happens when it gets cold. Wet (natural) gas starts freezing, relays stop working. It’s an absolute blast
1376 2018-11-12 21:41:09 Go ahead and let OPEC cut oil production... Then @POTUS can $ell oil from the USA to his “good friend” Monsieur Macron!

1381 2018-11-12 21:40:48 How about a non-toxic hair spray?  Aside from the potential to make slippery spots, I think fly suffocation via a cooking oil spray might also work.
1382 2018-11-12 21:40:47 I wonder how many have Tory Elites have their greedy fingers in palm oil pie?
Enough to get the advert banned it seems!
1383 2018-11-12 21:40:44 STOP BUYING PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN PALM OIL!!!!!!

1390 2018-11-12 21:40:14 @realDonaldTrump Suggest you check with your economic advisors as to why oil prices are down.  Is it oversupply or shrinking demand due to the overseas economic slowing of growth?  Hmm.
1391 2018-11-12 21:40:09 Endless oil story

1393 2018-11-12 21:40:05 Man, I put like everything in there. If you like onions, we cut them up, toss in spices and just a tiny bit of oil, and throw sausages or kielbasa in with it. Wings are good! Anything frozen like corn dogs is way better. Veggies.
1394 2018-11-12 21:39:59 Ok fr, what dry fruits do you use? and when roasting, do you add ghee or oil or anything??

1399 2018-11-12 21:39:48 after watching the Iceland ad about the orangutans with rioghna and SHE FCKN THOUGHT PALM OIL COMES FROM THE PALMS OF ORANGUTANS like oh my god deadddd

Just a few little things that CLIMATE CHANGE DOESN’T CARE ABOUT.
1401 2018-11-12 21:39:45 omg now im seeing vegans go on about the meat industry destroying more than palm oil
just let people try ffs
1402 2018-11-12 21:39:34 This oil based premier slick got me feed up.
1403 2018-11-12 21:39:30 They may not be cutting oil production but the are cutting up journalists.  Why don’t you do something about that skippy.
1404 2018-11-12 21:39:28 they don't care. the only way to stop #SaudiArabia inflicted famine is to stop trade with Saudi Arabia! No more weapons and no more oil. Work from home once or twice a week to reduce demand for oil!
1405 2018-11-12 21:39:17 Don’t it’s so so dreamy I love how it goes from rock solid to a slick oil in seconds the smell is just wow I want to eat it. It makes taking your make up off a pleasure I imagine I use it just to double cleanse minus any make up
1406 2018-11-12 21:39:17 What is the relationship between Saudi, Putin, trump, oil,?
1407 2018-11-12 21:39:08 oh sure its nothing to do with oil pricing and rising interest rates causing markets to check them selves.  Always quick to claim the wins are yours when up and quick to push the downs to others. #getsomeballs and own the whole thing  its your term.
1408 2018-11-12 21:38:59 If I didn't read it wrong, WTI started trading on its own in 1983. Never has WTI dropped 11 days straight since that time.

Where will the bottom be for OIL?!
1409 2018-11-12 21:38:59 Estan creando un problema mas grande aun, tratando el Oil con un scope de 2-6 meses....  En vez de entender la solucion es de largo plazo y estructural: inversiones tienen que darse para estabilizar los precios
1410 2018-11-12 21:38:51 @ACCOMS1 @HoussinIFPEN A big concern for Saudi Arabia and other traditional producers from the Middle East-dominated OPEC is the surge in U.S. output. U.S. energy firms last week added 12 oil rigs in the week to Nov. 9 looking for new reserves, bringing the total count to 886 
1411 2018-11-12 21:38:47 A mix of long suffering and new found wealth?!?!? Or maybe it’s the mineral oil related gi issues
1412 2018-11-12 21:38:43 Saudi Arabia is increasing the oil output by 1 million barrel a day, this is a natural response from the market after the Iran sanctions and amidst a sanction-violation concerns by consumers in Europe and Africa.

1417 2018-11-12 21:38:26 Å han ska prata om konstiga människor. Hur konstigt förklarade han sin inblandning i Lundin Oil affären för några år sen, är väl fortfarande inte helt utrett

1421 2018-11-12 21:38:10 So you strategically locate your wind farms. What they are not doing is killing humans which is common with mining and oil drilling, processing and transport.
That is not cherry picking, that has been true for decades.
1422 2018-11-12 21:38:05 Well China is a quiet big importers of oil; NATGAS; coal (yeah you heard that right); materiel; every single Ag commodities on planet; even they need an international market access.
They will try to become self reliant but they will fail.
1423 2018-11-12 21:38:03 I had an oil painting done to hang above my fireplace
1424 2018-11-12 21:38:02 いってきます
1425 2018-11-12 21:37:47 Are you brain dead? Do you know what OPEC is? It’s a cartel that controls oil production which in turn controls the market price of oil. If you know this, do you think the rest of the world gives a damn what you think or that you have any influence over the market price of oil?
1426 2018-11-12 21:37:46 What’s the plan - invade and then take the oil ???
1427 2018-11-12 21:37:44 Instead of Greek Yogurt, use 1 cup water + 2 Tbsp. coconut oil or 1 cup coconut water in your Green Smoothie. #lesscalories #nomucous #vegan

1429 2018-11-12 21:37:41 Go ahead and give it a try, replacing the oil with melted butter 1:1. The flavor may be richer and the texture will more cake-like (less muffin-like).  Be sure not to over-bake the cake, as butter-based treats tend to be less moist than those that are oil-based. Kye@KAF
1430 2018-11-12 21:37:34 We need stability at around $65. Too much oil now because you gave waivers to 8 countries & Russia told Iran they will buy all their oil

1432 2018-11-12 21:37:18 I’m at Havoline XPress Lube. Free oil change for Veterans today. I appreciate that very much!
1433 2018-11-12 21:37:15 Pretty sad when such a large part of our economy is at the whim of middle easterners and what they think oil output should be.  If there is going to be a floor for oil price drops there should be a cap on oil price increases.
1434 2018-11-12 21:37:12 Great . Wait for it and who to blame when the first oil leak
1435 2018-11-12 21:37:06 Seriously Trump is the weirdest dude, he’s all about being Republican and Conservative and then uses his power to alter oil prices with a tweet.
1436 2018-11-12 21:37:00 Now please uplift our spirits and lower international flights. Oil has deeply declined and yet ticket prices not budging
1437 2018-11-12 21:36:59 The majority of automakers today call for oil changes at either 7,500 or 10,000 miles, so about every year for most people.
1438 2018-11-12 21:36:55 1973 oil crisis is closer than ever
1439 2018-11-12 21:36:55 Regular gas is 3$ a gallon in the NE, heating oil runs about the same price, we are prepared to spend $4500 just to heat a 3 bedroom house, it's robbery!  Heating oil used to be 19 cents a gallon, atrocious!
1440 2018-11-12 21:36:55 Ok
1441 2018-11-12 21:36:53 Amazed at the interview with the Oil and Gas regulation Director Tom Wheeler until I looked up his qualifications to find that he's a solicitor.
1442 2018-11-12 21:36:53 It’s like ‘now you’ve grasped plastic and palm oil...let’s talk climate change and real life long changes we all need to make’ where there’s no moral high ground or Social media likes *crickets*
1443 2018-11-12 21:36:51 Or maybe, now hear me out, we focus and invest in alternatives.  Then, we would be slowing the damage to our planet AND weaning ourselves off of big oil’s teat...

1446 2018-11-12 21:36:45 Psst@ hey "genius," higher oil prices means more oil production which means more jobs and higher wages. Figure it out, "genius."

1450 2018-11-12 21:36:29 Fragrance: If you want to add fragrance, do so during the drying cycle. Put a few drops of essential oil on a cotton cloth, and toss it into the dryer with wet clothes.

1451 2018-11-12 21:36:17 This last post of yours is effed up, too, with NO FREAKING RELEVANCE TO NY POST OR EVEN TRUMP’S POST. IN CASE YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT TRUMP IS POSTING, HE IS ASKING A FOREIGN POWER TO PRODUCE MORE OIL FOR WORLD CONSUMPTION, YOU KNOW FOR GLOBAL MARKETS, SO COSTS WILL BE LESS.

1456 2018-11-12 21:36:03 Saudi's are going to protect their PROFITS. They aren't sending USA CHEAP oil because they have too much. They'll cut off the supply and raise the price. They need US Dollars to pay for their weapons and your Trump Properties? Boy, you'd think a #StableGenius would get that.
1457 2018-11-12 21:36:03 bulb is a good place to start sha. Next thing now he's changing oil
1458 2018-11-12 21:35:47 So you are concerned about them cutting oil production but not about them cutting up a US journalist's body. Priorities.
1459 2018-11-12 21:35:44 Something I don’t fuck with; oil poppin.
1460 2018-11-12 21:35:35 Got it, you mean like Oboner "artificially surpressed" the coal, mining, oil, and gas industries ?
1461 2018-11-12 21:35:33 Well, I was trying to tell everybody the new weapons systems are accuruate defensive systems that can knock missles out of the air, I see a few may have gained that attention or followed that path.

1466 2018-11-12 21:35:10 Hey - let's antagonize Iran and unilaterally reimpose sanctions even though they did not violate agreement.  That will probably help oil prices...  right genius?
1467 2018-11-12 21:35:05 Once a year the President is expected to visit graves on Veterans Day. Is that too much to ask? Don’t think politics but your brothers and sisters in combat and wether you could tell them that to their face, that they are worth a little rain.
1468 2018-11-12 21:35:03 45 does not exist in a world of econ reality. Like everything else in in world view, it is based upon "best for me" reality. A lower price of oil is best for him. No taxes is best for him. No interest on borrowed money is best for him. Everything that gets in the way is fake.
1469 2018-11-12 21:35:00 You don’t.... which is why I stopped watching.
1470 2018-11-12 21:34:52 This is an attack on democracy by you. Not a shred of evidence and you're willing to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of citizens. Outrageous snake oil seller. Carpet bagger.
1471 2018-11-12 21:34:51 When my parents visited 3 weeks ago they asked me to wash my car and get an oil change & I have done ~nᵉither~
1472 2018-11-12 21:34:49 Sorry mate. Alberta’s oil industry will only get better with time. Prices getting high enough for producers to turn a profit on our expensive oil again. New buyers now that our biggest customer has become self-sufficient. There’s little government can do about those problems.
1473 2018-11-12 21:34:48 There is also the matter of oil that isn't being exported, because there are Americans who don't want pipelines to be built in Canada. @usembassyottawa @lamphieryeg
1474 2018-11-12 21:34:47 look at the market   Freak and market manipulator,.  as if a normal inflation of crude oil over the years matters to the citizens. God  this is unbelievable to have a president like that,
1475 2018-11-12 21:34:38 Cleansing oil is incredible ! Or the balm. And a decent moisturiser anyhow hun. Are both paramount. Go in and try a few have a play and a feel. See what you like ps the flash balm omg it’s out of this world it can make the most fullest tired skin look absolutely flawless

1477 2018-11-12 21:34:36 I'm referring strictly to oil mining companies and the encouragement needed to invest in gas harnessing and processing in order to totally end has flaring.

I believe taxation is an effective tool for achieving the stated objective

electricity chain viability isn't my reference
1478 2018-11-12 21:34:29 Y’all just need some new oil suppliers y’all be straight

1499 2018-11-12 21:33:18 Dubai's tourism love affair remains strong, visible by the influx of passengers on a daily basis. What also remains unusually strong is the massive jack-up in consumer prices everywhere, despite the recovery of oil prices. That is troubling.
1500 2018-11-12 21:33:18 Choose the open road instead of silver, oil dependence rather than choice gold.

1503 2018-11-12 21:33:06 girl: omg your highlighter is so shiny and blinding! what do you use? 

me: I meannn... I use sweat and oil. yeah, they work like a charm.
1504 2018-11-12 21:32:58 Shit why did I schedule an appointment for oil change tomorrow morning  I was gon stand in line at morphe for James Charles new palette 
1505 2018-11-12 21:32:57 We need Saudi Arabia oil and let's not forget the great deal Jared kushner signed ... so for all that let's forget about Jamal Khashoggi, he was just a resident, not even European and just a journalist .. on @realDonaldTrump scale it's probably less than human.
1506 2018-11-12 21:32:55 Very True,  I agree with you that this is all a big scam.
Ft. LAUDERDALE  has nothing to do with big oil, no oil wells or refineries anywhere. What in the hell are they talking about ?

1510 2018-11-12 21:32:21 Even our corporate utility companies warn of dangers of methane because it traps heat in our environment...oil and gas companies also release methane you poor old fool
1511 2018-11-12 21:32:20 Plenty of places that should not be encouraged for building either in density or method 

Storm-surge-vulnerable east coast barrier islands, landslide-prone west coast, tornado alley Oklahoma, low elevation and ill-planned oil refinery adjacent Houston
1512 2018-11-12 21:32:18 So u then cook everything in the pan with oil, add pureed tomato in there. Add some flour in there too. Add flavorful powder too. Boil that s****. THEN add ur meat/egg balls.
1513 2018-11-12 21:32:14 Have you been to the gas stations lately?. Gas prices are outrageous in this country. Every gas station gets to set it's own price. Why is that?.
Where is the regulations on these oil companies?. Who is in charge?.
What is your administration doing about this?.
1514 2018-11-12 21:32:12 And study results change annually. Look at the old butter studies- everyone switched to margarine- then oops that was bad- back to butter- the oil studies, the bacon studies, the wine studies....

1517 2018-11-12 21:31:59 Here's what you need to do: put a prop on the ballot: ban oil production in SLO County, along with the importation of products made from oil. Else you are being a NIMBY.

1520 2018-11-12 21:31:31 MOISTURIZE THE NAILS

Moisturize the nails and cuticles every day with a good oil (choose one of quality and specific to the nails). A good idea is to have it on the bedside table so you don't forget it and  give it before sleeping
1521 2018-11-12 21:31:30 I’m in the military, and I happen to believe that the American taxpayer is equal to the American military man or woman.

1522 2018-11-12 21:31:26 I’m at the dealership getting an oil change etc. etc for the next hour and they have a bowl of leftover Halloween candy out ... will update on how many jolly ranchers I eat
1523 2018-11-12 21:31:18 What does that even mean? Lol "Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!" 
Do you mean prices lower due to over supply? Try to be coherent and clear please.
1524 2018-11-12 21:31:18 I think for verteran's day, the oil companies whose interests they protected should give them all bonuses or something.
1525 2018-11-12 21:31:12 I’m sure the Saudis would be happy to produce as much oil as you like, as long as you keep letting them dismember journalists, slaughter Yemeni civilians, and treat women like chattel.
1526 2018-11-12 21:31:09 It was all going so well then you mentioned the s*n. Congrats on your no palm oil stance though!

1539 2018-11-12 21:29:49 Wash and set Wednesday  give me a hot oil treatment trim my ends or chop it off hell idc. My head needs this bad
1540 2018-11-12 21:29:43 Yea and i try to twist my hair whenever it’s under a cap ...i do the hot oil thing whenever I’m deep conditioning my hair but i always put oil on my hair when it’s dry
1541 2018-11-12 21:29:42 Why doesn't the U.S. buy oil from Russia?? Get control (of oil prices) away from saudis...
1542 2018-11-12 21:29:42 Send a Commission to investigate the OIL Companies & Industry,

OIL drops, gasoline keeps a high price for consumers, what gives?
1543 2018-11-12 21:29:37 You realize oil is replenishing itself right? Everything that dies turns to oil. "Fossil Fuel". Maybe look to make the production factories near zero emission first. An the the rest will follow.
1544 2018-11-12 21:29:34 Mad that I’m one post someone was taking the moral high ground and blasting anyone who uses palm oil and in the next post was trying to flog her pyramid scheme overpriced beauty products...
1545 2018-11-12 21:29:18 There is much more oil now is why price is down,but it will go up again after Christmas  tell the truth for once in your life,
1546 2018-11-12 21:29:17 I am taking each item in turn starting with the high end usage stuff and finding alternatives. This starts with “vegetable oil” which is a common name for palm oil. Equally packaging is of an issue!
1547 2018-11-12 21:29:07 For 6 months

Don't know if that's still the deal

1552 2018-11-12 21:28:29 A national pyrolysis plant would be a better solution to convert plastics back to oil.
1553 2018-11-12 21:28:23 Oil price going as low as your stock market returns now. How are you ever going to bear Obama seriously
1554 2018-11-12 21:28:22 That’s fantastic. It’s entirely possible Lacombe will be heading into Lucas Oil Stadium wearing a purple Bowser shirt.
1555 2018-11-12 21:28:18 There is no bigger bigger picture the Middle East will be the Middle East and the west trying to police it and steal its oil has been the biggest fuck up of our generation
1556 2018-11-12 21:28:13 Tom, you're going to get an explanation that is akin to way too much truffle oil (for no reason).
1557 2018-11-12 21:28:10 I am letting them off the hook - kill whoever you want just make me look good with low oil prices and all is well!
1558 2018-11-12 21:28:10 are you taking it sublingually? a lot of people just eat the oil etc. and ig your body only metabolizes ~40% of oil when you just shoot it down the hatch

1563 2018-11-12 21:27:16 I hate to say this but I would rather they used sunflower oil. I am allergic to the pollen and intolerant to the oil. Makes me very sick, I despair of it being used so often.
1564 2018-11-12 21:27:16 So holiday scented oil spilled all over my hands and shirt and now I'm walking around smelling like warm mahogany and sadness. 

I guess there can be worse things hey.
1565 2018-11-12 21:27:11 “FEED THEM” CONVENIENTLY 

it is very important that u eat foods rich in good fats such as those contained in olive oil, salmon, avocado, as well as in vitamin A (carrots, eggs, chard) and calcium (milk, broccoli, spinach, almonds)

1569 2018-11-12 21:26:58 I frankly don't care about what Saudi Arabia or OPEC does. America first (with own oil supply).

1575 2018-11-12 21:26:43 I read that as Barry suggesting the oil cos. are relying on misleading ads.
1576 2018-11-12 21:26:39 “Durrrr how does supply and demand work, also is it OPEC’s goal to keep oil prices low?”
1577 2018-11-12 21:26:33 You are more than welcome to DM me if I can help you in any way. One of my diagnoses is also Fibro. It's hard to nail down exactly what works. I've found a Sativa leaning Hybrid, or a Sativa & CBD oil help the most. Ganja coconut oil is amazing for that deep tissue pain.

1580 2018-11-12 21:26:25 Saudi Arabia is more interested in cutting up journalists than oil prices.
1581 2018-11-12 21:26:24 #Argentina $YPF 
Argentinian YPF says its 2018 hydrocarbon production likely will fall by 3%-4% Y/Y, more than previously expected, as low natural gas demand forces it to close wells and shift its focus to Vaca Muerta shale oil.
1582 2018-11-12 21:26:18 Omg bitch don’t scare me. But castor oil!
1583 2018-11-12 21:26:08 add some cream and vanilla oil or syrup
1584 2018-11-12 21:26:03 Sneaked my olbas oil into the steam room after swim tonight @paulgodsgift  my eyes though 
1585 2018-11-12 21:25:59 Saudi Arabia is a responsible country, and it cares about the international community. If oil prices rise more than it should be, the entire world economy will be affected..
1586 2018-11-12 21:25:58 Then in alotta heat, put a shit ton of oil and fly the meat and egg mixture.
1587 2018-11-12 21:25:56 What we've learned from the last 30 years of that oil companies have a very difficult plan for impeding progress and letting then continue exploring plays into that. It's already common knowledge that 80% of discovered reserves are unburnable of we want to survive /4
1588 2018-11-12 21:25:50 I’d much prefer land to be grabbed than to have it developed for oil and gas or housing or the trees mowed down so the CEO of a paper company can be a billionaire
1589 2018-11-12 21:25:42 Sure,and we will stop using their oil as well.When will people realize,this is largely about the West needing something
1590 2018-11-12 21:25:35 Here's a "yeah but" #NattyGas up nearly 30% ytd and up more than $1 since mid late Sept. Which matters more? If PPI was triggered by Oil, how's it going to react to the recent move from the late sept 2.80 level to today's 3.90 level?
1591 2018-11-12 21:25:33 Never mind the oil.  What are you going to do about them murdering that man?
1592 2018-11-12 21:25:26 Oil has always been political.

lolwut

Blame that fuck from Aurora.

lolwut

Who's always ragging on food stamps and all that? Certainly not the left.

The right are the ones who made Colin more than it ever needed to be.

lolwut

And that last one...a lot of implication there.
1593 2018-11-12 21:25:23 I’m confused why America has this obsession with oil. Y’all know we are the leading producer of oil and have had several thousand oils spills in the last 5 or so years. Now the oil company’s in Texas are asking for the government to protect them from major climate events.
1594 2018-11-12 21:25:23 And going deep into UC lore via Crossbone Gundam, Jupiter Empire reeks of Saudi Arabia and their IR policy via funding of Wahhabism into Salafi extremism via energy extraction ie Jupiter supports anti-EF groups while supplying EF with energy (helium for JE, oil for SA) (5)
1595 2018-11-12 21:25:19 I understand the appeal of that "100 companies are causing climate change" line but really, just say "The oil and coal industries."
1596 2018-11-12 21:25:17 Normal lotions have a ton of extra oil in them that are unnecessary for the face (especially an oily face) and can clog pores. Not genetics but hygiene*
1597 2018-11-12 21:25:15 All I need is a mf oil change.
1598 2018-11-12 21:25:06 It doesn't take complicated sources to know that coal, oil, and gas are all depletable resources. Just because they will not be depleted in our lifetime, does not make them infinite. Wind and solar are not. What is it you do not believe about that statement?
1599 2018-11-12 21:25:05 You say your legs hurt you need a massage, turn it over
I got some oil I could rub on your thighs, bust it open
I love the way that you hide, turn over hit from the side
Look me right up in my eyes
Tell me that pussy is mine
Yeah, and you know it's over

1600 2018-11-12 21:24:56 Why thank you. I know! I find avoiding palm oil to be a much more tricky task than choosing a vegan option. Same with plastic - really hard to completely avoid. Fish? Not so much.
1601 2018-11-12 21:24:55 Yes it does.  I know many many many patients taking even weak CBD oil and it is working.   @mandymcknight can tell you that LP CBD is what has saved her son's life.
1602 2018-11-12 21:24:52 Lmfaoooo BITCH LEMME TAKE PICS WHEN I DO MY OIL CHANGE TOO
1603 2018-11-12 21:24:52 I blocked you just so I wouldn’t have oil all over my TL. Boone’s mad bro. I could say anything to you on here and it wouldn’t mean a thing. What you gonna do?
1604 2018-11-12 21:24:50 We should be trying to use less oil, not hoping to buy more.

Put more funding in renewable resources, not the finite supply of fossil fuels that we are going to run out of before you know it.
1605 2018-11-12 21:24:48 anyone here has an oil diffusser?
1606 2018-11-12 21:24:43 stupidity and bravery , water and oil dont mix
1607 2018-11-12 21:24:36 Check out the Bill of Attainder clause of the Constitution (some courts say  it applies to corps). So a law directing one oil corp to go out of business is problematic, but a law banning (or limiting) sale of fossil fuels generally is ok. But this Congress is
not gonna do it.
1608 2018-11-12 21:24:34 @Channel4News reported oil as being up today 
1609 2018-11-12 21:24:31 Ooooh have you tried the cleansing oil ? dame smell but in a oil. I use about 90% of the Elemis brand I just adore Elemis the quality everything is just as it should be. And yes a little goes a very long way.
1610 2018-11-12 21:24:24 If people actually cared about that these corporations wouldn't be allowed to hide clean free energy inventions and buy out or silence the inventors of such devices.  We already have it all but big oil and electric companies haven't learned how to profit of it. Old crap way it is
1611 2018-11-12 21:24:12 Just wondering how do we stop deforestation for palm oil? Other vegetable oils grow less productively so by insisting on palm free products we’d just shift the problem somewhere else and make it larger? but cutting down on shampooing and pizza and biscuits also seems a bit harsh?
1612 2018-11-12 21:24:10 you don't have to support it bud.  But it's out there for people to try so that they'll know it works.  Then they can buy seeds, drop seeds, and grow then make oil.
1613 2018-11-12 21:24:00 Even less oil but much better results
1614 2018-11-12 21:23:55 My guess would be big oil lobbyists......
1615 2018-11-12 21:23:53 Silly Gilly, you are talking to a women who live in the Oil patch and if there is one thing I have learned is, you can’t fix stupid.
1616 2018-11-12 21:23:53 If Democrats keep doing what they are doing I will be moving to Poland . I am not kidding, I can afford to move there. I’ve already talked to my wife about it. As long as they have oil and gas engineering I’m good.

1618 2018-11-12 21:23:34 He's signaling one of the reasons Trump won't deal with Khashoggi. Afraid they'll cut the oil supply.
1619 2018-11-12 21:23:34 and IRANIAN OIL?
1620 2018-11-12 21:23:32 Buy oil stocks now!
1621 2018-11-12 21:23:28 he doesn't like the oil sands either.  Maybe we should quit buying his records.
1622 2018-11-12 21:23:23 wouldn't miss it Reggie! So excited to see your name forever honored in Lucas Oil! We miss you 87!
1623 2018-11-12 21:23:19 It's Oil.
It came from the North Sea.
It was pumped and exported from the Oil fields, 90%+ in Scottish waters.
That means it came from the devolved "region" of Scotland.
Yet UK gov says it doesn't know where it came from...
1624 2018-11-12 21:23:15 Next to a bottle of "brain octane oil," too no less ...hilarious!
1625 2018-11-12 21:23:13 Happy Birthday! Please come back to Panama City Florida and do another show for to help recover from hurricane Michael! Just like you did for us with the BP oil spill.  Was my favorite show I've seen here!!!
1626 2018-11-12 21:23:09 I'm disabled so I won't know for a couple more weeks when I get notice telling me what my increase will be. Last year it was $21 a month. This year probably no increase.
$21 / mth ...heating oil up  .70  cents/gal. increase does not cover rise in oil prices.
1627 2018-11-12 21:23:03 Anyone have the presence of mind to realize that Tesla and other auto manufacturers will be cutting the Saudi oil production by quite a bit more than a million barrels in the next 10 to 15 years?
1628 2018-11-12 21:22:50 Yeah, that's the last resort Berner argument when all else fails.  I have all the receipts on Bernie if you want them.  Bernie's a snake oil salesman, his wife is a grifting criminal who stole kids college tuition to pay her daughter and he's got Russian connections.  Purity tho.
1629 2018-11-12 21:22:49 No technology is appropriate for all locations. What we need is balance.  The oil and coal industries have had virtual hegemony. More options are needed to be developed not artificially suppressed.
1630 2018-11-12 21:22:45 Are you attempting to influence oil prices?  Again?  Dude!  That’s unethical!! @WhiteHouse

1633 2018-11-12 21:22:28 Hey Donnie, you ain't seen nothing yet.  Buckle up.  And by they way, oil prices and tech stock earnings worries are driving the market down.  Facts matter.

1635 2018-11-12 21:22:24 But if that keeps someone off of Clonazepam by way of psycho-somatic means, then I'm ok with it.  

We can now grow our own & make our own oil.  It's not costly forever.

Pollution from coal, oil increases our health care costs by trillions of dollars over decades - asthma, heart/lung

Environmental benefits of hemp McGill - USA, China, etc could obtain most of their energy needs from hemp fuel.
1638 2018-11-12 21:22:11 Good message worth sharing.
Important to note it was never "banned" especially not by any government agency!
It is a production by a NGO that does political stuff, Greenpeace, that Iceland wanted to use. 
Seeing as they sell Palm Oil Products, I have no objection to the decision.
1639 2018-11-12 21:22:07 Then KEEP U.S. oil IN the U.S. & stop selling it to Russia!

1641 2018-11-12 21:22:02 Who cares what those murderers do with their blood oil?
1642 2018-11-12 21:21:55 Oh palm oil is so totally bad for the environment but put that message out on other platforms (like hello, the internet) instead of state mandated broadcasting
1643 2018-11-12 21:21:54 Crude oil down almost $8.00 a barrel and 2 cents at the gas pumps in Cobleskill. What gives? The highest around.
1644 2018-11-12 21:21:54 patiently waiting for my oil change and the old man next to me says “hurry up and wait, huh?” and i’m like YES.
1645 2018-11-12 21:21:44 When they cut supply, it benefits US oil production. Wait, which side are you on here?
1646 2018-11-12 21:21:40 Let them cut it!  American oil companies will step up to meet the demand.
1647 2018-11-12 21:21:37 Change my oil dont ask me if I b hot boxing 
1648 2018-11-12 21:21:30 Sir, I respectfully suggest you revisit Economics 101. It will teach you that when a president constrains oil supply by reintroducing sanctions on Iran, the global price of oil will rise. Now, was that so hard?
1649 2018-11-12 21:21:28 RT CNNBusiness: The Dow plunged 602 points, or 2.3%. The S&P 500 declined 2%. Nasdaq lost 2.8%. US oil prices closed below $60 a barrel for the first time since February. Crude has declined 11 days in a row, the longest slump since futures trading began in March 1983. …
1650 2018-11-12 21:21:28 Ok I Love you man but cut out the tweeting to OPEC to cut production. That is false about demand being low and oil needs to stay between 65-75 dollars for a good balance.
1651 2018-11-12 21:21:26 But but but ... cheap foreign oil has driven hard working America oil-field workers out of their jobs. I thought you stood up for the American worker! #uselessOldDotard
1652 2018-11-12 21:21:10 I'd rather my man teach me manly things like how to shoot a gun or, how to change my cars oil.  I don't want a girly man. I want a real man. I also have a partner and a friend... and a REAL MAN.
1653 2018-11-12 21:21:01 Is that the deal you have with Saudi Arabia?  You won’t pursue the Khashoggi murder if they don’t raise oil prices???  You are one, sick puppy
1654 2018-11-12 21:20:58 $AMRN And I think the biggest problem facing the company is not Mineral Oil BS, it's what happens very soon as the scripts explode?  The question is Supply Chain and Capacity.  It's coming!  Docs are going to learn about it even if no rep calls on them.
1655 2018-11-12 21:20:54 Therefore there is no law against prohibiting an oil company from doing business. Voters, more than judges, are entitled to decide whether oil companies have abused their business privilege. Since oil companies are unlikely to abide, disbandment is appropriate.
1656 2018-11-12 21:20:53 So, what needs to happen is it needs to be cheaper to not use oil, Like photovoltaics have been progressing, so that's now becoming the cheapest form of electricity, at least in sunny states. I'm fine with adding a buck more to the gas tax. Things like that.
1657 2018-11-12 21:20:50 “Ethics Controversies” meaning voting for Iraq War, Killing Gaddaffi, Spreading Fracking, Deregulating Banks, Arms deals w SA after taking millions from MIC, Big Oil, Big Banks & SA. 

But you were only the Ethics Lawyer for Bush so I guess your fine with all that.

1659 2018-11-12 21:20:45 Yes, thanks to the EPA. A govt agency that is there to protect the environment, but with Trump in power and the oil industries large dollar donations to Trump-  it is drill, pillage and pollute. I predict another BP oil spill with the increase drilling in the Gulf.
1660 2018-11-12 21:20:39 To get rid of dark circles from underneath your eyes, try putting coconut oil under your eyes before you sleep.
1661 2018-11-12 21:20:35 Scotch for you and a little Scotch in the bottle for them. Everyone sleeps so well on the plane..
1662 2018-11-12 21:20:35 How about no more Saudi oil? I'm sure we could find another source that's maybe closer to home
1663 2018-11-12 21:20:35 First impressions are very important for snake oil salesmen
1664 2018-11-12 21:20:29 When oil is required, I always use Extra Virgin Olive Oil. 
1665 2018-11-12 21:20:17 Got my emissions test done, renewed my car registration, got an oil change, and bought hilarious Christmas outfits. It’s been a successful Monday.

1669 2018-11-12 21:20:11 Its the oil they used
1670 2018-11-12 21:20:05 Gotcha, years back I put a rotary switch w/bunch of diff values caps to test. I convinced myself that there was a diff in poly/oil/wax etc. I goofed around for years with coil taps, splits, phase etc. wanted some insight when jobs were brought to me to work on. Now I am stock :)
1671 2018-11-12 21:19:50 Your kidding , right .  FYI.. Oil prices are declining ... you’d already know that , if you knew much about basic economics and supply and demand !!
1672 2018-11-12 21:19:39 Hey man low oil prices are bad for equities can you stop thanks
1673 2018-11-12 21:19:37 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.

1678 2018-11-12 21:18:55 GE  needs go bankrupt  . Your oil priducers are operating at loss.  US  is now just trade wars,  and is not competing anymore.  With dollar too high  then  no export,   Or you bad economists or you have bad advisor
1679 2018-11-12 21:18:54 Western type of democracy and capitalism doesn't really work for Africa. It is preached to us in order to exploit us. All the other countries own their strategic resources except Africa. American Pension Fund owns American oil. Middle East oils owned by the host state
1680 2018-11-12 21:18:54 We aren't addicted to #oil, but our #cars are. - James Woolsey
1681 2018-11-12 21:18:47 On a day when the Saudis said they might have to cut production, oil tried to rally, but got dragged down by the broad market sell-off. That is not bullish. At all.
1682 2018-11-12 21:18:39 I'm just gonna say it: my hair is a backstabbing bitch. I use $30 shampoo and conditioner, argan oil, heat protectant spray, a $300 hair straightener and the bitch still looks like shit at the end of the day she's cancelled
1683 2018-11-12 21:18:32 You didn't research how your loud mouth would affect oil prices did you? So you start bitching about keeping oil prices low and now SA wants to cut oil production. This is your fault!
1684 2018-11-12 21:18:30 Oil companies are now happy, but voters aren't. Voters should help resolve this.
1685 2018-11-12 21:18:30 I did this at Oldham away a few years ago, car broke down, pissed oil all over a strangers drive. He was an Oldham fan, we beat them. Awkward.
1686 2018-11-12 21:18:27 $70 / bbl is a fair price.  It gets $3.50 gasoline, a strong economy + a reasonable return to US oil producers.  A strong USA needs a strong US oil industry.  Lower prices kill the US oil industry.  Ask your friend Harold Hamm.  So, don't push for an oil price lower than $70.
1687 2018-11-12 21:18:26 Are you trying to kill the oil industry?  Voted for you but this is not smart. Higher oil prices and slightly higher gas prices will not hurt economy. Putting oil producers out of business and losing thousands of jobs will. Best advice sit down and shut up.
1688 2018-11-12 21:18:14 my guess is that oil ppl wanted to pull this to try and ensure offshore drilling would continue
1689 2018-11-12 21:18:06 my tire fucked up, need an oil change, pretty sure it’s no gas in that hoe either. just throw the whole car away
1690 2018-11-12 21:18:01 The Dow plunged 602 points, or 2.3%. The S&P 500 declined 2%. Nasdaq lost 2.8%. US oil prices closed below $60 a barrel for the first time since February. Crude has declined 11 days in a row, the longest slump. #thetrumpeffect.
1691 2018-11-12 21:18:00 Yeah Saudi Barbaria is not gonna do very well at all without oil
1692 2018-11-12 21:17:55 I’ve used olive oil
1693 2018-11-12 21:17:53 Yup, and as long as the oil price is high, they’ll keep drilling, keep producing gas, keep polluting, keep buying off politicians.  You do know the history of Avila beach right?
1694 2018-11-12 21:17:48 Or maybe it was because of poor sales for Apple. And concerns about GE. Or concerns about Saudi Arabia cutting oil production. Or concerns about a global slowdown. But don’t let’s facts get in your way.
1695 2018-11-12 21:17:41 Hopefully, this dependence on others for our energy will pass when we HAVE A PRESIDENT WILLING TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY.
If we weren't constantly a nation at the teat of foreign oil, we could be and independentnation. THAT would make America great again, #PrezCoalForBrains
1696 2018-11-12 21:17:40 Interesting how at the first glance Palm oil looks like it causes so much deforestation yet in reality vegetable oil would cause four times the amount needed to compare. Buying it from a ethical sustainable source 
1697 2018-11-12 21:17:39 @AilisEgan would recommend Madhur Jaffrey (just half the amount of oil she uses).
1698 2018-11-12 21:17:38 Not when you're threatening to punish anyone who buys Iranian oil! An economist you are NOT!
1699 2018-11-12 21:17:30 Good, great to see oil prices go down the toilet

1703 2018-11-12 21:17:15 Dude pulls up in a Kia Forte5, walks into the showroom and says “I bought that at the Maserati dealership in VA Beach and I think it’s got an oil leak..” I had so many questions. 1. How’d you end up in a Kia while at a Masersti store? 2.Why are you in sales? 3.Who buys a Forte5?
1704 2018-11-12 21:17:14 “Secondary analysis of the data found, for example, a reduction in cancer deaths for people who took vitamin D for at least two years, and fewer heart attacks in people who took fish oil. And people do need vitamin D in order to absorb calcium and for other bodily functions.” 
1705 2018-11-12 21:17:12 Yes they are your close friend cause the only country you purchase oil from in high quantity are them . We are not friend cause we dont sell oil at all and we take back our country by revolution from your control . That's simple to understand .
1706 2018-11-12 21:17:03 Maybe you should be focusing on the crashing DOW and your own markets and let the Saudis control oil.  Your markets are crashing and will continue to do so until you wake the fck up!!  and deal with China.
1707 2018-11-12 21:17:02 I got beach tar on my feet once it was gross!! I tried scraping it off then icing it off and finally when I got home from Beach I had to clean it off with baby oil! But good to know about wd40!

1713 2018-11-12 21:16:33 Say hello to Rang-tan and say ‘NO’ to Palm Oil.
1714 2018-11-12 21:16:26 That's cause you walk like you've got oil wells pumping in your living room. And still you rise.
1715 2018-11-12 21:16:19 precisely. the value of a human life is entirely subjective technically, because to value someone one must judge it for oneself. therefore life must be what you make it of it to hold value to you. those who say it objectively must be so are trying to sell you snake oil.
1716 2018-11-12 21:16:13 His assumption: "As long as demand for crude oil grows…"
Again, EVs aren't a strategy, but an element of a strategy.  Crampons alone won't get us up Everest.  1/
1717 2018-11-12 21:16:12 What’s amazing is that Californians - who summarily reject oil industry ballot props and have stacked the state legislature with climate warriors - are utterly unaware of what’s coming in their own neighborhoods/cities.

Would love to see you do a deeper piece on this.
1718 2018-11-12 21:16:11 What exactly do you want them to do? Invade Saudi Arabia and take out all the oil? lol
18 people have been arrested and 5 officials were sacked.

1727 2018-11-12 21:15:32 Are y'all crazy? Oil growth? We need oil REDUCTION. Oh, guess y'all don't acknowledge global warming & climate change, contrary to all DATA & science worldwide.
1728 2018-11-12 21:15:29 Land and resources are also commodities, not only population. Those unimportant states provide much of the oil and natural gas, much of the water for California, much of the farmland, almost all of the coal (when that was more important)...etc.

1733 2018-11-12 21:15:13 You do know that the US is now the largest crude oil producer in the world and gas prices are still insane.  #TrumpFail
1734 2018-11-12 21:15:10 İf you stop oil production they would "bring democracy" to you very next day. Plus you need the money . What else are you going to export ? Camels ?
1735 2018-11-12 21:15:05 If you have coconut oil in your diet, do you eat it or mix it with hot water/tea/coffee?
1736 2018-11-12 21:15:03 It's an alt-left thing... better get used to it. If you are 100% for PR, you're racist and if you don't agree that SOGI is a full and final cure for bullying, you're  homophobic. If you don't want oil by truck / rail / tanker from Saudi, but rather by pipeline, you're a denier.

1746 2018-11-12 21:13:50 First day of coconut oil, hoping for the best
1747 2018-11-12 21:13:38 Pure scam, and I’m sure you’re in cahoots with your Saudi patrons to manipulate oil prices through phony scarcity.

1749 2018-11-12 21:13:34 Let’s quit buying oil from people that hate us
1750 2018-11-12 21:13:33 Yeah sorry I don’t know what way I typed that. I meant to ask are Nutella using an alternative to palm oil now?
1751 2018-11-12 21:13:32 Second coconut oil, esp. at night after a wipe-down/gentle exfoliation with a clean washcloth and hot water. Baby smooth skin in am (wrinkly still, but smooth!).
1752 2018-11-12 21:13:28 i hate oil and i Hate mixing colours.
1753 2018-11-12 21:13:27 Favorite salad dressing atm: fresh lemon juice, olive oil, Louisiana rooster hot sauce, salt and pepper. I'm telling you, it's addictive and it tastes good on almost everything.
1754 2018-11-12 21:13:27 A Yoon speaks.Apparently unaware of what that oil investment would do for Glasgow, Dundee, small towns, the Highlands and Islands, jobs, infrastructure.

1755 2018-11-12 21:13:25 Coconut oil is becoming more popular though.
1756 2018-11-12 21:13:16 Nonsense, no replacement for Saudi oil for the time being. Not to mention that Iran's oil under sanctions. Iraq's oil infrastructure not well ready. Venezuela's oil dwindling.

1762 2018-11-12 21:12:39 I'm sure the Presidents people are doing this but Ild be pushing hard for a oil deal with Venezuela. Their broke. Better for the USA rather than letting China and Russia stitch it up.

1764 2018-11-12 21:12:16 Since 1947, fracking has been used to make over 1.7 million U.S. wells, which has then produced more than seven billion barrels of oil and 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. (Carly Conchado)
1765 2018-11-12 21:12:15 Does carrot seed oil posses SPF ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1766 2018-11-12 21:12:10 We are progressing, but we do yet have the technology to replace, 50 million cars, used regularly, with like a Tesla. So, until then, I'm willing to let them drill in SLO county, where only 1% of CA's oil is produced.
1767 2018-11-12 21:12:05 DO IT HONESTLY oil is a whole@other ballgame and it’s gOOD
1768 2018-11-12 21:12:03 Is that right and allow Iran to get up close to Saudi Arabia and inside the Kingdom via Yemen. I don't think so. The Saudis will get their weapons elsewhere and shove the price of oil up.
1769 2018-11-12 21:12:03 What has he done materially to move the price of oil, other than to tweet about it? The only reason it‘s moved is that a lot of traders are responding to him. My point is that they shouldn‘t be. Then the prices wouldn‘t move - because he has no other actual power over them.
1770 2018-11-12 21:12:00 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradahan urges oil producing countries to keep the interests of large consumers like #India in mind while fixing prices of #oil.
1771 2018-11-12 21:11:58 The price of oil should be the same as the year for instance in 2018 it should $2.18 gallon of gas next year 2019 it should be $2.19 a gallon of gas .
1772 2018-11-12 21:11:58 his administration is plain crazy.  The markets are down abd they started with China trade war this morning, Then loco goes  tweet anti trust.? blames Democrats Then he cannot understand crude oil needs be  $70 . ya not $100 but $70 , He acts like he wants interests rates go up
1773 2018-11-12 21:11:57 @emmymadeinjapan in law recipe for sugar pie. Enjoy! For pie crust: 1 1/2C flour, 1/2C oil, 2T milk, 1tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar. Combine all ingredients in 9" pan and press into bottom, set aside and prepare filling.
1774 2018-11-12 21:11:49 Hi there! We are sad that our iconic Cocoa Butter Body Butter was discontinued, but we hope it could come back as a part of our Discontinued Favorites promotion in the future!  Have you checked our Wild Argan Oil Body Butter? It smells similarly and it's great for dry skin! 
1775 2018-11-12 21:11:41 Take oil out of the equation, which wasn’t invented by them and you would see how unimportant to humanity they are.
1776 2018-11-12 21:11:32 i wanna go to sleeeeeeep but after class i need to get an oil change and groceries Sigh
1777 2018-11-12 21:11:30 You sound like people from back in 2008, "oil will never go below $100."

Right now there are good jobs to be had internationally, but in Calgary only security jobs guarding empty offices. I agree with you that Alberta and especially Calgary won't recover without new leadership.
1778 2018-11-12 21:11:20 Ye lyca orange mobile virgin.. ufone kai samnye sab oil sell kartay hein. 
1779 2018-11-12 21:11:18 Under Obama oil prices were way cheaper than now. What do you have to say about that Mr. President?

USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999.

Your ignorance is astonishing.
1782 2018-11-12 21:11:10 Pretty close to finishing this concept numberism etching. Swipe for detail images. This is a concept for a technique I'd like to use for future pieces where I scratch numbers into oil paint on board. What do you think?

1788 2018-11-12 21:10:41 Fish oil smells like the inside of an asshole
1789 2018-11-12 21:10:37 Went in for an oil change and then found out I gotta spend 2000 to get my car fixed wtf fuck Monday’s
1790 2018-11-12 21:10:30 So that explains why you were fine with SA murdering a US citizen. Gotta get those oil prices down
1791 2018-11-12 21:10:29 Hummus prepared with olive oil can have a higher fat content than you’d expect for a “healthy food!”
1792 2018-11-12 21:10:19 I still think we can convince #biofuels companies to pick up the slack on soybean sales. Hopefully improving our chances of leaving the oil standard. Not saying because I back this president, cuz I don't. Just hoping we can always agree to leave fossil fuels behind one day.

1798 2018-11-12 21:09:57 Soon don't worry
1799 2018-11-12 21:09:53 I heard we were going to be running out of oil back in the 70s. I agree it’s a terrible experiment. Yet  I think people tune out if you say it’s finite , True it must be, yet  it’s so far down the road.  Like saying we are going to run out of gold or nickel.   Need new intro 
1800 2018-11-12 21:09:47 Markets time with @BreakfastNews - discussing Europe, Employment and why Oil has just logged its longest consecutive run of losses -11days and counting - 23% #ausbiz see you at 8.15amAEDT
1801 2018-11-12 21:09:43 So cnn its great for oil companies ? what about the American ppl having to pay more at that pump ? What is it so hard for cnn to stand up for the American people?
1802 2018-11-12 21:09:43 Are we talking just the dinos or the dinos & all their poop. It had to be biodegradable to an extent that runs like oil you change in your auto every few thousand miles, which begs the question doesn’t every living thing eventually turn into some kind of muck that resembles oil?
1803 2018-11-12 21:09:39 Yeah-  i need to stop responding. U cant talk facts or reason with bigotry. I try to get them thinking of real lasting solutions(like we'd do 4 countries w/ oil after making it a warzone) & immigration reform- but this guys foxed to the max.
Sigh.
1804 2018-11-12 21:09:31 What about coconut oil ?
1805 2018-11-12 21:09:30 Lol mine is a health condition bye
1806 2018-11-12 21:09:26 Yup, but I’d love to see everyone switch to something that didn’t need so much oil. The technology is there, just need to get out from under the oil people
1807 2018-11-12 21:09:17 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1808 2018-11-12 21:09:14 UK in early 1970s an economic basket case, oil and EU have hidden but not cured the basic incompetence of governance. EU not an empire, see how they support Irish Republic.
1809 2018-11-12 21:09:11 ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. Oboner purposely inacted regulations to kill the mining, oil, and gas industries. Trump's removal of these regulations have brought back all industries + manufacturing = FACT
1810 2018-11-12 21:09:10 Just had my first bison burger and it changed my life. Also had fries made in duck fat... bye truffle oil fries. #iminthesouthyall

1815 2018-11-12 21:08:37 Isn't oil dropping right now? Did you ask him about the Khashoggi murder? We need to know what happened to him & who is to blame. You are a putz!
1816 2018-11-12 21:08:33 If the guy in the big house wants oil lower - forces working behind the scenes to make it happen...
1817 2018-11-12 21:08:33 I’m literally staring out the window while they do my oil change. Pry annoying as hell but yo girl is hungry
1818 2018-11-12 21:08:26 Simple economics. They control supply so they control demand. Then they control pricing. If you think it is wrong then mandate more sustainable energies. You won’t do that because it hurts your friends in oil and gas.
1819 2018-11-12 21:08:24 The House of Saud is too busy dismembering journalists to cut oil production.

Of course, you gave them a pass on this murder, because you hate journalists...& Muslims, Mexicans, Jews, African-Americans, Patriotic Americans, Africans...

Everyone except for the #TrumpCrimeFamily
1820 2018-11-12 21:08:14 CBD oil won't make you high in regards to taking care of your daughter . But I'd definitely recommend it!
1821 2018-11-12 21:08:14 ‘I did something bad’ blares in the background as she places the store bought rolls in her oven, that she drizzled with olive oil and rosemary, hyping herself up to tell her friends they were ‘homemade’
1822 2018-11-12 21:08:13 would like to submerge my body in CBD oil rn
1823 2018-11-12 21:08:06 What are you doing about it though Michael? How about restricting palm oil use in the UK?
1824 2018-11-12 21:07:57 lol yeah, from the oil?
1825 2018-11-12 21:07:54 @CadburyUK Hey :) Just wondering if the Palm Oil you use in your products is sustainable? And also are you planning on stopping it’s use in your products? Many Thanks
1826 2018-11-12 21:07:48 What has he done that is relevant? Right now, moved the price of oil. Not the first time either, by any means. On his own he is responsible for the entire price structure of international oil right now. Opinions on his character are irrelevant.
1827 2018-11-12 21:07:31 Only a dying industry in the Liberal land powered by fairy dust. Thanks to backdoor $US funding of the Tar Sands Campaign your oil production is higher than ever and ours is landlocked. Most of the things around you contain fossil-fuel products.
1828 2018-11-12 21:07:23 Oil u suvha hua funiwa

1830 2018-11-12 21:07:13 you guys use palm oil in your products. no body's perfect
1831 2018-11-12 21:07:12 I need to go to the Dentist and the Eye doctor and get an oil change, a dog sitter for thanksgiving, a rental car for christmas, I CANT EVEN AFFORD TO BREATHE
1832 2018-11-12 21:07:03 Oil is down to 59 a barrel.  Woot for cheap gas!
1833 2018-11-12 21:06:55 Awwwwwkward for Tories. Defend big oil, deny climate change means Scheer is dead-man-walking.  Turn green, Mad Max and their AB + SK crowd eats them alive.
1834 2018-11-12 21:06:45 @NutellaGlobal Hi There,just wanted to know if your Palm Oil, which you use in your products is sustainable? Many Thanks
1835 2018-11-12 21:06:45 cant tell if this old coconut/essential oil lotion stuff is rotten or if it just smells like that
1836 2018-11-12 21:06:44 Ummmmm.....no.
This is why:
"Stocks dropped in afternoon trading Monday, pulled down by a broad sell-off in tech companies & Saudi Arabia's planned cuts in oil production which revived concerns of a global slowdown."
If anything, the investigations by the Dems will make it go up!
1837 2018-11-12 21:06:42 See these gas prices going down ... Then remembers it’s cold af outside and ain’t nowhere for me to go but back inside the house.. Well played Crude Oil well played.
1838 2018-11-12 21:06:34 Just think last time I took my car in for an oil change I got a call from the dealership saying the oil change was complete and so was the maintenance work but one of the mechanics put a scratch on my back bumper so car was in body shop for 5 days
1839 2018-11-12 21:06:32 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Do not brush hair when wet. Avoid applying heat to your hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? Best shampoo for hair loss. or somewhat related. How to come across the appropriate website. So outstanding. So versatile.
1840 2018-11-12 21:06:32 Oil is less than $60 a barrel..fuel prices are coming down
1841 2018-11-12 21:06:24 Today Chris and I tried to do a predominantly plastic free and 100% palm oil free food shop. I feel very proud of this, it was super hard but trying is better than doing nothing. 
1842 2018-11-12 21:06:15 The supplyof oil  is dimished because of your oil embargo against IRAN, a situation you created when you opted out of the exist nuclear agreement. 1 million less barrels a day, means less supply, and higher prices for oil. You own this increased cost Donny!
1843 2018-11-12 21:06:13 Yah really.  Very sad. And rating services and investment banks  ( the so called “ fear factory” ..I mean, hey, what do they know anyway?) are bearish on Alberta.  And now with the world price of oil heading back down it could get worse....
1844 2018-11-12 21:06:09 If #investing in my #property to ensure I don’t buy #petrol or use #oil ever again and never pay, but get paid for #electricty I generate, means I am a lunatic lefty, then what do you call a person who is happy paying large amounts of money to oil and power companies? #auspol
1845 2018-11-12 21:06:08 What did Sc3 survive on before we struck oil? You want independent Scotland but happy to sign up to #EUEmpire
1846 2018-11-12 21:06:02 With Saudis paying the rent on 666 5th I don't think they give two shits about what you think about them or their oil. You don't care either. You don't care about Khashoggi, or for starving the people of Yemen to death! Look at those BABIES, you madman. To brown?? #Fascistasshole
1847 2018-11-12 21:05:51 Dropped off my car at @Toyota for an oil change @ 7AM. Its 1oclock and still no call back. Good thing I didnt wait for it there 
1848 2018-11-12 21:05:49 Ok. Well, I'm not quite sure. I don't think it's really happened anywhere yet, on a large scale.
It went bad in Venezuela because the oil prices dropped, and everything was funded by the high oil prices. And rampant corruption by officials.
1849 2018-11-12 21:05:45 They dumped an oil tanker worth of sports trophies on us and then they tell us all we want are participation trophies. We should have known at an earlier age
1850 2018-11-12 21:05:31 My wife is responsible for the other 60% of the issues. I tell her to check the oil, or at least get it changed when the service is due, and she doesn’t do it.
1851 2018-11-12 21:05:31 Need a list on your CBD oil and medical marijuana stains.
1852 2018-11-12 21:05:19 Just how do electric cars get recharged so they can run? From the power companies........ how do the power grids produce their electricity to fuel these cars?  Mostly fossil fuels, oil and nat gas, with a smidge of solar thrown in?  How is that helping anything????
1853 2018-11-12 21:05:14 Mr President, you may need kindly to contact with @CHICAGO_USA_ And @MHAlgabani  in order to have a fully grasp of oil field.  They are intelligent people, ambitious and at the same time " Humble " .
Do you agree @isaadusa 
1854 2018-11-12 21:05:09 The transition from fossil fuels, especially oil, toward renewable sources in a “low-carbon economy” suggests the need to develop new global units of account.
1855 2018-11-12 21:05:03 Aren't you worried about the reporter that was massacred in Saudi Arabia we don't want their f****** oil
1856 2018-11-12 21:04:54 Good for you but you’re still not in the military and there is no comparison. Not paying tribute to veterans who died for our country on Veterans Day is absolutely disgusting. There are no valid explanations! Your hairdo is not good enough.
1857 2018-11-12 21:04:41 I knew nothing about palm oil till today
1858 2018-11-12 21:04:29 He's more worried about the price of oil than he is about the brutal execution of Khashoggi.
1859 2018-11-12 21:04:24 Oil, Flour, Rice...dried essentials that don't go bad.  Or toilet paper.
1860 2018-11-12 21:04:24 Something for @MikeDunleavyGov, #akleg to note: The price of a barrel of Alaska crude has fallen 14.7 percent since Oct. 1. @realdonaldtrump tweeted Monday that oil prices should be lower. He doesn’t want Saudi Arabia to cut production to raise prices.
1861 2018-11-12 21:04:17 Want to know why the stock market is headed to the shutter?
Oil is why. 
Oil controls this evinomy.
1862 2018-11-12 21:04:05 You're really between a rock & a hard place here, aren't you. You want oil prices to go up so your Oil Corporation buddies can increase their profits, but you want gas prices to drop (requiring LOW oil prices) to make  voters happy. it'll be interesting to see how this works out.
1863 2018-11-12 21:04:00 Pamberi ne drilling.  Mamanjr menge mabata oil
1864 2018-11-12 21:03:55 Dec WTI Crude Oil futures - 0.32 (-0.53%) to 59.84 bbl $USO
1865 2018-11-12 21:03:50 This sounds strange. But I think dealers are better than the fast lube prices. I buy three oil changes for $75 at the Honda dealership where I service my truck.
1866 2018-11-12 21:03:41 Last week a commercial plantation achieved 27.1 oil extraction rate in 1400 tons of fruit. Artificial pollination at works in the OxG hybrids
1867 2018-11-12 21:03:40 No clue. My ST expectation (christmas) is Gold 1400-1500 and Oil at 30-40 bucks. Either the FED capitulates by then and prints or we'll see Gold 1500 and Oil 15 sometime next year (April, May).
1868 2018-11-12 21:03:40 Why not have a read of the article Andy Critchlow has just written in The Telegraph. UK is doomed without Scottish oil.
1869 2018-11-12 21:03:39 If there's a PPT for oil -- now would be the time... Russia, OPEC getting destroyed here.
1870 2018-11-12 21:03:33 Seriously ppl watch Sir Zaid’s economic terrorism series. It’s on YouTube. It went on air in 2007, 11 years ago. Everything the man said came true. These morons didn’t give Arabs ownership of their oil neither have they allowed Baluchis or Afghanis to benefit from their resources
1871 2018-11-12 21:03:30 Don’t sell yourself too short Ben. You’ve convinced at least 100 people that you’re some sort of respectable intellectual despite all evidence to the contrary. Im sure peddling literal snake oil and bad arguments to brain dead boomers has quite the profit margin itself
1872 2018-11-12 21:03:21 Oil VIX $OVX up 14%

1874 2018-11-12 21:03:12 @Lexus You are fabulous! Dropped off my presh lexi for a recall and you ended being able to price match speedee for an oil change and american tires for new tires! So excited to get my girl back ready and safe to commute to nursing school in January! #YAY
1875 2018-11-12 21:03:09 I’m working diligently with our partners to keep the price of oil balanced for our various interests.
1876 2018-11-12 21:03:07 @AliVelshi  Please stop talking about market bad or good up or down days. As you and @SRuhle have told up, the market ups and downs have little to do with Main Street economy. If my oil prices go up, that is bad, If the market is up or down, that doesn't matter. Please STOP IT.
1877 2018-11-12 21:02:58 So does @Nestle. I will no longer buy their products until they stop using palm oil.
1878 2018-11-12 21:02:57 Come n order for your mum
1879 2018-11-12 21:02:47 #RT @SexAdviceBot: Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
1880 2018-11-12 21:02:45 It is an well known secret that this is actually what they want. MBS is trying to float 10% of its national oil company to finance his economic reform. Problem is price went south. Need it back up again before actually doing it because the reserves count towards IPO share price
1881 2018-11-12 21:02:43 Huh??? Oil pricing is at an all time low lol
1882 2018-11-12 21:02:40 Under your administration, the interest rate has increased, inflation has tripled, and you've engaged in a trade war. Oil is internationally priced in $USD. When the dollar is less valuable, prices increase. I'd expect businessman to understand this basic concept.

#IdiotInChief
1883 2018-11-12 21:02:33 Everyone at Walmart so salty and mad all the time like sheesh. Im only here for a oil change 
1884 2018-11-12 21:02:26 FYI....It’s Veterans Day....But, lets all worry about oil prices. Seems legit 
1885 2018-11-12 21:02:25 OIL IS DOWN FOR THE MILLIONTH DAY IN A ROW
1886 2018-11-12 21:02:25 The power just went out near my house and my regular oil change place was affected so I had to come to a new place and they have me staying in the car while they work and it’s weird
1887 2018-11-12 21:02:23 Oh, it’s all him.  - me thinks. 

The markets soared after Election Day results were posted. 

Dow down due to crude oil pricing, fires and other things not related to elections. 

He’s the biggest shit bag on the planet.
1888 2018-11-12 21:02:19 Oil Changed 
1889 2018-11-12 21:02:17 @realDonaldTrump You realize oil prices are bad for the stock market right...
1890 2018-11-12 21:02:02 Great news  Maz!!  The Oceans engineers.  If only humans stay off the super krill oil tablets.  Thanks for sharing 
1891 2018-11-12 21:01:57 Kills me that @JayDubcity16 doesn’t see the comedy in criticizing someone for their work ethic.  Perhaps he derives purpose from Twitter?  Silly child....
1892 2018-11-12 21:01:53 Can't wait to hear Lucas Oil LOUD with the REGGIE CHANT again!! We  you 87!!!

1893 2018-11-12 21:01:37 Coal and oil jobs were killed by dying industries, not Obama. Most mining jobs will be replaced by automation as will most manufacturing jobs. I also am against fracking, the pipline and large investments in dying industries.
1894 2018-11-12 21:01:35 Who cares? America has been oil independent for more than 3 years now. What’s your point? Other countries are buying US oil now. Stop playing a dead game.
1895 2018-11-12 21:01:31 I personally alternate between rose hip oil, almond oil and a shea butter foaming cleanser. I only use my cleanser twice a week, the rest of the week it’s the oil cleansing method or water.
1896 2018-11-12 21:01:29 Uh....last time I checked, it had nothing to do with that and more to do with oil prices. How about you stop tweeting and work on that issue ?
1897 2018-11-12 21:01:28 Today, I am thankful for coconut oil.  Without it,  I have a snowballs chance of ever getting my hair de-tangled.
1898 2018-11-12 21:01:19 Why ain’t nobody tell me it was 80$ for a oil change on German Cars  OOOWWW I’m OUTTA HERE

1901 2018-11-12 21:01:14 Oil rally short lived - now back below $59 a barrel again. Extremely volatile and negative sentiment surrounding the price of oil. Down over 20% in a month.
1902 2018-11-12 21:01:08 @cvpayne You guys, News Corp, run Dow Jones, Marketwatch and also DNA/Lexicon programs using your tagged words to signal algo buys/sells!  Fake news and u guys act surprised!  B Honest!  Talk about Your FBN Agenda, your tag words like “oil bear market,” your BS
1903 2018-11-12 21:01:05 Let me guess, burning too much oil?

1906 2018-11-12 21:00:57 If oil prices are dropping why aren't gas prices going down? 

Can anyone explain?
1907 2018-11-12 21:00:47 Oil is the fuel of the past
1908 2018-11-12 21:00:44 If there are no customers to buy oil why would OPEC produce it? Common sense
1909 2018-11-12 21:00:43 Yesterday we saw a bit of a risk rally in Asia (not sure why), which Europe and the U.S. sessions unwound aggressively with S&P -1.7% and Dow and Nasdaq over 2% as Apple lost 4% due to concern over iPhone sales. Oil has moved back again to touch $58.60.
1910 2018-11-12 21:00:38 Yes . I mix the oil with the butter .
1911 2018-11-12 21:00:35 I'd really like Scottish independence to become a reality, but I'm really beginning to get tired of approaches on social media taken by supporters who tout an "it's our oil" ideology, all the while sharing stuff that looks like it's been made in Microsoft Paint #indyref2 #scotref
1912 2018-11-12 21:00:34 Thinking back to all those "Me Voting in 2016/18" memes and they were all basically me sitting at this car dealership while it takes two hours to get an oil change.
1913 2018-11-12 21:00:32 Should we tax pet owners too? they are contributing to climate change as much as cows do. We do need oil since there is no other reliable source yet . Will you kill your pets so they don't pollute the air with their carbon footprint just like cattle. NO   Why would you. Foolish

1916 2018-11-12 21:00:19 Ugh I hate this time of year....

Impossible to write a morning note without having to rewrite something almost every day 

Today - crude oil below $59 :S
1917 2018-11-12 21:00:15 Also bond market closed today and USD went up a lot/Oil drop big. Market just low volume flush today. Tomorrow is another day.
1918 2018-11-12 21:00:11 That’s a point I just made to my colleagues. Midstream constraints and still-to-come regulation, yes. Oil prices lower, yes. But didn’t expect CO stocks to be lower a week after the NO victory than they were the day before an expected close vote. Why?
1919 2018-11-12 21:00:07 the amount of oil on my face can  be used to goreng telur 
1920 2018-11-12 20:59:51 it's essential oil time
1921 2018-11-12 20:59:49 No, we don't properly fund the VA. And we do send soldiers and Marines into harm's way for almost no benefit to those not running an oil company. But we do thank them for their service, so we're showing we care! #VeteransDay2018
1922 2018-11-12 20:59:49 Or heavy crude oil

1932 2018-11-12 20:58:52 I hope all my fellow Texans who voted Cruz last week, a mouthpiece for POTUS, reads this tweet with a little regret. Low oil prices and unbalanced dependence on foriegn oil results in job losses, not only in Texas but all over the USA. Way to put America first Donald.
1933 2018-11-12 20:58:51 Go ahead, @realdonaldtrump , short oil. I dare you.
1934 2018-11-12 20:58:51 OPEC has lost their grip on oil markets.
1935 2018-11-12 20:58:49 Yesterday we saw a bit of a risk rally in Asia (not sure why), which Europe and the U.S. sessions unwound aggressively with S&P -1.7% and Dow and Nasdaq over 2% as Apple lost 4% due to concern over iPhone sales. Oil has moved back to touch $58.60 the lowest in over a year.
1936 2018-11-12 20:58:45 I can't believe he said that, Buhari won't like this. That statement is the biggest threats to the North umpire and Emirs.
No more free oil money.
1937 2018-11-12 20:58:45 Heres a thought @kristine_stone on getting water to the west:
Invest in then build a pipeline from the  northern ice caps that would take & melt ice & snow & filter it to the contiguous US like the Alaskan pipeline for oil.  Solve the water issue & help manage salinity of oceans.
1938 2018-11-12 20:58:44 Thankful to have an amazing boyfriend who changes my oil for $2.15 and some tacos  I love you so much @TRaw334 
1939 2018-11-12 20:58:43 I saw random acts in the waiting room of an oil change place yesterday.  Whoa!
1940 2018-11-12 20:58:41 #CNBC, #FOXBUSINESS, #BLOOMBERG all note that oil by @POTUS was why the market is down 623 points -- and the China pressure without conversation but by tweets. #LEADERSHIP #POTUS #GOP
1941 2018-11-12 20:58:41 トランプ大統領＝サウジとOPECは減産をしないように。石油価格は、供給環境から更に下落すべきだ。これで引け後に安値更新。

Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
1942 2018-11-12 20:58:13 Trump doesn’t realize that part of this US boom is contributed by Oil industry which will start cutting jobs if Oil goes down
1943 2018-11-12 20:58:13 No recuerdas la implementación de las UTA en los ‘90 -el costo del gas oil - y semillas etc elevaba la unidad min rentable a 500 ha y quedaban todos endeudados? De verdad no recuerdas?  - ojo no soy K ni de cerca- pero esta economía va mal para todos menos 10
1944 2018-11-12 20:58:05 @GraceandFrankie had an episode where Frankie lambasted products with palm oil.
1945 2018-11-12 20:58:01 U.S. currently produces more oil than U.S. uses, but your Big Oil Repub Donors care more about profits, so they sell OUR oil overseas. Now you're blaming OPEC? Someone needs to teach you how the world works, idiot. Fuel prices have BLOWN UP under your incompetent "leadership."
1946 2018-11-12 20:57:58 Hardcore conventional gas crowd will die out eventually, as will recoverable oil

1949 2018-11-12 20:57:43 How about we end our dependency on oil and use products that do not destroy the planet or incite war?
1950 2018-11-12 20:57:40 I'm fully aware of Policy in the SNP however what I just told you is factual, you don't seem to know this. The SNP has ZERO control over the production of Oil or Gas in the seas around Scotland. Reserved to Westminster ... Understand?

1952 2018-11-12 20:57:37 Perhaps the US has given China a cold and she's fixing to sneeze. Chinese market slow down and oil supply glut combined with Iran exceptions and tweets?…@CNBCClosingBell

1961 2018-11-12 20:57:03 I empathize b/c I share my name with a deceased painter. 

his fans angrily tweet me about why I’m not producing more oil paintings. 

I’m sure it’s similar to the Ohio State loyalists/haters in your timeline. 

Actually, my doppelgänger (in name) died about 100 years ago.

1964 2018-11-12 20:56:52 We should be working on alternatives to oil & coal. Why are we still powering everything with fossil fuels instead of being a leader & working on renewable energy sources that could change the world for the better? Oh that's right, oil and coal companies finance you & the GOP.

1968 2018-11-12 20:56:35 Trump blamed the Dems for the stock correction before it really started. Then he wrecked oil. He must be short ES.
1969 2018-11-12 20:56:16 Iran sanctions seem to be a forcing function...funny thing happens when you whale on the currency of a major oil producer & then allow it to sell oil to some exceptions (& they are short USDs)...the price of a marginal oil barrel collapses
1970 2018-11-12 20:56:15 The #climate is collapsing. Blame mainstream media and oil companies for not informing you of the risks.

1979 2018-11-12 20:55:38 We are rejecting fossil fuels, by developing the technology to replace them, as fast as possible. What we aren't doing is banning them before a realistic solution to "how the fuck do I get to work now?" is available.

Whale oil went away when we had access to petroleum, too.

2012 2018-11-12 20:53:16 Oil prices could be put to a hold and rise ,Saudi Arabia talking about cuts .. there goes the Brent Crude ..
2013 2018-11-12 20:53:14 Those long energy were probably chomping at the bit for the market to open after the OPEC comments yesterday. Surreal to see oil plunge yet again by EOD. Craziness. #oott
2014 2018-11-12 20:53:02 When I had my shitty Saturn my oil changes were 17 dollars... now I get myself a big girl whip and my oil is almost 70... my heart. Hurts.
2015 2018-11-12 20:53:02 I take a sip of the oil yella , it bring me down to a lower level.
2016 2018-11-12 20:52:39 Gotta be tough on oil companies to not be able to polute straight into the gulf.
2017 2018-11-12 20:52:38 $SPY again thank you trump for tweeting that oil prices should be lower
2018 2018-11-12 20:52:37 Canada is doing some already... wetlands protection, reduction of plastic and oil dependency by investing in clean energy like electric cars, solar and wind. Redistributing the money collected thru carbon tax to businesses and home improvement. But  some find it useless to do.
2019 2018-11-12 20:52:33 Instead of tweeting you should be honoring our Vets, in the rain, at Arlington.  You chose instead to blow them off and tweet some crap about oil production.  #VeteransDay

2028 2018-11-12 20:52:03 For my braid wears, how often should i oil my scalp? Once a day or twice a day? Every other day? Once a week lmao i damn near oil my shit like 3 times a day 
2029 2018-11-12 20:51:59 The current price of Heating Oil is $2.559 per gallon.
2030 2018-11-12 20:51:51 @realDonaldTrump Well, this is the only complaint I have against you. I wish you hadn't caused the price of oil to go down, as we get an itty bitty check each month, but it helps on bills. Darn.
2031 2018-11-12 20:51:47 Anyone who say anything negative about this is a hater. Shiiittt I can’t do an oil change. If she being a pick me. Well shit I’d pick her  most niggas on here can’t do an oil change

2034 2018-11-12 20:51:34 It is because of this add that I now know about the harm that Palm oil is causing and can look at the labelling on my food and make the choice, first of which is buying Iceland's own brand food.
2035 2018-11-12 20:51:34 Word I know I ain’t changing my oil or nothing all I do is drive lol
2036 2018-11-12 20:51:34 my cat votes for jill stein. i've tried rubbing eucalyptus oil on the ballot but it doesn't help
2037 2018-11-12 20:51:25 Oil prices should be higher if environmental impact was included in cost.
2038 2018-11-12 20:51:25 Data is the new oil.
2039 2018-11-12 20:51:23 He’s got to fit into big boy pants first 
2040 2018-11-12 20:51:22 getting my oil changed & i feel like a big girl but now i’m bored & carless
2041 2018-11-12 20:51:20 see also: trying to find products without #PalmOil in - even if it's accurately labelled as palm oil can be described as "vegetable oil" #PalmOilFree #LowWasteLiving #EthicalHour
2042 2018-11-12 20:51:16 Everyone needs to see this. I agree with everything except that this has very little to do with the environment. This has everything to do with the bottom line of American oil companies. They are killing Canada's economy as was there plan in the guise of saving the environment.
2043 2018-11-12 20:51:13 y’all just mad hating cause u gotta pay somebody $30-50 to do a simple oil change 
2044 2018-11-12 20:51:12 The US was too reliant on oil since at least 1973 when OPEC led by our buddy Saudi Arabia declared an oil embargo as punishment for supporting Israel during the '73 - '74 war.
2045 2018-11-12 20:51:12 Well it's 10min to bed time ...

2048 2018-11-12 20:51:06 Trump to the US Energy industry today 
 

(context matters: oil has crashed $20 unsettling everyone but that’s not enough for him)
2049 2018-11-12 20:50:58 Where can I get some hash oil today today ?
2050 2018-11-12 20:50:57 For those who do not consider Jerusalem important. Here is another reason to destroy Israel. These duffers think that every natural resource in this world “is their personal property given by God to Jews.” Like oil, gas, gold, lithium, water, pasture lands. All Jewish property!!
2051 2018-11-12 20:50:53 Y’all be having sex alllll the time. Bootyhole is due for an oil change by now. 
2052 2018-11-12 20:50:43 #ChicagoCrime #SaudiArabia #Iran #oil #prices You're right.
2053 2018-11-12 20:50:42 I think I was kinda right when I said short oil when Aramco IPO done.  Well, No IPO, no need for $70 oil. OPEC will now punish our drillers again. Cycles repeat.
2054 2018-11-12 20:50:36 Why they are producing oil to get paid when buying and oil is not something easy to get
2055 2018-11-12 20:50:35 Acne you say. Buy tree tea oil and mix it with witch hazel water. Use the mixture every night
2056 2018-11-12 20:50:31 why don't you all expose how much each ex PM/MP's, have &continue to profit from the network of global leaders/business owners, including the oil/gold bullion assets of the gaddafi regime?-as it's apparent that these do not get imprisoned for conflict of interest of previous role
2057 2018-11-12 20:50:29 Tell Jated to talk with his murderous princely friend so you can claim low oil prices as your doing.  Hail the dealmaker in chief.
2058 2018-11-12 20:50:23 Yeah, much easier to work with than oil (and cheaper) Then there's the fact that it's easy to clean off things (mostly myself) 
2059 2018-11-12 20:50:21 Presumably, you know that Westminster controls the licencing of Oil & Gas drilling, while the Oil companies carry out their own development of oil fields The SNP has no obsession nor any part in any of this. Surely you know this?
2060 2018-11-12 20:50:13 We don finish dat one..na #Nottooyoungtomakemoney we dey follow now 
2061 2018-11-12 20:50:12 On the one hand, I cashed in my free oil change coupon at the dealership. On the other hand, it's taken them two hours, so, it's impossible to say if it's bad or not
2062 2018-11-12 20:50:10 Better to Cut Oil than people .
2063 2018-11-12 20:50:06 #Presstitutes CEO burning midnight oil to ensure victory for her master's and 10 Janpath! 

Sadly ..people are more aware, madam!
2064 2018-11-12 20:50:00 With sanctions on Iran you are directly increasing the cost of oil. You are the most stupid man to have ever held office of any kind.
2065 2018-11-12 20:49:55 Oil change, brake fluid flushed, check the system for anything further needed to be fixed and clean my car all for 100 ain't no car wash doing that kinda job
2066 2018-11-12 20:49:54 U keep oil down and no-one can buy America’s protection.
2067 2018-11-12 20:49:53 Winter is coming. Russia #oil output will fall anyway through 1Q. It always does.
2068 2018-11-12 20:49:53 
2069 2018-11-12 20:49:47 Okay I love @sza and her music is gold but sis cannot sing live. I just watched a live performance and idk what’s wrong with my sisters voice but this ain’t it. A break and some tea with honey and olive oil shots are due sistaaaaa
2070 2018-11-12 20:49:42 We're all drinking from the same oil well -- Amy Martin, NPR The World
2071 2018-11-12 20:49:39 Hey Donald is this your way of telling us about the impending Oil shortage that will & mostly always falls on or near a Holiday? Wow I am so glad you warned Americans, that we are going to have to buy High gas come Thanksgiving.. #potusLol..Hugs America 
2072 2018-11-12 20:49:37 Why does it matter? Trudeau will just keep bailing out his pet Quebec company while he punishes oil sands companies in Alberta.
2073 2018-11-12 20:49:29 $WLL if oil goes through 55 stk will be under 20
2074 2018-11-12 20:49:22 Next time I order skincare I really wanna invest in the Troiaruke Oil Cut Cleansing and Recovery Cream hhhh
2075 2018-11-12 20:49:21 DO NOT SPEAK FOR ME,I live in QC,I never agreed with the transfer payments,just like Maxime and he has my support and the support of a lot of Quebecers,QC refuses to exploit oil and gas therefore I don't think QC should benefit from it...we have oil and gas here too, untouched.
2076 2018-11-12 20:49:18 Hmm... Didn't you say we were now the greatest oil producer in the world? So where's all our oil going then, eh?
2077 2018-11-12 20:49:16 AGRESSIVE GREEN ENERGY & BAN OIL DRILLING & FRACKING. I know it won’t pass but if we don’t TRY HARD to address climate change in someway shape or form, the rest won’t make any difference.
2078 2018-11-12 20:49:12 These kia salesman tryna entice me with the 2019 Forte while I’m getting my oil changed. Talkin’ abt “we’ll just go for a test drive.” I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ABDUL!! I WENT FOR “JUST A TEST DRIVE” LAST YEAR THIS VERY MONTH AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!
2079 2018-11-12 20:49:04 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
2080 2018-11-12 20:48:59 How is extracting and using up our finite supply of oil a good thing?  The whole point of exploiting foreign oil reserves was to *not* use the US reserves.  This shows a failure of leadership and is nothing to crow about. Crow.
2081 2018-11-12 20:48:32 Found out today I’m allergic to juniper berries but somehow I can drink gin just can’t touch oil or anything with juniper berries in it, logic 
2082 2018-11-12 20:48:26 Tunanin yadda zai sarrafata yake 
2083 2018-11-12 20:48:22 They should be giving us the oil. Always getting away with Murder.
2084 2018-11-12 20:48:21 Cooking oil yangu inopera ndichiPoper mapopcon. Yah the plot is thickening now
2085 2018-11-12 20:48:20 The Canucks definitely have some skill, but so do the Oilers. Huge difference is the compete level, the straight out max effort the Canucks bring every night.

What is the reason that the Oil cannot at least bust their ass regardless of outcome, and who is to blame for that?!
2086 2018-11-12 20:48:18 yeah, 6 figures is totally working like a slave

2088 2018-11-12 20:48:05 And when was Iceland political?that was making awareness nothing more. if they chose not to show prawn rings  good on them.. plenty other political garbage but because it was a food shop it's a no! Sure you all live nutella ..well that is the biggest user of palm oil
2089 2018-11-12 20:47:51 Partisan BS... the same way they require chain restaurants to include the calories on the menu and stop using transfat oil.
2090 2018-11-12 20:47:49 Oil didn’t “build” Dubai. But carry on.......
2091 2018-11-12 20:47:42 This is more leveraged than oil, by quite a bit.  Difference w/oil is "stock to flow ratio" of oil is 1.1-1.3x, which means paper & phys prices can't separate for long.  S/F ratio of gold is ~65x, which means phys & paper can separate for a long, long time.
2092 2018-11-12 20:47:42 Organic shampoo and conditioner made on island + olive oil and eco styler. Nothing much
2093 2018-11-12 20:47:40 @PontiffJPowell Oil crashing. Nice job
2094 2018-11-12 20:47:36 Why are you tweeting about oil and no visit to Arlington National Cemetery? No wreath laying, too tired, rainy, just curious.
2095 2018-11-12 20:47:29 ah...oil futures... ...?
2096 2018-11-12 20:47:26 Bitch it’s like you paying me back for all the times I did your makeup and the oil that you dropped not once but twice actually 3 times it was 20 bucks btw 
2097 2018-11-12 20:47:25 Republicans hate high oil prices. Bring back Dems and Obama and make oil prices great again #OOTT
2098 2018-11-12 20:47:24 Matan Kaduna da Matan Kano, Kamar Da Engine Oil Aka Shayar Dasu... 
2099 2018-11-12 20:47:21 Plus a bold vision on climate is exactly what's needed to make it a relevant electoral issue. If Dem "solutions" aren't solutions, why would anyone vote for them over GOP b/c of climate? Taking fossil fuel money means voters just see both parties as beholden to Big Oil interests.
2100 2018-11-12 20:47:20 Lol toh we no go kill ourselves na
2101 2018-11-12 20:47:19 Cant wait for the world to go solar, geothermal, biodiesel. and make oil obsolete...
2102 2018-11-12 20:47:18 MY GOD WESTERN MEDIA  IS SO STUCK UP ZIONIST ASS I'M SURPRISED THEY CAN SMELL ANYTHING OTHER THAN  SHIT. WHY DON'T U GOUGE OUT YO EYEBALL  DIP IT IN OIL SHOVE IT UP YO  HAIRY RED ZIONIST ANUS LET IT FESTER FOR A WHILE THAN FUCK YO SELF WIT IT #FreePalestine
2103 2018-11-12 20:47:03 Lies like,
EU advice.
Keeping the pound.
Oil price remaining constant at $110 a barrel.

Those lies?
2104 2018-11-12 20:47:01 Yes, I feel annoyed about it, wish they had spent the money on their own ad (or even better, on getting rid of palm oil). The Greenpeace message didn’t emerge very clearly at all, in fact it took a friend to tell me it was originally a @Greenpeace ad. Hmm.
2105 2018-11-12 20:46:59 You had your last laugh with your so called "Formula".Only now you realize the prices of oil?It's a wee bit late,isn't it?

Keep whining,you wont change a thing
2106 2018-11-12 20:46:56 Yes, little boy.

That must be it.

Now run along back to your fantasy games. Reality is too big for you.
2107 2018-11-12 20:46:52 Does Trump realize that lower oil prices will destroy high paying jobs? He's already destroying farmers, I guess energy companies are next.
2108 2018-11-12 20:46:48 Kwakwakwakwakwa...sorry I'm laughing. It's not funny but funny.

Those are more than rats abeg. Rat wey dey lick oil
2109 2018-11-12 20:46:37 Oil and Banking. Read it slower.
2110 2018-11-12 20:46:30 As oil goes down so will the stock market. Shows you that @realDonaldTrump policies are not helping markets. Big difference from @BarackObama who had markets in great shape for 401 k.
2111 2018-11-12 20:46:30 Oil & gas lobbyists spoke loud & clear & spent over $13 million to defeat initiative 1631 in Washington
2112 2018-11-12 20:46:28 What happened at Wharton? Did you even attend? At all? Okay DJ, again... the Saudi interest is in seeing higher prices for oil, so if supply is up and prices are lower, the Saudis will want to sell a bit less... my god you are just dull!
2113 2018-11-12 20:46:27 That's what y'all say until she shows up with another pretty friend and your heart will head south
2114 2018-11-12 20:46:19 Ayo why I went to put the hot oil treatment a place my momma could find it and I found shower caps 

Lmao why I got a plastic bag on my head

2118 2018-11-12 20:46:12 close half the swing if u want at 22.75  LOL.  I see oil testing 63-65. My hit 55 add other half.
2119 2018-11-12 20:46:11 As oil goes down so will the stock market. Shows you that @realDonaldTrump policies are not helping markets. Big difference from @BarackObama who had markets in great shape for 401 k.
2120 2018-11-12 20:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, however the open border policies of this Administration.
2121 2018-11-12 20:46:01 Calling the challenge “Herculean” is metaphysical. Opinions are massless, and require zero effort to change. New ideas spread faster than big oil money. The non-partisan idea I’d like to spread is that voters can put an oil company out of business by voting for someone to do that
2122 2018-11-12 20:46:00 Sure they will - you gave certain countries a pass on the Iran sanctions while you made Saudi promise to step up oil production. They're not stupid - they will cut back until Iran has to
2123 2018-11-12 20:45:51 As oil goes down so will the stock market. Shows you that @realDonaldTrump policies are not helping markets. Big difference from @BarackObama who had markets in great shape for 401 k.

2125 2018-11-12 20:45:46 Finally made an appointment to get a new headlight in my car AND get an oil change.... am I an adult yet?

2127 2018-11-12 20:45:36 odd Trump would tweet that post election. we could be back to wanting gas lower to raise the federal gas tax to pay for an infrastructure bill. with US the largest producer now, not really sure why he'd want to talk oil lower and hurt the US oil industry
2128 2018-11-12 20:45:35 Do you know how this compares to oil.  Is there 100x more paper for oil than deliverable barrels of oil? Just wondering how far this is from anything approaching "normal".
2129 2018-11-12 20:45:33 Love straight up CBN for sleep. Even more effective than my previous go to 1:1.5 thc:cbd oil.
2130 2018-11-12 20:45:27 Kk I finally got my oil changed but I still don't know which button pops the hood
2131 2018-11-12 20:45:24 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2132 2018-11-12 20:45:13 @realDonaldTrump sounds like you are afraid you’ve lost control of Powell so now you are trying to keep oil down so there is not a recession through 2020. Remember you will have oil patch recession if prices stay below $60.
2133 2018-11-12 20:45:13 Plastic club, plastic fans, trophies bought with product that makes plastic = oil, they were a busted flush an about to expire, lets launder some dodgy plastic making money #youaintgotnohistory #lfc

2137 2018-11-12 20:44:57 If you push them it’ll be apparent that they don’t have spare capacity..let them “cut” under the guise that they’re acting for OPEC & they might be able to hide the fact that they can’t keep supplying at this rate..why did you issue waivers if the Saudi’s could provide more oil?
2138 2018-11-12 20:44:49 From wildfires, to climate change, to the blue wave, now to oil leaking into the ocean.  What do you want to talk about next the conspiracy theory behind shape of the urinals in the men's restroom?  WTF!! 

I'm telling you out of concern, you need to stay off that Q shit.

2140 2018-11-12 20:44:45 Waiting for the Jeep to get fixed, oil light and tire light both insistent that SOMETHING IS WRONG, and Maury Povich Show has a man who beats his wife with a broom stick. 
2141 2018-11-12 20:44:44 Yes they should. Oil companies are greedy at the pumps! Loved it when @BarackObama would mention penalties against the oil companies .. and the pump prices came down! He didn’t just tweet about it.. he did something about it. @CNN
2142 2018-11-12 20:44:42 Not only that there is oil rigs near that area and we all know how flammable that is
2143 2018-11-12 20:44:37 $USO $CL Collapsaroo. Slowing econ and gut if reserves. Only Saudi scammers can save oil from going back under 40
2144 2018-11-12 20:44:34 It is not the canola oil but the very large possibility of it being smothered in various pesticides! Coconut oil is awesome but we are struggling to keep up now without replacing every other oil with it!
2145 2018-11-12 20:44:33 I almost bought Ritz yesterday because they are cheaper and you get more than buying the "healthy" brand. But saw they use palm oil so I went w healthy brand that doesn't use palm oil. Trying to put my dollar to good use when I can.
2146 2018-11-12 20:44:23 You put sanctions on Iran to limit their oil production.
2147 2018-11-12 20:44:20 That was US shale oil not Canadian bitumen. Bitumen does not have the same explosive properties. 

And bitumen can be shipped by rail with no dilution at all making it near sold and totally inert. Very safe
2148 2018-11-12 20:44:19 No. It was olive oil
2149 2018-11-12 20:44:07 Yeah ...let President Trump do what he wants to do where it concerns our oil wells and drilling.
2150 2018-11-12 20:44:06 Why would we buy oil from those hateful savages?
2151 2018-11-12 20:43:59 Cannabis oil > CBD oil
2152 2018-11-12 20:43:47 I've been recommended an oil today  from a strain called Phoenix Tears, David Hibbert Foundation? You ever heard of / tried that mate? Supposed to be the bollocks for us Stage  IV's.
2153 2018-11-12 20:43:40 Shocked that the "steal Libya's oil" lady thinks Dems are great on climate change and that massive donations from the fossil fuel industry aren't corrosive.
2154 2018-11-12 20:43:34 Oil traders have felt this for 4 years.  Bean traders since April.  No comparison
2155 2018-11-12 20:43:33 The moment when your scared to death about frying meat because you're afraid of getting burned by frying oil
2156 2018-11-12 20:43:31 I thought we had our supply. Didn’t you give the finger to OPEC? Hmmm Can’t remember which oil producing nation you pissed off and now you want a favor. Hmmm
2157 2018-11-12 20:43:22 UK surviving on Scottish oil, EU has provided some mitigation of economic mismanagement by successive governments. Brexit will destroy financial services income stream. UK will become a banana state.
2158 2018-11-12 20:43:17 Alberta needs to get WTC prices for their oil, not $20/ barrel.
2159 2018-11-12 20:43:15 Brent crude fell by US6 cents or 0.1% to US$70.12 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US26 cents or 0.4% to US$59.93 a barrel. In after-hours trade Nymex was trading near US$58.90 a barrel.

2160 2018-11-12 20:43:14 Because of how people like you potray the north carelessly with your utterances , sometimes so demeaning and condescending.
2161 2018-11-12 20:43:01 This is true. And like @JohnKerry said; there's nothing more discouraging than the belief by citizens that the system is rigged against them. Corruption creates an uncalled lust for power and a vacum for terrorism & conflict. It wanes opportunity especially to women and girls.
2162 2018-11-12 20:42:58 CBD anything, it don’t gotta be treats dummy. I was just saying. There’s oil u can buy and put in their water too.
2163 2018-11-12 20:42:57 Boil a pot of water then add something to the water [optional] then lean your head over the pot and inhale the steam. ACV and black seed oil worked best for me but even lavender oil is pretty impressive.
2164 2018-11-12 20:42:57 That and the stronger dollar and cheap oil prices due to cheap shale oil. All good things , this will shake out.
2165 2018-11-12 20:42:50 1.Castor Oil 
-Massage a few drops is Castor oil into your eyebrows with your fingertips 
-Keep it on for 30 minutes .
- Wipe with make-up remover, and wash your face with warm water
2166 2018-11-12 20:42:45 $100 $WTI level Will bring back zombie US shale and shallow water explorers into play. Thats what caused oil price collapse in 2014. #OPEC and #Russia working to see that doesnt happen again.
2167 2018-11-12 20:42:43 Why wouldn't they. Isn't it part of your deal, when they buy all those weapons from you? Not to mention that is it US refineries that are the real cause of oil prices skyrocketing, and influencing stocks.
2168 2018-11-12 20:42:41 heating oil subsidy. section 8, disability,  good turkey stuffing
2169 2018-11-12 20:42:40 I actually think this is right. Side / street roads would be harsh but if hitting a motorway all relevant checks should be made. Water , rubber,  electrics , glass, fuel , oil ect should be checked before set off.
2170 2018-11-12 20:42:34 HYOLD ON my big sis just told me coconut oil is more harmful than butter in cooking.... HWAT
2171 2018-11-12 20:42:24 Heres the deal support mid east oil and terrorism or support Canadian economics don't like oil go west and protest the big consumers #UuseOil2
2172 2018-11-12 20:42:18 Better yet. Let's get rid of our need to rely on Saudi Oil. The stench on our national soul is not worth the starvation of Yemeni children!
2173 2018-11-12 20:42:17 @JimStoppani laxogenin thoughts? is it effective or snake oil big fan btw
2174 2018-11-12 20:42:12 The problem with 'certified' palm oil is that bad palm oil still gets into the supply chain.  The RSPO oversight relies on companies & their suppliers being honest. One supplier had their certification re revoked just last week for bad practice. Plus the choclit tastes horrid.
2175 2018-11-12 20:42:12 I read som e years ago that Heath wanted to give away the undersea mineral rights (North Sea Oil and Gas) too but was warned it was a step too far and parliament wouldn’t go for it. The man was treacherous.
2176 2018-11-12 20:42:07 Hair spray, cigarettes & oil of Olay reminds me of my Mamaw.
2177 2018-11-12 20:41:37 We about to go rob the train with the wagon of oil
2178 2018-11-12 20:41:36 Nonsense. Other producers would make up the difference and the price of oil would rise.
2179 2018-11-12 20:41:36 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2180 2018-11-12 20:41:35 Bearish oil stocks...
2181 2018-11-12 20:41:31 Finn here, still waiting for my Iraq War oil money.
2182 2018-11-12 20:41:05 Tgank you @realDonaldTrump for crashing the market with your dumb oil tweet.
I hope eric Jr and Icahn made bank on their puts
#maga
2183 2018-11-12 20:41:03 Uhmmm. you would know why if you knew how to do an oil change and realized that i HAD too bc the drain cap fell in there
2184 2018-11-12 20:40:58 US is the world's largest producer of oil. Duh!
2185 2018-11-12 20:40:52 Oh too many for 280 characters! I like them caeamelized in a cast iron pan with olive oil, salt and pepper and drizzled with maple syrup. Or cooked with bacon and onions. Those are my favorites
2186 2018-11-12 20:40:45 Oil really been sitting the bed since this morning, both WTI and Brent.  And don't me this is Trump's tweet, it goes way beyond that.  Products is your bigger tell IMO, especially distillates (?)
2187 2018-11-12 20:40:37 Smoke oil everyday
2188 2018-11-12 20:40:36 #Oil off-1.4% directly after #Trumps tweet.  Playing the market like a fiddle.

Expect his associates are making a fortune.
2189 2018-11-12 20:40:32 He should take 10 minutes to read about palm oil before spouting
2190 2018-11-12 20:40:26 フラン姐さんに殴られたなう
2191 2018-11-12 20:40:23 comments are lmao
2192 2018-11-12 20:40:18 Crude oil $58 handle

Human-rights-crushing-authoritarian-regimes sad.
2193 2018-11-12 20:40:14 There you go again - tweeting stuff ye don’t understand.  Cheap oil kills the environment and is linked directly with climate change.  Ye are not too smart tRumpy.
2194 2018-11-12 20:40:10  Save up, invest & retire at 45.
2195 2018-11-12 20:40:09 Oil is now down over -2% today after House of Saud decided they'd use the US holiday light volume day to stoke up myopia over a production cut.

Hey @larry_kudlow maybe you're right & it is different this time. Not the asset class or price direction you wanted, but still.
2196 2018-11-12 20:40:09 Hi Hannah, these are made with a blend of wheat and cornflour, vegetable oil, natural sugars and raising agents. 100% #vegan but we can’t tell the difference!

2198 2018-11-12 20:40:05 Family Nutrition: Mountain Dew this November? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
2199 2018-11-12 20:39:56 Pasta (gluten free in my case) with a super quick sauce made with fried onions, olive oil and tomato purée. Fried tomatoes on (gf) toast. Baked feta (baked wrapped in foil with honey, black pepper & whatever herbs are to hand) served with raw tomatoes. Avocado & vinaigrette.
2200 2018-11-12 20:39:44 Mi get a oil name di Bad Coolie Duppy.
Chus mi.
2201 2018-11-12 20:39:42 what a waste of time.  you could have bought a Camry SE and never seen the dealer for anything but a 15 minute oil change every 5k miles.
2202 2018-11-12 20:39:41 Palm oil is about as unsustainable as it gets, and contributes to habitat loss and the endangerment of species, including elephants, rhinos, tigers and orangutans.

2203 2018-11-12 20:39:30 @IanRiccaboni, is the three man team with you, @ColtCabana, and @CapriceColeman the plan for the future? I enjoy the chemistry, plus no room for @RhettTitusANX, which keeps baby oil off your suits. 
@ringofhonor
2204 2018-11-12 20:39:25 @GregMannarino Despite Oil gaining after Saudis hinted on a production cut. It's now fallen off a cliff.
2205 2018-11-12 20:39:24 If oil prices are high based on available supply, then inventories should be rising since prices are above equilibrium.  More likely, Tiny is clueless.
2206 2018-11-12 20:39:23 HSBC have billions invested in palm oil they also control clearcast the company who stopped the advert from running, it's all about the money as usual
2207 2018-11-12 20:39:14 Cont /6. And finally- opec-nopec - pump at max, trump -pushing oil down -> squeezing #us shale. Winners - opec-nopec. Loser -?
2208 2018-11-12 20:39:14 You can either use pancake mix or funnel cake mix and just dip them joints in the mix and fry em in oil
2209 2018-11-12 20:39:13 #Saudi's are cutting #oil #production by 1million barrels a day. #lowerdemand.
2210 2018-11-12 20:39:11 That article was written in November 2013. Oil was at ~$110 as per your chart.

So the answer is "no".
2211 2018-11-12 20:39:10 To bad it seems most fish oil pills are crap.
2212 2018-11-12 20:39:01 RT @elonmusk: @SeanGVarney That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
2213 2018-11-12 20:38:56 Egypt +The P/A has a blockade on wages, oil, electric, water etc on Gaza which Israel breaches for humanitarian reasons... today Israel and Qatar transfered 15m to pay the civilian civil servants/workers unpaid by the P/A for months.
2214 2018-11-12 20:38:52 I'd tell them that most EOs aren't safe to ingest as an adult but that oregano oil is especially dangerous in any amount to children. They'd say "But I read it on the ___ site..." Of course people can be allergic to the pure plant EOs! Of course EOs can be toxic internally!
2215 2018-11-12 20:38:49 Still carry eye's go market oooo sincere advise.
2216 2018-11-12 20:38:40 £28bn How much of that is oil and gas imports from Norway?
2217 2018-11-12 20:38:39 Actual ororo, olive oil. My neck long die. I gats show off
2218 2018-11-12 20:38:38 I buy a ridiculous amount of rosemary, peppermint and juniper oil for my 'make-the-room-smell-lovely' infuser thingy. But it really makes me happy.
2219 2018-11-12 20:38:38 Man, I love my job but holy crap does Oil move slow af when it’s cold, 55g of 85w140 gear lube took more than A HOUR to pump that’s averaging less than a gallon a minute! And now I’ve got 250g of 15w40! Good thing my truck is warm!
2220 2018-11-12 20:38:36 Josh reynolds and g. Everett
 All they xsn do. Enunwa (Wr , NYJ), Everett amd J. Smith (te, Oil/Tit) similar type players.
2221 2018-11-12 20:38:28 Lace it with palm oil, few mins it’ll open.
2222 2018-11-12 20:38:24 So this is what's wowing u abi, with the vast wealth of this nation, increase in crude oil price, and the looted funds that were recovered, so u want to deny or pay deaf hears to the rate of poverty out there on the streets... Suffering everywhere u go
2223 2018-11-12 20:38:21 POEC is one big SCAM. They allow, they cut, they leave it as is... All games just to fuck with the price of something this big as desired. i think it is bullshit after all the money we have spent saving the asses of oil bearing countries.
2224 2018-11-12 20:38:16 Face plant in crude oil should be the 5th and final wave of the current decline from the peak, though there is still that 57.01-57.44 Fib confluence area just below
2225 2018-11-12 20:38:11 I've worked more holidays that not over the last 10 yrs. It isn't slave work. I work in water treatment. Water doesn't care that it's Sunday, or Christmas, or that its 2am.

You like clean water? You like electricity? Fuel?

Fuck off and do like the man says...Get a big boy job.
2226 2018-11-12 20:38:01 Lower oil prices like all consumers
2227 2018-11-12 20:37:57 Used motor oil always floats on water 
2228 2018-11-12 20:37:40 I swear u said last year we produce more oil then those 2 combined???.....it's cool if u didn't ......but I doubt it
2229 2018-11-12 20:37:39 Who should we listen to about this Oil thing..? OPEC, or the guy from the apprentice? Just wait until he finds out how many ppl (voters) work in the Permian today, and immediately sends out a bullish tweet.
2230 2018-11-12 20:37:38 US oil producers want OPEC to cut production so prices will rise and they can restart US oil wells. Shame liddle donny doesn't understand basic economics. But it's understandable given he spent his college days dodging the draft.
2231 2018-11-12 20:37:36 The huge U.S. amount of oil MIGHT create a glut that cannot be controlled and hence.......
2232 2018-11-12 20:37:33 depending on the glue, WD40 or olive oil works well. #ethicalhour #lowwasteliving
2233 2018-11-12 20:37:32 Snake oil chuck shumer wants the fake Russian investigation to go on so that it takes away from crooked hillary and obama administration illegal act that were done which we can prove. Go president trump drain the swamp.
2234 2018-11-12 20:37:30 The Devil don't go to Church or or Cemertary where he has no control over other Godly being and death spirit.he is only allowed to listen to the pastor he has already munipulated .the one who means no good but can send his wife to Africa to hold some  black kids For Oil not help
2235 2018-11-12 20:37:29 RSPO should limit the production of palm oil considering the total land area in a specific country, this will lessen the destruction of forests for expansion of production and in this way, giving a chance to other country to produce same product.
2236 2018-11-12 20:37:29 Why are you tweeting, why aren't you showing respect for our Veterans? I could care less about Saudi oil on this holiday for our Veterans, You are pathetic and show no respect for our troops by not even showing up at their cemetery, Arlington. #ResignNow
2237 2018-11-12 20:37:16 The precious guy that changed my oil today asked if I did a lot of highway driving and I said yes, I do. Pittsburgh and Kentucky all the time. And he said, “you go to the good old mountains of Kentucky?” And I wanted to cry
2238 2018-11-12 20:37:15 Balls to that mate, if you can’t beat them, join them. Give me dirty, stinking oil money. I’ve had my fill of this current palaver.
2239 2018-11-12 20:37:12 @realDonaldTrump 3d Cascadia fault at 318 years show how deformed the fault is to date. See for yourself if you think you have 700 years like the oil corps think your wrong. Make no mistake fema are not going to be blamed.
2240 2018-11-12 20:37:07 Nutella is almost half palm oil, you need to go cold turkey lol
2241 2018-11-12 20:37:06 I asked BM about that for the Advance, but they said it they'd done samples and it was still white after 4 years compared to oil. The Regal I think is 100% acrylic. I'm loving their paints at mo.
2242 2018-11-12 20:36:58 If Saudi cutting supply and increasing the price of oil, May be we should consider buying cheaper oil from Iran . Courageous leader make courageous decision
2243 2018-11-12 20:36:53 We don’t need oil Trump. Get out of the dark ages old man!
2244 2018-11-12 20:36:50 We could reduce America’s dependence on oil if we could bottle your hot air rhetoric.
2245 2018-11-12 20:36:44 I worked for an EO company and my experience answering customer questions informed me that there is some egregiously dangerous information being spread by dopes who don't know shit. Like "I want to treat my toddler's strep throat with oregano oil - how much is safe to ingest?"
2246 2018-11-12 20:36:42 Still dying over this quote from @Stassney on Saturday: “why do the twins look like they just changed my oil?” @Maddenbrothers
2247 2018-11-12 20:36:27 Indeed. If we lose the aboreal tropics to Palm oil or beef, we are doomed, but we must not lose sight of what can do within our own borders
2248 2018-11-12 20:36:17 Oil of cloves on your gums until you can get pain killers or go to the dentist. :(
2249 2018-11-12 20:36:17 You need to change oil
2250 2018-11-12 20:36:11 What can I tell you. I've been watching since the Jon Pertwee days. I remember Jo Grant leaving the Doctor to join a hippy commune that unit helped defeat an evil oil company, and Sarah Jane getting in trouble with aliens for her overt feminism.
2251 2018-11-12 20:36:10 Dude is a snake oil salesmen. He will say the right things but in the end he will never deliver.
2252 2018-11-12 20:36:09 Lol I didn't say anything ooo
2253 2018-11-12 20:36:08 ( This could be th solution of RSPO kay nihawa man gud ang palm oil industry ani because they could not agree with the terms in the contract, imagine international agreement nani ang RSPO)
2254 2018-11-12 20:36:07 I love these dudes! Of course this has nothing to do with recent events! -- As long as we are addicted to oil they have us by the balls
2255 2018-11-12 20:35:59 I started using the gummies many months ago, and they helped me get a better night's sleep. I recently started taking the oil (in the dropper bottle) and have been very pleased with the results too!! Relive Everyday is a great way to get your CBD.
2256 2018-11-12 20:35:55 Yup.  If the real gold/oil ratio is 100x, Russia is indifferent to gold at $1200 & oil at $12 or oil at $75 & gold at $7500 (medium term).  But at the former, the US shale sector & a big chunk of related industry doesn't exist.
2257 2018-11-12 20:35:53 The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) must review their policy to help in protecting and maintain the environment while continuing the production of palm oil.
2258 2018-11-12 20:35:53 Dear Mr President,
If reserve is too high, production must be cut. This is basic, you cannot change it. Go and read about the ABC of Oil, then comeback here.
2259 2018-11-12 20:35:48 I'd rather have the troops on our borders than strewn across the middle east fighting for oil.
2260 2018-11-12 20:35:41 @SaraEisen oil just had a big sell off the last half hour over a buck 50
2261 2018-11-12 20:35:33 Eg, Iceland can’t have an advert of the devastation palm oil causes  to political wtf.
2262 2018-11-12 20:35:27 @Naija102FM my day was fine actually, but the end was amazing, I got into a tricycle with a lady driver , d ride was funny actually though slow from Oregun to Ikeja  she needs a Lil more confidence.
2263 2018-11-12 20:35:26 so who liquidated 50,000 contracts in the last hour . #oil
2264 2018-11-12 20:35:25 Is Oil Changes like "Big things" in America? Because as far as I know, it's not even an issue with cars? Is it? You make it sound like cars in America need an oil change every year or something? I've not had one in 5 years..
2265 2018-11-12 20:35:22 Global Slowdown Risk

#Oil was NOT able to hold the 71/bbl level

69.42 Brent Crude
2266 2018-11-12 20:35:21 You should get a new channel. Try looking up the research from the University of Alabama. Everyone needs a gullible buyer. So how do you explain the amount of oil that leaches into the ocean every year?

2269 2018-11-12 20:35:02 As the weather drops, so is the moisture levels in my skin where’s the coconut oil?? (FYI, way better for your lips than chapstick that contains waxes to promote dryness)
2270 2018-11-12 20:35:01 He doesn’t rule my world. I couldn’t care less about him, and the point is: neither should you. Again, how specifically can he directly affect what a barrel of oil should cost? How specifically?
2271 2018-11-12 20:34:59 #DidYouKnow, the word #petroleum literally translates to “rock oil”?

#Facts #PhelpsGaskets
2272 2018-11-12 20:34:57 Kevin, can you please point out where you disagree with the article?  What Mathieu missed was the financial system being built on a mountain of debt. Oil is the energy multipler of consumption. Otherwise it's bang on target.
2273 2018-11-12 20:34:51 Absolutely!! Always good to have plenty of oil to hand. 
2274 2018-11-12 20:34:48 Got to get that oil change in my baby before I touch that controller 
2275 2018-11-12 20:34:40 Wall Street Instant Update; No holiday for the bulls with #Stocks dropping by 540 Dow points at 25,450, Nasdaq Comp. off 2.5%, S&P -1.8%

#Gold -.4% at $1203.50
2276 2018-11-12 20:34:32 Coz FES has funded stuff on hydrocarbons with “capitalist” big oil and gas people speaking, just as another cherry picking example.
2277 2018-11-12 20:34:25 Personal friend has breast cancer with metastatic spread to hip bones. She has been using canna oil and has begun growing back bone. Drs amazed when she told them what happened cos chemo rejected.Miracle plant
2278 2018-11-12 20:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
2279 2018-11-12 20:34:19 Are people serious. They want an oil change. They are coming from out of town. We are booked and they get mad because we can’t get them in. Maybe you should of called sooner
2280 2018-11-12 20:34:02 ive said it before & ill say it again, synthetic oil changes are a scam 

need to just do this shit my gahdamn self.
2281 2018-11-12 20:33:56 Warning: If you're eating lots of sugary, refined foods, they could be contributing to your breakouts. They don’t directly cause acne but they do exacerbate oil production on the face.
2282 2018-11-12 20:33:54 Great shots.  That one on the left is just SCREAMING to be turned into some beautiful oil painting of him sitting in that throne on a cloud somewhere
2283 2018-11-12 20:33:50 Wanna chef it up with some hamburger soup like the wifey I am but damn Harris oil pizza sounds good 
2284 2018-11-12 20:33:40 ...that’s totally not why. Can you imagine Fox’s advertisers and the GOP’s donors missing this chance to jump on driving messaging around voter suppression (FL/Koch bro’s) and climate change denial (CA fires/big oil). Something else is going on.
2285 2018-11-12 20:33:32 Unless they stop doing that, say hello to Oil trading below cost at $15 bucks or thereabouts.
2286 2018-11-12 20:33:23 Wowzers oil!!!
2287 2018-11-12 20:33:22 You're back AGAIN. I knew you were ANALYTICS guy by your comments. I'm a pure film guy. oil and water..fire and ice
2288 2018-11-12 20:33:20 Why haven't you punished Saudi Arabia for murdering an American journalist!  Buying Saudi oil is NOT putting America first.
2289 2018-11-12 20:33:02 Could we start using carrot seed oil instead.
Or am i fooling myself.
Start a trend.
2290 2018-11-12 20:32:50 So all off sudden everyone cares about palm oil... listen I am west African what do you think our stews are made off?
2291 2018-11-12 20:32:49 I am also in a financial bind for my medicine.

I use Hashish or hash oil exclusively because the flower cannot provide consistent relief.

4 years ago hash oil was $55 a gram. Three weeks ago I bought 10 grams of hash oil for $216.
Then that much hash oil would have been $550
2292 2018-11-12 20:32:43 Cont /4. Oil goes up to 70-80, but Venz almost zeroed, lybia catching up , Iran is great as well. All others super happy. But....us shale is above 10 mln and growing fast. And now trump is not happy with pricey oil-> gasoline. Need to do something!
2293 2018-11-12 20:32:36 Had mine done on Oct 11 before a trip to US, was in Nashville on Oct 26 and was told by the hair oil/straightener guy in the mall he could tell I'm lazy with my hair because of the roots!!! 
2294 2018-11-12 20:32:31 Remember at primary school when to accidentally start singing an extra ‘of kings’ at the end of Give Me Oil In My Lamp, was to bring shame on your family, your school and your whole country?
2295 2018-11-12 20:32:31 He has no empathy and he needs to stop messing around with free markets too. Feels like he comments on things like oil production for personal gain!
2296 2018-11-12 20:32:30 Ha! You can also mail order olive oil from the producer featured in the 1st episode of Salt Fat Acid Heat. Just saying.
2297 2018-11-12 20:32:27 oil collapse continues ….
2298 2018-11-12 20:32:21 Trump and his bloody tweets....

2299 2018-11-12 20:32:17 See it’s extremely hypocritical of the democrats to believe that they can control the weather. It’s the only thing they actually CANT control. So they control it by telling us we need to burn less fuel, tax gas, cars, oil etc, keep us from buying certain items & so on
2300 2018-11-12 20:32:11 But you told us that the supplements Alex Jones sells was snake oil
2301 2018-11-12 20:31:58 Butter and coconut oil! You need to mix a tbsp of each with coffee in a blender. It's called "Bullet proof coffee" i the keto community. I do this every morning. Love it!
2302 2018-11-12 20:31:57 Your sanctions against Iran are driving oil prices up. 

Don't criticize the Saudis either - they may ask for the $100m wired to you shortly after Khashoggi's murder back, or stop buying your apartments.

Isn't Saudi Arabia a country you claim to have no financial interests in?
2303 2018-11-12 20:31:56 $oil is looking really ugly.
2304 2018-11-12 20:31:54 USD strength is wounding new orders overseas.

Any 3% increase in USD, then foreign currency devaluation drops.  Crude oil and other US exports become more expensive.  If the USD does not drop a bit, future earnings will come short expectations, -discount future stock prices
2305 2018-11-12 20:31:50 $AMRN if your family doctor refuse to write a vascepa prescription worried about mineral oil spin, do you appreciate your doctor more or less?
2306 2018-11-12 20:31:49 But that's the problem though. If you ban it, you have to find alternatives. And there are no good alternatives. So we shouldn't ban it, like we shouldn't ban soybean oil or pineapple or whatever. We should get companies to source sustainable palm oil instead
2307 2018-11-12 20:31:44 isn't it cos they use the oil they fried the words with?
2308 2018-11-12 20:31:42 Oil down 11 days in a row. Some hedge fund imploding probably.
2309 2018-11-12 20:31:41 That’s great but when the government enforced a bill to limit oil transportation by rail, it makes no difference.
2310 2018-11-12 20:31:41 make you come add palm oil d next day 
2311 2018-11-12 20:31:36 Unsurprisingly, it looks like at some point I was preemptively blocked by this 
@RealWayneRoot huckster.  Snake oil salesmen and cultists don't operate well outside of their bubble.
2312 2018-11-12 20:31:34 You don't think this revolution has been going on for awhile ?   Seems to me, Nikola Tesla (and some other guys) were seriously blocked in favor of nuclear and oil. 
2313 2018-11-12 20:31:26 i got oil all over my jacket imma be pissed if i can’t get it out
2314 2018-11-12 20:31:21 Get wall street out of the oil business.
2315 2018-11-12 20:31:17 Well with Iran the costs of oil & gas prices will spike compliments of Trump.
2316 2018-11-12 20:31:16 @TheKindPen Hey. Im having a issue with my Kind pen slim oil auto draw. Whenever I go to hit my pen the light turns off in the middle of me hitting the pen. Its fully charged.
2317 2018-11-12 20:31:12 Oh I didn't know about it not producing it's own oil. Thank you. I noticed it gets irritated mostly after exfoliating, on other days it's ok
2318 2018-11-12 20:31:07 @JKCorden you have the power to help this cause! To people everywhere, stop using Palm oil products!!x
2319 2018-11-12 20:30:57 Palm oil is not bad. 

However some of the locations are bad (ie the destroying of orangutang habitats to create new plantations). 

Palm oil not only grown on these plantations (Indonesia).
2320 2018-11-12 20:30:52 I don't know either. But McDavid keeps us going - just imagine if Oil hadn't won the lottery? It'd be 1995 all over again.
2321 2018-11-12 20:30:48 Du menar han från Lundin oil? Där verkar det ju funnits jäkla många vuxna i styrelserummet.
2322 2018-11-12 20:30:47 @realDonaldTrump a industrial revolution is required for Wash and Ore state period. F plus rated tank farm in a large  earthquake and oil corps did 0 to fix. Either bring the pipeline from Canada or sign a order to have these fixed. No fuel no recovery sir.
2323 2018-11-12 20:30:38 Crude oil officially round-tripping the pathetic 2% rally on news of Saudi's measly 500,000 b/d production cut shows how weak the oil market truly is. Prepare for a significant slowdown in oil production growth in the shale patch. This is very bullish for nat gas.

2326 2018-11-12 20:30:21 It's not grandstanding and lecturing, it's raising awareness of where our 'stuff' comes from. He doesn't have to stop buying bacon or shampoo with palm oil.
2327 2018-11-12 20:30:14 i dont know how the situation is in germany, but i hear about really old bernina workhorses being discarded or sold for very cheap all the time. i have a sewing machine from around 1970 and it works great (after a quick touch up with oil and an old toothbrush)
2328 2018-11-12 20:30:12 have u looked into cbd oil?
2329 2018-11-12 20:30:06 The damn carbon tax in Alberta killed the oil industry. No pipelines were the final nails in the coffin.
2330 2018-11-12 20:30:03 You cut Iranian oil so that your Saudi killer prince can make more money and bomb more children in Jemen.
2331 2018-11-12 20:30:02 # HERE IS THE DEAL IF SOMEONE  OR SOMETHING IS NOT REAL IT WILL SOON SURFACE LIKE OIL & WATER ! SO IF DONALD J. TRUMP IS A FAILURE 4 THE USA THEN LET HIM FAIL ON HIS OWN MERITS ! WHY ARE PEOPLE DIGGING DITCHES 4 HIM IF HE IS A LOSER LIKE THEY DECLARE WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE LIARS !
2332 2018-11-12 20:29:58 Oh what a tosser honestly just CHECK labels and avoid products using palm oil... take ONE DAY from eating meat a week it’s not hard and it’s not a fucking lecture we’re trying to SAVE THE FUCKING PLANET
2333 2018-11-12 20:29:49 No you missed my point. If a country uses up all of it's sources of materials such as oil than what happens to that country?
2334 2018-11-12 20:29:42 Oil’s booming 
2335 2018-11-12 20:29:39 Typical Zimbabwean! I saw "black market" and almost made a dash for it only to realise its not our kind of black market and you are in London not Harare. Cooking oil running low, you see. Good luck on the event anyway.
2336 2018-11-12 20:29:29 Yeah that why was jarring me in kavos. But I realised water helped a lot aswell so I put a But in a spray bottle and added water. And I was using argan oil moose
2337 2018-11-12 20:29:15 What's happening in oil right now is mad scary.
2338 2018-11-12 20:29:12 We owe you not sending you in the first place over oil and Saudi interest.
2339 2018-11-12 20:29:03 It is a complex issue and as I interpret from the article it’s not as simple as banning palm oil from products but it’s a start. Always thought Greenpeace were a charity as well, not a political organisation
2340 2018-11-12 20:28:56 Me: Lol dumb pioneers thought snake oil could cure hysteria and lead poisoning

Also me: CBD will fix my broken leg
2341 2018-11-12 20:28:48 I know this feeling all too well. My hair makes my life a living hell unless I straighten it, then proceed to put oil into it and use a climate control hairspray. Otherwise it gets frizz happy and I look like a damn poodle.
2342 2018-11-12 20:28:41 I hesitate to argue against you, Tariq, because I do think the US should back off. But I don't think resource grabbing is anywhere near an adequate explanation for our behavior. It may contribute at the margins. 

@SteveBo43165335 : ISIS did try to finance itself by selling oil.
2343 2018-11-12 20:28:37 Ngaauye owanawo box re cooking oil after a win
2344 2018-11-12 20:28:34 I don't stink at all since I moved away from the shop bought 'normal' deodorants. I think they messed up my flora & fauna and made me smell! Coconut oil and bicarb work just beautifully and it is a no risk thing to do. Go easy on the bicarb if your skin is sensitive #ethicalhour
2345 2018-11-12 20:28:33 oil <$59
2346 2018-11-12 20:28:20 Should be moving away from oil!
2347 2018-11-12 20:28:19 Of course, sanctions on any country importing Iranian oil might be stressing market place. You think? And whose stupid idea was that?
2348 2018-11-12 20:28:13 Lol am not responsible for what you deduce or decipher, only responsible for what I tweet 
2349 2018-11-12 20:28:10 Have heard that they (and other rodents) hate the smell of peppermint. Try putting peppermint oil at their access points.
2350 2018-11-12 20:28:09 Chale..... my mind spoy'oil.
But I'm still keeping my fingers crossed.
It's not easy kraa
2351 2018-11-12 20:28:08 Venezuela is a third rate petro state. Their economy collapsed along with the price of oil. Russia is facing similar problems, just not as drastic. Alaskans get paid each year for their oil, socializing their resource. Don't see you griping about that.
2352 2018-11-12 20:28:00 I feel bad for you guys honestly with what you have to deal with cause people are either really dumb with cars but think they know or you get the assholes that are stuck in their ways with cars cause they don’t believe new cars can go longer for an oil change lmao
2353 2018-11-12 20:27:55 Your policies have been disrupting the stock market and oil prices for months now.
2354 2018-11-12 20:27:48 I've been thinking a lot about CBD oil after reading this -- like there's a specific substance that might or might not help many things & is mostly harmless. Ultimate placebo maybe.

2356 2018-11-12 20:27:37 This is how bad things have been for the oil market lately: U.S. crude oil prices just settled lower for the 11th straight day, the longest losing streak since WTI began trading in 1983.
2357 2018-11-12 20:27:31 Just get your tax return ready you slippery snake oil salesmen. The country wants transparency.
2358 2018-11-12 20:27:30 I'm out of $BP personal & riding $DWT to the moon. Don't know what oil stocks will do. I like $BP yield & price reset here but I want to short the barrels sitting on the docks in the Kingdom. With WMD crazy stupid leverage. IDK man $57 could bring a FIVER & that's the rip cord pt
2359 2018-11-12 20:27:30 It's Veterans day, so all postponed by one day....(oil inventory report out on Thursday)
2360 2018-11-12 20:27:27 Oh, Btw, There Are Several Of Those Among Us Whom Actually Are Experts On The Powers Of Snake Oil... and Disinformation, and You, Mr. Gorka, Are Walking a Fine Line Closer To The Latter. #WWG1WGA #HaveFaith
2361 2018-11-12 20:27:25 Cont /2. March 2016 - we did it, oil is down to 30$. Results - shale output down from 10.4 to 9 Mln bpd. Many shale producers in restructuring, but limited went bankrupt. Meanwhile Venz and Lybia out of game, but Iran is ramping market share
2362 2018-11-12 20:27:24 DARLINGTON: Take care at the intersection of Abercrombie St and Cleveland St following an earlier motorcycle crash that has spilled oil on the road. Emergency crews are on site.
2363 2018-11-12 20:27:22 Soooo ... the other day I accidentally mixed eucalyptus with menthol instead of lavender with the menthol. I was making arnica balm. Today, I took the eucalyptus and menthol and added some orange essential oil and made soap. 
It smells .... invigorating! 
Now what to call it??
2364 2018-11-12 20:27:13 What a intraday reversal! Her comes your 58$ scenario, $XLE $XOP everything in the oil sector puked ...
2365 2018-11-12 20:27:08 Looking at my old elementary school atlas. It was published in ‘57 (they didn’t update books often in NB, apparently!). A few fun facts: YEG was much bigger than YYC; no oil yet in Fort Mac; agriculture was 3x larger sector than oil & gas; meat packing was larger than refining!
2366 2018-11-12 20:27:00 Oil change got my baby flyin 
2367 2018-11-12 20:26:57 We've got something similar up here in Washington with the fishing boats. People who do that have massive amounts of time off, unpaid, but their pay while working is really high, and of course they don't use much of it while on the boat.

2370 2018-11-12 20:26:39 Totally agree. Palm oil is in loads of things. We managed without it before we can again. We have to stop this destruction!!

2375 2018-11-12 20:26:26 S/o to the guys who changed my oil  hooked it with a discount for some bud lol
2376 2018-11-12 20:26:24 Snake oil.
2377 2018-11-12 20:26:21 Having a Car has thought me that you just can’t be cute and drive it forever & not do oil change, check tires & spend a wicked amount of money on gas to take you places .  

I be forgetting that cars need maintenance too   #Girlproblem
2378 2018-11-12 20:26:18 But the USA is one of the biggest producers of oil.
2379 2018-11-12 20:25:58 Your Iranian gambit is screwing up Big Oil.
2380 2018-11-12 20:25:48 That’s going to piss off big oil in Texas, u might want to retract that.
2381 2018-11-12 20:25:45 I have been by voting palm oil for years. We shouldn't be distroying our planet for greed and not only becuase we need all our rainforest baisens as they are our planets lungs.

2388 2018-11-12 20:25:28 Have you missed the army that they have raised through the propaganda? All of those traitorous pseudo-Nazis slicking their “pride” down with gun oil?
2389 2018-11-12 20:25:26 That silent killer ‘palm oil’ that’s in basically everything we consume, it’s scary
2390 2018-11-12 20:25:13 Y’all really weren’t gonna tell me, vehicles needed an oil change regularly. Aight I see y’all
2391 2018-11-12 20:25:07 If Q is snake oil why are you putting so much effort into it. We have California on fire, lives lost, total devastation and the election being stolen from we the people. I say what’s wrong with this picture? Snake oil salesman.

2396 2018-11-12 20:24:47 who said i took it after i did the oil change ? maybe i took it before. or maybe i wiped my hands first, 
2397 2018-11-12 20:24:41 Saudi Arabia's planned cuts in oil production also revived concerns of a global slowdown.
2398 2018-11-12 20:24:36 Amin
2399 2018-11-12 20:24:30 The oil sands are a stranded asset, highly carbon inefficient & turning into a Canadian taxpayers' burden.
2400 2018-11-12 20:24:19 Great stuff. Seen other footage about bird migration and oil platforms/ rigs that was also interesting.
2401 2018-11-12 20:24:12 Fresh up out the shower. All I need now is someone to put this oil in my beard. 
2402 2018-11-12 20:24:04 Leave him bai sansu bane
2403 2018-11-12 20:24:00 US is all about acquiring resources be it oil or natural gas, whether legitimately or by regime change
2404 2018-11-12 20:23:57 Which is understandable. But a lot of people complain that they have to pay for the oil change if they prefer it every 5k and our Toyota Care only covers an oil change every 10k and tire rotation every 5k

2407 2018-11-12 20:23:38 The best solution for these problems caused by the same industry is for their government to really have a strict implementation on laws addressing the responsibilities of the said industry. Kay murag gi basta2 raman sad sa palm oil industry ilang government.
2408 2018-11-12 20:23:36 Thanks to rising oil prices, @YPFoficial, #Argentina's national oil company, expects a profitable fiscal year and expanding proved reserves, according to a new report by @reorg.
2409 2018-11-12 20:23:34 Oil is so high as you have put sanction on iran
2410 2018-11-12 20:23:28 Why cant US producers have a stable domestic price and a different export price.  Of course be able to build refineries to produce gas with oil here and not have to import.
2411 2018-11-12 20:23:26 i jst saw a eco styling gel w. cannabis oil in it whaaaaat
2412 2018-11-12 20:23:26 They are and they don't negotiate via Twitter. They use money and leverage. Besides the US is a net exporter - surplus. Why don't we lower prices ourselves? The oil lobby, money, votes etc. And you're now neck deep in the new swamp you made.
2413 2018-11-12 20:23:22 $CL_F
Oil getting quite a reversal here. Look out below!
2414 2018-11-12 20:23:22 TRUMP: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
2415 2018-11-12 20:23:21 Since the initiative failed, I don't see any impact. Had to passed, some of our donors with personal investments probably would have stayed on, but getting oil and gas sponsors would be much more challenging. They love giving to youth development and education initiatives.

2418 2018-11-12 20:23:13 ty for teaching me that olive oil is NOT seasoning. my mentor
2419 2018-11-12 20:23:10 Alibaba did $30.8 billion in sales on a single day.
J.D did &19 billion in sales on a single day.
Thats almost $50 billion more than Nigeria makes from crude oil sale in a year ..
Naija is poor jor
2420 2018-11-12 20:23:02 #Brent Crude Now Under $70 at $69,78 (+0.24%) a barrel. (One month ago $86,71 a barrel) 

US President Donald Trump in a Tweet: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia, Russia,and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. 

Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
2421 2018-11-12 20:22:56 Oil is a huge part of this economy. Wishing for low prices is suicide. Saudi Arabia the entire Middle East for that matter has been trying to run the United States out of the oil constantly. These lower prices can very much allow them to bankrupt us.

2423 2018-11-12 20:22:54 I feel I have won the day because I managed to reign in my sweet tooth around freshly baked cookies while waiting for an oil change and the mountains of candy and holiday shit at the store. If only I could have this kind of self-control everyday. But what fun would that be?
2424 2018-11-12 20:22:51 So are the oil companies here in the US gouging the American consumer? All while collecting the HUGE tax cuts you gave them?
2425 2018-11-12 20:22:43 Go to US Business owners and tell them, or ask them, what the F? they are doing? They are leaving dollars on the table, because they think They are getting a great deal.  Paper Plastics Oil, its all the same, they go out for drinks & get screwed.
2426 2018-11-12 20:22:39 LOL.  His avi is of a video game character..
2427 2018-11-12 20:22:38 much is made of electric batteries yet its still a raw material mined from the ground, just moving the problem from oil to another mineral. in time will have the same problem as oil, runs out.
Fuel cell is the way forward. BP R already looking into fuel cell as a long term future

2429 2018-11-12 20:22:33 Wonder how many bet on an oil bounce purely on the fact it's never had X down days in a row?

2433 2018-11-12 20:22:10 Aye agree Michael but the time for coming on twitter complaining has gone time @theSNP  stepped up and done the right thing as WM couldnt give a toss about Scotland and never will till the oil runs out #indyref2
2434 2018-11-12 20:22:05 When we're near the price of oil so high, if it's just too glitchy and buggy to have to figure if it has been?!
2435 2018-11-12 20:22:05 Check out how they serve their people. How they treat women, gays , people with different opinions!!! The west is trying to drag them to the 21st century.!! Ffs! What don’t you get! The oil  bullshit is Saudi bollox to cause friction and conflict. Looks like u signed up.
2436 2018-11-12 20:22:05 #Brent Consumer (Diesel) Prices in The Netherlands, compared with a somewhat risen US-Dollar, should be down at least 20 cents at around €1,20 liter (current €1,39 on avarage). Oil prices at the pump are often manipulated by oil companies and state governments.
2437 2018-11-12 20:22:04 I took my car for an oil change bc it was 3000+ miles overdue. My husband’s and my work bag and helmet were in the car and the maintenance worker assumed we were military and paid for our oil change. I appreciate Military supporters bc your support DOES make a difference 
2438 2018-11-12 20:21:56 The body shop doent sell any product containing palm oil. Quite a few companies stopped using palm oil in their products when it first came to light what was happening to the rainforests years ago.

2440 2018-11-12 20:21:53 What happened to sticking with American products? Where's the giant increase in American oil production? I thought we didn't need any other nation to get by in the United States, eh?
2441 2018-11-12 20:21:51 oil and parm. no duck.
2442 2018-11-12 20:21:50 Let's keep our CBD oil and cannabis biz in America.  Let big pharma use Canada as their exit strategy.  We don't need em turning tail and looking to exploit us with Cannabis in the name of Canada.  They are fat enough on our milk
2443 2018-11-12 20:21:48 Thanks your Iran sanctions, Saudi Arabia has no important competitor anymore. You made oil prices go high.
2444 2018-11-12 20:21:43 Time to give away our sovereign wealth fund to the oil and gas industry

2451 2018-11-12 20:20:52 it’s basically just 100% tea tree oil.  the body works brand is holy grail for me but hopefully you do try it and is successful for you!
2452 2018-11-12 20:20:40 Negligible oil comes from Saudi Arabia anyway. Move on, dummy.

2465 2018-11-12 20:19:30 Is he still a thing??? Lol
2466 2018-11-12 20:19:20 And also brand repositioning. I’ve never thought of them as having high (or any) principles or even of having any nutrition in what they sell.  It will be interesting to see if they stop using palm oil products.
2467 2018-11-12 20:19:10 Seems to me you blamed Poo resident Obama for high oil prices when he was in office. So aren't you then responsible,  Donnie?
2468 2018-11-12 20:19:06 Yay! We hope you love this oil! Thank you for sharing!
2469 2018-11-12 20:18:58 Will we see another 15% to 20% downside for oil stocks, or are we almost at an oil stocks bottom?

2473 2018-11-12 20:18:37 OIL PRICES are largely driven by structural influences rather than personalities. The market cycles between periods of over- and under-supply not because policymakers keep repeating mistakes but because they make same choices when confronted with the same deep structural factors
2474 2018-11-12 20:18:37 We’ve seen how rapidly the US’s amazing independent oil and gas producers have responded to $60+ oil ... catapulting  US to #1 oil producer in < 5 years!  Between our own soaring levels plus those from Canada & Mexico, we’ll need <1MM B/day of non N American crude in 2019!

Showing once again that he doesn't know anything about a lot of things which, as President, he should, Trump praised low oil prices while US producers slowed production and laid off workers. Trump is a moron.
2478 2018-11-12 20:18:34 I was really not expecting to have a day where the portfolio seemed to be effected by the President threatening OPEC over oil prices.
2479 2018-11-12 20:18:24     The High Dollar & Wage Growth Plus Diminishing Global Economy is hurting the Stock Market. Especially Tech & Financials

2482 2018-11-12 20:18:23 By that logic you should ask toddlers how many points mom and dad have on their license, what their driving record is like, when was the last time the tires were rotated, oil changes, maintenance records, seatbelts, texting while driving....That’s your lane too. 
2483 2018-11-12 20:18:10 I stand by my $100 oil call. 
Cheap oil at this time in an incentive for war. #2018
2484 2018-11-12 20:18:05 Well now that we have the tape of the Khashoggis dismemberment while alive tape but are telling the world he was strangled(cannot scream while being strangled) you can forever use your cover sorry as low oil price leverage. But I thought we did not use Saudi oil anymore/ smh
2485 2018-11-12 20:18:00 I have a distinct memory of food shopping with a friend and her pointing out this little symbol on products which referred to their palm oil content. She let me know that those symbols meant, literally, dead orangutans. Never looked at those products the same way. Kudos Iceland.
2486 2018-11-12 20:17:57 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for gem healing, and put some smoke essential oil in my diffuser.
2487 2018-11-12 20:17:54 WE LOWERED IT INTO A STEEL BUCKET FULL OF HOT OIL WITH A FISHING POLE TAPED TO A BROOMSTICK....
2488 2018-11-12 20:17:40 YEAH! Why are Republicans so mad? They've had it their way and every way they can have it. And yet, they're still NEVER satisfied. I think we need to dose them with Castor Oil. :)
2489 2018-11-12 20:17:37 It's only banned and considered too political becuase the big companies with their money in palm oil! Money rules the media and thus the world. And if the money don't care about the world's future then they will stop anything that will damage the investments.

2497 2018-11-12 20:17:03 Taking fossil fuels out of the equation = starving humans in bare feet. Cycleways, bicycles, and the food needed to power them is 100% dependent on oil, coal , and CH4, OR for the thicko's (politicians, MSM etc) = CO2 production.  ho hum, dummies
2498 2018-11-12 20:17:02 Oil and water, stranger to each other
2499 2018-11-12 20:17:02 Since when are you interested in how Saudis deal with oil prices? You only talk and talk about it but when its getting hard like in the Kashoggi case you suddenly blindly accept everything they say...do you really think we don't know about your financial ties there???
2500 2018-11-12 20:17:01 I’m waiting to get my oil changed and I just burnt the fuck out of my finger with my cigarette lighter because I’m a dumbass
2501 2018-11-12 20:17:01 No that’s not why the Dow is down. You just make shit up don’t you? Decreasing oil prices, the Saudis cutting production movement into safer investments. None of it has to do with harassing the idiot in the White House
2502 2018-11-12 20:17:00 POTUS has exempted India from any sanctions even though they have violated Iran sanctions & those for purchases of Russian arms. & other countries have also been exempted who buy the most oil from Iran. How is this supposed to hurt Iran ?. This is no different than Obama
2503 2018-11-12 20:16:58 So would I be, if I had everyone else's oil.
2504 2018-11-12 20:16:42 Maybe true, but it doesn't change that the oil sands is one of the dirtiest and most expensive oil sources in the world.
2505 2018-11-12 20:16:40 Freezing in the bowl when the oil heat goes out and you have to have a fish funeral by dumping his body down into a ravine?
2506 2018-11-12 20:16:33 Forget oil for a sec and mention legalizing marijuana. Let the industry flourish like canada and soon mexico.
2507 2018-11-12 20:16:32 The cause is great, essential and critical. But should it be hijacked for commercial gain by a company who continue to sell palm oil products? Seems highly cynical, opportune & disingenuous. But incredible value for money in driving brand awareness.
2508 2018-11-12 20:16:22 $SPY $QQQ $DIA Market sell is so strong. Expecting an epic drop tomorrow. Crude Oil literally died.
2509 2018-11-12 20:16:22 you should shout about this as many people see palm oil and avoid at all costs

2522 2018-11-12 20:15:23 Interestingly enough most observers and PM enthusiasts consider 2001-2011 a complete bull cycle for gold. But that is obviously false, as Gold underperformed oil and commodities during the first 8 years. The actual bull market started after 2008 and has mostly gone unnoticed.
2523 2018-11-12 20:15:20 It should be higher on the contrary. Pump your own damn oil Trumpy Bear 
2524 2018-11-12 20:15:18 BTC is the standard like the $. The reason it's not volatile is because it's manipulated & not backed by the gold standard as was in the past.

If Saudi Arabia decided to quote & trade oil using their currency you'd get a small glimpse of how manipulated the dollar is.
2525 2018-11-12 20:15:18 I can put lotion+oil on , come outside & my shits ashy like I ain’t put nothing on

2527 2018-11-12 20:15:13 let me guess - Eric shorted oil futures?
2528 2018-11-12 20:15:12 Oil price is way down, Putin is not happy. Dollar is strong, Fed is still planning to raise rate, which can push dollar stronger. Strong dollars offset tariffs, and hurt US multi nationals. Can’t figure out what’s going on here.
2529 2018-11-12 20:15:12 Why is the US exporting oil? That is a military strategic asset.  And a limited resource.
2530 2018-11-12 20:15:07 I would definitely salute him with it! So, what specifically can Trump do to directly affect what a barrel of oil should cost? Bitte Erzählen Sie mir, Herr Doktor Schöman.
2531 2018-11-12 20:15:06 just scrub it out with a nail brush with some soap, anything that's just oil based should pose no serious trouble.
2532 2018-11-12 20:14:58 And now you're an oil expert? Go away now, as it's soon to become reality! IMPEACH!!!
2533 2018-11-12 20:14:47 Do you think cheap oil will make us forget Saudi are murderers?
2534 2018-11-12 20:14:47 Actually idiot, oil should be much higher, supply is far lower than broadcasted
2535 2018-11-12 20:14:41 @simonjbridges, could you please tell us if Ben Guerin is still a @NZNationalParty Parliamentary staffer and if his @nzenergyvoices oil & gas propaganda site is funded by the Nats' Parliamentary budget? #askingpolitely
2536 2018-11-12 20:14:40 Yep. I am still stuck on the fact that this is the best chia and TM can do. What upside is there in keeping them? We know nothing will change and the season will be decided by December.
2537 2018-11-12 20:14:34 And I’m oil up oil up oil up in a BANQ wit da funnii face !

2546 2018-11-12 20:13:56 @IcelandFoods Absolute kudos on the success of sharing your animation and raising awareness on palm oil. And I love that they tried to ban it, yet it's more successful than ever. And the icing on the cake is that you during have to pay advertising fees

2552 2018-11-12 20:13:38 Echinacea - herb you consume can get at any local whole foods store and eucalyptus oil - rub into your skin and utilize the sinus points on your face as well as your lymph node tract on your head/neck (google is a bestie for those points lol)
2553 2018-11-12 20:13:35 After watching The #IcelandChristmasAdvert about the poor #rangtan I want to try and stop buying any unsustainable palm oil products. @TRESemmeUKI @GarnierUK @LorealElvive can you confirm if you have any palm oil free shampoo and conditioners please? #palmoil

2559 2018-11-12 20:13:20 RIP Stan Lee

Before Stan Lee, comic books were drawn on stone, using oil paint. They were very hard trade and collect. If Stan Lee had not invented paper and ink, we'd have no superheros left.
2560 2018-11-12 20:13:16 They don't want to solve our power sector because of thier oil well's, personal gain  selfish leaders.
2561 2018-11-12 20:13:11 My skin is even naturally oily. Can't leave my house looking like a creamed with palm oil, abeg.
2562 2018-11-12 20:13:07 No creating a civil war because of a few hundred protesters to overthrow a government so you can keep oil prices High that created an environment hostile 2 our Embassy and Americans that we will be suffering repercussions from four decades
 that's much more important

"The sign on the mechanic’s wall clearly stated that engraving durability charms on engines was not a replacement for checking the oil."
2565 2018-11-12 20:12:54 We need to make it clear 
Calgary 1988 was first hatched in booming 1979 and its bid prevailed in 1981 before global oil prices cratered. 
Proponents are saying we were in a recession when we bid (that is false)
2566 2018-11-12 20:12:53 I live under one person, one vote and 95% of Canada's  national elections are called before the polls even close in the west which is 32% of our total population. This includes Alberta (98% Oil reserves). It's like they don't even exist, until Liberals go to fill their car up.
2567 2018-11-12 20:12:51 @pepboysauto Transaction ID#2207519, Store 0814.  Dropped car off for oil change on 11.10, Shop had vehicle all day, stated they would also perform routine inspection, I stated there was a leak too, and too look at possible turning indicator light replacements.
2568 2018-11-12 20:12:49 All down to HSBC having money invested in Palm Oil companies & shares in Clearcast. See RT below.
2569 2018-11-12 20:12:38 I could blame my oil change technician at Midas for MNLARS - don't mean it's true.

He's a down and out has been never was. Throw him in the discarded "rubber stamp" pile.
2570 2018-11-12 20:12:30 Lol bragging about working like a slave. Only in America.
2571 2018-11-12 20:12:21 Taab
2572 2018-11-12 20:12:19 The chorus of voices demanding an outright ban on #PalmOil, appear to overlook the requirement to replace it with another plant-based oil ingredient.
@IcelandFoods isn't calling for a ban, it's calling for this extraordinarily productive & useful plant to be grown sustainably.
2573 2018-11-12 20:12:19 Trump hopes OPEC Daniel Sturridge't cut production, says oil prices should be lower
2574 2018-11-12 20:12:17 Can’t let a nigga like me with 5.7L Hemi get an oil change, I’m racing errbody!! 
2575 2018-11-12 20:12:16 If you have sensitive #skin try #natural or organic products. Never use soap on your face as it is too drying. I use an organic oil to keep my skin supple. The oil gives you the opportunity to massage into the skin while cleansing at the same time. Think more about your skin.
2576 2018-11-12 20:12:13 Ridiculous. US blocks oil exports from Russia Venezuela and Iran and what? Trump is crazy or lying.
2577 2018-11-12 20:12:09 If the Saudi government stopped oil exports,, the hole world would be technologically demolished
2578 2018-11-12 20:12:03 Now if home heating oil would take a dive, I'd like to fill my tank.

2581 2018-11-12 20:11:54 Lol Oga u no go fit do d deals  involved
2582 2018-11-12 20:11:53 I just had an old man offer to pay for my oil change, and then continue to say if I needed to borrow any I could. What is life. Why I turn him down.
2583 2018-11-12 20:11:50 It's new and super affordable ! The composition of their products looks great. Rosehip oil serum. Hyaluronic acid serum. Retinol serum etc. it's super cheap and the reviews all looks good that's why i'm wondering.
2584 2018-11-12 20:11:35 If you say so Chief, no doubt you're as big an expert on Oil as you are on the Stock Market, Health Care and running a Casino.
Last I heard  Oil was on a free market, just like your Real Estate, betting you won't be saying rents should be lower. Remain silent and thought a fool.
2585 2018-11-12 20:11:28 Oil trade can continue, but after 10-1-2019 the payments will have to be made to the transitional government @Control_Risks @tradewindsnews
2586 2018-11-12 20:11:20 And can people please read ingredients panel's? How many know palm oil can be in the daily loaf of bread?
2587 2018-11-12 20:11:18 #fishoil anyone have experience of taking fish oil for arthritis, does it help?
2588 2018-11-12 20:11:14 How about getting the President that you support so much to cut the chatter about lowering oil prices.  We just got back on our feet here.

2595 2018-11-12 20:10:39 Kenyans our transport woes are just about to get worse..Saudi Arabia and opec are cutting oil production leading to a spike in oil prices alafu ifike Kenya @UKenyatta aongeze hiyo tax yake ole wetu!!!! Father Lord!!! #MatatuCrackdown
2596 2018-11-12 20:10:37 Tiny, have you looked at oil prices lately?  They’re as low as they’ve been in 8 months. Indicates slowing global economies, which your tariffs have contributed to.

2601 2018-11-12 20:09:55 Its great to raise awareness about environmental issues and food sustainability, but an outright ban on palm oil is not the answer. These are all the problems with @IcelandFoods banned Christmas advert #Rangtan

2604 2018-11-12 20:09:53 Yellow bottle! It has Shea butter, olive oil, and black castor oil.
2605 2018-11-12 20:09:47 The problem is the discount. We sell oil in the $20 range, discounted ftom the $60 range of WTI. We could do just fine with the price being somewhat lower than it is at present, if we had a pipeline to tidewater. Trudeau is the problem here. Not Trump.
2606 2018-11-12 20:09:32 How about cleaning up all your poorly capped oil wells as a start.
2607 2018-11-12 20:09:32 I got Chamomile essential oil for my diffuser I’m going to sleep like a baby tonight 
2608 2018-11-12 20:09:28 Its important to me which is why i want the pipeline because puttinh all that oil on trains is very inefficient which causes more pollution
2609 2018-11-12 20:09:26 Oil prices are already too low.
2610 2018-11-12 20:09:26 No, but I'm sure he's given a few...
2611 2018-11-12 20:09:14 - Does whining count?
2612 2018-11-12 20:09:10 So I’m getting my oil changed and a bird hit the garage door and died :’)
2613 2018-11-12 20:09:02 @SecPompeo When are we going to stop buying oil from Vnzla.? Maduro uses that cash to buy loyalty from the army, to keep his followers happy and to make sure all of their needs are met. American $$ from Vnzla.’s  oil sales don’t benefit the people, rather it benefits the regime.
2614 2018-11-12 20:09:01 UAE was formed and modelled after our 1963 constitution. Malaysia came here to pick our oil palm seed. Brazil came here to pick our banana sucker.

Today they are global players while Nigeria is at the edge of precipice.
Bad leadership and docile followership

Smear oil on your glasses
Now when you look in the mirror blemishes and wrinkles are gone
2617 2018-11-12 20:08:45 Because bright eyes Trudeau killed Energy East so we can't get western Canadian oil to eastern Canada.
2618 2018-11-12 20:08:44 If the star part of the screw is reasonably intact then WD40 (or penetrating oil) with repeated dosing, and then using a Torx bit with tighten, loosen, tighten, loosen. Always try and avoid a flat blade screwdriver if you can. Swearing helps a lot!
2619 2018-11-12 20:08:43 @realDonaldTrump Now Russia is inciting Saudi Arabia to reduce output to increase price of oil in order to weaken yr plan of Iran ban!Tell OPEC to see that international price stabilize at $70 and not more as USA will get pressure for Iran oil import by some countries
2620 2018-11-12 20:08:39 #rheadd Social media allows personalized ads to infiltrate certain filter bubbles, and I believe this is what makes them so effective. Their success comes from targeting specific demographics, like marketing Krill Oil toward women above the age of 45, and spreading from there.
2621 2018-11-12 20:08:31 Hi Emma! Sorry for the late reply  Retinol first and then oil xx
2622 2018-11-12 20:08:31 I´m really hoppless that Donald Trump can get the oil prize down. He can do this gallant!

2625 2018-11-12 20:07:47 Hopefully you will abandon reliance on dirty foreign oil and focus on American oil.

2628 2018-11-12 20:07:37 Get the oil out there, it will not be allowed as a fuel in a few short years!
2629 2018-11-12 20:07:37 Unfortunately, that statement is accurate...on both fronts.
2630 2018-11-12 20:07:37 Happy Monday!

2631 2018-11-12 20:07:36 Wouldn’t it be nice if we weren’t reliant on Saudi Arabia for oil. 
And a Real President NOT abetting a Saudi cover up.. 
In normal times that’s considered treason kind of like your personal relationship with Russia......
2632 2018-11-12 20:07:33 America is #1 in oil production ranging from 6.3 billion to 10.5 billion in one year with that amount of production the planet will be too hot to live on by 2040 THATS IN 22 years ladies and gentlemen please take these last days we have to love one another,PLEASE!!
2633 2018-11-12 20:07:28 Samp with Vaseline because we didn't have cooking oil at home.  I used Vaseline as a substitute product.
2634 2018-11-12 20:07:26 If we’re ever in the same area I’ll totally do your makeup for you lol but the smashbox one I think was like photo finish or something but Idk, I’ll check. The Clinique one I have is oil control so you don’t need that one. Either way I recommend at least topping it w/ powder lol
2635 2018-11-12 20:07:17 He has no cap room because is is a bad GM. This isn’t a one off, he did the same thing in Boston.
2636 2018-11-12 20:07:16 They are really good! I was super surprised. I thought to look up recipies once when I accidentally out to much avocado in a protein shake and it became like a frosting/batter and sure enough, there are lots of substitutes for baking used avocado as the fat/oil substitute!
2637 2018-11-12 20:07:13 I just need somebody to come oil my scalp right now. It's killing me
2638 2018-11-12 20:07:08 I ran out of my krill oil capsules a while ago, but bought a new bottle this past weekend. After only one or two days, my right eye is leaking stuff from its oil glands. WTF.
2639 2018-11-12 20:06:53 OPEC s goal: sell as much oil as possible
2640 2018-11-12 20:06:48 Guess I'll get my oil change this week cause I need it
2641 2018-11-12 20:06:45 Pick up some Echinacea and eucalyptus oil girl and you’ll be golden 
2642 2018-11-12 20:06:38 If they cut oil production they are essentially punishing American citizens at the pump.  If they move forward we should cut all funding and protection to every Country that is involved.  Doesn’t Kuwait owe us billions for the US saving them?
2643 2018-11-12 20:06:28 oh shIT i almost forgot my cooking oil is about to run out

that was close. you almost got me there rice cookers...
2644 2018-11-12 20:06:22 why? because the US have tons of stuff to negotiate with.

What do Palestinians still have to negotiate with? land? sea? oil? foreign investments? everything is taken.
2645 2018-11-12 20:06:17 Sorry Jake but putting it back is not the answer. Some countries need palm oil production to fund workers, education, conservation etc. Google RSPO. It’s like all farming. Done right it works and is sustainable. #RSPO
2646 2018-11-12 20:06:13 Capital Economics: recent crude #oil & #gasoline price slump means US headline CPI inflation could fall well below 2% for most of '19; but lower prices would also provide a small boost to real GDP growth, so temporary #inflation undershoot won’t stop #Fed from continuing to hike
2647 2018-11-12 20:06:12 Obama a snake oil salesman!

2650 2018-11-12 20:06:09 Then the problem you get with the sugar tax is companies will just use more palm oil cos it's cheap  which is even worse for the environment-catch 22!
2651 2018-11-12 20:06:01 More importantly, the rest of the world knows the TRUTH of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi as well as who is responsible. @realDonaldTrump protects the Saudis for his own personal benefits. There s/b sanctions, undo the weapons deal and America can use its own oil
2652 2018-11-12 20:06:00 Yes it is called Shit stirrer!
2653 2018-11-12 20:05:57 He can't help it he was born with that silver spoon wedged so far up his ass you couldn't pry it out with an oil rig driller.
2654 2018-11-12 20:05:52 You’d better be talking about him. U.S has received foreign aid for the U.N, oil companies, water filtering, agriculture, medicine, armed forces, just to name a few, via money, brain power and/or labour esp in wake of crisis. It’s a simple web search to prove
2655 2018-11-12 20:05:51 @oil_shaeikh Oga we need some of that oil money ! 
2656 2018-11-12 20:05:51 Getting this oil change. Ugh I want to keep on sleeping
2657 2018-11-12 20:05:49 What’s a good oil or something for men’s  beards help me lol ?
2658 2018-11-12 20:05:46 This amazing vintage lounge chair will be displayed in the newly redesigned  BIGGBY headquarters that unveils this month. Tip...coconut oil will shine up old dull leather. This was so much fun.
2659 2018-11-12 20:05:40 $AMRN shorts are going to have to contend with more positive headlines, upgrades, conference in London this week, more docs jumping on board, script numbers increasing, and BO chatter. You can only beat the debunked mineral oil drum for so long. Good luck shorts!

2661 2018-11-12 20:05:17 Whenever I change my oil I do my best to recreate the scene from when I used to work at a quick lube. 

I chug black coffee, chain smoke cigarettes, spill hot oil on myself, and try to get my meth-head neighbor to heckle me.
2662 2018-11-12 20:05:12 The way you know this is political, even ignoring Greenpeace’s involvement, is that to change palm oil deforestation, you’d need to lobby various governments and change several laws.
2663 2018-11-12 20:05:05 fish oil didn't do much for fish either
2664 2018-11-12 20:05:04 what the hell difference does it make if the US has so much oil ? or does the nwo control our oil too ?
2665 2018-11-12 20:05:01 Come see the awesome lands recovered by the oil sands clean up project.
2666 2018-11-12 20:05:00 @Oil_Drop Possible that the best Oiler strategy today is to keep rowing and keep bailing. but to do it that way is another serious test of fan patience.
2667 2018-11-12 20:04:53 well, my approach is: use what you have already bought. it would be insane not to. and then start looking elsewhere as that finishes (E45 might be a good alternative, and they don’t list palm oil as an ingredient but i’m waiting to hear from them).
2668 2018-11-12 20:04:46 The British have always promoted war and instability in the Middle East to retain influence over oil. The quid pro quo is worldwide radical islam. I'd rather walk.
2669 2018-11-12 20:04:44 If history has shown us anything, it's that politicians peddling uber-nationalism, bigotry, scapegoating, xenophobia and intolerance will find a receptive audience when the putative "left" has nothing to offer but elitism, snake oil and stale platitudes.
2670 2018-11-12 20:04:44 ”He (God) has sent Me (Messiah Jesus) to bind up the brokenhearted, proclaim freedom for the captives, release from darkness, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve to bestow a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning” (Isa 61:1-3)

2673 2018-11-12 20:04:27 city has oil money but United are worth 4.2 billion dollars equal to the Dallas Cowboys as the most valuable sports team in the world. United have the most world wide supporters than any sports team in the world. We have the money and assets to compete with the top clubs.
2674 2018-11-12 20:04:20 Climate change all though should be measured in hundreds of years or more has been completed caused by Trumps 19 months in office along with Hurricanes a temporary rise in oil etc. Imagine if this fool actually had to take blame for his own incompetence
2675 2018-11-12 20:04:11 Hope that makes you feel better...somehow
2676 2018-11-12 20:04:09 We should be developing renewable energy sources and getting off oil. Solve LOTS of problems.
2677 2018-11-12 20:04:05 If they do, you have to take it as a threat and you have my total permission to evacuate the Saudi peninsula and make the world's largest parking lot / oil refinery outta the place.

2679 2018-11-12 20:04:01 WTI Crude Oil $USO finished -0.5% lower to 59.84 bbl after President Donald Trump Tweeted his thoughts on OPEC's plan to reduce supply. The President said, "Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting Oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply."
2680 2018-11-12 20:03:56 Why don’t you protect oil & gas industry as much as you protect steel. For you, energy independence is not related to national security but steel industry is. You believe arms cannot be made without national steel but they can run without national energy. Interesting logic!
2681 2018-11-12 20:03:48 Nectarine nincumpoop tweeted that he hopes Saudi Arabia & OPEC don’t cut oil production, but no mention that the Crown Prince & The Saudi Arabia Royal family should do justice to Jamal Khashoggi’s family. Fucking disgusting by carrot Caligula!

2684 2018-11-12 20:03:39 Obviously you did not pay attention to economics class in college you dimwit. The Saudi's price oil according to the political realities they wish to pursue.
2685 2018-11-12 20:03:39 Then we should be able to get off foreign oil/crude etc. but we aren’t and won’t for the foreseeable future.

2698 2018-11-12 20:02:32 It’s too late the palm oil plantations have been mushrooming since the 80s. If you want to save orangutans get them adopted by truckers
2699 2018-11-12 20:02:31 Able to get down and dirty HAHAHA. Everyone should be able to change their oil, if you think you need to document every single step of the process ur asking for attention- negative or positive
2700 2018-11-12 20:02:29 Now I understand why you dont care about their butchering a journalist, dissolving his bits in acid, then lying to the global community about it. Because of almighty oil.
2701 2018-11-12 20:02:27 If not You can Always  Invade another oil country !!!
2702 2018-11-12 20:02:23 Check out #HSBC re there investment in Palm oil
2703 2018-11-12 20:02:20 Sorry for the ignorance but what's the issue with palm oil or u gonna make me go and research this now!?!
2704 2018-11-12 20:02:01 Use either chickpeas cooked from dried or drained tinned chickpeas. Toss in oil and dried  herbs. Then roast for about 15-20mins. I sometimes roast in chilli and garlic too 
2705 2018-11-12 20:02:01 No guys. He found out positively what SA did to Khashoggi, he knows he has to punish them but he doesn’t want too. He wants us to want the oil more so we won’t force him.
2706 2018-11-12 20:01:56 Sasa dada oil chafu

2709 2018-11-12 20:01:49 I think the oil price is very low and need to reach above 80 $
2710 2018-11-12 20:01:46 Pernah jg kayak gini. Waktu itu lagi pusing trs gw olesin freshcare di kening gw, sambil nonton yutup jg, trs gw mau bersihin muka pake cleansing oil, krn keasikan nonton jd gasadar abis pake freshcare, alhasil semuka langsung panas njerr
2711 2018-11-12 20:01:44 Ummmnnn. Oil is a fungible commodity we can't ever develop enough to effect pricing. What you just said betrays any understanding of the world oil market and is basically wrong. The only way to reduce the influence of the world oil market is to find replacements.
2712 2018-11-12 20:01:33 Let me know when you’re done with your oil change then! I’m off at 3! And yeah, I figured 
2713 2018-11-12 20:01:25 TRUMP TRADES OIL
2714 2018-11-12 20:01:25 Unless they sell off assets and give long term concessions to Russian and Chinese oil companies that have the money and technical know-how to achieve that, but the Venezuelan government share of oil revenue would be small due to risk & cost involved for investors
2715 2018-11-12 20:01:11 We are very sorry to hear that you are disappointed in your interactions with GM, Jeff. Are you currently experiencing this oil consumption concern? We would appreciate the chance to look into you situation further. Please shoot us a DM at your earliest convenience.
2716 2018-11-12 20:01:05 About 20yrs ago I was trying to drive my hooptie from TX to NY. So I ran out of oil and gas, and on to top it off my bank card wouldn’t work. A wonderful gentleman, paid for a full tank of gas and 2 quart of oil and told me to turn around which I did 
2717 2018-11-12 20:01:04 Go for #nuclearpower ?
When we just invested billions and lives to secure oil pipelines build trough nations we destroyed and plummeted into civil war.

ARE YOU F'IN CRAZY?

About that #CO2 #climatechange bullshit your country sells you.
2718 2018-11-12 20:01:04 Nah. What has he actually done? He can’t and hasn’t gotten any legislation of note through other than a tax cut. It’s all scenery. How can he actually influence what a barrel of oil should cost? How specifically?
2719 2018-11-12 20:01:02 Foreign-policy team is making a comeback, even if oil prices rise slightly more than a decade after lehman, investors hunt for
2720 2018-11-12 20:00:58 what if you used cbd oil like that chest rub stuff
2721 2018-11-12 20:00:58 It's 6 trillion now?
I've said often enough 3 trillion was a tall order, no private company or government would pay that & #Hydrogen not only gives big oil a new product to produce, ship, store & sell...but a reason to not fight like hounds to keep gasoline.
2722 2018-11-12 20:00:53 Hopefully Saudi Arabia will not be murdering journalists. And the Oil thing...
2723 2018-11-12 20:00:51 off topic but sis give me some tips on growing eyebrows out is there anything beside castor oil that can grow them??

2726 2018-11-12 20:00:24 market is chasing oil up and down on oil stocks. Sod that its either gas producer or a mix at least. N Gas is just surge consolidate a couple days and surge again and see that carrying on with inventories at record lows and winter arriving.
2727 2018-11-12 20:00:19 Sure but you are forgetting about two important pieces....the $6M Lucic makes and the term that was given to Russell. Again, all good with trading guys just ensure you get fair value and don't make the team worse.
2728 2018-11-12 20:00:14 The perfect stocking filler..... or treat yourELF! 

The Diva team have all road tested this new, use at home, dry oil spray from MoroccanTan and give it a 10/10. We love it and the application is so easy with the mitt  

It will be available in the salon this week!
2729 2018-11-12 20:00:13 Prices are because of your damm restrictions put on Iranian oil.
2730 2018-11-12 19:59:58 Good for the consumer, but bad for people like me who's occupation depends on the production of crude oil. The least amount of crude oil being produced, the least of work I have.
2731 2018-11-12 19:59:58 HH isnt a production well and you will soon see the difference
2732 2018-11-12 19:59:58 When I get this oil change they gonna talk so much shit it’s been so long lmao
2733 2018-11-12 19:59:40 Yes. All the money from Texas oil buying 4/5 tv commercial spots really paid off. Well done!
2734 2018-11-12 19:59:40 Why is @realDonaldTrump tweeting about opec and oil prices when the democrats are STEALING ELECTIONS right in front of us in Florida and Arizona??? Investigate!
2735 2018-11-12 19:59:30 The Keystone XL pipeline is owned by Canada and then exported by America’s shipping ports. We don’t receive oil from the pipeline.
2736 2018-11-12 19:59:26 Just show my sanctuary for cleansing 
Heaven will be sure 
Come with Milli bills Kus ur sins plenty 
I gaz buy monster seed, Jerusalem sand and truck of anointing oil 
2737 2018-11-12 19:59:13 average ...  and the GST on the carbon tax ?  and the larger pipeline the Government is desperate to build ?  selling oil and gas at a multiple to current volumes ...   some fighting there  #cdnpoli
2738 2018-11-12 19:59:08 I love how these idiots never check basic spelling or grammar. The great hateful, hive mind of the die-hard Trump voter is a leaky shack that has no books but certainly a moonshine still, and is located between an oil rig and a firing range.
2739 2018-11-12 19:59:07 PRT paying .115 per month and mostly oil....Permian located, permanent royalties, sponsor owns a bunch of it and has incentive to drill.....has held up in this $12.50 area through the big drop in oil.....that's the one on my watch list...
2740 2018-11-12 19:58:57 I don’t know who needs this but if you reading this, stop putting coconut oil on your face.
2741 2018-11-12 19:58:53 So why is CDA importing oil from mid-east and you alarmists are doing nothing about it?
2742 2018-11-12 19:58:53 Dont try to cheat people . You need the oil price to be up always otherwise there is no profit for you to sell you mexico gulf oil . Your production cost is over 40 dollars per barrel.
come on ... stop that crazy game .
2743 2018-11-12 19:58:45 I need to pick up my purchasing permits, get my oil changed and stop to the abc store...only one is getting done tho
2744 2018-11-12 19:58:44 How long you think until he tweets that he's the reason oil is getting cheaper? lol
2745 2018-11-12 19:58:43 The smell of garlic and chilli peppers frying in olive oil. RT if u agree
2746 2018-11-12 19:58:35 Skin irritation due to the lack of adequate hydration in certain areas causing discouraging and dry skin.Could possibly be resolved with a hot oil treatment or some or other lubricant that will sufficiently moisturize said areas lacking in natural moisture provided by the sculpt
2747 2018-11-12 19:58:20 Why the heck is Chia handling the Oil Kings again?! Ugh
2748 2018-11-12 19:58:17 I love my house but hate that it heats with oil heat...it’s so fucking expensive! Damn!!!! Have to get a job just to get oil...over $100 just for 50 gallons???? OMG!
2749 2018-11-12 19:58:03 Electric cars & solar energy will solve some of the problems with oil prices.
2750 2018-11-12 19:58:02 Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning Midnight Oil Beds Are Burning Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning Midnight Oil Beds Are Burning
2751 2018-11-12 19:58:00 Oil prices have declined over 20% from their highs. How low do you think oil should be? Are you aware that a lot of the new jobs are in the energy sector. Oil prices at $20-30/b means less jobs. Maybe before you tweet at OPEC you should consider the actual impact of lower prices
2752 2018-11-12 19:57:54 Speaking of oil changes, LADIES WITH VEHICLES GET UR OIL CHANGED CUZ ITS PROBABLY AROUND THAT TIME BITCH
2753 2018-11-12 19:57:52 Fracking . Utterly fucking stupid unless your an oil and gas executive waiting for the next pay day   #C4News #renewablesnow
2754 2018-11-12 19:57:29 Greenpeace tmx protest funded by American interests.  This is all about getting highly subsidized products for American companies.  We either need to export raw oil overseas or increase refining and then ship refined fuels.
2755 2018-11-12 19:57:28 How about instead of begging them to not cut oil production, you do something so we are not so dependent on them.
2756 2018-11-12 19:57:27 With US being the top #OIL producer, many shale players may not survive lower prices with tight money supply. Saudis may welcome such a scenario, they cracked the whip too early last time.

2759 2018-11-12 19:57:19 Gotta go all the way to auburn hills for this damn oil change.
2760 2018-11-12 19:57:08 I wish the fuck I would change anybody’s oil.
2761 2018-11-12 19:57:06 LMAO clearly you dont know much about your team, you are owned by an American oil company thats how you became wealthy. Not from winning, damn you are simple.
2762 2018-11-12 19:56:59 Tom Wheeler’s (Director of Regulation at Oil and Gas Authority) outtake from the Thick of It was hilarious. @Channel4News can you post. I need another laugh.
2763 2018-11-12 19:56:59 There is no oil industry w/o the consumer.

But instead of bike paths and mass transportation, we want bigger SUVs, more highways, and more pickup trucks.

we should drill for more oil in FL and use royalties to fund education and healthcare
2764 2018-11-12 19:56:51 Saudi has oil , which is there's to sell at want ever price they see , just like u have your technology to find alternative energy sources , last time I checked an apple iPhone cost more than how many oil barells!
2765 2018-11-12 19:56:49 The point is, we need to get off of ALL oil asap. That means building no more pipelines. We cannot afford to increase production of ANY fossil fuels and that includes Alberta #bitumen. #climatechange
2766 2018-11-12 19:56:48 Since with Palm Oil, the only thing we need to grow, is the Palms. It's still bad, but not as bad. (I don't buy Palm Oil. I also dont buy animal products).

2768 2018-11-12 19:56:33 Ever hear of supply and demand stupid - less oil on the market higher prices. Who wrote the Art of the Deal  for you?
2769 2018-11-12 19:56:30 Call the Prince. Tell him you have a bone to pick with him over oil production. ( just don't slip up and say bone SAW, it might be awkward)
2770 2018-11-12 19:56:29 Got offered to work on the oil fields of Texas with a bunch of Donald trump supporting Americans. HELL TO THE NAWW CUH.
2771 2018-11-12 19:56:24 Oh these people get it. They get the age old tale that there is money in snake oil.
2772 2018-11-12 19:56:17 Oilers' budget has almost no room for Chiarelli to move. Do the math: with Eberle and Hall back on the roster in place of Strome and Larsson shows how little he had to begin with.
2773 2018-11-12 19:56:17 Oil? Salt? Or maybe he’s like the wicked witch of the west?
2774 2018-11-12 19:56:14 I've seen moves this one go way beyond where most thought it could go so I'd be very careful expecting a bounce anytime soon. Now assuming a bounce does occur, yes the 200 EMA/MA coincidences with the bottom of the broken channel.  #oil #OOTT
2775 2018-11-12 19:56:10 We totally agree- for the oil lover in all of us!   
2776 2018-11-12 19:56:05 Tom wheeler oil and gas czar humiliates himself. Is this country now so devoid of smart decent leaders we end up with mediocre individuals such as this. good luck to the 200.000 families within the fracking area . #c4news

2778 2018-11-12 19:55:48 You DO know, don't you, that prices that are too low negatively impact OUR oil producers here in the United States? You do, right? Right?
2779 2018-11-12 19:55:45 The most significant indicator of oil price was US domestic production. Sanctions on Iran serve as price camouflage while US increases domestic production. Today, China and others compete in influence.
2780 2018-11-12 19:55:44 Thinking more and more about going completely vegan... definitely not using any products with palm oil. Even chocolate isn’t worth the guilt!    
2781 2018-11-12 19:55:43 oil totally lost its rally, no bueno
2782 2018-11-12 19:55:42 Herrings me finks. In oil. Me noze me wud love dis. Wud yoo?

2785 2018-11-12 19:55:26 Whilst I applaud the advert can @IcelandFoods icelandfoodsstate how much (un)stainably sourced palm oil they've sourced previously?
2786 2018-11-12 19:55:24 Will check the steak shortly, but the other two are:

Green and yellow pepper sweated with an onion and a little olive oil

Brilliantly, the second most upmarket supermarket in the country sells something VERY close to a hoagie:)
2787 2018-11-12 19:55:20 Three stories from six days ago
- President of Egypt threatened full blown war with Iran if the security of the gulf states was threatened
- Hamas condemned Trump for cutting off Iranian oil exports
- Russian Security Council called the US sanctions on Iran illegal
2788 2018-11-12 19:55:13 Blah, blah blah, yet no one mentions the palm trees.  Ban the stupid palm trees! Palm trees are tiki torches, the fronds are full of oil & the embers burn for miles. Get rid of your palm trees, they look stupid in CA landscape anyways!
2789 2018-11-12 19:55:11 . @realDonaldTrump

Since you fail to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for crimes against our country, in sure they'll reward you with the oil.
2790 2018-11-12 19:55:06 I’ve been sitting at Walmart since 11:30am waiting on this oil change, it’s almost 3pm & have yet to be serviced 
2791 2018-11-12 19:55:05 It's unbelievable that Peter spends more than 1/2 a seconds thought on the Oil Kings.  What a joke that is.
2792 2018-11-12 19:55:00 The Trump admin is filling the swamp w/ oil.
2793 2018-11-12 19:55:00 Let's get it
2794 2018-11-12 19:54:50 getting my oil changed and i feel so NERVOUS like wtf
2795 2018-11-12 19:54:46 U.S. oil prices end below $60 a barrel and mark a record 11 straight session declines
2796 2018-11-12 19:54:37 OPEC and non-OPEC(Russia) agreed to oil production cuts before Trump was sworn in. Compliance has bounced around a lot. I'm curious why NOW talk about this? Side note for some juicy drama Rosneft/Russia is working with the Kurds to make a Mid East gas line.
2797 2018-11-12 19:54:34 Thank you Valvoline for the 50% off my oil change.
2798 2018-11-12 19:54:23 They voted NOT to impose a 2500 foot setback on dripping ops, and the oil and gas lobby spent MILLIONS to oppose it. Had they enacted it, the OG group claimed a lot of lost jobs, taxes and of course threatened to move out of state (we have some global and North American HQ here).
2799 2018-11-12 19:54:21 US #crude falls for an 11th straight day, posting its longest losing streak on record.  #oil
2800 2018-11-12 19:54:14 “Oil prices should be much lower based on supply”
LOL says who?
We are so beyond the laws of supply and demand dictating oil prices! Hilarious
2801 2018-11-12 19:54:12 No one will believe me when i say i actually took my own car for an oil change today lol
2802 2018-11-12 19:54:11 But he's big ;) ...
2803 2018-11-12 19:54:09 Love this stunning view, reminds me of a Richard Rowan where he paints oil on glass
2804 2018-11-12 19:54:06 California wildfires show costs of #climatechange are immediate, vast and life-threatening - yet strangely unmentionable by excuse-making US president in the pockets of coal and oil barons #C4News
2805 2018-11-12 19:54:04 WTF are we going to sell to Norway? Gas, oil, fish or corrupt and singularly stupid MPs? We've got lots of the latter.
2806 2018-11-12 19:54:01 Amazing, we somehow had unlimited resources to build pipelines, refineries, and stabilize oil producing regions with our military to make fossil cars work, but homemade electricity? That's somehow too expensive?
2807 2018-11-12 19:54:01 We need a government that is willing to get our oil to market. This will benefit all Canadians
2808 2018-11-12 19:53:58 Hey Dum Dum. Low oil prices means low demand, very likely caused by slowing commodity usage i.e. slowing economies around the globe.  Sheesh.
2809 2018-11-12 19:53:57 Oil and coal are the only Black Lives that matter to Trump!
2810 2018-11-12 19:53:56 @gillhp check c4news site for story on disaster that is fracking in holland...and defence of uk fracking on the basis that uk geology is different...by oil/gas regulator fella who knows less about geology than wot i does #frackinghell
2811 2018-11-12 19:53:43 Unfortunately the RSPO allows deforestation. How sustainable is it? Tomorrow they vote on whether to move to zero deforestation.If the body promoting sustainable Palm Oil, has to consider ' a no deforestation policy', one should question how sustainable it is.
2812 2018-11-12 19:53:42 every single patriot in USA should tweet only about the corruption in midterm election by dems #stopthecorruptdemcollusion
2813 2018-11-12 19:53:40 my mechanic yelling at me because i got sludge in my engine. i aint know he meant change the oil every 3k miles frfr

2815 2018-11-12 19:53:20 Hi Victoria, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Best wishes, Matt.
2816 2018-11-12 19:53:16 Chiarelli on Russell - Nurse pairing: Going into the last road trip, the pair had been solid...let that set in people. This is the man evaluating where this team is. @OilersNow
2817 2018-11-12 19:53:12 What OPEC Giveth, Trump Taketh Away:

WTI has been down every day for the last 11 trading-days, the longest period on record (the Nymex WTI oil contract started trading March 30, 1983). | #OOTT #OPEC #SaudiArabia
2818 2018-11-12 19:53:11 Rocky session for oil prices. Nymex was up as much as 1.8% overnight on hopes OPEC members open to cutting supply. President Trump tweet encouraging no cut to oil supply wiped out all gains. Oil price now down 0.8% in after hours trade #ausbiz
2819 2018-11-12 19:53:09 In other words, Vlad & I had a discussion about oil prices not more than two days ago. He told me I wasn’t doing enough to get oil prices near $80 a barrel, a price he needs to amass more wealth without worrying about pesky things like the Magnitsky Act. I’ll try harder Vlad.
2820 2018-11-12 19:53:08 You are saying that but you mean opposite. High oil price is more profit to US.
2821 2018-11-12 19:53:04 Always gotta rip it after a fresh oil change
2822 2018-11-12 19:53:02 Or we sag oil bye bye
2823 2018-11-12 19:53:02 FAKE-media:  'oil posts its longest losing streak ever'

REAL-news:  The recent precipitous drop in the price of oil a WIN for American consumers.
2824 2018-11-12 19:53:01 So you are not OK with them cutting the oil supply, however you give them cover for cutting up a journalist?
2825 2018-11-12 19:52:54 I was reading something before about the impact it has on indigenous tribes of the Amazon, turns out they too have been getting killed so loggers & oil men can get what they want. The new Brazilian president can't wait to allow more. Heartbreaking 
2826 2018-11-12 19:52:53 I could sell you cheap Chinese trinkets, or I could sell you hope and healing in liquid format, and that's why I chose to deal in CBD Oil. The organic CBD Oil you'll pay for, but the love you'll also get is FREE.
2827 2018-11-12 19:52:52 Agreeing and then ignoring it is a great way to lead people off a cliff.  I’ve seen more than a few “new & nascent” behaviors which amounted to nothing. Don’t peddle snake oil.
2828 2018-11-12 19:52:52 And if Trump won’t take our steel and aluminum without exorbitant tariffs, because of some lame security threat, how can he take our oil at a discount? Why would Canada do this?
2829 2018-11-12 19:52:48 People talk millions and I be talking about opening up oil at the nothpoll zillions
2830 2018-11-12 19:52:45 His inaction on the Saudi regime for murdering dissenters is his way of encouraging SA to keep oil prices low.
2831 2018-11-12 19:52:41 Your approach displaces the most environmentally strong oil producer in the world with much weaker ones ... kind of stupid isn’t it.
2832 2018-11-12 19:52:26 Oil prices should be much higher based on demand!
thanks Mr. president for reminding me of ECO 101
2833 2018-11-12 19:52:26 Don’t be fooled by slick oil salesmen... they are all the same. Just like Boris he is hedging his bets knowing that a second vote is likely coming
2834 2018-11-12 19:52:19 Who gives a shit about Saudi Arabia...they can keep their oil...welcome to the age of clean energy Donald. Also...dont ally America with villiany. What is it with you and North Korea and Putin? Geez!
2835 2018-11-12 19:52:15 No heat and oil treatments and try to stay away from any product the has ammonia in it 
2836 2018-11-12 19:52:12 What are your thoughts on oil? Setting up for a bounce to the 200ma? Thann you for your analysis!
2837 2018-11-12 19:52:06 Boiling in oil.
2838 2018-11-12 19:52:02 Saw him win the Hoosier Hundred in and at Lucas Oil where he had an INCREDIBLE battle with his brother in May. Is he on McLaren's radar? Probably not. Does he deserve a shot at the 500 if he wants one? Absolutely.
2839 2018-11-12 19:51:58 This oil and gas regulator dude, Tom Wheeler, is floundering badly on @Channel4News - clearly hasn’t a clue and in the pockets of the oil/gas bosses - quelle surprise #stopfracking #climateemergency
2840 2018-11-12 19:51:53 Saw some missiles go off in Gaza ... should be good for oil. As far as the market, wouldn't mind another 15% overall drop to flush things out
2841 2018-11-12 19:51:53 So true!

I suppose the assumption I am challenging is that oil pullers (and other alt medders) are stupid and unhealthy because of their poor choices. I submit most aren’t.
2842 2018-11-12 19:51:41 Kweli madereva wamekuwa kama Malaya, shot ni 25shs for 4passengers ili upewe 100 na lubrication oil ya kudrive ni 115shs per litre meaning, when u think your the one screwing them ur being screwed hard instead
2843 2018-11-12 19:51:40 i don’t entirely disagree w/ this, aside from the major world wars, i don’t really think most of the engagements done by the US (over oil) were necessary for american protection. same with the wars over “the red threat”. it was more so political/economic motivation
2844 2018-11-12 19:51:40 Why should we remain dependent upon Saudi oil when we can use our own oil from Texas? The Saudis are committing genocide in Yemen with weapons we supplied to them. It's a really bad deal all around, Mr. President.
2845 2018-11-12 19:51:35 Your sanctions on Iran are what are increasing oil prices! YOU are the cause of every problem in this world!

#ResignNow
2846 2018-11-12 19:51:34 don't know if what I have counts as beard....is there such a thing as patch oil? lol
2847 2018-11-12 19:51:22 BTW your calls on Oil and so many other things have been simply a incredible - well done hks
2848 2018-11-12 19:51:14 How many new schools, hospitals would $100 Billion a day allow.  And no oil & gas industry has been around longer .. the 1940’s... and it has funded the vast expansion of CDA’s social programs.
2849 2018-11-12 19:51:10 You are more worried about them cutting oil production than you are about them cutting up journalists.  You have no soul.
2850 2018-11-12 19:51:04 Cut peppers, cauliflower, carrots, etc.  Drizzled in oil, throw some spices at them, oven until the edges blacken, done.
2851 2018-11-12 19:51:01 Yeah hence they crushed a GDP OF 10 TO 6 with demonetization.we were 3 largest economy and now we are 6th. Crude oil was 150 a barrel for 64 per litre now 55 or so for 85 per litre. Rupee at 75 or so. Because MODI IS A FUCKEER! Thanks bhakt 
2852 2018-11-12 19:50:57 #oilandgas With oil settling lower at the official time, that is an 11th straight down-day, what Dow Jones points out as the longest streak it can find going all the way back to 1983. Apparently Trump trumps OPEC and Saudi Arabia.
2853 2018-11-12 19:50:53 this n jax talking about going to church as a kid and the priest throwing oil at his face
2854 2018-11-12 19:50:48 This is good to know! I’m always worried of which is real essential oil or not as well, and if I should buy from Doterra, now I know!
2855 2018-11-12 19:50:45 Ohhh yeah that's fixed and fine but she's leaking oil now
2856 2018-11-12 19:50:44 You know what I'm asking for for Christmas? Money for a tire rotation and oil change. It is truly what would make me happiest.
2857 2018-11-12 19:50:38 Growing up, we were given a fish oil pill every day in school, and I loved them.
2858 2018-11-12 19:50:36 They should stop selling you oil
2859 2018-11-12 19:50:25 Don’t they sale travel size baby oil or I gotta put my own in a container  why the hell I haven’t found none yet tho
2860 2018-11-12 19:50:19 Oh no. How dare you support your son by opposing misinformation. 

Annie, get over here and stop helping big oil. We’re on a mission, and we don’t like Trump either.
2861 2018-11-12 19:50:10 Tom Wheeler, “Director of Regulation”, at the Oil & Gas Authority, on @c4news defending Govt policy on fracking.
Blustering away, he wasn’t even aware of the statements on his own organisation’s website.
Guess what, he’s another fucking useless posh boy Oxford PPE graduate.
2862 2018-11-12 19:50:07 Our oil prices are up and unemployment is down. We are benefiting from recovery.
2863 2018-11-12 19:49:58 Oil prices when Obama was president was lower and has been rising during the 2 Reublican presidents before and after him.  Go figure
2864 2018-11-12 19:49:58 Hey, @realDonaldTrump . 'The United States, with less than 5% of the global population, uses about a quarter of the world's fossil fuel resources—burning up nearly 25% of the coal, 26% of the oil, and 27% of the world's natural gas.'  So I think you can pay a bit more into @NATO
2865 2018-11-12 19:49:57 @IcelandFoods how many of your products contain palm oil? #NoPalmOilChristmas
2866 2018-11-12 19:49:56 I think every OPEC rat is pumping all out. I am a horrible oil trader, but I saw the October 2008 swan dive first hand. Stuff gets weird fast.
2867 2018-11-12 19:49:47 Just seen Director of Oil & Gas Regulator on @Channel4News I am not filled with confidence to put it mildly. @cathynewman #Fracking

2869 2018-11-12 19:49:39 That's a lot of oil.
2870 2018-11-12 19:49:32 That information was wrong when alarmists printed it and in no way represents the vast improvements made in extracting the oil from the CDN oil sands over the last decade.  California oil is much dirtier, boycott it. Mideast still flares excess gas, in AB it is used.
2871 2018-11-12 19:49:29 Thank you for special memories. #RIPStanLee
2872 2018-11-12 19:49:26 The electoral college is rigged? Russia influenced the election? You need to ease off the meds.
2873 2018-11-12 19:49:21 What is wrong with acting as if it were true and saving lives and nature anyway? What is prepping but the preparation for disaster? Letting a potential disaster happen because it's inconvenient for rich oil owners to change is the epitome of laziness.
2874 2018-11-12 19:49:14 i can't handle more poop right now. there's so much of it...

2876 2018-11-12 19:49:07 #RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
2877 2018-11-12 19:48:58 Oh wow, poor guy from the oil and gas authority having an absolute mare on @Channel4News 

Thank god there is a moratorium I'm Scotland. The UK should learn the lessons from the Netherlands before greedy companies destroy parts of the country in the UK. #banfracking
2878 2018-11-12 19:48:56 It a sad day when an ad can't be shown that criticises the palm oil industry in favor of wild life and nature. Sad state of affairs!
2879 2018-11-12 19:48:51 So a man is gonna "pick her" just cuz she changed oil??  y'all needa let her live and get the hate outcha heart mane
2880 2018-11-12 19:48:47 We get most oil from South America. I assume the amount we get from SA is still coming in. The crazy part is we are exporting oil. Why isn’t kept here? Because it is sold on the open market and we bid for it with the rest of the world even though taxes subsidized oil companies.
2881 2018-11-12 19:48:42 I live in Lancashire watching the report in to gas extraction in the Netherlands. Tim Wheeler (from the Oil and Gas Authority) on C4 News tonight didn't give me any confidence in Quadrilla's fracking.  As far as I'm concerned they can fuck off back to America.
2882 2018-11-12 19:48:36 Their poop is the easiest poop.
2883 2018-11-12 19:48:26 My company North Range Resources is pumping American crude everyday in North Dakota. Selfishly I’d like higher oil prices but affordable energy is security!
2884 2018-11-12 19:48:22 Is this a joke interview with oil gas regulator  @channel4news
2885 2018-11-12 19:48:19 High oil prices wouldn’t be good for your approval rating
2886 2018-11-12 19:48:18 Why am I not feeling a great deal of confidence after listening to that man from the Oil and Gas Authority.? #C4News #fracking
2887 2018-11-12 19:48:18 Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world. Surely you could make a deal with them. Oh.. I forgot... you called their leader a liar and imposed arbitrary tariffs on their steel and aluminum and told them that they would pay for insulting you. The Art of the Deal, my A
2888 2018-11-12 19:48:14 Remarkable @Channel4News report on fracking in Holland. Homes destroyed, incalculable misery for people. Then a terrible performance from the Oil & Gas industry regulator.

But apart from the risks to surface dwellers HOW ABOUT KEEPING CARBON IN THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE 
2889 2018-11-12 19:48:10 Olive oil, little bit of lemon juice, and some Dijon mustard 
2890 2018-11-12 19:48:07 Very unconvincing performance by the director of the Oil and Gas authority on Channel 4 News re fracking just now.
2891 2018-11-12 19:48:05 The US wants two things:oil price to rise,via cut supply or production ..& they want the European Union to struggle,even fall.Hence the U.K/US 'Special relationship' strengthening,not only for trade,I add but the US scavenging into the UK for business
2892 2018-11-12 19:47:53 i miss having dogs...but i don't think i can handle all the extra poop.
2893 2018-11-12 19:47:45 It’s that season to switch your body lotion for Shea butter/coconut oil so you don’t go about looking like a white walker.
2894 2018-11-12 19:47:44 #c4news The Director Of Regulations for the Oil And Gas Industry doesn’t know about Geology and doesn’t know about statements on his own website. 

#Fracking
2895 2018-11-12 19:47:42 The oil on this planet belongs there. Oil is the blood of the earth. The Earth is our Beloved Mother. We have her DNA. Selling Mother Earth's blood, is Not exceptable. Bring out the suppressed tech, and lets leave Mother Earth's blood in the ground. She too needs to Live. <3
2896 2018-11-12 19:47:40 I'd not seen the original Greenpeace video and was only vaguely aware of the issues around palm oil. This blog makes it all so much clearer and has raised my awareness of "dirty palm oil." thank you, well done & keep up the brilliant work
2897 2018-11-12 19:47:40 Happy pampering! Is that Revelations luxury bath oil we spy? 
2898 2018-11-12 19:47:36 In the video he compares people eating bacon (pigs: domestic, not endangered) with using palm oil (orangutans: wild, very much endangered). This is a logical fallacy.

And I hate prejudice too, but in this case I think it's safe to say the guy is white...

2900 2018-11-12 19:47:27 Neither does the US (need Saudi oil).
2901 2018-11-12 19:47:25 Maybe 1950's style to shovel coal & barrels of oil off the ships to mil transport then up the M20 to London …. ohh M20 blocked, its a lorry park?

2902 2018-11-12 19:47:24 Tacos? Breakfast tacos? Avocado on toast? Sliced tomatoes and feta with olive oil? Cheese toast? Cold chicken salad on rye?! WHAT DO I WANT FOR BREAKFAST
2903 2018-11-12 19:47:14 Saudi Arabia should be able to sell oil at whatever price they see fit. It's their oil. No idea why they allow the OPEC gang to boss them around. Very bad business.
2904 2018-11-12 19:47:13 You really have to get your oil changed more than like once a year huh
2905 2018-11-12 19:47:08 Well if they do we can increase US oil Production
2906 2018-11-12 19:47:03 I guy who isn’t an expert is on  #C4News trying to explain from the OIL & GAS AUTHORITY why a 4 might not be a 4 & why Holland “is different”. Its not instilling much confidence tbh
2907 2018-11-12 19:47:00 Hopefully, Saudis will not be cutting the necks of more journalists criticizing them. But Trump cares about oil & weapons deals, not dismembered reporters ("the enemy of the people"). Actually, he does care: "bad original concept, carried out poorly, cover-up worst in the history

2910 2018-11-12 19:46:49 He’s tweeting about oil prices today.
2911 2018-11-12 19:46:49 I thought you bragged that we are oil independent .
2912 2018-11-12 19:46:43 to having cheaper oil & please Israel governments all country's  did work together to destroy those country's

You're fracking kidding me, right?

#c4news
2915 2018-11-12 19:46:37 #c4news the head of the Oil and Gas Authority isn't a geologist, doesn't know what is on his department's website and is nothing more than a human shield for Cuadrilla.
2916 2018-11-12 19:46:34 See, what you are experiencing now, is that since we're not moving at the  pace we were toward NOT being dependent on fossil fuel, there's now a HIGHER DEMAND for oil... putting us at the mercy of the middle east, hence they can charge whatever they want!! So, this is ALL YOU!!
2917 2018-11-12 19:46:29 Michelle has no advice to give on the best body oil for nude photos. Sorry.

2919 2018-11-12 19:46:22 @RealistNews Joe my wife will be contacting you in regards to hemp works and CBD oil. Thank you Joe. Gratitude.
2920 2018-11-12 19:46:20 Why does it matter...? The US gets the manority of their oil from Canada !
2921 2018-11-12 19:46:17 Lmao dude I've been short oil over the weekend and still am short, this is crazy haha! Hopefully I survive!
2922 2018-11-12 19:46:17 On the one hand, we should hope that they will not be cutting oil production so that oil prices could be lower, on the other hand we should try and substitute alternative sustainable energy sources for oil in the long run, because oil pollutes.

We Canadians know how well you support the Alberta Oil Industry with a big house ,Jet Plane trips,cars!
2928 2018-11-12 19:45:55 As has been said before and for decades this Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars of the oil revenue on terrorist activities and not on development of his people. It's time for the people of Iran to ask
2929 2018-11-12 19:45:52 Solar cannot replace the energy density of oil, LNG or nuclear (being the most energy dense). Realistically, we have to “pick our poison”. Responsible, long term management of nuclear waste is possible. It’s also the best option of pollution per watt energy source we have now.
2930 2018-11-12 19:45:48 It's still happening today. You think they'd be bombing the Middle East killing millions if they didn't have oil? I just showed you what he Wall Street dictatorship is doing to my Homeland of Puerto Rico. The We$t are the is and continue to be so via imperialism, theft and force.
2931 2018-11-12 19:45:47 #channel4news giving the fracking industry a hard time, right to do so. The evidence of danger is there.

Why do we need to take any geological risks with fracking, when we could invest in totally safe renewable energy?

A clear demonstration of the lobbying power of 'big oil'.
2932 2018-11-12 19:45:45 Because people who practice these fringe therapies are typically well educated and health conscious.  If their teeth and gums deteriorated while oil pulling, they wouldn’t boast about it and would move on to something else.

That’s just my own weird hypothesis. I could be wrong.
2933 2018-11-12 19:45:45 Should you have to pay your father for changing your breaks and oil?
2934 2018-11-12 19:45:43 Turkish President Erdogan, revealed that the audio recordings of Khasoggi Murder was shared with US, Germany, Canada, UK and other relevant intelligence services.

2942 2018-11-12 19:45:15 I use natural PB, but if there's no oil added, it usually doesn't separate much in my experience. Made my own for many years, but in SF there's much better options.
2943 2018-11-12 19:45:07 INCORRECT.

- Fed land is not all "forest"
- Fed land incl Indian Res, Mil., EPA Protected (incl Public Water,  Endangered Species), 26 NatL Parks, Oil & Gas, Leased land (NOT  Residential)

2962 2018-11-12 19:43:55 The United States’ goal for the past 30 years has been energy independence. Industry was caught off guard when it finally happened in 2014. Now Canadian oil and gas has lost its biggest customer and is scrambling to find a new one. That’s not government’s fault.
2963 2018-11-12 19:43:29 Hey Susan, we completely understand your concern with this. 98% of our palm oil use is already sustainable, and we're currently working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted ASAP... 1/2
2964 2018-11-12 19:43:27 Wow.. my luck is terrible. I come to get my oil changed and they lose my key..
2965 2018-11-12 19:43:24 Grey Sky scenario for Oil is $0
2966 2018-11-12 19:43:23 Now Trump is an oil expert. and the balance of supply and demand. If he thinks he's going to control OPEC he's nuts
2967 2018-11-12 19:43:21 @PETAUK hi- please can u help? In the midst of the palm oil debate with my son and we’d like to know whether approved peta products contain sustainable palm oil or are the palm oil ingredients overlooked seen as they don’t contain animal products?
2968 2018-11-12 19:43:21 He doesn‘t run it by himself. He can talk a lot more than he can do. What can he actually do to effect what a barrel of oil should cost, other than talk about it?

2977 2018-11-12 19:43:02 I did not know that. Will check products more carefully. I was under the impression palm oil isn't good for you as well.
2978 2018-11-12 19:42:58 Nov 2016

#WCS Oil - $30/bl

2979 2018-11-12 19:42:53 Me: looks up 3x long oil ETF and buy OTM calls
2980 2018-11-12 19:42:41 #SaudiArabia will reduce #oil supply next month by 500,000 barrels per day in response to lower demand, and more cuts could follow next year. #energy
2981 2018-11-12 19:42:40 It's vegetable Oil ohhh my brother.....Bonny light Vegetable Oil, Oloiribi Vegetable Oil.
2982 2018-11-12 19:42:40 He was just another corporate Democrat. I don't get it either, @nikoCSFB . He had a huge fundraiser by big oil just a few days before the election. Don't we deserve better than that? @_SemaHernandez_  was the real candidate for the people.
2983 2018-11-12 19:42:35 Iraq Educational Sector can advance through a long-term scholarship program where Iraqi students (future teaching faculty) can pursue higher education in  US universities. such a program has been launched in 2009 but suspended in 2013 due to oil price plummet crisis.
2984 2018-11-12 19:42:25 Iran produces more oil than Sadi Arabia, and of course you cut that supply off to everyone but your boyfriend Vladimir
2985 2018-11-12 19:42:18 Pretty much every week:
Recruiter: Hey Billy, i've got a position at a great oil & gas company
Me: yea, im guessing they want someone onsite
Recruiter: yea, unfortunately they want someone onsite

I see oil and gas is going to get left behind in talent acquisition and renewables.
2986 2018-11-12 19:42:11 So disappointed to read label, after eating, @waitrose cheap mince pies contain #palm oil as well as #corn syrup - #cheapfood. Answer is, make our own and only eat on special occasions !
2987 2018-11-12 19:42:09 Groundnut oil anointing, my brother.
2988 2018-11-12 19:42:05 I buy only sunflower oil
2989 2018-11-12 19:42:05 At current pace, oil will never go up again.
2990 2018-11-12 19:41:53 Oil cleanser! Avoid any foaming cleansers!
2991 2018-11-12 19:41:53 Hopefully he's losing his impact on oil. He misled #OPEC over Iran sanctions and they ain't too happy.
2992 2018-11-12 19:41:52 If the Saudis/OPEC cut oil production, the higher prices would create hardships for many Texans & industries!
2993 2018-11-12 19:41:50 Trump thinks oil should be much lower....
2994 2018-11-12 19:41:49 @OilersNow No question the Oilers have had a decent start to their year but for Pete to come out and say there "has been lots of good things" is comical. Yes, Chiasson & Caggiula got on heaters but what has happened that is a good sign for the club long-term?
2995 2018-11-12 19:41:37 My scheduling mistake means #FDSC105 can either be about margarine (fights for legitimacy w/ butter, PUFA health claims, trans fats, palm oil) OR visions for development (@CharlesCMann-ish wizard vs. prophet stuff, Norman Borlaug vs Vandana Siva, Butz vs Berry). What do you say?
2996 2018-11-12 19:41:18 You and your LOVE of oil is a Threat not just to the planet but to National Security!!!!
2997 2018-11-12 19:41:17 The President seems to forget we produce oil here too, not just import oil.
2998 2018-11-12 19:41:14 E serie K espira 19. Estou em PETRA319 porque rolei as de dezembro, acho que já ficou muito em cima. Oil não para de cair.
2999 2018-11-12 19:41:13 only @hasanminhaj can have me sit and enjoying learning about oil for 25 minutes
3000 2018-11-12 19:41:02 Why should we sell our oil at cheaper price. Would you accept this for the USA Mr. President. You are refusing a trade deficit between the US and any other country yet you want us to sacrifice and sell our products cheap.
3001 2018-11-12 19:41:00 Now tell me, Trump, isn't Russia making a "bundle" of money with higher oil prices. We don't like how gas prices have gone up since U R President. In fact, I don't like much of anything U have done. Would be nice if you just RESIGN! We don't want you or your family in Gov't! 
3002 2018-11-12 19:40:59 good job sacrificing our democratic values for oil we don't even need. Stand up for human rights. They cut up kassoghi and burned him in acid. I see why you don't care cause the media is the #1 enemy of the people. Do you have any humanity at all?
3003 2018-11-12 19:40:57 If you overfill your best bet is to drain and refill with the second jug we stuck in the back of the shop. There is no way to recycle drained oil back into the engine right now.
3004 2018-11-12 19:40:53 $GE's fall is a good dry run for what we probably see in next recession. Leveraged company built on older technology finds itself in trouble when sales dry up (in its case - power gen, lighting).  Next up, oil extraction, automobile makers.
3005 2018-11-12 19:40:38 You really got them over the barrel. Dependant on their oil and military contracts, really holding their feet to the fire.
3006 2018-11-12 19:40:33 @meinekecarcare Meineke #156 in Dover NJ turned me an Army Vet away during your Veteran's Day free oil change promotion. They actually told me "Meineke didn't send us any oil this year." HOW?!?! You owe me an oil change!!!!!
3007 2018-11-12 19:40:30 Making a real conscious effort to not buy products containing palm oil, BUT IT’S IN BLOODY EVERYTHING
3008 2018-11-12 19:40:30 I've got a question answered from anyone ??? What's Ambercrombie's oil  new contact info and address?? Also when did they relocate?
3009 2018-11-12 19:40:27 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
3010 2018-11-12 19:40:16 What does this have to do with oil production ?
3011 2018-11-12 19:40:15 Why don't you let the oil markets control themselves ?  All we need is you getting your fingers in those markets.  We would all be paying $5 bucks a gallon for gas like we did under Bush2 in no time!
3012 2018-11-12 19:40:08 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
3013 2018-11-12 19:39:59 What does Gartman have to say about oil stocks?  
3014 2018-11-12 19:39:58 So today me and my mom finessed a $80 oil change down to $50 at take 5 
3015 2018-11-12 19:39:54 Yes, especially since you gave oil companies a huge tax cut and they still screw consumers.
Intersesting, when crude oil prices go down, it takes a few days for gas prices to decrease. But when they go up, gas prices go up immediately?
3016 2018-11-12 19:39:40 Put oil on your body while youre still wet after showering, then lather some body cream, I use this soap with loofah in it to exfoliate, after shaving use a shaving balm, for underarms it best to epilate than to shave..
3017 2018-11-12 19:39:28 The OIl market knows there is a recession coming, our National debt doubled by the GOP will destroy us.
3018 2018-11-12 19:39:26 my family's dogs actually never really drank from the toilet. they did other stuff, but not that.
3019 2018-11-12 19:39:15 you are pushing prices up by your  boycott of Iranian oil
3020 2018-11-12 19:39:00 So since you always say the opposite gas and oil prices will be going up! Isn't that great! $2.88 for gas here, highest it's been in quite awhile, heating oil close to $3.00 I live where it gets below 0 in the winter! 

MAGA=MORONS ARE GOVERNING AMERICA
3021 2018-11-12 19:38:57 Canine Rules
#1: Never barf on the tile.
#2: Never depart the toilet without a mouth FULL of water.

@curreymich @Oil_Guns_Merica
3022 2018-11-12 19:38:50 $AMRN Do you think Herper and Feurstein ever have agendas?  I will believe that they are "amazing" reporters when they update their articles to reflect what we, and they, now know about the mineral oil issue.
3023 2018-11-12 19:38:39 Before we go that way, Mr Libertad, can we ensure that there is no fraud in Florida? I mean, since the two discussed business with the Trumps, it is enough to allow electoral fraud? What constitutes the mind of a liberal? Grass?
3024 2018-11-12 19:38:34 But the much vaunted economic boom between 2003-2007 was superficially built on the quicksilver fundamentals largely underpinned by volatile oil prices. Very minimal diversification was accomplished that contributed to the long running legacy
3025 2018-11-12 19:38:18 They sure like spending the revenue generated from  Canadian oil..and unless the plan is to deficit spend forever the various levels of government better learn to like them and get off their asses and get some pipelines built.  It's time to stop listening to USA funded interests!
3026 2018-11-12 19:38:10 I use a 750mg oil and I do like half a dropper. It helps a lot with my endometriosis pain and with my anxiety
3027 2018-11-12 19:38:10 Take step, whatever. You won’t be having oil from us lol. Keep talking about your pipelines shorty 
3028 2018-11-12 19:38:05 I mean they had a point! That chick made Olive Oil look like later years Anna Nicole Smith!
3029 2018-11-12 19:37:59 Do you think the % of NU fans at Lucas Oil will be higher than there was at home vs Michigan (if they play Michigan again)
3030 2018-11-12 19:37:46 Oil traders now understanding how bean traders have felt since April
3031 2018-11-12 19:37:32 20 time- champions please atleast let us have that as you have the oil money and unfair ffp
3032 2018-11-12 19:37:30 Does "Super Genius Businessman" Trump not understand the Commodity (OIL/GAS/Mining)& it's relationship to the Business' & the workers employed? It's expensive to drill and hire, if Oil crashes there's NO LONGER a need for the Workers.Not to mention stock prices! @realDonaldTrump
3033 2018-11-12 19:37:28 Desperation might be the Mother of Invention - at least as far as Canada's oil industry is concerned. With limited pipeline capacity, bloating & dangerous rail shipments, Canada needs a new, safe alternative.
Enter Canapux - oil in a solid, safe, buoyant puck form. Read on.
3034 2018-11-12 19:37:22 WOW! What is happening in the oil market? It has just experienced its longest losing streak on record! 11 days straight! #economics
3035 2018-11-12 19:37:11 Venezuela is actually under attack from America for it's refusal to give 100% of oil profits to the companies instead they keep 30% to fund education and healthcare. We are paying for training and supplying weapons to anyone who wants to take over the government
3036 2018-11-12 19:37:10 I haven’t witnessed or seen any reports, and it seems counterintuitive, but I posit that most oil pullers have very healthy teeth and gums.
3037 2018-11-12 19:37:00 @realDonaldTrump Hopefully, saudi arabia and opec will be cutting oil production not. Be much lower based on supply, oil prices should!
3038 2018-11-12 19:36:54 Will it’s the future I understand that and it was with tongue in cheek when I started winding the Tesla fans up. But I am old school standing in cold winter forest’s in wales watching mk2 escorts and Chevette Hsr’s going sideways and that smell of petrol and hot oil
3039 2018-11-12 19:36:53 Doesn't all that oil go to other countries anyway?
3040 2018-11-12 19:36:48 Well the oil need a winter lmao
3041 2018-11-12 19:36:46 Our movement need to create commercials like the one Iceland media & palm oil corporations are attempting to censor along with radio ads, billboards targeting gov'ts if they're the leading culprit. China needs a wake-up call. Find Chinese owned entities in US, UK, Europe, etc.
3042 2018-11-12 19:36:34 My dad is changing the oil in my car today and he called me asking about my headlight because he’s gonna fix that too! #blessed #spoiled
3043 2018-11-12 19:36:33 Oil is a commodity set by the market. Investors and speculators affect the price not your tweets. If supply is high and the costs are high, then blame the investors. Are you sure you're smart? You keep saying that but a lack of basic understanding of commodities says otherwise.
3044 2018-11-12 19:36:31 Maybe it will be raining oil??  
3045 2018-11-12 19:36:28 Don’t think so, Jack!  Try the rising value of the dollar to other currencies, and the drop in crude oil prices. Maybe take a real MBA course, instead of sleeping though it.
3046 2018-11-12 19:36:26 OPEC can do whatever they choose with their oil. Now go throw your tantrum
3047 2018-11-12 19:36:19 Deforestation is the issue. Palm oil isn't. Pound for pound, when sustainably grown & farm, it is better than many other oils. So all this talk of banning palm oil is not helpful. Also, Iceland planned this and more people have seen it than ever would have if it had been approved
3048 2018-11-12 19:36:17 That's the wrong kind. The best kind is vinegar and oil based.
3049 2018-11-12 19:36:14 If fracking operations are successful we will all benefit from cheaper energy,just like we did when we discovered North Sea gas and oil. #c4news
3050 2018-11-12 19:36:08 Let me ask you a question Donald Trump do you actually know what your doing don’t tell me what you’ve done tell me what you actually understand what’s going on with the orders you enact . The forest fire federal funds and many other things I like you to answer  oil prices, etc
3051 2018-11-12 19:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3052 2018-11-12 19:35:58 Anyone wondering.

3053 2018-11-12 19:35:57 I've never found a good replacement :( someone suggested mature "cheddar" with coconut oil? It tastes good, but not like cheese...
3054 2018-11-12 19:35:57 Poor little baby didn't have his way. Now you'll just Babble tweet about other oil places.
3055 2018-11-12 19:35:51 Perhaps not just "pasta and pizza"; the Mediterranian (Italian) diet has been proven to be healthier, eg. olive oil, tomato, red wine. The Okinawan (Japanese) diet has also been proven to be quite healthy, eg more of fish, soy, vegetables.
3056 2018-11-12 19:35:49 Went to my hometown, had lunch with my momma, got my oil changed, new wind shield wipers, inspection done, and clean sheets on my bed. Day off well spent

3061 2018-11-12 19:35:30 Your hair spray with aloe vera is the one @PurpulHair. 

The lady who’s been doing my hair for years couldn’t believe how clean my scalp has suddenly become. And I’ve been using your spray and the hair oil. But I started using the spray about two months ago. So 
3062 2018-11-12 19:35:22 I get pre workout from there all the time n I gotta say it’s the best. I just ordered fish oil from there!!
3063 2018-11-12 19:35:10 VSレヴューの戦い方はなんとなく理解した
3064 2018-11-12 19:35:08 If we're now the biggest producers of oil, keep it home and drop our own prices.
3065 2018-11-12 19:35:07 He didn’t give them anything. The sanctions remain. He didn’t give them food, oil, money or nuclear reactors, unlike his Democrat predecessors.
3066 2018-11-12 19:35:06 This something to do with that hairstyle? I read that pomade is 'scented ointment or oil for dressing the hair' - is that where this stems from? Just curious 
3067 2018-11-12 19:35:00 Closed my #uso short from last week and looking to get long! #oil #trading #oversold #signals #wti
3068 2018-11-12 19:34:57 Now that we know the DNC is fully behind the Russia BS; we should lift sanctions and let them contribute to the oil supply. Boom... globalists will cry.
3069 2018-11-12 19:34:55 Lovely people lovely country, lots of oil and lots of money. Sounds like a perfect trading partner
3070 2018-11-12 19:34:39 Oil prices are inelastic to price , meaning the demand curve is basically horizontal
3071 2018-11-12 19:34:35 Trump doesn't know that the U.S. produces lot's of oil and will loose as a result of lower prices.
3072 2018-11-12 19:34:27 Domestic manufacturing oil and gas production, cutting a lot of Obamas stupid regulations that enable our companies to compete with foreign companies... basically putting America First and not worrying about other countries...
3073 2018-11-12 19:34:18 Not a make up guru but I have oily skin and NYX Angel Veil worked well for oil reduction
3074 2018-11-12 19:34:16 not to sound like a zealous rabbit but dressing salads w/ just olive oil and/or lemon juice is the only way to do it

occasionally a vinegar is nice
3075 2018-11-12 19:34:15 if your problem cannot be solved by 

• drinking water
• coconut oil
• brujeria/voodoo

your really fucked sis
3076 2018-11-12 19:34:00 Sis linda i think you should  boil water and then add sugar have that melt, add cooking oil and throw that mixture on that long weaved witched. U are too kind to them rerag....@Mzansimagic #HousekeepersMzansi
3077 2018-11-12 19:33:58 Have you tried NARS Pore & Shine? Doesn’t stop oil completely but it delays it for a lot longer
3078 2018-11-12 19:33:57 Don't you worry buttercup, it's on its way.   I would think that the criminal indictments and guilty pleas already on the books might shake your support of such a snake oil salesman, aka @realDonaldTrump, but more is to come.  Stay tuned...  :)
3079 2018-11-12 19:33:48 #oilandgas $OIH ETF for Oil Services broke under $20 today. This is the worst level since the 2001-2003 period. Admittedly, it's a wonky ETF that is hard to count with weightings -- but $XLE been disappointing too. And, steakhouses in Houston/Dallas still jam-packed and pricey.
3080 2018-11-12 19:33:37 WTI Crude Oil settled down $0.26, a record 11th consecutive close lower.
3081 2018-11-12 19:33:35 @sabre666 @BigMeatyClaws Raicher said oil to 90$ by Feb
3082 2018-11-12 19:33:35 who knows - the Saudi's might take their oil minister and cut him up into pieces just like they did the reporter Kashoggi? - so what would Trump do - NOTHING!  just as he has done - I guess with this much oil you can do whatever you want - like cut up a reporter in to pieces!!
3083 2018-11-12 19:33:31 dont forget about Trudeau trying his damndest to kill oil and gas.
3084 2018-11-12 19:33:24 U.S. CRUDE OIL FUTURES SETTLE AT $59.93/BBL, DOWN 26 CENTS, 0.43 PCT

3085 2018-11-12 19:33:22 Thank YOU! I already do the cubes in oil trick, but I'm always trying new ways to keep them fresh for longer in the fridge.
3086 2018-11-12 19:32:57 I should’ve waited to get my oil changed 
3087 2018-11-12 19:32:56 ايه وانا باصبعي الفه حولك ٣ لفاات بسم الله ماشاء الله
3088 2018-11-12 19:32:53 I didn't even get into land management policy reversals. Land users of BLM's no longer required to repair damage they incur. Expansion of oil/gas leasing despite historically low demand.
3089 2018-11-12 19:32:44 A death sentence given to a young man selling Dagga oil to the ill has stirred debate in Malaysia about its ultra-tough drug laws. The case has prompted calls for Malaysia become the first in Asia to legalise medical marijuana, but long-held stigma means change could come slowly.

3092 2018-11-12 19:32:20 Anyone notice how when crude oil moves higher that the price of gasoline at the pump rises the same day? So why is it when the price of crude plunges over several weeks, the price of gas at the pump does not drop? #FAKEMARKETS
3093 2018-11-12 19:32:18 I thought we were the biggest exporters? Why should we care what the price of oil is outside the US? WHY do we're even sell it to anyone else?
3094 2018-11-12 19:32:14 Will someone explain to me how every oil change place is crowded ALL THE TIME? I know some of y’all are out here getting monthly oil changes. It’s the only explanation
3095 2018-11-12 19:32:11 All this fuss about palm oil !  If it comes to a choice between palm oil and orang-utans I'll order gallons of the stuff.  Ugly, demon looking things. Yeugh!

3097 2018-11-12 19:31:59 Saudi Arabian oil IS the American economy. Please read Jerry Robinson's "Bankruptcy Of Our Nation" to know the real story...Nixon, Kissinger, and going off the gold standard.
3098 2018-11-12 19:31:59 The woman with the alabaster box kept her oil at the right time for ONE person, Christ. 

I wonder how many times she had to shove back the thought of selling it. I wonder how many times she had to honor what she was building by being quiet.
3099 2018-11-12 19:31:57 You did great Job ! Help economy to bring oil price down. #khashoogi And help #SaudiArabia by bringing Khassoggi 's murderers out of country in #Turkey @RT_Erdogan @AdelAljubeir @OPECSecretariat
3100 2018-11-12 19:31:53 Oh, wait MSM is the all knowing, all seeing prophet we should listen to? Is that what we should do? Because if y’all are saying Q is Snake Oil, what’s your suggestion as an alternative? What do you suggest? What’s your source?

3104 2018-11-12 19:31:35 It's got a block button.
3105 2018-11-12 19:31:30 i haven’t bought weed in so long (we sell oil) and i had a dream someone stole my fucking half oz i just bought 
3106 2018-11-12 19:31:26 Accidentally dropped a bolt in a barrel full of oil at worked today. Had to fish it out with my hand and my whole arm was covered in oil lol that stuff does not come off of your skin so easily
3107 2018-11-12 19:31:18 No one should really be surprised. Note that @UCSUSA were strong supporters of the Big Oil written AB 398 extension of the California cap-and-trade pollution trading program. When it comes to carbon casinos and #offsets @UCSUSA simply chooses soft climate science denial.
3108 2018-11-12 19:31:11 Charging stations work well, though, and if the source of THAT power is solar, then we’d be able to move towards all electric cars. The oil industry is too greedy and doesn’t want that to happen, though.
3109 2018-11-12 19:31:07 Taking my Jeep back to the dealership, they can have it  these oil changes too much damn money, tf
3110 2018-11-12 19:31:02 Have to get my oil changed but do I really HAVE to listen to Fox News?? #pleasehurry
3111 2018-11-12 19:30:57 We are poorer due to your looting strength that make the economy to collapsed. We thank God for bringing PMB to manage the $30 per Barrel of crude oil for us to survive in this country.

3113 2018-11-12 19:30:55 @suneetacosmetic hello I’m trying to buy your CBD oil but when I get to payment it says it has been refused  it’s doing this for all my cards so I think it’s a fault with the site. x
3114 2018-11-12 19:30:53 that advert about orangutan habitat that's going around is so overtly mawkish and manipulative it makes me want to do shots of palm oil every time it comes on my feed
3115 2018-11-12 19:30:48 Are you a palm oil free household? #justasking
3116 2018-11-12 19:30:30 @realDonaldTrump ..... but your time is too precious to spend it honoring the brave men and women of this country and abroad. But after all you have foung time in your agenda to criticize the Forest management dept in Cali, to worry about the Oil in the Middle East and Comcast

3118 2018-11-12 19:30:19 Mr. President, you promised in your speeches that you are bringing the oil prices down. Saudi Arabia is your closest friends in your international politics. Therefore you can make it happen that your tax releases are not been eaten up by high gasoline prices. You promised !!!!
3119 2018-11-12 19:30:15 ....technically he's right though. Iran can't buy aircraft parts no matter how much oil is they have. If europe decide as a reaction to us refusing to pay the debts that they'll close their borders, airspace, waterways and even fiber cables - aint them who is going to suffer.
3120 2018-11-12 19:30:06 News reported yesterday just the opposite, that Saudis WILL be cutting oil production n supply.
3121 2018-11-12 19:30:05 @bEATWEAKer I need some more of that oil bruh
Me and my girl was  cloud 9 nigga 
3122 2018-11-12 19:29:55 Because there are oil, medicines and chemicals in the Puget Sound. Also Victoria BC dumps all their sewers daily in these waters.
3123 2018-11-12 19:29:55 Impressed at Iceland's ability to convince people they're a nature conscious "green" organisation. Literally all they sell is heavily processed frozen meat and veg, but yeah, palm oil bad,  cartoon mini orangutans good
3124 2018-11-12 19:29:47 I put baby oil in my bath the other day and it was a saviour but that bath was deadly slippy
3125 2018-11-12 19:29:43 Car need a damn oil change already... fuck me 
3126 2018-11-12 19:29:39 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
3127 2018-11-12 19:29:37 Instead of worrying about Saudi cutting oil production I think we should worry about #JamalKhashoggi ‘s killer who’s still loose cutting bodies!!!

@realDonaldTrump
@POTUS
3130 2018-11-12 19:29:17 yes, cutting back on oil in our food is essential. This can only be driven by manufacturers. What is going on to raise that as an issue? Sustainable palm oil to meet world demand is an impossibility, based on current demand and future growth
3131 2018-11-12 19:29:14 Clinton GAVE THEM TWO REACTORS MORON!! AND FOOD AND OIL!!
3132 2018-11-12 19:29:13 A half-assed google search told me that Ginger was the essential oil to use to combat vertigo. That is why I smell like an old root now. That's all I'm ever going to say about it.
3133 2018-11-12 19:28:59 Iran has already begun to use the pipeline of the Turkish state company, BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation. This pipeline links the oil field Kirkuk, Iraq to the Turkish Port of Ceyhan. This pipeline was used by Daesh in 2015 to the profit of Erdogan.
3134 2018-11-12 19:28:54 Soon demand will plummit, and we will all go electric, so who cares about oil?

3138 2018-11-12 19:28:39 You ok with less “green” and ethical countries filling the void that Canadian oil would be filling?  How ungreen you are. Or do you have another agenda like landlocking CDN oil so US can buy it cheap, and harming CDN social programs along the way?
3139 2018-11-12 19:28:37 Oil should be moved from speculative market back to supply and demand market.
3140 2018-11-12 19:28:37 The top 3 African countries with the most crude oil reserves (Libya, Nigeria and Somalia) are all terrorized.
3141 2018-11-12 19:28:31 It's the same as bread and oil... It's actually not that crazy... I'm not talking about cooking oil but a nice extra virgin one.
3142 2018-11-12 19:28:26 He is literally clueless on how OPEC and oil prices work. OPEC cuts supply to keep oil prices up. Fall and Winter = less demand, which = less supply needed. #Greed is part of the problem. We need a #RealPresident one who isn't so ignorant on the subjects he tweets. #Not4Me4US
3143 2018-11-12 19:28:21 Hi there.  I just wanted to let you know I've since stopped buying your products due to your use of palm oil.  You claim your palm oil is sustainable.  Clearly you don't understand how corrupt and environmentally damaging the ENTIRE palm oil industry is, including sustainable.
3144 2018-11-12 19:28:20 life rn feels like a nice big glossy glob of oil paint being spread w a palette knife
3145 2018-11-12 19:28:18 By violating the Iran agreement you imposed sanctions not allowing them to sell us oil anymore. This is turn lowered the # of suppliers while demand remained the same, so S.A. took advantage and raised the prices. YOU CAUSED THIS #econ101 #doyourhomework #LiarInChief
3146 2018-11-12 19:28:13 It’s all a result of the negative media coverage of Trump anyway. People in other countries—hell, people in this country—have nothing else to base their opinion off of but the media. No surprise that 90% negative coverage has this effect. #EnemyofThePeople
3147 2018-11-12 19:28:08 With all the instability you are creating, of course oil prices will go up.
3148 2018-11-12 19:28:06 You don't seem to grasp basic business principles. Lower oil prices are not in OPEC's interests. Why don't you also tell DeBeers to flood the market with all the diamonds they are holding in storage? I am sure that will make sense to them...not!
3149 2018-11-12 19:28:04 Well, we were weaning ourselves off of oil, then you came along and set us back 25 years
3150 2018-11-12 19:27:59 We need to dump these terrorists and expand the US production.  Obstructionist Democrats need to get out of the way and stop it with their nonsensical regulations that hamstring our oil independence!

We can't trust OPEC they are all criminals!
3151 2018-11-12 19:27:55 $85 for an oil change 
3152 2018-11-12 19:27:55 Speak for yourself. Tens of thousands in NE Scotland lost their jobs because of the recent oil price crash. Remember NE Scotland? Where you promised a world class golf facility, hundreds of jobs etc? How’s that working out?? #falsepromises

3160 2018-11-12 19:27:21 Should've happened already. Some fans don't want to hear about Hall and the like any longer but in the end, that is what has hurt this team. Trade whoever you want but win the damn trade & that has yet to occur under Chiarelli w/ genuine NHL talent.
3161 2018-11-12 19:27:20 At current world prices of oil,our formula would have yielded lesser prices for Petrol 92 & A/Diesel on 10Nov compared to the recent price reductions announced by #FakeFM. For Petrol,global price (Sin/Platt's)has come down 20% since 10Oct & price reduction given last week was 6%

The reality of palm oil production needs telling to wider audiences
3165 2018-11-12 19:27:06 You cannot have the US$ price high and  oil down at the same time. You are being greedy Mr. Trump.
3166 2018-11-12 19:27:04 Imagine being alive in 1918 right before the industrial revolution and investing in Standard Oil and the railroad buisness. Yep..
3167 2018-11-12 19:27:03 Maybe we can invade them to secure our oil sources, oh wait, Republicans already tried that, didn't work
3168 2018-11-12 19:26:59 Ok Tommy where did you make your money? Would it be in coal, oil and a little gas. I can’t believe the balls on you people. 
Fn hypocrite
3169 2018-11-12 19:26:54 It’s about as easy to become a police officer as it is to change the oil in someones car.
3170 2018-11-12 19:26:49 So, Tump is long DJIA and short oil. Okay. Got it.
3171 2018-11-12 19:26:47 No, they should be much higher because of our environment! Btw there is not a huge supply of oil, so why are you saying that?
3172 2018-11-12 19:26:43 Crude oil Dec18 57 Puts trade 200 times
3173 2018-11-12 19:26:42 I need to get my oil changed this weekend
3174 2018-11-12 19:26:36 I hear this a lot. It's an everlasting arguement of understanding how the car works vs the magic driving box that takes me to work. Many make a living swapping tires or changing oil, but don't have to know anything about the transmission.
3175 2018-11-12 19:26:35 After initial euphoria regarding OPEC cuts to production oil price now barely changed from Friday’s close and struggling to stay above $60 a barrel.

3177 2018-11-12 19:26:28 @PeterSchiff Peter, I heard you talk about the oil market as a long-term play for the current economic crisis we are about to see. Do you have a specific oil stock or company that you recommend? Appreciate all of the help.
3178 2018-11-12 19:26:28 Hahaha oh man this is some ghetto oil changing right here.

My car wouldn't drive into a curb easily; it sits low.
3179 2018-11-12 19:26:23 Being marketed by the same people that brought us Trump University and Trump Steaks I imagine. Next up, Trump Swapland and Trump Snake Oil.
3180 2018-11-12 19:26:23 That's what im saying. They dont want palm oil in their products. So they add Lard, which is even MORE Destructive to animals and the environment.
3181 2018-11-12 19:26:22 President Trump
I think we will be sharing the benefit of reducing the Production of our oil
3182 2018-11-12 19:26:21 Why don't you ask the oil companies that hold their tankers out at sea so they can artificially inflate the supply.
3183 2018-11-12 19:26:16 I love it when you do the things necessary to build our economy quickly. Cheap oil is what America lives on. We may have to use something else in time but now we can get our economy running before that occurs.
3184 2018-11-12 19:26:06 it;s not just a short term effect. It has long term implications to many things. ability to attract investment for renewables as well as oil/gas, ability to retain our best engineers, and all the spin offs associated with it.
3185 2018-11-12 19:26:05 Because he’s a shameless huckster snake oil salesman.... Our country is turning into one of his classless gimmicks (steak, water, cheap ties, vodka....)
3186 2018-11-12 19:25:48 Oil of Oley soap helps
3187 2018-11-12 19:25:40 Oil gas start wars lets end it take over the indusrty. We know they have teslas documents. Forget money as in the bible it is materialistic. Do the right thing investors oil companies. We all need this you selk the rights to use it. Oil companies in our pocket. Lets get it done.
3188 2018-11-12 19:25:38 Maybe? But we have to consider the clueless nature of Trump(PS Voted for him), I mean he gets us into a protracted trade war, lays a shadow over tech & single handedly KILLS Oil&Gas markets? This after reducing REGS to bolster the sector & create JOBS?

3192 2018-11-12 19:25:15 ВСМЫСЛЕ??
3193 2018-11-12 19:24:57 Yes good point. That clearly protects against oil slump. They have $100m debt, significant growing cash balances and a clear plan to get to 110kboepd. Its a lot cheaper to do field development onshore and the free cash per annum at 110kboepd is roughly equiv to mkt cap today
3194 2018-11-12 19:24:55 since this morning that president is not at work preserving the market. All his tweets makes the market go down. He promised  great aidports,roads  but what he does is making USA a poor country. Not accenting a good price of crude oil will not be good for USA. Bad economist he is
3195 2018-11-12 19:24:50 So, what about coconut oil??
3196 2018-11-12 19:24:50 Who cares about OPEC??? Out boys here in Texas are happy to supply our oil!!! We don't want another bust!

3201 2018-11-12 19:24:27 @GeologyNick Now if oil corporate america lifts a finger to replace the fuel tank farm for the entire State of Wash. They knew about it for years now and engineering rated the site at F plus. No fuel 0 recovery from these events, there thinking is they have 700 years lol
3202 2018-11-12 19:24:23 Says you who is buying NO oil! Stay out of Saudi Arabia...
3203 2018-11-12 19:24:21 For decades this Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars of the oil revenue on terrorist activities. It's time for the people of Iran to ask #WhereIsTheOilMoney ?
3204 2018-11-12 19:24:18 Oh no mineral oil again
3205 2018-11-12 19:24:17 Oil is old and tired. #RenewableEnergy and #electric cars are the future, and making this shift will bring more jobs to Americans. And, our relationship with Saudi needs to be evaluated. #Yemen is falling apart with our arms as part of the attack.
3206 2018-11-12 19:24:17 I’m into that freaky shit like you putting me in a relaxing bath and giving me a hot oil massage when I get out.
3207 2018-11-12 19:24:06 Nothing to do with the oil. It's the Management quality that matters. We haven't had good management of our resources.
3208 2018-11-12 19:23:55 You have no idea how this works, right? OPEC prices are not based on amount of available oil.
3209 2018-11-12 19:23:49 I hope you’ll never work as car mechanic, on oil platform or anywhere near coal 
3210 2018-11-12 19:23:39 I wish he'd go back to singing for Midnight Oil
3211 2018-11-12 19:23:37 WILL US oil supply the USA?
OR will domestic oil continue to take advantage of world events as a reason to raise prices here?
3212 2018-11-12 19:23:31 I have a car shop and of all my cars the only ones I change the oil in myself are my diesel trucks 
3213 2018-11-12 19:23:23 With the term and money Chia has given players the next GM will have a hard time finding room to maneuver. Chia willingly painted the himself into a corner and paid for it this summer. What do you think he’d do to the future if he felt his job depended on it?
3214 2018-11-12 19:23:20 Thankful for having a warranty on my, car went for an oil change now need windshield wiper motor and top taillight replaced won't get the car until Friday ...

3217 2018-11-12 19:23:08 you really have NO idea how the oil markets work do you?
3218 2018-11-12 19:23:06 Are you trying to say you’ll forget about the dead and dismembered journalist in exchange for lower oil prices?
3219 2018-11-12 19:23:05 I thought the US was oil independent?  Have we been lied to?
3220 2018-11-12 19:23:03 Remember when you said you needed a oil change and you was gone find somebody to do it? 
3221 2018-11-12 19:23:02 Mr. President, you are losing some of your early and biggest supporters in states that have heavy oil and gas economies, ND, CO, NM, OK, TX, LA just to name a few. Remember 2008/2009 and 2015/2016? Knuckle Head!!
3222 2018-11-12 19:22:54 歯ブラシには参りました。私は今、子供用を使っています。fish oil のサプリの大きさったら、座薬ぐらいあります。でも安いので、我慢して飲んでいますが。なんでも大きい。

3225 2018-11-12 19:22:44 Cmon guy, you really think the selloff today was because of the mineral oil?  Its because of the classic sell the news and over inflation of the share price leading up.  No one who actually matters cares about INERT mineral oil!

3227 2018-11-12 19:22:37 Because the Senate knows exactly what rural America needs: the deregulation of safety standards for oil rigs. Those have apparently been holding us all back for the last few years they have been in place
3228 2018-11-12 19:22:37 Not to mention the suppression of all revolutionary elements and the Shi-ah population who live and work on that oil supply...

3230 2018-11-12 19:22:31 Guess who cut the oil supply? Trump did by replacing sanctions on Iran.

3232 2018-11-12 19:22:28 Does anyone know if $vktx uses mineral oil in their placebo? 
3233 2018-11-12 19:22:28 thanks, Oil & Pharma...lacking even the pretense of democracy...a German, a Pole, a Brit can only vote for one lowly slot, NOT for upper management
3234 2018-11-12 19:22:26 Must be tough being a teenager today with everyone telling you to stop using palm oil
3235 2018-11-12 19:22:25 "North Sea oil", not Scottish. Of COURSE it isn't Scottish. No need to even mention Scotland.
3236 2018-11-12 19:22:23 It's fine Kevin, come home.  It's normal to treat the oil industry how like a basket of scared kittens and gay kids should just figure it out. Our society isn't completely and utterly fucked.

3238 2018-11-12 19:22:07 While I’m not complaining this is very unusual for oil companies to lower prices before a holiday road trip
3239 2018-11-12 19:22:02 I’ve heard that. I’m in FL so we don’t have a need for heating oil, but my sister in law in RI said she is concerned about the cost of heating her house this winter
3240 2018-11-12 19:22:00 Trying to the weekly shop online with @Tesco post @IcelandFoods palm oil advert. It’s in everything. Can @Tesco tell me whether the palm oil in their products is sustainable for the rainforest?
3241 2018-11-12 19:21:54 I thought palm oil was a substitute for lard ?
3242 2018-11-12 19:21:48 And with no regard to the MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT explanations for the mineral oil claims? Or the fact that even if true, it still only brings risk down to 22%? Your concern isn't wrong. But its highlighting a message which emphasizes an almost irrelevant finding.
3243 2018-11-12 19:21:47 Oil industry important to GDP , not to mention millions of US jobs . Has Trump even thought this through ?
3244 2018-11-12 19:21:46 Count me in! He really shows off his skills in this episode: fire in the pan (in the pasta dish), pounding and tenderizing the meat, handling hot oil and deep frying...
3245 2018-11-12 19:21:42 Lots of private corporations, especially those with campuses have them (e.g., oil refineries, etc).
3246 2018-11-12 19:21:21 Stop importing other’s oil!  We have oil. Use it.

3249 2018-11-12 19:21:16 The sheer fact that this idiot can tweet something about what the price of oil should be, and said tweet changes the price of oil by even 1 cent, should tell us all everything we need to know about all the idiots involved in the oil trade.

3253 2018-11-12 19:20:53 For decades this Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars of the oil revenue on terrorist activities. It's time for the people of Iran to ask #WhereIsTheOilMoney ?
3254 2018-11-12 19:20:41 if oil closes red, we're headed for record breaking 11 day streak
3255 2018-11-12 19:20:36 If we were less dependent on oil, this would not matter, but you have dismantled research into alt energy source like solar and wind. Thank you for endangering our national security @realDonaldTrump !

3263 2018-11-12 19:20:10 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist
3264 2018-11-12 19:20:10 Oil prices are much higher now than they were.
Canada gets no benefit.
3265 2018-11-12 19:20:09 Good point about the OPEX figures! They’re some of the cheapest in the world which gives some confidence even in a low oil price environment

3269 2018-11-12 19:19:53 It came out good thankfully.  I was worried since last time I doubled the oil and it came out yummy. I was worried what following the directions would change about it.

3273 2018-11-12 19:19:30 First good rain is the biggest problem because of all the old oil on the road. When I lived in Oregon it was never a problem because it rained alott+constantly cleaned the roads.
When I moved to Southern California I braked(20mph) after the first rain+slowly slid into a van.

3279 2018-11-12 19:19:09 You gave the oil companies permission to make as much profit as possible.

3291 2018-11-12 19:18:43 It is an insult to the common people to say that nothing changed after the coup, this is so wrong.

Everything changed;

People are now killed by military in uniform in broad daylight, Mugabe was more discreet. Bread now $1,50 fro $0,90, cooking oil $9 from $3,80.

We are doomed!
3292 2018-11-12 19:18:43 Put on baby oil
3293 2018-11-12 19:18:41 Man this sucks. I'm in so much friggin pain and i need to put oil in my truck but the hood latch is wedged behind my bumper  I can barely even pick up my kid or do the most basic shit. I hope this smooths out soon. Idk how much more I can take
3294 2018-11-12 19:18:36 How about we... I don't know... Not gut the EPA and work on becoming less dependent on oil as a country?  Try that.
3295 2018-11-12 19:18:33 Is it Halal to get oil from Saudis on deferred payment? If the rupee depreciates further against the dollar in future we will be paying a higher price than what we would pay now... Is that extra money Sood/Riba?
3296 2018-11-12 19:18:28 Forget oil. Tesla’s Tower of Power
We need this electric cars powered by our own earth. Never need a charge. The middle east will sink without oil unless you need sand lol. The earth is our electricity. Just get oil compsnies aboard they only ones holding it back. You know this.

3298 2018-11-12 19:18:17 Yep lets stop buying oil from opec
3299 2018-11-12 19:18:17 Don't worry the Saudis are currently consumed with cutting off heads to be bothered with cutting oil production.
3300 2018-11-12 19:18:08 Great--a new market for AB oil. Oh...right.
3301 2018-11-12 19:17:54 @Oil_Drop Agree with your longer-term view of Oilers roster. Does that mean Chiarelli should start moving the deck chairs now to get younger talent? Or wait for some current farmhands to develop? I'm sure he asks himself the same question.

3305 2018-11-12 19:17:49 Uh, we don't want him!! He'll just come here to explain his Forest Management plan: cut down trees, cut roads in. And then let the oil companies and miners for destroy what's left 

That man would fit right in, in Brazil -- where they deforest ~25,000 acres of the Amazon a *day*.
3306 2018-11-12 19:17:29 Why was oil prices lower when Obama was in office? Not that the president has much influence on oil prices. Just sayin!
3307 2018-11-12 19:17:28 Your local Mr Delivery butcher. Wow just Wow.. but then I hear they slaughter animals in Dainfern estate much to the disgust of white neighbors.. cultures don’t mix it’s like oil and water

3310 2018-11-12 19:17:03 U.S. crude prices turned negative, reversing course as U.S.  President Donald Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output  reductions, after Saudi Arabia said OPEC was considering cutting supply  next year, citing softening demand.
3311 2018-11-12 19:16:59 It's not because if greedy oil companies and billion dollar quarterly profits.
3312 2018-11-12 19:16:52 Changing oil
3313 2018-11-12 19:16:48 Trump forgets Saudi and Russia could turn oil spigots on (26$/B)and grind Permian, stk market and economy into dust not to mention destroy S&P. Also perfect sidekick to his China tariff threat! Thx, Happy Holidays Donald.
3314 2018-11-12 19:16:37 Hopefully we can evolve and progress into a more renewable energy and bury oil and their dirty business practices once an for all.

3316 2018-11-12 19:16:24 Trump is a man who has gone into bankruptcy 3 times, and installed 2 large donors to his campaign into positions of power in his cabinet, and then also installed the head of both "big pharma" and "big oil" into positions of government they should be opposed to. He's for himself.
3317 2018-11-12 19:16:23 i try to put a mix of rosemary and jojoba oil in my hair for like 15+ min once a week. there are tons of easy diy hair masks u can look up!! even olive oil could do the trick
3318 2018-11-12 19:16:22 It would be nice to put sanctions on Saudi Oil and stop the practice of U.S. Presidents bowing down to Saudi princes.
3319 2018-11-12 19:16:18 @PremierFoods_FS can you confirm whether you will be changing to sustainable palm oil in your products?

3322 2018-11-12 19:16:12 How did you ever get that Wharton MBA??? Daddy buy it for you? Of course OPEC and Saudi’s will cut oil production, that’s how you stabilize prices by managing supply. What a moron!
3323 2018-11-12 19:16:08 Transition to renewables so we don’t rely on foreign oil and their corrupt governments.

3327 2018-11-12 19:15:47 If we are now an exporter of energy why are we talking about OPEC and oil prices are companies should be dropping our oil prices unless we're owned by OPEC
3328 2018-11-12 19:15:41 ДД? Я туплю, что это?
3329 2018-11-12 19:15:29 Wait, why do we need their oil when we have enough of our own supply? Shouldn't be self-sufficient by now as you promised? Or you have business deals with your Saudi buddies?
3330 2018-11-12 19:15:27 @Oil_Drop Inferior baseball is better than no baseball at all, I agree. But I'd give a lot to see the strategies and inside moves of this sport come back.
3331 2018-11-12 19:15:23 Awesome bunch in there. Been on a bike for 10+ but can’t change the oil. Really should do the same. Welcome to 2 wheels 
3332 2018-11-12 19:15:18 Do we know how the beacon would have been lit?  Don’t think candles would have sufficed to put out enough light.  Burning vats of oil?  I really have no idea.
3333 2018-11-12 19:15:13 One of the poorest countries is making the change while Canada one of the richest is filling up on oil and then taxing Canadians for the oil companies he approved.

3335 2018-11-12 19:15:01 Thank you and congratulations as first POTUS to truly realize how the cost of oil/gas (energy) directly effects Families, economy & consumer confidence. Every dollar saved at pump is spent on essential Family needs. Continue GREAT work. Drain Swamp!
3336 2018-11-12 19:14:56 apparently castor oil is a laxative, but acts as a stimulant to the bowels & vagal nerve which can naturally jump start labor. You can buy it at the grocery store. If you do intend on using it, make sure to keep hydrated & take it like a shot w/ sunny d early in the morning.
3337 2018-11-12 19:14:48 Dove is my brand of choice and I'd love to keep using it, do you have any plans to stop using palm oil or it's derivatives?
3338 2018-11-12 19:14:24 Right, like you're not putting pressure on them to drop prices over Khashoggi. I can just hear the conversation, "Look, you guys really messed up, but I need cheap gas to make me look good, so increase oil production and I'll turn my head the other way."
3339 2018-11-12 19:14:21 Yes sir but I'll even settle for today's diluted facsimile ;)
3340 2018-11-12 19:14:12 Drumpf and his oil magnate friends wants to keep going for a long time. Bad enough he thinks coal is pure/clean. Doesn’t care about the health/environmental hazards. :/
3341 2018-11-12 19:14:08 Thats indeed very laudable and commendable sir. That is the way to go.

More oil on your head, and power to your elbows sir!!
3342 2018-11-12 19:14:00 Of course na that BRT female drivers dey surprise me
3343 2018-11-12 19:13:58 So full of shit, we shall see with the planned EU ban on Palm Oil where your priorities are.
3344 2018-11-12 19:13:57 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid anti-dandruff shampoo. Eat well. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or similar? What must I do to uncover the legitimate url. Really want it. So healthy.
3345 2018-11-12 19:13:48 He uses olive oil 
At least that's what he said in some video cooking something in the tour bus
3346 2018-11-12 19:13:38 Genius advertising tactic too by @IcelandFoods; 1: who can resist the temptation to watch a ‘banned’ advert & 2: Why pay millions to have broadcast on tv if social media will share to a similar sized audience for free. Can they will substitute palm oil with more  rapeseed oil?

3352 2018-11-12 19:13:01 I always find myself baffled and confused by your tweets. I thought the XL Keystone Pipeline was going to make us energy independent and never have to worry about foreign oil again, What happened? Were we lied too again, kind of like N.Korea and the Migrant Caravan invasion?
3353 2018-11-12 19:12:57 What's even wrong with us on this Twitter , so we shouldn't state the fact That Mr Peter Obi is a renowned ethnic bigot backed up with fact.

3355 2018-11-12 19:12:50 And in five years, when our oil is gone and we lose the resource, what happens then?  What if we go to war and the works cuts off our oil supply?  Use horse and buggy to move around?  Maybe not extracting is in our best interest?
3356 2018-11-12 19:12:45 A friend forwarded this to me just now. Forwarding this as precautionary measure:

"Please be careful everyone. There is oil spill on the main Shahra e Faisal road, from FTC building till Nursery. (Road side: Nursery to Airport). Many bikes, Cars and Rickshaws had accident."

3358 2018-11-12 19:12:22 And Trump wants oil prices in the US to go down not up.  His base pretty much only drives vehicles that get less that 20 mpg and generally have to commute decent distances in rural areas.

3361 2018-11-12 19:12:17 It’s almost as if the oil industry typed that up for you to print.
3362 2018-11-12 19:12:16 Interesting to note the succession of tweets from @realDonaldTrump. First, a complaint about the stock market, then two attempts to manipulate cable  stocks and oil prices.  Does someone (who should be divested from these things) have a financial interest in both?
3363 2018-11-12 19:12:16 Agreed. As for the current roster, the argument could be made for as little as two and at most five (not including Bouchard or any other kid who isn't currently in Edmonton) Not a good look for a team already into year four of Connor McDavid.

3365 2018-11-12 19:12:10 why ... not his oil ...
3366 2018-11-12 19:12:07 Yet another reason to #Resign. RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3367 2018-11-12 19:12:07 I think it's probably the advertising standards authority. I'm sure Iceland could have made an ad that included the plight of the rainforest / orangutans and their pledge to cut palm oil from own brand products without sanction, but this 'ban' got them more for their buck

3369 2018-11-12 19:12:04 Smart, worry about a few dollars in oil thinking it helps your votes and ignore continue to push KSA away from the petrodollar, lets see if those ramifications are more damaging...
3370 2018-11-12 19:12:01 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3371 2018-11-12 19:11:56 When in government you can reverse anything. Cut down the trees, drill for oil, take buses of the roads, build more prisons....
3372 2018-11-12 19:11:54 We have @PeterEgan6 to thank for the list. Thank you  Peter. 

I believe that sustainable palm oil is probably better than asking for a complete ban on palm oil so I am currently 

1. comparing the items I buy against that list
2. checking what they say about sustainability
3373 2018-11-12 19:11:49 Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said earlier Monday that OPEC and its allies should reverse about half the increase in oil output they made earlier this year. Great time for the #weald to start producing #ukog #angus
3374 2018-11-12 19:11:39 So why do we sell u.s. oil overseas and buy imported oil and gasoline ? It's called screw the consumer !
3375 2018-11-12 19:11:36 That, but also: why would one of the largest oil producing countries in the world want low oil prices? The stupidity of a certain POTUS knows no bounds
3376 2018-11-12 19:11:35 Today would be a straight day to do a double but I need my oil changed badly
3377 2018-11-12 19:11:34 I love the feeling of peppermint oil on my scalp
3378 2018-11-12 19:11:30 tell me how I went to get an oil change and left with a brand new car
3379 2018-11-12 19:11:26 I.e there too much supply,....the correct BUSINESS decision is to cut production, for both US oil producers @US_OGA & #OPEC. @PowerLunch @BeckyQuick @TheDomino #oil #wti #brent
3380 2018-11-12 19:11:22 $61 for my oil change & dats wit $20 off.. why must I gotta be a adult 
3381 2018-11-12 19:11:19 US should stop buying oil from the Saudi's. In fact US needs to place embargo's on the Saudi's that country is no better than Iran
3382 2018-11-12 19:11:18 I love halving them and drizzling olive oil in an 8x8 glass dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. I like adding small pieces of pancetta as well. Oven at 350 for about 30-40 minutes.
3383 2018-11-12 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: chewy crust with spicy motor oil and philly beef.
3384 2018-11-12 19:10:39 Are you for real bro? Maybe whoever has been making the ones you have been seeing doesn't put enough oil in them....
3385 2018-11-12 19:10:30 If US is 100% energy independent. We must not export our crude oil, coal, or natural gas. It's our way of participation in climate change. We should export technologies for solar and wind energy. OPEC is like the last gas station before you cross the desert, highway robbery.
3386 2018-11-12 19:10:29 We will not cut oil production  if countries do not seek to isolate us over the disastrous assassination of Jamal  Khashoggi that we carried in Turkey last month. I have accepted responsibility  and seek to compensate Jamal 's loved ones

Time to think about how many gas pumps, propane tanks, gas filled cars PROPELLED the fires???  Solarize + electric cars!!

3401 2018-11-12 19:09:26 @ProcterGamble As a life long user of Head And Shoulders shampoo, I was extremely disappointed to discover it contains Palm Oil, which is destroying Orangutan habitat.  When/if you amend the constituents, I will reconsider my policy!
3402 2018-11-12 19:09:26 We should allow Iran to trade Oil for Food, from USA, use third party to take the oil
3403 2018-11-12 19:09:24 Big, If True! RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3404 2018-11-12 19:09:20 Gettin my oil changed, and the mechanic noticed my Honda’s  engine says V8 Hemi. He laughed and showed the other mechanic but still won’t race me though.
3405 2018-11-12 19:09:14 Lamb chops are nice with olive oil salt pepper and paprika and a touch of mint then leave them out so they’re room temp before cooking and then in a pan drizzle of olive oil couple of crushed garlic cloves and diced onion salt pepper and then add spinach till it’s wilted 
3406 2018-11-12 19:09:10 Shouldn’t t you be paying your respects at Arlington instead of tweeting about oil prices? #DoYourJob
3407 2018-11-12 19:08:38 Judge Morris just cut oil production by blocking energy production from the Keystone XL Pipeline. Needs to go directly to SCOTUS. Bypass 9th Circuit. Tens of thousands of people's livelihoods are being disrupted. Socialism is not about production, it is about redistribution.
3408 2018-11-12 19:08:37 You are the worst leader we could have at the worst time possible. #Climatechange is real, and continuing to burn fossil fuels is bringing us to brink of catastrophe. We are in a crisis, and need to cut down on the use of oil & other fossil fuels. OPEC needs to cut production.
3409 2018-11-12 19:08:37 That previous conservative governments left massive infrastructure debt, regularly cutting health and education so that oil companies could make record profits?

3415 2018-11-12 19:08:06 DrG, "Snake Oil" is telling the opposition what you're going to do before you do it. Disinformation was part of the plan, plus Q told us to do our own research, not what to believe.
3416 2018-11-12 19:07:58 controversial opinion: the Iceland palm oil ad is political in nature and shouldn't be aired because to ease the rules for one organisation will set a precedence for many more political ads, many of which you may not ideologically agree with
3417 2018-11-12 19:07:47 You have your fingers in too many pies and now your fingers are getting burnt. This is what happens when you make promises you can't keep. You promised the Saudis you would end Iranians oil export then allowed 8 countries to purchase it. You can't have it both ways
3418 2018-11-12 19:07:43 Does anyone know if @Oreo uses sustainable palm oil? I have seen mixed things about it online
3419 2018-11-12 19:07:39 You say you want oil prices down,  you do stop the deal with Iran meaning oil can only go up. Methinks your paymasters whoever they are want the oil price up.
3420 2018-11-12 19:07:38 I've never used avocado oil before. I'm gonna give it a try. Thanks for the tip
3421 2018-11-12 19:07:32 how about we use our own oil and let the world figure out their own shit
3422 2018-11-12 19:07:20 So Nehemiah hair will finally stay in braids,but the probably is that he has 3 different hair textures. These straight oil pieces in the back is not going for it. #mixedbabyproblems
3423 2018-11-12 19:07:20 The Kochs and Putin rushed their attempt to takeover the USA because their financial base, oil and coal are rapidly declining in use. Faster than they anticipated. This proves to be their downfall. They got sloppy. The Kochs are also in their 80s. David, ill.
3424 2018-11-12 19:07:18 Currently waiting at the dealership getting my man's jeep oil changed and all that good stuff after washing and vacuuming it out. #wifey #jeepfam #lovehim
3425 2018-11-12 19:07:13 Hopefully, we learn to move beyond our insatiable thirst for oil. It’s killing us all.
3426 2018-11-12 19:07:12 Being an adult is so fucking hard. My tires are basically bald, I need an oil change. Taxes are coming up before I know it. Christmas presents. Credit debt from a failed business. I just wanna be in that next bracket so bad. I’m tired of struggling
3427 2018-11-12 19:07:12 can't use logic with DJT. Use reverse psychology instead.

@realDonaldTrump I hear Nancy Pelosi wants low oil prices!  She knows the Dems can bring oil prices down.
3428 2018-11-12 19:07:11 .The issue is not which country has done it ,its about viability and profitability , Nigeria a top oil producer

3430 2018-11-12 19:06:55 In case someone out there is curious about an honest review of #cbd oil. 

I took as directed, for sleep, by the book. It did not help me. It didn't help me relax, sleep, fall asleep or stay asleep. 

Did it help you?
3431 2018-11-12 19:06:54 Palm oil killing our planet. Countless wars over crude oil. There must be another way
3432 2018-11-12 19:06:50 @Oil_Drop Rob, your reminders lead to an interesting question: as (when, if) Oilers move closer to top level, how many current players can be considered essential in the march? Not many, I'm afraid.
3433 2018-11-12 19:06:47 Brazil urgently needs to explore "PRÉ SAL" "start and export oil
3434 2018-11-12 19:06:46 We should be sanctioning the Saudis not kissing their ass and hoping they don’t lower oil production.
3435 2018-11-12 19:06:43 So I was gonna get my oil changed today buutttt my card won’t work and I just wanna know who’s trynna steal my identity b/c I’m not that great
3436 2018-11-12 19:06:36 Don, I don't get it, you told us that we were energy self sufficient.
Why do we need their oil anymore? 
What about Clean Coal and drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Reserve or along Florida's and California coast.
How about renewable energy instead Don?
What the Frac Don ???

3438 2018-11-12 19:06:23 Give residency to their student doctors?  What does that have to do with anything?  I can agree with the politics of this (oil, weapons, etc) but when you go there, you’re stoking fear of all Saudi’s and not ALL of them are bad.  Some of them work their tails off to help people.
3439 2018-11-12 19:06:15 The price of gas shot up at the start of your administration only because of your efforts to keep it high to favor higher oil prices for Putin.
3440 2018-11-12 19:06:11 So glad the price of oil upsets you, but not the murder of an American journalist. I see your priorities are in "order."
3441 2018-11-12 19:06:02 @OPECnews @OPECSecretariat  Cut the oil! Buy electric! Ditch the petrochemical empire & the cronies that waged war & political skulduggery on behalf of dead fossil fuels. Ditch OPEC. Thank you @BarackObama for making sure America produces our own oil and isn’t dependent on OPEC!
3442 2018-11-12 19:05:55 So i am at work walking down an aisle and see that some fucking person takes a lid off of an oil bottle and pores enough of it on the floor to fucking slip and then just leaves the open bottle on the shelf. You know how long it took me to clean it up? Dont even ask. Im over today

3448 2018-11-12 19:05:06 #Daesh groups hiding in the desert are continually trying to raid the oil fields. Notably #Tanak. These attacks have gotten repetitive. Because of this, the #Coalition has stepped up observation. Today, one raiding party was completely destroyed.
3449 2018-11-12 19:05:05 The sanctions are still hurtful, but it also helps Russia to become more independent as e.g. the country is finally designing its own huge power turbines to not depend on Siemens. & RU is now developing its own shale oil/gas techniques and is even trying to market it to Qatar etc
3450 2018-11-12 19:04:56 Fair enough. Just wondered if the house of 9 ghosts with oil fired heating that i know of could be explained that way
3451 2018-11-12 19:04:43 So why is she all over the media lately? On CBC and Global in Edmonton today, tweeting about US exporting Alberta's oil, and we only get $17 for our oil,, everyone else gets $70. And why does she say "our oil", she's in BC.
3452 2018-11-12 19:04:42 We called in the professionals. They tortured us all for 3 months. Even the cats rebelled and threatened us with no cuddles or love, if we didn’t take action. Trap and release was the method used. Told to use eucalyptus oil on old socks, and toss in attic to keep them out.
3453 2018-11-12 19:04:37 That is comic relief, when Saudi is the one pushing oil output per Trump!
3454 2018-11-12 19:04:32 You apparently don't understand what happens when oil prices go low. Too much of a good thing is never good. Yes, I can drive a few more miles for less but many people are forced out of a job because it becomes less productive to drill, less productive to explore.
3455 2018-11-12 19:04:31 Yay for oil spills!
3456 2018-11-12 19:04:19 I went to Neals Yard, Islington, @NYR_Official  they made a beard oil for me, avocado oil with ravitsar, it’s lush cost a tenner. They took me through loads of different scents too, great fun

3458 2018-11-12 19:04:14 Brent Crude and Western Texas Intermediate are down 50% and 40% respectively from their oil boom prices. The industry is doing better, but, globally, oil has not recovered to its pre-2014 levels and may never will. Those are the facts. Sorry that you don’t like ‘em.

3461 2018-11-12 19:04:03 RT realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production without my pants. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3462 2018-11-12 19:03:50 You might also consider stopping using HSBC as your bank, since they are one of the main investors in palm oil, or do they have you locked in too tightly?
3463 2018-11-12 19:03:38 You get that oil is running out right??? That once it's gone it's really gone??? Nope, didn't think so. You ignorance is still astounding!
3464 2018-11-12 19:03:33 Palm Oil has 100 different names, including Sodium Laurel Sulphate, the ingredient that makes your shampoo sudsy. Do your research. Avoid at all cost and convenience.

3466 2018-11-12 19:03:29 If anyone has blue teeth, they're doing something wrong. Have you got your tube of ultramarine oil paint mixed up with your toothpaste, @TwittleyJules?
3467 2018-11-12 19:03:25 The more I read about this, the more clear it becomes that this was pre-planned to be banned - the rules were clear, they had a history of being behind others in terms of removing palm oil and needed a good PR story to help improve their image.
3468 2018-11-12 19:03:23 USD going stronger, Brexit talks creating uncertainty, OPEC to cut oil supply - markets in need for catalysts to be able to weather storm. €/$ down to 1.1240! But rates continue to rise -> rates is my safe play for 2018!

3470 2018-11-12 19:03:20 If you have dry skin & uneven skin tone like me I highly recommend Aveno Brightening Cleanser,  witch hazel, & Argan oil!  In that order, once a day, & I swear you will see a difference in no time!  
3471 2018-11-12 19:03:15 Apologies for my flippancy,hats off to you for all the hours spent burning the midnight oil to give us your revisionist account of our shared history. I don't think you have covered the social aspects, ie rents rising and wage poor, homelessness,CWC, but yet to finish your art.
3472 2018-11-12 19:03:14 Snake Oil back in the day was most commonly cannabis oil. Oh, it usually worked. Just sayin'. No coincidences.
3473 2018-11-12 19:03:09 If coal oil and gas weren’t used we would have no forests left. You and I wouldn’t be talking online.
3474 2018-11-12 19:03:07 Just for the record: I DO NOT want to be 'brought together', 'seek common ground', do contortions to 'give benefit of doubt' or in ANY WAY accept/tolerate Trumpanzees - I am more than fine with ostracizing & eradicating #GOPNazis - #FuckYourHighRoad. No oil for squeaky wheels!
3475 2018-11-12 19:03:05 @MariaBartiromo ...or oil could be down as forecast of economic slump???
3476 2018-11-12 19:03:00 #Iransanctions waivers = Iran can export ~ 1mn b/d for ~6mo. As #OPEC recalculates, #SaudiArabia says 1mn b/d prod cut needed, will cut 500k b/d itself. Trump can't have cake and eat it too on Iran and oil price, but would WH try to leverage threat of #Khashoggi sanctions on KSA?
3477 2018-11-12 19:02:56 This is our oil and we sell it with the price we want okay?

3482 2018-11-12 19:02:26 The denial of access to Western tech is minimal. E.g. power turbines are allowed to be sold in RU but not Crimea or thermal imaging components that are used in Russian arms. Otherwise even shale oil technologies are sold to Russia by Schlumberger in a way to circumvent sanctions.
3483 2018-11-12 19:02:25 Oil change too
3484 2018-11-12 19:02:22 Just spent a not quite rent level of money on my car, realized it was 3 oil changes away from 150k miles, and affectionately struck it, calling it a dingus
3485 2018-11-12 19:02:10 Yeah, WHO CARES they “allegedly” murdered Kashoggi on Consulate grounds?! As long as we get oil!!
3486 2018-11-12 19:02:08 Trump believes that the move of oil prices according to his wishes and not the wishes of supply and demand and say the offer is large and ignore the demand

3488 2018-11-12 19:02:04 So what oil is best for frying?
3489 2018-11-12 19:02:00 So what is the real cost of oil to run our ICE vehicles cheaply? How many trillions of dollars and human lives are needed to keep the price of oil and gas low so that we have a great economy? Its time to hedge our here so we can become better - don't you think?
3490 2018-11-12 19:01:59 Thanks to your @EPA we will still be hooked on oil. #solarenergy #solarpower
3491 2018-11-12 19:01:58 Your flip flopping on Iran’s oil sanctions is what caused this fiasco! Did your nanny read the story to you about the kid that cried Wolf to you when you were young? Oops I forgot you don’t do books Ask an adult to explain it to you LOL
3492 2018-11-12 19:01:58 My five favourite non-human loves are:
1. Our cats Luna and Buzz
2. Scotland
3. Our book collection (spread over 7 rooms!)
4. Good olive oil
5. My paella pan

I nominate @DaringOptimist @MattGovernor @Artology and @anoara_a
3493 2018-11-12 19:01:58 U pulled out of Iran deal. Subsequent sanctions sent prices up. U threatened military action on Venezuela, prices went up. Your tweets put up pressure on oil prices. OPEC is not monopoly, an oligarchy. You under cut our independence asking for 2 mil barrels from Saudi's. Dufus!!
3494 2018-11-12 19:01:54 Turnips are full of nutrients and are utterly delicious roasted w/ olive oil, s&p, as well as part of a melange with other root veggies. Why block? What this country needs is a turnip at every Thanksgiving!
3495 2018-11-12 19:01:52 Hopefully, lower oil prices & a glut of oil will mean our western lands are safer from sales & leases to oil companies. Also no one will want to buy or lease off-shore parcels as it would be too expensive to begin production from scratch.
3496 2018-11-12 19:01:51 Saudi Crown Prince murdered a USA permanent resident ...  and you are worried about their oil production Mr. President?! .@FoxNews .@CNN .@realDonaldTrump  .@POTUS .@tedcruz .@JohnCornyn .@senatemajldr .@HouseDemocrats .@BetoORourke .@MeganMitchell .@tedlieu
3497 2018-11-12 19:01:49 Maybe Justin can tell us the truth.  Trump & GOP and everyone invested in keeping the price of oil down SURE WON’T!!!

3500 2018-11-12 19:01:29 THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE OIL GLUT JUST FOR A FEW DAYS---NOW SAUDI IS CURTAILING OIL OUTPUT TO KEEP THEIR $$$$ HIGH?
YOU KNEW THIS ALL ALONG?

3502 2018-11-12 19:01:26 He also said mineral oil was reviewed and approved by the FDA for the study.
3503 2018-11-12 19:01:18 おはよう
3504 2018-11-12 19:01:18 I didn’t seal it and the first thing I noticed on applying the oil was its ability to drink the stuff.. and leave a full finish as you say..!? I will endeavour to wax seal and buff to remedy my error.. thanks for the advice Sir.. 
3505 2018-11-12 19:01:16 Perhaps they will not like it when the process of new off shore drilling becomes longer and longer, oh, what planning application. There are many ways to persuade oil companies to "help"..!

Please give me money!
3515 2018-11-12 19:00:25 Canada is the leader in the use of amines to process our hydrocarbons. Not only for CO2 but sulphur gases as well.If we kept all of our resources in the ground other countries would take up the production slack with higher emitting sources. New tech might knock AB oil prod in 1/2
3516 2018-11-12 19:00:24 You do not deserve abuse, I never agree with internet abuse and bullying, it is always wrong. However, you think the animals want the abuse they get by the destruction of their habitat, caused by the palm oil industry? This is why people are so upset.

3521 2018-11-12 19:00:13 Oil is used to make countless products.
3522 2018-11-12 19:00:05 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3523 2018-11-12 19:00:04 Why are we busy drilling new oil wells ? Where is our oil going ? Where is the oil from the Dakotas ? IN YOUR BUDDIES POCKETS ! SO SHUT UP ABOUT OPEC !
3524 2018-11-12 19:00:01 Earth Blend cheese uses sustainable palm oil and that's so great!!
3525 2018-11-12 18:59:55 Hopefully?!? You seem to know less than most Americans about the economy, foreign policy and oil.
3526 2018-11-12 18:59:52 Well Saudi Arabia is poised to raise the price of oil higher. On the global market. Canada needs to step up in securing lower oil prices for Canadians across the country, that would mean pipe lines from BC, Alberta to Newfoundland.

3536 2018-11-12 18:59:09 Hopefully we can ditch oil and the global elite can find something else to squabble over
3537 2018-11-12 18:59:08 lots and lots of walking, spicy food, raspberry tea, my cousin took a spoonful of oil you would have to do reasearch on that cause idk 
3538 2018-11-12 18:59:08 kaunse oil mein? Please use high quality oil, I am a very quality conscious person.
3539 2018-11-12 18:58:52 That sound that cooking oil makes before it lands on your chest. That’s the sound @burnaboy was referring to when he said “when the gbedu de enter body”.

3541 2018-11-12 18:58:48 Are you kidding me?  You're willing to let MBS and the KING get away with MURDERING a JOURNALIST (Jamal Kasogi), but not raise prices on OIL? This coming from all the @FoxNews voices in your head? It must be crowded up there.
3542 2018-11-12 18:58:43 Global markets are having a very big day (dollar up, stock market down, oil up ...) but #bitcoin is hardly moving.

Probably another sign that financial institutions still have very limited exposure to the #crypto space.

3544 2018-11-12 18:58:32 TA is snake oil? Making money trading crypto is way less stressful than playing poker. Since I learned to trade I’ve barely played poker. Trading crypto > poker imo
3545 2018-11-12 18:58:26 Every time they do that.they screw this country with high gas and oil prices.this is one area hate bush getting gas and oil put on the stock Exchange. Cause they in the oil business.  Trump 
3546 2018-11-12 18:58:14 Last time Trump mentioned placing sanctions on SA, oil ripped -- and topped out. Now he wants it lower at February lows? With possible conflict in middle east brewing. $USO green even today...
3547 2018-11-12 18:58:12 I literally got a discount on getting the oil changed in my car bc I’m named after a car part 
3548 2018-11-12 18:58:12 I remember, when this country had a real president, that oil price was $1/gallon cheaper.
3549 2018-11-12 18:58:07 No reason for more than $60 a barrel with all the oil
3550 2018-11-12 18:57:59 Of course I didn't include the multi trillion dollars wars in middle East we fought to support our allies there. These allies happen to share no values whatsoever with us. Yet they are our best buddies because they have oil. Time to treat oil as conflict mineral don't you think?
3551 2018-11-12 18:57:59 The sanction's input in the Russian economy troubles in 2015-2016 was just about 0.5% of GDP versus more than 3% of GDP lost due to the sharp downfall of oil prices at the time. So while, of course, the sanctions are harmful and Russia wants them removed, they are not thatcrucial
3552 2018-11-12 18:57:58 As expected. No surprise. USA needs lower oil prices in order to slow Chinese economy. The others all are only details.
3553 2018-11-12 18:57:51 British govt refuse to do the biding of @MBuhari, he is resorting self help. Diezane is the best oil minister ever

3555 2018-11-12 18:57:35 Oil not in the cad trade at all. The 0.75 level breaks there’s gonna be weak hands shaken out.  After being in Vancouver now several times this year and researching house values that look like garbage i agree. Canadian housing bubble.
3556 2018-11-12 18:57:29 Something tells me they will since you're tweeting about it and oil has been plummeting all week.
3557 2018-11-12 18:57:29 $AMRN   Once again,  controversy is ridiculous.   John Theros, CEO,  clearly on CNBC just said the placebo was INERT Mineral Oil.
3558 2018-11-12 18:57:27 @MNT_AnaSandoiu Isn't the headline about fish oil a bit deceiving when your article itself says, "Overall, fish oil supplements reduced the risk of a heart attack by approximately 28 percent. Among African-Americans, fish oil supplements lowered this risk by 77 percent" ??
3559 2018-11-12 18:57:23 When there is a over abundance of oil is when true leadership comes up with policies that reduces demand.

3568 2018-11-12 18:56:42 It should be much lower based on your boasting that “we are now the World’s #1 oil producer” a couple months back...we’re watching and 2020 will be here in a flash. Please BUILD IT.
3569 2018-11-12 18:56:40 Paper ballots as you’ve seen is the easiest way to cheat our election.

You flip flop more than any human on earth. It must have to do with your market shares..or lack of them.

How many companies do you have in Saudi Arabia? 8 I think? All in oil type companies, hidden in the shell of trump properties?

3575 2018-11-12 18:56:20 Trump should order the ending of exporting 6.3 millions of oil products a day and there will be a sharp sell-off in price. #Commodities #Oil #Energy
3576 2018-11-12 18:56:19 Not too transparent...  you rely on Saudi money, so the U.S. is supposed to kowtow before this murderous regime so that they won't 'cut oil production?!'  If you have such vaunted negotiating skills, why would our 'friends' do that?
3577 2018-11-12 18:56:13 Trump I thought you were the expert at the Art Of The Deal you overlooked and let the Prince  of Saudi Arabia get away with murder and you didn’t get increased oil production as part of their concessions?
3578 2018-11-12 18:56:13 All u nid is oil, and u slam them with sanctions
3579 2018-11-12 18:56:12 Amarin said its drug from fish oil has good results for cardiovascular disease in a study. One study group got the oil derivative which sells for $2400 per year, the placebo group got MINERAL OIL. What a scam! Why not motor oil? Clean fish oil costs me about $150 per year.
3580 2018-11-12 18:56:12 Translation: hey Saudi Arabia, we will ignore that mess with Khashoggi if you gave us enough oil to drop the price a couple of cents and brag about for the next election round
3581 2018-11-12 18:56:09 What did it for me was an interview with the price canyon oil field, saying they were in phase 1 with 90 wells. phase 2 and 3 would tap 200 new wells, but they were waiting on an exemption from the ag clean water act to do it. So they basically know they’re going to pollute.
3582 2018-11-12 18:56:09 La SEC no debería permitir este tipo de declaraciones en horarios de mercado operando. Y deberia revisar las grandes ordenes de vta en corto  del OIL actuando con la info privilegiada de lo que iba a declarar Trump
3583 2018-11-12 18:56:09 Gee, you mean to say that mowing over the rights of #NativeAmericans and endangering the environment to approve the #KeystoneXL pipeline didn't result in lower oil prices? Huh. Who knew that presidenting was so complicated?
3584 2018-11-12 18:56:03 A waste of what? Private company wanted to pay for it but was blocked! You have to pay to transition into a non carbon based economy.  Guess who has been paying for and subsidizing Canada’s economy for the last fifty years?  The oil industry in Alberta.

3587 2018-11-12 18:55:59 Those shale oil flare fires will be harvested, compressed as LNG and exported (not to mention the NG from dedicated gas fracking).  Some will go to Europe, a lot (via newly laid pipes) will go to Mexico and reshape that country into a top ten global economy.

3592 2018-11-12 18:55:47 What the f*** do you care? They have a monopoly on areas in many states. That's called breaking the law. No one entity is supposed to have a monopoly over services offered to Americans such as gas, electricity and oil and coal. You're not for us the people. Antitrust law!
3593 2018-11-12 18:55:44 To cut or not to cut #oil production, .... that is not the question. 

Is #WTIC heading to $21 in 12 months?
3594 2018-11-12 18:55:32 @realDonaldTrump, you know nothing of oil, coal, climate, economics, tariffs. You are ruining the US economy that it took Obama/Fed 8 years to stabilize. Our allies are laughing at us/you, and all you do is smile at Putin. #RESIGN!
3595 2018-11-12 18:55:26 The deal was we Produce more oil while US force countries stop supplied by Iran

But after 8 exception have been given to 8 countries the price of oil dropped 

And that make Saudis  not happy 
3596 2018-11-12 18:55:26 I read Saudi's Are selling off a significant percentage of oil stocks they know what's coming let's speed it up and not let them buy stocks.
3597 2018-11-12 18:55:21 What’s a good face oil ?
3598 2018-11-12 18:55:19 And they citizens keep electing the same snake oil sellers - that’s got to say something about their public education system
3599 2018-11-12 18:55:12 What on earth do you know about the oil market that knowledgeable market participants (commercial producers) do not? Do you realize that America is now a net oil exporter, and higher prices are arguably no longer a negative for American revenue?
3600 2018-11-12 18:55:12 Digestives lights don’t appear to have palm oil?
3601 2018-11-12 18:55:09 "hopefully"?

Their production cost isn't going to change if they get paid less for their oil. They will always try to keep the price in a range where total profit is highest.

Maybe you should put tariffs on oil too?
3602 2018-11-12 18:54:53 Why would big oil spend anything on green energy?

3605 2018-11-12 18:54:36 I Asked for factual numbers on Oil, not one sites findings!!  But thanks for that info, when I get a spare couple of hours I will read in depth, or maybe not!!
3606 2018-11-12 18:54:31 Snake oil is what we have been fed for the past 50 years.
3607 2018-11-12 18:54:24 Saudi Arabia waited @iransanctions to be effective on Nov 4th so KSA could pump more oil and make extra cash in detriment of Iran's fate. Iran is still selling oil due to the US waivers and lack of organization to enforce @iransanctions. KSA is too high maintenance.
3608 2018-11-12 18:54:18 One word.  Khashoggi.  This is your son in laws buddy!  You are using a human life to barter for oil.  Maybe trying to take us back to the 50s isn't such a great idea.

Perhaps you would like to take credit for the united states being the #1 oil producing country  

Maybe they & we are producing at full tilt - should be lower is frankly a stupid statement

3615 2018-11-12 18:54:03 I stand corrected @NutellaUSA. Appreciate that your company is partnering on sustainability.

Even if your company does actually use a small %age of big dollars earned to source palm oil responsibly, the whole charade is pointless to start with.
3616 2018-11-12 18:53:53 They fight afaist oil but they continue to use the products of oil

 Hypocrites

You know wind towers can't be built without oil

 It takes build ozers to clear roads and it construction sites semi trucks to transport the parts massive diesel cranes to lift them into position
3617 2018-11-12 18:53:47 Thanks CBD Oil - K Guzman for the follow! Looking forward to socialising your tweets :)
3618 2018-11-12 18:53:47 I thought the US was the largest oil producer now?
3619 2018-11-12 18:53:46 Agreed bud. Whatever the cause of anyone’s MI is, I suspect it’s down to the individual to find an answer the best they can. Doctors fire-fight most illnesses with opioids, which don’t cure; they suppress. I never take them myself. I’ve always maintained cannabis oil could help
3620 2018-11-12 18:53:44 Winter finches have been spotted in NW Minnesota White-winged Crossbills (near Plummer last week) and Pine Grosbeaks east of Thief River Falls today.  Look for them eating crab apples and black oil sunflower.
3621 2018-11-12 18:53:31 U have made an exception to Iranian oil to sold to some countries after promising u will lead it to zero export, So bear the results of ur decisions Mr. president
3622 2018-11-12 18:53:30 See me hanging with the Radium Girls because I'm too impatient to put a brush down so I stick its oil paint-y handle in my mouth.
3623 2018-11-12 18:53:25 Jimmy oil producing countries need high oil prices. In Nigeria we also want to have american style interstate roads , larger than life skyscrapers and world class hospitals like Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.  Where else do you expect us to get the money.
3624 2018-11-12 18:53:14 You can get it in capsules. I use BioLief for my products. All anyone can do is try for themselves. Everyone's body reacts differently to CBD Oil than someone else.
3625 2018-11-12 18:53:12 I have been avoiding commenting. This is an oil producing state that collects an additional 13% derivation allocation. May we never be mediocre forever. Amen.
3626 2018-11-12 18:53:12 Crude oil futures at $60 and $70 @ barrel. Continues to slide down. Coal worldwide markedly declining in use.
European and Asian use of green energy rapidly expanding. Oligarchs are losing their base funding.
3627 2018-11-12 18:53:12 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
3628 2018-11-12 18:53:10 Exactly don’t get it he need higher oil price for shale still pushing it down 
3629 2018-11-12 18:53:10 Well yes and no. The high PUFA and MUFA diets included margarines made from oil and they did not impair artery function.  So it seems the type of fat here is key. 
But it's easy to overeat on oils in my opinion and obesity would impair FMD.
3630 2018-11-12 18:53:10 Whats happened to USA being Oil self-sufficient? Why are we subject to their pricing/control? In Saudi, gas is 40cents a gal.
3631 2018-11-12 18:53:09 We should go full speed ahead making electric cars solar panels,wind turbines for houses. let Saudi's dry up blow away in the desert. stop sending parts for  desalinization plants. Let them drink there oil
3632 2018-11-12 18:53:08 Now officially " inclusive." 
It's a buzzword the left uses that actually means nothing at all.
3633 2018-11-12 18:53:05 Lmao once i got one of them saint ive's beads stuck under my eye and could feel it scraping my eye every time i blinked. It's gotta go.  over exfoliating makes the face overproduce oil . SPF must be used every single day!!!
3634 2018-11-12 18:53:00 I don’t think you understand how a cartel, like OPEC, operates. OPEC’s goal is higher prices, which they achieve by reducing supply. They can do this because they control about 44% of the worlds oil production. Simple solution for America, innovate so we don’t need oil.
3635 2018-11-12 18:52:53 I haven't tried that as I'm not keen on white, but I can see the big companies profits going down as more people try different brands Iceland do a very good dark and milk 'luxury range' all palm oil free
3636 2018-11-12 18:52:52 I've already written what's happening in the Middle East in these years.
My country run much of our energy needs via renewable sources. And we were self sufficient until this year due to renovations of oil fields. The current goals are fossil fuel free around 2040 if possible.
3637 2018-11-12 18:52:49 This is not what we agreed upon should prevent the export of Iranian oil to zero
3638 2018-11-12 18:52:45 Can’t you get your good buddy Putin to get you some cheap oil?
3639 2018-11-12 18:52:45 LOL...it's not about YOU! You can blame the fall on the Saudis for their limited oil production and a big sell-off in tech companies. If you feel harassed by the Dems, you must have something to hide.
3640 2018-11-12 18:52:42 To see the power of US shale industry, look at the US nighttime map 2000 vs 2018.  Look at the 2018 map and notice the new "lighted areas" in ND and Texas.   That's the shale regions with its flare fires.  NG is a byproduct of shale oil (FYI: which is light sweet crude).
3641 2018-11-12 18:52:38 Recommendations for a beard oil?
3642 2018-11-12 18:52:31 Neera, how do you think we can reduce the influence of the oil and coal industries on the DSCC, DCCC, and DNC?
3643 2018-11-12 18:52:31 Combats oil.
3644 2018-11-12 18:52:18 Production would tail off because a wells production lessens over time. Or sometimes flat out ceases. I know lots about oil production. Never got dirty, but worked on SW that monitors wells. So even in existing fields new wells are sunk to replace ones in a bad state.
3645 2018-11-12 18:52:06 If governments didnt kill for oil there would be no ISIS

Its all a domino effect, by going over there and killing their families because we suspect them of terrorism we become terrorists, we are the ones murdering and they react and come and kill us, its nonsensical!
3646 2018-11-12 18:52:04 Oh, your probably buying oil stocks. Everything that is going on in the market is because inflated prices because of manipulation for the benefit of rich people. (You and your friends) that's why you dont like Obama Care, because it messes you'lls Gains. Give back America again.
3647 2018-11-12 18:52:02 It's d duty of engineers out in vessel to look after it ..  not a single drop of oil or other leaks should not spill out  in the water . ODME is fitted to check it ..
3648 2018-11-12 18:52:01 Saudi Arabia had increased its oil production based on your promises to drive Iranian exports to zero, granting 8 waivers to buy Iranian oil was not the deal and dropped prices sharply. Saudi Arabia has no option but to cut production.
3649 2018-11-12 18:52:00 Let them kill another journalist for an oil discount...
3650 2018-11-12 18:51:53 Is you loyal? Too strong mix the gas with the oil.
3651 2018-11-12 18:51:51 Tar sand oil is not “cheap”.
3652 2018-11-12 18:51:50 The is good for the oil Something completely new to bring
3653 2018-11-12 18:51:42 Why is this oil change taking so long 
3654 2018-11-12 18:51:35 Shoot! I am 200 short. Need to step up my game in order to promote the BRAND NEW, FULL SPECTRUM CBD OIL TINCTURE FOR PETS (10% off).
3655 2018-11-12 18:51:34 I got force fed omega 3 oil 
3656 2018-11-12 18:51:32 The oil price is a function of both supply and demand. If production is cut, supply is cut and prices ought to rise.
3657 2018-11-12 18:51:31 My dad has made me get an oil change and the inspection done on my car by myself and i think i’m officially an adult in his eyes now
3658 2018-11-12 18:51:28 Cool to see local refineries starting to invest in a CCS plant next to the refinery, using the excess heat from oil refinery to power CCS plant. They're building test plant now going operational 2020, if it's successful for 6mo they'll go full scale by 2025. Est cost 1SEK/kg CO2
3659 2018-11-12 18:51:23 Are the Saudis taking a bone saw to oil production? (Too soon?)
3660 2018-11-12 18:51:19 Global oil is a 5000 billion a year business. 81b is not much subsidy. In contrast Germany pays triple the price to wind and solar.
3661 2018-11-12 18:51:18 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
3662 2018-11-12 18:51:14 You warm up that cooking oil a bit, add a bit of salt.. perfect seshebo 
3663 2018-11-12 18:51:09 In the north of world, famous for its crude oil and wind energy production
3664 2018-11-12 18:51:08 So you don't think the state of the stock market is down to the Dems (that was your theory of a couple of hours ago) but down to the price of oil. You can't hold a line of thought, for more than 5 minutes.  We should call you Goldfish-brain Trump.
3665 2018-11-12 18:51:05 They'll want to bring back whale oil next.
3666 2018-11-12 18:50:54 If they cut oil production that's there call and if US supply's get low it's are own flat we should have turned another way like electric car's and not depend oil to gasoline but I if they do there isn't anything anyone can do it's there country and not ours.
3667 2018-11-12 18:50:53 Never had a better frankincense then the one I buy from doTERRA. doTERRA is the only oil I trust to use topically as well as internally. I’ve been using their products for over a year and never have a I ever had a problem with any of it!  hands down the best in my opinion.
3668 2018-11-12 18:50:52 What is your plan to address the national energy needs when oil is depleted?
3669 2018-11-12 18:50:48 Just found out you can use coconut oil on tattoos so now I don't have to waste money on aquaphor. Hypeeee
3670 2018-11-12 18:50:46 Small hands, so how? RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3671 2018-11-12 18:50:42 Sure, they outlaw any 0-point energy, but the cost of oil. Ow no. It's gonna make you all crazy to keep paying for the death of our planet. I bet they'll accuse us of trying to kill the most beautiful world in the cosmos. I'm a little partial to this world. It's pretty, or was.
3672 2018-11-12 18:50:37 Leave Iran alone. Leave Russia alone. The USA is a War Monger country terrorizing the planets with bombs in order to steal oil. 

USA IS BAD
3673 2018-11-12 18:50:35 Protect themselves? We'll remember that next time you want to invade another country for oil ps the UK will send you a bill for turning up in 1918 when we started 4 years earlier 
3674 2018-11-12 18:50:29 Heating oil prices have jumped in the last 2 months. Gas is rising every day. 

More Trump lies!
3675 2018-11-12 18:50:28 All of it highly unnatural and non-traditionall beginning with expeller pressed canola oil through to "natural" flavour maltodextrin. Cullulose from Bamboo ?!? I'd say stay well clear of these fakes.
3676 2018-11-12 18:50:23 Are you saying we needed that Iranian oil after all?
3677 2018-11-12 18:50:12 The dangers of lead in gasoline were know well before they were banned, the impact of human caused climate change was known by oil companies back in the 70s. Is it unfair to blame those businesses who supressed the info to avoid the detrimental effects to their profits?
3678 2018-11-12 18:50:12 Nothing like some peanut oil & Chick-fil-A sauce splattered on my face when I hit a pothole 
3679 2018-11-12 18:50:02 Maybe we should up our investments in sustainable energy so we're not dependent on fossil fuels including foreign oil.
3680 2018-11-12 18:50:01 Tony just made me change my oil and my tires. Not going to lie I feel like A BOSS ASS BITCH
3681 2018-11-12 18:50:00 The Mexican Peso has dropped to session lows rising by 0.9% despite oil rising, which has undermined the seeming double top technical formation on Friday.
3682 2018-11-12 18:49:58 In the meantime OPEC and russia are talking about not to pay oil in dollars , but in gold of other valuta.... can you Imagine what this would mean for the value of the dollar
3683 2018-11-12 18:49:57 Nice thought.  Oil companies wouldn't like it though.  They like windfall profits.  Republicans even repealed the Windfall Profits tax. With our current Prez its not going to happen.
3684 2018-11-12 18:49:45 @nailogical How long after showering do you wait before applying nail oil?
3685 2018-11-12 18:49:33 I honestly don’t think that. He got hijacked by the world for years with trips & photo shoots with celebs. Mbeki was an aloof prick. The AIDS beetroot, garlic, oil disaster. Then Zuma? End of SA
3686 2018-11-12 18:49:24 Trumpy-Bear is tweeting about oil (oil prices go down), Comcast (Comcast stock price goes down) buy low-sell high right @realDonaldTrump when will your portfolio manager be buying Comcast & oil futures. #marketmanipulator
3687 2018-11-12 18:49:18 Bali showed some unity amongst the forces when they successfully ambushed lrc  terrorist on their way to bda thru Bali from Nguzang after trying a baby in hot oil. But unity still  needed at all level though
3688 2018-11-12 18:49:14 Get ready Gents, I'm about to tweet! Short #OIL 

Total manipulation of a free market.
3689 2018-11-12 18:49:13 Well they have cut the legs off Khashoggi, why not oil production?
3690 2018-11-12 18:49:13 I get ya buddy. I mean who has to get hacked to pieces for us get some oil around here? Such lousy service.

3695 2018-11-12 18:49:02 Now he is telling OPEC to lower oil prices
3696 2018-11-12 18:48:59 HSBC bank,  bankrolls the watchdog,hsbc has 
18 billion invested in palm oil.did you not know this canary.?
3697 2018-11-12 18:48:53 Saudi Arabia has people to feed Mr President. The market is flooded with oil and the increasing in production to replace Iran oil led to lower prices.
3698 2018-11-12 18:48:53 @MaltesersUK Dear Maltesers. Please stop using palm oil. I am giving it up on account of the horrendous things it does to the habitat of orangutans and I can’t face a life without you. Thanks very much.
3699 2018-11-12 18:48:50 Saudi Arabia Cutting Up American Journalist: ok.

Saudi Arabia Cutting Oil Production: BAD!!!  #TrashPresident must TWEET!
3700 2018-11-12 18:48:47 HSBC has been involved in almost everything that is bad in the world - drugs, arms, terrorists, fossil fuels, palm oil, fraud, banking....
3701 2018-11-12 18:48:35 Achebe illustrates the importance of proverbs in Igbo society by writing, "Among the Igbo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm oil with which words are eaten"—-
3702 2018-11-12 18:48:33 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
3703 2018-11-12 18:48:32 Lower gas prices from OPEC means what again for the American oil producer? I cannot hear you.
3704 2018-11-12 18:48:31 The company that pulled the #IcelandAdvert is bankrolled by HSBC. HSBC has an $18bn investment in palm oil
3705 2018-11-12 18:48:31 Or just use the oil that's here in the US....
3706 2018-11-12 18:48:25 I got an oil change last month and now I’m getting a new battery ALL BY MYSELF without my dad even telling me I AM AN INDEPENDENT QUEEN
3707 2018-11-12 18:48:22 Oil gap filled
3708 2018-11-12 18:48:20 That’s a really hard one. Sticking with the ant-inflammatory stuff is good. Hot baths with oil soap helps me a lot. I also use Kava for relief from joint & muscle pain & stiffness. Usually every morning. I put the tincture in lemonade, because it’s the worst-tasting shit ever.
3709 2018-11-12 18:48:20 It’s like oil from the northpoll trickel down to effect every humans life just saying what’s going on
3710 2018-11-12 18:48:18 That fragrance of rosewood when you clean the fretboard of your guitar with conditioner and lemon oil. And those olfactory-triggered memories.
3711 2018-11-12 18:48:16 Democrats winning the House is causing oil prices to go down. Cheaper gas prices at the pump!!!
3712 2018-11-12 18:48:13 Because... Maybe you are now an "expert" on all things oil?
Ahhh Ha haha
3713 2018-11-12 18:48:13 What type of nail oil do you use?
3714 2018-11-12 18:48:13 It’s literally taking everything in me not to lose my shit. EVERYTHING. Then you gone lie like I can’t tell wtf happened talking about “I just put coconut oil in it” bitch.

3716 2018-11-12 18:48:08 USA needs lower oil prices in order to slow China's economy. And Sauds should obey the rules of USA in the mid term.
3717 2018-11-12 18:48:06 Why are you still talking about oil?  Alternative energy sources are the future, not carbon-based fuels.
3718 2018-11-12 18:47:58 Many, many years of not doing it. 

Honestly, getting him out in 2020 will just be a start, as (speaking as a non-American), I 
a) am not sure you're going to get him out then & 
b) will believe y'all won't elect another snake oil demagogue when you haven't for a few generations.
3719 2018-11-12 18:47:55 Canada is the second highest weapons exporter to Saudi Arabia. They may not need oil, but they sure do sell a lot of weapons to them
3720 2018-11-12 18:47:42 Iran has oil.
3721 2018-11-12 18:47:35 If China is a major oil supplier, Trump's trade war would be less effective.

Trump kept Saudi Arabia intact upon Khashoggi. MBS would be open to the discussion about the oil price with Trump.
3722 2018-11-12 18:47:28 Meh. Chicago casserole, or pizza that if you wring it out would supply enough oil to drop crude prices $20/bbl. Not much of a choice.
3723 2018-11-12 18:47:27 Lots of oil in Texas no need to look elsewhere
3724 2018-11-12 18:47:24 Hold your horses. -Texas RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3725 2018-11-12 18:47:22 Who needs oil when you have coal?
3726 2018-11-12 18:47:19 I wish I could share some brows, lol use castor oil 
3727 2018-11-12 18:47:15 Trump knocks oil off course. Threatens Saudi Arabia. The US has leverage here but not with all producers. Also, in the be careful for what you ask dept, oil producers have way too much debt, which Trump probably doesn’t grasp.
3728 2018-11-12 18:47:11 Jesus, I am tired! Massage oil iko masseuse ndio hakuna :(
3729 2018-11-12 18:47:01 Because his insiders make loads of money on ups and downs of DOW/oil/gold/forex
3730 2018-11-12 18:46:59 They were after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 prior to that they observed like the Soviet Union a policy of neutrality. The Soviet Union was Germany’s biggest trading partner by Summer 1940 and 1 million tons of Soviet oil made the Blitzkrieg of Western Europe possible
3731 2018-11-12 18:46:59 Ah no. It’s ur buddies the Saudi’s threatening to reduce oil production.  Idiot. #LiarinChief
3732 2018-11-12 18:46:58 たまちゃ。。。

3735 2018-11-12 18:46:46 Dont fall for the snake oil folks this is the tactic confusion lies division all to distract from the fact they cheated the election got caught now its time  to muddy up the waters distract deflect  next pass blame so they can continue to  with the coruption & theft.
3736 2018-11-12 18:46:45 That debt bubble is causing the Bank of Canada some serious headaches right now.  Forget oil the next few years when analyzing it
3737 2018-11-12 18:46:37 Which is it? CBS just said that taking reg fish oil doesn’t help reduce heart attacks. They went on to say prescribed fish oils seem to help but not any OTC brands do & r a waste of money.
3738 2018-11-12 18:46:35 People who order their subs with oil and vinegar AND mustard and mayo have weird energy
3739 2018-11-12 18:46:35 What the hell does that that have to do with "OIL"?! Focus Dude, try staying on topic, I know you can do it, just try a "LITTLE" harder.
3740 2018-11-12 18:46:31 Something else. This same company tried this when the FDA approved their perscription for fish oil & they took over an existing OTC.
It sickens me the lengths a company will go to lie & scare people 4 money
3741 2018-11-12 18:46:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
3742 2018-11-12 18:46:26 Saudi Arabia’s economy is based on oil. They will cut supply, if it benefits them, not on what your stupid tweet says.
3743 2018-11-12 18:46:24 Why do we still rely on Middle East oil? Didn’t you promise we would be self supported by now?
3744 2018-11-12 18:46:22  RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!

3748 2018-11-12 18:46:12 Iran better selling oil
3749 2018-11-12 18:46:09 getting my oil changed and complaining about paying $37 while carrying a Valentino bag, boujee on a budget at its FINEST
3750 2018-11-12 18:46:08 America got so much free game on how to fuck over the Middle East for oil under the guise of liberating their little people from Britain in ww1
3751 2018-11-12 18:46:07 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
3752 2018-11-12 18:45:56 Dear Prophetic Woman..

You're not everyone's friend, your oil cost too much. Everyone can't pull from you. Honor being hidden.
3753 2018-11-12 18:45:55 Maybe that's why fox took meet w McConnell.  Then withdrew from twitter. 

And he's back with brevity via  tweet. 
Is this why there's radio silence from WH on Khashoggi?  Oil prices?
3754 2018-11-12 18:45:54 Oil prices are much too low. We need massive reduction of oil production if we want to protect our climate.
3755 2018-11-12 18:45:53 Does this idiot Trump not realize the shale oil boom in the USA  and the rapid depletion rate of these wells require high oil prices to maintain itself or is he trying to destroy another American (and Canadian ) industry ?
3756 2018-11-12 18:45:52 You realize Saudi is about to make their oil company public so they want prices to increase for stock purposes. Tweets like this is what make the market go negative
3757 2018-11-12 18:45:48 I understand. The law seeks to empower Akwa Ibom State Ministry of Labour, Productivity and Manpower Planning to ensure that companies operating in the State maintains a meaningful employment quota for the locals. As some Oil companies offshore are found wanting in this regard
3758 2018-11-12 18:45:34 GOP & shame, like oil & water.

3760 2018-11-12 18:45:28 @PeterGregoryObi 
I saw a report on Nigeria's gas wastage from flaring of crude oil.
Please is there a strategy in place to stop this and use the energy for electricity, which is one factor holding us down economically and industrially?
3761 2018-11-12 18:45:25 They have condemn it's attacks.... but US and UK has actual leverage over KSA namely with hey we will get our oil less where, and no more military equipment.
3762 2018-11-12 18:45:25 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
3763 2018-11-12 18:45:21 sudi arab and other oil producing countries should profuce omly thst much oil which world need on daily bases.they should preserve their wealth ..
3764 2018-11-12 18:45:20 US exports shale oil/shale gas.  Will disrupt Russian blackmail of Europe

If it wasn't for our navy, NO trade route is safe (you listening Asia)

Middle East has 50% of its calories coming from outside sources

OPEC can go pound sand

The era of Bretton Woods is over
3765 2018-11-12 18:45:17 But you claimed, in your recent press conference, that you controlled the global price of oil! Was that a lie? #VeteransDay18 #TrumpPressConference
3766 2018-11-12 18:45:06 You call them assholes, but I doubt your civic nationalist self has never read an entire chapter on gentiles' nationalisms that wasn't written by a jewish person
3767 2018-11-12 18:45:06 This looks like engine oil
3768 2018-11-12 18:45:05 عيسى رمضان : من المتوقع أن يكون الطقس غير مستقر من فجر يوم الاربعاء مع فرصة لأمطار متوسطة وغزيرة تكون رعدية أحيانا تستمر يوم الخميس وحتى صباح الجمعة مع رياح نشطة ورؤية منخفضة نرجو أخذ الحيطة والحذر.

3769 2018-11-12 18:45:05 Love the dermae very clear anti acne one. It has tea tree oil in it and it’s cleared up my skin a lot
3770 2018-11-12 18:44:59 why is mideast oil the same cost to U.S. as oil from home? Our oil companies don't have to pay shipping costs.
3771 2018-11-12 18:44:59 Mum stays for 3 days and uses more olive oil than I in as many months
3772 2018-11-12 18:44:59 Thankfully the Nazi’s didn’t have oil....ya know. Oh and that Trump wasn’t President then.  Cause....trump may not be Hitler but if he was president when Hitler was around....they would have been friends. Take that however you want. Hope everyone Has a good day  
3773 2018-11-12 18:44:56 The car needs some servicing but then there's this one guy who thought that those workshops will only change the engine oil when doing so.
3774 2018-11-12 18:44:55 Check the products you buy in supermarkets - particularly Own Brands - if it just says palm oil NOT sustainable palm oil then don’t buy. Not just food - shampoo etc also. We as animals need the forests.
3775 2018-11-12 18:44:55 I just paid over 3 bucks a gallon for home heating oil. First time in a long time that has been the case. Resign.
3776 2018-11-12 18:44:44 I know we are only ‘clever apes ‘ but I’m positive that once greed, religion , oil ,egos and hatred are removed we can move on as a species- ... yep - not a chance!!
3777 2018-11-12 18:44:42 those thongs or gstrings cause friction in between the bums. how about scrub nyana, then apply baby oil or coconut oil.such body parts can easily be forgotten. Just like guys (in between your thighs, its a serious dirt spot)
3778 2018-11-12 18:44:42 Okay this study has serious issues.
OTC fish oil no good
But perscription fish oil made by a certain company works great.
Come on
The pharm company did the study and shifted the data
3779 2018-11-12 18:44:35  leave oil lobbyists behind, you can't fight climate change if you're a SLAVE TO THE GRIND 
3780 2018-11-12 18:44:32 Oil piper line. To Weds. to weeds. #support troops over pride.
3781 2018-11-12 18:44:31 i've thought that $60 is fair value for crude oil when it was 100, when it was 40, when it was 70.... i maintain that $60 is a fair price and buyers and sellers will chop themselves to bits trying to outsmart fair value: $60
3782 2018-11-12 18:44:30 Funny. You er so interested in meddeling in world trade, and now you think you can control oil prices. Let loose man.
3783 2018-11-12 18:44:30 U.S. oil benchmark turns lower, eyes record 11 straight session declines
3784 2018-11-12 18:44:23 Senator Shehu Sani is not born to be timid, don't forget we need you back in 2019 at the Senate.
3785 2018-11-12 18:44:21 At least American pipelines are going to guarantee that we will NEVER be totally dependent on OPEC or Russian oil like the rest of the world. Thank God and Trump for making that possible.
3786 2018-11-12 18:44:21 Many so called renewable energy sources are a disaster for the environment and utility ratepayers, and are no where near able to meet baseload demand in the real world. We need nuclear, clean coal, and yes, more oil production. #MAGA2020
3787 2018-11-12 18:44:17 @realDonaldTrump Oil companies need $70 oil prices, jobs, jobs, jobs...
3788 2018-11-12 18:44:12 They need to be broken up, just like Standard Oil was the last time the robber barons threatened democracy. 

Everything old is new again.

3789 2018-11-12 18:44:09 I don't know where you see Blue. It's either Red or Black. Dirty Oil Black.
3790 2018-11-12 18:44:06 Because we have to. Not because we want to. (Right?) BE SAFE. I feel like there is more traffic (oil trucks/tankers in our case) and it's getting scarier.  Add the snow/ice/wind & it's white knuckle driving a lot of the time. 
3791 2018-11-12 18:44:02 Thanks Christopher.  I've known for some time that all oil impair FMD to a degree as well.  Figured there had to be a study on SFA.
3792 2018-11-12 18:43:59 @StartPageSearch they want your data ... not because knowledge is power , because data is new oil , it helps users enslaved voluntarily
3793 2018-11-12 18:43:55 So I made eggs this morning that weren't dry and chewy. Looks like using sour cream instead of olive oil or milk works really well
3794 2018-11-12 18:43:55 Shut up Donnie. You're out of your element! RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3795 2018-11-12 18:43:54 if in fact in a free market capitalism conditions that the price of oil should be lower, then shouldn't all oil producers produce more?
3796 2018-11-12 18:43:52 Oil prices dropped 20% during the past month. After increased gas prices of more than 50% since your inauguration, did we see a drop in gas prices to coincide with lower oil prices?

No. 

Did we see Premium drop all the way to $2/gal during Obama?

Yes.

You failed.
3797 2018-11-12 18:43:50 You mean the oil we use to cook with??
3798 2018-11-12 18:43:47 I'm sure 1985 is very happy to hear that. OPEC hasn't been all that important to oil prices since then.
3799 2018-11-12 18:43:35 Like Lord Voldemort, chavistas placed all their faith in objects, in material legacies, most of which were never theirs to use. #Venezuela's oil, gold and money are like chavista #Horcruxes filled with scraps of Chávez's maimed soul. #HarryPotter
3800 2018-11-12 18:43:34 Lower oil prices from Saudis opening the tap. Trump takes credit and says how supportive MBS is of U.S. interests Or money covers all sins
3801 2018-11-12 18:43:33 Oil rally fades further as Trump weighs in on Saudis
3802 2018-11-12 18:43:29 Does Trump not understand stopping Iran from exporting oil raises the price of oil?
Tillerson was right about Lying Donald!
3803 2018-11-12 18:43:27 Hopefully, Trump takes his nose out of the oil market.
It isn't part of his mandate.
3804 2018-11-12 18:43:26 Looks like a big penis, right?

Am I right or am I right or am I right?
3805 2018-11-12 18:43:24 So let us do something, and set a deadline for the removal of all palm oil in products sold in the UK. 2020? Our monkey friends cannot wait, and we cannot bring them back once they are gone.
3806 2018-11-12 18:43:24 It's soft too ahh Olive Oil and Castor oil 
3807 2018-11-12 18:43:22 Many factors in play when predicting future demand growth. Predi to s usually end up wrong.  1.5 MBD growth puts us over 100 MBD, that is a lot of oil

3809 2018-11-12 18:43:06 Yes, I’m sure they will want to flood the market with cheap oil so they can reduce their profits...moron.
3810 2018-11-12 18:42:57 The cutting of oil production seems to have taken a back seat in Saudi Arabia to focus on other forms of cutting.
3811 2018-11-12 18:42:53 @atiku I saw a report on Nigeria's gas wastage from flaring of crude oil.
Please is there a strategy in place to stop this and use the energy for electricity, which is one factor holding us down economically and industrially?
3812 2018-11-12 18:42:49 So, oil is more important than condemning the murdering and dismembering of journalists? Ok. Got it.
3813 2018-11-12 18:42:47 .@realDonaldTrump Debacle in Europe. Disrespecting the Vets. Rain. Record wildfire death/destruction in lame CA. Bad traffic. Lost AZ Senate seat to a sad communist. Time to distract - I hate Oil Prices! Yes, this one will stick with My Poorly Educated.
3814 2018-11-12 18:42:44 Reduced demand would also exert downward pressure on oil prices. Traitor.
3815 2018-11-12 18:42:36 Oil prices tumble because USA have selfishly upped production all year and added to a market that is over supplying whilst demand is dropping. Its not rocket science. #OPEC will not be pushed into a reaction. Again its not rocket science. Gas is now rising because of. End of
3816 2018-11-12 18:42:28 If Iran continues to export oil it is natural that Saudi Arabia reduce production to maintain acceptable prices for the product and importer
3817 2018-11-12 18:42:22 RT @realDonaldTrump

 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3818 2018-11-12 18:42:21 they already started, just before they had power. They were all about pulling out on Oil until they got some donations.
3819 2018-11-12 18:42:09 how do you feel when people tweet you their diy nail oil?
3820 2018-11-12 18:42:07 Hopefully Saudi will be cutting oil production very very soon
3821 2018-11-12 18:42:05 Jesus @realDonaldTrump... MORE stupid Tweets on #oil and Saudi's not cutting production to keep prices STABLE. OK $75 was a little too high BUT below $60wti is a death nell for U.S. producers. CALL @HaroldHamm ask him. AND this is NOT #MIGA - Male #Iran Great Again!

@TradersCom
3822 2018-11-12 18:41:58 for iraq/afghanistan, the environmental threats are dryness, sand erosion/contamination, and collateral pollution like oil fires (in vietnam it was defoliants etc). color will be another huge change; vietnam was all drab green and blue, all the time. the desert is golden brown
3823 2018-11-12 18:41:56 Ironically am watching dead BC and they are celebrating cooking oil and other basic commodities on supermarket shelves. Unfortunately they conveniently skipped the question of the prices.

3826 2018-11-12 18:41:49 Mr president if you're concerned about going American why don't we stop depending on the Saudis for oil and get oil here in the USA.
3827 2018-11-12 18:41:48 Getting my oil change and they are playing Christmas music 
3828 2018-11-12 18:41:45 @realDonaldTrump now that OPEC is cutting production if oil prices will go up.  That will kill the US Economy with high gas prices.  You will be blamed for the bad economy.
3829 2018-11-12 18:41:45 ill suck jinyoungs oil out his pores
3830 2018-11-12 18:41:45 @IcelandFoods it is amazing that you are not using palm oil in your foods. Do you also apply this to all the food sold, including those of other manufacturers?
3831 2018-11-12 18:41:42 Eh it depends on the year and some people don’t like to go 10k miles without an oil change. My car says 15k but it’s also a 2000 and should only go 5-7k now. Some people are just weird about their car and you gotta let them assume they’re right even when they’re not 
3832 2018-11-12 18:41:36 castor oil
3833 2018-11-12 18:41:31 Saudi Arabia has not always acted honestly. I still would like to know more about their role in 911. Why would we trust them concerning Oil Prices? They should be constantly monitored.
3834 2018-11-12 18:41:31 You were against the Fed of raising rate. Oil is just like the Fed policy for Saudi Arabia. The decision of both is based on fundamentals.
3835 2018-11-12 18:41:22 Also very glad you spoke up about Argan oil. Talking about important things like how fuckn expensive it is
3836 2018-11-12 18:41:14 Esp now that oil prices are plummeting
3837 2018-11-12 18:41:13 They didn’t have any problem cutting heads or journalists, why would they mind about cutting oil?
3838 2018-11-12 18:40:56 War, Recession, Blackwater, taking oil/war billions for themselves = why we should NOT be honoring any Bush @GeorgeHWBush or W. And why #Dems can't have @JoeBiden on 2020 ticket - happily honoring Bushes, shows he's prisoner of "for the camera old-fashioned politicking." Enough.
3839 2018-11-12 18:40:55 Trump has nothing to do with our energy problems Chuck .The entire Canadian oil shit show is the fault of the climate fraud cultists and leftist anti prosperity cranks in our Liberal govt. You know its true.#cndpoli
3840 2018-11-12 18:40:54 Needs to be lower! Way to high. Release the oil.
3841 2018-11-12 18:40:54 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
3842 2018-11-12 18:40:54 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3843 2018-11-12 18:40:52 Yes, with any luck the price of oil will drop enough again so that the fields in North Dakota will have to shut down again!
3844 2018-11-12 18:40:44 If they have the oil and you don't, they dictate the price. that's how it works.
3845 2018-11-12 18:40:40 Illegal oil bunkering and refining of stole crude has been shut down in and around the major operation hubs in Port Harcourt. 

Please be safe. When this easy money stops, other nefarious crimes such as kidnapping and armed robbery would 'naturally' recommence.
3846 2018-11-12 18:40:40 Qui peut aussi être du aux particules de gas oil  tu es inodible ciotti !
3847 2018-11-12 18:40:39 So what, Asian + European students who fill those spots in a month will replace the same investment.  The sky has not fallen.  Canada does NOT need Saudi Arabia for anything.  We're a net exporter of oil.  They however, have lost our allies support since the Khashoggi murder.
3848 2018-11-12 18:40:38 I have a friend out in Indo at the moment and the photos she is sending back are heartbreaking so I’d rather not support the palm oil industry - sustainable or not x
3849 2018-11-12 18:40:34 I  coconut oil.
3850 2018-11-12 18:40:32 Trying to change the topic? You are just as ignorant when it comes to energy supplies and oil! You cut back on solar energy development. You cut back on demands for more efficient gasoline motors and fuel saving. OPEC leaders know how stupid you are. Fool.
3851 2018-11-12 18:40:31 @ddyedlin please write an article about the National Crisis Canada is facing with our discounted prices for our energy (oil). It’s the seed capital for our children’s future... and he means to pay for our baby boomers health care, yet it seems overlooked beyond Alberta’s borders
3852 2018-11-12 18:40:19 WTF IS THIS LIVE ACTION POKEMON SHIT AND WHY DO I FEEL LIKE NETFLIX HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT????
3853 2018-11-12 18:40:15 Buddy the deal was already done. Which one was important, barrels of oil or the Khashoggi  cereal?

3861 2018-11-12 18:39:41 The 20 dollar oil change on the 30 mile GM is great but who really wants to wait an hour or more for a oil change
3862 2018-11-12 18:39:39 How is that America first? Shouldn’t we be using our own oil instead of buying from other countries? Oh wait, except from the countries that make you a lot of money!
3863 2018-11-12 18:39:36 De ce que je sais de ce projet, le concept est révolutionnaire. Mais je n'ai aucune idée de la taille, ni des prix sur le marché des cibles (dessalement, oil ...)

3864 2018-11-12 18:39:32 Bullshit.
Oil prices have recovered globally except in Canada because of a lake of pipelines to tide water.
Thank to Trudeau,  Butts & foreign money.
Calgsrians are rightfully mad at the right people.
Wake up.
3865 2018-11-12 18:39:28 Get rid of oil, switch to solar energy, take @elonmusk for cooperation. There is no better to be independant.
3866 2018-11-12 18:39:25 So what you’re saying is you need some super scented oil infused miracle hand cream that’s also a cooking grease that will clean your grout and help the kids with the homework? WELL HAVE I GOT A PRODUCT FOR YOU!
3867 2018-11-12 18:39:24 Um, too late.  Saudi Arabia is reducing oil supply by 500,000 barrels per day in December, and OPEC may cut too. But you'd know that if you were performing your duties and paying attention to daily briefings instead of playing on Twitter on rainy days.
3868 2018-11-12 18:39:21 Kinda passive for him as of recent, it's like he cares more about stopping the counting of provisional ballots, but not actually getting on the bad side of the Saudis in charge of Middle Eastern oil and who also bankroll the construction of his buildings
3869 2018-11-12 18:39:04 The day ended well:
Got a phone call from Spar that I am this week's lucky winner of N$1000 shopping voucher!
Buy 5 Spar products and get a chance to win.  I had bought 5 bottles of olive oil to infuse with fresh olive leaves to sell for our Camelthorn Adult Activity Centre!
3870 2018-11-12 18:39:03 Why maple syrup oil?
3871 2018-11-12 18:38:56 I think that's a great news, the arabs are filling their pockets nd it's not good for the world the oil prices have to be below 60 dollars a barrel.
3872 2018-11-12 18:38:55 Then why did you grant waivers to Iranian oil if there's plenty.
3873 2018-11-12 18:38:55 Meanwhile I’m here changing oil and fixing flats without even being asked 
3874 2018-11-12 18:38:52 Oil future should be banned.
3875 2018-11-12 18:38:48 Amen but if you're gonna do that cut the head of the oil snake and run 100% ethanol fuel or hemp fuel make it more easier and implement it for billions of jobs for farmers and big pharma and just for USA while exporting and going green
3876 2018-11-12 18:38:48 oil is not free its already cheap. How about cutting Ethanol regulations? That would make the gaz price lower and help word hunger.
3877 2018-11-12 18:38:45 you screwed up oil supply witj Iran
3878 2018-11-12 18:38:40 Alberta’s problem is the discount they sell at. We need a pipeline to get the oil to the sea instead of to America, but on the whole it would suit me just fine if oil prices go down

Heid News 
3880 2018-11-12 18:38:33 OPEC said today they would be reducing production by 500,000 barrels a day. Watch REAL NEWS instead of Fox-N-Nuts. "Saudi Arabia is reducing oil supply and OPEC may cut too"
3881 2018-11-12 18:38:32 After seeing this i remembered Regarding AI era "Data is the new oil. And China is the new Saudi Arabia." Kai Fu Lee, former president of Google China.

I'll be the cooking oil
3883 2018-11-12 18:38:17 Call someone a nazi over and over and over again, eventually they feel disenfranchised to the point that they start perpetuating the stereotype. (A gf accuses her bf of cheating over and over till he says, "Fuck it, you're saying I'm doing it anyway, might as well go ahead.")
3884 2018-11-12 18:38:15 Both can be done. But not if you’re in the pocket of Big Oil.

3890 2018-11-12 18:38:00 I wonder if the oil was sold for dollars?  
3891 2018-11-12 18:38:00 Or his idling tour busses at anti oil concerts?
3892 2018-11-12 18:37:58 Also.  There is less incentive for rare earth mineral energy sources when oil prices are low.
3893 2018-11-12 18:37:53 Is the Malaysian Government actively threatening to pull out of the Typhoon deal over this palm oil ban? Is British consumption of Malaysian palm oil worth that much? Surely it would leave them with a capability gap?
3894 2018-11-12 18:37:51 I wouldn't use Saudi Arabia's oil, I hear there's blood in it.

3897 2018-11-12 18:37:42 Trump probably doesn't know, but cutting output would be the right thing to do in an oversupplied oil market.

3904 2018-11-12 18:37:09 Take the lead POTUS, put the hurts to them, we have enough oil, put our people to work
3905 2018-11-12 18:37:07 Trump is a MORON.  It's not a supply versus demand problem.  Oil trades are settled (paid for) in dollars and the dollar has been rising which make oil more expensive.

3908 2018-11-12 18:36:57 Yeah, with oil rigs on every inch of coastline and no national parks and no trees because he cut them all down. No thanks.

3910 2018-11-12 18:36:48 You know SA is part of OPEC. Again you repeat your garbage to frighten people. Put more tarifs on imported oil.

3912 2018-11-12 18:36:46 cutting the oil production despite high production cost per barrel.
3913 2018-11-12 18:36:44 And please tell me as you seem to be the font of all knowledge on all things Scotland, how much oil is contained in the waters around Scotland?? An actual factual amount, not what a poll said

3916 2018-11-12 18:36:26 I need a oil change my car went from getting an average of 27 mpg to 20 mpg 
3917 2018-11-12 18:36:23 So the tactical question here is how does Trump benefit from lower oil prices?
3918 2018-11-12 18:36:21 You have the nerve to post this when YOU caused this cut in oil production by headbutting with Iran.  You KNEW Saudi Arabia and OPEC were NOT going to keep production artificially high just to save your butt on that boneheaded move for too long. #internationalfail #DumpTrump
3919 2018-11-12 18:36:17 You mean if price of oil will go up you will punish OPEC countries no ?
3920 2018-11-12 18:36:12 It's really, really hard for a living trunk to catch fire, especially at the speed with which a forest fire moves. Cars are also, ya know, full of oil and gasoline.
3921 2018-11-12 18:36:09 Or maybe it's because Saudi Arabia said over the weekend that it is going to cut oil production? Or maybe it's a slight correction?  Or maybe it's temporary? Why must everything be about YOU?
3922 2018-11-12 18:36:06 I've been trying to avoid palm oil for some time. Signed the petition too. What's worse is that there's no mention of the genocide that goes on in places where they're removing the rain forests to plant the trees. So many indigenous people lose their lives.
3923 2018-11-12 18:36:04 Do you need some oil from my face? I have plenty of supply too.

3925 2018-11-12 18:35:58 why are we still worried about opec? where do we get the majority of our oil?
3926 2018-11-12 18:35:53 I know this is just humor but google Tiger Oil memos if you want to see how close to reality this can really be.
3927 2018-11-12 18:35:44 For those saying the JMMC jawboning had no impact, think on this - AAPL  down, AMZN down, DJI down 450 pts...and you expected to see a positive  day in oil, based upon jawboning? The fact CL isn't at a 58 handle (yet)  is a win!
3928 2018-11-12 18:35:43 There is no economy if the energy price is high.  
Long term low energy prices means a more stable oil sector.

Reason: more economic activity happens when price is low. More economic activity means more energy consumption.

We want a long term society, not quarterly returns.
3929 2018-11-12 18:35:40 No, you should be providing FAR GREATER leadership in freeing our economy from oil dependency.  You are letting down our nation, our economy, our planet.
3930 2018-11-12 18:35:36 Fish oil supplements can harm the ecosystem by over fishing the small fish that supply the rest of the ocean food. Just eat more fish.

3933 2018-11-12 18:35:28 To make your shale oil profitable that is better for sure.
3934 2018-11-12 18:35:27 Keep olive oil away from it. It made me want to throw up and had to stop. 
3935 2018-11-12 18:35:19 As the trade war escalates, large oil producers are going to start ignoring OPEC restrictions on production, and ramp up their production to support their oil-based economies, causing significantly lower prices, as prices are no longer artificially inflated by OPEC restrictions.
3936 2018-11-12 18:35:15 Aku pake baby oil
3937 2018-11-12 18:35:14 Our problem in Alberta wasn't caused by Trump... for the consumer, lower priced oil is better.. Canada is where the solution to the differential price lies...
3938 2018-11-12 18:35:14 Exactly Sir, the oil prices should be much lower subject to supply of the oil. If there is an unconstrained supply of oil then the excess world demand of the oil can't be sustained in the wake of deregulated oil price globally. So we must hope Saudi Arabia And OPEC will not be..
3939 2018-11-12 18:35:13 This is why CA voted down rescinding the gas tax. Making oil more expensive discourages use thus less emissions. Don’t you have a Secretary that can explain this to you or do you want me to do it?
3940 2018-11-12 18:35:12 If you could do this one thing and make oil prices cheaper, then your presidency wasn’t a total loss
3941 2018-11-12 18:35:09 Huh that's their oil that they did nothing to make yet reap the rewards of destruction and world wide control.
3942 2018-11-12 18:34:59 Stop tweeting about oil.  Tweet about about your embarrassing trip to Paris and how Macron pulled your pants down and spanked you in front of the world.  Was your sore bum keeping you from respecting the soldiers in America?
3943 2018-11-12 18:34:57 Mommy, mommy, it’s not fair. He stole the vote. Please. Just your use of the word Cartel says it all. I support SM. And since JT is going after jobs in oil and Scheer supports them, I will support him too.  I’ve yet to see any proof that Scheer supports JT’s globalism.
3944 2018-11-12 18:34:55 Fuckin aye. Then they can drink that oil.
3945 2018-11-12 18:34:51 Oh no Donnie, we need a high oil price. And a steady high oil price.
3946 2018-11-12 18:34:45 Bro I believe Turkey could lead a UN oil for food program for Iran, and I respect that Turkey is providing needed help to over 5 million Syrian refugees
3947 2018-11-12 18:34:42 @realDonaldTrump Who knew you were an expert on cable companies and oil prices? What else is under your magic hat? @Lorarmcha
3948 2018-11-12 18:34:41 He does realize that he is also president of oil producers, right?
3949 2018-11-12 18:34:33 Brilliant episode! Love Hassan Minhaj. One nuance not revealed is oil and solar/wind energy aren’t in the same economic paradigm. Oil is mostly for transportation. Solar and Wind is for powering our homes and businesses. Important distinction on ways to reverse global warming.
3950 2018-11-12 18:34:32 Ok so low oil prices, zero fed funds, a wall and no rain in France, anything else ?
3951 2018-11-12 18:34:31 And now I’m getting my oil changed. There’s a man here making weird grunting noises.
3952 2018-11-12 18:34:29 Seems like there's plenty of oil to me (and free energy...) #teslawasright
3953 2018-11-12 18:34:27 The popularity of fish oil supplements is beginning to deplete the ocean fisheries. That's bad for everyone's health.
3954 2018-11-12 18:34:23 Saudi Arabia had increased its oil production based on your promises to drive Iranian exports to zero, granting 8 waivers to buy Iranian oil was not the deal and dropped prices sharply. Saudi Arabia has no option but to cut production.
3955 2018-11-12 18:34:21 Palm Oil itself isn’t the problem it’s unsustainable palm oil that is the issue and Wilmar International are the biggest culprits in the production of unsustainable palm oil. Major brands like Nestle and Pepsi use Wilmar produced palm oil.
3956 2018-11-12 18:34:19 Low oil prices hurt oil producing states , such as Texas and Louisiana.
3957 2018-11-12 18:34:18 Oil pulling is something everyone should try every morning!!!
3958 2018-11-12 18:34:17 Pretty sad tbh. She insulted the state and the people and is going to be elected senator.
3959 2018-11-12 18:34:15 lash extensions are kinda hard to maintain because you can’t use oils/ oil based products to take your eye make up off next time i’ll still to lash strips when i get my makeup done 
3960 2018-11-12 18:34:12 Thank you for focusing on the USA’s production. It puts Americans working and our economy becomes less dependent on foreign oil. You are making America great and greater again. Never back down!
3961 2018-11-12 18:34:11 Eventually, the masses will understand that the biggest mistake of all was the fact Pete and the front office panicked after season one of McDavid and it will haunt the Oilers organization for years. They accidentally stumbled into 2016-17 and it was great but not sustainable.
3962 2018-11-12 18:34:10 Hopefully , USA understands that Saudi Arabia cannot lower oil prices for free ! Nothing is free ! It must be a win win .
3963 2018-11-12 18:34:07 Please go educate urself about the history of that region. We destroyed their democracy in 1953 as the CIA executed Operation Ajax, removed a prime minister that was pro US but didn’t want Iran & its oil to get gipped by the US. Then we installed a dictator that tortured everyone
3964 2018-11-12 18:34:05 Same thing they are doing with crude oil right now. Cut the supply to raise the demand and raise the price.
3965 2018-11-12 18:34:05 I'm saying this now as I did when I heard Gavin Newsome is running for CA Governor: He's a Snake Oil Salesman.
3966 2018-11-12 18:33:59 You can’t have it both ways.  If you get low oil prices the energy independence you brag about so much will go away.
3967 2018-11-12 18:33:55 Hopefully,SaudiArabiaandOPECwillnotbecuttingoilproduction.Oilpricesshouldbemuchlowerbasedonsupply!

3968 2018-11-12 18:33:54 So does bad news about oil prices and the global impact of Trump Tariffs. Uncertainty is the worst thing. Market kryptonite.
3969 2018-11-12 18:33:53 If not that then something else. UK/Allies was so perplexed by thought of Germany getting oil from Iraq via the railroad they were constructing directly from oilfields right thru the Balkans to Germany that any excuse was going to do.
WW1 really is 1st exp. of a major Oil War
3970 2018-11-12 18:33:51 In the near future you'll find out their oil is running out ! So reduction makes sense ! Either way there's a plan and it will benefit USA POTUS TRUMP knows this !
3971 2018-11-12 18:33:47 Country has trillions in untapped minerals and oil. No wonder your masters did what they could to prevent their opposition to profit off of them. Regardless of how war torn the country would turn out. Afghanistan would have been economically much better without you soliders.
3972 2018-11-12 18:33:44 Dubai was notoriously known for pearl trading before the discovery of oil after about 30 years search.
3973 2018-11-12 18:33:43 mmmm. Asphalt.  I'd also go for Harbor Oil Slick.  So many childhood memories.
3974 2018-11-12 18:33:38 Just having his oil checked???
3975 2018-11-12 18:33:37 We don't need Saudis' oil; gas production's changed that
(you should talk to advisers! They're bursting with info.).
We need them not to murder US journalists
& we need YOU to stand up for lives of reporters under  protection
& stand up for key principle, FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
3976 2018-11-12 18:33:32 WE have NOOOO time to pollute and part of our presidents weird problem is that he is too mentally messed up to realize we can't pollute and polluters have long been a problem creating wars internationally to take oil/natural gas when NONE Of it should be used at all ever again.
3977 2018-11-12 18:33:31 I suggest that the US joins OPEC. You're a major producer and highly interested in managing the oil market.
3978 2018-11-12 18:33:28 Are we still importing oil from Saudie Arabia after they murdered @washingtonpost journalist?
3979 2018-11-12 18:33:28 Worries more about oil prices then his own citizens, what a president!!
3980 2018-11-12 18:33:26 I thought we no longer relied on foreign oil. Another lie.
3981 2018-11-12 18:33:22 The sooner we get away from oil, the better off we’ll be. Green energy doesn’t rely on any country or outdated petroleum products
3982 2018-11-12 18:33:15 "Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching." - you clearly have integrity, as do I and many more marketers. Shame about the loud mouthed snake oil salesmen who sell through BS, citing hunches and flimsy anecdotes as evidence!
3983 2018-11-12 18:33:14 Tomorrow in #ADIPEC2018 im speaking about empowering youth and gender diversity in the oil sector; two things that im so passionate about really and strive to enforce
3984 2018-11-12 18:33:14 Adriel dumb ass talking bout she did a hot oil treatment... i said how and you ain’t put a cap on steam cap or shit she like “ i heated the oil up” 
3985 2018-11-12 18:33:12 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
3986 2018-11-12 18:33:11 and what about #JamalKashoggi  now ? If they give money or Oil ,,,, your say nothing wrong happen otherwise ,,,,,,,,
3987 2018-11-12 18:33:05 @PHarry_Meghan please check Danny Markovitz for selling Tlingit tribal land, stealing my lottery check from Captain Cooks Casino, money from clearer cutting, drilling for oil, placer mining,and Edward Teck Sheridan lake property, bridge lake, lone bute 100 mile st, Prince Edward
3988 2018-11-12 18:33:04 But the other way arround would be ok? Kinda like I hear almost every day now
3989 2018-11-12 18:33:03 Mr. Oil Economist has spoken. Because oil pricing is so predictable.
3990 2018-11-12 18:33:02 When you pulled out of the Iran deal, they cut production leading to a lower supply of oil while the demand stayed the same. A decrease in supply with no decrease in demand leads to higher oil prices. They didn't teach supply and demand at Fordham or Wharton?
3991 2018-11-12 18:33:02 oil prices should be leveled with exact quantity, the lower we have, the cheaper it is. give society an exact number to live with
3992 2018-11-12 18:33:02 Aight fine but how much is it to get an oil change and the brakes done and new tires
3993 2018-11-12 18:32:56 Wait next week is Thanksgiving???? I'm going to Houston next Friday. I need an oil change and tires rotated
3994 2018-11-12 18:32:52 YOU BUILD HOTELS ON A GOOD DAY!!!! WTF YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT OIL????
3995 2018-11-12 18:32:52 Too bad your FAILED "presidency" has led to higher oil prices. I hope all your unAmerican supporters get completely screwed at the pump
3996 2018-11-12 18:32:52 After watching the iceland advert about the destruction of the rainforest because of palm oil just curious as what other companies are doing to cut down on products that use this ingredient
3997 2018-11-12 18:32:51 We want higher oil prices in order to generate interest in alternative fuel sources. #globalwarming

4003 2018-11-12 18:32:40 I'd gladly pay higher oil prices in exchange for not having the blood of millions of Yemenis on my hands every time I fill up my vehicle.

This palm oil is not only destroying the natural habitat of these monkeys but also destroying our health just so manufacturers can line their pockets.
4005 2018-11-12 18:32:36 We’re drilling more oil here in America than ever and exporting what don’t use at home! We don’t need any frickin oil from the Saudis ! 
4006 2018-11-12 18:32:34 u.k technically owns half that oil v brent before it was robbed. of course trade will still happen, either way...

Trump is OK w/ Saudis cutting up journalists.

4021 2018-11-12 18:32:12 You may have forgotten about the “Law od Supply and Demand”, but then you never pay much attention to any laws.

Also, I thought you had cured all our energy needs so we didn’t need foreign oil.  Maybe we can start building coal fired cars?

4032 2018-11-12 18:31:53 WHY??? Did your family short sell a lot of oil???
4033 2018-11-12 18:31:53 It’s no random. Oil prices are a political tool used to receive political favors. It can also be used to deter te United States other other countries from adopting policies that don’t favor them.
4034 2018-11-12 18:31:52 Oh and thank you for screwing over America’s oil production companies
4035 2018-11-12 18:31:51 I get to go do my all time favorite things in this beautiful snow: get my tires fixed and also make excruciatingly awkward small talk with the dude who will give my car an oil change.

4041 2018-11-12 18:31:42 There are dozens of studies associating mineral oil use with adverse health effects, e.g. cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, even when it has been used in cosmetics or in machinery work. It is incomprehensible that it was used as the placebo in REDUCE-IT. #AHA18
4042 2018-11-12 18:31:41 Read your history.  Operstin Ajax did overthrow the democratically elected gov of Iran, for oil. Done by the CIA.  They installed a brutal tyrant which led to backlash and the rise of the theocracy.

4051 2018-11-12 18:31:20 Saudi Arabia is strengthening its relations with Russia, oil prices and production will be determined by them from now and upward. Humm guess what’s went wrong with America - Saudi relations!

4054 2018-11-12 18:31:14 We will not cut oil production as long as all countries  cooperate and not isolate us over the death of Jamal  Khashoggi  which I have accepted that I was  full responsible

4069 2018-11-12 18:30:40 Worrying more about how many people they kill and cut up vs. how much they raise oil prices.  You should be worried about the former as well - where are the sanctions for Khashoggi???????

4071 2018-11-12 18:30:35 Why don’t you do something about it? Get us a deal! Give them lots of weapons so they can kill poor people and maybe they’ll cut us an oil deal.
4072 2018-11-12 18:30:33 I’m definitely not for OPEC controlling the price but we need to find a way to keep stability in the commodity price so thousands of Americans working in oil and gas don’t lose their jobs.

4086 2018-11-12 18:29:59 I dunno... If they cut their production, we could increase ours. As they drive the price of oil up, they make more and more of our wells profitable and worth running.

Th latter can slacken & lower oil price if Washington effort 2 slow down China's economy succeeds. Yet, if it doesn't succeed, oil will re-bounce & grow further

4148 2018-11-12 18:27:29 Hey Don - They'll do what they want to do, without any repercussions from you. What are you doing about the murder of a respected journalist? You said there would be consequences. Somehow, I doubt it. Oil isn't worth lives; contrary to what the Bush's and Cheney said.

4153 2018-11-12 18:27:24 They will just make balance to the oil markets & it would not affect the oil price much.
4154 2018-11-12 18:27:22 We are so glad you keep a pulse on this oil market, sir!
4155 2018-11-12 18:27:20 I’m all for cheaper energy prices but if WTI crude drops much more below $60.00 per bbl the thousands of oil and gas workers in Texas and other active areas will be negatively affected. I’m sorry Mr. President but if we want cheaper fuel prices we need to focus downstream.

4162 2018-11-12 18:27:05 The "snake oil" charge is just total projection & pot calling the kettle black. All the anon "scholars" in that article are themselves purveyors of grievances studies dogma. The dignitaries of the Emperor with No Clothes don't like it when someone points out His Majesty's gonads.
4163 2018-11-12 18:26:56 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia OPEC. Oil!
4164 2018-11-12 18:26:54 We don't need their oil. Just because the Saudis are wealthy does not mean they are worth respect. They just killed an American journalist! Tortured him and chopped up his body! Most of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia! Stop playing nice with the bad guys!
4165 2018-11-12 18:26:53 anything summer - thunderstorm rain smell, coconut tanning oil, hot chips, bbq ... 
4166 2018-11-12 18:26:50 I always heard stories of how we should not be buying products with palm oil but I just thought that was because it was bad for you!!! Now I know why!!!!
4167 2018-11-12 18:26:49 Yes oil prices should be alot lower, just another strain on the American people, to keep them working on the ground, instead of looking up at the sky to see the danger headed our way. Thanks Mr Trump for that.
4168 2018-11-12 18:26:49 Trump and his Putin worshipping cronies. Money is their God. Investing in trying to steal oil rights from the Arctic Ocean region. There will be a huge war there. Between the countries that are in possession. God help us if we don't restore our government.
4169 2018-11-12 18:26:45 You know if you’d support Canadian pipelines.. the oil you need wouldn’t have to come from the Middle East but could come from Alberta.. a Canadian province just above Montana. #YourNeighbour #SafeEthicalOil #EasyDecision
4170 2018-11-12 18:26:42 Just don't import their oil.  We have plenty of other sources.
4171 2018-11-12 18:26:42 I’ve been listening Elsa’s tiny instrument album a lot. Flower Man just reminds me of the old college station and listening to Flower man and Oil Can give advice on gardening even though I didn’t have a garden.
4172 2018-11-12 18:26:42 Let’s increase our oil production in America we have the supply and the workers to hell with OPEC
4173 2018-11-12 18:26:38 @realDonaldTrump why do we even buy oil from Saudi Arabia
4174 2018-11-12 18:26:35 I have very dry skin.. so me and this chilly weather don’t dance.. im here ashy asf using the whole bottle of lotion and coconut oil 
4175 2018-11-12 18:26:30 In the space of 10 minutes at the start of lunch I:
Had a rant at Year 9
Had a sweary rant about Year 9
Went off about palm oil
Did an epic put down (that may've been slightly aimed at my boss) about Sl*mm*ng W*rld.
Then I calmed down a bit but really have my sassy pants on 2day
4176 2018-11-12 18:26:28 You wouldn't it's pretty good. Just moisturize or use a face oil after
4177 2018-11-12 18:26:26 Oil on canvas,
4178 2018-11-12 18:26:24 Kudos to Iceland for making this video on devastating effects of palm oil consumption on the forests. Thanks @siggisdairy @siggihilmarsson for making products with few ingredients being environmental friendly
4179 2018-11-12 18:26:23 TRUMP SAYS 'HOPEFULLY, SAUDI ARABIA AND OPEC WILL NOT BE CUTTING OIL PRODUCTION. OIL PRICES SHOULD BE MUCH LOWER BASED ON SUPPLY - RTRS
4180 2018-11-12 18:26:23 Yes, low oil/gas prices are generally good, but an excess of oil supply usually means that slowing economic activity is causing less demand. Economics 101 - read up on it, Donny.
4181 2018-11-12 18:26:16 Er so that’s the point... reducing supply to support prices. It shows that you are supporting those companies that use oil as an input, disregarding oil companies.
4182 2018-11-12 18:26:15 They won’t be cutting oil production, but cutting humans up YES.

4186 2018-11-12 18:26:05 I’ll never forget Patrick Rouxel’s harrowing film GREEN. GREEN’s a female orangutan and victim of deforestation + resource exploitation. Her final days serve as the film’s foreground. With no narration, it presents the devastating impacts of land clearing for palm oil plantations
4187 2018-11-12 18:26:03 I was finna say Iont even change oil lmao jiffy lube for the low
4188 2018-11-12 18:26:01 Or we can start using green energy and not have to worry so much about the price of oil. #justsayin
4189 2018-11-12 18:26:00 Why don't we just increase production here and stop selling our domestic oil to China. Then we can tell OPEC to go fuck themselves.
4190 2018-11-12 18:25:59 Jeez - not only is Trump an expert on forestry management, he's also an oil trading analyst.
How does he get to know all this shit....?
4191 2018-11-12 18:25:56 SA just announced they are cutting oil production.

The desired effect happened its been banned do everyone is talking about it on social media.If on tv many would have taken no notice how many ff through adverts
4198 2018-11-12 18:25:49 Can President Trump please stop tweeting about commodities?  #Oil
4199 2018-11-12 18:25:47 Excellent. Well said. And backs up Chester Zoo’s stance on Palm Oil. Greenpeace are a great example of trying to do the right thing, but are so often misinformed by bad science. Hated them when I studied Conservation Biology.
4200 2018-11-12 18:25:46 Most people will turn a bling eye to this, just as they have done with western governments openly giving terrorists enough money to work hand in hand with them to secure everyone's #pension and expensive #oil. Most peoples kids won't be thanking their parents in the future though
4201 2018-11-12 18:25:43 Not really b/c if the club goes on another heater, many will jump back onto the pro-Pete side 
4202 2018-11-12 18:25:36 Y’all think oil will last forever....  It’s running out.
4203 2018-11-12 18:25:32 Coconut oil in my coffee as an alternative to creamer, no
adding it to a cup with @Ketogenic coffee creamer already in it...
YES plz, healthy fats all around.....
4204 2018-11-12 18:25:31 use olive oil + a little salt + pepper as dressing, it’ll change your salad life 
4205 2018-11-12 18:25:29 Why would Saudi Arabia and OPEC want to have lower oil prices?
4206 2018-11-12 18:25:24 Too low affects the oil field worker in the states.

4232 2018-11-12 18:24:53 If only there were some kind of, I dunno... alternative to oil that America could invest in so we wouldn't have to be held hostage to the people who funded al-Qaeda.

4241 2018-11-12 18:24:31 Hmm, it's almost as if the president has no control over oil prices and instead it's determined by global supply and demand. I wonder then, why you and other Republicans were so quick to blame President Obama for something you suggest is out of your control?
4242 2018-11-12 18:24:30 It's TRUE, artificially high oil prices do not reflect the actual supply of oil (which is quite abundant in reality)
With the additional development of technology regarding engine efficiency and extraction/refinement, oil should be much cheaper.
4243 2018-11-12 18:24:29 You and your banker's friend need higher oil price and of corse you'll get it
4244 2018-11-12 18:24:28 Oil and water don’t mix. 
Apparently the same for fat and water.
4245 2018-11-12 18:24:28 Olive oil was widely promoted as part of the Mediterranean Diet. I tend to use vegetable oils in lieu of solid fats anyways, as my incomplete recollection is the process of solidifying involves shortening(?) chain length of fat molecules? Changing how they react (?trans fats?).
4246 2018-11-12 18:24:25 He understands oil as much as he does the stock market and the economy.  0.0

4273 2018-11-12 18:23:50 Pls. convince them not to cut production. Gas is rising faster than incomes again in California. It is true California adds more in additional taxes to each gallon than anyone else, but the net results require the public to hope for Presidential leadership in lowering oil prices.

4308 2018-11-12 18:22:54 Absolutely couldn’t agree more!! It shows they are actually paying attention, which far too rare in dating these days. I told this guy I’m seeing I only use organic coconut oil for moisturizing. He had some the next time I came over for after the hot tub 
4309 2018-11-12 18:22:53 Maybe he can just be a guest host with Maria as we're now getting the play by play of oil?
4310 2018-11-12 18:22:51 YOU PUT THAT OIL PAINTING BEFORE YOUR CHILDREN AND THINK I'M NOT FUCKING ROLLING...LMFAO LOL SMACKKKKKKKKK
4311 2018-11-12 18:22:47 Your policies help raise the price of all things, not just oil.
4312 2018-11-12 18:22:47 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
4313 2018-11-12 18:22:47 Maybe if American oil companies were forced to sell American oil pulled from American public lands IN AMERICA, oil prices would be lower.
4314 2018-11-12 18:22:42 Wait. They should spend more money producing oil so they can sell it at a lower rate?

I mean, my wallet would be happy, but I doubt the Saudis will care.
4315 2018-11-12 18:22:41 Maybe tell the Saudis to stop fighting with other american allies? Have them involved in a war tends to change oil prices.

4344 2018-11-12 18:22:07 Let me tell you about the magic of an air fryer:

Good food and tastes good
No oil
No danger of being burned by oil because you're bad at frying

It literally fries air so its like eating nothing or popcorn so eat all you want, fatass
4345 2018-11-12 18:22:05 Cook for a chunk of oil over the defrosted veg, coriander (stalks and all), flour, milk and heat until smooth.

4351 2018-11-12 18:21:56 Rising oil prices mean bad President.
4352 2018-11-12 18:21:53 it’s completely possible they just use another veg oil. but palm oil derivatives can also be sneaky. i would mail & ask them.

What  Alastair Darling said in 2008  -  "Scotlands oil revenue has been underwriting the UKs failure to balance its books for decades"  -  will be equally true for decades to come.

4409 2018-11-12 18:20:01 It's hard to escape hearing about the "smoke point" of oils.

First, many oils with high smoke points display poor oxidative stability and break down quickly.

Second, the smoke point does not stay constant during heat exposure; as the oil deteriorates, the smoke point changes.

4423 2018-11-12 18:19:00 Looks like heating oil is over sold at these levels - I see a rally into the next 2-3 weeks - it may not be a bad idea to add some length to your positions now - my 2 cents

4449 2018-11-12 18:16:38 There may be a bit of knock-through from housing driven wage pressures. But, you'd expect those sectors would be able to pay with productivity if it wasn't for that.

4455 2018-11-12 18:16:09 Mais enfin ! Le 12 novembre 2018 le plus important c’est les 6 centimes de plus sur le gaz oil et les gilets jaunes ! Ça c’est important !!!!!
Pauvre France pauvres poilus pauvre sacrifiés .....
Ils deviennent lourds à tirer ces derniers de cordée qui ne font aucun effort !!
4456 2018-11-12 18:16:08 I'm happy to smuggle in Parmesan, top-quality pasta and olive oil for you if it comes to that.
4457 2018-11-12 18:16:07 .@lipiddoc @gina_lundberg Comment on this concern about choice of mineral oil as placebo in REDUCE-IT? Your insights would be appreciated. #AHA18
4458 2018-11-12 18:16:02 Luckily it’s not the light, it’s just a message that says “low oil level. Add oil.” Just afraid I’m burning it. Best case is sensor is busted.
4459 2018-11-12 18:16:01 Won't that upset Donald?  Oil prices will start to go up.  He will be whining even more than usual?
4460 2018-11-12 18:16:01 And no you put the garlic into the blender and fillmwoth oil until the garlic is just sub merged
4461 2018-11-12 18:16:00 Half a year ago, crude oil prices were expected to climb from $53 per barrel in 2017 to $65 per barrel by the year-end and to remain around that level through 2019.
4462 2018-11-12 18:15:56 We won't be doing any borrowing, we 'll focus on strengthening the gaps in oil and gas sector. e.g by building private/government refineries, we 'll cut waste of sending crude oil abroad and importation of petroleum. Then we can save over 43% from extraction of crude oil.
4463 2018-11-12 18:15:52 Not just tacky, it's disgusting that America elected a sleazy snake oil salesman instead of a president. P T Barnum was more honorable to his gullible "suckers" than Trumpet.

4465 2018-11-12 18:15:38 You must tell Trump who is taking money, doing personal businesses, buying their Oil, and selling weapons to Saudi to stop doing business with Saudis. Some of the so-called religious countries, and religious people are criminals. They are fakes.

4467 2018-11-12 18:15:28 I use tea tree oil to help with my acne scars
4468 2018-11-12 18:15:24 Looks kinda like those fish oil capsules idk, the color seems off tho
4469 2018-11-12 18:15:22 Olive oil
4470 2018-11-12 18:15:20 The barrel of meal shall no waste , neither shall the crude of oil run dry until the day the Lord sends rain upon the earth.
4471 2018-11-12 18:15:14 That's harder than you'd think.
I've noticed palm oil as an ingredient in things that it never had been before and has no business being in.
4472 2018-11-12 18:15:10 But those nationalities that took down the towers on 9/11, Saudi Arabians, Egyptians, Lebanese and those from the UAE WERE NOT on banned list, but Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen? Could it be OIL?
4473 2018-11-12 18:15:07 COSASE and its useless probes, I remember the Oil Bonus Saga. Wasted days watching that nonsense and nothing ever came out of that probe.
4474 2018-11-12 18:15:05 I would also say oil. Strawberries don't need anything 
4475 2018-11-12 18:14:59 I still use tea tree oil today, best thing honestly. But at least you found something that works for your skin.
4476 2018-11-12 18:14:51 This happened to me too. The next time I went and got an oil change the light came off. Might have to just wait it out
4477 2018-11-12 18:14:51 Aye. And if you can negotiate price before taking low or no interest rate financing it's a win.
4478 2018-11-12 18:14:50 how are people arguing against banning deforestation arguing that pine oil is a renewable source it may be renewable in the long term but  tress ain’t gunna fully grow in a second? If demand is growing way higher than the supply its the only option thats gunna save our trees:(
4479 2018-11-12 18:14:50 @business @markets @SheryAhnNews : Eventhough oil is in a bear market, it is still way above the recent lows in this cycle. It's still way above  levels that make it worthwhile for Shale producers to keep producing!!
4480 2018-11-12 18:14:45 "The nastiest and craziest things in the world cannot be pursued or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
4481 2018-11-12 18:14:40 Lol. Ok until now u had me interested. Now you’re losing me. 
How many more Russian operatives to we have to indict to believe we’ve been duped by the snake oil salesman named Trump & his back door manipulators? How many more substantiated dealings w/Russians about “adoption”?
4482 2018-11-12 18:14:36 I would get it looked at, low oil pressure light is one you never want to see.  Hopefully something simple.
4483 2018-11-12 18:14:31 Kane Morris has fallen 10 straight days in a row. @onehitgit explains what has investors bailing on oil…
4484 2018-11-12 18:14:24 Lol 
4485 2018-11-12 18:14:14 and @JustinTrudeau will do NOTHING!! Canada does NOT need Saudi Oil if he would approve pipelines!! All talk and NO walk!
4486 2018-11-12 18:14:13 Or in the real world,  Saudi Arabia cutting oil production in December, and a rising dollar are affecting the market.  Get over yourself snowflake.
4487 2018-11-12 18:13:52 Gas, car washes oil changes like why can’t this shit be free for females 
4488 2018-11-12 18:13:45 There is actually a monster in mh4 that is covered in oil lol
4489 2018-11-12 18:13:41 Much of the Middle East are already transitioning more towards other markets than oil only. Tourism and renewable energy being just some of them.
However, it will take a lot of years before the world gets off fossil fuels completely.
4490 2018-11-12 18:13:21 I have a feeling we will be dissatisfied as the entire @GOP are laundering Russian oil money to keep the @GoldmanSachs from defaulting.

Petrol dollar Nazi banking default 

KNOW WHAT YOURE UP AGAINST
4491 2018-11-12 18:13:10 How are you feeling? Can you share what oil you’ve been using?
4492 2018-11-12 18:13:07 I used it years ago at a doctors recommendation for the longest time and it just didn’t do anything for my skin. I went onto murad after that and it still didn’t do anything. I wasn’t able to clear my skin until highschool using tea tree oil.
4493 2018-11-12 18:13:04 No, #FearMongerInChief , your tariffs have been causing big Stock Market fluctuations, and the prospect of higher oil prices is causing further problems. The Stock Market has already lost any gains made since the beginning of the year. #LiarInChief
4494 2018-11-12 18:12:59 bio oil
4495 2018-11-12 18:12:44 Atleast u didnt do what i did and overfill it with oil #lesbiansandcarsdontmix

Akaramakallahu sir. 
Live long in good health and plenty wealth.
Ameen.
4497 2018-11-12 18:12:28 That's a great myth,you must understand what the Petrodollar is and it's function outside of paying for oil,USAZI needs their dollar spread throughout the world to pay for War,Military,Military bases,what known,then the Black Ops,to buy Drugs,Weapons Munitions,only in Dollars,
4498 2018-11-12 18:12:15 Also, the oil recovery is well on its way in Alberta too. We’re producing more oil than ever and some it is selling at more than $40 per barrel. But with the most expensive oil in the world to produce and global oil prices well below their peak, the industry had to trim the fat.
4499 2018-11-12 18:12:05 No problem! It was a great deal and I ordered myself 2 new oils! I'm excited to try them out. Twitter needs an essential oil emoji of some type, like a diffuser or roller bottle!
4500 2018-11-12 18:12:01 The economy is stagnant because of lack of structural institutional reform. GDP grew 1.3% in 2013 before sanctions and with oil at $100.
4501 2018-11-12 18:11:55 That tickled me when I read it...... he need some blessed oil on that 4head
4502 2018-11-12 18:11:54 i hope this argan oil will work for me please.. :(
4503 2018-11-12 18:11:52 is cbd oil haram
4504 2018-11-12 18:11:36 And lots of butter and olive oil. With carrots and beets.

4506 2018-11-12 18:11:30 If the government finds oil in my backyard it's government property but if it's weed it's mine that's good 
4507 2018-11-12 18:11:24 Trump: 'Presidential harassment' is hurting the stock market! Hard to trade with this situation. Buy Jan. O. J. at present 135-135.20 range. Waiting to buy Cotton. Crude oil is getting close to a buy. Use protective stops #Commodities #Agriculture #OJ #Stocks #Trump #Energy

No such crazy sheet called daylight savings to reduce dependence on Iranian or Libyan oil

Music dance and rhythm

Peace love and harmony
4510 2018-11-12 18:11:03 Since 2015 it is only blame, defense, loot, diverting attention from real issues. No forward, no plan, no direction, no execution of real projects after 3years. Like on a serious note where all the loots recovered, where the daily sales of oil that run in millions of dollars?
4511 2018-11-12 18:10:52 Stop selling guns to the Saudis? 
Stop buying Saudi oil?
Send war ships caring food to Yemen?
4512 2018-11-12 18:10:49 Actually, the oil is not a national resource. It's for individual, specifically from the ruling family. They pay tax to the country.
4513 2018-11-12 18:10:44 A lot of items at the end of the list are massively generic. How do we know if it’s come from palm oil when it can mean so many other things? I’m thinking Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, stearic acid, vegetable oil, vegetable fat. I try to avoid palm oil where poss but this makes it hard.
4514 2018-11-12 18:10:41 Where is the support for Alberta oil workers, they have needs and families as well . But Quebec still insists on buying Saudi oil.
4515 2018-11-12 18:10:35 Excellent assessment Nick
It’s  not Pavlum or Baby Food what is needed to appease the Crisis
The need is for unfiltered Cod Oil, Imodium & Kaopectate & then those small yellow pills used before a colonoscopy
Then...
A long deep colonoscopy to extract anything suspicious
4516 2018-11-12 18:10:28 Friend who use CSP, what brushes do you like to use to blend? I've been playing around with the water color brushes but idk how i feel about them -- any recs are appreciated. For reference I use the oil paint brush a lot in SAI

4519 2018-11-12 18:10:07 I don't buy it these days but occasionally I'll have a taste of someone elses, it is palm oil and sugar I couldn't eat much of that but I agree its much smaller yuk!
4520 2018-11-12 18:10:03 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
4521 2018-11-12 18:10:01 like everything in this country.. follow the money... it will lead back to big oil...
4522 2018-11-12 18:10:00 Crude Oil glutwatch is back after 11-days of declines (the longest on record) appear to have been stemmed on news of a weekend meeting between OPEC+ could carry production curbs into 2019
4523 2018-11-12 18:09:44 When I go get my oil changed and the guy is like just pop the hood and I’m like yeah idk how to do that but you’ll figure it out
4524 2018-11-12 18:09:30 She needs some serious exfoliation...and some oil..a wax...a bath
4525 2018-11-12 18:09:24 It really is. And palm oil is terrible for you. It's not something that should be in our food anyway
4526 2018-11-12 18:09:20 I think its having headaches because Macron called you out as a Nationalist and the prices of oil are up because of your withdrawal from the Iran deal....way to go little prez
4527 2018-11-12 18:09:16 To much oil and gas in “wrong” hands, that has to be “democratised” (read: stolen)

4529 2018-11-12 18:09:05 Just use red oil to save cost
4530 2018-11-12 18:09:04 If only there was a department with the power of, i don't know, make it harder to buy products that are made with palm oil
4531 2018-11-12 18:08:59 Baby oil on your ass and im bought
4532 2018-11-12 18:08:47 CAN has no love for KSA right now, so that could be the motivation. But, could also be a desire to whip up domestic animus towards ME oil, thus provide a reasoned argument for TMX, as a hedge to global ME oil reliance.
4533 2018-11-12 18:08:40 No more fish oil ehh?
4534 2018-11-12 18:08:29 Anyone have a lip balm/lip oil they would recommend??

4538 2018-11-12 18:08:16 Oil free diets are whack 
4539 2018-11-12 18:08:04 You mean the liberal pitch to turn Canada into Mexico. Oh wait their oil trades only dollars from WTI. Make it Venezuela..
4540 2018-11-12 18:08:03 Last oil short was worth waiting for. Saved my PnL today. Run time now. Hope you ledges had good days
4541 2018-11-12 18:07:49 Can someone recommend a good body oil
4542 2018-11-12 18:07:42 Indian politics globalised, so we think of "sab ke saath sab ka vikas" we are least bothered about development of India and helping OPEC by importing oil as wished by US though we have enough oil, gas and coal reserves but for some reason we declared moratorium for exploration!
4543 2018-11-12 18:07:41 All I smell is old diesel and oil
4544 2018-11-12 18:07:40 i really want komaeda to rub my silly little body with oil
4545 2018-11-12 18:07:35 What, pray tell, is sweet oil?
4546 2018-11-12 18:07:33 Oil is trying to fill the opening gap.

4548 2018-11-12 18:07:31 Hopefully the peppermint oil keeps away the spiders, even though it's a proven fact they hate Febreeze.
4549 2018-11-12 18:07:27 the cardinal rule of pimples is whatever you're doing, stop when it starts to hurt. That means that cell walls are being damaged which will lead to inflammation once the excess buildup of sebum and oil gets out into the general population of skin cells.
4550 2018-11-12 18:07:21 Too political?? Please! What is it about THE TRUTH that causes such statements? These fires are non discriminatory... they’ll burn right through climate deniers homes just as easily as anyone’s! Palm oil is unhealthy! Read your labels b:4 purchasing!
4551 2018-11-12 18:07:14 Fish oil works?  How is that taste?
4552 2018-11-12 18:07:12 You need to eat a clove! It may not completely heal you but it can help you get your voice back long enough for when you need it 

I don’t even know what oil tablets are

4557 2018-11-12 18:06:37 @RamsByTheHorns my aunt bought  a Mercedes C180,after 2 weeks,oil leak,took it back they had it fixed,after 2 weeks again leakage,she is not happy and want to exchange it or refund and the garage is giving her stories,what are her rights?the car is at dealer
4558 2018-11-12 18:06:36 Yes! I’m off at 2pm and just have to get an oil change! Just not too late because I work at 4am tomorrow
4559 2018-11-12 18:06:29 Fish oil isn't supposed to be that clear, that's watered downed junk. Info wars fish oil is top notch 
4560 2018-11-12 18:06:24 Obviously there is no overnight fix for climate change.   Hence it is so upsetting that trump is nixing legislation geared towards reversing the trend; hiring oil company cronies to head key departments.
4561 2018-11-12 18:06:24 I don't believe this is looking good for the bulls. $UWT $OIL $USO $DWT
4562 2018-11-12 18:06:22 Our failing Liberal govt is solely responsible for Canadian oil at $13 a barrel while the US and Opec get $60 to $70. We have been financially crushed by outside interests and foolish and anti-science "green" bullshit.

4563 2018-11-12 18:06:21 Granny just called telling me that she needs me to take her car to get an oil change and fluids checked. I told her no, she can go have her own oil changed and fluids checked. Toyota even gave her a free coupon for one.  And she said it so casually. Damn!
4564 2018-11-12 18:06:20 David Hogg?

Lol!
4565 2018-11-12 18:06:13 #PalmOilFreeChristmas  Say NO to #PalmOil.  Check ingredients on products you use, if they say Palm Oil, tell company to stop using it.  Check on Twitter or FB for the company and tell them you will not use their product till they do.  You are the VOICE.
4566 2018-11-12 18:06:09 Hey. No Stockholm Syndrome here, but nice try. 

Next time you decide to take me hostage, at least have the decency to get a hot oil treatment done. Your split ends gave me nightmares

4573 2018-11-12 18:05:16 I’m not going to explain why it’s a political issue, just Google Why is Palm Oil political and there is pages of it. Palm oil is the 4th highest reason for deforestation it’s not the sole blame as the advert suggests.
4574 2018-11-12 18:05:11 That may be, but we are not obligated to buy Saudi Oil if we don't want to either.
4575 2018-11-12 18:05:06 Coconut oil and tough love. All that’s needed!
4576 2018-11-12 18:04:58 No, you know nothing about profit taking, the price of oil or anything about economics.
4577 2018-11-12 18:04:57 Had to get my wipers for my moms car and they really gave me an oil change and brake fluid for free. People are super sweet
4578 2018-11-12 18:04:49 If you made a tincture or oil yourself it’s much less expensive that buying it through a company. DM me if you need help
4579 2018-11-12 18:04:45 Because the @wsj is a foreign owned publication. Wouldnt be surprised if tehre was some Russian rubles floated through along with Saudi oil $
4580 2018-11-12 18:04:44 They are still stocking products from other manufacturers who use Palm oil, it’s only their own products that are without it. Publicity stunt, it’s a start, but if they were serious, they’d ban all of it.

4583 2018-11-12 18:04:10 We need to be 100% electric in 10 years. Climate change is almost irreversible now.
Plus many oil rich nations (Russia, Saudi Arabia,Iraq,Iran) do not have our best interest at heart.

4594 2018-11-12 18:02:55 Pro tip: pre-steam rabe until it's crisp-tender (I use the microwave). Heat olive oil to shimering, add red pepper flakes (use Aleppo if you can find) & a big pinch of salt, then the rabe for a quick sear, then the garlic (so it doesn't burn). Add 1/4 cup chicken stock to finish
4595 2018-11-12 18:02:41 What a great idea. I love Po-Ho oil 
4596 2018-11-12 18:02:40 Oil prices rebounded after weeks of losses, as OPEC and its allies signaled a willingness to again cut production. (WSJ)
4597 2018-11-12 18:02:37 I vape, use gummies, use oil, I smoke the bud in blunts with an herbal blend. I honestly don’t know how much I use. I use it as needed. I make my own tincture as well. Maybe 15-30mg a day would be good to start off. 5-10 mg in the morning, 5-10mg mid day + 5-10mg around bed time
4598 2018-11-12 18:02:29 Sorry dont believe there is such a thing a sustainable PALM Oil. Forests are still cleared for its planting!!!
4599 2018-11-12 18:02:24 That's funny because not only did Trump's military kill Russians in Syria, but Trump made the USA the nr 1 oil producer in the world. And he told the W.Europeans to stop depending on Russian gas.

4601 2018-11-12 18:02:07 lol she look like she smell like motor oil
4602 2018-11-12 18:02:07 I want boiled yam, red oil and peppersoup 
4603 2018-11-12 18:02:05 What?? I like to cut them in thin slices, mix with olive oil and garlic, throw in some slices red onion and bake. Yummy
4604 2018-11-12 18:01:58 O/N Wrap:
Equities under pressure as tech and wildfires weighed upon sentiment; oil recovered by 1% after Saudi Arabia pledged to support prices (cut production); dollar-strength story continued, as did the #Brexit-leading-GBP-lower story; #NZD steady, but saw gains in crosses.
4605 2018-11-12 18:01:52 Try frying veggie sausage slices til crisp in olive oil with fennel seed and red pepper flakes. Makes them pretty good in the Italian Sausage genre.
4606 2018-11-12 18:01:40 Should is both are shown the door but it will be Todd who goes first. Said from the moment Talbot signed his last deal that he wouldn't get another & that was never going to change. Puljujarvi is at the point where he can't be moved b/c at best they'll get pennies on the dollar.
4607 2018-11-12 18:01:34 Now that #Hebron is pumping, where is Exxon shipping the oil?
4608 2018-11-12 18:01:07 Infused with CBD oil.. hence the name. Not actually weed 
4609 2018-11-12 18:00:46 The phrase "neutral in favor" of Franco is the most apt phrase bc the supply of oil was essential for the fascist military. And I agree that the Texaco sponsorship of Franco is unlike the Cuban sponsorship of Angola. In the latter case Cuba was opposing fascism, not backing it.
4610 2018-11-12 18:00:32 Can it also be attributed directly to the crude oil costs?

4619 2018-11-12 18:00:05 We should have control of our oil and gas and leave it in the ground if that's what we decide. We can be green and stop rUK extracting our oil and gas.

4620 2018-11-12 18:00:02 Cold salad is often tossed in oil though, but I am kinda on bens side.
4621 2018-11-12 17:59:59 Actually if oil companies started to think out of the box 20 years ago, oil would be a side business for them.
4622 2018-11-12 17:59:47 Violent Islamists do not represent all Muslims and corrupt industrial mililtary and oil machine does not represent the concept of democracy, I think we agree.
4623 2018-11-12 17:59:45 For good quality fragrance and oil perfumes, follow @lizfragrance1 very affordable too. #AbujaTwitterCommunity #AbujaTwitterRave
4624 2018-11-12 17:59:39 And hotter
4625 2018-11-12 17:59:32 I have a solution. Cut down every tree in the U.S. and that way they won't burn. Then you could explore all this newly cleared land for "CLEAN" coal and oil
That sound like plan?
4626 2018-11-12 17:59:32 if not for another 5-10 mins.

In a separate frying pan add 2 tbl spoon sunflower oil and once hot add 3 cloves of thinly sliced garlic and fry until coloured almost red. Then pour into the cooked lentils (stand back).
Serve

Good luck

4628 2018-11-12 17:59:24 Disruption in global oil trade is giving the tanker industry a much-needed boost. Daily freight rates for big crude carriers have soared four-fold to the highest levels in two years - WSJ
4629 2018-11-12 17:59:22 It is only in Africa that people buy anointing oil for protection from a pastor that has bodyguards.

And many of them will say they've never been duped in their life ...
4630 2018-11-12 17:59:18 All said though, ye Cannae beat a curry or an eggplant stew made with palm oil - palm wine is a bit potent as well
4631 2018-11-12 17:59:16 I’d take out the pore refining cleanser, choose a toner or cleanser that treats hyperpigmentation, add a hydrator & moisturizer, choose a different exfoliant 3x a week, keep the spf (maybe higher) and keep the rosehip oil. Add hydrating masks a few times a week
4632 2018-11-12 17:59:07 So wait, now you're dictating what a person should and shouldn't tweet?  Come on now. 

As dems we deserve to have representatives that are accountable and are true to our values. Is accepting money from big oil true to that value? Isn't it ok for us demand more from dems?
4633 2018-11-12 17:59:02 Youths,what steps have we taken so far to stop all this mess?
Let’s do less talk pls,we need to be on our feet  and do the needful before these leaders finish our dear land.Probably by 2030 crude oil will be useless and what are we gonna depend on in to build this nation
4634 2018-11-12 17:58:58 The problem is that most of the palm oil for these products isn't coming from sub-saharan Africa, where it is originally from, it's coming from Indonesia and Malaysia where it is not native
4635 2018-11-12 17:58:55 Why is it so expensive to get an oil change in Denver?!
4636 2018-11-12 17:58:53 Ohh pls body oil kharedne se bhi bachaya hai.. 
4637 2018-11-12 17:58:37 #tattoo #update:
It's been 15 days since tattoo completion and I mustered the courage to shave my leg. Last night, it was itching so badly that I thought I was going to scratch it off. My "organic" moisturizer wasn't moisturizing enough and I used coconut oil.
#sweet #relief
4638 2018-11-12 17:58:34 Was startin fair to middlin... Went to get some food, guy pulls up tells me, I'm leaking oil like a faucet turned on pull into the dealership and sure enough, oil filter cap is busted!! Now its hurry up and wait time! How does that even happen 
4639 2018-11-12 17:58:29 Coconut oil maybe?
4640 2018-11-12 17:58:28 It's quite soft, fibrous wood compared to, say, Sycamore or Beech, so if you haven't sealed the surface with cellulose thinners it will take an awful lot of oil and leave a dull finish. If you didn't seal it then wax, multiple coats, dry and buff between coats.
4641 2018-11-12 17:58:18 Coconut oil? Got it.
4642 2018-11-12 17:58:10 Actually oil companies bet that everyone will pay carbon taxed and they have cornered carbon exchanges and everything related.
4643 2018-11-12 17:57:57 So we wasn’t gone shave ? We wasn’t gone put some baby oil on ??
4644 2018-11-12 17:57:40 Funny, the stock analytics at my firm say it’s the wildfires, Apple and oil prices. Nothing at all about you.
4645 2018-11-12 17:57:30 Changing oil is art now? THE BAR IS ON THE FLOOR
4646 2018-11-12 17:57:10 The day I'm CFO of d biggest Oil & gas company
4647 2018-11-12 17:57:01 #SaudiArabia expressed the need for oil producers to cut 1 million barrels a day from October levels and announced fewer shipments from next month, as #OPEC and its allies began laying the groundwork to reduce oil supply in 2019, reversing an almost year-long expansion.
4648 2018-11-12 17:56:51 Wait a second, you left a few things out. Like his romp with the Russian hookers and caviar, baby oil and golden showers in his suite. They rolled around on American $100 bills while they were doing their f******. Oh and of course, Putin's approval. Big thumbs up! Shameful.
4649 2018-11-12 17:56:49 I count 6 or 8 and as many as 10 that arent doing it. Including 2 minority students. Just a guess but based on some of the facial expressions the photographer is the one that got them to do that and he/she is the one that needs to be dropped in hot oil.  Who was it?

4652 2018-11-12 17:56:41 So what should we do with ur impolite discourteous ass???
4653 2018-11-12 17:56:38 Thanks! I'm going to look for it today. And, I forgot to include that I used the Organic Olive Oil, Basil & Garlic sauce with it. Great combination!
4654 2018-11-12 17:56:23 I believe so.  It's a clear oil.  It's what I get when I order a Turkey sub and ask for oil.  Seems tasteless and simply enhances sandwich.
4655 2018-11-12 17:56:13 @_homogay just noticed our canola oil for the fryers is from canada and it made me think of u
4656 2018-11-12 17:56:11 Throwing some oil on a hot Elder Skillet to fry up some hash browns >>>>>>
4657 2018-11-12 17:56:07 With this scrub, I actually used a fragrance oil! So no actual Apple, but you may just want to check with your doctor to be sure it’d be alright for you!
4658 2018-11-12 17:56:02 I was so tired last night I put jamaican black castor oil on my face by mistake instead of vitamin E... let’s just hope I don’t grow a mustache.

4664 2018-11-12 17:55:29 Does marula oil go on after the DE glycolic Framboos or after I put on all my other face goos since it’s an oil

4666 2018-11-12 17:55:22 Cheap bread at $1.40, cooking oil at $8.00?
4667 2018-11-12 17:55:09 Ecobuds is selling all organic tea, coffee, chocolate, olive oil and hot cocoa! Money raised will not only benefit the club, but the third world continues from which the products came from. DM for more info!
4668 2018-11-12 17:54:58 Let’s really remember the sacrifice of the people who fought Nazis and stop sending more out to die for oil and conquest. 

Thank you.
4669 2018-11-12 17:54:48 I've always wondered if the cars in that world run on that electric grid since the dinosaurs never went extinct and there would be no oil. Or if they just thought it looked weird.
4670 2018-11-12 17:54:41 Pep tissue oil, the brown one.. Cleared all my pregnancy dark marks and patches
4671 2018-11-12 17:54:33 You're right about Saudi Arabia and more and more is coming to light. Once USA can be totally dependent on our own oil we won't need them anymore. If maybe when they run out of oil what will happen to the Middle East?
4672 2018-11-12 17:54:13 @WWLTV could speak to the matter of the Taylor oil spill in the Gulf?
4673 2018-11-12 17:54:10 Drink two bottles of anointing oil and fast for 1week o tan
4674 2018-11-12 17:54:08 Get ready to buy more Saudi oil!
4675 2018-11-12 17:54:00 We have set ourselves a target of using 100% RSPO certified palm oil by 2020 - Natalie
4676 2018-11-12 17:53:46 Kuma she go climb opebi link bridge with us
4677 2018-11-12 17:53:43 I think the problem is thinking that one thing vs the other as if they are mutually exclusive. If you get caught up in comparing Islam with Western Democracy (?!), you are falling into the devisive rhetoric propagated for oil wars.
4678 2018-11-12 17:53:40 Chump, after trying to eat a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs with Russian hookers on the side. Covered in baby oil and golden showers. That's the look on his face when he opened the door and Melania was there!
4679 2018-11-12 17:53:32 Using cooking oil as a body lotion.
4680 2018-11-12 17:53:26 My aunt putting castor oil in the my Danone 
4681 2018-11-12 17:53:26 We consider RSPO to be the most comprehensive and widely accepted sustainable palm oil certification system and therefore are committed to supporting and giving preference to palm oil and palm oil based products that are RSPO certified.
4682 2018-11-12 17:53:26 Verstappen: "I will probably be one of the last people in the world to try and buy the last barrels of oil.”
4683 2018-11-12 17:53:24 BTW - Like you, I took a hard pass on all those "Congrats on your Engineering Degree! Buy a new F-250 King Ranch Platinum 4WD! No money down, No payments for 6 months! letters.

The universities / depts should get their asses kicked for giving out grads' addresses.
4684 2018-11-12 17:53:22 I need some new blades for my wipers, I need an oil change, I need a million dollars MAN shit is rough outchea

4691 2018-11-12 17:52:49 @NaturesChoice1 Is the palm oil in your almond and coconut milk powders sustainably produced?
4692 2018-11-12 17:52:31 Still won't stop me from using products I enjoy, whether they have palm oil or not.
4693 2018-11-12 17:52:22 Elon Musk, Bitcoin, fake account - that's like triple snake oil
4694 2018-11-12 17:52:11 You lost at climate change. It doesn’t exist. And oil companies have to comply with state and federal regulations regarding emissions. The money this state makes off the oilfield is unbelievable. Take that money away and this state would be in big trouble.
4695 2018-11-12 17:52:07 They're in the shop for inspection and an oil change
4696 2018-11-12 17:52:03 Is mineral oil an omega 6?
4697 2018-11-12 17:52:02 Yay: cooked a good dinner
Nay: it had at least two pieces of plastic in it (from opening a new bottle of olive oil).
4698 2018-11-12 17:51:52 Oh man, I'm so sorry the surgery didn't work! I've been able to keep mine under control with lavender oil and a brace a night, but when it flares up there is no writing happening :/

4700 2018-11-12 17:51:46 Hey think that might be the Saudis cutting back on oil output, cause they are pissed the world wants to hold them accountable for killing people
4701 2018-11-12 17:51:44 I recently had some health issues that I was able to correct by taking as much oil out of my diet as I could reasonably manage for a guy who eats lunch out everyday. I also lost 35 pounds so, WIN!
4702 2018-11-12 17:51:44 It’s not ‘divisive politics’...it’s one party, the GOP, in thrall to big oil claiming they don’t believe in science
4703 2018-11-12 17:51:38 @jiffylube been a customer for awhile. But no Veterans oil changes in Texas? #bye
4704 2018-11-12 17:51:34 Could be oil pump not working properly.
4705 2018-11-12 17:51:33 Well the Tunnocks Teacake was invented in 1956. So long after palm oil arrived in the UK sometime in the 1800s. Don’t know if the teacake has always included palm oil though, or whether an alternative can be found.
4706 2018-11-12 17:51:23 Can i have ever played fortnite on the floor like a dozen projects i want to start selling snake oil cables and accessories for retro gamers the same thing as an alternative to meat or beans?
4707 2018-11-12 17:51:12 The twitter social media person for the Oilers is a twit. That post matched the performance on the ice last night
4708 2018-11-12 17:51:10 That's a great point. I definitely didn't look at it from a vegan perspective. I was just hoping that people begin to be conscious about their palm oil consumption. But you're right, it will draw out criticism.
4709 2018-11-12 17:50:59 i can’t believe we thrashed the habitats of wildlife just for oil palm plantation. note that they’re stinky, ugly and unlasting resources !!!!
4710 2018-11-12 17:50:58 Not even a little bit. Stir fry isn’t a dish but how you prepare something. I’ve never seen a salad prepared in a hot wok with olive oil
4711 2018-11-12 17:50:54 Next time try Patanjali oil as well
4712 2018-11-12 17:50:48 What...cannot put $DM down anymore..

It was just a metter of time

4714 2018-11-12 17:50:45 ............and with this meagerly priced bottle of Concentrated Trump Snake Oil, simply place a few drops strategically throughout the forest and - Voila
4715 2018-11-12 17:50:28 That’s funny because I just saw a story yesterday saying fish oil and vitamin D had no benefit in preventing any disease 
4716 2018-11-12 17:50:16 @FordServiceCA  Is there a customer service contact I can reach to discuss concerns with Fuel Dilution in Engine oil? 2018 f150 3.5 EcoBoost.  Local dealers wont do anything unless check engine light comes on.
4717 2018-11-12 17:50:15 Now who's pushin snake oil. Sad that you eat up that spoon fed garbage. Thought you were better than that. Future proves past. WE have nothing to convince (you) of. Where is your voice against the pedophilia and ritual abuse of the ruling class...? Wake up. WE have.
4718 2018-11-12 17:50:15 El oil subio?
4719 2018-11-12 17:50:02 Started of the day not being able to hear out of my left ear still with the cold, went to work got sent home 5 hours early and now I’ve got olive oil in my ear bc my mum said that’ll fix it..how’s your day going
4720 2018-11-12 17:49:53 $GS upgrades airlines to buy. So must be a great time to sell like when it issued  oil target of $200 when trading at $140 in 2008. Promptly collapsed to $35 by 2009 
4721 2018-11-12 17:49:51 Lol, I need my man to do those things & then we will be good. He pays my car note at times, but take It to get a oil changed, detail & fill up .
4722 2018-11-12 17:49:42 Every LEGAL vote.

Snake oil not all its cracked up 2B.
4723 2018-11-12 17:49:37 You know I really love my Honda, but fuck if waiting 4 hours for an oil change with an an appointment doesn’t piss me off. @dowhondacars
4724 2018-11-12 17:49:36 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
4725 2018-11-12 17:49:29 Surely, the real story here isn't that @IcelandFoods made an ad they knew was going to get banned and thus create social buzz, but that it got banned at all.  Why is spreading awareness of the source of palm oil deplorable?
4726 2018-11-12 17:49:28 @jimmy_dore @JREpodcast when is someone going to expose the “Campfire” forest fire in California was caused by a gas line explosion: like the ones in DAPL: and they dub it “Campfire”?!? Way to mislead the public and allow big oil off the hook.
4727 2018-11-12 17:49:27 When you get that oil change and fill tank of gas >
4728 2018-11-12 17:49:23 Never said it was okay with Benghazi that was a fiasco that should have never been started in the first place
We were forced into that mess by the EU to keep oil prices elevated

It's as daft as that
4738 2018-11-12 17:48:46 Dear @sainsburys. I shop with you online every week. What can you do to help me buy products with less non recyclable packaging and no palm oil?
4739 2018-11-12 17:48:44 Have you seen the English Iceland Christmas advert Lin? It’s about palm oil and it’s effects, it’s devastating.

4742 2018-11-12 17:47:39 Surely the oil is not infinite? How is it produced and how will we not run out?
4743 2018-11-12 17:47:37 its actually a different kind of olive oil that u use while baking! it's lighter than regular. ive made stuff with it before and i love it!! ESP chocolate stuff omg
4744 2018-11-12 17:47:31 What an idiot he is . Orangutans are declining, there are shampoos without palm oil
4745 2018-11-12 17:47:21 Note the empty eyes and the oil sheen on the skin. Looks about right.

4747 2018-11-12 17:47:20 We have a small-small problem of being in a hole and instead of building a ladder to climb out, we keep digging. That's how we struck oil and gold....
4748 2018-11-12 17:47:12 Laughable.  He’s cut their insurance benefits and has never visited any military installation outside of Seymour Johnson, which happened three years ago.  George Holding has visited oil companies, Indian legislators, and disgraced former MPs in Britain, no time for troops.

4754 2018-11-12 17:46:32 Palm oil has a greater yield than rape, so the rape market is getting squeezed. Its doing wonders for Malaysia, but buggering up the EU. So there is questions on potential trade barriers. Or questions about environmental issues.

4760 2018-11-12 17:46:01 Hope you guys improved the oil pan situation.  I have a 2017 that’s already been replaced twice.
4761 2018-11-12 17:45:51 i guess they dont have to be lemon but i thought oil was the primary flavor  so i thought it was some hoity toity food experience that sounded terrrible but was closet a banger
4762 2018-11-12 17:45:33 @realDonaldTrump had asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to counter to balance the oil production after imposing sanctions on Iran ! But Saudi arabia is doing exact opposite to it ! Meanwhile, @RT_Erdogan has also shared audio clips of #Khashoggi murder case! Waitnwatch

Oil will be obsolete not because we will use all of it but because it will be replaced by inexpensive clean electricity.
4770 2018-11-12 17:44:32 There is something wrong with modern Christians, Owner of Diamond plaza Chartul every Friday he feeds the poor, he give them 2 packs of maize flour, wheat flour, greengram and cooking oil as offering, show me one Kenyan billionaire Preachers who feed poor people in their area?
4771 2018-11-12 17:44:31 they dont need to be lemon. they can just be muffins baked with olive oil
4772 2018-11-12 17:44:30 Oil is getting ready to rip the face off of every bear who doesn’t know when to hibernate.
4773 2018-11-12 17:44:24 Nooo....  a glut in oil!
4774 2018-11-12 17:44:23 Funny that Westminster NEVER seems to get enough of oil - and that, without oil, Westminster policies over the last 40 odd years would have been drastically curtailed.

They STILL need it now, to survive Brexit.

4778 2018-11-12 17:44:12 Also, investigations found that Turkey was the country that was purchasing ISIS oil through their smuggling operations.
4779 2018-11-12 17:44:07 It’s not about being preached to, it’s about raising awareness. I would have had no idea palm oil was in shampoo. If this snowflake feels guilty, then that’s his issue.

4795 2018-11-12 17:42:27 Man, remember Peak Oil? There’s a part of me that’d love it if, after we spent all this time worrying about creeping fascism, Peak Oil just busted through a wall like the Kool Aid Man and was all “REMEMBER ME, MOTHERFUCKERS?!”
4796 2018-11-12 17:42:24 So you would prefer a war-monger POTUS that will install military bases all over the world, dominate world currency, and control oil?

Bhai, thoda soch lo. International Politics rehne do apni jagah pe. India pe concentrate karo.
4797 2018-11-12 17:42:19 I also have to acknowledge the all-of-the-above energy plan was a huge disappointment, the administration paved the way for fracking to escalate across the country & the world.  And while the new federal lands coal policy was good, it exempted oil and gas (and left old leases.)
4798 2018-11-12 17:42:00 It seems to be about crude oil prices; talk to your Saudi buddies.
4799 2018-11-12 17:41:56 Dems are using CC for political reasons. If you look at the history, CO2 has ranged from 280 ppm to 8,000 ppm. Thereve been many cool and warm periods including the Ice Age. This warm period is expected to last another 200-300 years. Dems just want to destroy the oil industry.

4812 2018-11-12 17:40:54 Once again, I know what black face is.  I also know that characters can be the color of black and just be that.  We have to be careful about blurring the two.  We can have a character made of black oil, charcoal, and other black mediums not be racist or anti,
4813 2018-11-12 17:40:53 It’s always been real. The only people denying it work in Oil or Coal.

4817 2018-11-12 17:40:44 Did u see Gorka's post, YET AGAIN, refuting Q? I'm no devotee, just see it as a useful source of information. But when I see people refuting it over & over spending so much time on "snake oil" it really makes me wonder. That's more likely to convince me of its veracity.
4818 2018-11-12 17:40:43 Q is garbage, with that being said here’s what you said:

Sebastian Gorka- “I resigned because anti-MAGA forces have taken over the WH.”

No Sebastian you were fired because you tried to sell Snake Oil to people that actually have a clue what’s going on with our Military.
4819 2018-11-12 17:40:42 @IcelandFoods would of stopped selling the Bourneville Orange as they contain palm oil.

4832 2018-11-12 17:39:15 Now do the US environmental groups who disrupted the last federal election and displaced up to 15 Tories in Western Canada. Discuss how they are masquerading as 'charities' and only attacking Canadian oil, impacting Canada's prosperity. Why does CBC look the other way?

4847 2018-11-12 17:37:26 From memory only: wasn't Burmail Oil not about British citizens and/or not on British soil? Also seem to recall something about not being statutory rights in any event, but cannot remember tbh!
4848 2018-11-12 17:37:20 Went on strike in Nottingham oil refinery over health and safety. English workers were locked out and laid off to be replaced by Italian workers who destroyed our union. You are the friend of the EU and their labour destroying rules. Stop calling yourself a socialist.

4850 2018-11-12 17:37:11 Good work Bill. And look how sentiment has changed over the years regarding deforestation. Look how we have changed our view on cars and the way they pump out pollution. Do you not think we will improve regarding palm oil?
4851 2018-11-12 17:36:58 The trigger already happened, oil prices got too high along with bond yields 
4852 2018-11-12 17:36:53 Why not have DJT disavow it then? And why do some seem so keen on refuting "snake oil" constantly? I'm no devotee, just think it's a useful source of information but when I see people protesting too much, I start to wonder if it IS actually more.
4853 2018-11-12 17:36:49 おめ〜
4854 2018-11-12 17:36:47 .@EU_Commission plans on labelling palm oil as ‘risky’, and will ban the oil for use as biofuel. Smallholders stand ready to defeat EU’s unfair campaign against them.

4870 2018-11-12 17:35:51 This is a SHAMELESS comment. Which achievement ? Where is our GULF OIL money Mr MARADONIC KILLER OF DEMOCRACY?
4871 2018-11-12 17:35:48 And how do you care if they Snake Oil?
4872 2018-11-12 17:35:43 You're absolutely right - the Petro a snake oil token issued by snakes lol
4873 2018-11-12 17:35:39 It’s in line with their removal of palm oil products. It’s perfect timing.
4874 2018-11-12 17:35:37 Jerry only needs a .500 record (give or take) to sell his snake oil of hope to the millions of Cowboy fans who buy the "brand" and not the football team. Cowboys have become Coke, Apple or McDonalds and Jerry keeps raking in the $'s.

4877 2018-11-12 17:35:29 Have the oil gas companies surveyed or test drilled to establish presence of hydrocarbons?
4878 2018-11-12 17:35:17 Does anyone sell an oil diffuser humidifier here?
4879 2018-11-12 17:35:10 Now wait a minute...Didn't I just read a news story yesterday claiming that fish oil and vitamin D have no impact on heart health?

1984, it was a very good year...
4880 2018-11-12 17:35:08 @JackDaniels_US I have read a article that states that Jack Daniels is made/contains palm oil. Is this true?
4881 2018-11-12 17:35:07 Crude oil, talking energy.
4882 2018-11-12 17:35:07 Can't see much equivalence between steps to preserve the population of Orangutans, on the edge of extinction due to deforestation to grow Palm Oil for the West, and farming pigs, bred specifically for pork (pig genocide indeed!). Mouth ran away from brain at that point perhaps?
4883 2018-11-12 17:35:02 If Q is "Snake Oil" - why are YOU spending so much time talking about Q?
4884 2018-11-12 17:34:58 But again why would you buy a shale oil at the moment with gasoline cracks that are negative? How can you reduce gasoline production and increase distillate at the same time? particularly with IMO coming. Run cuts look more likely than loss of market share
4885 2018-11-12 17:34:57 Oh - he destabilizes the whole Middle East, invades a country under false pretenses because some greedy bastards wanted to make a killing on iraqi oil (and “security” - see Blackwater) ... and he gets a medal?...
4886 2018-11-12 17:34:48 What is the point in having a car manual if it doesn’t even accurately show you how to do things?? 

Mf’n can’t change the time in my car STILL and I got an oil change and they didn’t reset the light and I can’t figure it out either.

@ButlerToyotaIN
4887 2018-11-12 17:34:37 I wouldn’t trade my girlfriend @tasha_terrell for any woman in the world. This girl spent 10-15 minutes last night brushing my curls, putting coconut oil on my scalp and rubbing my head. 
4888 2018-11-12 17:34:35 So, are we going to ban palm oil then/

Me: What do you do out there?
Her: Whatch them and make sure they do it right
Me: So you just stand there?
Her: Pretty much
Me: And what if you're not watching
Her: They stop working
4892 2018-11-12 17:34:23 Wow, it is a known issue since the launch of the phone. And you want your customers to send a bug report so that you can take a look?

Go to forums, and search 'oil painting effect'. Do it.
4893 2018-11-12 17:34:19 @ABQJournal you might want to correct the jiffy lube free oil change for vets on your websight. They are only giving a 25% discount today.
4894 2018-11-12 17:34:13 Palm oil is in everything these days!!!!  Too political my ass...... too realistic more like it and causing issues for those companies that rely on palm oil for their products.  Money buys silence.
4895 2018-11-12 17:34:12 Abu Dhabi oil company hire's India's strategic oil storage. It has allowed foreign oil companies to store oil in storages on condition that the stockpile can be used by New Delhi in case of emergency .
4896 2018-11-12 17:34:10 @NutellaGlobal since you're possibly one of the biggest brands that uses palm oil what are you doing to counteract the deviation you are part of?
#DitchPalmOil #PutThePlanetBeforeProfit
4897 2018-11-12 17:34:05 What action will your concern turn into, Mr Gove?  What urgent steps will you and the government take to limit and reduce the use of palm oil in products sold in the UK and/or manufactured by UK companies?
4898 2018-11-12 17:33:47 I been using this coconut oil for a few days and yalll 
4899 2018-11-12 17:33:29 So even pellet ovens are not your thing then. Strange that they are promoted as being better for the environment than coal, oil, or gas. Why is that I wonder? Could it be because pellet ovens are CO2 neutral? Climate breakdown is the greatest threat to life on earth. Wake up!
4900 2018-11-12 17:33:20 Aquí Javier, yo creo que la industria del petróleo y de gas son la misma mafia. De hecho, casi todas las petroleras también hacen gas. De hecho al sector se le conoce como Oil&Gas
4901 2018-11-12 17:33:20 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr   You allow countries to buy DICTATOR Iran oil but your countrymen (Tides, Soros, Rockefellers etc) spend millions to block DEMOCRATIC Canadian oil from getting to world markets market.  Hypocritic?

4913 2018-11-12 17:31:46 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4914 2018-11-12 17:31:43 ehh its the same price to get it done at a shop changing ur own oil is pointless
4915 2018-11-12 17:31:40 It got peppermint oil in it and that helps hair growth so I guess , I never tried it lol
4916 2018-11-12 17:31:38 Well, there are many kinds of oils out there and they are not all created the same way. So I personally look for an oil with minimal ingredients and certified organic. I have my favorites for sure but you’re going to have to decide after you’ve tried them.
4917 2018-11-12 17:31:31 Everyone should watch @hasanminhaj show Patriot Act @netflix, I think he does an amazing job talking about things we should all be talking about. We need to stop Big Oil from getting government subsidies, we need to move to renewable clean energies ASAP.
4918 2018-11-12 17:31:30 we've heard more of this in the past. Intimidation won't reduce oil price nor dollar exchange rate. Check yourself.

4930 2018-11-12 17:30:43 Oil prices rose, set for its largest one-day increase in a month after Saudi Arabia said OPEC and its partners believed demand was softening enough to warrant an output cut of 1 million barrels per day
4931 2018-11-12 17:30:38 Peel your beets and a sweet potato. Toss in oil. Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, 2 tsp brown sugar. Stir to coat. Bake at 375. Add a little more sugar as it cooks, twice, to caramelize, stirring after each addition.

4951 2018-11-12 17:28:43 Do you not realise that production drives production too?! How do markets develop for new products otherwise? Not noticed the battle between oil producers and fracking industry as oilies increased production to lower price and so put the other out of business?
4952 2018-11-12 17:28:38 Following recent sharp declines in oil prices the Saudi government appears willing to sacrifice revenues to address oversupplied oil markets. Kuwait has also said it was “discussing production cuts”.

4956 2018-11-12 17:28:30 Interesting to note that the market was down and has been trending down all year — since end of 2017.

The market liked the tax cuts 

Now they are concerned about TRADE WAR, OIL SHORTAGES, CLIMATE DISASTERS, AND DEFICITS!

4982 2018-11-12 17:25:55 The VITAL study evaluated fish oil that contained a mix of EPA and DHA at lower doses in people with no history of heart disease and was negative.

4983 2018-11-12 17:25:47 Seems like a huge waste of energy. Plastic wrapping solid oil will need huge energy input. Then more energy required by the end user to convert back to a liquid. Just to avoid building freaking pipelines which can move huge volumes safely & efficiently.

4989 2018-11-12 17:24:57 Adding to the cost of already severely devalued Cdn oil will not encourage investment in Canadian resources. I know we need to innovate, but, the most efficient environmentally safe is still pipelines. That is if we can get the governments and eco terrorists out of the way!

5005 2018-11-12 17:23:01 Yup bread!Especially with feta, garlic & finely chopped black olives, thyme & lemon & a little olive oil & stuffed into either chicken thighs or a lamb breast..bloody lovely  
Do the sausage meat thing too - sage n onion but breadcrumbs really fill it out (in a breast of lamb)
5006 2018-11-12 17:22:58 Nuh hand shall harm u president God is in it, he pours his cup of oil on your head infect u are the chosen one. My greetings to u sir.
5007 2018-11-12 17:22:54 Theres a lot of things I disagree with regarding Greenpeace but I concur with the issue of this commercial. Indonesia in particular is notorious for destroying their own rainforests to cultivate unsustainable palm oil.
5008 2018-11-12 17:22:53 People still lying that bio oil works?
5009 2018-11-12 17:22:45 "Data is the new oil? No: Data is the new soil." ~David McCandless
5010 2018-11-12 17:22:44 That’s a fact ... that $50 oil change is worth every penny. You won’t ever catch me posing on the floor with a filter at that .
5011 2018-11-12 17:22:41 my mom just told me “just how you like intense emotions well shit that feeling from the oil is the same thing stop being a little bitch” 
5012 2018-11-12 17:22:26  it will not. Order the one from the link I sent you. You need the hydration! Also make sure you sealing at night with an oil or good ol vaseline.

5014 2018-11-12 17:22:23 Do you know how many holidays I’ve missed with my husband? Too many to count. Do you know how many more I’d miss with him for him to protect dumbasses like Hogg? A million more. He is proud to be a Soldier and I am proud of him! #SaluteToService
5015 2018-11-12 17:22:23 Why did you have to go and ruin it? Please cut out the S*n as well as Palm Oil - both aren’t healthy for this planet!
5016 2018-11-12 17:22:20 It's okay, I looked it up, their palm oil isn't crude and comes from sustainable sources, so it seems their plantations don't affect deforestation.
5017 2018-11-12 17:22:16 @CostaCoffee please can you let me know if the palm oil used in your products is sustainably sourced? #PalmOil #savetheorangutans

5020 2018-11-12 17:22:08 “No President is above the law.” Our party says, shortly after former Vice President @JoeBiden gives a medal to a man who sent us to an oil war that’s lasted 17 years & was started on a lie.

I was an anti-war activist before and I will continue to be one now. No more hypocrisy.
5021 2018-11-12 17:22:07 I want some coconut oil for my body
5022 2018-11-12 17:22:00 I notice you don't have an answer to my question. Lets pretend your figures are correct. Then why is an oil producing, net energy and food exporting (Look it up if you don't believe me) *still* struggling? Are you going to blame the SG when the economy is reserved to Westminster?
5023 2018-11-12 17:22:00 Me? I've had enough of oil.
5024 2018-11-12 17:21:49 @ByMarkJaffe The oil/gas drilling near Rocky Flats is not going away. Highlands is now looking at site adjacent to Superior neighborhood. Please DM me and I'll send you details.

And you are waiting for a man who works in an oil company, a doctor,an international business man. My sister, read the Bible
5026 2018-11-12 17:21:30 Thank you for sharing - I didn't know this. Now that I do know, i will boycott products with palm oil.

TIA
5029 2018-11-12 17:21:12 Rang-tan has an important story to share about the environmental impacts of unsustainable palm oil. 

We can all play a role in safeguarding the orangutan's home by only choosing products made with sustainable palm oil, which protects wildlife habitats and rainforests.
5030 2018-11-12 17:21:11 When america hears the New World has oil
5031 2018-11-12 17:21:11 Took my car in for an oil change and of course the repairs are now piling up. Bout to be broke til tax refund season
5032 2018-11-12 17:21:00 Indian markets just realized oil has found its near term bottom! Even Oil wants to be range bound.

5037 2018-11-12 17:20:43 No he is not qualified to be AG, just like Trump, Whitaker had to pay 26 million for defrauding people. Trump had to pay 25 million for defrauding people. They are both Snake Oil Salesman who think they are above the law. Birds of a feather flock together!!.
5038 2018-11-12 17:20:41 I reviewed on the blog - all perfect for the festive season! Love the lip oil especially! 
5039 2018-11-12 17:20:40 Only if the leftist would see the light and the utter fiscal power between the US and Canada we have if we could team up and go against OPEC to truly help bring competition to the oil market. Talk about job growth and fiscal responsibility.
5040 2018-11-12 17:20:36 It’s all fine and well people sharing this Iceland advert and talking about how sad it is but the same people won’t recycle, don’t make a conscious effort to buy food with no palm oil, still use plastic cups straws ect...
5041 2018-11-12 17:20:28 Two tail, either way it plays...

5042 2018-11-12 17:20:17 @Tesco please can you let me know if the palm oil you use in your sandwiches is sustainably sourced? #PalmOil #savetheorangutans

5060 2018-11-12 17:18:39 I’ve been taking CBD oil flavored with mint essential oil for awhile now. Today I have discovered that my pee has a slight minty aroma.
5061 2018-11-12 17:18:31 You forgot a very important product....Oil.
5062 2018-11-12 17:18:27 If  we  truly  wanted  to  send  them  a  message ,  we  would  cancel  oil  contracts ....  that hurts  them  the  most  and allows small Canada to be an  example ...  canceling arms deals hurts  Canada considerably more , and  will  have  little effect
5063 2018-11-12 17:18:24 The Hillary hot sauce has got to be the most blatant and most obvious act of condescension I have ever seen in my life! And Hillary, Obama and Biden all would go back and forth in their accents to play to their audience. All phony, snake oil salesmen!
5064 2018-11-12 17:18:24 Khashoggi thing is the most interesting.  Trumps party is moving to disown Saudi’s.  I think he has no choice but to follow.  Turkey is not backing off.  All piles back into higher oil prices.
5065 2018-11-12 17:18:14 Well done Iceland, I sent a message to Tesco months ago asking if their Palm oil products at from a sustainable source, I’m still waiting on a reply

5072 2018-11-12 17:17:56 You may ignore shipping and banking sanctions but Buying medicine needs money, to earn money you should have a job. But jobs are declining because of sanctions. As well the government suffers budget deficit caused by oil sanctions to buy enough food and medicines at fair prices
5073 2018-11-12 17:17:54 @Headshoulders does your shampoo contain palm oil?
5074 2018-11-12 17:17:51 Not feeling so good  just took some oregano oil God's natural antibiotic & antiviral. Isn't it too early for the flu?
5075 2018-11-12 17:17:49 Power over the oil industri in Iran , USA England will control everything they need.
5076 2018-11-12 17:17:46 You use the "fair, fairly" way to much. I'm not buying your snake oil.

5081 2018-11-12 17:17:23 Why is an oil rich, net food and energy exporting country being 'subsidised' by a deficit producing rUK? Why is Norway, our neighbour who has extracted less oil, far richer? You don't seem to understand that it's the UK that drains Scotland, not the other way around.
5082 2018-11-12 17:17:20 America will only intervene in conflicts of their own interest, i.e. oil. They don't care about human suffering, children dying, persecution of minorities, etc, etc. Yet they supply arms to the perpetrators of these criminal acts. America, land of the free?
5083 2018-11-12 17:17:13 My guess is oil prices rising.

5086 2018-11-12 17:17:01 Predictable, but MSM is blaming oil prices and tech stock drops. Yeah, right.
5087 2018-11-12 17:16:55 อิอิ อยู่คุยกันก่อนจิ
5088 2018-11-12 17:16:50 Today I was shopping for groceries and looking at ice creams and I read the ingredients on a brand I had been interested in and thank god I thoroughly read it bc it said it had peanut oil in it?!?! No where did it say anything with nuts on the allergen section. Rude.
5089 2018-11-12 17:16:49 The oil light and the tire pressure light cane on in my car yay Monday
5090 2018-11-12 17:16:36 Yo hit up @Bonjouronneya for all of your body butter, face scrub and beard oil needs, her link is on her page  prices looking good good
5091 2018-11-12 17:16:34 If her tongue ain’t ever made your body lock up like an ‘87 Impala with no oil, she ain’t the one sis
5092 2018-11-12 17:16:29 Not to mention the backup plan to rely on Saudi Arabian oil with the loss of Iranian oil supplies. Somebody is getting paid.
5093 2018-11-12 17:16:25 WHY?The whole world must know that for  the production of palm oil taken from the red fruits of these trees,whole palm plantations are destroyed and the habitat of many animals of Borneo and Malaysia too.This animation is perfect way to let childen, future adults, know about it
5094 2018-11-12 17:16:24 Yeah true, well apart from from the vote rigging, that's a piece of cake for the brit establishment & it's not like they're known worldwide for their fairness or keeping their noses out of other countries with oil, illegally
5095 2018-11-12 17:16:19 Don't be silly.
That would cost money.
And all the money belongs to the billionaires.
Be glad they're allowing us to pay for the active military -- to protect their oil, shipping, and other international investments.
5096 2018-11-12 17:15:54 I'll bet he was smooth - most snake oil salesmen are and have slick moves, a lying tongue and a deceit second to none.
5097 2018-11-12 17:15:41 Trump's a con man. He's not winning. He's never been winning. He propagandizes winning, using a base of thoughtless people who simply trust him. Meanwhile, he's ripping the country to shreds. A drop in oil prices is dragging stocks. Trump knows that. He's not that stupid
5098 2018-11-12 17:15:29 I'm a bloke, I'm British  and I use products that don't contain palm oil...

Not hard is it

Insufferable twat!!
5099 2018-11-12 17:15:29 Hi @Shell_UKLtd I would like to report a robbery. I was at your petrol station, Junction 11 off the M20 and the diesel was £1.56 a litre...£1.56 a litre!! Crude oil prices are dropping, daylight robbery!

5101 2018-11-12 17:15:22 At some point the sheer insipid nastiness of the Azerbaijan government is going to implode. Tbe only reason it hasn’t is propping up by Western oil interests, particularly BP.

5103 2018-11-12 17:15:09 Just seeing if I’m following correctly. I don’t trade oil so.. before higher prices were good. Showed growth. Now it’s down so it’s viewed as negative but you think positive because it will help Europe and Asia. Right, wrong?
5104 2018-11-12 17:15:06 anyways...... @tomsofmaine emailed me back and verified their palm oil is rspo certified......can now sleep peacefully

5116 2018-11-12 17:14:17 CNBC TV traders WERE ALL RECOMMENDING oil stocks in the face of @realDonaldTrump & @TeamTrump talk of energy independence, net exporter & Saudi assistance. THAT WAS A BAD trade. Fed will NOT overhike.  Continue to avoid overpriced high-flyers. BUY/ADD DEEP-VALUE BARGAINS.
5117 2018-11-12 17:14:16 Nonsense. Most of the deals Trump is making are bad. Betting on Cole for instance is worse than betting on sperm oil  @ the dawn of the age of petroleum

Controlling countries like North Korea depends on effective alliances & coalitions. Trump is withdrawing from those. Bad move.
5118 2018-11-12 17:14:15 It is actually INSANE the amount of everyday products that contain palm oil
5119 2018-11-12 17:13:48 Norway own their oil fields hmmm
5120 2018-11-12 17:13:47 So you accept that prerog can change law? & pre De Keyser, (see Duke LJ in CA for example),  prerog could be used as alternative to statute to change legal position? Burmah Oil (but pay comp)? Northumbria? (*maybe* Ship Money?), Post Office v Estuary Radio?
5121 2018-11-12 17:13:47 You are not giving enough credit to opposition. They deserve some credit in reducing oil prices!!!

I would even say that they deserve at least one more term as opposition for this achievement alone 
5122 2018-11-12 17:13:42 I mean, once will kill them they'll become oil ~eventually~

We're just planning ahead, right?
5123 2018-11-12 17:13:35 Your presidency will be defined by the greatest correction in the stock market in history, when government interferes in a free economy only bad things happen. The auto sector, oil, manufacturing, agriculture all suffering from tariffs.

Plastics, palm oil, and other massive pollutants should be reduced until nil.
5127 2018-11-12 17:13:18 Anyone who has watched the beautiful Iceland ad, just understand that the BaE folks are negotiating with lovely Malaysia for an arms contract and the Malaysians harvest palm oil and they might not buy our lovely guns if we say nasty things about Palm Oil. ..

5135 2018-11-12 17:12:53 So if a information channel isn't fully transparent it is snake oil.  I guess this means that all your conversations that we are not included in are snake oil.  Simple solution for the 50 million followers, just have Sarah or President Trump state Q is snake oil.  Ok?
5136 2018-11-12 17:12:52 Honestly, I feel like I don't have room to speak. I always knew the problem with palm oil but shrugged it off as "I'm vegan so I'm doing enough" and consumed vegan palm oil products anyways. Sure omnis are being hypocritical, but I can't say that I'm not as well.
5137 2018-11-12 17:12:51 Yep after leave in definitely seal with an oil...argan is usually good for me
5138 2018-11-12 17:12:41 ain’t nun slick to a can of oil baby.
5139 2018-11-12 17:12:39 yes mama just regular tea tree oil, it should have like a strong powerful mint smell, the other thing i use is a serum/oil that’s literally nothin but vitamin c it cleared up my face better than anything i’ve ever used
5140 2018-11-12 17:12:37 Rang-tan's story highlights the devastating impact unsustainable palm oil can have on the environment. However, banning palm oil could have a more harmful effect on Rang-tan's home as less efficient crops would need to be grown.A better solution is to support sustainable palm oil
5141 2018-11-12 17:12:37 Ahhh shit.  This is horrible.
5142 2018-11-12 17:12:36 I would love to oil up those ass treeks
5143 2018-11-12 17:12:30 6

Main reason national debt has soared over $20 trillion since Reagan became President - welfare to corporate welfare queen parasites

Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, coal, oil, banks, Comcast, prescription drugs, electricity companies, Nestle, Pepsi, Coca Cola, etc
5144 2018-11-12 17:12:20 Stop buying Saudi oil. Buy Canadian oil.
5145 2018-11-12 17:12:06 Our commitment to using sustainable palm oil has also been recognised by The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in their palm oil buyers scorecard. Thank you for the time and trouble you have taken to contact us on this matter. [3/3]
5146 2018-11-12 17:12:00 Ahhh, that's interesting... the whole thing has seriously made me wonder why Linda McCartney's sausages use palm oil... seems a bit odd.  xx
5147 2018-11-12 17:11:53 This is assured through meeting standards set by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and through independent certification of our manufacturing facilities. [2/3]
5148 2018-11-12 17:11:48 Agreed but my guess is we already have our answer.
5149 2018-11-12 17:11:40 Dear Julie, this is an important topic to us as well. We can confirm that the limited palm oil we buy is all from certified sustainable sources that avoid damaging the tropical rainforest and biodiversity of South East Asia. [1/3]
5150 2018-11-12 17:11:33 This means we can suspend all funds to these countries, UN and NATO.
5151 2018-11-12 17:11:33 It’s good did it today... u got to try cinnamon and a teaspoon of coconut nut oil......DAAAAMN!
5152 2018-11-12 17:11:31 This woman constantly is freaking out about small shit like getting her brakes down or her oil changed. Like freakouts that you’d have if you were kidnapped or your house was on fire
5153 2018-11-12 17:11:22 Crude oil will be the topic when the @CNBCFuturesNow crew joins the @HalftimeReport --Will OPEC's announcement boost prices? ---where does this leave frackers? --we cover it all at 1245pm
5154 2018-11-12 17:11:17 Doesn’t really care about what Haftar said or not. The fact is : he can’t attack Tripoli with the forces at his disposal right now (cf. Derna, « Murzuk basin », oil crescent...). « Soft approach » is probably better suited for him...
5155 2018-11-12 17:11:12 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: soggy crust with wet coconut oil and pineapple.
5156 2018-11-12 17:11:11 Yes it does, or sounds like a steam roller running over empty oil drums... 
5157 2018-11-12 17:11:09 Mackerel (saba) or sardine (aji) probably better for the oil.
5158 2018-11-12 17:11:06 We must be the most naive people in the world. We sell our oil for $13. and buy foreign oil for $70.Name another country that wouldvdo this.
5159 2018-11-12 17:11:00 This 82 year-old man has been a Kansas Senator for TWENTY-ONE YEARS.  So he's not ruling out a FIFTH run for Senate. Come on, Kansas: isn't time to get rid of this guy? He voted to exclude oil and gas smokestacks from mercury regulations and other terrible things.

5161 2018-11-12 17:10:45 I don’t see why you can’t state publicly whether or not the palm oil used your products is responsibly sourced. It’s not a private matter. Please advise which is the case.
5162 2018-11-12 17:10:42 I been sitting in Honda for over an hour waiting on a oil change & tire check. I’m about to lose my shit
5163 2018-11-12 17:10:40 Sorry people, Trump is absolutely right. The way he campaigned and the absence of ridiculous "blue wave" didn't allow anything to be "baked in". This election was a toss up. Oil stocks were a factor. We are hitting economy numbers out of the park.
5164 2018-11-12 17:10:38 Currently searching for the response and info on still selling oil, will let you know if find anything 
5165 2018-11-12 17:10:33 What we call fish in oil?
5166 2018-11-12 17:10:25 If you are worried about a liquidity trap LONG OIL. Prices are currently undervalued. Rising rates make extraction alot less compettive. Plus The markets have yet to price in Iran sactions.
5167 2018-11-12 17:10:20 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
5168 2018-11-12 17:10:19 I dunno tommy.  Not sure I’m with Emmanuel on this one.   If our PM was a bit more of a Nationalist maybe we wouldn’t be losing $100 MM a day on our oil exports but he and Butts and Catherine and Al and George S are laughing at all of us.

5170 2018-11-12 17:10:04 Great to see this @michaelgove ! 
I trust that you will be supporting the call by @MollyMEP for the Clearcast decision to be reviewed.  
I also wonder what additional action on palm oil DEFRA/HMG will be taking now?
5171 2018-11-12 17:10:04 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
5172 2018-11-12 17:10:03 Inverse corelation between oil and and sensex is not borne out by past data
5173 2018-11-12 17:09:46 No, the stock market is cooling because of the economy. When you are borrowing a trillion dollars a year, it puts additional pressure on interest rates. That and rising oil prices are leaving consumers without extra money to spend. But great cover!
5174 2018-11-12 17:09:44 มันคงเป็นสันดานไปแล้วอ่ะค่ะ เหนื่อยใจ~
5175 2018-11-12 17:09:42 @PiyushGoyal ji if you make it open for Kin of ex CIL employees and retired CIL employees it will@be oversubscribed by zillion X ..enough to buy oil till it lasts for the country...just saying ... many will buy for sentimental reasons  ..
5176 2018-11-12 17:09:41 Super cute...
5177 2018-11-12 17:09:25 Hahahaha. Kase lge hove han patvari ic admi ko naik prove krne. Ic pic me oil para hai maan lia. Lakn ic se ye prove ni hota k wo kbi drink krta e nai, or buhat naik parsa bn gea.
5178 2018-11-12 17:09:23 this happened to me with CBD, it's like: i said it might be cut with snake oil, pls don't invite me to a deskside
5179 2018-11-12 17:09:22 I feel like I’ve seen a version of this episode.  It’s the one where everyone in Walnut Grove is being conned by a snake oil salesman... except in this episode no one is listening to Pa Ingalls.
5180 2018-11-12 17:09:22 No it's not.  The market is being hurt by sanctions on Iranian oil, so Saudi Arabia is doing as expected, reducing production.
5181 2018-11-12 17:09:21 I can clearly remember $.39 in early 70s. After the oil embargo around 73/74 it did get back as low as $.65 in Oklahoma, late 70s. I was buying diesel in the mid to late 90s right around $1.00, sometimes dipping into the $.90s.
5182 2018-11-12 17:09:01 SAS and Marines are specifically trained in "looking after" "helping" Oil rigs...
5183 2018-11-12 17:08:45 It's a gobal currency & a store of value?

Okay, granted, but so is the dollar, euro, yen, gold, oil....................

Believe in the premise and technology, but that means nothing about future price or value.

 BTC has been in a downtrend since around 15,715.

That's a fact.
5184 2018-11-12 17:08:43 and see what happens to the price of oil when the Shale Oil industry in the U.S. goes tits up.
5185 2018-11-12 17:08:25 Otw here I hit like a oil container, lowkey got me like dang.
5186 2018-11-12 17:08:19 kmaren abis keujanan, nyampe rumah dibilas doang gak langsung dilumasin rantenya, tadi cek ricek muter roda belakang gretek-gretek bener...

5187 2018-11-12 17:08:02 Cutting him up in pieces simply not humane. Sounds a lot like an abortion here in the states. Khashoggi may you rest in piece, you will never get justice as long as we need oil.
5188 2018-11-12 17:07:55 They won't complain cos there is someone somewhere gauging their oil
5189 2018-11-12 17:07:50 He won't arrest sarcozy but that dick wants Libya's oil contracts. Which Italy controls. 

It's not your nationalism that's to blame it's your lack of morality. All of u freaks and those who voted you in.
5190 2018-11-12 17:07:44 I don't think the Iceland Ad should have been banned. Our reliance on palm oil is causing widespread destruction.
Food by Toby does not use ingredients containing palm oil.

5192 2018-11-12 17:07:31 THANK YOU. When I'm better rested, I'll make a small QUINOA SALAD....Red Onions, Garlic, Ginger, Tomatoes, Fresh Coriander, Chilies, Lime Juice & Olive Oil.
5193 2018-11-12 17:07:13 Getting an oil change , Veteran day gift!
5194 2018-11-12 17:07:08 Monica is going to have to start paying for my oil change bc deez drives to Dallas every weekend is somtn els...... js
5195 2018-11-12 17:06:59 Its still weird that Hollywood managed to find a way to insert modern day military soldiers into the upcoming monster hunter movie. I wouldnt be surprised if the movie ended with the military invading the monster hunter universe for all their oil.
5196 2018-11-12 17:06:57 It’s totally related, I’m taking a mix of vitamins to neutralise that - plus CBD oil, message me if you want dets x
5197 2018-11-12 17:06:50 Being taught how to change my oil & checking my tire pressure . Really be coming in handy 
5198 2018-11-12 17:06:45 Naw I think its due to trade uncertainty, Iran and friends( many US allies) trying to give oil while circumventing sanctions which pissed of the U.S.A which then has caused more rounds of sanctions. Just use cryptocurrency bypass the US bogus sanctions since they're out of place
5199 2018-11-12 17:06:38 absolutely - dollar up/oil up again - a really bad mixture for SA and probably to continue - I thought the dollar may need a week or two to digest the election but it needed a few hours
5200 2018-11-12 17:06:35 When was the last discussion with FDA about using mineral oil placebo

5203 2018-11-12 17:06:27 Saudis want to pump up OIL price but if US markets were to keep falling like this its not gonna happen

5205 2018-11-12 17:05:48 Vitamin e oil is good for spot treatment it’s really expensive if you’re using REAL vitamin e oil I wouldn’t be solely using that all over my face as moisturizer
5206 2018-11-12 17:05:47 Thanks for highlighting this @michaelgove. Now please can you look to regulate our use of non-sustainable palm oil. No further deforestation should be conscionable. Please take a stand and try to galvanise international action.
5207 2018-11-12 17:05:45 In case of 10% or so upmove in DXY what will happen to global equities..if oil hits 57-58 lvl that's certainly a strong possibility. Eager to hear from u..
5208 2018-11-12 17:05:42 LOL-talk about sweeping assumptions. Clearly you haven’t met many atheists! Assuming we’re identical doesn’t say much for your level of intelligence,neither does trying to study at 1.30am.Burning the midnight oil is the least effective way to study, so no brownie points for you.
5209 2018-11-12 17:05:37 Change oil and use a Snapchat filter
5210 2018-11-12 17:05:29 We know how skin react when we drink a ltr of less waterit gets fucked up for2-4 days, on top of that you eat food cooked with heavy oil, for some people, you say bye to clear skin if you skip ONE step of skin routine, hormonal changes and many more but he's doing drugs 
5211 2018-11-12 17:05:22 I would say he is standing there with the cogs turning, but somebody forgot to oil his gears a lonnnnnng time ago. Chotus. Cheeto of the United States.
5212 2018-11-12 17:05:06 15.3 bg of #ethanol production helped bring net oil import dependence down to 25% in 2016. The RFS has helped cut net oil import dependence by more than half since enactment.

5215 2018-11-12 17:04:51 I check all biscuits and cereals and have only ever bought peanut butter without palm oil. I have never bought Nutella for this reason. Where I fall down is shampoos and other beauty products. I never check lipstick for example.  And I should. We all should!

Yep pay no attention to the man behind the curtain or the snake oil he is selling.
5222 2018-11-12 17:04:29 Beard balm or beard oil? The stuff I’ve been using of beard oil seems to not be on the shelves at two places locally. So hit me up my bearded military brothers and tell me what you use and what works best for you #beards #Military #veterans #barbershop
5223 2018-11-12 17:04:21 Try an essential oil. I’d start with lavender or eucalyptus, then lemon of those 2 don’t work. Good luck! 
5224 2018-11-12 17:04:21 this man is actin up like I won’t rub some oil on my titties and walk out on him
5225 2018-11-12 17:04:20 This is totally skewed metrics. Government changed the process how they calculate inflation. They don't include oil price in the inflation index. I think they also remove food grain price.
5226 2018-11-12 17:04:14 Hi Hilary, happy to help! The RSPO certification is helping to transform the Palm Oil industry and ensure that companies are producing and trading sustainably.
5227 2018-11-12 17:04:13 My target is 1673$ ,but this market looks so weak ... no leadership nothing Oil up but oil stocks don't care $XLE
5228 2018-11-12 17:04:11 Hi, all I want for Christmas is a reduction in plastic waste production, sustainable palm oil production that doesn't jeopardise the lives of the remaining wild orangutans. I'm not sure from your advert where you stand on that. Could you point me in the right direction please?
5229 2018-11-12 17:04:02 That's funny because the people who actually know what they are talking about say its due to Apple and Oil. So what is your explanation for the previous weeks of the bad stock market?  Oh wait is Jr. being indicted this week?

5233 2018-11-12 17:03:53 @LiveCBDHealthy does cbd oil show up on drug tests
5234 2018-11-12 17:03:47 Trump´s cabinet is full or corporate elites, they´re Wall street bankers, heads of oil corporations, CEO´s of huge pharmacists and those you are backing, the millionaire elites. And they are using the uneducated to carry on their pocket filling

5240 2018-11-12 17:03:18 Will you be addressing the use of "sustainable" palm oil rather than solely focusing on "No Palm Oil"? 

@chesterzoo has a lot of research about this so it is only fair that you bring this into the conversation … this must not become PR for @IcelandFoods but about #Orangutans
5241 2018-11-12 17:03:18 I need to find some good quality gardenia oil
5242 2018-11-12 17:03:08 when southerns say oil, wash, and water >>>
5243 2018-11-12 17:03:06 I love them I have bought too. It is a little high maintenance. Like it burns oil. Tires are pricey. But it is fun to drive.
5244 2018-11-12 17:03:04 A Porsche kind of Monday at AHT! Servicing all models. From oil service to major rebuilds. Make an appointment 903-561-8145
5245 2018-11-12 17:02:59 How much does it bother you that the Saudis aren’t particularly cultured, and how much is it that they have lots oil and Lebanon does not?
5246 2018-11-12 17:02:55 It takes time to remove an ingredient from a product and find a sustainable replacement with out taking away the taste or desire customers enjoy. As a company with a wide variety of products they are gradually removing palm oil as much as they can
5247 2018-11-12 17:02:54 Not a oil pipeline a....water pipeline....duh!!!!!
5248 2018-11-12 17:02:50 @HotelChocolat I see your previous reply to another tweet re #PalmOil. Can you confirm that all the palm oil in your products is RSPO certified as your suppliers being members of RSPO doesn't guarantee that. Love that you're going palm oil free
5249 2018-11-12 17:02:35 I’m sure there’s fire weed out there that doesn’t taste like dirt maybe you should get better bags and how is oil more illegal than cocaine??
5250 2018-11-12 17:02:28 I know tbh. It’s not something I’m proud of. I just recently got my oil changed tho so I’m good 
5251 2018-11-12 17:02:27 Hi Clare, this is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5252 2018-11-12 17:02:25 Can’t this oil also work for stuttering???
5253 2018-11-12 17:02:25 My oil was more than half and just fell and shattered  beautiful morning
5254 2018-11-12 17:02:25 I remember when I was arguing with David Lewis in the late 1970s for our own independence from US (and other foreign) oil and gas industry and he was saying it was a naive position. He was my political science prof and we fought a lot. Been watching this a long time.
5255 2018-11-12 17:02:16 You don't know that for sure
We did too much to destabilize Libya and we haven't done enough to end the fighting for Syria all because Libya has oil and Syria does not
5256 2018-11-12 17:02:14 Sometimes i forget, I was trying to buy some oil strangles the other day over the dog and i lost it up a horses arse.
5257 2018-11-12 17:02:12 Scotland was (and still is) allways in favor of a national oil company so once independent thats one of the first things they will do.
5258 2018-11-12 17:02:02 pres trump you have let the American people down. I,m referring to your sanctions on irainian oil. what on earth possessed you to grant waivers to 85% of irans biggest customers. you shot yourself in the foot
5259 2018-11-12 17:02:01 If you'd be interested in trying CBD oil for chronic pain and anxiety, we'd love to answer any questions you may have 
5260 2018-11-12 17:01:51 There's much more oil than we can ever consume before choking to death on its smoke. #gogreen #altenergy
5261 2018-11-12 17:01:45 Lil tiger strip... lil dimples... lotta ass... lotta oil

5262 2018-11-12 17:01:25 situation in Israel concerns me for oil only because Hamas' rocket supply comes from Iran. an Israel -Iran outright war isn't immediate, but always keep an eye on
5263 2018-11-12 17:01:22 So in 7 weeks you will have 100% certified palm oil?
5264 2018-11-12 17:01:22 Did you know cold pressed Lemon #essentialoil is #phototoxic and steam #distilled Lemon essential oil is not?
5265 2018-11-12 17:01:19 Negative feedback loops are terrible for the economy and the workers, but the continued supply destruction will only bring less oil to a market in deficit and higher prices. Our politicians and their policies will be responsible for soaring prices in the next few years.
5266 2018-11-12 17:01:09 I know. But that's not the point here. The point is that going palm oil free apparently can't be subject of a TV ad in the UK. Isn't that strange? 

Apart from that, the ad shows some of the many problems in the palm oil sector. I think  awareness raising about that is valuable.
5267 2018-11-12 17:01:07 Also, if someone found a bunch of oil and sold it, that would boost GDP but not wage compensation.

5271 2018-11-12 17:00:56 I wouldn't say this song helped me find paid employment, but it did help me complete 60 oil paintings in 60 days when I was working on my senior show in 2014. I played this song all the time when I was in the studio!

5273 2018-11-12 17:00:50 Norway has accumulated an oil fund because they have high taxes.   We haven’t because we don’t .   Idiot
5274 2018-11-12 17:00:49 there is no oil without squeezing the olives; no real joy without sorrow
5275 2018-11-12 17:00:38 Dow down 400 at midday. Analysts point to drop in tech stocks, reversal of slide in oil prices, looming spectre of Brexit no-deal, worries over impact of Wednesday's US inflation data on rate hikes. On Twitter, Trump blames 'prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems.'
5276 2018-11-12 17:00:38 Is it true that alternative oil crops have much lower yields and require a lot more land?

5288 2018-11-12 16:59:50 UK sells lease to drill to highest bidder and tax extracted oil. Instead of starting a national oilcompany like in most countries, Norway good example, so instead of making propper money, they gone the lazy way and only collect taxes.
5289 2018-11-12 16:59:48 Guess he hasn't bothered to get to grips with the nuance of palm oil - we're all sick of experts, right?

5292 2018-11-12 16:59:45 Palm oil is just plain evil.
5293 2018-11-12 16:59:45 I think they may be more true-believer than how I imagine snake oil salesmen to be. (I know a few of both.) But I just wish there was a way to motivate people, and to also make them feel their worth, without cult-like methods.
5294 2018-11-12 16:59:30 A university professor won't give Greenpeace back a study they have given $20 million to do on 'climate warming' then give them a study that says 'oil is great for the environment & the ocean.'

Duh.
5295 2018-11-12 16:59:20 the size of the US foreign aid package to the PA was ~$320 million not incl. UNRWA funds, the Palestinian authority (which it must be said isn’t in control of Gaza) has a martyrs fund that pays terrorists for the number of Israelis killed or injured worth $330 million every year
5296 2018-11-12 16:59:08 Preparation tip: thaw in refrigerator per instructions, then heat through in a frying pan (with lid) and a little olive oil. The olive oil is critical or the burger will stick. Seriously, aside from all the nutritional/ecological/humane benefits, these 100% vegan burgers ROCK!!
5297 2018-11-12 16:59:02 good lets hope they are paying attention these days. nothing personal just want our team to win and stop being the laughing stock of the NHL.  Bring in Joe Quineville, find out what it takes to get Nylander and how to ditch Lucic and his contract.  convince him to retire.
5298 2018-11-12 16:59:00 (Though seriously it's hard to fathom why they did it. They didn't even get better access to Iraq's oil than they had before, and it made Iran a lot stronger).

5300 2018-11-12 16:58:58 Pretty ironic when the postmodernists are the ones selling the snake oil. You could easily replace this with a bottle promising that papers about dog-humping and conceptual penises help root out injustice.
5301 2018-11-12 16:58:46 Unfortunately I'm not surprised. What can we do to get these big oil companies on board already?!

5304 2018-11-12 16:58:33 Once again - you know nothing about how any of this works.  Oil and the tech sector are driving losses today.  You are an IDIOT.  Just keep blaming everyone else.  This will all be over soon.  Presidential Harassment.  Another gaslighting term.
5305 2018-11-12 16:58:31 You haven’t lost money unless you sell. This will bounce back and move much higher. Mineral oil sham is orchestrated and while it worked it is unfounded. Vascepa is a game changer, only a matter of time

5320 2018-11-12 16:56:45 How is it that he thinks they’re better than anyone else when every country Muslims occupy is defunk, war laden, and violent.  Do Muslim countries, produce products, create global companies, create technologies, export something other than oil, etc?  Simply said, no.
5321 2018-11-12 16:56:45 Can't do both. Can't both exploit the oil down there *and* act in best interests of the planet. And what's best for the planet is best for Scotland. Not many issues are black and white, but this is one of them.
5322 2018-11-12 16:56:41 @ClickForTaz hey Taz, I was wondering if you could do a challange avoiding palm oil in products? like, a week without using palm oil products (food etc)?

Are you aware of a restauranteur lifting crude oil worth over 600bn in this admin?

5324 2018-11-12 16:56:33 I would recommend CBD oil, it helps me alot
5325 2018-11-12 16:56:25 Is it an empty threat? or empty muscle-flexing?
Nobody threatened Iranian tankers; only sanctions against "purchasing" Iranian oil.

A typical example of Iranians hollow shouting,
to show they are doing something, when they are actually doing nothing!
5326 2018-11-12 16:56:23 Bmw oil change today, apparently I’ve only put on 1500kms in 1 year. Sounds about right. Ha!

5330 2018-11-12 16:56:03 There are 8 gallons of oil in every tire. As far as i know, noone is even talking about the (probably impossible) manufacturing revolution that will be necessary, let alone working on a solution.

5334 2018-11-12 16:55:44 so far today, crude oil has done nothing after the opening gap.
5335 2018-11-12 16:55:40 REDUCE-IT is deeply flawded as mineral oil was used as the placebo. That is not acceptable as it is not biologically inert. LDL and CRP increased by 10 % and 30 % from baseline in the mineral oil placebo group (see Appendix). Mineral oil is not for human consumption. #AHA18
5336 2018-11-12 16:55:39 The first rule of mopping the kitchen floor is that I will immediately spill something bad the moment it's dry. Tonight: cooking oil.
5337 2018-11-12 16:55:31 Noone listens? I disagree. Propaganda must be called out. How were Trump fans conned if they weren't listening & buying every drop of snake oil?
5338 2018-11-12 16:55:31 Good on you. Michael. Shame @Channel4 @Turner @TurnerFdnInc @TedTurnerIII @ITV aren't as aware of the need to reduce palm oil deforestation as the UK env secretary. Too political @Clearcast ?

5347 2018-11-12 16:54:22 Why not use water instead of oil in trial
5348 2018-11-12 16:54:22 Then better look at Rockefeller’s too & claw back. Govt used oil & then that was standard oil. How abt Kennedy’s & scotch & all the pies they had fingers in.
5349 2018-11-12 16:54:19 I def fried some chicken yesterday. Lemme go google the pros of peanut oil cuz this is news to me.
5350 2018-11-12 16:54:18 You can always substitute peanut oil if you aren't allergic. The flavor of the oil changes the flavor of the brussel sprout. Udon bowls are one of my favorite  things.
5351 2018-11-12 16:54:17 Do you remember the days when we sold our oil to the Americans for $20 a barrel and imported oil from Saudi Arabia at $65?

5359 2018-11-12 16:53:39 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
5360 2018-11-12 16:53:17 The global oil economy has already started recovering though, but not in Alberta. Time alone wont solve the problem, pipelines plus time would solve the problem. Canada, with the help of our provincial government, has blocked pipelines and squandered time. People are legit mad.
5361 2018-11-12 16:53:16 Y las calefacciones de GAS OIL que contaminan el 45% para cuando.?
 O estas no contaminan.
5362 2018-11-12 16:53:09 What is your point? 

It's a no sum gain counter intelligence across the board.

Trump has said he needs Russian help in dealing with terrorism, at the same time he has struck Russia forces in Syria, secured oil trade with Germany (away from Russia)

5372 2018-11-12 16:52:02 Absolutely disgusted with @AudiUK - 3 year old car is 2 months out of warranty, has done 38,000 miles and now had an oil leak from the crankshaft. Audi won’t cover under good will even though this shouldn’t have happened. First class service? I think not.
5373 2018-11-12 16:51:56 As I’ve gotten older, I’ve sometimes faced a challenge maintaining regularity. I told you about the kombu-very helpful!  & a power food! But perhaps even more helpful in this respect is MCT oil. Dat can help any smooth character make a smooth move. From personal experience.
5374 2018-11-12 16:51:40 You're a Snake Oil Salesman. Explain to your potted plants that it will eventually cost so much that it bankrupts the nation.

5406 2018-11-12 16:48:17 The Iceland one is online - shame it's been banned for TV screening. I suspect someone in the Government has shares in a Palm Oil Factory.
5407 2018-11-12 16:48:06 Burned the midnight oil a bit last night  cheers buddy
5408 2018-11-12 16:48:05 Then samuel took the horn of oil and annointed  him in the midst of his brethren :and the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward .So Samuel rose up.and went to Ramah.1Sam16:13
5409 2018-11-12 16:48:04 @theschmidtshow @jonmosesvocals If plastic is made from oil, and oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, does that nean plastuc dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs?
5410 2018-11-12 16:47:59 After watching “who killed the electric car” this weekend, I’m confident in saying GM is planning on smoking this big oil cigarette right to the filter. After which, they will use the “we employ thousands” to get a bailout.
5411 2018-11-12 16:47:54 Random girl to her beau: I love your sweaty smell, darling

Mechanic, to me: bro we just overhauled a 1100cc Milwaukee engine. We sweaty.

Me: chill bro, our sweat mixed with engine oil. 

My bud. Ah Hoi of Sunway Cycles. He's kept me safe for decades.
5412 2018-11-12 16:47:29 #CongressEmployment   it's same like hair oil for hairless person. Good to talk but big float show.

A-1953 coup
B-To hell with the murderous Iranian regime. 
C-Never forget who put these horrible thugs in power.
D-Thereupon, SHAME ON US for putting one of the oldest/greatest nation on earth through hell so we could have their oil for the fraction of its worth.
5417 2018-11-12 16:47:18 They don't spend 90 percent of the proceed of oil on paying civil servants. Besides they don't export crude oil. That's the math.

5421 2018-11-12 16:47:07 The US discovered shale years ago making them less reliant on Canadian oil. MORE IMPORTANTLY, PM Trudeau is diversitying our economy. Canada must be more than a one industry economy if Canada is to survive and grow jobs.  Trudeau understands this. Scheer and Conservatives don't.
5422 2018-11-12 16:47:05 Dude, what are you talking about‽ I don’t live in MO.

I don’t like my senator stumping for a fake Democrat. Her record shows she voted with Trump 50% of the time. She took $250K from big oil and voted FOR Keystone. She’s as much a problem as any other crooked politician/Repub.
5423 2018-11-12 16:47:02 Remove the dot com boom from the economic data of the 90s; plod along with big auto and oil and housing. You get a little bump in productivity from computers and robots, but beyond that?
5424 2018-11-12 16:47:02 Waiting at Crozer Wellness Center in Havertown for my husband’s cataract surgery to begin. It was scheduled for an hour ago. @PennMedicine @ScheieEye this is the most spare, chintzy surgical waiting area I have ever been in: I have more amenities where I get my car’s oil changed!

5426 2018-11-12 16:46:59 Large oil fracking and coal operations are NEVER questioned as to the cause of these fires. We all know Cali is in the RING OF FIRE. Magma could be the cause of the fires.

5430 2018-11-12 16:46:34 In the short term, production cuts by OPEC and its allies could drive up prices. But in the long run, any such moves would be self-defeating. U.S. oil production is primed to keep skyrocketing.
5431 2018-11-12 16:46:33 @peterboghossian is committed to truth, facts, and reason. Referring to him a snake oil salesman is a threat to journalistic intergrity. It just makes the news look wrong. That man has saved me and other students so much money by teaching critical thinking and exposing charlatans
5432 2018-11-12 16:46:33 Its for a thing I'm doing for @DeSmogUK on Just Transition from oil to renewables. A really interesting project. Looking at Community Hydro projects in Arrochar today but got a chance to visit here so jumped at it.
5433 2018-11-12 16:46:15 oil based dgn water based?
5434 2018-11-12 16:46:09 Boycott palm oil.  These companies are vile.

5439 2018-11-12 16:45:49 But i thought we only import refined oil
5440 2018-11-12 16:45:38 I saw the Growth Oil and was gonna get it. I’m definitely gonna go back and buy now. Chillleeee this shit smells like Frankincense and Myrrh!!  I felt like one of the wisemen on his way to see Baby Jesus.
5441 2018-11-12 16:45:38 Our President - our elections are crooked our intelligence depts don’t know anything, oil raising, goods are increasing, N Korea is building
5442 2018-11-12 16:45:33 I'm sure there is. Blew my mind when I found out beard oil existed.
5443 2018-11-12 16:45:23 Or just buy the little oil a small can for fuel and make some?
5444 2018-11-12 16:45:23 ถ้าวันไหนอยากเมาคือต้องเปิดเพลงของจีดี ไม่ก็มิโน
5445 2018-11-12 16:45:19 .. And Clearcast are bankrolled by HSBC who are heavily invested in palm oil...
5446 2018-11-12 16:45:16 American Companies can not even produce domestic oil for this price.
Why even explore if you can buy it at this price from land locked CANADIAN producers?

5448 2018-11-12 16:44:58 best advise I was ever given was by an old oil trader that came to CME to trade NQ on the floor. When I think it’s going higher-get long. If I think lower-get short. When I am right let em go and add when wrong get out. Took me a long time to realize what he really meant. #EMO

5450 2018-11-12 16:44:56 The Saudis announced last night their cutting oil production 50% and North Korea news is probably more likely. 

Also with today being a national holiday
5451 2018-11-12 16:44:54 Sunscreen, micellar water @ oil cleanser guna tak? If yes, brand apa?
5452 2018-11-12 16:44:47 Tesla was having the same issues awhile ago. Often times it's the manufacturer not providing the proper parts to oil change places forcing people to go to dealer
5453 2018-11-12 16:44:41 It's nothing to do with any vegetarian or vegan bandwagon. Palm oil is in loads of foods and toiletries.  It's about protecting the orangutans, what bandwagon would that be?
5454 2018-11-12 16:44:41 Definitely. Tea tree oil & peppermint oil are my favs.
5455 2018-11-12 16:44:37 they're not banning palm oil, nor calling for it to be banned
they're calling for it to be farmed responsibly, without senselessly destroying habitats and lives of animals for it
5456 2018-11-12 16:44:34 There's a little of this going on already too. Midland, TX is becoming a booming city due to oil and engineering work there. It's going to be an interesting test case.
5457 2018-11-12 16:44:24 Folks are switching off the hurricane lamps and going to bed early bro. Huko kwetu standard 8 kids were raising funds to burn the midnight oil. It is real kaka. Let's give it time
5458 2018-11-12 16:44:15 i wonder how much the Oilers leaders look at social media as a gauge of how crazy their fans are?  i get we are not experts but we all can't be wrong and the only ones noticing this isn't working.  still need a good dman and wingers that are nhl ready and can produce.
5459 2018-11-12 16:44:06 People that regularly get scammed by auto mechanics are making fun of the woman for being silly while changing her oil.  

The joke is definitely still on y’all.
5460 2018-11-12 16:43:46 Keep on pumping that pollution into the atmosphere with doggy acceleration... Or go get a Tesla or other EV and enjoy the freedom from the oil barons, and have neck snapping acceleration with a million mile drivetrain, all without oil, radiators, water pumps, spark plugs and more
5461 2018-11-12 16:43:44 Yup just one bolt, one socket, one ratchet and and oil filter wrench and the oil and oil filter
5462 2018-11-12 16:43:42 There is a case to be made that current data ownership rights are kind of like if the oil company could come in, drill next to your home and remove the minerals under it without your approval or consultation. Clearly a challenge for the modern data driven economy.
5463 2018-11-12 16:43:40 If only so called big oil companies were anti carbon tax

5467 2018-11-12 16:43:20 Baby oil is made from babies.
5468 2018-11-12 16:43:07 It turned out nicely. I recently started using Taliah Waajid’s Growth Oil and I really enjoy it, gonna try that leave-in next. 

How was the smell?
5469 2018-11-12 16:42:57 Females shouldn’t have to get their own oil changes and stuff like wtf 
5470 2018-11-12 16:42:47 Fossil fuels account approx 10% of  GDP Canadians subsidize oil and gas industry with $3,300,000,000 in subsidies so yeah we don’t largely depend on it they depend on us are you a paid operative to ff industry tho?

5472 2018-11-12 16:42:29 heh, yeah. the takedown is perhaps step one on this journey? all these dudes -- so many of them are dudes -- are just modern snake oil salesmen, aren't they?
5473 2018-11-12 16:42:25 they're not boycotting palm oil, they're boycotting how it is farmed, how it causes deforestation
they say they're removing it from their products until it causes no deforestation
they're not saying "don't use it at all" they're saying they want it farmed in a less harmful way
5474 2018-11-12 16:42:12 This.
After I did my first oil change myself I wondered why people waste money getting other people to do it. Easy peasy
5475 2018-11-12 16:42:07 Beard looks perfect for catching diff oil.
5476 2018-11-12 16:42:07 I have stopped buying Palm Oil products after seeing that video of The Orangutang trying to stop the truck from tearing down the last tree of its land, distressing to see but no doubt nowt happened to the bastards who did it. Hate them with such passion!
5477 2018-11-12 16:42:05 She missed the part about using certified palm oil products to ensure we are not contributing to habitat destruction. I disagree that we should not focus on single issue battles. The gov't of China just decided to hold off on allowing rhino horn to be used as medicine. A single
5478 2018-11-12 16:41:56 im at a tire shop by myself doing my first oil change, this is a big moment for me
5479 2018-11-12 16:41:54 We don't "pay". We send troops and weapons to defend our interests. Go ahead and withdraw from NATO. Then oil won't be valued by the dollar anymore. It will be valued under another currency and the dollar will be as worthless as a peso. Your an idiot Cadet Bone Spur.
5480 2018-11-12 16:41:39 Of course, don't purchase palm oil or products with palm oil.  and share to make others more aware.
5481 2018-11-12 16:41:26 يليت أدز لي هالماده من قانون النقابه والزماله والتعويض من اشتراكات النقابه والا صندوق الزماله واللي مشترك بالنقابه ومو مشترك بالزماله شنو وضعه بالتعويض وشنو ال آليه اللي بتستخدمها النقابه لتحديد المتضرر الفعلي
5482 2018-11-12 16:41:18 It's a shame that the powers to be, have not ended our dependence on oil.  What a sham.
5483 2018-11-12 16:41:18 Very true, otherwise manufacturers will just swap palm oil for something else with similar consequences
5484 2018-11-12 16:41:11 Everyone's such an environmentalist after the Iceland ad got blocked. Until of course, they need that one thing that comes in a plastic bottle or that thing that contains palm oil, or that thing that's imported, or that steak... I'm just as big of a hypocrite too tho...
5485 2018-11-12 16:40:52 This is one truth that is slowly spreading to the sick; a friend realised this just after surgeons cut a piece of his brain out; now he gets THC oil from Amsterdam; no more barbaric mercenary surgery for him. If only war crime truths could reach us.
5486 2018-11-12 16:40:50 All the stuff costs about the amount to get the oil changed

5494 2018-11-12 16:40:10 Genuine question, would we trade some of our oil for Indy?
5495 2018-11-12 16:40:08 God wil bless u sir. I moan today as an 8months old child was dumped in2 hot oil by French terrorist military

5501 2018-11-12 16:39:32 Well, part of the reason is the lines they faced are arguably better as units of three and their D actually helps them, unlike the Oilers. Second, he's probably tired from playing a ton & wouldn't be surprised if he's sick. Not a good combo when you're carrying the load nightly.
5502 2018-11-12 16:39:27 Today the stocks markets are big selling off by the rich people to embarrassing the President Trump and is a good time for the Americans to buy it, because the oil is low and President is cutting taxes the people will have more money to spend.

5507 2018-11-12 16:38:53 After eating a really disgusting cottage pie from Iceland years ago, just as the horsemeat scandal hit. I vowed never to buy anything from Iceland. With the No Bull range and the palm oil promise that's changed. What a turn around.

5510 2018-11-12 16:38:31 don't you mean the greenpeace palm oil advert
5511 2018-11-12 16:38:26 Just used palm oil to fry my eggs. Not bad actually
5512 2018-11-12 16:38:24 Ironic but people with the best hair usually have skin problems bc of excess oil. Make sure you’re using oil free products I highly suggest Neutrogena oil free rapid clear wash and An acne spot gel with 10% benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.
5513 2018-11-12 16:38:21 everyone’s complaining about the snow but the band kids had to walk in JUST our uniforms (no hoodies, jackets, sweats, nothin) all the way from the convention center to the back of lucas oil stadium in 17 degree weather 
5514 2018-11-12 16:38:19 Sandra has a friend on Facebook who sells CBD oil that I’ve seen a ton of people recommended. Might be worth looking into it!
5515 2018-11-12 16:38:12 We did this a couple weekends ago. Found a pretty simple recipe on google and they turned out great.

After you shred them place them in a hot pan with a bit of oil to make one side crispy. Also have some hot sauce on stand by if you’re into that. *kisses fingers*
5516 2018-11-12 16:38:06 Yes, it's HSBC - they have millions tied up in palm oil
5517 2018-11-12 16:38:04 It’s hemp oil w/o THC. Use it for any type of inflammation and medical personnel are even using it to treat kids with seizures, epilepsy, etc. I hace friends who have used it when weaning off of antidepressants. Stabilizes and reduces aches/pains. I’m a fan!
5518 2018-11-12 16:37:58 Conservatism is basically the belief that there is a massive conspiracy put forth by a majority of the world's journalists, historians, doctors, scientists and teachers that can only be thwarted by a few plucky oil barons, corporate lobbyists and their billionaire allies.

5520 2018-11-12 16:37:50 the beard-union is upon us, I must prepare the sacred goblet of scented beard oil.
5521 2018-11-12 16:37:48 I just use white vinegar with some essential oil.
5522 2018-11-12 16:37:46 You have been working on the oil rigs don’t lie to me
5523 2018-11-12 16:37:41 Much was alleged by modi shsh Ramdev on lakhs of crore foreign black money. We all relied and voted. On SC directive SIT was formed but why silent for 4yrs? Where gone all money? Enough lies on oil bond, FYI less then 4000cr of oil bond dues are paid in 4yrs.
5524 2018-11-12 16:37:27 Aren't cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, oil seed rape and a few others all genetically-modified from _Brassica sativa_ ? Makes no difference that they were done the slow way.
5525 2018-11-12 16:37:12 This explains why there Chocolate tastes like VEGETABLE OIL. Being as Cadbury's is now in Poland and it's government yesterday openly marched with Fascist; we are know boycotting Cadbury products.
5526 2018-11-12 16:36:54 $XLE and anything oil can't get it's shit together even with all that OPEC talk over the weekend .. scary
5527 2018-11-12 16:36:51 No problem! Co washing is big for girls with textured hair here and we’ve been fed the myth that not washing hair makes it greasy when it’s the opposite! Over washing makes it produce more oil.
5528 2018-11-12 16:36:48 Eat well. Eat sardines for shiny hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to controls hair loss. Give or take. How do I discover the legitimate source. Gentle to hair. It's all natural.

5530 2018-11-12 16:36:38 We reported on this not too long ago! First it was an oil boom, now its missile sales that are the have become adverse effects of Western sanctions against #Russia
5531 2018-11-12 16:36:30 Could you imagine, the masses would lose their minds, lol. The thing that kills me w/ the old boys club angle so may love to go on about, is many teams do it & in all kinds of sports. No question, Oilers went overboard in the past but at the moment, I don't see it as a big deal.
5532 2018-11-12 16:36:21 Bit different when it’s money earnt by the club compared to a camel shaggers oil money, but on a whole their recruitment has been miles better whether they’ve spent more or not
5533 2018-11-12 16:36:20 I find that tea tree oil is great for drying out lumps and bumps.
5534 2018-11-12 16:36:10 Financial Fair Play, Fernandinho’s fouls, Abu Dhabi oil money, Peps bald, empty seats... opposition, media and even some of the managers have an excuse for everything
5535 2018-11-12 16:36:08 Dear “Dr” Stewart. Greenpeace doesn’t appear to understand it enables oil use, not suppresses it.
Preventing Canadian oil exports decreases its price.
Making a portion of oil production less expensive makes all oil less expensive, and thus more affordable for all.
#cdnpoli #oil
5536 2018-11-12 16:35:58 to go to the gym or go get my oil changed 
5537 2018-11-12 16:35:53 pipeline blocking issue, its plummeting price is reasonable. However, shouldn’t Russia be happy about the rising oil price and increase its production? Why Russia plan to cut its oil production in 2019?
5538 2018-11-12 16:35:51 Energy is now going to be volatile. Energy services are selling off. This will kill new production for winter 2018/19 because capex for oil is getting slashed. The low for energy services will be Nov 24/Dec 24 a.k.a Tax Loss season Then weather slams usa for cold snap and Ngas +%
5539 2018-11-12 16:35:50 Come for a $40 oil change end up spending $125 cause they recommend this and that ect lol. And my ass just , like iight cool  lol
5540 2018-11-12 16:35:48 •Question：if Irian is suffered from U.S. unilateral sanction while the need for crude oil stays as usual, then the need from other large oil producing countries, such as Canada and Russia should be boosted and the oil price should be higher. Since Canada is suffering from
5541 2018-11-12 16:35:42 @kaysomuah, to clarify, is your tweet in response to ours? If you have any questions, I am happy to correct any misinformation about the certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our soaps. -Stacey

5543 2018-11-12 16:35:01 This oil change was much needed 
My inspection out this month I'm doing it on the last day 
5544 2018-11-12 16:34:59 This is folly. No petitions are needed. Take matters into your own hands. @iceland @icelandairwaves @IcelandNatural @palmoil @PalmOilFarmer @PalmOilProject @katrinjak Don't purchase palm oil products or products with palm oil @Nestle @kitkat_ph #additive
5545 2018-11-12 16:34:52 BRB gonna build a frozen turkey rocket using hot oil as a propellant.
5546 2018-11-12 16:34:42 Shows you know nothing it’s all about the oil
5547 2018-11-12 16:34:39 I barely know how to change a tire and women out here changing their oil... I'm scared of y'all.
5548 2018-11-12 16:34:27 Wanted to get one thing done today, get the oil changed in my car, and the lines are hours long 
5549 2018-11-12 16:34:23 That’s pretty much what they do-make a lot of vegan dishes and still have meat when they want it. They started with a one month vegan diet and felt it wasn’t permanently sustainable for them but enjoyable to add in to their lifestyle. 
That sucks about flaxseed oil! Ouch!
5550 2018-11-12 16:34:20 It's about oil.

Brilliant advert that needs to be shared. 
Please read labels and boycott palm oil.

5559 2018-11-12 16:33:33 There can be no justification for setting fires to rainforests. Cut down the fat not the forests. Rapeseed, Sunflower or olive oil produced in UK, France, Italy is not the cause of those fires.

5562 2018-11-12 16:33:04 no, today's sell off is b/c Saudi Arabia & Russia are talking about cutting oil production. dude, don't you have ADVISORS?  #ALTERNATIVEFACTS

5567 2018-11-12 16:32:36 Those Californian fire tenders which helped save so many lives and prevented $millions property damage - they were ALL fossil fuelled.

Shocking, isn't it?

Will you continue to campaign to 'make oil history'?
5568 2018-11-12 16:32:33 Kim said it before I could. Investing is 100% reallocating the wealth created by the labor of others. It's taking the profits from my labor in a service job (systems administration) and using it to fund oil companies' destruction of our only home in the universe.
5569 2018-11-12 16:32:32 Is a female changing her own oil really the standard? I’m not doing that. and it has nothing to do with the fact that I couldn’t learn. I just don’t want to. As long as I get maintenance on my car properly and you not paying for it. Get out my face.
5570 2018-11-12 16:32:29 But Eni was rewarded for its loyalty in 2007 when it entered into a massive 10-year $28 billion investment deal with Libya.

5573 2018-11-12 16:32:22 No, that is caused by the destabilization of oil since the U.S. is producing so much, also higher dollar and global economic crisis sitting on the brink. U.S. debt is outrageous
5574 2018-11-12 16:32:21 cadbury’s 3rd ingredient is palm oil tho so i refuse to eat it...

5578 2018-11-12 16:31:54 Veganism is fine I guess if you can afford the supplements  I process flaxseed oil as estrogen & it gives me meltdowns, and it’s expensive. I never could sustain pure veganism- but I raise my own happy chickens so I feel ok about it. 

I eat a lot of vegan dishes, though.

5594 2018-11-12 16:30:15 Don’t forget that productivity will be less and our oil industry will suffer and you smug face will still have your pension paid for by us.

5600 2018-11-12 16:29:09 My doc just told me that I’m supposed to keep fish oil pills in the fridge (up to 30 days; freeze the rest). Apparently, I’ve been ingesting rancid fish oil on the daily... for years. 
5601 2018-11-12 16:29:06 That's like saying the price of gas is going down because of the Dems? Or is it that Saudi Arabia is pumping out some cheap oil to avoid having the United States investigate Khashoggi's murder further?
5602 2018-11-12 16:29:00 See the fine face you're using to lie after you've finished eating @adyvafoods and allowing the oil to drip on your cloth and you now telling me its breast milk pssshh girl pls find another lie.

5606 2018-11-12 16:28:43 Agree it should be shared ... palm oil is everywhere and people just don’t check labels enough ... biscuits, cosmetics, nut butters etc etc

5610 2018-11-12 16:28:17 Polyurethane is a byproduct of crude, BASF use it to make soles for adidas boost running shoes.
BASF is already in Nigeria, deregulating the oil and gas industry would ensure their expansion beyond their current focus area = higher paying jobs.

5630 2018-11-12 16:25:30 I feel it wants to fill the second gap at 2682 before any reversal and it may even shoot further down to re-test previous lows as most traders are expecting, who knows? Crashing oil prices and death cross among some large big CAP Stocks is a sign for more slide down

5642 2018-11-12 16:24:22 I know. Imagine being told that deforestation caused by the relentless pursuit of palm oil production is threatening not just Orangutans, but also the future of civilisation, and that you can help prevent it by using shampoo that doesn't contain palm oil.
It's so unfair on him.

5644 2018-11-12 16:24:16 We went too far too fast during the oil boom ten years ago. Now there's not enough money to go around. Gosh Islander RV was booming 10 years ago, and look at that place now. And that's only the start of it according to some guys that I talk to.
5645 2018-11-12 16:24:12 17. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,18. so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
5646 2018-11-12 16:24:04 I join the effort in not buying any products with palm oil in them. This is another story of powerful companies hiding the effects of their business operations.

5673 2018-11-12 16:21:15 Government already overtaxes oil and gasoline to a point of insanity. the government makes more money from petroleum products than the oil companies, the refineries and everyone else in the chain. Maybe they feel a tiny bit of shame? Naw!

5808 2018-11-12 16:07:34 Everyone and their mother decided today was an oil change day
5809 2018-11-12 16:07:30 This coming from the biggest thief on the planet!!  Keep selling that snake oil to your ill informed cult!!!
5810 2018-11-12 16:07:21 Interesting talk. I think he underestimates the improvement in oil recovery technologies, the permanent triple digit oil prices are farther out than he projects.
5811 2018-11-12 16:07:19 So killing of animals by taking their habitat away from them is ok?..no! we should be making our children see what corporate greed is doing to our world..this advert was about palm oil.. maybe you want your kids to grow up with no wildlife but rest of us do.. it's very relevant
5812 2018-11-12 16:07:10 Body Shop almond milk and honey body butter. It helped me get rid of scales on my ankles and legs. Also Now Foods Sweet almond oil for face and body.
5813 2018-11-12 16:07:08 Running it before you change it to get the oil hot. It’s not running when you drain it.

5816 2018-11-12 16:06:53 @PalmersUK I've looked on #RSPO website&found E.T. Browne Drug Co. but can't see any reports filed. Being a member of RSPO doesn't mean all your palm oil is certified. Can u confirm how much of your #palmoil is certified&how much is physically sustainable &how much is book&claim?
5817 2018-11-12 16:06:39 If Saudi Arabia needs to cut oil production due to a growing glut, why do 8 countries need waivers from the USA to avoid Iran Oil Sanctions?????

5820 2018-11-12 16:06:33 The use carrier oils that don’t have a smell or fragrance oil and the rest is the actual oil. Essential oils are very potent so when smelling them you’ll definitely smell the oil but if you have a real oil and a fake one you can tell the difference
5821 2018-11-12 16:06:33 同じですよ
5822 2018-11-12 16:06:27 Really? Someone would actually read her book?
5823 2018-11-12 16:06:18 This government has diversified our revenue to not be reliant on oil, which makes it much more sustainable.This government has grown the economy to be the strongest in the country and this government is actually predicting less debt than they thought due to their Strong economy
5824 2018-11-12 16:06:17 Or get a juul cart with oil in it!
5825 2018-11-12 16:06:15 Most palm oil (found in around 50% of most household products) is sourced from Rainforests where they cut down and burn large amounts of it to grow it obvs causing intense deforestation n killing wildlife
5826 2018-11-12 16:06:14 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 12 November @ 18:00

5840 2018-11-12 16:04:40 If you understood the market you would know that it's bond prices and the downturn in China due to tarrifs that is causing the recent slowdown with do days big issue being SA oil production decrease.

The only political issue is uncertainty cause by Trump's ineptness.

5842 2018-11-12 16:04:22 Exactly when do the "feds step in" for rural areas? When they give them farm subsidies and oil subsidies? Rural areas should have more of a beef with big banks in cities than big government.

5848 2018-11-12 16:03:13 Yes we have.  We have over supplied the market with oil sitting in tankers on land and on sea. We have bottle necked pipe lines in Texas all this with Iran sanctions. Need USA restrictions to reduce out put and increase oil prices.
5849 2018-11-12 16:03:12 Fake and overpriced. If you look at their bottles most of them are from India. Huge red flag. Also the parts used aren’t correct and they’re therapeutic grade. Their Lavender oil isn’t from India though. This is a marketing strategy companies use to

5861 2018-11-12 16:02:07 Plz explain, why can't a water tower or sprinkler system be built. Usage of swimming pool water or a strategically placed water tower that can be tapped when needed. There's a pipeline for oil, why not water? It's not rocket science. #WTH

5880 2018-11-12 15:59:52 Oil field money where’s it’s at
5881 2018-11-12 15:59:51 Exactly. Coconut oil was similarly praised as a cure-all not long ago. Sure there are benefits but it isn’t a magic elixir. Developing a dog’s impulse control for crate training and reactivity are far more productive.
5882 2018-11-12 15:59:49 “Sis” has me rolling

5888 2018-11-12 15:59:26 I really care. Saudis rammed the towers/we went to Iraq. Now we have an Embassy there larger than Vatican City. Now..Rosneft and Gazprom have oil license there.
5889 2018-11-12 15:59:08 Just can't see how Fracking in the UK is going to be profitable'when it's barely profitable in the USA.'and won't be if the Saudi's reduce Oil prices by 20p a barrel.
5890 2018-11-12 15:59:06 Probably not, actually, especially if it actually causes oil & gas employment to bounce back again since the hit it took ca 2015-2017 from high supply and low prices.

5892 2018-11-12 15:58:59 Every Socialist country I can think of with a "good" economy relied on oil way too much and then paid the inevitable price for doing so.
5893 2018-11-12 15:58:59 Agreed! It feels that they’re purposely trying to deceive consumers. For whatever reason at least put the layman’s term in brackets - like (palm oil)

5904 2018-11-12 15:57:28 OPEC is moving closer to a production cut. The cartel is likely to agree to an oil production cut when it meets next month in Vienna as oil prices enter bear market territory and signs of oversupply loom. #traders #algotraders

5934 2018-11-12 15:54:59 Our lecturing society has done a lot of good in what's morally right... rights for women,  equal marriage just because he agrees with the use of palm oil he doesn't agree with the lecture.
5935 2018-11-12 15:54:52 wow thank god i opened my eyes to palm oil, luckily i don't actually use much in my diet n the stuff i use seems to be palm oil free, but time to make it fully palm oil free ! see u later oreos kettle crisps n pepsi :(
5936 2018-11-12 15:54:31 Looks like Obama wants a barrel of oil to go to $300 so his friends the Iranian will make up for sanctions imposed by big bad @realDonaldTrump.  Leave Yemen alone so they can occupy Saudia Arabia and raise the Iranian flag over Riad.

5940 2018-11-12 15:54:16 Heating oil prices moving slightly higher today at 10:49 AM Eastern standard time. 218.46 that’s an increase of +1.18 a percentage gain of +0.45%.
5941 2018-11-12 15:54:05 Just another flawed human trying to get this shit right
5942 2018-11-12 15:54:04 We regular citizens aren't especially greedy, but we're too ignorant about allowing our emotions to be fed and led by rich oil oligarchs, etc.  Realize where the charge is being led from.  Listen, judge and don't be part of a mob.
5943 2018-11-12 15:54:02 Hi Stuart. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

5946 2018-11-12 15:53:51 More like oil...nice try though..
5947 2018-11-12 15:53:47 That’s literally what I said. Bitumen requires more processing to use than oil from other parts of the world
5948 2018-11-12 15:53:47 First “dip” isn’t with oil. U boil them very gently in salted water then let them cool, and then dry out in the fridge or even the  freezer. It’s how you get the real crunchy bits - as the outside starts to break down when u boil them

5950 2018-11-12 15:53:39 @JustinTrudeau ban Saudi oil. Oh wait, we need it because we can't get our pipelines built. Also, is Saudi Arabia subject to your carbon tax? #onestepforwardtwostepsback
5951 2018-11-12 15:53:39 Don't scratch it, apply any oil or vaseline to it
5952 2018-11-12 15:53:37 @AberdeenCC won’t do a thing about it same as junction with Denmore Rd. HGV’s serving oil, gas & subsea companies in the industrial estate were having to mount the pavement to turn into this street. So the council installed bollards now forcing HGV’s into lane of oncoming traffic
5953 2018-11-12 15:53:36 To be clear, a big portion of Canada oil profits is regulated to GHG reduction and renewables.  The USA, Russia, and the mid east tend focus oil profits on technologies that double tap a hospital full of innocents with smart bombs.  Envirobeanies tend to ignore the real world.

5957 2018-11-12 15:53:22 I researched that I could go 7500 miles without an oil change and did that for 4 months. Niggas was like you need a flush because you've gone so long without one

5965 2018-11-12 15:52:19 Oil prices are a big cause of today’s drop.  There have been bigger drops pre-election, btw.  Thanks for playing.
5966 2018-11-12 15:51:53 Make Example of few who spread fake News. This is like adding oil to a fire when you already got willing individuals trying to burn country down.
5967 2018-11-12 15:51:42 You have a sever lacking in your understanding supply and demand. Oil is globally priced.
5968 2018-11-12 15:51:36 Even the oil was cheap in the whole world, claims of 45 rupees per liters made oil expensive by PTI
But Four times the price of petroleum products increased in the last twoeen months
5969 2018-11-12 15:51:35 No problem!! I’ve also found putting lemon essential oil on break outs helps clear them up if you have any. 
5970 2018-11-12 15:51:31 Yes, sadly and embarassingly so.  :(  

I was angry President Obama did not send troops to rescue the Yazidi women, but did he send to rescue and help suffering in Africa?  Suffering is suffering.  We can do better. 

Lots of noise now about human rights abuses Iran....  *OIL*.

5973 2018-11-12 15:51:19 I struggle with knowing what palm oil is known as within brands because it seems to go under so many different names
5974 2018-11-12 15:51:13 Feeling extra anxious today and I ran out of my CBD oil  who has 10 drops for me? 
5975 2018-11-12 15:51:03 He is a consummate snake oil salesman.
5976 2018-11-12 15:50:59 And cadbury's chocolate is full of palm oil.
5977 2018-11-12 15:50:52 @frozen_oil お誕生日おめでとうございます
これからも一緒にオイル集めましょう！！
5978 2018-11-12 15:50:46 The country's major oil companies have been speeding up drilling and exploration from major tight and shale oil and gas formations in the country's western regions recently to boost domestic output.
5979 2018-11-12 15:50:42 Thanks Mike what sort of gas prices could they get? Perhaps it’s more about tight oil....
5980 2018-11-12 15:50:40 いろいろしてたらこんな時間　片付けないと
5981 2018-11-12 15:50:38 ...says the self-serving ass, as US oil prices tumble downward.

5984 2018-11-12 15:50:11 Just wait SA is threatening to cut oil production AGAIN which means, even though the US produces plenty of domestic oil, prices are getting ready to skyrocket
5985 2018-11-12 15:50:11 Walmart is the cheapest oil change. Debating if the savings is worth the wait...

5987 2018-11-12 15:50:03 i look like one of those substitute teachers that’s like crazy and a hippie and does essential oil shit during my free time
5988 2018-11-12 15:49:49 I have a Cunning Plan: all MPs and Peers should be forced to carry and have visible a small bottle labelled ‘Snake Oil’.
5989 2018-11-12 15:49:49 Military women, I know you haven’t changed ya oil in almost a year.

@jiffylube and @meinekecarcare got free oil changes for Veterans Day
5990 2018-11-12 15:49:49 NO!  Once again you're wrong!  Market crashing due to Oil in The Middle East. Your sanctions could reduce daily production significantly! #StopScaringPeople

6001 2018-11-12 15:49:01 The oil exploration industry begged the government to regulate them in the 30’s. An industry can not survive without regulation, otherwise it’s the wild Wild West, markets don’t like the uncertainty.
6002 2018-11-12 15:48:58 Can beat Bonchan, Oil King, Tokido, Smug, Nemo & Daigo but lose to Fujimura?

lol more like FREE-U! Amirite? 
6003 2018-11-12 15:48:55 OPEC can’t influence oil prices.  A Democratic ran USA (president, house, and senate) is the only way to reduce Oil supply. Increase regulations will reduce drilling and output reducing global supply. @FoxBusiness
6004 2018-11-12 15:48:53 so one of my uncles owns some gas stations righ and this morning one of the (i think newer and bigger) trucks with oil being transported exploded on the road jfc
6005 2018-11-12 15:48:52 It’s partly our faults too. We don’t turn oil changes into our car insurance, so why do we turn checkups, and other office visits into health insurance?

6024 2018-11-12 15:47:14 also, check that detergents you purchase are RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) and BCorp certified as well.

6026 2018-11-12 15:47:09 Episiotomies don't lower your changes of spontaneous tears during delivery-guided delivery does (counter pressure on your perineum, warm compresses + mineral oil massages before and during labor). As a birth doula, those practices haven't failed my clients yet.
6027 2018-11-12 15:47:04 Would top oil industries decision-makers consider the investment for clean air as a nonprofit, charity fund so as not to think of   this as a cost of operation but as charitable nonprofit action, would that help decision makers to upgrade their factories for cleaner air output?

6031 2018-11-12 15:46:43 Water. If you have vitamins, take em. Cook something nice for yourself but minimize usage of potentially fatty ingredients(use less oil, etc.). What I do is eat 3 lite meals or 1/2 big meals a day. Juice/tea is fine too. Passive exercise or stretching is good.

6035 2018-11-12 15:46:36 The no.1 most cruel and inhumane in the world is the US military complex. Launching baseless wars. Destroying countries for oil, opioids and greed.

6041 2018-11-12 15:45:56 Palm oil is something very specific. It’s not good and it’s everywhere. Greedy corporations are to blame.
6042 2018-11-12 15:45:55 My god we just cancel their fake fiat currency. Bring back gold and silver. Stock market probably needs to die. They control everything with FED and Market. Oil needs removed from Market. I know everyone thinks Markets wonderful. I disagree. Tools of the enemy.
6043 2018-11-12 15:45:51 Clove oil really helped me with this toothache because I was really going to die.
6044 2018-11-12 15:45:41 Acb needs to turn all there left over dry bud into oil! The oils the only thing selling out and your getting 3x profits start stocking more oils. #acb @Aurora_MMJ
6045 2018-11-12 15:45:37  Answer me this. Are people "non-compliant" with changing the oil in their car or the filters on their HVAC systems? Does this behavior cause "illness" of their home or car? Could it be prevented? #medtwitter #hcldr

6062 2018-11-12 15:44:23 U.S. stock futures were mixed this morning as benchmark American oil prices snap a 10-session losing streak. Despite sliding Friday, Wall Street still posted positive weekly gains. The Dow saw its best week March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw their second straight positive week.
6063 2018-11-12 15:44:21 only two types of outfits; muumuus and large sweatshirts with sweatpants.  Her double chin sported tons of errant hairs and her greasy light brown skin left oil marks wherever she went. She always wore flip-flops no matter what the season and never cared to get a pedicure to make
6064 2018-11-12 15:44:20 Also. Capitalists do that all the time. Refusing to hire trans people cause they are trans. Foreclosing on someone’s house that they’ve lived in for 20 years just cause they missed a payment or two. Taking indigenous Amazonian peoples land for oil. Spilling oil in the gulf.
6065 2018-11-12 15:44:01 I think that might be oil prices Einstein!
6066 2018-11-12 15:44:00 You can just see the guy coming up behind him is about to shout “ITS ALL OIL MONEY MATE”
6067 2018-11-12 15:43:44 Maybe you should talk to your buddies in Saudi Arabia about oil exports instead of baseless assertions against the majority of Americans and their representatives
6068 2018-11-12 15:43:41 I think everyone should email the advertisers and thank them for the paper let them.know what it's been used for cat litter liner oil soaker etc not buy anything from them maybe when their inbox is full they'll know how we all feel lol
6069 2018-11-12 15:43:38 No, it's because when Carter told us to put on a sweater while we figure out how to switch away from oil, Reagan was elected.  Politicians have never asked Americans to make any sacrifices since then. See also two wars we didn't pay for, and Trump promising to save coal.
6070 2018-11-12 15:43:36 Oil journalist karaoke...
6071 2018-11-12 15:43:23 @tconspiracyguys just listened to the peak oil episode (trying to catch up lol) and it was brilliant. Do you think they will witch to renewable energy once they have privatised water, sun and wind as a resource?
6072 2018-11-12 15:43:09 Why it’s always something else wrong with your car when you go to get an oil change lmao

6076 2018-11-12 15:43:00 Whose fault? #Trump ‘s fault!!  Trade, deficit in the trillions, and #GOP got a shellacking in the mid terms, oil, your erratic decisions re Middle East & acting like a baby when it rained in France... yeah sure that has nothing to do with the stock market!! #TakeRedponsibility!

6078 2018-11-12 15:42:58 I wasn’t seeing any rapid growth with castor oil but at least I see the thickness
6079 2018-11-12 15:42:56 lol, palm oil, smh we malaysian the biggest palm oil producer and we have the biggest sanctuary of orang utan in the world. another case of caucasian saying shits they dont even know. try compare palm oil quality and all yall white oil smh. narketing at its best.
6080 2018-11-12 15:42:54 55555 ฮรือตีรัวๆเลยย หนูก็สั่งไปเยอะะ รอน้องด้วยย
6081 2018-11-12 15:42:53 Come on now....it's the ongoing trade issues with China, fires in California, Oil etc. That you finally have oversight by the House helped the market bounce after the election.  It's not always about you.
6082 2018-11-12 15:42:53 So somehow the decline and future decline in Apple iPhone sales in China is related to the Dems taking the house? That's what's leading the drop in the Dow today along with higher oil prices.
6083 2018-11-12 15:42:49 Meanwhile Merkel just made a deal to purchase oil from Putin and had to be stopped by Trump from going through with it.
6084 2018-11-12 15:42:49 Pre revenue oil play with £840M Mcap
I thought it looked toppy IMO
6085 2018-11-12 15:42:40 Lol! Instability of the market begins and ends with @realDonaldTrump. Tax policy that creates a huge Federal deficit and increases Federal debt, no stability in health insurance because you want to gut Obamacare, and then you create instability in the oil/gas markets...it is YOU!
6086 2018-11-12 15:42:40 Caught selling? You do know that Rupert Murdoch owns quite a few oil Wells? And that he also owns Fox news? Look at the Washington Post. It's owned by Jeff Bezos and is practically his mouth piece. Saudi Royalty owns a part of NY times.
6087 2018-11-12 15:42:39 Partially correct but not d complete story! I am sure you know that was as a result of d drop in oil prices, lack of a diverse economy, absence of fiscal buffers, and wanton waste of public funds during 16 years of PDP rule!! Stay blessed
6088 2018-11-12 15:42:36 Holding USD isn't as much of an option as much as it is a requirement. Commodities are mostly expressed and (more importantly) transactions settled in dollars. If you're Peru and want to buy oil from Brazil, you still need USD to settle the transaction.
6089 2018-11-12 15:42:32 Layan lagu oil and gas jap. OAG
6090 2018-11-12 15:42:26 Winners write the history. Giving Bush an honor for sending troops into the incorrect country, killings hundreds of thousands including innocent people and torturing others in the name of oil profits to get rid of a dictator daddy installed.
6091 2018-11-12 15:42:17 Kawawa samin chilli oil eh Hahaha
6092 2018-11-12 15:42:13 I hate when I take my car in for service and they try to sell me a whole new car. 

"What if we can get you a better interest rate?"

Word? Y'all can get me better than 0%? Cuz I bought this joint in cash, now change this oil n lemme lone.
6093 2018-11-12 15:42:08 Trudeau's secret agenda coming out into the open.
He never campaigned on this issue, neither did he campaign on destroying our oil industry.
6094 2018-11-12 15:42:06 And the fact that it is snowing in Antartica means the price of crude oil will fall more. Your uneducated statements get loonier and loonier
6095 2018-11-12 15:41:55 Mexican olive oil. Tell me, what is the value of that trade and the tariff rates?
6096 2018-11-12 15:41:50 Oil isn't all about fossil fuels.
Try and think about stuff outside the narrow propaganda put out by interested parties.
6097 2018-11-12 15:41:34 (At work)
Me: Salut! I think I found oil. 
Construction worker: Do you always look like this? 
Me: Ok, I guess! 
Ikea Employee: I said OK!

6098 2018-11-12 15:41:28 Oil is commodity they would pump more of, as the World needs less of it.

6100 2018-11-12 15:41:19 Because Canada has no need for Saudi oil. The perks of being truly independent.

6106 2018-11-12 15:40:59 Iranians are selling more oil now.
6107 2018-11-12 15:40:52 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
6108 2018-11-12 15:40:52 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6109 2018-11-12 15:40:45 No it is not caused by the Dems. It is because of Saudi cutting oil production and the 23 billion of stocks Soft Bank is selling off. Tell the truth
6110 2018-11-12 15:40:44 Texas and other producing states should start voting democrat if they want higher oil prices.  Until then enjoy low oil prices.   @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @cvpayne
6111 2018-11-12 15:40:39 Orange oil mixed in water 2 oz/gallon works great. Pour it onto the mound and soak completely. Fire ants will be  gone by morning
6112 2018-11-12 15:40:38 according to the torygraph the oil money is enough to bail out 66m in uk but not the 5M in Scotland

6115 2018-11-12 15:40:25 I bought a big one and it's in the oven now! I swiped mine with olive oil and salt and pepper before putting the two halves in the oven upside down. How do you prepare yours?
6116 2018-11-12 15:40:25 I hate when I’m sitting somewhere by myself, minding my damn business and people just walk up to me and start talking to me. I’m getting my oil changed and this guy walks in and just starts talking to me. I picked up my book and started reading leave me alone bruh
6117 2018-11-12 15:40:10 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
6118 2018-11-12 15:39:55 I used to like him but his attitude towards the palm oil based advert was disgusting. This world is the one everyone’s children and grandchildren need to live in and we’re selfishly destroying it.
6119 2018-11-12 15:39:50 I bought a diffuser and it might be too early to say this, but it’s LIFECHANGING. I feel so zen and happy by it.  Lemongrass oil is really doing it for me rn. Yasss Lawd!
6120 2018-11-12 15:39:48 If you're talking about WWII vets, I agree that they fought for freedom and safety.  All wars fought after that were fought over oil, other countries' assets, dislike for other countries' leaders and global superiority over all others.
6121 2018-11-12 15:39:46 Fridays when his kids are gone and Orange Hairpiece tries to formulate a clear sentence, a sad wolf dreams about being a #Democrat

6123 2018-11-12 15:39:19 No DJT, the setting of the oil price by OPEC is causing the stock market to drop. Please stop the blame the Dems rhetoric, you are causing friends to turn on each other. Take it like a man, not like the 8 yr old you are

6126 2018-11-12 15:39:05 Looked up to see what products contain Palm Oil.  Good luck if you like to wash yourself, your clothes or you like to eat food.  It's in everything and has over 200 names so you can't even look for it in ingredients.  How do we even start?
6127 2018-11-12 15:39:02 Garnier biru sama yg oil brp?
6128 2018-11-12 15:38:59 뭔 개소리야
6129 2018-11-12 15:38:58 Actually the stock market problems are caused by your terrible tariffs, the deficit spike caused by your tax scam and your driving up oil prices because of your sanctions on Iran.
6130 2018-11-12 15:38:35 Water and oil
6131 2018-11-12 15:38:26 Never again will I let somebody else change my oil and rotate my tires.
6132 2018-11-12 15:38:15 I'm picturing the Oil Can scene with the Tin Man from Wizard of Oz and cannot stop giggling to myself
6133 2018-11-12 15:38:15 Crude oil won’t hit $100 until USA has a Democratic president, congress, and senate.  More regulations equal less output.  Until then enjoy lower gas prices.  @FoxBusiness @cvpayne
6134 2018-11-12 15:38:11 Hey #developer team leads/#managers - can anyone recommend some no-bs/no-snake-oil books, podcasts, other materials for team management? I'd very much appreciate it :)
6135 2018-11-12 15:38:06 The Dems started their duty of oversight since you were elected.  The stock market has no reason to react to this. They’re reacting to your mismanagement, tariffs, oil prices going up, clown performance in France and refusal to attend Asia conferences this week

6139 2018-11-12 15:37:41 Getting a tire fixed and an oil change. For some reason #700Club is playing on the TV.

Can someone please tell me what kind of God allows Malibu to burn but lets Pat Robertson live this long?

#patrobertson #MalibuFire #whyGod
6140 2018-11-12 15:37:40 I've heard that water is the new oil. Bush family bought huge waters in Paraguay & Royals are buying, also.
6141 2018-11-12 15:37:38 She soon start rubbing you down with holy oil as you walk out the door
6142 2018-11-12 15:37:32 Not sure but if it's backed by oil and oil is a fluctuating value commodity perhaps not. So far I believe most stable coins are backed or paired with fiat currencies. Haven't researched them much though.
6143 2018-11-12 15:37:28 No, it’s your friends the Saudis cutting back on oil output.
6144 2018-11-12 15:37:23 In my life
Oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I...tweet about oil...
6145 2018-11-12 15:37:17 Love how Iceland basically ran the most successful ad campaign and got so many people to advertise on their behalf. They might not like palm oil but I’m sure they are still bastards.
6146 2018-11-12 15:37:08 Ghee. 

And I love Peanut Oil for frying turkey but that's a whole other story.
6147 2018-11-12 15:37:00 Ok black coffee and weed should work....otherwise you might need the castor oil...
6148 2018-11-12 15:36:57 What you did to the Price & Reactionary Functions of the Price of Oil is the Reason.  
6149 2018-11-12 15:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
6150 2018-11-12 15:36:36 Moisturizer you might try a direct oil it does wonders
6151 2018-11-12 15:36:25 Luv to spend 3 hours waiting for an oil change on my day off.
6152 2018-11-12 15:36:25 Dragged myself out of bed and into the shower this morning, so I could go out and buy some weapons against this cough. Am now tucked back in bed with Vapo-Rub on my chest, camphor oil in the humidifier, and a warm drink 
6153 2018-11-12 15:36:19 Everyone needs to keep an eye on #oil. It recently entered a bear market, but @Mattbadialiguru is all over it. Look for oil to soar very soon.

He made an enquiry and gave clean chit unfortunately as expected 
I want your kind authority to look into this ongoing fraud at welcome motor IndiAn oil pump at Saket New Delhi
6157 2018-11-12 15:35:45 Hey, I know you're getting a lot of "Fox news! Of course hes sharing lies and bullshit" thrown at you right now

But I do have a legitimate question

Why is the RW talking points in defense of Saudi Arabia? Is it just the oil and the money? After all these years is it still that?
6158 2018-11-12 15:35:45 
6159 2018-11-12 15:35:38 Me: oooh I need to go buy wheat flour and coconut oil to make pumpkin bread
Mariah: ewww I don’t like pumpkin bread
Me: it’s not for you, it’s for Coheed 
Mariah: I bet they won’t like it either 

6160 2018-11-12 15:35:35 Need to do something about the falling oil prices. You talk greatly about the economy but let the oil prices fall further then watch the lay offs happen.

6182 2018-11-12 15:33:37 How about oil?
6183 2018-11-12 15:33:36 And who makes sure they have corrupt gov'ts? Again, look into economic Hitman. There was no way the We$t was going to tolerate Lamuba, but they were down with M'butu and then Paul Kagame.

Africa should be rich, where does the wealth from their gold and oil, etc go? Exxon, Shell

I was cheated last night at welcome motors Saket New Delhi 
I filled diesel worth 800 rupees but my car fuel gauge did show refuel as very less diesel filled up
6188 2018-11-12 15:33:04 Do you also oppose the massive subsidies given to the oil industry? Because the Republican right are the ones who continue to defend and protect those

6193 2018-11-12 15:32:25 Yet another completely ignorant statement. Besides the US, the only 'very rich countries' out there are Russia (oligarch money) and Saudi Arabia (oil money). 
One of these days, you should try dealing in FACTS.
6194 2018-11-12 15:32:25 Spotted Sand still on R. Don at Jarrow 1.45pm. Dirs to park at oil depot do work, but taking Church Bank and parking on Slake Rd better.

6196 2018-11-12 15:32:09 …could not sign because the Mediterranean olive growers will not agree.  Before you start the only benefits do not concern olive oil and baked beans. I’m sure trade negotiators could find more purely mutually beneficial changes we can make elsewhere around the globe…
6197 2018-11-12 15:32:08 Mungkin kena cari produk yg betul and sesuai dgn sensitive skin. Bila awak pakai oil cleanser and cleanser shj, muka awak x cukup hydration, dia perlukan moisturizer skurang kurangnya. Try cari moisturizer yg lightweight kalau awak x suka yg creamy/tebal.

6342 2018-11-12 15:20:02 Toss in oil, season to taste (salt, pepper, garlic) and roast. When they're done, sprinkle a little balsamic vinegar on them, give them a little stir, and toss 'em back in the oven for a few minutes to let the vinegar get glaze-y.

6344 2018-11-12 15:19:59 Hi so obviously I am massively in support of preventing the destruction of our rainforests and the loss of biodiversity that comes with it but boycotting palm oil isn't the best solution
6345 2018-11-12 15:19:54 I signed a petition that @KelloggCompany is a major company getting palm oil by destroying natural animal habitats!
6346 2018-11-12 15:19:53 My oil cap came off my in my luggage and got all over my brand new dress  
I can never have nice things 
6347 2018-11-12 15:19:49 Today is still going strong.

I drank water that had some lavender oil in it and it made me nauseous.

I had a cough fit and I had to take my asthma medication because I had trouble breathing

I'm very excited to see what's next.
6348 2018-11-12 15:19:48 @MNI_forMomma happy birthday blue baby girl, may Allah increase his barakah in your life

6350 2018-11-12 15:19:25 true risk taking behaviour is applying medicated oil again even tho the last time you did it you accidentally got it into your eye and your eye still feels slightly strange from that
6351 2018-11-12 15:19:25 applied for ACTC, transcript ordered, tattoo appointment set for next week, etsy shop up & running, oil changed, damn I’m doin good today and it’s only 10AM!!! 
6352 2018-11-12 15:19:18 1000% correct!  I have been saying since, as long as I can remember, I have asked why.  We send Billions and Billions in aid to countries that don’t need or deserve it.  Saudi Arabia should provide free oil for life to the U.S.
6353 2018-11-12 15:19:13 If oil is found in your backyard, it's govt's own but if they find Igbo in your backyard, it's your own
6354 2018-11-12 15:19:01 At one point didn't she describe it as a prison?

6356 2018-11-12 15:18:55 Ok let’s all migrate to those rich middle eastern oil states to share their wealth, you know this works both ways!
6357 2018-11-12 15:18:49 Today, the death toll in the California Wildfires has risen to at least 31. The GOP and Big Oil own this. They knew. And it is telling that the President would rather whine about the election results than get a handle on this problem.
6358 2018-11-12 15:18:44 There you go England's gold. England's bankrupt. Scottish oil is keeping the UK afloat. Not for long though as we are leaving soon. Then england is fucked.
6359 2018-11-12 15:18:38 Weird, they've done so well under the Trump presidency.

6365 2018-11-12 15:18:01 Unfortunately we had the power on Obama’s first two years and nothing. Not a damn thing to help the people. They made Bush’s tax cut for the rich permanent and increased oil drilling but no Medicare for All.
6366 2018-11-12 15:17:59 Thanks for the #dinnerideas . Might have to try this tomorrow. All #freefood apart from the oil so can #Foodoptimise #SlimmingWorld #HealthyEating #WestonSuperMare @SlimmingWorld
6367 2018-11-12 15:17:53 And it used to be whale oil, your point? We need to stop innovating now cuz why? Oil and gas companies deserve their monopoly forever? I don’t believe that. America always finds better ways to do things.
6368 2018-11-12 15:17:52 WITH BOILED BEEF, HOT WATER GINGER COOKIES 1 teaspoon ginger 1/2 cup oil (preferably oil rack in the making soup.
6369 2018-11-12 15:17:48 opsss sorry walay chicken oil kay nahutdan hahahahaha

6371 2018-11-12 15:17:35 Oregano Oil is a magic elixir. Any health food store in town will have it.
6372 2018-11-12 15:17:25 Australia gifted Eucalyptus to California during the Gold Rush, these trees happen to produce incredibly flammable oil and are known to explode when on fire, so yeah
6373 2018-11-12 15:17:17 Cook with lots oil
6374 2018-11-12 15:17:16 Brapa sih harga per botolnya oil lintahnya
6375 2018-11-12 15:17:12 Note that misogynist is not in quotes so I guess we should just accept that as fact
6376 2018-11-12 15:17:07 Et elles sont très mal défendues.Davantage le basque,breton,alsacien,corse,occitan et catalan.Mais très mal pour le flamand,très mal pour les langues d'oïl, très mal pour l'arpitan (francoprovençal). Or c'est aussi le patrimoine de la France. On ne peut pas les laisser mourir 2/2
6377 2018-11-12 15:17:05 Free olive oil would save me at least $30 a month on the food budget.
6378 2018-11-12 15:16:54 Good can I use the one in ur acct now

6380 2018-11-12 15:16:45 ilabas ang chicken oil 
6381 2018-11-12 15:16:44 Skippy doesn't know we paid for a pipeline that was finished in 1953 and has pumped oil ever since. He's THAT dumb.
6382 2018-11-12 15:16:30 Also, the largest benefactors in the oil and gas industry are the state, local, and federal governments. All you need to do is look how much taxes come out per gallon.
6383 2018-11-12 15:16:29 @Tfl can you answer a question? All these lorry’s driving around London they are heavy oil (diesel)? Will they have to be all electric by 2020? If not why not?
6384 2018-11-12 15:16:20 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
6385 2018-11-12 15:16:13 I find it very difficult to get excited about fish oil
6386 2018-11-12 15:15:58 Ion care about the free food but the free oil change I’ll def take
6387 2018-11-12 15:15:56 Can you oil the hinges of your knee brace
6388 2018-11-12 15:15:54 Yeah? I may need to try that. U ever heard of Bulletproof Coffee? Or coffee with MCT Oil and Butter?
6389 2018-11-12 15:15:52 Families need to ask the main household purchaser to look at what products they buy and ensure they stop buying ones with Palm oil otherwise all of this dialogue is just that...Dialogue. We need actual action so talk to friends and family and be the change. 2/2
6390 2018-11-12 15:15:48 Shrimp processor held liable for repayment of amount it received pursuant to a settlement of oil spill damage claims, as it misrepresented itself as an ongoing business when claim filed & it knew or should have known it was a "failed business" & therefore ineligible for payment.
6391 2018-11-12 15:15:48 Whip together 2 quarts Cabbage with 8 oz broccoli. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve on salad
6392 2018-11-12 15:15:48 America didn't join the war because of Pearl Harbour. There were other factors, including America's marine embargo of Jaoan cutting off their oil supply. Without oil, they were helpless and had to attack. America was counting on that. They wanted in the war and needed a reason.
6393 2018-11-12 15:15:45 Hell nahhhhI use every money that comes my way not just mine
6394 2018-11-12 15:15:44 curious though, the competing fish oil generics, do they have the same or similar results as vascepa?
6395 2018-11-12 15:15:40 - it feels so good when you spray oil & water on your scalp when you have braids. 
6396 2018-11-12 15:15:35 got my oil changed now my engine light wont go off ugh
6397 2018-11-12 15:15:31 What I hope this does achieve is that we ask ourselves or our partners what products we purchase that use Palm Oil. I for one am guilty I discovered. I use Coffee mate from Nestle (Powdered milk) I have now stopped buying it of course. 1/2
6398 2018-11-12 15:15:29 Ohohohooooo. Hunny.. it's a well-known fact that 9/11 was an inside job as an excuse for war for oil. I'm surprised that it's 2018 and someone still believe it was done by the muslim terrorist.
6399 2018-11-12 15:15:25 ボディクリーム塗るよ？脱いで？
6400 2018-11-12 15:15:20 Just once I’d like to get an oil change without anything else being wrong with my car
6401 2018-11-12 15:15:18 The myth about big oil is the average American doesn't understand depletion and depreciation. The latter, is a available to so many & you don't have to be in the oil & gas business. It's part of the IRS tax code. Pay attention to profit margins. They are very small for oil & gas.
6402 2018-11-12 15:15:17 Le français doit pouvoir être plus, mieux parlé en Nouvelle-Ecosse, Ile du Prince Edouard et bien-sûr le Nouveau-Brunswick, mais la forme de langue d'oïl typique qu'est l'acadien, aussi. En France , en Belgique wallonne, en Suisse romande, on a des langues locales 1/
6403 2018-11-12 15:15:17 This is all about Oil power and control protect the people who voted for your bad business deal ass and your failures and poor judgement is hurting the country America.

6405 2018-11-12 15:15:14 Coconut oil is generally overhyped BUT in cooler months I actually just put coconut oil on my armpits. It's not an antiperspirant, but it is weirdly effective in terms of keeping it not stinky, even if I manage to sweat a bit. 

I use normal antiperspirant in the summer though.
6406 2018-11-12 15:15:10 Okay confirm dah tak ngam dgn mineral oil dalam co biore, mengamok naik
6407 2018-11-12 15:14:58 Relax, my love -smiles and keeps teasing his hole as I pour some more oil and slide my fingers into him as they slide in easily stroking his warm insides- so warm, spread your legs for me, slut
6408 2018-11-12 15:14:42 Oil of Oregano works really well for me to Mandee. I always take it if I’m feeling crappy and it really seems to help!!

6411 2018-11-12 15:13:51 Great article @RRabins. We're seeing more and more uses for emerging tech in Oil and Gas especially #augmentedreality #ar
6412 2018-11-12 15:13:50 Yeah, that's what I said. I was like "Excuse me?" and he said the air filter was $50 plus labor. Plus $80 for a synthetic oil change.
6413 2018-11-12 15:13:42 Financial market prices are driven by liquidity, not news. The large desks, who buy or short the majority of oil contracts, move the price.  It’s a big mistake to conclude after one day of price movement.

6417 2018-11-12 15:13:34 Jesus is watching.

6422 2018-11-12 15:13:06 So I spent my whole day at work today helping my boss to be sharing  bag of rice and palm oil. This civil servant work is definitely not for me.

6429 2018-11-12 15:12:28 So let’s let you use polyester balls on lacquered lanes oiled to 26 feet and see how well you do.  I am not saying you aren’t an elite talent, because you are.  I am just saying 90% of the reason for higher scores these days IS ball tech and oil.
6430 2018-11-12 15:12:27 Sustainable only means the trees aren't killed to get the oil - not that they are suitable habitat for anything.
6431 2018-11-12 15:12:27 MR.Abiy has not given up on the illegal shares at #Berbera Port given to Ethiopia by #UAE @DPWorldUAE .That means #Ethiopia has recognized Somaliland as a sovreign country. Ethiopia is after  deposits of #OIL & GAS in the Somali Republic therefore they must subcolonize Somalia.

You have lost it all.
6437 2018-11-12 15:11:17 "A secondary analysis showed taking fish oil lowered the risk of heart attack by about 28 percent, which is a 'statistically significant' finding, says Dr. JoAnn Manson, who is chief of the division of preventive medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston."

6440 2018-11-12 15:10:59 But, you leave the ones that really are responsible [for terrorist acts], like Saudi Arabia, which is the center for propaganda and funding and so on for radical Islamic Jihadism, well you can’t touch them because of business interests, also they have oil and so on and so forth.

6448 2018-11-12 15:10:08 The oil is only a small% of our assets and we would have to get our share of the UK assets aswell.
6449 2018-11-12 15:10:05 Construction began in February of 1952, dummy. The oil started flowing the following year and flows to this day. That's the answer to Skippy's question. Use Google.

6452 2018-11-12 15:09:56 From the article: "...found a 28 percent reduction {heart attacks}among those taking fish oil, with a 40 percent reduction in people who eat little fish and a 77 percent reduction in African-Americans. "
6453 2018-11-12 15:09:52  Funny because it's true! Made from those evil oil products too!
6454 2018-11-12 15:09:49 They want to waste huge amounts of resources that will have zero impact on what they think is the cause of this.  It is much cheaper and more effective to direct resources to manage the impact any change has.  Example, proper land management of government lands.

6459 2018-11-12 15:09:28 There must be 20+ fish oil generics on the market.  I don’t think commercial success will be as easy as everyone makes it out to be.  Certainly not in the multi-billions.  Maybe $300-$400M peak revs with perfect execution from their sales team.

6465 2018-11-12 15:08:43 What???  They control 60% of the worlds oil? Ripple use to own 80% and the founders owned the other 20% Oil is an actual usable comitity. Xrp is a made up code that is in fact dumped to fund ripple

6470 2018-11-12 15:08:27 Rock Calendar 11-12-79: Pres. Carter stops all oil imports from Iran in response to 63 Americans being taken hostage at the U.S. embassy Nov 4th.
6471 2018-11-12 15:08:24 So....by definition, being that it is San Francisco, 99.9% of the bullets she removes come from illegal guns.
6472 2018-11-12 15:08:18 If Masaru only knew what happened to Fenrir... He would pour even more oil into the fire. 

     He tilts his head, clicking his tongue. "I wonder how you will do that in your current state . . or once I've pulled your fangs. A lap dog doesn't need them." So, so much worse. +
6473 2018-11-12 15:08:16 Bullshit! Gas sanctions affect everything and everyone! Ambulances, generators, school buses, public transportation. When was the last time #Iran invaded a sovereign nation as the US did for oil?! What credibility does the US have beside big guns?

6475 2018-11-12 15:08:11 Got to love car dealerships. Bring in your car for 1st oil change they tell you multiple times. It’s free along with a tire rotation they tell you. Then the appointment arrives & they say you don’t have a maintenance plan with us. David McDavid appears to be a low cred operation.
6476 2018-11-12 15:08:08 wow I've been cutting about college for hours with yellow oil paint on my foreheed
6477 2018-11-12 15:08:08 wouldn't consider anything that snake oil salesman offers. Tell him what it is and walk.
6478 2018-11-12 15:07:50 Blimey. I mean, it's a good step towards Palm Oil awareness. But some people I know are acting like they've spent 20 years on The Rainbow Warrior...
6479 2018-11-12 15:07:39 An Oil Standard view, eh? 
6480 2018-11-12 15:07:33 Hey Don, how many times did the U.S. have to save France from destroying itself?

Officially, what, like 2 times at least in the 20th century? Nazi sympathizers and all.

Let's see what else. Oh, right. Clinton convinced Obama to topple Gaddafi so France could take their oil. 
6481 2018-11-12 15:07:26 Oil upmove next leg started.....???
6482 2018-11-12 15:07:15 2) Considering what’s going on it make sense this could be correct. After all Saudi Oil would be an answer to the Big Coup with $ as they are shrinking and loosing the war. Rothschilds are facing serious trouble with loosing business in many countries.

6485 2018-11-12 15:07:08 I’ve got two candles going now. One is a patchouli base. If that doesn’t cut it, I’ll blow them out and see if the smoke helps mask it. I also may try my oil diffuser if I can sequester my cat from it. I. Hate. Vinegar.
6486 2018-11-12 15:06:46 Also, CBD oil is next on my research list. Anxiety sucks.
6487 2018-11-12 15:06:41 This is the whole problem with the environmental crowd.  They think reducing carbon emissions would stop this.  Even if their models are correct, zero US carbon emissions over the last five wouldn’t have changed anything today.
6488 2018-11-12 15:06:29 We try to avoid those types of foods anyways because they don’t wear the non gmo verified label. We also use coconut oil for cooking, grape seed or olive. Thanks for the lesson, I had no idea about palm oil, how disgraceful!

6490 2018-11-12 15:06:17 CNN & MSNBC characterizing people on other networks as NAZI, RACISTS or other choice labels- constantly- are apparently believed by their ignorant viewers who never take the time to investigate the lies told by these snake oil salesmen of cable media.

6493 2018-11-12 15:05:44 You answered your own question in the article!

That’s a 192-Mt cut, requiring the equivalent of shutting down Canada’s entire oil and gas sector (189.5 Mt annually) in 12 years.

The question for Canadians is simple, do you support shutting down Canada's resource industries?
6494 2018-11-12 15:05:41 I will too, boiling oil makes me hate cooking

6499 2018-11-12 15:05:12 So, I am trying to avoid palm oil. The first three things in my cupboard I've picked out have some in. Shopping is going to be interesting today. There's got to be an alternative surely?

6503 2018-11-12 15:04:57 Yes!!!! Most chocolate has the dirty oil as well as candy and chips, its even added in beauty products. Buy products that don't contain palm oil. I know its hard but its possible ... and worth the trouble.
6504 2018-11-12 15:04:49 Looool...when they are gradually moving away from oil and embracing other forms of energy
6505 2018-11-12 15:04:48 The flaring is done by these shortsighted oil companies with the permission of NG govt. Abacha killed Ken Saro Wiwa for speaking up years ago. Today gas flaring still goes on, power isn't steady. Thanks for boosting awareness @GuardianNigeria

6518 2018-11-12 15:03:44 I am so excited to get my oil changed today I have nearly forgotten that I have 2 research essays due this month
6519 2018-11-12 15:03:41 Sissss it's just oil.
6520 2018-11-12 15:03:36 To those if you applauding the oil price dropping. 
LOOK PAST THE PUMP
With this price level we will never be energy independent. 
The people price gouging are the foreign convienance store owners, not the oil companies.
This price level is destroying lives and businesses.

Abi u want us to remind u,u were borrowing to pay salaries,with 23 States unable to pay just bcos oil slipped from $100+ to $70?

But with oil below $40,PMB was paying&bailing out States& abandoned pensioners.

U want to compare inflation?
6527 2018-11-12 15:03:19 This is like the 5th day I forgot my garage opener, getting tired of hopping out to change so much oil!!!

6529 2018-11-12 15:03:14 If you change oil right, run the engine awhile before to get the oil hot so it’ll drain completely. And bring more contaminants with it. So I’ll give her a pass for dropping the plug, cause I’ve done it too. Hot oil and it’s slippery.

6532 2018-11-12 15:02:59 Random thought: if we convert to alternative energies we'll have the ability to upgrade cyber-vulnerable devices (SCADA perhaps) and will a) no longer rely on Russia & the Middle East for oil and b) have more secure systems resistant to cyber attack.
6533 2018-11-12 15:02:42 Just thinking about the miracle that Elisha performed in 2 Kings 4:1-7. He told her not to ask for a few jars for her oil. When all the jars were full the oil stopped flowing. Don’t limit God with little faith!

6544 2018-11-12 15:00:53 It’s awful just the sheer amount of destruction we cause on a daily basis, but lots of companies are moving towards sustainable palm oil, and it’s very achievable for us to have a lot of these sustainable products in our everyday lives, I wish you the very best in going for this
6545 2018-11-12 15:00:46 Take a wash cloth and either get it wet with hot water or just get it wet and put it in the microwave, don’t make it too hot, then if you have either peppermint or lavender oil put some on the towel then just put the towel on your neck (You don’t need the oil but it’s nice)

6559 2018-11-12 14:59:47 The government subsidises oil while removing subsidies for renewable energy, gives contracts to fracking companies even though there's overwhelming support for a fracking ban, you recycling is all well and good but it's small fry compared to the things the government could be do.

6576 2018-11-12 14:56:59 I target clients that have the same values as me. ie. companies that are cruelty free in the way they produce their products / don't use palm oil. And I make sure to mention that in my introduction. You'll feel much better about the job you do for them as well. #JobAdviceSA
6577 2018-11-12 14:56:52 Sorry - that's a lousy argument to keep producing oil. What part of #climatechange do you not get?
6578 2018-11-12 14:56:49 I'm with you! Palm oil is terrible not to mention it violated human rights.
6579 2018-11-12 14:56:48 I did not know that! This rig was a little west of Saline. The DI well card says it's drilling horizontally for oil.
6580 2018-11-12 14:56:48 Been there, done that, no oil on legs in the remodelled planes, but at least Andy could have tried! WW1 pilots wore goggles & scarves to clean them because hot oil would splash on their faces! Andy played it safe and avoided the WW1 replica planes in which he *could* have flown.
6581 2018-11-12 14:56:48 So many to blame for non response to climate change.  Oil companies, coal companies, Koch etc.  Wonder what agenda leads you to focus on Sanders?  A handful of politicians sound climate alarm.  Hint:  they are not the enemy.
6582 2018-11-12 14:56:47 If were living cruelty free we should add to that not purchasing products produced in slave labour or child labour conditions, products responsible for destroying the planet like palm oil or soya etc. I agree that if we do it it should be total not selective.
6583 2018-11-12 14:56:25 It's good to see this issue getting some publicity and this initiative is a start, but the quote is misleading as it's only own brand items that are free of palm oil.
6584 2018-11-12 14:56:18 California? Producer is the world’s dirtiest oil.    
Forest fires are natural. A few plants require fire to spread their seeds. 
Building houses inside forests and having no fire barriers is the issue.
6585 2018-11-12 14:56:14 The humidity levels different in England, plus London's pollution seeps in. Try adding an oil at the end for a barrier.
6586 2018-11-12 14:56:03 Oil companies spent over $30 million to defeat a carbon tax in WA state. Think of all the good that conservation groups could do with that kind of money. It’s disgusting.
6587 2018-11-12 14:56:02 I prefer to avoid propaganda, not invite it in. Also, I don’t join front groups for the gas and oil industry. I prefer to associate myself with people less greedy and selfish.
6588 2018-11-12 14:55:58 Well it for persons with dermatitis issues. The The coconut oil has antimicrobial and antifungal properties that helps reduce dermatitis flares up. E.g eczema, psoriasis or any other sclap related issues. It also contains vitamin E that will reduce oxidative stress on the scalp
6589 2018-11-12 14:55:33 City has obviously replaced the blood in its players with unfeeling oil and human rights abuses
6590 2018-11-12 14:55:23 Hi Beccy, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again
6591 2018-11-12 14:55:18 But @Jeremy_Hunt will your words really have any impact? We are not blameless in this issue. The time has come to do what is morally right not financial reasons. Why won’t you and the government start to reduce arms sales and oil purchases from Saudi Arabia?

6611 2018-11-12 14:53:22 If you saw my first tweet (1) it stated that while Trump was in Europe for NATO conference,Merkel was negotiating secretly with Putin to purchase billions of Euros in Russian oil. After Trump confronted her with this she stopped negotiating with Putin & bought from us.
6612 2018-11-12 14:53:16 Basing oil use off of antiquated non-renewable theology may not be the way to go, since for some reason the oil fields are filling up again.
6613 2018-11-12 14:53:09 Idk...I ordered from a food co-op when I last lived in Cape Town, and they had a stockists for sustainable cleaning products and cosmetics. I wasn't checking for palm oil, but they are probably a good bet. I can put you in touch with the woman who sourced suppliers?
6614 2018-11-12 14:53:04 Breathing exercises in bed, I use supplements and essential oil, if you're interested in them let me know but the free stuff I use is breathing, there's breathing exercises on YouTube for sleep

6630 2018-11-12 14:50:27 the majority of fast food places, all the chains anyway, use vegetable oil to fry with, and while it's true it doesn't come from animals, when heated to frying temperature anything fried in it will start to rot immediately upon removal from the oil.  This can be irritating to...

6687 2018-11-12 14:44:31 Yeah, you really need to look at the ingredient list of all the things you buy. You'd be surprised at how many food products use it. Also, consider that if it comes in plastic packaging, it was probs produced using palm oil.

6737 2018-11-12 14:38:40 So i know someone that buys these arabian perfume oil, something like that sha for like 1k per bottle from a northern guy, tho it's small & i see some people online & elsewhere selling just a lil bit more of the same thing for abt 5k, pls why the price difference?
6738 2018-11-12 14:38:37 When iran can't sell oil  , can't make any money , and you think how afford the cost of food and medicine???
6739 2018-11-12 14:38:27 Kenapa nutox tak ada? I baru pakai cleansing oil and cleansing gel also toner.. moisturizer blm try lagi.. ada review x?
6740 2018-11-12 14:38:17 You mean for cooking? Butter or olive oil or coconut oil. But aside from cooking, so many companies use palm oil in their products and/or the packaging it comes in, so where does it end really.. 
6741 2018-11-12 14:38:12 While Trump was in Europe for NATO conference, Merkel was secretly negotiating w/Putin to purchase oil from Russia, a billions of Euros deal. Trump confronted her & she later quit. NATO wants us to protect them while they negotiate with"enemy" Russia.

6743 2018-11-12 14:38:11 Feel Sugar stocks would be best bet to hedge oil
6744 2018-11-12 14:38:10 Have you tried bio oil? I have some dark spots too & bio oil is the onnnnnnly thing that does wonders for scars/dark spots/uneven skin tones.
6745 2018-11-12 14:38:01 A falling rupee as well as rising crude oil prices dented market sentiment further.
6746 2018-11-12 14:37:56 ALL NATIONS ARE AGAINST ISREAL!   WHY!  THEY ARE SITTING ON A GOLD MIND CALL...OIL!  OTHER NATIONS ARE RUNNING OUT OF OIL!

6748 2018-11-12 14:37:44 Canada can't get it's oil to market. Pipelines and rails are congested. Storage facilities are full. Output is up but infrastructure to movie it couldn't keep up.  @JustinTrudeau @MaximeBernier @AndrewScheer

6751 2018-11-12 14:37:18 Did I tell you that shrunk was not caused by drop in oil price? I didn't say so, but I told you there was no blue print from inception by the APC administration. 
I also mentioned that the economy was sick but APC did the kill. This is 2018 and what did this administration

6754 2018-11-12 14:37:05 ... some wee little problems
Merkel is now building a LPG port...
Oil prices dropped 20% in the last 60 days

Cause you cognative dissonance?

I don't CARE what the EU thinks
6755 2018-11-12 14:36:59 Unionists (Labour and Tory) deprived many Scots kids from utilising their fare share of oil revenues to have decent heated, and damp free social housing, and smaller class sizes. Refer to McCrone report findings and their suppression. That is politicising kids, we remember.
6756 2018-11-12 14:36:58 $AMRN mineral oil controversy....maybe.....the fact is the short term trend is broken on the 9 and 20 day ema.  The good news is out so wait for the stock to regain its short term trend.  M&A takes months....
6757 2018-11-12 14:36:57 @HotelChocolat I'm confused. I thought you didn't use palm oil but it's listed as an ingredient on a present I've been given from your range. Do I need to cancel my subscription?
6758 2018-11-12 14:36:55 You guys are snake oil salesmen. Except the snake oil is a false sense of camaraderie and hype about being all about military families. It’s exploitation and dishonesty pure & simple. Now forward that feedback from the millions of vets out there you routinely shaft for “honor”.
6759 2018-11-12 14:36:54 No human being on Earth can accurately predict the exact direction of oil in the short term as you have producers increasing/decreasing supply. For oil one just needs to have good risk management. But we are talking about silver here.
6760 2018-11-12 14:36:41 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.

6764 2018-11-12 14:36:29 Can somebody please recommend me something for a dry scalp. I've tried olive oil Jamaican castor oil coconut oil
6765 2018-11-12 14:36:29 Hiya Heather! We're working on a review of all our palm oil containing products to check for sustainability, as well as introducing a palm oil tag for product listings. Hopefully it'll be in place in the near future :) Leigh x
6766 2018-11-12 14:36:23 Doesnt the oil clog my pores though?
6767 2018-11-12 14:36:19 And that’s exactly why this advert was stopped so many big names use Palm oil.
6768 2018-11-12 14:36:02 Baby oil 
6769 2018-11-12 14:35:42 CBD oil? I’m looking into this.

6771 2018-11-12 14:35:37 i just mixed half a teaspoon of olive oil spread with a tablespoon of fig preserves into quaker oats and it's yummy. with a cup of green tea
6772 2018-11-12 14:35:19 What about banning palm oil
6773 2018-11-12 14:35:16 Exactly. Fox has NOT abdicated it ability to drive the narrative and amplify Trump’s trash “messaging”. Esp not in the moment of these recounts in FL and a chance to undermine climate science by addressing CA. Fox advertisers/big oil would not have surrendered that willingly.
6774 2018-11-12 14:35:16 The points Vivian made that we would be outraged if another country was attacking our wheat or dairy industry is spot on. We have documented proof animal agriculture is worse than oil but it is taboo to talk about it. We need to stop foreign interests.
6775 2018-11-12 14:35:15 The Horrors the people of Effiat Coastal Communities in Akwa Ibom State have been subjected to by the Multinational Oil Companies operating in the state namely Oriental Energy Resources, Moni-Pulo, Addax Petroleum, Total E&P, Mobil Nigeria etc is terrible, we shall respond soon..

6778 2018-11-12 14:35:02 My mom puts onion in frying pan along with oil and then apply it on my hair. Its good too
6779 2018-11-12 14:34:57 히히
6780 2018-11-12 14:34:41 Only banned on UK telly. So it's not really that big a deal. It's not prevented them from posting it everywhere else and they have not been banned from doing the most important job of not supplying goods known to use bad sourced palm oil.
6781 2018-11-12 14:34:40 #ADIPEC is the biggest event for Oil and Gas in the region, participating in such events will give #GSW a great chance to show customizable industrial solutions and to expand its opportunities.
6782 2018-11-12 14:34:25 $AMRN I thought I saw that Herper was rethinking the mineral oil issue.  Do you know if he has written anything to that end?
6783 2018-11-12 14:34:18 it's a shocker how many foods and products are called nature's-something-or-other but have palm oil in them. there are some muesli/granola brands that use other oils (you just have to label shop).
6784 2018-11-12 14:34:14 Eggless mayo looks like a white oil paint, smells like pva adhesives, tastes acidulent. How a small green dot ruins good things

6786 2018-11-12 14:34:02 This was me in 2015 & 2016 

I just ignored the itchiness , And started using Magnolia Tissue Oil from Pep Store. It's R20. really helps with the spots
6787 2018-11-12 14:33:58 Do not use too much MCT Oil, I repeat do not use too much lol.
6788 2018-11-12 14:33:48 you need tea tree oil
6789 2018-11-12 14:33:39 Really? The only reason the Tent of Saud buys US-UK-NATO weapons with Oil Cash is to commit war crimes on Sunnis in its own 
Al-Sharqiyyah province, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.
6790 2018-11-12 14:33:38 On the #PalmOil issue, remember the E numbers a few years back?
So all the companies do is:
1) change the names or mix of ingredients,
2) plain & simple redesign of labels to tout being "oil free" & "forgetting" to put Palm oil on the label!

Been done before!

Would YOU know?

6793 2018-11-12 14:33:28 You are as wrong now as you were when you called for oil to move to 100 from 75 before it touched 59.
6794 2018-11-12 14:33:18 "Extraction" economies won't do well in the next 50 years. Real $$ in today's world is created with IP, not tangible commodities. In particular, the end of oil could be really ugly...

6799 2018-11-12 14:32:17 1 SaudiArabiawants the output of crude oil to be cut by 1m barrels per day!

@DonaldJTrumpJr if that #war starts, u could be reelected

The #MiddleEast is far too stable! #GazaStrip #Syria #Yemen

btw what's irony?
NOT FUNNY!
6800 2018-11-12 14:32:16 Pretty sure all of them are still collecting.

6803 2018-11-12 14:31:53 If Nigeria can achieve anything above 60% non oil revenue then, we can say we have an economy and we are on d path of progress till then, most analyses u will see on this street are those of political convenience.
6804 2018-11-12 14:31:49 Then we go for substitutes 

Codliver oil

6807 2018-11-12 14:31:43 I'm running out of my lavender oil :(
6808 2018-11-12 14:31:38 3. It’s important for coastal towns to try and diversify and not put all their eggs in one basket. That’s exactly the kind of thing Saudi Arabia is waking up to and trying to move away from oil dependency, UK coastal towns could follow suit with assistance from Westminster.
6809 2018-11-12 14:31:37 Let the oil run dry
6810 2018-11-12 14:31:27 Worldwide movement of nationalism.  Pushed by large oil interests in Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States.  They don't like climate change or renewable energy.
6811 2018-11-12 14:31:21 Oh and his dad had property they found out was built on top of an oil well. She always refused to move in with him. She found out about the oil well and moved her shit in so fast, his head spun I have so many Bill stories we’d be here all week!
6812 2018-11-12 14:31:19 Palm oil = good; governance = bad
6813 2018-11-12 14:31:19 Na bad leaders we been get, corrupt idiots that shared the oil wells to themselves. On the other hand, Dubai get better leaders
6814 2018-11-12 14:31:17 Yes! First time this summer. Thieves oil running nonstop in diffuser. Zinc, elderberry. Hand washing, obvi. Wiping down phone and door handles constantly. Windows open when you can! Wash sheets in hot water. Pretending to prefect fist bumping instead of hugging!
6815 2018-11-12 14:31:11 Because pulling oil out of the ground will kill us all Neera. “Believing in climate change” while opening the Arctic for drilling and allying with petrostates will kill us

6819 2018-11-12 14:31:07 Singapore went from a third world country to a first world country in a single generation. Nigeria with all its oil, agriculture and mineral resources is still a developing country. So embarrassing.

6822 2018-11-12 14:30:52 Honestly the next dispensery run I want to pick up flower. I think the oil changed how I get high. While it's more cost effective maybe it isn't when I don't have to smoke as much
6823 2018-11-12 14:30:45 Trut. It's so hard to find stuff that doesn't use palm oil anymore.

6827 2018-11-12 14:30:23 Plz, show us the stat that says non oil revenue is amount to 61.3% exceeding that of oil so that I will start believing that d shrunk wasnt caused by plunge in oil price & lack of savings. Plz, don't come with d amount of non oil sector of d GDP they are 2 different things!

6837 2018-11-12 14:29:39 Don't see any intraday sentiment drivers atm. Bought oil at the electronic open yesterday for reasons, will try to keep it alive. I think I'll just take the time off to do check my trade statistics
6838 2018-11-12 14:29:30 May be due to oil companies contributing to statue of unity

6844 2018-11-12 14:29:01 How does Canada makes money selling oil at $16 a barrel? US prices are around $60. In Oct. Canadian crude traded at a $51 discount to US oil. Because of discount Canadian producers are leaving $40m a day on the table. Energy 11% of GDP.

6851 2018-11-12 14:27:41 There’s a sustainable palm oil app created by @CheyenneMtnZoo that will tell you which products are orangutan friendly. Since it’s nearly impossible to avoid palm oil the app will tell you what products are sustainable (products properly produced and not from deforestation)

6863 2018-11-12 14:26:39 Trudeau's secret agenda. He never campaigned on creating a post national state, open borders or stopping the oil industry developments. Yet that appears to be the bedrock of his policies.
6864 2018-11-12 14:26:27 That too. The Romans divided the world into civilized olive oil users and barbarian butter eaters.

6876 2018-11-12 14:25:52 I would hope something like that exists already tbh. But again, not the point of this conversation. Most people won't even be aware of palm oil or it's impact. This is about awareness.

6878 2018-11-12 14:25:38 Great to hear some proper debate being had in the BBC - looking to address the real issues of today.  1 - They're all chips (which is good)  2 -  "There's more than one way to skin a potato".  3 - If cooking at 150C ensure the chips are dry.  If wet they will absorb too much oil
6879 2018-11-12 14:25:28 Hi Catriona. For many years we've paid a premium for every gram of palm oil derivative used direct to sustainable palm oil growers. We were doing this long before many other skincare brands, are committed to continuing it...

6895 2018-11-12 14:24:46 Yes. That's my point. I don't think banning palm oil is a good idea, or even plausible. A certifying body who could guarantee sustainable sources of the product for manufacturers globally, who could then certify the sustainability of the palm oil they buy, is a great idea...

6900 2018-11-12 14:23:54 At least for now, they don't have much choice.  But, later, they might.  Protein and oil (veg and petroleum) are all going to go somewhere, even it seems now to Iran.  Trading really does force friendships, it appears!

6903 2018-11-12 14:22:56 Well essentially oil is more in their control than XRP is in Ripples. Also for XRP to thrive it must be utilized not a pump and dump where Ripple sells their holdings. I’m sorry but please do your research if you actually are interested in the truth.

6908 2018-11-12 14:22:37 Yes, but to be fair, replacing palm oil with a more environmentally destructive alternative, rather than sustainable palm oil, is just moving the problem elsewhere and making it worse. Ad would then be misleading.

7002 2018-11-12 14:14:41 Hi, Palmer’s and its palm oil suppliers are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.
7003 2018-11-12 14:14:40 In Houston this week with the PwC global Oil & Gas family. Looking forward to catching up with clients and colleagues!
7004 2018-11-12 14:14:38 Hmm….I think it goes on a lot more things than regulatory agencies! This seriously grates when discussing this with remainers – you can’t make a general point because it becomes your sole reason for Brexit. The point isn’t about oranges, bananas or olive oil, they were simply…
7005 2018-11-12 14:14:24 I know right (re: oats)? my son eats it too. the other versions sadly do have palm oil :( 

hint for chips: the smaller brands some fruit and veg shops stock, might be made with sunflower oil etc. (i have found a brand at ours that is delicious)
7006 2018-11-12 14:14:24 ありがとうございまーーーすっっヽ(*´∀｀)ノ

7007 2018-11-12 14:14:17 Uhh so the SEC wouldn’t think XRP is a security to Ripple? Owning XRP gives you zero shares into Ripple. Chevron likes oil, is that a scam? Ripple knows the XRP ledger is the best digital asset that’s why they push it.

7011 2018-11-12 14:14:08 I love this commercial. It's sad when trying to save the environment/habitat is deemed political. I've been reading ingredients at the store to see if an item contains palm oil and putting it back on the shelf if I see it
7012 2018-11-12 14:13:43 It sure wouldn't surprise me if that were the case. Not only is he child raping scum, but he lied about his story and even his name.... he definitely doesn't rig oil either lmao  nor is he a "fabulously rich widowed man" either. He's SUCH a total piece of shit it isn't funny

7026 2018-11-12 14:12:35 SNP MP's are calling on ukgov to devolve oil and gas revenues. We know what they'll say, but at least EU will know about it so it may just stop it being a bargaining chip.

7028 2018-11-12 14:12:29 It's easy 4 a Company backed by oil 2 spout all the up-sides 2 oil. But the fact the oil industry has 2 spend millions of dollars just 2 promote the benefits tells ppl that they're worried that their "solution" isn't really what ppl want. Imagine what renewables could do w/ 40mil
7029 2018-11-12 14:12:21 I am SO relieved Oatso Easy original doesn't have palm oil. Literally my breakfast every day. 

Also, my household is gonna be PISSED that there will be no more Lays Chips in the house.
7030 2018-11-12 14:12:19 You forgot to mention that most palm oil is sourced sustainably and that it's 7 times more efficient in terms of land space than alternative crops (soya etc) with less need for pesticides. 
7031 2018-11-12 14:12:16 @NutellaGlobal you’ve gotta stop using palm oil, make an example

7062 2018-11-12 14:09:19 I disagree with that. Data for silver is nowhere as clear cut as with oil or some other commodities. Silver has been in a bear market for years and to say that there is a deficit seems quite misguided.

7143 2018-11-12 14:02:54 At this point, so much of store bought pastry has some sort of maybe palm oil mouth feel. Not sure what it is but I can’t eat it anymore
7144 2018-11-12 14:02:52 It’s disgrace that @IcelandFoods ad was banned . It’s an important topic and the animation is great way to convey to importance of protecting those animals who can’t protect themselves . A palm oil free future is needed
7145 2018-11-12 14:02:41 .its a shirt term solution as we transition to hydrogen engines that emit water. OK but can you get responsibly sourced palm oil (if there is such a thing @nestle say so) for your fuel please.

7147 2018-11-12 14:02:29 WW1 was an establishment war and nothing to do with 'freedom',  that's just BS propaganda to get ordinary people at the time to support  it. UK Tommies died for oil, power, influence and land grab.
7148 2018-11-12 14:02:22 Not like those good guys in Venezuela - who took a flourishing economy, supported by the largest oil reserves in the hemisphere, and turned into a nation of dog meat eaters who cannot afford toilet paper.

7152 2018-11-12 14:02:00 Let's talk about why it is right the Iceland Christmas Greenpeace palm oil ad is "banned" & if you are angry about that you are angry about the wrong thing. SPOILER: it's NOT because of the topic but because we don't want Tommy Robinson, Farage etc filling our ad breaks (1/14)

7158 2018-11-12 14:00:55 .please answer my question about palm oil?
7159 2018-11-12 14:00:41 Captages et séquestrations qui devraient porter sur des milliards de tonnes pour être significatives. En réalité elles ne concernent au mieux que quelques millions de tonnes et sont donc insignifiantes et onéreuses.

7183 2018-11-12 13:58:03 Thank you, it doesn’t state what products actually have palm oil in it only that you can’t confirm if the palm oil you use is sourced in a sustainable way. Is nestle taking action to change this? I love nestle products but am concerned that it is not sourced in a sustainable way

At least it's spreading awareness of the sickening palm oil trade.

7215 2018-11-12 13:55:08 You’re right it’s more clean and effective. But the health issue a lot of people are having now is called ‘cannabinoid hyperemesis’ which is thought to be from too much THC and other cannabinoids. A cannabis oil would not be better in this specific case.

7260 2018-11-12 13:50:37 Also why use palm oil if products don't require it. You get the same taste with a more sustainable crop. I have a cookie on @VirginTrains first class which has vegetable oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil in it. Is that necessary....
7261 2018-11-12 13:50:24 @jiffylube is not changing my oil  fhor free on vererans day
7262 2018-11-12 13:50:24 Trump allowed excemptions on Iran oil purchases. Why? Why for 3 months? So oil prices wouldn’t go up before the election?
7263 2018-11-12 13:50:16 Why? because they legalized weed that tastes like dirt & edibles and oil & everything else is now more illegal then cocaine?

7275 2018-11-12 13:49:04 I need to buy some almond oil
7276 2018-11-12 13:48:55 me nightmares. I can't bear to hear or see the suffering, yet it doesn't bother them. Some even seem to enjoy it. I saw something that took me several moments to process before I realized what it was. It was a dog screaming as it was thrown across the room into boiling oil. 2/2
7277 2018-11-12 13:48:44 it freezes well in pots, freezer bags etc; make sure it has a bit more olive oil in because that helps it defrost nicely without drying out. no need to make cubes unless you use it a cube at a time!
7278 2018-11-12 13:48:40 Iceland still sell items which include palm oil. The message is good, but if they really meant what they say, surely they’d rid themselves of palm oil products before this viral ad campaign?
Just doesn’t feel sincere.
7279 2018-11-12 13:48:38 Yeah what he said. I think you care about the environment and all it’s beauty and resources. I hate that we are so dependent on oil.

Best way to reverse Saudi's power is aggressive global #climateaction.  Only 2% of Canada's GDP comes from oil.  Saudi Arabia's GDP is 42% oil. #cdnpoli

7303 2018-11-12 13:45:30 What are the risks with fish oil and heart disease? I don’t see any. Also there is some benefit seen with African-Americans. But the article title is so profound to throw the towel in and Afro-AMs get a teeny positive mention. I wonder how many women were in those studies
7304 2018-11-12 13:45:27 Oil Jumps as OPEC Moves Closer to Cutting Output
Oil prices climbed out of the red after weeks of losses that had wiped out all of crude’s gains for 2018, as OPEC signaled a willingness to cut production amid surging global supply.

7358 2018-11-12 13:40:15 I thought abt this. In an ideal world, imo, it should be optimal for NoCs to pursue a EUR (not NPV) maximisation path. But unfortunately their oil polices are wedded with fiscal policies and intractably become hostage to oil prices which should have been none of their concerns.

7369 2018-11-12 13:38:53 There was chatter about it going into the Sunday meeting, but this miniscule 500,000 barrel per day cut feels like desperation. Russia shows no signs of going along, and I doubt they can convince other key members, like Iraq. I think Oil gets to $40 by early next year.

The answer is simple… big companies  are not enforcing their own policies and continue to buy their palm oil  from companies that are destroying rainforests.

7401 2018-11-12 13:34:51 Eso ya es otra discusión. Tampoco creo que Venezuela deba dolarizar. El efecto del petróleo es permanentemente distorsionante y llevaría a un nivel de precios no transable poco competitivo. El modelo es el Noruego, donde la mayoría de los $ del oil están destinados a guardarse.
7402 2018-11-12 13:34:35 Please Vivek ... this headline needs to banished from oil related articles now :)
7403 2018-11-12 13:34:32 Pretty much, sticks, oil, high oven, then salt and parmesan after. So good.

7410 2018-11-12 13:33:51 Yeah, with California olive oil you’re getting what the label says you’re getting and you can really taste the difference.

7418 2018-11-12 13:33:17 I see your point, but I don't see how that has anything to do with being a devout Muslim - that statement weakens your argument. I am not Muslim, but can am critical of democratic leaders raping Muslim countries of oil/access and "selling" it with propagated Islamophobia.
7419 2018-11-12 13:32:44 So Renewable Energy is cheaper than oil right now and oil subsidies help oil become cheaper?

Interesting times.
7420 2018-11-12 13:32:42 That's why many readymade meals have awful stuffing: it's just

bread and herbs. Stuffing needs sausage for body. There are some

very good vegetarian sausages. Needless to say, vegetarians 

and vegabs can't use egg to bind, but a little olive oil can be

used instead.

7422 2018-11-12 13:32:38 Surely anything that brings to light how damaging palm oil is, is a great thing? I don't understand why you'd think otherwise? (i have only seem this short clip, so apologies if i have misunderstood you)
7423 2018-11-12 13:32:25 I don't think you know what oil and bitumen are. Each are a mixture of various hydro-carbons with impurities. Refining is a process of separation. Poor quality means more effort (energy) required, and more cost. Thus less ultimate value.
7424 2018-11-12 13:32:25 Certainly @NicolaSturgeon is head & shoulders above @theresa_may & the @Conservatives front bench when it comes to climate change - but she’s no climate hero. @theSNP need a detailed plan for a v.rapid & just transition from oil & gas to a decarbonised energy infrastructure.
7425 2018-11-12 13:32:13 Come on Helen - you really should know that a bear market can only happen when oil prices drop to under $40 a barrel. At any other time - no matter what is going on - it's a bull market. This is simple stuff....

7448 2018-11-12 13:30:04 WTI crude oil is up more than 1% at around $60.80 a barrel and on track for its first daily increase in more than two weeks, spurred higher after Saudi Arabia said OPEC and its allies should reverse about half the increase in oil output they made earlier this year.

7510 2018-11-12 13:23:13 There are plenty of palm oil free alternatives. There are also sustainability approved items with palm oil. It’s hardly grandstanding or being morally superior for thinking with a global conscience.

- cut out foods cooked in oil. 
- intermittent fasting 16/8 window
if your not doing weights, do them, don't just do cardio.

the rest is just give it time.

7535 2018-11-12 13:20:37 The fat we eat e.g. olive oil (or any others) is mostly triglycerides. Anyone any thoughts on the glycerol to fatty acid ratio, & the percentage of gluconeogenesis substrate the glycerol provides in someone that is "fat adapted" & during normal daily activities? @JimJohnsonSci

7540 2018-11-12 13:19:40 Wow, I remember the days when chatter of an OPEC production cut would send oil 5% higher in an instant. This feeble rally shows two things:
a) the oversupply and falling demand is REAL
b) OPEC is powerless to fight it

7541 2018-11-12 13:19:37 All that oil lol. Nah our food is elite. That is sleeping in the toilet pending.

7548 2018-11-12 13:18:51 I just wanted to pay, but there is no payment channel to choose from.
7549 2018-11-12 13:18:50 This tweet made it on to Global news - slav kornak, reading oiler fan tweets.  I wish u had been writing about being tired of WINNING.  I wonder if this will be a 'Global bump' causing your follower number to spike No reason why EVERYONE should lose when oil does
7550 2018-11-12 13:18:45 Switching to packed lunches after realising every own brand sandwich in Tesco contained palm oil, while every pasta salad was in plastic. It’s thanks to #Iceland’s Rang-Tan advert that I thought to look #NoPalmOilChristmas #PalmOil

7553 2018-11-12 13:18:13 Ah ok...well it's about time then...so they stopped cleaning it up then ( it should be gleaming the amount of days they spent cleaning it)
7554 2018-11-12 13:18:12 Preferably not anywhere - unless someone can come up with a crop that grows in poor soil that's unsuitable for food crops, or some other means of creating palm oil (like the microbial/aglal approach) becomes commercially viable, there's not real solution that solves all issues.

7587 2018-11-12 13:13:20 You do realize lthat the reason the U.S pays large portions as you say is because the world lets us print our own money and they also use our currency for oil purchasing

7617 2018-11-12 13:10:40 Saudi Arabia will reduce Oil supply by 500k barrels per day next month to “support prices” that have been weakened by over-supply. 

We may need to tighten the girdles again in January
7618 2018-11-12 13:10:31 #SaudiArabia plans to reduce #oil supply to world markets by 0.5 million barrels per day in December, its energy minister said on Sunday, as the #OPEC power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree to a coordinated output cut.

7621 2018-11-12 13:10:24 That's not the problem. Most of the money from oil is used to pay salaries of civil servants which is just a fragment of the populace. That's where the problem is.
7622 2018-11-12 13:10:15 @kenjilopezalt Chicken-fried turkey recipe on SE says in Step 5 to heat oil to 425 degrees.  Looks like an error.  Also, first sentence of article omits Wurst Hall.
7623 2018-11-12 13:10:14 Bacon Contains a Lot of Fat. The fats in bacon are about 50% monounsaturated and a large part of those is oleic acid. This is the same fatty acid that olive oil is praised for and generally considered "heart-healthy"

7627 2018-11-12 13:09:51 Last finacial year the tax take from oil was negative 500million due to the help the industry needed. This year it will be £1.2bn, every single penny of it goes straight to Scotland. Total Scottish income is £60bn expenditure £73bn, that's now more than 50% of total UK deficit

7629 2018-11-12 13:09:34 So sad they don't get taken care of after coming home from a war that was just for oil grabbing
7630 2018-11-12 13:09:24 With the absence of oil from Iran, and the Saudis boosting the price, it's another great day for energy alternatives. The wind never stops blowing in the Plains States and some great minds are working to solve the problem of getting power to where it's needed. Time's R Changing!
7631 2018-11-12 13:09:23 Er this is the big reason we have no real action on climate. 

Liberal party is full of ppl with big investments in cdn oil n gas.

No surprise there eg using tax money to bail out failed #tmx pipeline
7632 2018-11-12 13:09:19 I would like you to debate the @IcelandFoods Xmas advert. Instead of screwing poor people with tax on meat shouldn’t we be focused on the bigger environmental issue of palm oil. Perhaps @SkyOceanRescue could help along with single use plastic

We are endowed with resources that give us the potential to be first world but are importing crude soya oil to cover 9 months production. We need to open up the debate to see why there is poverty.
7640 2018-11-12 13:08:05 Probably City fans that sing about Liverpool, all the time are a United fans- but just jumped on the oil ship, because their ship is sinking, so the obsession is still there 
7641 2018-11-12 13:08:01 This money spent is for the protection of the US.  There are hot spots and oil interests etc, all over the world where regimes, Taliban, ISIS,  would attack these US  interests if they could.  And the US President is unaware? Wow.
7642 2018-11-12 13:07:51 TIL there is essentially nothing on the @McDonaldsCanada menu that is trans fat free, not even the salads, or the world famous fries which, if cooked in the right oil, could have easily been. Shame.
7643 2018-11-12 13:07:47 IMHO the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul and the war in Yemen (US doesn't like both), in addition to Iran sanctions (which US is adamant upon). All this makes oil prices very uncertain for next few weeks.
7644 2018-11-12 13:07:45 ไปดูยังงงง ปั๊วะสุดดดด
7645 2018-11-12 13:07:25 Or, more to the point, they ought to blame the previous prov and fed govts who spent years putting all of our eggs in the oil basket. Those govts created the conditions that made our economy so vulnerable to oil price shocks.

For eggs it is due to weather which in May is much hotter than October, price of eggs in winter goes up, for chicken he is lying again. Miftah chose Oil prices of November and vegetables prices of October
7654 2018-11-12 13:06:13 I bet his problem is with housekeeping. Low ratings always go back to cleanliness. Take a shower, use less hair oil and buy some mouth mints Greg and earn an extra star overnight.
7655 2018-11-12 13:05:50 It should be shown although the ban, like all bans  is great publicity. Trouble is there are too many people making money from palm oil. It is a despicable industry & profit driven #PalmOil #PalmOilAlarmCall #PalmOilFreeChristmas

7660 2018-11-12 13:05:18 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7661 2018-11-12 13:05:11 You can’t even read, how can you conceive at all what your doing to our economy and the world.  Try to build a house ,look at oil prices, steel, no one but the top 1% will be buying anything soon.  When it catches up who u going to blame then?
7662 2018-11-12 13:05:06 Apparently since the oil drilling was currently in Upper Nile & Unity, there students of origin were more favored by our selection committee not the Petronas team. It’s therefore possible that capable female students are being removed from this process.
7663 2018-11-12 13:05:00 Max apologized to Seb after the race. Maybe Ocon could have done the same. Instead of that he continued to put verbal oil on the fire.
7664 2018-11-12 13:04:57 Psh. This is the same man who is pushing through fossil fuel development in #Turkana (oil) and #Lamu (coal)? Talking from both sides of the mouth is his speciality.
7665 2018-11-12 13:04:49 Saudi is just adjusting the price because after the sanctions on Iran they(Iran) can’t export oil to big markets such as China and India whom turned towards the Saudis to fulfill their oil needs.
7666 2018-11-12 13:04:46 Unfortunately the side effect of high dose fish oil is the urge to watch “Shape of Water” continuously

And NOBODY is talking about Intermediaries, and that is exactly where the game is played.

7724 2018-11-12 12:58:11 The Iceland ad makes a good point but it only diverts blame, we as consumers are all responsible for the nature of our consumption. Not even the palm oil industry is to blame, they’re a cog in a machine we helped build. We need a cultural revolution, a shift in our nature.
7725 2018-11-12 12:58:03 It's far too scary and upsetting for kids, especially at Christmas. And why are they targeting kids anyway? Most adults haven't got a clue about the damage palm oil is causing. Target the adults, upset and scare the adults.

7761 2018-11-12 12:54:28 It’s factual. Red palm oil is the modern day banana republic. It’s destroying the environment and killing wildlife. That’s not politics those are facts. Politics is greed

7772 2018-11-12 12:53:10 It's sad and heartbreaking to watch. The oil companies need to learn that they are humans too and r not immune to worsening climate conditions. In the end thier billions won't help them.

7790 2018-11-12 12:50:59 Is the desire to get rid of palm oil creating the problem of not enough 'cheap' ingredient to fill out 'food' that would do just as well it not having been there in the first place? Not sure how that's entirely a bad thing, the bloody muck.

Of all oil producing nations, only Kuwait & Venezuela sells petrol cheaper than Nigeria. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Iran & Iraq ALL sell petrol at a higher price than Nigeria

7812 2018-11-12 12:48:04 Also we have a large oil fund which the U.K. doesn’t because the Tories in the 80s wasted the money on tax breaks.
7813 2018-11-12 12:47:49 Another way to help fight against companies using palm oil is to not buy products with palm in it! Nestlé is one of the big ones that use palm in their products when they could be using something else.

7815 2018-11-12 12:47:42 They aren't chopping down rainforest to grow food though just palm oil plantations, I used to wonder why grow rapeseed at all actual food would surely be a better use. If I was a farmer I would hope at harvest time there was something I and others might eat money isn't so tasty.

7825 2018-11-12 12:46:28 The problem is that the calculations for Barnett do not include Scottish products exported from English ports including whisky etc, it does not include all of the oil revenues so an adjustment has to be made to compensate but the compensation is small compared with the income.

7904 2018-11-12 12:36:44 Oil is formed from the remains of dead plants including marine algae that lived millions of years ago, even before dinosaurs. So... mostly tiny organism not giant beasts, there wouldn’t be the biomass.

7909 2018-11-12 12:36:18 What you're saying is a more nuanced argument than the "simply ban it" thread -the world is grey, not black and white. Another thing: Solomon Islands produces Palm oil more efficiently without eco destruction than anywhere else.

7921 2018-11-12 12:34:34 Palm oil not for thinking but for cooking 
7922 2018-11-12 12:34:27 Cruelty-free doesn't just mean no animal testing, if they use palm oil (which most of them do) then there's a good chance it comes from a place that profits off the destruction of fragile ecosystems and habitats for endangered animals.
7923 2018-11-12 12:34:26 As Californian I can say that as long as global warming is ignored by this oil industry lap dog president there will be more and more fires.  For every threat he issues about not helping a state in enduring disasters and in dire financial need he hastens his journey to Hell.
7924 2018-11-12 12:33:47 We need to retain a way to profitably invest, to preserve high risk, high pay careers like sports or offshore oil workers. Labour attacking UK sport would look tremendously bad.
7925 2018-11-12 12:33:44 LRT was really cute alright. Very well made too. And it's political the way all art is. But things are always going to be more complicated.

Deforestation did not start with palm oil and it will not end by banning palm oil.
7926 2018-11-12 12:33:41 It also doesn’t address how complex the issues with palm oil are. Simply banning it isn’t necessarily the best approach. Almonds, chocolate, coffee are all environmentally / ethically questionable too, but they don’t have the same focus, maybe in part due to Fair Trade labelling

7941 2018-11-12 12:31:39 A woman in 2Kings 4:1-7 was asked what she had in her house, she said nothing except a bottle of oil and that was what brought her out of poverty. God will not use something outside you to lift you. It is one thing you have on your inside that God will use to change your story.

7943 2018-11-12 12:31:29 Winters officially begin for me when the coconut oil freezes in the bottle itself
7944 2018-11-12 12:31:05 Secondly, when u left the government, $ was at 115 against PKR, it has now jumped to 130, so dont quote international oil prices vs local petroleum prices, thats not fair
7945 2018-11-12 12:31:04 Democrats and the truth are like oil and water.
7946 2018-11-12 12:31:03 why are you shilling a guy who lied about shorting oil to $8 and then deleted all evidence that he lied, as well as blocked everyone who called him out? please dont expose your followers, who trust you, to crooks
7947 2018-11-12 12:30:31 Anything with the use of palm oil in. I refuse to use.

7955 2018-11-12 12:29:42 Says the guy that is lecturing us from right next to the epic mess that is the Alberta tar sands debacle.  You do realize that the only reason that the tar is being extracted is because  the world is exhausting the easily exploitable reserves of  high-quality crude oil?
7956 2018-11-12 12:29:38 Sir weak analysis with respect to ur standards! I ll answer each of your point one by one. Firstly, with regards to oil, we always take the monthly average to compute petrol prices, since oil went down lately from $80 to $70, u cant use a single day price
7957 2018-11-12 12:29:35 おめでとう！
7958 2018-11-12 12:29:20 Had a bit of a panic yesterday when I read that vegetable glycerine is often made from Palm Oil - which I refuse to use.
Phew! It seems the vegetable glycerine I purchase is made from rapeseed oil.
Much relieved.

7968 2018-11-12 12:28:18 100% agree with the Iceland crimbo advert, however, the growing need for agricultural land is the biggest threat to forests and the species which live in them! Deforestation in general needs to stop, not just for palm oil x
7969 2018-11-12 12:28:18 What are you smoking? That bastard started a fake oil war and dropped chemical weapons on civilians. He created the terrorists over oil. He and his son are war criminals. There is nothing honorable to his actions.
7970 2018-11-12 12:28:16 Yep it is. How bout pastels? Have you tried them? Oil and soft?
7971 2018-11-12 12:28:10 Natural gas (if available in large enough quantities) could be collected from the oil operations in Turkana and used in gas turbines. Much cleaner than heavy oil or coal. Plus, much lower footprint with gas turbines due to much higher power density than plants like Kipevu
7972 2018-11-12 12:28:00 Galchenyuk is now 3G-5A-8PTS in 9 games after a 1G 1A performance last night. He is the oil for our powerplay machine, defensive when he needs to be, and individually skilled enough to be a 1st line center in the NHL. Domi is finding success but I'd still do this deal 10/10 times
7973 2018-11-12 12:27:54 From media: Saudi Arabia sent oil prices climbing today after announcing that it’s ready to cut production.

7979 2018-11-12 12:27:35 @XiaAhmad1 You are right sir. Barani research institute chakwal has been providing free olives to the locals and related facilities to enhance production in potential waste lands. But the prevailing problems they and farmers have been facing is its production into oil.
7980 2018-11-12 12:27:29 I have stopped all palm oil products for some time now

7989 2018-11-12 12:27:04 Great article.  We need a #Thoriumnuclear reactor by each city to power our homes and vehicles. The scale of the void when we stop oil is huge&understated.This is new tech reactors with no water coolung required. Its safer cheaper&the fuel is abundant.We need to embrace it.
7990 2018-11-12 12:26:52 Also shows how lucky the Tories got for the 2015 election to fall during the only period of real wage growth in a decade.
Without the oil/fracking price wars driving down inflation for that period, we probably wouldn't have brexit right now.

7998 2018-11-12 12:25:46 India's energy security & sustainable economic growth is massively undermined by fossil imports; oil, LNG & coal. Electrification reduces oil imports, but raises coal use. Reducing thermal coal imports is a key policy, being replaced by RE, EE but also domestic coal. Complicated!

8019 2018-11-12 12:22:16 you know nothing about oil! The cost varies from oilfield to oilfield! You are speaking like you are selling   !
8020 2018-11-12 12:22:11 When necessary - but a realist most of the time. Growing rapeseed means less food crops and the yield of rapeseed oil is 1190gal/ha compared to 5950gal/ha for palm oil. This is avoiding one problem while creating another.
8021 2018-11-12 12:22:10 Apparently HSBC have $18 Billion invested in palm oil plantations & production. That's just one bank. Now you know.

8023 2018-11-12 12:21:47 They both are. Several banks have been fined gold fix manipulation in the past few years. Although I don't think gold is as manipulated. Seems gold is manipulated downwards...but never to the upside. Whereas oil, it seems to be more of a tug-of-war moving prices up and down.
8024 2018-11-12 12:21:45 Same oil money, different brains. Not the same. One run by consistently atrophied desubstantiated brains, the other by normal humans with well developed brains.

8028 2018-11-12 12:21:13 @realDonaldTrump You have allowed Iran to sell crude to 8 countries, more they advise Opec+ to cut output for price increase. I'm 100% sure that US can successfully replace oil export on those 8 countries. Who steals America, Iran, Saudi Arabia or you. YOU.

8032 2018-11-12 12:20:43 What is your problem with Venezuela? I thought you were wiser than this? Why are you so backward? Is oil the only resources that Nigeria has? Even without oil, Nigeria can survive! So why all these senseless comparison of Venezuela with Nigeria all the time?
8033 2018-11-12 12:20:42 Before I started having these carb withdrawals it sounded gross and now i just want it with a ton of heavy whipping cream. And i want to eat coconut oil the way i like to eat peanut butter out of the jar. Its so weird

8043 2018-11-12 12:19:59 3. In the middle of the ocean, vessel carrying exported oil from Kenya, makes a u-turn, heads back to the port of Mombasa. 

4. Oil is received by port authority as imported crude oil from Saudi Arabia, tax is levied. 

 .
8044 2018-11-12 12:19:54 @Liquadate we are the biggest producer of crude oil in the world. So I'm gonna guess that they buy oil from us so ya.
8045 2018-11-12 12:19:32 Wouldn't a petition to get all companies to scrap Palm Oil be more beneficial?
8046 2018-11-12 12:19:25 Kenya is the first country in the world to import Oil from herself   

1. Oil leaves Turkana by Road. (Why not build a refinery in Turkana to avoid unnecessary logistical costs).

2. Oil arrives at the port of MOMBASA, leaves for the Indian Ocean going to where no one knows.
8047 2018-11-12 12:19:19 I'm long oil, GBP and EUR and none are looking too great. Also short yen but that's also not really working right now
8048 2018-11-12 12:19:16 Darren Kennedy was running out of money and ideas so he created a product that no one needed and the Irish media swallowed it Hook line and sinker, promoting his rebranded Oil Of Olay for free & saving his meaningless public persona.
8049 2018-11-12 12:19:16 Singapore produces less than 7,000 barrels of Oil daily, yet Singapore has the Largest refinery in the World. Singapore  is the 4th best Nation in the world. Nigeria produces 2.4 million barrels daily, paradoxically Nigeria imports fuel from Singapore today.

8052 2018-11-12 12:18:58 Why look only at replacing palm oil with vegetable oils? My example: pork pie; pork, lard, flour.. No need for any veg oils. Not all biscuits need to be vegan, some can use butter or lard. Ditto bread can be made with lard. Crazy: mix of Palm/rapeseed oil in all processed foods.
8053 2018-11-12 12:18:54 Got some mct oil coming in from amazon tomorrow, gonna try that butter coffee stuff
8054 2018-11-12 12:18:28 So you would flush away the brain trust because of republicans being complicit/spineless? Fire Dems too? that’s like firing the only mechanic in the shop that knows how to put the plug back in after an oil change.There’s new faces in the house give them a time to learn the job.
8055 2018-11-12 12:18:08 These are the effects of climate change, the systematic, decades-long denial of which has diminished our chances of mitigating it greatly - if not completely. You can thank the GOP, Putin and the oil cabal as hurricanes flatten a new island or coastal area several times a year.
8056 2018-11-12 12:18:05 I feel the same. But for oil. Like those things are evil. And they take so long to dry.
8057 2018-11-12 12:18:05 Pray for years to come the price of oil will not fall. If not then ringgit will fall together. Doesn't take rocket scientist to figure that out.
8058 2018-11-12 12:17:42 The majority of state attorney general seats are now blue.... @HuffPostPol

8065 2018-11-12 12:16:53 Yes. And that's why we believed oil would last forever, science would save us from our excesses, and we needn't alter our behaviour one bit for things to improve endlessly. Now they're not. Some things are wishful thinking
8066 2018-11-12 12:16:46 hmmm liquid paraffin? I think it's for very dry and dry skin only. I use a cream with it when my dry patches get particularly severe, but I wouldn't put it anywhere else on the face. If you had any adverse reactions to mineral oil, liquid paraffin may cause them too.

8068 2018-11-12 12:16:37 US stock futures are flat with Asia higher and Europe lower. Oil is higher to $60.49 with gold at $1,207.  It would be a great day to start the Christmas rally in the markets!
8069 2018-11-12 12:16:28 Oil is due for a bounce? Long US inflation here

8071 2018-11-12 12:16:02 This is exactly what I've been thinking since the advert came out, I really hope misinformation doesn't ruin an amazing chance to educate people about the realities of palm oil, and how its use sustainably is what we need
8072 2018-11-12 12:15:55 食パンさんお疲れ様です！
8073 2018-11-12 12:15:50 Not sick of the world, but I am sick of the people running it, sick of the greed, sick of the wars for oil, sick of this government being run by corporations, sick of Murdock choosing who will be our next Prime Minister.
8074 2018-11-12 12:15:31 Saudi Arabia annunced it will slash its oil exports unilaterally next month - by 500K barrels per day - as OPEC producers met over the weekend to halt a market slump that had seen crude decline by 20% since early October.

8075 2018-11-12 12:15:30 It's interesting the products that palm oil is in.  I bought a car on 'luxury confectionary with no added sugar and gluten free.  The first ingredient is palm oil ('from a sustainable source') and despite the  mint flavour the whole product tastes of oil, not pleasant.

8084 2018-11-12 12:14:26 Thank you, I appreciate these answers. What does physically certified mean? Will you have easily recognisable labelling on your products to show this? Does it apply to all your range of products? What palm oil are you using in the meanwhile?
8085 2018-11-12 12:14:21 It's hard to find stuff without palm oil.   Let ys all know what you find? X
8086 2018-11-12 12:13:49 I thought these two countries are the ones who're supposed to ban the ad!

Malaysia and Indonesia are lobbying to the EU to stop discrimination against palm oil
8087 2018-11-12 12:13:47 My experience with tea tree oil wasn't good. But yeah use it diluted with water.
Almond oil is great for super dry skin. Massage daily once a day. And aloe vera twice a day.

8089 2018-11-12 12:13:45 @Jacobs_IRL I just ate 2 Tuc cheese biscuits.  However the label says it contains palm oil, so I won't be buying them again until you change the recipe
8090 2018-11-12 12:13:26 No problem. As there is no requirement to include on our packaging that we use sustainable palm oil and due to lack of space on pack, this is not currently declared.  More info can be found on the RSPO website - our RSPO member number is 4-0022-07-000-00. Thanks!
8091 2018-11-12 12:13:13 Agli americani non importava se erano dittature o democratici, a loro interessava solo il petrolio, non lo so se sai del programma Oil for food che obbligava gli iracheni ad offrire il petrolio in cambio di cibo, questa è la democrazia?

8093 2018-11-12 12:13:09 I feel bad for people who don't have first accounts cause they gotta block y'all to not be spoiled 
8094 2018-11-12 12:13:08 Go away. Some people depend on palm oil, so banning it from your stores is not helpful. Why not invest in the sustainable production of it instead?
8095 2018-11-12 12:13:00 Same here. This is a very tough hold!.
8096 2018-11-12 12:12:59 ひえええ……

8100 2018-11-12 12:12:43 Bcoz oil was up from lows and oil fall was already factored whn market bounced from 10000. BTW OMCs and airlines are already 25-30% from their lows

8113 2018-11-12 12:10:57 Merkel was negotiating with Putin to purchase billions in oil from Russia while Trump was at NATO conference. Trump confronted her & Merkel quit. Why should we pay our share of NATO & others too & protect them from 'their enemy, Russia" when they are negotiating w/them.

8221 2018-11-12 11:57:42 I’m not a scientist so cannot answer that but there must be alternatives! The trouble is palm oil is high yielding and is so versatile it is used used in so many products.  If consumer demand reduces then companies will be forced to find a more sustainable substitute.

8251 2018-11-12 11:51:45 Definitely! Although I'm not vegan I've just been checking the food in my cupboards and it's crazy how many brands use a different name for palm oil in the ingredients
8252 2018-11-12 11:51:32 Speculation, Russia is not going to invade Europe, they can't afford it. Putin had a deal with Merkel to sell Germany billions in oil, but Trump effectively stopped it by confronting Merkel. Germany won't pay full amnt to NATO but wants our protection while they deal with enemy.
8253 2018-11-12 11:51:29 It’s not about grandstanding you cretin. It’s about information on how our planet/animals are being sacrificed for the sake of palm oil growth. It’s about choice, you can either watch it and take note or you don’t. It’s that simple.

8310 2018-11-12 11:43:24 Its not about palm oil. Its about allowing 3rd parties to place adverts through other organisations. If we allow this we are going the way of american attack ads. Do we really want to uncork that bottle?

8326 2018-11-12 11:41:33 Why can't any scientist make oil from a plant? Your starting a guess as fact. Much evidence is showing oil comes from the inner earth core.  Oil found deep under oceans and 4 billion old rock comes from dinasours? Your an idiot to believe that.
8327 2018-11-12 11:41:17 I’ve actively avoided palm oil for years now. I’m glad companies are willing to boycott it now, too. Why the notion of protecting our planet and not killing helpless animals en masse is considered “political” is beyond me.

8332 2018-11-12 11:40:42 Very big one. They come out looking like fire wood pot that palm oil was rubbed on. Very irritating 
8333 2018-11-12 11:40:39 The shale oil phenomena is incredibly unique in the context of American free enterprise and capitalistic idealism. It does not rely on its product prices to be sustainable, only low interest, abundant capital to borrow. Example: it has hardly ever in a decade been profitable.

8347 2018-11-12 11:39:06 Reasons to buy $oil
*Iran sanction
*OPEC production cut
*Winter season
*60=low risk

Reasons to fear
*Manipulation going to this bearish option expiration month (big bear money still in)
*technical =algos are in sell mode
*Pres.trump bashing any min

8360 2018-11-12 11:37:37 As citizens we should demand public disclosure of the domestic debt and term sheets of Afreximbank facilities we are acquiring for RTGS balances convertibility . Public confidence is paramount to any reform process anything 2 e contrary will be snake oil.

8393 2018-11-12 11:33:58 @DavidNdii You should assist us to investigate why Kenya exports crude oil yet it's plausible to refine it at Changamwe for domestic consumption.
8394 2018-11-12 11:33:22 I bought a lip oil and that shit has been a god send for my lips. They are soooo soft and hydrated.
8395 2018-11-12 11:33:16 Hi there, April, this is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
8396 2018-11-12 11:33:03 At 3,000 miles, it's important to take your vehicle to Crescent Service to have your oil changed as well as your tire treads and air pressure checked. Also check these: under-hood fluid levels and wiper blades.
8397 2018-11-12 11:32:57 If ever he wants public confidence,  There has to be audit of domestic debt , Zamco and publish the results, term sheets  for facilities he is securing from Afreximbank shld be published,  anything to the contrary is snake oil.

8399 2018-11-12 11:32:41 Check your products' labels. If it has palm oil listed - put it back on the shelf. There's a substitute for a few more pennies.
8400 2018-11-12 11:32:41 I avoid palm oil for that reason but it's practically in everything. Disgraceful.

8403 2018-11-12 11:32:18 You can get sustainable palm oil. It’s the palm oil that does not say sustainable that is the problem!

8415 2018-11-12 11:30:37 But are you willing to stop buying products that contain palm oil? Watching and sharing a cute ad is easy… 
8416 2018-11-12 11:30:35 Of course it’s political, big business is killing some of the most beautiful animals in the world for profit and hiding what products have palm oil in. Kudos to @IcelandFoods for making the advert, I’ll continue to share in and revisit my buying habits as a result

8427 2018-11-12 11:29:12 Ifbthem have sense this motorway be very easy to fix. If you check the road e be concrete slabs. Temporary solution, take off the broken slabs one at a time and replace them. Patching with asphalt is like mixing water and oil. It doesn’t make any sense.
8428 2018-11-12 11:29:01 Sorry man. In the 10 years I’ve known you... this is the first time I’ve seen you this upset about the oilers.  Hang in there... we will turn this ship around.
8429 2018-11-12 11:29:00 This is just an advertisement for palm oil 
This doesn't help orangutan in any way. They are shot if they venture into palm oil plantations in search of food. You are trying to create a demand for so called sustainable palm oil but it's history is forest & animal death

8431 2018-11-12 11:28:48 Products containing palm oil should be labelled clearer, shampoos, chocolate spreads preferably in large red letters, I’m sure people wouldn’t buy them especially when there’s alternatives containing no palm oil, NO animals should their homes sabotaged. It’s truly very sad.
8432 2018-11-12 11:28:33 The ad, It’s brilliant, Wakes everyone up including vegans that still use palm oil products..banning it was genius.....

8438 2018-11-12 11:28:05 As long as everyone realises that if you halt palm oil production you create an economic crisis for the indigenous peoples who can't feed/educate their kids without that income. They are not ignorant of damaged caused but they are out of options. So let's help them too. Please.

8459 2018-11-12 11:25:01 UK foreign aid should go towards saving the forests, because it's hard to lecture to Palm  Oil producers, from our country where we cleared our forest covered nation to produce farmland, #jeremyvine
8460 2018-11-12 11:25:01 God what's happening here 
8461 2018-11-12 11:24:57 Kate, don't forget that while meeting with NATO, Merkel was negotiating a deal with Puting for oil, billions. Yet she & the others still expect us to protect them and pay our share and theirs. Europeans are nationalist but they hide under Socialism, they are out for themselves.
8462 2018-11-12 11:24:57 I can't understand quite why this twat is taken seriously.  Nothing he says is thought through is yet sucked up presumably because he looks and speaks as if he might be knowledgeable. He is a modern day smoke and mirrors, snake oil salesman in a Saville Row suit.
8463 2018-11-12 11:24:54 Gotta get an oil change today and i have a dr appt at 9:45! Hope the roads ain’t bad 
8464 2018-11-12 11:24:26 How? China is already buying oil in  CNY/Gold. And expanding it to other commodities. And what if Chinese exporters tell buyers to settle in CNY? Outside of the US, the trade balance of China with RoW is fairly balanced

8469 2018-11-12 11:23:55 Hi Sonja, this is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
8470 2018-11-12 11:23:52 If oil is made from dinosaur fossils and plastic is made from oil does that mean plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs
8471 2018-11-12 11:23:47 Yes good. Also peanut oil is ok. 
The best thing to cook with is butter.
Grass fed butter.
8472 2018-11-12 11:23:42 It was banned because so many companies use palm oil and Iceland are throwing them all under the bus, making them look bad which is bad for their business

8475 2018-11-12 11:23:26 Totally horrified and shocked. Went to @Icelandfoods this morning to buy palm free biscuits and cake. Well guess what all their biscuits and cake contain palm oil and derivatives. Except a couple of butter biscuits. I wont be back #PalmOilFreeChristmas
8476 2018-11-12 11:23:18 Most people have never heard of palm oil.

8518 2018-11-12 11:16:38 I'm still struggling to see your objection to a palm oil boycott. Is it perhaps, a similar argument I use against veganism that the high welfare farms are likely to suffer most due to their size?
8519 2018-11-12 11:16:29 ありがとうございますーーーwwwwwwwwww
8520 2018-11-12 11:16:10 No, but the trade stats in the economic survey contain both the crude palm oil and the edible oils export data—that could give an indication.  Don’t think its that high though, the neighboring countries domestic processing has been catching up.
8521 2018-11-12 11:16:07 Forex is definitely one of the factors in the model. The analysis, however depends heavily upon oil and non oil imports and the impact that a change in value of the rupee has on the volumes (assuming short run volume adjustment to be minimal for non-oil imports and none for oil)
8522 2018-11-12 11:16:06 Thanks for your reply. Is there a logo for sustainable palm oil that you could put on your labels to make it clearer? Thanks again

8556 2018-11-12 11:12:36 I am surely getting one. Not a certain palm oil looking one.
8557 2018-11-12 11:12:26 tila ako newbie sa oil pastel ah kaasar
8558 2018-11-12 11:12:24 I have always suspected this. Indeed in the cooking oil industry, we import raw palm oil, process it & export finished product. I have read an industry report which claimed that we export 60% of the cooking oil processed in Kenya. Doc, do you have verified numbers of this?
8559 2018-11-12 11:12:16 Today @MBuhari is attacked for working to recover an already battered economy inherited. He and @ProfOsinbajo are not sharing any oil blocks or arranging kick backs but working to build the nation and provide for the ordinary Nigerian. The SIP was designed for ordinary Nigerians.
8560 2018-11-12 11:12:00 If it says vegetable oil chances are it's palm oil. So make sure it says something specific like sunflower oil etc.
8561 2018-11-12 11:11:51 Who ever this Andy bloke is holds a very uneducated view!! I’ve been to Borneo and seen first hand what the palm oil industry is having on the rainforest (which we need to breath by the way!!) and to its inhabitants!!!! I think he needs do some research and be less Trump like!!

8563 2018-11-12 11:11:27 No worries mate. Something that helps mine is after I shower I put baby oil on. Works really well. Also try Aveeno moisturiser its very good
8564 2018-11-12 11:11:18 But everyone is seeing it anyway via social media. I'd rather see conversations about sustainable palm oil, than about whether the ad should have been banned. My worry is that peoples's outrage is placed against the ban, rather than against palm oil deforestation.

8566 2018-11-12 11:10:51 Okay. Maybe in north India where roti invariably has a lot of ghee or oil. It's not the case here. Chapatis are non oily here. If you ask them to put butter or ghee or oil on top then it's a different matter.

8569 2018-11-12 11:10:24 It's a weird thing with oils. Some are called what the oil is for: motor oil. Some are called what it is: coconut oil. Some are ambiguous but obvious from context: baby oil. But I saw "beard oil" in the grocery store. I'm clueless.

8573 2018-11-12 11:09:55 It’s scary how many products contain palm oil @GilesClark78
8574 2018-11-12 11:09:48 And that absolutely includes companies too! If Iceland can afford to remove palm oil from their products, why can't other supermarkets do it too? 
8575 2018-11-12 11:09:38 No. I liked the advert. All supermarkets need to look at the produce with Palm oil content and seek to remove it.
8576 2018-11-12 11:09:35 Get some eyelash remover or they say oil helps loosen the glue
8577 2018-11-12 11:09:21 @JuliaBradbury just caught #thismorning thanks for your continued support of both our removal of plastic and palm oil. We are not opposed to palm oil, but until the industry cleans up its act and stops deforestation we will not use it as an ingredient in our own brand food
8578 2018-11-12 11:09:21 It’s a great ad and I’d love to give up palm oil but it’s in EVERYTHING

8596 2018-11-12 11:06:16 Should have pointed out that if Iceland REALLY cared about the palm oil issue they would have produced their own advert rather than running one they KNEW might not get approval because of it's Greenpeace links.

8606 2018-11-12 11:05:19 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
8607 2018-11-12 11:05:02 @BillBailey so many people I know have shared this video and good job, too. The EU are looking to ban palm oil in biofuels: The UK don’t look to be signing up - hardly surprising with Gove. Malaysia are threatening to pull a big defence contract with the UK if we do.
8608 2018-11-12 11:04:57 @JeremyVineOn5 The company that banned the #rangtan ad are funded by HSBC who have £18 billion invested in palm oil.
8609 2018-11-12 11:04:57 #FTSE  disappointing performance especially with futures having been so bullish but its the relationship with the £ that is cause for concern... if really should be making more headway with falling sterling and rising oil... Guess its now up to the US to re invigorate the bulls.
8610 2018-11-12 11:04:47 But oil spills do occur in shipping business.
8611 2018-11-12 11:04:45 Iceland "has worked with its suppliers to replace palm oil with substitutes such as rapeseed and vegetable oils" - so it's simply shifting the problem elsewhere. Any plant-based replacement is bad for the environment.

8617 2018-11-12 11:04:08 Oil? Would rather see us invest in electric infrastructure for cars than oil. Scotland needs to think progressively about how it uses technology rather than the age old oil argument anyhow. To do that and become a tech hub, you need to create the right environment for investment

8625 2018-11-12 11:03:18 $XOP not chasing this open today. OPEC hype should cause a little upmove, but I think just the fact they are admitting cuts are needed suggests that the oil market isn't in a good place right now and the decline could continue when the cut "high" wears off. Not shorting either.

The market, last week closed up with large cap stocks in the Consumer goods and Oil & Gas sectors like NESTLE and SEPLAT recording gains. We envisage that pockets of sell-offs across counters which gained last week will see the market close down this week.
8662 2018-11-12 10:58:56 Thank you  I have been checking products for palm oil all weekend! #nopalmoilchristmas
8663 2018-11-12 10:58:53 As fear gripped crude oil markets last week, and with dire predictions running rampant, it was easily to see the next move.

The next move came yesterday as Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih announced production would ease by 500,000 barrels per day.

The move before the move
8664 2018-11-12 10:58:41 I don't think this advert should be banned. But we should be aware that alternatives many companies use so that they can say they aren't palm oil free aren't much better. Palm oil best avoided but soya (milk/sauce/edamame) prob worse for the planet.

8669 2018-11-12 10:57:36 Un piccolo consiglio. Utilizzala con qualche goccia di tea tree oil se hai qualche brufoletto persistente. Proprietà astringenti e disinfettanti del tea tree oil e nutrienti della crema fanno si che la pelle attorno al brufolo non si secca. Ottima scelta complimenti.
8670 2018-11-12 10:57:32 Our corrupt excuse of a government don't want awareness of the palm oil deforestation plight as it might affect their arms sales in Malaysia.
8671 2018-11-12 10:57:31 I think he made a big mistake in falling for Eddie Jones’ snake oil, and being naive enough to allow himself to be quoted saying he feels more English than Scottish.  Can’t help but agree with him - Sam Skinner feels more Scottish than Gary Graham.
8672 2018-11-12 10:57:30 I expect that @realDonaldTrump's #IranSanctions will have countereffects. Just think about #Iraq that is (for now) heavily depending on #Iran #oil. Trump could drive #Baghdad more to the #Iranians and #Russians. #US will then loose a major oil supplier that is not for now.
8673 2018-11-12 10:57:18 When you observe all the humanitarian wars they claim fight is usually directed toward regions endorsed with oil resources so that say it all is a mean to satisfy their hunger to these resources while leaving huge distraction

8725 2018-11-12 10:50:24 How about using an alternative to palm oil all together even if it means it’s couple of pence more expensive. With the growth of the human population and therefore consumption, sustainable sources are becoming questionable.
8726 2018-11-12 10:50:13 Only going to get worse, City breaking FFP means the other big teams and arsenal have to spend more to catch up. The rest of the league don’t have that kind of money.

8728 2018-11-12 10:50:05 Antonino, you're a small-scale, Fairtrade, luxury chocolate producer. You cannot, and should not, speak on behalf of 'the agricultural sector'. If you believe palm oil production is largely benevolent, you've been living under a rock for the past 20 years. Please read more.
8729 2018-11-12 10:50:01 Closing Bell - Weak global markets and rise in oil price on concerns of production cut dragged the market below 10,500 level. Sensex closed at 34,812.

8731 2018-11-12 10:49:44 Don't know bout you lot but if Manchester City where labouring in mid table no one would give a toss about oil money or corruption,there are plenty of other clubs earning more than them,does that mean they are all on the fiddle?
8732 2018-11-12 10:49:28 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
8733 2018-11-12 10:49:06 Vote with your feet, shop at Iceland and you won't be supporting the palm oil industry.
8734 2018-11-12 10:48:36 I see the ref to climate change ;) at the ICDPPC side event, an ad industry rep referred to data as essential to the ad industry as oil is to the energy sector - I commented that in that case, the ad industry had reached its climate change crisis moment. Time for change

8739 2018-11-12 10:47:55 REQUEST/SUGGESTION to my data, graphics and cartography friends: can anyone produce a world cartogram that scales country size with oil consumption or total energy consumption? And perhaps shows how the distribution of energy consumption has changed over time?
8740 2018-11-12 10:47:48 @chesterzoo have made the most valid point. This is not about a ban but ensuring SUSTAINABLE palm oil production that protects the rainforest.
8741 2018-11-12 10:47:40 Good morning @ChrisMo05483074 I think that is you and based on the cycle drinks bottle oil catcher on the right hand side if the rear engine plates, I would guess it’s 1985? Filtrate sponsored and a short front mudguard! #totalguess

8754 2018-11-12 10:46:31 Respect to @thismorning highlighting Iceland's Band Christmas Ad. The reason the ad is band is because they know its not good for business and people would refuse to buy palm oil products. However, the rain forest is still destroyed for the beef industry.

8807 2018-11-12 10:39:02 I never saw so much mixed signals on #crude #oil as today. Russian export seems as live in their own world and probably their supply requirements based on Iran direct delivery failure. So cut made by Saudis should be enough. Meanwhile last inverted hammer was fake, another seen.
8808 2018-11-12 10:38:58 SAUDI ARABIA is a responsible country, and it cares about the international community not to be affected by high rise prices of oil..

8810 2018-11-12 10:38:40 Hi Michael! The reason for adding rapeseed oil to some of our oat drinks is that we want to offer an oat drink with a balanced, good composition of protein, fat and carbohydrates.>

8812 2018-11-12 10:38:22 Didn't have any response to that beyond implying I'm stupid did you. Your usual level of debate. By the way any time you get in a car a plane or anything that uses oil who do you think the money for that is going to? We're all complicit in some shit one way or another.

8869 2018-11-12 10:30:09 When the oil is extracted from the almonds the remains should be used for animal feed but unfortunately the greedy farmers package them for sale without giving this info.  Cheating and dishonesty has come their way of life and on top crying their eyes out for waving their loans.
8870 2018-11-12 10:30:06 Yikes.  
That's my biggest problem pia. Oil control I have learnt but because you're saying I will look like an oil ball . Now if most of these foundations have red undertones.  
8871 2018-11-12 10:30:03 Indeed. We will have to start looking into things more deeply before we choose what to buy. Palm oil is apparently better than many alternative crops so it will be worth the bother to find sustainable alternatives.
8872 2018-11-12 10:29:55 Bitumen is useless until refined, so no surprise that oil that’s more pure and needs less refining commands a higher price

8880 2018-11-12 10:28:08 certified, yes - so I will look out for certification, seems palm oil is in nearly everything now, but doesn't always specify that it is sustainable unfortunately.
8881 2018-11-12 10:28:07 Nothing to do with the post brexit plan to massively increase the palm oil trade with Indonesia past the point of sustainability then?  THATS why it’s political

I had no idea about what using palm oil was doing to the world. We need more awareness and the rules are wrong.
8885 2018-11-12 10:27:45 My solution to the paper looking like oil hit it in one corner of where the watercolour is: add a bunch of stars in gold ink to cover it up. Gold makes everything better. Maybe. Hopefully.

8900 2018-11-12 10:25:04 @AndyWestTV I get your point but I also feel you’re just trying to be a little controversial we should be stopping using things with palm oil as this is destroying our planet and orangutans!

8914 2018-11-12 10:21:31 I thought that but here's another take..

The University of Kent says:

"Iceland's move to ban palm oil products, rather than work with the industry to seek sustainably-sourced solutions, could be viewed as a step backwards...."
8915 2018-11-12 10:21:27 Sir my sense is this would a dead cat bounce, will fizzle out between 73.5 to 74. The premiums are too high between wti crude oil and #brentoil which will make it unsustainable. 65 to 67 is a level seen on brent and lower further to 56 to 58.

8984 2018-11-12 10:10:51 It's just Greenwashing. There is no such thing as 100% sustainable palm oil They give out 'certification' to plantations that are on land that once was rainforest. They just have to wait a couple of years then they get passed. It's a scam 
8985 2018-11-12 10:10:51 Palm oil is healthy. But right now, the destruction of rainforest to produce palm oil has to be stopt. Once meat is history, we have enough free land to grow everything in abundance and can restore all important habitats for wildlife.
8986 2018-11-12 10:10:49 What the hell is CBD oil, where has it come from, why do people keep banging on about it? I've got a cold - use CBD oil. I can't sleep - CBD oil. I've cut my head off with a rusty butter knife - yep CBD oil. Urgh fad-tastic

8996 2018-11-12 10:08:57 That’s still up to the government (to me they would do that if the oil price isn’t enough to sustain themself because they might actually losing the supermajors (they can’t extract & refine it themself) if they do it).
8997 2018-11-12 10:08:48 Unsustainable palm oil, and lashings of it.
8998 2018-11-12 10:08:47 What is this world coming 2??surely the British government has common sense that "fracking" is extremely dangerous & it's potentially detrimental to the environment, weakening land structure,polluting under water systems just 4a little oil & to attack oil prices how SHAMEful!

1,Volatility. 
2,Bulk Transportation  (focus on export not local market) requires Ocean. 
3,Corruption

9017 2018-11-12 10:05:40 As can be seen at the first link I posted, they increased the taxes  even more than what was required to meet the revenue figures they would get had prices of oil not decreased in the first place. Can't see any reason to not criticise that.

9039 2018-11-12 10:01:46 Totally agree @Clearcast is way out of line hear. This smacks of censorship of course uncomfortable truths, it begs the question is there any “leaning on them” by those with vested interest in Palm oil ? One hopes not, but it is worrying that they think @Greenpeace is political
9040 2018-11-12 10:01:44 Same boat. We are on the deck enjoying the ocean view. They are in the engine room cleaning oil and grease.
9041 2018-11-12 10:01:39 Na palm oil we discovered, na only god go punish our leader and they're generation.
9042 2018-11-12 10:01:33 Plantations on peat, yes. But plenty of oil palm grown on previously-developed land on mineral soil. A very efficient and productive use of that land. By @icelandfoods logic, they should also be banning soy, and should stop selling toilet paper.
9043 2018-11-12 10:01:13 Yes it's can be used for anything it's easy to get just grow a palm tree and collect the oil off it's leafs
9044 2018-11-12 10:00:59 Sorry but increasing taxes when prices went down is exactly what was criticised. They did not transfer the relief of lower oil prices to the masses. Generating revenue was not what was being debated. It's not difficult to generate revenue through indirect taxation.
9045 2018-11-12 10:00:49 Their population is like a local govt in Lagos alone roughly 2million or so, and very few tribes and differences between them.  Only one religion too. So when splitting the oil money there is less drama.

9060 2018-11-12 09:59:02 Yup, oil money and corruption plays the football on the pitch for them.
9061 2018-11-12 09:58:55 ... Getting good publicity for this move to eliminate palm oil and hopefully if people support them other supermarkets will see the benefits and follow suit.

9063 2018-11-12 09:58:35 Maybe it will force the issue of responsible labeling of palm oil.  Its currently so difficult to know what is ethically sourced and what isn't so I just do my best to avoid it as much as possible.

9095 2018-11-12 09:54:14 Hey Kelly it's CBD oil. Honestly works wonders. I've bought it before from health shops but the one Jaime sells is stronger and cheaper.
9096 2018-11-12 09:54:07 Isn't that part of the problem with palm oil though? This makes it very profitable so it replaces other important but less-profitable crops, sometimes leading to a shortage of staples.

There's little point having a sustainable option if consumers can't be certain the product they are buying is from such a source when they see palm oil in the ingredients

9122 2018-11-12 09:50:32 And another thing - although palm oil is bad for the environment, the alternatives are worse (lower oil yield per acre), so maybe getting rid of palm oil sounds good, unless we know what's being used in place of it, it doesn't tell the whole story.

9129 2018-11-12 09:49:32 Fully agree Sir. Oil is founding a bottom, at a time when Dollar is regaining strength, the  combo is back for India. Derivatives is the way to protect and prosper in such times for folks aware of the nuances of that mkt

9143 2018-11-12 09:47:38 Well if you use a lot of palm oil products you might just get one come to stay. That's the moral of the story... Right?
9144 2018-11-12 09:47:23 However, it was never Iceland’s intention to use its Christmas advert to support a political campaign – rather to raise awareness and solidify our position on not using palm oil in food production. Thanks, Pippa 2/2

9148 2018-11-12 09:47:07 Hi Catherine, the advert wasn’t approved by advertising regulators as it was seen to be in support of a political issue. The production and widespread usage of palm oil is a complex and sometimes controversial matter. 1/2

9153 2018-11-12 09:46:18 Like Venezuela, Iran, the world’s third largest oil producer, is hoping to leverage cryptocurrencies to compensate for the expected squeeze in petrodollars arising from the economic sanctions designed to stem oil exports from the country, the economy’s lifeblood.

9160 2018-11-12 09:44:52 Latin name for palm oil is Elaeis Guineensis. @IcelandFoods say :  “We’re removing palm oil from all our own label products”.

9165 2018-11-12 09:43:53 Oil industry is heavily invested in and employs a lot of people. So it will take time for the shift to happen to renewables, and big governments should take that move. But they won't as it might lead to wide scale unemployment and so on......

9172 2018-11-12 09:42:55 That would be a positive step. The development of palm oil in Asia was/is the main barrier to production in Africa, but the blame lies with big business and in turn the consumer wanting cheap! cheap! cheap!

So no more Cadburys chocolate for me @Greenpeace.
9265 2018-11-12 09:30:09 Maybe instead of spending the millions on the pomp and ceremony, we could support better our ex service personnel ? And we can remember the fallen every day ?

9295 2018-11-12 09:25:03 Secondly, the primary benefit of palm oil is to mass-market, corporate food manufacturers and retailers. Cheap fat = better mouthfeel to cheap products, longer shelflife = bigger profits. NOT in the consumer's best interest, nor the environment. Not sustainable, clearly.
9296 2018-11-12 09:25:02 A two-part quiz for future change-makers: a) how many items can you find in your house that contain palm oil? b) what’s the quickest you can find alternatives that are good for nature and you? @sophiehowe @tjgolding
9297 2018-11-12 09:24:56 Well INR wld have depreciated further if not for oil loosing 20%

9307 2018-11-12 09:23:29 the main cause of desfloration is not palm oil, it's definitely one of the causes but not the main one. The main one is animal agriculture, the reason why no one is talking about it is because that would implicate for the whole world to rethink their eating habits instead of

9309 2018-11-12 09:23:19 It’s a start, but it’s only on their own brand products, if they were serious about this, they’d ban any product containing palm oil.

9312 2018-11-12 09:22:53 You can't always avoid it. Palmoil/palm kernel oil is also used in:

* biofuel and energy
* animal feed
* pharma
* personal care and cosmetics.

Again, you have no way of knowing whether producers used palm or coconut oil.
9313 2018-11-12 09:22:40 I often add an anchovy with garlic oil to the base of a beef ragu, it gives it a salty, umamish flavour
9314 2018-11-12 09:22:36 Please read and educate yourself on the issue, Antonino. I've know for decades how bad palm oil is, it's NOW the rest of humanity is waking up. Almost too late.
9315 2018-11-12 09:22:19 Damn I wish I had enough money to buy a car lift, this would make my life a million times easier. oil changes and stuff would be so much more fun.

9317 2018-11-12 09:22:03 Fascinating history. The plant in the 18th Century was what crude oil is today. Huge wars were fought over the thing. 'Sir Joseph Banks and the Question of Hemp' a remarkable & brilliant read.

9323 2018-11-12 09:20:22 What would it be the alternative, considering the whole environment (farmers-industry-consumers)? Is all the palm oil effecting this issue? Have you considered those farmers that do the right thing and get dragged into a potential boycott?

9327 2018-11-12 09:19:59 CRUDE OIL has found the floor on Friday, at least for now, WTI has stopped at 59.50 USD (bounced off twice) and is now traded at 60.80 USD per barrel.
9328 2018-11-12 09:19:37 In US, nearly 70% of the demand for oil comes from transportation. With EVs entering mainstream, we cannot imagine how oil demand can remain unaffected. From 2019 energy will be buyers market.

9352 2018-11-12 09:16:08 Removing palm oil could have a greater environmental impact as for the amount of oil it produces it uses a lot less land than other forms of oil production.  It would be better to better regulate the industry than ban it outright.

9363 2018-11-12 09:14:09 @IcelandFoods you knew this ad would be banned and therefore you knew you could get free advertising via the general public. Clever. Also, people should know this is a much more complex issue than let’s ban palm oil, very complex and difficult.

9365 2018-11-12 09:14:04 So i said earlier there was no subsidy on base price of oil. If you think some subsidy on a small percentage of taxes compared to the usage rebated later with a lag is some achievement then bht acha kiya PMLN k. Great job.

9388 2018-11-12 09:11:13 Palm oil is classed as vegetable oil. The only solution is to use less of it as a whole, but it’s a cheap ingredient. Am not a fan, which is why I started baking at home but not everyone can/wants to do it.

9402 2018-11-12 09:08:34 Something like this maybe not too obtuse, or even just a small ‘This product does not use palm oil’ along the bottom. Checking the ingredients on every product isn’t ideal but I’m willing to do it for the rangers ;_;
9403 2018-11-12 09:08:18 Global warming is the responsibility of both parties. Reps on the side of oil, and Dems on the side of labor (esp cars). Taking bold steps against global warming would take a lot of courage for Dems, including alienating unions.
9404 2018-11-12 09:07:59 I think long term oil has still room to keep going down but I ll sure buy the bounce :)
9405 2018-11-12 09:07:19 So your saying on the front it should say. Palm oil from responsible source. Or something along those lines? Would definitely make it clearer.

9407 2018-11-12 09:06:53 Caprylic/capric trigylceride, for example can be made with coconut oil or palm kernel oil. If palm kernel oil is cheaper, then producers will use that instead of coconut oil. So it's really not simple for a normal consumer.

9410 2018-11-12 09:06:35 I do,  bro just because I added oil doesn't mean it was intentional, it was a typo.  You know u can make a good soup with 1500 period.
9411 2018-11-12 09:06:25 The only thing that has coal is living material mostly plants that's how coal got to earth.
Oil is organic material (carbon,hydrogen,oxygen) and the only thing that has those is living beings.

Sustainable palm oil production by local farmers will cut carbon, provide some social justice & protect biodiversity
9420 2018-11-12 09:04:51 Once more for those in the media who fell asleep down the back: @ScottMorrisonMP is not a marketer, he's not a marketer's bum. He's a snake oil salesmen.

9540 2018-11-12 08:48:02 It amazes me how much is used in this day and age. A quick look at the label and if it has palm oil just put it back.

9581 2018-11-12 08:40:59 It's not like a lot of the older political messages relied on much subtext either. "Drilling too deep for oil will lead to giant maggots and the world being on fire" isn't exactly a subtle hint at "industrial greed leads to environmental disaster".

9598 2018-11-12 08:37:22 @BBCBusiness 
Saudi cuts the oil price to keep the price artificially high is basically market manipulation. This shud not b allowed. I think it's exactly like the Libor market rigging. It's the same oil in the same barrel n costs the same to produce n process every month. Con!!!
9599 2018-11-12 08:37:22 Olive oil is the winner.
9600 2018-11-12 08:37:12 Why isn't the headline: "Dramatic reduction in Heart Attacks for African Americans with Fish Oil" ?! Clearlt that is the most important finding and would help to spread the word.
9601 2018-11-12 08:37:02 Whether it’s a Christmas ad or not is irrelevant. I think it’s informative  and really brings home how destructive the use of palm oil is to our World.
9602 2018-11-12 08:36:45 Well, I read an interesting article yesterday about the uk Govt pushing for more development if palm oil despite current EU directives against it.....coukd this be a factor in the “too political” ban?

9632 2018-11-12 08:32:07 And we said, what’s the worst thing they could do? And that would be sweeping down and deciding to take over all the oil fields.

9634 2018-11-12 08:30:58 Tragedy of #palmoil seems not only is there massive demand, by our out-of-control human population, for edible vegetable oils - palm oil is also used in things like detergents, soaps, cosmetics etc. which we use in excessive amounts.

9674 2018-11-12 08:24:27 Did you see the recent report arguing that banning palm oil would actually make matters worse? Because other types of veg oil, which require even more land, would have to be grown instead. An interesting & though provoking read.

9676 2018-11-12 08:24:24 I think we should have advertisements informing us where our products come from, to often we believe thay just appear on shelves and we are not aware of the enviromental impacts things like man made fibers and palm oil and Soya have.
9677 2018-11-12 08:23:27 Agreed. Welcome to Wild West. If only the snake oil sellers had social media in 1860s

9866 2018-11-12 07:52:10 This criminal cartel called #OPEC has been holding the world hostage for decades. Rest of the world needs to find a way to isolate and punish them, without somehow not impacting the oil prices greatly.
9867 2018-11-12 07:52:05 Sometimes I wonder how these guys reason.. A country that had no functional health sector during the period of oil boom for 16 years. The military era were better that PDP 16 years infrastructural wise. Was the UCH Ibadan not there for the entire 16 years reign?

I was part of the JIV team for the clean up exercise,these areas weren't visited nor listed in the impacted areas
9915 2018-11-12 07:44:41 It’s also in soap and makeup. But there’s two schools of thinking on it. One: all palm oil should be boycotted. Two: if we do that something else will have to take its place and that may be worse, so sustainable palm oil is better than boycotting.

9917 2018-11-12 07:44:26 I think you're missing the point. Palm oil can be sourced from sustainable plantations that have no impact on wildlife. The problem is it is often sourced from abundant natural habitats. Look at Unilever. They're committed to sustainable sources. Find out the source first.

9953 2018-11-12 07:38:51 Omg! That's a photo taken in Ohio of a oil refinery doing a emergency burn on a hazy/foggy night. It's old like a year old. These same idiots tried to use it  on a DEW attack in Michigan.
9954 2018-11-12 07:38:40 Iceland says: “UNTIL Iceland can guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction, we are simply saying ‘no to palm oil’. We don’t believe there is such a thing as ’sustainable’ palm oil available to retailers, so we are giving consumers a choice about what they buy.”
9955 2018-11-12 07:38:38 Oil companies are asking for protection from the #ClimateChange they help create.

10017 2018-11-12 07:23:50 I shared the ad and it’s ok. But then I read that CURRENTLY Iceland is among the worst of the main food outlets for palm oil products. M&S and Waitrose are doing much, much more. I support Iceland’s aspirations of course but perhaps I wouldn’t have shared it had I known.
