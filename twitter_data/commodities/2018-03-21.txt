48 2018-03-21 21:23:26 I would highlight the capitalism and the creation of people as commodities whose bodies/labor matters only in what it is "worth." I think older, deeper streams of many Western ethnic cultures do/did value their elderly.

51 2018-03-21 21:18:11 @realDonaldTrump will probably veto it seeing how he and his #DaddyVladdie view women as temporary conquests to be discarded like used up commodities.

54 2018-03-21 21:09:30 stocks, bonds, and commodities. There are $700+ trillion of assets that are going to have their ownership digitized on the blockchain. Currency use case isn't even interesting to me yet
55 2018-03-21 21:07:55 I agree he hasn't gotten everything right, and people have made more money through the us stock market than gold and commodities stocks, but I think he's one of the few people that see the bigger picture. I don't know just my opinion.

122 2018-03-21 17:13:45 Gregg Marshall let a kid out of his NLI so the kid could play for a conference opponent. Rare demonstration of some humanity and understanding in a competitive world where kids are too often seen as commodities and assets rather than human beings #WichitaState #Memphis
123 2018-03-21 17:13:32 The guidance for future interest rate hikes will be the most important information after today’s Fed rate hike. Hawkishness will kill commodities and equities.
124 2018-03-21 17:13:28 In first place i believe you should not let people make movies about your gods, it makes your gods more of commercial commodities when people make money out of their name.
125 2018-03-21 17:07:58 You’re also, I assume talking about individual securities. I’m talking about overall indices, commodities, currencies and rates. Incremental matter more than anything else in those cases. Agree individual stocks are very different
126 2018-03-21 17:07:52 Kevin - do they provide loadings by type, can you seperate crude oil form other commodities?  I'm guessing that would look rather dramatic.
127 2018-03-21 17:07:07 For those that can afford it but still won't go, can you blame them for the aversion? They read and hear about people dying cos of negligence in PHC, GHs, SHs even Nat'l hospitals. The queues, the series of OS commodities, the cost.
Even the very rich ones will rather travel out.
128 2018-03-21 17:05:09 look majority of agriculture outside of a few commodities are #Palestinian so they arent thriving in agro unless you count pesticides which Europe and the West & the East are resisting.

129 2018-03-21 17:02:09 Sir,you are right in your advice that Farmers will be able to enhance their incomes by adopting Integrated Farming System.Along with this, emphasis Needs toBe given on Creating maximum possible Cash Crops, Perishable Agricultural Commodities' Storage/ Warehouse Facilities.

135 2018-03-21 16:54:40 If there is a trade war, I do not believe it will have an impact on growers. American agriculture products are highly marketable and in great demand. A trade war is much more likely to effect other industries. Our commodities are second to none and are not dependent of exports.

174 2018-03-21 15:01:59 Futures prices reflect market expectations regarding future supply and demand conditions for non-storable commodities. For storable commodities with sufficiently large inventories, however, futures prices simply reflect the spot price plus carrying costs.

273 2018-03-21 07:15:40 This is in the US. The Bear is the totem animal of Russia. Americans get very touchy about our bald eagles--Russians feel the same about their bears.

277 2018-03-21 06:58:56 Of course women as commodities should remain available. There is no possibility them being traded as objects has anything to do with them being harmed as they are not viewed as human beings. It’s an objection to exploitation, not sex.

296 2018-03-21 04:48:16 This will give way to the most sordid and disgusting new scandal for Trump-his using women as commodities and his depravity in far greater ways than is known now.

309 2018-03-21 03:24:12 i can point to a dozen articles that refute. and a dozen that support it. I guess this result is a defence of a "property is a long term investment" argument. so many believed the commodities boom would "last a generation" how wrong we were.

332 2018-03-21 01:37:05 In the US/China trade tension, Saudi et al. could lose out.
