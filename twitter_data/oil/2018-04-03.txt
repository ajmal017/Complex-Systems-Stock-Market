44 2018-04-03 23:55:27 I agree. Really miss the lanewatch on my CTR after coming from a 15 Si coupe. Any plans for an oil catch can?
45 2018-04-03 23:55:16 My favourite "counter" to this trade from some Oil fans is that "Well, the team may not have drafted Barzal with that pick anyways!" as if that really makes things any better.

53 2018-04-03 23:53:15 So how about you just back the fuck up for a second? 
Let me ask you - is there enough production of alternative products right now to meet the needs of agriculture and manufacturing, that currently use oil and gas to run their vehicles and equipment? Is it local enough to

55 2018-04-03 23:53:02 I think the best way to view Hughes' work on this is as an informed and transparent critique of EIA's projections & assumptions. Not as a firm, independent forecast of shale gas/tight oil.

61 2018-04-03 23:51:44 I am asking because I truly do not know - is there enough production to meet demand if we shut down oil companies today? Could the production today, meet the demands of agriculture and manufacturing, that currently use oil products in their vehicles and machinery?

CA ranks first among the states in manufacturing.

CA is one of the leading mining states & produces a greater variety of mined products than any other. Oil is the number 1 product & we mine *all* of the boron in the USA.

86 2018-04-03 23:47:22 You truly made a fool of yourself today at the press briefing, such a disgrace. You need to talk to Nicki Haley and let her explain to you why the U.S. cannot “take” the oil from Iraq, Afghanistan, or anywhere. Your a bright one 
87 2018-04-03 23:47:20 do u normally add water to your pasta in the frying pan and let the water evaporate while you stir it or do you just fry the spaghetti in olive oil?

89 2018-04-03 23:47:16 Haha  another thing people don’t realize that I always try to remind them is that the pills will only absorb into your system if u take it w/ enough grams of fat, so every time I took them I also would eat a spoonful of coconut oil. It was gross but it was way more effective!

122 2018-04-03 23:42:39 Yes! I’ve had some acne from my rosacea and the lapis oil has cleared me up. I didn’t even get a breakout when my period came and I usually get one at least. I refuse to let that oil go from my routine
123 2018-04-03 23:42:23 Smothered myself in coconut oil and now I feel like I should be on vacation somewhere tropical.
124 2018-04-03 23:42:18 Hi balth. You forgot the worst oil spill in the Gulf EVER, and the major earthquake in Haiti! And we took a lot of people in, and didn't then force them OUT!
125 2018-04-03 23:42:14 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
126 2018-04-03 23:42:13 Sure we’ll have supply for decades to come, but I’m not convinced there will demand for oil in 200 years. We should sell it while we can...
127 2018-04-03 23:42:07 @EPAScottPruitt How can you sleep at night knowing you are polluting our planet. What kind of role model are you for public service emp., lobbyist interests, oil,gas CEO mtgs, low rent, raises for 2staff. YOU are NOT above the law.
128 2018-04-03 23:42:06 Give the Chavista thugs some credit: Expanding the enormous Drug Trade and countless other Mega-Scams is much easier and way more profitable than digging for heavy oil, planning and maintenance.

135 2018-04-03 23:41:25 Except we shouldn't "keep the oil" - it's their oil. They don't want us in Syria and it's illegal under international law for us to be there. But I support Trump in pulling out of Syria, I hope it happens. @realDonaldTrump
136 2018-04-03 23:41:22 I would do it after just to remove any remaining dirt/oil/impurities 

I usually do cleanser, then wipe a micellar water soaked cotton round, and then tone. Sometimes I mask before I shower and tone afterwards. I guess it depends on my routine lol
137 2018-04-03 23:41:13 Why should we trust you? All you do is support oil regardless of the actual total costs to Canadians in environmental damage and lost opportunities for newer cleaner technologies and the jobs they bring.
138 2018-04-03 23:40:42 Why are you doing this.  For the oil companies?  Makes no sense.  You have to be the worst EPA director ever.  Is this because Obama's name is on it?  Shameful.

156 2018-04-03 23:38:40 You mix it with equal parts water or ACV (apple cider vinegar). Generally people seem to get better results using the ACV, but if your skin is very sensitive use water as the mask might become a bit to intense. If I use water I just add a few drops of tea tree oil.

165 2018-04-03 23:36:44 Car’s in the garage, ran out of heating oil and the washing machine is broke.. I honestly think it’s cheaper to live in a cardboard box outside the chippy 
166 2018-04-03 23:36:40 Don’t you think it’s time someone checked on the collusion between the US government and big oil?
167 2018-04-03 23:36:32 I have an extra-stick pan for searing. It’s great! The key is to heat it up before adding oil.

173 2018-04-03 23:35:15 Didn't say, or think, that. Attacking Russia while being involved with other actions was Germany's downfall really. It would have played out differently and taken longer: who really knows? But not necessarily a German victory: their access to oil, for instance was very limited.
174 2018-04-03 23:35:03 this muscle milk lemon bar tastes like I'd imagine drinking tea tree oil would be like.

176 2018-04-03 23:35:02 there's alternatives for everything else, plant/alcohol based polymers and lubricants, renewable energy sources and storage, the supposed need for oil is a massive illusion

181 2018-04-03 23:34:03 Yah try do? We use coconut oil and tea tree oil
182 2018-04-03 23:33:57 You basically restated what you had previously so I will too. Industry vs association, NRA was founded to preserve second amendment rights. The oil and tobacco *industries* were founded to obtain and sell their product and protect only themselves.

184 2018-04-03 23:33:41 for oil i like the makeup forever mattifying one!
185 2018-04-03 23:33:41 Would be useful to add the pump price to the chart. Timing of increased taxes is perfect to offset lower oil prices.
186 2018-04-03 23:33:36 From the very day I saw you, I knew I found oil, baby girl you royal and I'm gone be loyal
187 2018-04-03 23:33:34 Oil doesn't work well for me, but thanks anyway.
188 2018-04-03 23:33:30 The global establisment & their proxy, western govts are still trying tarnish Putin to this day, & it's all to do with his involvement in Syria.
The real story is, the globalists want Syria, for its natural resources & allow the Saudis to lay an oil pipeline to Europe.

193 2018-04-03 23:32:47 Oil was discovered in Nigeria in 1956 and by the mid-1960's, we were already producing about 2 mill bpd.
Imagine if our leaders had recognized since then that our greatest asset was not oil itself but the resourcefulness of our ambitious youths.

201 2018-04-03 23:32:18 The name Castrol was derived from 'Castor Oil'. Funny how certain smells bring back a flood of memories.

204 2018-04-03 23:32:03 I thought the Vaseline story sounded like snake oil/copper bracelet/crystals type of nonsense, so I looked it up. Vaseline doesn't keep heat from escaping your body. It can, however, help protect your face from the wind by keeping moisture in. Cyclists use it frequently.
205 2018-04-03 23:31:51 Hmm very interesting! I don’t have a food processor though  glad it turned out good for you :) did you keep everything in the recipe or did you take things out? That fish oil stuff sounded nasty lmao

248 2018-04-03 23:24:53 I’m glad I no long have to pay $1 trillion on oil. But can you not flavor a statistic with a theory combined with an estimate? It’s already far enough away from a fact to be compounding figures to this degree.
249 2018-04-03 23:24:42 ++ 

It is now not funded, so it will hurt our state, which is not what we want.  

Even if they come up with the funding, it will probably be on the back of working people -- like cig taxes, motel taxes, etc.  When honestly, we should just make big oil pay it's fair share.

254 2018-04-03 23:23:23 I think oil and gas revenue ought to be budgeted using a 10 year rolling average. Never year to year. It would give Alberta a far more balanced expected revenue stream. The trick is to NOT spend foolishly in years when revenues are high.

'It's a gas', 'he's/she's a gas' meant funny, awesome, a riot - you know, right around the same time that I started taking photographs instead of doing oil paintings of shit... 
I was cool once (just after the Great Depression).
266 2018-04-03 23:21:42 I tried a butter + garlic powder + olive oil + parsley mix to make a quick version of garlic bread and honestly, a piece of toast has never been the same for me. I even just put it on some Ezekiel bread and my taste buds are very happy.

281 2018-04-03 23:19:29 If there is no market then why are you so worried? You still can’t give a credible response to the fact that these companies DONT gamble billions. They’ve done their market research. Oil demand is increasing and there is an increasing demand for heavy oil - with other heavy oil
282 2018-04-03 23:19:25 Most Hotels in state have low margins. We do not have opportunity to sell rooms for $200 a night or more like OKC.  Many hotels are small businesses. This is not the same as taxing a major corporate oil company.

289 2018-04-03 23:18:16 I spent three hours waiting to get my car worked on. Only half of that time was my car actually getting worked on. I got an oil change, wheel alignment, windshield wiper replacement, and new air filter. After that I found a geocache and came home to eat some delicious pork.
290 2018-04-03 23:18:14 Hi Hannah, do you mean the colorful one at the end of the gallery? That’s an oil painting by Birger Sandzen from 1927. It’s called “A Mountain Symphony/Longs Peak.”
291 2018-04-03 23:18:06 The west had only done those things to help you at the same time obtaining oil...which we pay you very well for. The U.S has fought for the freedom of middle east from terror. We get in return suicide bombings. Acid attacks, rapes, threats, PEOPLE like you, and sharia law
292 2018-04-03 23:17:58 I read an article where China has began paying for oil with the Yuan, Russia and China are looking at replacing the USA dollar as main payment source. If @realDonaldTrump pulls out of all trade agreements what will that do to our economy?
293 2018-04-03 23:17:31 Lol yasjay, they now have different tactics to tight it up back. Ask them
294 2018-04-03 23:17:28 How about tax the oil and gas companies at a competitive rate as other states and make the wealthiest Oklahomans pay their share of taxes too? Too much to ask to ask from a corrupt and paid off state legislature, I know.
295 2018-04-03 23:17:27 Roasted with olive oil, s&p, garlic powder works for me
296 2018-04-03 23:17:22 For tea tree oil I am loyal to The Body Shop.
297 2018-04-03 23:17:16 I'm so sick of this. I know #JerryBrown's a master manipulator and can talk Latin phrases and philosophy. But how can anybody think Brown is "green" after his oil & gas regulators approved 238 new offshore wells in state waters? I. Just. Don't. Get. It! #oilmoneyout #unfrackcal
298 2018-04-03 23:17:07 Supply side environmentalism Mr. Wall.
SK proposal asks little to nothing of polluters outside large oil/gas and energy providers.Does nothing to address the demand side of Pollution within the province.+your government has/had poor record on implementing its own enviro policy.

303 2018-04-03 23:15:43 What do you think the roots of this are?  People like pjw and the infowars crows willing to take absolutely anything out of context and shill snake oil?
304 2018-04-03 23:15:36 As I recall, Harper accepted the G7 goal of zero emissions by 2100, but there was no real plan. The current government has a plan: use a national carbon price floor to do our part (along the lines of the IEA price path), while continuing to ship AB oil (hence its support for KM).

317 2018-04-03 23:14:01 I can schedule the oil change  but you're on your own with cleaning 
318 2018-04-03 23:13:57 Trump could literally nuke Russia and the left would still say he's too soft on them.

Meanwhile we're putting the pressure on them by reinforcing the Baltic States and competing with Russia for the first time in 40 years by exporting natural gas and oil.

320 2018-04-03 23:13:51 Ppl, #Pruitt has dismantled EPA & is making deals w/oil & gas to line his pockets. (started dealing w/them as OK AG) Follow the. He has to hide from all who love our planet (or fly commercial).

327 2018-04-03 23:12:38 You better tell California authorities, they need to start burning that midnight oil.  As I've been told by energy, this is just the beginning to many disastrous type situations for Cali that are in the field of energy. FYI

332 2018-04-03 23:12:19 Price changes for Thursday: Not much really! Heating and stove oil to increase by 5/10ths of a cent a litre. Diesel shows an added 3/10ths of a cent a litre, and Gasoline shows a drop of just 1/10th of  a cent a litre. Fingers crossed for next week as there's a downside trend!
333 2018-04-03 23:12:18 I oil up for you
334 2018-04-03 23:12:09 @DShepYEG @calgaryherald 
And there are those who want to do away with stone age oil burners and start the energy revolution.
335 2018-04-03 23:12:04 How's our Oil and gas sector doing?
336 2018-04-03 23:12:00 nachos & oil/garlic pasta the key to my heart atm.
337 2018-04-03 23:11:59 แต่ไม่อยากทำร้ายใครเพราะความเสียดายของตัวเอง
338 2018-04-03 23:11:58 Then why not drill here for more oil
339 2018-04-03 23:11:41 sometimes our skin produces too much oil cause its trying to make up for dry skin(if that makes sense) like if youre not moisturizing that could be making your skin to be oily(er).
340 2018-04-03 23:11:33 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
341 2018-04-03 23:11:29 คนเทเองก็รู้สึกแย่เว้ย
342 2018-04-03 23:11:23 Meanwhile in @EPAScottPruitt ‘s world, $50/night condo in a $150 avg neighborhood is within reason, 1st class seats on taxpayers dime are justified, and $1.5 billion in net profits for an oil refinery is considered economic hardship. @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse #bizzaroworld

344 2018-04-03 23:11:09 Yes Will he fire him This one is Putin’s Back door Oil Promoter Trump is bound by Kompromat to produce results
345 2018-04-03 23:11:05 I would also buy coconut oil to use as a carrier oil instead of putting the oil directly on your skin
346 2018-04-03 23:10:45 Oil roti aka clap clap bread always taste better than normal roti
347 2018-04-03 23:10:42 Aye,  ignore the FACT that Scotland, makes more than any part of the fUK apart from the SE of England regardless of the FACT that oil and gas corps don't pay any tax. But with the best (admittedly, a low bar) public services. Aye,  what a basket case?

349 2018-04-03 23:10:26 so it looks like UFO oil isn’t really doing anything for my skin anymore. i may not buy another bottle when this runs out... thought it was my holy grail but for $80 my skin is a MESS sis
350 2018-04-03 23:10:20 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
351 2018-04-03 23:10:17 Why does the EPA wish to take our country backward? We see where your interest is with polluters and trying to destroy our environment for oil, gas and coal. Your name will not go down in history well. #Destroyerofourplanet
352 2018-04-03 23:10:05 Prove that motor oil is not a banned substance first.
353 2018-04-03 23:10:03 having a car is cool until u have to get an oil change.. or an inspection...or a registration sticker... or new tires... or pay for gas
354 2018-04-03 23:10:01 살려주세요..........
355 2018-04-03 23:10:01 Also, oil is a non-differentiated good. No one in San Francisco is saying "we better not maximize our revenues or we might get into a competition for talent with Gilroy." If Gilroy decided to build more housing no one would care.
356 2018-04-03 23:09:58 That was before we had North sea oil revenues. We could have managed on our own. We were lied to in 1970,we were told we were joining a trading block. Not an EU empire. you have just confirmed that's what it is. We don't want it.
357 2018-04-03 23:09:33 Put too much argan oil on my hair and now it’s like a chip pan 
358 2018-04-03 23:09:27 Jeez ok  I was like why you rubbing that pure coconut oil  thanks
359 2018-04-03 23:09:17 めこめーさんが夏に「RE-TRIAL」、秋に「雪纏ノ乙女」を出した年だったかなw
360 2018-04-03 23:08:56 Lol Use coconut oil bruh  !
361 2018-04-03 23:08:41 Redundant. 
I recommend a hot oil or deep conditioning for about 30mins before a shampooing.
362 2018-04-03 23:08:25 Today in Windsor this girl told me that she loved me hair, i showered and sprayed some coconut oil spray in it and that’s all. It’s the little things!!!
363 2018-04-03 23:08:12 Pruitt is #MAGA
364 2018-04-03 23:08:10 Also coconut oil is not going to be helpful for your pores!
365 2018-04-03 23:08:10 Tbh I still prefer Marchosias. Oil lion daddy is eh for me. Too much fanart and love for him kinda turned me off...
366 2018-04-03 23:08:04 Anyone looking for a REALLY good make up remover???? 
Doesn’t sting, cheap and all natural!

Coconut oil - who’d have thought?! 
367 2018-04-03 23:08:00 Pruitt out Friday at 5pm EST replaced by coal miner company owner or big oil CEO.
368 2018-04-03 23:07:59 @isabella_bee I’m with you when it comes to Oklahoma teachers and the corruption and big oil and gas lobby in this state. I’ll be so glad when Fallin is gone and some of the corrupt legislators are voted out.
369 2018-04-03 23:07:44 Making food when drunk is never a good idea...grace just asked the oil why it wasn't standing up
370 2018-04-03 23:07:27 If oil is based on plantlife and marine organisms; surprised that the Arctic has such deposits. I know not barren, but would think other latitudes would have more.
371 2018-04-03 23:07:17 $67 for an oil change 

But at least they wash the car inside and out 
372 2018-04-03 23:07:16 So my dad died when I was home from med school for the weekend, and he had planned to change my oil (I never asked him to, but he always did) and had the oil and filter sitting out and no fewer than three male relatives offered to do it.
373 2018-04-03 23:07:12 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
374 2018-04-03 23:07:07 I've not. I use oil paints so that's a different set of mediums.
I remember once trying acrylics and thinking 'Holy Fuck these paints dry quick!!' Was quite a shock to my ponderous nature.
375 2018-04-03 23:07:05 I struggle with this. Pipelines aren't perfect, but neither is any other mode of transportation. So what is the solution? Just shut down oil activity completely? That isn't feasible either.
376 2018-04-03 23:07:04 He NEEDS to be replaced.
Caveat - repaced with someone who has an actual understanding of climate, environmental science, justice, and isn't the pocket of lobbyists and oil/coal companies.
377 2018-04-03 23:07:03 pretty sad that these rulers are holding on to deadly oil and their greed is dangerous to the #World #OhCanada #OilOFF #NoKM #StopSiteC #Alberta #America abolish money and this insanity will wash off #WorldNews
378 2018-04-03 23:06:58 Oil shorts maybe :-) commodities never fare well in these scenarios
379 2018-04-03 23:06:52 I hear that with a touch of oil it makes a great Marianasade for meat.

381 2018-04-03 23:06:49 Used cooking oil etc taken home? Often seen it dumped down public drains. Lots issues for residents & existing traders:why no consult? RR Events don't live here; Council not Mkt traders either. Ask @InsideCroydon what happened to Surrey St Mkt with similar Council gentrification.
382 2018-04-03 23:06:42 Been going on for many years, its really sad but the world doesn’t care
If oil was found in abundance there the USA & all the stooges us included would be over there ridding the country of dictatorship & creating a quagmire of more terrorism. It really sucks
383 2018-04-03 23:06:39 Wanna shi ake ce wa jagora…!
384 2018-04-03 23:06:26 I was getting an oil change and was with my my lil cousins  I swear I thought if you but I was rushing 
385 2018-04-03 23:06:21 @pepboysauto "offers" express services for oil changes....in what world is 3 hours fast? They just pulled my vehicle in at the 3hr mark to start.... Never coming here again
386 2018-04-03 23:06:13 Ice is not good. Use Aloevera and Lavender oil and it'll be gone
387 2018-04-03 23:06:11 That feeling when you need to facepalm so badly that you forget your hand is covered in motor oil and grease... You absolute lunatics.

@PsykerTag, focus on getting back to scout base, I'll go and grab us the regular order XD
388 2018-04-03 23:05:58 Key words there “industry” compared to an association that was founded to protect gun rights. The oil and tobacco industries weren’t founded to protect anything but themselves.
389 2018-04-03 23:05:48 Who owns most of the gold, who owns most of the oil, did they ever flood the market on purpose just to get rich for a brief moment while killing an economy? what if everyone withdraws all their savings at their banks - a scare tactic, but what does it say?
390 2018-04-03 23:05:45 Very Sad News, he was a friend of my late Grandfather. My condolences to his family.
“Tom Barger, left a mining engineering professorship at the University of North Dakota, to search for oil in the vast & harsh Empty Quarter of Arabia ... , later becoming CEO of Aramco”
391 2018-04-03 23:05:38 He's only sour because the USA got no oil out of the blood for oil deal. Turned out it was a botched job by Bush/Obama he implied.
392 2018-04-03 23:05:04 Oil companies.
393 2018-04-03 23:04:56 Cheapest oil change ever! Thank you lord lol
394 2018-04-03 23:04:44 @wmnf does blaming the NRA for something they had nothing to do with count as hate? Hypocrite.

398 2018-04-03 23:04:08 Your country has killed, murdered so many in this beautiful world. For oil, control and arms. Why dont you just make Peace?? Easy ain't it, to stop now. The world is on a 6th max extinction, and your pushing it more. Think, damn u think.
399 2018-04-03 23:04:06 Its diff High if your getting oil concentrate
400 2018-04-03 23:04:03 Damn all I needed was an oil change 
401 2018-04-03 23:04:02 Yes, like it would be nonsensical for oil producing nations to agree to limit their output.
402 2018-04-03 23:03:59 Got peppermint oil in my eye like a right twat and now I can't see out of it. If I wake up blind imma be fumin

406 2018-04-03 23:03:27 you're the second person to recommend coconut oil so i'm gonna give that a shot! :)
407 2018-04-03 23:03:23 He said in an interview he had a firend who made his own olive oil. The chef of the restaurant does that. He also opened a restaurant in the Gucci Museum. hmmm 
408 2018-04-03 23:03:19 I enjoy rubbing coconut oil on my skin it is truly therapeutic
409 2018-04-03 23:03:04 I’m not going to comment until I’ve heard from David Hogg.
410 2018-04-03 23:02:59 This is how Putin took over oil & gas companies in Russia...The Autocratic Apprentice is making his mentors proud? He’s attacking one of the largest employers in the country if not the largest...who does that hurt most? Employees & 401ks.  Thats us people!
411 2018-04-03 23:02:56 Remember the oil shortage?

"Indonesia has declared a state of emergency after a large oil spill ignited and killed at least four people in the port city of Balikpapan off the island of Borneo over the weekend.

The blaze is now under control but the oil continues to spread."

425 2018-04-03 23:01:26 Simple, my guess is big oil is donating loads of money to his campaign.. Don’t bite the hand...
426 2018-04-03 23:01:22 We spent $7 Trillion in Syria (last 17 yrs) - we got zero. We didn't "keep the oil" - so ISIS got it and funded their troops.

429 2018-04-03 23:00:41 this one time, was staying at mark’s parents’ and forgot makeup remover

thought to myself, “no worries, will just find some olive oil, won’t be a problem”

halfway through using it, realize that it’s infused with garlic

subsequently smelled like italian dinner for two days :-(
430 2018-04-03 23:00:35 Read it a year or so ago. Yes, it is an intriguing book. I just returned from a trip which included Osage Co. Oklahoma. Thought about the book, as I traveled seeing oil wells, casinos, etc.

432 2018-04-03 23:00:28 I seem to remember reading in history books, stories about a whole lot of liberty ships and oil tankers leaving the US packed with food, munitions, raw materials, oil, gasoline and everything else good ole England needed to survive. You are welcome
433 2018-04-03 23:00:24 You've got the wrong assets', 9x6, oil on board.
434 2018-04-03 23:00:20 Of course Pumpkin head WOULD be more responsive to needs of Texans after Harvey than Puerto Ricans after María. Texans vote and are mostly White. Texas is a State and has oil. His buddy, Rick Perry, oil soaked Science denier, was governor of Texas. Puerto Ricans speak Spanish.
435 2018-04-03 23:00:16 Chop vegetables, toss with oil and spices, roast, eat. Super simple, super delicious.
436 2018-04-03 23:00:05 I got them on my hips & boobs but that was it. I used bio oil on my belly but not everyday. I didn’t get a single one on my belly. I don’t think there really is a way to prevent them. You either get them or you don’t. It’s weird.
437 2018-04-03 22:59:55 After analysing my diet I seem to eat pretty healthy.

The worst thing I do is fry quarn in stuff like red palm oil.

Everything else is either boiled noodles or steamed veggies.
438 2018-04-03 22:59:50 Saddam apparently had designs on charging Euros for Iraq's oil and in so doing signed his own death warrant. America pledged itself to protect all oil producing Arab nations as long as they charged for oil in dollars,dollars keep the U.S military viable.
439 2018-04-03 22:59:47 Queen Mary where you gon' go' burn? Don't ask me nothing t'all. Just gimme me match and oil. Bassin Jailhouse tis' where gon' go burn.
440 2018-04-03 22:59:40 Does my sassiness upset u?
Why are u beset with gloom?
Coz I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living?

Did u want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries? 

Dear Maya  u wld have been90 today!

442 2018-04-03 22:59:30 Oh you mean to grow hair? I heard castor oil was the big ingredient in a lot of eyelash growing products. Like GrandeLash...
443 2018-04-03 22:59:22 Alhamdulillah
444 2018-04-03 22:59:21 おはような朝
445 2018-04-03 22:59:21 The soviet union was supplying the nazis with resources while we were at war with them, including the oil that ran the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain.
446 2018-04-03 22:59:18 Oil change, tire rotation, and car wash. Who tryna get these hands
447 2018-04-03 22:59:08 ぷりすけさんがいいこといってる
448 2018-04-03 22:59:08 yeah I pop my shit at home with sea salt and an olive oil/butter reduction and tbh nothing is quite as good except for maybe the horribly bad for you movie popcorn lol
449 2018-04-03 22:58:47 I deleted the castor oil tweet because we can’t give it all away  but thanks those of you who responded [flourishing brow emoji]
450 2018-04-03 22:58:34 Get ready, girls...female toxicity is next.
451 2018-04-03 22:58:34 Yes both side do it and it’s wrong, but this point it’s not about how mean it sounds, it’s about NRA trying to sell more guns and people buying the idea it’s a patriotic thing to do, just like the oil industry argues there’s no climate change, or the tobacco industry before them
452 2018-04-03 22:58:33 In an effort to make food interesting keep it simple. Leeks, celery tops, broccoli stems, mushrooms sautéed with olive oil add a dash of s&p and a splash of red vinegar over bed polenta. #vegetarian
453 2018-04-03 22:58:32 Teens these days are snorting condoms and drinking whole bottles of olive oil. WHAT ALES YOU????
454 2018-04-03 22:58:17 Actually the game-changer was the Soviet Union. Monty's Eighth Army and the Russians would have pincered off the German's oil supply from Romania - that was the plan anyway. My Great-uncle was on Monty's staff...
455 2018-04-03 22:57:26 Here is this thing with this China/US "trade war" 
1. Trump places tariffs on steel that the US oil industry needs
2. China retaliates with duties placed on exports from Trumps voter states

456 2018-04-03 22:57:22 Just seen an advert on TV for arthritis,and what medicine you can take for ittwo drops of CBD oil every day.job done .na but big pharma cannae make money ooti that,so lots of different drugs and side affects,and you still fucked up.but hey , your doctor says take this ,so..
457 2018-04-03 22:57:11 No but I had this phase where I “washed” my face with olive, almond & jojoba oil and 3 drops of castor & streamed. Worked great but I broke out the 3rd wk—This is 0 your question, right? Never castor oil but a bit of Vaseline bc a girl in a book I read in the 5th grade did it.
458 2018-04-03 22:57:07 Oil demand is coming to an end. You should be diversifying Alberta’s industry
459 2018-04-03 22:57:00 I’ve been doing automation for oil/gas for about 2 years now
460 2018-04-03 22:56:49 Literally everything, I have a Kenra deep condition, shea moisture, deva curl, freaking oil it is so dry and frizzy I’m doomed
461 2018-04-03 22:56:45 I heard you were “partying” with Josh Fields nine months ago. Sell this snake oil elsewhere, bub. I’m on to you!
462 2018-04-03 22:56:42 car wash, oil change, and gym I feel so productive lol
463 2018-04-03 22:56:33 I'd like to try the sunflower sweets serum after seeing the results but every time I use something oil based on my face (except for one product I was able to add to the moisturizer I was using) I break out
464 2018-04-03 22:56:22 Does Argan oil help style curly hair?
465 2018-04-03 22:56:20 The guys at Express Oil in Homewood are angels. They must have seen I was having a bad day. They were so nice and replaced my broken blinker free of charge.
466 2018-04-03 22:56:19 @StandardOilCo thanks for being my favorite multi-billion dollar #oil conglomerate  slide into my DMs let’s talk lube 
467 2018-04-03 22:56:19 NO OIL DRILLING!! 
And I agree kick @FLGovScott A$S!
468 2018-04-03 22:56:15 I know its a little late for a trick but I was soaking them in penetrating oil for a day and then I ran the truck for a goos 10 min at about 1700 rpm and they all came out good for me.
469 2018-04-03 22:56:05 Extra virgin olive oil has a smoke point of only 320 degrees Fahrenheit, making it unsuitable for deep frying. Light olive oil, with a smoke point of 460 degrees Fahrenheit, can be used to deep fry
470 2018-04-03 22:56:04 plz deliver a pizza/cocktail/massage to my home

(writing this tweet made me wonder what a "pizza cocktail massage" would entail; probably being hand-fed a Margherita slice and a Negroni by a hot person while another hot person rubbed you with orange-scented oil)

472 2018-04-03 22:55:48 @ATT I can't believe you would oil your advertising from Fox News during Laura Ingrahm show,do when I shop for a new phone it won't be with you, Big Idiots!!!!!!!
473 2018-04-03 22:55:46 I would say the corporation #s and oil companies do for sure.
474 2018-04-03 22:55:43 Good luck! I’d add some cbd oil in that diet if you haven’t already tried that
475 2018-04-03 22:55:28 oil  has been located 
476 2018-04-03 22:55:27 Now to dry slightly crush and put in oil see if it works fingers crossed thats how they said do it so we will see joann if it works and u would like i can send u some of the oil ill let u kno wif it does u can give me ur mailing address if u want
477 2018-04-03 22:55:15 Yes, the famous Bakken oil boom.
478 2018-04-03 22:54:59 You have a huge tax base.  Your economy is in surplus.  We tied ourselves solely to oil.  That’s why there wasn’t a raise. There wasn’t any funds. And we will soon be bankrupt.
479 2018-04-03 22:54:50 // Boiled until they float, then pan-fry in butter (my fav) or olive oil to taste. I like a little outer brown & crisp.
480 2018-04-03 22:54:49 That's literally like asking why Exxon would want to drill oil in Russia. Because they can pipe it to Europe where they have high oil prices. Uranium is a market, like anything else. The US uses more than all of North America can produce. It's lucrative to mine it here.
481 2018-04-03 22:54:43 Check out cbd oil for those aches and pains
482 2018-04-03 22:54:38 "Dios creó a México no sólo para los mexicanos, sino también para los petroleros estadounidenses e ingleses." Standard Oil. Junio 26 de 1915.

484 2018-04-03 22:54:02 I’m going to share this everytime I see it. Especially since black people love putting coconut oil on their face which does nothing for you , but refuse to use sunscreen because “we don’t need it” 
485 2018-04-03 22:53:40 Hol up.... has #hydraleader #eltrumpito placed a tariff on gas/oil??? These prices goin up like its one
486 2018-04-03 22:53:39 
487 2018-04-03 22:53:37 @Cristiano  has no idea what naija boys call him here...  

Ororo..... "Hot oil"
488 2018-04-03 22:53:22 I said in some offshoot of this thread that it tastes fine.

I'd personally just go for oil + table salt
489 2018-04-03 22:53:15 we too are sure it has a beach attached! Let's keep it clean; oil and plastic free.

491 2018-04-03 22:53:12 @SpecialReport Ladys and gents Teddy Roosevelt went after Standard Oil so what @POTUS is doing with Amazon is not unprecedented.
492 2018-04-03 22:52:54 You can fry food in olive oil
493 2018-04-03 22:52:43 Do you have an oil exploration crew coming to help locate it?
494 2018-04-03 22:52:39 雑飯なら任せろー！！バリバリ
495 2018-04-03 22:52:32 Try doing a 50-50 of the thc/CBD dry herb or oil. They work well with each other for lain management.
496 2018-04-03 22:52:15 Its 6 yrs im here,studied here& worked in biggest oil&gas projects in Alberta as Eng & paying the same tax as a citizen but because my PR is delayed I cant benefit from it,
I wasnt disappointed till I heard about other Iranians !! There is a trend Sir! #DelayedIranianApplications
497 2018-04-03 22:52:07 Because the US keeps finding out countries have oil thats only reason they get involved
498 2018-04-03 22:52:06 When I was a kid, I used to wish that bad guys (dopey stoners) would come and take over the neighborhood, and me and my friends would take them down with Pepto Bismol and engine oil, and the adults would love it. 

As an adult, I wonder if my electronic lock is secure enough.
499 2018-04-03 22:51:51 Can inspect lot for condition of the lot and do oil tank inspections, but issue citation. Supervisor Kara Shuler finds lease language that says he does have right to do repairs and bill tenant. He says it refers to water, sewer electric.
500 2018-04-03 22:51:46 E no too dey effective... I want to have maximum efficiency
501 2018-04-03 22:51:41 I blame Big Oil.
502 2018-04-03 22:51:41 Teachers make more money mowing lawns than teaching. Prisons are overcrowded. Infrastructure is failing. And oil and gas? They get the money. #RedForEd has a simple solution- the Democratic agenda
503 2018-04-03 22:51:24 -Slice and dry well, then season with dry seasonings of choice (chili powder, 5 spice, bbq rub, whatever).
- Roughly crumble into a sieve and coat well with cornstarch, then shake off excess.
-Cook on medium-high in an iron skillet with a decent amount of oil.
504 2018-04-03 22:51:22  also should pair it with cbd oil and feel those tremendous results

506 2018-04-03 22:51:14 Gotta get those oil guys their money, they don’t have enough quite yet
507 2018-04-03 22:50:52 Example:
Q1) Guess how many people ONE 2bill $$ Nat Gas or oil sands project employs ?
Q2) How much Economic benefit?
Q3) How much tax revenue ?

Answer: MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE
508 2018-04-03 22:50:45 Lemon Pepper oil...bruhhhh sooo many choices
509 2018-04-03 22:50:28 Interesting data.  When you dig into it, it’s noticeable that oil sands production is a fraction of natural gas emissions.  And ‘oil and gas’ isn’t really a fair lumping of the data.  Curious where home heating falls into this?
510 2018-04-03 22:50:28 "It's just one woman rubbing the back of another back with oil! What's homo-erotic about that?!"
511 2018-04-03 22:50:22 Anyone have any go-to tips for dry skin? I have dealt with it and eczema all my life and yet have not found a steady solution. Going to try coconut oil though? Also looking at some of the The Ordinary products on Sephora?
512 2018-04-03 22:50:21 Huge thank you to the AWESOME Flight Attendant on @AlaskaAir flight #2184 Seattle-Pullman yesterday (4/2) who comforted my sick daughter, brought her ginger ale & peppermint essential oil, above & beyond customer service & much appreciated by this mom! #iflyalaska
513 2018-04-03 22:50:21 I just made an italianish matzoh brei riffing off a @meatmatzahballs recipe and I may eat matzoh all year round now (I added olive oil and fake sausage to it)
514 2018-04-03 22:50:05 Castor oil never worked for me but Latisse - the eyelash stuff - is a miracle for skimpy eyebrows (you can get it online).
515 2018-04-03 22:50:00 then you make a good garlic oil or butter sauce! or make a good pesto
516 2018-04-03 22:49:59 Heel and Bayley are two things that don't go together. That's like oil and water.
517 2018-04-03 22:49:58 #FoxNew - President Trump going after Amazon is not new - look what happen to Standard Oil
518 2018-04-03 22:49:42 Have you guys forgotten Teddy Roosevelt going after Standard Oil? @BretBaier
519 2018-04-03 22:49:26 Did you change the oil in your diffusion pump? lol
520 2018-04-03 22:49:22 Yes! And a clean mascara brush dipped in said oil for lashes just before bed

525 2018-04-03 22:48:57 Al have a look at that I use kiehls ultra facial oil free gel cos I’m sometimes oily but had a chemical peel last night so my face is dry as shit and it ain’t helping  Xx
526 2018-04-03 22:48:44 Tarlov is the fair & balanced ingredient for Fox's claim to being just that. She's the castor oil we take for hearing opposing views that make us stronger. Cathy Areu, however, has the brain processing power of a peanut. Her logic is bewildering. But yet we know her name.
527 2018-04-03 22:48:40 "Sometimes it’s time to come back home".. who invited us to go there in the first place? Not the UN nor the Syrian government nor Congress. We are there illegally just to kill people and steal the oil. Time to stop that madness.
528 2018-04-03 22:48:31 60 minutes later: oh... you set up all the shelters again. That was... quick.

532 2018-04-03 22:48:17 His Dad at least tried to benefit Canadians when he artificially capped oil prices under the NEP, but Justin is content to give the discount directly to the US, presumably to help support his seat at the UN or another NGO where his esoteric Pollyanna drivel is appreciated.
533 2018-04-03 22:48:00 The so-called "hard cap" allows emissions to be greater than ever before. This also allows Notley, Justin etc. to claim there is a "hard cap" No wonder Oil+Gas signed on. More BS.

537 2018-04-03 22:47:32 Except Oklahoma teachers are barely making half of that after taxes and yet Oklahoma “doesn’t have the tax revenue to fund education” meanwhile we have one of the lowest tax rates on oil companies of any state by far, despite our incredible narrow tax base focused around oil

553 2018-04-03 22:44:57 Truth, but to the Rothschilds, World Bank, Big Oil, military industrial complex etc, they’ve obtained much, which is why these wars will never stop

580 2018-04-03 22:41:11 Saudi is unnecessarily shipping oil from the eastern province to the west around the peninsula when they can lay extra pipelines. They're also re-opening an old port this year in the west: Al-Muajjiz, which used to be the Red Sea export terminal for Iraqi oil.

583 2018-04-03 22:40:58 Yeah, I'm sure the people of Syria, who overwhelmingly live in government-held areas and support the govt, are simply *terrified* about the US occupation forces returning the Syrian oil fields east of Deir-ez-Zour to their rightful owners...

584 2018-04-03 22:40:50 Why not try a topical this Tuesday? Treat yourself to a cannabis-infused body lotion, face mask, bath bomb, massage oil, balm stick or patch
585 2018-04-03 22:40:38 And proof that coal, oil, and gas are not causing it
586 2018-04-03 22:40:37 That would be too much for the US to bear. They've locked themselves into a group-political death spiral based on perpetual war to feed their military, oil and the petro-dollar, all fundamental components of their economic 'well-being'
587 2018-04-03 22:40:35 Depends on the pairing. Sometimes if we're having them with steak I'll just oil/salt/pepper and then toss them in the steak pan with all the leftover crust bits etc to finish

594 2018-04-03 22:40:06 “Not coming back” is not the situation. You are likely referring to power. Ages ago that occurred to house heating; at first we heated with coal (1930’s) hand shoveled. “stoker” came in the ‘40’s. ‘50’s=Gas (no ashes, we skipped oil). ‘70’s=electric coal fired=long like the king!

596 2018-04-03 22:39:42 The oil extracted from Chia seeds has wonderful effects on the hair and the skin. It is clinically proven to reduce the water loss by protecting the skins moisture barrier and increasing the collagen levels, making it look plump and radiant.
597 2018-04-03 22:39:38 The only lesson they learnt is keep supporting DAESH, keep killing civilians and finally Keep all the resources particularly Oil&Gas fields under control.
Kindly enlighten us if u did achieve anything except that.

603 2018-04-03 22:39:08 But you are okay giving the middle class a big FUCK YOU with the GOP Tax Scam that really only benefits the top 1% and rolling back environmental regulations meant to protect public health all to appease the oil and gas industry.
604 2018-04-03 22:39:04 Ethanol is a joke. It does more harm to the environment than oil.
605 2018-04-03 22:38:55 I been using coconut oil
606 2018-04-03 22:38:53 Was someone deep frying something and spilled some oil on the box? Wtf
607 2018-04-03 22:38:51 Advisors warn of hard work ahead? We have no authority to be there in the first place. But US is guarding the oil fields from Syria, Russia and Iran so they don't wanna leave. #WarProfiteers

619 2018-04-03 22:37:04 We agree on the part that everyone should just leave the ME alone but not now, because it’ll be a disaster and probably a major war will start that’ll affect the whole world (oil supplies, chaos for terrorists to flourish in).
620 2018-04-03 22:36:41 so deep that you can find oil..
621 2018-04-03 22:36:17 Don't use any petroleum products in your life. Lobby for keeping oil in the ground because you don't use it!! That makes sense!   Hypocrisy reigns!!!
622 2018-04-03 22:36:04 I used to use castor oil on my beard but it used to itch like mad so can't do that. I'll try black seed oil though. And what do you mean gone more black? From what?

• Scallions
• Honey
• Dehydrated chopped onions
•Red pepper flakes
630 2018-04-03 22:35:03 UGH it looked like an oil painting!!
631 2018-04-03 22:34:56 Sadly Socialism always fails.  The few w/ absolute power steal from the citizens and bankrupt the people. Ex. Venezuela, still no regular supply of food, small compared to US yet had the richest oil supply.

633 2018-04-03 22:34:38 Whoa. Is the difference with NL so big because of the tax structure placed on oil?
634 2018-04-03 22:34:27 Clearasil, noxzema , clean & clear. wash face in the morning,middle of the day, before bed. Face masks (Indian clay is good) . Use witch hazel. & to get rid of acne scars use ambi fade cream & vitamins(fish oil) & water

641 2018-04-03 22:33:01 @realDonaldTrump you can put tariffs to to oil products from countries other than USA (with some exceptions countries considers its allies)
642 2018-04-03 22:32:58 When snake oil becomes the opiate of the masses.
643 2018-04-03 22:32:45 I know we can't always control the laws government passes. We can control our own actions by recycling. When I walk along the beach and see cigarette buts in the sand. The ocean is not an ashtray or garbage dump. THe government should also know better no oil rigs in the oceans.
644 2018-04-03 22:32:37 You plan on running this like Kiel Bros Oil? Didn’t you run your family business into the ground? Why would we want you to represent us?
645 2018-04-03 22:32:34 I also (mis)read 
"8. It's possible that there is an additive that is a marker"
as meaning an _intentional_ marker, as is added to some explosives (or home heating oil), not congener=unintentional byproduct of a specific process.
646 2018-04-03 22:32:22 An idiot left a tray of mother oil out and my cat jumped in it so I have to shave him

657 2018-04-03 22:31:09 Tonight, I had a deep fried mac n cheese burger. That, my friends, is macaroni cheese slapped into a sloppy patty shape and dropped in hot oil until crispy, then cuddled in a bun  #prayformojo

688 2018-04-03 22:25:02 Saudi controls the price of oil, when it manages to get agreement on controlling supply with the rest of OPEC. It has by far the lowest cost of production. As demand drops faster than oil reserves run out, the price will drop whatever Saudi does.
689 2018-04-03 22:25:01 It's not always about the glitz and the glam--a good, hearty sandwich is its own thrill.

I usually use American mixed with whatever I have on hand, and maybe sauteed onions. For soup I'll make tomato, with sauteed scallions & garlic (in olive oil) with a dash of salt and pepper.

699 2018-04-03 22:23:50 You know I hear that they're actually sitting on top of one of the world's largest oil locations and yet have done absolutely nothing to utilize it. Do you have any idea how rich they would be? They'd probably be like Dubai if they actually started drilling & selling.
700 2018-04-03 22:23:46 People need more 
a. common sense
b. empathy
c. caring & supportive environment

these will result in:

fewer shootings

But nobody cares, because money, career, guns, carriers, tanks, status, oil, power first!

706 2018-04-03 22:22:53 Congratulations to Mike Flynn for getting the hell out of there, rather than witnessing the planet killing destruction of the @EPA by greedy, dishonest, unethical, science-denying, big oil/gas/coal/chem purchased, VILLAIN @EPAScottPruitt
707 2018-04-03 22:22:52 Unfortunately, climate change deniers are a dime a dozen, and oil companies can (and probably will) pay a lot of money to get another denier on top looking out solely for their interests
708 2018-04-03 22:22:33 Instead of carbon tax, why not promote our oil and LNG to China and India to help reduce their dependence on oil thereby reducing their emissions? We contribute <2% of world emissions so it doesn't make sense for us to cripple our economy with a carbon tax.
709 2018-04-03 22:22:22 So the oil light on and off all day and only gained 7 pounds in 3 months.
710 2018-04-03 22:22:17 Agreed. Though I did read Churchill didn't help matters by persuading the US to help keep Anglo-Persian oil interests safe as opposed to helping Russia defeat the Germans
711 2018-04-03 22:21:33 I have waited almost two hrs for an oil change is this normal?

716 2018-04-03 22:20:56 The chairs, the barbed wire, the fire, the thumbtacks - no, the one thing that did Tommy Dreamer in was peppers in oil.
717 2018-04-03 22:20:55 When crude oil price was above $100/barrel before 2014, the BJP was protesting against high Petrol/Diesel prices. Since 2014, crude prices have fallen: now the price is $68/barrel. Yet why do Petrol/Diesel prices in India keep rising
Does PM care for the middle classes &amp; poor
718 2018-04-03 22:20:49 Also hast Du keine Ahnung, wovon ich rede. Sonst hättest DU IBM, General Motors, Standard Oil of New Jersey, und Ford aufzählen können.
719 2018-04-03 22:20:48 @JennaJulien You two should tell funny stories about the dogs and Ad, stories from your childhood, and more Snake Oil. Your podcasts help me through a lot of stuff, thank you two 
720 2018-04-03 22:20:36 Do baked fried chicken. You still have some of the breading, but dont have the "cooking in oil" aspect
721 2018-04-03 22:20:29 Actually no. Don’t like pot. Never did. Not my thing. I’ve tried pure CBD oil for body pain.  But didn’t work for me.
722 2018-04-03 22:20:28 @realDonaldTrump the tactic is that, for example, the smaller oil companies that are not from the United States will disappear and leave their market to companies in the United States
723 2018-04-03 22:20:17 She knew mudddaafcknnnn welllll I wouldn’t got this car if I knew abt the 400$ oil changes
724 2018-04-03 22:20:16 What was the relevance of the virginity of the women in the story of the 10 virgins? 

The morale of the story was stay ready so you don't gotta get ready. Abi?

So why was their hymen status important, in the narrative of how they stored or did not store oil?
725 2018-04-03 22:20:14 Just take black seed oil. It's been proven to be effective against these so called super bugs. Stop tryna scare everyone.

734 2018-04-03 22:19:02 Oooh, I've never put balsamic on them. We like them plain. Just fried in olive oil, or with a little bacon fat. They look like tiny fries. In fact, when eldest was about 4, she saw a McD's truck and said "parsnips!". lol.

“take computers out of classrooms and don’t release names of the shooters!”

...pretty sure it’s a bit more complicated but thanks for ur input
751 2018-04-03 22:17:09 Quick question for our president.  You said we were stupid and should have taken the oil, but instead ISIS got the oil. Now you say we have defeated ISIS. I assume we now have the oil?
752 2018-04-03 22:17:09 EU need gas and oil. Question is not appeasing dictators

Offered to you from my spirit,

Which you accepted with the utmost respect.

762 2018-04-03 22:15:55 Let's analyze that, who controls the price of oil? Then ask yourself who controls them?..
763 2018-04-03 22:15:53 Mixed with beets and potatoes, (white & sweet), tossed with olive oil, salt, garlic, and balsamic, then baked.
764 2018-04-03 22:15:50 And Trump goes on about "keeping the oil" against international law.  How embarrassing.
765 2018-04-03 22:15:47 Your message should go to  irresponsible government we install. I feel the pains of oil rich states . He  promised to build functional refinery within six months in office and carry out a turn around maintenance of the existing ones.What do we have ? Think.
766 2018-04-03 22:15:39 No one should be surprised by Trump’s statement. This correlates with his repeated “...should have taken the oil.” mantra (in an attempt to highlight Iraq occupation failures by U.S. leadership.)  He repeated this latter statement at recently as today.
767 2018-04-03 22:15:30 I'm an official oil field man 
768 2018-04-03 22:15:25 i wish facemasks removed the ugly, not just the dirt & oil
769 2018-04-03 22:15:22 Have you evee tried oil pastel? Still has the possibilities, but it seems a little easier to blend in my opinion.
770 2018-04-03 22:15:20 How wide is the #SDF controlled strip opposite #albukmal until #ISIS controlled territory? It seems that #SAA could cross the #Euphrates there and attack ISIS thus getting at the oil fields and a presence on the east bank of the Euphrates
771 2018-04-03 22:15:19 Russia leave interest to EU gas and oil market. Since 2018 Russia reduced oil exports to European countries by 3.5%, reorienting them to the East.

773 2018-04-03 22:15:15 Coworker: “Burning the midnight oil, huh?”

774 2018-04-03 22:15:14 I consider garlic and olive oil to be the only essential food group.
775 2018-04-03 22:15:10 My client was giving me a lecture on tanning with baby oil and was like “omg sweetie didn’t your mom teach you to wear sunscreen” listen lady my mom is the tanning queen who do you think taught me to use baby oil

778 2018-04-03 22:15:03 @realDonaldTrump I also want to suggest that to win the trade war you must have powerful and voluntary allies that dominate areas of global trade such as oil exploitation and the production of hydrocarbons and their derivatives.
779 2018-04-03 22:14:55 I’ll take a FULL body massage with some warm oil and soft music 
780 2018-04-03 22:14:45 No, Venezuela has expanded its original border contention claim, to now include territories that were never disputed— solely due to the oil find. It is clear that you do not understand the issue past or present.
781 2018-04-03 22:14:45 If you put coconut oil on your face as a moisturizer just know that I’m praying for your skin.
782 2018-04-03 22:14:44 Oil Man brewed coffee from the blood of Clown Man and validated their feelings
783 2018-04-03 22:14:44 shoulda changed my oil when it was nice out 
784 2018-04-03 22:14:19 Trump says he want to have good relations with Putin..  Translates into getting a 19% interest in Roseneft Oil if he lifts sanctions so the merger with Exonmobile can take place. Trump's payment is 25 billion dollars. #ImpeachTrump @CNN

787 2018-04-03 22:14:02 Like I’ve had rough/hard/dirty jobs before, But I literally see oil/grease/coal dust rinsing off my body, I have to use special hard gritty soap to scrub my hands and I honestly love it.
788 2018-04-03 22:14:00 Topiclear Paris Serum with Argan Oil will help lighten and smooth complexion and even out your skin tone.
789 2018-04-03 22:13:46 Dinosaurs Thrived for 150million years,  in a 1600-4000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 350ppm. Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice. We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
790 2018-04-03 22:13:46 i just did a DIY mask now i have to wait an hour let’s what this extra virgin oil does for my hair :-)
791 2018-04-03 22:13:19 It's truly a shame how many people pay auto services to do something as simple as CHANGE YOUR OIL. Its literally the easiest thing and y'all throwin cash away and don't even realize
792 2018-04-03 22:13:16 Need carrot seed oil, xanthan gum or vegetable glycerin
793 2018-04-03 22:13:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective
794 2018-04-03 22:13:00 the Dutch royal fam & the Dutch East India Co & Dutch Shell Oil have centuries of despicable history enslaving indigenous ppl, stripping/stealing resources

798 2018-04-03 22:12:22 He means, “we should’ve kept the oil”. He’s said as much a number of times.
799 2018-04-03 22:12:21 But about the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness & hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy
800 2018-04-03 22:12:21 My coffee had soap in it. My lunch was ruined by a car air freshener package. A cream egg exploded in my jacket pocket. My furnace ran out of oil. #HappyTuesday
801 2018-04-03 22:12:17 It's about time we sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. I'll get a good price!

805 2018-04-03 22:11:42 Ask @MBuhari his plan on maximizing his GREATEST RESOURCES, he won't be able to say because he has none.

I can bet you that for Mr Buhari, his greatest resources are not the Nigerian people but the crude oil.

813 2018-04-03 22:10:59 pigeons are beautiful birds. their feathers are the color of stormclouds and oil slicks, and each one looks just a little different from the last. i like watching them survive.
814 2018-04-03 22:10:42 Don't count on it, to the sjw left everything is toxic masculinity.  To slate/vox/jezebel the only story will be about how he made her do it.  And they will be completely blind to how it infantilizes women.

But it will be forgotten asap by the msm, it doesn't fit the narrative
815 2018-04-03 22:10:42 Really? You think this kind of messaging is going to penetrate any further than the #fakefoxnews crowd? Why don't you spend your advertising dollars on moving toward renewable resources. Oil has a brief window in the larger context of history. Renewables are your future too.
816 2018-04-03 22:10:34 Easy pasta recipe. Slice a bunch of cherry tomatoes in half and roast them with garlic, olive oil and whatever spices you want and throw it all over some pasta (I use thin spaghetti) and shake on some Parmesan cheese. Tasty and much lighter than with sauce.

824 2018-04-03 22:09:46 I just don’t think it’s a masterpiece. It’s a great space opera that succeeded well beyond its scope because it was a timely allegory for oil and exploitation.
825 2018-04-03 22:09:42 If Donald Trump's silly tweets create opportunities for Australian wine producers (at the expense of Californian wine producers) - they will jump at it.

861 2018-04-03 22:03:27 I looked up the court case. Judge ruled against the scientist's 'smoking gun' argument that the oil companies were colluding, but did not refute (or agree with) the science itself. Score one for you.
I stand by my fetus/baby statement. A rhetorical question clarifies nothing
862 2018-04-03 22:03:24 The reason Saudi reduced the oil price was to stop investment in US shale gas, which would wholly replace oil for energy production. The effect on Russia was a side-effect, as was the impact on Venezuela. It only works as long as Saudi can keep the price low...
863 2018-04-03 22:03:06 Oh and the countries where they are made generate almost all their power with oil and coal
864 2018-04-03 22:03:02 tomorrow i have to go get my oil changed and i already want to fight any middle aged man who looks at me for more than 3 seconds in the garage
865 2018-04-03 22:03:02 That was a very lack-lustre effort by the Oil, even our local senior hockey team gives full effort when there's only pride to play for!  
866 2018-04-03 22:02:44 Not to be dramatic but I just got this Tea Tree oil toner and it is working amazingly on my skin

879 2018-04-03 22:01:21 So still not qualified to judge the validity of climate science, I see.  And you have no idea how old I am. Tell me, how did the oil industry discover mtbe was the source of pollution. Did they model it or did they use “formulae” because without formulae, it’s not science, right?
880 2018-04-03 22:01:19 also of COURSE olive oil doesnt prevent sticking while youre cooking it, its so it doesnt stick AFTER you take it out and serve it in a dish. you can still get sticking after it comes out the water

887 2018-04-03 22:00:27 Couldn't agree more. I'm stuck here. Can hardly afford to stay, certainly can't afford to move. Hating it, but have to make the best of it when there's no alternative. I live where all the ag & oil are.

897 2018-04-03 21:59:26 The guy who did my oil change today had the sexist accent. Long story short, ended up spending way more than expected 
898 2018-04-03 21:58:57 Use oil, like coconut oil, it really helps
899 2018-04-03 21:58:34 Oil pain? Did you mean anal pain?

910 2018-04-03 21:57:17 Seriously, the people of #Alberta need to get a grip. Before the oil boom, they needed the rest of the country desperately and soon, when oil crashes and it is coming sooner than most think, they will again.
911 2018-04-03 21:56:49 I’m at the dealership waiting for my oil change and one of the workers hit his wax pen LFMAOOO

916 2018-04-03 21:55:54 There you go Mr. POTUS
take the money From Honduras and Mexico if the NAFTA deal fail
We could stop taking their oil since we don't really need it
917 2018-04-03 21:55:53 Other than free ice cream? End all coal and oil burning for power. Extend nukes while building 100% RE. Gap with gas but on existing pipes. Build transmission instead of pipes. Massive investments in EE and car charging/electrification. If also have genie powers fix CCS

923 2018-04-03 21:55:16 This is the type of specious reasoning that NRA lobbyists use to conceal, confuse, and lead astray. Also, Big Oil, Big Tobacco, Big Pharma, etcetera...
924 2018-04-03 21:55:13 The liberal  'climate plan' consists of shutting down Canada's oil and gas industry and implementing an absolutely ineffective carbon tax that hurts every aspect of our economy. Shame on the minister for being so scientifically and economically ignorant.

933 2018-04-03 21:53:31 That someone would attempt to diagnose and share on a legal document someone else they’ve never even evaluated makes him/her more of a snake oil salesman. Sounds to me like they’re picking on a child

935 2018-04-03 21:53:20 The federal & provincial AGs said only 2 have a plan in place just last week. As for the oil co many have left Canada since & what they asked for was certainty not a carbon tax. They were agreeing because it helped them decide what to do regarding investments, most have left.

945 2018-04-03 21:52:17 @IndycarRoss Hi Gordon, l listened to your piece on @TrulyScottishtv regards the Oil fields being sold to the UK @ a knock down price, generous idea but they'd be demanding we pay a proportion of the UK national debt too ( how would we fund that ?) and....1/2 >

960 2018-04-03 21:50:12 Indeed. Much as you douse a fire with oil, more guns. 

CNN now saying the suspect is female and dead, so speculating it is a relationship issue or similar. Because women don’t have mental health issues or political opinions etc, so it can’t be that 
961 2018-04-03 21:50:12 S/O to my dad and cousin because the only few things I know about maintaining a car is pumping gas, getting an oil change, and keeping it clean

1003 2018-04-03 21:43:52 "Getting On With Russia is a good thing" WTF? (Wednesday, Thursday and FRIDAY) What a massive turd. He so wants that oil, as does Putin..although deal has gone awry. He just kicked Theresa May in the face. @JohnOSullivan36 @sunlitweb @1nterest1ngfact @RedloraineV
1004 2018-04-03 21:43:42 We NEED electric cars, buses and trucks! screw all the pollution with gas cars the breakdowns and NON reliable gas cars and trucks that make oil companies even richer the ones polluting our planet and water
1005 2018-04-03 21:43:39 Why do we have baby oil? Babies are already slippery.
1006 2018-04-03 21:43:35 Translation: It’s time to give Putin control of Syria’s oil and gas, which is why Putin backed Syria’s leader. ISIS was just the excuse.

1011 2018-04-03 21:43:00 I wait for almond oil to get down to $9/16oz and buy like 5 bottles.
1012 2018-04-03 21:42:57 Bummer. What would you recommend for cold liquids? Mineral oil? Thanks for replying
1013 2018-04-03 21:42:52 He wants me to be a man so bad lol. That’s why he taught me how to change my tires and oil... still not doing it myself tho lol 
1014 2018-04-03 21:42:45 @RandPaul we can increase oil production 41% with oil extracted from coal  largest coal companies are ready to invest all money for plant in Ashland Kentucky.
1015 2018-04-03 21:42:41 not really its jealousy of CPEC they know it will haunt them when their oil runs out in 20 years who will want to live in a city thats so expensive n when u have a cheaper alternative 100 clicks away.Jealous
1016 2018-04-03 21:42:32 Let’s keep it going boys! Go Oil Caps Go!!!!
1017 2018-04-03 21:42:29 I got 3 quarts of oil tho I don't die

1020 2018-04-03 21:42:06 Be sure and raise hell about this. Trump seized 85% of this beautiful land for oil drilling, coal mining, logging and more. #rapingtheland
1021 2018-04-03 21:41:46 I brought the Haitian castor oil. Thank you @Jessiewoo_
1022 2018-04-03 21:41:42 Iraq and Russia and China move in. The price of oil will double. These countries would be in control. The US is a small player at OPEC. Has no more clout.
1023 2018-04-03 21:41:37 I liked the bear one apart from when he got eaten by the bear, no one should like that bit. I haven’t seen the volcano one bit the oil fields are very beautiful. I really really want to see the siberian trappers one
1024 2018-04-03 21:41:34 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1025 2018-04-03 21:41:34 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1029 2018-04-03 21:41:01 also a hot oil treatment!
1030 2018-04-03 21:41:01 Try putting a couple drops of mineral oil in before a hot shower a few times a week, it really helps
1031 2018-04-03 21:40:56 Lmfao yeah go get an oil change before you mess up your car
1032 2018-04-03 21:40:51 Just remember, Norway is in the EEA and could now be pulled into the court in DenHaag and forced to give up recourses we have in a he Barents Sea. Fisheries (600 million in snow crabs only) + oil and gas reserves. Not all song and dance from the EU. Just watch out.
1033 2018-04-03 21:40:43 Why I think gas engines were picked to be the mainstay transportation? 1- Big oil profits 2- Profits from all the maintenance and breakdown of mechanical parts 3- Parts store profits 4- Repair shop profits 5- Oil changes and filters 6- hundreds of parts to breakdown for profit

1039 2018-04-03 21:40:11 It's funny that all those demanding for 'immediate fiscal restructuring' aren't saying how States with this level of IGR can survive??? 

Cause if u aren't an oil producing State; its gonna be chaos ooo... No State can change its IGR fundamentals drastically in the short run!
1040 2018-04-03 21:39:53 He likes the American Oil memes
1041 2018-04-03 21:39:40 Vaping like a fiend. Almost wish the oil in my pen was something stronger.
1042 2018-04-03 21:39:27 Need to follow the money. Oil industry is clearly pulling the strings on this puppet.

1048 2018-04-03 21:38:51 RT @_MASENATE @MassGovernor @MothersOutFront @CleanAirMoms BillS.2302/S.479 allows "minimum impact" to humans .. How far from a wind turbine would one have to be to not have house on fire, hot oil splashed, air borne toxic chemicals inhaled .. how fast can MA fire dept control?
1049 2018-04-03 21:38:48 I found toothache essence in the midst of my pain, just look at God. It's a numbing oil available at alpha pharmacy in Durban (also nalapha ngase shweta)… Anyhu it numbs the pain :-)
1050 2018-04-03 21:38:31 This is absurdly dumb and wrong.

You're suggesting that Quebec actively chooses to have less money so that it can get some for free.

If we kept our oil/gas in the ground and got equalization we'd be worse off than we are now.
1051 2018-04-03 21:38:20 My nail guy John goes "I'm gonna take care of you today baby" and gave me the best nails ever and even touched up my tattoos with cuticle oil.  LOVE HIM
1052 2018-04-03 21:38:17 For soup, cook diced leek in oil, then simmer with beef, green curry paste, beef broth and black beans. Top with orzo.
1053 2018-04-03 21:38:09 Aye I got that oil change now ain’t nobody trying to race
1054 2018-04-03 21:37:48 That, and Argentina had a treaty to share in mineral rights but tore it up just prior to the oil being fully discovered.
Sucks to be Argentina.
1055 2018-04-03 21:37:45 You know your a loser when you look forward to going home to clean and oil all of your saddles 
1056 2018-04-03 21:37:32 I just can sense Anti-incumbency in this figure.... Government aim is just to collection and reduce the loan burden on oil companies which will not vote then in 2019 general election.
1057 2018-04-03 21:37:30 Why are the gas prices going up and up over the Easter weekend?
Are we now exporting oil— maybe we need to keep more oil for our use here in the USA
1058 2018-04-03 21:37:26 Front two tires bald , back two tires had nails in them, brakes and brake pads fucked up, needed an alignment and oil change. Not including the accident damage I got from yesterday
1059 2018-04-03 21:37:16 I love that several people came thinking he would talk about oil or banking. What did he talk about? Early childhood brain science.
1060 2018-04-03 21:37:16 After a great 2 hours listening to a CSI learned a lot more. Now catching up in some #Emergency5 as my stats got deleted for some reason and even my steam achievements were gone  now at the flooding mission with 28 victims to safe and some fire to put out (oil platform).
1061 2018-04-03 21:37:01 Big oil rules.  Pruitt is from failing Oklahoma and will make our country fail, too.   The rest of the world goes sun, wind, electric, while we praise coal and oil.
1062 2018-04-03 21:36:39 i'm diffusing an oil blend called "hope"

i feel like i could use it right now
1063 2018-04-03 21:36:38 Incompetence. Call their bosses' boss. The equally wheel gets the oil, especially at a car dealership
1064 2018-04-03 21:36:37 If this lady puts any more oil on my legs....... she’s been putting oil on my legs for 20 mins
1065 2018-04-03 21:36:36 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
1066 2018-04-03 21:36:36 literally me. I'm getting my "grippers" done Friday but never got an oil change 
1067 2018-04-03 21:36:34 Told that nigga don’t go to sleep I’m pourin oil all ova him .

1070 2018-04-03 21:36:01 That's hysterical.  My first car was a Pinto, aka mustang.  It caught on fire and blew up because it had so many oil leaks.
1071 2018-04-03 21:35:58 @BootsNo7 I’m using your day cream for normal/oily skin and want to let you know that I think the formula is so off the mark! It’s thicker than the night cream and makes my skin look like an oil slick. Any chance of developing a proper range for oily skin?
1072 2018-04-03 21:35:39 I wish these states could take care of their people without needing our Blue state resources. I believe that they per the Constitution are responsible for funding their student educations. No excuse for any state that pumps/fracks Oil to not be able to provide for their kids.
1073 2018-04-03 21:35:37 I live that life (I irrigate every couple of weeks as a course of maintenance and put oil in my ears and take supplements and all this shit about having garbage ears)

1076 2018-04-03 21:35:00 I did & someone deleted it. The manifesto is a lie .. a snake oil document positioned in the centre left .. but the reality it’s not worth wiping your arse with it. The hard left are in control.
1077 2018-04-03 21:34:59 If I get another call about CBD oil at work I’m gonna jump off a bridge
1078 2018-04-03 21:34:59 *dies* I’d even try snake oil at this point.
1079 2018-04-03 21:34:53 I just bought an oil diffuser cause self care.
1080 2018-04-03 21:34:49 Yesterday I twitted: "with sufficient butter, wine, garlic, and olive oil, spinach tastes awesome". I think I may have to do the same for cloud strategy.
1081 2018-04-03 21:34:45 Currently very frustrated in my oil painting class someone help 
1082 2018-04-03 21:34:33 Because we lack the ability to apply those tools in a meaningful manner in a world with diverse governmental regimes and a massive over-supply of oil....
1083 2018-04-03 21:34:33 This year alone I said I’m tired of paying a mechanic, if it’s on YouTube I can do it. I have fixed my heater, changed my oil, and fixed my window. Today I figured out why it was over heating.

1086 2018-04-03 21:34:16 I'm loving the Dennis Gross products; especially the alpha beta glow pads, also Votary facial oil is amazing, as is the cleansing oil. Just for when your shelves are empty
1087 2018-04-03 21:33:59 UK white nationalist and snake oil salesman... who? Not even moving the needle.
1088 2018-04-03 21:33:52 I shouted... Ororo...anointing oil.. Like @olamide_YBNL said
1089 2018-04-03 21:33:46 NRA is also behind Global Warming, JFK, RFK and MLK assasinations...and the sinking of the Titanic
1090 2018-04-03 21:33:36 we use coconut oil on our dogs in regards to itching and it helps immensely. We usually use coconut oil infused shampoo but rubbing some pure coconu oil into his fur is fine as well
1091 2018-04-03 21:33:34 Meschiach, the Hebrew phrase from which we get Messiah, refers primarily to the physical act of anointing someone (typically priests, prophets and kings) or something (bread) with oil.  In The Writings, it comes to be associated with figurative anointing. @WilGafney #BriteBible

1098 2018-04-03 21:32:50 You are are weasel, if you believe that this was the desired outcome how come you didn’t describe this when you attended the NFU conference, my guess is that you hadn’t the courage of your convictions, you mock & sneer, you are the epitome of a snake oil salesman

1108 2018-04-03 21:31:50 @adamclanton @JaysonBraddock Osteen is a snake oil salesman who sweet talks people into giving him money. Remember the "nobody asked us to help" during the hurricane? Some christian he is lol

1117 2018-04-03 21:30:42 Well this is what happens when voters listen to snake oil sales man.
1118 2018-04-03 21:30:41 But I pair it with Jamaican black Castor oil and sometimes the Cantu coconut curling cream.
1119 2018-04-03 21:30:24 Your cover image reminds me of RT. Good work their Comrade Stein. You sat with an oil hungry murderous dictator...took pictures and smiled. You should lose your "Green" Card...sell out. How much did they pay you? Why did you agree? Shame on you. You make me sick.

1122 2018-04-03 21:29:57 3/ By the end of the 70s, the second oil shock and stagflation put an enormous hurt on an otherwise exceedingly profitable industry.  That led to some radical style changes that most people think happened organically.  Corporate rock was put on a short leash.  Disco happened.
1123 2018-04-03 21:29:20 Yes, the must rotate as my special hair oil disappeared awhile back.
1124 2018-04-03 21:28:58 Should use old oil rigs as turbine platforms and their pipelines as cabling infrastructure.
1125 2018-04-03 21:28:54 I came back home and somebody informed me of a lawnmower that somebody was giving away. I am not confident with lawnmowers although any attention to a yard is better than none. I'll need to get some gas and oil in it. I don't drive so I'm not used to that
1126 2018-04-03 21:28:53 you guys at ggg actually think that something that looks like a dying bird near an oil spill is good artwork (at a whopping 27 usd)? but i agree, it perfectly fits the amount of fail that is the bestiary league. good job.
1127 2018-04-03 21:28:50 listen you #flaccid snake oil salesman. don't confuse faith w/ blind obedience,  don't muddle religion w/ ideology, & don't use these parables to justify your hate/fear of the tonnage your small mind can't comprehend. it isn't scripture it's #emptyrhetoric
1128 2018-04-03 21:28:43 Farmer on the radio today “the man upstairs needs to turn on the oil, fast”.
1129 2018-04-03 21:28:39 Are you accounting for the potential heavy oil crude import decreases from VZ? Thanks for your insights!
1130 2018-04-03 21:28:38 Not surprised. Fox faux news has no integrity. It justs pushes propaganda. Haven't watched them in 14 years. Went to get the oil changed in my car last week and they had Fox on. Told them unless they changed the channel I was taking my business elsewhere. They put CNN on for me.
1131 2018-04-03 21:28:38 Why tf doterra essential oil $30?!?!?
1132 2018-04-03 21:28:35 The word we use for "Messiah" in its verbal form can mean rubbing oil on a sacred person, a sacred object...or putting oil on your bread for a meal.   #britebible @WilGafney

1151 2018-04-03 21:25:25 Main reason is Saudi is using so much oil itself (30%+ of its production, poss rising to 50/60%+) it could not function as swing producer - so they are building a fleet of 30 nukes, plus solar. Similarly, 1st UAE nuke plant just went live

1162 2018-04-03 21:23:20 The OK legislature has been bought and paid for by the Oil and Natural Gas CEOs.  No one is for taxing the little guy, but rather forcing these billion dollar oil companies to pay their fair share to fund education. Please research and understand the crookedness of the OK leg.
1163 2018-04-03 21:23:19 Not so well considering you have huge oil deposits and can buy lesser than yr neighbours..
1164 2018-04-03 21:23:13 It's true though, the Twinspark may have character, but it's an engineering disaster. Poor fuel consumption,  high oil consumption & a ridiculous cambelt replacement interval are major negatives.
1165 2018-04-03 21:23:08 Ororo is actually Vegetable Oil, but it was coined from his name, ROnaldo. Ro-Ro-Ronaldo!
1166 2018-04-03 21:23:07 And the real kicker, oil/gas is up 50% per barrel and everyone's health care went up. Definitely no gain. Forget getting ahead.

1171 2018-04-03 21:22:19 We burn it because it's valuable.
The oil can be transported easily and cheaply.
It has relatively high energy density.

Much, much higher than solar or wind.
It's actually very expensive to harvest that energy.
You need rare materials, transport the equipment, maintenance, etc.
1172 2018-04-03 21:21:30 The was never a rainbow nation and the will never be one. Oil and water don't mix. Oil must go back where it came from

U.S. crude supply fell 3.28M barrels last week, API says
The American Petroleum Institute reportedly shows a draw of 3.28M barrels of crude oil for the week ending March 30, vs. a build of 5.32M last week.
1175 2018-04-03 21:21:20 Point all you want to junk bikes in China. Consumption of oil and spewing of CO2 has not changed at all globally. BEVs have a better chance
1176 2018-04-03 21:20:36 Venezuela is the global leader in crude oil reserves. But citizens are starving, their country is in shambles. What a contradiction - rich but poor. Nothing equates to bad leadership which would defy all natural advantages in its determination to ensure that citizens poor.

1181 2018-04-03 21:20:12 You can't just make anything from oil.
It consists of molecules of different lengths.
The longer the sturdier the material.
Gas has single length molecules.
Tar has the longest.
Everything else is in between.
You can't just turn oil into tar.
Although I don't know flexible it is.

1261 2018-04-03 21:09:28 I always thought the Middle East should be left alone, let them settle their own differences. We don’t need their oil, we have our own. Don’t waste US military lives over there.

1286 2018-04-03 21:06:22 Why the fuck does corn gotta be in everything nowadays? Corn syrup, corn oil, that shit be in every single food. Not only that but they gotta replace every fucking food with corn. Potato chips? Nah fam, corn chips. Regular ass flour? Nah fam, corn flour. Fuck corn.

1292 2018-04-03 21:05:54 Oiling hair/scalp with coconut or olive oil helps sometimes. Being around people can help but too much social interaction can trigger anxiety leading to more Trich relapses. Still figuring out a good balance.
1293 2018-04-03 21:05:44 He owes Oligarchs big $$$$. He won’t release his taxes because he’s broke. He made a deal w/Russia to end sanctions in exchange for forgiveness of some of his debt. He didn’t count on Congress hogtying him. He’s making deals w/gas & oil  companies to get the rest of the $.

1366 2018-04-03 20:56:44 Your lack of knowledge is what I find I appropriate. Have you noticed that emissions type pollution is down considerably across the nation! Obviously it works! Why would we want cars that get less mileage on a tank of gas? Oh that's right.....we do that we'll need more oil
1367 2018-04-03 20:56:33 i've considered taking on this topic academically but i came to the conclusion i'd get way too mad so my knowledge of them is limited other than they're evil bad oil people who gotta go

1376 2018-04-03 20:54:57 If you are so certain get a major science academy to endorse your views.  A petroleum funded one makes me quite suspicious.  I am for oil sands development, but that doesn't mean denying the science it is simply understanding fossil fuels won't disappear for many years.
1377 2018-04-03 20:54:38 The people I know on that side of the divide are calling for the apocalypse of fossil fuel industry with the CT. Its not what I believe its what they believe. I personally think the poor and middle class will suffer more than big oil.

1408 2018-04-03 20:51:04 Is there an essential oil that’ll make me cry less??
1409 2018-04-03 20:51:01 The “war crime” was invading Iraq in the first place, when it was not in ’s legitimate interest.  

That’s Trump’s point about Iraqi oil.  To conquer for resource plunder is wrong, but still more legitimate than whatever mysterious reason the US did invade.
1410 2018-04-03 20:50:54 Oh wow, you’re going to have to buy some oil then.
1411 2018-04-03 20:50:42 One thing I always forget to do is get an oil change on my car 
1412 2018-04-03 20:50:42 That other than healthcare it’s un affordable and having a federal government set out to destroy the oil industry the talk of separation again raises its ugly head..Terrible what’s happened
1413 2018-04-03 20:50:25 Short term fast cash for his oil buddies. That's 100% it, full stop.
1414 2018-04-03 20:50:07 We are used to snakes, snake oil sales men etc in Florida. Nothing to see here. Js
1415 2018-04-03 20:50:02 Ororo no be crude oil...
1416 2018-04-03 20:49:48 I'm only short oil right now from 66.10 and that could change at any time ...
1417 2018-04-03 20:49:44 i haven’t, but i get ear blocks regularly and i tried olive oil once or twice in the past but it didn’t work :(((

1419 2018-04-03 20:49:33 Maybe you should see that they learn how to clean up the oil spill on the coast and how to count dead wildlife covered in oil
1420 2018-04-03 20:49:32 they just drill in their back garden and find oil probably
1421 2018-04-03 20:49:25 But what a gift to the oil and gas industry, who happen to be major GOP donors.
1422 2018-04-03 20:49:24 Juventus is just PSG with olive oil & Balsamic vinegar
1423 2018-04-03 20:49:15 tea tree oil fixes everything omg
1424 2018-04-03 20:49:15 I suspect China wants closer ties to Saudi on a business perspective because they're looking to start trading oil in Petro Yuan. Some people believe Saudi is thinking about ditching the PetroDollar. That is hugely significant. Militarily Russia and China are close allies.

1427 2018-04-03 20:49:03 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
1428 2018-04-03 20:48:57 In a Africa home the first Aid you find is the anointing oil. True or false.
1429 2018-04-03 20:48:44 Bath, oil burner, and rub it on the bottom of your feet lol
1430 2018-04-03 20:48:43 Gloves, don’t soak the rag. Stand over wooden floor. Most butcher block oil is just mineral oil or mineral oil and other additives. When all else fails lay some newspaper, old sheet or brown paper bag down? Honestly not that messy with a glove and rag.
1431 2018-04-03 20:48:32 Most girls/women keep stuff like that in their purse.
1432 2018-04-03 20:48:29 Most AIM punters will think #IMM's mcap is too high, much rather throw their money on an oil share spike 2 years from production with no cash. Look what the mcap is in 3 weeks....

1434 2018-04-03 20:48:12 As an added bonus: The first true canola cultivar, Tower, was released in 1974. The term “canola” — CANadian Oil Low Acid — was trademarked by the Western Canadian Oilseed Crushers Association in 1978 and describes rapeseed genetically low in erucic acid and glucosinolates.
1435 2018-04-03 20:48:08 What oil pattern? Approach is slow and a bit canker on release so would it be safe to say a good med oil ball for house shots but not for something like Vegas sweeps?

1437 2018-04-03 20:47:59 @andrearadri I think its time you had a rethink about that better squad comment. Get the chequebook out son or sell up to someone with a few oil fields. #lufc

1443 2018-04-03 20:47:13 Retweeted Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris):

Everyone has the right to breathe clean air. That is not a radical idea. Yet this Administration has decided to side with Big Oil companies by weakening fuel emission standards. We must fight back.
1444 2018-04-03 20:47:13 Have no doubt they are in cahoots.  This goes back to right before the election when 19 % of rosnet oil was given/sold to an anonymous party. It's why Rex Tillerson was brought in.  He failed though, he turned against Putin, so he had to go.  He is capable & so are his sycophants
1445 2018-04-03 20:47:03 Suncream I'm as white as Orlaf so I will burn!! I always use a body lotion after a wash to cool my skin down and give it extra moisture, Hair wise I stick to a hair oil and if days are bad a summer hat. I also drink plenty of water x x
1446 2018-04-03 20:46:49 I agree, however oil at an all time high was Harper's saving grace. The Alberta NDP wasn't so lucky and pulled this province out of its slump even with oil at ~$50/barrel. Alberta's economy is now the fastest growing in Canada (4.5%), meaning more jobs, and higher incomes. #ableg

1449 2018-04-03 20:46:08 You should do babe, have you tried putting a couple of drops of olive oil in it? That’s what my dr recommended & it worked for me
1450 2018-04-03 20:46:01 More reason to use Canadian oil, instead of these spill-prone foreign producers.
1451 2018-04-03 20:45:51 I’m glad I went to go get my oil changed today! Turns out there was a ladies day discount on Tuesdays
1452 2018-04-03 20:45:48 Just the oil.

1456 2018-04-03 20:45:43 just had an elaborate fantasy of going to the fair and entering like hundreds of butter sculptures which if you assembled them would make up a golden driller as a representation of the need to break up the power of the oil industry in ok
1457 2018-04-03 20:45:37 The euphoria is gone, reality is slowing setting in
1458 2018-04-03 20:45:36 If an oil company has a profit margin of 6% and you reduce that to a -4% then where is the incentive to drill.
You’ve forgotten to say how much taxes YOU want to pay for the teachers to get raises. And, how much you want to tax oil companies.
Balanced budgets must stay balanced.

1462 2018-04-03 20:45:04 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
1463 2018-04-03 20:44:49 I see. The Arbequina classification of olive oil I hear is the best among the three that Seka offers. Is this hearsay true? ><
1464 2018-04-03 20:44:46 who tf gets an oil change on a rainy day , at a place they gotta stand outside ...
1465 2018-04-03 20:44:45 Water and oil just don't mix
1466 2018-04-03 20:44:32 This is peak Twitter without a shadow of a doubt. You could really be rollin deep in that thing, until a crippling oil shortage stops your fun.
1467 2018-04-03 20:44:31 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1468 2018-04-03 20:44:27 Hilarious how we are still at basically 63.50.....just like before the API. Buyers are scared :)
1469 2018-04-03 20:44:24 was anyone else disappointed when they realised that coconut oil doesn’t smell like coconut???
1470 2018-04-03 20:44:19 Didn’t you make your money on oil
1471 2018-04-03 20:44:05 My ain’t told me her husband just seasons chicken, throws it in a pan, and cooks it. No oil, no marinade, just the dry seasoning.
1472 2018-04-03 20:43:50 I'm sad to hear about another victim of palm oil plantations, in particular. But thank you for sharing this article.
1473 2018-04-03 20:43:47 @sullivanradio @realDonaldTrump @Amazon is the new Standard Oil. Time to break them up.
1474 2018-04-03 20:43:43 My friend wanted to buy me pizza but the pizza store near my school has pizza with so much oil on it that oil from one slice could be used to fried a whole chicken
1475 2018-04-03 20:43:39 I can't say 100% but that sounds pretty safe to me! I know some people do olive oil masks for conditioning and lemon is a clarifier (although I'd be careful to not use too too much, just from the acidity)
1476 2018-04-03 20:43:37 @MattMoscona I am heading to Chabill’s right now in Lafayette to get my oil changed

1486 2018-04-03 20:42:46 Great - just make sure you fill up your car & store gas for the next one yr minimum as gas hits $200 / barrel when the Israelis & Iranians go at it & Saudi oil fields get hit with Iraninan missiles.

1491 2018-04-03 20:41:18 Like the whole oil industry, the NS has had a few bad years with the reduced prices. It's just like any other industry it has it's ups & down. BUT there has been a huge investment lately. If the big boy's in oil have confidence in the NS then so should we!!!
1492 2018-04-03 20:41:11 And it's much easier to service no iffy cambelts, no overheating, no drinking oil, no stupid unforeseen expenses in fact the most I've spent is £90 for a complete drive train including fitting...
1493 2018-04-03 20:41:11 Last night was awful and so was this morning  I got pulled over (luckily i got off easy asf), I busted my knee cap and I need stitches, I had to get an oil change for my car and ended up having to buy a new car filter :) Now I have to pay for stitches!
1494 2018-04-03 20:41:06 I'd take some comfort from this if I had any confidence in big oil being responsible for funding the CCS BECC build out. Perhaps they should do a ton for ton commitment. Produce a ton capture a ton.

1509 2018-04-03 20:39:55 Yeah exactly.  One side has totally sold out to big oil. Its a shame. We cant even agree whats pollution anymore.
1510 2018-04-03 20:39:49 Russia is threat to world domination by wealthy elites. Their Central Bank is not owned by the West. Putin said no to GMO's which means no to Monsanto. Russia & China will soon settle oil transactions with something other than US dollars. And Putin was THE REASON Hillary lost ;-)

1513 2018-04-03 20:39:44 Hi Keely. Both our rices are vegan. We use rapeseed oil in the rice & have done for well over a year or more. We are just checking with the Merry Hill manager as we have some new staff in place. If u can give us some more details on where this info came from we'd be very grateful
1514 2018-04-03 20:39:40 Made up for it. Went to the premiere and sat a row behind Bruce and Demi. Years later, wrote a script that was called 'Die Hard on an oil drilling platform'. Fox thought so - they didn't buy it from me, they just stole one of my characters and used him in Die Hard 4.
1515 2018-04-03 20:39:40 change oil nanaman 
1516 2018-04-03 20:39:39 Continuing dependence on foreign oil & gas interests, decreased costs of R&D, and increasing consumer use of gasoline for more short-term profit. I guess U care more about $$$ than God's Earth.Typical fatcat elitists. $$$ > God's creation.
1517 2018-04-03 20:39:34 Every time I come get an oil change they try to hoe me I know it. I’m stupid so I fall for it
1518 2018-04-03 20:39:29 You cannot mix oil and water... Choose one and lose one...
1519 2018-04-03 20:39:26 I hate cooking in grape seed oil shit burn toooooo fast
1520 2018-04-03 20:39:25 Oy, dude, the first picture demonstrates the only way to deal with pregnancy constipation. Those miniatures suck out all your water (constipation), all your oil (dry skin and electric shock anytime you touch anything) and all your energy (growing from 0 to 3.5kg in 40 weeks).
1521 2018-04-03 20:39:21 Isn't this an old @realDonaldTrump campaign line about the  Middle East and keeping their oil?
1522 2018-04-03 20:39:16 Both! (though the oil rigs are a purchased stock vector illustration that I modified)!
1523 2018-04-03 20:39:10 @PlantDietitian Have a patient doing Fuhrman's plan to lose weight = wfpb, no oil or nuts, little grain. Not losing weight and health worsening. Thoughts? I'm stumped. Thanks!
1524 2018-04-03 20:38:44 Holy shit 
1525 2018-04-03 20:38:42 By selling snake oil and not having a conscience. Older white people, rust belt, evangelicals, coal country, Clinton haters. They wanted change and the actor spewed his lies.
1526 2018-04-03 20:38:35 Stop stealing my lines! Stick to your bullish oil mantra!
1527 2018-04-03 20:38:34 is this even chocolate?????? it's pure oil

1529 2018-04-03 20:38:23 It sounds crazy but we used motor oil on indoor go kart track and ran it in. It acted like oil in pan and heated up the tires good and rubbered up track real nice and made everyone feel like superman. No tire monster needed and worked way better than track bite
1530 2018-04-03 20:38:23 interesting...there's a API  draw excuse and the long speculators not interested:) looks like they got burnt one too many times.
1531 2018-04-03 20:38:20 YES GIMME THAT LONG ASS BITCH. Make it an hour. Make it a full length feature film. Take it on tour as a one man show. I need some oil resistant COVERAGE and I’m not playing around.
1532 2018-04-03 20:37:56 @izfidel we need to talk. I feel like we havent hung out in a while. What HAPPENED.
1533 2018-04-03 20:37:48 The oil industry did, though!
1534 2018-04-03 20:37:46 Have a patient who is eating Fuhrman's diet = whole plant foods, no oil or nuts, little grains, and is not losing weight, health worsening. Thoughts as to why??
1535 2018-04-03 20:37:41 Total snake oil salesman
1536 2018-04-03 20:37:09 Ion get off in enough time to go get my nails done and get a oil change 
1537 2018-04-03 20:37:08 You mean daddy Putin wants the Intl Col out. More oil, more genocide, more things that make Putin feel like half a man.
1538 2018-04-03 20:37:07 First look into how much 'carbon emitions' we would have to cut out for it to effect climate change. Then realize if people dont get their oil from us they will get it from somewhere else. A slow shift to green energy is the only viable way to help the future and our kids.
1539 2018-04-03 20:37:00 So now cars will need more gas to go the same distance.  Who does that help? Oh right--the oil companies.
1540 2018-04-03 20:36:56 from our note of this morning: "We still view that trading the weekly statistics in crude oil will have to balance between a large build in Cushing and a stock-draw in the US Gulf".. crude trying to balance between the two sides of the pipe right now.
1541 2018-04-03 20:36:45 Long oil
1542 2018-04-03 20:36:42 Juventus > beans with no oil
1543 2018-04-03 20:36:35 Please, then, explain exactly how Afghanistan, country of many tribes, "opens up a gateway" to Oil rich countries.
1544 2018-04-03 20:36:28 23:34 msk It's Justin Bieber writing by Len's fingers. But if less drilling oil, gas, we'll feel much better, believe me.

1546 2018-04-03 20:36:11 thanks .. and Oil after hours is confused
1547 2018-04-03 20:35:41 Yes - unfortunately snake oil sellers have hobbled the #drone industry with disillusionment. Ag & real estate have attracted the most opportunists. Each industry needs to develop in-house specialists who give objective advice based on long-term pre-drone knowledge.

1558 2018-04-03 20:34:37 You hit the nail on the head in the first sentence..."oils." Hence why reducing any processed oils would be key and only use when needed, however, there are ways to cook without oil. Not always this oil is bad and this is good, but "better or worse." Reduce all oils.

You move an oil company, you lose 100% of the profits you could have made if you stayed while incurring a huge moving expense.

1646 2018-04-03 20:24:22 Read your link!
Oklahoma allows oil companies to deduct the cost of operating the wells from their income so they pay little to no income tax. Translation: there is very little profit margin.
It seems you want the oil companies to taxes on their gross income vs adjusted income.
1647 2018-04-03 20:23:59 middle east oil is transported from the country of origin by SEA, not pipelines running through other countries.  The U.S. imports very little of its oil from that part of the world.  Most of our oil comes from Canada. Venezuela and Russia.

1670 2018-04-03 20:21:32 Awesome - have you got a source for that? Best figures I can find is that at the current rate of extraction we'll run out in 150 years. Oil is about 50 or so years. Gas is about 200 years.

1681 2018-04-03 20:20:46 I cut back on a lot of supplements just to see what my body really needs. Rn I’m only using MCT oil & plant based protein on the daily on top of my diet & I feel pretty good
1682 2018-04-03 20:20:36 They also use palm oil :( I was just gutted when I found that out.

1684 2018-04-03 20:20:32 When looking at sectors, it is not just oil &gas, agriculture and transportation also come up. Who doesn't love food and cars. Electricity really reduced emissions by a lot in that time period. As someone else said to me we contribute to 1.6% of global emissions for full picture.

Either way, I don't trust you and sure as fuck don't like ya.
1690 2018-04-03 20:19:48 On NASCAR race weekends, Phoenix Airport used to have warnings for crewmen about not carrying motor oil, grease, etc. in their luggage. Like these guys always carry a quart or two of Valvoline with them.

1707 2018-04-03 20:18:06 No.  I was simply correcting your 90%.  Actually, in that poll, 48% are for, 43% are against, and 9% are undecided.  It's just that 10% are hopping mad about it. Hardly much of a pass.  And stopping it will keep some tar sands oil in the ground, so a bit greener, I'd say.

1733 2018-04-03 20:15:17 We just finished watching “Occupied” an excellent drama on Netflix about Russia taking over Norway over oil issues. If they had portrayed a US president as idiotic as trump we would have said “nope that will never happen...” Ugh this is a national tragedy.
1734 2018-04-03 20:15:12 I doubt if Trump is serious about withdrawing because if he does the Iranians move right to the Israeli border & then there would be a major war which would spike oil prices to record level. Netanyahu was here just a few wks ago !

1752 2018-04-03 20:13:43 You clearly didn’t scroll down far enough to see all the economy/spending lines drop at the same time oil crashed.  Clearly you’ll keep your opinion that oil & gas plays a tiny role in the AB economy, regardless of facts and data to the contrary. Have a nice day.

1761 2018-04-03 20:13:13 We can create one million jobs in Texas in the next 5 years: 

1) Texas gas stations to display % of oil originated from Texas, so Texans can "Buy Local". Then get the fed gov'n to do same across the USA. We put a man on the moon - we can track oil from field to pump.

They turn down every tax referendum in favor of the oil and gas industry.

1786 2018-04-03 20:10:05 Not an expert at all, but this is surprising given the environmentally destructive process. Most of the crude from oil sands goes to the U.S., where consumption is way down. Doubly surprising.

1813 2018-04-03 20:06:48 fuel oil  380
اسمه زيت الوقود

ولكن بالاضافة لحرق زيت الوقود يتم حرق النفط الخام مباشرة وبدون تكرير من الحقل الى الفرن لانتاج الكهرباء
1814 2018-04-03 20:06:43 Sigh...all the money we have made since oil was discovered in Oloibiri, has it changed our lives?

But I would like to see how much the NPF makes from their revenue collection activities.
1815 2018-04-03 20:06:34 I would!
1816 2018-04-03 20:06:32 Being a Roughneck out in the oil patches, comradery.
1817 2018-04-03 20:06:28 Take at least 1 spare Heater Control Valve! (or a couple of jubilee clips and a lump of copper pipe) 
And probably some oil.. 
1818 2018-04-03 20:06:24 rub some oil on it and then come throw them, that should do it
1819 2018-04-03 20:06:16 Britain first have exposed nothing that was not already in the public domain, they use this to raise funds for things that never materialise, they are the archetypal snake oil merchants feeding off the gullible, even their ex members have seen through the scam

1829 2018-04-03 20:05:04 How many of Nigerian foods are high in fats?

Simply remove sources of fat from her food. Cook without oil or fatty meat. But serve fish to her meal cos of the good cholesterol in it.

Statins are medications that can help to lower cholesterol levels

1831 2018-04-03 20:04:44 That's fair. One of the greatest problems with current carbon price policy is that it is not equally painful across the economy. Consumers are hit hardest yet industry, and the oil industry in particular are often exempt. THat is why it will never work politically or practically.
1832 2018-04-03 20:04:31 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

1839 2018-04-03 20:03:41 Look at what happened when gas went above $4 here. People freaked out and were dumping Hummers and guzzlers like crazy. There can be another oil shock at any time.

1848 2018-04-03 20:02:47 Odd, too, how you imply I’m an oil apologist when I’ve been critical of it here, too. Oil is terribly, ergregiously dangerous to public health (not to mention foreign policy)— but it doesn’t require any downplaying to make its problems vastly more manageable than nuclear’s.

1867 2018-04-03 20:01:17 Not to mention encouraging big oil to run out alternative fuel like wind and solar- which could make more money without destroying the environment (see fracking disposal), AND they pay higher taxes. We could literally make more energy from solar and wind than we use.
1868 2018-04-03 20:01:16 It’s time Oklahoma stood up and started serving its teachers, school children and all its citizens instead of playing up to Big Oil and the Kochs
1869 2018-04-03 20:00:55 To be clear: his example of his "toughness" on Russia is we're exporting oil? Which A. reflects on our policy on Russia in exactly zero ways, and B. has exactly fuck all to do with Donald Trump?

Also, do we not import any oil now? & who in the hell was nodding when he said that?

1877 2018-04-03 20:00:24 Face: its comedogenic which means it clogs your pores&causes dirt to be trapped in which leads to acne/ blackheads. You also throw off your skin’s natural oil balance. 
Hair: it traps dandruff on your scalp which should be shedding naturally and long term it makes hair dry+frizzy

She is not Adventist but trusts me after I suggested oil of oregano to prevent a cold (I saw your home remedies). Can she email you and discuss? Can you help her?
1881 2018-04-03 20:00:03 We know the word 'fat' raises a red flag, but olive oil is made with monounsaturated fats which have positive effects on your health!
1882 2018-04-03 19:59:50 I agree with that tweet though. Fry the palm oil, add diced onions, what you have is a meal of champions.
1883 2018-04-03 19:59:46 The line is incomplete sef. The eater is the decider of how much influence the oil would show.
1884 2018-04-03 19:59:42 Also unapprove BP oil drilling off the coast of Nova Scotia which is not far from Sackville nb!!!
1885 2018-04-03 19:59:35 All of that and development of oil and other projects that will monetize the relationship for both Trump and Putin. Trump's using the presidency as his personal enrichment mechanism, and Putin can take him to the exclusive club of global oligarchic elites.

1888 2018-04-03 19:59:19 Pretty sure the US secured that oil and through some loopholes did reap benefits from controlling the oil
1889 2018-04-03 19:59:03 What are they doing in Syria anyway? Supervising syrian oil fields? Like poppy fields in Afghanistan...

1891 2018-04-03 19:58:59 That’s the one u gotta put oil in Aint it ?
1892 2018-04-03 19:58:56 What is your comments on increasing petrol rates sir?? Is it also due to honest men or due to corrupt systems where oil companies and refineries are gaining huge profits. I'm not negative, just asking the practical question here. If you can answer it.?
1893 2018-04-03 19:58:55 It's the palm oil.
1894 2018-04-03 19:58:44 Well done Skywalker, you’re learning. Remember to oil it once every so often. And air your hoop for half an hour once a month.
1895 2018-04-03 19:58:39 These groups are essentially anti capitalists, using climate change as a tool to halt any oil and gas development in Canada.

1901 2018-04-03 19:57:32 Turmeric cures acne: This golden spice is very effective against acne and redness due to its anti-bacterial properties. It helps in destroying the acne-causing bacteria and also removes the excess oil from the skin.
1902 2018-04-03 19:57:23 Wow, I would sure love to have the freedom to decide what I pay in taxes. Tbh I don’t know who is ruining Oklahoma MORE. Big oil or Fallin. Actually. I do know. It’s Fallin because she’s LETTING and downright ENCOURAGING it to happen.

1917 2018-04-03 19:54:59 what makes it harder is when you have turbo, so many more coolant and oil lines that can cause problems.
1918 2018-04-03 19:54:57 guess I take my car to get this oil change and get my tires rotated
1919 2018-04-03 19:54:45 Don’t forget oil company subsidies, car makers, etc. #tRump picks on companies he feels aren’t favorable to him, out of spite or as revenge for perceived wrongs. In this case, he’s messing with Jeff Bezos as WaPo tells the truth about him.
1920 2018-04-03 19:54:44 Ik for sure we got at least a few marine expeditionary units close to Syria to protect them oil fields.. I’m not sure what there really trying to do over there tho because Our foreign policy in the ME changes every damn month it seems.
1921 2018-04-03 19:54:33 You think the US military would come for the oil coming out of my pores?

1925 2018-04-03 19:54:12 What on earth will we do with all this useless oil?
1926 2018-04-03 19:54:10 The US has taken 3 oilfields there. The bases and extra defences are to consolidate their position and protection of the oilfields. The US is not leaving these oil fields till the last drop of oil has flowed.
1927 2018-04-03 19:54:10 yeah, has to be an oil leak, just have to find out where. Makes sense it would be after it sits. If you drive daily, it probably burns off quick, rather than letting it leak a bit.

Where is the reporting on that side of the Argument?
This is why we need an UNBIASED Media!
1930 2018-04-03 19:54:01 The fact that oil executives were in the room with Fallon discussing what % they were willing to pay astounds me. Idk about you but I didn’t get asked or invited to the capitol to hear how much I wanted to pay in taxes. They put pocketbook above people. It’s enough.
1931 2018-04-03 19:53:59 Brazil exported $14.39 billion worth of soybeans to China in 2016.

USA exported $13.9 billion worth of soybeans to China in 2017.

(How much does Nigeria make from crude oil?).

And no, you cannot export $1 billion worth of soybeans via Apapa without Lagos grinding to a halt
1932 2018-04-03 19:53:52 You don’t think they did extensive market evaluations before spending billions? You think this is gamble? Leave the economics of it up to them, it’s not a publicly funded project so you shouldn’t care....BTW composition of oil sands is - oil, sand and clay - no tar!

1937 2018-04-03 19:53:07 Perfect example (many available) was the Royalty review. It paralyzed capital flow, all for a ‘show’ that the NDP was fighting for Albertans fair share. This took over a year. At the end, most oil companies have paid LESS in royalties vs the previous structure.

1940 2018-04-03 19:52:37 How ‘bout corrupt EPA head Pruitt? Isn’t getting a deal on rent from an oil lobbyist the DEFINITION of the swamp?
Seems your drain is plugged.
With crude, most likely...

1942 2018-04-03 19:52:29 And we are sick of left wing HATE that people like Hogg show us every day.
1943 2018-04-03 19:52:27 So how does it work- the auto industry works the mouth of the Pruitt puppet while the oil industry works the limbs?  Asking for 72 million friends.
1944 2018-04-03 19:52:08 Shape is a pretty experienced group, I’m sure they knew what they were getting into with the location. KM terminal been there first for decades and still quite industrial around it. EV right next to 4 cross country rail lines currently shipping oil in tankers every day.

1946 2018-04-03 19:51:59 What I love about this whole situation is- there ARE, in fact, ways to fix the budget AND give the teachers what they need. But it requires the legislators doing things they don’t want to. Like getting out of the bed of the oil companies, for example.
1947 2018-04-03 19:51:42 It turns out russian bots have made the american electorate vote for snake oil salesman throughout history!
1948 2018-04-03 19:51:42 I’ve honestly been using Shea moisture African black soap for problem skin moisturizer with tamarind extract & tea tree oil as a primer and my make up has never lasted so long without getting oily and it’s helped with my break outs tremendously

1951 2018-04-03 19:51:02 Its not about oil or land for me.  Its about a breakdown of the patriarchal and religious bull crap that has destroyed this region.  They offer this unique chance.  That is why Turkey, Syria and all are afraid of them.  Its the breakdown of their corrupt authoritarian governments

1968 2018-04-03 19:49:35 We don't need no more oil.
1969 2018-04-03 19:49:29 China is a bad actor and must be stopped via whatever means necessary.
1. They enjoy the worlds oil supply without paying all the horrific costs of WAR!          2. They are attempting to replace the US dollar as the worlds oil/reserve currency! 3. They block their markets

1977 2018-04-03 19:48:47 Lifting EPA restrictions put in place by O Bama shows Trump is in the pockets of big oil.Could that be reason why oil prices at gas stations keep rising with no excuse ? Trump getting in on a piece of the action ?

1979 2018-04-03 19:48:10 Good Grief... @realDonaldTrump just had diarrhea-of-the-mouth... how many times can he say the word "horrible"... also, ISIS took the oil??? Were they around during the start of the war???
1980 2018-04-03 19:47:52 That’s a good idea. Localities should tax for property tax and states for sales tax, but not income tax for corporations.
So, show the how much you’d have to tax the oil companies in OK to balance the budget and give the teachers what they want.
1981 2018-04-03 19:47:34 Why do we subsidize oil companies?
1982 2018-04-03 19:47:24 Yeah, the Lucas Oil Stadium.

1984 2018-04-03 19:47:11 Oklahoma likes being an oil/energy producer, yes? We like attracting top talent and companies in these fields, yes?

Once the top talent is here we want to retain them, we want a good quality of life for them and their families, yes?

Guess what’s part of that? Education. #oklaed

1988 2018-04-03 19:46:40 Final 4 was on, so was Celtics-Raptors. I watched NBA. The Final 4 looked like something in a rec center compared to NBA. It's crappy product. Not to mention 95% of the coaches are snake oil salesmen.
1989 2018-04-03 19:46:18 I can feel my anxiety raising a bit...vaping CBD oil definitely doesn't last as long as the capsules..but man, it works so fast
1990 2018-04-03 19:45:59 This a natural result of putting big oil in charge of the EPA, and having no leadership in Congress.

I used to think that only Bernie ran against Hillary because the Dems wanted Hillary, and her silent campaign, to be the nominee. Now I realize they just don't have any leaders.
1991 2018-04-03 19:45:57 Weed to a square like me smells like dirty socks, poop, and baby oil.

2005 2018-04-03 19:44:08 Will you write anything about rising fuel prices? Do you have the heart to criticize the government & pressurise them to take necessary steps to assuage the anger of people who voted for @BJP4India & @narendramodi ? Currently #nymex crude oil price is $63.29/bbl #JustAsking
2006 2018-04-03 19:43:47 I bought massage oil... ukuthi for what absolute reason  nami I don’t know... does it even make sense to buy something you can’t use on yourself?!

2011 2018-04-03 19:42:56 There are two sides to me. Side 1 wants to soothe cramps with peppermint oil. Side 2 wants to combine tylenol and advil. However, at the end of the day, it's important to remember both sides are procrastinating work.
2012 2018-04-03 19:42:20 Arabs are essentially incapable of building nations. That’s why all are failures. Tunisia and Morocco are the only ones doing well. The rest are backwards even with all the oil money.  Money which was wasted BTW
2013 2018-04-03 19:42:16 This is not a real place. Just something you made up in fantasy land. And even if it did exist you would have to be like an oil millionaire to afford it.

2022 2018-04-03 19:41:32 Norway taxes oil extraction massively, and then turns around and promotes and subsidises exploration and drilling. So arguably the one side undermines the other.

2081 2018-04-03 19:34:25 All Erdogan he mention is gas oil in his speech for putin and he said he “will make make top carbon dioxide and then young Turks studenter is studying at university and learn about nuclear power
2082 2018-04-03 19:34:25 Is it veg oil? Some people use half and half - to keep costs down. But the vehicle smells terrible, like chip fat. Seriously.
2083 2018-04-03 19:34:12 I’d also recommend the Lush solid shampoos, lather brilliantly. Haven’t found a solid conditioner yet but will try the coconut oil idea
2084 2018-04-03 19:34:06 Palm Oil ???
2085 2018-04-03 19:34:04 First of all; democracy is an illusion
It doesn’t exist for real and it doesn’t work in today’s world. Democracy is a dream. It should be put in the same category as Arcadia, Santa Claus and Heaven.
Second; they didn’t go there to give them democracy. They went there for the oil!

2088 2018-04-03 19:33:26 Oil?
2089 2018-04-03 19:33:18 But just like the drop in oil prices  wasn’t Harper’s fault - not was the global financial meltdown- last year’s hot streak and this year’s cool down can’t be attributed to the government. Though the infrastructure money moving might help by a couple of points.
2090 2018-04-03 19:33:17 When I start panicking my mom always reminds me to use my oil (stress away) and I love her.
2091 2018-04-03 19:33:15 Keeping the oil would be a war crime.
2092 2018-04-03 19:33:09 For this wk's report 3y avg gas -2.5mb, 3y avg dist 0.0mb. #OOTT #EIAreport #oil
2093 2018-04-03 19:33:04 This is where he and vlady try to take control of the gas and oil in the baltics. That's likely the subject of pootsies visit, besides his long awaited BJ.

2104 2018-04-03 19:32:12 I love when I wash my hair. Put some coconut oil and leave in conditioner. Feels like heaven 
2105 2018-04-03 19:32:09 oh i know what could work, put some coconut oil under your eyes every night and  gives circular massages doing a bit of pressure and you leave it all night, that could work but you have to be constant.
2106 2018-04-03 19:32:05 Think real hard if you can. Taxis, Mail, Couriers, Groceries, Fast. Food, Booze, Building Supplies, Airfares etc They’re paying alot more for gas. More increases coming & they’ll raise prices to cover losses. It’s not just about cars. USA buys Alberta Oil & Sells it to BC as Gas
2107 2018-04-03 19:32:03 climate change is Real and the Government is hellbent on exporting oil at a 3 times multiple - screw the #ParisAgreement and everyone

2124 2018-04-03 19:30:22 they haven't spelled it out--

oil and LNG to a degree sell themselves (commodities) but selling more to China is an easy way to move the needle on the bilateral balance.  energy exports drove much of the '17 increase in US exports to China
2125 2018-04-03 19:30:17 Palm Oil was enough for me.

2130 2018-04-03 19:29:38 Not to worry. Many minds at work re energy innovation other than wind/solar/coal/oil. Be patient. Impatience always leads to failure. Explore other options. Regards (Me: pragmatic environmentalist).

2136 2018-04-03 19:29:15 It’s amazing to me. The cars we drive today R pretty much getting the same MPG as ones built 20-25 years ago. We can’t figure out how to get more or do the automakers need to be friendly with big oil?

2167 2018-04-03 19:25:31 Yes but not by The Ordinary. I use Clinique's Dramatically Different lotion in the daytime, and First Aid Beauty's cream, with a couple drops of argan oil, at night.
2168 2018-04-03 19:25:20 Well.  Being an Albertan, I inherited the oil in the ground...the clean skies, etc.  If I mine “the house I inherited” to nothing, what does that make me?

2222 2018-04-03 19:16:32 Yes. I've spent about 30k on an oil that's supposed to take away my cleavage scar. If it doesn't fade in like two weeks max, I am burning the whole company.
2223 2018-04-03 19:16:31 China needs resources like fresh water and oil. It’s trying to divert Himalayan watershed from doklam to its desert but inevitably will need more. They already started population incursion in eastern Russia.
2224 2018-04-03 19:16:31 . Las estaciones de servicio OIL son un a porquería, no me extraña que Cristóbal López deba miles de millones de pesos: no tienen cartel identificatorio, los empleados vaguean, se cobra por el aire.

2231 2018-04-03 19:15:48 i was looking for books for internship about autism and mental health and there was a book that claimed you could prevent and reverse it..... through diet..... and the author is some dude who wont shut up about coconut oil. hm i wonder what the solution is
2232 2018-04-03 19:15:27 Main engine lube oil suction loss in heavy weather .... that was a contributing factor in the loss of the Elma Tres November 1981 too!
2233 2018-04-03 19:15:24 not really you need to work you ass off for a “french dictator of kitchen” chop you flesh, spill oil on arms and hands,  burn you’re hair and hands to understand the difference between a falafel and pakora. Until then you are being fooled for 500 inr
2234 2018-04-03 19:15:23 The oppression of peoples all over the globe is an affront to humanity.  The causes of the injustice always seem to involve land, money and oil, and not necessarily in that order. All of us are not silent, but we do need a real and truthful media outlet.

2243 2018-04-03 19:14:02 Technology over the next 10 years will reduce emissions all by itself. What is going on with batteries and more efficient solar energy will just keep the oil industry in a slow decline. Not there yet but close.

2246 2018-04-03 19:13:40 I expect a lot of typical oil industry dogma coming from trudeau. ie. the usual "resources to tidewater" and "pipelines are safest" and "cleanup would be world-class" and "our climate commitments depend upon this pipeline being built" BS..
#tarsands #oilandgas #bcpoli #fnpoli
2247 2018-04-03 19:13:38 Agreed. Though we need solar to move past oil, coal and nuclear power options.
2248 2018-04-03 19:13:37 MOROCCAN OIL IS THE BEST!!! i need to buy it again

@GovInslee's position against #tmx, Lougheed-like legislation that enables AB to stop the flow of #oil is coming soon, & she will travel to NYC & Toronto to appeal to biz leaders on #climate & #pipelines #ableg #cdnpoli
2250 2018-04-03 19:13:25 Paving the way for oil to become America’s great black hope once again?
2251 2018-04-03 19:13:17 It’s being reported anything hauled by truck in BC will get  Gas Surcharge due to increased price of gas. Groceries, Courier, Taxi, Fast  Food all goods & services. When Ab Govt reduces Oil, Gas, Bitumen flow in present pipeline BC will be shocked @ gas price Congrats protesters?
2252 2018-04-03 19:13:12 @realDonaldTrump wants to rollback #EPA emissions standards. This will only benefit big oil & major corporations. Forget about breathing clean air folks. There is no outline for new standards, they're still underway. So why the rollback?

2256 2018-04-03 19:12:53 Because the Saudis are our new best friends and they’ve got all the oil we need!
2257 2018-04-03 19:12:46 I hate getting my oil changed & they ask me ten billion questions. Obviously I do not know the answer to these & I don’t want to pay $500 for new wiper blades. It’s a miracle I got myself here to get my oil changed ok

2260 2018-04-03 19:12:35 My face broke out cause of the oil from my braids... I look like dude ass from Hunchback of Notre Dame. Can only leave the house at night.
2261 2018-04-03 19:12:27 Trump even today as president was still talking about how we should have stolen the oil from iraq, which  would be illegal, stealing another countries wealth, but stealing just comes natural to trump, he dosen't even think its wrong, he's been ripping people off his whole life
2262 2018-04-03 19:12:23 Right now, today, Saudi Arabia is planning for a future without oil.
Alberta?
2263 2018-04-03 19:12:20 Can't read captions. What country?
2264 2018-04-03 19:12:15 Start your C60 Olive oil program now.
2265 2018-04-03 19:12:12 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2266 2018-04-03 19:11:45 And destroying the earth digging for oil in the Arctic ocean!
2267 2018-04-03 19:11:44 It’s only oil
2268 2018-04-03 19:11:43 How can you restrict supply. Imagine if you had $10,000 of gold buried in your backyard could you just leave it in the ground. We are not going to leave oil and gas in the ground it's literally black gold
2269 2018-04-03 19:11:17 Harper screwed Canada's oil sector over, for 10 years, by refusing to work constructively on TMP. China concerns? Inability to compromise?  Who cares, it didn't get done. Hasn't been built under Trudeau, either. Blaming one, while giving the other a pass, is worthless politics.
2270 2018-04-03 19:11:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2271 2018-04-03 19:11:13 I'd prefer bricks just as long as it doesn't look like that fucking Lucas oil stadium
2272 2018-04-03 19:11:10 Politicians for these generations live on hoping for high oil royalties—kind of like a “reverse mortgage” so the kids have nothing to inherit
2273 2018-04-03 19:11:09 ज्यादा श्याना बनरा???
2274 2018-04-03 19:10:34 Lemme get this straight: Scott Pruitt has been staying in a luxury DC condo for $50 a night. The condo is owned by an oil lobbyist who works for a Canadian pipeline company responsible for the largest land spill in U.S. history. And Pruitt approved an expansion of that pipeline.
2275 2018-04-03 19:10:33 Unfortunately, Canada won’t be able to do the same until people stop buying our oil, or we stop making it. Oil sands *production* is something like 8% of our total emissions.

2285 2018-04-03 19:09:40 This being agreed, from 1972 to now, Alberta went from second highest prov inc tax rate to lowest—with no sales tax either. This Alberta Advantage was to attract wealth (tax haven) using oil to feed it. There’s never a conversation on raising inc tax (back) or a sales tax.

2288 2018-04-03 19:09:31 Did you hear Gen. Mattis head explode after Trumpy talked about how USA should have taken oil from Iraq?
2289 2018-04-03 19:09:21 Typical, perhaps, that the CBC is commenting on high gas prices in terms of the carbon tax rather than the fact that we are being screwed by big oil. #bcpoli
2290 2018-04-03 19:09:19 This news should have wti/Brent up by $5. That passage is critical for safe oil transport. As usual, market will wait until it becomes a direct hit before pricing in the risk.
2291 2018-04-03 19:09:14 Is the "commercial" aspect not due to a massive FFP dodging deal with Etihad - or in other words your own oil baron owners pumping money in via their mates??
2292 2018-04-03 19:09:12 Firstly, they are not your pipelines, your not transporting oil and go ahead turn it off, no one is concerned about that in BC.
2293 2018-04-03 19:09:09 I Need to buy some coconut oil

2299 2018-04-03 19:08:02 If @realDonaldTrump support of Israel had followed in @BarackObama footsteps & had kept Saudi Arabia at arms length & oil was $100+ a barrel where Obama’s energy policies would’ve guaranteed it would SA be recognizing Israel’s right to exist?

2307 2018-04-03 19:06:54 Ok different argument. But does it include how many women v men apply for these senior jobs? Historically women apply for and are more comfortable in different roles. A senior oil rig manager probably worked the pipes & up the ladder to senior roles. No discrimination there.

2314 2018-04-03 19:06:14 Pruitt is “terrific” EPA administrator (if you don’t/won’t understand science, are a crony for the oil and gas industry, and if you think the environment is just another raw material to be used for profit).
2315 2018-04-03 19:06:10 We appreciate the fact that PAU is an equal opportunities employer. Some of us are highly skilled, qualified and extremely passionate about  oil and gas, we are just waiting to be called upon so that we show case what have.
2316 2018-04-03 19:06:01 Because what your company is doing with clean energy is threatening to the oil companies. Which have there hands in media outlets. At least you care enough when something goes wrong to fix the situation immediately.  This is why i support you and your company.

2320 2018-04-03 19:05:36 And then we’ll all be refugees. Especially if we continue to open up protected land to oil extraction and running pipelines.
2321 2018-04-03 19:05:34 Query: 
Oil companies make their profit by volume not per barrel. If you raise the expense of drilling oil in Oklahoma, what will stop them from moving to where they don’t pay high taxes?
Look at credit card companies, they moved to Delaware to be able to charge high interest.
2322 2018-04-03 19:05:24 My hair’s so greasy that i’m scared the US will invade it for oil
2323 2018-04-03 19:05:04 Oil and coal are NOT  compatible with clean air and water, you corrupt politician.
2324 2018-04-03 19:05:03 Yes, we carry Nutiva’s Red Palm Oil and their shortening which is made with palm oil. Feel free to ask an associate at your local Nugget Markets if you need help finding either product!

2326 2018-04-03 19:04:47 My wife and I don't use FB, but her visiting mother had it on her iPad using our wifi connection. We were talking about the mcts in coconut oil and the next minute, Google sponsored adds for coconut oil from Piping Rock and Puritan Pride started showing up on websites we visited
2327 2018-04-03 19:04:46 Spring is all set up,

2330 2018-04-03 19:04:31 Even the olive oil (not colavita!) kept bringing it up last clay season. #noescape
2331 2018-04-03 19:04:30 Actually not building pipeline will increase emissions.   Oil demand is not going down so if producers can't use pipelines then they'll use train or truck.
2332 2018-04-03 19:04:24 Well we won 5 European cups, and you use oil money and thank you for the bite

2338 2018-04-03 19:03:48 @realDonaldTrump If we are so energy independent and no longer need the world's oil, why are gas prices so high? Is it because you are full of it? Because you just honestly don't know what you are saying? #GoAway #Resign
2339 2018-04-03 19:03:43 They get so aft when you say it’s all oil money, which it is. Again, I’ve got no issue, wish it was us!

2345 2018-04-03 19:03:04 Lol of course. Lol. I vape every evening. Mostly CBD oil. Just tried wax. Edibles take long to work so I probably won’t go down that road.
2346 2018-04-03 19:02:59 I hope too. They know Congo have more resource. But they simply choose the easy economy like oil.  We need more and we have the capacity to do more. I believe that it will change.

2348 2018-04-03 19:02:53 Shame on you for tweeting ignorance. You’re scamming the gullible and naive into believing what Donald the snake oil salesman is peddling. Talk about dangerous politics!
2349 2018-04-03 19:02:45 "The researchers said making a judgment about whether the fake stories determined the outcome of the election would have required a larger survey sample."
The body of the article debunks the headline. Beyond meta.
2350 2018-04-03 19:02:25 $GEMP should have Trig data out this month. I would think this is a easy layup for them. 40% (fish oil) reduction is what they need to beat. Secondary endpoints will be key for NASH study.

2352 2018-04-03 19:02:24 i wanna start oil painting for sure
2353 2018-04-03 19:02:24 Probably down to 1/2 to 1 million realistic. Dems, illegal advocates claim victory and not a problem. 1,000 or less would be victorious
2354 2018-04-03 19:02:18 Why does it take two hours for an oil change 
2355 2018-04-03 19:02:06 Did You Know? Every ton of recycled office paper saves 380 gallons of oil.
2356 2018-04-03 19:02:03 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
2357 2018-04-03 19:01:53 OIL DIFF: 5.1 -> 5.09
2358 2018-04-03 19:01:50 So beautiful, looks like an oil painting!!!
2359 2018-04-03 19:01:37 Regarding rolling back clean car rules, that has a 70’s vibe where US automakers misjudged the market and Japan automakers grabbed a huge market share during oil crisis.
2360 2018-04-03 19:01:37 Taken a few days for them to dry out properly,now's the time to protect them now I'll be wearing them whilst out walking the dog etc,
Mink oil leather care is good at repelling the water so they'll get a good coating of it
2361 2018-04-03 19:01:29 And let’s have a NICE/ EEF body to scrutinise the efficacious from the snake oil while we’re at it. SMART outcomes need SMART specified provision!
2362 2018-04-03 19:01:23 Hey, Chelie. I've used olive oil when I've gotten bad knots from riding on the back of a motorcycle or in convertibles. It makes brushing knots out a lot easier. It's like a super conditioner. Just wash it out after.
2363 2018-04-03 19:01:23 They are building more army complex east of euphrates, no way to let all that oil&gas loose

2366 2018-04-03 19:01:09 No doubt, there are plenty of snake oil salespeople selling investors an expensive pipe dream. But please don't lump deep learning in with all machine learning.
2367 2018-04-03 19:01:05 Arghhhhh I hate when you get your oil changed in your car and they forget to reset the check oil light! 
2368 2018-04-03 19:01:05 I’m in Apache Junction Arizona getting oil changed.
2369 2018-04-03 19:01:01 I wanted to try it so bad but i just read it has tea tree oil in it. I’m allergic. So there’s that 
2370 2018-04-03 19:00:56 You actually did, you support it in many Muslim countries. Your tax dollars (if you're a taxpayer in the US) is going to the US military so then they can go to Muslim countries that they don't like and hurting their economy but also their oil as well

2373 2018-04-03 19:00:46 Stir together 1/3 cup granola with 1/3 cup kingfish. Blend with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with love.
2374 2018-04-03 19:00:37 That may be, but the people against don't understand that the pipeline doesn't produce oil, just transport it.  If there is no pipeline the oil will still be produced and shipped by rail or truck.
2375 2018-04-03 19:00:36 Using aluminum foil can be an effective way to grill soft ingredients, like fruit or fish, or small ingredients like cubed potatoes or shrimp. Use multiple layers of foil, and consider brushing the interior surface of the foil with oil to avoid sticking.
2376 2018-04-03 19:00:25 The dude doing my oil change just opened my door.. and grabbed the lever for the hood... why? I could’ve done that shit my man.

This is the USA that under-educated voters think is best for our country..Betsy Devos will keep the public dumb and the oligarchs in control.

2384 2018-04-03 18:59:59 Musk is a master snake oil salesman, easy to get suckered in, I guess
2385 2018-04-03 18:59:52 LOL AT MYSELF, I’ve been using the @ShiseidoUSA perfect cleansing oil as an additive face cleaner but it’s actually a makeup remover......
2386 2018-04-03 18:59:45 You'll need 666 pairs of rubber gloves and an oil drum filled to the brim with vaseline.
2387 2018-04-03 18:59:41 First get lessons from Maps.. angimfuni umfana ongagcotshiwe uMaps.. he needs to pour holy oil in your head
2388 2018-04-03 18:59:40 The actual price at the pump is controlled by the quantity of gasoline available in the area. If pricing goes down the local area refinery simply goes into maintenance mode. That's maintaining the supply at a level they wish. There is no free market in the oil and gas industry
2389 2018-04-03 18:59:36 transmission fluid, power steering fluid, engine oil according to them
2390 2018-04-03 18:59:29 Back when the Department of the Interior actually stood for something besides oil companies!
2391 2018-04-03 18:59:28 They give all the funding to the oil companies. Hopefully this will push people to make better voting decisions.
2392 2018-04-03 18:59:25 ever since I started putting coconut/almond oil and apple cider vinegar in my hair, I can't help but look at salad dressing and think "conditioner"
2393 2018-04-03 18:59:20 In Oklahoma, by not cutting taxes for millionaires and oil companies.
2394 2018-04-03 18:59:19 its not the UPA Preeti...oil price hikes are par for the course now!

2399 2018-04-03 18:58:35 the Genie should go back inside the snake oil bottles she's promoting.
2400 2018-04-03 18:58:21 The Saudi prince comes from disgusting family which preaches Wahhabism, only reason West supports them is Oil.
2401 2018-04-03 18:58:11 Progressive. Obamacare was a rare move. Usually incremental seemingly small moves, playing long game is style. It is end goal exposed.
2402 2018-04-03 18:57:55 He's right, Trudeau is a liar, but Suzuki still wants to burn down the oil industry.
2403 2018-04-03 18:57:44 He fucked Oklahoma over and now he is doing the same at EPA. He sued the EPA many times cutting and pasting statements from big oil. He has his head so far up oil industry butt, I am surprised he does not have petrol poisoning. He's huffing that petrol.
2404 2018-04-03 18:57:43 KSA rests on three pillars. Oil, which is running out. Their false version of Islam, which has been exposed. And US military, which is overstretched.
2405 2018-04-03 18:57:42 If CA wants to be our Catalonia, I think we should let them go. I want to see how they will get their water, oil and fed $$ to support their top heavy entitlements.

2407 2018-04-03 18:57:17 Thanks I’ve used Oil of Olay everyday since I was 16!
2408 2018-04-03 18:57:06 Better tha. Sticking them in the Middle East and Africa, where they just cause issues for oil.
2409 2018-04-03 18:56:51 $TRCH bit of volume coming in. #oil #pennystocks #permian may add some here. Watching for $1.34 bids and turn back up.
2410 2018-04-03 18:56:49 anyone know how to change oil... i dont wanna take my car to the shop 
2411 2018-04-03 18:56:41 And that oil belongs to all those folks getting payments from it? Interesting.
2412 2018-04-03 18:56:41 Because he and Gourde Head are stupid and Oil shills.
2413 2018-04-03 18:56:34 SoCalGas will begin a 2-week project to replace & upgrade equipment at the HBOC oil and gas production facility in Cheviot Hills. While gas odor is not anticipated, anyone who smells natural gas should call them immediately at 1-800-427-2200.
2414 2018-04-03 18:56:29 What do the Brits say? British Subjects on the island.  Oil?
2415 2018-04-03 18:56:29 Uh oh, the bastion of conservative thinking calls out Hisself re: tirades against Amazon re: money issues, when the reality is he's trying to hurt @JeffBezos the guy who started a company and became the richest man in the world. Except maybe Putin and his secret oil holdings.
2416 2018-04-03 18:56:01 Make the oil industry life difficult and they’ll drop their lackey, one company at a time. Let’s organize specificly targeted  boycotts
2417 2018-04-03 18:55:47 Drivers using their own cars, gas and oil are not free. Time to promote tipping for these rides
2418 2018-04-03 18:55:37 Roast or wok-fry sprouts in olive oil w/ S&P. Heat & mix the juice of 1-2 limes, a generous pour of honey & as much Sriracha as you can handle. Toss the 90% done sprouts in the mixture & finish cooking (I prefer topping it off under the broiler to give it that bit of a glaze).
2419 2018-04-03 18:55:34 I couldn't help but wonder , if I could let all this dirt and oil in , why was I still keeping Big out
2420 2018-04-03 18:55:33 Oil poised near $70 as industry divided over breakout...
2421 2018-04-03 18:55:25 I am in the process of starting a filling station, submitting application to acquire license to operate... This would be an independent retailer outside the realms major oil companies...
2422 2018-04-03 18:55:20 81...?  
 Hi Chris I find it interesting that our EV predictions are diametrically opposed while our oil price predictions are quite similar with you at 81 and me at 80. ( I sent my $80 prediction in but due to a technical glitch did not make the final list)
2423 2018-04-03 18:55:16 Using United States military at the border is as clearly prohibited by law and common sense as was Trump's saying he was going to order the American military to kill innocent families of terrorists or as he repeated recently "to take the oil in Iraq" as some kind of spoil of war.
2424 2018-04-03 18:55:15  you mean a “spiced tomato picante, macerated with fleur-de-sel & madagascan pepper & gently confited in walnut oil with trace hints of Guatemalan hill chilli blossom & the slight floral aroma of a Vin Santo gastrique delicately scattered over”?
2425 2018-04-03 18:55:15 They also all left before the 3 pipelines I mentioned were approved.  Most probably didn't think #Transmountain or #KeystoneXL would go; between all 3, that is 2.5mmlbbl/d of crude oil takeaway from AB.  I suspect exodus will prove short-sighted in the longrun as oil/WCS recovers
2426 2018-04-03 18:55:13 Chore day today consists of long waiting hours at the dmv, oil change, and car wash 
2427 2018-04-03 18:55:00 Lol cut up weed? Lol yea that sounds horrid. 

So a coworker extracted the cbd using the oil and made it extra concentrated, then baked using that. I had a whole brownie (half id the recommended dosage) didn’t feel anything, had another. An hour later,
2428 2018-04-03 18:54:31 DA TRUMP said we were busy building Wind Mills. YA were grinding wheat. No TRUMP they are Wind Electrical Generators & Not OIL. Why do I see the 50's when TRUMP wants to make us great.

2431 2018-04-03 18:54:05 If you are going to be open to Oil & Gas production, at least get some tax money off of it so you can pay teachers and other things the government should do. Even other conservative states like South Dakota are making sure they aren't getting ripped off.

Totally political by both ignoring American ppl.
2438 2018-04-03 18:53:00 Same :( I asked my dr that I’ve been using coconut oil and some other lotions but they don’t work she said it’s our skin that doesn’t matter what we use our moms got them it’s more common we’re gonna get them too son heredadas it’s crazy but true 
2439 2018-04-03 18:52:58 tea tree oil is not good for piercings or bumps, it will severely dry everything out. put chamomile tea on it instead
2440 2018-04-03 18:52:46 Started removing my makeup with coconut oil. So far, I’m loving it 
2441 2018-04-03 18:52:46 Please is it Buhari that broke the oil refinery
2442 2018-04-03 18:52:43 Ive been dealing with a stupid bump on my daith piercing for a few months. During those months i was using tea tree oil to help it and nothin. So for the past 2 days i used crushed asprin and its almost gone O.o i should of done this a while ago

2445 2018-04-03 18:51:55 Because we used to be heavily dependent on middle eastern oil so George Bush didn't want to insult the muslim majority and coined the phrase "religion of peace".  Which is a big ol' lie
2446 2018-04-03 18:51:50 Waiting for you now between portable toilets and the white oil tanks.
2447 2018-04-03 18:51:49 We added even more avocado oil in our Dark Angels cleanser which does make it stick to your skin a bit which does turn me off too. I had to switch to AOBS!

2451 2018-04-03 18:51:15 I'm a garbage fire, but like one of those little garbage fires in oil barrels that people can warm their hands over. 

I may be a disgusting mess but at least I'm still good for something!
2452 2018-04-03 18:51:11 And the money that the M.E. countries are spending on weapons are coming from all countries that purchase oil, directly or indirectly, from those arms buyers.

2454 2018-04-03 18:50:56 I expect he means Wind Turbines? There's a future in renewables - oil, not so much long term.
2455 2018-04-03 18:50:56 The best Goldman Sachs & oil industry executives you mean?
2456 2018-04-03 18:50:55 We can't continued to be held hostage by the Americans, and on top of that have to turn around and buy foreign oil for our east coast.
2457 2018-04-03 18:50:48 Oil production does not destroy breathable air, at least no worse than the state of California can do on its own.
2458 2018-04-03 18:50:45 It's what all the CEO's do. Remember when Tillerson was out helping on an oil rig? $tsla
2459 2018-04-03 18:50:44 CNY oil contract + CNY gold contract = IMF Reserve adequacy math that CNY bears cite to suggest the need for a CNY devaluation becomes irrelevant if the CNY oil contract really takes hold.
2460 2018-04-03 18:50:41 The oil and gas industry doesn't cause issues with the climate and if managed correctly and if environmental guidelines are followed; it is one of the best resources that a nation could use to move the economy forward. Problem is; people get lazy and disasters come about.
2461 2018-04-03 18:50:39 BS, you just gave a nice hook up to your oil buddies.  #FirePruitt #BootPruitt
2462 2018-04-03 18:50:38 With melted oil refineries dotting the landscape!
2463 2018-04-03 18:50:29 US consumers benefit from lower oil/natural gas prices brought about by investment in hydrolic fracturing (fracking).  Americans will need oil/natural gas for many decades, but Looney Dems in CA/NY prevent development of Monterey & Marcellus shales formations in those two states.
2464 2018-04-03 18:50:29 I already have to buy new tires and I drive so often I need oil changes every month and a half 
2465 2018-04-03 18:50:10 Fuck BBC,sorry for my "French" but this oil will be extract from the ground, its just a matter of time, I cannot understand how bbc can be against this project... Madness, how you can acting like that.. Against your own country... I so happy I don't watch bbc news any more.
2466 2018-04-03 18:50:00 @chasingice @HOWTOLETGOMOVIE 
30 years and times up for fossil fuels. Do a tiny little research on whale oil and its history and eventual demise. Lay that on top of the fossil fuel industry. You can't compete with free.
2467 2018-04-03 18:49:56 Shout out to oil pens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2468 2018-04-03 18:49:53 Has anyone started a podcast yet called Pod Liver Oil
2469 2018-04-03 18:49:47 Trump says nothing to show for Iraq War? What's he going to do about the prime oil leases obtained by Exxon-Mobil and Chevron? Shouldn't these companies have to pay a surtax, on their potential profits?
2470 2018-04-03 18:49:45 Literally no one, outside of oil companies and auto makers, wants this. No one is going to miss you when you're gone, which will likely be quite soon given all the ethics rules you've violated.
2471 2018-04-03 18:49:43 Immigrants crossing the border are guaranteed to use more fossil fuels in the United States than in their home countries. You can't claim that oil is destroying the earth while importing millions of people that will use more oil. You don't believe in doomsday climate scenarios
2472 2018-04-03 18:49:41 السلام على وصي ورسول الله
2473 2018-04-03 18:49:32 We can keep burning oil and have become Nazis.
2474 2018-04-03 18:49:26 To me the trading gain is vastly less important than CNY oil contract running in conjunction w/CNY gold contracts in HK/Dubai/SGEI.  The 2 give PBOC the ability to control China's current account by managing a ratio of the 2 (& therefore the int'l trade value of the USD)
2475 2018-04-03 18:49:22 When I was your age, the guys like you would throw trash on the ground and say, "It creates jobs." It was the 80s. Reagan was president and instead of getting off our addiction to foreign oil, we started buying SUVs.

I've never been so hopeful about the world. Thank you.
2476 2018-04-03 18:49:16 Don't see many Doctors, Electrical Engineers, Coders, in the caravan. It's the future of the young, if this is what they want, might get it.

2490 2018-04-03 18:47:47 What does “kept the oil” even mean?  We couldn’t physically transport it all, obviously. So it could only mean a permanent military occupation of the oil fields, which means a permanent occupation of Iraq.
2491 2018-04-03 18:47:34 I'm late to this: Did "president" say remove troops from battle with ISIS, unless Saudi's pay, move to border with Mexico to stave off Santa Anna, unless the Post Office declares war on Amazon, but he's tough on Putin but we must love Russia & take oil in future wars but . .. . .
2492 2018-04-03 18:47:33 Weird obsession with that Lucas oil stadium our fans
2493 2018-04-03 18:47:27 I think the best thing about CBD oil is ALL the medicinal benefits without the high.This is great medicine for kids and even pets without the high
2494 2018-04-03 18:47:25 Those poor dumb oil lobbyists, thinking they had to bribe Pruitt to get a pipeline made.
2495 2018-04-03 18:47:17 Mateeee. Try salmon in a soy/sesame oil/honey & garlic sauce, purple stem broccoli & sweet potato mash  no fucking about

2497 2018-04-03 18:47:08 Current fuel economy standards are on track to reduce America’s oil dependence by 2M+ barrels a day, save $1.7 trillion in fuel costs & eliminate the impact of 59M vehicles from the road. Rolling back environmental standards will be devastating to our environment & public health.
2498 2018-04-03 18:46:54 Oil Company Lawyer please.
2499 2018-04-03 18:46:44 What is this nonsense about plunder? You're desperate to sell more oil. You even invented a cryptocurrency to help sell your oil.
2500 2018-04-03 18:46:34 It’s okay to eat fish in moderation because fish oil is so good for you. I still eat fish and eggs. My stomach gets fucked up from eating processed junk food. I prefer fruits and veggies cuz I never feel like shit
2501 2018-04-03 18:46:23 I dropped off my car to get an oil change few hours ago they just called me to tell me that there was a recall I won’t getting my car until 4 
2502 2018-04-03 18:46:21 You left out power companies who use fossil fuels....and many “big oil” companies continue to monitor emissions. I’m a liberal but we too can’t speak in broad generalizations like our current president.

2505 2018-04-03 18:46:05 I hope it is true. That may mean the undiscovered oil reserves are gigantic. Let's see...

I always thought that the oil lobby made him fail.
2508 2018-04-03 18:45:59 Yes, I found these incredible oil sticks that I'm loving. Now that I've invested a million dollars in acrylics, I want to switch to oils.

2512 2018-04-03 18:45:40 I strongly doubt the U.S. will be net exporters of energy any time soon. Canada has a surplus of it from Hydro and Oil/wind in the prairies which leaves Mexico which they would more likely export the infrastructure than the energy itself.
2513 2018-04-03 18:45:39 Wanna know the fucking truth? Nobody is fucking happy. Nobody has skin made from oil paint and sunlight. Nobody fucking understands this world.

2517 2018-04-03 18:44:49 yeah , thats what they taught us in school Chris, remember when we were supposed to run out of oil by 2000 and how all the rain was going to kill the trees?

2521 2018-04-03 18:44:29 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2523 2018-04-03 18:44:20 For me the Mediterranean diet is a lot of olive oil cheeses and lamb/pork/chicken
2524 2018-04-03 18:44:19 They cry about the "crisis" in Venezuela 24/7, but never about the US's sanctions, oil war, etc. So it always goes, the US attacks socialist states with economic war then lies claiming its due to socialism. The lesson isn't "socialism doesn't work"; but imperialist sabotage does.
2525 2018-04-03 18:44:17 which items did you buy & what are your thoughts on the brand? I just started using the Rosehip oil, 
Retinol 0.2% in Squalane & 
Niacinamide. I heard "The Buffet" was good so I ordered that too .
2526 2018-04-03 18:44:17 Still think I’d prefer that to oil money but I do get what ya saying mate
2527 2018-04-03 18:44:13 IMO that's not the goal.  China holds FX rsvs = 26% of GDP v. US at 0.6% b/c US can print USD for imports, China can't.  CNY oil makes China the 2nd nation on the planet that can print ccy for oil (after US), which permanently & structurally reduces Chinese FX reserve (UST) needs
2528 2018-04-03 18:44:00 What is shape of deal Trump team would want? For sure involves lng & oil
2529 2018-04-03 18:43:56 Sip some mtn. Dew or sprite. Do a face steam with lavender and peppermint oil. Take a hot bath with an ice pack on your head. Let me know if these work/don’t work!
2530 2018-04-03 18:43:56 Sorry but you Americans are sometimes so unbearable, your government is pushing war all over the world for years now, created a fake terror problem for oil, and now you gun each others down in mass shootings, whats next?

2536 2018-04-03 18:43:22 What's worse, if Canada and others who have very strict environmental and civil rights laws don't ship oil, others like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela will compensate.

2539 2018-04-03 18:43:05 Just curious Scott; what's your going rate for endangering the environment and human health? I mean, do oil companies get a discount because your salary is already paid by the taxpayers you're fucking?
2540 2018-04-03 18:42:39 @morningmika @morningmika @JoeNBC The GOP tax break gave oil and gas companies including those in OK billions but they won’t now “trickle” some money to the schools and their teachers? It’s a sham policy.
2541 2018-04-03 18:42:35 When your shopping list consists of " length of rope, baby oil and a cucumber".. you begin to question what you were doing that night.
2542 2018-04-03 18:42:19 As of right now they are running oil tests on it to have it fixed. They claim there is a fault in the engine, waiting for the tests to be finished before hearing the verdict. Not out of the woods yet
2543 2018-04-03 18:42:10 RT @SenFeinstein: The current standards are projected to save nearly 2.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2030 – about as much as we currently import from OPEC every day – saving consumers more than $1 trillion and reduce global warming pollution by 6 billion metric tons.

2549 2018-04-03 18:41:41 Again, I just don't see it. This sector was prospering and profitable. After the free fall in oil prices, liberals decided to kick it when it was already down.

2552 2018-04-03 18:41:08 Trump doesn't grasp that the payback for fighting Isis is eliminating the threat of Isis. Raping a country of its oil as profit for protecting ourselves is insane as well as illegal.
2553 2018-04-03 18:40:58 Interesting.  Historically, higher oil px's only increased global supplies of USD that were then generally re-routed into USD assets.  This would in turn shrink offshore USD's, which cet par would put upward pressure on LIBOR, off which an est'd $100-300T in securities are priced
2554 2018-04-03 18:40:41 Also to add:  I believe our neglect is also due to Donald Trump's policies, favorable for USA and uncertainty as a trading partner in regards to BAT and NAFTA, both major fears for investors.  #Shale oil as the promised land didn't help either, coupled with devastational pricing
2555 2018-04-03 18:40:30 Cedar chips and cedar oil are the best for sure.

2558 2018-04-03 18:40:23 @realDonaldTrump If we can supply oil and gas to the EU at a better rate, Russia's supply and deals  would be in jeopardy. We must open our fields and produce what is needed. This will only raise our economy but booster the EU. This could lead to better trade between our nations.

2566 2018-04-03 18:39:36 Trump is doing his best to roll back the environment decades. Pull out of Paris climate accords, pump the merits of “beautiful, clean coal,” slap tariffs on solar power panels, oil drilling off both coasts, trophy hunting, increase allowable car emissions, etc. Congress MUST act!

2580 2018-04-03 18:38:08 Lower oil/natural gas prices make US more competitive. Lower natural gas prices enable US to generate electric power cheaper & w/less greenhouse gases than China/India.

2581 2018-04-03 18:38:05 It dealt with oil. This is a complex question with many answers. Hughes got his start through inheritance from Hughes Sr. when he died which was in drill bits. But I’ll allow oil!

2585 2018-04-03 18:37:22 Why is it WMDs and not OIL that resulted in thousands of Americans dying in Iraq? Word choice matters.
2586 2018-04-03 18:37:19 We have not being invaded. We are not at war with Mexico. Mexico is our ally.
2587 2018-04-03 18:37:00 If the US had derived revenue from Iraq's oil that wouldn't be "plunder" but partial compensation for security services rendered.
Is the US's $3 billion/year of Foreign Military Financing to Israel synonymous with "plunder"?  It must be, because the US gets nothing in return.

1. Pump all oil out of ground and bring it home (like booty)?
2. Leave army there to guard the oil fields so we can pump the oil over time?
Really. Serious question. What does he mean?

2622 2018-04-03 18:34:28 Rather than compete will illegals I let them have it. But it's the future of the young and if that's what they want, good luck.
2623 2018-04-03 18:34:25 Mustard is very good for health, but the oil has got a flavor that I cudn't stand.
2624 2018-04-03 18:34:16 Catholicism started out pure but at the higher levels it is a scam, most of the money made in a church goes to the gold plated vatican, while churches like mine can barely pay for oil and maintenance
2625 2018-04-03 18:34:14 I wonder how many GEOLIGISTS really know how much oil our Earth holds ..hmmm
2626 2018-04-03 18:33:56 Last I looked (having done both oil and conventional and renewable power) the economics of refining and petchems are a little different from those of electricity....
2627 2018-04-03 18:33:56 Haha. :) In a pinch any Oil and Vinegar type salad dressing will do a good job. Kraft Italian used to be my go-to.

2629 2018-04-03 18:33:51 Speeding up your parts ordering would help immensely. Again, I won't say which store because last time i mentioned it on twitter and was looked into they just gave me back my car with an oil leak and seemed very angry at me.
2630 2018-04-03 18:33:49 Wait, so we don’t import oil? Wow, didn’t know we were energy independent now! 
2631 2018-04-03 18:33:43 wait till they ban oil

2650 2018-04-03 18:32:16 They’re just jumping on the hype because you’re never ever ever EVER supposed to put coconut oil on your skin. It’s high on the comedogenic list (4 out of 5) so it’ll definitely clog your pores and cause more harm than help.

2652 2018-04-03 18:32:05 It needs to happen to counter the obscene Arab oil wealth that gives them leverage over the hated infidels!
2653 2018-04-03 18:32:03 The sun rose. It was dirty. It was late. It was 30 billion years overdue on its next service. There was a thin film of oil on its surface, the result of a sprung gasket. But it was up & running, & that in itself was something of a miracle.

Tom Holt
2654 2018-04-03 18:32:01 The under eye area doesn’t have oil glands. So that’s not doing as much as you think it is.
2655 2018-04-03 18:31:59 Cost of not doing it is higher. Why are construction wages at 1990 levels? I worked 20 yrs in it and saw the devastation firsthand.
2656 2018-04-03 18:31:57 LoL give over!
2657 2018-04-03 18:31:53 C4News appears to twist Porton Down revelation about Russia Novichok lie which was designed to undermine Russian support for Iran & Syria to prevent more land, oil & gas theft in the ME. And attacks Corbyn for attending the Jewdas Seder Night.
2658 2018-04-03 18:31:53 I don't think it is about ISIS or the troops.  It is only about the oil fields Putin can take once the troops have left.
2659 2018-04-03 18:31:51 Should have kept the oil??? That would have been a war crime, no?
2660 2018-04-03 18:31:18 patiently waiting for my oil pan and drive shaft so the e28 can get back on the road 
2661 2018-04-03 18:31:16 Olive oil should not be used for cooking at all but only salads
2662 2018-04-03 18:31:14 i probably never will get the chance to but i want to mess with oil paints again. Maybe Some Day.
2663 2018-04-03 18:31:13 They want to get rid of regulations so we have to buy more oil and gas, forcing the US to drill off of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts..which in turn will line the pockets of all of Trump’s friends. We are not stupid! I hope you can see this trend too!
2664 2018-04-03 18:31:12 "Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! lt is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather."
2665 2018-04-03 18:31:00 Domestic oil industry has grown to be number one producer in the world & has created most of the new jobs in US economy in last ten yrs.  OPEC is cutting production to raise prices (u may have noticed gas prices r higher). Lower oil prices hurt enemies Russia/Iran but help China.
2666 2018-04-03 18:30:40 It's tasty and healthy too. Better than Olive oil

2670 2018-04-03 18:30:23 Basically EPA is doing what Big Oil wanted......drive down RIN prices and guess it doesn't matter how big or small you are nor how much money you've made in the last year!

2672 2018-04-03 18:30:16 The only reason there are troops in the middle east is because of all the oil there, which is what we have gotten out of it.

2675 2018-04-03 18:30:09 Seems to me this is a long standing issue.  Neither pro, nor anti, Liberal, but ignoring basic reality doesn't make the situation easier to resolve. It's a Canada thing, as 10 years of Conservative, big oil backed, government accomplished nothing, either.

2679 2018-04-03 18:29:40 There are many issues with Russia in its current state, but non-existent American collusion with them isn't one of them. This Baltic summit confirms this. It'll be great to see our nation orient energy deals with the Baltics to help them cut their reliance on Russian gas and oil.

2699 2018-04-03 18:28:20 He is bringing back the use of seismic air guns for oil prospecting in the ocean.   Blows out the ear drums or whale dolphins and sea turtles and kills them. How sad is that. Just one of the horrible things he is doing to destroy the planet

2707 2018-04-03 18:27:35 Would it be bad form to point to your mentor telling us why the iPhone was not disruptive?

I enjoy your writing very much but you are wrong here.

Or maybe I’m just hopeful..

2717 2018-04-03 18:26:34 I hate the taste of it and generally bake everything /w olive oil. Would only ever use butter in cakes/cookies, which I’m far too lazy to bake from scratch :p
2718 2018-04-03 18:26:27 are they free from palm oil?
2719 2018-04-03 18:26:24 Careful with Algae. Solazyme didn't do so well, but they were primarily focused on biofuels and went down when oil dropped. Food based algal oils could be big. Especially if they can compete against soy and palm oil.
2720 2018-04-03 18:26:16 The current standards are projected to save nearly 2.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2030 – about as much as we currently import from OPEC every day –  saving consumers more than $1 trillion and reduce global warming pollution by 6 billion metric tons.
2721 2018-04-03 18:26:08 GP's seem to plead ignorance on the benefit of CBD oil. It's sold as a food supplement at health food shops. It has changed my life now the Cronic pain is managed.

2735 2018-04-03 18:23:16 I swear Google is in the pocket of big oil. Every time I use Google maps and their directions, they guide me through every known construction zone in the general area.
2736 2018-04-03 18:22:57 This is complete BS.  What's the message here?  Do you know who the major oil exporter to the US is?  Do you know basic arithmetic?

2748 2018-04-03 18:21:51 By chastising President Trump for saying we should have kept the Iraqi oil [but did not], you are calling all those like @CindySheehan who said “no blood for oil” either liars or fools.
History shows the invasion was not to steal Iraqi oil.
2749 2018-04-03 18:21:45 I had so many questions and realize there us no help.  I've got it and have to learn to live with it. Such a shock to find myself in pain so bad I could hardly walk. GP dozed me up into a zombie but couldn't relieve the pain. Then I tried CBD oil and I have my life back #amazing
2750 2018-04-03 18:21:43 Indiana allows for the sale of low THC CBD oil. Gov Holcomb HATES this & needs to be VOTED OUT ! SUPPORT JIM LUCAS as he is trying to LEGALIZE marijuana for all that need it !! Support @CanonForIndiana and others that are for legalization !

2757 2018-04-03 18:21:08 we're exporting the oil we frack derive from fracking allowing large corps to destroy the land we live in. It's not like you can pick it up and mail it home. We have a huge surplus here, someone explain all this too me cause I'm confused....
2758 2018-04-03 18:20:59 I’m told there are more than 450 active rigs in SW Texas and New Mexico—which is high for where the price of oil is. We’re exporting oil for the first time. Threat of Saudis oil drying up
2759 2018-04-03 18:20:47 Trump: "We should have kept the oil" -on Iraq

Husband: "What? - are we pirates now?"

And a host of 4 letter words followed
2760 2018-04-03 18:20:38 This tweet lol yahani heta"Real man Dnt use groundnut oil to fry eggs,dey use petrol" n i was like WTF 
2761 2018-04-03 18:20:37 Yeah and that competitor will be Chinese. From roads, oil, and now power. Soon, you will have no country. Uganda will be no more.
2762 2018-04-03 18:20:33 I disagree. Citgo gas is Venezuela owned. They also provided Home Heating Oil for Americans for yrs. Two faced political stunts
2763 2018-04-03 18:20:30 @realDonaldTrump Go Oklahoma teachers!  This state has given so much tax cut to the 1% and oil business, many schools can only be opened four days a week.  Total failure in America taking care of the 1% at the cost of our kids and their future. Shame on you Oklahoma Republicans.
2764 2018-04-03 18:20:23 พวกเขาไม่รู้สึกอะไรกันเลยหรอ สิ่งที่กูทำลงไปเนี่ย ยังโทษตัวเองชิปหาย ละกว่าจะกล้าทำแบบนั่นไป นั่งความคิดตีกันตั้งหลายวัน
2765 2018-04-03 18:20:18 Yesterday and tomorrow are especially important for the Oil sector. Adding some risk ... Err ..  a LOT of risk. ES has been a good hedge for E&P equities lately.  #oott I'll do all my buying 10 minutes before the close. especially the high short interest stuff.
2766 2018-04-03 18:20:14 This essential oil combo Fran put us on to will really have you knocked in 20 mins tops
2767 2018-04-03 18:20:08 The amazing thing is Fat Tony is an olive oil guy... not a butter guy... so he must be consuming a whole lot more material than normal.
2768 2018-04-03 18:20:05 Defending the borders is the primary function of military. Mexico could invade and We would be helpless? 
2769 2018-04-03 18:20:04 There's not all that much oil to get excited about - but if the Yanks deprive Damascus of oil, water & agricultural land it maintains instability & spoils Russia's & Iran's victory. They don't care about SDF, avg people, human rights or democracy - only bleeding Russia & Iran.
2770 2018-04-03 18:19:45 Sorry was that no to AB oil to BC? OK US oil to BC not AB.
2771 2018-04-03 18:19:39 to be clear, no one in this cohort, from trump on down, is worse than i think. i've been woke to the bottomless evils of conservatives, evangelicals, gop, big oil, mercers, kochs, etc.
2772 2018-04-03 18:19:25 dari dok baca journal pasal oil price ni, last2 aku bg lecture kt muiz pasal dota 
2773 2018-04-03 18:19:24 That explains Russia's cooperation with Iran in Syria. The geopolitical quid pro quo for enabling Iran's support of Assad is Russian development of Iranian oil projects. Time to track IRGC payoffs to Putin and his personal circle.
2774 2018-04-03 18:19:01 Gosh !

FRENCH REPUBLIC PRESIDENT wants IRAN NATURAL RESOURCE OIL RESERVES DEAL and HIS LORDSHIP cannot even FEED ONE TIME MEAL in accordance with beliefs of PRESIDENT of IRAN, Republic of IRAN !

and YOU DISAGREE :)

i mean you agree to what your GASOLINE CAR needs not humans )
2775 2018-04-03 18:18:59 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2776 2018-04-03 18:18:56 There should be more tax incentives for investments in alternative fuels like there were tax shelters back in the 60s for oil exploration
2777 2018-04-03 18:18:54 I don't like judging 1 plant against another...the RCMP can not be allowed to rewrite laws. Period. Acrylamide can also be produced in making oil from Canna leaves, also baked beans, any grilled meat, granola bars etc. It is produced in the cooking process of any plant or grains.
2778 2018-04-03 18:18:52 Everything tastes better with a little coconut oil
2779 2018-04-03 18:18:49 What a minute don't brush over Trump still saying we should have kept Iraq oil. That's against international law.
2780 2018-04-03 18:18:42 You're an oil industry stooge.
2781 2018-04-03 18:18:40 I think I will turn off CNBC now.  If I don't watch our duly elected Head of State perseverate on things like not having "kept the oil in Iraq", the Nato deadbeats, etc. etc. talking about "fake news".  I guess the world will not come to an end.
2782 2018-04-03 18:18:35 I also think the EPA is reverting to outdated policies favoring oil and gas industries at the expense of public health and deaccelerating climate change
2783 2018-04-03 18:18:32 After a nice hot shower, rub coconut oil all over your body

2785 2018-04-03 18:18:25 CNN   Trump saying we should have kept the oil ! How Outrageous Of Trump saying that we should have kept the oil Yhe oil isn’t his in the first place ! That is called STEALING But Trump STEALS ANYWAY,Trump Cons Small Businesses,He IS A CON ARTIST.A Bully.SHAME!!FAKE
2786 2018-04-03 18:18:22 What’s wrong with renewable energy Mr. “President”? @POTUS ? So Oil lines not only @EPAScottPruitt pocket but yours too? #Corruption #BoughtAndPaidForByOil #ExxonLobbying #ActOnClimate #Trump #WorstPresidentEver #climatechange #PutinsPuppet #Renewables #climatechange
2787 2018-04-03 18:18:15 “Should have kept the oil...” says @realDonaldTrump ~~

This moron proudly proclaims his desire to be an international war criminal~ just like his daddy Vlad.

Going to war to claim another country’s resources has been considered criminal since the last time The Nazis did it.
2788 2018-04-03 18:17:57 actually,i am lying.we've been on rations since world war one...we have powdered milk though,i find that if you mix a little salt in it,add some cooking oil,then leave it for a few days out on the window it turns out ok. you get use to these things

2791 2018-04-03 18:17:47 Trump on Iraq's oil- "We should've kept it."  The fat, orange imbecile doesn't realize that violates our laws, Iraq's law & International law & treaties we're parties to. Or worse- he doesn't care. He's a one- moron criminal enterprise.
2792 2018-04-03 18:17:38 More Trump lies on windmills, oil, NATO, Russia, and Putin. Pathetic that POTUS' view on windmills are informed about his petty dispute with Scotland and his golf course.
2793 2018-04-03 18:17:34 can people stop putting coconut oil in absolutely EVERYTHING
2794 2018-04-03 18:17:33 @realDonaldTrump why should we get Iraq's oil? We invaded their country on trumped up charges. We owe them for releasing holy hell on them for Saudia Arabia's crimes against us on 9/11.
2795 2018-04-03 18:17:33 Then do something.  You are a such a slow  leader.  Use this opportunity to create nation wide stir.  Oil prices  record high.  Come to street and protest.  The way NDA did.  Prople are angry.
2796 2018-04-03 18:17:32 It isn't that simple.  Nothing ever is.  We are so indebted to the middle east for oil supply we can't leave it alone.  Syria I think is a little different because of genocide and ISIS.  But again we are reaping what we've shown in the region.
2797 2018-04-03 18:17:26 Data is the new oil only if delivers a great average to your company’s digital bandwagon. Else data is just plain water spilled all over the place #bigdata #data #AI #Analytics #digital
2798 2018-04-03 18:17:24 I think he said we kept the oil from Isis.

2800 2018-04-03 18:17:17 That's the little bit that Surprises me. This issue about cartels has always been present in our oil Sector.
2801 2018-04-03 18:17:15 Wait, we're planning to drill for oil in Syria? That's new, right?

Just hope former ABL'er Kevin Kiermaier doesn't have bad things happen to folk at home in a vacuum of thirsty admiration.
2808 2018-04-03 18:16:43 Oil and gas production actually increased under Obama. Yes, he also pushed renewables a good deal but the oil companies did gangbusters under his watch. Baltic.

2812 2018-04-03 18:16:29 Trump again claims nobody has been tougher on Russia than he has.

Says he is into oil and gas, unlike his (pls check recording) opponent (?) who was into windmills.
2813 2018-04-03 18:16:28 Please don’t ask me to do anything extra  I hate changing my oil without h
2814 2018-04-03 18:16:27 Oil prices
2815 2018-04-03 18:16:25 "We have very horrible horrible and unsafe laws" - "We should have kept the oil, we didn't keep the oil" - "NATO was delinquent, they were not paying"  

Clearly, we have an imbecile in the White House.
2816 2018-04-03 18:16:23 This way he can get more kick backs from the oil & gas industry.
2817 2018-04-03 18:16:22 @CNN Wow, forced myself to listen to #ComradeTrump answer to first question.
1. Is Mexico breaking up caravan? Did he answer if he is going to put troops on border?
2. “Isis got all the oil.” Huh? Oil revenues yes, but how many oil fields did they control?
2818 2018-04-03 18:16:08 Rolling back regulations is a great talking point for those who dislike them, but hiring an interior with oil and gas ties to monitor the environment it’s tasked with protecting seems a bit contradictory. Truthfully, it’s like hiring a fox to guard the hens? Why not progress?
2819 2018-04-03 18:16:04 If facts mattered to Trumpers America wouldn`t have elected a snake oil salesman.

2822 2018-04-03 18:15:52 Blimey... I just had almonds (not the oil) 15 seconds ago.....
2823 2018-04-03 18:15:51 Take the booty! Take their OIL! His favorite threat. The President of the United States of America is an extortionist & pirate. 
2824 2018-04-03 18:15:50 #OOTT Absent Pruitt putting forth some proposal to reform RFS, is today's waiver an end-run around what would prove to be a difficult, and undoubtedly convoluted & ineffective, regulatory battle between the corn states & oil lobby, in order to grant relief to refiners?

Do you see the word "soy" anywhere in there? 

This is not an accident.
2826 2018-04-03 18:15:29 I am listening to Trump "play dictator" again. He just spent 1.5 TRILLION dollars which also gave big business OUR tax money. This Trump saying he's tough on Russia is such a bold faced lie. Why are we exporting oil when our gas in Oregon is over 3 dollars a gallon? It's wrong.
2827 2018-04-03 18:15:22 RT @LivingSafely: Eating Propyl Alcohol this April? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.

2830 2018-04-03 18:15:11 Depends on how you ask the question.  Trumps point was Iraq is oil rich and should repay the US for the security we provided.  Simple at that.  He says "take the oil" to get the media to focus on the problem.  #MAGA
2831 2018-04-03 18:15:06 buying this diffuser was the best decision. my nose has opened up so much! i mixed orange and eucalyptus oil
2832 2018-04-03 18:15:01 Higher taxes make it harder for families to send their children to private schools.

Capital gains taxes mean less jobs are created.  More unemployment.

Oil & Gas taxes mean less investment money for startups.  Less money all around.
2833 2018-04-03 18:14:57 Trump calls for “keeping the oil,” which would have been timely 15 or 20 years ago.
2834 2018-04-03 18:14:44 Thank God sm protest z there.Please request s.irani to participate as last time she was vry vocal on oil price.Not interestd perhaps now.

2836 2018-04-03 18:14:26 This article doesn’t reflect properly. Being on a vegetarian diet isn’t the cause of what they’re outlining. They’re basing it on already unhealthy things like vegetable oil.
2837 2018-04-03 18:14:26 He's also talking about "keeping the oil" again. Simply unreal.

2840 2018-04-03 18:14:16 SNIFF, SNIFF, SNIFF @realDonaldTrump cannot speak a LIE without sniffing.  "Very soon, quickly, in the near future, we will make a decision "?   WTF. He DIESNT even know what he's talking about .  "Keep the oil".  WTF ? @donlemon @JoyAnnReid @BarackObama
2841 2018-04-03 18:14:14 I really wish my oil changes weren’t so expensive
2842 2018-04-03 18:14:14  trump just revisited his "we should have kept the oil" embarrassing, ridiculous, uneducated, DUMB theory in re: to Iraq war. omg.btw, nice plant in the press to ask you about troops on the Mexican border as a way to Segway into your BS NAFTA bit Coulter has trump by the balls.
2843 2018-04-03 18:14:11 "Sometimes it's time to come back home," Trump says, adding that US should have seized oil in Iraq. (Which is illegal.) He goes on to blast US role there -- a consistent position of his -- just 6 days before John Bolton starts his new job as National Security Adviser. Hmmm.
2844 2018-04-03 18:14:08 OMG @realDonaldTrump you couldn't keep the oil dude!  It would be a war crime. 
Jesus Christ please help the old man who keeps repeating stupid things and illegal WH squatter

2848 2018-04-03 18:13:45 Always ask WHO GAINS.... Russia not really. @realDonaldTrump. Has been pushing our oil natural gas.. Saudi Arabia is going more natural gas. More coal is being pushed. Russia was trying to corner the market on Uranium. This Spy was released by the US IN 2010.
2849 2018-04-03 18:13:38 Perhaps he plans to invade Mexico and seize the oil
2850 2018-04-03 18:13:37 it could be or not, Israel created by British aid #Balfour when Ottoman Empire declined & Saudi Arabia rised. Iran of Shah was under Russia GB influence for the oil. Then came Khomeiny & the war against Saudi Arabia could begin, what is still in the agenda of GB, USA, Israel #oil
2851 2018-04-03 18:13:29 Rockefeller got in there quick with oil. Didn't realise they managed to persuade the Chinese to give up vegetable oil used in their lanterns for their polluting junk. Now why are we paying for the environmental damage caused by these billionaire families?
2852 2018-04-03 18:13:27 . @realDonaldTrump @CNBC @CNN for your so called 7 trillion dollars, you've got puppets in your pocket & all the oil you've stolen for decades & continue to do so.
2853 2018-04-03 18:13:26 It's not like they can't afford it, but they're also hosting a great deal of the US military might in the middle east, and controlling oil prices, so might not be a good idea to piss them off.
2854 2018-04-03 18:13:22 Does 45* know when he says “we should keep the (Iraqi) oil” he’d advocating a war crime? He’s an ongoing embarrassment. I’m sure the Baltic states don’t advocate plunder. #MSNBC
2855 2018-04-03 18:13:20 .@realDonaldTrump says we should have "kept the oil" AND "it's time to bring troops home". Does this idiot realize the oil is IN THE GROUND!! We can't keep the oil unless we continue to occupy the region.
2856 2018-04-03 18:13:19 Photosynthesis is a lie created by the oil industry!!! #sarcastweet
2857 2018-04-03 18:13:14 OK teachers should tell state officials that they actually are trying to teach barrels of oil. Guarantee they'd get all the funds they need.
2858 2018-04-03 18:13:09 He's talking about keeping the oil again. He is standing beside foreign leaders talking about keeping the oil. Make America Embarrassed Again.
2859 2018-04-03 18:13:05 World's dumbest human currently channeling Paul Wolfowitz..."we should have kept the oil"

2863 2018-04-03 18:12:55 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
2864 2018-04-03 18:12:51 Awh Oh  Trump is going into his...I don't have an answer for that so he goes to his golden oldies scripts..."you know I told you we should have taken the oil...." Baltics press conference

2869 2018-04-03 18:12:44 @realDonaldTrump oh for God's sake, the #DotardInChief once again rants like an unhinged maniac ... about military on the border, "taking the oil" and now trying to thread some kind of needle on his relationship with #Putin. Meanwhile, #StrongNATO is trending.
2870 2018-04-03 18:12:42 #Trump is mad because ISIS beat the US from stealing oil from Iraq. We have a crime boss in the WH. #UniteBlue #TheResistance
2871 2018-04-03 18:12:32 His ranting about taking the oil in Iraq and what we are getting out of it and caravans on our border instead of talking about what is facing the Baltics. Ignoring the RU issue. Talking about $$. I literally HATE this man. The President of Estonia really said her bit directly.
2872 2018-04-03 18:12:32 Can I Just Get My Back/Booty Rubbed Down In Oil While I “Fall Asleep”?  LOL
2873 2018-04-03 18:12:25 Trump is on TV and it is not good.
Talking about keeping oil, sending troops to the Mexican border and withdrawing troops from Syria.
For the love of God can anyone stop this lunatic?

2876 2018-04-03 18:12:19 Oh my gosh someone make Trump shut up. Everything he advocates is too absurdly simplistic if not illegal. Keep the oil? That’s not who we are as Americans.
2877 2018-04-03 18:12:19 Trump says US spent billions on wars in the Middle East. "We got nothing. Nothing except death and destruction." He reiterates his statement that since ISIS didn't get "the oil... ISIS got the oil."
2878 2018-04-03 18:12:19 While the Arctic melts from anthropogenic climate change, the first world countries are arguing who gets to extract the ocean floor oil reserves first #TuesdayThoughts #ClimateChange #ActOnClimate There’s a Tuesday Thought for Twitter.
2879 2018-04-03 18:12:18 They got the oil, we wanted the oil, ISIS got the oil, lots and lots of oil, our oil, but they got the oil, the oil we wanted. 
2880 2018-04-03 18:12:11 Trump asked about pulling troops from Syria, returns to his campaign theme about the mideast wars. Says we should have taken the oil but we didn't take the oil.

What did the U.S. get from interventions? "$7 trillion and got nothing, except death and destruction."

2883 2018-04-03 18:12:06 He's talking about "keeping the oil" again! What a total crazy freak this guy is!
2884 2018-04-03 18:12:03 Burning the midnight oil...are we ?
2885 2018-04-03 18:12:03 Trump sounds completely insane right now. And, yet again, he said we should “have kept the oil.” This, of course, would have been considered a war crime and he has exactly ZERO awareness of the rule of law.
The House must ACT.  
DO YOUR JOBS 
And
CHECK THIS PRESIDENT.
2886 2018-04-03 18:12:03 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
2887 2018-04-03 18:12:01 Everyone has the right to breathe clean air. That is not a radical idea. Yet this Administration has decided to side with Big Oil companies by weakening fuel emission standards. We must fight back.
2888 2018-04-03 18:11:56 Buying oil pants and burrito bowls
2889 2018-04-03 18:11:56 I bought a car essential oil diffuser and I’m not regretting this choice I made. At all. 
2890 2018-04-03 18:11:53 Clove oil is where it’s at! Lord knows my teeth were killing me!  One cotton swab and two drops later no pain! 
2891 2018-04-03 18:11:51 How da whip get up after a oil change 
2892 2018-04-03 18:11:50 He just not brave enough to vote against the capital gains tax breaks that OK is giving which only affect less than 1,000 people. Only the wealthy oil folks. That money alone would fund our children and support staff, which is what the teachers want.
2893 2018-04-03 18:11:46 Because oil prices are not an all-time high.
2894 2018-04-03 18:11:45 We’re supporting the Syrian People.
Don’t blame the nefarious acts you have committed against the Kurdish people to the US.  We don’t support the terrorists.  You supported ISIS.  You know Russia told us and you even bought their bloody oil.  You massacred the Armenians as denied
2895 2018-04-03 18:11:44 Is he really nuts? We could not steal the oil from Syria.  If troops come home -Trump will send them somewhere else so he can start a war.
2896 2018-04-03 18:11:43 At bilat presser w/ Baltic heads of state, Trump brings back the “keep the oil from Iraq” argument for what I think is the first time in his presidency.
2897 2018-04-03 18:11:41 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
2898 2018-04-03 18:11:40 .@realDonaldTrump again says we should have kept the oil from Iraq and the Middle East.
2899 2018-04-03 18:11:37 And... how does anyone respond to the president saying "we should have kept the oil"?
2900 2018-04-03 18:11:36 To Whom it May Concern, every track on Coconut Oil EP is still risen!
2901 2018-04-03 18:11:36 Why not just abandon the use of oil for good? Totally bad for the environment.
2902 2018-04-03 18:11:36 .@steveholland1 presses Trump on pulling out of Syria; the president says the U.S. should have kept the oil, but ISIS got it.
2903 2018-04-03 18:11:33 Trump, again, says we should have kept Iraq’s oil.
That’s a war crime. Someone needs to tell him.
2904 2018-04-03 18:11:33 Oh, wow. Is this moron really back to “we should have kept the oil?” The embarrassment is never ending...
2905 2018-04-03 18:11:32 "Keep the oil!" In front of THREE foreign heads of state who are GUESTS in the WH, @realDonaldTrump admits he'd have committed war crimes. Well done, putz. (Sorry, World. We truly are working as fast as we can to #indict this guy.)
2906 2018-04-03 18:11:26 I took the morning off work to go get my oil changed and tires rotated. Now ion wanna go back to the office 
2907 2018-04-03 18:11:23 And now (4 times) he again advocated for stealing oil that belongs to other folks.
2908 2018-04-03 18:11:20 #Trump: We will have as of three months ago seven trillion in the middle east and we got nothing. We get NOTHING. And even for years as a civilian I said we need to keep the oil but we didn’t keep the oil. Who got the oil? ISIS got the oil.

JFC. 

#PressConference
2909 2018-04-03 18:11:19 Maybe you ought to read it before parroting something you read or heard somewhere.
2910 2018-04-03 18:11:16 Trump is bitching about the USA not keeping Iraq's oil.   He was wrong then, he's wrong now......but the world is watching this idiot.  
2911 2018-04-03 18:11:14 Uh oh, @POTUS is getting huffy and mad! Wait, he wasn’t able to scam some billions from ME oil? Oh, I’m crying.
2912 2018-04-03 18:11:14 Somehow Trump back to “keep the oil.”  
2913 2018-04-03 18:11:14 Trump at WH on Syria: We're going to be making a decision as to what we do. We will be consulting with others. Maybe we'll make them pay if they want us to stay. We spent so much money. We got nothing. We didn't keep the oil. We have nothing but debt and destruction.
2914 2018-04-03 18:11:14 Now he's preaching from the Book of Bush about the oil we "left" in Iraq.
2915 2018-04-03 18:11:13 Trump talking about keeping the oil again. What a fucking dumbass.
2916 2018-04-03 18:11:12 He’s really got a rager going. 
Here comes Keep the Oil!
2917 2018-04-03 18:11:10 Keep the oil???? That’s called a War Crime!!! JFC #icant
2918 2018-04-03 18:11:08 Right now Trump is is saying we should have committed a war crime, by keeping the oil in Iraq. #Baltic
2919 2018-04-03 18:11:05 They have far to much influence curtesy of their oil wealth! They do not care for infidels, to say the least!
2920 2018-04-03 18:11:05 "We should have kept the oil."

War crimes are fun!
2921 2018-04-03 18:11:04 Fixing the existing wall is part of funds allocated by Obama that Trump just lied about while demonstrating his lack of policy in answering questions with "keep the oil" and "very bad for our country". #MSNBC #BalticBrief
2922 2018-04-03 18:11:02 Balts have just praised alliance with United States. Trump then proceeds to shit on alliances, U.S. commitments as a waste of money. Plus, he's ranting about the oil. "$7 trillion in death and destruction in Middle East"
2923 2018-04-03 18:11:00 Vapes are allowed and must be packed in carry-on bags. Travelers must comply with federal law on transporting cannabis products, like CBD oil. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
2924 2018-04-03 18:10:59 Trump is still talking about stealing the oil from Arab nations. What should have been done. Commit criminal acts while your invading a country. That’s his opinion.
2925 2018-04-03 18:10:56 @tan_luxe are you in @Space_NK Dublin - wonder oil?
2926 2018-04-03 18:10:55 We aren't allowed to take the oil  !!!!!!!
Will someone educate this fucking twit  !!!!!!
2927 2018-04-03 18:10:54 Isn’t it illegal for us to “keep the oil” . . . asking for a country
2928 2018-04-03 18:10:52 Ooh, buddy, Trump is going on about "keep the oil" and "ISIS got the oil" at this news conference.

2930 2018-04-03 18:10:50 "In civilian life I was always saying keep the oil keep the oil who got the oil it was Isis got the oil we shoulda kept the oil then we didn't keep the oil."

Guys, I think Trump wanted to keep the oil.
2931 2018-04-03 18:10:49 Trump goes back to saying US should have seized oil in Iraq during Iraq war: “We should have kept the oil.” (He said this plenty during the campaign)
2932 2018-04-03 18:10:48 "Keep the oil." Trump priority.
2933 2018-04-03 18:10:48 Lord, there he goes again with the oil
2934 2018-04-03 18:10:47 Trump repeats the canard that the US has spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, "we get nothing out of it" and "we didn't keep the oil".

2936 2018-04-03 18:10:41 Trump is ranting about "keep the oil, keep the oil" because he is perpetually campaigning to the very, very stupid.
2937 2018-04-03 18:10:39 "Keep the oil!"
2938 2018-04-03 18:10:38 Trump, in White House remarks, once again says the US should have "kept the oil" in Iraq after its 2003 invasion.
2939 2018-04-03 18:10:37 "Keep the oil"

The President is ok with violating war crimes
2940 2018-04-03 18:10:34 He is criticizing our country in front of foreign leaders and is now ranting. He’s back on his “Keep the oil” idiocy. He’s totally unfit for the office of President.
2941 2018-04-03 18:10:31 He want to "keep the oil"...wow he went pretty far back.
2942 2018-04-03 18:10:31 Blah blah shoulda kept the oil blah
2943 2018-04-03 18:10:30 Trying to help oil and gas companies in every way they can. Too bad consumers! I am sure gas will never go up in price again...cough, cough! Fools, all of these guys are fools with foolish followers!
2944 2018-04-03 18:10:30 Doll Hands talking about stealing the oil from the Middle East again lol
2945 2018-04-03 18:10:29 OMG! Keep the oil! He’s so FOS!
2946 2018-04-03 18:10:29 Trump again advocates for war crimes, saying the United Should "should have kept the oil" after invading Iraq.
2947 2018-04-03 18:10:27 Facts - racist justifications - every country with oil is somehow run by an evil dictator (which was fine when the west was trading with them.) Most protests get their attendance  downplayed. No media talks about the forced eviction of Palestinians. You're wrong, now go.
2948 2018-04-03 18:10:27 Got my brakes done yesterday oil change today.. Ah reimbursement would be nice.. 
2949 2018-04-03 18:10:23 And, back to "keep the oil"...
2950 2018-04-03 18:10:22 Oh no! If it is a little dry when you get home, try adding one drop of an essential oil or baby oil to it!
2951 2018-04-03 18:10:20 "We didn't keep the oil," President Trump, returning to his calls for colonization in Iraq
2952 2018-04-03 18:10:18 And the oil!
2953 2018-04-03 18:10:17 Trump: "Keep the oil."

2963 2018-04-03 18:09:48 Classic case of simply going for an oil change and being ready to sell your house and all your belongings in order to pay for everything that they “need to fix”.

2970 2018-04-03 18:08:28 I’m not sure why you are differentiating from tax taken from oil sales and tax taken from sales of other goods and services. If it’s going back to the people what does it matter where it comes from?

3028 2018-04-03 18:02:17 dear DIY blogs: baking soda, water, and any essential oil is not a shampoo!!! nor is it a natural remedy!!!!
3029 2018-04-03 18:02:15 Going back to your first point: if oil is NOT a fossil fuel, there may be much more oil than we think possible waiting to be discovered.
3030 2018-04-03 18:02:04 Was Nigeria paradise before PDP came power in 1999? Let me inform you Nigeria had huge debt burden, crude oil was selling at $11/berrel, Abdulsalami only left $3b in foreign reserve when PDP took over Nigeria was in shambles.
3031 2018-04-03 18:01:56 So I’m done cooking and I burnt myself with oil and I’m feeling emotions about this
3032 2018-04-03 18:01:52 I need to find a girl who doesnt mind me smelling like cut wood and oil/gas all the time.
3033 2018-04-03 18:01:44 Just add that as far as I know, the port will be on Madae Island next to the current oil/gas terminal. That means the island will need to be connected to Kyaukpyu & the SEZ to the west, and probably also the mainland to the east (which is the direction the pipelines now run).

3040 2018-04-03 18:01:20 The East River has a complex pollution history- sewage, oil etc. LifeStraw products are designed to remove bacteria, Protozoa & reduce chemicals and hv metals but think East River is a gamble & cant say for sure without knowing contamination specifics
3041 2018-04-03 18:01:19 If EPA chief Scott Pruitt resigns, Trump is going to name a fiery barrel of crude oil as his replacement. #PruittMustResign #trump
3042 2018-04-03 18:01:17 Possibly, they tried it but went after every industry except oil and it failed, they came back with a bill that actually passed additional funding last week, but teachers still walked out and marched
3043 2018-04-03 18:01:07 Need a new control arm some new bushings rear caliper and some new synthetic oil. April will be fun!

3045 2018-04-03 18:01:00 A black woman is never too calm to take shit, when you caught him cheating on you pour oil on the floor when he's naked let him pass and slip on it, beat his ass I repeat beat his ass.

3054 2018-04-03 18:00:30 When is the #USOP ICO @Wexboy_Value ? I heard they're tokenizing the 1 billion barrels of oil that are yet to flow, there's a $500 cheque with your name on it.
3055 2018-04-03 18:00:25 Looking for a good fish oil supplement. Anyone on here can recommend a good tasting one, I don’t mind a tonic.

3060 2018-04-03 17:59:52 Purchase at our own will/risk, but Cuties are disproportionately grown using wastewater from oil refineries, fracking...

The recycled wastewate is “tested & treated”, but ya know...
3061 2018-04-03 17:59:51 Whoa. Hold up. People are actually feeling bad for the fucking post office because their favorite snake oil salesman told them to? Jesus fucking Christ.
3062 2018-04-03 17:59:43 There’s something seriously wrong with a state that refuses to tax oil and gas companies at a competitive rate as other states do, or tax the wealthiest Oklahomans at a percentage that the poorest Oklahomans pay, forcing education to suffer year after year. Re-elect no one!
3063 2018-04-03 17:59:39 Oh I forgot all those times the dems called out Big oil etc.
3064 2018-04-03 17:59:38 Was it from oil exploration, recovery, and transportation?
3065 2018-04-03 17:59:23 The Buhari Government y'all rate as the worst in Nigeria's history, is building infrastructure that their predecessors failed to build when oil prices were up. 

Some of you are not just reasonable.
3066 2018-04-03 17:58:41 I need to do more oil rubs on my ears
3067 2018-04-03 17:58:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3068 2018-04-03 17:58:33 Raeeee come get some coconut oil
3069 2018-04-03 17:58:31 @UmaruSanda I can't help but to agree with the staff  of BOST that, there's a cartel in the oil industry which is bent on sabotaging the effort of BOST. Isn't it ironic that COPEC never found its voice when Awuah Darko was the CEO! Hmmm #CitiNewsroom
3070 2018-04-03 17:58:23 So-he armed the Ukraine, increased US oil production & sales (devastating to Russian economy), led free world in ejecting Russian diplomats, closed an embassy, forcefully backed the Baltics against Russian aggression - & never said “Tell Putin I’ll be flexible after the election”
3071 2018-04-03 17:58:21 If I were a politician, I would speak the truth - that crude oil and other fossil fuels are finite and non-renewable resources that are inexorably depleting. That we're going into debt fracking for oil in North Dakota that won't pay for itself in the long run
3072 2018-04-03 17:58:21 احححح قوية
3073 2018-04-03 17:58:14 I'd be very curious to see what has been built over the destroyed Muslim quarter since 2012, or whether SEZ plans overlap. The commercial port, as far as I know, will be on Madae Island next to the current Chinese oil/gas terminal. But presume SEZ will be closer to town.
3074 2018-04-03 17:58:09 This pollen really got my head BOOMIN. I need to whip up this essential oil blend TODAY!!
3075 2018-04-03 17:57:34 My suspicion is Israeli assets, particularly Jones op. But it goes deeper, they’re also CIA & MIC assets bcuz US interests r so deeply intertwined w/Israel’s. It represents th beachhead 4 th US oil empire in the Middle East. Also same 4 Loomer, True Pundit, & Posobiec et al.
3076 2018-04-03 17:57:14 who trade on a misunderstanding of genetics and a cultural predisposition to deterministic arguments to sell snake oil. I'm only just aware of conpanies attempting this for cognitive ability markers, but I daresay they are no less fatuous than those for wine tasting or sport 7/n
3077 2018-04-03 17:56:50 @votehunterhill  and I got to stop by and see it and actually was given some of the oil it’s pretty cool.
3078 2018-04-03 17:56:46 Standard Oil 1911?
3079 2018-04-03 17:56:20 Some wars are only meant to disrupt the economy. Cold war started and countries were recognized as part of 1st world and 2nd world, Oil led to such war.

3082 2018-04-03 17:56:05 Growing up, my best friend was passionate about protecting wildlife in Alaska and stopping oil drilling. She put together a cookbook with recipes from famous people to raise money. She got long letters and recipes from Daniel Handler, Al Gore and others I can't remember.

3086 2018-04-03 17:55:31 There are several countries angling for this war... much oil, money,  territory, power standing, de-populising, rebuilding, double  bank-rolling is at stake...
3087 2018-04-03 17:55:29 Put way to much oil in my head
3088 2018-04-03 17:55:25 No I had not... knew there is lots of methane in the atmosphere. Really seems likely that oil is not a fossil fuel. Evidence pretty overwhelming.
3089 2018-04-03 17:55:24 Not having that one mate. I get where you’re coming from but it isn’t as simple as that. LFC & Spurs don’t have oil money & they’ve improved. It’s crystal clear that they have and why.

3097 2018-04-03 17:53:43 Let’s see, workers get paid, material suppliers get paid, equipment suppliers get paid, Oil company gets paid

Gov. gets royalties, gets income taxes on what everyone else is paid, gets HST, gets excise taxes, and now government gets Carbon taxes too. 

Too much to Government.

3102 2018-04-03 17:53:13 MSFT case was due to product tying, a distinct and separate issue. The closest thing to antitrust behavior is Wal-Mart discouraging suppliers from use of its competitor products in a separate vertical (AWS). Standard Oil was dinged for this practice as it relates to railways.
3103 2018-04-03 17:53:08 I eat sprouts carrots broccoli cauliflower, spuds yorkshire puds mash and gravy. I eat lots of tomatoes and lettuce, coleslaw with a parmo and rapeseed oil fried chips.

3110 2018-04-03 17:52:55 I don’t think it’s the oil companies. It’s the government and it’s taxation of the product that makes it so expensive. Most of it is tax already
3111 2018-04-03 17:52:54 you mean like #Obama attacked the oil & gas or coal or firearms companies? folks owning $AMZN (318 YEARS PE RATiO=#PonziScheme NOT an "investment") think if they accuse @POTUS of personal bias he'll give Amazon PREFERRED treatment (No Bid Contracts) they NEED to pump the stock??

3116 2018-04-03 17:52:31 I knit/crochet, play the license plate game but my fav is a long haul beauty regime. Coconut oil in my hair, and skin,  then a moisture mask on my face. Use baby wipes or a warm wet washcloth in a container to remove the mask. Extra hydrating lotion for my face afterwards.

3126 2018-04-03 17:52:05 I am a retired petroleum geologist and a proud first author on a standard text on strategic gas reserves (a bestseller). Climategate is debunked and is unrelated to whether one can have a civilized conversation with oil company representatives.
3127 2018-04-03 17:51:52 It's a mess, teachers need a pay raise, but they're going about it in all the wrong way IMO

a lot of it stems from the OK legislature is funded by mostly oil industry tax revenue, and when oil declined a couple years back, the state is basically broke

3131 2018-04-03 17:51:42 Saudi Arabia is one of the worst countries in the world.  Amongst other things, it's well known that most of the funding for terrorist organizations comes from Saudi Arabia.  Yet because of our addiction to oil our government continues to kiss their buts.

3140 2018-04-03 17:50:37 Yes, if Trump is such buddies with Putin, why would he build up the military and why would Trump eat away at Putin's oil market share by increasing drilling

3145 2018-04-03 17:50:15 If we stay on track with how much oil we’re using today our oil deposits could run out as early as 2052. Followed by gas as early as 2060. Now coal, being the only fossil fuel left with increased usage, might run out as soon as 2088. #gosolar
3146 2018-04-03 17:50:11 I like jojoba because it’s good for skin and hair, so it should work for beards. Beard specific cream & oil kits might work better. Don’t put conditioner or creams for hair growth on your beard tho, the chemicals aren’t meant for your face
3147 2018-04-03 17:50:04 If you take away the taxes and fund it by green activism investing, you don't need the govt or the oil companies to do a thing.
3148 2018-04-03 17:49:58 @kmcdugle Irresponsible tax cuts and tax breaks to big oil have caused this mess. You people need to grow up and stop treating voters like idiots, we know who owns you and we can't wait to vote you all out.
3149 2018-04-03 17:49:28 You kidding? He hasn’t even showed up for his job to sleep at. Too busy going to big oil offices.

3152 2018-04-03 17:49:17 @GovMaryFallin sold out the future of Oklahoma children to make her oil buddies rich. Now she’s too much of a coward to face them.

3154 2018-04-03 17:48:58 That requires some serious collaborative, long-term thinking. About half of Copenhagen housing supply are coops, so is my apartment, there's a big tradition for it. That does not stop the Danish govt to pursue more oil and gas extraction from the North Sea while it can sadly.
3155 2018-04-03 17:48:53 This falls within the exception of enforcing federal law at discretion of POTUS.
Further not being used against citizens and as joint force

3160 2018-04-03 17:47:29 Everybody selling oil now
3161 2018-04-03 17:47:15 They also know very well that it's just a deception(Taqiyya) coz currently they've to deal with oil depletion that's why tryin to present a good image of themselves 4 a short period of time until they bcm stable again.
3162 2018-04-03 17:46:49 Oh my god, my hair would be one, big oil if I couldn't wash them for three days.
3163 2018-04-03 17:46:45 Between 1970 and 1980, we needed to start the process of moving from a natural resource driven economy to a service economy.  This didn't happen.  Bauxite is energy and capital intensive, so OPEC oil price rises caught us out.  That was our fault.
3164 2018-04-03 17:46:43 What oil? That’s a joke unless you can recover oil from the waters to the North - It’s bloody difficult and oil is being replaced these days
3165 2018-04-03 17:46:34 moroccan oil
3166 2018-04-03 17:46:27 U need not worry about the rates of oil & commodities.

U MUST only B true to the questions to b asked by investigation authorities.
3167 2018-04-03 17:46:05 I buy in bulk as much as possible and make my own cleaning products. I buy Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds by the gallon and dilute it for dish-soap and make cleaning solution with vinegar and peppermint oil (I experiment with additional ingredients). Also buying local as much as possible
3168 2018-04-03 17:46:00 Yall ladies still buying products just for your elbows?

Just showered and washed my bald head w/ organic products, oiled my head, face & body down in olive oil.. moisturized my hair, face & body w/ one organic location. Waste money fe wa? Use natural 
3169 2018-04-03 17:45:56 hav u had hash oil

3172 2018-04-03 17:45:34 Went to start shrink wrapping the soaps I made for the Luau event and grabbed a bar of each scent to test at the sink.

NO SMELL. I don't know if I just didn't use enough fragrance oil or what, but the scents have all but faded.
3173 2018-04-03 17:45:32 @SenSanders he’s a socialist so he has to share his money
3174 2018-04-03 17:45:20 Russia is the best choice for Gulf countries. If they do so USA and UK can not have any business in the middle east. Russia has oil and doesn’t want to have a war in the middle east. This will balance the power in the world. Russia helps Iran to own their Necular weapon.
3175 2018-04-03 17:45:16 Ingredient Watch: Eating Propyl Alcohol this April? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
3176 2018-04-03 17:44:57 find out where you stay & act like we found some oil nigga   ..
3177 2018-04-03 17:44:55 BS. His policies are aimed towards helping the middle class. The rich want illegals so they can have cheap labor for their factories. And he's been far tougher on Russia than Obama ever was. You think that Russia  likes it that we're becoming a major oil exporter?
3178 2018-04-03 17:44:53 I believe we cannot get money out of politics until we have ranked choice voting.

Because, what am I supposed to do? Whether I vote for the Democrat or Republican, they both work for big oil. They sound very different but act the same.

And if I vote for a 3rd party, I'm shamed.
3179 2018-04-03 17:44:49 You know what is overpriced along with cereal & disposable razors? Almond oil and movie popcorn. Almost oil isbliek $14-$17 and I just paid 7.20 for movie popcorn.
3180 2018-04-03 17:44:43 Dinner at an Italians house: 
thinly sliced type of salami with Parmesan cheese grated on top dressed with oil and balsamic vinegar...#MixedFeelings
3181 2018-04-03 17:44:40 Should've taken an Uber instead of the 4th phase of the oil vadapavs.
3182 2018-04-03 17:44:11 Burt’s bees acne solution oil!!!! Helps so much normally I put it on in the morning and at night and my skin is cleared in a day  & it’s at wm!!
3183 2018-04-03 17:44:05 Y EL VIDEO DE LA MUCHACHA AND BABY OIL????? I’m confused
3184 2018-04-03 17:44:02 Think about ityep, Alaska would be the 1st to be sold, considering oil the climate is a lot like Russia’s an right next door. Putin’s in that pipeline deal, where they’re destroying Native Americans sacred land&water,amongst other kremlin oligarchs
3185 2018-04-03 17:43:56 Huh he talks about oil and gas production yet fuel where I live literally jumped 20 cents in one day a gallon, and has steadily been climbing since the summer
3186 2018-04-03 17:43:56 I think it's a very strong argument and paper.  Some of the political arguments (e.g. divide the fossil fuel industry) seem to work best where new development comes in big "chunks" and directly threatens incumbents -- coal in Australia is a great example.  For oil I'm not so sure
3187 2018-04-03 17:43:53 He has a need for shock n' awe tweets; it helps create his warped self created snake oil he sells to base.
3188 2018-04-03 17:43:52 My flatmate suddenly started talking to me about my fave facial oil loooooooooool some people are so funny
3189 2018-04-03 17:43:46 
3190 2018-04-03 17:43:36 I got oil on my hands and it's pissing me off

3192 2018-04-03 17:43:26 Id recommend conditioning with warm olive oil. Has worked well 
3193 2018-04-03 17:43:24 oil paint??? se n for me diz pfv
3194 2018-04-03 17:43:22 Oil companies spends BILLIONS on lobbyists that make that sure government officials are complicit in the destruction of American lands and wildlife.
3195 2018-04-03 17:43:16 Wake up Joshua. All nations will stop fossil fuel exploration soon, because we have to. NZ can’t just continue because we’re small. To do so would be immoral. 

Demand is for energy, when supply of oil, coal & gas stops as it must, new sources will be tapped!  
3196 2018-04-03 17:43:15 貴方はドライ肌？オイリー肌？
私は乾燥気味なの。
3197 2018-04-03 17:43:06 It doesn't work for all situations, but in some cases I'll switch to doing roasted garlic in the oven (or toaster oven) by wrapping a whole head in foil along with olive oil. Smooshes nicely onto bread for sandwiches if you overcook it a bit.
3198 2018-04-03 17:42:59 Love hate relationship with coconut oil in my hair
3199 2018-04-03 17:42:57 This should also picture the auto companies and oil industry. If it weren't for them, who would Pruitt be catering to with this move?
3200 2018-04-03 17:42:56 The Permanent Fund uses oil revenues...you want to use $9 million of taxpayer money for a previously failed socialist idea. How bout teach people the incentive of work
3201 2018-04-03 17:42:55 The Rotary Engine: Cheap whisky, rubbing alcohol, castor oil, a drop of gasoline. Serve in an active blender.
3202 2018-04-03 17:42:53 I take hour long showers and it feels amazing to shave-exfoliate-oil up & wash your hair to then get out and put on a face mask. 
3203 2018-04-03 17:42:20 When that Kanye W. video came out ft Teyana flopping around in oil on the floor like a dead fish y’all said she was “sexy” and “bad af ”. Now she’s ‘manly’....What happened?
3204 2018-04-03 17:42:17 พอฟังจบปุ๊บ ความคิดแรก เออเว้ย หรือเราต้องออกไปเที่ยวบ้าง ออกจากวังวนเดิมๆ ,,, เพราะงั้นขอให้ได้ไปทริปญี่ปุ่นกับโออิชิ 5555
3205 2018-04-03 17:42:15 GOP congress can't change this unless they also go after the oil companies / Pharma for similar or other reasons. Your own congress will say NO to you, as usual.
3206 2018-04-03 17:42:04 Cedar oil
3207 2018-04-03 17:42:03 BIG SHOW HOOKS UP NOLA CABBIE with the finest vape oil he's ever tasted. It's Mountain Dew Game Fuel-flavored.
3208 2018-04-03 17:42:02 But the only way this plan even makes a dent in the backlog is if gas prices go back  toward $4 and oil is up north of $100/bbl. Is that your plan, Senator? If not, how do you meet the revenue targets that touch the backlog?
3209 2018-04-03 17:41:49 Ya quiero llegar a mi casa y poner mi oil difusser y llenarme de crema de coco all my body <3 lol
3210 2018-04-03 17:41:47 i originally was putting castor oil on my lashes too and then i realized they already touch my glasses lenses when i tilt my head back so it was a little overkill
3211 2018-04-03 17:41:42 Not only is my barber the shizzz, but he also makes the BEST beard oil I've ever used! S/o @truebeardoilco
3212 2018-04-03 17:41:41 And fennel tea, castor oil pack, Heat pad.
3213 2018-04-03 17:41:41 I just realized the reason why the FDA pushed the food pyramid is because it's literally just a cheeseburger. Buns (grain) meat (patty) vegetables (lettuce) fruits (tomato) dairy (cheese) and fats + oil (condiments). It was just a ruse to get people to eat like Americans.
3214 2018-04-03 17:41:28 ATTENTION WOMEN: India’s First 100% Ayurvedic Hair Growth Oil With 12 Organic Herbs

3216 2018-04-03 17:40:45 Awww thank you,  but I gotta dye it before i leave, though,  because I need to straighten it after that reminds me, I gotta find my coconut hair oil too
3217 2018-04-03 17:40:32 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
3218 2018-04-03 17:40:17 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
3219 2018-04-03 17:40:11 Tame dung beetles so that they can give you fertiliser. The way it works is that you put poo in a dung beetle's inventory and allow it to wonder. Then it will make both oil and fertiliser which is far more effective then poo. Put it on wonder in your greenhouse.
3220 2018-04-03 17:40:00 Now do you put the microwave on defrost with the foil in a tupperware with cooking oil
3221 2018-04-03 17:40:00 สงสารกุกอ่ะ อีพี่แทใจร้ายโคตร  #คืนนั้นของวีกุก
3222 2018-04-03 17:39:57 We need a Disney princess with ties to foreign oil
3223 2018-04-03 17:39:54 There once was a man named Scott Pruitt
Who was frequently asked "can you do it?"
For oil and gas, yes, whatever they asked!
But for water and air, he'd pooh-pooh it.
3224 2018-04-03 17:39:53 Kitchen floor is like an ice rink after knocking over a frying pan full of boiling oil 
3225 2018-04-03 17:39:52 Because they have all the heroin and oil..oh well mexico has the heroin now. If you run el' presidente's pic thru an ethinicity scanner it said his ethinicity is Nothern African =Arab. Same with Mexico's former president. Ain't that a riot?
3226 2018-04-03 17:39:51 Here is a idea, cut all ties with Mexico. Cut trade, Tourism. And economic ties. Let them sell their oil to others. Let this country know they are not indispensable, until they realize a need to change their thinking on our security. Turn back their trucks at the border.
3227 2018-04-03 17:39:47 
That confidential office document yesterday, is suya wrap tomorrow
3228 2018-04-03 17:39:42 You should ask why the major players in the oil patch walked on stage with Notley and sold us this BS carbon tax?
3229 2018-04-03 17:39:41 พี่ที่รู้จัก คือแบบ ไม่เคยมีแฟนเลยตั้งแต่เกิด จนอายุ 33 มาเจอแฟนคนนี้เพราะไปเที่ยวเกาะหลีเป๊ะ นั่งเรือลำเดียวกัน เลยแบบให้ช่วยถ่ายรูปแอดไลน์ขอรูป ไปๆมาๆ เอ้าคบกันมา1ปี แต่งงานเฉยยยยย บทมันจะเจอเนื้อคู่อ่ะเนอะ ฟังแล้วอิจฉาาาาาาาา !!
3230 2018-04-03 17:39:38 Get some coconut oil! Best stuff ever.. i use it on me and Bubba xx
3231 2018-04-03 17:39:29 Exclusive new footage of an internal Mobil Oil meeting with employees shows then chief executive, Lucio Noto, discussing the impact of Mobil’s product on climate change a full two decades ago
3232 2018-04-03 17:39:20 Owners of the GOP:
Big Tobacco
Oil & gas
Chemicals (herbicides/pesticides)
PhRMA
NRA & gun mfgrs
Defense contractors
Traditional power producers

Yup.
3233 2018-04-03 17:39:12 @NRNonline Our new Non-GMO frying oils are on trend of what restaurants want! Share with them our Prime Expeller Pressed Canola Oil and Excelle Expeller Pressed Soybean Oil! #NonGMO
3234 2018-04-03 17:39:08 @BenAllenCA the science on vaccines is well-established.  there is NO increased risk from the MMR vaccine—&, so, no reason to separate them.  when you give ground to anti-science snake oil peddlers, who want to scare us into fearing vaccines, you put children's lives at risk.
3235 2018-04-03 17:39:08 @MichelleRempel The US S Arabia Azerbaijan Norway Nigeria UK Angola USSR Columbia Kazakhstan Oman Ghana Ivory Coast 670K brls of oil imported into Canada/day Ask our whining apologetic PM why his gov't is supporting those economies=40M$/day r they penalized for GHG emissions?NOT
3236 2018-04-03 17:39:07 I think any instant pudding mix will work! Also- depending on the recipe the other tricks are adding an extra egg, butter instead of oil, and milk instead of water. Makes the BEST cakes!!
3237 2018-04-03 17:39:06 I also wonder why we’re still subsidizing successful oil companies based on a situation from 1930? I sure do hope they buy a news paper that reports truthfully on you so you put the screws to them, these banks, private prisons, insurance companies but sure, start with amazon
3238 2018-04-03 17:38:59 Car stuff  getting my oil change 
3239 2018-04-03 17:38:53 i used a dewy setting spray and homygah i look like an oil slick.
3240 2018-04-03 17:38:50 You don't pay attention when he's successful. Your like a bully a bit that way. Also you have no balls. Ask the real questions. It's how I became a fan of yours in the first place.
3241 2018-04-03 17:38:48 ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING!!! Oil is highly corrosive... spilling in soils, killing trees, damaging animals, affecting surrounding communities. IT IS SPOILING OUR LANDSCAPE!!! Do not support the pipeline; let’s start preserving our environment instead! #saynototheflow
3242 2018-04-03 17:38:45 Getting lifetime free oil changes was best decision  I ever made lol
3243 2018-04-03 17:38:44 2 paintings I’ve done of same scene in Rockford ME-Water-soluble oil on 1st-traditional oil on 2nd. Which do you prefer? I like the first one better #oilpainting #landscapepainting #mainelandscape #originalartwork
3244 2018-04-03 17:38:39 Always roast veggies with coconut oil. Thank me later.
3245 2018-04-03 17:38:38 Debating wether I should do this oil change or just let my motor blow, hella lazy rn 
3246 2018-04-03 17:38:03 As promised I have completed research into the best CBD oil stock for investing and it's at a bargain right now CANB
3247 2018-04-03 17:37:59 Oil white the main villian in the next black panther movie
3248 2018-04-03 17:37:54 tRump and his equally corrupt @GOP comrades are trying their best at bringing forth the prophecy that the next World War will be fought over water, not oil.  Only idiots think polluting your own clean water supply won't come back to harm you.

3249 2018-04-03 17:37:52 I can change a tire, check/add/change oil but i can’t change my windshield wipers and put on seat covers 
3250 2018-04-03 17:37:42 Probably my fav amongst oil majors
3251 2018-04-03 17:37:41 There's no record as to how the profit from petrol, when crude oil prices was at the bottom, was spent. 
There's no record as to how much currency has returned to RBI on demonitisation.
No record as to how much new currencies has been newly issued.
This is BJP governance.
3252 2018-04-03 17:37:36 Woke up at 6:30 to do community service for work and now I’m at the dealership getting my oil change I just want sleep
3253 2018-04-03 17:37:34 Trump said to be considering a leaking oil tanker to run EPA
3254 2018-04-03 17:37:28 Crude oil rate is dependent on international market not on Indian market and petrol and diesel rate is dependent on crude oil
3255 2018-04-03 17:37:22 How about the oil pipeline dispute between the Alberta and BC government.. I know it's a Canadian story but still
3256 2018-04-03 17:37:06 But his faithful don’t care and will continue to support him.  Somehow this snake oil salesman has convinced parts of middle America that he is like them despite the silver spoon hanging out of his mouth.
3257 2018-04-03 17:36:54 Oil change, new tires, and a car wash all before lunch
3258 2018-04-03 17:36:50 Interesting that the drop in oil prices had such an effect on AB unemployment if only 7% of jobs are contingent upon oil and gas.  Quite a conundrum.
3259 2018-04-03 17:36:44 Antitrust enforcement from Congressman Rooney of FL! What about all of the other markets GOUGING U.S. consumers? Airlines making huge profits, oil companies too, AND U.S. consumers are the losers!
3260 2018-04-03 17:36:44 I lost count of how many times I got burned with fryer oil today when I was running frieslove my job
3261 2018-04-03 17:36:34 Be oil you can be
3262 2018-04-03 17:36:20 The PC's made some mistakes, sure - the collapse of oil prices was a major factor that is no govt's fault - the point is the NDP have fixed nothing and exacerbated these issues. Carbon tax and massive debt increase causing credit downgrades have stifled a significant recovery.
3263 2018-04-03 17:36:13 From what he says it could be a mix of Ibrox and Lucas oil stadium in Indianapolis. Ibrox will be last remaining stadium with the Leitch design
3264 2018-04-03 17:36:13 1/2 So the Stock Market is dropping and had its first negative quarter since  2015.. Consumers are paying more for all things made with steel and  aluminum due to tariffs imposed by Trump. Oil prices are way up leading  to nearly a $1 increase per gallon at the pump
3265 2018-04-03 17:36:01 The oil change for my truck is 8x the price of the oil change for my car 
3266 2018-04-03 17:35:59 GIRL what growth  you’ve got a gorgeous brow shape! tj maxx has big bottles of vitamin E oil for only 5 dollars if u really wanna try it, btw!!
3267 2018-04-03 17:35:55 Never mind how polar ice melt is essential to maintain ocean circulation engine, @CPC_HQ sees nothing but oil exploration dollar signs.
3268 2018-04-03 17:35:45 I had an interview with an industrial electrician that works with oil and natural gas and pretty much got the job
3269 2018-04-03 17:35:41 すべて顔言ってくるナオン大した事なさそう
3270 2018-04-03 17:35:41 Why is everyone so mad at me for putting olive oil on my toast? It’s good and cheaper get off my dick
3271 2018-04-03 17:35:36 How tf did I just pay almost $100 for a oil change
3272 2018-04-03 17:35:33 Taking my baby to get a oil change and washhh
3273 2018-04-03 17:35:15 So Trump wants the military to do border control ! Hmmm, Mexico has huge oil fields and with an American Army on its Northern border I would be concerned about invasion. 
3274 2018-04-03 17:35:00 But nothing compared to other government subsidies. $37.5 BILLION to big oil. And that is not in the form of “breaks” like not collecting property taxes on post offices.
3275 2018-04-03 17:34:59 @TeamCavuto So @BarrackObama didn't attack Coal Companies?Or Oil Companies?Or Big Pharmacy Companies?Just 2 name a few. @CGasparino This isn't uncharted territory, this is "fake news" inaccurate  irresponsible comment's. @realDonaldTrump Gasperino said today u stiff contractors.
3276 2018-04-03 17:34:58 Should have included a line that showed how much in tax breaks & incentive the oil & gas industry received during the same period.
3277 2018-04-03 17:34:55 So my dad sent me to go get the oil changed on my Jeep and they told me the differential fluid was black & I asked my dad if it’s supposed to be black & he replied with is your ass black? Like niggaa what does that matter 
3278 2018-04-03 17:34:46 Oh Kalamazoo definitely keeps things bright and bushy with fresh pineapple juice and almond oil to soften! Many of our bearded Lushies also like to use our avocado rich R&B Hair Moisturizer for an extra hydrating boost throughout the day! 
3279 2018-04-03 17:34:45 Oklahoma Teachers Demand Funding for 2nd Day: Oklahoma has lots of oil, so what is shorting & delaying the teachers funding?
3280 2018-04-03 17:34:39 Do you ever think about how cool horses are? I mean they’re basically grass engines. Like, grass goes in. Fast comes out. Most things that produce fast (like cars and cheetahs) need much more heavily processed gas. Like oil, or a horse. But yet, horses produce The Fast with Grass
3281 2018-04-03 17:34:30 I pull in to a place that advertises a $20 oil change and then when I check out I owe $100!! Is it just me?? #falseadvertising #oilandgas #TuesdayThoughts
3282 2018-04-03 17:34:29 So much for Trump wanting to get out of Syria . Heard Obama say same about Iraq . Lies as long as there is oil they stay next country to be robbed of its resources probably Iran . Wesley Clarke said so years ago
3283 2018-04-03 17:34:28 What was I thinking buying a high end foreign German engineered sports car.. an oil change is $3,000.

Get rid of it.
3284 2018-04-03 17:34:19 Nowadays the average is like every 7500 miles or more. My car (a Toyota RAV4) doesn't need an oil change until every 10,000 miles.
3285 2018-04-03 17:34:15 The odour of that food is not appeasing biko
3286 2018-04-03 17:34:14 Thanks! I was just wondering about the 'oil free' part, as I explore plant based eating more and more. This may be a silly question but what does oil free mean? Is that no oil at all or just certain types?
3287 2018-04-03 17:34:13 How Cute, attempt to discredit vs debating in kind. Standard Oil controlled 90% of the oil market (a necessity of legal consequence) from refineries to pipeline - good luck drawing a parallel to AMZN whose estimated to hold 4% market share in retail.
3288 2018-04-03 17:34:12 Neuquén anunció hoy inversiones privadas en Vaca Muerta por mas de u$s 400 millones luego de su gira por USA. Total, Exxon y PAE son las que mas van a invertir. Argentina gradualmente va teniendo costos competitivos en el shale oil&gas.
3289 2018-04-03 17:34:08 Big Oil... LOL.
3290 2018-04-03 17:34:05 Dont ask me to change your car’s oil one week, then the next week ask me wheres a good place to change your oil. Fuck outta here hoe
3291 2018-04-03 17:33:57 Were JD Rockefeller here he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell govt anti-trust "make my day, punks"
3292 2018-04-03 17:33:50 do people not have manners these days? this lady next to me waiting for our oil changes literally just farted & burped all within 10 mins.......#WTF
3293 2018-04-03 17:33:43 As a chemist, how easy is it to detect where something came from by the impurities present? I've heard the words chemical signature thrown around, but most of the articles I've read about it involve complex mixtures like wine or oil rather than high purity synthetic substances.
3294 2018-04-03 17:33:36 My understanding is the President doesn't affect the long term price of oil. Short term, yes, because of policy announcements, conflicts, etc... Didn't California add more taxes to their gas?
3295 2018-04-03 17:33:27 As long as you and others jump in to amplify his morning insults, he may as well be calling in to Morning Joe or Howard Stern to sell his daily snake oil.
3296 2018-04-03 17:33:26 Werent you just complaining about oil companies paying nothing now you're saying Notley is making them pay. Are you bi polar?
3297 2018-04-03 17:33:21 And what credentials give you this ability?  Donations from the oil companies?
3298 2018-04-03 17:33:19 Whale blubber oil, and kerosene. So what's your point!
3299 2018-04-03 17:33:03 #TriviaTuesday: In the 1960's, "Mold-A-Rama" machines began appearing at gas stations. Kids could exchange a quarter to watch Dino the Apatosaurus and his prehistoric friends be fabricated from molten plastic. What oil company featured these machines at their gas stations?
3300 2018-04-03 17:33:02 Oil may not be a fossil fuel. Seems quite likely.
3301 2018-04-03 17:32:57 President Trump told his guests...."We Are Now Exporting Oil and Gas, This Is Not What Russia Wanted'.....Trump knows when to stand on the enviable achievements of President Barack Obama and propel himself as a Hero!
He is neither an idiot nor a Moron but a well coordinated Con!

3305 2018-04-03 17:32:25 thats honestly an old wives tale and doesn't apply to most cars nowadays. That could apply to some older cars, but most cars nowadays are built to run much much longer than 3k miles until the next oil change. The best people to ask are the manufacturers.
3306 2018-04-03 17:31:44 Oil , dry or combination? Formula?
3307 2018-04-03 17:31:42 On the contrary, Shell is perhaps the only "oil and gas major" that is planning and already investing to be there to meet society's energy needs and preferences beyond peak oil.

Nevertheless, let's make it sooner! 
3308 2018-04-03 17:31:38 Hate when I go to get and oil change and they try to sell me like 100 different things ...

3313 2018-04-03 17:30:46 Combine 2 quarts buritto with 2 1/2 pints Irish stew. Add Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve warm.
3314 2018-04-03 17:30:39 Why would any consumer want to drive a less-efficient car and pay for more gas? Sounds like welfare for the oil/gas industry that will blow a hole in our pocketbooks.
3315 2018-04-03 17:30:22 Numbers matter. By blocking a fair 25 % on oil company profits, which House bill passed last year, costs state between $550-$700 in needed revenue per a Dept of Revenue analysis. Would be #Fair Would help protect dwindling savings. Hoping for compromise, not just pfd plan.
3316 2018-04-03 17:30:01 And all this so the Saudis can steal their oil.

3323 2018-04-03 17:29:20 I always cook those dogs with oil and bell peppers to give it more flavor, slap some mustard and ketchup and it’s not too bad. But yes it’s a real struggle
3324 2018-04-03 17:29:16 I think it's warning you about a coronary waiting to happen with all that oil 

(Jokes aside, that dish looks delish even if a bit greasy)
3325 2018-04-03 17:28:40 Pruitt has ALWAYS been corrupt, he literally BELONGS to Big Oil and any other industry that can bring him money and power. The GOP knew this very well when they confirmed him. He is a clever, crooked thief and Trump made him head of the EPA in order to destroy it!
3326 2018-04-03 17:28:38 I have this CRAZY idea
what if all of the bike shops, bike retail stores, bike manufacturers got together to push for legislation supporting their product
ya know, like oil companies & car companies do
3327 2018-04-03 17:28:34 But with modest new rates on fuel, cigarettes and oil production, lawmakers could only meet a fraction of their demands for a $10,000 raise over three years for teachers and $5,000 for support staff.

3328 2018-04-03 17:28:30 @LBC @IainDale no evidence of Russian involvement and ur 30 countries who have come out in solidarity with UK don’t supply us with oil or gas
3329 2018-04-03 17:28:21 Easy for them with all the oil they export. Easy for Norway and Canada as well.

Then decrease indirect Tax , Vat, cess from Petrol/diesel that you are looting from Indians in the name of Developement cost since 2014.

At 100$/barrel crude oil = 74rs liter petrol
At 65$/ barrel crude oil = 78rs liter petrol.

3338 2018-04-03 17:27:15 I never protest and activism is hauling oats. I think everyone should just be honest. Either way truth will prevail. Can't quit oil yet ;):)
3339 2018-04-03 17:27:07 Pruitt has an unethical relationship with the oil industry. He is supported by fossil fuel-funded political action committees (PACs). He is a climate change denier and a person who doubts the truths of science.
Your thanking him shows your poor judgement.
3340 2018-04-03 17:26:39 Dunn for it or against it? Quit giving big oil and utilities all those subsidies and maybe no need for this.

3343 2018-04-03 17:26:16 It tasted UNREAL as well @MarthaBxxx ... Classic chessy Margherita with rocket and parma ham drizzled with chilly oil ....im literally reminiscing of the goodness!
3344 2018-04-03 17:26:02 I'll repeat myself:
People moved to North Fucking Dakota because the wages for oil drilling were so good.
3345 2018-04-03 17:25:55 Instead of accidentally firing a sylladex full of steak knives into a priceless oil painting or your beloved great aunt, you can turn that fumbling fury toward one of your foes, such as the ability to grasp painfully simple concepts.
3346 2018-04-03 17:25:52 I mixed lemongrass oil and frankincense in my diffuser and now my bedroom smells like fruit loops
3347 2018-04-03 17:25:38 You may want to look into C60 Olive Oil it may mitigate some of the damage. There are some great videos on YouTube to research for yourself. May make a difference with 5G and other radiation.
3348 2018-04-03 17:25:06 Went to get Cleo an oil change & a whole bunch of other shit & the guy asked me for my number .... then proceeded to charge me $329 for all the work they did. If you’re not even gonna give me a discount you sure as hell cant get these digits  #discountbeforedigits alllll 2k18
3349 2018-04-03 17:25:01 ok did it i will report back but it already feels a lot better. obvs not a solution for my whole head but nice bit of relief (it's mainly coconut oil and aloe vera so it can't hurt much I figure)
3350 2018-04-03 17:25:01 Way beyond time for Boris Johnson to be kicked out of office. Perhaps then we can have soneone not hell bent on stirring trouble with Russia and Iran to enable more ME land grabs and gas & oil theft. And we can get negotiations to free Nazanin Zahary-Radcliffe.

3357 2018-04-03 17:24:23 Because he makes more money selling public lands to oil companies.
3358 2018-04-03 17:24:20 Exactly. They make oil run the world so we have to pay for their product.
3359 2018-04-03 17:24:20 ooo also! try lemon essential oil/lemon juice, it has this antioxidants called bioflavonoids that reduce scarring (i also struggle with acne scars and this has helped so much)
3360 2018-04-03 17:24:17 It doesn't work that way.  Your tariffs on us would shut off your water (from Canada), your oil (from Canada), your comedians (from Canada) and your best finance guy @AliVelshi (from Canada).

Plus you know that Justin would kick the snot out of Trump in the ring.

 Be gone...

But I was so disillusioned at the Oil, when I got free tix from a supplier to Feb 5 vs. Tampa,  I sent my wife & son, and she hadn't been to a game since Pronger was here. She came back a McDavid fan & understood what the hype was about.

3377 2018-04-03 17:22:12 These should not be used to pick up puddles of oil or anything flammable or liquid.
3378 2018-04-03 17:22:07 Is it weird to use Coconut oil for your face? as a cleanser
3379 2018-04-03 17:22:02 We all know if all oil companies change immediately towards green energy (especially solar power) we don’t have to ‘wait’ for a transition after 2050 or even 2070. With low costs and strategic placed solar farms there can be an almost immediate worldwide grid. Change now!
3380 2018-04-03 17:22:02 im glad you brought up pork bellies in the oil industry because theres no need to support the british empire

3414 2018-04-03 17:18:41 Yup, its about the oil in both military and corp minds. But the EU and US need the SDF to make it work. There is leverage. And basic cultural norms. Avg people bring pressure if they know enough to do so. Still democracies, as much as the money hates that.

3428 2018-04-03 17:15:37 So I have a bunch of essential oils and I started putting drops in the toilet paper roll before putting it up. I like how it absorbs in the cardboard and eventually on the toilets paper and u get the smell of the oil u use @KCKirk313 try it out
3429 2018-04-03 17:15:32 And how much money is the oil and gas industry paying you to make said determination. Enough so you can afford to pay your own airfare and rent?
3430 2018-04-03 17:15:26 Man, I’m too old for this crunch time, stay up all night, burn the midnight oil stuff.

On a comforting note, this week may be the last time I have to experience these type of assignments. Ever.

3440 2018-04-03 17:14:54 In my view the comparison with the rouble WTI price would be more interesting as the rouble oil price is near an all time high.
3441 2018-04-03 17:14:50 Baby Boomers used up the world's oil so its only fair we turn them into fuel
3442 2018-04-03 17:14:24 Not in the slightest. I'm pretty sure it's all just snake oil. Fermented, beer-scented, snake oil.

3444 2018-04-03 17:14:09 right i agree, we haven’t struck the vein yet—but i think all the failed desks are good practice runs in finding out what works and what doesn’t, & most aren’t well-received

i guess i’m saying just hope the concept isn’t ruled out entirely before the oil hits, if it CAN be done
3445 2018-04-03 17:14:08 Harold Hamm and the TX / OK Oil giants will cut Trump off if he gets rid of Pruitt who is clearly in their pocket

3450 2018-04-03 17:13:44 There is so much solid peer-reviewed research to demonstrate that olive oil has enormous clinical benefits that the literature is in agreement. You'll always find contrarian views - but the majority in this case are correct in my opinion.

3452 2018-04-03 17:13:32 Not true! Wind, and Solar are doing it and growing via effeciancy gains and cost parity with gas, oil, & coal. We must only build new fission fast breeder reactors to deal with plutonium waste. Next gen distributed solar+ batteries are creating virtual grids.
3453 2018-04-03 17:13:29 How long is toooo long for you to wait to get your oil changed..?

3456 2018-04-03 17:13:06 This is what happens. Renewables please! Oil spills are not good for our seas or earth.
3457 2018-04-03 17:12:52 Perhaps also a kind of 'identity' politics ie Alberta is all about oil, and therefore we can't let anything get in the way of this identity, and the actions that follow.

3463 2018-04-03 17:12:10 We could definitely use one of them... how does it deal with puddles of oil?
3464 2018-04-03 17:11:58 (Well, at least support the assertion that oil/gas exports are up. I don't know if it supports the assertion that it's part of being tough on Russia; I don't know anywhere near enough about US-Russian diplomatic relations.)
3465 2018-04-03 17:11:57 Well I trust the free market more than the government. Ever heard of carbon capture technologies? Well they were extremely promising but now that we've gutted AB oil and gas industry they have no money to invest in new technologies to reduce their emissions.

3491 2018-04-03 17:09:59 u can't use anointing oil to smash u can use olive oil
3492 2018-04-03 17:09:37 Standard Oil didn't hurt consumers. They were lowering prices below economic cost. Obviously benefitting consumers. They hurt other businesses. Read the Standard Oil case and get back to me when you learn what happened there.
3493 2018-04-03 17:09:28 They not even trying to hide that bad mpg benefits no one but big oil companies aka Trump
3494 2018-04-03 17:09:16 @AudiUK We've been quoted over £220 by @AudiBedford to change the oil in our A3. I'd like to know how you justify charging that much for such a simple job that I've done myself many times in the past.
3495 2018-04-03 17:09:03 Salam Rudolf Rammer,
 
Thanks for connecting. I am active in the Oil & Gas sector and a politician from Libya, I am looking at a possible collaboration as i'm currently interested to invest in your company or any lucrative investment opportunity and business concept.
 
Your …
3496 2018-04-03 17:08:56 what trips me out is that all of this Putin and Trump is ultimately about money. Putin is oil money and trump is media money. How shallow people are.
3497 2018-04-03 17:08:40 Make it the Haitian way w very little water a lol bit of oil and some milk in a pan.

3500 2018-04-03 17:08:14 I once tried to sell The Clumpany to someone. They asked me what they would actually get for their cash. After my three-day silence they decided to invest in snake oil instead.
3501 2018-04-03 17:08:14 Okay
3502 2018-04-03 17:08:09 Weed oil
3503 2018-04-03 17:08:08 bonkers, pollute the air so oil companies can sell more gas to the people choking on the fumes.
3504 2018-04-03 17:08:08 So if you use anointing oil for cooking your food will be blessed and if you apply anointing oil to your body or hair you will be blessed too?please school Me,lol
3505 2018-04-03 17:07:57 Well outside of a 2 yr slump of oil prices because of over drilling the oil patch is/was doing really well, he had nothing to do with it.  He's wrong about the "caravan of illegals" in MX, he's wrong about Amazon, our military is the same as it was before he became whatever he is
3506 2018-04-03 17:07:55 We shouldn't be in the business of nation building.  Unless we're being paid for it.  Oil would be a good payment, sure.
3507 2018-04-03 17:07:44 trying to become Cylindrical by living in an oil drum
3508 2018-04-03 17:07:38 That is a pretty sharp spike starting in 2017 though, isn't it? Obviously "we're now exporting oil and gas" is plainly wrong, but if his supporters were to spin that as "obviously he meant exporting on a large scale", would they be wrong?
3509 2018-04-03 17:07:33 I’m a hard 6 but I’d easily be at least an 8 if I stopped crawling under the cars in the wawa parking lot and drinking the oil that drips out of peoples engines
3510 2018-04-03 17:07:30 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3511 2018-04-03 17:07:24 Me getting an oil change: 
“Ma’am this needs to be changed....and this...and this...do you want us to change it?.” 
Me: “uhhhhh sure?” (I have no idea what these things are)
3512 2018-04-03 17:07:19 and the corporations that produce all that plastic... they have no resposibility?? how about the oil corporations ??  No liability either?
3513 2018-04-03 17:07:18 Thank you for that! Perhaps next year. My TX MIL had an old oil painting of a field of blue bonnets. I loved it. Treasured it. Coveted it. So wanted it. She sold it. 
3514 2018-04-03 17:07:17 And there my wife was wondering why I’ve had a bottle of cooking oil on the side for the past four days...

3524 2018-04-03 17:05:26 The Auto industry cannot sell a vehicle in the state of California unless it meets California's clean air standards they will follow our lead I suggest all states do the same stringent regulations Pruitt is a sell-out to the Auto industry and oil corporations
3525 2018-04-03 17:05:20 I always think that. I make decisions,vote and choose for my kids and potential grandkids and the rest of those in the future. These oil ppl don’t have grandkids? Will they have different air? It’s sad that animals will only be in books. Rainforests will sounds magical
3526 2018-04-03 17:04:45 I keep eating steak and potatoes  that shit oil
3527 2018-04-03 17:04:38 So yours is not full spectrum. The website gives no info on the product either. It is cbd+ in oil.... so they say anyway. You might have a bit of cbg but not full spectrum cannabis oil.
3528 2018-04-03 17:04:35 my skin was literal trash a few years ago and these things got rid of all my acne/scars/red marks and ive been using the most generic cheap ass cleanser and moisturizer

3535 2018-04-03 17:04:01 Capex (oil and gas) is declining for two reasons. In-progress mega-projects are complete, and there are easier/faster ways to make money at these low oil prices than throwing money at an oil sands mega-project.
3536 2018-04-03 17:03:55 I want the oil that will speed up the reaction of my beard growth

3538 2018-04-03 17:03:18 They love to act like their food opinions, including those from other cultures, are absolutely true. I literally HATE reading their yelp reviews when they complain about spice, oil, fat, etc. I love that he told him, yeah white man, you don't know pad thai.

3560 2018-04-03 17:00:44 Trump knows that when Russia finishes their new oil tanker terminal in syria they will dominate European oil industry. He gives Russia the payback for helping him win the election.

3609 2018-04-03 16:54:48 Our huge increase in military spending and oil production are overlooked but really hurt Russia. Russian economy is small and weak and very oil price dependent.
3610 2018-04-03 16:54:47 The auto makers are not totally at fault though.   They, & the US govt, are under the huge thumbs of the oil industry.  

The oil companies have held the US hostage since 2000.  High prices of gas and oil have crippled our economy and imprisoned the auto industry.

3726 2018-04-03 16:41:55 Fear not.  I live in the United States, in the state of Michigan. We have had fracking here for over 50 years without ANY issues.  Just think... If the EU embraced fracking you could all tell Russia no thanks to their government oil and gas.
3727 2018-04-03 16:41:52 You could always mix a red Raspberry seed oil (spf 25) in any kind of lotion. It'll help nourish your skin, is anti-inflammatory, and the oil will not be absorbed (dry out) as quickly as lotion alone.

3731 2018-04-03 16:41:14 PSA: coconut oil isn’t a fool-proof holy grail hair remedy. Depending on your hair, it might actually dry it up. Do a test (try out one hair product for example) before committing to a whole coconut-based hair routine.

3850 2018-04-03 16:27:49 I picked "no", but I could see why some would say "yes". A friend has stomach cancer & uses cannabis oil. She says the problem is the uneven quality of the oil. At least if it's controlled in some way, this would hopefully be sorted out?

3871 2018-04-03 16:26:11 Great that you think that! Can you link me the posts where you’re also fighting oil companies for this since they are the biggest perpetrators?  or is it just women’s healthcare that you’re protesting?

3953 2018-04-03 16:16:43 How u changing the oil,changing a hose,and cleaning the headlights lead to me having a leak in my water pump and needing a new one
3954 2018-04-03 16:16:40 We’re just beating around the bush like you have been doing the last 10 years and you will take it away as fast as you give it!!! Too little too late fix it now! Baby give up one of your many pensions if you can’t find it in your heart to tax oil the fair amount!

3961 2018-04-03 16:16:19 good idea to pop into both tkm4xx and b00ts at differing times cos there's often a third off the facial oil I consistently use (b00ts) and 50% off the same oil if it's in tkm4xx

3980 2018-04-03 16:14:14 Also, if you want to talk about lobbyist groups, you can start with the pharmaceutical companies that have single handidly fueled then opiate crisis.  You can’t start with big oil/gas/coal that lobbies for 45 to get rid of safety nets ensuring they aren’t destroying the planet.
3981 2018-04-03 16:14:06 @NTB you’re service shop in Willow Grove is the slowest I’ve ever been to. Came in for an oil, which I schedule an appointment for, and I’ve been here for over 2 hours. This is just ridiculous. 2 damn hours for an oil change!

3988 2018-04-03 16:13:28 The oil will be transported in the same quantities regardless of whether we have a pipeline. You would prefer it be transported by truck and train? Pipeline is the safest and most eco-friendly way to move oil, if oil must be moved.

4005 2018-04-03 16:11:34 Not "worse"--but certainly more UNCERTAIN/DANGEROUS. We are basically dealing w/leftover Soviet military-industrial complex (Putin/KGB!) and have backed Russia into a corner via expansion of NATO. USA also overreached in Iraq & drove up price of oil, helping Russia "push back."

4014 2018-04-03 16:10:55 This is a BIG story - right up there with @BarackObama locking up the Caribbean oil leases to drive Brazilian oil expansion and @BillClinton locking up federal land leases in the West to help drive Chinese oil and coal exports.
We all remember those blockbuster deceptions.

You have a vague understanding of the law and think more laws will do the things you want that the current laws already cover while you insist that they don't.

The problem isn't a lack of laws, its a lack of resources and LE agency compliance.

4032 2018-04-03 16:08:58 It’s not literally money. Just like oil companies and other businesses, it’s subsidies and breaks. The PO is not a for-profit company. Think tax-exempt, like churches.

4059 2018-04-03 16:05:37 I suppose it is only a coincidence that the only constituency this benefits is the oil industry, that Pruitt happens to be close to.
4060 2018-04-03 16:05:34 Your right ! Alberta gov depends too  heavily on oil money for income .
4061 2018-04-03 16:05:11 With the rainy spring weather approaching, hydroplaning can become a major issue. Rainwater mixing with oil or grime on streets can cause extremely slick roadways. Make sure to drive the speed limit and watch for standing water that can cause hydroplaning.

4064 2018-04-03 16:04:59 I have said this several times, your gaslights are weak. There is no oil in any of your lighters, just Evian-saturated piss water. Not even a hint of ammonia, let alone fuel. On the rare occasion your gaslights burn, that usually means I've stumbled into something important.
4065 2018-04-03 16:04:55 Doesn't mean it is incorrect. Pruitt's ties to oil companies are not secret.

4081 2018-04-03 16:03:44 Excellent!  I 100% support your efforts to hold @EPAScottPruitt accountable for his illegal actions.  He must be removed from his position asap, as his primary objective is to line the pockets of coal and oil barons at the expense of the environment and human health.
4082 2018-04-03 16:03:41 look at all the oil and gas under the north sea. that's the states too. it is not for the crown to give licenses to private companies they themselves hold majority shares in ! send in a labour rig to pay for all the services :)

4084 2018-04-03 16:03:28 I think it’s time to change the name of the @EPA under @realDonaldTrump & @EPAScottPruitt to EDA – Environmental Destruction Agency. Or we could just call it Big Oil. Trump doesn’t care about the environment.  All the agencies under him are a disgrace.
4085 2018-04-03 16:03:20 It's not the car makers behind this, so much as its the oil interests that have always owned crooked lawyer/politician Pruitt.
4086 2018-04-03 16:03:19 And their site is down for maintenance.  Not sure how you need to do maintenance on something that never started.  It's like getting an oil change on a car with no engine.

Hard boil the eggs, remove the shells, fry in oil. Make separate curry with onions, tomatoes, potatoes, etc. Mix the two and cook. Ready.
4089 2018-04-03 16:02:58 Conundrum: 1. Carbon tax increases gas price, but is "ineffective". 2. Oil companies raise prices because of gas "shortages". 1 suggests gasoline demand is price inelastic, 2 suggests it's elastic. Q: so what is price elasticity of gasoline demand in MetroVan? Anyone know?
4090 2018-04-03 16:02:46 Sounds like big oil talking about the expense and difficulty of emerging alt energy sources. Why change/evolve when the current business model is profitable, right?
4091 2018-04-03 16:02:41 Oil of Oregano x3 drops under your tongue for 30 seconds, rinse with water and swallow. Works best at the very beginning of a cold but will also shorten it. Best of luck, hope you feel better.
4092 2018-04-03 16:02:36 Basic Fuel Price on the other hand is largely dependent of international oil prices, shipping cost from major oil trading hubs to Durban and the exchange rate. Government has no direct control on these (R/$ can be influenced by decisions  the government makes on a regular basis)
4093 2018-04-03 16:02:31 This is a brilliant thread, thanks @hannahwaddilove! Amongst my faves are: @whowhywherewhen and @SaeeduH on Nigeria/ normative politics/ elections + @Jonah_Lipton on Sierra Leone/youth/anthro + @GcrCole Eritrea/refugees + @oneoppong on Ghana/political economy/oil
4094 2018-04-03 16:02:25 Try not to burn it or pour two spoons of cooking oil in the water that should help with makhokho not sticking at the bottom of the pot.
4095 2018-04-03 16:02:17 Try throwing them into chicken salad, mix it with some whole wheat pasta, olive oil&tomatoes ( I love throwing artichoke hearts in, too). Or even throwing them on a turkey burger with avocados! For breakfast or a snack you can put some guac in the middle of them on some toast
4096 2018-04-03 16:02:04 You really some Brooklyn nigga nobody want that funky ass coconut oil fur
4097 2018-04-03 16:02:04 try using oils? Use any, mustard oil is good. Put it on like an hour before you wash your hair.
4098 2018-04-03 16:02:01 The head of the EPA is so cozy with oil & gas lobbyists that he uses their condos whenever he comes to town on a taxpayer funded private jet. We can stop the corruption -- at the polls. RT if you're with us! #WTFAgenda

4100 2018-04-03 16:01:56 Knowledge is the maximized of all resources, physical and mental.

Why fight over the finite supplies of oil when expansion of your knowledge could lead to creating a totally new type of infinite fuel?

4125 2018-04-03 15:58:56 none of these hoes know what they’re talking about lmao use tea tree oil, if you have sensitive skin dilute it with water n put it on before you go to sleep n it’ll reduced by at least 50% when you wake up
4126 2018-04-03 15:58:42 What have you tried before ? I don't sleep much and help myself with valerian (essential oil) or magnesium. Sounds like a strong treatment to me what your doctor prescribed.

4134 2018-04-03 15:58:26 However, increased MPG reduces demand for gasoline. Oil companies paid Pruitt in the past and will pay him in his next position. They are the ones really seeking this change.

Industry doesn’t want to come here that has good wages.raise gas tax so working poor Has to pay to go to work. Still has 19th century mentality
4143 2018-04-03 15:56:47 Hahahahaha they just need to get sponsored by Crisco or some motor oil company
4144 2018-04-03 15:56:36 Or goes against the vested interests of their owners as in this case. Better mileage means declining oil sales.

How is Scott Pruitt still head of the EPA. While trump fired some good people.
Pruitt spent $ 43,000 on phone booth in office.
He spent $160,000 in first year on private jets. Rents a condo from a oil Lobbyist this is so obviously abuse.
4160 2018-04-03 15:54:24 It has been living in peace, and if you want to know more read about the golden era. The only reason middle East is in the shit right now is because America plays their dirty politics there for their dirty oil money.

4170 2018-04-03 15:53:15 Shouldn't this headline be in "The Onion" and not a Bloomberg release? The destruction of the environment, destruction of clean air & water, seems to be the only goal of trump's EPA, that & giving huge wealth to an already wealthy oil industry.
4171 2018-04-03 15:53:12 I told Cave to bring me to work so he can take my car to get an oil change and I highly believe he hasn't done so lol
4172 2018-04-03 15:53:11 So because Oil n gas is going to run out we should tax all citizens that for the most part Work in Oil n gas more?  Or maybe allow people to keep more of there income so they can save, invest, & spend which creates more jobs then government ever could. And net positive jobs

4186 2018-04-03 15:52:04 You are wrong ! And you are wrong to allow your henchman Pruitt to rollback better gas mileage requirements. Could this be to help your BFF Putin sell his oil to us? #voteblue2018

4201 2018-04-03 15:51:09 People want cars that get great gas mileage now. Big oil wants to burn more to make max before electric cars take over. People decide what they want not big oil. Dems will reverse the damage Pruitt is doing as soon as they're back in charge.

4222 2018-04-03 15:49:20 Be careful of the coconut oil though- I have hard mashona too & coconut just made it dry & brittle- that kkkrr kkrr sound& don’t get me started on the itchy scalp! . Shea butter & olive oil work better for mine. Glycerin also makes it more manageable.

"Did you know scientists determined that we are all just made out of sawdust and canola oil?"

"What?  I can't find that info anywhere..."

"Just because you can't find it doesn't mean it didn't happen.  But I'm not posting the link, lazy!"

4230 2018-04-03 15:48:53 Canada has one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world. Alberta and other parts of Canada have been pumping oil for decades. Spoiler alert: more oil pipelines does not mean cheaper oil for Canadians.

4232 2018-04-03 15:48:34 Scotland doesn't need an investigation. We know where the oil went, and who stole it. Norway has a £1 trillion oil fund in reserve, Scotland has zilch, nada, nothing, fuck all. Let that be clear 
4233 2018-04-03 15:48:33 new shirt that looks like the ones from zaful and new coconut oil for hair :))
4234 2018-04-03 15:48:28 For the moment, leave oil alone. It is very hard to replace. However, coal can be easily replaced with nuclear power.
So, why not nuclear?

4236 2018-04-03 15:48:20 yeah i like how you can blend the oil really well but sometimes i just blend too much and then it turns into doo doo color. also i like layering shit and since oil takes so fucking long to dry i just avoid it all together bc i don’t have time for that LOL

4238 2018-04-03 15:48:15 He brought his behavior from OK to DC.  Look how little Republicans in OK value teachers, students, everyone, who isn't an oil/gas industry crony.  He's awful.
4239 2018-04-03 15:48:15 The 90s taught me to recycle my stuff, to save whales and seals and energy, and to stop oil wars. Was a weird time to be a kid. Even weirder that these topics vanished since.
4240 2018-04-03 15:48:11 NO MORE GOP BS -they gave OIL AND GAS COMPANIES HUGE TAX BREAKS AND NOW THE STATE IS BANKRUPT!

4245 2018-04-03 15:47:49 Based on what data @EPAScottPruitt ? Did you get it from your oil & gas landlord? Another example of snake oil sales by the Trump administration. #FirePruitt
4246 2018-04-03 15:47:47 What good things would those be? His Tax Scam? Tariffs that are causing trade wars, increased prices in U.S. & stock mkt drops? His war against the environment? Stealing public lands for Oil companies? The only 'good' thing I've seen was him declaring World Autism Awareness Day.
4247 2018-04-03 15:47:45 A country independent of oil and with clean air is a leader and everyone wins including future generations. No planet, no offspring and no clean air is tragic. Let's go forward not backwards. #epa #tessla #hybrids #ford #Chevrolet #Toyota #nissan #Honda #BMW #Kia
4248 2018-04-03 15:47:38 Pruitt learned to ignore the law and flout government ethics from the oil and gas folks in Oklahoma. He took letters from oil and gas and slapped his AG letterhead on it. He used private email for state business. With Trump, he's a kid in a candy store. #FirePruitt

4256 2018-04-03 15:46:41 American auto manufacturers and the oil refiners that want to sell more gas now that they know how to get oil out of the shell rock

4259 2018-04-03 15:46:25 @SinclairOilCorp is a great company in the oil and gas industry. They support the many communities and kids in my state and employ thousands. This is to no thanks to the democrats or Obama. But it’s okay for Silicon Valley to trash @realDonaldTrump
4260 2018-04-03 15:46:24 With Oklahoma's extensive oil & gas wealth, there is absolutely no excuse for the state's teachers & students to have been so short-changed for so many years. It's a massive 3rd world-type failure that unfortunately exists in too many states!
4261 2018-04-03 15:46:17 Anyone who will line his pockets with money.  NRA, lobbyists, oil, gas.  But no the people of #Nevada
4262 2018-04-03 15:46:13 Trump's OK with it because he and his buddies are making $$ from Pruitt's relentless moves to dismantle all environmental regulations against Big Oil and Gas. Trump's entire regime is a classic kleptocracy.
4263 2018-04-03 15:46:13 Disappointed in @EPA decision to roll back #CleanerCars standards and force Delawareans to spend more money on gas, increase oil consumption, and damage our air quality - endangering our health. We deserve better.
4264 2018-04-03 15:46:13 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

4266 2018-04-03 15:45:55 and replacing it with oil alternatives is not an option as it would require more land. We must push the industry onto a sustainable path as a matter of urgency.

4267 2018-04-03 15:45:52 Ignorance is no excuse for sure. Can you tell me why all the Big Oil companies have bailed on the tar sands? Why WCS sells for $35? Answer: no one really wants such a dirty heavy crude.

Lougheed saw the tar sands as a highly subsidized moonscape that provides no benefits to AB.
4268 2018-04-03 15:45:50 Hello @theponsfords. Our certification standard protects primary forest from being cleared.

4269 2018-04-03 15:45:47 The answer to @83littlemj's question "Does the Oil, Gas and Coal industry get to pick who is in charge of the Dept of Energy?" is "Yes, literally." As for the first question: obviously not or AMVETS wouldn't have had to send the letter.

4272 2018-04-03 15:45:26 Dermalogica I think? @ Ulta. They have Lil packs so you get mini products for cheaper but still can do the whole routine. And ya can get it for whatever ur prollem is. That and bio oil. Can get it CVS. I put that on mostly every night. Helps my face to not produce as much oil.
4273 2018-04-03 15:45:07 obviously the gas pump guy is on better money or the other guy wouldn't have to hustle.  but it's a stupid dynamic.  the onus should be on Big Oil to pay these guys properly.

4296 2018-04-03 15:42:23 I'm not strawman-ing anything about your oil argument. I am just pointing out that when providing context, there are many other factors which you are omitting for some reason (ignorance, laziness, agenda, bias or whatever)

It's true! - the best way forward is for more citizen-owned energy to be encouraged/subsidized. Like solar and geothermal for homes and co-ops etc.

It can build our country, we should plant  trees to escape the side effects
4336 2018-04-03 15:39:43 No because the plutocracy believes in war and a true leftist is anti war and pro peace. A true leftists is anti fracking, anti oil and gas, anti privatized prisons, anti GMOs, which are all a part of the plutocracy.

4341 2018-04-03 15:39:12 Quite so.

Fascism is the merger of state and corporate power.

Putin, Russian oligarchs and the Russian mafia are the holy trinity of their fascist state, which diverts billions in public funds from state oil, gas and mining companies into the select hands of a few people.

They went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.

4365 2018-04-03 15:35:55 dude i respect that, i cannot paint with oil to save my life it’s so fuckin messy it frustrates the hell out of me. same with watercolor, like i’m super anal and ocd about my art so when i’m using a medium that’s hard to control i freak out lol

4370 2018-04-03 15:35:25 BEAUTY MEME: CASTOR OIL IN MILITARY: I want to endorse Major Halberstadt in regard to castor oil. You might eliminate a very large part of everything else if you have a large quantity of castor oil.

4373 2018-04-03 15:35:18 Lougheed's publicly-funded (subsidized) Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority developed In-situ tech so corporations didn’t have to spend all that $$$money$$$ developing it.

4375 2018-04-03 15:35:10 It doesn't help that the price of gas in the US has remained low due to the increase in domestic oil production. I wonder how US demand for more fuel efficient vehicles would be if consumers were paying $4.57US/gal for gas like we do in Vancouver?
4376 2018-04-03 15:35:08 The pirates in Somalia are 18 year olds and can board a whole oil tanker. All that they have is courage and AK 47. Are those the weapons your u call sophisticated?? There are courages men who can be identified and trained and equipped to protect the coast line.

4389 2018-04-03 15:33:58 I've advocated $10./gal. for oil & gasoline for 10 years; it would prod conservation, make alt. energy attractive, force folks to use no more than their fair share.

4398 2018-04-03 15:33:29 It shouldn't be up to him! He does not represent anything but the oil industry. While Oklahoma AG he filed many frivolous lawsuits favoring big oil, including a lawsuit against Colorado when they legalized marijuana because he thought it would hurt the oil industry!

Why don't they, out of their public responsibility, provide the educational monies needed? OK state govt need to tax this oil giant instead of letting teachers & the children be left behind.

4414 2018-04-03 15:31:13 With the exception that higher prices due to higher oil prices, money only flowed back to oil companies. Whereas in a properly managed CT system, the money flows into better alternatives for consumers through incentives and research.

4419 2018-04-03 15:30:32 If Pruitt uses AirBnb, do the owners post complaints, “left sheets covered with coal dust.”?
“Bathtub was ringed with crude oil.”
4420 2018-04-03 15:30:32 I think the difference is that OK teachers and state employees have not had a pay increase for 10 years...state spending per student dropped to 49th in the US while taxes on oil production was dropped 70% most oil cos paying no income tax for 15 years

4435 2018-04-03 15:28:39 He means oil industry first!!
4436 2018-04-03 15:28:36 His family are millionaires. This guy's  father made bank off his wife's suicide when his kids were young. Selling snake oil, no less. Parading 10 year old David and his siblings around to peddle the same crap. Instead of getting them grief counselling.
The guy is screwed up.
4437 2018-04-03 15:28:33 Our house is wicked old and the realtor believed in ghosts. I wrote a list of what we wanted in our negotiations to buy and wrote "no ghosts" after the thing about the oil heat and he crossed it out and gently passed the paper back to me.

4439 2018-04-03 15:27:55 $119 for an oil change. The non-profit I do web work for can't pay my bill on time because of grant cutbacks. #America! #SoMuchWinning
4440 2018-04-03 15:27:55 Because the public loves giving money to oil companies, obviously.

4445 2018-04-03 15:27:23 Put one in an oil slick, one in lead contaminated water, and the rest in front of a firing squad with assault rifles.
4446 2018-04-03 15:27:22 Yes it’s a possibility that frightens me for sure. The tropical rainforests in borneo and sumatra are very important for this country but unfortunately the corruption, palm oil companies coupled with ignorance from the general public has led to this.

4463 2018-04-03 15:24:36 The best beard routine is what works for you. Wash with all natural or essential oil infused soap as often as you like. Comb and brush as often as you like. I suggest oil for your beard and every other part of your body. Be healthy and close to your God.

4467 2018-04-03 15:24:00 If your last oil change was before winter, then it's time to do that and flush your transmission fluid. It's costly and therefore often neglected but it costs even more toe rebuild or replace your transmission.
4468 2018-04-03 15:23:55 Apparently #ScottPruitt doesn't understand that he's dupposed to PROTECT the Environment.  Of course, what can you expect from an oil man!
4469 2018-04-03 15:23:53 We don't need to extract every drop of oil and gas from the Earth, and ESPECIALLY not preserved public lands!
4470 2018-04-03 15:23:52 The people in the audience clapping were big oil executives

4478 2018-04-03 15:22:57 not as scary as it sounds, wear your hair up everyday and don’t wash it until it’s all cleared up. If you get it don’t use the chemical shampoos just soak your hair in coconut oil in a bag over night!
4479 2018-04-03 15:22:54 debating getting a coffee after my oil change but like is a thin mint or samoa flavored coffee really worth the possibility of having a panic attack? lol
4480 2018-04-03 15:22:51 This is absolutely disgraceful for Oklahoma! The state continues to have great oil & gas wealth that could be much better used to develop & diversify the state's economy. Instead, this wealth has mainly further enriched  the wealthy, like in 3rd world countries!
4481 2018-04-03 15:22:48 Oh. I didn’t know what it was so I looked it up and found a Russian oil company. What platform do you use to purchase?
4482 2018-04-03 15:22:37 Your brain is leaking oil egbon 
4483 2018-04-03 15:22:30 It's all about the oil. The west is afraid to speak their mind cause KSA would retaliate.

4485 2018-04-03 15:22:16 Cute idea  and so cool for the guests too. I would have just gotten a bunch of Fosters oil cans and called it a day. 
4486 2018-04-03 15:22:16 Also very damaging to the US economy. No more car exports. A lot of oil wasted. And more health problems.

4492 2018-04-03 15:21:19 True, but from a macro perspective, and compared to past growth, the oil rigs have leveled off.  Micro, obviously could be gains and losses, based upon specific plays.  
This represents a macro trend change.

B) you obviously didn't read, where I said we absolutely help that person, just not in the totally wrong way you suggest that will literally pollute the world.

You aren't fighting for the single mom, but billionaire oil execs.
4499 2018-04-03 15:20:45 In Oklahoma, the only state that every county voted red have the 49th lowest wage in the country. Most leave to teach in Texas. Do they not deserve to make a good living? Oil companies in OK pay very little tax btw.

4510 2018-04-03 15:19:42 As much money as people who operate oil fields make the tax increase isn't a lot. Teachers make a lot less money then lots of people working in the oil fields. #dacccoll

4513 2018-04-03 15:19:29 Finally splurged on a good lip primer to enable my  habit. And the lip exfoliator recipe (coconut oil, brown sugar, honey) from @QueerEye is everything.

Also I tested some liquid eyeliners on my hand for funsies and the @LiseWatier 24-hours glam one does not mess around.

4516 2018-04-03 15:19:02 We’ve been a net exporter of oil for almost ten years! Ok. I’ve got to shut this down. I’ll either be laughing myself silly or getting angry at the lies you’ve swallowed. Taking you out of my stream now. My best to your wife! God bless!

4523 2018-04-03 15:18:13 If you can't breathe, you can't buy a car. The oil industry is on a decline and refuses to accept the fact. In a few decades, there will be no gasoline-driven cars. This is their last gasp. Just hope it's not ours!

4526 2018-04-03 15:17:35 He’s referring to carbon tax and an invent a tax government as oil and gas is 20+ year investment unlike the churn and burn cycle of gov we have. The whole burn it to the ground infrastructure thinking needs to go. Investments should be made to last and more Canadians consulted.

4535 2018-04-03 15:16:38 That's what they are telling. But that's not what the price changes go by. Hubs is in the gas&oil business. When oil goes up so does gas. The last couple of weeks oil has risen in price. But they won't tell you that on the news. They say stuff like oh Spring break. Vacations.

4546 2018-04-03 15:15:19 ProTip: Get regular oil changes at least every 5k. And if you switch to full synthetic, never change back. More money, but worth it. Also, never leave home without an Atlas, the paper kind.
4547 2018-04-03 15:15:17 I heard the only reason they are turning all Mr Nice Guy is because their oil is drying up. Soon all they will have is a giant kitty litter box of a country. Is this true?

4556 2018-04-03 15:14:15 From the IARC-Report: 
Cancer could  be caused by lipid peroxidation products from PUFAs in the meat
Probably.
Or was it the vegetable oil in the pan used for frying?
Good: shows lipid peroxidation products are dangerous
Bad: vegetable oils as the main source are not mentioned
4557 2018-04-03 15:14:03 And "some" free market conservatives. The ones concerned with an oil company bottom line, not the future, not sustainability or factish type thingy's. The regroup and regress party... The futures only hope is they're all old (and bald...?)

4561 2018-04-03 15:13:42 Change happens slowly. See the civil rights movement and what they had to go through in order to affect change. 

Eco-terrorism has not been effective at stopping oil companies either. As Carris said, it just gives the oil companies something to discredit the green movement.
4562 2018-04-03 15:13:39 And ask this to obama :) tell me how people walk safely in Iraq? Oh yeah what happened the nuclear weapons there? Never found? Or you just found oil? Tell me why are you still in Iraq? Your government has been terrorising the area for a long while. +only Turkey has 3m refugees.

Wait until Trump finds out the Chinese intends to sell oil worldwide in their own currency per barrel, and not in $ per barrel as it is at present. Ban on fortune cookie imports?

4574 2018-04-03 15:12:14 No other product is sold in the Lower Mainland that raises its price arbitrarily 8-10 cents for morning rush/long weekend etc. And the disparity between crude oil and refined product has jumped 200% in the last ten years. Oh right, “price cycling”. You clearly work for big oil.

4637 2018-04-03 15:05:38 How about reporting news without Trump, i.e the tropical cyclone Josie that hit Fiji causing floods or information on the French rail strike, it's been on going for three months. Or how about the Saudi oil tanker hit in Houthi attack off Yemen. Just a sample of real nonTrump news

4655 2018-04-03 15:03:23 Besides, as an engineer, you should know we're farther along than reported.

Roughly...
88% of oil used in rail just moves coal.
100% of refined oil energy is required in electricity to refine it.
To replace 100% of FF electricity only requires 30 to 33% on site renewables.
Etc.

4706 2018-04-03 14:58:23 IMHO @EPAScottPruitt Who is suggesting to you to roll back the emission standards? Oil companies, Koch Bros, who?? My fellow Americans and I want clean air!
4707 2018-04-03 14:58:06 Alberta’s main oil customer USA who buy it at 30’/,discount then sell gas back to BC. They export Tanker oil just south of Burnaby. Alaska sails Oil Tankers daily right past Vancouver to US refineries. Canada looses Billions, could give Daycare, Drug Plan, Senior Care, Surgeries.
4708 2018-04-03 14:58:06 Olive oil is cold pressed. The olives are ground into a paste and then pressed to extract the oil. This contrasts with other oils, like sunflower and canola, that are extracted with chemical solvents, generally hexane.
4709 2018-04-03 14:58:03 Gold and diamonds? Oil we freely gave them back and they didn’t know they had, we spent a fortune finding and setting up the extraction infrastructure for it and therefore deserved recompense.

4720 2018-04-03 14:57:03 @dpradhanbjp @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia @PetroleumMin Maximum 28% tax can be collected from  fuel under GST , which is 48% at the moment. How can the govt loose so much of common man money. Oil ministry & finance ministry are very much aware of the issue...
4721 2018-04-03 14:57:02 Except if we look at 2005-2007 timeframe, oil and gas prices were very high, yet emissions didn't fall.  Consumers didn't reduce consumption in a major way.  So a tax equivalent to those prices wouldn't even be enough to move the needle.
4722 2018-04-03 14:56:50 You’ve been exploited by the oil industry your entire life.
4723 2018-04-03 14:56:36 Remember tho... they cook all of their food with canolla oil. Not good....
4724 2018-04-03 14:56:35 Alberta has done the heavy lifting for years with the

I am fortunate to live out West and away from the unrealistic 
thinking of Ontario and Quebec.
4725 2018-04-03 14:56:26 Saudi coalition says Yemeni rebels attack Saudi oil tanker -
4726 2018-04-03 14:56:04 The government claims its socialist. And if I Google for 5 minutes I find that the government nationalized the oil industry in 1976. And that oil accounts for more than 50% of GDP, and 95% of exports. But whatever I guess you know better.

4736 2018-04-03 14:55:15 Just take you a clove, peel, lightly cover in olive oil, add a dash or salt and pepper and bake / roast that fucker for about 10-15 minutes (oven depending) and then eat it that way. You lose some nutrients but just add an extra bit to your intake. Makes it easier to eat.
4737 2018-04-03 14:55:15 @JohnnyMagic1067 yes, try bulletproof coffee! It’s not just grass fed butter, you also should add MCT oil/Coconut oil. Helps you focus better and keeps you full longer! It’s delicious!!

4843 2018-04-03 14:44:28 THC infused tincture.  U use vegetable glycerin (a naturally sweet tasting byproduct of palm oil).

4859 2018-04-03 14:43:19 Are you seriously suggesting that because the oil companies supposedly want a carbon tax before 2015, that negates Ms. McKenna’s need to show Canadians how her plan is going reduce emissions? With respect, your point is nonsensical. But I’m not a morning person so maybe it’s me.

4921 2018-04-03 14:37:33 相対性理論って、ロマンチックだねとか言った奴誰だよ辛い時間引き伸ばされて休みだけ縮められてんじゃねえか
4922 2018-04-03 14:37:30 ^Exactly. If we taxed corporations the same way we already tax actual Oklahomans, we would have enough money to fix ALL of the budget shortfalls, & even have some left over to start to get some things done around here!

Oil & Gas currently only pay 2.5% taxes!!!!

4924 2018-04-03 14:37:07 You won't see this in my #OPEC stories unless editors insert it later. Wherever I've worked I've argued against "cartel" because 1) OPEC pumps about a third of the world's oil and doesn't hold a monopoly position 2) it's a term with negative connotation so its use isn't impartial

4946 2018-04-03 14:35:13 Coconut Oil has so many amazing properties which is why we decided to use it as the base oil in our VULSINI SKIN Massage Oil Collection! 
4947 2018-04-03 14:35:08 So much dbl trpl down long side perhaps only a washing out will be lo e reversal of consensus. Fwiw commercial is not imbalanced on oil trade, its the non industry gamblers in the long drivers seat.
4948 2018-04-03 14:35:02 visits in early 80s and '97, no difference... Thick darkness when night falls. People drink from the rivers...just a matter of separating the dirt and scooping with bowl.... That's the story of an oil producing state in Ondo state
4949 2018-04-03 14:35:01 there is whabism like we say maliki or shafi3i etc...it became its own fiqh school ... it toke the islamic world by storm through the their oil money and the satisfaction of their masters the Americans and Zionists...not only Shia have problem with it we the Sunna too...
4950 2018-04-03 14:34:53 BS. Your are in the pockets of the oil companies.  Who overseas will want to buy our high emissions cars.?

4953 2018-04-03 14:34:34 DJT has exacerbated the pressure on Russia economically by increasing our oil exports.

Watch Putin on YouTube at his town hall meetings with his country's women putting him on the spot.

Unlike here, Putin answers the questions directly, truthfully and admits mistakes.

4957 2018-04-03 14:34:05 This is a test site for the UK, once our methods are proven safe (they are vastly superior to US methods) then the rollout can begin throught England and Wales. There both oil and gas to be recovered.
4958 2018-04-03 14:34:01 From taxes. Oklahoma needs to increase taxes. They slashed and cut and promised it would be better. They lied and OK's children suffer for their lies. OK has literally yielded the stability of the earth to the oil industry. TAX THEM.

4967 2018-04-03 14:32:55 Time to spread fake fact fear regarding the dangers of using oil..
Poisoning fish, cancer, radioactive clouds.     Anything to put the fear of the almighty into the public who think oil, gas is ok.
4968 2018-04-03 14:32:47 Does anyone know how to lock in moisture for loc’d hair? My hair is so dry and when I put oil in my hair it only lasts a day

4974 2018-04-03 14:31:59 For my whole life a Russia/US alliance is key to balance against China, still valid.

Like him or not Putin has done the best job for his country the past 2 decades with the worst hand to play. Plus, the price of oil fell significantly which really hurts Russia.

4997 2018-04-03 14:29:48 OK has one of the lowest corporate tax rates/highest corporate tax exemptions in the entire country. Gov. Fallin declared a “Christian Day of Prayer for Our Oil Fields.” Most OK funding goes to oil & gas corps or has been embezzled (OK Dept of Health).

END CORRUPTION = FUNDING
4998 2018-04-03 14:29:43 Let me shed a bit of light on the term “Spirituality” as used in the context. It means Rebellion just as Religiousness means orthodoxy. Spirituality is individuality while religious fanaticism work with being part of the crowd psychology. Suffice to say he is no Sheep but a Lion.

5000 2018-04-03 14:29:14 Imported products & imported raw material would make a larger contribution in fuelling inflation figures. Prices of local products would also go up from suppliers to the markets. Oil will become expensive, adding to the pressure already being witnessed in fuel prices #lka
5001 2018-04-03 14:29:06 We ran out of heating oil so for the last two months of our lease we tryna just wear a lot of clothes and hope for nice weather

5006 2018-04-03 14:28:38 How can increasing rev by increasing the gross production tax on oil and gas closer to 7% not help. A $5 hotel tax is peanuts in the world of hotels. I don’t think about the $12-$18 tax when I go to other cities. I haven’t had a COLA in 10 years as a retired prin. It’s our money
5007 2018-04-03 14:28:30 2 85s and 2 double neck oil please

5010 2018-04-03 14:27:59 The activations will surely give you some kind of segmentation. I doubt that it is analog to the process of oil painting, but it would probably help the algorithm to make more informed decisions about things like background/foreground.
5011 2018-04-03 14:27:59 I like to give mine a soak in scented essence oil before fitting a new one.

5019 2018-04-03 14:26:51 While global Crude Oil prices has generally been going up in the last little while, It has actually only dropped in the last 1 week. 
This increase in India is somehow, unrelated. Unless, it is based on import stocks and inventory.

5021 2018-04-03 14:26:30 Not anymore. That’s why there are nuclear, gas, oil etc power generators. If we could go 100% renewables, cost effective, then we would (hopefully) but we can’t rely on renewables for 100% yet. Hopefully in the next 20 years technology is available to be able to do so though

Plus, Trump has us a net exporter of oil.

Should have happened years ago. No way you can take that accomplishment away from him.

The money Obama, McConnell, McCain, the Clintons stole making this mess, CRIMINAL.

It will all come out.

5075 2018-04-03 14:20:28 Oh I am a huge metric fan, but this is a case of the numbers being different every place I found the recipe; differences between 4 eggs and 5, 100 g of veg oil and 150, etc. So many people think it's their fault when a recipe fails, but I think that's not always true.
5076 2018-04-03 14:20:20 I tried coconut oil once on my hair. It was a greasy disaster. Now I just use it as a skin moisturiser xx

5090 2018-04-03 14:19:10 America is selling off its national monuments to coal and oil interests, dropping funding for education and rules against predatory lending and collections for college students while tuitions skyrocket. Pay attention at home! We are SICK to death of your BS!

5092 2018-04-03 14:19:07 I’ve seen it at Target a few times and I’ve picked it up to read it but never committed. I will give it a try!! I wash my face with a very light cleanser, I moisturize, use Tarte Maracuja oil and I’ve tried 100 different “hydrating masks”. It’s frustrating  My skin sucks
5093 2018-04-03 14:19:07 Well, we can agree to disagree. 

A career in oil (since the late 70's, still going) after public accounting. Carter made a mess of Iran. The Bushes made a mess of Iraq. Hillary and Barrack couldn't have messed up the ME more if they tried 100 different times.

DT/Putin will win.

5100 2018-04-03 14:18:15 Ma'am, you are resounding my point . Saying crude oil is the root cause is naive at best. 
Crude oil does not tap itself, it does not refine itself, it does not export itself...it's the people/institutions in charge that mess things up for us all.

5139 2018-04-03 14:14:02 $70/bbl is demand unsustainable but suits the US (who have manipulated Brent whenever they could since at least 2005). Capital intensive oil/gas-as-commodity market paradigm will give way to capital lite energy-as-service market

5214 2018-04-03 14:05:03 Saudi Arabia is a theocratic dictatorship. Iran has a history of elections and progressivism, until the USA decided they wanted a puppet installed so they got a better deal for oil. Now they have sham elections and are run by the hardcore Shias, but the young are resisting.

5227 2018-04-03 14:03:49 What I do understand is preventing mass genocide. Seems reasonable. What I can’t understand is invading for recourses like oil etc. and I don’t think every war situation where we’re supposedly invading for “innocents” will be better off for our invasion. Often makes it worse.

5229 2018-04-03 14:03:47 @EPAScottPruitt the rest of the world wants to lower greenhouse gas emissions and by allowing auto manufactures to change these standards they will only be less competitive globally. Why go backwards? Oh yeah because you are literally in bed with the oil industry.

Natural gas is still being flared during oil extraction - instead of being stored for other uses.

5267 2018-04-03 14:00:41 The uk population is been drown by uk government propaganda boosted by the likes of eejit johnson, all of this is due to russia selling its oil in chinese yuan rather than us dollar. When saddam tried to sell his oil in euros we had similar lies.

5278 2018-04-03 13:58:59 $45 crude is supply unsustainable. Any nation that requires imported oil, in order to fuel its economy, would be stupid to corrupt future supply, in return for short-term price relief.

The tragedy of Venezuela is that its citizens and leaders are addicted to oil, which causes national deliriums of non- existent wealth and power, and leads to (distain) for healthy institutions, discipline, and planning.

5345 2018-04-03 13:51:05 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
5346 2018-04-03 13:51:00 appears downtick in market related to attack on SA oil tanker. $SPY
5347 2018-04-03 13:50:57 It'll take more than that. Stopping Alberta oil altogether and the loss of BC jobs as a result might though.
5348 2018-04-03 13:50:34 Other considerations:
-Ad money is finite, as more companies crowd into online, there's less $ to go around, even without considering GOOG + FB vacuuming up the pie

-As someone in data, I was under the impression that targeted ads have been somewhat of a snake oil
5349 2018-04-03 13:50:33 Alaskans own 53,929 shares of SECURE ENERGY SERVICES INC, worth $396,284. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.

5351 2018-04-03 13:50:14 Sco has paid it's way over the last 300 yrs.  I'm just talking about here and now and the numbers speak for themselves .  People have short term memories and saying that the oil revenues will get back to 2010-13 levels is not enough.  The figures worked in 2014 - they don't now.

Three interesting things about me.
 I've played the pianon for almost eleven years. 
 I was trained to draw realism in charcoal for two years and oil painting for one year, but I draw in pencils now and I love them. 
I am addicted to Midsomer Murders
5365 2018-04-03 13:48:40 Subsidized jobs a liberal create work project. Energy production is not a jobs program. The fact it takes more people to provide for 1% of our energy consumption than it takes to provide for 52% (67% if imported oil is included) is not a positive aspect of clean tech.

5386 2018-04-03 13:46:38 Smart thinking, but I can tell you that Muslims love everyone . Why can’t you think when Christians hunt other Christians in schools , movie theaters, churches , concerts and everywhere else . Besides what Christian troops do overseas of killing Muslim children for oil.

5399 2018-04-03 13:44:16 Pro tip: put dry shampoo in your hair before going to bed so when you wake up all the oil had already been absorbed
5400 2018-04-03 13:44:14 Of course the GAN just simulates the textures, lighting and color-spaces of oil paintings. If you wanted to turn it into an actual painting you would need to train another model that tries to separate the pixels into layered strokes. AFAIK people are experimenting in that area.

5402 2018-04-03 13:44:06 We can't affirmatively say that, but of a truth crude oil as done us more harm than good.....taking a queue from the advent of 1977 wen our den president said we ave so much and don't know what to do with it. The oil boom was d beginning of our many woes
5403 2018-04-03 13:44:02 We haven’t had a raise in 10 years! They took 150 million off the top after they signed the bill!  Also, they only signed the bill after a threat of a walkout was relayed. The Oil and Gas Company doesn’t pay the taxes they should!  Check the # of lobbyists

5409 2018-04-03 13:42:56 It all comes down to the plethora of oil grades in the global market; and the refineries that are picky about which grades they can process into products. US shale oil has far different characteristics than the oil that is coming in from Venezuela, for example.

5416 2018-04-03 13:41:51 Shouldn't be, but yes. Right just wants more coal and oil (unsustainable), left wants 100% renewable (unachievable). Centrists follow evidence, not dogma
5417 2018-04-03 13:41:49 Naah.  Crude oil is NOT the root cause. Norway got oil. UAE got oil.

Bad governance structures and Corrupt/Inept/Avarice-filled/Zero-visionary/Ignorant rulers and docile/compromised citizens are the root causes of our trials & tribulations.

5432 2018-04-03 13:39:57 Crude oil is why Nigeria is lagging behind. Crude oil is why our leaders have refused to devote the efforts and time to effectively and efficiently manage our human resources. 
But ofc it would be gullible to think crude alone is the root cause of all Nigeria's problems. Right?

5434 2018-04-03 13:39:43 @GovMaryFallin This is absolutely disgraceful for Oklahoma! The state continues to have great oil & gas wealth that could be much better used to develop & diversify the state's economy. Instead, this wealth has mainly further enriched  the wealthy, like in 3rd world countries!
5435 2018-04-03 13:39:42 On a positive note big oil will make him an okie senator. We should all be so lucky. #deepstate
5436 2018-04-03 13:39:38 Let our countrymen(women) know that Saudi Arabia is NOT a ROLE MODEL for Muslims & Pakistan. It might be for state & some institutions who squeeze Riyals/oil from them. Saudi Arabia is the most prejudiced and arrogant nation on the planet.If they are d**** rich..who cares?
5437 2018-04-03 13:39:34 Guess you missed this Pew funded over 50 groups including First Nations to oppose oil in Canada. Do you have an example of this type of funding to oppose oil in the USA ?

5477 2018-04-03 13:34:14 Mr Painter the writing is on the wall. Of COURSE staying with Lobbyists in OIL & other environmental destructive minds have Pruitt there to discuss dropping REGS & maybe making $ off the market at the same time. It's so obvious!
5478 2018-04-03 13:34:10 Thanks to the doctors for the best birthday present with the old "There's an issue with your blood, get your ass back here! Also your lungs are still getting an oil change so they don't work great yet!!" Making a joke of it in an effort to smile x
5479 2018-04-03 13:34:09 I use valor essential oil and it is so helpful!

5483 2018-04-03 13:34:01 You were all for state's rights when you were AG in OK. Does that mean you're only for state's rights when it's for YOUR benefit (we know you're paid off by the oil/gas industry).
5484 2018-04-03 13:33:55 Take car in for an oil change. They call: here is $600 of repairs you need. Every freaking time. All I want Trailbreaker to do is reach the finish line of this PhD. Come on.
5485 2018-04-03 13:33:38 Last thing I need is an oil leak on car
5486 2018-04-03 13:33:33 My visits in early 80s and '97, no difference... Thick darkness when night falls. People drink from the rivers...just a matter of separating the dirt and scooping with bowl.... That's the story of an oil producing state in Ondo state

5493 2018-04-03 13:32:46 Urethane does not fare well outdoors. But, I wonder how an oil finish would do, like Tung or Linseed?
5494 2018-04-03 13:32:40 We also think that the state law is ripe for abuse by vengeful ex's.
5495 2018-04-03 13:32:33 There are many places I could go to get an oil change that might be closer to where I live but because of the customer service and how I am treated, I’ve stayed loyal to the same place. Customer service goes a long way. #mavorg

5529 2018-04-03 13:28:15 Let’s be honest about this.  Trump has no idea we have strategic oil reserves.   Who are the people in his administration is pushing all of these changes?

5533 2018-04-03 13:26:59 Add into that mix the oil and gas industry - Corbyn has pledged to ban fracking and is pro-renewables. O and G gets subsidies and tax breaks while subsidies for renewables have been slashed. Why is the government pushing the fracking agenda when it's not financially viable ?
5534 2018-04-03 13:26:49 Highlight #2749573 of moving to paducah is that I don’t have to get an oil change once a month anymore 
5535 2018-04-03 13:26:46 @GovAbbott This is disgraceful for Oklahoma! The state continues to have great oil & gas wealth that could be much better used to develop & diversify the state's economy. Instead, this wealth has mainly further enriched  the wealthy, like 3rd world countries! TX should take note.
5536 2018-04-03 13:26:40 mmmm... HE anointeth my head with OIL in the presence of mine enemies. Thank You Lord.
5537 2018-04-03 13:26:36 Nothing new here. This was attempted in California during the 80's under Governor Moonbeam. Hundreds of millions of dollars were invested and new technologies developed. When oil prices dropped CA legislators and courts pulled the contractual rug out from under the investors.

5544 2018-04-03 13:26:10 If you can't trust an oil company, who can you trust? CCS cost money, and the amount of CO2 to be sequestered is ginormous. The only current practical use is in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Go figure.
5545 2018-04-03 13:26:06 Getting an oil change in Motorcity and these guys can't figure out how to change oil for a Fiat.

5549 2018-04-03 13:25:44 Nuclear power for electricity, electric vehicles, and heat pumps or nuclear power for district heating are not so gut-wrenching and would hardly be noticed by the general population. The oil companies could start drilling for water instead of oil and gas.

5561 2018-04-03 13:24:32 Bear in mind too, 80s saw reliance on coal decline, as nuclear and oil emerged. outdated mines that were non productive/profitable were being subsidised by state, excessive wage demands and refusal to compromise (scargil) saw not Maggie, but miners themselves, ruin their industry
5562 2018-04-03 13:24:29 Of CBD oil or hemp oil?

5566 2018-04-03 13:23:51 Bibi has only to look at America to see CLEAR indicators that "OIL and WATER don't mix"; that granting UNLIMITED PRIVILEGES/ENTITLEMENTS/FREEBIES/PERKS can neither CONVERT nor ENLIGHTEN those w/a decidedly embittered/chronically dissatisfied mindset. "Who needs it?", says Bibi.

5579 2018-04-03 13:21:57 I guess if Scotland had 20 billion quid this year like the Norwegians managed on less oil then the growth figures would look different and a budget 40% bigger would be justified?

5598 2018-04-03 13:19:53 The price of gas normally goes up during this time of year.

5623 2018-04-03 13:17:14 We've obviously reached the point where mass media doesn't report anymore, it's the oil on the fire of this increasingly nocive tribalism. And sadly, I think as a society we did it to ourselves. journalistic integrity doesn't mean anything in a click driven market
5624 2018-04-03 13:17:12 Farm fresh Unsweetened yogurt with seedless grapes is lovely for refreshments btw, sweet potatoes and sauce with a lot of veggies (carrots ,sweet corn, green pepper etc)no vegetable oil, unsalted butter or olive oil is cool.
5625 2018-04-03 13:17:02 Look at it as a new technology. Look at the new smart grid as a new item to sell. Once you see that. You can see the potential for a new Standard Oil Co. The smart grid can be sold nation wide much like the invention of the oil pipeline. Big oil would eat that up. & it's green.
5626 2018-04-03 13:16:58 You can drink prune juice or mineral oil and I think water and Epsom salt and it’ll clean you right out. You can lose pounds that way if you still wanna eat lol

5695 2018-04-03 13:08:18 you can answer most of those (not sure about alien invasions). Fact is Sco currently benefits from a preferential funding position within the UK and shouting "OIL, savings on stuff we don't want/benefit from,Trident, HS2, Debt repayments, etc etc" ain't going to win the argument.

5770 2018-04-03 12:57:50 The media is not about the truth. It's about showing what they can get the populis to believe. Vietnam media war, dessert storm media war for oil, oif, oef media war for oil. Modern media displays half truths

5783 2018-04-03 12:55:55 The whole idea of conflict with Russia is being manufactured by executives of the military contractors, bankers and oil companies. They control the press, State Department and the CIA. Behind the scenes, Trump is working with Putin and Xi to bring them under control.

5788 2018-04-03 12:55:30 Trump is clearly just out to get Amazon/Bezos. He heard something somewhere that he can use to hurt them financially & perhaps with his base. I truly believe he could not care less about USPS rates given that he would gladly sell off fed land for oil/gas exploration for nothing.
5789 2018-04-03 12:55:20 Hahaha. Medium to high heat, dropped the egg in the pan without preheating it much, took it out when the edges got that brown crusty type. Oil wasn't alot, enough to cover the egg.

5803 2018-04-03 12:53:50 This tweet is proof that FoS is a front for the oil industry (we already knew that), not a non-partisan organization that promotes science. FoS’s goal is to make CO2 emissions look irrelevant to #climatechange, so #fossilfuels will look good. This industry doesn’t need defendants
5804 2018-04-03 12:53:44 Bowman?  Isn't he on his way out also? Where in the rule book does it say the Big 6 get to pick who is in charge of the VA?  Does the Oil, Gas and Coal industry get to pick who is in charge of the Dept of Energy?
5805 2018-04-03 12:53:40 Who knew waiting for an oil change would stir the creative juices.
5806 2018-04-03 12:53:39 No, wrong.  He didn't speak directly to "the people," he spoke directly to the uneducated and unintelligent people who bought his snake oil, hook line and sinker. You know why he loves the uneducated?  He can control and manipulate you, and looks like he's doing a great job.
5807 2018-04-03 12:53:33 Really wish he was supported by his state or national dealer association.  Unfortunately they’ve pushed this administration and many before to abandon public health protections and oil import reductions.

5838 2018-04-03 12:50:12 Equipment, large or small, uses oil which is what keeps your engine running. It acts as a lubricant to keep all the moving parts inside the engine working smoothly; it also helps to reduce the amount of heat in your engine that arises from friction. #gotoil

5850 2018-04-03 12:49:13 John, we agree on A LOT, but I think we all know that there was no real competition against Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie or the others. Who could honestly compete with US Steel and Standard Oil?
5851 2018-04-03 12:48:57 There used to be anti-combine laws that limited how large a company can get.
It is meant to curb monopolies and encourage competition.

Used in early 20th century to break up the oil industry.

America needs to review this for broadcasting. To encourage free speech NOTsilence
5852 2018-04-03 12:48:49 another tip for toothache, for when the ice packs need refreezing, is a dab of clove oil. Horrible taste and quite unpleasant but very quickly soothes even the most painful of toothy issues. Good upcycling, though, thank you for sharing. Hope it gets better soon.- Niall

6188 2018-04-03 12:01:22 Part and parcel of the fraudulent “MAGA” campaign, which seeks to recreate a mythological America of the 1950s. This idea appeals to Trump’s base, while licensing Big Oil and the like to take in more massive profits.

6207 2018-04-03 11:59:05 @EPA says Obama admin goal of 50mpg for autos by 2025 is unrealistic. Maybe financially costly for auto-makers and oil companies, but I find it hard to believe the technology is unavailable to make cars that can average of 50mpg. Just another way Trump is screwing the country.

6314 2018-04-03 11:44:09 #LCHF @MarikaSboros @ProfTimNoakes Stopped fuming. Took big breaths, agree to prepare dieticians food for hubby with a small changes. We'll substitute all carbs with veg and meat, fake snacks with real food, low fat dairy with full cream and the marg and canola oil with butter.

6317 2018-04-03 11:44:01 Say what you will about Saudi, but I find it charming how there's still places where you get Nibelung-style family feuds over lost treasure.

Granted, oil money isn't as quaint as real gold, but you take what you get with modernity.
6318 2018-04-03 11:43:53 @loosewomen I've started taking legal CBD oil for the last week. Within an hour of taking the first spray I've noticed its wiped out 90% of my anxiety and I feel like a new woman. If this can help me in a week it'll do wonders for that little kid. Tell mum to keep pushing this 
6319 2018-04-03 11:43:37 In order to increase his tax collection Mr. Arun Jaitley increased taxes on diesel and petrol nine times between November 2014 and January 2016. The entire benefit of low oil prices went to the government by way of higher taxes.. ACCHE DIN?

6326 2018-04-03 11:42:59 Canadian eco-terrorists, the Linerals and NDP are ok with the countries they represent - using oil - to produce products we need such as roofs, just not Canada. After all we can import these goods. Their goal is to ensure we’re a customer of foreign countries not a competitor.

6330 2018-04-03 11:42:36 For almost 50 years, Shell has financed wars, polluted rivers, killed innocents  just to steal their oil and sell to you at an exorbitant price.
6331 2018-04-03 11:41:55 @PutinRF The oil agreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia prevents the West from monopolizing oil prices and the oil agreement. The oil exporting countries can control oil prices

6339 2018-04-03 11:40:52 Mexico produces a lot of manufactured goods for the world economy, unlike Russia which produces only oil and gas (latter mainly for Europe). And American LNG exports coming on line now will make even 1/2 of that equation obsolete.
6340 2018-04-03 11:40:52 Anointing oil is not necessarily olive oil.
6341 2018-04-03 11:40:48 @PutinRF Adhering to the policy of reducing production will raise oil prices in the long run and preserve the oil wealth of Russia from wasting at a cheap price

6365 2018-04-03 11:36:44 Tina most of the people who push for letting more people in aren't dealing with the consequences of it--less affordable housing, reduced wages, diluted political power. You don't make a vinaigrette by dumping the oil in all at once. You gotta drizzle and whisk.

6373 2018-04-03 11:35:15 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
6374 2018-04-03 11:35:14 Obama's "fuel efficiency standard" would require all vehicles to get 55 mpg by the year 2025.

By repealling this standard the Trump administration ensured that future cars will have lower mpg, meaning you have to buy more gas, thus bringing in more $$$ to the oil companies.

6401 2018-04-03 11:29:11 I’ve always followed the water-based before oil rule, so the order would be post-cleansing: exfoliation (pads), eye cream (if using), water cream, and finally Luna facial oil.
6402 2018-04-03 11:29:01 Not even joking; a few years ago we had a clear out of our kitchen cupboards and there was a bottle of olive oil, tucked in a corner, best before 1984. Mortifying.

6415 2018-04-03 11:26:44 PMB has already achieved more dan OBJ & his successors. Nigeria economy is fast moving away from being oil dependent to being agric inspired.

6510 2018-04-03 11:14:36 Finance Minister @arunjaitley increased taxes on diesel and petrol nine times between November 2014 and January 2016. The entire benefit of low oil prices went to the government and wasn't passed to consumer. 
Now when oil prices are increasing FM must reduce the taxes on fuel.
6511 2018-04-03 11:14:32 At what cost do we strive
for the moon
just to be loved and held
I pay the price of my heart
with the slow burn of midnight oil

until my last breath I will wade
in the dark solitude of ink & stars

& dream of you
upon a fragrant bed of poetry

The oil refinery fire picture is a giveaway of lazy scaremongering. Amazingly, the rest of the article hits an even lower level of accuracy.

6740 2018-04-03 10:41:01 Palm oil is in pretty much every packaged product, especially desserts. Also chocolate candy. It's disgusting that it now appears in so many food products. Orangutans will be extinct soon, there is no doubt about that. 
6741 2018-04-03 10:40:55 Maybe the highest offensive potential but a huge risk. Big bust potential due to attitude and, from accounts, not a “nice guy”.  Great offence but has shown little defensive awareness and battle. If he’s there at 38 but too risky in top 15. Oil can’t afford a bust.

6747 2018-04-03 10:40:14 @nancyilloh, we know that economic performance is still weak, with trend growth below peers. Thus we hope the FG will use the meeting to look into ways by which the non-oil-sector can be  improve to help support higher economic growth and fiscal revenues in the next 12 months!

6770 2018-04-03 10:35:20 That was back when the price of oil was over $100/barrel... even $120/barrel.  Currently is $63.  Imagine how much gas would cost with oil prices from then and the taxes of 2018.  Eventually we will see that.
6771 2018-04-03 10:34:47 How would a supply-side interception in NZ to ban oil has gas exploration do anything at all to address what is a demand-side issue, with increasing demand? It wouldn’t reduce global emissions at all - it would just shift production offshore.

6780 2018-04-03 10:33:39 All oil companies have proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that they cannot extract and transport oil without periodically causing massive disasters. They should pay even if it bankrupts them, jobs in this field are poison anyway.

7025 2018-04-03 09:42:50 I wud imagine that trumpski and putinski are going to iron out the deal on fine points on trumpski announcement that US is going to leave Syria to putin & iran to split up the oil fields. Assad will be high on the list to be put out upon putin/iran take over.
7026 2018-04-03 09:42:43 Carlsbad isn't really; it's got some mineral springs that made them choose that name but it mainly is a natural gas and oil town that does a sideline in tourism from people visiting the caverns and another in nuclear waste storage

7146 2018-04-03 09:16:29 She wasn't responsible for the inflation 27% lie when the Tories came to power in May 1979. Yes inflation was 27% in July 1975 but July 1975 is not May 1979. And that 27% inflation was largely caused by the OPEC oil rises from 1973 due to the Yom Kippur war and the Barber Boom.
7147 2018-04-03 09:16:17 Just watch as #MATD shapes up further to become 'The' Oil share of choice over the coming weeks. Don't forget the potential prize here.

7168 2018-04-03 09:13:31 It’s funny how Damjuma, a former military man and even high ranking can become an oil block owner. By what means did he become that? And now,he is talking like someone who worked for wealth. As if he is dangote or bill Gate. But such is the level of impunity & senselessness here

7174 2018-04-03 09:12:36 Pretty easy question. Cooking oil or gasoline?
7175 2018-04-03 09:12:27 そうともいう
7176 2018-04-03 09:12:12 This Damjuma man was a General who became and Oil Block owner by corruption. He father’s land never had oil block. By corruption and favoritism, he became the owner of an entire oil block and he is paying royalties to the people that awarded him the block forever. Corrupt man

7178 2018-04-03 09:11:51 So for 160lb. body weight goal, eat 160g protein & 160g fat (~ 1lb 80/20% ground beef, 4 eggs, 1 can sardines, 1 avocado, 1 string cheese, 1 handful nuts), 160g berries (~ 1 cup strawberries), and a green salad with 1 tbls. olive oil = ~ 2200 calories.
7179 2018-04-03 09:11:39 Very fair assessment.

7201 2018-04-03 09:05:15 Does not explain Saudi Arabia. Which can't be just answered with "oil", plenty of other countries have a lot of oil, too (Iraq, Iran...). Disregards that culture/religion in Asian countries like Japan/South Korea changed only later on, when they were already developing rapidly.
7202 2018-04-03 09:04:44 I’m glad you didn’t mention an oil rig. You know how the word “rig” gets me all riled up after these rigged elections
7203 2018-04-03 09:04:37 Guys it's really good to listen that now we can ave our calories everyday as oil contains 40% less on your favourite @mcdonaldsindia mayonnaise #McDFoodStory

Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?

I see advertisements for cold pressed High Oleic Sunflower Oils with a special variety (non GMO) sunflower seed that is low in omega 6 & high in Omega 9. Is this safe to eat?

To me this is still a cold pressed plant oil. What are your thoughts?

7234 2018-04-03 08:57:48 ‘Throwaway’ clothing is a huge issue. The textiles industry is the second biggest emitter after oil & gas. Consumers have a huge role to play here, at home as well as as customers. We don’t wear ~3rd of what we own.

7242 2018-04-03 08:55:42 Well, I watch @tracyalloway and @youseftv regularly on my Apple TV at nights because they cover both Middle East and oil just perfectly. I meant world events in general.

7294 2018-04-03 08:43:10 It is not real, it is being artificially created due to Syria, Iran, oil/gas resources and NATO expansion. Demonising Russia and then China is part of the plan as spheres of influence are being threatened. Stimulates defence spending and minimises scrutiny of domestic policy.
7295 2018-04-03 08:43:06 Frying would be the fastest way to cook pork meat though roasting is much healthier to get rid of the excess fat. Well, frying with palm oil is the best option. Faster and somewhat healthier I guess.
7296 2018-04-03 08:42:45 The way you rock this matter. We will need to baptise you with olive oil. . . .You are doing great
7297 2018-04-03 08:42:45 Ppl stopped worrying about peak oil a decade ago. Concern is environmental catastrophe if we burn that oil.

7596 2018-04-03 07:39:39 Climate change is opening up the Arctic - they need to make sure we stay dependent on oil. Putin also controls much of the world’s energy resources, I believe. He needs the world dependent also.

8080 2018-04-03 05:55:14 All well and good but renewables aren’t the solution. Coal (oil and gas) are required if South Africa is to continue to develop.
8081 2018-04-03 05:55:03 Because someone (or more) have control of the oil and don't want to go bankrupt, so they made it hard and scary for everyday people to stop using their oil. 
Too bad it didn't work out. Just the cars were pretty pricey, but the idea is a good one.

8089 2018-04-03 05:53:37 He is so rich off his wealthy donors he doesn't care about most voters.  I'm sure this tax cut means he'll have his own private jet (he won't even have to ask a special interest oil lobbyist for rides anymore), so he's insulated from having to face Americans for what he's done.
8090 2018-04-03 05:53:09 This might give insight into the latest round of “no climate change” and no need for regulations on mpg for autos. Keep everyone dependent on oil. What a corrupt president. Will he ever go away!?!?

No-one on wheels can get in our out, or get around inside. The building itself is/was beautifully accessible.
8272 2018-04-03 05:20:14 The @GOP Trump White House is "investigating" @EPAScottPruitt renting luxury DC condo for $50 from a Big Oil lobbyist while giving preferential treatment to that lobbyist's oil company clients.

You can't even get a room at Super 8 for $50. 

WH itineration is, of course, a sham.

8416 2018-04-03 04:57:31 Decreasing emissions requires retarding the timing, etc which reduces fuel economy & oil life.  Keeping fuel stds as they are now will actually allow better fuel economy than what would have been accomplished under the previous std, thus lowering emissions w/o higher costs!

8446 2018-04-03 04:52:33 Although they have made huge improvements in fuel efficiency, only so much can be done as engines are not very efficient in nature. luckily though. Americans still like heavy gas guzzling vehicles like the F150, which is great for the oil market,
8447 2018-04-03 04:52:32 Almost all of the increase in domestic production under Obama came from state and private lands that he did not control. In fact Obama closed off oil drilling in thousands of square miles of public land. So he really did nothing to help the oil industry

8456 2018-04-03 04:51:22 It's not contradictory . It just illustrates what happens when you leverage yourself too much and depend on high oil prices to pay for everything . Chavez did that. SA had the ability to turn up or down its output and has had that ability for 2 decades . It 's not a conspiracy.

8462 2018-04-03 04:50:26 When crude oil price was above $100/barrel before 2014, the BJP was protesting against high Petrol/Diesel prices. Since 2014, crude prices have fallen: now the price is $68/barrel. Yet, why do Petrol/Diesel prices in India keep rising?

Does PM care for the middle classes & poor?

8485 2018-04-03 04:46:52 Actually it isn’t an essential oil as it is typically CO2 extracted. (Also CBD is too heavy to transfer over during steam distillation) this means most CBD is a CO2 extract (btw we estimate about 60% of CBD oil on market isn’t really CBD)

8540 2018-04-03 04:38:13 The payouts are a quid pro quo for allowing the oil companies to operate in Alaska. It's just that the state actually shares the money with its citizens instead of transferring it to the treasury. California could do the same thing if the environmentalists were willing to share.

8565 2018-04-03 04:33:19 Yes, and there is no proof on us colluding with SA to pump more oil and flood the market . The Saudis wanted our increase production to stop and thought that if they did increase production it would bankrupt the US oil industry. having a non diversified economy  is a big risk.

8705 2018-04-03 04:08:09 Ya know... CBD oil has caught my interest lately, I am still kind of skeptic cuz it's easy to run into misinformation,scams,etc but it has caught my eye, to help with anxiety and such
8706 2018-04-03 04:07:36 also another good trick is to seal it in with an oil at the end if your skin can handle it.

8714 2018-04-03 04:06:01 I really had no idea!! My previous car I knew I’d have to get an oil change every 5000 miles, but I thought that was bc it was a super precaution thing to keep the dealership’s warranty covered since I had to drive back to their specific center to get work done

8721 2018-04-03 04:05:20 You bought one before?  That's a shame.  And I don't ever buy a damn thing from anyone that wears a cross for all to see.  It is snake oil at best, but with snake oil salesmen, the show is so much better.

8780 2018-04-03 03:55:28 My stance on #CrudeOil has always been that economic growth won't be the driver of demand, population growth will. That along with geopolitical tensions around the globe and surely it's only a matter of time before we are looking at an #ATH for #Oil again. #OOTT

8798 2018-04-03 03:53:58 @Mark_J_Perry  Hi!
Peak oil claim=oil price must cover cost; shale took off when price was met, and has since introduced efficiencies. Peak=easy well harvest/cheap is over. Now deeper water/ground sources required.

(Ref:The Long Emergency by Kunstler)

Is that a fair statement?

8800 2018-04-03 03:53:30 I would never buy any product from you because of your reputation and your corrupt business practices - companies like yours support institutions like Fox News because of the rather low intelligence level of many of their viewers-that's why snake oil people like u advertise there
8801 2018-04-03 03:53:24 Combine that with the economic damage trump is doing to Russia by allowing the USA to out produce them on oil and gas it server cripples Russia, their whole economy is tied to the gas prices, Putin can't do sblt now, trump is a genius haha

8843 2018-04-03 03:47:22 I am wondering if I can get a tax credit from the borough for all the shipping costs I incur from companies in the lower 48. You wanna know how much it costs me to send a carton of 10x20 growing flats up here? 

Over $100.

Go cry me a river Alaska oil companies. #akleg
8844 2018-04-03 03:47:18 You know the weather is perfect when your coconut oil isn't solid
8845 2018-04-03 03:47:18 Along with everyone else not named Talbot...which brings me back to my original point. These games mean nothing...good or bad.
8846 2018-04-03 03:47:07 Just gonna cover myself in coconut oil, get into bed, and pretend everything’s fine. 
8847 2018-04-03 03:46:55 Also for dry skin sometimes using a facial oil in addition to moisture helps on the bad days. Like argan oil, maracuja oil.
8848 2018-04-03 03:46:36 hablando del baby oil...
8849 2018-04-03 03:46:34 ExxonStan where the oil goes to Homs for processing & is sold back marked up, sure.
8850 2018-04-03 03:46:31 So even the ultimate clean green power machine that only works part time (kinda reminds me of our Pretend Minister) still needs oil products even after it has been built, delivered and commissioned....does that get factored into it’s footprint?  better tell #crookedcathy
8851 2018-04-03 03:46:23 It's sad that in 2018 my only source of income has been big oil and tobacco. Wish $btc would have made me money this quater. Instead #chevron & #altria have been keeping me afloat.
8852 2018-04-03 03:46:16 I know I’m definitely late to the game but essential oil diffusers are so

8863 2018-04-03 03:45:11 My car been telling me to get a oil change soon for about 2 weeks now and today I finally checked to see how much oil left and why that shit said 2% 
8864 2018-04-03 03:45:10 i used non-thc indica oil sublingually for a long time, knocked me tf out without feeling groggy later & helped with RLS & ptsd! just make sure you get at least ~5 hours sleep before you work or drive cus extracts are legit 
8865 2018-04-03 03:44:55 I do to as they make millions then want us to pay them! We have lower taxes over all.. thats because they let the oil employees vote!

8941 2018-04-03 03:35:53 Common practice in Australia by big oil. Load local company up with debt by lending from head company to Aus subsidiary at 9% - get interest deduction under Aussie tax legislation. Most foreign oil companies have made a tax profit in Australia over the last decade.
8942 2018-04-03 03:35:53 Which helped cut back on pollution & cut back demand for foreign oil!
8943 2018-04-03 03:35:46 I can't remember my SAT score; respectable but not great IIRC. I did well in school but hated every minute of it. That's part of the reason I never got through grad school or went back and finished later.

8965 2018-04-03 03:34:07 I tried it with my vape. It did make me a bit sleepy, but I already have a bad sleep schedule and cannot reliably attribute the sleepiness to the CBD oil alone. It was great to smoke as a nicotine-free alternative to e-juice, especially since I mostly vape to occupy my mind.
8966 2018-04-03 03:33:51 with sufficient butter, wine, garlic, and olive oil, spinach tastes awesome.  I will now cook the quinoa, cambucha, kale and any other tasteless crap the same. #healthy
8967 2018-04-03 03:33:49 No, not big players at all, but the vertical integration is a boon to the big oil sands producers, who are to some extent protected from the widening differential.
8968 2018-04-03 03:33:45 On what planet is bitumen "better oil"? It's high api, requires more processing... practically has the dirt still in it. That's why it's cheaper than WTI. 
I suppose it's "better" for paving roads with...
8969 2018-04-03 03:33:12 No not hypocrisy, Amazon needs to do more to facilitate sales tax by its 3rd party sellers. And you’re forgetting billions Obama gave to bankrupt green energy companies and handcuffing coal and oil.

8982 2018-04-03 03:31:25 I forgot to mention, but also some olive oil!! and if u have milk then add that and less water, but it's fine without it
8983 2018-04-03 03:31:21 Saddest Story in the World

This happened when I was in my second year of middle school
I suddenly put a straw in my dickhole
I thought I'd try pouring oil into it
I put a thin tissue into my dickhole
I set it on fire and my "thing" got burnt
Now it has no hope of recovery
8984 2018-04-03 03:31:11 The original scent is Lavender. 
No scent is just me not adding any scent to the oil.
8985 2018-04-03 03:31:11 Nah. It was well known of oil and gas in shale decades ago. How do you compete with better oil being bitumen. Get the world against it. Pretty simple. Keep it in the ground right?
8986 2018-04-03 03:31:05 Per oil and gas, we gave you Boone Picken Stadium, we can take it back.
8987 2018-04-03 03:30:55 My in-laws are English living in Scotland. I was there before the independence vote, which they supported. I asked them what the GDP of Scotland was and then I asked them how much funding they received from UK.  There really was no contest, North Sea oil not withstanding.
8988 2018-04-03 03:30:52 Coconut oil is the best hair mask. My hair always feels sooooo amazing after. 
8989 2018-04-03 03:30:47 The alamodome is a football stadium. As is Lucas Oil and AT&T haha I thought it was obvious.
8990 2018-04-03 03:30:38 Can’t speak for the effectiveness of it on sleep but CBD oil is basically just all the parts of weed that make you get high taken out and all the medicine parts stay in. I’d imagine that the relaxation effect, possible drowsiness, and pain-blunting would help you sleep
8991 2018-04-03 03:30:29 I have a bad habit of using a brush handle as a dildo while in the shower for anal and using to much baby oil for lube that my ass feels like its bade of soap and will slip on anything and i have to roll out of the tub like an old lady cause ill fall if i try to get up.

Don't forget, we also have an AMAZING 
TOPICAL PAIN RUB CREAM
Here are just one of many REAL TESTIMONIES on how it has worked for others

8993 2018-04-03 03:30:25 If they knew anything about skincare they would know your not supposed to put coconut oil on your face
8994 2018-04-03 03:30:23 Quite possibly because of the oil crisis but compared to the 60's I should think.
8995 2018-04-03 03:30:23 CBD oil can be used pretty easily as a sleep aid, but basically using any sort of weed to treat an illness or its symptoms is less a magic bullet and more loaded dice- you'll probably get a good effect, but you might not, so if you try it, please understand
8996 2018-04-03 03:30:23 Why do I always look fucking sweaty. I wash my face in the morning and the oil is under control for 15 minutes and I'm OVER IT
8997 2018-04-03 03:30:16 シャッフルバンドの作詞作曲事情について考えていたがとびっきりぶっ飛んで楽しもうはいったいどうするんだ
8998 2018-04-03 03:30:11 Ha ah oil. Dia ada 45 ml , 60 something. Pernah try tester, cam best.
8999 2018-04-03 03:30:09 I don’t. I’ve signed @350 pledge to refuse contributions from oil, gas, and coal companies because our children deserve a future with clean air and water. Doesn’t seem that hard to understand priorities. Money or health? I’m on health every time. #Peacock4Congress #CA42

9004 2018-04-03 03:29:57 Haven't you figured out that I always read it yet?
Tellyawhat, Gill: YOU read it. Then show me where it says anything abt US access to CDN oil. Of COURSE they want to stop petrol development. That isn't at issue. All I'm trying to figure out is how it's a nationalism thing.
9005 2018-04-03 03:29:57 My dad traded smoking for CBD oil because the smoke was causing more issues (for him) than it was helping. The oil worked well for his PTSD and insomnia while keeping other “side effects” to a minimum
9006 2018-04-03 03:29:57 Hope they ship my body oil tomorrow.
9007 2018-04-03 03:29:55 The Terry Fox used to have 5 companions, all working in the Beaufort Sea. I think they were all sold, as there is less interest in the Beaufort sea oil and less need for icebreakers due to much longer periods with no ice. The Terry Fox still operates in the st-lawrence gulf.

9014 2018-04-03 03:28:57 Remember Putin started his kleptocracy by jailing Khodorkovsky of Yukos Oil..the richest man in Russia in 2003.  The Russia we see today was a direct outgrowth of this Putin action.

DJT is simply executing on this playbook and Bezos of Amazon is the richest man currently in US.

9023 2018-04-03 03:27:26 If you have oily skin and a you over wash it, it’s drying it out so your skin is trying to make its natural oil thus even more oily skin. Once at the end of the day is enough.

9032 2018-04-03 03:26:01 It's their own fault for putting our oil underneath Argentina.
9033 2018-04-03 03:25:57 They bet the farm (or rather the oil patch) on the Wahhabis. Whom they allied themselves with after their pals in Germany lost the war- a very profitable war for the al-Bush clan, as wars tend to be. GHWB thought they were a good counter to the Iranians. 

That worked out well...

9039 2018-04-03 03:25:14 Your un-cited link is basically correct. Environmental interests do not want that oil piped to market. 
Vivian Krause and the rest of these nutballs think that it has something to do with American access to Canadian oil. This is unsupported and batshit loony.

9051 2018-04-03 03:24:02 Your a lobbiest puppet. Why would Americans want dirtier air AND more expensive transportation costs? Why don’t you ask the people what they prefer instead of letting oil companies make the decision for us? Asshat.
9052 2018-04-03 03:23:58 I braided my hair down with some oil tonight just so it’s more stretched, but I haven’t had to add anymore product since Saturday.
9053 2018-04-03 03:23:53 @dpradhanbjp  If the govt wants to stick to Market Price policy for the petroleum products is fine but when the Crude Oil prices went down why the govt increased the excise tax several times and why the Govt doesn't stick to the Market Price policy on petroleum products.

9055 2018-04-03 03:23:29 We have one right where we get on the Interstate. It's our closest gas station. We don't buy there unless we have to. They're expensive. I think it's the location. 
I've asked Sinclair (the oil company) for clarification. Sinclair Station ≠ Sinclair Station...necessisarily.

9067 2018-04-03 03:22:08 So. We're not supposed to pump gas on April 15 to stick it to the oil companies. 
But then we will all pump gas on April 14/16/17 to make up for it, and the companies will still get those dollars, so what's the difference?

9112 2018-04-03 03:16:43 Wow I'm so fucking dead out of ideas I'm like a goddamn cast iron skillet with absolutely zero food or oil or butter or anything in it, just a dry, hot iron skillet that's progressively breaking down because it's constantly getting heated but there's nothing in it to cook.
9113 2018-04-03 03:16:34 The last thing anyone who was *actually* worried about their "carbon footprint" would do, would be to have grandkids.

9123 2018-04-03 03:15:25 Ignoring the elephant in the room will not help Albertans in the long run.

9148 2018-04-03 03:10:18 Thanks for the legal advice Mr "securities fraud expert" but if that was the case the oil companies should be suing California legislators for wrongfully accusing them of causing "climate change" when California & Californians are the ones consuming the fossil fuels themselves

If the SEC isn't looking into connections with Trump, his cabinet members, and anyone associated with them, they're not doing their job.

9170 2018-04-03 03:06:30 That’s not quite correct.  Offshore client is posted in USD, but all gains returned in CNY and ultimately CNH if repatriated.  Hence higher oil price increases global supply of RMB.

9229 2018-04-03 02:58:44 Coconut oil works fine on my face but I’m not acne prone at all. I definitely still warn people to be careful with it though since it’s comedogenic.
9230 2018-04-03 02:58:31 I’d imagine the flavor profile (if fried/sautéed in coconut oil and tossed in vinegar) would be similar! Coconut oil is just super gf/allergen (other than coconut of course) safe so my work uses it.
9231 2018-04-03 02:58:27 I’ve only been using the oil for a few weeks. Can’t be longer than 2 months using it.

9245 2018-04-03 02:56:56 putting oil on my body is so satisfying & my skin be looking so good I wanna cuff myself 
9246 2018-04-03 02:56:36 Hemp had the power to challenge many establishment industries. Especially cotton, and oil.
9247 2018-04-03 02:56:34 @EPAScottPruitt needs to go & go with haste.  This guy has his head so far up the big oil & gas industry butt.  He screwed Oklahoma & is doing the same to the country.  He sued the EPA so many times, CONFLICT, in a world where conflict of interests apply.
9248 2018-04-03 02:56:26 Same as electric cars getting boosted by a oil driven generator 
9249 2018-04-03 02:56:15 You know your cars only run on about 20% gas efficiency so that the oil industry can make more profit?
9250 2018-04-03 02:56:11 Trump’s a grifter.  It’s all about the oil.   The Aramco IPO will be interesting.
9251 2018-04-03 02:55:53 Sir govt not able to control oil price,today petrol price in mumbai rs.81.87/ltr.it is pathetic and common can't survive,past govt what did,it doesn't matter but current govt is not able to reduce the price &it will directly impact coming election,pls note down.
9252 2018-04-03 02:55:31 What does black seed oil do.?
9253 2018-04-03 02:55:30 Sqalene is a natural 30-carbon organic compound originally obtained for commercial purposes primarily from shark liver oil and used as a lubricant in small-gear systems like watches. It's also found in the creases of the human nose.

9254 2018-04-03 02:55:30 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
9255 2018-04-03 02:55:23 I used lemongrass oil in my diffuser and omg... it smells amazing
9256 2018-04-03 02:55:06 I loved the Representative that posted Hogg's reddit gripe of a 4.25 GPA but couldn't show on the SAT/ACT that he had a better score than a turnip.
9257 2018-04-03 02:54:48 If they had a huge supply of uranium, oil or opium....we'd be hunkered down over there for decades.
9258 2018-04-03 02:54:47 Olive Oil is pretty great for the complexion, it's true.
9259 2018-04-03 02:54:39 @BeerLeagueHeroe Just curious, are the Oilers still turning that proverbial corner or is it just these these final few games that don't matter 
9260 2018-04-03 02:54:39 Conservatives that bitch about CBD oil for pets are the same people that buy toxic treats from walmart.
9261 2018-04-03 02:54:25 Masks and drinking more water

Also eating more fish or taking fish oil pills. Omega 3's, Vitamin E.
9262 2018-04-03 02:54:25 You need to be more positive. We’re coming up on the 1yr. anniversary of the Oil making the playoffs. Remember the good times. #LetsGoOilers
9263 2018-04-03 02:54:25 My sister was saying how she broke out from using a processed af coconut oil on herself in the sauna, and i told her that it’s because it’s full of chemicals/processed shit it’s not natural and unrefined so she got mad and was like you smoke weed so what you say is invalid
9264 2018-04-03 02:54:24 Girl that’s cuz u nasty and like them cooked in a bunch of oil
9265 2018-04-03 02:54:17 You moved the goalpost from the spread of communism, to a dispute over fishing/oil drilling rights. That being said, I don't believe China is going to threaten US sovereignty of its borders, when it's borders aren't anywhere in the south china sea.
9266 2018-04-03 02:53:54 My roommate keeps putting peppermint oil in the diffuser and smells like freakin toothpaste in my room #sendhelp
9267 2018-04-03 02:53:50 yep, lesson learnt ;; i only have garlic infused oil with me rn so i'll have to wait till the grocer reopens tomorrow to get some butter huhu
9268 2018-04-03 02:53:48 Iron Oil Rig
9269 2018-04-03 02:53:46 I'm generally sensitive to MSGs. Sometimes I get lucky though with fried foods and I don't get sick. Empanadas usually don't give me problems but I got some from a restaurant today and I won't eat there again.  I think there may be some type of oil or something my body rejects.
9270 2018-04-03 02:53:45 I say we worry about running out of oil when we actually begin to run out, like, say in about 300 years.
9271 2018-04-03 02:53:31 Coconut Oil your Doc Martens. #thankmelater
9272 2018-04-03 02:53:24 They are doing it, they own most of the oil in Venezuelan, they are keeping Maduro a float. If they gain Colombia they gain more Oil, this means they will have two large countries in south America. Trump gave them back Cuba.Nowtrump will give the white house to Putin, game over.

9274 2018-04-03 02:53:09 @elonmusk @ElonMuskNewsOrg my question is, are you not replacing one limited natural resource (oil) with another (lithium) ? Also @SpaceX for composite ?
9275 2018-04-03 02:52:54 OY, ubos na yung olive oil. WAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH :D
9276 2018-04-03 02:52:45 早安美丽的星期二

若要成功，
就必須先相信自己是可以做到的~ add oil!!
9277 2018-04-03 02:52:34 Girl I have so many random things I’ve been researching and using, but by far the best thing I’ve done was start making face masks and lotion myself! My faves are activated charcoal, bentonite clay, matcha powder, vitamin E oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil & raw shea butter!!
9278 2018-04-03 02:52:18 私が男キャラを描くと若がえる
9279 2018-04-03 02:52:11 People are still enjoying the “We went into Iraq for oil” fairytale
9280 2018-04-03 02:52:06 Rob, you can’t be a shill because you are the snake oil salesmen himself.
9281 2018-04-03 02:51:49 it’s about not stripping your skin of oil so your skin stops over producing sebum (which is the bacteria’s food source). try an oil cleanser and maybe raw aloe ? (IF you’re not allergic, ive seen reactions)
9282 2018-04-03 02:51:31 Haven’t watched TV at all since the beginning of February. It’s been really nice not having to listen to the broadcast drones. Living in the land of Sinclair oil makes it tough to not fuel at their stations though. Sinclair owns this neck of the woods.
9283 2018-04-03 02:51:29 Arriving home on Sunday. So looking forward to eating food that does not contain butter/sugar/oil/salt/cheese!
9284 2018-04-03 02:51:29 Tea tree oil. 100% guaranteed success. Couple dabs a day on a WART Can zap it in two weeks
9285 2018-04-03 02:51:15 argan oil in your hair and on your cuticles. made my nails SO much stronger and stop breaking, and moisturizes your cuticles like crazy. and in my hair, it made it stop breaking so it grew really long and got less frizzy!
9286 2018-04-03 02:51:06 HAZELWOOD was not a junk,functional  Steam-Turbine  Generator,COAL FIRED BOILER could be easily converted to NATURAL GAS,exept that 'our property' was sold to French-Jap Business here to make PROFITS at our expense. ELECTRICITY like ARAB OIL became a TOOL to gouge prices from US.
9287 2018-04-03 02:51:01 I can imagine the regulated utility businesses would do that business all day. The bulk of vehicles will charge at off-peak hours anyhow. Some suggest an “internet of eletricity”- a bit too sexy for me. The fundamentals are there with the “smart home” innovations.
9288 2018-04-03 02:51:00 It's so much like it was during VietNam. Some, especially those who had a lot to gain from oil profits (e.g. LBJ), didn't want that war to end. JFK got a lot of grief from his own VP.
9289 2018-04-03 02:51:00 Black seed oil, bio-active Manuka honey, beta glucans, and liquid chlorophyll are 4 things you should 100% buy if you come across them
9290 2018-04-03 02:50:54 Need a wax oil cartridge plug ??? 
9291 2018-04-03 02:50:23 Okay... and we will also run out of oil. Maybe nuclear is the answer?
9292 2018-04-03 02:50:21 i wanna learn how to do oil painting
9293 2018-04-03 02:50:09 I hate to be the one to say that oil cleansing has been a game changer but it's been a game changer.
9294 2018-04-03 02:50:04 They're not there just for the snake oil, they listen to the spew?
9295 2018-04-03 02:50:02 Thank you!! Any tips on baking vs frying? Sesame oil vs. olive oil? Oven temp? Seasoning/marinating? (Haha sorry so needy. I just haven’t been having success)
9296 2018-04-03 02:49:55 Smells like oil money in this thread.
9297 2018-04-03 02:49:55 Let me tell you! You can’t shrink or clean out the pores with strips. The stuff you see inside is sebaceous filaments which is just oil & dead skin. All the strips do is take off the surface of it which is temporary for a day maybe lol
9298 2018-04-03 02:49:54 They are mint! I have a jug and a mug that have lasted some greasy oil field roads!
9299 2018-04-03 02:49:43 It might be oil. Can’t confirm.
9300 2018-04-03 02:49:35 Yes. Why isn’t Alabama cspitalizing on commercial hemp production for things like hemp seed oil, hemp hulls, and textiles. Seems harmless to me
9301 2018-04-03 02:49:33 Organized my fridge, made banana bread/banana bread muffins and doing a coconut oil treatment on my hair - all before 8PM. Someone mail me a trophy 
9302 2018-04-03 02:49:27 Coconut oil & cantu leave in conditioner is all I put in my hair
9303 2018-04-03 02:49:16 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
9304 2018-04-03 02:49:15 i only wanna put the oil on him okay  theres no harm in it
9305 2018-04-03 02:49:11 It's straight alcohol, Hand sanitizers work by removing the outer layer of oil on your skin. If you don't use enough hand sanitizer — or you don't rub it in thoroughly — less than 99.9% of the germs on your hands will be killed

When trump cranked up Anwar oil and the rest of our oil industry 
It effectively nuked Putin's ONLY economic export by dumping the cost of crude oil!

Putin exports petro for cash and we dropped the world wide price. for 1
9310 2018-04-03 02:48:25 Bought everything BUT coconut oil. I'm annoyed!
9311 2018-04-03 02:48:24 This coconut oil on my eye lashes got me goin blind
9312 2018-04-03 02:48:08 @OatlyUK any idea why the Oatly milk I ordered from amazon US is darker in colour and more sweeter? I’ve bought in UK for 2 years. Just moved to USA? I know it’s made here and use Canola oil but can’t work out why it would taste and look different?
9313 2018-04-03 02:47:49 No, the CIA guy says "Do you really think they will print it?"

Fuckin' great and true flick. "What will they do when the oil is cut off?" (the other thing CIA guy says).

Also a great fight scene when the fake "postman" comes to the room...
9314 2018-04-03 02:47:41 Oil...that’s what it all boils down to.
9315 2018-04-03 02:47:35 おかきこっち帰ってきてんのか

9318 2018-04-03 02:47:22 Escalating oil prices would make #Modi . government realise that economy cannot be managed  with fabricated speeches. Unfortunately for #Modi government oil prices are rising, though still  at 60%  of what it was in 2014. Soon public cry will start due to impending inflation.
9319 2018-04-03 02:47:15 I’m on retinol for my stubborn blackheads! Does that oil help with that as well?
9320 2018-04-03 02:47:08 @MakerGeeks from a former oil patch guy myself - just found out about you and started the mystery thing for 30 a month. Looking forward to it man!
9321 2018-04-03 02:47:07 Use coconut oil it smooths the skin.
9322 2018-04-03 02:47:05 Why is it so easy for me to swipe my card for food and fun things but I'm stingy when its stuff I actually need like an oil change or some shit lmao
9323 2018-04-03 02:46:44 my window is open and my diffuser has chamomile oil in it and i have selenite by my head > >>>>>
9324 2018-04-03 02:46:40 It cooks by circulating hot air. No oil needed!
9325 2018-04-03 02:46:34 Saul tried to kill David, yet we never see David giving up on being King. When you are destiny focused you don’t let people not liking you cause you to run away from your destiny. The oil doesn’t flow because of popularity, it flows because you were chosen for this!

9326 2018-04-03 02:46:30 yay ty for the heads up about youtube! i’m trying to not use as much oil now and i got some new tips :)
9327 2018-04-03 02:46:27 Smart Norway doubled its carbon tax and they're already sitting on a $ Trillion that they've negotiated out of big oil instead of caving like AB PCs and #CPC
9328 2018-04-03 02:46:21 If they sell the oil then something has hapoened... And then there is Citgo... and who owns the largest US oil refinery at Port Arthur?
9329 2018-04-03 02:46:19 I know what I’m saying jordan, pls don’t hate. As you can see (pictured above) we are referring to the oil dipped sticks known as incest smh, get off my turf

9344 2018-04-03 02:43:54 Then they began to run studies on everything concluding that hemp was not only too superior as a renewable resource but that CBD oil was too beneficial to the human body so they began attacking it.

9356 2018-04-03 02:42:05 Looks like it's leaking oil...?
9357 2018-04-03 02:42:02 Oil was discovered in Uganda in 2006.

9359 2018-04-03 02:41:46 The real Achhe Din that we all should be talking about! Petrol 76.76/litre, despite int'l price of crude oil being at $63/barrell. Rest all are din that doesn't matter. Instead Govt. can openly declare as per dharm no one's suppose to drive except few god-touched ones like them.
9360 2018-04-03 02:41:44 Cut his head off! What did he actually do? Neither you or me know if he thought paying $50 a night was being frugal or the going rate to whore himself out. He apparently approved allowing more oil into the US pipelines, which was a campaign item (more energy).
9361 2018-04-03 02:41:30 . get you some peppermint oil
9362 2018-04-03 02:41:23 Don't let Pruitt fool you. He's a slimy snake and will never truly represent anything but the oil industry.

9367 2018-04-03 02:40:43 @shophoneyrose so I definitely placed 3 orders tonight  I really wanted that gloss that they said was out of stock so I made a second order with that code and I bought the oil earlier  I’m about to be so broke  and glowy 
9368 2018-04-03 02:40:41 Ok so I’m trying to bake it instead of fry it but maybe I need to re-evaluate. I did a little sesame oil but didn’t do a sauce. Do I add the sauce before or after? And do you like... pat it dry or something?
9369 2018-04-03 02:40:40 It takes a solid month before your oil levels even out, so dry shampoo will be your bestie during that time. I suggest making your own tho using arrowroot powder (and cocoa powder if your hair is brown)
9370 2018-04-03 02:40:31 So I wash my hair with baking soda and apple cider vingear once a week. 
The rest of the week I do a water wash. which is just water, but you scrub your head like youre using shampoo. It lifts your hair up and swishes the oil out.

9373 2018-04-03 02:40:17 Before coloring your hair, apply virgin coconut oil the night before. Leave it there overnight so there wouldn’t be too much damages in your hair. I feel your pain. My hair almost died with all the coloring that I’ve done on it.

9380 2018-04-03 02:39:26 education is a basic right! the biggest issue is that no one is running against those legislators when election season begins! and all are controlled by oil & natural gas companies in OK.... so disheartening
9381 2018-04-03 02:39:23 Cuanto más transparencia mejor. Que se boletas que demuestren todos los gastos:comidas,nafta o gas oil, neumáticos, líquido de frenos ,...etc.

Is 40 X sufficient magnification to screen? As compared to oil?

Hopefully #digitalpathology and #AI should deliver on such vexing issues. Fine focus big confounder?
9387 2018-04-03 02:39:07 what has teachings of  islam given to humanity.....?......arab world is rich only due to oil.....
9388 2018-04-03 02:39:04 But he's not at all concerned that he chose a big oil and gas  representative who is literally dismantling the entire agency. It's just the expensive vacation thing.. oh okay.
9389 2018-04-03 02:39:01 Yes, that's part of a solution that I've seen. We are an oil state. They won't touch it. Not until after election season anyway..

9402 2018-04-03 02:37:02 I read that article as the automakers lobbying for adjustments in implementing that seem within realm of legit debate (I am FOR stricter standards and higher mileage, btw). T seems to be going far more extreme - this smells like oil lobby.

9405 2018-04-03 02:36:35 Melting ice is one of the impacts of climate change. Polar bears will more likely starve. However, melting ice can increase shipping through waterways., which may have economic benefits but it can also raise the risk of oil spills and chemical spills. #Lesson12 #ClimateChange

9414 2018-04-03 02:35:04 I’m glad you said butter and not oil. 
9415 2018-04-03 02:34:59 Totally!

9421 2018-04-03 02:34:39 Yeah I never use any oil either, always enough fat in whatever food I’m cooking.
9422 2018-04-03 02:34:36 Taxes are cut drastically so oil companies and the wealthy  get a big gift and public schools,teachers, roads, public services suffer.  Why so people in Oklahoma vote Republicon? Why do they vote against own interest? I would really like to know.

9439 2018-04-03 02:32:32 My god, short of #MuellerTime, I can't think of a more satisfying possibility!!!! @EPAScottPruitt is a greedy, dishonest, unethical, big oil/gas/chem/coal-purchased, planet-polluting VILLAIN: the worst part of the hideous @realDonaldTrump administration... and THAT is something!
9440 2018-04-03 02:32:28 The same UN that elected Gadaffi to the Human Rights Council? The same UN that issues most of its resolutions toward Israel while allowing the worlds worst human rights abusers to get off scot free. The same UN filled with tin pot dictators & countries bought off by oil money?
9441 2018-04-03 02:32:26 Great so then we have 1 teacher for every 100 students. Who do you think will pay such an exorbitant starting salary? This is why economics and the left mix like oil and water.
9442 2018-04-03 02:32:23 teacher union fully supports its teachers in this protest. unfortunately our legislators allow their votes to be dictated by the hand that feeds them - oil and natural gas, but specifically a man named Harold Hamm... he controls legislators bc of his $$

9445 2018-04-03 02:32:16 You #ModiHetred should also tell country about that magic of UPA govt how they were selling oil on half of its purchase price. Is Sonia or Manmohan were paying from his pocket? Freebie lovers.
9446 2018-04-03 02:32:14 @DavidFrum: Equating Trumps business corruption to his administrations politics would be a kin to Bush business ties to oil, wars and politics, right? @worldoregon #WorldOregon #RhetoricalQuestion

9468 2018-04-03 02:29:22 ye i get the historical significance but imo that doesn't translate so well from oil-on-canvas italian landscapes to digital paintings of dense neo-noir settings
9469 2018-04-03 02:29:06 Yeah but with crio and stuff. And eliminating the mold toxins and stuff. And it helps your brain too cause fats from butter and avocados and bacon and MCT oil (coconut oil). Cause fats are the most efficient fuel for your brain and other organs. Plus gluten is bad and stuff.

9474 2018-04-03 02:28:47 He did. I'm saying that to look to ethanol as a replacement for oil is to build your house on sand. Better to transition off carbon fuels and to a society that model's what David Holmgren describes as Earth Stewardship or the Transition Town Movement advocates

9480 2018-04-03 02:27:54 I had a wage discrimination case onetime involving a large group of welders in the oil field servicing industry. We got it settled pretty quickly because every one of them made more per hour than either myself or the name partner at the defense firm.

9488 2018-04-03 02:26:45 To keep away unwanted guests, smear patchouli oil on door handles. (Make sure all family members are in the home when doing this.)
9489 2018-04-03 02:26:43 Given the topics I've covered on the podcast, I shouldn't be embarrassed about something like this, but, ugh...here goes: Does anyone use an essential oil diffuser? What about around cats? Don't judge me!
9490 2018-04-03 02:26:28 I hate bashing the Oil but they are shit for the most part.  Big changes yet again this off season
9491 2018-04-03 02:26:25 What is the recipe? is that mayo under the sardines? I use bagels as my bread for sardines. I pull out the center of the torus so my sardines and olive oil have a little channel to sit in and not leak out.

9500 2018-04-03 02:25:19 into the pockets of our legislators!!! if you look, OK teachers are ranked #50 in pay. Our legislators are ranked #17 in pay.... UNACCEPTABLE!!! and we have virtually no incoming $$ bc our main profit is oil/ntrl. gas & tax is v low on those!

9506 2018-04-03 02:24:18 Not so fast. Remember, @realDonaldTrump is actually scared of Pruitt. Pruitt represents the oil and gas industry; Trump will take the orders he is given. Putin likes Pruitt.
9507 2018-04-03 02:24:15 Another #FakeNews story that effects NO ONE! REAL NEWS: China dumped the #PetroDollar & is paying for oil in the gold backed #Yuan which Russia, Iran & other countries will soon follow. That's real news that effects real Americans. Trump sleeping w/a porn star doesn't effect us!

9510 2018-04-03 02:23:36 How can oil company's and government's justify the retail cost of gasoline at the pumps when oil hasn't risen . Between them, the consumer is being shafted. What a ripoff. Greedy scum.
9511 2018-04-03 02:23:10 Apparently a mix of oil, eggs, and cages
9512 2018-04-03 02:23:05 Yeah I’m just gonna get it done at jiffy lube or the Audi dealership from now on because the jiffy lube sticker said I don’t need another oil change for 5000 miles

9514 2018-04-03 02:22:29 You better tell Trump & his oil company pals. We don’t want gas guzzlers and neither does the rest of the world.
9515 2018-04-03 02:22:24 This is all about oil money. “They” want to keep the demand for oil strong because Russia needs the oil revenue. Plus the oil lobby in this country is strong and doesn’t want renewable energy eating into their profits.
9516 2018-04-03 02:22:23 I put peppermint oil on my face earlier and then accidentally touched my hooha.. it's tingling and cold

9519 2018-04-03 02:22:04 Seems weird. Synthetic oil should give you a longer period of life.
9520 2018-04-03 02:21:38 Amen!!!! and OK has the lowest GDP of all the states surrounding it!!! they will pay to drill here, because the oil is here!! raise the tax & begin a path to funding education.
9521 2018-04-03 02:21:37 Think of all the profits (prophets?) they can make just in the oil for the movie popcorn!!! 
9522 2018-04-03 02:21:33 The military at the moment cannot be said to be productive when it comes to revamping Nigerian economy. NYSC will do better involving heavily in agriculture and IT. State owned farms will gain from massive Corp manpower with available technology. Crude oil is no more in bloom.
9523 2018-04-03 02:21:14 Ok Grimlies, you all know about the head pain I've been having since July and how I've seen every doctor under the sun. Well I truly wawnt to try CBD oil because a friend let me try here, it actually eased the pain. Does anyone else use it? Send suggestions!!
9524 2018-04-03 02:21:09 ...make it to the store. That was truly embarrassing. I got some ginger ale and oil free crackers but it didn’t help. Luckily I made it to the next store. I slept in the WalMart parking lot. I was grateful for that random plastic bag and Subway napkins. I felt like I was pt2
9525 2018-04-03 02:20:42 @hughhewitt Wants more lead in water and for minority kids to breathe polluted air so oil CEOs can make more money
9526 2018-04-03 02:20:29 Fuck you, Oil.
9527 2018-04-03 02:20:25 Yes, solar thermal (using the sun to heat saline or mineral oil to over 500c) provides baseload power. Do some research yourself for once.
9528 2018-04-03 02:20:22 The argument is that a number of groups with refining and rail interests funded some legitimate environmental groups to land-lock Alberta oil. Nothing particularly complicated, simply an "enemy of my enemy" approach using the activist as cat's paws 1/

9532 2018-04-03 02:19:32 President Trump, impound funds destined to those countries. Limit imports of crude oil from Mexico for refining. Refuse to accept applications for asylum because international conventions require it to be sought from Mexico. Presidential finding that California is in rebellion.

9548 2018-04-03 02:17:10 Easy to forget the astonishing achievement in the face of the elements that is the North Sea Oil and Gas industry. This is a good reminder.
9549 2018-04-03 02:17:02 What a shame. Canada and the US sit on oil & gas reserves bigger than the middle east. The US is moving towards becoming oil independent and will be one of the largest exporters of oil.
But not Canada. Our leaders are sick.

9559 2018-04-03 02:15:42 When it comes to Native Americans especially that Lakota tribe. There's just no way we can be right, took the land,  then we just kept shrinking their reservation, then we have the balls to say that we have right away for a oil pipeline?
9560 2018-04-03 02:15:39 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?

9578 2018-04-03 02:12:59 I use a LCO method as I'm low porosity. Oils aren't moisturisers they seal moisture in. Creams are good or milk & butters. I usually use plain water with some aloe juice and leave in conditioner. Then seal it all up with an oil mix I created.

9586 2018-04-03 02:12:12 I find apple cider vinegar to be great for exfoliating the skin. It also helps a lot if you use coconut oil right after, because it creates a healthy protective barrier after the apple cider vinegar has removed all the dead skin cells.

9598 2018-04-03 02:09:30 So if you’re ever having mouth pain, clove and cinnamon essential oils help a whole lot. But make sure to mix it with coconut oil or your whole mouth will burn and then go numb

9648 2018-04-03 02:02:55 Do you deep condition? 

If not, you could try using olive oil for that process. 
Just basically coat your hair (from roots to end) with olive oil and cover your head with a plastic bag or shower cap (Pb is better because you need it to be sealed)

9653 2018-04-03 02:02:21 The oil companies are *literally* admitting as much in court, *right now*. They've conceded it - a plain fact, not worth disputing - and are trying to justify their response to this reality.

9665 2018-04-03 02:00:37 Still haven't gotten the process to the point where I'm totally happy, but it's getting there.  I love the look of the T-205 set, but it's tough to get the oil painting style just right.

9669 2018-04-03 02:00:13 Another #FakeNews story that effects NO ONE. REAL NEWS: China dumped the #PetroDollar and is paying for oil in #Yuan Russia Iran & others will soon follow the same route. That news effects Americans. Politicians has always blown our $. Nothing new there.

9671 2018-04-03 01:59:59 Yes, Pruitt thinks he is slick, just like Oil. Those things go better with Koch & Trump...

He does have the "standards" of Trump (ie book standards at all). 

Probably why he can't piss-off Trump (though Putin's Prostitutes seem to be able to piss Trump ON!)

However make sure it’s a quality product. There different forms of MCT oil derive from coconut oil. The best form in my opinion is capryli…
9690 2018-04-03 01:57:11 And probably everyone should stop mining coal & drilling for oil, to avoid accidentally breaking through to the caves of evil.  Seems fair tbh.
9691 2018-04-03 01:57:02 Agreed, its hard to see why Pruitt would be turfed out: ethical lapses/grift mean little to this WH unless they dominate the news (Pruitt's aren't as noted as Price's), he's efficiently serving the WH corporate masters' agenda (Koch, big oil).

9694 2018-04-03 01:56:43 Legit go to any live shop and they can do the oil change, whether it be synthetic or regular oil. Also the oil just has to be after 3000 for regular and 5000 for synthetic!
9695 2018-04-03 01:56:43 If a US oil co (or a few of them) cared about higher cost of Canadian oil, they could buy equity in Canadian oil co's to hedge it out.

9698 2018-04-03 01:56:23 Why are they committing antitrust violations against the American Public in favor of the pharmaceutical industry.  This is not acceptable.  There is a framework to allow lawful high cbd hemp oil as a food ingredient why are they trying to stop it?
9699 2018-04-03 01:56:13 Definitely. Not like the Oil from a couple years back
9700 2018-04-03 01:56:01 Utterly disgusting!! This is dangerous for the public's health. Cases of asthma, COPD and other respiratory disease will increase....all of this for what!?!? Head of EPA  and Oil& Gas make more $$$?
9701 2018-04-03 01:56:00 They are Traitors of the highest order. Selling down the Strategic Oil Reserve puts the American Homeland under direct threat, not to mention America could not come to the aid of trusted Allies. Trump needs to be executed for Treason. Death by hanging

9716 2018-04-03 01:53:34 Signs are cute and catchy. Taking this week to protest and making it up in the summer will do nothing.

“ Demand Financial Audit of Gov Mary Fallen and Big Oil!!! “
9717 2018-04-03 01:53:23 Can’t run oil if the previous guy fucks it up
9718 2018-04-03 01:53:13 Changing cooking oil destroyed the taste.  Mega mistake.
9719 2018-04-03 01:53:00 Nonexistent EPA mileage regs will definitely reduce the glut of US oil reserves that have hamstrung speculators ability to recklessly increase prices for the last 5-6 years.

Good job greedy b*stards.

9738 2018-04-03 01:50:36 Conversely, if US oil co's were really interested in constricting the Canadian export market (which they aren't), there would be better ways to go about it than... Funding an NGO that donates to another NGO and starts a protest? (I still don't get how it works.) Namely: buy them.
9739 2018-04-03 01:50:33 Is anyone else's skin literally incapable of not overproducing oil if they don't tone
9740 2018-04-03 01:50:31 TBH I wouldn't. Why would he be 1st EPA Director that has to fly 1st class or have his own private jet? Trump is killing everything that benefits rank & file employees, while @EPA Pruitt destroys the environment at the request of big oil, & mining. Blatant abuse of taxpayers
9741 2018-04-03 01:50:24 okay then ur good u just gotta be patient and buy a lot of coconut oil!! 
9742 2018-04-03 01:50:23 Yes, my point is Lucic didn't start the whole incident. Like you said, Lucic did a hockey play that happens after almost every shot. Gio crosschecking Lucic was the first illegal play. Yet people keep saying that Lucic was the instigator? Its like they never watched the game.
9743 2018-04-03 01:50:19 You can find them online, at stores like whole foods or Trader Joe’s… Pretty much anywhere you find healthy foods. However make sure it’s a quality product. There different forms of MCT oil derive from coconut oil. The best form in my opinion is caprylic acid. I hope that helps!

9749 2018-04-03 01:48:55 IDF doesn't need suadis airstrips to attack Iran , they need the back up they'll never have as China said years ago that any direct "war" vs Iran would be considered as another west attempt to cut China from oil ressources (i got the memory of a crow)
9750 2018-04-03 01:48:45 Yes!  God bless body oil and good lighting. The girls were all aglow
9751 2018-04-03 01:48:40 They aren't American because, like any other public company, they transcend nationalism. The stocks in your portfolio aren't concerned with what's best for the US any more than Canadian Oil co's are concerned with what's best for Canada.
9752 2018-04-03 01:48:08 k so my back has been killing me lately and chris rubbed this cbd oil stuff on it and he said it was bruised. so basically im dying

Japan & Germany learned that lesson the hard way in WW2.

9764 2018-04-03 01:46:49 @PostBaron Republicans think we're on some sort of oil/mineral quest disguised as a Holy War to wipe out Muslims and conquer Africa, while we're busy doing that, Russia promises to take out China, only they won't.  They'll come right up our backside through Alaska and Canada.

9767 2018-04-03 01:46:34 When will the people in Oklahoma stop voting for Republicans?  It is the Republicans who decreased funding for schools and teachers.  Maybe the legislators should stop throwing money away on fake women's health clinics and increase taxes on the rich and oil industries.

9782 2018-04-03 01:44:47 Of course he is. 

Main problem the party paid for by Big Oil donors is the California standard. If California announces a standard, it affects the whole market even if California is the only state to opt for it.

9800 2018-04-03 01:42:31 Facts not in evidence, Catherine. You need to stand up to your Big Oil masters and do the right thing for everyone...not just them.
9801 2018-04-03 01:42:26 This is a car company that doesn't even trust you to be able to check your own oil.
9802 2018-04-03 01:42:24 Fry pork with sesame oil
Before all pork is pink, add the garlic and ginger and brown the pork.
Add stock, bean paste, chilli flakes in oil, soy, vinegar and boil. Add tofu and simmer for 5 mins. Add corn starch mix and thicken. Add huajiao, green onion and chilli oil to garnish
9803 2018-04-03 01:42:20 I think they need to oil their sneakers.
9804 2018-04-03 01:42:09 They did lol not sunflower oil tho :( I need some for my face not to cook with
9805 2018-04-03 01:42:09 I think you mistakenly wrote the word “game”, when you meant to write “team”

9809 2018-04-03 01:41:16 Have we not learned that applying a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel turns into a 16 year, trillion dollar clusterfuck? Our only reasons in SRY is to cut off Iran's supply routes, snag some oil and establish a staging area for Iran / saudi /israeli showdown.
9810 2018-04-03 01:41:05 No boos in The X tonight. If there were, they would be for the Oil. Completely disengaged. Limbering up to hit the course.
9811 2018-04-03 01:40:59 I think this essential oil diffuser was one of the best purchases I’ve made, aside from my lemon and lavender sand&fog candle
9812 2018-04-03 01:40:54 Come on.  You’re smarter than this. Do you know about Scott Pruitt’s connections to big oil?
9813 2018-04-03 01:40:50 Jamaican Black Castor oil is really helping my hair though I feel it lol

9816 2018-04-03 01:40:24 Personally, I think the only answer to the war on terror is renewable energy. No oil $ Takes away the financing of terror & marginalizes the Middle East so we can pull our troops out with warnings: 1) Attack us and we’ll turn you into a parking lot. 1/2

9819 2018-04-03 01:40:16 This is absolutely insane! Funny how they are all for states' rights, until it affects their big oil donors' pocketbooks.
9820 2018-04-03 01:40:05 I’m laying edges 15 dollars a head, get at me for this Argan Oil Makeover b4 I raise the prices
9821 2018-04-03 01:40:05 It's time to demand action by the government of Canada to stop oil imports into Canada.   Destroying our country by depriving our own citizens of gainful employment is a shame.  Go Canada Go!
9822 2018-04-03 01:39:57 @RealDonaldTrump will make a lot of noise but is too scared to Fire Pruitt, because he doesn’t want to upset oil and gas folks. The weakest president in American history
9823 2018-04-03 01:39:41 I used to work for NOAA so....jargon is my second language. UMEs in the Gulf of Mexico were significant and of great concern after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. I appreciate your take on a broad array of topics. Fight on!
9824 2018-04-03 01:39:41 Good to see our neighbours in the US (Ogdensburg, NY) pay the equivalent of 67 cents per litre on average. It’s OUR oil but they are getting the discount. How does this make sense? STOP the over taxation!
9825 2018-04-03 01:39:38 As I was saying, shadows have been w/ me all my life & I dislike them sooooo much!
Once I get rid of this batch I won’t have an issue unless I forget to get the Cedar oil again ~ I put it on the soles of my feet to stop anything from attaching from the earth...
9826 2018-04-03 01:39:24 (2) I came home the next day to find my AR15 had intentionally overdosed on a bottle of Tylenol. I'll never forget seeing his lifeless body covered in gun oil from throwing up all over himself. He died on a Tuesday. I buried him under the tree out back.

9829 2018-04-03 01:38:52 My wife put peppermint oil on me for the first time today. All on the back of my neck and she just laughs at me when I ask if it’s supposed to burn. Smh. Is it supposed to?!? #peppermintOil #burn #burning #sensitive #skin
9830 2018-04-03 01:38:49 @SmartBalance Thank you for not using palm oil in your products. I just bought one of your olive oil vegan butter spreads today. Best wishes. :-)
9831 2018-04-03 01:38:43 I spent half the day thinking everyone was talking about the oil company...
9832 2018-04-03 01:38:26 Hey!! We aren’t behind the times. We are that progressive state that just legalized alcohol sales on Sunday. Oh and that CBD oil? What’s next? Fire works? But if your 8 years old we gotcha an AR when you’re ready. 
9833 2018-04-03 01:38:25 Finally running out of coconut oil 
9834 2018-04-03 01:38:18 if you want your car to permanently smell like a flower just spill a whole $10 bottle of orchid oil in it ;-)
9835 2018-04-03 01:38:08 hi,did you sell cbd oil or cbd vape pen?
9836 2018-04-03 01:37:49 I really hate having to wait 2 hours just to get my oil changed at Walmart when they are supposed to take like 30 minutes.
9837 2018-04-03 01:37:39 i love how excited people get when they walk by my essential oil diffuser at work. they’ll say, “smells like lemongrass today!” “ooo so calming! must be lavender!” while I just sit there + smile back because they are always wrong but the guessing makes them so happy
9838 2018-04-03 01:37:23 Tell me why this Audi requires MONTHLY OIL CHANGES THAT COST ME $100 EACH SKSKMWKEOAKfkdk

9840 2018-04-03 01:36:55 The article misrepresents with its headline, which makes it sound like the CT is so dramatic, it is causing prices to be exorbitant. That is not the case. 
The CT doesn't cut into my wages nearly as much as oil company gouging on long weekends and during Stampede.
9841 2018-04-03 01:36:47 After long weekend #Asian Indices commenced trade with RED following Wall Street Tech worries. 
#PBOC set the Yuan reference rate at 6.2833
Oil prices inched up as rising Russian output and expectations of a reduction in Saudi Arabian crude prices
9842 2018-04-03 01:36:40 Oh do share 

The plan that is?

Does that include short term energy self sufficiency for Canadians using safe pipelines to transport oil to a Canadian refinery system?

9846 2018-04-03 01:36:23 I thought John was arrested wasn’t he?  Something about Not disclosing 75,000 shares of Russian oil stock, Uranium 1 and some confusing thing about pizza and walnut sauce?  What is that?
9847 2018-04-03 01:36:20 Why should the USA export food & oil while citizens go hungry? Oil company & mega-farmers profits? BS!
9848 2018-04-03 01:36:04 For me if its more then 6 hours I have to get up. The pain & stiffness in my back is unbearable.  I move like Tin Man when I first get up.  I'm like need oil. lol
9849 2018-04-03 01:35:50 Aloe,  coconut oil.  I use both as aftershave.
9850 2018-04-03 01:35:41 Teddy Roosevelt did it. That’s why we don’t have Standard Oil. Or the other monopolies back in that time.
9851 2018-04-03 01:35:27 I asked my grandma what she wanted for her birthday and she said CBD oil 
9852 2018-04-03 01:35:11 Used to be ok back in the olden days before they all wanted the oil....
9853 2018-04-03 01:35:10 Just made my first batch of coconut oil chocolates!
9854 2018-04-03 01:35:08 Last summer, Total SA divested from politically uncertain AB Gay friendly Oilsands. June ‘17 Total SA invested $4.3B in more politically certain & economically certain IRAN. Pls don’t let Socialists tell you that Notley can’t help Oil Price. Notley is scaring investment from AB.
9855 2018-04-03 01:35:05 And the oil companies still get to keep their subsidies and tax breaks. Such a deal!
9856 2018-04-03 01:34:56 I got my oil changed today omg how much i needed that
9857 2018-04-03 01:34:44 hi,did u sell cbd oil or cbd vape?
9858 2018-04-03 01:34:42 So, when did you stop using oil?
9859 2018-04-03 01:34:26 The big oil firms have payed a lot of money to trump for this.
9860 2018-04-03 01:34:26 Dr Rocker added a liter of motor oil to his Audi’s brake fluid reservoir. His car is probably ruined. #sportscars #fuckingmoron
9861 2018-04-03 01:34:14 So many animals are on the brink of extinction and nobody is taking initiative, we protect oil more than our own beautiful creatures
9862 2018-04-03 01:34:03 I have used to do apple zucchini bread.  I used olive oil in it.   Was awesome
9863 2018-04-03 01:34:03 I poured too much lavender oil in the diffuser. #headache
9864 2018-04-03 01:33:15 Who is the Oil rich? That's who. Woooo.
9865 2018-04-03 01:33:12 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
9866 2018-04-03 01:32:59 did u sell hemp oil?

9868 2018-04-03 01:32:53 Smoke and mirrors, oil drunk Trump is getting ready to turn Alaska into an oil drilling wasteland. Now having open over 90% of Americas Coastal Waters for oil drilling. Lifts ban on hunting elephant and lion for trophy imports? Trump is turning America into a third world country!
9869 2018-04-03 01:32:41 I’m changing all of my patronage to Sinclair Oil.
9870 2018-04-03 01:32:32 at this point it’s considered fried and you’ll have to cut off the damage to let it heal!! u gotta space out ur bleachings babe & always use coconut oil during them
9871 2018-04-03 01:32:32 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
9872 2018-04-03 01:32:29 Did You know palm tree leaves with holy water or like a cleaning oil or something are good alternatives for Palo santo and sage , but the leaf has to be aged kind of
9873 2018-04-03 01:32:19 letting snake oil salesmen in hospitals seems like a far greater risk to me: plus it helps legitimise what is fundamentally a scam.
Bad spirits causing illness? Might as well let a Catholic priest in to "treat" cancer with holy water or do an exorcism.
9874 2018-04-03 01:32:16 I think it was mentioned on a DVD I once saw like 10 years ago with an illustrator who did oil paints. He gave a character the spikes on the cover of volume 1 of a book, then had problems posing the character when it was time to draw the cover for the sequel.
9875 2018-04-03 01:32:11 Toughen up and stop all aid to Mexico and put the marines on our border with Mexico . We can take over the Mexican oil fields and pay for our wall .

9880 2018-04-03 01:31:28 Or another person who has sued the EPA more than @EPAScottPruitt Pruitt screwed Oklahoma and cut and pasted oil industry lobbying statements in his support for the oil industry.
9881 2018-04-03 01:30:52 I think I’m high off peppermint oil and weed.
9882 2018-04-03 01:30:51 OK... I own stock in US based Oil Co. The Hess corporation. Does that make it Canadian Owned?
9883 2018-04-03 01:30:14 That’s odd. The Phillies manager is also a big proponent of coconut oil
9884 2018-04-03 01:30:13 hello would anyone happen to know if i still need oil to cook if i'm using a non-stick pan to make pancakes ouo;
9885 2018-04-03 01:29:57 You may be an oil field child if you hear an oil rig blew up and you IMMEDIATELY call your dad! Thank God it wasn’t my Daddy, and prayers for the ones hurt

9888 2018-04-03 01:28:40 wash hair less, COLD water only, dry it with a cotton t shirt instead of a towel, drink water constantly, biotin supplements, leave a deep penatrating oil (like coconut or avocado) in ur hair overnight with a few old t shirts around your pillow careful brushing. that’s what i do!
9889 2018-04-03 01:28:31 I'm still trying to put this together... Who, specifically, is financing this protest? Is it your contention that the US NGOs are not environmental groups at all, but a cabal of US Oil Co's concerned about a future trade deficit?
9890 2018-04-03 01:28:30 Why is the argument for harmful things like Fracking and Drilling Oil always that it creates more jobs? Like yes it creates jobs for people right now but you know it kills the earth so your grandchildren won’t even know what clean air is like. Why is it even an argument????
9891 2018-04-03 01:28:29 It depends on the specific strength of your oil:)
9892 2018-04-03 01:28:21 It's very similar to the way oil reserves waxes and wanes depending on how close we are to an #indyref
9893 2018-04-03 01:28:12 We got this at Westpoint, they wanted basically the price of a new bike for 'maintenance' and we were all lol no we'll just squirt it with some oil and keep on riding it until it falls apart, but thanx

9906 2018-04-03 01:25:58 Is that why we're subsidizing oil companies and low wage corporations with welfare? Also, just to be clear, who was the last president to actually do amnesty?

9921 2018-04-03 01:23:35 Brave Trump. Trying to confront China, Iran & North Korea at the same time. Any conflict will negatively impact Asia because:

1. Asia is dependent on trade
2. Asia will be the arena for 'wars'
3. Spike in oil prices can slow global demand & FDI in Asia.

9939 2018-04-03 01:19:39 Overnight -> Deep U.S. equity rout. The sentiment was rooted in familiar discussions - Trump trade threats, tech sector concerns, holiday illiquidity, modest global PMI pullbacks & oil pressure. S&P-500 -2.23%, Nasdaq -2.7%. VIX around 23.60. Gold back > $1340. #Nifty #Markets
9940 2018-04-03 01:19:36 There is a global oil surplus and deregulation will lower cost of manufacturing. You Dims don’t get it. Stop trying to regulate everything. Let the economy grow.

9945 2018-04-03 01:19:02 So your idea here is that people prohibited from owning firearms are legally allowed to own firearms because there isn't a law saying they have to give up the firearms they aren't legally allowed to own?

Seems like they're breaking the law by owning them. Yes or no?

9959 2018-04-03 01:16:16 Cumin Seed Oil has been called “The Remedy for Everything But Death.” That might be a bit of stretch, but with its skin healing, anti-inflammatory, and gut healing properties, it comes close!

10003 2018-04-03 01:10:05 I don't understand when the West is going to understand that the new warfare isnt conventional warfare.  They're distracting Trump with nukes and Putin with oil.  And then they're playing both sides against the middle while they posture and secure alliances. It's fucking scary...
