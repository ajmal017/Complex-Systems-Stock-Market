40 2019-02-06 23:45:14 Idk about the since GW thing? Trump did attack bump stocks like 2A says "shall not be infringed, unless it's a evil bump stock"? Pretty sure it doesn't say that.

But yes! He is up there with George Washington, Reagan and Coolidge. I'd say he makes the top 5

*Individuals choose funds based on how they're alphabetically ordered
*Stocks sold by fund managers outperform the replacement stocks they buy
#InvestorsNotActingRational

(We'll discuss both studies in the Mar AAII Journal)
91 2019-02-06 23:09:04 Tax reform?

You mean the tax reform that now sees the average dumbshit red state trump voter paying a minimum of $3k MORE in taxes, while companies dividend their enormous tax breaks to wealthy stockholders (most middle class don’t own any stocks) or use to buy back shares?
92 2019-02-06 23:08:58 Trump backed away from bumb stocks after the NRA told him no
93 2019-02-06 23:08:17 If you have access to stocks of tires, you can rot them by spilling oil, gasoline, caustic acid, or benzine on them. Synthetic rubber, however, is less susceptible to these chemicals.

95 2019-02-06 23:08:00 These stocks are pretty tiny.....I wouldn’t buy anything under 5 bucks .....by the end of 19 there may be 300 weed companies....not too many will make it

97 2019-02-06 23:05:23 With social security and/or pension you could put half in an annuity for lifetime income and invest the rest and have a worry-free retirement. Fisher wants to manage the whole amount and leach off of you for decades. He doesn’t even believe in bonds so he’d have you all in stocks
98 2019-02-06 23:05:14 Defense stocks were up today too after Trump announced the Arms Race is back on...
99 2019-02-06 23:04:19 Yes yes but imagine after the movie, he moves to penny stocks
100 2019-02-06 23:03:55 Buying stocks and making ratings are very independent of one another though. Of course there's uncertainty there because people don't want to lose their stock. There's no risk involved in just assigning the rating numbers.
101 2019-02-06 23:03:39 It actually is. Wall Street creates jobs, strengthens the economy, invests in programs and sustainability.

Wall Street was the first to divest stocks away and penalize gun manufacturers. 

Stop watching wolf on Wall Street and look into their global outreach programs.

104 2019-02-06 23:02:33 The DE you’re speaking of was towards the end of the season meaning there was plenty on winner equity at that point. There has certainly been mention of uncertainty in the buying of stocks.
105 2019-02-06 23:01:49 So great tweeter equals great politician? And anyone can speak their mind but there needs to be relevance in what they speak. You can disprove her comment within 1 sentence. Trump announced winner and stocks began a record setting  assent then democrats win the house stocks fall.
106 2019-02-06 23:01:04 I love how you guys promote a tweet about a pot stock, tell us to provide email address just to get name of the stock and now you want us to still give it to you because it dropped. I’ll just look at all pot stocks, see which tanked and buy...

113 2019-02-06 22:53:53 The Government/EU does not reduce quota/TAC for no reason at all.  They do it to protect at-risk stocks.  At-risk mostly due to overfishing.  Btw, angler numbers are estimated by Cefas.
114 2019-02-06 22:53:23 @CNBC @timseymour @MelissaLeeCNBC do you really think the WAY overused “burn”, “fire”, “smoke”, etc is funny or witty when discussing cannabis stocks? Let me help you: it’s not funny or witty; in fact it’s a beating.

117 2019-02-06 22:51:55 How EA fell when they have 1 of the most reputable brands in the industry. Proves stocks have very literal correlation with how strong the company is. Both of these companies are just an example of MM taking advantage of a little bad news to make a profit. System is broken 4 sho.
118 2019-02-06 22:51:19 Can you share your trading setup and how you selected stocks?
119 2019-02-06 22:51:17 No it is not require but if there is something to hide then hide it. If not why not let the American people see it. As for Congress Some of them do. Most make their money from lobbyists, stocks and other businesses they have. Like Kelly. He has an auto dealership, stocks, etc.

125 2019-02-06 22:49:09 Not much.  Do u lose your security of u lose ur keys? What if someone steals your ERC20 & sells it to someone else quickly?

216 2019-02-06 21:58:23 Loathed to engage in this dialogue but perhaps ask yourself why the quotas have been reduced continually over many years. Because of continual overfishing of stocks. The proportion of the TAC the UK received has stayed the same.
217 2019-02-06 21:58:16 To all the Bears I ask you this...with ALL the conditions in play similar to 1999.  For stocks to perform different you would literally have to believe "it's different this time".

220 2019-02-06 21:57:21 I just watched a video about programmatic advertising, and now I want to throw up. The ad tech market talks about advertising the same way as Wall Street talks about buying stocks. They simply don't care about the audience, the publishers, or anything. It's just about ads.
221 2019-02-06 21:56:47 Yep. And when the stockmarket tumbles, the rich buy up more stocks and wait till the shares go up again. They're happy every time he opens his mouth.

262 2019-02-06 21:36:36 5 years from now I’m emptying my stocks.
263 2019-02-06 21:35:53 The nearest store to you that stocks the item is the Rotherham extra. I understand that this can be a bit to travel. I've raised this with the relevant teams to see if we can get the item stocked in more stores but I wouldn't be able to promise that this will happen TY - Iona 2/2

271 2019-02-06 21:33:21 Basically what this chart tells me is that I should have bought stocks when I was born in 1983. Well, ALSO buy S&P and never sell. Why do we try to time this shit?
272 2019-02-06 21:32:16 It's a huge insurance scam whereost 'victims' are always insured by one company. Whenever biz is low, they remove some of the stocks then burn the premises. Police come & conclude that it was started by a faulty electricity.
'Victims' then get compensated & new structures are up
273 2019-02-06 21:31:56 both stocks did well today. there appears to be no end in sight with these 2 stocks.
$LCTZ and $SHMP are the big stories today. Lot of people are going to be talking about these 2 stocks. There is big money to be made here.

Their performance speaks for itself.
369 2019-02-06 20:40:56 True. I think much political backlash was because ETFs in heavy-buyback stocks did very well for years. That much is true, and suggests an inappropriate mechanism for juicing share prices -which arouses the ire of Democratic senators. Point is that that's not as clear as it looks
370 2019-02-06 20:40:53 But what about withdrawal or spending (buying stocks)?
371 2019-02-06 20:40:20 The S&P500 is trading like it took the red pill today, to be at 2731.0 (-0.26%).. Major movers AVGO +1.96% and GOOG -2.64%. What's brown and sticky? A stick. #badjokes #wishIhadbetterones #stocks

380 2019-02-06 20:37:12 I meant it to imply (as is the case), that high-buyback stocks had outperformed for a number of years and had ceased doing so. Using anthropomorphic language to describe market outcomes goes back at least as far as Ben Graham. Maybe it implies causality.

389 2019-02-06 20:32:18 Do you mean buy US stocks bc “best house in bad neighborhood” and powell put?
390 2019-02-06 20:32:18 How are Jill Stein's fossil fuel stocks doing these days!! Russian and European green party calls her a traitor to the Green cause of the world!!
391 2019-02-06 20:31:36 guys stocks are plummeting, no surprise with the current president
392 2019-02-06 20:31:15 Are you a holder of @Invacio Jon? Maybe we should ask William if we can get some #AIM #stocks on Agnes their #AI based financial projection platform.  It would probably improve my #trading!
393 2019-02-06 20:31:09 Once stocks get tokenized and decentralized exchanges are a thing probably not.
394 2019-02-06 20:30:12 To buy uranium mining stocks
395 2019-02-06 20:29:54 Stocks? Are those like, options that don't expire?
396 2019-02-06 20:29:23 No, it's not a trading app as advertised. You're not buying stocks, you're essentially betting on the stock value.
397 2019-02-06 20:28:55 true, because when the Fed announces it's dumping trillions in bonds on the market while also raising its key interest rate, basically it is telling investors to sell their stocks & buy up all the bonds it is dumping all at once on the market.
398 2019-02-06 20:28:55 I was once told when watching stocks move not to get caught up in the vortex of the intraday chart, use multiple frames times n u never surprised as to what's really going on #thestrat

401 2019-02-06 20:25:12 Stocks are risky.
I have invested almost 12K and the current price is 5K and it's been more than 1 year now so surely no stock market..  
402 2019-02-06 20:25:09 Yeah, but what would go up instead? Gold, stocks?
403 2019-02-06 20:24:31 DNA storage stocks?  Have any names?
404 2019-02-06 20:23:42 And I'm hoping that if you get the right stock, it be worth back time in ten years. So go look at Walmart stocks. If you bought hundreds of stock in 1980, it was worth about three bucks. Nowadays, it is worth almost a hundred. It's a long investment, but a good one.

408 2019-02-06 20:20:11 Just hopping in to clarify - stocks pay out dividends in UDS so we'll be giving you the dividend in USD to your Abra wallet. From there, you can either withdraw it directly (if possible) or convert to BTC and withdraw that way!

both blasting off into the close.
no stopping these 2 stocks.
412 2019-02-06 20:18:42 It's a proper penny stocks portfolio!! I'd be holding these sort of players with a long term strategy. If your looking to trade regularly then I'd buy G&A's and recycle every 30 days. The spreads are much smaller down market so it's less risky, hope it works out good luck bud 
413 2019-02-06 20:18:39 Nothing crazy but up .2% today. Green days are good days. #stocks #investments Hope everyone is having a green day in this red.
414 2019-02-06 20:15:28 Fair enough. I'm thinking of investing in stocks sometime next year. I got a large amount of cash in the banking account. Once I reach a certain goal, I will invest money into stocks. If you can find the right ones, you can have a good long term investment.
415 2019-02-06 20:15:12 Stip grand standing and think how they are only attacking one sector. Smsf. Thats unfair. Also consider how advisors have pushed investors into high franking stocks. Your analysis is too simple
416 2019-02-06 20:15:10 If your view is for 60-90 days then this is the best one. The other option is investing in stocks which I have also started doing for shorter term.
417 2019-02-06 20:14:39 It translates to (just buy stocks) 
418 2019-02-06 20:14:18 They are not supposed to say anything that might be construed as manipulating the price of stocks, that includes pretty much any announcement. Better to be safe than accidently earning a fine or end up in jail.

Why do you lie so much?
428 2019-02-06 20:11:55 Weird, Ds won’t condemn it. Why?
429 2019-02-06 20:11:04 I wonder, should you praise Trump?    He wants to start a new nuclear arms race.  He and Pence probably have stocks would do well in a proliferation.

465 2019-02-06 19:55:38 Right, but presumably "someone else" is this formulation is, like, Fidelity mutual funds, who will turn around and use that money to buy other stocks.

469 2019-02-06 19:53:44 Presumably most of that money flows to mutual funds and other money managers who have a mandate to use it to buy other stocks. What's the alternative theory, that investors see their XYZ stock is up one percent and go out and buy a yacht that they weren't going to otherwise?
470 2019-02-06 19:53:43 presumably the investors buy other stocks , but it could also be a ponzi scheme were the new companies use the cash they get to buy back the stocks of their other investors. (seems like tax arbitrage instead).

474 2019-02-06 19:51:49 I'm confident the FED will keep the bubble pumped up in stocks, print free money for banks, interest suppressed and decimate the middle class. Free markets are a joke, these are manipulated markets.

483 2019-02-06 19:48:48 What? We didn't earn ALL the money!? DUMP MY STOCKS! This company is doomed!
484 2019-02-06 19:48:35 Yes, it does. Taxing and regulating businesses forced them to sell stocks to shareholders and businesses so they can afford the tax on top of paying employees, mortgages, insurance, and inventory. Now businesses are forced to pay a tax, employees, and bankers. One must go.

487 2019-02-06 19:47:38 I retract my comment on your weaponry, you may well be fortified. I'd rather not engage in discussion of money, wealth and currency. I'm simply not interested. I will say, consider putting 10% of your assets in Gold stocks. You may be glad you did. Take care
488 2019-02-06 19:47:00 Last time I checked, Congress has to pass tax cuts and increases. Politicians are crooked. They exempted themselves from laws against insider trading and every time they get a briefing on stocks and bonds they all adjust their portfolios. Martha Stewart did time for less.
489 2019-02-06 19:46:55 Thanks. My gut never suffers. With all gold stocks, it can be a bit of a roulette wheel and can't sweat loses. Thanks ABX & NEM - major suckage.

491 2019-02-06 19:45:43 Because they have no clue how to take down the balance sheet without taking down stocks.
492 2019-02-06 19:45:23 Useless idiots. Assault weapons are you serious. Why should we ban adjustable stocks? Anyone care to take a stab at answering that.
493 2019-02-06 19:45:16 Depends. Generally that’s why you’d z score everything, to put it on the same scale. A 1 stdev move should in theory occur on average in the same amount of time for crypto, stocks, and fx. But what a 1 stdev move represents would be very different

524 2019-02-06 19:29:54 The S&P500 is trading in a laid back manner today, to be at 2730.0 (-0.29%). Hey @Carl_C_Icahn is this you doing the selling? #itsdownontheday #stocks

527 2019-02-06 19:27:30 Capitalism has nothing to do with taxpayer-funded healthcare.

Capitalists invest money in a business. Then they collect dividends. 85% of businesses fail but 10% go public &/or are profitable. Investors sell stocks when they're profitable.

You're welcome.

530 2019-02-06 19:27:16 Well to be fair, these numbers would look a lot different if they were taken from the same stage of growth. Amazon and others essentially took off on a similar type rocket ship. Not to mention stocks/commodities are inherently less risky, but no denying crypto’s gain potential.

532 2019-02-06 19:25:16 A little late to say "economic miracle" of course if you think the Dow hitting 25000 several time within 12 to 16 month is a miracle. Obama put the stocks in positive territory when he was elected and the gains continued you came into office,  stocks rose you dont get the credit
533 2019-02-06 19:24:55 My question is are regulators going to allow Abra users to trade stocks/etfs on top of BTC and LTC which require no KYC to deposit / withdrawal? Or is this going to be only available to KYC compliant customers?

- Invest in Traditional Assets like stocks & real estate
- If you aren’t considering crypto, you’re going to wish you did

594 2019-02-06 18:56:26 I have to say, those Canadian weed stocks seem to be doing quite well.
595 2019-02-06 18:56:19 For the BEARS:

Commercial stocks rose on the week by 1.3Mb an motor gasoline stocks by 0.5Mb.
Net imports fell by 863Kb/d or by over 6Mb – thus the build in commercial stocks on the week.
Gasoline demand fell by 491Kb/d as cold weather affected driving.
596 2019-02-06 18:56:00 I don’t invest in any stocks etc and I’m very happy. Just because you’re too lazy to make an honest living doesn’t mean the rest of the country is.
597 2019-02-06 18:55:51 For the BULLS:

Overall stocks fell by 3.4Mb as distillate fuel inventories fell by 2.3Mb. Cold weather helped demand for heating fuel.
Demand for all products consumed was up by 1.02Mb/d as distillate demand rose by 551Kb/d and propane use rose by 373Kb/d.
598 2019-02-06 18:55:04 But you want Russia to do a overall invasion in Ukraine? But of cause it is easy for you to say, you have no stocks in the conflict here such as family and so on. But will sit on the side line and have a wet dream of all the slaughter of innocent people. You sick fuck.

601 2019-02-06 18:52:50 Actually, this idea is fucking electric. Security tokens can be traded here, and stocks can be used to accumulate BTC (long and short). Gives a different value perspective. I also really like the idea of non-custodial securities. And 24 hour exchanges
602 2019-02-06 18:52:02 Yes, good reporting on a sophisticated scheme. "Pump and Dump": Buy stocks cheap, tout how great the company is while selling your own shares in the background.

621 2019-02-06 18:44:22 This is an idiotic, pedant point you are making. Top 0.1% owns as much as bottom 50% roughly. Most of that wealth is tied up in stocks or real estate. So yes is is immensely disproportionately owned by a tiny handful of people and to claim otherwise is to deny basic reality.

633 2019-02-06 18:38:46 Most stock is owned by the top 10%, but that still includes over 30 million people. There are only 540 billionaires in America. And even outside the 10% nearly half of the US owns stocks or is invested through other programs. So, no, the stock isn't "owned by billionaires".
634 2019-02-06 18:37:23 Everyone talks about changing the "culture" in Detroit. What is that? Is it just losing? Toughness? Being a pushover? Laughing stocks?

697 2019-02-06 18:08:28 The facts are Russia bought stock in a Canadian company that mines uranium.  They didn't get uranium out of the deal. The buy of the stocks had to be approved by a board of 9 people. But not one ounce of uranium left the mines on it's way to Russia.
698 2019-02-06 18:08:16 And poorly written tax laws that RAISE taxes on middle-class families. And ill-timed, unnecessary corporate tax cuts that are a bonanza to the wealthy who own lots of stocks but do nothing for middle-class families. In the long run, both policies will hurt.

Those things that do depreciate are 'things' like consumer manufactired goods. Investments like stocks, real estate and digital assets have appreciated in value.

756 2019-02-06 17:48:31 Correct me if I'm wrong but if you buy stocks through Abra, what you get are actually CFDs, not the stocks themselves. I think this is a nuance worth mentioning, even if leaves some scratching their heads.

766 2019-02-06 17:44:56 I can make $$$$$ elsewhere.  Why take unnecessary risks on SOL or APH or Auxley and all that crap.  Trade them.  Don't marry them.  Hold the solid companies with great corporate governance and lots of inside. These are not the only stocks on the universe. Nuff said.

826 2019-02-06 17:25:05 “Stop targeting law abiding citizens?” Why did the NRA request for the ATF to re-examine bump stocks? That led to Trump’s ban and confiscation of bump stocks from 400,000 “law abiding citizens,” and not a peep from the NRA about it. The NRA totally betrayed us!
827 2019-02-06 17:25:05 Yes, investment and interest are key. However it is still fairly risky, you've got to get fresh stocks, stable companies and it can lead to companies being pressured into making bad business choices. When it crashes it can crash big.

876 2019-02-06 17:04:43 Overvaluation is a weak argument to short. There's $280 trillion in debt. Rates are 2.5% in U.S. & 40% of government bonds in Europe are negative. Money is pouring into HYG and stocks for yield. There's no choice for fund managers but to accept risk. Even TSLA worked last year

895 2019-02-06 16:55:27 To be fair that statement is like saying stocks are a good investment. It’s a blanket statement. There are good & bad in both. You can lose & make money in both. It’s about the right choices and timing. Like all investments in life. People make & lose money on every asset class.

908 2019-02-06 16:52:04 I think this is referring to a value factor which is basically for stocks that don't trade in a crazy way (i.e. generate cash, low P/E, pay dividends, etc.).
909 2019-02-06 16:51:54 It’s not too much different than some current restrictions on corporations. In order to do certain things they must prove other things especially regarding taxes, stocks, mergers, acquisitions etc.
910 2019-02-06 16:51:16 Yes, I've been lucky enough to have locally caught wild sockeye salmon in British Columbia, it was unbelievable. Very interesting to see how they manage their wild stocks to maintain a viable fishery, instead of bowing to the farming industry.

945 2019-02-06 16:37:44 Trump's economy is a one-sided economy he doesn't care about jobs he cares about the stock market's value and people getting rich on the stock market when 88% of citizens in United States do not own stocks!! SO American workers wages have been stagnated since 1973!!!

Most of high drawdowns share shd come from smallcap highlighting probability of failure risk. Will plot sometime

976 2019-02-06 16:23:25 Strong USA employment is the major economic factor supporting the stock market rally.    I'm keeping an eye on the initial claims for unemployment, numbers on want ads, and announcements on layoffs.   If employment weakens, that would be horrible for stocks.

1061 2019-02-06 15:57:52 In long run equal weight beats market cap based but for shorter time when selected stocks moves that time market cap based beats equal weight , eg. Dsp equal nifty since inception given -5 % returns but market cap nifty50 return is 10+ %

1132 2019-02-06 15:33:16 Market timing is a myth in my opinion. It’s better to invest a set amount each payday in a broad market, low fee, mutual fund. One that mirrors the DJIA or S&P 500 is best. Another good option would be retirement age fund that mixes stocks with bonds.

1134 2019-02-06 15:33:07 The story of major oversupply (and massively disappointing sales numbers) is starting to emerge. 

Investors should use caution. I think these stocks will be down 70% within a year.
1135 2019-02-06 15:32:45 Rates can’t go higher doesn’t mean that they will go lower. $ will go higher due to multiple reasons. Therefore lower rates is a dominant trade regardless of where stocks go.

Online they seem to look either yellow or pinkish, (but not rose gold colour) can't find anyone on the high street that stocks anything but black. can you please advise what sort of 'gold' it is? Thanks

1153 2019-02-06 15:30:05 Yep tru that.  I had more losses than anything else last year by not taking profits when it ticked up by just 2 ticks.  I learned never fall in love with any penny stocks.  Take a profit when it moves. Simple as that.

1161 2019-02-06 15:26:43 Is it fair to state that typically on bear market Shortselling is the most profitable strategy and on bull market going long is..Just noticed that last year catalyst were very profitable to me..nowadays most stocks skyrocket during pre-market but get shorted 30 after market opens
1162 2019-02-06 15:26:20 I'm more interested in buying fractions of tokenized stocks, globally, 24/7
1163 2019-02-06 15:26:05 It'll create indirect ownership of stocks though. Still a huge step but seems like there's imperfections...also every crypto is leveraged against BTC and LTC correct? Brings no liquidity to anything else
1164 2019-02-06 15:25:33 @NetNinja normally i would agree.  But penny stocks have a good bit of speculation involved when or before a new product is released

1167 2019-02-06 15:24:02 At my age I’m a little upset I started late but have invested in stocks, looking for a house has been a bit of a process but I’m not here to live the present I’m here to secure my future 
1168 2019-02-06 15:24:02 What do you make of the recent divergence in index and broader market? Even though nifty is at 11k, several stocks are at 52 week lows.
1169 2019-02-06 15:24:01 I was naïve and chased the pot stocks back in 2015 during the first rally. At first I was holding the bag but I ignored most "experts" who were comparing pot to the dotcom bubble and i held patiently knowing that legalizing pot was the only promise Trudeau could actually keep.

1178 2019-02-06 15:21:18 Abra just announced that you can now invest in stocks, ETFs, and other cryptocurrencies all on top of the Bitcoin network.

No longer a question of “if,” but rather “when”

1180 2019-02-06 15:20:58 No, investments are high risk high reward. More likely to lose money than make it but taking the initiative and learning how to invest helps I think. I invested in penny stocks and lost everything, obviously I'm not wealthy material lol.
1181 2019-02-06 15:20:37 Pot stocks are getting slaughtered. Think I'm going to sit out today an watch how the afternoon goes.

1265 2019-02-06 14:55:28 @jimcramer It would be cool if you can compare the current stock market environment with the non recessionary 1998 "bear market", where you sold all your stocks that Karen Cramer bought back and rode the upward spike until you retired in 2000.

1275 2019-02-06 14:53:33 Beware of the costs:
For large-capitalisations and micro-capitalisation stocks, the most visible component of equity transaction costs - commissions - average only 17% of total costs @FI_InvestIndia @FundamentalGems @unseenvalue @Gautam__Baid @contrarianEPS
1276 2019-02-06 14:53:31 I’m just not an economic bear here I believe this cycle will last longer than people think because we been growing below trend for the whole time. 2% GDP next few years seems doable but yes comps high and stocks likely not offer 15%+ per year like we all used to

Most of the "money" in "circulation" isn't actually printed or in any form to CIRCULATE.  It's all in data in banks and stocks. Hyper-Inflation relies on too much being printed and thus devaluing itself. What we have now isn't good either.

1413 2019-02-06 14:11:56 I think the point is everyone knows it’s a mess and positioning/sentiment reflects it. look at Italian stocks since last week’s recession data and today. Up, even if no improvements on the ground (and btw I hope things do improve)
1414 2019-02-06 14:11:55 I think it’s too late too short now, at least for my risk appetite - but sure looks like all gaming stocks are a short now.. looking for a bounce around the 75 area, IF it happens, I will be riding it..

I have a couple of questions about this trend day identifying technique. 
1. What is the percentage of success in identifying the trend day? (Every method fails on someday in the market)
2. Can these indicators be used on stocks too to identify trend days?

1655 2019-02-06 12:04:36 I would guess through funds or inv trusts as the best option. You can trade some individual stocks, depending on platform you use, or via depository receipts on UK/US markets. AJ Bell offers a service but must be limited call 'cause only phone dealing and min £10k.

1664 2019-02-06 11:58:14 So manband20, r u that ignorant that you think Obama did something to create jobs? Obama himself said that manufacturing jobs were gone 4good.

1684 2019-02-06 11:39:01 I agree, they will. The price action on volume yesterday was very telling. There's a PR back in September showing convertible debt is gone, loan restructured to non-interest bearing and more the revenue jump. With patience $GMGI will roll.
1685 2019-02-06 11:38:07 Is it better to study 2 or 3 stocks Or go for all Nifty50?
1686 2019-02-06 11:36:33 Still stand by my thoughts. Good project and very decent reward on offer. Obvioulsy all mico caps carry risk. As for my personal investing strategy I've headed into tech and away from pre-revenue resource stocks for now.
1687 2019-02-06 11:35:21 Lmao! I'm sorry, this is dumb, she wouldnt need to receive or expect to if all her customers are financially stable, so expecting 10k from a govt is an economic policy? Really? So if she stocks up with 10k who eventually buys from her? This is funny...
1688 2019-02-06 11:33:52 Only 3 stocks can be looked in ADAG group for some gain..Reliance Nippon (up 20% today), Reliance Power (up 10%) and Reliance Home (down 10%).

1779 2019-02-06 10:11:41 Nifty Index is Expected To test the level of 11,200 In Near Term as the large-cap stocks are showing strength in the result season and on the other side traders are most active on the Call option of 11,200 level which shows the important resistance level for the Nifty.

1820 2019-02-06 09:38:02 U.K stocks have become some of the most shunned assets in the world. One big reason: Investors have lost faith that a weaker pound will lift shares if Brexit takes a turn for the worse. Investors have withdrawn money from UK equity funds for 10 consecutive months through December
1821 2019-02-06 09:37:26 This is a brutal market. Even if the earnings are stable the stocks are going to stumble steeply. Market spares only those companies where the management can be trusted and have shown clean corporate governance in the past
1822 2019-02-06 09:37:09 If none of those are meet, that is seen as a disapointment for shareholders, and then the stocks drop. Example: Tesla does not make a lot of money, but has a lot of potential. Coca Cola makes a lot of money, but they don't really have a lot of growth so not much is is happening
1823 2019-02-06 09:35:15 the mechanism includes free trade and access to the eu market,,, and beyond,,,, tariffs used in a correct manner are managing tools ,,ie high tarries on certain product to deter a demand, so stocks can grow,,, before we all starve
1824 2019-02-06 09:34:44 During the bear markets, stock prices reflect the pessimism of the crowd. In the bull markets, optimism is built into the prices of the stocks.

1859 2019-02-06 08:59:19 The things one looks for in stocks tell a lot about a person. On the other side, the ones I look to for advice are the ones open to looking at the perspective on the other endpoint, where the person who ultimately matters dwells. But keep on with the estimates, new bottoms I see.

1861 2019-02-06 08:58:58 Expert Advice- #Nifty has been moving in the upper end of the range and a positive breakout cannot be ruled out. However, it is best to see a close above 11000 psychological mark which will be first positive confirmation.

1864 2019-02-06 08:56:53 We are six weeks deep into a US stock market rally the likes of which we haven't seen since 1987. Since the lows of Christmas eve, the S&P 500 is up more than 16%.

Nearly 8% of that gain came in the month of January as investors bought 'oversold' stocks that were beaten down.

1885 2019-02-06 08:37:19 Markham usually stocks them, Mr. Price occasionally does
1886 2019-02-06 08:36:16 3 Reasons why I like Index Based Etfs as small retail investor 1) Stocks in the Index may come and go..2) weights of those stocks change based on performance etc..they stay till they perform else thrown out  3) Risk is well balanced..
1887 2019-02-06 08:35:28 #3IN it’s never wrong to take a profit and your profit was very good . I may in fact trim my holding but not yet as it looks to have more legs .  I was just wondering if you had any fixed plans for the cash as you and I hold a lot of similar stocks , ITs and Funds .
1888 2019-02-06 08:35:20 Markets won't reward popular beliefs.
Won't crash with Brexit,Trump,State Elections,Urjit,Auto.

Now Belief is to stay light ahead of ELECTIONS & do nothing in midcap and small cap anymore. I expect people to wait for elections and good midcap stocks to go up 50% in the meantime.
1889 2019-02-06 08:33:38 Banknifty lagging nifty. How long these few stocks gonna pull nifty.Broader market is still down. Any stock giving good results will see lot of inflow.

Thanks
1898 2019-02-06 08:26:38 Very aptly said , in my know how, very few stocks have created wealth by holding for the long term . A constant follow up and relooking of portfolio is a must !! Just buy and forget will never work for all stocks !

2000 2019-02-06 06:59:19 I think the tax cuts did help the economy. The unemployment rate went down and stocks went up as did $$ in our pay. But let’s just see what happens in 2019. We are late in the economic cycle and large companies used the tax credit to buy back stocks. 1/2
2001 2019-02-06 06:58:33 Public schools suck, the CIA & FBI are so corrupt they're worthless laughing stocks, and Medicare drives up the price of health care (just as govt backed student loans drove up tuition to obscene levels).

2011 2019-02-06 06:53:27 Matt- what does volatility represent? 
- unidirectional volatility suggests rapidly improving/worsening prospects
- ranged volatility could be either variance due to low volume or market pricing difficulty
I would argue stockpickers can only profit from higher volatility stocks

2096 2019-02-06 06:07:29 1. US stocks have  to go up.
2. Global interest rates are going lower.
3. If US rates go higher,  $ will go higher due to widening differential.
4. If $ goes higher, stocks will weaken, which is impossible due to 1.
5. Hence, US rates have to go lower.

2116 2019-02-06 05:50:03 You can tell they’re Russian because they have absolutely no facts. Regular Americans don’t benefit from stock buy backs because they don’t hold stocks?! I’m guessing they don’t know what’s in their 401k’s...

2126 2019-02-06 05:42:25 New post in Stock Phoenix: Rnam is up by 10 percent. Book profits. Call closed form our end. Two stocks SL got recoverd.
2127 2019-02-06 05:41:22 I closed up shop in 2010 as I was making a lot more money in Norfolk VA as a partner in a Electrical Contractors Business. My business partner was older and he started me out with stocks and I managed to buy some great stuff! Moved here in 2000 and I had to get a new license.
2128 2019-02-06 05:41:20 During the same time many small caps have risen multiple times.

Index has many stupid stocks....and cant be seen as the barometer!
2129 2019-02-06 05:41:02 New post in Stock Phoenix: We always says patience wins. Our three to four stocks hit the SL. thats fine and we said that we will recover.
2130 2019-02-06 05:40:28 Why are some black people always focus on Vanity things instead of investing in the future. Like real estate,stocks, passive residual income. I don't understand. You want to have the freshest and latest but have no emergency fund. No life insurance. We got to do better

2134 2019-02-06 05:39:25 What should do those who missed this rally sitting on the sidelines (majority missed it for different reasons)? Should they wait until stocks correct again before jumping in? In order words, if they were afraid to buy in early Jan, now they should be VERY afraid to buy, right?
2135 2019-02-06 05:39:06 Even with good results also stocks going down. Markets in full pessimistic way.
2136 2019-02-06 05:38:49 Nice to release these great looking kelpies to keep stocks up in this paradise
2137 2019-02-06 05:38:38 But Nifty is trading @ 11000. Still 50% of Stocks are at 52 Wk-L
2138 2019-02-06 05:38:22 High debt & high pledged stocks have been falling over past few days

Watch for banking stocks!!!
Banks could have a  tough time in recovering money?
2139 2019-02-06 05:38:04 And also I never get a lot of money but when buying stocks I just go with what I have even if it’s very little and invest it and save it up as well. And actually that’s what normal people actually do, it’s not big time jobs that gets them out of poverty it’s investing in stocks.
2140 2019-02-06 05:37:45 The sudden renaissance of the low rates narrative bodes also well for growth stocks whose investment rationale is built on lower discount rates....
2141 2019-02-06 05:37:12 In last one year on the NSE :

About 590 stocks of 1623 studied are down 50% or more (36%)
About 1097 stocks of 1623 studied are down 25% or more (68%)
About 1404 stocks are in the RED (87%)

#stateofthemarket #NSE
2142 2019-02-06 05:36:42 This is incorrect! As the UN @FAOfish report in SOFIA 2018, 66% of stocks are fished to the maximum sustainable levels or less, and 33% of stocks are overfished. 

They state: DO NOT group the categories “maximally sustainably fished” and “overfished”.

2180 2019-02-06 05:15:39 capital flows in 4 cycles :
stocks, commodities, $, bonds ... stocks ...

Next move will vacuum capital from all stocks and place them to bonds as US10Y = 3.00% and rate cuts will just make bonds 100x more attractive than P/E=100 or Shiller P/E=30 stocks for a fast return.
2181 2019-02-06 05:15:25 Yes, The theme of this year seems to be 'Corp. Governance Awakening'.

2186 2019-02-06 05:12:30 Pumped stocks entering a disproportionate bearish zone.  Last time was 17 months ago, which lead to rampaging double tops.
2187 2019-02-06 05:11:42 But as much I as hate being on that, I have also started doing things that are smart with my money and also buying stocks as well. Which is also separates me cause I’m starting to save parts of my money as well.

2200 2019-02-06 05:05:09 This rally above 11k is a 3rd class rally which should not be celebrated.apart from 5 to 10 stocks,most of them have collapsed. I would call this rally a shameless rally.
2201 2019-02-06 05:05:03 Congrats on the bonus, most workers did not receive one. Have you done your taxes yet? Hope you enjoy paying for the tax break the GOP gave to the fat cats, who mostly spent it buying back company stocks that will further line their pockets.

2215 2019-02-06 04:58:25 Invest a little into different stocks . Play with them and find out the consistency of them.
2216 2019-02-06 04:58:08 Last 2 year the rally has been oncenctrated with most individual stocks loosing ground.......3 year return is never a good idea to look at.......look at 10 year return....as an entire cycle plays out.....

2218 2019-02-06 04:57:40 Choosing a set of stocks and hoping they'll match or beat the market is like trying to hand-optimise code without profiling. You risk spending a bunch of time and effort without any benefit.

Indexing is like -O3. It's a good generic choice.

2238 2019-02-06 04:46:59 I'm in the process of reworking how I use 3 purples to make it the most soul crushing experience to play vs. It's not about taking the stocks anymore, it's about making you want to quit playing the game.

2257 2019-02-06 04:38:49 also the slow increase started in the last two years of OBAMA’S presidency. 2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade and again, the growth mostly benefitted the wealthiest becuase of tax cuts that we have to make up for in the future.

2266 2019-02-06 04:34:01 You're lying your ass off now. Stocks dont belong to the American people they belong to wallstreet bankers and share holders and hedge fund billionaires - not the average American if you bothered to look at your taxes. Once again, conflating the few with the majority.
2267 2019-02-06 04:33:51 I think the psychology of NIFTY being above the crucial 11k level may provide some bounce to some quality beaten down mid-cap stocks ... somehow #Nifty levels & general stock price levels are not in sync & the debate will only increase now. #sensex
2268 2019-02-06 04:33:00 I was just making a point that choosing a stock for me is easier than a MF. Because i have to pick a fund house, fund manager and then see if he is picking the right stocks or there is minimum style drift. So easier and profitable to index. Stock example ignore

2273 2019-02-06 04:30:50 A few things stood out during the State of the Union:

1. Lower drug/insurance prices (biotech, pharma & insurance stocks may continue to sell off)
2. China trade agreement needs to have "structural change" & Reciprocal Trade Act (i.e. trade war). Could stall rally/spook markets
2274 2019-02-06 04:30:46 NIFTY VIEW -FINALLY NIFTY HAS BROKEN 3 MONTH OF CONSOLIDATION& TAKEN OUT 10985 RESISTANCE. IF WE CAN CLOSE ABOVE THIS LEVEL NEXT TARGET COULD BE 11200..

2279 2019-02-06 04:28:56 What should you do to be a successful investor. Follow one investment framework at a time. Don't mix portfolio with different stocks which are based on different frameworks. Following a single investing framework will help you in monitoring your portfolio precisely.#StockMarket

2284 2019-02-06 04:24:09 I'm looking for a metaphor to explain to programmers why index funds are superior to owning individual stocks. So far I've come up with:

Index funds are like unit testing, on average it's better for most of your code/portfolio to have tests/be in an index.

2287 2019-02-06 04:22:26 Remember, if markets close above 11070 on a closing basis, then this will surprise everyone on upside !! Every TV Guru's are saying this is weak and only few stocks are participating ....but lets not bother ...we follow charts and make money on upside and downside

2291 2019-02-06 04:19:37 It’s costing significantly less than $5bn because pensioners will stop investing in stocks for dividend payments and will invest in growth stocks or alternatives such as Term Deposits. The industry will restructure for the legislation change.

2293 2019-02-06 04:18:50 Yes, the price target is mostly always considered based on a years time frame. Penny stocks usually have ridiculous ones because they’re so volatile and sometimes they’re put out at the beginning of the year when a stock could be 100% higher than its current price.

2357 2019-02-06 03:44:09 Do you drink like this when you're doing technical analysis of stocks, too ?
2358 2019-02-06 03:43:43 Job numbers and the stock market are not accurate barometers of how well our economy is doing or, for that matter, our society. People are “employed” if they’re working three minimum wage jobs to try to make ends meet. Stocks go up in a rigged system.

2363 2019-02-06 03:40:49 Portfolio against a stock ..it is not really about returns. Imo we need a portfolio to avoid concentrated risks. Individual stocks require high level mental strength.  a portfolio or a fund manager (who gives better risk adjusted returns ) can give  better Sharpe ratios

2365 2019-02-06 03:39:06 I can't believe stocks stayed flat throughout
2366 2019-02-06 03:39:04 NZ is a small market with limited growth potential. Overseas markets get most NZ fish. 
The point of QMS is to manage the fish stocks, so obviously you can't allow large scale fishing outside that. The difficulty is fish aren't caught in proportion to how much quota you own.
2367 2019-02-06 03:36:31 The problem is buybacks just mean someone is buying a lot of stocks. That increases the price but at the next crisis or earlier people look at the fundamentals and see that the stock is overvalued. So the money goes to the one's who sell high - usually institutional investors

 #TradersDoItSitting
2372 2019-02-06 03:33:13 I actually enjoy this phase more than the initial phase. However, my strategy during bull phases remains the same: chase gappers and stocks in play. There will be a lot of those in the days to come. However, there are some cloud stocks that I consider holding longer-term.
2373 2019-02-06 03:32:48 lol pull out your stocks if you think we’re currently so successful. it’s not like people have lost hundreds of thousands in the market recently since trump said he would put a higher tax on imported goods. but no... it’s dems ruining EVERYTHING ur so right man!

2392 2019-02-06 03:23:22 New threat to stocks is Rating agency Activism. Good for long term but ads to volatility in short term.
2393 2019-02-06 03:22:23 Ohk sir. Was just curious to know if it was daily close since many stocks are hitting more than 20% on daily basis and it may go down real quick on Monthly close
2394 2019-02-06 03:22:03 yeah, I OWN STOCKS! said in the same tone as "Im on a boat!" lol. I highly just recommend getting the free stock, selling it, deposit the money into your account, delete the app lol.
2395 2019-02-06 03:20:54 Mans said he invests in stocks, uses Robin Hood 
2396 2019-02-06 03:20:42 So you do have a pension, which you get tax free relief on. Nice work , and no doubt your pension is invested in stocks that actually avoid tax. We are all part of this issue
2397 2019-02-06 03:20:00 I almost bet he mentions stocks and witch hunt first
2398 2019-02-06 03:18:29 if you know anything at all about stocks, you know that the stock market is NOT the economy....jesus. ...
2399 2019-02-06 03:17:50 Thank you, Dragon Stocks. I think I communicated it clearly in my email and twitter on who will get affected with the new prices. All good!
2400 2019-02-06 03:16:12 People bought stocks in 1999 because they were fleeing everything else.  It wasn't a "value" based investment, or an optimistic belief in the U.S economy.  They just heard day after day it keep rising.  Word of mouth spread and boom...took off like a rocket ship.

2407 2019-02-06 03:13:31 We'll watch pharma stocks for you tomorrow after @realDonaldTrump just said they need to bring down drug prices. So far, many have ignored his demands and have *hiked* prices. If those stocks falter, it may mean investors believe pharma will be forced to bend. #SOTU
2408 2019-02-06 03:12:59 I think most of us would be satisfied with public humiliation for those bankers, say an hour or so in the stocks in Martin Place, before heading to court with Legal Aid representation because their proceeds of crime were frozen.

2411 2019-02-06 03:12:11 At the end of a cycle people could care less about profit and earnings.  You think people cared about earnings in 1999...lol.  People chase stocks in the end simply because they go up every single day almost.  I think we are gonna hit 38,000 on the Dow.

2425 2019-02-06 03:07:14 Finding a multibagger is difficult because most people try to find it at the tip of bull market looking retrospectively to stocks which are already multibaggers. The best time to find any such idea is the bear market when pessimism is around good businesses.
2426 2019-02-06 03:06:24 And if you were a European who bought dollars exactly one year ago and put your money into an index fund you would be up 9%. So stocks are not in a bear market for all of Europe.

2431 2019-02-06 03:04:32 When did I ask that they shouldn't save anywhere else? Why is owning some share in your company equivalent to having no other savings in your opinion? Either way, the rich hold a lot of their savings in their own stocks, and it has worked out pretty well so far.
2432 2019-02-06 03:04:10 Now as stocks rise that is gonna feed on itself and more and more people will pour into the last major bull market on earth.

2436 2019-02-06 03:03:07 So the foreign capital started flooding into bonds and gold.  When Powell raised rates in Dec it turned into a flood and hedge funds blew up just like 1998.  Pension funds tipped the scales with the PPT and shorts covered and about mid January stocks won the battle over bonds.
2437 2019-02-06 03:01:57 But also believe me I still have impression FED can kick the can and create some vacuum. Economy down-turn = BULLISH for stocks... Why? Well just because ... My investment cycle tells me. Get out of stock market with physical cash and gold what I did ...

2477 2019-02-06 02:50:53 this dude @desmondhaymon25 is into investing stocks now lmao
2478 2019-02-06 02:49:52 I am also for the ban of assault type weapons. And I was for the ban of bump stocks which happened and I am against the NRA SO DONT @ ME
2479 2019-02-06 02:49:34 1994 = 2015 not 
1998 = 2018
2020 = looks like the peak in u.s stocks then gold will hit a secular low and begin a new bull market.
2480 2019-02-06 02:49:01 What do you say to either friends or family whose "investment" stocks have eroded in value by 80% & seeking your advice..To even get to break even, it has to move by 300-400%...good company or bad company, the only fact is price....too late to get out or save whatever you can??
2481 2019-02-06 02:48:34 So you are saying don't be loading up on most retail stocks?
2482 2019-02-06 02:48:03 Perfect! Most securities (stocks, bonds, commodities, options, etc) trade on an exchange. The main one is the NY Stock Exchange (NYSE). There are thousands of stocks on the NYSE which makes it very difficult to track the market’s performance. Enter the benchmark indices.
2483 2019-02-06 02:47:18 This last fall a huge amount of hedge funds blew up just like 1998.  Russia defaulted etc.  So oil fell as the dollar rose and stocks to off for one final #meltup.
2484 2019-02-06 02:47:16 I mean us together can file a shareholders petition to $LPTX mgmt to stop diluting our common stocks instead of sitting on a bench all day watch it fall
2485 2019-02-06 02:46:28 “The best pot stocks to buy”
2486 2019-02-06 02:46:25 I don't get it either. stocks have been divorced from reality for some time
2487 2019-02-06 02:46:21 Have a few positions in leading CAN SLIM stocks, and see lots of stocks breaking out: My task is now is to sit on my hands, and resist any temptation to do "something" other than to cut-loss if any of my stock goes  down 7%.
2488 2019-02-06 02:46:11 There are better alternatives than knowingly  buying over valued stocks. Being in cash or cash equivalent for instance
2489 2019-02-06 02:45:48 It's a prospective, even people who made loads of profits out there has never saw Charts of any commodity, coins or stocks, So somewhere TA on anything is pointless , and TA is  worthy on anything if it can help you Trade your next position & make you some $$. It's Simple
2490 2019-02-06 02:44:52 Where is Mr. Grossman? You should be there and shout out what about bump stocks
2491 2019-02-06 02:44:31 Closer home. Tech boom when quality stocks like INFY Wipro, were crushed with the K-10 stocks. In 2008 LT,  RELIANCE were crushed with other INFRASTRUCTURE stocks
2492 2019-02-06 02:44:29 COLONIAL SOCIETY stocks rallying
2493 2019-02-06 02:44:18 Didn’t he ban bump stocks
2494 2019-02-06 02:44:15 but lets start with banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines and the "assault" type rifles.
2495 2019-02-06 02:44:02 Learning:
A/C:
Buy it in winter. 
Use it in summer.
Stocks:
Buy when others are in panic
Sell when there is greed.
PS: Don't buy in moderate panic and sell when the panic peaks 
2496 2019-02-06 02:43:52 You do know that gun laws have been passed? You do know that bump stocks are now illegal right? Wheres the media on that?
2497 2019-02-06 02:43:12 indeed. many repurchased stocks & are closing plants.
2498 2019-02-06 02:42:59 Look at what happened in 1994 that was the peak of the emerging markets for that cycle.  Tech stocks got crushed that year and there was a ton of volatility even in the bond market.  #tequilacrisis for the next 3 years stocks rose and then emerging markets blew up. #ltcm
2499 2019-02-06 02:42:55 How about getting rid of a bump stocks RK 15th for the love of the people whose families were lost in mass murders.
2500 2019-02-06 02:42:28 That's because this is relative to the state of the economy when they were inaugurated, thus meaning that those that inherited a stronger economy will have a worse "performance" compared to those that didn't. Admitting Trump has done well in terms of the stocks won't hurt you lol
2501 2019-02-06 02:41:59 Imagine if Trump cared this much about victims when a white dude with bump stocks killed 59 folks in Las Vegas.
2502 2019-02-06 02:40:46 Trump and that little nazi-puke Stephen Miller ought to be stoned in stocks.
2503 2019-02-06 02:40:02 If that's so why are so many of us getting hit with tax bills we have never had before? No pay increases no 401's no stocks or anything like that.

2511 2019-02-06 02:36:01 Bro - not all salary is to be paid in stocks. Mostly cash, and some stock with the cash:stock ratio varying with position. If the business goes bust, junior employees suffer anyway - whether they own stocks or not.

2523 2019-02-06 02:27:36 Bottom guys get salary which they then invest in stocks anyway. I don't think there is any reason to prefer all cash. If all employees were shareholders, wealth maximization won't hurt anyone.

2571 2019-02-06 01:57:49 Risk is associated with products (like mutual funds, stocks, bonds, etc.), so that doesn't apply to RRSPs and TFSAs. TFSAs definitely have fewer restrictions, though! #RRSPandTFSAReady

2594 2019-02-06 01:45:46 The problem isn't the mechanism itself, it's how people use it. In theory, buybacks should be better than dividends due to taxes. In practice, most ppl just suck at timing stocks or they do buybacks for the wrong reasons, so buybacks probably end up being worse.
2595 2019-02-06 01:44:56 Arguably the two most important things to keep in mind when investing: keep costs down, and pick a proper investment mix (stocks/bonds). These two will improve your rate of return over the long term. #RRSPandTFSAReady

That's why I trade only in NIFTY
2607 2019-02-06 01:35:35 President Trump is great ask anyone who has stocks in their retirement fund
2608 2019-02-06 01:35:25 I’m a sell side E&P assoc analyst and the first thing I learned was capex and oil production moved stocks (for oil names). Gas names total equivalent production just matters. For hedge funds they look at exit rate prod, FCF generation, & well results. Great advice @millermusing

2610 2019-02-06 01:35:11 If the American people & the press relied on "facts" like they did pre-President Trump it would be pretty quiet. The economy is bad, jobs are bad, stocks are bad, the world is bad. Now Ivanka is bad...go figure. Now I know why it's called "fake news" & stupid people follow it!
2611 2019-02-06 01:35:02 I do not because I am unsure and do not know much about stocks and bonds and the markets. #RRSPandTFSAReady
2612 2019-02-06 01:34:36 @IvankaTrump Don’t forget that a lot of jobs don’t come w/ benefits (med/dental/vis) Do you think it’s right that the rich & corps got a huge tax break, CEOs gave themselves a 30% raise, bought back stocks and employees got a 1x bonus OR nothing? A 3% raise is NADA next to 30%
2613 2019-02-06 01:33:20 Also, most Asian market rises much from its low, why not considering US S&P 500 rally as strength it constituent of 500 stocks
2614 2019-02-06 01:33:13 @LanchesterWines Hope you have got stocks of Unruly Red for “Independent Drinks Retailer of 2019” Will ring you tomorrow.
2615 2019-02-06 01:32:20 Zion with his 4th straight game with 5+ stocks, his defensive potential seems to not be talked about enough
2616 2019-02-06 01:31:44 I prefer to imagine that real Muskbros have about 10 followers in real life too...but yeah, might not just be him astroturfing, but other pumpers gotta pump penny stocks like $TSLA too. A dollar is on the AI team reassigned from FSD to creating bots and trading systems.
2617 2019-02-06 01:31:18 Last week I over traded so this week NOCANDO #STOCKS #stockmarket
2618 2019-02-06 01:31:07 Best way I've found to teach stock picking is take top 10-20 co's in your industry, pull last 5 years investor pres, read em oldest to newest, make stock prediction after each one, then check results, You'll learn what moves stocks. Then go read most recent for rest of the sector
2619 2019-02-06 01:30:43 Not sure if anyone could beat non-finance Charles A. at trading stocks.
2620 2019-02-06 01:29:33 hard to believe the way these maggots still support and own
fossil fuel stocks
2621 2019-02-06 01:28:43 Already trump is indicating that this may become a rally and not so much too bring the country together.  Heck, isn't he the one who who created the divide?
People are working 2 and 3 jobs to fill the job market! Tax breaks for the wealthy!
Stocks are in turmoil! Inconsistent!
2622 2019-02-06 01:27:45 Now is a good time to invest in ammunition manufactures. When the liberals do stupid things like this, everyone I know stocks up.
2623 2019-02-06 01:27:45 expect it when everyone least expects it. SO many overbought stocks and es about ton touch the 200DMA the game is about to roll over. Just a little bad news will go along way.
2624 2019-02-06 01:27:40 Bernie Trivia - Which Potus Banned Bump-Stocks ?
2625 2019-02-06 01:26:49 Years ago you broke out Disney's worth by segment. At the time the value of the company was double what the stock was selling for. How does Disney receive it's true value. John Malone has no problem breaking up his companies into individual stocks? Why not Disney?
2626 2019-02-06 01:26:43  the book and am down for adopting “zucked” colloquially

Facebook’s business model is premised on zucking your data for profit.

Facebook caught zucking minors PII again.

FB stocks tank on passage of Rep Lieu’s sweeping privacy legislation aimed to end zucking.

2627 2019-02-06 01:26:34 I watched ignorant investors lose tens of thousands of dollars and some of them...their life savings in $CEI, $HSGX, and $IGCC because they didn't want to take a loss before those stocks imploded or reverse splitted. There is nothing wrong with making a dumb trade but gtfo quick
2628 2019-02-06 01:22:04 So everyone has to shut down their online brokerage accounts for stocks, bonds, options, forex, etc then?
2629 2019-02-06 01:21:51 Sort of but it means different things to different people I try to actively put funds towards my retirement #RRSPandTFSAReady I am not aggressive with stocks.
2630 2019-02-06 01:20:33 I don't know which was true: disinformation created this delusional optimism to prop up stocks or the msm ppl who wrote articles were plain stupid?
2631 2019-02-06 01:19:25 I made 10 dollars in a week on stocks . Let me get y’all hip mane 
2632 2019-02-06 01:19:20 Damn it! I knew it! I KNEW Vince was playing around with cloning. That is why he cashed in a bunch of his stocks awhile back.
2633 2019-02-06 01:17:36 It's not only skipper but many mid and small cap cos. have lost their way post demonetisation. Mostly all of them hovering and creating new lows regularly. I am not a qualified analyst but I can say that stocks showing one way downtrend must be kept for shorting not investment.
2634 2019-02-06 01:17:07 UFC stocks have dropped dramatically since the departure of lord artem
2635 2019-02-06 01:16:26 @kjthegamballer  KJ it’s crazy cause I been winning more with sports bets than with stocks and forex from a percentage stand point of things. And I guess I always thought it should be easier with equities to make money but I should just follow my gut and put the money there.
2636 2019-02-06 01:13:33 Honestly you have a legitimate point, problem is nobodies fucking braindead enough for me to abuse in this game. If taking stocks is hard for me as Lucina, i'm pretty sure you could give fox lasers falcon punch KB and i'd still manage to let people live to 200
2637 2019-02-06 01:12:41 ack ggs @2Scoops_Nicko if that was you on quickplay just now.  i need to stop getting tilted by bad lost stocks, i got mad flustered after that first one in the 2nd game
2638 2019-02-06 01:12:40 Bullish: Internet security stocks, Bearish: Hot stocks.
2639 2019-02-06 01:11:31 a1. Yes I do. Stocks and ETFs in both #RRSPandTFSAReady

2643 2019-02-06 01:10:07 Your making over 10 million dollars which is where the top rate of 70% would kick in? If so you should be paying more. Plus as you know income off stocks are taxed at a lower rate than normal income.
2644 2019-02-06 01:08:56  if this is true, we all need to research what stocks help twatter, and boycott ANYTHING produced/sold by those companies that give to twatter!

2647 2019-02-06 01:07:05 Assuming you believe 1 of 2 things: stocks go up and down or you are investing to make money to buy other things, then you are going to sell the stock at some point to either protect your gain or to buy something. You pay taxes on the gain. But, maybe they don't own any stocks.
2648 2019-02-06 01:06:19 Don't tell me, more tax cuts so that corporations can buyback more of their stocks resulting in less revenue for all the fixing that this country needs. #TaxScam
2649 2019-02-06 01:05:50 @quakes99 Hi John, if I may ask, wharare your top picks for  uranium stocks ? I've researched into bnm, dyl and already own pdn and uuuu.

2653 2019-02-06 01:04:48 Sir any stocks we can look into
2654 2019-02-06 01:02:43 Argument goes - top guys can change the decision of the company. 

Bottom guys can’t and would prefer cash instead. 

Another thing - top management should be paid in stocks and bonds in same ratio as a companies capital structure. 
Highly levered firms stock is call option
2655 2019-02-06 01:02:34 Wild are holding stocks - 2nd penalty in a row where theyckamped down on Sabres sticks
2656 2019-02-06 01:01:07 Stocks are overpriced
2657 2019-02-06 01:00:21 When gaming stocks goes down, Chip stocks goes up. Plus nxpi and mchp ER will hold chip stocks up. Plus intel is breaking out. Plus china market is closed.
2658 2019-02-06 01:00:14 Go exempt, but save the money and invest it in stocks. When taxes come around you’ll be able to pay that bill and have some left over.
2659 2019-02-06 00:58:36 I learnda...lot 
2660 2019-02-06 00:58:09 Ok and now I’m standing in the lobby of Whitman and it’s pretty silent and this guy walks through practically YELLING on the phone talking about how “weed stocks are basically their own market” I have had such a strange day
2661 2019-02-06 00:58:03 If I didn’t know better I’d swear these libtard politicians have a lot of stocks in gun & ammo manufacturers, stocks and dividends are going up, nice to be privileged to insider trading
2662 2019-02-06 00:57:53 Well, it's important to note that GICs are fixed-income deposit products, whereas mutual funds cover everything - fixed income (bonds), equities (stocks), real estate, etc. So it's not a direct comparison. #RRSPandTFSAReady
2663 2019-02-06 00:57:41 In the Tech Wreck banks were fine... their stocks not so much.. $JPM stock was down more peak to trough than in the GFC.  That recession was longer & shallower than the GFC.
2664 2019-02-06 00:57:36 That said I don’t necessarily think the jurisdiction thing is right. Like shorting stocks, buybacks are somehow distasteful because they evoke recent financial trends (leveraged recaps, etc), as per Levine’s other argument
2665 2019-02-06 00:57:35 Cyr c'est un mec bizarre il fav des photos de mecs stocks 
2666 2019-02-06 00:56:19 So no pot stocks
2667 2019-02-06 00:56:17 Oh yeah, I forgot that they expire. Would make sense for new stocks of movies to just change over that way. Thanks man.
2668 2019-02-06 00:55:18 Y'all like losing stocks at 0%?
2669 2019-02-06 00:53:46 @ChennaiAirport Curry Kitchen at the Domestic terminal stocks only 750 ml water bottles, smaller bottles aren’t available. More plastic pollution and wastage of precious water.
2670 2019-02-06 00:53:37 Alas, though. Stocks are part of the employees' compensation...
2671 2019-02-06 00:52:39 Woah.  Great news for #Lomiko and #graphite #stocks
2672 2019-02-06 00:50:16 Defund that DC "art" company.  That is targeted harassment similar to the stocks in Williamsburg.
2673 2019-02-06 00:49:21 Just made $300 half an hour after waking up, man y’all gotta give stocks a look lol
2674 2019-02-06 00:48:20 Also Sam on news quiker than Dion Sanders. And can tell you what is going to move stocks. Sam said last night GOOGLshe be up great earnings. Said at 6.55 Googl would go Green Sam is the GREATEST.
2675 2019-02-06 00:47:31 Are 'Pink' sheet stocks risky? This stock has been crushed $AACPY. Took a flyer on them as a possible takeover target. Chart looks bad as they look like they have a long way to go to recover share price.
2676 2019-02-06 00:47:22 $SNAP this is crazy stocks up huge after hours even after fighting off bears shorting. They say shorters lost 166 million today lol
2677 2019-02-06 00:46:24 I'm suggesting that stocks acquired aren't simply retired, they are kept to be re-issued. Retired stock would in theory equally change the price (but it doesn't). Treasury stock can be re-sold, right? A dividend is cash straight out the door, you'd need to issue new stock.
2678 2019-02-06 00:44:40 I be seeing who invested in stocks on the Democratic side of their suggestion on border control!! They can turn a profit on bricks and mortar!!
2679 2019-02-06 00:44:36 Con los stocks que van a estar manejando se ve difícil, ¿no? Aunque la CC tenga un respiro...
2680 2019-02-06 00:44:29 Hey Patrick. Just missed that strong move off the Christmas eve bottom with so many stocks. $HRS is one of my favorite companies. Innovative to be sure. Do you think it will make a top this year?
2681 2019-02-06 00:44:04 I hope you are right. I am a bit afraid made money on stocks!
2682 2019-02-06 00:41:40 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
2683 2019-02-06 00:41:33 Stocks, come and go, but the one constant that has existed in the past and will continue to exist is human emotion. Fear and greed, I’m sorry to say will never change.
2684 2019-02-06 00:41:09 The problem is that many stocks are in bubble valuation.  So right now, most companies should be paying a dividend instead of doing a buy back.
2685 2019-02-06 00:39:21 It’s not looking good for Australians wanting to trust their financial institutions. This #BankingRC needed teeth... the bank stocks rising post the final report and recommendations gives real reason for concern. #auspol #wtaf
2686 2019-02-06 00:37:43 For most OTC stocks? Yes but that's because the OTC is a sea of shell companies and incompetent snake oil salesman CEOs. Most of these guys are clowns and know nothing about marketing or building a proper brand. I'm learning to treat OTC stocks like prostitutes.
2687 2019-02-06 00:36:54 As far as daytrading goes - Anyone feel that some stocks just work better for you?
In my case - $NFLX $INTC $AMZN $KHB $BAC
Always have bad luck with - $NVDA $FB $AMD
2688 2019-02-06 00:35:42 I want to say thank you @timothysykes @StocksToTrade @profitly for all your lessons you have make me so grow up in few months

2692 2019-02-06 00:31:21 @MegaManSSBU This may sound dumb but how are you guys closing out stocks? Now that macro cancel metal blade throw to Bair is gone, I'm really struggling to kill.
2693 2019-02-06 00:29:21 That's true don't be the first on a penny stocks that you think winner just fallow the wave at the good time... 
Lets make media Twitter Facebook NASDAQ or other sell for you the best penny stock to investigate andnmake money
2694 2019-02-06 00:28:53 Under President @realDonaldTrump: 
-The economy grew at its fastest rate in 13 years
-Job creation has been strong by any metric
-Wage growth is picking up
-The 2017 tax cuts were the second-largest in U.S. history
-Stocks are up nearly 27 percent

2697 2019-02-06 00:27:21 So basically Cardi B could be much richer than she already is but never learned  to manage her money. She need to start watching Vlad Stocks.
2698 2019-02-06 00:27:19 A timely reference to cod economics as the Times yesterday carried an article that said our traditional fish & chip supper is at risk under #Brexit.  Apparently we need access to cod & haddock stocks in Norwegian waters but will be denied them if we leave without a trade deal.
2699 2019-02-06 00:25:56 Motley fool ends most of their investing articles with a sales pitch of ten stocks they have on their buy list. As a daily reader, I’ve found them reference 5 in recent weeks: $amzn $nvda $ma $dis $sfix anyone find the other 5?
2700 2019-02-06 00:24:55 Let's break that down. Stocks went down because Wallstreet was not sure if it can (a) grow as a business and if it can (b) increase users.
2701 2019-02-06 00:23:28 Stocks
2702 2019-02-06 00:23:14 ah, yes. The world of money. Finance, books, stocks and bonds— my knowledge of these things are why I am known in my “inner circle” if you will, as the Wizard of Wall Street
2703 2019-02-06 00:22:02 I retired & dropped all stocks in Feb of 2017.  I really thought that we'd see a big drop in the market... for a while I thought I had made a mistake, but stocks are essentially where they were in Feb 2017 & big drop in market is still on horizon.
2704 2019-02-06 00:21:02 Axis mf or stocks.
How u would select a mutual fund for 15+% return on 10y average?

2705 2019-02-06 00:20:52 I was listening to killer Mike and Joe Rogan interview and he said that he bought his wife thousands of dollars worth of stocks for Christmas, What was more impressive was the message that came with it, He said:
2706 2019-02-06 00:20:33 Buying stocks too because wheewww chile I loathe washing dishes
2707 2019-02-06 00:20:29 Chrysalis raised an eyebrow, swaying her hips teasingly. 

“Spanking? Night in the stocks?”
2708 2019-02-06 00:19:04 just invest ur money into big stocks is dumb.
2709 2019-02-06 00:18:17 Did your charts forecast the poor returns on the top seven dividend paying Oz stocks in 2018?
2710 2019-02-06 00:16:52 Juli, lives on Caribbean Ave with wife and lots of kids.

2711 2019-02-06 00:14:19 He needs to be tarred and feathered and then have to spend a month in stocks in the town square in every capital city around Australia and also the regional centres.

Once he's completed that, then sack him.
2712 2019-02-06 00:13:28 Is “wealth” in this instance referring specifically to cash assets? Or could it be real estate, stocks, etc very likely “inherited” by several people?
2713 2019-02-06 00:13:02 Stocks plunged as First Data Corporation unveiled a composed dagger today.
2714 2019-02-06 00:12:38 The market’s march to the 200-day and beyond continued today ahead of the State of the Union address. Rumor has it you’re going to hear a little about dialing back drug prices, which should put some of the drug stocks under pressure tomorrow.
2715 2019-02-06 00:11:21 Didn't he sell his steel stocks before the tariffs?
2716 2019-02-06 00:11:13 The real question: Did you remember before they were on the brink? Words I constantly utter to my stocks: “what the...didn’t I flip you just last week...maybe it really was three weeks ago?!”

2718 2019-02-06 00:09:58 There's always going to be ups and downs. That's how stocks work. Not every movement is the govt's doing.

Btw watch it climb even higher after the SOTU, gonna be glorious
2719 2019-02-06 00:08:07 A lot of oems are running their invs down seasonally and due to uncertainty/unwilling to start some new builds on the worries over demand- ending possible tariffs and less demand concerns could reverse that other direction- yes, think ST stocks have prob bounced too far though
2720 2019-02-06 00:07:44 Estate taxes are different than inheritance taxes and easy to avoid. And if you reduce that initial pool of capital, wouldn’t you be able to reduce the resulting inequality?

The idea that returns on capital is greater than growth has been around forever. Hence stocks, no?
2721 2019-02-06 00:05:25 My OH has absolutely no idea about stocks, preparedness nor the podcast. I’ll happily smooth things over for you by talking with your Mrs over a cuppa. Because we’ll be the ones able to get a cuppa...
2722 2019-02-06 00:05:03 SEBI has recently come out with revised guidelines for ETFs and Index Funds. By capping the Max exposure to 35 % for one stock and 65 % for top 3 stocks, what risk is being addressed ?
2723 2019-02-06 00:02:54 Nope. Housing has been terrible. Prices up, rates up. Housing stocks have been beat up
Farmers can't afford farm equipment.
