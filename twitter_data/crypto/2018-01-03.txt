12 2018-01-03 23:59:29 Um, I mean like, at least they aren't storing *my* crypto private keys. I know that because I don't store those on websites, so even with their permissions, they don't have them. As opposed to MetaMask, which would have even worse potential in such an event.

42 2018-01-03 23:58:41 @btcxindia Its crazy that you are not allowing deposit of neither ripple nor fiat currency.  You are handling just one country and if that is too big,  just one crypto coin n still not abe to handle the load smoothly.  Due to your inefficiency why should we suffer.

61 2018-01-03 23:57:26 Too bad fiat currencies are also just as vulnerable if not more so. You could actually use these exploits to walk right into a stock exchange or banking system. Even ATMs are likely vulnerable to this. Crypto might actually be more secure than fiat now because of this.

95 2018-01-03 23:54:59 You guys might think this is hilarious, but some of us are trying to stack $ too. For ex: Debt, loans, bills, mortgage, secondary income +. Weather we like it or not cash is still king, and until we can use company's like utrust to pay bills, it's beneficial to play both markets.
96 2018-01-03 23:54:56 Tron to hit USD 0.1 by the end of the week! Binance whales have nothing to do but push every single crypto above USD0.1!
97 2018-01-03 23:54:55 Happy birthday bitcoin. 03 Jan 2009. Most of us nearly heard about it until recently. And now your kids are talking to you about blockchains and u hear the critics of the banks, crying wolf in the newspapers. What’s next in 2018?

106 2018-01-03 23:54:19 What we need are people investing in real coins with an actual use case. If the money flows in the right hands we can change crypto for the better! Let your money speak! Buy Stellar and not ripple, buy Bitcoin instead of Bcash, NAV / Zcoin instead of Verge etc. Be the change!

140 2018-01-03 23:52:11 In the spirit of crypto, a free market decides what goods and services should be available. If the market for such services didn't exist then they wouldn't be available. Although, I too despise "newcomers" parading as experts as well.
141 2018-01-03 23:52:05 Me gusta $nrhyy . Yo opero crypto en Binance.A mi criterio el mejor exchange.

149 2018-01-03 23:51:17 Couldn't agree more.  "The subtle art of not giving a F*ck" is a really great read that deals with these very issues in an unconventional yet meaninful way.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
150 2018-01-03 23:51:10 True that.
151 2018-01-03 23:51:08 Keep up the great hard work. I really do appreciate everything you guys are doing. I am so sorry for all the negative abuse you are getting from impatient nitwits. I still believe in your crypto and will hold till the very end.
152 2018-01-03 23:51:04 Why we need more secure cloud solutions, say Sia?

160 2018-01-03 23:50:24 BTC will stand forever. Any coin trying to fill the gap will be there doing only that, filling the gap, until it figures itself out in the next ten years. Make gains and watch it soar long term.

162 2018-01-03 23:50:17 What’s the best way to store TRON ?
163 2018-01-03 23:50:14 Since you are in contact with mercatox, are you sure that they didnt exit scam us?
164 2018-01-03 23:50:14 THEY bought with BTC, so theoretically they did not have all this discount, and if they consider the potential of this project, I think it will not clear that much.
165 2018-01-03 23:50:12 Keep up the great hard work. I really do appreciate everything you guys are doing. I am so sorry for all the negative abuse you are getting from impatient nitwits. I still believe in your crypto and will hold till the end.
166 2018-01-03 23:50:09 Haha wow, the $XRP 1 month chart.. It looks like a skinny boy who got rippled in his grandma's basement overdosing on steroids. #Ripple #crypto $BTC #bitcoin #ripplethestandard

170 2018-01-03 23:50:00 I prefer the trezor UI and hardware over Ledger. But I have both for different crypto. Ledger is just kinda buggy and annoying that you have to install a bunch of chrome extensions for each alt.

174 2018-01-03 23:49:55 Nice timing. Just as when people are starting to realize #ripple is bad crypto here comes the FUD to $BTC #bitcoin. I just hope an institution this huge would not allow articles based on rumors.

178 2018-01-03 23:49:28 Klingons lived peacefully for thousands of years before becoming a race of warriors. 

Then Satoshi invented Bitcoin and the great Crypto wars turned the Klingon houses against each other.
179 2018-01-03 23:49:27 Had my first experience of someone talking about $XRP who has no background in crypto. His brother had rang him to say put some money in because he'd been looking into it as an investment. The mainstream is now beginning. $XRP
180 2018-01-03 23:49:21 Justin, next year I wanna see you as the most influential person in crypto !
181 2018-01-03 23:49:10 If #crypto will replace financial institutions then at what point do we stop valuing #BTC #ETH #LTC #BCH in fiat value. #Blockchain
182 2018-01-03 23:49:05 What he means is he wants steal your crypto with a malicious program. Notice how I get to the McAfee tweets first every time. If his "bot" worked, he'd be here first.
183 2018-01-03 23:48:59 ""I think that there are more women involved in crypto than most people realise. From what I've seen they are getting into it quietly and seriously, and do not particularly want to interact with the nobhead men who post about Lambos/wen moon/pepe the frog memes.""

187 2018-01-03 23:48:42 Not at all. It’s not a true crypto and therefore I can’t justify its place in crypto. As a centralized bank settlement tool yes.

193 2018-01-03 23:48:16 Serious thought - has anyone talked about crypto currencies becoming the dominant form of space money? If Elon’s colonizing other planets, they wouldn’t take dollars. Looking at you @fintechfrank to dig into this.
194 2018-01-03 23:48:14 I think that a LOT of the newer money coming into crypto isn't into crypto Twitter

211 2018-01-03 23:47:36 BarterDex does not provide any privacy IIRC. The privacy aspect of zDEX is what will really make it stand out.
212 2018-01-03 23:47:34 it's NOT a shitcoin. Just because McAfee did what he can to FUD it and developers in addition to that was late to announce Wraith this doesnt make coin bad. Team is not so professional -yes. Coin and technology is good.
213 2018-01-03 23:47:33 Has never had an ICO...
214 2018-01-03 23:47:29 Bitcoin is an encrypted currency that has no backing from any government or bank. Its made by the people for the use of people. It has nothing tangible, the value is only worth what people want to pay for it. There’s about 20 other crypto currency out there. It’s very volatile
215 2018-01-03 23:47:27 ZCL !
216 2018-01-03 23:47:26 So true!
217 2018-01-03 23:47:18 Yep I don't think it's a bad thing. It doesn't get as much negative press like BTC and Monero because it's not used for the same purposes.  I think it's helping crypto come out of the shadows and accepted by the main world.
218 2018-01-03 23:47:15 Do you think it's a buy ? It's broken out hasn't it ?
219 2018-01-03 23:47:13 I see thank you!
220 2018-01-03 23:47:12 Ripple's skyrocketing price shows the incredible market enthusiasm for crypto even before demonstrable commercial traction.
221 2018-01-03 23:47:05 Thanks for your feedback!
222 2018-01-03 23:47:05 Could you add me plz ben. Seen alot of hype on #crypto and %gains but daunting putting $ into something you dnt quite understand is daunting. Mind you i thought #prem would far more advanced by now #whatdoiknow cheers

228 2018-01-03 23:46:44 And btc investors are not greedy?
Good morning dude: 99.9% of all people in crypto space just want to gain money... like banksters.
So what is the difference between btc and the old system?
Btc: Early investor try to be the new rich ones, late investors are the new poor ones.
229 2018-01-03 23:46:42 Ltc is no where near being #2 to Bitcoin. More like #10. The market lost faith in Ltc from the poor PR of the Creator. I honestly took profit when he did. Nobody is going to get a Nobel Peace Prize for trying to be a nice guy in this crypto world. Its kill or be killed.
230 2018-01-03 23:46:42 xlm stellar My 2 cents of the day - Every time you meet someone who is skeptical of a Crypto Currency you are invested in. Ask them this question: Can you please explain to me in detail why are you skeptic and where did you get your information from? most have no clue about C.C
231 2018-01-03 23:46:41 @TLDoublelift man I tried to give you info on your stream for another crypto and you said you didn't want my grandfathers crypto remember?  Check $IOTA  and $VEN.  Good luck man:)

237 2018-01-03 23:46:32 Dude you speak sense XRP has people believing it's going to bring in $1000 a coin... It needs customers first XLM will see it out where Ripple can't.
238 2018-01-03 23:46:14 It was explained to me that when you request a transaction it get farmed out to somebody who decrypts, makes trans and re-encrypts....
239 2018-01-03 23:46:12 Hi Jeff, I would like to pitch you on collaborating on BombCoins, imagine how easy it would be to buy lootboxes or in game consumables if we had a centralized crypto currency for video games that could be earned while you play video games.
240 2018-01-03 23:46:09 #TRX #TRON has done a healthy x3 for me. With I put in a full 2k - that’s the trouble with crypto, like Pokemon you can’t catch ‘em all!
241 2018-01-03 23:46:00 I would be sad because there's school tomorrow but I just sold a load of crypto so I'm feeling pretty lit.

249 2018-01-03 23:45:28 5/ Yes, if you buy $XRB you may have slightly less money than yesterday, but think long term. Bitcoin 'crashed' many times on it's rise, so why should you think differently of #XRB

252 2018-01-03 23:45:21 What a breathtaking day in European time zone crypto. More ATHs for $XRP and some huge moves in $XLM, $XEM and $ADA. $ETH flirting with $1k now too and a sea of green. I presume $BTC will move soon?  2018 has started like a rocket.
253 2018-01-03 23:45:16 If you guys see and thing about a $DBC airdrop it's a scam... These idiots out here trying to ruin Crypto

258 2018-01-03 23:44:56 I don't like these new people in crypto. They're all so political. Thank God bittrex stopped adding new people.
259 2018-01-03 23:44:54 #RippleForTheDipple has no place in crypto top 10 let alone top 1! It’s just a cryptographically secure centralized currency.
260 2018-01-03 23:44:52 Is there anything $CVC won't be used for?  It will be involved in so many  areas of life.  The crypto with the most real world use case application and solving many screwed up problems. Get some.
261 2018-01-03 23:44:48 At the end of the day, banks would want to work with centralized currency, whether its china, japan etc. Crypto is meant to be decentralized

265 2018-01-03 23:44:38 As a muslim, i can confirm this is bullshit. crypto's are no different from gold or silver, just a means of exchange. Some terrorists wear nike shoes to walk. does that mean nike supports terrorism? absolutley not.
266 2018-01-03 23:44:35 Ripple is a bank project. People arent buying XPR with fiat currency, they're buying it with BTC. What better way to destroy the crypto market than acquiring it all?

288 2018-01-03 23:43:18 I imagine it has something to do with so many crypto startups that aren’t actually decentralized / are simply taking advantage of ability to fundraise by using “blockchain” or “token”
289 2018-01-03 23:43:14 How soon before the banks start to saturate the market for crypto?

310 2018-01-03 23:41:50 Just ordered this book looks like it's gonna be a good read
311 2018-01-03 23:41:50 Fuck crypto currency, this is where the bank is at! I’ll start stocking up now
312 2018-01-03 23:41:46 Short or long?
313 2018-01-03 23:41:40 Not pumped
314 2018-01-03 23:41:31 what u thinking Scott? I think it was b/c Nunes gave him till end of day to turn over docs or be in contempt? something else going on?
315 2018-01-03 23:41:21 This is fad.. but, we’ll soon see big brands launching their own crypto tokens, similar to gift card programs.. brand loyalty will get blockchained..
316 2018-01-03 23:41:19 Furthermore, it isn't even crypto. Decentralization is a key component in all Coinbase coin considerations.
317 2018-01-03 23:41:14 Merci! Putain ça serai fou..
318 2018-01-03 23:41:10 LOL there is no coin to dump, what are you even talking about? Id stop looking at all projects in terms of speculating how much ROI youre going to get from them and more for the fundamental and technical innovations. But of course this is crypto where poop rises to the top (XRP)
319 2018-01-03 23:41:06 Nope
320 2018-01-03 23:40:59 It's a means of transfer. For now at least. And idk about that, banks will adopt cryptos they can "regulate", and bigger banks / institutions will want their crypto to succeed. You forget different banks in china, us, india, japan, korea, they all have their own agenda.
321 2018-01-03 23:40:59 dawg!!! the crypto market is hot!!!! one coin got nearly 1045 percent gain!!!

331 2018-01-03 23:40:35 I can appreciate how you think that but he knows how to troll very well and there's no denying the excellent changes that he has already made in 12 months. Be happy ..2018 is going to be even better than 2017. The Trump Admin. is also extremely bullish on blockchain tech!
332 2018-01-03 23:40:34 Pretty new to crypto currency, but already love holding Litecoin.  Can I get 1 more lol?
333 2018-01-03 23:40:28 Tried this a couple days ago, wouldn’t recommend it. But it’s might try again
334 2018-01-03 23:40:27 What's a good sell point for cnd? Can you elaborate on MCO? It looks like a resistance line to watch is. 001035 or about?

343 2018-01-03 23:39:33 Don't think they did because nation state fiat is backed by armies whereas Bitcoin fiat is backed by sweet fuck all really.
344 2018-01-03 23:39:33 Hey Crypto News thanks for the follow!
345 2018-01-03 23:39:32 Le ripple a 10$ ça fait une capitalisation 370 B$ quand le BTC a un total de 250 B$ actuellement. Je dis pas que c’est impossible mais si ça arrive, les cryptos c est vraiment n’importe quoi !
346 2018-01-03 23:39:29 I almost made my salary in only 8mo in crypto .Made a ton of mistakes and still almost made my salary lol 2018 gonna be amazing

349 2018-01-03 23:39:14 Blockchainウォレットの便利なところはクラウドだったこと。
同じBTC財布をiPadからでもパソコンからでも見られました。
しかし，復元フレーズを使えば，どのウォレットでも（例えばcopayでも）同じことができました。
考えれば当たり前のことですが，実際にできて嬉しい
350 2018-01-03 23:39:14 Sehe ich ähnlich. Besser Mal selbst eigenes Wallet anlegen und etwas spielen. Dann begreift man vielleicht besser was alles möglich ist und wie die Community tickt. Crypto Go!

358 2018-01-03 23:38:42 $Neo breaks  100 $$$$ !!!! #Crypto
359 2018-01-03 23:38:42 one thing that must be said about $ZCL is that the $BTCP team surely knows how to spice things up. the timing today and other times proves this. many teams in crypto unintentionally rek their own coins with bad public strategies. look at what happened to $MCO months ago....
360 2018-01-03 23:38:39 #coinsmarkets is poorly made exchange for crypto traders, which isn't worth any respect and trust of their clients. Closing because of too high traffic, brought by $eca :) Our $btc are stuck there because of their irresponsibility. Wanted more $eca and $emb.

374 2018-01-03 23:37:36 Mate, It is no problem if Bitcoin consolidates for a while.
375 2018-01-03 23:37:31 3/ $XRB 'is to be a scalable, free, decentralized currency', and is exactly that. It can handle over 7000 transactions per second, 1000x that of bitcoin's 7 transactions per second. Oh yeah, and it's free.

376 2018-01-03 23:37:27 I am seeing a lot of crypto FOMO out there.  That and the huge profits already made might keep the space hot for a while.  Being nimble among coins and long/short bias will be key imo.
377 2018-01-03 23:37:26 REEEEEEEE!!
378 2018-01-03 23:37:06 I don't use Twitter.... I am here just for news...
379 2018-01-03 23:37:05 Do you know what a "Bail In" is? It's the reason Crypto is going to skyrocket soon. It's also the Reason $USDT is going to collapse. Eventually. Just FYI.
380 2018-01-03 23:36:59 You expect a Trillion dollar market cap? That's the current value across ALL crypto.

391 2018-01-03 23:36:43 The only way to build value on this coin is opening your own exchange as soon as you can. Stop trying to list your "exchange" on other exchanges, counter intuitive and just insult to injury after ripping the lending platform out from under investors.

2. It’s not a SSoV (Stable Store of Value - aka StableCoin in crypto-speak)

457 2018-01-03 23:32:56 Well maybe shitcoin but offers thing that NONE of 3000 coins can offer :) 2 blockchains at once - private and public. Also full anonymity if you gonna use always private one.

465 2018-01-03 23:32:37 That’s it I’m investing in crypto currencies
466 2018-01-03 23:32:35 1/ $XRB price is very low now - a great time to buy. This coin is still extremely undervalued and is one of the only coins I feel confident enough to #HODL long term.

470 2018-01-03 23:32:19 CFD's in random stuff just scalping and crypto currency. Ripples gone up like 40% since yesterday! Got hargreves lansdown for my long term investments, just pissing about with some spare cash tbh. But with these returns i might have to stick a lump down 
471 2018-01-03 23:32:10 2018 is the year of crypto. 
these gains already are INSANE
472 2018-01-03 23:32:07 $XRP の新聞効果、どうだろうなあ…アレを見て新しく「買いだ！」ってなる一般層は少ないんじゃないかなあ。

474 2018-01-03 23:32:06 Besides getting hacked or a technical error, there should practically be no way you lose money in crypto over the long term
475 2018-01-03 23:32:02 @VinnyLingham , cvc ?
476 2018-01-03 23:32:01 No one is buying the coin :(
477 2018-01-03 23:31:57 Let us know which coin you are looking forward to buy
478 2018-01-03 23:31:56 Je vais Check le @CoinMarketCap demain matin mais putain 10$ ça fait beaucoup pour le Ripple haha.. je l’imaginais même pas à 1$ le mois dernier
479 2018-01-03 23:31:50 @WalletGenerator I love that there's a multi-crypto wallet generator, makes life so much simpler. Would be great if there was a 'bulk -paper wallet-" option, though!
480 2018-01-03 23:31:40 Good intro, and whilst IFA's ought to give advice, when Crypto doesn't pay them fees, and delivers more growth in a day than they deliver in a year, particularly true for terrible Irish performance relative to S&P, you might want to say 'what Ripple, Ethereum & Bitcoin offer'
481 2018-01-03 23:31:39 Best of luck to you as well.
482 2018-01-03 23:31:35 20 billion market cap?? hmmmm

495 2018-01-03 23:30:47 Oh pls, he is almost always right. I even did experiment and bought what he predicted to rise and 100% always rised. I know it's impossible to know what will rise, but fuck it..so far it works.

510 2018-01-03 23:29:41 Yeah
511 2018-01-03 23:29:36 あけましておめでとうとございます。
本年も楽しく仮想通貨に投資していきます！
512 2018-01-03 23:29:30 Ripple $XRP looking beautiful today. $XLM, $TRX, $ADA I'm in. 2018 will be a huge year for all 4 as cash becomes obsolete starting in China and US following shortly after, and banks start mass adopting crypto for instant transfers. Calling it now.
513 2018-01-03 23:29:30 Haven't checked yet. Not as high as some guys I know, but probably somewhere near infinity.

Looking forward to their ICOs though. Might have to grab some more dragons for ICOs. Not sure I want to part with my ancient ICO slumbering $DRGN.
514 2018-01-03 23:29:27 I’m invested in $PAY too. Imagine what’s going to happen when the US implements the law allowing <$600 transactions in crypto to be tax free. Guess what card were all going to want to use....
515 2018-01-03 23:29:24 i have been making big money on $ITNS   intense coin is very new. VPN service and has big community.

517 2018-01-03 23:29:17 I know. You'd think they'd listen to various sources instead of their emotional intelligence. Which is apparently as low as their IQ.

521 2018-01-03 23:28:59 It is definitely overvalued but it’s the Coinbase hype that it’s riding on
522 2018-01-03 23:28:56 Never said anyone should open then. I said that area is where I’m filling it up.
523 2018-01-03 23:28:54 Is there an exchange that has both?
524 2018-01-03 23:28:50 Hey Crypto Guy, not sure that was someone else’s quote not mine check the link for more info
525 2018-01-03 23:28:43 I just sold my iota, eos, 25% of neo and used that to get ethereum and have some more up for sale for more ethererum at the moment.   i got my ADA at $.21 and am hodling those.
526 2018-01-03 23:28:43 Welcome back 
527 2018-01-03 23:28:42 I mean no disrespect. I have 3 weeks experience in the crypto world.( Talk about a crash course.) If I give you my wallet address, Can't you steal my coins?
528 2018-01-03 23:28:26 New to crypto but since I have seen dev working so hard I am all for it never gambled before i put half my saving in VERGE since dec 2017 and gonna be holding all the way! And this PR page is really reassuring and much appreciated #VergeFam DEP: DEhyd3Ti42Jx7GoEw1YxiwoDu2WcoGazP6
529 2018-01-03 23:28:24 I think I agree with you. The irrational exuberance will not last for everyone in the crypto space.
530 2018-01-03 23:28:21 Officially invested in crypto currency for the first time.
531 2018-01-03 23:28:20 Lotta people getting rich off of bitcoin/crypto. I'm over here gettin middle class

535 2018-01-03 23:28:12 Just Dm me if your new to crypto coins and would like to invest. Learn from my initial mistakes and save on fees. You don't need £1000s to invest I started with £80!!
536 2018-01-03 23:28:06 Soon not centalized, it's not controlled by ripple, and has no unlimited supply, and yes, no mining (green crypto)
Just read and learn...

538 2018-01-03 23:28:03 Its been extremely frustrating for me as coinspot isnt allowing new deposits. So holding 300,000 Verge coins for 3 weeks now...while other ships are sailing. My choice so not blaming. but it's extremely frustrating.

588 2018-01-03 23:23:31 With crypto being so popular now, it's time to looking deeper into "news" &  such, people throwing around money into this magic dust, see some gains & turn into crypto wizards overnight. Just have 1 issue w/your wallet and you'll realize where we stand, ZERO support from apps.

613 2018-01-03 23:21:45 @boxmining hey Michael I want to don’t my fiat money to you! I’m hodling my crypto right now so any chance you have a patreon account or something like that? I’m really enjoying your YouTube channel
614 2018-01-03 23:21:38 No.
615 2018-01-03 23:21:36 Don’t be impatient. Yes, other people are becoming millionaires and trading with hundreds of thousands of dollars. But it can take months to years. Everyone in $crypto now can have that chance if you are patient and investing in quality coins - long run. Also: $XVG is a scam coin

622 2018-01-03 23:21:14 They announced on NYE that the windows QT wallet with TOR integration was released. For me that is not the full Wraith announcement.
623 2018-01-03 23:21:12 who aint buying msp

what are you doing

we could all be crypto rich

not in it for the money
624 2018-01-03 23:21:10 Because we already have so many crypto currencies solving the above? Everything has its place, there are banks that do good such as building societies and maybe even charities that transfer cash around the world quickly as aid, air bnb Uber eBay Amazon. We would all pay less fees

629 2018-01-03 23:20:48 Up until 2018 the crypto space has been filled with bitcoin maximalists - now smart people, with much larger wallets are coming in - and they don't care about these old ideologies. They care about the best product (fast, cheapest, most scalable) w/ real utility. Tides are turning

635 2018-01-03 23:20:37  I wonder if there is some way to tell if a cryptocurrency and the market in general is overvalued. 

What is the difference between strong growth and adoption in the crypto market vs unhealthy highs?

645 2018-01-03 23:19:55 @richardbranson Do you see Crypto as a sound investment and if so, any in particular?  Please, this whole retirement future hasn't worked out so far.
646 2018-01-03 23:19:54 Local purchases aren’t the killer app for crypto. International or remote transfers are. I sent $5 worth of LTC the other day to a guy in Switzerland to pay for his beer as a thank you. Transfer confirmed in 5 minutes max. Try that with swift or international bank xfers.

654 2018-01-03 23:19:27 A: It is not pure speculation. A very good case can be made for CB listing.
B: No-one is making the argument that XRP will not go down and up in price.
655 2018-01-03 23:19:25 Glad to see it holding steady at $.14.
656 2018-01-03 23:19:24 It will be over $1 by the end of Q2 which is like $7.34 in dog money
657 2018-01-03 23:19:17 What's your thoughts on xrp Dan?
658 2018-01-03 23:19:10 We should all just move to SoCal and talk crypto together.
659 2018-01-03 23:19:04 Coin of the week or month : $EOS 
EOS appears to be a direct competitor to Ethereum. Now price is around $9. But it will be rise soon take it and wait until when it's going up. My target 18-25 usd. #altcoin #altcoins #Blockchain #Cryptocurrency #cryptotrading #crypto
660 2018-01-03 23:19:03 Crypto is becoming today's currency 
661 2018-01-03 23:19:02 i hardly doubt on TRX...no real unique idea behind it...don't be fooled by the pump
662 2018-01-03 23:18:47 being used for, then the value of the currency in a centralized market makes sense... there will have to be a bridge that gaps fiat and crypto and can handle the transaction load.  XRP may not end up being just that but its a step in the right direction

681 2018-01-03 23:17:18 That being said, I'm not going all in on crypto as you never know what's going to happen. Am trying to diversify with businesses and real estate etc. to create multiple sources of income. Rather have enough money coming in and be able to quit my day job then buy a lambo.

686 2018-01-03 23:16:59 Do you know how I can short all this crypto-crap?
687 2018-01-03 23:16:53 Not so sure about XRP. There are many things in the pipeline. If listing on coinbase is announced or the household partner names are revealed, it is hard to fathom money sliding down the list from XRP, even if the price action has been ridiculous of late.
688 2018-01-03 23:16:49 they announce it already or not? I think the official of official announcement will publish when Wraith will be released fully working (when bugfixes are done)
689 2018-01-03 23:16:48 Wasn’t Bitcoin going to hit higher highs today?
690 2018-01-03 23:16:42 yes it does,

If BTC value increase > Your investment

You come out ahead.
691 2018-01-03 23:16:40 Le total supply du Ripple est énorme, ça m’étonnerait de le voir à 10$ dans les mois qui viennent... près tout est possible dans les ce monde de fou
692 2018-01-03 23:16:36 Yeah well then you should be invested in XRP before there is a global shut down of all other shitcoins and ICOs. Read about scam a Ponzi scheme and 95% of all other crypto symbols will be underneath lol you’re just adjusting to XRP that’s all
693 2018-01-03 23:16:34 Haejin can you please add time prediction to? Like how long does it take to reach those goals. Thanks

697 2018-01-03 23:16:11 Sold half my XVG yesterday to buy stellar. Stellar move I'll say.  to the moon it is

700 2018-01-03 23:15:52 Why do people support #ripple #xrp when it’s partnering with the very centralized financial institutions in which the whole block chain crypto currency movement is supposed to move us away from? I’m either ignorant of something or very confused? Someone educate me please?
701 2018-01-03 23:15:47 @yedincikapi what's your opinion on the SEC and Crypto?
702 2018-01-03 23:15:43 If you think ripple have been working their asses of doing pilots and making partnerships since 2011 and are going to flop when all eyes and attention are on crypto then you should do some more research.
703 2018-01-03 23:15:36 It’s cute seeing kids new to the crypto game making 500$ in a night and I’m over here not even satisfied with making 10k in a night

722 2018-01-03 23:14:19 Hmm. Did you have a late night? Crypto = speed, decentralization and true ownership. Gold is centrally held, and if you do not own the keys which alter the blockchain, you do not have true ownership. Granted, you can move it quickly.

726 2018-01-03 23:13:58 My goal with Crypto is to get enough passive income that I can live from it. My biggest holding will always be NEO but am going big on @OntologyNetwork + @neonexchange too. Other than that I bought some @vechainofficial and @cosscrypto as they will generate income as well.

757 2018-01-03 23:12:00 Your cbd content is 1.7 so double or triple the amount of thc in the oil.
758 2018-01-03 23:11:58 Damn I just made a deal with a professional gambler where I'll be managing his crypto investments for him.

I'll get 20% of all the profits I make for him and take 0% of the loss if the investments go down. 

He wants to start with $20,000.
759 2018-01-03 23:11:55 Ha ha.

今、私は何を感謝しているだろうか。
762 2018-01-03 23:11:47 I guess thats one of the problems of trying to do updates on crypto. 
The market is virtually 24/7 and  never stands still. 
By the time you finish making your notes things have moved 100's of % and everyone's a millionaire.
763 2018-01-03 23:11:41 An excerpt from his blog: “Due to states’ overwhelming preference for consumer protection”. Right. That’s why alcohol, cigarettes, and opiates disguised as medicine are all illegal. The state cares so much about protecting consumers!!!!
764 2018-01-03 23:11:35 Thanks a lot Spencer! :)
765 2018-01-03 23:11:34 That's in the whole bottle.  And the amount that actually absorbs is minimal.  Do you ever hear any stoners say"I got high af of that lotion"
766 2018-01-03 23:11:33 Hahaha there's a crypto called bread 
767 2018-01-03 23:11:33 I'm buying a portion of @TradeToken it seems like a good pick and i need to diverse a bit. #ICO #Altcoins #Blockchain #Crypto #alts $BTC $ETH

779 2018-01-03 23:10:48 You are a bottom
780 2018-01-03 23:10:42 Depends if it has thc or cbd only. If it’s cbd only you won’t get high. Thc you’ll definitely have some fun
781 2018-01-03 23:10:41 @jimcramer You didn't think Nvidia would rally? They produce some of the best GPU's for crypto mining...
782 2018-01-03 23:10:33 #its happens with ripple
783 2018-01-03 23:10:33 Unless formulated as a transdermal patch, there is no significant absorption of cannabinoids (compounds in cannabis) through the skin as a lotion.

785 2018-01-03 23:10:25 Should of ate the gummies and then smoked a joint and you would be well and truly cooked

798 2018-01-03 23:09:46 Go and follow @CryptoEye111 - a good news source for all things crypto, as well as a humble mindset to keep you grounded.
799 2018-01-03 23:09:44 What do you you mean “You People!?!?!”
800 2018-01-03 23:09:44 Haha. I’m a hodler. I think it is better to focus on my core job/business unless crypto trading is the main source of income. I do reading with this pattern
801 2018-01-03 23:09:44 thats a dog shit lazy response to try and assume the extra coin will drive down price when the total supply is already known and the interval in which it is released is already known.  Its far more predictable than ANY crypto still being mined.
802 2018-01-03 23:09:34 They are all highly invested in crypto and Bitcoin. A cataclysmic Bitcoin crash would have the possibility of killing crypto. Maybe not. But it's a hell of a risk for companies that are literally printing money.
803 2018-01-03 23:09:34 Indifferent of our actual trading success how about Crypto OG tech category like "I started mining before GPU miners became popular, and I've kept up since then and saved/lived on it the best I can"? I think several OGs we all revere can IDfy with even the least fortunate of us.
804 2018-01-03 23:09:32 En tant qu'auto-entrepreneur le plafond achat/revente est passé à 170K l'année, taxé ~14%. T'as l'option prélèvement libératoire sur l'impôt qui ajoute 2.2% de taxe et qui remplace l'impôt sur le revenu. En gros 17%. A vérifier mais c'est plutôt correct
805 2018-01-03 23:09:31 Yea u need to find a pure cbd oil. They have plenty that still have thc in them. The massage oil I use is pure cbd and honestly the best
806 2018-01-03 23:09:25 Acabo de redistribuir el portfolio, he comprado $DRGN $DENT $POSW $LEND $PAY
807 2018-01-03 23:09:19 I own some of this. Will hold for more profits

809 2018-01-03 23:09:16 nvm, yeah, you can totally get a buzz off this.. this doesnt look like lotion like you thought it was! put it in a vape lol
810 2018-01-03 23:09:14 Blockchain Walletからcopayに移動中：
「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」があり，0.5BTC送るだけで送料が800円も必要になっている！
これまで，細かく分けて送ることで安く済ませて来たが，だんだん高くなってきているような気が(^_^;
811 2018-01-03 23:09:14 The Litecoin School of Crypto <3 you.
812 2018-01-03 23:09:09 stop thinking so short term. HODL. you will be saying fuck me when it goes back to 34 and you sell and then it goes to 100
813 2018-01-03 23:09:07 The crypto addiction is real! That’s my backup plan. I’m in if you plan on launching a new company on the blockchain (Allie Beck here)
814 2018-01-03 23:09:00 There's a lot to learn on crypto currency and trading, Sukh gave me some great advice but honestly the only way you can really learn the ropes is by researching and literally following the markets. You will quickly learn from mistakes and carry on.
815 2018-01-03 23:08:59 But of course this has nothing to do with bitcoin or any crypto assets which are ROCK SOLID!
816 2018-01-03 23:08:57 Je bouffe quand meme depuis 1 mois+ 6-7h de crypto par jour (vidéo/forum/discord etc..) XD
817 2018-01-03 23:08:56 I was trading on these exchanges, Mintpal, Cryptsy, Cryptorush ... 

This is a very good advice ;)

If you are daytrading, you should split your funds on multiple exchanges
818 2018-01-03 23:08:55 So many new crypto investors are waiting to buy Tezos, this will be fun 
819 2018-01-03 23:08:55 Ethanol is used to extract the CBD that’s a pretty chemical free product man
820 2018-01-03 23:08:48 "I want to learn how to find good trades" is a question I am asked often. The process is one of elimination. What's left, you can't say no to, there is your trade. Ask the right question, get the right answer. Do you know the right questions? $BTC #crypto #trading

828 2018-01-03 23:08:26 Lo que está pasando en este momento es que los picos de búsqueda están haciendo que haya "interés" y ahí es donde entran los dummies. Los millonarios son otra cosa, ellos son otra parte del trasfondo de las crypto.

847 2018-01-03 23:07:17 We are with you Justin, all the way!! But realize that the crypto market is so volatile that investors don't want their money to get stuck in one coin for ever without seeing any gains. Let's get the mighty #WraithProtocol out soon!!

855 2018-01-03 23:06:52 That sucks. If you lost your private key though, there's nothing that can be done. It's the backbone of crypto.

860 2018-01-03 23:06:19 definitely can, but won't be a high really, more pain relief
861 2018-01-03 23:06:19 lol... no... not once... ever.
862 2018-01-03 23:06:15 Me too!!! Getting anxious about Verge!! Time for it to climb!
863 2018-01-03 23:06:06 CBD is cannaboids. They are everything but the stuff that get you 'high'. They are known as the medical properties of cannabis.Unless the thc has been decarboxylated and mixed with the bloodstream you cannot get high from it. You're rubbing heavens oils on your body, relax...
864 2018-01-03 23:06:05 Didn’t even see that HAHAHAHA but there’s so many fallacies in here I can’t help but be drawn to it
865 2018-01-03 23:05:59 Confirmed, uncles died from bathing with a weed bath bomb. Equivalent of smoking 30 joints. RIP 11/13/14

867 2018-01-03 23:05:38 Depends on the thc concentration and the cbd:thc ratio. But you definitely will not die. Promise.

870 2018-01-03 23:05:16 This article almost makes me feel ashamed to be part of the crypto community. It seems as if a great divide has taken place between hardcore Bitcoin maximalists and 'gen 2' crypto fanatics. The latter increasingly seem to be the opend-minded ones.
871 2018-01-03 23:05:16 There’s a lot the goes into it that you need to know but the main entry point into crypto is coinbase (you can download the app)

874 2018-01-03 23:05:05 So you are talking about 60% gains in 2 days from now. Just WOW. I would be so happy. Where will this end in january :o
875 2018-01-03 23:05:03 Yes the Cbd lotion is absorbed and treats pain stress etc.  You will not od or get high.  Meh
876 2018-01-03 23:05:03 76209 again!!! Are you guys planning to respond or should I just advertise in all crypto groups you guys never respond and to never use your wallet unless you want to lose money and have it disappear from the wallet!!!
This is last chance! Tomorrow is your deadline!!
877 2018-01-03 23:04:57 i agree with both of the above, but again, please show me something that reconciles market cap with price? it's barely true in stocks, less so in crypto, imo. (just bc everyone uses it, doesn't make it right) coingecko offers better analysis w mcap*liquidity*dev*comm*pub interest

887 2018-01-03 23:04:11 Nice, id like to see $pink back in the 1,000+ sats range. That would make me a very happy man haha
888 2018-01-03 23:04:10 It absolutely can absorb through the skin but if the lotion is pure CBD then you will not get high in any way. I use CBD lotion for back pain
889 2018-01-03 23:04:09 That's part of the risk profile for KCS (for me at least) so when I bought it I also expected to keep it on the exchange.
890 2018-01-03 23:04:06 Sir when moon?
891 2018-01-03 23:04:06 You would have to soak it in for like a day and use major amounts...  as they only put a very small amount in the loation.
892 2018-01-03 23:04:05 Advice to all so called Crypto Gurus. STOP calling coins “shares”. They are not stocks nor equity instruments. You lose all credibility. #DoBetter #Cryptocurency #bitcoin #etherium #litecoin #beyourbestself #notes
893 2018-01-03 23:04:04 Did that and it was the biggest mistake I've done since joined crypto. Learnt my lesson
894 2018-01-03 23:04:04 This is funny.
895 2018-01-03 23:04:00 Huh?  Crypto doesn’t MAKE money, it transfers money.
896 2018-01-03 23:03:58 Go easy if you're a noob to this. It can take a while to metabolize through your liver than you'll be on the moon. Isn't like smoking
897 2018-01-03 23:03:56 lol no my friend.
no one ever died in the history of mankind of marijuana

901 2018-01-03 23:03:39 He looks back on that day, thinking about how he had the $20 in his pocket, but said fucking lets go crypto!
902 2018-01-03 23:03:38 Shit Conneeeeect! your call is coming through again! I was expecting it to blast off between the 30th and the 1st.
903 2018-01-03 23:03:34 Crypto is here to stay and change everybody's life in 2020-2030. BTC will make banks obsolete. 
$NEO has direct business and continue to grow. It is a smart eco system. $NEO dApps will be working together. 

Do not know about ADA. Seems 1 year behind $NEO, no business.
904 2018-01-03 23:03:32 Merci pour l'info ;) c'est justement ça qui est sympa à suivre... Monsieur tout le monde qui met x euro dans la crypto. Il me semble pas qu'il est non plus "goûteur" de bière professionnel ou inspecteur du guide Michelin, pourtant je trouve sympa ses dégustations
905 2018-01-03 23:03:28 Well I just the label and it’s THC in it too but that’s not what I wanted
906 2018-01-03 23:03:21 The next crypto that can full your pocket, it's this one i think , i am in ;)
907 2018-01-03 23:03:19 $bch is dying @cad_crypto ... sad day in the neighborhood...even Bitcoin Cash liked this.
908 2018-01-03 23:03:19 If y'all just hadn't screwed over the crypto currency laws, thinking you're going to close "loopholes". Banksters always get theirs in, don't they?
909 2018-01-03 23:03:15 when evaluating alt-coins remember: Nakomoto consensus was chosen for a reason. many consensus mechanisms powering other "cryptos" have serious vulnerabilities and attack vectors that are not only theoretical but possible for well funded actors to exploit

931 2018-01-03 23:01:54 yes
932 2018-01-03 23:01:54 Really wondering where the hell this action is coming from. I got my sells at 15000 so I can get out
933 2018-01-03 23:01:46 Yes 100% if it’s properly prepared.

935 2018-01-03 23:01:45 Someone should open a crypto school to teach basic investment strategies and tricks for newbs, I'd sign up.
936 2018-01-03 23:01:38 huh?  You don't think crypto is going to grow over the next two years?
937 2018-01-03 23:01:37 @moki_sparrow can 
938 2018-01-03 23:01:32 Oh that hindsight :0
939 2018-01-03 23:01:25 Yes! Particularly more so on the cbd front, rather than thc but technically you could get high through your skin too if it was made into a lotion
940 2018-01-03 23:01:23 I just don't understand crypto kitties.

942 2018-01-03 23:01:21 I just love the crypto community. So many great people. I want to see btc hit the moon. Some of the alts are pretty great too but I think Andreas was right. Most of them are absolute shit bit we need that to get where we are heading. Cheers mate!

946 2018-01-03 23:01:14 This article doesn’t answer the question though? I’m interested in knowing whether the ledger is obfuscated. Are the transaction amounts hidden as with ZCoin and Monero? @justinvendetta

952 2018-01-03 23:01:00 So many alts that mooned last year have this chart. Pretty much scalping time before next run 2018
953 2018-01-03 23:00:58 Cannot od.... in fact most topicals are extremely low micro dosage that create more of a slight body high than a detectable cerebral high
954 2018-01-03 23:00:54 yep, transdermal absorption is a thing
955 2018-01-03 23:00:50 You can't get 'high' from topicals, at least as far as I know
956 2018-01-03 23:00:44 I just realized that I've been confusing Gavin Andresen with Marc Andreessen of Netflix fame - DOH! I'm gonna lay off the White Russians today ...
At least I was involved with the internet boom, back in the 90's, so I have *some* excuse. LOL!

974 2018-01-03 22:59:29 Hey mate. I’m very new to Crypto, investing ever, but was given a tip a couple of days ago from a successful crypto millionaire saying SUB is a sleeping giant. What price do you see this hitting in the near future. Cheers 
975 2018-01-03 22:59:29 Let's talk about crypto currency & chill.
976 2018-01-03 22:59:24 Lot's of people freaking out at this stage of #crypto. Never had such a globally accessible mkt before this. I couldn't have invested in the .com bubble from my country even if I wanted. All can now though, coz cross border. Of course it's a bubble, but it isn't bursting yet #btc

982 2018-01-03 22:59:08 Crypto has kept me sane these past few months 
983 2018-01-03 22:59:05 Try to observe the whole situation, even when you invested money. Because it has so many different perspectives and it really plays with your mind as well. Learn from it and grow your crypto wisdom because it's just getting started. #cryptoworldwide
984 2018-01-03 22:59:05 You misspelled #Nexus $NXS

987 2018-01-03 22:58:55 Can someone that’s a marijuana expert please tell me if that shit can absorb through your skin if it’s a lotion?
988 2018-01-03 22:58:51 I am very familiar but sometimes crypto moves up so fast you have to update your trailing stop loss frequently, or else you get rekt selling near the bottom instead of the tip.
989 2018-01-03 22:58:47 It is very interesting to note the crypto coin calls by @officialmcafee always increase because of a lot of research which goes into his work before naming any coin. Kudos!!! This is awesome.

991 2018-01-03 22:58:41 Yea you can watch the trx/btc and when that makes sense just make the move in eth
992 2018-01-03 22:58:40 I see the point,  but i always thought crypto as more "short game" due to volatility.

Neo definitely looks good from what ice checked. 
Thoughts on ADA?

1. #bitcoin = $500,000 = one brick of gold (SoV)
2. #ethereum = $2,000 = one month's living expenses (MoE)
3. #xrp #ripple = $20 = one small crack rock
995 2018-01-03 22:58:28 Ripple scales horizontally so is capable of a lot more but I don’t know a lot about Railblocks although I only hear good things.
996 2018-01-03 22:58:23 I will gladly buy it from you.
997 2018-01-03 22:58:14 Yes I bought in ETH because it's quicker and cheaper, but no one would understand if I said I bought at 4713 Kwei

1002 2018-01-03 22:57:56 Edibles come on slower but can be more potent. I believe the usual recommended dose for the occasional user is 10 mg. But everyone's different.
1003 2018-01-03 22:57:50 Crypto isn't so much a bubble...i see it more as a bubbly foam that you can shape into different forms.... :)

1011 2018-01-03 22:57:27 The only valuable crypto that exists is $BTC and it comes without a CEO. Nor does it come with a marketing team.

1026 2018-01-03 22:56:02 Sadly true. But ignorance is also buy a credit swap or a complex financial instrument without knowing anything about it. Thats everywhere and thats how ppl lose money not only in #crypto
1027 2018-01-03 22:55:59 Yeah..   can't log on to Binance, but CoinMarketCap tells me that $TRX is still a BEAST at almost 9 cents..      #TRONMODE      First time I've seen  Binance have a problem loading up..    #CRYPTO
1028 2018-01-03 22:55:53 It's not hard to make money in crypto. The true test is NOT losing what you make. Gotta take profits, I don't care how much you think your coin is going to to the moon, take profits. (The best way to get more of your moon coin if you wish)

1038 2018-01-03 22:54:51 yeah 14mg per gummy, 2 gummies should be well mor ethan enough for someone less than 200 lbs.

1050 2018-01-03 22:54:07 @officialmcafee pump it!
1051 2018-01-03 22:54:06 A reminder to crypto investors who want to play capitalists for a few years. Stop investing to make / protect money. Invest in things you believe need funding. This will also offer the best returns in the long-term. 
1052 2018-01-03 22:54:04 Is that a new crypto?

1056 2018-01-03 22:53:52 Oh seriously ?
1057 2018-01-03 22:53:49 The issue is...this coin would have 90% less holders if it came out in the state its in. And who the hell is @Crypto_Xchange anyway? Since dropping lending, why are they still anonymous? Wheres the team? No exchange wants to deal with them. Lol
1058 2018-01-03 22:53:48 Oh okay then. You're deeply invested in crypto because you believe in ideals, right? You don't care about the money, right?
1059 2018-01-03 22:53:43 Crypto trades more simplistic. The amount of breaks to the upside that do not fail is far higher then forex, stocks etc
1060 2018-01-03 22:53:43 I agree no one knows the crypto flight path but writing off all technologies other than BTC as whim and fancy when it is looking like there are some that may actually be impactful and are, in fact, affecting the price of BTC isn’t helping anyone.

1072 2018-01-03 22:53:14 You're right ripple is a risky investment. It has a lot of hype surrounding it which is bumping up the price. Also a lot of unrealistic predictions for the coin i dont think it will surpass $10 and it could potentially crash afterwards.
1073 2018-01-03 22:53:12 Wait aren't those suppose to be suppositories?

1076 2018-01-03 22:53:02 What a cunt.
1077 2018-01-03 22:52:56 Yeah, I guess the "trolling" part is what I dont understand. Doesn't seem logical or beneficial to the crypto community. But if you enjoy doing it, troll away. I just hope people don't listen.
1078 2018-01-03 22:52:56 Why you think so?
1079 2018-01-03 22:52:56 Yea only thing is when Asian gets up they’ll prolly take some morning profits before settling the price more throughout the day
1080 2018-01-03 22:52:54 Wow! This is gonna be huge.
1081 2018-01-03 22:52:51 Thank you and I'm sure 2018 will be the year of crypto world!
1082 2018-01-03 22:52:49 Banks are not looking to hold client funds in volatile assets. 

If a crypto can rise over 25% in a day. It can also depreciate 25% in a day. 

I am a firm believer in Ripple, but I believe the asset is over valued atm.
1083 2018-01-03 22:52:45 So this is happening? MSM is going to def pick it up now.
let them shill #Crypto for us 
1084 2018-01-03 22:52:43 3mg is not very much but still be careful they take a bit to kick in .Up to an hour or so. Colorado the max per serving is 10 .

1104 2018-01-03 22:51:10 du meinst eher Mr. Crypto
1105 2018-01-03 22:51:08 I also know 80% of all start ups fail. So the minimum alt coins to fail will be 80%.I would believe this number to be muc higher for crypto
1106 2018-01-03 22:51:06 It's showing steady growth and not really pumping. I would wait to see what happens at resistance since it's near that. But if you're going to hodl then it will bring great returns in the long run

1115 2018-01-03 22:50:40 Well it seems like there's a lot more risk. They basically have a very very narrow set of potential future customers (large banks). And if they don't adopt XRP doesn't that imply the token should go to zero?
1116 2018-01-03 22:50:37 Satoshis since most people trade altcoins in bitcoin so one trx is .00000605 bitcoins right now so 605 satoshis

1134 2018-01-03 22:49:39 I'd like to get into Ripple. I've told other too, long before this crypto rally, sadly, as of yet, I've not had enough expendable savings during bullish crypto runs to do so
1135 2018-01-03 22:49:38 worried that $xrp might be the first lesson in overvalued #crypto projects of 2018. this won't be candyland forever...  #bitcoin
1136 2018-01-03 22:49:29 Could it be that the recent success of centralized shitcoins has to do with mainstream media being the top information source for newcomers vs. #Crypto OGs previously?

1147 2018-01-03 22:48:37 I also dipped into some #XVG at 900 sats I think the coin definitely has the potential to do great things, all FUD and ridiculous marketing ploys aside. The tech side to it is definitely an innovative addition to Crypto. Get onto#Wraith and try it yourself to truly appreciate.
1148 2018-01-03 22:48:30 Those gummies are weak as shit...probably only 10mg...You need 100mg and you'll feel it in about 30-45min
1149 2018-01-03 22:48:27 Lbc was the biggest thing going when I first got started with cyrptos. Great idea but their blockchain is based on Bitcoin code so I seriously doubt it will scale and be fast enough
1150 2018-01-03 22:48:24 It’s fine. This is a shitpost account. Either way , I noticed you put a picture of alll those foreign (developing nation) banks. Goldman Sachs for example is forecasting growth in 2018 in developing nations . I wonder if a crypto who is targeting that market may be profitable 
1151 2018-01-03 22:48:22 no crypto under 18

1154 2018-01-03 22:48:03 Aaaan thats why people don't trust crypto... slow clap
1155 2018-01-03 22:48:03 @nivertech I'm confused on your stance on crypto. You name clearly states that you are for crypto yet you retweet information that counters that? I appreciate opinions as it's not sensible to only view something from your own opinion and your opinion only.
1156 2018-01-03 22:48:01 Keep the crypto tweets coming

I understand that exchanges can’t change their fee schedule on a whim, but try to keep up

1202 2018-01-03 22:46:14 600 sats is high but also not a long term bad investment but should see a dip
1203 2018-01-03 22:46:08 What if you don’t have crypto currency but want to invest?
1204 2018-01-03 22:46:05 Dipesh, he is just trying to make you emotional, irrational, & insecure. I see it all over twitter.

1214 2018-01-03 22:45:09 @KTechSystemsLtd I love Money Tracker for Win 10/Win Phone, great work! It's a niche use, but it'd be really nice if it was possible to add custom (base) currencies, so I could keep track of less popular altcoins that aren't on the included crypto currencies.
1215 2018-01-03 22:44:58 lol I dig it I bought it at 1sat when I was new crypto bought all the cheap now I know better hahahah thx this coin did me well sold at the top
1216 2018-01-03 22:44:58 True that, but it is from where I got it. What’s a few days in crypto-world?

1228 2018-01-03 22:44:01 Too many people buy on FOMO, then blame other people for it. If something has already launched I don't buy because I've seen the end result. First rule should be don't buy on FOMO and if you buy in after 1000% in 10 days you're asking for trouble

1231 2018-01-03 22:43:52 So crypto is bad because it’s not controlled by a government? This obviously has nothing to do with religion. Shameful to lead your sheep astray.
1232 2018-01-03 22:43:51 Ripple is the anti crypto coin.
1233 2018-01-03 22:43:50 In hindsight it's quite possible that this crypto-islamist did it on purpose.
1234 2018-01-03 22:43:46 Congrats and a great job done rand! Keep up the good work!
1235 2018-01-03 22:43:39 That’s a ridiculous statement. Doge just popped from 17 sat to well over 60

I mean, thats LITERALLY what @altcoinmogul is doing in that EXACT tweet! So ironic. I mean, IS that McAfee?

1242 2018-01-03 22:43:21 Ripple is partnered with many banks.
1243 2018-01-03 22:43:11 It’s mind blowing that some people think the price of a coin/ stock matters.  Do you think they all started at $0 and the higher priced ones are winning the race to infinity? Look at the god damn market caps. #crypto $btc #trading

1278 2018-01-03 22:40:57 Crypto prices are sky-high because internet-money is the first truly global asset class. Bubbles like dotcom or housing were concentrated in US.

1313 2018-01-03 22:39:34 My main focus is ICO's, after speaking with some 8 and 9 figure earners in the crypto space and being told all they do is buy ICO's left and right and sell many at 10-100x usually, I decided to go that route. I got a VERY good ICO project I found today that I will be sharing soon
1314 2018-01-03 22:39:32 Nope, most say Ripple is the main pump currently, do you even realize what 2 rumors has started these gains? I am willing to bet both are shot down on 1/8 when its supposed to happen. Again there is a reason why its being so centralized thats the opposite of why crypto is here.

1358 2018-01-03 22:37:12 Dude. Like, 3% of the world are savvy in crypto n by the time it reaches even 4% the fud on verge will be dead. Wraith will be an amazing privacy coin option and a whole new buyers market ar that point will buy buy buy.
1359 2018-01-03 22:37:06 Oh wise crypto savant. What’s up with BCN. How are they sitting on a 1B market cap?
1360 2018-01-03 22:37:02 #Genesis Vision is much better with enormous potential.
1361 2018-01-03 22:36:53 I don't know. No one can know for sure. But DragonChain as an organization is very professional and seem to know how to work in an enterprise state of mind. Won't take long, my friend. :)

1371 2018-01-03 22:36:25 As crypto world grows, I find that exchanges are being overloaded more often...the systems are clogged and its hard to be nimble. I could see this being a growing pattern.
1372 2018-01-03 22:36:23 How would a decentralised fiat/crypto exchange work beyond the OTC use case?

1375 2018-01-03 22:36:09 So this happened: camera had a problem when I was driving the Ferrari, it got the video but it didn't record the sound. Fuck. Will post it anyway. Good part is the manager offered me another ride for free. Will go back there this month maybe ^^

Did you take the bins out?
1391 2018-01-03 22:35:36 what exchange sir ?
1392 2018-01-03 22:35:30 Crypto as a technology is super important, much less as an asset class or investment vehicle. Sad to see folks poor borrowed money into something so volatile purely out of hopes of financial gain. Invest in understanding the world- EDU, AR, ML, & H20 are the currencies of today
1393 2018-01-03 22:35:30 Yea ima jump back in on the decline my money just sitting on the crypto exchange I’m ready to unload this shit
1394 2018-01-03 22:35:29 Damn it! Missing out on crypto bags by the second lol
1395 2018-01-03 22:35:27 can you point to one crypto that isn't priced on speculation?
1396 2018-01-03 22:35:27 Exactly! I’ve been so ridiculously excited about the crypto space. It’s giving me the same feels the SEO space did when I got started. :)
1397 2018-01-03 22:35:26 well mate people who get burned because of listening to these clowns deserve it. Invest in what you believe and do your own leg work. Don't ever get investment advice on social media. Agree?

1402 2018-01-03 22:35:06 @CryptoChoe What should you do? I have 8.2K Tron. Should I sell it and buy other crypto's? keep it? if so for how long?
1403 2018-01-03 22:34:57 This is correct.

1408 2018-01-03 22:34:43 people are keep calling ripple (xrp) a shitcoin, why don't y'all make a better crypto currency then, than just sit in your couch and talk shit about ripple. Atleast they're revolutionizing the bank system. decentralized or not!
1409 2018-01-03 22:34:37 600 sats right now!
1410 2018-01-03 22:34:30 Yep but nothing like moving away from banks into crypto world only to invest in the largest bank owned crypto and using btc/ltc/eth to buy it. Sometimes you need to read into a bit.
1411 2018-01-03 22:34:26 With an overbought equities market, watch sophisticated investors move to crypto in a flight to safety model and away from the traditional gold hedge. You typically don’t take delivery, really can’t build, eat or even conduct electricity with it.And u can’t really purchase goods.
1412 2018-01-03 22:34:22 Do we have any other option but to wait? I’m seeing people waiting more than 15 days with no deposit! Never put what you can’t lose in crypto

1426 2018-01-03 22:33:15 Thanksss man!
1427 2018-01-03 22:33:10 Are you talking about that coin you can never withdraw for real dollars?
1428 2018-01-03 22:33:09 They sound like an interesting company that is trying to do a bit of everything. Can you explain the use case for their tokens and why they are needed?

1432 2018-01-03 22:32:49 whats the problem with Binance ?
1433 2018-01-03 22:32:46 Please people be careful with how much you invest in ripple. I don't like seeing people get rekt. This thing is bad for crypto, bad for humanity and bad for investors. The only thing it's good for is recentralising wealth just like the central banking cartels today.
1434 2018-01-03 22:32:44 Same here im trying to find a news about it
1435 2018-01-03 22:32:39 Yoooooouuuuu aaaaare the wiiiiiind beneath my wiiiiiiiings
1436 2018-01-03 22:32:35 Thanks a lot 
1437 2018-01-03 22:32:35 definitely bout it, ive been thinking of having a GC about crypto it’ll be super productive if everyone is really trying to prosper.
1438 2018-01-03 22:32:32 Watch for MTH and BMC as well. Both of which you are very much familiar with.
1439 2018-01-03 22:32:30 My problem is the time. I must focus my energy on bitgrail right now
1440 2018-01-03 22:32:28 If its true that 2 exchanges are about to add #xrp $xrp one being #coinbase. This coin is about to go nuts. The rumor is #Binance has shut down due to the possible influx of buy orders for xrp

1444 2018-01-03 22:32:26 That's insane, glad for you bro! I kinda missed the crypto trains, if you ever feel like helping a bro out 
1445 2018-01-03 22:32:24 Do you understand what crypto actually represents?
1446 2018-01-03 22:32:24 Lmao
1447 2018-01-03 22:32:17 How many times am I going to see this joke today?

1451 2018-01-03 22:32:08 I've been hearing rumours of $PYPL #PAYPAL acquiring #Coinbase end of this yr. Why?
@PayPal can fulfill its destiny of becoming the digital bank of the future by positioning itself as a leader in crypto-currencies with the acquisition. Thus bigger growth for #bitcoin & alt coins

1462 2018-01-03 22:31:36 Crypto is so volatile man.  When I get up like $6k to $7k I'm walking away for good...

1464 2018-01-03 22:31:30 TRX broke the $1B Volume yesterday and is still running. If it breaks resistance at $0.10 watch out.

1466 2018-01-03 22:31:18 Crypto gives you all he feels.
1467 2018-01-03 22:31:15 What exchange are you using to get $DIVX?
1468 2018-01-03 22:31:15 Whilst others rave of crypto currency....I’ve already won the new year, by investing in white out for the 1st quarter of 2018. You’re welcome.
1469 2018-01-03 22:31:13 I'm pretty confident that if governments tried to crush $crypto, it would only make the tech behind it stronger, e.g. with decentralized exchanges.
1470 2018-01-03 22:31:07 grow it

1475 2018-01-03 22:30:55 Also they've built solidly and slowly for 5 years now honing the tech and building partnerships. Crypto is hitting mainstream now so it's a perfect storm with a new year and new interest. $XRP
1476 2018-01-03 22:30:45 That is precisely what I mean. What is legit? XRP? is it a legit crypto project? What about Bitconnect? Or any of the projects worth tens and hundreds of millions of dollars with no working code. What about Litecoin, Monero, Decred, and a few others?
1477 2018-01-03 22:30:44 And as we see some substance in apps more and more people will use crypto. Fiat will become obsolete.
1478 2018-01-03 22:30:39 Apparently a guy in my last office invested $80k in Ripple when it was 20 cents. It's now over $2.70.

This would be the second crypto millionaire I know.

1496 2018-01-03 22:29:37 It's pretty interesting how many SEOs are into crypto/forex/general investing. I think it's because of the technical and creative sides of our brains collide.

1514 2018-01-03 22:28:34 Lol, y'all need to chill out big time. It's probably the best exchange their is. and your in Crypto
1515 2018-01-03 22:28:31 When did the scaling problems occur? If you're referring to the shitty exchanges going down, that has nothing to do with #XRB. If binance or coinbase went down, would it be the alt coins and bitcoins fault? The whole point of XRB was too solve the scaling issues.
1516 2018-01-03 22:28:25 Crypto Made Me Over $400 In The Last 24 Hours....Wyd
1517 2018-01-03 22:28:24 I can throw some money at it if its good. Which I believe you are capable of making something great so just let me know.
1518 2018-01-03 22:28:24 omg, haha, now I have a better one!  Hey, where did it go!?? I loved that one! @ChunksCrypto
1519 2018-01-03 22:28:22 I'm not sure. Thinking it's the influx of users wanting to invest because of news around XRP and othe rmainstream crypto, and maybe infrastructure is struggling. Bittrex closed new regs a few weeks ago to upgrade/handle the influx.
1520 2018-01-03 22:28:22 If you insult us as Arabs. Do not forget that we fear the whole world. We do not care about money more than our dignity. That is why we want the money you stole from us. Head of Manfred and Andreas. And we will reach him. Concluded speech
1521 2018-01-03 22:28:15 Does this mean Ripple up??

1523 2018-01-03 22:27:56 Agree. Until $XRP is endorsed by a bank, its hype. If it were legitimised a medium for transfer it subsequently becomes a currency.
1524 2018-01-03 22:27:51 Its a shame that someting that can change the world like crypto is plague with people that only care about how much money they make.
1525 2018-01-03 22:27:45 What happened to his account?
1526 2018-01-03 22:27:44 Oh no... not again
1527 2018-01-03 22:27:42 I love the philosophy of low supply proof of stake. I’ve been crushing it lately. Good job spreading truth @CryptoSave

1533 2018-01-03 22:27:09 They made some major mistakes the running of the project was a total shitshow I sold my position on New Year's Eve when it was at $0.23 it's going to take them awhile to earn the trust of the community again maybe I'll think about buying back in at a later date
1534 2018-01-03 22:27:08 Im not a fan either of XVG Whale, its spammy and over the top... they need a quality spokesman and PR specialist to prevent other publicity fiascos. I just hate to see that people forget what a top notch coin it is
1535 2018-01-03 22:27:07 It's a lot of things. Definitely a lot of media attention now after rumours of big partnerships as well as coinbase. @Ripple are a serious set up with the top team in crypto. $XRP is an amazing coin.
1536 2018-01-03 22:27:07 Will This be the end of crypto? When Its hacked?
1537 2018-01-03 22:27:00 Crypto currency traders are beginning to annoy me as much as vegans.

1582 2018-01-03 22:23:57 Expect to see more banks cutting off wires to crypto exchanges and suspect platforms. This is not their bubble. You deal with it cryptobug.
1583 2018-01-03 22:23:54 How many crypto questions do you get from friends & family members on a daily basis?
1584 2018-01-03 22:23:50 I’m not going to pretend like I’m an expert just because I’m making money in crypto, because I’m not.  But I don’t think BTC rise will tank Alts like it used to.  Trillions are beginning to flood in, that money is gonna go everywhere in crypto

1617 2018-01-03 22:21:28 Hardly. That money is already active elsewhere. For instance, $mint went 3x while ripple did another 50% or so.
1618 2018-01-03 22:21:25 Passive indexing is a fallacy because the companies change. Not enough people realize this. Will be important when crypto indexes are Introduced.

1666 2018-01-03 22:16:51 I'd argue that at the moment, far more crypto is lost by people not correctly understanding what they were doing (like sending to an attacker) than having their keys stolen, so at the moment, I side with the more readable txs.
1667 2018-01-03 22:16:42 This is amazing. Pure class!
1668 2018-01-03 22:16:39 Ripple is doing great but 55% escrowed? umm
1669 2018-01-03 22:16:38 Dude get into crypto it’s an opportunity in a lifetime. It’s broken traditional market borders
1670 2018-01-03 22:16:33 Hi, I make a living playing online slots from home and have just entered the crypto space also. I'll be posting my progress regularly, follow my journey and feel free to ask me any questions. #slots #casino #winfromhome #winathome #crypto #winning #financialfreedom #myfirstTweet
1671 2018-01-03 22:16:32 That’s exactly what we said tonight @Adien! XRP faster and cheap as chips. By now we all know what the numbers are when comparing their fees and transfer times. Simply a no-brainer that it should be the new standard for crypto currency pairing!
1672 2018-01-03 22:16:29 Crypto the future catch up now or find out later.
1673 2018-01-03 22:16:27 Unpopular opinion:  if you speculate on a crypto that you know is a scam, you're morally complicit with the scam.
1674 2018-01-03 22:16:25 Enough crypto currency babling, back to coding for @InspicioReviews (Will I dare to say that new interface will be there before the 20th of January ?)
1675 2018-01-03 22:16:25 SEC mixes message on Apple shareholder proposals, activists say #money #is #king #crypto or #fiat
1676 2018-01-03 22:16:22 I’m sorry, but the whole point of cryptos was never for investors to make a buck. The whole point is avoiding a centralized, thus corruptible entity to manage an inadequate amount of capital, and in doing so, protecting a damn critical layer of modern society from being hijacked.
1677 2018-01-03 22:16:21 Show me the crypto 
1678 2018-01-03 22:16:15 BTC in particular!!

1682 2018-01-03 22:16:05 Belle intervention et sujet passionnant !
1683 2018-01-03 22:16:05 Nice call. I remember you talking about it a couple months ago while I was looking for new masternode coins. Didn’t pull the trigger bc it didn’t have Mac wallet. Bout to go back and punch myself in the face. Congrats!
1684 2018-01-03 22:16:01 Just awesome, man!

1687 2018-01-03 22:15:45 @eToro are you planning on adding Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), NEM (XEM), Iota (MIOTA) etc to your platform? These are up and coming Crypto’s and we want to trade them. Thanks.
1688 2018-01-03 22:15:43 It's not even a trust what lead mostly people in #crypto these days, but pure greed.
1689 2018-01-03 22:15:42 Another great person to follow on twitter is @360_trader if you want great #cryptocurrency advise. He has been on point with many coins

1695 2018-01-03 22:15:17 @carterthomas I’m 24 & trying 2 use the crypto frenzy to pay off my student loans. I bought one type of crypto, waited until it almost double and retrieved my initial investment as to not lose money. What guidelines/factors should I follow in determining when to sell the rest?
1696 2018-01-03 22:15:16 You’re kidding me! Oh my goodness, there was me thinking it was the actual Warren Buffett and has been tweeting about crypto. Thank goodness for people like yourself being able to call such madness.

1700 2018-01-03 22:15:04 Yeah, I hear ya. Owned XRP at $1, XLM at .40, and AION a few days before it doubled but was just hoping to do it til I got to a point where I could buy a decent amount of something. But sounds like I already missed 100-200% returns trading 2 much lol. Still learning, thx 4 advice

1705 2018-01-03 22:14:41 Cool. And to answer your question, yes I do feel like I’m plugging back in the matrix when I rejoin society. The crypto world is more real than the real world. You should check out the book Simulacra and Simukation, which the movie is influenced by. Neo owns it in the first movie
1706 2018-01-03 22:14:41 Bitcoin is just a small part of blockchain. Rather focus on bitcoin they need to focus on blockchain

Also some scholars i see have issued fatwas with no knowledge of crypto and have just assumed
1707 2018-01-03 22:14:36 I will buy some power soon. missed ada. bought 3000 xlm at .20  but I will invest in ada soon after correction
1708 2018-01-03 22:14:30 best thing to do is start small then if crazies want to buy it even higher you arn't outa the game. Not as much potential profits as an all in but wayyy safer.

1710 2018-01-03 22:14:24 Oh - you are doing me a favor? Interesting... What if I WERE really pumping it, as opposed to simply trying to share it. If you are so concerned for MY money, it is SO STRANGE to me that u would attempt to do me "a favor" by trying to DEVALUE my financial asset? Very odd indeed.

1715 2018-01-03 22:13:43 We do not need a magazine, blog or “Best Of Crypto” editorial to tell us what matters. 9 years ago today the most potent editorial was hidden in the Genesis block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The medium is the message: Code not hype.
1716 2018-01-03 22:13:39 You are freakin awesome Ian, keep it up!
1717 2018-01-03 22:13:34 Ignore this Hater
1718 2018-01-03 22:13:32 I’m def with it that’s how I am with my boy started the yr talking forex and penny stocks now it’s crypto every day  been plotting since last yr to take this yr over lol but I’m def with it need to surround myself with more like minded ppl
1719 2018-01-03 22:13:30 I say quite the opposite. When others are trend chasing you counter-trade that bad investment strategy.
1720 2018-01-03 22:13:29 Arbitrage should have a pretty similar effect anyway. I pretty much got my hands full just trying to stay on top of Bittrex BTC markets, Id suggest compare the charts and if they are similar and coin is available on binance, copy the trade anyway.
1721 2018-01-03 22:13:29 Very curious to see if you suspicions are true. I have no skin in the game, but I don't have faith in the product which is why i didn't invest.
1722 2018-01-03 22:13:28 In the last month alone, more services have popped up around crypto tax and portfolio management than the entire year. The multi altcoin future that I thought was years away now seems closer than ever

1727 2018-01-03 22:13:00 Anything is possible in crypto take a look at XLM

1729 2018-01-03 22:12:54 it actually does work. plus I bought it long long ago so I will hold. xvgwhale is a clown. let the finish . There are videos from devs who worked on the project over the New Years on youtube. Interviews and such.
1730 2018-01-03 22:12:50 Thank you for your suggestion. I really do value your input! I think you’re 100% right. I’m going to HODL and invest new money into the low costing crypto. You haven’t steered us wrong. 
1731 2018-01-03 22:12:48 Hoy hace 4 años que hice la primera compra de crypto....
1732 2018-01-03 22:12:41 @CryptoMessiah I'll play. Need some crypto follows too.
1733 2018-01-03 22:12:26 I think it is being pumped. I think the tech behind ripple is good, but not THAT good and not so much better than other coins. Hard to predict anything in the crypto world so who knows how high it will go and what the new base will be.
1734 2018-01-03 22:12:07 +1 to that
1735 2018-01-03 22:12:02 I luvs it see!
1736 2018-01-03 22:11:46 Stay away from crypto
1737 2018-01-03 22:11:43 In the beginning the demand for crypto was a demand for decentralization but we are at the point where a wave of money is flooding in and 90% of it (institutional or retail) is dumb money that does not understand what it's all about.  It all looks like a great deal...

Its great that you help out the community but #verge is not a scam so its not really fair to spread incorrect info. People are just angry because of the missed deadlines, thats all
1749 2018-01-03 22:10:55 Most ppl in Canada who want to move any significant money into crypto can’t do it thru Coinbase (only CC payments and very low limits) so we are forced to use Canadian exchanges first and then move to buy on different exchanges. This would be big news for $XRP

1803 2018-01-03 22:07:23 Happy B-Day #bitcoin. You’re still the King of the Crypto Market, but the new players are coming strong. Welcome to the big league #Ripple #Cardano and #Stellar. Play nice
1804 2018-01-03 22:07:16 The fact that people are still putting money into $CTR despite its founders basically being exposed as borderline frauds shows a huge problem in the crypto space.
1805 2018-01-03 22:07:13 Man, if you were annoyed at the crypto talk in 2017, you are not in for a good time this year. Ignore the self-proclaimed "bitcoin millionaires" and educate yourself on the blockchain technology and crypto as a whole. Finance is evolving - adapt.
1806 2018-01-03 22:07:09 Bittrex - I rarely call other exchanges.... for now anyway, maybe down the track I might.
1807 2018-01-03 22:07:09 think ima cave nd walk into the crypto world
1808 2018-01-03 22:06:53 That's it, more of this attitude from this space is welcome!
1809 2018-01-03 22:06:46 The FUD against XRP is of no consequence at all. It doesn't change the vision of @Ripple and what they are trying to achieve....
1810 2018-01-03 22:06:44 Don’t even try to apply for external exchanges. Just start internal exchange and start listing other coins. Look at KuCoin
1811 2018-01-03 22:06:43 AMEN. Crypto life is the only life.
1812 2018-01-03 22:06:40 this was what i was wondering also. I have coins like trx, ada, omg, dgb, doge etc so I'm not sure how to store these coins in a wallet..if I am holding, then i have to leave it on binance or poloniex right?
1813 2018-01-03 22:06:39 I wish be the winner in next 5hr!!! :)
1814 2018-01-03 22:06:38 Its working kinda nice for me

The friends who abandoned me when I got laid-off from my job... some wanna be my friends again.

What a life! The power of crypto

1821 2018-01-03 22:06:13 It is not a bot. I would NEVER expect anyone to install random programs or scripts on their computer as they could be malicious & an attempt to steal crypto/information. As you can see though, my system certainly works. I have a bunch of people making money with me. DM me! :)
1822 2018-01-03 22:06:09 Whenever anyone says ‘xyz country or abc bank gonna create their own crypto,’ I always say - it exists, it’s called Ripple. Surprised it took them so long to figure this out. by #thomaspower
1823 2018-01-03 22:06:07 We needa link one day and talk crypto lol
1824 2018-01-03 22:06:03 Had the best dinner with @cryptomanran in Plettenberg Bay tonight, always good to spend a few hours talking about crypto:)
1825 2018-01-03 22:06:00 Awesome initiative! You have a great heart
1826 2018-01-03 22:05:51 We may never know. One thing is for sure, the crypto train will be bigger than ever before. We are witnessing history.
1827 2018-01-03 22:05:43 I'm setting myself a challenge to start with 30 quid and see whether I can turn it into a grand in a few months. Fingers crossed!!

1832 2018-01-03 22:05:24 The internet is a quickly becoming a way to extract wealth, however, getting it back into fiat for everyday use can vary widely. 

Bank deposit:
Coinbase - 1 Day
Paypal - 3 Days

Crypto companies are setting the bar high these days.

1837 2018-01-03 22:05:05 first of all - great channel !!  my question: everywhere you see videos on how to deposit money etc. - but, what is in your opinion the safest way to get the money back to your bank account? withdraw in pieces? all in one? btc or what other currency? thanks in advance
1838 2018-01-03 22:04:58 おはようございまる
1839 2018-01-03 22:04:50 I'm still hopeful for crypto as well as fintech generally, but a lot you see is just very money-grabbing and meh.
1840 2018-01-03 22:04:48 Why are transfers of Crypto so slllooooooooooooooooowwwwww

1846 2018-01-03 22:04:24 Why are you pretending to be a woman? #RealTalk #AskTheFuehrer
1847 2018-01-03 22:04:24 @DougPolkPoker Where would you recommend to start for a newbie in Crypto if wanting to put some $ to invest?
1848 2018-01-03 22:04:22 I have 8455 units of XRP. Got in back when it was .19cents. Would you suggest I HODL or spread that across the top 10 crypto.
1849 2018-01-03 22:04:16 Day trading is dangerous man. IMHO, I'd ride this out. This could very well pull a $TRX. It's getting a lot of buzz.
1850 2018-01-03 22:04:15 Long as these crypto punters don't take profits in large amounts, we're good. I do NOT want this to be like typical FX
1851 2018-01-03 22:04:12 ぬいぐるみwww
1852 2018-01-03 22:04:07 I’d look at other places to buy - I’ve had a buy stuck in ‘processing’ for nearly 2 full days- missing many key trades. Not good enough and NO communication back
1853 2018-01-03 22:03:56 So what is the best way to hold alt coins without it being on a trading site? thank you for any information
1854 2018-01-03 22:03:56 Hopefully they're not Crypto coins! lol
1855 2018-01-03 22:03:53 I agree
1856 2018-01-03 22:03:48 I just wish online banking institutions would adopt the security measures of crypto sites...
1857 2018-01-03 22:03:44 What does 2018 hold for regular stock exchanges @ASX @NYSE etc with the rise of #crypto? I sold all my #ASX shares and have made more in one month than I did in two years $xrp $eth $btc
1858 2018-01-03 22:03:39 Can someone summarize the new crypto tax for me please? It would be great if someone could do a video explaining it. Thanks #Newb

1860 2018-01-03 22:03:22 Arguing crypto isn't an "investment" doesn't mean one can't make money trading it /thread
1861 2018-01-03 22:03:19 Industrial orgs: Hire as much people as possible. Crypto projects: Keep your team as small as possible and outsource everything you can to your community
1862 2018-01-03 22:03:14 If you’re a musician and need extra capital for your art? Invest in forex and crypto!
1863 2018-01-03 22:03:02 Almost same story here too.. however, unlike you, I worked for 6 years and then lost my job. I was smart to have started investing in crypto back in 2014/15 and luck got on my side. 

More than 1 year today no job, more than 100 rejections. Yet crypto still made me a millionaire.
1864 2018-01-03 22:03:02 Have you gotten into crypto at all?
1865 2018-01-03 22:02:59 Crypto is a wild west, but it also sets a new paradigm for investor participation. For the first time in history the man on the street has access to seed round investment opportunities. Blockchain technology one way or the other will change the investment world as we know it.!
1866 2018-01-03 22:02:59 agreed!

1870 2018-01-03 22:02:46 I really enjoy your tweets! What are your thoughts about Reddcoin?
1871 2018-01-03 22:02:44 Verge can still recover, no doubt. 

But holding Verge over the last few days instead of buying... $XLM or $RDD or $ADA or $XRP or etc, etc. etc. was an extremely costly mistake in terms of real dollars.

Crypto moves very fast.
1872 2018-01-03 22:02:34 You seem very passionate about badmouthing #Verge though. Relax :) invest your energy in positivity, have a beer or something
1873 2018-01-03 22:02:28 I remember one of the Metal investors pooched a lot of people dumping 600,000 $MTL a couple of months ago that previously weren't on the market. Then BTC had a crazy bull run. I think that's out of the ordinary.
1874 2018-01-03 22:02:27 Here’s to truth and beauty.
1875 2018-01-03 22:02:25 because he is, confirmed by Justin himself on discord
1876 2018-01-03 22:02:23 No, no, no. Nobody is interested in your lame crypto currency blockchain startup. 3 days into 2018 and I’m already sick of these bandwagon jumpers.
1877 2018-01-03 22:02:22 i wish thats how easy it was in the crypto world
1878 2018-01-03 22:02:21 1st set on investing in bitcoin , is having a wallet for your crypto coins , a wallet is what holds your percentage of these coins that you own and what value they hold ,  by using my link if you invest $100 or more youll receive $10 worth of bitcoin for free ---> (Next Tweet)

1881 2018-01-03 22:02:09 I'm so deep in the crypto game and literally have no idea what I'm doing lol
1882 2018-01-03 22:01:56 Because he is.
1883 2018-01-03 22:01:53 Crypto will be default black market in those same areas. Crypto is analogous to heroin; anyone having it is a criminal, but it is everywhere.
This is the world William S. Burroughs prepared me to live in.
1884 2018-01-03 22:01:52 Well, the crypto-fintechs: definitely. 
Insurtech: many, mainly data protection/scoring-related compliance and data protection.
Credittech: mostly scoring-related compliance and data protection.
Banking: mostly okay, probably.
Robo-Investing: Meh. Not really start-ups, imo; hyped
1885 2018-01-03 22:01:49 Just saw this! I use binance- much better for the Alt Coins. Colin let's crypto chat and catch up soon! 
1886 2018-01-03 22:01:48 Why? Thinking of selling my stack 
1887 2018-01-03 22:01:27 @MichaelSuppo Check out the low cap, speedy privacy coin XLR (Solaris) with big release this month.  I nearly fell of my chair reading the features on their website.
1888 2018-01-03 22:01:25 Why is there so much organic buzz/talk about crypto currency on my social media rn?

1898 2018-01-03 22:01:01 well, spreadsheet is a working product, too

1901 2018-01-03 22:00:54 Many could tell the same or similar story. While all this money is nice, you say you created 200k jobs? How many of us crypto fanatics can say that? You underestimate what you have done, sir.

1947 2018-01-03 21:57:46 Yes. I would say 1.4% is pretty steep and it hurts sometimes but Crypto to FIAT or to Pound Sterling or Euro or Gold etc... they have a lot of different currencies.

1971 2018-01-03 21:56:21 Can’t get anywhere in life. And now you’ve fell into this little geeky crypto world to make you feel like you have friends. But you don’t have friends and you won’t have friends because you’re socially awkward. You probably haven’t had a relationship last longer than a few weeks.
1972 2018-01-03 21:56:21 Impressed with your work. I will make a small donation of 100$ now. You can mark my tweet, if $trst hits 5$ I will donate 1000$ worth ETH. You can use it for your noble cause. As you are the one who introduced me to that gem. 
1973 2018-01-03 21:56:20 Even while you are fake account, fake picture, and fake name but I respect your tweets as you are telling the truth

1975 2018-01-03 21:56:17 Pot stocks and crypto coins doubling everyday. What the hell is going on...

1977 2018-01-03 21:56:14 Why don’t I care at all about this crypto currency bullshit?  Dumb ass humans.
1978 2018-01-03 21:56:00 How could a coin you need to stake the main coin have a bigger cap that would be bizarro world duh
1979 2018-01-03 21:55:56 $lend is a different product. $Salt loans are from a bank and the $salt coin can be used to pay the loan back at a rate of 27.50 USD. $lend is p2p. Which is also cool and has its place. Crypto isnt one or the other.

1987 2018-01-03 21:55:19 My trading strategy on binance: a) buy cheap coins and wait for them to moon since no one gives a shit about circulating supply or market cap then sell b) find a solid crypto that hasn't mooned in a week and wait. As for b) $NAV $ARK $WTC

1992 2018-01-03 21:54:49 BTC and ETH are like the reserve currency in crypto similar to how the USD is viewed currently, although that title is slowly slipping a way.
1993 2018-01-03 21:54:42 Still can't work out if to trade a chunk of BTC for XRP Ripple.
I know it's just hit $3 and looks like I lost a lot of momentum. But for any serious gains it's going to have to knock Bitcoin off top spot.
That happens and who knows what happens with Crypto.
1994 2018-01-03 21:54:40 Love this !!!
1995 2018-01-03 21:54:39 I think the banks are using #ripple as a disruptive force in the crypto space. Ripple is the agent coin...lol
1996 2018-01-03 21:54:37 Lol I have some of them on my show and social media. Brock pierce. Reeve. Jeremy Gardner. Some don’t want to be public. Makes sense in the world of crypto.
1997 2018-01-03 21:54:35 Think about how big #MOONCoin will be when grocery stores build their shopper rewards program into the coin. This is the advantage of a non-crypto crypto... fastest possible transaction speed, lowest transaction cost, shareable info in each coin!

2008 2018-01-03 21:54:05 I keep trying to explain to people why $XRP can never be $100, let alone $1000, and they just don't get it. At $1000, it would be worth more than the annual GDP of the planet. That's $100 trillion. This is the level of sophistication of investors currently getting into crypto.
2009 2018-01-03 21:54:03 They shouldn't be selling at all.....

2018 2018-01-03 21:53:20 Not bad pero el mundo crypto es una locura. Mira XRB que lleva un 7500% en 1 mes. Mi último pelotazo Request que llevo un 700% en 2 meses. Llevas mucho tiempo metido aquí??

2020 2018-01-03 21:53:15 All I see is a UI lol. Also no one would every type out Nanoseconds.... makes me think this is fake.   Any scientist would use a unit.
2021 2018-01-03 21:53:12 I’ve discovered the #cryptocurrency dilemma. Liking both $ADA & $ETN, but need to put more into $XRP & $ICX (when they dip). Of course, need to also keep feeding the long term plays $XMR, $ETH, & $BTC. #Crypto millionaire thinking without the bank balance to match 
2022 2018-01-03 21:53:12 $XRP is at $122 B market cap.
and.. Some said crypto would mature in 2018.
Oh well!
2023 2018-01-03 21:53:08 I agree 100% everyone is just jumping in trying to find the next bitcoin. The lower the price tag the more they buy it. The new investors are killing the reason this economic sector “crypto currency” was created. They will learn all it takes is one attack on there network.

2046 2018-01-03 21:51:18 Ah ok. Disregard then. My apologies for what you're going through. I hope it wasn't a large sum. In any case, Don't panic yet. I've had transactions stuck for 24 hours and I know how it feels.
2047 2018-01-03 21:51:14 And by ‘getting around sanctions’ you really mean money laundering... lol!!  I love it when clown with invalid arguments prove my point. Crypto stands on its own and does not require anyone’ permission or approval. 
2048 2018-01-03 21:51:14 Based on the above hypothesis ; why doesn't it make sense to shelter your satoshi it makes sense to sell when btc pumps. Then after the pump is done you can buy more alt coin at lower satoshi.
2049 2018-01-03 21:51:13 The only issue I see is it's supply. It's circulating at 238,000,000+ (434,000,000 total). Competitors like neo and ethereum have a fraction of that. Doesn't mean I'm not hodling
2050 2018-01-03 21:51:11 No it's not lol. "Crypto OG" is clearly in reference to crypto. OG = Original Gangster, implying time spent/dues paid. Might be stupid, but still has a meaning.
2051 2018-01-03 21:51:05 Trading in crypto to crypro markets is absolutely terrifying.
2052 2018-01-03 21:51:05 $BTC $XRP は手堅く上昇というところでしょうか。 $XEMの値動きがどうなるか、ある意味ギャンブル仕込みです。
2053 2018-01-03 21:51:02 Why? Thinking of selling my stack 
2054 2018-01-03 21:51:02 In the current crypto climate, actually I think it’s harder in the inverse of most markets. Meaning, hard to stick to your guns and not buy crap coins just because they’re skyrocketing. Markets eventually return to rationality.
2055 2018-01-03 21:50:37 @RBC_Canada   will shut your account down if they see crypto activity. Banks will become a boutique service in the not too distant future. Outrageous fees, record profits and you think they are looking out for you?? Be your own bank, buy Bitcoin and @litecoin and end the cabal.
2056 2018-01-03 21:50:37 X100 is more what i am thinking about

2059 2018-01-03 21:50:35 Wealth in #crypto is created by the patient buying cheap coins from the inpatient..... $sumo that seller will regret this in a few months time.....
2060 2018-01-03 21:50:19 Usually everything turns red when btc is on a pump.. not everyone will be dumping which leads me to think that an increase in btc fiat value reduces satoshi in alts.
2061 2018-01-03 21:50:12 And I said you would never post any such statement, even though that entire conversation was based on fud from a website and look at you, you can't even accept that, we've tried it, it works, no point in proving to you because you'll just come out with some other BS

2067 2018-01-03 21:50:02 So when btc increases he $ value of an alt can increase. Does the satoshi decrease or is it because people are dumping.

2079 2018-01-03 21:49:37 I’ve got my feet dipped in both. Just like stocks, you just have to educate yourself about crypto to feel more comfortable trading. Buy cryptocurrencies you believe in and stay on top of its development/news.
2080 2018-01-03 21:49:27 Appreciate the revert 
2081 2018-01-03 21:49:22 Just jumped on $PASC - people calling it the 2.0 of $XRB. Thoughts  #Cryptofam?

2084 2018-01-03 21:49:15 #binance appears to be back online. definitely affected the space #crypto
2085 2018-01-03 21:49:15 Just got off the slopes to see $POWR on the moon!!!
2086 2018-01-03 21:49:14 Hey Luke, just letting you know that your pinned tweet is a bit out of date.  not sure if you know
2087 2018-01-03 21:49:09 Twitter is really just becoming a massive crypto chatroom.
2088 2018-01-03 21:49:04 I think so, Tron leader is very special. Knows when and how to do things.
2089 2018-01-03 21:49:04 On what platform do you trade crypto?
2090 2018-01-03 21:49:03 Bravo buddy. Keep up the good work.
2091 2018-01-03 21:49:02 You on instagram? I'd love to see pictures of when you're there. I went to Senegal for humanitarian aid back in 2012
2092 2018-01-03 21:48:55 #binance #binance_2017 is back up... trade away you #crypto #blockchain crazies 
2093 2018-01-03 21:48:52 2y in crypto 5y in forex. 5y/7y overall....
2094 2018-01-03 21:48:49 No, my entire position is that you need to be more honest and consistent in your analysis and look at the Crypto-market as a whole rather than being so micro focused on BTC because, yeah, barring any outside influence your charts may be legit, but BTC doesn’t exist in a vacuum.
2095 2018-01-03 21:48:43 Remarkable. #NEM #XEM passes #Litecoin on the Crypto-ranking board. I never thought I'd see this day. But, I never thought Charlie Lee would sell his shares when LTC was at an all-time high and reap in over 7000% in profits!
2096 2018-01-03 21:48:37 Ssssh. Idiots discussing crypto.
2097 2018-01-03 21:48:35 含み益が原資の10倍超えてる
2098 2018-01-03 21:48:31 Agreed. But in current crypto climate aren't 1000s of % gains pretty clear proof we're right? At least for now?
2099 2018-01-03 21:48:30 One of my biggest regrets of 2017 is not investing in crypto currency around this time last year ...woulda flipped 14x the COI 
2100 2018-01-03 21:48:29 Being a skilled trader doesn't make you a $crypto OG though
2101 2018-01-03 21:48:27 Buying $XCPO at 200 sat was the best decision I’ve made in crypto. Still going to hold.
2102 2018-01-03 21:48:18 so you havnt invested in verge
2103 2018-01-03 21:48:07 Braking News! AmEx announce full support to crypto's most private coins.
2104 2018-01-03 21:48:07 Hard to focus on anything else at all with crypto like this! 
What i meant to ask is: How is pumping silver sticking it to JPM?
2105 2018-01-03 21:48:05 Fake websites, fake social media accounts killing the #cryptocurrency potential. Stay educated, be aware and educate others. Crosscheck any accounts/websites before following them.

2107 2018-01-03 21:48:00 Problem is, if Ethereum 2x's from here, it's approaching Bitcoin's current market cap.

Something's gotta give.

2109 2018-01-03 21:47:53 bro i love you lol
2110 2018-01-03 21:47:51 Electroneum is going to be the McDonald's of crypto. No one wants to admit to having it, no one is impressed with it's quality, but the shit is everywhere.
2111 2018-01-03 21:47:33 @crypto_bobby you asked for ideas on some Alt-Coins. How about the ZFX ICO for ZeroSumMarkets? @ZeroSumMkts
2112 2018-01-03 21:47:33 yes this is even creeping into some fb groups im member of.Screen shots of how much money i made on this stock or this crypto.
2113 2018-01-03 21:47:31 thats what I think so too
2114 2018-01-03 21:47:30 Great post Karla, been wanting to build mine for some time now, interest in crypto currency but at the same time kinda not trusty about it, on the other weed stocks I know will boom when this reaches Central Europe
2115 2018-01-03 21:47:14 People are gonna be kicking themselves for not buying $LTC at this price in a couple of months
2116 2018-01-03 21:47:11 PnDs are psychological.These people that are just like "I don't care if I am up 1000% I am still accumulating more!!!" look like gurus of #crypto. Then all the while whales are dumping back people are listening to these guys keeping the buy book juicy to dump lots into. $XRP $STR
2117 2018-01-03 21:47:10 il devrait nous refaire un dip à 1600 ou 1500, la porte était pas mal pour vendre vers 2150, mais par la suite il continuera d'après moi pour peut-être 3k si pas de fâcheuse nouvelle
2118 2018-01-03 21:47:02 Very true and those that know wont' partake in @Ripple. Those that do know and are still partaking in Ripple i would like to assume know this and will get out when they think the time is right, namely after any potential coinbase annnouncement...
2119 2018-01-03 21:46:59 A lot of people must of had similar ideas, it was put on all major exchanges like Binance immediately after release. With an average volume of 100m. Impressive.
2120 2018-01-03 21:46:55 @realDonaldTrump agree with everything you are doing but geez guy this moving from one crypto currency to another as a taxable event is just nuts, rethink this.
2121 2018-01-03 21:46:49 I vet my invesments. Verge is going to go up sooner or later, the technology behind it is amazing. As far as XLM and XRP I have invested in those as well. However, XVG is a serious underdog with a lot of potential. It is one of my biggest bets.
2122 2018-01-03 21:46:48 Do you know what's the deal with log in

2125 2018-01-03 21:46:38 It’s funny how you think you know everything about me but in fact know nothing. I never had a twitter account before this one. So this is nothing but REAL.

2135 2018-01-03 21:46:14 Is a sub 20k $btc stabler?

A lot of resistances+supports= stability right?

When $btc is stable, $alts do well. 

Thing is, idk if im into something here or if im pointing out something obvious to every #crypto trader
2136 2018-01-03 21:46:09 Shit math on my $DRGN top 10 $9B. $37 per $DRGN at $9B. Calculator fail.
2137 2018-01-03 21:46:03 Init, started investing in crypto currency while there's been no boxing lmao
2138 2018-01-03 21:46:02 When you and @CryptoNickk keep making similar videos at the same time. Lololol. I must be getting the hang of this.
2139 2018-01-03 21:45:51 Get 30k ark and then it truly becomes passive income :) :)
2140 2018-01-03 21:45:51 That's true my tweter account has been created yesterday as I want to get knowledge about crypto in general and interract with other persons like me who try to find in which crypto it is interesting to invest. I find you are an aggressive person and i prefer to stop talking you
2141 2018-01-03 21:45:48 That's a pity story. Sometimes it's better to remain a holder not a trader)))

2143 2018-01-03 21:45:31 Sitting with a group of friends talking about crypto. Here’s what I learned:

1. There is a new coin in Japan that is $1 and will go up.

2. Don’t buy Ripple if you don’t have Bitcoin.

3. Avoid currencies and only buy coins.


2144 2018-01-03 21:45:22 Privacy is very important ..#SVG excells on that!
2145 2018-01-03 21:45:17 All of my crypto is up 1000% over the last two weeks. 
2146 2018-01-03 21:45:17 Very soon we will start seeing “Pay With Request.” I’m very excited for this. Request Network and #REQ are very undervalued, even after its recent run. This will soon break the $1B market cap. #RequestNetwork #crypto #btc
2147 2018-01-03 21:45:15 Bitcoin is going to crash... and burn. And with that all the other crypto currencies. #amen

$XRB $BTC $crypto
2161 2018-01-03 21:44:33 Agreed. A schooling lesson.

2163 2018-01-03 21:44:29 business for sure, but crypto will spoil lots of current coin owners who will spend without thinking. Also consider the luxury brand stock to go up, especially clothing company, that where people waste the most money. Crypto rich will make them rich :)
2164 2018-01-03 21:44:29 Nice one... I really hope to be able to give out like u real soon.. Am a work in progress

2166 2018-01-03 21:44:21 Is this FOMO
2167 2018-01-03 21:44:18 I also bought BTC on Mt.Gox soooo Ive never had this much fun with crypto.
2168 2018-01-03 21:44:17 Omar is usually quite early with such news. I'm surprised he hasn't talked about it yet.
2169 2018-01-03 21:44:13 Couldn't agree more. Traditional says never all in. $Crypto is never all out
2170 2018-01-03 21:44:04 Not opposed to a crypto book club to keep people honest! It’s a long list with some thick books on there
2171 2018-01-03 21:44:04 ya! You are good!  @22loops wanna buy my fresh #BTM? 
2172 2018-01-03 21:43:57 You guys switched to crypto once you realized you were washed with kicks
2173 2018-01-03 21:43:57 I think I'm the one fucking up for not looking into ripple lol
2174 2018-01-03 21:43:46 3) ..so when banksters have the BTC, they dump, XRP tanks down to $0.30  ..and they have control over the BTC. Anything to worry about?
2175 2018-01-03 21:43:40 No, not a good product, dogecoindark + tor + stealth addresses => joke tech. I don't know why it convinces some people even if some very skilled and established crypto-devs said/explained politely that it s pure s.
2176 2018-01-03 21:43:39 
2177 2018-01-03 21:43:32 D'acc j'aime bien aussi parce qu'ils ont des crypto qui ne sont pas disponibles partout puis le site est largement plus rapide que Kraken
2178 2018-01-03 21:43:25 If you cant wait even a month with a coin to turn profits don't even invest in it in the first place. to be down 7k one day is to be up 1k in a month unless you think the crypto market is going to sour and shrink.
2179 2018-01-03 21:43:24 I only say a word . HOLD it for some months. That fucking crypto will make lot of ppl owning a palace ! Is a very solid project
2180 2018-01-03 21:43:23 send them raiblocks instead
2181 2018-01-03 21:43:21 We've got to get this on Binance -- or better yet Bittrex -- This is going to be ten times where it is now At Least.
2182 2018-01-03 21:43:19 Verge is a joke. Feel rlly bad for everyone who Missed the xrp, zcl and xlm train while Sitting and waiting for verge to recover.
2183 2018-01-03 21:43:18 So much people like this comment and i think let to show you $AION ..telll something for this crypto :) (to the moon)
2184 2018-01-03 21:43:12 I really wonder y the ones that sell all this crypto currency are majorly jobless ???? Just saying , when it goes down both them and your money plus the assurance they gave all disappear at the same time !!!!!
2185 2018-01-03 21:43:12 sistem geri geldi..sorun yok şimdilik
2186 2018-01-03 21:43:08 In which we learn that the crypto world doesn't revolve around Eastern Standard Time. Binance upgrade at 4:00 pm? NO it's really 3:00 am. @binance_2017
2187 2018-01-03 21:43:07 where can i join ur crypto discord? :thinking:
2188 2018-01-03 21:43:06 I’m constantly confused why crypto traders complain about this. Why choose satoshis and not the million other units of measurement? And why get mad if people don’t follow your dogma?
2189 2018-01-03 21:43:01 What's trx
2190 2018-01-03 21:42:58 #Craptsy got me good and proper. fuckers. Paul Vernon still in china lol.. Good advise tho!
2191 2018-01-03 21:42:57 Dude 
2192 2018-01-03 21:42:56 You guys are doing great.
2193 2018-01-03 21:42:47 I am starting to feel that @Ripple is going to start allowing central organizations the ability to try and coopt the crypto movement, and obfuscate one of its most important concepts: decentralization.
2194 2018-01-03 21:42:46 I have recommended your show to many as it is one of the better crypto shows on YouTube.  I especially like your talks on psychology as I believe understanding it is 50% of being a successful investor.  What is Civics utility value of there token?
2195 2018-01-03 21:42:43 Whenever they’re done accumulating enough $zcl $Btcp that’s when they’ll announce it. Common sense says it’s an awesome investment
2196 2018-01-03 21:42:39 I'm comfortable with the crypto market being what it is currently, all things considered. That said, I'm honestly exhausted tracking so many holdings across so many places & daily monitoring. Tempted to just liquidate everything this week just to stop having to think about it.
2197 2018-01-03 21:42:34 $XRP going up significantly today. Maybe on rumors of @binance_2017, the highest volume exchange in the market today, adding the pair XRP/USDT. If this happens to be true, that'd be a huge pump in the price. Of course, only if Binance doesn't crash again #crypto #CryptoNews
2198 2018-01-03 21:42:33 Trolls are just the result of increased exposure. Keep on keeping on @parabolictrav .
2199 2018-01-03 21:42:31 By the time finished going though it crypto bubble will be consigned to history books.
2200 2018-01-03 21:42:29 Because you didn't exist before Dec 14. And all you do is shill. You're a self-serving pumper.
2201 2018-01-03 21:42:29 $xlc don't miss the next 10/20/50/100 bagger #crypto
2202 2018-01-03 21:42:26 It was just a markup, nothing big. Time span is hard to guess, depends on MM, but the longer it takes, the harder it goes, so it's better if it goes longer and you buy a bit more every day. Once it goes, and it will, you will see that markets reward patience.
2203 2018-01-03 21:42:25 This doesn't happen for another 5-6 hours
2204 2018-01-03 21:42:20 Crypto?

2209 2018-01-03 21:41:59 I was thinking the exact same thing
2210 2018-01-03 21:41:57 These multiple online brokerage outages already in 2018 tell you all you need to know about the mania from retail investors in weed/crypto.
2211 2018-01-03 21:41:51 Am reading the seekingalpha series on Bitcoin usage you referenced in one of your vids.  Any other crypto reads you've come across that are of as high a quality for investors?
2212 2018-01-03 21:41:48 No $XRM or $XRP?   Bias on this list or just not serious?
2213 2018-01-03 21:41:42 especially when suspicious activity starts like, delays, no communication, keeps going offline with no explanation, only partial deposits/withdrawals. red flags = gtfo

2218 2018-01-03 21:41:27 2) with that said, I want to run this by you & your readers: banksters want control; BTC, ETH coins put us in control. We buy XRP with BTC & ETH. As XRP continues to run, banksters acquire BTC & ETH.  We (sheep who desire Profit$) keep buying XRP as it runs to $10, $15, $20 ..
2219 2018-01-03 21:41:26 Great project, great support thanks cryptocampus
2220 2018-01-03 21:41:22 Ah the memories... 
2221 2018-01-03 21:41:21 I wanna give away 20 XVG. i know this is not too much but atleast it can get you a cup of coffee in the future. 

Only if XVG hits 24hr volume high of 0.00001065 by EOD(UTC -5).

2223 2018-01-03 21:41:06 Crypto currency is the future. It can be a key factor in attempting to eliminate corruption.

2226 2018-01-03 21:40:56 I’m in a bathroom stall and just overheard that one of our employees is leaving to trade crypto currency full time. Says the opportunity cost of being here is too great. Maybe we’ll hire him back after the crash.
2227 2018-01-03 21:40:55 And i am just jumping of them all..Over and over for the next stage..
2228 2018-01-03 21:40:52 Not at all. I believe someday we could live off of crypto. My point is we can't today and guessing which coin will win is the mother of all Hail Mary bets in something with open source code that anyone can replicate and issue with their own pre-mined coins.
2229 2018-01-03 21:40:51 Respect.
2230 2018-01-03 21:40:50 Awesome!

2231 2018-01-03 21:40:49 what crypto coin do I buy before a blizzard?
2232 2018-01-03 21:40:44 The high amount of interest in the private ico, and the partnerships is a big deal. Especially if they achieve even a fraction of what they say. This is an amazing sleeper.
2233 2018-01-03 21:40:42 All my friends say "i'm just buying it to make money"...
I just can't do it.. even if I made money.. it goes against everything that got me into crypto. I came here to get away from banks and to hide my transactions. FREEDOM is what all of that is! And XRP is fighting that.
2234 2018-01-03 21:40:41 Yeah but crypto isn't isn't regulated under the Securities Exchange Act; therefore not under the thumb of a centralized bureaucracy. I thought you didn't want centralization.
2235 2018-01-03 21:40:38 I hope more people use some of profits the way you do! But I already saw a few things like pineapples fund 
2236 2018-01-03 21:40:32 I should be down under that thread somewhere with open hands.. 5 #BTC faucet, lookin back.. lol.  ;)

2239 2018-01-03 21:40:15 It cannot be that approximately 21% of the aggregate crypto market cap is made up of tokens w/ an average daily trading volume of $0.00.

2260 2018-01-03 21:39:06 $OSTK the crypto bull stock to own
2261 2018-01-03 21:39:05 If you have moved crypto from one wallet to another or to an exchange it really is remarkable the time it takes to move XRP vs BTC. Seconds vs Minutes. Ripple v Bitcoin.
2262 2018-01-03 21:39:05 Bro invest in some crypto you will get your bag. I’ve been trading bitcoin and the other crypto currencies for over a year and it has given us the chance to focus on our art by not having to worry about money anymore. For real bro. Shits blowing up.
2263 2018-01-03 21:38:58 How many years of (successful) cryptocurrency trading experience makes someone a 'crypto OG'?
2264 2018-01-03 21:38:50 With #RDD you can just relax. With the other ones too. You need to HODL and relax. Longterm is the key in Crypto. ;) Good luck from Germany!

2269 2018-01-03 21:38:16 Has anyone else been playing with crypto currency recently? I’ve been finding some huge opportunities within it
2270 2018-01-03 21:38:13 You are improving the marketing issue @RicardoCrypto, the potential is there but the marketing in the crypto world is equally important! Good improvement, keep doing that (constant updates).
2271 2018-01-03 21:38:13 You are completely missing the point. Support coins with a solid foundation, great developers, and a project that you think makes a difference. Don't support something that is centralized and completely against what crypto stands for
2272 2018-01-03 21:38:11 You are the Oscar Wilde of Crypto.  Hats off to you :-)
2273 2018-01-03 21:38:11 Meeeee tooooooo
2274 2018-01-03 21:38:10 Sweet! Eerst maar die 50 cent/1 euro barrière slechten. Dan is de geest uit de fles! 
2275 2018-01-03 21:38:09 1) wow... haven't read ur stream in a while @parabolictrav  !  Damn, you must be doing something right to attract so many people opposing your strategy(s).     I appreciate what you share. Taking information in from multiple sources helps me come up with my own strategy.
2276 2018-01-03 21:38:05 Crypto market cap will hit 1 Trillion very soon. Probably before March. #BTC #CryptoCurrencies
2277 2018-01-03 21:38:03 If you're up in crypto you have to go so you stop looking at your portfolio
2278 2018-01-03 21:37:56 It’s easy to lose site of the most important things in life, Much respect rand!
2279 2018-01-03 21:37:54 The most valuable #crypto asset of 2018 is going to be attention.
2280 2018-01-03 21:37:47 Sent etherium and bitcoin to my account with crypto piano on 30th Dec from coinbase, both were successful according to coinbase. Bitcoin showed up on your site but etherium never did. Have tried to contact you several times but as yet no reply. Can you tell me where my coin is??
2281 2018-01-03 21:37:46 Respect!!! 
As soon as I am finished with university I plan to volunteer...tired of supporting this capitalistic world
2282 2018-01-03 21:37:40 You know my Love for Medical Cannabis. Has saved me from suffering opiate addiction due to breaking my back twice among other heal issues. Because of this, I'm always following new laws across the whole world. The only crypto cannabis I invested in was PRG at Pre-ICO. Just ROI'ed
2283 2018-01-03 21:37:37 He's also a savvy crypto investor/trader.
2284 2018-01-03 21:37:36 @Crypto_Daily Champ.... You should look into Cloakcoin and give us your opinion on that... :)
2285 2018-01-03 21:37:27 If you guys have been paying attention to $XRP, watch for $XLM. Should follow suit. Basically a decentralized version of #XRP. Long term #HODL and I really like the platform as well. Lots of room to grow. #Crypto
2286 2018-01-03 21:37:22 When people you got into crypto hit you up every time @binance_2017 down.  Like I dunno bruh, I don’t work there

2291 2018-01-03 21:37:03 Do you have a link to where this is stated?
2292 2018-01-03 21:37:03 Yeeeeaaaahhhhhh!!!!If crypto changed your world think how could you change the world.Happy new 9 from #leonesp! this is gonna be a real game changing year!
2293 2018-01-03 21:36:59 If Coin B also gives voting rights for governance things are different...
2294 2018-01-03 21:36:58 Nope, no I did not, but I should have, seeing that he got +18751 subscribers the day after the Logan video and only +80 5 days earlier so pretty much the same variation as a crypto currency value....agh I give up. 62 years, give or take 55 years :)
2295 2018-01-03 21:36:58 I don't know. I'm older than you, I suppose. The cryptocurrency thing feels a lot like 1996&1997 with ISPs. Is Bitcoin the crypto version of AOL? Yahoo? or Amazon? Time will tell. That is if cryptocurrency will become as ubiquitous as the internet. I could end up like Ag & Au.
2296 2018-01-03 21:36:44 Oh $powr, I've been hodling you since I bought the top in my first week of #crypto trading. You have taught me the hard lesson of never selling for a tremendous loss and be #patient. Thank you for the hard lessons (oh, and for coming back).
2297 2018-01-03 21:36:34 Wake up in the morning and most of my crypto is plus plus!! Happy but scared at the same time :| I didnt think about selling it but little scared when they go up so quickly

2303 2018-01-03 21:36:04 Trust me it’s not because the world is undergoing a sudden crypto awakening — everybody just wants to get rich while the opportunity still presents itself.

I bet the majority of the “investors” don’t even know what the block in blockchain is for.

Next line: Starting using in March for some amount
Right top to bottom: Utilizing the crypto currency technology
Mid ttb: Transfer fee could be 1/10

2326 2018-01-03 21:34:52 Sorry to bring to your Attention but had Binance just been hacked?
2327 2018-01-03 21:34:49 Think it will be added to bittrex or binance?

2331 2018-01-03 21:34:26 Maybe not and i understand why you say that however, if average Joe wants to send $100 to his mate half way across the world for almost zero fees, do you he think he cares about whether something is decentralised or not?

2345 2018-01-03 21:33:37 So $RDD volume is pretty huge on Bittrex right now. 5th spot. The bulls vs. the bears.
2346 2018-01-03 21:33:36 Like the fomo issues XVG had before bagholders got dumped on? Once the dump starts fomo plebs are the first to dump their bags.
2347 2018-01-03 21:33:36 What is surprising is that crypto OGs still hold religious beliefs about #bitcoin. $BTC innovation is basically nonexistent at this point. $ETH and $XRP could pass $BTC this month. Failure to innovate is a death sentence in tech. #Blockbuster #MySpace

2364 2018-01-03 21:32:39 Possible?

2377 2018-01-03 21:31:33 And to add, if @Ripple is the choice of governments then you definately can't fight it, instead to only offer solutions.
2378 2018-01-03 21:31:21 absolutely a BUY . Is a new , smart crypto! If you see who are founders... you will buy immediately ! #nowornever #nowornever #poe
2379 2018-01-03 21:31:20 Love it!!!
2380 2018-01-03 21:31:13 for sure. if 5% of crypto market cap went into silver it would fuck shit up pretty good. wait, i mean if 5% of gold market cap went to btc....lol. how the tables have turned.
2381 2018-01-03 21:31:13 Crypto OGs have an inflated sense of importance. As if, just because you were early you understand the market better than others. It’s condescending.
2382 2018-01-03 21:31:03 Some new hedge funds that have been watching crypto over the past 6 months got approval to invest after the new year. The correlated trends between XRP, ADA, XLM, XEM, TRX, SNT, STEEM, and some ETH are the one's they chose. They'll cash out EOY you'll see reverse 24hour trend
2383 2018-01-03 21:31:03 Yup, I  could only send $20 but every bit helps! Let's show the world crypto is not used for criminal activities!
2384 2018-01-03 21:31:03 sneaker twitter will lose a lot of money on crypto on a crash and won’t touch it again
2385 2018-01-03 21:31:01 There’s a massive problem in crypto community: Racist, neo nazi scum continuously becoming millionaires who will be funding further divide in society. And that’s why other crypto millionaires have a RESPONSIBILITY to support efforts fighting such abhorrence.
2386 2018-01-03 21:30:59 Centralized! Against crypto idealogy! Cap too high! Scam coin! Shit coin! Bank coin! ... it’s up to how much? What exchange is offering that again?
2387 2018-01-03 21:30:58 @ToneVays  been trying to forecast this for years. Good thing yall are buds. Brilliant minds to conquer crypto
2388 2018-01-03 21:30:57 Everybody that takes action with these crypto currencies....
Y'all will be straight this time next year!
Just stay persistent.
2389 2018-01-03 21:30:53 Yeh. All for crypto exchanges.

2391 2018-01-03 21:30:48 btc but lets just get to only something that's below $10 so you can ger much higher returns. When crypto market start to stable, you better buy Amazon stock, it will be over $3000 they might have to split twice
2392 2018-01-03 21:30:38 I 've been a developer for 25 years. I'm writing code now... I understand the technical aspect between the two Crypto. It has nothing to do with me getting my payment sent and delivered in one hour
2393 2018-01-03 21:30:37 Yes but it took 2 days. Ripple has some big FOMO issues
2394 2018-01-03 21:30:37 It’s better to have time and no money than to have money and no time. Crypto is not money so invest your time in learning 
2395 2018-01-03 21:30:35 @SafeHavenio Just read the white sheet, such an important element to owning $crypto looking forward to the launch.
2396 2018-01-03 21:30:32 Wow, everyone hyper-bullish on $IGNIS
2397 2018-01-03 21:30:31 what an incredible gesture of both care and overwhelming generosity. If we could all hope one day to be so human - well done Rand - Hats off to you !!!!

2400 2018-01-03 21:30:24 Bitcoin is becoming Myspace, at first everybody liked being able to customize their profiles, but that ends up creating a huge mess; eventually people flock towards structure like Facebook which is Ripple in the crypto universe
2401 2018-01-03 21:30:21 ETH is crushing on another level today for me  the crypto gods are speaking, we listening

2409 2018-01-03 21:30:00 Smashed the ICO. No cap. Low ICO raised because of the $6K BTC ATH that was happening at the time. The "even split" was absolutely epic. Probably the best gift of my life. Exchanges will happen when they happen. No rush.

2414 2018-01-03 21:29:38 @Crypto_Friendly is it a smart play to jump in and grab some zclassic off bittrex for the upcoming BTCP fork coming up? Or do you think it's a flop?
2415 2018-01-03 21:29:37 Haven't invested into #trx yet. Yes, I know I missed out on some $. I have been hearing they might partner with Alibaba. Has anyone heard any further updates on this? #crypto #icx #xvg #xrp #btc

2426 2018-01-03 21:29:14 Meet @ekpethedragon who thinks Ripple is a good crypto. Without covering from btc.
2427 2018-01-03 21:29:09 If you can understand the purpose of buying proprietary tokens at Chuck E Cheese, or Dave and Busters you can understand the value and use case of crypto currency.
2428 2018-01-03 21:29:06 As the problem of swisscoin is not resolved within the next 48 hours we will file a complaint directly with the Germany consulate
2429 2018-01-03 21:29:03 This is the stuff I like to see
2430 2018-01-03 21:28:55 congrats! Hope it goes to moon for you. I will wait for a huge drop or try for another ico as I like finding small ones that multiply. Disney backing can't be a bad thing
2431 2018-01-03 21:28:53 But you can't fight it so the best thing to do is tell people who YOU are better, not why someone else is bad. Facebook didnt win by slating Myspace, Ipod didnt win by slating Walkman. No. If your coin is so good then tell people why, not why the competition is bad.
2432 2018-01-03 21:28:52 So let's see what will happen when Asia wakes up, may the #crypto be with us

2436 2018-01-03 21:28:33 Not surprised the #binance #binance_2017 website has freaked out it's been an epic day in the crypto market #crypto

2440 2018-01-03 21:28:19 After the initial joy of Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies eating the breakfasts of banking tyrants I’ve come to realize that The Fed Reserve will eventually introduce their own Crypto and phase out physical cash so they can track every single transaction. #Bitcoin #Crypto
2441 2018-01-03 21:28:17 I think this about Children too

How many Minors own Crypto assets? 

Wouldn't the smart ones say they are older than they really are?

2450 2018-01-03 21:28:00 Wells Fargo laundered 0.5T USD of money for drug cartels thorugh its acquisition of wachovia. Crypto seems way more legit, people working for crypto orgs can monitor or should be able to.

2453 2018-01-03 21:27:53 You ever know a kinda shitty person that got a tiny amount of money or influence and their still shitty in the same way, but worse? It’s a magnifying glass, and in crypto, we get to see it happen in real time.
2454 2018-01-03 21:27:51 Cheds #1 unsung crypto hero. Diamond in the rough.
2455 2018-01-03 21:27:48 It might be from their scheduled system update

2461 2018-01-03 21:27:16 Very cool initiative!
Congratulations!
2462 2018-01-03 21:27:12 I think Trump will take credit for the mega-bull crypto rally. When Obama was president, BTC was $1,000 and ETH was like $15. Clearly crypto is rallying because it loves Trump.
2463 2018-01-03 21:27:12 Sometimes crypto can be a game of patience. Other times, you want to pull your hair out because everything around you is mooning and you missed out. #crypto #NotForTheWeak

2466 2018-01-03 21:27:05 At least!
2467 2018-01-03 21:27:02 Actually, in crypto, you just need to buy virtually anything, wait a few months, and sell at 300-30,000% gain. Eventually that won't work anymore, but it has for a while now.
2468 2018-01-03 21:27:02 I feel the same about my crypto investments. lmao
2469 2018-01-03 21:26:56 I’m not sure even you know how big crypto will get. We’ve never had world wide currency. This is going to be interesting and much bigger than anyone is guessing
2470 2018-01-03 21:26:50 Pour trader oui; moi je voulais juste changer de place mes cryptos, après j'achetais plus depuis quelques mois dessus (j'ai tout ailleurs pour 90% de ma crypto) :)

2473 2018-01-03 21:26:40 Crypto folks, how can I see the avg volume of #BTC #LTC and #ETH transfers out of @coinbase and into crypto-to-crypto exchanges? I am guessing answer nowhere.  #hopeful

2475 2018-01-03 21:26:31 Losing 66% in value means it must go 3x to regain prevous price level...
2476 2018-01-03 21:26:24 This is awesome! Good karma coming your way
2477 2018-01-03 21:26:22 Crypto currencies are supposed to make transactions faster yet. 5 days for funds to go from bank to Coinbase, another day to convert to BTC and xfer to BitStamp to convert to XRP.

Would still rather buy shares of parent company Ripple
2478 2018-01-03 21:26:20 God damn it. I agree with this though. 

***Immediately signs out of crypto twitter***

2497 2018-01-03 21:25:18 what do you think of ripple? ie ripple for me is simply a bank, all this goes against the community of free intentet, the cryptocurrencies in itself created to cope with the animals of wall street and yet the latter have entered the world of crypto with ripple

2516 2018-01-03 21:24:21 that's true, but you are implying that crypto will never be used to buy any real life goods. i believe that at some point in the future you will be able to buy something at the corner deli with crypto (of course not sure which coin that might be...)

2527 2018-01-03 21:23:55 $XRP to 24k sats and dead. Like this cycle.
2528 2018-01-03 21:23:53 Alright, I miss #bitcoin 6 months ago. These new people in crypto make me gag.
2529 2018-01-03 21:23:50 Hello Twitter! #myfirstTweet
2530 2018-01-03 21:23:47 Man I hope Macron was a crypto fashboi like I think he may be....
2531 2018-01-03 21:23:46 $TRX literally going to Orbit. Into another galaxy. Crypto Dogs are the way of the future. Chasing a bag is inevitable at this point...
2532 2018-01-03 21:23:46 Where’s my Bllodborne themed crypto called Gascoigne? Make it happen FromSoft
2533 2018-01-03 21:23:44 We are graphics designer with my brother @tips_future_crypto and also front-end developer.
2534 2018-01-03 21:23:42 What's the point? There is place for every good idea, crypto world is still tiny compared to fiat
2535 2018-01-03 21:23:41 Thank you
2536 2018-01-03 21:23:41 yes more of it.
2537 2018-01-03 21:23:35 Do what you want to do for yourself and don't follow random shills without research ;)
2538 2018-01-03 21:23:34 I consider White Christmas to be part of S2, that episode is pure kino.
2539 2018-01-03 21:23:32 I love your work Peter. Gold is one of my crypto hedges. Would be interested in how you might see a monetary based shock & subsequent  stock market crash would affect BTC. I think longterm bullish but intermediate bearish. What do you think?
2540 2018-01-03 21:23:31 You rule!

2542 2018-01-03 21:23:25 Oh yeah! $DRGN is a perfect storm. Why?

1. Blockchain as a service (BAAS - awesome)
2. Developer-friendly (C#, Java, Python, NodeJS)
3. Started at Disney (street cred and business cred)
4. ICO machine (don't kid yourself, enterprise will come knocking to DragonChain 2018/2019)
2543 2018-01-03 21:23:19 Crypto nuisible
Renseigne toi
2544 2018-01-03 21:23:12 VEN Hedge?
2545 2018-01-03 21:23:02 Took 2 days to double
2546 2018-01-03 21:23:00 What a great attitude!!!!
2547 2018-01-03 21:23:00 5 of the top 10 crypto-currencies are not mineable.

Each of those unmineable coins have also issued billions of units.

This is not digital scarcity.
2548 2018-01-03 21:22:58 what wallet to use? Have a tutorial? How the heck do you trade if your money isn't in the exchange and it's in the wallet? Seems pain to transfer money from wallet back to the exchange to trade, and aren't there fees to do this?
2549 2018-01-03 21:22:56 QSP,  UTK I already hodl.  Waiting on Wanchain.  These 3 crypto are going to be fucking #HUGE in #2018
2550 2018-01-03 21:22:54 Is this shaking the same head shaking non crypto folk were doing at the “OG”s when they believed BTC will get to $1000
2551 2018-01-03 21:22:53 are you sure that's the ETH address? i can't find it
2552 2018-01-03 21:22:46 Nice work
2553 2018-01-03 21:22:46 Nice Bro!!!
2554 2018-01-03 21:22:46 Bacon does? Moreso than say beef which a muslim eats?
2555 2018-01-03 21:22:45 I am really thinking that there must be a lot of ‘high power’ players that simply do not want to see this one take hold.....???? Proven now that it works and a developer and team that just wont stop working to make it even better.... #verge keep up the great work!
2556 2018-01-03 21:22:43 Not that much value when you could have gotten WABI for fractions during ICO
2557 2018-01-03 21:22:40 If only more wallets worked well ... syncing to the blockchain can take days and transfers get compromised. Feels safer on exchanges in some cases
2558 2018-01-03 21:22:39 With all due respect, Ripple isn't even a cryptocurrency. In fact it's the complete opposite. If you want a corporate coin go with XLM. Semi decentralized and Lumens are essential to the network.
2559 2018-01-03 21:22:35 Awesome gesture!
2560 2018-01-03 21:22:31 $doge はくっさの基軸通貨の立ち位置でいいですか？過半数の合意得れますよね？
2561 2018-01-03 21:22:29 way to go 
2562 2018-01-03 21:22:26 I think I might have some ETH on my old PC, I'll send it to this project!

2567 2018-01-03 21:22:19 Siacoin is going to grow a lot. Just a feeling... If you didn't bought it yet, run for it!  You can retweet this later... #CryptoCurrency #Crypto #blockchain #investments #Siacoin #sc
2568 2018-01-03 21:22:17 Cardano, Stellar et NEM devant le @litecoin  2018 va être excitant 
2569 2018-01-03 21:22:17 As in any market the vast majority are clueless speculators who will get rekt when the tide rolls out. And to answer your question, of course the value will roll back into the global reserve currency of crypto.
2570 2018-01-03 21:22:17 Gr8 contribution sir, this community rocks
2571 2018-01-03 21:22:15 
2572 2018-01-03 21:22:07 Bangun2 nilai asset crypto naik drastis

Profit from $XLM = 340%
Profit from $XRP = 70%

Abis subuhan bs tidur nyenyak lagi ini 
2573 2018-01-03 21:22:01 Obviously it's early and crypto is in its infancy, but I do find that stat concerning. You're the expert -- what do you make of it?
2574 2018-01-03 21:21:59 どちらにせよ今のタイミングで買って損はないと思います。今年一年というスパンを考えたら。
2575 2018-01-03 21:21:58 Yeah I'd say Season 3 > 2 > 1 > 4 when considered as a whole. The first two episodes of S4 are good but I felt the rest were either excessively bleak or uninteresting.

2579 2018-01-03 21:21:41 Surtout sur la crypto je comprends pas ... C'est full décentralisé l'Etat intervient absolument nul part donc ok pour le taxer mais ça devrait pas dépasser 10/15%
2580 2018-01-03 21:21:40 Made 100% profit these past 2 days trading from what i had befor #Crypto
2581 2018-01-03 21:21:39 I stand corrected. WTF is going on?
2582 2018-01-03 21:21:38 People should realize, #paccoin is probably one the last with a team of its kind + with the price its currently at.
2583 2018-01-03 21:21:38 I'm with you too! Thank you!

2586 2018-01-03 21:21:20 
2587 2018-01-03 21:21:16 This is proof we are in a bubble! Maybe yes.. but for sure I don't want that to happen.. at least for 1 or 2 more years! Let's go #crypto, lets make the biggest bubble ever!!!! #bitcoin
2588 2018-01-03 21:21:15 Bitcoin specifically I guess, I can see some of the applications from the crypto/blockchain technology...
2589 2018-01-03 21:21:15 How will BE help the average crypto investors who buys and holds. No understanding of trading platforms but wants to get into it.
2590 2018-01-03 21:21:14 Will do

2597 2018-01-03 21:20:55 @justinvendetta @XVGDolphin @crypto_sarah9 patiently waiting for Verge to officially announce its big achievements to the mass media. Looking at the trades all day,  I can tell verge is purposely being dumped in large quantities to keep it from succeeding.

2603 2018-01-03 21:20:16 em nenhum momento eu disse que era boa. Só disse que futuramente será uma das maiores criptomoedas, e de fato ela está caminhando pra isso, principalmente quando entrar na @binance_2017

2611 2018-01-03 21:19:53 Appreciate your efforts and time!
2612 2018-01-03 21:19:53 All I know, is that I would never take stock advice from some guy on #twitter.
But what I also know, is that if I were you I'd be buying stock in #Ripple #XRP. #Crypto
2613 2018-01-03 21:19:52 Vapourware and Ponzi? is that really your genuine feeling about Ripple Labs? I can't see it, I see them bridging crypto / mainstream. I see them being a huge force.
2614 2018-01-03 21:19:49 Hey Amigos! Pavel I followed your suggestion just in time to catch RDD yesterday! Thank you for doing this also Eric! You guys rock! Keep sharing and together we will grow  this crypto revolution all the way. Seriously this year is going to pay for my 3 little boys' s education.

2619 2018-01-03 21:19:35 are u serious binance is down right after you posted... very suspicous
2620 2018-01-03 21:19:35 @Crypto_goat_ .. I have no money to buy more Ripple. But I have some. My only way to increase my holding is to sell and buy back after a correction (dip). Can you please help me and suggest a dip?

2622 2018-01-03 21:19:20 #Crypto Today: #Bitcoin stays quiet near $15K, #Ripple climbs above $3
2623 2018-01-03 21:19:19 Certainly @Todd_Murphy1 but the other issue is, given the controlling block of said crypto is quite a 'whale' can easily manipulate the price and with the opposite position in futures keep cycling large returns.
2624 2018-01-03 21:19:16 Good call. I bought a ledger but its still in the box. Thanks for the reminder.
2625 2018-01-03 21:19:15 Sad to see crypto noobs not caring about the reasons why #bitcoin was created. They just want quick profit and returns. Sell your souls to the devil and well be back at square one.
2626 2018-01-03 21:19:12 The distribution of XRP continues to be and will continue to be a significant problem. It was good that Vias hinted at broader distribution. 

Lastly show me a crypto that produces as much value as its market cap and I'll show you a coin no one has bought yet. All are over priced

2630 2018-01-03 21:19:03 Yeah bitcoin fluctuates a lot but that’s 1 currency in crypto. They have penny coins, dollar coins. Safe ROI’s.
2631 2018-01-03 21:19:03 bitcoin...crypto the wave
2632 2018-01-03 21:19:01 this isn't funny anymore... it could actually happen
2633 2018-01-03 21:18:59 #Litecoin refusing to give up around that $240 breakout level, bullish resiliency warrants a close eye, could be the next crypto to make a quick move, watch $260 $LTCUSD
2634 2018-01-03 21:18:58 haha its so redic that the first thing new crypto investors are buying XRP
2635 2018-01-03 21:18:54 #hodl #xvg #buy #trx
2636 2018-01-03 21:18:52 Also, consider the fact that someone new to crypto looking to invest $1000 would have to wait until bitcoin hits $30,000 to double their money whereas lower priced alts are offering the same return much more quickly.
2637 2018-01-03 21:18:50 J’aimerai investir dans les crypto monnaies mais j’y connais rien... quelqu’un pour m’aider à me lancer ? #cryptocurrency #help #start #bitcoin #buy

2644 2018-01-03 21:18:26 What is the best wallet to use????
2645 2018-01-03 21:18:23 Any low cap coins doing well it's all the new money coming in. Privacy is the in thing with crypto same as Decentralized
2646 2018-01-03 21:18:09 @JournalducoinAT Salut les Boss de la Crypto . Vos vidéos et news sont top, vous êtes d’une aide précieuse !!! BRAVO et mille merci pour tout votre travail !!
2647 2018-01-03 21:18:08 Tbh pretty much every crypto currency nerd seems to miss the obvious fact that currency is in many ways an extension of power the state/elite use. It can’t be purely separated as some magical abstract declaration of worth.
2648 2018-01-03 21:18:07 I'm following you for 2 weeks so i can't contribute. I do want to thank you for the information, insights and tips you give to new people in the crypto world. I've gained allot of USD already! (Kidding, BTC, don't block me). Thanks again!

2650 2018-01-03 21:17:56 This happens because  a) they feel they missed out b) they haven't read up or understood crypto at all

2653 2018-01-03 21:17:44 Also, if we look at when they locked all of the wallets and everyone called it a scam, if they were going to dump the project they could have just opened the wallets and let them get hacked instead of paying HackerOne to secure the system
2654 2018-01-03 21:17:41 I would't call it a bubble, it's just a consequence of new (and dumb) people entering crypto. They don't know where their money should be so they just start copying their friends or family or even some virtual friends on social networks like Twitter and Facebook. #RektSoon
2655 2018-01-03 21:17:40 Crypto hell?
2656 2018-01-03 21:17:36 Vale muito a pena investir em altcoins com mercado muito pequeno mas grande potencial: não é difícil ver um crescimento de 10x, 100x ou até muito mais

2672 2018-01-03 21:16:37 Community is very important no doubt. But we're also not here to financially support science projects either. Unless the crypto currency is a real business model and solving a real problem, it won't be around a few years from now. "Community" doesn't guarantee profitability.
2673 2018-01-03 21:16:36 my specialty is the social, cultural, and ethical inconsistencies/best practices in crypto, I'm not technical, so however you want to word that.
2674 2018-01-03 21:16:36 Which website do u use to do your analyse
2675 2018-01-03 21:16:33 What solid projects do you like?
2676 2018-01-03 21:16:31 want to be balanced on crypto? this is the conversation
2677 2018-01-03 21:16:30 #CRBP was the first investment I ever made in June, 2017. Sold all my shares with quite a bit of profit. I'm happy, but I'm happier about the fact that that profit just made its way to the #crypto world. More #Litecoin it is before that jump, I guess. #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin

2679 2018-01-03 21:16:18 Hello Sir, all these are tech companies disguised as crypto currencies and they are selling tech to big companies, they don’t care about you.
2680 2018-01-03 21:16:10 This is simply not true. The wraith protocol is 100% untraceable. With Verge you can choose between a public and private ledger. This is very discouraging to read, but FALSE information
2681 2018-01-03 21:16:04 # Crypto currency- Bitcoin is expected to contribute 0.3 % to Japan’s GDP
2682 2018-01-03 21:16:04 Good work, what about $TRX ?
2683 2018-01-03 21:16:01 Oh I always buy high and sell low . Lol
2684 2018-01-03 21:16:01 Teaching all my friends the 3 step Crypto Program 1) Get a free wallet  & learn to send/receive Bitcoin Cash 2) Get on an exchange and get more Bitcoin Cash 3) Get Bitcoin Cash off the exchange onto a hardware wallet.  Easy as 1,2,3.  BCH RICH!
2685 2018-01-03 21:16:01 This new CEO is going to have the shortest time on job in the history of the crypto industry.
2686 2018-01-03 21:15:57 They took on a dev for Monero who has remained unnamed. They have no reason to dump the project, it would reflect very badly on his companies.
2687 2018-01-03 21:15:55 Actually, no. My account exists somewhat longer than that, and the only reason it looks so bad is because I almost don't use Twitter at all. If you look into my account a bit deeper, you'll find that I've been active in some other Twitter conversations.
2688 2018-01-03 21:15:52 I miss MintPal, not so much Cryptsy.
2689 2018-01-03 21:15:44 Investing all my crypto currencies into Ripple
2690 2018-01-03 21:15:37 no idea. 

i was into old coins years ago so i follow the price. not a big silver trader anymore with crypto the way it is.
2691 2018-01-03 21:15:33 DMAuEsHdnT83CJzuyA8sPT8QcWJLM35Um9
2692 2018-01-03 21:15:30 I think you meant to reply to the guy asking you to stick to reality television. I personally welcome you to the Crypto and $OST community.
2693 2018-01-03 21:15:23 masternode coins are basically crypto ponzis. get in first, cash out forever (if your coin keeps getting bought)
2694 2018-01-03 21:15:14 New into crypto and trying to figure out the safest way to store my coins. Any suggestions?
2695 2018-01-03 21:15:10 DMWU7HKtvqDgv7RJdswV6hX62whMFTn6Bb - Cheers, mate!
2696 2018-01-03 21:15:07 What you mean ?
2697 2018-01-03 21:15:03 Totalmente de acuerdo. Crypto y blockchain están para quedarse y no han hecho más que llegar. Pero habrá una explosión de época y me parece absurdo que una empresa “normal” cree un token para financiarse. No tiene ningún sentido. Pero claro, quien no quiere dinero gratis.
2698 2018-01-03 21:15:02 @RevolutApp will you be adding more alt coins? XRP, XLM, FunFair please! Can we get a road map for sending crypto to other exchanges?
2699 2018-01-03 21:15:00 can a blood buy crypto currency?
2700 2018-01-03 21:14:50 Burn complete! Next stop is Cryptopia!
2701 2018-01-03 21:14:50 Some guy that looks like Prince EA just ran up in Whole Foods repeatedly screaming bitcoin like a methhead  happy crypto ńęwÿêår
2702 2018-01-03 21:14:48 3 IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU BUY A CRYPTO: 
1. Is there a limit supply
2. Does it solve a world problem 
3. How large is the community
2703 2018-01-03 21:14:41 If we are talking specifically about crypto, I think most people (journalists included) don't understand how it works/what it's purpose is outside of the recent trend of people treating them like stocks. More broadly speaking though I'd have to disagree...
2704 2018-01-03 21:14:40 For all who have been here for a few years now we can clearly see fundamentals clearly don't mean anything right now. What I'm curious to see is once this pops will that money be flowing back into the legacy system or will it stay in crypto.
2705 2018-01-03 21:14:39 Crypto portfolio actually coming along nicely. Excited for 2018.
2706 2018-01-03 21:14:36 This is true for more than crypto. I had a talk this am about how to succeed in business without shitting on your competitors, same reason horses wear blinders at the track
2707 2018-01-03 21:14:36 2 PM PST? Or maybe we can crossover and you can interview us mutually, after individually.

@NeerajKA had a great idea of doing a "crypto around the horn." With the Ripple drama i'd look into inviting @JoelKatz to a discuss as well. He seems to be open to cutting through the BS.
2708 2018-01-03 21:14:36 It's like $DGB but in metal !
2709 2018-01-03 21:14:34 If so you better go crypto and ready your own central bank that can create your own money...then..... Freedom......
2710 2018-01-03 21:14:33 good job!!!
2711 2018-01-03 21:14:33 入金祭り！！
2712 2018-01-03 21:14:31 Thank you. I can’t stand the “purists” who denounce XRP talk about their XLM positions without an ounce of negativity.
2713 2018-01-03 21:14:30 @levelsio
2714 2018-01-03 21:14:26 Welcome to the world of Market Makers, Cartels, and Cabals. If you think Joe Public makes these moves, you're nuts and naive. Joe Public just gets left holding the bag. Maybe you should interview an old NYSE specialist and ask him how he'd be a MM in crypto.
2715 2018-01-03 21:14:21 still got my ZET and FST on it
2716 2018-01-03 21:14:21 Vircurex is still alive
2717 2018-01-03 21:14:19 Stupid Cryptsy... 1,000,000 Warning signs before they got "Hacked".
2718 2018-01-03 21:14:17 they should make one for crypto coins investments too. ;)
2719 2018-01-03 21:14:16 @T_OConnell $EVEP On the move from December lows to .70 you gave this around .80 ran to 1.35 with a quickness. I know it’s not crypto but what you think??
2720 2018-01-03 21:13:57 Markets closed & now it’s time for my night shift job trading crypto...
2721 2018-01-03 21:13:47 All the crypto coins are doing fantastic, any of them would be a great time to get into at this time!
2722 2018-01-03 21:13:46 Imagine the amount of money's on #Binance at this moment with +3.000.000 users. wauw
2723 2018-01-03 21:13:42 but can we continue trading them by storing them in a proper wallet ? like once they are stored in wallet, we wont be able trade them unless we get them back in exchanges right ?
2724 2018-01-03 21:13:40 Yeah, I guess I'm finding out that volumes don't really lie in the crypto space! Depending on the coin it might be a quick pump and dump and other coins it's a run up to the moon!
2725 2018-01-03 21:13:39 Sure, focusing on things right now because you can look at what they hope to achieve. Richard Ells the CEO, is based over here in the UK. He owns a few companies and is successful in what he does. he's very good at marketing and the ICO was the biggest successful ICO at the time
2726 2018-01-03 21:13:39 Glad to see this progress so far! Good future in store for sure!
2727 2018-01-03 21:13:34 How long before @Ripple hits the #1 spot on the crypto market caps? #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #Ripple #xrp #ETH #litecoin #ltc

2741 2018-01-03 21:12:18 IMO DOGECOIN should be a top 5 crypto

2754 2018-01-03 21:11:44 It's simple. You have built up 18,000 followers over time.  They are not noobs which means they have historically built their crypto lives around BTC and ETH and vote accordingly.  The XRP and BCH buyers have been in the market 3 to 6 months at best.

You need a coin without a fee to do that. You could give it sometime to players

 a binanace account, go to Deposits/withdrawals. Copy address, go back to coinbase and paste addresses in currwncy you wanna buy. Once purchased, currency will show up in binance balance for crypto you purchased. Did i miss anything?
2787 2018-01-03 21:10:09 Disagree entirely. The contest is not fair... Bitcoin dominance treats every crypto under the sun as if it had the same 21m cap and issuance as Bitcoin. They simply don't... The whole number is just one big lie with no basis in reality.
2788 2018-01-03 21:10:03 @jshocrypto Can you send me some crypto tips? (Low market cap) I’ve missed the boat with the last ones you posted on your blog!
2789 2018-01-03 21:10:01 If you get paid by a bank and don’t own any crypto, you’re repping a bank within crypto, not the other way around. That said, banks aren’t going anywhere in the short term and we need allies wherever we can get them. Strange bedfellows and such.

2822 2018-01-03 21:07:05 Any online service that makes you log in twice - is doing it wrong.
Each time is a potential security threat and doing it twice just validates a potential capture of you login info.
Besides it's as annoying as hell.
Good job asshats. You know who you are.

2826 2018-01-03 21:06:53 It’s a very brave effort by Korean law firm. I am sure they will win the case. Crypto currency to be treated as a commodity and there is no reason for governments to worry.
2827 2018-01-03 21:06:53 Vicetoken ico launches on feb 1st. Add free porn on steem blockchain that pays viewers. Penthouse behing them. This is under the radar so far. 100bn doll hair industry. A x100 easy.
2828 2018-01-03 21:06:51 Second-Tier Crypto Coins Are Starting to Catch Up to Bitcoin. Leader’s market share drops to 37% as alternatives rally. Altcoins rising faster than bitcoin as investors pile in.
2829 2018-01-03 21:06:44 People will be thinking that it is just XRP haters hating on $XRP doing "well".

We were warning people about the mega Asia led $BCH, $BTC pump's too, those who see the future in crypto do not want to see newcomers getting stung or left bag holding.

2835 2018-01-03 21:06:10 Pretty much all crypto traders are trying to do one thing only..... make more BTC......

2837 2018-01-03 21:06:09 #ripple #XRP is ripping of the real initial #bitcoin concept. This is a banking tool which price is being manipulated so it can fool the profit hungry BTC, ltc and eth (real crypto) holders to sell. Say no to ripple and buy some #decentralised, #uncensored and #scarce BTC.

2844 2018-01-03 21:05:48 i invested in this coin over a month ago, was starting to think i got scammed because i hadnt heard a single bit of news. Glad to see this today

2856 2018-01-03 21:04:37 What idiot told the bankers about Crypto? We were supposed to keep it amongst the techno-neo-utopia-libertarians untill we were ready for world domination. Instead we had to goad Jamie Dimon into pumping $XRP just to make a point.

2863 2018-01-03 21:04:03 three tech terms i've created for 2018:
1. auctionpreneur: a person who makes a living on ebay
2. coining: the high you get off a crypto surge
3. botulism: obsession with bots
2864 2018-01-03 21:03:59 @Networktoken has increased 1300 percent in a week. And its just beginning. Crypto education at its best.
2865 2018-01-03 21:03:52 Don’t underestimate how important community is to these projects.  Any decent developer can make 99% of these coins (aside from some of the protocols and tech heavy projects).  The coins that thrive are the ones we as a crypto community believe in and support
2866 2018-01-03 21:03:51 they had no cap on their ico right? Think thats why it's real high and still on a shady exchange. Looks good but feel it needs to drop more . Did you get in during ico?
2867 2018-01-03 21:03:49 Why Lisk? Well, Lisk actually enables any programmer on earth to code decentralised blockchain applications using Javascript as a programming language. Basically every programmer knows and uses Javascript. What crypto really needs is real life adoption. Go figure! $LSK
2868 2018-01-03 21:03:47 There is no rhyme or reason to the current crypto market - the sooner we can all accept this, the better. The reality is that the retail investors are buying 'cheap' coins because they don't understand the concept of market caps... #bitcoin #ripple #ethereum

2885 2018-01-03 21:02:35 that's true for sure and that might bring down the crypto space at one point, but i don't think it will destroy it. "getting out" isn't possible in most cases where fiat is involved. imagine if everyone wants to cash out at the bank or stock market...
2886 2018-01-03 21:02:35 never heard of that "legend"...
2887 2018-01-03 21:02:25 Millet borsamı kaldı ya. Come to crypto currency.
2888 2018-01-03 21:02:24 I would never advise people to invest. I said go and have a look, it is up to you to research and come to your own conclusion just as I researched and came to my conclusion
2889 2018-01-03 21:02:17 Which hardware wallet do you use?
2890 2018-01-03 21:02:03 Lmao just because it's being adopted for legitimate use?  Not all crypto is for illegal purposes and needs to be decentralized.
2891 2018-01-03 21:01:58 Please do you own research, but tron (trx) is also doing well and they will have a coin burn so price will go up. If you are not into crypto and want to learn this penny coin will be a good starting point. Just remember only invest money you are willing to burn and research.
2892 2018-01-03 21:01:42 RT RicardoCrypto: People, Crypto isn't a gambling game.

2901 2018-01-03 21:01:23 Don’t be so silly Liam. Everyone knows if you make £10 on crypto currency, you are automatically given a PhD in Crypto Expertry
2902 2018-01-03 21:01:13 Yeah. It seems like KuCoin has really opened the trading door for $DRGN. Ether Delta is a dumpster fire - especially after the hack. I see lots of people sending out KuCoin referral links encouraging people to sign up.
2903 2018-01-03 21:00:59 Love the show @NarcosNetflix. Makes me think though... Nowadays any one with half a brain at the DEA would get the cartels hooked on $crypto especially @Ripple and $xrp... Problem solved #xrpthestandard #XRP #Ripple

2922 2018-01-03 20:59:56 The $XRP coin that you guys are all buying can't be used for anything. The blockchain ripple uses isn't a public chain and can only be used by banks. Not to mention it goes against every fundamental of crypto.
2923 2018-01-03 20:59:53 I don't see the supranational crypto playing out. But more and more countries, especially smaller ones, will look at crypto as a viable alternative. Who knows what 2018 will bring, we may in for a surprise.

2939 2018-01-03 20:58:44 People who call $btc a bubble are  scared of it’s potential or don’t understand what a bubble is. 

Investors want decentralization. They  do not trust 3rd party institutions. 

#crypto allows investors to transact how they want vs. forcing behavior through lack of better options

2955 2018-01-03 20:57:31 I was thinking the IRS is going to need very skilled white hats to actually monitor and regulate the crypto money flow. Controlling the exchanges is basically all you need to do. Currency demands a lot of faith and use to survive, take coinbase down and poof.
2956 2018-01-03 20:57:30 Happy birthday Bitcoin !!!
2957 2018-01-03 20:57:26 VERGE D7DdKXUo5QGAL2VGXoHTi6JZUdgdRmTVh2
please sent me a few verge wana start also with crypto even if its only 1
2958 2018-01-03 20:57:20 This will push renewable energy innovation at a quicker rate. I’d say this is a good thing.
2959 2018-01-03 20:57:04 Your BitGrail market is great. I only don't understand the withdrawl limit for unregistered users. Personally I want to bring the money to a wallet and then back to BitGrail but thats not possible. 
I would have no problem with the withdrawl limit if you have more coins
2960 2018-01-03 20:56:42 If you are looking for next $xrp, $xlm, $eth, $neo, you should look into next layer of the blockchain. Crypto needs scalability and instant transactions for going mainstream. 
$rdn is a great project, way undervalued at $266m cap. Could go to $10B cap in 2018.  That's 35x
2961 2018-01-03 20:56:39 she is beautiful
2962 2018-01-03 20:56:38 This consolidation may happen fast.
2963 2018-01-03 20:56:36 Will the PXT show up on Crypto Market Cap?
2964 2018-01-03 20:56:26 So many of those are lost forever
2965 2018-01-03 20:56:22 Also the OG crypto community does not need to support $XRP for it to be successful. The uses for crypto go far beyond digital gold for libertarians.
2966 2018-01-03 20:56:08 @Aliuenal66
2967 2018-01-03 20:56:06 High fees why? Because you’re using coinbase ? Gemini is way less. GDax almost free
2968 2018-01-03 20:56:03 Maybe and I don’t disagree. I’m just more arguing why it seems BCH fans are the most vocal when it comes to other coins. Do your own thing and if your coin is good, you win, simple :)
2969 2018-01-03 20:56:01 That boat seems to be causing a very large #Ripple 
2970 2018-01-03 20:56:00 I’m thinking there has to be a way to make a cool educational board game around crypto coins. I can help design - any takers? Cryptopoly? Market Cap Crypto? Block Chain Gang? @FFGames @BlueOrangeGames @wizards_magic @StoneBladeEnt @gmtgames #btc #ltc #xrp #ripple
2971 2018-01-03 20:56:00 Can some 1 suggest me which 1 is the best crypto to invest in current if i want to start from like 200$
2972 2018-01-03 20:55:53 Hahahaha I love it
2973 2018-01-03 20:55:52 Wow... Such a stupid move @etherdelta !!

2978 2018-01-03 20:55:36 Adding a 'brain', or at least a proxy to an aggregated 'brain', in to the #crypto ecosystem. Needed are smart & autonomous Oracles to feed processed real-world & inner-world data to #smartcontracts. #SingularityNET could be this jigsaw piece. #Cryptocurrency $agi

2981 2018-01-03 20:55:24 Crypto coins making my life hopefull again 
2982 2018-01-03 20:55:15 A few months ago, when I got into Crypto. I was immediately amazed by the undervaluation of #Ripple #XRP. It was the only Crypto with a strong company, a lot of partnerships & best blockchain system (- mining).

If I would see it at $10, I would still buy 100%.

2983 2018-01-03 20:55:14 #HODL!!!! ;)
2984 2018-01-03 20:55:13 Wow. Its could hit 6 bucks in 3 months easily.
2985 2018-01-03 20:55:08 Crypto prices going through the roof. Even the sleeping giants #Siacoin and #TRX are making a move @justinsuntron @rogerkver @officialmcafee
2986 2018-01-03 20:55:07 New record from crypto currencies 730bln$ Total mkt cap. Bitcoin is not growing but cryptos mkt is moving up: this is the reason I have never bought 1 Bitcoin
2987 2018-01-03 20:55:00 I believe it’s gonna keep slowly rising from here. 2018 will be a staple year for crypto currency.
2988 2018-01-03 20:54:55 Nee... "Ripple verkoop onderhoud". Al een ruime week...  :(
En ik verkoop ze inderdaad nu niet, maar ik baal ervan dat áls ik ze wil wegdoen, het niet kan!
2989 2018-01-03 20:54:51 Indeed, #BUZZ #crypto has a very high potential specially with their real-life use cases around #Energy & #BeeFarming
2990 2018-01-03 20:54:49 Cryptocurrency space flexing. Today the total Crypto Market Cap hits new All-Time High over $700 Bln. #cryptocurrencies #CryptoMarkets 
2991 2018-01-03 20:54:45 Pois é! Mais acho, como estávamos falando ontem, que uma ou duas dessas novas crypto vão vingar! O difícil é saber qual.... Hehehe
2992 2018-01-03 20:54:45 With crypto 2x your entire net worth in a week isn't enough. The greed is dangerous
2993 2018-01-03 20:54:44 Will do professional photography for crypto currency
2994 2018-01-03 20:54:42 What’s the deal with $LINX? DMOR, don’t get it. Loving the hype, don’t understand it...
2995 2018-01-03 20:54:36 Good man! He just sign in for Bitcoin cash development..
2996 2018-01-03 20:54:32 Disclaimer: I started crypto exactly 5 weeks ago coming from a healthcare background with 0 knowledge of this. I’ve leaned so much from Reddit YouTube and Twitter I can never say thank you enough to this amazing community!
2997 2018-01-03 20:54:26 Why invest before updates? Without product?
2998 2018-01-03 20:54:20 Well .19 isn't very sexy at all.  I predict it will break .20 in January
2999 2018-01-03 20:54:14 People buy ripple to scam bank-loving noobs that can't admit to themselves they were wrong about Bitcoin and dump it on them later (in order to make more Bitcoin) or they are hedge funds that are allocating ridiculously small portion of wealth to some snake oil crypto consultants
3000 2018-01-03 20:54:10 Mmm that's seems a bit premature.
3001 2018-01-03 20:54:07 I'd love to know more about crypto. Am in Nairobi Kenya and am really interested. How can I DM you and get to know more?
3002 2018-01-03 20:54:07 Where do I buy a time machine?

3009 2018-01-03 20:53:44 Up 1000% since my entry. With this being a #hodl of mine, I only ever added dips. It’s going to be $5 be4 Q2 - why take profits for $USD? $XLM ... scroll through my tweets for more disturbing #crypto gains
3010 2018-01-03 20:53:42 Buying bitcoin, still a little clunky :)

3015 2018-01-03 20:53:16 $OSTK price gain over the last 6-7 months was driven by growing mkt awareness of crypto investments. But here's the thing, e-comm alone is worth $80/share at EV/Rev of 1x which is still a huge discount to peers. @AlderLaneeggs @OverstockCEO

3021 2018-01-03 20:52:57 Pay attention to crypto related headlines from MSM. Its rarely ever positive and its no coincidence.

3024 2018-01-03 20:52:38 Tak já hlásím, že do tohoto coinu nedám ani dolar. V ostatních skutečných crypto coinech si taky nemůžu na výnosy stěžovat. Chápu, že krátkodobý výnos je na XRP lákavý.
3025 2018-01-03 20:52:36 Wow, too cool. Fair play to you @gavinandresen, I guess your plan worked!!! 
3026 2018-01-03 20:52:32 Not true.  Read up.  Goal is to be a social media platform for crypto on its own #blockchain that offers its own currency.  Pacfyle will be platform.  Think #Facebook of #crypto with its own #Currency!
3027 2018-01-03 20:52:28 Thoughts on $FUN #CRYPTO
3028 2018-01-03 20:52:24 No doubt Ripple is benefiting from the current bullish sentiment in the crypto market,” said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro. 
Over the last two weeks, every client I speak with wants to talk about Ripple,” said Greenspan.
3029 2018-01-03 20:52:21 Ripple is polar opposite of what crypto stands for! Sad day aye.
3030 2018-01-03 20:52:16 Imagine if his wife finds out he gave out 1100 BTC
3031 2018-01-03 20:52:13 That’s impossible to predict. But this is a long term hold for me so I never care about the % for short term. Only if I am doing a scalp trade is when % count short term
3032 2018-01-03 20:52:09 My crypto currency is up 30% now. 

Wish I had invested more than $100.

3036 2018-01-03 20:51:54 Wait for another 5 years, Malala's true colours will come out... She is a crypto-Jihadi who is being carefully groomed - the world is being fooled as evident by your tweet
3037 2018-01-03 20:51:54 My withdrawal is still pending after 3 hours 
3038 2018-01-03 20:51:47 The stock market is acting like it's jealous of the crypto market.

Kind of pathetic really.
3039 2018-01-03 20:51:45 Doubled settings work best for crypto. 20 60 120 30
3040 2018-01-03 20:51:34 Yep - I've been keeping an eye on it for a while (and non crypto stocks I have my eye on) but I've never had the time to look into trading, the platforms or lingo etc.

3044 2018-01-03 20:51:19 I bought some when I started crypto. Because I tought it was cheap, lol stupid...
3045 2018-01-03 20:51:17 This could be fun. "Watch as Yev learns enough to invest $20 in crypto"
3046 2018-01-03 20:51:11 You'll find crypto addicts here on twitter, not the herd that is buying into XRP today.
3047 2018-01-03 20:51:06 No
3048 2018-01-03 20:51:03 If Alex @RealAlexJones is pushing crypto, beware. Also @geraldcelente seems to have changed position on cryptos too over the years. Now claims he told people to get in early.

3057 2018-01-03 20:50:37 I just checked with my bank as I had to speak to them regarding something else. The payment won't clear till the 10th. Kind of misleading to say it can take, 'a little longer'.

3089 2018-01-03 20:49:13 With u on this one. Let’s ride it out
3090 2018-01-03 20:49:13 Not one crypto OG is looking at the market and not laughing and/or shaking their head ... not one. Newbies beware
3091 2018-01-03 20:49:05 One big lesson I’ve learned with #crypto investing over the past year - definitely diversify.  Many altcoins are doing much much better than the big ones (except #xrp - that’s on ).
3092 2018-01-03 20:49:05 It will be bigger than Google. You can't value speculation you can just figure out what the mass psychology will do. If you compare the size of Google and of Crypto you can see there is a lot left to go especially when you see the masses flooding exchanges.
3093 2018-01-03 20:49:04 If nothing else we WILL be the generation that made investing fun and easy. #altcoin #Crypto $xrp $trx $ltc $waves
3094 2018-01-03 20:49:02 Some dude wrote an article on LinkedIn saying Ghana should load up on BTC and already there are articles being spread as if this was a done deal? Welcome to crypto
3095 2018-01-03 20:48:52 Based on prior tweets I think we disagree a fair bit on the crypto sphere. Still, thoroughly enjoy absorbing and countering your POV. So Thanks :)
3096 2018-01-03 20:48:45 Perso je trouve ça génial, facile à retenir, à prononcer, à lire. C'est sexy et international ! Un nom parfait pour une crypto de tous les jours

3104 2018-01-03 20:48:13 hey stu pid.., Crypto Currency is
3105 2018-01-03 20:48:09 Crypto trading is a certified addiction you heard it here first folks, ya’ll like heroin users
3106 2018-01-03 20:48:00 l o l
3107 2018-01-03 20:47:57 In crypto you can buy a loser, but chances now are in favor of things going up, only a few of the top 100 coins didn't make decent profits last 30 days. If people don't spread their risk they will be at risk,  but spread and 1 or 2 bags aren't that bad imho
3108 2018-01-03 20:47:57 DECENTRALIZATION IS WHAT GIVES CRYPTO VALUE.
3109 2018-01-03 20:47:44 love this

3111 2018-01-03 20:47:36 $dope　$THC　を手放した事が去年で一番悔いが残る出来事だわぁ・・・。
最大の機会損失。意思の弱さ乙です。今年は意思を強く持つ。頑張ります。
3112 2018-01-03 20:47:19 You can fool just yourself. The whole market is buying crypto under 1$ these days. "Investors" they said.
3113 2018-01-03 20:47:15 thats probably wrong though. i havent heard of a country (in europe) where crypto>crypto is treated as like-kind exchange
3114 2018-01-03 20:47:15 What I predict is going to happen over next few years is BTC will do just fine, maybe even in line with "moon" predictions, but 90% of crypto market will crash to hell (as it should). 

And both sides -- cynics and optimists -- will claim they were right.
3115 2018-01-03 20:47:13 the first issue was domain name, then maintenance, now overload.... when is the time to have a normal service like other exchanges that have much more loads that you do (bittrex, bitfinex, poloniex....)?
3116 2018-01-03 20:47:09 seems I had the wrong idea xDDDDDDD #fml
3117 2018-01-03 20:47:02 Actually It’s HS on 4h charts also
It’s a very tricky position now
3118 2018-01-03 20:46:59 Very True, crypto technology is constantly evolving, as is the geopolitical reaction to it. For example if the US were to take a stance like china and ban non-apprlved currencies the whole crypto ecosystem could collapse. Interesting times for sure
3119 2018-01-03 20:46:57 #UKG going to be stratospheric for 2018
- great leadership and team
- huge amounts of cash
- not listed on any decent exchange

Add this #crypto to your shopping basket. Unikrn
3120 2018-01-03 20:46:52 Yes looking at it BTC is used to purchase most cryptos so in reality it could be damaging to the crypto markets. What we need is bitcoins to fly so all others can follow
3121 2018-01-03 20:46:51 You see it everyday with penny stocks ,  easy to manipulate and pump but end of day they are just scams.  You seeing that now with some of these crypto pumps.  Coins with very little usage or merits pumped no different, eventually fundamentals catch up and the real leaders lead.
3122 2018-01-03 20:46:47 @WestonBergmann 1. I would dominate you in a 50m sprint...your choice of stroke and 2. About time you get on the crypto train

3124 2018-01-03 20:46:40 Trialling @eToro over the past week or so (new to trading) Made an investment into Ripple and now it's soaring!!!

Just a shame I was using virtual investment while trying to get to grips with things

3129 2018-01-03 20:46:33 I remember your tweet. Helped me hold.. thanks
3130 2018-01-03 20:46:31 @krakenfx this really disappointing; it’s taking you over a half an hour to send btc to my wallet. How can it be America puts people on the moon but isn’t able to operate a decent exchange for crypto.
3131 2018-01-03 20:46:29 #Fuloos digital #coin has its own particular Fuloos chain and dispersed system of hubs that make it extremely secure against assaults and difficult to get 51% accord. #btc #bitcoin #fls #altcoins #crypto

3135 2018-01-03 20:46:13 Vendido el 75% del $XVG que me quedaba. Me gusta pero no termino de confiar en ella y además tengo demasiados proyectos que me gustan para diversificar. Luego subo captura del pump de 10.000%

3137 2018-01-03 20:46:05 Crypto
3138 2018-01-03 20:46:04 buy the dip :) ç'était pareille pour 70% des coin hier
3139 2018-01-03 20:46:00 I agree but a couple more exchanges helps out also. especially for the fact the TREX at moment is limiting amounts of new users from the many thousands of people entering crypto daily world wide.
3140 2018-01-03 20:45:56 Hopefully they can at least get the ball rolling and get added to the “community coin per month” on binance.
3141 2018-01-03 20:45:42 moon
3142 2018-01-03 20:45:41 Yup
3143 2018-01-03 20:45:25 The biggest concern is the war. Don't need crypto when you are dead
3144 2018-01-03 20:45:22 $BAY killing it!!!! Please tell me some of you bought some because of me... It is the most UNDERRATED coin in all of #crypto. True top 10 potential.

Next up is $UIS. Another veryyy underrated coin. Make sure to stock up now before POS.

$BTC $ETH $XVG $XMR $LTC $BCH $XRP
3145 2018-01-03 20:45:08 I get it, besides driving a Lambo enjoying a horse carriage ride can be nice too at times ;)
3146 2018-01-03 20:45:04 So *if* BTC gets a chunk of the SoV gold and reserve currency markets, then there will be *many* greater fools for a long time b/c the people who own BTC now will not be the people who own BTC then. And what do you do with BTC proceeds? Buy other crypto of course.
3147 2018-01-03 20:45:02 May I ask .., auto spelling is on 
3148 2018-01-03 20:44:52 Great call mate 
3149 2018-01-03 20:44:51 @DiaryofaMadeMan hey Ian, have you ever looked in NULS? And if so, what’s your opinion of it?
3150 2018-01-03 20:44:47 That’s a crypto currency
3151 2018-01-03 20:44:29 Marketplaces and DAPPs that are specifically exclusive to X coin is the missing Y to the formula  #dapps #decentralized #blockchain #bitcoin #crypto #ethereum #altcoins
3152 2018-01-03 20:44:27 I'm in ripple from long time and keeping it for long hold down care if it drop in btc value I will only see it in usd even if it drops 
3153 2018-01-03 20:44:24 I missed out on a 100x profit from a purchase I made in October. I've learnt my lesson . Patience is everything . #Crypto $alts
3154 2018-01-03 20:44:21 Can someone explain what this means
3155 2018-01-03 20:44:19 That’s it that I know of
3156 2018-01-03 20:44:16 I’m not convinced.. it’s a HS on small timeframes .. 
I think it will go out 0.38 0,5 from here and then down again to 14,200 300
Mouth the charting software are you using
I would like to have the volume indicator on the prices
Coinigy don’t have that right?

3161 2018-01-03 20:43:57 I didn't think you were a ripple supporter bro?  Are you a ripple supporter but not and xrp supporter?

3166 2018-01-03 20:43:18 "Costly" is relative to marketcap. What you really want is room to grow to the marketcap you think it is worthy of achieving. I think both are great projects right now! VEN looks like it is taking off now.

3170 2018-01-03 20:43:02 I'll probably be sharing more crypto stuff on this Sitecore-burner account. :)
3171 2018-01-03 20:42:57 Quick shoutout for the folks backing up @CryptoFamTrust emails. Please be patient. Will be hiring a full time EA once I get back to Australia.
3172 2018-01-03 20:42:48 Doesn't that apply to any crypto?
3173 2018-01-03 20:42:47 Step 1: get out of crypto if you even think about buying $XRP

3184 2018-01-03 20:42:03 Firstly we should stop deciding if it's a bubble or not based on market cap determined by fiat value! The reason for developing crypto is decentralization and doing away with fiat.. why complicate this by comparing the fiat values of potentially amazing projects?
3185 2018-01-03 20:42:01 Preach!

3210 2018-01-03 20:40:27 I'd say the transactions aren't the problem, it's the speculation issue that's driving the increasing 'mining' activity (solving crypto puzzles) which is the huge power usage area. If transactions were really 200kwhr each, then they'd need to charge roughly $20 per transaction.
3211 2018-01-03 20:40:22 correct me if i am wrong: applied crypto research should be per sector focused, i.e. fin - related, gaming - related, etc. There can be common solutions between diff. sectors, however benchmarks and investments in research will be diff. in each sectors.
3212 2018-01-03 20:40:20 I would like all of #crypto Twitter to consider that $XRP is now worth more than 50% of $BTC

3216 2018-01-03 20:40:11 Not only is it important who you will work with, but who you won’t. Money ain’t shit when we get down to it.
3217 2018-01-03 20:40:10 From my understanding bitcoin was not designed to scale to the current level of volume that there is now. I haven't had any issues with other crypto like eth that are designed for higher volumes.
3218 2018-01-03 20:40:05 I thought Stellar would hit a dollar by March....but crypto markets are on speed right now -___-

3225 2018-01-03 20:39:39 It’s just so people can think they are investing in crypto but really are investing into something the BoE controls
3226 2018-01-03 20:39:38 You should concentrate on Crypto Currency
3227 2018-01-03 20:39:34 All I see are a bunch of centralized coin/tokens ready to scam most of the final investors out of a TON of money.  Stick with true decentralized crypto! #Bitcoin #Litecoin #Ethereum.
3228 2018-01-03 20:39:32 Is the  bubble concept as matter of fact for all businesses raising money before being breakeven,hence in production? The real problem should not be if no delivery at the end?is that a real issue at this stage of maturity of crypto?
3229 2018-01-03 20:39:29 I legit got no extra money. None. Its allllll going to crypto.
3230 2018-01-03 20:39:22 still deciding whether to increase $VEN or $ICX, the latter more costly currently but which do you think has potential to go further, both sound great to me from all i know and have read. tough call or just get bit more of both
3231 2018-01-03 20:39:18 Same here
3232 2018-01-03 20:39:08 Aha 1.6b I remember a few months ago it went from $4 to $11 then it dropped again lol. When the beta kicks off we’ll see treble figures

3236 2018-01-03 20:39:05 People are texting me, asking what coins to get into right now that are under a dollar.  These are the coins that are going to be seriously pumped. #crypto
3237 2018-01-03 20:39:04 Look how close minded you are. I’ve more than doubled my $ and have house money Sitting now. How all should be playing the crypto market it’s all smoke and mirrors right now
3238 2018-01-03 20:39:03 $pink got hit by a P&D group.. it also had some good news.
3239 2018-01-03 20:39:02 So bullish on silver. All these crypto kids dont know how to diversify. Precious metals and real estate are great long term investments; while Crpyto probably is as well, it is much riskier.

3245 2018-01-03 20:38:46 Hi @crypto_bobby . Do you plan to HODL them for long term or your gonna sell after a bit of a jump? Also what is your target for exiting them ?
3246 2018-01-03 20:38:43 You've gotta be pretty obsessive and desperate if you keep plugging in the wrong thread...  You're obvioulsy new to crypto.

3248 2018-01-03 20:38:36 Cenk bey bildiğiniz gibi sizi yakından takip ediyorum. Aklıma bir soru takıldı. 5.500.000.000 $ hacimli bir crypto para birimini 11 kişi nasıl yükseltebiliyorsunuz? Bunun için minimum 500 m $ lık bir sermaya gerekmez mi?
3249 2018-01-03 20:38:33 It would be great if I could actually access my damned funds! Mercatox is fucking with us bigtime.
3250 2018-01-03 20:38:29 Hopefully #Stellar can rise like #Ripple has been doing lately! That would be clutch!!

3252 2018-01-03 20:38:14 y invest in crypto if u can invest in alpha boost
3253 2018-01-03 20:38:14 Let’s look at the historical facts of dotcom bubble when the US stock market exploded during the bubble 1.5 trillion USD was lost in value. Why is crypto different? 1) market cap only 0.7 trillion 2) crypto is global not just US stock market 3) internet 3.0 and IoT
3254 2018-01-03 20:38:01 please add crypto coins as a payment method for @UpswingPoker
3255 2018-01-03 20:37:58 I know Bitcoin is not secure. The is another crypto they pushing that works solely on blockchain. It's secure as hell. They just not advertising it as much as bitcoin.
3256 2018-01-03 20:37:56 Well guess @gatehub isn’t responding to anyone and doesn’t work. Bought some #ripple back at .23 and now can’t get into account. Sucks bc I want to dump it. Scary thing about crypto is the uncertainty of possibly not being able to get into your account on exchanges. Never 100%
3257 2018-01-03 20:37:50 All my coins are goin up.
3258 2018-01-03 20:37:50 Will $TRX get to $0.10 and $XRP $3 today on #Binance?? I think it's possible!  Tearing down walls faster than they are being built... the crypto way.  #realworldsolutions #ripple #trx #xrp
3259 2018-01-03 20:37:47 Imma take that extra $3 and invest in crypto
3260 2018-01-03 20:37:43 What would you have dumped?? I only ever see gains! #ADA #XLM #XRP #TRX #crypto #altcoins

3262 2018-01-03 20:37:37 Should I dabble in my first crypto experience tonight for stream? I feel like it would be fun and you guys know a lot about it (more than I do LUL)
3263 2018-01-03 20:37:29 Ripple is the second most valuable digital currency as it roars past $3 according to Fortune and currently stands at a market capitalisation of $110 billion. Bitcoin may be king, but ripple is the dark horse in the crypto race.

3273 2018-01-03 20:36:59 @crypto_bobby my brotha! Currently looking at $dadi ICO, it's a decentralized web services platform. I heard about it because it might be partnering with RaiBlocks from stuff I've heard. Might be banging down doors on this soon ;) Looking forward to happy hour!
3274 2018-01-03 20:36:58 Guys coinbase SUCKS, i dont know why every single crypto n00b uses it.  No stop losses, only 4 coins, crashes like every time Bitcoin crashes.

N00bs, STOP USING COINBASE!!!
3275 2018-01-03 20:36:58 Nice bro, what are you making? I really want to make my own too, I'm so tired of mine.

Cicada et Tengri par contre, il faut un bon niveau en maths et une bonne compréhension de la crypto.
3278 2018-01-03 20:36:50 This project includes a number of best things: great team, great  product, great idea! I'm sure the company will occupy a leading place in  crypto industry #Bitroad #ICO #CryptoCurrencies #Bitcoin #ethereum
3279 2018-01-03 20:36:40 After mainnet launch VET will be in TOP 10 or even TOP 5. The biggest crypto player in 2018 .
3280 2018-01-03 20:36:40 Bitcoin is not a "solution for the poor" 
Crypto as a currency is a better option compared to fiat, especially for the poor because government can't steal it.
Free trade and good money do help the poorest among us, so I support those ideas.

3284 2018-01-03 20:36:28 Thanks mate 
3285 2018-01-03 20:36:23 Dont put 'crypto-currency trader' in your bio when you have £82.96 of bitcoin. Embarrassing
3286 2018-01-03 20:36:22 I actually do not prefer it to pop but to move up slowly every level. It just makes more sense than a pump and dump. $DGB has a better chance of surviving the long-term goals with peer to peer transactions. Will be implementing this crypto and a few others for my business.
3287 2018-01-03 20:36:20 You too. Let the crypto be with ya!
3288 2018-01-03 20:36:20 No I wish. Only a few months into crypto. Study macro and trade equities primarily. Still do but crypto is kinda my new obsession. Looking for a realistic replacement for this fiat system we’ve f’d up! It’s fascinating.

3295 2018-01-03 20:35:37 Thx! Yea we just don’t have enough cash!!! I actually sold some below $1 then had to fomo back in below $3. go figure. Would have more lol
3296 2018-01-03 20:35:37 #EtherDelta is officially a joke and should be ashamed of themselves. #ethereum #crypto

3302 2018-01-03 20:34:57 All out of $XRP from .50. What a ride. In $ICN, $ETH and cash now in crypto account

3304 2018-01-03 20:34:42 Yeaaaah!
3305 2018-01-03 20:34:41 We’ve seen peak crypto prices for a while. #startup #entrepreneur #innovate #AI #teachers #Cryptocurrency #blockchaintechnology
3306 2018-01-03 20:34:41 Great research again. Greatest crypto youtuber i found so far! Do you have a website or do you do private coaching for money or anything like that?
3307 2018-01-03 20:34:30 I love crypto currencies. Expecting 10x this year let’s go
3308 2018-01-03 20:34:27 #Ripple #XRP and #Stellar #XLM on fire today. Both up by 40%. #CrypDates -  never miss your price. #cryptocurrency #Crypto
3309 2018-01-03 20:34:26 It was bound to happen vele. Bitcoin was the prototype. Other more secure crypto are going to take over.
3310 2018-01-03 20:34:22 So its official: US Dollar is used for the majoity of illicit activities! #Crypto is the just innocent little brother
3311 2018-01-03 20:34:17 Can’t believe there’s been no goal so far. Both teams playing quite well, but the finishing so far has been terrible.
3312 2018-01-03 20:34:16 No one can give a solid advise about that, I was expecting a serious pump and it looks as it is started but its fully dominated by whales and if they want to surpress it, they just dump it
3313 2018-01-03 20:34:06 You forgot to put on your tinfoil hat. Start accepting that ripple is here to stay and is NOT the crypto devil. It is the coin we all wanted. Low fees and fast as it gets
3314 2018-01-03 20:33:57 any idea if the source is verified? nice pump tho
3315 2018-01-03 20:33:55 Part of me wants to start #crypto investment fund solely to help #noobs.  So many people in crypto don't know how to trade.  I truly feel for them.  Would say well over 90% of people trade the opposite the way they should. And it is the 10% that profit from them. #educateyourself
3316 2018-01-03 20:33:50 I’m an Aussie pleb, so probably molepeople, but I trade through a site called Coinspot, it’s actually super secure, but i think it’s AUS only, you probably have a few people in YogTowers who can tell you a good UK site. @alsmiffy or @trottimus was taking about crypto in HCOTW.
3317 2018-01-03 20:33:48 A lot of noobies to the #bitcoin and #cryptocurrency space look at #altcoins like they are new iterations of #crypto.  Each being bigger better faster.  In reality they are more like the multi-million $ idea-less, employee-less empty desk chair dot com companies of the late 90's
3318 2018-01-03 20:33:48 Would be so nice.
3319 2018-01-03 20:33:45 "Market Cap" should just be a byproduct of "Decentralization" as defined by @balajis
 
Decentralization should be the variable crypto is optimizing for, not market cap.

cc @zooko @hrdng
3320 2018-01-03 20:33:35 So what you're saying is we should buy XRP & Venezuela backed petro crypto?
3321 2018-01-03 20:33:33 $xrp #ripple  will be $5 dolar end of the month but do you want to end crypto with a centralize coin? The coin which used by banks. dont we agree on decentralize #cryptocurrency at first.. 
Dont sell yourself for x2 , there are many opportunities out there
3322 2018-01-03 20:33:32 新年早々 $JPY の暴落がヤバイけど大丈夫か？
3323 2018-01-03 20:33:30 If you don’t know what Coins you should be hodling you obviously don’t see the pattern that’s going on in the Crypto space
3324 2018-01-03 20:33:26 Considering that there isn’t a single reliable place to buy $XRB #RaiBlocks right now, it’s understandable why the price has dropped. I’d buy more if I could right now, say hello to Binance and KuCoin soon!

3326 2018-01-03 20:33:07 $GEO low-key has the best logo in crypto.

3328 2018-01-03 20:32:49 Looks like everyone turnt into crypto experts :)))))))))))))
3329 2018-01-03 20:32:47 Sold mine at $2.15 yesterday...SMH. On January 23rd is when Korea starts the new law for crypto regulations. Since Korea is so big on XRP, don't you think it will keep going up for the next few weeks?
3330 2018-01-03 20:32:45 BQX (Ethos) = “Probably a 100x”? This dude knows  @BQXStephen
3331 2018-01-03 20:32:44 #Fiat Global #DEBT headed towards $60T. #Crypto Global #VALUE headed towards $1T. What will be your choice for 2018 — DEBT or VALUE?
3332 2018-01-03 20:32:41 $Crypto market cap has gone up over $700 BILLION since I got into this space last April. It was $25 billion at that time.

3336 2018-01-03 20:32:09 Je mag dit hopen maar je kunt dit niet voorspellen gezien de volatiliteit van Crypto. Wel super dat gulden echt gaat doorontwikkelen met pow2 en dividend op gulden. Dat is m.i. echt uniek.

3346 2018-01-03 20:31:31 Ah yes, state run crypto currency, thus negating any point of it's existence. A great man once said "Impressive. Every word of that sentence was wrong."
3347 2018-01-03 20:31:25 Absolutely, we are in the last few stages of penny stock bubble in crypto world. It will all burst and money will flow back in Strang project. Just feel bad for millions of bag holders for years to come.

3361 2018-01-03 20:30:34 To be fair I wish people with this mindset werent into crypto. It's understandable many don't fully understand the tech, given its complexity. But to fail to understand the value of decentralisation? What sets you apart from a 15yr old with daddy's credit card at this point?
3362 2018-01-03 20:30:29 Cryptography as a means of achieving digital integrity - with money being an application of this - I think has a potentially huge future. Whether asymmetric crypto/blockchain/PoW etc are THE answer has to be treated as speculative & emergent.
3363 2018-01-03 20:30:27 Het kan helemaal niet instorten, hoogstens enorm dalen. Echter zijn er zoveel ontwikkelingen gaande, dat ik eerder groei zie. #bitcoin ontwikkeld zich ook door, andere crypto al helemaal. De beste zullen met Bitcoin veel gaan betekenen.

3373 2018-01-03 20:29:46 The only pin capable is that of another crypto demonstrating undeniable value in the minds of the masses. I think LN is well-poised to begin this process in 2018, but the real culling won’t begin until later this year or early 2019.

3377 2018-01-03 20:29:40 The constant troll-spam actually was a demonstration to me how poor their side of the argument was and pushed me, a relative newby, more into the Bitcoin Cash camp.
3378 2018-01-03 20:29:23 Good buys and great technologies.  Have been hodling them for a while now.   Excited to see some momentum. Really dig your work Bobby.  Keep up the awesome.  Maybe check out RaiBlocks too.  On a small dip at the moment.
3379 2018-01-03 20:29:18 That is great. Just hope they don't turn into something like the Zimbabwe dollars.. not in the immediate near future I am sure.
3380 2018-01-03 20:29:15 Stock market returns generally 10%-15% returns in a year. Cryptocurrency returns 400% in a month. But tell me more on how Im making poor financial decisions. #crypto #cryptocurrency #HODL #BTC

3394 2018-01-03 20:28:29 Great I m a crypto trader also we could be crypto friends what do you think?
3395 2018-01-03 20:28:26 People now call everything a crypto currency. If you can't build from source a full node and mine, it's as good as an iou
3396 2018-01-03 20:28:23 The mania in crypto right now is causing alot of impulsive behavior and a lot of noobs will get rekt because of it. I hope @DougPolkPoker takes the right path with his followers. The goal of #Bitcoin is to become the world's reseve currency, long after alts fall to 0 value.
3397 2018-01-03 20:28:15 Make sure to align it nicely with a difficulty adjustment. We want usable crypto currencies not crypto-store-of-values

3408 2018-01-03 20:27:37 Hi Jason, would be interested in content on the intersection of crypto and magick.
3409 2018-01-03 20:27:25 $XRP surprises yet again. It was is and will remain once of my longer term holds. Take partial profits so you can buy more at a cheaper price. $crypto
3410 2018-01-03 20:27:14 So since the artificial cap is going to have it functing like gold, which crypto is likely to be the daily spend that could challenge the major fiat currencies?

3425 2018-01-03 20:25:42 Which is the decentralized part of bitcoin, the Wells Fargo Lightning Hubs or the whining to get key players to adopt segwit?  Centralization failure X2.
3426 2018-01-03 20:25:40 He's right... that is what the free market creates. If banks don't pass along the savings, non-banks will and steal customers. Banks will have to adapt or die.

3432 2018-01-03 20:24:56 I rejoined Twitter after a hiatus with the hope that it will help me learn the fundamentals. So far though, I'm mostly just seeing dick measuring contests on my TL. Back to Babypips.
3433 2018-01-03 20:24:56 Nah I'm already up 100k this year, I'm set
3434 2018-01-03 20:24:54 Are you guys accepting crypto yet?
3435 2018-01-03 20:24:50 Good day for #xrp #ripple, glad I jumped on at £1.67 yesterday. 

Currently priced at £2.34 
3436 2018-01-03 20:24:46 Yeah same here mate, I'm holding for the long term however I have sold some not long ago to get what I put in. Now its all profit 
3437 2018-01-03 20:24:35 Lessons from #Ripple Never underestimate the power of normie hype. Over sold? No one gives a shit. It's magical crypto and it will make you rich. End of thought process. #ripplexrp #cryptocurrency #XRP
3438 2018-01-03 20:24:31 One main reason why XRP is pumping is clueless newcomers getting into the space are attracted to the "low cost" of a top 5 crypto asset. Driven by greed alone and no philosophy.

3445 2018-01-03 20:24:23 @myetherwallet good lord you guys have a wildly unintuitive wallet...its amazing. I didnt know a crypto wallet could be so underdeveloped and hard to navigate. Here’s an idea - you guys have absolutely blown up in the past year, so ffs MAKE THE EFFORT TO REMODEL UR WEBSITE.
3446 2018-01-03 20:24:23 VTC is almost ready again. Nice bull flag on the across midterm timeframes (4 hr, 1 D etc.)
3447 2018-01-03 20:24:18 Are you expecting any dips coming week(s) Ed? Price did not stabilize after latest major news coming out (Apotheosis Part II) but continued to rise instead. Looking to buy.
3448 2018-01-03 20:24:17 Dépassé le bitcoin c'est chaud mais investir dans des crypto utile ( le ripple ). Oui c'est pour le coup intéressant
3449 2018-01-03 20:24:13 My crypto portfolio is nice and diversified now. Time to HODL while I focus on my stock portfolio. Brb
3450 2018-01-03 20:24:11 Waqar bahi you are nice person and honest but this crypto doesn’t seem good in a life to get successful there is no short cut just plz Becareful guys just simple msg

3453 2018-01-03 20:24:06 De bitcoin is een bijzonder succesvol "proof of concept" en jazeker, de frauduleuze valuta zoals de door fractioneel bankieren verstrekte Euro en Dollar, zullen eerder dan verwacht worden vervangen door een crypto variant.

3459 2018-01-03 20:23:52 Fair enough and all power to your beliefs etc. However there are 1000+ coins we can get involved in, @Ripple is just one of them. However, try telling that to someone who paid 0.006 cent for 1 a year ago and see if they care about it being centralised or not. That's not me btw!!!

3483 2018-01-03 20:22:08 Well done
3484 2018-01-03 20:22:07 I bought into XRP early, so it’s done well for me. It’s not crypto currency in the form of BTC/ETH/etc. but it has its value and might be a bridge from current money to crypto.
3485 2018-01-03 20:22:07 @Plus500 first and last time I investige money in plius500 , before  3 month buy some crypto Coints ,  connecting after  3 month look what profit I have  and guess what I found.....   0 money all gone. Nice experience with plius500. 
People be careful with this....

3489 2018-01-03 20:21:44 As portfolio value increases the risk tolerance of many young investors will decrease. Hard to hold 90%+ in crypto when you have huge windfall of money you never had before & your witnessing bubble formations

This was fascinating.

3500 2018-01-03 20:20:53 $BAT will be $10 by end of 2018 and $50 by end of 2019. No one thought BTC would be $18k last year, and $BAT has a solid roadmap, solid team and solid CEO who was founder of Firefox and creator of JavaScript. Crypto market is going to blast in 2 years.

3504 2018-01-03 20:20:33 Shill it baby shill it
3505 2018-01-03 20:20:29 huh? are you really implying that you and your gang getting less money somehow hurts me? I'm dying over here from taxes and debt and all you've done is bailed out the very bank that's demanding money from me now. No thanks, i'll stick with voting for crypto over you guys.
3506 2018-01-03 20:20:29 You have a donation address for a crypto coin (s)?
3507 2018-01-03 20:20:10 Because they aren’t traders. They are posers and players ripping content to get that little rush. I think most of them work 9-5 and just check in to try stay relevant

3510 2018-01-03 20:19:58 I hope Doug realizes the reason why Bitcoin is the only valuable crypto is because no one can change its economic rules. If a few people in a room decide to launch a coin then they have missed the point from the start. I agree with @saifedean on all his points reqarding altcoins
3511 2018-01-03 20:19:52 Hey!!!!  And I’m glad you are starting to get into crypto !  I use Quadrigacx which is the Canadian alternative to Coinbase.  Then from there you can send your coins to an exchange like Binance or Bittrex if you want to buy coins other than Bitcoin.
3512 2018-01-03 20:19:44 how are you successful in med school and still have the time to keep up with crypto? @misskennedys i can only do one at once.
3513 2018-01-03 20:19:35 Start small, try out different strategies and once you know what works for you to be consistently profitable, add more capital. There's no one size fits all approach unfortunately.
3514 2018-01-03 20:19:26 Beating my meat just isn’t as satisfying as beating the crypto market
3515 2018-01-03 20:19:22 What buzz words should one know if they want to start mining crypto?
3516 2018-01-03 20:19:14 Have you localized any stories on crypto? Was thinking about doing one myself.
3517 2018-01-03 20:19:12 I think Ripple is doing well without Coinbase. I don't want to see with Ripple the same that happens with Bcash.
3518 2018-01-03 20:18:59 Yes sad to say I got sucked into the $NXT $IGNIS Airdrop scam. Bought a pumped coin for a dumped coin and still don’t have the dumped coin. Dumb. #Bittrex #Ignis #NXT #BTC #Crypto
3519 2018-01-03 20:18:52 My own moonbags can be higher than 50%, based on the fundamental exit conditions I set when I entered and how good my entry was to begin with.
3520 2018-01-03 20:18:52 Buying a starter position in $QLC.  Also picked up a small position in $BLUE, $BLUE is a blockchain security play listed on coinexchange and is a true microcap.. some potential to make outsized gains! My lotto ticket of the quarter, looking for 10x plus.  #crypto #altcoins $btc

3523 2018-01-03 20:18:49 2018 Goal: Trade crypto and build up to a $50k+ portfolio.

3524 2018-01-03 20:18:44 Wait till it dumps. Watch and learn.
3525 2018-01-03 20:18:39 And thank you. For providing one of the best resources I have seen in crypto and for being genuinely some of the best people in space.
3526 2018-01-03 20:18:25 I know ..its gonna be massive..but its gonna lose its useability... and i believe $xrp is the top useable crypto right now ..i just want people to see the power of crypto in real world..and i believe only $xrp can do that..i hope you guys know what i mean
3527 2018-01-03 20:18:21 My heart just exploded. I’m a lawyer with my own firm in California and my partner and I are spending insane amounts of time focused on Blockchain, business law and women minded. Super happy to find you all!

3535 2018-01-03 20:17:31 There’s a fun phenomenon in crypto coin markets — people lean toward “cheap” coins in absolute dollar value per unit. It’s highly irrational but also might lead to interesting predictable/gameable correlations in prices that aren’t applicable to other markets. gl&hf
3536 2018-01-03 20:17:30 Starting to unfollow some crypto veterans who at best only talk about shitcoins and at worst spew hate and bile. These dudes will be so irrelevant soon. Honestly, I think that is their greatest fear. It would be a fate worse than poverty.

3556 2018-01-03 20:16:07 Man, I really need to roll some profits into some small bags of these micro caps.  I kept feeling like I had too many bags already, but why not throw a little bit into all of these? Those starts look insane.  Yay taxes...

3563 2018-01-03 20:15:38 Question for the #crypto experts: What is the best strategy to benefit from the x100 growth in 2018?

3572 2018-01-03 20:14:58 "Centrálna banka zasiahne až vtedy, keď kryptomeny začnú meniť správanie ľudí. Zatiaľ k tomu nedošlo." #ECB #Crypto
3573 2018-01-03 20:14:53 Most governments, as you say, do not want BTC. But Prez Putin just a few days ago asked Finance Ministry & Central Bank to consider a 'crypto-ruble'. Why? He wants to use it to evade sanctions.
3574 2018-01-03 20:14:52 Who cares? Governmental bureaucratic bullshit. Exactly what crypto is trying to crush. This statement mainly hurts US investors. I’ll risk my money wherever the fuck I want too. #Crypto #Altcoins #BTC
3575 2018-01-03 20:14:51 Crypto. :)
3576 2018-01-03 20:14:45 They are not targeting this community.  They are trying to scare  everyone outside of this community by associating $Crypto with Nazi's.  This is not news.  It is propaganda. #fakenews
3577 2018-01-03 20:14:43 Totally understand but if you have any spare cash you’re willing to forget for a few years it could be the best decision you ever make. I put far less in crypto than I did FI and am making far more. Computer based international currencies are here to stay
3578 2018-01-03 20:14:41 And another woman in crypto! I’m having the best day finding cryptophenoms.
3579 2018-01-03 20:14:39 People are so cheap. It's insane

I bet you'll still make use of our 'joke'
3585 2018-01-03 20:14:26 I didn't even invest regularly before crypto and even then I knew that 0.50% gains were shit.
3586 2018-01-03 20:14:16 そうですか笑
しかし、まずは本当に上場するかですね。
私は上場でさえすれば、今の仮想通貨の流れからしてうまく行くと信じているのですが。
3587 2018-01-03 20:14:16 You may want to get out. This is a bank facilitated ponzi its not a real crypto. The banks themselves don;t even use it. The banks invest directly in the company not in the token. glad you were able to take advantage!
3588 2018-01-03 20:14:16 Will there be a separate confirmation if my application for whitelist has been accepted ?

3594 2018-01-03 20:13:40 Everyday brings a new rule for any Crypto which the leaders of the world don't know what to do with.  They don't know if it is a commodity, Currency, Asset, Fiat  or Database.  How can you regulate without it being defined.
3595 2018-01-03 20:13:39 Doesn’t the transaction lock in the then-current price of whatever it is you are purchasing/selling? (I’m assuming we’re talking about the same thing [Crypto])
3596 2018-01-03 20:13:39 Comprei esse, @erimoitinho
3597 2018-01-03 20:13:35 True. But as stated a thousand times before, you never know with crypto.
3598 2018-01-03 20:13:32 Hi, My dream is to get 100$ worth of crypto can you help me please?
3599 2018-01-03 20:13:31 So you would rather use a coin that takes hours to confirm and is way more expensive? Lmao go ahead.
3600 2018-01-03 20:13:31 Ok will do. Thanks!
3601 2018-01-03 20:13:30 I am so excited for the incredible opportunities that cryptocurrencies bring in 2018, it is going to be the best year so far!

3602 2018-01-03 20:13:25 Don’t get your hopes to high on crypto guys. @Daytrader213 is right. Is good if you can make some money speculating but everything is limited by the exchanges ability convert the coins in cash. And since exchanges are regulated....a run on them will crash the market.
3603 2018-01-03 20:13:23 Even with quite a bit of experience under my belt already, I learned that lesson yet again with $Xlm on Christmas of all days.  Missed out on a nice little 4-5x before I decided to look for another entry point a few days ago, glad I got it.  Ever-growing...

3610 2018-01-03 20:12:54 I find it ironic that productivity at many silicon valley mega companies and startups is nosediving, due to people checking their crypto, which in turn will hasten those companies’ demise, due to the rise of the world of crypto

3613 2018-01-03 20:12:45 No that would be stupid, why bother give free crypto currency to people who don't value the currency aspect? Lol, how silly

3615 2018-01-03 20:12:36 $XRP is going up due to all the new money in the market following #hype. It's #centralized and they have the ability to freeze accounts. Even if it surpasses $BTC in market share the real #crypto community will not accept it. Traders are playing it but only to make a gain in $BTC
3616 2018-01-03 20:12:22 Awesome giveaway!!! Thanks for sharing with the community
3617 2018-01-03 20:11:56 True. I used to be in music industry. This ripple debate reminds me when mp3s came along. Purists were saying Apple will take the market share etc and cds better sound quality. All very true however end user doesn’t care. Purists always lose financially.
3618 2018-01-03 20:11:52 Tai plz don't let any haters take up any of your valuable time. You are a huge asset to crypto. Smart traders are listening to you, not looking to pick a fight. You're the man!

3620 2018-01-03 20:11:43 @Truth_Investor When do you think the whole market cap for crypto will hit 1 trillion? Looks like it may be quite soon. And what type of mental effects do you think that will have on the industry? Could be a video topic even.
3621 2018-01-03 20:11:42 $ITC Ya peach! So much potential for this project... $IOTA sitting at $11B, whilst ITC, even now, just $300M.

3629 2018-01-03 20:11:12 Ahmed, thanks for being in crypto and speaking out. Some of these dudes getting drunk on their power think it’s hip to adopt an ignorant posture. Point it out, whenever you see it. 
3630 2018-01-03 20:11:03 sometimes i say i have strong hands and hodl awesomely but really i just fell asleep on the couch and took a long nap #cryptocurrency #crypto
3631 2018-01-03 20:10:58 Lot of folks saying bad things about @Ripple because it's centralized. Decentralized tools & currencies are the end goal, but don't miss the big picture. We only get there by enabling our traditional institutions with new crypto technologies. This way, everyone wins.
3632 2018-01-03 20:10:51 @BitcoinBravado I paid and did not receive buy list. Please refund my fee

3643 2018-01-03 20:10:07 LTC is run by amateurs. Smart dudes, but no common sense. ETH on on fire tho. @VitalikButerin understands economics, crypto, politics, and programming.
3644 2018-01-03 20:10:05 Just like China, they want their own crypto to control.

People be careful with this....
3648 2018-01-03 20:09:58 @raiblocks why dont you guys list XRB on another exchange?? it looks fishy if you keep sticking to these 2 sites (mercatox and bitgrail) when they are both suspicious & keep going down and giving trouble to customers... you need to find another exchange or you will LOSE big time
3649 2018-01-03 20:09:55 When do you usually think it's a good time to take profits and wait for a crypto to come down? Seen all kinds of different takes on it, even for the same crypto.

3665 2018-01-03 20:08:16 Again #Ripple is the network, it's token is #XRP, but regardless it's a shit coin that defeats #Satoshi's original image of decentralization. SMH
3666 2018-01-03 20:08:15 @YahooFinance loving the crypto coverage but would love to hear about other big trends like marijuana stocks in the Final Round
3667 2018-01-03 20:08:09 Damn, too bad. Still going to keep following you tho. #hodlVerge
3668 2018-01-03 20:08:01 Totally new to crypto..So might be a dumb question, but here you go:
What is Silver, I don't see any such coin in coinmarketcap. Where can I find it?
3669 2018-01-03 20:07:57 Tu régales, merci khey
3670 2018-01-03 20:07:51 Doubled my investemet in #Ripple XRP in 5 days! Good call! Who wants to learn this #Crypto stuff?  message me. 2018 is gonna be HUGE!
3671 2018-01-03 20:07:37 Watch $XVG closely. It's setting up for another ride, the verge surge is ON! #Crypto #HODL #WraithProtocol #XVG #Verge
3672 2018-01-03 20:07:31 Similar. Glad I followed my own path and ignored the many naysayers along the way...
3673 2018-01-03 20:07:25 probably ~$50-100k to launch a crypto asset/utility token this time last year. This year easily ~$500k-1M to get it out there and "hope" to sell tokens.
3674 2018-01-03 20:07:25 Gonna’ start slingin’ pizzas for crypto currency.
3675 2018-01-03 20:07:24 it would be wise of @coindesk and their "journalists" to at the very least reach out to the source (Ripple) and perhaps get their perspective/rebuttal on these claims before releasing articles like this -- how is this not common practice? blows my mind
3676 2018-01-03 20:07:21 Also, when u talk about other coins being faster, does the average person care? @Ripple is arguably next to instant, if something is a mili second quicker, in what scenario does that actually matter?
3677 2018-01-03 20:07:21 better u remember when it actually does... 
3678 2018-01-03 20:07:13 yep, up.
3679 2018-01-03 20:07:07 as I mentioned I missed a lot of slyrocking shots but I was believing in it, I was just cautious since I’m a student. Now I knew that my predictions were true. Trying now to bring all capital from Saudi to crypto.Meanwhile, beaing a cryptobroker for the people in Saudi.
3680 2018-01-03 20:07:04 Glad I invested in all 3 #iota #cardano and my favorite #ripple I am obsessed  with #Crypto
3681 2018-01-03 20:07:04 What the media is showing in middle east about crypto and why some people have a bad idea about it
3682 2018-01-03 20:07:01 I think so. And then for newer coins I'd look at $sphtx $vee
3683 2018-01-03 20:06:58 seiyaさんにそう言ってもらえると心強いです。
私も2btcほど突っ込み、スキャムとか悪い噂聞くたびに内心ビクビクしてしまってますので。
3684 2018-01-03 20:06:54 Its crazy, crypto is in such high demands in some area like korea that their prices are a good 25% higher. Especially ripple!
3685 2018-01-03 20:06:49 In the CryptoCurrencies market everything is possible, we are in a very early stage when changes are happening every day, a twitt, a statement, a misunderstanding, traders inexperience can globally drive markets to the unknown, but this is the good thing of #crypto...
3686 2018-01-03 20:06:35 @gems! Is a really awesome project that can disrupt the Crypto world!
3687 2018-01-03 20:06:33 @CryptoDale such a gem
3688 2018-01-03 20:06:28 This will be a big year for crypto so many alt coins have me trippin! Don’t sleep on the wave 
3689 2018-01-03 20:06:21 Words like noobs-shitcoin-rekt will become the most used words in crypto tweets in 1Q2018 :)

3691 2018-01-03 20:06:11 Ahh the old crypto currency game, is it too late to join? I feel like I’ve well and truly missed the boat on this one!
3692 2018-01-03 20:06:07 Agreed. It's recent news and coinbase being factored in for sure. My payment example was just another reason that will go into its price as thats what most newcomers especially will believe about @Ripple
3693 2018-01-03 20:06:05 these idiots are as stubborn as they are green

3695 2018-01-03 20:05:58 Crypto market cap soon will be bigger than Google market cap.
3696 2018-01-03 20:05:56 Thinking about starting a Blockchain/Crypto meet up in my local city.  I then plan on making #Bitcoin maximalists out of all those that attend.    Noobs obviously need help.  They are getting brainwashed by idiots on youtube telling them to buy shitcoins.  This will be easy 
3697 2018-01-03 20:05:50 Well my crypto portfolio has well and truly recovered, for now... glad I #hodl'd the way through. That punt on $XRP has well and truly paid off.
3698 2018-01-03 20:05:48 It is already bigger than bitcoin if you include the $180bn tokens that the owners have. Total marketcap $300bn+

Seriously, for how much longer do you think we will rely on paper money and centralized systems to exchange value? 

Not much longer. Trust me on this.

3735 2018-01-03 20:03:20 @zcashco How does #zcash separate itself from Monero? Considering on Monero all transactions are private by default?
3736 2018-01-03 20:03:12 There are already billions out there.  Do some reading on their website and some Googling about it.  I am all in. This is the only Crypto that has any merit in my mind.  It is still cheap enough that the casual investor will be able to buy in.
3737 2018-01-03 20:03:10 It’s a good thing I didn’t splurge on a new computer with all my phat crypto winningz.

Take this as a lesson. Never invest in crypto what you can't afford to lose. Diversify your investments.
You only lose when you sell. Only 20% of traders make real money, the other 80% lose.

3818 2018-01-03 19:58:12 I use "theoretical math" . 191 MIllion IFT.  Twitter is worth 18 Billion. If IFT becomes 1/10th of twitter ( 1.8 Billion)  1.8B /191M= $9.42   I try to look at things from a somewhat realistic point of view. But with the insanity of crypto it could go much higher.

3878 2018-01-03 19:54:16 Agreed but i wouldnt put Ripple in that as the original post suggested. markets, traders etc don't care about if something is centralised or controlled by banks etc. If it works, it works. If there is something better then the market will do the talking.

3904 2018-01-03 19:52:49 It looks like with the all time highs of $Xrp and $Eth today, $Btc has been completely forgotten and has barely moved.  I think in order for mass investment in crypto $Btc needs to skyrocket asap as it’s the most famous.

3923 2018-01-03 19:51:43 On the real...if used properly...twitter can do alot of crypto research for you. You can search cashtags and see what people are saying about a coin and even find articles for more information.
3924 2018-01-03 19:51:42 but not at the level that twitter is for news, commentary, threads, and interactions I think. Facebook has value but very different than twitter

3946 2018-01-03 19:50:19 Today I attempted to start my crypto currency journey...
3947 2018-01-03 19:50:07 @robotodd There seems to be an issue with #Bitsane taking cryptocurrencies for crypto-crypto exchanges but not depositing the coins in their online wallet. Several complaints are showing up accusing them of stealing transactions & these are documented by various blockchains.
3948 2018-01-03 19:50:04 @Haejin_Crypto
3949 2018-01-03 19:50:01 Ethereum bientôt bitcoin bis. Monero ripple. En regardant l'essentiel des crypto augmentent. Puis ce qui fera la diff c'est le but des monnaies. D'lu le ripple je pense ça va grossir quand de + en + de banque l'utiliseront...
3950 2018-01-03 19:50:01 2018 is going to be a great year for crypto. I can feel it in my plums

3967 2018-01-03 19:49:06 @haydentiff  - Crypto is quite popular in the region. Many of my friends have heavily invested in crypto (some with 100% XRP) - Kraken/CEX and Binance, Etoro have been super popular here. Don't expect much jump from this BitOasis move as its reputation is already pretty bad.

3978 2018-01-03 19:48:27 Every crypto coin is undervalued and always will be undervalued. Ripple for example you thought the top was $1 now it’s $2 wait now $3? What’s next $4 $5 $6 $7?
3979 2018-01-03 19:48:14 I will. Hell, I'll even do it for free.

3993 2018-01-03 19:47:39 Might??
3994 2018-01-03 19:47:35 This shit right here makes my head hurt. FFS, #XRP is a centralized token, which defeats its purpose as a #cryptocurrency. Ripple has no incentive to benefit their investors. Now you have CNBC telling people to wrongly invest in shit.

4011 2018-01-03 19:45:45 This is not the failure of coin. At the moment, Crypto Market is full of greedy people who are looking for multiplying profits overnight. No coin can make them rich overnight not even Bitcoin.

People Sometimes even divorce their Wives ( Life Partners ) on suspect.
4012 2018-01-03 19:45:45 I can agree with all crypto, except bitcoin, eth, litecoin and Monero. which in my opinion are not shitcoin, since they have real world use.

4024 2018-01-03 19:45:10 Bitcoin already has an enormous quantity of people who spend a huge amount of money to mine coins and make a fortune. It is not easy for them to accept change from the government, government can only restrict the process of mining due to its huge energy consumption, not crypto
4025 2018-01-03 19:44:58 LTC is #5 in total crypto $volume of transactions today at 4.82% of total volume. That is impressive.

4035 2018-01-03 19:44:30 Good thing about #crypto is that what is actually really GOOD, on the long run works better. People who will take bad decisions and accept money with bad properties will be in disadvantage to those who do not. Some things are very obvious, other not so much and time will tell...

4038 2018-01-03 19:44:19 Btw, tangentially speaking ,isn't it also d handiwork of a fu Families along wit Nordics ?

+ Getting it listed on a certain Trading XChange 
+Facelift in Mid East Kingdon ?
4039 2018-01-03 19:44:17 what kind of math is it ?

5K $  × 1.8 M =  ONLY 9 B $

Cardano (ADA) is 28 B $. 
No 10 DASH is 9 B $.

It is diffucult but not impossible in crypto market.

$zcl comes to 110$ from 4 $ in 10 days.

after fork date and bittrex support announce same ratio it can go to 3.000 $

4041 2018-01-03 19:44:13 so @TokenHash , what about theory of big banks "stealing"BTC & ETH via selling XRP, everyone feeling rich as it goes to $4.00, $6.00 and ????,  then pulling rug out and dumping XRP from whatever level down to $0.30 cents again?  And banks would then have all the sheeps BTC.

4121 2018-01-03 19:38:51 But this is one of my biggest concerns that bitcoin and other currencies presently don't seem to address. Value that can't be abstracted as currency has no perceived value in present system or crypto system.

4258 2018-01-03 19:28:56 $strat is my biggest bag, I know it's gonna moon at some point, both TA & FA are so bullish, but goddamn it's taking its time
4259 2018-01-03 19:28:50 @CoinbaseSupport - Coinbase status states that there are no reported issues with Crypto. My last ETH send has been pending for 2.5 hours and hasn't reached the blkchain yet. Please update the status page.
4260 2018-01-03 19:28:43 #Share as much factual crypto data as possible for the greater good.
4261 2018-01-03 19:28:36 there is a major FUD in the middle eastern media about crypto and it keeps talking how its used by criminals and shit hopefully they will get what its really about soon
4262 2018-01-03 19:28:35 lol the mentioned bags on my name don't represent me. I don't even have four of them
4263 2018-01-03 19:28:35 @mrBobbyBones is now into Crypto. My man! Now start looking into alt coins. Ride the crypto wave better than a long board :)

4267 2018-01-03 19:28:07 And with that kind of money in crypto a billion supply would be nothing

4270 2018-01-03 19:27:55 Indeed. Some African nations are moving towards crypto-economies backed by natural resources, as well as Venezuela's petro-backed crypto currency & the Russo-Chinese connection def have something up their sleeves. You see any feasibility for a Pan-African or BRIC crypto come up?
4271 2018-01-03 19:27:51 The next big crypto play: diversify out.
4272 2018-01-03 19:27:49 Once the devs have officially announced the launch and are ready to pump their marketting avenues the price will sky rocket because after all.....freedom of choice and privacy was why crypto was created in the first place!!

4279 2018-01-03 19:27:15 Ok, so investing in tech like Ethereum isn't the sexiest thing. But neither should be non-mineable coins. Ethereum solves this by being a mineable coin while also being an intermediate layer between non-mineables & mining. Full disclosure, I've created my own Crypto on Ethereum.
4280 2018-01-03 19:27:14 guys show some respect please i'm a muslim and i'm into crypto among many others don't troll a whole religion for this so all the media shows that crypto is used for criminal activities,drugs money& bla bla that's what this is based on from his pov

4295 2018-01-03 19:26:29 You shut your whore mouth
 I need more ETH
4296 2018-01-03 19:26:25 Ignore the FUD surrounding $XVG and realize that this coin is an asset with so much potential to change the future of currency. It is the most private coin on the market and that is truly going to be a game changer in the years to come in the crypto sphere.
4297 2018-01-03 19:26:20 Listened to a crypto podcast then had to add three more to my podcast queue to understand what they were talking about in the first one. #cryptolife
4298 2018-01-03 19:26:17 A lot of people will learn the economics their school system didn't explain to them, the hard way in crypto. 
In essence, the cutting of budgets in education, will cause many people to work for free for the 1%. A perfectly rotten system.
Let's destroy it.
4299 2018-01-03 19:26:14 The more research I did on ARK the more convinced I became that it was a sleeping giant. It’s not been pumped either. Seems too serious a project. I traded through the dot com era too. I’m not new to this. It’ll do 30-50 by summer. In my opinion.

4308 2018-01-03 19:25:49 Satoshi created BTC and he has like 1M BTC without any effort or super computer to mine them at that time!! And until today nobody knows who Satoshi is! At least we know who is behind Ripple!  All the crypto currencies have the same kinda pattern! End of story!
4309 2018-01-03 19:25:43 Its a damn cheap coin for what it is. Your freedom of choice a d privacy for 15c a coin.....how om earth someones managed to crrate fudd around that is beyond me.....
4310 2018-01-03 19:25:42 only thing i got from this tweet is that $BTC fucking sucks
4311 2018-01-03 19:25:33 I love this guy. The majority of our crypto is invested in ETH but I do wonder, like his parody account, if he’s taking the piss.
4312 2018-01-03 19:25:24 In $CRYPTO people are so impatient you can buy the top on a cycle and still be earlier than the next wave of fomo market participants. 

Love it.
4313 2018-01-03 19:25:22 Crypto is a crazy space, and it will change the world. Bitcoin was just the first example of Blockchains eliminating middlemen. Blockchain tech is the real invention. Middlemen in every industry should be scared, a new world is coming.

4364 2018-01-03 19:21:47 Para eso tendría que tener el mismo marketcap que $BTC ahora mismo. Y recuerda que es controlada por los bancos, y pueden siempre manipular el precio. Yo creo que más temprano que tarde caerá/la harán caer

4379 2018-01-03 19:20:40 @themarketline Low float and stock price elevated too quickly. Coupled with volatile crypto currency, sharks showed up.
4380 2018-01-03 19:20:33 That I don't agree with.  I think the cocky-yet-naive crypto-anarchist guy has a lot of good points, especially insofar as producers realizing their own power and circumventing the labels is concerned.
4381 2018-01-03 19:20:33 Yep, same login works on the new wallets. However, it's advised you create a test wallet while it's still in beta and only use small amounts for now.
4382 2018-01-03 19:20:31 OMG PEOPLE NEED TO STOP TALKING ABOUT CRYPTO
4383 2018-01-03 19:20:26 6 figures at the top.401(k), ETO, paid holidays for benefits. Who knows what other kind of money they could move through crypto in that position of knowing passwords and a massive spy network. Future threat?
4384 2018-01-03 19:20:22 Firstly, I don't think banks will adopt ripple en masse. Too much exposure/risk. Secondly, no entity (unless it's a central bank) is legally safe. The .gov will want their share, and so will the banks.  Eventualities in the new crypto world are yet to be known.  Eggs = 1 basket
4385 2018-01-03 19:20:19 Dear banks and billionaires, #Bitcoin is definitely a scam. Please avoid at all cost. Dimon is right. Trust in him. Do not buy any more bitcoin (until I can stack a few more btc).
4386 2018-01-03 19:20:18 So how long can we go with no official news on ripple being added to coinbase before people give up and it crashes? $omg $ok #ltc $pay $neo $qtum $ltc $wtc #btc $btc $wtc $btg $bch $strat $xrp $ada $xlm
4387 2018-01-03 19:20:15 In #XRP #Ripple the "network fees" are paid through burning tokens. Every token that is burned will proportionally enrich everyone that is currently holding Ripple. Guess who #HODL 's the most? Why Ripple Labs or course!! This is concerning... 
#cryptocurrency #crypto
4388 2018-01-03 19:20:08 These next 3-4 months will show how the crypto market will grow and last, once tax returns are done on an individual and corporate level, a decent percentage of that will go into the market..  #staytuned #cryptocurrency #adoptionphase

4408 2018-01-03 19:18:34 Ppl who dont know shit about crypto charging ppl who dont know shit about crypto ... tragic
4409 2018-01-03 19:18:28 Sadly they cannot control what others who invest in this crypto do or say on Twitter. That guy you talking about helped boost the price, but shit happens. It will only get better from here.
4410 2018-01-03 19:18:23 The funny thing about crypto is: imagine telling your 12 year old self that you are paying money for imaginary coins, then trading these for other imaginary coins.
4411 2018-01-03 19:18:23 and 2$ in 3months
4412 2018-01-03 19:18:23 Looking to invest in Crypto currency but no idea where to start. Any hints/ tips peeps?

4422 2018-01-03 19:17:58 i sold my steem on $3 now they are %9. I wish that could be rather ripple hah. DOn't regret man. That's the way crypto works. If they don't use the weak hands to get stronger there won't be good boost control. Wait some days it will jump for sure.
4423 2018-01-03 19:17:56 Get in on $DRGN now! Best thing about crypto is if you miss one window, another one is open and waiting elsewhere. Now is the time for #DragonChain
4424 2018-01-03 19:17:54 if you still have any fiat money in bank
you will be smart to invest in crypto

4426 2018-01-03 19:17:48 I missed nothing. I have loads of crypto and I don't want to see it gobbled up by the crooked Ripple slave coin. The only people that need XRP are the ones trying to take control of all our money.
4427 2018-01-03 19:17:30 Yes this is incredible innovation
4428 2018-01-03 19:17:27 To the people excited about XRP trying to surpass BTC, do we really want the most centralized coin to be top Dog? I think not...

Because you fucking shorted it at the wrong spot then forgot about it a "tad" too long... THAT's why.

4440 2018-01-03 19:16:26 Developers of most cryptocurrencies usually only keep a fraction of the tokens for themselves and pre-sell the rest to the public. #XRP #Ripple, however, still owns about 60% of the originally issued tokens. This should raise a few concerns...

And i think over 12 mio units is not small but i still wish that recover..
4448 2018-01-03 19:15:49 na if you had just bought nearly any 4 random non scam coins on dec 8th and held, you would have at least x3'd ur money to this date. most people in crypto have no idea how to day trade and just buy and hold. they still get ~30% weekly gains.

4464 2018-01-03 19:15:04 One thing to remember about $XRP .. banks deal in the TRILLIONS not just billions.  So when you think about the $100b market cap it's really small right now in terms of potential growth.  #Ripple is helping make crypto legit.. it's helping crypto come out of the shadows.

4472 2018-01-03 19:14:25 While Coinbase have 13m users... they're small potatoes compared to the market Ripple is addressing. Coinbase, especially after the $BCH debacle, don't have that much room to wiggle -- I mean, could you see the crypto community buying Coinbasecoin? Why?

4514 2018-01-03 19:11:52 MiFID II won’t immediately impact crypto all that much. The idea behind mifid ii revolves around using customer dollars for research and achieving best execution. Neither will play much into Crypto’s until the regulators latch on. Not many funds paying for crypto research.

4521 2018-01-03 19:11:22 10 x increase in xrp last month being a case in point... Definitely spreading an investment across the top 20 for this year and HODLing

4523 2018-01-03 19:11:20 I don’t think you are able to withdraw crypto currencies from etoro. Use an exchange like Binance instead.

4531 2018-01-03 19:10:36 With $5k, should I diversify or find 2-3 projects still 'undervalued'?
4532 2018-01-03 19:10:36 any real crypto buyers willing to swap their real cryptos for a bank $ripple?  not likely
4533 2018-01-03 19:10:27 Can US citizens still participate in ICOs? Heard we need to have a 5 million dollar Net worth?
4534 2018-01-03 19:10:23 This is super true!
4535 2018-01-03 19:10:21 haha yeah especially when 1 week in crypto is equivalent to 1 year in real life!
4536 2018-01-03 19:10:05 Trx fall under that or what. What this mean g
4537 2018-01-03 19:09:59 これ、最近の悩みですw
なんにもリスクヘッジにならない。

XLMのほうが時価総額が低いのと、IBMとか色々要因があるので、どこかのタイミングで連動性落ちるとは思いますけど、ね。

あと、連動してるとはいっても波にズレがあるので、チャート見て入りやすい方に入るという使い方はできますね。
4538 2018-01-03 19:09:48 Invest in crypto currency 
4539 2018-01-03 19:09:47 I've noticed that every time I sleep crypto tends to make me money.

To test this theory I just took a nap.

Woke up to $ETH above $900. Not bad!
4540 2018-01-03 19:09:45 @eToro will we ever see anymore crypto trading platforms opening up? Such as XRB / ICX ?

4544 2018-01-03 19:09:23 The FUD comments are funny! Most of them don't even know how crypto and market prices work xD
4545 2018-01-03 19:09:21 Paid courses in stock options trading is a very common thing. A similar thing for crypto would be a reasonable investment for people with no experience.

4558 2018-01-03 19:08:24 Dear #GGP holders. When news comes through and we multi bag. Give consideration to where you're going to store your hard earned. Crypto? Potentially albeit risky, #Gold? Secure but slow. #FFWD booming and now in it's infancy so far as growth is concerned.  It's a buy and hold.
4559 2018-01-03 19:08:24 It was even 70USD according to coinmarket cap.. There is a telegram group of pumpers. Volume makes price to sky rocket, and they sell
4560 2018-01-03 19:08:24 If they can't then they over bought and put too much on the line....

4575 2018-01-03 19:07:16 Friends of mine are actually interested in crypto now. How things change. FOMO taking effect.
4576 2018-01-03 19:07:15 In a sense, crypto scams are good, without regs the space is rapidly iterating & experimenting with every bad idea known to man.

Furthermore, the stupid people that scam/get scammed get removed from the crypto gene pool by the community, while smart people survive & get smarter.
4577 2018-01-03 19:07:14 That is not the official Tron twitter and their news are fake about coinburn.
4578 2018-01-03 19:07:13 Which crypto were you going to buy?

What are you going to do with your physical gold?  I'd be curious if you could resell it today if you wanted to (not that you do) and what kind of hit it would take to resell it.

4580 2018-01-03 19:07:06 Dans l'idée, la Principauté souhaite développer la Crypto. Contrairement à d'autres, elle n'est pas hostile, et souhaite anticiper les changements.

4620 2018-01-03 19:05:06 But think about how much value these crypto's are actually providing? Think about how much money has been put into them.

btw, this isn't a dooms day post. We'll see the bubble pop coming imo. But in my eyes, it's Cleary a huge bubble, not for $BTC but for $alts.

If your SL gets hit very often:
1. your entry was too high.
2. your SL is too tight <15%.
Remember, the broker knows your SL and might take it before the price goes up.

4638 2018-01-03 19:03:16 I own plenty of crypto.  It's the greatest thing ever. Been in this for a long time. Im trying to make sure the wealth transfer goes into our hands, not back into the central banks we're trying to escape from. Ripple is the opposite of why crypto exists.
4639 2018-01-03 19:03:11 Just look at who I'm following, it's all people in crypto that I either know, respect, have interest in learning from, etc

4642 2018-01-03 19:02:56 Saying "nice agreeable" things on Crypto Twitter is worse than a waste of time because you're not only adding no value you're attention whoring. 

Saying unpopular things that you think are true on Crypto Twitter is the only way to add value to the discussion.
4643 2018-01-03 19:02:51 Why is that? Enlighten me please. I don't know much about this crypto.
4644 2018-01-03 19:02:50 Maybe if the official twitter would actually properly address shit like this then there would be no confusion. Leadership is cancerous in everything but coding.
4645 2018-01-03 19:02:48 Explain them that #Ripple is not a crypto, it's a company. It's not decentralized, it can be censored at will by government.

4654 2018-01-03 19:02:12 It took sometime for me to figure out the world of crypto, get an account opened and finally trade! 
4655 2018-01-03 19:02:11 with verge definitely but i respect ur loyalty

4658 2018-01-03 19:02:05 4 things to keep in mind to become successful in crypto.

1. Don't FOMO
2. Never panic sell
3. Tops are higher than you think
4. Lows are lower than you think
4659 2018-01-03 19:02:05 PS. Your twitter says "10 Year Crypto Investment Expert". Please explain to me how do you have 10 years of CryptoInvestment experience when Bitcoin is only 9 years old?  Just wondering.

4672 2018-01-03 19:01:30 According to COLX’s timeline they are doing the coin burn first which they said will be done by the end of this week. But then I think it could take another 2 or 3 weeks before it gets listed on Cryptopia. But hopefully sooner!

4692 2018-01-03 19:00:31 No market is PREDICTABLE because of the psychological factor. There are educated PREDICTIONS but they are far from "predictable." Even without charts you can predict the run up and dump out by XVG. Because it's man made and you can see it by simply looking at their books or past.
4693 2018-01-03 19:00:30 Getting paid in CRYPTO. Welcome to the future 
4694 2018-01-03 19:00:27 XRP/USD does not trade on Binance. Can you buy XRP/BTC which is offered even though you sold LTC "USD". I sold ETH/USD and tried to buy OMG/BTC on Binance and could not.

4739 2018-01-03 18:57:50 Both XMR & ZEC will do the job well enough. 
Both will be treated equally to sponsoring terrorism.

BTC won't have privacy features anytime soon - it'd trigger strict regulations against crypto, which we're not ready for. 
The regulations against anonymous coins will come sooner.

4764 2018-01-03 18:55:57 We never said xrp represent shares so let's take that off the table. The value of any crypto is a function of supply and demand. Ripple engaging in actions that increase the demand of XRP (use as a settlement tool) also increase the price. Have you read any of the Ripple papers?

4785 2018-01-03 18:55:08 If you’re not currently investing in crypto assets you’re missing the boat. Or should i say missing the rocket ship! 
4786 2018-01-03 18:55:07 It’s going to be an interesting year for the banks as the crypto (whole market) market cap passed 700 billion today.
4787 2018-01-03 18:55:06 Crypto itself may not be a bubble, but no question some of the coins are bubbles.
4788 2018-01-03 18:55:04 crypto isnt the future. its literally just an investment opportunity, get that through your skull

4794 2018-01-03 18:54:53 Can you all explain a bit? Just trying to understand what you're seeing and the implication. Don't have much invested anyway, but curious all the same.
4795 2018-01-03 18:54:52 I'm new to this crypto stuff. Is this something to hold onto for a while?
4796 2018-01-03 18:54:47 Part of my #crypto includes #ETN, this was bought in the #ICO and has sat between 400-700% profit ever since. It's been sat at a stable price for a while now, people might want to look into it before they start releasing updates

4797 2018-01-03 18:54:41 And to think that this smooth-tongued crypto-Muslim is still the man most admired by Americans! Grow up Americans. Trump for some reasons may not have your approval, but give him credit for being straight and upfront. He may end up doing you and America a lot of good.
4798 2018-01-03 18:54:41 If you want to buy with fiat you need to verify your account. If you want to buy with crypto, then you can buy with btc, eth and dash.

4800 2018-01-03 18:54:39 @RevolutApp any idea when crypto goes non premium?
4801 2018-01-03 18:54:37 I got in relatively late at 9k but thanks for shilling it so hard Ed this shit gonna go apeshit this year
4802 2018-01-03 18:54:34 Thanks for bringing such a great news ! Thanks
4803 2018-01-03 18:54:34 #XRP think of it this way, crypto investors:  the banks have the capital and political influence to bend markets and regulation to their favour.  Yes, it's evil, but do you think 2% of the elites controlling 98% of the wealth came about by mere chance?  #XRP is a safe bet.

4806 2018-01-03 18:54:24 RaiBlocks rebranding rumors to Nano. Any previous experience with rebranding? I still love the team just not sure how the transition is gonna be.
4807 2018-01-03 18:54:21 The #Monero ecosystem is sticky. Capital that flows in, tends to stay in the private/fungible world.

We will see strong positive feedback between merchant adoption, capital inflow and stickiness. 

Monero is the roach motel of crypto currency.

4809 2018-01-03 18:54:17 It’s bit hard to understand and buy altcoins from exchanges for newbees. This could be potential reason adding #ripple to coinbase can skyrocket its price. #Crypto

4812 2018-01-03 18:54:11 Why does it seem like market cap is so important to some people in Crypto? Billions of shares at low prices create big market caps. Shares are already being diluted because, so many are being used. Long term prices will suffer from the dilution. There are short term trades though

4821 2018-01-03 18:53:43 This point is valid, but doesn’t it also just shit on any low-to-mid cap coins by saying only the current “top” coins are “legit”? 2016 Top 10 vs 2017 Top 10 would tell us otherwise
4822 2018-01-03 18:53:42 A little confused.  Lots of #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency info and opinions being put out by people with less than 100 tweets and fewer than 100 followers? Kind of weird...guess everyone's an expert on crypto now.

4830 2018-01-03 18:52:45 It's my understanding that this is due to the fact that the crypto market caps represent all of the value of each form of digital currency in circulation.  The market caps do not represent the valuations of each crypto as if they were companies.  See the difference?
4831 2018-01-03 18:52:43 almost every crypto "trader" is in dreams of lambo... show me XVG team member which is attached on lambos... just DYOR and find some info about Sunerok, listen few interviews and than hope you understand something
4832 2018-01-03 18:52:41 every crypto-crypto trade is a cash out first, buying another crypto second, from taxmans point of view.

4848 2018-01-03 18:51:43 Using a bank account also fixes all these things but it loses everything that makes crypto amazing. Ripple is even run by the banks. Ripple is the banks acting like a parent who just doesn't  get it. Banks : "We have block chain are we cool yet?"

4893 2018-01-03 18:48:41 You sold XVG at a low to get into ripple at a high. Yeah you just told me everything you know about crypto which is nothing lol.
4894 2018-01-03 18:48:38 Do you see it breaking upwards anytime soon?
4895 2018-01-03 18:48:37 Well they need too give back what is missing or the will get no support from "leaders". They will also be completely untrustworthy of any investment. You don't just continue on with the platform without giving back money that was stolen. Don't matter if it's 5 coins or 5000 coins

You should invest because you believe in the tech. 
Read about $XVG, its potential, what it can do. 
Talk about it with your family, friends and colueges.

4940 2018-01-03 18:45:06 I ain’t young. But understand positive money flow when I see it.  Notice the money that used to be in Bitcoin is broadening out through the crypto world?  Picking winners vs losers should become more important.
4941 2018-01-03 18:45:03 Ever noticed that all Bitcoin FUDders are older than 65 years? Exactly!
4942 2018-01-03 18:44:57 #xvgwhale im not sure but i think he is not a real player just to make fast money! So if verge drops under 0,10 then i will post here a sell of 12,500,000 #Vergecurrency i dont give a damn and will post it here im in since 0,00

4951 2018-01-03 18:44:30 But that does not affect coins, we keep at @TradeSatoshi , is that correct?
4952 2018-01-03 18:44:26 not if it's one and he needs to trade at least 0.005 BTC ;-)
4953 2018-01-03 18:44:25 Cautionary tale.

There are many new crypto millionaires who have never had this kind of "wealth" before.

However, this type of wealth is kin to equity-rich cash poor...

You might have a 5 million crypto net worth.

But at the moment you don't have any buying power.

From our point of view a bridge between crypto & small businesses are interesting because it takes a good part of political interferences a side of the economic equation, while offering
4990 2018-01-03 18:42:28 Yes, bitcoin is decentralized, it's the most traded asset, it's on ALL exchanges, it doesn't have a leader, it's already on future markets (unlike any other crypto), in my experience I'm yet to see a centralized protocol that succeeds over a decentralized and open source one.
4991 2018-01-03 18:42:23 its not about coins, its just about FUD, hate and fake news... one of the is Haejin predicted that verge will be 1, 3 and 5$ in 2017... bullshit, as everything else that she said

4995 2018-01-03 18:42:10 So I’m still a crypto noob, but when I first started researching/reading about crypto, there was a very strong message of decentralisation taking the power away from financial institutions. Has the ‘fight’ already been lost?

5002 2018-01-03 18:41:52 They could do that. Why not?
I have strong doubts that they'll add $ZCL.

5080 2018-01-03 18:36:47 I'm sure it will be sorted. $PASC devs are savvy and ingenious guys. The coin is something totally new, this is also why it takes time to settle in the crypto ecosystem. It's getting noticed already,exchanges and huge waves will come sooner or later. The tech is going to prevail.

5091 2018-01-03 18:36:07 このサイトは去年の夏ぐらいから全てのリップルの記事の最後に「2017年末1ドル予想」を記載していて、12月になってもきつそうだったときは「2018年末2ドル予想」を記載していたんだけど、12月末に2ドル超えして予想が過去のものになってたんだ。

5096 2018-01-03 18:35:46 That's trivial Proof of Work, it's like pointing out that you have to pay electricity to log onto a website--sure you'd use less electricity not logging onto the site, but it's insignificant and you'd sound ridiculous trying to argue it was a paysite.

5105 2018-01-03 18:34:45 $BCH under-performs relative to wave of $ flooding crypto for tech & mkt reasons...find them instead of feeding other's delusions. Proof? Still-in-diapers $ADA, $XLM approaching $BCH's MktCap. $BTC pre-release whitepaper == genius proposal, was never a proven path to e-cash.

5132 2018-01-03 18:33:34 Awesome insights and write-up! Although the "crypto" world criticizes #XRP for being decentralized, @Ripple shows them real world use-cases instead of castles in the sky. Hodl is the magic word in this volatile world, and XRP will be #1 soon in the CMC.

If your are here for the long run there will be obstacles, it's your choice if you will fall over them or not ;) #verge #wraith
5223 2018-01-03 18:28:58 I am a sap, but idk just kinda defeats the purpose crypto was created in the first place so I couldn't support it. Happy for all of people I know that made money though, I hope everyone sees the moon at some point !
5224 2018-01-03 18:28:53 Half the coin supply. Better team. Decentralized. Ripple is not. Ran by banks pretty much. They are looking to control the crypto market with ripple. If it’s not obvious by now lol

5228 2018-01-03 18:28:44 Whenever the crypto shake up happens it’s gonna be huge
5229 2018-01-03 18:28:44 Can't agree at this one with you. I love Crypto. Gets me excited finding new gems, dumping on FOMOBitches and shitposting on Twitter. Overall sounds pretty fun to me?
5230 2018-01-03 18:28:42 Ripple went from a 10 billion market cap on December 1st to 120 billion today. Total crypto market cap is already up 100 billion since Dec. 31st, so there is no reason #bts can't be half way to $330 by Dec. 2018. When it hits where ripple is today, we are looking at $46/bts
5231 2018-01-03 18:28:42 Unlikely to see $MANA (Decentraland) under 1000 sats now I would think, seems to have found support here at 1000-1100

5235 2018-01-03 18:28:23 Spent week inside Crypto Twitter. Everyone is an expert, no one ever loses, and everyone argues over who touted something first. Like I never left Fantasy Twitter.
5236 2018-01-03 18:28:20 I think it's fake news Rand. There is no confirmation on official account about coin burn.
5237 2018-01-03 18:28:18 2/ The man behind the ICO boom? naval may be more famous for his Silicon Valley success, but he’s every bit the crypto innovator
5238 2018-01-03 18:28:18 Hey hey now lol I would admit It if I am wrong 
but thank you sir to me your insights on crypto are very valuable and I really truly do respect you.
5239 2018-01-03 18:28:18 Lmao. Crypto has made someone go wild.........
5240 2018-01-03 18:28:09 For me that would represent a step back for the crypto-descentralization-world: a semicentralized private token created for transfers between centralized institutions from the old system.
5241 2018-01-03 18:28:03 Crypto market is shaking

5243 2018-01-03 18:27:57 @Ripple will never take #1 spot on the crypto market caps, #XRP will.
5244 2018-01-03 18:27:54 I’m pretty confident most of your favorite DJ’s have spent more time trading crypto than making music so far in 2018.
5245 2018-01-03 18:27:53 Does the amount of time a crypto spends consolidating at a given rate mean anything for its eventual down or up trend?
5246 2018-01-03 18:27:50 Wtf!! So many losers in this world
5247 2018-01-03 18:27:49 If I keep up what I'm doing in the crypto space I'm officially making more money than I do at my job...
5248 2018-01-03 18:27:48 Jezz this people act like vultures. BTW congrats for this amazing initiative @crypto_rand. We have to many scammers doing giveaway out there, it's beautiful to see a real one happening.

5252 2018-01-03 18:27:14 there was that fucking mobile AR shooter that is already dreaming of a cs go style gun market and just offered its crypto micro transaction currency ahead of release for investors and raised millions. for a phone shooter
5253 2018-01-03 18:27:13 Le Stellar a 1 dollar dans les mois qui viennent pourquoi pas, tous est possible dans les crypto, j’aurais jamais imaginer le litecoin à 200$ quand il ete a 20$ j’avais l’impression d’être grave en retard
5254 2018-01-03 18:27:10 im still new to crypto, not sure my decisions are the best. You should make research and invest in the ones you believe in. Try to diversify
5255 2018-01-03 18:27:09 I admit I got shaken out of my bags yesterday. Sucks that it's pumping again, but at least I can go back on hating it again.
5256 2018-01-03 18:27:09 Sound advice 
5257 2018-01-03 18:27:08 Actually there’s more than one there making out they are him. Geeez.
5258 2018-01-03 18:27:07 New crypto called Beancoin releasing Friday, robust open-source blockchain based around virtual stuffed animals.  Buy some for your kids, better than government bonds.
5259 2018-01-03 18:27:06 Noticed that too. Lots of bots and scripts running. Project still has some horse power behind it
5260 2018-01-03 18:27:06 Yes, we went to kindergarten together
5261 2018-01-03 18:26:56 This is very accurate explanation of current crypto MC situation
5262 2018-01-03 18:26:50 ぶうううすと！！！
ICOに全降りや！！！！！！！！
IYIZFY!
5263 2018-01-03 18:26:49 What he said.  If you are trading crypto in 2018 you need to THINK like the noobs on coinbase.  Back maybe 18 months ago 90% of people in crypto were tekkie - now 90% can't even spell blokchayne.
5264 2018-01-03 18:26:48 Are hot dogs a new type of crypto
5265 2018-01-03 18:26:46 #blockchain Want to send a crypto or fiat to your friends directly from the messenger, then #eChat is what you need. #TokenSale #eChatICO
5266 2018-01-03 18:26:45 2 Options:
-Hardware wallet like the Ledger @Crypto_goat_ recommended. I have one & have it linked with MyEtherWallet.

-Downloadable wallets - Things like Exodus etc etc. They don't have every coin but a fair few. I use MEW for ERC20 tokens!
5267 2018-01-03 18:26:42 Man, that's sad.
5268 2018-01-03 18:26:37 Isn't Coinbase supposed to be against central entities? XRP is no exception. Coinbase listing XRP is pure speculation to pump this coin.
5269 2018-01-03 18:26:35 Yes very good project, and for sure x6. But maybe takes some time. Crypto is risky so i like the fast ones
5270 2018-01-03 18:26:34 とりあえずkucoinの次はokex
5271 2018-01-03 18:26:34 That's terrible.
5272 2018-01-03 18:26:32 Expanse... Think it could have massive gains for 2018
5273 2018-01-03 18:26:32 no word to describe them , pathetic is the least thing we can say
5274 2018-01-03 18:26:29 Hopefully you messaged the winner first then announced?
5275 2018-01-03 18:26:25 I have like 40% of the coins @CryptoMessiah picks. But usually because I came to the same conclusion. Bama fans and Auburn fans can agree on crypto apparently.
5276 2018-01-03 18:26:15 Scum!
5277 2018-01-03 18:26:15 @LuxCrypto would you ever think of setting up a separate YT for crypto? Or the bombardment from fans be too much you think?
5278 2018-01-03 18:26:14 #POWRtoken #POWERLEDGER I’m watching you very closely
5279 2018-01-03 18:26:05 A Centralised Cryptocurrency?
No thanks lol 

Decentralised crypto with the ability to be totally anonymous? Hell Yes!

5286 2018-01-03 18:25:57 You can't even get in at this  level with most crypto, they come to market at 1 sat or close to it. This is pre Ico. 10 lats, then the coin swap tomorrow. This is why their original page said they'd be one of the highest Pos coins.

5313 2018-01-03 18:24:47 Before anyone grills me about crypto I have them watch Banking On Bitcoin. Gives them the basics with most of the major events.
5314 2018-01-03 18:24:45 I think this happens by March
5315 2018-01-03 18:24:45 Pathetic!
5316 2018-01-03 18:24:42 Would be better if coindesk would investigate things that really matters to crypto, to avoid bubbles, protecting investors from making bad moves - NOT to cause a bubble on one side by taking out investors based on misunderstandings of the market and wrong sources. Just my 2 cents

5346 2018-01-03 18:22:59 Also related to the fast appreciation of crypto currencies, right? An ICO raising $36M today would have only raised $36k a year ago.
5347 2018-01-03 18:22:58 @GOGPodcast I did listen to the stocks section. I also want to know where you bought 60 bucks in crypto, coinbase you have to .001 of the market value.

5364 2018-01-03 18:22:05 Even better deal considering Litecoin has gone up quite a bit since this post. P.s I don’t currently own ANY crypto coin but want to dip in to it.

5366 2018-01-03 18:21:58 Homelessness and poverty are there because govt wants it, more directly the wealthy want it
The govt deliberately keeps people unemployed via the NAIRU policy
The govt creates dollars that could be used to fund what people need just like all of these crypto currencies are created
5367 2018-01-03 18:21:54 So in crypto you want to find the store of value. Basically the most stable priced high volume coin. That’s your hodl for other alts. Takes more patience than equities I’ve noticed.

5381 2018-01-03 18:21:17 Sure.I already pointed that out in my previous reply. We understand there is a problem (and the devs would have too) and we learn from these mistakes. None of this makes #xvg any less of a revolutionary privacy coin in the crypto space right now!

5397 2018-01-03 18:20:03 Incorrect, they buy more and start pumping the price while setting fake walls to accumulate/dump. Just because 5 wallets own most of the supply doesn't mean they can't P&D, in fact, it means the opposite. It's even easier.

5408 2018-01-03 18:19:28 Look, I think BTC out of all cryptos is special but thinking it's the only one - the one crypto to rule them all - is a fools game, and very naive. ETH, XRP are doing a great job and attending specific needs and mostly, gaps that BTC doesn't yet (but one day will) offer.

5410 2018-01-03 18:19:27 It will never reach #Bitcoin's current price due the amount of #XRP coins in circulation. An ambitious (but more realistic target) would be $100 by 2019. Probably somewhere between $20-$50 though. #cryptocurrency #BTC

5425 2018-01-03 18:18:31 Crypto currency is the perfect base for a parallel economy. You're seeing this in Venezuela already. Is it, by definition, something that governments will have to fight. You only pay taxes on crypto gains if you convert them into fiat. What happens when you don't have to convert?
5426 2018-01-03 18:18:31 Just shows you how much the crypto space has changed, people now jumping on this centralized garbage - be careful what you wish for...
5427 2018-01-03 18:18:22 Banks are the future of crypto.  And XRP will be their tool!!!  Plain and simple.

5442 2018-01-03 18:17:37 「BTCの非中央集権」が魅力的なストーリーになったのと同じく、
「XRPが時価総額1位になる」のは特殊な意味を持ったストーリーになりますね。
5443 2018-01-03 18:17:36 One could argue that 2 is preferable when considering the time value of money, especially in the current crypto space where hundreds of billions will be entering the space in the next year.
5444 2018-01-03 18:17:32 Much of what I’m seeing from the new wave of crypto adopters indicates they are low information investors.

5449 2018-01-03 18:17:02 If the 5 wallets own most of the coins, then it would not be a pump and dump.  That would mean that the 5 largest wallets have dumped all their coins spread throughout investors.  Also, those large wallets are probably exchange wallets.

5462 2018-01-03 18:16:21 Even though #xrp #ripple is at $3, that’s it’s average price. XRP/USD on most sites is at $2.70-2.78.

5466 2018-01-03 18:16:10 Other then "fan boi" answers., has anyone ever stop to ask why a bank would ever use Ripple? Maybe the greedy side that drives people to buy XRP should do some research on how banks do what they do. You would realize that they will do there own thing and protect there own a$$es.

5470 2018-01-03 18:15:58 I find it’s from a privileged position of snobbery that BTC early adopters speak about Ripple and other crypto’s. Their precious about it because it’s made them money. Fine. But it’s like, let’s lock the door behind us now, nothing else is good.

5473 2018-01-03 18:15:54 A crypto currency meant to circumvent the traditional banks and financial systems to make it easy and less expensive to move currency over the internet.  A world currency that is encrypted and linked by individual PCs which is much tougher to trace or steal.
5474 2018-01-03 18:15:50 I agree. And after that even more. I said it before: $lmc is bringing $crypto to the masses with their app. Hold tight.

5495 2018-01-03 18:14:13 Buying a majority of a commodity is risky or a business. This is buying an entity. Theoretically he’d be buying the rights to print 50% of the unaccounted for currency. The value is the conversional agility of a crypto currency
5496 2018-01-03 18:14:09 $XLM and $ADA are really good crypto currencies to invest in they both have nearly doubled in value since I’ve bought in. Highly recommend you wait for a dip to buy in or buy in right now while it’s still fairly cheap!
5497 2018-01-03 18:14:09 Classic criminal manipulation. Shit project with tech that doesn't do what it claims to do. They have been P&Ding this... it's the same pump group as RDD and the leadership is a part of it. Look who owns all of the XVG... 5 wallets have most of the circulating $XVG
5498 2018-01-03 18:14:08 That's the right spirit. Most of the investors vision was based on a short term and forgot the actual reason why they invested in XVG. XVG is a lot more than numbers, it's the tech that will make us shine. #verge #crypto #vergecurrency #WraithProtocol

5505 2018-01-03 18:13:41 What is stopping them (central banks) launching there own cryptos and learning from all the mistakes of the other crypto currencies. Is there really a first mover advantage in this game? Are the barriers to entry as high as you guys think?

5520 2018-01-03 18:12:39 #RippleNet have been used with other currencies like Euro but as of now with crypto they are being tested but soon will run in Production... Banks like AMEX, AXIS have partnered with #XRP
5521 2018-01-03 18:12:38 Woke up to #XRP AT all time highs - again. Pretty, pretty good.  #xrpthestandard #cryptocurrency #Crypto #ripple
5522 2018-01-03 18:12:34 WHICH CRYPTO HAS THE MOST POTENTIAL?? #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum #litecoin #ripple #xrp #iota #vergecoin #nagacoin #hitbtc #coinbase #bitfinex #bittrex #gdax #coindesk #coingecko #cointelegraph $btc $ltc $eth $xrp $xrb $dash $ada cardano $trx $rhoc $xp

5526 2018-01-03 18:12:26 Contemplating investing a large sum of cash into crypto currency...like sucks if it fails but if it picks up?? Hello future? 
5527 2018-01-03 18:12:26 It does work due to the fact that crypto is still a simple market dominated by emotions.
5528 2018-01-03 18:12:21 Foundamentally and tecnically
5529 2018-01-03 18:12:21 Congratz

5531 2018-01-03 18:12:11 Congratz!
5532 2018-01-03 18:12:10 Congratz !
5533 2018-01-03 18:12:08 They had to keep track if the crypto key. No way a company like that would of just lost it....but if they did whoa what a mistake
5534 2018-01-03 18:12:07 It's good to learn a new crypto skill.

5592 2018-01-03 18:09:04 Crypto is not so diverse right now, and that's ok.
If you're an early adopter, you've probably enjoyed some privileges in your life, and that's ok.
Diversity is coming to crypto in a big way, and that's ok.
People will take all the time they need to come aboard, and that's ok.
5593 2018-01-03 18:09:00 Who out there has some bit coin and wants to make other investments for a crypto currency currently on the rise and will be big soon.

5594 2018-01-03 18:08:54 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。
5595 2018-01-03 18:08:49 thank god for crypto currencies 
5596 2018-01-03 18:08:49 Crypto currency charts are funner to watch. Especially on a sick day

5605 2018-01-03 18:08:08 The "Mayer Multiple" is a great novel crypto technical indicator.

But the "Dogecoin Correlation" indicator is even better. The closer your crypto's movements are correlated with Dogecoins, the more of a shitcoin it is.
5606 2018-01-03 18:08:02 A long-term invested of multiple crypto currency, it’s exciting to see my investments are on the rise. Keep on! Keep on!

5629 2018-01-03 18:06:11 Regardless of if he is paid or not he was the only mouthpiece for XVG during their period of uncertainty and is a total ass clown. I pulled out at .20 because of him and it seems like a lot of other people are over the drama with that coin when there are so many other options.

5659 2018-01-03 18:04:10 This is where my knowledge about crypto is weak. (Just shows me where to research next) I know the fees are high percentage wise for BTC, but to make 167 USD unspendable... And I'm on a different platform. Which goes to show it's universal and based on high traffic.
5660 2018-01-03 18:04:09 Thought the same. Have a nap, wake up, everything‘s normal again
5661 2018-01-03 18:04:01 To some degree you can't blame people for chasing pumps, but it's litterally a bet AGAINST crypto....

5663 2018-01-03 18:03:55 Banks are capitalists, it's very simple. They want a better product that saves them more $$ - Ripple tech combined with $XRP provides them with this solution. Faster, cheaper, more transparent. Simple.
5664 2018-01-03 18:03:51 What happened to your trx  chart?
5665 2018-01-03 18:03:42 $DENTACOIN please
5666 2018-01-03 18:03:35 Not one for crypto currency but #oilcoin sounds like a gem tbh
5667 2018-01-03 18:03:34 Of course people are jumping on board.  Have you seen the current state of anytown usa lately?  People are struggling just to pay rent and buy food.  Crypto looks to may like a way they can get in on the action for a relatively small investment.  It's a opportunity for people.
5668 2018-01-03 18:03:24 I'm not sure if Coinbase are withholding the transactions until the gas price is lower but the gas price is higher than usual at the moment.
5669 2018-01-03 18:03:23 Not to mention the drama surrounding @officialmcafee dumping #xvg right before the planned wraith release, which inturn got delayed due to technical issues even though @justinvendetta and team worked their ass of!

5674 2018-01-03 18:03:05 If not to late I would like to get a copy of your crypto tracking sheet.
5675 2018-01-03 18:03:05 Why would you call my account fake? I invested in Verge because I believe in it. And I will keep posting honest information about Verge here.
5676 2018-01-03 18:03:04 sitting here watching $XRP satoshi's rise is a warming feeling. but knowing i shorted 3000 coins after a 5x profit, and seeing it wouldve been a 10x if i waited a week, is a crushing feeling. live and learn in the crypto world
5677 2018-01-03 18:03:00 Made a me too buy of my first crypto in TRX.  Was more about trying to understand the process.  It is definitely a whole new world out there.

5681 2018-01-03 18:02:40 Many exchanges today cap fiat withdrawals. So you essentially end up with a pile of money on the exchange with nowhere to go but back into crypto.
5682 2018-01-03 18:02:37 Ripple is a fake crypto. Wouldn’t sell my worst enemy’s soul for it.
5683 2018-01-03 18:02:25 Ahh thanks for the info! Good to know it’s not one of the exchanges, I trust the blockchain to sort itself out far more than those guys!

5704 2018-01-03 18:00:49 Oh, that's a long answer. In short,
1) Bad publicity and PR - Inflated expectations
2) People assuming to become overnight millionaire on the 31st
3) Devs not communicating to the community about Wraith updates
4) Weaklinks selling the shit right now (and will regret later)

5757 2018-01-03 17:58:30 The fud is part of a coordinated campaign, I'm sure it's costing someone a lot of money to organize and execute. We need to organize better ourselves, to combat this.
5758 2018-01-03 17:58:29 The more I think about it the more I am certain. Crypto currencies will be the way forward, and it's going to hyperinflate our fiat. So not only will we see upsides on the coin markets but money itself will lose its buying power in tandem.

Last year's 19% rally in the S&P 500 was touted as a great year. It's not even one day's return in the world's hottest crypto-thingy.

5821 2018-01-03 17:55:32 Most of the Crypto exchanges are killing it. I have been tracking XRP since it was 1.9 USD. It has risen 30% since then but exchanges are going to pocket 27% in commissions. This whole thing appears to be a giant Ponzi at international level..
5822 2018-01-03 17:55:27 That's not how it will work. Once BC truly takes off and gets btter, we won't know the difference between FIAT and Crypto. Our currencies will be much better on so many areas. The centralised part is important, if you want a currency to have a positiv effect on a society.

5842 2018-01-03 17:54:28 Clearly your not
5843 2018-01-03 17:54:27 @krakenfx You seem to have misplaced a lot of my money. I show a successful deposit but the funds aren't available to trade with, and aren't on the ledger. This sort of thing does not help the credibility of crypto in general. Would this happen with stocks? #cryptocurrency

5850 2018-01-03 17:54:17 So my predictions, in a ten tweet thread: 1. Crypto/blockchain dies as a major story this year. the Silicon Valley hype cycle is a pretty predictable thing, and there’s simply too much real-but-boring work to be done right now in the space.

5874 2018-01-03 17:53:13 One of the non-fundamental reasons crypto will only grow is that it’s still confusing to trade. You have to use a US exchange like @coinbase to buy one of the top 5 coins. Then transfer to an off shore exchange like @binance_2017 to trade all coins. And money takes long to clear.
5875 2018-01-03 17:53:13 Good morning crypto twitter
5876 2018-01-03 17:53:11 Thank you @Haejin_Crypto
5877 2018-01-03 17:53:05 This is great news for all crypto currencies. It means that a major government is formally acknowledging crypto currencies. This could be big news.
5878 2018-01-03 17:53:05 None or I would have made a video on it for you cunts
5879 2018-01-03 17:53:01 @CryptoMessiah Hey Messiah, you mentioned on the podcast that you may weight in on a coin if it was politely asked.

I picked up a mini bag of UKG today. Do you have any thoughts on crypto in e-sports? Haven’t really heard anyone mention it.

Thanks man.

5893 2018-01-03 17:52:34 one of the most notable things to me abt rise of bitcoin/crypto is how adamantly people express their thoughts on something that nearly no one has any unique insight or information advantage on. far as I can tell, everyone's guessing & applying hindsight logic when they're right

5924 2018-01-03 17:50:49 Since the mcaffee pumps and the telegram calls it definitely got worse. A lot of people don't care for the technology anymore but want to make 600% gains in 5 minutes.

5961 2018-01-03 17:49:13 I'm not going to complain if #IOTA hits $250, for sure, but you're talking about a $700Bil market cap. I don't think the world will be ready to accept that kind of valuation by 2018.

5964 2018-01-03 17:49:05 Unfortunately, most ppl don’t know how to obtain XRP independently. You start out by 1st owning some other crypto. You can even buy w/XMR.
5965 2018-01-03 17:48:59 Crypto investors calling each other.. noobs?
5966 2018-01-03 17:48:58 なるほど…
どの期待に応えるか選択する、って大事ですね…覚えときます(´･ω･`)
5967 2018-01-03 17:48:51 Oh damn, despite the fact it advertises my portfolio in $  do you have any ideas which crypto you are going for? I have fingers in a few pies at the moment.
5968 2018-01-03 17:48:49 #ripple / $XRP is like the @DeBeers of crypto. Circulate only a small portion of the supply to inflate demand, convince millions that what they provide is actually worth something/ better than the obvious alternatives, and then laugh all the way to the bank.

5976 2018-01-03 17:48:13 I am not a snow flake, so no worries. I have my own convictions and you have yours. I like finding innovative technology and watch it transform how we live. Crypto in general suffices that desire.
5977 2018-01-03 17:48:11 What are you liking these days in the crypto space?
5978 2018-01-03 17:48:09 @CryptoKenobi @Crypto_goat_ looking to protect my investment, do you guys know of a secure offline wallet to use. Own all alt coins.

5980 2018-01-03 17:48:08 うーん、全部無視しなくていいけど、期待ってのは無限に膨らむし、勝手なものだから、誰のどの期待に応えるかは選択しなきゃいけないんじゃないかな？

人生限られてるし、ニーズなんて世界に無限に転がってるのに、全部の期待に応えてると死んじゃう。

どれにどこまで応えるかは自分で選ぶ、と。
5981 2018-01-03 17:48:05 Long term I would imagine Bitcoin will win. It's the only crypto curency that's censure proof, truly decentralized most secure
5982 2018-01-03 17:48:03 The younger you are, the more of your funds should be invested in the crypto space.
5983 2018-01-03 17:48:01 $XRP hits $3! Love it or hate it, the performance of #ripple is rather impressive. I bought #XRP when it was half this price, and it’s a hold for me. A lot of mainstream buzz around this coin, so this will prop it up. Wish I bought more. Will look for the dip.

6009 2018-01-03 17:45:48 Right. If banks are sending in emissaries to tout diversity in crypto, this should be the least surprising turn of events, and really just shows how few buttons they have to push.
6010 2018-01-03 17:45:41 Why bait someone who clearly has an issue with verge as it rivals monero? All you're doing is creating more negative attention when that's the last thing needed at this point.

6039 2018-01-03 17:42:42 Large concentrated investments mean you receive maximum impact and rewards. When It comes to crypto it's identifying the sub penny or at best 5p coins that your research tells you will bring maximum growth. $Alts $Crypto $BTC

6090 2018-01-03 17:39:05 To co mówi @kevinmesserly  to całkowicie prawda i wiem że mogę mu ufać.... nawet sam @Haejin_Crypto  zrobił analizę jak zostać milionerem....a sam wiesz że on się nie myli  Bitshares jest wielkie a jeszcze nie odpaliło żadnego silnika rakiety..
6091 2018-01-03 17:38:59 I’d trust bitUSD way more than I would ever trust tether. With so many risks in crypto why add to them by holding tether. Exchanges should give us the choice.
6092 2018-01-03 17:38:50 man, I wouldn't wish crypto on anyone. One of my kids picked it up from a water park and shared it. 10 years ago and I can still remember the smell.
6093 2018-01-03 17:38:46 add .09 on it, then sell the whole package
6094 2018-01-03 17:38:45 If the deposit and transfer of payment used #ripple all crypto #bitcoin #XRP would be higher right now, as investors would already have made thier purchase. @BTCNews247 @BTCMarkets
6095 2018-01-03 17:38:41 I’m mad af I ain’t catch da crypto wave while it was hot
6096 2018-01-03 17:38:40 This guy is low key roger ver's fuck buddy
6097 2018-01-03 17:38:36 remember that looking at the possible growth of a coin is far more important than how cheap it is. I see people buying crypto all day based just on that. for example $Dash is over 1k. you would have made more money owning a percentage of that than stacking up on a coin like $XVG
6098 2018-01-03 17:38:26 You misspelled the name of the coin. It's supposed to be ReddCoin. There's a coin named RedCoin which is now exploding, too. Coincidence? Probably not.
6099 2018-01-03 17:38:18 このサイト、少し前までは「2017年末1ドル,2018年末2ドル予想」だったのに
この最新記事では2018年末で10ドル予想にアップデートされてるw

6101 2018-01-03 17:38:00 yes, but that beast will take the highest damage when $BTC raises a bit. Yesterday it went down from 630 to 400 when btc raised a bit. IMO to risky to expect more gains, when btc is bullish. I sold everything between 600 and 550 (bought for 248).
6102 2018-01-03 17:38:00 HELP!! I may be a bit late, but Im gonna join the Crypto party. What is a good platform to join to trade?
6103 2018-01-03 17:37:57 Maar bro, heb jij ook betaald via ABN AMRO, en is ook de betaling gewoon goed gegaan, maar dat er niks gebeurt is. Want dat ligt dan toch niet aan ABN AMRO
6104 2018-01-03 17:37:56 そういう風に引き寄せられる、貪欲さと正直さがあるのが見てて楽しいなって個人的に思います。人間でいうと、「素直」って感じ。
6105 2018-01-03 17:37:56 so then the natural question is, how do you value crypto holdings? we say warren buffett is worth as much as his berkshire shares, even though they would likely be worth less if he sold them. not as much less as if larsen sold his xrp, but the same principle applies.
6106 2018-01-03 17:37:55 if ripple is crypto, then visa also crypto :D
6107 2018-01-03 17:37:45 sorry, some banks can take a little longer. Email us if urgent for help. Now, if only it was BTC or even better DASH 
6108 2018-01-03 17:37:29 I dont understand crypto mining, need to look into it. So you get free coins?
6109 2018-01-03 17:37:17 I agree Jessika. We are going to look back at these crypto stocks day as the golden age of trading. I love this scan and set ups it alerts me to.
6110 2018-01-03 17:37:14 I'm brand new to the crypto scene (jumped in just under two weeks ago) so still finding my feet. I appreciate any feedback and direction!
6111 2018-01-03 17:37:09 IMO prices will look extremely cheap once Japan starts buying.  Lots to look forward to on Litecoin in 2018 #HODL #LTC4TheWin $LTC
6112 2018-01-03 17:37:08 ソッレ。
6113 2018-01-03 17:37:07 Why not?  Look at how everything is moving.  I stopped being technical with crypto after seeing ripple move from about 5 cents to almost 3 bucks.

6146 2018-01-03 17:34:29 We'll have to see what happens, hopefully they push an update soon. At the moment 4.0 is essentially 3.0 with a different UI and stealth addresses. Stealth addresses aren't new and it's nothing for potential investors to get excited about.
6147 2018-01-03 17:34:24 Shamefully I bought in on the JM pump. It does look to have potential, particularly if it's integrated in Steam. If @Haejin_Crypto likes it then who am i to argue

6181 2018-01-03 17:31:52 I'm so glad @StellarOrg is doing well. I think the ethical nature of #XLM is what's important here. It Banks the unbanked. More people have accessed to a phone/laptop than the banking system. They want to plug the gap. Advisors include founders of Stripe and wordpress #crypto
6182 2018-01-03 17:31:52 but you only need to learn how to buy Bitcoin once and the afterwards can buy multiple times... so number of searches slowing down does not necessarily mean that price must go down.
6183 2018-01-03 17:31:48 We’re three days into 2018 and I’ve already doubled the value of my crypto portfolio.... I’ve said it several times already and I’ll keep saying it til people listen, if you aren’t investing in these coins right now you’re missing out on the financial opportunity of a lifetime
6184 2018-01-03 17:31:40 Yeah, truth... bla bla bla

6186 2018-01-03 17:31:34 I can't complain and really you should hop on board there is tons of room to grow. I would think 40 plus ico they have commin out would hardly make them what you cosinder failed unless you have some high expectations lol in that case what crypto are you into
6187 2018-01-03 17:31:31 Not at all! Until we hold more crypto than fiat, until we can pay for our coffee, mortgages and bills with crypto, there will still be a need to keep the banks around. What needs to happen is for the relationship between FI's and Crypto companies to become stronger.

6192 2018-01-03 17:31:14 Newbie lesson 6/6: When buyingbalt coins, $ETC transactions are usually faster than $BTC ones. Consider that and look at the trading pair options on your exchange before deciding which one coin you’re going for.

6200 2018-01-03 17:30:19 I guess you could consider them derivatives of BTS since these bitAssets are shorted into existence by traders on the DEX that use their BTS as collateral.

P.S. You create these bitAssets via an interest free loan to buy more crypto. You are your own bank.

Fear that the network has been hacked will drive Banks toward #Bitcoin and other decentralized solutions with enough liquidity.
6260 2018-01-03 17:25:22 But stocks and crypto are completely different things. Owning crypto only gives you crypto. Owning stock gives you rights enforceable by law.

6356 2018-01-03 17:17:52 Je weet dat ik nlder ben Haha. Ik zelf zit er al vroeg in, ik ga verkopen 20-25% van me positie om funds vrij te spelen. Vaak is het zo dat het goed gaat moonen en dan 20-40% weer terugdipt, maar dit is crypto je weet nooit. Ik persoonlijk zal wachten op de dip. Wees voorzichtig

6361 2018-01-03 17:17:45 I agree that it should be lowered though. Xrp must always be the leading crypto in terms of doing whats right. Always have to be one step ahead to assist its community

6391 2018-01-03 17:15:16 wouldn't be surprised if you did a 100 btc offer for it lol, people bought fucken crypto kitties for a 100k $$.
6392 2018-01-03 17:15:16 An even better way is to take the NEO and invest in their ICOs. For example, $DBC, I'm up x8 after a week, sold off the initial investment and let the rest run. Keep scalping that profit (it's bound to go up more than .15, $1 target) for more NEO then move to APEX and Elastos...

6407 2018-01-03 17:14:24 Stellar market cap over 15.000.000.000 must be a crypto joke. This is insane like Ripple. These are centralized "coins" with a manipulated low liquidity. The Ripple&Stellar/BTC ratio has pumped and dumped several times within the last years. Be careful.

6425 2018-01-03 17:13:12 20$ is not a lot. Mission driven companies/teams in crypto which provide real value in commercial use will lead the pack. Ripple with XRP is in commercial mode, it’s not a scientific experiment, which means it’s adding real value to the companies using it.

Patience is the most important thing to being a trader.  Sometimes you will be in a position for days or even longer, trying to trade every minute is a sure way to fail

6495 2018-01-03 17:08:10 No, of course they are.  Creating a crypto currency tournament in hopes of massive over booking seems like an unlikely route.  A fun tournament based on recent buzz seems more likely imo

6530 2018-01-03 17:05:21 That's the biggest problem right now...not much gains unless you are investing in a couple of grand. Crypto is seeing new people jumping on board every day. They'd rather see quick easy gains with these penny coins rather than this snail-like pace with #Litecoin currently.

6555 2018-01-03 17:03:51 $PIVX is a privacy-centric, proof-of-stake cryptocurrency forked from $DASH. It’s run by a global community of creators, innovators and tech-enthusiasts. This is still a very undervalued coin IMO. Don’t sleep on this one for 2018.

6559 2018-01-03 17:03:33 meh, ripple have clients and a working infrastructure that operates exactly as it was designed to. You may argue that its not a proper crypto-currency, but you cannot argue that it works or that it has clients.
6560 2018-01-03 17:03:29 kinda happy that we reach consensus ;) So, we agree on that could have done better technical work before releasing a coin but still hoping the best for the future bcs obviously fundamentals are great and thankful! cheers

6637 2018-01-03 16:58:51 @Bitstamp @Bitstamp @nejc_kodric  Hi Team, I hv opened couple of support tickets (SUPPORT-2531, SUPPORT-5441 & SUPPORT-11932) for my acct access issue but no response over the month !! Do U really care about Ur customers ? Is @Crypto_goat_ @CryptoBoomNews
6638 2018-01-03 16:58:48 Yeah, there is a lot of Internet marketers jumping on the crypto train trying to shill paid barebones courses. When in reality all the resources you need are freely available. When need to strive to spread awareness about these resources for newcomers.

6644 2018-01-03 16:58:06 A great time to accumulate #Gold because relative pricing as good as I've seen. Wealth preservation trade is off, nobody wants "boring" when there's a "Goldilocks" market, "you cant lose" in tech, crypto, housing, etc

Nobody goes poor taking (gold)money off the table in a bubble

6654 2018-01-03 16:57:30 Regarding stocks. Stocks created a new way of creating wealth/value. Stocks have done so much good for all of us.

Bitcoin brings the same dream of creating another channel of wealth. If not Bitcoin maybe some other crypto; but I wonder how much good it create with more abundance
6655 2018-01-03 16:57:22 $smart is that new THING for me at least. It's all about the communities in crypto and if I find a good one I try not to pass it up

6660 2018-01-03 16:57:10 @hmantrading
6661 2018-01-03 16:57:07 Only investing in crypto that’s mineable. Those tokens are owned by banks trying to buy Bitcoin for the low.

6663 2018-01-03 16:56:56 You know it's time to take a step back from #crypto when you fatfinger a bid on Bittrex.
6664 2018-01-03 16:56:45 this sounds like a great idea tbh. I'm inspired to do the same
6665 2018-01-03 16:56:43 Now hang on. You're @XVGWhale? And you have another account promoting NAV Coin?

How many more fake accounts do you have like this?

How many more crypto communities are you trying to scam?

And btw, what about the bet you made? Or someone took over your D*ck as well?
6666 2018-01-03 16:56:42 Noooo not crypto 
6667 2018-01-03 16:56:41 I HATE those bitconnect videos
6668 2018-01-03 16:56:32 Yeah I see some crazy shit to say the least. Best one yet was the dude that lost his passport and had to cross mine fields and get shot at to go get a new one. Americans have no clue about demand for crypto currency...
6669 2018-01-03 16:56:30 Many countries legalise Crypto Currency then why not in India.
6670 2018-01-03 16:56:28

6673 2018-01-03 16:56:27 The #cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy. We need more participation from investors, greater market integration, and clear guidance from #regulators.

6676 2018-01-03 16:55:46 Cardano just came out two months ago and is already the top 5 crypto. It is way overvalued. In your video please compare it NEO, ICON, and EOS.

6688 2018-01-03 16:55:09 Thinking about getting into this crypto currency stuff. Anyone out there willing to help?

6694 2018-01-03 16:54:23 The crypto world will be shaken by Bitcoin Private. Not buying $ZCL for the $BTCP fork will be top of regret lists at the end of 2018.
6695 2018-01-03 16:54:20 Hard to read in crypto lol
6696 2018-01-03 16:54:18 Sure, i often agree to disagree. There's no ultimate right or wrong and an individual opinion relies on a lot of factors. Personally, i think $XRP doesn't belong into the $crypto asset class. That doesn't mean there aren't valid use cases.
6697 2018-01-03 16:54:15 Sure, you’re right, my crypto line was very extreme. Equities/ETFs/Passive funds on the other hand ...
6698 2018-01-03 16:54:11 which crypto is the best to invest in today?
6699 2018-01-03 16:54:00 ベルタースなんちゃらオリジナルですか
6700 2018-01-03 16:53:59 I've always said that you must only invest that much in crypto currency that you can afford to lose.
It is possible that you may wake up someday with all your investment gone to zero.
So understand and then only invest.
6701 2018-01-03 16:53:58 But come on, #crypto is replacing fiat so doing a system that help move fiat is outdated from the start. Its like creating 60% cheaper carriage when cars are upcoming.. $xrp

6704 2018-01-03 16:53:36 @crypto_rand what do u Think about buy now siacoin and xlm?

6708 2018-01-03 16:53:21 Diversifying in the *traditional way* of managing a portfolio, only applies to when you have a decent amount of money. 200 bux split into 6 crypto's doesn't make sense if you end up paying half in transaction fees.
6709 2018-01-03 16:53:21 lol not in canada, add a couple hundred more bucks.
i wouldnt buy vega anyway except for maybe crypto if i could get it at the msrp.

but still would rather grab some 1060 6gigs for that

6725 2018-01-03 16:52:15 I would also contact @kucoincom about getting listed on Kucoin's exchange. It would be a great exchange for Excc to be listed at.
6726 2018-01-03 16:52:12 Agreed. Still if one believes their crypto holdings will likely go up a lot, value to transferring to DAF closer to maximal price rather than transferring prematurely. Will maximize tax deduction.

Based on the Etherium Kitty craze that saw virtual kittens sell for thousands of dollars, I am the proud new owner of two first edition Tron Crypto-puppies.

6729 2018-01-03 16:51:59 The keyword here is free. I'm noticing some online "entrepreneurs" that only started mentioning cryptocurrency about a month ago, trying to charge  people for courses on crypto. You know because they are experts all of the sudden!
6730 2018-01-03 16:51:53 @crypto_rand Your TA on BTC?
6731 2018-01-03 16:51:51 love the farley hahaha nice one
6732 2018-01-03 16:51:46 to all the sheep who are falling for this; they are doing whats called "front running" and then using "leveraged options" to dump.  This is illegal in a regulated market.  This tactic is as old as it gets and is legal to do in the crypto wild west.
6733 2018-01-03 16:51:36 Litecoin will have a huge marketing push in 2018
6734 2018-01-03 16:51:33 Jeez, I may need to invest into crypto currency. I just need to learn about it more. I’m old school, I’m Wall Street.
6735 2018-01-03 16:51:31 Just hodling bitcoin would have given me a 13.3x return for the year. Something like ripple or litecoin , major largecaps even greater return, I see statistically that a 100% return is best for expected value. However, trading crypto is far more complicated
6736 2018-01-03 16:51:26 Crypto putting me more and more on the fringe. The further you go down the rabbit hole the harder it becomes to go back.
6737 2018-01-03 16:51:25 Cryptocurrency market hits $700b market cap today! When will we hit $1 trillion? #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #litecoin $ptoy $ift $ltc $dent
6738 2018-01-03 16:51:20 I agree 100% Eric diversify if you got over $10k. For us smaller owner of Crypto best be going in it all on one. Says if you do a few. The long term gain is not as much as you expected cause you didn't have that investment with just the one coin.
6739 2018-01-03 16:51:20 Crypto market cap making the slow march to $1T - it will happen sooner than you think.
6740 2018-01-03 16:51:19 @crypto_bobby seems like a green day for all alts. Do you think it would be dangerous tomorrow?
6741 2018-01-03 16:51:12 @Jasmine just emailed you about a Crypto entrepreneur who's currently running his own ICO. Might be of interest. Thanks, Guy
6742 2018-01-03 16:51:08 @koinexindia Koinex had only INR withdrawal & deposit issue otherwise they are very much in Blockchain and crypto transactions are going very smoothly. It is my personal experience and that is today only. All remain assured.
6743 2018-01-03 16:51:06 no, not quite because of that, but because ripple is not a cryptocurrency but rather a scam piggybacking on crypto rush.
6744 2018-01-03 16:51:02 Do you even understand the circumstances the Indian exchanges are going through?
Banks stopped processing payment request from crypto currency exchanges (due to some govt. Pressure probably).
Just don't call it a scam without knowledge.
You will scare new investors.
6745 2018-01-03 16:50:54 Ayrıca yüksek hacim ve alım satıp rakamlarını binance hızlı yapamıyor galiba. Yani memnunuz binance den ama yüksek hacimli emirleri daha hızlı yapması lazım. Ne diyorsunuz bu konuda? Bugun de yarım saatlik bakım varmış
6746 2018-01-03 16:50:52 In the event of bull or bear run when investors want to liquidate crypto how will exchanges manage encashment. imagine total fiat invested in a exchange is 100mn and they get withdrawal request for 500mn. Are exchanges  or banks or govt prepared for that.

6755 2018-01-03 16:50:05 I'm confused.  Are you investing or trading?  I do not trade my crypto's ..I hold them... I sat on ripple for many many many months to get these returns.  You seem to think that if your positions aren't going up you need to get out of them... That's not how my strategy works
6756 2018-01-03 16:50:00 donate to me :)
6757 2018-01-03 16:49:50 XRP's parabolic trend is due to a wave of new people buying into crypto& the fact it was one of the "least expensive" in the top 5, and rumors of being added to coinbase.  Not due to its fast cheap transactions. There are a hundred other coins that do the same shit.#takeprofits
6758 2018-01-03 16:49:41 I always "Do Own Your Research". I also never sell at a loss even though I know the price is going down further.
6759 2018-01-03 16:49:33 The fear of crypto market for Indian economy is bit irrational, the rationale behaviour should be taken as a good taxation policy in support of it,

6764 2018-01-03 16:49:01 I don't see how you can add otc derivatives to money to be displaced by crypto, without also considering crypto derivatives as crypto too.
6765 2018-01-03 16:49:01 Or knowing that jeb has a huge amount of ripple to sell off and has a competing crypto like stellar to fall back on.
6766 2018-01-03 16:49:00 What was the price at the time you invested?

6769 2018-01-03 16:48:54 It has really got my attention today I have to say... Very interesting.
6770 2018-01-03 16:48:50 Would also be amazing if a DAF manager setup the ability to hold in crypto (Thereby introducing incredible volatility to the potential gift, but speaking to donors likely HODL desire).
6771 2018-01-03 16:48:42 Sick of all the greed and fear and hate/pump on xvg. If it serves a purpose it will become whatever it is worth as a good medium of transfer in the privacy area.    Crypto can grow as a result of greed, but it can also die as a result.
6772 2018-01-03 16:48:40 I started to make an up line crypto  joke, but Nioctib sounds more like a drug. Explains price action.
6773 2018-01-03 16:48:30 There's seems to be a movement to keep BTC's overall market cap in crypto under 40%, suggesting anything under that is the new normal for a stable environment. We'll see though.

But with shitty nonces~"

Fairly sure that's not technically correct, but eh.
6781 2018-01-03 16:47:47 HitBTCは送金詰まりと見せかけて、価格差利用して、自分達だけアビトラしてたりして。やれないことではないからなぁ。どちらにせよ、こんなことだとユーザーは減るだろうなぁ。
6782 2018-01-03 16:47:42 No it is not up...and with the volatility of the crypto currencies this is a massive issue! Missing opportunities, risk to find our account worth nothing. It cannot take so long to fix an issue in your industry and i highlight again in the fast moving volatile world of cryptos
6783 2018-01-03 16:47:41 الماركت كاب الحين فوق ٧١٤ مليار دولار و الريبل وصل ١١٣ مليار دولار unbelievable
6784 2018-01-03 16:47:35 Yeah, that's a decade in crypto-time....
6785 2018-01-03 16:47:30 haha...if market were crypto I'd agree. I'd sell premium on the call end for $SPY. 270 or under close for week. No bearish but have to consolidate gains. Volume is low end and no catalyst for push over resistance so easily. GL buddy

6789 2018-01-03 16:47:20 In such an environment, does it really matter that settlement, clearing, margin risks in crypto might be worse?

6793 2018-01-03 16:47:02 @koinexindia 
In the event of bull or bear run when investors want to liquidate crypto how will you manage encashment. imagine total fiat invested in Koinex is 100mn and you get withdrawal request for 500mn. Are you or govt prepared for that.

6809 2018-01-03 16:46:09 It's quite disappointing to see #Litecoin continue to drop in the crypto rankings while all these smaller coins are getting pumped. I would no be surprised if we saw the ranking of LTC continue to fall while buyers are seeking cheaper alternatives for quicker gains.
6810 2018-01-03 16:46:00 U mean mama can go higher than now?
6811 2018-01-03 16:45:53 The money is nice but the tech behind all these coins that is going to change the world is the amazing part.  2018 is going to be such an awesome year for crypto and we are all blessed to be a part of it.  #cryptocurrency #crypto #bitcoin #btc #altcoins

6814 2018-01-03 16:45:45 It's a very popular subject. @Jer979 can talk to the application of #blockchain outside "just" crypto currency.

Ironic how the best performing crypto right now is one being adopted by banks and the one with a degree of centralization

6843 2018-01-03 16:43:16 Not so sure...1 fiscal year in crypto could be years in potential returns . We all see coins go 10x in a matter of minutes. My opportunity cost of waiting a year is certainly over 10x not to mention the 1.4x could go up by 10x within a day lol

6845 2018-01-03 16:43:06 I missed the #XRP #ripple boat and I'm glad I did. It's not a crypto in the sense that I like to think of crypto. It's a centralised #fedcoin

6871 2018-01-03 16:41:14 And the nature of crypto currency allows for protection of its asset self. It’s a solid, abuseable system. Who would want to give that up?
6872 2018-01-03 16:41:06 Being aware is cool. But being logged out for two hours now isn't... Any compensations (or answer)... Starting to have real trust issues with you guys ! Regarding your crypto-wallet, any news ?

6886 2018-01-03 16:40:12 No (although 97%, which looks like it may be overstated, would be pretty extreme). It's just the behavioural implications of a herd that overwhelmingly male charging into crypto-world that seem interesting.
6887 2018-01-03 16:40:10 Side order of Bitconnect!
6888 2018-01-03 16:40:03 I agree. The fact that it has a governing body is concerning and goes against what makes most crypto appealing does worry me. For the price I got in at though, I'm feeling pretty comfortable with the gains I've seen so far.
6889 2018-01-03 16:39:59 The giant exchange rate is a bubble, no doubt, but the underlying technologies that create bitcoin are useful for traditional banking institutions and will continue to be even after Dogecoin4.2 takes over the crypto currency party.

6924 2018-01-03 16:37:44 I believe the concept of currency, in its purest form, is a method of bartering. I believe #Crypto is ultimately a form of bartering. Currencies are nothing more than one person agreeing with another person the amount of "time" they're willing to invest in the trade (more)

6934 2018-01-03 16:36:52 ADA at ICO was sold mostly to elderly Japanese men two years ago. Most of them don't even know what crypto is, thus there is a supply squeeze at the moment. Also Koreans are irrational buyers it seems. Proper valuation might come w/ Jap exchange listing

We believe that ecommerce is the key to empowerment. Earning crypto should be as simple as selling a few things around the home, instead of going through dozens of security checks, and bank account verifications.

6944 2018-01-03 16:36:14 The people who made the FUD and believed it will soon jump back on board and forget about it. Soon as it starts having a few up days in a row it will pick up momentum. The big crypto influencers are still a little scared by the rumours and will be promoting it again soon.

6947 2018-01-03 16:36:04 Dear Indian cryto investors.
Feel free to ask questions regarding crypto currency, blockchain and exchanges functioning in India.
Invest only what you can afford to lose. Crypto currency are subject to volatility.

6950 2018-01-03 16:35:58 I think someone needs to regulate new #CryptoCurrencies in market because more the alts. More the unstablity of main stream #CryptoMarkets.
A central/decentralized organization can do reviews and permit a crypto coin to get listed in markets

6975 2018-01-03 16:33:19 It really is a poor argument. Use a hardware wallet. Crypto does not yet have the same protections as fiat. If you like software wallets then there are wallets that use ledger as a second signature. doing so prevents malware and keyloggers from stealing your pins, seeds and coins

6988 2018-01-03 16:32:25 I'm always reminded of Gore Vidal calling William F Buckley a 'crypto-nazi' in 1968 whenever I hear these changing meanings of crypto. This usage makes absolutely no sense anymore.
6989 2018-01-03 16:32:24 Update, please ??? Is @eToro under attack?
6990 2018-01-03 16:32:22 so many people are going to get rekt on this.   People, if you invested in this, good for you.  Next steps:  1) take profits  2) RUN   $XRP
6991 2018-01-03 16:32:21 Well, don't let us down because your system can't let the TL work correct... Then just say in your DSQ, it can happen the TP is 5% down on the TP you've put it on. I've used TP in the past and it worked just fine at Etoro.
And yes a wallet please!! And a Etoro crypto 
6992 2018-01-03 16:32:20 Maybe in the near future. You will receive my input on sports news, Crypto and poker.
6993 2018-01-03 16:32:17 Crypto market is currently overvalued. Current market caps do not reflect the amount of market share currently held by crypto currencies.
6994 2018-01-03 16:32:11 Alts are testnets like always. First they tried parameter optimizations, then they discovered how to be centralized and still called "crypto", now they're showing economics - how to prepare mentally for the pace of Bitcoin growth we're about to witness
6995 2018-01-03 16:32:05 Your going to find there is a lot of pesimmist in this space. Always finding reasons why not to trade. I trade EVERYDAY and make money. The problem is those people are not traders their investors and there is a big difference.

7011 2018-01-03 16:30:53 yes. VC funds don't have to register w SEC bc they invest in private startups. they are allowed to hold up to 20% of assets in liquid securities (ie, after a portco goes public). crypto is liquid.

7036 2018-01-03 16:28:35 I don't have one, but from researching the Ledger wallets, it feels kind of scammy. Developers have to pay Ledger a ton of money to develop an app for it. Also you can't just use it for all the supported $crypto at once, since there's a limit to the # of wallets per device.

7058 2018-01-03 16:27:27 It’s extremely risky. The golden rule in crypto is “whoever holds the keys owns the crypto.” 
Exchanges get “hacked” regularly. Over 900,000 Bitcoin have been stolen since 2011. There isn’t much recourse. You’ll basically be told that you should have known better.

7062 2018-01-03 16:27:15 can't believe nobody is seeing that ripple (banks) have most of its XRP. They control the market ...making it appealing right now and forcing users to trade their btc and etc( limited and decentralize) for it. Once banks owns most BTC and eth, thats when 1M bitcoin happens

7065 2018-01-03 16:27:09 Be wise with your investment:

1) Never invest more than you can afford to lose
2) Never be greedy
3) Put part of your monthly incomings into crypto (also see number 1)
4) Always learn as crypto is always changing
5) Be happy with what you have, small amounts can make big impacts

7068 2018-01-03 16:26:54 Are charts all that important for <1m market cap coins? IMO ultra microcaps are more of an FA / volume play.

Awesome team behind #Enigma, I strongly believe it will be one of the biggest breakout coins of this year. Research this #crypto and decide if it's something you can get behind!
7071 2018-01-03 16:26:44 India is confused about its stand about Crypto-currencies. Stay away from it for now.

7073 2018-01-03 16:26:40 There is one question arising in my mind that our government planning to impose tax on profit which we earn in crypto market, why dont they pay back to citizens who incurred lose in this crypto market...?? If they can take then they can give also...!!

7077 2018-01-03 16:26:17 Interesting insight! I would argue it may be a mix (maybe 50/50 or a different split) of both. They coincide to push for the same concept but are driven by very different motivations (reasoning)

7123 2018-01-03 16:23:37 I suspect that some of the biggest challenges facing the new class of crypto millionaires will be overconfidence & confirmation bias.

They made one extraordinary bet.

But life has thousands of setups along the way.

7126 2018-01-03 16:23:32 Yeah, I mean, I can't say I predicted it, but it doesn't surprise me that some of the first public-facing businesses that go crypto cater to the sexual desires of men. They certainly are attuned to their demographic.

How would you go about cashing out money from a sale on Binance? Any other way besides transferring back to my gdax?

7203 2018-01-03 16:18:53 how do you expect to be taken seriously by the community you are targeting with this channel when at the same time you're revealing either dishonesty or missing understanding of crypto like that on it. pathetic.
7204 2018-01-03 16:18:48 Hello Haejin, i am curious as to what is your take on WAX coin?
7205 2018-01-03 16:18:47 yes you are right i believe in you and in verge
7206 2018-01-03 16:18:45 You could use a portfolio site/app instead
7207 2018-01-03 16:18:33 But only available on Hit exchange?!
7208 2018-01-03 16:18:33 Trading crypto
7209 2018-01-03 16:18:30 I would think the transaction fees and speed would be a deterrent to use bitcoin on Coinbase. And you can’t exchange currency on CB either so not sure how that’ll work.
7210 2018-01-03 16:18:28 True dat 
7211 2018-01-03 16:18:24 Do you own any crypto currencies??
7212 2018-01-03 16:18:20 Come on, dont be so negative
7213 2018-01-03 16:18:17 In less than a month I have more than doubled the worth of my crypto. I went from 270 to 544.
7214 2018-01-03 16:18:17 I agree wt crypto currency legalise nd taxable in India to make digital India nd avoid scam or fake currency.
7215 2018-01-03 16:18:10 You can create more out of thin air... like Fiat. Or in case of crypto.. another crypto. Precious metals aren’t money because everyone agreed they are... they’re money because they are the only things (elements) on the planet that have all the properties you need for sound money.
7216 2018-01-03 16:18:09 Good luck in your crypto world.
7217 2018-01-03 16:18:09 They changed it weeks ago due to the volatility of crypto.

First time #bitcoin buyers beware, this increase in price could well be buyers stocking up ready to use #btc to purchase #xrp #Ripple as soon as @coinbase adds it. This could result in a 4k drop in #btc price

7355 2018-01-03 16:10:16 No thanx.
7356 2018-01-03 16:10:13 : “Ripple can f– off. They’re the Intel of crypto – backdoored from the start”. This is gold. Technically true too.

7398 2018-01-03 16:07:54 You likewise. Both could be right and wrong. But, my friend, set a reminder on the last day of 2018 and let's see alright?

7401 2018-01-03 16:07:45 I buy and sell stocks- big difference. As you put it these fake currencies have a following. That’s the fascinating part. And no one can even explain what it is. Maybe dollar has issues. But crypto is crazy. Concept good , value not so good. There is more harm in crypto than +
7402 2018-01-03 16:07:28 That would be real cool, a centralized bank coin. What else can we do to completely ruin crypto? Fuck off ripple

7451 2018-01-03 16:04:59 It’s the lies of the people running bitcoin cash that concern me more
7452 2018-01-03 16:04:52 Ben, the entire market is only 700b, on a global scale that is nothing.  There are still individuals that have almost as much money as entire crypto markets.  It is just the beginning.
7453 2018-01-03 16:04:51 Dream scenario: Smart money moves to ETH/BTC, Shitcoins suffers 90% correction, noobs panic and sell at a loss. More probable: Entire crypto market suffers major correction, noobs get away with 9000% gains buying ripple, eos and cardano

7458 2018-01-03 16:04:39 Some reason? People want to catch a 40% ride on BTC when it pumps next it's blasting to 25k
7459 2018-01-03 16:04:24 What they mean is, they will not allow cryptos and can't protect us if anything wrong happens ... who the hell need protection from these fcuking leaders

I think it's largely from needing to unite in order to fight misconceptions of the massive numbers of new crypto-interactors with big voices who use them ignorantly or self-servingly.

7493 2018-01-03 16:01:57 Has Andreas ever publicly thanked you for your amazing contribution?
7494 2018-01-03 16:01:56 Why not a bull run? Not based on what?
7495 2018-01-03 16:01:50 Count me in
7496 2018-01-03 16:01:34 you’re just showing you don’t have the right attitude to be a crypto trader!!
7497 2018-01-03 16:01:34 I think ive learned the secret to trading alts in crypto.  Don’t buy into FOMO, DYOR and don’t pleb out and sell when BTC is going up.  Also, most of the experienced traders around here are more than happy to help us new guys.  Use them. @nondualnelly @cryptodemedici @crypto_rand
7498 2018-01-03 16:01:25 Also I was referring to Ripple regarding the banks. I misinterpreted your tweet

7506 2018-01-03 16:00:36 Is the issue technical or is it related to volumes being bought (steep crypto trends) ?
7507 2018-01-03 16:00:34 If you can put a little money on Crypto Currency there some crazy things happening and people are making bucket loads of money
7508 2018-01-03 16:00:32 can you trade crypto on margin        : )

7512 2018-01-03 16:00:20 $Nas Nebulas to the moon as predicted. This is just the beginning. It is the Google of blockchain. Nebulas will change the world of crypto like Google changed the Internet. Still going cheap at around 6.50 USD. #Nas
7513 2018-01-03 16:00:20 I’ve made money on azfl. It may not be a quality stock like Apple but good and bad investments make money. Crypto is a fad that will be replaced by yet another coin developed by the banks. You’ll see. Banks don’t want to miss out. They will back it, insure it and regulate

7538 2018-01-03 15:58:28 I don't live in the US. I think any Americans involved in $crypto should get to Puerto Rico or get an Estonian e-residency and e-holdings corp until US tax law is overhauled to be simpler so compliance is feasible.

7560 2018-01-03 15:57:00 I think the hilarious part is that you think crypto is a scam, but $AZFL is a winner. The key here is that it is a decentralized store of value given value by the marketplace. And it can’t be diluted to death the way stocks like $AZFL are.
7561 2018-01-03 15:56:57 Be careful giving crypto advice to friends or family. If it goes up they love you, if it goes down then your relationship will be damaged.

7565 2018-01-03 15:56:45 Fair enough, bashing other coins is not healthy for the overall crypto market.

Let's wait and see who ends up being wanted by big companies and I'll give you another clue.

It's not going to be Ripple.
7566 2018-01-03 15:56:43 @StellarLumens finally managed to jump onto Stellar - total newby to Crypto...anyone got any price predicts - this baby looks as if Mars is next never mind the moon...stunned by what I have read from the charts! Thanks
7567 2018-01-03 15:56:42 What’s wild is Ripple ($XRP) is the only crypto decentralized. In fact the only way to purchase it is with ETH or BTC.
7568 2018-01-03 15:56:33 Than we have to use other crypto...

In his view, scaling the network is "the single most important key technical challenge" that developers need to work on before blockchain applications can be widely used.

7578 2018-01-03 15:56:00 He was all in on Verge, as was I, until it imploded and became a PR disaster.

Everyone in Crypto outside of current investors thinks it's a joke. Meaning the profits won't come for a while.

It's a coin you can invest in later, nows not the time.
7579 2018-01-03 15:55:47 I have a feeling it might. The crypto space is primed for a staggering black swan event (probably requires it) and $XRP is totally set up to be the one.
7580 2018-01-03 15:55:39 No exchanges at this point have an excuse for delays on support tickets and account verification. On top of that exchanges know what’s coming so beef up your servers. If they can’t see the line of people trying to get into crypto, then they’re blind.

7630 2018-01-03 15:52:11 but $XMY is already on Bittrex and Cryptopia... most coins dream to get on Bittrex and make crowdfunding campaigns to collect the fees for Cryptopia.. IMO exchange-wise is pretty well positioned!

7666 2018-01-03 15:50:10 The quicker method is to skip Step 1, 2, and 3. Instead…. just start sharing as you learn, be honest, own up, and engage others you respect humbly. That’ll make it faster.

7673 2018-01-03 15:49:31 Yes, I do believe that we will know that crypto has matured once governments around the world have been almost eliminated. That’s the biggest thing that is about to be disrupted. The way we all live is about to be revolutionized over the next few decades.
7674 2018-01-03 15:49:25 Sur Bitcoin et les Crypto-monnaies, je pense que tu as tout faux, surtout sur la lutte anti-corruption. La morale mafieuse n'a rien à voir avec le Crypto-Anarchiste ou l'Anarchisme. Que tu pestes sur les Crypto-Libertariens, oui, mais pas sur les Crypto-Anarchistes.

7683 2018-01-03 15:47:59 we're all addicted to something at any one point of our lives (to the idea of loving someone/work/crypto), now included. the addiction is actually just a distraction from the fact that we're all inherently lonely

7686 2018-01-03 15:47:53 Crypto cryptic in this world of Cryptocurrency one must do his homework and act with accurate information and not his emotions as well.
7687 2018-01-03 15:47:53 Guys, DO NOT consider me as a crypto expert who gives various signals. I AM NOT! I just share what I consider as a good coin, but I'm a human being, so I could be wrong sometimes.
7688 2018-01-03 15:47:49 1/2 Statistically 1 is correct. But trading is not only maths. The crypto market is super volatile and extremely sensitive. The ICO might reach 10x but you really can't predict the surroundings a year further. Just not possible.
7689 2018-01-03 15:47:45 It’s going to hit it today 
7690 2018-01-03 15:47:43 Good shit man
7691 2018-01-03 15:47:24 Exactly!

I have 6 different coins and have done awesome with all of them. Not because I’m some crypto Nostradamus, but because 95% of the coins out there are doing awesome. (As you said - for now)
7692 2018-01-03 15:47:24 Will it dip again in the next few days.

7703 2018-01-03 15:46:23 #Ripple posted 37,000% Ytd return in 2017

New investors see the price at ~$2.50 and think it’s cheap!

What they fail to realize is that there are over 38bn in supply

This values the currency at over $95bn and 2nd in total crypto market cap.

What do you think about #Xrp value?

7727 2018-01-03 15:44:34 Hey dudecomedy. Looking into buying ripple and other crypto currencies. What site do you suggest using thats pretty secure since they not on coinbase yet? @DudeComedy
7728 2018-01-03 15:44:31 It's crazy, man. You can just about call any coin on Binance under a dollar. "This coin is going to go up" is such an easy call at this point. I hardly know anything about crypto, and every single coin I've gotten into has gone 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, etc, it's original price.
7729 2018-01-03 15:44:16 i've been among those saying it's not that easy to trade crypto on margin — and that's true of most exchanges and brokerages. but i forgot about the CFD people, since they don't own any actual crypto!
7730 2018-01-03 15:44:16 those hating on crypto...give it a go...once u start you'll see the difference...i was one of those that was on sidelines cynical about crypto not long ago
7731 2018-01-03 15:44:03 Hi, I am not a crypto expert. I just recommended what I had considered as a coin with a good potential. So you should make some your own researchment. Don't count on me. I could be wrong.

7808 2018-01-03 15:38:16 We will see.$Eth is a victim to its own success. It cannot run all the projects on its chain (crypto kitties?) neo will go the same way.$Kmd however can provide asset chains for its projects and they cant slow kmd no matter how popular they become. 1st dico opens the flood gates.
7809 2018-01-03 15:38:15 I just started and put $100 into ripple, but now fear due to my budget that I may miss out on whale like gains. Just didn’t want to go in debt or starve to get in crypto
7810 2018-01-03 15:38:14 Religion is like politics, what suits the powerful best is either "haram" or "halal". This changes over time. Everone on the planet should decide for himself, what suits him/her best. Especially in Egypt, people will need crypto in order to survive.
7811 2018-01-03 15:38:11 Taking profit on the way up is smart. I took profits at 2600, 3700, and 5800 sats. Not selling it all at once, that's key more than anything (my opinion anyhow).

7821 2018-01-03 15:37:17 Bitcoin is a sick anarcho-capitalist idea. Legislation can be undone. Decentralized crypto currency with no legal tender is a tool for money laundering.

7848 2018-01-03 15:35:12 Max, the problem with crypto is that it is not representational, no base intrinsic value like a commodity. But sorry, the Mufti is not mentioning that the entire economic structure is not "Halal" You can make crypto "Kosher" by making it tied to a physical asset.  Peace

7912 2018-01-03 15:30:54 Crypto-fascist racist? Are you referring to their way of communicating? What do you  mean by "crypto"?
7913 2018-01-03 15:30:54 I realised i made a typo. I pick up some at 9k-11k  Couple days back. Hahah!
7914 2018-01-03 15:30:50 So many people on here giving themselves the title of professional crypto trader because they made a few correct calls.

Be weary - It is a heavy bull market. Hard to miss right now, they likely don’t know much more than you! $XRP $XLM $REQ $TRX
7915 2018-01-03 15:30:48 OK crypto twitter, there is a thing called over-shilling ...stahp
7916 2018-01-03 15:30:45 sadly, the mentioning of $xvg aka dogecoin-dark aka "not even the only feature i have works" and $xrp aka capitalism-coin aka bagfullofshit doesn't make u any more trustworthy than $kin. A good company does simply not present tech-fundamentals  which don't work out.
7917 2018-01-03 15:30:44 Cannot believe the market cap in #crypto is more than 700 billion, and it's nice to see that $BTC dominance is at 35%. Looks like alts are breaking out!
7918 2018-01-03 15:30:38 It would be nice to have more of the best crypto asset! TRX

7923 2018-01-03 15:30:08 I'm wondering what ripple can do that you love it? If ADA, IOTA, .. others could deliver what they promised their price were over 200$ not 1$. People are betting on sth which maybe huge, that'a all in crypto world.

7935 2018-01-03 15:29:27 That is true of almost every UX/UI in the crypto world including most wallets, etc. We do have a very loooong way to go. It reminds me of 1995 when everything was being built by developers that didn't care about UI, just using the tech. It will change, but needs to happen sooner.

8031 2018-01-03 15:22:08 LOL. When there's no way to mine a coin, there's no peer-to-peer consensus, therefore it' not crypto. No peer-to-peer consensus means no total cap, reversible transactions, kill switch, etc..
8032 2018-01-03 15:22:02 Trading $CRYPTO is actually quite easy. The problem is, there are a few prerequisites for it, which most don't have in that exact combination: sharp brain, big balls, hard work and patience.

8063 2018-01-03 15:19:50 Apparently they've had it for a while, though I never looked directly. I don't like CFDs for #crypto, there's no need for them, you can just buy/sell the asset easily enough

8086 2018-01-03 15:18:20 Yes. Because you tweet the same thing constantly. You think crypto is a scam, and it’s always at a top. Then you pull an occasional I told you so tweet from your hundreds of “calls” on any dip to give yourself some sense of credibility.
8087 2018-01-03 15:18:20 I like what you're doing. Thank you. 
8088 2018-01-03 15:18:19 I would agree specifically from crypto currencies perspective

8091 2018-01-03 15:18:08 Scott, I’ve done both now. Lego has hit its peak but is pretty fun n for a hobby. Requires a lot of inventory space. Crypto in general is more lucrative
8092 2018-01-03 15:18:06 it's the most tweeted about crypto for 2 weeks now and it's still stuck. Ain't no tweets saving it without a massive release
8093 2018-01-03 15:18:03 I disagree with you there, transforming a company with a billion dollar valuation into an entity that supports a crypto eco system doesn’t happen over night.

8106 2018-01-03 15:17:41 Another reason I deal with crypto now:

I made a transfer to my bank yesterday from another bank account. The money is not in either account now. It’s not even showing as a pending. My money is just in the ether with no way for me to trace it. I just have to trust the system

8149 2018-01-03 15:15:01 Since starting crypto 3 weeks ago, I’ve officially made +$500 in profit.
8150 2018-01-03 15:14:55 Hmm seems on binance I can only buy crypto using only other crypto, possible to buy using non crypto currency?
8151 2018-01-03 15:14:52 
8152 2018-01-03 15:14:48 Nope, not at all. The public key alone can only be used to put money nye into the wallet. You’d need to have the private key - which you never share with anyone - to take the funds
8153 2018-01-03 15:14:48 A few months ago investors told me they have “ICO fatigue”. Now I’m hearing about many new funds investing in crypto and pre-sales, along with a whole WhatsApp group I’m on that only talks about which Alt coins they should buy. Things move quick in crypto land!

8164 2018-01-03 15:13:54 Reality is that #bitcoin has way more lost coins than any other crypto with some significance in coinmarketcap calculations. Lopp just in the loop spreading false narrative to mask core failures on a daily basis.

8171 2018-01-03 15:13:29 My point was essentially they hate XRP because it’s only just a “centralized bank coin” when it really isn’t that, while continue to praise the gains they’ve made on XLM. Double standards?

8194 2018-01-03 15:12:06 Trading crypto sangat kacau, belum 1 minggu udah balik modal. GGWP
8195 2018-01-03 15:12:03 Loser are those who still hold. The coin is dead.
8196 2018-01-03 15:12:02 Made my first $1,000 off of crypto. It's not much but for Ripple to still be under $3.00 I can't complain. Now it's time to really start day trading with other alt coin 
8197 2018-01-03 15:12:00 Trade crypto in 2018.  Im telling you .. its the move.  If your not doing it by now your actually wrong.  Get this money its free right now
8198 2018-01-03 15:11:59 I am probably wrong, but open source currency (aka crypto) is like the Myspace of the last few years. Myspace was raging hot, then most of realized it is just messy to have everyone have their own space. FB brought uniformity and won. That's why people like fiat. It's uniformity

8200 2018-01-03 15:11:55 @caiocgomes mais ou menos quantos % do teu portfolio de investimentos ta em crypto? 
8201 2018-01-03 15:11:44 100 JPY(BTC): 1152.329 ~ 1152.419 KRW(BTC)
8202 2018-01-03 15:11:37 Come on, let's get real, there is no such a thing as crypto economists, just as there is no such a thing as equities economist or forex economist.
8203 2018-01-03 15:11:36 Although I agree with you, there's still the risk that btc ends up being replaced by some other coin such as bitcoin cash during some big uncertainty period. Btc is not exempt of risk although its the most conservative investment within the crypto space
8204 2018-01-03 15:11:33 #XLM , #XRP , #ADA WHAT a week for them. All coins at least 150% up in a week! Just watch #TRX the coming weeks, #TRON will follow again. #lovecrypto #crypto #BTC

8209 2018-01-03 15:11:05 He can’t tell u how so because he doesn’t know. Like so many they think it’s overnight fortune and if it isn’t on a bull run it’s trash. Biggest problem with crypto is the uneducated

8216 2018-01-03 15:10:39 The Forbe's and CNBC articles have added to it as well. Every day investors, new to crypto are all learning about XRP and wanting in. I think a portion is because they see it as affordable compared to BTC's steep price per token.

8220 2018-01-03 15:10:23 It's not a "low crypto". You're looking at coin price and not market cap

8222 2018-01-03 15:10:19 Crypto is no bubble !  Banks were the fraud in the dotcom bubble ! Banks are always the fraudulent parties!
8223 2018-01-03 15:09:55 Stay humble in $crypto. Just because you made a little money or 1 good trade doesnt mean you know the entire market now. Always be open to learn.

8231 2018-01-03 15:09:14 Hello Crypto Twitter #myfirstTweet
8232 2018-01-03 15:09:09 @Coinrypto I know you are probably inundated with requests but can you add other currencies to the price per coin field Using Binance I have bought most of my crypto with bitcoin and ETH so US$ value does not compute TIA
8233 2018-01-03 15:09:05 To identify a trend ... sure, looks same yeah just dont build your trading plan on it.
8234 2018-01-03 15:09:05 I agree (though I’m pretty relaxed about Catalonia). Just think Crypto moves more about get-rich-quick and “it’s the new paradigm though I can’t really explain how” thinking. Same guys would’ve been flipping off-plans condos in Florida in 2005.
8235 2018-01-03 15:08:54 BCHの取り出し完了。Electron Cashをインストールすると，Electrumに入っているウォレットが全部見え，BCHが動かせるので，用意しておいた別のBCHウォレットにすぐに送金。送金手数料もBTCよりずっと安かった。private keyでの移動よりずっと楽。

8244 2018-01-03 15:08:17 Why is everybody freaking out when one #crypto drops a few percent? Don't you have a diversified portfolio that will make up for the loss? Currently holding 50% #btc , 20% $eth & 30% alts (#xvg , #trx , #xrp) #HODL

8267 2018-01-03 15:06:49 Curious! It seems that for good work to thrive in the bitcoin space, proof of work must be addressed. Anyone working on fixing proof of work or want to? We will help PM and be the neutral party to help push this effort forward for the good of crypto if enough people care.
8268 2018-01-03 15:06:48 Thankful for my team. I know exactly where to invest in crypto & trade it in the forex market!
8269 2018-01-03 15:06:46 I doubt people that were in crypto at the beginning of this year would ask for a bailout in the remote case we will get to that situation. Can't vouch for the latecomers that jumped in for a quick buck though.

8292 2018-01-03 15:05:39 Welcome to 2018 

A few tips for people who are still quite young within the crypto universe. 1.Create a game plan  
2.Have set goals and stick to them no matter the #FUD and #FOMO 
3.Dont be afraid to ask questions, it’s a big world full of ever evolving technology.
8293 2018-01-03 15:05:38 It’s a beautiful day to be alive in the crypto market

Dumbledore, I seek your opinion. I am a very confused being at this time.
Some say its decentralized, some say it's not. Some hate it. Some love it. 
The controversy is real with this one. #ripple , do you think it belongs to the cypto world master?

8317 2018-01-03 15:03:41 2% fees for purchases at least, not sure about when you sell. And again, the crypto you hold can only be held in-app, and for now can't be transferred outside of it.
8318 2018-01-03 15:03:39 Already follow him. Hes a genius. Been learning from his videos lately.

Crypto currency.

8340 2018-01-03 15:01:45 I’ve increased my holdings but technically until I cash out it’s all paper gains.  On average, by day trading, I doubled the amount of bitcoin and ethereum I own in December.  If I were you, I’d start with “why do I want to invest in crypto?”.... what’s your reason?

8416 2018-01-03 14:57:11 Ripple has already gone 30,000% in a year.

Semoga masih bisa ikutan pesta ini dan gak cuma jadi tukang cuci piring.
8494 2018-01-03 14:53:09 Quick (and lazy) question - what are the best #cryptos out there primarily aimed at #insurance? @NickSzabo4 mentioned its one of the best user cases for the space... appreciate any tips to go research 
8495 2018-01-03 14:53:08 $XRP enjoying another sustained and organic bull run. Only a matter of time before the majority of #FUDsters try and join the breakout.

@Ripple is paving the way of the next revolution and I couldn't be happier to be along for the ride.

8500 2018-01-03 14:53:01 One interesting thing I noticed. In US lots of high-profile folks and institutional investors prefer $ZEC over $XMR, $XZC with also some mentions of $ZEN being a US-based team. In Europe, $XMR seems to be a sentiment leader. #Anonymity #Coins #Crypto
8501 2018-01-03 14:52:49 Dude I had an awful day.  Panic sold most of my alts, then did a scam ICO to try and quickly make the gains back.  Lost $5k.  Don't use @wanchainorg wanit's a clone of @wanchain_org Twitter and website 100% cloned.
8502 2018-01-03 14:52:44 When evaluating crypto mining/lending platforms you have to consider two main risks.  The opportunity cost of not just #hodling coins for 2x-10x gains.  In addition, the days to break even on you investment since a company is centralized and has a high probability of failure.

8546 2018-01-03 14:50:30 Unfortunately when you look at the Crypto environment there are still too many people trolling around looking for quick gains. I would see it as a compliment, clearly what is happening at XRP is having an effect on the everyday Crypvester... even the really pathetic ones
8547 2018-01-03 14:50:22 Seems like crypto altcoins are on at the moment 2x plus returns this past week... #crypto #altcoins
8548 2018-01-03 14:50:21 @DigaTrade - best starting point for those looking for publicly traded crypto companies and those just dipping their toes into altcoins.

8559 2018-01-03 14:49:59 Don’t know when but we could see it back into 700’s or it could skyrocket again and find new support closer to 1000+ sorry I can’t read this one clearly but just take some profits occasionally up to burn invade it tanks for some reason

8595 2018-01-03 14:47:02 you think it is gonna correct overnight or it will take longer?
8596 2018-01-03 14:47:01 I beg to disagree here: it depends if there are more opportunities on the market or not. If there are at least 6 other ICOs with +40% profits during that year, then it is more profitable to go for them than to lock the capital in the first one.
8597 2018-01-03 14:47:00 100 mio is already live
8598 2018-01-03 14:46:52 Maybe the real question is why would a company like Steam deal with the technical debt on using a trustless crypto locked L2 solution when they can just store a number on a Mysql db and achieve exactly the same thing as payment channels and micropayments.

8630 2018-01-03 14:45:09 Did you know that Mr. Chris P.Thompson included Mooncoin in his book about Cryptocurrency? At the moment he is working on a new book 'Mooncoin. Philosophy of Decentralisation'!

8632 2018-01-03 14:45:05 You either just bought into $QSP or your portfolio is FIRE if $QSP is your worst performing crypto!
8633 2018-01-03 14:45:03 Crypto has brought so many illiterate millionaires, I'm afraid of the future.

8635 2018-01-03 14:45:01 SAD. Example: If portfolio was worth 0,00700000BTC (700 000 coins on coinexchange for 1 satoshi) after conversion it became only 700 coins of kb3 with price of 170 satoshi - it is 0,00119000BTC.  0,00700000-0,00119000=0.00581000 it's over 80% LOSS instant.
8636 2018-01-03 14:44:59 There's now an ETF called $DOGS -- Unfortunately it's not a play on man's best friend or even dog-related crypto currencies, it's a play on buying the worst performing international stocks in hopes of mean reversion.
8637 2018-01-03 14:44:57 $100 million hedge fund should be live before the coinbase listing - it'll grow 2x overnight !
8638 2018-01-03 14:44:41 I am a student so I do not have enough money. I am in crypto but with just 50 bucks, because I cannot afford more. Such a boost would help me out a lot.
8639 2018-01-03 14:44:31 I know. Once we break the resistance it should become support tho. We might see some more consolidation but once a 4h candle closes above we’ll be at 16k in no time. Personally I’m hoping for it to reject and retrace to the 14k area to open my long :p

8645 2018-01-03 14:44:04 Hopefully not by having to actively trade the entire time to make a living. There will not always be a market as lucrative as this one.
We should be aiming to make enough to cover  our needs for decades to come while this market is hot and this emerging technology blossoms.

8657 2018-01-03 14:43:19 Yeah expected but pushing higher overall is a good sign.

8659 2018-01-03 14:43:17 爆上げきたら下げ怖いし1部利確するためにバイナンスにうつそうかな
8660 2018-01-03 14:43:16 no, did you open it? It's like a platform to introduce crypto to those who have not started using. you can still get some if you already use
8661 2018-01-03 14:43:14 When the price go down more than 60% its called scam dude.. Go check coinmarketcap.. Nxt is on the list of third biggest losers in the crypto world for two weeks and it will continue until end 2018
8662 2018-01-03 14:43:14 i keep hearing that argument. but that assumes the future crypto market opportunity is equal to what the future internet opportunity was worth. it could be way more or way less.

8668 2018-01-03 14:42:33 Sounds like a great idea to me. Let's don't forget we are roughly in the 1% group of those who knows/owns crypto  (worldwide)
8669 2018-01-03 14:42:27 Why don't more people believe in win-win scenarios?  I'm happy your investment is working out for you!  You can be happy mine is working out too!  We are all in this crazy crypto space together. There is lots of profit to be made for everyone.

8675 2018-01-03 14:41:58 All about what's happening now. Ever seen such growth in a week for any crypto? Just a mere pump. See its downfall in a week #xrp #ripple
8676 2018-01-03 14:41:55 People day trading #crypto right now make no sense.  Buy low and #HODL - There is going to be so much new money in the market in 2018.
8677 2018-01-03 14:41:51 From one aqueous being to another, thanks Croc! Great call on $XLM there btw. :)
8678 2018-01-03 14:41:46 Need new crypto Telegram chats to join. Any recommendations?
8679 2018-01-03 14:41:41 Hmm I've been following him (on and off) for years and he doesn't seem like the scammy type.. If he is he certainly could have made a lot more off his followers. Are these ICOs legit promising? Transparency of paid shilling is a good thing of course..
8680 2018-01-03 14:41:41 How about taxes? When you buy items with tenX card, do you need to pay taxes for profit gains with crypto?

8683 2018-01-03 14:41:32 The problem now is they are mentioning (or going to mention) tons of other $crypto that is worthless, but people will buy because it's mentioned on tv.
8684 2018-01-03 14:41:30 He did say that alright

8709 2018-01-03 14:38:51 Kinda hard to think how crypto will impact the fire service and emergency response...but who knows...maybe my next one.
8710 2018-01-03 14:38:47 As a crypto newbie.  I enjoy following you both.
8711 2018-01-03 14:38:45 Decentralised exchange of solar power on the power grid. Peer to peer. They have government contracts already and there are rumours of large companies preparing to partner with them (not sure about the Tesla one).
I might be biased though as $POWR is Australian, as am I.
8712 2018-01-03 14:38:43 I bought RDD through my @CoinomiWallet.  They have built in exchanges (both @ShapeShift_io & @echangelly) that you can use the bigger coins, and even some smaller ones (like #XVG) to trade for RDD.  You can also then trade your RDD for other #crypto, if you so desire.
8713 2018-01-03 14:38:41 Get the blue tick guys! @electroneum had the same problem
8714 2018-01-03 14:38:35 You know its alt season when...
8715 2018-01-03 14:38:34 Etn please
8716 2018-01-03 14:38:34 Interesting. Any reason why it needs to be it’s own coin? Rather than using LTC or some other fast crypto. I don’t think there’s space for every single use case to have their own currency - it’s too confusing for the average consumer
8717 2018-01-03 14:38:33 Stocks open higher again with SandP at 2700. Nvidia jumps another $5 chip stocks leading. Market looking healthy. Rally in crypto overnight. GK Crypto 1000 up 15.3% YTD Rally in #ETH #XRP #ada #bitcoin

Don’t forget though everyone can still do the ICO Crowdsale don’t miss it! MS Alibaba NEO
8727 2018-01-03 14:37:16 It's too bad. Went to pick up a copy, added to cart and didn't see a crypto payment option. Didn't buy.
8728 2018-01-03 14:37:12 you do get that ripple is fast and cheap because it is centralized? visa is also fast and cheap. the idea of crypto is decentralization.
8729 2018-01-03 14:37:11 I am in both usd/btc eventhough some of my bags crying like bleed from the nose ;) heh
8730 2018-01-03 14:37:04 People are doing bounties for that, with crypto payout and sometimes even more blockchain powered. Eg oscoin, staketree, and probably more.
8731 2018-01-03 14:37:03 And by the way, they are not shares, they are crypto coins, a huge difference between the two.

8751 2018-01-03 14:35:56 Dit gaan nutteloos wees.

8772 2018-01-03 14:34:11 Trading crypto makes me feel like the wolf of wall street. But without the parties, drugs, yachts. I guess the rags to riches off of unknown penny stocks is where the comparison ends.

8901 2018-01-03 14:25:32 I’m convinced xrp a scam by the banks, way to fishy that you can only buy it with crypto not usd. Cause the banks are trying to load up on crypto for when it jumps to crazy numbers

8909 2018-01-03 14:25:13 I don’t get it. Are there algorithms trained to buy on any mentions of crypto? I can’t believe anyone actually thinks this brings value to the company

8916 2018-01-03 14:24:24 It’s not hard...it’s just that many Indian exchanges have disabled deposits due to some payment gateway issues... rumors are that the banks have got some govt orders to stop dealing in crypto...we are just waiting for an update....

8924 2018-01-03 14:23:54 Yeah. Similar to what you have done recently with Ada. Sell at a top and buy back lower for only a 4% gain. But adds up if you do it 10 times!

I know Pivot Reversal + Sentiment indicators used in traditional and forex markets. Do you use these in Crypto for this type of thing?
8925 2018-01-03 14:23:47 coinbase上場するとか言ってるのに売るとか頭沸いてるの？？？？？？^^
8926 2018-01-03 14:23:46 If you miss out on $XLM, you have yourself to blame. It is the most undervalued crypto out there, does the same thing as $XRP but is open source and possibly an international trade solution and its decentralized. Developed by the same ripple developer as an improvement on tech.

8940 2018-01-03 14:22:46 I’m bullish on crypto... in a big big way. I’m bullish on blockchain as a major cultural disruption. I don’t care if you agree. #blockchain $btc $eth
8941 2018-01-03 14:22:46 Do you think that it will rise more today?
8942 2018-01-03 14:22:44 Yeah I took your advice...appreciate the call

8946 2018-01-03 14:22:41 @lopp do you hold any coins other than Bitcoin? What do you think of those of us building crypto market index funds to capture the performance of the whole market? Is it better to diversify or just buy BTC and HODL?
8947 2018-01-03 14:22:29 @archillect
8948 2018-01-03 14:22:18 Je me suis concentré que sur Bitcoin et Ethereum. Honnêtement, je suis un idéaliste de la crypto-monnaie, donc j'aurai préféré une utilisation plus pragmatique, comme une utilisation massive dans des zones non bancarisés. Trop romantique surement.
8949 2018-01-03 14:22:12 Find quality companies via research on the Management Team, Assets and History and you shouldn't be shafted. Those that get shafted are probably those that are lazy. Steering clear of Crypto but good luck there!

8968 2018-01-03 14:20:57 A very important thing to understand about crypto, 95% of the coins will not survive when this surge ends.  But the short term ROI opportunities are far from over. When the dust settles, the crypto's that survive will go on to be some of the most powerful companies in the world!

9040 2018-01-03 14:15:39 If you miss out on $XLM, you have yourself to blame. It is the most undervalued crypto out there, does the same thing as $XRP but is open source and possibly an international trade solution and its decentralized. Developed by the same ripple developer as an improvement on tech.
9041 2018-01-03 14:15:33 You are the Gandalf of #crypto.

9043 2018-01-03 14:15:19 @bitconnect is not a ponzi scheme, but it does rob it's users of the true benefits and opportunities of ground floor gains in crypto.  It reduces life changing gains to a MLM, @marykay style revenue stream. Mine BTC and HODL ALTS FTW.

This is crypto, you have peoplehere who have much more success, that don't say a peep. if you have to be defensive about "discredit criticism" then you are in the wrong business. besides the beauty about the crypto is  there's a #blockchain. you have nothing to prove.

9246 2018-01-03 14:01:13 noooooooooo!  please tell everyone to stop pounding this for another few months until I can mine up a huge sack gdi, ffs ...  this is NOT the crypto you are looking for!!!
9247 2018-01-03 14:01:11 Most likely ill be laughed upon once it goes up, but i rather choose that, than being the one who didnt voice his opinion about a centralized Banking Token before we had the chance to avoid it, no matter how "rich" you get trading it.
It contradicts Crypto in the first place.

9257 2018-01-03 14:00:41 Yeah I think +500 allows for a certain amount of limited betting on crypto prices now. This is definitely one worth keeping an eye on, as you say. The UK needs more crypto infrastructure & competition.
9258 2018-01-03 14:00:41 is Etherdelta actually safe now?
9259 2018-01-03 14:00:35 Dipping my toe in on $DNR.... excuse the pun

9263 2018-01-03 14:00:22 So I should starve and sell my house just because a coin is about to moon? you need to spend money anyway, might as well do it through crypto ;)
9264 2018-01-03 14:00:21 Totally agree. I got really into this technology this year, crypto and blockchain future possibilities but the energy issue needs to be tackled with as much enthusiasm as block size, privacy, fees, speculation, etc.
9265 2018-01-03 14:00:17 Definitely one of the most strong hands in $crypto. I consider myself a long term holder but compared to him it feels like I have weak hands. Nothing but respect!
9266 2018-01-03 14:00:13 ripple is crypto?
9267 2018-01-03 14:00:12 When dealing with tech there will ALWAYS be issues. What determines if it has a future is the team behind it. When the node had issues all transfers were still recorded on the network just not being picked up by the node. XRB team had a workaround ready and then fixed it.

9269 2018-01-03 14:00:06 Not hearing much about SALT in the crypto media.  Would have thought there would have been some noise, as there isn't an abundance of apps in production on the Ethereum platform.

9282 2018-01-03 13:59:45 Thanks for a good respond. I just think your tweets are borderline to what you are accusing others to do. Everybody are responsible to do their own due diligence and a lot of the cryptos on the market are ideas only at this stage. Crypto investments is a gamble.

9360 2018-01-03 13:54:29 It was a manipulation, a group of people moved AltC into BTC, then people followed but this group bought back the AltC and so BTC did not rise that much.

9383 2018-01-03 13:53:17 Your argument - “XRP can’t be worth much because that means it’s market cap would be huge...and that’s just too big.” Your logic is superior sir! Haha!

9389 2018-01-03 13:52:45 Her ethics are in question because she works for JP Morgan I'm guessing. Her boss "hates" crypto, but at the same time, is buying and building crypto platforms
9390 2018-01-03 13:52:45 Maybe they just don't have the date... Look at what announcing a date did to $XVG. They announced a wallet date, it's a new project, why is everyone in the crypto community so impatient.

9393 2018-01-03 13:52:35 Crees que es la mejor plataforma para comprar crypto? O alguna app de iOS con tasas bajas? Lo de e-toro y las comisiones me parece un poco estafa... alguna recomendacion para empezar en el mundillo?

Get comfortable using horizontal levels and picking out key swing highs/lows

Lots of information can be derived from key levels & swing points being breached

I like and look at diagonal lines & chart patterns, but this style (IMHO) is v. overrepresented in $crypto

9415 2018-01-03 13:51:23 We might see a new ATH today in $XRP. All these surges are free bonuses before actual rally starts later this month ( may be next week ). Grab it while you can. #ripple #crypto #xrpthestandard

Most do no not have  a product.  believe it is good to diversify from the main coins and have profited from your help,  but there is a always an answer if you follow the money.  Asia based spec trading? not US retail?

9442 2018-01-03 13:49:31 A chart can save any company...

What Verge pulled with their amateur hour routine when all the lights were on and cameras rolling will not reverse the chart. In these situations a delay will occur, slight TA adjustments are made, and then the chart will still have its day.

9455 2018-01-03 13:48:50 Isn't it risky posting a wallet address publicly? I want verge too but I really am new to tech and don't understand what to post. Please explain
9456 2018-01-03 13:48:48 I don’t disagree with you regarding need to regulate some parts of crypto. But, speculation is entirely healthy. People should be responsible with their money. If a investment loss is painful, then they did not understand the risk, and should have never taken it on.

9551 2018-01-03 13:41:38 This is a genuine question coming from a friend of mine, If you were just starting in crypto with a budget of $1k How would you invest it to make the biggest profit? I have my own answer but would like to hear yours...
9552 2018-01-03 13:41:37 THANK YOU!
9553 2018-01-03 13:41:36 It's worth having low balls if you have spare BTC you would otherwise just hold. 16k-17k lowest IMO

Yesterday it dipped when BTC started taking a run - EVERY alt dipped. Vechain recovered so fast lol. It's events like that, or a whale dumping, which could get your order filled
9554 2018-01-03 13:41:32 I’m going to make my own crypto currency and get rich! Just need a hip name.  I’m leaning toward ElectroRacks, but I’m up for suggestions...
9555 2018-01-03 13:41:24 You are being intellectually dishonest with this post. People are in crypto to make money. You buy coins you think will yield you a profit. If people truly cared about financial sovereignty, the market wouldn't be upside down every two hours.

9590 2018-01-03 13:38:47 Crypto is a strange world right now. In the stock market people kill for a 10% annual return. Right now people are passing up on coins that could "only" grow another 100% this year, because they've already mooned. Quality coins are still good investments! #cryptocurrency #invest
9591 2018-01-03 13:38:23 @IQOption are you adding for crypto currency’s to your date abase to trade on
9592 2018-01-03 13:38:20 Claims to be a crypto investor and says scalability isn’t the number 1 issue?  everyone knows that’s the main problem with bitcoin. 7 txs per second? That’s trash. Why do you think ripple is number 2 rn? Because it’s fast. XRB is a faster and decentralized currency
9593 2018-01-03 13:38:19 Thanks Alex - I guess the huge jump in #PLUS customers yet more evidence of the Mania in Crypto.
9594 2018-01-03 13:38:02 Coinbase has a Huge advantage being one of the first, but crypto exchanges are still lacking in Big numbers and there is so much room for improvememt. Current crypto exchanges are really immuture. New exchanges which get it right from the start can take big market shares

Comment acheter la crypto : Stellar ? (XLM). Je souhaiterai en acheter contre de l'argent EURO.

merci pour le renseignement, pour le service je t'en offre une dizaine :)

9619 2018-01-03 13:35:50 People just need a more tangible and transparent investment policy, I don't even understand crypto a lot, let alone crypto currency. It has all the makings of good ponzi scheme.
9620 2018-01-03 13:35:44 anything is possible in the world of crypto
9621 2018-01-03 13:35:37 Most likely. He often typed in British English, and references a British financial event in a British newspaper! Seems pretty clear to me!
9622 2018-01-03 13:35:33 @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria @KevinRKelly_ #bitcoin is better than gold. Store of value that's secure, mobile, immutable, censorship resistant, deflationary, settlement mechanism for crypto, and more important than grandma :)

I'd like to add; get a separate device for trading only, don't use that for surfing or daily work. Install a paid(!) anti-virus program and nothing else.
9629 2018-01-03 13:34:41 They're taking everyone's TRX for arbitrage and blaming it on technical errors... selling high on their own exchange then buying it back cheaper on binance. Probably making millions.
9630 2018-01-03 13:34:32 Wrong, BTC dominance is down for various reasons, one because it hit 20k and it needs a rest, second because nobody wants to pay 20k for a technology that at this pont costs 20/30usd to move around, and because theres a lot of valid projects in crypto that also deserve attention

9670 2018-01-03 13:29:42 Well said Sir. Thank you for everything! 
9671 2018-01-03 13:29:27 Non of the sites you’ve promoted show Verge as an accepted crypto.. 
9672 2018-01-03 13:29:10 You must have been queasy for last 7yrs in crypto then. Unhealthy to feel constantly queasy
9673 2018-01-03 13:29:06 Hey guys. Lesson, just because the Twitter page has a pretty face woman with a nice rack. Does not mean she understands crypto. Might not even be a woman on the other side of the computer. SMH don't get played with these new tricks.
9674 2018-01-03 13:28:57 If you do this on @CNBCClosingBell , @DCBorthwick is your man. He called this move prior to the move, Best guy I know of on currencies & crypto-currencies.

9681 2018-01-03 13:28:17 how about reporting on some positive aspects of crypto. Like the humanitarian efforts of Bill Gates, and Factom?
9682 2018-01-03 13:28:10 There were other spikes also. Not only Ripple. The equilibrium is shifting. by June it will be a whole new atmosphere on crypto currencies. watch out XLM and ADA

2. Those needing traditional structures even though suffering from FOMO.

I'm also going for it.

9780 2018-01-03 13:20:23 Donc dans la liste des crypto-monnaies,  dont l'un des arguments de vente est de se passer de banque centrale, la plus performante est Ripple(XRP). Ripple donc, qui a plus de 30 banques comme partenaires. 2018 ne sera pas l'année de la fin de l'ironie ou du sarcasme.
9781 2018-01-03 13:20:09 I thought I would drop my 2 cents on some use cases of Verge and why Wraith is so important. You have heard of how many sites, medical and personal sites get hacked a year and people data exposed. #xvg $XVG $XRP $BTC $TOR $XLM

9792 2018-01-03 13:18:53 Bro, why you only looking at xrp? What about other coins? Are you trading those crypto's aswell?
9793 2018-01-03 13:18:52 Who cares its just another bastardised version of old world crypto. Staying right away from all that BTC BCH shit anything could happen next week.. For something supposedly decentralised its control by a select few is a worry.
9794 2018-01-03 13:18:49 First need to get card issuers to return to non-EU markets. That should happen in 2018.

9795 2018-01-03 13:18:49 J'ai lu l'article  et il ne parle pas de la techno, au mieux de projets de crypto avant gardistes. Quoi qu'il en soit, on se heurte à un problème d'adoption qui empêche la liquidité des cryptos en tant que devises et instruments de paiement.
9796 2018-01-03 13:18:45 Always have a plan. Plan for up and down, and an emergency plan for rare moves. Also, taking (some) profits at various levels isn't a bad idea.

9797 2018-01-03 13:18:31 Not arguing that the later is not self serving either, this doesn't serve to justify the former though. (look at McCaffee)

Crypto Twitter is truly a magical place but as you have pointed out, it's a slippery slope. Guess it's my own fault for expecting more from @ZeusZissou.

9809 2018-01-03 13:17:48 #ffwd there you have it 20p paid quality in this market is what it’s all about, #ECO also a quality share to keep an eye on this year, strong bod strong balance sheets with strong assets are key. Ppl are bored of been shafted by bent bod it’s either aim quality or crypto in 2018
9810 2018-01-03 13:17:42 Ok, so there are rumors that #xrp will be added to #coinbase. This is great news, but I suggest you invest a larger multiple into #trx. Xrp feasibly can run up 2x-3x, but trx can rocket 20x, just based on market cap alone. #crypto #Ripple #XRP #Tron #TRX #BTC #ETH
9811 2018-01-03 13:17:40 Same :)
9812 2018-01-03 13:17:37 If your detailed 'price analysis' of crypto extends to, 'it did X amount last month so if it only does (insert fraction here) of that this month then it'll moon' then you're a flat out idiot. $BTC $ETH $XRP $LTC
9813 2018-01-03 13:17:25 Great advice. I even have a separate laptop smh.

9832 2018-01-03 13:16:07 1- Bought some bitcoins. Fractions of them, actually
2- Participated in an ICO (i.e fundraising, in the crypto-game)

9835 2018-01-03 13:16:04 I wouldn't really mind. Your apps are some of the best out there; consistent, decent rewards and very rarely any tech issues. I'm sure whichever you choose I will get the app. BCH or maybe XRP (if Coinbase rumours are to believed) would be a great option. Keep up the good work.
9836 2018-01-03 13:15:54 do you have a telegram account?
9837 2018-01-03 13:15:43 How long have you been in crypto. If that was the case you wouldn’t be making money. The innovation comes from the push back against banks.
9838 2018-01-03 13:15:42 I didn't know crypto was so popular among doctors.
9839 2018-01-03 13:15:39 Sure anyone you know that is wise with lots of experience & insight for decades in Crypto Currencies? Will we need their net worth?

9846 2018-01-03 13:15:16 So here is my thinking when it comes to the $BTC vs #alts debate ... $BTC grew 13X last year so no doubt the #alts were battered...do you really think we're gonna see the same type of growth this year? I am thinking max 3X which would give us a 40-45k BTC by EOY. #crypto

9872 2018-01-03 13:13:00 Keybase is fully open source AFAIK and has the largest existing network effect amongst crypto people. But my point wasn't to integrate keybase but rather to replicate it. However a keybase integration could also be very good!
9873 2018-01-03 13:12:59 You are a broke crypto wannabe. You know nothing about the game and yet you are here defending an exchange that has nothing to do with you. I worked hard for my money and I don't like when it is taken for days on ends without my consent dumbo.

9894 2018-01-03 13:11:52 1/ It takes minutes to identify a 5-10% trade, repeat it X times daily and compound your gains. Works just fine with funny cash.
But it "works just fine" until your trading account is $1M+ and you can't enter any market you like at any price you want, anymore.

Ripple n'est ni en coté en bourse, ni même une crypto. Lorsque vous dites que Ripple a fait mieux que le bitcoin en 2017, vous auriez du dire XRP.

9942 2018-01-03 13:06:51 Ripple was below 14 when i wrote about it being the only crypto making sense and having real life usage, and its acceptance by many major banks.

As a token based communication and queuing system, not as a currency.

9949 2018-01-03 13:05:47 Sometimes it doesn't worth the risk to drive an old car.
And no, old cars aren't safer. You don't use old satoshi nodes to confirm your transactions, do you? New cars come with bug fixes ;)
9950 2018-01-03 13:05:40 Current price of #Bitcoin is $14628.02 $btc
9951 2018-01-03 13:05:37 That didn’t take long!
9952 2018-01-03 13:05:34 I understand Crypto Currency. #BiggestMisconceptionAboutMe
9953 2018-01-03 13:05:28 Probably a good shout, not the same but $GAS is about 35% value of $NEO right now. So i guess the price of $THOR end of 2018 depends on what we think $VEN will get too. I reckon $VEN $20+ so $THOR $5-$7? or am i way off 
9954 2018-01-03 13:05:24 The barriers to entry are still quite high. People need to do some learning about crypto/setting up wallets/security/key management etc. It also involves a new form of transfer. Add to that on-ramping problems then there are vast amounts of money yet to enter
9955 2018-01-03 13:05:20 @DougKolk have I got you into crypto yet?

9960 2018-01-03 13:04:56 Michael, you are a professor of crypto, nothing worry about studies. You will be best in exams also  good luck
9961 2018-01-03 13:04:47 In the future the term altcoin will be replaced; "What altcoins do you have?" will turn in to "Which bitcoins do you have?" when mass adoption happens. Bitcoin is the aspirin/bandaid/cellophane of the cryptospace. #bitcoin #btc #crypto #altcoin #altcoins

9970 2018-01-03 13:04:10 Very true, think most people are waiting cos they'll find it easier using debit than Crypto on binance
9971 2018-01-03 13:03:55 et quelle stratégie recommandes tu ?
Acheter et attendre sur le long terme ou faire des aller retour quotidiens ?

9974 2018-01-03 13:03:40 Every time I hear someone shorten “cryptocurrency” to “crypto”, I cringe. It’s painful listening to some of my podcasts now, people use the term all the time. It’s one of my biggest pet peeves right now, and I just can’t get over it.

9976 2018-01-03 13:03:35 My daughter has more money than me in the bank (I put it there) but now won’t touch it. Tight ass is buying crypto currency and just counting her profits and how much $$$ she has in the Bank and spends my money. 
9977 2018-01-03 13:03:34 This video has nothing to do with the ripple itself. Centra card supports withdrawals for all currencies, including BTC, ETH, LTC, ZCASH, XMR, XRP, DASH, and CTR.

9980 2018-01-03 13:02:42 Si tu rentre dans la Crypto-monnaies t’étonne pas d’être à -30% du jour au lendemains, tu ne perd rien tant que tu ne vend pas et n’écoute pas les médias 
9981 2018-01-03 13:02:35 Yeah, in totally pissed off it has risen so fast and far, as I wanted to buy a tonne more.  My only hope now is to get lucky on some volatile small caps and use profit to buy more ADA.
