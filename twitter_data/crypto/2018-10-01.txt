5 2018-10-01 23:59:26 I do t k is quite what you have against xrp but thinking it’s going nowhere now is just stupid it deffinatly has s use case as do other crypto assets so saying xrp will do nothing is like saying btc will go to 0 it’s just naive
6 2018-10-01 23:59:22 This one is probably well-known, but the time between the release of Bohemian Rhapsody and its crypto-viral revival from the Wayne's World movie is _much_less_ than the time between the Wayne's World movie and now.

10 2018-10-01 23:58:43 The whole point of Bitcoin was to decentralize power and allow everyone a free and open market with no interfering third parties. 

It absolutely kills a piece of me inside when I see people who actually pay taxes on crypto.

They can't tax what they don't know you own.

Stop it.
11 2018-10-01 23:58:43 Now I can log back in, you better believe I’ll be opening a support ticket ... that will likely be reviewed in late March.

18 2018-10-01 23:57:53 "High Probability, Low Risk" means that you have an entry that makes sense and an exit beyond a meaningful S/R level. You can still get stopped w/ high probability trades, esp. in a high volatility market like crypto.

"Low risk" never changes though, so that's good
