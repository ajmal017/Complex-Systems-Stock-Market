0 2018-04-24 23:59:57 @Wealthfront it would be nice to have an option to not invest in the oil industry. I guess I can simulate by manually adding a list of top market cap companies, but you clearly have the tech to avoid certain stocks. /cc @350
1 2018-04-24 23:59:57 Yeah, had to sit with cooking oil in my hair with it saran wrapped and that shit felt horrible
2 2018-04-24 23:59:49 The key to making a good ragout is sweating the onions in olive oil (sofrito) before you add tomatoes. Spice it up by deglazing the onions with a bit of red wine 
3 2018-04-24 23:59:46 Iran is so unsafe and has so much corruption that people are advised to put their cash in the Bank.
They don’t have chicken and eggs due to some BS bird flu.
So import the food with all the oil money.
4 2018-04-24 23:59:46 Then you should advocate that the oil industry in Canada be nationalized, just like it is in countries where the price of gas is very low. A litre of gas in Moscow is about $0.84 CDN.
5 2018-04-24 23:59:40 Ugh took my car in for an oil change and noticed when I picked it up it now has a crack in the windshield. Great

May the oil on your life increase and may your ministry be enlarged to touch even more lives. May grace abound to you and keep you steadfast.

11 2018-04-24 23:58:49 You have no idea how the global economy works.  When they came to the table before, China and Russia backed up, and the sanctions were complete. Thinking we're going to "Level" Russia on oil is a pipe dream (It is cheaper for EU to import oil from Russia than US)

43 2018-04-24 23:57:00 It’s pretty much the opening from Baseketball. 

“The Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles where there are no lakes. The Oilers moved to Tennessee where there is no oil. The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City where they don't allow music.”
44 2018-04-24 23:56:57 And the crazy thing is we know Iran won’t want a new nuke deal. So what Trump and GILF lover said today should’ve caused #OIL to go higher. Instead, it crashed like an asshole. #oott
45 2018-04-24 23:56:36 King Oil Can ...
46 2018-04-24 23:56:17 I’ve been suffering with migraines for so long and just now learned about using peppermint oil for relief .... wow #amazed
47 2018-04-24 23:56:10 I was even ready to buy #oil up to $70 today. 

Question I posited to clients today was: 

If the dollar bears are getting squeezed, when will the #oil bulls be squeezed? #oott  

Such extreme positioning will not go unnoticed.

53 2018-04-24 23:55:39 To be fair, most of them are middle aged or geriatrics. The good ship "Physical Beauty" has sailed for most of them and left behind an oil slick.
54 2018-04-24 23:55:27 45 also advocates for "taking the oil" in Iraq and making Syria reimburse us for our military help in their battle with ISIS. History clearly wasn't his strength in school.
55 2018-04-24 23:55:22 Yeah, like viral oil
56 2018-04-24 23:54:49 I can get behind going all green, first bring back the coal jobs, open more oil platforms and refineries.  Get us cut off from foreign fuels.  Then bring in the green jobs in to the areas like The Appalachian areas.  You can’t cold turkey over night.

58 2018-04-24 23:54:36 Venom was my first comic book ever. Without that i’d probably have grown up to be one of these weird frats dancing with oil sheen in their beards.
59 2018-04-24 23:54:36 Slashing military spending to boost roads, schools, communities... compared to spending billions to fund headchopping terrorists to help destabilize a country so their oil fields can be seized.

I know which one sounds better to me.
60 2018-04-24 23:54:27 @DonBraid @althiaraj - I was  surprised to see Don Braid agree with Jason Kenney but they both are wrong about the Liberal Party's resolution about oil and gas. Althia Raj is a responsible journalist who the facts straight.
61 2018-04-24 23:54:18 Check refinery open near Edmonton in late 2017.  Also, do research on partial upgrades and problem with shipping refined oil.

67 2018-04-24 23:53:03 Shut the power switch off to USA then we negotiate. No oil, hydro or natural gas until new deal for Canada.
68 2018-04-24 23:53:00 I don't have a vagina, but I do have a hole, and I had an issue with using coconut oil, it actually gave me a mild burning sensation.

I'm also pretty sure you were there for that, but my memory is shit

72 2018-04-24 23:52:10 There are some interesting differences between SK’s Bill 126 and AB’s Bill 12. My sense is that the SK Bill is a better drafted Bill and more likely to survive a constitutional challenge. 

That said, I doubt SK can specify to where oil & gas can & cannot be shipped.

77 2018-04-24 23:51:34 I wouldn’t recommend it but Vitamin E oil is much better as a natural lube but kinda expensive

79 2018-04-24 23:51:17 moisturiser acts like a barrier on your skin after you put it on! you’re best putting oil on first to get all the benefits then apply moisturiser

82 2018-04-24 23:50:22 Prediction:

An elite super-class emerges containing ~100-500 million Bitcoin-rich augmented cyborgs.

Hyperbitcoinization/rapid progress takes majority by surprise.  Unable to adapt to Anarcho-Capitalism/peak oil, the Competitive Exclusion Principle will result in a bloodbath.

84 2018-04-24 23:49:53 Inviting ISIS to talk about terrorism would be great, they could tell then who gives them money, weapons, who trains them, who helps with selling stolen oil. But it's not the point. The point is, freedom of speech is for humans, but not just anyone is human for a European.

93 2018-04-24 23:48:41 Oil is the most traded commodity in the world... almost all the countries economies would collapse if we decided to be serious about climate change... THAT'S why the propaganda is against it.
94 2018-04-24 23:48:16 There are certain combinations of ingredients that I'm not sure how real chefs use them without mopping grease off the food before it's served. E.g. italian sausage and cream. SO much oil on this spaghetti, and I already DRAINED it. #CookingWithYeen

117 2018-04-24 23:45:00 Meibomian gland dysfunction is the blockage or some other abnormality of the meibomian glands preventing them from secreting enough oil into the tears. Because the tears then evaporate quickly, MGD is a leading cause of dry eye disease.
118 2018-04-24 23:44:58 Okay thank you! It actually works great for my face, though I know a lot of people break out. After giving it a try as lube, I'm thinking it might not be so great for inside me, but so much online information was pro-coconut oil I wanted to see if anyone else had any issues.
119 2018-04-24 23:44:37 Curious Russia’s top exports are natural gas, coal & oil. Traded in  What happens if FinCEN RICO’s their assets? And those that aided their laundering money into tRUmp & GOP?

125 2018-04-24 23:43:50 Loopy Liberal change IMO comes to: the CPC(Harper) had good effective platform, leaving LPC with NOTHING. They had to invent problems: climate, racism, obligations to refugees, oil is bad, etc. Many moderate Muslims liked CPC. Islamists didn’t. So JT adopted Islamists.

130 2018-04-24 23:43:32 It’s all greed. They will eventually create their dream European super league with the 20 power houses all to suit oil pimps and manufacturing slave owners. The essence of the game doesn’t exist at the top any more.

139 2018-04-24 23:41:44 Why do I post lots of videos on oil and natural gas development? because - that is the REAL NEWS. Most of the fake news is designed to keep you busy, scare you, and get rid of your objections when U.S and others buy lots of unnecessary armaments - making the elites...rich.
140 2018-04-24 23:41:43 Of course not. Remember that Trudeau wants to phase out the oil sands. Why would he do anything to encourage development of Canadian energy?
141 2018-04-24 23:41:27 Have you seen the oil gore scene in x4? It's crazy.
142 2018-04-24 23:41:08 did both of those, also bought a gallon of ether at 10 to make diesel model airplane fuel. Mixed 30/70 mineral oil, also melted salt Peter and sugar with a torch in test tubes, tricky!, to make model rockets, dynamite fuse to light, you could buy that too.
143 2018-04-24 23:41:03 Not with the trump administration in charge. They’re planning on drilling for oil and mining for metals in the parks.

149 2018-04-24 23:40:00 Despite the sell-off today, oil prices are headed toward $70 a barrel --> prices last hit those levels back in 2014. For context, the price of Bitcoin back then was just $368. Today, after hitting a 6-week high, the cryptocurrency is selling at nearly $9,500.

225 2018-04-24 23:29:21 I've known about this for years but not the extent. My old neighbour put lots of wipes down the loo....I use very little oil for cooking but always use paper to get grease from pans or trays before washing. It doesn't take much to make a difference.
226 2018-04-24 23:29:18 Maybe if I put coconut oil on my debit card everything will be ok ?

286 2018-04-24 23:19:21 You may decide my observations are nonsensical that is your perogative.However I will continue.Organophosphates are added to high performance jet oil.I surmised with thatalong with vineyard agchems creating cluster and so did US Prof who kindly visited me while on holiday here.

289 2018-04-24 23:18:54 It should be noted that the USA became not dependent on Middle Eastern Oil during The Obama Administration.

292 2018-04-24 23:18:13 He's glistening from the oil on his face from like 12 hours of travel and no sleep, but it works for him hunty
293 2018-04-24 23:17:59 Firstly the UofA accepts large sums of money from the provincial government much of it derived directly or indirectly from the oil and gas industry. Suzuki campaigns to have the whole industry thrown out of work and the province beggared. It was a stupid decision.

297 2018-04-24 23:17:21 I absolutely LOVE CBD oil. It has honestly helped me in so many ways.
298 2018-04-24 23:17:15 They have the world over a barrel especially now that Trudeau is killing Canada's oil and gas industry. Sad Canada would rather import Middle Eastern oil than develop their industry.
299 2018-04-24 23:16:37 Coconut oil
300 2018-04-24 23:16:26 Still got this 8th blunt covered in blue dream oil, might face it tonight
301 2018-04-24 23:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but much else.
302 2018-04-24 23:15:53 I’m never in the sun long enough to burn just to be kissed but if ik I am girlllllllll sunscreen than coconut oil
303 2018-04-24 23:15:45 I rarely use oil but when I do its organic.  I grow or forage 80% of my own food.. I am 80% self suffiecient year round except the end of winter where its probably closer to 50%.  I dont eat meat dairy wheat only oats.  If Ihad your mushroom setup I'd be completely self suffciemt
304 2018-04-24 23:15:32 Ohhhh oil fields. That makes sense. I have a regular that buys me a few VIPs when he comes back to check on his house.
305 2018-04-24 23:15:21 The meaning arising from oil?
306 2018-04-24 23:15:10 he’s an oil worker from Texas & his wife is back home. he was like “if it’s a problem that you work here & I stay here, I can just stay at another hotel so we can go out” & then he gave me the pouty lips & said “pleassssse”
307 2018-04-24 23:15:06 Deadass  I barely get oil changes I just fill that boy up when it looks low 
308 2018-04-24 23:15:03 Oil doesn't generate much for the govt revenues.  It's a small part of govt revenues. It's a declining resource and revenue source. The 10bn fiscal transfer dwarfs it.
309 2018-04-24 23:15:01 Why are white people so fascinated by coconut oil
310 2018-04-24 23:14:56 Oil & Water, Light & Darkness, Gas & Fire...DON'T MIX! But CHURCH & the WORLD?  Lord help us!!

327 2018-04-24 23:12:22 WHAT??? Oh my I can see we need to fix you some Okra! 

You don't have to fry it, slice in small pieces and put on a cookie sheet, olive oil, spices and parmesan, cook till fairly crispy but not burnt. Serve with another vegetable and your favorite grilled meat.

332 2018-04-24 23:11:28 The only solution is to stop funding all these atrocities in the Middle East. The oil return is not worth our dignity as a country.
333 2018-04-24 23:11:12 Such a cautionary tale for us.  We're forgetting why we fought for independence.  This is a reminder.

341 2018-04-24 23:10:02 @mikephelan22 would make you laugh nonstop, treat like a gentleman, and if you're nice to him he lets you play with his beard (he uses unicorn beard oil)
342 2018-04-24 23:10:02 Are you really surprised? The 1st peoples were moved to the ‘crappiest’ lands so the farmers and miners could have land/riches, now those ‘crappy’ lands have the oil & no surprise, govt wants, nothing but greed drives this 
343 2018-04-24 23:09:49 Could you try mineral oil?  They make grape and cherry flavors.  Also you could minty snacks.  That might help

349 2018-04-24 23:09:02 @Macey__Skelton “I’m gonna go pour olive oil into a new bottle...” okay.... 
350 2018-04-24 23:09:00 Technology is transforming the path oil and gas travels from extraction to end consumer, and more change is on the way. BDO illustrates innovations in the upstream, midstream, and
downstream energy sectors in our latest insight. Visualize the new journey for oil & gas.

361 2018-04-24 23:07:45 Pacifica brand makes some gr9 products and they don’t have any harmful filler ingredients in them. Make sure to moisturize well even if you’re oily so it keeps the excess oil down! A cheap way to fight pimples get charcoal pills and get the powder out
362 2018-04-24 23:07:42 They design and merchandise the store like a casino. They purposely want you to get lost and continue to spend your money. You’re better off staying away.

373 2018-04-24 23:06:26 Hahaha, do they really want to be down there with the alligators & year round bugs? I should think they would demand someplace like Texas where there are oil fields.Then again, there's alot of munitions in TX,so that wouldn't go over well.I say be happy with what you have now.

391 2018-04-24 23:03:57 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
392 2018-04-24 23:03:51 Well you never pissed me off if that was your end game. I just shake my heads at people like yourself.  Force is not power.  Logic and reason is not controlled by the oil companies.  Protecting the environment is honorable, destroying it is not. #StopKM

394 2018-04-24 23:03:41 I did not say that you had to eat animals in order to benefit from livestock. They fill a much more important role than that. So does oil and gas. We just have to lean how to use them.

462 2018-04-24 22:55:54 Leigh Anne, I don't mean I believe that. Quite the opposite is the case. But the facts on the ground in Europe (remember Charlie Gard?) all point in this direction, and it's horrible.

But make no mistake: this is just 1 consequence of big government.

467 2018-04-24 22:55:03 Also many people fail to consider is the CO2 used to: extract oil (eg Alberta), ship it to a refinery (e.g. Texas) and ship the gasoline to service station. Then you have to drive to get your fuel. With electricity, the fuel (ie energy) goes from the source directly to the user.

Go after offshore $ #VanRE tax evaders, but locals can't afford more taxes: #carbontax, higher gas prices due to no local refineries & buying oil from the US instead of AB. Locals need tax cuts to survive

584 2018-04-24 22:37:34 Yup. Essential oil nya juga beli disitu. 
585 2018-04-24 22:37:27 Try some Thieves Oil in an essential oil diffuser and as a hand sanitizer (rub some under your nose, too). That stuff kills damn near everything. A full dropper of Liquid Vitamin D in your morning coffee, and eating a spoonful of coconut oil should help too. Feel better soon.
586 2018-04-24 22:37:19 Do you mix the coconut oil with your moisturizer or you apply it as it is?
587 2018-04-24 22:37:01 Random Thought: Anyone who willingly ingests the foulness that is castor oil and does so with a smile is of Satan and is NEVER to be trusted!

588 2018-04-24 22:36:55 Next time you’re in Mankato, swing through @MankatoMotors and I’ll make sure you don’t hear anything like that while waiting for an oil change. Sorry for some people’s choices!

592 2018-04-24 22:36:39 Is that god in every religion ??? Aaaanyways this is a great way to distract from the Iran deal, putins oil prices are gonna soar sky high
593 2018-04-24 22:36:34 These buildings were used in Dallas as the Ewing Oil Building
594 2018-04-24 22:36:25 I hear what you are saying but the problems didn’t start with Justin - think NEP, Air Canada maintenance to Montreal, sky high tariffs to protect Eastern manufacturers, “phase out the oil industry”, Bombardier and my always favourite “equalization”
595 2018-04-24 22:35:53 CBD Oil from Select is back in! We have three flavors with a range of 850-950mg of CBD per bottle! Only $60, no tax!
596 2018-04-24 22:35:47 Everything I cook has these three secret ingredients:
1. All the vegetables ever
2. 8 cloves of garlic
3. Black pepper
4. A drop of toasted sesame oil
597 2018-04-24 22:35:35 They want to destroy oil and gas in the state. The west slope wants them all in Boulder to go back to California
598 2018-04-24 22:35:29 Sounds like you believe Suzuki speaks the 'truth'??? Suzuki wants to kill Canadian oil and gas jobs. He doesn't have any issues with the Saudis?
599 2018-04-24 22:35:27 Well oil be damned nation
600 2018-04-24 22:35:26 In 150 have Republicans ever shown any sign of moving away from an oil and war economy?

603 2018-04-24 22:35:03 Pegging the value of our currency with a commodity such as oil which is plentiful and worldwide forces us to be petrol policemen of the world and it is too expensive just like the Roman Empire experience when their empire got too big
604 2018-04-24 22:35:00 The tings that spill out of my mouth are like an oil spill. Yet it’s not oil, just shame and regret. #ijustsaidthat

606 2018-04-24 22:34:26 Fast forward to Kadafi and Libya. He was introducing a gold dinar as an alternative way to pay for oil period a short time later he had a bullet hole in the middle of his head
607 2018-04-24 22:34:13 It’s not bullying it’s simple truth. Oil & gas has funded much of the UofA. Better the university knows what’s at stake than to simply have funds disappear.  Dr Suzuki would have Alberta cap every well.  I wonder if he’s started pedalling his bike to get here yet?
608 2018-04-24 22:33:57 What should the EPA use in place of science ? Norse mythology or just whatever oil CEO’s tell them?
609 2018-04-24 22:33:48 There were a lot of reasons given to us about Saddam Hussein n overthrowing this country and his regime. But an interesting thing is that the French stock market agreed to list Iraqi oil for euros instead of US Dollars 48 hours after they listed that oil in Euros we bombed Iraq
610 2018-04-24 22:33:47 Top 11 doctors in the world;

615 2018-04-24 22:33:16 I agree, Kamala, and here's why: Assault weapons' legs are WONDERFUL deep-fried in petrolium oil and dipped in anti-freeze! Delish!
616 2018-04-24 22:33:06 Scatter fresh orange and lemon peels or spray with citrus-scented fragrances. Coffee grounds, vinegar, pipe tobacco, or oil of lavender, lemongrass, citronella, or eucalyptus also deter cats. Plant the herb rue or sprinkle dried rue over the garden.
617 2018-04-24 22:33:03 Yes the problem they have with Iran is that it’s one of the only countries standing up to imperialism ...Iran avoids selling oil using the dollar ..there is no McDonald’s, texaco and large American Corp in Iran ..like the majority of the world ..
618 2018-04-24 22:32:57 Essential oil friends... any oil blends you can recommend to help ease Shingles discomfort? I wish I was asking for a friend...

662 2018-04-24 22:26:34 Correct when you count unrefined oil.  Around 15 days diesel.  We are importing plenty of fuel as refineries have closed.  No merchant navy of our own.

666 2018-04-24 22:25:14 With today's price of oil you wouldn't think it would make any sense to build a pipeline

672 2018-04-24 22:24:20 Mobil products and look at your oil cap for the correct weight
673 2018-04-24 22:24:19 Yes, 1973, when they voted for EEC ( not EU).  3 day week, oil crisis I remember.  Arabs stopped selling to countries supporting Israel. They would have agreed to anything then.  All these years beguiling.
674 2018-04-24 22:24:17 Look, it's not rocket surgery, knock a few oil company heads together, put some seed money in, and build a refinery (what: around $10-$15 billion)!? And, you might get the Alberta and BC governments to pitch in.
675 2018-04-24 22:24:14 Isi gini? Na person wey help you marry wife go follow you dip plantain inside oil?
676 2018-04-24 22:24:12 They didn't just seize the oil. The reason they're at the bottom of the Heritage Foundation's list is because they seized private property "for the people!"

This is what tanked their economy. They seize businesses' property and the businesses stop investing in the country.
677 2018-04-24 22:23:52 Unfortunately, for some sufferers of mental illness, pharmacological treatments are insufficient, or undesirable for other reasons (e.g., pregnancy). And some of the snake oil treatments aren't harmful (e.g., exercise & eat blueberries) or weakly supported by studies.

680 2018-04-24 22:23:40 Thanks! That batch turned red within a day. It was an air leak in the shortpath system. Distillation under high temps caused it to go red before too. Leaving the alcohol in the sun prior to distillation also caused red oil for me in the past.
681 2018-04-24 22:23:28 Avedas cooling oil works wonders
682 2018-04-24 22:23:23 Good point Bill. The oil industry has no interest in helping Canadians become self sufficient in their oil consumption.
683 2018-04-24 22:23:15 Well... not all of us want to! Some of us are pretty disgusted. It's about the complex intersection between oil and the military/industrial complex - and about the fact that the US spends such an obscene amount of money on defence that they've got to be seen using their toys.

692 2018-04-24 22:20:45 Movies always show women applying lipgloss or lipstick right before seeing someone they're into so they feel cute but just once I would love if a woman took out a Clean & Clear oil absorbing sheet and made her t-zone less shiny. That's content I can relate to!!!
693 2018-04-24 22:20:43 this and using oil treatment and/or deep conditioning more frequently! cheap option is warm olive or coconut oil just massaged down to the roots n left on as long as u can. i use a product called arrojo whipped treatment that’s good...also shea moisture hair milk
694 2018-04-24 22:20:22 Offshore tanker oil should have import tax/tariff!

701 2018-04-24 22:19:13 Russia won't allow this. Against their National Interest.. This is all about getting a new oil & gas pipeline running through Syria to service Europe. Currently, Russia has the only pipeline. The Saudis want a new one, that Assad rejected. This is why they want to remove Assad.

706 2018-04-24 22:18:17 "Snake oil salesmen"?  Only last night a bloke up the pub asked me where can you buy some snake oil when you need some? Living down south isn't quite the high life people think it is.
707 2018-04-24 22:17:21 I'm crying. My heart is broken for them.
708 2018-04-24 22:17:20 New users that dont smoke are going to buy oil, just look at the states. Oil is where the margin come from. Good luck with you tho, I think you are just trying to create arguments not a conversation. Have a nice day.
709 2018-04-24 22:17:07 So the women can't wrestle, wwe may be getting paid in blood oil money, the winner gets nothing but a trophy, and this might be the show that they put Reigns over. Just wow
710 2018-04-24 22:16:57 I was just behind a Tesla and its license plate said “lol oil”
711 2018-04-24 22:16:45 You helped her get like an oil change or something.
712 2018-04-24 22:16:27 You have to use bronzer. I always say would you lay out in the sun without tanning oil? No. So why lay in the tanning bed without bronzer lol it’s the same thing
713 2018-04-24 22:16:16 I’m pretty sure I could get my oil changed for free if I just go get the oil, filter, bring an oil pan and act like I’m going to change it myself in the Walmart parking lot.. wait for some dude in a pickup to come by and say “you need some help?” Yesssiirrrr I do 
714 2018-04-24 22:16:11 Your boobs look amazing covered in oil.  Looks a lot of fun

718 2018-04-24 22:15:35 Oh it's ways of working out the soreness that Cat has from running.  Although, it does sound like ingredients for dressing for a salad.  I would recommend a massage instead of black pepper oil.  Massage works wonders!  Have a blessed day everyone.

720 2018-04-24 22:15:31 Well...it’s officially official. The #ndp and #liberals have ruined our province. Our #fuel prices are higher here than in the east coast. We don’t even have hst. Maybe we should just import foreign oil too. #trudeau doesn’t tax it so it’s cheaper.
721 2018-04-24 22:15:29 Electric buses are impacting the oil industry via @technology
722 2018-04-24 22:15:22 I use olive oil sautéed them in a pan till a tad golden brown then I pop them in the oven at 350 for 30 minute and they are perfect! Some of my friends use a cast iron skillet. I hate raw cauliflower but roast them like my Brussels and I will eat them all!
723 2018-04-24 22:15:17 Good luck.
724 2018-04-24 22:14:59 I've emailed you twice about the CBD oil.  Are they going in your spam?  Jeff
725 2018-04-24 22:14:52 You know it's finals week when I wash my car, get my oil changed, vacuum out my car, clean my room, do laundry, refill my washer fluid, and go grocery shopping. #finalsweek #whatlawschool #procrastinationnation
726 2018-04-24 22:14:25 Bernie couldn’t guarantee anything. What a fraud. @BernieSanders the fraud   His lies are like a sham artist selling snake oil. He is delusional. Your party hasn’t a clue on bringing jobs nor how their paid. Scam artist
727 2018-04-24 22:14:05 Is there a hell where the most pleasant breeze resembles the breath of a snake; where the new leaves of tree are red hot coals, moon is like fiery Sun, night is like the night of the death, beds of lotuses are like spears planted on the ground; rain is like hot oil pouring +
728 2018-04-24 22:13:53 An expansion machine does the rest. The worker blots up excess oil from the skin. A fifth lacquering head paints a black stripe.
729 2018-04-24 22:13:49 Oxidation likely, I've seen instances of THC clear with thick syrup like consistency when a large bubble lingered then popped a red ring formed around the circumference similar to the hue of the oil you have here.
730 2018-04-24 22:13:49 wearing a new white shirt to work.  of course i spill indian curry on it. which includes turmeric and oil.  my fault.
731 2018-04-24 22:13:28 Like car washes, oil changes, and brakes . Stuff like that
732 2018-04-24 22:13:02 I let it sit there for a moment, practically tasting the moisture in the air mixed with the crude oil and exhaust from the city.
733 2018-04-24 22:13:01 ...looks up "death panels"...

736 2018-04-24 22:12:34 Tea tree oil is truly a gift from Mother Earth like it gets my skin together like no other
737 2018-04-24 22:12:31 You also need to include the oil, which they sold 552K ml. You should then ask TWEED why they can produce triple of that capacity but only sell 2000 kg per quarter.
738 2018-04-24 22:12:08 After work I went to get my nails done but they said it was a one hour wait. I turned around, walked out and came to get a much needed oil change. Am I an adult yet?
739 2018-04-24 22:11:30 I've got this idea for a soup: red onion and diced chorizo simmered in coconut oil, then green peppers, mangetout and string beans (need using up) blitzed and blended, with some yogurt that also needs using up thrown in there too. What do you reckon?
740 2018-04-24 22:11:04 For me, 6 qts of oil cost about the same as someone doing it for you . Ets why
741 2018-04-24 22:11:02 In Nov I blew an engine in flight on my twin.  The entire bill all said and done was eye watering... Now have a zero time IO-540  Lycoming Factory Reman, new turbos, turbo controller,  overhauled prop, governor etc as all parts saw metal chips in the oil.
742 2018-04-24 22:10:58 Let’s see how this Cbd oil makes my moods 
743 2018-04-24 22:10:54 Relax na. She your Bambam made 25 million from selling 5,000 units of Bam beauty oil yesterday, at this rate within 1 month she'd be swimming in hundreds of millions of naira.

747 2018-04-24 22:10:33 Sorry, don’t know.
748 2018-04-24 22:10:25 I think that works for people who are working in the oil industry, but at what cost?  You grew up in the KSA, which I think is amazing, and would love to hear more, but you can't deny that much wealth has squandered and sold away for influence at the expense of Saudi citizens.
749 2018-04-24 22:10:19 What do you do with leftover oil?
750 2018-04-24 22:10:07 Endless oil story

754 2018-04-24 22:09:40 All of u on this posts that wanna know the cost price should be aware she cannot spend 10million naira in producing 5000 bottles of carrot seed oil. Since u wanna know her profit she will make over 15million as profit. And if the product is not directly hers she gets her %
755 2018-04-24 22:09:39 The Impala wild talking bout service vehicle soon. Lol I just got an oil change
756 2018-04-24 22:09:36 Y'all know there's a place in tioga does oil changes for 20$ and are really good ppl!
757 2018-04-24 22:09:31 I just realized I got the engine oil changed and forget the leftover at the shop which I'll need in the morning. Great.
758 2018-04-24 22:09:31 Wear gloves no matter what dye you use and do a coconut oil (or any oil that’s good for your hair) soak the day before like maybe a leave in conditioner thing but try to get your hair as healthy as possible first
759 2018-04-24 22:09:28 Baba Yaga, the doors, on their hinges; there in the birch tree said, "Long as I've served you, you've never poured oil on
760 2018-04-24 22:09:17 Not Ironbark, no. They will last for decades as is. We have other hard woods that don’t last as long. Be interested to know how/if other people treat their strainers. Does good old sump oil do anything?
761 2018-04-24 22:09:17 Well, raising oil prices is top of the To Do list, after that we’ll see*

767 2018-04-24 22:08:25 Like bombing afrin and the kurds calling them terrorists while arming and buying oil from da3esh?
768 2018-04-24 22:08:22 5) Replace Some of Your Cooking Fats With Coconut Oil
-Coconut oil is one of the healthiest fats you can eat.
-Studies show that the medium-chain fats in coconut oil may boost metabolism and decrease the amount of fat you store in response to high calorie intake
769 2018-04-24 22:08:10 Because you have to take into account that pep spent a small fortune with that oil money and so did other clubs. It was always going to be difficult this season playing away from the lane. so many factors
770 2018-04-24 22:07:58 My whole house smells like eucalyptus oil  fuck y'all thought this was...I'm not playing with that pollen shit anymore. I saw an allergist 3 years ago to get treatments and this is my first time getting sick since then.

I'm also hoping to have a GD review before the end of April. Infinity War on Sat too!
779 2018-04-24 22:07:16 Says the man bought and paid for by Trump, oil, coal gas and auto industry.   Sigh....
780 2018-04-24 22:07:13 I grew up in KSA. I worked in the oil industry for years after that. The US developed existing resources and paid the people who owned the resources for those resources.
781 2018-04-24 22:06:57 If it was profitable to ship oil all around the planet for possibly 30% more, not including shipping and handling...you’d be doing that already. Now, with the added political costs...it’s not going to happen! #bcpoli #cdnpoli
782 2018-04-24 22:06:53 3) Avoid Foods That Contain Trans Fats
-Trans fats are created by pumping hydrogen into unsaturated fats such as soybean oil.
-They're found in some margarinesand spreads, and they're also added to some packaged foods.
783 2018-04-24 22:06:52 Same shit with Nicki and Safaree. People swear he wrote her raps...meanwhile he selling coconut oil on Love and Hip Hop

786 2018-04-24 22:06:31 I love my 05 Corolla. 279,000 miles. At 220k, it quit using oil. That's right, almost a quarter million miles and the engine just got broke in.
787 2018-04-24 22:06:29 i’ve used tea tree oil before but it didn’t do much for me :(( i definitely do need to drink more water though i’m always dehydrated sjsjsj

789 2018-04-24 22:06:19 So now leagues will just quit paying USBC dues and not be sanctioned....not like you get awards anymore anyways.....you want to put the skill set back in the bowlers hands how about enforcing oil patterns and make "house shots" a little harder
790 2018-04-24 22:06:11 We are there for Israel and the new Arab world alliance. Iran (non Arab) will be the biggest loser sometime in the future. Russia will have wasted precious $ and time. Ultimately, Rus only cares about having a high cost of oil & being able to influence that market in their favor.
791 2018-04-24 22:06:08 موفقين
792 2018-04-24 22:05:59 Under Trump, the US military is now a mercenary force for SA, UAE, Qatar,  Trump says we support you if you buy so much arms, provide cheaper oil, invest $billions here, or outright pay the cost. Is the US military ok with it?
793 2018-04-24 22:05:27 Then they drilled for oil and all was well . The whole world enslaved .

797 2018-04-24 22:04:44 Don’t know had to look it up. It’s a Persian plant spices. The fresh earthy and woody aroma of this oil brings pleasure to both the mind and soul. The chief constituents of Galbanum Essential Oil are cadinene, cadinol, myrcene, and pinene. Who know we Libra have a scent to us.

801 2018-04-24 22:04:10 Easy big fella with your poison talk. I don't hear you complaining about the billions in transfer payments made to Ontario as a direct result of the oil sold to China and the US.
802 2018-04-24 22:04:04 They preorded, they have not even paid for it yet. Basically they just showed interest by dropping phone numbers in the dm.
Maybe when they see the oil, we will know
803 2018-04-24 22:03:53 雨やん
804 2018-04-24 22:03:45 Well I haven’t been there since last year but the cream they gave me did help, I just switch up the things I’m using bc my skin gets used to them after so long. I bought an oil too that’s been helping with the redness and scaring it’s called bio oil.

813 2018-04-24 22:02:22 Just spent over 30 minutes (which I will never get back) watching a programme about #fatbergs 
Who the frig puts cooking oil down the toilet /drain/sink? It is beyond me!

815 2018-04-24 22:02:14 Thursday price changes. All numbers are in: Heating and stove oil to increase by 2.1 cents a litre. Diesel shows an added 2.2 cents a litre. Gasoline to increase by 3.8 cents a litre. Middle East concerns continue...#gaspricesnl #oilprices
816 2018-04-24 22:02:10 Health Insurance stocks, which must ALWAYS hold until our GREAT AMERICAN GREATNESS as run for allowing oil
817 2018-04-24 22:02:01 i feel a BREEZE on my EYES when i put tea tree oil on my face
818 2018-04-24 22:01:59 I’m proud of u , you got an oil change  this is your year
819 2018-04-24 22:01:42 You’re very transparent when you backpedal. Volcanoes are beyond human control. Do you plan to plug a volcano to allow more human pollution? You can’t? Then it’s irrelevant! A few bad actors means we should join them? You’re like Rush Limbaugh after the BP oil spill! Absurd!
820 2018-04-24 22:01:37 Yall I put too much essential oil in my diffuser and my house is smelling straight up like an old lady.
821 2018-04-24 22:01:25 Actually, I think they liked Rex better, a Hero of Russia for inking Exxon oil deals to develop Russian Arctic oil fields, but sanctions got in the way, and he also called Trump a moron. Pompeo is definitely second choice.
822 2018-04-24 22:01:16 Where exactly did I say hemp oil was dangerous? I just wouldn't use it. That's all I said.
823 2018-04-24 22:01:15 hot oil splashed on my hand and I can't even bare the pain .

827 2018-04-24 22:01:13 It’s his ulterior motives that are worrisome & that he has no intention of listening to logic.

Distraction from tRumps criminal behaviour 

tRump just plain ignorant
828 2018-04-24 22:01:13 @Flora Hi, noticing how difficult it is to find a dairy free spread that doesn’t contain palm oil, & would be absolutely loyal to a brand that didn’t include it as would many other vegans! Have you considered this?
829 2018-04-24 22:01:12 Pastor Osinbajo is no lone white danshiki wearer, he's proudly a palm oil seller.
He lies. 
Is divisive.
Is manipulative.

Walks late into functions and rudely distorts proceedings (including in church!)

Increases in usage of cleaner burning natural gas are leading the improvement. Private Enterprise not idiot Government is the answer.
832 2018-04-24 22:00:58 What stinks is the gas we are paying for today was oil that was purchased by the gas companies to refine 6 months ago at a MUCH lower rate...

847 2018-04-24 21:58:31 Worst part. If that was my boy: Half of me would want to be there until the end, the other half would end up in jail for what I'd do.
848 2018-04-24 21:58:29 Not sure if I should use this oil right now 
849 2018-04-24 21:58:16 i have no idea what it is but my mom used this essential oil or something on her hair in the shower and now the whole upstairs smells wonderful

855 2018-04-24 21:57:56 Breaking the Iran Deal would impose sanctions on Iran again and prevent them exporting oil. This reduction in supply will drive oil prices up. Are people actually surprised that the Trump administration are keen to do this??
856 2018-04-24 21:57:55 @nosoyyo7 Oil update: After experimenting with various impractical changes, I decided that the only reasonable solution is to give up on fried rice. So I'm back to curries with potato or plain rice supplemented with a small stock of canned soup.

864 2018-04-24 21:56:48 I can’t name a time where coconut oil has done me wrong 
865 2018-04-24 21:56:14 The will now be a flurry of activity over the next three weeks by the EU to try to show some progress on some additional sanctions or "new deal” on #Iran.  We doubt it will be enough for Trump to waive #oil sanctions again. #OOTT
866 2018-04-24 21:56:10 The main problem is Suzuki’s condescension towards engineering, economics and pretty much any higher education that requires math. The tree-hugger vs oil country thing wouldn’t be an issue if he wasn’t such an ass.
867 2018-04-24 21:55:58 Your hotel makes standard adjustments for guests that may include Muslim oil sheikhs and gay celebs. That gives you no idea how today's SJW's promote a dangerous globalistic agenda.

•Grapes must be

•Diamonds form

•Olives are pressed to

•Seeds grow in

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation.

906 2018-04-24 21:50:16 i think that's very important to understand. an oil spill that size is a point-of-no-return-situation. preparedness goes beyond clean up - it starts with the planning of the well.

909 2018-04-24 21:49:58 "INSANE": Some are interpreting Trump’s comments today as perhaps reconsidering Iran #oil sanctions in May but our view is unchanged. Moreover, Trump used some of his harshest language ever about #IranNuclearDeal calling it “terrible” and “insane” and “ridiculous.”

912 2018-04-24 21:49:50 Unpopular opinion: WSPA members have a potentially important role in the future of California energy. But not if they just want to be left alone. Oil companies are innovative engineering firms. CA needs that to 2030. But they need to climb out of their foxholes for that to work.
913 2018-04-24 21:49:30 #Russia was allowed to pump a secret solution which may contain toxic waste into American geologic structures to extract oil and gas. This was approved by the US government and has impacted aspects of US ground water aquifers.

Just kidding about the Russia part.

919 2018-04-24 21:48:40 3) Avoid Foods That Contain Trans Fats

-Trans fats are created by pumping hydrogen into unsaturated fats such as soybean oil.

-They're found in some margarinesand spreads, and they're also added to some packaged foods.
920 2018-04-24 21:48:39 Forbes response was bang on, that wasn’t the place to start shooting down the many false facts spewed out by Sukuki.  I’m honestly curious what seems to be your confusion on Oil Sands innovation?

933 2018-04-24 21:46:54 And can you explain WHY, after the huge tax break to the OIL companies, that GAS PRICES ARE INCREASING AT A RIDICULOUS RATE?  Why? Didn’t they just get BILLIONS in breaks. So let’s take what Little May be in a pay check and put it in the tank and in the hands of OIL cos!!

958 2018-04-24 21:43:25 to be fair, I personally wouldn't do it either, even if my channel was large enough to do it. I personally wouldn't use hemp oil and my policy on sponsorships is that if I wouldn't use it, I'm not advertising it.

962 2018-04-24 21:42:50 There is a big question on where the money for these big infrastructure plans will come from. Yes, the oil price is at $75 per barrel, but that's not $120-130 where it was before the latest crisis.
963 2018-04-24 21:42:40 Why would anyone want to work with cultures that have it ingrained in their spiritual background to be antisemitic? What do they have to offer, apart from oil?
964 2018-04-24 21:42:38 Trump on #Iran restarting nuclear program: "If they restart it, they’re going to have big problems, bigger than they have ever had before. And you can mark it down.”

969 2018-04-24 21:42:11 @MarleyNatural Hey All, I went to LA today and actually looked up every reseller. Only CBD and Oil was to be found at more than 8 listed distributors. 2 said “People don’t buy it because it varies and the oil is harsh due to the wick.” I struck out 100%. Have 2 try OC tomorrow.

973 2018-04-24 21:41:54 Last week, at the bidding of the oil and gas industry, the Trump Administration took the first step in opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. 

This is another dangerous mistake that the Trump Administration considers a “win.”

1001 2018-04-24 21:38:18 Well I did make something with peanut butter, coconut oil and coconut. They were okay. Are you talking add some chocolate? I could possibly just dip what i've made for extra flavor.

1044 2018-04-24 21:32:09 Even as a lover of well conducted observational studies, I have to say that I found many of the points to be straw man arguments. Sure RCTs need to be better, but they are our biggest defence against oil interventions and we need more, not fewer
1045 2018-04-24 21:31:58 The sheer irony behind neo-Stalinist support for Putin is that the oligarchs launder nearly all of their money in the West, send their children to school and vacation here, and are often tied to the oil industry, which relies on dollar earnings.
1046 2018-04-24 21:31:46 I can’t stop thinking about Mary and how she worshiped the Lord Jesus and anointed him with oil Jesus had raised her brother Lazarus from the dead and wept with her Jesus was her friend and she listened to him and He always defended her when people misunderstood her She inspires!

1050 2018-04-24 21:31:29 I guess all this are happening because the youth rely on oil and therefore are lazy and uneducated.

1056 2018-04-24 21:30:56 Please Mention. The money the US returned to Iran as part of the deal was their money. It was money from oil sales to India held in escrow due to sanctions because it went through a New York bank. Had to be in cash because same sanctions don't allow Iran to use banking system
1057 2018-04-24 21:30:46 QUESTION OF THE DAY LET'S SEE IF U CAN ANSWER IT.
WHAT DO U HAVE TO PUT IN OIL TO MAKE IT BOIL?...

1080 2018-04-24 21:28:12 The evidence bears out your professor's belief .... recently Iraq 1 & 2 for oil - Afghanistan for rare earth minerals AND the Caspian Sea oil pipeline - Iran's conflicts also for oil - tRump would love to attach them and that would truly be our demise
1081 2018-04-24 21:28:11 coconut oil is the best thing everrrr
1082 2018-04-24 21:28:10 As Russia, with a GDP only slightly larger than LA County, considers its oil resource a vital national interest, it makes perfect sense they would vandalize emerging threats any way they can.

1087 2018-04-24 21:27:45 it was putting blood in a robot and sending the resulting numbers to doctors but it was a hell of a lot better than feeding people tea tree oil and watching them die
1088 2018-04-24 21:27:39 So what is the current weight of scientific opinion on fish oil?
1089 2018-04-24 21:27:38 There’s no evidence to support that claim. It’s not about that. Hillary Clinton supported the Saudis commit genocide in Yemen and ignored Burma’s. It was about stealing oil

1092 2018-04-24 21:27:04 Iran dropped the us dollar, so of course the US will back out of the Iran deal and guess what fake war we will soon be entering......it's all about oil, money and the petro dollar
1093 2018-04-24 21:26:58 My daily pain levels are between 5-7 on a 1-10 scale, CBD oil in syrup form usually brings it down to 2-3. I was planning on getting a tincture soon to try. But I’ve found CBD vape to be very helpful with my anxiety when I use it. I can notice a big difference between w/ and w/o

1098 2018-04-24 21:26:26 The "realities of now"... more than 60% of the natural resources of the U.S. lie under beautifully preserved Rez borders which only amount for 1/3 of U.S. land mass. Remember that when you notice U.S. oil topping Russian and Saudi Arabian oil. Settlers squandered the rest: FACT.

1121 2018-04-24 21:23:25 The best treatment for back pain I've found is magnesium oil and movement. Magnesium oil got me off codeine. My pain includes muscle spasm, stiff spine joints and mild arthritis consistent with my age. Would never be without magnesium oil. Life changing for me.
1122 2018-04-24 21:23:18 gotta mix in a tiny bit of heavy cream or grass fed butter. absolutely amazing. I like my coffee black always so I just used the oil but yeah lol.
1123 2018-04-24 21:23:06 thing is: at that point with the horizon spill things were already beyond repair. had all that effort been put on the cleanup been put on safe drilling procedure...

once the oil is in the water, the damage is done either way.
1124 2018-04-24 21:22:56 Look inward where? Do you really know Osun state? Osun is not like Lagos or any oil producing state.Most are civil servants and business owners. You want govt to over tax them to raise money. For years Osun was the last on the list of FG monthly allocations. Look inward where?
1125 2018-04-24 21:22:54 I used black seed oil at home tho cause it smells strong but I use dapper beard oil when i go out
1126 2018-04-24 21:22:50 Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo failed to disclose his business’ ties to a Chinese government oil & gas company as required for his confirmation to be CIA Director! Now he is set to be confirmed as this country's chief foreign affairs adviser. #Trumplandia

1128 2018-04-24 21:22:49 Now you sound like Judis complaining about the costly oil that was used on Jesus.
1129 2018-04-24 21:22:11 ... ,the extremely Super Rich Leaders of those wealthy oil barren lands! I don’t want you to misunderstand what I meant when I said I’m Blessed to have been born here, I feel so very sorry for the one’s in these 3rd world countries that are filled with war,....
1130 2018-04-24 21:22:03 Got a free oil change today! 
1131 2018-04-24 21:21:54 Thing to factor in is modern generation (younger than 45) put EVERYTHING in toilets: scrunched cigarettes/cardboard pill boxes, huge dirty disposable nappies/sanitary towels, cotton buds, cigarettes etc. Down the sinks go hot used cooking fat & oil that solidifies into solid fat
1132 2018-04-24 21:21:52 Also what happens when we was our plates and the grease and oil that comes off stuff even if you put the bulk in the bin some still gonna end up in. I think sewers can't cope with the waste but agree if wet wipes were not flushed the oil would probably flow away.
1133 2018-04-24 21:21:51 Halve. Toss w/mix of olive oil, Sriracha, & maple syrup. Bake at 325° for 20-30 min.
1134 2018-04-24 21:21:34 What if no oil & fat was flushed down drains - maybe you’re making wipes a scapegoat?
1135 2018-04-24 21:21:03 Translation: Cambridge Analytica used pestering tactics and had to be told many times to fuck off before they realised they'd been rumbled as snake oil purveyors right from the word go by the SNP rep.
1136 2018-04-24 21:20:44 So we need to keep bombing innocent women and children in order to protect our access to their oil? No thanks! #NoNecons #NoMoreWar #NoWarsForOil #Peace #HandsOffSyria
1137 2018-04-24 21:19:40 I dropped a ton on a beard trim and product for it and got myself a nice lunch today. Tomorrow I get a haircut finally and an oil change that’s long overdue. Wow I am an adult
1138 2018-04-24 21:19:11 I've noticed them going up where I live and work for about a year now. Oil Companies gouging prices because they know they can get away with it. Because 45 is (cough, cough) president.
1139 2018-04-24 21:19:10 DEV GOT A MOROCCAN OIL CAMPAIGN I’M SO PROUD
1140 2018-04-24 21:19:09 If a significant percentage of that is olive trees — Spain the largest olive oil producer in the world — maybe less impressive?
1141 2018-04-24 21:19:06 Maaaaaybe if they asked questions about things Americans cared about then the WH wouldn’t treat them like little bitches.... just sayin....

1147 2018-04-24 21:18:18 What? Hahaa who had problems then? Was there problem withe Russian's bank accounts? Or did United suddenly become a small club! Or did liverpool suddenly lost their history. Or maybe The oil fiasco hit City?
1148 2018-04-24 21:18:11 Where do you think is the origin of politicizing a scientific study? How do you not see the massive profit gains the oil companies get by muddying the waters? You wanna talk about a deep state, the oil companies paying into politics has long been the dark market of politics.
1149 2018-04-24 21:18:08 Lol...IKR! Esp when that hot oil is bent on locating extreme spots like above your lids 
1150 2018-04-24 21:18:05 I actually prefer light-weight long cotton pants in the summer (or salwar!) to shorts. If you don’t, still treat shoes and socks and use DEET or picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin. Specific recs are in post
1151 2018-04-24 21:18:03 Great question ... bare in mind Iran switching to EU for oil trading
1152 2018-04-24 21:18:02 If a oil and a space both owned a cent, would they put a account in it?

1156 2018-04-24 21:17:44 vsu cfa is so nasty ! it’s like they been cookin the nuggets in the same oil for months .
1157 2018-04-24 21:17:41 Secret science, you mean science that doesn’t agree with your friends in the oil, gas, mining, and other pollution making industries right Doit?
1158 2018-04-24 21:17:36 Barnett first then Holyrood. Several big oil pipes running directly from Shetland to London as well
1159 2018-04-24 21:17:35 Dude I know just learned meth pipes are sold “legit” as “oil burners”....or as he thinks...to smoke essential oils from 
1160 2018-04-24 21:17:31 Oil rich oil companies are ripping us off at the gas  pumps. Our tax break money now is being stolen by them. So much for being self sufficient with gas. Being sold again for higher prices to other countries???
1161 2018-04-24 21:17:24 Facts! Atleast know how to change tires, oil, air filters

Oh aye erhm a don’t use sunflower, only olive oil please
1163 2018-04-24 21:17:11 Just in case you don’t know, one of Netherlands’ largest exported goods is oil. Plus, you don’t see Saudis interfering in other countries affairs, again, we focus on our country. One last thing, it’s our money, we’ll do whatever we want with it, stop envying. Still not a brother.
1164 2018-04-24 21:17:10 30%-50% of all Putins revenues come not from taxes, but from Oil/Gas Production & Exports.

The last thing in the world Putin would want is a US President who wants to unleash US Oil & Gas production, like Trump.

They want US to focus on wind & algae instead... like Dems. 
1165 2018-04-24 21:16:50 
1166 2018-04-24 21:16:46 My god comparing a league where there is a Russian Mafia and Qatar oil to a league where the 2nd best club has been Napoli who only have passion! Really? I'm disappointed. Never arguing with you again.
1167 2018-04-24 21:16:43 My brother-in-law is slowly die-ing from complications of Agent Orange....his daughter had to order cannibas oil from Canada because he knew how bad the opiods were.....It is bad enough he got shot-up from friendly fire...Now he has to go through back-channels to help himself.
1168 2018-04-24 21:16:13 Yes.  I was just making  a little play on words.  I'm not sure they ever figured out which did more damage in the Gulf--the oil itself or the corexit.  I'll check.
1169 2018-04-24 21:16:11 I’m glad I walked around the trees at our house with red palm oil because this storm is....bah
1170 2018-04-24 21:15:57 US oil production give Western Europe an option on energy supply. Putin had a strangle hold on energy in Europe. Expanding US oil and gas production helps our country economically and gives Europe a welcome option to Russia. Keep the valves open and flowing. MAGA!
1171 2018-04-24 21:15:57 Woman Loses Respect Earned Since Last Person On Signature Line Of Education Study By The Oil In Bag That
1172 2018-04-24 21:15:51 Indeed. AIM is full of those type. Very difficult to pick a good oil stock i think. But best rewards in oil/gas and other commodities.
1173 2018-04-24 21:15:47 Gun Oil has been the best lube I’ve used.
1174 2018-04-24 21:15:43 Perhaps the promoters are just tired of fulfilling the rider consisting of baby oil, bow ties, and magnums. 
1175 2018-04-24 21:15:37 All don't forget to register vote, and let us ban alcohol, marijuana and tobacco!  We should send the ballots to the over seas people working on the boats, oil drillers to get their votes too!  I believe we should let the world vote!  Alcohol, tobacco and marijuana effects all!
1176 2018-04-24 21:15:25 A secret that needs to be shared. 
1177 2018-04-24 21:15:13 Plus, Houthis in Yemen backed by Iran have pushed to the Saudi border. They need Saudi Arabia to push the ideological pipeline further. Russia plays a big role. Saudis have been getting off of the oil tit. Natural gas is the new gold. That’s why Russia has so much power.
1178 2018-04-24 21:14:55 Looks like CBD is the new fish oil.
1179 2018-04-24 21:14:48 I was told that #bambam sold 5000pieces of her oil today at #5000 and I believe Ceecee can do better with her ceecee bitter lol
1180 2018-04-24 21:14:45 I thought $120 was so much money when I was young. Now it’s just an oil change
1181 2018-04-24 21:14:43 Never ending stock available, where from ???
1182 2018-04-24 21:14:38 Almond oil
1183 2018-04-24 21:14:33 when their milking cow is still feeding them cheap oil (Saudis) why would they show their crimes....pathetic evils.
1184 2018-04-24 21:14:32 Jojoba, or rosehip oil slathered on - wait 3 minutes and then warm a damp towel in the microwave and steam your face and gently scrub. Then rinse with cool water. I just increased my retin A % and have been flaking lately. Eat some avocados if you can.
1185 2018-04-24 21:14:30 Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
1186 2018-04-24 21:14:20 Fish oil capsules are an extract. CBD Isolate is single molecule and will be considered pharmaceutical grade medicine regulated by the FDA.  GW is even trying to prevent natural extracts from being sold legally in other states. Colorado was smart enough to make the distinction.
1187 2018-04-24 21:14:09 The clue is in the time it’s taking & the performances of the companies they represented
1188 2018-04-24 21:14:09 who would i be without sesame oil
1189 2018-04-24 21:13:55 man i love sesame oil
1190 2018-04-24 21:13:38 Over a guy who compared the oil sands industry to the slave trade? Paula, come on.
1191 2018-04-24 21:13:16 Today it is oil, tomorrow it may be coal or diamonds or uranium. I am comfortable with the 50% derivation but I know as sure as night precedes day many will kick against it. What is important is that the majority find it acceptable & that’s democracy
1192 2018-04-24 21:13:07 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1193 2018-04-24 21:12:43 Nope.
1194 2018-04-24 21:12:23 Everyone is different... it’s better to give em all try if you can ... if you dissolve these all slowly... they work really well... tomorrow I’ll use cannabutter instead of oil infused. Switching keeps them popping 
1195 2018-04-24 21:12:20 The contract aims to set a buy-side oil benchmark & to allow producers to both hedge in Yuan & guarantee credit of independent 'teapot' refiner buyers. Backed by >800m barrel SPR China is well placed to conduct a Buyer's Strike to clear the market at $45/bbl or less

1197 2018-04-24 21:12:17 Cmon now. There are two pathways to oil. One biotic the other abiotic. While I agree the scarcity issue is part of control, it is Nonsense like this gives us all a bad name.

1206 2018-04-24 21:10:46 I for one am shocked. Shocked I tell you! Shocked that Hannity is a shady POS. I expect more out of my snake oil salesman!
1207 2018-04-24 21:10:42 I went to 3 oil changes places to not get shit done  I’m exhausted and annoyed 
1208 2018-04-24 21:10:36 Cannot believe I have just sat riveted for an hour watching  a programme about a fat burger autopsy! Disgusting and preventable it also exposed scary pathogen findings!another ecological disaster created by mindless flushing of wet wipes, vegetable oil & other unmentionables

1211 2018-04-24 21:10:06 Personally, I do not understand that attraction of really fat bums. I’m no oil painting myself so I wouldn’t criticise anyone’s appearance, I just don’t find them attractive. There’s some sort of marketing con going on here.

1218 2018-04-24 21:09:21 Simple way to think about things. Depending on generation source, every kWh saved has tangible savings in terms of public health costs and ecological impacts. Coal in Nova Scotia, heavy oil in Newfoundland. Avg. cost would look much better if we accounted for those externalities.
1219 2018-04-24 21:09:05 And your team is irrelevant without oil money

1228 2018-04-24 21:07:57 Just watched the fatberg thing on c4. I mean the fact some people ‘wash chicken’/put cooking oil down the sink/flush sanitary products/wet wipes/condoms etc when it’s obvs that’s not a good idea makes me  then

1237 2018-04-24 21:07:33 True. Oil consumption will be pushed down due to renewables and so has the stock prices of the majors. “Earnings have started to come through but no one believes it’s sustainable,” Kevin Holt of Invesco Ltd. in Houston told Bloomberg.
1238 2018-04-24 21:07:28 why can't canada just refine our own oil? instead of pipeline and shipping over seas??
1239 2018-04-24 21:07:21 So I may have started using CBD oil last night

1247 2018-04-24 21:06:12 But it’s the oil and fat being poured down the drains by restaurants that is causing the problem. Without that wet wipes would flush freely. You seem to have missed the point.

1249 2018-04-24 21:05:55 Agreed, overall deflationary backdrop. Demand pull inflation vs cost push is a critical distinction, though. Consider oil. Will next big drop in GDP or crude growth come first? Dearth of exploration, barring new tech or depression, will require a /CL spike to fund new supply, no?
1250 2018-04-24 21:05:51 These weren't even wrapped up! He chomped some on a lavender oil homemade one, and I forget the scent of the other one, but it wasn't mass-produced either. So, hopefully less chemicals. Luckily he didn't eat very much.

1259 2018-04-24 21:04:45 Ghee and olive oil are so expensive. Jesus be some food stamps
1260 2018-04-24 21:04:38 I either keep the original bottle and throw it away in there, or put it in an empty milk bottle or coke can or something. Better to miss a couple of plastic bottles being recycled than put all that oil down the drain.
1261 2018-04-24 21:04:37 I gotta snort an entire bottle of CBD oil holy shit 
1262 2018-04-24 21:04:33 I think you're supposed to put cooled oil from deep fat fryer in plastic container and take to your local tip for disposal #FatbergAutopsy
1263 2018-04-24 21:04:28 This should not be treated any differently than fish oil capsules. There is pharmaceutical grade available through a doctor’s prescription paid for by insurance and there are many OTC products that are the same thing.

1269 2018-04-24 21:02:52 The only thing we we've been after is oil. We have plenty of it stateside. Don't know why we don't just invest in our own economy instead of perpetuating conflict on foreign shores.
1270 2018-04-24 21:02:47 And I'm really not trying to single out Hen for this, the same goes true for any advocate, of Israel or Hadassah hospital or the oil industry or puppies. It doesn't mean they're necessarily lying, but I'm immediately suspect of the sincerity of their arguments.

1277 2018-04-24 21:02:06 Yep, mostly cooking oil.
1278 2018-04-24 21:01:59 Please stop rounding them up & sending them to slaughter. Why cant you see that they are historic and they belong on their home ranges. Why are you doing this? Is it because you want to steal their land to help ranchers and oil cronies? NO OVERPOPULATION! You know it.
1279 2018-04-24 21:01:53 How should we dispose of cooking oil? Wipe plates n cookware n put in bin - ok. But oil from deep frying? #FatbergAutopsy @thameswater

1300 2018-04-24 21:00:07 French troops now entering in the oil rich area of #Syria, seems the plan all along was to partition Syria & steal the oil, ISIS were just a smoke screen. #Macron is still #Rothschild's puppet.

1308 2018-04-24 20:58:58 You're shooting yourself in the foot, but I guess you will just cry to the government for more money when all you funding from oil and gas industries dries up
1309 2018-04-24 20:58:41 I got a Briggs and Stratton with the tank full of oil, washed it out with the proper fuel and it started up and worked for ages. Currently been setting idle for 2 years, will let you know how it starts this summer :)

1326 2018-04-24 20:57:23 ANZAC Day is anti-war. It's about WWI, not the glorifying of professional killers who died fighting America's wars for oil since. ANZAC is not a day for pride, but remorse and recrimination against warmongers. #auspol #ANZACday

1329 2018-04-24 20:56:52 It’s a spicy pork sausage that works incredibly well on pizza. It sort of half melts and can you get little dollops of rich spicy sausage and chilli and oil.

1331 2018-04-24 20:56:43 Moroccan food and I are no longer in agreement...unfortunately my tastebuds overrule my stomach so I am residing myself to a rather uncomfortable last couple of days. I don't know if it's the oil, the sugar or the sheer quantity of food though, that's my main problem! 
1332 2018-04-24 20:56:40 Nothing is worse than preheating your oven, only to come back to cook your pizza and find out some fuckhead left a pot of oil chillin in there.
1333 2018-04-24 20:56:30 Techically you could cover water with oil since oil floats on water.
1334 2018-04-24 20:56:08 good evening .you was writing some comments about India and black sea sfo oil market but you have stopped recently .hope you will come back again .
1335 2018-04-24 20:56:08 politicians take money from arms dealers and oil companies, who in turn write the legislation and enable policies for bombs and planes to be bought and used to secure resources. the economy gets fucked, everyone blames the democrats or immigrants or whatever, rinse and repeat.

1345 2018-04-24 20:55:04 True but you are mixing issues. Yes UK colonialism was evil, but it was primarily driven by trade not religious zeal. Plus UK has moved on.

1352 2018-04-24 20:54:22 No. Surprised oil sold off during macron and trump press briefing. Saying we want a new deal and having Iran agree to it are two very different things.
1353 2018-04-24 20:54:10 disabilities or not, go shingle a roof in a texas summer and tell me how hard being a stay at home parent is. Go work an oil field and say that! I'd trade changing diapers and constant babysitting for many of the jobs I've had to do.

1355 2018-04-24 20:54:02 I need to drink my stress away. My oil pan= 1 whole margarita  to find the power steering leak= 1 tequila shot                                 The two wheel bearings= a EXTRA DIRTY MARTINI to finish my stress levels off. Im broke and have no money to fix what I need to work with.
1356 2018-04-24 20:53:49 Oh BTW the flight next to the can wasn’t the worst of it, I had a baby with a bad nugget in its pants right next to me and the Mum let if fester for the whole flight. I grabbed some peppermint oil from my bag and dipped it on the stash for relief... pucker my lips and sniff.

1360 2018-04-24 20:53:02 Strengthens nothing. EPA does not stand for Coal and Oil Lobby.
1361 2018-04-24 20:52:58 I know that God has you in the right spot and the oil is gushing to be pulled out. I just can't wait for the confirmation so the stock price soars.
1362 2018-04-24 20:52:48 @thameswater just watching @fatburgautopsy, i used to fit pumps in sewers when i was young so i know about the problems fat cause's, would it be viable for u to have a oil collection service for your worst areas???
1363 2018-04-24 20:52:48 We all got tax cuts. Utility bills going down too, also, we’ll be the worlds leading producer of oil in less than 5 years. Also see: Saudi Arabia, they’re living in the dawn of a new age.  People minds are being liberated everywhere! It’s surreal.
1364 2018-04-24 20:52:46 Ok but could you try making your cookie dough ice cream without coconut oil? I wanna enjoy your ice cream 
1365 2018-04-24 20:52:32 We've come a long way from whaling for lamp oil as a species; maybe we have a chance, maybe we don't.
1366 2018-04-24 20:52:13 In my opinion,  with the industry being consumed by shady wooks,  tweakers & backstabbing teams,   the best goal would be a cannabis related product that doesn’t involve the actual flowers or oil...like packaging or a niche product that stoners want but isnt federally illegal

1372 2018-04-24 20:51:29 Trump’s behavior with Macron is an international embarrassment. It made me gag. Wonder what Putin’s motive is for having Trump behave this way. Is Iranian oil the end game? #PutinPawn #TrumpCon
1373 2018-04-24 20:51:25 It depends. If you take those stupid weight loss tablets, quite a lot. But the fatberg is cooking oil, no? I've recorded it for watching another time.

Clearly your dealership knows nothing about engineering. Motor replaced but major parts not.
1382 2018-04-24 20:50:20 lmao this is my first time going to get an oil change w my new car and I just

1383 2018-04-24 20:50:05 It's called blackmail Scott. Hard to believe a federal government would seek to punish provinces that won't win him any seats.

1385 2018-04-24 20:49:59 So, we are told that our sewers are full of nasties and 90% of the fatberg is veg oil, fuelled by our love of eating out. 

Surely it's fuelled by restaurants  & homes lazily chucking oil straight down the drain.  #FatbergAutopsy

1390 2018-04-24 20:49:28 "Thanks for connecting. I am active in the Oil & Gas sector and a politician from Libya, I am looking at a possible collaboration as i'm currently interested to invest in your company or any lucrative investment opportunity and business concept." #Jackpot

1392 2018-04-24 20:49:16 I had a dizzy spell in the kitchen and almost fell onto a fryer vat full of oil so guess who gets to go home early !!
1393 2018-04-24 20:49:09 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
1394 2018-04-24 20:48:56 Yam and oil is bae 
1395 2018-04-24 20:48:52 Hence UK suck crude oil from Biafra lands, use Housa Fulanis to slaughter Biafrans & Christians & arm terrorists, they don't care
1396 2018-04-24 20:48:48 Did you know baby oil is not made from babies
1397 2018-04-24 20:48:38 Tried to forcefully westernize the country after oil was discovered there. Porn and alcohol....is that what life js all about? The people have the right to preserve their way of life their values and traditions.
1398 2018-04-24 20:48:36 That's massage oil cause she gives me them lol

1403 2018-04-24 20:48:09 Or that time they raided vape stores for selling CBD oil?
1404 2018-04-24 20:47:51 Why does the current BC govt think we are incapable of managing oil tanker traffic just as well, as or better than, anyone else in the world? Is there a govt anywhere that shows such a lack of confidence in the people it governs?
1405 2018-04-24 20:47:49 Let the baby oil glo up then
1406 2018-04-24 20:47:35 Need a oil change

1409 2018-04-24 20:46:53 On my way...massage table and oil in hand
1410 2018-04-24 20:46:43 It’s still a looong way to go but I read from somewhere total US reserve is enough to produce oil for 36 years based on the same amount of reserve.
1411 2018-04-24 20:46:33 That coconut oil got my hair juicy 
1412 2018-04-24 20:46:30 Wales have just agreed to the Brexit agreement.  Powers, such as health will be handed to WM. They will be able to privatise the service so that after 7 years when it's handed back there is no powers to control

Like Scotland's oil, they will have been sold to the highest bidder.
1413 2018-04-24 20:46:29 Would they work with warm oil?
1414 2018-04-24 20:46:22 #CarloMarxBot: "Granite in Moloch! Oil in Moloch! Dial-up and concrete in Moloch!" wrote it first, man. Stop stealing!
1415 2018-04-24 20:46:21 The FED has no reason to refrain from hiking if inflationary pressures do materialize. With oil and the commodity complex running hot on sanctions, demand, and trade war it will push production prices up and inflation will overshoot. Job market is strong, assets are high. Hike.
1416 2018-04-24 20:46:14 How about the right of the other millions of people who support It and current system of governance. You understand the only reason Iran is in the news is so they can protect the petrodollar and control the oil supply. If they cared about the human rights they wouldn't have.....
1417 2018-04-24 20:46:13 Liverpool and the last 20 minutes of a game are like water and oil
1418 2018-04-24 20:46:06 They were probably conducting their own form of industrial espionage, swiping design ideas and figuring out how they could make the items not only by hand, but of much higher quality.
1419 2018-04-24 20:45:42 Woo, busy week and a couple more lined up xD 
Today I'm working on changing the oil in the lawn mowers, going to help Kit with his Honda XL350 motorcycle, carb still needs adjusted. Need to do some more work on #ProjectCuckoo
1420 2018-04-24 20:45:35 BTW the oil numbers are API, not EIA.  Tomorrow at 10:30AM eastern is the real thing.
1421 2018-04-24 20:45:25 I say that in response, the oil companies should stop providing their products to Boulder. There, problem solved.
1422 2018-04-24 20:45:22 Did you use baby oil?  I’ve been wanting to try that
1423 2018-04-24 20:45:19 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1424 2018-04-24 20:45:12 They blow the rear wing with exhaust gases  ftrom the waste gate & use special engine mappings to produce extra gases to blow more ( AMuS explained). The oil burning is speculation they always lose fliuds during racing so they let off something on the trackm some unknown flluids
1425 2018-04-24 20:45:05 No one to blame but yourself for higher oil prices. Perhaps if you tossed fossil fuel cronies and allied with progressive leaders, you’d be in better political position to maintain higher fuel economy standards, promote renewable energy policies, invest in EV infrastructure, etc.
1426 2018-04-24 20:45:04 Do you prefer burning the midnight oil, or debugging when the sun's out?
1427 2018-04-24 20:44:56 The greatest thing George H.W. Bush gave me was salvation from a life lived as a brainwashed conservative. Voted for him, and then he sent me to make war against enemies that were undermining his oil business interests. Yet...I still respect him as a human being as well as POTUS.
1428 2018-04-24 20:44:27 The fish oil/n3 trials of late have me really wishing we randomized folks to achieve a certain blood level over prescribing a fixed dose. Would love to see actual dose response data instead of population mean shifts.
1429 2018-04-24 20:44:19 Was just a site visit, look over a few oil platforms for an up coming job.
1430 2018-04-24 20:44:13 Sinclair Oil Standard Oil...
1431 2018-04-24 20:44:10 Ahhh...no, just Friday. Gotta be in Macon Saturday to be the Pit Reporter for the DirtonDirt PPV of the Lucas Oil race
1432 2018-04-24 20:44:06 Witch hunt!  Can’t a guy waste taxpayer money, take bribes from lobbyists and be in bed with big oil anymore without the Libtards losing their minds?
1433 2018-04-24 20:44:04 Yo MCM takes his car to the shop for an oil change
1434 2018-04-24 20:44:01 Eucalyptus oil 
1435 2018-04-24 20:43:54 Reasoning for the rise is rubbish. The US is exporting oil to European countries. The world does not need Iran oil.  Try again with the real reason, if you know
1436 2018-04-24 20:43:46 Take revenue allocation for example. Population, derivation & land mass are factored in the formula, otherwise oil producing states will take all, or representation in National Assembly where equality of states & population form basis otherwise more populous states will take all
1437 2018-04-24 20:43:35 Yes they can. What about electricity? People use it al the time but know nothing of it. Refining oil? 
The point is infinity & eternity is beyond our understanding but we know they're there

1445 2018-04-24 20:42:31 Thank you for proving my point.  Venezuela is in the mess it's in because of a lack of economic diversification, falling oil prices, dictatorship, etc; and, not because Venezuela has given jobs to ppl
1446 2018-04-24 20:42:23 A tax on oil is a tax on all of us. They are shoving this down our throats like they shoved all this tolerance crap on us. Hello Butthead? I'm supposed to respect the same fruity McFly I used to beat up? It's time we shoved something down their throats for a change! 
1447 2018-04-24 20:42:07  you and God mix like oil and water.

1452 2018-04-24 20:41:35 oh crap, that'd mean 4 oil changes twice a year, or every year if you bought the high-zoot oil

1456 2018-04-24 20:40:59 As for causes of CC - respectfully, if your on the fence now it's because you haven't been watching.

1463 2018-04-24 20:40:12 Therefore, if Venezuela has relied on one industry at the expense of others, it's GDP should be weak, as the graph I included shows.  If you want to talk about price of oil, fine, we can do that, but don't conflate the fuckin issues. That's what you neoliberal, conservatives do

1476 2018-04-24 20:39:16 We're not talking about price of oil.We're talking about diversification and how Venezuela has relied on one industry and that brought about the mess it's in.  GDP is a measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period.

1482 2018-04-24 20:38:31 The good news: there is growing concern amongst oil executives about divestment.

The fossil fuel industry can see that rapid decline is coming.

1484 2018-04-24 20:38:26 Oklahoma needs to DIVERSIFY its economy, not become more reliant on one industry - oil and gas.

Higher taxes isn't the answer.

No unfair tax breaks for some.
Gov't shouldn't pick winners & losers.

1486 2018-04-24 20:38:21 I'm Swedish mate, we've not been in a war since Napoleon. Sure I completely disagree with most Nato actions in the middle east but this was clearly not an oil grab, they struck ISIS they were helping Assad in doing this, it's beneficial, it shortens the civil war.
1487 2018-04-24 20:38:15 Hang on... It's not 100% sourced as in the #CHAR #placing. Could B  hydrocarbon shows, gas etc but it's better to know than not  etc.. Where there's gas there's usually oil. Hopefully  X

1494 2018-04-24 20:37:45 My CBD channel is suspended as of now, no explanation and no reason behind it, its freaking CBD oil. Appeal was denied, waiting for my termination email next... #its2018cmonYoutube
1495 2018-04-24 20:37:40 That wouldn't be bullish you idiot. So much hoopla about "OMG inventories lowering!" and what not, yet even with product draws you get a crude build. Lower refinery inputs and HIGHER US oil production here we come. Get ready ultra bulls. Go ahead and wish for 80-100.
1496 2018-04-24 20:37:40 Oh yes it’s all about the sale of arms & of course oil.
1497 2018-04-24 20:37:39 It's G4S. Once upon a time I worked in oil refineries and would run into those clowns at the main gate and I would pronounce their name G Forces.  Freemasonic G=33

1533 2018-04-24 20:34:40 Nice, at this time of the year is the reffinery update, normal for the Gasoline draw and the crude build
1534 2018-04-24 20:34:38 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr HA! API Build! It must be low exports and high US oil production along with a lot lower refinery input than expected. Now we wait for tomorrow's fall :)
1535 2018-04-24 20:34:32 Michaels, I used to get my dram vials there. I believe some people store gun oil in theirs.
1536 2018-04-24 20:34:28 Fb keeps showing me ads for Valvoline coupons. It must know I'm overdue for my oil change. 
1537 2018-04-24 20:34:16 Pennsylvania: 
Gas is reaching $3 a gallon, with the highest taxes in the nation blaming this on rising crud oil prices is ludicrous!
1538 2018-04-24 20:34:16 I've been meaning to congratulate @IcelandFoods on their steps to save the environment. First to stop using palm oil in their products (because even "sustainable" palm oil still results in rain forest destruction -- pay attention @marksandspencer), & now reducing plastics -bravo!
1539 2018-04-24 20:34:15 The AR15 & big box of ammo (which I’ve never fired) the oil lamps I never use and the canned food that I need  to replace.
1540 2018-04-24 20:34:15 anyone who uses facebook to store files for presentations also probably drinks oil
1541 2018-04-24 20:34:08 I'm talking about revenue, if you can't fill the stadium which you can't. Proven many times this season, fans buy merchandise which is revenue. Oil money is all you have.
1542 2018-04-24 20:34:06 His comp is his business. Conflict of interest more concerning. When head of WWF Canada Butts said oil sands should be left in the ground. Does WWF hold same position now? Is Mr. Butts' spouse still a WWF exec? Asked Mr. B same ?. No response yet.
1543 2018-04-24 20:34:06 I us a face mask 2/3 times a week and a facial scrub twice a week, I use micellar water (oil based) to remove my makeup and a very good mild facial soap

One of the reasons why #US #Oil rally could have last for so long and gone so high was mainly due to the pumping by those pundits calling $100 oil. #Trump has sent shockwaves since last Friday to bring down high #crude prices to survive the low approval rating.

1566 2018-04-24 20:31:09 Pay more at  pump  U.S crude oil fell 1% to $66.70 after @realDonaldTrump said U.S could withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal. I wonder what liberal Honorable @tedlieu  about this 
1567 2018-04-24 20:30:55 Turpin, a plant biologist, is recently from UVic where he was also President. I submit that he is biased to the oil and gas industry and favours people like his feloow BC'er and biologist Suzuki. The U of A is out of touch with Alberta and its citizens. #ableg #abpoli

1570 2018-04-24 20:30:49 I would rather this idea but it’s been in place in some forms already. Just want things tightened a bit more so I can bring my kid to the ocean and lakes without all of them being poisoned with heavy metals, plastic and oil/coal accidents. Cheers

1580 2018-04-24 20:30:11 If someone was hoping to build a bridge between Oil & Gas and environmentalists, and saw conferring an honorary degree on Suzuki as a way of doing that, they totally underestimated the lengths some Albertans will go to to play the victim. #ableg #abpoli

1586 2018-04-24 20:29:38 I really don't understand it because they say it's to do with the new oil rules but they were brought in to stop them burning oil as fuel by reducing how much they're allowed to use. Surely if it's disappearing out the back they must be lacking the amount needed?
1587 2018-04-24 20:29:36 That's up there with that genius that asked where'd we have got the money for an oil fund.  Findlay I think.

1592 2018-04-24 20:28:52 That's fascinating! Reduction of oil demand will surely change world dynamics in the future.

1663 2018-04-24 20:20:04 This goes back way farther than bush, dude. Middle Eastern intervention from the US dates back to at least the 50s when we overthrew Mossadegh and started crushing oil worker strikes in Saudi Arabia

1666 2018-04-24 20:19:56 Why is he such a moron???  First we got ISIS.  We got Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Then we got a bunch of oil.  Then we got a good deal with Iran that prevents them from making a bomb for 10 years.  The second you let that deal expire,  that 10 goes to 0.

Good alternative? Make a parfait of unsweetened yogurt (2 - 5% Turkish or Greek),  topped with ginger jam and flaked almonds. 

Or vanilla ice cream with extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, orange zest

1813 2018-04-24 20:03:06 everyone swears by coconut oil on the lashes but I got a damn milia when I used that method lmao
1814 2018-04-24 20:02:52 Yes! You will never get tired of seeing them. Years later we still holler 'Hummingbird at the feeder!'  Also, wasps may gather and scare away the hummers. I use vaseline or olive oil smeared around the openings. It doesn't bother the birds and the bugs hate it.
1815 2018-04-24 20:02:51 Never really cared enough about that show to worry about how to spell the characters names, another tactic of lefties, not oil spelling, giving a look of ignorance to the perp.
1816 2018-04-24 20:02:45 Please raise taxes James. Get the Government to make it better using more of my money. Think of the money Govt might have had available to it if the Gummit encouraged industry, like oil exports.
1817 2018-04-24 20:02:41 If any ladies out there are having similar issues or even if not, I highly highly highly recommend the goddess detox pearls, and progressence plus essential oil by young living! Changed my life.
1818 2018-04-24 20:02:41 Ask your self this- Is it the best play on the board?...what is your time frame?...have you looked at oil, gold,silver, agricultural commodities...lots of commodities look attractive for a run.

1821 2018-04-24 20:02:11 I am cooking lunch and out of olive oil. had a moment of panic, but then I remembered butter exists.

1823 2018-04-24 20:02:06 For absolutely no reason.

1856 2018-04-24 19:59:02 I’ve been having this conversation for the last five years, still no change. I’m sure all industries are the same but it’s been really bad in the oil industry. So many talented folks out of work! One local company who started here refused to hire anyone with an oil background!
1857 2018-04-24 19:58:59 Just like coconut oil, I am also:

• organic
• virgin
• unrefined
• bottled in a facility that also processes peanuts
1858 2018-04-24 19:58:59 How crazy would it be if we found out it was the oil industry who funded all these people saying going vegan would make an even bigger impact on the environment than driving electric cars??

1864 2018-04-24 19:58:31 If the scratches aren’t to deep. Clean with thinners 1st, then use Osmo Polyx oil satin or gloss. It will add a depth to the wood & hide the imperfections.  wax will flatten it & poss show up the scratches  @TessaJaneDesign #UpcycledHour

It has fault lines in it, too, which is neat.
1867 2018-04-24 19:58:10 I arrived at @chevrolet @ 2:15 for an oil change and I was told my car would be ready in an hour. It’s now 4:00 (almost 2 hours later) and I’m still waiting. My oil change should be free right?

1885 2018-04-24 19:55:46 I have a 96 Camry I use for a beater just for work, 220k miles and runs like its brand new. Drips so much oil I have to put in a quart every 3 weeks but everything still works in it

1899 2018-04-24 19:53:49 will they share the same pool of collateral/maker holders? or would they be distinct systems? also, could this system be used to create tokens which represent commodities, i.e barrel-of-oil tokens?

1911 2018-04-24 19:52:20 Macrons actiions can be seen as part of a long term plan to destabalise Russia. All that Russian oil and gas is what drives every move. Do French people approve of this? #EmmanuelMacron #Syria
1912 2018-04-24 19:52:00 That’s what I’m seeing as well. Whipsaw incoming. But to what degree? Dxy and long bonds selling off during every equity sell-off. Seems it’s going to take a significant shock to get a run into the USD and TLT. And once that happens...back into gold, oil and selective US equities

1919 2018-04-24 19:50:36 All budget numbers are contingent on a continually recovering Oklahoma economy...which is tied heavily to the oil and gas sector...and the President is now saying oil prices are too high.  So there could be some more volatility for OK.
1920 2018-04-24 19:50:34 Waiting for my car to get an oil change & who do I see on the waiting area TV? The always lovely @mattcohen4real in @GeneralHospital ! Great choice, auto place. :D 
1921 2018-04-24 19:50:34 Hypothetically, let's say that they find oil, how would you value it?? Genuinely what to understand what you are saying....

1925 2018-04-24 19:49:50 Henrik, as you know i am looking for a deflationary bust that i think could get underway later this year. So don't disagree an the asset flush of equities, oil, gold, euro but not now, not yet. Big rally ahead for equities & gold before the big flush.
1926 2018-04-24 19:49:45 Yea it’s all fun and games until you gotta replace a run flat or it’s time for an oil change lmaooooo. The CLA is nice though so either are quality vehicles
1927 2018-04-24 19:49:44 I keep thinking of that 1984 movie Tank. That’s how it would go down here.

1932 2018-04-24 19:49:15 Oil price up, so lower earnings. We're near jobs report, which I'm guessing might see increased wage growth, and another market spook. Basically, inflation fears.
1933 2018-04-24 19:49:13 Suck and blow.  Can't be done.  No sign, no deal. Iran cozies up to RU, CN, IN, restarts nuclear program, buys weapons from them for oil.  Win-win, lose.
1934 2018-04-24 19:49:13 Same. SamJ did that to me (we followed each other for 3 years).
1935 2018-04-24 19:49:03 I said lack not that you didnt love yourself cuz at the end of the day you fuckin yourself over by not gettin an oil change
1936 2018-04-24 19:48:43 I'd have to agree!! Dosn't hurt as bad to step on a piece of IKEA furniture though. 
1937 2018-04-24 19:48:40 I dont know yet! Because yet to see if there is oil in the fking ground! Ill wait to see if they make a discovery to value the asset. Not bloody "in the ground value".
1938 2018-04-24 19:48:32 I’m sure they will lmfao. The Oil jokes are old but we really do spend like we’re Barcelona or PSG. Not a good look lowkey. Especially if we get beat out like we did in the UCL again.
1939 2018-04-24 19:48:30 In some cases they might have a 'concession', eg the butcher counter, in others they do it all themselves in a supermarket style.
1940 2018-04-24 19:48:28 I know why; and like I said....it's their loss.
1941 2018-04-24 19:48:24 I’d rather fight them than stand as allies.
1942 2018-04-24 19:48:14 @Valvoline please stop trying to upsell every little thing during an oil change.
1943 2018-04-24 19:48:07 @ShonaRobison Can I urge you to legalise #cannabidiol oil for medical purposes in #Scotland, assuming you have the power to do so? I have already asked @Jeremy_Hunt to do the same in #England, overcoming any objections from the @ukhomeoffice. See #Petition on @38_degrees.
1944 2018-04-24 19:48:02 One of my old coworkers grew up in LA during the 60s and 70s. He said a side-effect of the oil embargo in '73 was that you could actually see mountains in the distance that would otherwise be shrouded in smog.

1946 2018-04-24 19:47:47 It costs THOUSANDS of dollars to maintain a Lambo, you cannot get service for free like you got the car. Oil change and plugs, $4000. But I guess it was worth it to get that PR photo and video.

1949 2018-04-24 19:47:08 Is that the opposite to king dolla? Lol Ashraf what do you think of oil reaching 170.00 I was listening to an oil trader this morning who was asked and he thought sure why not? Ty gl :)
1950 2018-04-24 19:47:06 I'd like to know one thing. If the US has oil independence and we are selling it then why is the price going up at home? Seems to me as if the price should drop if we have that much oil.
1951 2018-04-24 19:47:05 Punta ako SM bukas bakit? Kase bibili ako ng oil control ubos na eh  HAHAHA
1952 2018-04-24 19:46:58 @SarahHuckabee First of all, don't call me a Dem. Second, I love my country very much. So much that I want to do things like fix our #infrastructure and the water in #Flint much more than I want to kill Syrian children and steal their oil. Imagine that.
1953 2018-04-24 19:46:58 Alberta conservatives want state control to protect their oil sales and deregulation for everything else 
1954 2018-04-24 19:46:41 You’ll swear Olive Oil. Whether it’s extra virgin or not, only you’re able to testify to that
1955 2018-04-24 19:46:23 Italian olive oil is fucking amazing
1956 2018-04-24 19:46:20 Like it:)
1957 2018-04-24 19:46:09 Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel–it produces half as much carbon pollution as coal, and one-third less than oil per unit burned. #gas #cleanenergy
1958 2018-04-24 19:46:05 I don't think @Oil_Guns_Merica knows my true identity...
1959 2018-04-24 19:45:57 Our club was built on hard work and determination, not oil money
1960 2018-04-24 19:45:57 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1961 2018-04-24 19:45:48 Some people have a tinder to find someone, I have one to get free oil changes
1962 2018-04-24 19:45:41 Welcome to the Future, where the Snake Oil Merchants Come to YOU.

1967 2018-04-24 19:45:28 Uh...I think Lego is more durable though...
1968 2018-04-24 19:45:18 Lol sometimes i don’t get a oil change but that doesn’t mean i don’t love myself 
1969 2018-04-24 19:45:09 Great point! This is why we emphasize transition. It's important to work out our next steps on path to change. Right now that still includes oil and gas, so we push for #renewables and energy diversification (+ better practices in the O&G industry)
1970 2018-04-24 19:45:08 Getting my oil changed and basic car maintenance done Friday morning. Then getting my camera cleaned this weekend. Chase season is almost here. #chasecation2018 

Also doing a storm chasing presentation at Berkley High School on Friday.

1972 2018-04-24 19:44:55 @clarins Blue Orchid Oil is my #40yearold skin saviour. #SmellsLushToo #CanIEatIt ?
1973 2018-04-24 19:44:46 Typical Central Canada thought process. That’s where all the votes are so that is where the Liberals think. Auto vs aerospace vs oil. Who wins? Not the West! Funny that the first 2 need the last one in order to function.
1974 2018-04-24 19:44:43 Are you serious? Our planet is more important than Alberta’s oil revenues. Suzuki is righteous here, you are not.
1975 2018-04-24 19:44:42 sorry I hate articles like this with a passion, They're about as useful as...we asked a real medieval Norwegian prince how realistic was hamlet...a real timelord about Doctor Who..a real Student Wizard about Harry Potter...a real oil tycoon about JR Ewing
1976 2018-04-24 19:44:41 #Tarsands Oil rules the roost in Alberta. Yee haw! You'd think with a 290,000 litre spill plus a 5M litre spill in one week (!) all these academics protesting Suzuki might give their stance a sober second thought, eh? Nah.. Nada.. Not a hope.

1983 2018-04-24 19:44:03 And who can hear the silent majority? Squeaky wheel gets the oil. Noisy pressure groups can be drowned out if challenged logically. We get the society we can be bothered to stand up for. Stand up!!
1984 2018-04-24 19:44:03 Is there an oil barge winding down the Cuyahoga River, rolling into Cleveland to the lake?
1985 2018-04-24 19:43:59 Very simple. 1lb ground duck, 1 diced  shallot, 1 diced cloves garlic, 1 tsp grated ginger, 2 tbs soy sauce, 1 tbs toasted seasame seeds, 1 tbs seasame oil, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes or hot sauce, 1/2 tsp sage, S&P to taste, 2 tbs almond meal. That’s it
1986 2018-04-24 19:43:58 I'll fry palm oil till the fumes is too much so we can all stay outside together...
1987 2018-04-24 19:43:53 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1988 2018-04-24 19:43:46 Where I live a lot of shops do that, very well. Typically targeted at their particular customer base but that actually enhances their wider appeal.
1989 2018-04-24 19:43:43 I love chalk brush. Round Fan is another favorite of mine, as well as spatter and oil pastel
1990 2018-04-24 19:43:41 The US just wants the oil homie like always. Don't get your hopes up.
1991 2018-04-24 19:43:38 Energy Drinks are actually Legalised Tinned Drugs. Energy Drink Addiction is now recognised. Piss off Lewis Hamilton you worthless Drug Pusher just drive your Environment Polluting Petrol/Oil driven cars and dont promote Addiction& Cancer causing Products.

2005 2018-04-24 19:42:21 Oil prices hit $75 the highest level in nearly three and a half years, as fears mounted over the prospect of new US sanctions on Iran!
2006 2018-04-24 19:42:14 Didnt u drive ur car last week or heat ur home. Stop doing that and they wont need to supply the oil. Simple. Stop talking and start doing
2007 2018-04-24 19:42:14 Allah Mata rahma
2008 2018-04-24 19:42:12 I hear you Dan....So the big Oil Companies are hoping someone wants to open a retail store and then O.C. hold retailers hostage by selling over inflated gas prices to the retailer... who then pass the inflated price onto the pubic. Is that correct?
2009 2018-04-24 19:42:12 you have no idea what you're talking about you're not even italian, alyssa mozzarrela gobbagoolio olive oil d'onfreo

2018 2018-04-24 19:40:41 The Federal Liberals failed to pass a motion restricting oil trade and opening the door to Eastern Canadian domestic priority on Alberta barrels and Alberta Conservatives are upset.  Also, geese are flying south.

2028 2018-04-24 19:39:55 He's added neither a nickel nor a dime to the value of any oil company he's worked for (Afren went bust in spectacular fashion - fraud), so although he's been handed shed loads of money by several, he's got no CV credentials in oil either. Bit odd really.

2040 2018-04-24 19:38:50 PIGEONS
Pigeons, oil-on-water sheen of
preened feathers seen aloft,
afloat on dusty august air,
resist the flow of dipping swallows,
crowd above the traffic there,
and roll a throaty burbling pitch,
like satin marbles.

2043 2018-04-24 19:38:42 Ironic to see #GOP "deregulation" of big banks, oil companies, and polluters while simultaneously ADDING regulations to unions, unemployment benefits, and social services for those most in need. A clear example of who the GOP ultimately serves --not "average Americans".
2044 2018-04-24 19:38:34 That's crazy of course I care! I think it's awesome! Of course I'm also hoping some of bolas's army comes into contact with some phyrexian oil...or that emrakul does but hey I just want to see everything go to shit

Ps: this steamer can no longer be used for inhaling
2050 2018-04-24 19:37:36 What makes it so funny is the fact that I talk to this chick with a 03 Corolla. She dgaf about the car, no oil changes or nothin. She was up to 242,XXX miles on it last time I checked, she says when it dies she’s gonna get a new car, this was 6 years ago Muhfucka run like a CHAMP
2051 2018-04-24 19:37:34 Walking works.  Most of my mileage was walking or hiking.  Same/similar issue with knees.  Also try Krill oil or other Omega product to help with joint pain. I started with Krill and now use a broad spectrum, plant-based omega product.  Game changers!

2094 2018-04-24 19:32:22 can't wait for election eve when every candidate will be accused of frying babies in cooking oil
2095 2018-04-24 19:32:10 The dealership just told me to take a survey to get two free oil changes and a car wash I just save myself 230 bucks for taking a five minute survey thank you Jesus 
2096 2018-04-24 19:31:59 @MyAfricanPride@curlbox can we use the oil as a prepoo
2097 2018-04-24 19:31:52 I really need to go get an oil change before I blow up this car too

2099 2018-04-24 19:31:32 Wow. I hadn’t heard about this while over here in Oxford on sabbatical. As an alumnus, I agree that if @UAlberta caves to oil companies on this it will be a black stain.
2100 2018-04-24 19:31:26 I’m going get Lil  & Bray, they going with me to get a oil change. Ima have to bring them to the snowball stand before we go to Honda 
2101 2018-04-24 19:31:10 I feel like watching Braveheart right now.
2102 2018-04-24 19:30:52 That is buzz fucking lightyear after an oil bath Jesus

2107 2018-04-24 19:30:08 Ladies....this summer please refresh your wigs and weaves. Give it a good wash before the heat hits. Spray it down with diluted peppermint and tea tree oil to keep it smelling clean. Take care.
2108 2018-04-24 19:30:03 Gaddafi had many enemies, more than Nigeria, S.

2112 2018-04-24 19:29:41 thank you  I’ve been drowning it in tea tree oil!!! I just need to get rid of my acne scars
2113 2018-04-24 19:29:20 After I fix lenjhibhabha, I think I’m going to lock my hair again.

2116 2018-04-24 19:28:58 One of the professor who always comes into Olive Oil was telling me how he can't believe that I'm also a student who works as much as I do, and honestly I don't even think it was supposed to be a compliment but I took it as one 
2117 2018-04-24 19:28:58 Maybe if we had oil, gas or a strategic port, I could foresee an immediate cash cow. Zim that’s not the case. We have wealth that is capital intensive in mines and agriculture
2118 2018-04-24 19:28:54 @pius_adesanmi said and I quote 'Palm oil sellers don't care too much for the reputation of the lone white danshiki wearer among them'.
2119 2018-04-24 19:28:42 You are delusional. You're OK with the tax overhaul? You're OK with national parks being raided for gas and oil? You're ok with people in our military being deported? You believe this is democracy? Nothing Trump does is making us great. It's just making us a laughing stock.
2120 2018-04-24 19:28:39 yea ima go get my oil changed to find out i need a new suspension and 3k worth of repairs bro I love being an adult :)
2121 2018-04-24 19:28:39 #ableg Bulliten! @JustinTrudeau and #LPC don't think Canadian  Energy Self Sufficiency is important enough to make it into Policy Book! But @AlbertaParty Fakeezzie ready to burn "liar" @jkenney in oil for quoting @DonBraid It's politics as usual folks.
2122 2018-04-24 19:28:36 I hate getting my oil changed.
2123 2018-04-24 19:28:27 I’m seeing disinflationary/deflationary flush, as equities, oil, gold, euro drops, due to shortage of liquidity (usd). Hence, short everything - but USD and soon (after yield spike) TLT
2124 2018-04-24 19:28:22 My skin care routine? I drink a gallon of sins a day and moisturize with coconut oil
2125 2018-04-24 19:28:15 Do it often. Slice into thick slices. Drizzle with olive oil, salt, paprika. Heat pan in oven, put in cauliflower. Turn a few times  Remove when browned. Makes amazing soup.
2126 2018-04-24 19:28:10 Looking for buyers of hardwood charcoal, honey, cashew nuts and palm kernel oil in anywhere in the world.
2127 2018-04-24 19:28:02 a good place for ideas, for furniture that you can build yourself, out of actual wood, instead of the painted cardboard IKEA furniture is made of
2128 2018-04-24 19:27:34 Here's a tip! Try saturating the tape in a household oil like baby oil or olive oil for 5 minutes before removal. Also make sure to remove slowly, pulling the skin away from the tape.
2129 2018-04-24 19:27:33 I honestly think the B&S is just a better motor overall. You can beat the hell out of them and they'll still run like the day they were new. Bad fuel? Good fuel? Wrong fuel? Still runs. Overheat? Still runs. No oil? Still runs.
2130 2018-04-24 19:27:31 Oil is at a 3 year high, gas prices are moving up, almost daily. Let’s keep making America great again. Thanks Mob Dad!!!!

2132 2018-04-24 19:27:19 Besides I use coconut oil with a scent, probably the only man on this planet who learn from women how to do it
2133 2018-04-24 19:27:15 I’d love to go to Bears Ears...,,oh wait right you all let POTUS shrink it’s size and allow drilling for oil on Tribal Lands. Nice that you respect the parks
2134 2018-04-24 19:27:14 My new hobbies include: going to Disneyland, eating whatever the hell I want & changing the oil in my car. Lol
2135 2018-04-24 19:27:12 No mention of how this fits into Alberta's climate change strategy, through increased revenue from the carbon levy invested in green tech, and constrained by emission caps on oilsands industry. Also seems to count "facilitated" emissions from exported oil (mostly to China).
2136 2018-04-24 19:27:10 AVAILABLE- by mail, in all 50 states? That's an Open Society tactic, Mr. Rand Paul, picking fights that have already been won. CBC Oil DOESN'T have THC in it. That's what used - and you KNEW that. I could never figure out why you did that - used that fallacy of an argument...
2137 2018-04-24 19:26:52 Robert, stop drilling, you’ve hit oil. Most of your viewers are convinced the Labour Party is much more racist than the tories.
2138 2018-04-24 19:26:52 Trying to put on jeans after putting on oil/lotion 
2139 2018-04-24 19:26:42 New tires, new brakes, and a oil change ... ugh being on the road is so expensive 
2140 2018-04-24 19:26:41 Jamaican black castor oil for the beard
2141 2018-04-24 19:26:34 I'm referring to the value placed on "barrels of oil in the ground". When oil was at $30 per barrel, the "in ground" value was $2 per barrel. As the price of oil increases, the "in ground" value will increase. Hope that's clear it up.....
2142 2018-04-24 19:26:13 A mistake... That is what's like!

2145 2018-04-24 19:25:55 Any follow up on the rosemary oil/hair growing experiment? Any advice for supplements for chronic infection?
2146 2018-04-24 19:25:40 i *vaguely* remember reading some article like 6 years ago about olive oil and garlic being goodish for heart health and ive really just let that dictate my entire diet since then
2147 2018-04-24 19:25:35 dont forget the olive oil
2148 2018-04-24 19:25:30 Are you working to protect the coastlines of Georgia? Are you going to say NO to oil drilling off the shores of Georgia? You need to protect those barrier islands, not be all about big business all the time.
2149 2018-04-24 19:25:24 Don't worry about inflation -- it's not coming outside the base effect of oil..
2150 2018-04-24 19:25:23 Specialists in inland oil spill remediation... What the hell was going on in the city centre today?
2151 2018-04-24 19:25:21 It’s all about who you wanna travel the world with. Also that person has to be willing to put tanning oil on your back, not half assed either
2152 2018-04-24 19:25:19 I need oil 
2153 2018-04-24 19:25:07 Will this be
snake oil vs no snake oil
or the expected 
Snake oil vs other snake oil?
2154 2018-04-24 19:25:04 Fraudulent Auto Repair Express Oil B'ham,@ALReporter
2155 2018-04-24 19:24:59 The popular narrative is inflation breaking out leading to higher short & long rates & lower stock market. I think the commodity run led by oil is over & so inflation lower, equities & T-bonds higher & USD lower. And of course, gold higher on weak USD.
2156 2018-04-24 19:24:55 I tore my dad a new one for letting the househelp take my sister to her church and I really should have just saved my breath because the child came home talking about someone putting anointing oil and rope on her ears.
2157 2018-04-24 19:24:47 When the head is sick, the body is not far from death. The body cannot be drenched when the head lacks oil. The body cannot be more anointed than the head it's carrying because oil flows from the head to the body...How oiled is your head?

2158 2018-04-24 19:24:47 @MyAfricanPride can we heat the oil up
2159 2018-04-24 19:24:32 Oh I don’t know. I think the US and our western allies wouldn’t last a week without Middle East oil. Someone should educate this clown about the reasons for US involvement in endless armed and political conflicts in the Middle East.

2161 2018-04-24 19:24:18 Your backing band didn't play the scary music when you wrote "big oil" so it failed to scare me.  If you have a problem with people expressing their political will by financing campaigns might I suggest that a republic is not the system of government you wish to live under
2162 2018-04-24 19:24:17 Yeah I don't want to put a downer on proceedings, but at this point it's also a bit late for taking out a life insurance policy, no matter how much peppermint oil you soak them in

2170 2018-04-24 19:23:27 Clinical trials in humans ROUTINELY blind study data so it is possible to share it publicly while showing no patient private information.  Honestly, who comes up with this?

2177 2018-04-24 19:22:50 the war between the oil barons will continue until an oil king is crowned.
2178 2018-04-24 19:22:45 sebastian really referenced maya angelou, talked about wakandan coconut oil and tried to speak xhosa in one damn interview,,, wakanda really cultured bighead
2179 2018-04-24 19:22:44 Retweeted Quincy Roberts (@quincysings):

Bambam launched her beauty Oil today.
She sold out all 5000 pieces she had for starters.
Each bottle costs N5000...

Bambam made N25M in a day. 

That's a strong woman with goals and strategies. Mad! 
2180 2018-04-24 19:22:06 You’d think that after almost four years in the oil fields I’d be good at goodbyes.... wrong. Horribly wrong
2181 2018-04-24 19:22:04 To be clear, it is not oil itself, but rather a legacy of polarizing Venezuelan petro-diplomacy that produced deadlock in regional institutions such as OAS. This creates obstacles to applying mechanisms designed to defend democracy such as the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
2182 2018-04-24 19:21:53 I was aware of this, its fluoride free but learned it has carageenan or something similar. I will try the peppermint + coco oil + charcoal mix :)
2183 2018-04-24 19:21:53 IKEA is a place normal people will visit once but probably never a second.

2185 2018-04-24 19:21:44 @Gaiapatra Did CBD oil ever start helping your anxiety? If so, how much? I have a friend who is trying it out for the first time with severe anxiety. I'm hoping it really helps him.
2186 2018-04-24 19:21:39 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'
2187 2018-04-24 19:21:38 This week I described hash oil as “sludgy” and I think now that is a very good description on the whole. Not a big deal but wanted to be honest. Another description will be provided upon request.

2191 2018-04-24 19:21:22 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2192 2018-04-24 19:21:19 My mom just called me to ask how my oil change went.. I told her I’m pissed that my car takes synthetic oil, bc it cost me 60 bucks... she said “you always wanted to be grown, how does it feel now”. I wonder what it feels like to have a mom that loves you
2193 2018-04-24 19:21:13 You hear all the time that coconut oil is too heavy for the hair, why did you go with coconut oil instead of a lighter oil?
2194 2018-04-24 19:21:11 What makes Baobab Oil & Coconut oil a good oil combo? In reference to the leave-in. @curlBOX @MyAfricanPride #AprilCurlBoxChat

2198 2018-04-24 19:20:47 It's ok for me. We have a lot of territory, a lot of sea and a lot of oil to be fighting for a small island. I just wish we could stop seeing like enemies.

2207 2018-04-24 19:20:04 You think they dont want to admit that many millions are missing? Do they're saying g not much missing and then instead trying to claw it back from pi's and the fcsc compensation,.. As if we're stupid.
2208 2018-04-24 19:19:52 Not with Trump, you won't. His administration only cares about their oil buddies.
2209 2018-04-24 19:19:50 I did read the silly @CBCNews propaganda piece

1) Summer -Always applies,  pointless
2) The US - Always applies, pointless
3) Pipeline Problems - Most of Canada does not get gas/oil by pipeline
4) Rail Strike - Most gas is shipped by truck
5) Loonie - Always applies, pointless

2211 2018-04-24 19:19:38 Serious question, if Saudi Arabia was a poor country with no oil money do you think WWE would ever run a show there?  When your morals changes bases on money you have no morals.  WWE is far from alone is this, and more people should be speaking out about it.
2212 2018-04-24 19:19:36 Yes - in the past I've spoke to some retailers who find that others are reluctant to work together on a common goal/aim and I never understand why when its for the greater good!
2213 2018-04-24 19:19:24 @MyAfricanPride @curlBOX how do you recommend to use the oil? can it be mixed with the masque? Can it be used with other treatments? #aprilcurlboxchat

2230 2018-04-24 19:17:56 You're rewriting history. There's was plenty of Bush hate against him and his supporters. Remember "NO BLOOD FOR OIL"?  Also, the Left is more deranged now than before BHO made GWB palatable to them.

2232 2018-04-24 19:17:46 This is so very true and we had this conversation today. I do wish local competing retailers wouldn't get into "price wars". Margins need to be protected. So many fail through over discounting and de-sensitising consumers. #indiehour
2233 2018-04-24 19:17:43 Venezuela produced 2.38 mbd of crude oil in 2016 and 2.10
mbd in the third quarter of 2017. The latest production
figure stands at 1.62 mbd in December 2017, and
many expect that it will decline to close to 1.0 mbd by
the end of 2018. LAMENTABLE
2234 2018-04-24 19:17:40 Rubs are helpful but daily cbd oil ingestion is better for chronic pain. CBD is totally legal and you can get it at any headshop. Palmetto Harmony is good.

Lil tune up  ,  Lil oil change 
2238 2018-04-24 19:17:08 agree - it also depends how you describe your product - a few descriptive words can make all the difference - especially if they reflect your #indie status - stressing local or hand crafted or from within 20 miles etc - and talking about the provenance #indiehour
2239 2018-04-24 19:17:06 #OOTT,, Even with a Draw I don't see Oil settling above 72.00 72.50 folks are just not ready imho for 80 buck bbl. The 72-75 area can be absorbed. anything else will be a shock to the economy. Balance is the OPEC keyword.
2240 2018-04-24 19:17:02 So I am (probably) allergic to the sesame oil my T is suspended in & I'll probably have to switch to the more expensive alternative which is...just great
2241 2018-04-24 19:17:01 And we get Oil in return for our money spent. What exactly did we get in return for giving Iran money, they're still a problem. Why not give that money to Americans and tell Iran we cant afford to give them any money, we gave it all to our citizens. Wouldnt that be $ better spent
2242 2018-04-24 19:16:59 Raoul, I agree. I would be a buyer of T-bonds, U.S. stocks, gold and the euro here and be selling USD and oil.
2243 2018-04-24 19:16:58 Castor oil girl. That’s how I got Ava out.
2244 2018-04-24 19:16:45 Yes, he takes a teaspoon every night of coconut oil. Tommy has had epilepsy for 6 years. Pruny had epilepsy too, we hate it!
2245 2018-04-24 19:16:39 Not bad, apart from the allergies kicking in due to the yellow rape seed oil crops - I need a gas mask when I'm driving to work at the mo! #writeforum
2246 2018-04-24 19:16:35 Massage your clean face in circular upward motion with a bit of olive oil before going to bed at night and wake up with a glowing, smoother and younger-looking skin. But olive oil can clog pores, so if you are prone to acne, mix it with mineral oil before applying.

2247 2018-04-24 19:16:29 Sorry but there are no health benefits involved in eating chocolate, the lady on #TopOfTheShop is engaging in snake oil sales technique here. Not sure she can genuinely believe it.
2248 2018-04-24 19:16:25 Covonia cough medicine. Also vile, but worked! As a child I used to like a decongestant oil evaporating over a candle at night when I had a cold. The flickering light and smell used to lull me to sleep and ease the symptoms. Can no longer get them tho' 
2249 2018-04-24 19:16:25 Tolerance of others is always of value but with that tolerance we should expect reciprocal response. Tolerance of the left has cost us freedoms, attacks of the first amendment, the second amendment and freedom of religion. Tolerance of the left is snake oil for sale.
2250 2018-04-24 19:16:23 What if the oil in the earth is its lubricant.

2253 2018-04-24 19:16:04 I was in your boat a few years back (severe nerve damage in my back/kidneys and chronic migraines) and spent three years on Norco and hated everything/one. CBD oil stopped all of that: no pain meds, no pain, nothing. If you can, try it.
Don't lose hope. ♡
2254 2018-04-24 19:15:47 Can you say "Climate Change" now? My confidence in you would be enhanced by reducing air pollution, cutting coal/oil/gas/mining, turning toward clean renewable energy, addressing climate change, banning Dow's chlorpyrifos,...

2256 2018-04-24 19:15:37 Yes they're making up numbers because they know the fcsc will pay most of it. 
Funny thing is I only have ONE line of stock in an unlisted price company which they will struggle to sell or do anything with. I just want the certificates and be done.
2257 2018-04-24 19:15:20 Darwin's evolutionary intelligence goes to the Glacial, the death of fictions, like Conrad's narrating oil.

2259 2018-04-24 19:15:12 Nigerian man and woman rights are oil and water, have you seen how nigerian "western african" bouncers manhandle woman in clubs from Pretoria to Cape Town, this idoits haras woman and defenceless club goers, especially when the club owner is white their treat blacks like shit.

2262 2018-04-24 19:15:07 Another Trudeau Senator lectures on the evils of oil.
2263 2018-04-24 19:15:03 Now dems are complaining of rising wages, debt/deficit contributing to inflation is a prob. 
Since when? Since Trump?
2264 2018-04-24 19:14:42 Wow you didn't come to me for help lk hurt. Jk. 3D whitening strips or if your on a true budget buy a tub of coconut oil scoop a spoonful of it & put it in your mouth DONT EAT IT, swish it in your mouth like mouth for about a min or more. Then spit it out, natural whitening!!!
2265 2018-04-24 19:14:34 Twice a week is ok,use oil to moisturize your face after

2271 2018-04-24 19:14:14 Lol I’m as independent as they come. trump sheep are ok with him dismantling the FBI to stop investigations into him. Your GOP snake oil salesmen have investigated her for 30 years and never charged her with a parking ticket. You people look insane to people not in your cult. Bye
2272 2018-04-24 19:14:12 Then, epoxy is pumped into the base of the brush head. They machine all three openings. It's made from sustainable palm oil.
2273 2018-04-24 19:14:07 Told a lady one time that now she knows what indigenous people feel like on an itsy tiny scale (when parking in front of her house is taken). Add an oil rig or pipeline in that spot and that kicks things up a notch or two  #IGetIt

2277 2018-04-24 19:13:36 I think @georgegalloway @talkradio is quite right to highlight the UK Govts & MSMs duplicity in failing to highlight the #Saudi atrocities in #Yemen but takes every opportunity to point finger of blame @ #Syria & #Russia. These Oil related double standards are an anathema to me.
2278 2018-04-24 19:13:22 I just beat cuphead on a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change for this mix lots of my peers getting sucked into
2279 2018-04-24 19:13:21 I'm a mechanic so I have to ask, you do change your oil regularly, right?
2280 2018-04-24 19:13:21 The balance of labor vs demand in a non inflationary enviro is complex. On one side unrestricted flow of labor is disruptive.
2281 2018-04-24 19:13:20 My President approved $469 million from the country's Excess Crude Oil account, Legislators claim they were not properly debriefed. Just some politicking and blame trading
2282 2018-04-24 19:13:15 If Mania Plus completely removes Oil Ocean from the game, I’d be So Happy
2283 2018-04-24 19:13:06 Repetitive behaviours as a result of anxiety are not cool, I checked my oil constantly for 5 minutes whilst adding some yesterday, which resulted in me leaving the oil cap off when I could finally stop and destroying my engine, happy Tuesday folks
2284 2018-04-24 19:13:00 Well quick update poor LAYLA (VN800) is poorly still some silly sausage let the chain dry out over winter ohhhh and then took off the sprocket so got kinks in it while it had no oil on it so now gotta get a new chain she not gonna be ready for weekend BOOOOO
2285 2018-04-24 19:12:37 If the oil is processed in Oregon like other states. Generates jobs and taxes. That in turn is spent in the local economies and benefits Oregon. With no sales tax. Tourism benefits only a few folks as well. Wish our prop tax and income tax was lower with sales tax.
2286 2018-04-24 19:12:36 Maybe the truck didn’t arrive... i see crude oil output plunge
2287 2018-04-24 19:12:25 tomatoes, potatoes, and oil is all i've been putting into my body
2288 2018-04-24 19:12:20 Access for who? The people are angry that politicians have allowed private interests to rape and pillage the nations public lands with destructive toxic mining, unsustainable subsidized logging and devastating oil drilling. Big money profits, we clean up the mess. This must end.
2289 2018-04-24 19:12:18 I had an argument with him once, pointed out how the oil companies were getting tax breaks where Norway were charging them to extract oil. I linked to industry articles and included Shell & BP admitting as much. I think he blocked me 
2290 2018-04-24 19:12:15 One of countries close to Saudi Arabia recently found enough oil to last for the next several hundred years. How do you think that will effect the price? If you think accelerated climate change is a hox perhaps you run an exhaust pipe from Car to house.
2291 2018-04-24 19:12:11 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
2292 2018-04-24 19:12:11 Ooo have you! Yeah I love a light cream for daytime and a heavier one or an oil for nighttime!

2297 2018-04-24 19:11:23 Councils are struggling as their income goes down and they are running out of services to cut, so their simplistic reaction may often be to raise parking costs, scaring away more customers from town centres. #Indiehour

2300 2018-04-24 19:11:10 Defffffinitely gonna have to pass on that one. Nasty. I hope I never get to a stage in life of such disconnect with human relationships where the most exciting technological development I’m looking forward to is a synthetic robot to replace a substantial and wholesome partner
2301 2018-04-24 19:10:59 Actually not a bad idea. If we can have a million  bioCNG plants all over the country, we can 
1) Get our own homegrown CNG
2) Create million jobs
3) Save our cows, economical in old age even
4) Reduce global warming
5) Reduce fiscal deficit due to crude oil imports
2302 2018-04-24 19:10:59 What legal standing are you basing that on?   We give Saudi Arabia our money through oil

2313 2018-04-24 19:09:57 Your going way of the subject and yes it all boils down to OIL. What I'm saying is money spent on the armed forces is by far to much but the troops are there to try to educate and try to keep peace and safety
2314 2018-04-24 19:09:51 Yes
2315 2018-04-24 19:09:45 No one told me that getting a nicer car meant spending 50 on an oil change

2317 2018-04-24 19:09:18 Note to think on..if we flood euro with oil? Whats to stop isis hideaways from buying it up to resupply with? too soon to let flow?
2318 2018-04-24 19:09:18 Oil prices ^ US$75/barrel means gas prices will reach J $200/litre. How will this impact our productivity? SCT on gas implemented some time ago impacts price. COL increase despite <130J $=1$US. Global factors impact small states but we all need 2 manage our taxes.#nogrowth

2322 2018-04-24 19:09:03 Currency globally needs to shift from being stapled to oil futures, to being stapled to green energy backed currency.  It's prone to less destabilization, based upon fossil fuel procurement, and conflict over procurement.

2328 2018-04-24 19:08:37 Employment is very local/regional. A top down central planning approach is not logical. This applies to many wasteful  Fed gov programs.
2329 2018-04-24 19:08:32 Agreed. The only way to even keep tabs on an unaccountable bureaucratic agency is through measures like this. No more secret or half-hidden crap.

2340 2018-04-24 19:07:27 They are so nice though. I collect a lot of surplus firearms and I just dunk the receiver in one end and let it go for 30 minutes, dry then re oil. Makes things easy.
2341 2018-04-24 19:07:25 What good  is  it  when oil and food prices are soaring  out of control. maybe  you  should  control  Government  spending. Your Comerce  secretary should  do his job and check  what is going  on
2342 2018-04-24 19:07:18 If oil comes from animals are vegans even allowed drive cars? 
2343 2018-04-24 19:07:18 What about Oil and Gold
2344 2018-04-24 19:07:00 Went to the dealer for my oil change, appointment was at 11, they said it would be 3 hrs, which would be fine, if I didn't have to be at work at 2. 
2345 2018-04-24 19:06:58 I need an oil change like two months ago
2346 2018-04-24 19:06:56 Oil will be hit the same!  : ]
2347 2018-04-24 19:06:41 Empowering what a lusting word you are using. Digging hydrocarbon wells, equating  CH4 gaseous will never bring you food. Empowered nations digging wells in the oil fields whereas our nation digging in agriculture fields.

2358 2018-04-24 19:05:49 Especially with people like @EPAScottPruitt in positions of importance. There are people skeptical of climate science, but they don't bat an eyelash when Exxon Mobile tells them it's nothing to worry about.  A skeptic of the scientist should be twice as careful with the oil CEO.

-Drink some water.
-Put nail oil or cream for your face etc on
-open the window
-put on your favourite clothes

2371 2018-04-24 19:04:35 Hello, we have Dexter who is recently diagnosed. Have you tried coconut oil? Feel free to DM and we can exchange info. It’s a really horrible condition 
2372 2018-04-24 19:04:33 vape oil. Please I must see
2373 2018-04-24 19:04:15 I want to know why our gas prices are over $3. per gallon? When l just read the US flooded Europe with over 10 billion barrels of oil per day. 

Anyone know why gas prices keep going up here?
2374 2018-04-24 19:04:15 Took my /CL June 71 call off for a .23 cr win. With oil moving down today my scalp/hedge strategy did its job. 18% of total capital being used. Gotta get more money back to work to create more occurrences. Vol jumping up hopefully provides new opportunity.
2375 2018-04-24 19:04:12 So England now has all the Oil, I suppose they have all whisky too, and all we have is their debt?
2376 2018-04-24 19:03:58 I do: 1. Glycolic 2. Niancinamide 3. Retin 4. Oil and an SPF during the Day. Eased my way in slowly. Great results
2377 2018-04-24 19:03:51 @realDonaldTrump First no such thing as “less than nothing “ (might explain your bankruptcies). What we got was a constant flow of oil which was the basic reason we were there. When we do become independent of crude.... that’s another conversation that requires long term planning
2378 2018-04-24 19:03:45 Wipes won’t make a difference. Invest in a serum, moisturiser or oil! 
2379 2018-04-24 19:03:44 The Government of Alberta sets the royalty on the raw oil production regardless of end use or market.  You do know that AB trades at a discount to WTI partially because of lack of market access (pipeline capacity)?
2380 2018-04-24 19:03:43 Jobs will be the focus of my administration. 

What we need in Nigeria is not a traditional politician but a technocrat who can manage the economy of Nigeria. Thereby creating an economy that is led by innovation.

Nigeria should have no business importing oil - @MoghaluKingsley

Where do you figure oil co's would set the royalties?
The global spot price... for WTI. Wouldn't it be cool if Canada could export that? WE'D GET MORE MONEY FOR IT!

2433 2018-04-24 18:58:11 The ignorance would be stunning if he weren't just a liar for the fossil fuel industry. He knows CO2 is warming the atmosphere. That's settled science. But his masters in the oil and gas industry pay him to be a liar.

2437 2018-04-24 18:57:36 Actually yes, 94% of all UK onshore O&G reserves are in England, a large supply of offshore as well. Largest offshore gas field is in English waters but it is called UK oil and gas, there's no distinction.

2441 2018-04-24 18:57:12 Possible. It is always in Putin's interest to fan the flames of instability & war in the mid-East because that raises the fear premium on oil which is Russia's most profitable export.

2444 2018-04-24 18:56:37 Who exactly is dropping royalties to zero?  That link talks about where TMX oil could end up.  Regardless of the end user you do know the net price back is based on global spot price right?
2445 2018-04-24 18:56:31 Yes!  Obama did get blamed!  And Obama did something! When it was over $4 under Bush, Bush got blamed.  And Bush did something.  

It takes public outcry for them to do something.  Oil companies make million for every cent gas goes up.  Oil companies delay lowering prices.

2460 2018-04-24 18:55:18 US crude oil stocks are expected to have declined by 2.65 million bbls last week, according to a Reuters poll. The poll also found that gasoline inventories declined by almost 1 million bbls, while distillate fuel stocks withdrew by more than 800,000 bbls.

2472 2018-04-24 18:53:59 If one person doesn't have the skills for the job market, it's on them. If millions don't, that's a societal failure. We have lots of talented people on sidelines or underemployed. Perhaps putting them to work on projects to benefit public can be win win.
2473 2018-04-24 18:53:59 You don't think that will eventually happen when we can no longer print our way out of trouble, meaning when the world no longer relies on dollars for the trade of oil?

2481 2018-04-24 18:53:09 Michael Moore (who just celebrated his b-day btw) captured some of these lunatics on film - down on #WallSt - talking about starting wars like they were chatting about the weather. I've heard similarly in passing (a long time ago already) about the oil industry. --
2482 2018-04-24 18:53:03 Indian markets are also medium term on downwards trajectory - oil , inflation , interest rates will send cash out of equities.
2483 2018-04-24 18:52:49 This is the oil rich Nigeria I take it so doesn't really fall into the world's 50 poorest does it

2485 2018-04-24 18:52:42 Nope. Flagstaff is the same. It’s because they are switching to the summer blend or some BS like that. So greedy oil companies are charging us for it.
2486 2018-04-24 18:52:29 How about pull out of Syria, make peace with Iran, arrest Saudi royal family 4 911 and seize their oil in  compensation. Ally with Russia 2 counter China and force peace deal on Israel.  Boom. Done.

2490 2018-04-24 18:52:01 I’m waiting to have the oil in my car changed and on the other side of this waiting room I swear I’m seeing the live version of Ross and Rachel’s “we were on a break” happening.
2491 2018-04-24 18:52:00 Venezuela: largest oil reserves in the world. Mostly in poverty & debt.

South Africa: largest mineral deposits on earth. 40% u/e, slow growth, falling per capita income.
2492 2018-04-24 18:51:52 @realDonaldTrump is mad about High oil prices, knowing full well it will render his tax cuts pointless. He must know that backing out of Iran deal ensures even higher prices than today. The Iran deal being salvaged is now back on the table.
2493 2018-04-24 18:51:48 I'll definitely pass the suggestion for a coconut Shampoo Bar along to our teams, love! In the meantime, we do have our Curly Wurly Shampoo that's packed full of creamed coconut and coconut oil to moisturize dry, frizzy hair. 
2494 2018-04-24 18:51:47 Poorly marketed jobs. I researched in 2010 after leaving Const after 20 yrs due to illegal labor. Got hazmat/tanker frm start. Put in 2 yrs
2495 2018-04-24 18:51:42 I'm with u trust me but I'm a big believer in steps and to me this...parking lot cover as u call it...is still a step in the right direction it may not be monumental & in comparison to the oil stuff it's rather trivial but give them a break they´re trying  #SaudiArabia #Solar #AI

2500 2018-04-24 18:51:17 Rosemary shampoo will help with that. Add some pure essential Rosemary hair oil (few drops) to your shampoo. Buy a better quality shampoo with less chemicals in it.
2501 2018-04-24 18:50:59 For a natural POC, oil gets on every piece of clothing I own apparently smh
2502 2018-04-24 18:50:47 if you threaten/attack Iran, America will pay with their economy. Oil will jump over 100dollars a barrel.

2504 2018-04-24 18:50:10 @SenWarren will go down in history as someone who had the ability to change the world by supporting the candidate who the people wanted, but instead like a greedy psychopath joined forced with sex cultist, warmongering, oil and gas pushing, anti environmentalist Hillary Clinton.
2505 2018-04-24 18:50:07 Norway's success 'We have as much Oil as they do'
Does he mean England?
2506 2018-04-24 18:49:57 oh no this is like the opposite it's like "don't bother with oil but we'll still make your food perfect super crispy omg" so I can feel marginally less unhealthy!
2507 2018-04-24 18:49:56 trying to convince all my friends that we need to fight each other in a kiddie pool with baby oil but no ones down i’m annoyed i need new friends
2508 2018-04-24 18:49:53 Today, I hung out with scientists and engineers in their labs to learn about the technology that goes into oil. Or witchcraft, as I like to call it.
2509 2018-04-24 18:49:50 I was just at the ford dealership for TWO HOURS just waiting on an oil change and wow I’m never doing another adult thing in my life.
2510 2018-04-24 18:49:49 "oil is listed as optional" amen
2511 2018-04-24 18:49:42 @IngrahamAngle I used to hold your position, but I am totally converted after watching recovery after recovery by getting on simple cannabis oil (no THC so no psychotropic affects). They get off the pain meds!  Their diabetes reverses! Pain is gone! They are sleeping again.
2512 2018-04-24 18:49:33 HA! Yes. Mainly fags, booze and oil on my list, but the odd airline, energy drink and aftermarket producer plus a couple of corporate manufacturer liveries lurking in there.
2513 2018-04-24 18:49:18 I think peppermint oil will be the last thing anyone in rigor Mortis will need!

2517 2018-04-24 18:48:48 Was just wondering the status of the manomellette fryathon. I'd heard something about a little saltpeter being added to the pepper and olive oil ... is that the right recipe @caitrionambalfe ?? 
2518 2018-04-24 18:48:30 If you take Dino Melaye and FG matter seriously and personally, then you are still under the siege and shackles of mental slavery of how Nigeria operates 

Na so dem dey run am here.... Las las... Oil go rub hands and everything go die
2519 2018-04-24 18:48:17 Oil is better than moisturizer but it also depends on your skin type. I only exfoliate once a week because I’ve noticed my skin is too sensitive for me to do it more than that.
2520 2018-04-24 18:48:09 that’s not that bad if they used synthetic oil
2521 2018-04-24 18:48:09 The guy changing my oil said "Ain't my problem" and continued to work on my car instead of help with that situation lmao
2522 2018-04-24 18:48:06 The @DevilsTowerNM is in the details. Why spoil some lands through (ANWLR) through oil and mining exploitation so we can fix other overused parks which should have never become this behind on maintenance? Oh I know, because we gave tax breaks to banks & wealthy to $1Trilllion.
2523 2018-04-24 18:48:00 Off to other appointment, and oil change
2524 2018-04-24 18:47:59 They got nothin' on ancient greek wrestlers who used to rub each other's nude bodies down with olive oil

2525 2018-04-24 18:47:38 I'm getting my oil changed, and the car next to me is sliding off the lift holding it up to change the tires.
2526 2018-04-24 18:47:25 Wish I could remember the article, but read nearly a decade ago that basically said water would be the oil of the 21st century
2527 2018-04-24 18:47:14 I don’t think anyone uses returnable bottles anymore as it costs more to wash them out and disinfect them than it does to get new ones - and there’s more recycling plants now!!  It was worse when the kegs came back with oil in them 
2528 2018-04-24 18:47:12 describe your argument better than this.

2536 2018-04-24 18:46:13 Why is it every time you go to the mechanic for a simple oil change they be like well you need the 1234456 wipers with the bulletproof lights and the invisible tires all for the price of 790 dollars
2537 2018-04-24 18:46:13 So which owners do you have lined up Russ? An oil rich Arab state on a sporting soft power exercise? Or a billionaire favoured by autocrats?
2538 2018-04-24 18:46:10 All about Russian oil
2539 2018-04-24 18:46:06 So let’s stop jerking around and shut down BC’s oil supply. This has gone on long enough.
2540 2018-04-24 18:46:04 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2541 2018-04-24 18:46:04 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2542 2018-04-24 18:46:00 A hellish, European maze of press-board furniture that you have to assemble yourself, using directions that are specifically ill-designed to assist you. Walking out, you'll be greeted by a "diner" offering fare that makes airline food look appetizing...

2552 2018-04-24 18:44:30 Basically, we went thousands if not millions of years living off natural, wholesome food. Now, it's often tainted with a bunch of junk (added sugar, color, oil), that's going to be disruptive(genome). Genes literally get confused by those things, they need traditional nutrients.

2575 2018-04-24 18:42:40 UK inflation is linked strongly to the price of basic commodities. Most of these are priced in US Dollars. Oil, foodstuffs, etc.
2576 2018-04-24 18:42:34 Capital Economics: #World #economy can cope with higher #oil prices "We think the recent rise in oil prices is likely to be reversed. But even if prices rose steadily to $100pb, there would be little fallout for #global #growth, despite an increase in headline #inflation"
2577 2018-04-24 18:42:33 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to anyone who can rustle up $50 and a smile. I'll get a good price!

2581 2018-04-24 18:42:24 We have a thriving seafood and tourism economy on the Oregon coast, which would no doubt be negatively impacted if we drilled for oil. Even Zinke says we have no known resources of any weight.

2583 2018-04-24 18:42:13 @DavidSuzuki Thank you! So sad to see environmentalists labeled Eco Terrorists by oil addicted Albertans. Please keep educating even those who seemingly don't want to learn. Congratulations @uAlberta for your courage and integrity.
2584 2018-04-24 18:42:08 FFS - you are admitting that the upgrader and refinery are 100% uneconomic so we have to block oil exports to make it economic.  My forehead hurts.
2585 2018-04-24 18:41:56 That's not how oil works. New England states (green energy geeks) had to buy Russian fuel oil and coal this winter. Not all oil is equal.

2623 2018-04-24 18:37:07 I heard a Liberal at a gas station go on about Alberta needing money. He said if they need money put in a Sales Tax. He forget about the $500 BILLION that Alberta has sent east because of the oil industry. This is why everyone in Canada must vote Conservative.
2624 2018-04-24 18:37:07 I use olive oil and avocado oil

2626 2018-04-24 18:37:01 What about the 800,000 gallons of oil spilled in the river?
2627 2018-04-24 18:36:54 So is BC moving as aggressively as China to reduce oil demand?
2628 2018-04-24 18:36:51 Right, I used to cook garlic, onion and any other veg in a pan with a little bit of oil, then added half water and half soy milk (the amount you’d normally cook pasta in) with spaghetti or pasta and then boil it, once the pasta is fully cooked add tonnes of nutritional yeast...
2629 2018-04-24 18:36:48 I think we need to wait for the unwinding to start for the true waterfall to begin. Maybe ES crashing is a start
2630 2018-04-24 18:36:45 I briefly worked in an oil refinery, and Wed mornings were safety refresher meetings. They used real images/photos....it was very gross, but it made me a believer!
2631 2018-04-24 18:36:40 How fast do we want a purge to take place? All depends on these…
-volume of generator case?
-Size of piping, # of valves, # of bends & length of piping?
-size of existing pressure regulators?
-blanket or flood?
-seal oil differential pressure control?

2635 2018-04-24 18:36:19 As Brent Oil goes in the 140USD range it is time for payrolls
2636 2018-04-24 18:36:12 ههههههه بلاها عِند
2637 2018-04-24 18:36:03 Exactly. Alberta oil (and gas) makes everyone (relatively) rich in Canada. We produce around 4M barrels daily. One of the world’s Top 6 oil producers. Massive taxes !

Do they teach this fact as truth in schools, or just the fable of #InconvenientTruth of man made global warming?
2638 2018-04-24 18:35:57 If oil were to hit $80 it is unlikely it'll stay there for any length of time.
Too many wells in North America alone that are running at a reduced rate in anticipation of higher prices...

2643 2018-04-24 18:35:29 So tempted to switch on electric blanket but it made me so sick before my Orbit gig last May. Sniffed Olbas Oil throughout the whole show just to breathe. Performing there this Monday and so I'm gonna have to play it safe this time. It's a mission to sing through a cold.
2644 2018-04-24 18:35:22 Like the millions of young ppl offered a path to pay and participate in OBAMACARE that choose not to? Greedy for keeping money?

2648 2018-04-24 18:35:04 When you take your truck in for an oil change and the guy comes back in and says “so just a few things”, you know you’re about to have a bad time

2652 2018-04-24 18:34:34 I attended a family confirmation today. Heard about satan, god, jesus,  the holy spirt, the special oil, sin, more sin and transubstantiation. Delighted I am an atheist & don’t believe it such superstitious nonsense.

2654 2018-04-24 18:34:33 I use a gentle facial cleanser in the am and sometimes Pm, and a non oil based moisturizer from bare minerals called oasis or some shit. Makes my skin feel healthier  i just got on this like a month ago
2655 2018-04-24 18:34:27 @govmartinez time to give some of that gas and oil money to #UNM and #NMSU for athletics.
2656 2018-04-24 18:34:25 I heard that the huge uptake in Uppsala cycling is relatively new, so perhaps rapid cultural shift in some N.American towns and cities is possible too? Similar rapid shifts occurred in Sweden’s domestic heating from mostly to almost no oil in around 20yrs (I’ll check both).
2657 2018-04-24 18:34:21 Now you're just ASKING for those essential oil MLMs to come to your house and host a party
2658 2018-04-24 18:34:17 She loves catnip in oil form, but when I planted it last summer she was more interested in all the other plants! She likes wheat grass but that's not pretty to look at.
2659 2018-04-24 18:34:14 try using the serum with the soap and toning lotion 4 like 2 weeks. Use tissue oil/coconut oil to moisturise in the morning. Serum at night.

2663 2018-04-24 18:33:10 was pleasantly surprised to find @PrimalKitchenCo mayo from  @Mark_Sisson at my local Stop & Shop today.  An avocado oil mayo with 100% avocado oil unlike the national brands with the God knows how much actual avocado oil in them.
2664 2018-04-24 18:32:58 Yo I know of a great spot for oil changes out there. It’s in Tempe but the men that work there are awesome & never try to up sell or anything. Plus they give you a flower each time you go.

2669 2018-04-24 18:32:22 That’s why brushing in the shower is essential. Do that & then brush all the water out your hair when you get out. Leave that pomade alone & get natural products & hot oil treatments
2670 2018-04-24 18:32:13 Because the oil companies believe rightly or wrongly that gasoline usage will rise during the summer.

The "extra" additives are an EPA requirement in the WINTER to try to make each gallon less polluting, but it cuts MPG on most cars
2671 2018-04-24 18:32:05 The only black guy named "Shaugn" Twitter cares about is Shaun King aka Talcum X
2672 2018-04-24 18:32:01 So what happened Saul? Why did she make this assertion if it wasn't much of an issue for the ppl? Why is there no MSM to speak of. Is oil or access involved? I guess I need an analyst - you! If you would be so kind...I don't know enuf & am underwater w/ Iran. Merci
2673 2018-04-24 18:31:59 Also, on the Oil States front… @marklemley was (as usual) correct.  Today’s decision (combined with Granfinanciera) seems to hold that there’s no right to a jury trial for patent validity.
2674 2018-04-24 18:31:40 @realDonaldTrump Trumpo Even if we had a war they would go after those reserves so don’t worry about it.Use some of that oil OK

2677 2018-04-24 18:31:30 Andrew, why no private members bill implementing Carbon Tax on imported Oil, stop beating dead horses all you’re going to get is “ It’s Harpers fault”
2678 2018-04-24 18:31:22 No, just set rules that benefit the domestic economies that you're trying to protect. This isn't radical. The resources belong to the Crown, and are extracted by virtue of their permission, for which a royalty is paid. What do you think the oil cos would set that royalty at?
2679 2018-04-24 18:31:21 Best thing to do now is to get something doing for yourself.
Like bamteddy. Bam with her body oil , teddy with his label ...
I’m looking forward to seeing what the others will do
2680 2018-04-24 18:31:11 CBD oil high in CBDA works very well with inflammation and is already legal :) THC isn't needed for most conditions, it's vital for most epilepsy and cancers though.
2681 2018-04-24 18:31:10 hmmm did you add the sauces after they were cooked or before? i've figured out my veggie roasting always fails when i use too much oil. fresh garlic or garlic powder? i'm glad you found a recipe you liked! i think i'm gonna make some tonight so i might try that!
2682 2018-04-24 18:31:00 Have you ever visited the Permian Basin in Texas? Right now, the area is experiencing an oil boom and it’s a beautiful sight to see! #TravelTuesday
2683 2018-04-24 18:30:55 So why is the US best buddies with Saudi Arabia who does tons of horrible human rights violations? Oil. Power. Foreign policy neocon military industrial complex shit. The US sometimes does great things but other times they don’t give a (1/2)
2684 2018-04-24 18:30:51 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2685 2018-04-24 18:30:44 Lorrddd...sounds like that oil was anointed!
2686 2018-04-24 18:30:44 They're definitely not recalled. Tell that to the unlucky owners of the 1.4 TSI engine for oil burning (thankfully I have one with no issues). If you think you have a case, take it to your local citizens advice bureau. I'm sure they'll point you in the right direction.

2689 2018-04-24 18:30:39 The motor in your car needs oil to help it function, and so does the compressor in your car's A/C. It's only a small amount, but if it's burned up or leaks out it can cause serious problems. Fortunately, an A/C expert can fix it, whether it's just a leak or something worse.
2690 2018-04-24 18:30:36 @realDonaldTrump Trumpo Open up our reserves that will bring the oil prices way down try it for two months won’t hurt it damn thing over here my man
2691 2018-04-24 18:30:35 We are the country with the largest reserves of oil and natural gas but the government that we have had for 20 years, stole 1500 billion dollars and the population now does not have basic food

2698 2018-04-24 18:29:51 I’ll see how this one turns out first ;-)
2699 2018-04-24 18:29:50 Yes, indeed TODAY they go south due to massive WCS to WTI oil price differential as we lack access to Asian markets. That will change with more pipeline capacity to export oil to other markets than US.

Oil and other resources is the MAIN reason for Canada’s relative affluence !!

2702 2018-04-24 18:29:36 He wants their oil.
2703 2018-04-24 18:29:35 Could money, arms sales, oil, and government funding have anything to do with it?

2705 2018-04-24 18:29:23 I guess there's a metaphor? If you shave a bit off your beard, you need less beard oil to cover the hair...

... says a man who will probably never use beard oil in his life
2706 2018-04-24 18:29:13 And how many has capitalism killed through lack of access to food, healthcare, the waging of for profit wars, imperialism, atrocities committed abroad to better our own quality of life (i.e conflict minerals and oil conflicts, child labour)

2711 2018-04-24 18:28:54 Today I went out to breakfast with a friend, dropped my resume off at three different spas, got an oil change, and checked the mail I'm so productive!!!
2712 2018-04-24 18:28:51 I’ve been robbed y’all. 85 fuckin dollars for my oil change
2713 2018-04-24 18:28:45 You're only 41?

YOU NEED TO BATH IN OIL OF ULAY!!!


2714 2018-04-24 18:28:39 Thats exactly why this shift is happening...where ppl are going organic, "mind body and soul" mentality...and there are alternatives like essential oils, cbd oil, cannabis and other things that ARENT FDA approved..
2715 2018-04-24 18:28:35 Not strips, but I LOVE @TheBodyShop himilayan charcoal mask. It sucks the oil right out of your pores. Like you can even see it happening. It’s wild. My nose always looks so much better afterward!
2716 2018-04-24 18:28:18 posted at this dealership waiting on this oil change 
2717 2018-04-24 18:28:16 It’s 100% accurate. I had the GM-Rebranded-Geo Prizm version of it and it’s all true. If stuff starts to make noise or break on it. Okay.

I slid into a mailbox, a highway marker @ 60mph, burned all the oil out of it. Deer slammed into the fender at similar speed. Kept going.
2718 2018-04-24 18:28:12 It is not complex. There are massive infusions of capital into the marketplace, and they do indeed have economic benefit. But from a strategy and development standpoint at an oil co, they're incidental. The BOD is after the company's interest, not the province/country's.
2719 2018-04-24 18:27:56 They forgot DDT to kill bald eagles, sludge on Lake Erie to catch fire, chemicals in streams for more fish kills, oil spills on our coasts to kill wildlife, smoke stacks spewing carcinogenic crap for us to breath...

2728 2018-04-24 18:26:57 I say it not only because I think he’s brutally under qualified, but when he adlibs like this with other leaders, he just embarrasses himself. They usually just stand there grimacing like a chipmunk dunked in an oil slick, like Macron here
2729 2018-04-24 18:26:55 Girl I bought the toning lotion. I usually use it with Bramley's Magnolia tissue oil from Pep and it  does wonders. That serum is gr8 4 pimples , not sure about marks.
2730 2018-04-24 18:26:51 where that meme at about taking yo car to get oil change and they tell you all the shit wrong with it?
2731 2018-04-24 18:26:32 Ken Towery quoted me $1900 to fix my car's oil leak. Meadowthorpe Motors quoted me $590 to fix the same problem. eff Ken Towery
2732 2018-04-24 18:26:31 I apologize for the inconvenience this morning.  Thanks also to all of the rude commuters who were yelling obscenities at my son and I as they passed by and the Metro bus who honked at us to move.  FWIW the car who hit us was leaking oil and could not start so she could NOT move.
2733 2018-04-24 18:26:29 Deuteronomy 28:51-  They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.
2734 2018-04-24 18:26:28 No more Norwegian oil money for local churches. The outreach programs clearly didn't work, Soviet-era racism, sexism hard to erase. So let the fuckers stay in 3 star hotels from now on. No minibar.
2735 2018-04-24 18:26:14 Lol... Nice diversion... But this tactic doesn't work with Adults.

2736 2018-04-24 18:26:08 Gasoline, Jetfuel, and diesel are all commodities (like oil) and trade on global markets.  The demand is local and again why you build refineries close to market so you can respond quickly.

2764 2018-04-24 18:23:06 Because the valid economic business case of oil companies does not figure the interests of the Canadian economy. It's up to government to set conditions that force that consideration.

2769 2018-04-24 18:22:07 I bet you are wrong.  

Based on research not paid by Oil industry by 2025:

2776 2018-04-24 18:21:13 Actually it was goo for us. And if we had oil deposits for example and have only local oil companies exploit it, and sell like a million barrels daily, we would rake in $25 billion yearly
2777 2018-04-24 18:21:07 I told a guy I was too busy to go on a date today but i’m in the bathtub covered in oliver oil lemon sugar scrub listening to reggaeton
2778 2018-04-24 18:20:57 Needing my @ESPAskincare detoxifying bath oil tonight #skincare #espa #detox #relax #goodness
2779 2018-04-24 18:20:56 Let's see... the "stable genius" is able to send oil above 100 USD sometimes this Summer... If I am correct, the US have elections next Fall and it would be very unwise to start a conflict that Americans do not want!
2780 2018-04-24 18:20:37 @realDonaldTrump America are ready to lose control of arms, oil markets? Because that I prepare for you this future and Saudi Arabia have also a lot of ties to respond to America blackmail. China together with Russia can do more for Saudi Vision 2030 than America.
2781 2018-04-24 18:20:32 Scary times again,Empire building to favour apartheid #Israel.
The world's so called police men are out of control. #Macron quite sycophantic, #Trump too dumb to see it. Meanwhile #Israel illegally sells #Syrian oil to the global elite so the global poor can pay top dollar for it
2782 2018-04-24 18:20:26 I want to go tanning.. and get my nails done... but I have to get my oil changed and pay bills...  #adulthood
2783 2018-04-24 18:20:24 Earnings, DOW, Talk of Iran deal, US 10 year bond. All these gave oil a push down.  Hope inventory numbers will bring oil back up this afternoon and tomorrow.
2784 2018-04-24 18:20:19 Nobody is talking about the increase in the price of oil... I guess the price is no longer necessary now that it has gone up. @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo @NGRPresident @APCNigeria

2788 2018-04-24 18:19:40 Ew  I’m trying to make an appt for an oil change and they’re already booking out to Monday so by the time i get my schedule, it’ll be the next Monday and i still won’t have that schedule  never ending cycle lmao
2789 2018-04-24 18:19:36 Service Man: Hi ma’am are you waiting on an oil change?

Me: Yep!

S.M: Well because of the car and type of oil you’re looking around $150

Me: Are you f$&king shitting me? Is the oil laced with gold?

#goddamnVW
2790 2018-04-24 18:19:34 NG isn't an issue here, propane is not an equivalent as price is so much higher... Then we have oil. Volitility in pricing- impossible to predict next yrs costs, high enviro costs, and can't ignore risks (insurance $ won't) but only ligitimate option for central hydronic systems.
2791 2018-04-24 18:19:26 Yall know that stuff you cook with i think its called oil. Oh yeah i live in it
2792 2018-04-24 18:19:18 @jiffylube made the mistake of having you guys rotate my tires while in for an oil change. Guess there is a reason you guys are known for oil changes. Now my car shakes like crazy and one of my hub caps has already fallen off. Thanks to @DiscountTire for fixing JiffyLubes mistake
2793 2018-04-24 18:19:13 #OOTT  when non oil people get bullish ...
2794 2018-04-24 18:19:07 People with oil skin!! What do you use to control your oil 
2795 2018-04-24 18:19:00 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
2796 2018-04-24 18:18:58 My sister is the best y'all. She brought my car to get the oil changed, added more engine coolant, then cleaned it, and put gas. Like what did i do to deserve this human 
2797 2018-04-24 18:18:54 How? You do realize the size and location of Iran? You realise they are heavily mountainous? They have 80 million people. The US would lose tens of thousands of lives and end up with a bigger mess (and a global oil crises).
2798 2018-04-24 18:18:43 I remember the times when I came back to God, when I fell at his feet and poured out my jar of oil. I have only ever found his constant love. His anger lasts only a moment, but a lifetime his infinite love.
2799 2018-04-24 18:18:32 At @BrazilinUSA, @ThiagoCamargo, Secretary for Digital Policy, Ministry of Science, Technology, and Communications of Brazil:  I don't say “Data is the new oil.”  Oil cannot be reused.  “Data is the new capital.”  It can grow and be reinvested.  #BigData #USBrazil #NetPolicy
2800 2018-04-24 18:18:29 Henry measured how much the volume changes when you freeze water (or vegetable oil or washing up liquid)... then researched explanations.
2801 2018-04-24 18:18:28 If we get a build, look out below. If we get a mediocre draw, we will just have to wait a bit longer. Oh well. Either way.....cats AND bulls are finished :)
2802 2018-04-24 18:18:16 Waiting to get my oil changed really just consists of me freaking out every 5 minutes because I don't have my keys 
2803 2018-04-24 18:17:53 Also I bet that Cannabis Oil would help. It would most definitely slow down maybe even stop the seizures. They should take him to Jerusalem or the US where it's legal and showing great promise.

2806 2018-04-24 18:17:47 Oil and gas industry stakeholders are once again set to converge in Kampala for the 4th annual Oil & Gas convention, focus will be on local content and new developments in the sector. NTVBusiness tonight brings you a brief on the event @ntvuganda #NTVNews
2807 2018-04-24 18:17:47 Does that really work? Is there a prayer u have to say with it? I see ppl do it often. My mom told me by some olive oil to bless my house I used it on my food.. lol
2808 2018-04-24 18:17:36 My sister is so nice..... she gave me rose oil for my dry ass face
2809 2018-04-24 18:17:35 The top 6 Canadian oil companies have aggregate market caps of $222B, and trade at a 22 multiple this AM. They can put together the money for upgrading infrastructure, but why should they?

2813 2018-04-24 18:16:53 I just want her here with that one oil on I tell her not to wear out but she does anyway so I can lay on her chest and suck on a chicken wing that magically appeared from somewhere.

Simple things.
2814 2018-04-24 18:16:49 Where does the money come from and what about all the chemicals and minerals and material that need oil and gas to be made???
2815 2018-04-24 18:16:36 @POTUS why is it that we are paying so much at the gas pumps? 2008 we were paying about $1.98 per gallon. And now that the price per barrel of oil is about the same as it was in 2008, why are we paying close to $3.00 per gallon? The American people are all getting ripped off!!
2816 2018-04-24 18:16:23 I was a 1L. And, yes, I agree! Here's my totally random and new brainstormed theory: Maybe Gorsuch's dissent in Oil States is what held Oil States up?!
2817 2018-04-24 18:16:17 Perhaps Bridich can come on @ATTSportsNetRM again and tell @rockies fans how great the bullpen is and why resources went there and lapdog @drewgoodman can sit there selling his snake oil too!
2818 2018-04-24 18:16:02 You’re clearly an friend of Eurabia looking at your photo. Do you have any clue what the geopolitical implications would be if ME oil isn’t needed anymore? Of course no one wants to be dependent of ME oil. Having said that: RE is certainly not the solution for that.
2819 2018-04-24 18:15:59 I had a Toyota Corolla and it was a great car. I drove it well over 100,000 miles gave it to some friends with a family, they drove it for quite a while, simply maintaining the oil on it and it went on to another family after that; good life !!
2820 2018-04-24 18:15:41 So you won't be using the oil and natural gas used to run our vehicles...  Right?  That too comes from world of jihadists as per you..  Q be..  Phati?
2821 2018-04-24 18:15:36 The big Oil companies are pretty stupid. They raise the price of gas drastically the last week or 2. What better reason for alternative energy alternatives to be really pushed. Oil companies will end up losing.
2822 2018-04-24 18:15:33 Sitting at the window looking out onto a front garden full of bluebells and primroses - always a delight to see these promising preludes to summer. Perfectly simple flowers, like ham and egg or spaghetti with pesto and oil. Perfect match.
2823 2018-04-24 18:15:29 this castor oil got my face feelin godly
2824 2018-04-24 18:15:24 Its hard for people in the oil patch to understand something when their livlihood depends on not understanding it.
2825 2018-04-24 18:15:16 This is about oil and dollars. Iran is telling the world their oil payments will be the EURO instead of dollars. Saddam Hussein said the same thing and you saw what happened. China wants oil on the Petroyuan. Read "Bankruptcy of our Nation".
2826 2018-04-24 18:15:00 Starfire (Hamilton, Ohio) has added three new products to its Tec-A line: Tec-A-Carb carb/choke cleaner, Tec-A-Nut penetrating oil, and Tec-A-Glass ammonia-free, quick-drying cleaner
2827 2018-04-24 18:14:36 You do realize we need carbon to exist right.  Hydrogen allows us to drink. Toss in some oxygen from the plants (who use carbon)& by God you have the sustenance of life. Breathing, drinking & eating are not optional. Oil/gas not evil @FriendsOScience @lamphieryeg @charlesadler
2828 2018-04-24 18:14:21 Sounds like you want to open national forests up for mining, oil drilling, and private logging. 
Boooooo!
2829 2018-04-24 18:14:06 There are worms that burrow through plastic, little glittering crawlers hungry for oil—they get under the skin of cheap androids and devour them from within

2847 2018-04-24 18:12:26 Dear service / gas stations. $1.33 per litre for gas is one thing but $1.50 to fill my tires? Fuck you! A barrel of oil is no where near $100 a barrel and you are charging us like it is. Can't wait for @elonmusk to monopolize electrical cars do I can pass you by! Fuckers!

2852 2018-04-24 18:11:58 Oil dumping here. Convenient given the effects of a weak 2Y auction and 3% 10Y yields on stocks. Lower oil means lower inflation means lower yields perhaps?

2864 2018-04-24 18:10:43 Haha love this! I had a 99 Corolla for ten years it had 270,000 miles on it before it didn't start. I had broken all of the tie rods off roading in Vermont and Maine, I one time didn't change the oil for 3 years. Eventually the starter gave out. I donated it to veterans with AIDS

2874 2018-04-24 18:09:37 And almost in real time oil prices hit their highest in 3.5 years. War with Iran would deliver a $200 to $300 barrel of oil as the Straits of Hormuz would be closed. Anyone fancy $12 per gallon of gas?

2878 2018-04-24 18:08:34 See "bunker fuel". I was horrified to hear ships often use oil so dense one can walk on it at normal temperatures. I recall @EastbourneAir have monitored pollution pass their various sensors at times consistent with a "cloud" from a passing ship...

2887 2018-04-24 18:07:45 5 days in trying CBD oil. It's pretty good, obviously it doesn't completely stop anxiety but it certainly helps so I'm keeping it up.

So far so good 
2888 2018-04-24 18:07:44 OH you got some good stuff! Both of those palettes are on my list but I'm not buying another palette until I do some decluttering!

2908 2018-04-24 18:05:15 Iran deal prevented nuclear miniaturization. Donald Trump wouldn’t understand problems of Middle East if they bit him in the ass. To truly solve the problems of Arabia you must address nation building for cheap access to oil, not throw around words like you know what they mean
2909 2018-04-24 18:05:04 Sounds like the menial jobs Americans don't want to do now. 
More like a magnet and jobs program for migrants and illegal aliens.

2913 2018-04-24 18:04:24 What have you got for $5tr? Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi,Libyan,Afghan, Syrian, Yemeni, American and British lives. All lost in the name of greed for oil and power, and still you're not satisfied.
2914 2018-04-24 18:04:15 Just so you know. The money the US returned to Iran as part of the deal was their money. It was money from oil sales to India held in escrow due to sanctions because it went through a New York bank. Had to be in cash because same sanctions don't allow Iran to use banking system
2915 2018-04-24 18:04:07 For a super simple and tasty way to cook the thighs I like to coat them with flour and seasoned with salt&pepper and then cook in a skillet with some olive oil. The chicken develops a nice crust in the hot oil and it tastes super good

2919 2018-04-24 18:03:24 My whole life is in a downward spiral now because @Costco in my area doesn’t have avocado oil anymore 
2920 2018-04-24 18:03:09 @IgnatiusPost Why does everyone think Iran will stay in the deal under Trump’s terms? Iran is not NK! How does that mad man talk work with a country that produces 5% of the world’s oil?
2921 2018-04-24 18:02:48 Europe did that a while ago, requiring "biofuels" added to car fuels. Has devastating effects through palm oil plantations in rainforest regions and competition to food crops. *Left over* biomass is good fuel, but can't generalize that.

2936 2018-04-24 18:01:58 Trump is pumping tons of oil into Europe and it is weakening Russia. Trudeau's right hand man took huge severance package from a US company to keep Canada's oil in the ground. Not sure if Russia donated to his former employer or not.
2937 2018-04-24 18:01:50 Iran is a major regional power and can easily block the Persian Gulf. An unprovoked unilateral attack on them could lead to very rapid increases in world oil prices, fuel shortages and explosive violence across the Islamic world. Tens of thousands of US personnel would also die

2949 2018-04-24 18:00:45 7. Make sure to wash off all your cleanser as leftover cleanser will leave leftover dirt and oil. So rinse with tepid water until your skin feels clean and smooth and no longer slippery or soapy. Hot water dries out your skin, and cold water won't open up your pores!

2961 2018-04-24 18:00:03 The plan is not to ship crude oil to China, but rather to ship dilbit.
No amount of LNG, dilbit or crude imports figures to affect their coal consumption. China imports met coal for steelmaking and none of those products substitute.

2968 2018-04-24 17:59:38 Fast food restaurant idea. You buy different types of noodles that come in a little box or cup like chicken nuggets. Then you choose what type of sauce to dip them in. Varying from marinara, Alfredo, oil and spices, etc.
2969 2018-04-24 17:59:19 Yep, the top 15 make it and the rest don't. They did indeed vote in favour of it though despite your claims to the contrary.

When can we expect you to finalise and present your policy of nationalising the oil and gas industries. 

Because that is the only solution to your issue.

2990 2018-04-24 17:56:44 ya bite into it and have to get a full mouth transplant because the oil as just melted the skin on the top of your mouth, one positive tho don't get no toncilitis anymore since half me throat got fucked off a chicken thigh
2991 2018-04-24 17:56:36 A6  My novel about maid abuse in Singapore has 4 chapters on The Haze, a really toxic smoke which tends to loom over a place. Caused by burning the Palm Oil trenches in Indonesia.  Felt horribly claustrophobic but a vividback drop to the brutality in the novel.

2997 2018-04-24 17:55:18 Alberta is able to cut oil to BC as much as BC is able to cut flow of goods unloaded in Vancouver Port to Alberta. In fact neither of the provinces is able to do it. it's unconstitutional.
2998 2018-04-24 17:55:06 how come both supply and prices are increasing at the same time? Where is this demand coming from? hard to understand what is going on in the oil market..
2999 2018-04-24 17:55:02 A6: most interesting thing i learned is that it has No preservatives or hydrogenated oils Fairtrade organic cane sugar, organic roasted hazelnut paste, organic skimmed milk powder, Fairtrade organic cocoa powder, organic sunflower seed oil, organic roasted peeled almond paste.

3003 2018-04-24 17:54:25 There are different sanctions at play. If Iran fails to adhere to the deal then the UN/EU sanctions will snapback into force. That leaves Iran back at pre-deal. Not signing Visa waiver means the US sanctions returning and that would not stop China and india buying their oil.
3004 2018-04-24 17:54:20 Y’all the car repair man said I don’t even need a tune up  just an oil change so I’m $360 richer yahhh yeet

3006 2018-04-24 17:54:04 All oil & tar corps are.
3007 2018-04-24 17:54:04 Yes. In the midst of the market turmoil I overlooked how serious the decline was in VZ (I trade more than oil) but at $75 global oil supply will take care of itself. SA can squeeze the market if they want (esp if Trump dings Iran) but we can exceed demand at these prices.
3008 2018-04-24 17:53:59 you get a photo of arsalan in the mail taken with an old film camera along a handwritten note that reads “Can’t wait to see you again, cub.” with his name written in cursive

it smells faintly of olive oil
3009 2018-04-24 17:53:58 That figures, Iran just announced it wants oil payments in Euros instead of Dollars.

3013 2018-04-24 17:53:45 You are already an unwilling participant in a model with 2000 pound cars that take up 25% of the city's real estate, kill 30k people a year in the US (just imagine how many little kids are in that statistic), cause disease, lead to oil wars.  We can change that.

3019 2018-04-24 17:53:10 @CadburyUK Do you use palm oil in your products? Also what is your ethical policy?
3020 2018-04-24 17:53:08 And you think this crisis really started when Chavez came to power?  Venezuela has been on the brink of economic disaster for years. That's what happens when an economy is not multifaceted and the nationalized oil industry begins to fall as a result of dropping oil prices.
3021 2018-04-24 17:52:46 And there was originally supposed to be a decision day last Wednesday that got scrapped, lending further credence to the “Oil States got held up” theory (on which, to be clear, nothing of any real significance actually turns).

3029 2018-04-24 17:51:45 That figures, Iran has just asked for oil payments to be made in Euros instead of Dollars.
3030 2018-04-24 17:51:25 Unfortunate this man has been/being honoured by 2 prestigious Alberta institutions.
At least Albertans know how he’s repeatedly attacked our province, and the way of life of thousands of Albertans. 
We must let common sense determine the fate of the oil sands not radical ideas.

3035 2018-04-24 17:51:04 I’m normally reluctant to share those appeals b/c I reject categorically that the US is some pinnacle of medical treatment. However, in this case it’s not experimental snake oil & magic magnets, it’s complex neurosurgery at Sloan Kettering.

3037 2018-04-24 17:50:42 How is this even legal? That’s like telling employees, “you’re not allowed to buy oil”...

3039 2018-04-24 17:50:25 It would be quicker on a morning to shave instead of comb, brush, moisturise, balm and oil the beard.

3041 2018-04-24 17:50:17 Last week, President Macron was so incessant that he knew who had chemical weapons in Syria, I just did not understand what he really meant, but I just think its about oil

3047 2018-04-24 17:50:06 good for oil
3048 2018-04-24 17:49:54 Earlier today, Added back small DWT @ 8.20 ....same size as what I sold at 8.75 on 4/20.....trading in and out with a few, but keeping main position for oil profit-taking/reversal. Quite a few reasons for this to go up IMO.
3049 2018-04-24 17:49:53 I would really put it towards changing the oil in my truck take my daughter to get her license because I always come up short on the 35$ she needs to take the test take my family out 2 eat for the first time in I dont remember when put rest up so I don't have to worry on gas4abit

3054 2018-04-24 17:49:08 It's super unhealthy for your skin. It ramps up your body's oil production and can just leave your skin in a rough state.

3057 2018-04-24 17:49:02 First determine is there oil out there and how far out then if sufficient quantity then coastal communities should receive royalties for the extraction of the oil.

3071 2018-04-24 17:47:49 Tweets all over #SCOTUS Oil States today. Friendly nitpick: the case dealt with constitutionality of IPR, not PTAB. Even if decision had gone the other way, PTAB would still exist (and hear ex parte, interference, and derivation proceedings). #IPR #PTAB

3078 2018-04-24 17:46:52 What would the pump price be if oil was $120/barrel?
3079 2018-04-24 17:46:48 Today’s activities include walking aimlessly around Walmart people watching while I wait for an oil change. It’s as exciting as it sounds.
3080 2018-04-24 17:46:48 I do use a little essential oil mixed in to the sweet almond/avocado/jojoba blend I moisturize with though
3081 2018-04-24 17:46:44 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3082 2018-04-24 17:46:43 Just bought my first essential oil diffuser from @mymonq (vibrant). I’m so excited to try it. I’m a huge aromatherapy person and I’ve heard nothing but good things! Ginger, lemon and spearmint are the perfect combo for me~

3091 2018-04-24 17:46:00 @ProfOsinbajo is the only saint left in this @MBuhari administration.

He should resign on the moral capacity of him being a pastor.

He should not allow himself stained by the palm oil sellers that surrounds him.

3098 2018-04-24 17:45:35 have you ever actually built a world supply/demand model to support your bearish views or do you just rely on bloomberg narratives? oil analysis is actually simple but most people are looking for a story instead of doing the math themselves.

3110 2018-04-24 17:44:09 Hot bath and baby oil, & a microfibre cloth. Rub, rinse, repeat and a good scrub with a towel when you get dry. The oil helps remove as does the heat& friction. Also, shaving waxing helps remove it on areas like the legs...

3134 2018-04-24 17:42:13 I wouldn’t mind seeing that @ronwyden. You drive a car you fly in planes. Why shouldn’t we produce our own oil. Why not build the Oregon economy? You use oil others pump and have rigs. Why are we so special to not use the resources we have? We are not special but Americans

3136 2018-04-24 17:42:06 Oil Prices rose above $75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014 before paring some gains, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran
3137 2018-04-24 17:42:04 I don't think #Scotland will have any deficit when we find out the real economic figures. And don't punt me the discredited GERS figures. I work in the oil industry and I know how much has been stolen. It is a lot.

3146 2018-04-24 17:41:37 This stacking of our courts with backward viewing "judges" is the worst thing going on right now, except all the other worst things, like opening up the #Arctic to drilling for oil, abolishing the real #EPA, planned draining of #SocialSecurity #Medicare #Medicaid, etc. #BlueWave
3147 2018-04-24 17:41:20 I would much rather see an array of giant windmills producing clean, green, renewable energy than to have a single oil well anywhere in Oregon or Washington waters.

3151 2018-04-24 17:41:01 @realDonaldTrump is RIGHT (again)...how about some of these Rich Oil Companies PAY THEIR SHARE for USA trying to rid their countries of Terrorists
3152 2018-04-24 17:40:59 Venezuela is the way it is because there hasn't been a change in political power in 20 some odd years, the same party has ruled it in a dictatorship of sorts. Dictatorships, dropping oil prices, nationalized oil industry, and an economy based on one resource leads to problems.

3158 2018-04-24 17:40:31 The UK100 finished 26.5 points up to remain at two month highs, boosted by rising oil stocks and continued weakness in the pound which remained near month lows.

3164 2018-04-24 17:39:29 Rolling Stones flaunted evil connections, used to go to Switzerland for the cure (complete blood replacement cures addictions). All that wasted blood, like changing bad oil w/o removing it first, pouring in, draining out. Sick waste.
3165 2018-04-24 17:39:29 Though I don't agree but Mr vinod for oil we pay them in dollars when opec get opportunity they abuse us also but till 2030 dependence of oil will decrease.

3170 2018-04-24 17:39:09 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
3171 2018-04-24 17:39:08 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
3172 2018-04-24 17:39:06 It's a damn shame. Look at gas prices, no regulatory provisions. Big Oil and Big Pharma taking after Trumps mentality. Screwing the little guy!
3173 2018-04-24 17:39:05 The President, regardless of who is in office, has no control over oil prices. OPEC, the economy, and certain activities in oil-rich environments affect the price of oil barrels.
3174 2018-04-24 17:39:03 Oh so very interesting. I am living in germany, and tried out a mix to rub on the skin for a sore hip. but maybe I should try injesting the an cbd oil.
3175 2018-04-24 17:38:55 Yeah right, it’s not appropriate to wear t shirts in Saudi Arabia, we are going around on camels waving our swords in the air while carrying a barrel of oil on our back

3177 2018-04-24 17:38:50 อ๋ออออ พวกหนังแนวภัยพิบัติก็ไม่ดูนะ ดูไม่ได้จริงๆ ใจไม่แข็งพอ ดูแล้วจิตตก ,,, ยังจำตอนดู The day after tomorrow ในโรงแล้วต้องออกมาทั้งที่ยังไม่ครึ่งเรื่อง เพราะจะร้องไห้ เลยเอาวะซื้อแผ่นมาดูได้เท่าเดิมเลยจ้า ดูไม่จบ 555
3178 2018-04-24 17:38:47 Seriously? That sucks. We got a lot of great outdoor furniture from IKEA a few years ago. I guess I'm going somewhere else now.
3179 2018-04-24 17:38:47 We were all very confused when the Chief announced "Justice Gorsuch" after Justice Thomas had read. But, yeah, it definitely appeared that Oil States had to be released first, and they didn't want to hold SAS?
3180 2018-04-24 17:38:36 Your govt & corporate media are lying to you. Assad is loved by most of his people, he said no to US/Saudi gas/oil interests so was set up.
3181 2018-04-24 17:38:09 My one comment on Oil States: is Inter Partes Review for pre-AIA patents up for a takings challenge? That's my view of how this case should have been argued all along.
3182 2018-04-24 17:37:56 Snake oil.
3183 2018-04-24 17:37:54 It’s awful. Awful. I get hives. Glad you made it out.
3184 2018-04-24 17:37:53 Whether he knows it or not, this administration is becoming a moral question that Pastor Osinbajo has to answer today or in the future. He'd better be careful how he answers it. Palm oil sellers don't care too much for the reputation of the lone white danshiki wearer among them.
3185 2018-04-24 17:37:47 i ran out of my lavender oil and anxious ass is sHAKING
3186 2018-04-24 17:37:43 oil tu.. minyak apa..? u_u 

biasa ada pakai satu lip balm ni tp tah mana menghilang geram je nak cabut kulit mengelupas ni 
3187 2018-04-24 17:37:42 Plastics are made from oil. We are drowning in plastic. It is not biodegradeable. The only thing that breaks down plastic is ultraviolet radiation, like from the sun. The way UV does it is by breaking down the long-chain carbon molecules of which plastics are composed. ...
3188 2018-04-24 17:37:40 And then god sent two snake oil salesman to build a religious theme park.....but then they got jailed....
3189 2018-04-24 17:37:34 if I was a recipe the only things in it would be extra virgin olive oil n lots of salt wit a pinch of cayenne pepper
3190 2018-04-24 17:37:26 I put lime essential oil in the filter of my vacuum and now every time I use it my house smells like Skittles. #aromatherapy #orsomeshit
3191 2018-04-24 17:37:22 Used coconut oil for the first time as a moisturizer before bed last night and this morning I was all like, *queue RuPaul’s voice* “Oooooh gurl!” 
My skin is SO soft.
3192 2018-04-24 17:37:03 this essential oil blend smells like cologne and salad dressing :(
3193 2018-04-24 17:37:02 Thoughts on fish oil pills?
3194 2018-04-24 17:36:49 Mine was the middle....thought it looked like black oil drops.
3195 2018-04-24 17:36:36 Shouldn't we vote for the most cost effective energy strategy ? Not one simply because it will make a bunch of oil sands producers rich ?
3196 2018-04-24 17:36:26 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3197 2018-04-24 17:36:22 Iran has zero effect on Oil. Supply wouldn’t even blink if Iran is vaporized. Saudi will easily open taps more to cover
3198 2018-04-24 17:36:14 Or oil to turn into $$$$
3199 2018-04-24 17:36:07 Ladies, if you are having a rough time with cramps (and lower back ones) rub some Dragon Time essential oil from Young Living on ya and diffuse it mixed with peppermint. 
3200 2018-04-24 17:35:44 watching Trump Macron live speech 

Escalation with Iran accelerates 

oil to $80 soon 

Trumps target Iran - leave Syria to Putin 

The world is a cake-pieces being cut and shared 

@CNBCJou @RonnieChopra1 @truemagic68 

how will the Korean Slice be Shared? with south China sea?
3201 2018-04-24 17:35:29 It's known since the season start that Ferrari blies the rear wing with exhaust Gases.They should search their Secret Oil tank and the extea battery charger,too
3202 2018-04-24 17:35:26 Doing a oil change on my car... It's been a while since I've done one but hey $28 is cheaper than the $120 they charge to do it for me.
3203 2018-04-24 17:35:21 Clearly your understanding of socialism is the one that is flawed. The  entire #EU is socialist so is #Australia #NZ #Singapore #Korea #Japan and many others! Oh BTW the #US is the largest importer of #Venezuela oil
3204 2018-04-24 17:35:20 may be they search for oil or gas in our stadiums 
3205 2018-04-24 17:35:11 So they will destroy remaining of syria?? Take oil...kill children and innocents.... give power to isis... leave it as they have left libya, iraq and Afghanistan....and just because of these bastards the civillians are still suffering there.

3206 2018-04-24 17:35:08 Go natural girl! I used to have the same problem when I would straighten my hair everyday. Only reason it is staying the same length is bc of breakage. I say while your pregnant go natural, do oil treatments, deep condition and your hair should start to recover
3207 2018-04-24 17:34:58 Pijet oil plus ,pengen kenal cewek di Batam.....
3208 2018-04-24 17:34:53 "Changed his Oil" sounds like that's a violation of the Geneva convention.
3209 2018-04-24 17:34:39 Giroud did this? *wipes eyes 
Olivier 'Mr gets caught up by defenders due to him turning like an oil tanker even though he is through on goal and alone with the keeper' Giroud?
3210 2018-04-24 17:34:31 my Corolla is not quite that old but. yes. it is not particularly stylish and it has *manual windows* but it manages the start/run/go/stop functions of being a car quite well despite the fact that I badly neglect its oil changes.
3211 2018-04-24 17:34:19 Stick to the jojoba beard oil buddy.
3212 2018-04-24 17:34:14 How much oil does the M760 get through though?
3213 2018-04-24 17:34:08 i know this is typical but tea tree oil and jojoba oil always help me out. it might be the fact that they’re curved? i read a thing that said if your piercings react negatively to a round or curved piercing to just put a straight one in until it heals? i do. i suck at piercings.
3214 2018-04-24 17:34:02 Do you eat rapeseed oil
3215 2018-04-24 17:33:50 Maybe we needed more garlic oil 
3216 2018-04-24 17:33:38 ตอนนี้ไม่สงสารใครเลย ไม่ว่าจะเป็นพี่เกน จองกุก หรือแท อ่ะไม่มีใครน่าสงสารเท่าเราอีกแล้ว เลือกทีมไม่ถูก รักพี่เสียดายน้อง เป็นห่วงแท จอยไม่ม่าเท่าเราหลอกรีดดดดด ช่วยด้วยยยยยย #อลกุกวี
3217 2018-04-24 17:33:38 They may duct tape, by its got numbers on it. And sponsor stickers. Many thanks over 17 years to Boyd and Gina Maxwell at Maxwell Oil Corp. And of b course can't mention them without mentioning James Esmond — feeling excited
3218 2018-04-24 17:33:30 Let talk about  chines  person  reform # white rice  year  to year  no meat no good  vegetable  no food oil  no good  drinking  water no doctor for  the medicine # if you're  a foreigner leave  china  now your  life  is not save .i beg you
3219 2018-04-24 17:33:11 My hair is so thick and healthy now wild growth oil really works
3220 2018-04-24 17:33:08 I’ve been making this breakfast tortilla( Spanish type) of sorts to bring in for my breakfast at work. Sauté a grated potato, onions in olive oil. Add meat- sausage, bacon, chorizo etc. add grated cheese and 8-10 eggs. Cut in wedges. Also can out in a large muffin tin
3221 2018-04-24 17:33:07 Yummy, specially when drenched in garlic oil :-))))) #trlt
3222 2018-04-24 17:33:06 Hey paul this oil state ruling by supreme court keeps the aia and corrupt ptab in place???
3223 2018-04-24 17:33:05 Wouldn't EM FX, oil prices and copper prices give a better indication?
3224 2018-04-24 17:32:58 Ola cab cancal karne walo RSS/BJP walo... ye jo oil(petrol) hai na muslim desho se aata hai.. ye q dalwate apni g@#$%^ me samaz gye na.
3225 2018-04-24 17:32:32 So I'm reading Gorsuch's Oil States dissent rn, keeping the "he's writing for the common man" point in - the rhetoric seems excessive & a bit petulant for a patent law case (tbf, this is a admin agency power case, but still).
3226 2018-04-24 17:32:14 Does France want Syria's oil too?
3227 2018-04-24 17:32:08 Never thought to try peppermint oil.
3228 2018-04-24 17:32:07 This would be the oil and gas that pretty much pays for everything else on their list.
3229 2018-04-24 17:31:57 They made it a marketing gimmick. "We're getting out of dirty oil." 

If it had been a purely business decision, would they have made a huge deal of announcing it?
3230 2018-04-24 17:31:55 NVM - found it. But now I'm really confused because Court handed down Oil States first this morning.
3231 2018-04-24 17:31:55 ooof, a valiant effort though. Would it work if the oil was cooler? Btw just pickled some ducks eggs...ginger, crushed pepper, scotch bonnet, salt in the liquid
3232 2018-04-24 17:31:51 Happened to me too. Over time, I've discovered if I add some oil, it helps. Used argan oil
3233 2018-04-24 17:31:50 Kim I'm not trying to disparage our servicemen and women I have the utmost respect for them I find disheartening is that this President talks about going back to Iraq for its oil, he and others treat our servicemen and women like collateral damage to some corporate investment.
3234 2018-04-24 17:31:45 That pickling in lemon and oil thing they do on Tinos should travel, if you can get anyone to sell you a jar.
3235 2018-04-24 17:31:45 According to a Stanford University article, "“Getting a fractured well going is more intense than for conventional oil and gas drilling, with potential health threats arising from increases in volatile organic compounds and air toxics”
3236 2018-04-24 17:31:38 My car needs an oil change 
3237 2018-04-24 17:31:33 Tea tree oil and aloe are the keys to life. You’re welcome.

3241 2018-04-24 17:31:05 But, but, but, this is good right? That's what the greeners, NDP & libs think will bring the C2O levels down by carbon taxing, no pipelines, buying foreign oil....etc, etc. This is what they see as good, while the rest of us must suffer the consequences to their foolishness.
3242 2018-04-24 17:31:03 It was Dean Radical Red that used a candlestick to break the bottle of oil
3243 2018-04-24 17:31:02 Essential oil diffuser is great on top of the many healthy benefits from the different oils you diffuse. Peppermint diffusion  is a must in the studio
3244 2018-04-24 17:30:56 Oil? I don’t know her 
3245 2018-04-24 17:30:49 That is such a poor argument. One doesn’t need to abstain from using the oil that powers society today in order to argue for change tomorrow.

3248 2018-04-24 17:30:27 The absolute worst is knowing macron is having to blow trump and seeing his face says it all. These pigs will do anything for money, power and oil. Watching trump read like a slow kindergartner and macron grimacing cuz he has to do awful things later...
3249 2018-04-24 17:30:21 Had an amazing conversation with some ICS folks about oil rigs, relay stations. I learned a lot. I was horrorfied at what i listened to. The CISO said they are air gapped and you cant get through that. Most systems run on free versions, license key overuse, no VENDOR support.
3250 2018-04-24 17:30:12 Lufc just a pawn on chessboard as he tries to oil the wheels of his business. Has no respect for the club. Cellino with a smile.
3251 2018-04-24 17:30:08 Who needs a weather app. I just gauge the weather by how much of a fight my coconut oil puts up that day.
3252 2018-04-24 17:30:08 I want to see the world through rose colored glasses. To that end I once rubbed rose oil in my eyes. Since then, I must see the world through corrective lenses, not to mention an endless stream of Visine.
3253 2018-04-24 17:30:02 Oil hits $75 as Iran sanction fears mount. France surrenders.
3254 2018-04-24 17:29:59 #UJO I've been here it seems forever. Its been a rough ride and days when balls of steel were the order of the day. New punters are loading up. Hopethey stay for the ride and not 10%. Assets and oil price make this ride a possible 2-300%. The ducks are lining up 
3255 2018-04-24 17:29:58 Sir,  it's been 47 months since you sworn in.  Will your goverment reduce and regulate oil prices or should we sell our vehicles?  We can't afford oil at this much price 
3256 2018-04-24 17:29:54 Who knew Vinegar and Oil would turn into pure true Friendship, Love, Best Buds, and Funny on Air Hostesses, Happiest Anniversary Girls. And Ten More Please.

3259 2018-04-24 17:29:42 Kya kare agar oil band karwaenge toh yha gadi hi nhi chalega par wha toh bro log bhuke pyase mar jaenge....no water no food hahahah .mai bhagwan ko thanks karta hu ki hamare pas oil wagarah se bhi jyada anmol chizz di ...thank god
3260 2018-04-24 17:29:38 Same here, about 90% cash. $XLI $XLB getting crushed which isn't positive for economic expansion, and in turn energy. As I wrote Sunday, the spike up in oil can be big, but so can a spike down. Definitely time for caution here.
3261 2018-04-24 17:29:24 La Fuerza Aérea no tiene aviones ni material. Escuchame, no teníamos radares para cubrir todo el país...!!! La Armada tiene material obsoleto y caro de movilizar. Lo que consumen de fuel oil y/o gasoil los barcos de la armada imposibilitan mucha cosa.
3262 2018-04-24 17:29:22 @Eminem War scars on the planet we inhabit for oil or positioning to snatch n grab it her pulse is slowing theres less snowing new species like the Prizzly bear growing because no ice for floating while Trump showboating with bombs hes throwing these are things worth knowing
3263 2018-04-24 17:29:17 Bizarre world this,would have rather seen US-Israel-Iran than the ludicrous US-Israel-KSA,proof of what Desert Cults that take over Zoroastrian Nations can do.Oil,Money,Power,Religion and Deceit.
3264 2018-04-24 17:29:09 The same reason he hired Bolton. The same reason he bombed Syria. He needs a war, and he'd like it to be somewhere he can get oil.
3265 2018-04-24 17:29:08 All of Canada should be against Weaver and Horgan. It's Canada's oil and if it's not sold by pipe it will go by rail or road, increasing risk, displacing other products, reducing returns. The end of oil is centuries away.

3269 2018-04-24 17:28:51 girls need their dads to teach em more stuff like solving problems & changing a oil filter
3270 2018-04-24 17:28:47 I wash my face morning and night with antibacterial soap. Twice a week I’m using an organic charcoal & avocado oil mask. Twice a week I’m using a Glam Glow cleansing mask. 3 times a week I’m using a rose water gel for dark spots. And I occasionally use benzoyl peroxide at night.
3271 2018-04-24 17:28:47 Oven 200° Coat in your favouite spices with a little oil (or whatever you use), colour in a hot pan and transfer to the oven for 20 mins...job done 
3272 2018-04-24 17:28:46 Today mustered oil price is very high in  market , govt give facility to farmers family produce maximum mustered crops for pure & heathy oils,
3273 2018-04-24 17:28:35 Exactly!  Unclear why those who believe the Bible is God’s word & he alone created all therein... also believe that his will is to trash his creation.

As if Big Oil trumps God‽
3274 2018-04-24 17:28:27 if i was olive oil i'd be extra virgin
3275 2018-04-24 17:27:55 One of the guys at work always says “if it were easy girls would do it” when they’re forming up walls, well he was talking about his truck losing oil pressure & I explained the screen below the filter. He knows nothing about cars...

3278 2018-04-24 17:27:51 This is getting off track. People own cars in Canada because they need them, more than Europe. This does not translate to lower gas prices because their gas is double the cost it is in the US. Gas is driven by crude oil price and regulations. They have a higher tax per gallon.
3279 2018-04-24 17:27:46 Just in a frying pan with some oil and I was worried because it was frozen but it came out fine and then I stuck it in some mini wraps 
3280 2018-04-24 17:27:42 You people are daft,did nigeria have anymoney?if it is not giving out biafran crude oil for exchange of weapon!!

3282 2018-04-24 17:27:27 So what about all the oil imported by ship?We still use what we use, would it not be better to know where it comes from, control how it is shipped, and take economic advantage?
3283 2018-04-24 17:27:26 Yes but that was done under the Obama administration.  A detail the Republicans like to overlook.  It makes sense as they only interested in oil anyway.
3284 2018-04-24 17:27:12 @realDonaldTrump we got nothing out of the MiddleEast? OIL
3285 2018-04-24 17:26:59 Cowherd blames Russ for an oil leak on his car too.
3286 2018-04-24 17:26:54 Perhaps this is what Shania meant about "honest"... we don't even pretend anymore that it's about anything but the oil.
3287 2018-04-24 17:26:42 Everyone’s talking Oil States, but SAS matters!

Given CAFC’s recent decisions overturning PTAB decisions for insufficient record, SAS more or less ensures that PTAB will have to conduct a full proceeding on all claims, even if they’re clearly valid, in order to create a record.
3288 2018-04-24 17:26:42 It follows if we think the piece to its full conclusion. If picks 1-20 have steeply more value than any others and even those have about 10% shot of being the right pick, GMs should be selling their snake oil picks (21 and lower) for proven players whenever possible.

3290 2018-04-24 17:26:17 Does your math account for flaring of Nat gas in middle Eastern light oil production?
3291 2018-04-24 17:26:13 I accidentally drove my 1999 Corolla without oil for 3 months. It's still going strong.
3292 2018-04-24 17:26:08 The best advice I got was shave with coconut oil. Use a separate razor from your legs. And change your blade after 3-5 uses (:
3293 2018-04-24 17:26:07 yoga mats, clothes for their pets, oil diffusers.........
3294 2018-04-24 17:26:07 Sucks I know. I supported medical marijuana becuz of use of oil for parkinsons, epilepsy, other seizure disorders, PTSD, cancer, etc.The recreational side is a horror, & 
 something I didn't forsee. As for the tax $$$, we're being royally screwed.
3295 2018-04-24 17:26:04 They are so stupid... Its like she made the oil from her home from labeling to packaging
3296 2018-04-24 17:26:04 Abortion is a form of birth control to them.  So, obviously everyone has unprotected sex on the first date and if they get pregnant because of that, they just want to make sure they can murder the baby and not have to live with the consequences of their actions.  Or something.
3297 2018-04-24 17:25:55 A part of me be thinking about Shrimp Lips, but i never get it. I hate getting messy when I eat, and I already know butter and oil gone be everywhere
3298 2018-04-24 17:25:55 Yes they did, Mexico made very good oil bussiness deals with Nazi Germany and Italy and they wanted Mexico to join them against the US, so Americans attacked 2 mexican oil ships to make it look like it was a german attack and put Mexico against them
3299 2018-04-24 17:25:54 I recommend  use the oil first, than use VanDer Haag shaving soap---closest shave I've ever had (I use a safety razor with Japanese Feather blades--the sharpest out there)
3300 2018-04-24 17:25:39 Aku oil dulu
3301 2018-04-24 17:25:35 Oh yeah he wants to take the oil bloody pirate
3302 2018-04-24 17:25:27 Bufoon explaining how to drill oil
3303 2018-04-24 17:25:26 I’ll forget to put oil in it like you goofy ass
3304 2018-04-24 17:25:26 as US oil prices surge, nice.
3305 2018-04-24 17:25:24 yay, my car has an appointment for an oil change that was far easier to make than ANY of my doctor appointments......why is that?
3306 2018-04-24 17:25:22 Drivers that smoke and throw their cigarette butts right after their done makes my blood to boil. Is this even legal? My fear is always that some oil is leaking on the road and the cigarette light it up.
3307 2018-04-24 17:25:22 I really need to take a nap but I’m also 10,000 miles over my oil change...... decisions decisions
3308 2018-04-24 17:25:03 Jeremy Corbyn on NATO 2014

An "engine for the delivery of oil to the oil companies"
3309 2018-04-24 17:24:47 I've had that argument with her and yes she does think that. No clue about railways running down both sides of the Fraser River. Would believe that at the same time our other US import  Alex Morton related to oil venture capitolist cries she wants to protect wild salmon
3310 2018-04-24 17:24:31 - Proctor & Gamble logo is Satanic
- KISS stands for Knights in Satan's Service
- Big Oil is suppressing alternate-fuels technology &, like, having inventors committed to institutions
- I'm trying to come up with ones that exist, are silly, & aren't just racism, but it's hard!
3311 2018-04-24 17:24:31 Just stop it. You don’t need to add your 5 cents everywhere, where you lack of knowledge. Syria’s oil productivity is falling since 1995.
Countries like Denmark, Vietnam, Gabon etc export more oil than Syria did in 2008
3312 2018-04-24 17:24:19 "sweet terrorist oil money" lol
3313 2018-04-24 17:24:15 You got nothing less for it?  You have built empires off the back of our people at the cost of our lives and stolen our oil, land, and happiness, raped our women, tortured our men and orphaned our children- and you got nothing for it?  Look at the billions $$$ you have stolen.
3314 2018-04-24 17:24:12 Gold dropped out of this business/credit cycle in 2011. Oil partied on till 2014 & it's already on the way back up now. If the gold mkt enters the next 08 type recession/crash and in this kind of shape & does the same thing that it did in 08, its over.
3315 2018-04-24 17:23:58 "If Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price few countries have ever faced." ~Trump just now on MSM

Poor Iran, screwed by all that oil and being hated by fascist Zion, the US's big middle eastern ally.
3316 2018-04-24 17:23:54 Trump saved Putin by laundering money and selling off Russian oil company and saving Putin from crippling sanstions that were working... In return Putin placed Trump in Presidency
3317 2018-04-24 17:23:53 Macam mana boleh tertinggal tea tree oil kat rumah sewa tapi minyak yu yee cap limau setia bersama!
3318 2018-04-24 17:23:48 California needs to sue everyone in the world who uses gas or oil they did it by using it
3319 2018-04-24 17:23:44 I’ve been stressed to the MAX lately & im so thankful for yoga & lavender oil to calm my soul.
3320 2018-04-24 17:23:44 Just a bit better. Stepping away from fossile energy, be the leader.  If we invest in oil infrastructures we will be stuck with it and investors will stop any progress in alternative energy to protect their investment.   Environment over profit seems just to future generations.
3321 2018-04-24 17:23:31 i love that i always get my oil changed for free so i’m gonna need to marry a man that can do that for me too
3322 2018-04-24 17:23:17 During the oil embargo, some people were sure that here in America tanker truckloads of gasoline were being dumped in the desert to keep gas scarce and prices high.
3323 2018-04-24 17:23:11 Trump is going after the oil.  Look at Macrons face.

3334 2018-04-24 17:22:25 “Fresh Frigid Canadian Air. Snow. Motor Oil. Exhaust. Glazed Cruller. And the warm undertones of Tim Horton’s Coffee make this the scent that says ‘take me North, you big hunk’”
3335 2018-04-24 17:22:22 That's awful - they need to be held accountable. I also know quite a few people with excessive oil usage problem. Chevy needs to admit the problem and reimburse the customers!
3336 2018-04-24 17:22:16 I haven’t used it before but it has coconut oil in it so I just had to try it 
3337 2018-04-24 17:21:56 But what if I want mine to say “Daughter of the King , wife, mother , Starbucks lover, essential oil boss babe “

_the Stock Market is faked by the PPT
3339 2018-04-24 17:21:42 Exactly! I think it does too, because I’m usually fine...

I just figured it out! I usually put a tbsp of coconut oil in my tea. The high fat content slows caffeine absorption. I didn’t do that, but used creamer instead. 
3340 2018-04-24 17:21:37 Vitamins e oil really helps w acne scars!! 1 down 4 to go :)
3341 2018-04-24 17:21:35 @cristalramirezn your canola oil post on your ig story is still so funny thank u for that
3342 2018-04-24 17:21:34 That's it FxxK the oil man hope you have a power cut
3343 2018-04-24 17:21:27 For the sandwiches, I will toast my homemade bread on the stove with olive oil& put the filling with snap peas on top.
3344 2018-04-24 17:21:26 The line may be too long for getting an oil change but i sure did get to play with a german shepherd puppy
3345 2018-04-24 17:21:25 Have you ever heard of Black seed oil?  The miracle oil that can cure over 100 ailments in the body.
3346 2018-04-24 17:21:21 Yeah, after actually reading the comic, I realized it was in reference to canola oil, not crude. 

Oh well, it was a fun thought...
3347 2018-04-24 17:21:06 It’s so funny every time you go and get an oil change they come back with 5 different things wrong with your car. I didn’t ask you to look at my car I asked for an oil change, gtfoh
3348 2018-04-24 17:21:01 Lmboooo. You should  see the results in a few days. You can use the oil as well, but I take the pills
3349 2018-04-24 17:21:00 President Trump... Something needs to be done with the rise in gas prices. If not everything your doing to better this country will go down the drain. The excuses the oil companies come up with for the increases is all BS as usual. Help is needed ASAP
3350 2018-04-24 17:20:56 Ya dumb ass gon hydroplane off the oil on ya tires bihhhh
3351 2018-04-24 17:20:34 I’ll be more direct for your small brain. Canada has 10% of the US’ population and double the price per gallon of gas. Low gas price is not dictated by high population. Canada is also a top 10 oil producing country in the world.
3352 2018-04-24 17:20:31 Your oil change for your tiny, simple car is $75.... well okay then..... #regrets

3360 2018-04-24 17:19:45 The Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict is taking place via Israel & the US in #Syria. Oil plays a direct role. Hard to see weak oil ahead given US & Saudi interests. If you are right we have an 'armageddon' like scenario, a new world order emerging post-petrodollar.

3373 2018-04-24 17:18:27 hmm... Bandit doesn't seem to enjoy the meat flavoured oil as much as the chocolate one, but i don't like the idea of giving him something chocolate flavoured every day.
3374 2018-04-24 17:18:24 The best aspect of coconut oil that makes it so beneficial for the skin is that it does not become rancid.  When you apply it to the skin, it can work for a longer time, unlike many other oils without going rancid.
3375 2018-04-24 17:18:17 You know we are exporters of oil now, right? We have one of the biggest reservoirs in the world.

3387 2018-04-24 17:16:39 mmmmmm yeah but oil is a liquid
3388 2018-04-24 17:16:30 It’s almost as if they lack self-awareness by equating ‘making sh*t up’ with actual work.

3391 2018-04-24 17:16:12 When were you in Beijing? It definitely has a...distinct smell. Also, the smell significantly evolved from the mid- to late-90s (coal, smog, dust, rotting food, cooking oil) to the late '00s (exhaust, smog and gas). I lived there in the '90s and have been back a few times since.
3392 2018-04-24 17:16:11 Iran has oil so the Republicans need an excuse to start a war.

3395 2018-04-24 17:15:55 Yardeni: bond yield jumped because inflationary expectations jumped mostly on a jump in the price of oil. The latter has been surprisingly strong, it reflects the strength of the global economy. We aren’t concerned that it will push up the core inflation rate (excluding energy)

3447 2018-04-24 17:09:29 That’s hurting the Russians right in their pocketbook. We weren’t exporting oil until President Trump opened things up for the oil and gas industry. Yea, he’s soft on Russia UGH!

3456 2018-04-24 17:08:20 The voting 'process' less relevant than the result; the latter indicates the oil & gas policy not a priority for the next 8 years. Their priorities driven by preventing a loss to the NDPs...

3459 2018-04-24 17:08:10 So the 2oz of Castor oil i took on Sunday gave me contractions for only 5 hours and no labor so that obviously means i have to chug a whole bottle!! And that’s exactly what I’m going to do!!! #missiongetthisfuckingchildoutofme

3461 2018-04-24 17:08:00 Is it perhaps possible that the long oil; long copper; short dollar positions are, in effect, a giant pair trade put on by one or more sovereigns (and/or their agents), and that those sovereigns are somehow able to exercise control over the outcome of the trade?

3576 2018-04-24 16:55:42 I just spoke to a call-taker at one of the big producers.  She assumed that all Cannabis oil from all producers was equal in equivalency.  For instance, she thought that 1 gram = 6 mls of everyone's oil but that is SO not true!!

3577 2018-04-24 16:55:36 The cerave hydrating cleanser is my shit. I oil cleanse to take my makeup off and then use that and my face doesn’t feel dry but still feels clean 
3578 2018-04-24 16:55:36 If you believe so much in this carbon tax what are you personally doing to stop Climate change? Have you forsaken all goods and services made or delivered by machine? Slapping a tax on carbon will not make a difference.Why doesn't the PM outlaw all reliance on oil?
3579 2018-04-24 16:55:29 Oil that beard
3580 2018-04-24 16:55:15 See I would put butter , cream cheese and lox all at separate times mixing occasionally depending on the bagel. My dad would sometimes put oil by itself with a little seasoning
3581 2018-04-24 16:54:45 The fella that’s changing my oil just told me that I look like Josh Dun from twenty one pilots.
3582 2018-04-24 16:54:42 Yeah no problem, I think all soups have oil in them just differs in quantity I guess. Yeah it’s whatever sha
3583 2018-04-24 16:54:08 'Elizabeth, Good morning, I want to express my extreme gratitude for shipping those cases of oil last night. You have single handedly made a lot of people's day today, so thank you, thank you, thank you for making that happen!!' #TuesdayMotivation #lobalife
3584 2018-04-24 16:54:08 Andrew Williams says the limitation on the holding in the Oil States v. Greene’s Energy decision will certainly result in continued constitutional challenges to IPR proceedings for patents issued prior to the #AIA.
3585 2018-04-24 16:54:05 Gas prices going up, solar panels going up, natl park fees going up....all to get us to say okay do-kay to letting putin'/trump'/pruitt's oil companies go into our national parks to get the oil, decreasing the tourist on-lookers and the protests

3588 2018-04-24 16:53:40 I just want to say, coconut oil saves lives!
3589 2018-04-24 16:53:40 So, you believe that a $50/t production carbon tax changes things but that a $30+/bbl drop in forward-looking expectations for oil doesn't.  Fascinating.
3590 2018-04-24 16:53:35 Me too. I also despise the Hootsmon, Herald and Retard. Are you saying Hootsmon that we should be proud of Windrush, bombing Syria, the Royal baby farce, illegal wars, rampant xenophobia, wasting oil money, creeping militarism, the worst press in Europe and BBC bias. Get tae..!!
3591 2018-04-24 16:53:22 The ocean needs to be privatized.

Allow me to elucidate. 

Whales are the future. Fossil fuels are running out, and we urgently need a new fuel source. Thus, I propose we use whale oil to power our daily lives.

3596 2018-04-24 16:52:12 I'm glad you agree. The marketing, at least, sounds like snake oil, even though the tool may have certain usefulness. Let's all say so.
3597 2018-04-24 16:52:02 Bleh I should wash this oil out my hair I suppose
3598 2018-04-24 16:51:49 I'm thinking of oil fired central heating/hot water.
I lived in a Leics village not that long ago that had no gas. We had an oil fired boiler and oil tank outside. The exhaust fumes stank.
Lots of rural villages don't have gas.

3600 2018-04-24 16:51:48 Insignificant peanuts compared to what not switching will cost - especially for health damage caused by fossil fuels. The oil and companies should pay for those switching costs based on the deliberate damage they have caused.
3601 2018-04-24 16:51:43 With the discovery of Crude oil in Kenya many people think of employment which will be created by the sector but that is not the case. The product is a vehicle for development.  It does re engineering in all sectors.

3617 2018-04-24 16:49:33 Just let me mix a little gas and oil I got from ANWR and I'll be right over.  Using my savings on my taxes to buy it.
3618 2018-04-24 16:49:22 Not because of the economics of the project but because of the government changing regulatory targets.

Let's put a $50 per ton carbon tax on all oil imports and see how that influences the economics of a national pipeline.
3619 2018-04-24 16:49:17 @melrollingstone Help!  A senior friend w/ CannTrust has been advised that their oil bottles = 10 grams from her script NOT 5 grams (as it was before).  Now she can only get 3 btls not 6 btls.  Is this something @HealthCanada has mandated that you know?

3637 2018-04-24 16:47:28 It's our Governor increasing a tax on oil when we had a tax increase in place with the previous Governor. It's been in place for about six months and I haven't seen any street repairs

3646 2018-04-24 16:46:04 Coconut oil has good fatty acids which is very good for the skin. Coconut oil is predominantly composed of saturated fatty acids (about 94%), with a good percentage (above 62%) of medium-chain fatty acids among them.

3653 2018-04-24 16:45:26 I save it to add to my other oil some times so I can have additional flavor on other shit I need oil for. I have also cut it up and the cooked it a little to get some of the oil off of it before I add it to shit

3658 2018-04-24 16:45:04 In Greece you would get your mother-in-law (or someone else with a lot of time on their hands) to prepare the hearts with oil and lemon. Yum.

3659 2018-04-24 16:44:58 Fun Facts About Coconut Oil:
Coconut oil has already proven itself useful and important in dermatology with a long history of use dating back to ancient times, to widespread use as a raw material for cosmetic derivatives.

3668 2018-04-24 16:44:21 Gotta love the spending argument.
When the government spends millions on welfare to big oil, Sean Hannity and billionaires, they are investing. When the government spends money on the least of these referred to by Jesus, it must stop  immediately!

3708 2018-04-24 16:39:25 Here's tea - it's not bad if they're just like genuinely trying to talk to me bc they think I've got the juice but if they're like "aye lil daddy lemme eat that ass" we're going to have an issue unless they look like one of those turkish oil wrestlers u feel
3709 2018-04-24 16:39:20 Oil, acrylic, & watercolor,... oh my.  So much art to make,... so little time.
3710 2018-04-24 16:39:14 when it makes me too oily i get a miceullar water wipe and it takes the excess oil off without drying u out
3711 2018-04-24 16:39:01 Lol imagine. And we don't know the contract. Does she get paid by the bottle? Cause as far as I know someone asked to use her name so the oil can sell. People are ignorant.
3712 2018-04-24 16:38:51 I hear ya. I don’t have much of a choice when traveling back and fourth to my doctors appointments in the valley. Greedy oil companies!!!
3713 2018-04-24 16:38:47 It's toilet oil
3714 2018-04-24 16:38:43 Knew I should’ve got my ass up earlier to come to the dealership. All I asked for is an oil change and tire rotation and it’s a hour wait 
3715 2018-04-24 16:38:41 Very nice thought however you can convey the concerns and turn heads n ears where I can not.
Look @ the earth like a car engine. The center is hot and molten. Run a car with out oil n what happens. Dry up crude oil n what do we do to this planet ?
3716 2018-04-24 16:38:38 Omg I hate myself... I couldn't figure out where the button to pop my hood was at the oil place... so me.
3717 2018-04-24 16:38:27 .. Spiritual oil
3718 2018-04-24 16:37:47 Oil prices, tight labor markets and general growth trends are giving investors pause about inflation at least in the short term, but mid-term the jury's out...these are investor concerns (which don't always reflect outcomes)
3719 2018-04-24 16:37:47 Brent crude oil rose above $75 a barrel today, the highest since late  2014. Oil markets have been lifted by supply cuts led by OPEC.. + uncertainty about possible sanctions against #Iran
3720 2018-04-24 16:37:45 แค่มองตาก็รู้แล้วว่าคิดอะไร อยู่กันมาจะ20ปีแล้ว
3721 2018-04-24 16:37:44 @IainChambersTV I managed to look up, purchase AND fill the oil compartment of my engine all by myself two weeks ago!
3722 2018-04-24 16:37:41 I only commute a short distance up the 405 to Irvine, but it’s so stacked up beginning at Irvine Center that I figure I save 10-15 minutes each way in the HOV lane. I work at a nonprof promoting alternatives to oil, so I’m biased. But the HOV convenience is a big selling point.
3723 2018-04-24 16:37:36 CN rail officials have said that it’s cheaper to clean up oil spills than to inspect every KM of track...So I think there are some more reasons for that tragedy than shale.
3724 2018-04-24 16:37:35 Need equal parts dems and reps to create true compromise and progress for the American people.  
We need to not have politicians (dem or rep) that care about the people more than they do their wallets. Need those who aren't on the leashes of the pharmaceutical and oil industries
3725 2018-04-24 16:37:34 But there are oil tanks around. I’d be lighting them outside.
3726 2018-04-24 16:37:33 Fall in oil prices from mid-2014 + Boko Haram and other extremism + ethnic and religious tensions. Growth has been sliding ever since.
3727 2018-04-24 16:37:33 Don’t ise
This garage my bill was £200 for oil change and fixed horn everything else they did on their own back And the problem it was it sent in for could not diagnose
3728 2018-04-24 16:37:26 Have you tried CBD oil?
3729 2018-04-24 16:37:22 I expected a mix of youngsters and old guards. Tried and tested no longer functioning, the oil on the machine dysfunction.
3730 2018-04-24 16:37:06 Gave my dad money for his birthday and this wonderful selfless man used it to give my car a complete filtered oil change and fill my tank. Like make that make sense dad.
3731 2018-04-24 16:36:58 Bruh all my tea tree oil spilled in my luggage, what I do to deserve this
3732 2018-04-24 16:36:46 Nahi, sirf bina salt/oil was kha raha hoon!
3733 2018-04-24 16:36:40 omg i accidentally put this oil on my boobs and THEY ARE BURNING
3734 2018-04-24 16:36:36 ถ้าเชื่อฟังตั้งแต่แรกก็คงไม่เป็นแบบนี้เนอะ
3735 2018-04-24 16:36:34 Meatballs and gravlax.  Worth the trip.

3738 2018-04-24 16:36:20 Like I tried to make a pizza with it once and I took it out the oven there were puddles of oil I nearly puked.
3739 2018-04-24 16:36:07 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.

3748 2018-04-24 16:35:02 Wouldn’t put this past trump as a way of manipulating oil prices for him and his friends, he knows the reaction that will come.
3749 2018-04-24 16:34:57 2) @mfa_russia FM Lavrov With Israeli Golan  grab, USA have already collaborated with Isis to grab the oil fields in the North where as U have told us they have their bases. Macron has also been promised bases-  Napoleon complex
3750 2018-04-24 16:34:54 Snake oil and aloe vera.
Thank me later.

3752 2018-04-24 16:34:50 I'm looking for anyone who has obtained a hemp oil registration card from the @UtahDepOfHealth .  I'd like to talk to you for a story. Even if it's only on background. #hempoil #Utah #utpol #Hemp @KUER_FM @radiowest
3753 2018-04-24 16:34:50 coffee with coconut oil is actually crack. i wanted an energy boost not a goddamn adrenaline shot lol.
3754 2018-04-24 16:34:46 Coconut oil is the holy grail. Dry hair? Coconut oil. Breakout? Coconut oil? Weight loss? Coconut oil? White teeth? COCONUT OIL 
3755 2018-04-24 16:34:33 it DOES make mad oil. I found depending on where I get it from the redder the sausage the more the oil. Dunno if it's related but anecdotally it is.
3756 2018-04-24 16:34:12 We are ready for Ge14. #imin for #strongersarawak. Stakan Branch all for our candidates to represent all Sarawakian  to restore our rights under Ma63 including our mining rights over our oil and gas.
3757 2018-04-24 16:34:09 Floridian who visited Oregon two summers ago. I also don’t want to see oil derricks when I look at haystack rock. Oregon was beautiful.
3758 2018-04-24 16:34:06 It also took me awhile to realize shampoo for “normal” hair (lol what “””normal”””””?) hair usually left me still oily but most oily shampoos stripped too much oil. I have a few “safe” shampoos now.
3759 2018-04-24 16:34:06 And with the very weak US$ the US #oil is even cheaper.
3760 2018-04-24 16:33:44 Diet! Cuz out processed foods, sugars, white bread. If you eat meat cut down to twice a week. Sushi is great. Add more good fats like ex. Virgin olive oil and avocados and add more fresh fruits and veggies! You’ll drop quick
3761 2018-04-24 16:33:42 Could be worse, you could be on EU servers where there’s more Saudi Arabian players than actual EU players and the majority of them are assholes...to everyone male or female. When you complain that they’re throwing they say shit like “jealous of our oil money?”
3762 2018-04-24 16:33:41 Chorizo makes too much oil and it weirds me out. Andouille is my sit especially in a good jambalaya (if boudin is not an option) I don't mind the softness of boudin.
3763 2018-04-24 16:33:37 Will give you 7/10 .. oil is three much
3764 2018-04-24 16:33:35 #DidYouKnow: #Cashews are in the same plant family as poison ivy and poison sumac and their itchy oil is primarily contained in their shell. @CityNutAndCandy
3765 2018-04-24 16:33:27 Of course they voted against "Canadian oil & gas independence." In addition to being LIberals, they're neoliberals, just like Mr. Kenney. Where's the NEP when we need it? Where's a state-owned oil company when we need it? Is Jason Kenney really turning into a (Pierre) Trudeauite?
3766 2018-04-24 16:33:24 เลือกผิดหมดเลย ตัดสินใจผิดหมดเลย แย่มากเลย ขอโทษนะ
3767 2018-04-24 16:33:24 Nah. It's the fried one they do for mama put with plenty pepper. They mix palm oil and vegetable oil sometimes.
3768 2018-04-24 16:33:19 I guess you could always try to reduce your consumption of things like palm oil if vegetarianism/Veganism isn’t possible for you :)
3769 2018-04-24 16:33:16 @MercedesBenz how do you respond to picking car up from oil change to have 70 extra miles on odometer? Told mechanic accidentally drove and response from service manager..we made a mistake.  Hmm after six Mercedes maybe it is time for a change with this level of service
3770 2018-04-24 16:33:11 Curious, if America has plenty of oil, why should this matter? Think it thru. You'll arrive at the #truth
3771 2018-04-24 16:33:02 I wasn't calling your son an a-hole nor was I referencing our service men in general, I was referring to the individual who had commented earlier about waterboarding I hope your son is not protecting some oil well somewhere.
 I hope he comes home real soon.
3772 2018-04-24 16:33:00 i think i've heard that bio oil is good for fading scars!

3775 2018-04-24 16:32:37 Dear FM Lavrov first one 2 dismember Syria was Israel when it grabbed Golan Heights. Rothchild wants to exploit the oil which is not theirs. 
Hilary Clinton sent emails to Saudis to fuel conflict in Syria for the security of Israel who basically dictates Western ME policy!WAKE UP
3776 2018-04-24 16:32:15 Do you really believe we wouldn't be able to produce enough barrels to fill this pipe once built Andrew? Especially if we begin removing oil from rail (freeing up more room for grain and other non petrol commodities). Especially since TMX is effectively dead.
3777 2018-04-24 16:32:09 I care too much about what people think. I just saw a guy sitting in front of the library devouring biscuits and tuna straight from the can. He made sure to lick the can clean and pick every crumb from that bag. By now all the oil and the crumbs were all over his face. My idol.

3780 2018-04-24 16:31:52 Don't put essential oils straight on to your skin kids!!!! You need a base oil and guidance on how much to use. You should know this Lush!
3781 2018-04-24 16:31:44 This is not news. News is, by definition, something new. This is not new. Those two clowns have never supported any oil exploration, anywhere. 

You might as well report that water is wet or fire is hot as report that Warner and Kaine oppose oil drilling.

3786 2018-04-24 16:31:28 i have sensitive skin but mine is combination. tretinoin initially makes you flake up and break out. but the result is great. jojoba oil wont break you out and moisturizes well and the sunscreen is also thick, so i'd say this would be good! do the mask once a week only.
3787 2018-04-24 16:31:25 The last cleansing oil I used was from Miniso. Worked well. So excited with the new cleansing water I bought from the store.

3793 2018-04-24 16:31:04 It’s not.He doesn’t care about working families.He cares about paying back all the corporations and big donors that gave him money during the campaign.  Now it’s payback time. Just wait till they slap on the 19 cent gas tax on top of the gouging.I thought we were oil independent
3794 2018-04-24 16:31:03 If you see some FB groups, you can see some folks asking for translation of words, burning their midnight oil.

3812 2018-04-24 16:28:14 They sell crap.
3813 2018-04-24 16:28:12 Most oil companies do not refine the upstream product they produce. If you're mad about gasoline prices, blame a refinery or a fully integrated producer. But learn about these things before making asinine comments.

3818 2018-04-24 16:27:41 Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday after Brent hit its  highest level since November 2014, supported by strong demand, OPEC-led  production cuts, and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.
3819 2018-04-24 16:27:34 Admittedly I do most of my philosophy work sitting, rather than walking about. . .  but man oh man, when it's rub yourself with oil time, that really brings the day together!

3823 2018-04-24 16:27:12 It's the best thing about owning an EV (or in my case, leasing a plug-in hybrid). Even better than spending peanuts on fuel, trying (in vain) to improve air quality and keeping the oil companies from getting my money!
3824 2018-04-24 16:27:03 Starving prisoners of Un's political gulags are regularly executed when caught scavenging for food; abortions performed by injecting motor oil into the wombs of pregnant women, according to a former NK army nurse; and firing squad executions of prisoners who attempt to escape.

3826 2018-04-24 16:26:55 The economic fesability of inventions that have been withheld is also b.s.! We haven't needed fossil fuels for almost a century but the greed of oil companies has kept this stuff withheld so they could continue to get richer while poisoning us and our planet.

3832 2018-04-24 16:26:00 Can someone buy me Jamaican black castor oil, tea tree oil and peppermint oil?
3833 2018-04-24 16:25:57 Technically, we are not energy independent as we still import oil. Most of the eastern Canada is supplied by regime oil.
3834 2018-04-24 16:25:52 Nothing. I have never had one. What #TVLicence (Capita) tell you is “LAW” is actually just an Act Of Parliament. Give them no information & simply close the door just as you would to someone selling Double Glazing / Insurance / Snake Oil etc.

3837 2018-04-24 16:25:44 Trump seems to say whatever, whether based on reality or contradicted by his past statements.   His spouting off about OPEC holding oil in tankers also appeared to be baseless nonsense to try to explain rising oil prices.
3838 2018-04-24 16:25:37 People will pay through their noses, burn the midnight oil and huff and puff through school, pass their final exams and then spend the next 4 years after graduation fighting to collect the certificates they worked for. 

Why does this country frustrate at all levels like this?

3851 2018-04-24 16:24:16 Why not garnish CEO & executive's salaries and bonuses (don't forget shareholders) for oil cleanup costs. Punish sloppy work FTW.

3859 2018-04-24 16:23:32 Agreed. Neo-liberals & Neo-Cons ( which pompeo is) are traitors to our nation. They stick us into endless costly  wars over oil pipelines, when we should be rebuilding here at home.   Pompeo is the definition of the military industrial complex and a traitor.

3875 2018-04-24 16:21:57 Been a very good side for that period of time but been in around top 4 for years. You should have won something. Maybe not league. But a cup of some form. We won cups spending less than the oil bodies. As did Wigan/Leicester.

Russia could use higher oil prices. France would win more by favouring the Sunni powers over pariah Iran imo.

3948 2018-04-24 16:14:02 Having done so this morning, can also confirm. Using a good beard oil/balm also makes a difference.  For volume, blow drying the beard out and away from the face before adding balm and combing/brushing it back into place works wonders. Huge difference in appearance.

3953 2018-04-24 16:13:27 Would also add that the "reasons" for mkt movements are questionable. Three months ago it was short vol, then steel tariffs, then China trade war, now rates. Next week it could be high oil prices, bad economic reports, who knows. Market's going to do what it's going to do.

3970 2018-04-24 16:11:36 I doubt Trump will back down. Lately,  has taken a hardline on  under Macron; typically, France is very pro-Saudi Arabia.  Inevitably, "lower gasoline costs" would probably lead to higher demand, which would lead to higher oil prices. Nobody knows that better then you!

3984 2018-04-24 16:10:29 I still wish we could propose a law that any time gas prices jump more than .20 at once, the oil companies release a justification. Gas had gone up almost a dollar over the last month? For what?!

BC gets $7B annually from Ottawa. Billions. With a capital B.

4132 2018-04-24 15:56:12 They will always find money to bomb oil rich countries,they thrive on misery and bloodshed.This govt have plenty of cash,make no mistake,they just don't want the unwashed plebs to have any.

4137 2018-04-24 15:55:38 Plus you wont understand what oil is until you know whats the purpose . Drive boi drive 
4138 2018-04-24 15:55:30 You joke, but this is what climate change looks like to people in areas not immediately affected by extreme weather. The price of vanilla shoots up, or olive oil, or wine. Or suddenly US hospitals can't source medical supplies, because they're usually made in Puerto Rico.
4139 2018-04-24 15:55:30 But I have a feeling I’m going to be changing to coconut oil soon
4140 2018-04-24 15:55:17 OIL very strong momentum lower now, 1H testing 50MA, 15M tests & moves below 200MA, volatility still on FULL, just starting to unwind, lots of "energy lower" here.
4141 2018-04-24 15:55:11 The system of Governance in this country is so wrong. Rivers state one of the states that make Nigeria an oil producing state can't even boast of good roads. The citizens are suffering from environmental pollution. First the waters now the air.

4143 2018-04-24 15:54:56 It's all about the money. They stopped accepting the American dollar for oil (Petro Dollar). So did Saddam and Gaddafi. They also don't have a private bank that loans money to their govt (Rothschild Banks)... The media is owned by their minions, and we can't believe what they say

4174 2018-04-24 15:52:27 Is it that people don't catch what Buhari did with that "Nigerian youths don't wanna go to school because they believe they have oil"?

4176 2018-04-24 15:52:22 That would be the equivalent of shutting down the oil sands. Steel making takes huge amount of energy, specifically coal.

Unknown to many is that 2/3 of daily energy use is coal, gas or oil. Not easily replaceable due to scale.

4286 2018-04-24 15:41:20 Wow, who would have ever thought a federal government of Canada would not support oil and gas independence for its citizens. It's not too big a leap to conclude that the liberal party is the enemy of the oil industry and, even more concerning, the enemy of Alberta.

Getting Europeans to put other sanctions on Iran (particularly the revolutionary guard) would give Trump a win i.e. toughening the nuclear deal. It would also mean lower oil prices for his base!!

4303 2018-04-24 15:39:30 If anything, this just shows how desperate the oil and gas companies are to hold on to power. They're willing to put peoples' health and the environment at risk. Climate change is real, people. Denying it is only prolonging the inevitable.

4330 2018-04-24 15:37:23 #WTI in Cdn dollars now at $85--highly profitable; stocks now catching up to oil price--but Cdn discounts still high with Cdn light oil getting CAD$78.25 and WCS heavy oil getting CAD$65.25.  Need more markets to shake that discount.

4338 2018-04-24 15:36:29 So, as fascinating as the reverse seniority departure is, I find it most interesting that Kennedy assigned Oil States to Thomas. Given Thomas' idiosyncratic views on fundamental issues such as separation of powers, that was a bold move. 

And it worked.

4356 2018-04-24 15:34:33 1) "While some may object to using oil and gas leasing revenues to promote conservation, this isn’t a new idea."
Correct, burning fossil fuels is a dirty old climate change destroying idea!!! To fund repairs at our National Parks by increasing global warming is INSANE!!!

4381 2018-04-24 15:32:44 1/ I struggle to see how bulls can exert themselves until we have a more significant correction. Every time equities rise, rates rise. We have QT driving up rates & a weak #USD (higher #oil & commods) driving inflation = higher rates = equities stumble.
4382 2018-04-24 15:32:40 Obviously it’s important to acknowledge the concerns of people who depend on fossil fuels to make a living, but they’re victims of the energy industry as well and it’s oil and gas companies’ fault for digging those people into holes. All we can do is provide economic security

4560 2018-04-24 15:17:09 I’d simply say you are uninformed on the details. Engage any of us who have been paying attention. Start here: we’ve transited from NO ONE talked to ANY Russians to EVERYONE has, and it’s all about secret deals for sanctions, oil, high rises, real estate and PACs. /1

4562 2018-04-24 15:17:06 He guess what! We supported that regime even though it was a very right wing fundamentalist form of Islam. The cia helped the shah gain power just bc they would support giving us their oil. So idiot how about you look at the history of Iran before criticizing the Iran Deal.
4563 2018-04-24 15:17:06 You realize mayo is basically just eggs and oil, right?
4564 2018-04-24 15:16:57 @hungryrunrwife That's wonderful! You seem like a pro. Have you ever tried using infused olive oil and vinegar in your cooking?
4565 2018-04-24 15:16:36 any oil?
4566 2018-04-24 15:16:34 no one is saying that palm oil is good for you or necessary. we're against that too
4567 2018-04-24 15:16:31 You mean God and my gun won't be enough to protect my limited partnership interest and my oil futures?

4572 2018-04-24 15:15:58 @POTUS I think a good way to handle Iran and Russia would be to get with Saudi Arabia and other friendly nations and our oil companies and produce oil and natural gas in very large amounts to drive down the price of oil. Iran and Russia are both dependent on oil prices to survive
4573 2018-04-24 15:15:55 MOST of us. And putting oil IN your hair is impossible to explain to a lotta people.
4574 2018-04-24 15:15:46 lavender is VERY good! rub the oil on your temples and wrists (unless you’re allergic) and go to sleep :)
4575 2018-04-24 15:15:37 So - one barrel of Brent crude oil now costs more than $75 - highest level in more than 3yrs. Supply cuts in oil-producing countries & rising demand are largely to blame. #Iran 's oil production has surged in recent years. Any new restrictions could reduce amount it pumps on mrkt

4595 2018-04-24 15:13:14 Yep, when oil was trading at 28 just 2 yrs back everyone hated it and said it was going to the teens. Now, over 150% higher, everyone says it is going to 80. Really goes to show majority are clueless
4596 2018-04-24 15:13:00 The arctic is not just a other oil field, you twit.
Didn't you take science and geography when you were in high school? Or is the oil industry greasing your palm?

4601 2018-04-24 15:12:43 It's getting worse as each day progresses. The acute shortage of skilled manpower can certainly lead the oil production to reach lows of 1 mb/d.

4603 2018-04-24 15:12:35 Fair point, rod. A lot of these oil folks see promise in offshore wind.

4653 2018-04-24 15:07:22 Trump calls the Iran Deal "insane" in front of Macron, who supports keeping it intact.

4668 2018-04-24 15:05:33 Are you saying there isn't a problem? It sounds as though they're saying those companies that use no palm oil will have no effect whilst those that do will somehow save the orangutans. That seems counterintuitive. I think some palm greasing is happening and it isn't with oil.

4769 2018-04-24 14:57:13 Actually it was poorly implemented

They rely almost on oil exports (95% total) to fund social programs.
When oil prices significantly dropped they could no longer afford said programs and cut them.

4892 2018-04-24 14:44:46 Did you know?
Back in the early 70's during the gas shortage scientists said that by the year 2000 the world would suffer famine millions would die. And the automobile would be a thing of the past because we would have ran out of oil. So everybody died 18 years ago.

4900 2018-04-24 14:43:38 Duh and that's a good thing someone should tell him he needs to invest in renewable energy like solar panels and wind turbines the oil industry is now a dying industry
4901 2018-04-24 14:43:36 Thanks, that's a lot to think about !

For the ps, you're indeed right but oil held steady for a good part of 2017 despite a falling $, maybe the rise in 2018 is a delayed reaction (or supply factors clouded the picture). I agree, it's a bit of a reach though...
4902 2018-04-24 14:43:30 If you don't get it (the price action, I mean), it's simple. People getting scared of big tech valuations and shifting money into stuff they understand. Like oil at $68 is good for small producers in Russell 2000. 
They will get ultimately buried...but good for now.

5255 2018-04-24 14:10:50 Yes. The Norway that has a $1 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund generated by the robust taxation of oil and gas extraction.

In comparison to which, the UK has f*** all. Apart from the $21 trillion sat in offshore tax havens ...
5256 2018-04-24 14:10:41 cbd oil has been good as fuck for me - i skin pick less, i bounce less, i don't feel as tired and can like be awake a whole day! incredible. so of course i am worried to find out it interacts with drugs same as grapefruit does - acts on the same receptors in the liver as many...

5258 2018-04-24 14:10:28 Naked Truth:
On France's visitation day gas prices set to double! Why, because the French don't have and can't afford oil for their war machines.
Why should consumer prices rise because of under the table sponsorship deals. Do they need ammo too???

Something someone must have informed Trump about. Triggering a whiney tweet from Trump about a glut of oil and increasing gas prices. 
Maybe he needs to consult with the Saudi magic ball, again.

5287 2018-04-24 14:07:41 hmmm check your history ms. Mckenna, the rivers eroded an exposed face into the oil sands long before Europeans came to North america and Natives actually used the black sticky goo to waterproof their canoes...

5289 2018-04-24 14:07:31 #SCOTUS delivered the first two opinions today out of its regular order, with Thomas going _before_ Gorsuch. 

I suspect that's because SAS (the Gorsuch opinion) was largely dependent upon Oil States... But still, I can't remember the last time that this happened...

5293 2018-04-24 14:06:45 Never mind about opinion authors. Gorsuch has the opinion in SAS Institute v. Iancu -- the thinking in the press room is that it wouldn't make sense unless they did Oil States first.
5294 2018-04-24 14:06:43 You might need an oil change.

STOP  taxes & duties as % of IMPORT  COST.
Have fixed amount in budget for the year 
Reduce taxes& duties to the rate as on budget approval date.
Oil prices must be on crude +refining ,NOT ON INTERNATIONAL PRICE
5396 2018-04-24 13:57:37 Liberals support imported oil from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Norway, Africa, and the U.S. plus others. Is Canada self sufficient? Hardly without Energy East. Export-low Import high.  Sounds like Buy-high and Sell-low. I guess it will all balance out by itself.
5397 2018-04-24 13:57:27 Have you done any research on CBD oil? For both the auto immune situation and anxiety? Ive been on it for a month and see the difference
5398 2018-04-24 13:57:19 Body oil

5400 2018-04-24 13:57:06 Dey said its beauty oil. .if that's what bambam is using, I prefer my ugly face
5401 2018-04-24 13:57:00 Actually Ireland charges various import taxes on items worth over €40. Also variable VAT rates on different products, with oil based products in particular attracting a higher rate of VAT. This is all enforced without any border checks. The electronic TIR Carnet system will work
5402 2018-04-24 13:57:00 According to @ektrit & @realDonaldTrump increased demand is nothing more than oil storage. How long can they continue to manipulate for? Of course if you blow up the Middle East some more it can buy some extra needed time. Benefits US/Russia/Saudies.. at expense of China/Europe.

5408 2018-04-24 13:56:15 Have been scouring my room for my lavender oil. It is hiding from me!!
5409 2018-04-24 13:56:08 It's like, "I bought a new car! Well, my mom and dad bought the car. And co-signed the loan. And they pay my insurance. And my dad changes the oil. But I totally bought a new car you guys!"
5410 2018-04-24 13:56:04 Liberals support imported oil from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Norway, Africa, and the U.S. plus others. Is Canada self sufficient? Hardly without Energy East. Export low-Import high.  Sounds like Buy-high and Sell-low. I guess it will all balance out by itself.
5411 2018-04-24 13:55:57 #Stocks continue to fade and #oil continues to be bought on any weakness.
5412 2018-04-24 13:55:56 It's not just people in the oil industry. U of A economist @andrew_leach is unhappy about Suzuki's many negative comments about economists - eg. they're "brain dead".
5413 2018-04-24 13:55:52 Oil change and I’m taking a strong nap lol
5414 2018-04-24 13:55:51 Protecting consumers is a leftist plot! MAGA will return when snake oil is once again a go-to product for business people.

5416 2018-04-24 13:55:38 My maternal uncle lived in Baghdad and Libya for years during the times of Sanctions. 

Inspite of Economic Terrorism practiced against these countries, he said oil was cheaper than water, prices had been lowered so that the average person was able to live on less than $5 a week.
5417 2018-04-24 13:55:15 about to start driving my charger to school cause these miles x these $100 oil changes <<< nope nope nope
5418 2018-04-24 13:55:13 Funny a few million to subsidize cleaner vehicles so citizens can breathe healthier is a waste but spending billions on oil subsidies is not?

5425 2018-04-24 13:54:24 I can't help to think that a good chunk of them probably think that cannabis oil is the cure to everything #Clueless
5426 2018-04-24 13:54:21 I’ve been using coconut oil and rose water to keep my face moisturized and hydrated and I’ve noticed that it makes mY foundation go on so much smoother. I also use a damp beauty blender to put on my blush and highlight and it makes it look flawless. CLEAR/HYDRATED SKIN COME THRU!
5427 2018-04-24 13:54:12 oh it’s no problem! i did the salt wash every day, and put a tiny bit of tea tree oil on the bump at night. in the morning, i used tweezers to peel away the dried skin on top (a little gross but necessary). and don’t touch it or the area around it unless it’s absolutely necessary
5428 2018-04-24 13:54:03 Not at all - since I worked there in the '80s I familiar with the terms, the properties and the realities of "dilbit", heavy oil, injection, enhanced recovery etc - that's how I know it's not a "threat"...

5443 2018-04-24 13:52:46 Has anyone noticed the price of gas has jumped 60 cents in the past four months since trumps admin is kissing the ring (or somewhere) of oil co.'s?  They don't even bother trying to concoct some lame excuse anymore.  #scam
5444 2018-04-24 13:52:45 They really just had oil last weekend
5445 2018-04-24 13:52:41 What happens if oil goes back to $110 or 20....the whole system is rigged. Refiners have made out like bandits...literally for the past 4 yrs reporting record profit 4 yrs consecutively. A push back was forming...then the Toronto news took hold and pushed it down.

5461 2018-04-24 13:50:38 I'd like to send out a personal F*CK YOU to @realDonaldTrump for not only f*cking with our gas and oil prices but the bullsh*t tariffs you put in place that are costing us more money than last year to finish putting in our windows. 

F*CK YOU DONNIE 
5462 2018-04-24 13:50:36 use after shave and baby oil
5463 2018-04-24 13:50:32 I use witch hazel & tea tree oil! Plus burts bees complexion stick. Every once in a while I’ll also use this nice hemp sugar scrub in the shower. 
The witch hazel works wonders! Use it twice a day on your breakouts & red spots followed by the tea tree oil. Use burts after shower
5464 2018-04-24 13:50:10 #USDvsRUB
@MorganStanley forecasts weakening of #Ruble to ₽66/USD. Russia's Minfin may start interventions at ₽70/USD. The price channel for Ruble seems to have shifted from ₽55-60/USD to ₽61-70/USD, while #Oil breaks $75/bbl and #Iran decision deadline approaches
5465 2018-04-24 13:49:55 It’s almost like people have become so inured to his incendiary rhetoric that they’ve grown apathetic and just laugh at his delirium. The problem is he’s actually serious. He wants to take healthcare away from Amer Indians, ban Muslims, allow oil companies to dump toxins anywhere

5474 2018-04-24 13:48:42 Last year I pursued a contract, for supply of palm oil. I have given up on d whole thing, only for them to call for meeting this Thursday
5475 2018-04-24 13:48:37 I wonder what Salaita has to say about the fact she sent complaint calls to a crisis help line.
5476 2018-04-24 13:48:31 Iran produces 5% of global crude.  There are hundreds of tankers full of oil just sitting offshore.  The speculators are screwing us not Iran.
5477 2018-04-24 13:48:23 It is also an outcome from the low balling strategy of Opec to make US fracking hard to make money from. Now Opec has decided not to continue this strategy, the oil price has stabilised. Round 2 will commence shortly...
5478 2018-04-24 13:47:56 I feel like the “drink water” is what “put on coconut oil” was a few years ago.

5481 2018-04-24 13:47:34 dropping the drawing pins out from the rear?  oil slick?  smoke screen? sharks with lasers on their heads? making the license plates spin around?
5482 2018-04-24 13:47:27 @JustinTrudeau we can do without your lumber, produce, oil, weed, and anything else ya'll cultivate. I worked in freight brokering, I know what ships out of Canada like the back of my hand! You want business?? Bend...the...knee.
5483 2018-04-24 13:47:17 Also not protecting the environment when she approved BP i strongly feel liberals do not deserve to be voted back in in 2019 theyve proven they are pro oil just like conservatives
5484 2018-04-24 13:47:10 So far so good then. I eat pasta every day, red meat also every day (switched to olive oil recently), and spinach also every day. I stuff my face with muesli+milk, eggs or multigrain bread with gouda cheese and ham for breakfast or dinner, too 
5485 2018-04-24 13:46:58 Get out Baby Oil! LOL!!
5486 2018-04-24 13:46:49 Depends if it’s palm oil free

5488 2018-04-24 13:46:36 .@MexicoInstitute @ACEventsLive Meade campaign advisor #SergioAlcocer notes oil is now less important than manufactures in Mexico, but #amlo wants to increase role of oil, out of synch with international trends.

-fraser forbes, probably
5492 2018-04-24 13:46:13 Wrong. Supply and demand. OPEC has little to do with oil prices. Oil is good for all at 75.
5493 2018-04-24 13:46:11 Kind of ironic using oil barrels. Germany lost ww2 due to lack of oil. US blockaded Japan from oil supplies,provoking war with US. Now fighting wars in ME over oil resources. Thats a very symbolic barrel...

5504 2018-04-24 13:44:31 Burning oil?
5505 2018-04-24 13:44:31 The RSPO trademark is an assurance to the customer that palm oil in the product is sustainable, contributing to safeguarding social interests, communities and workers, poverty reduction and protecting the environment and wildlife. 2/2
5506 2018-04-24 13:44:23 To ensure the credibility of palm oil sustainability claims, all RSPO members that take legal ownership and produce or handle RSPO-certified sustainable oil palm products need to be RSPO certified. 1/2
5507 2018-04-24 13:44:22 Females think a oil change will fix everything 
5508 2018-04-24 13:44:19 Absolutely. But top down approach persists because the sheer power of the oil revenue patronage incentives for everyone. People are diverse scattered and fragmented geographically, but oil.. oil is centralised as revenues AND expenditure hence the conflict conundrums

5515 2018-04-24 13:43:25 1- both rice and pasta are carbs

2- protein and good fats come from red meat, olive oil, fish and greens

3- if you want to gain volume, you need mainly proteins and good fats; carbs only serve as energy reserve for long workouts or stored as bad fat
5516 2018-04-24 13:43:25 @RepChrisStewart please explain why our gas price at the pump is so expensive in Utah when we have five oil refineries on the Wasatch Front, extensive oil/gas extraction, large transmission gas pipe lines in our state with more areas to be opened up to extraction. What benefit?
5517 2018-04-24 13:43:23 Girl u better not think of all the acne youll get on your forehead from sweating and getting hair oil all over ya face
5518 2018-04-24 13:43:20 Detangled my hair, did my aloe and oil treatment and put my hair in 6 juicy twists yesterday. I guess today is part 2 b/c I actually have to wash my hair.

5520 2018-04-24 13:42:57 Its called systemic deprivation and Libya had a socialist setup that saw the countries oil wealth pay for housing, free electricity no income tax and the highest standard of living in Africa until Obama’s CIA decided to bomb them into the stone age.

5532 2018-04-24 13:41:15 Misses the reality about trade. As someone pointed out, the Chinese could buy $200 billion worth of our oil and gas, and resell it on the world market.. No more trade deficit with the U.S. Also, we're no better off.
5533 2018-04-24 13:41:09  An estimated 175 Americans will die today because of opioids...not one person will die from Hemp CBD oil. 
So sad!
5534 2018-04-24 13:41:07 @senorrinhatch please explain why our gas price at the pump is so expensive in Utah when we have five oil refineries on the Wasatch Front, extensive oil/gas extraction, large transmission gas pipe lines in our state with more areas to be opened up to extraction. What benefit?

5540 2018-04-24 13:40:43 The original post by was by @JWSpry and he's blocked me for posting a graph that shows how small subsidies to renewables are compared with oil & gas, coal and nuclear. And calling out denialist memes. Ouchies. Poor little denialist snowflake.

5548 2018-04-24 13:40:06 don't think the two are necessarily correlated when oil rises v a basket.  a weaker dollar pushes up the $ price of oil to hold its global price constant.  but not sure why a rise in global price of oil (v a basket of currencies) should push USD down

5555 2018-04-24 13:39:26 But you're right, there's no point in Gore (or any climate scientist) "debating" an anti-science oil industry shill. Those who deny reality will continue to do so. It's more productive for people who care about our grandchildren to simply implement the changes the world needs.

5585 2018-04-24 13:36:38 It is my belief that every watt of energy harnessed adds drag to the Schumann frequency of our planet. Crude Oil is the coolant for this Machine we call Earth and Volcanic activity is a result of too much drag and heat.
5586 2018-04-24 13:36:32 I remind my students that heating a closed system doesn't just mean when you use an oil bath. It can mean heating from LN2 temps to ambient. My main issue with FPT is we do it very infrequently, and I think mistakes will be more frequent with rarer procedures (hence SOPs).

5659 2018-04-24 13:28:11 Good news is any price above $50 a barrel increases oil drilling and exploration. This means even more supply coming online. We are now closing in on 10 mil barrels a day now and our consumption in the US is around 9.
5660 2018-04-24 13:28:10 Sounds like another excuse to raise prices even with an oil glut.

5668 2018-04-24 13:27:40 Yes, earliest European references date back to early 18th century fur traders. Indigenous people's knowledge and use of bitumen much older. Time immemorial. Similar to Wikwemikong First Nation's use of oil on Manitoulin Island.

5688 2018-04-24 13:25:35 Exactly thats our problem in Libya. Answer = oil. Before Gaddafi balanced the conundrum between full subsidy (wages + commodities)  and paralell unregulated economy mostly foreign laborers. But still oil works for 90% of the whole society

5949 2018-04-24 12:57:40 We're all looking for signs of inflation.  Much attention given to yield on 10-year, now in the range of 3%.  Oil back up to $69 today. That sounds inflationary.   But price of gold remains stable and dollar has strengthened recently, which helps moderate import prices.#watching

6083 2018-04-24 12:43:32 If your interested, scan through Exodus...it literally provides the "recipe" for making the "anointing oil" and "incense"...along with frankincense and myrrh(which are psychoactive to some degree) it lists Kaneh bosm...which I speculate to be Cannabis...
6084 2018-04-24 12:43:29 I just had an Oleplex mask after highlights. Made a big difference.  I then follow up with Aquage Fortifying Ultragel and silkening oil when hair is wet.
6085 2018-04-24 12:43:22 Perhaps you're too young too remember that "tar sands" was what they were originally called and it was changed to oil sands as a strictly PR move
The term is perfectly legitimate regardless of your self righteous proclamation of lack of credibility
There is no clean coal either

6091 2018-04-24 12:42:31 When has Weaver said that oil is not important to the Canadian economy?
6092 2018-04-24 12:42:27 I hope you all know Oil revenues are rising high like it did in 2014?
6093 2018-04-24 12:42:24 Brent crude oil hits $75, the highest since 2014.
6094 2018-04-24 12:42:02 @sharptraders how do you feel about stocks connected to CBD oil and legalized marijuana?

6098 2018-04-24 12:41:46 You can thank Corbett for that. He change a tax on suppliers that basically let them add 30 cents a gallon passed onto us. And oil has been up lately
6099 2018-04-24 12:41:27 now the assets r worth somethin they don't want to sell, when oil drops or they lose mkt share to US frackers then they'll be back w/ an IPO

6104 2018-04-24 12:40:37 If any other industry did this it would be gouging.  Everybody knows this is misleading, more oil floating on top of the seas in ships than is ever counted.
You guys never ask any real questions.

6114 2018-04-24 12:39:55 @_chloi Brilliant thread. Thank you for writing. As an American who lived in Guatemala for several years, I learned about the uncanny parallels about the CIA's PBSUCCESS. Substitute bananas for oil.
6115 2018-04-24 12:39:51 We were hoping for somewhere sunnier. Like maybe in the bay of biscay? Sure we’d not have so much oil but the heat would kill the midgies..
6116 2018-04-24 12:39:50 Our politicians did same. Stopped coal mining, stopped oil pipeline, used the EPA as a bully tool to grant favors and blackmail people, sold out manufacturing to foreign governments. Rats must go. Remember this at Rino primary time. How did Mitt get almost 50% of Utah?

6126 2018-04-24 12:37:51 If I remember right, true bangernomism means you don't do anything else to the car than fuel up and maybe pour oil in to keep it running – when it dies, it dies, and you move on.

6139 2018-04-24 12:36:22 Isn't Workfare better than Welfare?  If this idea is feasible, isn't "money for something" (i.e., work) an improvement? It is less of a handout than the great conservative state of Alaska's Permanent Fund which gives every resident $$ from Alaskan oil just for being a resident.
6140 2018-04-24 12:36:21 Everything I own and everything I am will forever be covered in coconut oil.
6141 2018-04-24 12:36:16 It has gotten so bad around the oil and gas business areas. West Texas. I just turn around and show them the butt of my pistol and they leave.  Or.  Once I reached in my pickup bed and pulled out a machete I use on the job.   Wow.  They march on.  Their intimidating.
6142 2018-04-24 12:36:10 The sanctions against Russia and Iran have a single objective to increase the prices of oil and gas, favoring some multinationals to the detriment of others, in a month the fuel to the distribution has increased by 10 euro cents, finally the raids with missiles facilita terrorist

6183 2018-04-24 12:28:18 Apparently you do. You are repeating propaganda that isn't true. You're manipulated by big oil, do you get a cut of the profits? No, they don't pay the sheep well

6185 2018-04-24 12:27:52 Just pre-RHI WarmFront trialled ASHP and it worked pretty well. I helped an elderly lady in an oil fired 1960s bungalow switch over to a heat pump and she was very happy with it. Even a top up grant alongside a PAYS payment plan would be better than what's proposed.
6186 2018-04-24 12:27:42 Transformer oil? Eurrggh!
6187 2018-04-24 12:27:39 Republicans passed a bill to export more oil because of fracking it would raise gas prices and increase profits for Big Oil. That’s working out great for Big Oil and Republicans will be getting bigger donations while we pay high gas prices again

6189 2018-04-24 12:27:34 I’m confused by the rising oil prices & the rising dollar...over the last several years they would be moving in opposite directions. 

Seems like someone is playing with the prices.
6190 2018-04-24 12:27:20 Just oil
6191 2018-04-24 12:27:19 Hi Jim unfortunately as an oil & lubricant manufacturer based in Shrewsbury we have no say on the car parking in town. But thanks for making contact.
6192 2018-04-24 12:27:15 Oil producing nation where old die of cold. Teachers making toasts before  children faint due to hunger. WE have more people in this country with malnutrition than ever in our history although the 15th century was bad. We have become a shit nation who punish the poor and weak.
6193 2018-04-24 12:26:59 What a pity, Theresa May will take this serious and will call for more sanctions. After all she does not look like she invented dynamite.
This time her proof will be a bottle of cooking oil.
6194 2018-04-24 12:26:53 Unfortunately Oil has crossed $ 75
6195 2018-04-24 12:26:51 No, shift most of those 76k ppl to solar jobs. Im sure there would still be a need for coal/oil so some of them could still keep their jobs. Majority of countries are shifting towards solar/the future. They don’t care if we’re #1 in coal exports. We’re stuck in the past.
6196 2018-04-24 12:26:51 "made in China" is slaves. Gasoline is missiles. And even if you don't drive a gas car, everything you consume came on oil.

This is the structural racism and murder that your liberalism profits from and condones.

You narrow focus to avoid guilt. I see more widely.
6197 2018-04-24 12:26:18 Oil touched those lows for 5 minutes in 08 and 10 minutes in 2014.

6199 2018-04-24 12:26:11 It will help Iran also.  The question is is it a ploy to take Iraq's oil as he has often called for.

6201 2018-04-24 12:26:05 Sometimes I microwave some oil then microwave the pierogies in the oil and it's kind of a compromise between steaming and frying.
6202 2018-04-24 12:26:00 So, Murkowski has fought Trump's agenda and pissed off big oil... Interesting!
6203 2018-04-24 12:25:52 This will get hate but..I'd rather Trump worry about big things:oil, environment, N.Korea, terrorists, trade, illegal immigration, etc. then going to funerals, weddings, condemning shooter, media crap, etc. States can take some responsibility for their own.
6204 2018-04-24 12:25:51 If sustained could cause inflation to be a bit stickier in near term at least - but partly offset by firmer pound recently as oil prices are quoted in dollars

6263 2018-04-24 12:13:35 NOT EVEN CLOSE, Charlie.  The highest rate of government dependence, by far, is Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Agri, Big Sugar, and Big Defense above all.  Corporate welfare makes welfare for the poor look like an elephant next to an ant.  And the latter is what people step on. #WakeUp
6264 2018-04-24 12:13:33 So much for the economy. With gas price soaring less spending or traveling.  Oil prices thru roof probably due to reduction in processing.
6265 2018-04-24 12:13:30 High gas prices pissing you off?  It gets better.  The US is not a member of OPEC so why are we following their production cutbacks?  We actually a net oil exporter.  How come POTUS hasn't complained?  3 guesses.

6283 2018-04-24 12:11:34 Yeah, Socialism doesn't really work in countries with a resource curse as heavy as Venezuela. They are so dependent on Oil and other raw good sales that they lack the means to provide stable support to all citizens. Also things like socialism require a transition, not a jump to.

6321 2018-04-24 12:06:31 The conflict in Syria should play into this in some fashion.  Syria is a natural travel path for oil to be moved to market.  Several pipelines run through Syria.  So, any conflict there has consequences.  Also, US drilling has decreased some.

6358 2018-04-24 12:01:04 This useful oil relives tension, calms the mind and reduces inflammation! A must have for your at home remedy kit.

6370 2018-04-24 11:59:09 The Iran deal was a disaster. It gave Iran everything they needed to promote terrorism across the Middle East by selling oil to oligarchs. The oligarchs rewarded a lot of politicians to show their gratitude, hence all the globalists defending it. #BBCDP

6378 2018-04-24 11:57:51 On the topic of oil smuggling, one can easily get distracted by following the actions of just one vessel. We follow a number of vessels working together which smuggle oil out in the open. At some point, they ALWAYS make a mistake we pick up on, no matter how much they perfect it.
6379 2018-04-24 11:57:49 I think I will avoid an allergic reaction but thanks all the same. Companies need to be aware. Coconut oil, milk and flour are great for many but deadly to some.

6395 2018-04-24 11:55:44 Back then it was "snake oil". Today, it's "supplement" - to gain height, to whiten the skin, to fight diabetes.

Same old shit, but packaged better - and endorsed by glamorous "influencers".

Now you wonder whether we, as a society, have progressed at all since P. Ramlee's days.

6413 2018-04-24 11:53:42 Trump's rollback on fuel emission standards is nothing new.  W rolled back the same standards in his first-term and Reagan leased federal land for oil, gas and coal development.

6498 2018-04-24 11:40:48 Yes...I think that is a perfectly sensible conclusion. The “Coalition of the Willing” was simply an oil exploration excuse. Invade Iraq, assume control of their oil reserves, and free oil for life

6561 2018-04-24 11:28:58 Brent oil hits four-year high above $75 a barrel.

6622 2018-04-24 11:18:56 @UBS #Oil and its #inflation consequences are being blamed for #bond moves. Inflation is about a general rise in prices, not about one price rising relative to other prices. Central banks should look through oil related inflation, unless higher oil prices encourage wage increases
6623 2018-04-24 11:18:43 This means inflation and interest rate hikes to offset oil price hikes , even that won’t stop this uncontrollable cycle: more petro $ = more investment$ = more oil demand = higher oil prices = repeat.  The only thing that stopped it before was Great Recession.

6646 2018-04-24 11:15:10 Go for an organic oil. I color and straighten my hair regularly and these help. Argon or jojoba butter warmed up and slather on. And since I even have an in-home steam I figure you do too. Wrap up funky cast and hop in the steam and let the oils do their work.

6913 2018-04-24 10:31:22 Good summary of the drivers. I think the current key variable - one you touched on - is inflation. Dollar up because UST yields are up because oil is up. But the impact of oil on consumer spending will further undermine demand side gains. Rate hikes curbed = Dollar lower

7049 2018-04-24 10:03:21 Cheers - very kind. I've actually got one arriving at the office tomorrow. Thinking about it, I can always take the bleed kit to work and spend lunch swearing and spilling mineral oil in the basement. You've saved me an evening fiddling with bikes - hero!

7059 2018-04-24 10:00:49 And if there were an oil spill? I understand fish gather at any man-made structure. Therefore wind turbines rather than oil rigs would provide the same benefit without the downside of a potentially disastrous spill. Think about it.

7061 2018-04-24 10:00:37 That's good to hear. MBS supports a reform plan known as Vision 2030, aimed at social and economic changes, so that the country's economy will not remain dependent solely on oil.

7070 2018-04-24 09:59:03 NEVER clean with soap, dry it out properly on a hot stove and wipe it with little oil between cooking and you’ll be golden.

7075 2018-04-24 09:58:41 FYI: Crude Oil is bigger on the sky, taking on an amber hue from atmospheric dust.
7076 2018-04-24 09:58:31 I use the marula oil. It's okay/fine, but if I use it neat on my skin, hello spots. I make my own skin spritz, and I use the marula oil in it  Rosehip oil doesn't cause these problems for me.
7077 2018-04-24 09:58:09 There are hundreds of ex/delisted stocks that were big PI favourites that have gone. Also junior oil/miners go pop in the night! as do pharma ... these a prob not the type of stock you invest in Trevor ;-)

7083 2018-04-24 09:57:30 The U S is now a net exporter, so essentially they mark up our oil and get the profits we would get if we had a pipeline.

7100 2018-04-24 09:52:56 Syria has the right to exist if it gives all its oil and its pipeline to American approved interests (see Iraq for details). It must then take on full austerity measures and the American healthcare system.

7102 2018-04-24 09:52:26 Better than boiling in oil for counterfeiting.
7103 2018-04-24 09:52:13 Well we're definitely not leading the charge on renewables (cars), plastic, recycling. Norway at 50% on electric cars, Freiburg would make us blush on plastics & recycling.

US definitely exporting oil. Huge tanks & terminals being built on Gulf of Mexico. Shale & gulf.

7105 2018-04-24 09:51:44 Why is the price of oil rising then?  Oil prices have been (for a long time now) not about pure supply and demand but speculation. How else can u explain the volatility in recent years? When the price had dropped to 1/3 of what it was 2 yrs ago  -did we use it that much less? No.
7106 2018-04-24 09:51:39 to sell snake oil and to create false demand or can say create artificial scarcity of supply which make retail fall prey

7107 2018-04-24 09:51:18 I read he and his scientist mate currently have 50/50 share in the company (maybe wrong)...but yeah once the eco-oil is proven to work they could make billions easy and still remain in control...the worry would be oil companies buying it up then hiding the eco oil

7114 2018-04-24 09:50:22 So I ask you, was I wrong, this one time in my life, to argue the law with a lawyer?

It bugs me, 'cause he OUGHT to know better than I, and I try hard to avoid misleading people. But it seemed to me he was posting snake oil, and felt duty to address it in that context.
7115 2018-04-24 09:50:21 Oil and fat manufacturing? You moron, that probably relates to producing olive oil or something like that.

7149 2018-04-24 09:45:00 I was interested as generally the US wouldn’t export oil, being the largest consumer of it in the world. Of course I agree, but we’re definitely leading the charge on a lot of great stuff. Anyone who walks into any first world western country and expects fairytales is deluded.

7232 2018-04-24 09:25:53 1/ Oil price rise is an incentive for shale producers in the USA to come into full scale production. Increased shale production could increase global supply and reduce US demand for the product. Price drop is a likely consequence @BBoason @BizMorning @channelstv

7242 2018-04-24 09:23:29 1. Nowhere did I imply that I am buying crude oil in petrol bunks. Petrol/diesel are refined from crude oil & therefore it's cost is factored in.

2. Petrol and diesel were deregulated in 2010 & 2014 itself. VAT is charged on petrol which is decided by government.

7503 2018-04-24 08:35:02 The Middle East only makes sense in that context: The US isn’t trying to own the oil, it’s trying to make it cheap by preventing the formation of a hostile trading bloc that could drive up the price.

7617 2018-04-24 08:09:04 and neither do all faculty disagree. The Province should have diversified its economies decades ago when the writing was on the wall. We all pay the price for the failure to do so. It isn't about 'oil' per se, its about being smart. But better late than never.
7618 2018-04-24 08:08:56 Buhari miss the point  this time, by calling the Nigerian youths lazy people who only wants free oil money, but here comes 2019. By then we shall who is lazy!

7620 2018-04-24 08:08:51 @nadiakhomami Hey.  I liked your fatberg autopsy article.  I've been wondering, am I cooking the right way to help with this problem?  I'm not just dumping oil down the sink, but how much is too much, when I'm cleaning up from dinner?  What else could I do? Thanks!
7621 2018-04-24 08:08:01 I LOVE it, I think I prefer it to vego and no palm oil too.
7622 2018-04-24 08:07:27 Yes. You might want to use alternatives to make the equipment salvageable, but if you don't care about that, water is fine. I think the one big exception is high voltage oil filled transformers.

7628 2018-04-24 08:05:55 An oil story. Strange that the price being 75 a barrel against a production cost of 14 was nog thd story.  Every time price dropped in 2014 it led the news.
7629 2018-04-24 08:05:51 See how virtuous it is when we have to buy more oil and gas from overseas

7632 2018-04-24 08:04:37 A lot of US taxpayer and UK taxpayer money is spent paying the White Helmets armies to secure the oil routes in Syria for the big multinational corporations. While they keep the peasants occupied with hard labor, drunk with beer, and glued into football on TV.

7671 2018-04-24 07:53:47 "Data is the new oil" is a phrase often heard in our world of late. Repeated again by Audi just now. This is a loaded statement, and those who use it don't seem to understand the implications. #kafkasummit
7672 2018-04-24 07:53:21 I guess oil has lost the relevant role it had 40 years ago...

7686 2018-04-24 07:50:22 America must build more solar and wind power stations and electric energy storage facilities and renew the grid in order not to fall behind. Look at the Chinese and Germans what they are doing. Oil, gas and coal are to valuable to be just burnt.
7687 2018-04-24 07:50:04 Then you probably have a Dukla Prague away top in your wardrobe and beard oil in your bathroom cabinet.
7688 2018-04-24 07:49:36 Oil Prices gave up earlier declines to settle higher, as reports that a Saudi-led air strike killed the head of the Houthi rebels in Yemen raised the potential for disruptions to the flow of crude in the Middle East.

Herdsmen are slashing people's throats here and our government is rubbing them on the heads with anointing oil.

8042 2018-04-24 06:33:39 That's about the level of analysis in @nzlabour 's policy. None at all. Green energy can never bridge gap over this time frame - do your research - with no gas, at half the emissions of coal, world just burns more oil. This ends in costly, unreliable power, as in NSW and Germany.
8043 2018-04-24 06:32:58 Of a truth #TotalMustDoRight this bullying by oil companies in Nigeria and the evil Government that we have doesn't care about the people. This is height of wickedness and must fought to stop.
8044 2018-04-24 06:32:55 palm oil is not a native Asia Pacific plant but big corporations and governments are promoting it as an economic  growth over the importance of natural biodiversity . 

there is no planet b . stop deforestation
8045 2018-04-24 06:32:42 Here's a thought: take all the energy you all have for the Bernie/Hillary/Trump fiasco that this country is currently being subjected to & find a legit candidate who can rep all, not just being a smooth talker,  backroom dealer, snake oil salesman. Might accomplish alot more. jat

8074 2018-04-24 06:26:07 I noticed a lot of policy overlap. It took me a while to learn the name of what I was observing and that name is centrism and it's a sterile name for a very ugly concept. But, yes GW and Obama seem very charming while being very deadly in oil rich nations.

8118 2018-04-24 06:18:50 Current currency shortage in ATMS may be a deliberate act of desperation.  Through this cash shortage, Jaitley team hopes to contain depreciation of INR and control inflation ( both of which is  under pressure due to increasing import costs of Crude Oil, and falling exports).

8134 2018-04-24 06:14:41 Except inequality has risen over that period of time. When royalties on oil and gas extraction were higher I would think you may have had a point. But now the royalties are pitifully low and government subsidization is on the rise. It’s costing us - fiscally & environmentally.

8141 2018-04-24 06:13:25 Yes that is true, Israel looting Syria oil. Golan Heights is legally Syria. But there are other competing pipelines too to get rid of EU depependency of Russian energy. Kurds looting Iraqi oil, isis oil trade. Complicated mesh of competition and looting

8181 2018-04-24 06:05:00 No, nothing like clean coal, as there is 0 % of crude oil used in the production of renewable diesel. Our renewable diesel is produced 100 % from renewable raw materials, such as wastes and residues.

8258 2018-04-24 05:49:13 Who knew putting your cousin in charge of the country’s oil industry just because he changed the oil in his car once would be a bad idea? 

Socialism, not even once!
8259 2018-04-24 05:49:09 ERC also plays the same game with fuel prices. Mara global crude oil price. Mara it's the dollar. Mara it's the formulae. Curses are real.. cc @KenyaPower_Care @energy_ke

8262 2018-04-24 05:48:58 Yes, what I meant was, even w/ only the info available at the time, ETH's ICO had much more substance/less snake oil than most 2017-18 ICOs.
8263 2018-04-24 05:48:42 The notion that oil can be sold for a decent profit in today’s market is a joke. Alberta bitumen is and always will be an inferior product on the world energy market and will always be priced as such.
8264 2018-04-24 05:48:24 Lol are you serious Ardern dominating everything. Funny. Even her most ardent reporter supporters are sticking in the boot. The public see the labour youth camp, the Middlemore Hospital , the oil and gas , all the rest of it RNZ debarcle as evidence of incompetence
8265 2018-04-24 05:48:20 Yes! This is a very big opportunity for the students to learn and get as much as they can from okomu oil. 

When the industry meets higher education.... there is so much as we can achieve as a nation especially with our undoubted huge natural resources.
8266 2018-04-24 05:48:15 I am in full agreement with you. See the status of Palm oil case in which late Mr. K .Karunakaran was an accused. The loss to the state is estimated to be above 1 crore. More than that has been spent for the enquiry procedure etc.
8267 2018-04-24 05:48:09 Congress party and his leadership not speaking for patrol  and oil prices but all time speaking useless matter
8268 2018-04-24 05:47:57 It's not like he will force OPEC to lower the prices against it well. Just unleash American oil and allow it to export more crude oil. No one is interfering here.

8276 2018-04-24 05:45:58 Extra-virgin olive oil gets sediment after cold storage.  Shake it up, leave it at room temperature for a day - bingo !  Clear oil again.   Try keeping it away from cold if you want it to remain clear.

8315 2018-04-24 05:40:06 By this reasoning, burning coal, oil, and natural gas is "carbon neutral." Eventually that carbon will be absorbed by plant & animal life, which will die and anaerobically decompose over millennia into more coal, oil, & natural gas. Ergo, fossil fuels are a renewable resource.
8316 2018-04-24 05:39:52 @AJStream d major cause of the #soot is as a result of illegal refineries, d petrol chemicals are also contributors. D security agencies should do more to secure our pipelines and guide against oil theft. Let there be a capital punishment energy theft. #StopTheSoot
8317 2018-04-24 05:39:39 Conservatives and Trump supporters. Beware. International corporations and certain countries are manipulating oil prices higher and the Federal Reserve is moving interest rates higher. All of this to crash our economy late this summer before the elections.

8343 2018-04-24 05:31:58 Yes. Slowly but surely they're westernizing because when the oil stops and they can't give everyone a free petrodollar state, they need an economy of some sort, and they can't make it function with just men. So begrudgingly, I guess?

8404 2018-04-24 05:20:36 Your pathetic shilling for oil companies or the short sellers is futile. So give it a rest.

Just like the 5 wise virgin who had extra oil, its important to save more just in case you will need more. Having just exactly what you need is being short sighted, myopic and shallow minded.

8428 2018-04-24 05:15:56 Did it myself. It's really easy. Its sea salt, black pepper, olive oil, and a little garlic powder. I can eat it everyday and technically I do almost half the time.

8535 2018-04-24 04:59:42 We have been doing just that, right? Paying for Iranian oil in rupees....but i dont think we prefer that since it becomes extremely complex with no flexibility....its easier to trade in euros or dollars. We were forced to pay in rupees due to the sanctions.

8539 2018-04-24 04:58:50 Roses have the highest energy of all flowers. One can use a spritzer kind of spray with essential oil of rose to help to balance one's energy. My friend used to keep one in his car to counteract the stress of driving. Thank you for sharing.
8540 2018-04-24 04:58:33 god chicken nuggets are horrible, my stomach is hurting from its dumb amount of oil it dropped off when cooking and its taste while being a pain in the belly
8541 2018-04-24 04:58:30 At such a time Why not ethanol price should linked to international crude oil prices instead of sugar cane price . Virtually it replaced and reduce procurement of crude oil so logical also.

But PS: do make sure you get some sleep. It’s like oil in a car. Food is gas, but with no oil it won’t run properly and you fuck up the car.

8562 2018-04-24 04:54:55 I think it's about time the oil industry pay pro sports leagues an integrity fee.  How many gallons of gas are consumed yearly by people driving to and from sporting events? This insanity must stop
8563 2018-04-24 04:54:20 If you guys go to the same one i went to with tracie george and blair then youre good. Be careful w/ extra butter when its the canola oil. You can feel pretty shit afterwords. Also lmk if you go to a cinemark I can get you guys a discount :D

8578 2018-04-24 04:51:02 Foreign oil gasholes still dangling their copper trinkets. Why doesn't Alberta use all the oil royalties you've earned to diversify your economy?

8581 2018-04-24 04:50:36 There is a lot more money in oil and gas than in climate research by a factor of one million. They pay PR comanies to publish articles to discredit climate science.

8592 2018-04-24 04:48:20 Im no doctor but I don't think cannabis oil should be going near your eye
8593 2018-04-24 04:48:16 It's not just VAT that went up. There's the oil price, the fuel levy, sin tax and sugar tax – just that I know of – that went up. Not to mention prices do go up every year. The VAT increase is negligible and almost inconsequential.
8594 2018-04-24 04:48:13 Amazing, with oil at 70 dollars a barrel. Wow.

8603 2018-04-24 04:46:32 My dog freaks out horribly during car rides, I would be torn in this situation too. If it were me, I'd go grab some coconut oil and feed it to her to see if it helps her poop. If she hasn't in the next couple of hours, then it might be time to head to the 24hr vet. Hang in there.

8623 2018-04-24 04:42:34 It had been there but due to the sanctions and external pressure we backed out from the INR denominated trade with IRAN, now on the backdrop of strained relations of IRAN and US will the oil import from Iran materialize?

8677 2018-04-24 04:33:34 Nobody "embodies" science, and he is not an eco-terrorist. That is Rebel talk--i.e., extremist. The oil and gas companies need to understand that are legitimate differences of opinion about what should be extracted v. alternatives.

8679 2018-04-24 04:32:06 #Iran's oil minister hints at possible discounts : "To sell [our oil], we may resort to using certain pricing policies, going forward, to maintain our place in the oil market."

Time to restart barter system with Iran. They buy Indian Products in Rupee,  we buy oil in Rupee.
8680 2018-04-24 04:32:04 Lmao Joe Ingles really out here BALLIN’ while looking like a small town mechanic that only know how to change ya oil in ya car
8681 2018-04-24 04:31:42 Mmhmm. I like the idea of developing renewable fuels... But in the meantime, we need cleaner transportation for fossil fuels (pipelines) as well as cleaner uses. There's a lot of stuff that still can only use & be made with oil. It'll be a while before we can change that. :-)
8682 2018-04-24 04:31:36 The move was expected because the country’s state-owned oil company had fallen behind on paying its bills from companies that maintain and operate its oil and gas wells.

I don't think we had this monster of terrorism so big if it was not US to attack Kuwait Iraq for having authority on oil only

8701 2018-04-24 04:28:43 The body bags will continue just like Afghanistan, Iraq...are you sending your kid to die in the next war for OIL? AMERICA is a broken record.
8702 2018-04-24 04:28:21 Ever thought about getting a “SAD” lamp? I got one for the “winter” and used it for an hour every day. Not sure if it truly helped or if it’s some snake oil hippy dippy shit, but it might help some?

8721 2018-04-24 04:24:01 Good , because people in Kentucky were sending him messages to support him. I do not think we should still support these wars. Get out of them. Let them spend there money or take the oil.

8765 2018-04-24 04:16:59 Either way it’s because oil isn’t like water so chemically it needs to be exposed to oxygen more in order to dry faster. Also thickness and room temp matters. I forgot what my professor had us put our paintings in, but it dried in like 8 hours
8766 2018-04-24 04:16:56 One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’

8821 2018-04-24 04:09:31 We never really see Big Foot shot from the same angle. He’s crooked. We’re looking up at him. He’s looking down at us. For sure. There weren’t oil fields or brilliant spiral staircases, but he made other things visually interesting.
8822 2018-04-24 04:09:17 Look at the history of North Korea. This is what they do when sanctions get tough. They’ll agree to anything. Just wait for what they ask for in return. Trump is no miracle worker. He’s a snake oil salesman.

Clearly there’s no lynch mob against environmentalists.
8851 2018-04-24 04:03:47 You must be REALLY angry at Trump then, conservative. He's selling you snake oil & stiffing you like you are one of his contractors WHEN he did a little construction before he could only be a brand.

8894 2018-04-24 03:58:37 I think you’re being equivocal.

There’s a vast difference between “don’t support oil and gas” and Suzuki’s brand of “resource extraction is a crime against humanity”.

Criticism of the latter is not the same as against the former.
8895 2018-04-24 03:58:07 Faux dairy-like product?  They are much more vegetable oil than anything else.
8896 2018-04-24 03:58:06 also consider the scent aspect of the oil. you can look to traditional holy oil recipes and essential oils (as an additive) for ideas of things you can use to engineer your own signature oil scent.

8899 2018-04-24 03:57:38 What are you using? The only things I like from them are the glycolic toner and rose hip oil and sometimes the hyaluronic acid, but I agree. I’d rather buy one product I love that costs $50 than 5 of their products.

8908 2018-04-24 03:56:21 Haha, my response would be tell me about the trend of the Canadian Dollar to the Russian Ruble, if oil prices stay constant,  yet the North American economy slows down due to Ontario housing bubble,  and rising consumer prices in the US

8911 2018-04-24 03:55:46 Instead of improving the job crisis as promised by the Government they had worsened in four years.
The Govt has attributed the latest hike in petrol prices although the crude oil price have witnessed a steady decline.
What could be the greater indictment of the BJP Government.
8912 2018-04-24 03:55:44 7....the oil price three times in a row from Rp.6000 to Rp.4500. But at the same time, oddly enough, Pertamina never has to face the music either that the cupboard is bare is or that it at least has to run on a shoestring.

8918 2018-04-24 03:54:47 It threatens academic integrity in real serious ways.

There ARE professors and researchers and students on campus at the university of Alberta who don't support oil & gas.

This dean's message says they don't belong and that their ideas are unworthy.
8919 2018-04-24 03:54:35 I went to a dermatologist! Along with that even after being done with my medication, I washed my face with cetaphil or the st Ives apricot scrub. And every morning/evening I use tea tree oil as a spot treatment as well as moisturizing!

8934 2018-04-24 03:51:58 Professors can feel and say whatever they like in their own time,  on their own social media accounts but is irresponsible for a publicly funded institution to officially state that they won't do anything to offend the oil & gas sector, which is what that dean did.

8941 2018-04-24 03:51:06 Please stop this divisive narrative, and look at how we can work together to fix our dependence on oil. Because you know what? The more you speak divisively and the more you play into this narrative, the more that Jason Effin' Kenney will be the next premier
8942 2018-04-24 03:51:02 Who were the Charlatans? Because if anyone was selling snake oil it was Hillary.
8943 2018-04-24 03:50:49 I'm not big on them either, but I think if we end oil subsidies (why the hell do oil companies need subsidies??) we can pay for them that way.  This is about as far as I'm willing to go when it comes to providing financial incentives to do the right thing.  That said, homeowners

8949 2018-04-24 03:50:11 They're more obsessed with oil than the United States. It was discovered that Somalia's land/coastline is sitting on top of one of the largest oil reserve in the continent of Africa. Hence why countries keep trying to come up with excuses to go to war with Somalia.

Think of it, if our world's best finance minister has even given her wink to increase the budget for oil prices until next year, why did Elia Massa Manik think he had to be a hero to have had swum against the tide at the expense of his own career? That just don't make sense.

8971 2018-04-24 03:47:20 I agree with Mr Baliga. When oil was below $40, the govt commentary for high taxes was to offset future potential spikes. How much more of a spike is the govt awaiting to roll back the taxes and bring in GST or is oil a SIN item?

9008 2018-04-24 03:42:18 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

9044 2018-04-24 03:38:04 Research dry scrubs! It’s supposed to be good for blood circulation and what not, all it is essentially is scrubbing your body with a soft brush with no added water, I usually use baby oil and scrub around for a bit and THEN shower and do the same
9045 2018-04-24 03:38:00 As far as I can see most “smart city” stuff in NZ is snake oil or fluff. Don’t have scale to justify it or means to act on it. Meanwhile we can’t get “dumb city” stuff right.
9046 2018-04-24 03:37:55 after I saw oil sheen....I laughed

9087 2018-04-24 03:32:21 I have changed seats on the train for perfume, cologne, body lotion, even hairspray or hair oil. (Patchouli needs to die.) I  feel bad doing it, bc I know the wearers don't mean to make me ill, but my eyes water and I start sneezing.
9088 2018-04-24 03:32:16 @RareLtd this company needs some love and attention. 1st RC Pro am left me a frustrated 9 yr old after an oil slick. 2nd Battletoads made me cool in the neighborhood. 3rd Golden Eye 007 do I really need to go there? That will go down as a one of the best games ever.

9094 2018-04-24 03:31:02 America has not always been first world! Traveling through South America I was amazed at the natural resources! It has it all, oil, mining, timber, fishing, rubber, nut trees, olives, farming, beef, wool and much more? But the people were not working?

9123 2018-04-24 03:25:59 Makes sense, actually. The Alberta energy industry already has some PR work to do to remind the world of our clean, democratic, Canadian oil. Associating with the drug money launderers at @HSBC_CA is bad for our reputation.

Good riddance.

9131 2018-04-24 03:23:37 - peach oil is good, you can't go wrong with any of them
- melted latex is bad

- melted matte (felt tip tubes) are underwhelming

9150 2018-04-24 03:21:20 How the leafs do has nothing to do with how bad the Oil look. The Oil are a result of their own poor decisions and management. You shouldn’t want Leafs to do well strictly bc of Leaf fans.

9169 2018-04-24 03:18:29 Oven 400, sprinkle chili powder, salt, pepper. Drizzle olive oil. Bake for 20 mins(ish) until squishy and somewhat brown. Then put Parmesan on them 
9170 2018-04-24 03:18:27 Oil companies don't like it. So it's a non-starter with Republicans...

9333 2018-04-24 02:56:15 It's not about owning the oil.... it's about controlling it. He who controls the oil, controls the world because you can control the energy of the Nations. You can economically destroy a country by cutting off oil to it.. Like we did to Japan.

9362 2018-04-24 02:52:21 My partner is 1/4 Italian, but just managed to destroy a subtle pasta dish with tender chicken and sautéed veggies I started cooking (and he finished) by dousing the whole meal in yellow onion and random red sauce, neither of which I’d gotten out.

It only needed olive oil. 
9363 2018-04-24 02:52:13 授業中だから行けないよ
9364 2018-04-24 02:52:06 It's 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes (I think I did 18). Just spread 'em out on a cookie sheet, cover with olive oil, salt, and a bit of sesame oil (a little goes a long way) and bake :)
9365 2018-04-24 02:52:05 Coconut oil is your best friend. 
9366 2018-04-24 02:52:02 Because they spend all day either looking up or looking down at a celebrity and a handful of old stale oil?

9368 2018-04-24 02:51:33 America has more than enough oil. We export it now we have so much

9370 2018-04-24 02:51:01 Tonight I diffused my meditation oil in my diffuser while I did my nightly yoga practice & it helped relax me feeling into each pose 
9371 2018-04-24 02:50:53 Just an interesting conclusion to draw about the “liberal media”.  You must realize they are too busy pushing endless war to ensure corporate control of more of the Middle East. Selling out to human rights violators for cheap oil is more important than a feel good story like this
9372 2018-04-24 02:50:45 Who has tried CBD Oil and what are your thoughts?
9373 2018-04-24 02:50:41 What is the alternative for plastic? Will it drive our costs up? What about food safety? I ask because May wants to ban oil without offering any practical or cost effective alternatives.
9374 2018-04-24 02:50:37 Not as much farming goes on in west texas anymore mainly oil field's now days more profitable to lease out to Big Oil .  There is plenty of sun wind and open land though.

9379 2018-04-24 02:49:54 Not surprised as he wasn’t a fan favourite of the Alberta oil sands proclaiming it should be shut completely down- unreasonable proposition needless to say. I tuned into The Nature of Things during his tenure as host, interesting science topics for educational purposes no doubt.
9380 2018-04-24 02:49:32 They are asking the same thing. If they did not have oil you would not care 1 Iota about them.
9381 2018-04-24 02:49:25 @sternshow @cwotd @salgovernale Hey guys when are you going to do that bit you mentioned a while back where you are both naked in a room covered in baby oil and @jonhein is also naked and tries to rape your rectums? I would be interested in watching this.

9385 2018-04-24 02:48:56 I see everything , but Embar ,you telling me out of everything , what shocked you was the oil part? Like the " a person was dead then alive all of a sudden" was  not that big but " by oil" is where you draw the line? 
9386 2018-04-24 02:48:55 Have you ever tried chili plasters? They smell a bit medicinal, of course, which they are, but you don't have to rub them in like oil, and they feel a bit like they're burning for about a minute, but, wow - the relief, and the feeling of well-being after can't be beat!

9390 2018-04-24 02:48:36 You still believe that propaganda... So sad. However, Canada has a blend of capitalism and socialism, just like Northern Europe (where you'll find the real greatest democracies in the world), and is, on the whole, doing fine. Just have to keep Justin from selling out to Big Oil.
9391 2018-04-24 02:48:32 Ethonal is the devil. This country needs to use the natural gas we have here and quit importing crude oil!!!!!

9407 2018-04-24 02:46:24 Neosporin, with the added pain killer, helped me when I had my staples removed. And someone recommended coconut oil to help with the scar. I was too lazy to do that though.

9415 2018-04-24 02:44:58 Really ? This has nothing to do with climate change ? Where is the evidence ? This ruling is based on opinion with out substantiated facts. This is not about oil or the pipeline. It’s about the constitution being chipped away by the liberals fantasies !
9416 2018-04-24 02:44:51 Transitioning from coconut oil to almond oil. Heard almond oil is better for sensitive skin. We shall see ...
9417 2018-04-24 02:44:46 Yes, Bush was an oil man. I totally agree with that. Over time 9/11 and all the complex issues have  become very murky, to say the least. People think govt knew about it beforehand. I get that.
9418 2018-04-24 02:44:39 All I wanna do is get my oil and lay in the sun.
9419 2018-04-24 02:44:36 There’ll be very little margin expansion for Canadian pumpers this year. No market scarcity thanks to Natty tanking. Thank the oil gods for the Duvernay which fills part of that gap. They hate taking on high rate, high pressure work. Chews through pumps.
9420 2018-04-24 02:44:28 No, I remember and it was not cool but I know the party that was complicit in and endless war. Not to mention the lie that was told about wmd’s that weren’t there. It’s all about the oil and money. And who had the interest in that? Halliburton/Cheney
9421 2018-04-24 02:43:55 Their squalene oil gave me these weird tiny bumps all over my face after a few days of use, was super disappointing cuz i wanted to incorporate a lightweight hydrating oil into my routine
9422 2018-04-24 02:43:50 But American and English corporations have exclusive "rights" to Iraqi oil now... isn't that why the USA and the "coalition of the willing" forced a war on a weaker nation?

9474 2018-04-24 02:35:16 You see how racist you are. Don’t you, right? They lived, hunted, gathered, played games, sang and danced. They produced happiness. Just because they don’t destroy it with oil fields, doesn’t mean you get a safe space.
9475 2018-04-24 02:35:03 BS. It succeeds on all counts. Your O&G donors want it dead to get Iranian oil and gas off the market so prices will rise even higher. This is futile however as we would be the only ones to pull out of the agreement.

9491 2018-04-24 02:32:56 Yeah. The reason is the government isn't requiring it as a condition for export. They aren't going to do it out of the goodness of their hearts.
I can't even blame the oil co's, they're just doing what they're supposed to; taking everything they can get.

9500 2018-04-24 02:30:49 #dumptrump blames OPEC for inflated oil prices because they cut production by about 2M barrels per day (bpd) but we (USA) are pumping over 10M bpd. So much so we export over 1/2M bpd to Europe. The high prices are caused by his bosom buddies Big Oil raking in profits & tax cuts!

9502 2018-04-24 02:30:42 Thoughts on the $9.7B over budget and behind schedule refiner at Sturgeon? Supported by the Alberta government through loan guarantees and a royalty-in-kind program? I’m personally not a fan of subsidies like this for oil. I also have no clue if this pays out, unsubsidized

9506 2018-04-24 02:30:06 In my experience, absolutely. These wings were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside... without breading. Which was pretty remarkable to me. It's not 100% perfect, but it is damned close to deep frying texture without the fatty oil.
9507 2018-04-24 02:30:03 The liberals have brainwashed the children to believe that shiping oil across the oceans is safer than a very well controlled pipeline with smart technology that monitors these pipelines 24/7 for even eventual problems or sabotage. #NotTheBrightestBulbs

9519 2018-04-24 02:28:23 The herb catalog even had a variety that has the strongest oil that the bugs really don't like but they only had them in seeds, and it was kind of late in the spring to start from seeds, so I didn't get them. So I just have the hardware store kind.

9536 2018-04-24 02:26:30 The biggest resource is ‘quality’ human capital, and it is what modernizes a society not gold or oil. So in this sense Africa is resource poor and has a shortage of resources to efficiently lead itself and run a bureaucratic system.
9537 2018-04-24 02:26:12 Ahhh I wanna try that cream so bad but always tell myself no. I got herbivore pink cloud and the lapis oil and the blue tansy mask. And that foundation is one of my all time faves!

9547 2018-04-24 02:24:32 Yep same with Beto. This no PAC money is bullshit. Go to open secrets and you can see all the corporate money flowing in from banks, for profit medicine, and oil and gas
9548 2018-04-24 02:24:21 Now I totally agree with you on George Jr., his lies have pretty much destroyed this country & for nothing except that war contractors made a fortune & the oil companies made a fortune by raising gas prices using the war as an excuse. I think he  & Chaney are war criminals.

9558 2018-04-24 02:23:05 Ran out of cooking oil so I used butter as an agent to cooking meatloaf. Drizzled maple syrup (because... me) and voila— Kettle Corn flavored meatloaf for breakfast.

9563 2018-04-24 02:22:06 For anyone. If there was ROI, wether for the oil corps, government or you and I we’d build one. Because we’d be chasing that ROI. Believe me, there’s capital out there ready to deploy, there’s a reason why it’s not getting deployed into a Refiner. But of course, u know that
9564 2018-04-24 02:22:03 Religion might be partly to blame...political correctness and the major countries thirst for war cetainly plays a big part in this puzzle...if people didn't profit from war and oil don't think we would have these issues...

9572 2018-04-24 02:21:17 Yep. Overall there's more interest in hot oil wrestling and lumberjack sports in the USA than for hockey. Yank media barely even acknowledges it's existence. The fans you see attending yank games represent basically the whole city.
9573 2018-04-24 02:21:07 Why is oil being exported from the US while we are importing oil from the Middle East???
9574 2018-04-24 02:21:05 told my dad I'm suicidal and his response was to talk about there being no bingo so he can change his tires and oil.
9575 2018-04-24 02:21:04 You forgot fuel oil powered 200'+ yachts, lavish second vacation homes, producing copious amounts of electronic trash, and the amount of energy required for them to go on the talk circuit to power the lights, camera, INACTION.
9576 2018-04-24 02:21:01 True, although beer and liquor prices increase gradually over periods of time, and we pay very high taxes on our beer here in NL. However oil prices can shoot up at any time for various reasons, real or imagined, lol.
9577 2018-04-24 02:20:58 Tom Steyer is affiliated with #FusionGPS. Go figure that fact. He was also a big oil man until he went green. Probably why he’s after Trump. His charity per say is green all the way and I suspect he has large investments in it.
9578 2018-04-24 02:20:54 Tip pan every minute or so to scoop oil in a spoon and pour over meat. This really helps keep meat moist and tender.

Push your thumb into the top of the meat every couple minutes to get used to how it feels. You'll learn when the meat is done by touch, after a couple tries.

Turn after 2-3 minutes to sear each side. Then 7 or 8 minutes per side.

9610 2018-04-24 02:16:44 You're absolutely right. It does make more sense... for the oil companies.

Took one of the last ever photos with Babe Ruth. Truly a remarkable, incredible life.

9680 2018-04-24 02:07:07 replacing coal or oil with biomass requires more biomass in weight to produce the same amount of energy.  This is a prescription for more clear cutting and an overall reduced carbon sink.  Less o2 too.  There is no concrete evidence of carbon neutrality

9700 2018-04-24 02:04:24 Hi, I think there are few factors at play here. Uncertain extent of April production rise, dependent on MPOA 1-20 Apr data. Looming general elections 9 May keeping the volume in cautious stage. Lack of fresh positive news. Drag in bean oil also been at play.

9838 2018-04-24 01:43:35 the only thing i *might* purchase again is rosehip oil
9839 2018-04-24 01:43:33 should be used as the limit of the rock approaches change in frequency coloration as the secant line derives the full debenture rates that Zapata Oil knew about and the executives hid this from mom and she is pissed.
9840 2018-04-24 01:43:33 Ever wonder why the West supports Saudi Arabia and helped fund Wahabbists? Because conservatives in the US and UK thought that right wing religious Muslims would be great tools to fight secular Socialist uprisings thst might nationalize oil.
9841 2018-04-24 01:43:20 The oil altered the inequality into an equation for Saudis since 1970s oil embargo.
9842 2018-04-24 01:42:55 You piss enough teachers off, along with enough Hispanic voters, and all incumbents in statewide offices should be scared. Throw in the business community, other than Big Oil, Big Insurance & Big Utilities, and this state cud b back to moderate or blue in a heartbeat.

9846 2018-04-24 01:41:57 Canada to oppose U.S. oil exploration on their own land. That should go over well but then again The liberals here oppose our own Countries oil.
9847 2018-04-24 01:41:31 Hey koi I ordered cbd oil after watching your video. Thanks you for spreading your knowledge and experience with it my way! 
9848 2018-04-24 01:41:23 Yeah there is, but you can’t get by without it. Does the oil coming from Saudi Arabia make it less impactful on the environment? I suppose shipping it here has way less of a carbon foot print then taking the resources we have already here.
9849 2018-04-24 01:41:17 Iran accounted for around 75% of the European oil production at that time, AIOC only gave a small percentage of the profits to the shah. Mossadegh wanted to split the profits 50-50, they refused, which led to the nationalisation of the oil production. Assholes then overthrew him

9919 2018-04-24 01:29:01 You’re right, capitalism works for a time but is collapsing around us.  Not sure what that has to do with anything.

My point is it’s great seeing someone finally go after oil companies, even if it is a petrostate.
9920 2018-04-24 01:28:55 i must be striking nerves lately

9932 2018-04-24 01:27:15 For every $1 of oil we export it basically counts as $2 to our GDP now that we are exporting an item we used to import.

Love it!
9933 2018-04-24 01:27:14 Chicken with garlic and olive oil.  And sautéed onions.  And linguine.  And some shredded mozzarella on top.

9935 2018-04-24 01:27:04 Free & simple PR tip for oil/gas co's in tri-state (OH/WV/PA)...I was behind slew of trucks going to fracking site today. PUT PA PLATES ON YOUR TRUCKS. Then grandma & neighbors can't whine about all the out-of-staters taking jobs, etc.  Put local state plates on, easy and simple!
9936 2018-04-24 01:26:58 That’s what I usually use and they still turn out bland!!!  BUT haven’t tried with the canola oil......
9937 2018-04-24 01:26:57 .@BloombergTV  discuss why $USDCAD is up and #Oil is up also. Something's gotta give

9944 2018-04-24 01:26:07 Haha twice  shit battery and a minor repair, this was all fucking now, I left the oil lid off and drove for 50 miles until the car broke down without realising
9945 2018-04-24 01:26:05 If Diezani bought a $1M oil tanker for NNPC without NASS approval, 80% of #TeamHypocrite would have lost their voices from screaming blue murder now. Buhari has spent $462M without approval.

9950 2018-04-24 01:24:58 OIL BRENT US$74.70/bbl +1.12%. Libya's Waha oil pipeline still under repair after last week's attack. Around 80kbpd of production impacted.

9953 2018-04-24 01:23:54 They are expensively being met. We could all have cheaper fuel and start putting those profits into our pockets instead of paying someone else. The oil sands isn’t as dirty as those “environmental” claim.
9954 2018-04-24 01:23:46 VHP member should stop travelling by any means of transport which runs on oil, we all know from where most of the oil is coming or ask someone who can relate oil with ancient science myths
9955 2018-04-24 01:23:46 Today was real unexpected. I went to get a oil change and left without my car.

9959 2018-04-24 01:23:21 Inter generational inequity on a biblical scale. No brainer, just put all the oil money in to pay for it.
9960 2018-04-24 01:23:13 You can boil them until tender and drain the water and heat it up with some scrapped coconut and a pinch of salt. Remember to use only the yellow bits the white part is not supposed to be eaten! Also use oil to remove the stickiness and be careful about getting that on clothes!
9961 2018-04-24 01:23:13 Oil gets there no matter what. Just by train burning Diesel. Not building  the pipeline is a mistake.
9962 2018-04-24 01:23:12 My dandruff and hair foofiness is far too much. Pls point me in the direction of the nearest lush or coconut oil.

10003 2018-04-24 01:17:16 What's driving the price up? I heard on the news the other night that the market is glutted with oil. They said the price hike is artificial and there are tankers loaded with oil just sitting and waiting in various oil producing countries. Strange thing.
