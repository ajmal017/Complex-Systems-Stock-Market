43 2018-12-25 19:32:32 Will do. It is brilliant, an absorbing mix of economics, philosophy, and politics. Not to be read in one go. Parts should be reread. Took me days and some tries at diagrams to get how commodities + money works in exchanges. I'll read that again.
44 2018-12-25 19:31:57 Agree it was a fatal mistake to close  BCL. Copper is now bullish in commodities. Reviving the mine is mid/long term project. So called investors are just fraudsters.For now lets relocate ministries and get region buzzing.
45 2018-12-25 19:21:17 So celebrating independence day @ Eagle Square equals good standard of living, low prices of essential commodities, security of lives and properties, poverty alleviation, low inflation rates, low unemployment rate, freedom of speech, human rights protection.

48 2018-12-25 18:35:17 Louder!!!!! Women are commodities nje
49 2018-12-25 18:27:38 The reason our food is so high is because of banks misusing the bailout money.  Instead of loaning out the money, as they were suppose to do, they invested in commodities & our food has since tripled.
50 2018-12-25 18:27:07 And, even when more than a few commodities that are utterly real are so highly valued, there's an element of fakery. A diamond is, after all, a shiny rock. Why do people toil in mines for gold? Because we've been convinced to see it as valuable far beyond any practical uses.
51 2018-12-25 18:16:04 Today the Capitalists added misery on the poor Zimbabweans by further increasing the prices of basic commodities. A loaf of bread was going for $2. Maybe this explains the Zimbabwe is open for business mantra and that's ripping off the poor, high taxes, exorbitant prices.

62 2018-12-25 16:28:11 Yes that is right.  And so when central banks around the world take away the free money. That was being used to pump up all asset classes. Including commodities like oil.  It causes the price to drop because investment money dried up

69 2018-12-25 15:42:45 there were international agreements over a number of commodities primarily produced in developing countries for precisely this reason. UNCTAD made a renewed effort and tried to expand the list in the 1970s. It is a mixed history.

78 2018-12-25 14:50:31 Naw. Men definitely talk about women as commodities, just things to conquer through sex. This dehumanization is what leads to assault especially when the guy "thought they were into it."  And rape culture encourages us to believe serial abusers over women. It's an institution.

I always wondered - 
How do you go long and short in commodities for long period of time? You were short oil and now short NG and long gold/silver (I believe)?
81 2018-12-25 14:34:31 Exactly Markus. Is it because of high prices of commodities so budget is limited to basic needs? Or were people afraid of stray bullets? 
82 2018-12-25 14:27:32 Isso é muita falta de noção sobre o nosso próprio comércio.

102 2018-12-25 10:47:22 Of course your choices are yours. But it’s state’s choice on which commodities or products to be taxed lower. 

And by the way your choices affect others too. So think before you tweet such idiotic messages.
103 2018-12-25 10:43:20 The thing is labor is not a commodity. Commodities are materials needed for manufacturing. Labor is the engine that makes the profit happen. Widgets don’t get made or sold without labor ever. If you use less labor, then unless you change your methods you make/sell fewer widgets.
104 2018-12-25 10:18:43 It is the high time to take steps against registered organisation of our country.price hiking of essential commodities,increasing price of LPG, petrol & diesel,abuse of the tax (GST),value of indian currency totally lacked to the foreign currency and so on are to be shown..

Uncontrolled govt expenditure;

109 2018-12-25 09:36:17 He has even now said taxing luxury goods and commodities at the same rate is not something he thinks is right for India. Well, he has a better sense for the political fallout.  In a country where 'chor' and 'amir' are used synonymously many times ...he has a point !

117 2018-12-25 08:17:17 I'm not saying polygamy was bad or unneccessary, but it made women seem like commodities- merely a means to procreate and work on farms.
 It's difficult for women from such societies to then be seen as equal to the men who buy them- so the colonialists did not cause our mysogyny

120 2018-12-25 07:59:58 What's happening in our shops today...all basic commodities are fully stocked
121 2018-12-25 07:55:59 La mia prima operazione sui future commodities fu sul petrolio....mi scordai la scadenza e per lunghi attimi ebbi il terrore che mi consegnassero tot barili di crude oil...fortunatamente era un future che si risolveva a scadenza in cash sulla differenza acquisto/vendita.
122 2018-12-25 07:53:41 Middle class is opportunistic . Middle class is mostly benefitted from economic reforms . See inflation rate .  d prices of essential commodities . Bank loans, tax returns , increased road , rail n air connectivities. Lower prices of medicines , stents etc . Can't satisfy them .
123 2018-12-25 07:52:07 Maybe so, but completely decoupled from commodities, & hard core myopic speculation.
124 2018-12-25 07:51:46 Is this the kind of answer you would give to your child for asking for a mere bottle of coca cola from you. For your comfort, coca cola is just but one of the many commodities that have gone beyond the reach of the majority of Zimbabweans.
125 2018-12-25 07:44:10 Then you will have people whining that essential commodities are being taxed unjustly under draconian policies
126 2018-12-25 07:43:15 Jis for interest's sake, isit clear to you my good sir that zimbabwe economy is suffering?
I mean do yu also feel it that basic commodities only sell on the black market once the economy takes a nose dive?
Jus asking?
127 2018-12-25 07:38:15 Let’s keep the jewelry Meek.. they are commodities. And high vibe relics by the way.
128 2018-12-25 07:32:45 Bitcoin is indeed an innovative commodity... that started an asset class of similar commodities.

So what is 'not so stable' about DAI? It has been rock stable during its entire existence, even during periods of extreme volatility of its collateral asset (ETH). Back your claims.
129 2018-12-25 07:32:06 Relievers have become disposable commodities in MLB. Seldom do they have longevity when they lose their stuff it happens very fast unexpectantly. No more Marianos. New world.
130 2018-12-25 07:26:50 Better drop everything & do something now against this Wall Street sell off NOW. Getting perilously close to another 2008 financial crisis. And fire the bastards Fed. They are the cause. They bloated commodities, refuse to release cash and now another 25 bases pts to rates.
131 2018-12-25 07:18:44 These jackasses with Trump better get on top of market sell off NOW. Dangerous territory, something never seen before. And reign in the goddam feds. Those bastards are the principal cause. Their move to bloat commodities, not releasing more cash and increase rates are the cause
132 2018-12-25 07:08:33 @PMOIndia Forward Trading on Exchanges of All Commodities through Commodity Exchanges should be stopped to curb speculative tendencies
133 2018-12-25 07:04:04 You seem to b enjoyng our struggle. Mny people are dying as we speak n Zimbabwe bcs of  the ZIDERA sunctions you imposed. You shld knw that those in power don't even feel the effects but we the ordinary citizens a suffering. We cn't afford basic commodities & drugs 4 our parents.
134 2018-12-25 06:40:09 As of the 21st, almost everything except for India, Healthcare, Utilities, some short and government bonds and some shorted commodities DOWN. So, Almost anybody fully invested or even half invested has taken a turn downward in the past 3.5 wks! Merry Xmas!

137 2018-12-25 06:31:14 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
138 2018-12-25 06:20:22 Do you in your honest right mind believe "just our precious commodities (minerals) " have been correctly accounted? Let's be frank or we'll remain carcass... I hope you're not just doing the defend defend while knowing the truth 
139 2018-12-25 06:16:14 So it's not rude to replace girl with her best friend? ai they're cheap commodities ko?
140 2018-12-25 06:10:17 Stick to commodities
141 2018-12-25 06:05:57 5. Under his government in 1984, inflation was all time high. Nigerians cried queueing for their portions of scarce commodities like rice, sugar, salt, milk and toiletries.
Life was hard as f*ck.
142 2018-12-25 05:51:27 Another massive blow to the nation due to the LNP being held to ransom by its multinational donors & mates largely farming cotton of all commodities. Imagine the disaster to the artesian basin when Adani gets underway
143 2018-12-25 05:49:45 40% off highs and into support zone. World's not that bad imo, especially commodities which is a big chunk of XEC
144 2018-12-25 05:31:39 Still no clue how commodities markets operate? And the law of supply & demand? Ignorance is par for the course, looks like. Btw, note that commodities "cartels" don't work where there are supply gluts. But u know all that, don't u?.. @tunfaisal @teresakok
145 2018-12-25 05:27:29 Dude, it is just a minor correction and reaction to the Fed raising the Prime, yet again, for the 7th time since Trump took office. People can now invest in CDs, Bonds, Notes and Bills instead of just Stocks and Commodities. Geez.
146 2018-12-25 05:18:16 Very, very few consumer products that aren’t absolute commodities sell for less than 2 to 4 times manufacturing cost, which is what Bloomberg is estimating here. But 1kwh batteries selling for more than $1k is absurd (Stromer).
147 2018-12-25 05:13:01 Take a position against agricultural commodities using Gaussian noise to offset low volume pullback.
148 2018-12-25 05:09:14 Well, my gasoline is much cheaper, no inflation there. Commodities, not much inflation there. Groceries, maybe a little more inflation there with some products. The highest increase overall are wages, healthcare, education and prescription drugs.
149 2018-12-25 05:08:14 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
150 2018-12-25 05:00:01 Commodities: Rubber -1.56%
151 2018-12-25 04:36:44 Developers will be the mechanics of the future; everyone will need one, many will be commodities in big shops, the good ones get paid well, and the best ones have a lifetime of guaranteed stable income from trusted friends, family, and colleagues and never need to advertise.
152 2018-12-25 04:35:38 Yaa I understand that .dai ma basic commodities acho aikwira ma price kunge ma combi  mmm aitengeka here? At times tirikuzvikuvadza tega .
153 2018-12-25 04:23:15 Hopefully they have a decent broker - I had to re-align almost I’ll of my investments today - heavy in retail and precious metals. Waiting to get back into commodities early 2q19
154 2018-12-25 04:15:37 So my bullish thought process goes: Fed and govt trying to "fix" things with QE driving the dollar down and commodities way up. Equities slide downward indefinitely.
155 2018-12-25 04:13:06 Fair.  Not this low on DSI.  Like all commodities the cure for low prices is low prices.
156 2018-12-25 04:10:59 Stocks, and bonds, and commodities asshole.  Where else to put it?  Gotta be in an IRA. Do you understand that every single stock even the blue chips are in freefall?
157 2018-12-25 04:05:35 Yes ofcourse Jaitley ji you & your govt have to show little work by bringing down the taxes of the commodities etc etc...simply because Election is knocking the door right..??bohot ullu banaya public ko..achhe din ayenge kabhi nahi ayenge jab tak corrupted Neta hein.
158 2018-12-25 03:59:15 There are advantages to @dollarstore's supply chain. Others who open up shops in the neighborhoods discussed in that /. article may want to look at practicality and focus more on tangible, affordable commodities and less on plastic stuff made in China.
159 2018-12-25 03:58:36 Taxing fuel equates to raising the cost of basic commodities in Kenya.

160 2018-12-25 03:53:56 I mean the welfare state is just the socialization of certain services. The point of communism is to treat all commodities like the welfare state, basically. How can you be against the welfare state and call yourself a communist?
161 2018-12-25 03:41:48 Tangible assets: Real estate , food commodities,  guns , fuels , medicine.
162 2018-12-25 03:38:57 Many people say crypto is or isn't a hedge to the stock market. It is. It's also a hedge against precious metals, bonds, etc. 

You should have a balanced portfolio consisting of many things including commodities, crypto, and stock... maybe not stock right now though.
163 2018-12-25 03:30:24 Equities are fwd looking as are commodities, so I'm thinking we are pricing in a global slowdown.
164 2018-12-25 03:16:35 With two jobs and no rent or utilities to pay, I can afford to purchase commodities, move somewhere with fresh water, and learn the skills that will contribute to my survival. The shit is going down - I don't know what else to say. May God be with us all!
165 2018-12-25 03:14:01 Watching this movie about late stage capitalism that mentions about how people become commodities and meanwhile sends idol pics to my friends online
166 2018-12-25 02:57:43 De politiek moet de mens zelf weer centraal stellen. Wij zijn geen commodities, dat zijn we gemaakt, juist door de staat!
167 2018-12-25 02:56:22 In his own words, Trump was never a "market" guy.
He liked to buy and sell land, buildings make 'deals" on branding & products.
He has little to no experience or knowledge about the stick market, bond market, commodities, etc...

168 2018-12-25 02:53:34 Herbert Hoover was President when the Great Depression began. On Oct. 25, 1929, Herbert Hoover declared, "The fundamental business of the country, that is the production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous basis."
That came to be known as Black Thursday.
169 2018-12-25 02:48:43 People's miseries are media's commodities. They play by that rule, sadly 
170 2018-12-25 02:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

Oil Commodities Traders Sext to Refiners

@propapergirl
173 2018-12-25 02:24:48 @Abhishekkar_ @Mitesh_Engr Since last 3 months I've been only trading commodities and actually making it work (esp.Crudeoil). But, Almost afraid of equities, because of the previous bad experiences. So, Should I keep my focus on commodities and avoid the regular markets for now.?
174 2018-12-25 02:15:43 OPEC transferred lots of money to broke countries. Could other commodities b cartelized by poor states like that? Which ones?
175 2018-12-25 02:14:34 If you want to have a civil convo I’m totally in, but let’s narrow the topic to one thing at a time.  Commodities generally refers to raw products, oil, wood, steel.  That’s what I was referring too.  Those prices are lower generally esp oil.  Groceries, I’ve found are up,
176 2018-12-25 02:10:46 You suggested groceries are not commodities by stating one is going up in prices and the other isn’t.
177 2018-12-25 02:05:03 3262: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
178 2018-12-25 02:04:23 You guys are buzz killers. Today, you will accept superheroes doing impossible "superheroey" things, yet crush a hard working Chicago Board of Trade commodities guy working the system when controls were a little lax, lol
179 2018-12-25 01:55:55 War is the systematic murder of the poor who are treated like disposable commodities by the ruling elites.
180 2018-12-25 01:46:03 LOL. The Duke buy & sell commodities (pork bellies, soybeans, OJ, etc.). Lewis & Billy Ray (now illegally) drove up the price of OJ to then sell their shares at a higher price
181 2018-12-25 01:38:33 You're a kook! Billions of dollars have left Canada, oil and pot are two commodities that he has bungled. 100,000 Albertans out of work, and you elitists living in a bubble down East have no clue, your opinion is in the minority. You probably believe in the UN compact as well.
182 2018-12-25 01:29:42 okay comrades, before we keep celebrating the #ChristmasDip, i have more news.
i remebered my econ course and the relationship between stocks and commodities, and after a search, i just found out that economists are expecting prices for gas and energy to rise.
expect inflation
183 2018-12-25 01:23:09 Thank god I was LONG Red Dye #2 on the commodities market.

The gains in that position just offset all of my December losses in the stock market.
184 2018-12-25 01:22:11 I have followed him on this matter. Even today he is a proponent of taxing luxury goods at a higher rate compared to commodities ( you may diagree but  he seems consistent ) and he has to take along all states which get affected by lower tax rates.
185 2018-12-25 01:20:16 Commodities = groceries. First you’re complaining about high prices of groceries and next you’re saying commodities haven’t increased. FYI, idiot stick in the US slapped us with tariffs, that increases our costs of those commodities too.
186 2018-12-25 01:13:57 Government taxes us to provide services, some necessary, Some spending increases gov jobs and inefficiencies.  Unfortunately Gov spending also increases prices as in the case of subsidized industries.  Commodities are not the reason for higher prices as these have fallen.
187 2018-12-25 01:10:47 Money is socially agreed upon exchange commodity that gives all other commodities direct reference for common trade within a market. You moron.
188 2018-12-25 01:06:42 Small business aren’t the ones increasing the prices of commodities.
189 2018-12-25 01:06:17 “Groceries”???? Which groceries? Some are, some aren’t. Again, don’t push the responsibility of lower prices onto Gov’t when it lies with big corporations. Gov’t taxes us to provide services, but the increase in commodities happens with or without taxes. That is corporate greed.
190 2018-12-25 01:05:18 Understanding practical ecology, horticulture and animal husbandry; business operations, managment,  and marketing; commodities timing and forcasting; as well as how to maintain, fix,  fabricate equipment, machinery, and structures will get you *started* to success as a farmer.
191 2018-12-25 01:04:58 clean energy, commodities, & crypto.
192 2018-12-25 00:58:32 #shutdownstories  Maybe Trump could have found his $5 billions by looking at the $867 farm bill. Unfortunately, he decided the money was needed because farmer and ranchers suffered steep declines in commodities prices amid Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Opps.
193 2018-12-25 00:56:12 Hah, maybe.  Were you not passionate about those commodities?  Did you not enjoy getting up in the morning to create something that wasn't there before.
194 2018-12-25 00:50:18 Claro, com o nosso rival exportador(EUA) em crise em 2002 pois estava em guerra, e com a China começando a aumentar sua influência no mercado mundial, vendemos nossas recem descobertas commodities para os Chineses, nosso PIB aumentou muito,nao foi por causa de um analfabeto nao
195 2018-12-25 00:45:21 1) Read 10 books on Investigation and financial decisions before the year out.
2) Forex and Commodities trading
3)PMP/Agile certification

5) working on my social anxiety/going out more
196 2018-12-25 00:45:11 Commodities price internationally. If you buy gas you will pay the commodity price. Either it comes from@Venezuela or Qatar. Cheaper Venezuela looses. More expensive U.K. looses. Aaron is as dumb as they come
197 2018-12-25 00:36:13 They did greater things for the ownership class, once they (+gov +industrialists) killed off the IWW industrial unions. Stopped destructive strikes, people got used to being paid and treated like commodities, most of the workers paid for our dismantling while owners kept profits.
198 2018-12-25 00:33:33 I just have to ask why computers are seen as leisure items... maybe because they didn’t used to be as prolific - I remember my first being a 50 pound Tandy with a whopping 250 MB hard drive costing 4K. Even though a lot have them, a lot still don’t. They’re still commodities.
199 2018-12-25 00:14:27 I already told I don’t care who is ruling be it congress or BJP my voice will be against the fuel price hike. Instead of childish blaming tell me is it right to put the burden of fuel price which directly affects other commodities prices on common people.
200 2018-12-25 00:11:22 So fix it. Stop tolerating an ineffecient, technologically broken government and a profit driven market place for commodities people need to survive.
201 2018-12-25 00:08:36 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
202 2018-12-25 00:01:07 we must protect these precious non-smash community commodities at all costs
