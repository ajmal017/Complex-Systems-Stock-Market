6 2018-11-24 23:48:00 Bitcoin's weekend bloodbath is not a good sign for U.S. stocks on Monday.  It's not just the crypto bubble that is popping.  #Bitcoin is just leading the way down for speculative assets, as it's the most speculative asset of them all!

36 2018-11-24 23:33:13 It's very easy to understand @Femi_Sorry - we will regain the rights to once again overcatch in UK waters depleting the fish stocks towards extinction, while being unable to sell any fish outside of the UK (and probably not in Northern Ireland or Gibraltar either).
37 2018-11-24 23:31:25 People of color...they may have more employment but not as much growth as white people.That was very deceiving. Wages have not gone up bc the big tax cut receivers are buying back stocks, and more vacas.

41 2018-11-24 23:27:54 Reading medical tweets in theatre is probably a better use of hospital internet bandwidth than reviewing one's stocks / ForEx trading situation.

(May be unfair generalisation from anaesthetists to GP anaesthetists). ;-)
42 2018-11-24 23:27:50 Well it is because of the yearly reporting for profits/ stocks etc. Black Friday is the last kick at the can for reporting a company is ‘in the black’ for the end of the year. (at least in the non-instant computer age of reporting losses and gains) so sell off what you can.

47 2018-11-24 23:25:32 I've already tweeted this question many times, just ask @rhapsaadic ; Why trade bitcoin when you have stocks like $GOOGL $NFLX $BA $CMG  moving a ton everyday?  They have very long histories of trading and are MUCH more liquid, allowing you to cash out to your bank in no time. 
48 2018-11-24 23:25:15 Of course they are out there, Its's called #Bitcoin it will be between $200-$400 Trillion in 15-30 years, wiping out all other monies and the debt markets, all debt and even taking some value from real estate and stocks. Stop looking so hard. Its in front of your face.
49 2018-11-24 23:24:48 LOL you're just not going to give up okay yes I've seen the stock market it says tech stocks are selling off because of problems Facebook and Google are having. I'm sure shortly it will straighten itself back out again and it really has nothing to do with our economy it has to do

61 2018-11-24 23:12:41 1. Owning more than one house in a place subject to earthquakes, unless you have massive diversified financial wealth already, seems absolutely absurd. I feel incredibly exposed owning only the one.

2. Stocks in the Kiwisaver portfolio may drop in value but are not a hassle.

63 2018-11-24 23:11:48 Go ahead and enjoy your pop corn while fresh. I have a tee shirt that says We survived OBama. So you will survive Trump. By the way one of my stocks went up $20.00 a share in one quarter. That didn’t occur under OBama’s leadership or lack of.
64 2018-11-24 23:09:53 Rothschild owns most of the stocks & has more power than other stockholders.
65 2018-11-24 23:09:51 So far, the BTC rout is an orderly bear market. The blood isn't in the street until exchanges are halting and transactions can't be completed, etc. The stock market does this regularly and I think we will eventually see this in crypto. Stocks dropped 25% single day Oct 1987.
66 2018-11-24 23:09:33 Stocks are falling because interest rates are slowly creeping up. He can’t control the treasury secretary and how that gets done. Interest rates went from 1.5% to 2.75% in less than a year. This has a tendency to stunt economic growth. There is a crisis at the border. That’s fact
67 2018-11-24 23:09:21 The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the person of inferior emotional balance, or the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die poor.

70 2018-11-24 23:05:04 YTD 36% of stocks higher out of 4594 stock universe with 63% lower. Hmm... we have not sold off enough???
71 2018-11-24 23:02:09 I also draw the same line there. If we are heading towards a financial recession, why would these big players be in crypto when they can sell Bitcoin to raise money and better position themselves in stocks.
72 2018-11-24 23:02:08 .. the artist's image and also to agency, in some cases it affects their stocks. Also, once they date, public will always relate the idols who dated even when the relationship's over. Presumably this why many idols dont want to date publicly.
73 2018-11-24 23:01:27 I would think twice about buying any stocks with Cheetos as prez
74 2018-11-24 23:01:13 I will say that just like #stocks , now is the time to take #taxloss on #bitcoin - that is probably factoring in to the continued drop. I also think the hard fork from #bitcoincash didn't help the market.

77 2018-11-24 22:57:29 REAL Fake News: 
Bus stocks have hit an all time high just within this last year. It appears that with so many of Trump's cronies throwing other people "under the bus", we were in danger of running out of buses, causing a serious uptick in bus production.
78 2018-11-24 22:55:59 I think they're upset that he pulled out all his stocks.  But we all know what they'll find.  Zip!
79 2018-11-24 22:52:45 #bitcoin tanking & down to $3,750. Last year folks that sold bitcoin probably paid big taxes. However cause our #taxcode is antiquated & old, u can only take 3k in tax writeoff even though ur losses this year can b substantial (same applies to stocks. Allowed losses shud b raised
80 2018-11-24 22:50:00 People who bought BTC at $20k on credit cards or got burned in crashing mining stocks might though.
81 2018-11-24 22:49:53 Tactique pour faire croire que les stocks sont faibles..les prix augmentent puis on vend a prix exorbitant..cela vous paraissait aussi drôle quand on ne trouvait plus de beurre en rayon en France en début d' année ??
82 2018-11-24 22:47:33 i wanted a couple play-it-safe stocks  and they’ll probably be fine in a year but the entire stock market has just been terrible lately
83 2018-11-24 22:45:57 I use acorns just to store money and invest in stocks. It doesn’t have the best ROI but it’s nice to just accumulate. Also working on getting into REIT style investments.

86 2018-11-24 22:43:31 Haha now we know why people lose money on stocks
87 2018-11-24 22:42:38 You know most small businesses dont have stocks?

89 2018-11-24 22:41:25 The state where I live has the highest rising homeless problem so they dont get Unemplyment benifits and dont get counted. Also wheres the survey for people who have no stocks or savings and living pay day to pay day?
90 2018-11-24 22:41:15 @profgalloway is missing the point again. Zuck is unfireable because of the shares of stocks is structured.
91 2018-11-24 22:40:41 Well... yes.

But we're still in early deterioration mode in the stock market. I'll do my victory laps at -50% (or worse)

Bitcoin's at -80% on its way to -99%+

At least with stocks there is still a measure of value beneath the years of hype.

98 2018-11-24 22:30:04 There is no example of a mature market where the tail (derivatives) did not wag the dog (the underlying).

101 2018-11-24 22:29:14 Making homemade stocks on my reading days is so damn cozy. I read for hours while the stock simmers for hours. House smells good. Reading and cooking gets done. Does anyone else do this? If not TRY IT.
102 2018-11-24 22:28:47 6 figures in 6 years. Salary or stocks, doesn’t matter. I need it.

105 2018-11-24 22:26:24 I been investing in stocks for a while now but I just barely started taking it serious and that shit is so risky but fun as hell 
106 2018-11-24 22:25:52 Something tells me #faang stocks will rally hard next week and so will #Bitcoin. Everything's just way too oversold in such a short period of time.
107 2018-11-24 22:24:23 However, I dont think it's a bad idea to invest into crypto in the near future like within a few days, they are definitely going to bounce back. I'm going to buy a few penny stocks when the times right. Day traders should swing trade CRYP, at least I think so #stockmarket #stocks
108 2018-11-24 22:23:45 FAANG stocks:- #FAANG..  They are at their short term inflection point now at the week ending 11/23. If you want then you can fish around for short-term call options. If it has to work then it should find low here to - 2  to 3% from current price. (APPL, NFLX, GOOG, MSFT, FB)
109 2018-11-24 22:23:33 Is there a reason why you would more  ETFs as trading vehicle than individuals stocks in a bear market?
110 2018-11-24 22:19:58 Stocks are all down. I doubt it very seriously 
111 2018-11-24 22:16:28 Gonna go against the grain and say counterpick. I don't dislike the stage, but in S4 the platform was useful for strats that avoided engaging with the opponent & early stocks. Idk what it'll do in Ultimate, but may be worth making it a counterpick.
112 2018-11-24 22:16:06 Stocks go up and down...

118 2018-11-24 22:09:24 No more difficult than any other traditional exchange.  People have been trading stocks, bonds, funds, and all kinds of contracts for 2 decades on line.  Pretty much the same experience trading crypto, with the added benefit of 24x7 markets that are open holidays around the world
119 2018-11-24 22:07:39 My Tesco stocks Belvoir cordials. 

Try Asda, if you have one nearby - they also sell them.
120 2018-11-24 22:07:34 Sometimes you gotta know when to give up. 

You have to sell and save whatever is left.

126 2018-11-24 22:01:37 The people who make money in the stock market are the players. Buy low, sell high. You lost money because the players sold their stock and made fortunes. They will be back in when the stocks go real low.

130 2018-11-24 21:57:28 im not gonna argue with you but penny stocks can be extremely profitable you are right but it isnt a way a teenager should be getting an income penny stock companies are over-leveraged which means they are in a lot of debt and tend towards bankruptcy.
131 2018-11-24 21:51:29 Their director sold 3$ stocks per night after publicity found truth about #shotspotter. It's scam. $SSTI #fraud
132 2018-11-24 21:51:25 Penny stock companies are often headed for bankruptcy or are highly overleveraged just the fact that you suggest investing in penny stocks and gambling being a form of income shows you dont know a thing about investing
133 2018-11-24 21:50:24 Mandem should just be single, forever making thier girlfriends laughing stocks
134 2018-11-24 21:49:43 Penny stocks are pretty much gambling.
135 2018-11-24 21:49:18 There's times when assumptions are true, i'm studying for my A levels but make 7k per annum and i wouldnt put a penny in stocks and shares

137 2018-11-24 21:47:08 Being unwell has its perks..Not partying on the weekend and seeing tons of weekly charts..plenty of sectors look weak. Already shared Metals and IT. Can add cement to that space too. Actually 90% of the stocks i saw had bad weekly charts.
138 2018-11-24 21:47:08 Virtually everyone who has money in stocks and mutual funds has seen the value go way down in the last two months.   Trump was bragging constantly about how well it was going, now he's not.
139 2018-11-24 21:46:28 perfect weekend divested a bunch of crummy stocks and silver.  Drinking money and some.  Nope maybe I'll buy some greenbacks
140 2018-11-24 21:45:43 The New York Times is not a firearms expert nor a valid source for facts. You said you were quoting the Las Vegas crime report, please do so.

Again, Bump stocks do not increase the rate of fire of any weapon and saying it does shows total ignorance in how a weapon fires.
141 2018-11-24 21:45:30 My hair is a way darker green than I expected! I'm really happy about that because I actually originally did want a dark green colour (even darker than how my hair turned out with this dye). No place in my city stocks dark green Manic Panic or Arctic Fox.
142 2018-11-24 21:45:21 Nope. No they don't. It's ironic also NRA has supported the most tyrannical leaning Pres ever in US History. The founding fathers probably didn't envisage auto assault weapons, bump stocks and armour piercing bullets.
143 2018-11-24 21:44:56 Stocks will be on sale on Monday #blackfriday #investor
144 2018-11-24 21:44:52 Stocks don't go up everyday for infinity?  Look at the chart.  Was it not due for a rest?
145 2018-11-24 21:44:13 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
146 2018-11-24 21:43:56 I wouldn’t say it’s a non issue, it def is escalating.  But those same investors were buying stocks April-Oct, just saying.  

I mostly don’t agree with you minimizing the effects of rate hikes. The guys on my floor are very concerned about the Fed overhiking.
147 2018-11-24 21:42:46 When you get money you don't want to put it in stocks or betting.

151 2018-11-24 21:42:31 Researching renewable energies is exhausting because we consume so much more than we can produce... Our massive energy consumption depends on stocks of ancient photosynthesis from coal, oil, gas... its a fundamentally imbalanced equation
152 2018-11-24 21:42:25 "Overvalued shitcoins attract attacks". People have been making scam coins because they were so many gullible users to buy them, like penny stocks. There will be a great tide of cleaning up, whether SEC, attackers or so forth, to discourage the creation of these.

159 2018-11-24 21:35:44 Junk bonds are headed #bonds toward the rapids and, soon thereafter, over the waterfall.  #stocks The premium over safe Treasuries demanded by investors has shrunk to levels which have historically marked the inception of junk bond bear markets.  Huge distance...DOWN.
160 2018-11-24 21:34:34 might want to explain that to the worlds most sophisticated investors who have been unloading stocks because of trade war fears cant wait to hear what they say!
161 2018-11-24 21:34:21 For 2019, excluding energy, the quarter over quarter revenues are weakening on S&P 500 components, even though year over year revenues have grown in 2018. If stocks bounce here, Fed may not react in December until stocks sell off more in Q1’19. $SPX

164 2018-11-24 21:32:48 If Sony does this that'd be the final nail in their coffin no more GTA, COD, or battlefield! Their stocks would drop in price faster than a feminist can scream toxic masculinity, investors would pull their monetary backing, and devs would turn to other consoles

166 2018-11-24 21:30:47 About time. Once these thieving oiks are run off the road every town centre should have stocks I which these fools can placed. A good flogging might help.

Never mind.

170 2018-11-24 21:27:41 Economy was going up under 44,  we are seeing the beginning of the 45 effect stocks are crumbling,  trade is horrible,  bail outs to farmers,  steel compnaies closing and manufacting companies are running away! School suck now funding down,  roads suck now funding down.
171 2018-11-24 21:26:01 If rates keep rising, then it COULD be a problem for companies with higher debt levels like utilities & telecom stocks,   Also, companies with a lot of longer-term floating rate debt could be problematic.   Companies with quality investment grade ratings should be okay.

173 2018-11-24 21:25:04 That's where you're wrong. WWE don't want to lead with Becky. The fans are demanding it though. This was never the plan. Can only be good for the stocks.
174 2018-11-24 21:24:41 This should be the test that allows someone to visit a casino, buy stocks directly, or purchase a lottery ticket.
175 2018-11-24 21:23:02 Back when peak oil really meant 'peak'--stocks would start declining faster than wells could be drilled, etc., with the real possibility of oil shortages by 2050--that may have been catastrophic, but at least it'd have been survivable.
176 2018-11-24 21:22:09 We might be at 'peak' oil production in terms of the energy return on investment, but stocks of shale & non-conventional oil are sufficiently large that even at current growth rates, a warming earth would kill us long before we run out of oil.
177 2018-11-24 21:20:45 Damn my whole TL is “men this, men that, if he does this, if he looks at you like” jeeeeez.. invest that energy in some stocks or something.. and go gay while you’re at it

179 2018-11-24 21:15:53 My concerns are:
1. The necessity of continual upkeep
2. Irreversible effects
3. Non-linear effects
4. Distribution effects
5. Deterioration of fundamental stocks&sinks
6. Corporate/Military spillovers
7. Massive downstream weather fx
180 2018-11-24 21:15:20 Blackwells maybe, though they only really cover university towns.  I don't consider WH Smith a bookshop, more a stationery shop that stocks some books - children's graphic novels are a tiny part of the huge range of genres they don't stock!
181 2018-11-24 21:15:18 Too bad they don't look at his biggest investments now & tank those stocks  just kidding, George!
182 2018-11-24 21:14:31 Actually, the FED prints money which they lend to the rich at cheaper rates than anyone else can get it, they invest this in stocks bonds etc, eventually everything crashes and the poor and the rich have their money halved, but the rich are now several times richer than before.

You still own the same # of stocks and if you are still investing, you are now buying them cheaper and increasing your potential 4 higher gains when the market rebounds.

189 2018-11-24 21:09:08 If United want any hope of rebuilding they have to pull off the stocks for Poch. Helps in our favour that Real Madrid have tied down their manager as well. Question is... will we? Dont trust Ed Woodward at all.
190 2018-11-24 21:08:19 cant wait to isolate the snake player and take all of their stocks

192 2018-11-24 21:06:01 i need this shit to hit so i can get these stocks 
193 2018-11-24 21:03:19 Mine as well, it makes sense to hedge against the people that cause these market crashes

198 2018-11-24 21:00:20 Well as you said depends on the time frame, people escaped to commodities when stocks crashed. Before 2007 there was a food crisis in many countries, the blame it on weAther conditions and so on.. who really knows, all we know prices doubled or more.
Consider btc as a commodity
199 2018-11-24 20:59:58 Not sure I live where gas is cheap and stocks are soaring...must be some other USA...
200 2018-11-24 20:58:54 That’s very poor considering quinny can tell me who stocks them within mothercare. I will go to a retail to is more able to assist !!!

202 2018-11-24 20:52:59 So you invested in stocks?  It is going to be volatile.  If you don’t like that, invest in something safer.

205 2018-11-24 20:51:37 Even if that happens all stocks don’t move in unison.  Tesla right now has the best growth potential out of all the tech stocks and that can only be discounted for so long.  Also, I doubt we’ll see anything as severe as 08 and if that’s the case I expect some legacy OEMs to fail
206 2018-11-24 20:48:24 someone pretty much took the stocks right off his header and added the envy logo and stuff
207 2018-11-24 20:46:03 Take responsibility and don't play victim. Pick better stocks.
208 2018-11-24 20:45:45 Cómo para no. Desde entonces en Primark y similares no ganan para reponer stocks. Si ya lo dijo Anita la primera semana...
209 2018-11-24 20:45:05 Well that’s you choice to choose your stocks.
210 2018-11-24 20:44:28 If your 401K is tanking your the fool not Trump stocks have doubled since he has been in office if your 401k is doing poorly it’s because you don’t know how to invest. Not because of Trump!
211 2018-11-24 20:42:00 No sir, that’s for stocks right?
212 2018-11-24 20:41:06 Ex-US stocks have performed far worse over past year so is that Trump’s fault also?

214 2018-11-24 20:37:48 My thesis is bankers NEED a crypto bubble -b/c they can justify higher valuations
as there is no basis to value cryptos
real estate is limited by income/interest rates
stocks by valuations
bonds by rates
gold/silver by demand
Cryptos can be pumped quickly/easily 10-20X from here
215 2018-11-24 20:37:40 Perhaps you should read up on (And i don’t mean in the last 2 years) the history of the USA. Unemployment, stocks, borders, socialism. I know it’s a lot, but you really have no clue
216 2018-11-24 20:36:33 asset managers are leveraged to risk assets. their firm's AUM fees + personal investments + firm valuation all decline with stocks. hedging in some way necessary
217 2018-11-24 20:35:26 I'm 71 and my retirement account is down appx $38,000 since trump became president and no, I'm not heavily invested in risky stocks, but apparently too much in the S&P500. All the gains made in the stick market in 2018 are now gone thanks to him. 
218 2018-11-24 20:32:37 I think this strategy is more of a gamble than penny stocks, lol
219 2018-11-24 20:31:51 You gamble in the stock market you take the risk. Before your loss how much did you gain? You risk your 401k in stocks because there is potential for higher returns. It’s jot a guarantee. Your choice.
220 2018-11-24 20:31:21 @WildlifeMag looked in Asda and two spars so far with no luck finding this issue. Who defo stocks it?
221 2018-11-24 20:30:47 @Tesco My online shop replaced Beyond Meat Burgers with Quorn , what is the nearest store to Hammersmith that stocks the Beyond Burger? No luck at West Kensington or Brook Green
222 2018-11-24 20:29:58 Despite large percentage declines for technology stocks, the overall indexes are close to being unchanged so far in 2018:  DJIA  -1.8%,  S&P 500 -1.5%, and Nasdaq +0.5%.
223 2018-11-24 20:29:40 "Kaine on Banks."  I'm avoiding bank stocks.  Trend is negative.  Initially when trump took office banks rallied with promise of fewer regulations and tax cuts.  Then banks declined because of increased competition.  Also concern about slowing global growth.
224 2018-11-24 20:28:31 He's cut taxes that help the wealthy, stocks are down again, Nationwide Ins.  letting 1100 people go, ISIS is still around, home grown terrorism on the rise. Oh & let's see, how many indictments of people from his admin (all "the best people" he has hired). U R delusional.
225 2018-11-24 20:28:30 Yup...did. It’s a sh*t storm of communism out here.
226 2018-11-24 20:28:15 Well, in 2008 when the market was crashing, Apple was one of the only stocks to survive and thrive
227 2018-11-24 20:28:12 Rice is the backbone of working class black American meals. Every meat went with rice, and if you were too poor for certain meats, you had stocks, neck bones, hocks, rice held in all the flavors.
228 2018-11-24 20:28:10 WHAT THE FUCK APPLE STOCKS
229 2018-11-24 20:27:47 Bitcoin is not hairbrained.  The stocks may well be.
230 2018-11-24 20:24:38 And conservatives need to read the economic reports, there was and will be no trickle down anything!  Corporations used the extra money by buying back their stocks. The rich put in offshore banks. Trickle down didn't work for Reagan and it won't work now.
231 2018-11-24 20:22:43 He called @'ed me on twitter months ago calling me a "toxic top player" or smth like that for crouch spamming when I took stocks on him on exhib loool
232 2018-11-24 20:22:27 Stocks.

Those are still a thing right?
233 2018-11-24 20:21:55 With the latest tech wreck, over 40 percent of the S&P 500 stocks have fallen at least 20 percent from their recent peaks!
234 2018-11-24 20:21:19 Canadian stocks are always cheap because nobody wants them.
235 2018-11-24 20:20:26 Isn't that why stocks are sold as futures? What's happening now reflects on real later.
236 2018-11-24 20:19:25 Blame your investors.

Probably have a portfolio full of tech stocks.

Invest in America.
237 2018-11-24 20:19:18 oh yeah, i know that but i recall they couldn't give them away, my local stores all had stocks they couldn't shift so is it really that rare? kind of regret not forking out the extra couple of quid to get one with its manual now
238 2018-11-24 20:16:23 Certainly some will go to zero. Just like some stocks go to zero. But if BTC rallies the alt market will rally. Of course alts sucked recently... BTC went down.
239 2018-11-24 20:14:23 Constitutional right to bear arms,absolutely. How about bump stocks,is that needed too. How about those who are mentally challenged and still carry? The laws needs to be revised in order to protect innocent lives . Just  Incase you’re a little slow,the lettuce was a reference
240 2018-11-24 20:14:07 probably move completly to stocks? i dont want to give up that awesome realx "pure" lifestyle TBH :D
241 2018-11-24 20:14:04 The stocks on torches and pitch forks went way up.
242 2018-11-24 20:13:18 11/27 - "Kaine System" indicates  Reduce "Short" stock positions.  Negatives for stocks are moving averages, wealth, & investor confidence.  BUT stocks are near long-term support and very oversold.  Also Economy is strong.   Oil price decline - Fed may delay interest rates hikes.
243 2018-11-24 20:13:07 nice
244 2018-11-24 20:12:08 I am so sick of this! The tech giants manipulate stocks, too. And then the market tanks, our 401k diminishes and they laugh all the way to the bank.
245 2018-11-24 20:11:59 I wonder how many firms are all a "hold or sell" rating? Hmmm...Bear Makret is real. Dont lose money. Sell.Sell.Sell #sell #stocks #wsb #bearmarket #tradewars #optiontrading
246 2018-11-24 20:10:44 No, I just read everything I can on the subject. I hold some oil stocks and need to follow everything if I'm going to continue to hold them.
247 2018-11-24 20:08:13 On another note my 401k is looking nice. Gonna start playing with stocks real soon.
248 2018-11-24 20:07:27 In 2008-09 the stock market crashed 50%+. Did that stop people from investing in stocks? No.
249 2018-11-24 20:07:04 If Bernie and Alexandria are correct, we should invest in Funeral stocks.   We’d make a killing.
250 2018-11-24 20:06:07 3 stocks per game in 25 minutes is bonkers for someone his age. As soon as the 3 starts falling at an acceptable rate (I’m confident it will), he is gonna be a juggernaut
251 2018-11-24 20:04:50 Doesn't much of your research rely on using past data to generate predictions. E.g. unlikely that stocks will not go up over an X year period. Or how about quant factor based investing. These all suffer from the tbp problem no?
252 2018-11-24 20:04:37 You mean the bump stocks and magazines?
253 2018-11-24 20:03:14 Agreed. Tax cuts may prove to be a temporary effect though. Stocks?
254 2018-11-24 20:03:07 Bump stocks were used in one crime, “Assault Weapons” account for less than 0.5% of shootings, UBC means the .gov gets a say if I loan or gift a gun to family and friends. 
Do try to come up with a plan that will actually reduce crime.

258 2018-11-24 19:59:32 Two stocks to look at: Apple and Amazon are very far down compared to the last few months
259 2018-11-24 19:59:10 I wouldn't buy any stocks now. All the gains since 2016 have been wiped out in a few fell swoops.
260 2018-11-24 19:58:26 $NFLX  this stock along with The DOW is on the same track and all FAANG stocks are on track with a good meeting with trump as G20 comes
261 2018-11-24 19:58:09 he tweeted this:TOP AIM STOCKS? @smallcappick · 8h8 hours ago    Replying to @Sbb1x @Petro_Matad #MATD   TALK is we have an #oil strike  news will be here soon??
262 2018-11-24 19:57:39 Also, POTUS can't do SHIT about gas prices. Saudi stocks + worries of world economic growth made OPEC sell off.

TOP AIM...WAS THIS A LIE? YOU TWEETED IT
264 2018-11-24 19:57:00 I want to congratulate @FSUFootball seniors for being the worst senior class in fsu history. 3 straight years of quitting in games. 4 straight years of getting your QB murdered. Losing the most acc games since joining the league. An making @fsu the laughing stocks of ncaacf
265 2018-11-24 19:54:28 Funny, my Republican father is complaining that his oil stocks are taking a dive and he'll have even less money to pay for my mom's nursing home. I guess that your president is responsible for him losing thousands of dollars it took him a lifetime to build up.

267 2018-11-24 19:52:55 Hi there, we’re sorry to hear you’ve been disappointed. Our Kevin the Carrot toys have been very popular this year, so stocks ran out quickly. Keep an eye on our Twitter feed for competitions to win some toys. Thanks
268 2018-11-24 19:52:41 Even then, timeframes matter and my edge is deep analysis. I can tell you with some confidence that a majority of the stocks I focus on will show significant growth over the coming years. Rome wasn't built in a day.

270 2018-11-24 19:50:41 Wait, did Obama take credit for this economy? Didn't you Dems give it to him as well. As soon as the Dems take the house, stocks drop and now you give credit to Trump. Do any of you stand firm in any of your statements?
271 2018-11-24 19:49:56 Wow my 401 lost this year. Still up by thousands from 4 yrs ago.
So unless you yust started your 401 in 2018 your still ahead of the game. Ask all those poor soul's that cashed out when the stocks really crashed. If they would have let it sit they would have gotten it all back
272 2018-11-24 19:49:46 Fair enough, but it's probably harder to make money on stocks you recommend that go 50% down, instead of going up
273 2018-11-24 19:49:31 I’m hoping by late-2019 to be back in a position to invest in individual stocks. I was very good at it for a time 20 years ago. Back then I owned Amazon and Pixar. If I’d kept my head out of my ass I’d have a lot of money right now. :)
274 2018-11-24 19:48:25 Your premises are completely off and on that basis, your criticism is void! Consider that my guidance isn't as simple as telling someone to buy all these stocks a year back, and as a result, you can't draw any conclusions from a bunch of charts.
275 2018-11-24 19:47:39 And the right can’t be?

Assault rifles available to everyone including the mentality ill and people on the no fly list. Bump stocks and parents buying guns for 3 year olds. That’s not silly, it’s deadly.

I’d err on the side of silly then die on the side of stupid and dangerous.
276 2018-11-24 19:46:46 Also I didn't mean to sound like an ass. User input and experiences are of course important. I just deal a LOT with internals, trade Intel and AMD stocks (I don't pick sides), etc. Knowing your needs fairly well too, I think 2700X will make you very happy.
277 2018-11-24 19:46:26 How are your stocks doing Trumpy?
278 2018-11-24 19:43:49 You have sexy nice levely long leg's so beautiful in stocks 
279 2018-11-24 19:42:29 “People die every day! You know what’s really horrifying? Your stocks are going to drop!!”
280 2018-11-24 19:42:21 How this headline is going to read in the Times in 6 months: “Drug Companies stoke fear of insulin shortage, raise prices. Stocks remained normal in warehouses, sources say”
281 2018-11-24 19:41:24 There are no bad stocks. Just bad people who buy stocks.
282 2018-11-24 19:41:23 And she also tells us that said bad deal is worse than no deal and that we'll have no Brexit. How can leaving the EU be worse that staying in it, shackled to the stocks the EU has clamped us in? How can trading on WTO be worse than being subservient on their terms at our cost?
283 2018-11-24 19:41:20 I'm not saying they should've "gone for him in that role" you're deflecting. I just would like to hear the whole story. People seem willing to put Plecas in the stocks and throw tomatoes at him without benefit of the whole argument. I'm not saying Mullen shd've been a replacement

286 2018-11-24 19:39:46 The money business is efficient. Don’t like the manager or the report card you can switch. Thank god since they all follow each other and own the same stocks and follow the same strategies. Embarrassing!!!
287 2018-11-24 19:39:29 Estamos aqui a comparar notas porquê? Vamos todos para o continente repor stocks às 6 da manhã, provavelmente morrer aos 25 com um tiro de caçadeira nos cornos após depressão clínica de vários anos

291 2018-11-24 19:33:12 Yes I have seen the stock market and I was able to buy some stocks at a very good price and build up my retirement portfolio with blue chip stocks.
292 2018-11-24 19:32:44 Sorry, lol  Read your previous tweet to me(common mis-strike for me)? How about Miguel Stocks-Salazar from Portland... Ken(Toppie) & Janet from Coos Bay... Tom & Katie from Springfield... Mike & Sidney Portland... Karen was in Klamath Falls? All Stocks? Always a surprise!!

295 2018-11-24 19:28:03 All of then can be easy if you have proper education with someone master patterns and strategies , back to your question for me , i like trading stocks more than others because its easy patterns

302 2018-11-24 19:20:24 You should sell and exit the market. Perhaps better luck in stocks?

304 2018-11-24 19:18:33 In 2011 my full bull market phase trend model bottomed with 7 stocks remaining. We're not nearly in that same market condition yet. Could get better. Could get worse. The bottom line is this market isn't bad compared with 2011

311 2018-11-24 19:13:50 I don't see people freaking out about oil crashing $USO. Weird. I have seen posts of people going long.  Oil fell over 7% Friday, the biggest 1 day % move of this ~34% crash since Oct 3rd. If stocks fell 34% people would be panicked. The calm is disconcerting. It will ripple IMHO
312 2018-11-24 19:13:40 hello utilities k kon kon s stocks hai? any idea.
313 2018-11-24 19:13:13 This holiday season brings record sales but retail stocks are not doing at all. This means consumer sentiment is strong with low unemployment rate yet these 2  man-made ( as u said repeatedly) themes are creating risk around the wrld; Recomm: need patience & learn from data

319 2018-11-24 19:09:20 On a price to earnings basis, Apple looks pretty appealing among the FAGMAN stocks right now (never got why Microsoft was excluded from FAANG, so there's a new acronym for ya!)
320 2018-11-24 19:09:15 Anyone trading with technical analysis buying right now? Just wondering looking at charts, most stocks/indexes are breaking down.

323 2018-11-24 19:06:16 It's not very wise to try to make a living buying lottery tickets. 

Considering the ratio of failed penny stocks to sucesses, I would just short a basket of them if I could hedge it.
324 2018-11-24 19:05:14 These contracts with weight watchers & the renewal with Costco better go thru so these stocks can be worth a damn was about to invest before, the homie @SwishaShock  Advised against it tho and was correct
325 2018-11-24 19:03:57 I don’t think people realize how big having 3 stocks is for cloud. I CANNOT wait to get gimped at 0 and only lose 33%’ of the game rather then half!  Having 2 stocks to work with after a gimp or early death is SO MUCH better then 1.  I think it helps clouds comeback factor a lot

331 2018-11-24 18:56:35 ARs do have larger clips, collapsible stocks and shorter barrels..making them “deadlier” than the other two
332 2018-11-24 18:55:15 I’ve made plenty. Get with your advisor and pick some new stocks. Sounds like you’ve made some bad choices
333 2018-11-24 18:55:01 @Abhishekkar_ Is there any scanner where we can find stocks above Resistance 3 or  below Support 3 levels?
334 2018-11-24 18:52:28 Je puis d'ailleurs vous indiquer qu'il est régulièrement demandé aux magistrats de justifier du maintien dans leurs stocks de dossiers anciens.
335 2018-11-24 18:51:59 News like this doesn't help pharmaceutical stocks and the politicians/lobbyists that work for them.
336 2018-11-24 18:50:36 Thanks for coming down. Hopefully there will be more.
337 2018-11-24 18:50:13 I'm hoping too bro. Let their stocks plunge
338 2018-11-24 18:49:42 Has absolutely nothing to do with the fact P/E ratio on tech stocks were above 30 when fair value is more like 10-15. Nope, corrections are never needed.  Look up the Buffett indicator and P/E ratios.  Fed is raising rates.... meaning no more 0% interest rate share buybacks. 
339 2018-11-24 18:49:03 @GreaterGameplay  saw this great show the other night with the wonderful @Tom_Stocks who was fantastic (as were all the cast) Scenes moving from joyous camaraderie to despair of war. Very moving. Hope it goes further @Adammorley7 #theatre #newwriting #actress
340 2018-11-24 18:48:41 Stocks are regulated on the federal level,so until marijuana is legalized federally only a fool would invest in it. The SEC will seize all of your assets.They won't sift through and figure out what's legal or not.
341 2018-11-24 18:47:13 Once you’ve got $10k saved, take $2500 and put it in reliable stocks.. keep building that as you gain $, and then you’ll have enough of a foundation for an investment advisor to meet with you.
342 2018-11-24 18:46:43 Then Gold is real money no need to focus on mutual funds or stocks. N need to build real businesses.

344 2018-11-24 18:45:34 Its more of global shocks than internal shocks. @nsenigeria succumbed to fresh sell Pressure as #Stocks down 1.18% 4d wk.

362 2018-11-24 18:28:55 Look at fucnburge,he sold half of facebook stock he had prior to the stocks big drop,didn't Martha stewart goto prison for insider trading,no one can't say he didn't know before selling millions before his stock took like a 20 % loss
363 2018-11-24 18:28:55 A unit of account of reasonably predictable value over time facilitates long-term contracts without a prohibitive risk premium. This is entirely separate from how those units ($100 bills) are best invested to preserve or enhance wealth.  My preference is risky stocks, worldwide.

367 2018-11-24 18:25:58 Trump. Heard of that guy? Trump said he supported banning bump stocks after the Route 91 Vegas mass shooting, but hasn’t done anything in the 13 months since. 

I’m guessing the $30 million gift from the NRA has something to do with it. 
See why we don’t like the NRA?
368 2018-11-24 18:25:21 1. ML for Central Risk book trading. How can one leverage metrics such as VPIN observed at a single stock level to optimally trade a portfolio?

380 2018-11-24 18:17:21 November 2018 may be even worse for stocks than October was- This is looking like the worst year for stocks in a long time!

383 2018-11-24 18:15:02 They are well on the path to extending their bond buying to *buying everything else*, hyperinflating the Euro, reducing all debts to zero, and reissuing either a new Euro or reverting to national currencies.   If the Swiss can buy stocks with vapour....
384 2018-11-24 18:14:49 Also Tom, speaking of viewing the future, how are those gold stocks you recommend doing lately?
385 2018-11-24 18:13:39 Yes. contemporary society is less comfortable with striking and picketing workers. We say suck it up, and don’t throw tantrums when you don’t get what you want. It’s turning back though. When stocks go up, record profits, but full time employees can’t afford an apartment.
386 2018-11-24 18:13:37 apple stocks rise by 35%.
387 2018-11-24 18:12:30 Well, stocks plummeted and crypto shit the bed so...I'm guessing something like that.

389 2018-11-24 18:10:43 Stocks go down, CEOs fire employees to keep their same income, economy stays trash. Stocks go up, CEOs pocket the extra profits, people still don't spend because they have nothing, economy still trash.

Capitalism in a nutshell.
390 2018-11-24 18:09:31 If its to much risk and you want certainty, stocks have no certainty.

Maybe find something that does ?

Its happened 2 years in a row, and not on the same days or even the same months or even the same stocks at the same times.

Nov/Dec shippers in 2016 & 2017 went up, thats all.
391 2018-11-24 18:07:00 I would not buy stocks with your money
392 2018-11-24 18:06:00 There are no bad stocks. Just bad people who buy stocks

394 2018-11-24 18:05:18 11/24 Stocks down 3.0% last week after down 8% during 10/18.    Europe, China and and Interest rates were lower.  Gold was higher.  Oil tanked.  With lower inflation, Fed may hold on interest rate increase.  . Cryptocurrencies tanked and VIX (investor concern) was higher
395 2018-11-24 18:04:01 It will be so good can’t wait!

399 2018-11-24 18:00:34 Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like to go to avoid the labor of thinking.
400 2018-11-24 18:00:34 Original intent didn't envision bump stocks, but did precisely specify a scope and a purpose: Limited to well-regulated individuals, for the preservation of the free state. Just being an 18 with a pile of cash does not mean you're well-regulated. I want to see more than that.

406 2018-11-24 17:59:46 11/27 - Reduce "Short" positions in stocks  Stock negatives are moving averages, wealth index, & investor confidence.  BUT technical positives are near long-term support, very oversold condition.  Also Economy is strong.   Oil price decline - Fed may delay interest rates hikes.
407 2018-11-24 17:59:08 I'm talking about the stock market and the economy. There's no denying that tax cuts help big companies. As evidence by the rise in Infrastructure stocks post election.
408 2018-11-24 17:57:26 Non non, je pense que ton ressentie est juste. L'état à fait le stocks d'armes anti-émeute, Manu va pousser le curseur au max pour valider l'avènement d'un état totalitaire. Bientôt des point de contrôle un peu partout. #LREM
409 2018-11-24 17:57:11 Economic downturns are fueled by fundamentals. Nothing any president can say will stop it. Trump helped big company's through tax cuts, giving infrastructure stocks a boom post election. The Federal Reserve is responsible for raising interest rates.
410 2018-11-24 17:56:04 What a pity. Just in Black Friday 

online sales 6.22 billion. That's an all-time record! Visa stocks going to fly Monday.
411 2018-11-24 17:55:19 I feel they each cater to a different audience. Tradingview is easy to use for newbies (retail flipping stocks for pennies) where @StockCharts appeals to students of the craft. Plus you gain access to legends such as Martin Pring and John Murphy as an example. I also use TC2000.
412 2018-11-24 17:54:30 When she announced what she IS going to do, stocks dropped.  The left literally want to nation to fail.
413 2018-11-24 17:54:16 If you just look at the headlines on Zero Hedge, it's nothing but negative fear porn. Yes, the tech stocks are over valued, and corrections happen, normal cycle.
414 2018-11-24 17:53:58 We found this out when I was looking at stocks for my daughter to purchase. I was amazed!
415 2018-11-24 17:52:59 Nature damage growth is a bad thing. As for the shrinking economy i can say who cares. The nl stocks also took a beating. But tell me Mr Brent Spiner when we finally will what is the biggest environmental impact. Boat's, cars, planes, extra solar rays form another solar system?
416 2018-11-24 17:51:28 How many ways can you say "NO ONE wants to infringe anyone's right to bear arms per the Constitution!" NO ONE needs to bear an assault rifle unless they are law enforcement/military. We need to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and better monitor gun sales! Listen and learn!

418 2018-11-24 17:50:15 The following need to occur:

Ban on bump stocks
Ban on commercial sales of assault weapons.
419 2018-11-24 17:47:46 40 down over 3 days during a sell off and a long term down. I know from your tweet how much you must have put into stocks.

425 2018-11-24 17:44:37 I've gotten a few ABEV stocks
426 2018-11-24 17:43:44 I'm not sure to be honest. You keep the qualification and the flight test but maybe have to update your ops manual.
427 2018-11-24 17:41:07 LOL.  When regular people do it, it's illegal manipulation; when central banks do it (with QE, rate suppression, and outright buying of stocks, index futures, and volatility shorts with fabricated money), it's doing God's work, or something like that.  : )
428 2018-11-24 17:38:59 There is a lot of gold left, but is is uneconomic to mine ATM. So we mine about 3000 tonnes, which is about 1.5% annual increase (inflation) on existing stocks.
429 2018-11-24 17:37:30 Your in a good position to do it!  if didn't renew one year is it back to the beginning and start from scratch again?
430 2018-11-24 17:37:02 What are you talking about. Stocks have been going down in a nose dive for months. Inflation is on the rise. Home and car loans interest are thru the roof. He has ruined our economy with that stupid tax stunt and added one trillion more in deficit.
431 2018-11-24 17:35:41 No I haven't actually but that's a great idea. I bet loads of people are wondering about it in farming
432 2018-11-24 17:35:22 Like in stocks high risk, high reward. Only catch is, you always get rewarded.
433 2018-11-24 17:35:20 Looking at ETF PSI for example I see a 1 year top with leadership such as NVDA and MU in near free fall. Same with energy WTI down 6+ % on Friday alone.  The rate of change on these declines with what I see as casual selling so far is alarming.  #equities #stocks #inflation

436 2018-11-24 17:33:41 Ouch! Don't think I shall be doing it then, the 130 a year to renew kills it for me unless making a nice little earner but I doubt it. Thanks for explaining. Have you thought of doing an article on the PfCO explaining the ins and outs.
437 2018-11-24 17:33:12 In 18 yrs, I hv never seen @ManUtd playing as bad under Stupidenho. If u dont sack him ASAP, we will lose more than 8% of our stocks.

Get off twitter sicko
441 2018-11-24 17:26:58 Yea you do a theory course (2 days £1k) then pass an easy exam. Then you have a flight test which is a mock job. Then you submit an operations manual to the CAA (£250  for the honour). Think It's about £130 every year to renew. Insurance is cheap through Flock

443 2018-11-24 17:24:31 As investors we must understand that equities are still one of the best assets no matter what the "charts" state.  Stocks are the only asset class that continue to produce more value once owned.  Commodities and currencies amount to at best speculation. #investing #stocks #alpha

445 2018-11-24 17:21:00 I don't know enough about the CFP to pass comment. Id imagine the whole policy needs to be reviewed on account of it not being fit for purpose anyway since the stocks are still being depleted (or thrown back in dead)

451 2018-11-24 17:18:33 The stock screening thing is a bit odd.  Last year's 2017 growth stocks screen generated an average loss of 9.7%.  This was excluding the Patisserie Valerie pick.  They have decided to exclude it as it is suspended.  Could just write it down about 90%.  Very questionable.
452 2018-11-24 17:18:29 Ok lol guess I'll look into stocks

457 2018-11-24 17:15:42 My IC take of the week.  Cover story is on small cap gold stocks (i.e. a rubbish area to invest).  They admit this in the feature.  Saying only one gold stock has followed the price of gold.  What is the point having the lead feature article about a junk sector and junk stocks?
458 2018-11-24 17:15:09 @Apple has enough to buy back all stocks and go private. Power moveeeee

460 2018-11-24 17:14:10 The great thing about any economic downturn is the ability to buy into positions at the entry point you've been waiting for. Real estate, stocks, commodities, and crypto all have bear periods.

481 2018-11-24 17:01:52 Apple just had their most profitable quarter and year ever. Apple makes money, stocks go up, people sell stocks making themselves rich, which then makes Apple stock go down. Then they buy the stocks again.  Never mind the 1/4 trillion $ that Apple has sitting in the bank.

494 2018-11-24 16:53:25 I'm all for strict regulations on guns, banning high cap mags, banning bump stocks, uni bg checks, etc. But a society needs a way to protect themselves and their families, and many people hunt for their food, which is also OK.

506 2018-11-24 16:46:07 Stocks have been updated, so Apple still leads by $26 billion, but this is still evident of a larger issue for Apple. Earlier this year they were the first trillion dollar company. Now Microsoft, a company that predominantly works with software, is beginning to encroach (1/2)
507 2018-11-24 16:45:23 Climate change ? Lots o' money to be made in underground dwellings, elevated dwellings, vacations to Mars (ha, ha)  insulation, sump pumps, solar radiation & fire proof suits, aqua lungs, and other safety equip, eh ? I'm buying stocks in all that shit !

510 2018-11-24 16:44:45 You sure? Man United stocks fell to a 10 year low.
511 2018-11-24 16:44:35 The stocks were updated again.
512 2018-11-24 16:43:57 What happens to this strategy when the market volatility is over. Any stock (w/ options) that has been volatile in this meltdown would have won. $BABA is just one, may be a better one. Tech stocks like $aapl, $nflx all have been volatile with big swings
513 2018-11-24 16:43:52 Hi Amber. I was hoping you could enlighten us on bump stocks and gun show loop holes? There has been plenty of time for you to google both and call yourself an expert on the subject. Anyway, not trying to harass. Was hoping for some honest dialogue 
514 2018-11-24 16:42:52 SUM (whew!) 
Market massively painful place for most last week, except those who raised significant cash early or are short. Bonds not helping much. Defensives faded. Global stocks down. Cryptos smashed. A lot negative YTD or moving that way.
515 2018-11-24 16:42:26 ... yeah sure. That's how you solve hunger, health, and general inequality issues. Let them eat stocks.
516 2018-11-24 16:42:21 What happened to hanging...or stocks....or plain old clap em in irons. Sadly now we have entitlement...and human rights...and Facebook
517 2018-11-24 16:40:51 There are loads of instances. Eg EU law means that many thousands of fish are caught and discarded dead each year - which depletes fish stocks and benefits no one. As a member we are **not allowed** to change that law for a better one

NSEL scam happened as there were no stocks. It was a money lending platform with no asset backing.

524 2018-11-24 16:36:15 In 2015, the interest rates were still 0 % and even the though the US QE was just ending some of the other central banks like ECB were still in full throttle. Swiss bank was buying stocks like APPL and goosing the overall market. S&P index was around 2000 then.

532 2018-11-24 16:32:58 I miss home. I miss my Mama, my Abah, my bed, the kitchen, the grocery trips I make with my brother weekly to buy stocks for the house. I miss cooking daily, I miss being in a room with someone 24/7.
533 2018-11-24 16:30:23 On technical like an important candlestick pattern on daily chart with trend reversal divergence on one of the nifty 50 IT Stocks suggest a buy call,  but other factors as pointed out by nitin Sir in this video must be given heed before going ahead.

538 2018-11-24 16:24:56 Give me a break we’ve had pneumonia for 10 yrs. These guys don’t care. They just manipulate stocks higher whenever they want. This 10 yr fraud was like I said many times the longest fraud bc things are just slightly better economically. Def not supportive of these valuations

p.s.: don’t calm me child sweetie.
542 2018-11-24 16:22:08 Its not blind loyalty I don't even know the last time I went into an Adidas store. I'm being subjective. Look at their quarterly earnings or stocks. They're not losing money.
543 2018-11-24 16:22:00 is one of the filters "stocks above 200-sma"?  if not, what caused it?
544 2018-11-24 16:21:36 Wanna buy stocks in my company? 
545 2018-11-24 16:16:15 My approach is to have Netflix, but boycott all Obama’s crap. It’s best we watch the good stuff as a team. Soros has already dumped his Netflix stocks. Get it, watch their wholesome shows. Boycott their crap. Rating will win out. Capitalism is an excellent weapon.
546 2018-11-24 16:15:55 Wife and I hunting and shooting SAFELY for ove 50 years!Likewise-strengthen background checks and dump bump stocks
547 2018-11-24 16:15:15 But we have been saying for 10 yrs now stocks should have never ever went this high. The American ppl are suffering. Very few jobs, no wage increases, super high inflation in housing, property taxes, colleges,services,healthcare, etc. I repeat these crooks pushed stocks higher
548 2018-11-24 16:15:13 I think bitcoin and stocks were quite heavily discounted on Friday? The whole past month actually . But nandos is a stretch

553 2018-11-24 16:10:49 The EU's fishing policies decimated the natural fish stocks
554 2018-11-24 16:10:34 My 2 experiences of having someone “flip money” for me always backfires I’m better off investing that money into stocks or my savings account.

557 2018-11-24 16:07:04 It's a biased prediction. They were being hyper bullish because each one of them were holding significant bags of BTC. Buffett dood was calling BTC rat poison because he has significant holdings of Banking stocks. He is worried if BTC goes mainstream that might affect his stock
558 2018-11-24 16:06:40 Cool. I wasn’t aware presidents could cut gas prices. Also, stocks are down 2000 points. Did he cut those as well?

561 2018-11-24 16:00:17 @Tesco are the instore Black Friday deals likely to be restocked or was it while stocks last?
562 2018-11-24 15:59:36 1) $WUC was REALLY cheap in the spring. Cheaper than it's peers imo. We've had a pullback along w/ most U stocks... and well- most stocks period. There are many potential catalyst in the next 4mo. WUC opening up the smc, AMT, milling uncertainty, & of course the results of 232.
563 2018-11-24 15:58:17 I have a Mavic too they are amazing pieces of kit and so portable
564 2018-11-24 15:57:32 To answer your question bump stocks mimic an automatic rifle. Gun shows skip the background check.
565 2018-11-24 15:57:09 I think the Mavic Air is really your entry level if you're going to use it professionally? Anything less is gonna be pushing it in anything other than perfect conditions. Factor in training, licence and insurance too. That adds £1.2k
566 2018-11-24 15:56:58 Yeah pretty much a noob attack in disguise with high stocks

573 2018-11-24 15:42:27 No. I want people who make money by trading stocks to share more of the burden presently. People a who sock money away through 401ks, IRAs, etc should be rewarded for their efforts to save for retirement, as they will be less of a burden on the Gov later.

576 2018-11-24 15:41:34 Yes, we confiscate all rifles, ARs, bump stocks, rapid firing automatic rifles.  Build a hunting reserve and issue those particular guns to people who claim they OWN WEAPONS TO HUNT.  Hand-guns are acceptable to protect homes and businesses.  Also, STOP illegal ARMS DEALERS.
577 2018-11-24 15:41:32 Congress members are the only ones who can legally commit insider trading. Example: John Kerry when knowing ObamaCare was being passed bought millions in stocks in big pharma and banked big time.

586 2018-11-24 15:37:05 How is this different from calling people stupid for buying stocks 2 months ago. Or buying gold 7 months ago. 

(Psst.. all these charts go back further than that)
587 2018-11-24 15:36:45 People just sucked at combos at the start and played the game like it was brawl. That combined with the fact that the only serious competitive mode was 2 stocks (for glory) probably swung people towards 2 stocks more
588 2018-11-24 15:35:45 @jimcramer how do bank stocks perform in a falling (yes) interest rate environment?
589 2018-11-24 15:34:21 In investing I don't like a lot of leverage. My rule of thumb is to divide RO(Equity) by RO(Assets) to get the ratio of assets/equity. The higher the #, the more leverage - a smaller % asset impairment is needed to wipe out equity. My stocks average 2.5; banks are ~18+. So yeah

593 2018-11-24 15:32:47 I actually agree with the broader point which is that btc is less speculative than for instance oil. Youre right that stocks and bonds shouldn't be compared with BTC at all.
594 2018-11-24 15:32:00 The next financial collapse will end paper fiat forever.  No more cash.  Crypto and Gold will share the re-investment of money from stocks, bonds and real estate.  Trillions of dollars will flood those asset classes.
595 2018-11-24 15:31:16 @POTUS Dear President Trump, as you may know, GE stocks are at its lowest level now. I was wondering if you can play your trump card to save this Iconic American company which has the highest level of technology for the airplane engine, powerplant, and healthcare equipment.

600 2018-11-24 15:27:54 Pointless comparison. To take all onchain volume as separate "use" is nonsense. How much of the onchain volume involves exchange wallets in support of speculation?

The entire purpose of stocks and bonds is to increase in value so I can't imagine what he's thinking there either
601 2018-11-24 15:27:22 Honestly. What a joke. Paying for their system issues. Unbelievable.

604 2018-11-24 15:24:00 Went today to service center and it was replaced with new power bank. Good service. But request you to make stocks available at every service center.
605 2018-11-24 15:23:43 I've been short LOTS of stocks since June. I've made money on all of them.

"Then why keep wasting your money on shorting $TSLA"? 

LOL! Generational opportunity to add.

607 2018-11-24 15:19:49 Crude oil prices good for consumers. However, oil prices fall to far oil companies must shut down rigs, and layoff workers.
Besides, oil stocks fall. Those unemployed can't pay their bills and or mortgages: housing market falls and U.S. Economy suffers, at worst a recession.
608 2018-11-24 15:19:43 If you want to ‘consistently’ ride 10-50% moves in a very ‘short’ period of time, focus only on stocks closer to their 52week high point. DISCARD everything else. @iManasArora

It's making me glad I decided to "play it safe again."
611 2018-11-24 15:14:59 Collect a small percentage sales tax on Wall Street transactions.  You pay sales tax.  Oligarchs who buy stocks and bonds and derivatives (that sometimes throw the country/world into financial ruin) should also.

623 2018-11-24 15:03:19 Thats not entirely accurate. That depends on the company, the brokerage and you you can hold stocks for centuries if all the parameters are right.

639 2018-11-24 14:56:29 Whatever happened to the 10% tax cut Trump promised after the midterms?

It must have slipped his mind like his promises to drain the swamp, ban bump stocks after Las Vegas, release his tax returns once in office and get Mexico to pay for his stupid wall.

643 2018-11-24 14:50:33 I would have been more supportive of them if they hadn't been so hard-line and if they had been negotiating in good faith about bump stocks and so forth.

As it is, I wish them nothing good. @NRA is welcome to drop dead.

645 2018-11-24 14:47:51 #cannabis The current downtrend around the world in cannabis stocks has at least one good point. Most of the weak hands will have been flushed out leaving us with strong investors waiting for the next catalyst to boost prices with hopefully little selling.

648 2018-11-24 14:46:21 I suppose for GOP Senators, any legislation depends on how much money they are getting from the Pharma companies -- just like they aren't willing to address gun control (not even bump stocks) because they get so much NRA money.

700 2018-11-24 13:52:34 Incidentally, the EU's approach is now to treat BFT as a stock to be managed given the rebound in stocks. Even environmentalist groups concede a certain level of exploitation is reasonable now. Thankfully conservation worked. Ireland should have a share of a sensible quota.

704 2018-11-24 13:50:01 Yes, we'll said. Adding on that - Almost 95% of the returns in the markets anyways come from your behavior. Rest 5% come from the stocks you choose. Focus on the behavior ! You will always perform well :) Simple but difficult.

711 2018-11-24 13:41:47 It is by design that no president has any power over the price of gas or stocks or anything. That would not be capitalism. That would be Soviet-style communism. The president does not set prices.

716 2018-11-24 13:35:06 Correlated? Growth of crypto should've been inversely proportional to growth of stock markets.

Either big players aren't totally aware of how crypto works or someone's trying to make us realize that crypto is correlated to stocks & wants us to sell be4 upcoming financial crisis.

747 2018-11-24 13:08:49 Stocks, bonds, real estate......forget them all. No safer investment on the planet than betting against Texas A&M in a high-profile late-season game.
748 2018-11-24 13:08:05 I think it’s not that hard to be right about a stock. There are just too many stocks, too much movement in price & fundamental value. Everyone just has such a small picture in a given point of time. And one week later it’s all different.
749 2018-11-24 13:07:06 Pension returns are determined from a mix of assets and I never argued that stocks are less risky. Using a Treasury rate (riskless) to discount future returns when the Fed has suppressed rates for almost a decade is not legitimate. And I get some people like annuity returns.
750 2018-11-24 13:05:14 You mention the word "assault," and there's your definition: an offensive weapon.
Extended magazines, flash suppressors, collapsable stocks, laser sights, drum magazines...all weapons of war. These have no place in sport shooting or home defense.

752 2018-11-24 13:01:57 Its not question of time horizon. Its about capital. He is investor, so he will keep getting capital to buy stocks on each draw down whereas retailers will not. So its better to wait & buy since retailers will have limited capital.
753 2018-11-24 13:01:52 It has happened to me!!! I have had weird emotional ties to a security...really just a collection of 1's and 0's on my computer screen.

758 2018-11-24 12:55:57 Eysh they were my type of shoes before I know All Stars, are they still in stocks tho?
759 2018-11-24 12:53:51 I've been in the market over 25yrs and one of the many things I've learnt is that it's best to let a reputable & capable fund manager oversee most of my nest egg.
This is the reason we invest in stocks like Berkshire Hathaway. No way I'm outperforming #Buffet.
760 2018-11-24 12:52:14 There are good stocks and bad stocks . Then there is one category which is stocks which you will never understand. The good thing is you just need a few of good stocks to have great results.

771 2018-11-24 12:32:02 Evidently, you have been taken in. To believing, trickle down economics works. Corporations do not care about employee wages. Which have been stagnant, for decades. They just buy back stocks,& give huge bonuses to executives.
772 2018-11-24 12:31:15 It’s feds job to be concerned. If we’re like the Fed we will only invest in treasuries. All the same, CLOs should be restricted to sophisticated investors, if you don’t understand the risk don’t go there. Funds manager are not responsible for the risk of stocks they sell.

774 2018-11-24 12:30:12 Pay close attention to the stock market- there is no more “bagmen” it’s all trades stocks and then off shore funds. It’s being done in front of us, we will see what can be done. Trump can take credit for that stock market and when it crashes he can that too.
775 2018-11-24 12:30:08 Because the stock mkt weighted theses stocks, they rose higher than they should have & in a downdraft will go down more also

1005 2018-11-24 07:04:08 True, but our batting stocks are dire, considering no YK and Misbah. I’m banking on Fakhar Zaman providing some decent starts and Azhar/Shafiq doing enough to win one test match. That’s good enough for me.
1006 2018-11-24 07:03:15 Financial advisors and top business school executives would keep on comparing Adani group with ADAG group but fact is, Adani group will keep on disappointing all those people. Adani group stocks are best performers in recent correction.

1016 2018-11-24 06:55:41 A simple but effective solution:
Link farmers&consumers!
Eliminate middlemen.
Invest in cold storage&refrigerated transport.
Remove the distortions in pricing, let consumers and farmers talk to each other, decide the cropping pattern, acreage. 
Move the surplus to buffer stocks.

1024 2018-11-24 06:42:49 That’s how the rich stay rich. They use charities and foundation to not pay tax on capital gains, write off huge donations that they get back from the charity investing in stocks. IRS legal too. Better than off shore accounts!

BREXIT historic events ...yo-yo moves in European stocks and currencies Pound and Euro !
1027 2018-11-24 06:39:26 We should see 85-90% decline in all non-cyclical stocks from its peak price.  Be ready for it.

Remember even NIKKIE index fell 85% from its peak registered in 90's,  yet to go past that. 

Our index may not fall more than 50% even in worst case but beware of stocks.
1028 2018-11-24 06:39:23 We don’t want fiscal stimulus. It did not help long term & it is still hurting our markets.The market does more to ameliorate a crisis than bureaucrats.

1030 2018-11-24 06:38:13 And they only have to spend 10% of the charity. 90% they invest in stocks, making a profit without paying taxes since they’re a non profit tax exempt. That how the wealthy stay wealthy. Use charities to both hide capital gain assets, huge tax write off and collect interest!

This is what professional traders do to something of intrinsic value.

That's how you build a healthy chart with plenty of support

1037 2018-11-24 06:26:09 So apparently someone at @DisneyPixar came up with the bright idea of having us all watch Mufasa die again but this time in HD. Has Disney bought stocks in tissue companies later?
1038 2018-11-24 06:25:53 Là, je ne comprends pas: l'augmentation est immédiate, stock ou pas. Quand le prix baisse, il faut attendre d'avoir écoulé les stocks

1040 2018-11-24 06:23:19 I think a lot of these companies are bubbles.  Hundreds of stocks have dropped 50 to 75 percents of their value.  There's a lot of issues that can sink good stocks, I'm short Tesla, just recently entered the trade not too long ago.

1059 2018-11-24 05:57:56 I am on my Uber back home and the guy next to me is reading one article about which marijuana stocks to buy.
#SanFrancisco
1060 2018-11-24 05:54:20 A lot of that investment has been made, and scale has brought the costs down for the majors. Anyway, I was pointing out relative strength in the Cdn oil patch for those still willing to tip-toe around in there, like myself, who combination invest/trades Cdn stocks.
1061 2018-11-24 05:52:31 Investment 101: Nifty 50 stocks bought and giving minimum CAGR return of 15% will not be sold, until they are through out of Nifty 50.

1062 2018-11-24 05:52:28 Because it is tokenized I can buy you 5 tokens at $10 each for $50.  

It is just like buying 5 shares of Twitter stocks.

Financial instrument tokenizations and Security token offerings (STO) might be the biggest revolution in the blockchain industry in the next 10 years.
1063 2018-11-24 05:51:54 Sounds like a plan. Move my 401k to cash, bonds, foreign stocks. Play money in $gdx and $sh
1064 2018-11-24 05:51:25 The dude made billions shorting stocks.  I bet he has spys in every major corporation.
1065 2018-11-24 05:50:59 Lets ask Bishop David about his stocks & the Catholic church they placed in blue chip companies. For sure theyre earning millions!
1066 2018-11-24 05:47:47 Along with technical reco. I suggest you to give stocks for long term to your followers.
This will benefit massively to all & will take respect to you &  your team to much higher level....
Only suggestion & not more then it.....
1067 2018-11-24 05:46:20 Its the norm in farming and really frustrating and expensive.  I shot a lot of cattle during the BSE incident in Canada that were fine to eat.  Sold a lot of perfectly safe edible Flax Seed to salvage for oil in China because of a GMO variety escaped into the seed stocks.
1068 2018-11-24 05:46:13 My #retail scouts tell me they are seeing upwards of 20% increases in sales yoy w/ larger than expected spending by younger consumers (interesting) and scarce parking at major outlets. $SPY #stocks #economy #jobs
1069 2018-11-24 05:45:47 If you believe stocks are less risky in long run, the price of a put option should fall with time horizon. Opposite is true. So people in industry are pricing the risk properly.
1070 2018-11-24 05:45:01 The only non-fuel chemical stocks I've seen are deicing additives for high-altitude flight (that are low-dose) and I guess I've never seen any chemical trucks around a base, let alone near an airframe, so I'm having a hard time understanding how this is all supposed to work.
1071 2018-11-24 05:43:47 With due respect, it is not really a good advise, specially for newcomer to invest now when market valuation is too high. I will suggest to wait for 6-9 months one can get better & bargain stocks which doesn't have to wait for 30-40 years to get good return.
1072 2018-11-24 05:41:21 Kinda funny. March saw the Obama’s and Susan Rice leap into programming & a Board Seat on Netflix

Shortly after, Soros dumps stocks. 

Almost like he might know their real capabilities.

Did I say my kid is not vaccinated? Did I say they Are innefective? Did I say anything of the sort? 

I ask why is it ok for the very people who own millions of stocks in these companies to tell us we need them.

1084 2018-11-24 05:34:21 So I only put $50 with uphold in XRP. I was wondering what you thought about BBC? I think it’s close to bottom. Are you watching any cannabis stocks? They low right now missing margin by half. The next one will be double digits.
1085 2018-11-24 05:31:30 after reading some replies... seems like shorting weed stocks is the way to go... on the otherhand 90's BoomBap HipHop may get it's comeback
1086 2018-11-24 05:31:18 Other way of looking at them is some stocks like vivmed which was trading at 80+till few months back recovering well in positive@market...
1087 2018-11-24 05:31:12 I started investing in stocks in 2007, added in the slump of 2018 and still hold some of the stocks i bought then...Bharat Forge, TCS, Tata Investment Corp, Petronet LNG (from IPO), Adani Ports (from IPO). Plan to hold them forever unless fundamentals change.

1092 2018-11-24 05:22:57  Only issue is that they can become even more undervalued or "relatively" less undervalued while falling in dollar terms because everything else is falling faster, e.g. stocks.
1093 2018-11-24 05:21:49 Record stock market? That tells me you don't have any stocks. Have a look - it's down for all of 2018.

For a person who doesnt design, I'd say it is fine overall. Im aware of the png character image over a random background with simple stocks and color overlay is still a thing in this day and age but I feel like it's good to start off
1115 2018-11-24 04:54:14 Yes in this context, "keeping an eye on" means "doing something". I think you have to accept the market risk in an index fund, meaning you take very little action. It is one of many strategies. Trading individual stocks is more of an active strategy.

1120 2018-11-24 04:46:29 Being invested globally, one thing is always seen as a common theme, even the so called educated investors are never able to see the realities in fundas/charts/developments without being biased .

1126 2018-11-24 04:40:48 "Business owner invests off-shore" citation needed. Most other countries buy US stocks and bonds, not so much the other way around. Also, does business owner not compete for labour all of a sudden? More money= can hire better/more workers, for more money than competitors.
1127 2018-11-24 04:37:54 Lmao you should do stand up comedy.  That's the best laugh I had in 6 years. Go buy stocks buddy . We'll see how that will work out in 5 years .
1128 2018-11-24 04:36:27 Stock market and money policies shouldn’t be mixed to a certain point. These are two separate things and if the actual system would come to crash, another one would likely replace it. Buying stocks with gold or money wouldn’t change a thing in their value. Ceteris Paribus.

1134 2018-11-24 04:29:58 USA Li ETF LIT LT charts look a big mess,my prop. LT momentum indicator pierced the Ref line downward just now. Stocks will take a long time to recover.

1135 2018-11-24 04:29:24 .. The interest will rise and also the tech stocks in particular r drooping like apple, Microsoft and other tech companies and that’s due to their failure strategy, so basically the investors feel nervous .

1139 2018-11-24 04:26:45 Yes that is true - although it’s poorly run IMO it defintely moves when Uranium does, Because of the marketing it gets - which is really important for stocks (can’t invest in something you don’t know about).

I may not like it fundamentally but it has a lot of leverage to Uranium
1140 2018-11-24 04:26:23 This would reduce the incentive for low income earners to increase their income by investing in high yield stocks given any interest or rental income they earn is taxed at their marginal tax rate which is lower than 30%.

1197 2018-11-24 03:36:17 Wonder where are the crypto investors/speculators deploying the money raised by selling all this crytp currency. Will some fraction flow into FANG stocks in US and emerging economies like India??
1198 2018-11-24 03:35:24 Would anyone of a certain age and intellect have all investments in high risk stocks?
1199 2018-11-24 03:35:22 that's exactly, I go 50% of investment to MF and not stocks directly.
1200 2018-11-24 03:34:43 Doubt it. High yield debt market about to blow up taking stocks and the economy down with it.
1201 2018-11-24 03:34:29 I feel it, this is certainly the sentiment of many in the community and with good reason. My view is that they are also the best marketers. If you're a generalist looking for #uranium exposure, $UEC will be one of the first stocks you find.
1202 2018-11-24 03:34:16 There just no reason to  really buy stocks

The boosts are potential and the headwinds are real, plus stocks are already pretty well valued.   I wouldn't say high because we now have low tax rates and relatively low int rates compared to history to justify it
1203 2018-11-24 03:33:10 sir, Good morning ! in one interview you had told that you are investing in 2 wheelers stocks.sir, are you buying  more at this point of time  2 wheelers company  stocks and which new sectors you are investing as of now ? your valuable advice .regards

1210 2018-11-24 03:27:30 I agree but stocks are the only asset class that is remotely close to the crypto market!!!
1211 2018-11-24 03:26:59 That's right. But *also* overnight changes. When stocks open down 5% , the straddle is up 40% on open. But, yes, Trade Machine uses end of day closing.
1212 2018-11-24 03:26:46 1. Gold had rallied almost 400% in 7 years to 2008. It has already fallen 40% since 2011, also 7 years ago.
2. Gold bottomed in Oct 2008, long before QE began.
3. When US stocks crash in next 3 mths, Fed forced to print again. Gold soars. Dollar already had its rally, down next.

1216 2018-11-24 03:25:49 I bought some stocks this week but only because I hadn't owned them so far.  I think we chop, get a hike maybe slightly changed commentary, but stocks keep having spasms for months until the FED really does change course

1226 2018-11-24 03:16:43 Avoid stocks.  Stocks down 3% this month after being down 8% during October, ignoring strong USA economic reports.  Europe/China were lower. Gold was higher,   Will fed hold off raising rates because of stocks    geopolitical events and trade wars.  Investors worried (VIX higher)
1227 2018-11-24 03:16:40 I am studying volume bars and found that scanner are not very good catching stocks with good number of shares. For example, let say, you found  a stock running slowly around 9:32AM. You are using 1 minute chart. Now, when the bar of 9:32 closed you notice that this bar was traded

1246 2018-11-24 03:01:24 i get the same thing when i bring up put option sales on @AmericanAir  and @united stocks at 3am on 9/11 or how the cores of the support beams on tower 7 were molten and cut at an angle. to be fair, i just bring it up without gramps prompting anything.
1247 2018-11-24 02:59:45 You can take your money out of stocks or in your 401(k) and put in into something say so you don’t lose all your money
1248 2018-11-24 02:57:58 Rotation trade would be commodities. If the commodity index holds support it will rally above other sectors imo. Treasury bonds and junk bonds at an inflection point  for move lower from a long term downtrend. Which will set the stage for stocks to tumble further. I like metals.
1249 2018-11-24 02:56:25 This is ironic. Diverging to political content during mid-terms, perhaps, to curry favorable attention in certain circles.

1253 2018-11-24 02:50:24 Let them go ahead and after the US is done with them I'm buying parking lot stocks in what was once Iran.
1254 2018-11-24 02:49:12 STOCKS:  Sell the rally?  Stocks are very "oversold" & may bounce especially if we hear mumbling the Fed may hold off raising rates.  This may be a good opportunity to sell.  Problem is World hates trump & is looking to do  business with non-USA based companies and HUGE DEFICITS

1257 2018-11-24 02:44:10 OVERWATCH ENTERPRISES stocks rallying
1258 2018-11-24 02:43:25 No they don’t.... you’re using survival bias. Most of the internet stocks never came back from the dot com bubble and are worth zero now
1259 2018-11-24 02:43:12 If they could save it now with one comment now, why couldn't they save it with one comment next year?

Stocks already topped and are down 10%, that's not small potatoes regardless of where your entry point is.

Have stocks ever dropped 10% without GDP growth slowing or declining?
1260 2018-11-24 02:41:53 Don't dare to short aviation stocks when crude is in bearish trend
1261 2018-11-24 02:40:59 This is how the elitists use disinformation. They love Facebook. They'll make money shorting stocks. Question everything.
1262 2018-11-24 02:39:12 Il va même nous filer ses stocks options le Phil Spencer si ca continue
1263 2018-11-24 02:36:57 I luv stocks because it’s the only big money game where you don’t need a product, customers followers or teammates. It’s all on you and your bankroll
1264 2018-11-24 02:34:46 There's no reason to not tighten restrictions up as many aren't being enforced IMO.  The loophole for gun shows needs to be closed.  No reason to have these assault rifle wannabes and bump stocks and was raised on target practicing and trained Labradors.  Not against guns at all.
1265 2018-11-24 02:33:37 1) I feel just fine.  Raising starting wage to $15 was a huge move for the Co .For those of us FT that were eligible for VCP, the max pay out was absorbed into our wage increase, so I am actually making $200-300 more a month.  Stocks are great, but I like cold hard cash, so...
1266 2018-11-24 02:32:17 Short hedges on $YM Dow Jones Industrial Average futures keeping portfolio stable today. Lots of volatility concerns out there. This equity market could make violent moves up or down from here. Few stocks meeting our criteria but still some opportunities seem ready.
1267 2018-11-24 02:31:56 Waiting for the day when Islamist-Leftist ideologues declare Hindu as equivalent to Taliban. That will really make their stocks soar in the fake liberal world.

1271 2018-11-24 02:28:47 Stocks that are traded long/short are owned by individuals, other companies and funds. it does not hurt them at all.
1272 2018-11-24 02:25:50 Yes, own stocks in AAPL, and I’ve earned thousands of dollars as a result of that investment.
1273 2018-11-24 02:24:11 He wanted the stroke, and I didnt want to make it really like all the other Fortnite revamps that have way to many stocks.
1274 2018-11-24 02:23:55 Don’t’ let the market’s broad moves overwhelm you. If you have good stocks with good fundamentals, don’t panic. Quality long-term stocks deserve long-term commitment.

1277 2018-11-24 02:20:12 all of these are not financial advices guys. most people are buying stocks on rumours. invest wisely in what u afford to lose.

1279 2018-11-24 02:19:27 There’s many ways you can get rich without networking. All you need is money to make money in stocks. Networking isn’t needed at all
1280 2018-11-24 02:18:51 I know a person who was not knowing about Balance sheet,P&L A/c but on advise of genuine person bought stocks i.e.HUL,Nestle,Castrol,GSK HC,Tata Chem,L & T in IPO or from market and held on since then.......rest is history.

While stocks last.
1286 2018-11-24 02:10:03 Your 401k, and stocks now that's a joke. Have you looked lately. You've lost everything you made this year.
1287 2018-11-24 02:09:59 Correction - my rule of thumb is 10-15% for a healthy correction. At 26,966 for the DJIA 10% = 26,966-2696=24,270 bottom. At 15% 26,966-4044.60=22,921.40 bottom. Shares of many stocks, not all, were overpriced. We are at 10% right now. We need a halt on Fed rates and China Tariff
1288 2018-11-24 02:09:30 Thats only true if you are buying broad market etfs MAYBE. Individual stocks go worthless all the time, and mutual funds routinely go from good to bad.
1289 2018-11-24 02:09:23 The kind that stocks the industrial strength anxiety meds right next to the cold remedies, of course.

But I really do think she'd be well advised to divide that pill into two and take with plenty of water.
1290 2018-11-24 02:09:15 STOCKS:  S&P down 3% for week & down 3% for year.  Republicans and trump's bad policies on international trade plus huge deficit borrowing of over $100 billion/MONTH are driving the world toward recession.   GOP stole from poor to give trump & billionaires from huge tax breaks.
1291 2018-11-24 02:09:03 Stocks are going to crash hard. I give it till 2020. Just in time for the elections...
1292 2018-11-24 02:08:03 Ha. Thank you. you never gave me hard time

Actually, I am so lucky; have never had one instance of troll or arguing politics or religion. I try to focus on the markets & stocks only

As long as you stay on the right side of the market, your account will grow like FL weeds 
1293 2018-11-24 02:07:55 Yep. I tell my mom, family, etc: “on average the US stock market has a recession every 5 years and the longest we’ve gone without a recession is 10. Were going on 11. Stocks are overvalued by definition (see Ben Graham formulas).” They say: “no it’s too risky to pull out.” What?!
1294 2018-11-24 02:07:52 Part2. The current stock market crysis on all world stocks is not just the beginning it is in fact a purge of all unsubstancial business models, like influencer kids.This current crash will be a good thing in the long run.Even it will be horrific in the first place.I welcome it.

If it is so, I guess its a secret. 

You have to stop believing only about financial profit for the rich! Lower oil prices is bad for who's economy........ says the stocks today.

1300 2018-11-24 02:02:10 Just invest in stocks
1301 2018-11-24 02:01:12 Maybe, but I’d choose @elonmusk, with all his flaws, yet with a dream to make a better future for mankind any day rather than a flawless businessman who only wants to fill his pockets and raise his stocks.

1305 2018-11-24 01:58:14 A ban on bump stocks, restoration of assault weapons ban, background checks for every & I do mean every gun purchase, a national gun registry, mandatory trigger locks (govt assistance for those who need it), elimination of gun free zones (a gun is safest when with owner), etc.
1306 2018-11-24 01:58:09 Bank stocks also taking a hit. So big tech, banks, and crypto all in a bear phase. None are illegitimate, all has a nice run and are now in the bear part of a market cycle. That is what is happening.

1317 2018-11-24 01:44:07 As I read your "...pathways to species conservation that had the least detrimental economic impact." it's clear you're not going to protect stocks from the offshore fish buyers of the rich.

1333 2018-11-24 01:26:41 Yeah, I'll seriously start considering around $3500. From that point more than a 50% further drawdown is highly unlikely in the short term given its transaction volume. In the same period, stocks could see similar correction levels but with a much more bounded upside.

1506 2018-11-25 22:21:13 I don't know? It's super interactive and full of company investment and stocks and dividends....good stuff
1507 2018-11-25 22:19:26 Yes I similarly like the 50 week moving average for stocks, and want to apply it to BTC but with some adjustments (research in progress). I prefer weekly to daily because it dampens the trading frequency and I only need to check charts once a week.
1508 2018-11-25 22:19:11 Si pasamos a impuestos altos a los stocks de acumulacion de riqueza no veo por que no podemos bajar los impuestos a la produccion. Es lo que hacen estas naciones.
1509 2018-11-25 22:17:53 Such as? They've had the kid gloves treatment it's not working. Maybe a birching  or a day in the stocks in front of a very big hose pipe.  Name and shame the little for rags!
1510 2018-11-25 22:15:25 Consumer discretionary stocks are typically strong when economy is strong & consumer confidence is high.  Recently these stock have been declining.  Consumer stables are viewed as a safe haven stocks where investors can put money in uncertain times.  They have been going up.
1511 2018-11-25 22:15:18 My aunts trying to help me get a job @ f*ceb*ok dndndn they apparently pay 18/hr just to go around refilling creal/drink stocks ect. 
1512 2018-11-25 22:15:06 One or two analysts calling stocks as tight as 07/08, looking through inflated Chinese and presumably subcontinent stocks
1513 2018-11-25 22:14:14 He had an exit strategy! lol. Is that why he keeps claiming this is the new low all the time and promising the people BTC will touch 20K. All investment in stocks/crypto is about fundamentals, just that you need to stop mis-leading people who may lack those fundamentals.
1514 2018-11-25 22:13:56 Stocks going down Audra
1515 2018-11-25 22:12:05 Love pumping weed stocks
1516 2018-11-25 22:11:48 Yes, all these scientists got together twenty years ago and decided to buy stocks in LED lighting and solar energy. Then they went back to work and started this whole climate thing....just to cash in. Right.

1522 2018-11-25 22:06:39 LOL you know that those bonuses were for show.  He should have given you direct tax cut because the employer is using it to buy back stocks.

Also, he didn't know what's in the bill!  He said he'll sign anything LOL.  He just wants his name on shit.
1523 2018-11-25 22:05:28 One cannot assume that such overall trends are significant. Suppose that, over a large bunch of stocks, there was some tendency for the trend of the first 10 years (months, days) to persist over the next 10.  Then regression would see that connection as influence of past prices.
1524 2018-11-25 22:05:19 2 stocks
1525 2018-11-25 22:01:47 Good now come to stocks and make some money
1526 2018-11-25 21:59:31 Feels like a real ugly day coming tomorrow for stocks.
1527 2018-11-25 21:58:42 1) Its 43, not 423. 2) Disney isn't a necessity & most of his pay is via stocks, meaning if it does bad w/millions of workers, he gets nothing. He oversees 60 BILLION A YEAR. High wages of someone w/access to that account is necessary. Or hire one who makes $10 an hour...
1528 2018-11-25 21:58:38 His attitude is the same as a penny stocks lol

I don't look very highly of him cause it seems like he's one of those drug using salary guys
1529 2018-11-25 21:56:29 If it's a market cap index and a bubble and the bubble stocks are in the index how are adjustments away from theses stocks accomplished?
1530 2018-11-25 21:55:22 I've been saying for years, we need to bring back public executions in the court yards of the nation. Also all for the return of stocks and pillories to shame the perpetrators of lower crimes.
1531 2018-11-25 21:54:20 Well, I am not sure I agree with that... In 1998 value and quality stocks did not participate in the tech bubble at all.  If you mean eventually a style or factor will have a bubble, if you stick with it long enough... Then maybe?
1532 2018-11-25 21:54:16 Populism is extensive globally atm, just look at the US. Bonds and stocks are underperforming in most western economies; so isolating Rome as an exception is not a valid argument.
1533 2018-11-25 21:54:01 The pain in property prices is just beginning! It will be all over after when prices fall at least another 30%, there are mass foreclosures by banks, and bank stocks have fallen by at least 60 per cent, then the bottom will be in.
1534 2018-11-25 21:52:50 I think 2018 will be transformational for a number of stocks, especially resource.Then i can’t wait for 2019, i have an exciting bucket list ! life is for living, make every moment count
1535 2018-11-25 21:52:04 New placement to survive? Still 200.000 stocks of XMG in my portfolio and I want receive profit after years of hopeness and promises. Back again...
1536 2018-11-25 21:48:36 11/24  FAANG Stocks took a beating last week with Apple and Netflicks dropping over 10%.  Facebook and Amazon were down 6%,  Alphabet was down 3%.  The stocks are VERY OVERSOLD and may bounce in the next two weeks.  Scary.
1537 2018-11-25 21:48:23 Listen to the recent interview with John Borshoff by Palisade radio. Long term contracts are expiring but utilities are betting they can buy at low prices. They will need to start signing contracts at higher prices soon. #Uranium stocks should see upward pressure in early 2019

1554 2018-11-25 21:36:30 Uh, that was a challenge to the facts. If you're reading a site about how statins are a conspiracy, maybe you shouldn't invest in drug stocks.
1555 2018-11-25 21:36:13 Totally agree! The biggest treat is that freezing Thames !! 
1556 2018-11-25 21:36:09 The Tech  sector is extremely oversold (6 on 10 space) with Apple, Amazon and Netflicks at almost 10 on the same oversold scale.    It will be interesting to see if theses stocks bounce this week.   SCARY times.

1558 2018-11-25 21:33:50 That was the result of the momentum from the Obama presidency, when stocks more than doubled in value from the lows in 2009 thanks to Bush. Let's see what happens over the next twelve months.

1563 2018-11-25 21:29:13 It is wrong that a government full of corrupt politicians become wealthy by insider trading, including pharmaceutical stocks, ... all while pretending they are outraged. Mr. Portman is among the most pretentious, while doing nothing for everyday American families.
1564 2018-11-25 21:29:07 US stocks closed lower in a shortened post-holiday trading session as the energy sector tumbled on continued weakness in oil prices, & the S&P500 confirmed its 2nd correction of 2018. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 37 points lower at 5,666. #ausshares #stockmarket
1565 2018-11-25 21:28:35 Trump loyalists are authoring their own nightmare. Everything they complain about; immigration, failing stocks, confrontations with foreign officials, their bad policies caused all of this. They had the majority of everything and look what happened.
1566 2018-11-25 21:28:20 Yeah, none of the stocks climbed to more than double their 2009 value and unemployment didn't halve from 10% to 5% in the same time during Obama's presidency. But it is no surprise that a republican would try to blame Democrats, even tho the market has been falling for months

1568 2018-11-25 21:26:25 WTH are you babbling about? Oil prices are higher than previous 2 years and trust me that is NOT like a tax cut. Try food shopping. Take away FOOD TAX.

- always stands for what he believes is right,
- joins the army to defend his country,
- is put in stocks for unlicensed publishing,
- offers to kill Oliver Cromwell,

He’s not your man. He’s 17th century leveler John Lilburn
1572 2018-11-25 21:20:31 It is the not knowing when it all comes to an end. Currencies still have some real trending prospects. Stocks are like... Just short for the mean! We should love trends. Remember the dotcom boom.
1573 2018-11-25 21:18:46 @QuornFoods Whats going on with stocks of frankfurter sausages ? All the supermarkets in our area (east midlands) are out of stock...… :(
1574 2018-11-25 21:18:33 Are right wingers seriously this uninformed?
No longer use your own brains or eyes?
Trees, birds, water don't lie.
Big oil and meg polluters and those that profit from their stocks DO.
1575 2018-11-25 21:18:21 No its because the greedy capitalist corporations that were going to reinvest & raise wages. Bought back stocks instead.
1576 2018-11-25 21:17:56 ....you’ll see how seamless companies and countries can create digitized assets (stocks, gold, CBDCs)...built in exchange system to allow people to trade in the network. Than dig a little through the institutions, banks and nations already building and active on the testnet
1577 2018-11-25 21:16:01 You can’t legally trade stocks. And you still owe over 40 thousand dollars to the people you ripped off. So how are you affording all this coffe and petrol? You should get a job and peddle there.
1578 2018-11-25 21:15:07 Yes. A great masterpiece. 
1579 2018-11-25 21:14:41 Lat week they said you would run out of FOOD. The week before it was something about your POWER grid. Before that it was STOCKS plummeting. Now you're going to run out of clean WATER?  Control using a Campaign of Fear. Run out of the EU!
1580 2018-11-25 21:14:12 Oil prices are down because the market is faltering. It's not down because of the Saudis. Stocks are over priced and people are afraid of trade war. The farmers already have been hit. Starting January we're gonna all feel the effects of the trade war.
1581 2018-11-25 21:13:34 The holding period for stocks recommended by 20 Punches will vary and, while nothing is guaranteed, will generally be 1 to 2 years.
1582 2018-11-25 21:11:53 More,from the river of pain, focus your mind, praise the Lord, if you stop chasing a rolling penny stocks, and pain,,now focus on the good and lovely, in your life,,therefore, stand and see this great things which the Lord will do before your eyes,,,wealth,riches will be in house
1583 2018-11-25 21:11:08 Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.73%, or more than 175 points, and the S&P 500 shed 0.65%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.48%. Friday's close marked the worst Thanksgiving week for US stocks since 2011.
1584 2018-11-25 21:11:02 And the stock market has lost all gains for 2018, stocks on Black Friday as bad as back in 2010, Trump Tariffs will erase any gains from lower oil
prices. Tourism is way down because of this president.

1588 2018-11-25 21:09:39 I don’t know? Perhaps they are checking stocks in the cellar?

1590 2018-11-25 21:07:42 "Since you can pick the same character for the 3 stocks it doesnt change anything." 

Like bruh, do you realize it will change match ups, stage advantages, and counter picking.

People are trying to hella rush it in instead of thinking how much will change because of it.
1591 2018-11-25 21:07:16 Inequality is worse, than it's ever been. Keep letting Goldman Sachs, dictate policy & laws. Tax Scam Bill, is an example. Corporate Tax is way too low. They take their profits,& reinvest in stocks. Trickle up, is more like it!
1592 2018-11-25 21:06:48 Wait CNN will be all over it when they start gunning down these invaders.
1593 2018-11-25 21:06:26 My god bruised ego or what?  I was just saying why don’t you bet more on less? Just like investing in stocks you don’t buy everything just the ones that have the edge... anyway good luck, keep betting 10 games a day 
1594 2018-11-25 21:06:00 Yeah coins like PK will be good long plays in this strategy. Short plays will be in stocks.
1595 2018-11-25 21:05:25 Some are laughable. true. There are two types of prices predictions (in stocks, commodities and crypto alike). Fundamental analysis and Technical Analysis.. FA better long term FA short term. FA is in its infancy... needs more data for correlation. TA is what’s left.

1599 2018-11-25 21:04:08 Despite quiet markets on Friday due to the extended US holiday weekend we saw the USD gain some ground across the board with Oil off over 7% on the day and stocks closing lower. The highlight of the weekend was the EU/UK agreement on how to move forward after Brexit.

1604 2018-11-25 20:59:12 Problem is, nobody wants to come to a tournament to play "special singles". If someone already solo mains a character, they're not gonna enter singles and then go to play squad strike and pick three stocks of the same character again. SS is dead as a side event.

also hi miggy :)
1605 2018-11-25 20:58:35 @farrisbaba Hi Farris, your story is very inspirational. Which is easier instrument to build a small account from your experience, stocks or options? Assuming you follow the rules, etc. Thank you
1606 2018-11-25 20:58:17 Just like asking the opposition for their opinion?? May could get us a trillion in gold stocks from the EU and Corbyn would still say she’s getting her pants pulled down.
1607 2018-11-25 20:55:54 As for stocks they are much higher since his election, and if you had any knowledge on the market, you would know that stocks need a Correction like this, more so when the economy is performing like it is, Bec that creates higher interest rate (making money expensive)
1608 2018-11-25 20:55:53 Happy I don’t short any stocks. Trolling fan sites then blowing up any issues seems like a sad existence.  No cars are perfect. However, I really like my Tesla. May buy another one. I don’t need shorts to tell me problems about my car that has no problems.
1609 2018-11-25 20:54:46 The rich pay next to nothing. Especially with Trump giving huge tax breaks. That's when they aren't embezzling it, hiding it in foreign banks, and buying back their own stocks while screwing workers out of a livable wage and healthcare. Giving them more money makes them hoard it.
1610 2018-11-25 20:54:22 Ah yeah neither of those are that great for Lucario then, the resetting of % in crew battles constantly letting him go back to a fresh 1 stock vs 3 is what made him so reliable. Although he can certainly still put a dent in a new character's stocks if he's starting with damage
1611 2018-11-25 20:53:09 You didn’t mention how we have massively overfished over decades so stocks are only at around 1% of what they were 200years ago and nobody even understands what a healthy marine ecosystem looks like any more.  Brexit won’t affect that.
1612 2018-11-25 20:52:57 $Gold and $EEM are making higher lows in November. US large cap stocks to follow. US small cap stocks didn’t make a new low last week. Looking up till Christmas to me... $SPX $RUT

1620 2018-11-25 20:44:29 It's rubbish. Even countries in Africa keep substantial stocks - I know this from first-hand experience.

1622 2018-11-25 20:43:41 If you are looking to invest money. Buy Ethereum crypto or Amazon stocks. By the end of 2019 you will be 5 times
1623 2018-11-25 20:43:24 Funny you should ask because I have some clients who think crypto is “safer” than stocks. To answer your  question yes, I do. The blockchain and financial product part is what needs to be clarified for people if crypto has a future mass adopted use case. Still too much confusion.
1624 2018-11-25 20:43:23 >> no prejudice against stocks of failed or nearly-failed companies. On the contrary, they are attracted by the higher volatility of those stocks.  

Juas as they *love* bitcoin...
1625 2018-11-25 20:41:00 Tech has two markets (old stocks & new FAANG).  Until recent big declines, FAANG have been darling of rally.  Aurospace/Defense also has been very strong because of GOP & Trump's talk about need for strong defense.  But budget deficits may limit further large defense spending
1626 2018-11-25 20:40:58 >> Those are the "penny stocks" that are used in pump-and-dump penny stock scams.

Beware that the Investopedia article is written for stock "gamblers" (day-traders) more than for long-term investors.  Since day-traders don't care about fundamentals, they have no prejudice >>

1632 2018-11-25 20:37:59 Okay, there are SOME companies whose shares are technically "penny stocks" for the SEC, but are not quite empty shells.

But the number of shares is usually chosen at IPO so that the price is $10 or more.  A stock that is selling for $0.05 has lost at least 95% of its value. >>

1634 2018-11-25 20:36:08 I don’t think that’s it. The book I’m thinking of examines case studies of boom and bust cycles of markets and individual stocks. It showed the commonalities between a wide variety of situations. You told me about it around 2000.
1635 2018-11-25 20:34:19 Rant anywhere you would like. All stocks all the time is unhealthy. Just dont create a third persona. Two per person is my max, 
1636 2018-11-25 20:33:53 Yes because Robinhood doesn’t offer withdrawals. They could hack the account itself, but in that case your stocks would be exposed too.
1637 2018-11-25 20:33:50 RESULT:  Goals from Stocks and Norcross continued the Development Squads brilliant start to the season as they beat a well organized, @BFCLadies Devs. We hope our visitors had a safe journey home. A brilliant advert for the @FAWNL reserve league! 
1638 2018-11-25 20:33:41 We are the news. We now have to be. We share. They have been fired.
1639 2018-11-25 20:33:11 Not just lions. It's happening here too to stop predators killing our precious hunting stocks.
1640 2018-11-25 20:33:03 Hell yeah! Then prosecute and incarcerate. But, let’s put them all in stocks first, so we can throw as much refuse at him as he has at all of US.
1641 2018-11-25 20:30:50 I agree. 

plotted some stocks for minimum 10years history. 

Observed general tendency and behaviour.
1642 2018-11-25 20:28:29 But if it gets to the media somehow stocks might be affected right? Maybe that'll signal him to do something?
1643 2018-11-25 20:26:19 What you usually do is send out Lucario halfway in to clean up against someone - 

Typically you may lose 1-2 stocks, and go into the next round with hella aura, and good Lucarios can just straight up reverse 3 stock peeps with that.
But Lucario is HELLA strong for it.
1644 2018-11-25 20:25:44 I read it merely as a short term "Ouch", not a writing off. Stocks that have risen most strongly will often take the brunt of a marketwide sell-off, as holders safely bank their biggest profits. ;-)
1645 2018-11-25 20:25:14 Sosnoff’s law (Humble on Wall St)  Stock price varies inversely with the thickness of its research file. The fattest files are found in stocks that are most troublesome & will decline the furthest. The thinnest files are reserved for those that appreciate the most. @chriswmayer

1648 2018-11-25 20:23:03 No they decrease rates to increase liquidity. This puts a floor under stocks but expands the feds balance sheet. This expansion is inflation.
1649 2018-11-25 20:22:41 ETF holds the asset it tracks & has to be a basket of stocks,equities and fixes income.
ETN is more like a bond. It's an unsecured debt note issued by a company & if the underwriter goes bust, the investor risk a total default. It can hold physical assets but mostly../1
1650 2018-11-25 20:22:31 Thought it said "stocks" for a moment.
1651 2018-11-25 20:22:28 Who all are into stocks?
1652 2018-11-25 20:21:38 For instance, if the Nasdaq is below its 200-day line and its 50-day line, it may be worth looking into stocks that are above their own 200- and 50-day lines. When the market turns up, those stocks could be your next market leaders

1660 2018-11-25 20:13:33 Following the 2020 elections, just before President Trump begins his second term, and in spite of the final 2 months of House Majority by the Dems, the simple fact that Trump is re-elected will once again cause stocks to rise.  Then for two months they will take credit for it!
1661 2018-11-25 20:13:26 Lucario's stock aura is based on the remaining stocks of each player, not just how many the  Lucario player has lost, or he would actually be broken in Squad Strike LOL

1673 2018-11-25 20:02:37 >> Except that penny stocks are regulated by the SEC, which does not let empty companies issue more stock at pumped-up prices, and sends Belforts to jail when it catches them.  Whereas in Bitcoinland...

1680 2018-11-25 19:57:07 European large caps tend to be concentrated in banking, utilities, telecommunication and industrial conglomerates and integrated energy stocks. These are sectors that always warrant lower multiples due to a more stable and mature nature of their cash flows
1681 2018-11-25 19:56:46 >> Since they stand for nothing except the shares themselves, penny stocks are worthless and their price should be $0.  But they are usually traded for a pennies because there are always suckers who buy them. >>

1684 2018-11-25 19:54:47 you can pick the same char for all stocks? i don't see a point in taking advantage of squad strike then, gonna be suboptimal to not play your main for all stocks
1685 2018-11-25 19:53:24 Lol yet you trade bio penny stocks
1686 2018-11-25 19:53:02 Currently r/smashbros is pushing to have Squad strike be the main mode or at least replace doubles. They are using the point that now that its confirmed you can pick the same character for all 3 stocks its fair to everyone since solo mainers arent forced to learn 2 other chars.

1691 2018-11-25 19:46:35 Same story with stocks. Crashing all week long
1692 2018-11-25 19:45:57 Crypto.  Outside of the tech sector stocks ain’t bad
1693 2018-11-25 19:45:43 with that size of an account, goal is simply to LEARN. so just use very small size & learn to trade. practice with that small account to learn discipline. use 500-1k max size on stocks under $5 if u trade that and 50-100 size for large caps just to learn. lose no more than $500
1694 2018-11-25 19:45:18 If things are so great, then why are stocks down?
1695 2018-11-25 19:44:11 Calling crypto a scam is like calling tech stocks a scam. It simply isn’t. The only difference between the 2 is that crypto’s development and application is in its infancy.

1697 2018-11-25 19:42:55 Down turn in oil is within the context of a clear global industrial slowdown so Trump piggybacks. Stocks run up post election, he piggybacks. Stocks turn down, his messaging pivots and he piggybacks. Trump doesn’t control mkts anymore than any other president.

1707 2018-11-25 19:35:06 Thank you President Trump for falling oil prices.  I know how hard you worked to make that happen.  I assume you did something otherwise why would you be bragging.  And thanks for it being sunny today too.   Can you make stocks go up tomorrow too?

1727 2018-11-25 19:24:03 True. You are right in pointing out this scenario... still not all stocks are valued on current ability to pay dividends either. P/E ratio is different in between companies and in between years. Yahoo! actually got problem in monetizing their search engine and profit
1728 2018-11-25 19:21:30 Do you know the meaning of modest? Why have stocks fallen low? What’s happening with healthcare? Stop fabricating the truth. No tax cuts for the majority of Americans.

1748 2018-11-25 19:01:26 @Andy_Hoffman_CG Andy:  Remember when you bared your (Miles Franklin) soul about gold mining stocks 10+ years ago?  You lost a fortune then. Now you are doing the same thing regarding cryptocurrencies.  Get into cash now until the dust settles in this correction.
1749 2018-11-25 18:59:33 11/24 Kaine System -  90 day Treasuries may be best investment today.  Stocks (trade wars) & Long-term Bonds (deficits) are risky.  Treasuries rallied recently.  Decline in oil prices &  rise in dollar give Fed room to pause on interest rate increases when they meet in December.

1752 2018-11-25 18:56:27 Yeah but lucky for me, I’m starting to invest in the stock market and I believe if I can invest in the right companies and I could get big time shares off of little small valued companies and get big time stocks and big time shares as well.
1753 2018-11-25 18:54:07 I think @andrewrsorkin from cnbc is right, right now the tech stocks are hurting and most Silicon Valley folks are probably selling off their crypto to make up for that loss.

1756 2018-11-25 18:51:39 Far right? Ahaha you obviously have no idea what “far right” means in terms of political spectrum. Its the leftists who dont pay any taxes, FAANG stocks for example and the Clintons etc. Sex workers are All Radical Leftists. If not pay taxes they are just also frauds too.
1757 2018-11-25 18:50:20 They certainly could be still 90% overvalued from here :) my thought is it's stupid to get excited about 10% dip in stocks if they are still overvalued and/or if you are trying to build extreme wealth, you want to buy when things are very undervalued
1758 2018-11-25 18:49:54 In the interest of full disclosure I was an registered rep for 14 years.  Did not sell stocks and wouldn't.  Market is a scam.  Never had a violation or complaint.  Ever.  Niether did anyone under my direct supervision.  My opinion not advice.
1759 2018-11-25 18:49:06 So Macron says unless we let the EU plunder fishing stocks piecemeal we will remain In the EU customs union... Really... Perhaps he should feck off with May... We've been sold out completely let's leave on WTO terms noe
1760 2018-11-25 18:49:03 Are you kidding? You lost a brother to gun violence & U support a guy who’s bought & paid for by the NRA? There’s been more gun violence under Trump than any other president. He’s supported by white supremest, promotes violence, won’t ban bump stocks & licks NRA boots.  #rethink

1762 2018-11-25 18:48:09 Do as you wish. Let the business do the talking & next time you make claims of shorting such a thinly traded stock please share a snapshot of your short cause I do not believe it. Brokers do not allow endless short positions on such thin stocks, but you should know that!!
1763 2018-11-25 18:46:11 as I told u many times, anything is possible. BUT, remember it was a) massive QE which helped this long stretched bull market, now we have 8hikes + QT. b) low rates = buy back share programs funded cheaply c) the last move was driven by a handful tech stocks, while breadth not.
1764 2018-11-25 18:45:24 @PeterLBrandt are you looking at the Solar markets at all? I’d like to get your TA opinions on stocks like $CSIQ, $FSLR, $SPWR, $TERP

1766 2018-11-25 18:44:30 Stocks, bonds and commodities are staging a rare, simultaneous retreat, putting global markets on track for one of their worst years on record and deepening a sense of unease on Wall Street.
1767 2018-11-25 18:43:32 @DavidPatersonca I think I'd be buying the oil stocks now. The panic has reached audible levels.
1768 2018-11-25 18:43:29 You still got those stocks?
1769 2018-11-25 18:41:20 يارب حلمك يتحقق مع وربة 
1770 2018-11-25 18:40:53 $AAPL News driven or not, 100 weekly SMA at 169.26. Failure to hold can push price towards 165 or even 160. My initial target on monthly is at 134.54 - prior BO zone from 2016. Also 200 SMA on weekly 140.75. If it gets nasty over a period of time 120-118. 

#sssvenky #stocks
1771 2018-11-25 18:40:28 Thanks! One follow up question: why is it that most factor research uses time series regressions on portfolios instead of cross sectional regressions on all stocks and then average the results over time? (I think this is the Fama-MacBeth approach?)
1772 2018-11-25 18:39:13 Vraiment à peine 11h01 et les stocks de tous les produits de la vente flash étaient épuisé. Ne parlons pas de la chasse aux trésors impossible de débusquer cette fameuse moto à 6k
1773 2018-11-25 18:38:41 Stocks, land, debt... you pick it
1774 2018-11-25 18:38:02 $KGKG by definitely one of the elite OTC stocks. No dilution. No debt. Products on shelves. Rapidly expanding and increasing sales. Its perfect for holding and not worrying about pancake flipping!!! I know Sunny and Fin and others called it perfect a while back. Lovin’ it
1775 2018-11-25 18:37:02 Stocks down, national debt up. Horrific job you are doing!!
1776 2018-11-25 18:36:55 Prediction: stocks open lower again on Monday.
1777 2018-11-25 18:36:11 What's epic to one investor/trader may not be epic to another and there's a selloff. Buy the rumor sell the news has always held tru whether it be stocks or coins. If it's tradable it's the rule and rarely the exception.
1778 2018-11-25 18:36:08 What about all your oil companies’ stocks falling with these low prices.   Again, stupid understanding of the big picture
1779 2018-11-25 18:35:56 I brought most in this evening and will sort wean weigh and clip tomorrow. Never thought id get to end of November. Silage and straw stocks are much better than expected now.
1780 2018-11-25 18:34:56 Tech stocks have lost s year of gains Facebook because of foreign access and Apple because they can’t sell A I PHONE! Shit is crazy

1783 2018-11-25 18:32:27 $ISRG Another name holding 50 weekly SMA. Also the smallest looking inverted hammer (potential) on daily at 200 SMA. 500-505 watch initially, room to 518-519 (weekly 21 SMA).

#sssvenky #stocks
1784 2018-11-25 18:31:09 #Stocks,#Indexes So SPX completed a portentous but anomalous, therefore action precluding, top signal. BUT: SPX also perches on the cusp of completing a conventional, and major, top signal as well. Completion of this signal is likely Monday, 11.26.18.
1785 2018-11-25 18:29:54 those stocks were real businesses, crypto is just hollow promises
1786 2018-11-25 18:29:29 TransEnterix  inc has Senhance robiotic system ,I was wondering if you were referring to that that’s one of the stocks I invested in
1787 2018-11-25 18:29:10 Only that the tax cuts benefitted mostly corporations and most of them just bought up more shares of their companies with that windfall. Few raises for us. We got spare change. Unless of course you own millions in stocks. I know I dont
1788 2018-11-25 18:28:55 Any mention of stocks falling so much that all gains for the past year are gone? Nope. Crickets.
1789 2018-11-25 18:28:18 Stocks-n-Options Thank you for following me!!
1790 2018-11-25 18:28:15 $GOOGL has been chopping around & not breaking down. Holding 100 weekly SMA so far. Inside & down last week. If bounce does occur, 1064-1078 zone first. Room to 1100-1115 (weekly 10 EMA / daily 50 SMA).

1794 2018-11-25 18:26:04 >> That is why valuing stocks by the market price alone is like evaluating trucks by their color and shape alone...
1795 2018-11-25 18:24:16 Yeah, you got a point there. 2008 wasn't the time to buy stocks. Took a year or 2

1797 2018-11-25 18:22:24 @harmongreg hi Greg, long time follower. have U done work on strategy of selling Covered Calls on Buy n Hold portfolio for income. These r index etfs and/or dividend stocks. Never sell so no downside risk. Always roll up/down/out for credit/brkeven, so never assigned. Pure income
1798 2018-11-25 18:20:37 Depends upon the argument or claim. Federal rules outline what can be heard in federal courts. Many are graveyards for homeowners. Judicial Watch posts federal judges financial disclosure statements. Look up your USDC judges & see how much bank related stocks they own first.
1799 2018-11-25 18:20:30 Bitcoin below $4,000. A lot of speculation right now that cryptocurrency is slowly tumbling towards an end as a viable financial system. I disagree. Relative to the recent dip in near all tech stocks, the drop in cryptocurrency isnt so bad. 30d - Apple drop= 23%+. BTC drop = 29%.
1800 2018-11-25 18:20:10 Ah pardon, mea culpa, ça m'avait échappé. Les stocks doivent donc être en effet bien pleins. 
1801 2018-11-25 18:19:20 100K IS very much a possibility. Precious metals look firmly bearish, stocks could really take a deeper dark turn next year, what is left? A resurgent crypto market would suck up that capital, as it is visible. Weedstocks too. It could get really wild and bizarre next 2 years.
1802 2018-11-25 18:17:37 Of course stocks will go up when corporate tax rates are projected to drop. That doesn’t make it a good idea
1803 2018-11-25 18:17:32 As much as I despise Trump and hate every action he takes, the economy isn't dependent upon the stock market. Thats only the economy for rich people. It says something however that he gave rich people tax cuts now they're taking it in the shorts on their stocks.

1805 2018-11-25 18:16:17 $MSFT Another name I am watching for a pop next week. 105-106.50 range next week. Holding over 200 SMA constructive but more so if it can hold over weekly 50 SMA and retake 40 SMA on this timeframe. 

#sssvenky #stocks
1806 2018-11-25 18:15:49 The economy has peaked and has burned through the sugar high of your misguided tax cuts to multinational companies Donald... you’re running a trillion dollar deficit and the  economy is running on fumes... and you’re taking credit for cheap gas? How about cheap stocks as well?
1807 2018-11-25 18:13:59 Thanksgiving break’s almost over... stocks due tomorrow... we will work on presentations on chromebooks tomorrow in class...
1808 2018-11-25 18:13:50 AAPL down to $175

NVDA at $144

MSFT back down at $104

NFLX back down at $258

i love how tech stocks have just fucking died

and i dont even think its much to do with the market. theyre all just performing like shit.

1810 2018-11-25 18:13:40 Unless stocks build substantially?

Not sure if there is any space left globally to store it.

1812 2018-11-25 18:12:29 Samantha, to add to what Jax said:

1. Wages still suck
2. Record debt increase in 2018
3.  Who said the Korean War is over?
4.  Not the largest or best tax cut in history
5.  Record high WH turnover, & indictments.
6. Stocks lost all 2018 gains

Want more?
1813 2018-11-25 18:10:40 Why would stocks build unless KSA et al don’t cut?
1814 2018-11-25 18:09:56 don’t give up
1815 2018-11-25 18:09:05 For the record, I panic sold Amazon at $8 during the 2001 crash and I believe it went down to $5.50.  I also didn't rebuy Amazon back either.  

I was wiped out after the 2001 crash and was devastated. I didn't want to buy internet stocks for a few years afterward.
1816 2018-11-25 18:07:01 Faang stocks lost over 1trillion in value since peak. This affected ppl's 401k's. Fed will hike rates in December. 14k Dow fast approaching. There are bigger problems going on than #bitcoin right now. Corporate debt and 21 trillion missing are just a few.
1817 2018-11-25 18:06:30 What if crypto is even more sensitive to fed rate hikes than stocks are?
1818 2018-11-25 18:06:08 The effects of his Billionaire/Corporate tax cuts boosted the market with an avalanche of stock buy backs. That's now over & stocks are in free fall. This is the beginning of the forecasted recession. Trump's already blaming Democrats for his own stupidity.
1819 2018-11-25 18:05:43 Only losses if realized.  Take the longer view.  If you dont have a longer view, you shouldn’t be in stocks to begin with.
1820 2018-11-25 18:04:54 @PeterSchiff How do I buy stocks of Gold Miners like Kinross
1821 2018-11-25 18:04:28 There’s no market that moves like Bitcoin. You cannot apply Bitcoin movement to stocks.
1822 2018-11-25 18:03:49 Yeah but I bet there's a member of parliament  or their spouse/family members with shares/ownership in a company that stocks water purifying chemicals.
1823 2018-11-25 18:02:12 A case of #FakeNews show the graph of how far stocks have gone up since Trump became POTUS. The unemployment figures have gone down. There’s more minorities working. POTUS is addressing the #Caravan Invasion. D Higher taxes & more Regs don’t work. #MAGA
1824 2018-11-25 18:01:15 Given that Spain will veto any future free trade agreement unless we concede Gibraltar sovereignty and France will do the same unless we give access to UK fish stocks, how do we get out of the backstop?

1830 2018-11-25 17:57:21 @BBCCountryfile Farmed salmon is a very dirty business and the activities of salmon farms are not only affecting their own stocks but wild stock too. Another 'food' being made unfit for human consumption.
1831 2018-11-25 17:57:07 stop silly goose. I used a simple, common sense mechanism for $LTC ........and used it on stocks over my 20+ year trading career....."when an insider sells, I sell!"   Only use it on large chunks of their ownership. Wasn't / Isn't rocket science.   Not impressed, sorry :)
1832 2018-11-25 17:55:56 Listened to your podcast on Life in the Stocks. Loved it. Perfect Sunday listening. I admired your outlook on life, love and everything in between. Keep on keeping on.

1835 2018-11-25 17:53:22 And stocks tumbled and wiped out all gains for the year.
1836 2018-11-25 17:52:46 I am a wealthy enough dog. I own stocks.  I know exactly how much it went up in 2017.  I am also aware of how much it is down.  Business cycles ebb and flow, mostly independent of Presidents BTW.
1837 2018-11-25 17:51:51 Actually, those who have played/watched me can help. What are my weaknesses? I already have a small list:

- Airdodging too much in disadvantage
- Rolling too much
- Struggling to seal stocks

Any additions?

1841 2018-11-25 17:50:17 Thanks for the tax changes that gave the largest corporations that extra cash to buy back their stocks.
1842 2018-11-25 17:48:05 Haha!!! I’m more of a Buy because I’m keeping and hands on my stuff kinda guy... to a certain degree... like stocks you never know what’s going to hold value, what’s not... never want to have to find buyers either... like real estate, they call the shots in a pinch. Love Comics!
1843 2018-11-25 17:47:10 Its no coincidence that $CRON and $WEED are 2 of the best performers over the last few years and ALSO have a catchy ticker name  keep that in mind for the next mania/ when america pot stocks really get going
1844 2018-11-25 17:47:05 Always spot on with @Crypto psyche. Thanks for your leading activism, it’s much needed. May I say that zero sum game is in all kinds of stocks trading & not just the @Crypto trade. No? @crypto however are way more intense & fast evolving with global investors compared to stocks

#satire
1861 2018-11-25 17:34:51 Guess. I hadn’t thought of of the total bust situation. Rather like some internet stocks with some residual value, that may pan out later. Technology is interesting. It may go bust if drugs were legalized tho. Also like acceptance will fall during the slide, reducing demand.
1862 2018-11-25 17:34:46 I personally think bitcoin is. Far from over.

Can you spent with you stocks papers no
Can you spent with you bunch of bonds papers no
Can you spent with your #bitcoin yes
Can you mined #Crypto yes

So #hodl,it's an asset.
trade on it if you think can spent w it.

DnT sell it.
1863 2018-11-25 17:34:45 Stocks are plummeting, people are losing their investments.  How come you're not talking about that Trump?
1864 2018-11-25 17:34:30 Of course, President T leaves out that stocks are in the Red this year and there may be even bigger sell offs coming...
1865 2018-11-25 17:32:45 President Trump warned that the stock market would go down if Dems won the House.   Haters like you didn't listen.   Who's fault is it to keep stocks in your 401K's?
1866 2018-11-25 17:32:14 "The dollar is a pyramid scam", "all stocks are gambling", "value is subjective", "the market price is the value" -- those are standard lies that investment scammers must tell their marks to prevent them from asking "WHY is this worth $3500?" or "where will my profit come from?"
1867 2018-11-25 17:32:05 you can tell your pension broker to invest in specific stocks if you wanted to
1868 2018-11-25 17:31:17 Shut up for one day. Stocks are terrible so you need something else to try to take credit for? You are slime!  I’ll thank you if you resign.
1869 2018-11-25 17:30:41 Thanks,hmm so you basically filter your stocks daily on parameters like Vol, Gap and then look for more likely scenario to your best setup that is in play for the day? So you kind of trade same setup across several stocks? Does your method fall into the category of Price action?
1870 2018-11-25 17:29:49 Yeah and all those Wall St. dudes are just gossiping about stocks and whatnot.
1871 2018-11-25 17:29:41 I remember a year ago telling people I was going to start getting into stocks and they dismissed it as a mugs game before declaring “But crypto, now that’s a winner.” Would love to know how much they’re down now 
1872 2018-11-25 17:25:51 You Theresa May work for no one. You are a nasty liar and should be put in the stocks.

1880 2018-11-25 17:18:19 Agreed. A useful analysis, @BrandTrapper, for anyone evaluating domain name investing versus stocks, bonds, crypto, collectibles, a second job, etc.
1881 2018-11-25 17:17:05 Ressones they make the stock so high cause Radio active beast mode was a disaster unrealesed time so they put faces on high stocks because of that most faces now
1882 2018-11-25 17:16:53 The tech leets def own some IDK outside of that. Anyway this market (stocks, crypto, real estate) is bearish for forseeable future. Tweets won't change that just time. Have good day Matt.
1883 2018-11-25 17:16:38 Stocks are a leading indicator. Unemployment is a lagging indicator
1884 2018-11-25 17:15:01 Even though value stocks outperformed the S&P 500 vast majority of 10-yr periods since 1928 (81% of the time), the range of outcomes around the average was extreme:

Best = +11.9%/yr

Average = +3.3%/yr

Worst = -4.9%/yr
1885 2018-11-25 17:14:57 I know 99.99% of you kids who are trading or investing on your own are itching to buy stocks here at steep discounts. So pray Orange Dude gets the Yellow dude to suck his mushroom cock on Friday and all will be well.
1886 2018-11-25 17:14:43 During 10-year periods where:

1. value stocks trailed S&P 500 (19% of the time), stocks did very well vs bonds (S&P 500 > 5-YR T-Notes by +7.1%/yr)

2. value stocks outperformed S&P 500 (81% of the time), stocks did far worse vs bonds (S&P 500 > 5-YR T-Notes by +4.5%/yr)
1887 2018-11-25 17:14:40 Actually, gas prices are higher. Stocks are down. The two could be a sign of recession (Google the word, it’s not good). Yes, thanks. President jackass

1893 2018-11-25 17:09:37 Wow  
Are you interested in investing into stocks?
1894 2018-11-25 17:08:42 @Prashantjaju Finally Monday has come....can i short Tata Steel which has just broken 540 & also Vedanta broken 200...! TCS also looks weak now...waiting to break  1800......what do you say of these 3 stocks for monday?
1895 2018-11-25 17:07:04 If you're joining a trading service because a guy shows you a picture of a fancy car you won't be around long #trading #newtrader Don't spend thousands on DVD's and Education #stocks
1896 2018-11-25 17:06:02 “Your letter is as damaging & disgraceful as Chamberlain’s piece of paper..brought back from Munich.”. At least Chaimberlain bought the UK time while we built up our stocks of Spitfires & Hurricanes. You can’t say the equivalent for May, though #Brexit ers seem to inhabit the 30s
1897 2018-11-25 17:05:58 I agree with what you say Mark but each to their own way of tracking I say. If I’m going to look in each day I may as well know how my stocks are performing otherwise what is the point.I couldn’t not . Some have said I’m addicted but I’d claim I’m conscientiously responsible 
1898 2018-11-25 17:05:37 Like houses in 2008 or stocks now, they cause an asset price bubble when too much new credit money chases too few houses or stocks etc. And if banks decide some assets suck (houses in 2009) prices fall (deflation).
1899 2018-11-25 17:04:54 Lol price depression has hit CT hard. Everyone all hostile.
If you care about dollar numbers that much, why are you even in the crypto game? Go make money trading penny stocks or other scams.

Crypto isn't a scam but a lot of people sure are making it look like one!

1900 2018-11-25 17:04:26 I reallllly wanna get into stocks
1901 2018-11-25 17:03:18 Market may view the fact that stocks have fallen a fair amount and fear of further falls have dissipated.
1902 2018-11-25 17:03:02 Over all rolling 10-year periods since 1928:

S&P 500 > 5-yr T-Notes = +5.0%/yr
Value stocks > S&P 500 = +3.3%/yr

In pursuit of returns, why stop with a stock market index?
1903 2018-11-25 17:02:56 Where there’s a history tweet, there’s a Jason Zweig post!

Great article, Jason. I particularly love the Stocks Up / Down illustrations. 

This has inspired me to do another art history thread later today.

1910 2018-11-25 17:00:18 Yup, but the reason why his sup
may not care..only 54% of
Americans own stocks.
1911 2018-11-25 16:59:48 Every TA completely bearish now ! Biggest Trickster Neptune stationery direct today ! Sharp opposite moves in stocks & crude can't be ruled out

1913 2018-11-25 16:59:03 Agreed! The post office is in a good position to provide simple banking and bill pay services to small savers. They don’t need to do loans or stocks etc but can loosen the grip of the payday lenders by charging smaller fees. #USPS
1914 2018-11-25 16:59:00 Deeper and better background checks
Raise minimum age for gun ownership 
Ban Assault weapons 
Ban bump stocks and other similar mods.

Remove the NRA gun lobbyists from politics. 

All simple and you still get to have your pea-shooter.
1915 2018-11-25 16:58:31 Q: What’s been the best way to offset periods where stocks (S&P 500) underperformed bonds (5-YR T-Notes)?

A: Own value stocks.

During all 10-yr periods since 1928 where stocks trailed bonds:

*S&P 500 averaged -3.6%/yr < bonds 

*Value index averaged +3.6%/yr > S&P 500
1916 2018-11-25 16:58:10 The value of my stocks is falling way faster than the oil prices! Thank you president T. Wanna make sure you get credit for everything that you deserve 
1917 2018-11-25 16:57:45 Which are the stocks fulfilling all these criteria.?
1918 2018-11-25 16:56:56 considering stocks are still near all time highs relatively, you are right. buy apple sub 100
1919 2018-11-25 16:55:43 I agree!  Stocks have sucked
under the current leadership.
1920 2018-11-25 16:54:41 He's just hurting from the fact that he's been rekt on biotech stocks this year
1921 2018-11-25 16:54:10 Right now it is possibly also a wise thing to do. The FB stocks are plummeting. Your personal data will probably change hands in the near future in seek of additional revenue.
1922 2018-11-25 16:53:57 Ratings have been at an all time low for a long time(see jinders run)but still their stocks climbed despite poor attendance. It wasn't until their most recent Saudi show their stocks plummeted. Not allowing woman on a show while trying to proclaim they're a progressive brand hurt
1923 2018-11-25 16:53:15 Despite the recent sharp declines in technology stocks and overall stock prices, the S&P 500 is up slightly in 2018 on a total-return basis.
1924 2018-11-25 16:53:07 Why don’t we talk about the cod stocks? You know, how they collapsed 17 years ago. Came back only earlier this year and have collapsed again! We have zero control globally. 30 million people in Canada and a fucktard for a prime minister.
1925 2018-11-25 16:52:14 The oils-energy sector ended last week 7.4% overvalued with the refining & marketing ind 14.6% overvalued. There are 558 stocks in the sector & only 14 are rated BUY, 138 rated sell and 45 rated strong sell according to ValuEngine (sector  rated underweight - 32.8% rated sell)
1926 2018-11-25 16:51:43 The stocks were going up now going down daily by 500-600 points, thanks you Mr President. Your economics graduation looks like was fake or purchased
1927 2018-11-25 16:50:06 And clearly you don't know tech stocks or company disclosure. Continue to invest in Ford.
1928 2018-11-25 16:49:45 Over all 10-year periods since 1928:

Stocks (S&P 500) beat bonds (5-YR T-Notes) 81.4% of the time.

Value stocks (60% large value index/40% small value index) beat the S&P 500 an almost identical 80.9% of the time.

Value stocks beat bonds 94.1% of the time.
1929 2018-11-25 16:49:43 Lets just see if we can even ban bump stocks before we worry about finger guns
1930 2018-11-25 16:48:45 the wall st system is manipulated. ok, you knew that. now when they see what is going down the big players will attack us with market attacks. they can use the msm and large wads of cash to damage stock value. look at who owns stocks.

1931 2018-11-25 16:47:53 The two coldest years she was speaking of were 1525 and 1538, during the "little ice age". Tough times but Wall Street saw peat stocks go through the roof so not all bad!
1932 2018-11-25 16:45:42 I'll choose to short S and P over btc.  Btc trades crazy even when it was on its way up.  But I'll still play some btc, right now I'm mainly in shorts and small bounces for stocks...
1933 2018-11-25 16:44:26 You keep using straw man arguments to feed your hate for #crypto and people can see through your bias. Just because the market is down doesn't mean its dead or doesn't have potential. The stock market is down right now, are stocks dead? Same goes for gold, housing, dot com crash
1934 2018-11-25 16:44:14 Sounds like even strong blue chip stocks could be hurt bad along with all speculative. Holding any stock may not make sense. Gold, commodities and shorts maybe it.
1935 2018-11-25 16:42:59 NAFO is about fish conservation and sustainability of fish stocks, it doesn't cover the UK or Europe or anywhere east of Greenland. And it has nothing at all to do with the WTO, fishing rights in sovereign waters or tariffs. I'm leaving this discussion now...
1936 2018-11-25 16:42:50 In panic after the deaths, the govt announced it will buy all onion stocks at Rs 8/kg. Not knowing what to do with it as there was no storage, the “mountains” began to rot & stink, so it now offered to dump them at Rs 2/ kg. The taxpayer lost Rs 785 crore in this madness #India
1937 2018-11-25 16:41:20 Is there a way to see which stocks are above or below rather than just the number?

1943 2018-11-25 16:36:23 The only thing you should buy “on sale” are stocks
1944 2018-11-25 16:35:57 there is less risk investing in government secured bonds vs buying shares and stocks

1949 2018-11-25 16:33:54 May be they still hope the good old days will return for these stocks!!! They are just looking at the share price and missing the pathetic performance of the companies. We call this "missing the wood for the trees"

2000 2018-11-25 15:56:50 My pay has gotten higher. And I've gotten 3 bonuses in the past year. My retirement is based solely on stocks. It's doing fabulous. Racism started rising when Obama told the African American community that they were targets.
2001 2018-11-25 15:55:16 Hope everyone enjoying this nice weekend 

I will be doing a video later explaining my investment process of VALUE investing (Warren Buffet) versus growth!

2002 2018-11-25 15:54:59 Too many people judge Crypto’s like stocks since Stocks would be halted if the losses even got to -20-25% Lol Crypto’s don’t have anyone to give you protection so that’s why if you buy #Crypto you better remember, “No one is saving your ass from Decentralized coins.”
2003 2018-11-25 15:54:56 Also, not sure he understands the impact on oil stocks this has.
2004 2018-11-25 15:53:38 The weekly (intermediate) Coppock Curve still has a bearish bias for 24 of the 30 DJIA stocks,
2005 2018-11-25 15:53:38 but my stocks are eating it

2007 2018-11-25 15:52:41 I have a great deal of respect for you. You could be right in the end  but it could get delayed while we suffer a major cyclical drop before the Fed slams down the gas pedal again. Dollar and US stocks could rise at same time if rest of world eases more.
2008 2018-11-25 15:52:33 Not “profit seekers” There existence has not been proven. IMO it’s best to have five years cash crypto for incidentals seven for stocks. Or risk getting price fixated. From the beginning one had five 80% drops yet zoom out 100,000 gained. Buying and selling is a losing game. IMO
2009 2018-11-25 15:51:16 Stocks are down, farmers receive welfare, and gas prices still aren’t as low as 2016. But yea, blow your horn
2010 2018-11-25 15:51:08 I live in Wa State,  we have so many great pot stores here.  I started investing in Canadian pot stocks 2yrs ago.  doing very well now.

2012 2018-11-25 15:50:54 i do own, i WISH i DIDN'T...as soon as the market is up I will sell ALL of them asap...it's worse than penny stocks...none of them will make it.

2015 2018-11-25 15:47:27 As long as the market shows weakness @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @1st5d investors will short stocks and invest in fear which create wealth in chaos...a feed back loop that will leave the workers and small investors holding the bag...w nothing...just saying
2016 2018-11-25 15:47:06 The problem is with the common man on the streets. They will breathe smoke from burning garbage, yet stand next to it and discuss politics, stocks, and cricket. They are oblivious to the fact that air pollution is going to kill them and cause gene mutation to their progeny.

2020 2018-11-25 15:45:27 Wife wants to get me a PS4 for Christmas.
Black Friday sells out all PS4s.
Found one on eBay for $249 with Spiderman and Destiny 2. We buy it. Next day we get an email that we are being refunded the amount due to low stocks.
Meanwhile, all PS4s are back to normal price.

2027 2018-11-25 15:43:17 FYI, myriad variables move the stock market

401K is better; markets always pullback & always correct - identify undervalued/overvalued stocks

fundamentals are in place per stellar economic reports so astute investors take advantage of fear to hold steady or invest, not sell

2029 2018-11-25 15:42:52 It's a shocking deal. We hand over £39Bn pounds for nothing. We have no negotiating cards in future trade talks. We are locked into the CU until the EU agrees we can leave. We lose control of fish stocks and Gibralta on threat of EU veto. They have everything they want.

Resign.
2030 2018-11-25 15:42:48 Fyi..I am still not bearish on nifty!!
But yes trade cautiously.
Individual stocks may hamper or upmove so if you dont comfortable on buy side find weak stocks and look for chances there.
2031 2018-11-25 15:42:26 I do not claim to know U supply side imbalances, I don't know about that. The decision is based on charting and a simple premise that in a global bear market energy stocks will not do well.
2032 2018-11-25 15:41:20 Stocks are at the 12 month lows because oil prices are unravelling so precipitously as a result of your reckless attacks,its not the Feds fault. you are also doing  brutal damage to our own domestic oil business,

2036 2018-11-25 15:39:13 Stocks dropped after Democrats won house! @realDonaldTrump told us that and that is exactly what’s occurring. What did Obozo do? Nothing but cheap talk! We are just not buying it!
2037 2018-11-25 15:39:03 Gas prices are up an average 30% when compared to November 2016. Stocks have fallen to a point eating up any gains made over 2018. Cost of living is higher. Middle class and poor got peed on, while 10% got caviar #GOPTaxScam  Thank you, #FearlessLeader

2047 2018-11-25 15:35:17 @WarrenBuffett Thank you for passing on your knowledge of investing. I started investing into Dividend Stocks earlier this year. I hope to reach a point where dividends will cover my family's cost of living. Goal is $320,000 worth of dividend yielding stocks. #EscapeTheRatRace

2052 2018-11-25 15:33:20 Pay is increasing, goods are rising but mostly due to rise in minimum wages. Stocks fluctuate but are at all time highs so why the negative remarks?
2053 2018-11-25 15:32:31 Wait for the "once the Democrats are seated in the House, they will take all your guns, silencers, and bump stocks, so buy now!!!"

2055 2018-11-25 15:30:29 Why aren't the Black Friday sales there on the stock market? Like 50% off the Apple stock or 75% off the Amazon stock or whatever...
#stocks #stockmarket #BlackFriday2018
2056 2018-11-25 15:30:00 Your a true idiot if you haven't been shorting stocks. Even a worm is smart enough to know that what goes up must come down. Sticks are not the economy, they are guesses controlled by those with the most money. When market is way over bought, it corrects.
2057 2018-11-25 15:29:31 Stocks r wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy DownBlack Friday Sales Down
2058 2018-11-25 15:29:14 The more I see western AAA devs/publishers scrambling to keep their stocks level, the more I'm convinced another game crash is looming on the horizon
2059 2018-11-25 15:28:26 Of course, at the beginning of crash, U shares will get hammered 30% or more, but should recover quick and big upside (similar to gold stocks in 2008)
2060 2018-11-25 15:27:13 Lower oil depresses the stock market. Now that stocks are down for the year, will he accept the correlation? Will his base?
2061 2018-11-25 15:26:14 Bring back the stocks the birch and proper punishments  also can teachers have tasers, cos gas grenades and truncheons 
2062 2018-11-25 15:25:29 I have not sold my OIL stocks but I do have a hedge . Short $XLE . If I had kept my Short $USO . I would not have lost in this malaise so far. If oil crashes again so will the market and junk bonds like 2016. I hope it holds up.
2063 2018-11-25 15:24:58 I would agree. I am very selective with the stocks I short and tend to keep short trades on a short leash. I stick to the head and shoulders and L patterns in charts from big winners.
2064 2018-11-25 15:24:38 All I can say to that is the person that lost money clearly invested in the wrong stocks!! You can not go from 16,000 points to over 25,000 and lose money!! You would have to really buy bad failing stock to do so and that would be 100% your fault nobody else!!
2065 2018-11-25 15:24:35 I am afraid of investing no in expensive stocks
2066 2018-11-25 15:24:31 @secondstone dozens of other stocks look like this. Clearly I need to do some extra education about the importance of rising earnings.
2067 2018-11-25 15:23:04 Yeah, stocks fell when Democrats won back the house. Thanks for making it apparent for everyone!
2068 2018-11-25 15:22:56 Exactly. Short memories.  Or is, that selective since it suits them.  The quotas which have to be agreed by all and technology, change to net sizes etc., to which the Scottish fishermen have been at the forefront  have preserved and increased stocks.
2069 2018-11-25 15:22:27 Duh!!!!  Like no one could see that looking at his history. i invested in stocks in high school, i was a gardener, chef, tool and die maker, you name it, I helped my dad do it, he's a jack of all trades, dress maker too, my Mom loved him and only him, she in heaven,  $ is D's God
2070 2018-11-25 15:21:47 Not if you own oil stocks.401k taken a hit.

2072 2018-11-25 15:21:07 It ain’t Stocks fault the club can’t afford for him to play another game. Hope in the next window he can find another club.

2076 2018-11-25 15:19:32 Brah you might want to stop bragging about the tax cut. You probably don’t want to remind people you piled on another 1.5 trillion in debt so that corporations could buyback their stocks. Probably also might want to learn how the fed works.
2077 2018-11-25 15:18:12 I did some Black Friday shopping too... I bought some stocks and put more into my mutual funds! While a lot of people invested in materialism I invested in my financial health! #Blackfridayshopping #investing
2078 2018-11-25 15:16:42 Exactement, et on pourra constater ça au Canada d'ici quelques temps, vu qu'ils viennent de légaliser la consommation de cannabis.

2079 2018-11-25 15:16:30 If unions were smart, they’d take  all those dues and money they collect and buy stocks in the company and thus build capital and reclaim surplus.

2082 2018-11-25 15:13:49 Serious, non-troll question:  Healthcare stocks have > tech stocks for a long, long time, so, to me, Buffett's big tech bets are less interesting than the noticeable absence of any reasonable healthcare bets.  J&J seems OK, but Teva and Davita?  What gives?

2088 2018-11-25 15:12:22 And wasn’t it the tech stocks that tanked the market in the last few weeks?
2089 2018-11-25 15:10:35 Although my preferred holding period is forever, you don't always get what you want. We say buy, hold and monitor closely. It's easier to say goodbye to stocks if you don't view them as old friends.

2091 2018-11-25 15:09:11 I think your tariffs are going to impact prices more than the lower fuel costs. I feel like our economy is still relatively flat, despite all the bragging about growth. Stocks are falling to where they should have been without all the growth hype.

2096 2018-11-25 15:05:05 Yeah well sports betting is mostly a scam, however it isn't really any worse than stocks, crypto, casino gambling, or any other way people try to get rich. In fact I would argue you are more likely to encounter people of good faith in the gambling world than stocks.
2097 2018-11-25 15:03:58 at least stocks are not going down to zero and are not dropping 15% everyday
2098 2018-11-25 15:02:07 is decreasing over time. It is hard to invest in stocks if there is a high likelihood that you will need the money next year. For those with a lot of money it is no problem if the stock market drops next year or in two years. They can usually sit it out and wait.../2
2099 2018-11-25 15:00:34 Can I get money for stocks this Christmas please.
2100 2018-11-25 14:59:59 Did you ever think that the stocks dropping has been caused by the Democrats taking over the house and the knowledge that they overall restrict business? Are you comparing total jobs for Obama’s 8 years to Trump’s 2?
2101 2018-11-25 14:59:47 No mention of oil stocks falling? Stock Market is crashing? All stock profits of 2018 have been lost?! Yeah thanks White House Resident T. Some tax Cut there for the...??? Corporations!
2102 2018-11-25 14:59:30 10/ If suddenly fewer fish can be caught then this isn't a world first. There have been other interruptions, fish prices go up short term, fish stocks tend to get a big boost, within a year or so people figure out a sensible regime. EU has a bad environmental record here

2127 2018-11-25 14:43:29 The ultimate representation of completely delusional market structure and complacency: there are more ETFs than stocks traded #nuts
2128 2018-11-25 14:42:31 Everyone will read it and then as mkt opens tomo they will buy PCJ, Adag stocks! :)
2129 2018-11-25 14:41:12 Dsl mais nous ne communiquons pas sur nos stocks ni sur nos tarifs via les réseaux
2130 2018-11-25 14:41:00 Alhamdulillah rezeki sold out tiga biji ip7plus hari ni. So esok naik Singapore ambil stocks, ada tiga buyers lagi nak iphone X ngan 7plus.
2131 2018-11-25 14:40:57 2/2 Get a copy of Fairhurst's "Law of the EU" About 800 pages of EU directives, page after page concerned with your and my safety, health and protection from power groups only interested in money and much about protection of our planet, fish stocks, food etc
2132 2018-11-25 14:40:34 Je commence à tomber malade : je n'ai ni rhum, ni thym, ni miel. Je suis en train de boire du citron chaud avec du sucre.
Vivement demainnque je puisse refaire des stocks.

2134 2018-11-25 14:36:33 Who is President T? You mean YOU? YOU'RE THANKING YOURSELF? It's been higher than it was during Obama your entire term! Any savings habe already been lost, and stocks lower than when you took office. Yeah, thanks a lot. Genius. 
If you resign, i will thank you.

Gudnyt peeps!
2137 2018-11-25 14:34:34 In the industrial revolution America used industry to prop its self upon. In a capitalist era you should use capitalistic means...stocks, bonds, etc. now the problem with legal avenues is the reward isn’t nearly as high as your current black ops which you never get revenue from.
2138 2018-11-25 14:34:31 How can I buy Ripple stocks? I can pay for them with my #xrp
2139 2018-11-25 14:33:54 Stocks are dropping rapidly, too. Why have you not taken credit for that?
2140 2018-11-25 14:31:23 You do know stocks are down, the climate is tanking, and you lost the house, right?
2141 2018-11-25 14:30:49 Denominated in Bitcoin, my E&P stocks are doing an amazing job!
2142 2018-11-25 14:30:09 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
2143 2018-11-25 14:29:20 The perfect example of insecurity,  constantly telling others how great you think you are.  However:

My so called tax cut with my miniscule pay increase didn't come close to covering my health insurance increase.  Not to mention cost of living increase and my stocks crashing.
2144 2018-11-25 14:29:07 I love trump how he interferes  with the fed .. but trump most of the stocks downside are because of your trade war .. are you willing to back down ? If you did ill throw my maga hat .. destroy the wto the den of corruption
2145 2018-11-25 14:27:46 Nothing to do with the US, focus on that massive US debt and tanking stocks. World cannot prop up the US bubble forever.
2146 2018-11-25 14:27:46 I meant to ask - how to arrive at significations for different stocks/industries etc. And also to find intra day movements. Based upon Hora?
2147 2018-11-25 14:27:11 @PeterLBrandt looking the charts stocks and Bitcoin, I see end of bull run and end of bear market, can we expect all time high for Bitcoin when crisis will be the strongest.
Banks and funds offers Bitcoin as a new asset around 2020-2022.
2148 2018-11-25 14:26:11 You keep you hands off my vagina and I'll keep my hands off your stupid guns.  frightened little children with big bad weapons threatening EVERYONE.   disgusting indulgence of evil you are for pushing AUTOMATIC WEAPONS! I have guns too - very different than ones with bomb stocks!
2149 2018-11-25 14:25:41 Great diversion to a different topic, but stocks are a long term game. We are down right now but up SIGNIFICANTLY since trumps election. So are you giving him credit for overall increase?
2150 2018-11-25 14:23:55 Copper and Oil down, rates up, stocks flat to topping, and this guy thinks those are positives.

Talk about the "Death of Expertise".
2151 2018-11-25 14:23:37 The internet boom was the last time there was a "tulip craze," when ppl didn't give a sh@t abt what they were investing in, they just wanted in. Asset prices ballooned. Yes, tulips & net stocks, or even crypto are "apples and oranges." It's the price movement that's similar.
2152 2018-11-25 14:23:30 David, I guess you are not invested? It is all a small percentage and my stocks all still have profits. I bought oil when it was very low and cannot wait to invest more $$ in the market.

2154 2018-11-25 14:23:10 It is the best performing asset over the last 10 years. Dwarfed the S&P, DOW, NASDAQ, bonds, currencies and commodities.

Public equities have a bleaker outlook for next decade than BTC. Hopefully you aren’t advising people to put more than 5% of their assets in stocks 
2155 2018-11-25 14:22:35 Nearly any company will accept such exploitation and destruction of it makes stocks go up a point. Then there’s what Exxon did...
2156 2018-11-25 14:22:08 That applies to stocks to gold. That isn't a ponsi. There is no dividend, no recruits required, and no centralized body. It is missing all the conditions to be a ponzi.
2157 2018-11-25 14:21:48 How are those tariffs and the Stock Market?
Where is November's tax break?
Do we all get new coal jobs?
Ford lay offs?
Farmers suffering!
Honorable & humble to thank yourself...what a narcissistic pig.
How are Rake stocks doing?
2158 2018-11-25 14:19:07 How’s that stock market doing? I spend more money on stocks and funds than on gas. No progress in ONE YEAR! Never happened with Obama’s
2159 2018-11-25 14:18:10 My stocks have tanked.
2160 2018-11-25 14:17:04 Isn’t that like saying that if an ETF for the “FAANG” stocks (down what, 1 trillion $$) was introduced, that sentiment would immediately change to positive- why?
2161 2018-11-25 14:16:09 Hun? You really are out of touch, have you seen the market lately??? Stocks down, but still the rich enjoy the biggest tax cut ever ON THE BACKS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS NOW YOUR CRONIES WANT TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TO OFF SET YOU BIGGEST BLUNDER EVER
2162 2018-11-25 14:16:05 Sugar stocks to go up tomorrow...going to buy some...thanks for the chini makhano khobor
2163 2018-11-25 14:15:14 Unfortunately mr president everything our iras And stocks made this year has now disappeared
2164 2018-11-25 14:14:48 But it’s doesn’t deliver till 2022 when the Eu will use the deal to keep us in the CU. What’s the betting the price of staying in the CU is freedom of movement, our fishing stocks and vast sums of money. May has delivered nothing #leavemeansleave can’t trust the tories
2165 2018-11-25 14:14:33 Sir, charging 4500 is a rip off. You are in business of selling expensive eduction and buying cheap stocks
2166 2018-11-25 14:13:42 I've always figured crypto was like any other investment, one isn't likely to become wealthy over night...this even applies to both real estate and stocks. Patience and research are key.
2167 2018-11-25 14:13:35 stocks rise by 1%.
2168 2018-11-25 14:13:29 In terms of brexit - pound drops stocks rise ?? I’m curious and looking to diversify
2169 2018-11-25 14:11:18 I abhor Don the Con and own stocks. They are not mutually exclusive.
2170 2018-11-25 14:10:04 Corporations told us in social media, the financial media, and any news channels,  NOT Fox that they were giving it to their investors. CEO'S answer to their board and other investors.  They , of course,  buy more stocks to make more money. No jobs created.
2171 2018-11-25 14:08:37 Where is the tax cut you announced just before the midterm elections? 
Also what happened to banning bump stocks and raising age to 21 to purchase a firearm?
2172 2018-11-25 14:08:09 Well with stocks falling he has to take credit for over supplying the oil markets I guess.
2173 2018-11-25 14:07:35 The message seems to be getting lost due to focusing on the messenger.  Yes, wages have been stagnant for years.  Minimum wage needs to increase.  That tax cut for the wealthy was a trick, not a trickle.  Businesses are using it to buy back their own stocks.  There's truth.
2174 2018-11-25 14:06:46 Yes I’m eating stocks pound cake for breakfast. No I’m not ashamed about it.
2175 2018-11-25 14:06:20 Companies only care about how much money they make. If it affects their money or stocks they will care if it doesn’t they won’t bat an eye.
2176 2018-11-25 14:06:16 I think you'll find you're wrong about Macron. But as to fishermen & their industry: no such thing as British fish, & fishermen are massively overrepresented. Fishing everywhere needs to be drastically reduced to allow stocks to regenerate, or they'll all be obsolete soon anyway.
2177 2018-11-25 14:06:07 Looking for Nutramigen. Diin nga Pharmacy sa Iloilo ang may stocks? 
2178 2018-11-25 14:05:17 oooh meron din pala sa rob manila, went there earlier. si wonu lang out of stocks
2179 2018-11-25 14:05:09 Be quick, the stocks are short!
2180 2018-11-25 14:04:26 luhhh kasi i asked @ rob manila kanina, last stocks na din daw nila di na daw magrerestock .sad
2181 2018-11-25 14:04:12 Henry, Genuine question, does this “deal” take us out of THE customs union & single market completely or is there another CU hiding in the wording & does the fisheries deal still allow the French trawlers to pillage our stocks or is it the usual smoke & mirrors from the Maybot ?
2182 2018-11-25 14:03:52 Sa maaan 2pm?  Noon daw mag arrive bagong stocks na mabilis naubos nung VIP days/first 2 days.
2183 2018-11-25 14:03:30 No big tax cut for most of us, stocks down, gas still higher than under Obama. So no Mr. T no thanks.
2184 2018-11-25 14:02:16 Stocks are down and inflation is up. You had nothing to do with the price of oil.
2185 2018-11-25 14:02:12 lauramitchem1 Hi Laura, the offer is valid whilst stocks last. Love, PANDORA
2186 2018-11-25 14:02:00 my stocks are way down!!! WHAT YOU DOIN ABOUT THAT?
2187 2018-11-25 14:01:53 i like how the web only allow supplier to send out stocks within 24 hours or else they will be downgraded, I'm loving this
2188 2018-11-25 14:01:12 Tanzania crisis helps Indian traders to sell their RCN stocks in india
2189 2018-11-25 14:00:59 Wrong Mr. President. The danger is falling oil price will depress the world economy & lead to global recession. Oil, banking, and 401K stocks will go south. Jobs will be lost and the effect of climate change will worsen. This price fixing in lieu of holding MBS accountable is sad
2190 2018-11-25 14:00:50 All financial stocks going to burst in 2019
2191 2018-11-25 14:00:47 Now you are President T? Stocks are down for the year?
2192 2018-11-25 14:00:25 Hey there, sorry about the subs, I can see why you're frustrated! If you would let me know your order number I can find out the store and pass this feedback onto them, or give them a call and see why the stocks were low/sold out. Let me know, Rachel
2193 2018-11-25 14:00:21 What has he delivered.  Please tell me.  My health care is ridiculous.  I have had 0 tax cuts. Stocks are in the toilet.  Open your eyes.
2194 2018-11-25 14:00:02 Dalal Street:  RIL may lead the market up over the next 3 to 4 weeks in a technical rally.  But it is unlikely to sustain even though we may very sharp bear rallies in a few stocks.
2195 2018-11-25 13:59:52 Hi Laura, the offer is valid whilst stocks last. Love, PANDORA
2196 2018-11-25 13:58:53 Not to my knowledge , Iceland has never being in the EU and it was its Exclusion Zone that hit Hull’s deep sea fleet from memory . As regards EU fishing quotas , all set up to preserve fish stocks and also U.K. fisherman can fish in non-U.K. waters . These things a 2 way street
2197 2018-11-25 13:58:50 Mis datos es lo que vivo a diario, los Stocks, Inversiones, construcciones, empleos, 401k, ventas... Eso es COLECTIVO.. No a dudas que Trump pasara a la historia como los MEJORES.. Ya tu Obama quedó como el PEOR ganándole a Carter 
2198 2018-11-25 13:57:52 Aujourd'hui journée en or. J'ai l'estomac et le coeur remplie!

2199 2018-11-25 13:56:48 This world if full demons, stocks and bible traitors.
2200 2018-11-25 13:56:44 Avoid illiquid stocks to trade till election 2019. As chances of getting trap are more there.
2201 2018-11-25 13:56:39 Next up.  Money For Nothing. Thanks to Dire Straits. Think about it. Even though this song is from the '80s it STILL might tell you something. Money For Nothing - Dire Straits. MTV all over again. Stocks CAN go down. Think about it.. you decide your fate.
2202 2018-11-25 13:56:20 Stock markets go up and down benefits the super rich and multinational companies with their massive investment buying shares & stocks LOW selling em high.
 People make a living from stocks falling & going high ITS a roulette table for them
2203 2018-11-25 13:56:05 What about the stocks, health care,gun control.  Not to mention you lying to everyone
2204 2018-11-25 13:55:34 What part of “you don’t need an assault grade weapon to protect yourself” and “ar 15’s with bump stocks are not in the constitution” don’t you get? #stupid
2205 2018-11-25 13:54:51 Pour manger #écologique la 1ère règle est d’éviter le #gaspillage : avant de faire les courses penser à établir des menus ET UNE LISTE DE COURSES (permet de consommer en priorité les stocks, évite/limite les achats compulsifs...)

2206 2018-11-25 13:54:04 Taking profit. Tech and oil stocks have been the safe bet for 8 years. Money is about to move into corporate bonds and mfg stocks for expansion. Stock buy-backs give equity to corps for bonds.
2207 2018-11-25 13:52:56 Q tell you there'd be a "red wave" and "liberal riot mobs" .. what else?
McCain secretly tried and executed in shadow courts?
Jeff Sessions gonna somethin somethin.. Q-prophecies gone wrong?  What other Qultic prophecies of Trump grandeur you got?  Q tell you stocks would drop?
2208 2018-11-25 13:51:53 Moron, inflation is rising, the economy is slowing and stocks have lose all it's gains this year. Plus you have made deep cuts to the VA and many vets have not received their GI bill. You suck as a human being. You can't run a country like you did you failed businesses.
2209 2018-11-25 13:51:33 Hahahah. Good response. It's a huge clusterfuck. Once again, the Tory party are going to fuck it up. Self interested wankers. Davies, Johnson, rees mogg etc should be publicly put in stocks and have fruit throw at them.
2210 2018-11-25 13:51:30 Because the Left gave credit to Obama so why mention it. PS IM WAY UP you puck lousy stocks Butt Head Brian

2214 2018-11-25 13:47:25 I've been reading that Dylan Jones book. Have you read it? I learned a bit about the later period, mostly about stocks and bonds. It's a book to dip into rather than read chronologically. Not massively insightful about the music I'm finding.
2215 2018-11-25 13:46:37 hOY SO GANITO JAJSJAJAJA sabi q sa parents q may stocks pa ng seungcheol sa ibang branch and sabi ko parang gusto kong bumili and,,,, hINDI SILA KUMONTRA????? omg seungcheol see u?????

2224 2018-11-25 13:38:50 this is the main reason the stocks are tumbling on wall street, can you even imagine this ditzy woman having ANYTHING to do with wall street finances??
2225 2018-11-25 13:37:53 The Egypt stockmarket index, the EGX30, fell 3.8%, with CIB shares off 6.5%, pushed lower by the proposed tax law on banks. Other stocks to fall included Sidi Krier Petrochemicals, off 5.8% and Qalaa Holdings, off 5.1%.
2226 2018-11-25 13:37:41 UK is running out of warehouse space. Also, to stockpile chemicals assumes producers have large stocks to sell.
2227 2018-11-25 13:36:21 Hi There, we do have promotional cards available while stocks last so grab one quick! Looking forward to it?
2228 2018-11-25 13:36:05 I can only buy one box of sudafed but I can buy10K rounds of .223, that makes no since what so ever. No one needs that much ameo an if that do they should have to tell someone why, no one needs bump stocks, no one needs hundred round clips, I could go on, but you get the point.
2229 2018-11-25 13:34:55 Thanks Andrew.
Have recently read “Common Stocks and uncommon profits” and “Competition Demystified”
Will take a look at the others.
2230 2018-11-25 13:32:06 Im curious, exactly how much extra revenue do we expect fishermen to contribute to the exchequer when we fish in our own coastal waters?You know, when we can’t fish off the coast of EU countries? And when those stocks are delegated or when those pesky fish have swum to EU waters?
2231 2018-11-25 13:31:36 when i find one i'll make sure to tell you  bighit's official site still don't have stocks for ver 3 sadly

2234 2018-11-25 13:31:02 Don't be disheartened, Yash! Discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. Nonetheless, we offer great deals and discounts quite occasionally. So do keep an eye out for them! ^SU
2235 2018-11-25 13:30:03 Sir, P/B ratio without ROE does not make much sense in my opinion.
Investors should look for bargain in individual stocks instead of researching valuation of NIFTY as a whole.
2236 2018-11-25 13:28:55 Get a slow cooker if you don’t have one. Stews, stocks, chilli, curry, soups, start in the morning, leave all day and its ready when you come back.

2245 2018-11-25 13:22:14 Not buying any #stocks, looking at accumulating more #cryptocurrencies with #xrp in the lead. My real concern is #realestate as that area is major to me. If market drops, my eyes are on #southbeach, #miami to acquire =i
2246 2018-11-25 13:21:55 i should go and make my priorities right. i'm missing out by not reading Janus Silang and am hating myself

2260 2018-11-25 13:03:53 Sick of people saying that they 'condemn the action' of so-and-so. The law isn't half hard or fearsome enough now. Nothing to deter vermin from carrying out these atrocious crimes. Whatever was wrong with putting those who deserve it in the man cage or stocks?
2261 2018-11-25 13:02:57 We need to force Democrats to buy more stocks so that the market keeps going up. They're trying to hurt MAGA with their wallets.
2262 2018-11-25 13:01:34 What is the attraction of JD headers?? Apart from the dealer being nearby, which apparently stocks nothing anyway, and the “fantastic greenstar” do they actually do a good job as everyone I talk to starts with “yeah well”

2265 2018-11-25 12:56:28 I wonder if Trump knows the history of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.  Stock market investors became aware in autumn of 1929 that the bill would pass and that it would damage the economy, so they sold stocks which triggered the crash of 1929.

2270 2018-11-25 12:47:16 All my assets are bleeding atm - stocks, forex, property, crypto.  Like they say no pain - no gain ;-)   One positive is that if crypto survives and you have a 3-5 year view there are some nice buying opportunities around!
2271 2018-11-25 12:47:10 I don't believe gold is a bet. Maybe silver a bit more. US Dollar, Euro, Yen is a bet. Stocks are now bets. Real estate bubble too. Gold is solid, historical, value retention. Everything else in today's speculative world is a bet.

2279 2018-11-25 12:41:59 Accurate but dead wrong in terms of smart trading. Selling stocks in good and profitable companies because a crypto currency is crashing is poor fundamental trading. There’s other reasons that may or may not be legit, but crypto/stocks is a horrible genesis for a trade.
2280 2018-11-25 12:41:37 i am not arrogant. This is only economy knowledge. If you like to play diota you pay anyway even if you have an ethnic or other conflict in this case. How many people cry about stocks and buy stocks anyway?? Maybe ask Apple :D this is human nature
2281 2018-11-25 12:41:27 that is so fucking true actually. you should have considered carats who are planning to buy those svt perfumes. there's no need to flaunt that you have the money to buy all the stocks. #lrt

2312 2018-11-25 12:02:28 Yes, overall a short squeeze combined with a macro factor. Although in #crypto I do think the factor has to be more specific to the sector. I always think back to the 2009 and what sparked that recovery in credit/stocks.... TARP/PPIP.
2313 2018-11-25 12:01:58 An "exit" that leaves the UK tied to EU customs arrangements, EU future trade arrangements with third parties, EU taxation law, access for EU states to British fish stocks, and still subject to the ECJ, is no exit at all.

2358 2018-11-25 11:17:26 Understand that, but I'm asking where in history did stocks get quoted with the inverse relationship to earnings that pretty much all other asset classes did. I just think it would be so much more simple if everyone just quoted yield. 3% vs 6% easier than 3% vs 16.66 PE ratio.

2374 2018-11-25 11:03:18 I actually got Mario Odyssey a week early thanks to this really shady store hidden in my town. Everyone goes crazy over the store, it stocks stuff way to early.
2375 2018-11-25 11:01:36 Ateeee ilang stocks na po yung nakuha??
2376 2018-11-25 11:01:20 bakit di nyo pa inubos stocks ng perfume sa uptc ha HA ???
2377 2018-11-25 10:56:38 Jim Cramer tells people to buy and sell stocks he is wrong sometimes some people might say more than sometimes  nobody arrested him 
2378 2018-11-25 10:55:33 Tout à fait d accord. Il faut voir tout de même dans une quinzaine de jour car la baisse ne peut être repercuté sur des achats deja effectués.  Seul l'achat des nouveaux stocks sera impacté par la baisse.
2379 2018-11-25 10:52:17 we are at a more complicated stage now ,most know a market does not always reflect true value, it is sentiment driven, sentiment is now low, no major reason for a correction as I see it, continued slow drift in2 negative sentiment, quality will prevail avoid non revenue stocks
2380 2018-11-25 10:50:06 Interesting events unfolding in regards to the UK decision to leave the UK. In other news FAANG stocks still taking a beating. Now is the time to buy
2381 2018-11-25 10:48:34 It’s not about that. First you wouldn’t believe how few traders really backtest and build strategies. 1 strategy involves finding the idea, stocks, backtest on min 300-500 stocks. But the real reason people fail is the mental aspect and not being able to respect their edge.
2382 2018-11-25 10:48:29 Ça fait une belle diversion tout ça pour remplir les stocks de came avant les fêtes. L'attention des forces de l'ordre est monopolisée, c'est pas le jeu des cités de s'allier à qui que ce soit dans le chao, le business doit tourner en paix... mais les appariteurs de police? Fini?
2383 2018-11-25 10:48:17 Fraudster, accused, chargesheeted, jailed and people supporting all these, are sensible persons? Hmm, so that's what the mastermind mentor has sermoned to stooges & people bought over by him & then they became ''sensible"! Now, sensible don't answer how 6K crore stocks vanished.

2416 2018-11-25 09:51:55 Of course some Train and Equip, Div30 etc weapons got diverted.

But again, that was failure on behalf of the Pentagon/CIA etc not policy to supply ISIS. But also, the massive massive majority of ISIS arms are from looted Assadi and Iraqi arms stocks, mostly the former afaik.

Pathetic.
2453 2018-11-25 09:04:41 The reporting standards for publicly listed tech companies is insufficient for fully informed decision making. There is little ability to understand if stock prices are hype driven or real. It takes a lot of time to reach a like for like comparison of stocks.
2454 2018-11-25 09:04:38 This feels so wrong. 'Policies that haven't worked in our interests'? I suppose our farmers will do just fine when they lose their subsidies and face vast imports of US hormonal beef? And our fishermen will be free again to devastate our fish stocks?

2497 2018-11-25 07:51:26 OBSERVATIONS:

VEDL  are likely to show some weakness. There is decrease in its open interest with falling prices. – Weak Signal

Long Buildup was seen in all OMCs i.e. showing Positivity in stocks.
2498 2018-11-25 07:47:34  is this the bottom? Probably not. Could we see $1900? No one knows- maybe if stocks completely melt down too. But DCAing was the way to go 2013-2017. There will be bounces 
2499 2018-11-25 07:44:31 All because they are too lazy to learn stocks.
2500 2018-11-25 07:39:44 Bawal ba i-withdraw yung nasa stocks? Bakit sya lagi nangungutang??? 
2501 2018-11-25 07:38:56 
2502 2018-11-25 07:37:46 Bump stocks are range toys, but they are a workaround to get past the *unconstitutional* NFA. 
Youwant to go after so-called "assault rifles", but fists, knives and hammers and feet have each been used to kill more people than ALL rifles combined, buch less the ones that scare u
2503 2018-11-25 07:37:31 I bet you many in the inner cir le made Rmillions trading stocks then
2504 2018-11-25 07:37:22 Lol.. so if an account is opened in 2016/2017 then it's BJP IT cell.? Wow logic.. mere tweets and likes bhi check kar lo.. kaafi sports and stocks pe bhi milenge.. ab ye mat bolna ki BJP IT cell stock market mein daalne ke liye paise deta hai 
2505 2018-11-25 07:36:05 BTC is money...FIAT is money...gold and silver is money..realestate and stocks are money too..you should have all of them..I do..I am happy with my choice.  Down market don't bother me..time to buy on fear...
2506 2018-11-25 07:34:17 Some people become Investor( trader to Investor) , if stocks prices are down from their Trading prices(Buy Prices).
2507 2018-11-25 07:33:52 I understand what a hedge is and how it works. I hedge my positions in stocks and shares, currency and crypto using IG. I can promise you I am not stupid little man. What you basically said was that when crypto fell and XRP was flat, people bought XRP and they are gonna sell now.
2508 2018-11-25 07:32:22 Those are the only reasons?

Giving away our fishing stocks.
Gibraltar
The unnecessary backstop
The £40bn
Handing over the choice as to when we leave to Brussels

It's a sell out!

I am totally behind your decision not to support this deal!

Oh, & don't back the UN pact either!
2509 2018-11-25 07:29:58 @zerodhaonline Can you please help in understanding what is MIS, CNC and other options in buying and selling the stocks on zerodha?
2510 2018-11-25 07:29:19 When US market is booming for last few years , no wonder FII participation has been less & less. Moreover Chinese stocks are at cheaper valuations now. But if market trend changes in US, FIIs could come back again
2511 2018-11-25 07:26:18 TBH the volatility in crypto is pure exhilaration. I’m sure I won’t be getting this kinda momentum in stocks. Hard for me to return to the equities market.
2512 2018-11-25 07:26:09 ان شاء الله ، سيتم ايصال طلبك الى القسم المختص ، تكرم عيونك
2513 2018-11-25 07:23:07 (1/2) Global sentiment: Global cues may remain the most dominant factor that will steer market mood next week. Investors across global markets will closely observe how tech stocks fare on Wall Street as the sector has been among the most important indicators
2514 2018-11-25 07:23:05 i think im a medium too. but only the large sizes are available for this colour ughh i wonder when will @jamescharles drop the new stocks
2515 2018-11-25 07:21:39 Does that mean you believe everything your told? What if you claimed I was the CEO of Goldman Sachs and diluted my own stocks & called it "goldmansv"...and said it's the real stock ticket. Come buy some!!! What u waiting for?
2516 2018-11-25 07:21:38 Probably not wise to celebrate the big drops in #cryptocurrency #bitcoin by the mass media death wishers, since it seems down #cryptos also pull #stocks negatively to the downside.

2520 2018-11-25 07:16:56 Claptrap. Lies. and Rubbish. You are denying BRITISH people, notably the youth, the opportunities free movement offers. EU policies have revitalised the fish stocks. We have a weak negotiating position going forward and Gibraltar has been thrown under the bus. Revoke A50.
2521 2018-11-25 07:16:01 Its kinda perfect tho...

BTC bottoming before stocks crash... 

perfect refuge
2522 2018-11-25 07:14:57 I never saw it before.  in srilanka last test in action,  stocks claimed by shandken twice in morning n it was no ball on both ossasions
2523 2018-11-25 07:14:36 But they didn’t use it as a hedge, XRP sat flat when all other coins dropped. There hasn’t been an opportunity for greed yet either. I’m still massively long. Especially through December into January. Plus a recession is coming next year so Crypto will be big. Out of stocks into?
2524 2018-11-25 07:13:29 @C0SMICLATTEPH May update na ba supplier nyo sa abv3? Ilang buwan na oh, yung ibang supplier, may mga extra stocks na na ibinibigay. Yung sa inyo, kahit partial, wala? Sagot naman mga gurly.
2525 2018-11-25 07:12:42 How can anybody buy their stocks,jeez. It's overvalued $SSTI #fraud
2526 2018-11-25 07:12:31 Don’t know squat about crypto (own little) but as far as stocks- when theyve been parabolic, they lack the consolidation levels that can form supports during selloffs. Good luck to you all!

2529 2018-11-25 07:07:16 Like 1929 all 9ver again. 40% of all money loaned out then used to by stocks on the exchange. But at this time farmers were going broke low prices after WWI,  but most important in the 1920s stagnant wages for over 10 years. Go to You Tube. BBC The Great Depression
2530 2018-11-25 07:04:32 Look forward to hearing which of your stocks you present at Stockopedia’s stockslam.
2531 2018-11-25 07:03:55 Price has no co relation. By that logic most of stocks are at lows including many that are india's leading cos in their sectors. Including some Mnc cos.
2532 2018-11-25 07:03:14 So I'm guessing there's some bullshit copyright reason as to why there hasn't been a rising indie company focused on making affordable insulin to compete with these pharma corps putting their stocks over people's lives?
2533 2018-11-25 07:00:51 Gusto ko yung may pakalkal factor! hahahahaha pero sabi rin ng friend ko wala na rin dk sa galle. super limited na ng stocks ng mga mababangong member.

2538 2018-11-25 06:55:59 Apple, the stock that’s in about everyone’s 401k has taken a huge hit. Ask your brother about this. My stocks are pretty conservatively distributed,  any money that I made over the past 20+ months is gone. Health insurance? GOP/trump have made a colossal mess. We pay that price.

2540 2018-11-25 06:48:43 Pag may extra stocks sa store na binibilhan ko ng vivace pag dumating dito sa pinas, I'm gonna buy. Pero for now, sa repack ang focus ko. I just got my albums this week, ano ba 
2541 2018-11-25 06:48:36 I licked   the sad stocks !!
2542 2018-11-25 06:48:30 The Dr Moodys and Professor Stocks of this world would be the first to complain if it were socially acceptable to target people for harassment because of sexual orientation or race. Yet, both appear to believe that such conduct towards #transgender people is 'academic freedom' 1
2543 2018-11-25 06:46:24 And napag alaman ko na may mga stocks pa ng eribong sa mga shops

2546 2018-11-25 06:39:17 I don’t day trade #crypto and #stocks. In it for the tech, companies, and long term potential growth. 
2547 2018-11-25 06:39:05 damn i really had a dream about stocks LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2548 2018-11-25 06:38:48 Its the same as any other rifle.
It takes the same caliber as many other rifle, has the same fire rate. The only difference that makes it more popular is that its more customizable in the sense of changing out parts like skeletonized triggers, ported barrels, stocks, etc.

2556 2018-11-25 06:24:46 Think you should currently  be focusing on the mid cap, small cap and penny stocks in your portfolio and leave bitcoin for the Chinese to evaluate
2557 2018-11-25 06:24:05 But they have a lot of liquid money too. Let's get real here. The mansions aren't bought by giving away their stocks. The super yach salesman doesn't take Facebook stock he only wants greenbacks or a credit card nowadays
2558 2018-11-25 06:22:58 These folks said stocks bonds and investments don’t matter I hate yall ppl
2559 2018-11-25 06:20:03 Walmart value is more than Gucci in stocks.  Plus BTS are millionaires so yeah your depiction is correct.
2560 2018-11-25 06:18:07 folk stocks
2561 2018-11-25 06:15:52 worth really understanding ! .. BOSCH and SKF .. do they need such actions to spell confidence in their stocks ... Tata Investment would do well to clear Debt in other Group Companies ...their must be some agenda .. seriously questioning !
2562 2018-11-25 06:14:04 DAYBREAK CIRCLE stocks rallying
2563 2018-11-25 06:13:07 And I need a style that will last for at least a month! I see why my cousin stocks up on wigs when she isn’t offshore 
2564 2018-11-25 06:12:53 And that is how Mt gox happened. They couldn’t cover the withdrawals. A bank run can happen anytime. Remember how custody works. Not like stocks. You can withdraw btc. And they can’t lend out what they don’t have. That’s fractional reserves.
2565 2018-11-25 06:10:44 I hope so, its much needed. I dont invest in stocks because all valuations are an absurd joke.
2566 2018-11-25 06:01:09 Malapit na December parating na supplies doon sa sleeves haven na pinuntahan natin, and they will have their new stocks of their binders too.

2570 2018-11-25 05:53:54 Companies doing Buybacks ... to ensure stocks don't fall further ? ... most of these Buybacks are when the promoter fears fall in prices that may affect their Collateral Value, so better to Invest surplus in own stocks .. like TCS and even L&T recently ... ! .. opinions welcomed!
2571 2018-11-25 05:53:47 Two stocks in my list can become trade for next week and so on.  ABFRL and GMMPFAUDLER.  Both showing string VCP characteristics. Last week trade FILATEX is ON.
2572 2018-11-25 05:51:18 I’m just stomaching this downturn and will be buying more. Apple is still one of the best stocks in the market
2573 2018-11-25 05:51:02 More important mate, very few still convinced about possible gold bull run and so very few invested meaningfully in gold stocks.
Most gold bugs have given up on this now as you know.
2574 2018-11-25 05:48:14 Let’s pray there will still be stocks on Wednesday bc that’s probably the only day I can go 
2575 2018-11-25 05:42:54 the flattery watching my stocks increase
2576 2018-11-25 05:41:32 Compare the current situation of the virtual currency market with the situation of technology stocks during the Internet bubble in 2000 and the subsequent burst of the Internet bubble. Amazon's share price has fallen sharply after the Internet bubble burst.
2577 2018-11-25 05:36:05 Parabolic moves in penny stocks (which trade similarly to brypto) sometimes repeat themselves to a lesser extent randomly over years after getting pumped by promos, other times they just get delisted & disappear forever. Caveat emptor.
2578 2018-11-25 05:35:48 The world is looking heavy in crude the next 12 months while growth slows. US stocks had to follow ROW eventually. US Gov’t needs a lot of $ and risk parity guys aren’t positioned well for this divergence. Biggest surprise to me was the speed of oil’s drop.
2579 2018-11-25 05:28:47 ASX200 after a wave 2 corrective rise which should start now , should have the major wave 3 down early 2019,
No way RIO/BHP can escape the carnage.

Only question for me  is how PM stocks will behave ?
2580 2018-11-25 05:25:44 And why the stocks seem to be tanking...they are losing money and can’t support their money  laundering scheme.
2581 2018-11-25 05:23:34 @gvkreddi @unseenvalue any views of cpse etf ffo3?
All psu companies, primarily energys, no doubt Govt. effort to raise money, but I was thinking of the 4.5% upfront discount.
worthwhile to purchase and sell on listing for easy money?
Besides, massive correction in these stocks
2582 2018-11-25 05:22:53 I'd just like to ask what's your job dude, you do stocks?
2583 2018-11-25 05:22:10 Interesting as cryptos seem to have lead corrections in the stock market this year if what’s been happening in cryptos in the last week is any indication then there will be continued downside in stocks ahead.
2584 2018-11-25 05:22:09 1. No such thing as an assault weapon. 2. Automatic weapons are already highly controlled. 3. Bump stocks are already illegal.
2585 2018-11-25 05:19:34 We are in an interesting time in the world  unlike “ever” before; Artificial intelligence is not that far away when a robot can be programmed to have what seems like human consciousness. Is stocks, crypto, fiat, etc really necessary in this new world... 
2586 2018-11-25 05:19:34 You are wrong. Gambler always have less chance of loosing. They always bet on calculation. Idc about index I focus on my stocks. Index can give me daily feed but stock will buy bungalow for me. 9 out of 10 TL have bearish view. Markets usually go opposite of obvious.
2587 2018-11-25 05:19:16 the effect might be very, very small, but it does seem biased in direction of exaggerating what it means that "50% in 100k-200k bracket own no stocks"
2588 2018-11-25 05:19:13 Well, the modifications I read referring to aren't of the mechanical variety necessarily so much as peripheral components. Like hand guards, charging handles, stocks, muzzle brakes etc.
2589 2018-11-25 05:18:43 In addition plenty of crypto coins pay daily, weekly or monthly dividends in real time.  Unlike traditional stocks where I am paid quarterly.
2590 2018-11-25 05:18:31 unfortunately as you have observed they R not doing their job I hv been following your analysis on banking stocks & whatevr U have told has come out to be true. May your tribe grow.
2591 2018-11-25 05:18:21 will reply in video published today/tomorrow
2592 2018-11-25 05:17:53 Best time to buy psu stocks is when the government is doing a buyback
2593 2018-11-25 05:16:17 Weekly review

Clients have added 67K long Index CE and 17K long Stocks Future contracts this week.
2594 2018-11-25 05:15:55 Weekly review

FIIs have added 9K long Index Futures, 10K short Index CE, net 18K long Index PE and 15K short Stocks Futures contracts this week. They have also been net sellers in equity segment for ₹856 crore during the week.
2595 2018-11-25 05:14:03 my rough perception, fwiw, is that i'm more aware of people who invest w/o adequate liquid savings, or invest in specific assets (financial, real estate, w/e) before maxing out 401k etc, than people too risk-averse to invest in stocks

would also be helpful to have age-breakdown
2596 2018-11-25 05:14:01 I'm assuming because of the time it takes to ship full stocks worldwide
2597 2018-11-25 05:13:38 apple stocks rise by 10%.
2598 2018-11-25 05:12:42 may be u could re-consider PSU stocks the Govt would offload stake from time to time ..!
2599 2018-11-25 05:10:48 Jessie’s dad stocks me up with food everytime I go over 
2600 2018-11-25 05:10:05 They believe the pyramids were built by stocks and stones.... so anything goes w them...lol.
2601 2018-11-25 05:09:59 Pretty sure stocks are all about money
2602 2018-11-25 05:09:32 was it a multiple day event? :0 maybe it was the last copy of the day but they made an unplanned reprint the next day :^( our group definitely informs buyers if ever fresh copies are coming out the next day or if theyre cool with getting display and showing stocks are out
2603 2018-11-25 05:08:06 Bullcaps para sainyo mga paps  for only 199 php nalang! pm lang sa may mga trip!! limited stocks lang po hehehe
2604 2018-11-25 05:06:57 Le Canada et les producteurs… Stocks Suffers Through More
2605 2018-11-25 05:04:40 IMO pain will continue into whole of 2019 for base/ev/oil/u stocks investors but now we get a 3 wave corrective upward rally in those stocks.
2606 2018-11-25 05:02:27 People are feeling safer with the stocks, old-fashioned Dollar + interest. They don't like the regulatory risk and Crypto flops. The attempts to find a heart beat in Silver market defies belief. 100% wrong. Is that possible? 
2607 2018-11-25 05:02:19 If I can't have that Season's Greetings 2019 then at least let me spend the money for the bts concert. I'M SO SAD RN JUST TAKE MY MONEY 

Why is the SG stocks so limited 
@BigHitEnt @BigHitShop @BTS_twt
2608 2018-11-25 05:00:16 Crude going down is good for India. I mean Indian consumers, Indian economy and Indian guvt 
Yes, it may not be good for Indian equity markets and many (not all but many) stocks.
Sadly analysts abs media don't know to differentiate between these .
2609 2018-11-25 04:57:17 That's not how I approach this. I allocate a fixed amount for this trade and use more of that allocation the lower it drops. I'm interested for the first time this year though. Still have most my focus on mining stocks for Q4 but will wade into $BTC slowly
2610 2018-11-25 04:57:15 No Bitcoin is not a company but it doesn’t mean that FAANG stocks were bad investments in the past decade with the artificial low interest rates. Bitcoin is indeed still very speculative asset but it has value in a world with unresolved debt problem and its not the current price
2611 2018-11-25 04:57:11 Penny stocks 
2612 2018-11-25 04:55:53 Wow, #2018 has been rough. 
So far I've lost:  
Long term relationship 
Grandpa
Business startup 
$10k in #Crypto 
$3.5K car repair 
$1.5k in #stocks 

Eh, I guess that's not that long of a list. 
Definitely limping to the finish line though.
2613 2018-11-25 04:53:42 My people my people . stop playing the "chart game" this is crypto not stocks and FOREX. You will not be pleased with results. Most of the time...
This is not financial advice....:)
2614 2018-11-25 04:52:15 For attn of gold and silver mining stocks investors:
7.5 year Hurst cycle indicates a major multi year high late 2019 and 9.0 year Hurst cycle indicates a major multi year high late 2020/early 2021 ( one of them is )
Starting reference point is 2011 high time frame.
Stay cool.
2615 2018-11-25 04:48:57 You can, have been done in different countries for centuries, they buy stocks, communication acts or government funding. The methods can make it authoritarian or not, but isn't intrinsical authoritarian and it has been done.
2616 2018-11-25 04:48:37 Who is arguing?

My view is that the market will dump on Paterson nearology plays once (if) news of any RIO discovery is announced.

I'm not making any suggestion or entering into any debate about stocks running or not running. 

One is not dependant on the other.

2618 2018-11-25 04:43:50 Fully loaded in gold, silver, diamond and platinum stocks, I have been always a phenomenal risk taker ( after entering the markets in May 2001 and  seeing a 70 % cut in a few weeks in aftermath of 9/11 when I was a rookie investor in India stock  markets )
2619 2018-11-25 04:42:20 I suspect an argument concerning zero movement on bump stocks or high capacity magazines after 422 people were shot in Las Vegas would be valid, as both (like salad) aren't in the constitution.
2620 2018-11-25 04:42:03 They send our Military into needless wars over oil when we should be innovating technology to defeat global warming. Bit coin is not tied to currency or stocks it human lives and disasters. Harp needs to come to a hault
2621 2018-11-25 04:41:31 Pride of the northeast, the mongoloid stocks. May, God bless you Mary Kim.
2622 2018-11-25 04:38:38 Makes no sense though. So many stocks dip and then don't recover. VERY few stocks dip and then perform like Amazon does. You can't base the future of an unrelated price to the historical movement for the price of an unrelated good.
2623 2018-11-25 04:36:56 Or you can buy stocks and lose your money your choice
2624 2018-11-25 04:36:36 Ceat looks attractive.. Rubber prices down a lot.. 
What's your pick? Money is stagnating in these stocks though.. Except balkrishna probably..
2625 2018-11-25 04:34:55 The way stocks are cracking, high time OLX opens a counter for selling used second hand stock.

2630 2018-11-25 04:28:06 Are you being hyperbolic, or are you really trying to stand up the strawman that Trump is accused of destroying soybean stocks 
Because his trade war's effect on the soybean market is very obvious and well-documented.
2631 2018-11-25 04:28:00 If ever you’re still finding for other members, sm aura is just near glo  feeling ko madami pa talaga sila stocks since few lang ang nagvvisit sa shop
2632 2018-11-25 04:25:04 If U are so worried about cost, why does the taxpayer pay so much towards your time in NJ,NY, DC and FL. Why are we paying farmers 4 tariff relief for trade wars that you created? Why are we allowing corps to pump stocks on gains from Tax giveaways only to sell off for profit?
2633 2018-11-25 04:22:46 Ahhhhhhh! I LOVE this power chess called Yuuutsu na asa!!!! I have never been so excited about someone buying stocks!!! 
2634 2018-11-25 04:20:11 This makes me incredibly sad as I used to find WestJet amazing for customer service. No wonder your stocks are down,  your service is way down

2636 2018-11-25 04:18:07 I don't think I will be able to make money in FnO 
FnO is risky and I am tired of it.

Can u pls suggest some stocks at good value to enter for long term.
I will hold for 4 to 5 years
Or for short term also
2637 2018-11-25 04:18:02 Man ... weird how randomn things can trigger ya passions from yesteryear.  

I use to love following, researching, & trading stocks.
2638 2018-11-25 04:17:04 Zip ties are really cheap and you can tie it to the dock plus tie the game cart shut. Makes it more inconvenient to take down. If 3 stocks ends up being too long the game will most likely switch to 2 stock, and I think regular players will learn the stages pretty quickly
2639 2018-11-25 04:13:39 apple stocks rise by 69%.
2640 2018-11-25 04:11:00 If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldn’t be in stocks. --John Bogle
2641 2018-11-25 04:10:18 Wtf are you talking about. Investors have left and are leaving AB & . Housing down 15-20%.And an impending sales tax.I’ll take trumps economy everyday of the week.Lower taxes, jobs, stocks up and OIL & GAS is 4 sale. Give ur head a shake.
2642 2018-11-25 04:10:05 you want NO regs, currently: Limit on amount of amo? Nope. Limit on mag size? Don’t want that.  Limit on number of guns? Nope. Limit on bump stocks? Nope..  compare US to other 1st world countries... we are the odd man out... also more deaths... but freedom has it’s costs no?
2643 2018-11-25 04:05:37 The Industry in Hull was destroyed by the Cod wars,  not the rest of it. 

With most areas of exploiting natural resources the science is better now than in the past. That doesn't mean a system whereby 60% of UK stocks are allocated to foreign boats is acceptable.
2644 2018-11-25 04:02:12 Everything is down..stocks, crypto you name it. I just wonder if there is actually another recession on the way what can crypto anticipate in terms of new investors? Hmm...
2645 2018-11-25 04:00:56 This is the wild wild west just like stocks once was.. only the strong survive . Il be knife catching all the time, and come out to show my scars as a F@&$ warrior. Panic sellers become fomoers. they feed the movement, they feed the greed. hodl are watching.

2647 2018-11-25 03:56:09 It is in the ditto when you kill yourself doing it too when you both have 2 stocks (rockcrock ganoncide or wiz kick)

Otherwise nah
2648 2018-11-25 03:56:06 Basg december guro. Sale man gud sila ba. Ginahurot guro ang stocks bago mag butang.
2649 2018-11-25 03:55:12 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance
2650 2018-11-25 03:55:04 I'm up in Columbus, Ohio visiting some tickle furs and today I broke the latch on a set of foot stocks. Stronk pig is too stronk haha
2651 2018-11-25 03:54:58 It is an early stage tech company and thusly is trading like one. If @Uber was liquid it would be down 30-40% this month like other highly volatile tech stocks.

Bitcoin still has a lot of work to do on basic tech: UX and Security are the biggest limitations but there are others.
2652 2018-11-25 03:54:32 Last adto ko wala pa. old stocks palang ehh.
2653 2018-11-25 03:49:35 I don't think so, many North American investors are fully into O&G stocks as a diversification from FAANG, this will end badly for them IMHO. Just check out Seeking Alpha articles on how bullish the investors were till recently.
2654 2018-11-25 03:48:59 I do own some individual stocks, but the returns I used in the post for 2008-2017 were all from my TSP account so a blend of index funds.
2655 2018-11-25 03:48:44 More money to flow back into weed stocks
2656 2018-11-25 03:48:16 What I’m questioning is your assumption is that others who haven’t run are somehow going to get dumped too without even running

Maybe but usually stocks need to run to get dumped and become baggies

Just a discussion considering alternatives
doesn’t need to become an argument
2657 2018-11-25 03:47:48 If stocks don't perform for retirees, they'll pile into debt as rates rise. Someone has to buy all those Ts at the lower prices to mark the yield at 4% and beyond. But if inflation is 4% it's pretty meh. But retirees will be "ok" with this because it's *something*.
2658 2018-11-25 03:46:44 Pre 1776, we needed protection from a trained standing army that would take over a town,Boston for example and do whatever it liked. Took over peoples homes, took their hunting rifles, food stocks and BEER.
2659 2018-11-25 03:46:29 I'm not taking any victory laps until the crypto markets break down. Right now it's dropping slow enough that you can easily buy or sell. When panic finally does arrive there will be no bids at all. Happens regularly in stocks, crypto too, I bet.
2660 2018-11-25 03:45:00 18 FGA is promising and the stocks 
2661 2018-11-25 03:44:48 bakit walang stocks ng time magazine x bts sa nbs??????!!!!!!
2662 2018-11-25 03:43:57 For those looking to get into Stocks and Investing to make $$$, start by researching a popular commission free platform named "@RobinhoodApp
2663 2018-11-25 03:42:15 Hi Christopher, honestly it depends. The selling is getting a bit overcooked, but I don't know their short thesis. If it includes deteriorating credit climate (for macro and single stocks) plus say declining equity premiums then I'd think they are 1/3 to 1/2 of the way to target
2664 2018-11-25 03:41:46 And just BTW, people that really matter for the stock market (institutional) don't own cryptos.. and the guys holding cryptos most likely 95% don't own stocks (since they think cryptos are the holy grail).
2665 2018-11-25 03:40:48 So largest stocks, formerly leading, are more lagging. Will be interesting to see if it's bullish for the market.
2666 2018-11-25 03:39:44 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2667 2018-11-25 03:39:29 Bitcoin is crashing because the chart is broken, that is a typical move. Now in stocks the picture looks a little different, could go either way.
Fundamentally US stocks are quite ok and European stocks very cheap..
2668 2018-11-25 03:39:11 Imagine buying $AMZN stocks instead of $BTC 

OmegaLuL.
2669 2018-11-25 03:37:05 Sorry but WHAT, the Knicks have been one of the laughing stocks of the league for almost two decades. If we weren't we wouldn't be harping on creating this new culture so much. 

It is changing and I do believe this is true and good times are ahead but we haven't proven that yet.
2670 2018-11-25 03:37:03 Buying stocks in pornhub, 
legal way too pimp her,
Cash only no simp shit
2671 2018-11-25 03:35:30 Yes, Obama, since we are seeing the last effects of his economy, but we are starting to see the first effects of trumps. The stocks are starting to tank, we have actually lost more jobs this year then created, and companies sunk that great tax break into profits not workers.
2672 2018-11-25 03:35:18 Well, I've been buying and selling stocks, bonds, warrants, options, gold ... since age 12.  And during the day I work on the testing of heat shield materials for reentry vehicles.  So, good boy, Riffle.  Here's a treat.
2673 2018-11-25 03:34:54 My parents never owned stocks - they invested in payday savings bonds, lol. They were also able to buy RV-trailers and take world vacations (Mom traveled a LOT, by working 'til she had the $). I was the baby of the family, sis in '45, bro in '51. I've traveled a lot in the US.
2674 2018-11-25 03:33:04 My local superstore/grocery stocks them too, but they are top price lines. L'Oreal is a great brand - the only such company to have real research laboratories, in various countries to work on different skin types, & publish papers in peer-reviewed journals.
2675 2018-11-25 03:31:12 Have a repair shop that stocks the sunnybrook stuff, so I bought from him and he has parts there all the time. Go with that and end your search. You will be happy.
2676 2018-11-25 03:28:19 I’m well aware as my sisters were born in 55 & 56.  Our grandfather gave all of us stocks worth just under 10k that we all used to buy a house.  We got our first one in 88 for $68k.
2677 2018-11-25 03:28:05 Great point, and why this republic is in sad shape I mean when Dems getcthe presidency and both houses it’s all over
2678 2018-11-25 03:25:36 Watching these stocks is intensive 
2679 2018-11-25 03:25:13 I am now ready to take your questions regarding stocks, just tweet me the complete name of  the company.  No direct messages, please! #thinkervenu
2680 2018-11-25 03:24:18 You are going to get rid of bonds and then what? Pump $21 trillion bonds+ $3 to $4 trillion defixits per year out of into stocks, real estate, commodities and blow out massive asset bubbles and you think that is the solution? Are you brain dead and typing on keyboard from seizure
2681 2018-11-25 03:24:08 @BigHitShop please add the stocks of 2019 Season Greeting for the others too!!!!Please...i haven't buy it yet..Please....
2682 2018-11-25 03:22:05 Which sources? 'Cause so far, from immigration to bump stocks... You've demonstrated some challenges. Hey, just trying to help ya here. 
2683 2018-11-25 03:21:15 Best believe I’ll be buying hella stocks and cryptos hitting 365+ day lows! If you seen the last cycles, you don’t miss those opportunities. Literally have a whole stream just to take that risk 
2684 2018-11-25 03:19:57 It also comes with a complimentary ten piece grooming kit. Order now while stocks last
2685 2018-11-25 03:19:07 So your contention is retail are propping up other stocks at their lows and so rather than these stocks which are at their lows running like every other nearology sector run they stay low then collapse lower

So basically your saying “this time it’s different” 

Let’s see
2686 2018-11-25 03:18:11 @acorns I've been investing with you regularly for over a year, but the returns on the stocks your investors choose are absolutely Terrible!
2687 2018-11-25 03:17:33 It’s easy to drink with your grandfather’s girlfriend and everyone stocks it.
2688 2018-11-25 03:17:10 With mutual investment stocks right 
2689 2018-11-25 03:16:37 I prefer to cook my own because I know what I want in a burger. And it’s cheaper that way, in the end.

Most people who buy off-the-shelf end up replacing a ton of shit anyway; triggers, gas piston systems, stocks...
2690 2018-11-25 03:16:26 Greatland Gold GGP:LON shows a monster breakout on the charts, looks like a massive rerate is possible IMHO . A lot of nearology stocks likely to get hyped up and hand over losses over time to retail as usual. AZY and MCT look good on the ST charts.
2691 2018-11-25 03:15:33 I buy 80% stocks 10% cash in high interest savings 8% gold/silver then gamble maybe 2% in crypto, gamble because nothing to base crypto value on.
2692 2018-11-25 03:12:39 Humans have been hunting for years with bolt action rifles with great success. When did it become necessary to have semi-automatic rifles and 30+ round clips and bump stocks to hunt with? 1/2 shots should be good enough to hunt an unarmed animal with, or you're a piss-poor hunter
2693 2018-11-25 03:12:26 Bitcoin is #1 while Bitcoin cash is #4 on coin market cap. 

They have different attributes and abilities. They have different communities and liquidity pools. 

Bitcoin cash is the tungsten of crypto.

The rest are mostly penny stocks. (copper)
2694 2018-11-25 03:11:29 Who knows. One thing: it attracted a lot of dumb, speculative money. That could come back or it could find another home like pot stocks or something.
2695 2018-11-25 03:10:54 Okay, on a fresh stock, I'm getting an FAF of 25 it's looking like? Unless staleness lasts through stocks.
2696 2018-11-25 03:10:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2697 2018-11-25 03:10:04 Stocks, bonds, crypto, t-bills, commodities, etc....

At the same time, I really did appreciate how well it was written and the time you put into it.
2698 2018-11-25 03:09:20 Do you own index funds or individual stocks? And if you own both in what proportion? I'm working out your math 
2699 2018-11-25 03:07:57 So far wala ako nakita Ace. Like gilibot ko na mga genres na possible pwede makita. Bukas mag dating stocks ng mga mabilis naubos na books. After lunch daw! Balik rin gani ako tomorrow 
2700 2018-11-25 03:05:29 A company? That’s where you need to remind people that tokens are not stocks
2701 2018-11-25 03:03:47 I’m about to put y’all on game with trading stocks and crypto! While your money is sitting in a savings account, banks are making millions trading YOUR money. I’m about to teach you how to trade your own money!!
2702 2018-11-25 03:03:08 Beginners  the real money is in stocks. Get you a broker
2703 2018-11-25 03:02:18 Bitcoin capitulated before capitulation was cool.  Watch all the stocks copy now 
2704 2018-11-25 03:02:06 Me: *14 levels higher than final boss; uses mercenary same level as boss that beats two of its three stocks before dying*
Me: *loses*
Me: *tries repeatedly for like an hour, still can’t win*
Me: 
2705 2018-11-25 03:01:22 Okay but who would buy a book on business, I don't know what Michelle's book is about but probably is more interesting than how to buy stocks and make sure you don't go bankrupt
2706 2018-11-25 03:01:20 Idk that states laws but in pa that’s illegal As fuck. get rid of bump stocks they’re stupid n irresponsible. Most ppl I know who own AR platform rifles wouldn’t put a bump stock on if you gave it to them. We have more in common than you’d think
2707 2018-11-25 02:59:39 A few of the TSX.V stocks in gold/silver sector at 0.02/0.05/0.07/0.1 CAD price range likely to return killer returns like 20/30 times multiplication over 2- 3 years, Focused on them now. A few will be total washouts, so important to distribute the moolah over a number of stocks.
2708 2018-11-25 02:59:09 C’est une douille pour faire surconsommer les pigeons et liquider les stocks c’est tout
2709 2018-11-25 02:58:45 Really? Did they just lose over 1 Trillion from their FAANG stocks?
2710 2018-11-25 02:58:40 omg Roy up air

it can take stocks now
2711 2018-11-25 02:55:17 Feel sorry for a few Canada friends who are big investors in the O&G stocks They know the sector so well, they were just drawn into their favorite stocks looking at All Time Highs/Yearly Highs.Which is a wrong thing to do always.

2715 2018-11-25 02:50:18 I stand by my comments. No need to be in crypto.  Additionally, the options market for stocks is much much much more liquid than crypto.  #simple
2716 2018-11-25 02:49:53 He does if he has majority stocks
2717 2018-11-25 02:49:40 Jail, the stocks in town square, pull out all her toenails? What's the proper punishment?
2718 2018-11-25 02:48:35 The world is focused on falling oil prices and US stocks. Little attention is paid to the US 10 year treasury note which have fallen from its peak. That will be good news for US stocks but bad news for the US dollar.
2719 2018-11-25 02:48:07 A truce with China on Dec 1st is probably 50/50. Trump knows if he doesn't call a truce on Dec 1st it won't happen by Jan 1st and stocks will tank. Trump isn't going to let that happen. His job depends on it.
2720 2018-11-25 02:47:51 Stocks down doesn’t mean gold up ;-) and till now economy is booming like never before ;-)
2721 2018-11-25 02:47:09 2 lang po talaga stocks? Meron pa po yung selfie PC?
2722 2018-11-25 02:43:12 Lydia the carpenter is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is abducted and probed by Jeffrey.
2723 2018-11-25 02:42:32 @DanaPerino this weeks news reports say a lot of Facebook and Twitter stocks were sold before falling market prices maybe insider trading?! Check it out
2724 2018-11-25 02:40:56 Wtf are you talking about? Peter owns gold stocks in his funds.
2725 2018-11-25 02:40:46 International Grains Council, @IGCgrains; The projection for grain stocks in 2018/19 is unchanged m/m, at a four-year low of 560m t, down by 58m y/y
2726 2018-11-25 02:40:27 I’m definitely not saying real estate beats stocks.  Just an example of volatility someone can experience in the markets.  I can see both sides, don’t think one is right or wrong.
2727 2018-11-25 02:40:16 Coaches needs to go. GM needs to go. The guy who stocks the fucking vending machines needs to go. It's just embarrassing at this point. The entire organization needs to be rebuilt. Fix it.
2728 2018-11-25 02:40:12 I go for disrespect when I still have two stocks. Other than that I hardly go for it.
2729 2018-11-25 02:38:24 Romaine Lettuce: killed 4 people, removed from shelves of all stores in America, mass panic on social media resulting in immediate action by the FDA

Guns: 300 mass shootings in America in 2018 -- guns still on shelves in Walmart; bump stocks still easily accessible
2730 2018-11-25 02:37:08 No...after sucking in retail to cannabis at the top, he’s now pitching penny stocks with Tim Sykes. Sad.
2731 2018-11-25 02:36:40 You love your guns, and that's fine. I'm not suggesting that you shouldn't be allowed to own guns. No one needs assault rifles, bump stocks or devices that can be used as weapons of mass destruction. Restrictions are for public safety not as punishment for law abiding gun owners.
2732 2018-11-25 02:31:40 where do I search game!(est.right now) where do I search on the non-dark web for 1.bloodport/kumite2.convict island/purgethemeamusementpark…..cause I'd like to start buying stocks now please so I can get on the bottom...
2733 2018-11-25 02:31:21 Our stores have been f’n packed!! Tech stocks are gonna be roarin back. $SQ $SHOP $ROKU
2734 2018-11-25 02:31:21 Market cycle, it’s the same for everything.

Gold, silver, real estate, stocks, bonds...
2735 2018-11-25 02:28:38 Anyhoo, i went to kamiseta trinoma last night but the skirt was out of stock. Sales lady said there will be stocks next week. Jusko the wait charot hahaha
2736 2018-11-25 02:26:38 Want my stocks they are worthless
2737 2018-11-25 02:26:38 International Grains Council, @IGCgrains estimates #global #maize (#corn) carryover stocks in 2017/18 at 305 million tons
2738 2018-11-25 02:26:37 Yeah fair. We own pot stocks so... I might not be allowed? 
2739 2018-11-25 02:26:33 Opx. Puno na naman stocks q HAHAHA
2740 2018-11-25 02:25:53 -Better background checks
-Raising purchase age
-Banning weapons of war / bump stocks
-'Red flag' laws 

Sensible gun ownership rules already exist and can be improved.
Sensible rules do not infringe.

2741 2018-11-25 02:23:06 me & u buddy. that's what i've been saying since he got PUT into office. amybody with any stocks left need to think real hard over the next 6-12 mos.
2742 2018-11-25 02:22:12 go na mumsh kasi limited edition lang daw kasi talaga yung perfume :(( check my latest tweet nandun yung mga available stocks dito
2743 2018-11-25 02:20:50 And tech stocks based on nothing but advertising like Facebook.
2744 2018-11-25 02:20:45 You’re telling me. Stocks are down 14%.
2745 2018-11-25 02:17:40 I have it regularly since our cafeteria stocks it every now and then. As a vegatarian, love it. Can’t compare to how close it is to the real thing, but love the taste and the bundle of protein.
2746 2018-11-25 02:17:24 He’s staying because Trump Inc is making Big Bucks! He can sell USA Secrets while hanging with Putin and Saudi’s. He can let them know when he plans to screw with USA stocks, so they know when to bail..He’s lovin’ life.
2747 2018-11-25 02:16:08 What are gold stocks down since you told people to buy in 2012? 95%? Don’t act like you’re immune to the movement of markets and that “only others are suckers”... we are all suckers at one point in our investing careers. Admitting that is the first step to learning.
2748 2018-11-25 02:15:14 Weed stocks are talked about more than #bitcoin in day to day life.
2749 2018-11-25 02:13:34 If you pay attention to his off the cuff remarks you can learn a lot

He casually stated about 2 weeks before the MidTerms that if the Dems took the house a lot of people would lose a lot of money

I cashed out my stocks and bought Gold

The Market has dropped every day since
2750 2018-11-25 02:09:30 My favorite part is that almost every wealth management thing is a massive scam obsoleted by investing in index stocks
2751 2018-11-25 02:08:56 Very easy for me
Done successful exit call from stocks like
UJAAS ENERGY
Sumeet industry
In 2017 bull market
2752 2018-11-25 02:07:57 Maybe we could still be under Obama with no income and no stocks going up, 16.9% for me this year to date under Trump
2753 2018-11-25 02:05:56 Easier said than done when the stock is part of a brand new undeveloped (at that time) industry and is running away at 5-10% a day rate.  Was definitely a good learning experience being exposed to that era of pot stocks.  That time defined $WEED.TO and the industry as viable IMO.
2754 2018-11-25 02:01:59 Ths morning

Sis:dik go to pasar 
Me:why?
Sis:groceries..buy chicken n fishesMe:is it necessary for me go to the market? Kedai cik hamdan is enough (small kedai runcit in our house)
Sis:go jelah buy for whole week stocks
Me: ok...(getting ready and finished wearing tudung)
2755 2018-11-25 02:01:16 Cannabis stocks!
2756 2018-11-25 01:58:02 The dude took 12 stocks to beat one fucking boss
2757 2018-11-25 01:57:41 I did not say 'why bother'; what I object to is the polarising language on both ends of the energy debate spectrum. Demonising coal and touting wind and solar as some panacea makes people sound like they own stocks in renewables, rather than serious about our energy future.
2758 2018-11-25 01:57:34 Little late but for black Friday im giving 5 free thumbnails, profile pics and banners (in a bundle). Until stocks last! Get in quick
2759 2018-11-25 01:56:43 It depends. If they've got a million in a diversified portfolio of high dividend yielding stocks, they could make between 80k-100k every year in income.
2760 2018-11-25 01:55:38 oh yeah that makes more sense

i thought you were implying a best of 3 in crew battle format so you'd have like 9 stocks total per game
2761 2018-11-25 01:54:03 Stocks or Blackpink? More like save for the future or live for today. I want both
2762 2018-11-25 01:52:45 It’s been in a bear market all year   and unlikely to impact stocks
2763 2018-11-25 01:49:33 YouTube : Business Sells, Business Sells, Stocks up all the way!
Oh what fun, it is to demonitize and suck up all creativity! Hey!
2764 2018-11-25 01:47:30 ANG DAMING STOCKS NG DYOLAMB WALA BANG SHOP DYAN MAGPAPA- PH GO 
2765 2018-11-25 01:43:29 What are your thoughts on security tokens that act like stocks or bonds?
2766 2018-11-25 01:42:53 Color of skin has nothing to do with it… The second amendment, when it was written, we had black powder rifle‘s that took seconds per shot!! No bump stocks, no A.R. 15‘s, no large capacity magazines.  It needs to be re-addressed...

2768 2018-11-25 01:41:31 The stock market doesn’t fall until the bond market loses its shit and the fed is forced to raise rates to head off inflation. Yet they won’t be able to do that due to high amount of debt.  Which is why, nominally stocks don’t plummet, but just get eaten away by inflation.
2769 2018-11-25 01:40:59 That's correct. A bo3 consisting of 3 squad strike tag team matches. It's no different than singles because both will still only have 3 stocks.
2770 2018-11-25 01:40:35 #ZeroLeverage . I am all-in in precious metals stocks. But if u have appettite for risk a lot of money can be made shorting cryptos now.
2771 2018-11-25 01:40:34 Bitcoin is not an income producing asset (Stocks, bonds, real state), not a currency, not a commodity with real world applications (Oil, Natural gas), Not a commodity inflationary hedge (Gold). Where does it derives value from?
2772 2018-11-25 01:40:05 Yeah, you have a total of 3 stocks. You pick which characters you want to fill out those 3 stocks. 1, 2, or all 3 of those stocks could go to the same character if you wanted to.
2773 2018-11-25 01:39:29 Listening and loving it! I'm a new challenge student and the info is starting to coagulate. :)
2774 2018-11-25 01:38:02 Do you ever wonder where the stocks go on their days off
2775 2018-11-25 01:35:39 The global financial crisis has already begun. In the short term, as the stock market declines further, you will see many small investors liquidating their crypto to cover leveraged positions in stocks. Then scared money will flow from stocks back to crypto as it gets worse
2776 2018-11-25 01:33:34  ready for stocks this coming week?
2777 2018-11-25 01:32:20 An intentional lie, that hot swept under the carpet, just like he told the kids from parkland that a ban on bump stocks was a few weeks away and his enablers agreeing with him on TV. Where is that bill . He a pathological liar with no remorse, lies just yo lie , he knows no else
2778 2018-11-25 01:32:02 your eyes  are searching new STOCK to be spotted ,,Aise hi nahi 600 stocks aapke radar par rahte hain 
2779 2018-11-25 01:28:33 I’m buying myself stocks this Christmas 
2780 2018-11-25 01:28:06 Canadian white collar criminal law and punishment is a joke. Half of Bay Street would be in jail in USA if same laws would apply here 4all the games (reverse mergers,penny stocks pump and dump). It’s not really Canadian quality rather Canada lack of prudent capital markets regs.
2781 2018-11-25 01:27:30 Stocks will be replenished from time to time. However, we have no further info about the replenishment. First come, first served ya.
2782 2018-11-25 01:26:36 Jesus Christ my stocks are doing bad
2783 2018-11-25 01:25:23 I think the assist trophy thing makes more sense. If you play 2 stocks, and take someone's stock and you have 2 but are at like 140%. You'd still be winning, so by this wording you'd still have rage since you're not losing?
2784 2018-11-25 01:24:52 Never seen so many re stocks wow
2785 2018-11-25 01:24:40 #Crypto is likely to continue crashing with $USOIL & the #stockmarket over the next few weeks. It's possible that Crypto and metals recover quickly, and #stocks etc. enter into recession territory for 2 years. But crypto will need to make a fast recovery by the end of the year.
2786 2018-11-25 01:22:48 Did you guys know stocks can move without tagging 30 tickers and making outrageous targets? 

Stop over pumping people!!!
2787 2018-11-25 01:21:10 I know you could and theywould be competitive without a doubt. Knowing what you did with late model stocks and now with where you are now-The sky is the limit on what you are capable of building
2788 2018-11-25 01:20:40 Can you explain why transaction value is the right “fundamental” metric?  Sound to me like 1999 when tech stocks were valued on the basis of eyeballs (not earnings). How does transaction value translate to actual value?
2789 2018-11-25 01:20:40 Facebook clearly supports child trafficking and the normalization of pedo husbands ... stocks w continue to tumble...
2790 2018-11-25 01:19:43 I really check my stocks daily and throughout the day
2791 2018-11-25 01:17:15 Unpopular opinion: Cryptocurrency being down 90% is what investors call "Blood in the Streets", and if it makes sense for you, could be an amazing buying opportunity. If stocks were down 90%, would you say, "On sale because DCA!"
2792 2018-11-25 01:16:09 From The Mail -

"...second vote’ strategy. 

This assumes that if the vote is lost, the financial markets would be so spooked that the pound would plummet and stocks would crash. That, in turn, would persuade the Tory rebels and many Labour MPs to then back the deal"

Bonkers!
2793 2018-11-25 01:16:05 We will be at @LOEY921127__MY  cup sleeve event at Cafe Coffee Day today for Big Issue buyers meetup. We will also selling few official merchandise stocks (postcards, EXO 2018 Season's Greetings loose sets). Will let you know when we arrived ^^
2794 2018-11-25 01:15:06 So trues. In the next 2 years. There will be over 100 million people looking to get into Crypto. $200 trillion in precious metals stocks and bonds. Once this money goes to the crypto market the market will be $4 trillion in the next 2 to 3 years.
2795 2018-11-25 01:13:34 You know governments are reaching a very dangerous debt load when the interest in their bonds is falling and they blame the low yields for the lack of interest

#bonds #America #USA #stocks #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #ethereum
2796 2018-11-25 01:13:05 It was semi-inevitable. Nothing lasts forever. It has been interesting to watch the rate of change at the FAANG’s as compared to MSFT and a few other traditional tech stocks.
2797 2018-11-25 01:07:38 Tiene que corregir al menos en un 95% como todos los ath de stocks antes de reventar al alza, con dolor lo digo como 1200 usd
2798 2018-11-25 01:07:09 I'm a happy factor investor in the tradition of Jim O'Shaughnessy. But always looking for that undiscovered factor edge within my data warehouse of stocks and metrics.
2799 2018-11-25 01:06:26 No. I was not talking about bump stocks, but scopes, barrels, etc. Easy to build one that matches military grade.
2800 2018-11-25 01:06:20 Soon blockchain stocks will turn into marijuana (or cannabis to be “professional” about your drug business) stocks and then that will turn back into gold mining stocks once the debt-money bubble bursts.
2801 2018-11-25 01:06:09 All the rise in the stock market was based on expectations of high profits growth which seems to be unrealistic now. If profits are not growing considering that Current PE ratio is not attractive, there is only one way for the stocks and this is to go down!
2802 2018-11-25 01:04:12 Not surprisingly the “booming” stock market has been absent from his tweets for quite a while too, and that makes sense. Fascist Americans are more concerned about asylum seekers than stocks they don’t own.
2803 2018-11-25 01:04:06 He’s failing at this job. He added 17 percent of the entire deficit of the United States. Remember when he said he will help the deficit. Now we only have interest rising and stocks nose diving.
2804 2018-11-25 01:03:48 There was an iilusion that stocks were making new highs on ‘news’ or ‘fundamentals’. Plus analysts kept feeding fire. In Reality stocks were making new highs on pure momentum, bursts of sentiment

Had a crazy blow off type move.. this is what other side looks like
2805 2018-11-25 01:01:21 The market is volatile, these stocks were frothy, and are coming back to earth. JD has some core issues that may be worse for them than the others over the long-tem though.

The market will go up more than it goes down. It just goes up slowly and down quickly.

2807 2018-11-25 01:00:18 @PeterSchiff What is your personal asset allocation of #Minerals #Metals #Cash #Equities #Bonds #Crypto; What event would incentivize you increase allocation to stocks.
2808 2018-11-25 00:59:29 How will stocks f#ck the most people? My guess is try to rally next week, but just can't get a foothold. Longs bail for small. Back and fill then rips higher into December taking out the shorts. That rally is where I want to get really short. Subject to modification as we go.
2809 2018-11-25 00:59:18 Crazy that Day and Morales lost in both their DWTNCS and UFC debuts, yet you can argue that their stocks went up each time when put into certain context. Hell, Day could be looking at 2 wins in both of his tries if not for some bad scorecards. Hope they get favorable return spots
2810 2018-11-25 00:58:39 Fullstocks pata karon sugod mga lalabs naa pa stocks...dia  pako house morning lakaw ko unya hapon
2811 2018-11-25 00:58:35 Imagine what the world is going to look like when people realise that their savings, pensions, stocks, houses, and worst of all currency is worth nothing! The world is a like a ship that has sunk but everyone is still onboard telling each other everything is ok! 
2812 2018-11-25 00:56:21 $XOM - I will begin a position in #ExxonMobil next week. I've seen this movie before about oil prices. #XOM has a fortress balance sheet & dividend is now 4.3%. #ILoveDividends & I am paid to wait! I'll let the younger folks chase the momentum stocks that pay no dividends. $XLE
2813 2018-11-25 00:55:49 If markets closely followed by motivated,smart people = way to outperform is close eyes and buy risk portfolio because these stocks avoided and few surprising risky survivals= portfolio outperformance???Studies on buying worst perform 3/5yr stocks by industry+buying basket??
2814 2018-11-25 00:52:33 yung mga nagpasabuy sakin puro metro manila halos, konti lang provincial so give way ako sa mga taga-province once lumabas na additional stocks especially kay wonu :P
2815 2018-11-25 00:52:13 Why don't you ask the same thing about people killed in mass shootings? Republicans won't even ban bump stocks, but Trump fear mongering has you all worked up about cherry picked crime stories.
2816 2018-11-25 00:46:20 Yep. Part time job money. Been putting in 100 per week for about a year with some losses on Bitmex, but I quit playing with leverage too. I figure i want to own at least one whole bitcoin then start diversifying with Alts and stocks.
2817 2018-11-25 00:43:38 Really depends on how much time you have as well as luck and significant access to detailed information re various stocks and industries. Try many many years.
2818 2018-11-25 00:43:19 Mis referencias son mis cuentas de cks, 401k, stocks, proyectos, contratos, ganancias, nuevas oficinas que estamos abriendo, fábricas que construimos hace décadas en Canadá están regresando... Ahí es cuando se si un presidente está tomando desiciones correctas a como Obama- 0
2819 2018-11-25 00:41:32 Every block has a limit until the next block. That price is good til the next block. Price X at Time Y = current value. 

This equation is at the heart of txn value. Same issue Visa has with foreign based accounts. HFT Trading of stocks work the same way. Batching is the key.
2820 2018-11-25 00:41:06 What stocks “worked” in all of the other global markets in full bear markets?  Sometimes cash is king. Trend following still works and beta is beta.
2821 2018-11-25 00:40:41 The rate the bubble in crypto blew-up & the speed which it deflated, is reflective of the easy money, bubbles-everywhere era.
It also now serves as a good warning how quickly the many other bubbles can... and will also implode. 

Stocks, real estate, bonds, debt-money...
2822 2018-11-25 00:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2823 2018-11-25 00:39:07 Yeah,  huge corperatetax cuts caused corporate to buy back the stocks.  So again,  average people get screwed twice.
2824 2018-11-25 00:38:09 Hey, Grifter, have you ever kept a promise? Those tax cuts before midterms? Ban on bump stocks?  Spending more time in the WH than anyone before you? Or, less time golfing than President Obama? No? That’s what I thought.

2825 2018-11-25 00:36:48 @realDonaldTrump Hey, Grifter, have you ever kept a promise? Those tax cuts before midterms? Ban on bump stocks?  Spending more time in the WH than anyone before you? Or, less time golfing than President Obama? No? That’s what I thought.

2826 2018-11-25 00:35:20 trading stocks, indexes, yes, makes sense to keep original settings as these reflect a market that opens and closes, crypto is 24 hours, so TF does make a difference.
2827 2018-11-25 00:35:16 Individuals own stocks, so stock market increases benefit not just the super rich.  The tax cuts doubled the standard deduction which means low income earners have more money because they pay less in taxes.  Give things a little more than 10 months as well.
2828 2018-11-25 00:35:12 stocks 
2829 2018-11-25 00:33:26 Yep..maybe because there was at least some historical data / context/ experience of stocks crashing ..these things are new and that usually throws people off..like tulips.
2830 2018-11-25 00:33:21 INVEST IN PLASTIC FORKS AND PIPE CLEANER STOCKS NOW #ToyStory4
2831 2018-11-25 00:32:35 I just don’t get the point of this. Do you make fun of people when stocks crash?
2832 2018-11-25 00:31:05 It will moon after this, no after that, I mean this partnership, no not that one but this one, oh when the stocks crash, no you mean oil shortage, That's it Swell will move us, SAP,TIPS, that riddle is the savior we've been looking for. Shut up no you shut up. Charts say ect...
2833 2018-11-25 00:30:19 Good morning. At the moment, we have no further info about the latest stocks availability for all of our outlets. You may proceed to purchase it via our website instead while it is still available. Thank you.
2834 2018-11-25 00:29:29 Actually, many jurisdictions have legal limitations on spring-loaded blades, length of blades; you know, reasonable limits.

Thanks for mentioning it!!!!  Great examples that can be applied to assault rifles, magazines, bump stocks.

Well done!
2835 2018-11-25 00:28:53 Seriously twitter stop showing me promo posts from banks and stuff about savings and stocks like I'm some kind of fiscally aware, financially responsible adult
2836 2018-11-25 00:28:22 Because, distract and divert your attention away from real news and sway the non informed to be informed with misleading information. Kinda like how pumpers, pump stocks to gain money. He’s pumping fake news to mislead you away from the facts.
2837 2018-11-25 00:27:20 If they take the right lessons from the show it’ll at least teach them to come better prepared for combat. Then again a lot of DMs might not have fun spending hours before each adventure getting the party stocks with potions/scrolls and whatnot.
2838 2018-11-25 00:27:11 You clearly better at this. I'd be interested to see the same analysis done independently for FTSE, CAC, Nikkei. Interested?
The reason I used the DAX is that it's a total return index. I did the same for bitcoin to have a very different asset and not cherry-pick stocks only.
2839 2018-11-25 00:26:49 Kuha po kami stocks today. PM lang po sa mga may order ng shorts, bags and wallets.

Sa mga magpapasabay po ng cotton shorts at basketball shorts, pm na din po 
2840 2018-11-25 00:26:37 I have my mortgage license and I remember you working on getting your real estate so maybe after we can network! But as far as A1 credit, investments and stocks. I got you girl!
2841 2018-11-25 00:24:02 Do you think if people could vote the stock they hold index funds they would approve ceo salaries.  Why can’t Vangard vote those stocks and hold ceos accountable?  Why can’t you move your 401k to an activist fund?
2842 2018-11-25 00:22:34 i just think it’s interesting how when stocks go up Trump claims all the credit but when it tanks he blames everyone else for it (when often it’s his policies that are the cause )
2843 2018-11-25 00:21:57 Yeah but K-Elf had stocks so SM isn't completely at fault. But they still submitted to obsessive fan behavior.
2844 2018-11-25 00:21:15 Last 10+ yrs stocks lead tax receipts
2845 2018-11-25 00:20:19 Mark Zuckerberg don't like when all you Auburn fans log out at once. It messes with his stocks 
2846 2018-11-25 00:18:10 50% cash with 50% stocks--no need to pay tax gains, keep the dividends.

Stock part 55% hedged, so if disaster starts Sunday night cash position increases.

Being net short a tough call; especially with G-20 coming. Day-to-day on increasing hedge. 

Charts say stocks on precipice
2847 2018-11-25 00:15:36 You crypto bubble...LOL ..with a marketcap at this point 130billion.?
What you call stocks? Balloons?
What about real estate in every country...I guess balloons also..
2848 2018-11-25 00:12:56 Stocks plunged as The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation unveiled a inspiring remote today.
2849 2018-11-25 00:12:42 This bitcoin implosion... is it in some part a lead for further declines in fang stocks and US market in general ?
2850 2018-11-25 00:11:41 99% of the people who argue with me about stocks vs real estate have had no real experience, much less success, in neither.  They're just going with what people have told them.
2851 2018-11-25 00:10:43 It’s very refreshing to be involved in a community of real professionals sharing their experience and strategy in any given market trading all kinds of stocks, lrg cap, small cap, and etfs, not just scalping small caps from a scanner
2852 2018-11-25 00:10:04 Stocks!
2853 2018-11-25 00:09:06 The other problem is as Greenspan noted in 2015 “A surprisingly large % of US receipts comes fr stocks - if stocks just stop rising (let alone fall), it will quickly put pressure on fiscal side.”  IOW, as stocks fall, the deficit rises nonlinearly.  Yikes
2854 2018-11-25 00:07:45 actually, if Trump doesn't take Mnuchin's advice to strike a trade deal with China and declare victory and allows it to prolong in 2019..... US stocks will crater, economy will go south and his reelection will be almost impossible.
2855 2018-11-25 00:06:59 Not really. Chaos on the border with no attempt to reform. Stocks tumbling. Trade & tariff war not working as promised. A weak impression on the global stage. No infrastructure improvements. Tax cuts? Right. Actually, more of a nightmare.  #Mueller #ImpeachTrump
2856 2018-11-25 00:05:34 The DOW JONES lost all gains - that’s just 30 stocks! 30 stocks ONLY! I made 4.5% in my investments so far this year. If you are investing in the DOW JONES 30 stocks get a good financial advisor.
2857 2018-11-25 00:05:15 Tu sais quoi ?
On fait un deal.

J'te montre ma tête et tu me montres la tienne (en DM, hein ^-^(pas envie que les gens voient ma tête >.>))

Pas forcément maintenant, mais je suis sûr que tu es quelqu'un de jolie :3

(Non, je les stocks dans un fichier comme ça, copié-collé ^-^)
2858 2018-11-25 00:05:04 Facebook stocks are going to come down 50% more and CEO should be ready for it because investors are selling the stocks and leaving, new investors not interested.
2859 2018-11-25 00:04:22 Let me guess....!?  You're holding gold and gold stocks.

2862 2018-11-25 00:01:08 I'm laughing to hear that tRump has now turned on #Mnuchin  saying he picked the wrong Fed Chr and blaming both for the $tockmarket woes.  My dearly departed @Bizi_Izzi knew more about stocks than #Fake45 who couldn't run his own biz much less any others. HA!
2863 2018-11-25 00:00:56 People talk shit about the cannabis stocks but invest in something that isn’t even real lol bitcoin is a joke, cannabis is a real thing
2864 2018-11-23 23:59:25 @michaelgove hi sir your last statement to fishermens leaders was that at time we have to wait a little longer till the talks ie leaving and then new start our control no diluting or piece meal deals to neighbours stocks yes but the bulk in the small print must be uk  think 40mil
2865 2018-11-23 23:59:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2866 2018-11-23 23:57:37 Good! Stocks are tanking and preventing me from retiring. Thanks Obama!
2867 2018-11-23 23:57:20 Stop looking for laggard ratios like price to book. Look for stocks that breathe, that increase output, that grow. Avoid super fast growers
2868 2018-11-23 23:57:03 Isn’t Mexico paying for the wall? The President guaranteed Mexico would pay. He also said I’d be tired of winning. I just checked the value of my stocks and my retirement plan. I’M TIRED OF WINNING.
2869 2018-11-23 23:56:51 There is strong evidence that 'why are you still here' is a narrow, niche when it comes to those already here. This was unanimous in our @Nationalconvers 

If inflows do drop, I agree its quite difficult for people to notice that shift in flow, given past stocks
2870 2018-11-23 23:55:56 The Dow dropped sharply after the interest rates went up then they regained 400 points the Nasdaq dropped sharply due to tech market stocks posting losses in the fourth quarter. You’re 401k is doing fine it’s likely still up around 40% since 2016.
2871 2018-11-23 23:53:46 Stop chasing good stocks. A good atock at a fair market value means...3 years of price  stagnation. Look for undervalued, battered stocks
2872 2018-11-23 23:53:10 Trump said he could do it. That’s what he ran on. He also ran on being the best friend of the 2A, as he now calls for the banning and confiscation of bump stocks. And as he calls for red flag laws. He was and continues to be a BS artist. Ann is calling him out on it!

2876 2018-11-23 23:49:56 Everybody is chasing good stocks. Thats not enough. Thats just half the issue. The other is to find them at BARGAIN price ! Bargain price !
2877 2018-11-23 23:49:22 NOTE: I have no actual knowledge about stocks, shares, investment, etc. I just tried to make a joke out of what little I know, which is true bisexual culture if you ask me
2878 2018-11-23 23:48:54 @nbcnews  Doctors should have to divulge which drug companies they get money from and US Congress also should divulge all stocks & donations from drug companies. Public has a right to know.
2879 2018-11-23 23:48:52 Then why is job growth under Trump lower than the last 4 years under Obama? At the extreme, high taxes can strangle business, but at the other end, lack of regulation gets abused workers, and unsafe products. Trump tax cuts gave stocks a steroid boost, but did not boost hiring.
2880 2018-11-23 23:48:17 Ok Pelosi wants medicare for all.. now that happens the tax cut we got will go away cuz they have to RAISED taxes to pay for this ..then you can kiss off the xtra 10% tax cut for middle class.. you see the stocks is going down cuz dem won the house..
2881 2018-11-23 23:47:51 Wait a minute, nevermind. It's pics of stocks of console boxes to show "Look, stuff is selling well" on Black Friday. Armchair sales analysis much? smh lol.

2902 2018-11-23 23:45:45 Time to start buying some #dividend paying #stocks .. what’s your favourite #dividend paying #stock ??
2903 2018-11-23 23:42:38 This was kinda my point about MC.  Fundamental value of an asset should either be the NPV of all future cashflows (stocks/bonds) OR utility (a hamburger).  Not really any cashflows if I own a Bitcoin, and not really any utility yet.  I expect utility to emerge, but still vague.
2904 2018-11-23 23:41:49 Crypto and stocks may be down, but between gun nuts and anti-vaxxers there’s still a bull market in bad parenting.
2905 2018-11-23 23:41:20 Last year I had 25,000-30,000 in my #TFSA from trading #stocks daily. I slowed down my trading and currently have 70,000. One thing I’ve learned this past year is take your emotions out of trading and things will change immediately. Appreciate all the help so far from the #crew
2906 2018-11-23 23:40:49 No you are making millions off the Saudi's and Russians!!!
Now us American citizens are looks stocks every day.....loosing financially is not good for everyday working people!!! We don't have Saudi Princess or Russian Putin to bail us out!!!!!!!?
2907 2018-11-23 23:39:51 at my first tournament @FableSSB beat me with sheik, then switched to ics and wobbled all four of my stocks
2908 2018-11-23 23:39:49 Next:  trump orders treasury dept.  to buy stocks to make the market go up.
2909 2018-11-23 23:39:09 Romaine lettuce stocks are down. Indicorp stocks are up. All signs of a strong economy.
2910 2018-11-23 23:38:24 Whenever Democrats bring up gun control, publicly traded stocks that sell firearms tend to skyrocket. #stockmarket #guncontrol #politics #Democrats #Republicans
2911 2018-11-23 23:37:00 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
2912 2018-11-23 23:36:44 Agreed. Doesn't mean #Gold and #Silver can't go a little lower first, just that stocks fall even moreso. Then when the #Fed reverses policy, stocks will go up to a blow-off top imho, but Gold and Silver will explode higher by comparison, continuing the fall in the ratio.
2913 2018-11-23 23:34:09 Ben si elle baisse, au prorata du poids du prix du pétrole dans le prix à la pompe, avec une inertie due aux stocks. Et comme @marcfiorentino est de bonne foi et n’est pas un démagogue, il veut dire que les taxes sur le carburant sont trop élevées et qu’elles doivent baisser.
2914 2018-11-23 23:32:03 C'est vachement bien, t'es pas donneuse universelle ok mais tu peux donner aux A+, B+, AB+, et suuuurtout à des O+ comme toi. Au niveau des stocks c'est intéressant, car on préférera toujours avoir pas mal de O+ pour transfuser des O+ plutôt que d'utiliser des O- (hyper rares).
2915 2018-11-23 23:31:20 Short memory? "...So you aren’t in favor of background checks?"
BTW, we have background checks, in fact for 50+ yrs now. 
Bump stocks is silly... 
What do extended mags do? The Parkland shooter didn't use them and neither did the Santa Fe High School shooter.
2916 2018-11-23 23:30:35 Don’t follow it. My brain is too small to get IO stocks.
2917 2018-11-23 23:26:43 wasnt meaning to mislead, telling someone to "load up" on a stock that is going to do $90B+ in quarterly revenue and would have a P/E of ~9 isnt advice. What is bold is thinking it could get there and we would be thinking about buying stocks in the same breath as your other recos
2918 2018-11-23 23:26:42 More oil = lower stock values! @POTUS you just don’t understand how the world works do you!  You are destructer-in-chief of many Americans wealth (stocks down 10% again) by getting your Saudi friends to produce more oil and drive the price down. Collusion is rife! @DisavowTrump20
2919 2018-11-23 23:23:35 I don’t know you. You don’t know me. 
Your patience is applaudable. Your discipline is admirable. That report was arousing. 
I don’t do stocks but if I did I wouldn’t have been able to do what you do. 

I agree. Maybe take a taste of the water next time with managed risk.
2920 2018-11-23 23:20:47 I don't know a damn thing about stocks but someone commented once that Obama was a terrible socialist/commumist because the stock market soared under him. So I took a graph of the stock market performance and marked which party was I when it went up and when it dropped. DR
2921 2018-11-23 23:20:08 Who said you did? Background checks, bans on bump stocks and  extended magazines, no open carry are all comments sense controls.
2922 2018-11-23 23:19:26 The mentality out there is still, “why do I need to Verizon  or Coke when I could buy tech Stocks and make 25% per year easy”?
2923 2018-11-23 23:16:11 Au final j'ai rien commandé, ça ma saoulé les ruptures de stocks
2924 2018-11-23 23:15:36 My dad stocks shelves for Pepsi and owns a house but don’t ask me how tf that happened
2925 2018-11-23 23:14:14 local witch's well-worn book that can decimate all of the stocks
2926 2018-11-23 23:13:14 I intend to load up some more US U stocks now and non-US U stocks toward early 2019 to play the 232 uncertainty the best. All speculation though. DYODD.
2927 2018-11-23 23:13:07 No one is stopping you, give "all" your money away. I agree no one needs that much money (although most his worth is stocks not cash), that was not my point.
2928 2018-11-23 23:12:34 Big deal miniscule announcement but Horgan has big promises like wat a CEO does to sell worthless stocks
2929 2018-11-23 23:12:23 But no milk all substituted by palm oil and cocoa butter and other rubbish
2930 2018-11-23 23:12:23 We still talking about COD or R6? ahahaha welcome to 2018 where their stocks prices are worth more than your experience.
2931 2018-11-23 23:09:05 Crypto tokens and nasdaq stocks
2932 2018-11-23 23:08:01 Thanks but how do I buy stocks with $0.00?  I just want all the merch!
2933 2018-11-23 23:07:36 In other news pepto bismol stocks rise due to collaboration with japan and burgerking
2934 2018-11-23 23:07:29 That's the stocks and flows one, right?
2935 2018-11-23 23:07:19 With stocks of fish going to nothing everywhere I would have thought only British boats could be allowed access to British waters.
2936 2018-11-23 23:07:17 And all choc bars. Smaller choc, bigger price.
2937 2018-11-23 23:06:47 the only reason i have not sold any of my stocks is because honestly that shit is so confusing like Fidelity its 2018 sis why did i get transported back to 1994
2938 2018-11-23 23:06:22 Rumour has it someone is still trying to find the missing record from their stocks for someone who preordered
2939 2018-11-23 23:06:01 Dammit MG you really know the future, this is like 50 for 50 since I started watching you...I need you to help me with stocks lmao
2940 2018-11-23 23:05:49 ask papa swift for buying stocks advice
2941 2018-11-23 23:05:16 These guys are ridiculous, they just spam neg articles for stocks their short and vise versa...twisting things to match their narrative.

2944 2018-11-23 23:02:38 Chemical stocks, Tips, Fertilizer stocks, precious metals/miners, and other basic material stocks. Leave shorting bonds to the big guys.
2945 2018-11-23 23:00:47 When you see permabulls on your stream talking about anything but stocks, you know its bad times lo..and its only down 10%. High Beta only owners probably down 25-30%
2946 2018-11-23 22:59:55 You could named them AAPLE & AMZON two of your fav stocks !!
2947 2018-11-23 22:59:11 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood Want to transfer stocks to Robinhood. My account doesn’t have the “Stock Transfer” option on the menu, under Banking. Don’t see instructions on help center about this either. Help please!
2948 2018-11-23 22:58:27 My I miss Gauloises, no one stocks them let alone knows how to pronounce them. I live in regional Victoria, Australia’s largest inland city. No Gauloises for me, NEXT.
2949 2018-11-23 22:57:46 They probably make a fortune lending the stocks to Short sellers however.
2950 2018-11-23 22:54:33 Great way to invest in stocks the way that you want to without that middle man collecting commissions on your money. It’s your investments and treat it as such...
2951 2018-11-23 22:53:15 There's no such thing as trickle down. Bush invented that term. Tax cuts were across the board and stocks go up and down. If you're not in it for the long haul don't invest.
2952 2018-11-23 22:52:55 How about you politicians have the same health care as the rest of the country! AND! Not use your position to make money in stocks by making laws that benefit your political interests!
2953 2018-11-23 22:52:36 @PUBG Either the Uzi gets a red dot update or you guys add the MP7 with grip, sites, and attachable stocks. Also Exploding Crossbow bolts, i promise the use of crossbows will go up.
2954 2018-11-23 22:52:30 While you're both there-remind them that they only still HAVE a fishing industry thanks to EU quotas. If it wasn't for them, a bunch of greedy gets would have fished the sea dry 30 yrs ago. They seem to conveniently forget how low the stocks got before EU protections saved them!
2955 2018-11-23 22:52:02 Imagine if you bought stocks Starbucks and you’re only reward was getting a cup of coffee, not actually getting a return on the investment financially. Meanwhile Starbucks takes the money and is able to directly invest with it without needing to give it back.
2956 2018-11-23 22:51:59 @jay534 not all stocks have this potential.. This is a good start..protect ur profits w strategic stop loss ..maybe  over $1 soon..
2957 2018-11-23 22:50:40 Have you ever analyzed Vods with a top player? 

Do you isolate habits and what’s getting you hit? 

Find 3 things you can work on at each event and only focus on those. Don’t look at set counts or games / stocks as progression. Look at aspects of your gameplay 4 progrsssion

2959 2018-11-23 22:49:56 so okay... leafy left youtube... and bought... stocks?
2960 2018-11-23 22:49:51 I wonder if US U stocks will get overvalued by the time 232 is due and others undervalued; if 232 is dismissed, might be a bit of a fiasco in the short term with all the corrections.
2961 2018-11-23 22:49:17 Never believe that especially after bull market. This exactly led people to buy Infosys & Larsen in the past. Everything is cyclical. Nbfc who knew they would come down to throw away prices?
Just wait for electric auto/done solar  wave, people will forget quality stocks again ;)
2962 2018-11-23 22:49:14 I love when racks pop up into my bank account, thanks stocks 
2963 2018-11-23 22:46:20 Is about airlines stocks . Many arlines are enjoying cheap crude , except Avianca. Hugs !
2964 2018-11-23 22:45:58 The most important quality in a trader is the willingness to learn, change, and adapt. Stubbornness is tied to your ego. Kill the ego. #trading #crypto #stocks
2965 2018-11-23 22:45:29 Stocks are currently being replenished.
2966 2018-11-23 22:44:52 so maybe there was a purpose why he pulled this clock from Stocks, that kicks before 12
it may happen, there are numbers of weird things happening around, and loads of clues that not necessarily directed to us,
there doesn't need to be ONLY steady rise XRP fundamentalists believe
2967 2018-11-23 22:42:48 How to know best time to enter stocks long again
2968 2018-11-23 22:41:55 @uber take your booking fee, but rideshare drivers deserve the whole fare.  Operating a vehicle costs money and our time is worth more.  #uber is a bad investment. #stocks #ipo
2969 2018-11-23 22:41:40 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
2970 2018-11-23 22:41:27 Trump should know that a weak dollar/low interest rates caused the highs in stocks,housing,and oil.A stronger dollar/raising interest rates actually brings assets back to their actual value.
2971 2018-11-23 22:41:15 Tomorrow gonna start working on my pack again, need to add, create and delete some stocks out my pack and make some ccs and the cover then it should be out:)
2972 2018-11-23 22:40:20 You people are so gullible Nothing and I mean nothing has been accomplished. Gas is higher, food same, dow Jones now lost all the gains (notice Trump doesn't talks stocks or economy anymore) It is all flash cards to distract. No real changes to anything. Just loud white noise
2973 2018-11-23 22:39:56 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2974 2018-11-23 22:39:27 Oil stocks and prices are totally disconnected from reality. The market is trading off stupid tweets and lack of knowledge. Nice to see my one gas weighted stock up the week though. #buildthepipe
2975 2018-11-23 22:38:30 UK Market Close: Stocks little changed despite continuing slide in Brent
2976 2018-11-23 22:36:55 If i made a pack with bunches of custom shapes, stocks and CCs made by me, who would buy it :D
2977 2018-11-23 22:34:39 "The Top 20% pay 84% of the federal taxes."

The top 20% now own over 90% of all stocks, that's all passive income. It shows our entire economy is just pumping money to the top, that's why they have to pay even more.
2978 2018-11-23 22:34:22 The wait for quality stocks to arrive at MoS level is going to be too long. Which your watchlist also confirms

 Probably we have to keep the money for too long in liquid funds or bank FD waiting for the money to be deployed. And then waiting for the money to get compounded

2986 2018-11-23 22:31:19 The supermarket now stocks jars of Nutella with xmas decorations on them.
2987 2018-11-23 22:29:40 Wonderful visual. Needs to be updated with 2018 “stocks tank on fears of presidential harassment by Dem House”.
2988 2018-11-23 22:25:55 Best video online. It's about time these bastards got their cumupppance. And to all you guardian readers yes i would bring back the stocks
2989 2018-11-23 22:24:08 I think margin of safety is becoming an elusive dream concept. For Indian market, since the visible "inner circle" of quality stocks is very small, their PE will always be sky high. For other stocks, all numerical measurements available but not corp governance & promoter quality!
2990 2018-11-23 22:22:54 You heard what the Prime Minister said Owen.
Just get on with it and vote 'Aye'!
I don't want to see my stocks & shares crashing down before Christmas.
And neither does my wife...

2992 2018-11-23 22:22:24 Most of the time people are dying at least two stocks to some Smash4 equivalent to “jank” and that’s half your stocks. The stock count doesn’t really change the jank it just makes the jank more passable
2993 2018-11-23 22:21:35 there's only a zero if you care for fiat that much..  better of with stocks than
2994 2018-11-23 22:18:54 Fin du mois , dans la limite des stocks 
2995 2018-11-23 22:17:38 Yeah, basically they used BtoB.  And why not?  It's a business.  Plus, it seems BtoB is fine with it; that's how loyal they are.  Or maybe BtoB got stocks as part of their renewal contract.  Do you really think any other announcement could have done that?
2996 2018-11-23 22:17:34 If U thesis is right and stocks work, the last 18 months will have not meant much. what’s rocketed during that time ? Pot stocks and crypto?  - look how that crypto rocket ship has worked out - I know nothing about pot stocks so no view. All the rest is beta noise to me.
2997 2018-11-23 22:17:11 Trump whines about 3% rates, while stocks like $V are pumped up 1000%, $NVDA up 1700% in 10 years = effective annual rate of 26% and 33%.  By comparison, Warren Buffet's long term effective annual return is 15%.  #WallStShakeDown
2998 2018-11-23 22:17:02 Good evening, a chance to catch up, discuss stocks, pitches and watch #WarrenBuffet doc
2999 2018-11-23 22:16:35 Blame the passive index fund bubble for piling into tech stocks.  What may be overdone on the way up can be overdone on the way down.
3000 2018-11-23 22:15:13 The way to get the attention of the powerful is to point out the economic impacts. When stocks start tanking (which will happen), Republicans will pay attention. Profits are more important than people.
3001 2018-11-23 22:15:10 After several months of research, we're back to testing a new screener and buying system.  Great practice returns since 10 Nov.  #stocks #daytrader
3002 2018-11-23 22:15:03 Seems like angry white males with AR-15’s and bump stocks are our greatest threat.
3003 2018-11-23 22:13:52 Then why did Soros dump Facebook stocks the day before it tanked?
3004 2018-11-23 22:12:48 Step 1. Buy stock in H&K, Glock, S&W etc.
Step 2. Buy stock in Federal, Remington, Speer, etc.
Step 3. Post that all over the place 
Step 4. Smile as your stocks skyrocket!!
3005 2018-11-23 22:12:22 Stocks end the shortened session lower led by declining oil prices and falling energy shares. Dow -180 points.

3007 2018-11-23 22:11:13 You were so cute with your dictionary 
3008 2018-11-23 22:09:26 That makes sense. What is the risk? U stocks are so heavily discounted the risk of them going down further is low. On the other side of the coin if my calcs on supply demand are anywhere close to being right the upside is huge. Low risk high reward...like that arithmetic.
3009 2018-11-23 22:09:12 So proud of @Tom_Stocks in @GreaterGameplay @WaterlooEast . Well done to a all round Stella ensemble performance! Fantastic writing, great directing. My tear ducts are well worn out!
3010 2018-11-23 22:08:34 When it gets real bad with stocks its just called a crisis now. Lol
3011 2018-11-23 22:07:54 Concept: a banking system that works for your savings with an algorithm based science through compound stocks. While you and UNAM are giving back to the needy through monarty donation.
3012 2018-11-23 22:07:45 And "bubble" when crypto is up and "overvalued" when stocks are up.
3013 2018-11-23 22:07:35 Me: “Sir, I would like to buy all the Lion King stock you have!”

Stockbroker: “A. That is not how stocks work, B. I would advise against that because that stock is at an all time high, and C. Get the eff outta my Starbucks, sir!”
3014 2018-11-23 22:07:25 Most of the trolls that were all over #VRS have now moved onto #FRR - acting as an organised group to undermine stocks instilling fear & doubt. This illegal behaviour should be stopped. Blindingly obvious to anyone watching @TheFCA

3017 2018-11-23 22:03:01 Store Manager was a big job back in the day. They managed all the people and even buying. Your grandpa was probably sharp AF. 

The lack of glamour in retail keeps the stocks inefficient. Most good analysts do other sectors. Dad taught me a trade. I didn’t even realize it.
3018 2018-11-23 22:01:43 He's doing it to direct attention from the fact that another trump flunkee is a turncoat and is protected by Mueller. He also thinks threating will get his way. Stocks would plummet if he shut trade with Mexico. Call the bluff

3023 2018-11-23 22:00:38 Agree totally on Mgmt quality and execution skills. Just that one is always wary of repeat of history like IT Stocks like wipro at extremely high valuation in 2001 and then even after good earning growth , investor returns were subdued due to valuation contraction

3025 2018-11-23 21:57:25 I do not believe you should compare stocks to crypto... especially if we’re trying to break away from being considered a “security”. Seems counter-productive.
3026 2018-11-23 21:55:01 Hope I’m getting a good Christmas present
3027 2018-11-23 21:54:33 Stocks aren’t fully controlled by the president theres really not much he can do. In fact the president who helped our economy is Obama who set us up for success, which is clearly true as the boost started right away when he left office

3030 2018-11-23 21:46:59 Saw on @realvision the Grant Williams interview with Hays a week ago. Hays thinks next in Fed playbook (after the coming fall in stocks/JNK) will be to target SPREADS. Must mean they would buy crappy bonds to shrink spreads. No doubt this will do wonders for the dollar! Gold!

3034 2018-11-23 21:45:03 No wonder we’re tanking in stocks

1. GDP going to be 1-1.5  % in 2019
2. Fed raising rates 6-8 times in 2019 to 6-7 %
3. Global economy going down by 20-30%
4. Trump going to increase Tariffs  on China by 45%
5. Oil going to $30 a barrel in 2019

3036 2018-11-23 21:43:53 Pour finir ce que j'ai à dire. 
Toute opération commerciale est mise en place parce qu'elle engrange d'une manière ou d'une autre un bénéfice, ou qu'elle met en valeur des stocks dépassés. On comprend, vu le stock de fringues des magasins d'Harlem, qu'il y ait besoin de tout ça.
3037 2018-11-23 21:43:25 I’ve been thinking the same thing. My bet is that they will eventually act like healthcare stocks or staples during a recession.
3038 2018-11-23 21:42:34 But that is A GOOD THING!
Stock market is cheap and ready to be taken by the Poor and Meek of finance. They too have the chance to follow the next BULL run that will start when this correction is over, in about a year from now. Cheap stocks, good dividends!
3039 2018-11-23 21:42:24 Buy mayorkun stocks, he hasnt really reached his peak yet. Hold on to my burna stocks cos it might get hotter this december. Eazi is hot rn so its a sell.  If they were stocks.

3043 2018-11-23 21:39:46 I'm getting consistently stopped out of trades because of my pre-mature entry method (stocks were under 200 DMA).  Having far better success initiating positions in companies showing resilience during this time than the ones showing weakness appearing "low".
3044 2018-11-23 21:39:23 @a24 wow nooooo type of Black Friday deals or re stocks I’m so offended 
3045 2018-11-23 21:38:47 Good question, but I think for buy and hold, the more the merrier. I'm a big fan of just buying the whole market. If you're a buying individual stocks you need to keep an eye on them, therefore it ceases to be a buy and hold strategy.
3046 2018-11-23 21:38:43 It is inevitable with tariffs, higher prices on everything, interest rate hikes when we were just making progress we will see a recession. Stocks not good traders buying gold.
3047 2018-11-23 21:38:17 $FB - Look like on good support at 130 area .. it 'should' bounce from here now.. if not, than 115 is next area... Me think it will bounce at 130 area #fb #FAANG #stocks #trading #spy #qqq #BTD #BlackFriday

3052 2018-11-23 21:35:17 Yep. Too early in cycle for these stocks to withstand a mkt sell off. Folks don’t believe the fundamentals yet. That’s perfect. For those who are doing their field work and math it’s exciting.

3061 2018-11-23 21:25:27 For the second time this year, stocks have gone into what's known on Wall Street as a correction — a drop of 10 percent or more from a recent high.
3062 2018-11-23 21:25:10 All very interesting and feeds in to the debate. Thank you. 
I suppose more sand eels = more salmon is reasonably obvious. 

The impact of sandeel harvesting on sandeel stocks - and thus their impact on the salmon catch is more complex but arguably more important.
3063 2018-11-23 21:25:08 Stick to the facts Ross. What caused the largest decline in fishing along the whole East coast of the UK? When did that decline occur? North Sea cod stocks returned to sustainable levels in 2017, after massive overfishing from the 1950s to '70s, following EU intervention.

3081 2018-11-23 21:07:53 It's ludicrous to suggest the UK isn't capable of maintaining its own fish stocks or catching and processing fish for the World market. Why do we need any involvement from the EU? Where did they fish before we joined? Why did Heath give away our fish without being asked?!?

3084 2018-11-23 21:02:48 listen to the CEOs at your own risk. Most have been diluting machines for years.None of these stocks will work if the macro U doesn’t work. Almost all don’t do macro U. They rely  on the same bodies that cause utes to contract at peaks and producers to ramp at same time.
3085 2018-11-23 21:02:22 What are your picks? Stocks, ETFs etc?
3086 2018-11-23 21:01:44 Or you can transition to land-based closed containment & treat the waste water so as to stop harming the marine environment and its inhabitants.

3087 2018-11-23 21:00:13 Wow...that was a horrible day. I don't know if the kicking is over, but I'm about out of places left to be kicked. Did some buying of stocks I'd been eyeing if they dropped further, and boy, did they! Liquidity was a challenge, but enough that smaller lots worked. I'm exhausted.
3088 2018-11-23 20:58:08 Sure.  Ok.  And what do the pot stocks do when everyone plants 3 stalks in their backyards?
3089 2018-11-23 20:57:49 A common argument you hear about Bezos/Gates/etc is that all their money is in stocks so we can’t take it or whatever. If they want to borrow against that stock, they can. It’s the same as having the money
3090 2018-11-23 20:57:47 If you invested $10,000 in stocks in 1802 it would be worth $5.6B in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars.

3092 2018-11-23 20:56:02 What these shops advertise are a nock off of slow products that were stocked in advance. These stocks pick up prizes that actually allows the shop owners to make profit at the prizes they are sold currently. Shops don't loose on black Friday.They profit offering less value

3104 2018-11-23 20:47:40 So how is rump not a national embarrassment and as a leader has good morals, values or principles? He can't even claim fixing the economy when it was already on an upward trajectory. Stocks are tanking; incomes aren't rising; wife is an ex porn star........a mess!
3105 2018-11-23 20:47:12 Now your comments are uncalled for. There are certain stocks that have been over inflated. My portfolio is golden. If you are in a democratically controlled state who is raising taxes to steal the federal tax cuts take it up with the state you live in. Oh don’t listen to MSM.
3106 2018-11-23 20:47:09 So does dumping, dead, accidentally caught non-quota fish preserve stocks?
3107 2018-11-23 20:47:05 Fact! If your an Options Trader and dont have 60% of your portfolio in Puts your losing money. #fact #traders #stocks #bearmarket #wallstreetbets #f4f #money

3110 2018-11-23 20:44:11 If sports gambling is legal then tampering by the refs is illegal. Absorbing the risk of honest mistakes does exist, but when it's almost obvious there's shady shit going on it becomes important. Just like insider trading with stocks.

3112 2018-11-23 20:41:35 2) Since I started speaking publicly on macro U in April 2017 the price has gone from $23 to $29. Have been prior headfakes in the stocks on nonsense. Was no primary destruction like now nor secondary receding (mainly underfeeding) like now. The best thing now is for the stocks
3113 2018-11-23 20:41:12 But some lottery or Tesla stocks. It’s a lucky  sign!!!

3116 2018-11-23 20:38:16 I use TA for $BAT, $BTC, $ETH etc. However, TA is unreliable when a coin or token is still in its infancy-pre-mainet or equivalent. I liken it to barchart for trip stocks.
3117 2018-11-23 20:37:48 Oh look, stocks are tanking.  I wonder why? 
3118 2018-11-23 20:37:12 I think I need to keep my stocks up! Hopefullly it will be ok x
3119 2018-11-23 20:36:50 It’s looking like the ability of Trump and his Trumpublican flying monkeys to successfully sell their Great Economy narrative should be coming to the end of its shelf-life very soon. #stocks #Markets #Resistance

3121 2018-11-23 20:35:54 Good luck, sir!

I’ve never been Short stocks, apart from a few short $ES positions.

I don’t intend to start either! Hats off to you though.
3122 2018-11-23 20:34:55 Rite Aid stock is going for a dollar a share, if you’re interested in getting into stocks and stuff, you can start there, just felt like sharing that
3123 2018-11-23 20:33:47 I bought $FCU at 66.5 cents last year when U price was much lower thinking it would go up but has been dropping like a stone. I wonder how much lower #uranium market will go. All energy stocks getting killed (O&G devastated as well).
3124 2018-11-23 20:31:59 Easiest way is to disallow corps to write off mgmt salaries. Limit what can be written off to 6-10x the median or average worker's salary in that co. If that's 300k for a CEO, and the corp wants to giveaway 50 mill in stocks- fine, but the corp still pays on that other 49.7 mill.

3133 2018-11-23 20:22:00 What I'm trying to say is that as much as FOX News should get the blame for breaking the brains of your parents.

The real problem is CNBC and Fox Business, for basically making everything about profits to raise stocks and want these companies to "grow".
3134 2018-11-23 20:21:55 Evening Market Update: stocks close lower led by Tech and Oil stocks as US exchange closes early during thanksgiving holiday.
3135 2018-11-23 20:20:44 Yet those same Uranium stocks sure don't go up when the spot price goes up week after week. I think this so called rally was dead before it started. Lets just call it for what it is, no seasonal rally this year. Really too bad but this sector just isn't ready to see gains yet.
3136 2018-11-23 20:19:45 I'll go to Trinoma today to buy the watch. Was busy with work yesterday. Hope stocks are available pa.

3138 2018-11-23 20:18:32 It’s called dollar cost averaging and if you buy more you reduce your average cost per BTC. A common strategy in stocks if you think it will go up from here.
3139 2018-11-23 20:18:30 Hope so. I love cheap stocks.

3153 2018-11-23 20:02:48 Thanks man.  I traded through that 2001 Dotcom crashed so I am speaking from experience. I panic sold so many great stocks such as Amazon at $8 and totally regret it now.  

I am not making this same mistake again in 2018.
3154 2018-11-23 20:02:34 So guys, which shipper stocks are next in line ? :) lol.

3155 2018-11-23 20:01:41 There really are no "fundamentals" in crypto, in the sense that they exist in other types of investments such as stocks.  That's at the heart of why crypto had plummeted in 2018, including BCH.  The #cryptocurrency market is 100% sentiment, 0% fundamentals.

3159 2018-11-23 19:58:51 Here in the frozen semi-rural north, the issue is often zoning regulations: no "cluster housing" in many towns means no apt. bldgs or condos. Some towns employ "snob zoning" which dictates that a lot must be, say, 3 acres to build, so the pop grows, but not housing stocks.

3176 2018-11-23 19:45:35 2/ A more sophisticated view, sometimes touted by pensions, is that the risk (the standard deviation) of stock returns declines over long holding periods. In a sense, that's true: if stocks have a 1-year std dev of 18%, that falls to 5.7% over 10 years & 3.6% over 25.

3219 2018-11-23 19:22:16 BTW, the low tax rate on corporate income and capital gains, and higher income tax on top 1% would promote corporate growth and increase the return on 99%.

1. Spot price has to go up. (45% increase in last 6 months)
2. Global markets are now hurting us. Since 2012 most markets have made historical highs, U stocks fell.
3. URA is the reason stocks aren't moving up with Spot price. Complete 3 months ago, stock down since then.

3232 2018-11-23 19:15:06 Yeah because people want their 401Ks taxed. I don't like Wall Street because stocks are legalized gambling and a way for business owners to sell you a share of their risk and take a draw on their future profits, but taxing it hurts everyone because retirements are tied to stocks.
3233 2018-11-23 19:14:07 The recent slump in crude prices has come close to closing the gap in performance of oil stocks and the Lion King.…
3234 2018-11-23 19:13:03 You see me never talking about stocks. Because I have no money on them.

I talk only when I have skin in the game.
3235 2018-11-23 19:12:07 It makes me sick that 5 stocks account for 90% of the market gains. Pull them all down 50% and rebalance. The sooner the better
3236 2018-11-23 19:11:43 Let's c how stocks react
3237 2018-11-23 19:11:33 People speak about the Pump&Dump sector in Uranium stocks, but what I've seen in Golden Ridge Resources (GLDN), there is no U stock that has outperformed $GLDN in pumping &dumping.
3238 2018-11-23 19:11:28 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3239 2018-11-23 19:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around

3242 2018-11-23 19:09:15 I watch a reputable business insider type show n things aren't rosy w/market either, tech stocks taking a hit, losses exceed gains this yr. Rate increases putting pressure on ppl w/ccard debt, mortgages, after Xmas sales, it'll skyrocket. Middle/lower are classes in real trouble.
3243 2018-11-23 19:09:03 Seeking alpha is good for news, earnings reports etc, can sign up for notifications on different stocks. StockTwits is decent for other folks views but not to be taken too seriously, some trump bams in there.
3244 2018-11-23 19:08:29 The stock market decided to have it's own Black Friday sale #BlackFriday #stocks
3245 2018-11-23 19:07:58 What if there was a law that capped total compensation, making the RATIO of (for example) mid level Engineer or average salaried EE to CEO similar to what it was in 1975. Includes all stocks, bonus, etc. This would have to apply to all exec levels. They’d still make loads of $$.

3247 2018-11-23 19:06:19 Whispering, "Hedge your stocks by shorting natty."
3248 2018-11-23 19:05:34 Crypto 2018 being the internet in 2000 doesn't mean that the current altcoins will turn into the next Amazon. IF the crypto market will be as big as the internet stocks one time, I highly doubt the biggest winners are out there yet.....
3249 2018-11-23 19:05:23 @1simpletrader Played puts on the energy stocks you posted a few days ago.  Bought on Wednesday afternoon and cashed out this morning for between 60%-75% gains on all three.  TY sir and Happy Thanksgiving!  $FANG $PSX $PDX
3250 2018-11-23 19:05:07 Yes, quite a few stocks don’t make it to the second purchase never mind the fifth.
3251 2018-11-23 19:01:58 It's always hard for a GM to find the perfect moment to trade a player on top of his value. Just like selling stocks before they drop hard. But I do think today is a good moment to trade away Lindgren, but no rush of course if the offer is shitty!
3252 2018-11-23 19:01:56 I do understand the negative impact of #blackfriday on #independents and I do want to #shopsmall, but find me a #smallbusiness that stocks “plus-size” fashion or an Adidas stockist (par example) that’s within my budget? My entire wardrobe relies on that 20-30% off.
3253 2018-11-23 19:01:31 It’s alarming to me the amount of young folks who own large amounts of crypto and no stocks. Not for obvious  reasons, but because there are not enough advisors to talk them off of the ledge, and it was so easy for them to make it their first investment.
3254 2018-11-23 19:00:50 And 2 stocks

3257 2018-11-23 19:00:17 If these paranoid stock market people just have to sell they should look up what stocks  Eychaner, & Soros have & drop them all like a hot potato. That way the little guy can break the big guy. It couldn’t happen to anyone  better than these two bird brains.
3258 2018-11-23 18:59:48 The decline is also down to  declining fish stocks, which has to be managed in cooperation with other countries. Focusing on 'our waters' ignores the fact that fish can swim.

3265 2018-11-23 18:53:10 #Stocks,#Indexes  Forget the ragged top signal; no completion.  Concern now is a  potential, very large SPX TOP SIGNAL.  But this "signal" is most  unusual, exhibiting an asymmetry and duration, going back 13 days, sans  precedent.

3269 2018-11-23 18:51:56 Low volume days like today are always used to manipulate stocks in one way or another. No need to guess like a stock clown only planning and adapting like the big picture leader will bring you the bigpicture wins.

3278 2018-11-23 18:46:41 I’m not even sure why/how ‘bazookas’ entered the convo, (that’s just ridiculous) but re: automatic weapons.... of course you can buy them, not in all states, but many do sell them, those and weapons that can easily be made full auto, bump stocks for example... no need.
3279 2018-11-23 18:46:29 I’m concerned that veggietales facts is becoming too mainstream and their quality will decrease due to pressure from such a quick rise. How are your guys’ stocks?

3283 2018-11-23 18:43:16 World stocks mixed: US -.7%; Europe +.4%. Oil prices plunged almost 7% and interest-rates fell leaving investors to wonder if these were early signals of a growth slowdown. More likely random noise on a shortened trading day. World growth will moderate but no signs of recession.
3284 2018-11-23 18:42:47 CZ I’m sorry I missed your initial point - yes we should be oppositely correlated but there are some factors: 1) someone who invested too much and now has job issues needs to liquidate,
2) tether and other woahs are coinciding perfectly with the drop in stocks. #coincidence

3301 2018-11-23 18:34:54 ??? Confused me there JD
3302 2018-11-23 18:34:47 Hey! Unfortunately we've no current plans to stocks this item, my apologies. x
3303 2018-11-23 18:34:40 Stocks need to lead and most look like absolute garbage.
3304 2018-11-23 18:34:33 If someone holds the stock long term and the price drops an astronomical amount than it will cause the owner of that stock to lose money. Stock buybacks are good short term, but long term it will cause stocks to crash.
3305 2018-11-23 18:34:24 Corporations definitely have worth that’s what stocks define. Also I combine them because your study discusses how corporations are legislated differently than small businesses.

3317 2018-11-23 18:31:52 It’s all down to the individual choice  & market supply. Wheat was selling 38% higher at harvest year on year. Lambs post Brexit will be more of a challenge.
3318 2018-11-23 18:31:50 Stocks close at or near session lows. S&P 500 in a correction now. It's down over 10 percent from its September closing high. #BlackFriday
3319 2018-11-23 18:31:40 Eh. Depends what lens you want to look through. Lots of ‘bubble’ characteristics in tech and private equity. But stocks in general aren’t expensive on average (p/e ratios), and this pull back over the last 2 months I think more just reality catching up after 18+ months of growth
3320 2018-11-23 18:31:02 I agree with your premise, but individual companies are buying back their own stock and artificially propping up their own stocks, which is their right to do & is perfectly legal, but it's artificial stock growth. Eventually stocks will skyrocket and then pop

3324 2018-11-23 18:29:39 That's the same for virtually any food. If you compare the cost of a packet of crisps as a proportion of your income to the same 96yrs ago, they're cheap. #relative
3325 2018-11-23 18:28:14 All indices just fell 10% from peak. that is too little.

3326 2018-11-23 18:28:09 Stock Market is not the Economy.

Value of stocks depends on the supply of dollars from the Fed, not the health of the economy. They are both unrelated.
3327 2018-11-23 18:26:57 and btc is type low so..money can flow out of stocks into crypto lol. Discount rn people just scared it will go lower but I’m pretty sure btc will have an insane bull market lol (when it comes)

3335 2018-11-23 18:24:07 We often miss this. Mitigation and resilience needs growing markets. The existing dirty stocks need to be pruned to make way for new clean but the scale needs to be great enough to look like greenfield growth. If we succeed our infrastructure growth mimics  2000-2012-but clean.
3336 2018-11-23 18:23:39 Still cheap in relative terms though!
3337 2018-11-23 18:23:33 Your stocks levels have left much to be desired :(

3350 2018-11-23 18:18:15 IMO the recent fall in prices for FB, Google, other social-media  stocks is due to traders pricing in the threat of Democratic governance; same party that voted to repeal ("amend") 1st Amendment in 2014
3351 2018-11-23 18:18:08 S stocks fall on sharp decline in energy stocks; S&P 500 closes 10 percent below record set on Sept. 20.
3352 2018-11-23 18:17:58 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) have been so adored by investors that this group of stocks was given its own acronym -- FAANG. 

But, on Nov. 19, all five of these names were in bear market territory. Learn why we were not surprised...

The bull-bear spread fell to -22%, its lowest level since February 2016, and down from -0.9% last week.

3402 2018-11-23 17:56:47 If you're kicking yourself for buying cryptocurrencies at ATH, realize your doing the same thing if you're buying stocks right now.
3403 2018-11-23 17:55:58 That's why most people enter stocks at higher levels and book losses and wise people enter stock at lower levels and make profits.

3411 2018-11-23 17:51:10 Dec T-bonds are fighting to stay above 140'00 as options expire today. The drop below 140'00 during lunch Eastern Time is a hint that confidence in the long side is waning. You can always get back in Sunday night or Monday.  The consensus remains bearish for bonds but for stocks.
3412 2018-11-23 17:50:02 Well... I'm so glad shes in it for my "Stocks" and not that other thing.
3413 2018-11-23 17:49:07 The GOP has the NRA in their back pocket. making it difficult for ANY gun reform legislation to take place. The most @realDonaldTrump has done after the multiple shootings that occurred during his term so far is ban bump stocks. I think it's irresponsible not to have done more.
3414 2018-11-23 17:49:01 Lupin, Cipla & Divislab low debt amongst Large/Mid-cap Pharma stocks.

Sunph looks like game over. Pumped and dumping in progress.
3415 2018-11-23 17:49:00 Lisa, many of us here spoke of boycotting both of those companies. That sentiment would cause a heavy investor to consider near term problems for the stocks. Oh, I'm in no way defending Soros. I'm simply acknowledging facts.

3419 2018-11-23 17:47:57 Even as stocks remain negative, bonds and notes have declined, suggesting abandonment before the session closes.

3470 2018-11-23 17:19:41 I’ll buy puts over 17 in the intraday if we reach it and buy the higher high at 16 if i found a good setup on the intraday also.

3482 2018-11-23 17:13:19 Black Friday is deceptive. The prices are not cheaper. Malls/merchants use the opportunity to push out old stocks.

3485 2018-11-23 17:11:36 Stocks were getting too expensive anyway. But I agree. Yelen didn’t have the hardest job, but I think he should’ve hired another chick. They can understand the amount of emotion in this market/economy.

3487 2018-11-23 17:10:50 This contains bare faced lies.

- We're leaving the CFP is name only. EU still retains access to our own fishing stocks
3488 2018-11-23 17:10:38 Va y avoir des ruptures de stocks 
3489 2018-11-23 17:10:08 Same, and I think we’ll get 6-8 months to do so going into 2019 as the FAANG stocks recalibrate.
3490 2018-11-23 17:09:40 No incubator for these; we keep lab stocks on the shelf. Humidity def fluctuates this time of year, but I’m pretty convinced it’s a food ingredient issue. (Sugar content a prime suspect, as @DrRachaelF suggested.)

3581 2018-11-23 16:21:01 IMO, It is acting similar to 2011-2012 period.  Look at different aspects at that time that are performing similar, $GLD, $dxy, performance between oil stocks and growth, etc
3582 2018-11-23 16:20:45 It’s like the market is begging for the days of bad news is good news. Higher oil and higher unemployment can mean higher stocks.

3589 2018-11-23 16:17:07 Tax Wall Street so my Union pension which is funded through stocks gets devalued more and I can relay on the govt to give me money when I complain about not having a good retirement account when I’m old.

3615 2018-11-23 16:07:12 Chinese stocks are down but not sure what’s the effect on private financing / IPOs so far.. see Ant Financial’s round from June and Meituan’s ipo from Sep
3616 2018-11-23 16:06:59 Far as I can tell, the market hasn't priced in any Iranian reductions, given we're way below last October OECD stocks, yet prices are lower.

3617 2018-11-23 16:05:42 But big tech, for the most part, aren't value stocks. Are you saying that in 6 months to a year they will be and you should buy then? That could happen. Could be Nifty Fifty all over again and that would mean you have YEARS to buy big tech.

3671 2018-11-23 15:41:27 Your decision to tilt to small/value stocks has had a bigger impact on returns than your stock/bond split.

DFA Equity Balanced Strategy = +8.6%

*70% Vanguard S&P 500, 30% Vanguard Total Int’l
3672 2018-11-23 15:41:23 I am of the belief that IF we do get a rally in stocks back to the 2800s and #DXY continues to fall below 96 support, risk of lower lows in #TLT remains. That said, I am already long and the MT/LT direction is clearly up imho, pullbacks aside. Will add on dips.

3739 2018-11-23 15:13:00 RT @SmithBusinessCo: RT @jimcramer: Remember the value i am trying to add here. You should always be keying on certain stocks to spot a rally....I picked amazon because it's innocent!
3740 2018-11-23 15:12:48 Lmao what do you wanna do? The rich are already taxed more than the poor. The more money you have the easier it is to make more money. Rich people invest in stocks. Poor people cannot afford to invest in stocks. What’s your solution? (1)

3744 2018-11-23 15:11:18 @ExtinctionR By 2020 all overfishing must be ended without exception and the stocks thereby restored to good health.  However, the Commission has often continued to ignore the scientific advice in issuing its proposals - especially for more valuable stocks.

- it’s not the primary ETF market that moves markets down, but investors selling ETF’s
3757 2018-11-23 15:07:05 Canadian energy stocks now back to 2003 levels. Investors should thank central banks for flattening the yield curve and thank clueless advisors for steering them into these funds. Remember: there’s no #FreeLunch
3758 2018-11-23 15:05:58 “ Stocks spend far more time in a bull market than in correction, downside at some point in the future is inevitable. Dividends can help lessen the magnitude of this downside. A regularly paid dividend can be reinvested back into more shares of dividend-paying stock. “

3761 2018-11-23 15:04:45 Oh boy... where to start:

- ETF’s have intrinsic value (AUM / shares)
- ETF’s can be redeemed for a portion of assets or cash
- market makers need to use a specific basket of shares, specified by the issuer, they can’t just gather a random ‘selection of stocks’ that suits them

3768 2018-11-23 14:59:11 “ Therein lies the rub with dividend stocks: We want the highest yield possible, but with virtually no risk. Unfortunately, yield and risk tend to go hand in hand. In other words, the higher the yield, the more likely it proves unsustainable. “

3771 2018-11-23 14:58:10 This economy is a fake economy. It has never been as what we are told. Corporations in debt for buying back stocks and not putting money back into their company as in expanding and higher wages for employees.

3774 2018-11-23 14:56:31 People don’t buy stocks to use or consume them , like they do items in a store. They buy to resell at a higher price. It’s a common refrain but the analogy doesn’t hold up .

But then, you also don’t wanna get too heavy long either with this market that moves everywhere yet nowhere.

3804 2018-11-23 14:49:15 I mean it's the perfect system for them since they dont lose any money during the crash. Hell them pulling their stocks and investments just as the oil dries up is a huge factor as to why it crashes. 

Problem is oil doesn't have bubbles very often anymore

3811 2018-11-23 14:47:44 Nasdaq w/tech stocks leading back up while oil/S&P leading down.  The S&P in my mind hadn't fallen into -10% correction status and needed to test the lows.  I'm still expecting a bounce, against better judgement that we may very well be in a bear market now.

3933 2018-11-23 13:56:23 From my experience as a new home sales consultant lower gas prices helps #builders such as $tol $phm $len and $hd $low  - After Gas prices spiked in 2005 - sales traffic fell off a cliff so gas prices on the way down may give these stocks a short term lift.

3995 2018-11-23 13:20:28 We aren’t really into Black Friday shopping, but our stocks love it. So get out there and spend some money!

4002 2018-11-23 13:18:16 Quelle est la différence selon vous Mathieu, entre une entreprise tartanpion qui emprunte pour financer des stocks qui serviront à être vendus et une entreprise qui emprunte pour l'achat de MP afin de produire un bien ou un service suite à des bons de commande ? ;)

4004 2018-11-23 13:17:50 Pls shut up. What’s driving the stock market isn’t the Dems or DJT, although he takes credit all the time when market was up. The market is doing what it always does. During Obama’s terms the market went up more than it did for DJT 21/2 yrs. 55% of Americans don’t own stocks. Zip
4005 2018-11-23 13:17:09 People lost a lot of money because CNBC and you are still parading these people like this some type of real asset. Stop and while you are at it stop hyping marijuana stocks and hold analysts accountable for their ridiculous predictions #please
4006 2018-11-23 13:17:05 Wow are you really this stupid? The feds look to the future. What they see is a dem house. They reacted. Stocks plunge. Wow not hard to figure out.
4007 2018-11-23 13:14:47 I understand that. And I had the items in my cart, so stocks were there. The point that I'm making is that I had them and then didn't because of YOUR system failure, not because stock ran out.
4008 2018-11-23 13:14:33 Forget the wall, deficit already hitting historic high, why add to it. Wake up your wall isn’t getting built. No mention of stocks? Why? When are you going to tell your base that most of our oil 40% from Canada? Saudi Arabia needs us more then we need them, nice going. Traitor

Dunno about whether they lack skin in the game though; it is managed for the long term benefit of the tribe, and it attracts critics for being too conservative. (Compare: What should a surgeon look like?)

4028 2018-11-23 13:06:57 Its actually the Federal Treasury that prints the money and then hands it over to the banksters. They just gave them 4 trillion dollars under Bush and Obama. That's yet to be unwound as they raise interest rates. That is why stocks are falling. No more cheap money for buybacks

4087 2018-11-23 12:38:07 If the government hadn’t done that we literally wouldn’t be able to have this conversation. The problem is that these companies then don’t pay taxes and just use the money to buyback stocks and distribute more dividends.

Most of us can't even wait patiently for '365 mins' and expect 7% odd investment return from Equities/Stocks :)

365 mins = (almost) 1 day's trading session :)

4123 2018-11-23 12:12:21 0.08% of the Scottish population are fishermen. The rights to a huge chunk of Scotland's fish stocks are controlled by just 5 very wealthy families. Fishing is not unimportant, but it certainly shouldn't be the overriding national priority. #Nevertrustatory

4130 2018-11-23 12:09:31 It's a shame, but so many people who try to keep a close eye never want to forecast this. Always before a big Jewish holiday the market goes down. Some stocks substantially. Then prior to the holiday they surge again. Giving them plenty of money for the holidays.

4136 2018-11-23 12:03:12 Oui c'est vrai c'est pas du tout écologique de baisser les prix pour vider les stocks. Bien moins que de faire un feu de camp géant des invendus présenté en prime-time par des ministres et des Elise Lucets qui touchent 20k€ pour faire la morale aux salops de consommateurs
4137 2018-11-23 12:01:55 Street traders are being treated like criminals,their stock in being taken,when they go to pay fine,they always found out that,some of their stocks are missing,which means those stocks are being stolen by them

4147 2018-11-23 11:57:24 Weird line baffles me. How do you engineer it? The market will have priced this risk. FTSE 100 down cos people think mini global boom is over. Oil/trade war complicates. Should worry over global FTSE stocks outperformance versus poor domestic. Good luck getting MPs to understand.

4149 2018-11-23 11:55:30 I'm not biased. If BTC stays the standard, I win. If XRP becomes the standard, I win. If property and stocks get tokenized on the ETH network, I win.

4158 2018-11-23 11:46:48 We may be doing the right thing and not make a penny and in contrast get lucky at times and make lot of money in low quality stocks. We have to separate luck from a good / proven process that usually (though not always) work for us.

It meant less proceeds to FnF & a higher return to investors.

4231 2018-11-23 10:56:44 Anyway,do you remember the cod wars(pre CFP) when the U.K. had almost fished out its own waters?the CFP has helped preserve stocks.the benefits of EU membership are also for ordinary people not just business.FOM,protections of EU citizenship for starters.
4232 2018-11-23 10:56:19 I need to secure stocks first for Vivace Version before we release our form kasi until Sunday lang ang pre-order date. So most likely by tomorrow ko siya mapopost. ALL IN price will range from 690~750. I will hoard naman so no worries :) Longer DOP is a yes. 
4233 2018-11-23 10:55:55 Thanks Pal. Me and You did well together last time mate. The Tops Ci$sco Multi-Bagger Team didnt we mate. Really Nice to see you back. Hers to re-creating what we did before together on stocks. Boom
4234 2018-11-23 10:55:53 Yes. Lugi ka kung nagtayo ka ng store tapos wala naman palang demand kasi paano mo babayaran ang rent mo sa space dun sa mall? Tapos sayang stocks 
4235 2018-11-23 10:54:33 Didn’t check warrants just had other gap and red days so figured same would happen. Low volume@etc
4236 2018-11-23 10:54:30 Yeah mate it is. I like the volatility of this mkt. It suits me because you get wild swings and there are some great trade ops over and over again bouncing off supports and hitting resistance levels. If You get on the right stocks at the right time there is good money to be made
4237 2018-11-23 10:53:32 Well thanks for the sevice. Bump stocks are now being made illegal last I heard
4238 2018-11-23 10:52:00 Looking forward to seeing big business begin to use WSV tokens for loyalty points, stocks, and more. #BitcoinSV is business. Wormhole is here to compete.

4260 2018-11-23 10:37:56 I believe we are pass the stage where question on bitcoin existence would make sense. It's can only plummet so much, remember it's decentralized no group of whales or investors have power to crash crypto like stocks. 1/2

4282 2018-11-23 10:25:01 Knowingly and voluntarily investing in a pension scheme with all that has happened in the past is no different to gambling. When you lose out, you cant expect sympathy. Investing in stocks is a far better option.
4283 2018-11-23 10:24:49 I tried asking earlier pero ang stock nila ay may expiry date ng end of October. No feedback yet from DOH kung kelan magrelease ng new stocks.

4289 2018-11-23 10:18:16 20+ years ago I worked in finance (stock option market-making), we had precisely zero stability issues on DEC/VMS. We were forced by the exchange to install systems running NT to trade stocks (which we used to hedge our positions). We lost a shitload due to glitches and crashes.

4300 2018-11-23 10:06:18 I avoid con notes like the plague. Go through all the stocks in the past 2 or 3 years with con notes and look at the SP now. There's probably 1 rare one but most will have plummeted.
4301 2018-11-23 10:04:49 Gambling, gaming, legal, banking, social media and most importantly, identity 

It just happens to also act as money, but just like it acts like stocks, we don’t also call them stocks. It is tokens. It is both. It is all! Blockchain use case is decentralize everything
4302 2018-11-23 10:04:44 Right. But it’s not even S=I - that’s a flow-flow identity. The graph refers to stocks of ‘capital’ and ‘wealth’. Why should there be any relationship between r and the ‘desired stock of wealth’ as a percentage of GDP?
4303 2018-11-23 10:04:23 Now a smart investor, on the other hand, would take advantage of such great prices, buy a million stocks and hold for the long-term. Amazon stock is currently at $1516. Doesn't take a genius to know you'd be a fricking billionaire by now... Don't let this crap scare you.
4304 2018-11-23 10:03:20 Thank you but I'm not buying anymore resource / energy stocks as I'm bearish over the mid term plus is risen v strongly already. Let's be honest I've missed the fast easy money here.

4318 2018-11-23 09:58:04 By the look of it most stocks seem cyclical. If they had chosen consumer stocks such as nestle etc I'm sure the story might have been different. If u want to invest for a very long time u need to be in what will never change.

23 November 2018
South African markets closed in the red yesterday, pulled down by broad based losses in mining sector stocks. 111 stocks closed higher, 125 closed lower and 190 were unchanged. The All Share fell by 0.26%
What to watch today
4349 2018-11-23 09:29:36 It's also the most accessible, in a different time. Almost everyone on earth can join, even with a small piece (instead of big stocks) and has access to lot's of information (pro & con). This has never been possible before and could become (is) a worldwide currency.

There is an adage: It is not a stock market, but a market of stocks. So, when investing, pick a stock and focus on the strong fundamentals of the company you invest in. Ensure that your investment decision is not solely on the recent market performance.

4481 2018-11-23 08:01:14 RT APompliano: Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.

It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.

It has dwarfed stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities since inception too.

Ignore the noise, trust the code.

4484 2018-11-23 08:00:05 Buffett's Philosophy....Buffett follows the Benjamin Graham school of value investing. Value investors look for securities with prices that are unjustifiably low based on their intrinsic worth... investor searches for stocks that they believe are undervalued by the market

Flicking through my watchlist and nearly every stock is sitting at or near their 2018 low.

4513 2018-11-23 07:39:16 Please let me get out of my S&P long before any panic sets in, lol. Sentiment on stocks right now is at an EXTREME low ... I will be surprised to see another selloff today, but with low volume, any amount of trickery is possible.
4514 2018-11-23 07:39:15 You are completely right on this point. The entire aim is to make people hate BTC so they can stockpile it! Once their position is solid they will reverse sentiment, suddenly everyone will want BTC! BUT "they" will loose control and then sky's the limit! I have seen it in stocks.

4561 2018-11-23 06:53:16 Obama inherited a deep recession thabks to GOP. Stocks hit 7000 while unemployment soared. He literally pulled US out of deep shit, saved auto makers & handed a thriving economy to Trump.

4567 2018-11-23 06:48:31 Analysts give sell call because they will buy when the price will go down. These days analysts are negative on IT stocks and they are buying huge IT stocks at current discounted price
4568 2018-11-23 06:48:19 This isn't exactly an either or kind of situation. That said, what's more realistic: taking certain high capacity guns, bump stocks etc off the market or addressing the millions of reasons murderers kill?

4575 2018-11-23 06:41:56 hey noob! lol! "Riskiest"...LOL! not!  Stocks and  Futures are more leveraged than any other asset in addition to a 50% margin requirement.  not to mention trading Crypto has no margin calls (exception Bitfinex and BitMex)...and 100X is a option.   Forex offers 500X leverage

4583 2018-11-23 06:33:13 (Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks were mostly weaker on low volumes, rounding out a third week of losses on a note of caution. The pound kept its gains following a breakthrough over the Brexit deal between the U.K. and EU.

4609 2018-11-23 06:14:06 You may not personally know anybody among your family/friends, but trust me, there are people who have made big money in stocks, over the period of last 1-2 decades. Most of these would be "buy-and-hold" kind of people, with lots of patience.
4610 2018-11-23 06:13:59 The people with the most money are incentivized to spread FUD with the intention of buying the blood for cheap. #crypto #stocks
4611 2018-11-23 06:12:22 Not enough diversification for buy-and-hold. Plus 2000 was the peak of the tech boom, a lot of the companies there were tech stocks. Bad combination!
4612 2018-11-23 06:11:21 Times like these which start to separate the quality stocks from the not so quality. Enjoy!
4613 2018-11-23 06:09:10 These people should just sit and watch their stocks fall cause they can’t prop em up any longer and ppl with the sense to respond to what markets r telling them and get on board can watch their investments reap rewards and laugh all day long and the rest of us can cheer.
4614 2018-11-23 06:08:05 No he can't, he's just here blame it on Democrats. Fox News told him to. Literally the other day they said that stocks are going down because Democrats won the midterms.

4624 2018-11-23 06:01:28 He was allegedly able to edit Facebook for fake news.  One of the secrets to his success is his access to powerful people who can help get control of wealth producing stocks, mines, & NR. That way he can influence the market, profit from market, and prevent loss. FB in trouble.

4660 2018-11-23 05:28:26 Bombardier, the king of the backward, behind closed doors, deals. I worry they aren't and haven't been acting in the minority shareholders' best interest.

4662 2018-11-23 05:24:42 I just had to calm a few relatives down earlier because they wanted to sell now. 

The common thing they all said was “I will sell now and rebuy it at a lower price”.

This reminds me so much of the 2001 Thanksgiving dinner I had where it was laughed at for owning dotcom stocks.

4673 2018-11-23 05:13:59 I’m pretty sure Dicks still sells them. They bumped up the buy age & stopped selling bump stocks and any “assault style weapon”. @DICKS caved to the left so they certainly don’t need conservatives money!

4694 2018-11-23 04:57:46 @peteto   Not even a 1% chance ya dummy. Stick to penny stocks. You’re not ready for this board
4695 2018-11-23 04:56:36 When you give away all your money and have no stocks, bonds, IRA or and other form of side cash and live paycheck to paycheck then and only then will understand the forgotten man. You want us to give billions of our hard earn tax dollars to other countries, not happening
4696 2018-11-23 04:55:46 Huh?  What does Aphria have to do with this?  I don't short stocks and I was just interested in your profit equation.  Aphria has one in 2019.  With or without Altria/Diageo they will be very profitable in 2019.

4703 2018-11-23 04:52:18 don't forget to include the value of real Estate, Art, gold and other store of value items, not just stocks
4704 2018-11-23 04:51:15 You buy stocks when the price has fallen below the ‘value’ of the company - that’s basic. 

I was too late to realise that it’s also important to enumerate the reasons (or conjectures) as to what has led to this divergence.

This helps in risk mitigation and position sizing.
4705 2018-11-23 04:51:10 Some top 100 stocks down 50% on the year. Bitcoin a bit over 70%. Will you call stocks a bubble? #FUD all you guys good for
4706 2018-11-23 04:50:47 Honestly, I’m worried public executions may be next..or at the very least the stocks.

4709 2018-11-23 04:48:49 As much as I love this kind of poll.. can you take anything from the result? The audience likely to view this is much more biased towards bitcoin, and may know nothing about stocks, real estate or bonds

4712 2018-11-23 04:45:37 you really do not need anything more than AVL  , a buy at 2.0 c /2.2 c and SRN a buy now. both these stocks are more than enough to play the Va story .
4713 2018-11-23 04:44:52 So, all in all, its mania was a shell game in a industry with no oversight, and its value, still isnt worth more than certain stocks, or stores of value the world uses in much more stable conditions.
4714 2018-11-23 04:44:01 The leaders of the intel agencies are out, dollar stronger than ever, the tech only works on the backs of the masses, but its still fragile; 51%, Quantum, and a valuation, even away from suspect creation, which still must be considered, has to involve weighing against stocks.

4720 2018-11-23 04:40:11 We are talking money not stocks. Network effects accrue to the first mover, and Bitcoin is the culmination of decades of work. including bit gold, ecash and numerous others. Bitcoin solved the problems of the predecessors.
4721 2018-11-23 04:39:33 mate on the ASX kindly remember the following rule for resource stocks
Your buying price determines your profits.
Your selling price determines your losses.
If you think about it you will know what I am saying.

4724 2018-11-23 04:37:21 S&P 500 just had it's worst start to a fourth quarter through 37 trading days since 2008.

4730 2018-11-23 04:29:20 Seems you only see what you want to see. Here:
The value of the stocks only holds up if the underlying businesses are seen to be healthy long term.
So investors must have a view to the long term when selecting stocks, and thus entrepreneurs and CEOs must maintain long term focus.
4731 2018-11-23 04:27:33 BCZ HE CAUSES IT when he wants to. If he sees it coming anyway, he does it to control WHEN so he MAXIMIZES his cash flow, and uses it to buy more stocks, more CONTROL at cheaper prices

4802 2018-11-23 03:19:07 Having fewer stocks in your portfolio increases your odds of generating a higher return. But it also increases the volatility of that portfolio. In other words, the daily pricing of your portfolio will bounce around more.

It's like saying "the stocks can't be tanking today because in January they did well for a bit...."
4814 2018-11-23 03:07:56 mahal daw ticket prices sa black pink kelangan daw kasi humabol ni yg sa stocks since wala ang bigbang wahahahaha
4815 2018-11-23 03:07:19 Is “loosing” on a stocks like throwing a dart at the financial pages, but with a bow and arrow? I’m thinking a whole new industry of broadhead diversified ETFs must be nocking-on the door and ready to draw-back the curtain on investing success. Too many archery puns?

4818 2018-11-23 03:06:34 If an asset class moons, whether be luck or by proof of concept, people could boost being right. Someone could have said the same year 2000 hodling dotcom stocks. "See I've been right all the time."

Lighten up though, since that sentence was not meant to be taken too seriously.
4819 2018-11-23 03:06:23 If you really cared about Scottish fishing then you’d get us out of the EU. It’s outrageous that Spanish and French ships are allowed to pillage our fish stocks at will. Fish markets across Scotland have also been decimated by ludicrous EU fishing regulations.

4830 2018-11-23 02:57:53 Ask 100 people who should pay a higher tax rate, people who earn income by working, or people who get income from stocks that go up in price? Then ask who actually pays a higher rate. In the old battle of capital versus labor we stack the deck against workers in favor of capital.
4831 2018-11-23 02:55:32 Stocks na lang bro tapos sabihan moko kasi gusto ko rin maginvest 
4832 2018-11-23 02:54:28 Your info is about 5 years out of date. Solar, wind, geothermal and storage batteries can easily replace fossil fuels now. Then we’ll add wave energy and prosper. Sell all you oil and gas stocks. They are going down fast
4833 2018-11-23 02:52:46 Probably a good time to be buying stocks and investing in general if primary fiscal balance going to zero, inflation being cut in half next year and fx now stabilized. Various deregulation initiatives taking effect

4836 2018-11-23 02:50:52 Hey twitter ban me! You banned @LauraLoomer for no reason! The people have had enough! You allow others to spew hate speach, others to threaten lives but you ban her! No wonder tech stocks are crashing!
4837 2018-11-23 02:50:39 National debt outrageous, housing market going down. Read economic indicators. Stocks all over the place. Like I said take your head out of the sand. I’ve always hated con men. #wake-up
4838 2018-11-23 02:48:17 This is exactly called as paid promotion by media on companies involved in unethical practices that give no stock returns for years together. They pay you and you promote, we understand. But why go bashing Quality stocks? Is it bcause they don't pay you for promoting?
4839 2018-11-23 02:48:14 Feeling Thankful for a family that can have dinner and talk about crypto and pot stocks with no extra volume conversation ( no fights no yelling). And the fact it was a 47yo, 63yo & 87yo having the talk. How cool is that?
4840 2018-11-23 02:46:50 America stands for business nation. If it has a $ come up they not gonna mess up the cash flow and if broken bones, sickness, and people giving up their ghosts is whats generating money, they gonna make sure theyre stocks are protected

Will let you guys know once its onhand. All stocks are delivered and reserved na kasi. Thanks!
4842 2018-11-23 02:45:55 From the people who buy products and services. Once an initial stock offering happens a business doesn’t make any money off the stocks in the secondary market. Too many business take short term efforts because of stock value to enrich executives.
4843 2018-11-23 02:42:54 @jessefelder had 2 podcasts where the same topic came up. What sectors are a contrarian buy. And... Gold stocks didn't come up once.
4844 2018-11-23 02:42:45 For example, I've been watching a few stocks for the past couple of days, and before it reverses, it first goes further down hitting the points where the majority would put their sl and then reversing from there.
4845 2018-11-23 02:41:56 Only traders understand traders. You can’t ever teach someone about stocks if they’re not interested. Just doesn’t work out.
4846 2018-11-23 02:38:13 I bought and added to my long term stocks.
4847 2018-11-23 02:37:25 Sans relancer le débat, le jeu est inconsistant pour d'autres facteurs sujets à changement, Stocks, méchaniques, format etc.

4855 2018-11-23 02:32:40 I’m an off the charts extrovert but the lack of silence at my in-laws’ drives me crazy. The football game is on, with sound, and they’re talking about stocks over it
4856 2018-11-23 02:30:59 And do you do spreads or naked.  I assume naked and hedge w vix calls or short stocks
4857 2018-11-23 02:29:19 Bump stocks...99% of Americans wouldn't know what one was if you put it on the table in front of them, even many gun owners. That's because it's not much of a threat. You have a far greater risk of death from medical mistakes than bump stocks. Maybe docs should focus on that.

4865 2018-11-23 02:25:46 Lo que yo digo es que los especialistas que tomaron la decisión del desplome de esos stocks, no lo tomaron bajo una noticia, seguro se fundamentaron. Y dude si son stocks, y hay una tendencia no tantas personas pueden estar en un error.

4867 2018-11-23 02:24:43 if crypto traders bought and sold stocks, the market would crash just as much. weak hands in this space don’t know a thing about investing. they just jump ship every time stuff goes down.
4868 2018-11-23 02:23:44 Walaaaa :( sabi nila limited stocks lang daw kasi kaya walang tester.

4871 2018-11-23 02:21:04 Once the dust settles & reversal begins, all these stocks have potential to produce excellent returns. I totally agree with you on the time frame part. Accumulating them at few different price points isn't a bad idea in my opinion. Happy Thanksgiving, Larry :-).
4872 2018-11-23 02:20:48 I said it possible the market might  panic. In a bear market good & bad news can still deliver a -ive result on stocks. Just like in a bull market good & bad news can & has resulted in a positive reaction to stocks. Trend is the most important consideration for direction.
4873 2018-11-23 02:18:57 I had same thought, but just checked prices on those same stocks today (the ones that still exist) and all of them are still in a significant loss and most of them an even worse loss.
4874 2018-11-23 02:18:29 It kind of reminds me of the wall street bankers in the 1920's hyping up certain stocks after they had accumulated and then slowly dumping on the public as they fomo'd in.
4875 2018-11-23 02:17:09 Carl what stocks do you like? Excluding ones you’ve loosed money on.
4876 2018-11-23 02:16:48 Strong pick-ups to keep the midfield stocks looking fresh. Smart for a team that basically has every other need covered at this point.

4879 2018-11-23 02:16:02 2/ as for Netflix theyre down but they're up 80% from last year. if anybody's been paying attention for the last 3 to 6 months and as experienced as Soros is it would make sense to dump those stocks. It's not like they we're riding great, he dumped and then it cratered

4887 2018-11-23 02:07:07 It's Thanksgiving, buy a stock and be thankful!  So what if it goes down?  In other countries they don't even HAVE money to. Loose on stocks

4889 2018-11-23 02:05:28 A significant decrease in holiday spending would likely cause a dip in many stocks and some might call it "bad for the economy".

Know what else was "bad for the economy"?

The abolition of slavery.

Our decisions should not be based on appealing to individuals of status.
4890 2018-11-23 02:05:17 Maybe just another coincidence.  You know, like just after 2016 elections in a complete GOP win, stocks rise significantly?
4891 2018-11-23 02:04:39 This shows your knowledge @ImTheDebate Crypto does not move like stocks, nor does it ever climb slowly

-Declined new job offers

4896 2018-11-23 02:01:08 Well the NRA is for gun violence because they will not support any gun control measures, not even ones that we used to have that worked. They wouldn’t support a ban on bump stocks.
4897 2018-11-23 01:59:26 Elections a week ago, stocks drop this week.  True.

Bush, Obama, you, gasoline prices are an extremely poor metric to use for the wellbeing of your country. Its similar to your talk about how stocks have done well. These are metrics you really influenced.
4904 2018-11-23 01:43:11 Kramer says

1. Stocks are collapsing

4907 2018-11-23 01:40:05 He has no idea what factors make oil (or stocks in general) go up or down.  He thinks he’s a player, but he’s not.

4917 2018-11-23 01:26:58 Are they both taxed same ? I've read SPx has a 60/40 short/long term treatment. Btw I think you are doing great with just focus on index, you may find missing on SPx when u focus on other stocks, but I am sure you know that.
4918 2018-11-23 01:26:10 Or just check any of the tech stocks during 1999-2000..many companies don't even exist today..
4919 2018-11-23 01:24:09 I have a tendency to hold stocks atleast for a few years 
4920 2018-11-23 01:23:59 It's not fear, it's a market correction. Stocks were already overvalued (check historic p/e ratios), then they were pushed higher with the tax cuts. It's like giving someone an adrenaline shot, eventually it'll wear off and they'll come crashing down.
4921 2018-11-23 01:22:05 The guns, that's the real estate

4922 2018-11-23 01:21:34 @JustinTrudeau If we concentrate on the DOMESTIC SEAFOOD market,the requirements and local DIRECTION of our indigenous communities for FOOD FISHERIES, then fish stocks will REPLENISH almost IMMEDIATELY. 
Why? 
Because we END THE EXPORT OF WILDLIFE to offshore fish markets, FIRST.

4928 2018-11-23 01:17:33 Although I believe 589 is way out of the question you cant compare it to market cap 20 billion inflow invested got the whole crypto space to 800 billion also this isnt traditional stocks it's the movement of money using an asset which has never been done before
4929 2018-11-23 01:16:33 I know. My stocks have not been doing to well since then. They will just find a way to blame Trump.
4930 2018-11-23 01:15:45 And this is why the stocks have taken a dive the past couple of weeks.....only gonna get worse.  All the gains are now back to even....sad.

4932 2018-11-23 01:13:51 @APompliano it’s time to start collecting cryptocurrency now. Both stocks and bonds have stopped going up. Money managers have started HODLing money. When money starts losing value happens,  #crypto is going to take off to the moon.

4935 2018-11-23 01:10:20 $JCP $XRT Wow, I've told people to stay away from this (hyped) stock forever but hadn't looked at it for months now. Price even surprised me since many other retail stocks had rallied recently but can't say I'd be a buyer on most any of them at this point.

4980 2018-11-23 00:23:41 #Idea #Vodafone #airtel all have collectively removed #Lifetimevalidity to make all users pay more for #Servicevalidity since telecom stocks are falling. They are forcing all people to pay more for their profit. Becareful & don't get scammed with porting.

4984 2018-11-23 00:20:43 I think it is not about socialism at all but because so many rich people make money by buying stocks in healthcare companies.  Healthcare for profit is unheard of in countries that have health care for all.  How about a Fire Dept for Profit?  How does that strike you?

4986 2018-11-23 00:16:58 Watch out for those who are long bitcoin stocks. They probably can get as ugly as Apple and Herbalife freaks.

4992 2018-11-23 00:12:02 The pro-growth moves also shrugged off a 4.4% drop in US October durable goods orders. Tech and energy stocks led the rallies. Action over December will determine whether this is a short-term, corrective rally or the beginning of the regularly observed seasonal lift.
