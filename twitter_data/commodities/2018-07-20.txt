Yo como historiador se que es verdad, ya los historiadores y sociólogos ubican al uribismo como un populismo más de los tantos que se formaron en todos los países latinoamericanos por los efectos económicos del boom de los commodities

42 2018-07-21 19:14:29 I don’t know why FM Dr Thomas Isac is opposing GST council decision to reduce taxes of 18 products Surprising that Kerala is opposing inclusion of crude oil  under GST which will ultimately lead to reduction of price of essential commodities Dr Isac is having a ‘shylock’s mind’

50 2018-07-21 18:19:16 Should this have taken a year?  And even a Gujarat election, before which most other essential commodities were drastically reduced? If they say it's states to blame why credits to the PM alone now who is in the picture?
51 2018-07-21 18:11:37 Yes, Dan...I did notice, but I stay away from commodities
52 2018-07-21 18:02:58 It’s a business cycle decision from my perspective which in general follows  a pattern - 1: Satisfy a need (think dBase in the 80s) 2: Feature war (think Excel and Windows era in general through the 90s) 3: Design war (think Apple) 4: Price war (commodities win on efficiency)
53 2018-07-21 18:02:53 One day in our lifetime we will live in a cashless society...

It will be a tokenized world.

People just don’t know it yet.

59 2018-07-21 17:38:09 Further reduction of GST on essential commodities is welcome. Good decision.

66 2018-07-21 17:23:35 It is not that I am opposing tax reduction. But the important question is on whose consumption commodities, those of the rich or those of the poor are you reducing the taxes? GST has proved to be a bonanza to the rich of India.
67 2018-07-21 17:17:25 I agree some tariff shifting is gonna suck.  But your putting it on one man Trump.  This was something he inherited!  Obama didnt do damn thing cept destroy are econ for 8 years.  commodities been going down like I said least 5 years.. commods always up and down no matter..

70 2018-07-21 16:58:30 I’m so glad none of my bodily fluids are considered commodities. It’s so gross that we think of living creatures as dollar signs to be exploited rather than individuals in their own right. Grow some oats and almonds instead, dairy farmers, your torture juice causes CVD.

84 2018-07-21 16:14:49 Lol, ignorance is a huge problem, reason why some of these commodities are either misused e.h. as fishing nets or window blinds or left unused
85 2018-07-21 16:08:07 I don't think google and other tech companies are trying to get rid of us but they are actively trying to us each persons data for profit.  Essentially, they turn us into a commodity. Commodities don't have rights.

87 2018-07-21 16:05:45 "mehangai" is a relative term --> "Commodities" like Rahul Gandhi, JNU communists, some placard yielding Bollywood artists , fake news media like ndtv, scroll, wire - all became too cheap.   Items like tooth paste and sanitary pads are "more costly" compared to the cheaps.

Look at a commodities chart ignorant one.  Called supply and demand...  Record employment! stock market! Yep
119 2018-07-21 14:29:54 The simplification of return and allowing traders to file quarterly returns below 5 cr turnover will positively reduce compliance. The rate rationalization will substantially reduce the #tax burden for a large number of commodities: @bipin_sapra, Tax Partner,EY #GSTCouncilMeet

122 2018-07-21 14:18:47 You realise you’ve also just defined Capitalism? Doesn’t get much more evil than using human beings as commodities to make a profit. Communism, on paper, beats capitlism. BOTH in practice have severe limitations. Communism has attracted evil. Capitalism actively encourages it.

132 2018-07-21 13:46:33 Let’s be honest, #young people are not queuing up at healthcare facilities to get #condoms!! When we design #HIV #prevention programs and service delivery platforms, we need to make sure commodities are getting to people who need them #WeAreReady #communities4prevention
133 2018-07-21 13:39:01 Considering that police time and infrastructure dollars are limited commodities, allocating them to things that cause more severe injuries seems reasonable. By all objective measures, drivers of 4000lb steel boxes cause the most injuries. But we’re wasting time on scooters.
134 2018-07-21 13:36:21 True, although those "investments" only bring income in a few ways. For securities (stocks, bonds, commodities), it's by other people voluntarily trying to play the same game and losing. Dividends of course come from profits.

I'm unconcerned about the income source.
135 2018-07-21 13:31:53 Me atreví comentar precisamente poque si de lo que hablo, 20 años trabajando con commodities agricolas, solo busca info estas variedades de maiz e informate un poco: Flint, Vadito Blue, Heirloom, Glass Gem etc ni siquiera son variedades nativas de Mexico,
No propagues ignorancia
136 2018-07-21 13:29:12 You are totally wrong. Your article is misleading. Prices of almost all goods/commodities have gone up considerably. Life of consumers will never improve in this country. Please stop such propaganda. People know what is reality.
137 2018-07-21 13:26:38 Invest in a fund that has gold in the fund. Then learn how commodities work. From there open a brokerage account, and jump right in!

Part of Japan & USA FIN WAR against CHINA & the yuan, we are including future TRUMP moves to devalue world OIL & Crush Russia

US not in a position to export NatGas to EU & punish Russia, but world prices for both commodities will be affected
139 2018-07-21 13:22:30 We are great blokes we care about the people we work with and dont treat them like commodities like those lads at Leeds
140 2018-07-21 13:21:49 Fez a gestão da cidade mais rica do país. Se for assim o primeiro governo de Lula foi primoroooooso!! Pq pegou bom ciclo dr alta das commodities.
141 2018-07-21 13:03:43 My shame for my species grows daily!  This is truly heartbreaking.  Dairy is NOT healthy. Please ditch this garbage. There are so many alternatives. Do NOT support such cruelty. Living beings turned into commodities! It is wrong! 
142 2018-07-21 13:03:10 See, don’t be an ethnic chauvinist and I respect you a lot. Dangote and his chronies are one of the destroyers of our country. Don’t bring America narratives into this. Giving monopoly of essential commodities to a business man is a way of giving them  license to be extra-rich .
143 2018-07-21 13:00:41 TRAIN Law funds free College but it also Increase PRICES of Prime Commodities imagine just for one piece of KAMATIS cost 20 pesos.
144 2018-07-21 13:00:27 Saw a dude who had a "Karl Marx" tattoo on one leg (times new roman) and a Cadillac logo on the other. Some commodities are too powerful to be critiqued.
145 2018-07-21 12:58:10 And while I have your attention - I didn't vote for a lie. I know exactly why I wanted out of the eu.

It's an undemocratic protectionist racket for the sole benefit of the communist financiers who use it to ringfence their commodities- us.

Glad I could clear that up for you.
146 2018-07-21 12:55:51 This chart is butter for Gann if you are looking at the 25% 50% and 75% moves. It would be meticulous to do all the equations...I just did it in my head. Read a book of his about trading commodities halfway...Don't@me unless some knowledge is kicked sir.
147 2018-07-21 12:42:33 When comes to receding GST levels, they are cosmetic & no concurrence on bringing fuel prices under GST.  Purpose of GST was a flat tax but government has juggled according to prices of the commodities, a right step but cumbersome for businessmen to use.  #GSTCouncilMeet
148 2018-07-21 12:42:14 So the day Lagos collapses, Nigeria will stop importation? If Government makes it policy that XYZ commodities must come in via portharcourt the companies will say no??  This reason is not valid. Oil companies are still in portharcourt. Restiveness has reduced drastically.
149 2018-07-21 12:41:43 Fair point.  Ag as a whole can win while some commodities struggle with specific countries.  We need to keep pushing for better, rules-based agreements to open up new markets for all commodities including rice.  Thanks for the comment.

151 2018-07-21 12:22:06 In order to ensure uninterrupted supply of agricultural commodities in the context of the ongoing truckers strike, Tamil Nadu has announced that all these products can be transported free of cost through government buses.  @timesofindia
152 2018-07-21 12:21:16 No 4, there has been a commendable performance in the agriculture sector with more focus on export of commodities. Rice & beans importation into the country have gone down by 60%. States like Kebbi 've turned out to be productive & states like Lagos, Ogun & Ebonyi are following..
153 2018-07-21 12:20:48 Russian have declining young population. GDP is totally dependent on volatile commodities, is sightly bigger than Spain and less than Italy in line with Australia, and again economy is owned by Oligarch. Are they punching above their weight again like 70s and 80s ?
154 2018-07-21 12:14:36 Because I doubt there's an all pro burger flipper at Five Guys. Unless that's you???? But NFL players aren't just employees, they're commodities. Merch with their names on it, adverts with them in their team's uniform. They're not the same as you and I.
155 2018-07-21 12:00:20 I thought so too. Underneath his eyes looks dark and drawn but as far as TPTB are concerned the show must go on. Actors are more commodities than human beings to some people
156 2018-07-21 11:57:16 @robinlundberg  CTE is serious.  Football has always been a collision sport. We don't compare NASCAR to demo derby either . So comparison between it and other sports not valid . As long as. The @NFL treats players as a commodities we won't make progress on this ... #truthfully
157 2018-07-21 11:54:38 Completely agree with you on this. Too many animals are bred as more are killed as they are unwanted. They are treated as commodities. Earthlings is a good documentary that highlights some of the industries animals are used, abused & killed in.
158 2018-07-21 11:40:53 It's now a money enterprise and we would be naive to think Trump & co are interested in labeling these commodities as people it's just not on the Horizon.
If they were concerned then they would have gone about this whole affair in a decent humane manner from the start.

160 2018-07-21 11:39:30 Óbvio que abrir o mercado de um país que só produz matéria prima e exporta commodities, com uma baixa industrialização e sem investir em produtos de alto valor que são nas áreas de ciência e tecnologia vai dar certo!

Nem acaba com as poucas indústrias e gera desemprego em massa.

But currency itself? It's a tool, the only morality it had comes from how it's used.
165 2018-07-21 11:10:36 This shell game is the core lie of Capitalism, that the invisible hand if the market will somehow assign fair value to all things as commodities.

Neoliberal economist disdain the 'myth of the barter economy', their cult only sees capital.

A barter economy shouldn't be a myth.
166 2018-07-21 11:05:35 Just stop already. The 10% is even an exaggeration just incase some people are benefitting from it. The free food was a scam, The herdsmen has displaced majority of the farmer and food commodities is at an all time high.
167 2018-07-21 10:56:18 I believe that their will be more opportunity for the many entrepreneurs from various backgrounds in the UK will have opportunity to build new industries and remove reliance on northern eu countries for the industrial commodities we need

174 2018-07-21 09:52:24 That period (2011-2014) when u (may have) criticised Congress was when monumental scams tumbled out of their closet, when there was rampant policy paralysis, highest inflation, costliest commodities (even the daily needed 1s), etc. So U hav done nothing remarkable as a Journo.

182 2018-07-21 08:37:34 Yes that's true. 
Demand compliments satisfaction.
Both commodities provides satisfaction but the former is a versertaile product, which provides more benefit to the society at large.

187 2018-07-21 07:45:19 On the farm side of the equation, the trouble is that China has put punitive tariffs on commodities grown in Trump-friendly states, especially soybeans (a huge export item—tofu). Loss of Chinese sales means a glut of soybeans. Commodity prices fall. So do farm incomes. @KG_ExGop

193 2018-07-21 06:56:06 Farmers can't go to farm reason, the fear of Fulani herdsmen. Food commodities r extremely expensive, reason farmers can't go to farm.

194 2018-07-21 06:53:24 Even here in Vietnam, prices surge high 10 pesos more in php for pork and other commodities are in the same trend. It's a global dilemma. But i don't hear Vietnamese complaining much nor hearing people rant about his matter.
195 2018-07-21 06:38:05 Empire is circulation - of people, commodities, people as commodities, capital, troops, microbes, language, culture, policies, ideologies. That process is embodied in the students I teach, in me, and in the French national team as they stand on the pitch.

200 2018-07-21 05:52:37 The solution is not just exemptions of various commodities to water in the ambush due to the effect of higher compliance which Indian small scale businesses are facing , the solution may be is to leaving more money into the hands of spenders in order to grow the country.
201 2018-07-21 05:46:06 Nonsense. There are price controls on milk, on electricity, on lots of stuff. And yet people still make a good living providing those commodities. Regulation is there to contain fraud and greed so there will be enough for everyone not just the rich. Not complicated.
202 2018-07-21 05:45:10 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa
203 2018-07-21 05:33:28 I feel like somebody once wrote some stuff about this. Like how relations between human beings can often be misperceived as relations between abstract things like money and commodities

Why these essential commodities are still in 28% category ?? #GST

207 2018-07-21 05:17:11 When biz leaders say all is not well with economy, they actually mean only their specific sectors. A trade war is obviously negative for commodities, so...
208 2018-07-21 05:05:09 I really am tired of straight couples looking for queer girls on tinder, we’re not disposable fucking commodities you can just throw away when your man’s done projecting the fact that he wants other pussy
209 2018-07-21 04:46:17 Farmers have highest rate of suicide. Commodities prices down, interest rates up. Farmers are hurting. They voted for Trump. So much winning. Could be related to this.
210 2018-07-21 04:40:29 people are not commodities to be traded on, this is worrying that insurers will utilize this choosing to only insure low-risk people to maximize profit and reduce expenditure leaving high need and high-risk people effectively locked out of coverage and unable to afford treatment
211 2018-07-21 04:32:07 It "chaffs" me that such "husk"y wheat traders cheat at the game of commodities.  That would never happen in the energy trading industry #OOTT
212 2018-07-21 04:27:11 This nonsense be put to an end. They can do prayers at home & not like this causing inconvenience to public.

If we park vehicle for few minutes while picking up essential commodities they fine us exorbitantly.

What are cops doing now? How do they give permission like this?
213 2018-07-21 04:21:09 Fue fácil con el súper ciclo de los commodities ... veamos como se desenvuelven con una crisis entre manos ... y por lo que se ve hasta ahora, no muy bien ...
214 2018-07-21 04:13:08 The deregulatory policies that helped create the financial crisis are rooted in the deregulatory efforts of Phil Gramm and signed by Bill. See Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodities Futures Modernization Act.
215 2018-07-21 03:27:10 Thanks so much for speaking the truth. The summer after I graduated from high school, Dad had started trading on the commodities market. One of my jobs as I worked in the house was to monitor the futures  bean market and report to him. Prices matter. Take care.

217 2018-07-21 03:01:06 I guess you have not seen the commodities market lately
218 2018-07-21 02:56:08 If you view “markets” as the exchange of commodities based on equivalence, utilizing some proxy for labor or utility (currency), then most transactions in life occur outside of markets.

It’s a tricky term.

223 2018-07-21 02:17:00 Actually, if you look at the DVI, there is a strong correlation to a strong dollar means cheaper commodities.  So the Fed Reserve has actually had more of an impact on soybean prices than trade tariffs.  Feel free to DM me, im kind of a big deal.

226 2018-07-21 01:57:29 You do understand commodities right?
227 2018-07-21 01:55:33 Tommy. As we speak were in wave 5, of wave 5, of wave 5, of wave 5 of wave 5 of wave 3!

Yes Tommy, I'm taking about depression, a decades worth. I expect a short-lived new high in s&p then an almighty correction.

Where will the money go? My thesis: commodities, GOLD and BITCOIN
228 2018-07-21 01:45:50 Remember: Trump’s only really interested in people as commodities.
He latches onto anything/one that provides him approbation &YUGE Ratings.
Barr found out she’s a commodity not a friend: her ‘use value’ as commodity ended with close of show.
Focus back on Trump no point gloating
229 2018-07-21 01:42:57 Same here.  Rather not watch anyways.  There just commodities that we are buying low and selling high.  Lol

Yes, prices of commodities are getting higher making the 'poor' unable to buy necessities naturally bcoz resources are misused.

237 2018-07-21 00:14:02 If you draw this opinion out, this is also an economic theory, in terms of argument being conceptualised as politically-effective commodities within an attention economy; nothing that hasn't been said before.
238 2018-07-22 23:56:57 Thomas Crown is different from the others. He is the only one who doesn't look to the masterpieces of art as commodities. The children and the chef of the security treat art as a commodity.

242 2018-07-22 23:48:59 La economía de Estados Unidos está cerca del pleno empleo y las políticas de estímulo fiscal, sumadas al encarecimiento del petróleo y de los commodities, presionan sobre la inflación, obligando a la FED a subir las tasas de interés más rápido que lo previsto
243 2018-07-22 23:48:14 El maíz en EEUU es un insumo industrial porque se usa para el alcohol y eso genera distorsión en el precio. Acá si quieren más rentabilidad deberían agregarle valor a los granos y no venderlos como commodities
244 2018-07-22 23:45:38 the true state of the nation can be heard in the cries of the indigenous people victimized by the military, the families of EJK victims, the fishermen abused by the Chinese, and the families who can barely afford basic commodities. I could go on and on.

246 2018-07-22 23:14:50 Thinking about a ‘steel man’ bull case for Tesla. What does it look like in a world where all cars are EVs (with EV torque), batteries & drive train are commodities and chargers are everywhere? The base case is ‘another car company’. But that’s not the dream.
247 2018-07-22 23:10:36 Hey Paul, do you know where I can read some papers or similars about base metals outlook? I'm looking to learn more about some commodities like Zinc, Copper or Bauxite.

248 2018-07-22 23:01:28 Anyone who thinks there are not going to to be problems if we go to no deal with EU next year, will be in for a huge shock. Get ready for big price rises on commodities we take for granted. All unnecessary but it's the will of the people apparently.  #skypapers.
249 2018-07-22 22:53:28 I think we have to wait to judge the success or otherwise of the China model. I will be amazed if a country misallocating resources on such an epic scale does not have to pay a huge price one day for its empty cities and glut of industrial commodities.

269 2018-07-22 22:38:43 Doesn't bother me at all. We have always had stocks of crude oil and products squirrelled away. Other commodities too, probably. I'd expect no less. Oh, and the EU sponsors the Intervention Board which stores grain etc, but that's OK of course.
270 2018-07-22 22:28:35 You compare salvation with commodities....needs and wants...different priorities...salvation is a must by the way
271 2018-07-22 22:26:14 por que la diferencia del precio de petroleo también se ve reflejada en mayor valor de los derivados importados y por que políticas de inversión y gasto en base a endeudamiento son imposibles de sostener en una economía que no deja de ser exportadora de commodities... digo no
272 2018-07-22 22:21:36 I think youve taken me up wrong, i think small coops are the way to go, but only if they process themselves.I dont see a future in commodities for Ireland, we’re too small scale.We need rare breeds, multispecies grassland, Agroforestry,fruit & nut trees.Mixed farming & new coops.
273 2018-07-22 22:07:47 Lmao. I love that you all presume I’m conservative.  Socialism is at its heart a distribution of wealth.  It is about universal basic things: health care, education, etc that are a right for all.  Not commodities.  But folks. There is a price tag.  Do it responsibly.
274 2018-07-22 22:07:34 Supply and demand! BTC has a very low total supply relative to many commodities and is completely limited!

277 2018-07-22 21:37:53 Eu me pergunto o seguinte: se o Lula for eleito e as commodities não subirem como na primeira vez, ele n vai poder surfar no preço delas de novo e pegar o crédito pra si, nesse caso ele vai assumir que só faz cagada na economia ou vai jogar a culpa pra oposição?

282 2018-07-22 20:59:41 That’s a good explanation. I guess stocks, commodities and bitcoin are the only choices. Seems like banks are creating a monster again.
283 2018-07-22 20:56:48 Toxic beauty standards gotta go. I fail to see how it's good for anyone except for people profiting off women as commodities, but I'm willing to be enlightened if someone wants to give me a valid reason. Beautiful is beautiful at any size.
284 2018-07-22 20:52:52 5. Congress should back money with gold, silver, other commodities, federal government owned lands, etc.  Reducing rate of increase in inflation over time one of best ways to reduce poverty over time and help people have more secure retirements.
285 2018-07-22 20:49:16 Like, are there any commodities unique to the US thatbare not available from Canada, Asia or Europe? I can’t think of any at the moment. I just can’t logically think why any other country would fold when were the aggressor.

287 2018-07-22 20:38:10 There are commodities where that risk doesn't exist. Among others, we are working with nanotech markings on gemstones that allow unique hash for single original stones, traceable even after cutting, polishing etc. @proofofimpact
288 2018-07-22 20:28:56 Fact:  the better the team plays, the higher trade value. This 9 game winning streak has exposed some real commodities the Pirates can give away for more flexibility and fireworks for Labor Day celebrations
289 2018-07-22 20:21:44 I think many people hear the word commodity and think low price ie it’s going to be commoditized, but obviously there are scarce commodities like #bitcoin where the price will go higher as we go up the adoption curve

291 2018-07-22 20:00:28 I'd argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand what's going on - certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be. -- John Burbank
292 2018-07-22 19:47:49 Exactly. Focus on the value-added manufacturing not commodities like steel and aluminum. Engine makers take $1000 of metals and turn it into a $100,000 engine. What business would you like to be in?

296 2018-07-22 19:25:54 Would invoking Polanyi’s idea of land as a fictitious commodity cut the gordian knot here? Real commodities can be held privately, but fictitious commodities must be managed in common via a “radical market”.
297 2018-07-22 19:22:44 Women & girls are seemingly disposable commodities in Africa. East Africa is rife with these harmful/deadly cultural/religious practices endorsed by men (and some very questionable women).
298 2018-07-22 19:21:29 Inequality itself isn’t bad, it’s when the gap widens to the point that the working class cannot afford commodities is when it becomes a problem.
299 2018-07-22 19:21:09 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth
300 2018-07-22 19:20:59 We pay 38.5c/l on petrol, which makes our fuel expensive. It used to be 45c before the reduction earlier in the year, but the issue is that commodities have risen world wide and crude oil is now above $65.
301 2018-07-22 19:18:53 Technical books for commodities and chart analysis
302 2018-07-22 19:17:17 Eso es un insumo industrial, y el insumo que determina el costo. El biodiesel es aceite, un poco de metanol y energía Bajar artificialmente un 25% el precio del aceite es dumping.

309 2018-07-22 18:51:39 Our country is far more than an economic engine. It is a place where Canadians can get on with living safely and well, in exchange for going along with reasonable laws.

311 2018-07-22 18:40:09 Ray that's the correct answer from Wamagaisa. Don't look any further. In fact you can go further and say that applies to all the other highly priced commodities .
312 2018-07-22 18:37:33 Minimum prices also cut several ways. Though on paper they cover a range of commodities, in reality the govt is able to act as a buyer of last resort for only a handful of crops—mainly rice,wheat,cotton and sugarcane—and only in select locations. @NITIAayog @AgriGoI

317 2018-07-22 18:22:17 I’m not sure I understand your point. Are you saying rises in prices of commodities don’t matter or that it’s share prices that were ‘threatened’ by doomsday forecasts?

323 2018-07-22 17:52:09 Sadly true. Such a pity that top athletes become commercial commodities.
324 2018-07-22 17:46:29 Collectibles, commodities, currency, money. All have different aspects. Usage for currencies and commodities make them usage derived. But not great stores of value unless it’s a precious metal.
325 2018-07-22 17:44:07 E.g. If you work hard, shouldn't you gain the full benefits of your labor? Do corporations prize profits or people more? Are the wealth of commodities at Walmart making your life better or making more crap cheaper? If you have the ability, shouldn't you help people in need? 3/
326 2018-07-22 17:43:19 Due to a whole variety of factors not least the price of oil on the commodities market which has absolnothing to do with Brexit.
327 2018-07-22 17:42:19 You are mixing your commodities with share prices. Not the same and another example of doomsday Remain rhetoric.

330 2018-07-22 17:31:59 That's because potatoes are cheap but the tortillas, beef, rice, cheese sauce, sour cream, & corporate partnership w/ @Fritolay they already have are rare & precious commodities. Do you even business bruh? @BeefyCrunch2018

348 2018-07-22 15:40:12 Buechner’s certainly got a way with words, but I think he often romanticizes things. Like here, he assumes a career producing commercials for mundane commodities is not meeting a legit need and therefore not something God would call anyone to. But that’s simply not true.

357 2018-07-22 14:47:21 My company doesn’t do individual stocks right now, but we’re getting back into commodities (oil especially). Hugely unloved sector, significantly cash-generative at current prices, and years of under-investment may well mean supply shortages and soaring prices in near future.

369 2018-07-22 13:45:08 @GST_Council On 21st July it has been resolved  that certain commodities will be exempt from tax. Plz clarify whether tax paid on such goods and being claimed as input tax credit will be forfeited or the dealer can claim refund of the same.
370 2018-07-22 13:44:12 But the wealthy will do ok because they will hedge their wealth by investing outside the U.K. or by betting against the U.K. markets. By using there cash position to buy up reduced values commodities in the U.K.
371 2018-07-22 13:34:42 The UK is not a big enough market to demand a dedicated manafactuering footprint, so any UK based final assembly will still be leverage a EU supplier footprint, and most commodities are not GBP based to saving will be outweigh by the added non tarrif costs.

375 2018-07-22 13:26:07 Interesting advice. I’m assuming that’s because you’re over-indexed on real estate and commodities? 
376 2018-07-22 13:24:10 That no one is denying . Now onion price is less tha 10 rs , whereas its nearly 60 rs at d end of upa era.. this is just example u can spend 40 rs more on petrol if u want. I dont think its around 3 rs higher than 2014... list is long i cannot compare   prices  of all commodities
377 2018-07-22 13:21:06 China is Africa's largest trading partner, so if Chinese-made products are hit with US tariffs, there could be a knock-on effect.

So how will a global trade war affect the continent? And how can Africa overcome the reliance on exporting commodities?

383 2018-07-22 12:56:24 Using blockchain tech for supply chains in specialty commodities (coffee, cacao) was one thing I explored early on. Many good things could come from such a thing—but being able to use that as a branding and selling point was most certainly *not* one of them.

453 2018-07-22 04:01:49 The tax council of India, according to my incomplete understanding, has always helped the commodities be less in cost without an exempt from quality. Other countries sometimes learn from Indias import sensibilities, and maybe from even their local goods production tech.

It started with agri, ssi/ micro units,,  extended to several manufactured items. This aids black money, makes difficult in ensuring msp, GDP calc
467 2018-07-22 02:25:08 O Brasil é fraco em todas as áreas, moeda fraca, estrutura fraca e corrompida e nem no ramo do futebol escapa. Tudo que se faz de errado tem um preço e a conta chegou para clubes brasileiros. Jogadores são commodities e são por um preço e querem ganhar copa do mundo? Difícil!
468 2018-07-22 02:19:16 As pessoas não gostam quando eu digo que jogador brasileiro virou commodities, é impressionante como saem a preço baixo para qualquer lugar. O cara vai pro Egito falem três times famosos do Egito? Isso mostra como o Brasil é fraco em todas as áreas é uma pena, mas, é a realidade.
469 2018-07-22 02:16:38 Who knows where this is going! Time to ponder all the potential unintended consequences. Reduced trade due to higher tariffs is a negative for global economic growth which would have a delationary effect on commodities. Currency wars would be inflationary!

472 2018-07-22 01:43:57 The whole fed  policy  is all rules  for  gentiles and no rules no problems for  jew nationals, meaning  it's  obviously a Jewish  national interest that  eats  up all the  commodities of the  country and  the old  Christian money lays around  like  i like  the  attention? Weird
473 2018-07-22 01:36:33 I don't dispute that we are all treated as commodities by TPTB  ;)   
but the libertarian NAP is based on all humans being treated as individuals rather than as pieces of collectives.
474 2018-07-22 01:26:10 I have seen libertarians tweet about there being "a market for immigration", meaning, I suppose, that they see "those people" as mere commodities?

477 2018-07-22 01:16:49 Also, looming possible trade war between two of the largest economies in the world will tend to do that to commodities.

482 2018-07-22 00:22:38 Mark it has been studied in totality. Findings have been well known for decades while the NFL did not just ignore findings but worked to actively cover them up. Nobody is deamonozing the game more the governing body that sees players as commodities to be used and dispose of.

484 2018-07-22 00:18:25 Basic commodities started to rise their prices because of the Train Law. This law should be abolished. We already have the 12% VAT which is sufficient enough to fund the government projects.I am a taxpayer and people should also do their share in paying their taxes.

532 2018-07-20 20:25:51 This actually ties in perfectly with my last comment about resources and commodities.

Venezuela has the opposite scenario to my point; their economy was based on an abundance of resources (which have been been heavily devalued since 2014) to fund the importation of commodities.
533 2018-07-20 20:24:22 CAD longs will start week off before a pullback. NZD and AUD will see employment data/CPI respectively.  These commodities will get bashed.  Good long setups in these commodities after next week #cad #aud #nzd

It's a pity that we cant even find a public place to discuss our own thoughts on social issues that are directly related to our everyday lives.
The Gov. Sure knows how to shut our mouth! 
535 2018-07-20 20:22:34 Commodities are not resources, commodities are produced from resources.

A country can have an abundance of commodities due to importation, whilst having no resources of their own.

583 2018-07-20 17:06:31 Bitcoin is a decent medium of exchange but not a great store of value. Precious metals are useful as money and commodities. And with a physical limited supply. Becoming more scarce. The prices don’t currently reflect it’s scarcity.
584 2018-07-20 17:05:58 True, but the #Russen can't drink oil and eat gas. They need commodities they can't produce themselves. The got raw materials and resources, and no consumer goods industries worth mentioning.
585 2018-07-20 17:05:21 the reason why there is alot of bare land in kenya is because the government emphasises too much on promoting business while there is simply no commodities to trade .Agricultural production is impossible.manufacturing dead

588 2018-07-20 16:58:55 True, the smart money in commodities bought oil wells and iron ore mines during this period, kicked back, and collected 10% cash + tax writeoffs.
589 2018-07-20 16:52:10 Subjetivo? Yo veo muchas mejoras? No señor, números !! No hay nada subjetivo acerca los numero de la inversión o los precios de los commodities. El subjetivismo dejárselo a Mujica y su mutha que bastante mal le hicieron y hacen al país

Brazil knowingly shipped them rotting beef and only got kicked out for month

597 2018-07-20 16:12:38 This tweet reveals a profound lack of understanding of how commodities work.
598 2018-07-20 16:11:29 Everyone needs to understand that nothing comes for free. Wealth is not actually "created." Wealth is made manifest when we transmogrify one thing into another thing, chiefly when we transform natural resources into useful commodities. - 1/3
599 2018-07-20 16:03:07 Pro tip #todayinonlinedating - saying you’re on the app to “see what’s out there” basically says you see the people you seek as potential partners as commodities. People are not a what. They are a who.
600 2018-07-20 15:57:15 Yet you won't by my meal and then as the strategy to bring forth more revenue upon the commodities, you seize the wall.

Loyalty, honesty, love, respect are some of the qualities that cements friendships. I would like my friends to be like
Resham, Aastad, Smita and  Bhushan.
603 2018-07-20 15:48:39 You’re throwing out a number but do you know the REAL reason for that %? I doubt it. A majority of the US has no clue how ag commodities are traded.  Your tweet just proved it
604 2018-07-20 15:47:29 agree entirely

What if a year from now corn is the big story and acreage switches back?

Commodities are way too damn fickle to toss terms like "never" around
605 2018-07-20 15:47:17 Sir, Good evening. Oil tankers come under essential commodities act, it can move 24/7 on main road. Regards Tr Insp Uppal.
606 2018-07-20 15:46:31 No question, the price has continued down in the trend started 5 years ago. It’s common for supply to increase when items hit bubble levels, like soybeans in 2012. Then a long term price drop often follows with the adding on of supply. And commodities are often volatile in price.

608 2018-07-20 15:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
609 2018-07-20 15:36:00 Since that time people where using commodities to trade and the world was ruled by Kings through authoritarian ,maybe he was given a child of a king as his wife or he was given a position at kings palace ,who knows I'm just guessing since the is no recorded history based on that.
610 2018-07-20 15:32:54 Glad to hear! With small small cap hard commodities NEVER get in too early, always wait for confirmation that they will be a producer. You'll almost always get in at a better price & with less risk. We are there with NPK as they are permitted and the plant will be operating soon.
611 2018-07-20 15:32:23 Pienso que el presidente nuevo debería por fin: 1) Agregarle valor a nuestras exportaciones de commodities, 2) Formalizar la economía premiando a los empresarios con bajas permanentes de impuestos.3) Fomento al emprendimiento y al empoderamiento de las niñas.
612 2018-07-20 15:32:10 This happens a lot, goes back at least 25 years.  They collect tipping fees on the material they're supposed to recycle. And they play the price of recyclables like the Commodities Market.
Get a hold of the contract they have with the municipality you live in.
613 2018-07-20 15:30:21 Se confunde capacidad de consumo con movilidad social, que no la hubo. Cuando el súpericiclo de commodities, no había creación de valor porque el consumo venía apuntalado por gasto masivo del gobierno, políticas de pan para hoy y hambre para mañana, hubo gasto no inversión.
614 2018-07-20 15:26:02 Commodities catch a cold
 
FT’s new daily newsletter on the world of investment
615 2018-07-20 15:25:34 There was inflated value of financial commodities that weren’t actually backed by anything, like a game of over inflated jinga which obama era rules ultimately fix curing booming economy but now those are gone...or do you mean your truth?????
616 2018-07-20 15:23:12 Nothing is wrong with the brt. Look at prices of all commodities IN the world. Let it go for poor people who are on public transport.
617 2018-07-20 15:19:17 Queda claro que la evolución del PBI fue mucho mayor en Uruguay que en Brasil y Argentina, a pesar que todos exportan commodities.

620 2018-07-20 15:12:19 Agricultural commodities make up only a small percentage of the cost of most foods. The cost of the corn in a box of Corn Flakes is about six cents.

623 2018-07-20 15:02:17 You bought fuel @N87/litre, naira was exchanged @N150/$1, cost of commodities was far cheaper then...there were no killings everywhere.. Nigeria was really moving forward under Jonathan
624 2018-07-20 14:58:50 Are Cashner or Cobb possibilities to be dealt at the deadline? They're both down in value, but they're both under team control and not rentals. Both also proven commodities
625 2018-07-20 14:54:59 I don’t see a single market-based indicator that suggests an impending inflation problem. Not Tips, not the curve, not the Dollar, not gold, not commodities, not credit spreads,  or nuthin’.

636 2018-07-20 14:41:47 American farm subsidies are egregiously expensive, harvesting $20 billion a year from taxpayers' pockets. Most of the money goes to big, rich farmers producing staple commodities such as corn and soyabeans in states such as Iowa.
637 2018-07-20 14:39:54 Farmers are losing under Trump’s tariffs.  If China decides to buy commodities from Brazil (top competitor), they likely won’t switch back to USA after we ‘win’ tarriff war.
638 2018-07-20 14:39:37 Para nada de acuerdo. Mirá el PIB de Argentina y Brasil en el período. Efecto arrastre del boom mundial de commodities es innegable. Más te digo: se aumentó gasto corriente en lugar de invertir en infraestructura o hacer fondo anticíclico

What are your thoughts on having a hard commodities basket to peg sound money against? And how would you handle 3rd party actors inflating/deflating value of those commodities?
640 2018-07-20 14:37:10 Hard assets, commodities, tangible items. Debt isn’t even fiat, its pathetic.
641 2018-07-20 14:31:09 America's growing trade war and the resurgent dollar are beginning to affect the global supply chain as commodities approach correction territory. The contagion is beginning to spread. (Bloomberg)
642 2018-07-20 14:26:09 i have positions in commodities and banks and a select others. I do not see an edge. The commodities is a bounce play so far. i have zero confidence based on the price action that it is any kind of bottom. So practically scalping right now. Be nimble

647 2018-07-20 14:08:21 Let’s all say it together.
Politics does not reflect or effect supply/demand in price for commodities, equities and fixed income. It’s just noise.

653 2018-07-20 13:52:21 @stephenfgordon @MikePMoffatt Are prices for commodities actual path dependent rather than free?
654 2018-07-20 13:52:08 The USA is self supporting!  Turn our excess, into commodities, to feed our own less fortunate!
655 2018-07-20 13:51:45 el desplome del cobre se acentua...y mientra sigas tensa la guerra comercial peor para los commodities
656 2018-07-20 13:47:43 Shutting down markets is not helping the industry thrive. Before we know it the Middle East will find sheep els where and turn their back on Australia....Will this have a flow on effect towards the grains industry if relationships a built with other exporters of food commodities?
657 2018-07-20 13:45:27 It's going to get worse Donald. Corporations producing raws and intermediates are seeing signs of reduction in demand. Our global ag supply chain is significantly disrupted and it may be permanent.  Commodities are dropping. The ripple effect will start hitting us next year.
658 2018-07-20 13:32:08 PMLN have not fixed transmission system , reduced the bill defaults? Although we already had wrong energy mix,  you  still based all your projects on coal and LNG which are import commodities , the circular debt is touching 1 trillion despite you cleared 480 billion by loans.
659 2018-07-20 13:30:54 Wise in my opinion Stephen. We cannot be distracted by those not 'on the hunt'. Every second matters and this minute we have pronounced moves in the US$ that is sending shockwaves through commodities and other sectors. We need intel poured straight, not sugar coated.

660 2018-07-20 13:27:43 The market is a front, a front among fronts, a confrontation. Commodities have business with other commodities, these hard-headed spectres have commerce among themselves.

662 2018-07-20 13:23:12 Há controvérsias. Para quem produz commodities, dólar alto favorece. Economia gaúcha exportadora que o diga.
663 2018-07-20 13:20:20 So if were at or close to peak cyclical inflation, as metals and most commodities appear to be indicating, why go long TIPs and pay for embedded inflation protection? I’d prefer to own the longest duration USTs out there for what’s ahead.
664 2018-07-20 13:19:57 Supply and demand dictate world prices on commodities. Cutting supply would raise prices but it’s a tightrope, America isn’t the only place to buy soybeans
665 2018-07-20 13:17:30 You moron. Crop prices are also tied to yield. Record crop production lowers prices  because of surplus. Investors pulled back on commodities during global recession. One thing that helps is exporting surplus. As of today soybean prices dropped to a 9 year low-that’s on you!
666 2018-07-20 13:16:39 The reason NOW for the precipitous decline in the price of soybeans and other commodities is @realDonaldTrump STUPID trade war. NOW he wants to go to the WTO. IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. FIRST GO TO WTO THEN ENACT TARIFFS. Stable genius my ass!
667 2018-07-20 13:16:30 Total BS -- Commodities are supply/demand driven no inherent return except through driving prices higher for consumer through cheap financing by speculators -  tariffs drive prices UP no Down #learneconomics

674 2018-07-20 13:08:58 Authentication innovation comes to mind. So what the Innovator gets a buy-in from securities regulator, another from banking reg, still one more from Commodities regulator (in US), and so forth. That would be inefficient use of resources.
675 2018-07-20 13:08:11 And now if you can think of the #Blockchain as a creator of #Commodities, then everything falls into place; the economics rules which is why I wanted @SUNY professor from @GC_CUNY @paulkrugman to testify on the nature of #Bitcoin and show to show @NYDFS acted unconstitutionally.
676 2018-07-20 13:07:58 Proper socialism wouldn't lead to monetary crises (i.e. 2008), so bailouts wouldnt've been needed. BTW, socialism doesn't mean less commodities (i.e. makeup), it means we can make what we need. First, we house the homeless and feed the hungry. Then we perfect our lip colors. 
677 2018-07-20 13:07:14 Hace rato. Los commodities están en picada, eso habla de una probable deflación. Lo otro es que la FED y el BCE están aumentando las tasas de interés, por lo que para los gobiernos y personas es más caro pedir créditos.
678 2018-07-20 13:05:36 There are other ways they could respond - restrict exports of some commodities such as REE’s as happened in 2012
679 2018-07-20 13:01:27 It's crazy, it's almost like you're an amazing talent and one of the hottest commodities in the biz right now or something.
680 2018-07-20 13:00:03 Get long commodities here
681 2018-07-20 12:51:58 I have always associated Nakumatt with quality commodities.And if there was a time i bought the idea of Kenya's middle class being on the upsurge is when Nakumatt was in business.
682 2018-07-20 12:48:08 I'm not aware of any research strongly supporting that. I don't think it's accurate to say stocks or commodities "hedge" inflation, given how much more volatile they are.

696 2018-07-20 11:53:26 Fact of it is players are commodities, calling it a Market is probably the most apt analogy to the point were players performances are reflected in their 'stock' going up or down. Business and sport are completely intertwined since the £margins went through the roof.

699 2018-07-20 11:41:15 Our children are not commodities and are not pawns for any Gov't agency. No way should they ever, under any circumstance, be used as spies, what the Hell is the matter with this country? Its paranoia is becoming worse than that of the US. Enough we need moderacy back in politics.
700 2018-07-20 11:41:01 We're partially to blame, in a market where there is unwarranted inflation and high demand, the cost of basic commodities are now much more than necessary..
701 2018-07-20 11:32:13 So should I try to sell the house now, and be paid in sinking pounds, or wait until after Brexit when I can be paid in increasingly valuable commodities like tea bags and potatoes?

702 2018-07-20 11:29:42 How do Crude, Wheat, and other commodities act when the ratio turns around? Are there any fundamental rules that can be repeated?

704 2018-07-20 11:07:46 @JoeSquawk Don't the markets drop & rise all the time? Ask your writers that when Pres Trump does not speak & the market or commodities drop, who are they going to blame like they did for yesterday's drop?
705 2018-07-20 11:07:13 @SquawkCNBC Don't the markets drop & rise all the time? Your  writers should know this & that when Pres Trump does not speak & the market or commodities drop, who are they going to blame like they did for yesterday's drop?

720 2018-07-20 09:08:33 The classic comparison is food, water and electricity as commodities. Not many companies build windparks and wells or have salad farms, but still are doing great. On the other hand there is this off-the-grid movement...

738 2018-07-20 06:56:02 It’s not pathetic, it’s the fulfilment of a sinister plan to deprive voters of even basic commodities through economic policy that strips them of opportunities so that they are grateful when they are given said basics in exchange for a vote. Treat them mean, keep them keen.
