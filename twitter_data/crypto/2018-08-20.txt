1 2018-08-20 23:59:40 ねくさん、ありがとうございます！実は高金利通貨自体やめてしまおうか迷ってました。下落幅をどこに想定するかで戦略が全くかわってきますよね。大いに参考にさせていただきます！
2 2018-08-20 23:59:25 Interesting article. I found trading crypto to be more profitable than mining. You can buy a Z9 and make maybe $50 a day. Takes a few months to pay for itself.
3 2018-08-20 23:59:23 Wtf? even my fixed tweet is a +1month old BTC price projection. There are many other calls like the possibly currently forming IHS or betting my account on btc holding 5.8k. If they turn out to be bad calls I can accept it publicly,which is What am suggesting @Crypto_Macro to do
4 2018-08-20 23:59:18 Hopefully! Waiting to buy back. 
5 2018-08-20 23:59:10 Slide that account this way
6 2018-08-20 23:59:09 Even More bullish on 5800 now?
7 2018-08-20 23:59:03 I don’t just hold XRP. I also hold BTC and many other crypto. I want all to succeed, not just XRP. I think it’s fair to say everyone in crypto space want to see their coin at #1, not just XRP. If you really think BTC will be #1 forever then I think you are also delusional.

13 2018-08-20 23:57:49 I had a short at the top of the pole at $6,513. I closed it at $6,250 and went long. However, I had to escape slightly above it on the bounce after we got another leg down to breach $6,250. Momentum is def with the bears. Good call!

Luv you to rektness..

Im out!
38 2018-08-20 23:56:30 俺は共感したぞw
39 2018-08-20 23:56:25 It's a brilliant idea really.  It would force people to learn about how to accumulate and spend crypto.  Fck waiting for mass adaptation...Let's force it.  There's potholes a plenty up here.
40 2018-08-20 23:55:55 Only positive thing I see going for BTC right now is mass adoption, otherwise isn’t it just a crude, less than ideal payment option ? There are plenty of coins out now that have learned from BTC mistakes that I think will pave the way for the future of crypto 
41 2018-08-20 23:55:39 Huh? I'm pretty sure both Alex and I have made money in the bear market and are up in USD value. No sensitivity here.

51 2018-08-20 23:54:20 Thinking about running a fortnite crypto tournament. This would actually be super fun for this community after all of the shit we’ve been through together. I can attempt to find a sponsor and have a pretty decent prize pool. Who would be down? Would love to make this a reality.
52 2018-08-20 23:54:14 無意味な煽りタイトル、好き(*´ω｀*)
53 2018-08-20 23:54:13 Yeah... They realize they don't have crypto miners buying all the inventory now? They aren't going to sell near what they think...

58 2018-08-20 23:53:33 I suppose this bear market triggered all this sensitivity in people. Calm down, just because I am saying it was a bad move to call the crypto apocalypse due to this ETF decission Doesn’t mean I don’t respect him as a trader and human being.

66 2018-08-20 23:52:34 No margin or leverage... GL selling this to the crypto fan base. They have no idea what this even means.
67 2018-08-20 23:52:22 I totally get it and I understand your point completely. If people want to give their own TRX away then go ahead but I'm not. I guess I'm being selfish but making rich people richer isnt my thing. I like to make rich people poorer. Sorry

79 2018-08-20 23:51:10 Would you say it’s cause by crypto being down ?
80 2018-08-20 23:50:46 Not a shill, look into what DigiByte is doing in Venezuela, 100% going to charity to help actual people who legit need the help not make 100 million last year
81 2018-08-20 23:50:33 If 300million is a drop in the bucket, how is this bullish news?
82 2018-08-20 23:50:11 Potential 10x+ coins from here in my opinion:
$PAY, $DIVIx, $TRST (Given listed on a decent exchange), $DADI, $DAT, $XSN .  Note it will take a very longgg time for that to happen, when the bulls return.  Whats your pick?

85 2018-08-20 23:49:51 I was more trying to comment along the lines how the crypto mining had literally hijacked the GPU market the last couple of years. Indirectly.  Even Nvidia had to come out and make a statement.  It was a side effect, because miners would buy them up.

117 2018-08-20 23:46:17 そっちはオーガーだな。賭け事と保険を綯い交ぜにした実験トークンだ。来年の作物は今年より豊作かどうかなど、投票して賭けていく。農家は凶作に賭け続けるだけで、勝っても負けても美味しいとこ取りになる。リスクを分散できる優れものだ。予測市場なので凶作予想なら素直に畑を休ませるのも良いぞ。
118 2018-08-20 23:46:14 Coinbase is way behind its only added 5 coins in like 3+ years? WTF. If it wasn’t one of the only gateways from fiat to crypto nobody would use it
119 2018-08-20 23:46:03 would be ironic if #Ethereum never recovering is what ends up bringing down the entire crypto market along with bitcoin. ICO’s pumped it last year and dumped it this year.
120 2018-08-20 23:45:57 1900 bucks for a GPU??? And that before the crypto assholes gobble them all up and drive the price even further.

132 2018-08-20 23:43:05 Bashing #OperationTRONStorm? Lol what a dummy. Yeah let’s talk shit on a community driven initiative to further our goals. Blegh. Who needs him.
133 2018-08-20 23:42:58 If you been reading my thread people are giving me shit about this donation shit to produce mass adoption. Exactly you’re proving my point Tron doesn’t need it.
134 2018-08-20 23:42:58 Thank you!
135 2018-08-20 23:42:46 No you are not reading this wrong. I have a Discord channel that i post educational information on trading and it helps newcomers understand why and when we take a trade. Its only $10 per month. I made it affordable so everyone can learn and I dont  have to put up with trolls.
136 2018-08-20 23:42:43 Blocked that unintelligent Human..
137 2018-08-20 23:42:26 Being in crypto is a near full time job, proving that all money is earned.  Never let anyone say it’s a scam or a ponzi for easy money because there is nothing easy about holding XRP for the last 12 months!  But it sure is exciting! #xrp #XRPCommunity #xrpthestandard
138 2018-08-20 23:42:17 the short is that neither take constructive criticism very well if we are being honest and transparent
139 2018-08-20 23:42:01 I'm not totally sold on tipping as a standalone: as the only way to react to a post. Forced tipping is one of the most bullshit parts of culture. In $crypto it drives insular circle jerks to pump network-usage stats. It's shit-tinged fluff.

145 2018-08-20 23:41:00 And lots of things werent in the plan, including the bugs and most of the features added since Satoshi left. Yet BTC is still performing its primary function of being a trustless way to transfer wealth, while BCH withers on the vine.
146 2018-08-20 23:40:52 buying thousands of #btc and sending them to bitmex to xleverage. thats the strategy imo... lets see what happens. Personally i want to see that shorts get REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

150 2018-08-20 23:39:57 I feed off of it too  just tired seeing people getting scammed. Idgaf anymore. Ima be aggressive!!!
151 2018-08-20 23:39:57 He's bitching about people seeding 50 TRX, the equivalent of a whopping $1

153 2018-08-20 23:39:41 Only US dollar is safe investment. Instead of a rapid loss, you are guaranteed at least a 2.5% loss every year. If you don’t like it then soldiers with automatic weapons and tanks will show up at your door along with Krugman and Roubini and tell you that you have to like it.

155 2018-08-20 23:39:35 I can't follow what his point is. How are you "pocketing" anything that goes direct to the artists?
156 2018-08-20 23:39:34 Jahajaj... You get shrats from cheese?.

Poor soul.. How do you deal with pizza?
157 2018-08-20 23:39:30 Perhaps it does what you want it to do. I'm not arguing that. But to say it is actually bitcoin is ignorance at best, a straight up lie in the middle, or propaganda from an enemy of bitcoin at worst.
158 2018-08-20 23:39:23 How you build a crypto mining computer but ask me to fix it lmao
159 2018-08-20 23:39:20 You really have an high opinion of yourself dont you? What the hell makes you think that we think your ruining #Tron adoption? #Tron is a global movement for the people. Who is @Crypto_Vino
Vino Vino  who the fck is Vino
160 2018-08-20 23:39:19 I agree w/ both of you.. If we're gonna send 50 $TRX to celebs, we should send it to celebs who mentioned crypto publicly or in their artwork like @BigSean @aplusk @Nas @iamjamiefoxx @MikeTyson @FloydMayweather @donaldglover @thegame but let's not tear each other down. #TRON #TRX
161 2018-08-20 23:39:11 We are way too underrated.
162 2018-08-20 23:39:10 Hey man not everyone in the crypto world is going to make the right decisions, for every winner there are at least 10 losers. Thank you for being one of those who are willing to take an "L" so the rest of us #tron supporters can win. +5 Dislike @GoSeedit

165 2018-08-20 23:39:04 I have a section where I will be post when I go in on a trade and when I exit. But I wont be sending a text message telling you to buy and sell. This is more educational. I will post the chart explaining why I went in and why I came out of the trade so you can learn for yourself.
166 2018-08-20 23:39:01 crypto is dead. the only people who don’t know it are still on crypto twitter scalping the margins ever.

182 2018-08-20 23:37:04 It doesn't matter what the situation of the market is, you should be prepared. Bear market? You should have spare cash to buy the dips.. bull market? you should be paying attention to when to exit.. bought in already? Do some research while you sit around.. #crypto

190 2018-08-20 23:35:16 A lot funds are not allowed to buy physical and ETNs as financial assets have tax advantages over physical. Factors like this is what cryptobugs miss.

192 2018-08-20 23:34:39 Finally that's the fall I'm looking for in #bitcoin but will it keep falling or stall again? Stop stalling crypto manipulators. I know you want a bullish September Lets see what it looks like tomorrow. #cryptos #altcoins #btc $btc
193 2018-08-20 23:34:29 More than that. Steal articles from people, tweets, etc. just something I’ve been monitoring. The seed it shit got me going. And you see the end result lmao
194 2018-08-20 23:34:27 I can’t believe I just found this. Nocoiner Twitter is the most useless thing I’ve ever seen.
195 2018-08-20 23:33:35 When you are new just watch and learn and don't buy because some one said that. Only buy when you know and understand why to buy there. Otherwise you will lose a lot of money
196 2018-08-20 23:33:32 (crypto gets 4words or less)Monero[XMR]=Private digital cash
197 2018-08-20 23:33:27 if i was running a crypto exchange i would just short the entire market and let it bleed out. i kind of think this what the big players are doing. there not even interested in seeing crypto used for anything. it’s all a game to rake in money. kind of like a casino.
198 2018-08-20 23:33:22 In that particular scenario I think Bitcoin is the best. But what about custom regulations when entering a country with crypto?
199 2018-08-20 23:33:21 Thank you 
200 2018-08-20 23:33:20 Thought you knew everything.... you make enough noise.

206 2018-08-20 23:32:51 I will soon begin a new YouTube series taking an in depth look at various crypto projects.

Are there any projects that anyone recommends for me to take a look at?
207 2018-08-20 23:32:37 Im also not negatively talking about xrp just the fact of the holders begging and praying it surpass bitcoin and be the only working crypto. Remember as you say. Diversity. They can all succeed equally together. Im sure you like some pizza hut and maybe some dominoes both succeed
208 2018-08-20 23:32:34 I have a friend who will dip a banana in the jar and get little bits of banana stuck in the peanut butter. Now that's unacceptable
209 2018-08-20 23:32:31 Stop spreading misinformation, as it is today $XRP is legally a crypto currency. The courts will decide on this issue not you or me.
210 2018-08-20 23:32:29 He didn’t block me but we don’t follow each other.
211 2018-08-20 23:32:18 I think so many people in the USA who had no idea about Bitcoin & Blockchain got FOMO in Sept-Dec ; they took no time to learn jack sh*t about crypto & got burned. Then Tax issues are so complicated no one even knows what to do. Now they have scared off friend w/ their stories ..
212 2018-08-20 23:32:10 Intelligent buyers are all waiting for lower prices...
213 2018-08-20 23:32:06 Market heading lower again atm, levels of support im watching;

6254 .5 fib
6161 .618 fib 
6028 .786 fib 

Still need to break above 6648 to get some upside 

#bitcoin #btcusd #Blockchain #crypto #cryptocurrency
214 2018-08-20 23:32:01 now this can always go lower below the gap, but the gap gives us a target to reach, is this correct?
215 2018-08-20 23:31:56 Liv'n the dream bro!
216 2018-08-20 23:31:56 that's when you know you are dreaming

220 2018-08-20 23:31:35 Seems like its more complex in practice. As for the anti financialization folks... 

If I own crypto - why can't I lend it? That is all we are talking about. The ability to more fully monetize my assets. All the other stuff is just mechanics & accounting. This will be figured out
221 2018-08-20 23:31:34 @joerogan you seen this shit?
222 2018-08-20 23:31:33 Relax
223 2018-08-20 23:31:21 I've been intrigued watching these gaps that you call being filled over the past few months...have the gaps always been present, I was of the impression, although likely incorrectly that the #crypto market didn't form these gaps due to 24hr market? Is it spikes that cause them?
224 2018-08-20 23:31:16 hate to say it but the real money in crypto is no longer holding or trading cryptocurrencies. it’s opening an crypto exchange where you can dupe others into buying high and selling low all the way to zero.

267 2018-08-20 23:27:27 Hey man I’m all for traders trying to make money trading these tokens back and forth. But the more of these tokens we have pump and dump, the more this entire crypto market gets tarnished. We need to list tokens that have real use cases which are being demonstrated today.
268 2018-08-20 23:27:03 @Crypto_Bitlord
269 2018-08-20 23:27:02 What specifically in the chart gives you evidence that this is accumulation rather than distribution? It's obvious after the fact but as a professional Wackoffian I'd like to hear what you are looking to for clues

291 2018-08-20 23:23:18 A couple hundred dollar move tells you close to zero about the future though.
292 2018-08-20 23:23:11 I have a microdick. thought that was the in thing now.

298 2018-08-20 23:22:05 Except the weekly close was bearish then we dumped the next day. And a couple hundred dollar move when traded with leverage, like many are on mex, can be easy money.

457 2018-08-20 23:00:44 As soon as you introduce the requirement of Human trust, it's useless. We don't know you, and even if we did, the whole concept of crypto and blockchain is for this exact reason.
458 2018-08-20 23:00:41 True but the price is linked to the speculation of how well the company is performing. In both respects. Telsas share price dropped just because Musk said something negative. If that doesn't sound like the crypto markets what does.

506 2018-08-20 22:55:38 Not too much Venezuelans hold btc. But certainly much more in comparison to other countries. Because it allows us to scape from hyperinflation. The dictatorship now released more oppression to the national economy. Next months will be crucial for us

516 2018-08-20 22:54:01 overall I think more powerful cards in the hands of consumers == a good thing. but I also don't see crypto going anywhere.

523 2018-08-20 22:52:48 Cryptocurrency shouldn't require rocket science to use, with SIDERA wearable devices, everyone can easily store, transact, and use crypto.

@SideraBC
524 2018-08-20 22:52:46 I can store my USD in USD (100% safe) , no need to "safely" store my USD in a hypothetically "stable" crypto.
525 2018-08-20 22:52:42 I think looking back on the crypto "boom" it will be seen as mostly beneficial. Expensive cards being re-used and sold for less because the digital gold rush said everyone can make money if you just drop $10k on cards! And then those cards have to go somewhere.

547 2018-08-20 22:48:50 A big thesis currently undervalued in the crypto space is exchanging value over internet with just a link. Using crypto to protect and transact value can bring out a lot more than what we are seeing now.

627 2018-08-20 22:40:27 Short term trading is extremely hard and for most best avoided. Thing with crypto is that due to the lack of liquidity and usage backstop dumps can go on and on and on ... and on and on and on.

632 2018-08-20 22:39:52 When I tell some people around me I am into crypto the first thing they think is I'm into Bitcoin. Then I ask them, what else they know about cryptocurrencies? and I get told blockchain. I ask again what else do you know? Silence. The masses have no clue...but they will one day.

637 2018-08-20 22:39:12 It was all fun, no harm done at all.

But for her, just the fact that I'm DMing sone chick with an avi was weird as fuck.

639 2018-08-20 22:38:47 This trading is not serious ...crypto one ....no one knows how many coins an exchange holds , and with limited supply , it is the only thing that can be count as FAIR .

649 2018-08-20 22:37:43 The person who has no idea about crypto is the one thinks giving miners/node hosts ETH as gas fees will make ETH POS based. and again, nobody said they were solid or not as a foundation. I’ve been to their shanghai office multiple times, this thread was simply a discussion.

654 2018-08-20 22:37:02 It’s SAD how some influencers feel the need to bash others in order to justify themselves. It makes them look so insecure. 

If your content is good it should speak for itself. News, interviews, tech, TA, reviews: I appreciate ALL content that helps spread awareness for crypto 
655 2018-08-20 22:37:02 If only that were a dream...
656 2018-08-20 22:36:57 You are right.BCH is not the real BTC.  BCH follows the WP rules. Traders do not mind about the WP.  They want to make money.  Blockstream pays trolls to lie about the Bitcoin protocol. If they don't pay you,  you are a loser spreading lies for nothing.

668 2018-08-20 22:34:02 Maybe to trap more shorts. Would be sick if they short squeeze from here, or after moving price a little lower.
669 2018-08-20 22:33:59 Yeah I could understand just wanting a cheaper price but rooting for it’s demise is clearly a wasted effort. Crypto isn’t going anywhere so discussing price movements makes more sense than if it will live or not.

678 2018-08-20 22:32:45 What is the determining factor for which crypto currencies you add?
679 2018-08-20 22:32:43 The impetus isn't so much inflation as negative real yields. Replace  those neg. yields with positive yield and people will replace monetary  base from bank m2 to crypto-backed m3. Thus buoying price.

683 2018-08-20 22:32:22 Big dump on crypto. $ETH -7% in 15 minutes. In my book a short term trader who was long should have closed before the dump e.g. $BTC above 6400 and $ETH above 280. Matter of time frame of course.

697 2018-08-20 22:31:10 I think it’s one thing to be bearish short term, but people around here are generally rooting for the demise of crypto. Seems like a waste of time
698 2018-08-20 22:31:08 Correct, this is why we need decentralized banking with swaps. Let people park in synthetic cash, then we get the real adoption engine.
699 2018-08-20 22:30:46 if you're broke i hope you're working hard, because crypto investments are about to give you 100x'es again on the next cycle

If you're lucky and the bullrun doesn't start for another 10-12 months, a couple grand could turn into a couple 100k real quick

740 2018-08-20 22:25:26 2/ when I begged friends to buy crypto a couple years ago I said, put 5% of your investable assets in.  I think you’ll 10x your money in 2 years but might lose the whole investment.  As 5% of their investable assets, missing the 10x hurts way more than losing the full investment.

746 2018-08-20 22:23:48 Half-agree.  Crypto assets are like call options (or early stage VC) and should be sized appropriately.  It makes total sense to focus on potential 10x upside (and potential total loss) so long as you’re sizing things appropriately.

763 2018-08-20 22:22:40 This is definitely emerging as a concept - that it will take real usage to drive the next big bull market....would be very healthy if it comes to pass.

767 2018-08-20 22:22:03 In my imagination, @antiprosynth is a secret vigilante whose full-time job is to watch over Crypto-Twitter for people trashtalking #Ethereum.

Very bullish on a $ETH bounce up to at least $370 in the next 8 weeks. 

Wait for daily trendline break for a safe setup
875 2018-08-20 22:09:01 Not quite, crypto faces two hurdles. Anonymity because it results in siloed services and centralised compliance and institutional reporting as it's the banks only barrier to adoption. CRDZ_io addressed both without sacrificing decentralization or privacy, it's NOT impossible
876 2018-08-20 22:09:00 “I think the important insight into the nature of money is that money is a form of communication. At its very basic level, money isn’t value. Money represents an abstraction of value; it’s a way of communicating value. It’s a language.”

895 2018-08-20 22:06:40 Not calling my boss to say I won’t ever return
896 2018-08-20 22:06:32 Crypto is a Ponzi scheme.
897 2018-08-20 22:06:30 The problem is : none of the crypto exchanges are using real coins...........with all those laverages, 10x 100x ......crypto become same as forex ........If ....IF ...there is a rule.....
898 2018-08-20 22:06:03 Donate them to the homeless they could use them  better then them collecting dust.
899 2018-08-20 22:05:58 Thanks for calling me “man”, I’m flattered . Even for the cost of that Ferrari, you could buy a pretty nice BOAT. And then you’d have a new way of life! Not sure why everyone is so obsessed with cars, when you can barely enjoy them on roads with potholes and speed limits 
900 2018-08-20 22:05:55 I can’t stop laughing about the crypto currency thing. It’s like telling an Amish guy he has to drive a much smaller buggy but the inclusion of a fish tank will offset the change.

You are calling it a shitcoin because you dont know shit about it clearly.  For there to be a winner the market needs idiots like you!

965 2018-08-20 21:58:42 Two days ago, I thought about taking a small break from crypto. Then I opened Token Economy today and fell into the rabbit hole once again. The pace at which this space develops is c-r-a-z-y..
966 2018-08-20 21:58:40 Well, for example, i bought into NEO at 0.01 btc a few months ago, thinking that it'd be better to hold crypto in NEO because of the passive GAS.
Or, i bought into DGB at 540 sats a few weeks ago, after making some sats with the swings between 500ish sats and 600ish sats.

1013 2018-08-20 21:51:47 We call it adoption
1014 2018-08-20 21:51:42 Beyond speculation. Current mining programs aren’t geared towards this new architecture. I think the new cards will have 20-30% better hashrates but some of the increased hash will be offset by the increased power consumption. Wait until mining programs update.

1043 2018-08-20 21:47:54 I’ve been tying @I_Am_ICT‘s SMT technique to crypto over the past month or so. Still going thru trial and error leaving out hindsight. But evidence is definitely there...
1044 2018-08-20 21:47:36 Really? Not even those that sold when it was $8?  I hold a bag of $vet, and always will.
1045 2018-08-20 21:47:35 During the gold rush the people that were making the most money were the ones selling maps and shovels. The true millionaires in Crypto are the ones building exchanges, developing coins, etc. Besides trading, there are plenty of ways to making money with Blockchain and Crypto.
1046 2018-08-20 21:47:19 I know  hopefully Tillie will be ok tomorrow, she has to have X-rays and a biopsy done
1047 2018-08-20 21:47:16 Original  + 15% if you want crypto from me friend.
1048 2018-08-20 21:47:01 The UK government has so far not delivered anything of the sort, certainly not while you let that charlatan crypto-fascist Rees-Mogg wreck the economy for the benefit of his hedge fund pals. Just clear off.

1051 2018-08-20 21:46:36 The goal is trust minimization yet a large part of crypto is figuring out who to trust, including yourself. Taking even the most informed opinions with a grain of salt & adjusting for bias.
1052 2018-08-20 21:46:34 Most wise
1053 2018-08-20 21:46:28 This bot will just got door to door with a Binance ref link, that’s all.
1054 2018-08-20 21:46:19 You say its all tied to you're phone

I'm I suppose to borrow someones phone?

What if I drop my phone and it beaks,  what if it gets stolen

If you rely on your "wallet" (phone) as the only source of payment method , you're screwed 

There has to be a better way to use crypto

1062 2018-08-20 21:45:37 Interesting to hear what you think will happen to your country within the next 3 years? Venezuela is undergoing collapse, this gives opportunity for great change, maybe a more direct-democracy, a decentralized system with the aid of crypto.

1072 2018-08-20 21:44:03 You thinking like a crypto trader

1078 2018-08-20 21:42:55 On Crypto Twitter this vote was always going to be skewed 
1079 2018-08-20 21:42:43 Not only it’s not a good way to stabilize the price, it also introduces other issues. Not using a twin token model could still “solve” the problem that ONT & VET are trying to solve. I’ll write a post about it later when free.... again, this tweet was not meant to be offensive.
1080 2018-08-20 21:42:38 Y quien va a usar Petro en Venezuela? Los crypto monedas se hace de manera digital y no todos tienen un telefono, ni computadora ni internet. Además que casi ningun lugar quiere vender ese Petro.

1097 2018-08-20 21:40:19 It's funny to me people love a project or coin/token and then when they get burned on it and the price falls, it's automatically a shit coin to them. Luckily there's opportunity for forgiveness in the crypto market. HODL what you got if you believe in it and let it ride.

1210 2018-08-20 21:24:33 Welnee, dat zeiden ze 4-5 jaar geleden ook al, de echte hausse gaat rond 2020 komen als het IOT massaal wordt. De combi IOT en crypto gaat geen goud worden maar diamant of nog duurder en gekker.

Over een paar jaar gaat het over duizenden miljarden. De vraag is welke het gaan overleven en de norm worden.

1246 2018-08-20 21:20:48 The only people that didn't do well from crypto are the late adopters that jumped in at the end of last year to now. Everyone before that was making money regardless of how astute an investor they were. So, sure if you jump for short term gains only - you're on a dangerous path.

1280 2018-08-20 21:16:00 No mention of tradable tokens, indeed.
I'm just too used to read Crypto Twitter where it's all about trading and any mention of "blockchain" adoption is used as a bullish indicator.
1281 2018-08-20 21:15:53 Pretty much my point, it's just common sense, especially when you gambled all your life on it and even got into deep dept. I don't even get what these guys issue here is. The trader/investor distinction is made up by hodlers/bagholders. Investors can risk manage too.
1282 2018-08-20 21:15:48 No I just like posting uber bullish tweets with the hopes that one day I can look back and say “told you so”

1304 2018-08-20 21:12:17 I am new to trading crypto as of this year. That said I've been using TA and FA in real world markets to help my advisor build a pretty nice little portfolio by finding under valued stocks that should bounce back. Once they do we take some profits and start again.

1334 2018-08-20 21:08:38 Can’t even express enough how excited I am for Xrapid to go live. Milestone first crypto with actual use!
1335 2018-08-20 21:08:36 Transparency on hidden fees, charges, price upon purchases. Example, main page has price, but when selecting to buy it increases, every time every crypto.  Why is this?
1336 2018-08-20 21:08:23 Every day The number of users who want to invest in ICO is increasing and ICO is one of the best ways to invest. Immediately join. #MILC #Blockchain #Crypto #Cryptocurrencies #ICO
1337 2018-08-20 21:08:20 外国へ寄付しようとユニセフにお金を支払って事務処理してなんやかんや〜だと現地へお金が届くのはどれくらいかかるんだろ？

こういう事もXRPで送金って形で寄付できたら現地へ一瞬で届くね！
1338 2018-08-20 21:08:18 Salut @Phil_RX tu peux préciser ton post car dans le monde de la crypto on est beaucoup à être de près ou de loin exposé à tether. Tu penses qu’il faut liquider ses USDT et tout sortir de Bitfinex (qui est lié à Tether)? Merci pour tout 
1339 2018-08-20 21:08:05 My trading resolution in Aug 2018:
1. Keeps the weekly perspective. 
2. LT is #bearish,Buy pyramid, at least 3 stages. sell at once.
3.took a hit when correlation diverge. Analyzing #btc and trading #alt/#xrp is a dangerous play. 
4. Stocks is the rule. #crypto is the exception.

1341 2018-08-20 21:07:53 It’s nuts! These new ones were only announced today and the cheapest top end card is now £1049.99. Crypto had a lot to do with prices and availability last year and I suppose it’ll be interesting to see what the level of demand is for these new cards. #kidneyforsale
1342 2018-08-20 21:07:47 Kanye, please look into the crypto #XRP and #Ripple.

If you can, tweet about it. You will make us and yourself richer. Not in money alone, but in innovations and moving forward.
1343 2018-08-20 21:07:37 I'm glad to see such a promising project @records_keeper . I think that in the near future I will see an unprecedented growth of this project, 
I recommend everyone to join us - this is a strong team of developers. I'm interested to be here.  #Crypto #recordskeeper
1344 2018-08-20 21:07:35 That means you let go of $RVT , $SMART and some $VERI .... is okay bro... just wink if i was right....

But once more, i hope your still mining $ZCL for the upcoming $ANON / $ZCL fork, maybe @JBTheCryptoKing will be down for an interview
1345 2018-08-20 21:07:25 So are you a trader? When did you join crypto?
1346 2018-08-20 21:07:14 Hmm they were not that difficult of questions which by the way you did not answer. And I’ve made no assumptions only questioned the legitimacy of your statements. I’ve lived there and you sir are simply absent of facts or the reality of Venezuelans and their situation.

1354 2018-08-20 21:05:41 The irony of 2.0 and 3.0 crypto is that while banks and those not in the know struggle to try and patent opensource 'blockchain' technology, the real development is moving past it. Unnecessary artificial bloating and asic arms races are centralizing blockchains. Distributedledger
1355 2018-08-20 21:05:30 An OTC trader in China ran away with over 10 mil worth of Fiat and crypto, the community here has put together over 1 mil yuan as reward for tracking him down...Any takers? Available identifying information upon requested.

1425 2018-08-20 20:58:36 - $BTC ranging, uncertainty
- CT is bearish and fears zero
- CT also hopiumish for a bull run
- 23rd August the latest narrative in play
- Crypto not doing much last few days

What can this mean? Do nothing probably. Maybe wait for a move, then long or short the retest.

1463 2018-08-20 20:51:59 Do you mean to tell me you aren't invested in natrocoin? You're missing out. I'm a millionaire thanks to natrocoin - the smart crypto currency!
1464 2018-08-20 20:51:55 Well played
1465 2018-08-20 20:51:51 True, but it is cheaper if you don't need all the ports. Lets say $100 cheaper and if the supply can be meant then all the crypto currency mining people would for sure buy the cards over the normal ones. Just think its an easier solution then making a card bad at mining.
1466 2018-08-20 20:51:36 I'm scheduling interviews with our @TCXhub team to talk about our new crypto exchange and mobile crypto payment platform. Let's chat!

1473 2018-08-20 20:50:55 With bitcoin crashing, maybe graphics card will go back to being reasonably priced and the word "crypto" will go back to meaning "cryptography".
1474 2018-08-20 20:50:53 Nah, founders edition are usually worse than aftermarket cards which usually are about the same price. Plus there’s not much of an upgrade over a 1080ti, the rtx series is just more focused on ray tracing which won’t help with mining
1475 2018-08-20 20:50:49 crypto Twitter is back

1478 2018-08-20 20:50:29 Is this due to the accelerated nature of crypto cycles vs. stocks, etc?

1486 2018-08-20 20:50:03 Being mad at Verge doesn't make sense. We can't control the market. What they are doing is adding vendors, exchanges, and are in the crypto news pretty much everyday. Bitcoin took 5 years to reach 10k. We are still pioneers to this world. Patience. So much is coming!!

1512 2018-08-20 20:46:30 That is probably true. I was more talking in a broader sense that we will likely see the same phenomenon in crypto that we see in other markets. People tend to sell at the bottom and buy at the top.

1518 2018-08-20 20:46:11 Nvidia is doing a slight of hand with these cards. When Crypto crashed earlier this year. they were stuck with excessive amounts of Pascal Cards. So u'll see 1070/1080/1080ti fill in the lower brackets until they all have been moved. Even if performance isn't that far off

1538 2018-08-20 20:43:34 Less than 400 people a minute do, with lightning being a completely unviable fountain of executions. 

And it's not even resistant to attack.
1539 2018-08-20 20:43:32 Well said, were all trying for crypto mass adoption. Some like this coin, some like that coin, bottom line is crypto for the win! People who try to shoot down a coin that's leading the charge in mass adoption is simply holding their own coin back. Were all part of the same fight!
1540 2018-08-20 20:43:09 And if lower might tell us something about the nature of crypto.
1541 2018-08-20 20:43:09 I don't think there is any good reason to believe a basket of crypto that has lost 90% of it's value can be "ridden out".
1542 2018-08-20 20:42:59 Coinbase I am a supporter for many years now this line perplexed me: “establishing relationships-liquidity providers in order to provide robust markets.” I understand the growth concept but continuing to provide crypto to day-to-day consumer is very critical for crypto’s maturity
1543 2018-08-20 20:42:56 Your company is garbage. A bunch of immature people running the show. Do what is best for the Crypto community and swallow your pride. Your business is more than 50% down from the beginning of the year. That should tell you something.

1599 2018-08-20 20:35:22 When they block you and delete messages those are the ones you should be careful from. Fuck that scam shit. #Crypto
1600 2018-08-20 20:35:15 Adult website Tube8 wants to pay users to watch #porn.   Finally, a job liberal arts majors are actually qualified for.   Before you college grads rush to apply, payments will be made in crypto currency.  Not even #Bitcoin, but some new Vice Token developed by the porn industry.
1601 2018-08-20 20:34:57 you must be joking
1602 2018-08-20 20:34:52 As much as I don't belive in double bottoms I surelly don't belive in tripple bottoms
1603 2018-08-20 20:34:24 $QASH lets users buy crypto from all over the world with the currency of their choice, with the world order book you can directly trade $NEO for $ICX using QASH as the underlying pair

Liquid will be revolutionairy to the cryptocurrency game
1604 2018-08-20 20:34:12 It seems ERC20 crypto, is based on Ethereum so they are all called 'tokens'. The DAOS tokens will change over to the DAPS mainstream in early 2019 and then will become 'coins'. I think I got that lot right but I am sure someone will be along soon to correct me if I'm wrong 
1605 2018-08-20 20:33:49 How about International create a tronscan wallet for a Friend day and put a Few #TRX in it, it could go over Huge, just a suggestion.

Everyone check out and join telegram!
1616 2018-08-20 20:31:42 We have a few setup where everyone can employ their specific strategy
1617 2018-08-20 20:31:39 Wow, not even prompted, just went straight for the jugular.
1618 2018-08-20 20:31:10 His original one, maybe. He still predicted .30-.40 price a few weeks ago when it was around .10. Just sayin’
1619 2018-08-20 20:31:10 “...the sheer number of ordinary people who invested in digital tokens over the last year, and who are likely to associate cryptocurrencies with financial ruin for a very long time.“ that's the reason this bear market will last very long
1620 2018-08-20 20:31:02 He’s a machine
1621 2018-08-20 20:30:58 Let’s see how this irrational market reacts to an expected denial on this #ETF in the next few days.

1622 2018-08-20 20:30:47 @Maybemore_DC I deserve a follow back at least...

1624 2018-08-20 20:30:33 day traders or swing traders?
1625 2018-08-20 20:30:33 Someone make a crypto-novelty account called Heath distributed Ledger
1626 2018-08-20 20:30:31 Fork a shitcoin from BTC then claim it’s the real Bitcoin
1627 2018-08-20 20:30:29 Bullshit! Not %1 own stock shares, but %18 crypto currency?
1628 2018-08-20 20:30:20 Man, all the money moved to Wynwood didn't????  Grab me a slice of key lime from Fireman Derek's and I'll pick you up at BTR.
1629 2018-08-20 20:30:03 Many people transact fine.

If it's so flawed, either attack it or contribute to make it better, or both.
1630 2018-08-20 20:30:02 To all the Crypto doubters, there's a guy out there that sold his 600 #Bitcoin stash bcuz the price dropped from $14 to $8... That guy is a complete idiot, but you don't have to be. #Hodlgang
1631 2018-08-20 20:29:58 Second, the Crypto Market is currently worth $200 billion. It's a pin on a needle compared to the current debt and financial market. Check out this image as example. Also notice that the SSC had no underlaying value, Bitcoin has. 2/3
1632 2018-08-20 20:29:55 I can't believe he is thinking that changing to crypto Currency with make the country rich again..
Ironic he wants to call it #ThePetro
1633 2018-08-20 20:29:52 Yeah thats what I mean, but the part about Crypto being about slavery etc is BS
1634 2018-08-20 20:29:24 I'm actually in a great position I can go in either direction up or down makes zero difference to me, I learned that from the beginning of my crypto adventure to never invest any money that I wasn't willing to lose
1635 2018-08-20 20:29:13 Yes.

I don't understand what you mean.
1636 2018-08-20 20:28:51 @SunXchang
 is a crypto/fiat exchange ecosystem in which individuals can carry out swift transactions from the comfort of their hood. #ico #sunxcoin #sunxcointoken
1637 2018-08-20 20:28:45 Even if they don’t know or realize what they’ve been tipped right now.. one day they will .Think if you had no knowledge of BTC someone was able to tip you bitcoin back in 2009 and you found out about it years later.. this is that. If they never find it consider it a coin burn.
1638 2018-08-20 20:28:43 That wouldn't be a huge bull run friend

5 waves down would mean you've draw the A wave of a correction
1639 2018-08-20 20:28:42 Look Vics, I mean your idea is that Ripple is scamming ppl. You are the savior to protect them. But  I am totally aware of the risk of crypto (including XRP), and with your comment you also say indirect that I am naive. Hope you understand that? Kids don’t play crypto, so please!
1640 2018-08-20 20:28:34 That’s a legit strategy just ask @CNBCFastMoney
1641 2018-08-20 20:28:30 @TraderScarface pretty much Dirty Harry
1642 2018-08-20 20:28:22 Please add hst to this list a great crypto token great team this list needs to add some great tokens with working mechanics vote 1 horizon state

1646 2018-08-20 20:27:45 Is this a guideline on how to let people steal your crypto
1647 2018-08-20 20:26:53 I kept $Nano all the way from 10 cents to $34 and back to 10 cents. cool huh?

1655 2018-08-20 20:25:49 What are the  Reasons you Should Consider AWS Mining as your Choice platform for Crypto Mining

1AWS is unarguably the best especially with transparency and efficiency. 

2I You get returns on a daily basis and make transfer to your wallet as low as $30

1682 2018-08-20 20:22:36 Anyone telling you to place stop losses are either idiots or shilling for whales who are stop hunting your crypto on alternate days.  The entire market is correlated, $btc is what is grossly overvalued presently.
1683 2018-08-20 20:22:35 I enjoy many of the articles on @Cointelegraph but I hope for the Editor’s sake he holds something. I would find it disheartening if he didn’t. Everyone has biases even if they try not to. If you’re into Crypto then you better hold some, end needless suicides!
1684 2018-08-20 20:22:28 Already there! 
1685 2018-08-20 20:22:22 Holy fuck that's crazy! I thought crypto-currency died! But honestly is there anything we can do? I mean if people can get money with that, I'd be hard to convince them to stop...
1686 2018-08-20 20:22:10 the best traders will not compete against each other. They are playing against themselves, day by day.

1693 2018-08-20 20:20:42 Whenever someone on the same team has a difference of opinion, I don’t get offended but, think they are looking for an opportunity to make things better. Other than doing nothing, to advance #Tron what do you suggest? LMN because when  you have a plan, you’ll need some support.
1694 2018-08-20 20:20:37 No bob the hole point of crypto is to stare at the screen 24/7 until we moon!!! or do i have it all wrong? LOL

1699 2018-08-20 20:20:10 Maduro tries to push petro, and at the same time arrests people for mining btc and transacting in crypto. That country needs a solid currency. I wonder where they can find a low volatile cryptocurrency? #MakerDAO #craycoin
1700 2018-08-20 20:20:09 Unless its all done in french language  but then again, crypto is international so i dont see a reason for them to make it only in french, if they want as many views as they can get

1736 2018-08-20 20:16:09 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。

1760 2018-08-20 20:13:21 If you started with one dollar:
1$*(38000/100) = 380$ //Here we count the gains
380$ * 0,05= 19$ //95% loss

So every invested dollar would bring you 19 dollars even after all that blood on streets. With 1K investment youd be sitting at 19K. Basic Crypto ride I guess, be patient.

1823 2018-08-20 20:08:04 One more issue I can see is price of IOTA, how can anyone can assure proper value of crypto ? There is no regulations.
1824 2018-08-20 20:08:04 Presumably this means you need photo ID to send and receive your own crypto from Coinbase?  How the hell does this make any sense.  I can understand if you are buying crypto but not for just moving it around.
1825 2018-08-20 20:08:01 I fully believe that 93.410091855% of **ALL statistics, are made up. 

**However, this does not impact the 80/20 Rule.   
It RULES.
Not based on specific numbers, but approx. 80% and approx. 20%.
As in 80% of you won't read or think about this; 20% WILL.
1826 2018-08-20 20:08:00 There is no need to worry about all the scammers in crypto. Yes, we should oppose them, but they cannot win. They can only fool through illusion. Illusion is a very fragile thing. It cannot survive the stressors of existence. So all illusions will be broken in time. Not #Bitcoin.

1867 2018-08-20 20:04:14 Hey, but real talk. Right now would be a great time to buy crypto because of how cheap it is, wait for another bubble in the market, sell it and make a small fortune! (8-10 grand is what I constitute as a small fortune) lol
1868 2018-08-20 20:04:08 2) Identifying purchasing power will always be valuable and practiced by those that monitor global markets. So, even if USD were to vanish, Bitcoin (and everything else) would still be measured to identify purchasing power.

Also, just because someone describes BTC value in USD, doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not a maximalist, York. 

Everything is measurable and how something’s measured is about as relevant as common perception.

1884 2018-08-20 20:02:13 I read a lot of tweets and snipbits about people's lives in crypto. It takes 3% of the population to start a revolution. Once that snowballs to 8% it starts to become mainstream.

2040 2018-08-20 19:42:04 if you dont want gender issues, why emphasize the women part?Dont want inequality dont play on it.Honestly it is what it is tho,if you can play your sexuality in crypto, of course your going to get ahead but that just proves alots of whats wrong. I judge on content n ur marketing
2041 2018-08-20 19:41:59 Hahaha. We’re all f@cked up but I will keep denying until I recover my loss

Chase debit card 4 intl. travel:

Debit Purchases
3% of the transaction amount

Or use #crypto, but still rely on a bank to get fiat
2055 2018-08-20 19:39:19 Scroll what a joke of a scam
2056 2018-08-20 19:38:55 I don’t speak for @team_tronics i speak for ME. So please don’t take my content to a team that has nothing to do with my questioning.
2057 2018-08-20 19:38:50 Yep was just posting about this its really great to see them doing so much work to make sure they check off al the normal and advanced crypto project needs
2058 2018-08-20 19:38:42 It's fake I Photoshopped it homie
2059 2018-08-20 19:38:36 @jasonappleton Hi Crow, been following you for some time, udemy courses were awesome. I got into making videos on alts as a way to pay it forward to the crypto community. Intrested it what it would take for the equipment.
2060 2018-08-20 19:38:35 well now frankly I’m disappointed in our community building efforts
2061 2018-08-20 19:38:28 v helpful IMO
2062 2018-08-20 19:38:20 People have been going back and forth about that since it came out. It can't be mined and its blockchain is centralized. I never really got into it because it's too closely tied to the system that crypto was intended to replace.
2063 2018-08-20 19:38:13 But you made the news which will end up being more memorable than the concert 
2064 2018-08-20 19:37:55 kidddding lol
2065 2018-08-20 19:37:47 Typical first day of work in crypto:

“Be sure to put 2FA on your Slack, backup your keybase, 2FA on your telegram, definitely your Twitter. And ah, don’t forget to download Signal and WeChat — in emergencies you can Snapchat or hit me on Gitter, but don’t you dare iMessage me”
2066 2018-08-20 19:37:43 GDP is a worthless distraction.

But with a crypto for money, it's very easy to do both. And crypto money is easy as well. Just need a bit of time.
2067 2018-08-20 19:37:32 Let's be honest buying 20 1080ti is better for crypto mining rather than buying one gpu with a life span of 1 month being used at full power
2068 2018-08-20 19:37:29 Booyakasha!
2069 2018-08-20 19:37:26 People like 21logician who can do nothing but crypto rofl

2075 2018-08-20 19:36:44 Excited to start this academic year! Welcome class of 2021 @georgemasonlaw! If you want to learn more about the #TurkeyCrisis #Crypto #finreg take my International Finance & Regulation seminar this term; or next term Business Associations to understand the issues of #Tesla buyout
2076 2018-08-20 19:36:27 I really wanted to attend this & got wait listed. In my experience, there are lots of journos who understand crypto, but MSM editors keep coverage basic as their audiences don't.
2077 2018-08-20 19:36:17 @LucasMoura7 is pictured why? The reason @SpursOfficial couldn’t buy anyone is because they were trying to buy in Crypto? 
2078 2018-08-20 19:36:10 Everywhere I look is calls for lower in crypto, shorts are stacking up..........am I stuck in the Groundhog Day?
2079 2018-08-20 19:35:43 That’s the worst

2084 2018-08-20 19:35:15 There’s a group tinder channel?! Lmao
2085 2018-08-20 19:35:08 Adult entertainment streaming company partners with #crypto and #blockchain company to reward its users with digital currency, banking on the technology’s potential to expand their consumer base and product engagement. 
2086 2018-08-20 19:34:48 Do you really ever talk crypto on your channel? Thatd be pretty cool.

2091 2018-08-20 19:34:04 It's a bit of a joke Nvidia making such a big deal about their new GPUs, when prices are so sky high that only arseholes trying to mine the last dregs of the crypto currency bubble before it bursts will be able to afford them. To regular consumers, it's almost irrelevant.
2092 2018-08-20 19:33:56 What’s your wechat sir. Can I add you as contact

2094 2018-08-20 19:33:46 @Crypto_Bitlord what do you think.. ProShares decision on 23 August.. BTC is again at the big support.. there are many stops.. if ETF is delayed again its likely that we break the support and get a big down move?
2095 2018-08-20 19:33:36 It will be possible as it is based on Ethereum contracts.

2098 2018-08-20 19:33:25 They are saying it's unethical but the truth is they don't even believe in their own product
Till now everything is legal in crypto space and even if they are securities buying back is legal
2099 2018-08-20 19:33:23 Decentralized ..centralized ..monopoly ..regular biz ..same pattern and mind set ..hope this will be so ! Yes we want to have safe environment for all to work. some will be left out , this is end of phase 1, next #satoshi #nakamoto will emerge phase 2 on it way

2112 2018-08-20 19:32:09 Crypto is an abomination. The idea of creating wealth by mining bitcoins on a computer is an affront to reason and logic. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of insanity that is crypto. I blame the thieving plutocrats who have stolen the wealth of the earth for this lunacy.

2125 2018-08-20 19:31:04 Sorry guys. You know what I mean though 
2126 2018-08-20 19:30:59 If I limited my Crypto purchases to coins that have a use case for me, I cant find any other then Bitcoin. All my other purchases are pure bets on the potential use cases appealing to others.

2139 2018-08-20 19:29:06 maybe educate yourself about the project first?  low volume is mostly due to small exchanges still , but CPX is a gem at this prices compared to it's ATH and potential after main net.

2202 2018-08-20 19:22:32 IDAP is creating a completely new ecosystem, built to facilitate a crypto derivatives
market where traders have access to multiple trading and investment instruments,
enabling a highly liberating, highly strategic, low risk and seamless trading
experience. @idap_io #IDAP #ICO
2203 2018-08-20 19:22:25 Back entry yes.  
That’s what I meant. That a no no for me
2204 2018-08-20 19:22:21 It's not about trading, it's about risk management and not getting greedy. If you put in all your life savings and even got a loan and you made several xs profit (which she had to if she invested in autumn), you take out at least your initial and let the rest roll.

2208 2018-08-20 19:21:59 Looking forward to seeing what you think
2209 2018-08-20 19:21:50 Well I feel bad for them. Helping is the main reason I started tweeting so actively on crypto.
2210 2018-08-20 19:21:30 You near Ibiza? I’m a big fan of that place.
2211 2018-08-20 19:21:20 LOL and insomnia.. watching #crypto 24/7..
2212 2018-08-20 19:21:20 I wouldn’t call that a depression in crypto. It’s extremely volatile. I believe we are very close to the start of the trend lines and S curve charts etc.  Mega early days. I believe we have a good 5-15 years of considerable change and onwards.
2213 2018-08-20 19:21:06 That's adorable.
2214 2018-08-20 19:20:58 when we used to go moon every day yes :)
2215 2018-08-20 19:20:42 But its unlikely :D so dont worry
2216 2018-08-20 19:20:26 Wechat is really just a chat app with fb like feeds + a wallet. Everything else is distraction

2222 2018-08-20 19:19:41 Lmao!!!!! I would punch you in the face and break your nose. Idk if it’s be worth it
2223 2018-08-20 19:19:35 Crypto is perfect for charities! Less money wasted on the middle man, Proof of receipt, etc . Do it dash!
2224 2018-08-20 19:19:32 Reasons to be bearish:

- bear flag 
- huge giraffe h&s forming 
- hidden bearish weekly divergence on stoch
- medium term trend bearish
- zero organic crypto demand 

Despite the above I am leaning to the bull side
2225 2018-08-20 19:19:28 an excellent opportunity to be useful for this wonderful project. I advise everyone to read the white paper. The idea is fantastic. This project is designed to revive the market of crypto currency!

2232 2018-08-20 19:18:51 Ah policing, just what the crypto libertarian always wanted 
2233 2018-08-20 19:18:48 Lol what idiot actually rocks a blockstream sticker. It's the crypto equivalent of: "I'm with stupid"
2234 2018-08-20 19:18:47 Oh I read the context... Still didn't help my eyes.
2235 2018-08-20 19:18:47 They thought they were gonna sell it to crypto people.
2236 2018-08-20 19:18:47 Fuck the ceos of icos that scam people

2248 2018-08-20 19:17:22 This is why you gotta read the context before...lol
2249 2018-08-20 19:17:10 Yes, but what kind of crypto? a descentralized one? Noooo... so it is one more SHITCOIN doomed to failure.
2250 2018-08-20 19:17:08 Its rare for a non believer and sceptic that you are to be so fully engaged in and well informed about crypto. Keep doing what you do. Your posts are well written and highly entertaining. 
2251 2018-08-20 19:17:01 A lot of Redditors do, but I doubt it. The thought is there will be a lot of over produced 10 series cards due to the crypto boom, but I have a feeling we won't see prices drop much until the 2060s and such come out.

So likely not for 3-6 months still IMO
2252 2018-08-20 19:17:00 CASH OUT!
2253 2018-08-20 19:16:41 Could also call it an law enforcement check...any concealed contraband....hmm
2254 2018-08-20 19:16:26 Pay off debt, invest in multiple rental units and some house flips, and travel the world
2255 2018-08-20 19:16:12 @jasonappleton Love the rants bud. I also like the old format when you just ran on about nothing. Or just about your life. Sometimes Crypto gets hard to listen too all the time.
2256 2018-08-20 19:16:09 そいつはモネロだな。エスペラント語でお金の意味だ。cryptonightアルゴリズムと呼ばれる独自の進化を行ってきた通貨で、前身として数々の通貨が存在してるぞ。こっちはDASHと違う匿名化技術を使って匿名取引を可能にしている。CryptoNoteはプロトコル名だから間違えるなよ。
2257 2018-08-20 19:16:07  crikey. Was thinking the same about all PC parts generally. Can’t all be down to crypto mining?
2258 2018-08-20 19:15:53 Пиши в директ @v1lat , он сказал, что поделится и у него много.

2260 2018-08-20 19:15:26 You’re a weird dude. But anytime you feel like getting one come see me in Spain
2261 2018-08-20 19:15:15 And VEN ... according to vlog
2262 2018-08-20 19:15:09 My reaction too.
2263 2018-08-20 19:14:59 Made nice profits trading $dgb. It certainly has potential, good tech, especially on security. Many other crypto’s rely on dgb security btw. but I am out of it for the moment. Its one I closely follow.
2264 2018-08-20 19:14:59 Lololol
2265 2018-08-20 19:14:53 Well when a man really likes a person, and he's hoping she's a woman, he'll ask her if he can park his car in her garage...and if she says back entry only...

Hell no we won't go...unless you don't give a damn...whatever works.
2266 2018-08-20 19:14:46 Kick the tires? What is al of this?
2267 2018-08-20 19:14:41 Don't be part of the manipulation.

2277 2018-08-20 19:13:44 Full of quotes from people who are assuming no responsibility for risking so much last fall, without understanding what they were doing. I don’t feel bad for them. Some of us got hit, but blame no one, and put ourselves in a position where that potential hit wouldnt ruin us.

2290 2018-08-20 19:12:19 I’m glad i stayed out of crypto. I’m also glad I didn’t try to convince of my friends to get in either
2291 2018-08-20 19:12:10 I got my current card( an RX480) from some Craigslist dude that failed at crypto
2292 2018-08-20 19:12:00 Not paying it’s electric bill?? Here’s hoping $AMZN doesn’t get into the crypto-mining business then...
2293 2018-08-20 19:11:51 If you invest more than 5 percent of your net worth I have no sympathy for you.
2294 2018-08-20 19:11:39 @All_In_Crypto @cryptoputz just because the fed can print cash doesn’t mean borrowers of debt can also... so how does that make sense?

2324 2018-08-20 19:08:18 This guy must believe in pseudoscience as well; It’s a common tactic to make an outlandish statement and say the burden of proof lies with others.
2325 2018-08-20 19:08:16 Lots of pole talking about fundamentals in Crypto. Fundamentals imply Supply AND Demand. The only one with Demand is $BTC (could argue $ETH). You are not HODLibg because if strong fundies but because of an idea
2326 2018-08-20 19:07:59 You can take it out on me..  I shouldn't have invited him to mariokart.  My body is ready. 
2327 2018-08-20 19:07:53 We are pleased to announce we have went into escrow using @SpurtPlus Spurt Plus Crypto. A stable and secure crypto making real estate transactions using crypto secure. Majority of crypto put clients at risk-due to unpredictable volatility, which could result in major losses.
2328 2018-08-20 19:07:46 Makes sense

2385 2018-08-20 19:02:13 It makes absolutely NO sense.
The media loves to showcase folks with  an unhealthy view on a specific stock/asset (I'm also looking at you stocks, gold, & crypto). Where it is ALWAYS a buy (or always a sell). Where the opinion is absolute.
The market doesn't deal in absolutes.

2426 2018-08-20 18:57:36 I see it everywhere around me. People spend less time on screens, checking prices, they build more, go out more, talk to people more, etc. If crypto was "only" about people starring at prices, praying of price increases - it would deserve to die. But it's not only about that.

2437 2018-08-20 18:56:44 i'm pretty sure almost nobody in the crypto markets is calculating expected price of bitcoin as an asset on its mining security

2558 2018-08-20 18:42:38 The prices on those GPUs were often much higher than MSRP because of crypto miners buying them up and some shortages of supply of various components used to make the GPUs. I wish they were cheaper, but they would probably run out of stock quickly if they sold it at $550.

2560 2018-08-20 18:41:59 Why does the crypto market hate on innovative technologies! Get out of your pocket and accept when sometimes can and will change the game! You talking crap about an awesome project just makes you appear ignorant.

2565 2018-08-20 18:41:35 Crypto caused the increase in Nvidia stock price due to demand for its GPU . Glad I bought some when they were $90 but sold a bit early at $150 should have held longer but still sold green!

2568 2018-08-20 18:41:31 I'm pretty sure everyone transacts less with all crypto when prices are in decline or perceived to be low.  Not clear enough value add for most people to use it all the time.  Wouldn't place too much stock on usage right now, as long as # accepting it growing.

Looks as if Nvidia is trying to make up for the Crypto mining bust that left them with thousands of 1080's laying around.

You will surely realize this on 10 September, and you will get back here to thank @Hashtags_Trends. Otherwise, @officialmcafee is so happy to cash out your money and flee to other project. Be ware.

Cats are inclined to buy the dip of dying crypto projects in hopes of gaining from a dead cat bounce. Even a dead cat will bounce up one last time before it’s final dirt nap. These guys don’t pussyfoot around.
2716 2018-08-20 18:24:22 Saying it’s more accurately described as one when it’s not even one is trying to claim it as one. It is more accurately described as a Ponzi scheme not a pyramid. Let me give you an example of a masternode that you can accurately describe as a pyramid scheme.

2773 2018-08-20 18:17:30 sell my 1 million $HOT so its real money not just on paper
2774 2018-08-20 18:17:30 Have you seen Malak or Barry?
2775 2018-08-20 18:17:28 Tu dois encore être dans le vert à l'heure actuelle
2776 2018-08-20 18:17:28 1-day settlement equivalent to spot markets: huge price boost.  Long only if you have enough FIAT.  Short sell only cryptos you actually own. No leverage means the least system risks. Institutional newbees no worry about crypto custody. Off-chain transfers safely within warehouse
2777 2018-08-20 18:17:27 Ah well, even if it would be, I can at least hope the crypto market doesn't do a number on the prices and supply chain like it did with the GPU market earlier this year.
2778 2018-08-20 18:17:26 #WarrenBuffett calls crypto "rat poison." When Coumadin first came to market, it was a life-saving drug that prevented strokes and heart disease. The drug was discovered as rat poison. But, in the end, the drug saved lives. Maybe #Buffett is onto something. #crypto #serendipity
2779 2018-08-20 18:17:20 This is what my article is about. Govt should reform its money and leave crypto to develop on its own.
2780 2018-08-20 18:17:13 まー、ユロドルははっきりとしたシグナル自体でていないからまだ修正は続くのかもしれないが、適切なレバレッジであれば問題のない範囲。
1.15を上回って強気の形状を作るようであれば損切りするだろう。

2791 2018-08-20 18:16:08 珍しいな。それはPeerCoinだ。どっから拾って来たんだ？それは世界初の「Proof of Stake」で動く通貨だ。ビットコインの採掘電気代がもったいないから、管理者をそのまま「金持ち」に委任したシステムだな。だけどこれには弱点があって、買い占めが起こると価値が下がるんだ。

2803 2018-08-20 18:15:23 For those that got ripped on the "crypto" bloated prices for 1080Ti's last year maybe lol. Other than that, the pricing on the reference 2080Ti is very bad. Just think when the non reference cards come out for $1200 and up. Normal people won't even be able to afford any of them.
2804 2018-08-20 18:15:17 I noticed the prices still haven't come down from last year's run on cards from the crypto craze.

2815 2018-08-20 18:14:16 What do ETH and BTC have to do with this? Shouldn't you hold the crypto that YOU'RE invested in to a standard of transparency that any cautious investor would demand?
If @Ripple dumping causes 3% $XRP inflation every quarter, shouldn't you care?
2816 2018-08-20 18:14:13 This is worse than taking a loan out to pay for a depreciating asset like a luxury car. You creatively lose money in two ways at the same time!

Crypto itself wasn't legalised until recently so all those early adopters were technically operating in grey area

2825 2018-08-20 18:13:16 @primeraair hi, a reminder that you still haven’t responded to my emails, it’s been 12 weeks now.
2826 2018-08-20 18:13:14 I will send my vag spare parts as a peace gesture.
2827 2018-08-20 18:13:01 No way I can’t make more in it than I do in crypto.
2828 2018-08-20 18:12:58 Using @Payoneer makes me remember why #crypto is so much better. So far I've spent 7 days setting up an account and still have more steps in their approval process. All this to send $50 to an overseas logo designer.
2829 2018-08-20 18:12:57 Congrats! Awesome prize!

2851 2018-08-20 18:11:51 They Been saying that sense 1978, but yet there still here.  But glad you like the new graphic cards, but something tells me by time they get out, most will bought up by crypto currency folk and will drive the cards even further up. And by then airplanes will be cheaper to own.
2852 2018-08-20 18:11:43 This is good for crypto, right?

2894 2018-08-20 18:07:59 The real winner. Maybe they’re behind crypto “fake news” and have gone Putin on the world.
2895 2018-08-20 18:07:59 People are down heavy? Tron kept its price pretty well! Unless you bought the top.
2896 2018-08-20 18:07:57 As a VR geek, I'm so hyped for a $499 card that is way better than the already pretty great 1080ti.. This is going to help ALOT.  And I'm sort of glad the crypto hype is past.  Anyone sitting on used 1080s hoping to resell just got a big dose of disappointment.
2897 2018-08-20 18:07:53 Yeah so im  getting one 2080Ti for myself before anything crazy (crypto) happens again.
2898 2018-08-20 18:07:49 If all the US shenanigans ref accrediting a traditional exchange to play nice with crypto works, the fomo may earn me a wedge but some decent altcoins are going to go under if things don’t start rising soon. Shitcoin armaggedon is upon us already.

2913 2018-08-20 18:04:52 I used to record myself reading poetry. 
They said that recording yourself improves memory and confidence. I guess it worked then.

Now, I read crypto definitions. 

Because, well, cryptographers are scary and my voice is not like theirs. 

So yes, crypto is the new poetry

2924 2018-08-20 18:03:21 It's the battery for your brain...... Please donate all crypto within 20 hours or it'll be lost forever!!
2925 2018-08-20 18:03:03 There’s a lot of members of the TRON Community that have donated to local artists or people in need. Celebrity’s are very important not for the funding but because they have a huge voice in their community to do so much good. Great view on this though @crypto_vino

@FXpresso 

Been killing it trading commodities and stocks. 

If you haven’t started diversifying your trading profile from crypto, I’d recommend getting a 1Broker account and following along
2959 2018-08-20 17:59:19 Is it possible? I'm in crypto for half a year but it's the first one that really impresses me. Take a look at this #CINDX #ICO
2960 2018-08-20 17:59:15 Post token sale plan can be fake, but many don’t even have that. People just fall into silly promises that they will earn fast. That’s a bit sad that all people know about related to blockchain is crypto currencies.
2961 2018-08-20 17:58:37 -83% 
You guys could have led the charge, been the xRapid partner for the US and helped guide the discussion on crypto regulation in the US
Instead you chose maximalism and whatever other reasons, & completely ignored a massive part of your user base.
Ah well
2962 2018-08-20 17:58:26 Having started investing in #crypto late December, it’s safe to say I’ve been beaten down plenty of times

BUT it has forced me to adapt and learn far quicker than I would have in a bull run

I am prepared and will dump @ #btc ATH to the new noobs

#circleoflife
2963 2018-08-20 17:58:21 Irrational drop after ETF denial.

2966 2018-08-20 17:57:57 Nvidia has just betrayed the whole PC gaming community by joining the crypto speculation bubble

2968 2018-08-20 17:56:59 youre going to start the crypto bull run with this demand lol
2969 2018-08-20 17:56:57 That’s cause it’s a completely fraudulent bullshit coin
2970 2018-08-20 17:56:52 Crypto got a lot of people into twitter. I'd love to see exact figures on how many twitter users are strictly on here for crypto info.
2971 2018-08-20 17:56:51 And, the fuckstick probably sold the domain cheap too!

2973 2018-08-20 17:56:48 Okay but you still don’t get it. If someone else make a masternode on one of the coin you have, do you make money off them creating a masternode?
2974 2018-08-20 17:56:40 Check what the people behind Cardano did with their ico and where IOHK is located. IOHK is in Hong Kong, ico was marketed in Asia, the foundation is located in Switzerland, etc etc. Nothing in the US because of negativity towards crypto.
2975 2018-08-20 17:55:33 Only in the US i guess. ah ah
2976 2018-08-20 17:55:30 I doubt it though

2983 2018-08-20 17:54:35 Yes, but it remains intricately tied to owning the actual box. If you want to start fresh you can buy a new box. Similarly, in any crypto pseudonym system, reputation below some threshold would be equivalent to a ban.

2986 2018-08-20 17:54:04 We should also mine crypto when fuckin yes
2987 2018-08-20 17:53:38 @RMGNetworks RMGN is not a crypto company.

2989 2018-08-20 17:53:20 Was #crypto in a bubble? I thought it was just the first phase of the Adoption Curve. Bubble will come when it's mainstream

2992 2018-08-20 17:52:30 nVidia is expected to really tank, relatively speaking, due to the loss of demand from crypto.  In the end, I'd expect them continue business like it's mid-2017 again in the next year or two.  But we showed them that we're ok with the price hike so they'll never normalize again.
2993 2018-08-20 17:52:25 so with the NVIDIA RTX 2000, will we be able to mine crypto faster? $BTC.X $ETH.X
2994 2018-08-20 17:52:07 Ya I issue is if you can get them before the crypto currency miners buys up all the preorder stock

i say ostensibly because mn discords  are rife with “investors” that got barbecued
3011 2018-08-20 17:49:39 Ripple labs controls over 60% of all XRP, right? And isn't ripple's long term goal to enable fiat-to-fiat transactions on the ledger, rendering the token useless? Even IF ripple succeeds, the XRP token is worthless.

3028 2018-08-20 17:46:47 There’s plenty of asset-backed cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, I know a large number of brokers and investors who have done very well trading in the crypto space. Sounds like you need to do more research and networking.

2. Start with free hashpower.
3.Refer friends for more hashpower
4.Wait for balance to reach minimum for withdrawal.
5. Reach minimum, submit withdrawal request.
6. THEN they say you must invest first
7. THROW LAPTOP OUT WINDOW, FUCK IT
3065 2018-08-20 17:40:35 Haha thats not what "tron" means just because its bear market, thats everything bud. The "next tron" means it pumps from say 30 sats to 2000 sats which tron did in two weeks. The low sat coin is under a cent so it pumps to say 20cents like tron, which is a top10 crypto
3066 2018-08-20 17:40:18 Totally agreed with that, plus everyone earns decent money not based on their location or skin. But problems always in fees and freelance platforms, right now I'm waiting on launching #LinkChainX, because I prefer to work for $crypto and save on fees.

3080 2018-08-20 17:37:11 Venezuela setting up a crypto called petro has been the stupidest thing I head today.
3081 2018-08-20 17:37:07 Side note: Not a single Stockbroker that I know of ever fell for crypto. No underlying asset. Only people who didn't know any better bought into it. You're better off hiring a stockbroker and asking him to find you a stock ready to break through.

3089 2018-08-20 17:36:10 I've been watching this debate progress for a while.
I agree that celebs are probably rich enough.
Targeting a charity or disaster fund might be misconstrued and poor taste.
So I'm somewhat on the fence. 
Maybe using celebs in short term is best and the charity will come in time.

3101 2018-08-20 17:34:11 The fact that an ETF (something we didn't give a fuck of a few months ago) rejection would lead to an overreaction and a possible break of a yearly support, makes me think how sad people are. Like an approval would moon us...

3129 2018-08-20 17:29:31 Good article - and how I first envisioned your concept of the #stokvelmicrogrid working - producers and consumers automatically transacting with each other on an open exchange with energy prices fluctuating according to supply and demand.

3132 2018-08-20 17:29:17 When you include other similar activities, like gambling & lotteries (which are arguably closer to crypto than investments) you find that access is greater there, as there are no wallets, irreplaceable keys, etc slowing them down.

And you need several years for these to develop.

3144 2018-08-20 17:27:21 That thought crosses my mind a lot when I see pics or vids of Roger, passionately defending PoVs that he seems to know are untrue.

3145 2018-08-20 17:27:15 "Crypto" by Stephen Levy 
3146 2018-08-20 17:27:11 You failed to mention that Linda has a long way to reach the max supply unlike other coins/tokens where devs have a huge premine or ICO. Linda never had an ICO and also reduced the max supply from 50 billion to 30 billion. TPAY is the TP of crypto.

3159 2018-08-20 17:24:44 Amigo, even the United States is lacking in the prerequisite technological structure for mass adoption of crypto. 
1) <.001% of stores are able to handle crypto transactions 
2) a great number of people don't have portable 4g devices able to transact
3) regulatory structures?

3166 2018-08-20 17:23:56 My investment strategy is to hold a small percentage of crypto in my portfolio. This doesn’t prevent me from spending it. If my crypto holdings fall below my target allocation due to spending, price decline, appreciation of the rest of my portfolio, etc. I simply buy more crypto.

Maybe it’s better if you’re selling a product that requires a censor-resistant platform? For now, stores must select 1 crypto to accept: BTC, BCH, or ZEC.

3375 2018-08-20 16:56:09 It looks like bulls are not ready yet to cross the major overhead resistance that came to be $6.5k and will consolidate their strength in the above mentioned price range before attempting another attack. #BTC #bitcoin #Crypto

3475 2018-08-20 16:46:19 Si on pouvait se délester de cette incertitude permanente.. Mais bon ça ne serait pas marrant puisqu'on aurait alors la connaissance du ATL.. En ce moment on les subit chaque jour pour les #altcoins.

3477 2018-08-20 16:46:16 そっちはビットコインキャッシュだ。ビットコインのビッグブロックの思想を引き継いだハードフォーク通貨になる。ムーア法則に則って無限にブロック容量が増えていく…って言っても初心者は分からないから、とりあえず、思想の違うビットコインって考えて良いぞ。
3478 2018-08-20 16:46:07 Crypto will be mainstream when i get paid in crypto. Until then crypto is only a gambling machine which can be controlled a bit by research.
3479 2018-08-20 16:45:51 These comments are what I hate about the crypto world - rather than discuss this relevant point, the investors shoot it down - This is why so people are losing money. This also shows the market is too immature with everyone claiming to be a business expert
3480 2018-08-20 16:45:30 Nice video! But would look better when you put an #IOTA logo on the charging station. That would be a feeless and fast (as the Panamera) payment :)

3481 2018-08-20 16:45:27 Are you implying that people in other nations use gold as a currency or store of value?

Or perhaps implying that Bitcoin is somehow bringing currency to poorer nations that we're already years ahead of the EU and decades ahead of the US on C2C electronic payments?
3482 2018-08-20 16:45:24 At the time, more new people invested in crypto than ever before in 2013 too. They all got burned. FOMO investing will happen again. Ppl will get burned again. 

If you're only investing to "catch the wave" in a hyper volatile asset class, you are asking to get burned.

3484 2018-08-20 16:45:16 I don't know if we've reached the crypto bottom yet.

What I do know: a lot of people still put a lot of energy into this space - on twitter, reddit and news outlets. Especially those, who paint gloomy pictures.

Why might that be, I wonder? 
3485 2018-08-20 16:45:01 The current crypto market is just CT and whales countertrading each other as normies continue living their block chain free lives. In 1-2 years I can't wait to be called "lucky" with the rest of CT. Grind hard

3488 2018-08-20 16:44:53 Not the slightest bit inadvisable to offer caution against affiliating w/ frauds during a legal trial. What makes you think that I think DD will keep the crypto? Obviously DD will have to sell most of the crypto donations to pay lawyer fees.

3490 2018-08-20 16:44:44 That doesn't negate the fact legacy systems also have many faults, at much larger scale, orders of magnitude. My point being that it's disingenuous to frame crypto as being exclusive to having poor investor outcomes, especially given tiny fraction in relative scale to legacy.

3586 2018-08-20 16:34:06 Because crypto was heavily pushed as "investment for the everyman" - it was a way around "cumbersome" regulations. You're not a fool if everyone lies to you.

3616 2018-08-20 16:29:47 @YOKOMSON @jlhgl @Straight_Crypto @ZachfromRollag @CStangeland @mrshowtime05 This is pretty brilliant. I already have a draft board, but I might consider doing this for Hagel and Byron rather than just the chat. Also useful for future years if we're split between live and remote.
3617 2018-08-20 16:29:37 Right. We need new money...and by that I mean large institutional investors cranking up the daily volume and creating more liquidity.

3619 2018-08-20 16:29:16 We will see huge over reactions from the market during a muli year price discovery period for this asset class. It will be driven by raw emotion only made possible by lack of friction, which ironically is one of the things which makes crypto inherently valuable in the first place
3620 2018-08-20 16:29:14 Literally everyone - the mainstream press, indie press the ICOs, coin forums, telegram groups, crypto meetups, "experts", "hackers", EVERYONE - painted a false narrative about crypto's potential.

The only "fools" were the people that *didn't* invest, according to them.

3631 2018-08-20 16:27:51 Crypto is easier to invest in than almost any other asset. That made it more available to a much broader audience of unsophisticated investors than is true in almost any other market.

3638 2018-08-20 16:27:03 それはわかるだろ散々ツイートしてんだから
3639 2018-08-20 16:27:01 Let's suppose we have demand for 1000 BTC at price x and supply is only 500 BTC at price x. Normal behaviour would be, that the buyers needs to pay more for the other 500 BTC. If someone sells 500 unbacked paper BTC at price x, the price wouldn't go up.

Am I wrong on this?
3640 2018-08-20 16:26:56 Me either. Maybe that made us expendable.

3660 2018-08-20 16:24:43 It could be seen that way, no one is forcing you to do anything. The idea isnt an all out protest, but reducing the amount of time we spend on the sites, reducing their ad revenue/reach. It would take a lot of people to make a statement. Its a good question, ask it on the tweet

3678 2018-08-20 16:22:27 This is really sad. During the 2017 hype cycle, everyone was convinced crypto was going to go up forever, and happily abandoned common sense.
3679 2018-08-20 16:22:00 If you were truly a representative of the crypto space you would be, since it's a scam. Ye ye. I'm half your age old lady and make more money then you.
3680 2018-08-20 16:21:52 My biggest concern with NVDA is the decline of the crypto market. That was a main buying point for their products by a lot of people and now that the bubble has popped and is slowly declining I think it'll be harder to rally buyers. eSports on the rise though so it's tough call.
3681 2018-08-20 16:21:51 This has nothing to do with crypto currency. It’s an unfortunate reflection of the general lack of understanding of investing — speculation vs investing, risk vs reward, diversification among uncorrelated assets, etc.

Then go on from there with your general and easy to understand #blockchain and #crypto explanations.
3703 2018-08-20 16:18:43 My hypothesis is #crypto has the lowest friction between market psychology/sentiment and how a market reacts we have seen in human history.

Traditionally we have buffers to soften this relationship. On bitmex you can 100x naked short with just the internet and an email address.

3749 2018-08-20 16:13:14 congratulations guys!
3750 2018-08-20 16:12:50  Shit. That must mean I’m on to something.

Alby, Nic, Medra and GFY weren’t part of that thread, but we were talking about it the other day. Wonder if they are blocked too.

3759 2018-08-20 16:11:24 A slap on the wrist! SEC won't be serious until after a bankruptcy. SEC only punishes failed crooks.
3760 2018-08-20 16:11:19 My point is, XRP is worthless in the crypto space. Bitcoin is not. You will get rekt as you all did from late december to today. When all of you bought the dip.. everytime, until you had 0 dollars left, n then it fell 50% more.
3761 2018-08-20 16:11:19 ですです！
楽しみですが同じ方向感覚で嬉しいです！

3776 2018-08-20 16:08:17 ..makes more sense. $CHX for example raised $3-4m for 65% of all tokens and currently capped at $1m. for the team to make money going forward they will need to deliver the platform and revenue from their business model and to me is a much better risk/reward than some new $30m#ico
3777 2018-08-20 16:08:13 Naah, its huge informations, If I’m going to learn, i will prefer that to create my coin, its the best way to gains money

3786 2018-08-20 16:07:20 @justinsuntron did you hear? @Official_IGG just reached their 10M softcap goal in just 17 days. That is a hallmark for @Tronfoundation #TRX and the entire #TRX20 ecosystem. Having the first legit #ICO complete on the platform is huge! #blockchain #thefutureofgaming #crypto #IGG
3787 2018-08-20 16:07:05 even discounting the huge number of straight-up scammers - the hype to production-system ratio in blockchain and crypto is *stratospheric*. rational decision is to pay no heed to any of it until it shows itself to work well in the real world. burden of proof is 100% on advocates.

3792 2018-08-20 16:06:38 @DassCoin is a token for the moment! It is set to revolutionise the crypto world.
3793 2018-08-20 16:06:24 Ok, let me rephrase my question. Is it possible to suppress the price of the underlying BTC by creating artificial "paper" claims?
3794 2018-08-20 16:06:10 This is exactly why for me #ico's don't make sense anymore. Especially those raising more than $10m for a minority % ownership of outstanding tokens. For me the lower MCAP projects with actual work being done where the team only makes money on a materially higher token price..

3798 2018-08-20 16:05:41 And crypto mining gets more efficient the more a chain is used...
3799 2018-08-20 16:05:37 I think the problem is that at the time when systemd tries to start something, something else, on what the first something depends on, isn't available yet.

What is that crypto stuff? My swap partition is not encrypted. No partition is encrypted on that machine, sadly.
3800 2018-08-20 16:05:28 This is why people are big on crypto. It's far from perfect in its current state, but finite supply is one of its many advantages. 

Watch the film called the Big Short, you'll like it - it highlights the problems of banks printing money that lead to the 2008 financial crisis.

3817 2018-08-20 16:03:27 Made a typo transaction are NOT anonymous using BTC. So strangely the arguments you provide have no base but are provided by clickbait press who's same owner are preparing their own crypto markets.
3818 2018-08-20 16:03:26 XRP is centralized. It’s not a crypto. Enough said.

3861 2018-08-20 15:58:46 I think, occasionally at least, we can consider crypto gambling. According to super information, all hot news, there is no logical reason why crypto loses its value. XRP especially. You can say like wait, wait, wait, but nobody knows, time will tell. Crypto can rise, or can´t...
3862 2018-08-20 15:58:43 Sad!
3863 2018-08-20 15:58:37 What is the simplest and most basic but still helpful explanation of blockchains and crypto that you’ve seen (article, book, podcast, etc.)
3864 2018-08-20 15:58:35 pretty much yes. the @quant_network team are pursuing the same strategy which is to pursue exchange listings once their platform or SDK in their case is released. $CHX $QNT
3865 2018-08-20 15:58:28 
3866 2018-08-20 15:58:24 Really good conversation... I'm asking because @tuanaphan1 put $XTL on my radar recently. I looked into it a bit, and wanted to know other peoples thoughts on mobile mining. Are you personally interested in any mobile mining projects?
3867 2018-08-20 15:58:23 Looks like we are in crypto stasis :-)
3868 2018-08-20 15:58:15 Could it be you are now affected in the other direction. It sound to me the power that shouldnt be have almost succeeded to convince that all those crypto projects are worthless. Let’s not loose sight that crypto technology is the most threatening technology to existing powers!

3895 2018-08-20 15:55:08 You mean that @rogerkver centralized Bcash $BCH forked coin that he’s trying to scam others with so he can get rich off?  Weird how garbage is still garbage

3903 2018-08-20 15:54:14 I don’t know what’s worse:

2. Tagging someone on twitter that hasn’t tweeted in 7 years. 

Desperate times call for desperate measures I guess, huh?!? $DIG
3904 2018-08-20 15:54:12 @rogerkver do something!
3905 2018-08-20 15:54:11 I am amazed that that scam $bcash lasted that long
3906 2018-08-20 15:54:05 agreed ! :)
3907 2018-08-20 15:53:59 Yeah totally agree. I keep forgetting that people altso sell on the way down without buying lower etc. and get spooket out that way.

3925 2018-08-20 15:51:20 August was the start of last year's Cryptoasset boom. While ending in January, the price is still higher from the initial rally. Investments take time, and in crypto people expect shit to happen over night. This shit is stocks on crack regardless. I wish people saw that.

3946 2018-08-20 15:48:39 Most people consider crypto assets gambling even though they do not know anything about it.

They do not look into it because that prejudice is so strong. Amazing to witness this behavior. Once prices rise they _still_ do not do research and just think that people just got lucky.

4023 2018-08-20 15:41:25 The only major problem with crypto currency today is that BTC is 50% of the market but can't scale to handle that. If we distribute the market share among many crypto currencies, that's an instant scaling solution and makes them all functional currencies today.

4044 2018-08-20 15:39:02 Blockchainウォレットの便利なところはクラウドだったこと。
同じBTC財布をiPadからでもパソコンからでも見られました。
しかし，復元フレーズを使えば，どのウォレットでも（例えばcopayでも）同じことができました。
考えれば当たり前のことですが，実際にできて嬉しい

4046 2018-08-20 15:38:54 XRP will slowly but surely take over. Bitcoin is way too slow and its fees are too high to be successful for retail use. XRP will become the dominant choice for transferring money or when buying items retail (once the crypto market place really grows).

4050 2018-08-20 15:38:34 It's no new arguments there's just a hype and mix with trading and use case of blockchain. But if you want to talk economics I like the Mises point of view and by such crypto have a lot to bring on the table. BTC is more tangible to me than gold :D

4062 2018-08-20 15:37:25 This is a strategy for whales to be able to appear positive on crypto when in reality the ETFs have a history of being denied. This creates hype and Fomo. Which leads to sell offs when these ETFs are denied. Which allows the whales to be able to get into the market at low prices.

4108 2018-08-20 15:32:14 There is currently no popular crypto currency that does not use mining. I'm highly sceptical against the hype on blockchain and crypto although your argument to use it to distribute storage costs is a new argument.
4109 2018-08-20 15:32:14 True but if you spend crypto like myself and others you buy laptop/coffee/service in crypto (convenience & it supports the network growth) and then replace that crypto ASAP or even better at a point that makes sense in the market cycle.

4117 2018-08-20 15:31:21 Society has had multiple stores of value, as none is perfectly secure. Gold, oil, dollars, real estate, (some) bonds & equities. Crypto is the first that’s decentralized *and* digital.
4118 2018-08-20 15:31:19 People are wishing and hoping for some relief. Insead of realizing that the crypto market has never been tied to an ETF at all. Over generated ETF hype bring an unintended consequences when the ETF doesnt get aporoved. Which looks like what happened when winkelvoss etf is denied.

4146 2018-08-20 15:26:16 There's a difference between mining and cryptocurrency. Mining consume a lot of electricity but you can create crypto like us create dollar, instantly for thin air. But it protect the chain and incentive his use.

4194 2018-08-20 15:20:07 This is a mature and accurate statement, and refreshing to see. All these "my coin is better than your coin" fights are pointless and frustrating. There are, and will be, several coins that become mainstream each with their own use case points (assuming crypto is embraced) IMO

4197 2018-08-20 15:19:31 I don't think anyone is expecting that % growth again. But I'd rather invest in a crypto that has utility than one that is slow, has high fees, is controlled by 4 Chinese mining companies, and its claim to fame is it sits there real well. Utility will be king in crypto.

4216 2018-08-20 15:18:01 I would love to be believe this but the entirety of human history shows that power/wealth always end up being concentrated in a few hands. No matter revolutions, wars, famine, re-starts, etc. Concentration of wealth = centralization by definition. Crypto shows same tendencies.
4217 2018-08-20 15:18:01 Tron really might end up being internet 3.0.  I thought it was going to be Ethereum.  But crypto kiddies made ethereums network crash.  And in terms of scalability thats trash.  Imagine the world trying to perform transactions on that.  It would literally explode
4218 2018-08-20 15:17:59 ^ this is the reason the crypto-sphere is fucked beyond possible catharsis. 
Not every project works like dogecoin with a block and a chain. We provided you with the reason, the meaning, you still play dumb, or you are dumb, who knows.

4226 2018-08-20 15:17:12 Controversial. $BTC etf will be rejected. All of them. Market cycles are getting longer. I think ETF is a long way away. If china open up to crypto, it’s going to be massively bullish and signal the restart of an upward trending market. Give it 8 months

4303 2018-08-20 15:10:45 Correct - you can "cash in" with any crypto because we have integrated shapeshift. That includes BTC. But now you hold BCH, so when you send you are sending BCH. Therefore fees are low because they are BCH transfers.

4317 2018-08-20 15:09:30 I think the notion of a cooperative consensus is a great idea for a technology. It's just that Bitcoin, as originally presented and implement, is more full of holes than swiss cheese and its primary value is in eastern european and russian money laundering.

4328 2018-08-20 15:08:38 The problem with the new crypto is that while seeking legitimacy for this space they tend to shit on the other investments. That is VERY dangerous. There are other good investments outside of crypto! Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Your focus should be to increase regularly your $BTC and $ETH bags.

This will distribute the risk from potentially dead coins to the two most stable crypto vehicles.

4471 2018-08-20 14:55:14 Confession Monday.
When I first started crypto the majority of the people I followed was Ripple wait XRP um I mean “Zerp”? I quickly realized I was following the wrong people. If it weren’t for Bitcoin none of this would be here. Keep trying to knock BTC, it’ll always be top spot
4472 2018-08-20 14:55:07 @Trey_Parker_ Trey, let's talk about setting up the very first South Park Crypto Token. It  could be used to win prizes on SP Central or something. Drop  me a note and let's get to work building the Cartman Coin (aka - the RMA coin, Respect Mah Authorita!) together!!!
4473 2018-08-20 14:55:04 But kind sirs I'm US.  it says im not allowed.  what do now?

4478 2018-08-20 14:54:30 A bear flag has developed on $BTCUSD since 8/13/18 at @binance. The pattern is nearing completion, meaning sideways trading is leading to a likely breakout to the downside. Needs to stay above $6500 today to stay in the pattern. #BTC #crypto

4483 2018-08-20 14:53:24 So, when does everyone think this bear market is going to end? Do you think we're in for another run #like we saw this time last year? Are #Bitcoin ETF's really the 'make or break' of #crypto? Comment below what you do to keep yourself sane in this current market. #cryptocurrency
4484 2018-08-20 14:53:16 I hope you figure out a solution for yourself! I myself had struggled through it too and sometimes I still do, you're not alone! Its tough/sending you all the good vibes I can give you
4485 2018-08-20 14:53:15 Is crypto twitter full of attention seekers?
4486 2018-08-20 14:52:46 I agree with Avi, we’re seeing really talented engineers and PMs transitioning into crypto and we are working on a project on this so keep an eye out GCR 
4487 2018-08-20 14:52:44 When I talk with Jeff Wang – the smartest crypto guy I know – he says Crypto is...

What the internet was in the 1980’s 
What the smart phone was in the 2000’s 
"robert kiyosaki"
4488 2018-08-20 14:52:24 This $BTC down trend will continue until we go back to 10k and stay there for a while, if that happens it will grab everyone attention again. Actually there is no excitement about #crypto and no one cares about it, over the last months we have seen all kind of people leaving.
4489 2018-08-20 14:52:05 Amen. Not to mention they are targeting a true global issue in cross border payment. We are spoiled and many dont realize there are tons of poor/non technologically advanced countries in the world this will help. @Ripple will help change the world. Patience is a virtue

4499 2018-08-20 14:51:03 Barclays accelerator is working - they have partnered with their start-up Crowdz (uses Ethereum blockchain) - in an attempt to catch up with Santander working with Ripple for cross-border transactions. Banks are racing to use blockchain. #bitcoin #ethereum #ripple #crypto #news
4500 2018-08-20 14:51:02 Done
4501 2018-08-20 14:51:01 Stop listening to crypto twitter “charters” shorting the market and manipulating their followers
4502 2018-08-20 14:51:00 the other thing about XRP is that it's a good counterargument to Bitcoin decentralisation ideology, proof of work etc - it seems that in practice, the crypto market doesn't care about "crypto" ideology. centralised tokens trades in the same marketplaces, on the same basis.
4503 2018-08-20 14:50:51 Perlstein decodes in BEFORE THE STORM the message of Goldwater's campaign slogan "In Your Heart You Know He's Right" as an encouragement to crypto-racists to vote for maintaining de facto segregation.

4528 2018-08-20 14:47:26 Because regulation of the online gambling environment has restricted the possibility there. Add to that the age group of the target market and it makes sense for advertisers to jump in
4529 2018-08-20 14:47:25 It’s just the beginning. People will begin transitioning from being “aware” - to owning; with more simplified education. Not everybody wants to contend with the crypto lingo. They just want real world benefits and use cases

4552 2018-08-20 14:44:28 The fundamental idea directly or indirectly addressed in all crypto discussions is that of censorship resistance and, more specifically, to what degree. 

The reality of this is inviolable. 

Having a strong grasp on the concept is imperative to long term investment decisions.
4553 2018-08-20 14:44:23 honestly?  tax GPUs and miner ASICs at 100 percent.  tax crypto "capital gains" at 100 percent.  voila, no more internet nerd money.  these rubes will go back to hiding cash in their mattress, just like nature intended.

2. Do research appropriately without FOMO (erased in 1.) rushing you.
3. Then invest accordingly in what you believe is solid LT. No day trading at this point.

4622 2018-08-20 14:35:33 This is the NWO in action where they redistribute the wealth they steal from whites and give to others.  This has been going on there for years.

4626 2018-08-20 14:34:42 That's kind of like saying we should be thankful to locusts for crop research. If crypto is moving away from using GPUs, that's great, but the idea that gaming GPUs were improved by being bought up en masse by miners and priced out of reach of gamers won't fly.

4660 2018-08-20 14:31:17 i dont think the crypto market can be cleaned up. the impulse of exchanges to make comments about price action (bitmex ceo saying $50k btc this fall) is just as manipulative as a whale dumping a coin. both sides engage in bad behavior.
4661 2018-08-20 14:31:14 I like the idea of transparency. Ghosts scare me!

4729 2018-08-20 14:23:24 Ripple made a heap, Satoshi mined a heap. Sure his mining involved less risk than what it does now, but there is still a fundamental difference. I think we are arguing past each other, and probably wont see eye to eye and I have an assignment due, so imma cut it short here.Cheers

Ups! Jetzt habe ich oben crypto und seinen Ex Wuce in einem Tweet erwähnt  das gibt sicher wieder Diskussionen. 
4748 2018-08-20 14:21:18 Also what about the fact that most mass shootings are carried out by people with mental health issues and even that transit related deaths in Canada double homicide rates? Shouldn't mental health funding be a bigger issues than locking more people up?
4749 2018-08-20 14:21:07 ETFs will delay the acceptance of crypto by the masses. ETFs should be allowed after acceptance by the all country of the world. It's the Currency of the world.

4825 2018-08-20 14:12:30 "Ripple made tokens & kept a heap" is how u described it & said that's different than Satoshi. At early inception, btc was effortless 2 mine. How many did Satoshi mine effortlessly? If u dont have any idea/proof, how can u claim  its different? Thats what Im trying to understand
4826 2018-08-20 14:12:26 Oh, I completely agree, but that's not the point, it's to compete with the speed and self-reliance crypto offers.  I don't see the same payment rails though, it should be possible to transfer like XRP.  Businesses will have to pay taxes in crypto USD, thus, not going anywhere.

4836 2018-08-20 14:11:27 Ok, so we are getting somewhere :-) XRP and BTC are two different approaches towards crypto currency, or let’s say different philosophies, and time will give us an answer which one will get utilized globally. No scam, no fraud just two solutions trying to prove its worth.

4859 2018-08-20 14:08:17 Issuing their own crypto currency would be barely any different to the digital forms of fiat they already have. It wldn't be decentralized, it wldn't be counterpart-risk-free, & it wld probably move across the same payment rails (messaging layer + ledger adjustment) = same probs.

4875 2018-08-20 14:06:23 "Once an innovation reaches a certain level of popularity, its success is virtually assured. By the same token, great innovations can fail because the domino effect doesn't kick in." - @mjmauboussin 

Adoption is the most important hurdle that crypto faces.
4876 2018-08-20 14:06:17 Something I learnt late was that I should adjust my position size to where my stoploss is and place my stoploss where my idea is invalidated. Not figure out a preset amount of margin and then pick stoploss from there

4883 2018-08-20 14:05:26 With no external money coming to crypto, we will have to rely on fake Tether printing for future pumps. Not impossible, Yupe that can be an idea If “the crypto community” agrees. For me the so called centralized & decentralized debate is futile unless we bring “safety”
4884 2018-08-20 14:05:20 Solid point. Toppings are more of a discrete variable than a continuous variable, aren’t they?

4917 2018-08-20 14:01:59 I didnt say it was bad/greedy. U guys brought that up. I simply argued what @Ripple did and what Satoshi did are different things.  It doesn't matter how many he mined in total, it matters how much he mined before it was available to the public. That is where the difference lies.

Well, seems as obvious as "$20k is not the top, we're going to $100k!" 9 months ago.

4977 2018-08-20 13:56:49 2/ The SEC is deeply motivated by investor protection, it is unlikely they will comprehensively declare any popular crypto asset a security because that would deeply hurt the very investors they are out to protect.

4996 2018-08-20 13:55:04 This is more prevalent for the OG’s of $BTC whereby they cannot lose from investing in the founding coin of crypto.
Accumulating more wealth over time is very substantial from a 20k down to a 6k market and probably lower, especially with alts what lose most value.
4997 2018-08-20 13:55:03 People making decentralized apps that mimic or copy what we have been using for 10 years plus is fools gold . You cannot replace an original with a counterfeit no matter how secure or decentralized it may be. #dapps #dapp #blockchain #disrupt #crypto

There are more ways of doing it than crypto. 

Several streams of passive income come together to form a river.

Remember how I said $300 a day will bring you 6 figures?

Find 3 $100 a day sources and live life.

5023 2018-08-20 13:52:19 It won't only be resisted by incumbent governemnts - it will be resisted by the every day man and woman who for their entire lives have been using their normal, traditional form of money & do not fully understand any of this crypto stuff or its benefits or flaws. Initially, a.l.
5024 2018-08-20 13:52:14 there's no evidence that starting an ICO and claiming it's for energy credits - rather than speculating on tokens - has achieved anything.

anyone can make up hypotheticals. crypto's present-day observable energy waste is real.
5025 2018-08-20 13:52:08 What's important is can anyone prove how many BTC Satoshi mined and owns?  If you cant, then how can you justifiably say Ripple owning 60b XRP is bad/greedy. Show me proof how many Satoshi owns. Otherwise it's an opinionated argument.  Ripple is transparent. Satoshi is a ghost
5026 2018-08-20 13:51:55 His purity doesn’t make automatically XRP dirty. I give Satoshi credit for what he did and achieve, but man, don’t undermine serious company trying to solve serious problem of making money moving faster and cheaper. You have no grounds to attack and FUD against Ripple and XRP.

5031 2018-08-20 13:51:31 Crazy theory: Traditional markets continue a bull run for the next 6-9 months and crypto sees the beginnings of a new bull run before this year is out. I may be too contrarian but way too many people out there are bearish on both.

5040 2018-08-20 13:50:07 FXP can be used as a great hedging opportunity in a situation of high
market volatility. Crypto investors can easily swap their crypto for a more stable fiat alternative,until the market has stabilized.

5041 2018-08-20 13:50:06 Dude, you got to break in. Behind that door is 2,6 billion dollars in bank notes and coins. You see people form all over the world put money in envelopes and send if there so bitfinex can send them back Tether, they then use the Tether to buy crypto. That's easier to buy direct.
5042 2018-08-20 13:50:05 Masternode hosting platforms do not hold your coins. You link your local wallet to the hosting platform and your masternode rewards are sent to your wallet. You always have control of all your coins.

5052 2018-08-20 13:48:34 There is so much mystery around BTC. Imagine serious investors, VCs, where they will most likely invest? In crypto with no founder and business plan, or cheaper, faster crypto product with clear plan for utilization? VCs are not stupid, they bet on people, not ghost stories.
5053 2018-08-20 13:48:30 Pour moi cette crypto est une Merde oui, pas parce que son cours baisse car toute les crypto ont baissé, je continue à acheter du $ICX malgré la baisse de 95% depuis janvier, mais parce que $TRX est derrière.

1. Buy $USDT @ ₹72.10 on WazirX P2P (ZERO FEE)
2. Then go to the USDT Market
3. Buy $BTC @ 6391 USDT
4. Effective INR price on WazirX = ₹4,60,790 #SabseSasta
5071 2018-08-20 13:45:03 It's a good ICO believe me. Will be worth the same price as ETH. @hilobrain created it. Only thing you have to do to get the airdrop? Post 10 rocket emojis & retweet & sign fake KYC.

5082 2018-08-20 13:43:33 I agree with you it shouldn't be a chunk, but given the drivers behind #Crypto and the low structural correlation they imply to the rest of the asset classes, I think warrants an allocation to crypto. Though I think this should be a small one 1-5% depending on your risk apetite
5083 2018-08-20 13:43:26 If they’re being so hostile it’s because they’re hurting and likely bought the top. There’s no reason to be hostile in crypto

5146 2018-08-20 13:34:42 Notice this only talks about energy. Mining requires structures, supply chain, and tech resources too. We have to realize that bitcoin is serving a tiny fraction of the global pop. These reports need to do a better job of comparing full systems, not just stating facts about one.
5147 2018-08-20 13:34:26 Ok today we play later, deal?
5148 2018-08-20 13:34:17 Yes, slightly different routes, but you are claiming that BTC route is pure while XRP route is greed. And that part is utter nonsense. XRP is a product, out there on the market, the value comes from utility. In beginning was somewhat centralized but that is not the case anymore.
5149 2018-08-20 13:34:10 哲平ちゃん、うちの自治体にも来てください。
5150 2018-08-20 13:33:58 Again you are on the wrong point. He made it public, and at the time it went public there was 700 BTC mined (last I checked, I could be wrong). That means after the 700, anybody had the fair chance to use their electricity resources to mine for themselves. But 700x0c = 0c

5155 2018-08-20 13:33:43 I’m also in a few of these, mainly $aro. I reallllllyy like $drip @DRIP_crypto and I don’t see anyone talking about it. It’s a PIVX fork. In Q4 they’ll be implementing something called “spend as btc” which looks interesting. Masternodes are dirt cheap right now.
5156 2018-08-20 13:33:40 Hard to say, I have a bunch of such "best cryptos" practically :) From top 20 cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin I would probably name NEM, Stellar and EOS. What about your best crypto(s)?

5176 2018-08-20 13:31:34 It is common, in crypto especially, to use the BTC volatility as a sort of get out of jail free card or a bail out from a bad trade. When they enter a losing position instead of using a stop they just DCA or average down the loser. This is not the time to be cute like that imo

5268 2018-08-20 13:23:08 We know when he made the project public, and which blocks were mined at that time. He mined 700 BTC during his initiation and of POW protocol.

5335 2018-08-20 13:17:25 basically there is no formula, just because $xrp has a lot of usecases doesnt mean only the usecases matter - bitcoin also has a value without these usecases, many other coins too - add speculation, add future usecases, add market growth of crypto adoption, raising demand..

5354 2018-08-20 13:13:03 Time flies much more faster in crypto than everywhere else. That's why it's so important to be in touch with everything new. A week earlier I made sure of my words cause of this ICO-project. That's actually sweet! Turn your attention to this #ico #sunxcoin #sunxcointoken

5358 2018-08-20 13:12:45 Absolutely! I dont think the IMF speaks at random. Just because a baby cries while their teeth come in doesn't mean the baby is dying. To me that is crypto at the moment...much growth still to come and perhaps some pain along the way but this thing will turn into an adult.

5363 2018-08-20 13:12:15 Good man. Every crypto new guy (circa 2017) I’ve spoken to have once been frothing about #xrp. These folks are now facing dire straights... (I know, not entirely #xrp fault, should have studied up a bit on basic risk-reward dynamics). All because CT said $10 by EoY
5364 2018-08-20 13:12:01 I hope they also sign up CBOE & CME manipulators in BTC so that the @SEC_News slackers also do the same with penny stocks.
5365 2018-08-20 13:11:49 so when it’s reported that the suicide rate has risen 25% nationwide since 1999, we should just assume today that it’s because of the “current crypto correction?” Definitely nothing to do with psychosis medication, debt or general degradation of our country

5394 2018-08-20 13:07:45 it would change too much during bank adoption, but besides @ripple, you also have @coil, @omni - and those usecases would increase the volumes immensely, encourage people to hold $XRP for daily usage on renting, browsing, entertainment

5399 2018-08-20 13:06:36 Well, I don’t think so. Mainly cause crypto currently, is about little else than speculation.. and the hype, has passed #xrp. With that being said, I’d probably be okey with “missing the train” with #xrp cause the risk-reward balance, for me, doesn’t favour the token.

5405 2018-08-20 13:05:59 So I asked you to give a pretty reasonable, very simple goal for proving blockchain is more useful than a straw hair bobble.

Are there any instances where blockchain technology is superior to already existing technology outside of actual crypto trading?

You could short it already , but if you are margin trading a small upswing can liquidated you before it falls and there is a chance that the news will be positive of course.

Cat: B-Day Jul 23 - Aug 22
Cats are inclined to buy the dip of dying crypto projects in hopes of gaining from a dead cat bounce. Even a dead cat will bounce up one last time before it’s final dirt nap. These guys don’t pussyfoot around.

5445 2018-08-20 13:00:30 Crypto is the ultimate game of conviction. Most of the best investment opportunities are non-obvious. They require independent thinking, discipline, and the courage to act alone. Those that do will be rewarded handsomely. -quoted from APompliano

5460 2018-08-20 12:59:20 That's why the central banks are funding finance corps to do the "crypto bubble" speculation and price manipulation
They already printed more FIAT and continue to spend it depressing #Bitcoin markets prices and scaring investors...
5461 2018-08-20 12:58:43 Agreed 100 Percent, just not this etf or this week but definitely down the road.  I’m guessing the CBOE has the best framework and will be approved eoy or beginning 2019.
5462 2018-08-20 12:58:43 但し、あの中は他言無用
5463 2018-08-20 12:58:38 I didn’t I was telling you two to go and buy because you were whining that BTC wasn’t going down and to get you out of my hair I told you to go ahead and buy. This way you can stop complaining. Most people aren’t happy until they are holding bags.
5464 2018-08-20 12:58:34 The one on the 23rd is futures backed ETF. An approval would be a first step in achieving their goal of 'doing something' with the limited supply of BTC.

5470 2018-08-20 12:57:57 ok, i understand and agree on al that, but does the concept formula for value per unit I came up with seems correct and complete to you?
5471 2018-08-20 12:57:42 His analyses starts in 2017 but crypto bull market started in Jan 2015 for Bitcoin and Jan 2016 for alts, of which Ethereum was indeed the leader.
5472 2018-08-20 12:57:32 But one group seems stuck seeing crypto valued in fiat, while the other group sees fiat as the plague, and are eager for the day when fiat is wiped out by crypto. I'm in the latter group.

5502 2018-08-20 12:53:43 Of course. If you want to buy some now with the understanding that its going to drop and you can buy more cheaper then there is nothing wrong with that. That means your an investor. As long as you don’t sell when it drops again like most do. Your scaling in on they way down.

5524 2018-08-20 12:50:13 People behind XRP have build a product, infrastructure, community and put the price on that product. People bought it because they saw the value. This is how every business out there works, it’s core principle of capitalism, which obviously bothers you.
5525 2018-08-20 12:50:12 So true. I have never felt as much negativity in a community before. People should focus on the positive sides, there's opportunities for every single individual. Ones success should not seen as reason for jealousy but as a good example and inspiration.
5526 2018-08-20 12:50:09 Seriously dude, you obviously know nothing how #Ripple started! In any case, I bought xrp at my own peril and it is my money to spend on whatever crypto I want! What crypto do you like?

5530 2018-08-20 12:49:49 All I am saying is your approach is causing divisiveness. Crypto adoption won't increase if people see words like scam, fraud, etc, being thrown around with reckless abandon without evidence, the entire space looks like kids fighting over their toys.

5538 2018-08-20 12:47:37 I think XRP is E-coin from Mr. Robot.  From what I've seen, it was highly polished upon launch, like Apple to Bitcoin's Linux.  I've always considered it Google's secret crypto-fiat, and while that may be off...thats because the developers were all coming straight from Google.

5573 2018-08-20 12:43:23 They sold their XRP for some ridiculous price, way below 1 cent, those who bought it got rich. Value of the token can be measured by infrastructure, community and utility, XRP has it all. You don’t have issue with XRP, essentially you have issue with capitalism.

5690 2018-08-20 12:27:33 I'm not arguing. I'm simply asking a question. You claim Satoshi had no idea it would get this big. How do you know this?  Did he tell someone this?  I was under the impression he was an unknown sole. Its that's the case, would that mean you are basically creating the story?

5820 2018-08-20 12:07:52 FXP can be used as a  great  hedging  opportunity  in  a  situation  of  high  
market volatility. Crypto investors can easily swap their crypto for a more stable fiat alternative, until the market has stabilize

5842 2018-08-20 12:03:27 higher volume results in more distribution, higher distribution means lower available supply on the spread, new owners tend to not sell untill a certain price is met, the volume is based on a transaction value, so it needs to match this.

5868 2018-08-20 12:00:39 $DGB is 5X+ more decentralized and uses 5 hashing algorithms instead of 1 centralized algo. Just saying, isn't the whole point of crypto the decentralization and security from 51% attacks? What am I missing here?

5887 2018-08-20 11:56:19 Here's an idea to encourage crypto mass adoption - easier addresses.

I want to see something like BTCmyaddress, LTCmyaddress.

Any devs up for a challenge?

5897 2018-08-20 11:54:39 Is it 20k btc? Exchanges usually show btc amount, not fiat
5898 2018-08-20 11:54:34 Bcash is a scam.

Beware what you buy.

Fake coins like $BCH or originals like $BTC #Bitcoin.

5904 2018-08-20 11:52:57 It’s becoming really clear to me people in the crypto space don’t like hearing things that are not constantly bullish. Sad because by having perspective of this, you can be end holding more crypto and supporting it more in the long term. /1

5917 2018-08-20 11:51:21 Putting a big chunk into any singular asset is terrible advice not just crypto. Telling people to completely avoid an asset class altogether because of personal bias is just as bad, if not worse.

I could blame the "bear market" like everyone else. I made some silly investments the last 7 months.

Blame is on me :(
5974 2018-08-20 11:40:33 That mentality is why the 20 something’s you speak of don’t have money to invest. Crypto as a part of a diversified portfolio is not an issue at all. Don’t pollute people’s brains with your lack of expertise on not only crypto but investing as a whole.

6145 2018-08-20 11:12:16 好棒！
6146 2018-08-20 11:12:06 They say 90% of crypto will be "wiped out" during this bear market?... 
There are at least 8 "survivors" of the 2014-2015 Bear market around today: 

1.$BTC     bottom was ≈$208  (new ATH $20,089  Dec 2017)
2.$DASH  bottom was ≈$1.68 (new ATH $1,642    Dec 2017)

6150 2018-08-20 11:11:41 Honestly I don't feel that at all...I see the community shrinking and outside people just don't care about crypto, in fact most of the people that were curious about this tech and asked me about crypto are now looking at it like a scam and don't want nothing with it anymore.
6151 2018-08-20 11:11:27 Keep up the crypto movement! We are supporters of UTRUST, trying to help the adoption of crypto, check us out!
6152 2018-08-20 11:11:16 Yes I agree. I feel the market has been moving sideways for almost 2 weeks waiting for major movements based upon this ETF decision which is most likely a rejection. Although not a significant ETF, but we know how the market reacted to the rejection of Winkleovss ETF

6223 2018-08-20 10:58:52 Yes it’s true from the get go doubters doubted now they watch as #tron blazes past each deadline they set buy far the best team in crypto no offense to others hard work but Tron is special and on a scale beyond.  How anyone not seeing the investment potential here is crazy. 
6224 2018-08-20 10:58:49 While crypto is low and stable it makes sense to take the time to learn how to buy real coins in your own wallet and spread buys across the restrictive weekly buying limits. Then during the next wave of crypto hype go back to eToro again for the big trades.
6225 2018-08-20 10:58:48 I am 99% certain their cost budget was not based on $8B in revenues. The price of crypto is unpredictable.

6227 2018-08-20 10:58:30 I often compare crypto with oil. Oil in the ground has no value. Hire engineers, machinery, drill it out, pack it, brand it, find customers and suddenly this oil has value. Tokens on their own are worthless. Ripple created infrastructure, community and utility, hence the value.
6228 2018-08-20 10:58:19 How often are trx rewards paid out?
6229 2018-08-20 10:57:59 If you buy high then yea it’s a shit holding it through 50-90% declines. But if you buy low, no problem holding it as a long term asset

Setting up merchants to accept crypto isn’t the best path to adoption. 

Letting people experience and use crypto is. As more people use it, more will begin to accept it & adoption will swell.

6465 2018-08-20 10:18:46 For example, some central banks:
-don’t pay IORR nor IOER;
-pay IORR and/or IOER;
-pay NIORR and/or NIOER;
-don’t have a required reserve ratio altogether.

Maybe there could be a secondary supply that adjusts for each of these varying (sometimes unconventional) policy decisions?
6466 2018-08-20 10:18:35 そもそも #XRP のチャート見ればわかるけど価格水準では非線形性をもってるよね。。。そこに線形のトレンドライン引いていいの？

6468 2018-08-20 10:18:19 Mr. Kitao also stated ‘I’d like to say “Wait a little bit.” for banks using xRapid.’ .

Basically because xRapid is too good compare with what banks can do to send money. To protect banks.

6474 2018-08-20 10:17:22 Yes, completely agree with you that IOR causes theoretical problems for base money supply’s definition. When I said “avoided demand-side...,” I just meant the above analysis doesn’t take into account how commercial banks might react to unconventional policy decisions like IOR.

Its a trade (buy/sell) the sellers of xrp have 30m in $ to split, and there are 30m $ of new 'holders'. they determine when to buy/sell their next part for a profit, so selling price moves up

6576 2018-08-20 09:59:00 idealy the spread is thick to keep the price stable, but the spread will mutate more frequently, if new orders do not come in constantly, price moves, once people see a price up movement they might move up their selling targets and adjust buy targets

6578 2018-08-20 09:57:21 Do you think it's good for crypto as a whole refering to other projects as "shitcoins"? Will that encourage mass adoption? If you don't like a certain project then don't invest and keep your mouth shut. Do you want to make money or not?

6580 2018-08-20 09:56:51 if every person that buys crypto aims to sell it for more than he bought it for, which is basically the thoughts behind an investment, having an increase in volume due to orders being filled the result would be an upwards movement in price - as it changes owners more frequently

Because the founder became the richest man in the world overnight due to how many Ripple tokens he printed for himself. Nothing in ripple or whatever you call it this week, is real.

6714 2018-08-20 09:35:07 BittrrexでXRPの取り扱いにしたがい流動性が増加。
なぜ流動性が高まると価格上昇が期待されるのか。
それは流動性増加により換金性が高まるという付加価値が付くからです。
金融的には保有することによるリスクが低下するのです。

 4. Operate site until you get people's trust and they start to hold all their crypto on it.
 5. Shut down site

7014 2018-08-20 08:49:21 Agreed. In crypto, if X causes Y, later when X2 comes along, instead of Y2 we generally get not-Y; sometimes even the opposite of Y. Think of bitcoin forks; coinbase adding coins.... then ETC; & BTC runs crippling alts.... then stopping. Past doesn’t always predict future here.

7068 2018-08-20 08:38:59 No cap would be great, and ideal, but @a3456gf is right. Lifting the limit in itself doesn't show BCH is serious about business and shouldn't be a goal, but rather a means. Let market adoption grow and blocks will start growing.

7074 2018-08-20 08:38:11 That's not how that signal works? I used Haasbot and from what I remember that signal would have made the bot sell at 6420. It is not an :early warning: when the price keeps pumpin for almost $200 to the top later. If it was on leverage, it would be short from 6420.

実は本当は、もっと面白い寄り道のチャンスがいっぱいあったのに、
他のことに目も行かず、手を出さずに見逃してしまうと
結果どちらも手に入らない、ということになりかねませんよね。
7207 2018-08-20 08:11:44 だから、どう生きたいか？を考えて、
時間を過去から未来に向かって
物事を進めていくのが普通だと思いますが
　
死ぬときどうありたいか？と
時間を未来から過去に
逆算して考える『逆算思考』も一つの考え方として
理にかなっている、と思います。

7210 2018-08-20 08:11:32 ちょっと振り返れば
別の道に気がつくかもしれないし、
勝手に輝いていたゴールが、
本当の意味で輝いているとは限らないのです。

7212 2018-08-20 08:11:24 目標を掲げて、夢を追うのも
もちろん良いのですが、
あまりそっちに目が行き過ぎ
こだわり過ぎると
　
道端に他のいいチャンスが転がっているのにも
気が付かなくなってしまうので、
足元に転がっているチャンスを
見逃さないで欲しいとも思っているわけです。

7214 2018-08-20 08:11:14 Maybe wrong, but aren't only the funds in a form of online wallet/exchange available to the ledgers pathfinding mechanism? What would be the reason for the HODLers to take their offline savings 'online'? Thus, i see only limited part of the supply to be available for transactions
7215 2018-08-20 08:11:14 今、ユーチューバーで成功した人も

「好きなことで生きていく」と言っていますが、
　
これだって最初からあったわけでなく
YouTuberという言葉が生まれたのが
最近になってからなわけなので
7218 2018-08-20 08:10:53 Müthiş.
7219 2018-08-20 08:10:41 So they won't notice there donated trx amongst the thousands of other tweets they receive daily. We need a couple of public stunts to hit headlines and mainstream media news outlets etc to get said celebrities to check for donations
7220 2018-08-20 08:10:40 Are world currencies backed by transatlantic flight?? If we're comparing apples and oranges, gold and Bitcoin are closer than burgers or toothpicks.

You do know gold is actually used as a store of value by few people worldwide, right?
7221 2018-08-20 08:10:40 例え、勝ち抜いて夢を手に入れたとしても、
必ずしも良い結果であるとは限らなかったり、
　
逆に、まったく興味なかったことや関係ないことが

7224 2018-08-20 08:10:30 しかし、だんだんと気が付くわけですよ。
　
大人たちは夢をあきらめて別の道で生きていく人も多く
夢がない人も、いっぱいいるし、目標や努力を掲げたって
そう上手く行かないのではないか？
という疑問に。
7225 2018-08-20 08:10:18 But how do we break with conviction and momentum if the speculators and investors have been shaken out? Which I believe they largely have.
It needs new money. Institutions are just waiting for completion of entry gateways and infrastructure.

7325 2018-08-20 07:51:39 Basically what you are saying is that higher speed will draw in more transaction volume and with no change in available supply, value per token needs to go up?

All of crypto is currently a waste of time in my opinion

There is still hope with bitcoincash

If it cannot emerge from propaganda shadow

It will have to be dash/doge for me

7343 2018-08-20 07:48:17 Will banks/FI’s give much consideration to the price of XRP?  Costs should be the same regardless if $500/XRP or $5/XRP, right? – just a matter of how many XRP they will need to fulfill the transfer…they’re still transferring the same amount of money.  @XRPTrump @OZCRYPTO2

7565 2018-08-20 07:04:44 RT APompliano: Investing boils down to two things:

1. Value you receive
2. Price you pay

Too many crypto investors are overpaying for things with no value.
7566 2018-08-20 07:04:43 Rule #1 for explaining/selling bitcoin to institutions: 

Never start with selling bitcoin, start with selling the concept of sound money 

Rule #2

Refer to point number 1 

#bitcoin
7567 2018-08-20 07:04:42 34/ Five - Trying to beat the timing game is risky business. Waiting for institutional money to lead the charge might leave you behind while the retail train leaves the station.
7568 2018-08-20 07:04:41 おでも出川組ｗ
7569 2018-08-20 07:04:41 33/ Four - In every previous #bitcoin bull cycle, increased access points that were created in the preceding “build” cycle added to the convenience and capacity for new capital to enter the market. I believe we are seeing this cycle repeat, and yet again in larger magnitude.
7570 2018-08-20 07:04:41 32/ Three - Major established financial institutions are already providing institutional-grade access to #bitcoin products to millions of clients across the world.
7571 2018-08-20 07:04:40 31/  Two - 99m ppl in Western economies alone are estimated to be seeking exposure to #crypto. If each put £100 into #bitcoin at current prices, that equates to demand for ~1.9 million bitcoins, or more than 10% of minted supply.

Records and diaries have been destroyed or manipulated.

7588 2018-08-20 07:03:36 can't help but think it has to do with everyone overtrading. Not saying one way or the other, but simply that the entirely of crypto right now is impatient. The big run up last year would have made you more monies and been less stressful than trying to trade this market.

7603 2018-08-20 07:01:46 Mr. Kofi Annan’s significant contribution to the MDGs will always be remembered. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this hour of grief. May his soul rest in peace.
7604 2018-08-20 07:01:45 We express our profound sorrow at the passing away of Nobel Laureate and former UNSG Mr. Kofi Annan. The world has lost not only a great African diplomat and humanitarian but also a conscience keeper of international peace and security.

7787 2018-08-20 06:27:37 I believe #crypto will nicely sync with economic collapse, that I expect in 1-2 years. In the meantime crypto will mature a bit we will get rid of $USDT fake ICO's and we will already have some use cases/working products. Time after collapse will be time for $crypto mass adoption

7819 2018-08-20 06:19:06 Gisteren op een verjaardag had ik ook een gesprek over crypto. Het voelde nog aan alsof we in 2015 zaten qua kennisniveau. 

Wat moeten we met crypto? Wacht maar totdat al dat gedrukte QR geld tot inflatie leidt. Dat banken mijn spaargeld tot 30x kunnen uitlenen klopt ook niet.

And, crying foul over Crypto conferences? How about STEMM or Entertainment events in CA?

7836 2018-08-20 06:16:16 So wouldn't that also indicate Q3-4 are going to comp even worse? Demand from crypto ramped in the late summer/early fall and peaked in winter. Sector rotation out of tech will be in full force by then. Near to intermediate-term are just as important, ESPECIALLY in evolving tech.

7850 2018-08-20 06:13:53 I talk about #crypto, some people agree, some people don’t. 

#crypto is divisive for one reason, it disrupts one of the last strongholds of the centrally governed world. MONEY.

7888 2018-08-20 06:05:58 (Right now, I think sending crypto is more expensive for most users - when you include cost of learning a new UI, cost of currency risk, regulatory/compliance cost. But same as email - it took decades of development before email became cheaper for most users)
7889 2018-08-20 06:05:53 Short term and long markets don’t rise forever, they don’t fall forever either! Rather be chasing more crypto on the way down, than trying to chase it on the way up!! Bitcoin to minimum $100,000 just a matter of when!

1. he did not say it implicitly but neither did he deny it
2. he did reply to others comments regarding crypto
3. If it was not for crypto, why he replied it?
3. So I think it looks like my case is stronger?

7920 2018-08-20 05:56:16 Agree ,but you NORMALLY like speed fud and bad news about OCN.
7921 2018-08-20 05:55:44 The company creates a portfolio fund manager for all investors or traditional online traders who can easily move into a block, and crypto investors can use all their financial resources on a single platform and receive their investments #Bitbose #BOSE
7922 2018-08-20 05:55:26 I’ll watch for power ledger. I’m a hardcore cynic of late thanks to crypto. I would love to be wrong for once, but I’m seeing nothing but faked WEF connections & catch-phrase marketing fluff as I look into it. All the best.

7980 2018-08-20 05:37:56 I didn’t forget, I’ve just NEVER heard of this @HorizonState until you told me just now. Unfortunately me not knowing of a crypto is the first ‘shitcoin’ red flag.
7981 2018-08-20 05:37:41 Pay very close attention to the popular Crypto companies & you will see they ALL are promoting their blockchain. If one pays attention they all want to have integrated blockchains so any token can travel along through the system. Companies I mentioned are bummers due to dilution.
7982 2018-08-20 05:37:32 Cloud computing: "someone else's computer". You don't control it, and someone else can raise the price or kick you off, any time.

Common computing: "our computer". Crypto-enabled platforms based on common ownership and agreed rules.

Fuck the cloud. #ipfs #truebit
7983 2018-08-20 05:37:31 @BeacherGrrl +1 @xrptipbot Still wondering if you are for real?  Here is an XRP crypto to get you started in crypto.... @AlanEspasandin

7985 2018-08-20 05:36:52 だから、運転免許証から本籍(国籍)の項目を非表示にしてはいけなかったのだ。
7986 2018-08-20 05:36:52 It would be even harder to explain to someone deep into crypto, but not into gambling.
7987 2018-08-20 05:36:36 Anyone who has interacted with a crypto exchange platform can bare me witness that it is nearly impossible to transact large volumes. This restricts big traders who are allowed to trade upto $ 50,000 USD a day depending on what platform they are using
7988 2018-08-20 05:36:35 Of Course no volume Yet,give it time...And you are Always waiting bad thing about OCN and creating Fud

8001 2018-08-20 05:31:56 Here is what I am learning (if your interested), Most popular cryptos getting all the digital print are not promoting their crypto. XLM, XRP, OMG, ADA all of these crypto's promote blockchain projects that will not require users of their  blockchain to use their Token.
8002 2018-08-20 05:31:24 we've known that bitcoin and bitcoin-likes were expanding exponentially to consume all the earth's remaining power resources for years and all companies did was expand into crypto

8025 2018-08-20 05:25:10 Incorrect. You must be new to crypto. The selling point of ripple is that it is centralized and fast. That’s literally the words out of ripple creators mouths. Stop peddling your fraudulent information.
8026 2018-08-20 05:25:02 What could be really funny is if SEC will decline the ETF proposals (especially the one from CBOE), but the price of #bitcoin will surge as crazy! At least after all who got immediately panicked will sell the rest of their coins.

8047 2018-08-20 05:19:20 He didn't "keep" any, he mined then, anyone else could have too. Ripple literally made tokens & kept a heap. The other thing also is Satoshi had no idea BTC would get this big, and it seems that that is also the reason why he disappeared. Either way XRP knew what they were doing

5. You asked for help which shows great strength and a willingness to change. This is your first step.

8123 2018-08-20 05:03:19 @CashApp you guys should implement a feature like Coinbase has where I can set up automatic daily/weekly/monthly Bitcoin purchases for a set amount. I’d move strictly to your service for crypto if you added that feature. #Bitcoin #Crypto #cashapp @jack

8170 2018-08-20 04:53:06 There are various causes, though the real question is what keeps people there. A big thing that traps people is a lack of purpose and hope. Give people genuine hope, and the equal opportunity to find and fulfill their purpose, and you'll find true wealth redistribution.

8250 2018-08-20 04:35:01 The public does not believe in it anymore, only the ones that stuck with it. Hell, even traders don't care anymore. How would that change? Unlikely that crypto gets super bullish then tanks when the public leaves it...never heard of a story like that where it goes bullish again

Thus reducing hierarchy.

Whether or not he got paid out of it does not change that he's a victim and she's a predator.

8750 2018-08-20 02:30:50 Listen I'm sure you're a good kid, I'm sorry crypto will most likely never be regulated under a Republican, but did you really expect the world to let people start printing their own money? You need to start focusing more on economics and less on identity politics.
8751 2018-08-20 02:30:36 It's funny cuz TEL is one of my biggest bag... along with XRP. I'm just not as optimistic as you fanboys are. I guess that comes from my stocks trading experience and my background. But I sure hope TEL reaches 50$ one day... but let's begin by getting through this bear market 1st

8759 2018-08-20 02:29:10 Bitcoin (BTC) continued to seesaw over the weekend, moving between the $6,300 and $6,500 trading range. Traders were content on playing the range, as they wait on news or catalysts that may move the crypto markets.
8760 2018-08-20 02:29:00 Why, you’d prefer if there were more accusers? I hope to God there aren’t.

8783 2018-08-20 02:23:12 I think it's the whole private company inflation thing that people don't like. It's pretty much anti crypto ethos imho. But those are some really great stats, I can see where Enterprise would want to participate on that chain.

8866 2018-08-20 02:04:23 え、ええ〜
8867 2018-08-20 02:04:05 Obviously what this girl did was crazy and your explaination makes sense but would you agree that guy is a scumbag? Looked through that thread and it's a whole bunch of drama.
8868 2018-08-20 02:03:46 Volume profile doesn’t quite match a h/s, and isn’t a h/s more of s reversal pattern 
8869 2018-08-20 02:03:29 my thought is, it doesn't matter which

most crypto investors, because they know literally nothing about legacy markets, will just see "ETF rejection"

It won't be the CBOE ETF, but they will have no idea how to distinguish between the two
8870 2018-08-20 02:03:17 FYI: I am fully expecting an April like rally where everything goes up, #Bitcoin $BTC along with $alts

Strong emotions of any kind, means you have a weak hand, it’s grandstanding and no comment or what is presume to be weak by being poised is actually a strong hand the holder just thinking about all risk scenarios, Confidence

8966 2018-08-20 01:45:18 Friction still doesn't tend to zero, arguably this means the equilibrium scale of 'firms' will be smaller. Professional collectives (bot, human or both) and other communities coordinating via 'crypto-networks' may to varying degrees fill this niche.
8967 2018-08-20 01:45:16 I don’t disagree... it wasn’t entirely where I was going with my question though. I was thinking more along the lines of a crypto fiat currency being able to provide continuous and instant feedback about productivity to dictate its expansion

8970 2018-08-20 01:45:00 ETFs are not going to be approved. We should just move on. Plus, SEC will be risking a lawsuit if they approve one, considering the last rejection was recent.

Crypto doesn't need Retail. Retail needs Crypto.

8973 2018-08-20 01:43:58 so few people actually know what's going on. this market has a tendency to overreact to irrelevant news. Remember the Winkelvii's appeal rejection a few weeks back? Killed the last rally.

8976 2018-08-20 01:42:49 Nobody cares about that ETF and nobody expects it to be accepted.  But definitely worth watching nonetheless.
8977 2018-08-20 01:42:44 Let crypto get regulated once and I will sue Zee TV saying it tried decreasing the price of Bitcoin.

9020 2018-08-20 01:33:10 Blockchain optimally might infect every device on the internet with scads of useless proof of transactions the vast, vastly vast, majority of even crypto users don't give a damn about. That is, if it doesn't devour energy grids by mining, an obscene waste of power. Flawed design.

9038 2018-08-20 01:28:02 I agree with you. But still wondering about bitmex leverage, if bitmex has an interest itself in not letting the expected charts happen and end up having more longs on leverage than usual. They prob don't want too many longs riding it long term on leverage

Over half of every move occurs in the first 1 minute candle. Stoplosses are a recipe for disaster. eToro disabled stops recently due to slippage!

If you're swing trading a month at a time -- crypto probably can't be beat.

9266 2018-08-20 00:35:20 y'all bitcoin nerds seem to be able to understand proof of work as related to crypto, but can't seem to apply that concept to commodities, in general.
9267 2018-08-20 00:35:13 So easy to let things get out of perspective in #crypto.  

When I consider the amount of money at stake, it’s crazy to think I’ve been too much of a cheap ass to buy TV pro.

Same can be said for those who put off buying a ledger/trezor 

Don’t be dumb people, this shit is real

9290 2018-08-20 00:28:02 l have found crypto twitter less toxic then FB or reddit.
9291 2018-08-20 00:28:00 the coming couple weeks will offer the entry point people will be envious for in 2019  $btc #crypto
9292 2018-08-20 00:27:43 We can not have mass adoption of crypto if half of the world's population is not currently in crypto.
9293 2018-08-20 00:26:31 Waiting on ETC to hit $14 again so I can get out of crypto and stop wasting money
9294 2018-08-20 00:26:30 Let the mass adoption commence!
9295 2018-08-20 00:26:12 I have used this alt bear to learn forex trading (my path was shares>CFDs>crypto>forex). It has improved my discernment and skills immeasurably. My passion for crypto projects got in the way of taking profits when they were on offer - something I never had trouble with in shares.
9296 2018-08-20 00:25:58 I hope so, a bit worried about Russian mob threats though

9297 2018-08-20 00:25:56 So true!

9303 2018-08-20 00:24:40 I love how the first shoutout is a woman in crypto shouting out another woman in crypto 
9304 2018-08-20 00:24:25 How could i join? 
9305 2018-08-20 00:23:34 
9306 2018-08-20 00:23:22 Thanks for your feedback! I own some myself since January this year, I believe in it also. I think to push this to the next level and help us retire early, we need more mainstream mentions on the big news channels. A lot of people are still asking..."what is bitcoin" or crypto
9307 2018-08-20 00:23:19 “There will be ETFs for both BTC and ETH sometime in 2019. When that happens, the underlying coin prices will explode and the crypto market in general will take off big time” – Dr. Van Tharp

I miss the good days, it is the so called "adoption" ?

9313 2018-08-20 00:20:49 Am I an honest person in crypto?
9314 2018-08-20 00:20:38 At the moment, yes.
9315 2018-08-20 00:20:35 I see it as an investment someone will bite and repost

9317 2018-08-20 00:19:53 cant believe people really believe that china actually has a crypto index.. those who do, know nothing about china and its stance on crypto.. 
Just because there are some chinese words on it, it makes it chinas crypto index? if yes, who puts it together?
9318 2018-08-20 00:19:31 Have you seen this tweet about some crypto wallet tho
9319 2018-08-20 00:19:16 The fact XRP has such a large market cap and ranking goes to show how much complete stupidity there is in the crypto market. We could go down much, much further until we weed out the morons.
9320 2018-08-20 00:18:51 This is a mandela effect because I always saw that he called himself crypto knight. 
9321 2018-08-20 00:18:49 #Btc $btc #Crypto $Crypto #Xrp $xrp The biggest double standard from Bitcoin max’ists is that although they want to do away with fiat, they are more than happy to ‘value’ it in fiat. #bch $bch

9324 2018-08-20 00:18:38 Doesn't matter what you see in an $eth chart or any other chart - #followthemoney - if you have to chart something the only one that would matter N #crypto is the $btc #bitcoin chart.  They all follow it.  #cryptocurrency - unless your looking for a quick flip.
9325 2018-08-20 00:18:25 So happy my house finally settled. So glad I made the tough choice to sell. Locked in my future not having to panic around crypto can now ride that shit to 0 knowing it wont impact my financial wellbeing if it does.
9326 2018-08-20 00:18:16 Gonna keep my eye on $DRGN with gains like 14.61% in past hour #Cryptocurrency #Crypto #blockchain #altcoin #cryptolife #bitcointalk #decentralized
9327 2018-08-20 00:18:02 So you got into crypto full time in December 2017. That explains a lot. Nothing wrong with a secondary account with Twitter though, that doesn't make you fraud.
9328 2018-08-20 00:17:44 True, if you ask around there are for real people that thought that being down a 90% they only needed a +90% to break even and after that it was all profit.
They need a +900% only to break even. Long story short most of them will never ever see their money back or make a profit
9329 2018-08-20 00:17:29 Big thanks to the @CryptoCoinCon team for putting on an informative and inspiring #crypto convention in #philly yesterday! I had a ton of fun speaking and learned a ton from all the great speakers.
9330 2018-08-20 00:17:22 I am not sure how out of times that gap makes me.

I don't even know if we're out of the crypto mining nightmare

9346 2018-08-20 00:15:28 Before the bull market in crypto starts running it’s going to shake off as many speculators and investors as possible. That’s just what bull markets do. Either we break above $6800 with conviction or we break down to 4K.

9350 2018-08-20 00:14:59 Think about how many People you know that even know or heard of bitcoin ? Honestly on my end Not many can you even send bitcoin to them ? Imo the more People that know about it the better chance of Mass Adoption exspecialy to the Content creators of the World

9353 2018-08-20 00:14:22 Ever since I pulled my head out of crypto and CT, moving back to forex. Things really have changed not only in my profitability but in my well-being. Maybe there really is a weird subconscious associated with #crypto and #btc. Feel free to discuss.
