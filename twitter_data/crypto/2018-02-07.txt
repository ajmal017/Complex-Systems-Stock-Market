1 2018-02-07 23:59:51 It’s eerie to me how the stock market and crypto market are in-sync during the sell off #cryptobubble #stockmarketbubble
2 2018-02-07 23:59:30 thanks for asking! i just bought a t-shirt about being in crypto so i can talk about being in crypto while being in crypto
3 2018-02-07 23:59:25 Not sure in this environment that infighting is the best strategy? Goal would be that consumers can choose all products and they work with each other 
1+1 = 11
No free passes for any crypto ?

13 2018-02-07 23:58:26 Can’t post proof of my conversation. Not sure why you would want proof of my account other than for dubious reasons. The bank was Mutual of Omaha but BOA wouldn’t even open my account knowing i invest in crypto.
