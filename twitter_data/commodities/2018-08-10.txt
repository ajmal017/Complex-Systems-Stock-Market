15 2018-08-12 22:03:25 Definitely racist. But it’s also a product of how these movies were marketed when they were originally exported to the West, as cheap, silly, throwaway commodities. A nice thing about the truly great movies though is that they almost always shut them up in the end.

Robert, it's a market to buy and sell commodities. No difference

Very naive in thinking Wall Street and Bankers can't handle this market

They already control this market or "realm" as you say. Realm of vaporware assets priced by speculation

61 2018-08-12 19:57:07 I read a meme showing the connection between capitalism and depression. We have an economic system that turned people into commodities. Support systems for psychological support are nonexistent. It's mental health crisis.
62 2018-08-12 19:48:12 That would be capitalism: there’s only capital for producing marketable commodities, not for producing everything useful.
63 2018-08-12 19:38:19 It's been a very tough year for food commodities, prices have been quite high and unfriendly to the pocket yet some deluded ones are lying about prices coming down across the Nation!

78 2018-08-12 18:28:18 It's a commodities economy. Its agric output has gone up since the sanctions, has quite a number of industries actually doing better cos of sanctions.
And its trade with China is in surplus, matter of fact its trade surpluses are impressive
79 2018-08-12 18:21:40 African lives dont matter. We are seen as commodities and cheap labour. Call them targeted sanctions or whatever but it is all a red herring. Just like the biological warfare, sanctions are a modern day weapon

85 2018-08-12 17:29:21 TODOS los gobiernos quieren que pensemos en pesos... Pues bien señores es simple. No aten nada a precio dólar. Basta de commodities. Basta de precios de barril de petróleo. Porque tengo que vender por ejemplo la soja al precio que indican extranjeros?

93 2018-08-12 16:50:15 PE firms don't have long term strategies; nor passion for the businesses they buy. Can't trade in companies as if they are commodities.

96 2018-08-12 16:36:23 The reality is we're all in the "process business". Except it isn't a business, it's a process. So we're in the "process process" but everyone is selling commodities. We don't even know what an event is. We expect everything to happen anyway. It's childish.
97 2018-08-12 16:25:13 I won't stick up for NT on this occasion, but you could say the same of many marketized commodities:  over-priced, they try to lock you in, they homogenise the product.  Maybe there's no magic (market) bullet?

102 2018-08-12 15:30:20 So how has this helped the economy in terms of prices of goods and commodities in Nigeria. It's on record that Nigeria has not suffered like this since independence. Even in the so called 16 years of PDP.  Has the looting of our economy stopped under Buhari.
103 2018-08-12 15:29:45 It's only going to take a very small % of gold commodities to foreign currency to bury the dollar. Trump is very tactical to force tariffs for free trade. Look around at all of these we buy gold stores and commercials. This is going to be the worst thing we've seen in America.
104 2018-08-12 15:13:35 That could be. I wouldn't put it past executives of any industry to treat people more like commodities than actual human beings.

106 2018-08-12 15:11:34 Nice! Fascinating how this is completely true for job hunting as well. Guess, this dull-homoganization has well thrived beyond commodities!
107 2018-08-12 15:06:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
108 2018-08-12 15:02:03 Arty is one of the few commodities that weighs out before cubing out, true. But I'm intrested in the consumption data, what's driving the requirement. That's not always easy to locate, and this (honestly) doesnt line up with other 660 TPD metrics I've seen, which is mostly fuel.
109 2018-08-12 15:00:14 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”

114 2018-08-12 14:15:55 The term you’re looking for is “commodity money”. You won’t communicate effectively if you use different definitions to everyone else. Fiat money literally is money “according to law” it has nothing to do with commodities.
115 2018-08-12 14:10:31 Fiat means “by law” it has literally nothing whatsoever to do with commodities. I don’t know how else anyone can make this clearer.
116 2018-08-12 14:09:32 It's so hard for us to change prices. We've killed the market by training customers to ask for discounts.
We have converted our great products that we invest so much in to ensure value & service, into mere commodities. 
Commodities were price is inelastic. 
117 2018-08-12 13:59:31 #Commodities  It's been incredibly difficult to make money in the commodity markets during the past 8 months.  Why?  Because 80% of all markets have been trading sideways.  2018 has been a brutal year for the CTA community.  Everybody getting chopped up.  #Commodities

Marx describes both money and commodities as part of a relationship, the movement of capital itself, more so than with property or wages per se.
125 2018-08-12 12:56:52 Marx, continues, "[M]oney itself is only one of the two forms of value. Unless it takes the form of some commodity, it does not become capital . . . The capitalist knows that all commodities, are in faith and in truth money . . .
126 2018-08-12 12:56:00 Confidence & Momentum are  underrated commodities, foundations on which success often hinges. Build up a healthy reserve of each & you’re on your path to crushing some of your goals. #Motivation #Success

130 2018-08-12 12:12:48 I think you can Gio.
Because you aren’t really taxing.

You can as govt, even carry the initial “float”, by fiat.

I’m talking about a revenue neutral thing here.

Done this way, there should be zero effect on prices of the commodities you mention.
131 2018-08-12 11:59:16 @Trader_Dante @AnthonyCrudele Traders don’t always want to divulge to much information. On those occasions when someone asks what do you do for a living? I say “as little as possible” #Forex #Stocks #Shares #Commodities
132 2018-08-12 11:43:31 If slavery was to happen again all over Africa I believe wih the present situation of society where money rules and our African leaders already see us as bare commodities... I think slavery would be a huge success if it happens again...
133 2018-08-12 11:31:38 The destruction of influence of unions, trade unions, worker cooperatives, worker rights has been the canary in the coal mine. This bird has been dying since the 1970s.

Without a voice for the working class, human beings have become commodities for corporations to abuse.
134 2018-08-12 11:10:32 1/ Clearly the USD is strong, putting enormous pressure on EEM currencies, the FXE and FXA, and the full gamut of commodities (GLD SLV DBA DBC), except UNG. In fact, energy USO is holding up reasonably well and nat gas has been ripping off a multi-week base.
135 2018-08-12 11:04:38 We don't want cryptos to be a part of payment ecosystem . Allowing it as commodities and educating youth about mining would have done wonders.

138 2018-08-12 10:25:10 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.

141 2018-08-12 09:43:05 So the days of essential commodities, alias essenco, are back in Kogi state? Hope it will not spill over to neighbouring sates. Oh those horrible years.
142 2018-08-12 09:08:41 You know nothing about  our country, we have lot of commodities & we have lot of economic activities that would economically emancipate our people. The head of state is greedy & should be held accountable.
143 2018-08-12 08:52:41 Of ideology, it's dearth in our land & polity is palpable. The buyers have none,  neither the "commodities", the platforms or the agents! Were they to have had,  not only would the drama be lesser,  it would hold as much appeal as toying with sand has to a 50year old!
144 2018-08-12 08:50:38 The EU uses tariffs to restrict the supply of a large number of basic commodities, such as foodstuffs. We can see part of this in terms of the tariff income. What is not analysed is the impact of higher prices paid particularly by the poorest.
145 2018-08-12 08:05:09 Is there not an element that oil and commodities are valued in Usd. So even if euro or yuan are fully convertible Usd would still have greater demand?

One that does a wide spread of currencies, stocks, commodities and FX.Thanks
148 2018-08-12 07:51:04 Oh what’s she’s selling now is air conditioners in China .. she got the trademark today under ‘Ivanka Trump’  she not closing her business.. just trading different  commodities
149 2018-08-12 07:49:41 How can u even measure poverty/suffering? When u can't afford to acquire some basic needs or can't get value 4 ur money. The commodities out there out valued your plenty pennies u hv that makes u think u ar rich. This admin plunged us into this mess with thier archaic eco policy
150 2018-08-12 07:31:30 In a way, this stems from a mathematical assumption:that utility functions for commodities behave regularly. But food doesn't work that way: if you don't have enough, you just die. And profits don't work that way: if you are large enough to make demands, you can benefit long term
151 2018-08-12 07:30:37 #CrossoverNaTuskys The commodities at @TuskysOfficial are 50% off don't miss this opportunity
152 2018-08-12 07:21:49 But can you model leisure as a commodity? Basic rules for commodities fall apart when buying too much of it *kills you*. There is no mention anywhere of the fact that by lowering the "cost" of this commodity (i.e. paying people less) you are forcing people to buy LESS of it.
153 2018-08-12 07:20:54 In truth I'm glad you're talking about this. Pork farming for export to China can fetch Nigeria $100 million if we take only 10% of the abandoned American market. 
Soybeans, Almonds and other commodities can be grown here too.

154 2018-08-12 07:18:54 Can you share your source of info, if it is from NBS, that may be true because they move from market to market to know the actual price of goods and commodities
155 2018-08-12 06:46:19 Only in Nigeria is the place people sell commodities at the dollar equivalent but same can't be done when you render service.
156 2018-08-12 06:34:13 Let's move on coz basic commodities prices are twice we can't afford this you must go to the office
157 2018-08-12 06:20:11 No, I don't think real love is a commodity at all as in a thing people buy & sell. Some things do cost effort & time & have real consequences & effects, yet are not commodities ... why do you ask?

171 2018-08-12 03:19:07 The word “global” shouldn’t scare you. International trade is what has given us our high standard of living. Think of all the commodities we export: iron ore, coal, meat, fruit, dairy, fish, wood... trade is our main growth engine.

173 2018-08-12 03:01:02 In an interview with the BBC, I commented on the global market’s demand for commodities and its implications for resource-rich nations such as Australia. Investment in LNG and other sources of energy are competing with the supply and the price of traditional natural resources.
174 2018-08-12 02:59:33 Research question. To what extent has the financialisation of basic living commodities (energy, communications, shelter) eclipsed all other sectors of the economy and been a drain on resources as a result ?

182 2018-08-12 01:30:28 According to the latest National Bureau of Economic Research, cryptocurrencies have less exposure to stocks, fiat currencies, precious metal commodities and macroeconomic factors. Cryptos significantly impacted by time-series momentum and investor attention.
183 2018-08-12 01:28:56 There is no analysis it is a fact. As I said If you scroll down all my tweets down to 2017 you will find this Bloomberg article where it was stated exactly the wording Loss and the figure 600 million and replacement of the heads of commodities division.
184 2018-08-12 01:26:57 Para q sean  cn  y  cn  hay q excluir el precio! Si bien la cuenta corriente/balanza de pagos se ve afectada x caída  precios d los commodities es muy importante ver si el volumen exportado fue igual mayor o menor y en q porcentaje! Textiles x la vía de precios d fibra
185 2018-08-12 01:23:27 Like I said, your analysis is lacking. You said "Bloomberg reported that they had a loss of 600 mln in the first 9 months of 2017 in commodities division". Your article does not say that. A reduction in revenue of 600M is not the same as a loss of 600M in earnings. BIG difference
186 2018-08-12 01:23:11 Splitting Fonterra into a sales and marketing arm, and a commodities processing arm, makes a lot of sense for farmers and shareholders. Allows boards with expertise in respective areas to be constructed. Your reporting on this is world class. Thank you.
187 2018-08-12 01:13:05 So... You feel we’re commodities more than constituants?
188 2018-08-12 01:12:51 Commodities Twitter!!!

191 2018-08-12 00:28:11 Really? There is no separate "commodities" BU at GS, it is a part of a broader BU.  BTW, the BU that includes commodities, did not lose money through Q3.  Feel free to post the article, however, I'd love to read it and see my mistake. Seriously.
192 2018-08-12 00:25:49 Our fathers paid five dollars a week child support.  My mother had no car, no job.  The four of us lived in a two room house.  No indoor bathroom. We received welfare, with the social workers always at the door. We received commodities.  When food stamps started we got them.
193 2018-08-12 00:04:12 Our ancestors were not only intrigued by Christianity, but also by the guns, horses, & drugs the Europeans brought to us

194 2018-08-11 23:55:40 I don't believe in open borders. I believe in socialist borders. Neo-liberalism is all too happy to have commodities, exploitable labor, and capital crossing borders as well as imperialism and environmental destruction driving mass migration.

198 2018-08-11 23:38:03 With the rapidly rising prices of commodities, we have to expect increased number of criminal activities. That's how poverty works.

234 2018-08-11 21:55:46 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.

240 2018-08-11 21:20:35 For what it’s worth, your smug “our farms” view on agriculture in general disgusts me. Agriculture/commodities are and should be market driven, and safe from your political drama. As you clearly demonstrate in your recent hit piece on ethanol where you side with big oil.
241 2018-08-11 21:05:32 Yes credit and equity but commodities?
242 2018-08-11 21:01:34 Commodity production is a social system wherein production is done to sell in a market (which is identical to saying it's the production of commodities, btw).

A material base is all the relations of production which produce the rest of society.

This is, like, Marx 101.
243 2018-08-11 21:00:31 Frustrated by the lack of attention on the looming distribution demise our country is facing. With the shortage of OTR truckers, commodities for everything will increase. I see lots a press about this but no investment in a solution.

246 2018-08-11 20:18:11 I'm old enough to remember when vegetarians were looked upon as freaks, as if kindness to animals were some sort of character defect, when the truth is that treating animals like commodities is a character defect.
247 2018-08-11 19:58:34 Also all of this assumes institutions want to own Bitcoin in the first place. 

This all reminiscent when Institution invested in physical commodities. 

I'm not sure institutions understand the value proposition of Bitcoin.
248 2018-08-11 19:56:26 1980 was the panic peak. Gold had made a run from 35 dollars to 800 dollars. An amazing run. A correction, pushed by central bank manipulation and gold sales was a logical counter reaction. Commodities live on these action-reaction extremes. Learn to trade them & make money.
249 2018-08-11 19:54:26 Thanks. 

1. It seems custodians (such as Bakket) are the only way Institutions to invest. 
2. Won't it make it easier now for someone, like GS, to sell total return swaps on the bitcoin provide the economic equivalent of ownership as done with other commodities.
250 2018-08-11 19:46:15 #CrudeOil Its possible that we may see an up move here. if next bar's SlowK is also up, then a possible bottom may have been established. The market looks strong both long term & short term. The SlowK is at (34.73). A good upward move is possible #OOTT #OPEC #Commodities
251 2018-08-11 19:34:55 #CrudeOil RSI is somewhat oversold (RSI is at 46.23), suggesting a possible rally. Supporting this outlook, the bullish key reversal off a 9 bar new low here suggests an upturn in the market on August 10. #OOTT #OPEC #Commodities #EnergyMarket $USO $UCO #WTI #brent $QM_F
252 2018-08-11 19:33:40 Your view on this is severely naive. Right out in the open you disregard the destructive path a crony currency creates. the trillions in debt, the degradation of living standards of citizens. Golds value is like all commodities, it is NOT correlated to a manipulated currency.
253 2018-08-11 19:26:19 The problem is men in that community see women as commodities who just want to latch on to someone and not individuals capable of enjoying something and working at it. It’s very sad.
254 2018-08-11 18:53:22 In my opinion, I would advise those of you that are long gold....to remember that the market before it makes a major move will attempt to shake out those that have weak positions...#Gold #Commodities #Futures
255 2018-08-11 18:52:40 Because for gov Indian people are commodities not human,they will sell everyone (Data)
256 2018-08-11 18:45:04 That’s correct and incorrect, SA is a net food exporter overall but is a net importer of staple food products.
With the drought this situation could change with less volumes available of export commodities like fruit and nuts to Europe.
257 2018-08-11 18:43:06 Think about it! For those of you who base your investment and trading decisions on what the Dow does...If it (the Dow) were to drop to 24988.50 or below....before or instead of testing this year's high of 26616.71....what would you encourage your clients to do? #Commodities
258 2018-08-11 18:41:29 Claro, pero para que la maquila funcione se requiere capital externo, seguridad jurídica y bajos impuestos y regulaciones... por lo que vuelvo a insistir en la empresarialidad y crear las condiciones para atraerla. No son los commodities, son las condiciones pro empresa.
259 2018-08-11 18:11:08 We are a commodities spot market.
260 2018-08-11 18:08:21 I want a Super Bowl, I don’t need commodities at this point. This could be a SB season. The chance to trade him has probably passed or they would have done it by now. Plus, Howie wants to win now! I’d trade Foles in a sec. if I got an equal replacement. The gap is btw QB2 and 3.
261 2018-08-11 18:01:49 Magari ce l’ha e io,che sono trader di commodities e non di currencies,non lo vedo.Detto questo,secondo me sarebbe un gamble più che un trade.
262 2018-08-11 17:58:14 If the market shows signs that it's going to breakout to the upside...remember... that 80% of all breakouts fail....so position yourself stop-wise to protect your money....I would not rule out the potential for a nice short to test Friday's low of (66.14)...#Commodities
263 2018-08-11 17:46:10 Light sweet Crude oil is currently at a key level of resistance (price level....67.75). What you do at this key price level will say much about your skills....Be patient and learn to listen to the market...let the market tell you want to do.
More later..#commodities #Oil #Futures

266 2018-08-11 16:34:51 Aí vc vai dizer "Aiin mas o Lula levou a gente pra 6a potência mundial."

Quando o presidente ainda era o FHC, os "Commodities" entraram na "moda", e o Brasil como é rico, Lula deu sorte então o Brasil subiu pra 8a posição.
267 2018-08-11 16:14:17 Commodities prices have gone down drastically, IMO due to bumper harvest last year and earlier this year. Availability of substitutes e.g maize, yams etc. More people have taken to farming more than before. Some people may have diverse opinions but it can only get better
268 2018-08-11 16:13:01 I purchased some in physical. Don't trade commodities.
269 2018-08-11 16:11:48 Gold has underperformed the s&p for a long time. Why you all chase currencies and commodities not companies I don't know. But make your own financial decisions am not your advisor!

272 2018-08-11 15:53:47 Imagine a fast, fee-free DEX that allowed you to trade not only alts but also commodities (e.g., gold, oil, soybeans...etc.), bonds, fiat, and every other asset class. Would you use it? Now imagine it being built on $XLM and being released this summer @SpineMonkey @spurgeon9196
273 2018-08-11 15:49:25 The Central Government has failed to control the Dearness.Dearness is increasing continiously
There are ups&downs only in the prices of commodities relating to farmer's produce,but the prices of commodities produced by industries,workshops,factories etc are increasing day-by-day
274 2018-08-11 15:37:01 A few own capital the means of production (directly or indirectly through money capital). They purchase MofP & labour power to produce commodities to sell, but only for more money than laid out in production. The profit comes from paying labour less than the value they create.
275 2018-08-11 15:31:56 Guy is foolish,like we are commodities to be taken
276 2018-08-11 15:31:30 @JohnMedaille I’m currently reading (and enjoying!) Toward A Truly Free Market, but I believe you’ve made a glaring omission of the full history and nature of money in the chapter “Fictitious Commodities: Money”.

O que o Pochmann chama de herança benigna é, na verdade maligna.

285 2018-08-11 14:06:37 Imran govt. can enforce existing consumer law effectively so that many people compmanies who are charging extra profit will bound to sell commodities on govt decided price with good quality. Such as Milk man etc in this way a large no of people will benefited.

290 2018-08-11 13:40:16 You write enough? What does that mean? Anyway, like all the other nationalists, you are not able to produce a respect economist who agrees with your view. Economists say, pretty uniformly, that an iScotland would face very tough conditions. Having commodities is not the point.
291 2018-08-11 13:38:45 It only took one member of Captain Sher Khan's family to stand up to Manzoor Pashteen & his group of thugs. Courage, dignity and pride are commodities which sadly for Pashteen & his stuntmen can't be purchased of the shelf.

305 2018-08-11 11:52:43 Real shortages never happen. It's all speculation: Once you search, you find. Remember what they said about oil in the 80s: Now we know we'll pay Big Oil to keep it in the ground. Same for ALL commodities. Also, we abandonned the stone age before shortage of stones.
306 2018-08-11 11:46:15 1.)You want people to come to the market and be lamenting about the price of commodities inside the market with a 100dB Megaphone? 2).Your visit to juat one market in your neighbourhood is sufficient to give a blanket statement about the the economy?.Purulent stuffs!!

313 2018-08-11 09:33:59 From where to get money ey to invest? Watching Sachin okay was free. 13000 families which invested Rs 11000 crores  in commodities in #NSEL, were looted in fraud, and all tax paid money lost, with no action from govt......

We should have it watched Sachin.....and not invested!

321 2018-08-11 08:48:35 As a Newsman, I know that, bad news sell more but, in terms of PMB, is that which have refuses to sell.

What could be responsible? Is it they can't package it well? You define what it is, and as to why their commodities isn't selling!
322 2018-08-11 08:43:13 Yes, but in the context of recognizing that it has to be done in such a way to keep both eyes on how to export and that it will take years to refocus away from commodities and, thus, this is not a quick fix. Commodities will be a major part of the portfolio for a long time yet.
323 2018-08-11 08:28:42 You just scoffed at tax cuts, then talk about food? The government puts in several economic programs in play to make commodities affordable for people. Success of that is seen in the fact you can now get fresh food coast to coast, was not always the case.

334 2018-08-11 07:13:36 Stock market does well when investments in manufacturing, trade and commerce and other speculative investments like RE and commodities become less lucrative. The actual judgement of a market strength is through the sectoral PE ratios. Compare them and you can predict a bubble.
335 2018-08-11 06:47:48 That's my whole point. Trying to treat them the same - commodities to be bought and sold and traded - makes no sense.

337 2018-08-11 06:30:43 Resources such as oil were totally useless to the middle east until Westerners invented technology that could make use of such resources.

339 2018-08-11 05:42:28 Mr. President, is SRC chairperson's  position a preserve of one tribe? Two why should we raise the prices of basic commodities anytime you government reads the budget and third why should those international monetary institution dictate how you tax commodities like fuel
340 2018-08-11 05:31:24 Careful of the UK and Americans. They are after business deals and care nothing about stability of your country. When unstable, the better for their business because commodities are cheaper. Ask Kenya.
341 2018-08-11 05:16:58 Other nations will learn from it. In the future, they will abolish the link between their currency and commodities with the US dollar. Don't forget the massive US debts.

345 2018-08-11 04:40:38 You're whatever the narrative dictates at any given moment. It's really that simple. To the a leftist, everything is about the will to power. Individual people are either commodities or liabilities. The former, to be exploited, the latter neutralized.
346 2018-08-11 04:39:25 Out. Please. As promised / threatened by David Cameron and all the others who mistakenly thought that overpaying for basic commodities and failing to engage in the global market was somehow attractive to voters in the EU ref.

358 2018-08-11 03:04:29 An ETF is just a bundle of something you can invest in, like commodities or group of stocks, but you can buy them in smaller chunks. If I wanted to invest in Vanguard index mutual fund, it would have to be a $3000 minimum deposit, and you can buy/sell once a day.
359 2018-08-11 03:01:37 And if #palmoil gets banned the same people would clear the same land for another crop. Palm oil is not the problem. Companies clearing forest should be exposed worldwide, no crop should replace forest. Consumers should demand (and reward) deforestation free commodities.
360 2018-08-11 02:54:09 Trying to wrap my head around ETFs.  Bundle package of various bonds, stocks, commodities, investors all chip in on at starting price that fluctuates through the day.  I assume they increase purchases with additional investment by individual members?
361 2018-08-11 02:48:55 I do agree that (Android) phones are basically commodities now. Which is fine and I'm glad that's becoming the case. That being said, the Note 9 is a damn beast. If I had to choose a phone not in the Pixel series to get right now, that would be it.
362 2018-08-11 02:47:03 China intentara estimular su economía ante la desaceleración, esto impactará el precio de los commodities y otros activos.
363 2018-08-11 02:42:08 OF COURSE IT WILL BE PROFITABLE!!! $Gold $Silver are dead commodities and prices keep falling but the retail remains the same OR HIGHER.

364 2018-08-11 02:27:04 SPFism isn't a strictly liberal viewpoint. Also, SNFism is, if anything, incredibly idealistic. It ignores the material conditions that bring about trafficking and abuse of adult performers, as well as the very real conditions that cause sexual commodities such as say (c)
365 2018-08-11 02:19:02 Well, u done it, u have raised the price of vehicles, and commodities without a second thought of what it is going to do U.S. economy, loss of jobs now in S.C., OH, MI, is just the beginning. Too many people are loosing their jobs now. How are u going to fix this?

367 2018-08-11 02:09:00 Your addiction to drugs is not nobler than any other addiction to commodities.
368 2018-08-11 02:04:22 Here is my advice to all HS midfielders..learn how to play D and learn to shoot really well. Well rounded mids that can play both ends equally well will be prized commodities in the shot clock era.
369 2018-08-11 01:39:46 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
370 2018-08-11 01:37:40 I think its because its a commodity based economy as Canada.  Real inflation comes from commodities.  Not to be confused with cost of living.
371 2018-08-11 01:30:24 Yo lo digo en funcion de los precios de los commodities que exportamos. De 2008 a 2014 (o sea gobierno de PP) maso te la llevo, antes y despues no, estaban en niveles normales. Ademas ahora se complicaron Arg y Bra
372 2018-08-11 01:27:04 When we look back at the millennial generation, I think it will be defined as the generation of excess. Growing up in times of a booming economy with surplus of commodities, the generation became more about $5 avocado toast and wine bars instead of taking up meaningful causes.
373 2018-08-11 01:18:39 If you think capitalists are bad during the "why isn't anyone able to afford my commodities?!" era, just imagine how bad they'll be if they ever decide they don't need to sell their commodities anymore.
374 2018-08-11 01:07:03 Kimmel is part of a system that trades in kids as commodities... he won’t sound off on this because he’s a coward. He cry’s for a lion and turns a blind eye to the atrocities at the border.
375 2018-08-11 01:04:14 La educación debería ser pilar en exportación de servicios y tecnología para los commodities. El orden impositivo debería tener como prioridad pymes tecnológicas y los grandes deberían poner su propio marco para el crecimiento.
376 2018-08-11 00:59:55 These clowns have been doing this behind everyone’s back. The sneaky way this was being done makes my blood boil. No vetting, no hearings, no senate approval. This is MASSIVE CORRUPTION.  THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE OUTRAGED. Veterans are our heroes, not commodities
377 2018-08-11 00:59:31 Commercials (in commodities = producers & users, in financials = dealers) put positions on to hedge price risk. Speculators trade to make a profit. Pensions, hedge funds, and retail traders are obviously different in scope but are all trying to speculate to make $
378 2018-08-11 00:56:59 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
379 2018-08-11 00:51:17 If we control OPEC we control the world. Look around at all of these U S companies buying up gold. Not because it's pretty. Gold commodities are the most stable thing in the world. First country to back their currency with gold is going to win. Watch
380 2018-08-11 00:42:07 @realDonaldTrump should NEVER have brought the "qualified-for-nothing" diva @OMAROSA  into the @WhiteHouse . Unfortunately fame and fortune seekers treat loyalty and friendship as trade-able commodities. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #TRAITOR #Omarosa #RINO
381 2018-08-11 00:40:17 Turks hold USD for store of value fyi because its easily convertible back to LIRA when they need to spend it. poor people dont have savings to buy commodities for retirement savings.
382 2018-08-11 00:37:42 Technically, there are sanctions on using USD in trade with Iran, but importing Iranian commodities should not be embargoed (with the exception of certain items)
383 2018-08-11 00:33:09 My Weyerhaeuser customer just told me they only have two more export shipments left of logs bound for China. They only have two customers, Japan and China. 

What do you think Japan is going to do once they realize how huge our surplus is on these types of commodities?
384 2018-08-11 00:23:37 commodities are things that are bought and sold and have exchange value and use values. unless you're literally being paid for your knees and wrists to be "jacked up," calling your body a commodity doesn't make any sense.

396 2018-08-10 22:36:24 I would like an Independent Scotland. I believe Scotland would be more financially stable than rUK in a short period. We have many notable commodities eg food and drink, energy,  oil, fish, expertise in many areas. Making weapons and war is a bad idea.

399 2018-08-10 21:59:37 You have no idea what rights are. You put "right" in quotes when you refer to bearing arms/self preservation, but not when referring to commodities. Declaring a right to a commodity means that other people have to pay by force to supply those commodities.

424 2018-08-10 21:31:52 Actually President Trump is going to recover all the lead from the south side of Chicago and sell it all on the commodities market.
425 2018-08-10 21:25:09 I think that human rights should not be commodities. So, healthcare, food, education, housing, things we need to survive - any government worth a shit is gonna provide those to citizens.
426 2018-08-10 21:24:21 It would fall on deaf ears but someone should tell Trump that there's more to life than one's bank balance.  I'm surprised he didn't sell his children at birth! Oh wait, he uses them to make him more money and commit crimes for him. They're clearly just commodities to him. SAD!
427 2018-08-10 21:12:05 NFL players are not commodities or widgets.  They are highly talented - and paid well.

If the owners could easily replace them, then they would.

Without the players, the NFL fails - everyone knows that.

Not the same as other workplaces.

429 2018-08-10 21:04:33 Trust is not among the cheap commodities.
430 2018-08-10 20:53:39 my point about managers still stands: their job is superfluous to realizing commodities. but clerks aren't.
431 2018-08-10 20:43:23 They aren’t commodities or on equal fields
432 2018-08-10 20:40:46 The capitalist mode of production is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation, wage-based labour and—at least as far as commodities are concerned—being market-based.
433 2018-08-10 20:37:30 Il problema è se le aspettative dei mercati siano mosse da parametri oggettivi o se grossi gruppi finanziari pongano pressione su valute, commodities e borse per innescare questi movimenti. Non dimentichiamo che quasi tutto si basa su algoritmi che reagiscono a determinate soglie
434 2018-08-10 20:37:30 At 0.2% m-o-m and 2.4% y-o-y, Core #CPI is firming, but we think it unlikely to move much higher, as some of the metric’s larger components, such as
rent-of-shelter, used cars, and medical care commodities are potentially
trending lower, weighing on future Core readings.
435 2018-08-10 20:32:48 but the guy who sells shoes does create value. his labor is necessary for the use value to be realized as a commodity- he sells the shoe. the manager is just a boss, superfluous to the actual creation of commodities. his job is just to keep people in line.
436 2018-08-10 20:27:58 Buck on the call-up of Cedric Mullins who will debut in CF tonight- the latest addition of youth in an O's commitment to rebuild:
"All these young players coming up are precious commodities to me & the organization & I'm gong to treat them as diligently as I can."
437 2018-08-10 20:27:05 Right. More people would consume their own leisure rather than commodities because the get healthcare for free. Those people are unambiguously better off, even if it reduces GDP. 

Employers lose the surplus they capture created by hiring workers. 

Distributional issues.
438 2018-08-10 20:26:44 they just manipulate commodities for their employers, they do not create value, by the same argument. i dont think you can have it both ways
439 2018-08-10 20:25:45 Why not apply your acquired trading skills in Forex & commodities? cryptotrading and moon-lambos are broken memes by now, designed to lure gullible noobs to hold bags of shit... wait. actual manure is more useful than most coins because you can use it in farming

441 2018-08-10 20:17:56 and they say the shit i was saying above.. people who manipulate commodities for capitalists are PB, managers are PB, etc. and then u get in these weird situations where a burger king manager is supposed to b less revolutionary than an engineer making 6 figures

Mas a questão aqui não é pt, é?
444 2018-08-10 19:58:13 Well .. we could start by not flooding the African market with subsidised produce they do not need. And pay a correct price for their commodities and products.

446 2018-08-10 19:47:26 The oil prices wouldn’t have affected them nearly as much had they not taken centralized control of the economy and tried to fix commodities prices. Had they left the market free, the country would have adjusted far better.

449 2018-08-10 19:40:52 Why 8 months? What about 1 year or 2 years? Nice cherry picking timeframes that fit your narrative. Bitcoin turned me rich, absolutely nothing else in commodities/equities/financial markets would have. Deal with it, Bitcoin is a fantastic SoV
450 2018-08-10 19:26:16 and to be frank, your two specific examples *are* proletarian. people who are necessary to transport and actually sell commodities do create value. unless you think truckers and cashiers are in the same class as a car lot owner?

452 2018-08-10 19:14:35 a telemarketer or an employee at footlocker are both salespeople. they do not create value, they just push around commodities for their employers. im a software engineer, i create value. apparently im a prole but they're PB

454 2018-08-10 18:57:20 I do compare to stocks but also currencies and commodities - in any case wait for my next piece where I will do a deep dive into valuation as means of exchange and store of value.
455 2018-08-10 18:56:42 LBJ opened immigration to non-white people in 1967. So yes many more people of color have been able to come here legally this past half century. The impulse to tighten our borders ironically destroyed guest worker programs that kept produce & other seasonal commodities flowing.
456 2018-08-10 18:54:49 Kenya is so lucky to be mining oil. However, compared to our closest neighbours in Uganda we are no better. Infact, petroleum commodities are cheaper in the landlocked country.

If stating US equities "have never had a bear market", with the same logic you can state that most commodities, cryptoassets, fixed income markets and housing markets have never had a bear market.

The statement is nonsensical.

Keep scratching deeper and a little to the left. Maybe you will find the right answer. However you may want to consider this. The world has commodities and currency too. Economics are a subject left better to the highly variable view.

484 2018-08-10 16:53:59 It’s just a commodity cycle. They are all headed lower. Have to destroy a lot of built up capacity through the giant 2000-2012 up cycle. Once China resets lower I suspect commodities will be a steal but not before then.
485 2018-08-10 16:43:06 What donny fails to mention is that these tariffs increase the cost of our commodities in turn punishing our people.
486 2018-08-10 16:41:33 I've noticed since yesterday that retail prices on basic commodities has shot up by anything between 14-19%. How come the index & other factors do not impact the cost of public transport? It's been stagnant for years.

489 2018-08-10 16:29:44 Yes! It's not perfect. But how else can you solve this kind of 'tragedy of the commons'? We seem to have a fantasy that the road and parking should be free and equally available to everyone at all times, unlike other scarce commodities. Unfortunately not practical!
490 2018-08-10 16:23:43 Hein? Os maiores produtores mundiais de trigo são: China, Índia, Rússia, Estados Unidos, França e Canadá. Na época de safra, o Brasil verifica quem tem o melhor preço de um deles. E continua pagando em dólar. E qual a relação de monopólio com compra de commodities?

585 2018-08-10 08:35:00 Imagine this: the US dilebrately causing havoc in Mexico & Canada and losing two huge markets for its commodities and facing security concerns around its borders as a result. Does that make any sense? Why would Iran deliberately destabilize Iraq and lose a market?
586 2018-08-10 08:20:52 #FuelPriceMustFall for the country to grow economically. The trickle down effect of an increase in oil prices will result in an increased cost of all other commodities. We are suffering too much already.
587 2018-08-10 08:19:47 Kenyans we are now in big trouble. This will push prices of all commodities upwards. Kenya Power ndo hao na inflated bills.......cant wait for 2022.
588 2018-08-10 08:07:45 This is how corruption affect us all . In order to recover the looted trillions, the government imposes tariffs on fuel which in turn has a ripple effects everything is transported it add cost even to basic food commodities.

590 2018-08-10 08:03:44 My take is that Zambia is doing very well in agriculture and commodities eg copper. But even with the problems in Zim, Zambia's GDP is not that much ahead of Zim. Of course they are not under land reform sanctions like Zim.

601 2018-08-10 07:03:54 Could the cultural value attached to cattle and land have created a glass ceiling for the youth of that area so that their aspirations revolve around acquiring as much of these two commodities as they possibly can and by any means possible?
