By the way, I like your updates. They are enlightening.
1 2018-04-15 23:59:06 Mate, from time to time you have had a go at some stocks I am invested in but I want to hear out all views on a stock, not just the circle jerking. Keep doing what you do.
2 2018-04-15 23:58:23 Im about to find a few stocks to invest in 
3 2018-04-15 23:57:48 But it sure allowed me to see the #truth in others behavior. The supporters turning toxic over bump stocks, omnibus and military strikes... it's a whole new world out there! #MAGA #TrustThePlan #RedPill #Qanon BUMP! LOL.
4 2018-04-15 23:57:13 Not to my knowledge... but there’s scanners that can find stocks breaking out etc...
5 2018-04-15 23:56:13 If Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategists are correct, the February sell-off in stocks was a glimpse of things to come.
6 2018-04-15 23:53:06 25% of the stocks are short, it is a bloody lot of volume. Holly cow if the thing goes up hard enough it might blow up like a nuke
7 2018-04-15 23:51:55 @mjekm5 most investors overestimate how much $ they’ll make in the short term and underestimate how much $ they can make in the long term holding growth stocks (100%+ in the right names) #investing #trading #TomsTruths
8 2018-04-15 23:50:26 True, but people lose their asses on stocks that never buy back shares, too.  It's blaming the buybacks for subsequent poor performance that gets me.

13 2018-04-15 23:45:54 I did not know what to expect after getting my quarterly review of my 401k. 

A lot of stocks are stagnant with a few exceptions.
14 2018-04-15 23:44:14 No, I will not tell you which pot stocks to buy.
15 2018-04-15 23:43:41 We (Germany) probably have no mission capable planes and no stocks of bombs anyway. But hey, our army ladies have new pregnancy-uniforms.
16 2018-04-15 23:43:15 I'll remake moon pies and make them as warm as I'm allowed....is 300°F okay? And also would you mind sharing some of your stocks with me?
17 2018-04-15 23:43:02 NEOGEN PACT stocks rallying
18 2018-04-15 23:40:00 I know it may be hard to understand, because you’ve probably never held a real gun before, like most SoundCloud rappers, but stocks are more for comfort then performance so when you have a good stock on there, there’s no reason to change it

40 2018-04-15 23:33:31 Yeah you can change out anything on a gun technically, but there’s no real reason to. “Ima blah blah Wall Street when the stocks exchange” the equivalent of “Ima burn in you in a car race when I put a cover on my steering wheel” lmao
41 2018-04-15 23:30:18 Parliament needs to ask- if these were chemical weapons stocks and manufacturing sites bombed, why were there no casualties from chemicals released into the neighbouring atmosphere?

45 2018-04-15 23:25:12 It’s really not that hard if you are a retail consumer you simply pay taxes on trades just like stocks - the government won’t let you plead ignorance - plus this is a high road assumption so if you are over paying it’s better than under paying...
46 2018-04-15 23:19:39 Boy does it sting seeing stocks I missed my own entry alerts on...Ouch. So far found missed entries, but BEAUTIFUL alerts on $SMHI $WRD 
47 2018-04-15 23:13:05 This rule applies to stocks too
48 2018-04-15 23:11:50 Mayb just won from being down 3 stocks to 1 against Atomsk Dr. Mario, what a world
49 2018-04-15 23:09:33 @martyt no such thing. Some stocks trade in other countries ($TSLA or $AAPL  in Germany) which opens early, but most stocks do not
50 2018-04-15 23:08:51 They is a very broad word in this case and nobody I own has more than 50% hedges, some less.

more critically the long term view will start moving off the 40 to 50 line and move to 50 to 60 line this summer...and that's going to show up in the stocks at some point. Or so I claim.

52 2018-04-15 23:03:30 I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock and there’s only one real reason why stocks go up.
53 2018-04-15 23:02:41 it’s funny the 1st time I read this I thought you said you were treating yourself by buying stocks lol
54 2018-04-15 23:01:10 If the Govt is so against chemical weapons, Why do WE hold stocks and are involved in research of New ones. ??.
55 2018-04-15 22:57:39 Ryan doing same thing as he done for CUTTING THE TAXES don’t protect Muller he won’t get FIRED yes just like CUTTING TAXES it is EXCELLENT DEAL sure FOR THE BIG COMPANIES all they did was buy back some their stocks
56 2018-04-15 22:56:27 As a trader who loves to gap stocks tomorrow morning will be painful to watch lol
57 2018-04-15 22:53:58 Or to put someone is stocks in the public square for swearing.

59 2018-04-15 22:50:48 In what world is ISIS destroyed? You clearly don’t understand the economy and how long policy decisions take to make an impact..all of the success for yr1-OBAMA’S!  Look at what DT is doing now with trade wars-stocks plummeting! I lost hundreds on my 401k in last 2 mos-ALL ON DT!
60 2018-04-15 22:49:46 Let's have some honesty: Chlorine is NOT a chemical weapon. It can be weaponised, mainly to spread fear, but is not a #WMD. It has thousands of everyday uses, e.g. antiseptic, swimming pools, paint, etc. No amount of bombing will destroy chlorine stocks in #Syria. #skypapers
61 2018-04-15 22:49:18 @WealthNoir I understand you will be in Atlanta next month for the Stocks & Stilettos investment conference. Looking forward to the conference.
62 2018-04-15 22:49:12 No he does not. They want smart gun reform & no semi's & bump stocks & such available to the public. And people who think they're responsible gun owners aren't always. They act before they think sometimes,  leave ng and guns laying around loaded in a school etc.
63 2018-04-15 22:48:26 I’m rooting for $CBIS and $MJNA! God bless the weed stocks!
64 2018-04-15 22:47:53 Head fuck at the end!!
65 2018-04-15 22:46:42 ... EVERY game at this point of the season still is important to virtually every team in the country: host a Regional/be top-8 or top-16 seed; make the NCAAs; improve conference tournament seed ... individually: save coaches jobs, improve players' draft stocks, etc.
66 2018-04-15 22:46:17 "Camus is read Camoo because it's French"

Uh, no
It's actually Latin

French probably only took it from Latin and applied its own pronounciation

In Latin, you read it as "Càmoos", it means "collar, muzzle, slave stocks"
67 2018-04-15 22:45:22 I dumped my FANG stocks a few weeks ago...
I don't need their blood money!
68 2018-04-15 22:45:09 I have my hands beyond full sifting through filings for my #otc and #biotech stocks, contacting company, and recording level 2... It's just my niche.... The only thing I trade in the broader's is ETFs and currencies, few options
69 2018-04-15 22:40:10 Lol. Look at Americans in P.R. they are dying. No help. Middle class and poor- hatdly got anything from the Tax cut. Trade war- dropping our stocks and threatening jobs. EPA- destroying emviromental protections to threaten to pollute water ways and destroy our land
70 2018-04-15 22:39:49 bullish or bearish for stocks?  Curious to know if you know.  So confirm for me...pls.  thanks.
71 2018-04-15 22:39:41 I have been saying we will trade stocks as we do Cryptocurrency within 10 years. It will make the system more robust. People will hold their private keys as they once held stock certificates. If you want to have backup protection companies can register the ownership as before
72 2018-04-15 22:38:38 en fait c'est des entrepots vides , prevenu à l'avance  ils ont eu le temps d'evacuer tout, ainsi , tout le monde est satisfait , et sauve sa face! en ne bombarde pas des stocks ou des usines ou il y'a des produits ou armes chimiques, c'est une evidence!
73 2018-04-15 22:38:21 Je ne parle même pas de certaines descentes politiques cette semaine qui fustigeaient des frappes en assimilant ça à « une guerre d’Irak bis » alors que celles-ci ciblaient des stocks d’armes chimiques, et n’ont fait aucune perte civile...
74 2018-04-15 22:37:34 People may have adjustable stocks for comfort and length but there’s no different type of stocks, they just differ on how they absorb recoil (bump is a slide absorber) so you wouldn’t “exchange” them out.
75 2018-04-15 22:34:40 D'un point de vue technique, je ne peux en effet pas dire que ce soit des stocks d'armes prêtes à l'emploi. Peut-être ont ils visés des maillons de la chaîne ce qui peut être suffisant pour enrayer la machine.
76 2018-04-15 22:33:51 Shares of stocks are entirely an invented creation of humans and law.

Code does NOT understand or recognize what a share is.

But companies can legally recognize digital assets as shares just like they can recognize pieces of paper to be shares.
77 2018-04-15 22:33:19 Pretty sure the @OrlandoMagic are biting themeselves in the butt trading away Oladipo. That’s why you’re one of the laughing stocks of the NBA.
78 2018-04-15 22:33:00 Ceux qui traitent les gens favorables à des frappes en #Syrie de «va-t-en guerre» ont-ils la bonne fois d’adresser la même qualification aux autres pays comme la Russie et l’Iran, qui SYSTÉMATIQUEMENT, conduisent des raids meurtriers non pas contre des stocks, mais des civils ?
79 2018-04-15 22:32:56 That certainly is the mainstream view, giving them prior warning means if they did have stocks left, they could have protected them. It's not a left/right phenomena either, a trust problem has developed, yes Russia exploit it for propaganda, but the root cause is home grown.
80 2018-04-15 22:31:00 Nope the Dea and corrupt government caused this epidemic. Pressuring doctors to not treat pain with needed painkillers. The poor souls who’s in pain either kills themselves or go to street drugs. We’re there lives are destroyed and corrupt politicians private prison stocks go up
81 2018-04-15 22:29:31 Couldn't be happier with the open... I mean stocks at first reaction are up firmly. Nasdaq $NQ_F +49.50 +.75%, Dow $YM_F +174 +.72%, S&P $ES_F +18.25 +.69%! Rolling up (puts) & staying long outright, but if we weaken at least hedged & in things like Gold, Vix, Treasuries, SFranc.

85 2018-04-15 22:27:03 #TheresaMay must answer:
1. Why did UK attack Syria, no threat to the UK, because of an online video of unknown provenance?
2. Did she absolutely know the purpose of the buildings struck by the UK?
3. Does she believe it safe to attack gas/bio warfare stocks with explosives?
86 2018-04-15 22:26:33 I have noticed a decent correlation with Crypto and the stock market, when the stock market goes great money flows from crypto when #crypto goes great money flows from #stocks, mainly the spec end.. #ASX Chop
87 2018-04-15 22:26:29 Tried to have a go at some BBC games earlier but found it's still switching to b+w only after about 10 minutes. D'you know if anyone stocks replacement modulators or am I going to have to hunt for parts?
88 2018-04-15 22:24:06 So far, on news of #Syria the purchasing power of your S&P stocks is going up and purchasing power of your gold going down!
89 2018-04-15 22:24:00 TaxScam Bill
5. Turns out 85% of Corporate Tx cuts went to Stock buybacks, Exec Bonuses, dividends
6. Since 80% of stocks are owned by only 20% of Americans dividends/stock Mrkt gains don't help 80%
7. Just 13% of Tax Cuts went to: new JOBS, higher salaries&Bonuses. NOT MUCH
90 2018-04-15 22:22:32 @Ryan_McQueeney  Motely Fool talks about a tech stock for the future i think for ai is there ai stocks worth watching?
91 2018-04-15 22:22:25 Most of my stocks have PE's under 10 and have been punished lol
92 2018-04-15 22:21:44 So the question is, would speeding up the transfer of stocks (between brokers) unlock more value for anyone, or be valuable, or create value? 

I am biased-- I know that I want programmatic control of my assets. Need to show the benefit for non-programmers.
93 2018-04-15 22:21:16 While stocks have historically sold off immediately after a military strike or terrorist attack, they generally bounce back relatively quickly.
94 2018-04-15 22:20:25 Other then that..thats my view for the week on my favorite stocks in the OTC...If I don't post for one day, it doesn't mean I sold , it is called I have a LIFE. A family, a wife, 3 kids, and lot to worry about other then everyones uncontrollable emotions. I walk the walk

97 2018-04-15 22:18:42 Advertisers left for #LauraIngraham. ”Lady Bump Stock: “The lightweight bump stocks for delicate hands.”Reverse mortgage: “We’ll take that house now.”.... “Caught in a scandal and need an escape? Malaysian Airlines.”Cream soda: “The soda for whites. You got the white one, baby.”
98 2018-04-15 22:17:42 Also though, I'm going to totally guess that most taxpayers have neither itemized deductions nor stocks either.
99 2018-04-15 22:16:23 Most people probably fall into just filing Scheduled A (itemizing), Scheduled B (Interest) and Scheduled D (Stocks); which; unless you have a ton of sales (usually b/c of a bad investor); yea a ReadyReturn would be desirable.
100 2018-04-15 22:15:31 Horrible to watch any violence.But if there must be any violence at all in this world-let it be against a grown man of power in the community who molested a young defenseless girl (or boy) child. But even then-isn’t there a better-non-violent way?Put him in stocks=public shaming?
101 2018-04-15 22:14:00 U.S. stocks fell in Friday trading amid weakness in bank and financial stocks.

103 2018-04-15 22:13:15 Thanks Dale. Yes, I remind people of that each time our interview is mentioned or ask me about my view on stocks and / or monetary policy going forward. Certainly seems to be going to plan so far.

114 2018-04-15 22:03:41 On a des preuves que la France utilise des grenades et des gazs contre sa population (voir Nantes/NDDL).
Un pays veut-il bien bombarder les stocks possédés par notre état, ainsi que le fabricant ?
Merci, pas besoin de passer par l'ONU on a les preuves
115 2018-04-15 22:00:24 How is BC breaking law? Alberta and Ottawa don't own BC. The constituents don't want a bigger pipeline in their backyard & we dont want Alberta dirty oil decimating our coastline or #salmon stocks. So get over it. Why not head North, not much going on up there, just saying. 
116 2018-04-15 22:00:09 Either Alberta +/- Sask  and perhaps BC ... or a national partnership ... breaking the oil company's strangle hold on refining capacity is essential .. and the very least reducing to base stocks makes transmission by pipeline a tolerable risk

119 2018-04-15 21:55:54 Frank Benzimra, head of global markets for Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking, said stocks would plunge only in case of new strikes by Western powers.
120 2018-04-15 21:55:36 Il n’y a que des gros cons pour trouver ça normal de bombarder des stocks d’armes chimiques. Vous bombarderiez une réserve de bombe nucléaire ? Non bah là c’est pareil pour les populations autour. #Syrie

122 2018-04-15 21:54:52 Tokyo will be the first major market to open on Monday and the yen will likely strengthen to the dollar, but not beyond 106.50, said Itsuo Toshima, market analyst at Toshima & Associates adding that he didn’t expect stocks traders to make sharp moves.
123 2018-04-15 21:53:10 What was accomplished was that we dropped half a billion dollars of Tomahawk missiles and helped defense industry stocks. That’s what was accomplished.

127 2018-04-15 21:48:45 but yeah, coming from a multi-asset background where realistically equities is the major lever for driving returns, you almost have to have an optimistic hue to your work as history is on the side of optimists when it comes to stocks in the long run...
128 2018-04-15 21:48:41 In between there was a pretty successful career trading stocks.
129 2018-04-15 21:46:56 can you give us the gist of the misunderstanding in 280 characters? With stocks having soared past ATHs within a decade of the crisis it's reasonable to ask exactly what stage of the Minsky Debt Deflation process we're currently in.
130 2018-04-15 21:46:33 @LoveWilko  Hi looking for a store nearest to Edinburgh that stocks the 50p pint glasses. Looking for 100
Many thanks
131 2018-04-15 21:45:54 Can you explain what difference the HQ of a company makes in investment decisions? Do you own stocks, RRSPs, or mutual funds? Do you buy imported products?
132 2018-04-15 21:45:45 Ya hi there Maria.  I think you should stick with stocks.
133 2018-04-15 21:44:58 Ha
134 2018-04-15 21:44:25 And then......
135 2018-04-15 21:43:36 Those with enough capital to invest in financial instruments (stocks/bonds/etc) reap the 'benefit' of the inflation while the working class & poor see wage stagnation with decreased purchasing power

In the end, cost of staples will double/triple over the course of your lifetime
136 2018-04-15 21:43:34 follow the money. look at all the insurance company stocks. then ask yourself  who profited from Obamacare.
137 2018-04-15 21:43:33 Je suis partagé sur l'ambition globale du truc. Mettons nous a la place d'un Nike France qui doit être bien content de refourguer des factures à 100/200 000€ mensuelle à un shop
Ce que le shop fait des stocks c'est juste pour la com
138 2018-04-15 21:43:17 Is this process any different to doing taxes after buying/selling stocks?
139 2018-04-15 21:38:49 You can say whatever you want, we all know he would have been nothing without his dad's money.
If he did put his money into stocks he would have far more than he actually does. Also given his past records he only got by being a piece of work and abusing the system, gj 0 moral.

144 2018-04-15 21:29:16 So stocks open green in an hour? And if they don’t BTFD as it’s only going up. Bombs dropped, now move along nothing to see here.
145 2018-04-15 21:27:02 If y'all ain't buying and selling stocks yet better Google it and learn start that hustle baby don't settle for broke

147 2018-04-15 21:25:50 Good to hear, but steel stocks were a good purchase with this President. He ran on bringing back manufacturing and stated that he was looking to stop the dumping of cheap steel in this country.

150 2018-04-15 21:23:40 Are the 203 and 205 still being made, or is it a case of “while stocks last”?
151 2018-04-15 21:20:11 9 breakouts: $BJRI, $CKH, $VNOM. Two sub-$1. One $1-2. Penny stocks creeping back in.
152 2018-04-15 21:20:00 yeah we LUV volatile stocks #Guilty
153 2018-04-15 21:18:12 Syria had stocks of the chemical weapons being used & has all the means to deploy it, incl by planes & helicopters. OPCW has confirmed previous CW use. Yet you prefer to believe two authoritarian leaders who bomb civilians areas, but have unsurprisedly denied any responsibility.
154 2018-04-15 21:17:19 I guess stocks will soar...
155 2018-04-15 21:16:29 Tax relief??!!

My paycheck hasn’t changed!!

However, corporations are buying back stocks at a record pace. 

So, mission accomplished. You gave tax relief to your corporate donors, the wealthy, and fu$&ed the rest of us.
156 2018-04-15 21:15:19 If there are stocks of nerve agents they are probably in the base in the North not at that university. The rumours I read a while ago said they had built deep underground tunnels that we couldn't hit with missiles anyway.
157 2018-04-15 21:15:09 #Trump supporting #marijuana and #Canada #legalization coming soon. #Weed #Stocks on the rise
158 2018-04-15 21:15:01 UN security council allowed chemical weapon stocks to remain. Our government acted. Seems more like common sense to me. 
159 2018-04-15 21:11:33 How will the S&P 500 Futures open on Sunday after an eventful couple of days on the geopolitical side? $SPY #markets #stocks
160 2018-04-15 21:10:00 FTSE Futures have rallied for 3 weeks in a row, adding 406 points (+6.0%), making it the biggest 3 week gain seen in the 91 weeks since 15 July 2016. The sequence of weekly rallies last extended to 4 weeks on 29 December 2017, 16 weeks ago, when the run lasted for 6 weeks #stocks
161 2018-04-15 21:06:34 Ban large magazines, bump stocks. Fed. Background checks. Change the age from 18 to 21. 

You're clearly not 18, and I don't think you have any intention of killing anyone. Therefore you would pass a background check, and can guy your guns for sport and safety no problem.
162 2018-04-15 21:06:12 I’m quite new to stocks and cryptography. Since you were on the brains who created bitcoin and have a superior knowledge of cryptography would you have any suggestions of books to read, article videos etc that I can view and understand more.
@ProfFaustus
163 2018-04-15 21:04:26 Lol my daughter isn't born yet .  I post all stocks I own. Maybe look at the charts .  It's primed and ready . All it takes is on NR. If we get a NR of any the above . Then yes a good run will occur . Of course depending on what the specific is of the news release.
164 2018-04-15 21:04:09 If you put it in a savings account that accrues interest, that's still investing. Doesn't necessarily have to be in stocks.
165 2018-04-15 21:00:41 Yup. Mr Larsen has a ton of Ripple stocks. I bet he's buying a lambo. :D
166 2018-04-15 21:00:07 Second thing is that people hate Trump because he banned bump stocks, but they don't even own bump stocks... so why are they mad?
167 2018-04-15 20:59:59 Except with stocks....  Oh, it's negative publicity that's working positively for Comey...exactly!
168 2018-04-15 20:56:54 Can we deposit and withdraw bitcoins yet? Kinda hope you guys do this so I can just make Robinhood my onestop shop for stocks and crypto. Still waiting though.
169 2018-04-15 20:55:12 In a couple years you’ll finally be out of college and move on to your next “passion”. I’ve seen you go through stocks ETH and Sanders.
170 2018-04-15 20:54:31 Choose a portfolio of 20 gold/resource stocks. Now!  50% of capital in 5 big stocks, 25% of capital in 5 ‘mid caps’ and 25% in small and micro caps.  Then just sit and growth richer! Don’t trade.  Forget CFDs and ETFs.  Risky assets in a high risk sector.
171 2018-04-15 20:54:05 Sad part of your story is,U have no concern about bloodshed&brutality going on in Syria neither stocks of chemical weapons,your actual sadness belongs to your DNA level hate for President Trump that makes U  mentally blind to evaluate the things on merit like a crook story teller
172 2018-04-15 20:53:40 @Starbucks You cannot allow one white woman to destroy my beloved coffee. Now I’m going to lose money on the stocks. Fire that lady!!!
173 2018-04-15 20:53:01 Anyone with a Starbucks card, @StarbucksCanada (for myself) and who wishes to boycott @Starbucks in support of the outrageous staff at the named Starbucks, should go in and ask for a refund of the amount and then never return. Wonder how stocks will be Monday for the company?
174 2018-04-15 20:52:47 Then you need to ask what military matters should be put before Parliament for consideration, who defines what serious action is and whether or not it is time-sensitive, to bomb Syria in three weeks time could allow for them to hide their chemical weapon stocks etc etc.
175 2018-04-15 20:52:14 I don’t think you got what I said. It’s not about an appointment to suit me. I got a message saying stocks of my blood group were low so please donate as soon as possible. When I try to do just that I’m told July is the soonest appointment.
176 2018-04-15 20:50:49 Adventures in netplay:

Guy gets pissed I wobbled him when he counterpicked an 8-2 MU. Ragequits out while ahead in stocks.
177 2018-04-15 20:49:16 NOT NY STOCKS
178 2018-04-15 20:49:14 The wash rule specifically applies to stocks & securities. As of now, BTC & most coins traded on exchanges are not regarded as these. Meaning you can sell at a loss & buy back WITHIN the 30 days. Remember though, that you are forgoing any chance of becoming longterm cap gains.
179 2018-04-15 20:47:55 @AffinityLondon @AffinityEngland @FXS_Stocks_ZH - Hello :) Happy to meet you, have a great day :)
180 2018-04-15 20:43:54 @starbucks You Too ? Keep an eye on your stocks...oops! Was that a dip?
181 2018-04-15 20:43:41 Ban bump stocks in every state
182 2018-04-15 20:42:44 Hanep yan 1hr ako kumukuha ng stocks sa warehouse tapos di ko pa naayos!!!
183 2018-04-15 20:42:42 We have to keep all the deplorables together. I have a democratic/ independent  wife who just cant believe in  Trump. No matter what he does or says. The only thing she thanks him for is the tax break and the stocks. But she'll never vote for him but will vote 18 for right person

186 2018-04-15 20:37:52 Sold some LTC today, rebalancing into stocks.
187 2018-04-15 20:37:45 and just the worst enemy of peace, racquets fall over a demolished land.

only cowardly people do that. People who have no respect and just want to see the value of their stocks climb high
188 2018-04-15 20:37:43 @JHoyNBA if you had to pick a single stat as the best end-all be-all defensive metric in your database, would it be harmonic stocks?
189 2018-04-15 20:36:07 $SPY I'm bullish on stocks but you can't chase, only to get stopped out. I'm focused on lower (safer) entry points and/or smaller positions.
190 2018-04-15 20:34:52 Bckgrnd chcks and the banning of bump stocks are things that should be implemented. These measures are no where close to “gun control.” I have no problem passing a background check and would much rather legal, law abiding citizens be the ones owning the guns and not criminals.
191 2018-04-15 20:34:08 Not even close to what I said. Trump having financial ties to Raytheon in the way of stocks is his right as a private citizen. As soon as he was elected he should have divested all his assets, especially the ones that would cause conflicts of interest.
192 2018-04-15 20:33:54 Je pense qu'il a la légitimité internationale pour lui, le respect de toutes les règles c'est plus discutable effectivement.
Si effectivement il y avais des stocks chimiques, oui, il fallait agir...
Mais là on entre sur un débat moral
193 2018-04-15 20:26:12 You haven't read the thread. Councils have lost over half their funding. 500 libraries have gone, a quarter of librarians, book stocks slashed, opening hours cut in so-called austerity. Few other countries have seen such savage budget cuts. That was the debate, not anecdotes.
194 2018-04-15 20:26:00 I rarely play, I profit off of the game, which I've made thousand off with coin stocks and flipping accounts.  Also big reps on multiple pl-
195 2018-04-15 20:25:58 When investors talk about a stock market crash, remember one thing from business classes, if U ever took some, when stocks are sold, someone else has to be buying? Think about it, folks!
196 2018-04-15 20:24:38 Dude people stay recording or taking pictures of my Jeep and it’s on stocks right now 
197 2018-04-15 20:24:12 These beautiful pretty Original pink dungaree sets are now live over on our website.
Baby sizes up to 2 years available...while stocks last.
198 2018-04-15 20:19:59 Leveraged wealth. His name being taken down from one building after another. His money laundering about to come out in the open. 

I can't wait to follow up with you once Mueller's hammer comes down. 

If 45* had invested the money his dad gave him in stocks, he'd be richer.
199 2018-04-15 20:19:34 Yep. Small correction. Special forces went in mid-2013. CIA in 2012.
200 2018-04-15 20:19:19 $LFIN I'm also guessing that Hudson Bay, which has billions and billions of AUM and owns stocks like Disney and Visa, doesn't really want anything to do with a company that is under SEC investigation and has basically been a laughing stock. Maybe I'm wrong
201 2018-04-15 20:18:38 You're advising people about Ripple stocks on the second market but can't talk about it?
202 2018-04-15 20:18:22 Sorry to hear that, Draft. The stock price got ahead of itself when Aviva cleared and expectations built up, which caused a big sell off on news. These small and micro cap stocks are volatile and move quick both ways.
203 2018-04-15 20:15:29 Y’all are going to hammering stocks left and right. Personally I can’t wait until Graham hits a home run. It’s awesome to be apart of a trading family that take this seriously!
204 2018-04-15 20:14:59 Think how much money these companies made off just their stocks the last 5 years and we lower their taxes

207 2018-04-15 20:11:46 What are some good stocks
208 2018-04-15 20:10:05 oh okay ... yea i can see how you say he's a stock promoter lol. i mean tht comes with having a large following anyway . lol. . especially with OTC stocks
209 2018-04-15 20:09:04 Neumeyer laughs off manipulation but essentially has failed his stockholders who hold his crappy stocks. PMs are always ready to run higher with these folks. As long as they continue to get paid they will do nothing to stop investors from getting screwed
210 2018-04-15 20:08:33 Surgical strike to show all nations dictators their us no hiding place when using chemical weapons on own people or others. Russia has been sent a signal & their defence system was jammed which upset them. Will be selling more Russian ccy' sand stocks linked to them tomorrow
211 2018-04-15 20:07:28 Yes surely,  but most of us don’t have stocks.

214 2018-04-15 20:05:50 Hey man, try to keep the faith.. I think bishop just gave up on responding to us directly since it's almost like we are pressuring him to releaase something every day. Lets just let him do his thing, and trade other stocks in the meantime. No point in selling down here.
215 2018-04-15 20:04:26 IS re-purposed old stocks from Iraq - like I said.
Nobody serious says the rebels have access to chemical weapons. (I dont mean bottles of bleach or hair dye)
216 2018-04-15 20:04:19 Wonder what u think about $PG and $V?
217 2018-04-15 20:02:49 So does Putin. The Real Clear Politics average of polls puts Trump's approval rating at 42.5 percent. Who knows? A little war and TPP and stocks go up. 50% of US have pensions. If they go up, so will the polls. Stock has gone up 500% in the last decade. $50K is now $250K

222 2018-04-15 19:59:21 @SkyNews so attacks on chemical weapon production stocks and nobody suffered from gases strange
223 2018-04-15 19:58:45 Oh yes. How confident are we that IRS will apply wash sale rules to BTC? Does the rule apply to commodities? I think it applies to stocks for sure. 

What if someone had unrealized capital gains, but wanted to sell and buy back in at a lower price within 30 days. Wash sale?
224 2018-04-15 19:56:59 That intentional foul
225 2018-04-15 19:56:23 So bear hug the guy before the ball is inbounded?

231 2018-04-15 19:47:42 What are you doing?? You could have sold that fact in a booklet: "Secrets of penny stocks" haha
232 2018-04-15 19:47:09 lol.  If you gamble, you might lose.  stocks are simply legalized gambling, no sympathy for gamblers, sorry pal.
233 2018-04-15 19:45:43 Well said.  I see most people referring to their studies in respect to Penny stocks . Here’s a fact. Penny stocks are all scams. Lesson complete.  I’m in a mood today.  Learning to trade from DVDs is a joke also. It’s a process that only a real mentor can help anyone with
234 2018-04-15 19:45:28 I've seen what true passion looks like. Fund managers screaming as stocks dip further. Millions melting away.

No textbook or movie can even come close to it.
235 2018-04-15 19:43:19 Historically stocks go DOWN with interest rate hikes, THEN UP.  You're not in the THEN UP part yet....
236 2018-04-15 19:41:57 Wow wow wow! Have you seen what’s back in stock?! 

Hands up who wanted the Wipe Clean Starting School pack?!  I know there’s a few of you!!

Also, how fab is the new Science Boxset ? 

Both available to order whilst stocks last!
237 2018-04-15 19:41:03 @waitrose - great news to hear... especially because your coffee is really good . I’ve been trying to buy £3 a reusable cup in your Keynsham branch since the news came out, but as I half expected- no stocks? Can Waitrose foresee additional demand and stock up?
238 2018-04-15 19:40:52 Whenever you get a new controller you need to first, check dash back, and second, plug it into your Ouija board and reason with the spirits within. Y'all think you can lose all those stocks with it and not have any get left behind? Smh

It's nice to have a bit of company. #goodnight

244 2018-04-15 19:38:11 right now its all hand-typed so I'm limited to about 30 stocks, any beyond that is too hard to track.  I have found a direct data feed to put #'s direct into Excel but its 3K year, will prob buy it in June
245 2018-04-15 19:34:58 my guess is "tuesday"  will be a hugely disappointing day ,  perhaps theyve partnered up with the IRS,  i miss the golden days of crypto when the community was vibrant and fresh!!!!!! i feel like im back in the scam penny stocks with the jordan belforts,  go F**k yourself

249 2018-04-15 19:32:46 Yeah, just repeal that tax plan for the rich bud! The non 1% American's would be better off! Can't you see the corporations are not spending the money on their workers?  They are buying back their stocks and giving the CEO BILLIIONS!  While the workers get crumbs!
250 2018-04-15 19:30:03 ...& @POTUS’s incompetence has multiplied the death-rate EXPONENTIALLY!
Poor baby.
NOW he’s making-believe he’s all ready-eyed over the fate of those poor Libyan victims, when all he cares about is the profits he & his rich cronies will make on their defense-industry stocks!
251 2018-04-15 19:26:08 Throw $50-$100 into some cheap stocks. Once they go up a little and you make some money sell them and then invest in something different. Slowly build up, for me I started with like $100 and slowly been building up. I haven’t invested any more money out of pocked.

         Life is great!!!

267 2018-04-15 19:07:19 Yea man! Screening stocks on your own can be a daunting task. It took me years to learn to look at charts on the fly. I would definitely check out #TrueTradingGroup if your new, they can definitely speed up that learning curve. Link is in my bio on twitter. You can always dm me!
268 2018-04-15 19:07:18 like i’m sorry, are any of us waking up every day to publish books/dole out nuggets/sling beers/sell stocks and thinking “yes 100% would rather be doing this than pursuing my life’s creative passion!” 
269 2018-04-15 19:06:40 The biggest ecological disaster in recent years has been the decimation of specimen fish stocks by otters.Fen drains are now barren of specimen pike, the river Nene is barren of specimen barbel. And the MLC have gormlessly been building otter holts!

273 2018-04-15 19:01:00 Question assez basique qui me passe par l'esprit et qui vole bien plus bas que toutes les considérations géopolitiques :

BOMBARDER DES STOCKS D'ARMES CHIMIQUES POUR LES "DÉTRUIRE" NE REVIENT-IL PAS À LES DISPERSER IMPUNÉMENT SUR LES POPULATIONS VOISINES ?
274 2018-04-15 19:00:50 Cedt surtout des centres de recherches qui ont été bombardée pas les stocks ...
275 2018-04-15 18:59:45 That’s an insult to anyone who stocks  shelves anywhere

277 2018-04-15 18:58:27 What happens when stocks drop 60% as John Hussman predicts, bonds go to negative interest rates? Who pays it all then?
278 2018-04-15 18:56:38 You only have a 36% win rate. Stop trading before you go broke! Stick with dividend paying stocks.

283 2018-04-15 18:51:21 I don't know how many times this needs to be repeated to you, but those vets in that "NowThis" (lol) video do NOT represent ALL vets nor do they represent the majority. Also, bump stocks have been banned and we've agreed that they should be so why are you beating a dead horse?

287 2018-04-15 18:48:01 comment peut on bombarder des stocks d'armes chimiques sans provoquer des nuages toxiques ???
288 2018-04-15 18:46:46 Formidable, Macron informe la France possède une grande armée. Les bombardements auraient donc détruit des stocks d'armes chimiques sans provoquer de conséquences de pollution chimique. On peut expliquer ce miracle?
289 2018-04-15 18:46:21 "Seeds can be used to add flavour to stocks, stews, soups and to flavour rice. They contains an essential oil, cuminal, which is reminiscent of cumin and myrrh. Medicinal Uses: Although rarely used in herbal medicine now, the plant was used to benefit digestion"
290 2018-04-15 18:44:40 Les Reed in midfield???  Should be in the stocks with the rest of the vegetables.
291 2018-04-15 18:42:26 A wonderful find. Although, the sizes were for the snow overalls. The alpenstocks were all the same length. At first they were made of bamboo, but when war broke out it bamboo became difficult to obtain and the stocks were then made from hazelnut (like yours).

296 2018-04-15 18:37:55 This is a myth. A bias propaganda brought 2 U by tell-lie-vision. Bump stocks are hard to use and inaccurate. No one uses that crap. 2nd, it is impossible to turn a semi to an automatic. Lies fed by your politicians and the media. I wish I can turn my AR to M16 or an M4.
297 2018-04-15 18:34:37 Then the entire global banking complex lowers rates, triggers China ghost cities, inflationary faux asset growth, borrowed money recycled into stocks, low rates trigger stock buybacks gaming p.e. ratio's....

307 2018-04-15 18:24:16 I honestly want to believe you but I just know that Diane would be better off with a career change. It can't be nice to be so despised by your own supporters. "The Emperor's New Clothes" comes to my mind whenever her name comes up. It's cruel of Jezza to keep her in her stocks.
308 2018-04-15 18:23:57 I need someone to teach me about stocks.
309 2018-04-15 18:20:53 Incredible how “doing nothing” cost the US $12 billion between 2014-2017. I think we should all buy stocks in “standing idly by”. We’d make a killing.
310 2018-04-15 18:18:15 Having over a decade’s experience trading stocks has benefitted me more than words can explain. I may have been late to the crypto game (entered late 2017) but I am extremely excited to gain more experience.

313 2018-04-15 18:15:50 Wow! So you're ok with no jobs/high taxes! I know many people who are appreciative and don't complain. They don't feel entitled. Yes, Verizon gave a bonus to ALL its employees via $$ or stocks. Not seeing the problem. It's their business, they didn't have to give anything.

316 2018-04-15 18:06:37 #Stocks across most Arab markets advanced on Sunday as the risk of a military showdown between the U.S. and Russia in Syria that would roil the region faded.
Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul index led the advance and Dubai’s main equity gauge climbed the most since June. No worry guys
317 2018-04-15 18:06:32 This is where the anti-gun crowd loses a lot of ground to stand on. You're to busy blaming the object rather than the person who used it. Using your analogy, if a pilot intentionally crashed a plane you would still blame the plane and not the pilot. I do agree about bump stocks.
318 2018-04-15 18:06:13 You smoking all the pot stocks man, read what i said you still don't understand what i wrote
319 2018-04-15 18:05:19 Shoulda bought stocks in Kinder Morgan on Friday!
320 2018-04-15 18:03:58 Parce que demander des preuves avant de lancer une attaque c'est être un nazi ? 
Les barbus ont mis la main sur des stocks d'armes,  y compris chimiques,  alors produire la preuve est essentielle. 
Combien de démocrates ont menti à leurs peuples ?
321 2018-04-15 18:03:35 One of the many strining things i am learning from David Graeber's Debt: how common is historically for a government to demand taxes in one currency while the general pop uses another (usually "virtual"). There are implications for bitcoin, stocks, etc.
322 2018-04-15 18:01:07 D’accord avec les frappes sur la Syrie, le rôle de la France est d’intervenir militairement par tous moyens et détruire les stocks d’armes chimiques conformément à leurs engagements.
323 2018-04-15 18:00:59 This could literally ripple or even cascade around the world with every FIAT currency suffering the same fate.

This gives BANKERS yet another opportunity to buy stocks & shares for pennies on the dollar as happened in UK after defeat of Napoleon when Rothschild made out UK lost!

328 2018-04-15 17:57:04 Boycott this establishment. This will make the lame cry's of it's CEO  meaningful. Remember, " it's not what one says, but what one does ". Anyway,  their dirtbag products are overrated/over priced and inferior. You can spend less, get more value elsewhere. Let the stocks TUMBLE.

336 2018-04-15 17:44:14 Nicola Sturgeon criticises the air strikes against Syria on the ground that they will not further the peace process. But they were never meant to do that—and she knows it. Their aim was to destroy stocks of poison gas and to punish Assad for gassing innocent civilians. Pitiful.

338 2018-04-15 17:40:38 Yeah, my point wasn't comparing stocks/companies; instead, I was simply suggesting $ADAP stock should see the volume and share appreciation similar to what $SGMO has experienced. Best of luck with SGMO...many really like the company/stock.

341 2018-04-15 17:39:14 They said Trump would lose. He won

They said stocks would tank if he won. They rocketed up

They said he’d create a nuclear war with North Korea. North Korea agreed to negotiate denuclearization

They said he’d start a trade war. China is renegotiating

The winning never ends!!!

365 2018-04-15 17:19:57 Russia aided in verifying removal of then-existing chemical weapon stocks. The removal did not include dismantling of weapons plants. Syria has continued to manufacture chemical weapons since the removal. You're comparing apples to oranges.

367 2018-04-15 17:19:33 I like folding stocks in a close range weapon like the AK.
368 2018-04-15 17:19:25 Positive drift I think you mean and yes, you're right about that. Problem with moving averages for stocks is that it's sooo tempting to curve-fit them to what you want to see.
369 2018-04-15 17:19:01 Spending time with you has become a true investment. Your stocks always rise. Our bond will never be broken. I will never need another option because with just you I will never go broke. #committingtothecommander

385 2018-04-15 17:07:50 I don't follow. Can you say this in  another way? Is this good for stocks? Good for economy?

390 2018-04-15 17:05:32 La @Fnac n'a que de petits stocks, car @BTS_twt n'ayant pas de label en France, la Fnac ne peut importer que des quantités limitées!
Je pense plutôt que tous les exemplaires ont été vendus, mais le stock va probablement être bientôt renouvelés

391 2018-04-15 17:05:05 How to trade the stocks in chop. #SPY etc. Play for what they give you NOT what you think supposed to happen in the future. If price chopping $2 for the day. That is all you are playing out resistance/long support. Trade THE Moment, Got chop - Play chop and no MORE!
392 2018-04-15 17:04:54 Sums up the season  worst I’ve seen them in a long long time. No ideas
393 2018-04-15 17:04:53 With James Comey on his book tour all week and his face and voice saturating Cable TV news coverage Stocks will be in for a bumpy ride! Trump will undoubtedly Do or Tweet to distract. That plus Big earnings week = high IV + downward stock pressure . #stocks #Options #SyriaStrikes
394 2018-04-15 17:04:47 Actually the highest tax bracket dropped 2%. The the real windfall for the rich is buybacks and dividends in the market. The rich own the vast majority of stocks. That's where the corporate tax cuts are going.

396 2018-04-15 17:03:48 Why can't you bring back factories and companies WITH SUSTAINABLE RESOURCES in mind? Hemp, solar, Wind power, NO MORE OIL IS NEEDED. Or are the pay offs + benefits in stocks more than America becoming a sustainable power again? #prioritygreed
397 2018-04-15 17:03:45 How do you lose to West Brom? Think we’d give em a game 
398 2018-04-15 17:03:40 Really?? I can’t stop laughing  
The team is a bunch of clowns and their manager is the biggest joker. And yeah, their supporters have become laughing stocks 
399 2018-04-15 17:03:09 Yes fine.. I accepted this outcome in September! I’ve had 7 months to prepare for today!
400 2018-04-15 17:02:12 You need shot of that tosser of a manager
401 2018-04-15 17:01:16 If @theresa_may says attack on #Syria was to STOP them using chemical weapons - SURELY our #missles would blow up their chemical stocks and cause a major health problem ? @jeremycorbyn
402 2018-04-15 17:01:14 Embarrassing
403 2018-04-15 17:00:47 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
404 2018-04-15 17:00:41 Nobody ever mentions Tesla! Our world would not be what it is without him. Greatest scientist ever.

408 2018-04-15 16:58:27 Not always. If that were the case I wouldn’t have made obscene profits in shit stocks  MCTC / DUTV / LDSR this year while my real investments just prod along.
409 2018-04-15 16:56:28 What helps me think a little more clearly is a good trip to the shooting range with my kids. Shooting a thousand or more rounds with our AR-15’s, fully equipped with bump-stocks of course, then straight to the ice cream shop to make fun of the local liberals
410 2018-04-15 16:54:55 Putin knew he was-to blame for allowing Assad to retain Chemical stocks and he still has more in possibly 50 locations which need weeding out and destroying because he’s foolish and callous enough to use them again and Russia will be blamed again
411 2018-04-15 16:54:15 clearly, but,
1. How much do Feds care about equity losses in the FAANG/momo leadership stocks?
2. If they take 3 years plus to migrate towards a savings rate "tipping point" they could mitigate the shock damage. 

Is there a less austere pension solution?

413 2018-04-15 16:53:46 Maybe now CEO of @Starbucks can directly thank the carefully planned racist work of @PhillyPolice for their stocks dropping . Racism alway pretends to disappear when the money goes. Better to understand the true ugliness within the dept. #Guilty
414 2018-04-15 16:51:25 Obama had the state department bail out the bank that her husband owned stocks in.She won't ever go against Obama
415 2018-04-15 16:47:23 Barring a short and casual stint with $AMZN at 980s, never had a serious look or entry into any of the FANG stocks but finally $FB made that happen.
416 2018-04-15 16:47:15 I’m not rich, so $20 extra every two weeks is no help. If I was a millionaire I would like it. Tax cut was supposed to be for middle class. Another Trump lie.
Stocks tumbled and unemployment rate still at 4.1%.
Plus market started going up with Obama, Trump just takes the credit.
417 2018-04-15 16:46:18 What stocks have you got? Ha ha ha! How hilarious is that?!
418 2018-04-15 16:45:57 Staying away from “hot” stocks worked well for me. Thanks to the legendary Peter Lynch. I am sure his words of wisdom apply today too!
419 2018-04-15 16:45:14 Other stocks on my watchlist in good early entry spots: 

$FIVE $GOOS $VEEV $LGND $AAXN $SITE $NOAH $FND $ATHM $WIX.

Tons of great charts out there but if the market turns strongly positive, those listed are in stellar LT risk/return positions.
420 2018-04-15 16:44:39 Another NY(SE) related story: are we going to let Carl Icahn just get away with shortselling 32M in aluminum stocks using probable insider trading info from 45?
421 2018-04-15 16:44:03 Specially ARM ( adjusted rate mortgages) would face high intetest payments; for corporate- more than 50 firms in S&P 500 index has exposure to adjusted rate debt so performance of stocks would be hit . So borrowing rates rise but recession NO
422 2018-04-15 16:42:21 When was the last mass shooting in Russia? Did the kids have to march because the adults that should be protecting them are out having lunch with lobbyists? How about the Senate and Congress that own stocks in the companies they investigate?
423 2018-04-15 16:41:10 No bull. My stocks are up, except GE. They hurt my portfolio
424 2018-04-15 16:40:46 Unless your a fool your stocks gained almost 20% last year and are up a few percentage points this year. At worse you should be looking at double digit gains over the first 2 years of trump’s presidency.

439 2018-04-15 16:32:35 What they did to Brenda was criminal in my view. Talk about abuse of power. You can't make what you believe illegal - but they'd like to. A whole group conspired to silence us - SKY, Gamble, SummersSwan Brunt & #mccann to stick us in the public stocks. Police were not impressed.
440 2018-04-15 16:32:28 you picked the wrong stocks, O J!
441 2018-04-15 16:31:48 Shouldn't our hard-working Hoosiers get to keep more of their money than someone who makes it speculating on stocks and real-estate?

449 2018-04-15 16:20:18 Amazon’s stock has shown itself to be vulnerable to political machinations and, though it’s unlikely anything could be done to further regulate it, the threat is there. For buyers thinking long-term, this could lead to some good opportunities to catch Amazon stocks at low rates.

And, every person isn’t as lucky as you, no 401, no stocks, just paycheck to paycheck. Please open your eyes!

460 2018-04-15 16:06:25 See this is something no one is talking about (atleast not on my tl) i seriously dont think these line charts are strong enough indication that somethings irrational or off bc other songs copy eachother too.

463 2018-04-15 16:04:30 I would not touch futures to start in any capacity, unless your goal is a home run trade -- esp w/ swing trading. Just pull up a GC, CL, etc daily chart and see if you were wrong, what could it look like? 

Keep in mind futures trade $10 (or so) per TICK. Stocks trade .01.

482 2018-04-15 15:51:50 The other alternative is giving chemical weapons to the rebels so they can attack. There's a reason why Israel maintains chemical weapon stocks. Also, they were debating up until the minute before, what the objective of the strikes were actually going to be

What i think that is will come very slowly and will take so many years. So if someone dream about 100 for stock, it's no more from dream.
494 2018-04-15 15:43:03 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses

521 2018-04-15 15:17:17 So, If what you are saying is accurate as regards these facilities. You've just released any chemical and biological weapons they may have had in containment  into the surrounding atmosphere.
Isn't that a bit dumb? What is the expected body count from releasing these toxin stocks
522 2018-04-15 15:15:54 Best of luck for ur future 
523 2018-04-15 15:15:19 The Assad regime is close to taking back control. This was the time to try to ensure he didn't use his chemical weapons again. He hadn't destroyed stocks
524 2018-04-15 15:14:53 @Gooniesgirl78
Shipping Lines stocks you've bought.
525 2018-04-15 15:14:22 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone so far.
526 2018-04-15 15:13:03 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks slump
527 2018-04-15 15:12:05 And stock buybacks will artificially inflate the price of those stocks and when reality hits home they will lose value profoundly affecting those workers whose retirement investments were in those stocks.

And the cycle will repeat...
528 2018-04-15 15:11:16 Stocks STILL in uptrend Albert, m to l term.

530 2018-04-15 15:06:52 1) The point of these strikes is to take out stocks of chem weapons, and places of manufacture. Not an Iraqi style invasion so @realDonaldTrump is correct in his old tweet.

2) Russia has a veto on UN Security Council, which they effectively use, that route is a fail.

532 2018-04-15 15:02:52 Long short model is long stocks and neutralizes Beta by shorting SPY (only doing US stocks). Long realized vol, is just a scaling algorithm that buys and shorts QQQ and SPY. They have both been highly profitable...
533 2018-04-15 15:02:39 There's evidence that the Assad regime didn't destroy the stocks of chemical weapons.
534 2018-04-15 15:02:12 I hope every publicly traded company stocks fall on their face. Just my opinion as they all have paid off are wonderful corrupt government!! I say it's time for a revolution in this country and for all of us to take it back from career politicians.

536 2018-04-15 15:00:23 Wage increases aren’t the alternative to dividend increases, business investment is. Inflated stocks are only taxed when realized.
537 2018-04-15 14:58:30 Record stocks. Record minority employment. Lower taxes.  Record stocks. ISIS defeated. Less illegal immigration.  Better trade. NK on path to denuclearization. Draining the swamp.
538 2018-04-15 14:58:17 I think stocks $ES_F $NQ_F $YM_F should move much higher, I mean historically this upcoming expiration week 4/20 has been extremely bullish! *But - if stocks don’t rally - my favorite places to hide are: Gold $GC_F, Bitcoin $BTC, VIX $VX_F, US Treasuries $ZN_F & Swiss Franc $CHF.
539 2018-04-15 14:55:55 Again, I'd agree, but I can think of a few hundred less problematic stocks than $GE right now, and I sure would like to sleep soundly next Thursday night.

544 2018-04-15 14:49:51 At least your city trucks are still working. Most snow removal contracts in Ontario ended April 1st--so the ice storm we're in won't be cleared up or streets salted/sanded! And stocks of salt were put away.
545 2018-04-15 14:49:12 All @Starbucks stockholders need to complain on the impact this will have to their stocks. #fireemployee #tellhowthiswonthappenagain #changepolicy
546 2018-04-15 14:47:41 We have to keep in mind the chance of graphite stocks going 'out of favour'. Over the long term canvas, this could just be a 'jump'.
547 2018-04-15 14:44:25 I believe ARTX would be one of those type of stocks. I had them last year when we launched strikes against Syria’s Air Force and it jumped the following week to a new high.

551 2018-04-15 14:42:54 Thanks brother. I was also told to look into missile stocks and stuff like that depending if North Korea actually wants us to defend them.
552 2018-04-15 14:41:33 Barron’s article about supply/demand fears, negative speculation of Canadian market was stupid, wrong. Canadian legal market is more advanced than US. Stocks positioned for upside explosion if legalized this year. Go Canada!
553 2018-04-15 14:40:31 Low unemployment, record employment for blacks, pay increases, record stocks, less illegal immigration, ISIS defeated, better trade.  Yup, America is doing horribly.

555 2018-04-15 14:39:04 I’m sure, ...otherwise I would have heard of it haha! No big deal, we’ll all see what’s going on 5pm tonight anyhow. I can’t really figure out if stocks are going to gap higher or lower... either will likely fade.
556 2018-04-15 14:38:49 This statement from that article isn't even wrong: "value investing boils down to selecting stocks with the lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or lowest price-to-book (P/B) ratio." It is instead investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value.
557 2018-04-15 14:38:27 Fine, exile, put ‘em in stocks - whatever we need to do for me to drive a cool 85 at all times
558 2018-04-15 14:37:49 Canadian stocks have been jumping. We have brilliant commodities companies.
559 2018-04-15 14:36:27 It would only have been a problem if they had stocks of chemical agent in them. They didn't, and the knew they didn't.
560 2018-04-15 14:35:31 Definitely do the stock market if you invest now and stocks go up even when ur son gets older he can have partial share of the stock and he can be good on the money part too. Just make a wise investment..you can start off small and see how it works then from there go up
561 2018-04-15 14:35:25 These changes went into effect several weeks ago. Even while the ink wasn’t dry yet, corporations bought back stocks etc from day one.
562 2018-04-15 14:35:24 Yup. It turns out that actual effective policy means two things: a variety of housing stocks, and sufficient supply to keep prices low, and massive efforts to raise wages across the board. 

It amazes me how often we miss one or both of those things in activism.

579 2018-04-15 14:23:34 Great read Pat, thank you for sharing! One thing I don’t really think we’ve (the team) have talked about is do you have a 5% rule when it breaks out? It’s important to be close to the pivot as possible. But the best stocks will run. Curious on your thoughts!

581 2018-04-15 14:22:20 No, neither of us are that unique. The men that are sometimes identified as representing "all men" are, at times, the outliers - but are put in the stocks by those who wish to build their brand by throwing their tomatoes.

603 2018-04-15 14:03:04 LMAO extremely true. Our generations biggest issue is patience. We expect immediate gratification. This is a great example. Other examples include the "get-rich-quick" craze behind weed stocks and cryptos.

644 2018-04-15 13:21:04 I detest stock markets. They should be legally classified as casinos. Right when stocks are high only those who invest reap the benefit. When they go down even a barber in Tunisia feel the pain. If misery poverty is connected to stock downfall than its high should benefit all.

653 2018-04-15 13:07:26 The video has too many, just too many factual errors. Jayant Bhandari says India inflation is 8%, stock market earnings 4%. Even banks give 8% interest in India, stocks are over 15%. Seems like a disgruntled investor's rant against India.

659 2018-04-15 13:00:46 @EspaceDesLuttes Bonjour, j'ai publié une pétition sur facebook pour soutenir les stocks américains de Valenciennes.Nous sommes quelques insoumis ds cambrésis prêts à nous mobiliser devant pôle emploi Valenciennes pour dénoncer ce scandale.
660 2018-04-15 12:59:31 I liked : “A move up to $1,500 (or just a 12% gain from current levels) will likely lead to a 50-75% increase in GDXJ. That's the type of leverage these stocks have at the moment.”
661 2018-04-15 12:58:25 To put a finer point on it: those stats apply to *assessed* stocks, right? So the % of *all* fisheries overexploited may well be higher, but we don’t know. If there aren’t enough data to assess them, it seems a non-crazy assumption that they aren’t (well) managed.
662 2018-04-15 12:56:48 If stocks has updated their wallets you can. Otherwise you'll have to ask them to update

680 2018-04-15 12:37:43 It is useful to have a default position or a benchmark.  In the UK the FTSE 250 is probably the best index for passive investing.  If you can’t find stocks then why not invest in that?  A “next best alternative” helps support investment discipline.

683 2018-04-15 12:36:29 I love stocks. They brighten up the garden and smell gorgeous
684 2018-04-15 12:33:46 You know the stocks dropped when every poll showed Obama would win? October into November of 08. I remember it fondly as my 401 dropped 40% in a month. Also, I had insurance before Obama but started paying quadruple after his nice insurance change.
685 2018-04-15 12:33:42 Love this. Most advisers can’t read income statements or balance sheets, it’s just about indexing today. I agree individual stocks can make you rich, take you to 1,000 or 0, and teach lessons you never forget.

687 2018-04-15 12:30:37 The PM is elected in the first instance (via democratic process) to MP and then elected by the party as leader. The nation effectively elects the PM by electing the MPs. 

Perhaps it's semantics given that, either way, the PM makes decisions on behalf of the nation via democracy.

760 2018-04-15 10:50:15 If the UK knows of unconfirmed stocks it is obliged by international law to report them to the OPCW and take measures through the UNSC, not bomb Syria.
761 2018-04-15 10:49:23 Exactly
If stocks had been hit would have dispersed & killed 1000s especially as one was in Damascus
Ipso facto there were none.

762 2018-04-15 10:49:04 Bien entendu qu'il y a des armes chimiques... Après on peut éventuellement dire qu'on n'est pas sûr de qui les a utilisées. L'intervention occidentale s'est limitée à détruire des stocks sans tuer personne : où est le problème ?

767 2018-04-15 10:44:09 Bombing stockpiles of toxic chemicals would be a bit of a dumb move, spreading them over the countryside! In this instance, I would suggest it was known to be safe because it was known there were no stocks.
768 2018-04-15 10:43:00 "une escalade irresponsable" : juste des stocks d'armes chimiques détruits et zéro morts... ce n'est en rien une escalade, c'est une réponse très mesurée à une utilisation répétée (plus de 50 fois) d'armes chimiques #Syrie #mélenchon

774 2018-04-15 10:37:38 En réalité les armes chimiques des Syriens sont fabriquées en France ... il s'agit des vieux restes de pinard , stocks que même les alcoolos ne veulent plus !
775 2018-04-15 10:36:51 Oui enfin surtout LEUR gouvernement qui les massacre depuis des années, hélas... Les frappes occidentales visaient des stocks de munitions chimiques et ont fait 0 victimes.

777 2018-04-15 10:35:01 @EmmanuelMacron enfreignent le traité sur les armes chimiques, il est précisé qu'il faut au préalable obtenir les preuves du délit selon une procédure définie. L'attaque franco-anglo-américaine est donc litigieuse en regard du droit international. USA, UK ont tjrs des stocks. 2/2
778 2018-04-15 10:24:45 I think several times in the past the us has carried out selective air strikes on chemical weapon factories  or stocks and Assad has continued to gas his people so how will it be different this time? also russia is now involved this ups the anti
779 2018-04-15 10:23:39 Ali, put your tin foil helmet on for this one but I have read that Putin got Trump to bomb Syria to destroy stocks of chemical weapons that had Russia’s ‘fingerprints’ all over them before the UN inspectors could identify them. Meanwhile, back in the real world...

786 2018-04-15 10:11:27 Les personnes ne sont pas les cibles mais @EmmanuelMacron avait notifié qu'en cas d'utilisation d'armes chimiques il y aurait des représailles.

788 2018-04-15 10:10:45 Momentum is largely about sentiment and changes in the P/E ratio.  It does also, though, reflect progress on the fundamentals.  Momentum stocks are often more expensive.  A useful approach is to identify momentum early on and then buy in if the fundamentals add up.

794 2018-04-15 10:04:56 Splitting holdings over several accounts has to go to be a prudent move. The potential of  your stocks being locked up for 6+ months is enough reason to use multiple accounts.  Hedging is possible, but only if you know you’re getting your assets back 100% in shares.
795 2018-04-15 10:03:59 In relation to #momentum, have you found that this affected your own holding period? Have you maintained /held any #stocks consistently throughout your #investing five year timeframe? If, so? How have they performed in comparison to your annualise portfolio performance?

816 2018-04-15 09:31:37 Has anyone asserted their stocks have been eliminated?
817 2018-04-15 09:30:52 Exactly so not everyone necessarily should follow a benchmark.  The number of stocks held also a big factor. No point following a benchmark with only a few holdings
818 2018-04-15 09:30:26 Arrêtez de nous prendre pour des imbéciles! imaginez une seule seconde quel aurait été les conséquences d’un bombardement si il y avait eu réellement des stocks chimiques sur les lieux bombardés.

Meanwhile, the United States did not destroy its chemical weapons. . Assad destroyed all stocks of chemical weapons. And the international organization OPCW, confirmed this fact.

898 2018-04-15 07:54:08 @CanonRSA  just bought a 1DX. Batter just stops after a bit of time. Some say battery calibration ,,, I did that. But still it stops. Dead. After about an hours shoot. What is the answer. Get a new battery...??? Who stocks them here in Port Elizabeth....?? Best way to calibrate
899 2018-04-15 07:54:01 Summer is on. The heat is on. And I'm replenishing stocks on the #Midsummer2018 ticket outlets coz some of them drained out. A gentle breeze would be nice around town today.

909 2018-04-15 07:40:16 L'avantage de Trump, Poutine, Macron, May et les autres est que leurs stocks d'armes chimiques, aériennes, terrestres, que sais-je, sont "légales", utilisables et utilisées à l'infini, avec ou sans aval de l'ONU
910 2018-04-15 07:39:39 It was never intended to damage either side in this conflict. It was about chemical weapons and the accurate destruction of stocks & research facilities ensures that these stockpiles will not be used and hopefully, might make the world more reluctant to deploy them in the future.
911 2018-04-15 07:36:46 Are you aware "noble" USA is refusing to destroy THEIR OWN CHEMICAL WEAPONS stocks?
Syrian govt is winning, slowly but surely. Douma was to be libarated from Jaish Al-Islam (who used chem weapons on ISIS few years back!) in few more days. It would be STUPID to use chem. weapons.
912 2018-04-15 07:33:43 And what are the high weight stocks.
913 2018-04-15 07:31:40 What relationship between share price on the long run and research & development ? A positive relationship. If we accept such prediction, then investment should be made in the stocks of the companies which invest the more in R&D

To cut profits early and be happy about it. But maybe verge is going to exit scam

958 2018-04-15 05:49:49 It's interesting that they can go for cheaper maize from Uganda, whereas we still have large stocks of it in our houses. What's the essence of a Kenyan farmer going to the farm and fail to sell the same? Let's have priority to the farmer first and exhaust their stocks

969 2018-04-15 05:27:59 Even more interesting they bombed the Barzeh facility - allegedly containing stocks of chemical weapons. They claim they 'mitigated' the resultant with modeling (huh?). The wind was blowing directly towards Al-Assad suburb and tens of thousands were in the immediate kill zone. /
970 2018-04-15 05:24:39 You were saying? Where did all you pumpers/ believers go? Where's Frank the affinity scammer? Where's PJ? These three scams died on the vine quicker than most suspended stocks. No cult stock here. Sad to say, but I, of course, was right all along.
971 2018-04-15 05:23:34 Your distorted thinking will always keep you poor. The stock market has gone up 200% just since 2008. That’s if you did nothing & just put your money in the Dow 30 stocks. I have lived off the stock market for years, others become multi-millionaires an even billionaires from it.
972 2018-04-15 05:23:05 @screener_in by any chance can we an option to change the comparable companies in the table. 

Also can you please suggest the API that you use to pull list of stocks and EOD prices.
973 2018-04-15 05:19:01 30k in stocks is an example.And there are people investing a few thousands in stocks and making money out of it, so if i put 30K into the right stock, it’ll make me money for sure (if it goes well)Like i said about businesses, you have to do research before investing in anything
974 2018-04-15 05:17:08 Right but you might throw $20k at someone’s business and lose it all (most businesses go broke in less than a year) and $20k in stocks aint really moving much.
975 2018-04-15 05:16:47 Thank you 
976 2018-04-15 05:15:36 and that 1M i invest in can be spread out in so many different things. I can literally invest 20K into someone’s business (or give it as a loan), i can spend 30K on stocks, i can spend 300K on real estate AND ILL STILL HAVE MAD MONEY LEFT out of that 1M.
977 2018-04-15 05:14:51 This is Feb information ,when trading in Singapore exchange for Indian stocks was banned ,leading to earnings risk,this is resolved now
978 2018-04-15 05:13:38 My alternative strategy would include things like not broadcasting to them via Twitter to be sure to move any chemical stocks or equipment before we launch air strikes. Secondly, if we really care about those children we should give them refugee status and protect them here.

1037 2018-04-15 03:30:29 Do you really not understand what “practice what you preach” mean? No, I don’t own stocks but I do invest in forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps, and other derivatives which do not rely on the presidency.

1039 2018-04-15 03:26:55 (1/3) In my research I am now firmly convinced American socialists will start a massive movement for government to provide citizens “free money”; aka: a “sovereign wealth fund,” whereby government scoops up ownership of the economy by doing something simple like buying stocks.

1062 2018-04-15 02:46:14 This is true, but at least everything has dropped a lot. Stocks like $CHV ran to .90 and now at .25 market cap is reasonable vs others in the sector..and im currently under water on CHV for full disclosure
1063 2018-04-15 02:45:43 The only regret I have on social security is the G W Bush plan to allow investing part of trust fund money into a 401K or Money fund or stocks to get a higher return on the money paid into the system. Glad Paul Ryan is leaving perhaps he will learn the difference between an

1068 2018-04-15 02:38:48 I pay property tax and I fall well within the $10,000 cap, I was sitting at a $19 return just based on my W-2s until I entered that, and uhm traditional IRA. It's nice to have assets that just naturally float up cause the stocks that I can just dump money to an IRA

1095 2018-04-15 01:56:33 2 months ago I sold 120 shares of avid stocks and I’ve never thought back on it once.
1096 2018-04-15 01:56:15 Far from a promoter. Isn't all stocks  promotional.   Either be small or big all of them has some part of marketing . That's fact .
1097 2018-04-15 01:55:13 Unhinged. Please take away his AR15, magazines and bump stocks. Immediately.

1099 2018-04-15 01:51:01 Simply not true. My stocks and investments started going up throughout the Obama presidency and simply continued into the Trump administration.
1100 2018-04-15 01:50:44 Halting at the height of the mania, trapping so many traders. The OI in options (most of these stocks wouldn't have options). The media coverage. The other reasons you mentioned. Multi billion dollar valuation. Recent IPO. Sloppy filings. It's absolutely bizarre

1103 2018-04-15 01:48:22 We handled the Depression just fine. No money in stocks. Just bank vaults full of mattresses with money stuffed in.
1104 2018-04-15 01:47:07 Using this chart for BTC is probably not right. Unlike stocks or any other security, BTC has no intrinsic value/rate of return. It is impossible to give it a fair book value in which smart money comes in to prop up a rally. No value investment opportunity w/ btc
1105 2018-04-15 01:46:19 Both Bloomberg and CNBC have become noticeably political in the stocks they either endorse or criticize. The days of objectivity in any media have disappeared and the hosts just appear to kowtow to the whims of owners, nothing more than entertainment.

1113 2018-04-15 01:39:48 Raytheon stocks going up on Monday for sure.
1114 2018-04-15 01:37:41 It’s good business for stores though. Everyone stocks up on groceries when they think everything’s going to shut down or before a long weekend.
1115 2018-04-15 01:36:40 I’m not for taking away guns (I’ve got 5 in my House rt now), I think we can do some things to mitigate these types of incidents.  High capacity magazines, bump stocks, better background checks.  I also think it’s a very sensitive issue
1116 2018-04-15 01:35:55 We went down with 2 cars to race with the Modern Stocks, the old 6 cylinder division for the 80 or 81 turkey Derby.  I didn't change my Long Island gear so I was way over geared and had to shift and in the consi my pressure plate broke, didn't finish.

1164 2018-04-15 00:40:32 The Whales are a convenient scapegoat for mans greed and stupidity. There was a similar cry during the 1960's when the factory trawlers started the decline in "Cod" fish stocks in the North Atlantic Ocean !
They took too much "through GREED" and started blaming "SEALS"

1166 2018-04-15 00:39:38 That is definitely one of the
stupidest comparisons I've ever
read. Someone needs to sell their
stocks while they still have some
  value so they can relax.

1175 2018-04-15 00:30:22 And I was about to buy Starbucks stocks . Ooooops, not any more.
1176 2018-04-15 00:28:08 The PMO/MACD on indexes and many stocks looks like it's going to roll over - a very bearish indication during a market/stock pullback.  It won't take long for the crossover to fail.
1177 2018-04-15 00:25:53 Regarding this whole gun control push that's been going on, I just want to say I wholly blame the @NRA - they caved on bump stocks after Vegas, and since then the grabbers have felt compelled to go for broke and take what they can.

Give them an inch, and they'll take a mile.
1178 2018-04-15 00:25:23 The profit margin on funnel cakes at Caraway Speedway has to be like 1000% because the announcer mentions them every five minutes.

Do the drivers get paid by funnel cake sales? Is that why there were only 8 mods and 3 street stocks tonight?
1179 2018-04-15 00:21:27 I spent hours yesterday going through all the available warrants on silver stocks. Not that many. $ASM
1180 2018-04-15 00:20:14 Yes, and given where they are now, that should be extremely frightening for anyone who is long stocks (without some plan to get out of the way before the bear hits). It also shows there is great opportunity on the short side if you can get the timing right and manage the risks.
1181 2018-04-15 00:19:33 I buy silver coins + ETFs + miner stocks. (but stocks can go to zero if miners go bankrupt - because of suppression that did happen to me)
1182 2018-04-15 00:18:59 I meet people all the time who trade stocks, and funny enough, none of them have ever lost money.  They've all traded bubble stocks and made money.  Maybe one day I'll be just as good, and I can start selling mentorship programs on Instagram.  #HappyWeekend
1183 2018-04-15 00:18:10 I'll chime in if you don't mind... Stay away from futures, esp to start. The biggest, well funded sharks swim there and will eat you alive.

IMO stocks offer a huge advantage - incredible volatility every day. Up to you how to play but if you find them, incredible opportunity.
1184 2018-04-15 00:16:44 Cheney received $34M when he left, in stocks, options and bonus.
1185 2018-04-15 00:15:46 I wonder ..... Did Marcos Alonso think 'Hiiiiiiii Yaaaaaah' when he tried to separate Shane Longs lower leg from his knee @djdaco @ChelseaFC good comeback though tbf; mutter.
1186 2018-04-15 00:15:31 I think it was clearer in 2007-08 but far from clear in 2000.  In 2000, the economy was strong, but stocks tanked anyway. Ditto with 1929. Ditto with early 1970s.
1187 2018-04-15 00:15:05 ... and that shall suffice for today. Energy stocks and oil saw powerful gains this past week, clearly helped via middle east issues.

1189 2018-04-15 00:13:29 Theoretically possible, but give me a single historical example in the US or anywhere else. High valuations have always resolved in big bear markets. If earnings tank in a recession, stocks will tank regardless of how low interest rates are.

1191 2018-04-15 00:12:20 Well, in a recession earnings go down.. you clearly don’t want to be long stocks at the onset of a recession and generally its clear when market starts going down for macroeconomic cycle reasons vs a normal ebb and flow
1192 2018-04-15 00:11:54 Well, 2 b fair, they havent even capitalized at all...much less truly capitalize. Looking at a list of teams who have won about the same or less p.o. games in the last 20 yrs puts it into perspective. Those teams are generally considered laughing stocks. Cle, cin, buf, det, etc

1196 2018-04-15 00:10:11 Investing into stocks, bonds, and stuff in your own account is sort of like multi-tasking.

Apparently 70 civilians were murdered by chemical weapons and nerve agents. 500 injured.

1202 2018-04-15 00:06:07 Apology accepted, however, your stocks will fall.
1203 2018-04-15 00:03:50 Its impossible to say it's the wrong decision as (I suspect) noone has the intelligence other than those who made the decision.
1204 2018-04-15 00:02:14 Not in the least! ANC reported that the Russian press stated the White House (Trump) called Russia (Putin) telling them to move all their stuff. You know he told his buddy Assad...and the missile attack was an Impotent display for his base (and his Raytheon stocks).
1205 2018-04-15 00:02:12 OK, fair enough--you're a tactical guy so valuations don't matter. No argument then. But let's not pretend that valuations aren't high or that stocks always go up 10% a year in the long-term regardless of valuation are macro/growth. I'm tactical too right now.

1255 2018-04-14 23:14:13 Well some of the stocks I’ve been looking at went down
1256 2018-04-14 23:09:46 I must admit to be somewhat worried by the way the #markets reacted after the stellar #earnings reports on Friday #stocks #StockMarket #investments #investing #Finance #thestreet #WallStreet #economics
1257 2018-04-14 23:08:25 Yeah, I haven't heard anyone talk about 3D Printing stocks in years. I remember $DDD 's prolific run up. HP has some damn good 3D printers too.
1258 2018-04-14 23:06:33 I'd probably make it a Souls inspired thing? Could use covenants in place of stocks and I think it'd still work pretty well.
1259 2018-04-14 23:04:56 I was shot in a drive by shooting with a shot gun. I still have over  50 pellets in my arm and chest.  I also have a CCL and  I'm usually armed. So my agenda is some common sense licensing, registration, mandatory safety classes and banning bump stocks and automatic weapons.
1260 2018-04-14 23:03:22 I had to sell it. Stocks went low
1261 2018-04-14 23:02:20 I did. I was commenting on the below comments that state there is some grand conspiracy not to find cures. Cures bring in money and raise stocks in a company. It's not all about the actual dollar amount one drug sells. You have to take all factors into account.
1262 2018-04-14 22:59:57 I'm going to make an effort to start tweeting again. I also like the CRISPR gene editing stocks or any gene editing company whether they use adeno viruses or zinc fingers to insert / remove the genes. DNA is code / information.
1263 2018-04-14 22:58:05 I just read something... said that attacks were after 5pm on Friday so gold couldn’t be bought and stocks couldn’t dump...now they will say it’s over... I suppose since you have the Zionist theory opinon. I suppose you are not an Alex Jones fan.

Unlimited fast repairs and all cars must keep forward momentum.

1275 2018-04-14 22:28:07 So it looks like now we need to wait on the OCC to issue positive exercise instructions. Leaving brokers off the hook and everything in the hands of the OCC? This is a mess. $LFIN has been one of the most interesting stocks I’ve ever seen.
1276 2018-04-14 22:27:49 If it's so easy to take out Assad's stocks of weapons without civilian casualties:
Q. Why have so many civilians died in the Syrian war?
Q. Why has Assad still got chemical weapons? It's not like this is the first time he's used them.
Q. Why didn't May consult Parliament?
1277 2018-04-14 22:25:40 Study and learn how u want to trade. Then do it. Tweak it as u go. But Don't make a change to your plan because u made an error. This is a big mistake that will keep u chasing your tail. Adjust your trading to make it better!! #goodluck #patience #ES_F #stocks

1283 2018-04-14 22:19:21 She might have, but she'd have worked WITH France and UK to attack the chem weapon stocks as those nations did and not put on a show over empty airfields as #45 just did.  There is a humanitarian crisis for some, and a wag the dog moment for others.
1284 2018-04-14 22:19:02 HD1 plays like older Warrior sticks. Reminds me of a DD. Warrior pro stocks are way better than retail sticks if you can find them, but they still tend to break at the blade
1285 2018-04-14 22:18:36 If you wonder why Hitler did not use chemical weapons, he feared that the weapons if used by field commanders would trigger allied retaliation (the allied had double the stocks), his own WW1 experience and the fact the logistics still depended on horses

1305 2018-04-14 21:48:52 some laws that we want: bans on high capacity magazines, bans on weapon modifiers, including bump stocks, universal background checks, longer waiting periods, and personal referals. this is just some of thr laws we want. none of which would infringe on your rights.

1307 2018-04-14 21:44:55 Actually Starbucks is not funded by govt $$.  It’s by individuals who own stocks shares etc.  Those people set policy not the “public”.

1332 2018-04-14 21:22:03 can you explain how the UK and USA are threatened by the use of chemical weapons in Syria? Also, the USA uses phosphorous against civilians, agent orange against civilians, napalm against civilians and the Syrian stocks of Sarin were supplied by...drumroll...UK, in 2012!
1333 2018-04-14 21:20:51 Mmm, aligerar stocks.

Difícil saberlo pero,entre eeuu,Francia y UK tendrán centenares de miles...

1334 2018-04-14 21:20:42 Of course they know what he’s up to. That’s why they keep pushing for a full UN inspection and keep getting vetoed by Russia. Eight times now! Russia even took on a UN mandate to destroy Assad’s chemical weapons stocks and clearly did nothing.
1335 2018-04-14 21:20:38 Lest we forget, the people who really benefit from the occasional bombing run/targeted missile strikes from a countries government are the ones with shares and stocks in arms companies.

1344 2018-04-14 21:09:46 War cries can bring about unwanted spurt in commodity prices coupled with  rise in shipping rates and even their insurance premium! Such stocks need to be watched next week !
1345 2018-04-14 21:09:14 Are we supposed to believe that Syrian stocks of chemical weapons and weapon-making expertise have been stored in a place known to the West and that Assad hasn't taken the opportunity of the last week to move them? They must think we are monkeys #bbcnews

1348 2018-04-14 21:06:04 C'est ce que j'ai eu en tête dés l'annonce de l'attaque, je ne savais pas que c'était ainsi qu'on détruisait des stocks de nombreux composants de gaz chimique mortel.
J'ai du rater un épisode... Ou alors il n'y avait que des produits normaux et tranquilles.
1349 2018-04-14 21:04:55 With #BoycottStarbucks trending, hopefully their stocks go down so I can get a decent discount per share.

1357 2018-04-14 20:54:47 Donc si je comprends bien, on a détruit les stocks de produits chimiques et autres gaz de Assad. Ok.

1362 2018-04-14 20:51:04 Only regret I have is that I failed to file an EEO and a formal company complaint. Chances are I would've lost but I would've fought. I hope these two men sue the company. Time to sell the last of my stocks.

1365 2018-04-14 20:50:08 She said she did this in the national interest without actually bothering to figure out what the interest is. That is done by asking parliament who represent the country and who are informed by their constituents. Basic stuff for her but she ignores it
1366 2018-04-14 20:49:45 Another point is that 5-6 tech stocks are driving the increases (Facebook, alphabet, Amazon)

So the index and their funds are misleading.  If those stock drop off the index plummets

Really doesn't prove economy is great

1391 2018-04-14 20:31:23 Niet helemaal, zij rapporteerde dat 92,5% was vernietigd. Dan blijft er nog wat over. Volgens mij had zij geen controle over de chemische stocks bij rebellen en die hadden later weer terug bij Assad kunnen komen, heeft inmiddels behoorlijk wat terrein terug gewonnen.
1392 2018-04-14 20:30:06 C’est vrai,il aurait fallu laisser le temps à bachar de déménager ses stocks de réserves chimique avant que la commission ne débarque pour enquêter.

1397 2018-04-14 20:24:05 So, this rally in stocks should be good enough until Q3, or elections.  But, it will be quite difficult to beat any earnings boost by the tax cuts in 2019. So, any rally back up to stratosphere in 2018 is highly likely to fail with any downside surprise. Just thinking out loud...

1421 2018-04-14 20:03:05 In a market in decline better to buy stocks that are a premium over a week old price.

1425 2018-04-14 19:59:00 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump That would be cuz trickle down doesn’t work! Many said from beginning the companies might give out some 1 time bonuses but they would NOT do permanent wage increases, instead would buy back stocks & give The big shots bonuses!  Exactly what has happened!
1426 2018-04-14 19:57:08 Sold all my stocks.

1442 2018-04-14 19:46:15 DJT's 1st HHS Sec traded blithely (& v conveniently) in stocks his legislation affected, & apparently also perjured himself in confirmation hearing (Successor Azar was a longtime swamp creature, helped Eli Lilly on both sides of revolving door, tho dunno if technically criminal).
1443 2018-04-14 19:46:14 PSU Banking stocks should be sold at every rise as not much can be expected in the next 6months. May be return after 2nd Qtr results are announced.!
1444 2018-04-14 19:43:43 I said one, but ok.

Show me proof of your raise.

401k and stocks are related, so that makes sense, but trump hasn't implemented policies which have cause the gains.

Bombing Syria isn't good. It didn't work for Obama, it didn't work for trump last year, it won't work now.

1454 2018-04-14 19:30:42 Sections of #Labour have recently  made it apparent that gassing of humans is more tolerable than destroying chemical stocks that have been used for that purpose
1455 2018-04-14 19:29:50 Au contraire - wasn't covered by agreement with Syria to dispose of chemical weapon stocks a few years ago because is has many civil uses
1456 2018-04-14 19:29:14 If you have money, you can buy REITs, ETFs, stocks.

You will definitely either invest money or time. Time is likely at the start.
1457 2018-04-14 19:28:30 Ils ont visé des stocks d'armes chimiques. Bases évacuées 3 jours avant, pas de victimes. Ça n'a rien à voir avec "bombarder la Syrie" !

1459 2018-04-14 19:27:38 While many would like to exit some of the small cap stocks, they are probably stuck in trying to know as to when to do so. Decisive Actions are better taken then not! Try and EXIT on the next rise of 100-200pts on Nifty!
1460 2018-04-14 19:26:28 The JIM had also found the regime responsible for previous chlorine gas attacks. OPCW/JIM was never asked to assign responsibility for Ghouta 2013, but reports say it found unique chemical markers matching it to regime's sarin stocks.
1461 2018-04-14 19:26:24 However if you buy a property in Detroit - it's got nowhere to go but up - If it doesn't you still retain most of your investment which is why real estate is safer than stocks but slower growth

1469 2018-04-14 19:20:47 Amen. It’s great to see others that are respected stand up and support the microcap space. Far too much glorification of VC and far too much condemnation of small company stocks today. It’s always been something that is mind boggling to me.

1477 2018-04-14 19:14:28 I am looking for S&P movements around 2680, could indicate next direction. 200 MA is a strong line, but neither this nor Dow Theory is absolute. Both stocks and oil look overvalued, but that could last for years.

1480 2018-04-14 19:12:13 Je ne comprends pas votre discours, il est établi, prouvé et personne ne conteste que B. El Assad a déjà eu recours a des armes chimiques contre des civils en 2013 et 2017. De même, les stocks d'armes chimiques de Damas auraient du être détruits en juin 2014. En convenez-vous ?
1481 2018-04-14 19:12:13 The conspiracy theorist in me is telling me Russia will be pulling money from crypto to fund defending Syria. Also telling me to buy into oil stocks before the time that USA controls Syria 100%

1556 2018-04-14 18:02:22 @hainsworthtv looks like you are in 40's midlife crisis(rethink).  I'm curious.  Did you quit trading stocks because  nobody could beat buying s&p over 10yrs? Thus all the people you interviewed were blowing hot air?

1571 2018-04-14 17:52:02 So we're going to catch 6-8 times more fish than currently caught without depleting fish stocks, still having access to European markets (without tariffs) and eating significantly more fish ourselves?

This claim smells a little fishy...

Did you get the numbers from Farage?
1572 2018-04-14 17:50:46 What was the mission? And what did it accomplish? Is Assad still in power? Are his stocks of chemical weapons still unaccounted for? Is his ability to kill his own people at all diminished? Wake up POTUS.

1580 2018-04-14 17:42:26 I wonder if you could make a sustainable VC fund that sought out lower risk, lower reward investments (but still higher risk and reward than public stocks). Or pursue different funding structures—somewhere between a bank and a VC.

1587 2018-04-14 17:37:36 Of over 50 chem attacks only 3 attributed to Assad's army. One has to wonder why he waited so long to use his stocks when Russia garuntees victory? Maybe the Ruskies needed to seal a ground to air defence system sale?
1588 2018-04-14 17:36:55 @theresa_may A question, then? If the targeted strike has set back a chemical weapon program and destroyed stocks, it appears 'we' must have known about them for some time. So why didn't we express our moral outrage and take action before people were murdered by them?

By the time people see that he might be working against us it will be to late. The OmniBus was a big loss.
1604 2018-04-14 17:24:06 A question, then? If the targeted strike has set back a chemical weapon program and destroyed stocks, it appears 'we' knew about them for some time. So why didn't we express our moral outrage and take action before people were murdered by them?

1645 2018-04-14 16:52:19 Hard to short stocks and make money if you only use regular brokers such as @etrade @TDAmeritrade or @IBKR. I believe they have a competitive advantage by using Elites (more shares to short) brokers. Also, those brokers required a massive large of capital.

1648 2018-04-14 16:51:11 Careful what you wish for. When the Rwandans plundered cobalt stocks they dumped so much in the market the price went through the floor.
1649 2018-04-14 16:49:35 Does this mean stocks like HDFC Life, D-Mart or Amazon are not ideally suited for retail investors?

Compounders like HDFC Bank will keep defying PE until they maintain quality growth.

IMO periodic review is must for all, more for 'stable & relative' future growth than for PE!

1651 2018-04-14 16:47:30 Most of them are making money on shorting stocks. They’re using special brokers that required more money for shorting stocks. So far, I don’t see none of them making money consistently on Bullish side.

1662 2018-04-14 16:40:06 Where did the nerve agent used in the attack this week come from?

Two possibilities are receiving attention: that the agent, sarin, was in stocks Mr. Assad hid from inspectors, or that weapons specialists in the Syrian government manufactured a new supply. While it is not simple

1669 2018-04-14 16:36:07 Une simple question: comment détruire les stocks de munitions chimiques que nos bons amis djihâdistes ne pouvaient pas emporter, avant que les Syriens ne les découvrent?
1670 2018-04-14 16:36:03 But congressional support for strikes was lukewarm. Russia, seeking to head off American military retaliation, proposed an international effort to document and destroy Syria’s chemical stocks. Mr. Obama, facing possible defeat in Congress, accepted.
1671 2018-04-14 16:35:53 In the UK, the Prime Minister is not elected. The PM is merely the leader of the party which forms a government after a general election.
1672 2018-04-14 16:34:33 1. Abortion isn't murder. The law is clear on that fact. 2. The NRA is a gun lobbist organization. Show me where in the constitution that gun lobbyists are a protected class. 3. Banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines is not an infringement of your 2nd amendment rights.
1673 2018-04-14 16:34:22 Between stocks and my business. I’m not sure right now. I could run my business, do stocks and still work a 9-5
1674 2018-04-14 16:33:10 That one mission last night. Accomplished successful. What mission do think? Freeing Syria fixing Middle East? Truly not that stupid
1675 2018-04-14 16:32:15 1) Peut-être que les Russes auraient du finir le travail auquel ils s’étaient engagés en 2013: supprimer les stocks d’armes chimiques de la région. 2) Appliquer une pensée binaire - bons, méchants - dans cette région du monde est naïf. 1/2
1676 2018-04-14 16:31:40 Stocks not cutting it?
1677 2018-04-14 16:31:03 Kudos to my home state. People like to call us a bunch of flaming liberals but we were the first to ban bump stocks after Vegas. Gay marriage and marijuana are legal and the state has healthcare for all. Massachusetts stands for we the people. I’m proud to be #BostonStrong!!!!!!
1678 2018-04-14 16:26:00 Since Jan. 1, Washington state has:

1. Enacted automatic voter registration
2. Banned bump stocks
3. Mandated birth control coverage
4. Outlawed gay conversion therapy.

1683 2018-04-14 16:21:48 “Obama administration officials say that they always believed Mr. Assad might be withholding at least small chemical supplies, and that in public statements, Mr. Kerry and others tried to refer to the elimination of Syria’s “declared” stocks, a nuance often lost in news reports”
1684 2018-04-14 16:21:28 Plenty of folks are in the red. I’m up by $2k. In Jan/early Feb, I was up by $100k.

1690 2018-04-14 16:13:20 ,@Free_Media_Hub what a sad farce the Trump cautious bombing is. Probably done Friday night. not to rattle stocks. Now he leaves Assad undeterred to continue murdering his people #SyriaStrike #Damascus
1691 2018-04-14 16:13:15 I only suggest the stocks that I buy. I made decent profits until now
1692 2018-04-14 16:09:31 I really don’t even think this is about money with Trump. He did this last year when the news was bad for him, but stocks were surging then. This is all him.
1693 2018-04-14 16:08:27 Or you could ban AR-15s and other assault riffles, have universal background checks, ban bump stocks, have mental health checks, etc. We don’t need more guards to make our schools feel like prisons if we could just take away the bad guy with a gun in the first place

1697 2018-04-14 16:05:43 Airstrikes on Syria have destroyed 'large part' of Assad's chemical weapons stock, says French Foreign minister after US, France and Britain. Certain buildings were certainly destroyed but rest assured, the chemical stocks were moved out 3 days ago!

1725 2018-04-14 15:44:40 Okay let's start with bump stocks, Banning bump stocks wouldn't help at all because you can make a bump so I can using your belt loop. There's no reason to ban high-capacity magazines because most people that own them aren't committing mass shootings.

1727 2018-04-14 15:43:11 No, they are saying that military style weapons should be used by law enforcement or the military, bump stocks should be banned & large capacity magazines or clips should also be prohibited. It’s not exactly far from reasonable.

1740 2018-04-14 15:29:07 But one of the weapons mentioned by the Supremes was military style weapons.  That the right to bear arms was not unlimited.  Certainly bump stocks and anything that can rapid fire enough that crowds don't even have a chance to run would qualify.

1755 2018-04-14 15:12:38 There’s definitely pumping that takes place on Twitter, no question about it.   But in all reality retail investors don’t move stocks a whole lot, it’s institutional investors who do.  So people can pump all they want, won’t do much.

1775 2018-04-14 15:02:24 Trump has declared 'Mission Accomplished' - so, I assume his arms industry stocks and shares have gone up in value.

1780 2018-04-14 14:57:16 Yo te lo digo...liberar el almacén de armas para dejar sitio a las nuevas que oportunamente se compran con dinero público a las grandes empresas armamentísticas.
Gestión de Stocks, se llama. No veas tu la de comisiones que se van a meter en el bolso algunos..
1781 2018-04-14 14:54:10 Thanks Mr. President. God bless my defense stocks again:))))
1782 2018-04-14 14:53:49 les coquilles bombardées avec succés étaient vides depuis 3 jours, les stocks à l'abri, les assassins aussi! pourtant Israel leur avait montré la recette sur la base T4 iranienne, quand on a un missile en main, on ne raconte pas sa vie, on tire!!
1783 2018-04-14 14:53:28 But for now do nothing about his stocks of chemical weapons or ability to produce them. The next victims will be so grateful.
1784 2018-04-14 14:53:28 Yo es que creo que es una problema de gestión de stocks, hay que gastar las armas que se tienen para dejar sitio para las nuevas que oportunamente comprarán a las grandes empresas con dinero público. Para ello han de inventarse una guerra o meterse en una que ya esté en marcha.
1785 2018-04-14 14:53:15 There are times I wish we had the colonial public stocks.  The criminals- obama, michelle, malia, comey, mccabe, holder, lynch, hillary n Bill, rosenstein- struck/strike n gf... would be pillaried for all to see- throw rocks, tomatoes- whatever was handy
1786 2018-04-14 14:53:13 In fact, I know a lot of people say this but I believe it's a rarity, one of those stocks, you won't see very often on AIM.
1787 2018-04-14 14:53:08 China's investors are selling off stocks. Speculation in the US is raising fears of a deep recession, which could have global reach.
1788 2018-04-14 14:48:36 Stocks in the tomahawk manufacturers went up 5b.

1790 2018-04-14 14:47:18 And, since we worship the almighty buck, may Starbuck’s stocks and profits plummet. Amen.
1791 2018-04-14 14:47:07 Tepid, ineffective, nominal, expensive, provocative, and mostly useless.

Syria still has chemical weapons and even more incentive to use them - now that some claim its stocks have been severely damaged. What does Trump say after the next use?
1792 2018-04-14 14:46:38 I'm aware. Chic-fil-a's stocks went up after it came out they were anti gay as well.... America
1793 2018-04-14 14:46:27 High majority of people want background checks, high capacity mags banned, assault rifles banned, bump stocks banned, you can be pro 2A and want these. 2A says well regulated, NRA leadership subverts the will of the people for gun makers profit.
1794 2018-04-14 14:46:17 Good stocks to buy for me of course CVE, ALK, SHO, JNPR, TAP, LPX, FAF, KHC, TRUP, AVAV, BIIB, CMCSA.
What is your opinion, any suggestions?

1796 2018-04-14 14:43:44 The best ways to reduce the risk of rising rates might be the simplest: hold short-term bonds and diversify with stocks.

Since July 2016:
Vanguard Long-Term Bond Index = -3.5%
DFA Five-Year Global Bond = -0.3%
DFA US Large Value = +34.4%
DFA Int’l Value = +49.1%
1797 2018-04-14 14:43:03 what are these stocks why are they up what is happening to my communist friends

1801 2018-04-14 14:41:45 Distraction, yes, but don't forget Emoluments. They were warned and Assad had plenty of time to hide his aircraft in Russian hangers. Trumpty and buds made tons of money with the usual insider trading on weapons stocks. Another nice fat $$$ transfer from the taxpayers.

1803 2018-04-14 14:40:53 There’s no chemical weapons stocks. They don’t exist
1804 2018-04-14 14:40:41 The attack probably provided a defence to more civilian children being petrified through gassing with chlorine and sarin stocks.  But if you think that isn't a laudable aim, and would rather play politics....... Maybe we should reason with Assad ?

No need of bump stocks, high cap mags or assault-style weapons; no sensible reason to deny 21 y/o age & 30-day bg check.
1818 2018-04-14 14:31:13 A few #marijuana stocks look like they could breakout, but the rest just look like shorting opportunities.
1819 2018-04-14 14:30:31 Even if you do not believe in technical analysis, there's still value in being able to identify areas in which other technical traders are watching. Especially as more traders come over from the stock market.

1829 2018-04-14 14:25:31 Hold it over time and watch it devalue as a result of inflation. Even a high interest bank account doesn't cover inflation.

1833 2018-04-14 14:22:13 Stocks are hard to understand
1834 2018-04-14 14:22:07 It's always reassuring to know that generous stocks of eye shadow will survive the apocalypse.
1835 2018-04-14 14:21:47 No. I would recommend for now dont go for options trading. Options trading is advisable only when the trend is very strong. First learn trading stocks. Be strong in that. Then next everything will follow.
1836 2018-04-14 14:20:44 Absolutely. But it's been said, Zuckerberg sold a lot of his stocks & then paid off 85% of the members in the committee by donating to their campaigns. Then they all gave him softball questions. I don't know who in particular didn't accept 85% is all but 2 or 3 of them

1852 2018-04-14 14:07:11 “The main reason why money is lost in stocks is not because Wall Street is dishonest, but because so many people persist in thinking that you can make money without working for it and that the stock exchange is the place where this miracle can be performed” Jessie Livermore

1876 2018-04-14 13:52:46 No you wake up, jobs are up, economy is growing, stocks market are up, taxes cut, businesses are coming back, trade deals are being redone in American favor, ISIS is gone, and the world is put on notice. America is back bigger and stronger than ever before.

1883 2018-04-14 13:46:10 Some stocks trade on theory, these are stocks which will have huge swings when traders switch their focus to fundamentals.
1884 2018-04-14 13:44:34 I'm worried for my parents (And everyone else that has all their retirement savings in stocks). When all the news comes out, do you fear a market panic/crash?
1885 2018-04-14 13:42:18 You're convinced it was Assad.  It's between proven IS and rebels both had stocks.

Assad has the war won. Any would he employ chemical weapons knowing the probable backlash?

Who stands to benefit from this?

This is a crock - and you should know it . . . Perhaps you do
1886 2018-04-14 13:41:28 No need to deter him from using CW's as the OPCW has verified all stocks were destroyed in 2014. Before swallowing the media lies ask what possible motive he had to do it. Why risk all the sacrifices of the last 8 years to gas a few civilians.  Doesn't make sense.
1887 2018-04-14 13:41:16 Might just save some lives if they hit the mustard gas stocks.

1888 2018-04-14 13:41:14 Stop. Nothing. They were talking about banning bump stocks since Vegas. It never happened. Unlike every other country in the world, we normally expand access to guns after gun massacres instead of restricting them.
1889 2018-04-14 13:40:48 Another bombshell on #Trump collusion.  LOL  The only bombshells these days are (hopefully) falling on the Syrian army & chemical stocks. #Syria #SyriaStrikes

1902 2018-04-14 13:20:51 Bitcoin has potential to revolutionize how we use currency (removing central banking) but it was ignored because we were told it can pop at any point so the consumers (us) sold stocks crippling bitcoin.

1903 2018-04-14 13:20:15 Yes you're right Mike - would be very interesting to see impact of 2008 - I think for most of those Stocks the Divvys kept coming but #HSBA got hammered. I think it was data issue that led him to just 10 years.
1904 2018-04-14 13:18:10 yeah the banks got hit alright.. many markets/stocks globally all have lower highs too.. just not a great look all round..

1909 2018-04-14 13:15:51 Bombarder en #Syrie des installations servant à la fabrication d'armes chimiques et des stocks d'armes chimiques, c'est terrible comme idée.

1910 2018-04-14 13:15:34 He is a liar & conman. Tax scam $ went to top 1% & used to buy back stock. Corps are still laying off, closing stores, downsizing. Where r jobs? Debt & deficit explodes & combined w/tariffs, economic farce cannot be sustained. Stocks will dive. How many ppl has he fired? Dictator

1914 2018-04-14 13:09:08 Qui s'était porté garant devant la communauté internationale, et donc devant le CSNU, de la destruction des stocks d'armes chimiques du régime Syrien et, subséquemment, que plus jamais après la Goutha 2013 elles ne seraient employées ?
Et ce contre l'absence de représailles ?

1920 2018-04-14 13:07:10 The PM didn't need to come before Parliament. For most of our history military decisions have been an executive decision. Delays could have caused weapon stocks to be moved. On balance looks like an OK decision.

1922 2018-04-14 13:04:18 the only consistency I see is war for natural resources. war in Iraq was to secure the oil fields to stop Saddam selling his oil stocks in Euros not Dollars.
and this one I believe is about securing a competing gas pipeline against one coming from Russia running through Syria.
1923 2018-04-14 13:04:11 Dropping some more missiles in the desert and then beating your chest at how brave you are is akin to banning bump stocks. Does nothing. Changes nothing. Proves nothing.

1925 2018-04-14 13:02:52 FWIW - It is interesting that the narrative around this week's rise in Treasury bond yields all ties to rotation (of bond dollars into stocks) rather than inflation.

1939 2018-04-14 12:47:40 It is not reckless in this context. This is targeting chemical weapons facilities, that have been banned since after World War 1. These countries can't control their stocks, and the black market means danger to UK citizens, especially in light of recent events, although different
1940 2018-04-14 12:47:17 True , many stocks had down more than that in my PF before and now all are stand tall on havk of nos. Overall its good to know so many suggestions and views and i am happy to see retaios investors are now more educated and informed .
1941 2018-04-14 12:46:30 Please release your taxes so we know you don’t own a bunch of defense stocks and therefore stand to personally enrich yourself by increasing defense spending. #AlerttheDaycareStaff #DementedDonnie
1942 2018-04-14 12:45:42 Chemical weapons are against international law since post World War 1. Seeing as Third World countries like Syria cannot control their stocks, and indeed produce them at all, means there is direct risk to UK public from easy proliferation on the black market.

1953 2018-04-14 12:39:32 I am real close to unfollowing you and infowars, though I know you couldn’t care less. But this was not an aggressive strike. It was specific. Chemical stocks are bad for entire world.

1955 2018-04-14 12:38:28 I guess that's been part of it but I think the continual flow of Dividends is a big help. My mate did some simplistic backtesting on my 12 Income Stocks over last 10 years and the Return was 8% CAGR.

1958 2018-04-14 12:36:08 Pour ma part, il m'arrive très très rarement d'être d'accord avec Macron, mais jamais avec Mélenchon !

1959 2018-04-14 12:34:03 Defense related stocks will no doubt be soaring when the markets open on Monday. The neocons are giddy at the feel good strike. Meanwhile the US continues to “surgically” drone murder in Afghanistan Pakistan Iraq Somalia Niger Lybia Syria Yemen. Did I leave anyone out

1972 2018-04-14 12:27:46 @SenBobCorker And most of the billions is going to stock buy backs, won't grow the economy. Worst policy ever! You can still propose real pro growth reform by leaving low tax rates on profits shared with workers and raise taxes substantially on profits used to buy back stocks.

1978 2018-04-14 12:23:36 Yes. Successful. Deal an evil leader a military defeat and give another bump to my defense stocks.  Win-win.
1979 2018-04-14 12:23:33 I'm from Newfoundland. We have a lot of indigenous ppl that do this as part of their heritage. Also seal meat is a huge thing here. I would say 60% of the islanders here eat it (all races and religions). Also the seals have been diminishing our cod stocks and causing a problem!
1980 2018-04-14 12:21:47 mais ,s'ils ont détruit les stocks d'armes chimiques,les civils aux alentours ont dû être contaminés, a votre avis?
1981 2018-04-14 12:21:40 It’s investing, it happens and it’s in the OTC.  It’s like the old west of stocks, it’s not illegal.  I’m down 42k on Andi right now but she’s a long play.  The teams there let them do their jobs.  Badgering people on their twitter accounts isn’t the way to make the stock move.
1982 2018-04-14 12:21:27 J'ai entendu que les cibles étaient des centres de R&D et des usines de production ... pas exactement des stocks de produits finis ...
1983 2018-04-14 12:19:46 Jacob, what stocks/shares would you recommend we invest in to take advantage of the excellent opportunities arising from bombing Syria ?
1984 2018-04-14 12:19:03 I am also very serious about bank earnings as the stocks get slammed
1985 2018-04-14 12:16:00 Bakit po ang baba ng stocks niyo ngayon?
1986 2018-04-14 12:15:38 Kind of amazing how fast Conte and this group of players have turned from champions to laughing stocks.
1987 2018-04-14 12:15:02 Slip of the tongue. See who he is dreaming of
1988 2018-04-14 12:14:45 Question con: des armes ou des gaz chimiques c'est volatile... Donc en bombardant les stocks rien ne s'est échappé? Tout a cramé ?
1989 2018-04-14 12:13:50 The religion of the country doesn’t matter. A dictator killed his own ppl.
1990 2018-04-14 12:13:21 Appreciate both the kind words and that you spotted it! Will let them know now.
1991 2018-04-14 12:12:53 Decent stocks pal
1992 2018-04-14 12:12:22 Il a dit aussi : l’analyse PERMETTERA de déterminer l’origine du gaz : donc ils nous aucune preuves et pourquoi frapper la veille de l’arrivée de l’OIAC?? Histoire de répandre réellement des gaz après l’explosion des stocks???
1993 2018-04-14 12:10:46 Absolutely no worries
1994 2018-04-14 12:10:24 Dites @EmmanuelMacron c’est pas dangereux de bombarder des stocks d’armes chimiques ? Il doit y avoir pleins de victimes collatérales non ? Où bien était-ce juste pour détruire l’endroit où les inspecteurs devaient enquêter ? Merci pour votre réponse.

1997 2018-04-14 12:05:40 No nos engañemos. El ataque a Siria, sin amparo de las Naciones Unidas, es fruto de la presión de la industria del armamento para aligerar los stocks; para eso han puesto a Trump de presidente de los EEUU.

2000 2018-04-14 12:04:14 Missile manufactures their stocks on Wall Street are up there should be protests at the stock market as well the profit from war and spread propaganda around the world
2001 2018-04-14 12:04:08 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
2002 2018-04-14 12:02:25 omg this is so true i mean the store where i buy merch its the same situation as this because sometimes the thing is why they just say they don’t have it its because they don’t know them even tho they have stocks-.-
2003 2018-04-14 12:01:24 Dupont Aignant qui dit sur franceinfo qu’on aurait mieux fait de demander à Assad de détruire ses stocks de gaz... mais il était de quelle planète en 2013 le Dupont?!
2004 2018-04-14 12:00:08 Il n’y a pas de risque de contaminer la population alentours en détruisant les stocks ? Et je suppose que maintenant si des armes #chimiques sont utilisées #BacharElAssad pourra dire que ce n’en est pas vu que « tout a été détruit ». #Syrie
2005 2018-04-14 11:59:14 You are expecting 100% profits YOY. Its better to add upto some level of your portfolio. I know other stocks in the portfolio too would be good it might not make sense to sell them since the story is not yet played out. I will only sell others if it overvalued
2006 2018-04-14 11:58:11 You talk stocks as well? Nice! $MOO
2007 2018-04-14 11:57:25 Les russes incriminent Theresa May, les alliés Trump et Macron aident les anglais à détruire des "stocks" de quoi ? de qui ? on ne saura pas leur origine mais eux diront qu'ils ont bien rempli leur mission de détruire les armes chimiques du vilain Assad !
Qui s'est ridiculisé ??
2008 2018-04-14 11:56:27 Alors que Poutine s'était engagé en 2013/ONU, à l'élimination d'armes chimiques en Syrie, voilà qu'il proteste de la destruction de ces armes et stocks, qui ne devraient plus exister! Vu qu'il oppose son veto à l'ONU, il a bonne mine d'y faire appel.
2009 2018-04-14 11:55:23 quand on bombarde des stocks et des arsenaux d’armes chimiques, quel est le résultat ? Les armes chimiques disparaissent ou se répandent dans la nature ? Vraiment les US, l'UK et la FR n'ont pas vraiment à se mêler pr moi
2010 2018-04-14 11:55:22 Yeah well good luck reducing their ability to reconstitute chlorine stocks.
2011 2018-04-14 11:52:01 If I can help David, you obliterate the chemical weapon stocks, then kids don’t get gassed anymore. You can agree or disagree but that is the case. Btw, I also fully support Dubs, the two are not mutually exclusive.
2012 2018-04-14 11:50:27 Sir we Can't buy stocks before you buy 
2013 2018-04-14 11:50:01 @NissanPHI It's a nice promo (that you have there for the Navara), but it's too bad that your promo period is running out faster than you can replenish your stocks. None of your dealers have it in store. 
2014 2018-04-14 11:47:00 Mr Macron,si les stocks chimiques ont étés touchés, on devra s'attendre à une hécatombes,comme à Bhopal,....pourtant.....rien à l'horizon. Allo Mr Powell....allô...
2015 2018-04-14 11:45:16 How are your stocks of bread?

2021 2018-04-14 11:40:08 Oui bien sûr... Déjà en 1991 c'est l'armée US qui avait ouvert les corridors pour permettre à Hussein de gazer Bassorah. Ou les forces spéciales qui bloquaient les stocks d'armes que voulaient les populations chiites pour se défendre...

2023 2018-04-14 11:38:28 Might be a good a idea to ring ahead to @woolworths and check on their #vegan cheese stocks to avoid disappointment
2024 2018-04-14 11:38:14 Be positive in a bear market your favorite stocks are on sale and you can begin accumulating.
2025 2018-04-14 11:36:47 Donc pour le Drian, les armes chimiques etait dans les stocks d'assad.
Dans un tel cas, elles n'étaient donc pas utilisées

2042 2018-04-14 11:17:04 Nope. I don't. But I have invested in healthcare stocks & have made a ton. Once weed really goes mainstream, I expect to make even more in healthcare investments!
2043 2018-04-14 11:15:07 For the first time I heard for mr. RJ in a conference tht market will fall but RJ will be the one who will buy the stocks in deep...never heard from RJ equity will fall...words have there own importance

2045 2018-04-14 11:13:39 Lol its bullshit. The rats want their war stocks to rise. The rats say "jump" and May jumps. Who needs evidence when you have such obedient puppets?
2046 2018-04-14 11:13:16 To destroy evidence of course!

2048 2018-04-14 11:11:39 Le précédent de 2014 pour les mêmes raisons avait été une « erreur » car l’enquête qui a suivie a prouvé l’utilisation des armes chimiques par les islamistes qui avaient pillé des stocks syriens. La vraie raison n’est pas là mais dans les accords passés avec les chiites !
2049 2018-04-14 11:09:51 The government have stocks and shares within the arms industry, so when the fund wars, taxpayers money basically goes into their own pockets

2053 2018-04-14 11:02:57 What other public reaction would one expect? Perhaps a confession from Assad & a promise, cross his heart, to not do it again! Or maybe a letter of resignation! Oh, & an explanation from Russia as to how it missed these stocks of chem weapons when they ‘removed’ all of them!

2055 2018-04-14 11:02:33 Pour l'instant, rien de grave, la coalition Franco-UK-USA s'est contenté de bombarder des stocks d'armes chimiques de ASSAD, sans attaquer personne d'autre, ni Russe, ni autre.
Il n'est pas certain que cela mène à l'escalade.

2063 2018-04-14 10:56:55 No. tokenism was believing Putin and his vassal Assad when they said that not taking action in 2013 would result in Syria destroying its CW stocks. That negligence allowed Assad/Putin/Iran to kill another >400k people. Many with CW.

2065 2018-04-14 10:54:40 The big losers in the #SyriaStrikes are ‘smart’ missile manufacturers who have demonstrated that 70% of their best tech cannot breach an ageing air defence system. What hope would they have against the best of Russia air defence, none. Their stocks should plummet on Monday.
2066 2018-04-14 10:54:38 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U. S. national debts & public stocks owned by Chinese government, enterprises and oligarchs, (2) kick ALL the Chinese banks out of the SWIFT system, (3) change the regime in Beijing.

2070 2018-04-14 10:48:33 One has to be too lucky to do so..need lot of conviction, patience and luck. Of course selection of stocks is the key too..
2071 2018-04-14 10:46:17 RT Wealth_Park "On this note, I know a few people who have converted 10 lakhs to 10 crores in 10 years by investing in stocks (without trading in derivatives). Of course, this is not repeatable & can't be learnt or taught!"
2072 2018-04-14 10:46:02 I'm keeping calm. I'm not in favour of "getting involved" in Syria but if chemical plant, stocks and delivery means can be denied without king matters much worse, I might be reassured. The damage assessment later today will be important.

2076 2018-04-14 10:42:16 The article was the FUD. I’ve been reading about Tesla’s demise for 8 years. The burn rate is real but as long as the cash is coming in from banks and stocks they’ll be fine. They’re expanding like crazy...they have to.

2081 2018-04-14 10:35:00 Wasn’t the latest attack Chlorine? I doubt that is categorised as a chemical weapon due to civil use. Also, certifying destruction of stocks doesn’t prevent future manufacture.

2086 2018-04-14 10:31:20 America had spent upwards 7 billion in 6 years worth of weapons and supplies, sent her own stocks of ATGM, propped up over 270 different groups to fight Assad. In comparison to the Contra or the KR. The scale of this op is un-matched.

2091 2018-04-14 10:25:50 @CocaCola @CocaColaCo  why are the new flavours not in decaf bottles  in uk also ? And why are stocks of decaf coca cola so low here too?
2092 2018-04-14 10:25:03 Nifty Equal Weight can not be compared with Next 50. Both has totally different stocks and different methodologies. In any equal weight index, weights of top is shifted to tail i.e. allocation to little bit more risk but still less risky as compared to next 50 stocks.
2093 2018-04-14 10:25:01 How will it? Bombing stocks of chemicals would surely release them into the atmosphere, if they exist. If, on the other hand they haven’t been destroyed, if they exist WTF was the point? Seriously.

2103 2018-04-14 10:16:55 Une question au président !
C’est quoi une arme chimique ?
N’est-ce pas du gaz? Et lorsque vous bombardez des stocks de gaz, l’échappement de ce gaz ne contaminera ni animal ni humain ? Quelle est l’enveloppe de protection environnementale ? Ou bien on s’en fou des conséquences !
2104 2018-04-14 10:14:31 He could certainly move delivery mechanisms, but harder with production, stocks or supply routes.
2105 2018-04-14 10:13:50 So my family was discussing tax stuff over tea and I got told "ignore this you won't understand haha" while lowkey I trade stocks for a living and like calculate taxes for fun daily and I replied "yeah i study computers this ain't my dept maa where's the good cookies at?" 
2106 2018-04-14 10:13:29 Google, Facebook, Tesla etc... have incentives (salaries, stocks) to improve their products. Yet, people create alternatives & incentivize other to join them. Same with crypto. Moreover the btc fork showed that regarless of any incentive, people disagree on the roadmap.

2111 2018-04-14 10:07:34 Stocks is a scam dump based instrument. Not designed to be bought. But Fx not like that. Both long side and short side have equal force... hence profits highly guaranteed as long as you don’t jump the gun with entries.
2112 2018-04-14 10:06:17 toutefois, les russes n'ont las mentionné quelle version du S-300 (qui n'est plus produit) est ce celle des stocks russes comme fute cas des t-90A et les T-72B3 ou le S-350 ANTEY :
2113 2018-04-14 10:06:16 And the catch is how is the broader market doing. People think the same rules apply to all market conditions and that's where I think u can have an edge. In a T 20 u don't play test cricket, so in a market when other stocks are zooming do not add more a stock that's falling
2114 2018-04-14 10:04:53 A sunny day @Broadway_Mkt with fresh stocks of delicious #vietnamesecoffee in #saigonstreetcafe and our special #icedcoffee to cool you down.
2115 2018-04-14 10:03:30 Option 5, but with a catch. Key learning for me in one such stock was for PF to perform I should not add if a stock is down more than 30% . No one knows how long it will stay that way and in a market where other stocks are flying u should not block additional capital.
2116 2018-04-14 10:02:56 Ha ha love that it comes back to stocks!

2122 2018-04-14 09:59:28 @WWF You are making a complete mess of Elephant conservation. Ivory that is confiscated should be sold to create a glut and so depress the price. Destroying stocks keeps the price up and plays into the hands of the poachers. Get real!
2123 2018-04-14 09:58:34 More important to ask a) how much of chemical warfare arsenal did Assad during the 2014 amnesty - was this under-declared? b) Did the US, UK & France attack facilities in process of production or existing stocks? c) what analysis did military strategists do beforehand on seepage?

2126 2018-04-14 09:54:47 Trading Rules for Successful trader
5. Trade in 2 to 4 Stocks at a time with strict Stop Loss.

and keep a strict vigil to avoid any misfortune in case of any eventuality.
2127 2018-04-14 09:54:19 Smart and Successful trader would trade in 2 to 4 stocks with strict Stop Loss
2128 2018-04-14 09:53:44 and try to make profit in all the 20 stocks just because all are moving up or vice versa in a Down trend?
2129 2018-04-14 09:53:33 As a Trader you know this fact but can you Buy 20 Stocks
2130 2018-04-14 09:53:20 5. Trade in 2 to 4 Stocks at a time with strict Stop Loss.
In a Bull move, most of the stocks move up and similarly in any Bear Move, most of the stock moves southwards.
2131 2018-04-14 09:53:18 Type 26 will have strike length VLS when in service some time in mid-2020s. More to the point will MoD buy appropriate TLAM stocks to fill them
2132 2018-04-14 09:52:18 Absolutely horrid. No on researches if it was a false flag or not. War rats wants profit from their war stocks again.
2133 2018-04-14 09:52:13 Successful trader would concentrate on the movement of those stocks only
2134 2018-04-14 09:51:43 and remain focused on the movement of those stocks only.
2135 2018-04-14 09:51:41 #GOLD On response to Syrian missile strikes, gold price shot to US$1344 while markets were open. No mistake - Monday will see US$1370 and gold stocks will all break out. Markets will be in turmoil. Scarey week ahead - we are back to Cold War days but worse.
2136 2018-04-14 09:51:01 In low volume stocks the spread is too high and chance of Stop Loss limit getting failed is too
2137 2018-04-14 09:50:36 Always rely upon Stocks which have reasonably high volume over a period of time.
2138 2018-04-14 09:50:27 2. Trade ONLY in active & high Volume Stocks/ Futures.
Many Traders get stuck with stocks for want of liquidity.

Dans ce cas, pourquoi ne pas les avoir bombardés dès le départ au lieu d'attendre que Bachar les utilises !?

2145 2018-04-14 09:40:54 Yes, the more time the Syrians have to disperse their chem weapon stocks & equipment the better..
2146 2018-04-14 09:39:48 @Peston So, if US and UK knew of these chemical stocks, why leave the bombing until now?  Why no big fuss about them to the UN last year?  Would not those be sensible questions?
2147 2018-04-14 09:38:26 I don't think an investigation was possible. We already know where the chem warfare stocks are, we just waited until after they were used. Why now?
2148 2018-04-14 09:38:06 C’est ça ils ont bombardé ces stocks QUE BACHAR ALLAIT UTILISER CONTRE LES SYRIENS je pense c’est un « bon début » d’agissement contre cette pourriture
2149 2018-04-14 09:37:15 Oui voila la ils ont bombardé des stocks chimiques mais il faut arrêter le dictateur ptn

2154 2018-04-14 09:32:45 Thanks Brian.  Your article cites inconsistencies, but what evidence that we 'know' the declaration deliberately incomplete? Also, if US UK suspect CW stocks at these sites, why not require OPCW inspection? Lastly, if Assad trying to hide his CW, why publicly use it against kids?

2159 2018-04-14 09:27:35 The OPCW need to compare chemicals found in Douma with those in Syria's CW plants. How can they do that, now that the CW plants and their chemical stocks have been destroyed?
2160 2018-04-14 09:24:03 @_chrissails Types Of Investments I Would Recommend For A Beginner Include:

- Common Stocks(Preferably With DRIPs - Dividend Reinvestment Programs)
- Mutual Funds
- REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
- U.S. Treasury Securities
- Index Funds
- IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)
2161 2018-04-14 09:23:30 No, no, no - at a recent workshop on black skies resilience, someone I know noted how you need plenty of food, water and fuel for a generator, plus stocks of gin and cannabis plants

2163 2018-04-14 09:21:16 My preference, as I often tweet, is for the reintroduction of Public Stocks, situated right outside the House of Commons!
2164 2018-04-14 09:19:38 i'm trying to learn how to pitch stocks in 5 days
2165 2018-04-14 09:18:00 Okay  
Let me know if you need anything. Ive got stocks of most things.
2166 2018-04-14 09:17:54 i did but you cleaned up stocks super well when i went off stage for dumb reasons and just in neutral you made me work so hard to get in. ggs
2167 2018-04-14 09:17:47 @hoaxeye first of all you probably won't consider this a scientific classification however I thought I would point it out anyway. The stocks that were done by UFO were woven and not crushed as the pranksters can only do. Secondly dead insects were found stuck to the stems
2168 2018-04-14 09:16:14 Travis, lives on Osterman Drive with lots of kids.

2171 2018-04-14 09:12:47 I too am so excited for @partypoker right now!  They have the largest Ceiling as 888 has pretty much peaked, and everyone in the USA is waiting for Party as they are STD Free in every State!  I'm in Pennsylvania, hoping for Party in a few months! I'd invest in Party Stocks 100%.
2172 2018-04-14 09:11:08 Was also shocked with the performance on Friday compared to other gold stocks total bummer
2173 2018-04-14 09:11:06 More great numbers on Stocks and the WH today!
2174 2018-04-14 09:10:07 No, we just bombed Syrian government manufacturing facilities because they lied about destroying their chemical weapons stocks and ignored the international convention that they should not be used.
2175 2018-04-14 09:09:03 There needs to be a global uniting of our worlds food and farm stocks to ensure peaceful trade between China (Rice)

2176 2018-04-14 09:06:59 #Syrie Détruire des stocks et lieux de prod supposés d'armes chimique, OK. Mais pas en totale illégalité au regard du droit international et hors cadre #ONU.
@Villepin et #chirac me manque.
2177 2018-04-14 09:06:49 Frappes ciblées en représailles ou pour détruire des stocks chimiques soit. Escalade de la violence, de nouvelles frappes moins ciblées ou ratées, victimes par milliers, femmes et enfants... innocents pris entre 2 feux, toujours les mêmes, mais de différents bourreaux... #Syrie
2178 2018-04-14 09:06:11 Not to mention obtaining more stocks of CWs for false flag events.
2179 2018-04-14 09:05:18 Demand for barrels of oil is gonna go through the roof so may as well invest in stocks and shares
2180 2018-04-14 09:04:36 Who knows.  But their stocks of chemicals are at least depleted somewhat should they choose to do more unfathomable and unconscionable things.
2181 2018-04-14 09:04:13 @iamkarendavila pki tanong sa NFA kun bakit umabot ng 2017 ang stocks pa nung 2015 tpos ibebenta na lang nila lhat sa mas mbabang presyo na ikalulugi ng gobyerno pro yun negosyanteng nakabili e ibebenta rin sa prevailing price.khit saan mo tignan talo ang gobyerno at end consumer

2185 2018-04-14 09:01:10 Et Moscou a trahi son engagement de 2013 de neutraliser les stocks syriens.
2186 2018-04-14 08:59:41 Theresa May is not correct to say no other group could have carried out the chemical attack in Syria. The US keeps huge stocks of chemical weapons and had the motive for using them in Syria, unlike the Syrians or the Russians,

2189 2018-04-14 08:57:35 Managed to more or less clear my stocks of coffee. Just in time to visit the @LdnCoffeeFest tomorrow!
2190 2018-04-14 08:56:14 Either that or just taking turns blowing their loads so they can tax us for more military and bring the weapons stocks higher.
2191 2018-04-14 08:56:06 Siria es otro ejemplo más de como la maquinaria del matar tiene que buscar salida a sus stocks con excusas baratas de falta de libertad, saltandose  a organismos mundiales,ignorando resoluciones, escuchando a un terrorista que gobierna EEUU #NoALaGuerra
2192 2018-04-14 08:54:59 Faut bien justifier les achats d armes, ecouler les vieux stocks ... pour en racheter d autres ! Par contre le fait que la population locale developpera 100x de cancers que le reste de l humanite dans 10-15 ans rien a f*** ! (Cf Serbie)

2194 2018-04-14 08:54:01 Either way we will have to disagree on who to blame about Parkland, I would blame direct respondents rather than indirect policy makers, especially when not even the ATF has the ability to ban bump stocks or AR-15s legally, if you want to know why I'll write about that later.
2195 2018-04-14 08:53:54 You mean in this action? Not really, because I don't care. It's not war, it's theater, the outrage from last year 2.0

You mean if anything? Oh yeah. Bump stocks. The god awful omnibus spending bill. Shit I can't even remember. But... good outweighs the bad. By leaps and bounds.
2196 2018-04-14 08:51:22 Bombing chemical stocks is a great idea... releases them into the environment uncontrollably and could possibly poison civilians. 
2197 2018-04-14 08:50:47 I'll be honest with you the wealthy are doing very well which means small business owners like myself are doing very well. I work for the wealthy I don't work for illegal immigrants and I don't work for the poor. I don't feel I was suckered stocks are doing great,
2198 2018-04-14 08:50:28 Celebrating the destruction of their government's CW stocks, allowing them the freedom to go about their normal lives ...
2199 2018-04-14 08:47:30 His stocks were depleted this week @danj87
2200 2018-04-14 08:45:28 They haven't a clue what they have bombed.these so called chemical weapons stocks will be we'll protected from air strikes.if there was any to start with?
2201 2018-04-14 08:45:01 Perhaps gold stocks will go up

2204 2018-04-14 08:37:34 Doit on s’attendre à des frappes russes et chinoises contre nos stocks d’armes en France ? A quoi sert l’ONU ?
2205 2018-04-14 08:37:07 Yep yep. She said you need to like sign up (?) and order then the stocks will arrive a week later.

@weareoneEXO #PremiosMTVMiaw #MTVBRKPOPEXO
2206 2018-04-14 08:37:07 Have Britain. France & The USA destroyed their stocks of chemical weapons, or are they still in the bunkers?
2207 2018-04-14 08:36:06 Their may or may not be the justification of attack on Syria 
World would like to know the justification of  largest stocks maintained by @POTUS & allies countries @theresa_may @France24_en
2208 2018-04-14 08:35:16 I bet BAE shares boom on Monday.

Nothing like bombing the Middle East to bump up those stocks!

2209 2018-04-14 08:34:56 If he had read the OPCW last annual report he would have noted that the US aren’t planning to start the last phase of the destruction of their own stocks until 2020 and not to complete until 2023
2210 2018-04-14 08:33:42 For retail investors, actively recommend buying equal weighted large cap stocks for starters. And rebalance once every year. You must not be concerned with the investable set if you are going to be one nano percent of that investable set.
2211 2018-04-14 08:32:50 Mon avis sur la Syrie, faut passer les stocks de bombe disponible
2212 2018-04-14 08:31:47 So why has the United States not yet destroyed all of their chemical weapon stocks?

2217 2018-04-14 08:27:51 Où est-ce que tu as vu que l’on cherchait à destituer Assad directement ? Nos frappes se sont cantonnées aux stocks et aux labos de fabrication d’armes chimiques, c’est la ligne directrice de ces opérations. RàV avec l’Irak ou la Libye. Le Mali au contraire se porte bien mieux.
2218 2018-04-14 08:27:47 They targeted chemical stocks.. what's wrong with you @luvbela?
2219 2018-04-14 08:27:13 It’s also obviously a lie since if there where stocks of chemical weapons and ‘we’ bombed them it would follow that there would be masssive civilian casualties?
2220 2018-04-14 08:26:50 Je me souviens lorsqu'on accusait Daech d utiliser le gaz moutarde

Comme si ce gaz avait été fabriqué par Daech !
Pourtant France, Italie  US  Russie Japon... ont des stocks encore aujourd'hui de ce gaz moutarde.

Alors question : 
Qui est le fournisseur officiel de Daech !
2221 2018-04-14 08:25:55 Thanks mate. I remember chatting to you back in 2016 about silver miners and their wasn't much around in terms of ASX listed stocks. I assume that's still the case?
2222 2018-04-14 08:25:33 The aims of the strike are limited. To degrade stocks of chemical weapons and prevent future use. Do you disagree with this aim?
2223 2018-04-14 08:25:31 En 40 il paraît qu il n'y avait aucunes preuves que des trains remplis d'hommes de femmes et d'enfants allaient être gazés. On le reproche encore à nos anciens et vous voulez recommencer. Ils n'ont touchés que les stocks d'armes chimiques donc principe de précaution.
2224 2018-04-14 08:24:55 The enormous stocks of unused disastrous nuclear weapon to have been displayed yet as token of arrogance and complex of super powers waiting to counter & be encountered by rival Nations have come out in full swing from constrained webs of their unwanted compulsion to have been.
2225 2018-04-14 08:23:59 Dow will climb up ..

2226 2018-04-14 08:23:51 Totalement d'accord avec vous. Mais n'était ce pas le cas là ? (de bombarder des stocks de munitions chimiques)

2232 2018-04-14 08:20:20 qd des armes chimiques disparaissent on peut s'en réjouir, après les usa disposent eux aussi encore de stocks d'armes chimiques & si on est à peu près sûrs qu'ils ne l'utilisent pas sur leur propre population on ne sait pas si ils ne l'utilisent pas ailleurs @EmmanuelMacron
2233 2018-04-14 08:20:14 More important will be to see how do they manage the buffer stocks before it is spoiled

2241 2018-04-14 08:12:00 Je suis d’accord avec toi, ça ne changera pas son comportement.

2251 2018-04-14 08:08:32 People do tend to exit their long term investment in some stocks due to lack of patience. Some stocks will never give you return for 2--3 yrs but would give you multiple in the next 2-3 yrs. #Venkeys we exited 50% around 550 range. Holding balance now !!! Being content now.. 
2252 2018-04-14 08:08:19 Good point but bump stocks are a joke if you’ve ever used one. Terribly inefficient.
2253 2018-04-14 08:08:10 ces frappes ont été menées en collaboration avec les Russes personne n'est dupe, et les stocks d'armes qui ont été visés ont été vidés depuis plusieurs jours, et la télé syrienne ne parle pas de morts. Pas de quoi en faire un plat
2254 2018-04-14 08:05:54 Chemical weapons capability was non existent. OPCW confirmed stocks destroyed years ago or had you forgot?
2255 2018-04-14 08:05:48 Hey .@ForbiddenPlanet I really hope you have some over stocks of the signed #doctorwho books from last night as I had an inconsolable 9 year old daughter that I had to lead out of the line after queueing for two hours (we had a train to catch) :-(

2259 2018-04-14 08:03:20 Just like they banned bump stocks, but can still bump fire guns
2260 2018-04-14 08:03:03 The very crowd Trump is trying to appease will stab him in the back. Now begins the clamoring for Contracts in Syria. Stocks in military contractors now a good Buy position.

2262 2018-04-14 08:01:45 Next to repeating 18y old experiments faithfully using 18y old yeast stocks, I like this bit: "original X-rays were thrown away when I moved into new flat with little storage place about 4 y ago"
PhD students rarely take original data records home, leave corresponding author w/o
2263 2018-04-14 08:00:43 Concerns about Teresa May getting parliamentary approval are right. But, Asad is using chemical weapons against innocent civilians. Swift action was required. Discussing it in parliament just gives him time to move his weapon stocks.

2276 2018-04-14 07:51:06 Though they are taught to think of stocks as companies, they are ultimately trading stocks (though over years). So others' emotions count. When that is counted, losing money becomes a focus, not earning.

2283 2018-04-14 07:41:12 Inspectors were checking these places today. Perhaps Trump & Co doubted there were any stocks of chemicals. Can't trust either side.

2289 2018-04-14 07:34:27 That statistic, that 64% or directly held international stocks are tech stocks, alone should blow a whole in any argument about good portfolio design and shows a lack of diversification and “flavour of the day” investing. I believe tech very important but diversification more so.
2290 2018-04-14 07:33:35 Sirjee Middle class, Poors, and honest riches doesn't have any problem with Aadhar because we don't have anything to hide like fake accounts, stocks, gold, commodity. But I think many congress politician have all these so they have objection on Aadhar. Black money get revealed.
2291 2018-04-14 07:32:58 #r4today it appears that the stocks of chemical weapons were not touched, perhaps, for obvious reasons.
2292 2018-04-14 07:32:48 Can expect a slight correction in #stockmakets in next 10 days...to account for the present 6 day rally...nothing to worry for long term investors...just hold on to the #quality stocks...expecting a 2 -2.5% drop in the existing portfolio...will top up current holdings!
2293 2018-04-14 07:32:35 But the Russian tv told to fill the stocks with rice and noodles in preparation for WW3. That’s disappointing
2294 2018-04-14 07:31:55 What to do if stock is trading 55% below  buy price?
1. Sell at loss & add on which are in profit 
2. Sell other stocks which are at profit & average this
3. Wait for next result and than take a call
4.wait for some cash flow and average it
5. If it's high conviction -DO NOTHING
2295 2018-04-14 07:31:38 The Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons & the USA oversaw the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons (CWs) stocks and facilities in 2014.

The USA, UK and France all have a significant range & quantities of CWs. They have used CWs on their own and other people.
2296 2018-04-14 07:31:08 Cette nuit, @EmmanuelMacron avec ses potes gaucho @realDonaldTrump et @TheresaMayPM a frappé des stocks et fes lieux fe production d armes chimiques.

2304 2018-04-14 07:20:58 My own conclusion is that a cold war with russia or even china is a real possibility now. What this means for stocks is anyones guess. Record dept levels, printing and very low rates is a unicorn situation. So be alert and watch your equity exposure.

2331 2018-04-14 07:01:04 Incorrect. Today's actions are the desperate thrashing of the snake after its demonic attempt to topple the Syrian Govt using Islamist terrorists has been thwarted. Any news on when you folks are going to destroy your chemical weapons stocks? The biggest in the world, I believe?
2332 2018-04-14 07:00:49 I don’t think Russia, herself has been impuned on the gas attacks. She should have carried through her original plan to destroy chemical weapon stocks.

2349 2018-04-14 06:45:12 I agree if you have proof and believe Syria will take note. but we should all press the USA to destroy its own stocks. Currently according to the OPCWS they plan to start in 2020 and not complete until 2023

2352 2018-04-14 06:43:59 It is strange that cash is outperforming stocks & bonds in short term as other asset's return is obtained adding risk premium to risk free asset. Though in long term cash is not risk free.

2357 2018-04-14 06:39:04 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
2358 2018-04-14 06:35:56 The PVT banks  will start reporting numbers from 19 April onwards. First is INDUS IND bank and then on 21 st HDFC Bank . Both can rally in the begining of the week . One can watch these stocks.
2359 2018-04-14 06:35:55 Make stocks available afterwards ask us to watch. Otherwise Infinity war promo is way better.

2361 2018-04-14 06:32:51 Of COURSE they did!
2362 2018-04-14 06:32:16 For trading for the next week , one can buy RBL Bank at current level of 500 and wait for the rally upto 520 in the coming days with stop loss at 490

2364 2018-04-14 06:30:37 The problem with the NRA is they are stopping policy that the majority of the country is in favor of, i.e.  banning semi-autos, universal background checks, bump stocks, etc from passing, by paying off politicians.
2365 2018-04-14 06:30:15 Les commentateurs à la con racontent que les Russes n'ont pas osé s'opposer aux frappes, sauf que c'est #Poutine qui a permis que l'on détruise certains stocks de #Bachar dont on ne sait même pas s'ils sont chimiques. Juste pour que US, UK et FR ne perdent pas la face.

2370 2018-04-14 06:29:04 Et bien pas du tout non et c'est la même chose pour des armes chimiques. Ça fait l'effet d'une frappe et c'est tout. Il y a une grande différence entre produire des composants et produire des armes. Si la frappe avait touchées des stocks d'armes chimiques, là oui.

2372 2018-04-14 06:26:20 Among the PSU Bank stocks, BoB, Canara Bank and Indian Bank are performing better in charts and one can kindly note these stocks for trading in the coming days.
2373 2018-04-14 06:26:14 So first, I am not in favor of banning guns. I’m in favor of putting tighter restrictions (banning semi-autos, bump stocks, universal background check, raising the age requirement).

2379 2018-04-14 06:21:21 Banning high capacity magazines will do nothing the parkland shooter used 10 round mags and bump stocks are rarely used in mass shootings because they are horribly inaccurate better back ground checks might help I would be in favor of that and the AR-15 is a civilian rifle

2382 2018-04-14 06:16:47 Buy war stocks
2383 2018-04-14 06:14:36 1) point of entry into stocks is important if you are investing lumpsum.

2) Cash is king coz of liquidity and you can buy some asset that's "underpriced" if I have cash.

Finally 30 yrs really? Does someone really sit so long with cash only?
2384 2018-04-14 06:09:50 Truth: much of what we do over seas, is a waste of resources. 
Also truth: invest in war related stocks
Also truth: whiskey burn! I love it
2385 2018-04-14 06:08:19 So the missiles have been fired. This alone probably won't have any effect on markets. But we still have a long weekend before us for Putin, Xi and Mueller to make a move. But I guess is that it is all baked in by now. #stocks #SyriaCrisis
2386 2018-04-14 06:07:21 Social security is one of them. There is still 3 trillion in it most of which are in stocks. Go Google pension funds. There are many, like Calpers which is a retirement fund for California teachers. Or the civil service fund.
2387 2018-04-14 06:07:14 I wish i invested in woke stocks.
2388 2018-04-14 06:07:10 That’s pretty bad if you have to go out 30 years. Zero risk with cash. Risk with stocks.
2389 2018-04-14 06:06:50 I bet y’all ain’t know banks sold 30%+ of their stocks today! What have you really been doing with your money? Time to start investing into #BlackBanks
2390 2018-04-14 06:06:40 35. Don't be too cautious about reasons behind the moves. 
36. Trade only the active stocks.
2391 2018-04-14 06:06:01 Exactly. But these dumb a$$e$ KNOW that. They are just for gun control. Easy way in, considering that, without a bump stocks, you have 3 types of weapons. They Know that, too.
2392 2018-04-14 06:05:58 My dog says the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is a knowing stocks.
2393 2018-04-14 06:04:44 World stocks and commodities rise...
2394 2018-04-14 06:03:34 Because Russia says he is off limits, and they will see it as an attack on their ally. Of course this whole thing is staged. I believe Rupert Murdoch uses Fox News to give Trump marching orders. Need to link Murdoch to Putin other than he owns a lot of weapons stocks.
2395 2018-04-14 06:03:17 yes, we can bomb 'suspected' chemical stocks, tough on any Syrians or independent international investigators still looking for evidence who get in the way, we want assad to pack his bags but we support Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen as they don't use chemicals

2400 2018-04-14 05:58:00 Yes agreed, but stocks with Relative Strength are important for me. I don’t use indicators too.

Apologies, but one small typo I noticed: Sky will debut at Wintrust Arena against the Liberty. Allstate Arena was the previous location in Rosemont.

Again, great work.
2403 2018-04-14 05:57:16 No one I know here in the UK wonders if the attacks are meant to deflect; we are CERTAIN of it, and wonder whether the expensive missiles are helping Trump financially by raising values of stocks he owns. Dossier looking very accurate now #ImpeachTrumpNowASAP

2411 2018-04-14 05:40:24 Rubbish. The UN did a clear and detailed report in 2013. And Syria then agreed to destroy its weapon stocks. You can read it after searching on Google. That's the search bar thing that links you to the outside world.

2428 2018-04-14 05:05:45 Strong Advice: if you #investing in #crypto or #stocks be sure to study charts. Know what you are doing before investing. Don’t just throw money and expect to become a millionaire. Invest your money the smart way. Find patterns in charts. #weekendreads

2431 2018-04-14 05:01:41 I honestly can't recall but it was definitely more than bump stocks. Assault rifles bump stocks back ground checks hmmm what else....
2432 2018-04-14 05:00:40 It seems to me thatthose which are more able to aid the unable, are less likely to aid than the unable among themselves, aiding each other. The poor, who see life not in stocks and percentages, but in daily bread, realisemore their little excess, than the rich their great excess.
2433 2018-04-14 04:58:39 Asking for what????  Tell me, what he asked for? I saw it that day, did you? He said no more bump stocks. Who cares. Those are toys
2434 2018-04-14 04:57:43 What did he ask for? To get rid of bump stocks? That's a novelty that any real gun owner will tell you is bs that messes with accuracy. I'm still waiting for your "real news" sources. Hurry getting impatient to block your fester face
2435 2018-04-14 04:57:36 Thank you for your input.

2441 2018-04-14 04:49:24 If you need stock market-like  returns of your assets, you should be in stocks much  more often than out. In practice, it isn’t always easy or obvious, but  it is better than the alternative—increased trading, fees, complexity  and myopia—likely leading to lower returns. 1/2
2442 2018-04-14 04:48:46 I'm in shock at my broker who liquidated 650 shares of 1 of my positions for a 65$ margin after the stock went down a little. Go away for a week to come back to this #wtf Do not use @Questrade  if you live in Canada!!! #stocks $aapl $tsla

2466 2018-04-14 04:25:25 Its purely a staged chemical weapon attack. Stocks coming fr US or Britain for the sake of bombing Syria
2467 2018-04-14 04:25:23 I respect Ernie Crey's perspective re hazard to Fraser fish stocks via dilute #bitumen shipped by rail.
The problem is dilute bitumen.
It's still a hazard to fishery in form of a marine spill mirroring of Exxon Valdez.
That's why coastal #FirstNations likely oppose #KinderMorgan.

ALL types of chemical weapons must be banned, but chemical fertilizers, fertilizers on fruits, on live stocks are equally harmful. It is killing us very slowly, but steadily, abnormal secretion of glands, and behavior of humans, think and take necessary actions. thank you.

2475 2018-04-14 04:09:55 *checks news*

Yeah, your trading desk friends were wrong.  Were these the same guys that told us to buy .coms in 2000, and housing/banking stocks in 2009, and bitcoin early this year?

You guys kinda suck at doing actual news.  But you're very good at hype.

Sorry dude, know u mean well but stop using net 4 sources. Hook up w/ real minute by minute news. I knew #SyriaStrikes 8am hence sold my #stocks
2481 2018-04-14 04:03:29 The fact that we have visual on DROPPING barrel bombs, observation of chlorine, and visual of alleged bomb remnants is a LEGIT excuse to target any KNOWN CW stocks or facilities useful for delivery. Trump is minimizing response overall, but being hard-ass about any sign of WMD.
2482 2018-04-14 04:02:31 Which chemical weapons does the US supposedly own? It destroyed the last reserves - World War 2-era stocks - in 2015.

2485 2018-04-14 04:01:07 Ultimately, the scene from the trailer where Amy can’t find clothes in a store is a prime example of my problem w this movie bc someone like Amy has never walked into a mall & not been able to find a single store that stocks her size & still she’s profiting from that experience.
2486 2018-04-14 04:00:48 Both are excellent stocks.. keep it till ur target profit..
2487 2018-04-14 03:59:40 I’d love to see the answers to this if stocks were up today.  Bet 50%+ would say “NO”.

2493 2018-04-14 03:55:21 Market Facts

You'll find a lot of people giving you an advice on buying stocks. And the most interesting part is that they give you the tips without even analyzing the underlying business, cash flows, and balance sheet. stay away from those people from whome you may get trapped
2494 2018-04-14 03:55:18 Canadian energy stocks were REALLY good to me, and have been for the last week or so. Sitting on small positions in
$BNP 3.17% dividend, trading at 0.66x cash flow, 0.22x book value. Crazy.
$CVE 1.6% dividend, 0.92x sales, 0.78x book value
These valuations are CRAZY cheap.
2495 2018-04-14 03:54:56 Series 7?  They don't sell stocks?
2496 2018-04-14 03:49:00 taxes are expense to corporations and cut in taxes helps in creating higher profits,, higher profits means higher stocks prices, more investments more jobs(creating bigger tax base, more taxes to gov't)..

2536 2018-04-14 03:04:56 No trump did. Via twitter. Gave them 5 days notice to move assets including the stocks piles of chemical weapons they had to a safe location. This is a distraction & just more proof he is in bed with Russians. If he really wanted to do something HE WOULD NOT HAVE TWEETED THEM.
2537 2018-04-14 03:04:16 *stocks up on ramen and sriracha.
2538 2018-04-14 03:03:53 Sure markets like crypto currency will rally because of the Syria crisis and perhaps some defense stocks are going to as well plus oil but let's not forget that real life's are being terrorize as I type this tweet so be grateful that you are not in their situation & give a prayer
2539 2018-04-14 03:03:13 Everyone watch arms industry stocks next week lol
2540 2018-04-14 03:02:48 Sir, good morning...i see that you are talking of all....icluding IT stocks, but completely avoiding any reference to TCS....your brothers have TCS 3000 pe...@83 and next day you advised to add one more....please don't just ignore us...
2541 2018-04-14 03:01:34 You'll find a lot of people giving you an advice on buying stocks. And the most interesting part is that they give you the tips without even analyzing the underlying business, cash flows, and balance sheet.
2542 2018-04-14 03:00:01 legit nowhere stocks tall clothing in store. I’m sick of wearing shit that’s too short . Online has the smallest selection also. Pisstake.
2543 2018-04-14 02:58:41 @jimcramer  Watched FAUDA and decided to buy more NFLX stocks. When you know your customers you are easily a winner

2546 2018-04-14 02:55:23 Defense stocks up big on Monday. SAD
2547 2018-04-14 02:54:59 There are some seriously overvalued stocks on the market...
2548 2018-04-14 02:52:57 EMERGING MARKETS-Rouble rises, EM stocks set for first weekly gain in a month @Eight_Banal
2549 2018-04-14 02:52:49 Fundamentals always look best before the market turn.  Price action is weak, sentiment is at extremes, and cash balances are at record lows.  Fwd P/Es are not cheap any way you look at them, and US v Russia is a huge deal, you’re downplaying it, stocks will be down big Monday
2550 2018-04-14 02:52:39 NFLX pump will add to it. Tech stocks hit 53wk high
2551 2018-04-14 02:52:25 Lol, not really. We were both on out last stocks, but he was at low percents. I went for the greed read, and tried to stone as he chased me into the blastzone. He got it right before stone came out, and confirmed uair for the kill.

I am excited to see what Russia will do, I am sure China will give Russian money. — 觉得很疯狂
2555 2018-04-14 02:48:01 Pour punir Bachar qui aurait tué son peuple, on balance des missiles sur ce même peuple !!!!!
Les stocks supposés de gaz toxiques vont être bombardés et vont ainsi se disperser dans l’atmosphère ? Pourvu que le vent souffle vers Israël !!!
A moins que ces stocks n’existent pas ?
2556 2018-04-14 02:47:34 Yes, but did Trump, Icahn, etc. beef up their investment portfolios with military contractor stocks?
2557 2018-04-14 02:45:29 Thats because to you and @NancyPelosi an extra $1,000 is a mortgage payment. But the fact that y'all have inside information on stocks and other money making techniques doesn't slip by us #Deplorables #MAGA
2558 2018-04-14 02:44:23 The Syrian gas event lies squarely at the feet of @JohnKerry, Mr. Echo Chamber Ben Rhodes and @BarackObama. They lied to us that all Syrian chemical stocks had been secured/destroyed.
2559 2018-04-14 02:44:18 *Watches US media stocks*

Trump just deployed the most profitable product media knows: war. Clown world intensifies.
2560 2018-04-14 02:44:00 congrats 
2561 2018-04-14 02:39:57 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around

2569 2018-04-14 02:31:20 Because the 2nd amendment was written with bump stocks in mind 
2570 2018-04-14 02:31:15 Hey Coach stocks.. Congratulations on the draft. Great selections. and great job overall.
2571 2018-04-14 02:30:12 Congressional approval and stop the laudatory talk about and to Putin.  Trump is a known liar and the entire world doesn't take him seriously.  So he strikes the Syrian people and Trump's Ratheon stocks go up and we are distracted?  Putin and Assad continue the chemical attacks.
2572 2018-04-14 02:29:59 I'm hearing BTFD speak to me I'm hearing
2573 2018-04-14 02:26:57 Works well in stocks and alts, can't remember last time I used it on btc
2574 2018-04-14 02:25:59 Then what is the best way to buy silver? Which stocks?
2575 2018-04-14 02:25:57 Lower taxes, bonuses, lowest unemployment rate for blacks n Hispanics, 3 million new jobs, wages up, manufacturing up bigly, Gorsuch, stocks up, border wall, deporting criminals, talks with NK, China lowering tariffs, changing NAFTA, MAGA!
2576 2018-04-14 02:25:22 Mess. Haven't seen the target set yet, however reports are the Bolton won and target set wider than Mattis' recommendations. This was telegraphed 3 days ago by Pres and Pence. Suspect most valuable systems/stocks already moved. We know AF platforms were moved.
2577 2018-04-14 02:23:41 He has never encouraged anyone to invest in crypto. Why would he. He manages stocks.
2578 2018-04-14 02:23:41 Leave it to Trump to wait for the market to close to start dropping bombs lol. By Monday morning nobody gives a shit and defense stocks lead us to new highs. #fuckit
2579 2018-04-14 02:22:33 I saw life coming back into the weed stocks and cryptos, but I have a difficult time believing it... have you had that problem, and if so how did you get over it?
2580 2018-04-14 02:21:59 Boeing  Raytheon and Lockheed Martin  stocks about to go up.
2581 2018-04-14 02:21:54 Melon stocks dropping already. This is exactly what you get for disrespecting Twice. Twice are immortal beings. Disrespect them,you're doomed forever. GG stans still haven't learned anything yet after all this time. When will they pay attention to their surroundings?
2582 2018-04-14 02:21:30 Q to Mattis: Can you be sure chem weapon materials from facilities near Damascus we struck won't affect civilians?

Mattis: Of course not.

Who cares, right? Blow up poison gas stocks & there goes the neighborhood. Let's hope kids are upwind, or we're the "animals" #SyriaStrikes
2583 2018-04-14 02:21:05 You’re living in a BTD world. Fed is hiking, it’s over.  Stocks are good my down, wake up
2584 2018-04-14 02:20:59 I was just pointing out Hypocrisy. 
Nation states that refuse to give up their chemical weapons, refuse to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, join the OPCW and destroy their chemical weapons stocks complain about others doing the same!
2585 2018-04-14 02:19:24 Stocks going to rally hard Monday.. the event risk has been realized and passed.. and is now labeled as a one off limited action.. Russian forces didn’t react or respond either.. This is a lot more benign than market feared $SPY

2587 2018-04-14 02:18:20 Yea, it was looked at early in 2003. Primarily as US was still in mistaken belief that Saddam had active chem weapons program and so assumed it must have gone somewhere. later US learned Iraqi program was defunct and no transfer of even old weapons stocks.
2588 2018-04-14 02:17:49 I was just pointing out Hypocrisy.

2590 2018-04-14 02:17:13 He is justifying the prospective death of civilians right now. Behind the scenes the arms manufacturers are celebrating hoping for big boosts to their stocks. The MI6/CIA loyalist media are celebrating the potential WWlll actions they have been clamoring for too.
2591 2018-04-14 02:17:06 Good looks to the military complex on another couple million people dead stocks rising
2592 2018-04-14 02:16:35 if you've checked the stocks and it supposely tallied even after messing up one person's order, that means you either ordered less or you messed up someone else's orders too??
2593 2018-04-14 02:16:28 Bro when you're done with your DD here you're gonna wanna turn this trade into an investment. It's also one of only a handful of Mass. stocks and their rec legalization coming quick. Nevada sales rampin like AZ already have, Cali news coming, NJ too. Hedge funds invested. My fav.
2594 2018-04-14 02:15:06 Reading these comments you people are disgusting. How about f*** Assad??? The murderous heathen? No you got to keep going on with your Trump bashing and your hateful words. Grow up no one's taking you seriously anymore anyway. Laughing stocks.
2595 2018-04-14 02:14:18 What are you going to buy instead stocks that actually go up? 
2596 2018-04-14 02:13:54 If Trump really wants to protect women & children from violence, why not ban AR-15's and bump stocks right at home here. He doesn't have to waste millions on bombs that way.

2601 2018-04-14 02:10:25 I really can't with frozen food like I'm okay with their taste but after eating them my stomach would demand toilet

but mom only stocks frozen food
2602 2018-04-14 02:07:55 Man.. That was a cool. dope conversation. 
2603 2018-04-14 02:07:23 Aux énervés qui parlent d'un début de IIIe guerre mondiale, ou d'une Iraq bis : Les frappes militaires concerneront uniquement les stocks d'armes chimiques que Bachar a en sa possession, et dont il devait se débarrasser. Le risque que des civils soient touchés est minime.
2604 2018-04-14 02:05:38 More death isn't the answer.

Besides, pelting them with rotten produce while they're locked in the stocks in a public square is far more satisfying.

2607 2018-04-14 02:04:08 Lol, dumb ass, Russians have been on the ground for years... They got back heads up BTW... Boys just wanna play with their toys and shift some markets to build up some more... Now is time to buy the right stocks.
2608 2018-04-14 02:03:16 @BrianSozzi Brian your commentary is very much appreciated, are there certain stocks that you would buy if the futures do tumble on Sunday or would you go short? Thanks
2609 2018-04-14 02:02:44 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi  if you want true democracy set term limits for both the senate and the House.  You’ve become millionaires with your inside trades, you make laws that benefit your stocks!
2610 2018-04-14 02:01:40 No hiding the tiny hands and milk bags under the eyes. Hope you dont own stocks? Except oil! Lol
2611 2018-04-14 02:01:25 i'm at a stocks seminar and the speaker reminds me of ok taecyon??????
2612 2018-04-14 02:00:58 These responses make me wonder who has stocks in Sony but dumb jokes aside, you’re point was made yet they made their disdain for Microsoft blind them for what was said
2613 2018-04-14 02:00:44 The less bump stocks here the better so I hope so 
2614 2018-04-14 01:58:59 @matteorenzi  Mentre gli americani in accordo con Londra e Parigi stanno in Siria e iniziano a bombardare gli stocks di arme chimiche, in Italia  gente incompetente litiga  per non fare un governo ...
2615 2018-04-14 01:58:03 I will absolutely remember that he chose our children over others’ irresponsible need for bump stocks and high capacity magazines. No one needs those more than our children need their lives!
2616 2018-04-14 01:57:58 War inventory and the likes clearance -> more spending to replenish (govt spending ; defense stocks ) ; oil prices  -> energy sector  -> spy  -> affect others. Historically, markets have always gone up most of the time. Risk: Interest rate spike
2617 2018-04-14 01:57:39 I have to keep telling myself that a better world is possible despite all evidence to the contrary. People are trash and are literally okay with bombing people to see weapon stocks go up
2618 2018-04-14 01:57:37 Just checking you're portfolio, stocks in many oil and gas related industries. Is that why you want war? Kill many so you can get rich. You're sick.
2619 2018-04-14 01:57:25 $BTC wondering if the recent rapid 20% rise has anything to do w the Syrian matter. Gold stocks didn't seem to react -  IMHO
2620 2018-04-14 01:56:32 Oil going up.......watch Straits of Hormuz(sp?).......
Defense stocks higher.......
2621 2018-04-14 01:56:31 #Thisisgettinggood    Now  @jhnkelly   has   shown   he  isnt   any  better  than  trump   so  now  he  might  be  the  next  one  out    of that   house of chaos   &  I  don't  blame those  people thatleft  but  they  were  either  crooks  or laughing stocks everyday.
2622 2018-04-14 01:55:19 If you bomb chemical weapon facilities, aren't you releasing chemicals into the air? Watch defense stocks tomorrow.
2623 2018-04-14 01:54:12 " I am Banning bump stocks, they are gone... I'm doing away with them, and I don't care what Congress has to say about it, they are gone"

- Donald Trump, on live television
2624 2018-04-14 01:53:15 New policy is apparently that strategic military engagement only occurs on weekends so there’s lots of time to jawbone stocks higher by Monday morning.
2625 2018-04-14 01:52:50 How #SyriaStrikes are different this time:
1.Multiple sites targeted, #Damascus too
2.List of targets grows: airbases of Republican Guards, regime assets, #IRGC controlled base, chemical weapons stocks
3.#Syria launches air defense, claims intercepting missiles
4. France & UK in.
2626 2018-04-14 01:51:35 I refuse to trade any #wartime stocks. #SyriaStrikes
2627 2018-04-14 01:51:01 did you get a raise???Anyone you know get one? Stocks are down 2000 points in 2018 (as of today). Up 4k in 2017 so that is net +2,000. Stocks were +18,000 points during 8 years of Obama, after the crash. I guess you didn't invest or you would have known that.
2628 2018-04-14 01:48:46 8) 14 day waiting period to purchase other guns (handguns, bolt action rifles). 
9) Ban bump stocks & accessories which can modify semi-auto into auto. 
(4)
2629 2018-04-14 01:48:24 Are Asian stock markets open this weekend? How does this play on oil stocks? This puts the Russia-Iran pipeline that much closer.
2630 2018-04-14 01:47:51 Bump stocks and background check loopholes are strategic targets.
2631 2018-04-14 01:45:08 COT data doesn't correlate the same way with all commodities. And, with oil, I've never seen much consistency. I just liked the technical picture of oil and the energy stocks two weeks ago.
2632 2018-04-14 01:44:56 @AceHardware for resuming your ad campaign for @IngrahamAngle you may as well put the final nail in your coffin and start selling bump-stocks. Bastards!
2633 2018-04-14 01:41:53 Gotta boost those defense stocks
2634 2018-04-14 01:41:17 My stocks nose dive every time he breathes in a mic...
2635 2018-04-14 01:40:22 Remember how I said the chart of the U.S. was set of in"warlike aspects".Remember WAAAAY back when no one did I extolled military stocks?
2636 2018-04-14 01:39:26 Consider all the big bucks Trump & his rich buds will make from their stocks in the war biz due to his most recent bombing.  Was his prior
announcement a heads-up to Putin?
2637 2018-04-14 01:38:37 Antoine Léaument: les cibles sont extrêmement limitées et ne concernent uniquement les stocks d’armes chimiques détenues illégalement par Bachar.
2638 2018-04-14 01:37:49 You spoke too soon, i can see it on Monday already. “Trump shoots rockets, stocks crash because people are scared”
2639 2018-04-14 01:37:24 Thanks but you generally you don't share name of your stocks directly...Why this time? Just surprised
2640 2018-04-14 01:37:19 Yeah I have heard about it, am using stocks to trade now
2641 2018-04-14 01:34:46 Be on pay shit when i sell stocks
2642 2018-04-14 01:34:08 By March of 2000, the bubble had started to burst, and by the end of the year, the sector had lost $1.7 trillion in value. Then came 9/11, followed by the Enron and Worldcom scandals. By September 2002, the nasdaq, where most technology stocks were traded, was down almost 77%
2643 2018-04-14 01:34:07 He’s a loser. He isn’t the right president. He focuses on gossip instead of his job. Sure the economy has done great but stocks have had their low lows.
2644 2018-04-14 01:33:42 Feeling bullish on defense sector stocks. Slightly bearish on the future of the human race... #Invest your money accordingly

2655 2018-04-14 01:29:38 Hillbots wanted him impeached immediately for being a Russian puppet so they were talking about impeaching him, they just didn't care about him killing Syrians to boost defense stocks the first time & I doubt they will care this time because Pence would do the same shit.
2656 2018-04-14 01:29:34 3 .. I'd have my choice of women from all time .. and it would sure be nice to know which stocks to buy and what all the lottery numbers would be when betting
2657 2018-04-14 01:28:47 Defense stocks on Monday 
2658 2018-04-14 01:28:39 This isn’t true. @BetoORourke along with 95% of Americans want Universal Background checks and bans on BUMP stocks. Nice try.

2670 2018-04-14 01:16:18 US money supply growth level at 1.88% is the most significant decline in money growth since before the Great Recession (2007-2009). US stocks & property values are at risk of a major decline unless there is immediate turnaround. Aust already on a knife edge #auseconomy #auspol
2671 2018-04-14 01:16:16 Agree.  Stocks likely green on Monday morning.
2672 2018-04-14 01:16:08 Time to invest in "War" stocks, 10 year war on the horizon.
2673 2018-04-14 01:15:44 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your carpal tunnel syndrome
2674 2018-04-14 01:15:26 Great for military stocks.
2675 2018-04-14 01:15:15 who cares what trump says lets look at his accomplishments like record high stocks, repeal of obamacare mandate, tax cuts etc. 

meanwhile you pick on bill clintons mixed son because you're such a failure of a reporter that you have to bully someone from arkansas...
2676 2018-04-14 01:15:04 I seem to be getting some flack for a comment I made in my video tonight saying "Watch for this move to be faded". The truth is, the downtrend is still in place on many Cannabis stocks Daily Charts.  One 7-15% day doesn't change that.
2677 2018-04-14 01:14:32 $WEED halted, and cannabis stocks stage huge rally after Trump-Gardner discussion about state level regulation instead of federal.  #stocks #marijuana #markets #trading #cannabis #420 #tothemoon #aphria #canopygrowth

2689 2018-04-14 01:03:59 Buy Oil stocks and fill up your gas tanks. Now.
2690 2018-04-14 01:03:48 The trick with options is put in there what you are willing to lose, if  account is at 400 and you can afford to lose 40, put 40 max in there and so on. Options are like penny stocks on crack
2691 2018-04-14 01:03:08 I’m rueing the day that I didn’t have the foresight to create a sex scandal with Trump et al too? I could be retiring on the hush money or at least, investing in oil stocks.
2692 2018-04-14 01:03:02 That... and the fact that since news companies' stocks began to be traded on the market, executives/leaders of these companies (or of a broadcast network's news division) have viewed news as "something which has to turn a profit for shareholders."
2693 2018-04-14 01:02:01 you got it. Look at the oil prices. Both the US and Russia benefit from the rising prices, Europe not so much. lol Energy stocks are surging. This wouldn't be the case if the ME was stable. So, the tools in the EU just helping Russia, and the US,  Fantastic morons in the EU.
2694 2018-04-14 01:01:52 Unfortunately, Luke, I don't who stocks The Ring in Australia. Subscription is your best bet. You'll get the magazine at least two weeks earlier than any outlet.

2697 2018-04-14 01:00:02 Inside my soul there is a box
Where I hide my monsters away
Dark and rusty and in their stocks
Hiden away where no one knows
Is where they're going to stay
The dark halves of myself
The part of which I'm ashamed
Escape could lead me astray

2709 2018-04-14 00:47:01 Oh Lord. Yes, that's why the N word was used and Ted Nugent threatened assassination. But I love the tired and false socialism pull. Fox News BS. Remember, the economy crashed under Bush costing the economy billions. People lost jobs, home values, and 401K/stocks/investments.
2710 2018-04-14 00:47:00 I think there should still be medieval forms of social punishment. You say some head ass shit you get put in stocks in the town square
2711 2018-04-14 00:46:51 Momentum stocks with stops below can be profitable
2712 2018-04-14 00:46:03 Wall Street is hoping that first-quarter earnings growth and corporate forecasts are strong enough to bring the FAANG group of stocks back into favor and take the spotlight off worries that caused the recent sell-off in the high-flying group.
2713 2018-04-14 00:45:33 Wall Street is hoping that first-quarter earnings growth and corporate forecasts are strong enough to bring the FAANG group of stocks back into favor and take the spotlight off worries that caused the recent sell-off in the high-flying group.

2717 2018-04-14 00:40:50 So, how does one go about determining non-shady cannabis stocks, at this juncture?
2718 2018-04-14 00:35:46 The Australian Securities Exchange has moved to crack down on the number of Chinese companies seeking to list on the exchange this year,

China- based cos. among the ASX’s worst performing sub-sector, with 76% of stocks listed since 2010 trading below their issue price,
2719 2018-04-14 00:35:29 At least through Twitter we can all see through everyone! Sad eh? The way of the world as we now know it. No Santa Claus, No fair play, just everyone revealing all the ills if the world like NO FUCKING PENSION for all those 1950’s UK born women. Despot government! Get the stocks!
2720 2018-04-14 00:33:43 My experience with ASCM has always been - ASCM walks stocks down to the floor and then disappears. What gives here? Is it riding up just to blow it down?
2721 2018-04-14 00:32:51 This article is pretty damn useless... Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook. Wow really took a ton of research to predict these... also literally no one considers these “cheap” stocks.
2722 2018-04-14 00:31:26 Almost took my last tweet down bc the only thing that validates an investment strategy is performance.   And I know that.  But this is HUGE.  The wave is outside-in globally and inside-out domestically.   Banking is next.

MOST #cannabis stocks are shady so pls do ur work.

2741 2018-04-14 00:15:25 But, make sure she stocks up on booze.
2742 2018-04-14 00:15:10 Thanks - don’t follow a lot of junior mining stocks/charts as it has not been a great strategy for almost ever. Now weed stocks .... squirt squirt squirt thanks again appreciate it.

2744 2018-04-14 00:12:36 ...people still trade stocks like Netflix? Lol...too much risk for very little reward. And cryptocurrency traders are called fools..smh
2745 2018-04-14 00:11:42 The non ethical politicians were voted out and stopped in 2016 . Economy is growing , your 401 and stocks are doing incredibly well, people are finding jobs. Unemployment is at an all time low. 
Not to bad for all of the stonewalling this Administration is getting.
2746 2018-04-14 00:11:05 We get the point about not all low PE stocks mean they have value. We just don’t think Micron falls into that category. DRAM is still in tight supply, demand strong and ASP going up for foreseeable future and NAND ASP is stabilizing in 2H18 and demand is strong.
2747 2018-04-14 00:08:19 The banks decline in stocks after earnings increase is only a temporary fix. Banks don’t make loans, this is there business to Loan money.
2748 2018-04-14 00:07:47 Great deals for whom? Ultra-rich, despoilers of the environment, bankers, and those who know what Trump's about to say to bounce the stock market down temporarily to short stocks seem to be getting a pretty good deal!

An AR15 is not a machine gun, it's just a scary looking hunting rifle. Ban bump stocks, improve background checks, pass red flag laws

2803 2018-04-13 23:29:16 @mattswider I came across your article on iPhone issues. I upgraded my 8+ to 11.3 on Sunday. Since then I cannot open native apps like mail, stocks, notes, iTunes Store, compass, reminders, or music. But apps store, calendar, maps, tips, messages & phone all work.  Help !
2804 2018-04-13 23:28:03 Decent idea, not sure how this would work during Canada's brutal winters. And, bear in mind, if the pipeline issue isn't solved, Canada will be dead in the portfolio of international investors for awhile. Sell your Canadian stocks if you think BC will block and KM pulls out.

2806 2018-04-13 23:26:35 I'm no bear expert, but I'm fairly certain they're trying to keep their honey stocks out of our grasp...

2810 2018-04-13 23:22:18 @tomwfranck 
I am aware that I am not using the correct terminology regarding stocks. Ok, so I don't work in the investment field, BUT I can see what stocks go up and down. He and Tesla are not a good bet! He is a "Good Talker" These are all pieces
2811 2018-04-13 23:20:30 I'll wait while you gather your evidence that shows he's in a world of trouble. Stocks up. Housing up. Consumer confidence up. Black employment up. Employment up. Taxes down. He's winning and this is a witch hunt. Real issue is Hillary Clinton who has committed real crimes.
2812 2018-04-13 23:20:19 Tbh I struggled with this placement the most. I can defs see arguments for the MU being even. My final argument for the placing was that Pits are too honest and while Peach and Pits need to hard commit for their kills Peach is deceptive enough that she can seal stocks & keep hers
2813 2018-04-13 23:18:51 everyone is questioning him and melon too. melon stocks dropped lmao

2816 2018-04-13 23:17:56 I can only imagine... the Meijer near where I work stocks Jeni’s now, but only three flavors, and I buy a pint on my lunch break once a week and justify it because I’m helping keep the demand for it up. And I just eat it at my desk and don’t share it at all. Highlight of my life.

2820 2018-04-13 23:15:44 Everybody is racist, if they disagree w/u, adultery did not end your support for Dems, PR is a sh1thole, banned Obama approved bump stocks, talked abt how women react to celebrities, u wake up insulted, simmering since 11/2016. You need help.
2821 2018-04-13 23:15:14 The CBO now reports that 80% of all the economic gains from Trump's tax cuts will go to nations other than the US.

I told you all this 4 months ago.  50% of US stocks are owned by non-US citizens.  Another bulk of the companies receiving the tax breaks are non-American companies
2822 2018-04-13 23:11:01 THAT IS A SHAME I AM A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN AND I AM WILLING TO PAY YOU 50 THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT BIBLE CHRISTINE, I OWN CINNABON STOCKS I CAN AFFORD IT FOR I AM A BUSINESS MAN
2823 2018-04-13 23:10:12 And their stocks soared....that’s what freedom looks like!
2824 2018-04-13 23:10:06 Those are good points.  I really don't know.  I think that people need to return to looking at stocks as shares of companies, not just units of measure, if that makes any sense.

2826 2018-04-13 23:08:12 I don't post too much on Twitter except from time to time about stocks etc.  Great place to learn is @TradeWithTechs . Great group of people that I have been fortunate to be around. Enjoy your weekend everyone.
2827 2018-04-13 23:07:28 Lol wow you're a raging bitch.  You know exactly what I was saying, don't act as if you didn't.  

You are oblivious to what is going on if you don't see it or you just don't care.  

So they ban the AR-15 and bump stocks... Does it end there?
2828 2018-04-13 23:07:21 Me too
2829 2018-04-13 23:07:04 Well I know what I'm doing in the morning.  Dumping the rest of my Wells Fargo stock.  Maybe I'll but more renewable energy stocks.

2834 2018-04-13 23:05:02 @redideo where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2835 2018-04-13 23:04:06 @cvpayne Picture our economy and stock market after Trump sensibly manages the multiple messes Obama/Bush/(2) Clintons left us. Stocks still have a long way to revert to mean (8% return) after 18 years of sub-5% growth, crimping retirements and pensions. Dems will kill it dead.
2836 2018-04-13 23:03:20 That’s fine, just managed to see Frank Turners concert whilst being a Kangaroos pouch, I’m living the dream

2838 2018-04-13 23:02:14 #Stocks,#Indexes Wasn't really a "CORRECTION". Signal was not missed, just completed after we concluded it would not.
2839 2018-04-13 23:01:31 Didnt watch it anyway
2840 2018-04-13 23:01:14 And of course as always the innocent suffer for the tyranny and adgendas of others. The news never reports on the whole story just whatever slant will sell news and lead public opionion on stocks etc.
2841 2018-04-13 23:00:40 I can't wait to see her work with the rest of the team!
2842 2018-04-13 23:00:33 You confuse stocks with flows, like confusing a balance sheet with a cash-flow statement.Our CO2 emissions are new CO2 that was locked away for millions of years. The CO2 from plants and soils is already in the cycle. Please get this right.

2845 2018-04-13 22:59:36 No, the stock market is only an indicator of the wealth of corporations and the elite class. Less than 50% of the people own stocks. The current regime is lining its own pockets by lowering their taxes & giving measly one-time bonuses to workers. Power does not come from stocks.
2846 2018-04-13 22:59:21 Investing in BTC has me mind blown. I’m actually making profit from stocks
2847 2018-04-13 22:59:11 aye mate scurry off or ill run u over u fucking kangaroos pouch
2848 2018-04-13 22:58:17 when we shame you, it is for life, remember that life! the stocks are one way, there is no out, and we throw fruit at you too. The pennance for your behavior is a lifetime sentence.
2849 2018-04-13 22:58:15 This is comedy
2850 2018-04-13 22:57:51 Don’t need to kill myself anymore, just seen the entire concert without paying, I’m quite good thanks xxxx
2851 2018-04-13 22:57:06 Bitcoin and stocks were both up for the week. I got paid today trying to figure out where to put it.
2852 2018-04-13 22:56:12 Stocks: for indices by structure I mean cycle trans are neutral to bearish not bullish.
2853 2018-04-13 22:55:56 Great numbers on Stocks and the United States must be able to lose weight fast!
2854 2018-04-13 22:54:31 Dude, you’ve totally lost your sh~~t. “Nightmare”? Better growth, low unemployment,minority employment at record hi’s, hi stocks, lower regs, still have health ins, noko wants to talk, AND ISIS is toast. If you think this is nightmarish, wtf did we go thru w you&Obama?
2855 2018-04-13 22:53:56 We, in India, always considered the @wwos to be the gold standard for cricket broadcasting. On reading views expressed in certain sections of the media, it seems the converse is true in Australia, atleast recently. What has contributed to the deteriorating stocks of Channel 9 ?
2856 2018-04-13 22:53:05 Conflating a few things here.

By any definition the collapse from 20k is a burst bubble - 1929, Nikkei, Nasdaq. But that doesn’t mean the end of BTC like it didn’t mean the end of stocks.

Where and what BTC does now is the interesting question.

On that I think it sticks around
2857 2018-04-13 22:53:04 ive now stopped everyone from seeing it apart from u now just to spite u cunt
2858 2018-04-13 22:52:42 think of something funny and then kill urself so u go out on a good note, rather than just a fat mess x

2862 2018-04-13 22:49:20 Pro stocks were cooler when the air cleaners all stuck through the hood
2863 2018-04-13 22:49:19 same as all the other coin. I mean they all have products! Products are not the coins! people should understand that! coins are acting as stocks of the company in this case the company is very valuable!
2864 2018-04-13 22:48:48 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Hi Jim, <3 ur show! Been researching 'baby' Car-T pharma stocks with promising pipelines.  Look at $ADAP, $CLLS and my fav so far, $BLCM.   Bec of the symposium in Chicago this wknd, I took a nibble of all 3 but want to focus on just 1 for my spec stock. Thoughts?
2865 2018-04-13 22:48:46 Cramer on the Cartoon Channel talking about MDMG and mentioned @AlderLaneeggs and did not take a stand his advice avoid battleground stocks WTF my advice to Cramer grow a pair but even then you would not be a MAN like@AlderLaneegs#chickencramer
2866 2018-04-13 22:47:59 Anyone who didn’t manage to see Frank Turner live tonight, follow @Rowan_Stocks on Snapchat because he recorded the entire fucking concert
2867 2018-04-13 22:45:42 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
2868 2018-04-13 22:45:36 Every time you tweet my stocks go down.
2869 2018-04-13 22:45:35 You will not win valuation of a security, no matter the controversy, with the ballot of the people.  You will win Republican elections, but you will not decide the fate of stocks, bonds, and everything in between with such nonsense.  Business is not democratic.

2884 2018-04-13 22:34:44 Wilbur Ross doesn’t own steel stocks any longer and he was single handily responsible for saving the US Steel industry 18 years ago.  Steel prices have been stagnant for over 10 years while several thousand steelworkers lost their well paid jobs.  Jacob you should know that.

2889 2018-04-13 22:29:40 ISIS destroyed.  NK about to be denuclearized.  China lowering tariffs.  Stocks breaking records.  Yup, what a loser.
2890 2018-04-13 22:29:30 Wow.  You guys have reported several big buys made last Friday in various oil related stocks... 
2891 2018-04-13 22:27:44 Es abismal. Va a tardar más de lo previsto pero la tendencia es claramente a la baja. 
Muchos de los ítems enumerados implicaban disminución de inversión y reducción de stocks. O sea camino al abismo seguro sin cambio de rumbo.
2892 2018-04-13 22:25:42 Guess I’ll buy some more stocks  gotta put my money somewhere

2922 2018-04-13 22:00:46 On @MotleyFoolMoney does anyone ever think about taking a count of whose stock pick Steve puts on his watch list? Like for example if it was stocks from Chris, Bill B & Jason & he pick 3 of Jason’s stock, 5 of Chris’ stock & 4 of Bill’s stock. I don’t why I just thought of that.
2923 2018-04-13 22:00:17 @OCSimpkins How often do you recommend $10 or less on new stocks you think have a good future so small or new investors can make some money?
2924 2018-04-13 21:59:10 Pokémon stocks went down 50% because of my thread
2925 2018-04-13 21:56:50 Im 60% crypto, 30% stocks, 10% precious metals.

My crypto portfolio is cut into 2 sectors. My alt coins account for about 90% of my capitol and my margin account is just for fun and also works well for hedging.
2926 2018-04-13 21:55:09 That’s like asking. How do you think about stocks? Or how do you think about businesses? Just an asinine framing

2928 2018-04-13 21:54:08 A long time ago they used to put people in stocks in the middle of town.. The citizens could walk by and throw rotten eggs, fruit, rocks ,whatever.. I always wondered if I would throw anything..
The GOP & the TRAITOR IN CHIEF have answered that ? For me..
2929 2018-04-13 21:53:13 @anilvohra69 Like today, low volume, tiny bleed in equities, junk spreads flat so clearly no fundie drivers. Just day-traders speculating on financial stocks. This market should resolve higher, possibly in explosive fashion once it gets started. Definitely not bear market action.

2933 2018-04-13 21:50:05 Any stocks out there people like right now? I have a lot of cash on the sidelines and about to have more (finally on LT capital gains on a stock at 180%+ return so I'm puking out). My investment style: small to mid-cap, recently shitty execution but good products. I love two 1/?
2934 2018-04-13 21:49:08 Il est difficile de savoir qui blâmer dans cette affaire... Le sarin provient des stocks de Saad, mais bien des dépôts d'armes chimiques et biologiques du régime sont tombés entre les mains des rebelles sunnites.
2935 2018-04-13 21:49:04 They do keep good stocks of cheese and wine,  though.
2936 2018-04-13 21:48:44 Never seen @Invest420 so happy! And it takes a lot to impress him. Love the note about no more shitty penny stocks. That's what scanners are for! Just legit "years ago I got in on the ground floor" of $___ stories in the making.

2939 2018-04-13 21:47:29 Betting against Nvidia seems like a BAD idea.  Not because of the chip stocks, but because Nvidia has some many really good areas - core graphics, self-drive, data center, cloud, AI, design studio/holodeck, and more.  You might be right, but wow...
2940 2018-04-13 21:47:15 Unless you count..lowest unemployment rate for blacks n Hispanics, tax cuts n bonuses, manufacturing up bigly, 3 million jobs, Gorsuch, talks planned with N.K., China lowering tariffs, border wall, deporting criminals,stocks up, exposing left wing media bias!

2952 2018-04-13 21:40:29 in BC: 2. Stocks of e.g. halibut have not rebuilt... So that is not acheived... either. I believe @TimEssington did a great job assessing that.

2962 2018-04-13 21:32:20 Obviously a well known problem with flows is random measurement error doesn’t cancel out like it does for stocks. If some U is coded NILF in error one month and someone NILF is coded U, it cancels out. Not true of stocks
2963 2018-04-13 21:31:20 Because enforcement of existing laws does not get you face time.  Bloviating on bump stocks and evil assault “weapons of war” gets you fawning press in this state
2964 2018-04-13 21:30:56 My thing about flows is: does the recession really stand out there as obviously a recession? Doesn’t really work as well as stocks

3050 2018-04-13 20:39:21 While Wall Street likes to use the VIX as a fear gauge, the truth is that stocks can make big moves to the upside when they become too compelling for traders on the sidelines to ignore. Under those circumstances, the VIX can also be a "greed" gauge. #InvestorTip

3083 2018-04-13 20:18:27 In The Market: A lot of #traders likely saw an "outside" down day in the #nasdaq, which usually is negative. However, a 1.5% swing from intraday low to high doesn't strike me as severe. Maybe watch this: Can the leading index retake its 50-day MA soon? #trading #stocks
3084 2018-04-13 20:16:31 Pot stocks felt a little boost as Trump handed control over legalization to the individual states. CMED was up 2.01 @ ACB 0.69 while HIP felt a negligible gain of 0.04. The ETF FIRE saw gains of 0.14.
3085 2018-04-13 20:14:33 Stocks end modestly lower on kick-off day for Q1 earns season. Dow -122, -0.5% to 24,360. Nasdaq -0.5%, S&P -0.3%.

For the week Dow +1.8%, Nasdaq +2.8%, S&P +2.0%. Which, given the D.C. backdrop, suggests investors either don't think Trump is in trouble or don't care if he is.

3093 2018-04-13 20:06:24 I can talk about MJ all day! Good on you @WLFOFMYST Only thing is, those penny stocks are only for short term trading due to convertible debt and dilution MJNA was my first stock ever in 2010. IIPR, SMG, GWPH more legit names on bigger exchanges. in IIPR big today on Trump tweet.
3094 2018-04-13 20:06:14 Would removing capital gains exemption do that, in your opinion? Or do we need something steeper? Seems to me removing PRE would also reduce incentive to buy more housing than you need because its gains are tax-free (vs. stocks or other investments).

3223 2018-04-13 18:46:26 Lessons in Bull market:
1)Stay away from IPO's,most of them comes with crazy valuations
2)Stay away from "trendy"stocks
3)Stay away from "Business news Channels"
4)Avoid "tempting" calls from your broker.
Forget Wealth creation:Save your Money first.

3227 2018-04-13 18:45:18 I made this point to a prospective client this week who was very dissolusioned with his SMPI illustration. Suggested that he should ignore the figures, crack on and do what is affordable. 

Illustrations do not give a fair reflection of the potential benefit of investing.

3233 2018-04-13 18:41:33 be laughing-stocks in the Arab world, too. No one there will take us seriously, & rightly so. Moreover, if we cave in to #Putin, our liberal democracy will be doomed. I doubt that #Trump will care (he's no liberal democrat!), but #Obama will, for sure!

3251 2018-04-13 18:32:39 DO NOT let anyone tell you that you can't do something because of your age. DO NOT think you can't start a career because you're too young or too old.

Follow your dreams, even if they change
3252 2018-04-13 18:32:28 This chart reflects USDA systematic (intentional?) overestimation of U.S. ending stocks (a practice that doesn't need to be done in the first place). Easy to blame it on consistently underestimating demand, but there is also a component of being completely wrong about production.

3312 2018-04-13 18:09:13 Again, third time, the GOP had NOTHING TO DO with the ATF 2010 ruling on bump stocks... Obama did nothing for 6 years to change the ruling within his own administration... That is a fact!
3313 2018-04-13 18:08:53 Hmm, its an idea, but I can only pin one thing, and my current one really needs to stay. I'll be looking for suggestions for both the core and garbage list this weekend. I was even thinking of a third, one for companies with paper thin margins.
3314 2018-04-13 18:08:27 You don’t need bump stocks and mags >10 for hunting.
3315 2018-04-13 18:07:46 Dividends on stocks is like earning rent on an expensive  flat bought on borrowed money where you pay EMI and of course have to bear with the maintenance charges and irritating tenants.  And of course the flat has hardly had any capital appreciation.

3318 2018-04-13 18:06:32 Consensus is stocks are a broad buy because "the economy is very strong".  Looking at different asset classes....I am not quite so sure on that.
3319 2018-04-13 18:06:15 Again, the Obama Administration had control of the ATF from 2009 to 2016 and not once did Obama do anything to get ATF to change its ruling or try to pass any laws to get bump stocks under the National Firearms Act of 1934... Not one time!

3327 2018-04-13 18:02:45 So you're just going to deny the existence of bump stocks that make those variable speeds consistent and higher?
3328 2018-04-13 18:02:44 Pot stocks really perking up again from very low levels. I don't see why they won't be the best place to make money again in 2018.

Luckily for us, Bitcoin & Pot Stocks look amazing. This is not a hard R/R decision. Big risk and small reward v. small risk and big reward.

3392 2018-04-13 17:34:05 Sometimes tough to have confidence to action the direction I am seeing -- many many smart traders are still bullish. But the $JPM thing is the most compelling reason I can see to not carry stocks long over the weekend. That needs to resolve itself and show its a fake-out first.

3400 2018-04-13 17:30:12 Last week my 5 year old recommended I sell my Facebook stocks.  "Because zuckerbergs unethical profiteering from our personal information, will cause fb stocks to dip".  And my 5 year old always says "sell high buy low."

3403 2018-04-13 17:29:25 Agree ... worked for the FB stocks ... but not the American public.  We know @facebook suppresses Conservatives & do not expect any change to that.

3413 2018-04-13 17:23:49 You are insane if you believe that crap. Very few people are getting real raises and most are only getting one time bonuses of no more than $1000.

How does that help Americans?
3447 2018-04-13 17:10:10 I actually don’t disagree with it potentially not being a bad time to purchase FB stocks due to current scandal, can’t hide away from the fact that stocks are down 7-10% and surely will only decrease.

3457 2018-04-13 17:06:24 Um, the stock is down less than a percent and volume is paltry. You're being hyperbolic. Profit taking is healthy. Stocks go up and down. It's no big deal. $SRPT

3462 2018-04-13 17:05:04 Not sure what point you're making here Aron. My point is that planning to buy an inflation linked pension in advance (and other conservative assumptions) put most people off saving. Also, these assumptions are disconnected from reality as most don't buy IL incomes in retirement.

3501 2018-04-13 16:46:19 Well if you believe the hikes and the margins are screwed across mainstreet then that hurts banks too - the stocks fell with the general market believing in rate hikes - fear and sheep following each other

3535 2018-04-13 16:34:09 Mutual funds pool money from the investing public and use that money to buy other securities, usually stocks and bonds. The value of the mutual fund company depends on the performance of the securities it decides to buy.

A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of moneys collected from many investors for the purpose of
investing in securities such as stocks , bonds , money market instruments and other assets.

3631 2018-04-13 15:51:54 FYI: I try to avoid the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes of the day. The reason is that MM's aren't held to the NBBO (National Best Bid/Offer) so spreads widen drastically on stocks and options.

3893 2018-04-13 14:03:18 "Chasing price" to the upside is not a sound investing tactic. We must focus on "clean & simple" entries. A "clean & simple" entry gives us a "clean and simple" exit if stock drops.  There, SMALL losses. #stocks
3894 2018-04-13 14:02:39 One reason  the FTSE is doing so well is that the U.K. index is benefiting from high exposure to so-called defensive stocks, which tend to do better in times of market turmoil, and low exposure to the tech sector.
3895 2018-04-13 14:02:11 Going to have to rotate to the other stocks that sat still if this run is to continue imo

3897 2018-04-13 14:01:32 Interestingly the FTSE has climbed even as the British pound has rallied. The pound’s 1.5% rise against the dollar and 1.3% gain against the euro this month should be bad for U.K. stocks because it makes British exports less competitive abroad.

4491 2018-04-13 06:45:02 I agree with you. Only that to invest part of salary profitably, you must be strategic.
Whether it’s stocks, bonds, or a business, you must spend sometime researching and making decisions. That’s the inspiration.
Savings in pensions (RSA) alone will not be enough on retirement.

4536 2018-04-13 06:00:49 I think the sell off in stocks and D/yen will hold off until next week and I expect to see Gold and Euro take off next week too and maybe actually hold onto most of the gains!

4539 2018-04-13 05:58:45 I second that. Gold is a hedging commodity mainly in times of economic trouble / war etc. Markets look to be rallying from the DOW sell off, war footings are being pegged back, BTC & real estate going sideways. I see stocks as the buy for 2018 growth now.

4620 2018-04-13 04:46:48 lol yeah bro there is no way you make that much off investments in one year. Also idk if u know how mutual funds work but they’re supposed to be diverse, so that ridiculous 17% is coming from high risk stocks which are a very small portion of your portfolio

4623 2018-04-13 04:45:32 Good question. Think odds for a negative year in stock market is high, meaning more likely stocks will end 2018 lower than start year and likely will be considerably lower sometime during the year, which we have not seen yet. So think good chance to see low bids filled this year.

But I believe that the stocks w/ silly valuations r starting process of revaluation. Haven't been taking short positions until the last few mos.
4768 2018-04-13 02:19:36 You need to worry less about who you are friends with and more about what your rash,  impulsive actions are doing to the world economy.  My stocks have lost 10%... how about yours?
4769 2018-04-13 02:18:17 So in VT an 18 year old man is old enough to be ordered off to war to kill or be killed by the gov’t but he’s not allowed to buy a gun. 

That seems fair. 

What about bump stocks that already exist in VT? Are you going to confiscate them? Will you reimburse owners or just steal?

4774 2018-04-13 02:14:56 A weird silver lining in all this is that I will continue to profit from my NWL income - I have put every cent I’ve made from the NWL into investments and my stocks are doing well....at least, right now. So, I feel incredible fortunate for that.

4776 2018-04-13 02:12:55 I think the point is that with economies of scale and business expansion etc, the profits are going to the people at the top. Real wages have been stagnant for decades, while stocks are at all time highs and the richest get richer.

4780 2018-04-13 02:08:27 If Ford wins then short HydroOne stocks because government interference in the governance will permanently reduce the stock price. Could easily cost Ontario (who still owns 47% of the stock) a billion dollars.

4786 2018-04-13 02:03:25 Obviously Ford has not considered the effect that his interference with the governance of HydroOne will have on the price of the $6 billion in HydroOne stocks that Ontario still owns. Firing the board & CEO will likely permanently reduce the price. Could cost Ontario a $billion.

4796 2018-04-13 01:54:52 Some free advice. If Ford wins short HydroOne stocks because as soon as Ford starts interfering with governance they will drop like a rock. Don't think Ford has considered that Ontario owns $6 billion of HydroOne so Ontario will take a big haircut. The man is not too bright.

4863 2018-04-13 00:55:56 Thank you, RI House for passing bills to ban bump stocks and enact a red flag law. Rhode Islanders are taking decisive action to keep our communities safe.
4864 2018-04-13 00:53:58 Just a gem... INVEST IN STOCKS YOUNG
4865 2018-04-13 00:53:15 AR-15, the rifle of choice for mass shooters.  Also bump stocks and large magazines, as I said before.
4866 2018-04-13 00:52:37 Got my stocks going up, on a Tuesday
4867 2018-04-13 00:51:21 98% off mass shootings occur in gun free areas. 
First problem is funding. They can’t afford to have armed guards at every school. 
So what’s been proposed is arming some teachers which may work. Trump has also banned bump stocks.
4868 2018-04-13 00:50:59 Thanks @realDonaldTrump
4869 2018-04-13 00:50:00 The 12-month forward price/earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has fallen from a 16-year high of 18.6 times adjusted earnings at the end of January to 16.4 times at Tuesday’s close, putting it back to where it stood in 2014,  Stocks are less expensive, above their average since 1985.
4870 2018-04-13 00:49:54 They are technically regulated but with loopholes. And with the availability of bump stocks a semi-auto might as well be. Is this really the hill we want to die on? You get the point lol
4871 2018-04-13 00:49:16 there’s a cute guy that stocks at my store sometime and he started talking to me i’m
4872 2018-04-13 00:48:02 Probably going to jinx it, but my stocks have been performing well this week. Close to finally breaking even! #stocks #investing #RobinHoodApp
4873 2018-04-13 00:46:01 Stocks close higher on earnings hopes, easing Syria fears. Dow +293 points.
4874 2018-04-13 00:44:43 Here's the issue still, for each of those ideas listed (except bump stocks, which the govt has stepped in on) theres logical reasoning, places that have strict gun laws, or an instance of a shooting that those changes wouldn't have stopped. Further, some of those infringe on 2A
4875 2018-04-13 00:43:40 I have been Green the past 4 days. Since the start of the week I have not lost a trade! Feeling great! . Only the 10% profit. #Stocks
4876 2018-04-13 00:43:31 If dilution is really gone or severely limited due to #BMIC then $RITE should be in great shape for a run #OTC #stocks #stockstowatch #BMIC was note pushing everytime their was any volume
4877 2018-04-13 00:41:49 Just like stocks day trading can be very lucrative but also very damaging to your overall wealth. $Cryptocurrency as a whole is a young and emerging market with lots of potential to gain some positions on coins and sit on them.

4879 2018-04-13 00:38:50 So be 100% honest...its not about common sense gun reform, and AR-15s, bump stocks, etc...it is about banning all guns. To say anything else would be a complete lie on your part.  Stop with your BS of common sense gun reform, and simply be honest...
4880 2018-04-13 00:38:16 Both sets I lost I got beat 2-1 need to do better taking stocks.
4881 2018-04-13 00:37:13 Enough sign up, could you do a coup like corporate stocks?

4883 2018-04-13 00:37:06 I’m tryna wield the same type of influence and power Rihanna has that made Snapchat’s stocks and value plummet. That’s what I’m after. Not likes.
4884 2018-04-13 00:36:36 NO! I saw your post on the other site and responded. I would be all over Ameritrade to figure what happened. I've never heard of that with the name brand trading Co's. Some of the off name ones have large fees but not Etrade or Ameritrade.

4887 2018-04-13 00:34:21 with all the damage to big cap tech leaders like FB etc, I'm hoping that smaller stocks can show relative strength like in 2004-2006 $COMPQ
4888 2018-04-13 00:33:41 #Stocks,#Indexes Possibility of a BOTTOM signal tomorrow, circa 1400-1500 hrs.
4889 2018-04-13 00:33:09 @TuckerCarlson @NRA If it's true @BankofAmerica  is taking a stance of not doing business with those that sell guns based on @BankofAmerica 's political stance, I will sell my stocks & move my accounts to a bank that keeps it's nose out of my purchases!!!
4890 2018-04-13 00:31:05 Not in this end of the market. There are stocks that run on no product/no revenues/no fundamentals...due to pure hype. We are making people aware of the sector and the stock as we strongly believe in it and are invested in it alongside our clients.
4891 2018-04-13 00:30:02 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
4892 2018-04-13 00:29:16 I'd say that the unwillingness to budge on common sense regulations like 10 round maximum magazines, bump stocks, deeper background checks, no gun show sales, or other types of private sale of firearms, or a law requiring the buyer to be 21 is kinda sick considering recent news
4893 2018-04-13 00:28:00 How are you going to get people who can make an AR-15 at their own homes turn in the blue prints? How are you going to stop the black market from supplying those weapons? Massachusetts can't get people to their bump stocks, but they will turn in their "recalled" guns?
4894 2018-04-13 00:26:58 Comparing price per share of two stocks is meaningless unless the market caps are identical. Proves absolutely nothing even if you’re just doing it for t and g.
4895 2018-04-13 00:25:45 Neither Russia or Syria used chemical weapons.  Where are you getting your information? In fact JAI and Al-Nusra have been shown to have chemical weapons stocks and JAI has admitted using them. No reason for Syria to use CW. Makes no sense. Look deeper. Question.
4896 2018-04-13 00:25:28 @NRA must be very happy nobody interfered with Paddock's 2A right to buy 33 assault weapons within one year, bump stocks, & thousands of rounds of ammo so he could defend himself and his family against tyranny and bad guys with guns. Or for sport. Or hunting. Or all of the above.
4897 2018-04-13 00:24:28 Bien sur, tout à fait...

4902 2018-04-13 00:21:19 At least that would ensure a republican sweep on 2020.  After increased taxes, stocks tanking, high unemployment and people losing their houses.
4903 2018-04-13 00:18:01 Yeah, bump stocks don’t make any firearm full auto. Instead of insulting me, try doing your research on firearms first. Only way to get full auto is to hold trigger down. Full autos are already banned. Don’t tweet stupid things.
4904 2018-04-13 00:17:54 Awesome!
4905 2018-04-13 00:17:26 The corp.'s are using tax cuts to buy back their stocks and giving big $ to Top Tier of Corp. not to little people. Top 10% are NOT trickling down to bottom 90%, then you all took our mortgage interests, home heating, property tax, and head of household credits/deductions away.
4906 2018-04-13 00:15:56 Omnibus for funding things like abortion, bump stocks, considering rejoining TPP, killing Russians and Syrians to help...Syrians or America? Just heard Mattis say they're looking for evidence, but in the mean time blow people and places up. Great chess game... #MAGA

4909 2018-04-13 00:12:31 Congratulations. Myself, I have not benefited from the tax cuts. I have watched our stock portfolio go up & down like a roller coaster, usually because of a single tweet. I wonder daily if we should sell stock before it drops more. We have a lot of Tech stocks.
4910 2018-04-13 00:12:08 Not so. Russia is not making it. There are 20 other sites where it could be made. OPCW certifies all adRussian CBW stocks destroyed as per the convention.

4915 2018-04-13 00:10:28 IDK 

Those are the 2 stocks in my trading account and I’d say $AAPL is holding up PFG - especially since @realDonaldTrump got pissy about Bezos being wealthier than him...

Good luck.

4923 2018-04-13 00:04:38 Uh, I’ve shot plenty of semiautomatic weapons, and seen people using bump stocks, and I do not think you can replicate that with just holding your hand loosely. Not with any accuracy, at least.
4924 2018-04-13 00:03:18 Putin has already taken a step back by wanting to take it to the UN, he backpeddled quickly after Trump landed the first costly blow, Trumps crapper tweet the other morning sent the Ruble into a nose dive, and would have wiped billions from RU stocks.
