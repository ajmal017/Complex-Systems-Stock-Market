41 2018-03-23 23:57:03 lmaoo y’all i asked @AJRoneee how many cups she had of thhe Que oil she started thinking hard asf.. couldn’t even tell me  @•
42 2018-03-23 23:57:03 We tend to just go with olive oil, salt, pepper, and oregano.
43 2018-03-23 23:57:01 Don’t you need the oil for that? Or are there different types
44 2018-03-23 23:56:58 @CONDORVINOTINTO Oil
45 2018-03-23 23:56:46 Clearly I forgot there were rules! Oh Yaa frustration bi walt?! Conditioner didn't even touch it! Later on, me and olive oil and a WHOLE LOT of patience came through ! Kw3 sticking to the shop bought sturvs
46 2018-03-23 23:56:42 Yeah, I wouldn't try hash browns with butter nor is olive oil much better. I prefer olive oil over butter for many things but they each have their own places. A kitchen should be well stocked with both and they are equally indispensable.

50 2018-03-23 23:55:59 its March.  One's life can go completely upside down in like 60 seconds.  Next week is worth watching cause China only accept juan, rubble and real gold for oil trades /transactions.   pay attention.  Nov long way away....
51 2018-03-23 23:55:59 Is that what they’re adding in everything now? I thought bio oil was for scars. I know bio oil isnt in hair products
52 2018-03-23 23:55:53 I absolutely LOVE all your products that I have tried.  I bought the Littles, and now I am addicted to your Vitamin C, the soaps, the Maroola oil and the rest of your amazing products!!
53 2018-03-23 23:55:47 Thanks! Appreciate your insight. On another note, how much CBD oil do you take?
54 2018-03-23 23:55:42 Perhaps some coconut oil might help
55 2018-03-23 23:55:36 @JaniceDean Have you tried CBD oil? It has worked for many things and you should try it.  Wishing you well.

58 2018-03-23 23:54:37 Just heard about the pay raise. What a bunch of axx'x. They must go. I remember when oil went down they raise gas tax..my state..tax cut more revenue they SPEND MORE.
59 2018-03-23 23:54:34 Exactly, it will get a bit wild next week if Shanghai really goes live on the 26ht with the Yuan-Oil-Gold backed.
60 2018-03-23 23:54:28 So online around 9pm & oil show?  I haven’t showered yet so I rather be proactive and stuffs lol
61 2018-03-23 23:54:15 My wife just told me there is a “coffee” essential oil... final one that is ACTUALLY essential :)
62 2018-03-23 23:54:14 Let me explain what is going on here. We need to understand the history of the Middle East.Psych Warfare to encourage People believe villains who do not exist.NATO using the Turks to control ME. Brits came out with WMD story.  Now knew one.Brits want the Oil. Iran threw out Brits
63 2018-03-23 23:53:51 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America

65 2018-03-23 23:53:46 It's engine oil  
66 2018-03-23 23:53:13 #CristóbalLópez Rosner inicia su salida de OIL Combustibles. La fundamenta en la "oposición" de la @AFIPcomunica a sus "propuestas tendientes a normalizar la situación operativa,económica y financiera"
67 2018-03-23 23:52:58 I might be willing to accept this argument if you didn't lead with an outright lie. It isn't speculation, rather fact that oil was in a free fall when the NDP took over.
68 2018-03-23 23:52:50 The Railroad brought a country together. The oil pipelines are driving it apart. For the record, I’d be ok with the pipeline If profits were Staying in Canada.
69 2018-03-23 23:52:49 You know what they call movies about police in wheelchairs......comedies

I would like handicapped people to be employed with sensible jobs. How about you, would you rather we put all our handicapped to work on oil rigs
70 2018-03-23 23:52:35 How much pollution have we had from pipelines or tanker traffic ? Rail lines clogged with oil freight means farmers have difficulty transporting their produce. @leadnowca's antics are not in the best interests of  Canada.
71 2018-03-23 23:52:33 Even maintaining our current use patterns requires the pipeline due to the loss of Alaskan oil to serve as feedstock for the West Coast.
72 2018-03-23 23:52:21 No one is blocking oil exports from Alberta. There is already a pipeline. This is about a pipeline expansion, Suzanne.
73 2018-03-23 23:52:19 Thank you. We need your voice of reason! I have also seen pesto made with canola oil, and I'm like, wtf no.
74 2018-03-23 23:52:18 CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS HOUSE IS 54 DEGREES BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT OF OIL AND JUST FILLED IT TODay. LIKE OK....... ARE YOU TRYING TO FUCKING KILL ME LIKE HI HELLO.
75 2018-03-23 23:52:09 Gotta be done, keep it in your community 
76 2018-03-23 23:52:07 Internal revenue won't be taxed. Imagine an integrated oil company. It will produce oil, refine it and then sell. It will get taxed only once, where if it wasn't integrated, it would've paid taxes twice
77 2018-03-23 23:52:06 The main thing the oil meme is missing are drones.
78 2018-03-23 23:51:58 I think 3 is wrong. It can be used to clean up oil spills.
79 2018-03-23 23:51:43 @AmberRuddHR watch the oil price Amber. Gas is key and you are making an enemy of Russia when our resources are very low. Energy is getting tight don’t let the us shake or renewables blind you from reality.
80 2018-03-23 23:51:25 おつだねー
81 2018-03-23 23:51:05 Why this dudes name look like penzoil high mileage vehicle motor oil with active cleansing agents.
82 2018-03-23 23:50:55 Because Vancouver is the ideal territory for solar energy right ? 
Canada has the worlds 3rd largest oil reserves, yet we import millions of barrels oil from Saudi Arabia, Dunce.
83 2018-03-23 23:50:39 Everything is happening exactly like you said! Oil moving up gold moving up stocks and bonds moving down. Emerging markets red a bit today tho... other than that everything looking good for my accounts.

85 2018-03-23 23:50:35 Where to buy palm oil.. I have missed egusi soup
86 2018-03-23 23:50:25 Because the sanctions he refuses to implement can allow the $500B oil deal to go down, and I am sure they were all offered a tasty chunk of the money to be gained from the single largest crime in the history of the world.

89 2018-03-23 23:50:04 He probably sat at a guard station to let oil tankers through.
90 2018-03-23 23:49:58 Answers? I haven't seen answers I've just read bs. No war in the last 20 years has been about protecting the United States. None of them.

94 2018-03-23 23:48:52 Er- the fridge and oil incidents are unrelated.
95 2018-03-23 23:48:44 May not last past November/January.
96 2018-03-23 23:47:55 It immediately got worse - I spilled a really expensive oil blend and had to clean my stupid dying fridge - but now I've escaped my drudgery and am just now looking lovingly at a pint of beer.
97 2018-03-23 23:47:21 Unless you hold the trigger down, than it keeps firing. And its not used for hunting, its mainly used to steal oil from the Middle East.

123 2018-03-23 23:44:39 Many people supported @abndpcaucus because you claimed you wanted to stop relying on oil revenue to balance the budget. We have an $11 billion tax advantage that goes almost exclusively to the wealthy. It’s time to do the responsible thing and raise taxes. #ableg #abpoli

137 2018-03-23 23:42:03 There is too much contradictions in Nigeria. How can government be talking about diversifying the economy when the oil resources remain largely undeveloped .The other time we exported rotten yams. 2mao we will dig out metals and export. No value addition.

142 2018-03-23 23:40:40 @realDonaldTrump why do we continue to get price gouged by the petroleum industry?

157 2018-03-23 23:38:27 Should've told that to Obama before he lifted USA export oil ban. He set back Green movement by letting dirty energy out to the world.
158 2018-03-23 23:38:15 The oil isn't ours, either!
159 2018-03-23 23:38:14 Kleiner Perkins invested in Juicero; Draper Fisher Jurvetson invested in Theranos; etc. Even experts can be and are blinded by promises in an era when tech moves so fast. The snake oil they fall for is just more expensive and better packaged.
160 2018-03-23 23:38:07 IIRC environmental bonds are tied to   Trans-mountain, and yeah a junior oil company walked away.  Pipelines are usually filled with product from many different companies.
161 2018-03-23 23:38:01 New Indigo Pro Cartridges now in stock. Beautiful oil, very tasty! Vibrating battery tells you you're getting a good draw.
162 2018-03-23 23:37:59 Linseed oil for everyone
163 2018-03-23 23:37:54 Buying fish oil and garlic supps to own the libs
164 2018-03-23 23:37:52 I have oil @ home, smile
165 2018-03-23 23:37:27 Yeah sure. Trump has made the US virtually energy free by ramping up oil production to the detriment of Russia. Google the bombing of the Wagner group in Syria! That’s why I ask sometimes if you know what you’re talking about.
166 2018-03-23 23:37:22 He’s dead. Why is IS targeting France and is IS supported by 
Assad and Putin?

IS or ISIS gets most of it’s revenue from Syria in the form of Oil and Gas revenues.

Os this like Silicon Valley running its own show in the USA or are they part of the state like Huwei/China.

168 2018-03-23 23:37:03 @Zak_Bagans Did you ever do any testing on the oil found on the blinds?
169 2018-03-23 23:37:00 A great *snake oil* salesman

FTFY
170 2018-03-23 23:36:52 I just bought a cool new Alienware PC The media lies! They’re all just a bunch of fruitless pies! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
171 2018-03-23 23:36:42 Mid lang then get a pan cover. Put a pinch of salt in the oil so that it won’t pop then grab the pan cover use it as your shield ri
172 2018-03-23 23:36:22 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
173 2018-03-23 23:36:01 "British" and "consistency" are like "water" and "oil": they just don't mix, no matter what you say or do! 
174 2018-03-23 23:35:55 Hi there! Finally went back to check. Here are two spots that need some clean-up:
1) Bloor St North side between Clinton and Manning is full of dirt/ rocks. 
2) Bloor St North side just east of Shaw is full of the sand they use to soak up oil from car crashes.
175 2018-03-23 23:35:25 home from work. about do this hot oil treatment on my hair #pooh
176 2018-03-23 23:35:24 I look for oil to at least check back to the 8-day EMA and likely 13-day. If it breaks that, the 34-day is strong support for now
177 2018-03-23 23:35:22 Didn't think Americans understood our humour
178 2018-03-23 23:35:08 The economy did not improve. The disaster was a result of a lack of oil drilling that sent prices to $150/bbl.

He raised food stamp use, crime, drug deaths, human trafficking, and spread disease with open borders.

0bama gave us Trump.
179 2018-03-23 23:35:06 Man who was going to be the leader in the treaty, putting extremist Islam in power instead of fundamental Islam. Then they found oil, which gave them billions of dollars, which they funneled into militants and al-queda and other terrorist groups
180 2018-03-23 23:34:54 LETS EDUCATE THE PEOPLE ABOUT A DIRTY HISTORY OF KKK AGENDA Business THATS MASS FUNDED BY UK USA Aust to watch, hack n steal OUR INFORMATION TO CONTROL us...Why? becoz they want our LANDS for Oil & Gas mining for profits! THIS IS WHY NATIONS ARE STARVED 2PAY THESE fraudsters!
181 2018-03-23 23:34:42 I use both butter and olive oil with pasta 
182 2018-03-23 23:34:13 Oil change 
183 2018-03-23 23:34:02 Yes, if you rub the kale with a little olive oil or other oil until it's softer and brighter/darker green, the flavour and texture are improved for eating raw. :D
184 2018-03-23 23:33:58 And please, don't put oil in the water too.
185 2018-03-23 23:33:51 I also never cook rib eye with butter or oil. No need. But I do crisp that extra fat sometimes and save it for other meals. That is if I don’t just eat it right away. Too delicious to toss
186 2018-03-23 23:33:44 I’m the best worst friend ever. I’ll forget your bday, razz you about all kinds of stuff, get you to stay out late, but will also change your brakes, oil, be late night taxi, and non-attorney-attorney.
187 2018-03-23 23:33:42 I got my oil changed faster than this line at the Liquor store – bij PA Wine & Spirits
188 2018-03-23 23:33:29 I own OILD and I’m underwater. Oil is inflated IMO. RSI is blown out and the Stochastics are turning down. I think it falls soon
189 2018-03-23 23:33:27 tried a new barber place today, having cut my hair and before trimming the beard, he applied some oil to my scalp and gave me me a head and neck massage which was so good I almost felt compelled to buy him dinner and meet his parents

192 2018-03-23 23:32:27 I substitute oil for apple sauce it seems to never fail and is nice if you wanna use less water for texture and/or if you are into adding stuff
193 2018-03-23 23:32:25 It's funny how coal, gas, oil and nuke people are ok with war, murder, catastrophic environmental damage, and nuke waste with a half life of 24,000 years! Then your all against distributed solar and onsite power storage via batteries. Your all smooth brained !
194 2018-03-23 23:32:18 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.

196 2018-03-23 23:32:01 Men are the second most commonly traded commodity in the world after oil.
197 2018-03-23 23:31:55 Saying BS to oil?
198 2018-03-23 23:31:53 In the last few months China has been allowed to feature crude oil futures n other words china is allowed to buy n sell oil n gas, russia is the biggest  producer thus Russia selling in yuan is a direct challange to both usa n Uk petrodollar/financial system. No wonder may is...
199 2018-03-23 23:31:53 おはたそーま
200 2018-03-23 23:31:52 i wanna be the agatha bean to someone’s chanel oberlin aka someone please dunk my head in boiling fry oil i’m over school
201 2018-03-23 23:31:42 @blueapron I should have known better... you don't cook chicken breasts with olive oil at medium high heat for 6-7 min per side. But still...
202 2018-03-23 23:31:37 This assumes the cost of ground transportation for people and goods stays flat or at least doesn’t rise. The laws of living in a finite world will remind people in the exurbs that nature still bats last. Fracking has covered up the peak oil crisis for the last ten years.
203 2018-03-23 23:31:34 have you seen the documentary “Time to Choose”? it’s quite good, covers Palm Oil the last 30 minutes of the film.
204 2018-03-23 23:31:28 There’s a medicinal marijuana oil program that’s legal for very limited diagnoses where I’m living now. I have 2 qualifying medical conditions but the program is expensive for patients & not covered under private or public health insurance.
205 2018-03-23 23:31:25 Colluding to make an oil monopoly with a 7th century Islamic dictatorship. Your liberal world order

207 2018-03-23 23:31:07 We will expand, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
208 2018-03-23 23:31:00 Nutritionist: tou should really try these products and eat more things with coconut oil
Me: What did I ever do to you? Why are you trying to kill me?
Her: Don't act like that.. I am just asking you to change your diet a little bit.
Me: I AM ALLERGIC TO COCONUT! No!!
209 2018-03-23 23:30:56 Damn Ranger has a nasty oil leak smh
210 2018-03-23 23:30:56 Because the Chinese release the gold backed petro-juan on Monday and the MIC wants the largest budget in human history to keep the enforcement arm of the federal reserve all around the world to keep oil artificially high to prop up the petro-dollar? IDK but thats my best guess.

214 2018-03-23 23:29:53 The environment wasn't why Obama dumped coal usage and oil production like he did...ANYTHING we do to lower our dependence on foreign (Saudi) oil, they will gut us with cost increases and production cuts before we can fully cut the apron strings(pipeline) to get off their tit...
215 2018-03-23 23:29:34 Sure, nothing to worry about- the neocons have such a great track record for bringing peace and order in the world.  And the oil will pay for it!
216 2018-03-23 23:29:02 I doubt they sold the land.  I'll bet they only sold mineral or oil and gas extraction leases. Companies don't usually want to own land. They just want right to rape it and leave it to the taxpayer to clean up the resulting mess.
217 2018-03-23 23:29:00 I agree no tankers and shut the oil off to BC .
218 2018-03-23 23:28:56 Which ignores the salient point: the Obama administration was hostile to offshore oil and gas development and actively sought to limit it.
219 2018-03-23 23:28:43 We are thankful you gave us a "Use by" date. Hopefully have that CAMBRIDGE, Erik prince, Putin, money laundering BANKERS, WALL STREET FAKERS, BIG PHARMA FAKE MEDICINE FOR MEDICAID DOLLARS, OIL BARONS WITH FAKE NUMBERS ON FED LEASES. DUMBOHEIGHTS CRYPTOCURRENCY MANIPULATION.
220 2018-03-23 23:28:30 ah. Really this one doesn't involve much either like 4 cups vegetable oil, and I am gonna cook like 3 different things with just that oil
221 2018-03-23 23:28:29 You hate jobs though. People with regular jobs don't give you millions like Wall Street, big pharma, coal, or oil. How are you a democrat again?
222 2018-03-23 23:28:24 I used bio oil, made no difference
223 2018-03-23 23:28:17 my mom is trying to give me olive oil to heal my throat send help
224 2018-03-23 23:27:56 But, you see, some of us know that @RealAlexJones would use such a law to sell desperate people Hipoppalorum, Lowpoppahiram, snake oil and platypus venom as miracle cure-alls. The law needs to be refined to say "except Alex Jones products."

You wanna pay me a tenner for making you a quality wig. 
Make sure you oil between your cornrows well when you wear them out because that wig isn’t resting on that scalp of yours.

231 2018-03-23 23:27:17 Apple cider vinegar, rose water, plenty of sleep and water. Also honey masks and tea tree oil
232 2018-03-23 23:27:13 Canada is dependent on oil and gas. The Canadian dollar is dependent on it. It is Canada's biggest resource. But there are many politicians that want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Anyways I'm done with dispelling NDP lies so have a good night.
233 2018-03-23 23:27:08 No/little oil in an air fryer.
234 2018-03-23 23:27:03 Must've been breaking the judges parameters and within the 5Metres.
Should all be in jail . Maybe learn about the many things humans make out of oil.
Probably even the gasoline you put in your car hypocrite!
235 2018-03-23 23:26:55 Bitcoin works fine, no need for fake snake oil garbage like Ethereum funded by banks and tyrants. Try using @CounterpartyXCP and Bitcoin instead of a fake Cryptocurrency that has no security and no use in the real world.

237 2018-03-23 23:26:42 I know! I just wonder how rich we need to be as a country to afford all this oil? #youyesyet #indyref2
238 2018-03-23 23:26:36 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealMikePompeo @USTreasury 
Why EEUU still buying oil from Maduro?
239 2018-03-23 23:26:26 i would say that seems like a safe place geographically but they're selling off the national parks and there must be oil under there somewhere
240 2018-03-23 23:26:19 cars are so expensive. Between my insurance and an oil change, I’m out $230. 
241 2018-03-23 23:26:19 You don’t let an oil mechanic make your pizza . You definitely shouldn’t eat the pizza   
242 2018-03-23 23:26:19 Coconut oil fixes everything.

248 2018-03-23 23:25:24 Ummm so the olive oil I usually buy just increased by a solid $8....#ChinaTariff
249 2018-03-23 23:25:23 But (like the tobacco companies before it), extracting and processing oil isn’t the problem, it’s burning it. You know, like how cigarettes aren’t the problem, it’s those people who lit ‘em on fire and inhaled.
250 2018-03-23 23:25:10 #StupidAnswers 
Extra atoms of this element are pumped into unsaturated oil to make hydrogenated fat
251 2018-03-23 23:25:04 So world oil prices are the govts problem?

253 2018-03-23 23:24:24 I have not tried that - it seems like it’s past the point of coconut oil. It’s blistering  likely from the antibiotics she was on.
254 2018-03-23 23:24:13 My brother said he trying to get some edge control for his hair. he think edge control is hair oil and he is trying to grow his hairline back. 
255 2018-03-23 23:24:07 My stomach automatically knows when something wasn’t cooked with olive oil. Vegetable oil is so fucking heavy, and ugh.
256 2018-03-23 23:23:54 I've never seen Elizabeth May standing outside Irving oil to protest foreign oil coming in by tanker. Or in Montreal to protest Denis coderre dumping shit in the river.

259 2018-03-23 23:23:09 Oh, I get it. Sorry. You are deeply concerned about oil splills that coul happen and hey understandable. 

The 42 billion liters of raw sewage BC pumps into the precious ocean yearly ... that a concern? That is actually happening. #BC shit & piss for the future! #liars
260 2018-03-23 23:23:05 Well, you're wrong on two counts there. IScotland will be in the EU if it wants to. And RUK will buy our stuff regardless. They're desperate for it. Unlike Scotland, England does not have enough energy, water, food or oil. Funny how WM is determined to cling onto us, eh?
261 2018-03-23 23:22:59 People wasting money on those miracle drops when simply rosemary oil and a carrier oil (jojoba or almond oil) is all you need to grow your hair.. your welcome.
262 2018-03-23 23:22:57 Y’all don’t know how much I love coconut oil. Shit is amazing for everything lol
263 2018-03-23 23:22:56 I also think most of the pie pieces are dependant on oil and gas
264 2018-03-23 23:22:51 So the new boo (aka oil bae) is seriously an expert at cuddling and affection. He’s changing my standards on that

271 2018-03-23 23:20:29 @CFOXvan News flash re: Kinder Morgan pipeline.  Gasoline for your car is made from petroleum products (i.e. oil).  So are all plastics, including your cell phone. That's why you and your listeners should care and educate yourselves.
272 2018-03-23 23:20:28 When a barrel of oil was around $100, the price of gas was less than it is now at $60. This is more about getting hosed than about pipelines. I would love to see BC government initiate a rebate incentive of about $5K to BC residents who buy an electric vehicle. @BCGreens @bcndp
273 2018-03-23 23:20:17 This was one of the first places I had ever been selling CBD oil legally in the city and they not taxing for it
274 2018-03-23 23:19:45 Ok lets drop oil and go back to the caveman erea...Are you idiot protesters aware of the utilities of oil or your just protesting for fun...Enough is enough...You can have your opinion...i respect that but show me how u can live without any products related to oil...stop it..
275 2018-03-23 23:19:35 In the last few months China has been allowed to feature crude oil futures in other words china is allowed to buy n sell oil n gas, russia is the biggest  producer thus Russia selling in yuan is a direct challange to both usa and Uk petrodollar/financial  system.

292 2018-03-23 23:17:23 Apreunna should be nice & come get my car for an oil change but she can’t drive so I’m good

302 2018-03-23 23:15:59 Nope. Just "sun"flower oil...
303 2018-03-23 23:15:56 I don’t think that was tanning oil at all....I seen the video
304 2018-03-23 23:15:51 Why aren’t we building refineries to handle the light crude? Why aren’t we setting up large trucks hauling our freight to run on natural gas? Interstate fueling stations could readily be retrofitted. NG needs no refining. Big Oil likes things just as they are. So do speculators.

307 2018-03-23 23:15:30 Can we spend 5$bucks on reestablishing natural farmer's,or fresh water lines installed upon our unshared planet of 3rd world area's.Can we spend a$1 on the Fukushima mess,or the garbage patch. Hows the oil leak in the Dakotas doing . pizza gate still open
308 2018-03-23 23:15:29 KM will drastically increase the presence of oil tankers in the Bay, thereby negatively impacting wildlife and the environment. With that forecasted volume, a major spill is inevitable and will be devastating.
309 2018-03-23 23:15:10 Hard to believe that the BP Oil disaster doesn't have something to do with this die-off in the Gulf. There must be some cumulative effects from the oil-related toxins. #KeepItInTheGround #ActOnClimate
310 2018-03-23 23:15:05 i told my mom i needed some essential oils , or some eucalyptus oil , she said “ay yo te compré olive oil , entonces allí tienes el oyó de tu culo “
311 2018-03-23 23:15:00 3 parts purified water, 1 part natural aloe vera gel, a tablespoon of witch hazel, and 3 drops of argan and/or shea oil. You can also add essential oils for a lil aromatherapy

314 2018-03-23 23:14:46 At alam na alam ni @srsasot ang grand eyeball. Sanay kase sya jan. May baon pa syang oil. Para sa lahat ng titira sa kanya.
315 2018-03-23 23:14:45 Listen to do me lmao this tea tastes just about to get castor oil for understanding we just thinking about government conspiracies
316 2018-03-23 23:14:37 What on earth is Perilla Oil? It’s in my seaweed snack.....I’m scared
317 2018-03-23 23:14:24 Im sure the suadis will be proud of u trump after bolton..bombs iran to keep oil well above 60.00..lol.. never been so blatant trump.
318 2018-03-23 23:14:05 It's not about our oil per se, but everyone else's oil.  E.g. If China can print CNY for oil, how many USTs do they need to hold?  (much less over time). Replay this worldwide, as US deficits are structurally rising and ask - who's gonna fund the US govt?

326 2018-03-23 23:12:44 ทำกูเสียใจบ่อยๆกูก็ถอยเป็นเหมือนกันนะ
327 2018-03-23 23:12:24 I found out 2 things my cooking self didn’t know today. 1: it makes a HUGE difference in fluffiness adding milk to your eggs for scrambled eggs. 2: Truffle/Truffle butter/oil is usually only a seasonal item.
328 2018-03-23 23:12:22 Use tea tree oil!! It works!!
329 2018-03-23 23:12:09 Bring back original recipe strips, the double down and bbq chicken. Bbq not that terrible oil soaked fake bbq that's out now.
330 2018-03-23 23:12:03 The funniest part of this pipeline story is that they negociated the lowest price (per barrel) to extract their oil & they would have sold that one at the highest price (per barrel) to their customers. Who do you think would have paid for the pipeline?
331 2018-03-23 23:12:00 Kurdistan citizens voted.for independence and legislators refused the referendum. Rich oil fields exist in Kurdish holdings.
332 2018-03-23 23:11:58 First: We're not financing either of those organizations. Second, the deal notes that once Iran followed a number of steps in the Vienna agreement re uranium, over $100 billion in frozen Iranian assets would be released(that's including oil embargoes & financial restrictions).
333 2018-03-23 23:11:51 i like the oil meme but it's kinda limited, i'm not sure you can do much to subvert the formula to make it last more than a week or so. I think we need more anti-american imperialism memes tho, where's the one about the cia overthrowing democratically elected socialists
334 2018-03-23 23:11:45 Better than stinking of hydraulic oil as I did today when a pipe burst over me..... 
335 2018-03-23 23:11:38 It's so beautiful, the colours and brushstrokes are perfect. Reminds me of @PaperPanther 's Bird And The Whale, it's a film done in oil paints and the sea colours and textures are just 
336 2018-03-23 23:11:34 I'm a retired Oklahoma educator - and the legislature is also raiding our pension funds to pay for the tax breaks for the oil industry!
337 2018-03-23 23:11:31 Ok, what asshole typed that in, and THEN hit enter?  Did you even read what you were saying?  So, our kids... are what, Third World Children now?  I bet if AR-15's were shooting up Oil refineries we'd fix the problem.
338 2018-03-23 23:11:15 Thinking about adding CBD infused argan oil to my skin care routine when my @LEVOoil arrives!!
339 2018-03-23 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: chewy crust with damp motor oil and ham.
340 2018-03-23 23:11:04 my car needs an oil change and idk what's going on up in my brain but i think some stuff needs changed there too
341 2018-03-23 23:11:03 I accidentally made like 7 appointments for an oil change bc I couldn’t figure the website out and now I’m getting a million reminders 
342 2018-03-23 23:11:02 1.3 trillion yet not one penny of his is used... immature species uses weaponry as communication skills or living skills. Use your own pathetic billions to kill other's over what, oil, religion, poppy fields, ect. False war's engineered to control us
343 2018-03-23 23:10:53 More pipelines to export filthy Albertan dilbit will not make an difference to the availability of gasoline in the Lower Mainland. Gas prices are determined and manipulated by the oil companies and seldom because of supply and demand.
344 2018-03-23 23:10:51 Jadeveon Clowney at Take 5 Oil Change appearance on Texans motivated for long term deal 'I want to be here, too. I'm looking forward to that Hopefully they lock me in and I'll be here forever. It would mean a lot, something I've always dreamed of I want to finish my career here'
345 2018-03-23 23:10:51 #Texans star Jadeveon Clowney, whiIe making appearance for Take 5 Oil Change, would like to land a long-term extension: "I want to be here.Hopefully they lock me in & I'll be here forever.

346 2018-03-23 23:10:31 I'll tell U what #Bolton means: #War #oil #weapons #Manufacturers into over-time, ...we might see #jobs but the result is killing people & ourselves in the process?! While #Halliburton & I dunno who else reaps $$ & #power...to what end?! #VoteThemAllOut
347 2018-03-23 23:10:30 @thatbitchsoft Hello what do you know about the CBD hemp oil and its benefits?
348 2018-03-23 23:10:19 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
349 2018-03-23 23:09:53 I’d love to have a body like that but the oil replenishment is too costly - ruins your togas too.
350 2018-03-23 23:09:32 Have you tried coconut oil?
Potato gets almost like a yeast infection sometimes and coconut oil shows progress after a day or two.
351 2018-03-23 23:09:28 めっっっっっちゃ寂しいです 物凄い喪失感……そうかこれが心にぽっかりと穴があいたということなのか…………
352 2018-03-23 23:09:26 Nope Nada Never Not me!!!
353 2018-03-23 23:09:19 not a toner exactly but if u use a drop or two of tea tree oil in ur face wash or moisturizer, its MIRACULOUS
354 2018-03-23 23:09:12 Don't forget to take it to Walmart.  You never know
355 2018-03-23 23:09:06 Mother Maria and oil kween Lesia T take out the Belorussian sisters.
356 2018-03-23 23:08:54 Alberta just had companies walk away and leave abandoned oil wells. BC is trying to collar a shipping company that spilled oil in English Bay and is scurrying around dodging lawsuit servers. This is what we can expect from companies. All promise, then run like hell.
357 2018-03-23 23:08:31 Some Nuln Oil would make her look so goooooood
358 2018-03-23 23:08:31 Fuck now I need a oil change
359 2018-03-23 23:08:29 Sauran fah?
360 2018-03-23 23:08:25 sniff some Olbas Oil n you’ll be sound
361 2018-03-23 23:08:19 Ladies. Idk who got y’all thinking coconut oil is a moisturizer but pleaseeee listen to me when i say IT IS NOT  It is a sealant meaning It holds the moisture that already exists in your skin. IT DOES NOT ADD MOISTURE 
362 2018-03-23 23:08:13 Yes stopping Canadian oil will definitely offset what China pumps into the air each year. You've saved the climate!!!!!
363 2018-03-23 23:08:07 Well there are thousands of Jewish members in the Labour Party in the Left. Many more than there are in the conservatives, Lib Dems and UKIP, so, er... you’re quite wrong.
364 2018-03-23 23:07:47 had no butter so i ate a sesame seed bagel w olive oil and let me tell u it was awesome
365 2018-03-23 23:07:44 Thereby decreasing the amount of oil tankers polluting your bays and shorelines, fewer tanker trucks clogging up the highways, fewer tanker cars freeing up space on trains for grain cars, and so on
366 2018-03-23 23:07:40 An unknown warrior walks into the shadow of the valley of death, sets sail for Mordor, captures the princess and takes the oil!!!
367 2018-03-23 23:07:38 Oohh No wonder.. But Nigeria is an oil rich  country, but your hair is oil free.. Be more of Nigerian as you said earlier.
368 2018-03-23 23:07:33 That's because we depend oil. This is the first gov that is trying to diversify
369 2018-03-23 23:07:31 Lol I got an oil change and handed the dude my keys to pull the car up and a minute later he just looks at me funny and is like “there’s a lot of weapons in your car” 
370 2018-03-23 23:07:31 Oil shoe m
371 2018-03-23 23:07:28 My favorite part about getting an oil change is saying no to all the extra things they offer
372 2018-03-23 23:07:12 Not enough oil?? Or water??
373 2018-03-23 23:07:06 Awful.  Backward, and contributing to problems that will dwarf anything we’ve seen yet.  Get off oil!
374 2018-03-23 23:07:02 I have a friend who was told by her vet that scenting both cats with the same smell can help...something safe, like a little rose oil DILUTED in canola oil...(NO straight essential oils...)...a drop or 2 rubbed on their shoulder blades...no personal experience, but it makes sense
375 2018-03-23 23:07:02 Peppermint oil a tiny dab on temples & in the soft area roof of your mouth can help them...hope you feel better soon!!

377 2018-03-23 23:06:54 今日私ベリアルしか言ってなくないか？？？？？？？？？
378 2018-03-23 23:06:52 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
379 2018-03-23 23:06:38 ( *´・ω)/(；д； )寂しいですね
380 2018-03-23 23:06:37 The BBC bias is now so obvious they don't even bother to hide it anymore. We r paying money to oil the Govt propaganda machine. #Newsnight
381 2018-03-23 23:06:35 And that applies in reverse to Norway. They never gave away control of their oil fields to (foreign) conglomerates. Effectively meaning that they were able to build a wealth fund that now controls over 4% of the world's capital on about 0.06% of world pop in 50 years.
382 2018-03-23 23:06:30 All it'll be is crushed cauliflower, beans, veggie oil and flour lol
383 2018-03-23 23:06:19 しんどい ベリアルロス
384 2018-03-23 23:06:16 My mum had the Trex cookery book too and she would make their Victoria Sandwich. The texture was dense but light. I think Trex is under rated these days because we feel guilty about the palm oil. Agree its good to use a ratio of Trex and butter in pastry.
385 2018-03-23 23:06:07 Give me oil in my lamp? 7 days of creation?? Hellooooooo
386 2018-03-23 23:06:03 That Oil is for Asia. Won’t benefit bc at all. Why would they want it?
387 2018-03-23 23:05:35 Succeeded in changing my oil, by myself, for the first time. Ergo also succeeded in starting my engine without replacing the filler cap. Ergo also succeeded in cleaning 3 quarts of spilled oil out of my engine bay
388 2018-03-23 23:05:33 Yeah because drilling for oil in rich fishing ground has NOTHING to do with fisheries!!
389 2018-03-23 23:05:27 The US is the #1 buyer of Venezuelan oil. And Venezuelan oil production is down by quite a bit since the start of their little socialist revolution. I'm pretty sure the US doesn't want Venezuela to collapse but instead to keep pumping oil, and more of it.

392 2018-03-23 23:04:54 PSA: CBD Oil is not bioavailable when just swallowed. It's meant to be absorbed under the tongue.

To fully absorb your CBD when ingesting it orally, it needs to be converted to a bioavailable form like our Water-Soluble CBD Powder.
393 2018-03-23 23:03:49 Especially with oil paints.
394 2018-03-23 23:03:34 Lmaoooo but what’s the fun in thattt?! . But tell me, how did you fry it dry like that with that little oil?
395 2018-03-23 23:03:11 Somehow every pot has oil in them so I'm boiling water in a frying pan. I'm that lazy right now
396 2018-03-23 23:03:05 Yes, lots of people did - sadly, USA, UK & elements of EU dithered for ages then weakly decided to take it to the UNSC for a mandate - where Russia (of course) vetoed it - then saw their opportunity & offered help to Assad in return for all his oil & rebuilding contracts...
397 2018-03-23 23:03:02 I’m using Josie Marian’s Argon Oil. It has made a huge difference. Use it straight out of the bottle, mix a few drops in your favorite lotion, or she has a body butter that is awesome! My skin has never looked better!
398 2018-03-23 23:03:01 Oil production is at record high levels. 

Guess you didn't know that.
399 2018-03-23 23:03:00 What are the statistics, enterprise wide, on the amount of oil based plastic waste your organization contributes to our environment.
You could easily use vegetable starch. This would be a massive impact on our environment.
400 2018-03-23 23:02:58 Well ag least he can negotiate contracts for oil royalties.....or not!
401 2018-03-23 23:02:50 If you didn’t already know rose water/lavender spray/coconut oil/ coconut water = LIFE

410 2018-03-23 23:01:20 I was supposed to go get an oil change today

ベリアルせんせー！！！！！！！！遊ぼうよーーーーーー！！！！！！！！
412 2018-03-23 23:01:12 Depended where you lived I suppose. Certainly wasn’t the mollycoddling of today; that would’ve been seen as bad parenting. Didn’t bother the doctors much either. Got a dose of cod liver oil daily (yuk) lots of exercise and plain food; loads of fruit & vegies.
413 2018-03-23 23:01:10 I have been sitting here waiting for an oil change for like 40 mins and turns out, i’m not even due for one yet.  so annoying .

416 2018-03-23 23:00:49 I need to stop procrastinating and get oil and grips for my quad...
417 2018-03-23 23:00:23 1 gallon of olive oil
418 2018-03-23 23:00:14 Hey @Valvoline - any affiliation with valvoline instant oil change shops?  Sitting in a bay where the technician is watching a utube video on how to fix the belts they installed 2 weeks ago.  Help!
419 2018-03-23 23:00:04 Hosea 2:8
Yet until now she has refused to acknowledge that I was the onewho gave her the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil; and that it was I who lavished on her the silver and gold – which they used in worshiping Baal!
420 2018-03-23 23:00:02 I am considering a MOUNDS of the Crackhouse Rag Prick based off the fact that the 800,000 tits DACA recipients man oil been blow job jizz by the Democrats (not odd mentioned in Bill) and the TETONS RAG, which is desperately cans for our Dirt Road Hairy Bag, is not buttermilk..
421 2018-03-23 22:59:31 Y’all ever tried bio oil?
422 2018-03-23 22:59:29 Verge has been promising "wraith" and not delivering because it's snake oil
423 2018-03-23 22:59:07 Indeed.
And ALL major oil firms agree.
Only a small group on internet obviously knows better.
I could use term "flat earth society". I am tempted.
"Sceptics" is truly a religion. It is not CO2. And if it were CO2 bit human. And if human small influence. And if influence positive
424 2018-03-23 22:59:04 First, that oil is not bitumen which sinks and can not be cleaned up. Second, that oil
Actually is for Bc to use and not for Asia to use with all the risk being taken by the pacific coast. . Not really complicated.
425 2018-03-23 22:58:57 Nah...my granny said drink this turmeric juice mixed with apple cider lemon water and brush ya teeth with castor oil and I'll be straight.

430 2018-03-23 22:57:43 My understanding is that Burnaby's hasn't. I hav read that Canada's environmental record is the best in the world. I wud welcome it being higher. I wud also welcome our insisting all countries w oil have as good or bettr. Plus our human rights & women rights record @BlairKing_ca?
431 2018-03-23 22:57:37 I Had To Give My Baby A Car Wash Now I Need An Oil Change
432 2018-03-23 22:57:28 When last she came back here though. We didn’t even know her until now and if she didn’t mention her nationality we would have never known. Right now these politicians studying oil they really don’t have time to honour ppl who didn’t contribute significantly
433 2018-03-23 22:57:25 Me: Drops frozen French fries into hot oil. Screams as oil splatters everywhere.
More French fries.
Screams.
This is how all the great chefs do it.

434 2018-03-23 22:57:00 Honestly if y’all going to tell me bout tea tree oil and witch hazel I’ll actually scream.

436 2018-03-23 22:56:37 I wish oil change wasn’t a thing
437 2018-03-23 22:56:24 A lot of that was a functional inevitability as Harper left office with a mess after investing every penny we made into oil sands and literally nothing else - main thing JT has done since getting in had been infra spending because low int%
438 2018-03-23 22:56:23 An oil drum for catching rainwater...Ack!  A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting!
439 2018-03-23 22:56:18 A law forcing these ppl to actually read thse bills and prove it before they can cast a vote would be good.
440 2018-03-23 22:56:14 Oil haters that can’t live without oil products.  Love the far left irony
441 2018-03-23 22:56:09 1 CUP OF OLIVE OIL?
442 2018-03-23 22:56:08 A Natural Gas Line, Sure.  But to pump oil to tankers going to California.  Pa-leaseee.  OMG
443 2018-03-23 22:56:04 My biggest concern is that a large portion of these snake oil sellers are willfully and knowingly deceiving millions and the ones who are closest to them theologically not only don't speak out against it but in many cases go to lengths to defend it.
444 2018-03-23 22:55:51 While whiny socialists go march on DC against #2A, my husband is working on a oil rig in ND blizzard so people have fuel for cars, homes and planes.  #MAGA #KAG
445 2018-03-23 22:55:27 Not encouraging my kids to take her example. There are better ways to make a point. Oh and let's look at all the oil products being used. Lol

449 2018-03-23 22:54:48 Yes, during a relapse. The only thing that helps is complete rest and deep breathing. Cannabis Oil has helped me. Hope you stabilize soon. x

459 2018-03-23 22:53:01 #Buckleup is the hallmark of snake oil salesman punting false hope. e.g. Counterchekist, garland & teapain.
460 2018-03-23 22:52:43 THE OIL INDUSTRY IS KILLING ALL NATURAL SPECIES INCLUDING THE PEOPLE THAT SHARE THIS NATURAL OCCURING ECO-SYSTEM. OIL IS NOT SYMPATHETIC TO THE NEEDS TO NATURE OR HUMANS ALIKE. LIKE A SERIAL KILLER IT ENLARGES ITS GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY CIRCULING ITS ORIGINAL KILL SIGHT.

465 2018-03-23 22:51:58 ドル円105円割れでクローズか、逆った。月曜朝いちで、ツッコミ売りでショート入らないと。株もダウンか、一旦戻ると思ったけど。予想外れ。oil/USD強いけどAUDは下げて終了か。
466 2018-03-23 22:51:57 There's one question I want ask you are American people if the wall does going you think it's going to stop drug lords how about transporting resources like oil gas we have to understand if someone steals the oil be transported into the u.s. do we have enough resource for oil
467 2018-03-23 22:51:53 @CBCNews why don’t you think #environment first instead of $$$ in your #Alberta pocket. similarities with #trump   Enough oil already, think #Canada first. We gotta go back to r roots & learn to survive with what We have. Don’t need 2 b rich, just survive

470 2018-03-23 22:50:59 Yes you need to put the fat in for at least 15 minutes but bacon fat smokes at a lower temp to olive oil. Trust me. Use the oil and you won’t have any issues
471 2018-03-23 22:50:42 So no more marches for DACA? Today its about NRA....whats next week, oil pipeline again... hmmmmm
472 2018-03-23 22:50:03 Once again Premier Nothead rises to the bait. Alberta is doing so well with oil revenues Wait, maybe Not
473 2018-03-23 22:50:02 can tea tree oil save your soul
474 2018-03-23 22:49:54 Doesn't change anything, @EdmOilKings need a house cleaning from top to bottom. Suspect another smoke screen to help hide how bad the Oil Kings Orginzation is. OEG the master of deception.
475 2018-03-23 22:49:53 Lol. No problem. Bacon fat would smoke. If you have guests just use olive oil.
476 2018-03-23 22:49:52 I can't imagine 16 and 17 year olds seeing Rex as an enticing example of what a university has to offer them. Unless Rex has changed his opinion on oil completely after realizing what Russia has planned for it he should go back to what he knows.

Adnan Al-Timimi, the president of Muqdadiya district council ,has revealed occurring of a fuel crisis in the district two weeks ago and so far without finding any solutions by the Ministry of Oil.
480 2018-03-23 22:49:14 If you're attempting to eliminate the demand for their primary product, how do you liquidate their assets? And who's going to be the purchaser? What use is a drill rig or a well if you're shutting down oil production? You're not making any sense.
481 2018-03-23 22:48:54 21世紀におけるデータは、 18世紀のオイルのようなもので、貴重なアセット。Deta is the digital oil.
482 2018-03-23 22:48:51 Trump’s master sure would enjoy the further boost a war with Iran would give to crude oil prices, which already are up 46% since election day.
483 2018-03-23 22:48:38 Maen bliar sih kl di tmpt ak artinya. baby oil?hm hm.. kutatau
484 2018-03-23 22:48:38 Even if oil production is at record high levels in Alberta (I don't know if this is true). The price of oil is much lower so lower revenue

492 2018-03-23 22:47:24 except one is literally oil off of a living creature and one is part of a plant. turmeric is also less expensive.
493 2018-03-23 22:46:58 Shame she can’t be bothered to protest all the oil tankers bringing in oil from Saudi Arabia.
494 2018-03-23 22:46:51 Fish oil!!
495 2018-03-23 22:46:51 Annointed: The oil represents the Holy Spirit. Thus set apart and empowered for a PARTICULAR work of God. God uses unusual people to do His will. Like the murderer and persecuter Paul, the murderer Moses, the small boy David against Goliath, Rehab the prostitute.Trump annointed!

509 2018-03-23 22:44:20 Beautiful work dad. Keep it up. It seems he may be catatonic and they need to find out why. Cannabis oil. Nothing to lose and everything to gain. CBD content not THC. Read up on it please!  I am a believer and only because of what I have seen and read.
510 2018-03-23 22:44:14 Because Cornyn ran a bogus smear campaign in 2012 against a viable challenger that low-info voters believed and Big Oil donates millions to his re-election campaigns.
511 2018-03-23 22:44:11 I actually watched a YouTube video about it earlier & I was thinking I would need a big cauldron of oil  but yeah, just like you said it was just an inch or so. It’s my weekend goal! thank you!

514 2018-03-23 22:43:57 We had more suffer than your fucking theater due to ISIS. You need ISIS to get control over  oil traffic and establish a puppet in order to apply pressure to Iran&Turkey,Not us.Did you find chemical weapons in Iraq ?How you feel about being Al qaeda founder?Stop ruining countries
515 2018-03-23 22:43:52 I think we are also talking about salt water, ocean water. So long as they tie oil tankers and oil spills to the pipeline extension...it will never be built. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #waterislife #vanpoli #StopKM

521 2018-03-23 22:42:33 Crude oil prices - the life blood of Putin's domain - are the highest they've been since Dec. '14, and 46% higher than on Election Day 2016. Now come the instability of trade wars and hot wars, pointing to still-higher oil prices.

524 2018-03-23 22:42:08 I'm betting that Tillerson will be even more happy he is out of that administration once the war(s) start. Whoever thought I would feel sympathy for an ultra-rich oil tycoon?
525 2018-03-23 22:42:07 What happens to the economy when the oil runs out?

528 2018-03-23 22:41:29 Today in California when forced to testify in court under oath, oil companies said that climate change is occurring due to higher levels of CO2 that result from human activity. Now their excuse is ‘It’s not all ours!’
529 2018-03-23 22:41:24 my mum was talking shit about this kid at her work for being allergic to apples. and then she got the results back for an intolerance test and turns out she’s allergic to cauliflower pine nuts and canola oil which is decidedly way more stupid so get fucked sharyn!
530 2018-03-23 22:41:21 You’re better at obscure social blogging than #OKleg is at selling us out to the Oil Overlords, and you look better doing it.. well I guess looking better than them isn’t so hard... ummmm you’re cooler than Ralph Shortey being questioned by the cops.. wait.. damn this is hard.
531 2018-03-23 22:41:17 Only thing with Donald Trump is after because he follows his Father's Footsteps his father is a oil that's where he got his wealth from and you think is going to love what he has done this whole father built on oil industry that's where he got his billions of dollars from

534 2018-03-23 22:41:04 Because conservatives are manufacturing it. 

Everything is fine. Oil production is at record high levels.

537 2018-03-23 22:40:28 Fish oil dawg
538 2018-03-23 22:40:26 Try ricinus oil.
539 2018-03-23 22:40:19 It has ZERO to do with peace or deterrence. Regime change for OIL and Resources is murderous
540 2018-03-23 22:40:18 Constitutionalist christian conservatives at it again. If you can’t win by telling the truth, all you have left is deceit. We are witnessing the death of the Conservative party. It’s now just a bunch of hucksters selling bibles and snake oil.
541 2018-03-23 22:40:14 Unfortunately, that was not in defense of U.S. it was a neo- con war for the oil industry. When you are in country; it then becomes survival until you can get out of area.

543 2018-03-23 22:40:04 You have been told correct. The CBD is legal in all 50 states. You can order it online or purchase it from a local retailer near you. Just google CBD oil & you will find many options. Amazon sells CBD oil & will direct ship to you. Lots of luck. I use a CBD salve that works.

I won’t be a consumer who stands by the use of any sort of palm oil / palm derivative

553 2018-03-23 22:39:15 It's almost like we don't have a National Energy Program like every other western nation & we just have to bare out whatever our majority foreign owned oil companies decide is in their best interest. 
554 2018-03-23 22:39:12 ISIS will take claim for anything tragic. My sink shot water at me while doing dishes yesterday, and they almost took claim. At the same time, the US heard my pants had oil on it. Almost tore em right off me!

557 2018-03-23 22:38:35 @farmermegzz @ipoliticsca  We need the pipeline for the benefit of Canada, the oil industry and agriculture.
558 2018-03-23 22:38:23 Is there really a need for Merchant Mariners?

My father was a Master Boatswain for the American Mail Line. Retired (Sailors Union of the Pacific-Seattle) in 1970.
Aside from Totem, and US Oil tanker companies,  are there any American flagged companies in trans-ocean service?
559 2018-03-23 22:38:17 If only they would all resign and we could bring in high school youth to run the state. Us old people have failed due to our prostitution to the oil companies and our greed.
560 2018-03-23 22:38:12 So are the drivers who make less than minimum wage after gas/oil.
561 2018-03-23 22:38:06 Perhaps when he told the intelligence agencies that maybe we'd get another chance to take Iraq's oil on his first day in office that should have been a clue.  Y'all were too busy responding to dog whistles.
562 2018-03-23 22:38:01 I think the rise in oil prices was part of calc to appt Bolton...oil money going up is good for all the oil oligarchs esp Russian & American ones. They too are Trump's base, much more important than the MAGAs cuz they hold the purse strings & will support Mueller firing.
563 2018-03-23 22:37:56 How is it effective in general, but not in more focused, targetted ways? Also, if we're calling political persuasion snake oil, we probably need to call out targeted advertising in general as snake oil?

565 2018-03-23 22:37:42 Accidentally bought oil paint and didn’t realize until I actually started painting.... guess it’s time to learn how to use oil lol
566 2018-03-23 22:37:40 I believe we're pretty much in tune here.

However, we're probably overstating the current role of renewable energy in the EU. What's really hurting Russia, the petroleum states in the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria, etc. is fracking. Some of those oil/gas economies (1/2)
567 2018-03-23 22:37:37 There's a course at the community college my sister is attending titled "World History from the Perspective of Oil" and now I really want to sit in on some of those lectures.
568 2018-03-23 22:37:35 No! I had this oil stain for over two months. Let the chalk set for 5 minutes and wash it like normal, you might have to repeat the process depending on the stain

579 2018-03-23 22:34:48 maybe spraying peroxide on top of the coconut oil wasn’t a good idea
580 2018-03-23 22:34:48 Mine are immune to coffee but I will try peppermint oil. Lol.  They have been evicted. Lol. 
581 2018-03-23 22:34:46 I don't usually talk about this but... I really excited about changing my vespa engine oil...
582 2018-03-23 22:34:40 @JustinTrudeau, you better not give into #DefendTheWater or else you are going to open up a short sell against our entire oil industry. 

You said it will get built, and it better. If not, you are just adding more economic uncertainty to a country with horrific debt levels.
583 2018-03-23 22:34:21 Coconut oil out here saving lives
584 2018-03-23 22:34:10 I hope it doesn’t come to this but maybe Alberta just needs to shut the oil off for a  month or so.
585 2018-03-23 22:34:04 And he later dumped her in a pot of boiling oil. One does not even wish to figure out if it was before or after he formulated the holy trinity before which no one believed in.

588 2018-03-23 22:33:24 Straight up!! I also just love CBD oil too.
589 2018-03-23 22:33:09 Nationalised industry. Putting self sufficiency for energy at the forefront. A self sufficient Green economy at the forefront of the economy would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Break our reliance on gas, oil and nuclear all UK owned with UK workers. That's to start.
590 2018-03-23 22:33:04 RT DHanscum: Steph_W90 Thanks, honey!  CBD oil is regulated around these parts.

595 2018-03-23 22:32:34 How can I move away from here without using oil to get there? #shill
596 2018-03-23 22:32:34 Similar to how several internal parts of airplane piston engines are made of slightly different alloys, so that spectroscopy on the oil/filter can tell which parts are starting to wear.

601 2018-03-23 22:32:06 Tunnel the water westward to the drought stricken states.  If we can move oil across the country, why not water?  Save lives & money on both ends

611 2018-03-23 22:30:13 I have lupus & admittedly must cost the NHS a fortune. I cant afford the oil as decent stuff is £40+, but I'm sure it would help my symptoms
612 2018-03-23 22:30:08 faith to Africa ends up in the hands of the rich who only pass on the dregs/out of date  supplies. This, despite the fact it is they who make these people poor. Unless there is oil to be found, Western govts apply no pressure for this to change. We let them off the hook (2/2)
613 2018-03-23 22:30:04 なんて呼べばいい?
614 2018-03-23 22:29:45 @MikeHudema if this kind of thing is acceptable I think I will go blockade Greenpeace offices, greenpeace money flow from the US oil Industry and the offices of @albertaNDP and @bcndp
615 2018-03-23 22:29:41 The models have always been pretty accurate, despite the oil financed propaganda to the contrary.  ...and now we are regularly seeing predictions come true. 
616 2018-03-23 22:29:36 Nah. That would be the Bushs. They waged war on the Middle East in an attempt to control their opium and oil. Their actions created the modern day “Islamic extremist”. Their actions are singularly responsible for every recruited terrorists who joins because “America is evil.”
617 2018-03-23 22:29:33 Thanks, honey!  CBD oil is regulated around these parts.

624 2018-03-23 22:28:09 @Walmart I just spent 1 hr 20 min waiting for an oil change on my Audi A4. THEY THEN TELL ME THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THE OIL CHANGE!!! They just realized they don’t have a tool to remove the oil plug.  No sincere apology/offering for wasting my time. Ridiculous + Disappointing.
625 2018-03-23 22:27:55 Finally, Ahidjo, with French aid, scrapped the federal system after oil deposits were discovered in #SouthernCameroons. I don't think @RoyalFamily & @10DowningStreet  would have "given" #SouthernCameroons to France via Ahidjo, had they known the area was oil-rich.
626 2018-03-23 22:27:45 @RRD_Davao operators, mechanics and drivers must do 360 inspections everyday that their transportation/vehicles will go out the garrage. Inspect tires, gas, oil, lights, brakes, emergency brakes, turn signals, mirrors. Make a law or EO#DU30 LAW INSTALL RECORDING DEVICE CCTV...
627 2018-03-23 22:27:38 I always cringe at that “you’re a hypocrite” criticism. The people concerned about global warming don’t expect to cut off all oil and gas right away. It’s about transitioning to a green future as soon as possible. More pipelines doesn’t do that.
628 2018-03-23 22:27:36 I agree. A few strategic trades by left wing big investors. My oil stocks are up 10%

645 2018-03-23 22:24:22 That said, lavender oil *did* seem to help somewhat. Behavior modification on our part helped most. When the aggressive behavior starts, we would immediately ignore the aggressor, to the point of moving to another room.

658 2018-03-23 22:22:37 Yeah we didn't respect that because we only got 23% the rest of it became transjordan because everybody was afraid of cutting off the Arab oil supply

660 2018-03-23 22:22:29 My daughter's night seizures would cause her to stop breathing and turn blue, so terrifying, nothing worked. 4 drops of CBD oil at night now and we all sleep peacefully for the last 2 years!
661 2018-03-23 22:22:28 I feel like a snake oil salesmen just duped us.
662 2018-03-23 22:22:22 Haha dry roasted just means I threw everything on some parchment paper on a roasting sheet and drizzled on no more oil than I can add in the time it takes to say EVOO. Then put it oven at 450°, which is pretty hot. How'd you make ratatouille if you don't cook?

He will have his investments and he will have as his targets oil fields he does NOT have a interest in.

671 2018-03-23 22:21:31 problem with this narrative is that it paint a perfect dual world where there are white and black. problem with wars, other than destruction, is that it is fueled by interest.

680 2018-03-23 22:20:15 It's so sad & sickening to see these women & children fleeing war & rubble. Meanwhile Oman-Qatar-Kuwait-UAE-Saudi - all oil rich Islamic countries have taken 0 refugees.

685 2018-03-23 22:18:45 I sweat fish oil at this rate
686 2018-03-23 22:18:34 You obviously don't care about the economy of BC or Alberta, or the tens of thousands of people who depend on the oil industry for their employment, both now and in the future.  You should resign.
687 2018-03-23 22:18:26 I'd recommend for you some lavender oil, Rosemary oil thyme oil for to help you with you're sinus trace. As many fresh herbs as possible.

694 2018-03-23 22:16:45 what makes an oil so essential. what brings the essential into the equation. i don't need any oils. oils are subpar
695 2018-03-23 22:16:43 As much of a POS,MORON,SNAKE oil salesman he is, this has been the most hilarious presidency to date,how could it not be we have an orangutan as POTUS.
696 2018-03-23 22:16:38 So how's this for a slap in the face my one-year-old van is leaking oil 6 days before we leave for Disney!!!
697 2018-03-23 22:16:35 We've always known @ElizabethMay is anti ethical oil and anti Canada. Canadian oil is Canada's life blood.

699 2018-03-23 22:16:25 I look forward to the day when the oil runs out and we no longer have to kiss the arses of the finest minds of the 9th Century.
700 2018-03-23 22:16:21 Well done because you guys are cowards to the oil industry instead of standing up for the people of Canada, good people have to stand in line and get arrested.
Well done, I hope that that transfers to votes against you next election
701 2018-03-23 22:16:13 @f1autocentres now my engine is leaking oil due to filter and seal not being put on correctly during service at Reading...
702 2018-03-23 22:16:02 If you've got oil, let's wrassle!
703 2018-03-23 22:15:57 Look into CBD Oil
704 2018-03-23 22:15:56 Bolton appointed, oil prices go up in fear of war in Iran. The oil oligarchs, tied to Trump & Putin, all benefit from this. Here is Trump throwing red meat to the 1% GOP Trump supporters, Putin allies, so that DJT can get support for firing Rosenstein & redirect Mueller probe.
705 2018-03-23 22:15:56 Nah it's not that mysterious. There will always be people that line up to buy snake oil.
706 2018-03-23 22:15:42 I don’t know what to say to that. We had a sharp decline in revenue from oil and job loss. Due to the price of oil dictated by Saudi Arabia. The deficit is projected lower every year to 2023. At that time with new revenue the gov should try to pay the debt /1
707 2018-03-23 22:15:30 Even in a post-apocalypse without oil or nations he needs a nationalized oil company to get a ride smh
708 2018-03-23 22:15:24 昨日のおかずは白いんげんのトマト煮。乾燥白隠元豆をふやかし、garlic, tomato, ginger powder, cumin powder, black pepper, onion, olive oil, saltと水を入れ、刻んだｺﾘｱﾝﾀﾞｰとパセリをふわっと入れて2時間くらい炊く。パンに付けるペーストとして食されるので、基本的に油と塩はキツい。

710 2018-03-23 22:15:07 @JustinTrudeau 

Future generations would look to you as a creature of greed and arrogance. So bathe in the dark poison you call money, if you believe it is not the destruction of our planet. Perhaps you will not be sick when the oil seeps into your bones...
711 2018-03-23 22:14:51 What's happening with BC gas prices is like Pablo Escobar in oil and gas; remembering psychopath, of course, falls on a spectrum.
712 2018-03-23 22:14:46 I got it taking more than the recommended dosage of mct oil
713 2018-03-23 22:14:42 Yet UK Gov( and Scottish Gov) very keen on maximum exploitation of  our high-carbon oil/ gas undersea reserves ?
714 2018-03-23 22:14:42 My eyebrows have been slathered in Castor Oil all day.  Can't wait for my next threading appointment in April
715 2018-03-23 22:14:13 I think so too!
We keep using oil 10 days.
It is an owner’s order.
No choice 
716 2018-03-23 22:14:09 Ayyy is this the twist one? I have the same base. But yeah fw the oil shits 
717 2018-03-23 22:14:08 I drizzle just a tiny bit of oil on chx & veggies, then season with salt and pepper and fennel seed, which seems to be a good choice for mostly dry roasted stuff.
718 2018-03-23 22:14:00 @RadioPaparazi @Sean_RMW @omaakatugba  am coming with fuel and engine oil tomorrow. @Sean_RMW  i need ur car keys. Be a gentle man and hand it over. Up eagles.
719 2018-03-23 22:13:58 It's strange that some men will drink and eat anything put before them, but check very carefully the oil put in their car.

722 2018-03-23 22:13:33 May pabrika ng langis tong fezlak ko... kaya gusto ko all natural and pure oil ang gamit 
723 2018-03-23 22:13:28 Do you have Mobil 5w-20 oil?
724 2018-03-23 22:13:24 at least with sedation, you are asleep soon after you get there. Try coconut oil too, it might help stop infection
725 2018-03-23 22:12:57 Yeah oil is leaking, the seal in my trunk has faded so I can't use my trunk, speed sensor is fucked up. I just wanna save a lot so I can do a solid down payment
726 2018-03-23 22:12:46 Only thing I put on my salad is some olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and, occasionally, squeeze some lemon on it
727 2018-03-23 22:12:45 One of the things Trump wanted for avoiding a trade war was for the EU to block Russia's oil/gas pipeline project. I think they accepted the deal. #BBCNews
728 2018-03-23 22:12:39 Don't wait for this minder to come on!  Your oil is black as coal by this point & has lost much of it's viscosity.  The black is from the carbon inherent to combustion engines.  Not good!  I stick w/ the old rule of every 3 months or 3k miles despite the claims of most OEMs make.
729 2018-03-23 22:12:36 And even all major oil firms are acknowledging this.
Only on internet some disperse small anti-science groups are still not convinced.
And please don't come up with Galileo.
730 2018-03-23 22:12:32 Enbridge already allowed the nation’s largest land-based oil spill in the Kalamazoo River in 2010 due to an old pipeline, we cannot let this happen again on an even larger scale #NoMoreLine5
731 2018-03-23 22:12:21 Ah ah not cooking oil on my body!!
732 2018-03-23 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective

734 2018-03-23 22:11:51 my brother just asked if he could put coconut oil on his bagel instead of butter
735 2018-03-23 22:11:42 My mother is a saint. She took my car to get the oil changed, got it washed, put gas in it, and brought me dinner home for work. I don’t deserve this woman. 
736 2018-03-23 22:11:39 This account is dedicated to the replacement of Line 5 oil pipeline by sharing good memories from the Great Lakes that should continue to occur for future generations. Have a story? please share by tweeting with #NoMoreLine5 or DMing it to this account to tweet anonymously
737 2018-03-23 22:11:36 My neighbour repairs cars and he stupidly has an open barrell of oil in his garden, I'm not sure but I think he may have slightly fell into it after walking on the side.
738 2018-03-23 22:11:26 That's why now Libya is a stateless country we went over took all the resources and immigration are crossing Mediterranean Sea to get to Europe because Gadafi is not there to prevent it. What was Britain and US interests there other than oil.Keep your facts straight bf quoting me
739 2018-03-23 22:11:26 Such people never seem to come up with any facts or counter evidence. In my experience they are often connected to the oil industry, suggesting that the motivation is vested financial interest.
740 2018-03-23 22:11:23 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.
741 2018-03-23 22:11:19 I’ll respectfully disagree. I wish you well though. I need oil to crash ASAP.
742 2018-03-23 22:11:18 Wow! I had no idea there were so many Gaels in the IR tribe! Should we do the Oil Thigh @isanet ?? 
743 2018-03-23 22:11:11 End of first oil kings leading chiefs 2-1
744 2018-03-23 22:11:09 So for several weeks I have been like "HM why does this tub of coconut oil leave me covered in powder, why is it so sweet, what is?" Today I noticed it just says "whole coconut" . It is just pureed coconut. I just rubbed like a cup into my hair.
745 2018-03-23 22:10:53 あーりおはgarlic、おーりおはoilだよ

746 2018-03-23 22:10:30 Exploration isn't carried out within existing oil fields, unless you refer to deeper reservoir targets. @BloombergNRG @soyfervlad
747 2018-03-23 22:10:27 The tea tree will kill you then maybe add lavender or peppermint oil
748 2018-03-23 22:10:24 OMG how long does it take to change my oil 
749 2018-03-23 22:10:16 You have to find a doc who recommends a specific brand/company and has actually tried it, otherwise you’re just buying Gucci lavender oil. $$$
750 2018-03-23 22:10:14 Ah lads I was handed a note from a stranger today whilst volunteering for #DaffodilDay ‘cannibas oil, Rick Simpson, run from the cure’. Yea I know! #BCCIRE #cancer
751 2018-03-23 22:10:14 TRAFFIC: Earlier oil spill blocking intersections of Lem Turner Rd/Oakhurst Ave, Edgewood Ave/Smyrna St, Lem Turner Rd/Lake Forest Blvd, Edgewood Ave/Wainwright Ct until 11 pm tonight - per JSO. #WOKVtraffic

I think that Albertans need to realise that without a sales tax and with lower oil revenues that they will have a deficit or face severe cuts in services regardless of which party is in power.

754 2018-03-23 22:09:56 Because like other assets in a credit contraction oil and gold will be hammered after China gets done with their Ponzi futures contract launch
755 2018-03-23 22:09:39 If trump has his way these parks & their views won't be around much longer. Oil drilling, raping the land for profit - the republican way
756 2018-03-23 22:09:27 I think I need to start keeping track of all the rising prices/other taxes since the #GOPTaxScam went into affect. How many ways am I being screwed by the top 1%?  #1) In my state, gas prices have risen $.27 per gallon since this time last year (and crude oil is not to blame)
757 2018-03-23 22:09:12 Just put essential oil on my armpits bc I forgot deodorant like a goddamn idiot

768 2018-03-23 22:06:25 I believe Christy Clark's GOP (Gas&Oil) &foreign donor & flipping #Vanre Real estate party aka BCLiberals based their budget on projected gazillions of dollars rather than reality. ie BS. #pnpcbc #bcpoli
769 2018-03-23 22:05:55 The girl at delta sonic who always takes care of me when I’m getting an oil change is truly one of the nicest people I’ve ever met
770 2018-03-23 22:05:55 mushroom and sun dried tomatoes bc the oil rly adds to it when ur not getting any fat from a meat, esp if ur using a non dairy cream. OH i have a rly bomb recipe for a pasta w zucchini and mushrooms that’s super savoury and delish while being rly light (it has soy and lime iirc)
771 2018-03-23 22:05:38 fun fact:  some of the bigger oil reservoirs in CA come from diatomite, where tiny sea creatures died then sediment was deposited on top of them, back when most of CA was under water.  When you produce the oil, you're also pumping out seawater that's 100s of millions of years old
772 2018-03-23 22:05:32 Well, actually, cod liver oil is pretty good for your health! It does work miracles! 
773 2018-03-23 22:05:18 I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.

790 2018-03-23 22:03:30 Better load up on Popcorn this is getting good. I am all for electric cars to help with oil and gas  usage. The problem is twice as much  for the car at less than half the mileage is not a good deal.

815 2018-03-23 22:00:17 #FinanceTipFriday sometimes you can buy parts at autozone and take them to an oil shop for simple repairs. In doing this, you save the markup cost on the part and you pay the oil techs salary vs a certified mechanic salary.
816 2018-03-23 22:00:16 Gist me
817 2018-03-23 22:00:15 when im out of school i want to do more speedpaints and work on artistic techniques n stuff. ive fallen in love with oil painting, character design, and atypical stylistic choices. i feel like a fresh artist and i'll be free from my academic shackles soon lol
818 2018-03-23 22:00:08 It's certainly achievable. Just not workable for the oil companies.

827 2018-03-23 21:59:10 Every time I have to sit and wait for my oil change (or anything car related) to get done, I swear I age at least 5 years. 
828 2018-03-23 21:58:59 Anybody call American embassies about becoming the largest oil producer and consumers of same in the world?  Didn’t think so.
829 2018-03-23 21:58:52 Check the manual for how to check your oil levels. If the oil isn't golden-ish in color, they didn't change your oil.
830 2018-03-23 21:58:38 Porque no espropian a oil y la pasan para ypf me parese no

833 2018-03-23 21:58:25 buy a bunch of ingredients. taste some, throw some in a pan with oil and see what happens. throw it in the oven for a bit and voila, you've just learned how to cook charcoal
834 2018-03-23 21:58:22 ???
835 2018-03-23 21:58:17 We'll be paying a hell of a lot steeper price when the inevitable oil spill happens.
836 2018-03-23 21:58:03 good point! oil as loosely fitting metaphor not analogy, in this context pointing at the rise of the tech barons and association w/ immoral business & politics… and how data needs processing just as oil needs refining before its true value can be unlocked...
837 2018-03-23 21:57:57 Haha Abdul.... I don't have to complete it
838 2018-03-23 21:57:14 Poor car, it should get extra oil just for having to pose with him.
839 2018-03-23 21:57:03 I'm 100% certain you'd be right. Mad how all the no marks that support oil money clubs try to create a rivalry with us, as if it would somehow validate them.
840 2018-03-23 21:56:57 You had a chance for energy east but you let Junior sabotage it now your stuck with over priced ISIS oil
841 2018-03-23 21:56:49 And I’m rubbing yer breests with oil
842 2018-03-23 21:56:48 When you get your oil changed, how do you know that they actually changed your oil? Asking for a friend. A friend who looks a lot like me.
843 2018-03-23 21:56:40 Lil tip: if you have a pimple you absolutely can't pop put some tea tree oil on that sucker and leave it over night  if it doesn't work completely one more time should be enough
844 2018-03-23 21:56:35 My co-workers are amazed that my other co-worker changes his own oil

853 2018-03-23 21:55:27 I've got no problem with hunting Daesh / ISIS because they are horrible. But yes we should not forget who caused them to be created and who eventually even benefit from their existence. Cheap oil and resources, Rockefeller said it. Buy when blood flows through the streets.
854 2018-03-23 21:54:57 Public opinion

Keep DACA, DACA revoked
Leave our National Parks alone, sold to big oil
Keep our land, air and water clean, roll back protections

They want opinion?
855 2018-03-23 21:54:45 He is not. He is an snake oil salesman. His companies would fail without tax breaks. He does whats best for him not the world. He sends weapons into space. He attacks companies who speak bad about him, and his workers die and get injured because of him.
856 2018-03-23 21:54:39 I’m not argumentative at all, I just answered your question, you however are the one who chooses to harp on about this, despite admittedly knowing it’s something I said I don’t like. Plenty of girls use oil, just enjoy them
857 2018-03-23 21:53:58 so that explains why Bibi is going after leviathan oil pipeline. hmmm seems zionism only believes in

usury
deception
terrorism
dehumanization
murder
harassment
humiliation
breaking international law
apartheid
and false propaganda 

and still we rise! #BDS

864 2018-03-23 21:52:50 Today video games tomorrow it's the oil industry!
865 2018-03-23 21:52:36 China didn’t kill the petroUSD. Congress did. They let the US companies sell their oil outside the US. Which means China is buying oil from the US too. KSA and the US are allies still. China may need to reconsider b/c they need more than Russian oil for supply
866 2018-03-23 21:52:19 3 u r shoveling a lot of bull crap with that Keystone pipeline claim. We aren't making the steel and when pipeline is done, it will only employ 300 some full tome workers. And who has dibs on that oil. Not the USA
867 2018-03-23 21:52:14 It's just a little island, got no oil left, not much gold, too many people. Who would want to invade?

872 2018-03-23 21:51:43 Stop oil and start renewables - it's simple and doable. Only greed is in the way of real progress on the issue of climate change.
873 2018-03-23 21:51:29 I mean if you consider being in a family with 50 million plus from real estate and Texas oil as being broke then I guess so

875 2018-03-23 21:51:19 Tell your son: Today, US only imports about 20% of its oil; much less than many other nations.
China it's over 60%.
Europe is over 70%.
Japan is 100%.
On current trends US cd be 100% oil independent in another 3 years or so - by early 2020s.
After that US cd become net exporter.

905 2018-03-23 21:46:02 I agree in the sense of scam as a verb.  However in the sense of lacking validity, they are scams. The salesmen really do believe in the snake oil, but it is snake oil nonetheless.

957 2018-03-23 21:38:27 The majority appears to be happy importing ~675,000 barrels of oil per day on tankers from foreign countries than sending our own natural resource through pipelines supporting our own country and boosting Canada’s economy on both coasts. #knowyourfacts #tankersvspipeline

959 2018-03-23 21:38:26 Israel is the instigator in all of this.  They helped create and fund ISIS to gut Syria and steal its oil.  Blatant deception and evil by anyone's definition but theirs.  Israel has no conscience when it comes to dirty tricks.  They will use any means to get their way.

965 2018-03-23 21:37:58 I would think a pipeline is far safer than sending oil by rail... I seem to remember an incident in your country when a whole town was almost wiped out by a rail derailment . You Canadians seem to be concerned about things that don't make economic sense.

970 2018-03-23 21:37:18 My point is that Canadian oil is more environmentally and ethically responsible than any other.  So Canadians and the world should benefit from this.
971 2018-03-23 21:37:10 Oil is sold in dollars!   As Stirling has not recovered to pre-referendum prices, it is costing far more than it needs to cost.

995 2018-03-23 21:32:20 Yeah you just go through the drive though and ask for a “huge oil change and side of cheddar rounds” 
996 2018-03-23 21:32:18 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
997 2018-03-23 21:31:59 True... but I’m not saying on normal babestation just get covered in oil then expect us to call I’ve always asked would you not use oil if say for example I call and ask you to... then I’m paying so similar 
998 2018-03-23 21:31:50 And that is precisely the point. Plants will take care of themselves but not necessarily like you want them to. But the rest like polluted water, oil spills, mine tailings & stuff stay for generations unless people commit & actually do something. Extinct animals do not regenerate
999 2018-03-23 21:31:50 Without the oil sands & a tide water pipeline,Alberta will never get out of debt. The West is doing fine,no problem.

1002 2018-03-23 21:31:38 If they WERE that, then I'd question people's priorities. Idk, banks making people homeless, oil tycoons destroying the land......vs a GAME company....TOUGH CHOICE.

1005 2018-03-23 21:31:15 Most likely fakes generated by the IDF in exchange for cheap ISIS Oil.
1006 2018-03-23 21:31:10 well i did. "safe as technology could imagine," huh? that's a goofy thing to say, considering the amount of oil that keeps getting dumped by all these "safe" technologies. both sides need to see all the facts and compromise. M/Earth has no bias. Remember & Stop poking the bear
1007 2018-03-23 21:31:00 Indeed, we must press hard for an end to oil & gas exploration.
1008 2018-03-23 21:30:59 Coconut oil.  Get it at the grocery store.
1009 2018-03-23 21:30:59 I’m hoping I don’t end up crawling out of Lucas Oil tomorrow night 
1010 2018-03-23 21:30:43 I just really like oil down , but I also have a pool 
1011 2018-03-23 21:30:37 So the king on his head like the horn of oil for a meat offering.
1012 2018-03-23 21:30:34 Oh that’s good. If we go take some oil, we could sell it to make a few bucks
1013 2018-03-23 21:30:20 I kind of miss the old days...it was just black oil and super soldiers, and now we have to deal with all this other stuff. 
1014 2018-03-23 21:30:19 we would love to meet you God willing.

Not interested in your snake oil.
But have a nice life & God bless.
1018 2018-03-23 21:29:52 Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't these revenues she's referring to be private? I hope she doesn't mean that she expects the current oil companies will be the ones investing. And people call progressives unrealistic.
1019 2018-03-23 21:29:50 Oil change ran me $77. Take me to the cross because these burdens.

1022 2018-03-23 21:29:41 She won’t. Her country heavily relies on Russian gas and oil!
1023 2018-03-23 21:29:16 Digging so deep I'm about to find oil.
1024 2018-03-23 21:29:08 that was just a mustard and a type of oil. Even if it's just for myself,I like to layout the plate nicely.
1025 2018-03-23 21:29:02 Also most of the world's oil comes from the End-Permian extinction where the Earth's ocean heated up to 100 degrees causing ocean anoxia, which lead to hypercanes (hugely massive hurricanes) of hydrogen sulfate. Climate change can get scary.

1027 2018-03-23 21:28:59 Oh one more point for you to ponder, was it the Brexit vote that put up oil prices ? thus putting the cost up of fuel to deliver to your local Lidl, or dont that bit figure in your mantra? best have a word with OPEC.

1032 2018-03-23 21:28:33 basic plot: norwegian govt decides to stop producing oil and go carbon neutral, so russia invades to get the oil supply back
1033 2018-03-23 21:28:32 You called it perfect last week. Look at xle and xop both ended negative today, not to mention the Canadian oil index was negative. They don't buy this rally at all.

1038 2018-03-23 21:27:42 Well it’s an oil.
1039 2018-03-23 21:27:40 WHY IN THE HELL are we paying for a wall for a country that is FILTHY OIL RICH:  This freaking sucks and WE THE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY FED UP with Congress' shenanigans and their    playing with American citizens' lives while they live in behind HIGH WALLS protected by ARMED security

uhh-
"And here's our infinite universe of segerated bathrooms"
1041 2018-03-23 21:27:28 Also we will be #1 exporter of oil in a few years. That should bring down budget also.
1042 2018-03-23 21:27:27 this is why i'm calling it a psyop, a fable, etc - look at us here, debating hypotheticals... what factual information do we actually have about the petro? i see very little, but I recognize this pattern, lack of facts and technical details, from all the blockchain snake oil
1043 2018-03-23 21:27:26 Annihilation is trippy as fuck with those oil film colours and shifting perspectives. Like another take on heart of darkness.
1044 2018-03-23 21:27:21 Yes it's like flavored oil or something idk it just took a while to cook lol me and joe were disappointed I'd rather pay to get my steak cooked by a professional  do the cheese and desert tho!!! By the time I got desert I didn't even wanna eat anymore lol
1045 2018-03-23 21:27:07 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade and that you always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down (gravity will pull the product's moisture back up to the top surface).
1046 2018-03-23 21:26:44 Been waiting on the oil since yesterday he finally text me and I’m sleep
1047 2018-03-23 21:26:24 Hash Oil!
1048 2018-03-23 21:26:17 i've spent a lot of money on luxury and drugstore skincare products for my difficult skin and i LOOOOVE @yestocarrots miracle oil primrose mask. i wish it came in a full size instead of just single use! it's the only thing that has helped chill out my redness 
1049 2018-03-23 21:26:17 Transitioning away from fossil fuels. It's the only solution that is good for BC and in the medium- & long-term. I didn't say completely abandon fossil fuels--I consume the products they provide. A gradual process of wresting power and subsidies away from big oil is the solution.
1050 2018-03-23 21:26:16 What!? U arnt even Canadian?? Where does the UK ger their oil from? Mother Russia! Haha.  My goodness.  Worry about your own country please,  it has enough of its own problems at the moment!
1051 2018-03-23 21:25:55 Hey @ hot army guys there's oil in my butt
1052 2018-03-23 21:25:44 Hope @RobnCaz @HenryWhitfield @mattfarrell08 @mascordbrownz and all other @TOwolfpack fans get out of Crown Oil Stadium without issue after that call by the ref. #RunWithThePack
1053 2018-03-23 21:25:34 Okay am I a stupid Bitch or does it really take quicklube to do an oil change in 5 hours?! Bc god damn
1054 2018-03-23 21:25:06 right?! it's like oh wow, thank you SO much, i would never have realised essential oils would cure me, you have done me SUCH a favour by letting me know. Off to buy some lavender oil RIGHT NOW
1055 2018-03-23 21:25:00 Any concern with those LNG tankers?  How about the trains that bring oil into BC?  Don't see any one protesting those.
1056 2018-03-23 21:24:56 They're not protesting the pipeline and tankers feeding US oil (kerosene) to Vancouver Airport, are they? How can you people be so ignorant?
1057 2018-03-23 21:24:51 I have so many questions for you since I’m going through skincare training at my job and I asked about scrubs and coconut oil and other alternatives but I still want your feedback on what I was told.

1059 2018-03-23 21:24:37 So with that out the way, we can do much more with the $ earned through  the Canadian oil and gas industry to tackle global climate change.  Think electric cars (they cost a lot!), efficiency programs, reforestation programs (CO2 sinks), eco renovations, etc etc
1060 2018-03-23 21:24:35 Caption: pics I snapped out the window as my flight was landing in New Orleans last week.

1079 2018-03-23 21:21:45 I hear you about climate change, but climate change is cumulative. Fact time: Canadian oil represents a very small fraction.  Oil/gas account for ~20% total GHG in Canada.  Canada accounts for ~1.6% of global emissions.  So our oil represents  ~0.32%  of global GHG emissions.

1083 2018-03-23 21:21:10 The Rockefellers happen to be one of the biggest opponents of ANY oil production now. They’ve completely divested. You seriously need to update your view.

1089 2018-03-23 21:20:03 Oslo is way more expensive than Stockholm - dat oil inflation. And even a tourist with no clue would struggle to pay more than $10 in Stockholm for beer.

1115 2018-03-23 21:16:19 If overseas markets want our oil they are willing to pay the $61/brl USD current price. The American oil interests are buying for about $30 less. But without a pipeline to a coast, Canadians have only one customer. The USA. Just the way the Rockefeller's (Standard Oil) want it.

1127 2018-03-23 21:15:15 Oh yea, that is total bullshit. The oil companies whole business is based on digging up extinct fossils and burning them, so they know exactly how the carbon got in the atmosphere.
1128 2018-03-23 21:15:12 Because one car causes a lot less pollution than a giant fucking oil company that can’t seem to keep oil where it’s supposed to be. 

Fuck off with this shit, not only is it wrong its embarrassing.
1129 2018-03-23 21:14:45 Businessman my butt is a snake oil salesman. And a very good con.

1132 2018-03-23 21:14:34 I had $15 this past weekend in hopes that t would help you get some sprays or material for a DIY spray trap.  Sugar water and peppermint oil are said to work really well against wasps.

But a standard can is about $2-10 at Walmart, depending on the brand name and size.

1147 2018-03-23 21:12:15 They don't work with "sense".They are hypocrites and complete idealogues.Willing to consume oil arriving in oil tankers from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela but not Canada.

1151 2018-03-23 21:11:55 @CashErrthing  just saw the USO post, very interesting... have a good weekend!

1156 2018-03-23 21:11:23 Meanwhile in Colombia oil flows on water sources of the Lizama pipe since March 2nd, until today 23 thousand barrels have been spilled. This is what FRACKING produces, the economic policy of the candidate for the presidency @IvanDuque y @German_Vargas. sad really @Tanja_FARC
1157 2018-03-23 21:11:20 Using oil for production isn’t the same as burning it for fuel, which is the intended purpose of this diluted bitumen.
1158 2018-03-23 21:11:14 Each is as bad as the other as targets go. Iran and Russia v close (signed Nuc power deal recently). Also, Iran sells $$$ oil into China. I wouldn't fuck with them.

1169 2018-03-23 21:10:04 I will remember not to romanticize abandoned oil rigs.
1170 2018-03-23 21:10:03 I've attempted low fat low carb but seem to feel compelled to drizzle olive oil on tuna for example. For me there seems to be a dietary fat level that I can live with. Also I'm experimenting with getting more protein from whole eggs as have some current problems with dairy.
1171 2018-03-23 21:09:55 I need more almond oil. Like asap

1174 2018-03-23 21:09:44 When I was doing a lot of welding in oil refineries, we had to wear Nomex coveralls alllll the time we were working. They still catch on fire, it just goes out sooner.

1178 2018-03-23 21:09:25 Mashed with loads of butter, I presume. Although there’s a luxurious version with olive oil and double cream.
1179 2018-03-23 21:09:20 I prefer unscented oil, myself
1180 2018-03-23 21:09:09 3 tablespoon cocoa, 3 tblsp sugar, 3 tblsp rising flower and mix those in ur mug
Then 3 tblsp milk, 3tblsp oil And 1 egg and mix those in very well till it's smooth
Then put it in the microwave for 1 minute!
1181 2018-03-23 21:09:07 What oil can do for a country
1182 2018-03-23 21:09:00 Why are you people soaking plantain in oil like that? 
1183 2018-03-23 21:08:51 People will ask for a Cake. But if you give them Eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan and oven, they get frustrated an leave the kitchen.
1184 2018-03-23 21:08:47 I always provide a full body massage with warm coconut oil. Helps the both of us to relax & accentuate the erotic into the session

1187 2018-03-23 21:08:38 You will never have the respect of citizens. You sold their lands to drill.oil, and won't even employ your constituents. You are derelict in your duties and oath to the constitution. You are a failure.

1190 2018-03-23 21:08:31 Before the massively popular revolution on 1979 which turned the tables on the Shah's autocratic regime, installed and supported by western oil interests, where political opposition was ruthlessly suppressed. Just saying.

Kale is very good. Very good de tox
1194 2018-03-23 21:08:08 1) Alberta population grew vastly in excess of our infrastructure for 15 years 
2) Klein had higher tax rates, and royalty values from higher resource prices to his advantage - both oil & NG are in the toilet these days.

1199 2018-03-23 21:07:44 We have refineries where the oil is drilled. These pipelines are to send the oil to market.
1200 2018-03-23 21:07:30 The raw materials are the developers who contribute their time to writing FOSS. The clients are the users of FOSS for whom the upfront cost is zero. Money is made when FOSS needs to be supported. Get the car for free but oil changes are $1000. This model always fascinated me.
1201 2018-03-23 21:07:29 Jason could hear the sound of chastising in her voice, as he turned around on the couch, so that he could look up at her. Hopefully the oil wouldn't totally destroy the couch.

He raised his hand to reach her forearm, rubbing it up +

1205 2018-03-23 21:07:09 I'm not a fan of pipelines but in order to make changes & fund technologies that move beyond oil, we need that money in the ground. A massive change in thinking & progress does not happen overnight. The Industrial Revolution took 80 plus yrs. I think we are moving faster now.
1206 2018-03-23 21:07:00 Recovery and mobility should allow you to get more strength work, not overshadow it. I see a ton of emphasis with recovery and mobility at the expense of strength work. As @ericcressey says "Don't spend too much time changing the oil on a car with no engine."

1208 2018-03-23 21:06:54 He'll happily let the US/Israel bomb Iran, while arming Iran himself. More conflict is good for him - higher oil prices and higher demand for Russian weapons.
1209 2018-03-23 21:06:45 Nothing but a publicity stunt, ask her why she is siding the US interests to land lock our oil over the interests of CDN jobs, additional royalties that benefit all CDN’s.
1210 2018-03-23 21:06:42 Shark oil is this woman answer fah everything.  Never call old peeps when yah sick
1211 2018-03-23 21:06:26 Oil runs the world. Probably for about another 50 years or so. Transition will time for new technologies to develop. Oil isn't going. Look around at all of the things possible because of the development of plastics & synthetics. That's all oil.

America will be EVERYONE'S PROVIDER. WATCH!
1221 2018-03-23 21:05:33 66 scared the ultra-bulls straight. When they last got to 66.66, they learned the lesson to not distort oil prices over bull shit. The ones who did not learn that lesson will get hit again :)
1222 2018-03-23 21:05:24 How do I go in for an oil change and wait for 2 hours just to be told they can’t change my oil because there’s something wrong with my car?????
1223 2018-03-23 21:05:17 I'm wondering if she's being funded by foreign oil companies
1224 2018-03-23 21:05:04 True, but it has also DESTROYED environments. Ask Ecuador, Paraguay, Northwest states dealing with land theft for Keystone for a product we can't use, loss of topsoil, and all the organisms that keep it productive. You plan on eating oil and money?
1225 2018-03-23 21:05:00 yeah but his argument is well the world's always had periods where the temp increased, so this manmade global warming thing is bullshit, when even the major oil companies are on board with that idea
1226 2018-03-23 21:04:57 He never ever cared about you...hes getting rich off your tax dollars and never gave a damn about you...obama gave you healthcare and Trump gave you snake oil. Put that in your heart. And remember it
1227 2018-03-23 21:04:45 You forgot the biggest one "and your buying and selling of oil not with the US dollar". That's the real reason the "Land of the free's" state owned media has increased the "Putin" hate. 
PS yes he is evil but....

1233 2018-03-23 21:03:51 That feeling when you are finally home. It's Friday after a terribly long and exhausting week. Church bells ringing outside the window. You wash your face with goat milk soap and coconut oil. That fresh feeling. You put an audiobook on. Wear your fuzzy socks. You exhale.
1234 2018-03-23 21:03:41 Then I got 1 of those little messages in my head.

1240 2018-03-23 21:02:52 Not too many companies in Canada are 100 % owned by CDN’s, but the added taxes and royalties generated by getting our oil to the world market benefits all CDN’s.
1241 2018-03-23 21:02:49 I caught that, too. It goes along with Trump wanting to “keep the oil” and I never hear anyone call him on either of those things. Right now, Al Assad in Syria is a threat, but Putin backs him so Trump is mostly mum

1263 2018-03-23 20:58:40 Finished school, got my car an oil change, washed & vacuumed that bitch too, now Ima smoke this joint and eat fruit snacks right after, life is good.
1264 2018-03-23 20:58:38 Congress at anytime could have outlawed them.  Now, if you're referring to the ATF ruling that bumpstocks were labeled as firearms - that's a different matter but you know - you and facts are like oil and water.
1265 2018-03-23 20:58:31 I never understood how people always say th dealership service is a rip off. It’s the cheapest oil change I can find and they never rotate my tires unless it’s necessary even when I ask them to 
1266 2018-03-23 20:58:31 but they created more taxes so that should’ve solved their revenue problem... no wait they wasted that $ too. Problem is the spending not the lower oil prices.
1267 2018-03-23 20:57:52 Now I have to go back to washing with aqueous cream and moisturising with coconut oil until my skin behaves again...
Which means, no foundation. Not even a BB cream. Like what is life? 
1268 2018-03-23 20:57:40 Me: I finally have my priorities straight, I'll buy stuff for my oil change instead of vape shit.

Also me: yeah I don't have any money I spent it all on Little Debbie's
1269 2018-03-23 20:57:28 This last move was more on political posturing and very little fundamental oil supply demand facts. More rigs, minimums on draws. Weather cleaning up.  = more production.  Etc.
1270 2018-03-23 20:57:15 Guys... maybe, just maybe it's because Tesla doesn't make any service cars. No nevermind, that sounds way too rational, likely the reason is that Tesla cars are actually petrol cars with wireless gas injection and it's just a big scheme of big oil companies.
1271 2018-03-23 20:57:04 I remember My first time ever going to carros ian believe it when ppl said Issa Hotbox so my big head self oiled myself dwn in baby oil chile went in there & melted .
1272 2018-03-23 20:56:59 Every single country in the world which moving towards renewable energy had a path set up decade/s ago
Canada needs a short and  long term plan to achieve that goal
Like it or not much of our economy is dependant on oil tech. We risk econ collapse w/o it

1274 2018-03-23 20:56:57 Never thought I'd be the type to cuss while driving but these streets will oil your patience!
1275 2018-03-23 20:56:50 thanks to great opposition by the environmentalists, many of who get $ from the govt (who depend on these same oil & gas tax revenues). US leaving Canada behind in production, just a shame. Environmentalists wanting to make a real difference should go to Asia & protest pollution.
1276 2018-03-23 20:56:46 What perspective... so if tomorrow oil sells at $20 you think it will make sense to compare with past..reasonable people hold their leaders accountable not make dumb stupid comparisons
1277 2018-03-23 20:56:45 It is amazing that lemon can become oil.
1278 2018-03-23 20:56:45 Oooo, ok. What are some vegan meals you’ve had recently? If you’re cooking stir fries or things like that, maybe add a tiny bit more oil when cooking? Otherwise dressings or something
1279 2018-03-23 20:56:33 mano eu andei tanto hoje até o oil man encontrei
1280 2018-03-23 20:56:28 I don’t get oil production anymore haha wooooop I’ll wash it in the morning haha
1281 2018-03-23 20:56:06 She made it ...Engine light on, Oil light On, and fuck battery light ON.... I played phantom of the opera the whole way there but she made it

1283 2018-03-23 20:56:06 Waiting on an oil change. In a #gamestop . It's such a depressing place. Cynical video game publishing meets retail hellhole. You can feel how much the employees are fucked with and hate it there
1284 2018-03-23 20:56:03 No. But their oil is important to the global market; it's loss could raise the price of all barrels.
1285 2018-03-23 20:55:48 Haha I don’t even use much dry shampoo!! My medication for my acne means I don’t have any oil production!!
1286 2018-03-23 20:55:31 cider vinegar buttermilk, scratch mayo w/avocado oil, creme fraiche, dijon and sugar. My own maniacal riff on Cook's Country/ATK's offering.
1287 2018-03-23 20:55:17 That's interesting because Genie Oil might be interested to know that the Russians have a military presence right next door, in Syria, and may want to ask the Russians to stay out of their business.
1288 2018-03-23 20:55:14 i'm claiming the petro is just empty rhetoric, that there is no substance behind it (not referring to the oil or gold, that's another matter), which is pretty much the MO of most ICOs and crypto scams out there, so really nothing new under the sun
1289 2018-03-23 20:55:03 Most people protesting "NO" in these photos are wearing or using something made available through oil & gas. As well, 2nd comment, not true.  Companies care if they/their workers support the industry. I was asked to go support. @CanadaAction
1290 2018-03-23 20:55:03 Oil shud be scoring there.

1297 2018-03-23 20:53:44 Make sure you’re getting enough protein and fat!!! Add a drizzle of olive oil to pasta, or nuts / nut butters, avocado, coconut oil, etc
1298 2018-03-23 20:53:40 Plant fat? Odd category. Avacado oil, olive oil, coconut oil fine. Vegetable oils and nut oils not fine.
1299 2018-03-23 20:53:40 I would argue all day that Canadian oil  is better for the cumulative environment. (Water protection, land disturbance, wildlife, and emissions). Our regulations and culture alone ensure that
1300 2018-03-23 20:53:38 Guess who dropped a pan of boiling hot oil on there foot ??? Oh yh me 
1301 2018-03-23 20:53:19 Olive oil is my thinking music.
1302 2018-03-23 20:53:15 Why you have to speak about Obama's administration!!! Strange!!!! Oil your own machine. This is your time. Speak about your activity. This is losers behaviour to talk to opponent.
1303 2018-03-23 20:52:43 Yeah, it sounds weird to praise a movie where a giant robot picks up an oil tanker and uses it as a club for its verisimilitude, but it's there in the first movie.
Their actions feel properly weighty.
1304 2018-03-23 20:52:33 Lots of FUD around $FB and lots of emotional people coming out saying "I told you so". My contrarian instincts are starting to kick in.  $FB is not going anywhere any time soon. Data is the new oil and they have a stranglehold on it. Lots of retards still actively use it.
1305 2018-03-23 20:52:27 ^braiding it/tying your hair up also helps because it retains more of the natural oils. adding castor or coconut oil to your roots is also really helpful! i hear aloe helps a lot too but haven’t tried it myself
1306 2018-03-23 20:52:22 @RodneyChilders4  You guys put heaters like we do in your oil tanks for this weekend?
1307 2018-03-23 20:52:19 That would pretty much make you a pawn for the american oil company wouldn't it. Since you are acting in their interests and not canada's
1308 2018-03-23 20:52:00 At what long term cost to the environment and to future generation’s health.   You can’t drink oil, eat coal, or breath money.   Your children and their children will ask what happened to the polar bears, the rhinos, the salmon, and other endangered species, what will you say?

1310 2018-03-23 20:51:33 Traitors to Canada. Couldnt care less about foreign oil!
1311 2018-03-23 20:51:27 That is the new oil. Self-organization and holacracy are somehow related.

1313 2018-03-23 20:51:20 It’s not just our Government! Our entire corporate elite was on the plane to Riyadh with Trump begging for scraps from the Saudi’s. This has been going on since the discovery of oil.

1315 2018-03-23 20:51:12 Any thoughts on the decoupling of the stock market from oil prices?
1316 2018-03-23 20:51:09 Made me laugh!  Do you the mct oil and pure Irish butter in the coffee?  Breakfast of Champions! #camspiration
1317 2018-03-23 20:51:08 Just had a Krispy Kreme donut and it tasted like they fried it with palm oil 
1318 2018-03-23 20:51:06 That was my first thought. And while I think this is good idea, it concerns me that this could be a miss-allocation of resources if it takes away from other public funds. If they use oil and gas tax to fund it then by all means.
1319 2018-03-23 20:51:01 But fortunately we Nigeria ns r wiser...all those stats u gave hold no waters if we can't save during crude oil glorious time 2010-2014..
1320 2018-03-23 20:50:41 I disagree.  The Montney play in B.C/Alberta is one of the most prolific on the planet.  Our bitumen (we have numerous sources of “oil”, is slightly more so, but that’s where the opportunity lies!

1326 2018-03-23 20:50:10 Hi @ men I need one of you to explain 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner to me bc I don’t understand when shampoo is meant to clean and strip dirt and grease from your hair and most conditioners have oil in them to soften your hair?

1329 2018-03-23 20:49:39 They'll do exactly what Blackwater - later Xe, now Academi - did... rebrand and continue on.  I'm just very suspicious of the articles circulating saying CA didn't really do anything, they're selling snake oil and they were lying about their ability to impact elections.

1332 2018-03-23 20:49:26 Did you drive there? And are you aware the phone you are using is made of oil products? Just asking.
1333 2018-03-23 20:49:21 I think sometimes it results to the way formulations of liquid lipsticks are, and I use so many different brands when I mix. I’ve noticed it mostly when I mixed a more “mousse” texture with a v “wet” formulation. I guess it’s like oil and water 
1334 2018-03-23 20:49:18 The mighty, mighty oil business. I made good money in the oil industry. Now I’m just a running the ranch and loving it. Pay is not good but I’m doing what I love!
1335 2018-03-23 20:49:17 THE EARTH'S CORE NATURALLY PRODUCES OIL.
1336 2018-03-23 20:48:58 We must not forget most all the 9-11 terrorists came from Saudi. They messed us up over oil. They are not or friends. Other than making money off the west they would want us wiped out. If you want terrorists look no further than the Saudie's.
1337 2018-03-23 20:48:54 i love hyundai bc after they change my oil they wash my car and 
1338 2018-03-23 20:48:42 Yep. Not here for that BS. Shea butter w/ a little Vit E oil. Want to have it smell some way? +essential oil. Done.

1340 2018-03-23 20:48:30 It could but I think just a little. There is many countries which can increase the production of oil. Iran should be changed by helping the opposition. There is a lot of young people there and they are much more pro West then Arabs countries.

1349 2018-03-23 20:47:24 “Everyone” does not know that is illegal. Proof? Read the tweet I was responding to. (And dozens of other tweets sent @ my way from those who are absolutely convinced Big Oil funds the Tories and George Soros funds the Libs.

1351 2018-03-23 20:47:01 Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't the tories tell us back in 2014 that the OIL was running out, you really are an ODIOUS HYPOCRITICAL HEARTLESS LYING TORIE SCUM.

I love the light too. Looks like oil to me with the thick richness of the work.
1353 2018-03-23 20:46:54 a 5% sales tax and putting all royalties above $2 billion annually into a savings fund should be automatic.   We can argue the dates but oil will not last forever economically in Alberta...need something there when it goes away.
1354 2018-03-23 20:46:51 Bite your tongue!  I'm working on my retirement degree, which I'm hoping to get in about 7 years.  I'm a consultant, mainly for logistics and the oil business around the world, so I get around.  In my job, an opinion not based on facts can get someone killed.

All interest accumulated goes immediately to various cleanup jobs across the province.  If the 5B must be used, it has to be replaced before oil flows again.
1357 2018-03-23 20:46:30 The demographic itself doesn't stack up. People under 30 are way more likely to be connected by multiple social media platforms.. Yet they voted largely to remain (if I understand correctly).. 

CA were a snake oil company who convinced a lot of people...
1358 2018-03-23 20:46:24 I prefer to buy $SPY puts or $VXX calls when the mkt drops, since they provide Much larger gains & are more correlated to the overall mkt. Watching $FCX but it’s still consolidating. Great 3yr bases in Oil & energy sector looking good.

1371 2018-03-23 20:44:59 Yeah, like they have been sharing all the money made from oil sales among citizens..
1372 2018-03-23 20:44:56 The focus on cattle greenhouse gases are missing the point.
Cattle eat biomass. That carbon was already in the ecosystem, and it's recycled.
Coal, oil, and gas extract trapped carbon from outside circulation and adds it to the ecosystem, for a net increase.

1374 2018-03-23 20:44:38 expect US oil demand to rise with US supply, and still a net importer there
and transportation via sea of LNG to Asia is expensive, and Russia isn't short gas and can undercut US in price in Europe if it wants to (pipeline supply intrinsically cheaper)

1377 2018-03-23 20:44:33 OK. Wait for them to take your Oil.
Wake up. It's a grand plan destroy Syria Iraq and now Iran - your country.

1378 2018-03-23 20:44:30 that's been tested twice and found to be untrue....the only way it might be true is if we kicked out all the private companies and nationalized..."provincialized??" the oil and gas industry.
1379 2018-03-23 20:44:30 Oil is still Germany’s most important energy source.  So rather than important from russia.. why shouldn’t they be able to import from Canada via energy east?? See my point?

1385 2018-03-23 20:43:30 Made a typo on my last tweet about German so had to correct it. 
My point is the world needs to shift away from oil. Jobs are there. Economic gain can be made from renewables. We can no longer afford to merely talk "one day". I believe action is required now.
1386 2018-03-23 20:43:27 There is nothing more delicious than Shaggy Parasol Mushrooms. They dry well for Winter use as well. Cut into wedges and deep fry in your favourite oil. Rarely suffer from maggots. Steers nick my best ring every year!

1391 2018-03-23 20:42:50 I feel like i have to make a good preparation for everything. Never going outside with light bag. Tissue+wet tissue+hand sanitizer+liquid soap+dettol+scissors+small cutter+toothpicks+small mirror+parfume+cajuput oil+small note book+pen+plastic bags+eye drops+headphones too 
1392 2018-03-23 20:42:47 Nunca se me ocurrió cargar combustible en oil ni comprarles el aceite de oliva; es como que te toman de boludo y vos decís me gusta.
1393 2018-03-23 20:42:36 
1394 2018-03-23 20:42:33 How about we bring our own oil east? A pipeline is safer than rail cars.  But foreign owned oil companies want our oil out of the country so we have to buy from OPEC
1395 2018-03-23 20:42:30 Hope you brought some sanitizer. That snake oil and scent of skunk are notoriously difficult to remove too
1396 2018-03-23 20:42:21 U.S. Adds One Natural Gas Rig as Oil Gains Drive Domestic Tally Higher
1397 2018-03-23 20:42:17 Did you lobby or protest in #China or #India for a net reduction? Or in #Africa? As that is where the net growth is happening. So you propose to leave #Canada impoverished while other "cleaner" nations like Russia, Lybia, Venezuela or US fill oil & gas gap that we leave behind?
1398 2018-03-23 20:41:51 I have an idea for a book: “Great Men and their Hemorrhoids”!

1400 2018-03-23 20:41:47 LMAO last night at the show, some girl was like 'your highlight looks so good' and i deadass went 'thank you!! but if you see it on my forehead, its just oil' WHO SAYS THAT TO A STRANGER LMAO
1401 2018-03-23 20:41:43 I’m lik 70% sure I’m getting ripped off at the oil change place but I don’t care enough to do more research.
1402 2018-03-23 20:41:29 So the US oil price is 65/bbl. that should cause a boom in the Alberta oil patch.  But we have old cow communist notley so expect hard times. Wake up Alberta
1403 2018-03-23 20:41:29 Hey Michael! Thanks so much for the positive review. Others have used both of our products at the same time. Our CBD Oil is taken via sublingual administration (under the tongue, count to 30, swallow) -- that gets it directly into your bloodstream at a much higher dose.
1404 2018-03-23 20:41:28 Consensus (or weak hands if you wish) appears to be long stocks and, bizarrely, long USD and short oil. Fascinating to see oil rally and USD get smoked into an equity crash. Clearly a new regime for the dollar, the old “risk off” = “buy dollar” rule seems not to apply.
1405 2018-03-23 20:41:27 Have you tried with coconut oil?
1406 2018-03-23 20:41:25 If you saute your kale in coconut oil, it will slide more easily down the garbage disposal. #RejectedRecipeReviews
1407 2018-03-23 20:41:22 Also I changed over from a majority fast food and premade meals to almost all home cooked food, supplemented with fish oil for an anti-inflammatory, whey protein isolate for retaining muscle mass while losing weight, and multivitamins/vitamin d for general health.

1410 2018-03-23 20:41:07 Eww oil products are gross and harm the planet!

Silver Knight  @ 3/11 (19'5p) and White Knight @ 2/11(14.5p) 
No not a misprint 14.5p a GALLON !

1431 2018-03-23 20:38:17 Quevedo is a general following cuban training and instructions. This is why oil production will gradually continue dropping, and he will lose his job.
1432 2018-03-23 20:38:17 Middle east without doubt will be the biggy. Putin wants the oil price up and they can move weapons for profit in that area
1433 2018-03-23 20:37:48 @guardian I can't understand why the members of the Middle Eastern states of Opec, do not put a block on their oil, as their states are under attack!

1435 2018-03-23 20:37:38 Coconut oil is really a necessity for me
1436 2018-03-23 20:37:20 I think it’s a horrible idea. Imagine dropping something and it’s all dust, oil and grease 
1437 2018-03-23 20:37:16 My mind is an empty room. Where is the motor oil?
1438 2018-03-23 20:37:02 @ameyaw112 do you know why Ghana is receiving only 6% profit from tullow oil? Am I wrong?
1439 2018-03-23 20:37:02 This whole thing should read:  American oil company uses Canadian legal system to plunder our resources without creating long term jobs.
1440 2018-03-23 20:36:33 US oil companies drilling in the US will be fine. Trump said we are (or soon will be) the number one supplier of oil. 
If we're going to use oil we might as well use our own. It doesn't increase our oil consumption. It allows us to keep the profits instead of giving them to SA.

1446 2018-03-23 20:35:53 I haven't seen any PR about all the protests against the shipping on the East coast that brings in Middle East oil. What? That's not a thing? Hmm. Thought that's how a huge amount of oil got to Eastern Canada.

1459 2018-03-23 20:34:43 I suppose Iran could swipe off oil through Iraqi channels, but then how would Iraq explain all this heavy surge in its production??
1460 2018-03-23 20:34:38 In the #LAAdvisor, the @The_Dialogue reports that #Argentina’s unconventional production of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 was 33 percent higher than in 2015. But investors remain “wary of Argentina’s mercurial political history.”

1527 2018-03-23 20:24:46 have you tried boiling oil?

1528 2018-03-23 20:24:39 That just reminded me that I have argan oil! If that doesn't work, rose oil it issss
1529 2018-03-23 20:24:35 getting my last free oil change.....bitter sweet
1530 2018-03-23 20:24:18 What’s the young lady name  #Stunning
1531 2018-03-23 20:23:51 It's nowhere near strong enough. I've got prescription meds & just started on CBD oil capsules
1532 2018-03-23 20:23:13 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
1533 2018-03-23 20:23:06 I need to get a oil change. Lemme tryna book a photoshoot to pay for this expenses
1534 2018-03-23 20:23:01 Looks like #oil #brent will move into new trading range above $70. Support companies with cash reserve / appreciation in this space for best exposure to exponential upside
1535 2018-03-23 20:22:50 Let me get my ass up  I need to go get a oil change, I need Breia to do my brows.. allat 
1536 2018-03-23 20:22:48 "eating fatty foods likely fried in oil might be bad"
1537 2018-03-23 20:22:45 Low volume particularly concerning as are higher oil prices (implied tax on consumption). 10 yr note is tame, but margin rates are up. Monday is not looking too good.
1538 2018-03-23 20:22:43 Sandie( my car ) just got her oil changed 
1539 2018-03-23 20:22:42 Talked to my dad today on the way to PT @queenkandis, he agrees home ownership is a farce and we all bought the snake oil.
1540 2018-03-23 20:22:29 I’d wait for one hundred oil changes per day if it meant I didn’t have to work/pay for stuff. Adulting sucks.
1541 2018-03-23 20:22:12 Is that yam and oil???
#BBNaija
1542 2018-03-23 20:22:10 And his response will be: “did we take the oil?”
1543 2018-03-23 20:22:07 I didn’t have to pay for my oil change ayeee 
1544 2018-03-23 20:21:58 Incredible! After we stickered their stores and sent 45,000 emails, Holland & Barrett  decided to ditch krill oil products that were putting the Antarctic  Ocean at risk. This is proof of how when we work together, we can make a  huge impact. Thanks Holland & Barrett & Greenpeace
1545 2018-03-23 20:21:56 I forgot to put oil this morning
1546 2018-03-23 20:21:40 The smell of this castor oil in my hair annoys me so much
1547 2018-03-23 20:21:40 Weakness in tech and concerns about a trade war combined to give us the worst week in over a year:
Dow -5.7%
S&P 500 -6%
NASDAQ -6.5%
Russell -4.7%
Oil +5.6%
Gold +2.9%
1548 2018-03-23 20:21:20 what oil is that
1549 2018-03-23 20:21:13 chino would use much less low-grade diesel oil to have tankers import nuts from the Philippines. We only export nuts coz the cartons would otherwise be empty on the way home.
1550 2018-03-23 20:21:07  You’re in real estate not oil!
1551 2018-03-23 20:21:04 You realize the world still runs mostly by oil products, so it still comes regardless. If you stop all oil/gas the world would collapse & you can't get that sweet pineapple you love so dearly.
1552 2018-03-23 20:20:48 You can filter and reuse the oil
1553 2018-03-23 20:20:43 You may not realize the House votes whether to impeach. If the House impeaches, the Senate tries the case. The Chief Justice oversees the trial. He *will* be impeached if the Dems take the House. After that, it's up to the Senate to convict or not. I'm not selling snake oil.
1554 2018-03-23 20:20:37 Crab footballer #England
1555 2018-03-23 20:20:31 Your right But it’s reality. So with that - what’s better: buy oil from Saudi, Venezuela, Texan oilfields or from Canada with the most stringent environmental, health, safety, and  ethical regulations on the planet! Oh and it brings in billions which fund health, ed,  and ur CPP!
1556 2018-03-23 20:20:18 caster oil
1557 2018-03-23 20:20:13 Good promising start England, Henderson really slows us down with his backwards sideways passing. Rashford Sterling Ox Lingard fast dynamic players. Imagine Jack Wiltshire In his place  #England
1558 2018-03-23 20:20:12 The whole fucken car gota smell like egyptian musk body oil and rubbin alcohol until yo destination
1559 2018-03-23 20:20:11 I bake them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I'll sprinkle some pancetta on there if I want a little something extra. 
1560 2018-03-23 20:19:51 Yes it’s drying but you can get the salicylic acid moisturizer which is double the work for your face , and add like an oil if it’s still too dry for you & oooh I’ve been dying to try that 
1561 2018-03-23 20:19:43 Great to see the Indy supporters celebrating the discovery, if only the oil price was $110 a barrel as per their beloved SNP white paper and it’s accurate financial projections.....then we could send proud Edwards army homeward tae think again... 
1562 2018-03-23 20:19:40 Prompt month oil +10% -ish since 3/14.  $XOP flat since then.  Oil stocks no longer follow oil.
1563 2018-03-23 20:19:10 27' Yeah the boys! Some great defence in display and we still lead here at the Crown Oil Arena.
1564 2018-03-23 20:19:01 Waiting for an oil change is one of my least favorite parts about adulting. #saveme
1565 2018-03-23 20:18:48 Oil change and listening to Dr Oz talk about pooping
1566 2018-03-23 20:18:46 Unlike the strike of 2002 in PDVSA led by top managers against former president Hugo Chavez which aimed to topple him, this time the most deprived sector in the oil area in #Venezuela are simple and skilled oil workers suffering harsh conditions.something could happen soon #oott
1567 2018-03-23 20:18:44 ASIDE FROM TOOTHPASTE (A NATURAL ONE NOT THE GARBAGE THAT U CAN GET MOSTLY EVERYWHERE) A TOOTHBRUSH, ALMOND/COCONUT OIL, DR BRONNERS AND A NATURAL DEODORANT WTF DO U NEED IN A BATHROOM ASIDE FROM THAT
1568 2018-03-23 20:18:40 BothI push the pore filling one in so my texture disappears & my oil stays lowkey but I like the dewy glow & moisture from the NYX one but I will say summer coming I probably won’t be able to use the NYX one as much w/ my skin type 
1569 2018-03-23 20:18:34 @MCGprofessional cement itself is used as an oil stabiliser #MCGSP
1570 2018-03-23 20:18:31 It makes me sad that Ferrero, the makers of Nutella are not part of this, because they use palm oil and I imagine an enormous quantity of it 
1571 2018-03-23 20:18:14 If only the issue were about one thing, like safety or the environment, but it's not.

I wish Twitter was a good conduit for this. I had this convo with Kid1 who is a conductor for CN and doesn't want to die transporting oil

My FIL did these same stunts as a US rep and I approve
1572 2018-03-23 20:18:08 He probably only buys gas that comes from Saudi on tanker ship then hauled by semi truck to his 7-11 down the street. Clueless people.. When they live a oil free lifestyle then you can preach to the rest of us ffs.
1573 2018-03-23 20:18:08 take lots of fish oil, dont eat food and drink lots of water
1574 2018-03-23 20:18:05 Adulting: buying chicken while it's on sale, freezing it for later, taking it out of the freezer to thaw, then marinating it in a ziplock with olive oil, garlic, ginger, and spices. Put it back in the fridge for several hours. Then, clean up the kitchen after. What?? I'm an adult
1575 2018-03-23 20:17:51 Like the one they did in Iraq, that kind of change? To wipe out the Middle East entirely from the map kind? To creat another unstable country so they can benefit from its oil kind?
1576 2018-03-23 20:17:51 They say you fight for G.O.D, Gold Oil Drugs
1577 2018-03-23 20:17:41 Also interesting is the imminent sale of $350m in the strategic oil reserve to fund god ( @GOP )knows what?  
That’s some serious gop *strateeggery*. Should have no effect on fuel prices

1584 2018-03-23 20:16:53 You're making a joke, right? Foreign interests have been interfering in 'our economy' since before confederation. Who do you think runs most of the oil sands projects and pipelines? Foreign interests.

1586 2018-03-23 20:16:33 We get oil from Iran?
1587 2018-03-23 20:16:29 The world needs an oil replacement, which we have.
1588 2018-03-23 20:16:28 Maybe Canada should worry about the fact they have to sell their crude oil to the USA, who then resells them gasoline, since Canada doesn't have the oil and gas infrastructure other leading oil exporters around the world have.
1589 2018-03-23 20:16:27 IT'D BE COOL IF THERE WAS A NATURAL TOOTHPASTE THAT WORKED AS A DEODORANT AND HAIR OIL, MAYBE THERE IS I GOTTA THINK ABOUT THIS
1590 2018-03-23 20:16:17 I really love oil pens but $50 a cartridge?! ¡No mames, güey!

1595 2018-03-23 20:15:43 New fitness goal: be able to beat Kylo Ren in a pushup contest. Then I'll steal his body oil and walk around topless as often as possible. 

Cause if I can't start laughing about this I'm never gonna recover.
1596 2018-03-23 20:15:35 Oil will run out eventually and green energy is coming. They wanna diversify, it's part of why they're trying to become a vacation spot.
1597 2018-03-23 20:15:26 Ratings agency DBRS Ltd. calls Alberta's budget "a pipeline dream" and says "much of the improvement in the outer years of the forecast depends greatly on rising resource royalties and increased oil export capacity." #abbudget
1598 2018-03-23 20:15:17 You realize oil products still have to make their way, does it just magically appear in your gas tank? & the banana's you eat is walked from Panama to your local grocery store haha. I prefer my oil to come via truck personally, that way it spills on the highway & not the forest..
1599 2018-03-23 20:15:08 Hopefully she didn't consume any oil/ oil products on her way to the protest
1600 2018-03-23 20:14:56 i use coconut oil religiously
1601 2018-03-23 20:14:55 You can be an usher for a security company. I used to work for this company at Lucas Oil Stadium. The terms are interchangeable, and certainly doesn’t excuse a grown adult shoving a disabled person

1605 2018-03-23 20:14:43 Looking back at when @pinkvxdka’s dad sprayed oil in my hair... regret not taking advantage of it. I live for that shit now 
1606 2018-03-23 20:14:40 @ElizabethMay I am just curious, how did you get to the protest today? I would guess by plane and/or a vehicle? Both of which require oil! Stop being such a hypocrite! You are a disgrace to Canada
1607 2018-03-23 20:14:30 *goes full possum meme* i reject face oil!
1608 2018-03-23 20:14:28 Seems there is oil leakage from the truck ... surely this cleaning can be done quickly .. traffic at this time is totally unacceptable
1609 2018-03-23 20:14:24 Maybe IPO Saudi Aramco moves oil prices. Maybe this is the cause of concern. Hope so
1610 2018-03-23 20:14:13 What is up with Oil / SP relationship? Oil is reaching new highs, SP is almost going to new lows? Is this normal?
1611 2018-03-23 20:14:09 Dietitians jumped all over Dr. Atkins after his death but Duke U's Diet Center uses a lot of the Atkins Plan. Some female research profs studying coconut oil said sexism played a large part in how their findings were viewed. Not exactly the Scientific Method...
1612 2018-03-23 20:14:08 Like king Saudi who brutal leader and awful ruler poor human rights and women rights but at least keeps Saudi in control and pro West and most importantly we get oil and defence sells

1614 2018-03-23 20:14:00 .. and they wanted to : 

The Irvings had their hopes dashed in October when plans were scrapped for the $15.7-billion Energy East pipeline, which would carry over a million barrels of oil from Alberta to Saint John, N.B. 

thanks but no thanks

1627 2018-03-23 20:12:13 “You need to get oil for your car.” 

“Ok, I’ll go to Target.”

“But the auto store is right here.”

1638 2018-03-23 20:11:02 And why is the UN not forcing Islamic oil rich countries - close by & similar weather/culture/language etc to take any refugees at all. Most of these women & children do NOT want to come here. I've seen so many interviews in camps & they don't want to come west they say.

1643 2018-03-23 20:10:12 Yes , and if you like oils on your face try any with vitam C & tea tree oil  the salicylic acid is a face cleanser , or you could just get antibiotics prescribed

It is foolish to leave oil or gas in the ground & not monetize it. If Canada doesn’t sell its oil or gas someone else will. It’s economic suicude & irrelevant climate-wise!! Canada is an energy giant and it’s unwise to prevent it @jkenney @jjhorgan

1647 2018-03-23 20:09:26 Cedi vs. Other Major Currencies:  

Dr. Bawumia promised to arrest the Dollar in 48hrs.  Well, even as Oil prices have recovered, and our total output has increased, the Cedi is faring much worse on NADAA/Bawumia's watch than during the Atta Mills/Mahama administration.
1648 2018-03-23 20:09:02 You too have a great weekend. I added small EOG Jul C. Lets see if oil stocks get a lift soon. Unfortunately I sold half my SPY puts too early.

1652 2018-03-23 20:08:37 Correction: 'Until', not 'unless'
It will.
Stewart argues BC bears most of the risk from the pipeline but gets almost none of the benefits. “We won’t see a drop of this oil unless it spills out.”

"to suppress great technology."
1654 2018-03-23 20:08:31 end of day oil companies are providing a product that the world is demanding and that demand is going up so get rid of the demand and you''ll limit the oil being produced.
1655 2018-03-23 20:08:28 So let me get this straight, these people would rather have oil from countries like Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and UAE who have crappy environmental and human rights records but not from a place with the highest environmental standards in the world. Makes no sense.

1661 2018-03-23 20:07:22 Here's how we can start correcting the problem John Kasich. We can raise income taxes on all those earning more than $150,000, increase the inheritance tax, and remove tax breaks that businesses love, esp breaks for coal and oil companies. No cure but it's a start!
1662 2018-03-23 20:07:17 I smell local skimming at work. Cotton, Boozman, Hill and  Crawford, men not to be trusted. Rick Perry is a big money oil company stooge. But what difference anyway, no stopping this train wreck.
1663 2018-03-23 20:07:17 I’ve seen oil going for the moon while the S&P500 was drilling its way to some paydirt. It was in the summer of 2008 if I remember right. Can’t recall what happened next

1667 2018-03-23 20:06:57 The sudden dramatic decoupling of what had been close to a mirroring of the oil and stocks markets is one of the more bizarre short term shifts I can recall
1668 2018-03-23 20:06:12 Just air fry stuff.  Just as unhealthy, but less oil.

1672 2018-03-23 20:05:27 ohhhh that’s actually an amazing idea. white wine and olive oil is such a good combo and it would replace that lemon tang really nicely. you’re a genius

1677 2018-03-23 20:04:58 I do hope you are not typing on a computer or phone - the plastic in them comes from oil. Hypocrite !
1678 2018-03-23 20:04:51 Dark times - hate rules in DC & those wankers are bought by Zionists & Saudis -- that is oil and water so Drumpf might have a reckoning with them before he is impeached.
1679 2018-03-23 20:04:49 you do know that the oil companies pushing for pipelines are almost all foreign-owned, right?
1680 2018-03-23 20:04:43 Putin wants 2 take over world & he just might succeed with help of DT who is purposely hiring losers 2 destroy all dem. institutions... naturally. How does it make sense to hire Pruitt, who once and probably still represents oil companies, as the EPA guy?
1681 2018-03-23 20:04:43 Just go straight to shots of whiskey. Vaseline or Vit E oil on/in your nose will help with the raw-ness too. Hope you feel better soon! 
1682 2018-03-23 20:04:43 Yes. But the refineries in US count on getting our oil cheap. Big money is behind the protests.
1683 2018-03-23 20:04:38 Hypocrite, each one of them! Don't protest against oil imports from middle East! Would rather see Canadians unemployed!
1684 2018-03-23 20:04:26 You have to eliminate a medieval socio-political construct pretending to be a religion that murders LBGTx folk, oppresses womyn, enables slavery, and promotes wars for oil. Economic improvement will follow.
1685 2018-03-23 20:04:26 how about some stuff during the opec oil shock. Berlin Wall coming down. The misogyny of Ian Fleming?

1688 2018-03-23 20:03:56 Got to 11 minutes on my stationary bike two days in a row without feeling like I'm gonna die afterwards. Progress. I mean, kinda slow progress. But still progress. CBD oil + higher Imuran dose seems to be making some difference.
1689 2018-03-23 20:03:47 Midterms are gonna be a shit show.
1690 2018-03-23 20:03:36 What the crap! Did you go with synthetic oil?
Cause make sure you stick with synthetic then for all future oil changes unless you have your engine flushed.
(Yeah I've learned some stuff)
1691 2018-03-23 20:03:33 In future if cooking at high temperatures, it may be necessary to slightly grease the paper with butter or oil to prevent food from sticking. (2/3)
1692 2018-03-23 20:03:31 It’s no longer about the base,the rest of America knows he is a snake oil salesmen,and has become dare I say just another politician.
1693 2018-03-23 20:03:28 Hi Adele, greaseproof paper is paper which is impermeable to oil or grease, this means that oil or grease cannot pass through the paper. This does not mean that the paper will not stick to food. (1/3)
1694 2018-03-23 20:03:18 Personally, I don't buy that rag, so oil have to take your word for it! ;)
1695 2018-03-23 20:02:49 I wouldn't be surprised ! However because of our stupid policies several big oil multinationals pulled out of Alberta.
1696 2018-03-23 20:02:46 I just came for an oil change all them other things wrong with my car don't matter today
1697 2018-03-23 20:02:41 I made an appointment for an oil change on Monday and my maintenance light just came on. Perfect timing.
1698 2018-03-23 20:02:38 But we’re not equal. Most women do what..... work desk jobs or are healthcare providers. The working conditions have ac and are not labor demanding. Men work as mechanics or other manly jobs like that. They are outside hauling tires, dealing with oil and shit along with 90-100-
1699 2018-03-23 20:02:34 So freaking funny! Lol.  Protests over Canadian oil, but won't say boo about oil imports. Your a hypocrite May!
1700 2018-03-23 20:02:11 Oh, we love ‘Avatar’, the highest-grossing film of all time. It’s memorable characters... Sam and... Uni. The storyline... with the tree’s oil vs the army. They rode dragons at one point or maybe they were big birds? Giovanni Ribissi?  We love Groot!
1701 2018-03-23 20:02:10 Just bought tea tree oil. How do I dilute it

1705 2018-03-23 20:01:23 That feeling when you go for an oil change and they tell you your car is literally fucked                                            but at least it's shiny
1706 2018-03-23 20:01:18 Whoa. #akleg Senate getting a lil spicy. 

1 of 5  right now, but Sen. Mackinnon spoke out of turn after already speaking to correct a falsehood previously stated.

They've had 2 at eases to pull back on the reins. Wielechowski's annual amendment and oil pitch is happening.

1710 2018-03-23 20:01:09 It's a super pore-clogging oil, rates 4/5 on the comodegenic scale and the molecules are actually too big to be absorbed by your hair follicle so it just sit on the outer layer, looking greasy 
1711 2018-03-23 20:01:01 Have you heard about all the benefits of Olive Oil!!! AMAZING!

1713 2018-03-23 20:00:50 Wow, that's harsh.  I was hoping you'd be feeling better today, after a night's sleep.  Would you mind if I did a simple candle magic spell for your health? It's nothing major, just a lit candle with an essential oil for healing, probably Rosemary, and a healing rune.

1717 2018-03-23 20:00:47 Question: Why do Saudi Arabia and UAE want/need nuclear power? Their oil reserves are among the world's largest. It just doesn't make sense to me.
1718 2018-03-23 20:00:46 I'm curious, what environmentally responsible oil transportation methods are you proposing instead of pipelines?

On GG's contributions, everyone is blaming the oil price and all. But is there anything he did to improve on our igr from the last administration? Agencies like Eswama stopped working, the transport scheme is going moribund....
1726 2018-03-23 20:00:28 Aku biasanya pake extraordinary oil dari loreal tapi udah 2 bulan ini ga pake karena kemaren2 pake buat heat protector sebelum catokan. Rontok tuh kayaknya lebih dari 50 helai gitu deh

Aaaaaa dari yang gampang makan kacang2an aja aku jarang banget huhu. Btw terima kasih banyak

1728 2018-03-23 20:00:17 Bruh I was like a new lambo when I met her. Had a couple of miles on me still kinda new ya know mint conditioned and shit but boy i am a real life hoopdee I got at least 400,000 on my shit with no oil change
1729 2018-03-23 20:00:11 Me: It’s important to be mindful of cultural artifacts from your forebears.       My brain once a month without warning : .. bubbling crude.. oil that is!
1730 2018-03-23 20:00:07 I disagree on a lot. Oil need a 1B goal tender to push Talbot. RNH and McDavid work well. Find Drai 1 winger to have chemistry. Moto needs to be in Bako for the entire season. He CANNOT fix what Edmonton needs. Trade Kassian as he is not as hungry as he was last year.
1731 2018-03-23 20:00:07 March is National Nutrition Month!

Choose coconut oil for when roasting vegetables at high temperatures in your oven. Most people typically turn to olive oil but it can turn rancid at high temps.
1732 2018-03-23 20:00:05 tempted to learn how to deep fry things but seems like an insane waste of oil if I only do it once every couple months

1739 2018-03-23 19:59:38      buy beard oil, u refuse
1740 2018-03-23 19:59:33 Yes hemp seeds are rich in bioavailable proteins so it is a great alternative to soy products. The oil is rich in omegas so its more beneficial than fish oil. #tsudchs
1741 2018-03-23 19:59:08 Line-Item Veto's are also unconstitutional... Why is it that "Patriots" have such a poor understanding of American Politics, the Constitution, or past Supreme Court Decisions? Clinton tried to line-item veto in 1998- Supreme Court ruled this was unconstitutional.

1745 2018-03-23 19:58:58 It means you actually have dry skin but your skin is over producing oil to try to compensate for how dry it is. If you moisturize really well every time you wash your face (preferably with something that has lavender in it) then it should balance out 
1746 2018-03-23 19:58:55 My car has been at the service center for a simple oil change and inspection for over 4 hours now

They're currently excluded. #akleg

1760 2018-03-23 19:57:09 aww so sorry. Are you eating lots of high CBD, whole plant activated coco oil? You need to be administering every which way from Sunday!!! Cannabis will make your body inhospitable for the virus and it will pack up and leave. Or you'll have fun trying. Get well soon.
1761 2018-03-23 19:57:06 I hope they march at the range. See how that works out.

1775 2018-03-23 19:53:58 Donating it is not an issue like oil companies do to NDDC, but justifying the spendings and positive impacts it ought to create in the sector is the major challenge in decades. Look at the Boroh or Shittu issue in public domain as a case study.
1776 2018-03-23 19:53:51 They aren't protesting oil, or oil byproducts. They are protesting the pipeline, inevitable future leaks, and the long lasting environmental impact it will impose. Please keep up, it's really not that hard to comprehend.

1785 2018-03-23 19:52:41 my friend told me she liked my nose highlight but it’s just oil 
1786 2018-03-23 19:52:37 Bout to fall asleep while waiting to have my oil changed at West Chevrolet. Help. Open eyes. Open. 
1787 2018-03-23 19:52:36  I have to top up the oil most week mate spent a fortune on the stuff 
1788 2018-03-23 19:52:26 Honestly a lot of the fans here are unbearable. I have always defended Oil fans but after the playoffs last year I think they might be even worse than Leafs or Canucks fans. But to be clear, the ones I interact with on Twitter are wonderful :)
1789 2018-03-23 19:52:23 Motions Oil Sheen has been around for a while, and is super helpful! It does feel a bit greasy, so don't go too overboard with it, but that does help with the detangling! I can usually keep Epic's long wigs manageable at a con just with some occasional finger-combing, too.

1791 2018-03-23 19:52:20 Getting my oil changed the day after my light came on. I’ve never felt more like a responsible adult.
1792 2018-03-23 19:52:18 There are two different types of oils : drying and non-drying oils. Drying oils will change from liquid to a solid film when exposed to oxygen in the air. Nut oils (boiled linseed, tung oil, etc.) are drying oils, but vegetable (peanut, olive) and mineral oils are non-drying.
1793 2018-03-23 19:52:16 I don’t like the Oil meme because there’s nothing revolutionary or even particularly funny about Americans joking about how fucked up our military apparatus is when they’re not the ones who have to suffer from it but  beats more chum bucket memes I guess
1794 2018-03-23 19:52:02 Build refineries where the oil is drilled, they have already destroyed their lands. #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
1795 2018-03-23 19:51:57 That is a real win! I'm a bit jealous. Best hash browns IMHO are the Marks and Spencer ones which have onion in them, cooked like roasties with plenty of oil. Second only potato wise to actual roasties covered in gravy.
1796 2018-03-23 19:51:47 I could understand this if you were advocating for the protection of the coast from oil skills from the tankers, railway cars and pipelines that deliver oil already. Get rid of the tankers too, then you’ll have a credible argument.
1797 2018-03-23 19:51:45 The world needs oil, so let them have the most environmentally and socially responsible oil on the planet... Canadian oil! We should be proud of this.

1802 2018-03-23 19:51:04 Let's be real here. Bakit naman din ako magpapakapagod sa TS o film na barya lang compared sa  endorsements. Kaya nga INGGIT SILANG LAHAT. They have to burn their oil & won't even compare. Sorry kayo. M is blessed! Sorry, di kayo si M!
1803 2018-03-23 19:51:04 It is no accident that the poorest places on earth are sources of valuable natural resources: diamonds, oil, cobalt, bauxite, copper, gold. Colonialism facilitates extraction.
1804 2018-03-23 19:51:02 Agree! Biggest rotation play of year.  LT target on OIL is PAR imo.
1805 2018-03-23 19:50:53 Our “environment” is one of the most pristine on the planet.  Why is that Erin?? Because we have a strong economy to pay for it all.  Environmental protection through regulation and sound markets comes at a cost. A cost paid for by oil revenue.  This is good.

1807 2018-03-23 19:50:24 The unhackable property is a product of proof of work, hash rate, and decentralized nodes tracking the ledger. I assure you the USPS will not have these properties. Some consultant sold them snake oil.

1811 2018-03-23 19:50:11 She be like all the money was embezzled by previous government price of oil drop to 30 naira per barrel no money for development. Bill gate will be like hmm hmm
1812 2018-03-23 19:50:08 Until you walk your talk, I'll just assume you are a BS Snake Oil Salesman.   Example, until Al Gore gets rid of his mansions and stops flying around the world, how could you take him seriously on CO2.  Like a Dr. smoking, while he tells me to stop smoking - but Dr. buys offsets?
1813 2018-03-23 19:50:08 omg im sitting next to the sassiest older british woman and its honestly making getting my oil change so much better bless you sassy brit 
1814 2018-03-23 19:50:05 With oil rising so much, Transports should follow through to downside.
1815 2018-03-23 19:49:54 Does the #StopKM group care about the millions of MT of American Oil that passes through BC waters, or is just your fellow Canadians you are trying to screw?

1816 2018-03-23 19:49:38 ....defend themselves, they can project outward militarily. China, Russia, and Iran have the ability to destabilize the U.S. economy. First step would be to devalue the dollar. Second would be to destabilize oil prices. Third is the one that worries me the most, China, through...
1817 2018-03-23 19:49:34 $100 oil changes... fuck new sports cars son

1821 2018-03-23 19:49:18 This body lotion by Nivea with almond oil would br great if it smelled like almonds instead of this strongly scented floral/perfumy scent. 

I should have got the unscented.
1822 2018-03-23 19:49:15 i think it was the amount of water in the marinated chicken mixing with the 425 degree oil in the pan :/ i shouldn’t have put so much oil down i think or dried the chicken better :///
1823 2018-03-23 19:49:00 The dudes in this training class smell like spoiled goat oil
1824 2018-03-23 19:49:00 You mean it makes no sense if you make your $ shilling for the oil & gas industry. Or are you still living off the $ Mike Duffy gave you? It's a "Fair Question". #StopKM #cdnpoli
1825 2018-03-23 19:48:47 doing the work of US oil companies. @NDP must be so proud #cdnpoli
1826 2018-03-23 19:48:43 So 3 man city players starting but the biased wankers keep harping on how oil money is ruining football
1827 2018-03-23 19:48:31 Oil went from $150 to $40. Alberta burnt down TWICE. Thank god we had all services funded to make sure people were safe. PC spent all our savings and spent like crazy. Then in-fought then called an early election then lost then merged and have been complaining ever since.
1828 2018-03-23 19:48:29 No. It's pure chicken skins rendered in its own fat. We don't even use oil. – bij Nong’s Khao Man Gai
1829 2018-03-23 19:48:16 This is a good one!! There are alternatives to Oil & Gas but no ALTERNATIVE TO WATER 《♡♡♡♡》everyone needs ~Water~ for ~Life~ it's no JOKE and NOT something that some corporations can ☆RISK FOR PROFIT!!☆
1830 2018-03-23 19:48:13 I think this oil is breaking my face out  bro I am NOT living my best life rn.
1831 2018-03-23 19:48:08 I know someone who has extensive knowledge of psychodemographic surveys and apparently the more sophisticated ones can actually allow for that. He’s made a living out of it and I’ve seen proven results (ie he’s not selling snake oil).
1832 2018-03-23 19:48:08 I live in London have all my life...wouldn't pay that much for what is 35p worth of potato dropped into hot oil!
1833 2018-03-23 19:48:08 I had it in the same bun for like 2.5 days, but once I took it out I just added a coconut oil product and took a straightener to it and viola it looked fine.
1834 2018-03-23 19:48:04 No, but you can apply for a permit to mine "clean" coal or drill for oil while you camp.
1835 2018-03-23 19:47:50 Here in GA we have a lot of inconsistency. The current Atlanta sheriff isn't prosecuting possession, but other departments are. CBD oil is recently legal & medical marijuana is for a limited # of conditions but there's no legal way to get MMJ here. Basically it's a legal mess.
1836 2018-03-23 19:47:44 Nobody is going to impeach Trump so quit selling a snake oil.  Even if Dem's regain the House after Midterm's... Republicans will still control the Senate and you're NEVER going to get 2/3rds of Senate to vote against the President!
1837 2018-03-23 19:47:43 Woohoo! I was able to deal with the problem. Oil changed! I feel complete now.
1838 2018-03-23 19:47:32 funny the Left in Canada doesn't protest OPEC oil imports or US tankers passing Vancouver Island, only export of Canadian oil and gas.
1839 2018-03-23 19:47:24 Not one off those players look interested  that oil mcburnie is an ugly skinny albino like..mon the John McGinn 
1840 2018-03-23 19:46:34 Good try with Indian food  replace honey with sugar can avoid all ginger garlic as well onion in curry just butter/tomatoes /Honey/Cream/Kasoori methi and mix with tandoori chicken /Boneless is best /can mix little mustard oil as while grill
1841 2018-03-23 19:46:28 She reached behind her taking the oil bottle with both of her small hands she hold it up to her as she smile at her.
1842 2018-03-23 19:46:22 Girl we should do an oil show together! 
1843 2018-03-23 19:46:20 It's the little habits that contribute 2 the whole success. Start w. habits like a daily walk or only using oil &amp; vinegar 4 salad dressing.
1844 2018-03-23 19:46:10 Students. 
Too much wine. 
Ran out of wine and glasses. 
Somebody picks up bottle of olive oil. 'If you drink a cup of this I'll run out and buy you a bottle of champagne.' 

What can I say? I was young, drunk, broke and dumb. And I really liked champagne.
1845 2018-03-23 19:46:04 Import through the nose. By faith alone. Season's weather. Gomorrha. Salong. Lots feed from my tidetable. Oil's wells in our lands.
1846 2018-03-23 19:45:54 THEENNNNN he grabs my castor oil
1847 2018-03-23 19:45:46 Combine 2 cups barbecue with 9 oz daily bread. Blend with Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve warm.
1848 2018-03-23 19:45:43 Will running costs for fossil fuel cars start to increase as mechanical driveline spare parts become harder to get, while oil prices rise due to falling production and skilled mechanics become scarce? #EV #4IR
1849 2018-03-23 19:45:35 I’m at the age where I’m fully confident going to get an oil change on my own but call my dad to see if I’m doing it right
1850 2018-03-23 19:45:35 “Aw~, Love. Your tummy will stop growling once I fed that cute little mouth of yours. 

Now, can you grab the oil? It’s right behind you.”
1851 2018-03-23 19:45:34 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
1852 2018-03-23 19:45:22 8/10 men get better looking with age & I'm over here like: "If I eat veg every day, slather every part of my body in coconut oil, & sacrifice beauty products in a pagan ceremony, I'll have 3.67 years before I need filler cream & the rest of my hair turns grey." #FridayFeeling
1853 2018-03-23 19:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1854 2018-03-23 19:45:19 Oil change , new windshield wipers and a full tank of gas 
1855 2018-03-23 19:45:17 Oklahoma is still very much dependent on the oil industry. Unfortunately our corrupt legislature could not manage money if their lives depended on it so the state is not well off.
1856 2018-03-23 19:45:06 I miss the old days when you were a legitimate and respected physician. Now you’re a snake oil salesmen and right-wing shill.
1857 2018-03-23 19:45:02 Had a 2 hour massage today, getting my oil changed and getting yummy food after.
1858 2018-03-23 19:44:58 It's a real pleasure applying lightly scented cinnamon beard oil after a refreshing shower. 
1859 2018-03-23 19:44:55 They get other supplements too. Missing Link is a good one. Plus kibble, omega oil. I gotta look into cat food. That'll be more difficult.
1860 2018-03-23 19:44:43 Mr. Musk is more like snake oil salesman, he sells vision but does not deliver. He gets gov subsidies we get taxes to pay for them.
1861 2018-03-23 19:44:43 I took the last vitamin E oil from Target, without fighting someone too. What a day.
1862 2018-03-23 19:44:29 I figured out that doing a sugar/coconut oil scrub on my lips helps mitigate that "I have dermatillomania and picking at my skin is my anxiety coping mechanism" look AAAAND I'm designing my cap decor in Photoshop because I Am A Wizard. Life is good
1863 2018-03-23 19:44:10 SA = Gold and diamonds still controlled by WMC and Nigeria = Oil still controlled by the likes of Exxon and Shell so it isn't a coincidence. These African 'superpowers' are still under the control of white interests.
1864 2018-03-23 19:43:53 So you're say you gonna move downtown now. To many honey oil explosions in Brookside?

1870 2018-03-23 19:43:03 This is the most adorable thing ever. I just pictured my dad getting the 80s Ford F150 out of the garage, changing the oil, putting some snacks in a beat up cooler, and now I'm not crying *you're* crying this is so pure!
1871 2018-03-23 19:43:02 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
1872 2018-03-23 19:42:44 I hope you told him he is a very naughty boy, bringing money and hope to the oil and gas industry in North Sea. Especially after you and your ilk have told us for years it was finished or on it’s last legs. Who have you lied to? Mr Conacher, or Scottish people?

1878 2018-03-23 19:41:02 Idk why i just thought about when we went to the Oil Spill and walked all the way to the line and they were upcharging at the door

1880 2018-03-23 19:40:57 Seems perfume oil is the new business trend.

1882 2018-03-23 19:40:45 Just remember to mix the mustard oil back in.. oxidation does reduce burn tho.
1883 2018-03-23 19:40:37 How many dead babies does it take to make a bottle of baby oil?   It depends on how hard you squeeze them.

1888 2018-03-23 19:40:09 If this vol continues and oil stays “firm” suddenly MLPs and their big yields could become safe haven oddly (nothing surprises me) enough $amlp at 9%
1889 2018-03-23 19:40:05 Th there is nothing here I haven't had, surprisingly. I'm about the least picky person on earth though... 
Also, some Japanese grills serve amazing liver. They use a sweet sesame oil to season it and it really cuts the mild bitterness to zero. Worth trying at least once.
1890 2018-03-23 19:40:05 Once you're south of Lawrence Kansas, the oil and gas thing still dominates the thinking if not the economy.
1891 2018-03-23 19:40:02 How do we know who's using sustainably sourced Palm oil and who isn't?

1897 2018-03-23 19:39:34 i’m going to switch to cannabutter instead of using oil. feel my product will be way more potent.
1898 2018-03-23 19:39:24 No Owen, you speak up for yourself only. As a neo liberal blairite, your political career comes first and last, above anything that is good for the Labour Party. Your links to big pharma at the expense of the nhs isn't forgotten, you truly are a snake oil salesman
1899 2018-03-23 19:39:23 There is also loads of Palm oil on the beach between the Claremont pier and Kensington gardens. Reported to coastguard yesterday.
1900 2018-03-23 19:39:03 So many junk fool I love has palm oil. I give in sometimes 
1901 2018-03-23 19:39:01 Did they have the aubergines in oil? Yummy
1902 2018-03-23 19:38:58 The era of coal, oil and gas is coming to a close. The city of Chicago must divest from fossil fuel stocks and bonds. Taxpayers should not be on the hook once the crash comes!  #divestchi @kurtasummers @ChicagosMayor @EdwardMBurke @33rdward @45thWardChicago
1903 2018-03-23 19:38:23 I find so ironic that as Montreal dumps millions of tons of sewage into their local waters there is no kind of protests going on there. Oh yeah I forget they wouldn't be paid by special interest groups like American oil companies. HYPOCRITES!!!
1904 2018-03-23 19:38:15 It's car oil and apparently it's really toxic so we are really worried about him.

1906 2018-03-23 19:38:09 I just got sucked into a convo with a very argumentative closed minded woman on the discussion on the benefits of CBD oil.

Her initial FB response was argumentative anyway and I know that I should have listened to @rickygervais and left it but alas.......

She's now blocked 
1907 2018-03-23 19:38:08 Miracle village pple wanted to hold him down with d mouth blowing thing dey dunno dere's an oil on his head #bbnaija
1908 2018-03-23 19:38:03 Eat healthy 75% of the time, exercise regularly. Do that and most people will be okay. But Americans value food with excess. More sugar, more fat, more oil, more food. And thus, more fat.
1909 2018-03-23 19:38:00 Aight this lemongrass essential oil diffusing is literally smelling like froot loops again and imma die
1910 2018-03-23 19:37:59 Didn’t you publicly taunt anyone who would dare mention a correlation between oil and sp over last year or so?
1911 2018-03-23 19:37:58 I hope it's minor and won't keep him out for long!
1912 2018-03-23 19:37:54 i really need oil.
lowkey going crazy
1913 2018-03-23 19:37:39 The America oil memes are the best memes.
1914 2018-03-23 19:37:39 Bio oil is everything

1921 2018-03-23 19:36:19 Once again you fall back on identity as if you knew what mines was or that there aren’t thousands of diverse people fed up with phonies selling snake oil instead of doing the real work that needs to be done like proper sociological research and objective analysis of issues.

1923 2018-03-23 19:36:01 Some users are more destructive than others. I'm not putting dog owners in the same league as multinational mining or oil companies but in my back yard they have significant impact on the birdlife & environment, & on the ability of others to enjoy the reserve without harassment
1924 2018-03-23 19:35:41 All these massive oil spills in our oceans and yet we continue doing it without giving the companies big enough consequences so they can research and invest in renewable clean energy  #WaterPollution
1925 2018-03-23 19:35:35 Cooking oil as lotion is abit too much 
1926 2018-03-23 19:35:15 Was just reading about vinegar with olive oil. I was brought up around turps, can't stand the smell of it, but I will take two thirds of your advice.
1927 2018-03-23 19:34:59 I DONT HAVE SPRAY OIL WHAT

ALSO IM SORRY WE DONR COOK COMPLEX FOOD IN THIS HOWUSE
1928 2018-03-23 19:34:53 I heard similar stories to yours. I guess it doesn't work for everyone. some get allergic reactions. for me coconut oil works great & the no poo thing cleared my psoriasis.

1932 2018-03-23 19:34:09 At this point, the train solution is prolly no longer accepted as a viable solution for the transportation of oil due to the frustration wrought. Piping is of course a valid and viable solution especially since the distance is close enough and materials are available.
1933 2018-03-23 19:34:05 Is really look good for primer because is light and don't have the oil shine texture #contest #cicacream @influenstervox @lorealparisusa
1934 2018-03-23 19:34:04 It is very very foolish to leave oil or gas in the ground & not monetize it. If Canada doesn’t sell its oil or gas someone else will. It’s economic suicude & irrelevant climate-wise!! Canada is an energy giant and it’s unwise to prevent it @jkenney @RachelNotley @jjhorgan
1935 2018-03-23 19:33:36 I spend too much money on my face. So a facial scrub, some cream from Sephora cos my T-zone is only but at the same time dry?!? And coconut oil cos my chin and neck gets dry cos of facial hair. It’s too much. Wish I had nice skin 
1936 2018-03-23 19:33:27 Coming back to the present. Who will provide the jobs of the future when our oil industry is in decline? Our young folk will need jobs, careers, not lives on the dole while others get rich from fishing our waters.

1942 2018-03-23 19:32:50 Man I used to have to explain all the shit wrong with my old car when I got a oil change I started just doin it myself
1943 2018-03-23 19:32:49 bolton would let trump take the oil, his critique rested more on the cost to America than on anything else and plunder would justify them to him. people have fundamentally mistaken what his position is.

1947 2018-03-23 19:32:22 A good time is when you go to the doctor and worry about getting weighed because you’ve turned your body into an oil drum full of cake. Then it turns out you’re still just as far as you were a month ago so hey: free cake

Dont worry about that oil.we feed the world put a strangle hold on the food & watch them   line up..."FACT"!!

1950 2018-03-23 19:32:08 When your housemate asks me: “what oil do you want your omelette cooking in...and you say Olive, and he pops around the corner and says, “nah mate, you don’t want that...it’ll taste like Popeye’s dick”
#TooFunny
1951 2018-03-23 19:32:06 We must do both. It is foolish to leave oil or gas in the ground & not monetize it. If Canada doesn’t sell its oil or gas someone else will. It’s economic suicude & irrelevant climate-wise!! Canada is an energy giant and it’s unwise to prevent it @jkenney @RachelNotley @jjhorgan

1960 2018-03-23 19:31:01 I just paid $50 for a haircut and beard oil and cream. But my beard is so soft I can’t stop touching it.
1961 2018-03-23 19:30:51 I have sensitive skin too and I use it with ACV and tea tree oil. You can feel your face pulsating and your face will be red after for 15-30 minutes so do it at night or when you’re not going out lol

1965 2018-03-23 19:30:25 32 thousand retweets of that snake oil salesman bullshit.  all it was was an instant poll.

1968 2018-03-23 19:30:15 Retweeted PepsiCo (@PepsiCo):

We remain committed to transparency and have now published the list of suppliers and mills in our palm oil supply chain. See it here:
1969 2018-03-23 19:30:14 Coconut oil 
1970 2018-03-23 19:30:13 Tung oil.
1971 2018-03-23 19:30:08 I think they're talking about how easily people can be convinced with the snake oïl - I've even seen references to 'vulnerable voters' - which begs the question (to me at least) should we be proven to be of sound mind b4 we get to vote?
1972 2018-03-23 19:29:55 My cat has come home covered in oil and has been trying to lick it off. We are rushing him to the vets with him crying so much in his cat box and it's the most heartbreaking sound I've ever heard.
1973 2018-03-23 19:29:45 aloe vera and castor oil are literally the solution to every problem

1975 2018-03-23 19:29:23 I'll not waste any more money on poetry competitions (fees rising like oil prices) until I become very good at this game. I read shortlists and think, eh?
1976 2018-03-23 19:28:57 Have you suffered from insomnia before? Try lavender oil. It helps relax you.
1977 2018-03-23 19:28:43 I think you will be proven right soon. But for now, oil is totally outperforming XLE.
1978 2018-03-23 19:28:42 Had oil on my hands and rubbed my eye while I was driving...good for me.
1979 2018-03-23 19:28:34 I'm fortunate to have lived mostly on the coasts where people are a bit more diverse and educated. I found most people understood the wars were about oil and not WMD's.

1984 2018-03-23 19:27:56 The irony of the oil marketing ‘fan appreciation’, and utilizing a photo of 95% awful players. #soenticing
1985 2018-03-23 19:27:49 Good. Oil and gas get billions in subsidies. And I'm fairly sure that shale production is extremely environmentally destructive. The oil industry doesn't need or deserve defenders.
1986 2018-03-23 19:27:44 There are NOT to many on the range..get out of your 'scripted' BLM textbook..same old stuff (propaganda)..More Wildhorses in holding facilities than in the wild..That's a fact. By whose standard do you decide their removal? Profitteers, cattle & oil mogals of course #animalabuse
1987 2018-03-23 19:27:36 I need my brakes changed and an oil change...lol well I’ve been needed both like I REALLY need it now.
1988 2018-03-23 19:27:28 Seafood is a renewable, forever food resource. Oil is not. I'm voting for protecting our food  - no to more tanker traffic, more spills, more devastation.
1989 2018-03-23 19:27:24 After oil is found,  it's very profitable. Finding it though, that bankrupts more than it enriches. Even major oil companies farm out risk to JV. I actually slightly agree with you. Canada should invest in proven deposits and use the revenue to fund social programs including RE.
1990 2018-03-23 19:27:09 Tramp of these Saudis are scaring you to scare your country and put it in your oil tanker.

1993 2018-03-23 19:26:53 Competing against free associated gas from oil plays. Not good....
1994 2018-03-23 19:26:51 Walmart doesn’t have shorter checkout lines, and their cashiers have a hard time making change. Then again Whole Foods sells overpriced food and snake oil while actively fighting science and the poor by campaigning against GMO’s.

They’re both horrible companies in their own way.
1995 2018-03-23 19:26:35 We could have had their oil and taken on their debt to add to our own, just like Congress likes to do!
1996 2018-03-23 19:26:06 Tea tree oil is really good for breakouts, drying em out but only when diluted so I use water when I do add it in the mask not acv

2007 2018-03-23 19:24:32 @realDonaldTrump 
The congress leadership stabbed you & the people in the back. Rubs will lose house & senate. The only way to stop your agenda. Nothing else working. The swamp paid off to give up control to stop you.
Check out McConnell deal with China. Ryan deal with big oil.
2008 2018-03-23 19:24:17 Damn it’s crazy Molly causes people to cut down trees for oil, and the trees that produce the oil are almost extinct. 
2009 2018-03-23 19:24:17 My thoughts exactly. But us Oil fans don't have much to cheer for, so part of the fan base really just wants a "win"
2010 2018-03-23 19:24:06 I'm blessed that I found cbd oil for $25.00 for 9 ounces! Otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford the exorbitant amount most charge. Anyone can contact me if they're interested in getting some. It's available both to USA and Canada.
2011 2018-03-23 19:24:04 I'm told that oil of peppermint helps with nausea.....not that I'm a mom, or anything....:)
2012 2018-03-23 19:24:01 If you want it to be more crispy, you should cook it in a bit of oil, as opposed to just heating it up.
2013 2018-03-23 19:23:58 Please help stop the flow of oil, shift to renewables. Toxic Chems in agri business are oil based. Genetic mutations are occurring, who is minding the fallout. Who is going to stop the madness. Enough is enough!
2014 2018-03-23 19:23:50 The NDP were given a poor hand by decades of PC mismanagement, as well as the drop in oil prices in 2014, before the election.
2015 2018-03-23 19:23:45 My new shop/studio/garage has an oil pit in it.  Need suggestions on how to best fill it/drain it/ cover it up?
2016 2018-03-23 19:23:39 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
2017 2018-03-23 19:23:38 I agree however we can’t cut any ties with Iraq. The whole mess has been created over ours and America’s foothold in the Middle East regarding oil. That’s what it’s all about no more no less.
2018 2018-03-23 19:23:33 So I went to @meijer and @Walmart for a specific brand of oil filter ( @Purolator ) and they no longer carry them. I've sworn by them for 15 years. Tried the @Mobil1 extended performance, and boy does it feel smooth. Nothing you did #Purolator just had to use what's available.
2019 2018-03-23 19:23:31 But clearly what's happening now we're as a citizen are happy why because, free entry and exit assuming they are stealing our oil  how can we see? If they are bringing bad things to our country how do we see? They are so many questions
2020 2018-03-23 19:23:28 It’s all about balance I find. I order dominoes but also drink golden milk tea and cook with coconut oil and drink apple cider vinegar. An occasional cola with my veggie plate.
2021 2018-03-23 19:23:26 The countries do. Some countries have assets like gold and solver but it includes other assets a country has like oil, natural gas, diamonds, and other kinds of assets so their money is backed, not just a piece of paper backed by nothing
2022 2018-03-23 19:23:26 It wasn't in Venezuela or Saudi Arabia.  THEIR oil is okay. 
2023 2018-03-23 19:23:02 Taking the kids! 
2024 2018-03-23 19:22:56 Buffalo Bill made a ton of money from Snake Oil rodeos, so that might tell you something about his sales pitch :)
2025 2018-03-23 19:22:46 Historically, has Russia ever been conquered and or occupied. No. The Russian people and their military is very resilient as is the USA & its ppls.  China was taken by Japan easily. Pls no hate mail from my Chinese friends. China is cutting oil & arms deals with Moscow.

2036 2018-03-23 19:21:00 Farm to market roads allover Cameroon can solve this problem. This is money that aught to go to the farmers now going to a foreign country. What is 100,000 tons of palm oil that it can't be produced in Cameroon?
2037 2018-03-23 19:20:50 The high failure rate is why oil isn't nationalized. Very easy to say after its found. But finding it is expensive and best left to the private sector. That is my point. Countries like Venezuela nationalize oil. And fail. Subsidies and fuel taxes for consumers are very different.
2038 2018-03-23 19:20:26 My ex wife clued me into it, but I want to cook everything in coconut oil. I used it to brown the beef for my chili and damn.

2045 2018-03-23 19:19:39 FFS the founder of Planned Parenthood had a program called the “Negro Project”; all about removing those “undesirables” from society.  And the black community continues to live in ignorance and blindly support a political party and organization that advocates their deaths. 
2046 2018-03-23 19:19:16 Tendría que vender empresas viables, si las tiene, y con ese dinero levantar la deuda de Oil Combustibles, que pareciera la mas apremiada. Así se evitaria el despido de los trabajadores. Humilde opinión.!
2047 2018-03-23 19:19:01 Terrible memories of Tartan Bitter in a dimpled glass and Watney's six-pint party cans, like fancy oil drums.
2048 2018-03-23 19:18:58 For sure. I just don't think it meets our strategic needs going forward, is incoherent given how much Saudi Arabia has done elsewhere to inflame other conflicts/situations we then involve ourselves in, and is bound to change with our growing role as an oil exporter.
2049 2018-03-23 19:18:53 Both lawyers are the reason people hate lawyers.They are attention whores and money grubbing corrupt snake oil salesmen that manipulate the law to free rich criminals.I've seen the 2 operate for years.But that's all that will represent him,scum

2055 2018-03-23 19:17:34 Green Party Leader and noted badass @ElizabethMay was just arrested by the RCMP on Burnaby Mountain.

Stocks down, crude oil up.

Repeat of 2008. Only that in 2008 oil was at $120, not $65.

Then it collapsed to $40. Which mean this time would collapse to....... $5?

2064 2018-03-23 19:16:46 We're still going to burn oil for the forseeable future; "green energy" just isn't ready. The only difference is that we will import foreign (unethical) oil instead of using our own. Bizarre.

2079 2018-03-23 19:15:17 Tell all @realDonaldTrump cabinet robber barons that the American taxpayers want are money back. Start w/Mnuchin & $$s spent on air fare. Pruitt same, Zinke same as well as money making from traditional stealing public land for oil & minerals.
2080 2018-03-23 19:15:16 #ableg #bcpoli @jjhorgan The oil sands were hurried in the ground in the first place. All "tailings" will be burried far enough from rivers for safety. Grasslands will be planted. New bufallo pasture for future generations.
2081 2018-03-23 19:15:16 Dude, they don't boil people in oil anymore, that's cruel and unusual punishment.
2082 2018-03-23 19:15:09 olive oil is good on them too

2086 2018-03-23 19:14:28 also, an abundance of fish oil and Meloxicam
2087 2018-03-23 19:14:24 Hi Adele, I'm really sorry about this! Can I ask if you greased the paper with butter/oil before placing the pizza in the oven? As with any material, there is the potential for food to stick without the presence of oil/butter. (1/3)
2088 2018-03-23 19:14:17 The state of “Take The Oil”, I suspect.
2089 2018-03-23 19:14:15 With a few drops of tea tree oil too 
2090 2018-03-23 19:14:10 #OOTT Trump moves oil up against fundamental facts,. FOGLOL,.
2091 2018-03-23 19:14:09 Try calendula oil or cream...it has less baggage than dope oil.
2092 2018-03-23 19:14:06 I proudly live in a sanctuary state.  What mass murder/domestic terrorist has been “harbored” in sanctuary cities/states?
2093 2018-03-23 19:14:00 Bulls used to tell us for years to follow The Price. Now they keep blabbering about spreads, oil, gold, Latin America - Anything But the price
2094 2018-03-23 19:13:24 once again checking in on the health of all who were not going to see $40 oil in their lifetime again.  BRENT > $70/bbl     meanwhile capex investment is -$1trn from before the oil pullback 2yrs ago.
2095 2018-03-23 19:13:22 Crash and ameliorate attacks against it has more features than the gf we should move to avoid getting an oil change for DAYS
2096 2018-03-23 19:13:05 Through the end of the month: $15 off High Mileage or Full Synthetic oil changes. Get your car ready for spring!
2097 2018-03-23 19:13:02 Ink cartridges are made of oil, around 3.5 quarts to be exact. A quart is somewhat more than a liter, which is a major motivation behind why printer ink is so costly all through the world.
2098 2018-03-23 19:12:58 I fully support this protest. These brave souls are standing up to the destroyers of our planet! You evil oil execs and workers don’t have a clue as to the power of protesting. We can easily run our society on love and pixie dust. I’ll be honoring these hero’s in my next speech!
2099 2018-03-23 19:12:50 Old engine oil <3
*go to take a picture of my current beer collection*
2100 2018-03-23 19:12:43 I know it's still the bleak midwinter because the coconut oil is as solid now as it was in January.
2101 2018-03-23 19:12:42 America is capitalist.
Invading a country to redistribute its oil resources would be an act of International Socialism.
Capitalism and Socialism are incompatible.
Therefore, America does not invade other countries to redistribute their resources.
2102 2018-03-23 19:12:40 so the squeaky wheel gets the oil. cool.

2105 2018-03-23 19:12:12 a majority of libraries in america look nothing like this because we couldn't give a fuck less about our educational system theres no oil or profit involved, most libraries here are colorless lifeless areas no one cares to really go to anymore

2108 2018-03-23 19:11:45 What do you mean by sustainable palm oil especially with regard to deforestation?
2109 2018-03-23 19:11:25 So italian theme night turned into making homemade pizza & having ciabatta bread with oil and balsamic vinegar dip to having greek salad and tzatziki with our pizza. So its an Italian/Greek themed dinner tonight 
2110 2018-03-23 19:11:14 Car is fixed, new tires, oil is changed, the guys fixed my Bluetooth & now it’s getting a hella good hand wash. #productive 
2111 2018-03-23 19:10:52 What in the heck is going on with @FirestoneAuto ? Store 026492 in Dallas does an oil change, can't figure out how to reset the sensor, then attempts to let the customer leave without telling then they couldn't reset it. #WhatAreTheyHiding

2113 2018-03-23 19:10:42 Who sell a quality, affordable CBD oil - Recommendations please.
2114 2018-03-23 19:10:32 Most oil exploration companies fail. That is why they sell a license to companies willing to do the work. There are no guarantees of economical oil. Canada would go bankrupt exploring. Instead the risk is sold to entrepreneurs. Capitalism vs ... drum circle economics.
2115 2018-03-23 19:10:26 People pray for cake. Then once God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen.
2116 2018-03-23 19:10:20 Legit every car place I take my vehicle they call me by “adrians daughter”  then they’re like “ohh we’re charging you for two oil changes you’re paying for his too” like whaat

2120 2018-03-23 19:10:05 Though widely regarded as a useless product in the wild west snake oil can be very effective when used on rattlesnakes. (via @ArthurFooksake)
2121 2018-03-23 19:09:55 My cars cleaned, gassed up, oil changed an packed to go
2122 2018-03-23 19:09:52 My new oil tastes like a root beer float and it’s literally spectacular
2123 2018-03-23 19:09:46 Lol no I have no use for Butanol so I have none. I tried to replicate woelen's synthesis of Isopropyl Hypochlorite via mixing glacial AcOH with a bit of water and adding some iPrOH, followed by addition of Bleach. Nothing happened, and I got no oil like was said on the forum. >:(
2124 2018-03-23 19:09:21 I don't know if you've heard (I imagine moonlighting as an AirBnB host  is busy work) but there was a crash in the price of oil.  It may be  "best" for your self-interests, but not for the majority of Albertans. #abpoli #yyc
2125 2018-03-23 19:09:16 Loved that Oil Rig!

2132 2018-03-23 19:08:22 This. We should be out there helping them get rid of those 55-gallon drums of snake oil they all have sitting around collecting dust.

2139 2018-03-23 19:07:50 There is Olive Oil in this hair dye conditioner and my scalp is on F I R E!!!!
2140 2018-03-23 19:07:16 I tried to look up techniques for hot oil massages and only porn sites came up 
2141 2018-03-23 19:07:14 $WTI #Crude #Oil Prices Settle at 8-Week Highs on Prospect of Further Output Cuts.
2142 2018-03-23 19:07:07 Any specific reason you’d go ultrasonic vs nebulizer? I see that the latter doesn’t use water so is more potent so you go through oil much faster, and these little bottles are pricey!
2143 2018-03-23 19:07:06 PTSD, suicides, homelessness, difficulty securing health care, and the families and children left torn apart and orphaned... war would repeat the endless cycle of loss. No one wins except the man that goes home with what he calls the spoils of war. In this case, that is oil.
2144 2018-03-23 19:07:04 Is no one going to ask about the olive oil?
2145 2018-03-23 19:07:02 My guttate psoriasis has come back (two years since the last time) and I’m just going big on coconut oil every day! I smell like a stir fry :)

2150 2018-03-23 19:06:47 Getting my car oil changed, and they have MTV on and I seriously hate it now.
2151 2018-03-23 19:06:45 Economics rule here. The differential in oil price is the culprit.

The profit margin at $36+/- is so low there is no benefit to refining the extra product in AB due to the volume of export required to offset the lower revenues.

At $65+/- world pricing everything changes.
2152 2018-03-23 19:06:39 People seem to forget that Trump has always operated this way.  He sells snake oil and always has.  Bankrupt a busiess?  get a bail out, default on bills and then blame the other guy.  This is how he rolls but idiots voted for him anyway.
2153 2018-03-23 19:06:34 Plan on it, I’ll be taking a buddy who doesn’t get to go much.

2157 2018-03-23 19:05:57 You guys should try bleaching your palm oil with a little coconut oil. Thank me later
2158 2018-03-23 19:05:52 Hey brah. Your Don the Con just signed the omnibus spending bill despite threatening to veto it. Another "win" for TRUMPettes!! Sad!!

2160 2018-03-23 19:05:42 My cat has been on cbd oil for about 5 months now. Her coat is extremely soft and shiny. She barely sheds. Isabella is not quite 3 years old so no ailments I'm using it for. Just for  overall well-being. Her disposition is exceptional.
2161 2018-03-23 19:05:36 thats great! more people need to understand what simple lifestyle changes at home can be done to have far more impact than just palm oil. Example: the dairy industry is one of the worst, the exploitation of these cows are horrendous, calves are stripped from mothers for cheese...
2162 2018-03-23 19:05:30 Google:

2163 2018-03-23 19:05:29 Wow for once I’m the person at the oil change place who knows more than the person next to me
2164 2018-03-23 19:05:16 That’s exactly right( its supply and demand) and trump was going to open all federal land for oil exploration but the oil companies weren’t interested. Heard all the time (Fox) that 10 million good paying jobs we’re ready if the government (Obama) would just turn them loose.
2165 2018-03-23 19:05:09 รอเลยยย ไปคอนฯรวมไหมค่าา
2166 2018-03-23 19:04:52 so over bleeding veggie burgers, it's just beet juice and palm oil or coconut oil
2167 2018-03-23 19:04:51 Nothing better than loads of olive oil on a pizza 
2168 2018-03-23 19:04:36 $USD has more downside left. OIL $USO will be moving higher. Almost at 3 year high.
2169 2018-03-23 19:04:36 I’m sitting at the car dealership, getting my oil changed watching HGTV. All the while Susan is complaining about the 700k house veranda she’s moving to in Hawaii being too small...I’m sitting here excited about free coffee and trying to decide between Doritos or GoldFish #HGTV

2178 2018-03-23 19:03:46 Rubbed in coconut oil obviously
2179 2018-03-23 19:03:34 Oil has a purpose underground. As it's used in machines, oil eases the shifting of the tectonic plates. Without a balance in the underlying structure, the land faces seismic activity, oil swells, and sinkholes.
2180 2018-03-23 19:03:30 I doubt we have 3 years.  With this Republican sell out, I imagine they will lose Congress this fall.  If they lose Congress, Dems will finally be able to impeach Trump although he's done nothing illegal.
2181 2018-03-23 19:03:24 i'm on board, it's a bummer that the oil companies probably aren't going to have to pay for it though
2182 2018-03-23 19:03:24 I like oil paints.
2183 2018-03-23 19:03:16 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
2184 2018-03-23 19:02:55 If you make that soup, i suggest adding a dash of olive oil, worcestershire and soy to finish it off, along with some crumbled-up crackers. maybe a little grated parmesan.
2185 2018-03-23 19:02:50 Try some water based ones... uh I mean the non oil based ones! Gomen I’m not too familiar but the one I’m using now is non oil and maybe u could take a look... o.o
2186 2018-03-23 19:02:33 Is it a solid? Is it a liquid? Is it healthy? Is it bad for you? Is it an oil, or a dairy product? Why is ‘smooth as butter’ an expression when it’s usually all gloppy?
2187 2018-03-23 19:02:28 My car needs TLC. It’s time for an oil change and I should really get my tires checked out. 
2188 2018-03-23 19:02:23 overall, great, but I disagree with their comments on organic and GMO. Additionally, the line “GMOs” are mostly present in junk food, which you want to avoid anyway" is interesting when earlier I am told canola oil is good. The majority of Canola is genetically modified.
2189 2018-03-23 19:02:11 Trump hasn't though through that if you build walls around your country, the rest of the world can just fill it with boiling oil, or send in the wolves, or just cut the cables, and solve that problem.
2190 2018-03-23 19:02:06 And working on a syrum to maintain sugar and oil levels for average of 10 years
2191 2018-03-23 19:02:04 And a digital evangelist / data-oil-salesperson would want to tie that in with dubious ad-serving #creepy
2192 2018-03-23 19:02:04 Sir, I know you’re just trying to be helpful. But look at my car. Do you think that this is the first time I’ve had to put oil in it? I can handle this very simple task, thanks
2193 2018-03-23 19:01:56 3 members of my family have asked what’s that awful smell. It’s me. I’ve tipped clove oil on my hands and can’t get it off. This is now apparently my new personal smell
2194 2018-03-23 19:01:45 I use Dr. Bronner's coconut oil and soaps. And vinegar is my main cleaner. Bonus: Love how soft the towels feel when washed with vinegar.
2195 2018-03-23 19:01:33 Dr. Kari Franson, associate dean at the University of Colorado School of Pharmacy, says dabbers are "getting 80, 90 percent THC in a concentrated oil. And when they smoke it, they're taking in 600-to-800 milligrams of THC."
2196 2018-03-23 19:01:33 Bio oil also helps a ton!!!
2197 2018-03-23 19:01:22 Is the eggshell oil or water based?

"Ooh, there's an oil paint set here from the brand I like. How much is this?" ... .... "... $50. Nope. Nopenopenopenope. Nope. Amazon is cheaper."
2201 2018-03-23 19:01:08 BHO is butane hash oil. #MoxieWay #LetsGetBetter
2202 2018-03-23 19:01:02 Come on, I didn't say that AT ALL. Don't make me saw things I didn't. 
I was only speaking about palm oil because it was the topic. Okay ?! 
Of course slaughterhouses are bad for so many reasons, I know that, I'm a vegetarian.
2203 2018-03-23 19:00:59 Nut bars go home and educate yourself on real reason for climate change Hint or if you like a Pro Tip. Climate change is not caused by oil!!!
2204 2018-03-23 19:00:56 Will you do that by paying oil and gas companies to extract our resources?
2205 2018-03-23 19:00:44 Oil futures settle at an 8-week high
2206 2018-03-23 19:00:35 I hate when my phone won't recognize my finger because i have oil from chips like pls
2207 2018-03-23 19:00:25 Yes the present & foreseeable price of oil, cheaper onshore production and offshore Africa and Brazil are better investments by major companies. The one new area in the Gulf where there is interest (off Florida panhandle) has military activities & taken off table for FL governor.
2208 2018-03-23 19:00:22 i need some oil or something for my scalp

2211 2018-03-23 19:00:13 Their UECD model indicates coal fired generation at a higher price ($10) than Combined Cycle natural gas ($6) and oil & gas steam ($4).  However their results indicate increased CO2 emissions from a cheaper supply from coal for storage before 2025.  This doesn't make much sense.
2212 2018-03-23 19:00:09 Canola Oil?
2213 2018-03-23 19:00:08 yeah one gummy with CBD oil and your children are HOOKED FOR LIFE

2215 2018-03-23 18:59:54 So now #ucp is denying the oil recession of 2014-2016. Like it didn't happen. Are you going to deny the wildfires too? @UCPCaucus needs to stop lying and work on policy and criticism of the government based on truth, not denial. #ableg
2216 2018-03-23 18:59:53 Seems people put all the money into oil as 99 of the other 100 assets are falling. 
2217 2018-03-23 18:59:52 Do they still have that one ride where like the whole section of movie seats takes you into dinosaur land and it’s all about how fantastic big oil is for the whole world? I literally harrumphed throughout the narrative because it was so blatant.

2230 2018-03-23 18:58:28 @thelincolnite Swinderby - An oil tanker has hit a pot hole and crashed into a large drain/ditch. cranes are on site at the moment trying to pull it out. The pot holes were reported to LCC several weeks ago and they have said no action is required - some pot holes are 8in deep.

After we stickered their stores and sent 45,000 emails, Holland & Barrett decided to ditch krill oil products that were putting the Antarctic Ocean at risk. This is proof of how when we work together, we can make a huge impact."
2244 2018-03-23 18:57:00 This all again goes to creating conflict in the Middle East. This creates a oil shortage and excuse to remove sanctions after that you can run oil, run guns, run nuclear secrets!
2245 2018-03-23 18:57:00 How come MLPs have been getting hammered?   All of oil has to flow through that infrastructure at some point.

2248 2018-03-23 18:56:34 The oil companies have no need to drill anywhere. They need to find some occupation that is not destroying the environment in which we all live.

2250 2018-03-23 18:56:31 How do oil imports and the Canadian deficit impact investment into the future? How does the future meet today's energy demands? How much oil does Canada import daily? How much does that contribute to the deficit? How does Norway fund it's green tech and social programs?
2251 2018-03-23 18:56:28 so i understand correctly: palm oil is bad for environment, animals and our health. However, those who consume animal products daily have far less impact on those three things mentioned? I hate to break it to you but ALL 3 of those things are far more impacted by meat consumption

2261 2018-03-23 18:55:46 Poor you!  You need a very warm bath in Epsom salts and lavender oil to soothe you.
2262 2018-03-23 18:55:37 They aren’t anti big business at all. The firm cap on oil sands emissions is a massive benefit to large established players and will lock new smaller players out of the industry and allow the large companies to consolidate all the land at low cost because others can’t develop it.

2264 2018-03-23 18:55:26 Q5. Continue to resist expansion of leasing, it's facing tremendous bipartisan opposition & is going down.

2330 2018-03-23 18:47:42 GDP represents an ability to generate wealth, and is much less susceptible to things like market and technological changes, ie oil gluts and fracking technology.

2342 2018-03-23 18:45:59 En estos días un chavista decía que consiguió el litro de motor oil en 1.8 millones. Otro chaburro contento le dijo que lo consigió en 1.4 millones. Que agarró una ganga. Pero cuando costaba 9 bolos de los de antes era caro: chillaban y pataleaban.
2343 2018-03-23 18:45:49 I wish you peace, and objectivity. Happy Friday. I don't care about everything being electric. It's unobtainable for now and will be for some time.

2352 2018-03-23 18:44:54 Income per person is a poor metric when it is tied to values of assets, like oil, which makes up 60% of Qatar's GDP. Case in point: Venezuela, which sits on the world's largest oil reserves, yet still went into an inflationary spiral while suffering from Dutch disease.
2353 2018-03-23 18:44:47 Sometimes I think the #US not only wants to destroy #Syria, but also #Europe. And everything just for oil.

2355 2018-03-23 18:44:39 Venezuela is no longer a socialist country. The Meduro government has highly privatized the oil industry.
2356 2018-03-23 18:44:35 Y'all need to invest into some coconut oil
2357 2018-03-23 18:44:34 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
2358 2018-03-23 18:44:22 That argument would have more legs if xle would be following oil
2359 2018-03-23 18:44:19 @RicJ Oil can go up all day long but one things for  sure.. those 49 non producing wells they bought 3 weeks ago... still equals 0 barrels.
2360 2018-03-23 18:44:18 et encore c'était sur des monstres avec des stagger limit vraiment basses et avec des armes bien précises genre la SnS akantor
Sur MHXX tu pouvais monter à +60% avec Chaos oil et un d'affi et franchement je trouvais pas ça hallucinant mdr
2361 2018-03-23 18:44:15 Aye I really don’t need a nigga for shit I can’t believe I just checked my oil, made a funnel out of a water bottle, and put oil in my engine by myself 
2362 2018-03-23 18:44:15 Talk about moving the goal post: I’m old enough to remember gas lines from 1973 OPEC embargo that drove US for “energy independence”. Now US is 3rd biggest global oil producer because of shale and Zinke/Trump want to open 99% of US ocean for “energy dominance”? #exxonvaldez29
2363 2018-03-23 18:44:14 I spilled lavender essential oil all over myself and my work's floor, and I keep getting calls from a stranger who keeps calling me a bitch and I don't even know who is calling??? #ariesseason #helpme
2364 2018-03-23 18:44:11 The oil and gas industry lobby, led by the American Petroleum Industry, marshaled the opposition of the Republican majority.
2365 2018-03-23 18:44:09 Up with oil right to the great pipeline
2366 2018-03-23 18:44:04 And Chevron, along with 4 other oil companies (I think), admitted Climate Change is real.  Now it's time to start doing something about it.
2367 2018-03-23 18:43:58 OK
2368 2018-03-23 18:43:47 Oh my.. add oil

2372 2018-03-23 18:43:05 This is Berkeley Asphalt and the fire was at or near their 30,000 gallon tanks of oil kept heated to over 300 degrees. Neighbor's concerns about those tanks catching fire have been ignored by their Councilmember for decades. Abundant thanks to the BFD for a quick response.

2378 2018-03-23 18:42:30 You're an icon of desperate smears, Osman. Well done for your dedication to the snake oil industry. I commend you.
2379 2018-03-23 18:42:21 sur MHXX avec Chaos Oil c'était vraiment un gros boost d'affinité sans pour autant faire de l'arme un monstre de puissance, mais vraiment se plaindre des huiles sur MHGen/MHX je saisis pas trop

2385 2018-03-23 18:41:46 You slice it horizontally, but not all the way. It kind of opens on a hinge.

Then you layer in cold cuts, cheeses, lettuce tomato onion, maybe some salt pepper & oregano, some oil & vinegar.

Or you put in a few meatballs, some marinara, & melt mozzarella all over it. #chefkiss

2389 2018-03-23 18:41:35 @GovInslee VERY busy, signing bills to BAN Atlantic salmon pen farms, to sign oil spill prevention act, to sign bill helping Marbled Murrellet and to sign bill improving halibut monitoring & mgt. Now, if we can get him to breach Lower Snake River dams to save the orcas & salmon!
2390 2018-03-23 18:41:21 " Pastors " that sell water, oil, arm bands and selling things like a prophecy. . .PLEASE STOP !!!

2391 2018-03-23 18:41:20 trev just said i smell like a heating pad after you warm it up in the microwave....all i have on is coconut oil /:
2392 2018-03-23 18:41:04 And why cant these useless ****s on these cooking programmes dress vegetables. Bit of butter, oil, parsley, mint, back pepper, something like that. Whats the point in preparing some massive great piece of salmon then sticking three bone dry miserable fucking carrots next to it.

2394 2018-03-23 18:40:53 Wow bringing officials into it, City fans genuinely are embarrassing. You get abit of oil money and puff out your tiny chests
2395 2018-03-23 18:40:45 They will experience the consequences of breaking the law.  I just wish that the oil companies who left the mess from abandoning wells would experience the consequences of their actions.
2396 2018-03-23 18:40:33 Wrong, world consumption of oil is going up, we need to take advantage of this by having the ability to get our product to the world market.
2397 2018-03-23 18:40:33 Tune in now to #ExxonValdez29  chat -- @OurOcean's team of experts @sdhighleyman @hagfishfan @csraustin @GulfAction (unfortunately) are a wealth of knowledge about oil spill impacts and the long-term response needed.
2398 2018-03-23 18:40:30 You are correct, and I agree that would be the moral conclusion of my debt-free proposition. Most of my wealth is invested in my house and in shares, though, with cash just flowing through to oil the transactional wheels. Government debt is OK!

2405 2018-03-23 18:39:54 I love #doTERRAEssentialOils! I have a sore throat so I rolled on some of the OnGuard Touch rollerbottle I have with me over my throat and BAM it no longer hurts!

2406 2018-03-23 18:39:53 What future is that head of exxon? Or whatever its called today? Who in their right mind would vote for him besides the handful of coal and oil ceo’s getting dirt cheap mining and big ranchers getting free grazing and chemical companies allowed to dump toxins again?

2410 2018-03-23 18:39:07 A3. #OPA90 was passed just a year after #ExxonValdez29 & mandated double-hulled vessels, improved spill response approaches & made responsible parties for natural resource damages. However, Congress failed to act on reforms recommended by 2010 Oil Spill Commission.

2420 2018-03-23 18:37:54 March 22 appointment of John Bolton to head of NSA solidifies trend toward very hardline on Iran (and other countries). Last week's release of Tillerson was step one.  Oil prices move up March 23 on news.
2421 2018-03-23 18:37:51 Crude Oil contracts settle at USD 65.88/bbl up 2.46%. Saudis on 2019 production cut extension.
2422 2018-03-23 18:37:43 I swear he thinks he just knows everything. I think he buys his own snake oil...  only a fool would have this job and think he didn’t need anyone’s expertise. I wish he didn’t lie about hiring the ‘best people’. Sad!
2423 2018-03-23 18:37:42 I kind of assumed these places were like those stores that only sold olive oil or fancy salt or something - either they were fronts for something else, or the kind of stores that get incentives in college towns because they make the town look fancy to students' parents
2424 2018-03-23 18:37:34 #webbothits OR clif_high SEE, I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THAT ON 3-26 SUN-TZU STARTS TRADING OIL FOR YUAN. THIS MEANS THAT ITS THE END OF THE SHELL GAME FED RES FIAT CURRENCY. STOCK MKT, LOOK OUT BELOW!!

2427 2018-03-23 18:37:06 Things I want to try when I get money because I keep getting inspired with ideas by people I follow:

Paper crafts (Im not going to rip her designs, I want to do a few to frame my void art)
Oil painting-I'm a Bob Ross fan but I've never done it..
2428 2018-03-23 18:36:48 I don’t mind doing my oil change because Mayra and I get to chismear 
2429 2018-03-23 18:36:46 Thank you!  Whether oil prices are high or low, Alberta needs the best university system anywhere.  I'm so happy that we have a government that recognizes that.
2430 2018-03-23 18:36:40 2/2  But oil and gas from Alberta can be transported by rail and pipeline throughout Canada.  Shipped globally to fuel the refining process of the raw materials required to get the end products of Alternate Energy.  Which mostly at the moment is Asian coal fuelled refining
2431 2018-03-23 18:36:34 No, you're wrong: our robot overlords will need someone to polish their chassis and oil their bearings periodically, between the human hunts.
2432 2018-03-23 18:36:30 In many ways British Pakistanis are doubly dispossessed because Pakistan largely came out of elite interests within the region and that of British foreign policy to keep a handle on central Asian oil and to ensure divisions remain with a Hindu India. Then racism once in the UK.
2433 2018-03-23 18:36:30 sounds good, it does seem a lot heavier than what sweet almond oil would be like. maybe only a tiny amount on the redness will help.

2437 2018-03-23 18:36:18 #ExxonValdez29 Supporters say expansion will make us less dependent on foreign oil and will add jobs. Yet, we currently export half as much as we import! Offshore wind could add 40,000 jobs from GoM to NE by 2028 with steady job growth with a fraction of oil’s carbon footprint.

2439 2018-03-23 18:35:52 Russia is selling China the oil, OPEC is becoming less important.
2440 2018-03-23 18:35:41 But ISIS was already being wiped out by Syria and Russia. All the US bases are being built next to the oil fields so they can try and steal them from the Syrians. If the Military pulled out tomorrow ISIS would be gone in six months or less.
2441 2018-03-23 18:35:29 Thanks Susan for trying to explain this.
2442 2018-03-23 18:35:17 This hooters about to be oil  i don’t even care it’s not Wednesday  i needed these boneless wings 
2443 2018-03-23 18:35:17 Let me Prove Mnuchin is illegally manipulating this market. First, oil is up nearly 2 percent on fears of war. Anytime in the past when oil raises the market falls. NOT THIS time. Gold is up 1.50 as fear of war no affect on market. This proves Treasury is illegally buy
2444 2018-03-23 18:35:14 Who's that handsome guy 
2445 2018-03-23 18:35:13 Agreed. He should have "pulled a Reagan" and shut the place down and force the Dems to come to him...it was his only card and he folded. Sad day IMHO.

I use to be a barber. Believe me

I'll do the best edge up on u and a skin fade too
2447 2018-03-23 18:35:06 Spilled my oil and I’m soooooo pissed bruh
2448 2018-03-23 18:34:56 that's like saying my favorite car is the oil i put in my car to make it run.  no, my favorite car is the actual car
2449 2018-03-23 18:34:52 the price of oil tanked a few years ago. it might not rise for a long time. it would seem prudent to develop plans based on that likelihood
2450 2018-03-23 18:34:33 After all, our robot overlords will need someone to polish their chassis and oil their bearings periodically, between the human hunts.
2451 2018-03-23 18:34:31 You can definitely try!! I used coconut oil for a while, but in my experience I found it was a lot heavier and honestly not the best on my sensitive skin. While I didn’t end up with breakouts exactly my skin tone was still uneven and a lot blotchier. I preferred the sweet almond!
2452 2018-03-23 18:34:27 They’ll pay for the wall like Iraqi oil is paying for their, “liberation.”
2453 2018-03-23 18:34:27 The fakery is even more evident when you see the price of oil diverging higher than gold's gains. As though oil energy is irrelevant to mining gold....
2454 2018-03-23 18:34:25 $UCO $USO $UWT $SCO Oil is breaking out UCO new price target 34..
2455 2018-03-23 18:34:10 Arent y'all supposed to have *more* oil than the rest of us?

2464 2018-03-23 18:33:37 If you aren't paying for the service then you're the product. The #CambridgeAnalytica and Facebook scandal perfectly fits the contention of rebranding of surveillance units to social medias. Data is the oil of our future.

You keep me busy @Lustful_GG
2466 2018-03-23 18:32:56 Time to change the oil on the old Dodge. @bubbalou109 Can i borrow a few Stridex/ Oxy wipes?
2467 2018-03-23 18:32:49 $CL_F Oil still ripping… because Trump is likely to pull out of the Iran Deal & because Bolton is a War Hawk. I’ll elaborate in my Weekend Review Video.
2468 2018-03-23 18:32:42 Or even worse investing time in a snake oil methodology that has no impact on anything except entertainment :-)
2469 2018-03-23 18:32:41 Fun fact worth noting ahead of CNY oil contract launch: China already has CNY oil pricing, CNY swap, loan, or infrastructure/jv deals in place with oil exporting nations that account for over 90% of annual global oil net exports.
2470 2018-03-23 18:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

2475 2018-03-23 18:31:57 A3: Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. OPA90 requires tankers to have double-hull construction to lessen the chance of spills, and all large vessels to have oil spill response plans. #ExxonValdez29

However, with all those machines there is a ton of small fabirc debris and a probably certain amount of oil leaking from machines. If you get the cahnce to go to Lowell National Park in Mass. They have a very good exhibit.

2488 2018-03-23 18:30:43 Hands up all who think the oil industry wants to build a pipeline to lower gasoline prices in BC.

BTW, with the purported serious supply shortage that's causing prices to rise dramatically, has anyone heard of a station running out of gasoline in Washington State or BC?

2497 2018-03-23 18:29:23 They should be more concerned that eastern Canada is importing dictator oil over oil produced in their own country.

2501 2018-03-23 18:28:48 I HATE the infaturation with coconut oil as skin care & hair care though for real. 

Trends don't measure up against science. 

And science says IT SUCKS
2502 2018-03-23 18:28:45 That's because we are going to war, China will start using Petrogold to purchase oil and there goes the the dollar. Could be wrong but they are looking at Taiwan really close right now and we are now in a trade war which always brings on world wars if history has taught us anythg
2503 2018-03-23 18:28:43 USA invaded Iraqi knowing they will benefit over oil looting and they gave Iraq some loans for war reparations and tenders were awarded t US

2510 2018-03-23 18:27:46 @ramseyjtyler The active ingredient in "Orange Oil" used by some companies to control termites is d-limonene. Is this the same chemical as the chemical listed in your study as dipentene/limonene? (d-limonene is also the active ingredient in many "natural" degreasers.) Thanks
2511 2018-03-23 18:27:42 waaaatt, bibimbap is great in those stone bowls, and comes sizzling (the more expensive version), with sesame oil at the bottom. Then you have the crispy bits at the bottom. Also called nurungji
2512 2018-03-23 18:27:39 We are also by far the biggest oil consuming country in the world. Does the GOP give a hoot about that?  Didn’t think so.
2513 2018-03-23 18:27:37 now im tryna get an oil change and “we’ll be w you in 5 min!” has turned into 20

2521 2018-03-23 18:26:49 What a dumb tired argument. Yes we as a society are addicted to oil but we need to find a better way which definately means NOT EXPANDING the tar sands output and not destrying the beautiful inlet at Vancouver.
2522 2018-03-23 18:26:49 Starts with monetizing the internet. Personal data becomes the new oil, people the oil field. We are being tracked intimately, constantly. They are now blindly obsessed with it. All companies do this, increasingly. There isn't a defense.

2535 2018-03-23 18:25:36 Facts? How much oil does Canada import daily? How much arrives via tanker? How much does that contribute to the deficit? Are the emissions from oil tankers accounted for in Canada's GHG targets or are thy omitted? Are those tanker emissions dramatically more than cars?

2564 2018-03-23 18:21:56 Practically though, oil based cleansers for oily skin, it makes so much sense and helps so much. Also if your concealer is working and the right shade you don't always need foundation, just powder.

2569 2018-03-23 18:21:36 One comment I made while a witness in the BP trial was that wherever the oil went it had adverse effects-the judge nodded like he got it & that was the quote in the newspaper.  #ExxonValdez29
2570 2018-03-23 18:21:23 Not true, but if that's what you believe, fine. The SM is protectionism. Adds costs/tariff's to protect the EU. Once out those tariff's will be lower on a raft of things from food to oil.

2576 2018-03-23 18:20:36 Amendment 1 to HB 65 would replace the word “committee” with the word “commission”. The commission would be tasked with providing annual recommendations on low THC oil dosage, response to treatment and reactions of low TCH oil with other drugs.
2577 2018-03-23 18:20:26 #ExxonValdez29 We have implemented policies that make oil drilling safer. Exxon Valdez inspired the Oil Pollution Act. The BP disaster led to new offshore drilling safety rules. We have spared the Artic and Eastern Gulf of Mexico from oil drilling and its impacts.

2609 2018-03-23 18:16:37 Hi Jordan! The name 'Vegetable Oil' is just a generic name for oils that are derived from vegetables including: Rapeseed, Sunflower, Corn Oil etc. So that we are clear to our customers, we declare 'Rapeseed Oil' on.. 1/3

2612 2018-03-23 18:16:18 I actually think dispersants have a place to protect workers trying to control spill or sensitive shorelines, but only if used offshore. Have to carefully weight tradeoff between keeping oil off the surface vs. injecting more of int into ocean waters.

2621 2018-03-23 18:14:34 For sure!! Take, for example, the petroleum industry is suing a California town who made it law that you have to ask for a straw. This is a fight against the oil/gas lobby who control politicians!

2626 2018-03-23 18:13:53 My granny ran out of oil for her heating so she has to wait a few days until she can get more, apparently she's going to be "a frozen shite behind a bush" such a way with words Cath 
2627 2018-03-23 18:13:24 God is good. My fiancé just landed her dream career as an accountant in the oil & gas industry!
2628 2018-03-23 18:13:21 Gonna start using twitter again because the drama on here these days are always shit. We need someone to be spilling oil properly in the fire
2629 2018-03-23 18:13:19 oil change, bank, car payment..adulting sucks
2630 2018-03-23 18:13:09 Seeking help is sometimes enough. I knew that Dawn dishwashing liquid is the secret to getting grease and junk out of an animal’s fur or feathers but learned about oil baths. Olive oil I know has natural antiseptic qualities.
2631 2018-03-23 18:13:08 Aarrrggghhh .... more bloody unwanted oil!! When will this curse ever end????

2638 2018-03-23 18:12:30 Forget bro, you're lazy
2639 2018-03-23 18:12:27 Crude oil. China buys commodities and sells back products.
2640 2018-03-23 18:12:24 Metan full oil!!!!
2641 2018-03-23 18:12:16 Effect is same, in general, extraordinarily huge concentrations of natural products, many of which are toxic, but vary based on type of oil, temperature, & environment affected. If oil gets buried it sticks around a long time.

2645 2018-03-23 18:11:57 I think people want honesty not snake oil PR. To make top 3 paypoints the same is a sneaky way of not actually giving a pay rise at all...but appearing to on the news. And it’s not a pay rise if it’s a pay cut in real terms. The media have a duty to report this not the CCHQ line
2646 2018-03-23 18:11:36 I started giving him CBD oil last night which I hope will help with his inflammation, and I will give him melatonin to help with his abnormal sleep pattern. His IBD flare up is the biggest problem right now because nothing is helping. It’s extremely frustrating.
2647 2018-03-23 18:11:34 I did not know the dealership washes your car when you go get an oil change. My baby needed that 
2648 2018-03-23 18:11:07 Like the water system around the oil patch, which will be polluted for generations to come, contributing to diseases and shorter life expectancy!
2649 2018-03-23 18:11:05 Ryan's wife is a Democrat lobbyist. We're supposed to believe that he's a Republican.  I am so over these fools running the Congress.

2651 2018-03-23 18:10:59 the trump is an embarrassment, a disgrace, a fool.   
a bumbling nincompoop. a snake oil salesman of astronomical proportion.  a fucking moron.  and to call him a fool, nincompoop, snake oil salesman a moron is an insult to fools, nincompoops, and all the rest.

2654 2018-03-23 18:10:38 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
2655 2018-03-23 18:10:33 Sunday Night Open should be wild. Crush / oil share is raging / potential trade war with the largest importer of US BEANS.

2658 2018-03-23 18:10:13 700 Billion isn't to keep Americans safe because no one wants to attack you. This is propaganda BS to attack countries for their oil. Endless wars to fill the pockets of the rich nothing more.
2659 2018-03-23 18:10:10 (Note that I don't mean five-eyes countries haven't meddled with elections in the past--in the Cold War, to do propaganda attacks against Communists, or against Mosaddeq in Iran against nationalization of Iranian oil--but I mean of a CURRENT such conspiracy.)

2662 2018-03-23 18:09:55 Spring Break = NCAA BB, rotating tires on @BayBayMarie2 car, brakes on my car, athletic trainer coverage of CPG BB tournament @Wichitahoops , oil change and tire rotation on @Brayden_4_ truck. Time to go back to work! #dadsduties

2665 2018-03-23 18:09:43 I am absolutely FUMING and APPALLED at @CertasBusiness. You charged my 69 year old, disabled mother who is currently ill, £311 on 2nd March for her oil and still haven't delivered it. She has no central heating and no hot water as a result. I cannot believe your ineptitude.
2666 2018-03-23 18:09:42 #ExxonValdez29 Oil spills can affect entire marine ecosystems because all parts are connected. Sea turtles die of acute exposure if smothered or if they eat oiled prey. Less visible, but equally insidious impacts also occur. The BP disaster killed trillions of tiny plankton.
2667 2018-03-23 18:09:42 So proud that we do not use palm oil.. just great ingredients.
2668 2018-03-23 18:09:40 Interesting read, I think this appraisal could help oil more deals specially geos on outbounds.
2669 2018-03-23 18:09:34 As far as I'm aware, Al Gore is funded by grassroots organisations, not industrial interests. This is very different and important. Why is oil funding climate science?
2670 2018-03-23 18:09:32 Evidently her meds have either expired or she’s out of them. She needs to stop watching FAUX NEWS. Hannity is a snake oil salesmen like his daddy Don The Con. The US is in shambles because if this idiot and all his merry men and woman.
2671 2018-03-23 18:09:18 Bout to drop some cbd oil in my essential oil diffuser, see what happens.
2672 2018-03-23 18:09:17 Oil demand growth this century has been almost entirely from China. It has been flat in the West. As with coal the Chinese are working to reverse this, it’s now stalled, once it reverses watch the price of the marginal barrel plunge. As with coal.
2673 2018-03-23 18:09:16 Speaking of ratings- I will be visiting Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe, to see how she got the debate last night.

2679 2018-03-23 18:08:05 Coconut oil hasn’t been properly researched to conclude that it has any effect on satiety.However it has been shown to raise LDL “bad” cholesterol because it’s a saturated fat.There are healthier fats: mono & poly-unsaturated fats. Even those must be used sparingly (rda 2-3tbsp)
2680 2018-03-23 18:08:04 i thought you had to use the beard oil from the start because it's essentially useless if you can't get it onto the skin. i need a beard brush, there's viking style ones you can get that are made of humanely sources cow bone.
2681 2018-03-23 18:07:44 Use almond oil for scalp before take hair wash...Give a firm massage
2682 2018-03-23 18:07:41 Why do oil changes take so damn long
2683 2018-03-23 18:07:39 In a paper I'm reading, they administer hormones to mice using the peroral route. Hormone delivery vehicle: sesame oil nicely mixed with Nutella.
2684 2018-03-23 18:07:20 So many parallels to early 70s and now.

2685 2018-03-23 18:07:09 So basically treat them like an oil change?

2689 2018-03-23 18:06:24 @StarryEyedJoey Just wanted to thank you. I got my oil and candle earlier this week and they are beautiful and full of energy. I can’t wait to get really started with them 
2690 2018-03-23 18:06:21 Feel it. You can also always get a warranty too. Like $2.5-3k but that’ll cover any major issues, but won’t cover maintenance (brakes, oil changes, tires)
2691 2018-03-23 18:06:06 Hi Andrew! Looking forward to the chat about oil spills especially as the Trump administration is thinking about opening more waters to oil and gas drilling.
2692 2018-03-23 18:06:02 This is fun and games until that oil pops on your skin
2693 2018-03-23 18:06:02 given the lack of details beyond 3 years and a huge reliance on iffy factors (oil prices rising, pipeline built on time, no more economic slowdowns), one might question the "realistic" label
2694 2018-03-23 18:06:00 I use CBD oil for myositis muscle cramps in my arms, but cramps are cramps, right? Legal in Oregon/Washington.
2695 2018-03-23 18:05:43 I just screenshotted all of this so I can buy those things off amazon. This is exactly what I needed ahhh thank you for sharing this with me!! Just one question, would it be ok to use coconut oil instead of almond oil when my skin is super dry? I have combination skin and rosacea
2696 2018-03-23 18:05:06 I'm not sure ... a carbon tax will make NG and oil more expensive to use. A well insulated house converting from more expensive fossil fuels to electrical heating may become a better choice or at least a choice that is not as dramatic as with today's prices.

2717 2018-03-23 18:02:22 So Trudeau’s idea of fairness is a higher tax on gasoline in NB than Alberta even as NB’s 2030 emissions targets have been met early & Alberta is allowed to increase oil & gas sector emissions > 25%! 
Meanwhile we will pay some of CDAs highest power costs when we close out coal.

2765 2018-03-23 17:57:10 I see massive deflation in my commodity costs since Feb - some food oil commodities have dropped 15% in a month - I can’t see any inflation going forward this year - only deflation
2766 2018-03-23 17:57:08 Thanks. We are going to supercross tomorrow at Lucas Oil 
2767 2018-03-23 17:57:06 Not bad. Depending on your drivers manual, either 3,000-10,000 miles from your last oil change. But it’s best to do it every 3 months. You don’t want that shit turning black 
I had to flush my engine twice. $$$
2768 2018-03-23 17:56:52 One more thing president Trump if you don’t have a country worth protecting.What is the point Our kids get killed around the world for oil that wack jobs lie about.I could careless about those countries killing each other.Find another fuel and put them back into the Stone Age
2769 2018-03-23 17:56:34 It's all political theater in advance of the Alta election, but my concern is that it is stoking enmity between the provinces. Also, Alta seems to be defining its interests narrowly around being a producer of oil, which is going to make carbon regulation difficult.
2770 2018-03-23 17:56:33 Getting my oil changed: they ask me to turn on my lights, i don’t know how. They ask me to turn on my brights, i turn on the windshield wipers. Why am i like this

2772 2018-03-23 17:56:24 Park your cars and walk to work... if your going to punish Big Oil & Gas, go all in.
2773 2018-03-23 17:56:24 My daughter suffers too! I’m so sorry! Diffuse lavender oil to help calm and soothe. Peppermint oil on your temples, but it needs to be mixed with something like coconut oil or it’s to strong and will burn your skin. Hope you’re feeling better soon! 
2774 2018-03-23 17:56:22 Drink red wine; eat dark chocolate, vegetables, oatmeal, and olive oil; take naps & walks; laugh; avoid stress; do something you love every day -- these are the secrets to a long, happy, productive life.

2777 2018-03-23 17:56:07 “Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod & thy staff comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou annointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over”

2783 2018-03-23 17:54:54 I’ve used jbco in the past, but I’ll definitely look into horse oil. Thank you! 
2784 2018-03-23 17:54:54 no not yet they are still waiting for the right part to be delivered.. I also asked them to repair the oil leak witch apparently involves the trans or engine to be removed.. so that is another huge bill . but i can't ship it with the leak.
2785 2018-03-23 17:54:53 Oooh  at that last one. I did a horse oil sheetmask 3 days ago, and my skin is still loving it.
2786 2018-03-23 17:54:46 I JUST NEED MY OIL CHANGED & I HATE WAITING
2787 2018-03-23 17:54:44 Aint do a oil change and spent thousands in repairs dont sleep on that.
2788 2018-03-23 17:54:19 "with the next round of tariffs on the way, this time aimed at China, the trade war is not going away. Even if the U.S. oil and gas industry can avoid the worst with the steel tariffs, the measures targeting China could also result in blowback."
Remember #blowback? BADNews 4 ppl!
2789 2018-03-23 17:54:13 I suppose if he can’t make money off Russia oil sanctions not lifted, now Tillerson is out, let’s start a war, & have all your friends as contractors and fleece the government by changing $200 dollars for a fork for our soldiers to eat with?  Remember the real cost, life &blood

2798 2018-03-23 17:53:22 I love getting my oil changed because it gives me an excuse to sit in a super uncomfortable chair and watch HGTV for a bit.
2799 2018-03-23 17:53:08 @pallmannusa I'm looking at using the magic oil 2k in neutral for my floors but can't find what type(s) of oil are used - my son is allergic to some oils and I'm wondering if this is safe for him. Thanks!

2803 2018-03-23 17:52:47 Is this a joke? How much pollution did the Irish Republican Army cause over 50 years, and the water at the border totally polutted with oil laundering, causing foetal abnormalities and cancer, want me to go on?
2804 2018-03-23 17:52:43 Naw i just make it, slice your beetroot and fry in the pan with a wee bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar! So tasty! Doesnt take long cause youre only really heating it up

2823 2018-03-23 17:49:40 @CarolineHirons Have you replaced Ketrel with Differin to avoid those mineral oil breakouts? Is there any benefit from continuing both? Thanks in advance!

2825 2018-03-23 17:49:32 Spent the morning working on the farm, doing some Spring Cleaning. The entire mid morning/early afternoon at the mechanic's (Taylor is fine. She needed an oil change, washing, vacuum, and pillow talk) and just starting desk work. 3 clients & I'm letting myself touch the fiddle.
2826 2018-03-23 17:49:32 Though it was written later on that if saddam had merely invaded the oil field as opposed to sacking Kuwait City, the US wouldn’t have supported military action.

2829 2018-03-23 17:49:15 Let them break the system.  Usher in a new currency system. Wipe the debt. What do you expect from the bankrupty king? Spend while you can then chapter 13. No way we can pay that debt unless we become main producer of oil.

2831 2018-03-23 17:48:53 @RawBeautyKristi have you tried the new @elfcosmetics x @CSiriano lip oil?? I picked it up on Sunday and I cannot get enough. It smells like frosting but not super heavily so, it has a really good color but not too overbearing, and makes your lips feel like BUTTAH
2832 2018-03-23 17:48:33 That's fair but if you think of data as oil or a natural resource and you and me as miners of said resource, it makes a little more sense. 

Anyway it's my fever dream
2833 2018-03-23 17:48:04 Seems like #StableGenius slipped up HARD and said we’ve gotten OUR LAND back from ISIS, which likely means a John Bolton was hired to “Take The Oil”

2839 2018-03-23 17:47:19 (1) True! You cannot find evidence if you don’t take testimony from YOUR bad actors

(3) Clappers testimony will be proven correct when Mueller gets done w YOU
2840 2018-03-23 17:47:09 Bro i got 2 hours till works over, gotta take anna to work right after, go get oil changed, free bobby shmurda, hit the plug, feed my cats, find someone to go to the gym with, and then i can finally relax
2841 2018-03-23 17:47:08 Any chance? oil and ?? thanks.
2842 2018-03-23 17:47:02 But we need the oil that we didn’t get... and the wmds we didn’t find in Iraq...... and........ we destabilized Libya and introduced slavery there..... and....... I got nothing.
2843 2018-03-23 17:46:50 In '91 Kuwait was slant drilling Iraqi oil. Oddly that wasn't widely reported but it is not disputed. They had plenty of warnings but underestimated Saddam's willingness to act.

2849 2018-03-23 17:46:28 Made an amazing dinner last night. Had rainbow trout marinated in olive oil, thyme, basil and salt pepper on a bed of spinach and tomato with a balsamic dressing. Only cooked the fish on the skin side and it was fucking dynamite. Cheap as well
2850 2018-03-23 17:46:11 @Richzeoli @realDonaldTrump  We hired Trump to FIX the system not to oil it. 
2851 2018-03-23 17:45:59 There are already PLANTs: CBD oil, Kratom, MJ that have been STUDIED and found to improve PAIN.  BUT  #BigPharma cannot make money off of something unless #WeThePeople are #banned from growing/purchasing on our OWN!!

2853 2018-03-23 17:45:47 Is this the same John Bolton who wanted to nuke the whales and take their oil? Good to know Big Ambergris has some skin in the #MAGA game.

2866 2018-03-23 17:44:42 I use coconut oil for most everything including brushing my teeth.  Helped reduce irritated gums.
2867 2018-03-23 17:44:38 They fell apart last night...meh.
2868 2018-03-23 17:44:38 We absolutely do.  We also fight wars on the credit card to secure oil supplies in the middle east.  But the cars of the very near future will require zero fossil fuel and much less parking, because people wont own them they'll be an on demand service. No need for parking.
2869 2018-03-23 17:44:31 They would be happy in their own country if Obama and Saudis had not destroyed their lives and turned Yemen into a failed state. Why don't you ask Obama why he made that decision in 2015? OIL?
2870 2018-03-23 17:44:22 Come on..just like that..you're giving up? The left keeps fighting while conservatives take their by the clock breaks every couple of years to wail..
2871 2018-03-23 17:44:21 Because those damn vikings don't want to share the oil money.
2872 2018-03-23 17:44:16 DOUBLE neck oil ..... oh my WOW 
2873 2018-03-23 17:44:14 

2874 2018-03-23 17:44:11 Data is the new oil. There's a reason every single god-forsaken store in the world wants you to have their "store card." It's not to increase their business by 1% because you want that 1% discount. It's to gather consumer data. You are free to choose not to participate.
2875 2018-03-23 17:43:59 Stagflation. Seems to go hand-in-hand when there is a Trudeau in the PMO. Another full on assault against one of the biggest economic contributors to our economy. Oil.

2884 2018-03-23 17:43:23 I've followed the money, it leads to oil companies. The fact that you aren't willing to defend your "position" in public, but only behind a shell twitter, tells me a lot.
2885 2018-03-23 17:43:05 The black soap is a harsher soap but it dries out oily skin perfectly I could literally feel my skin cleaner than it’d ever felt. Like squeaky. And then if it starts to get too dry use the lavender. It’s soothing and calming. The almond oil is heavier for when it’s real dry. But
2886 2018-03-23 17:42:56 I need to run to the library today and I'm feeling energized and productive even though I woke up late so I'm going to take an hour to get ready. Shower. Fix my face. Oil and comb my beard. For 90 minutes being in public.
2887 2018-03-23 17:42:43 DREAMERS,TRUMP is trying to sell you some snake oil,be smart and don't buy it,democrats are unable to do anything at this time,they have no power,republicans won't let them do nothing.they can't even save MUELLER if republicans don't help.we will call for a revolution if fired.
2888 2018-03-23 17:42:42 Guess we’re taking the oil, John Bolton.
2889 2018-03-23 17:42:36  ... Geopolitics? Mon 26th March 2018, China launches what some call the ‘petro-yuan’, a gold backed yuan oil contract - guess who’s likely to be ‘early adopters’?  Iran  Venezuela  maybe Iraq  and Syria  - enter stage left the American Psycho!

2909 2018-03-23 17:41:00 Is this about paying too much taxes...or are you lobbying for pipelines in addition to your current job? That's like tearing a page out of the pro oil script book! #vanpoli #bcpoli

2920 2018-03-23 17:40:01 I thought it’d have a radiant finish too. It kind of gives you a lit from within typa look but it controls oil very well too. It’s one sneaky powder but so far I’m very highly impressed. I never thought I’d love any other powder that my Laura Mercier

2926 2018-03-23 17:39:08 How about you tell the world where you stand!

You support Saudi oil and ignore our own oil and economy. Why? Because the Saudi government donates royally to the Trudeau foundation..... 

Your government is full of criminals and should all be locked up!
2927 2018-03-23 17:39:06 Truly sad.  Of course, oil and gas exploration will, as always, be brought into the equation.
2928 2018-03-23 17:39:00 This won't kill the GOP.
2929 2018-03-23 17:38:58 Some even use that kind oil to tie him down with pussy
2930 2018-03-23 17:38:43 middle eastern nations for our air power against ISIS, we got them to increase oil & energy output to bring the price of energy down so Western Europe no longer had to worry about Russia cutting their natural gas off & allowing them to impose their largest sanctions on Russia.
2931 2018-03-23 17:38:37 Oil out of whack, with China opening a mkt, they will run price down to help them
2932 2018-03-23 17:38:19 Guess it's about time for an oil change that can happen next payday. Are they open on weekends?
2933 2018-03-23 17:38:17 The OIL boom is back.. Every restaurant is hiring, customer service SUCKS and ALL of a sudden 4  athletes are enrolling in small town USA.
2934 2018-03-23 17:38:14 I would cook it through first before letting it simmer. my fool proof way of getting moist chicken is to brown the outside in a little oil, and once you have a decent browning, add enough water to cover the chicken. bring that to a boil, then cover and set aside
2935 2018-03-23 17:38:12 "our oil"
2936 2018-03-23 17:38:05 @barondaytrading you looked at Amerisur baron. Extremely good value for a low cost oil producer!
2937 2018-03-23 17:38:02 Hate having to get an oil change cause I be here forever
2938 2018-03-23 17:38:01 @TuckerGoodrich where does olive oil sit on your list of n-6 seed oils to avoid?
2939 2018-03-23 17:38:01 Don't forget the ancillary goal of enhancing Russia's oil prices.

2947 2018-03-23 17:36:44 It helps if you are floating on oil.

2949 2018-03-23 17:36:29 I didn’t realize WV was growing and I don’t know the legal situation but CBD oil is a big market
It works well on old tobacco land
2950 2018-03-23 17:36:27 This man walked into the room while waiting for our oil change and goes “JESUS we need to change the channel I can’t listen to Trump” #mood
2951 2018-03-23 17:36:08 Unpopular take: I wish Epcot still had the Maelstrom ride instead of the Frozen ride. That thing had it all. Trolls, a backwards water slide, a mural of a massive oil rig, a movie no one watched & expensive sweaters.
2952 2018-03-23 17:36:00 updates from break: didnt dye my hair, didnt get a piercing, didnt get my oil changed,  didnt get my shoulder looked at, didnt eat pho, didnt go to paseo, didnt rock climb... shoot i didnt even watch buffy, but BOY did i see Kenzi (my great good doggo)

2958 2018-03-23 17:35:32 Well, Obama did go harder on Russia than most people know about. A huge part of Obama's retaliation was his organization with the middle eastern coalition to dump large amounts of oil on the market while increasing the amount the US produces in his 8 years by almost 100%...
2959 2018-03-23 17:35:13 I just wanna know when we are taking the oil.
2960 2018-03-23 17:35:01 Um, there is a upside to Nuking Middle East,,, with no oil All must look for a Alternative energy source. Heck of a way to learn a Lesson... But nothing is taken off the Table... It;s not how you play the game, it is who wins...

2964 2018-03-23 17:34:38 It's stranger for me growing up in the north east (Scotland) as all the jobs were pretty much oil & gas related.
2965 2018-03-23 17:34:31 This is the time of the year where I love eating kale everyday. Butter spray and coconut oil stays stocked this time of year.

2969 2018-03-23 17:34:16 I generally do not like you as president. I see you as just another oil tycoon profiteering off of our people.  But I do support you vetoing that bill. I got a chance to see the general synopsis of what is to come from it.. it is aweful.
2970 2018-03-23 17:34:02 gosh! me too....cute sgt bila hassan jalan cepat2 in that kundara?eh ke ape ntah jubah tu..hahahha n also the caption "mc oil & money" got me laughing like a crazy person

2972 2018-03-23 17:33:59 I’m really glad I brought my headphones to get my oil changed because our incompetent president giving a speech on the TV, and I’d rather not, thanks
2973 2018-03-23 17:33:49 He did say that we took back “our land” from ISIS, so oil must be next!

2980 2018-03-23 17:33:23 OK, as long as you guys take a row boat out to your offshore oil platforms.
2981 2018-03-23 17:33:16 I'm sick and by the rate of all the hemp oil and honey my dad wants to give me I'll only be waking up Monday morning.

2984 2018-03-23 17:33:03 Every time my grandma shows stroke signs the CBD oil seriously helps. Such a bummer these remedies aren't so easily available for other patients.
2985 2018-03-23 17:33:01 I forgot about the customer service in this area - free interior cleaning with oil change. Pulse they run out to meet you before you get out of your car.
2986 2018-03-23 17:32:59 But does Russia need oil anymore? I think they currently have a glut of it. We don’t particularly either...
2987 2018-03-23 17:32:55 “We just give them oil, coal, food and cash and they go away for awhile...Obama is stupid, he should have just asked what they wanted. Also North Korea will put up ALL the money for the casino licenses. Personally.”
2988 2018-03-23 17:32:38 Kentucky is growing hemp chiefly for CBD oil, it is definitely a cash crop. I saw the research station in Lexington
2989 2018-03-23 17:32:37 Yellow ochre is used for nearly everything in oil painting.  It’s amazing

2999 2018-03-23 17:31:45 Fun fact: I once drank a cup full of oilive oil. On purpose. And I at a bag full of moth-infested pistachio nuts. Not on purpose. @ellielockx @emmydee73 @mjdeeswriter @FinlaysonPalmer @KatrinaAriel
3000 2018-03-23 17:31:37 But their continued complacency about climate change, signing the Paris Accord and then over-ruling ppl's refusal to have needless fracking and oil drilling when renewables are providing cheap non-polluting energy shows their basic immorality.
3001 2018-03-23 17:31:25 Diffuser/essential oil pals,

Any recs for energy boost? I tried orange, frankincense, and cinnamon re recipe from some website but idk lol
3002 2018-03-23 17:31:24 Yes, it’s illegal which I think is fine but for medicinal purposes, the oil should be made legal.
3003 2018-03-23 17:31:13 getting an oil change reminds me that i don’t miss working in an auto shop at all
3004 2018-03-23 17:31:11 Only I would fill a shelf full of boxes containing olives + olive oil for the shelf to break and fall off the wall and smash many jars full of olives + olive oil all over the FUCKING floor  happy days 
3005 2018-03-23 17:31:07 That doesn't make sense. You think OPEC+ wouldn't know they were producing oil, and at what volume?
3006 2018-03-23 17:30:59 It's got oil in it, right? OURS.
3007 2018-03-23 17:30:57 my hair was dry af moe!!  i need the oil with the spout so i can just run it throughout my entire head & keep it moving lol

3010 2018-03-23 17:30:45 I've been saying it for years, but drilling and pumping all the oil up is causing all the sinkholes because I know absolutely nothing and just saw the headline of this article once about Texas that I'm too lazy to post a link to, @ScienceAlert 
3011 2018-03-23 17:30:45 It looked like an oil painting at first, you've done such a wonderful job.

3022 2018-03-23 17:29:41 Man I got some noise like a damn leaf tappin against my fan or some shit.. Lol bout to have them check that out while they change this oil RT @DetNigga: I need to see where this squealing coming from

3025 2018-03-23 17:28:59 Q. When will emerging China carbon pricing regime be applied to refineries? A. Sooner than we think, is my guess, and when it happens, low carbon-intensity crude oil should have a competitive advantage.
3026 2018-03-23 17:28:49 What's the best oil for my scalp? Tea tree got me smellin like I'm fresh off the boat. Coconut oil been keeping my shit shiny but
3027 2018-03-23 17:28:49 Apparently people from Texas don’t say the world “oil” correctly.
3028 2018-03-23 17:28:46 It’s really not much of a switch! Their actions r identical! Drop bombs! Drill for oil! Expand the military! Silence politicians like Bernie Sanders, that push for single-payer healthcare, infrastructure spending and student debt relief, things that will actually help th citizens
3029 2018-03-23 17:28:39 Forget the fvcking nails, you see that vintage wrist watch? That back in the day was only won by niggas with oil money..
3030 2018-03-23 17:28:17 @JamesGRickards I hear zero about China gold backing their trade note for oil Monday, totally relevant to trade war, no? or am I missing something.
3031 2018-03-23 17:28:09 Looks more like McDonald’s material.  Nvm i heard the one kid was rejected by Hamburger U too.
3032 2018-03-23 17:28:04 As always, I’m treated to spectacular service as I wait for my car at @PassportNissanV. Oil change, state inspection AND a car wash for free. What a great way to end what has been an otherwise crappy week.
3033 2018-03-23 17:27:54 One thing they oppose is armed security.
 Tells you a lot. As proved its the one thing that can have Immediant effect. Obstinace is telling.
3034 2018-03-23 17:27:51 They need to hurry up with this oil change 
3035 2018-03-23 17:27:42 Arre yaar. Just muted this idiot who quote tweeted every tweet about the CA leak with 'Data is the new oil'.

3043 2018-03-23 17:26:53 INR has started to fall against USD from the start of the month..rise in crude oil prices coupled with weaker rupee is a bad news for us as India is a net importer...this widens the current account deficit...

3046 2018-03-23 17:26:39  ... Geopolitics? Mon 26th March 2018, China launches what some call the ‘petro-yuan’, a gold backed yuan oil contract - guess who’s likely to be an ‘early adopters’?  Iran  Venezuela  maybe Syria  - enter stage left the American Psychos!
3047 2018-03-23 17:26:37 it's pretty insane how well it has sold with absolutely no reason to own one. props to Don Mattrick with the successful launch and Philly Spence for selling snake oil.
3048 2018-03-23 17:26:35 It shouldn’t.  But with a 4.2L engine, and high mileage...

It would cost me over $50 to do it myself.  ( plus having to buy tools, ramps, & disposal of oil ).
3049 2018-03-23 17:26:30 SO DO WE ALL REALIZE THAT PUTTING ALL OUR OF EGGS IN THE OIL BASKET IS TERRIBLE. #ableg
3050 2018-03-23 17:26:25 you'll note the 70's had a high death count as well ... Nixon's "drug war" became noted expression in 71, oil crisis 73, energy crisis79 and, of course, US involvement in Vietnam 65-75 ... your point of drug "war" causing police deaths once again seems accurate
3051 2018-03-23 17:26:24 Very nice work 
See you in Glasgow Zev

3054 2018-03-23 17:26:14 Suddenly have Midnight Oil stuck in my head and no idea why.
3055 2018-03-23 17:26:02 incense is worse than scented oil because it produces smoke where oil evaporates with water
3056 2018-03-23 17:25:59 Deep condition NOW SIS.. lil hot oil treatment. Twist up yo hair for a few days. Treat your mane like a newborn baby sis.
3057 2018-03-23 17:25:42 @Chesapeake @DevonEnergy and all oil companies quit going against our @TeacherOklahoma and leave the state senators alone!! Pay more and agree to it!! #oilindustry for #education!! #oklaed #teacherstrike #BreakingNews
3058 2018-03-23 17:25:37 someone's been using my olive oil........ I can tell cause I always leave it in a very specific position and it was moved
3059 2018-03-23 17:25:33 This administration is running like a well-oiled oil spill.
3060 2018-03-23 17:25:32 The more oil goes up the more they start giving out bonuses for everything so I’m not gonna complain
3061 2018-03-23 17:25:15 Context is everything and without a good working knowledge of life in general, history, good decisions cannot be made. Facts vs emotion
3062 2018-03-23 17:25:15 Maybe because it will end up in landfill/the ocean and it's a really wasteful way to use up the oil that's left?
3063 2018-03-23 17:25:04 When I travel (I’m a flight attendant) I bring a small container of coconut oil to use as hand cream, body cream, chap stick, moisturizer, hair product... It turns into a solid when it’s less than 75 degrees so that allows me to bring an extra liquid.
3064 2018-03-23 17:25:01 Sources.. Articles and such claiming they have a method that is repeatable to create that sort of “safety” that Project Aristotle and others “describe”. Not seen actually one that isn’t at least 50% snake oil or making dangerous suggestions.
3065 2018-03-23 17:24:50 i didnt listen.. there were two.. the trump one has stuffed nix - I want to know who the oil companies they were working for (american i suspect ) which means the irsraeli hackers are the ones they have announced today I reckon (ex mossad) means  america oil/ israeli collusion

3076 2018-03-23 17:23:11 Hey @realDonaldTrump I just heard some breaking news that the @ACBofficials found oil on their camp, can you go take care of it so @Irelandcricket can play in the @ICC World Cup ? 
Thanks

3077 2018-03-23 17:22:56 That is not how guys like him are wired. While many players will partially go through the motion down the stretch in what is a lost season, the elite of the elite are not capable of that.
3078 2018-03-23 17:22:51 Just wait and see the CROOKS IN WASHINGTON are going to raise the GAS TAX they can't stand to see the American PEOPLE getting ahead they will blame low gas prices when the price of oil goes up you can bet your ASS THEY WON'T LOWER THE TAX
3079 2018-03-23 17:22:45 Baker Hughes oil rigs 804, +4 on the week
3080 2018-03-23 17:22:44 Definitely agree ensuring availability of the black oil sunflower seed. I also use a special woodpecker blend specific suet (8 of those) and a northeastern multi seed blend. The damn squirrels & chipmunks are a problem. I do have to use airsoft deterrent with them.
3081 2018-03-23 17:22:42 The Take-5 oil workers treat me better than my ex did lmao
3082 2018-03-23 17:22:36 The entire project is attached to an increase in oil tanker traffic out of Westridge from 5 to 37. It has more to do with oil tankers that it does to gas prices here knowing the refineries we need to process that oil are in the US, not here...not in Alberta. Those are the facts!
3083 2018-03-23 17:22:24 Wow,  do you think she uses a coconut oil leave in treatment? 'Cause her hair is geourgous
3084 2018-03-23 17:22:21 Did a man really just convince me I need to pay $70 for my oil change? yes
3085 2018-03-23 17:21:56 Stewart Morris, the man who once took Shirley Bassey up the dirty pipe of a North Sea oil rig owned by the Bush family.
3086 2018-03-23 17:21:35 Soaking ym skin in coconut oil, taking a shower and feeling good for 12 minutes before going back to depressed millenial things is selfcare
3087 2018-03-23 17:21:34 Gots to get my oil changed today
3088 2018-03-23 17:21:30 I suggest CBD oil.
3089 2018-03-23 17:21:27 Salmon Oil can be obtained reasonably at PuritanPride.

Much more concentrated than salmon.  It saved my life
3090 2018-03-23 17:21:24 I use Jiffy Lube. Mostly because it’s right around the corner.  But yeah, big engine ( extra oil, extra $ ) and a premium for high mileage  oil and it just breaks $100.
3091 2018-03-23 17:21:24 はーい
3092 2018-03-23 17:21:23 get some oil and massage the achey Aki
3093 2018-03-23 17:21:10 I can say for sure no mj, playing the harti card didn't work for gaas and pirateland what makes you think it will work for you, once oil is tapped in other parts of SL and money and development reaches sool what makes you think the ppl there will choose to come under pirateland.
3094 2018-03-23 17:21:09 The oil spill that BP ain't clean up

3097 2018-03-23 17:20:58 Put hot oil treatments in your hair. & try braiding it or Bantu knots or twist outs, to help the curl come back to its shape. Keep oiled , & always keep it braided up or somehow don’t ever just leave it out in a ponytail or something.
3098 2018-03-23 17:20:54 @MpMiles3 it takes weed or my cure does not work smf in florida we legalized marijuana but they don't allow it to be sold only cbd oil Vape crap PEOPLE LIKE TO SMOKE A JOINT & SM-OOZE EACH OTHER  keep waiting on Rod Sterling from twilight zone to pop out it is  form of terrorism
3099 2018-03-23 17:20:53 My bank account is getting slapped from insurance, food, beer, gas, now I took a $127 dollar hit for an oil change and detail and I’m changing the pipe and jetting my quad next week. I officially hate spending money it causes stress

3106 2018-03-23 17:20:35 Islam is the cause of alot of poverty. Oppressive theocratic regimes which tend to ferment in islamic contries aren't really known for there wealth creaction. Unless they are sitting on oil. Then it makes a lot of wealth for the leadership.
3107 2018-03-23 17:20:34 Ohhhhh i forgot i might have tiger balm somewhere in the house. Will have to go hunting. I also have a oil diffuser I will pop on in a bit. Pretty sure I have lavender oil somewhere :)

3109 2018-03-23 17:20:29 It's true. Us have 70 percent of oil having 10 percent of a country. Masterpiece...
3110 2018-03-23 17:20:26 how TF does it take 6+ hours to change the oil in a car I've got places to be I just really can't
3111 2018-03-23 17:20:14 "Oil company lawyer, speaking for all oil companies, admits man-made climate change is real." So the only two people left who deny it are Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak.
3112 2018-03-23 17:20:05 ทำไมถึง
3113 2018-03-23 17:19:58 But then you'll have to go back to trying to find a normal job in the russian economy and unless you're some kind of oil engineer, I guess trolling is your only go to
3114 2018-03-23 17:19:31 And just plain black oil sunflower seems to get me the broadest range of visitors (but if you can get a feeder with a seedcake cage on the sides the woodpeckers will visit too).  We get hairy woodpecker and red bellied woodpeckers on those, plus my favorite the nuthatches.
3115 2018-03-23 17:19:25 Funny, they used to blame all that on the oil companies. Isn't that the general consensus? Oil is all that the Middle East has to cause countries to invest the money there to influence things? We actually never invaded any of Israel's direct neighbors.
3116 2018-03-23 17:19:12 Hot oil treatments fee so good bruh
3117 2018-03-23 17:19:08 I’m so thankful that my dad got an automotive shop so i don’t have to pay for oil changes and shit 
3118 2018-03-23 17:18:56 Our rights grease the machine, even yours.  The squeaky wheels get the oil. Turn your eye and the guns will go back to their cabinet.
3119 2018-03-23 17:18:32 Changing my oil would be a pain if my filter was easily accessible
3120 2018-03-23 17:18:18 baby oil, but i use micellar water
3121 2018-03-23 17:18:08 That's what happens when you kill over 1 million people in Iraq for oil.
3122 2018-03-23 17:18:04 Read Mortal Engines on an actual Traction City.

Or failing that, an oil rig or something.
3123 2018-03-23 17:17:55 Exactly. Id like an inquiry into the oil and gas protesters. Its not climate concern but economic. It wouldn’t suprise me if Soros has funded the protest.
3124 2018-03-23 17:17:46 Call in the Special Forces or club him with a Baguette.
3125 2018-03-23 17:17:30 Compra oil e vende EWZ

3127 2018-03-23 17:17:18 I use Alpha Stim, clips to my ears and sends very low grade electric shock across brain resetting the nerves that cause the migraines. 30 mins and migraine is gone. I also use a lavender pillow liner and lavender oil when I sleep.
3128 2018-03-23 17:17:18 I guess it would if they still sold their oil thru russia and iraq then the rest of opec increased output by 1.5 mb/d to compensate.
3129 2018-03-23 17:17:11 Wait, Brian. Do you think it is a “lie” that oil prices have been and still are low? You live in Fort Mac!!

3140 2018-03-23 17:15:49 it's not so hard if someone took the time to talk to a Sanders supporter. I mean if we are just going to come up with conspiracy theories for the hell of it, then HRC is married to Trump and Bill is just a body suit that Trump fits in using 1 pound of olive oil( healthier)
3141 2018-03-23 17:15:44 Now, now, you can't discriminate. Take them all!  
3142 2018-03-23 17:15:37 True, Crude oil has be processed to be used (From Separation>Conversion>Treating). The same thing with data, it has to undergo separation>conversion>treatment so as to remove the errors, redundancy, inconsistency to ensure data quality not quantity.
3143 2018-03-23 17:15:29 Can we be swift with this oil change so I can move on to more pressing matters like...getting my nails done? 
3144 2018-03-23 17:15:26 Massage your gums with salt &mustard oil for 2 minutes.Rinse with warm water.This will increase the blood circulation& makes the gums stronger & healthier.
3145 2018-03-23 17:15:21 I mostly use jojoba oil (lighter than coconut): makeup remover, face moisturizer, in my hair (I have weird hair so I was shocked to discover it worked better than any product I owned. I used to spend a ton on hair stuff). I use coconut oil on my body / feet. Put it on my dog too
3146 2018-03-23 17:15:21 Got some olive oil in my eye and I’ve never know such pain in my life.

3147 2018-03-23 17:15:15 But trump, like obama is pro big oil and pro drilling! Th liquidize natural gas that the USA leads th world in, really has very little to do with their Government.

3153 2018-03-23 17:14:26 Not unless it is a cash grab by the oil Companies. Higher prices to incentivize reduced consumption is OK

3157 2018-03-23 17:14:00 By taxing solar panels being brought into the country and deregulating the coal and oil industries? 
Trumps environmental council pick said “CO2 is not a pollutant” and Trump hasn’t released the CO2 emissions report for 2017... how’s that “enabling reduction”?
3158 2018-03-23 17:13:23 Lmaooo. Better go and buy baby oil and ori and Vaseline for easier penetration
3159 2018-03-23 17:13:22 Oil Prices jumped a percent on comments from Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who said he expected the OPEC+ production cut deal would be extended into next year.
3160 2018-03-23 17:13:22 If it’s outrageous I’ll be out your sure it ain’t in Lucas Oil??
3161 2018-03-23 17:13:15 Just cut my hair, shaved and applied coconut oil to all and sundry. If andiwini tonight then I don’t know

3163 2018-03-23 17:13:11 Go north if you want to have opportunities, Right now there good paying jobs in North Dakota,and you will find the people very friendly. The western part of the state has a lot of jobs related to the oil industry
3164 2018-03-23 17:12:58 was it innocent? I did actually wonder after......
3165 2018-03-23 17:12:55 Hey @Target, you should start offering car washes and oil changes! I’d much rather walk around there than the “other place”.
3166 2018-03-23 17:12:51 เฮ้อ
3167 2018-03-23 17:12:50 Uh... On an oil rig? Great business plan, Callie.
3168 2018-03-23 17:12:37 I'll work as many jobs as needed if it means my future wife doesnt have to sell oil and supplements in a pyramid scheme.
3169 2018-03-23 17:12:35 I’ve looked into climategate so called extensively and you won’t find anything other than opinion articles still propagating the idea. You never explained why lawyers for big oil would concede in court if it’s all a scam?
3170 2018-03-23 17:12:25 AAAAA WHO TF CREATED THIS OIL MEME IM HAVING A GOOD TIME
3171 2018-03-23 17:12:21 And the lies continue! This country IS NOT one of your reality shows or a business for a snake oil salesmen like you! YOU ARE A JOKE! Stay tuned ppl, this guy is going down!!

3224 2018-03-23 17:05:39 Very wise. For me, trying to get my Dad to show me how to change the oil was like pulling teeth. My oldest brother had his own engine lift, but Dad was like, "That's his thing so I won't teach the rest of you."

3237 2018-03-23 17:03:59 Scaring Canadians into accepting what you think Canada needs isn't going to help your cause build this pipeline. You need to address oil tankers and oil spills or better yet come out to Vancouver take a walk along the seawall with the thousands others to what's really is at risk!

3321 2018-03-23 16:54:42 I saw that one, looked lovely! The Big Sleep jelly bomb, a bubble bar called “Pearl” something, forget the name, & flowers in the barrow oil!
3322 2018-03-23 16:54:33 GUSH and DRIP are oil ETFs. Guess the Bullish one?
3323 2018-03-23 16:54:26 I'm no oil painting & greatly lacking in the looks department, a sober man might well have thought twice before trying it on with me.
That said neither creep was left in any doubt what I thought of their wandering fingers.
3324 2018-03-23 16:54:14 These killers are a product of society/schools and direction it's been going. Instead of asking why, they push accelerator for more of it.
3325 2018-03-23 16:54:11 But @Roger0Anderson...you yourself admitted to me that you want the pipeline built for your own personal economic reasons, to pay your mortgage. You don't even live where these oil tankers will be sailing from yet you want us to accept this risk for you. #StopKM #bcpoli #cdnpoli
3326 2018-03-23 16:53:59 By going back to oil lamps, fireplaces and pen and paper. ;-)
3327 2018-03-23 16:53:58 So @thebubblebubble works a few buildings down the road from me. Why did you block me mr bubble? You should be one of those advisors sucking up to me? oil/gas is rebounding - pay raises going through
3328 2018-03-23 16:53:22 Brennan was CIA Director in charge of verifying false info 
Trump at the time is on record for neither believing the report or wanting war
He has also begun exporting oil + energy.. no more kids dying for oil
3329 2018-03-23 16:53:21 Why do you think uranium used as fuel in reactors, which is sold on a global market, is some kind of super important national security issue??

Do we not have coal and nat gas and oil to fuel our country if we couldn't use our nuclear reactors?
3330 2018-03-23 16:53:17 [Emu Oil Benefit] Improves digestive health: Fatty acids in emu oil can help enhance digestive health, while emu oil's anti-inflammatory capabilities can aid w/ addressing gastrointestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease. #emuoil #digestion RT
3331 2018-03-23 16:53:13 I spent $50 on Amazon last night subconsciously. I blame @FatKidDeals... on the bright side I have 2 oil diffusers coming on Saturday lol
3332 2018-03-23 16:53:11 Some basic truths:
our modern world requires LOTS of energy
much of that energy comes from burning coal oil
when you burn coal & oil it releases C02 
C02 traps heat (you can prove it in a 6th grade lab!)
C02 is not going to stop trapping heat bcse of the Heartlands media strategy
3333 2018-03-23 16:53:02 Agradezco a Medios Red su reportaje sobre la crisis de #Oil.
3334 2018-03-23 16:52:55 bruuu this reminds me of jack in the box when they threw oil on a bitch 
3335 2018-03-23 16:52:52 Europe can only defeat Putin by refusing his oil . Suffer and survive, or appease and be conquered.
3336 2018-03-23 16:52:48 The oil market hasn't even fully paid for its pre 2008 sins. There was a short trip down to $30 but then it just bounced up to $100 and onto another 6 year party. There hasn't been a true bear market since 2000.
3337 2018-03-23 16:52:40 As we've established, according to @NoRulers_, communism is a form of capitalism and crony capitalism/corporatism, such as Standard Oil, leads to lower prices, which justifies the system.
3338 2018-03-23 16:52:39 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -0.44% #DAX -1.77% #CAC -1.39% #Estoxx50 -1.34% #GBPUSD 1.4148 #EURGBP 0.8731 #GILTBUND 0.0 #Gold 1.63% #Oil 1.67%

3347 2018-03-23 16:51:51 Oil companies in Alaska are trying to push out unions from their  contracts so they can hire outsiders. Paying them less and continuing to squeeze every cent out if the Alaskan economy through oil production/exploration tax credits.

3349 2018-03-23 16:51:29 They are part of a group of GOP leaders going against the @POTUS agenda is. They got paid a stipend by Clinton to thwart @realDonaldTrump was going for. They both need to have their mouths washed out with lye soap, followed by a good dose of Cod Liver Oil. That"ll cure 'em.

3352 2018-03-24 23:59:29 A treatment is nothing without it leading to a cure. It’s a bit like the oil indicator light coming on in a car, but only removing the bulb instead of putting oil in. Money is being made hand over fist at the expense of people, and we are sacrificing our children in the process.
3353 2018-03-24 23:59:04 if you’re King Salman, what do you do?
Give up the reliance on oil
use existing wealth to stay wealthy.
To modernize trade 2 incl more than just exports of oil.
They would need to build an 
ENTIRE INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY.from Scratch. 
To do that, he needs USA......
3354 2018-03-24 23:58:57 same here it was almost like when i started taking proper care of my skin i had less oil and i’ve been loving and embracing the oil that does produce because i don’t think i could ever handle having dry skin omg
3355 2018-03-24 23:58:44 This haircut shit is for the birds. I'm bout to grow my hair back out I'd rather pay for some coconut oil and twist my hair then spend time in barbershops.
3356 2018-03-24 23:58:44 Mr McGee , Lucas oil stadium looks full.  It holds 70k.  It’s snowing like hell outside 
You get twice as many people cause the machine only has 2 wheels ?
3357 2018-03-24 23:58:31 imagine trying to save $30 and end up buying 5 extra quarts of oil and 7 quarts of transmission fluid instead
3358 2018-03-24 23:58:23 I think it will be averted but still think that China, as a surplus nation, is more vulnerable than the US. And, yes, China's economy more developed, BUT true autarky does require a little help from Mother Nature. No matter how industrious, China can't "create" oil or foodstuffs.

3394 2018-03-24 23:55:23 You are one stupid sob. America's been giving Israel three to five billion dollars per year for the last 50 years. And the Middle East Wars, are being fought for Israel and oil. I'm just trying to wake you up but you have to do your own homework.
3395 2018-03-24 23:55:04 I would think if you’re trading anything to do with oil and you don’t now what the Middle East is...you may want to rethink your strategy.
3396 2018-03-24 23:54:55 after an hour in the tub I am both super soft and super pruny. I'm like a grandma who rolled in baby oil.
3397 2018-03-24 23:54:50 Yup. I like OILD right now though. I think oil will get hammered soon. Just this guys opinion.
3398 2018-03-24 23:54:48 Why would amerian companies mere with outside companies, american oil companies dont want to be part of opec let alone no 1 gives a F*** of opec numbers anymore, monopoly for opec is dead.

3401 2018-03-24 23:54:11 somebody in a FB group asked how to stay matte all day and i told her that excess powder and touch ups may help but she’ll still get oily & tried to tell her this and some girl told me she’s oily af and knows how to stop her oil from coming thru & i was all ...ok.. sure ......

3403 2018-03-24 23:53:51 Muslim leaders have more influence over Western leaders than any Jews do. They have successfully used oil as a weapon for decades.
3404 2018-03-24 23:53:41 This guy on on FB said "Take CBD oil and all your symptoms dissapperd" 

and included cancer as a symptom.

3406 2018-03-24 23:52:37 Give me an oil bloc? So little time.
3407 2018-03-24 23:52:21 Cool. But ya know, keep the celebs out of our nature. And your president out of our country (and his headlines every day). And hey while we're at it, we'll butt out our fresh water, hardwood and oil. 
3408 2018-03-24 23:52:20 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

3410 2018-03-24 23:51:38 2 of 2. Form balls, tighten in your palm, poke hole with your finger and insert mozzarella and peas, tighten again to shape ball. Beat egg whites, roll balls in it then roll in Italian bread crumbs. Let sit in fridge 10 min or more, fry in corn oil. Serve with marinara sauce.
3411 2018-03-24 23:51:37 I think I would focus on why more than what. Just me.
Take all guns and your still stuck with very sick ppl loose on society.
3412 2018-03-24 23:51:34 @CurtisGrimes I'm a little irresponsible, I'm 15,000 miles past the oil change I needed
3413 2018-03-24 23:51:10 At least our cricket team has shown the world what Australia actually stands for. International media should look into Saddam AWB bribes, East Timor gas & oil theft, Aboriginal deaths in custody and Manus & Nauru atrocities.

3421 2018-03-24 23:49:14 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
3422 2018-03-24 23:48:31 I'm of the opinion that with KSA, they do have some leverage over the US with their oil and willingness to go along with the petrodollar regime. Not that the US couldn't pressure them, but the US follows the path of least resistance.
3423 2018-03-24 23:47:48 You can really get them burning good and hot when you pump used oil on them, good thing the lights will be all shut off because darkness is a tire fires best friend!
3424 2018-03-24 23:47:26 Could it be because — I don’t know - just spitballing, it is? Who lead us into a 8 year war? Republicans. Who repealed the assault weapons ban? Republicans? Who wants to drill for oil in our natural resources. Here’s a shovel, keep digging and you might find - republicans.

3427 2018-03-24 23:46:50 I'm afraid it was you who was fooled, by the smiling snake oil salesmen promising the earth if we leave. This much has become obvious over the ensuing months. The broken promises, the myths about having no influence, the lie about not being sovereign, the fallacy of extra money.
3428 2018-03-24 23:46:40 It’s an oil slick... don’t use it if you have oily skin. Also, a bunch of flashback.
3429 2018-03-24 23:46:31 @HelloFresh @realhomechef Never should there be a recipe saying to add olive oil to a high heat pan. There are other oils than olive with its low smoke point and there are other spices than salt and pepper!  Canola would be better for the high heat.

Put my white dough in you 
And sauce you up with that prego

Thank you have a nice day.
3441 2018-03-24 23:43:42 Guten tag, it's Olive Oil. I've been contemplating if after all these jiffies you'd like to cha cha, bitch.
3442 2018-03-24 23:43:40 Thank you! I’m a fan of tgin products (shampoo and conditioners) they have lots of slip! (And black owned) ..Leave in conditioner, black castor oil and egostyler gel or ms. Jessie’s curly custard to style depending on my mood lol. Denman brush is also a major key

3446 2018-03-24 23:42:54 Soros will keep using him and paying him to spew his gun-hate.
3447 2018-03-24 23:42:45 Nah, I'm vegetarian. Right now one of my favorite budget meals is burgers. I make 8 patties at a time with TVP, bread crumbs, eggs, and some spices and stuff. Fried in oil, super tasty and high in protein too. 8 meals right there
3448 2018-03-24 23:42:36 These are adults. Thought this was for kids.
3449 2018-03-24 23:42:09 Why are you going back to the paper system?
3450 2018-03-24 23:42:07 I'm not down for hot oil wrestling, but I'd get in the ring with Shane! #thelword
3451 2018-03-24 23:42:05 all of these tips are so amazing thank you!!! i haven’t wanted to try oil pulling for a while now, how long do you usually do it for? & yes green tea and stretching in the morning are my go to
3452 2018-03-24 23:41:48 Che inglese d'oil che abbiamo qui
3453 2018-03-24 23:41:35 I have no particular preferences, as long as the Olive oil doesn't come from sandniggers it's ok for me.
3454 2018-03-24 23:41:21 Canad will not refine its own oil...not because of our leadership because harper would have been all over that. I think it is systemic sort of why there is no avro anymore...
3455 2018-03-24 23:40:43 When I think of ND, I think of #NoDAPL & violence used against Indigenous water protectors at the hands of big oil & paid-for govt. Politicians take $ fr special interest & citizens are sold out. Fight fracking, pipelines & big money. Support @PeyerForSenate. Vote out Heitkamp
3456 2018-03-24 23:40:41 Diana,add oil
don't play the mobile phone when u are running
 be careful
3457 2018-03-24 23:40:30 Yeah it helps. I also have an oil diffuser and use at night. Helps big time. Actually able to get good sleep when I used it.
3458 2018-03-24 23:40:16 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。

3461 2018-03-24 23:40:04 Like all these natural solutions E.P.oil needs to be taken with caution, but I expect you'd ask your Dr about it. After trial & error I settled on one 500mg cap per day. So many brands available - I chose one for vegetarians from Boots. 6 - 8 weeks is a good trial period.

3467 2018-03-24 23:38:31 We lives in Formby, but not been down beach for a few weeks cos of palm oil. It not be gud for furs. Me an da old timer went today. It was lufferly and sunny. Had maffis zoomies! 
3468 2018-03-24 23:38:29 Clove oil? Gin?
3469 2018-03-24 23:38:26 Gov: Let's blow up those guys - they won't use the Dollar to trade oil.
Commercial News: Democracy comes in Colors now, CIA says it's fun to join a street march.
National TV: Is breaking a window violence? How much pepper spray should police use when a glazier gets more work?
3470 2018-03-24 23:38:09 Coconut oil works great for removal too, and doesn't dry your hands if you are a doof that gets stuff on you on a weekly basis like me
3471 2018-03-24 23:38:05 Keep them coming (as I remove the pits from my oil cured olives for pasta)
3472 2018-03-24 23:37:55 I get that; what I was saying is that politicians make broad statements of victory or defeat without too much evidence to support their statements. 

I know Farage claimed 52% wasn't a mandate and then a few hours later claimed it was. The guy is slippier than an oil wrestler.
3473 2018-03-24 23:37:51 What do you call the folks who believe the snake oil salesman? C'mon people, he's a marketing guy who plays the part very well...that news conference was absurd..."I won't do it again"...of course, he was signing it.
3474 2018-03-24 23:37:47 Olive oil works wonders on dried out hair in case you were wondering 
3475 2018-03-24 23:37:33 He stepped into the ring and is throwing punches. He's fair game.
3476 2018-03-24 23:37:23 Oliv oil  untung bukan baby oil
3477 2018-03-24 23:37:21 I read this as “lil oil” was very confused
3478 2018-03-24 23:37:19 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you?re craving shiny legs that aren?t greasy.
3479 2018-03-24 23:37:06 Google Doctors are at it again. Reading and understanding are two different things for crying out loud. “Put coconut oil on the balls?” 
3480 2018-03-24 23:36:53 Really, no reason. No reason to support human rights. No reason to oppose Russian influence in a geography that holds a vast resource the GOP holds so dearly~ which is oil. Man you are truly shedding insight.
3481 2018-03-24 23:36:48 Of course Volkswagen is bougie with their windshield wiper requirements just like the oil changes. Highest quality only
3482 2018-03-24 23:36:44 "There's nothing for me to hurt over. I'm /fine/, Glynda. The worry is appreciated, but absolutely unnecessary."

Cinder's tone was growing harsher. Now, not only did archers shoot their flaming arrows down upon the battering rams of Glynda's concern, but burning oil also >>>
3483 2018-03-24 23:36:30 Converting tablespoons 2 mL; mixin hair masque. U can look at figures on a chart or ask the Q online. Coconut oil is my base. Already know what dinner's gonna b; gonna bake flounder filet n olive oil, have a salad & fresh fruit.
3484 2018-03-24 23:36:29 @drewmagary raw cucumbers with oil, vinegar, and mayo.  Mayo made up the vast majority of that concoction.  It was awful but old people loved it.
3485 2018-03-24 23:36:18 You think your Pedophile Luciferian Masters are worried about gun violence?? GUNS, OIL AND DRUGS HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY. INJUSTICE HERE TO STAY.
3486 2018-03-24 23:36:17 More than a little hollow coming from an atheist. Everything this kid does is for show, fame, potential fortune.
3487 2018-03-24 23:36:07 Wow who would poor hot oil on there daughter
3488 2018-03-24 23:35:53 They make wipes you can carry around made specifically for dabbing up excess oil during the day. They’re like blue i think lol You could find them on amazon
3489 2018-03-24 23:35:48 Apparently the truth is no defence - lots of dirty foreign money backstopping this anti oil jihad .
3490 2018-03-24 23:35:34 I just made potent onion oil. It will now sit & continue infusing.
3491 2018-03-24 23:35:32 Friends, I'm thinking of penning something on the #CBD oil phenomenon (health benefits, best brands and lifestyle stuff). Any and all leads welcome! #journorequest #prrequest #blogger #cbdoil #wellness #indiebusiness
3492 2018-03-24 23:35:22 Coconut oil literally is like Jesus in a jar.... it works miracles on literally everything

3502 2018-03-24 23:33:18 That is an argument that says we should produce everything here.  What if it’s cheaper to produce more food offshore?  And your happy to see oil and gas banned?  #notlongtermsecurity
3503 2018-03-24 23:33:12 I am still not completely sure what the appeal is with olives. Olive oil? Yes I totally see the appeal in that. But the actual olives? At best...meh
3504 2018-03-24 23:32:48 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3505 2018-03-24 23:32:41 Chuck Norris likes &amp;quot;Sunny D&amp;quot; because it contains his favorite things. Oranges and motor oil.
3506 2018-03-24 23:32:12 Energy sector is the anomaly. Oil higher, energy sector sideways, market crashing. If oil hadn't rallied last week, the stock market would have been mych uglier.
3507 2018-03-24 23:32:10 1/10th of a stick of butter and coconut oil in your coffee. Thats really weird.
3508 2018-03-24 23:32:05 Spaceship computer voice: here, again, is your periodic reminder that the thing you just pulled out of boiling oil is still hot

3516 2018-03-24 23:30:41 @BuckIAlum @CassieRobinette 

I met the guy today that you ladies bought my beard oil from for Christmas.  He seemed like a good dude.  He told me to thank you for him again since I'm a repeat costumer now.
3517 2018-03-24 23:30:40 Suggestion: Missions (To get extra cash) like going through stormy weather / Pirate infested waters in the Alabama / Or containing an oil spill /  docking a massive ship at a small dock / Anything like that would be awesome
3518 2018-03-24 23:30:23 Diet reminders: eat oily fish twice a week and take a fish oil supplement on every other day.

3520 2018-03-24 23:30:10 Your buddy over here was trying to be a big burly mechanic boy and change his own oil. In my haste, unscrewed the wrong drain plug and got the pleasure of changing my transmission fluid in addition to doing my oil twice. 0/10 would not recommend.
3521 2018-03-24 23:30:03 Confusion is better than stupid conclusions. Volunteering means to create a conducive atmosphere to touch the Divine, light an oil lamp.
3522 2018-03-24 23:30:01 Fun fact: Coconut oil is an easy at-home treatment for head lice.

Gonna have to get an oil change soon though 
3532 2018-03-24 23:27:44 I would have thought the oil companies. The NRA takes 0 tax dollars,Planned Parenthood gets 500 Million of your tax dollars to buy Democratic votes
3533 2018-03-24 23:27:38 Só queria dizer que o oil concentrado tá não tá batendo, tá espancando
3534 2018-03-24 23:27:27 They also said we play in "Lucas Oil Field" not a great crew on call.

3538 2018-03-24 23:26:43 LMAO yall made her delete the steaming, calamine lotion vagina and coconut oil balls thread
3539 2018-03-24 23:26:36 The type of ‘change’ you promised the American people. It was change, alright, it should have had ‘disastrous’ in front.  Your mode of leadership was and will go down in the history books as ‘novice-like’. You made yourself rich, like the snake-Oil-Salesmen’ of olden days!
3540 2018-03-24 23:26:30 Existe la free oil, terminaras amándola también.
3541 2018-03-24 23:26:21 Unless there is inflationary 'collapse' I would suggest US$20 a barrel is about where its going.   Gold to Oil ratio breaking down.  Gold going to be a lot more expensive relative to Oil in the future.
3542 2018-03-24 23:25:52 try lavender and coconut oil before u go to sleep
3543 2018-03-24 23:25:48 Oil as a main reason or excuse for bombing & invasions of Middle East nations. How convenient. 'They' want us to buy into that alibi for war. Oil is not a 'fossil fuel' and it's not a finite resource either. Oil is constantly being produced. It comes from minerals in the ground.
3544 2018-03-24 23:25:28 It’s men out here to treat you like a queen and you out here getting cheated on with hoes that come home smelling like peanut oil 
3545 2018-03-24 23:25:24 We need oil production to build meaningful futuristic consumer products like EVs.I’d prefer a pipeline go to a port surrounded with eyes with bodies on hand for a quick cleanup response.The fight here is Global prolific “waste” of oil for ICE transport, & plastic bags & bottles.

3549 2018-03-24 23:24:19 love using body oil my skin is so soft and smells sooooo good.
3550 2018-03-24 23:24:04 Imagine a world where Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussain were still alive... Where the U.S hadn't insisted on 'democracy' in another country. Where MILLIONS of lives hadn't been lost over money and oil.

The "Tyrants". 
The "Dictators"
The "Enemy"

Imagine.. 
3551 2018-03-24 23:23:54 It’s still the same game. I don’t see what are you trying to say? Nintendo was very upfront of what this game. Unlike Microsoft who does snake oil marketing for every game.
3552 2018-03-24 23:23:54 Beat my record: 
20,000 miles without an oil change
3553 2018-03-24 23:23:31 if olive oil is made from olives then what are baby oil made of?
3554 2018-03-24 23:23:18 36 cars entered tonight for the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series event at East Alabama Motor Speedway in Phenix City, AL
3555 2018-03-24 23:23:15 I have pretty much stopped having the “bars” that claim low carb based on the “fibers” they put in. Way too many spike me. It has been a while since I tried, not worth the spike. I just stick with ingredients I know. Stevia, cacao, coconut oil.... etc
3556 2018-03-24 23:22:52 Even if we refined oil, what are you going to do to the refined product? Email it to market?

If you knew anything beyond hearsay about this all, you’d know the problem is privatization/royalties. Which the NDP brought up but didn’t address to avoid negative impacts on our energy
3557 2018-03-24 23:22:02 same i also think its probably oil.... too bad we'll never be able to find out
3558 2018-03-24 23:21:44 Just fell in love with lemongrass essential oil. It is invigorating
3559 2018-03-24 23:21:43 You know it’s aces in the kitchen when you put the oil in the hot pan ... and then say “well at least it didn’t burst into flame this time” #distractedcooking #timing
3560 2018-03-24 23:21:41 You're very welcome. I've taken e.p.oil for many years, & the only times the depression returned occurred when I stopped taking it for a few days to see if I still needed it. Yes, Monk's Pepper - I've not tried it but I've heard it works for some women (& men for other reasons..)
3561 2018-03-24 23:21:38 The spate of "american military searching for oil" memes cropping up in recent weeks never ceases to amuse me, because it's on the nose each and every time.
3562 2018-03-24 23:21:37 Lmao specials on tire and oil changes
3563 2018-03-24 23:21:35 I,too,will be celebrating the progress of MANkind due to oil & gas by lighting up the house & yard for all to see. #CdnPoli
3564 2018-03-24 23:21:30 Me too. Oil look real bad here. Of course they look bad often these days.
3565 2018-03-24 23:21:19 You can also just sear on the stovetop in oil.
3566 2018-03-24 23:21:10 @UniforTheUnion Why the hell is this Unifor guy getting arrested as an anti-pipeline activist? 11,800 Unifor members work (Sorry probably a less now) in Alberta mostly in Oil Sands. DO SOMETHING or GET GET OUT OF ALBERTA.
3567 2018-03-24 23:20:52 I’m never coming to get an oil change on my own again...... I literally just said yes to everything they said I needed and now I’m spending more than what my Groupon coupon is covering :’(
3568 2018-03-24 23:20:45 Yeah right  that's y all I see is oil cars being pulled down the tracks!!!
3569 2018-03-24 23:20:42 @JBelmo How do you keep your left hand dry from all the oil when bowling without a rausin bag or a type  of powder?
3570 2018-03-24 23:20:33 You would have needed up telling the story of how you personally burnt down your own house while trying to bleach palm oil for "ofada stew" to your children...ThanQ Lord
3571 2018-03-24 23:20:20 Just shut up.

The NDP didn’t do a damn thing to hurt the energy sector... let’s not spread the BS of people bitter the old boys club in AB Oil doesn’t control our legislation anymore.

He has the turning circle of an oil tanker
3574 2018-03-24 23:19:56 In a recent personal experiment, our family purchased a jar of @Costco brand Hazelnut spread and a jar of @NutellaUSA and wow what a difference the use of palm oil makes. Costco brand is far superior because #PalmOilKills dries out of the @NutellaGlobal way too fast.
3575 2018-03-24 23:19:52 Trade is still bad. That won't change IF this is true. They gave Kassian a second (or third chance); this is a dumb look on Oil if they did. Also remember how all teams said they didn't know he was available and would have given more? Conflicting info here.
3576 2018-03-24 23:19:52 Nah, it was the ‘70s. Just a little baby oil.
3577 2018-03-24 23:19:46 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
3578 2018-03-24 23:19:38 Congrats to you. The Era is the shiznit. I'm using the pure oil pods.  I mainly vape flower, don't like the butane/chemical taste of most pens etc. But I'm in heaven with this baby! I'm surprised to say, I'm liking it better than flower! Home run with this one y'all.

3583 2018-03-24 23:18:58 Even Moro allowed attacks on Rome. 

Jews only tho (synagogue and El Al) but PLO then could guarantee oil. 

ISIS can't.
3584 2018-03-24 23:18:50 Their objective is not a military victory rather a prolonged war whereby  the government lends money which is payed back with interest by taxpayers, enriching the wealthy. Exploiting the resources such as oil a bonus. #auspol
3585 2018-03-24 23:18:48 Oya nah...  And don't forget to carry your anointing oil.  Goat 
3586 2018-03-24 23:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
3587 2018-03-24 23:18:35 Deuteronomy 8:8

3588 2018-03-24 23:18:17 Exactly. Thus, Powell will blink (as instructed) when necessary and our "median dot plots" have the farthest to fall. QE 4 is only a matter of time with debt issuance coming. Very costly, and Trump's war hire in Bolton will keep a floor under oil (roof on dollar). IMO
3589 2018-03-24 23:18:16 I thought they didn't burn gas in BC. I am very confused regarding the protests over KM. I thought BC didn't want our oil.
3590 2018-03-24 23:18:03 Mr. Tire commercial: “Free tire rotation with the purchase of an oil change” 

Nick: “but don’t your tires rotate every time you drive?!” 

Definitely found someone who makes me laugh, that’s for sure. 
3591 2018-03-24 23:17:53 Lol  very soon we will see short contracts below zero hehehe. The velocity of waterfall on oil will be painful.
3592 2018-03-24 23:17:50 Just because my Daddy drove a 70 hemi Charger in 75, doesn’t mean I have to. Change resistors are “hilarious”. Over 10yrs, Chevron diesel savings will pay 60% of my Tesla as I produce 0 emissions over a decade.But “yes”, we do need oil to make products like EVs. Stop wasting oil.
3593 2018-03-24 23:17:29 Shave with oil/ moisturiser? A good quality one that is. It works on my legs....xx
3594 2018-03-24 23:17:21 Yes. That and neck oil are my consistent go to beers
3595 2018-03-24 23:17:12 Season with Montreal seasoning. Heat a drop of oil & butter in pan over med-hi heat in pan. For med-rare, 5min on each side. As steak rests, the sauté mushrooms then add red wine, s & p. Cook down.

3597 2018-03-24 23:16:08 Ari has always been a cherry picker. He cheery picked “aluminum tubes” and “yellow cake” and “WMDs” to kill 4000+ American soldiers so his boss’ oil interests could get richer.

3599 2018-03-24 23:15:21 In addition, the US could have ended the Japanese war on China back in the '30s by banning oil exports to Japan, but they didn't have the guts...

3602 2018-03-24 23:14:46 @ElizabethMay why do you prefer foreign oil over Canadian oil? #cdnpoli
3603 2018-03-24 23:14:40 The #MarchForOurLives naysayers shouldn’t be posting as they cook fries at Burger King or change oil at Grease Monkey. The voice of the nearly unemployable is just noise.

3607 2018-03-24 23:13:12 Pity as a country you don’t live by that then, stop invading countries & trying to empire build for oil. You’re much happier causing wars & killing your own children with your lack of gun control, so get your own country in order first before you try the guilt trip sympathy pics.
3608 2018-03-24 23:13:05 To the good American people
Biafra/Nigeria
Biafra owns our huge oil wealth but is being used to sponsor terrorists Boko Haram by Mohammed Buhari, where as the Biafran people that owns it are suffering. Please call President Trump now and ask him to endorse Biafra Independence
3609 2018-03-24 23:12:58 the problem with chinas theory is that the price for the consumer of oil will be higher with their petroyuan than with petroUSD$

3612 2018-03-24 23:12:44 The oil saved our asses lol, but yeah, it’s a very fortunate place to be born
3613 2018-03-24 23:12:38 Watching #Occupied on Netflix.. you want to dismiss it as crazy hypothetical fiction, but yet when Oil and Russia are involved, is anything too crazy?
3614 2018-03-24 23:12:38 @realDonaldTrump  we the people could help you get people confirmed by pushing our representatives but if you pick people who are going to push for war, end the EPA and the FDA, sell off public land, be in the pockets of big oil, we will not help you. I voted for you once.

3619 2018-03-24 23:12:11 Btw Orange Oil is flammable.
3620 2018-03-24 23:11:57 Yet another snake oil salesmen.
3621 2018-03-24 23:11:31 I do not accept your claim that by supporting the LibDems I am somehow implicit in the deaths of people because of austerity. That is as stupid as saying you killed people in he Iraq war. You are behaving like a snake oil seller.
3622 2018-03-24 23:11:22 That vending machine would be filled with Nordic Naturals Fish Oil and organic New Zealand honey only
3623 2018-03-24 23:11:21 Been doing some additional DD into $TRCH and I really like what i see. This is not the company it was 3-4 years ago. Has all the makings of ONE that could be super special. Every so often one lines up like this Chart, news, and market it’s in (OIL)
3624 2018-03-24 23:11:11 Except that oil and gas have to be refined for public use, so paying for that process is a notable argument.

Water...I can boil or filter that myself.
3625 2018-03-24 23:11:01 I’ve heard that hot oil scalp massages once a week works awesome. Also, avoiding breakage helps bc if your hair’s always breaking off, it can’t get longer, lmao. Good luck

3628 2018-03-24 23:10:42 If the US existed in 1066, they would probably have killed Guillaume le Bâtard in order to get the oil that anointed him as a king (and I'm almost sure that they could do the same if Harold Godwinson had killed Guillaume at Hastings)

3634 2018-03-24 23:09:47 Move on from damn oil already. Gas is over...
3635 2018-03-24 23:09:29 My first time baking a cake with my bestie we flipped measurements for the oil and water and ended up with dough, her mom ended up kicking us out of the kitchen lol
3636 2018-03-24 23:09:22 olive oil, bread, various meats and cheeses
3637 2018-03-24 23:09:15 Agree bro. When I used to captain my warehouse side I used to cheat by putting coconut oil on the ball to make it swing more. Sandpaper to rough up the seam is next level. Sutherland’s response will be telling. I’ll bet it’s weak.

3645 2018-03-24 23:07:28 Oil in car has been changed! Had to go on a adventure for the filter but tis done!
3646 2018-03-24 23:07:20 The only WMD Saddam Hussein had was his intent to trade oil in Euros. The reason Qaddafi was snuffed out: he wanted to introduce a gold-backed currency to replace the petro-dollar. The Rothschild central banks depend on the petro-dollar to prop their ponzi scheme. Not good news!
3647 2018-03-24 23:07:16 Well, when I was nine I had at least two rifles...
3648 2018-03-24 23:06:53 The blatant myopic selfishness and greed portrayed by oil companies is sickening. Instead of fighting the inevitable, why didn’t they use their vast capital to transition to renewables? Bonuses and short term profits look to be driving humanity towards decades of strife.
3649 2018-03-24 23:06:44 He's a fucking idiot snake oil salesman.
3650 2018-03-24 23:06:05 All we ever get is people bitching about wanting chickens or having a shitty garden in their driveway. Or crazy racist ladies bitching about the smell of fish oil. #boring #needsmoreclever

3654 2018-03-24 23:05:48 Airport carriers & contractors opposing the @PANYNJ $19/hr min wage mandate you got to be kidding us! Trump cut your taxes, you pay less for oil & have profit from decades of outsourcing services to contractors that pay poverty wages. Passengers & workers deserve better. ENOUGH!

3657 2018-03-24 23:05:22 Oh that! I used to do it, but it hurt  my hair and scalp. I’ve been using coconut oil and that helped a lot, but my hair is so curly that i can’t put a comb through it dry.
3658 2018-03-24 23:05:15 This was the first mention in my timeline about this. Should have put BREAKING in there bruv. 

I used to just use coconut oil to make the kooka swing more when I was skipper. Sandpaper to rough up the seam is next level shit. Bye bye Smitty.
3659 2018-03-24 23:05:13 I support him and I know many more who do too. You know what they say-the squeaky wheel gets the oil. The media is the most racist baiters of hate and prejudice we have ever experienced. There are some of us who have never drank the koolaid.

3661 2018-03-24 23:04:58 @RachelNotley On March 24, 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, releasing 11 million gallons of crude oil. The immediate impacts were the deaths of 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbour seals, 247 bald eagles and 22 orcas.

3663 2018-03-24 23:04:57 Well, lies work well for Trump! To be a successful snake oil guy one needs people who will buy his shit! Apparently America has a plethora of that kind of person! Ask Rush and Ingraham and @FoxNews and especially Murdoch!
3664 2018-03-24 23:04:54 And then came Saudi oil money.. and all d good things in mideast were burned to ashes.. How lovely
3665 2018-03-24 23:04:49 We'll still need oil, just less of it. And oil sands won't be able to compete at reduced price point based on reduced demand. It's explained right near the end of the video

3674 2018-03-24 23:03:33 We wish we had 100 B in debt here in Ontario.If Alberta is not careful that will quickly double. Federal Liberals would really prefer to keep your oil in the ground & devalue your provincial resources value.
3675 2018-03-24 23:03:19 Hey Marc, will they be running on Saudi oil delivered by tankers to Quebec, or Alberta oil?
3676 2018-03-24 23:03:13 I love lathering coconut oil all over my body. Skin so silky soft.
3677 2018-03-24 23:03:09 She'd put slices on fresh bread, add good olive oil, sea salt and fresh ground pepper and say: «Jacques, you'll never eat better». She was right. The best food in the world is straight from the garden with very little done to it. Authentic.
3678 2018-03-24 23:03:04 turmeric is the new coconut oil lol
3679 2018-03-24 23:02:48 @ErrolDenton how’s the snake oil business going? I hear talk you couldn’t handle the pressure of being caught out as a fraud.

3687 2018-03-24 23:01:51 Will that encourage reinvestment in the 'hard to get' oil, detrimental to the environment? Then arises the affordability of folks to pay. Will thermodynamics have the final say?
3688 2018-03-24 23:01:47 Well Romania does have oil !

3713 2018-03-24 22:58:02 @Grimezsz Remote railways, tankers have no disaster control, trucking-huge carbon footprint, these methods will dramatically increase oil/fuel bills.

3716 2018-03-24 22:57:36 Had to miss a perfectly good protest rally today to watch a Duck Dynasty-looking guy replace the circulator on my oil burner. On the plus side, he didn't make fun of me for calling a gasket a "casket."

3718 2018-03-24 22:57:20 What are the best ways to make prints of large oil paintings?

3720 2018-03-24 22:57:11 An oil spill is almost as greasy as Jc's hair (I love you guys so much but you asked for it lol)
3721 2018-03-24 22:57:07 O God my Father, let Your special oil of favour rest upon me and my family now in Jesus' Name!!!

Look on the bright side..
You still have DeLPo motor oil
3723 2018-03-24 22:56:57 I would never pay extra to have someone pump gas for me. I pumped gas many summers,  and cleaned the windshield & checked the oil too. The locals often pumped their own, but we didn't give them a price break!
3724 2018-03-24 22:56:50 Neil?

Jessie once told me "The Don" used to rub banana peels on his new bats instead of linseed oil. Or other fruits if bananas weren't in season. 

And then get his pet goat to urinate on them. 

But you'd hardly call that cheating.

3725 2018-03-24 22:56:41 Invest in cardboard boxes and building private miltaries on oil platforms in the Indian Ocean.
3726 2018-03-24 22:56:40 Stop using all oil based products.
3727 2018-03-24 22:56:38 May be they are about to take his oil bloc so he is not happy
3728 2018-03-24 22:56:19 We need oil
3729 2018-03-24 22:56:00 Cause it’s getting a touch boring. Bayern and Juventus own their leagues, more through being meticulously, but City and PSG could dominate their leagues for years through oil money.
3730 2018-03-24 22:55:53 Yeah, you could use olive oil to moisturize but why would you WANT TO when there’s....... avocado oil and vegetable glycerin
3731 2018-03-24 22:55:41 I just ordered my rice water cleanser and cleansing oil. Got my vitamin c serum. All I need is some sheet masks and essence spray.
3732 2018-03-24 22:55:30 Dorothy: Did you say something?

Tin Woodsman: [indiscernible sounds from the Tin Man, who is rusted]

Dorothy: He said oil can!

Scarecrow: Oil can what?

Dorothy: Oil can.
3733 2018-03-24 22:55:29 It’s disgraceful especially since dems didn’t want black people like MLK to own guns!
3734 2018-03-24 22:55:22 This old idiot is calling people to arms meanwhile he has oil bloc in the Niger Delta. Who go suffer?
3735 2018-03-24 22:55:09 Ohhh love body oil 
3736 2018-03-24 22:55:07 No system is perfect but until someone comes up with a better way to do science and more specifically a better way to check results we are stuck with the peer review process. It’s certainly more reliable than listening to some quack selling snake oil.
3737 2018-03-24 22:54:38 Something cheerful with short chapters and a book you don’t mind getting sand and suntan oil on.
3738 2018-03-24 22:54:20 Do you do the thing where you lay on your side & hope that after a bit one side of the sinuses opens up? That feels so friggin good when it happens. A nice bath with eucalyptus or peppermint oil may help. Is Rob in pain? Hope you all feel better very soon!

3744 2018-03-24 22:53:51 The picture IS ABOUT THE NRA! We know big pharma spends, the oil and gas lobbies spend. You're grasping at straws right now. Just admit that $30 Million is unprecedented in relation to who the picture was about which is the NRA! Bottom line.

3750 2018-03-24 22:53:00 so i’m getting an oil change and this happens... 

mechanic: miss, we include a free vacuuming of the vehicle once we are done with the service. is it ok if we vacuum bc there is a long of good weed crumbs on the floor. 

me: go right ahead sir. 

 respect dude! 
3751 2018-03-24 22:52:56 The purpose of the new Kinder Morgan pipeline is to get more oil to tidewater (so they can sell it to Asian markets) It will greatly increase oil tanker traffic in the Strait of Georgia (& drive up prices that American refineries pay)
3752 2018-03-24 22:52:54 As of now, we need oil. We can’t cold turkey it, we can’t bottleneck it. We are being weaned off of it slowly. When we don’t need it, turn the taps off.

But as of now, what other method do you propose we transport oil with? Cause we DO need it. Trucks? Trains? Planes? Donkeys?
3753 2018-03-24 22:52:53 @Grimezsz Do you understand that pipelines are the most efficient, effective, cost-wise, and  safest way to transport oil/fuel? Pipelines have systems to detect leaks and can be shut off if there’s an incident.

3757 2018-03-24 22:52:34 If Biafra seize back our oil from Mohammed Buhari the founder of Boko Haram terrorist group their funding will collapse and they will surrender. Without cutting off their funding they will continue to massacre and kidnapp. President Trump Biafra Independence will end Boko Haram
3758 2018-03-24 22:52:06 He sits on the ground and grabs the decontaminator oil for his gash. He was a bit used to his company by now.

"If... You want..."

He sighs softly and starts to apply the oil, wincing a bit.

3773 2018-03-24 22:49:49 It’s just such a stupid thing to worry about. They aren’t pouring oil into the Potomac. 
3774 2018-03-24 22:49:32 Didn't I say we'd see oil get destroyed. As the evidence points to, it is inevitable. Only patience is required.
3775 2018-03-24 22:49:21 Coconut oil. Its the best!

3780 2018-03-24 22:48:45 Run the wrong fuel/oil mixture to many times and that needle needs taken out and cleaned
3781 2018-03-24 22:48:44 Took a walk/jog this morning, showered, got an oil change for hubs car, visited Winco for the first time (definitely won’t be my last!), shopped for groceries, went to the library, did the dishes, and now working on dinner. Depression sucks, but I live for the good days.

3793 2018-03-24 22:46:40 I love the feeling of my hair after a conditioning treatment with some avocado oil

3795 2018-03-24 22:46:24 Dem say make we apply coconut oil to our balls so e go smeh fine. Small time you go wake up for morning rat don chop one ball leave one
3796 2018-03-24 22:46:15 it is not a crime to own oil(s) but it is a crime that fairness, equity and justice is not practised as preached.
3797 2018-03-24 22:46:10 The only 2 things verified from all news i read (not Fox) it that it was verified the Kremlin during their cyber attack on Us targets a certain voter and second that Carter page while in Russia spoke with some big oil guy. Nothing else I can find.
3798 2018-03-24 22:45:56 How the hell is he completely overpowered like this?! The scarred face dark messiah could feel his back giving out at this rate..! Upon tapping Theodore shoulder in all of this oil madness, he was admitting his defeat!

Apart from little things like heating mats, I run an oil filled radiator in the winter and an 8000 air conditioner unit in the summer in each cabin. They are the main expenses. The cabins are in the garden. Would it be possible? And what would the outlay be?
3805 2018-03-24 22:44:41 Anybody questioning the importance of USA energy independence need only ask the EU how they feel about being at the mercy of Russian oil and gas.

Now TY is bold and has said the truth
3809 2018-03-24 22:43:37 If oil companies can spend money and resources on alternative energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, why can't the NRA do the same to reduce our 'dependence' on guns? Would be easy to rebrand as the 'No Rifles Association' - the acronym fits like a glove!

3819 2018-03-24 22:42:51 Not only is the land being torn apart to extract the oil, it's burned afterwards and releasing that into the atmosphere. There's no defense for it's extraction other than the fact that it is what we currently use to fuel our country.

3841 2018-03-24 22:39:27 RX The proper term for a steak sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, fresh onion, oil, vinegar and saltpepperoregano is called a steak hoagie. Mayo is to a steak or hoagie as ketchup is go GorT’s hot dog.

3843 2018-03-24 22:38:56 Is it oil or vinegar? Both soak up the spice but the vinegar I think gets the hottest. I usually go for the dry spice on Thai - a nice, manageable 5-6.

3853 2018-03-24 22:37:04 a bucket strike is a pipeline failure
regardless, an oil spill is much more dangerous and long lasting than an oil or dilbit spill.
even you should know that.
3854 2018-03-24 22:36:55 Yeah, they hate “big oil”, too. Guess what faux fur is made of.
3855 2018-03-24 22:36:44 Did you add a bit of the Chinese Chili oil in it? Also try it with shredded beef.
3856 2018-03-24 22:36:37 @thejeffvibbert I was out of it last night going to bed and filled up a water to bring w me. Realized it would be sitting next to my oil diffuser and quickly switched to a cup w a lid. Thanks for the memo!
3857 2018-03-24 22:36:00 #Venezuela’s oil sector remains in the dumps to say the least. The #OPEC country’s investment pool of small-to-large capped services companies, integrated majors and national oil companies has dwindled to just a handful, if that many.

3862 2018-03-24 22:34:45 My big think is to use mass solar/wave power desalination and all of those gas/oil pipelines to transport water inland so that we can green the deserts and restore the natural water tables - but I don't think thats what your prof. is asking right?
3863 2018-03-24 22:34:45 Idiotic bald head.  After d coup  Ibb gave berger mandate to fixed abj, and  berger told him wat they wants is oil in exchange for d job. IBB desperate to leave lag obliged dem , and they embarked on massive job day and night .Fool u cables into wat u don't know

Mind you they can never rest their barbaric beliefs
3879 2018-03-24 22:33:28 The US can produce and export all of the light oil it wants as it does them no actual good.  It would not have a 20 MM bbl refining industry without Canadian medium and heavy crude oil. That is the only reason that they persistently try to land lock Canadian oil.

3887 2018-03-24 22:31:49 My car is leaking oil out of the same place as before, and that repair was rather spendy.
Whyyyy
3888 2018-03-24 22:31:47 Oh I've nothing to learn! I know fully well who is blocking pipelines! I work in the patch! Canada has a deep muskeg in the east that caters to theirs and international interests!Western oil is clean and worth billions to Canada and the wests economies!

3895 2018-03-24 22:30:35 I would agree with that but think he'll lose votes to those who will automatically give their's to Sid.

Funny how DNC tell you guns bad, oil bad , think sustainable.
They have more guns,use way more oil for their many cars and houses.
3908 2018-03-24 22:27:43 I have the second one constantly, used to it though. But a little warm olive oil in your ear
3909 2018-03-24 22:27:25 These protest organizers pay for cleanup or taxpayers get stuck with the bill?
3910 2018-03-24 22:27:21 108 I payed today! Keep burning that foreign oil and drinking the lieberal kookaid you the ones that pay for it in the end! If I was being lied to and paying that much for fuel I would begin too wonder who and why?

3913 2018-03-24 22:26:35 I’ll get the pool full of oil ready
3914 2018-03-24 22:26:29 Just the bologna, though I wouldn't put it past this town to dunk the whole thing in the oil. The terrifying part: it was DELICIOUS.

"Because I want something different" is acceptable.
"Because we're out of oil" is good.
"My burns are still recovering" works too.
I would even accept, "That's not how cake works"
3923 2018-03-24 22:24:59 BLOTUS @realDonaldTrump showing his true commitment to USA. The only commitment the fat, bloated snake oil salesman has is to himself.
3924 2018-03-24 22:24:49 Media didn't report the positive. Afraid they'd upset ScheerRebel but local papers across the country reported for their area. Like millions on Alberta oil.
3925 2018-03-24 22:24:45 Sorry what I meant was its more expensive for Australia to import oil
3926 2018-03-24 22:24:37 Ha I'd have a right laugh watching him trying to lift you above his head  and you posing up there while he was staggering all over the place like one of those weight lifters .. I'd pay good money for that

3928 2018-03-24 22:23:55 actually in the first war with Iraq america wanted the price of oil to go up world wide ......they prompted Saddam to invade an old territory Kuwait america then pretended it was protecting friends Saudi Arabia from attack by Saddam when it was all about oil prices later ...

3930 2018-03-24 22:23:42 For those people saying the march wouldn't have happened without the second amendment in the first place, false. If you knew anything about American history is was the media that gave us free speech, not guns 
3931 2018-03-24 22:23:37 Definitely.  Look up Citizens United being copied in Canada and American Koch-funded astro turf here.  Google Koch agenda.  Tons of money. Koch and lobbyists support oil.
3932 2018-03-24 22:23:36 I use the biore charcoal cleanser as well as a goats milk charcoal bar soap as an alternative :/ I just don’t know how to keep it at bay during the day, I will literally just have my eyebrows done and mascara and I can still feel the oil producing on my face w/o touching it :(
3933 2018-03-24 22:23:36 I really want some olive oil, vinegar, a dash of oregano or Italian seasoning, sprinkle of Parmesan, and bread. Sigh.
3934 2018-03-24 22:23:27 I literally just went to 3 different stores to get oregano oil  shit better work! #ihatebeingsick
3935 2018-03-24 22:23:17 I’m sure Dusty has changed it up before I just find it incredibly irritating to say that like would you tell a professional piano player to try the drums next time or an established oil painter that you can’t wait to see them sculpt something it’s just a lil petty

3945 2018-03-24 22:21:25 MREs are pretty expensive.
I think it would be better to only validate foodstamps for certain essential food groups, veggies, rice, flour, cooking oil, a little meat or fish, salt & pepper.
Not sugar, candies, pastries, chips, sodas, beer, & such luxuries...

3957 2018-03-24 22:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3958 2018-03-24 22:19:57 It's so bad so sad. I am as careful as possible never to eat palm oil. There is no justification overbloated, destructive consumerism.

3978 2018-03-24 22:17:34 Because that $10 or$12 I might be able to save in a month will cover the extra $100 on an oil bill in the winter. Am I right?

3989 2018-03-24 22:15:52 coconut oil. that’s all
3990 2018-03-24 22:15:42 In that case then the research should be split down the middle. Greed of oil vs greed of clean energy etc. so why is it so one sided in conclusion?
3991 2018-03-24 22:15:37 We closed 15 min ago...but here I am getting a speech about police BRUTALITY...BITCH BUY YOUR COT DAMN OIL AND LEAVE
3992 2018-03-24 22:15:23 Sure it is. The association is clear. R's and NRA want dead kids, have blood on hands, it's repeated over and over.
3993 2018-03-24 22:15:23 A post on Carnoustie Canine Capers Facebook page reached over 25,000 people and had 274 shares about the palm oil danger.
3994 2018-03-24 22:15:12 @HurdOnTheHill $MMEX Congressman, congratulations on having the first oil refinery built in 41 years in the State of Texas built in your district.

May you have an awesome time touring and discussing the site and project details with Jack Hanks on Monday. #FtStockton
3995 2018-03-24 22:15:00 It's almost time to go racing at Lucas Oil Stadium!
3996 2018-03-24 22:14:41 Nahhh it's puff puff, that thing be soaking up crude oil
3997 2018-03-24 22:14:38 Okay friends, how do you pronounce "oil"? (Pick the closest phonetic approximation.)

4000 2018-03-24 22:14:25 Here's the thing. Oil is cheap and contains a great deal of energy. When you develop an electric car that has a range of a thousand kilometres at -40c and is affordable then there won't be a need for pipelines. Until then there is.
4001 2018-03-24 22:14:17 there's plenty of oli --> #oil jokes about my name but i don't hear the army knocking down my door
4002 2018-03-24 22:13:59 #Nigeria in a sorry state. Now, everyone understands the game is #BiafranOil.. #TheZooIsDead! #Biafra says take the oil & give us freedom but #EU, #UK & probably #USA may not want to hear it becos #Biafra has always been a territory of groups despite #HistoricalManipulations.
4003 2018-03-24 22:13:56 #Ilovetarsands and I live on the ocean everyday oil is the biggest political tool on the planet Why? Black gold the world consumes 85 million barrels a day #everyday it isn’t going anywhere we need it why is America controlling our natural resources?

4005 2018-03-24 22:13:40 That's not true, read OIL, POLITICS  AND  VIOLENCE: NIGERIA’S  MILITARY  COUP  CULTURE (1966–1976).Please get your history right ,T. Y Danjuma didn't order the murder of Ironsi and also anyone against ethnic cleansing is and would always be a voice of reason.
4006 2018-03-24 22:13:38 Thanks for the tip!! I was planning on getting coconut oil to get rid of my split ends.
4007 2018-03-24 22:13:29 Chevy.  Chevy's are nice.  Not to jinx it but I have 197K worry-free, no-major-mechanical-problem miles on my truck.  I just change the oil, turn up the radio (to NPR news just to annoy all the kiddies because I'm older like that) and drive on.
4008 2018-03-24 22:13:29 they lubricate with oil i am pretty sure or at least some kind of systems lubrication to prevent friction damage to internal structures
4009 2018-03-24 22:13:14 It’s an EXPANSION of an existing pipeline and is safer than shipping oil by rail.... a lot of other Canadians have given up a lot more for their country in the past...this is the least BC can do for the rest of #Canada @BradWall306

4012 2018-03-24 22:12:37 Life hack 3

Moisturize. Where your skin is oily, combination, acne prone, dry, sensitive... Always moisturize. Never let your skin dehydrate, it will only make matters much worse. It does NOT help with oil control.

4014 2018-03-24 22:12:26 I need some more baby oil gel
4015 2018-03-24 22:12:17 Homemade ones are the beeest. Olive oil, coconut oil, avocado, banana, whipped cream... I’ve tried it all. If you’re using oil make sure to get your hair damp before you put it on, or the oil will lock in the dryness
4016 2018-03-24 22:12:02 Well while you're at it could you change my oil  
4017 2018-03-24 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

4020 2018-03-24 22:11:04 So sorry. I have oil to heat our house. Its not any cheaper sadly.
4021 2018-03-24 22:10:54 I had a terrifying experience! I went outside to start the grill to do some brats. I lifted the lid to see a mixture 5-15 red wasps and yellow jackets. My heart was racing as I slammed down the lid and ran inside. 

Did some brats on the stove with some coconut oil instead....
4022 2018-03-24 22:10:50 No, I’d like to know how many millions of people our government has killed in just the past 14 years with Bush and Obama killing children for oil. (the same government you want to control all the guns)
4023 2018-03-24 22:10:47 Finding out my car has an oil leak. Damn...
4024 2018-03-24 22:10:37 Need to reup on peppermint oil - a walk to the vitamin shoppe for this evenings walk. Fun fact... spiders avoid peppermint oil. It kills them. Mix with water... spray in corners. Idk about roaches. They got superpowers n shit.

4031 2018-03-24 22:09:22 Thank Northern Democrats for 3/5 status. That was compromise to them giving you 0.

4034 2018-03-24 22:08:38 I can't forget his interview when he mentioned how he was taking money in Ghana-must-go bags to OBJ during 1999 elections. This was when late President Yar'Adua took away his oil bloc. I also recall how Jonathan made him chairman of PAC.
4035 2018-03-24 22:08:37 Righties and research is like oil and water.
4036 2018-03-24 22:08:19 Very true Senator Bruce! Only few Nigerians have been allotted Oil blocks! Danjuma has spoken the truth about ethnic cleansing but he is not the yardstick for patriotism.
4037 2018-03-24 22:08:15 ACV rinse, hot oil treatment. protein treatment, deep condition, detangle, leave in conditioner, oil, cream, style. like.. ugh 
4038 2018-03-24 22:08:07 UST curve wud be steepening and real yields wud be much higher. Libor rising due to a cny oil contract is stretching it imo
4039 2018-03-24 22:07:51 Ship them to the oil patch and they will get straightened around.
4040 2018-03-24 22:07:47 good thing i had off today so that i could manically attempt to clean my house and accomplish nothing. 
4041 2018-03-24 22:07:36 One part coffee grounds, one part sugar, one part coconut oil. Mix and scrub it all over your body
4042 2018-03-24 22:07:32 I’m sure the only tears they shed were ones from laughter over your pathetic attempt at getting attention.  #safergunlaws
4043 2018-03-24 22:07:22  - But it’s true.. they’ve fermented unrest/anarchy wherever they’ve chased their obsession with oil.
4044 2018-03-24 22:07:03 Bill are you still in my dad's closet . They made a oil can Henry,s after your name . Called o rileys
4045 2018-03-24 22:06:43 And big oil is literally a Wikipedia level term used on both sides of the ledger. It’s a positive and a negative depending.
4046 2018-03-24 22:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
4047 2018-03-24 22:06:27 or maybe... The Gandhi – vegan full English. Tomatoes, mushrooms, avocado, tofu, asparagus, red onion, lemon, thyme, homemade baked beans, sourdough toast with olive oil £9.50

4051 2018-03-24 22:05:45 I’ve never tried a night oil, sure does sound nice 
4052 2018-03-24 22:05:42 The oil man in the hood done stepped it up. He got a bomb oil deal, bagged in a gift bag and gave me a business card
4053 2018-03-24 22:05:32 crude oil price might have something to do with war haws circeling around Trumps cabinet and s&p might have a dirrect opposite corelation so... hm.. just a thought
4054 2018-03-24 22:05:14 If it's about oil blocks,what about the ones gifted to Alakija,Indimi amongst many others.If OBJ and TY should be quiet,then do you have the international clout and gravitas to speak for us,and protect the thousands of poor Nigerians being murdered by herdsmen every day.Oga I beg
4055 2018-03-24 22:04:55 ولا عليك إلا من الله تعالى وواثق الخطى يمشي ملكا
4056 2018-03-24 22:04:47 need to massage my scalp but my oil mixture is in the bathroom. 
4057 2018-03-24 22:04:35 What’s cool is when you take your car in for a oil change and they surprise you with new windshield wipers at no extra costs and no one tells you that they changed them. It was a great surprise when I went to clean my windshield and it cleaned the whole window spotless. Blessed.
4058 2018-03-24 22:04:29 And what has happened to the careers of those who have raised objections? And again, when you use trigger terms like “Big Oil” you obliterate any claim of objectivity in science or journalism, which is a prerequisite of both.
4059 2018-03-24 22:04:26 I believe you are grandstanding rather than making good sound environmental decisions. The pipeline will keep oil trucks off our highways and make some $ that you need for your huge wish list. Now try to get some leg to increase % of electric cars.
4060 2018-03-24 22:04:16 Let's make more progress. It's time to devote @POTUS #Government resources to sustainable energy, so we can stop being at the mercy of dangerous oil based or nuclear power #EarthHour
4061 2018-03-24 22:04:15 This oil change is taking forever 
4062 2018-03-24 22:04:11 Gotta-get-every-ounce! LOL

4065 2018-03-24 22:03:47 "Progressives" (& even some misguided conservatives) assume blithely that social media must B regulated--but why? Governments typically regulate things that R considered a life's necessity--electricity, oil & gas, civic infrastructure, food. But social media is not a necessity...
4066 2018-03-24 22:03:37 Getting my oil changed and the guys like “you ever seen the movie save the last dance, you look just like her” aka Julia Stiles. The other guy goes “nah the girl from blue crush for sure”. Taking a pole now
4067 2018-03-24 22:03:25 hope you get that all important picture
4068 2018-03-24 22:03:24 Reality check. Pull out a map, over 95% of LA electricity comes from 100’s miles away. At night over 99%. If those lines are lost any reason city is dark. Where is your plan “B” for power? Coal, oil or nuclear?
4069 2018-03-24 22:03:15 This seems like something someone with a basic culinary background might attempt. You don’t even know bacon won’t be crispy if cooked in a pan in the oven or that you can reuse oil.

4077 2018-03-24 22:01:20 I just finished reading Max Siollun's Oil, Politics and Violence. Then T. Y Danjuma came up with his speech.1966 is playing all over again. The thing with Nigeria is that we find a way to deny history and end up repeating it.
4078 2018-03-24 22:01:09 I didn't see this in target today.. Looking for a face oil for aging. I was using squalane oil. Will your compare?
4079 2018-03-24 22:01:03 When you share our oil well to Individuals.

4089 2018-03-24 22:00:22 is too many unemployed to produce anything,  and too many rich get interest rate. and too many chines production in the market. and above all much of oil revenue get wasted in the proxy war in the middle east. so where is  the investment ?
4090 2018-03-24 21:59:50 Might be a good time to re-read Oil, Politics and Violence by @maxsiollun.
4091 2018-03-24 21:59:44 Texas is still riding the oil boom but has much more poverty, worse public services, and a weaker economy than New York. Again, give me a policy.
4092 2018-03-24 21:59:32 Correct me if I'm wrong but don't american oil tankers run up and down the west coast from the lover 48 to Alaska?
4093 2018-03-24 21:59:30 P.S. Venezuela has greater oil reserves than Saudi Arabia and its closer.
4094 2018-03-24 21:59:23 Engr. who panicked u like this??
4095 2018-03-24 21:59:18 Need the Canadians who don't live in the Praries to shut the fuck up and allow the oil pipeline tobe built.
Canada's going to shit and our Pretty boy priminister doesn't give a shit.

4099 2018-03-24 21:58:47 Been searching for jamaican castor oil for my dreads i cnt find it at local clicks
4100 2018-03-24 21:58:41 But Canada won't refine and use its own oil.  Canada would rather leave Alberta to rot with its oil, at least under current leadership.  It's an interesting theory, but I don't think it would work.
4101 2018-03-24 21:58:38 The state has been nicer to him than me. If he does more, it is pro rata. I wish I was gifted oil blocks
4102 2018-03-24 21:58:35 Joe, give her that oil bloc you just got. Lol

Impressive creativity to this young generation.  Kudos to them.
4103 2018-03-24 21:58:27 Also, many capitalist/socially democratic societies have had a MUCH lower poverty rate than Venezuela. These countries need to not rely too much on steady oil prices if they want to have secure social programs
4104 2018-03-24 21:58:19 Vouchers 4 charter schools will never cover full cost of tuition & brick & mortar. Eventually, those attending charters will hav 2 pay a 
fee over & above. We end up with have’s vs have not’s...like Louisiana. Who wants that? Oh yeah, the West Texas Oil magnates. Goofy.

It was only Tea Tree oil but I know what I thought when it was said 
4106 2018-03-24 21:58:11 Which of Carter's policies caused OPEC's oil embargo? I asked for specifics.
4107 2018-03-24 21:58:10 Ohno more oil hahahaha the unionists wont be happy
4108 2018-03-24 21:57:55 My personality isn’t for everyone, it can be like trying to mix water and oil, it dosent go.
4109 2018-03-24 21:57:47 Mr. President that has the integrity and owns no oil block, we can all see how competent the man is, and how he has improved the fortunes of Nigerians. We have seen how he's been in charge and led from front. 
4110 2018-03-24 21:57:40 I have to laugh when I see pharmaceutical company commercials patting themselves on the back. It's like when the oil companies do it.
4111 2018-03-24 21:57:26 Military paid for traitor Chelsea's oil change .

4117 2018-03-24 21:56:25 Roasted veggies are awesome. A little oil. A little salt. A hot oven. Tasty goodness.
4118 2018-03-24 21:56:23 Will there be oil or whipped cream?
4119 2018-03-24 21:56:15  petrolium. He shoulda stuck with oil.
4120 2018-03-24 21:55:43 Trying rosehip oil again. Two things -

1. It STINKS.
2. I can literally feel dozens of fresh spots growing since I applied it lmao.
4121 2018-03-24 21:55:40 How does that drastically affect us? We have other sources of oil, they still have to sell it at a market rate. If we chose to sanction them instead of paying their prices, that would hurt us more if we were so concerned about their oil supply??!
4122 2018-03-24 21:54:46 I flow like water, some people repre$ent oil. We could never mix.
4123 2018-03-24 21:54:19 Ah ,yes, bangs, they are so cute...yes. :as it soaks up ALL the oil from my forehead:
4124 2018-03-24 21:54:17 So your argument is she can't protest one oil project if she flew on a plane that uses fuel? I think May realizes the practical use of oil such as transport, but doesn't approve of every project. Two opposing thoughts in one brain are cool. Try it.
4125 2018-03-24 21:53:57 #OzTouristProblems Some guy in a tin man suit will try to get ya to oil him up I didn't mind but he didn't call the next day
4126 2018-03-24 21:53:31 The swayed by money argument is truly laughable; big oil is waiting to pay the first climate scientist with sound refuting research millions and millions of dollars. He/she would also rise to fame. Be they don’t, because it’s not a defensible position.
4127 2018-03-24 21:53:30 [t] they don't put oil in shit its all dry and crusty I need something packed with salt.
4128 2018-03-24 21:53:26 @SenateGOP all these liberal protest gun rights via @AMarch4OurLives secretly have oil on their properties. Let fuel or @USMC with crayons and teach them a lesson!
4129 2018-03-24 21:53:20 Unfortunately, all of Iran’s resources(Oil, minerals, etc) are in the dirty hands of the mullah’s regime. Why can’t these supporters be bought by the regime with even more money? Its called having principles and dignity values that @tparsi and @jrezaian never have heard of.
4130 2018-03-24 21:52:58 Yeye @renoomokri Sacrifice ke? When supervised the brutal killing of Gen. Aguiyi Ironsi. He got an Oil blocks worth about $2billion for a chicken $500 million He foisted OBJ @OOFoundation on us. Making reference to one of the crooks that left Nigeria in ruins
4131 2018-03-24 21:52:55 It had more to with Chavez and Maduro nationalizing Venezuelan oil and using the profits from their oil to help reduce poverty by 50%, a figure no capitalist nation can boast of achieving.
4132 2018-03-24 21:52:46 Lol 
4133 2018-03-24 21:52:46 The  has moved on since 1970s so the saudis must now b interested in trading oil direct with eg china rather than being tied 2 US dollars?
4134 2018-03-24 21:52:43 Dash me the oil na
4135 2018-03-24 21:52:42 Venezuela failed because the oil price collapsed.

Why didn't you mention the UK, Sweden, Iceland, Japan, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium etc? Because they are more liberal, and they are better in nearly every metric imaginable.
4136 2018-03-24 21:52:28 @opa1420 The invasion was always about the long term control of oil Bruce. Same as our 'helping' East Timor was about the gas.
4137 2018-03-24 21:52:19 I was supposed to write a paper this afternoon before going out and instead I ate a bag of raisinets(xxl), made homemade essential oil fabric softeners and carpet deodorizer and talked on the phone for hours. Great work, weirdo.

4148 2018-03-24 21:49:57 What landfill will they end up in at the end of thier life cycle in 15-25 yrs? Looks like alot of waste there. And you're worried about plastic bags? Gonna need a significant amount of oil to produce them. Hmm, wonder where all the oil will come from. #albertastrong#oilforlife
4149 2018-03-24 21:49:29 a lot of nail oil and laziness cos i don’t do anything
4150 2018-03-24 21:48:17 Legit I use Castile soap and coconut oil  I use Thayers witch hazel as a toner after I wash my face and that’s it. I gotta keep it simple or my skin will hate me 
4151 2018-03-24 21:48:08 What happened to cutting spending, not wasting  money on the Middle East, we don't even get the oil. Early on I had the feeling he was going to win and now I"m getting a sick feeling. Reagan blamed Carter for six years. Trump owns the market and deficits like a boss.

4156 2018-03-24 21:47:41 Why did DJ consequence dye his hair like that  looking like rat that fell inside oil #BBNaija
4157 2018-03-24 21:47:29 And they will be wrong as the same Malthusian estimates of “peak oil”, end of water and mass unemployment were in the past.

Remember that if we believed in those experts, we ran out of coal, oil, jobs and water ten years ago.
4158 2018-03-24 21:47:21 I used African black soap and witch hazel and vitamin e oil i stopped using the soap and vitamin e oil cause that’s the only thing i changes but now it just won’t go away
4159 2018-03-24 21:47:20 They only annoying thing is, all these 1966 men will die and lose their oil billions to foreign banks & governments.

Nigeria won't see any of the money...
4160 2018-03-24 21:47:17 canola oil is still annoying
4161 2018-03-24 21:47:07 @OlenkabetseM A portion of Libya’s oil sales was credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens, as a form of dividend and for 40 loaves of bread, one would only pay the equivalent of 15 US cents. Electricity was free in Libya, which meant no electricity bills.
4162 2018-03-24 21:47:05 Human causes: There is no black carbon from natural gas or oil. Only from coal - and very little. It is the 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE without electricity. It's also partly from imbeciles purposely setting forest fires.
4163 2018-03-24 21:46:51 Yes, a little dispute over nesting territory. The one who fires the most fishy stomach oil is the winner
4164 2018-03-24 21:46:47 Mozzarella is always nice . But I just make it with Olive oil white vinegar salt and pepper and sometimes a little basil .
4165 2018-03-24 21:46:45 I’ve never tried the oil, but I’ve smoked CBD flower and it was nice. It’s completely a body high; your mind isn’t fuzzy whatsoever. You’re 100% functional.

4171 2018-03-24 21:45:35 Go to the grocery store and get Goof Off or Goo Gone. It's an orange oil and it works fabulously for stickers. First, take off what you can, like the shiny bits, and even if there's white stuff left over, the Goo Gone will penetrate.

4179 2018-03-24 21:44:21 We dont need ARs huh? Just wait... ima tell the government you have oil in your house, once they take it over... you will wish you had one

4220 2018-03-24 21:39:24 For starters, he wouldn’t have been putting Alberta Oil to shame his first year into office. Second, he wouldn’t be rolling over to the federal government the same way the NDPs are. Too much to list and not enough characters.
4221 2018-03-24 21:39:23 You're right, it will carry crude oil, but it will also carry refined oil products such as gasoline in the same way the existing pipeline does. Trans-mountain is a unique pipeline in that it transports both crude and refined products. The expansion will increase gas supply in yvr
4222 2018-03-24 21:39:12 Same politicians beholden to @nra are beholden to the oil/gas/coal industries. Getting rid of them for this issue changes many issues including healthcare, immigration and renewables.

4268 2018-03-24 21:31:05 Had a bad migraine last night and took too much 3:1 CBD oil. Slept for 10 hours, woke up to an outline for a piece proposing an aerial tramway to solve Bay Area transit problems.
4269 2018-03-24 21:31:04 Baobab oil truly saved my skin today

4271 2018-03-24 21:30:20 Oh I didn’t mean it like that! you said the oil wasn’t coming off and affecting the paint job. It’s not the painters fault if they are provided something faulty to paint on.

4274 2018-03-24 21:30:07 Such a productive day! I got an oil change, went grocery shopping, cleaned my fish tank, & bought a dresser & nightstand today!
4275 2018-03-24 21:29:54 @Miguel are those dreads if so what kinda oil u use #AskMiguel 
4276 2018-03-24 21:29:54 no! just the oil!
4277 2018-03-24 21:29:47 @Wolfiesmom love show but pls don’t use plastic bag to coat potatoes with oil! Bowl fine. Ocean users will thank u 4 less plastic waste!
4278 2018-03-24 21:29:06 Even Bessie doesn't want to be disturbed until next year, all she wants now is an oil change and preventive maintenance!
4279 2018-03-24 21:28:55 All President Donald Trump has to do is get China to agree to cut North  Korea's 30% oil to 15% for one week then to 7.5% a second week and3.25% a third week till  North Korea agrees to enter into talks to denucliarize the Pacific Rim .
4280 2018-03-24 21:28:55 I just cried off all of my expensive face oil and now I’m just mad
4281 2018-03-24 21:28:51 Snake oil once more?
4282 2018-03-24 21:28:50 For every instance you’re talking about, there is a better explanation and there are many examples where the US never got involved in countries’ isolationist affairs. To be somewhat fair if oil was ever a consideration in US policy (other than Iraq) OPEC is a cartel
4283 2018-03-24 21:28:48 Anyone: *starts a sentence with an O*

4284 2018-03-24 21:28:29 Nominated but not in serious contention. My guess is it will be McDavid, Hall, MacKinnon, Giroux and Kucherov who are nominated.
4285 2018-03-24 21:28:24 About oil, true. But re-fueling the AA? That was a Soviet-style robbery of one industry via revenue tax, justified with words “royalty” and “non-renewable” (looks like the time frame for oil shows it never was non-renewable), redistribution of wealth. It’s gone forever. #cdnpoli
4286 2018-03-24 21:28:12 Coconut oil got my skin feelin some kinda way 
4287 2018-03-24 21:27:59 ...less than 35 years later...on this horrid day in 1989...the Exxon Valdez spilled 240,000 barrels or 11 million gallons of oil into the then pristine waters of Prince William Sound... =/

4290 2018-03-24 21:27:04 OK, but why d'you think Troika et al wish to remain influential? No strategic interests in SS (oil is very minor league).  Principal reason is so as to protect humanitarian/development inputs, undermined/wasted on a/c of senseless conflict.
4291 2018-03-24 21:26:57 also changed the oil in big boi againa nd i'm gonna have to take a look at one of his headlights soon, but it turns out that i actually love the feeling of working on my own vehicle so it doesnt bother me too much
4292 2018-03-24 21:26:36 Oil?
4293 2018-03-24 21:26:34 I was supposed to get a safety check, get my oil changed, chart, clean, and do my taxes all this morning. But these allergies messed me TF up!
4294 2018-03-24 21:26:17 I could help but notice, you seem to be a climate change believer.  Would it interest you to know that Judge William Alsup of the California Federal District Court has ruled that the cities of San Francisco and Oakland did not prove their case against the 5 big oil companies???
4295 2018-03-24 21:26:16 hell yeah.... consistent weed smoke smell is probably one of my fav smells. im gonna try and build an incense/essential oil smell 4 my room
4296 2018-03-24 21:26:15 Well. The Prime Minister of Canada came in on an environmental platform and tricked the people of Canada. Then promoted 'dirty' oil of Canada... #kindermorgan #cdnpoli @JustinTrudeau

4341 2018-03-24 21:19:14 I thot this old ass lady put down 3 bottles of Jager on the checkstand & I was like dAaYyumM mood asf but it turned out to be olive oil
4342 2018-03-24 21:19:12 I did a paper on this in grad school. It really isn’t even fair to compare. But you know big oil has an agenda.
4343 2018-03-24 21:19:04 Did my oil change, cleaned the car up, and now I’m just trying to smoke some good kush

4351 2018-03-24 21:18:02 What happens when the proven oil reserves propping up welfare that are funding their welfare in the Nordic Consitutional Monarchies runs out?

4352 2018-03-24 21:17:51 So on our way to @WaltDisneyWorld, Noah's oil switch breaks. We stop and eat lunch and it leaks out until it's basically empty. So now we are renting a car from the Atlanta airport... I just want to be at Disney world already.

4356 2018-03-24 21:15:49 With the amount of money that had flowed through Aberdeen since the discovery of oil in the North Sea, it borders on criminal how under-developed, uncultured and unready for the future Aberdeen is. The word Progress must be missing from ACC dictionaries
4357 2018-03-24 21:15:43 He lacks allot in the environmental department I agree

4363 2018-03-24 21:15:10 I just got finished with the Ultra Cell meeting with the founder of Zilis. The CBD hemp oil is growing exponentially in the next few years. If you want to get in and either just supplement your income or possibly even make a career out of it, please message me.
4364 2018-03-24 21:14:55 Oil doesn't work that way.  Turns into goey clumps.  Bittamin sinks to the bottom and sits. 

I do need to know what's under the pipeline.  The KM guy said it was one thing and you're telling me it's something different. 

What's under there?
4365 2018-03-24 21:14:46 'Asserting' is trying to be clever by half. Generals are not known to 'assert', they are known to call a spade a spade, not a farming instrument. He didn't 'assert' when he told Jonathan off. Is he afraid he may lose his oil block if he calls Buhari out?

4372 2018-03-24 21:13:22 Several oil companies voted with their dollars long ago: getting into the solar and wind industries. Their words said something different, but their dollars seemed to indicate they knew what was up.
4373 2018-03-24 21:13:21 At this point I just want to know why every time I eat any kind of food I always get oil on my lips like say I dey use mouth fry puff puff
4374 2018-03-24 21:13:04 Olbas oil.... a few drops in wax in a wax warmer.... try it
4375 2018-03-24 21:13:02 We need more refineries in BC not just more oil. The lack of refineries is too often overlooked 
Lower mainland gets most all its gas from one aging refinery for example which couldn't refine any more oil even if there was more
4376 2018-03-24 21:13:02 2. It might be something in your diet   3. The cocnut oil isn't organic         4.Coconut oil might not be right for your skin type in large quantities or just not on your face.
4377 2018-03-24 21:12:54 That was a bad play on the Monty Python joke, but my wife makes a German potato salad that is wonderful. Oil and white basalmic vinegar based, with onions, served warm or cold. No mayo or other stuff like that. If I can find a decent recipe I'll DM you.
4378 2018-03-24 21:12:45 According to the state of Idaho I must be a "drug dealer." I sued Idaho for the right to use cannabis in the Holy oil as a requirement of my faith. I give it to the sick as Jesus commanded his disciples to do. It heals so much..it's still a miracle. Paddock v. Gov. Otter

4384 2018-03-24 21:11:43 It is even less equipped to do so now. Particularly with oil prices much lower than they were just a few short years ago. Oil is the Russians' main export.
4385 2018-03-24 21:11:40 This contrast between CA as either practicing black magic or peddling snake oil to desperate politicos is unhelpful. Practically speaking, all it needed to be was a slightly more efficient turnout machine than traditional methods to make a difference in a close race.
4386 2018-03-24 21:11:39 I'm sure there will be some of those, hehe.

4391 2018-03-24 21:10:49 Do you have a set list of charts that you look at every day, week and month? How do you end up looking at this particular chart. It seems like you must have looked at thousands of charts before getting to oil priced in AUD.
4392 2018-03-24 21:10:45 Yay coconut oil, ew soy milk :)
4393 2018-03-24 21:10:39 Thanks, when I move I might be able to do arts on stream. But right now I watch stuff while I work.

And I would have to oil up my loom as well since it squeaks a lot
4394 2018-03-24 21:10:35 Midnight Oil would be an awesome headliner. Not stale in the least.

So the oil may have become slightly diluted. 
4411 2018-03-24 21:07:23 (2/2) a continuing low price of #oil has meant the need for the #MiddleEast|ern country to #reform its #economy so that the same economy works better for that country’s residents.  Whether the reforms will actually benefit #Saudi residents still remains to be seen. #cdnpoli

4417 2018-03-24 21:06:01 The ingredients are super simple, I'll just need a wok/deep fryer. And some sunflower oil or the like. 

Beaver tails are just one of many Canuck delicacies. I'll have to introduce you to poutine sometime!

4426 2018-03-24 21:04:46 The area has been subjected to western interference after the oil rush but the Arab Spring that destabilised the region was genuine and countered by genuine evil in Syria. Concessions to multi party democracy would not have killed Assad or his backers.
4427 2018-03-24 21:04:33 Indeed, and Flood Geology has been a boon to oil exploration ... not!

4429 2018-03-24 21:04:17 Can we not make it an aim to replace plastic made from oil to plastic made from hemp. It’s biodegradable. Why aren’t we talking about this more?
4430 2018-03-24 21:04:15 Can't seem to find an earl grey that has actual bergamot pieces. Is that a requirement? Is the oil good enough? Or can you rec a brand?
4431 2018-03-24 21:03:59 Can they stop putting palm oil in foods, especially in foods that can be vegan except without the palm oil. Thanks
4432 2018-03-24 21:03:54 All good, T. It is complicated. Perhaps refining and serving our own would help for starters. I believe there's also enough conventional oil to serve us w/o having to rip up the earth for dirty tarsands to make the oil giants richer.

4441 2018-03-24 21:02:35 This is sad that anybody so called civilised people can do this to another human being, but I have serious reservations as to what is tolerated in some parts of Africa, phoney elections,dictatorships and guerrilla militias exterminating innocent villagers,no oil so nobody cares
4442 2018-03-24 21:02:33 Oil is Texas's gold and we allowed them to drill but created laws to define HOW they could do so. Yes. FB & several others have always been known to be derelict in their duty but as heinous as the medium is, let it exist under strict regulatory penalties & charge some people.

4475 2018-03-24 20:57:36 So I’ve done the research but different people have used different formulas like I would go with the lemon coconut oil and turmeric powder but some people used sugar and milk or yogurt. What you using?
4476 2018-03-24 20:57:22 We’re told to care about an Iran deal, foreign oil, and Chinese steel but not about the appeal for our lives ended by gun violence. Nobody wants to be shot; No Student, No Black person, No Cop... No One.  We need to re-evaluate our system of systems.
4477 2018-03-24 20:57:19 Why not hire a salvage company to clean it up? We can drill oil from below the ocean floor, so obviously we have the technology to clean up floating garbage.

4480 2018-03-24 20:56:54 This is a very good and important point: USA access to relatively cheap oil from Alberta enables US oil producers to seek more lucrative export markets, and it's more proof that KM TMPL expansion is economically viable and even necessary for #abpoli #bcpoli

4492 2018-03-24 20:54:32 I agree that the immediate source is oil. But essentially all life on this planet is solar and water powered. Oil and coal are derived from buried organic material and all organic matter cannot thrive without sunlight  or water.

4494 2018-03-24 20:54:28 Agree with that BUT data is Facebook’s gold/oil and their own collections use of data to target is dubious/questionable before you question the process around protecting data leakage. There has been many rumours of them using the microphone on phone to better enhance targeting.

4498 2018-03-24 20:54:15 seems not! which i guess makes sense-- part of why i like it is that it's significantly cheaper than most arches paper (like under $15 for a 12x16" pad?) and meant for oil paint, where little of the paper would presumably be visible in a finished piece

4500 2018-03-24 20:54:15 Would gold have value in that world though? I’d say only things like food, oil, weapons, and legit industrial weapons would have value then... Gold’s industrial use-value isn’t even as extensive as silver or platinum

4523 2018-03-24 20:51:19 Russell Norman promotes extracting resources (to make batteries), to offset extracting resources (oil).
Material extraction to make battery technology is infinitely worse on the environment than oil, both pre and post-processing.

4536 2018-03-24 20:49:47 That shit is nasty. Floating colonies of bacteria. In water soluble oil. A friend once let his coolant sumps go off like that. He wondered why he was sick all the time. Infections on his hands, breathing coolant mist...
4537 2018-03-24 20:49:44 Im a vietnam veteran and ive worked in the Texas oil fields since coming home. Whats your real job? Customer service? Call center?
4538 2018-03-24 20:49:40 Man I can't believe what these youtubers do I saw a video where thus chef took out a dead birds leg outside of the freezer and put it in boiling hot oil and he later literally are it
Like disgusting right
And to top that he had this fish on his dinner table that he chop up & ate
4539 2018-03-24 20:49:39 CONSEQUENTIALLY, I  AM NOT CONSEQUENTLY FEELING THIS DJ CONSEQUENCES WITH HIS INCONSEQUENTIAL RAT WEY FALL FOR OIL HAIR.......  DULL PARTY SO FAR..........#BBNaija________SAPELE BOY

4541 2018-03-24 20:49:01 Cries as I hand my car dealership $75.00 for the oil change I’ve been putting off for 6 months.
4542 2018-03-24 20:48:59 Let me guess: a guava berry halal gluten-casein free cerial bar emucified in hemp oil?

Yummy.
4543 2018-03-24 20:48:35 :(((( an oil change shouldn’t take that long!!
4544 2018-03-24 20:48:30 @EngdahlFW: The world isn't running out of #oil; it's running into it.

4545 2018-03-24 20:48:18 It took me 42 million hours to make breakfast because I'm deathly afraid of oil popping on me
4546 2018-03-24 20:48:08 Don't forget the environment. High oil prices makes solar and wind more competitive.
4547 2018-03-24 20:48:06 People are pushing however the basis for that industry is oil, it’s damn near impossible to get them out the paint
4548 2018-03-24 20:47:57 Ubuhle bendoda zinkomo zayo kwahhhhhhh oil n water lol.
4549 2018-03-24 20:47:48 это не поговорка, а цитата Пушкина из «Онегина». И у неё обратный смысл.
4550 2018-03-24 20:47:34 I miss you my friendjust dat abuti deliver oil wants us to fight mxm
4551 2018-03-24 20:47:34 That guy's butt rot. If I want an aquarium on wheels, I'm going to need to burn the midnight oil.
4552 2018-03-24 20:47:26 WOW

They are responsible for the rot we're in today from sharing ND oil proceeds with the evil Britain

4556 2018-03-24 20:46:38 And also they be using some of everything as lube from baby oil (which destroys condoms) to baby lotion and olive oil
4557 2018-03-24 20:46:33 Is Dann being deliberately 'naive'. Jobs in the oil and gas industry won't be lost overnight, we will still have them as we can't pull out of existing contracts. @NZQandA
4558 2018-03-24 20:46:29 So I have a fractured cusp, which is why my tooth hates me.  Another appointment on Monday.  I'm armed with Sensodyne toothpaste, clove oil and painkillers. Roll on Monday x  x
4559 2018-03-24 20:46:25 So the bill reads; all Trump products are free from TARIFFS!! THIS sounds like the 300 mile per gallon carburetor, that the oil companies bought and won't bring to market!  ALL BS!
4560 2018-03-24 20:46:06 One of my suspected Billionaires also oil magnates involved in the payment of Millions to Cambridge Analytica before the 2015 elections has just spoken. Okay o, We dey sidon look.

4564 2018-03-24 20:45:23 AMERICANS have a CONSTITUTION, that is all the discussion needed, and your band of self-righteous little soldiers are not going to infringe.. Why not go to work in the oil field where real men work and learn to deal with life and hard conditions. Oh, you're too little.
4565 2018-03-24 20:45:19 Corrin - the sky won’t fall in if we stop burning oil and gas
4566 2018-03-24 20:45:05 Glass packs, muffler tips, air filter, oil change..growing up is hard
4567 2018-03-24 20:45:05 Like oil
4568 2018-03-24 20:45:02 Finding it hard to breathe again. That is why I'm always used to sniffing heavy medicated oil. The strong smell brings me back and calms me. 

#anxiety
4569 2018-03-24 20:45:01 Thanks for that. I think that’s the big debate, isn’t it? What do we actually need/what can we get from our diet - and what’s total snake oil? Thanks for the vid link.
4570 2018-03-24 20:44:49 I must keep you in suspense because I don't want to get it wrong and it's a very very long title and I've just taken my make-up off with oil 
4571 2018-03-24 20:44:29 All the Craft Beer Dads are out at Home Sense today and I’m like, “Hello, my dudes! Beard oil and charcuterie boards and Old Fashioneds and the warmth of music on vinyl!”
4572 2018-03-24 20:44:21 Note to all dog lovers. Give your dog a small dose of C60 in olive oil and she'll be with you a lot longer. Lab rats in the studies lived at least double their normal lifespan. 
4573 2018-03-24 20:44:08 Lol she is one to talk! She just figured it out now that the carbon tax is in place that her cash cow is to sell oil, and lots of it!!! More oil sales equals more tax collected 
4574 2018-03-24 20:44:06 I realize you don't really want a real answer but it's because existing pipeline is full, local refinery demand exceeds supply so Alaskan oil is being tankered in, and Alberta needs better access to export mkts other than USA where demand is rising despite #climate false alarmism
4575 2018-03-24 20:43:57 actually you still do have argan oil it’s just spilt in the bag
4576 2018-03-24 20:43:54 So how much oil has USA gotten out of Iraq by now, anyway?
4577 2018-03-24 20:43:53 @ToyotaHollywood Disappointed that I was charged for an engine deposit cleaning additive which is not even listed in the maintenance schedule for my Prius-C, especially since I already paid for engine oil change.
4578 2018-03-24 20:43:53 I just wanted an oil change that’s all i wanted...why is it taking so long

4580 2018-03-24 20:43:45 Still doesn't answer my questions. 

But the one I'm interested to know is...

Where's the other 10% they didn't recover.    It's concrete under the pipes.  

We're missing oil.  10% of 250 thousand is 25 thousand litters missing. 

We know 70 thousand made it into the inlet.
4581 2018-03-24 20:43:33 Found some legit sweet grass oil. The smell doesn't last long but for the time it lasts it's amazing.
4582 2018-03-24 20:43:30 Just cook down a tin of tomatoes, add a little sugar, garlic & olive oil when thickened. Spread over base ( keep away from the edges)
4583 2018-03-24 20:43:29 Burning the midnight oil just so you can have a peaceful Sunday and a less blue Monday.
4584 2018-03-24 20:43:29 Sad for long-suffering Oil fans esp seeing Pens, Black Hawks success and now the Leafs rebuilding.
4585 2018-03-24 20:43:21 @TuckerGoodrich do omega 3 supps actually work? I eat a ton of grain fed beef on ZC & dandruff gets worse so assuming it’s a 6:3 imb. I don’t really like salmon, do fish oil or krill oil supplements actually work or do I need real food? I don’t like taste of Grassfed beef either

4589 2018-03-24 20:42:31 Not at all creepy.....or unsanitary. Gun oil mixes well with bacon fat.

4594 2018-03-24 20:41:35 Would you go through US land If the pipeline needed to traverse it without their consent? Why not? You need the oil right? Go around it or transport it without pipelines and do not abuse defenseless people.

4596 2018-03-24 20:41:28 That's good to know. I need to check the final drive oil on this as I don't know when it was last checked as we bought it recently and only just started using it.
4597 2018-03-24 20:41:24 Over reaching your argument, the demand for oil is not curtailed if Canada restricts extraction. Oil brings jobs to our geologists and engineers as they develop cleaner extraction to benefit everyone. That money is better spent here than Saudi or Venezuela
4598 2018-03-24 20:41:22 Ignorance is bliss. Delusion is euphoric. And that GOP trick of getting them to vote against their own interest is special.

If you can listen to trump speak and not think, "Gawd, he's an idiot!"
You're an idiot
you've been had by a con-man.

Hint: the snake oil doesn't work.

4604 2018-03-24 20:40:10 Scrap the carbon tax set up an organization like SoCred era BCHydro was to extract pipe and refine BCs own oil and to sell it to British Columbians build more refineries in BC and more pipelines for BC oil within BC. Call it BCFuel or something
4605 2018-03-24 20:40:09 if you include their export of oil, probably one of top dirtiest carbon emitters per capita

4607 2018-03-24 20:39:45 @elonmusk have you ever considered colonization or commercialization in coastal waters beyond what is done today by commercial oil?
4608 2018-03-24 20:39:43 Pretty proud of these Activated Charcoal Soaps I made today. They’re made from a shea base, best for skin, and scented in Rosewood and Saffron. The whipped topping contains Tea Tree oil and Coarse Dead Sea Salt for max skin benefit.

4614 2018-03-24 20:38:26 i can't recall who said it but this is maybe the explanation for the Fermi Paradox - alien civs reached this state and also had no good solutions. Eventually Peak Oil, or whatever resource they use, comes along amidst the chaos and there is no more effort put into SETI like stuff
4615 2018-03-24 20:37:48 Nice to get some good news that the engine in my truck is clean and no leaks. Oil pan gasket was starting to leak but got that taken care of right away. Not bad for a 19 year old @toyota truck. :)
4616 2018-03-24 20:37:43 ? it has oil and other resources. the pipeline has been contentious for a while

4619 2018-03-24 20:36:16 Where are the "Freedom Fries" Republicans when we need them? They lead no resistance to Russia. Let's boycott all we can from Russia until Putin let's up on Donald. No more Luke Oil, no Russian music, opera, or ballet-a democratic response.

Let’s Goan return the dragon oil and collect our money
4621 2018-03-24 20:36:09 Exploration. So basically 1. If we can't find anyone to privately build refineries extract northern BC oil and pipe it to the new refineries we build it all ourselves 2. We get control of our waters back from the Feds 3. We deport the insane enviros back to Ontario and Washington
4622 2018-03-24 20:36:00 Gowon,Obasanjo,TY #Danjuma and the rest of their northwestern political estab. were busy gifting themselves oil Wells that year....
4623 2018-03-24 20:35:54 That’s false, there have been many economically isolated countries that we haven’t gotten involved in. Now, I believe the Iraq war was about them switching their oil trade to the Euro, as that would directly cause major problems for the US, which is sick and unjust to base a war
4624 2018-03-24 20:35:53 I smell like oil and gas for some odd reason i love that smell after working on a car
4625 2018-03-24 20:35:40 When i get the prescription back bsawerlek yeha. It is temporarily with my friend so he can get me the other medication. It is basically a soap to clean your face, then an oil to close the pore and i am also taking pills for the zits.

4627 2018-03-24 20:35:23 If we taxed oil production in the same way as the Norwegians then we’d wipe out Scotland’s so called ‘deficit’. And you don’t need an oil price of $110 a barrel to do it.

4629 2018-03-24 20:35:05 I’m not impressed by TY Danjuma’s call to arms. He’s a beneficiary of a failed Nigeria so he should enjoy his oil block in silence and quit the lecturing. He didn’t speak when it was Benue. Taraba is affected and he’s found his voice.
4630 2018-03-24 20:35:04 Water or liquid aloe Vera gel, leave in conditioner, organic Shea butter, then castor oil (starting from the scalp to the tips)
4631 2018-03-24 20:35:04 And how many children have been exposed to “gun” violence or flat out killed in country’s where we partake in proxy oil wars or regime change??? Where’s the outrage for them??? Anywhere but US politics and main stream media!
4632 2018-03-24 20:34:58 Can't wait till the youth win and the Dems. Maybe as punishment they can build some oil rigs 50 yards or less away from his club in Florida. It would be fair considering he is trying that on states himself. Impeach 45.

4636 2018-03-24 20:34:12 You know that Swanee Hunt had her oil money in there. Not to mention all the oil money she’s spent last decade funding raids, funding lobbying, funding & supporting the creation of nonprofits we know as the #rescueindustry im certain she is very proud of herself & her supremacy

4639 2018-03-24 20:33:58 Well to be fair Albertas electric bill is just more expensive by a few dollars but still 
Anyway you know how you Albertans celebate being given control of your resources from the Feds in 1930? Well the Feds still control BCs offshore resources and won't allow any offshore oil
4640 2018-03-24 20:33:41 Please if he’s having seizures look into cannabis oil. Phoenix Tears.

4648 2018-03-24 20:32:10 I'd honestly do with oil and gas in BC what WAC Bennett did with electricity. Even though the NDP and liberals screwed with BC Hydro and people complain about hydro bills we still have one of the cheapest electric prices in North America just compare it to Ontario or even Alberta

4653 2018-03-24 20:31:03 acquiescing to increased oil demand is a choice that contributes to destroying the planet. we have the option to resist expanded oil extraction, we aren't servants to it

4662 2018-03-24 20:29:21 There has to be a willingness to build the infrastructure to refine the oil. We send too much oil to the US to be refined and shipped back to us at enormous cost. Pipeline, refineries, shipping overseas, bypass US. Win for everyone.

4669 2018-03-24 20:28:51 Today I did oil change at my regular place @LexusNorthboro dressed in sweat pant, baseball cap and flip flops.Usually the sales people will try to convince me to either trade in my GS 350 or Upgrade but today no one bothered to say hi..don’t judge a book by its cover. SMH
4670 2018-03-24 20:28:15 This is false. Oil is oil & it should be avoided
4671 2018-03-24 20:28:03 ยังไม่หลุดพ้นความรู้สึกนี้...
4672 2018-03-24 20:28:01 Beholden to "oil money"? Economists call it investment. Good grief

4674 2018-03-24 20:27:44 Vaaat cooking oil as body lotion?? Now that's just crazy
4675 2018-03-24 20:27:36 The government finds crude oil on my land and they claim it as theirs, but when they find Indian hemps, they say it's mine.
4676 2018-03-24 20:27:22 I think its because they soak up the oil that they are fried in.
4677 2018-03-24 20:26:56 Exfoliating 1-2x weekly or biweekly is ideal & following up with our absolute must have, Facial Serum, its key ingredients, Black Cumin Seed & Neem oil, are very powerful & potent, in regards to its multiple skin benefits, it brightens & evens the skin out, over time..
4678 2018-03-24 20:26:56 The proposed new #oil field across #Sussex and #Surrey is far from conventional. It's #fracking, sneaking in under the radar. @Prof_Smythe @Haszeldine @alanwhiteheadmp
4679 2018-03-24 20:26:43 Hey there, love - For hyperpigmentation we always recommend starting with our Neem & Lemon essential oil sugar scrub, as the combined ingredients help to remove dead skin cells, gently & effectively without causing any irritation, as well as, brightens & evens the skin out.
4680 2018-03-24 20:26:42 Popping makes it worse. Washing your skin to get the oil off then using lotion to get natural non acne oil back on the skin would be the best solution. If it’s bad you can use stuff that dries it out like proactive.
4681 2018-03-24 20:26:33 tengo una crema que tiene “cannabis oil” y papi viene y me pregunta: “¿ya estás arrebatá?” 
4682 2018-03-24 20:26:21 I agree, this is an attempt to grab the oil in the Middle East, plus overthrow that pesky regime, kill a few undesirable types and make money for the wealthy with a war machine.

4695 2018-03-24 20:23:58 Did I say that? Oh wait, I didn’t, that was you. How about some of the skilled, hard working people that work in the oil industry use their knowledge to work in sustainability energy sectors. Gvt needs to grow these sectors, not pipelines.

4698 2018-03-24 20:23:17 I skipped the rosehip oil to stay on budget. Plus I have some other oils to use in the meanwhile. But I got Buffet, the caffeine stuff, then the aha peel.
4699 2018-03-24 20:22:49 Nigeria cannot survive without Niger Delta oil. Period.
4700 2018-03-24 20:22:46 Distributed solar & batteries are working now! In fact they are reaching cost parity with gas and in some cases cheaper. Soon they will be much cheaper than gas. Additional benefit is no grid loss! Nuke, oil, gas and coal are dying. Power will now be " de-centralized ".

4704 2018-03-24 20:22:31 I think what's been proven so far, and will be reinforced through end of season, is that Oil by & large have right horses in place.  Does coaching finally getting them aligned, confident, translate into keeping Todd?  Hard to dump him if they finish as per recent quality.

4709 2018-03-24 20:22:08 1/2 I’m not going to get into an extended conversation about it. Socialist societies have existed for decades without US involvement. Some of the time we have done shitty things like embargo Cuba, but many of the things you speak on were volatile oil prices not supporting
4710 2018-03-24 20:21:45 Got the oil changed time to fix the sway bar end links next. Baby steps
4711 2018-03-24 20:21:35 Cooler showers, apply one of the lotions others have recommended while your skin is still damp. Hot showers remove too much of the natural oils. If you bathe at night@& wear pajamas you can apply baby oil or even Vaseline to damp skin so it can work overnight.

4720 2018-03-24 20:20:15 Everyone is forgetting though about the fact Vancouvers gas supply all comes from one aging refinery. More oil or not someone needs to build another refinery

4722 2018-03-24 20:19:45 A 16 year old Muslim girl in SA ran away from home because her parents poured hot oil and beat her for refusing marriage to a man she never met in return for $20,000. 

I do not care if this is a culturally acceptable practice in their world, this is NOT okay. This is slavery.
4723 2018-03-24 20:19:26 so today i forgot that eating a freshly cooked takoyaki ball whole is the equivalent of pouring hot oil directly into your mouth
4724 2018-03-24 20:19:20 I use FECO (full extract cannabis oil) to treat myself.  Medical Cannabis saved my life.  Pharmaceutical meds left me near catatonic.
4725 2018-03-24 20:19:16 I was cooking me and my brother some lunch and so far oil has burnt my face and I’ve dropped two eggs on the floor  this is my life rn
4726 2018-03-24 20:19:10 Oil. Coal. Solar. Wind. Hydro. Geothermal. These all exist in an all of the above energy approach. Additionally, all of them combined can give the US powerful leverage in the world particularly in areas that have an energy shortage coupled with economic opportunity.
4727 2018-03-24 20:19:07 No, apparently it is an oil can.
4728 2018-03-24 20:18:56 Difference is Australia is an island but BC has a lot of its own oil
4729 2018-03-24 20:18:46 How does that Catherine McKenna kool-aid taste? Your drinking tons of it......I guess raw sewage is cleaner and safer....perhaps regular Oil is cleaner safer than Oil sands...wow get some education please. Badly needed.
4730 2018-03-24 20:18:43 I make a Fennel and Parm cheese dish that is a HUGE hit with kids. Thinly slice the fennel bulb & red onion, toss with lemon juice & olive oil, toss in a bit of shredded parm cheese. Bake at 400 for 35 minutes. Top with load of parm cheese and brown the top. YUM
4731 2018-03-24 20:18:37 and it means Elohim's Anointed One.....YAHSHUA is the Anointed one sent from Elohim, not the greek christ, which means to annoint something as in cover with oil....no, He is the true Savior and died on the stake for us and not a made up false name. Its a hard saying,

4734 2018-03-24 20:18:05 The protest does nothing for gas prices, but the absence of a pipeline does gave a profound impact on gas prices as it limits supply of both crude oil as well as refined fuels. Less supply = higher prices.
4735 2018-03-24 20:17:50 YHWH definitely! And Like Oil 
4736 2018-03-24 20:17:41 I originally got sight of this thread from a Rich Roll ‘like’...I could agree more with your various tweets though Steve...All these ‘hacks’ are the musings of snake oil salesmen, hard work and eating right are the only ‘shortcuts’ to success.

4759 2018-03-24 20:14:10 Just discovered Lush has a bath oil called Polyamorous that shaped like a big heart with a bunch of small hearts and I’m crying it’s so cute and positive
4760 2018-03-24 20:14:08 Yes we do, and in the meantime ensure production is cleaner and more efficient. That is what the oil sands are doing. KM is being built for the good of Canada to meet an increasing demand, it will not be destroying the planet.

4763 2018-03-24 20:13:29 CA courtcase is an important moment to decide if right strategy was followed by big oil. They knew the wrath of alt-left Marxist marketing power and decided, just like most politicians, not to bet against this development. Weak knees.

4766 2018-03-24 20:13:14 Not that simple sadly. The lower mainland gets most all its gas from one refinery that already processes as much oil as its capable of. You can have more oil there but you can't refine it faster than it is already
4767 2018-03-24 20:12:15 Liberal and logic are like oil and water unfortunately.

4770 2018-03-24 20:11:43 Lol ntn nuh wrong with asking tho. Some people use oils right after washing hair to keep the moisture from the water & some add moisturizer after washing their hair plus the oil

4776 2018-03-24 20:10:06 Sabes donde te podes ir sofia ¿no?
4777 2018-03-24 20:10:05 The problem that overlooked is that the lower mainland gets its gas from just one refinery and it's already refining as much oil as it can. The pipeline won't do crap to lower gas prices because you can't add more oil to a refinery that's already processing as much as it can
4778 2018-03-24 20:10:01 Oh wow, that lip oil is so pretty 
4779 2018-03-24 20:09:54 Iran has oil and local power. It doesn’t kowtow to international pressure exerted by the US and is self-sufficient. This all adds up to enough reason for America to twist world opinion into supporting a war…
4780 2018-03-24 20:09:48 I like the work I do, but it's not what I want to do. I'm gonna start back on my demos and sample works.

4786 2018-03-24 20:08:55 @kura_nc  Can you f’ing believe this? I was joking when I said I was glad we took you there before there are oil rigs in the parks.
4787 2018-03-24 20:08:51 I don't know why ordinary Nigerians take our elites  position on Issues seriously. people that put us in this conundrum? people that shared our oil blocks?TY Danjuma should have told us to fight  n protect our oil blocks.He's silent on this,why?
4788 2018-03-24 20:08:36 No where to walk... Construction everywhere and there out of mites oil.
4789 2018-03-24 20:08:10 I'd say use Argan Oil for a few months. 
4790 2018-03-24 20:08:03 Yes, Waterloo battle....observing in oil painting french military uniform
4791 2018-03-24 20:08:02 The northern interior of BC actually gets its gas from a BC refinery supplied solely by BC oil and not coincidentally they tend to have the lowest gas prices in BC. We just need to expand BCs own oilpatch and get the right to our offshore resources from the Feds for offshore oil
4792 2018-03-24 20:08:00 We love oil the world uses 85 million barrels a day we produce about 90 million a day we need it but the USA doesn’t want Canada trading oil with anyone else and they do everything in their power to block our products to the world #freedom lol

4795 2018-03-24 20:06:51 not offended fjdjk we do have a big variety most of it would be an acquired taste for someone on a standard american diet cause we don't slather oil on everything or deep fry it's mostly meat, veg & starch based, lots of bread too. i find myself missing russian food a lot
4796 2018-03-24 20:06:38 really, reaaaaaaaally blown that out of allllllll the neutrogena products I’ve used, their oil free acne wash is the one that got my face looking like a balloon 
4797 2018-03-24 20:06:20 The KM expansion is for shipping product overseas though the one refinery couldn't refine more than it already does

But if BC were to become independent of Alberta and America for its oil needs we'd have truly a way to have low gas prices
4798 2018-03-24 20:05:50 The oil field in Wyoming and North Dakota is going absolutely nuts right now...stay patient here oil longs!! This stuff is in my backyard...

4802 2018-03-24 20:05:00 @LaurenEMorrill does using oil on your face ACTUALLY help? I was just told this by someone else and I’m skeptical.... I feel like I’m already super oily and shiny although miraculously not broken out....
4803 2018-03-24 20:04:55 Seems apki motorcycle ka petrol koi dalwata ha. He is right the end of zardari tenure got reduce in price because internationally the price of oil were collapsed.

4807 2018-03-24 20:03:47 I decided to change my oil today to save a little money. Not doing that again. Rolling around on the garage floor. Oil all over. I used half a roll of paper towels to clean up.  
4808 2018-03-24 20:03:29 The problem is that pipeline isn't for Vancouver anyway it's for selling oil to China 
BC needs to heavily expand its own oil industry we need more than 1 refinery that supplies gas to the lower mainland
4809 2018-03-24 20:03:18 And you are an oil painting? Lol.
4810 2018-03-24 20:03:17 i need to do about 4 color comic pages minimum and clean my whole house before Steph comes here for our AB trip, and get a eye exam and a haircut, and finish some commissions and put in the orders I took at Aseliacon, and clean my car and get oil changed, and do some templates

4813 2018-03-24 20:02:23 If the government can't protect us , should we wait for Danjuma to sell his oil blocks?
4814 2018-03-24 20:02:22 We need water but why are we paying $1 for half liter of bottled water one of Canada’s greatest natural resources and we pay $1 for a litre of gasoline The USA uses 20 million barrels of oil a day. The world uses 85 million barrels a day

Anyway, I believe the Man already knows they won't renew his OML and he is ready for an all out confrontation.
4822 2018-03-24 20:01:37 He needs more oil. The Dodo is not frying

4840 2018-03-24 19:59:36 I basically said, in a previous post, the oil companies should not be permitted to drill any more wells. They should be forced to make some recompense for the damage their greed has done to the environment.

4848 2018-03-24 19:56:46 So question. If the oil companies we're not up in the oilsands, who would be cleaning it all up? You do realize that the oilsands is natural right? Oil has always leaked out of the ground and into the waterways up there. Oil companies have been cleaning up mother nature's mess.
4849 2018-03-24 19:56:37 UPA achieved close to 8% average growth despite being a coalition govt. that didn't allow it to carry out reforms. Despite oil being at record high prices, which is what India spends most of its money on - importing oil. Despite the economic crisis years.

Thanks

4867 2018-03-24 19:53:49 Was not for the Keystone Pipeline or the connector that's coming. Worried about the bread basket of America. We have to feed the masses. We can live without the oil.
4868 2018-03-24 19:53:20 Ironically, BC's premier @jjhorgan is now complaining about high gas prices....ok snowflake, time to see what a world without oil really looks like. Good luck with that!

4871 2018-03-24 19:52:31 Well how do you use it? Lol i use oil after I moisturize because it *locks* moisture in. I don't use oil by itself to moisturize because the concept doesn't make sense to me lol 
4872 2018-03-24 19:52:31 Was it worth it? Haha. Yeah I'm sure it would work. You wouldn't use yeast mind. Maybe oil and water? Not sure but give it a Google. 

Cauliflower base would work too but wouldnt be tasty imo lol

4895 2018-03-24 19:48:30 OMFG. Are you kidding? 2008-2009 was biggest economic crisis since great depression. Oil was at all-time highs. Oil was at all-time low when Modi took power, yet did petrol prices come down? No, where did that money go? More cess and more taxes = still no growth?

4940 2018-03-24 19:43:21 You talking about that African oil in the white and green bottle ?
4941 2018-03-24 19:43:07 Dude, get real, he’s never played at 4.3 speed in his life. He only ran go routes at WVU, he’s slow playing in camp and on Sunday’s. You’re trying to sell snake oil
4942 2018-03-24 19:42:55 What are u doing with olive oil??
4943 2018-03-24 19:42:33 Drove to the car dealer for my SCHEDULED oil change, only to find out they didn’t actually put me on the schedule ... sure am glad they had a cancellation, otherwise they would have seen the Yankee come out in me!  #dontwastemytime #imonlyherebecauseitsfree
4944 2018-03-24 19:42:30 Johnny Manziel talk all this equality shit but i bet he wont talk about his Arab grandparents stealing black church folks land and oil rights at the barrel of a gun.
4945 2018-03-24 19:42:24 Bella Curls leave in conditioner

A moisturizing oil. I can't remember the name but it's from Walmart and in a spray bottle

Then Black castor and Flaxseed Eco Style gel to twist
4946 2018-03-24 19:42:22 It became an explicit part of Russia energy policy in 2000s - leading to an extraordinary range of gas prices across its European customers. (Gas is easier to turn off and on than oil).
4947 2018-03-24 19:42:13 It saddens me some people will never know how supreme quality olive oil is infinitely better than that plain stuff you get at Walmart
4948 2018-03-24 19:42:04 最早このセリフしかおぼえてないｗ
4949 2018-03-24 19:42:01 I had a dream I threw caution to the wind and traded my car in for a bmw truck. Woke up scared as hell. Those oil changes are mad expensive. I legit looked out the window to make sure I still had my damn Altima
4950 2018-03-24 19:41:54 adds flavor. i use coconut or olive oil to cook but i know thats why other people use it :/
4951 2018-03-24 19:41:52 If a slap you, wait for danjuma to sell his oil bloc before you retaliate.
This is a retarded tweet by you.
4952 2018-03-24 19:41:45 Just splashed hot oil on my skin becos I'm frying. 
4953 2018-03-24 19:41:42 "I hate people" but yet still you can't do without em
4954 2018-03-24 19:41:31 Bless grape seed oil 
4955 2018-03-24 19:41:24 Ngl that oil meme is kind of fucked up in how it trivializes America’s brand of violent imperialism in the last 20 years and plays it for laughs

4957 2018-03-24 19:41:11 Getting my oil changed ..let’s see what bullshit they will say I should fix.
4958 2018-03-24 19:41:11 ...which is that global CB's stopped lending to US in 3q14 and so US has been scrambling to fund itself in global private markets ever since, driving LIBOR higher.  EM's don't need USD reserves if they can print domestic currency for imports like oil, which is how CNY oil ties in
4959 2018-03-24 19:40:59 The food chain in America is corrupted. Eat organic and non GMO for a week. Stay away from fried foods for awhile as well . Buy some organic unrefined coconut oil and eat a little each day. You can put it in coffee or tea or whatever . Mix with Braggs apple cider vinegar later on
4960 2018-03-24 19:40:53 Got an oil change waited 2 and half hours, got McDonald’s waited 15 mins got tires it’s been two hours and I’m still fucking waiting
4961 2018-03-24 19:40:34 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
4962 2018-03-24 19:40:31 I can’t remember if she’s done it already but has @nailogical tried to just mix liquid highlighter with holo instead of using weird things like oil
4963 2018-03-24 19:40:27 Did the oil in his hair wash out? Is located in the Middle East? I think we should invade it.
4964 2018-03-24 19:40:16 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
4965 2018-03-24 19:40:10 Under Klein oil prices were low and he grew the economy GDP and jobs by 164,000. The only jobs Notkey added were in the public sector.
4966 2018-03-24 19:40:01 the answer to all problems in life is coconut oil
4967 2018-03-24 19:39:50 Drew: “hold him to a 19 point crib and then down he goes burning in a vat of hot oil”

Jeff: “yeah well I’m gonna put you on a stretcher and two tug boats are gonna pull you apart” 

They are playing CRIBBAGE
4968 2018-03-24 19:39:20 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
4969 2018-03-24 19:39:18 Try that oil stuff they always posting about????? Tarte I THINK I'm not sure but that is the best stuff to use when using cream contour or mixing with the foundation when blending
4970 2018-03-24 19:39:07 As I cleaned the @ventahood_co today with @DawnDish, I felt relief that same soap was used to clean up oil spills on marine life... because my kitchen was the scene of an oil spill.
4971 2018-03-24 19:38:56 Didn’t realize I gave the oil change place my AIM email years back. Just got made fun of for that.
4972 2018-03-24 19:38:47 maybe if I pour lemon water, coconut oil, and vera aloe all over my life everything will be fixed
4973 2018-03-24 19:38:40 Me tendria que estar cambiando peroooooo se que vas a llegar tipo 18:00 @Sofu_universe
4974 2018-03-24 19:38:02 I see that Halo works well on people with dry skin, but what about us oily girls? My skin is literally an oil slick. So wack lol
4975 2018-03-24 19:37:59 Essential oil blend for energy, focus and mood enhancement 
2 drops lemongrass
3 drops peppermint
3 drops rosemary
2 drops juniper berry
2 drops violet

I'm diggin' it! :D
4976 2018-03-24 19:37:58 Under @RachelNotley oil prices have always been low. Does that constitute a cycle of oil prices?

4980 2018-03-24 19:37:25 I know you all want tron to hit $1. Listen carefully, whale groups and pro traders will test the strength of your grip on your coins, they’ll put water on it, oil, tug at it. Do not sell your TRX for less than it’s worth. (I don’t hold TRX btw)
4981 2018-03-24 19:37:21 How many single issue voters will side with dems just because?
4982 2018-03-24 19:37:16 The act of anointing with sacred oil emphasized that it was God himselfwho had ordained a person and given him authority to act as his representative.

4985 2018-03-24 19:36:28 just used peppermint oil with my shampoo and i can feel every hair follicle growing from my scalp help
4986 2018-03-24 19:36:27 Of course, this could be little eventful though it could be a huge chaos if it is not managed in a timely manner. All you need is one of the main oil producers ( Russia or Iran) decides to only sell their oil in yuan, that will be something unimaginable taking place.
4987 2018-03-24 19:36:12 They sometimes forget that Bush launched us into an Orwellian forever war over oil
4988 2018-03-24 19:36:06 Uuu girl my tzone has enough oil to fry spam, I could use something to control it 
4989 2018-03-24 19:35:57 71, that was a good year. Pre oil embargo.
4990 2018-03-24 19:35:35 Car passed its MOT today. Had to get CV clamp and rubber thingie replaced though. Plus 2 new tyres 2 weeks ago, brake discs and pads 1 week ago, and throw in wiper blades and a oil tip up for good measure last week. Bloody skint now.
4991 2018-03-24 19:35:28 Moffle s Candy House Moffle being the main entrance, and she licks the oil in after we've come this far, intruder!
4992 2018-03-24 19:35:28 show me facts on neuroblastoma  using oil, with a gen mutation. please so I can tell my dr. to get it
4993 2018-03-24 19:34:47 Nice try. The pipeline didn't just spontaneously "burst". The city of Burnaby hit it with an excavator.  You can't seriously believe the houses in Burnaby use backyard water wells?No drinking water was contaminated. 90% of the oil recovered. 100% cleanup. 0 deaths or injuries.
4994 2018-03-24 19:34:28 Lol
4995 2018-03-24 19:34:24 Dinosaurs Thrived for 150million years,  in a 1600-4000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 350ppm. Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice. We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
4996 2018-03-24 19:34:20 But what does that mean?To be anointed, literally, is to have sacred oil poured on one’s head, because God has chosen the person for a special task. Priests and kings were anointed, and occasionally prophets.
4997 2018-03-24 19:33:58 I could have helped you! I know where you can get Black Castor oil...There is a company called Mizizi/ Sheth Naturals. I use it in my oil blend and it works.
4998 2018-03-24 19:33:40 "Uh.. better. I bandaged it up to stop the oil from seeping out. I'll actually get to repairing it tomorrow.."
4999 2018-03-24 19:33:39 I thought, “I’ll look at Twitter cos I’m bored while getting my oil changed.” Huge mistake...too much political posts today! Ugh  
5000 2018-03-24 19:33:33 These ppl are motivated, facts don't matter.
If Republicans want to maintain control they better pull a giant rabbit out of the hat QUICK!
5001 2018-03-24 19:33:14 ADD to the list:  UK Labour slapped a TOP SECRET on McCrone Report to steal oil
5002 2018-03-24 19:33:10 Oblivion, Get home, Winter of our youth, Oil on water, Remains and The anchor are my favorite songs by Bastille and I listen to them in an unhealthy way every day so ... I spend all my days crying.

5006 2018-03-24 19:32:38 For example, smells are one of my worst triggers. I have to carry essential peppermint oil in my purse to put on my neck and wrists when a scent hits that hurts. The peppermint blocks the smell. 2/
5007 2018-03-24 19:32:35 In MERICA, Cheese tends to just be bread + tomato sauce + cheese. "Margarita" implies some greater level of finesse even if it's just someone sprinkling a bit of basil and/or Olive Oil on it
5008 2018-03-24 19:32:29 Sorry, it is a difficult issue because Alberta’s oil industry does provided a lot of good jobs, but there is little benefit for BC. They have more to lose from it, than they gain. So, I take issue when they say it is in the “National Interest”
5009 2018-03-24 19:32:18 While you gladly pay NRA/Pharma/Oil/Energy/Coal/Bank/etc., bought and paid for stooges 175-300k a year for less than 200 hours a year's work. Go research that.
5010 2018-03-24 19:32:17 Hopefully this face mask or this oil will get this dry skin OFF my face 
5011 2018-03-24 19:32:12 Why do these keyboard princesses think they can win the battle with an Ex Oil wizard.. this is funny.
5012 2018-03-24 19:32:03 Oh yeah? Cui Bono? Look at who is "winning" from a Trump Presidency: Lockheed Martin & the Defense Industry & the Saudis (who he just sold a bunch of weapons to) & people who want war w/Iran & notoriously Deep State Oil Companies & Wall St bankers. You've been hoodwinked!
5013 2018-03-24 19:31:37 Wow Luke. Now you’re really stretching. LIBOR increase is multi-variable, but tax reform is the primary driver, not a CNY oil contract
5014 2018-03-24 19:31:26 "You guys?" The whole conversation I had was of how fossil fuels (oil and gas ) are required for extracting and producing alternate energy products.
5015 2018-03-24 19:31:24 I joked with Willow that the rolling oaks oil guy left to go to North Star. Here I am at North Star, witnessing my prediction come true

5025 2018-03-24 19:29:37 Second product High EPA Fish oil pricey but worth every penny read about it it’s awesome take 1-10mg per day 10mg only after easing into the product so your stomach gets time to become comfortable with it hope you give this a try it should have solid results if taken daily
5026 2018-03-24 19:29:36 Baby oil? When I did pageants the damn adhesive spray would stay on my skin for so long.
5027 2018-03-24 19:29:30 No straws generally. The amount of oil that has to be drilled to produce the plastic for a single use item. What a waste
5028 2018-03-24 19:28:52 Hypocrites. If you don’t like it just try living without oil and oil products for a while.

5034 2018-03-24 19:27:33 Fatih Birol (IEA): "Iedereen maakt zich er zorgen over dat oliebedrijven niet goed zijn voorbereid op peak oil. Misschien moeten we ook eens nadenken over het tegenovergestelde: dat we niet goed zijn voorbereid op de krappere oliemarkten voorafgaand aan peak oil.”

There is absolutely a problem with opioid addicts that should be addressed, but not at the cost of those who need& use it responsibly. There should also be viable & legal  alternatives,  like marijuana or cbd oil.

5046 2018-03-24 19:25:04 today in 1989: The Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Gulf of Alaska (Prince William Sound), spilling 11-million gallons of crude oil in the largest oil tanker spill in U.S. history.
5047 2018-03-24 19:24:47 Some fast food literally smells like shit and Hot oil. I dunno how some of u are so ready to consume that everyday 
5048 2018-03-24 19:24:44 Got it. It might be that they say the backup is oil because they have the biggest oil reserve. Even when the oil is no renewable, Venezuelan revenues are in goold. I think whatever back up is always in ‘futures’: gold is still a promise cuz it can be stolen or sold.
5049 2018-03-24 19:24:33 No wonder Nnamdi Kanu was able to use you people to make his money. Illiteracy is a disease. Where is the crude oil in the east? All your target is my place, and failure is your name

5052 2018-03-24 19:23:53 I fail to understand the difference in a closed league and a pro/rel league with no cap where an oil sheik can buy a team and spend unlimited money. Is that “sporting merit” or just someone who can buy the best players in the world?
5053 2018-03-24 19:23:43 @POTUS ; @uscongress00 : You say that the economy is good. What planet are you on? For all of us on S.S. Prices are going up on everything, Gasoline, Heating oil, food, Town taxes, State Taxes, etc.. The tax bill that you passed didn't put a dime in our pocket.

5071 2018-03-24 19:20:51 Until then are you going to push your car? The infrastructure needs complete upgrading before that can happen. Oil demand will not peak until 2030 and will be many years before oil is eliminated, if ever.

Mike's prediction is the same will happen to #oil in the mid-2020s because cars are becoming electric, and half of oil is used by transportation
5076 2018-03-24 19:19:47 @ayeshacurry I am saddened to hear of Steph's knee injury.  If you don't mind my advice, I am offering it.  Give him some Black Seed Oil.  I say this because both my knees were hurting for over six months, I took 1/2 tsp of the oil. I could walk/even run with my class/NO PAIN!!!!
5077 2018-03-24 19:19:32 Con Senator Richard Neufeld is spokesperson for oil industry, imo. Just another fossil fool.
5078 2018-03-24 19:19:19 Rubbing down w tea tree oil mixed w green alcohol right out the shower is a blessed feeling 
5079 2018-03-24 19:19:14 Canadians oil is cheap they will buy refine and sell
5080 2018-03-24 19:18:51 Baby oil works wonders on stainless steel  deep cleaning on a Saturday is so fun to me low key 
5081 2018-03-24 19:18:45 Na just a regular oil change
5082 2018-03-24 19:18:05 More like a well-oiled oil splat.
5083 2018-03-24 19:18:02 I’ve been at the dealership for an oil change for ten years I’m getting antsy alreadyyy
5084 2018-03-24 19:17:55 Why Does Bio Oil Take So Long To Soak In? #PregnancyProblems #IKnowItsBecauseItsAnOil #ItsJustInconvenient
5085 2018-03-24 19:17:53 How long do it take to change oil n brakes fuck I been here since 9
5086 2018-03-24 19:17:48 Awww what bad luck! Bite dad and demand them lol. I understand the no mushrooms and onions etc thing. Is it ok if I whisk the eggs, put a little canola oil in a pan and cook it like that?
5087 2018-03-24 19:17:41 Oil them bad boys up press them feet together and have a day

5091 2018-03-24 19:17:14 I 100% respect our military but I don’t think a lot people understand that all they are, are foot soldiers in the gang called america. They are in the Middle East fighting for oil but in reality is it a bad thing or a good thing
5092 2018-03-24 19:16:58 Nadie está hablado de que el lunes arrancan los futuros de oil en yuanes, no vendrá por ahí la mano?
5093 2018-03-24 19:16:57 and it was a problem that was non-existent. Monopolies never had existed, people will use Standard Oil as an example of a monopoly, when in reality, it had lost 30% of its shares leading up to the 1911 break up.
5094 2018-03-24 19:16:52 I fried samosas with coconut oil and it’s so nice.
5095 2018-03-24 19:16:45 Ok fish oil makes my hair grow more than biotin does
5096 2018-03-24 19:16:44 I tried oil and it took most of the smell of but I’ll try that rn! Thanks lol

5100 2018-03-24 19:16:22 On a long enough time line the human race will end. Eg when oil / gas runs out expect wars. The sun will explode in 4bn years anyway. We’re doomed!

5102 2018-03-24 19:16:19 Did you the oil and gas sector is only 18% of Alberta’s economy. Who needs to diversify.
5103 2018-03-24 19:16:16 Changed my oil when I didn't want to, yay for me.
5104 2018-03-24 19:16:16 Jesus u doing an oil change too
5105 2018-03-24 19:16:10 Two words.....coconut oil.
5106 2018-03-24 19:16:06 #webbothits OR clif_high ON MARCH 26- Here’s how it will work…
   The Shanghai International Energy Exchange is introducing a crude oil  futures contract denominated in Chinese yuan. It will allow oil  producers to sell their oil for yuan.  China knows most oil producers don’t
5107 2018-03-24 19:15:37 What u wanted too change like ur motor oil ? Like how they do it when u get a Lil change

5110 2018-03-24 19:15:30 @Austin_DP83 How is the weather up in the oil fields today?
5111 2018-03-24 19:15:15 @Kia is the worst decision I’ve made. From the dealerships all the way to @KiaConsumerCare, delays a fake promises every step. Wrong trailer hitch, promised an unlimited 3yr maint plan but has 5 oil changes and no tire rotation. Stay away from Kia! Looking at a GMC now...
5112 2018-03-24 19:15:13 Had to share  

You know you’re in the south when you’re sitting in the dealership waiting room getting an oil change and a customer comes in and tells the salesman “I brought that 12 gauge...It’s in your office” 
5113 2018-03-24 19:15:02 In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together.
5114 2018-03-24 19:14:24 There's divinity to be played. Lay some oil slicks over your enemies then light them all on fire
5115 2018-03-24 19:14:14 I would much rather buy less expensive oil from AB,helping Canada's economy,rather than pay more for shipping it up the coast from the US. Opposing the pipeline is ridiculous. Yet people complain about affordability in BC. #bcpoli
5116 2018-03-24 19:14:02 Actually, I think you and Stone are agents of the Deep State. That would explain Trump’s sycophantic embrace of the Military-Industrial Complex, of Wall St, of Big Oil and of the Saudis. You guys helped elect a Deep State All-Star! You are a Deep State psy-op.

5120 2018-03-24 19:13:13 Hate waiting to get my oil change
5121 2018-03-24 19:13:07 i love these silly united states oil memes
5122 2018-03-24 19:13:03 How is it 2018 and people still think armed conflict is about anything but water or oil. Where you see Muslims vs. Christians, or sects within one faith killing each other, I see people who were neighbors before nation-states, before colonization, before fossil fuels.
5123 2018-03-24 19:13:02 i am so happy i have found many artistic creative outlets to express myself through & i am about to invest in an acoustic, bass guitar, piano & electric harp along with more canvases, leather paint, acrylic, water color & oil paint..sewing clothes, FUCK.

5125 2018-03-24 19:13:00 No matter how annoyed I am that I need to sit through this oil change, I'm eternally happy that Tim scheduled this appt for me and forced me to go so my car doesn't eat itself.
5126 2018-03-24 19:12:41 Nobody that I know that is an environmentalist is getting paid by anyone.  They are teachers, nurses, moms with small children, students, seniors, vegetable growers, everyday people.  The " getting paid" story is one invented in the oil patch. #gmg4c

5131 2018-03-24 19:12:00 How badly are Canadians getting screwed by big oil and the unfair price fixing and collusion in BC? I know a guy who put $200 of gas in a Ford truck! #dang - this in an oil rich country! #amazing PS, with every hike in price the Govt gets even more in tax revenue!

What is beautiful about ours is the reclamation! If we can extract, then clean to such high standards, what’s wrong?

5145 2018-03-24 19:10:09 I believe that by the mid 2020s, we will see a decrease in oil consumption because #electriccars will become so common. In that vein, I think that #climatechange will prompt new technology that we can't imagine now and it will be commonplace. #Investors must be prepared.
5146 2018-03-24 19:10:08 An oil change turned into front brakes and new brake fluids

5150 2018-03-24 19:09:28 Do you think it’s going to be such a big beautiful pipeline that the oil will just jump in there all by itself?
5151 2018-03-24 19:09:23 I apply shea butter on it daily, does the trick.

5158 2018-03-24 19:08:34 It doesn't matter how pipeline protesters heat their homes. Homes can be heated without #KinderMorgan If we invest those billions in renewables maybe we can heat our homes without oil. We have to forget about profits for a min. & try not to destroy the planet. #TransMountain
5159 2018-03-24 19:08:33 Can't really understand why you're pedaling snake oil to us commoners on Twitter, isn't there better uses for your time? Your corporations image is irreparably screwed now, so whats the point of these posts? Collecting more data on whos paying attention to you?
5160 2018-03-24 19:08:28 So , I need to know how to change my own damn oil .. cause I’m tired of waking up early & having to wait 1 hour +
5161 2018-03-24 19:08:24 There are carbon free energy sources available.

There is no need to expand fossil fuels infrastructure now. We can't if we r to tackle Global Warming.

The're lots of jobs in the transition to renewables. It's a small number of oil investors who want to prevent this for profit.
5162 2018-03-24 19:08:23 I love the upsells at Oil Change joints. Please, just change the oil.
5163 2018-03-24 19:08:16 I used this oil in my hair called “minding my business” super oil and let  me tell youuuuuu! Best thing I’ve used! Swear by it! I think it’s available everywhere!

5195 2018-03-24 19:04:06 As intrigued by the Fusion Energi as I am, my wife pointed out that still having a gas engine/transmission means still needing the occasional oil change and transmission service. A pure EV does seem like it would save on maintenance costs, long term. #StillThinking

5199 2018-03-24 19:03:58 Does anyone else think it's odd we are still fighting wars over oil. And if it is such a precious commodity, why the fuck are we letting every jackass with a car use it.

5220 2018-03-24 19:00:52 Not had that one, but had the Neck Oil in Manchester a few weeks ago. Very, very nice.
5221 2018-03-24 19:00:44 I always check products for palm oil before buying them. People are still unaware of the suffering caused and the word needs to be spread far and wide....peanut butter being one of the main culprits!
5222 2018-03-24 19:00:43 This made me actually laugh out loud. Lol.
5223 2018-03-24 19:00:40 I’m tryna learn how to do my own oil change cause that shits expensive
5224 2018-03-24 19:00:22 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
5225 2018-03-24 19:00:19 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5226 2018-03-24 19:00:06 Shatterday is here with 10% off Oil & Carts! Why not top off your dabs with a little THC-A @ 15% off all day!! Open every day until 8pm
5227 2018-03-24 19:00:01 This story tells us that Big Oil is passing the buck to governments. 

How does that work?

Well, your honour, its their fault for allowing us to lobby and corrupt them!

Perhaps they have a point.

5228 2018-03-24 19:00:00 Can you make it with less oil
5229 2018-03-24 18:59:38 This made my day   L. O. L.
5230 2018-03-24 18:59:29 わたしがお空を始めた理由は今ならベリアルの指定語句をフルボイスで誰でも聴けるって聞いたからです
5231 2018-03-24 18:59:25 Do any of you good folks know about, use, or even make quality beard oil? Let a brother know.
5232 2018-03-24 18:59:17 This isn't right.  They can not just take Syria's oil.
5233 2018-03-24 18:59:13 We live in a country that elected @realDonaldTrump president. 

In related news did you know that @RealAlexJones sells the same snake oil as @GwynethPaltrow on @goop.
5234 2018-03-24 18:59:10 "US will be the largest stealer of oil"  seems more like it
5235 2018-03-24 18:58:35 When your oil change and tire rotation is free>>
5236 2018-03-24 18:58:01 Oh Sorry, I forgot it's anointing Oil that is in front of you.
5237 2018-03-24 18:58:00 Just got a dark roast coffee w coconut oil and butter in it. I think my life has been forever changed
5238 2018-03-24 18:57:33 When did Norway leave the EU? And let's not forget Norway's circumstances, a vastly greater GNP per capita, and huge oil reserves and a £1.1tn oil fund. Look, I am a socialist as well...this is an argument I don't want to have, we should all be on the same side here
5239 2018-03-24 18:57:23 Junkrat looks like he drank engine oil
5240 2018-03-24 18:57:18 @BrookTremaine use coconut oil!
5241 2018-03-24 18:57:06 Hahaha, oil is used by everyone, even you. Hypocrite.
5242 2018-03-24 18:56:50 For anyone who doesn’t know, sesame oil is the shit.
5243 2018-03-24 18:56:47 why does this oil change feel so personal
5244 2018-03-24 18:56:30 Will there be a march against terrosits or will the focus be on oil companies or tire manufacturers or windshield wiper manufacturer?
5245 2018-03-24 18:56:29 pake bio oil
5246 2018-03-24 18:56:28 Norway, because of its massive supply of oil and wise investing of the profits from it.
5247 2018-03-24 18:56:17 Should'nt that be "energy is life"...without energy (mostly provided by oil) you'd be living in a cave
5248 2018-03-24 18:56:05 Coconut oil!
5249 2018-03-24 18:56:04 I’m tryina figure out why my oil change so expensive 
5250 2018-03-24 18:56:02 The people, people all across Canada are finding out the dirty little secret to this, that it’s not just about a pipeline to B.C., it’s about oil tankers out of Westridge and oil spills in B.C. and Canada’s most precious resource...the west coast. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli
5251 2018-03-24 18:55:47 Si Cristobal HDP Lopez le debe tanta guita al Estado, (todos Nosotros) quiere decir que Nosotros podemos pasar por las estaciones OIL y cargar combustible para descontar deuda, no ???
5252 2018-03-24 18:55:42 "Oil? What oil...?"  lol
5253 2018-03-24 18:55:37 The safest way to consume high quality olive oil is to eat nothing but steak.
5254 2018-03-24 18:55:32 キャラ自体ももちろん大好きなんだけど普通にビジュアルが好み
5255 2018-03-24 18:55:18 I’m getting a bunch of maintanence done on my Jeep today that’s more than just an oil change & I feel like such an adult I hate it where can I opt out
5256 2018-03-24 18:55:09 Yes but Trump is soft on Russia, the mass sanction he put against Russia, the huge lift he gave to the United States oil industry and now this, still not good enough for the liberal media they'd rather see a nuclear war
5257 2018-03-24 18:55:06 サンダルフォンくんのキャラデザ普通に好みなんだよなぁ
5258 2018-03-24 18:55:02 I found success in a multi step process. Like ... an “essence” base layer (like a jelly formula, not unlike a toner), then a soothing oil, then a moisturizer AND THEN (if wearing makeup) a moisturizing primer 
5259 2018-03-24 18:54:55 Oil changed. Might as well get breaks and rotors too.
5260 2018-03-24 18:54:42 Roast broccoli with olive oil and garlic.  Yum.
5261 2018-03-24 18:54:35 @larry_kudlow why has oil and gold risen? Because the dollar has fallen, you should know that Larry. The question should be, why is the dollar being sold? Perhaps to answer this you should look at who is selling UST's.
5262 2018-03-24 18:53:50 The sooner a barrel of oil is $500, the sooner people will start to value it...
5263 2018-03-24 18:53:23 Schlumberger أكبر شركة في العالم في مجال الOil service
5264 2018-03-24 18:53:13 im gonna search up tweets with the word oil in it and start sending pics of the army to it
5265 2018-03-24 18:53:09 Tiny drop of olive oil, tiny tiny!! Tilt head to one side for a few seconds until it doesn’t dribble out! X

5268 2018-03-24 18:52:08 ethical oil is a misnomer. oil production is not ethical, and canada's contrasting of its own unethical acts against worse ones from other nations as a way to justify our lesser evils is a cheap tactic we use to avoid holding ourselves accountable
5269 2018-03-24 18:51:57 Oil senators!!  How low can they go, waiting for a session with lot of them not attending
5270 2018-03-24 18:51:56 Energy101!
Where Does Energy Come From?

Coal Source

5271 2018-03-24 18:51:50 Getting a inspection & oil change and the guy goes I got dibs on the silver bullet lmfao

5274 2018-03-24 18:51:36 I hate getting oil changes.
5275 2018-03-24 18:51:29 No it isn't. It's the US oil industry setting US policy.
5276 2018-03-24 18:51:23 @CelliniNick  hates Wesson Oil ... confirmed 
5277 2018-03-24 18:51:20 The Republicans and Betsy DeVos don't want you to grow up to be smart. They need cannon fodder for their future Wars. And a smart educated American cannot be convince to fight in unlawful Wars for oil and ego!. the Trump model
5278 2018-03-24 18:51:18 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む
他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
5279 2018-03-24 18:51:12 Yup it would prove Horgan’s hypocrisy & stupidity. Getting Oil from foreign sources that don’t follow Enviro regulations not only increases traffic but increases risk. Of course that is what the activists want. Fools!
5280 2018-03-24 18:51:09 OMG. That's totally why they give you castor oil to barf! The ricin. Love it when dots connect in my brain!
5281 2018-03-24 18:51:08 There oughta be laws against these 'snake oil' exploitive seminars...  And shame for so called 'credible' speakers participating!.  
5282 2018-03-24 18:50:46 夕飯食い損ねたからクソ腹減ってる
5283 2018-03-24 18:50:45 So what. It's too cold anyway requiring oil to heat homes. Everything will work out
5284 2018-03-24 18:50:44 Does that include peanut oil?
5285 2018-03-24 18:50:31 "US WILL BE LARGEST OIL PRODUCER BY 2023." - @WSJ

As if that wasn't the point. As if it wasn't the point to drain every reserve but that of the country whose currency is tied by fiat to oil trade. As if it wasn't designed to prolong the life of the dollar before default.
5286 2018-03-24 18:50:30 Methinks he is too enamored of himself. He's a snake oil salesman.
5287 2018-03-24 18:50:25 Buy a car and pay thousands of dollars a year to car companies, finance and insurance companies, oil companies—be a “rebel”! [literally every car commercial]
5288 2018-03-24 18:50:24 Willpower, mascara and coconut oil. I believe in you.
5289 2018-03-24 18:50:23 We have two senior Chihuahuas that are FAMILY. One has an enlarged heart.

Chico finds immediate comfort, less panicking and less labored breathing with a small amount of cannibis oil we have for human use ie. cooking from Canopy. 

Gives him a little break in a small 1-2ml doses
5290 2018-03-24 18:50:22 Hmu kush bars oil yay
5291 2018-03-24 18:50:16 Oil & Gas Exploration is no longer necessary as we turn away from behaviours that will kill your Grandchildren.
5292 2018-03-24 18:49:54 Lucas Oil Racing tv..
5293 2018-03-24 18:49:50 Your sign literally says "10 minute oil change". Not "1 hour oil change because were going to check everything since you've never been with us before."
5294 2018-03-24 18:49:45 ちんこにしか見えない
5295 2018-03-24 18:49:40 Make some bread dough, but leave out a little of the water and half the flour. Let it bubble. Slow-roast a head of garlic.
Blitz the garlic with the left-out water, parsley stalks, olive oil, pepper & nutmeg. Add it to the dough mix with the remaining flour and chopped parsley.
5296 2018-03-24 18:49:12 Yum yum and more yum and they were all over the audience at the end. But winning the chance to rub baby oil on one was a def highlight because I got to run my hands all over his chest and back and arms.

5300 2018-03-24 18:48:24 "Stop the paid protestors from landlocking our oil" Good Point. Stop the oil from destroying our health" Another Good Point. #waterislife
5301 2018-03-24 18:48:19 All of this. RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) or Phoenix Tears is a wonderful treatment and can be ingested via edibles or just dissolve under tongue so there's no smoking. Went through this w/mom & best friend. I'm very familiar cannabis/cancer if you have ?'s. Wishing you the best 
5302 2018-03-24 18:48:07 Its not that kind of psycho joor
5303 2018-03-24 18:47:53 Had a little look, fingers crossed Mr Steve will sort it

5306 2018-03-24 18:47:29 you dream of standing in the midst of a blizzard. you are naked but your blood is hot, you bleed oil. your eyes leak tar and your fingernails fall off. you dirty the pure landscape with your need to consume. you wake up wanting. you want. you don't know what you want.
5307 2018-03-24 18:47:23 Just watched some lady at the gas station dump like 3 quarts of oil in her car she was either dangerously low or has no idea what she’s doing lol
5308 2018-03-24 18:47:16 Man that oil money though. I'm sure vkm is falling out a chair thinking about that
5309 2018-03-24 18:47:15 I feel such a great sense of accomplishment whenever I get my oil changed
5310 2018-03-24 18:47:02 SAVE IT!!!!! HE DOESN’T DESERVE THAT
PUT SOME OIL ON IT BUT MAKE SURE YOU DON’T DROWN HIM :((((
5311 2018-03-24 18:46:58 Oh no! I've sprung an oil leak! Easter getaway in doubt!
5312 2018-03-24 18:46:36 Damn too much of oil
5313 2018-03-24 18:46:26 this green tea tree oil mask makes me look like the first born of shrek
5314 2018-03-24 18:46:24 From CA reducing felonies to misdemeanors, releasing criminal illegals, or the lax sentencing of violent offenders. Just silence

5316 2018-03-24 18:45:54 Almost 40 minutes now for a 10 minute oil change. Fucking hell.

5319 2018-03-24 18:45:22 In 1944, VP Henry Wallace was ousted by Party bosses in what was referred to as ‘Pauley’s coup’.

Dem Party Treasurer & oil millionaire Edwin Pauley had once quipped that he went into politics because it was cheaper to elect a new Congress than to buy up the old one.

Familiar???

5324 2018-03-24 18:45:01 It's not just oil companies. It's also government and taxation. Vancouver's price also includes a carbon tax.
5325 2018-03-24 18:44:58 Spray the cupcake cups with oil first
5326 2018-03-24 18:44:51 Yeah hopefully. I kept putting the shit off and I looked up yesterday and realized I've already been fucking up so I gotta get it done. Might change this oil here in the whip today. Gotta do that by tomorrow too
5327 2018-03-24 18:44:39 Perhaps she is talking about the oil memes going around
5328 2018-03-24 18:44:38 kat mana jual virgin coconut oil ni ?
5329 2018-03-24 18:44:38 what if geezer has a crippling fear of oil
5330 2018-03-24 18:44:26 LRT: i worry about this a lot re: my gouache paintings actually! i recently realized that the kind of paper i prefer most (arches oil paper) also fades to a really strange peachy color if you leave it in the sun for a long time. >:I

5332 2018-03-24 18:44:10 How did she get to the site?.. Did she ride her bicycle?, skateboard? or walk from his home/office in the morning. Seriously , how did she get on the site?.. Was it a OIL power vehicle?. Can someone confirm this?

5334 2018-03-24 18:43:33 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
5335 2018-03-24 18:43:33 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5337 2018-03-24 18:43:23 Well for the record...Trump had just left S.Korea and China was pressured by Trump. He called them out then busted them for smuggling oil to N.Korea after the sanctions. Then China came to the real table and put the hammer on N. Korea. That was 100% Trump! #ArtOfTheDeal

5341 2018-03-24 18:42:26 You're making assumptions mate. Like I told someone else, you should take the chip off your shoulder. Many Scots are proud to be Brits and will fight for the union. 2/3 of your money/trade comes from rUK. Your money? Your economy is tiny and shrinking. Oil and gas is all but gone

5343 2018-03-24 18:42:19 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
5344 2018-03-24 18:41:51 Good luck then xD but I don't really think it's gonna work? Unless maybe you use acrylic or oil paint?
5345 2018-03-24 18:41:44 Water, castor oil, then shea butter to seal in moisture with bantu knots or twist out.

5355 2018-03-24 18:41:00 You were fighting relegation in that same Premier League before Shinawatra and then oil money. What a joke. 
5356 2018-03-24 18:40:53 use of an improper tool or carelessness, oil filter had been “serrated on the side” causing detrimental leak -> ‘rod knock’. now need an entire engine replacement, intake boost boots and turbo included. gutted. at least they offered me a $500 trade-in if I buy a new-year model!
5357 2018-03-24 18:40:42 One can say that about environmentalists as well, this is a full time job for them. More educated people = less $ for them.

Change needs to happen, but it has to be a gradual change. 

Also, I don’t work in the oil industry anymore, nor does my current job depend on it either.
5358 2018-03-24 18:40:32 Get him off that medication. Charlottes Web CBD oil stops seizures in children.
5359 2018-03-24 18:40:14 I will when I get home, I'm on my way to get him CBD oil haha
5360 2018-03-24 18:40:13 Don't worry. Enough people selling snake oil.

5362 2018-03-24 18:39:54 I write w/ a broken heart & battered engine. I was the proud owner of a 2010 Subaru Forester XT affectionately known as ’black beauty’. thought my story deserves sharing. According to Subaru of CC,NV the last party to change oil did so irresponsibly. Subaru did the work...
5363 2018-03-24 18:39:32 What's the difference between a micellar with or without oil? Mine's the pink version without oil.
5364 2018-03-24 18:39:32 me: *starts putting coconut oil on my lips*
teacher: what are you doing?

teacher: it looked like you sniffing it, like you were doing drugs
me: BRUH
5365 2018-03-24 18:39:30 here in the Netherlands i only here positive stories when cannabis (oil) is used by patients with chronicle (pain) problems. Therefore It should also be legal in UK.
5366 2018-03-24 18:39:29 They say 10 minutes and it's been about a half hour. I just want some new oil, man.

5369 2018-03-24 18:39:19 We need 2 take out the trash! Snake oil sales & con people. Laws need 2 b made that they can't accept money from Lobbyists and Special interest, Wall Street, etc. They work 10am to 4pm three days a week. If u aren't working 4 #WETHEPROPLE GTFO.

5372 2018-03-24 18:38:50 I'm remembering why I don't go to "oil change" shops.
5373 2018-03-24 18:38:41 Mechanics wear disposable gloves now when they work on your car or change the oil. They don't charge extra for the gloves. Do pediatricians charge extra for the use of tongue depressors?

5378 2018-03-24 18:38:13 #MarchForOurLives is an example of why the liberal agenda had progressed. Sqeeky wheel gets the oil. Conservatives aren't the loud & rowdy pro-active types. We leave it to others to fight our fights, like the NRA and our representatives but that's not working anymore.
5379 2018-03-24 18:38:12 Eating healthy idea.

1 12oz can of tuna in water not oil

1 tablespoon liquid smoke

Mix and enjoy 44.5 grams of protein and virtually fat free, super low carbs also!

5386 2018-03-24 18:37:20 Funny how alamists pay so much attention to "big oil"
I couldn't care less what Exxon says. They want to sell more and say about anything to accomplish that. First they were accused by alarmists of spreading disinformation. Now they switched to the "green team" they are all right

5390 2018-03-24 18:35:53 Right?? Different beasts. I love peanut butter and peanut oil but eating peanuts is not for me, especially raw ones. #nutchat
5391 2018-03-24 18:35:51 Soot has nothing to do with legal oil production. Entirely from artisanal refining and the military burning such sites. The solution requires the kind of cooperative and imaginative efforts that is beyond our govts
5392 2018-03-24 18:35:43 I asked my dad to teach me how to change my oil and change a flat tire and he is mad that I want to learn ??
5393 2018-03-24 18:35:38 Walmart talking about a damn 3 hour wait for an oil change bitch who I’m finna get some food and go get back in my bed they too high
5394 2018-03-24 18:35:32 Not an avocado fan....like at all BUT it’s better than that oil and butter you’re putting in the batter.
5395 2018-03-24 18:35:28 slightly awkward (?) to smell like oil and fish though
5396 2018-03-24 18:35:18 control of oil since the embargo has cost trillions

5408 2018-03-24 18:33:59 Ni al oil responde la hija de puta. Esa solo responde al embi argento nada más.
5409 2018-03-24 18:33:47 Sounds like Irish Soda Bread which is tasty too. The next loaf I am going to try olive oil and honey!
5410 2018-03-24 18:33:46 I got to get my oil changed and they tell me about all the other stuff I need done to my car 
5411 2018-03-24 18:33:41 I craving some bomb palm oil okra or some peanut butter soup. Too bad I have neither 
5412 2018-03-24 18:33:40 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
5413 2018-03-24 18:33:23 The US should converr some of its consumption from oil to gas snd export oil instead.
5414 2018-03-24 18:33:10 I used sesame oil instead of nuts :)
5415 2018-03-24 18:32:53 my oil changes are $50 lolol

5417 2018-03-24 18:32:37 I got to learn how to work on cars, cause these folks can try to run the bill up on you just during an oil change
5418 2018-03-24 18:32:17 You are driving in Indianapolis today, please be careful. I’m driving by the Lucas Oil Stadium right now and I can’t even see it because of the snow.

5422 2018-03-24 18:31:35 Oh goodness. If true, it would be the FIRST TIME IN RECORDED HISTORY that young men used oil money to buy big trucks, and then drove them too fast.
5423 2018-03-24 18:31:27 I really took for granted basic things my parents did for me like now I WISH I had the $ to: get a haircut, get an oil change, buy groceries consistently, go to the doctor. 
5424 2018-03-24 18:31:27 The special today starts with  Pu pu platter as the appetizer and then as the main dish unripe Steak with  Olive oil to drink.
5425 2018-03-24 18:31:23 Well we've now seen what spending has accomplished and it isnt working our recovery has more to do with oil price recovery than any spending we did. We spend more than BC on public sector and have a lower population. Not sure how you could say we wernet debt free we were for
5426 2018-03-24 18:31:17 Sure looks a lot more like the black panther/power salute to me.

5442 2018-03-24 18:29:26 Oil should be dead. We have new technologies to produce energy. Car manufacturers are finally listening to consumers and are producing more hybrids.  Wind and solar ARE viable. I hope to see the demolition of big oil companies in my lifetime.
5443 2018-03-24 18:29:17 Got up and didn’t see my car outside and my mom told me my papa came and got it to get my oil changed. I’m so spoiled.

5446 2018-03-24 18:28:50 Totalmente! Ahí esta, en trasportes, concentrado el grueso del sobre costo del gas oil por diferencia con paridad.

5456 2018-03-24 18:26:16 Anyone w/sense has to wonder if Cambridge Analytica wasn't selling snake oil. If advertising were that good we'd all be wearing #snuggies. But w/r/t POLITICS many base their choice not on deeply considered policy issues, but rather on self-identity emotion & often low information
5457 2018-03-24 18:26:07 It's illogic based on little or no experience managing other people's money. #NoEstimates has become a business of selling snake oil to unsuspecting, illtreated developers looking for sympathy for this bad lot in life of working under bad management. W & V capitalizing on this
5458 2018-03-24 18:25:56 Pruitt wants 2 dismantle the EPA. He will destroy our environment 2 benefit the oil industry. He’s in their pocket, which is why Trump put him there. The whole cabinet is there 4 their own enrichment. Not 2 help us. They are all interested in autocratic Rule. They ignore science
5459 2018-03-24 18:25:52 Nothing wrong with Hydrogen. A consortium of polluting automakers and oil companies we are more suspicious of..

5466 2018-03-24 18:25:21 I have been coordinating efforts to destroy AB with @RachelNotley. We are making great progress. Today,
I can report that @atbfinancial, at the direction of my Weather Minister, will soon commence a program of firing many employees thus reducing liquidity in the AB oil sector.
5467 2018-03-24 18:25:06 If it's gooey, like sticker residue, let some olive oil soak in and then clean with super hot water.
5468 2018-03-24 18:25:06 It is a cast part and likely a high Zinc content pit metal.  As such, a normal metal drill should be fine with oil and just enough pressure to ensure it cuts cleanly.
5469 2018-03-24 18:24:56 Olive oil is not awesome either, so saying they're as good isn't a huge selling point in my view.

5478 2018-03-24 18:23:45 ...game and it just transferred massive infrastructure costs to a future govt to play catch up with. It also has to be considered or questioned why after years of record oil prices, were we broke the moment the price dropped forcing govt to run a debt to keep the weeks turning.
5479 2018-03-24 18:23:32 Try putting the stretch mark cream/oil when it itches but try your hardest not to scratch 
5480 2018-03-24 18:23:28 You don't give one damn about the national interest. There's numerous ways your province which has squandered your decades of oil money could renew your economy and do without this pipeline. Your just pandering to win an election. Good luck with that #Alberta #bcpoli
5481 2018-03-24 18:23:25 OMG they could wear parts of the machinery. Use bits as buttons, or clasps. Even use a big flat bit as the brim for a hat. Wire for shoe laces or stitches to mend clothes. Pretty glowing hair pins. Futuristic machine oil as grease for their hair.

5487 2018-03-24 18:22:18 Im not arguing that oil doesnt have its uses, obviously it does. Im just saying 15c a litre on gasoline doesnt seem like a great trade off for the amount of GhG a second pipe would create. Exsisting infrastructure is sufficient.

I bought a case of oil and two filters; enough for two changes ... I’d rather be the guy doing my own oil, since the last time I got someone else to do it they didn’t tighten the oil cap the entire way.
5499 2018-03-24 18:19:11 What we need to do is negotiate a shared Northern Right Of Way with plenty of Indigenous & Local Resident ownership that enables both LNG and Oil pipelines & ports. Even plenty of the GVA anti-pipeline activists are beginning to see the sense of northern routes.

If we need more oil shipped in the short term (debatable), while we expand #AlternativeEnergy, we should ship by rail.  Sure, make rail safer too, but don't invest $$$ in pipelines that will be in dedicated operation for decades & create a clean-up nightmare.

5568 2018-03-24 18:09:39 Even earlier: when first oil companies started setting up, former pearl divers, from a dying industry, took on hard labor jobs since skill sets weren’t apt for the office—which then led to Gulf importing teachers (mostly frm Levant & Egypt) to develop education system for skills.

5587 2018-03-24 18:06:52 On using #dilbit.

One barrel of oil = 160 L.
It's ~0.8 kg/L, so ~128 kg.
It's ~80% carbon, so ~102 kg of carbon per barrel.
CO2 is ~3.5 x the weight of carbon per mole, so there's  potential for ~350 kg CO2 if burned completely (no ash, no CO).

5643 2018-03-24 17:58:38 I have CDs of the MRI with dye to prove it. There's no treatment for kidney cancer. Only treatment is remove the kidney. Weed oil fix that. It eats the cancer don't let the government fool you.

5652 2018-03-24 17:57:53 About 10 years ago in Kenya, a low income earner with 100 was sure of buying Unga, cooking oil, 'mboga', kerosene plus water to have the family sorted out. Right now if some1 with a family has 100, anaeza buy tu 'KDF' 4 the family na wakose kupata maji ya kuteremsha nayo

5655 2018-03-24 17:57:41 I don't know about olive oil "producing" something, but its smoke point is about on par with butter so deep frying really isn't a good idea. Canola can handle nearly 100C higher(around 500F).

5663 2018-03-24 17:56:52 I demand that @jeremycorbyn punish Scotland for our disobedience by forcing us to accept full independence, take our oil & other resources & slink off.  We'll simply have to follow orders. Woe is me.

5666 2018-03-24 17:56:43 Right on Dan!  People hear “oil” and think gas that goes in vehicles.  They don’t think about polymers & plastics in everyday use that rely on petro.  That includes your TV, and the device you are SJW tweeting on!....just crazy!

5671 2018-03-24 17:56:08 Not a hoax, just something approximating a moral panic over what amounts to mostly snake oil, at least partly to avoid seeing manifest destiny was anything but.

5674 2018-03-24 17:56:00 Be sure to stock up on 'palm oil'
5675 2018-03-24 17:55:45 My husband has chronic migraines/social anxiety too and cannabis really helped him. If you don't have access to it, we've also used CBD oil or hemp oil. It has the same medical benefits as cannabis without the psychoactive effects

5677 2018-03-24 17:55:33 It's most likely because olive oil has an incredibly low smoke point, about on par with butter. Don't put oil in a pan without whatever you're cooking for more than a second or so, unless you like burning and gnashing of teeth.
5678 2018-03-24 17:55:29 I think my oil needs to be checked 
5679 2018-03-24 17:55:07 This is why #BokoHaram is fake in #Nigeria, actual issue is in the #Niger Delta area in the South, mainly #Christian areas where #BP & #Shell extract #Oil dumping waste in the Rivers, so insurgents sabotage Pipelines constantly, diversion is #Islamist threat i.e., #BokoHaram

5685 2018-03-24 17:53:41 I hope so, but all my oil relates stocks getting stuck in this sell off
5686 2018-03-24 17:53:37 Lack of gun control is a major prob, but it's a symptom of a greater issue - money in politics. Get the money out of our government & you limit the control groups like the NRA, big oil, telcos and military contractors have to circumvent the will of the people. #MarchForOurLives
5687 2018-03-24 17:53:31 Já jsem kradl v Rusku ? Informace získávám z veřejných sdělovacích prostředků a jména firem si do hlavy neberu, je to většinou samei "oil" a zlodějina kolem přírodního bohatství, na které byli zápaďáci zaměřeni. Nemám čas jen na tebe.
5688 2018-03-24 17:53:23 Well I can’t go nowhere ashy and I can’t find my baby oil gel 
5689 2018-03-24 17:53:04 bio oil helps! or you can buy marine essence soap, it does wonderz!! and remember to apply lotion. cetaphil lotion is good 
5690 2018-03-24 17:52:57 I just thought that America buys oil from Saudi Arab. Why doesn't Canada buy it from there?
5691 2018-03-24 17:52:40 I don't actively trade, no. I stick to traditional stofks, more stable. Some of the tech is cool, but nothing established yet and too much is snake oil pumped up by hype
5692 2018-03-24 17:52:38 Great illustrative. This is exactly why I strongly believe Unconventional oil is massively overbooked. If proved true, the implications to supply fundamentals in the ‘20’s will be huge.

5697 2018-03-24 17:51:53 Absolutely, President Trump has been outstanding. No other President since Ronald Reagan, has supported our Country's Military. Our steel Mills are coming back and our own oil. We never should have eliminated our railways.

5701 2018-03-24 17:51:01 Be patient, drink water and eat healthy. You should wash it twice a week, air dry it, oil it maybe two or three times a week and do protective styles so that it does not break.
5702 2018-03-24 17:51:01 Ironically I just used the new Sisley hair ritual oil today and fell in love immediately 
5703 2018-03-24 17:50:59 As long as we are using oil, pipelines are safer, use less energy, and have a smaller carbon footprint than using Warren Buffett's railroads to move oil.   You want to really solve the problem, then support nuclear power, anything else is scientifically and economically unsound.

5724 2018-03-24 17:46:54 Maybe someone in the movement can answer this: do you all have any idea of all the products that comes from oil, gas and coal? Are you prepared to do without them? We are quietly waiting for your response.
5725 2018-03-24 17:46:52 Saddam wanted to hold back oil supplies to the rest of the world. So Big Brother USA had to intervene.

They wanted the Holocaust to create worldwide support for their creation of a base of operations in the oil producing region.

5782 2018-03-24 17:39:08 The answer may well be "it would cost money to build and anyway it's cheaper to refine in low-wage, environment-hostile Texas." Honestly, I suspect a refinery built by Canadians would annoy pipeline-co owners like Koch Bros, & Canadians could use domestic oil instead of buying US

5786 2018-03-24 17:38:46 Agreed. Trump and the government should. But trump and his crazy nines and trying to dismantle the government do they can get bigger tax breaks, drill for oil in national parks and sexually harrass whoever they want.

5788 2018-03-24 17:38:32 Matthews is wrong--when Schlafley was stopping the progress of women, they went ALL IN FOR BIG REGULATIONS, which ushered in a rigid Reagan, out of oil, they FORCED bigtrucks&Hummers to replace Toyota-trend.THEN was when gun-guys emerged.@MSNBC

5791 2018-03-24 17:37:34 @hairrituel Tried the oil today and it was heavenly!!! Hair feels amazing, dried faster than usual and smells fantastic 
5792 2018-03-24 17:37:22 @rockcenternyc Well, bugger me are you the powerhouse of the enigmatic oil empire?
Are you proud of future developments, possibly not. Greed, greed ...what a culture, hardly saves the !
5793 2018-03-24 17:37:20 Ferrari are unhappy because they can't use their oil recycling mode like they could in the past. Now the oil just pees into the wind, as we all saw in the smoke stream at Barca, instead of being put to good use in qualie mode. Why else are they moaning AGAIN
5794 2018-03-24 17:37:13 They use peanut oil. You're cured!!
5795 2018-03-24 17:37:12 Valvoline instant oil change take like 20 minutes max
5796 2018-03-24 17:37:08 How about we institute the death penalty for elected officials that are financially supported by pharmaceutical companies?  Or anyone caught dealing death from the @US_FDA? Classifying CBD oil as a narcotic should show you how corrupt the system is.@FoxNews @CNN @nytimes @latimes
5797 2018-03-24 17:37:03 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
5798 2018-03-24 17:36:56 @Kimzolciak @BrielleZolciak If I could get a candle or oil with the @KashmereKollect scent... I’d be the happiest girl alive  Make it happpeennnn!! 
5799 2018-03-24 17:36:46 Calm down mechanic guy. Just here for an oil change. lf l wanted to know about all the other shit wrong with my car l'd turn the radio down.
5800 2018-03-24 17:36:46 @trumpwallnow  Wall is dead...Trump was selling snake oil. Rich got tax break we got nothing.

5804 2018-03-24 17:36:15 need ah oil change 
5805 2018-03-24 17:36:05 Totally ignoring facts and the actual oil industry! You must be UCP!
5806 2018-03-24 17:36:03 Cooking oil, not me.
5807 2018-03-24 17:35:58 How am I driving down the duel carriage way and my Speedo goes, battery, oil and engine light come on and then engine cuts out  going back to BMX and Scooters! #ImOut
5808 2018-03-24 17:35:57 Iraqi oil will pay for their, “liberation,” thereby not costing Americans a dime. W/Cheney insisted that is the case. Remember?
5809 2018-03-24 17:35:49 Half the state is protected land but there are lots of people there so you’re better off living in one of the states where oil companies can blow up the earth under your house without asking you.
5810 2018-03-24 17:35:47 Lambo? Unrealiable? 2000 dollar oil chain..?
5811 2018-03-24 17:35:46 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
5812 2018-03-24 17:35:27 Tweeting live from #TheCalgaryForum: Canadian Oil production has gone down over 46% in the last 8 years, meanwhile the US has increased by 26%. We need to make a case for the Canadian Energy Industry and make Canada the top competitor in OUR industry.
5813 2018-03-24 17:35:06 Shhhh . . . You're spoiling the narrative.
5814 2018-03-24 17:34:58 wow apparently i ordered one of those essential oil vape pens while i was dr*nk last night
5815 2018-03-24 17:34:57 None of which have a hope in hell of being built, especially by the right wing sell outs to big oil that’s Alberta’s opposition party!

5817 2018-03-24 17:34:39 Cringeworthy. The betrayal of people in Britain by the media and the political class is abhorant. Sold out repeatedly to oil, Israeli lobby, the US, foreign oligarchs and the Tory elites. How sad for those who've died or are dying for and because of this. No more heroes.
5818 2018-03-24 17:34:33 I was about to cook and I’ve just realized that I don’t have cooking oil 
5819 2018-03-24 17:34:31 Me, waiting for my oil to be changed, no rps to reply to
5820 2018-03-24 17:34:28 @SisleyParisUsa #hairritualsquad That haircare oil!!!!! Wonderful feels like silk and smells fabulous 
5821 2018-03-24 17:34:26 canola oil stan omg
5822 2018-03-24 17:34:26 Is it “fixed” yet? I’ve never seen a beard that was “fixed” without needing enough oil to attract the US military.
5823 2018-03-24 17:34:25 At this point I think around 30% of my body is pure olive oil.
5824 2018-03-24 17:34:25 May mother nature and all the host of the Universe dry up Nigeria Oil wells. 
Then we shall make progress.
5825 2018-03-24 17:34:12 How about we institute the death penalty for elected officials that are financially supported by pharmaceutical companies?  Or anyone caught dealing death from the @US_FDA? Classifying CBD oil as a narcotic should show you how corrupt the system is.

5828 2018-03-24 17:34:01 They said my use of CBD oil was illegal... I'm calling my lawyer! Grrr
5829 2018-03-24 17:33:48 @WhiteHouse and our thoughts and prayers are with fallen America ...you were selling snake oil all along  Never vote again conservative.  Rich got tax break we got nothing.....forget mid terms forget the big beautiful wall  ..
5830 2018-03-24 17:33:31 Essential oil baths don't draw out toxins. That's your kidneys, and they're better at it. You flush the toxins down the toilet, you don't bathe them out in the tub. It also doesn't balance your pH. If your pH were unbalanced, you'd be dead.
5831 2018-03-24 17:33:28 Don't do chemo. Get on that cannabis oil asap
5832 2018-03-24 17:33:25 Bet we will get by just fine without your contributions. And your high tech and oil.
5833 2018-03-24 17:33:15 Yeah, go ahead and vote her out! Kenney will fail and Alberta will become a pathetic right wing backwater that’s squandered it wealth feeding international oil companies!
5834 2018-03-24 17:33:12 Is this oil or acrylic?
5835 2018-03-24 17:33:11 Oil spills are catastrophic to local marine wildlife. If we don't prevent this soon there will be no more plenty of fish in the sea!  #Lesson10 #WaterPollution #PHYS273
5836 2018-03-24 17:33:00 Time to vent. I dropped my car off at 10:30 this morning for any oil change at @Walmart. (First mistake). They tell me the oil it takes and that they have it. I even brought my own filter. I get back 3 hours later for pick up and they tell me
5837 2018-03-24 17:32:50 โหววว หนุกแน่นอน รอๆๆ 
5838 2018-03-24 17:32:20 Caveat emptor. Develop your critical thinking skills, people. Snake oil salesmen are still with us....and will always be.

5840 2018-03-24 17:32:19 my oil diffuser is really THAT bich, ugh love her
5841 2018-03-24 17:32:08 When your tanning oil attracts bees .... 
5842 2018-03-24 17:31:55 No she doesn’t have the “right” to break the law. Get your head out of the sand. Canadian oil and gas development is the most environmentally responsible in the world.
5843 2018-03-24 17:31:53 As blessed as Nigeria could've been Crude Oil has brought more division to us as a nation in so many ways setting us behind many nations.
5844 2018-03-24 17:31:50 Using olive oil to scramble your eggs gives them that perfect fluff
5845 2018-03-24 17:31:41 My brother works in the oil patch on salary, and... Honestly, I think his salary versus hours worked is criminal.

5847 2018-03-24 17:31:31 I hear argon oil provides added bounce, but go easy on the turmeric!!!
5848 2018-03-24 17:31:28 @foxandfriends Wow he was selling snake oil all along. Rich got tax break we gotothing. don't care about ex orders will never support your show again or any conservative liars. Goodbye America
5849 2018-03-24 17:31:26 Lol....funny tho I give you that. It's just somewhat annoying that a club our size would still be stuck in financial mud. I sometimes wonder if selling to the oil oligarchs would be better...just a wild thought tho.
5850 2018-03-24 17:31:08 I make a diy lipbalm with beeswax, coconut oil and some other stuff. The real money is not in raw materials. A farsighted entrepreneur could mint money selling a range of branded Indian skincare with beeswax as the star ingredient.
5851 2018-03-24 17:30:59 Let's interrogate the Zim Open for business mantra. Do you think we cannot rebuild our industries as Zimbabweans owning them and having access to international capital? Soap and cooking oil are not sophisticated industries to celebrate foreigners coming. It's colonialism too
5852 2018-03-24 17:30:48 Coconut oil a wipe that shit clean off
5853 2018-03-24 17:30:46 Boiling oil over the doors
5854 2018-03-24 17:30:42 You can keep all your coal and steel mills. You can even keep your high tech. I can do with oil.
5855 2018-03-24 17:30:25 Whether you use the finest named brand paints, custom collected pigments in linseed oil, crayons, graphite pencils or blue ballpoint pens, a true artist will bring beauty to life no matter the material. This piece is amazing. Your work is captivating.
5856 2018-03-24 17:30:06 I use it once a week because my hair becomes naturally oily after a while & the cooking oil already adds shine & oily ness to your hair so I just use it once.

5858 2018-03-24 17:29:48 They're coming -- the Chairlift Paintings are coming! 
Arriving next week in the gallery are two fresh oil paintings from Vermont artist Rebecca Kinkead in her "Last Run" series. Don't you love that final run of the day?
5859 2018-03-24 17:29:48 Great tweet. @realDonaldTrump is a con man selling snake oil.
5860 2018-03-24 17:29:42 @jesse_b_waters He was selling snake oil along. Goodbye America and will never watch so called conservative TV again  Pelosi and Chuck  promised him a deal no impeachment  Rich got tax bill we got nothing.  so sad
5861 2018-03-24 17:29:21 Bearing in mind the age profile of Facebook users and the result of the referendum it doesn't seem to have had much effect either. People taking too literally the hype from the snake oil salesmen.
5862 2018-03-24 17:29:20 Goes to get oil changed, Jeep running great. Once I park at the shop the Jeep won’t budge, tires are locked #happysaturday

5864 2018-03-24 17:28:59 Reminds me of my energy econ professor telling us how the world’s supply of oil will never be exhausted - the last barrels of oil will not be extracted because it would have cost too much.
5865 2018-03-24 17:28:48 had a friend who was obsessed with fat, she misted olive oil onto her potatoes to roast them.
Oddly she always preferred my roasties...
5866 2018-03-24 17:28:47 I use eggs oil and honey for my face lol but I’m about to start doing it how many times a week?
5867 2018-03-24 17:28:42 Now that guy deserves to be served eggs fried nge castor oil Lol
5868 2018-03-24 17:28:41 Foolishness to the core, how can same tax levied 4a car & sugar, oil etc.not all the fingers are same so also taxes must be different according to category. Can u introduce same income tax to all irrespective of income.Stop making gold from potato like senseless tweet Chang admin
5869 2018-03-24 17:28:41 I was surprised to see that there were around 400 truck and rail oil spills every year in Canada. It still seems like a lot even though they carry much less oil then large tankers or pipelines #Lesson10 #phys273
5870 2018-03-24 17:28:35 Honda. Buy them, drive them, change the oil & drive them some more. Great vehicles.
5871 2018-03-24 17:28:22 "When all the Big Oil companies are willing to say, clearly and unambiguously, that humans burning fossil fuels are warming the planet, it means that the terms of debate have shifted."
I guess that's a step in the right direction? But long overdue.
5872 2018-03-24 17:28:18 I will say, it can *sometimes* be nice to have a Saturday without IU baseball. I have done a load and a half of laundry, been to the post office, gotten my oil changed, had my eyebrows waxed, and done half of my shopping. Yay for productivity.
5873 2018-03-24 17:28:15 America's biggest issue is that most of the snake oil salesman are also clients.
5874 2018-03-24 17:27:57 i just got out of the shower now 2 slather my body in coconut oil so i will be the softest being on this earth
5875 2018-03-24 17:27:50 Walked back in and they all opposed changing carbon emissions because it would hurt our oil industry jfc
5876 2018-03-24 17:27:40 I have rice... I don't think the chickens have laid me anything yet though.  Also not 100% sure the place I'm house sitting  at has cooking oil?
5877 2018-03-24 17:27:34 Yes that’s all I use lol. & with the egg just mix it with your conditioner leave it in for 10/15 minutes or however long you leave it and then wash it out. & with the cooking oil just put a dab on the palm of your hand & rub it together and rub it through your hair
5878 2018-03-24 17:27:33 @rushlimbaugh He was selling snake oil all along. Tax bill for rich nothing for us. Never vote for republican again  Goodbye america
5879 2018-03-24 17:27:23 Watching this March for our lives rally got me crying my eyes out while waiting for my oil change. In such a baby lol
5880 2018-03-24 17:27:21 I accidentally used Batiste as deodorant this morning and you know what? I still feel fresh, dry and tropically oil free 
5881 2018-03-24 17:27:07 You cant just request an oil change at jiffy lube without them convincing you that you need new break pads, new filters, a tire rotation, a haircut and a better personality
5882 2018-03-24 17:26:59 Look up Iron and Earth tberes already oil workers trying to get this. I am not your enemy

5886 2018-03-24 17:26:35 @BrionyPenn @ElizabethMay @kennedystewart you make us proud as Canadians. @JustinTrudeau take note. I understand we can't completely give up on fossil fuels, but it must benefit Canadians more than oil companies. Fossil Fuels are the past. Green and Renewable is the future!

5888 2018-03-24 17:26:25 I can’t go there! They use peanut oil

5896 2018-03-24 17:25:08 @RogMillions didn't these NDP and others constantly bitch about PCs reliance on oil ...diversification bla bla bla #bullshitNDP
5897 2018-03-24 17:24:46 The program is now used to replace low income positions, so all Canadians can work in the oil field.
5898 2018-03-24 17:24:44 I very much dislike when ppl use oil to cook eggs, unless you’re frying your egg hard just use butter.
5899 2018-03-24 17:24:40 genXer's sat in class watching airplanes erasing immovable landmarks- as far away as texas this profoundly affected kids who had ZERO coping/mental health programs, just instructions on getting under tables. next came dubya's illegal oil war and they gave up. mine did. til NOW.
5900 2018-03-24 17:24:39 Before Cda feels the pinch the USA and their high consumption will have to flip to "foriegn" oil which will spike the US prices super high because everything has a shipping price attached to it now. It will hurt the US first and quicker. CDA could refine and consume its own
5901 2018-03-24 17:24:23 I made an appointment to get my oil changed without my husband having to tell me to and I feel so responsible wow.
5902 2018-03-24 17:24:11 we need to stop hyping up coconut oil if you have dry skin aloe is where its at

5910 2018-03-24 17:23:24 The program was designed to help Canada hire workers for the oil field when demand was higher then supply.

Or more importantly. I've been out of my bed for 4 hours on a Saturday. This is the devil at work.
5927 2018-03-24 17:20:40 living on my own has taught me a plethora of wonderful things; like not to put too much oil in the pan, or else
5928 2018-03-24 17:20:39 Just got out the shower and moisturized my body with a whipped coco butter-Shea-coconut cream . Then topped it off with this coco-honey body oil  I smell and feel soooooo goooood. Too bad I’m not getting dick today

5932 2018-03-24 17:20:17 A delirious Rick Santorum carefully explains to President Trump that the McCains are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Adam Sandler trolls the President on Twitter.
5933 2018-03-24 17:20:12 last night i went to an essential oil party and they indirectly informed me that they are the cure for cancer, mental illness, and any deficits in physical health
5934 2018-03-24 17:19:56 What a difference a few decades can make. In my day anti-pipeline protesters called themselves anti-nuclear energy, and as an aside, they were viciously anti-America. Todays’s bunch is practically employed by American oil industry and without shame.  #cdnpoli #abpoli
5935 2018-03-24 17:19:52 I live in OK too. Work in software development.... for oil and gas lol. Your tweet resonates so much lol

5941 2018-03-24 17:18:55 Who are you trying to kid?  
I've no doubt Saudi oil interests already own a slice of the US oil boom!    
5942 2018-03-24 17:18:33 One of the commenters on the video was able to verify that based on an oil rig.
5943 2018-03-24 17:18:24 @IngrahamAngle SADDEST DAY EVER..... He was selling snake oil all along.  You were the only one who spoke to US..the people.  You are a great  American and person. Thanks   Have an idea..Pelosi and chuck promised trump no impeachment after midterms.
5944 2018-03-24 17:18:22 Agreed.  The entire point of the War In Iraq was just so W. could hand out oil leases to his Texas friends.
5945 2018-03-24 17:18:12 arguing mining concentration is a bit like claiming oil futures are risky because the miners & refiners could set their equipment on fire. they _could_, but it's so bizarrely irrational and unlikely as to not merit serious consideration.
5946 2018-03-24 17:18:10 AquaTuff Liquid Supplier in Fujairah Oil Terminal...
5947 2018-03-24 17:18:09 Korean skincare and rosehip oil are the answers to all of my problems.
5948 2018-03-24 17:18:07 That is one of the few names on my list on weekly terms.
Yes, there are some miners and oil names but I've had some exposure last week or two.
5949 2018-03-24 17:18:02 Suggesting that all Cambridge Analytical are guilty of is selling snake oil to their clients, who desperately wanted believe in CA's 'magic'....

5951 2018-03-24 17:17:46 that’s it. i’m going back to how i used to color with oil pastels. i swear its gonna look pretty!
5952 2018-03-24 17:17:35 A definite highlight of my day was watching the carousel of progress robot aggressively leak water/oil out of its arm for the entirety of a scene.
5953 2018-03-24 17:17:35 ياجماعة ماحد ياخد الكيميا الطبيعية والتحليلية ويرجعلنا الـ crude oil تانى 
5954 2018-03-24 17:17:31 "You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows" (Ps 23:5). We don’t live long before acquiring some hurts. Whether it’s from someone we trusted or that our bodies fail us and get sick. The Good Shepherd understands our hurts. His hands bring healing and help to us. #ComeAlive

5958 2018-03-24 17:17:11 I was just crushed when he made their big “environmental” pipeline announcement. No country would leave oil in the ground.... Fuuuuuck yoouuuuu!! ;p Sure, we have a big oil industry. But we should be aggressively transitioning away from it. Gawd!

5960 2018-03-24 17:17:03 I put coconut oil in my hair on Wed ok, expecting it to make my hair super healthy. I’ve literally washed it about 10 times since then and my hair is still suuuuper oily help

5962 2018-03-24 17:16:42 She is courageous and has every right to stand up for what she believes in as this is a free country even for those who don’t believe in selling out to big oil.
5963 2018-03-24 17:15:54 Your tweets about going outside inspired me. I took my dog for a groom, got my oil changed and bought groceries.. all before noon today. My mind and body can rest all weekend. 
5964 2018-03-24 17:15:47 Blend 2 1/2 pints enchilada with 3 pints green beans. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Fry. Serve over kale.
5965 2018-03-24 17:15:44 Canadian lawmakers are beholden to oil money. But don’t worry, the world is moving away from fossil fuels and economics will kill this pipeline long before it’s built. Just look at Exxon mobile and kinder Morgan stock over the past year

5977 2018-03-24 17:14:26 Internet should be a public utility  that is paid by our Public Revenue that we should be getting from oil companies an pharmaceuticals that use our tax dollars to found their research and development.  How about that for a policy idea?

5983 2018-03-24 17:12:54 I’ll bet the first thing students say is that you need to increase teacher pay to egregious levels and in return that will allow them to produce better grades. More pay is always the Liberals’ secret elixir. More like snake oil.
5984 2018-03-24 17:12:51 does anyone have some cooking oil lmbo

5993 2018-03-24 17:11:36 My dad just showed me that you can reset the oil change reminder on my car by turning the car to "on" so its not actually running and flooring the gas 4 times. What kind of Nintendo cheat code stuff is this?
5994 2018-03-24 17:11:33 I got one interesting news form news channels, CBN is asking about gas and oil was stolening from AP, he remembered now? He is using 40yrs experience to divert the allegations which came from central @ncbn @PawanKalyan @YSRCParty @ysjagan @TV9Telugu @NtvteluguHD

5998 2018-03-24 17:10:56 It’s ridiculous. I tweeted @SenSchumer videos several times. He’s a snake oil salesman.  Just after the omnibus was approved, he went on to say the Dems got what they wanted, their priority issues. However, yet again, no #DACA. They now know Dems don’t care about them. POTUS does
5999 2018-03-24 17:10:54 Nervous as hell and trying to kill time. Already washed dishes, changed the oil in my car, did some work on the other car, 4 hours to go.

Reduce the gov't work force by 30% to take advantage of technology that government has refused to embrace. It has happened in manufacturing and oil patch 

Pubic would not even notice 
Economy would boom

6020 2018-03-24 17:07:40 They let the front line pawns have free healthcare, as costs are more than offset by profits for the military-industrial complex, including oil. 

ME oil wealth is more than ever being squandered for warfare. 

USA is a 'clever' imperialist leech.

Israel and KSA are stupid, imo.
6021 2018-03-24 17:07:37 *wouldn't* live forever that was meant to be.

6026 2018-03-24 17:07:07 Just got thru changing the oil, checking the lights, and checked the tires on ma's Toyota.  Found a tag light out. Glad i checked it. After i eat i get to do the same thing to my F-150. Fun, fun. :)
6027 2018-03-24 17:07:07 Pre-flight rituals: getting magazines, water and mint mentos. Taking rescue remedy and dousing my palms with calm essential oil. Calling my best friend Jen and having a chat. I’m not a nervous flyer, but these are nervous times.

Understanding that potable water is more important than oil now. You were given the reins by activists. WTF?

6037 2018-03-24 17:05:46 Before the NDDC act became law, I went on 7day tour to the Niger Delta with Lawmakers for assessment. It was an eye opener to the devastation oil exploration has caused the region. Not all Northerners know this, same way southerners don't know about poverty/almajiris in the North

6049 2018-03-24 17:04:43 there's been a pipeline there already since the 50's, not one catastrophe, spending several million a year on securing it is still an improvement on the current discount Canadian oil is being sold at
6050 2018-03-24 17:04:36 I didnt have it last night but will be trying it later today. I was impressed with old engine oil.
6051 2018-03-24 17:04:22 Let’s hope that they are criminally charged and serve jail time. They both know better, they know pipelines are the safest way to transport oil and that Canada’s producers lead globally in responsible development. They are grandstanding to drive donations based on falsehoods.
6052 2018-03-24 17:04:10 Here in Caraga, most IP Ed schools entered the communities for the further expansion of mining and palm oil plantations. It's only a matter of time that the we realize the reason for its establishment: economic interests of corporations on the ancestral lands.

6208 2018-03-24 16:44:05 I agree almost entirely.  Even now, with Cam back in form, a real PK, a PP that looks better, logical lines, tad more speed, Oil are back around last years level.
6209 2018-03-24 16:44:00 Good video, went too fast for me to read, had to repeat,
only have one disagreement.....no way could I ever take Castor oil, was given that as a child, yuk!  
6210 2018-03-24 16:43:55 I like that the salary she draws is predominantly paid for by the taxes taken from the oil and gas industry.  Hypocrites. She should walk the walk and shut off her heat and walk everywhere she goes. Long walk from B.c. to Ottawa, they wouldn’t miss her in the HOC I’m guessing.
6211 2018-03-24 16:43:49 I would have been good if it ended with Existence as well. The problem w/ S8 for me was that they dumped the black oil for the super soldiers, which then inexplicably became about Billy Miles, they had to bring in Doggett, the vaccine aspect got needlessly convoluted...
6212 2018-03-24 16:43:47 Apologize to West Canadians for abandoning them on oil and devastating economy. Pretend Trans Can pipe is Bombardier and give a shit

6221 2018-03-24 16:43:09 Not only that, selling Canadian oil at a $26/bbl discount and buying foreign oil at the premium world price for shipment by tanker.  Whose winning?

6223 2018-03-24 16:42:42 Well I'd be inclined to agree with you. Which is say is why the thrust of Corbyns shtick has been.  Fair wages. Investment in forgotten communities. Health. Education. Housing.  Ethical foreign policy. Etc. Easy to suggest he's all juniper oil and free range yogurt for all!
6224 2018-03-24 16:42:39 OTD in 1989 supertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska’s Prince William Sound & began leaking an estimated 11 Million gallons of crude oil. #saveOurPlanet #Sustainability #GoBeach
6225 2018-03-24 16:42:36 The best part about this Cambridge Analytica story is that it's shown that political campaigns are now just a giant monorail sale, where tech- illiterate billionaires are conned into spending millions on digital snake oil that can't ever be proven effective.
6226 2018-03-24 16:42:30 Geopolitics. I know. Oil isn‘t an exception. Like Iraq or now Syria. All cause of a pipeline from the Quatari basically. I just thought it was bad, backing up currency specifically with oil.
6227 2018-03-24 16:42:23 Now can anyone legally sell "any percent" of uranium, gold, oil, water, coal or government influence to another country or any company?  If you don't own it or have the rights to it, you can't sell it.   HILLARY!!

Hi can you plz post these two questions:
Is there anywhere in WA that I can get hold of cannabis oil for pain and also has anyone had any success with the daith peircing to help with migraines/tention headaches and anxiety? Thanx
6230 2018-03-24 16:42:15 the sun is beating down on me while i’m waiting for my oil change omfg i’m dying
6231 2018-03-24 16:42:06 Russia struck a deal with Saudi, just like it did with Turkey, they don't care much about Syria, they simply want the oil & gas contracts and the leverage, your well being is not top priority.
6232 2018-03-24 16:42:02 US nerviness from China stable economic advances and want to shake it in its favor by bullying EU. US, UK fake economies standing on engineered USD/GBP valuations by forcing OPEC to demand them for Oil contracts. Time to force OPEC to delink & abandon this unfair support of bully
6233 2018-03-24 16:42:01  We accept that governments work with private industry to ensure highways, seaway, ports, telecom and other infrastructure are in place for the good of the nation. 

We should demand that they also work to  ACTIVELY develop safe and environmentally sound oil infrastructure.
6234 2018-03-24 16:41:55 .... countries? I think less,  far far far less.  so let's be pragmatic about it folks and produce oil and sell it on the international market that originates from a country that is at least trying to limit damage to the environment.
6235 2018-03-24 16:41:55 As venal as our leaders are, coupled with porous boarders we have, these mercenaries can easily haul our oil to US. The gov't have sold us so cheap

6237 2018-03-24 16:41:47 I would only ever use olive oil. It works perfectly. And doesn’t taste at all. Lard would take longer to get to the type of heat required.

6240 2018-03-24 16:41:34 Wayne, you are spreading unreasoned hate, fear and lies. Kinder Morgan’s existing Transmountain Pipeline has delivered over 3 billion barrels of oil safely for 50 years, keeping our water safe and drinkable all along. You must be paid to spread you eco-terrorist ideology
6241 2018-03-24 16:41:19 Olive oil, tasty and good for you.
6242 2018-03-24 16:41:19 Got it as a stocking stuffer a couple years ago. It has been EVERYWHERE — in the engine compartment, wheel wells, oil changes. It has seen it all (so I can see.) Now if it would make it so I didn’t need reading glasses....
6243 2018-03-24 16:41:16 The left are proposing putting hot oil over top of doors in schools and then putting bag of feathers in each classroom........ this will get some traction 
6244 2018-03-24 16:41:09 And the next bubble could be from oil&gas. Once we go towards >50% clean energy production. And into transportation.
6245 2018-03-24 16:40:44 Hey Emma Your doing great But there is something that is making me feel so down It's the story of Alfie Dingley he has a very rare form of the illness that causes up to 150 seizures per month. He needs a cannabis oil licence in order to treat their son's rare medical condition.

6265 2018-03-24 16:38:29 didnt even know the march for our lives was going on til i sat down for my oil change, might as well take a listen to what they have to say
6266 2018-03-24 16:38:18 Thanks for the invite - Bald guy
6267 2018-03-24 16:38:03 Constant false narrative. The administration found that ATF did not have the right to regulate bump stocks. Please speak truth you snake oil salesmen.
6268 2018-03-24 16:38:02 Is the oil tap on or off yet? Personally keep taxing them. Let them pay for Ontario and Quebec!
6269 2018-03-24 16:38:01 New England has no pipelines, every gallon of gasoline, home heating oil, and associated products must be delivered by barge or ship at a cost to the consumer. The single nat gas pipeline cannot meet current demand. The consumer and the environment pay the cost.
6270 2018-03-24 16:37:44 This is a poor example of environmental protection: They are simply twinning where a pipeline already was, & pipelines are more environmentally friendly than trucking. Go after law makers to quit subsidizing big oil & to start legislating electric cars on our roads.
6271 2018-03-24 16:37:44 Snake oil ? Give us the details. Where are they ? Off the radar ?
6272 2018-03-24 16:37:43 @GirlTalkZA #GirlTalkZA Is there any cream or oil to remove Black Dark Marks? Please Help
6273 2018-03-24 16:37:43 @Aurika87916674  Hello, thanks for following me. I am Glenn Daniel, I live in United states. I am a oil drilling contractor. I work with offshore company in Orkney Island Scotland. I am divorced five years ago. I have no child. I will be very glad to hear from you again
6274 2018-03-24 16:37:29 Fun little tip because I happened to be out of lavender oil today, and burned the crap out of my hand....yellow mustard works just as well as lavender oil to soothe a burn! Definitely doesn’t smell as nice, but gets the job done!
6275 2018-03-24 16:37:20 More  $ to pay 4 gas at the pump when the United States exports the oil it produces. 

Trump wants the US 2 b independent & boost US jobs. Y  r  we not using the oil we produce? This, along w/ petrochemical bi-products ( ie diapers) derived frm oil, consumer costs will b lower.
6276 2018-03-24 16:37:12 I wonder if she put some oil down there because she didn’t rip at all 
6277 2018-03-24 16:37:03 oil is bad for the environment, unfortunately we still need it as technology is not quite there to replace it.  so given that we still need it where would these people rather see oil be produced? Nigeria?  venezuela? Iraq? is there more or less environmental regulation in these
6278 2018-03-24 16:37:03 That’s a two-spout oil flask. Guessing by the markings it’s Japanese, used to service rifles in the field. Could date back to WWII or earlier.
6279 2018-03-24 16:37:00 I heard him say his research was included in Cook's 97%.  That was incorrect.  The 97% stands.  The science is well-established.

We know most of the world’s remaining coal, oil and gas must remain in the ground. How to achieve this is a matter of political debate.
6280 2018-03-24 16:36:52 Without discovering Alberta oil, we would most likely still have farming and ranching as our #1 industry. Smaller pop. Expenses would obviously be much less.
6281 2018-03-24 16:36:40 1st of all do you know what good and healthy food is? Im talking spelt, rye flours, wild rice, chickpeas, things like hempseed oil, etc. They cost money, some of them need to be ordered outside Limpopo.

6298 2018-03-24 16:34:50 I wanna do something like BHO but instead of using butane I wanna extract the oil an all natural way other than pressing it. Anyone have any idea how to extract something without pressing it or blasting
6299 2018-03-24 16:34:48 Yes that's good but it's becoming not enough. We all really need to start refusing to buy single use plastic. Recycled bottles don't become bottles again, the plastic is downgraded. New plastic needed to make bottles, using oil - why fracking happens. We're killing the planet 
6300 2018-03-24 16:34:38 Top 20 winning mos. in Crude Oil produced an avg return of 14.6% … the same mos for the S&P 500 returned 2%
6301 2018-03-24 16:34:12 Ohh nice
6302 2018-03-24 16:34:00 Exactly. Last 10 yrs (especially 5 yrs) of interest rate absurdities created what appears as "growth", but in reality cancerous growth in so many industries. Oil/energy is a big one.

Slight exaggeration. But basically.

6312 2018-03-24 16:33:03 There's definitely ways and means of making it all good to eat. Avoid over cooking, steam it, add butter, make sure it's good and fresh to start with. A good salad can be amazing - beautiful ripe tomatoes, olives, feta or tuna, crisp salad leaves, watercress, oil and vinegar!!

6333 2018-03-24 16:29:24 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
6334 2018-03-24 16:29:16 I have oil on my hands but i don't remember wrenching on anything
6335 2018-03-24 16:28:59 201xは佐竹家とともに次の火曜日に実装予定だ！
6336 2018-03-24 16:28:35 البته بهترین، canola oil است.
6337 2018-03-24 16:28:34 Time to decriminalise so that this fossil fuel beating miraculous treatment, pesticide free resilient crop proving oil, fiber, and essential aminos can be grown and sold in a safe, legal, competitive and responsible manner.

6340 2018-03-24 16:28:22 Thanks for featuring the leopard cat! Detections in oil palm plantations tend to be higher than in forest probably because they use it as a rat buffet. They seems to prosper there, but unfortunately not for many other species.
6341 2018-03-24 16:28:16 Snake oil lying criminal occupying our house, the People’s house, going down in swirl of fire and gasoline of his own making
6342 2018-03-24 16:28:13 Silly, oil is supposed to be in the car
6343 2018-03-24 16:28:01 It's true- The smoke gives me migraines and edibles will but me down for a good day and a half. If someone is making oil I can't be in the room wihout getting nauseous. Never used to be that way, but it is now  Still believe in legalization though!
6344 2018-03-24 16:27:56 The skin has glands that do smaller and equally important jobs. Now there are glands called SEBACEOUS glands these  glands secrete oil to lubricate. Glands called SUDORIFEROUS secrete sweat, these ones are acting as a cooling system. 
6345 2018-03-24 16:27:42 でもやっぱループだったんじゃねぇか
6346 2018-03-24 16:27:40 Put a little fish oil in her food
6347 2018-03-24 16:27:33 Folks, here’s a man that has no idea that a line-item is unconstitutional. Why would you ever believe his “history lessons”? His whole career is lies, he’s a snake oil salesman.
6348 2018-03-24 16:27:32 Supposedly oil bought by gold? Or so the rumors go...We will have to wait and see how it works..
6349 2018-03-24 16:27:21 นึกว่าจะไป ธนาคารกรุงศรี
6350 2018-03-24 16:27:10 Rub oil and massage it and hit it from the back.
6351 2018-03-24 16:27:03 How long does it take to do an oil change??? I’ve been here for over an hour and I’m the only customer they have 
6352 2018-03-24 16:27:01 Argan oil works pretty good too i used that for a while when i was sick of all my products... it’s lightweight & it adds nice shine
6353 2018-03-24 16:26:52 二期決定！？信じていいの！？
6354 2018-03-24 16:26:44 I swear to god if you’ve never smothered yourself in baby oil while you’re still wet/damp after a shower/bath you’re seriously missing out
6355 2018-03-24 16:26:40 Retweet this and I’ll do an oil painting of you and put it on display in the National Portrait Gallery
6356 2018-03-24 16:26:27 US oil meme is pretty funny
6357 2018-03-24 16:26:27 Wish Nov 6 were tomorrow. President Snake Oil Salesman will find a way to detract, lie, and possibly have us in war to, again, bamboozle the crowd who voted for him by the time it rolls around
6358 2018-03-24 16:26:18 I can tell u from personal experience energy company CEOs r horrible at predicting future oil prices.
6359 2018-03-24 16:25:52 My dipbrow is getting dry and usually I would add a bit of baby oil but I had none.... so I added a pin drop of lube.... and it works even better than baby oil... groundbreaking
6360 2018-03-24 16:25:45 I need to get my oil change 
6361 2018-03-24 16:25:24 okay so I just stretched my septum from 12g to 10g. I opted to use emu oil and not lube. it hurt, but nothing too crazy. I was profusely sweating all over my body, though. I couldn’t stop sneezing for about 10 minutes and now I am congested. it’s sore.

but ‘twas worth it
6362 2018-03-24 16:25:11 People always trust the snake oil salesperson! They always sound so honest
6363 2018-03-24 16:25:09 About to oil up and put the Hush in, get ready to fuck as many loads out of me as you can!
6364 2018-03-24 16:25:02 流れ変わったぁ！
6365 2018-03-24 16:25:01 In Prince William Sound in Alaska, the Exxon Valdez spills 240,000 barrels (38,000 m3) of crude oil after running aground.1989
US taxpayers still paying for that.
6366 2018-03-24 16:24:50 Waiting for Becky to get her oil changed. Making sure she is A1 for her trip to Panama. These clowns said about 2 hours. Fml
6367 2018-03-24 16:24:45 Nowadays doctors control depression with drugs: serotonin inhibitors. But the ancient Greeks also relied on drug treatment: extracts from the poppy and mandrake plants, hypericum oil, a diet of milk and barley gruel, baths and massages, and music; the point is classical treatment
6368 2018-03-24 16:24:45 Me oil
6369 2018-03-24 16:24:43 CBD oil does NOT control ALL pain I am all for legalization but please do not give false hope to everyone when we know it does not work on ALL pain! #WER1
6370 2018-03-24 16:24:36 Records from UK show Bush-Cheney-Boulton Iraq war was always about US-UK oil firms getting hands on Iraq oil, just like @realDonaldTrump incited his administration plans to do. @nikkihaley @SenJoniErnst @SenDuckworth hearings
6371 2018-03-24 16:24:25 3. tons of blotting papers that can soak up excess oil and get rid of shine.
4. water based moisturizer thats non-comedogenic & oil-free. combo skin(lighter moisturizer on T-zone & thicker formula on the rest of ur face
5. Prime Time- mattifying gel/cream on ur T-zone
6372 2018-03-24 16:24:14 Ah...I think like 65% of country is aware that Trump is a con man with no true ideology...and we've been trying to communicate that to people who, for whatever reason, can't see him for what he is. A snake-oil-salesman-sham. Welcome to reality...glad you've joined us here! 
6373 2018-03-24 16:24:07 do you stock  oil burners?
6374 2018-03-24 16:24:02 1. Look for cleansers formulated for oily skin & use a gentle exfoliator (Avoid using alcohol based cleansers & limit washing your face with a gentle cleanser 2X per day
2. Clarifying masks can help deep clean pores & absorb excess oil. Look for clay or tea tree oil masks
6375 2018-03-24 16:23:43 good to know -  Hope you feel better soon.   If you rub them down with oil would that prevent rust?  Just wondering - in case I need to do that

6380 2018-03-24 16:22:43 are we talking asset backed with chinese oil?  sounds like a winner to me, if so.
6381 2018-03-24 16:22:40 An oil joke. I love it XD
6382 2018-03-24 16:22:32 Wow is the greed really that hard to see. Oil companies brag $300 BILLION in pure profit in a year. I spent most of my life in the auto body field $95 an hour labor rate total cost including material $30 at most
6383 2018-03-24 16:22:25 Glad I checked my receipt before I left. @pepboysauto put the wrong kind of oil in after an oil change. 
6384 2018-03-24 16:22:14 When you want to dress up and get slicker than a pile of oil but you don’t have no where to go.

6394 2018-03-24 16:21:10 I’ve done my morning skincare and got straight up to make my coffee.
That’s about how long it takes my nose to become an absolute oil slick. By the time I sat down to drink it my specs were sliding down
6395 2018-03-24 16:21:08 ハムあかん

6398 2018-03-24 16:20:59 #Lesson10 so between Trucks/Rail of Pipelines as a method of oil transport its hard to voice an opinion as to which is the least bad. Although the first has more incidents per year these are of much smaller volume than for the latter.
6399 2018-03-24 16:20:55 @MelissaRycroft Hey melissa, what's up, I saw your mom, there's a big nasty old school oil rig Extortion out in Kennedale, Call Len Robert and stay home, Call Irene (817)465-7390 IDK, it might be Anna's fault for not staying put in immigration

6403 2018-03-24 16:20:16 The best exfoliant you will ever use:

Your face will feel like a baby's butt
6404 2018-03-24 16:20:05 i wish you could crawl under them too fix things like oil filters and change oil. someone needs to take a the fixtures and feels of a classic and incorporate it in a modern   bring back real wood,thick steel bumpers, steel bodys. but with modern safety fixtures.
6405 2018-03-24 16:19:55 Oregano oil is good stuff!

6407 2018-03-24 16:19:47 How about we ask them for forgiveness for sending them to die for profits and oil???
6408 2018-03-24 16:19:46 @KM_Canada 
 1. Are you an American (ie .. foreign) company and 2. ... is the oil that will be shipped in your new pipeline to Vancouver being shipped out of Canada  to overseas?  In other words not staying Canada or being used by Canadians.  ??
6409 2018-03-24 16:19:41 And who is responsible for this? Greedy #Plastic lobby? Selfish #Oil producing countries? Ignorant consumers and governments? Will we ever recover from this Damage!!
6410 2018-03-24 16:19:33 The one time I got an oil change outside of the Lexus dealership my car was moving wild so now I'm stuck doing it at the Lexus dealership.

6413 2018-03-24 16:19:02 TBS again overpriced, I want to see Indian companies, with medium range price and less fluff, capitalize on these indigenous exotic oils. Hemp oil should also be fairly easy to extract in India. The cosmetics sector is booming, great potential for small and medium businesses.
6414 2018-03-24 16:19:00 use tea tree oil helps s the blowout just dilute it or else it burns like a bisshhhhh besos 
6415 2018-03-24 16:18:51 Ab budgets have relied on oil royalties, since the the first major discoveries in the 1940's. Maybe it's time to diversify; find alternative revenue streams ?
6416 2018-03-24 16:18:37 Tried to clean the deep frier I bought and it seems like the oil tank's not even removable. I can lift it a tiny bit with the help of a knife but any further and I'll just kill my fingers.
6417 2018-03-24 16:18:36 California is now the 6th largest economy in the world. We also have a budget surplus. And really cool beaches with no offshore oil drilling. 

Also, Disneyland. Who can be against Disneyland?

6419 2018-03-24 16:18:29 7. apply a mask with clay/salicylic acid-temporarily decrease oil production

9. If u use cream, switch to lotion,if u use lotion, switch to a hydrating serum-contains oil-zapping salicylic/ glycolic acid, pore-shrinking caffeine/anti-inflammatory niacinamide

6423 2018-03-24 16:18:00 I say let’s give Trump some of his own. Impose a 20% export tax on any oil flowing into the USA. Heck, any resources going to the US. If he doesn’t want to do business with us, we’ll find others who will
6424 2018-03-24 16:17:57 5. Limit ur drink & eat spicy foods no more than once a week-carrots,cantaloupe & spinach are high in vitamin A can actually slow oil production
6. Moisturize-"People confuse oil with hydration, so they dont properly hydrate skin. hyaluronic acid (help balance oil & water in skin
6425 2018-03-24 16:17:56 Ha ha abha that’s T5 mate mines a T6 and in the FUCKING GARAGE with a small oil leak at the minute I won’t show you what I’m running around in
6426 2018-03-24 16:17:51 Dog spit can not be defeated.  I always add some to Quaker State when I do an oil change.

6428 2018-03-24 16:17:47 Didn't we chop it all down before the oil arrived?
6429 2018-03-24 16:17:38 Ma, if your mcm can’t change a tire, check his oil nor take care of his car...you’re probably lesbian

6433 2018-03-24 16:17:12 Bio oil is a miracle worker omg and biafine is great as well but I think you can only get that at french health stores
6434 2018-03-24 16:17:03 1. Use a Cleanser with 2% Salicylic Acid-break down oil in the pores but isn't overdrying
2. Try tinted moisturizer with silicone, like BB Crème- forms a shield over the skin, keeping makeup in tact
3. Exfoliate Once a Week
4. Sunscreen
6435 2018-03-24 16:17:02 @TheRealRoosterM Can you give us an update about the guy who pitched the Guns and Oil beer from the old show?  Did it work out?  Tried the beer, actually not that bad
6436 2018-03-24 16:16:55 Enige tijd terug schreven we:, We gaan short op crude oil wanneer we 67.50 aantikken, Het leek niet meer te kunnen, maar beeld geeft nu misschien maandag/dinsdag al aanleiding voor short gaan.

6438 2018-03-24 16:16:32 Last night, when I dropped a paper-thin, hand painted Italian dinner plate piled with food, and it splintered into a bjillion pieces that were instantly coated with oil and sauce and wonderfully fragrant meaty bits, the dog didn't eat any of it before I could clean it up.

When making wage demands Joe Blow looks backwards at higher costs, not forward to future prices. Energy (esp oil) is the only hard objective cost

6446 2018-03-24 16:16:09 There are always consequences usually Murphy’s law when it comes to toppling dictators. They weren’t doing it for the Libiyan people, they were doing it for frances access to a their oil and Ghadaffis gold reserves it’s all documented in classified leaked memos.

6449 2018-03-24 16:15:34 Im literally making this for an oil change + car wash.
6450 2018-03-24 16:15:31 plus the fact I want to put a moat next to the wall filled with crocodiles. This will help the southern economy (my confederate base). We could fill the moat with burning oil, thereby helping my oil fracking friends. So much to destroy and dismantle. Wish I could build something!
6451 2018-03-24 16:15:28 With all that profit and big savings in Corporate Tax Rates, perhaps Now, someone will tell the BIG OIL Industry to stop gouging the American consumers and Lower All Fuel Prices at the pump and home heating! Still charging $3.00 and up per gallon.

6459 2018-03-24 16:14:50 Exactly. Which is why oil will be vital for a few more decades. Eventually, will go the way of whale oil.
6460 2018-03-24 16:14:48 well, Andhra doesn't need others money, it just needs its money . Instead of asking for center's help why don't you ask it's share on oil, gas and other taxes center collects from Andhra people?

6470 2018-03-24 16:13:16 Getting my oil changed and they have Pitch Perfect on the tv so I’m okay with sitting here for a while.
6471 2018-03-24 16:13:09 There’s something so intoxicating about the smell of metal and oil that comes with a newly opened panavise 350. Hello friend, let’s pick some locks together. 
6472 2018-03-24 16:13:05 I can’t wait to get married and send my husband off to get my oil changes smh.
6473 2018-03-24 16:13:01 Just bio oil? I've heard it works good but never met someone that uses it
6474 2018-03-24 16:12:59 If you struggle with #depression (or aches and pains!) and have never tried CDB oil…. Try CBD oil!!… Expensive but worth it… Turns your day around
6475 2018-03-24 16:12:57 It’s oil ~
6476 2018-03-24 16:12:56 But oil tho
6477 2018-03-24 16:12:48 Support Sveriges Television is provided by The End Censorship Conservancy, whose main concern is to fund big oil.
6478 2018-03-24 16:12:46 Sobrang lupet ng nakaimbento ng efficascent oil.
6479 2018-03-24 16:12:39 Most people who use the term tar sands are ignorant hippies or paid protesters who are full of hate and hypocrisy. But to your point, both tar sands and oil sands aren't accurate names since it's made up of sand, water, clay and bitumen. No tar. At all.
6480 2018-03-24 16:12:24 :o
Does rosehip oil mixed with vco count? because I've been using that to get rid of dark spots. It's looking good for now
6481 2018-03-24 16:12:21 Most of the pdvsa workers that I know are just working for the health insurance... Pdvsa remains one of the few companies in Vzla that gives health insurance for parents. Not so long ago it used to be a common practice in the private oil sector.
6482 2018-03-24 16:12:18 Oil change an car wash start ya Saturday off rite
6483 2018-03-24 16:12:17 Stir frying, sautė, there's no problem. You just can't deep fry with it because the food takes on an almost rancid taste and smell. So, canola oil goes in my deep fryer, because jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks are a thing.
6484 2018-03-24 16:12:11 Oml valvoline quick af with the oil changes

6491 2018-03-24 16:11:34 Do you ever question the purity of olive oil in these products? I avoid industrial seed oils like the plague and worry many "olive oils" are heavily cut with pro-inflammatory veggie oil.
6492 2018-03-24 16:11:33 God dammit my new beard oil smells amazing. Imagine the smell of 2 bearded unicorns fucking while the red white and blue flies above them proudly, and the national anthem plays in the background. And cannons firing simultaneously. That's the smell.
6493 2018-03-24 16:11:32 Wonder if they gone trip if I smoke while they change my oil 
6494 2018-03-24 16:11:31 What are the best all natural products to buy, so I can be healthy AF?
Like the toothpaste without the fluoride that's trying to kill my third eye
Which are best skin moisturizers? I usually bang with almond oil?
Where can I get a bulk/pack of black soap?
I use black seed oil.
6495 2018-03-24 16:11:26 From all cleansing oil cleansing balm anything that can be used as double cleansing

Heimish All Clean Balm is the God Tier. Even better than Banila Co.

6502 2018-03-24 16:10:15 Wow, @LelandVittert Right to the "Where are these kids getting money from". How about you ask that of POLITICIANS? How much they get from the Kochs? The Mercers? Pharma? NRA? Oil & gas?  Those kids are trying to effect change for the greater good. Politicians? Enrich themselves.
6503 2018-03-24 16:10:15 I need to get raw coconut oil, Witch Hazel, charcoal clearing cleanser and Aloe Vera. I need my skin flawless 
6504 2018-03-24 16:10:12 Oil Companies Admit Climate Change Is Real, Say Don’t Blame Us! I agree! Sure, the minute amount of Greenhouse gasses we expel into the atmosphere Can't "help" but compared to the Volcano's both Under/Over Water it is "MINUTE"!!!
6505 2018-03-24 16:10:09 #OnThisDayinHistory in 1989 one of the worst oil spills in U.S. territory began when the supertanker Exxon Valdez, owned and operated by the Exxon Corporation, ran aground on a reef in Prince William Sound in southern Alaska.

6507 2018-03-24 16:10:07 Ofcoz but my point is, the west are the ones who sponsors rebels in africa from Sierra leon to DRC. They always benefit from conflicts remember the gulf war? It was about the oil nothing more

6514 2018-03-24 16:09:20 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
6515 2018-03-24 16:09:17 Okay I will be over soon as I get done getting my brakes and oil change done.
6516 2018-03-24 16:09:15 Accidently used an excessive amount of beard oil cuz the little top broke off and you can't waste that shit. The U.S. is about to invade this shit now #yesioilmybeard #FullSend
6517 2018-03-24 16:09:14 Omg I’m using bio oil I’ve been using it for nearly a week and I swear it’s working so well!x
6518 2018-03-24 16:09:08 It does. Money does not buy influence one to one, if it did Democrats would control every state. Also, Breitbart and other fascist sites collectively also have billions of dollars invested in them by oil tycoons and their ilk, while Hollywood budgets are completely unreliable.
6519 2018-03-24 16:09:06 I know people think I'm weird but do they know I'm "makes a paste of za'atar and olive oil and puts it on bagels" weird?

6522 2018-03-24 16:08:49 I love overcast humid days for photography in the woods. The colours are almost like an oil painting.
6523 2018-03-24 16:08:46 29 years ago today the Exxon Valdez oil spill wiped out...(1/2)
6524 2018-03-24 16:08:19 Did you know adding a drop of Frankincense Essential oil to your moisturizer helps with the signs of aging?!

6526 2018-03-24 16:08:06 Dems & Snowflakes drink from the toilet, that's how smart they are. Maybe Pelois has them thinking this is holy water & it will make everything easy in life. Those damn flakes and ultra liberals will believe any snake oil salesmen that comes along!

6530 2018-03-24 16:07:59 แหม ธรรมดาคนเล่นทวิตตกูก้เช่นกันน
6531 2018-03-24 16:07:52 I live alone, I’ve been working since I was 14, ages 14-22 I took a bus everywhere I went, I helped raise my aunt’s triplets for the first 9 years of their lives, I raised $100k for my rescue in 2014, and I’ve rescued 300+ dogs
But I CANNOT go get an oil change without my mom
6532 2018-03-24 16:07:36 I think cannabis oil seems like an effective anti-inflammatory/palliative. Definitely seems to help many people control symptoms.
6533 2018-03-24 16:07:27 sahajan ritual oil and eucalyptus 
6534 2018-03-24 16:07:05 The oil again, they were happy to have us on board for well over 270 years before it was discovered.

Beige being dull, boring and predictable as usual.
6535 2018-03-24 16:07:00 I have a solid 2 hours to be productive while I wait for my oil to be changed but School of Rock is on and I have priorities
6536 2018-03-24 16:06:55 Yes we must get our oil from ethical regimes like Saudi Arabia
6537 2018-03-24 16:06:49 Morning Errands: Car Wash, Oil Change, Nail Shop, Etc...

6539 2018-03-24 16:06:45 If that's not just lip service then why did he sign the first one....what was that thing Jack Bauer said about crossing lines...something about once you cross the first it makes it easier to cross the second
6540 2018-03-24 16:06:34 I'm not so sure he believes or wants this, but more or less is taking the same approach oil and gas companies are taking towards green house gas emissions with carbon taxation.
6541 2018-03-24 16:06:29 You do know the protest is not about immediately cutting off all oil & gas, don't you?
6542 2018-03-24 16:06:27 FGO!?!?!?いやソシャゲか
6543 2018-03-24 16:06:14 TREY do the baby oil prank on ar’mon !!!!!! like y’all did on jazz when she fell in the the bathroom and y’all started whooping herbut on ar’mon

6547 2018-03-24 16:05:45 50 degrees today let me get my tanning oil ready
6548 2018-03-24 16:05:44 This pipeline protest is about protecting the waters as Kinder Morgan's product is to be shipped.  It doesn't hurt to know what the situation is about.
The Greens are not opposed to all oil & gas, their choice is to refine bitumen here - but companies prefer export.  As do Cons.
6549 2018-03-24 16:05:36 I'm hot like bad weather, I call her olive oil. Young Weezle.
6550 2018-03-24 16:05:33 Was it made of an oil based, man made material?
6551 2018-03-24 16:05:29 Exactly. So support the pipeline and get oil off the rail lines.
6552 2018-03-24 16:05:28 Oil change for Bambi
6553 2018-03-24 16:05:26 While the indy folk get rightfully angry about North Sea Oil theft it REALLY needs to clue up soon that OIL is KINDA running oot - but not in the manner MSM , BBC and Westminster portrays.

The removing of the combustion engine is that countdown , its 2035 for Peak OIL.
6554 2018-03-24 16:05:21 U need rick simson oil utube it
6555 2018-03-24 16:05:15 Wish my MP was as brave. Thank you for supporting BCs economy and environment which depend on clean oil free oceans

6557 2018-03-24 16:05:00 High oil prices could turn the US into a net exporter, which would be good.
6558 2018-03-24 16:04:54 Or an economic decision. Saddam began selling oil for euros,not just US petro$
6559 2018-03-24 16:04:47 Apple code vinegar and baking soda paste. Also try aloe (fresh) and tea tree oil.
6560 2018-03-24 16:04:47 mango seed oil from India is in the body shop's range. Kokum butter is fairly untapped, though have seen it in the Forest Essentials range. Hemp oil is everything for my skin.
6561 2018-03-24 16:04:43 どこから突っ込んで良いか分からないですが、えうびんは魔神味が凄過ぎて誰も勝てない気がします。命の灯火と共に光るスキンが最高です笑
修正版の方がひわいに見えるのはうちだけでしょうか…？
6562 2018-03-24 16:04:38 Girl some of that looked amazing! Key to the ice cream: hot oil, in and out. It should be dropped in and instantly taken out.
6563 2018-03-24 16:04:00 I remember drinking Old Engine Oil as a teenager back in the 90s. Lovely stuff. Gunnamatta is a fave of mine.
6564 2018-03-24 16:03:52 First and foremost today, #GoAvsGo!!! But also come on Jackets, Oil, and Preds!
6565 2018-03-24 16:03:50 the rest of the world is not "moving beyond" fossil fuels. That's the kool-aid US oil companies are feeding greens in BC. You can either keep drinking it or take a sip from @FairQuestions. Your choice.

6572 2018-03-24 16:02:45 Mr. President, Gogol & Pushkin should be mandatory reading. Russia is to irony what Saudi Arabia is to crude oil.
6573 2018-03-24 16:02:41 a few weeks into putting a daily swipe of essential oil in my nostrils, my allergies are totally gone

6576 2018-03-24 16:02:30 The Nazis plan to take over Europe using Muslim oil and Power 1933
6577 2018-03-24 16:02:25 Due to self funding (for years) the build of a foundation & business that can support it while we reach out for our short term donor loan, linguini with fresh garlic, olive oil, crushed red pepper & Parmesan made at home is a delicious pasta fix.
6578 2018-03-24 16:02:24 Owning a car is all fun & games until you have to get an oil change, new tires, etc.
6579 2018-03-24 16:02:22 Olive oil would be my pick from those options. Good chocolate and booze you can get here.
6580 2018-03-24 16:02:19 @pizzahut where has the flavoured oil gone from the salad bar? Is this permanent? 
6581 2018-03-24 16:02:10 In a few years we will be the #1 exporter of oil. Should give us lots of money.

6583 2018-03-24 16:02:00 Have you ever been so tired that you put your sons probiotic drops in his oil diffuser? No? Well I HAVE!!! and left it on all night, not realizing until the morning. #motheroftheyear

6587 2018-03-24 16:01:40 Allow yourself plenty of time to get to the Fieldhouse tonight. Super motocross event also occurring at Lucas Oil Stadium tonight to consider for your parking options.
6588 2018-03-24 16:01:37 Because I suppose John McCain, Marco Rubio, or more accurately Hillary Clinton's going to increase domestic oil production, coal production and exports to reduce our allies (like Ukraine)'s dependence on Russia, increase our military funding by $700 bil, and appoint Gorsuch? No
6589 2018-03-24 16:01:36 Vitamin e (capsules), aloe Vera (plant) and cocoa nut oil in a mason jar now watch me glow

6594 2018-03-24 16:01:11 This reminds me a statement given by Ghulam Ishaq Khan then FM in Zia up Haq regime in his budget speech, that to pass the benefit of reduction of oil prices to Awam is not in the interest of Nation.
Yes then n now all leaders consider people as fool of highest order.
6595 2018-03-24 16:01:08 3/24: Beginning of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound (1989), which showed why oil shipping is a threat to the environment.

6609 2018-03-24 15:59:57 The Rockefeller family made billions destroying our earth with oil and gas pollution and by stopping alternative energies by bribing politicians.  The people of the world should demand the Rockefeller family forfeit all of their money.  Nothing less!

6612 2018-03-24 15:59:35 Last night felt like a dream. My Uber driver back home was this oil painter, artist that spoke to me about real life and the importance of JUST BEEING. We though we were going crazy on how much we connected.

6615 2018-03-24 15:59:13 My face is so matte, I really have to get better at masking it just makes my oil control products work so well
6616 2018-03-24 15:59:12 The same with oil and gas. To me, these should not be privatized either.
6617 2018-03-24 15:59:10 I was expecting this move by U.S.A government from day one when our peaceful  beloved Ghana discover the oil in the land..and the next thing will be forcing our own people to fight each other so that they can get advantage of stealing the oil..#OilHunters
6618 2018-03-24 15:58:57 エレンのこの装備着ても負けてない存在感と背景の煩さ堪んないです!!笑
えうびんは誰かさんに似てるなーどうかなーアーッ！
生きよ、そなたは美しい…って思わず言ってしまいそうになりますね…
6619 2018-03-24 15:58:50 i should learn how to do a oil change
6620 2018-03-24 15:58:49 Hot oil
6621 2018-03-24 15:58:49 I saw a report that US is by far the largest producer and exporter of soy oil and meal and over past few years, China’s demand has shown no restraint, meaning their demand is meeting and would exceed our production. They cannot maintain their need from others for long duration
6622 2018-03-24 15:58:42 Thank you. That sounds promising.  To get THC-containing oil is impossible though. And regular hemp oil doesn't do the trick, right?
6623 2018-03-24 15:58:39 I need to go get my oil changed before i blow the bu up 
6624 2018-03-24 15:58:37 Precisely especially since oil is good at cancelling but I just got a tweet from them saying if you do preorder them you get a full refund for the money you spend on them by not the entry ticket as that’s not guest specific
6625 2018-03-24 15:58:21 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
6626 2018-03-24 15:58:18 The upsell game at the Oil change joint is strong.
6627 2018-03-24 15:58:09 When I tell my dad that the oil you put on the lawnmower is not the same as the one for the tractor and he pulls the en Cuba hay Un solo aceite pa todo échale ese mismo Lmaoo
6628 2018-03-24 15:57:57 Thanks :)
6629 2018-03-24 15:57:49 when you have a car from 2002... it’s never just an oil change  but I am lucky to have wheels sooo can’t complain too much I guess 
6630 2018-03-24 15:57:44 I think it's Quebec and Ontario that got the best deal out of our oil with equalization payments!
6631 2018-03-24 15:57:43 Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.'”
6632 2018-03-24 15:57:41 Use roll on castor oil
6633 2018-03-24 15:57:23 I never considered my face as anything to preserve, until now when I just had hot oil splash on it and I screamed like a captured chicken.
6634 2018-03-24 15:57:22 5150 wraps hanging out at me nester Jam in Lucas oil suite
6635 2018-03-24 15:57:12 I am not oil bear or bull... I follow macro that has huge influence on crude and Mr. Bolton is about to reformat this Macro world
6636 2018-03-24 15:56:57 @HouseGOP pretty obvious you guys are peddling snake oil when you say you represent conservatives. Can't even gather on common ground. My guess is someone somewhere is pulling your chains with a secret dossier. Half you clowns SHOULD retire (aka be drained). Run along now.
6637 2018-03-24 15:56:53 They buy Cdn oil at 50% discount and sell theirs at full price - obviously business sense is not one of our strengths. Reminds me of the politician who joked that “we’ll lose a little on each sale but we’ll make it up in volume”
6638 2018-03-24 15:56:52 The pill looks a bit like a fish oil capsule.
6639 2018-03-24 15:56:42 I see. So you are suggesting that the thousands of men and women that work in the oil and gas industry should be retrained, and take a lower wage.
6640 2018-03-24 15:56:36 Hitting the salad bar? Avoid fruit salads, as they usually contain syrups or sugars. You also want to avoid bacon bits, cheese, croutons and most salads dressings. Use a small amount of oil and vinegar dressing.
6641 2018-03-24 15:56:35 Anoche le dije a un tipo que olía a tanning oil y me contestó “I can oil you up a little baby...” bye.
6642 2018-03-24 15:56:24 Better to have organic, Madagascan vanilla ice cream than a bunch of E numbers in oil masquerading as double choc chip. No one gets to guilt anyone into sex they don’t want to have. Enjoy whatever ice cream *you* like best.
6643 2018-03-24 15:56:19 Simple things like oil changes really could be less expensive than what they are
6644 2018-03-24 15:56:17 So I’m trying to kick my sugar addiction and just generally be healthier because I fell way off track. I just took cod liver oil and am currently drinking raw veggie juice with trace mineral drops and I think I can feel my third-eye opening 
6645 2018-03-24 15:56:12 Can I bring poundo yam or fufu? I also have enough palm oil and dried fish just in case.
6646 2018-03-24 15:56:12 I hate oil changes 
6647 2018-03-24 15:55:43 I’m going to stop at Starbucks for some breakfast and then go to Walmart and get my oil changed
6648 2018-03-24 15:55:39 “Climate change is happening. We think a broad-based carbon price is the right answer.” — Steve Williams, head of Suncor, Canada’s largest oil company, May 2015. I guess "Big Oil" stands with Trudeau too. #skpoli
6649 2018-03-24 15:55:35 This aloe vera gel, rose water, and peppermint oil concoction got my head feeling so damn heavenly.
6650 2018-03-24 15:55:32 How do you keep your floors and furniture oil paint free? I LOVE oils just can't handle the mess I make hehe #keeponpainting 
6651 2018-03-24 15:55:31 Who is "their". And pointing out one example of a non-America first policy does not make the whole policy disingenuous. Some of these things take time, considering the last administration was Iran First and the one before was Oil First. And the one before was Sex First.
6652 2018-03-24 15:55:26 We should start reaping the income from our oil exports.
6653 2018-03-24 15:55:24 Well from my history All three are birds of the same feather. They maybe in opposition now but are just by name otherwise their actions in the past fit in well with KANU. So Raila who is an snake oil merchant managed to give Nasa some lifeline which the three can't
6654 2018-03-24 15:55:16 They aren’t mixed, it’s separate olive oil used for different things
6655 2018-03-24 15:55:16 Never will I put coconut oil on my face 
6656 2018-03-24 15:55:10 Trump Trying To Get Oil From Mexico
6657 2018-03-24 15:54:57 Confused... in this "pipelines and increased oil production are great for climate change" bs backwards Orwellian world, are we supposed to turn all our light on for earth day(hour) or shut them all off ?
6658 2018-03-24 15:54:44 I am dreading the number of informed (uninformable?) rural Albertans who will vote for conservatives on promises to bring oil back, believing lies from the cons, and not realize that world oil markets are not driven by concerns in Alberta. Those markets are never going to revive.
6659 2018-03-24 15:54:34 Who the fuck uses palm oil for that?  I mean if you care about quality even a little...
6660 2018-03-24 15:54:32 Khedery's casual & revealing mistake is to conflate #Exxon, #Texas & interest in #crude & #oil products exports with the US. Understandable as it's profitable to his causes, perpetuates silly narratives & shows corporations are now considered not only "people" but "countries."
6661 2018-03-24 15:54:31 Eggplant is awesome! - If done right.
Cut the ends, slice it thin, salt the slices, wait 20 minutes then rub off the salt, spread a drip of oil on slices, bake them on charcoal or in oven, let cool, soak in sour-sweet sauce made of balsamico, oil, salt, garlic, herbs, a bit sugar
6662 2018-03-24 15:54:29 Yes, I realize this. But if we exchange the tax per dollar with another tax per litre the gov would not be so happy when the price per lire soars and they rake in more cash. They may then be inclined to look into oil company pricing practices.
6663 2018-03-24 15:54:14 We have reloaded eggs with prizes and this batch contains 2 - $10 gift certificates.  Spend $20 and draw an egg. *CBD oil not eligible*
6664 2018-03-24 15:54:10 ha ok la kalau mcm tu. Setel. Pastu cari pulak la benda lain. Cleansing oil. Toner. Sunscreen.
6665 2018-03-24 15:54:09 #explainyourfeverdreams @p_lauersdorf13 yelling at me in Japanese while wearing an eyepatch because we infiltrated a Moroccan Oil Tanker to save the dinosaurs and got caught.
6666 2018-03-24 15:54:05 Heimesh cleansing balm ! Takde mineral oil. Bezz 
6667 2018-03-24 15:54:03 I wouldn't be so sure, there is a lot of olive oil fraud. Read "Extra Virgin." I'll keep buying sardines in water.
6668 2018-03-24 15:54:01 I like heavy cream and coconut oil in mine.
6669 2018-03-24 15:53:53 Just whack it in the fridge mate. It's a bit of a ball ache trying to get a tablespoon of it, but nowhere near as bad as coconut oil (which is obviously not even kept in there with the ghee).

Thinking about it, CO's texture alone was reason enough to swap it out. Nightmare.
6670 2018-03-24 15:53:46 I guna Senka for now. But tu la still nak mencari brand yg lagi best. Senka ni okayokay saja. Your cleansing oil okay tak?
6671 2018-03-24 15:53:41 Fucking beard oil in my eye!!!! #Argh #Pain #Agony #Beard
6672 2018-03-24 15:53:31 Who’s advocating for denying pain control?

I don’t want greedy pharma companies and greedy doctors prescribing heavy opioids to children when CBD oil works just fine
6673 2018-03-24 15:53:27 えっ…めっちゃいいめっちゃ好きです…
モブリットが年相応な元気ある感じ大好きです
6674 2018-03-24 15:52:57 Haul grains and oil instead?
6675 2018-03-24 15:52:55 Witch hazel on your bumps or pure tea tree oil and i either lay a towel down or change my pillow case everyday. The oil from my hair stays on it. And honey mask when my face is dry or i want a little glow
6676 2018-03-24 15:52:50 Yes...checkout the list I posted esrlier... lots of oil and gas stocks
6677 2018-03-24 15:52:37 I wonder if the US government will create an oil/gold backed cryptocurrency in the foreseeable future. If it's set up properly it can be easily traceable, non-duplicable, etc. idk why they wouldn't
6678 2018-03-24 15:52:10 Works utk acne skin! Pernah guna teatree oil tu.  Letak dekat jerawat.  Dua tiga hari dia kecut!
6679 2018-03-24 15:52:01 @oilve_oil_ フォローありがとうございます…！光栄です…！
西木野くん、とてもかっこよかったです！！元の顔面偏差値が高く、ダンスの途中にみせる表情がたまらなく格好よかったです…！！とても素敵でした…！！
これからのステージも楽しみにしてます！！よろしくお願いします( *˙˙*)
6680 2018-03-24 15:51:10 Pixi!! I use their rose cream cleanser and jasmine oil blend. My skin had never been better feeling. My skin was so dry and irritated before.
6681 2018-03-24 15:51:05 You've got a tough job covering the bases for this snake oil salesman.  Calls himself a conservative and grows government 13% in thos tragic budget alone.

Joke.

But the joke is unfortunately on us.
6682 2018-03-24 15:50:59 It’s in my interest. And 10s of thousands of other Canadians employed in the oil industry - including 1000s of British Columbians who fly to Alberta to work each week.
6683 2018-03-24 15:50:34 Perhaps because the oil companies say if we didn't use the stuff there would be no problem, hence we are to blame, not the big oil companies. Sounds to me like a drug pusher's defense, or it's not guns, it's people. Do those who don't accept AGW just not want to be to blamed????
6684 2018-03-24 15:50:21 Olive oil, butter, carrots, onion, celery, shit tonne of beef, milk, white wine, tinned tomatoes, salt, pepper, cayenne, bay leave, dried oregano, dried thyme... Um, I think that's it.
6685 2018-03-24 15:50:12 All the oil ever burned would not fill caldera of lake Tahoe. Check it out numbers are available. Big amount one would think but zoom out and imagine it to burn in one,... 
Would be a small fart on scale of our planet. 
The GW histeria has many holes. Like the one that at...
6686 2018-03-24 15:49:51 Caster oil!
6687 2018-03-24 15:49:46 โลชั่นมันมี oil เป็นส่วนผสม อาจทำให้ถุงยางขาดง่าย ไม่แนะนำครับ
แต่ถ้าใช้คนเดียว...ก็เคยใช้ ฟินดี ผสมน้ำลายหน่อยๆจะมันมือมาก
6688 2018-03-24 15:49:45 I just did mine last week, O’Reillys was having a sale so got my oil and oil filter for like $30 out the door you should go see if they still got that deal going
6689 2018-03-24 15:49:40 “Welcome to Boobytraps 101. Please open your textbooks to chapter 2: oil slicks, marbles, and other tripping strategies”
6690 2018-03-24 15:49:29 Canada could also impose some export duties on it's own products that the U.S. desperately need.  Like oil, and softwood lumber needed to rebuild the ravaged houses after the wldfires and tropical storms; electricity exports.  It doesn't just have to be imposed on imports.
6691 2018-03-24 15:49:28 Memang tak dry skin. Tapi taknak guna  untuk. Oily skin nanti dia strip oils jadi ketat. So pakai yang hydrating jugak. Oil cleanser I pakai yang eversoft skinz youth recall wrne merah tu. You?
6692 2018-03-24 15:49:16 I don't deny that.

But also Erdogan is a thief: he looted Syria and is an oil smuggler for his family business profits. A war profiteer, he should stand trial, next to Netanyahu.

Many NATO PM's should be indicted before the International court, if truly just.
6693 2018-03-24 15:49:14 Simple cleansing oil

6728 2018-03-25 23:57:18 You should be thankful Saudi Arabia uses the petrol dollar- requiring all buy/sell of oil to be done in USD. Otherwise the dollar  would collapse and cause a whole lotta hurt; more than a bombed out city here and there.
6729 2018-03-25 23:56:44 I love love love love love love love tea tree oil 
6730 2018-03-25 23:56:31 Maxfield Parrish is one of my all time favorite artists.  Started out as in illustrator.  Had a very unique way of doing oil paintings.  His blue is often called Maxfield Parrish blue.

6736 2018-03-25 23:54:56 No matter how many ways attempts are made to align my interests with the oil barons- like through nationalism, or party, or elitism, or menace, my loyalties remain with the children.

And against the NRA.

6746 2018-03-25 23:52:24 do you think hannibal extracts oil from a human like a coconut and moisturizes with it at night
6747 2018-03-25 23:52:24 That's because they live in a make believe land, where nobody's car, truck, RV, boat, train or airplane use gas or oil and electricity comes from the little holes in the wall and it ain't nobody's business!

6753 2018-03-25 23:51:16 What's irrelevant is trying to compare an oil pipeline to a planned maintenance event for a civic sewage system.
6754 2018-03-25 23:51:09 Simple matter of luck. Small population, 5 million, export of over 2 million barrels of oil a day, plus massive amounts of gas.

6763 2018-03-25 23:49:07 Ed rubbed some oil onto Barbaras shoulders, slowly working on the tight muscles. He smiled and blushed when she let out a soft moan. "Feels good, I assume?"
6764 2018-03-25 23:48:57 Who she is doesn't matter. Why is he just giving her a hunk of dry bread? No butter ? Or a bowl of seasoned oil to dip it in?

6770 2018-03-25 23:47:51 ‘Shit happened’ because the CLP kicked and screamed and got funding and investment, not because a fucking magic snake oil salesman duped white van drivers into voting for him (twice, then fucked off because he could see where the wind was blowing).
6771 2018-03-25 23:47:51 Africa has the most natutal resources. Water, oil, gold, diamonds, minerals of all kinds and especially those used in technology chips, game, natural herbs and the best climate to support all this. His approach was to make African leaders reclaim control of all this.

6775 2018-03-25 23:47:08 The oil barons are cut off from their own children, without access. That much is evident. Their interest is that they want access to the children, that much is obvious.

6792 2018-03-25 23:44:27 Mine's really oily, too. :( I also use almond oil or jojoba oil at night to moisturize. The foaming cleansers were a little drying even for my oily skin! But it just took a little while for my skin to get used to it. They're really gentle cleansers.

6813 2018-03-25 23:41:36 Dude I almost texted you to tell you that the only thing this doesn’t apply to is Midnight Oil.
6814 2018-03-25 23:41:23 It fries stuff but in a healthier way... using air instead of oil. I cooked that steak and the asparagus in less than 20 mins.
6815 2018-03-25 23:41:19 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
6816 2018-03-25 23:41:08 Only those looking to seek favor with the Chinese gov't will use these contracts in a limited capacity. Vast majority of oil trade will be dollar denominated for the forseeable future.
6817 2018-03-25 23:40:53 YOU COULD HAVE MADE A CEREAL BOWL OUT OF PIECES OF CONCRETE AND VEGETABLE OIL AND HE'D STILL EAT IT

6821 2018-03-25 23:40:28 True dat. They still need to hide for a time. Viz, Obama's comment today sounding SO timely for the Left. Still the jokester and still the snake oil salesman. But no actual truth of their goals yet.

6823 2018-03-25 23:40:09 Yeah but they are different entities. For example Leonardo "Chinook" DiCaprio is not the same entity as an oil refinery in Texas.
6824 2018-03-25 23:40:02 None of the above - Chinese gov't has such a history of intervening in markets that traders/companies/countries utilizing oil futures won't want to use yuan denominated contracts b/c of the add'l risk it introduces into an already risky and volatile market

6841 2018-03-25 23:36:40 Nah the US gives you your weapons and SA sells them their oil. I hope you realize the West is playing the royals as (very wealthy) fools. Ask Iran what happens when you don’t sell us your oil.

6844 2018-03-25 23:36:08 "Military grade" is a slipshod marketing term alluding to a product built to a higher spec for durability, reliability or performance. It is recklessly applied to everything from mobile phones, kitchen cutlery, motor oil, camping gear, flashlights and ballpoint pens.

6846 2018-03-25 23:35:57 Dropping 80% of the red meat I'd eat and swapping it for chicken has led to reducing my uric acid by a whole 1mg and now i'm just normal-high rather than above the normal limit. 

I also switched to coconut oil for cooking.
6847 2018-03-25 23:35:53 my hair deserves a good deep condition and hot oil treatment
6848 2018-03-25 23:35:47 hypocrite--you sold out to big oil to drill Alaska-. Fyi--that will make climate change worse.
6849 2018-03-25 23:35:29 Canada starting putting asbestos in their floor tile exports to the US, and called it even.

Or, more accurately, Canada figured out how to process shale oil, and stopped bitching about the acid rain their exported oil caused.

6851 2018-03-25 23:34:52 If oil futures are not reacting its nothing
6852 2018-03-25 23:34:45 The oil is the blood of the Earth, if we drill it we kill the earth. We need an alternative fuel.

6866 2018-03-25 23:32:10 Carefull the US might give the oil some freedom
6867 2018-03-25 23:31:30 B/c if #ableg NDP Rachel said coal is out NOW, oil sands (TAR sands to enviros) should stay in ground, no more pipelines, we're going to magically transition to renewable green energy despite having no $ to fund & encourage it, that would be such a winner in AB, eh?
6868 2018-03-25 23:31:26 Cooking chicken on the stovetop in oil in a tank top was the worst idea I’ve had this year 
6869 2018-03-25 23:31:14 It fooled the oil market (for now). But re-watching the videos multiple times makes me support the theory that this was phony.

6893 2018-03-25 23:26:25 So far it doesn't look like the world is ending for the US. Oil is up some but /ES, /YG, /NQ don't look too bad at this time.  #petroyuan
6894 2018-03-25 23:26:14 Yes. Freedom will reign, and the pipeline will go through. The #Econuts, the #KookiSuzuki s should focus their efforts on real #environmental issues, instead of following the all mighty greenback, which is to rub out the competition to Foreign Oil. #EnergyIndependence
6895 2018-03-25 23:26:08 This will not make it mainstream..they know it is manufactured
6896 2018-03-25 23:25:57 If our education sector is fixed, everyone will suddenly start asking them how they got their oil blocks. I am sure they don't want to see their magomago so they are dictating the tune that diverts us away from the real problem.
6897 2018-03-25 23:25:42 So, mini-update on my situation. I’m finally getting full time hours but pay rate per hour is low. My furnace broke after I put $300 worth of oil in the tank so I’m out $300 and short on all this month’s bills.
6898 2018-03-25 23:25:16 did it wrong initially using olive oil, too low a heat for too short a time...just ended up with an oily pan. then becel, 400 for 30m x 3 last time. was a little sticky.
6899 2018-03-25 23:25:05 "She acknowledged that things may have changed in the more than 20 yrs since she left. “& I’m sure they have got better,” she said. Pointing to concerns about oil spills, particularly those involving dilbit, she added: “But the laws of nature & physics have not changed since ”

6901 2018-03-25 23:24:57 Mag pa chance oil pa and chuchu kapuya.
6902 2018-03-25 23:24:49 Still love her.....anyway.
6903 2018-03-25 23:24:45 I had a nice motorcycle at the end of the 80's, a Honda GB500. It was a retro homage to British sport bikes of the 50s. Of course, they couldn't get it right--never leaked a drop of oil.
6904 2018-03-25 23:24:40 Oh that's so cute when you talk about climate change like you cared. Have you sucked enough oil out of the ground? Have you cut enough old growth timber to bring the net CO2 concentration above 400 ppm? Then you've succeeded in the eyes of your trump friends.
6905 2018-03-25 23:24:29 Jiffy lube is whack as fuck. Used a coupon for $70 full oil change. Still charged me full price.

6909 2018-03-25 23:23:59 @Glenn__Kenny the rich oil dude - J. Paul Getty . did he hang around NYC in the 80's . u ever meet the super old dude ?
6910 2018-03-25 23:23:51 Completely agree. I do think that shale oil reserves post 2014 (super frac era) is something to watch close. More data on tight gas, which is simpler IMO and should not show as big of delta. Hanging EUR off IPs a dangerous game, many do it.
6911 2018-03-25 23:23:27 I’m buying an old brownstone right now. I wish there was some assistance from the city for oil tank removal/gas conversion.  Either a financial incentive or the city could partner with particular well vetted companies.  How about it?
6912 2018-03-25 23:23:26 It’s worse than we thought. But I’m happy the big oil companies acknowledge climate change is real. They can measure that created by big oil and want to hold those co. Responsible. Let’s get on with . How else will it ever stop? And those sea walls won’t build themselves.
6913 2018-03-25 23:21:51 Ok, so I now know I'll need to get an oil change on my mom's pickup before taking it to a friend's property, and fix the door on her house so that it can be secured, and get a temporary registration for the pickup to get it here.

6917 2018-03-25 23:21:36 Please.  No one is paying for oil with gold.

6920 2018-03-25 23:20:53 Sure honey. You do know all about these other accusers but you REFUSE to acknowledge them because you believe that that snake oil salesman is your massiah. Jesus would be sorely disappointed in you.
6921 2018-03-25 23:20:50 Thank you. The easy fix methods of the UCP are political snake oil. We do not need a return ton”Kleinism”

6925 2018-03-25 23:19:45 Trust me, it is very easy to defend yourself when you have an oil block..

Why are generals & elite, not asking for core things like....say:

RESTRUCTURING
Police/SARS Reforms
Judiciary Reforms 
Electoral Reforms
Repeal of LUA
Reduce Exclusive List
Decentralization of Education
6926 2018-03-25 23:19:44 Made a sauce of gochujang, soy, sriracha, and sesame oil, with some onion powder and garlic salt mixed in. Oh man it was good. Thank you for recognizing this momentous accomplishment of mine.
6927 2018-03-25 23:19:40 Heads up, Adern...we're pissed, and won't buy into your rhetoric. Ban ALL oil and gas permits now; rescind permits already given, and get on with the job of restoring NZ's tarnished (by 9 years of Nats) reputation. Thank you
6928 2018-03-25 23:19:37 @FatKidDeals cheap oil diffusers? Bought the one you listed the other day for $5.99. Need a few more but can't use the same coupon.

6937 2018-03-25 23:17:48 Good point. Let's wait and see how this is handled by our mediocre narrative repeating western media.
6938 2018-03-25 23:17:39 I wonder if it will end in a cream pie or facial? Either way I have a bottle of olive oil ready!
6939 2018-03-25 23:17:26 Well, I agree that Lebanese politicians tend to put more work and creativity into stealing public money, but that's mainly because it isn't delivered straight to their doorstep in the form of oil rent.

6948 2018-03-25 23:15:58 A few things I’ve been meaning to tweet but keep forgetting. 1- there’s literally maybe 40 water bottles in my car. 2- stop inviting my places so I don’t fly out anymore. 3- I lost my hair oil at temocs. 4- y’all some lil whores
6949 2018-03-25 23:15:57 I'd personall drizzle some olive oil on it, some salt and pepper and then bake it, adds a nice crunch to it, which I prefer.

6953 2018-03-25 23:15:11 Not in the absolute. Many diff kinds. An opinion piece is diff than just reporting objective facts, as is a piece presenting the subjective.

6965 2018-03-25 23:13:38 People don't realize that this is the same war against global Muslim expansion that's been going on for nearly 1500 years.  There was a hiatus after WW2 and the West fell into a state of denial because we wanted / needed the oil.  Time to fight back.

6974 2018-03-25 23:12:31 (2/2) And the timing of all this speaks volumes. Bolton getting in, and MBS in the U.S. He will be at MIT tomorrow. I hope he receives a protest there. But these seem like coincidences that are too hard to believe.

6982 2018-03-25 23:11:28 (1/2) There is a claim of an Egyptian citizen dead. My guess (so far) is that MBS wanted the Saudi defense system to make it look as if they were intercepting missiles, while having a few of them go haywire. They're not against killing their own citizens for their agendas.
6983 2018-03-25 23:11:21 Gotta be careful! Do a strand test first ! And make sure you’re ready hydrate and oil your scalp and hair. Bleaching and color will leave your head dry and it I’ll take a while before all the nutrients get back into it.

6991 2018-03-25 23:10:31 OIL BRENT US$67.73/bbl +1.8%. Geopolitical risk between Saudi Arabia and Iran over nuclear weapons bearing down on oil markets.

6999 2018-03-25 23:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

7001 2018-03-25 23:09:17 Q: why doesn’t Lucas make computers.

A: they couldn’t figure out how to make them leak oil all over your desk
7002 2018-03-25 23:09:10 Not sure of the oil amt. Don’t have the recipe in front of me but probably about 1/2 cup
7003 2018-03-25 23:08:58 I use coconut oil for body lotion, I personally don't like the olive oil for that too much. The Eucerin comes in both a thick, glob form and a more smooth lotion form.
7004 2018-03-25 23:08:47 It’s just regular cooking coconut oil! I massage it on my scalp and then with the left over on my hands I run through my ends. I sleep with it in overnight. I do it every Sunday! It’s seriously the best and my hair is a little thicker.
7005 2018-03-25 23:08:42 And gold turned down and oil dropped immediately. US futures dropped immediately. See how that works. Only t facts madam. Only t facts.
7006 2018-03-25 23:08:42 Ummm where’s Chicken Oil?!
7007 2018-03-25 23:08:30 I think InfoWars might be hocking snake oil mixed in with something something about globalists. Also, this is why I'm not allowed to go on vacation.
7008 2018-03-25 23:08:19 Also the recording of all the videos conincidentally happens from a perfect vantage point. hollywood production ..but not slick enough..but they need to show some dead bodies or vehicles or buildings blown up in the future to make it more convincing for oil to shoot up.:) #OOTT
7009 2018-03-25 23:08:06 Pour hot oil on them as they did, enough is enough.

7016 2018-03-25 23:06:45 We don't have president of the military we have a commander in chief who has only cost lives to guard his own oil interests.

7021 2018-03-25 23:05:55 Baby oil, coconut oil and baby soap work well too
7022 2018-03-25 23:05:47 World oil use has gone up every year for decades. Anti Oil Activists do not seem to realize they are an evolutionary dead end. If they actually followed their own advice they would not survive and if society listened to them we would all starve. We should give them #Darwinawards

7024 2018-03-25 23:05:44 oof this castor oil smells really good
7025 2018-03-25 23:05:39 Then bake for 20-25 minutes. Best seasoning mix is chicken soup powder, chilli flakes, dried thyme and a pinch of sugar and put it in an ice cream container with your potatoes and a bit of oil and shake. Then bake. Okay I’m done. Byee.
7026 2018-03-25 23:05:13 woman is literally scooping gob handfuls of oil and smearig it all over and u her friend who has just rolled over and opened up ...... allll very, very, very slick ... very slidey ........ would have to rolly stuff dry towel up there and twist to get any good dick action with her
7027 2018-03-25 23:04:57 If he didn't talk about how great the Sharks are (even when the Oil aren't playing them) would be a start.
7028 2018-03-25 23:04:32 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
7029 2018-03-25 23:04:32 Hmm, might give the Eucerin a try. I looked at some of the olive oil lotion but it looks like it might be... too greasy for my face? might be rly good for body lotion tho

7034 2018-03-25 23:03:11 Each government has its own pawns there, through the different communities (Ali Awhida Slimani GNA's deputy-MoD, LNA's Tebu Ali Sidi...). The Tebu won't give up because the've already lost the Kufra region so they'll fight for Murzuq Basin (oil fields, al-Wigh/Waw bases, borders)
7035 2018-03-25 23:02:50 My guess ... War would spark safety rush to UST's ... Enough to fund military in short term. After that? "To the victor, the spoils"  ... If oil supply 'breaks', oil gets expensive again, USD gets another few years of overvaluation.

Potatoes are good boiled partially first, then dry them off really well, in a bowl with oil and whatever dried herbs you like
7038 2018-03-25 23:02:37 I think we definitely need more advice, I only really started to look seriously at nutrition and health after finding out more about olive oil! And the food available in most hospitals could also be vastly improved!

7041 2018-03-25 23:02:31 So those who HATED pipelines and the oil and gas industries....forgot to join Earth Hour? Hmmm a bout of HYPOCRISY or amnesia????
7042 2018-03-25 23:02:27 Bruh I sent Brandon to Walmart to get me some sports bra’s and some coconut oil and this nigga acting like it’s rocket science..
7043 2018-03-25 23:02:20 Okay okay because the olive oil one does NOTHING for me lol
7044 2018-03-25 23:01:52 Then you'd know that UK is far and away Ireland’s biggest trading partner, accounting for 50% of exports from the Republic. Ireland is virtually entirely dependent upon the UK for energy, importing 90% of its oil and more than 90% of its gas from the UK.
7045 2018-03-25 23:01:41 Why would tonight be different from any other night?
7046 2018-03-25 23:01:37 Today i have learned about a Dutch Disease. The author used Nigeria’s oil as example.
7047 2018-03-25 23:01:27 We share a desk!! No wonder why it always smells like baby oil & there’s stains on the carpet!! #SpringCleaning cant come soon enough
7048 2018-03-25 23:01:24 I like the Argan oil one but the jbco & flaxseed oil one is really good also, it’s just of a looser consistency than both the argan oil & olive oil ones
7049 2018-03-25 23:01:20 Canada produces less from tar sands because extraction is very expensive and not worth it if oil prices are low. We produce more, they produce less, total is the same... then the Saudis tighten the spigot, and price goes up. No president can affect the market.
7050 2018-03-25 23:01:15 I can't believe it. I asked YouTube for "news live" and it gave me a gift: Alex Jones Live. I can't to buy snake oil.

7053 2018-03-25 23:00:59 Desarrollo de energías renovables, Colombia posee los recursos suficientes para dejar de depender del oil en menos de dos años
7054 2018-03-25 23:00:58 I think you’re due for an oil change 
7055 2018-03-25 23:00:54 My face is ultra sensitive and the only thing I've found I can use is Olive Oil lotion (like from the name brand Proclaim) and Eucerin. The latter I've used for years and it's the only thing I've found that doesn't upset acne asides from the Olive Oil.
7056 2018-03-25 23:00:47 Confusing propaganda and journalism. 
Common mistake by leftists.
7057 2018-03-25 23:00:45 I just rolled on some vanilla musk perfume oil and ohmy god... a bitch might just ditch her Chanel no5
7058 2018-03-25 23:00:45 Something about shaving every inch of your body , and then applying coconut oil to slide on silk sheets 
7059 2018-03-25 23:00:43 I need to get my brakes and good oil change before this trip  need to start packing too

7061 2018-03-25 23:00:26 Lots of stuff he says on broadcasts either makes me shake my head or roll my eyes.  I really enjoy Jack and Bob’s playcall - wouldn’t hate to hear them take a spin on an Oil broadcast.  Quinn’s classic, don’t get me wrong.
7062 2018-03-25 23:00:14 Coal isn't happening. Coal burning power plants were retrofitted at the cost of billions of dollars to move away from coal. Oil prices are set by a worldwide cartel. No relation with how much oil we produce.

7064 2018-03-25 23:00:01 Fast food restaurants reuse cooking oil over and over again. Each time it is reheated, it is thickened with toxins.
7065 2018-03-25 22:59:53 I hope the media and true journalists question and investigate any claims and videos that Saudi Arabia puts out there. The Saudi rulers have an agenda you know (they want the U.S. to invade Iran, and they want higher oil prices). Or will you just repeat their narratives?

7072 2018-03-25 22:58:44 No makeup remover? No worries! Grab extra virgin olive oil out of your kitchen! Olive oil is natural, moisturizing &amp; will remove makeup.
7073 2018-03-25 22:58:42 beyond annoyed @ men who condescendingly ask if i need help putting oil in my engine. do not assume im incompetent bc im a girl

7079 2018-03-25 22:57:15 Today I'm kicking off a month of my version of the potato diet. I'm going to try to only eat potatoes, any variety, and bananas. I'll use no oil. I'll probably be eating a lot of mashed potatoes with fat-free gravy. My goal is fat loss.
7080 2018-03-25 22:57:01 I can feel my castor oil staring at me despairingly when I fall asleep with my eye makeup on still
7081 2018-03-25 22:56:51 The eyeball at the top of the pyramid on money is actually a tiny camera! Most people actually have eleven toes, not ten! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
7082 2018-03-25 22:56:51 A man knows who his heart belongs to, so you can cook his food in diamond oil & do backflips on his dck.. but if it isn’t you, it isn’t you 
7083 2018-03-25 22:56:35 Most troubled part of the world--colonialized for oil.   One shining light--which has ignored more UN resolutions than Saddam did.
7084 2018-03-25 22:56:34 Maybe I have been wrong calling @SpeakerRyan a snake oil salesman. If all this is true then I truly apologize.  We'll see
7085 2018-03-25 22:56:21 Easy we have Connor. That’s enough said and especially since you guys have a huge fan base in Edmonton as with the Oil not making it in the playoffs we are cheering for Vegas. Love you guys and your amazing city.
7086 2018-03-25 22:56:20 @headdock have u read up on Rick Simpson CBD oil? I used it w/my kitty that had stage 4 metastatic cancer & it seemed to help in many ways. Vet gave her 2 weeks but I believe the use of supplements, RS oil & optimal nutrition extended her life to 3 months 
7087 2018-03-25 22:56:16 While this looks "posed" to me, the cats by the starboard engine could be preparing to "roll" it by hand. A common practice, I've associated with getting lube oil, up out of the sump & into the engine. There is short video, out there of a "platoon" of airmen "rolling" a B-36.
7088 2018-03-25 22:56:12 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

7093 2018-03-25 22:55:29 Which the children were coached to say.
7094 2018-03-25 22:55:29 Try some clove oil rubbed on the area. Then get to a dentist!

7104 2018-03-25 22:53:58 In all fairness - you guys took care of the problem and loaned me a car yesterday - Maxx was a true professional and took care of the problems. All told, a six hour ordeal for an oil change.
7105 2018-03-25 22:53:52 is this a joke??? you supported drilling for oil in ANWR! nobody's buying your concern for the climate.
7106 2018-03-25 22:53:51 used a little paprika powder, little condimetn packet of soy sauce, olive oil, splash of tapatio, garlic powder and ground pepper, mostly is ground pepper. My mom tried some and she really likes them  there a little spice at the end but not much
7107 2018-03-25 22:53:25 Don't fall for any tricks that #Trump #Bolton #MBS #SaudiArabia (and their media) try to pull. #Riyadh missile attacks may be phony attacks. MBS is dying for the U.S. to invade Iran, and he wants higher #oil prices too. Provoking an #IranWar achieves both. #NoWar #AntiWar #Peace

Ooooh...TY Danjuma's Tongue was licking the now drying Oil pipelines that has been bombed by ND Avengers abi?
7117 2018-03-25 22:51:43 Keep telling us in oil-bribed MSM all about the 'reformed' #KSA and the 'Conservative' new leader who has 'orgies' is not 'gang-bangs' his 30 wives.
Hypocrisy on principles and values when it comes to oil (or money) has no bounds in the West...

7118 2018-03-25 22:51:08 I remember when I tried to make chichurittos so I put oil in a pan and waited for it to get hot but I fell asleep & woke up to the alarm going off & the house Smokey boi I was panicking so much bc I didn’t know what to do 
7119 2018-03-25 22:51:01 Alternately, you can boil them a bit longer and bake them with fresh tomatoes, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar for a more stewy side.
7120 2018-03-25 22:51:01 Really difficult to get a chocolate bar without palm oil, tried today whilst doing the weekly shop but gave up.
7121 2018-03-25 22:50:48 I love coconut oil for cooking. That's about it for me.
7122 2018-03-25 22:50:46 Oil cleansing ? 
7123 2018-03-25 22:50:42 Is that all? Geez. We're top producer and we still have to steal more? Never enough $$$. Now never enough oil. I'm gonna hurl.
7124 2018-03-25 22:50:39 pretty sure the first advocates for disarming fucked up white militias were native people but you all really aren't listening to us so we'll just remember that history (oh and ongoing resistance to militarized oil companies) all by ourselves.
7125 2018-03-25 22:50:38 So can you point to any Greenpeace blockades going in the ever expanding USA oil production sites.....how about Saudi.  Didn’t think so. Bold....pfftt.  What a joke.
7126 2018-03-25 22:50:32 Depends on the oil markets this week I guess
7127 2018-03-25 22:50:24 That’s the fkn blow! Been there; Castor oil helps them grow faster :/
7128 2018-03-25 22:50:14 Top the fish with the breadcrumb mix, s&p, then bake for 10-15 minutes at 200 Celsius. For the taters, cut them into chunks about the size of your thumb folded up, parboil for a little bit, drain and toss vigorously with herbs and oil, then bake until crispy.

7136 2018-03-25 22:48:53 Look out the windshield if you can. Roll down a window so you get cool air. Dramamine and/or CBD oil.
7137 2018-03-25 22:48:50 Oil
7138 2018-03-25 22:48:49 Next time try a marinade with olive oil, rosemary, Worcestershire sauce, chili pepper flakes, and Greek salad dressing.
7139 2018-03-25 22:48:39 There’s no better correlation with ‘overpriced goods and Oil Price hikes’. If you want to talk about the interplay if demand and supply, fair for businesses that have had an impact and has a market niche for themselves. Not a new business. Even basic growth stages doesn’t allow.
7140 2018-03-25 22:48:18 Popcorn with butter is quivering at popcorn with olive oil and salt

7145 2018-03-25 22:47:43 My suggestion would be to mix lemon juice, olive oil, and smashed garlic in the bottom of a baking dish, then put the fish in, turning to coat it properly. Mix togetger the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, and a few tablespoons of olive oil, toss until the breadcrumbs are moist [cont]
7146 2018-03-25 22:47:37 God gives us beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness (see Isaiah 61: 3). God gives us whatever we need to be victorious. Because He enables us, we credit Him for all the good things in our lives.

7173 2018-03-25 22:43:56 I’d go run something like IMCA Modifieds or Sportmods. You’d pick it up really fast from your Lucas Oil experience. That or just get a sold Kart mate
7174 2018-03-25 22:43:48 Will have to look into this olive oil soap, sounds soothing.

7176 2018-03-25 22:43:10 Big oil, big pharma, big tobacco don’t encourage or condone mass-murder by disenfranchised, angry, entitled males.
7177 2018-03-25 22:43:01 Abortion production cracked me up too.  Likening it to oil or coal production
7178 2018-03-25 22:42:50 Sunday Riley Luna oil, the new tarte toner, a biossance spf, and philosophy cleanser
7179 2018-03-25 22:42:42 Hickory grilled pork chops, mashed potatoes, and green beans (preferably pan seared with olive oil, garlic, salt, and lemon)
7180 2018-03-25 22:42:37 Burning the midnight oil planning how to stop the oil.
7181 2018-03-25 22:42:37 Coconut oil normally takes it right off!
7182 2018-03-25 22:42:35 .@CNN are nothing but democratic activists! Infomercial for Democratic Party, bought and paid for by the NWO snake oil salesmen!
7183 2018-03-25 22:42:29 Likely rip up all the wind and solar contracts and start over. I'm surprised you allow Big Oil to steal your money this way

7186 2018-03-25 22:41:38 Lmfaoo Tori just FaceTime me.. the cooking oil’s top was off so it spilled all over her.. this bitch look like a lubricated marshmallow!! I’m yelling
7187 2018-03-25 22:41:34 Horrible. Wish someone would dip the parents in hot oil.
7188 2018-03-25 22:41:21 Baked to get bacon cooked, then thrown into a skillet of olive oil, butter, and roasted minced garlic. Then basted with that liquid while searing each side. Rest and serve!
7189 2018-03-25 22:40:31 What a good day! Went to Church, got my Palm, saw my church fam, was also reminded y I dnt go there like that. The new Pastor n his wife r fish oil salesmen. He rubs oil on us on New Years 
7190 2018-03-25 22:40:30 And another God damn thing what kind of f****** National Guard goes to Iraq sites so don't Hussain oh my fault too and then goes to a Goddamn Reserve I don't know what's the bastards to bring in a f****** oil pipeline who the f*** does that U backwards motherfukers
7191 2018-03-25 22:40:24 Have you been around some of the people in the oil patch? the job it’s self sucks the soul out of you. I respect what you’re saying but to say working on a rig is easier is ridiculous when you’ve never worked on a rig. never said being a nurse was easier, haven’t been a nurse.
7192 2018-03-25 22:40:23 Que meme excelente ese de que todo lo que tenga la palabra oil eeuu lo invade y despues viene una pelotuda con unas fotos suyas diciendo que es un meme
7193 2018-03-25 22:40:17 Coconut oil is a good mositurizer. You can use it like a mask or like aloe basically but make sure you only use a small amount bc otherwise yeah it can clog ur pores if you have oily skin
7194 2018-03-25 22:40:12 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
7195 2018-03-25 22:40:08 fjfkfjkd my eyebrow always has this annoying spot after someone plucked at it weird 3 years ago if this castor oil stuff doesn’t fix it I’m just gonna put a little slash in it it’s already halfway there anyway
7196 2018-03-25 22:39:51 Best oil I’ve ever used. Go for it
7197 2018-03-25 22:39:32 I already changed my oil in 2015
7198 2018-03-25 22:39:24 I want to vape pepperoni oil
7199 2018-03-25 22:39:09 Some detachement friday w a little panic. Still small doses but enough to drive gold/US opposite.  Waiting for selers to drop t metall as t thinking process pulls down sentiment. A little better alignement right now though as climbing gold again lifts oil & SPX futts.
7200 2018-03-25 22:39:08 What was the point in our natural resources? Clean coal...the keystone pipeline? Why are Americans not benefitting? Why are we drilling for oil here, but gas prices have not gone down? Same question with electric...we have all these resources, but where are they going???
7201 2018-03-25 22:38:42 Coconut oil is very overrated but I can't get to a hair store before Thursday so... yeah.
7202 2018-03-25 22:38:39 Went to pick up my car from NTB from getting an oil change & they had it 5 hours. & they’re closed. Didn’t receive a phone call & now I have no car.. all for an oil change 
7203 2018-03-25 22:38:27 coconut oil pa lang, cardiac na tayo 
7204 2018-03-25 22:38:22 Looks like I've been sleeping on tea tree oil.
7205 2018-03-25 22:38:14 I asked my mom where the vegetable oil was to make brownies. She told me that we didn’t have any and to use coconut oil. I said “oh okay, I will.”

I used a stick of butter
7206 2018-03-25 22:38:10 Grandma sent me money to get my oil changed and new  windshield wiper blades for my car.. bless her heart
7207 2018-03-25 22:38:06 SA.. a country without a designated National Oil and Gas company despite the Policy Conference resolutions. God help us
7208 2018-03-25 22:37:54 Lots of olive oil?
7209 2018-03-25 22:37:52 my most painful memory has to be the one time i accidentally put like ten drops of peppermint essential oil in a bath and couldn’t feel my whole body for like two hours

7211 2018-03-25 22:37:41 But you saw the videos I just linked to you two right? It looks like Saudi defense missiles hit Riyadh, not missiles from outside Saudi Arabia. Watch the videos. This reeks of Saudi fraud.

7213 2018-03-25 22:37:23 The oil patch had to cut slash and eliminate to ensure survival. It is now time for the public sector to pay its price for government bad spending choices.  You cannot tax your way out of dept!!!!
7214 2018-03-25 22:37:21 Lies! It’s not even April. An oil change will be required
7215 2018-03-25 22:37:10 She head into the kitchen and comes back with the large bowl of pasta before heading back in for the breadsticks and oil. “I hope everything is okay.” She says grabbing the bottle of wine.

7220 2018-03-25 22:36:42 having thin hair sucks because on the 3rd day of not washing it i have so much oil on my head that the USA would declare war on me
7221 2018-03-25 22:36:25 This analogy is like seeing very hot oil and putting 10 fingers in it because you know your hands are going to be burnt but they are going to heal anyway.. Why not avoid the hot oil?
7222 2018-03-25 22:36:24 He abuses his academic credentials to pedal pseudoscience and basic philosophy soaked in his ideology, while calling everything he dislikes 'cultural marxism' and conflating discrimination and free speech. He is the academic equivalent of snake oil.
7223 2018-03-25 22:35:59 Lol people overprice goods when there’s oil price hikes how about that? Factors play in + other determinant. They’re not always right but they’re not always wrong too.
7224 2018-03-25 22:35:48 didn’t realize we were picking sides.There is a ton of Refining takes place in Alberta.well yea Oil companies are no different than any company they want to make a lot of money. 
Expanding infrastructure It sounds good in principle ,never seems to fly,why do you think that is?
7225 2018-03-25 22:35:47 Wear a condom because oil changes aren't cheap
7226 2018-03-25 22:35:30 Your going to have to take advantage of the futures market.
I would suggest, that is high risk,  you simply cannot walk
away for even 5 min.  A more expensive choice is to
simply Buy the crude oil via a futures contract.  Again
that requires more risk.  Stocks, or a stock  XON.
7227 2018-03-25 22:35:30 It just shows how uneducated the students are and how ignorant @CNN is!!!
7228 2018-03-25 22:34:54 Why is everyone protesting oil. I want protesters demanding lithium mining and real alternatives. Oil will be used until that happens. No alternative/no change.
7229 2018-03-25 22:34:51 Shouldn’t that be grapeseed oil?
7230 2018-03-25 22:34:29 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
7231 2018-03-25 22:33:47 @LincFireRescue is there any gas leak by Coddington and A st. Noticed a super strong gas and oil like smell outside of the house.
7232 2018-03-25 22:33:27 That why we are currently in an era of yellow journalism like we have not seen in a long time.
7233 2018-03-25 22:33:12 They have the illusion of wing, so you argue with each neighbours. Instead of looking at their horrific actions, like the fact they send us to fight for oil, nobody gives a shit? People will still go and vote for them based on wing but both are neo-cons, just like Bush.
7234 2018-03-25 22:33:12 @BlueMeetsWorld puts Mayo on Italian cold cut instead of oil and vinegar...
7235 2018-03-25 22:33:05 Kehinde's oil on canvas are going for $75k-$375k. Kerry James Marshall's "Plunge" set a record at Christie's for $2.1M. That seems like a lot until you look at Jeff Koons' single sell of $58.4M.
7236 2018-03-25 22:33:02 Venezuela was prosperous once because of its oil reserves. Pre-Chavez. 
Yet his daughter is a billionaire. Lots of money in accounts outside Venezuela.
7237 2018-03-25 22:32:59 Don't expect olive oil from those you malign.
7238 2018-03-25 22:32:57 a minha tb é mista! é oil free, eu acho MEGA sequinho e leve
7239 2018-03-25 22:32:54 I had a question to me,  about what was the best way
to invest in "oil"....my reply.    There are a couple of 
choices,  the risky one.  Is to invest in crude oil via the 
"futures" market.  If you take that route,   next Tweet..
7240 2018-03-25 22:32:38 Infrastructure will not make one bit of a difference if you don’t start promoting green energy over oil company profits. What have you done with your push to open ANWR to drilling?

7245 2018-03-25 22:31:39 If oil producers were financially responsible for spills KM, Exxon, and BP wouldn't exist.
7246 2018-03-25 22:31:18 people who put vaseline or coconut oil all over their face can’t be trusted
7247 2018-03-25 22:31:12 Sloppy 'wag the dog' stage show before the markets open..just entertaining for the mere stupidity of the clowns carrying it out:)
7248 2018-03-25 22:31:10 I just looked at my legs while I was at Walmart. ASHY. Where’s my coconut oil.
7249 2018-03-25 22:31:08 The bigoted gentleman is pitching citizens to foment trouble, just so he will be noticed for settlement at the next oil block auction; and I bet you he probably doesn't have need for any added funds for the rest of his stay on planet earth.
7250 2018-03-25 22:30:50 No, we need to get rid of Pharma and their criminal influence on science. Cannabis oil will be primary treatment medication for Alzheimer's within 3 years.
7251 2018-03-25 22:30:49 C’mon folks, he’s gotta earn that 3.3M from the NRA and the 1M from the Russian oil baron. And once he does he can take his opinion, write it down, roll up the paper, coat it with Vaseline and ..........
7252 2018-03-25 22:30:47 I need more oil for my elbow I can feel carpal tunnel syndrome coming on! Follow up Sundays are hard. Need to go into training!
7253 2018-03-25 22:30:46 Stir together 11 lbs chowder with 2 cups corn. Mix in Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with salmon
7254 2018-03-25 22:30:44 Yeah that’s bad everytime they’ve changed the oil in his trucks, it’s all leaked out before he even gets back on the interstate...
7255 2018-03-25 22:30:37 The military-industrial complex is the gun lobby is the Pro-life lobby is the anti-EPA lobby is the coal oil & gas lobby is the school choice lobby is the access to affordable care lobby is the college loan lobby. #intersectionality #marchforourlives
7256 2018-03-25 22:30:26 You'll be on his liver oil tablets next
7257 2018-03-25 22:30:24 Joke ni tugang suodma: "Diba te ang palm oil, hali sa palm tree. Tas ang vegetable oil hali sa vegetable. Tapos ang olive oil hali sa olive. Edi ang baby oil palan hali dapat sa baby?"

7259 2018-03-25 22:30:20 Because oc the secret army SES infiltrating our govt, sec, doj, facebook, detroit cars, oil, all businesses, everywhere. Its an unconstitutional cancer. We want it CLOSED RIGHT NOW! Call in the marines, gather and organize well organized militias!!! Enough is enough!!!

7262 2018-03-25 22:29:53 What a shame they didn't do anything when they could have been most effective? Baby boomers made a tonne of wealth off post-war cheap oil, which they still cling to.
7263 2018-03-25 22:29:49 All governments = identical, the face is different. Labour did Iraq, they all voted for it too. The tories are scummy but it don't change the fact he would of done this deal too, people ain't getting it. Saudi Arabia owns us. They own Aramco, the richest oil company on the globe.
7264 2018-03-25 22:29:41 is it possibly to be so addicted to olbas oil that you become immune to it? bc i think that is me
7265 2018-03-25 22:29:28 It just hasn’t done anything so I cut it loose and moved on. Hoping something will happen. Decent Oil & Gas plays on the OTC are ghost towns, especially if they are real 
7266 2018-03-25 22:29:23 crude oil is not a blessing it has caused many trespassing...Those studying petroleum engineering should stop because in the next ten years they wont be fuel to fill a bucket.
7267 2018-03-25 22:29:20 I’m more interesting in the people you learn from, not be motivated by. But there’s a lot of snake skin oil out there!
7268 2018-03-25 22:29:19 Thanks! I used spring mix and romaine hearts chopped. I chop green onion, cucumbers, cilantro and add dried cranberries and feta cheese. Then i make a oil and vinegar blend dressing with fresh lemon and spices. It's my favorite!
7269 2018-03-25 22:28:59 Use to swear by bio oil now I swear by coconut oil, talk about a glow up 
7270 2018-03-25 22:28:57 At least you can start the operating system with the sound card enabled without a Blue Screen of Death or kernel panic.

I'm convinced that sound cards are 80% black magic, 10% engineering and 10% snake oil
7271 2018-03-25 22:28:51 Shouts to almond and jojoba oil you feel me?
7272 2018-03-25 22:28:43 Ask till you're joy be full.Create petitions to heaven till you're filled with joy.Pray for all you need, make room for the empty vessels to be filled up with oil.
Ask without limits God is the all sufficient provider.#JESUSOVEREVERYTHING.
7273 2018-03-25 22:28:40 Sometimes I go too crazy with the coconut oil 
7274 2018-03-25 22:28:40 Mix with Garlic sauteed in Robusto Olive oil & fresh Lemon juice. You will feel like Stormy just did you! 
7275 2018-03-25 22:28:38 Ok.....I'll let you in on a little secret. Don't forget where you got in from though, ok?
Cannabis oil REVERSES Alzheimer's in all animal models. Humans too.
7276 2018-03-25 22:28:29 This reminds me when there is oil on the ground on a rainy day, and you can see those swirls of color all around the oil.
7277 2018-03-25 22:28:11 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas

7279 2018-03-25 22:27:56 These fake encounters are getting quite old, I find it interesting it occurred an hour before markets opened
7280 2018-03-25 22:27:46 This assumes that the oilsands expansion will happen whether or not the pipeline goes forward. Issue is not how much oil will ship, but how fast and in what state of refinement. #KM aims to push sub-crude product to Chinese market as fast as possible.
7281 2018-03-25 22:27:44 Oh I am so sorry......sending you so much love.....I remember Anne Mitchell from RWA years ago said try anything one of my buns ate cooked carrot and potato. Pineapple juice on finger? Come on Valli.....is she snuffling? I put eucalyptus oil near to try and help stuffy nose.

2. Unregulated untested snake oil from a guy who admits in court to being a lying fake are not something you should put in your body.
7285 2018-03-25 22:27:09 I actually agree. When oil runs out, the death of wahabism will be imminent and True islam will reign. As i said. Just a MATTER OF TIME
7286 2018-03-25 22:27:03 oil to make it easier to mix/massage on my face. 
7287 2018-03-25 22:26:28 I honestly justvkuss the ones from sprouts! I use to have this ointment that controls the oil production on my face so it gets dry AS SHIT sometimes. I just started to use these & they work pretty well! The vitamin e oil smells really nice, but is super thick so I use the jojoba

7289 2018-03-25 22:26:20 おはやう。

今日はお客にメンタルズタボロにされる日か…

今週で言えば、締め切りに追われて白目剥く一週間。

いくらポジティブを強要されているとはいえ、月曜から気分が上がらない。
7290 2018-03-25 22:26:16 How does this have a thing to do with Canada other than the world should be using our oil as it has among the strictest environment regs anywhere.
7291 2018-03-25 22:26:07 異動前最後の泊まりへ出勤
7292 2018-03-25 22:26:04 Of course we won't. 

That's China and the United States' domain. The Great Satan and the Great Dragon cannot be slain. And the Muslim world will be left in the dust as fracking ascends and then oil becomes obsolete. Back to obscurity where it belongs, fighting over nonsense.
7293 2018-03-25 22:25:43 Unless we find oil
7294 2018-03-25 22:25:36 I seeeeeeee.......I thought he’d been hitting the old oil of ulay bottle! Glad you are all well! Happy birthday Ash! 
7295 2018-03-25 22:25:29 Let’s give Mueller a shot to take down that snake oil salesman! America is not a reality tv show.
7296 2018-03-25 22:25:29 Like 08/09, oil might be another one to place a wager on.
7297 2018-03-25 22:25:27 It is not climate change Exxon Mobil did an internal investigation that found their product oil, Fracking, Methane from natural gas causes GLOBAL WARMING. Exxon Mobil made the decision to hide their research putting the knowingly placing the world at risk for the past 45 years!
7298 2018-03-25 22:25:13 @NewImproved9  Who needs a pipeline when Elizabeth May can swallow like that. Use her to transport oil, problem solved!
7299 2018-03-25 22:25:11 Cruz has tirelessly promoted gun oil as a hair dressing and personal lubricant.
7300 2018-03-25 22:25:09 Yup, changed the oil in the little Mercury. Did not re-spool yet, working on getting the garden ready to plant, then I will boat a few. Had a 5 year tournament partner come do some Bob Cat work a couple of weeks ago, sorta kicking fish around a little.
7301 2018-03-25 22:24:52 What do food bloggers know that I don't that enables them to cook every recipe using only one tablespoon or less of oil?
7302 2018-03-25 22:24:14 간만에 메인트 바깟다
7303 2018-03-25 22:24:13 They get paid by oil and gas interests and the NRA to block any and all progressive or even intelligent legislation
7304 2018-03-25 22:24:08 That’s a bold call. Oil price will have to fall.
7305 2018-03-25 22:23:53 You and Danjuma are thieves who deep hands in the cookie jars and you both steal from the treasures. He was given an oil blocks and you received monies meant for Nigerians to swindle victory by stomach infastructuralism. Ekitigate cannot be forgotten by well meaning Nigerians.
7306 2018-03-25 22:23:28 It worked well back when I had a home phone. I guess it’s working well now. Haven’t had a spam call in a while. Don’t know. It’s magic. Maybe it’s $20 snake oil.
7307 2018-03-25 22:23:27 I'm trying to revamp my routine and hope it helps. Something has been causing so much texture and irritation. Got new cleanser, oil, toner, and spf. Fingers crossed.
7308 2018-03-25 22:23:24 Season your chicken with olive oil, salt, black pepper, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper before putting it on the grill  and I promise good things will happen
7309 2018-03-25 22:22:56 انا جربت ليمون وسكر خشن وبعدها ارطب بجلسيرين وقلبت من سمرا ل سودا وبعدها جربت تقشير خفيف جدا بس دعك خفيف بشكل دائري ب ملح الحليب و الحمدلله تفتحت اهم شي الاستمرار يوم ورا يوم والترطيب بعدها بمرطب قوي مثل QV او زيت انا ستمريت ثلاث شهور و كنت استخدم زيت بيو اويل Bio oil للترطيب
7310 2018-03-25 22:22:55 Danjuma tho, like every other person who fought on the Nigerian side before and during the Biafra war got heavily rewarded for it, with oil from the Niger Delta and Political relevance.

The realities of the injustice called Nigeria has finally gotten to him. E remain Jerry Gana
7311 2018-03-25 22:22:33 I have to find that recipe. I don't mess with yeast too much. Plus I don't think my culinary skills are there to add yeast to products. I do know it included: oil, water, baking flour, salt, and baking soda/powder.
7312 2018-03-25 22:22:25 The reason Brian didn’t push back is because he believes it’s ok for journalist to also be activist. You can’t be both without losing half your audience. What would Walter Cronkite do? Stelter couldn’t shine his shoes

7315 2018-03-25 22:22:12 like you’re honestly deluded if you think they are over there fighting for “our rights” more like fighting for oil and bullying dying kids in war torn countries
7316 2018-03-25 22:21:53 I’ve been trying to get my oil changed all weekend 
7317 2018-03-25 22:21:51 
7318 2018-03-25 22:21:41 I'm going to pop some popcorn for this @StormyDaniels interview. None of that bagged stuff either. She's worthy of kernels in oil and real melted butter.
7319 2018-03-25 22:21:38 C-P-C has raised gasoline and diesel prices by 0.6 N-T per liter from this morning in reflection of increasing global crude oil prices.
7320 2018-03-25 22:21:26 La crisis de Venezuela llevó el precio del crudo a 60 dólares?  Que dice de las crisis de hoy en Nigeria, Libia,  el pacto de OPEC, así como lo financiaramente inviable del shale oil a precios debajo de los 40 dlls? Vzla tiene un franca declinación desde el 2008 y hoy es 2018.
7321 2018-03-25 22:21:22 Even with the weather yesterday we had a pretty good turnout for the FCA VIP experience.  @ Lucas Oil Stadium
7322 2018-03-25 22:21:18 Ngl, any plastic container with oil in it gets thrown in the bin. I'm learning to love myself, after 15+ years of living in a house that uses ice cream containers for "Obe"
7323 2018-03-25 22:21:03 It was covered in oil when I went with the uni.
7324 2018-03-25 22:21:00 Bio oil works wonders
7325 2018-03-25 22:20:44 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
7326 2018-03-25 22:20:26 You do realize that the USA is not a real country but actually an oil company that owns its own army.
7327 2018-03-25 22:20:23 lots of ginger, garlic, cayenne & lemon will get your body right way better and faster than meds! & haitian castor oil if you can get your hands on some

7329 2018-03-25 22:20:15 Coconut oil is good for everything

7331 2018-03-25 22:19:35 I always have the best intentions to sleep early but ndio mimi huyo. 1:19am. I drank the chamomile tea, I slathered the lavender oil, melatonin gives me nightmares nowadays and the sound of the rain doesn’t cut it anymore. The phone was also  there!

7335 2018-03-25 22:18:59 I'm ready for them to have Steven go out to that oil rig, get blown up and come back as someone else. #Dynasty
7336 2018-03-25 22:18:57 He and Woody need to drown in baby oil.

7338 2018-03-25 22:17:42 What about oil tankers?
7339 2018-03-25 22:17:41 What a stupid little girl. She should stay in school and try to get an education before she speaks out about things she doesn’t know anything about. Look up the word “journalism” in your Funk & Wagnall’s, honey.

7341 2018-03-25 22:17:31 There almost certainly is a Civil War II on the horizon. These midterms could be catastrophic in their effect. I'm personally frightened for humanity, and also see a Mad Max-lite happening in about 5 yrs. Water is scarce, oil is FUCKED, deforestation. The world is in jeopardy.
7342 2018-03-25 22:17:21 omg really ?? i've heard coconut oil like clogs pores really bad omg but i have heard good things about vinegar !!

7345 2018-03-25 22:17:11 It seems like oil traders are similar in the emontial swings to merger arb traders. It’s all or nothing for those guys. Why is this the case?
7346 2018-03-25 22:17:08 I thought so as well. Why give up the third if you don’t have a strong inclination that it was likely to happen. Good opportunity for him with the oil. Right shot skilled forward. Im excited about him.

7349 2018-03-25 22:16:39 I once watched a documentary about Van Gogh and there was an uncomfortably long scene of him just eating oil paint and even thinking about it now over a decade later makes me want to throw up
7350 2018-03-25 22:16:38 Hey, Richard. As long as the olive oil is 3.4 fluid ounces or less, then it should be good to go in your carryon! -Kelly
7351 2018-03-25 22:16:32 And you were OK with oil drilling on national park land. You should not allowed that if you are interested in climate change
7352 2018-03-25 22:16:24 Yup.  We used to export USTs, now we export oil + UST's, maybe we'll export stuff...actual free trade (**gasp**)?  ;)

7363 2018-03-25 22:15:10 It's not the government I worry about - the Indian state is dull, plodding, but ultimately well-meaning. But, some supporters of this government like to make money by hook or by crook. And they are probably the ones keeping the free data oil flowing so they can sell it to whoever
7364 2018-03-25 22:14:54 Tryna slick a can of oil... who you think you fooling
7365 2018-03-25 22:14:53 Yeah but I only smoke to get rid of my pain if my damn insurance would cover cbd oil I'd use that in a heartbeat. I've done the whole painkillers thing and it scared the hell out of me how good they made me feel. They were too seductive so I quit.
7366 2018-03-25 22:14:39 Too much olive oil? :D :D

7375 2018-03-25 22:13:51 We don‘t have that here in Europe, atleast not where I‘ve been. Oil with mustard and vinegar and seasoning (salt/pepper) is a standart vinaigrette to put on Salad here.
7376 2018-03-25 22:13:44 2. Someone else sells snake oil bullshit so its okay.

7387 2018-03-25 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective
7388 2018-03-25 22:11:58 Oh wow! You know...I'm not a big egg eater. I may eat scrambled eggs with coconut oil 1-2 per week. Again, my eating habits/ diet is unusual. That's good though for when I cook potato salad in the summer. I'm going to Google it now!!
7389 2018-03-25 22:11:57 it's packaged exactly like tubes of oil paint and that makes me feel extremely anxious

7391 2018-03-25 22:11:44 oil caught a bid...
7392 2018-03-25 22:11:25 It isn’t news that investors everywhere are still cool to investing in oil stocks/companies. As oil prices sustain up here and possibly higher for a while, sentiment will shift. That’s what KSA is waiting for, and why they’re throttling to get rid of the glut.

7428 2018-03-25 22:07:33 No the bureau of Indian affairs oversees reservations. Grazing rights, oil, gas, mining, lumber, etc are the responsibility of BLM. As for officer safety I have no knowledge. But arming cabinets in the govt is an awful idea. The Bundy standoff in NV was wrong logistically.
7429 2018-03-25 22:07:24 Geopolitical factors, such as natural gas and oil from Russia. Not anything more than nominal hatred for Israel. Turkey especially is going to want our natural gas.
7430 2018-03-25 22:07:18 @The_BYB @sh19indy what are your recommendations for parking on 3/31?  Downtown Indy says Lucas Oil lot is $20 for event parking. Other nearby lot at 650 S. West St. is $9 but doesn’t open til 5:00. Wife and I want to get there early to enjoy some of the city.

7434 2018-03-25 22:06:42 Is he selling snake oil or just marshland in Florida ?
7435 2018-03-25 22:06:42 Waste of time anyway. They dont need signatures. The law is passed. Get it done. Restrict their oil. Drive up the price and it will end quickly.

7441 2018-03-25 22:05:19 And yet you are adamant to expand drilling for oil and logging in National Forests, furthering climate destruction and destroying the homes and traditions of Alaska Natives, not to mention threatening the habitats of arctic wildlife. You can't have it both ways!

Me: point Rosema/olive oil popcorn
7443 2018-03-25 22:05:10 What? Why do you even need to ask that. What country in the world is self sufficient? Oil gas fruit crops. 99% of countries in the world trade on the open markets. To deviate from that could only be damaging. Again that’s an oversimplification .

7446 2018-03-25 22:04:56 US not there for the oil. We have plenty.

7448 2018-03-25 22:04:43 CNN ignored the March for Life which is twice as big every year.
7449 2018-03-25 22:04:37 Saladi is Saladi cooking oil is Amanita...lol
7450 2018-03-25 22:04:21 I believe what he's referring to is our dependence on fossil fuel and drilling for oil, burning carbon exhaust into the atmosphere vs using clean electricity to sustain human transportation requirements. Gas and diesel are far worst for the environment than just about anything

7453 2018-03-25 22:03:26 That's a very supprisingly centrist view of the history. It was a complicated time, following Vietnam, Watergate, the pardon, oil embargo and second oil cisis, Iran hostage crisis, Carter called it a time of ' national malaise (psychology). Amen no tRump.
7454 2018-03-25 22:03:09 No  oil thank you...

7456 2018-03-25 22:02:55 Of course the Chinese are in Africa. They are updating roads, sewage, infrastructure and telecommunications. The US is only interested in their oil and precious minerals, and not improving anyone's way of life.
7457 2018-03-25 22:02:46 @JaniceMcGeachin so where do you stand on CMB oil as you know otter was the only governor in the country to veto it. And where do you stand on medical marijuana and recreational marijuana? hemp being used to make the greatest rope in the world again as an Idaho export?
7458 2018-03-25 22:02:43 We don’t need to go over this again. If you haven’t gotten my answer yet your not listening. Maybe the NDP oil sands minister whatever her name is shouldn’t be protesting pipelines so we could increase our oil revenue. By selling to other markets.

7469 2018-03-25 22:01:24 And, to repeat myself, I am simply asking if Alberta can get by without a PST, when every other province has realized that is one is necessary to deliver services that people want. Especially after oil and gas revenue has dropped so much
7470 2018-03-25 22:01:20 Clove oil, or a single clove, between gum and cheek in the affected area. Numbs everything.
7471 2018-03-25 22:01:12 And then forgotten again until oil was found. I can’t wait until they rediscover us for magical caribou poo 
7472 2018-03-25 22:00:50 Man, it's gonna be tough to overcome losing this brilliant legal mind, not to mention the free oil change that all new clients get.  That's right folks, Joe will fight for you AND keep your car in top-top condition!

7479 2018-03-25 22:00:21 If you want bigger lips put peppermint oil on them (be careful to not get it on your skin bc it’ll burn). I mix Vaseline with peppermint oil and it really makes my lips plumper and softens them too
7480 2018-03-25 22:00:17 What are #TheTwoWitnesses  doing?
They are lighting the whole house, as HE says in Matthew 5.

What is the house?
Who comprises the house of God?

The church! The two olive trees put their oil in the reservoir, and it feeds the whole church
7481 2018-03-25 22:00:14 Fidelma - good Limavady rapeseed oil - enjoy!

Na like this we go de dey??
7485 2018-03-25 21:59:56 What was that slogan we had during our Great Texas war for independence...oh right. Come And Take It..
7486 2018-03-25 21:59:30 Let's see, because China invested in Africa? What a novel way to gain influence. Why didn't the US do that, except to take oil?
7487 2018-03-25 21:59:25 Leave the man o! He knows what he is seeing and saying. Its not about oil black...that can be retrieved. Human lives lost in Benue and Taraba will never come back
7488 2018-03-25 21:59:12 So I'm guessing the baby oil I suggested worked right my friend?

7491 2018-03-25 21:59:04 what i don’t understand is how mothers are so unafraid of hot cooking oil
7492 2018-03-25 21:58:39 If you shred it, you can fry it with olive oil, add in a bit of soy sauce and other veg. Its actually a lot better tasting to me than real rice!
7493 2018-03-25 21:58:30 Yes. I have a gorgeous one somewhere that's a blend with pink grapefruit oil in. It's incredible.

Well reportedly Hogg's mother is exec @CNN so any Socialist agenda is all good! 
#HoggWash
7499 2018-03-25 21:57:13 That is good, compare the US with developing countries.  After all, like Russia, we produce most of our oil. and would be bankrupt if we had to buy it like Japan and Germany.
Why bankrupt?  Because we have no education which teaches people to design and build things.

7509 2018-03-25 21:55:42 So pumped for your show in Salt Lake! My airbnb is booked, my bags are packed, my car has got an oil change - and it's still a week away. Small towns in the middle of nowhere Idaho are boring af - thank you for coming to a place in roadtrippin' distance of my ass!
7510 2018-03-25 21:55:37 Not the point. The point is that none of the wars the US is fighting has anything to do with defending our freedoms. They have to do with oil, keeping foreign leaders tied to the PETRO Dollar & positioning ourselves for future conquests. Not the soldier’s fault, tho.
7511 2018-03-25 21:55:18 Commercial inventory requires a contango. But financial/resilience demand for oil eg China's colossal inventory build is indistinguishable to markets from demand for refining/consumption. Physical trade is at tanker speed: financial trade at lightspeed. So trade what you see
7512 2018-03-25 21:55:08 NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHY CLIMATE CHANGE IS NO BIG DEAL TO ALL IN OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD, THEIR IS COAL LEFT TO MINE, LUNGS TO DIMINISH ON HEALTHY PEOPLE and GOLD DIAMONDS and OIL LEFT TO USE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, SO NO RESOURCES ARE LEFT WHEN THEY ARE DONE, with the advantage=TECH.

7515 2018-03-25 21:53:59 No offense, and I feel bad for the guy, but you've got more pressing issues that will probably come to life within a week.  He's gonna fire Mueller.  Have spine.  Gotta admit tho that $1million you took from the Russian oil guy is gonna be tough to explain.  Thoughts and prayers
7516 2018-03-25 21:53:59 Grapeseed oil is really good
7517 2018-03-25 21:53:57 Reminds me of a joke. Why don't the British make computers? Answer: they haven't found a way to make them leak oil yet.
7518 2018-03-25 21:53:54 So that’s actually what they teach in journalism now? Figures.
7519 2018-03-25 21:53:32 I've been going nonstop since I woke up yesterday morning and I have spent the last hour on the couch covered in lavender oil. I ate dinner at 2pm and now I'm starving. It might be the only way.
7520 2018-03-25 21:53:27 That fish oil is garbage. You need as many mg of EPA & DHA as possible in one pill. The ones you take have 360mg/1200mg and the rest is stuff you don't want.
7521 2018-03-25 21:53:16 I need to get an essential oil diffuser for each room in my house. Looks like we all have seasonal allergies now
7522 2018-03-25 21:53:15 Aloades Olive Oil thank you for following us!

7524 2018-03-25 21:52:52 Just heard my mama give somebody the most saved, country Baptist advice I’ve ever heard:

“Check ya oil shug, and start packing. Cuz we’s goin way from here!”
7525 2018-03-25 21:52:46 Before I discovered the true taste of beef I used to do: 50g olive oil, a table spoon of dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce 1 table spoon, garlic 4 cloves, salt and pepper, vinegar one spoon and tamari sauce 1 table spoon. Marinate overnight for a great taste!!

7533 2018-03-25 21:51:15 I can’t wait for it to be summer time & I can be by the pool w my banana boat sun tan oil & an ice cold beer 
7534 2018-03-25 21:51:14 I’m old enough to remember when journalism was a dispassionate reporting of facts, without bias.  Opinion pages were clearly designated for “activist” expression.
7535 2018-03-25 21:51:07 So far yes you don’t need as much oil you have to get used on the temperature settings but it cooks everything evenly so that’s a plus.
7536 2018-03-25 21:51:02 Nigga ur nose built like a oil rig
7537 2018-03-25 21:50:54 Gave TY and Xiomara coconut oil rub downs and now they smell like fresh baked macaroons 
7538 2018-03-25 21:50:36 To be fair, what are the qualifications? The last one was a one term Senator that skipped half the votes, graduated law school but never practiced. Bush was oil guy, Clinton was Gov at least I guess.
7539 2018-03-25 21:50:35 They are a powerful feudal state that is rich because of oil. "They" have been chief agents of the ideology that has fuelled fundamentalist religious violence. It makes them a double edged sword, but I would not have them prop up my arms factories!
7540 2018-03-25 21:50:03 Well, he also did it because of some trading issue for oil, the Soviets had lots of that at the time. Pretty sure one of there strategies was to push in where the oil refineries were and hold the line and exploit the oil.
7541 2018-03-25 21:50:01 Go legal recreational and LA could move up from 50th place on education and healthcare to the top 10. No need to add more oil rigs off our shores and we could get serious about reclaiming our sinking lands. Wins all around.
7542 2018-03-25 21:49:32 Don't worry, the people of Alaska will vote for more republicans that will turn their state into an oil factory. So who cares. If they don't, we don't.
7543 2018-03-25 21:49:28 كل ما اجي افتح ورق ال oil الاقيه مليان كلام بيني وبين لميس ومش فاهمه بصراحه بنحضر الكورس ليه

7545 2018-03-25 21:49:18 You can’t ever meal prep w a Mexican mom, they legit just talk about how none of it has flavor and how cooking with olive oil makes everything taste different
7546 2018-03-25 21:49:12 Oh and one more thing. I sprinkled a few drops of lavender oil on my pillows this morning when I made my bed and now I'm in it I'm certain it's the best decision I've ever made.
7547 2018-03-25 21:49:11 According to the conference board of Ca AB gets a  D in economic growth 2016 of course oil bottomed out I still remain optimistic about recovery in this province and feel a PST is inevitable.
7548 2018-03-25 21:49:08 Hard to say. Personally I don't worry about it, but most of my fish is sardines. And fish oil.
7549 2018-03-25 21:49:04 Stick to the more organic ones with less ingredients, @BoldBeardsMen has great products. 

Jojoba oil is also a good one.
7550 2018-03-25 21:48:47 Why was there oil in her mouth? She didn't question it. “I'm not wrong now, am I?”
7551 2018-03-25 21:48:20 Who can change my oil for me?
7552 2018-03-25 21:48:19 Not disgraceful at all, standing up for our rights and environment. You should be attacking Kinder Morgen for their fraudulent approval process. Or does big oil get a pass by you?
7553 2018-03-25 21:48:10 Try my basting oil?
7554 2018-03-25 21:47:58 In 2014 other parties told us "theres no more oil left" yet there has been more oil found and production of which will extend beyond 2050, I don't see how oil revenue is such a hinder to Scotland

7558 2018-03-25 21:46:40 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
7559 2018-03-25 21:46:34 I'd sand back and maybe try oil on it.
7560 2018-03-25 21:46:29 She spat to the side the oil that’d inexplicably been inside of her mouth, dirtying her bike.
7561 2018-03-25 21:46:25 I would attempt this and it’d look like an oil spill *sigh*
7562 2018-03-25 21:46:21 I hope @tribelaw assembles a team 2challenge the election & get Mueller’s report, that trump will try 2bury. All the secret meetings, calls, back channels, RU money flowing to trump thru NRA, real estate...GOP platform changed (RU oil) + CambAnalytica, advisors, Cabinet RU ties.

I mean, regulation killed big banks and oil companies so maybe it’s gonna work here too. 

So much competition in banks, car makers, and oil companies. Makes you think everything just gonna work itself out.

7580 2018-03-25 21:43:43 Almost as if it is quite easy to succeed in Nigeria. 
You need an oil well,  have faith. 
Tax breaks,  have a family name. 
Need your fines reduced or cancelled out,  have the Chief of Staff to the President's Contact. 
This things are easy,  there are nothing to celebrate.

7585 2018-03-25 21:43:24 I've frequently wondered the same, it's a selling point for many items but then people can overuse the oils lavender oil seems to be in most things.
7586 2018-03-25 21:42:52 Landline lubber!
7587 2018-03-25 21:42:51 If we believe the oil propaganda that we need this pipeline to balance the budget or to pay for hospitals and schools, what about next year and the year after? This is a house of cards. This isn’t sustainable or a solution economically or environmentally. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
7588 2018-03-25 21:42:48 A still canny see bc of the oil going into my eye from havin a weep
7589 2018-03-25 21:42:47 You clearly have no clue what you are talking about. They “upgrade” heavy oil so refineries can use it. Get a premium for synthetic crude.

7595 2018-03-25 21:42:12 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7596 2018-03-25 21:42:08 Our reptilian overlords don’t want gun control because that would shorten their primary food source (lead bullets in bowl of crude oil)
7597 2018-03-25 21:42:05 In a properly seasoned cast iron pan, acid is not an issue. The "seasoning" consists of layers of polymerized oil, which are chemically inert & seal the pores in the iron. That's how well-seasoned pans are "non stick" :)
7598 2018-03-25 21:41:56 Hey  Ginger , ..I waz good most of day and den Mom caught me doing dis...Mom put olive oil in frypans to season them and left on stovetop.  When me hungry I been going over and licking Olive Oil Off the Pans... LOL  Me very inventive in ways of getting food

7604 2018-03-25 21:40:48 All the spring rolls I bought from a nearby supermarket are stale. What sort of fraud is this? To think I wasted energy, oil and gas to fry them. Mtchew.
7605 2018-03-25 21:40:45 You're getting off track, but liquid oil is dangerous to transport no matter what way you do it. Green party is in favour of solid bitumen transportation as a safe alternative, were you aware of this?

7620 2018-03-25 21:38:42 @murad_ismael dear Murad, Fr Legion colonized, Italians messed up Ethiopia, Brits did Palestine & Cypress, John Foster Dulles, IKE, Kermit Roosevelt screwed Iran, played the oil, Churchill covered himself by writing the history... in all this, the elegant Yazidis wanted peace.
7621 2018-03-25 21:38:40 Could be the reason for the pipeline has to do with difference in oil pricing? Selling to the U.S. is discounted now because of landlocked oil..They know the oil has no where else to go so therefore it is discounted. So U.S. interests financially support protests.
7622 2018-03-25 21:38:35 It is you that is no one, a nasty bitter nobody. Must be drinking that motor oil.

7627 2018-03-25 21:38:08 We analyze oil daily and have been bullish for months due to lack of resistance. Perhaps we should dig up the videos from the upper $40s calling for mid $60s+ : )
7628 2018-03-25 21:38:06 Can we do the same for plastic or oil? Let me know
7629 2018-03-25 21:37:53 Likely question: "should we pass legislation that prevents school shootings?"
7630 2018-03-25 21:37:45 As you know, my view is that oil prices gold, which essentially represents trust in solid form
7631 2018-03-25 21:37:42 Maybe a vegetable oil & water solution can be a good substitute for gasoline

7644 2018-03-25 21:35:05 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr Are the Saudis trying to fake an Iranian attack to start the war Trump, Bolton, and MBS so badly wants? Or is their missile defense system just pure ass?

7654 2018-03-25 21:34:04 I make fried potatoes. I buy the frozen, pre-cut, southern style hashbrown potatoes and I always have minced garlic on hand, do its relatively simple. Heat a few tbsp of oil, add potatoes and seasoning, occasionally stir, and halfway through, add garlic.

7656 2018-03-25 21:34:01 Has there been a recent increase in emissions from termite colonies?

An increase in termite colony emissions is not threatening glacial ice loss, whereas continued burning of coal, oil and gas is.

It is the change that is causing change, not the mean state.
7657 2018-03-25 21:33:54 I’m curious how those questions were asked. I’m skeptical

7670 2018-03-25 21:31:27 I read your replies and responded. 

Since you showed up on my twitter threads, my impression is that you take the position of defending tight oil plays vs data I show that they are a play like any other--no worse, no better. If I have mistaken this for bias, I apologize.

7673 2018-03-25 21:30:33 1 extract about industry deaths, don't forget these...

January 12, 2015 – Oil and gas production employs less than one percent of the U.S.
workforce, but in the past five years it has had more than ten percent of all workplace
fatalities from fires and explosions.

7676 2018-03-25 21:30:14 So smoke itself is bad. They're not saying cannabis itself is bad, just smoke. And that's reasonable. Never in the history of anything has smoke been deemed healthy. So you can use an oil without the damage to your lungs, arteries and the like.
7677 2018-03-25 21:30:13 A few things on the Administrative State side. Reduction in refugees. Good stuff on the oil and gas side. Economy is good. But most of these things could have been done by Ted Cruz to be honest. Nothing much has fundamentally changed.

7679 2018-03-25 21:30:03 Looks like a head and shoulders top. Oil doesn't have that pattern. But the overall point is valid. Down we will go. Oil no place being this high. Looks like the Saudis are up to their old dirty tricks again. I hope they fail. If they ever get overthrown, I will celebrate.

7719 2018-03-25 21:21:58 The price of gas has shot up nearly 30 cents/gallon from a week ago. This is unseemly.

7724 2018-03-25 21:21:26 President trump is a snake oil salesmen and he’s conned you severely intellectually inadequate Americans
7725 2018-03-25 21:21:07 They say data is the new oil and I totally believe them.

7731 2018-03-25 21:20:23 That’s not grease, it’s oil. Grease is thick AF
7732 2018-03-25 21:20:21 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7733 2018-03-25 21:19:53 I don’t know bro 

People maybe think your head was dipped in oil like chips, I don’t know man

7736 2018-03-25 21:19:17 I wonder how this is playing with the pro 2A democrats out there?
7737 2018-03-25 21:18:48 Just get your phone and deep in cooking oil 
WhatsApp night mode will surely be turned on

#Brent Crude = 70.45
7739 2018-03-25 21:18:28 I don’t know the measurements I normally just throw a pinch and handful of shit BUT I do olive oil, fresh lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic or garlic powder, Dijon mustard, and oregano. Soooo yummy!
7740 2018-03-25 21:18:05 This has been an ongoing plan. It involves backing up our currency with commodities and gold. One of the commodities is coal, which Trump brought back. Another commodity to mention is oil. The term used for the currency is SDRs (special drawing rights)
7741 2018-03-25 21:17:57 This is terrible , come on just because she denies an arranged marriage that does not give the parents permission to throw hot oil on her .Arrest her parents emancipate the teen
7742 2018-03-25 21:17:50 Brian, respectfully, getting our oil to market won’t necessarily correlate with lower domestic prices....
7743 2018-03-25 21:17:26 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr Looks like MBS planned something with Trump to provoke war, and now they're trying anything to get an Iran war started. I doubt they're Houthi missiles because they are in secret peace talks with the Saudis. SA knows this keeps oil up, and Iran War alive.
7744 2018-03-25 21:16:54 Yes take nice drink on oil to day and night just for great part,drink to bar on get oil fire
7745 2018-03-25 21:16:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
7746 2018-03-25 21:16:22 1-
Oh. @PradierJ has already commented regarding the brioche. 
I should have known.
There is no getting ahead of the SAGE.
I like the baguette also, slightly toasted and dipped in extra virgin olive oil.
7747 2018-03-25 21:16:21 Awesome! I’m using pacifica flower power oil and Sunday Riley Good Genes and my skin is the best it’s ever looked. But I’m curious about DE. What products are you using?
7748 2018-03-25 21:16:18 I once applied my Dad's cooking oil on holiday because he told me (drunk) it has the same properties of Eve Lom. I'm not entirely sure he wasn't wrong even now, (sober)-ish. xx
7749 2018-03-25 21:16:17 Yes, because candles were invented ... just recently.
Also seal oil lamps.
And what happened to our oil and gas royalties ....
7750 2018-03-25 21:15:38 If the US really would be up for anything like this, they would have done so while SAA & Russia busy with East Ghouta. Timing rather suggests Russia will make another effort to take oil fields
7751 2018-03-25 21:15:36 Yeah oil drilling and shipping has never done that...
7752 2018-03-25 21:15:20 what if you made confit garlic and shallot with olive oil, and then used that olive oil to fat-wash some botanical gin

"hack the planet"
garlic and shallot washed gin
dry vermouth
garnish with confit garlic on a skewer

i'll take my james beard whenever
7753 2018-03-25 21:14:27 Sampled some high tech maple syrup today, Vac extracted sap, RO concentrated, Oil powered boiler... It was very refined, but I might like some of the rougher edges of traditional non concentrated, wood fired syrup may have. I am not sure I can tell. I need to setup a blind test.
7754 2018-03-25 21:13:28 Well yeah, he finished 10th in Norris voting last year

7759 2018-03-25 21:11:52 Spiced turkey meatballs and fresh pressed olive oil pasta.
7760 2018-03-25 21:11:48 Turkey is a criminal country. It supported, paid, bought oil,
and provided a safe places. Then decided being terrorist by itself and giving a "new dress" to ISIS, al-Nusra, qaedists.
Again, like the Armenian genocide
It is a matter or International Law Court
7761 2018-03-25 21:11:31 We've had a guy - seemingly intelligent and not a troll - barge in to our community chanting the breakthroughs of this snake oil "project" sounding like lousy sterEOS. No amount of reasoning/logic would calm the guy. Eventually the ban-hammer did!
7762 2018-03-25 21:11:29 Hi sure!

Cooked diced a pack of wild mushroom chicken sausage. Sauteed in olive oil (had some from slow cooking mushrooms). Added a sweet onion, 5 carrots, 3 stalks celery (all rough chopped) and continued sauteeing until spaetzle was finished....
7763 2018-03-25 21:11:29 I’m not sure this is factually right, is it? Extra-judicial killings weren’t even formally right in either case, were they? Mussolini’s rubber truncheons and olive oil, even. Of course, don’t doubt that legal doesn’t necessarily equal moral.
7764 2018-03-25 21:11:12 OK @TuckerGoodrich If fat doesnt make you fat, why does some oil? Nothing too technical please!
7765 2018-03-25 21:11:03 
7766 2018-03-25 21:10:42 If $OIL holds $60-$70 price or even higher then it should move massively up this year.
7767 2018-03-25 21:10:41 The only thing that moves politics is cash. Not just the NRA money but Big Pharm, Big Oil and other big pocket companies that need votes.
7768 2018-03-25 21:10:38 We oil get vapor No Flower! Our Governor is always worried about our health (LOL) No Smoking the Flower! Hope we elect a new Governor in the Fall. We don’t even have edibles! Vapor taste Amazing I must say.Better then Nothing! Like some Sour Diesel!

7778 2018-03-25 21:09:44 been saying it for months.  there has been very limited global risk premium in oil... not saying it comes today, but when it does its going to be a minimum $10 and then EVERYONE is gonna be chasing the energy trade like crazy people

Shame when we celebrate our ladies fast for all 9 days and daily they keep watching a light that should never be off oil or ghee required regularly they take care of.

Only pandals and what??
7783 2018-03-25 21:08:24 While at target I saw beard oil, so naturally I shouted at Zara from the other side of the isle asking if they want any. The man next to me laughed
7784 2018-03-25 21:08:19 Ok omw a bring the olive n baby oil
7785 2018-03-25 21:08:17 It did up until neoliberal capitalists manipulated the price of oil using back channels. 

Incidentally, Venezuela is not a socialist country. It has a socialist politician but that doesn't make it socialist. We have a fascist president but are not (yet) a fascist dictatorship.
7786 2018-03-25 21:08:16 So what about the overthrough of a Gadaffi, cleverly orchastrated to cause civil unrest to allow yanks to steal oil, making a massive breeding ground for terrorism in its void.
7787 2018-03-25 21:08:03 This is what i can hear the left one saying "WELL HOWDY MISSY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY SOME ALL NATURAL HEALING AND NOT POISONOUS SNAKE OIL!?/?"

7796 2018-03-25 21:06:39 Chart DOES show new well productivity. ALL wells included in Tight Oil Production. It just doesn't result in production curve that your bias anticipates. It should not surprise anyone that the laws of physics apply to tight oil plays like they do all plays. It's not a criticism.
7797 2018-03-25 21:06:11 If we could harness outrage we wouldn't need oil, gas or coal anymore.

7799 2018-03-25 21:06:00 yumm. Just curious does cooking w/ this differ from cooking on the stovetop by using less oil?

7802 2018-03-25 21:05:03 Having worked both in drinks, insurance, and oil crisis comm, and then tech marketing, it always surprises me how, of them all, it's usually the tech industry that lacks comm processes and some sort of issue management. You'd think we'd master processes & planning.
7803 2018-03-25 21:04:49 Have you changed anything in your skin routine or anything that could maybe be causing them?? Origins Zero Oil I love. It’s clears pores but doesn’t dry the skin. And an amazing moisturizer believe it or not to help with breakouts is Clean n Clear Dual action moisturizer!
7804 2018-03-25 21:04:34 Again it's about how this Orange Oil Slick is a master of opportunity & excuse me, I'm getting sick. 
He's a piece of shit & he's gonna get us all killed.
7805 2018-03-25 21:04:16 the only thoughts i have while putting the oil into my diffuser is "im makin a potion"
7806 2018-03-25 21:04:09 @AJA_Cortes 

Just received my Good Vibes Hemp Extract and Coconut Oil on your advice.

How do YOU take it?
7807 2018-03-25 21:04:06 hahahaha...pass me that olive oil
7808 2018-03-25 21:04:04 @PhilipsCare_SE I just want to say, the AirFryer is FANTASTIC! I'm cooking all sorts of stuff and they come out "deep fried" but without the 50.000.000 liters of oil! Keep doing what you're doing!
7809 2018-03-25 21:03:50 TBF, we should be. “Terrified” might be the wrong word, but there is a serious push by Americans to give away their(our) rights.

Shouldn’t be taken lightly.

7817 2018-03-25 21:02:22 God IS teaching us a serious lesson here.  Don't listen to charlatans they will do the work of the devil and destroy your country. We see THAT potential day in and day out. He is beholden to the oil, coal, and lumber lobby.
7818 2018-03-25 21:02:18 The NRA's monetary contribution is relatively low...the don't even make the top 50 donors, well behind big pharma, oil, and the unions. Their contribution is a voter base...a voter base that believes in the 2nd amendment.
7819 2018-03-25 21:02:09 Lots of women lose their hair - it’s not spoken about enough. My mom started using castor oil products and has seen some improvement but two of my sisters still have significant loss... one shaved her entire head and looks awesome.
7820 2018-03-25 21:02:01 Well Both KDP and PUK have been selling oil independently for a long time to fill their own pockets. All these companies set up such as Kar and Qaiwan, using peoples resources since 2003. It was inevitable iraq would cut budget. Lets hope people dont vote for them no more.

7825 2018-03-25 21:01:09 Never mind that. You admitted today there was anti semitism in your party. But you made Chakrabarti a Baroness when in 2016 she produced a whitewash of it!!! You are nothing but a #hypocrite and a snake oil salesman! #corbynlies #corbyn
7826 2018-03-25 21:01:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet I want to take a moment to thank them.
7827 2018-03-25 21:01:01 That’s it. I’ve decided the black castor & flaxseed oil Eco Style gel is trash.
7828 2018-03-25 21:00:51 Whether it's transportation, fracking, pumping, etc., it's Trump and his crooked admin that are destroying private property... for oil.

Asking for the 2nd Amendment to be applied as written (well regulated) is not attacking the constitution, it's being patriotic.

7835 2018-03-25 20:59:40 Maybe not using enough oil is my problem. Thanks for the cooking tips. I am barely adequate at best. My mother was an excellent cook, and I just never learned more than the basics. Come to think of it, I guess frying an egg is pretty basic....#pathetic

7840 2018-03-25 20:58:12 In the last month I know 2 people who have successfully transitioned from Lorazepam to cbd oil capsules & have no intention of going back. They both said they feel much better. The capsules were a 3:1 cbd/thc ratio made from distilate diluted in coconut oil
7841 2018-03-25 20:57:50 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.

7843 2018-03-25 20:57:31 aw mate those people that are like ‘got a sore throat, got a cold. need three days off’ are the worst!! babes ?? olbas oil, tissues and strepsils weren’t invented to look pretty on a shelfstop moaning and fucking crack on with the day
7844 2018-03-25 20:57:25 Hahaha just check the oil lines for sand and the field for obstacles , those ones that you planted in farmers roads in the 80s
7845 2018-03-25 20:57:19 Agreed but one must realise that the only reason KRG started selling oil independently is because Baghdad cut budget. Budget was cut before oil sold to markets. Maliki cut it because KRG was constructing a pipeline and to cause protests against KDP.
7846 2018-03-25 20:56:58 Hope your feeling better. I’ll tell you those airborne vitamins are a world of good. I take them plus vitamin D ,coconut oil and biotin. They seem to be help me. No more woman’s milit vitamin. They are useless.. try the airborne
7847 2018-03-25 20:56:57 Th current administration isn’t fooling fooling anybody! There r no surprises with tromp! He talking big oil and he is big oil!

7850 2018-03-25 20:56:15 They hate our oil business but wants our jobs and money! Very unfair !
7851 2018-03-25 20:56:06 It’s so difficult but try to avoid it as much as I can but finding something vegan gluten and palm oil free is hard, annoying!
7852 2018-03-25 20:56:03 i think when you take cbd oil, you also have to couple it with massage therapy. the massage can unlock the cbd that has been stored in your tissues over time. then it can really do its work. or you need some type of workout that involves getting kicked and punched repeatedly
7853 2018-03-25 20:55:47 And borders? Years ago I saw photos of black flags men entering from turkey to Syria .... and what about all those trucks full of oil going to turkey? 
Please. People need truth...
7854 2018-03-25 20:55:20 Quebec is not your neighbor, and Whynn has refused your pipeline as well but you never say a word. Your resent Quebec because you're a racist, it has nothing to do with oil.

7861 2018-03-25 20:53:59 Love Essential Oils?
Did you know that we have essential oil locket medallions for only $12? 
Snap one into a Yoshi-Bella necklace during the day.  For a road trip, swap it onto a keychain for the car. 
You can click these into any Standard Yoshi-Bella piece.
7862 2018-03-25 20:53:41 I need to get my scalp oil in someone’s beauty supply store ASAP !
7863 2018-03-25 20:53:16 Also, read history. There are MANY nations that use oil wealth to try to industrialize through socialism. Do better.
7864 2018-03-25 20:52:56 never am i getting an oil change alone again
7865 2018-03-25 20:52:47 Where is Erdogan going to get $20 billion? Putin is strapped for funds also. Somebody's oil or resources is at risk.
7866 2018-03-25 20:52:19 @EDprazz ....who’s your favorite oil stocks? Thx

Nothing like the smell of gun powder 1st thing in the am. 
7869 2018-03-25 20:51:13 Three big businesses are profiting from the continued destabilization of that region; the military industrial complex, big pharma for opium, and oil to support the continuation of the petro dollar.
7870 2018-03-25 20:50:45 Nah just a drop ma guy. You not gonna bathe the whole shoe in oil
7871 2018-03-25 20:50:33 oil is oil bigman
7872 2018-03-25 20:50:03 8 eggs, 8 oz flour, 1x pint full fat milk, a good pinch of salt. Mix eggs into flour, add milk, whisk but don’t go mad a few lumps are fine.
Heat oven and lard/dripping/oil in large baling tin in oven at 225 until smoking. Pour into hot oil and cook for 20/25 minutes.
7873 2018-03-25 20:49:54 Oil
7874 2018-03-25 20:49:46 The hot oil that just splashed on me now is a reminder I have no business in the kitchen
7875 2018-03-25 20:49:27 Pour lots of used oil on it to help combustion.  Full cumbustion is greener then a smoldering pile of goo.  Burn it good!
7876 2018-03-25 20:49:25 will be shocked if we see below 50 in 2018, now what oil business people are telling me, yes, stay tuned!  #permianborn
7877 2018-03-25 20:49:21 Do I think I'm entitled?  No. The last war fought to protect our freedoms was WW2. I don't support wars for oil.  I didn't need the government sending kids to die for oil and profits for me. Nor do I need kids to go and fight ISIS for me, as I do not live on fear.

7879 2018-03-25 20:48:59 An vegetable soup. Oil, cumin and coriander, then onion and leeks, then carrots and cabbage and potatoes. Haram masala and salt. Stir, water to cover, boil, simmer. Soup.

7881 2018-03-25 20:48:49 I wonder if Roy Moore would have been upset about the cooking oil scars?
7882 2018-03-25 20:48:47 Here we go again another big hype about a brutal industry, it along with the ostrich farming went down the gurgler last time they were touted as 'a great idea' People are repulsed by the sight of the disgusting dark red meat and rendering oil from the fat around the backside YUK

7895 2018-03-25 20:47:06 So Iran gets to keep what they've already been paid and go back to the drawing board with sanctions?
How much did they pay Trump to make that deal?
What will happen to oil prices?
How much did oil producers pay Trump to make that happen?
WAKE UP PEOPLE!
7896 2018-03-25 20:47:04 When short on food, I've had stale french bread, toasted under the grill, with olive oil and marmite. It was great.
7897 2018-03-25 20:46:57 For me, the problem is that the gov't follows the PCs in telling Albertans that it will balance the budget on the wish of future oil prices. This is magical thinking, not prudent planning. As for UCP, it is stuck in 1993, with no understanding of changes in global pol economy.
7898 2018-03-25 20:46:42 Noo by red oil and ponmo
7899 2018-03-25 20:46:38 @albertaseparate PC destroyed AB for 40 years. Norway started their oil revenue fund same time as AB and now they have Billions in the bank and AB has 0! PC party’s failure must be informed to all the Albertans
7900 2018-03-25 20:46:35 Britain did everything in their power to reverse the Balfour Declaration FYI in favor of the oil rich Arabs. That is the fact of the situation.
7901 2018-03-25 20:46:34 you have to make sure the oil is not the baby oil type - they sound like crap.
7902 2018-03-25 20:46:31 Oil & Freeze
7903 2018-03-25 20:46:25 Ah

7904 2018-03-25 20:45:56 syria, Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iraq all get our oil money. RUSSIA a well by selling arms nothing for Iranian people but more tax and poverty and injustice.

7909 2018-03-25 20:45:06 Norway, just like #Alberta with huge oil revenue but no GST or federal taxes shipped to Ottawa by the BILLIONS and no immigration either. Alberta would be as wealthy, or wealthier, than #Norway without Canada or immigration. Instead it feeds the nation with billions annually !!
7910 2018-03-25 20:44:40 Just made a Dollar Tree brownie mix recipe that called for vegetable oil but I substituted it with olive oil so you could say I'm a little bougie.
7911 2018-03-25 20:44:04 U r my friend and u haven’t bought oil ? Please don’t @ me again
7912 2018-03-25 20:43:50 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7913 2018-03-25 20:43:38 "my dog has an upset stomach, can I give him olive oil???" LMAO I hate people
7914 2018-03-25 20:43:34 Government 101. Taxes pay for services. We can’t fund our schools but we can give trillions away to war and oil companies.
7915 2018-03-25 20:43:25 Tip! Having your brakes inspected once a year, or every 12,000 miles is just as important as remembering to get an oil change. #automotive #Jacksonville #Florida #brakes #auto

7919 2018-03-25 20:43:04 So I got body oil that smells like pink sugar and Tom Ford tobacco vanilla, bitch I smell vv good.
7920 2018-03-25 20:42:54 Marco and Justin inevitably get attacked on both sides of every issue. For example environmentalists are pissed off that Trudeau supports pipelines, supporters of the oil industry are pissed off that Trudeau supports a carbon tax etc.

7926 2018-03-25 20:42:08 Eh... fresh mozz from Livotti’s in Jersey is so good, it stands on its own. But I drizzled a little homemade olive oil from a friends farm in Crete
7927 2018-03-25 20:42:04 And they have paid for it every second since this snake oil salesman fooled them.  They actually thought he gave a shit about them.  All he has done is give the wealthiest Americans a tax break.
7928 2018-03-25 20:42:01 @KelseyShaye castor oil.
7929 2018-03-25 20:41:24 Forget the oil fields, military should invade cow pastures next
7930 2018-03-25 20:41:21 Since KRG started to sell oil on its own in 2014 not only they havent been able to pay civil servents but in debt by $20+ billion.

7934 2018-03-25 20:40:10 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
7935 2018-03-25 20:39:45 Recently bought olive oil soap and stuffed vine leaves. Food and cosmetics seem to be the most common items you'll see.
7936 2018-03-25 20:39:38 Anybody have the contact info for casting at Shark Tank? I just thought of a $5M idea: olive oil - based butter substitute... I know it's not new, but this one is called "Futter" so my strategy will be mostly based in branding.

7938 2018-03-25 20:38:56 Stop Shipping Jobs out of the Country along with the Diluted Bitumen. You call it WCS, but it is NOT OIL! Build real Upgraders that produce Synthetic Crude. Synthetic Crude sells at a Premium Price to WTI
7939 2018-03-25 20:38:50 All sorts of foods, like stuffed vine leaves, olives, olive oil, sweets, dates, but also soap and other cosmetics. Have a look around in any Arabic or Turkish shops nearby ^^
7940 2018-03-25 20:38:32 And a very very rich and prosperous one. Imagine AB would save all that equalization money ! The oil revenue !
7941 2018-03-25 20:37:47 Let me add castor oil on these bald patches 
7942 2018-03-25 20:37:36 And when oil starts getting expensive, people will fly away.
7943 2018-03-25 20:37:32 Brilliant!!
7944 2018-03-25 20:37:30 I heard if you put oil on the rotors it keeps them more clean therefore better for stopping
7945 2018-03-25 20:37:29 It's whatever one is on Netflix! I'd recommend the regular Neck Oil for sure, this is quite a kicker!
7946 2018-03-25 20:37:28 He keeps selling out to that oil money Xavi. Disgraceful. He's been a mouthpiece for the Qatari's since he joined Al Sadd.  How many dead while building those stadiums?

7956 2018-03-25 20:34:27 These big existing oil companies in Canada must be thrown out! They have already made enough money on our back! There are many other oil companies who can offer lower prices and are more courteous!
7957 2018-03-25 20:34:10 No worries, god was on the phone to the @vp this a.m. 
God told Mike that since He made oil, He will clean it up (if and when) He wants to.
7958 2018-03-25 20:33:39 Pure waste. To think hot water can cook something and hot oil wont be able to.

8001 2018-03-25 20:25:46 Racing to the finish to bring you the best draft guide possible.  Coming up on our initial release date.  We are burning the midnight oil trying to get it released on time.  We will update everyone this week if there are any changes in release date.  #NFLDraft
8002 2018-03-25 20:25:33 Do the same to her sick barbarious parents but make sure the oil is boiling.
8003 2018-03-25 20:25:06 They're cutting trees down on Burnaby mountain as we speak, making room for that Texas oil corporation pipeline you're touting as 'environment minister'.  

The irony literally drips from your tweet.   #StopKM #IntlForestDay
8004 2018-03-25 20:24:57 We need less oil.
Plastic taking over the ocean.
The air and water polluted.
Why do we need more.
This is not a sustainable civilization
8005 2018-03-25 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
8006 2018-03-25 20:24:46 Sorry, Buckylabs. 85.7 mg c60/120 ml oil
8007 2018-03-25 20:24:26 @JayFromTGF you should go back to the water park and slide down the slides, with oil and shit
8008 2018-03-25 20:24:24 What has TY Danjuma has done in this country than to allocate $2billon of oil blocks; like what our senator has done by earnings #13.5m.
8009 2018-03-25 20:24:07 It's even ridiculously stupid for supporters of APC and the FG to tag the man a murderer and oil well thief, just because he preached self defense and preservation. God help Nigeria
8010 2018-03-25 20:24:05 Wheres the “Hell no” option?
8011 2018-03-25 20:23:21 This morning my mom got me out of bed by telling me to go wash my face because it was more oily than the oil reserves in Saudi Arab 
8012 2018-03-25 20:23:20 Oh so that's u secret...oil of slime
8013 2018-03-25 20:23:17 And understand oil and gas unions are not happy with Anita’s stand against sticking with oil and gas and trying to push country in more renewable dirrctions
8014 2018-03-25 20:23:11 Hi RBS, it's just a photo of oil rigs in the North Sea from a BBC story about new oil fields coming into production. And the comment is about how BritNat propaganda plays down our oil reserves when we're about to have a referendum on independence. Hope that helps #Referendum2018
8015 2018-03-25 20:23:05 The oil gives a nice glow tho 
8016 2018-03-25 20:22:59 Very simple, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar with pink sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
8017 2018-03-25 20:22:25 Call me old-fashioned, but I take Palm Sunday seriously. That means no olive oil, no coconut oil, no canola oil. Only palm oil.
8018 2018-03-25 20:22:13 Yeah, you guys didn't benefit at all for the Marshall plan, or Afghanistanese/Irakian oil. I never said France was perfect, but you can still be critical.
8019 2018-03-25 20:22:08 What's your point?! You never given a dog a sensual rub down with lavender oil before?!
I have no idea about the other book.
8020 2018-03-25 20:22:01 @acmasterpainter been looking on your website please could you advise best paint for oak kitchen units currently painted in little green oil based eggshell . Looking for a nice grey not too light but not too dark !
8021 2018-03-25 20:21:57 SHE is not leading her Province, she is allowing the Oil Companies (not owned by Canadians) to Run her Province. How much is going into her retirement fund.?
8022 2018-03-25 20:21:49 do you pronounce it oil or oil? cuz y’all that pronounce it oil can’t be trusted, it’s definitely oil
8023 2018-03-25 20:21:47 Why do people who have watched a video or two about cannabis oil think it's the answer to everything? Flu? Cannabis oil. Got a leg off? Cannabis oil? In crippling debt? Cannabis oil.
8024 2018-03-25 20:21:39 Abi Baba Oyoyo ti gba Oil block ati clearance lowo Theo ni? Osu mi  o
8025 2018-03-25 20:21:39 and we can point at @CSPI for it's roll in the widespread use of vegetable oil
8026 2018-03-25 20:21:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
8027 2018-03-25 20:20:59 Remember lorenzo's oil, where theirs a will!
8028 2018-03-25 20:20:50 Hummingbird Cake is banana-pineapple spice cake common in the Southern U.S. Ingredients: flour, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, ripe banana, pineapple, cinnamon, pecans, vanilla extract, eggs, and leavening agent. With cream cheese frosting. A tradition in Southern cuisine.
8029 2018-03-25 20:20:35 Sorry, that doesn’t work. You know that is bad example. But if we demanded oil changes and new tires covered by insurance... they wouldn’t complain if there was no limit on the premium required to make their business model solvent.
8030 2018-03-25 20:20:33 Oil companies (for example) when meeting with indigenous leaders are expected to bring gifts to every meeting. And, I don't mean a dozen donuts from Tim Hortons. Forget to bring gifts, no meeting. And, everyone just goes along with it. It's madness.
8031 2018-03-25 20:20:27 "If Native Americans had the 2nd Amendment ..." (and gunpowder and steel etc) ...."but they didn't, so 400 years later, 2nd Amendment be damned, we can continue to ignore their rights if those might conflict with our ability to profit from oil pipelines."
8032 2018-03-25 20:20:23 Omo Mo fo o. Nina is a bush girl 

Been long I heard someone pronounce oil that way.
8033 2018-03-25 20:20:01 I catch myself saying fuck it a lot more but not even on anything irresponsible, like fuck ima get an oil change today, who am I
8034 2018-03-25 20:20:00 Can there be too much chilli oil ?
8035 2018-03-25 20:19:59 Nina is too igbotic abeg, she just pronounced oil as "oyeel" #BBNaija
8036 2018-03-25 20:19:38 It's just a matter of time before our new secretary of state declares war on Iran and oil prices shoot to the moon. Some would say that's good news lol.
8037 2018-03-25 20:19:07 My mum always swore by olive oil warm on a cotton ball and placed in the ear.
8038 2018-03-25 20:18:59 The US military are the direct cause of ISIS; with their thirst for owning the worlds energy resources their government have on a number of occasions 'intervened' in oil rich countries, decemated their land allowing terrorist groups like ISIS to form, then stole their oil.
8039 2018-03-25 20:18:47 Wilson is judged on what he says and writes in public, just as I am. Some of his comments about oil/gas/pipelines are wrong, some misguided, and many are just partisan talking points. I don't need to know him to point that out.
8040 2018-03-25 20:18:45 Maybe I did just burn my food and also get burned by oil while cooking Maybe so
8041 2018-03-25 20:18:44 Yup...Think we can blame a lot of chronic illnesses on vegetable oil as well
8042 2018-03-25 20:18:30 Super hot oven (220), hot oil, middle shelf and once you've put it in do not open the door for at least 20 minutes.
8043 2018-03-25 20:18:18 I want to <3 Will bring you some olive oil Syrian soap if you want. It's veeeeery fragrant.
8044 2018-03-25 20:17:57 Hot pan, garlic, oil, a lot of salt.
8045 2018-03-25 20:17:52 Shale currently is the force holding the world in peace (by lowering oil prices)
8046 2018-03-25 20:17:49 My brother said the guy changing my oil was looking at me like wow that’s the most beautiful girl I’ve seen in my life. I love this kid 
8047 2018-03-25 20:17:47 We like oil and water we just don’t mix
8048 2018-03-25 20:17:44 I bet Trump is using the certification of Iran deal as a leverage to make sure Iran will not dare to sell their oil in petro yuan, he mostly likely to certify it if Iran capitulates.
8049 2018-03-25 20:17:30 Few years later EPA was visiting everyone every address that had an oil tank in the ground. How did they get such info?
8050 2018-03-25 20:17:26 More basic. Regime change didn't exactly work wonders in Iran the last time, except perhaps for oil companies.
8051 2018-03-25 20:17:08 @yestocarrots any chance the Silk Amino Acids in your Tea Tree & Sage Oil Scalp Relief Shampoo are synthetic?
8052 2018-03-25 20:16:57 I use it as a mask , but honey is a good moisturizer or mask on its own . And I hear you when the coconut oil becomes too much I use oatmeal and honey as a mask 
8053 2018-03-25 20:16:53 I'm of the view that "climate change" is just a P.R. re-labeling designed to re-frame global warming as less dangerous, maybe even pleasant and let the oil industry get away with destroying the planet a little longer. Thus, old school though it may be, I prefer "global warming".
8054 2018-03-25 20:16:53 Documenting shit as I go, large brakes and steel lines and oil cooler with sandwich plate in. Mainly wiring and connecting pipes, fan, radiator, trans, rear subframe, and rear brakes to do today
8055 2018-03-25 20:16:45 Use olive oil!!!!
8056 2018-03-25 20:16:38 Combined with oil...
8057 2018-03-25 20:16:29 When the oil pops <<<
8058 2018-03-25 20:16:27 I once put the tin in Busters bowl to take a pic & he picked it up & punctured it. Sardine oil everywhere 
8059 2018-03-25 20:16:27 I enjoy rubbing that oil into my various dogs whilst reading them passages from your book.
8060 2018-03-25 20:16:25 Next thing now,  TY Danjuma has will loose his oil well..
8061 2018-03-25 20:16:23 Put olive oil on ur hair
8062 2018-03-25 20:16:21 On the eve of #EpilepsyAwarenessDay this is welcome news. It is hard for many patients treating epilepsy to access high potency CBD and treat our seizures. I’m looking forward to seeing this oil offered to Canadian patients soon! #ACMPR #epilepsy #MedicalCannabis
8063 2018-03-25 20:16:12 I know you smeared oil on the floor I’m NOT falling for that again
8064 2018-03-25 20:16:04 You will spill 10.8 million gallons of oil all over the Alaska coastline.

8065 2018-03-25 20:15:45 B12 vitamins. 
Eucalyptus oil (provided you’re not allergic) is awesome if you use it in a hot bath.

Lemon tea with honey and cinnamon is awesome for your throat as well.
8066 2018-03-25 20:15:43 and it had an oil tank. First thing was to get rid of oil tank. Digging it out is when the abandoned shelter was found. Took it out too.
8067 2018-03-25 20:15:43 Venezuelan may be nominally socialist, but in practice is a autocracy that came to power via a populist coup and is barely functioning economically because it tied its well being to oil exports.
8068 2018-03-25 20:14:53 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Eric Trump began drilling for oil in a homeless rattlesnake.
8069 2018-03-25 20:14:52 Same thing if your motor oil isn't race-proven, or your frozen dinners aren't gourmet.
8070 2018-03-25 20:14:49 more value than oil
8071 2018-03-25 20:14:38 If you have "other economists", please provide a link to them. Thanks. CAPEX is low in Canada because there are no big oil sands projects underway or contemplated. For obvious reasons.
8072 2018-03-25 20:14:04 Gonna need more coconut oil. Thank God fams coming out next week. That’s the plug!
8073 2018-03-25 20:14:02 Think I'm gonna get some CBD oil from Holland and Barrett next week
8074 2018-03-25 20:13:51 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your stollen, join our club!
8075 2018-03-25 20:13:44 you like the Oil to take down the Ducky Boys ?
8076 2018-03-25 20:13:27 Courageous young women seems to really care about clean water and the planet. It’s a shame to see her message co-opted by eco-extremists who seek to see US and other foreign oil developed at the expense of environmentally balanced Canadian resources.
8077 2018-03-25 20:13:25 "The grooviest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even cuddled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8078 2018-03-25 20:13:10 “[...] the imagination pursues the foolish virgins [...] the fill-holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil. Is this how I was taught to sexualize insufficiency, the lack that set me wandering night after night, my body too early emptied out?” #MonicaYoun #poetry
8079 2018-03-25 20:13:06 Maybe if you were doing it bare chested with smudges of oil on your arms it would be more convincingly butch...
8080 2018-03-25 20:12:51 What a sad place Venezuela has become. And with the massive oil reserves there, it's pathetic. Beautiful Country and people. Unreal. Communist pukes.
8081 2018-03-25 20:12:36 my mom used to put baby oil on my legs and arms before i competed on stage because she wanted me to shine
8082 2018-03-25 20:12:09 Estoy por merendar solo en la Oil.. jaja venii
8083 2018-03-25 20:11:48 No amount of solar technology will heat New England homes in Winter. We can of course burn 2 mm bbl of imported crude oil to make up for a shortage in Nat Gas supply and infrastructure.
8084 2018-03-25 20:11:39 I spilled oil all over my stove....so that’s how my morning is going
8085 2018-03-25 20:11:25 I think its time Justin Trudeau rolled up his shirtsleeves and led the start of construction in Burnaby,making the CPC backed  American supporters of the protestors get off the fence and leave or help Canada export its landlocked oil.
8086 2018-03-25 20:11:10 Note to self: Remember to oil your hands before chopping chillies!
8087 2018-03-25 20:10:59 Haha @FoxBuchele held an hour long carnival/"Traveling Medicine" show with potions and magic items in #dnd. It was awesome, but party was too broke to buy anything (and not very trusting of the snake oil salesmen)
8088 2018-03-25 20:10:58 How "oil is doing" is hardly the question.
8089 2018-03-25 20:10:55 Dis is wat d bible calls, thou anointed ma head with oil, my cup runneth over
8090 2018-03-25 20:10:32 I'm drinking vegetable oil from this Spaghetti 

Worst I've made in years
8091 2018-03-25 20:10:28 Maybe you're overdoing it? Skin needs time to heal and reestablish an oil barrier  so that your pores don't get infected
8092 2018-03-25 20:10:15 my eyebrows r growing so fast from castor oil i don’t wanna ruin it
8093 2018-03-25 20:10:14 You used to be able to buy key and lock lube that had a little graphite in it.  Won't gum up like oil will.
8094 2018-03-25 20:10:10 I love but have only listened to maybe 3 or 4 times because they oil each other section what the actual game.
8095 2018-03-25 20:10:08 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
8096 2018-03-25 20:10:01 I jist drank some Asian chili oil not knowing better and damn near threw up. My eyes are still watering and I want to die.
8097 2018-03-25 20:09:59 i’m walking to the library and realized i still have a bottle of avocado oil in my backpack from a lab i did in my chemistry class. it’s been two days.
8098 2018-03-25 20:09:56 A bat can kill 3 people per minute
A long sword can kill 3 people per minute
A pike can kill 3 people per minute
A cauldron of boiling water or oil can kill 3 people per minute
A misprepared meal can kill 3 people per minute (might take a week)
Government control guarantees it.
8099 2018-03-25 20:09:45 We must stop the flow of money from the NRA to the hot oil lobby.
8100 2018-03-25 20:09:43 Had a spotty face since I was about 12 tried loads of cream/ face washes / spot treatments... came across this face oil.. few weeks ago and I’ve seen a difference! Where has this been all my life
8101 2018-03-25 20:09:42 MLK wanted equal rights. His granddaughter wants rights stripped away.
8102 2018-03-25 20:09:39 Not gonna lie olive oil on my eczema has def been a help.

8105 2018-03-25 20:09:09 That sounds so good. I'm using basmati, thinly sliced pork, diced carrots and peas with sesame oil and egg. Finished off with soy sauce and a tiny dash of hot sauce for me! 
8106 2018-03-25 20:09:07 You can make cannabutter or oil at home if you grow your own cannabis plants. Sign up for our newsletter to get exclusive marijuana recipes!
8107 2018-03-25 20:08:52 CPR won’t treat a gun shot wound that is causing internal bleeding or head trauma. It’s like telling someone to put oil in their car when they blow out a tire.
8108 2018-03-25 20:08:12 A lot has changed in Saudi Arabia in recent times though. I think the Saudi TR1 holder (who looks very well connected in both Nuclear and clean energy) taking 3% could be a clue as to what’s to come in the near future. We’ll see. #TYM

8113 2018-03-25 20:07:59 I’m heating some new oil and it’s so strong I’m love
8114 2018-03-25 20:07:56 Spotted a Tesla yesterday with a plate that read “OIL LOL” but can’t be sure if it was just to welcome my pal from the 780.
8115 2018-03-25 20:07:56 That’s all it takes - a passing boat -  to send a barge crashing into a wall and spill oil into our water?  Were all proper protocol being followed?  Who pays for the oil spill remediation?
8116 2018-03-25 20:07:37 It is indeed pretty futile, given that letter, to deny that a Yes vote in 2014 was a vote to leave the EU.  

All else is conjecture, so you can imagine away all you like - unicorns, rainbows, oil revenues magically restored, whatever.
8117 2018-03-25 20:07:36 Forget about peak oil, what about peak chocolate!! 
8118 2018-03-25 20:07:34 Yikes I managed to smash a whole bottle of olive oil on the kitchen floor. While I was clearing that up the potatoes boiled over and put the flame out and I only noticed when I smelled the gas.  #dinnerdisasters
8119 2018-03-25 20:07:31 Can't get my hands on any clove oil at all today. Painkillers until I get some in the morn then dentist in evening hopefully  nightmare day!!

8121 2018-03-25 20:07:17 TY Danjuma please return oil wells to host communities @MBuhari @Channels24_UK @APCNigeria @AmnestyUK @AJEnglish @AJStream
8122 2018-03-25 20:07:05 It's a connected world, everyone knows everything but people only hear and accept what suits them. Turkey bought cheap oil from the KRG as well, but no-one complained about that.  Ask the question, where do ISIS get their weapons from? Made in USA.
8123 2018-03-25 20:06:58 I ask about Palm Oil because ive learned its cutting down much of the trees in the rainforest&is destroying the habitats of the animals who live there, particularly Orangutans. Im afraid this will eventually lead to their extinction, if we keep this up. Thanks for your help! 
8124 2018-03-25 20:06:17 the oil meme is my favorite meme of 2018
8125 2018-03-25 20:05:57 Kisner leaking more oil then BP
8126 2018-03-25 20:05:36 Kisner leaking more oil then BP
8127 2018-03-25 20:05:34 Water makes spicy food worse!! At least spice from peppers. It carries the capsaicin deeper into your throat because it's an oil
8128 2018-03-25 20:05:34 He buys into all the snake oil they sell and even does reporting them. This is indoctrination, he even actively berates people who don't think like InfoWars by calling them "sheeple". This is the cult mentality.

8131 2018-03-25 20:05:14 Haha they can't brainwash anyone - they're snake oil salesmen just trying to convince rich  organisations that their services are indispensable. It's like you think other media has no effect at all
8132 2018-03-25 20:05:08 You need someone to apply the oil Lelu 
8133 2018-03-25 20:05:05 I like earth. Can't we just put the bigots on a shuttle, tell them it's going somewhere nice, send them off, leave the oil in the ground and have a big party?
8134 2018-03-25 20:04:47 What kind of grown man attacks children?  Carpet bagging snake oil salesman.
8135 2018-03-25 20:04:46 And even if you're not a fan of The Blaze, CBS also validate that the initial numbers were completely bogus. 

It warms my heart that these gun-grabbing kids are environmentally conscious.This was demonstrated by the trash and signs left everywhere. Their Momma's cleaning this?
8136 2018-03-25 20:04:40 I think something's being extracted here but it's the 'Michael' not oil
8137 2018-03-25 20:04:29 I found a fucking $50 bill on the ground and decided to use it on a (well overdue) oil change for my car.....don’t get sucked into adulthood kids, it’s definitely a trap
8138 2018-03-25 20:04:20 Hello! I have questions. Do you test your products on animals? Do you source products from china? Do you buy your coconuts from companys that use monkeys to pick the coconuts? Are you Fair Trade? Also, why do you use Palm Oil?
8139 2018-03-25 20:04:13 Coconut oil as makeup remover and night cream, vitamin C serum on before moisturizer. I SWEAR IT WORKS MAGIC.
8140 2018-03-25 20:04:03 Thanks to your knowledge on tea tree oil I applied it as soon as i was done yesterday 
8141 2018-03-25 20:04:00 Yea let's make this a big deal over the 1 person that has signed up so far. On either side it's a non issue. Focus on BiG problems
8142 2018-03-25 20:03:42 Peter Berg always makes him the hero. The oil rig movie. LONE SURVIVOR. This dreck.
8143 2018-03-25 20:03:37 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
8144 2018-03-25 20:03:35 Don't know why people are saying the #CricketAustralia cheating is unAustralian. C'mon. Cheating is as Australian as cheating Aboriginal people out of their land, cheating refugees out of their human rights & cheating the East Timorese out of their gas and oil. #Justice4Refugees

8152 2018-03-25 20:02:37 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
8153 2018-03-25 20:02:28 @RoshniBajaj is my hero! Read all her articles. Have stopped using olive oil for daily cooking after listening to her on a podcast.
8154 2018-03-25 20:02:28 Honestly, the US accusing Russia of "destabilizing activity"? Anyone remember the completely unjustified invasion of Iraq? I'm not a Putin fan, but he's had a long standing deal w Syria for the port of Tartus. Putin supporting NoKo's a problem tho. This is about oil/gas pipelines
8155 2018-03-25 20:02:28 Wouldn't some olive oil with salt+pepper be better/healthier?
8156 2018-03-25 20:02:17 Bruh I just spilled castor oil all over my bed  do y’all know how thick this shit is
8157 2018-03-25 20:01:52 technically oil enabled the wealth drain south, which instead could have reindustrialised Scotland and the North of England - Which Labour of the day had planned on doing with it , but without the knowledge of Scots by stealth theft.
8158 2018-03-25 20:01:48 Unnoticed?? Yes that's because it's drifted along for about 10yeats with very little progress. I know because I invested back then and have followed it for that period.
8159 2018-03-25 20:01:32 Organic shea butter every morning( before make up application) and night(before bed)  mixed with bit of coconut oil has worked wonders for my few pimple discolourations. Can get a huge tub on amazon for cheap and it lasts for eternity  Hope that helps

8171 2018-03-25 19:59:59 Lol okay o 
8172 2018-03-25 19:59:32 Hello and Happy Sunday all.

Here's a quick and easy lunch,a longtime favorite of mine: Egg and Tuna Sandwich.

Pressed boiled eggs (3) in a ricer, 1 can tuna with water, 1 1/2 tbsp Olive Oil. For bread, I use the thin diabetic hamburger or similar bread. Enjoy!
8173 2018-03-25 19:59:30 haven’t tried that. but olive oil is everything, healthy for your boobs as well. massage them in a upward motion daily, you’ll see the difference.
8174 2018-03-25 19:59:12 I hope this ninja Crime is not my brother that lives in SA,cos this is the same way my brothers walks ....hammm brother victor you told us you work in a oil company
8175 2018-03-25 19:58:58 I can’t tell if I’m allergic to castor oil or if I’m just being dramatic 
8176 2018-03-25 19:58:48 Frustrating how healthful practices are not supported. I wonder if the oil industry is behind it.
8177 2018-03-25 19:58:42 @realDonaldTrump is basically a failed human being turned snake oil salesman who has lied, bullied, cheated and stolen his whole life. he doesn’t know any other way to react.
8178 2018-03-25 19:58:37 It’s kind of crazy to think that possession of vape pen with weed oil in ANY amount is felony in most states but ppl also think our current gun control is TOO restrictive. One hit of LSD is mandatory 5-10 year sentence in many states but don’t even need training to legally buy AR
8179 2018-03-25 19:58:33 I did a few egg and coconut oil hair masks over a week, also using a detangler spray.
8180 2018-03-25 19:58:31 “If a politician advocates for extracting oil from every state park, it’s out of their passion for fossil fuels, not personal gain!”
8181 2018-03-25 19:58:28 And many probably base that opinion on poorly informed information which in many cases is wildly out of date, and from articles/ reports by those either biased (manufacturers without EVs / Oil companies), or whom have never driven/charged an EV themselves.

8186 2018-03-25 19:57:55  slang term of the day 
oil change: when a drug user empties their bladder, then uses a catheter to pump in urine donated by a non drug user, allowing them to pass a urine-based drug screening

8189 2018-03-25 19:57:42 2/ The second time was in 1996 when oil prices were too low for the oil sands. The Chrétien government gave the oil sands Accelerated Capital Cost Allowances, tax-breaks worth $300 MILLION/year. Those breaks were phased out by the Harper gov't between 2010 and 2014.
8190 2018-03-25 19:57:22 It was 44 years of "common sense" conservatism that left nothing in the kitty for  a rainy day (aka low oil prices).  
New govt can't fix everything over night.
8191 2018-03-25 19:57:07 I really love the fact that Sunday, our only family day was completely wasted on an oil change. Husband left @ 1, still isn’t home. Before he left I told him that the online appointment said there was only 3&4pm available. He said nah I’ll get in before that 
8192 2018-03-25 19:56:59 It’s lovely thank you, highlight of my weekend  I am trying ‘CBD brothers CBD oil
8193 2018-03-25 19:56:46 @CLewandowski_  When Trump's ignorance and inability results in a nuclear holocaust, I hope those left can find you to give you an appropriate thank you for helping to get this snake oil salesman elected.
8194 2018-03-25 19:56:39 I wonder if you are aware that the Liberals twice bailed out the oil sands? Once in 1975 when Atlantic Richfield bailed out of Syncrude. The PET, AB, and those freeze-in-the-dark Ontarians jointly replaced AR's stake to allow Syncrude to go ahead. /2
8195 2018-03-25 19:56:36 Heading out to pick up some olive oil, fresh batteries, Viagra, Trump masks, stilleto shoes, rubber hose, whipped cream and ground hamburger in preparation for our Stormy movie night-orgy. Yaya! #StormyDanielsDay #impeachment
8196 2018-03-25 19:56:33 This is what we in the wrestling/Brazilian jiu jitsu world, call “checking the oil”. Never seen it done with a toe, though. Since you invented it, you get to name it!
8197 2018-03-25 19:56:27 Looks like a 92 N model , last of the oil cooled. Nice and unmolested by the streetfighter community.

8199 2018-03-25 19:56:08 yes, all need business oil for goods, will sell more than buying.

8201 2018-03-25 19:55:47 Water is not a basic right? Health care & housing are not basic rights? In the future, wars are going to be fought over water not oil.

8207 2018-03-25 19:54:31 "oil" = petróleo

O meme ironiza as intervenções dos EUA em países ricos em petróleos, em nome da democracia e etc (assim como fizeram no Brasil, mas sem usar militares)
8208 2018-03-25 19:54:28 Are you seriously suggesting that rUK (that soon to be great trading nation) would not want Scotland's
electricity, water, fish, beef, seed potatoes, oil, etc etc.....?
Stop me if this is too complicated. I note you found EU membership too confusing to vote on.
8209 2018-03-25 19:54:27 What’s the middle ground between their position and “repeal the NFA”? Because the latter is where I’m holding now
8210 2018-03-25 19:54:19 The sqeaky wheel gets the oil.

The Left gets what it wants because they fight dirty. They have been the squeaky wheel for decades. They own the narrative.

Unless we are willing to do the same, we will continue to lose.
8211 2018-03-25 19:54:01 Ppl were given the snake oil salesman pitch. Demand was wrong,price was way wrong, markets for power didn't exist, still don't, WMA still up in the air,PUB legislated out of proper time to protect consumer, environmental concerns ignored. It was a CON game from day one. #nlpoli

8222 2018-03-25 19:52:09 no it’s fine, I get that I’ll need to top the fork oil level off sometimes but that’s just the price of a slightly older bike. I left the top caps a little loose so I can do it as needed when I stop for fuel :)
8223 2018-03-25 19:52:08 Made my own oil free hummus today. Recipe from @DrFuhrman 10 in 20. It's actually pretty good! I don't miss the oil at all.
8224 2018-03-25 19:52:08 Mom applied so much OIL on my head, I'm worried that U.S.A. might invade it..... 
8225 2018-03-25 19:52:03 The scarcest resource is not oil, metals, clean air, capital, labour, or technology. It is our willingness to listen to each other and learn from each other and to seek the truth rather than seek to be right.

8226 2018-03-25 19:51:59 Good to hear from you that he looted billions while in go vernment. What about oil block given to him by Obasanjo via Influence peddling while Niger Deltans are in penury. Its time for Niger Deltan to rebel against Sapetro because of TY Danjuma complicity in stealing their oil.
8227 2018-03-25 19:51:55 I’m super emotional today. I wanted to make eggs with bacon and potatoes but there’s only potatoes so I was like alright “cool no biggie, I’ll make chili fries”, then I see there’s no oil. That’s when I broke down and cried lmfao I’m feeling like a big ass mess

8238 2018-03-25 19:49:28 Pastas should be cooked with coconut oil
8239 2018-03-25 19:49:13 Yeah, it'll better show the relationship btwn tight oil rig count and overall production, since they are on axes with different scales.
8240 2018-03-25 19:48:49 1. Because they don't have anywhere near the tidal flows that we have along the s coast
2. Because they are wedded to the oil companies and nuclear

8249 2018-03-25 19:47:24 Unintended consequences, to be sure. 
OTOH The thrust of Trump's energy agenda is meant to drive up the cost of oil , specifically to help Russia's economy.
8250 2018-03-25 19:47:22 Pipeline planning was invasive & dangerous, not well thought out: the cheapest, the better & no regard for environment or security. Oil bullies. Mayors got together & unanimously banned the project from their municipalities, citizens didn't even need to protest. It was that bad.

8253 2018-03-25 19:47:09 HAHAHAHAHAHA JUST DO IT
8254 2018-03-25 19:47:06 Baby oil huh? Tell me how it looks after rockin it for a week... I wanna see something

8256 2018-03-25 19:46:41 Why now?  Why would Trump have his picture taken with protitututes?
8257 2018-03-25 19:46:18 I think it’s fine, it was only the little rubber things that didn’t fit back on properly so I left them out. Only a little trickle of oil coming down out of the forks now, I’m proud of my handiwork :)
8258 2018-03-25 19:46:18 High heat and oil is all you need. Stripping isn’t usually necessary unless you have some toxicity issue. You can find some methods online, they involve soaking the skillet for days in a sealed bag with certain oven cleaners. It’s a project. Just be really careful.
8259 2018-03-25 19:46:16 my child has got out of bed 7 times. Asking for a variety of things - new pjs, a drink, coconut oil, what was the bang, to tell on her Sister. Now she said she's never going to sleep ever again. Fucking hell.
8260 2018-03-25 19:45:29 For topical application, dilute with innocuous veg-based oil. I find jojoba oil is works well with tea tree oil.

8265 2018-03-25 19:44:49 I do think it's ineresting that you feel oil co's having to spend money on value-creating infrastructure in Canada if they want access to the resource is "absurd." Shows whose side u'r on.

8271 2018-03-25 19:43:15 I haven’t gased up at BP since the oil spill. They always charge the highest prices too.
8272 2018-03-25 19:43:12 Yep. And when oil went up per barrel, prices went up at the pumps. But when it went down, the price did not lower at the same pace.
8273 2018-03-25 19:42:26 Hmm good question - if you follow the link I’ve provided on my pinned tweet, you will find a dissertation & a few papers that analyzes the monetary impact of geopolitics, supply/demand, and/or quality on oil prices. Let me know if it helps any.
8274 2018-03-25 19:42:19 Aw hmm what do you expect... Music Industry and money is like Donald Trump and Oil...
8275 2018-03-25 19:41:44 hahahaha! Love this one! Great wit! Retweeting!
8276 2018-03-25 19:41:41 Well apparently smoking tobacco after surgery is a no go...... meed tp find some thc oil now 
8277 2018-03-25 19:41:26 Thanks I’ll try that. I always mix a little coconut oil in my tomato and veg soups 
8278 2018-03-25 19:41:17 try jojoba or grapeseed oil, both are fairly similar to the oils our scalp naturally creates. and make sure your hair is wet or damp when you add oils, that way it has moisture to lock in. otherwise you’re pretty much using the oil for nothing
8279 2018-03-25 19:41:13 We grow em big out there!
8280 2018-03-25 19:41:03 i noticed that i haven’t put castor oil on my lashes in a while and they’re still growing cause i take off my makeup with jojoba oil..nice
8281 2018-03-25 19:40:58 This thing of applying for jobs online is rubbish... Where do I pour my anointing oil now?
On the memory stick or on the whole computer..?
8282 2018-03-25 19:40:43 Or how about that Diesel engines were meant to rub on plant oil like hemp seed oil...
8283 2018-03-25 19:40:33 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
8284 2018-03-25 19:40:33 Not enough oil by the looks of it 
8285 2018-03-25 19:40:27 Depends on the SPF if the tanning oil
8286 2018-03-25 19:40:22 الحمدلله عوضاً
8287 2018-03-25 19:40:17 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
8288 2018-03-25 19:40:16 @AnnCoulter You hoped.  You desperately wanted to believe that the snake oil wasn't all there was to the salesman and you got screwed.  You clung to your vile, fascist hatred like Eva Braun in the bunker and even managed to sell some books so you're getting what you deserve.
8289 2018-03-25 19:39:48 DAFATS!!! dA BABE A!!! baby a representing from the south of indiana... officially gone jobba.. da hut... with my mom asking me about CBD oil... BLING BLING!!! got my mom hooked... can't wait... legal in indiana... finally...
8290 2018-03-25 19:39:39 And I burp fish oil for like 2 hours after
8291 2018-03-25 19:39:35 Um...are you trying to be funny? America did not win in the Vietnam war...America got it's arse kicked.
As for Iraq...there was never a problem with WMD..it was a ploy to invade and get control of the oil.
8292 2018-03-25 19:39:31 I'm certain a look into the backgrounds of these criminals will produce a LONG history of crminal activity and slaps on the wrist.
8293 2018-03-25 19:39:26 Fat and oil ....
8294 2018-03-25 19:39:21 Holy krap. Reason in the madness.
"Investment confidence in AB," is going to remain low as long as oil co's don't get it how they want it. To the extent that it isn't the best thing for the province, they shouldn't.
8295 2018-03-25 19:38:55 Trying to convey the concept of the new price tiers for oil being binary: either fiat or gold . There will be a dual price structure for oil, IMO, that will make oil much more expensive in fiat currencies. PetroYuan in a misnomer - it is #PetroGold . CNH will equal a gold unit.
8296 2018-03-25 19:38:51 Just it my hair cut by a fat nigga with air forces who smelled like car oil 
8297 2018-03-25 19:38:48 This all seems relevant to SCOTUS's consideration this year (already argued) of how the Circuits have handled the NLRB's "Murphy Oil" decision.
8298 2018-03-25 19:38:40 It’s so surreal to be able to tell your doctor “btw I also use cannabis oil for my toothache” and he says “yeah that’s totally fine, there’s no drug interactions.”
8299 2018-03-25 19:38:32 And ironically they're claiming YOU have blood on your hands when these students and parents continually go to a place that they think is extremely dangerous. That's like blaming oven makers because you love to put your hands on hot burners.

Oil companies still exist
8301 2018-03-25 19:38:24 Does this oil work for chronic pain
8302 2018-03-25 19:38:18 Oil change got my car riding smooth asfff!!
8303 2018-03-25 19:38:14 Protein mask girl - 1 avocado , mayo(1 table spoon) , one egg , olive oil, castor oil , coconut oil (all three just a little ) , a little honey - mix it in a blender and you’ve got your cure  , put it in your hair , cover with a plastic bag for an hour
8304 2018-03-25 19:38:11 #DisappointmentIn4Words "We don't have oil"
8305 2018-03-25 19:38:10 Two days after this, Trump took their sacred land for oil. He was also rude. His BS with Another person had no place at that ceremony. Without these brave men the war would have gone much differently.
8306 2018-03-25 19:37:51 That is the number 1 untouchable. Arrest him and the Niger Delta goes off in flames and Oil production would come to near zero. He is the jugular of naija, touch that and the health of the nation is jeopardized.
8307 2018-03-25 19:37:45 Don't celebrate yet. Wait until they start rebuilding.  Abadi got the Kirkuk oil wells back and the money that goes with it.  If they want the area that bad they need to help rebuild it. No excuses.

8310 2018-03-25 19:37:08 I'm sure they went through background checks and waiting period.
8311 2018-03-25 19:37:08 I can tell you I do not follow the advertisement sites or the feelings sites who follow me, yet post nothing more than miracle weight loss snake oil or how to pop pimples, etc. 
8312 2018-03-25 19:36:58 You are going to lose out. Because you are going to buy imported food with WTO tariffs 20 to 60% more expensive. Not to mention gas, oil and electricity. This is an island. We buy almost everything from continent.

8316 2018-03-25 19:35:59 Pretty sure that's wrong. (Its right about Sekere - I never disputed that). Russell has a NMC all 4 yrs.
8317 2018-03-25 19:35:40 “What skincare products do you use?” 
“What foundation do you wear?” Coconut oil bihhhh
8318 2018-03-25 19:35:40 The gelatinous asses of the kardashians need to be melted down and used for lamp oil like in that fight club movie
8319 2018-03-25 19:35:38 Love him or hate him, the man has a point. Whether im children dey abroad or not, the man has a point. Whether he get oil well or not, the man stated the obvious. These idiots are on a killing spree and till date, nobody has been convicted.
8320 2018-03-25 19:35:20 How about Scott Pruitt & folks like Jack Welch, companies that have profited with energy exploitation at the expense of our climate & well being? Start with all the oil companies for one thing.
8321 2018-03-25 19:35:14 Visiting Oil has been really helpful. Facetime Oil works every once in a while.
8322 2018-03-25 19:35:05 How the hell is it every time I go in for an oil change the technician always finds a problem that “really needs to be addressed” 
8323 2018-03-25 19:34:54 We are. Along with Big Oil and others that use the Citizens United ruling to become people
8324 2018-03-25 19:34:53 Thx for clarification...if I thought these were "kids" he'd probably be right. Good thing there's nothing about them that screams "I'm a kid" (although poster boy Hogg's reaction to clear backpacks at school suggests spoiled kid-level thinking)
8325 2018-03-25 19:34:49 That's great, but the real issue here is the selling/leasing of OUR #publiclands and #MonumentsForAll to Zinke's and Trump's oil/gas/mining donors and the lack of funding for National Parks by @GOP @NatResources.  @TGowdySC
8326 2018-03-25 19:34:27 i made blondies with coconut oil because i have no butter and my god does my apartment smell fantastic #domesticgoddess #cookwithwhatyougot
8327 2018-03-25 19:34:25 Incidentally, i stew in olive oil fennel, onion, garlic, maybe leek and/or spring onion, bit of dill, and use it to pimp sardines on toast.
8328 2018-03-25 19:34:24 Key out right promoted oil and via. Get off her back. She's trying to balance change with the economic stranglehold of big oil
8329 2018-03-25 19:33:58 friendly reminder to never underestimate the quantity of chili oil
8330 2018-03-25 19:33:56 I feel like olive oil should be involved in virtually everything bread is.
8331 2018-03-25 19:33:41 What I've tried: clove oil, ibuprofen, co-codamol, benzocaine gel. They all work a bit, for a bit.
8332 2018-03-25 19:33:40 I had that once , definitely use natural oils. Jojoba or my favorite rose hip oil.
8333 2018-03-25 19:33:33 Is there a remedy for homesickness? Asking for a friend. You know, like peppermint oil or something?
8334 2018-03-25 19:33:19 Regulars to this account know I microwave frozen veggies twice daily. Today I sautéed them after microwaving. Olive oil, red chili paste, and salt in the skillet. Amazing flavor. Kirkland’s Normandy Blend has reached a new high. @Costco

8341 2018-03-25 19:32:20 Massage it with olive oil to eat it raw. Sautéed with garlic is also yummy.
8342 2018-03-25 19:32:00 UPDATE: Vitamin C serum and coconut oil are fixing my face and I guess my skin is basically a tropical fruit salad now.
8343 2018-03-25 19:31:54 Whether you advice him or not he want to use oil money to settle his boys
8344 2018-03-25 19:31:36 Why? Big oil doesn’t own them! I think they’re just dumb. And a victim of inertia.
8345 2018-03-25 19:31:31 On my bedside table is a jar of joints, a jar of almond butter, 2 Legend Of Zelda amiibos, a hair brush, a bandana, a stack of one dollar bills, a small box of art supplies, a Hot Wheels car, a lamp, a bracelet, a ticket stub from the Italian bakery, and a vial of moneydraw oil
8346 2018-03-25 19:31:29 Well so much for relaxing. Took honeys car for oil change and car wash. Than grocery shopping. Got steak for dinner. Picked up a ham, pineapple and aluminum pan for next sunday. Now relax until dinner.

8359 2018-03-25 19:29:17 I assume big oil dictates what’s acceptable for them to manufacture.
8360 2018-03-25 19:29:17 Money and the perceived „they have it (and source of steady revenue from oil), so they can sort this themselves” was a significant part of the problem here

8389 2018-03-25 19:24:44 Well we haven't had a good oil spill crisis to take our minds off of other things for quite a while now.  Maybe they're attempting to kill the north Atlantic current the way they killed the gulf current.

8398 2018-03-25 19:23:27 It is amazing the corporate debilitated snake oil salesman attitude with which our wretched politicians are afflicted. Santorum, like so many other US politicians is spiritually desolate.

This literally is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard.omg. It’s so not working. It’s just waste of time and product.Try out a mix between olive oil and coconut oil. Apply this mix every evening and let the magic happen

8418 2018-03-25 19:19:42 Fractioned coconut oil would be best! I prefer sunflower or jojoba oil but it’s so expensive it does however have a lighter scent!

8443 2018-03-25 19:16:55 If Euro falls, oil becomes incredibly expensive to use, stocks may fall, then bonds become junk bonds.

Dollar rises against euro, falls against yuan ? Stocks fall ? Bonds rise and fall ? USA rises with consumer spending ?

8493 2018-03-25 19:10:40 And yet... you taint the valor of these heroes. Cutting deals with the Saudi’s? Continuing the fake oil war? Your actions are an affront to every decent American. You’re nothing more than a seditious traitor selling off favors to the highest bidder.

Because no one is willing to admit our consumption is the problem. We have met the enemy, and it is us.

8514 2018-03-25 19:08:00 Honestly it’s all so silly. It’s impossible you can’t tell the difference between a regime that spreads around oil wealth and a successful western capitalist country that has 20% higher taxes and spends those on health care. So it’s either willful ignorance or being brainwashed.
8515 2018-03-25 19:07:58 I've always wondered: Who does black people's hair in these (supposedly post-racial. Ha!) post-apocalyptic settings.  Which one of these oyinbos is outchea learning how to two-strand twist and oil scalps after the end of the world.

8517 2018-03-25 19:07:52 Nah, you wrong on that. They don't want "real" war. They want many proxy wars, fought by corrupted groups. Gun lobby wins, oil lobby wins, Israel wins, and that's that.

None of the big players need to shed their own blood. Let muslims and africans bleed instead.

8526 2018-03-25 19:07:09 52% of that oil comes from the USA. Much of the remainder comes from Norway, UK, etc. Only 14% from Saudi Arabia.

8527 2018-03-25 19:07:03 Don’t be silly. I’ve been ok. It’s knocking me off my feet still but not as bad and not as long. Although I have started taking cbd oil so not sure if that’s helping x

8538 2018-03-25 19:05:25 Make it legal to kill cubs in their den right after birth. Allow killing of elephants for trophy's. Shrink national parks to open them for oil drilling. Remove restrictions on Alaska's fisheries.  You should be ashamed to have removed regulations not proud.

8555 2018-03-25 19:02:18 Mr. Wilson, you know perfectly well that TCP transferred its EE commitments (incomplete) to help fill KXL, which it just barely accomplished thanks to the Alberta government's decision to commit its oil in lieu of royalties to KXL.
8556 2018-03-25 19:02:18 Yall I put the cooking oil on my face for like 3 minutes, where are my LASHES?
8557 2018-03-25 19:02:14 I spread some Zaatar & olive oil over a whole wheat bagel thin and toasted it on low broil. I think this is what I’m having for breakfast for the next couple of wks

Lastly it was declared there was no oil
On basis of oil America started war and funded weapons to both

8581 2018-03-25 19:00:15 You mean cutting down production over there or seizing that oil? We've got plenty. Our domestic production was down so long that many countries were able to have their entire economy based on oil exportation which has collapsed because of growth in US and Russian oil exports.
8582 2018-03-25 19:00:14 Awesome line: The biggest lie in every gourmet cookbook is- “2 tablespoons of olive oil.”
8583 2018-03-25 18:59:51 I like where your head is at.
8584 2018-03-25 18:59:34 I find it ironic that you use a computer to protest oil.
8585 2018-03-25 18:59:33 If all countries were like Norway (low defense budget, lots of oil money) then yeah, good on them for distributing the wealth. Real world is different, as mass migration brings more to suckle Norway's teet and we move off fossil fuels, the math starts to look off.

8589 2018-03-25 18:59:09 Regardless of whether or not we tipped balance, sans intervention there would have been massive sanctions, Gadaffi wouldn't have been able to shift oil, fighting in Benghazi would have occurred. I'm resisting your claim that the intervention is the original sin here.
8590 2018-03-25 18:59:08 Where can I get the peppermint oil at ?
8591 2018-03-25 18:59:06 Neither.
Same thing happened in Venezuela when the politically connected were put in charge of the nationalized oil companies.

8603 2018-03-25 18:57:02 Pt 3. Tax Cut-Gonna have to take the L on this because my boy Reagan had a fat tax cut back in the day.
Trillions of Dollars-Might be a slight exaggeration but with the U.S. now being an oil exporter our exports have increased greatly technically “bringing money back into the US”
8604 2018-03-25 18:56:58 Means so much <3 I do admit they're not that good but I am too dheet to quit oil painting and drawing.

8609 2018-03-25 18:56:23 This was a couple years ago, and we had been putting black oil sunflower seeds in our feeders on our deck. I think it was May? DH, the kids and I were out for dinner, and came home to find several police officers lurking outside our garage.

8612 2018-03-25 18:56:17 Agree on first point. But the oil money - such as it is - is being diverted to corruption and the security sector, w'out even reaching the Central Bank; so - at this time - who does "squeezing the oil" hurt? No party to the talks is feeling any pain/incentive to stop fighting.

KXL is stuck in Nebraska and Enbridge's Line 3 is stuck in Minnesota, those Americans being such pipeline rubber-stampers.

Can I actually bleach in peace?
8619 2018-03-25 18:54:53 (1) Bi-lateral balances don't mean much.

(2)  It is a little surprising that there is a USA surplus with Canada since we, Canada, export crude oil to the US where it is refined and exported by the USA to the world.
8620 2018-03-25 18:54:44 What the RMB/oil and RMB/gold contracts will do is exert *enormous* pressure on the western gold derivatives complex, and increase the gold/oil ratio.

8638 2018-03-25 18:51:53 Doña Paz was a passenger ferry that sank after colliding with the oil tanker MT Vector on December 20, 1987. Traveling from Leyte island to the Philippine capital of Manila, the vessel was seriously overcrowded, with at least 2,000 passengers not listed on the manifest.
8639 2018-03-25 18:51:43 Thanks Lee, I've found the light from the oil lamps and lanterns to be much more relaxing than artificial light. I hope to move toward beeswax candles more once our hives start to produce enough wax.

8643 2018-03-25 18:51:20 I thought it was baloney, but I threw in a flour dredged pork chop to see what would happen... I’m impressed! It’s got such a wonderful crunch and waaaay less hassle than oil frying.
8644 2018-03-25 18:51:20 I'm going to wait and see how John Bolton plays out. I think he's there for the oil (abroad and domestic). Not a fan of some of his past. I'm also not a fan of trying to scare people with predictions and speculation of war. That's the MSMs job.

Have a good afternoon all.

8667 2018-03-25 18:48:24 From a 2002 story in the Metro Pulse: 

Raja says he's been mentored and guided by Pilot Oil mogul "Big" Jim Haslam II, on the subject of community involvement. Haslam told him, "If you want to live in the community, you have to pay the rent,"

As early as 2002, folks.
8668 2018-03-25 18:48:21 I just listened to Jason Burack's interview of Daniel LaCalle. In relation to the question of the RMB/oil contract, both interviewer and interviewee completely misapprehend and misrepresent the issue, indicating neither have seriously examined it. +

8670 2018-03-25 18:48:05 When Notley gets hyperbolic and says there isn't a school, highway etc in Canada that doesn't owe something to AB oil industry I laugh. So much Quebec infrastructure doesn't owe AB a thing.
8671 2018-03-25 18:47:58 Autonomous? Contentious in my humble opinion. Dictating policies? I think by virtue of the incorporation of officers in different cabinet positions, the military has seen more of its tasks linked to provision in those areas (e.g. food distribution, oil extraction). 1/2
8672 2018-03-25 18:47:54 Father's teaching Sons to fix a Car, change tire or oil. Hunting. Mother's teaching Daughters to sew clothing, preparation of food and Cooking. Parent's have gotten lazy and use technology to raise and teach their kids. But it's hurting them. Making them helpless n useless.

8691 2018-03-25 18:45:24 Watching #BeforeTheFlood. I know there are climate change deniers but christ it is so incredibly frustrating to see the scale of it in US government. Deniers who will be the last to be affected due to what their millions in oil company bribes can get them.
8692 2018-03-25 18:45:22 Feathers and several bent steel rules, caked in engine oil. Filling my guts.
8693 2018-03-25 18:45:21 Lol the comment you added makes this even better
8694 2018-03-25 18:45:04 Getting my oil changed and bored already. It’s been 5 minutes. Going to be one of those days.
8695 2018-03-25 18:44:33 I’ve been using frankincense oil and it’s been helping, trying it out
8696 2018-03-25 18:44:28 Hi David, no need to unhook. If you oil over in a lay-by etc, drop the jockey wheel and rear steadies to stop caravan from bouncing etc.
8697 2018-03-25 18:44:27 No - I'm a facecloth and cleansing oil fan myself but I know a lot of people who are really attached to those removal pads
8698 2018-03-25 18:44:12 If they had a clue about economics they’d realize we can’t just shut off the oil and gas industry or shut off the coal industry or shut own the oil sands and power our house off hopes and dreams. But they’re going to try and it won’t be long before we’re taking out a loan to pay
8699 2018-03-25 18:44:01 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
8700 2018-03-25 18:44:00 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8705 2018-03-25 18:42:49 Don’t cheap out on fragrance oils for your oil diffuser. My “French vanilla” smells like baby powder, and my strawberry smells like honey suckles. I’m not upset or anything, neither of them smell bad, but it’s not exactly what I was going for lol
8706 2018-03-25 18:42:43 I’m glad they’re not leaking oil!
8707 2018-03-25 18:42:43 While I object in principle to an oil refinery being built in East End Grand Bahama, this area once being destination as being developed for Eco-Tourism, it is simply amazing how with just the suggestion some already have an oil spill in the area...
8708 2018-03-25 18:42:39 Perfect way to care for your vagina. 
1 Rub groundnut oil on it
2 Slice onions and add two teaspoons of salt. 
3 Add a little chocolate to the lower part. 
4 Now fry it. 5 Add a little nutmeg and 'kitchen glory '
6 Do this morning and night for 5 days out of a week.
8709 2018-03-25 18:42:38 I use the Sunday Riley night oil every night too and I really like it. Have been meaning to try the UFO one
8710 2018-03-25 18:42:37  Use coconut oil  eat fruit                                                    drink water                                            mind your business
8711 2018-03-25 18:42:35 @AFIPcomunica tengo que denunciar algo: desde 2011 que pago los impuestos cuando cargo en Oil pero a ustedes no les importa y se los dejan al dueño. Pero a mí sí me intiman. Fíjate, hay algo muy corrupto ahí
8712 2018-03-25 18:42:30 Don’t medical errors account for some 200,000+ deaths per year?
8713 2018-03-25 18:42:28 No that was more an olive oil advert than a horror.
8714 2018-03-25 18:42:22 This guy should rot in prison.  Selling his daughter and burning her with oil.  Disgusting.  Does Islam allow this?  Are they speaking out against this?   Silence is consent.
8715 2018-03-25 18:42:21 Normally don’t experience #FOMO with my peanut allergy, but I do when the restaurant only fries with peanut oil and the food looks so good 
8716 2018-03-25 18:41:56 "Texas teen was beaten, had hot cooking oil poured on her after refusing arranged marriage:" Still goes to prove that they are still back in the stone age even when living in this country. Shame!
8717 2018-03-25 18:41:51 Yes, but even articulating what the improvements need to be has been like pulling teeth – Zuck's "crazy" quote, etc. It took the oil industry a century to even begin to acknowledge the negative externalities of their business, how long will it take Social Media?
8718 2018-03-25 18:41:47 I'm salty because being Asian prevents me for having a glorious beard which precludes me from having cool accessories like beard oil and Combs :(
8719 2018-03-25 18:41:36 na, it's okay, that was the oil too!

8724 2018-03-25 18:40:32 Broadcasting live at Excalibur Motors --- free oil changes for life --- yep -- you heard me right - come see us!!
8725 2018-03-25 18:40:27 point being they can't really bring in someone with > 2yrs left without having to face expansion issues (assuming they can make Russell & Lucic disappear before then as well)
8726 2018-03-25 18:40:24 The link is STILL not working! Says a lot about ur company doesn't it? Can u guarantee ALL your #palmoil is NOT milled with palm oil from other farmers who have killed & burnt in order to plant these awful mono crops that do nothing to replace the natural flora & fauna destroyed?
8727 2018-03-25 18:40:20 So, got a free .@winnipegsun while waiting for my oil change. I see 'NEWS' heading on a few columns... not awesome but whatevs... THEN at first 'Comment' section, pg 13. I see the SAME column as on pg 10. Really not impressed by either of these errors.. but 2gether = shoddy

8733 2018-03-25 18:39:47 I thought the lack of democracy in the Middle East was more down to the economies of the region being utterly distorted by oil.
8734 2018-03-25 18:39:39 @GoyaFoods there are some amazing sources of certified organic and sustainable sources of palm oil from Latam. Colombia and Ecuador in particular. Let me know if you would like to contact them.
8735 2018-03-25 18:39:39 Recaro seats. 3 spoke steering wheel .Speedo and rev counter with oil pressure gauge and temp in the instrument pod ....all you need ......oh and some tunes
8736 2018-03-25 18:39:34 They can. The technology does is available. Gun Manufacturers see it as a Threat. It will eventually curb the sales, e.g. loopholes on Internet, Gun Show and Criminal underworld gun sales.
In the late 1800s and up until early 1900s, Ford & co had electric cars. Oil Co killed them
8737 2018-03-25 18:39:30 Rust, greace and many types of oil later I think I deserve a good bath! And my lush order has arrived so it's a great day!
8738 2018-03-25 18:39:25 Oil and pipeline companies make business decisions. TCP couldn't secure subscriptions (or funding) for two pipelines and chose KXL as the better bet, but still hasn't announced that KXL is a formal "go". KXL is still hung up in Nebraska.

8740 2018-03-25 18:39:21 I'm the type of girl to throw in olive oil & then spray the pan with spray 'n cook. 
8741 2018-03-25 18:39:17 yes but yours had more olive oil in it
8742 2018-03-25 18:39:13 Blame the oil industry for why electric cars only just now begun to go mainstream again.
8743 2018-03-25 18:39:04 Maybe the chips because of mafuta. Overly recycled oil is actually toxic.
8744 2018-03-25 18:38:44 For soup, cook sliced onion in oil, then simmer with chicken, green curry paste, chicken broth and asparagus. Top with rosemary.
8745 2018-03-25 18:38:36 (of course, a smart team might have to move on from him after that yr anyway rather than pay him)
8746 2018-03-25 18:38:34 I loathe hate scorn vilify and detest absolutely everything about the oil companies from soup to nuts if you want to throw them in the mix, sure
8747 2018-03-25 18:38:33 Indeed, economic freedom does best in the end. And this is true of business which is why successful welfare states HAVE IT (again). However for college and health and jails, it PROVABLY results in worse outcomes. Hence success of high tax welfare states, even those sans oil.
8748 2018-03-25 18:38:18 It’s one I got from Sally’s with mayonnaise, and then I use a hot oil treatment. It’s made all my blonde grow out and my hair is half ways to my back in 1 year

8757 2018-03-25 18:37:40 Stop consuming palm oil already.
8758 2018-03-25 18:37:36 Well my first guess is: there was a slight "typo" - could have been in either direction. OR case of mistaken identity. The Russian oligarch thought he was buying a special chemical needed in oil refinery process called "conservative solution" (TM)- an order for 750,000 barrels.

8764 2018-03-25 18:36:53 So you hate the company or the outcomes? The oil giants have done a lot of bad but they transformed the global economy. To me, it's too over-simplified to ~hate~ companies/industries that so change society. Their outcomes? Yes I can see villifying that.

8775 2018-03-25 18:35:27 why are synthetic oil changes so expensive 
8776 2018-03-25 18:35:24 I think May will be very scared indeed of a fight with Scotland just now. We're very close to a majority for independence, and once we get it, she has neither fishing rights nor oil nor much renewable energy to bargain with.

8780 2018-03-25 18:34:52 I have not yet read the article, but my initial reaction is that Oil companies as well as the national government have failed the people of the world by poorly regulating the production of fossil fuels

8818 2018-03-25 18:29:06 Use oils like argan oil before air drying or blow drying and divide your hair into sections and use the wet brush cause it's amazing it works on dry or wet hair. It's a game changer for me

8830 2018-03-25 18:28:27 When you walk into the car parts store with oil stained onto your hands, it’s kind of like a badge of honor.
8831 2018-03-25 18:28:22 Because our leaders are thieves, they thief the money, look at some countries they have the same oil that we have but they used it judiciously.see when you have thieves as leaders they will finish you and your organization, right from 90s our leaders from A to Z are thief.
8832 2018-03-25 18:28:19 A lot of ignorance out there. 
None can define assault weapon beyond AR 15/AK47.
Not many WANT to know, just repeating a phrase ovr n ovr
8833 2018-03-25 18:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

cooking a simple ham.

8836 2018-03-25 18:27:34 Definately need some shilling oil...
8837 2018-03-25 18:27:24 CT kills growth.  For evidence, look to oil recovery in Canada versus other jurisdictions.
8838 2018-03-25 18:27:16 it worked with Klefbom in 2017 and can work again. Trading for need isnt a good idea
8839 2018-03-25 18:26:54 Or you could change the oil yourself like a real man
8840 2018-03-25 18:26:40 Auto-correct should have saved me on the ‘

And no hate for Quebec. Ever. My roots. My disdain is for the anti-pipeline folks who welcome foreign oil up the SLSeaway. And accept massive sewage discharges because they don’t have treatment infrastructure...

8842 2018-03-25 18:26:32 My boyfriend doesn't care hey.  We go to the mall because I want the olive oil on special at checkers hyper and then he says he's hungry and chooses a fancy restaurant when I'm looking like a zombie in search for specials 
8843 2018-03-25 18:26:11 Tobacco? Oil/gas/tracking? Monsanto?
8844 2018-03-25 18:26:00 Coconut oil on moghels body, a shimmer shine.. Love it
8845 2018-03-25 18:25:53 Thanks. 
Yeah I follow rick Simpson on Facebook. 
Is it the thc oil he advises people to take?
8846 2018-03-25 18:25:47 A two-tier oil market is starting tomorrow. Those paying w/ gold and those w/ fiat (USD, Euros, etc.). The London paper-based gold market will be leveled by price insensitive physical gold demand that will ignore the fictitious paper price action. #PetroGold It will take time.

8849 2018-03-25 18:25:31 Same man you heckled as Fulani/oil block cabal has suddenly become your hero because of your seething hatred for PMB.

Please get well soon...
8850 2018-03-25 18:25:24 Hi Anna, sorry not been in touch but been difficult time, my Mum diagnosed with breast cancer. Trying to get her doing Gersen Therapy juice diet + the wonder oil that starts with C! My friend cured herself that way & she'd been written off by Dr's. Fingers crossed. 

How're U? XX
8851 2018-03-25 18:25:07 All these people are openly advertising they are great targets for crime. None of them are armed.
8852 2018-03-25 18:24:54 Fishing around for it was the beginning of the end of her do it yourself oil changing days!
8853 2018-03-25 18:24:52 That's the problem, you can't believe them. Histroy proves that. We don't need big government,we need less. We need more capitalism with more and better social programs. We don't need socialism. There's a difference. We have the cleanest oil in the world and we are being punished
8854 2018-03-25 18:24:48 Hot vegetable oil don burn my hand 

I'm in tears ...

I'm fed up
8855 2018-03-25 18:24:44 Have you use Jamaican black castor oil? It’s the only thing that works for me. I have super dry hair
8856 2018-03-25 18:24:41 Too wee and too poor for all this oil.
8857 2018-03-25 18:24:40 I’m all for refineries in Alberta to be honest, but it’s not my decision. Why not encourage that instead of the pipeline then? Also, it’s oil sands, not tar sands. You prefer oil from human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, thats on you.
8858 2018-03-25 18:24:36 Are Analysts Bullish about Imperial Oil Limited (TSE:IMO) after last wee...
8859 2018-03-25 18:24:23 “You can’t eat gravel. You can’t drink oil. You can’t farm land on which the topsoil has been removed.” Why won’t @Kathleen_Wynne @fordnation @AndreaHorwath sign the @FoodWaterFirst pledge like @MikeSchreiner? #greenvisiontour #onpoli
8860 2018-03-25 18:24:15 There are marine accidents with resulting oil spills everyday.
8861 2018-03-25 18:24:01 I just wanna get my oil change , be a fat bitch grab a 4 for $4 from Wendy’s and keep it moving ...
8862 2018-03-25 18:23:59 Fair enough. Well if folks are upset at a pipeline project that will help Canada overall, but not upset at the foreign oil tankers up & down our coasts, I really don’t know what to say? It’s silly.
8863 2018-03-25 18:23:58 That’s oil sands. 

And do you drive a car or bike on pavement?
8864 2018-03-25 18:23:58 I love coconut oil but it takes so long to get it out of my hair 
8865 2018-03-25 18:23:57 しこるな
8866 2018-03-25 18:23:50 Seriously? 2015-16 was a recession for Canada's oil industry - where the investment fled.
8867 2018-03-25 18:23:45 The threat of US military (more than NATO spending) keeps them safe, fossil fuels & whaling are/were their primary revenue (libs never want to talk about that).. turn off the oil, like Venezuela, and the illusion crumbles.
8868 2018-03-25 18:23:26 Look for Skinner to be traded to the Oil Kings. Play another year Of Jr. under the watchful eye of the goalie coach.
8869 2018-03-25 18:23:26 Are you seriously this stupid? I fucking hate Kurdish authorities, but Iraqi government is a piece of shit as well, nearly all the oil fields were handed back to Baghdad after 16th of October, only a a couple of fields are in KRG hands, so they should send most of the budget
8870 2018-03-25 18:23:13 Are those “Algorithms” as good as the Cambridge Analytical “Snake Oil Salesmen” and their journalistic supporters, would have us believe.
8871 2018-03-25 18:23:12 heroin was invented by the gov to fight morphine addiction after the civil war and was sold by carpet baggers as snake oil
8872 2018-03-25 18:23:04 Amazing, isn't it?
The lengths the Lefties will go to in covering up criminal activities committed by Broward County bureaucrats & public servants.
8873 2018-03-25 18:22:53 Oil was here before poop.
8874 2018-03-25 18:22:35 Lol I hate how my mom uses the situation of a long time family friend who only paid for an oil change and her engine blew, so yes of course it's going to happen to me
8875 2018-03-25 18:22:32 You need an oil free night mask or serum
8876 2018-03-25 18:22:26 Whale oil or tallow?
8877 2018-03-25 18:22:18 My ass turkey always come into a conflict when there is sure victory..in the meantime they buy the cheap oil from the head choppers ..dont play as if you are warriors. Trump and his russian love is ebbing, then turkey will be spanked
8878 2018-03-25 18:22:06 The US think tank nos there will be shale oil, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, that will  shrink how much oil Nigeria  export, decreasing of oil rent which is the reasons for one Nigeria by British olonialists.  @USEmbassyAbuja @realDonaldTrump
8879 2018-03-25 18:22:01 Keep pumping that has and oil
8880 2018-03-25 18:21:50 Id literally pay somebody to take my car to get this oil change 
8881 2018-03-25 18:21:42 @F1 So, I'm just going to say it. Ferrari is using some sort of passive 2-cycle system or at least something akin to what Audi is using in its road cars because those cars also consume oil. This is the ransom to keep the Scuderia in the sport. #smogtest
8882 2018-03-25 18:21:23 OK is changing. So many are fed up with legislators that lowered tax on gas & oil during boom but now refuse to raise to fund basic needs like education. Teacher walk out 4.2. If dialogue emphasizes keeping 2a, many cons will vote for candidates that are mainstream dems
8883 2018-03-25 18:21:04 Did a nice face mask, hot oil treatment for my hair, whitened my teeth, on my 7th cup of water, cleaned my chain and read Galatians 5:1. Sunday’s are the best days off
8884 2018-03-25 18:21:02 SpaceX's rocket landing blooper reel is hot oil over medium heat oil over medium heat oil prices in Russia.

8895 2018-03-25 18:18:42 Severely disappointed that the guys at @jiffylube just overcharged me for an oil change. *sigh* Hope it isn’t because I’m a woman and they assume idk my car. Infuriating!

8897 2018-03-25 18:18:39 The Remain camp also used data mining with algorithms to target voters. If campaigns want to lavish money on the modern equivalent of snake oil salesmen that's their business but it will be impossible for them to know whether or not their money was well spent
8898 2018-03-25 18:18:26 The thought of Chiarelli going out and giving up something of quality, for a supposed PP specialist scares the hell out of me.

8900 2018-03-25 18:18:19 Correction! These people are land and water protectors. You journalists need to stop painting them in a negative light. In doing so you are allowing the govt and the oil industry utilize bill c 51 to force through their agendas. By brutal force. It’s on you, any harm to them

8904 2018-03-25 18:17:59 Yeah but the wealth is centred on oil meaning that it’s in the hands of the few. Our economy relies on the many. They need a thriving equal economy

8922 2018-03-25 18:15:46 The reason our state is circling the drain lies with our GOP politicians who gave oil companies $ that would have funded our schools etc.

8933 2018-03-25 18:14:40 Turkeys problem is climbing oil prices while TRY is devaluating. Also rather weak against rubel. They NEED foreign capital which is more and more difficult to get. I would not be amazed if Erdogan is going to make war for oil.

8935 2018-03-25 18:14:31 The oil industry, govts and  everyone invested should be charged with murder
8936 2018-03-25 18:14:21 ya I find it ironic that everything they now need they used to have.
8937 2018-03-25 18:14:17 Also this idea that any country masks poor economic setup with resources is IGNORANT. Literally every country using oil or others as crutch has HORRID economy ultimately. Norway, etc., use natural resources to develop liberal free markets and thrive.

8945 2018-03-25 18:13:55 Don’t mischaracterize my positions. I’m incensed by what’s happening in Yemen. I think we need to cut ties with the Saudis altogether including not buying their oil. You’re so focused on erecting ‘centrist’ straw men to attack you don’t know who the real enemy is.
8946 2018-03-25 18:13:34 I would love to oil your body up for you
8947 2018-03-25 18:13:33 Keeping a good regime like that will help, and putting grease/oil in it when you braid it will keep it “fed” and moisturize
8948 2018-03-25 18:13:31 Sorry I've been used to them wanting an Iraq war that I wrote Iraq when I meant to say Iran - they want a war with Iran so they can control the oil

8956 2018-03-25 18:12:36 @MertyBeth So I did a thing today. Sliced up some daikon radishes like french fries and fried them up in olive oil. Eating them alongside hamburgers on lettuce wraps with my low sugar ketchup. SO GOOD!
8957 2018-03-25 18:12:32 Well Carrie! Aren't you so smart? You think it's better for eastern canadians to buy Arab oil that Alberta oil? Are you a dimwit or what. Trudeaus in bed with the Arabs. Look who he gave your tax dollars to?

8982 2018-03-25 18:10:09 This is another myth.  Norway is a well rounded economy, not simply giving oil money to people. Russia is giving oil to people, which is why Norway thrives through oil price drops, Russia tumbles into crisis. U.S. is full of oil too. In any case Nordic model works for others too.

9143 2018-03-25 17:50:30 It cleanses your hair & scalp pretty well, gets rid of extra build up & gives your hair some shine, I just mixed 2 tbs in with a cup of water and lemon juice, sprayed it into my hair, then rinsed it out and then ima add some leave in conditioner & oil and twist my hair.
9144 2018-03-25 17:50:14 Facebook has prioritized profit over responsible stewardship of its product since its inception. Zuckerberg sells user data w/little to no interest in whether the "product" is 'snake oil' or propaganda; or whether the source is a US ally or not, just the profits rolling in.
9145 2018-03-25 17:50:04 Fuck no that’s for peasants I get it done for free but quality oil and filters are expensiveeee and I get 15% off and still comes out to 99 bones

9148 2018-03-25 17:49:25 While I agree with alternatives to oil and gas. As of now I need it to raise my family. I use some form of it everyday to do so. I don’t believe I or others that depend on it at the moment should be painted as bad guys for doing so.

9154 2018-03-25 17:48:57 Mostly shading of meaning. As I understand it, a panacea was originally purely hypothetical; e.g., a tablespoon of cod liver oil is a panacea for whatever ails you. Agree it’s probably too fine a point.
9155 2018-03-25 17:48:56 Does every single pipeline burst? No they don’t. The benefits outweigh the risks, & in the long run, it is better to transport oil via pipe than by road & rail.
9156 2018-03-25 17:48:51 Matt, they're good for you, like cod liver oil and root canals.
9157 2018-03-25 17:48:36 How about Christians start talking about the SECOND Trinity? They are taught by the cabal preachers that there is only ONE trinity. There is 1) The spiritual Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Ghost) 2) The Earthly Trinity (Earth, Air, Water). The Holy oil is from the 2nd Trinity
9158 2018-03-25 17:48:34 I need to figure out what kind of oil works for my hair. It’s so dry

9164 2018-03-25 17:48:03 Its horrendous, but it's normal behavior in the Muslim community, hot oil, acid, whatever will cause permanent disfiguring and the most pain.

9174 2018-03-25 17:46:50 This region is ridiculous and the situation is getting out of hand, this has been going on since 2014 and the people of Kurdistan are too accepting, or better said uneducated. Oil and power is better given to Iraq, we were better off when they were in charge of finances

9216 2018-03-25 17:41:03 We should annex Mexico and break it up into new US states. Clearly we need their less expensive and large labor pool and they are desperate for our rule of law. PLUS, they are a big oil producer. Once that is achieved, we can work on Central America’s issues. Big picture.

9231 2018-03-25 17:39:18 They were given international sovereignty to invade, take their oil back, and then leave after 48 months. They took the whole country. So the first coalition was made. And now here we are.

9242 2018-03-25 17:37:58 10,000 is a nice size, especially when you spread the idea that as soon as the pipeline is built, it’ll fail immediately & BC will become some oil soaked dystopia. Fear is quite a powerful motivator, but so is prosperity, which is what a pipeline would bring.
9243 2018-03-25 17:37:53 There is a sudden emergence of "Gulf Experts". This reminds me of the "September Twelvies" that suddenly became experts on terrorism. When I started Gulf studies many thought it was a low demand "boring" field with mundane politics of oil rich monarchies. Today that changed. #GCC
9244 2018-03-25 17:36:53 This argument is why I only use olive oil on my waffles.

Doesn't have to be expensive or elaborate. I'm doing a coconut oil hair mask and cuddling the cat. 
9249 2018-03-25 17:36:19 I understand. I was just explaining that if Iraq would have just taken the oil fields then the last 17 years in The middle East wouldn't have happened.
9250 2018-03-25 17:36:13 Pre pooing my hair with fresh Aloe Vera gel, turmeric infused oil water, and a castor/sweet almond/olive & Jamaican mango black castor oil mix .
9251 2018-03-25 17:36:02 Smoking hot oil, and don't open oven door til they are done! To make 12: 2 large free range eggs, 100ml whole milk and 100g plain flour, pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk well, no need to rest. Always works really for me!
9252 2018-03-25 17:36:00 With dogs it's called mange. If you feed them put some olive oil on the food. That should help

9254 2018-03-25 17:35:49 ooh, coconut oil...
9255 2018-03-25 17:35:33 60-65 is a perfect price for oil imo
9256 2018-03-25 17:35:33 Oilers gonna oil.
9257 2018-03-25 17:35:24 You compared a "service" firm like Infosys or diversified conglomerate like Kotak with the world's largest tech giants, who have toppled biggest energy, oil, steel businesses, just by sheer power of technology. I am astounded by such stupidity. I won't engage further. Sorry.

9266 2018-03-25 17:34:30 i can’t find any good oil pastel artists.
9267 2018-03-25 17:34:28 Apart from skin tak terjaga, I noticed that my hair is now drier than grandma vag. Now I understand why Indians love to put a lot of oil on their hair. It’s to protect from the heat and to lock the moisture.

9273 2018-03-25 17:33:43 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

9275 2018-03-25 17:33:14 Iraq invaded Kuwait because Kuwait was drilling underneath Iraq's borders and stealing their oil. The CIA told the WH that an Iraq invasion would happen but it was justified for them to take the oil fields in NW Kuwait. Iraq made the mistake of taking the whole country.

9287 2018-03-25 17:31:55 Lots of work to be done. I'm buying a book Dreamers to catch up too. Think it applies to us. It's about young Indians. We may not even solve our issues and fall short. But bhai some day the oil will run out and they'll be left with welfare state generation that can't work
9288 2018-03-25 17:31:53 Thanks.  This is the most reasonable articulation I have heard.  I still don’t agree a third way that brings the oil sands out of the ground is a compromise climate activists would find acceptable.

9301 2018-03-25 17:29:36 So the car place that changed my oil, fucked up that little protective plate and we can't even zip tie it up fully because they broke the holes! WTF

9303 2018-03-25 17:29:17 You have probably found out by this time whether you used enough oil. Oiling and flouring the inside of mine matters like whoa.
9304 2018-03-25 17:29:02 Luke for the record you make sone great points but breakpoint for us came around being unable to reconcile you downplaying recent LIBOR-OIS as a sideeffect of the China Yuan oil/Gold contract when in fact it’s representative of global credit/liquidity stress. That seems like bias
9305 2018-03-25 17:28:29 I’ll give you one of my spare baby oil bottles  for them

9307 2018-03-25 17:27:54 Drilled up the Storm Drive and threw yesterday. Had a very controllable break point. Threw it on a dry house pattern yet the ball did not roll out. It still had plenty of energy on the back end. Looking forward to throwing it on heavier oil.
9308 2018-03-25 17:27:04 Like a steak? Olive oil... Oh this is for men...nvm!!!
9309 2018-03-25 17:26:42 Coconut oil girl! I once read that chapstick companies put something in it that makes your lips worse so you buy more of it. Haven’t used any since
9310 2018-03-25 17:26:37 Welll if you use water it will more than likely uncurl. I mean a light spritz of water shouldn’t be that bad also I use a heavy carrier oil so coconut or olive, rub on my hands and pass it through the locs and Black castor oil on the edges. I only use oils in my hair tbh.
9311 2018-03-25 17:26:35 I just ordered the st. Ives exfoliating coconut oil scrub! I hope this goes good to my skin!

9318 2018-03-25 17:26:06 This is terrible! Fathers are supposed to PROTECT their daughters, not force them into marriage or abuse them. If anything, you should pour hot oil on a guy for getting your teenage daughter pregnant, not on your daughter because she doesn't want to get married.
9319 2018-03-25 17:26:05 Extra virgin olive oil is the healthiest fat on the planet.
@Docademic
9320 2018-03-25 17:25:58 alot of groups influence legislation tbh. But I'm taking about like interest groups, lobbyists. Idk about what the oil or auto industry is up to atm lol
9321 2018-03-25 17:25:58 BINGO, this is no different than what big tobacco did trying to hide the dangers of smoking. It is what big oil does in protecting dirty fuel. It is about profits, not public safety.
9322 2018-03-25 17:25:45 Between the NDP and UCP they are both praying for oil revenues to return. If UCP win next election they’ll probably have seen the worst behind them and benefit from larger revenues. Avg citizen will think they did something right when they just got lucky, again.

9340 2018-03-25 17:22:23 Why? Did someone discover more oil there?
9341 2018-03-25 17:22:12 Today at church I received a present  from my sister in the Lord.  She gave me a jar of coconut oil to put on my body for my skin. She told me she and others prayed over the coconut oil so that it will heal me. I sure love my Christian sister. She is awesome!
9342 2018-03-25 17:22:00 So that we don’t pay attention to food and oil companies that have depleted the earth and undercut pretty much everything else.  

That’s how I mean art functions.  It turns attention towards or away things that do matter.  And our capitalist/oligarchy thing depends on this.
9343 2018-03-25 17:21:56 try vitamin e. you can get it in capsules and break them or get a lil bottle of vitamin e oil. best ever for healing skin. sometimes ointments like neosporin slow down the healing process so the wound won’t scar up.
9344 2018-03-25 17:21:35 @buzzfeednifty yo, your discovery story on snap today told people to directly put tea tree oil on their skin which more than likely will cause bad effects for most people. essential oils need to be diluted before being applied directly to the skin.

To get good body smell, clean armpit with lime water.

In the current climate domestically no way we’re going to war with Iran or NK which is the basis of the run from 60 to 66 this week. And if we do in a nuclear world everything crashes

9387 2018-03-25 17:16:54 That's because oil companies are given huge amounts of subsidies by the government. You should be investing in renewable energy more.

9414 2018-03-25 17:12:24 Those 30 are not productive billionaires. They are rent seeking billionaires such as those who were lucky to be around when oil blocs were being allocated which they then held onto for a couple of decades and then sold at a massive return.
9415 2018-03-25 17:12:11 @AnnCoulter As some commentators go, I have often thought there was an occasional functioning mind behind your eyes.

9417 2018-03-25 17:12:09 Yes, I have my concerns with his age (essentially a full year older than others in the tier which is material) and his TOI inflating his numbers.  I’ve just hear the Oil are scouring him very hard.  If he’s there at 8, sure, good pick by I’m not sure about trading up.
9418 2018-03-25 17:12:07 First off, no ones insisting on taking 'all guns'. Second off, if the US government wanted to actually attack us, an entire oil tanker full of nothing but AR-15s and ammo wouldn't be enough--you can't beat jets and tanks with semi-automatic rifles.
9419 2018-03-25 17:11:54 We're set to be the world's largest oil exporter by 2019. They're starting to expand the capacity to export LPG as we've been exporting increasing amounts of coal to our European allies. The US is re-entering the world stage in a very big way.

9509 2018-03-25 16:59:58 Wrong! #Bolton isn't deluded & knows better than many that MEK is deeply hated in Iran (like any cult, clearly MEK has some following over there), implying that what we're seeing in this video is a man telling a paying audience what they want to hear. He is a snake oil salesman!
9510 2018-03-25 16:59:43 Since platypi? platypuses? platypus? idk.  are so odd to begin with, I would be very appreciative of a link, lol. Thank you! And also, I mean, you could euthanize pretty much any animal but apparently this clove oil vid is recommended all over the place and nobody knows why haha
9511 2018-03-25 16:59:35 Nope, popcorn popped in roasted peanut oil. Microwave shows you don't respect yourself.

9515 2018-03-25 16:59:05 I hardly hate prices on stuff but why the oil change for my old ass benz gotta be $100 everytime
9516 2018-03-25 16:58:50 (sub a cup of fine ground yellow corn meal and 2 tablespoons of *corn oil* for a more authentic Chicago style) I don't know how you can make that betters. Good. Luck in that! 
9517 2018-03-25 16:57:30 But it yet another pipeline. I thought you were against all new oil and pipeline instalation. 
9518 2018-03-25 16:57:26 They wanna take away my grandmas pain killers and give her a CANNABIS OIL PEN IM DEAD she gonna be gone 
9519 2018-03-25 16:57:20 Use a fat that can take a v hot oven without burning. Lard / goose fat or rapeseed oil good. 2 eggs, 6 oz plain flour, 10 fl oz skimmed milk. Don’t worry about refrigerating the mix, but do use an electric beater to make sure it’s thoroughly mixed. V hot oven too!

9522 2018-03-25 16:57:03 "I would've helped you with that coconut oil"  cause coconut oil fixes EVERYTHING! #DateMyFamily
9523 2018-03-25 16:56:50 I'm not against wind, solar, EVs or anything. I am against being forced to pay for things like this via govt handouts. I am equally against handing out money to oil companies, farms and basically anyone or anything. ..
9524 2018-03-25 16:56:23 Israel made the decision to end all "diplomatic ties" with Gaza when Hamas was democratically elected in 2007 or was it 2005. irony is that mossad set up Hamas to begin with to weaken PLO in 80s anyways israel made decision to exit & then just BOMBED away why? Gaza has OIL #BDS

9526 2018-03-25 16:56:16 Sweden were policing the Golan heights until a few years ago. Germany are directly involved in four NATO-led wars in which many people would call "Christians stealing Muslim stuff like oil".
9527 2018-03-25 16:55:58 How much more is it gonna take for people to realize Santorum is a snake oil salesman?
9528 2018-03-25 16:55:54 No is not, nobody cares what you say.!
Reason why Israel armed ISIS & Al Qaeda to remove Assad.. Israel was asked to give back the territory, by U.N
but the Gov, decided to take it by force.
Because it has oil.
You can't change the facts. Greedy people!

9537 2018-03-25 16:54:55 Buhari had achieved integrity for him self, he stand as the incorruptible x-president with no oil well or filling station. Ask Ben Bruce to settle #11bill loan he collected. Providing job with the loan that he doesn't know how to yield profit from it. He can't manage simple SBTV
9538 2018-03-25 16:54:31 Not sure if this could be a reason for needing to rebuild our military or not, but on 3/26 China is set to start trading Yuan for oil. A clear move by them to replace the Dollar. Is Trump preparing for War? In the past Countries have been invaded and rulers removed for trying it.

9555 2018-03-25 16:52:16 As for tahini, great to use if you make energy balls in place of nut butter ( better than imo), or with lemon, olive oil and splash of olive oil as a dip/dressing for salad/quinoa....
9556 2018-03-25 16:52:16 TY Danjuma has oil blocks. Bill gates is a very rich man. So what? These does not invalidate their respective opinions in anyway!
9557 2018-03-25 16:52:10 Yeah, they never have to clean up diesel, gas, oil, or damaged batteries from non-Tesla cars. Diesel and gas never catch on fire like that time a live stringer sat on side of road waiting for someone to hit a disabled car instead of trying to warn and slow down oncoming traffic.

9564 2018-03-25 16:50:58 They are running another pipeline parallel to the existing line.  They are doing it as much to the fact the lower mainland requires more oil to meet its own demands.  The oil tankers are not going away.  You will see more traffic into Vancouver no matter what
9565 2018-03-25 16:50:45 Converted the chickpea pasta into a Breakfast Food by frying an egg in the finishing oil. A+ recommend.
9566 2018-03-25 16:50:44 Really? Haha I feel. There's this one weird ass video that pops up in my recommended every year or so- it's on how to humanely euthanize a fish using clove oil. Like wtf, I don't even have fish.

9569 2018-03-25 16:50:23 I’ll probably end up staining my dresser with oil instead of painting it, it costs about the same and I’d rather give it a nice reddish dark brown wood look

9573 2018-03-25 16:49:55 I finally decided to try this coconut oil on my hair and now all I want is a pina colada but I can't have any alcohol on this medication  damn it all

add 15-20 fresh bay leaves to a bath & let the bath fill .  the water will turn light greenish .

bay leaves in water produce an oil which  relaxes muscles and & relieves body of pain & tension .
9579 2018-03-25 16:49:06 Hey Jerry I’m glad someone replied bcs I know lots of my people must disagree w me abt this and I am perplexed. Industry is a distinct concept from oil sands IMO bcs of climate change.  Also new oil sands jobs will be automated so maybe not great for workers either.

Eating tons of pastured eggs, fish, raw home-made Kefir, grass-fed butter, coconut oil, olive oil, etc.
9597 2018-03-25 16:46:32 It's not oil that the pipeline would transport. It's bitumen. Through a pipeline, it has to be liquid, risking spills. By rail, it would be undiluted, aka a solid, so risk of spills is zero.
9598 2018-03-25 16:46:31 If Oil is the only thing holding up the market, we’re in for a helluva toboggan ride.

9603 2018-03-25 16:45:52 Bread spoils. WTI-grade oil would be a fine thing to export & my position is that oil co's should put this country in a position to make it before we allow for a pipe to China.
They'd much prefer to make it there, cuz they don't care about you.

9649 2018-03-25 16:39:10 I still have no idea what they want besides a gun ban and for bad guys to not shoot people. Is this their message?
9650 2018-03-25 16:39:09 Nooo! This is worthy of oil popped or air popped corn! I'm not sure a "Stormy Cocktail" or beer? Red or white wine?
9651 2018-03-25 16:39:05 Big issues with supply for Propane but ours is just heating oil.
9652 2018-03-25 16:38:57 This is an extremely dishonest ad. This bill takes affect in the year 2040 - where will Barbara be then? Most apartments will likely have electric charging stations by then. 

Are you people getting $$ from big oil for being purposefully deceptive?
9653 2018-03-25 16:38:47 なんてこった！梅田が勝った！
9654 2018-03-25 16:38:40 You may not like it but under Gadafi everyone had a job there was oil flowing freely no jihadi muslims and the region was relatively quiet .
9655 2018-03-25 16:38:33 Thankfully I don't have the truck and we just bought a $180 oil painting at the Jax arboretum.
9656 2018-03-25 16:38:15 HELLO !! Anybody see the price of oil and gas the last couple of weeks ?

9659 2018-03-25 16:37:48 And same man got rewarded with oil block and now he just said what many of us have been saying for long.

9661 2018-03-25 16:37:47 You are not a news organization. You are a propaganda machine. If you are so America first why are not all of your products made in the USA? Go sell your snake oil somewhere else!

9664 2018-03-25 16:37:26 No because those insurance function as REAL Insurance. People don’t want to use them. I don’t use my car ins to put oil in my car but your employees want their health ins to pay for every freaking hangnail and thus BUCAs happy to raise rates.
9665 2018-03-25 16:37:23 Typically having the wrong size gears next to each other. But also not using enough oil
9666 2018-03-25 16:37:20 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!

9668 2018-03-25 16:36:59 i put too much oil in my hair
9669 2018-03-25 16:36:54 Was reading this along with all of the recent news.  Price of oil is going to skyrocket.  Market won't react until it happens.  But it's coming
9670 2018-03-25 16:36:40 I needa oil change and my car detailed  imma have to wait til next freakin Saturday 
9671 2018-03-25 16:36:29 Really? Pissing on the Alamo is worse than forcing teen to marry...beating her with broomsticks, pouring hot oil on her?
9672 2018-03-25 16:36:14 @StanleyCohenLaw Time to be honest all Potuses  from the beginning  have been crooks catering to the rich railroad  men oil men or whatever.Lying to the people then when leaving making  tons of money.Big difference  in this one he can't  even wait tell he is out of office .
9673 2018-03-25 16:36:08 Hmmmm. Higher than 88% I suspect and note how the Scot Eng fishing border is different from the oil one
9674 2018-03-25 16:35:55 Shell and other oil companies should be responsible enough to do the right thing.let the rule of law stand.
9675 2018-03-25 16:35:53 Deliverable Yuan Denominated Oil Contract begins trading in Shanghai tomorrow, 3/26/18. What now, Petrodollar? Time to do a Qaddafi on Xi Jinping? WW III?
9676 2018-03-25 16:35:39 I'm trying to reproduce my local café's amazing vegan bran muffins. I think I just have to up the amount of coconut oil and applesauce I use, and switch to a non-dairy milk.
9677 2018-03-25 16:35:38 Not Just airport, Drs offices, hospitals(I’m a nurse), even the station I get my oil changed in my car.
9678 2018-03-25 16:35:21 And shut down nukeclear powerplants and oil industry to switch to clean technology so we can avoid a oil disaster and nukeclear meltdown from nukeclear powerplants. Solar and wind and electric way with the future.
9679 2018-03-25 16:35:19 Saddam Hussein was threatening to trade oil outside of the US Dollar. Gudaffi threatened the same thing. We eliminated both, which helps the US profit and gives us increased national security.
9680 2018-03-25 16:35:10 Fucking hurts when you’re cooking and the boiling oil spits back at you
9681 2018-03-25 16:35:06 Feels like they should be vegetarian/vegan for whatever reason, but doesn’t quite have the sticking power to go through with it full time so eats the occasional pulled pork burger with avocado and truffle oil?!?
9682 2018-03-25 16:34:42 When we make our own organization with beaches and olive oil

9684 2018-03-25 16:34:31 You got that Detroit rear diff locker so it’ll be alright. They don’t require any gear oil. A shot or two of Copenhagen spit and 2 sweettarts, next thing you know your doing 280mph southbound on I81 North.
9685 2018-03-25 16:34:30 I’ll let you know. Cooking this for the first time. I marinated it overnight in a mixture of olive oil, garlic, lemon peel, rosemary, mint and laverbread. I’ll add honey to the jus. It’s in the oven and smells great
9686 2018-03-25 16:34:28 リプ返すの追いつかんごめんなさい>_<
9687 2018-03-25 16:34:18 Turkey is ISIS , they armed ISIS the sold ISIS oil,they gave them treatment when injured and let the have rest and recuperation in Turkey why do this if they didn’t support ISIS , now they are attacking they people who fought ISIS , good luck to the Kurds , boycott Turkey
9688 2018-03-25 16:34:15 Shea butter, or cocoa butter. Both are less greasy than coconut oil, unless your skin needs the extra oil. Get something with vitamin E in it, and if you *can* find it, beeswax is also good. It really depends on *why* your skin is dry tho... 

And just keep drinking water.
9689 2018-03-25 16:34:08 I want to start using oil paints. Not sure if I'll be comfortable with it though, because according to my second mum (Art Teacher) it's a very hard media to control, plus I usually only use traditional acrylics and pencil so idk... who knows I might find it amazing though. Idk...
9690 2018-03-25 16:34:06 It's not hate, I really enjoy Joe Rogans podcast.
But giving Alex Jones any platform, friends or not, and then saying he's actually a great guy is simply wrong.
Alex Jones is nothing more than a snake oil salesmen that promotes hate.
9691 2018-03-25 16:33:49 Vitamin E oil and Glycerin. They really good during winter
9692 2018-03-25 16:33:47 Who loves essential oils but is not affiliated with an essential oil company ?
9693 2018-03-25 16:33:46 Just look at what is happening in Venezuela THIS YEAR.  Socialists have taken total control of the country. They have killed MANY citizens. They have taken control of ALL the oil companies.  WELCOME TO SOCIALISM 101. Take guns away from citizens who can FIGHT THESE COMMIES.

9698 2018-03-25 16:32:34 Danjuma is perhaps the only honest thief in Nigeria; he confessed to stealing N1bn oil block through Abacha though without restitution. Now is telling us to do the 'needful' self-defence.

9699 2018-03-25 16:32:21 Fun fact: coconut oil taste bangin on English muffins/ toast & is so much healthier than butter
9700 2018-03-25 16:32:17 Ooh it looks like an oil painting!
9701 2018-03-25 16:32:07 “See if I pure cooking oil in my petrol cap do u think it’d still go. Be saving the economy”
9702 2018-03-25 16:31:58 Yes, the oil sands are bitumen. But not tar. "Tar like" isn't tar. There is no tar in bitumen or oil sands. Tar comes from coal.
9703 2018-03-25 16:31:52 The Illuminati run the world WAKE UP, IT’S BREAKFAST TIME!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

9705 2018-03-25 16:31:37 Apple Sauce is a great egg substitute! Also oil depending on the recipe. And all nut/soy milks work great as subs for cow 
9706 2018-03-25 16:31:30 Omg  you look like you smell like coconut oil with a touch of vanilla 
9707 2018-03-25 16:31:29 What has TY Danjuma done for Nigeria? He killed Ironsi and many Igbo officers. He  got oil block free of charge for that. 

And you want us to dance azonto that he is now saying what many of us has been saying since many years?

Good morning TY Danjuma, you just woke up.

I'm not sure how you measure that. There are 39 so-called hot wars in the world right now and all the ones involving muslims are Western nations occupying them and stealing their oil, gold and resources.

9741 2018-03-25 16:27:53 Imo, it's the same thing as someone saying Matthews is nearly as good as McDavid. It's just not the case. Great player but the two are on different levels.
9742 2018-03-25 16:27:49 How to tell you've not cooked eggs for a while;

you overestimate the amount of olive oil you needed, then put into the pan...then realize it when you've already poured in the eggs.

Oh well.
9743 2018-03-25 16:27:45 Having olive oil in your ear is the weirdest sensation lol

9746 2018-03-25 16:27:35 Oga Muhammad Jamiu, how I wish you are one of the residents of the isolated areas of conflicts. You ran from rampaging herdsmen into the hands of men in uniform only to find betrayals. Would oil wells matters then
9747 2018-03-25 16:27:22 Something with lavender oil should work 
9748 2018-03-25 16:27:11 Make sure to check your maintenance/owners manual for the actual mileage at which you should change your oil. Most newer vehicles are around 7,500 miles. If you get full synthetic and change every 3,000 you're basically paying twice as much twice as often as needed.

9753 2018-03-25 16:26:18 State ownership of their oil facilities has worked out well also.
9754 2018-03-25 16:26:13 Yup.
9755 2018-03-25 16:26:13 The gen hasn't been on for a week cause my Dad has been trying to call someone to change the oil. We all know how to change oil in the house but because the gen is new Dad doesn't want us touching it.

9760 2018-03-25 16:25:22 No reason she can't change oil.
9761 2018-03-25 16:25:17 It just some people hear 'vegetable oil' & think that's all they need to know to know it environmentally friendly when that isn't the case. Some are & some aren't
9762 2018-03-25 16:25:15 That is where I think the guys on HNIC misspoke. No question he's an elite scorer, the numbers are there to prove it, but that doesn't put him into the same class as a guy like Ovi on the finishing front.

9786 2018-03-25 16:22:31 Fish & Wildlife kill over 200 Million animals a year, BLM uses the same agenda for special interests of Ranchers Oil, Mining & Hunters. The people that run these agencies are chosen purposely for their psychopathic bloodlust, the whole agency needs to be reorganized
9787 2018-03-25 16:22:14 There really should be a class or classes that go over basic first aid, how to register to vote, how your credit score works, how to read a loan agreement, what apr is and how it works, how to change the oil and tires on your car, etc.

9790 2018-03-25 16:21:44 Rachel Notley has no clue of where this junk going thru the Kinder Morgan pipeline is being shipped again shipped to and processed to be sold back to Canada at a higher rate then if we did the processing. My other factors cause the price hikes as the oil companies not Alberta.
9791 2018-03-25 16:21:27 I have friends that cook with avocado oil.
9792 2018-03-25 16:21:22  I thought coconut oil is great for everythingggg

9794 2018-03-25 16:21:10 Not a supporter of current Iranian regime but very much a supporter of Iranian people. Remember Iran had an elected socialist secular Gov before the US/UK coup imposed the Shar for oil. Had they been left alone they would now be a capalist country. No doubt about it.
9795 2018-03-25 16:21:05 It boils down to a fight for control of oil.

9800 2018-03-25 16:20:25 So many great tips being given...... Understand your market and target it. Don't stock things just because you like them, stock them because you've done your research on your footfall etc

It’s been a tough morning....
9802 2018-03-25 16:20:12 There’s an article that told how wealthiest places are not oil fields/diamond mines. Wealthiest places are cemeteries. Buried are businesses never formed,songs never sung, books never written,potential never realized, dreams never came to pass

9804 2018-03-25 16:20:02 And where do those "billions" come from how are they generated is maybe through, scottch whiskey, oil from the shore off scotland,many many oher exports & imports that do not pass through scots ports, cause everything has to go through london,utill we take control it will remain

9806 2018-03-25 16:19:50 I know I'll sound like a kook but bare with me: The Great NATO invasion of Iran will happen around the next 15 when another recession will be in due and oil hitting it's peak. They will first (our current stage) demonize, then destabilize, then invade, but ultimately fail, Iran.
9807 2018-03-25 16:19:46 Yes they can and they are now. In the mean time we give our oil away to the US for almost nothing because we can't get ours to tide water. That's what the Rockefellers wanted from the very beginning when the started the tides, Sierra movements , it's nothing about clean air/water
9808 2018-03-25 16:19:41 Aku sih berasa bgt berkurang redness sm acne scar nya pake rosehip oil setiap malem di step paling akhir. Trilogy or the ordinary si uda coba tp aku prefer the ordinary. Lbh murah, walopun trilogy tekstur nya thicker than TheO tp secara result ga beda jauh....

9810 2018-03-25 16:19:40 No I just mean it's weird that a guy can have 40 goals and not be considered elite just because his skill is so high that he generates more opportunities to convert with an average shooting percentage.

9819 2018-03-25 16:18:24 It’s amazing the amount of climate deniers there are in Canada who feel we have a God-given right to continual expansion of the oil sands. We are not nearly as progressive or informed as we think we are. Media plays a role in this. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

9824 2018-03-25 16:17:46 Just saw a Tesla with a license plate that said “0 emissions.” Yes true, but what about those power plants burning coal/oil/nuclear fuel to produce the power you charge with? They have zero emissions too I’m sure. Just a thought. Onward and upward
9825 2018-03-25 16:17:37 @realDonaldTrump Please check out the rip off from the oil companies in sale of gasoline in this nation. The other day it was 2.459 and later about an hour it was 2.699 at the same station. Why are we Americans being rip off. Thanks foe listening.

9828 2018-03-25 16:17:23 Kendra wisdom of the day:                  “I read that eating two pieces of pizza is equivalent to eating three spoonfuls of oil. But if you think about it, our bodies are like engines and engines need oil to run. So really we need pizza to survive.”
9829 2018-03-25 16:17:23 yeah i peel on the bridge and nostrils too. my pores are biggest there so if i use too much oil the skin is good but the pores are out of control. usually i just extra moisturize there before foundation :/

9852 2018-03-25 16:14:06 It’s far past time we as parents educate our children that guns don’t kill! Wake up before it’s to late. Steps like raising the age, banning certain types, are all just steps to Ban guns. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, We as American gun owners must start squeaking Louder!
9853 2018-03-25 16:13:48 She finishes up the pasta and puts on a pot of water to boil. She then grabs the olive oil and grated cheese. Kara chops come garlic and finds the hot pepper flakes mixing the ingredients together in a shallow plate.

9867 2018-03-25 16:12:49 Gosh so true!  I remember sitting in front of the TV, indian-style with a big giant bowl of popcorn - you know the one that your parents made over the stove in a big pot with oil, and eating every kernel like like I was watching the best movie in the world!
9868 2018-03-25 16:12:19 Time will tell. We needed the military money most of all, even tho it seems like other issues are more important. Don't think for a moment that China wouldn't like to own us 100%. Look at the hate created by past presidents. The wars for oil.

9872 2018-03-25 16:12:04 Perhaps Germany isn't paying it's fair share to NATO. I agree they should, but also remember Germany and Poland are on the front line against possible Russian agression. Don't think the US wouldn't buy oil from Russia? America is a net importer of oil because it uses so much.
