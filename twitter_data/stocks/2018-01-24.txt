4 2018-01-24 23:56:17 It is way to late to try to un-invent the gun, and gov't is too inept to try to control them. 

As to bump stocks, what good is trying to control them when they can be replaced by a simple rubber band or a belt loop?

16 2018-01-24 23:52:40 #Stocks,#Indexes As noted, we sold but did not short. And we will not short NDX. We also may not short SPX. While the core top signal criteria are met by the SPX signal, it paradoxically also bears enough flaws to drive one nuts!
The safest prediction is SPX will not rise.

42 2018-01-24 23:48:28 @PressSec hey sarah kids shooting up fellow students isn't a crime wave nor is it about gangs ! Alexander absolutely right! what is #Trump s policy position on guns - oh btw ... bump stocks still being sold on internet ---- you can run but you can't hide #LiarLiarPantsOnFire
43 2018-01-24 23:48:16 #Stocks,#Indexes As noted earlier, NDX did not generate a top signal. But we generalized from the SPX signal. This goes against usual procedure since in the past only the index that top-signaled declined significantly. This signal, however, looks like it will affect both indexes.
44 2018-01-24 23:47:23 You are so learned, what laws should we place.  It’s hard not to be reactionary when children are dying.  Up to now, there has been noting done, however.  Bump stocks are still legal despite countless deaths.
45 2018-01-24 23:47:09 No one is asking responsible ppl to give up their gun that they want to protect their home and family or to hunt.. there is no need for these semi automatics and bump stocks
46 2018-01-24 23:44:54 @pennylicious99 
I like penny stocks. I like trends and patterns with an uptick. I don't care about bottoms. I care about candles and upticks.Volume and sentiment matter in
47 2018-01-24 23:44:27 Let's start the dialog with these  not vague talking points

Mental Health
Bum Stocks
No Fly list but you can buy a gun
Purchasing of a firearm in another State
Purchasing ammunition in another state
Carrying a firearm within 1000 ft of a school

Do you want me to keep going...
48 2018-01-24 23:44:27 ugh I hate studying in the business library, all anyone in there ever talks about is selling their families for money, and that love is irrelevant when you've got stocks...
49 2018-01-24 23:43:52 He's going to have a great Prison Life.Inmates LOVE Child Molesters & Rapists.Hope he stocks up on Vaseline.Highly doubt he'll last 5 Years.
50 2018-01-24 23:42:56 Canadians hate Americans to the point where the belief that the big bad US is responsible for all the wrong in the world and Canada is the only morally just place left. Give me a break. Canadian Cannabis stocks are a joke, and Canada has a lot to learn from companies in the US
51 2018-01-24 23:42:02 If you try to evaluate these stocks on earnings/fundamentals, then you would have never bought it. I've heard this same argument/question since $ACB was $2, and $WEED was $8

If the chart points up, I invest. I sold $WEED at $14 in 2016, got it back at $8 in 2017, and so on
52 2018-01-24 23:41:31 #5kto25K  The challenge is a lot tougher then I thought but I know it can be done if I focus on less stocks. Were back over $5100 from resting around in the $3200 area. So 70% off bottom , now I need to build on the 5k and get 70% and that would take me to $8500. BABA winner !
53 2018-01-24 23:40:53 I just layed out a few, people on terrorist watch lists shouldnt be able to purchase a firearm, bump-fire stocks should be illegal as they are a loophole that violates the fully automatic weapons ban
54 2018-01-24 23:40:28 Is there a restaurant in town where I can get a Big breakfast?
55 2018-01-24 23:40:28 I’m a huge MSU supporter/alum. It looks like leadership dropped the ball on the Nassar abuse. Anybody remotely involved deserves to lose their job, from the president of MSU down to the guy who stocks the athletic tape if they had any idea what was happening and took no action
56 2018-01-24 23:39:39 A number of specific ideas have been introduced including banning bump stocks, closing gun show loopholes, standardizing background checks. To me the idea that "Democrats want to ban all guns" sounds like your emotion rather than fact-based response.
57 2018-01-24 23:39:10 I bought some stocks today..  making soup tomorrow....now that s investing!
58 2018-01-24 23:39:07 Any reason you moved quickly to ban bump stocks, using the Vegas shooting as basis, without any police report on what happened at Vegas?
59 2018-01-24 23:38:36 He has done nothing but improver this Country . If not the shooting The Left would just find something else to gripe about . Do you understand why the Stock Market is breaking records ? If you own stocks you should be happy
60 2018-01-24 23:37:24 何もやらずに寝てしまった...普通にやばい
61 2018-01-24 23:36:18 If bump fire stocks were illegal than the vegas shooting could have been prevented or at least mitigated, if people on a terrorist watch list couldnt purchase firearms then Omar Mateen couldnt have walked into a store and bought one
62 2018-01-24 23:36:14 So many international sector plays emerging every day. Easy to just play Emerging market and Commodity ETF's. Theme for this year looks to be commodities and international stocks.
63 2018-01-24 23:35:25 #Stocks,#Indexes 2018 PERFORMANCE: SPX: 2841-2683=+5.9%; NDX: 6923-6810=+1.7%; OVERALL: 7.6% + 3.4% (cumulative before today) = +11.0%
64 2018-01-24 23:34:11 get into stocks...trust me
65 2018-01-24 23:33:54 This is for stocks (70%) and crypto (88%).  But it’s the 80/20 rule. 20% of trades will make most of profit.  All about sizing.  Trickiest thing to get right.
66 2018-01-24 23:33:41 I stated what I wanted; mandatory lock boxes.  I also would like to see laws preventing domestic abusers and the mentally ill from obtaining guns.  I’d like to see bump stocks outlawed as well as the loop holes at gun shows closed.  Campaign finance reform would help too.
67 2018-01-24 23:32:33 Idk I just checked my stocks & retirement account .... They are WAY up! 
68 2018-01-24 23:31:58 Recomposición de los stocks de soja. Ya van a salir.

70 2018-01-24 23:30:27 They were all out smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, and installing bump stocks on their AR-15’s.

73 2018-01-24 23:26:46 It’s the stocks for Mercer!
74 2018-01-24 23:26:16 i will always give my stocks to any of my talented friends who will take them so same but the show itself..... my gay time's too precious for them
75 2018-01-24 23:25:37 People on terrorist watch lists can still purchase firearms , bump-fire stocks are still legal in a majority of states. Although they are a band-aid on the issue that US citizens control almost as many firearms as there are citizens
76 2018-01-24 23:24:36 And any books that you recommend for either stocks or options?
77 2018-01-24 23:23:57 Get ready for Inflation, #EEM or #VWO along with #DEM for stocks. #EMLC with #EDD for bonds. Throw in some #FAX for good luck.
78 2018-01-24 23:21:50 Just sold my amazon stocks......I need a tattoo
79 2018-01-24 23:21:40 They might own stocks indirectly; that is different than "investing" with unearned income. Besides, the stock market doesn't drive the economy; consumerism does!
80 2018-01-24 23:21:12 True... but not applicable to all stocks. Its case by case depending on the valuation. Whenever I did that thinking to reenter later.... disappointed as i couldn't see a lower price than my selling price.
81 2018-01-24 23:21:12 @MelissaLeeCNBC you said today that stocks go lower when there are more sellers than buyers. No way.
82 2018-01-24 23:20:57 Reflects my stack and miner stocks going up.
83 2018-01-24 23:20:48 i bailed before those stocks hit the ground but anyone still investing... poor fools
84 2018-01-24 23:20:39 Keyword “New”. Trading stocks, cup and handle for whatever reason was the first pattern I learned in TA. It’s inevitable for new traders to get obsessed about investing at the handle then boom! 99.9% of them aren’t C&H. Lol
85 2018-01-24 23:20:29 BUY Caterpillar ($CAT) Stock!!! Earnings tomorrow! - American Company #MAGA #TrumpTrain #stocks #StockMarket
86 2018-01-24 23:19:54 NZ declares all ICO’s and coins.  As stocks?  Bc that’s EXCELLENT news.  Plays into an outside investor buying them. Which is a long shot. Could happen.  Would be a first.   I’m happy to hear about this.
87 2018-01-24 23:19:37 GOOD!!!! tbh at this point anything is better than my v*ld stocks,
88 2018-01-24 23:19:11 3 school shootings this week. We have to Outlaw bump stocks, assault weapons and close the gun-show loophole. We need to take some action to limit the number of mass shootings in this country. Time is of the essence.
89 2018-01-24 23:18:55 Ah moi j’aime choisir mon produit et puis surtout c’est toujours une fois sur place que je pense à acheter des trucs qui me manquent et auxquels j’avais pas pensé  je fais aussi bcp de stocks pour pas y retourner trop souvent et payer moins cher en grosses quantités.
90 2018-01-24 23:18:40 After some calculations... I only invested 30% of my net income in stocks in 2017... this... is unacceptable... let's push for 50 - 60% in 2018 
91 2018-01-24 23:17:52 Seriously im touched how can unnie can be so nice ;-; omg seems I have sweets stocks here ouo 8D
92 2018-01-24 23:17:43 Local is 25kms, my range 15kms. Never do sole purpose journeys in car. Always check stocks & plan meals before making shopping list. Shop every 15 days. never freeze, always bottle. Plenty of produce, just bad distribution + greedy people. (Don't need oranges, loads other fruit)
93 2018-01-24 23:17:32 Gun owners freak out because the gov want their bump stocks, but don’t give a crap that the gov are taking other people’s health care, abortion rights and so much more? #priorites
94 2018-01-24 23:16:40 Oh, I’m much richer because Trump screw Trumpkins like you and gave all the money to corporations. 
My stocks went up huge, over 10% since beginning of January. 
You moron just keep waiting for your 5 cents raise and $1000 bonus 
95 2018-01-24 23:16:07 And THEN after successful completion of above, they should be permitted a firearm.  Nothing military grade. No bump stocks, no semi automatics etc.  /3
96 2018-01-24 23:15:55 Wednesday's 87 point (-1.1%) fall was the biggest drop seen in FTSE Futures since 15 September 2017, 90 trading days earlier, and was the biggest fall on a Wednesday in the 90 weeks since 4 May 2016 #stocks
97 2018-01-24 23:14:59 And Wal-Mart is one of the super stocks that justifies holding the Nifty Fifty for 20 years or something! I expected that it would've held up better, but it got obliterated.

111 2018-01-24 23:02:01 After reading the term, we should leave now.  Extending the period is just a way of obtaining more money. UK having no input & the EU controlling UK fish stocks. If May agrees to this, she will be gone within months & Conservatives will lose the leave vote.
112 2018-01-24 23:01:59 “it’s kinda like stocks right?”
113 2018-01-24 23:01:41 I don't pretend to know about stocks and other financial business maybe because I never had money left over to buy stocks. But it just doesn't seem good if the value of the dollar drops. Please, can someone explain how that's a good thing?
114 2018-01-24 23:01:30  - you make me giggle so much! I’m naming it the Fishegg “Greenwood” Samdwich. Limited availability while stocks last.
115 2018-01-24 23:01:19 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone on.
116 2018-01-24 23:01:13 European stocks fell on Wednesday, breaking a four-session winning streak as it was yanked lower by strength in the euro.
117 2018-01-24 23:01:09 Nobody, literally NOBODY, is suggesting this. Sensible gun reform is possible. No guns for the mentally unstable, outlaw large clips, bump stocks, and other kits that can be used to make rapid fire weapons. However, it still falls on gun owners to store their firearms safely.
118 2018-01-24 23:00:40 I get free shit everyday from my vote for Hilary. Don't u get free stocks from Dump?
119 2018-01-24 23:00:11 US stocks were mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones producing a triple-digit price swing while the NASDAQ fell as technology stocks came under selling pressure.

121 2018-01-24 22:58:03 @FoxNews @BankofAmerica @GerriWillisFBN

The upper age range mentioned was 37. When I was 37 I had saved way more than $100k. I had saved (stocks, 401K, CDs) way more than $100K at age 30.
122 2018-01-24 22:57:15 i love u also i hope ur stocks plummet this year xoxo @realmadrid 
123 2018-01-24 22:57:07 You’re with them by approving bump stocks, silencers, no background checks... gotcha
124 2018-01-24 22:57:07 No jobs. Companies are buying their stocks back.
125 2018-01-24 22:55:57 Would be interesting to compare broker data against stockhead articles as they ramp and downramp stocks
126 2018-01-24 22:55:44 effect even will go deeper (when this madness reverses). just finished galbraith on 1929 crash. stocks of sound companies were being liquidated b/c the bad companies‘ shares didn‘t find a bid anymore #GreshamsLaw at work -> will put everybody at risk regardless of soundness #sick
127 2018-01-24 22:55:25 True story. These stocks of popcorn in pantries 
128 2018-01-24 22:54:51 I know it’s ~the modern era~ and all that but is it too much to ask that just one of the three stationery shops in my town stocks writing paper so I can send cute letters to my friends?
129 2018-01-24 22:53:45 I completely agree with you on the bump stocks. All fully automatic weapons have been illegal, without a very specific and hard to obtain license, since 1986 though.
130 2018-01-24 22:52:24 I discovered recently that my favorite grocery story stocks cricket flour in their bulk aisle. Tweeps, what should I make with powdered crickets???

150 2018-01-24 22:39:36 Breaking (5:39 PM EST): Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: WHR, LRCX & more... -- CNBC
151 2018-01-24 22:39:12 But what if we move closer from the sub-par growth we’ve had for 8 years to something more similar to trend? You don’t think that’s what’s happening in stocks? Come on you’ve been bearish for like 2 years!
152 2018-01-24 22:38:42 - can somebody school me onto stocks and trades ?

154 2018-01-24 22:37:29 Thank goodness! I’m down 20% already. IBD says to sell at 8% loss but I held. It’s not even in IBD’s top stocks. #bagholder

158 2018-01-24 22:35:27 100%. Even stocks with great news go down same day, and I’m like “here we go again...”.  $sx has contaminated everything.  It’s like a nuclear explosion; nobody is completely unscathed. $sx is poison. It represents all that is wrong and evil in the markets.

179 2018-01-24 22:26:03 Stats like these are totally misleading

Yes if you happened to have bought Best Buy beginning of 2013 (the stocks low point of last 10 years) and held, then its technically true. 

But if you pick any other point since Amazons IPO, it will have outperformed

182 2018-01-24 22:25:22 It is not regulated enough, bump stocks should be illigal, all assault weapons should be banned that's including semi-automatic and automatic from civilians.

186 2018-01-24 22:20:21 Remember, folks: US opposition to chemical weapons -- which the US still stockpiles, in spite of having promised to destroy its stocks by 2012! -- is not 'moral'. It's simply because CWs are *a deterrent against US invasion* that's *available to poor and non-nuclear states*...
187 2018-01-24 22:20:16 Yeah we all have stocks, Idiot
188 2018-01-24 22:19:18 Either that, or this is all a plan to make us even bigger laughing stocks than we already are!
189 2018-01-24 22:19:18 A surprise Fed Funds hike wouldn’t do anything. Might even take stocks higher. Accelerating b/s reduction (draining reserves) would tighten.

196 2018-01-24 22:14:23 I wonder how many Ford cars they have, you know? Like do they like to drive their cars. Could you ask them which is their favorite? Also, why does leather smell like that? Is it from chemicals or no? #ford #cars #GoAvsGo #stocks #Lamborghini #questiontime

200 2018-01-24 22:12:11 You can also look up stocks and you will see that the majority of renewable companies have pathetic earnings when comparing to fossil fuel. Are you saying the Florida tax payer is paying for solar projects?
201 2018-01-24 22:11:44 Because only 48% of Americans own or invest in stocks. And 80% of those are the very wealthy. Stocks do nothing to help most middle income and all low income Americans.
202 2018-01-24 22:11:04 He is confused by bump stocks and stock bumps.

224 2018-01-24 21:53:34 Vote no for another Trump" hatchet man" to sabotage healthcare help pharma to raise prices more so he can get a kick back & increasing his stocks n pharma. Make him a No Vote.
225 2018-01-24 21:52:21 Yglesias’ point is that United’s plan to increase capacity is good for consumers, as it may lead to lower prices. But markets slammed airline stocks because the price drop might make the industry more competitive but less profitable.
226 2018-01-24 21:51:50 It's 100% true, they had their parents mortgage the house and lend them the $, they invested it all in FANG stocks   ... free money being given away in the stock market

231 2018-01-24 21:46:55 Hey Skippy, If you had real things (401k, stocks, a mortgage), instead of imaginary things and bags of weed, you might view politics and the economy differently
232 2018-01-24 21:46:47 So what?  Why should us 20%ers be punished just because the bottom 80% are too stupid to invest their money properly?  If you're so jealous, then go buy some stocks.
233 2018-01-24 21:46:25 Well no because trumps policies have created wealth through growing value of stocks, so you can viable credit him for that
234 2018-01-24 21:45:15 $LTBR could be a big breakout over 4 area ...5 to 6 imo
235 2018-01-24 21:45:15 I haven't seen anything but with a rising economic growth and low unemployment and rising stocks it wouldn't take much to find someone who has. Just because I don't see results on a personal level doesn't mean that there isn't good and growth going on.
236 2018-01-24 21:44:53 Stocks are going to plunge soon. Mueller is getting closer to TRUMP. Rumors of dozens of sealed indictments. Unclear if a sitting president can be indicted in office, but can be indicted the moment term is up. #MoneyLaundering

242 2018-01-24 21:43:59 TA in crypto is only best if you trade on coins you don’t really believe it will  go up or is not brand new to the market. Tokens like @adex and @flixxo @ethlend1 are tokens that are based on fundamentals. Treat and see them like stocks. But also Hold them like gold.

245 2018-01-24 21:42:41 We do nothing. Gun show selling bump stocks in Las Vegas this very week. NRA blocked CDC from doing research into gun incidents. No federal database. What can we do? LOTS!!!!
246 2018-01-24 21:42:14 More empty rhetoric. Won’t institute strict background checks for all; won’t ban high capacity magazines or bump stocks; won’t require training and licensing...; won’t do anything but “pray” for the victims! And, of course, accept money from the NRA!

249 2018-01-24 21:41:35 A few months after the deadliest mass shooting in America’s history, bump stocks and your Congress’s vote are still up for sale. @nra owns those it endorses.  You can be pro-2nd amendment and anti-NRA! @SenateMajLdr @ConorLambPA
250 2018-01-24 21:41:26 Thoughts and prayers from POTUS today regarding the Kentucky shooting which means there will be no action taken. While we wait for our prayers to be answered how about addressing some low hanging fruit and make bump stocks illegal today or have we forgotten Vegas? #GunControlNow
251 2018-01-24 21:41:12 UAL announced a supply expansion so all the airlines stocks tanked, on fears that there will be a price war.

What this has to do with passive funds (or whatever Matt was claiming about capitalism being broken) is unclear.
252 2018-01-24 21:41:07 What about destroying Atlantic City? Google it. Aside from the people who worked for him he didn't pay, also wiped out small businesses. Taj Mahal stocks dropped 93%. He's going to do to America what he did there.
253 2018-01-24 21:41:00 If only 1/2 the stocks owned weren't by foreign investors. That's only $4 trillion to the US economy.
254 2018-01-24 21:40:22 Someone should let people know, Bump Stocks are used offense, not defensive weaponry.

257 2018-01-24 21:39:16 @FoxBusiness Kimberly-Clark to cut 5,000 to 5,500 jobs. How will @FoxNews report that. They haven't reported the thousands that are being laid off. Top phone company giving employee stocks, no cash, while closing 160+stores.  @Forbes @GOP @SenateGOP
258 2018-01-24 21:38:32 I understand nothing in this thread beginning with what's happening in airline stocks today
259 2018-01-24 21:38:31 The top five stocks that gained today were $GWW, $NAVI, $GD, $FAST, and $NFLX.
260 2018-01-24 21:38:05 Healthcare companies stocks have quadrupled under the ACA and the government still gives them billions in subsidies!
261 2018-01-24 21:37:34 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $F, $AAPL, and $CMSCA.
262 2018-01-24 21:36:55 Orange Roughy sustainable, are you sure, it’s biology suggests otherwise? Stocks are recovering but not to sufficient levels as current data suggests. Do you have supporting data proving its sustainability as a suitable alternative? Please share...
263 2018-01-24 21:36:39 Airline stocks crash this afternoon...wonder if they are beginning to realize airlines have become a commodity. Increased competition erodes margins over time...can only cut costs for so long
264 2018-01-24 21:36:37 is WATT going to run back up after this equity offering?

265 2018-01-24 21:35:10 $LTBR nice so far ...holding overnight
266 2018-01-24 21:34:56 Hate when my stocks move more than my #crypto
267 2018-01-24 21:34:26 I’ve been investing in stocks lately it’s pretty interesting frankly if u like playing wit numbers I personally like getting into it when I’m blazing 
268 2018-01-24 21:34:10 Except while crude has doubled in two years exactly the oil related stocks and funds have lagged significantly so...
269 2018-01-24 21:32:13 You trade options ir stocks?
270 2018-01-24 21:31:47 Can't believe brazil stocks as tracked by the $ewz is up over 6 percent due to Lula conviction; #brazil has a good long term future if they continue to rout out corruption & focus on growing the middle class & harness the growing demand of agricultural products
271 2018-01-24 21:31:26 $F I see now MM wanted to get in cheap on one of the only cheap stocks out there, so they made it be dumped.. non event
272 2018-01-24 21:31:07 Yes we all stand with the families of this senseless tragedy but what have you or congress done to move on sensible gun ownership reform.  Nothing and still nothing on bump stocks either.  Shame on us all.
273 2018-01-24 21:30:42 Our recommendations on big brands to invest in that are not done growing by no means! #Tesla and then of course the big F.A.N.G. #Facebook #Amazon #Netflix & #Google ask us why we think so! #invest #stocks #MuskPay #business #goals #savings
274 2018-01-24 21:30:27 World stocks tip downward: Europe -.5%; US -.1%. A sliding dollar & concern about a US catalyzed protectionist spiral concerned investors. Momentum still to the upside & 2018 should show more gains. Foreign stocks sill look superior & bond-proxy stocks still problematic.
275 2018-01-24 21:30:10 Your wrong about Trump, actually the US economy is doing quite well since he took office,  stocks up $8 trillions, lowest unemployment ever
276 2018-01-24 21:30:10 I think you'll need to come up with a list of "Grid Buster" Stocks. Make sure and type up the list and offer to fax them to interested investors.  #oldschooliscool
277 2018-01-24 21:30:07 Yes, please promote, we still have ~150 seats available, should be a great show.  120 pencils would really push our stocks, but could do (say) ten to offer as prizes? Happy to consider future Glos/Worcs if you're keen.
278 2018-01-24 21:29:24 Millennials are flocking to cryptocurrency and cannabis stocks, TD Ameritrade CEO Tim Hockey said in an interview.
279 2018-01-24 21:29:22 Same goes with all the commodity stocks
280 2018-01-24 21:28:40 Not at all. I thought when the stocks and GDP crash after Election Day it would be Trumps fault?
281 2018-01-24 21:28:36 @themotleyfool is missing the competitive edge they are using in a tight market...apps to help transfer funds and amassing crypto that “should” rise in value.  IDL is near its 52wk low and pays a 6% dividend.  Are there better stocks? Sure. But this one may be at a value.
282 2018-01-24 21:27:50 Have you asked who stocks them?
283 2018-01-24 21:26:15 My stocks are killing it though so net net I’ve had a great month so far. Guess we buckle up while all this DC mess shakes out
284 2018-01-24 21:25:15 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-23, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
285 2018-01-24 21:25:04 I told a friend to invest his $100k in 2016 in weed stocks that he saved up. He said he'd rather save it and I understand that, hard to part with hard earned money. Now that he sees how much I made he is texting me saying he wishes he invested. Yea no shit you should have buddy.
286 2018-01-24 21:22:47 @AskRBC why can't I update my email address to receive alerts for stocks I've purchased? So frustrating. Will cause me to miss times to sell with this stupidity. #terribleplatform
287 2018-01-24 21:22:35 I know the feeling. Each day its about 3 stocks down for every 1 up and yet the major indexes keep rising, its baffling.
288 2018-01-24 21:22:33 Been here before:
Remember what happened 2007 
Stocks & home prices new monthly records (just like today)
Yield curve flattening as Fed hiked (just like today) 
Talk of recession risk (same as ever) 
And US Dollar? Collapsing like today
Regardless costly/painful wait @tastytrade
289 2018-01-24 21:21:13 I like $thcx but exited everything and was going to get back in low $4.80's but didn't. Doja is solid with a nice run. If it runs down a bit I'll consider. Side note, i am adding to nat gas stocks for now $bir $bnp and $pony. Keep eyes out on that sector too.
290 2018-01-24 21:20:30 Le prix du pétrole new-yorkais a terminé ce soir à son plus haut niveau depuis décembre  2014 !  Une baisse simultanée du dollar et des stocks américains de brut propulsant le cours malgré une production en hausse aux Etats-Unis.

293 2018-01-24 21:19:24 Guess they figure having Price as HHS sec making money off the position through stocks wasn’t quite a big enough conflict of interest.....
294 2018-01-24 21:18:26 Starting to come around to the thinking of the conspiracy nuts. Think players are just seen as stocks to be bought low and sold high.   

Winning would be great but not the priority.
295 2018-01-24 21:17:33 Best part of having Gold move higher, is watching gold stocks not move.
296 2018-01-24 21:17:21 Luke, do you have any idea what stock valuations were like in the 1940s (and where they are today)? They're at least 4x higher today. If CPI takes off, both stocks and bonds will get crushed vs. CPI.
297 2018-01-24 21:16:55 I dunno we'll see this market is unpredictable , stocks jump 20% with no news..
298 2018-01-24 21:16:28 Des stocks que l’on retrouvera dans les solderies cet été !
299 2018-01-24 21:16:18 I’m putting my Trump stocks in Bump Stocks #bumpstocks
300 2018-01-24 21:16:04 Yes, possibly somewhat priced in at index level. I think many individual stocks will not accurately be reflecting new FX rates.
301 2018-01-24 21:14:47 United announced an expansion plan, which caused airline stocks to tumble because investors think there will be too much competition

303 2018-01-24 21:14:33 Wall street trades Private prison stocks, trades Debt for profit. Debt from personal/consumer debt to complex derivative schemes used to mask the debt of entire countries...That's a perfect example of how capitalism breeds greed. An entirely new level of insanity.
304 2018-01-24 21:13:56 If the Pensions are put in the right Stocks, they may get out of this mess, if the CROOKED Politicians don't find a way to STEAL that Money First!!!

307 2018-01-24 21:12:24 No, what’s been happening to Raytheon stocks for decades is
308 2018-01-24 21:11:23 Lmao this is what you say when you’re screwed, if it doesn’t recover it’s a massive loss 

Dollar is at its weakest since 2014, which doesn’t really bode well for US economy especially when stocks are soaring it shows a vast discrepancy and that we’re inflating the stock market.
309 2018-01-24 21:11:21 Been listening to the Leeds MD tonight saying they wanted something bold and brave, amazing that they only achieved shit

311 2018-01-24 21:10:26 "After firing all of my good writers and making a paywall,
My transformation to a clickbait site is complete.
I lean contendedly in my horse saddle and gaze at the sunset, the golden orbs descent mimicking that of my stocks. I sigh, and ride my horse directly off a cliff."
312 2018-01-24 21:10:17 Yes bean stocks are high, but demand is very strong. If China retaliates and imposes an import tax on our beans , what happens if South America has a bad growing season? Where would China get their beans from? Don’t see China playing games with food supply IMO
313 2018-01-24 21:09:34 @centricaplc 
Centrica. I own a number of shares with you and I loved the dividends last year!
Not loving the current price, but I'm confident you'll bounce back because one of my first ever shares were CNA stocks and I made a nice 10% with my first delve in the Stock Market.
314 2018-01-24 21:08:19 Disappointed my local @asda stocks @AttitudeMag but NOT @DIVAmagazine 
315 2018-01-24 21:08:08 Sean I think he might be right. In an America that remembers its history you & #Trump should be laughing stocks. I fear many of my country men have grown tired of government by, for & of the people, tired of freedom, tired of peace.
316 2018-01-24 21:07:49 $ABCCF $ABCN.V  is the only few in green today among these #marijuana stocks such as  $HMMJ.CA $ACBFF $CMED.CA .
317 2018-01-24 21:07:17 Stocks down 0.01% today
318 2018-01-24 21:07:13 Also the expected outcome of sentencing someone to be left in the stocks overnight.
319 2018-01-24 21:07:10 I learned how to LIE via the current potus! Over 2000 lies in the first yr, cost Americans more in 1 yr of playing GOOFY GOLF, than ALL 8 yrs if OBAMAS FAMILY VAC AND GOLF, NOT TO MENTION OBAMAS STOCKS AT THE END OF HIS 1st yr was HIGHER THAN TRUMPS, 23!!
320 2018-01-24 21:07:08 I don't trade that one. I do either single stocks or call options on single stocks.  All the stocks I like to trade I usually show the charts on here.
321 2018-01-24 21:07:04 Sad thing is, a lot of folk "go left" and take the gaming aspect with them. It's games people, not politics, religion, no stocks, bonds or mutual funds. Play ya games and have fun! Period!

327 2018-01-24 21:05:05 Intresting, Norway did invest serru mutch under Obama. But the last year we stoped investing in oil, and we sell stocks now. Insted er invest in Tesla and solarpanel industry.  You now increas tax on this industry. And we will invest in other contrys insted.

336 2018-01-24 21:01:41 More research & development jobs plus they start acquiring Israeli companies providing even more jobs &more technology region.  Just like most stocks I have been acquiring  when somebody mentions BDS have been acquired now by American or European companies increasing their value
337 2018-01-24 21:01:39 Really? Heard on the news today that Verizon just gave 10% increase to lowest paid and stocks
338 2018-01-24 21:00:52 You bosses own those stocks that means nothing to us you fucking stooge we care more about free education and the 3 universities that Msholozi established, you and your white bosses can celebrate rising stock prices
339 2018-01-24 21:00:22 They don't run checks in all states such as Indiana. Private seller can rent a booth and sell guns without background checks. Not to mention internet sales. Bump stocks are legal to make - illegal to attach to a rifle. Stop manufacturing. Criminal negligence is not enforced.
340 2018-01-24 20:59:58 Fancy trying a pint of Cleethorpes Pale Ale? It’s available on draft in the Settlement Caistor, the Barge Grimsby, Ship Inn Barnoldby Le Beck, Lucarlys & Grimsby Borough, @TaleofTwoBar Cleethorpes.  Finally a big shout out to @MIABCleethopres who stocks all our bottles
341 2018-01-24 20:59:42 Agreed.  These stocks should be up +5%.  Lots of time.  If the commodity keeps going up in their face it will be hard to ignore.
342 2018-01-24 20:58:25 I did. Don't speak for me. My U.S. solar stocks are up because of this.
343 2018-01-24 20:58:09 My goal for this year is to invest at least 5k in stocks
344 2018-01-24 20:57:52 Even if you don’t have stocks, as companies and people make more, they spend more, leave bigger tips, offer better paying jobs. When the tide goes up, ALL boats float. A little time is needed.
345 2018-01-24 20:57:10 

I can't help it, I laugh every time I think of the money these fools lost by selling their stocks before the big CRASH!

351 2018-01-24 20:55:48 We are sick hearing about your thoughts and prayers. Enough already! Where is gun reform? and Why are bump stocks still available? 
I believe in the second amendment, however we shouldn't have access to military grade weapons whose only intent is to cause mass casualties!
352 2018-01-24 20:54:55 I need to open my own wine shop just so I can make sure to carry Orin Swift. No one in this town reliably stocks any of their wines.

When that stock gets cut in half I hope they say "$TSLA collapsing share price confirms stocks can, in fact, move up AND down."
355 2018-01-24 20:53:29 Thoughts and prayers are not enough.  What are you doing to prevent future gun violence? We need better background checks, no high count magazines, no semiautomatic weapons, no silencers and no bump stocks.

358 2018-01-24 20:52:13 What kind of legislation? They already run background checks.
Bump-stocks are already illegal after the Las Vegas shooting.
Criminal Negligence is already a crime.
359 2018-01-24 20:52:06 Yep... that’s my broader point. If value stocks (including financials, utes, etc...) were simply much cheaper, value still could have outperformed with same composition

373 2018-01-24 20:48:08 Well, banning bump stocks would be a start, but can’t even get Congress to do that much. How about a reasonable waiting period, so a proper and thorough background check can occur b4 purchase? Would it kill someone (no pun int’d) to wait a few weeks for their umteenth gun? 1/

Chaos adminstration.
404 2018-01-24 20:30:31 The announcement made IDT gap up this morning on larger than normal volume.

410 2018-01-24 20:28:31 You say you’re with them and yet your Congress has not only squashed a bill to ban bump stocks, but also made it EASIER to obtain firearms and silencers.

432 2018-01-24 20:16:15 I don’t think that’s just since the financial crisis. The original Fama/French paper on value factor from early 90’s throws financial stocks out the window. Has to do with high leverage of financials systematically depressing their P/B ratios.
433 2018-01-24 20:15:25 You keep saying the "Market" these number are for the just dow jones. There are other stocks look into those.

436 2018-01-24 20:13:43 All those brand new masternodes with no exchanges and ridiculous ROIs are pure rubbish. Numbers look attractive but I'd treat them like penny stocks with a very high chance of losing all of your investment
437 2018-01-24 20:13:42 I'm coming across statements of 80 year old retirees owning ultra short vix etfs, gbtc, and 95% tech stocks. The clients don't care because it is working and their advisors say "low risk"

439 2018-01-24 20:12:30 You don’t get what is really happening. Cures are traded like stocks. I grew up with a kid who’s dad got rich off the cure for Hep C, he didn’t invent it, or own the company that did, he bought and traded it, this shouldn’t be happening

441 2018-01-24 20:11:46 "Stocks" seem like a suitable answer.
442 2018-01-24 20:11:44 If a value stocks is dirt cheap vs a growth stock it has a lot better chance of outperforming than if they are priced similarly (otherwise fundamentals matter more). That has been the main issue in my mind the last 10+ years for value. Price, not composition.

449 2018-01-24 20:09:30 In any window, attribution shows relative performance was driven by something (sector, stock, etc...). The bigger picture to me is value works when areas are puked out as bargains, but $$ has been consistently puked out of growth oriented stocks (not value) despite outperformance
450 2018-01-24 20:09:26 Gun locks. Mandated by law. With consequences like confiscation. No military assault weapons for ‘hunting’. No bump stocks. Limit on size of magazines. Universal background checks. No guns for spousal abusers.  LOGIC

486 2018-01-24 19:48:03 There’s no question that the market looks expensive on absolute metrics, such as P/E versus its own history. However, the market can’t be valued in a vacuum. If stocks are worth their discounted cash flows (and they are), then the discount rate is a big component in valuation.

512 2018-01-24 19:37:13 I just invested $10 into stocks and bonds. My money is growing. It's called fractional investing. :)
513 2018-01-24 19:37:12 That has been proven. Things that make no sense to get rid of Trump does simply because Obama’s name was on it. Like the regulation that you can’t lie to someone when doing their stocks to get them to give you money. Protects wall street not the ppl. Trump got rid of it.

525 2018-01-24 19:28:43 People are living vicariously through the judge. But there's a reason not everyone is cut out to be a judge. Just like there's a reason we don't put convicts in stocks in the public square anymore. We could, but at some point, we decided that's not who we wanted to be.
526 2018-01-24 19:28:17 people should also be aware that @WeissRatings has been litigated for Pump and Dump schemes for stocks. In the unregulated crypto markets, there is no doubt in my mind that they are pulling the same scam. INVESTORS BEWARE

530 2018-01-24 19:25:13 That's true - there are loads of Stocks I like but just can't hold everything and some would bring nowt to the Portfolio Party  (or Wake like it was today ;-) ...)
531 2018-01-24 19:25:06 @Chileshe3M  you know you’re in love when you think of buying her stocks and bonds for her 21st birthday 
532 2018-01-24 19:24:56 Stocks
533 2018-01-24 19:24:24 But they get to pay less in corporate taxes. Win win for them...until sales fall and their stocks drop layoffs etc.
534 2018-01-24 19:24:15 If the risk is tolerable this might be a good play for you. If not I think the safer option represents an overal good exposure to the sector with safe dividend (as opposed to choosing individual stocks in said sector). I’ll be holding until they expire (or renew again hopefully)
535 2018-01-24 19:23:54 Natural gas stocks are now buys but hold off on oil stocks, frack stocks and the offshore drillers. These stocks have lots of downside from here.
536 2018-01-24 19:22:51 Right. It's why I'm helping my son purchase his 1st home. I told him he wasn't "allowed" to rent. Buy property. Also helping him build credit by adding him as an authorized user on my credit cards & transferring shares/stocks in companies I've invested in. #PassItOn

539 2018-01-24 19:21:46 Great op-ed, I thought give ATF bump stocks and they will leave us alone, but the piece does have a good point about that. With that I am back to "shall not be infringed". Thanks Jordan!!!
540 2018-01-24 19:21:41 So in conclusion, in my own opinion. Wednesday would be the best day to buy stocks. The majority of the time.
541 2018-01-24 19:21:25 Energy stocks...
$PBR: up over 7%  on abv. avg. volume
$PTR:  up over 4% making a new six month high
542 2018-01-24 19:21:14 And personal defense does not require high capacity mags, armor piercing rounds, bump stocks, etc.

But I'm all for revisiting and updating the second amendment to clear these things up for you nutters. It's long overdue, and other countries manage to get by just fine w/o one

545 2018-01-24 19:20:45 We bot some under $40, then I started to build a bigger posn right around here, adding on pullbacks. It's hard for me to buy stocks this close to fresh highs. But I wanna own it so 
546 2018-01-24 19:19:52 give them bananas instead of dollars they ll keep on buying stocks ,....

552 2018-01-24 19:19:02 Walmart is using 10x more than their giving in bonuses to buyback stocks. 

STOP TRYING TO BUY US OFF WITH OUR OWN CRUMBS.
553 2018-01-24 19:18:47 The weekly EIA report showed a modest decline in crude stocks of 1.1Mb offset by a rise in gasoline inventories of 3.1Mb. #Crudeoil is up on a much weaker dollar as the Treasury Secretary talked down the #currency. WTI is up 88 cents to US$65.35/b.

555 2018-01-24 19:17:53 At midday, MBS lower, off worst levels. Stocks lower after early big gains. 10-yr yield 2.64%.

558 2018-01-24 19:17:23 His solution..put silencers and bump stocks...is he President of NRA
559 2018-01-24 19:17:10 Can not agree more with you !!!
560 2018-01-24 19:16:46 You should also see that these RESTRICTED stocks are not the same as STOCK OPTIONS the executives and management get. They need have specific conditions to be met before payout. Like time employed, worker improvement attendance it could be anything. Why not stock options?
561 2018-01-24 19:16:18 Dekmar is pro pump, lol, he gets in on random low float stocks hoping for them to fly
562 2018-01-24 19:16:04 re: $UAL , I can't believe Mr Market is playing the same game as last Oct'. The 'ohh, a price war is a threat'. Further, the notion higher capacity (as is needed within a growing economy, and yet, that is seen as bearish? Crazy!
563 2018-01-24 19:15:35 I wonder what Spock would say about certain stocks.

566 2018-01-24 19:15:13 U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called China's 2025 technology strategy a "direct threat" and hinted at action against Beijing, stirring fears of a tit-for-tat trade war. The Beginning.....
567 2018-01-24 19:14:49 I suspect that the USD and gold itself are far more widely used by terrorists and oppressive regimes, so the market constantly retreating to those stocks is more likely to provide them profit than the small return from mining of crypto.
568 2018-01-24 19:14:06 I never liked coffee , I get Migraine... But been long in this and hoping I wont get burned in this like $UAL :(

570 2018-01-24 19:12:39 Goldman downgrade it to 18, so people sold it. Simple, now their price target is 18 which well below yesterday level. People buy and sell stocks on news.
571 2018-01-24 19:12:34 Stocks are so over-bought that lower dollar shouldn’t automatically mean higher stocks.

Seriously though, the stock is s/t rolling over, but you'd have to be crazy to be short it ahead of earnings, due Thurs' in AH, yes?  Will add to the list for 7pm.

If USD transition happens quick, stocks continue melt-up. If it draws out over 2020s, then we have one more big crash, possibly starting soon.

587 2018-01-24 19:06:20 I love it when the people I speak to about investing in stocks & bonds & crypto really take initiative and start right away. I spoke with this young kid last month & today he came to me with his created portfolio & said “I’m ready to invest” & began asking me questions right away
588 2018-01-24 19:06:08 Anyone can purchase stocks. 
Job numbers are exploding. 
26,000 regulations removed.
Tax cuts for the middle class, no taxes for the poor.
Lowest black and Hispanic unemployment in history.
Billions of dollars are coming back.

Obama, who I voted for,  didn't come close to Trump.
589 2018-01-24 19:05:09 The latest from @RenMacLLC: Stocks usually go up.

594 2018-01-24 19:04:05 $SPY Time to check your stocks. Any "loser" (weak results/weak guidance) will be slammed as $TXN is @ -8.78% today. Especially if bid up.
595 2018-01-24 19:03:23 Glad that Rangers have stuck to their guns. No room at Ibrox for the two propaganda-peddlers in question. Unless it's in the stocks at half-time.
596 2018-01-24 19:02:10 Look at today's selling of an overbought market as a healthy development as it will give you another opportunity to buy some of the stocks you might have missed the first time around.
597 2018-01-24 18:59:50 The way U.S borrowing to its death & the way $ tanking in FX markets  yes bond yields could spike 1% as Dalio expects! All of my savings in stocks. Nothing in bonds. You don't need bonds if you sell your stocks when you need cash.
598 2018-01-24 18:59:30 I figured XLU would be as risk off, but you’re right on the fact stocks within the index could still be sold off in a correction

642 2018-01-24 18:40:55 lol. note how for some bloggers, "market breaks" is either evidence of manipulation to drive stocks higher or a reason why stocks are lower, depending on the day.
643 2018-01-24 18:40:17 Here is how I find interesting #stocks for #trading:
1. Go trough volume leaders every day.
2. Go trough price leaders every day.
3. Select the technically strongest.
4. Take a quick look behind the story.

644 2018-01-24 18:39:03 the fear of stocks rising is real #omgadownday
645 2018-01-24 18:38:48 So don't control risk or crystallize gains?  Bought stocks were meant to be sold.
646 2018-01-24 18:37:35 It's stocks in a company if you would invest and the company Rises you receive money as a reward for your help
647 2018-01-24 18:36:28 Yes but when you add variables to any equation they change the impact.  With stocks priced > $100/share, forces retailers into margin, and options, which in turn changes the calculus. Why so few stock splits ? lots of manipulation (unfair greed), stock levels/markets are meanglss

651 2018-01-24 18:34:31 The Fed have an agenda to keep raising rates. March is pretty much a done deal. Stocks selling off from all time highs won’t scare them. Not even sure a 5% move would. They think stocks are too high. The weak $ playing into their hands for higher inflation.  I’m focusing on that

721 2018-01-24 18:07:44 True, but it still comes down to effective yields compared to what you can make with, say, quality long-term corporate bonds. Fed is still keeping interest rates (too?) low and this is still propping up stock prices. Now, tax and regulatory environment are better for stocks, too.

811 2018-01-24 17:35:05 This article makes a couple incorrect statements about full-autos and about bump-stocks.  Full-autos are NOT illegal, they do NOT require a permit, and the BATFE has previously ruled that bump stocks do NOT convert a semi-auto to full-auto... it makes a semi EMULATE a full-auto.

I agree that income and wealth inequality is one of the biggest issues we need to address. I'm not sure wiping out wealth is the fix.

826 2018-01-24 17:28:31 My thinking was that your student loan interest is a lot lower than pay-day loans or credit card debt, and similar to what you'd get in stocks. So saving instead of paying it down is like being able to take out a student loan later to fix your car.

908 2018-01-24 17:03:33 You don't have to trade all the time. Stick to your time-frame with iron discipline. If your time frame is weeks to months, you don't need to be trading in and out everyday. Let the trends develop and ride it until it bends. $SPY $UVXY $QQQ $VXX #stocks #trading #study

913 2018-01-24 17:02:40 Point of RSI Analysis: Understand what the odds say about where stocks may be in 6 to 24 months, based on historical facts. 

Said another way, does history tell us "extremely overbought" is a showstopper for long-term bullish trends, which by definition make higher highs?
914 2018-01-24 17:01:59 #DYK the Port of New York was the country’s most prosperous trade center and seaport back in the day? Some would even say it still is, but, instead, of fish and fur we trade stocks and bonds. #SearchingforGold #America #LowerManhattan #NYC

916 2018-01-24 17:01:43 Both gambling. Rate of return and risk is somewhat mitigated in stock market, due to the investment ability. But don't get it twisted both are gambles. Stocks are obviously an exponentially safer bet...

938 2018-01-24 16:54:48 Yeah but he only gets the stocks if he meets the set targets. So if the company goes no where, they spend nothing on him. He’s also not allowed to sell the stocks for 5 years which means he is 100% tied to ensuring short and long term success.
939 2018-01-24 16:54:37 wall street slamming U.S. stocks today notably industrial and technology scamming investors and IRAs, because they can and they didn't get their puppet in office
940 2018-01-24 16:54:17 It's so reminiscent of Dotcom Days when Tech was all the rage and Boring Old Economy Stocks were shunned. That will change at some point and those holding the Tech stuff will feel jealous  ;-)

942 2018-01-24 16:53:30 43% of Americans have private pensions - mostly invested in the stock market. 33% have 401ks. A further 24% have direct investment in mutual fund or stocks. Forget bonuses, forget wage increases, forget the increased hiring - almost ALL of us are becoming wealthier.
943 2018-01-24 16:53:21 Ah nice, I'll have to look that up. Overlap between landed elites/finance capital pretty interesting. Also v interesting in terms of elite schools, their alumni and their financing. Land and stocks still key - most of the big schools have moved towards the latter tho.
944 2018-01-24 16:52:35 Yea, the nat gas producer stocks are saying the price rise is all bullshit. So far...
945 2018-01-24 16:52:26 Dude he's making paper gains. He's not making any money unless he sells his stocks and if he does the stock price would probably plunge.

954 2018-01-24 16:49:03 In Canada the weak USD combined with interest rate increases make the stronger CAD play the same inverse roll with business margins.  This results in the lower market valuation of Canadian stocks and markets.  So it’s all rational.  #stocks #cdnpoli

986 2018-01-24 16:38:13 Also, commercial banks create money with each loan (they don't lend saver's deposits) and lots of loans go to existing assets then this creates inflation too, see stocks, housing market. Since only ~15% of loans are to productive ends, most loans are inflationary.

1078 2018-01-24 16:08:58 I'm not worried about 1 million shares issued one time last year before the PP. That has zero bearing on the momentum imho. I agree there are always pros and cons. Very few venture stocks have sparkling balance sheets. Just the reality.

1082 2018-01-24 16:07:40 My goal this year is to get my feet wet in stocks. Even if it’s just 10 shares.

1085 2018-01-24 16:06:42 2020 seems to be just right, even @RayDalio calling it a late stage in the cycle. With that inflation ticking up, higher rates definitely going to jolt some high leverage stocks in a bad way... Netflix & Tesla one of those, unless equity injections come their way

1090 2018-01-24 16:04:54 agree. Investors will hedge stocks in parabolic acceleration by buying gold.
1091 2018-01-24 16:04:48 Sometimes you have to just use them like they use the public. When #stocks make big moves & they miss , They knock them down in order to take a position . Buy VRX. I like FNSR But i own LITE
1092 2018-01-24 16:03:41 I'd like to see these sources on this as well. I don't care about Trump's past. I've seen he's doing pretty good so far. Stocks up, more jobs, major companies offering bonuses to low level employees.

1107 2018-01-24 15:59:25 rotated out of gold and into global stocks today. breakevens have reflated enuff and the real rate curve is too asymmetric (i.e., exposed to a faster tightening).

1111 2018-01-24 15:58:21 I agree.  There are products available that are not necessary for a hunter or sportsman.  These products are specifically designed to kill people. Silencers, bump stocks, hollow points. These items should be taken off the market.

1118 2018-01-24 15:57:02 I don’t follow NFLX. I thought they were making money. Put them in the same class with TSLA. High flying stocks losing millions a year.
1119 2018-01-24 15:56:58 VALUE BUY: Value focus on buying stocks at a low price. The prices is low for a reason, which market has not noticed and you have noticed. The reason is a catalyst, which takes the stock up, once market identifies it.
1120 2018-01-24 15:56:57 In addition, yes the stocks are good, but that doesn't help me, or anyone else in America who doesn't have money to invest.

1160 2018-01-24 15:44:45 Those with long memories will recall that the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s grew as a result of a similar mindset among investors. Indeed, another parallel between the dotcom bubble and today is the crowding of investors into richly-priced tech stocks.

1162 2018-01-24 15:44:30 Among the many indicators that raise fears among conservative investors today is the growing popularity of momentum investing, in which the hottest, most expensive stocks are being chased regardless of fundamentals, sending their valuations up to yet more dizzying heights.

I'd argue that the data shows bonds perform very well in recessions, especially when investors flee stocks and buy them to mitigate market risk.

1243 2018-01-24 15:27:15 No. People that understand value and believe in technology buy bitcoin. Why, because we believe it is a finite item that is easily traded for value with other real people all around the world. People, like myself buy stocks to sell at a higher price.

To potential pricing wars and higher fuel costs. Seems irrational- most airlines have a monopoly on their routes, fuel price increases due more to a weak dollar not supply/dem imbalance. Also,  ancillary fee income is not taxed
1525 2018-01-24 13:59:19 One reason the stock market is doing so well is because of the tax scam: owners and shareholders are buying back stocks. And, yes, I agree that being rich should not be equated with being a good person. Or a hard worker.

1575 2018-01-24 13:35:37 The market continued to receive support from strong earnings results as more than 80% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly earnings have beaten estimates. There was also strength in energy stocks as the price of crude oil climbed +1.42%.
1576 2018-01-24 13:35:26 Tuesday's closes: S&P 500 +0.22%, Dow Jones -0.01%, Nasdaq +0.83%. The S&P 500 on Tuesday rose to a new record high and closed higher on strength in technology stocks led by the 10% surge in Netflix to an all-time high after it reported stellar quarterly earnings.
1577 2018-01-24 13:35:07 Explain this to me please.  So when the market goes up, everything goes up.  When the market goes down.  This is not the case in traditional stocks, why?

1590 2018-01-24 13:28:09 I trade forex occasionally on the higher time frames. They're great trading vehicles. I guess people like stocks since they represent ownership. Somehow people find that safer. But if you're a trader, it's a stupid reason IMHO because your goal is never to marry your positions.

1598 2018-01-24 13:26:00 Storing value in a currency typically means your value will wane. SoV needs no utility as stocks that do not pay dividends and 401k's have no present utility beyond - wait for it - stores of long term value.

1702 2018-01-24 12:32:05 Yes! So confusing. Deficits, rates, qe,... Who cares. Dollar down dollar denominated assets (gold oil stocks) up.
1703 2018-01-24 12:32:04 110% in agreement with this. It's a modern-day stocks and pillories mentality and far beneath us. And if shame worked to break the cycle of addiction, this crisis would be over, rather than growning.
1704 2018-01-24 12:32:03 Don't forget that they have had a very, very long time to prepare for this. Stocks are most likely spread out and plentiful

1713 2018-01-24 12:22:43 my issue is that my currency funds were forced back to BTC, which has since tanked. so I'm 25% down. if it were stocks then ok as it's a risk however this was on a supposedly safe charge card. you are not at all customer focused. I copied this to your CEO
1714 2018-01-24 12:21:35 It seemed like a dreadful thing to do, many people told me to quit, but choosing to trade in the stock markets was perhaps the best decision I took in 2017. Have learnt so much about fund management, stocks & strategies. Now, at times, even my broker praises my skills.

1738 2018-01-24 12:05:24 @MebFaber have you backtested a linearly proportional allocation to say the S&P500 based on CAPE? Assuming a min historical CAPE of 5 (100%allocated), Max of 45 (0% allocated), rebalancing 1/4rly. Meaning today with a CAPe of approx 30 it'd be 37.5% allocated to stocks.

1812 2018-01-24 10:58:21 This is not d first time we are having an Hausa fulani as President but this is d worst ever. Nepotism, tribalism, insecurity etc are d other of d day.

1813 2018-01-24 10:57:44 You are promoting ignorance. Instead you should be helping people by letting them know anyone can invest. It’s not only for the rich. $5 to trade and many stocks under $5. Many are in the market via pensions and 401k. The Market helps or could help everyone.

2061 2018-01-24 06:58:53 It is. That for example someone working with compliance and thus has insider knowledge about the stock market is restricted to buy or sell stocks is natural.

2188 2018-01-24 05:14:15 Why Stocks Status were NECESSARY? Perhaps ONLY Sales Status is cheering, Fast & Slow SKU Updates are not at Priority. Get Well Soon.

2244 2018-01-24 04:33:34 Stocks are like merchandise. The higher the competition in an industry (lots of substitutes, low switching costs etc), the quicker sellers lower prices once demand peaks. The more low float stocks in play, the harder trash stocks fade once demand (volume) peaks. #capitalizeOnThat

2278 2018-01-24 04:11:51 For US stocks, the short-term speculative return has never looked so promising - it seems certain that stocks will be up five months from now - while the long-term investment return has never looked so bad - it seems certain that real returns will be poor five years from now.

2282 2018-01-24 04:08:52 Hubs was a Certified Financal Advisor. He always says since the market is cyclical it depends on when you plan to retire. If not for another 8-10 years don’t panic about the market. Diversify your portfolio with about 60% in stocks. We’ve been through this before.

2305 2018-01-24 03:50:57 The one thing I don’t like about investing in crypto is the unpredictability. Unlike stocks, nobody knows if it’s going up, down, or sideways. Everyone just buys the dip and hopes to get rich. It’s just hard for me to invest like that #btc #eth #ltc

2322 2018-01-24 03:41:38 Its been less than a year since #bitcoin #stocks have been popular. #MJ stocks have been being played for 4 years now and still going strong. Point is, all of y'all dissing bitcoin stocks are gonna look like idiots in coming months and perhaps years - thats just my opinion.

2324 2018-01-24 03:40:17 Watching and your male white privilege is shining through. You are blinded by your ego and the fact your stocks are doing well (Greed) If God put trump in office it was to put an horrific obstacle in our way for us to take notice and make changes. Nothing good about trump.

2329 2018-01-24 03:38:54 Crunching some numbers on the past 8 years of FASF returns:
1) more than 100% of cum. outperformance came in months where the ASX was negative;
2) Strike rate past 4 years (no. wins/no. investments) just 62%. Lost money on 38% of the stocks invested in, and generated 20%+ p.a.

2333 2018-01-24 03:35:51 Well played...the case for owning high growth stocks surely will diminish if the “bull” narrative about higher economic growth is for real.
2334 2018-01-24 03:35:40 Franklin Graham on @CNN  is disconnected.
Wall Street amd it's stocks benefit the 2%.
Middle.class is shrinking, pay raises are null.
Poor folks do NOT benefit from stocks doing well?
More bullshit!
2335 2018-01-24 03:35:36 Crockpot stocks will be dropping now. Why do you do this to us #ThisIsUs ? Not sure I’m ready for that next episode.

2343 2018-01-24 03:32:00 that's a good amount of stocks per game
2344 2018-01-24 03:31:15 Yea, I think there's only a percentage that matters when you're in a raging bull market.  You can basically throw a dart on at a list of Cannabis Stocks and chances are they are going up.  That said, I do believe in Buying at the right time and adding on the right dips.
2345 2018-01-24 03:27:38 So you you telling us to buy outside the Dow?  International stocks?  I invest through Schwab, and have 30% international exposure.  For my 26 year old son, I put it into 50% international exposure.  Between emerging markets, small cap and large cap.  All Schwab  mutual funds.
2346 2018-01-24 03:26:52 Stocks, at least, have intrinsic worth. Bitcoin is losing its advantages.

2348 2018-01-24 03:26:45 #ThisIsUs Crock Pots stocks just plummeted.

2355 2018-01-24 03:25:12 Can you elaborate on this? How would tokenized securities act differently than traditional stocks once regulated?
2356 2018-01-24 03:24:36 But hey! The stocks are soaring. Ha ha ha.
2357 2018-01-24 03:24:32 I like to hunt deer and ducks as much as the next guy. But I’m tired of reading about these school shootings.  Handguns and bumper stocks have no place here.
2358 2018-01-24 03:23:23 Pulling stocks down would be so easy.. Trade in out of money options to hit those limits..

Selling will come v next day
2359 2018-01-24 03:23:04 profitable and admired... it is well deserved. And stocks have raised, and that's because we are in the right way and the right journey ( to the cloud )

2362 2018-01-24 03:22:06 Funny. The rest of the world seems to do just fine without hand guns and bumper stocks.
2363 2018-01-24 03:21:26 Exterminating, I don't want to be exterminated. I think the gentlewomen Senator has realized not everyone believes Democrats anymore.

2364 2018-01-24 03:21:22 Definitely. Then grow those $5 Mill more through stocks, bonds, FD's & real estate!

2368 2018-01-24 03:15:45 So surely cheaper to have free stocks of such drugs in the gp surgery. You dont need a prescription for it
2369 2018-01-24 03:15:34 Shorting stocks in the mania phase is not only difficult but also quite stupid and more risky than buying $NFLX at top of channel. Thems the facts man

2371 2018-01-24 03:15:00 Another Earning day with pre-budget rally and living in positive zone, expect to open negative. 
Logically no major resistance now and keep your stop loss below 10980 for long trades.

2378 2018-01-24 03:11:02 Well, Marty... you are certainly entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts. YTD is not pre-announcement levels.

2384 2018-01-24 03:08:46 Excuse me watch who you call a “Moran”. 401k are a collective that join together and BUY stocks
2385 2018-01-24 03:08:34 No but as long as they work for the administration they can do whatever they want or own any stocks they want. They seemed to check ethics at the front door.

2402 2018-01-24 02:59:53 You are so wrong. If you work like at dicks or Home Depot or really anywhere, you can buy in to the program. Different all over but usually you put in some money and workplace puts in money and a group of stocks form the 401.
2403 2018-01-24 02:59:52 URA has found support at 14.40 last week and yesterday. Last hour of trading today URA hit 14.50 and finished at 14.64 on nice vol. Just a thought but I think U stocks are heading up tomorrow.
2404 2018-01-24 02:59:06 401Ks can be many different things. Our 401K is almost 100% stocks and is up significantly in the last couple of years. You should be more careful with that moron label. To be fair, it was reduced to a “201K” when Bush was in office. It really made a comeback under @BarackObama.
2405 2018-01-24 02:58:51 First I wanna wish you for your new '#avatar' " #desi zero hedge".. And I am only selling and selling my portfolio stocks from last 15 sessions. Watching movie 'the bear' daily before sleeping..

2407 2018-01-24 02:57:27 Thanks for links. I let them know voters are critical thinkers who know it is silly attempting to regulate bumpstocks. More slidefire stocks have been sold since the Vegas massacre, than all the years before. Factory is working 24x7, and not  taking new orders until caught up.
2408 2018-01-24 02:56:28 I need to educate myself on stocks.

2417 2018-01-24 02:49:28 @djvlad @vladstocks What would u suggest investing your money through to buy stocks... Something like Ameri-trade or use a stock broker?
2418 2018-01-24 02:48:43 I love #Stocks & think this year still going to be a GREAT year for quality companies. That said, @ indices level I still like S&P 500 $ES_F & #Nikkei 225 $NKD_F... But I do think Dow Jones will weaken $YM_F. If stocks do weaken - #Gold $GC_F #Yen $JPY & #VIX $VIX for protection!

2454 2018-01-24 02:31:29 Trump is guilty of every murder caused by guns because he won't place stricter gun control laws or ban bump stocks.
2455 2018-01-24 02:30:59 Yeah nasty today. Bounce down the road yes.
2456 2018-01-24 02:29:59 European stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with German and UK indices rising while French and Italian benchmarks lost ground.
2457 2018-01-24 02:29:33 @FXS_Stocks_DE Imagine space without danger of collision, where the skies don't become clouded with millions of us discarded parts.
2458 2018-01-24 02:28:44 Getting crushed today. Trades super thin... Worth watching for a big bounce down the road . But that was gross
2459 2018-01-24 02:28:43 I guess it takes a while to get the formula right. Malaysian stocks are supported by the pension funds here - that's no surprise to anyone, but they probably have better governance structures.
2460 2018-01-24 02:27:55 US stocks mostly rose on Tuesday, led by a 10% spike in @netflix after the internet streaming company reported strong-than-expected subscriber growth in the December quarter.

2463 2018-01-24 02:26:49 Well, that is a total lie. If you have any retirement plan (Roth, 401K, Corp profit sharing) you own stocks. So I call you out and say you do not know what you are talking about.
2464 2018-01-24 02:24:54 Be less simplistic. Most very rich people make vast majority of money from stocks/dividends taxed at preferentially low capital gains rate ~1/2 of top earned income tax rate, Others game the system to make & take advantage of tax loopholes. Small % goes thru W-2 for very rich.
2465 2018-01-24 02:24:49 According to J. Stieglitz, (Nobel winner etc.) 8 families own 44% of all America's wealth.  America has the highest child poverty rate in the developed world!  I'll bet the farm they're not buying stocks!
2466 2018-01-24 02:24:22 This is patently false. The dow is an average of tens of thousands of stocks. Most retirement accounts lost, flatlined or rose very little under Obama.
2467 2018-01-24 02:23:45 Not sure what equipment you’re referring to but any modifications that makes revolvers as dangerous as semiautomatics would also need to be outlawed just like bump-stocks need to be outlawed for making burst fire weapons as dangerous as full auto.

2469 2018-01-24 02:22:27 Thanks for the info. One thing I always wonder with these stocks; is technical analysis as much of a factor? Lots of hype with lots of new investors paired with not a lot of fundamentals (although I’d argue if anyone has fundementals it would be $THCX). 1/2
2470 2018-01-24 02:22:26 @elonmusk I hear there is a opening at Twitter for COO. Since you “love twitter” you interested? I think the interview process would be quick and painless with your credentials.  @jack $twtr
2471 2018-01-24 02:22:04 But worst case, it’s sub 3% of his fund. Not gonna blow me up at my cost basis. 4. Most of his other investments are solid companies that should on avg grow with market as whole if not better 5. Only bet I don’t actually like is $FNMA will go private but stocks may get nothing
2472 2018-01-24 02:21:57 Ahh yes how I know what you mean. Enjoy I’ll go invest in Kleenex stocks 
2473 2018-01-24 02:21:39 Yeah but with bump stocks that doesn't matter.
2474 2018-01-24 02:20:50 Bro I swear I reall did see a fucking deerbra on the highway!
2475 2018-01-24 02:19:59 Many of these stocks are based on real property and pay dividends in the 8-12% range. Capital appreciation is tough in modern efficiently priced markets. I’m gonna love this unwind. 
2476 2018-01-24 02:19:45 #Gold rallied massively past two years, as has... had $PVG before today, & gold sentiment is badly stretched at the moment while its price is up against historical resistance. It's unlikely to do well when stocks soon plunge & attendant margin calls come, same as in '08.
2477 2018-01-24 02:18:59 If you are in your 50's or 60's know that Republican'ts are going to and have been destroying social security. 
Remember what happen to seniors 401k and stocks during the banksters fraud that meltdown our economy.
You need s.s. and make sure they keep it.

2484 2018-01-24 02:15:31 There is a thirst for assets regardless if they are bonds, stocks, crypto, art whatever. So much cash out there from central banks. The idea it would be some kind of hedge in the event of a crash isn't really thinking it through just like those who say gold is one.
2485 2018-01-24 02:14:25 @hqtrivia Questions stopped showing for me tonight around question 5. Not sure what happened but was totally bummed :/
2486 2018-01-24 02:12:27 Exchanges bots pump(more than dump) the opening in 1h and 1d for whatever reason. On the other hand, in the stocks, opening afects, as well as monday. In any case, who wouldnt prefer a 24/7 market who doesnt sleep?

2495 2018-01-24 02:08:39 @Everestbull they are not paid shills but are known shorties. They short a lot of stocks and also hide their true identity
2496 2018-01-24 02:08:39 (ARGS) is just a lotto  trade for me but every now and then stocks that split still trade to it’s post-split form. So with that being said they still have phase 3 data that if passed it could send this well over $30 easy...Note: This don’t always be the case good luck.
2497 2018-01-24 02:08:37 If you haven't bought one of those bump fire stocks you def should.  I got one for my AK and it's badass
2498 2018-01-24 02:08:12 Long term trends favor stocks. But yeah, money is emotional.

2513 2018-01-24 01:58:33 I was investing via Lehman Bros. when they collapsed. My brokers advised me to get out of the market because of exposure to housing stocks via SP500.  Within two months, boom.  Lehman knew what was coming, they just didn't know they'd go down, too.

2515 2018-01-24 01:58:13 Wrobby, you are so wrong.
73% of all working adults in US owns stocks either directly or through some type of retirement plan. Teachers, fire, police, factor union workers, nurses, janitors....most all of the middle class.

But hey, you keep watching CNN for your news.
2516 2018-01-24 01:58:04 Good question to ask is how many "experts" believe bump stocks could assist in that rapid of fire as compared to fully automatic belt fed which most believe.

2526 2018-01-24 01:49:18 How about some gun control then?? Or maybe, as a Nevadan this is important to us, we ban bump stocks. Maybe, if you did something about gun control then, this wouldn't have happened!!! #DoYourJob
2527 2018-01-24 01:48:05 Do you know why now Red Velvet's members never wear any wig when they about to have their cb?

2535 2018-01-24 01:43:18 Well now you know why when almost 600 people were  mowed down in Las Vegas Members of the Cabinet and Congress nor the White House wanted to push regulations against bump stocks and legislation against military-type weapons. We need to find out how many Cabinet members own stock.

2545 2018-01-24 01:38:43 I trade stocks as a hobby, DVR Fast Money/Mad Money every day for ideas. I’m up 24 percent just to start 2018.

Would not touch Barstool after that interview. And I say that acknowledging they found a market and captured it, which is admirable.
2546 2018-01-24 01:38:10 He said top ten percent and he didn’t say all stocks. Try getting your own data — it’s out there, just be sure it is fact based and not based on “alternative facts”.

2549 2018-01-24 01:37:10 Hey, lady, did you see the tweet below yours? Here it is in case you missed it:
Half of all Americans don’t own stocks, and 80% of all stocks are owned by the top 10% of income earners in this country. Goes to show who Trump is representing with his “populist” ideology.
2550 2018-01-24 01:35:42 @PeteinSD yeah that looks close to mine in the chart a few posts down. Watching close for volume to fall out. Death for penny stocks.

2562 2018-01-24 01:23:19 You misunderstood his statement about stocks and ownership. The stock market is not an indication of how the non 1%s  are doing financially overall.  Stocks can be up and your wages can be FLAT!
2563 2018-01-24 01:23:09 First of all, assault rifles are not banned. For instance the AR-15, a favorite of mass shooters, is available in most places. You may be thinking of automatic weapons. And legal bump stocks essentially turn semi-automatic firing weapons fully automatic.
2564 2018-01-24 01:23:01 If @realDonaldTrump wanted to help the #coal industry he'd tariff things that reduce demand for coal such as #steel, #NaturalGas, #oil, more coal, etc. All a #tariff on #SolarPanels does is create artificial scarcity and a temporary surge in solar manufacturer stocks.

2582 2018-01-24 01:15:02 I bet na by mid-year PSEi will reach 10,000! Good year for stocks!
2583 2018-01-24 01:13:49 It's technically all bitcoin, kinda like how all the different stocks are still part of the NASDAQ or DOW-Jones
2584 2018-01-24 01:13:37 Probably the people that aren’t educated about the market, are on the wrong side of the trade, live paycheck to paycheck, or think stocks are only for the rich. They’re missing out

2586 2018-01-24 01:13:01 Just read how millennials are finally gravitating towards stocks. If that’s true then where are the new entrants for crypto going to come from? Over 90% of crypto trading comes from Asia, mainly China, Japan & South Korea(maybe just Korea soon if this unification theory holds)
2587 2018-01-24 01:12:50 .... and that varied collection shall suffice for today. I will note, I don't cover stocks <$1.00. Yours truly is pushing hard, as the mini legion will >2K in Feb'. Time for a movie. Goodnight from London.
2588 2018-01-24 01:11:55 @CharlieBakerMA wants people to trust the government well I'll trust them when I die. MA liberals ban bump stocks because one Fucktard used 1 in vegas and now have to turn them in or be considered a outlaw well I say Fuck that keep them fire all who are supposed to work for US
2589 2018-01-24 01:11:41 Sooo people are spending more $$, stocks are at an all time high, military is once again getting respect...yeah, he says dumb things on Twitter. I’m all good thanks
2590 2018-01-24 01:08:06 Please make one for weed stocks!
2591 2018-01-24 01:07:29 Not seeing these on CoinMarketCap.. are they stocks?
2592 2018-01-24 01:06:35 How the he'll do you figure.. my stocks are the highest I've ever seen.  Not including my retirement. And now a tax break.  A real tax break. I want to know where y'all people are from. Did you want Hillary Clinton to be our next president just because she's a woman are u nuts
2593 2018-01-24 01:06:30 Today @jimcramer on @MadMoneyOnCNBC stated you should buy stocks on bad news.  I bought $intc a few weeks ago on bad news and haven't looked back.
2594 2018-01-24 01:06:27 its 24 jan and no stocks.exchangeon etg ???? whats happend
2595 2018-01-24 01:06:25 Wish we could, but the vitriol is sudden and savage when someone even suggests reasonable restrictions (like banning bump stocks or actually closing gun show sale background check loopholes). We will keep trying but it's going to take getting money and bad people out of politics.
2596 2018-01-24 01:05:47 U mean like stocks?? I truly don’t know a damn thing abt them
2597 2018-01-24 01:04:48 Can I trade these stocks from Sydney Australia? If so how? Do you know someone in Sydney who could set me up? I will be in your summit.
2598 2018-01-24 01:04:36 Not one minute too soon...he is ruining America....his base has no stocks, I do and I will sacrifice to help the poor people's campaign. Clear air safe food and water!
2599 2018-01-24 01:02:58 Actually IBM earnings weren’t that bad and the stock price hasn’t gone anywhere for almost a decade.  Some company stocks are WAY overpriced though and there will be a more substantial pullback when investors have other options to put their money.
2600 2018-01-24 01:02:54 I don’t know how it works but the related stocks pay my mortgage
2601 2018-01-24 01:01:19 Blackstone reveals its ignorance of Indian history, both past n present. Hope its choice of stocks does not have this level of ignorance.

2603 2018-01-24 01:00:22 Yeah, stocks! Those always keep going up, have nothing to do with Wall Street types assuming Trump will be corrupt for them, and and are real important to the 50% of Americans who don't own any!
2604 2018-01-24 01:00:13 What if Twitter announced native Module file support?

Would that be cool or what? I can guarantee their stocks would sky rocket.
2605 2018-01-24 00:57:43 1.Gun shows have to follow the same federal laws as the rest of the country. 2. Who decided who is mentally ill. And what qualifies a mental illness to not carry. 3. Fine outlaw bump stocks, but 1 trigger pull 1 bullet is more then reasonable.
2606 2018-01-24 00:57:28 Yes and some of our politicians like the Clinton’s own Hugh amounts of stocks in big pharmaceuticals . Which is why they are allowed to charge so much . It was all rigged before universal healthcare.
2607 2018-01-24 00:57:28 You are imbecile for believing this version. India was occupied by the British during the Bengal famine. Madras, Punjab and Bengal. There was enough grain but it was in the control of the british. They shipped it to Britian for reserve stocks of soldiers there.
2608 2018-01-24 00:54:52 You really don't get it and just not too bright. Go work on something else. Your not taking our guns and until parents start parenting as they should these are gonna continue . I suppose bump stocks being banned would have stopped this right? Isn't that your latest fight.
2609 2018-01-24 00:54:32 I got Invited to a few. I hate them. They're all over in crypto and penny stocks
2610 2018-01-24 00:54:12 So I just checked my stocks for the first time in about a week and..... my portfolio grew by 67% just today... I’m pumped 
2611 2018-01-24 00:52:19 Firstly, your handle is hilarious! LOL! Well done.
Secondly, just learn everyday and follow the news. Study dotcom bubble, penny stocks. Take profit regularly even at the risk of potential gains. Withdraw initial investment and resist putting it back in.
2612 2018-01-24 00:51:54 @GOP @DNC  Another shooting in Kentucky. What happened to gun changes after Vegas? What happened from banning bump stocks?  Stop being run by @NRA
2613 2018-01-24 00:51:37 Do we know he was a white supremacists?  Disturbing but there is never any outrage when one of these white dudes shoot up anyplace.  Bump stocks still can be bought even after the Vegas massive shooting..but he was white, as was the guy shooting everyone at the church.
2614 2018-01-24 00:50:30 I would like to point out we still have zero discussion on gun control, two school shootings in 2 Days with kids dead and injured. Also the NRA donated $30million to IQ45’s campaign and bump stocks are still legal.
2615 2018-01-24 00:50:04 You know you're "adulting" when you're preparing to invest in stocks.. #newyearnewme

2619 2018-01-24 00:47:10 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 1) 1 Woman never owned stocks,real estate,etc., so find formula for each Citizen to own10-100 shares stock
2620 2018-01-24 00:47:02 Apparently going "all cash" now means investing in international stocks.
2621 2018-01-24 00:46:09 I tweet for friendly advice. Just like to help people. I have been following marijuana stocks for several years. My picks r from my due diligence.
2622 2018-01-24 00:45:59 Yep because the democrats are the true bad guys and your stocks are looking very good understand president Trump but you are to ton deaf to admit to it.
2623 2018-01-24 00:45:19 Tepper clearly stated that stocks seem as inexpensive now as they were in Jan 2017, and he just doesn't see any sign of overvaluation.    Who is anyone to argue?   :)
2624 2018-01-24 00:44:51 I think he meant stocks re-invested
2625 2018-01-24 00:44:37 Each day that passes is a missed opportunity. If you r still not in marijuana stocks, you are missing an amazing opportunity. IMO. All tips and suggestions are just that . They r my opinion. Please make choices that are your own
2626 2018-01-24 00:44:33 Best time to be on holidays. While everyone was crapping themselves and selling good stocks I'm on the beach in Thailand
2627 2018-01-24 00:44:03 Rich kid's parents invest in stocks and poor kids parents play the lotto.
2628 2018-01-24 00:43:09 So some of those stocks I mentioned and there are many more . Just like I did in 2017 when the trolls and bashers were chirping. Ones the business cycles takes place look the fuck out. I will shut them up like i ways do

2631 2018-01-24 00:41:28 Once again as  the subsistence/Tribe ‘s proposals to preserve the ancient herring stocks and subsistence lifestyle got voted down at the #Alaskaboardoffisheries it felt like a racist vote by the board Industry vs the Natives/Indians Some things just never change!!

2633 2018-01-24 00:40:06 How about legislation on gun violence Senator? Background checks, bump stocks, Magazine size, and gun show loop hole. Thoughts and prayers aren’t cutting it.

@WendyOsefo It is not problematic for me and the rest of the the country. I think my family needs to eat more than being green. You, Soros and the other globalist selling solar stocks need to move on.
2637 2018-01-24 00:34:14 I’ll still stick ya moms for them stocks and bonds.

2643 2018-01-24 00:30:10 @netflix stocks is up 30% this year, as the best performing internet firms have continued to lead major indexes higher
2644 2018-01-24 00:29:29 I don't like either side, but public companies are OWNED by the shareholders. That's why, since the 80s, CEOs push up stocks. Anyway to cut costs.. automate if they can & if cannot, then go for cheap labor overseas. Costs DOWN = their stock UP. Ppl buy online, no need for retail.
2645 2018-01-24 00:29:25 Who is stopping you from buying stocks?

2648 2018-01-24 00:28:21 @Pedroncelli Hi there, we had a bottle of your Sauvignon Blanc East Side. It was absolutely amazing !! Is there anywhere in the UK that stocks it for sale to the public ?
2649 2018-01-24 00:28:15 Assault rifles have been banned for decades. Bump stocks might be something to consider.
2650 2018-01-24 00:28:12 I've never seen the U.S. markets this strong before, they've got another potential shutdown after funding runs out in 3 weeks & everyone wants to keep buying stocks. Unbelievable. If this is what tax reform can do to businesses - because reporting seasons matter - Oz needs it.

2657 2018-01-24 00:25:35 How about a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. They're completely unnecessary. Smaller magazine size?
2658 2018-01-24 00:24:09 anyone else notice how talk about restricting bump stocks faded into the abyss?
2659 2018-01-24 00:24:06 Don't distract from passion! Embrace it and enjoy journey towards financial freedom and success that is pot stocks.
2660 2018-01-24 00:23:50 Nice $AMRN 5+ soon
2661 2018-01-24 00:23:20 Predominantly white male? Actually, the talking point for years, and still is, it not that a gun was used but what style. i.e. Round capacity, automatic, etc. which is why there has been a call for bump stocks. Because they increase fire rate.
2662 2018-01-24 00:22:36 Do you Do stocks ?

2678 2018-01-24 00:06:26 Are you even paying attention to what’s happening with this administration? If you think stocks being up means everything is great you’re just plain ignorant. And I’m not sure about your unemployment stat either.

2683 2018-01-24 00:04:41 Apparently banks aren't supposed to be for profit businesses.  Many of the people complaining about fees own bank stocks via mutual funds in their 401(k) and don't even know it.
2684 2018-01-24 00:04:11 They are market makers (mm)...they are on Level 2 - You must have Level 2, to trade stocks, ask your platform ( etrade, ameritrade, etc) if you get free...but get it even if you have to pay.  Usually they are Dilutors
