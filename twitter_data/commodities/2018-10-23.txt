41 2018-10-23 22:54:22 That’s it.. let’s just conquer all the rest of (Central/South) America as the #ManifestDestiny purported our nation to do! More taxation, More commodities, a super industrialized agrarianism economy.. the illegals now become legal!! Yay #Globalism
42 2018-10-23 22:53:27 No era un lujo. Fue una época de commodities a precios por las nubes. Y de cosechas récord. Y muchos cerraron. Y muchos dejaron de despedir porque les impusieron multas o les pusieron un revólver en el escritorio. No seas ingenuo. Argentina es inviable!!!!!
43 2018-10-23 22:45:04 Isso não procede. A China o nosso maior comprador de commodities agrícolas, impulsiona 1/4 do PIB.
44 2018-10-23 22:35:00 Yes and if more people invested in other commodities, the demand for home ownership would be reduced and houses would become more affordable to buy, thus reducing the pool of people who need to rent. Right now we’re in obscene situation where buying AND renting are unaffordable.
45 2018-10-23 22:28:55 The comments in this thread acting like these are commodities instead of people is so disgusting
46 2018-10-23 22:26:33 Mostra Dilma 2, não se iluda, apesar de esta iludido, não houve crescimento econômico na era Lula/Dilma, o que houve foi a valorização das commodities o que impulsionou o mercado, a falsa ilusão do crescimento.
47 2018-10-23 22:22:00 1. Entreguismo esta sendo feito hoje. Commodities, minérios, portos, soberania de terras, fronteiras, etc. A proposta dele é proteger isso.
2. Vender estatais, estado mínimo, menor chances de corrupção (estatais) e desinchar a pesada máquina pública que temos hoje.

52 2018-10-23 22:04:22 Contale que exportamos commodities que no compiten por precio, son tomadoras. Cuando devaluás el principal resultado es efecto riqueza para el exportador, caída de salarios, del consumo, ergo de la demanda y del PIB. El ajuste externo es por caída de impo.
53 2018-10-23 22:03:17 Mr Ridd, Pls no insults, can you show Nigerians what your Mr Integrity has done that has made him borrowed 11trn in 3 years more than what the very corrupt PDP borrowed in 16 years, yet prices of all commodities doubled. 

Thank you as I anticipate you response.
54 2018-10-23 22:01:55 *happens a lot and it’s not solely because we know we’re hot commodities, it just happens a lot a lot and it’s annoying.
55 2018-10-23 22:01:48 There are benefits to having an international supply base for steel and other commodities as well
56 2018-10-23 21:56:11 On a pedantic note I don't like the phrasing 'adding value'as it leads to a substantialist understanding of value. As workers sweat gold into commodities. I know how pedantic that is
57 2018-10-23 21:53:45 Stop treating your friends as commodities to enhance your personal image.

59 2018-10-23 21:43:55 Poinsett Rice & Grain is in need of some trucks in NE Arkansas. multiple commodities centralized around Marked Tree and Osceola Arkansas. Give me a call @ 870-227-1688
60 2018-10-23 21:43:32 That would be try if all firms produced commodities - but the cycle of productive capital is intermeshed with cycles of commodity capital and money capital which also accumulate profit (even if the origin point of all profit is surplus value). On top of this are countless scams
61 2018-10-23 21:35:52 não há garantia....pode voltar pra "-40%"....."-30%.....no meio do caminho, tivemos bolha de commodities, dinheiro barato, bilhoes de estimulos na China. juros zero....estamos entrando num mundo diferente de 2010-2014..
62 2018-10-23 21:20:28 Crude #oil down nearly 5% on mix of macro sell-off, #SaudiaArabia signals on production, and demand worries in emerging markets. Brent traded as low as $75.88 a barrel today; in early October it hit $86.74 a barrel | #OOTT #commodities

64 2018-10-23 21:13:22 @fordnation people need a higher wage so they can participate in the economy, it’s not fucking neuroscience. If people can’t afford to pay people a living wage then they don’t deserve to be in business, and they won’t be when nobody can afford their services, or commodities.
65 2018-10-23 21:08:18 English football teams are not global commodities to be bought & sold by billionaires & for Japanese companies to bribe to play in a global league destroying our traditions. What I said was the internationalisation of our clubs in harmful to them & their ties to their communities
66 2018-10-23 21:07:45 Do you have current prices for the above commodities ?
67 2018-10-23 21:02:28 hawa watu hukuanga na trolley kubwa supa huangalia mtu vibaya nikama izi commodities ndogo ni za kupamba supa
68 2018-10-23 21:01:56 En el caso de los exportadores un aumento de costos les tira abajo la tasa de ganancia porque son tomadores de precios, sobre todo las commodities.

En n/país cuando se habla de atraso cambiario, en el fondo te quieren decir que los costos están pisando su márgen de ganancia

73 2018-10-23 20:50:15 They will survive if the work on their inefficiencies and be able to compete on the global stage. The infant industry argument is so yesteryear that it no longer has any takers. You were also hard done by some retailers who were leaking these basic commodities to the black market
74 2018-10-23 20:37:35 Is there anybody who hasn't figured it out that Americans are going to be paying for those tariffs?  Gas is up, commodities are up, housing prices are up and food is up all because of tariffs.  
After all, you didn't really think that the rich factory owners would pay, did you?

79 2018-10-23 20:17:19 Surprised more brands/commodities don't use Amex Offers; targeted and timely offers that help push consumer to make decision they a) wouldn't have made w/o offer (1,000 Amex Points for $50 purchase) or b) indifferent as to which brands (Spend $50 get $10 back)
80 2018-10-23 20:11:40 What yu are saying is true especially on the part of relatives supplying us with basic commodities. What we are saying is  'We can't buy out there ' they need forex only, and for us to get it we will go on the parallel markets ,that demand will push them to react by raising rates

82 2018-10-23 20:05:54 everybody has compared this bear to 2014. lots of the same people compare CME addition of BTC to the addition of other commodities that got slaughtered.

they both can't be true. either we long bear or we dip & bounce like gold did.
83 2018-10-23 20:05:26 All economic indicators reveal blooming economy, no appeasement, debts o/a crude by UPA cleared, army being modernised, long term projects in pipeline require reasonable time to yield, backlog of 60 Y can't be cleared in 5Y, Price level of essential commodities under control
84 2018-10-23 20:04:12 I think that was on the table at some point. Walmart types probably need t source quite bit of stuff locally(it may struggle due t supply limitation of e.g fruits, veggies, other produce). So buttom line supply of basic commodities remains as issue.
85 2018-10-23 19:55:17 @tanatsei @MooseOnTheTabl8 The cabinet has relaxed protectionist policies on commodities thereby invoking imported inflation. Ultimately hyperinflationary pressures will mount as a result of having demand pull inflation aggravated by imported inflation. Black market now official
86 2018-10-23 19:54:12 Hope all basic commodities from SA will flood our  markets soon. Once supply surpasses demand, prices are likely to fall.
87 2018-10-23 19:53:13 Stock options aren’t given to commodities. They’re given to productive employees.
88 2018-10-23 19:44:14 FG should work on controlling price of commodities, not population
89 2018-10-23 19:33:04 Bingo. At this point flipping picks for proven commodities seems like the best bet since defensive player development is subpar at best
90 2018-10-23 19:19:44 - No sé si leíste las noticias pero subieron las retenciones de nuevo, y con el precio de commodities tan bajo, hoy el campo está tan mal como con los K. El Estado se sigue llevando más del 60% de la ganancia del campo.
91 2018-10-23 19:16:49 Taxes,fares and commodities increase everyday but our wages and salaries rather REDUCE! Some of us worked for 6 months with no pay (we are still waiting for that miracle pay) but I keep hearing Ghana's economy is the BEST SO FAR! I wonder what country I am living in atm.
92 2018-10-23 19:12:52 I hate when in r/Madrid (subreddit for my city), tourists ask for things they normally do in USA/UK. Asking for US candies, bard to see UK/USA sports, asking for USA/UK commodities and customs... Fuck off, why do you come to Spain in the first place?
93 2018-10-23 19:05:54 Money changers are"off the streets", gvt has revoked SI122 of 2017. Where do pple get forex with which to go and buy those items and commodities if banks are still not giving forex?
94 2018-10-23 18:58:22 Can’t see it Clint .. not when it comes to wholly imported finished goods described as critical commodities RBZ or Government have NOT provided any currency to the importer/distributor!
95 2018-10-23 18:57:27 What red flags to look for in the art market for money laundering through art? Artefacts from conflict zones; without provenance; commodities not matching the vendor; sudden change of company/ownershio name... among other things
96 2018-10-23 18:54:09 I believe the real problem is real BUT It is being grossly exaggerated by the left as an excuse for further taxation and pursuit of ideological policies. We need to focus on our strengths which is commodities not pursue pie in the sky ideas
97 2018-10-23 18:52:17 This is all because of a system your country has embraced for hundreds of years, that corporations dictate the rules and people are mere commodities and resources to be replaced. If you are truly angry, get out and vote for lawmakers who support regulations, unions, etc!
98 2018-10-23 18:50:03 Ya, that's a really good point. It was achievable via stock proxies in commodities like gold silver and oil.  It's also relevant to point out that the 70s followed the nifty fifty era of extreme overvaluation and concentration in US eq mkts.
99 2018-10-23 18:41:29 Lower buy-stops on Dec. S&P futures to 2780 and Dec. Dow futures to 25,350 to take a profit-but stay long SPXS bear fund. #Commodities #Stocks #Dow

101 2018-10-23 18:38:22 There is no shortage of commodities in Zimbabwe. It's only a matter of panic buying.

102 2018-10-23 18:36:39 Absolutely correct. That is exactly how this market works and why it is so different from all the other commodities. One minute your sitting on a ew penny stocks...next minute they are worth a fortune. Just wait that is all you have to do. My estimate remains at late 2020.
103 2018-10-23 18:35:37 Good thing commodities are at a nice low *were at
104 2018-10-23 18:34:33 just started reading it. Children are fast becoming commodities for economic engineering and political career making here. Our attitudes to children need to fundamentally change.

2) the belief than anyone not in the Illuminati are commodities (sheep) to be used however they see fit. 
3) The needs of the few outweigh the needs of the masses
4) They believe themselves to be gods

113 2018-10-23 18:20:09 Agree wz logistics. But even with multiple outlets  still needs ton of $ t import basic commodities. That fundamentally needs t change into a highly scaled up commpetitive dom production. Need  food(basic commodities importing) t stabilize demand.

116 2018-10-23 18:02:41 From an economic perspective, seeing as commodities & services are often priced in futures and given trumps efforts to stop immigration. Shouldn't we be paying around $300 a plate for authentic Mexican food right now? Careful what you wish for...
117 2018-10-23 18:02:05 Agree price control won't work .Perhaps gvt should do indirect subsidy of "basic" commodities through new incentives 4 investors, tax breaks etc t  domestic production  that will help stabilize markets. Basic food items 4 ex are highly subsidized in dev world.

120 2018-10-23 18:00:33 Idea here in corn would be to buy the pullback and look for today's highs to be broken and open gap filled at 373.25 and extended targets to NVPOC at 374.75. Other commodities may drag at corn fwiw

123 2018-10-23 17:58:10 At the next crash all confidence will be lost in stocks, bonds, fiat or anything with counter party risk. That's why all that cash will have no where to go but to real hard assets, commodities. Confidence in the financial system itself will be lost.....

127 2018-10-23 17:52:48 It freaks me out because it’s the most obvious sign that whoever the creators are, they value women, esp non white women, only for their value  as commodities rather than people in & of themselves and by extension so do consumers and those that support this
128 2018-10-23 17:49:29 And when you see the ground reality  we are selfish creatures and want good salaries and cheap commodities. That will never happen if a small portion of population is forming half of our GDP. Some of the world's richest people are in our country yet we r poor. Why is that?
129 2018-10-23 17:46:21 Y? Cuál sería el problema de producir commodities? Cuál sería la inmoralidad?

Qué gente de razonamientos tan retorcidos y extraños que existen en los países socialistas...
130 2018-10-23 17:44:11 +1 John. 
*Borrowing* the money by way of a mortgage to purchase an asset (the home) and expecting someone else to pay for it (the renter) is ridiculous.
Rent received should not be used to cover 100% of mortgage / maintenance etc!
Houses should be homes! Not commodities!
131 2018-10-23 17:43:40 So what kind of regulation did you have in mind when a band sells tshirts and coffee mugs? Probably should regulate that too right? They’re already regulated. They’re called commodities.
132 2018-10-23 17:41:54 what is the logic behind suspending import ban what I know from a layman's view it is not like Zimbabweans have forex but cannot find commodities in shops. People have rtgs balances that have no value are we going to use ecocash n swipe to buy imported goods definitely no
133 2018-10-23 17:39:50 Many market participants are convinced the next crisis will play out similarly to 2008: big USD safe-haven bid; gold/commodities heavily sold, etc. They fail to appreciate that almost all the monetary-related dynamics are different now compared to then.
134 2018-10-23 17:37:18 Day 2 #100DaysOfCode. I continue with "Learn Python" by #codecademy. My goal is web app that displays my interpretation of COT report for selected commodities. #Python. 
135 2018-10-23 17:35:06 Dead on. A large majority of market participants is convinced the next crisis will play out similarly to 2008: big USD safe-haven bid; gold/commodities heavily sold, etc. They fail to appreciate that almost everything is different now compared to then.
136 2018-10-23 17:34:48 They Gvt shld just let them look for their USD let the procurement be open like they have done on cooking oil and other commodities
137 2018-10-23 17:33:25 Agree. It's like the saying when you've a hammer. But if the claim is true though it's a concern. Gvt also should use smart policies n market forces t reign in such concerns. Obviously it seems still a large gap exists bn supply n demand in a number of commodities.
138 2018-10-23 17:32:53 I saw that Merton will be 50% crypto, 40% commodities in preparation. What do you think? Scary, right?

140 2018-10-23 17:27:05 My mom relayed the story bata pa daw sila nun. As in even getting basic commodities was a challenge.
141 2018-10-23 17:23:23 Women are commodities... no human beings.  Men and some women continue to not understand this basic notion...in 2018.  Unbelievable
142 2018-10-23 17:23:03 The Filipino people needs more social programs to improve their lives from poverty! Job creation! Unemployment Benefits once job lost, Workers Compensation for those job related injuries! Affordable prices of basic commodities!
143 2018-10-23 17:22:41 Não, a crise de 2008 foi causada pela bolha especulativa de imóveis e commodities, na qual o Brasil teve sua pequena contribuição através do pré sal especulativo do Sr Eike Batista em conluio com o PT.

160 2018-10-23 16:57:45 If you're armchair GM'ing prospects "untouchable" out of the top 25-30 (prospects out of 100), for legitimate star production now for proven commodities, you're doing it wrong. And may God have mercy on your soul.
161 2018-10-23 16:57:29 My View: At first everything collapses including crypto cause everybody just wants to get out of all --> cashout! Timewise hard to say but commodities like silver gold and crypto will be the first and fastest to recover so I think that will be the true safe havens! (+real estate)
162 2018-10-23 16:56:28 Vos hablas de empobrecer, caradura? Uds que dejaron 30% de pobres pese a tener el contexto nacional más favorable por los commodities en las nubes? Uds. que se NEGARON a medir la pobreza?
163 2018-10-23 16:56:05 Never really traded forex, started off with metal futures, then oil and commodities. But if there is something I learned this year when I bought my first bitcoins, don't be a slave to the market, hunt for the opportunity
164 2018-10-23 16:55:24 Problem is what tradable commodities do they really have
165 2018-10-23 16:51:16 When I run college football we are going back to the old time bowl system and bowls will only be allowed to be named after local commodities grown in that area.
166 2018-10-23 16:43:35 Government  has resolved to temporarily suspended Statutory Instrument 122 of 2017 to allow companies and individuals to import some basic commodities currently in short supply.
167 2018-10-23 16:41:26 It will be ok one day man. I ve seen situations where all commodities are available when i had not even a dime in my pocket.
168 2018-10-23 16:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
169 2018-10-23 16:37:03 O sea, si no siguen tu regla o ley, que no tengo claro cuál es, no son commodities pero si la siguen son commodities. Y me querés explicar que lo que pasa es porque son commodities. ¿Cuál parte está mal?
170 2018-10-23 16:36:27 #sustainableagriculture  agricultural commodities remains uncertain.  Agriculture has to meet this challenge, mainly by increasing production on land already in use and by avoiding further encroachment on land.
@DukeOfLife @CusoIntl
171 2018-10-23 16:34:34 Otra vez, pone en duda, en vez de preguntar. Pto Bs As es caro sobretodo por costos operación Por eso, sigue siendo caro aún a pesar de esa baja. Los de operación se corrigen eliminando regulaciones. Esos no son commodities, pero no los afecta el ajuste del TCN.
172 2018-10-23 16:28:16 No worries, hopefully I see you in some other bizarre place in the future. FYI, bombarded one of your partners with effusive praise of your commodities knowledge, so please toss a few sats to the people who believed in you w/no real basis other than tweets when you make rainmaker
173 2018-10-23 16:27:23 For those who followed my advice and shorted Crude, took profit early, as it is tumbling over $3.00 a barrel with the indexes. Looking for Crude Oil to be in the 58-62 range by next spring!!!! Last 66.25 a barrel. "Too many bulls." Filled on Oats. #Commodities #Crude #Oil #Stocks
174 2018-10-23 16:27:12 Ya le explique a q responde la baja del "costo de exportación". Es más que nada x simplificación administrativa, se eliminaron e unificaron controles duplicados. Los otros costos son servicios terminales (commodities) y costos de operación (hs hombre de tripulación y combustible)
175 2018-10-23 16:26:48 Socialist philosophy is dangerous sir, data is now one of the cheapest commodities in zim in US terms...I hear your point though
176 2018-10-23 16:24:53 Need an afternoon pick-me-up? How about some trivia inspired by our Trade Commissioner in Spain, @CanadaSpain1! True or false: frozen octopus is one of the top commodities imported by Spain:
177 2018-10-23 16:22:49 They have a saying that volatility is usually a sign of topping action-and we have seen plenty of it here lately. Stay short the Bubble Indexes with stops above recent highs.

178 2018-10-23 16:19:26 To curb the #pricemadness, Gvt has intervened and repealed SI 122 of 2017, as such people can now buy commodities outside Zim without licences! Some of the goods incl cooking oil, cereals, sugar, lotions,baked beans! prices will certainly go down very soon.
179 2018-10-23 16:19:24 @acielumumba very effective in 3 days 
- exposed some corruption within the govt 
- rbz directors suspended 
- import restrictions on basic commodities lifted
180 2018-10-23 16:18:36 
181 2018-10-23 16:17:38 How are the importers going to charge those commodities. Are they still going to be sold using ecocash swipe or bond
182 2018-10-23 16:15:48 That's a good move by govt this then means that the basic commodities were actually not available and it spells out allegations that these commodities were being hidden by business people
183 2018-10-23 16:13:42 This is the simplest thesis: 
—Amoral Capitalist—

Soros uses his billions to manipulate things like currencies and commodities, harming communities and businesses along the way, so that he can ride the short and buy the dip.
184 2018-10-23 16:05:40 E surfou no crescimento gigante da China e consequente aumento do preço das commodities. Já no segundo mandato sua vigarice e incompetência apareceu. Culminado com o desastre Dilma até 2016. Algum livro de história há de contar a verdade.
185 2018-10-23 16:01:09 Tweeted about this over a week ago and completely changed my portfolio to commodities about the same. Problem is...99% of people on CT have never invested a day in their lives before crypto so you're basically talking to a bunch of plebs lol.
186 2018-10-23 15:55:59 We can send help "in kind" then.  The actual commodities rather than just cash.  Would get to the people rather than get sucked up and burned off by the crooked political hacks.
187 2018-10-23 15:54:41 Is GoZ providing you with forex to import that cereal, cooking oil, body creams, soap and other commodities? Where are you going to get FOREX?
188 2018-10-23 15:53:40 So this means these will be allowed to sell on USD? What impact does this have on local industry and are there control measures to ensure tht locally-made commodities will be sold in bond? Looks like the bond is being phased out indirectly  but this will put pressure on the rates
189 2018-10-23 15:51:22 AGRO 2025 is having an all star guest lecturer mini-series discussing specific commodities. A big thank you to Drs. Spivey (soybean), Copes (cotton), Lazaro (corn), Harrell (rice), and Orgeron (sugarcane). #LSUWeedScience

192 2018-10-23 15:47:11 Applauding the Government of Zimbabwe for repealing Statutory Instrument 122 of 2017 & allowing individuals & companies to import much needed basic commodities amidst artificial shortages created by economic saboteurs & forex hoarders.
Good work.
@InfoMinZW
193 2018-10-23 15:44:55 Haiboo, thot the shortages were caused by panic buying. So after importing the commodities using forex-, how will they restock when they r expected to sell in bollars ?
194 2018-10-23 15:42:17 Farmers are terrified. What’s not widely known is that many have 2nd jobs and rely on EU subsidy. 

Neo liberal policies don’t work when it comes to basic commodities such as food.  Can’t see many people happy to pay £7 for a bag of potatoes etc.
195 2018-10-23 15:39:41 I started making a lot more money investing/trading stocks and commodities once I quit trying to predict the future and I started studying the present.
196 2018-10-23 15:37:47 Claro, pensaría que lo más difícil es la venta de Commodities a Futuro, los volúmenes son grandes y las condiciones de entrega, difícilmente un solo empresario del campo está en posibilidad de satisfacer la demanda.

199 2018-10-23 15:34:13 Folks still want to add nrg on any dip and SAF to dip toes into PRMs.  The obvious investor flow for PRMs comes from the nat resource funds that rotate within the broader materials/commodities areas out of XLB, XME, XLE et al and shovel a few billion into the tiny sliver of PMs
200 2018-10-23 15:32:57 The tax cut funded stock buy back hasn’t compensated for hawkishness and military adventurism? Maybe move more factories to Exploit oppressed workers? Support dictators for cheap commodities? Capitalism running out of things to exploit.

202 2018-10-23 15:30:05 Ever noticed that aside from the wealthiest in the country,  most of the local businessmen are also Chinese/Chinese origin? ...especially in the commodities' and retail industry. 
203 2018-10-23 15:21:35 We don't buy petroleum products from Montana or Washington. That's an ok theory but in large we export commodities and will not add processing them by crippling ourselves
204 2018-10-23 15:18:43 Here in California, it's impossible to live off 11/hr. When all our commodities are higher priced that the average. California needs something like 30$/hr to make a decent living.
205 2018-10-23 15:11:37 Just a temporary measure. No longterm solution. Povo will be smiling when basic commodities flood shops but the bond to forex rate will sky rocket, goods will not be affordable.
206 2018-10-23 15:11:24 While its good news for import revenue collection. I smell a hike on the import tarrifs of basic commodities, we gon be hit still.

208 2018-10-23 15:06:45 I was in the suburbs and saw a store that exclusively sold trampolines. It was in one of those fancy strip malls. Which got me thinking. How does a trampoline store stay in business? It’s not really one of those high turnover commodities. What they might sell like 4 a week maybe?
209 2018-10-23 15:01:48 You're practically adding a left-shooting version of David Pastrnak...

221 2018-10-23 14:34:33 For this reason, substantial future growth in the production of the chips
is impossible. This results in the commoditization of chips, meaning they become

224 2018-10-23 14:19:38 Mas dá pra enriquecer exportando commodities. Austrália e Nova Zelândia que o digam. Basta ser produtivo.
225 2018-10-23 14:14:52 I already gave you the answer. You seem to not grasp that crude oil and gasoline are two completely different commodities with completely different markets.

To appreciate the difference, why not buy yourself a barrel of crude and try to make your own gasoline from it? Good luck.

242 2018-10-23 13:47:48 It’s actually a service and the insurance most commonly used to pay for that service is a commodity. Deregulation of that commodity would drive down its cost as it does with all commodities. But you do your socialism thing man, you do you

246 2018-10-23 13:39:16 Many like cryptos being called commodities, for ‘capital gain declaration’ purposes and less regulation. However, Satoshi’s intention was for #bitcoin to be used as a currency, not a store of value. That is what the banks and regulators are really afraid of. For now.

251 2018-10-23 13:19:56 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.

271 2018-10-23 11:48:56 We’re on the same page with regards to consuming our own oil. But to make this a Saudi related issue I believe is a stretch.  And of course they can purchase poorly made trucks from countries like Russia, China or India.  Finished goods versus commodities, there’s a difference
272 2018-10-23 11:48:22 Yes! The entitlement vs commodities language is a clear marker of neoliberalism. It treats the ed of children as a potentially disposable good...and it isn’t. This is very interesting to me and I’d love to dig deeper. This affects the US and the UK in contextual yet related ways.

279 2018-10-23 11:12:31 We should do that with every country we subsidize. What are we paying them for? We should either get commodities or support of some kind. Why the free lunch when we could use this money for our own citizens from which the money was stolen as taxation to begin with?

295 2018-10-23 09:23:28 I disagree. Tokenisation creates transferable value. This can be applied to securities, commodities, rights, services or anything that is of value.

350 2018-10-23 03:33:38 I guess my posts aren't doing much to bring back the love, but anyone who approves of sexual predators in or out of office Or treating women like commodities I want nothing to do with.
351 2018-10-23 03:29:48 y no pagaron las deudas la pobrez ala llevaron al 50 y toda la asistencia social fue 1 kg de leche y 3 huevos pata menores de6 años Se quedaron con los ahorros, no pagaron la deuda y los commodities se fueron a las nubes. Si te quejaba terminaba s como coasteki
352 2018-10-23 03:23:20 And by the way, you’re talking about 2 different things. There’s a difference between food items & nourishment. Just like there’s a difference between health services & healthcare. The former are commodities. The latter are required for survival. Everyone has a right to survive.
353 2018-10-23 03:22:53 GOLD IS KING.
SILVER is 2nd

These two commodities Trump all others.

How do we know? Ask Hillary what was taken when they killed Gadaffi?
354 2018-10-23 03:22:37 O país deu um salto industrial e cresceu com os Commodities.
Aí veio a Lava Jato, desespero do Congresso corrupto e sabotagem de Cunha do governo (desastroso) de Dilma! 2014 caiu a casa!
E Ciro Gomes? Fez a parte dele!
Fez por seu estado, cresceu o IDH 6% e PIB 1,8% ao ano.
355 2018-10-23 03:20:42 where is the balance between essentialism and custom commodities, more essential commodities
356 2018-10-23 02:45:02 Hey Alex. Great video! I'm a fan of @BullionAinslie for buying physical metals in my SMSF. Plus I get crypto for my SMSF through Coinspot. Can you please point me to a place I can buy into other shares/commodities through Super - specifically URA (Uranium ETF)? Thanks
357 2018-10-23 02:43:31 Faz falta não, da nem pra trocar seguidores em commodities :/
358 2018-10-23 02:37:20 "To-day the world obtains commodities of excellent quality at prices which even the generation preceding this would have deemed incredible." And compare that to now with the ease of which things are mass produced at such low prices #AuburnWorldHistory
359 2018-10-23 02:36:49 I don’t know if there is such a level, but halving it would be nice. About 30% of exports are commodities. If you take away either natural gas or CPO, our trade surplus basically disappears

361 2018-10-23 02:24:52 Gives justification for trading away 1st Rd picks for known commodities
362 2018-10-23 02:23:51 Again accomplishments?!!! Really? Where? Soaring prices of basic commodities-, minimum fare-10pesos, Build3x-where?, drugs/crime in 6 mos-what happened?, China-unacceptable!!!
363 2018-10-23 02:21:05 Commodities Trading Results (B) - Gold:-

364 2018-10-23 02:19:55 o fato da Venezuela não investir em indústria de base, pra no mínimo suprir o país atrapalhou bastante,o valor das importações quase ultrapassava oq o país exportava de petróleo,itens até básicos inclusive,investir em produção de outros commodities...

366 2018-10-23 02:07:42 Angelini no es Cantard. No disfruta de los commodities del Cambiemos 2017. Candidatazo a pegarse la trompa contra el Monumento
367 2018-10-23 02:01:48 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
368 2018-10-23 02:01:42 + caso contrário vamos pra sempre ser o país do futuro, exportador de commodities, sem tecnologia e atividade industrial. Ao invés de estradas, pq não investir em ferrovias e hidrovias? N precisa desmatar mais pra desenvolver. Parece q o único gasto q o povo quer é com segurança
369 2018-10-23 01:59:35 @karthikrangappa sir i m new to commodities if i m right to sumarize that comm like silver, copper, lead you can trade on technical analysis alone and not required to mixed fundamentals or other economic data for it? Hope you can clear this for me..
370 2018-10-23 01:54:28 A wise man told me this: There are two commodities in life, time & money. Your life is to figure out which is more important.
371 2018-10-23 01:51:17 acho q eh isso, já q a maioria dos países q compram as commodities brasileiras já declararam aversão ao bolsonaro
372 2018-10-23 01:40:31 I’m dubious they will actually deliver. Having said that - a lot easier to deliver bitcoin than gold silver. So not much barriers to deliver unlike physical metals/commodities
373 2018-10-23 01:35:35 Market Update - Another mixed session for ag commodities overnight; with wheat giving back yesterday’s gains and then some on the back of a stronger USD, whilst corn and soybeans inched into the green.
374 2018-10-23 01:35:32 "It's extraordinary how the #NRL has relationships with unhealthy commodities such as #alcohol, #tobacco and #gambling. @MichaelTThorn talks to @BBM987 on #EndAlcAdInSport
375 2018-10-23 01:29:23 No sólo eso, muchos son commodities. Ergo, mas que bajar el precio, mejora la la rentabilidad. Lo que mejoró en el Pto BA tuvo mucho q ver con eficiencia de controles estatatles, cosas que estaban duplicadas y se fueron unificando. Igual sigue siendo caro por un tema de acceso.
376 2018-10-23 01:26:53 ¿En el mercado de commodities las depreciaciones de las monedas no repercuten en los precios?
377 2018-10-23 01:25:11 En el mercado de commodities el productor fija precio? O toma precio?
378 2018-10-23 01:23:32 It's an anarchism from a time when people were valued as individuals and our society respected the family, not as commodities of human capital. So instead of working people who had no choice but to flog themselves to death we collectively decided to create a disincentive for that
379 2018-10-23 01:21:30 Commodities prices as of now: 

Spot Gold: 1,225.70

380 2018-10-23 01:15:35 Se fijan en todo el mundo en USD y hay hasta rankings. Pero no me crea, hay toda una literaura al respecto, rankings etc. Son servicios tipo commodities para container de exportacion. De ahi la unidad de medida estandarizada. Muchos son en % del valor de la carga incluso.
381 2018-10-23 01:11:03 Coffee futures are the most intriguing of the commodities.. Free fall
382 2018-10-23 01:01:55 Estimado en la construcción, salvo la mano de obra y el precio de la tierra, el resto de los costos de materiales son practicamente commodities. Dolar barato o caro es relativo si la devaluación termina pasando a precio, al final del camino estamos igual.
383 2018-10-23 00:59:40 Just changed my entire portfolio to commodities. $URA, $SLV, $GLD, Metal mining.
384 2018-10-23 00:53:36 American farmers are seeing economic losses as a result from the U.S.-China trade dispute.  All agricultural commodities are at risk. How is that a good thing?  Do you damn research!
385 2018-10-23 00:49:52 They have viable commodities to trade. Bills…do not.
386 2018-10-23 00:47:21 Perhaps you don't know much about nationalism.  You certainly don't know what caused every war ever.  Most wars are for land or commodities meaning oil.
387 2018-10-23 00:37:25 I know who Queen B is, It’s BOB, yapera. Start fixing the economy rather than taking us away from the reality of the 2% tax, fuel shortages, basic commodities shortages.
388 2018-10-23 00:35:58 While centralized entities like @coinbase and @binance chase assets that appeal to get rich quick schemers, real commodities like #vertcoin get overlooked.  Why?  Its real cryptocurrencies like $VTC that threaten to upend the establishment.
389 2018-10-23 00:33:42 Sequía, Trump, guerra comercial China - EEUU, precios de los commodities más bajos en décadas. Cambiemos no es un gobierno de inútiles. Es un gobierno de inútiles sin suerte.
390 2018-10-23 00:23:43 Yes I agree. The small family generational farms are unfortunately going through this again. Canada and the USA farms that are small will not survive because of price of commodities they sell.
391 2018-10-23 00:21:57 Congrats to Benneton for allowing peoples of all colors and races to be encouraged by the fashion industry to buy slave labor commodities.
392 2018-10-23 00:17:31 To me,it very small compare to the high increase in terms of commodities,feedings,transportation,clothings etc,
i believe that the minimum wage of an average working class citizen should be enough carter for for his/her basic needs...to me 24000,is too small
393 2018-10-23 00:15:07 To me,it very small compare to the high increase in terms of commodities,feedings,transportation,clothings etc,
i belive
394 2018-10-23 00:12:11 Most livestock operations large or small do a very good job of reclaiming and recycling nutrient waste. Livestock sewage (your term) is loaded with N, P , K and S along with all other micronutrients. These valuable commodities are recycled to the soil for crop production
395 2018-10-23 00:09:55 "[Nossa proposta] seria uma volta ao passado, quando o Brasil tinha uma participação elevada no mercado internacional e os manufaturados tinham peso importante da pauta exportadora, hoje dominada por commodities", disse Castro, [Associação de Comércio Exterior do Brasil], à Folha
