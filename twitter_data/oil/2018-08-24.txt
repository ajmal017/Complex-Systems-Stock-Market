41 2018-08-24 23:56:11 Canada, like every other country with centralized power structures, has its own issues and complexities. But it would be nice to get healthcare subsidized a bit more in this country. Kind of like oil and gas or military tech get subsidized.

50 2018-08-24 23:53:45 So instead of Energy East bringing oil from the west, they would rather keep Eastern Canada reliant on imported oil from Saudi Arabia?

Great logic there folks.
51 2018-08-24 23:53:36 This oil spill on 880 got me bent.. 92 is not moving 
52 2018-08-24 23:53:32 And why should you get that protection while others don't?  Shall we protect Canadian oil workers with 270% tariffs on foreign oil and pay $4/litre for gasoline?
53 2018-08-24 23:53:26 I’d say luck is on Trumps side. By the way, still waiting on that collusion/election rigging with the help of Russia proof liberals claim exist, along with unicorns, fairies, and liberals with three digit IQ’s.

57 2018-08-24 23:52:07 It's in their best interest to destroy the company. Then oil cars can run for a decade longer. We need more competition. Everything is concentrated on one company. It doesn't help that Elon is not great with delegation, he likes taking things head on.
58 2018-08-24 23:52:06 Meanwhile, Texas is asking taxpayers for $12,000,000,000 for a sea wall to protect the oil industry that helped cause sea level rise. That is going to cost us a lot more than whatever we saved from the tax cut.

88 2018-08-24 23:47:11 Hi, Raelene. Supervision inspected the area and found that a bag with motor oil was thrown into a garbage can. The item has been removed and the area cleaned. Thanks again! ^DG
89 2018-08-24 23:47:08 I think a better question is, what is our oil?
90 2018-08-24 23:47:05 It obviously took him a while to turn the oil tanker that was #bcafc around, but after that we were well motoring for a few years under his stewardship.

94 2018-08-24 23:46:29 Absent those answers I do not see how they can state that we do not need the pipeline capacity. They upgraded capacity is intended to replace the loss in supply from Alaska and to avoid us having to use massive amounts of oil-by-rail to address current and future needs. 3/

96 2018-08-24 23:46:25 That original study may as well have been posted in The Onion.  It’s actually been discussed a lot over the last couple of weeks.  Its data is pretty flaky.  Same thing with the “coconut oil will kill you” report. 
97 2018-08-24 23:46:04 The company you’ve worked for 20 years like you said caused a direct problem. You think a young boy is going to choose school over an oil company promising ridiculous money and the golden life? And I’m the stupid one?

107 2018-08-24 23:44:06 I worked one of the fire seasons in the mountains. I was on an oil crew and if we came upon a fire we had to work it. It was 1985 and had been considered the worst fire at that time

113 2018-08-24 23:43:10 Green energy needs subsidies to level the playing field against all the subsidies the oil industry gets. That or end oil subsidies and pay the true cost of a litre of gasoline around the $8 dollar litre mark
114 2018-08-24 23:43:08 India suggested at AFDB 2017 that it expects trade with Africa to reach $100bn in the next couple of years.  this is optimistic without a rebound in oil prices, but India is undoubtedly becoming more important; it is a top five trading partner for a large number of SSA economies.
115 2018-08-24 23:43:07 To clarify, what do they say about the supply and demand dynamic in the Pacific Northwest. On the supply-side, where do they project the refineries in the Puget Sound will be getting their crude oil from and where do they see BC will be getting its refined fuels from? 1/
116 2018-08-24 23:43:04 Sometimes yes. If I want to smell like mustard for the night. I also use Olive Oil.

124 2018-08-24 23:41:57 Explain. I get baking soda, but I don't get vegetable oil. Oil defeats oil?
125 2018-08-24 23:41:52 I  Aunt Mid jar sauces. Use Mom's doctoring trick though. Make her homemade sauce base: soften garlic in olive oil, stir in Contadina tomato sauce with Italian spices until it darkens, add jar of sauce, fresh basil, oregano, tsp sugar, simmer about an hour.
126 2018-08-24 23:41:45 I used to, but don’t anymore.  I just put a little olive oil on it and rub it around now.  Sometimes, the mustard could make the rub cake, which I’m not a fan of.

136 2018-08-24 23:40:20 Hell, the only way for you to not use an oil based product is for you to move to the middle of no where, grow your own food, build a house out of mud and sticks and learn how to make clay pots.

158 2018-08-24 23:37:22 This is not the first time @HarvardChanSPH doctors criticize coconut oil...what’s on their mind and are they properly trained? There is no such pure evil food and everything should be consumed in moderation.
159 2018-08-24 23:37:08 Park Trident on your doorstep, mismanage oil industry, sell off your assets and keep the cash and assign tax from Scots whisky to the Treasury. Create policies such as migration that prevent the population growth so needed. #UnequalUnion

161 2018-08-24 23:36:59 Confirmed lies? Liar?  Guess you were asleep for eight years while Obama lied and walked all over the Constitution. Plenty of those lies that actually hurt this nation & cost lives. But that’s ok because he was a slick snake oil salesman that the msm and Hollywood adored.
162 2018-08-24 23:36:52 The New York Yankees are Freemason clones conducting a hyper-sigil!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
163 2018-08-24 23:36:29 It's actually the mono-cropping that destroys the soil, causing erosion. Not the pastured ruminants. It's the ruminants that save the soil from further depletion and help in turn to clean the water run off. Droughts caused by ghg from big industries like oil and manufacturing.
164 2018-08-24 23:36:16 Polynesia, Samoa, Cook Islands, Philippines, Seychelles, Maldives, Mauritius, Ceylon n possibly a few more.. have all been surviving on coconut oil for centuries, AND having lived in the Seychelles Islands, I’ve been told that many people as young as 30 plus

"Venezuela’s min wage was recently equivalent to about $1/mo, and a cup of coffee hit to 2,000,000 bolivars at one point in July, equivalent to almost $17 USD, a Bloomberg report said."

THIS IN A COUNTRY THAT HAD FULL SCALE OIL RESOURCES!!!
197 2018-08-24 23:30:23 Hmm...

How about diced skillet roasted potatoes as a side? Cook em in butter until GBD and sprinkle with salt, and maybe some truffle oil.

220 2018-08-24 23:26:48 Beto has had that nickname since he was a child living in a primarily Hispanic neighborhood where Beto was the nickname for Robert.

224 2018-08-24 23:25:42 Based on the data, not opinion, a vast majority of scientists concur that human activity as exacerbated the effects of climate change. Where did you get your degree? I will take their word over that of a bunch of self serving oil and coal fatcats.
225 2018-08-24 23:25:40 Mustard oil, it has omega3 to omega6 ratio of 1:1, best cooking oil. Olive has ratio 1:1 not good. Soy oil worst 1:16, run away from it.
226 2018-08-24 23:25:38 Look at central Africa. Several of those countries are rich with oil and no one is touching it. Why do you think that is?
227 2018-08-24 23:25:25 I wouldn't underestimate him. His chances are definitely low but on the ground here in TX there is real grassroots enthusiasm for him. He's already doing much better than the last liberal media darling Wendy Davis ever did. An upset wouldn't completely shock me anymore.

237 2018-08-24 23:24:05 I listened to a sci-fi audiobook a few years ago, which told the story of a world where a microbe of some sort was used to consume an oil slick, and ended up eating all of the petroleum products on the planet. Needless to say, society came crashing down.

280 2018-08-24 23:18:17 You've morphed into a petro-dollar MIC/bankster run empire. It's unsustainable. When the linkage between oil & the dollar's greatly reduced, you'll collapse, same as all empires do, as the forced buying of your debt via T-bills, etc, & leverage via the dollar FOREX will cease.

The foolish virgins apparently had some oil in their lamps to begin with—they just don’t have enough supply to get them to His arrival. Why do you think they didn’t bring “extra” oil?

295 2018-08-24 23:16:20 The problem is we don't publish scientific study. Just yesterday, I found that mustard has omega3 to 6 ratio as 1:1, one of the best cooking oil. Yet olive oil is so well marketed. Why can't our scientist establish and we follow.
296 2018-08-24 23:16:15 Question. Do I have any FB friends that have been curious about trying CBD oil but haven’t taken the plunge yet?? I am looking for 3 people to split a package with me so we can get the discount??
297 2018-08-24 23:16:12 สัสเอ้ยยยย

300 2018-08-24 23:15:39 try olive oil or less butter.  That to me seems like too much

I cry
306 2018-08-24 23:14:37 just don’t use things that are labeled oil free. I embrace oil
307 2018-08-24 23:14:36 So what is the healthy oil in their perspective?
308 2018-08-24 23:14:29 OUR FUTURE he has screwed up trade. He has allowed POISEN that causes cancer back on  food. The water from POISEN flows into the stream kills fish and anything that eats them Coal WHYscrewing up USA for oil. NOT OUR FUTURE is solar. It is his greedy friends from other countries.

313 2018-08-24 23:14:06 They don't rule out oil sands, they rule out high sulphur fuel oil. Most processed oil sands goes through full conversion upgraders or refineries. Will have an impact but not catastrophic.
314 2018-08-24 23:14:05 Oh, yeah that stuff is gross. Are you a flavoured (toffee, chilli, cheese etc), plain or an oily? Either supermarket oil or homemade

316 2018-08-24 23:13:53 Wife : I’m cooking today at 6
Me: Okay
6pm: She start washing dishes, sweep, mop, change car oil,change tires,change the roof of the house, built a new bathroom and 2 hours later 
**she finally start cooking *** 
317 2018-08-24 23:13:45 I have an oil diffuser in every room of this apartment. That’s how it’s posed to be ok
318 2018-08-24 23:13:41 oh i never said anything about not expecting this, in fact i expect this out of you 

i just needed to reiterate how appalling the concept of cooking oil ice cubes are
319 2018-08-24 23:13:36 people pray for cake but when God gives them batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and a oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen , how bad do you really want it?
320 2018-08-24 23:13:04 They hit the ownership lottery, pure and simple. They were absolutely the Mets to Man Utd's Yankees until oil money was looking for a plaything and Man City was a club in a big city in a big footballing country with opportunities to grow. And now they're cream of the crop.

327 2018-08-24 23:12:12 @doddleoddle hi, I just saw about the mouse in your room on your insta stories. Try putting peppermint oil around the rooms, on like cotton swabs or dilute with water and spray it. It's meant to keep mice and spiders away

329 2018-08-24 23:12:10 I'm afraid that this isn't the right read. China will never allow an US friendly regime at it's border. They have Kim in a vice. China is openly defying us by agreeing to buying a bunch of oil from Iran and we aren't doing anything about it.

I leave the bathroom for 5 MINUTES, come back,  and this heffa climbed in the tub! I mean pulled her toys in and everything! “Is this for me?” 

I guess it is now! SHIT!
335 2018-08-24 23:11:00 You’re right. What you haven’t acknowledged is mental health issues. A gun by itself is harmless. A rope will never strangle or hang a person without someone helping it.  Ban rope and oil!  Let’s see how far your “ban everything “ movement goes. U won’t win this! It’s over 4U!
336 2018-08-24 23:10:56 According to the @ColoradoSun @PolisForCO didn’t answer oil and gas questions, but @WalkerStapleton did.

344 2018-08-24 23:10:13 So when an illegal immigrant kills someone, it’s somehow worse than when a red-blooded, clean-cut American boy kills his family and stuffs his little girls into oil drums? 
Those are not the words of “the left...they’re the words of a human being.
345 2018-08-24 23:09:55 Are these funds from #TheFightPack being used to support Dems who are already being bought by "BIG" oil, pharma, insurance? Or, are these funds going to clean candidates, free of corporate influence?  Need to answer before I donate. #basta
346 2018-08-24 23:09:34 Actually, olive oil doesn't help with stickiness. I learned that from Bojack Horseman.
347 2018-08-24 23:09:33 And before you say 'muh oil subsidy' know that i'd end ALL subsidy tomorrow if it were up to me.
348 2018-08-24 23:09:21 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.

350 2018-08-24 23:09:17 Eww, yeah, ditch the spray, just use Olive oil or peanut oil (if you want things flavorless)
351 2018-08-24 23:09:14 There's absolutely no way out

We've passed impeachment threshold hundreds of crimes, lies, and sex scandals ago

355 2018-08-24 23:09:13 Nah, I think it just makes him look like a snake oil salesman with a new gig.
356 2018-08-24 23:09:08 I’m sitting here watching this mans change my oil and shit and he all dirty from working & lawddd... i kinda wanna smash... again.. LMAO
357 2018-08-24 23:09:05 No one but badbo would change their oil on the truck in Calvin Klein jeans, fcking rockstar
358 2018-08-24 23:08:57 You're chalking up decades of climate science to a "narrative" and you believe shills for the oil industry instead. There is oodles of evidence to disprove each of your bogus claims but you reject every single one based on your conspiracy that all scientists lie.
359 2018-08-24 23:08:56 We had a oil leak in the apartment...we good though luv
360 2018-08-24 23:08:48 If he truly believes this, it just shows what a great country America is that someone this dumb can get so rich.

362 2018-08-24 23:08:40 Ahhhhhh... a new batch of conspirators :) I understand scepticism about US sciences but many of us are very independent of politics and contracts.

how do you account for INTERNATIONAL agencies and their scientists agreeing? Even oil companies are on board.
363 2018-08-24 23:08:35 Fresh bread with olive oil and spices is just a little better than fresh bread.   Maybe that’s default within “fresh bread”???   Yum!
364 2018-08-24 23:08:33 International law? How do you think they'd go about taking control of the oil rigs? Gun boats?
365 2018-08-24 23:08:29 The pan isn't that hot.

Hrm.

Other thought: I'm using a kind of crappy nonstick oil spray, which may taste funky

408 2018-08-24 23:00:51 This is, of course, on top of the $26 billion or so Big Oil gets in subsidies from the USA government every year.  $100 billion in fossil foolish subsidies globally every year NRDC estimates.

420 2018-08-24 22:59:48 Those things were fucking investigated. You know what’s illegal? Paying  off porn stars with campaign money. Not paying taxes. Embezzling from a CHARITY.

424 2018-08-24 22:59:27 This is an incomplete thought. Smoking weed for how long has this effect? Are they referring to THC, CBD, with a filter, as an oil, with specific paper, specific nutrients.....?
425 2018-08-24 22:59:01 That he’s doing to the environment? Didn’t the Dakota pipeline protesters leave 48 million pounds of trash behind? Wasn’t Obama president during the BP oil spill that dumped 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico? The environment has been in chaos for decades now.
426 2018-08-24 22:58:58 Someone told me that’s an oil beetle.
427 2018-08-24 22:58:49 I used tea tree oil to help mine when it got bad!
428 2018-08-24 22:58:46 True - also better to hedge or dump these equities since the Norwegian economy is long oil.

432 2018-08-24 22:58:02 No issue with avoiding Saudi oil but western Canadian producers can't supply eastern refineries with light crude even with Energy East. They are not configured to take our heavy crude. Imports are still required.

435 2018-08-24 22:57:35 Olive oil is the fat of my ancestors and there is always a litre of it on our dining table. I tend to BBQ most protein foods (so no need to add fat there except in the marinade) and drizzled on grilled veggies.
436 2018-08-24 22:57:31 I did cubes of firm tofu, a jalapeno, a bit of onion, sauteed all that together. Microwaved a steam bag of cauliflower rice, threw that in and sauteed a bit, then added some vinegar, soy sauce, sambal, and sesame oil. Oh and some scramby egg!

438 2018-08-24 22:57:28 Babies are known to be clingy. That’s why the oil was first developed, to help remove infants you just don’t want to deal with. The fact it works on so many other sticky things is a testament to its development. 
439 2018-08-24 22:57:13 Of course the present administration has a huge deficiency in terms of economy, but I think the problem we have is how we can stabilize exchange rate, fuel price, Non oil foreign investment, and reducing our debt profile.

449 2018-08-24 22:55:52 I am absolutely certain you know nothing about the oil and gas industry in Alberta with that tweet. Canada’s  oil and Gas is the most highly regulated in the world, with the highest safety records globally. Every company aims at zero manhours lost to injury, most come close.
450 2018-08-24 22:55:32 What oil*
451 2018-08-24 22:55:19 Yeah they're in my future. They have to be bathed once a week and wear clothes in winter that have to be washed because of the skin oil. None of which I will mind.

456 2018-08-24 22:54:45 Since when Muslim Brotherhood is selling oil?
457 2018-08-24 22:54:42 The second reason is an extreme dollar shortage caused by the collapse in oil production and prices and by over-borrowing during the boom years: at over 600 per cent

492 2018-08-24 22:48:59 @Saturday could one of your experts please explain how cold pressed coconut oil is made? By the time oil develops in a coconut, the coconut must be mature and semi dried? Potentially rancid and full of saturated fat as well?
493 2018-08-24 22:48:58 White Colorado man killed his pregnant wife and two daughters. He put his flesh and blood daughters in oil tankers. Where's Mo's outrage? He a racist and anyone who retweets is also a racist or watches FOX day and night.
494 2018-08-24 22:48:55 Searing & braising spicy Mexican AND making Sichuan chili oil at the same time is apparently too much for the smoke alarm
495 2018-08-24 22:48:39 You know you’re an adult when you feel happy that you got an oil change and your tire fixed  can I be 6 again????????
496 2018-08-24 22:47:54 I like to slice them thin and grill them. I like to use all the "McCormick grill mates" marinades. All you need is water, oil or vinegar and mix in the powder and put the chicken in a ziplock bag

498 2018-08-24 22:47:51 These ladies are totally dumb when it comes to finding solutions like that. They'd rather just have someone else do it. Me, I've done all the general maintenance, oil changes, and filter replacements myself on every car I've owned.
499 2018-08-24 22:47:38 They are just putting more oil in fire
He even said he will try to help her getting her internship back and all
They are idiots ( I really can't find any other word for them) who didn't do any research
500 2018-08-24 22:47:13 If it was not for mans discovery of oil and its uses over a century ago, we would still be a backwards, low technology society, with farming, hunting, fishing and logging as our key industries.  The global population would be a very small fraction of what it is now.

515 2018-08-24 22:45:09 Seriously? You think London would try to keep some of Scotland's waters and oil?
516 2018-08-24 22:44:57 False grace teachers overstate the freedom we have in Jesus. The deception that discipline, effort or vigilance have no eternal value will result in innumerable people being shocked when God says, "Depart from me, I never knew you."

555 2018-08-24 22:40:06 We've done 52 oil changes so far this month. 
For every oil change performed in August, we will donate $5 to the Foodshed Alliance.
Help us help them. There's still one week left!
556 2018-08-24 22:39:58 No chance, your country is still back in the dark ages, when the oil loses value due to electric cars, your whole economy will collapse. drop your prehistoric values and maybe in 200 years, you might actually reach the 20th century.
557 2018-08-24 22:39:52 The problem with your position is that you believe we 'need' an expansion of fossil fuels and that without it our society will cease to function. that's simply not the case. It just means less money for the oil co's.  The safest thing to do with oil/gas is leave it in the ground.
558 2018-08-24 22:39:49 I was thinking to wear my hair in two puff puffs and rock up smelling like coconut oil loooooool
559 2018-08-24 22:39:35 helo i have olive oil in my ear how is ur night goin

562 2018-08-24 22:38:57 He apparently doesn’t even use dressing. Just oil and vinegar.
563 2018-08-24 22:38:46 whatever it is, someone has found a way to add cbd oil
564 2018-08-24 22:38:33 Does anyone know the best (reasonably priced if poss!) cbd oil. No thc, would kill my dizziness! Even a cream. 
Tired of being in agony most days 
565 2018-08-24 22:38:29 行きて〜…
566 2018-08-24 22:38:22 Cannabis Coconut body oil

567 2018-08-24 22:38:02 It does when you put it on straight after you pull them from the oil.
568 2018-08-24 22:37:53 I got the oil shit done in March and the engine blew in July! Ain’t it good for like a year??
569 2018-08-24 22:37:44 Where I get my oil changed I pay 25 dollars. Women pay 10 dollars for the same exact service. I hope on equality day the women have to pay the same 25 dollars I pay.
570 2018-08-24 22:37:34 Cooked in the same oil as haraam sausages!
571 2018-08-24 22:37:22 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
572 2018-08-24 22:37:15 @finalfantasy080 フォローありがとうございます！
573 2018-08-24 22:37:04 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
574 2018-08-24 22:37:02 Hmmmm Haliburton took a hit huh? Wonder if there was something that had to do with other oilfield service companies or them losing contracts? Cause oil isn’t losing that much ground
575 2018-08-24 22:36:56 Do u know why doraemon and dorami are siblings? Because they share the same oil
576 2018-08-24 22:36:41 Guava water + berry castor oil in my hair and on my face. Peak lusciousness.

580 2018-08-24 22:36:09 @willybronca777 Goodmorning Roberto. Burning the midnight oil. Thank you for RT.
581 2018-08-24 22:36:08 whoever stole my oil out my whip, fuck u and ya mother
582 2018-08-24 22:36:01 Hmmm never have but if you have some kinda salt solution, use that to cleanse first, aloe and some oil moisturizer or raw shea
583 2018-08-24 22:36:00 Local in Norman Bay “I want to talk about transportation, not energy”. 

Heard loud & clear.

Interestingly, transportation would solve community’s energy needs: no local gasoline, stove oil, or diesel. A road or ferry would help; allowing locals to bring fuel in.

585 2018-08-24 22:35:28 ever the 35 min wait for an oil change
586 2018-08-24 22:34:32 I think Pence joins Russian and Koch interests at the hip.  The long game being keeping the fossil fuels industry from being phased out by clean energy.  Russia's entire economy is built on oil as is the Koch's massive fortune.  Clean energy would destroy both.
587 2018-08-24 22:34:32 dump some more oil and garbage in the ocean...that'll fix the problem

If anything Xeno1 was the horniest.
591 2018-08-24 22:33:21 All that RT @KiissMyDimples: what do bald people put on their heads? lotion? oil? moisturizer?
592 2018-08-24 22:33:08 Nice myne is full of oil
593 2018-08-24 22:33:07 Harvard professor is high on something really. This is not true totally false information. In South India all my friends make food in coconut oil  and their families have been doing it for centuries. Also we all Indians put coconut oil in our hair. Nobody is dumb for sure.
594 2018-08-24 22:33:02 Intelligent people learn to give honor to whom its due,for this,its an art of intellect driven study which should be acknowledged and cited.

596 2018-08-24 22:32:58 Prayers and love for your Dad and family. I have seen postings of CBD oil, has no "high" side effects and some have had good response with brain tumors and pain relief, naturally. Just in case it might help <3
597 2018-08-24 22:32:54 Yeah. True talk bro.

601 2018-08-24 22:32:31 Motor oil is good for roses, right?
602 2018-08-24 22:32:22 We've been experimenting with cucumber chips. Cut up cukes, rinse in an oil/vinegar/salt bath, and put on dehydrator for 48 hours.
603 2018-08-24 22:32:18 Are you baking the seasoning on? If you do the soap wont remove it. The oil bonds with the iron and creates a hard layer
604 2018-08-24 22:32:06 On and off for about a year finally I tried the MCT oil and I got in and just a couple of days.
605 2018-08-24 22:32:03 what do bald people put on their heads? lotion? oil? moisturizer?

611 2018-08-24 22:31:20 Lol na tiredness
612 2018-08-24 22:30:59 @CobraBitcoin Can I interest you in some Snake Oil?

Replay protection? 

Doesn't sound very "Satoshi's Vision" to me.

All these years and it seems that you still don't get it.
613 2018-08-24 22:30:53 Thinks most refiners are now beholden to imports even the US with their  new found production are still beholden to half their oil being imports. Only some countries are lucky but even for some of those oil is a curse.
614 2018-08-24 22:30:47 Post Malone is greasier than the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
615 2018-08-24 22:30:41 Bruh you know how long you gotta go without an oil change to blow the engine?! LMFAOOOOOO
616 2018-08-24 22:30:40 Marriage is  hardwork plus Grace with  Maturity as the engine oil.
617 2018-08-24 22:30:29 time for a reminder that 99.4% of "truffle oil" is synthetic lab-created flavor molecules containing zero truffle, a scandalous fact The New York Times hauls out every 4 years like clockwork to announce as if it's new
618 2018-08-24 22:30:20 I will often use both olive oil and butter together. Some things cry for butter, others olive oil…and some things love both. Now I’m hungry again.
619 2018-08-24 22:30:20 Listen, I went to get my oil changed this morning and one of the mechanics in charge was a WOC and I s2g it made my entire day. It’s all I’ve thought about. 

And nobody was hassling her. It was amazing.
620 2018-08-24 22:30:07 Brussels sprouts are great roasted! Cut them in half, mix some olive oil and salt, spread them on a baking sheet and let them crisp up. So yummy!!
621 2018-08-24 22:30:05 Mandela supported Israel's right to exist. He was a Zionist. So supporting SA makes a country racist? So the UK and the countries that supplied SA's oil were all racist? I'm sure he didn't support the Islamofacist kleptomania that "Palestinian liberation"" has become.
622 2018-08-24 22:30:02 I purchase @MerrickPetCare Grain Free products...i also slow cook a hen with veg 2xs a month as "gravy". Fish oil pill 1x a day, also dogs  fruit and veg as treats and add-ons to food.
623 2018-08-24 22:30:02 RECEIVE A FULL BUMPER TO BUMPER INSPECTION INCLUDING BRAKES, WITH PURCHASE OF OIL CHANGE AS OUR THANKS! (WITH PROOF OF STUDENT ID RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL 10% OFF!)
624 2018-08-24 22:29:58 not sure, but make sure it has an oil, grease base to it,
625 2018-08-24 22:29:57 Do they have oil?
626 2018-08-24 22:29:53 Agh the worst . We have an open fire but our oil has also run out.
627 2018-08-24 22:29:44 That’s the magic of it in a potato salad like this with oil. Let it soak in overnight. You’ll thank me.
628 2018-08-24 22:29:37 ... oil as possible before the decline starts and prices drop.
Business 101.
629 2018-08-24 22:29:32 King Jaja of Opobo (1821–1891) founded Opobo city (now in Nigeria) in 1867 and shipped palm oil to Britain independently.
630 2018-08-24 22:29:21 Not just from cooking meat. Acrolein emissions also from vegetable oil smoke.
631 2018-08-24 22:29:07 Climate change policy directly hurt the poor!! It’s a regressive tax that only effects the poor.  How many poor folks get to buy a Tesla and get that $8k rebate!! It’s a scam!
632 2018-08-24 22:28:42 Grifter. Snake oil salesman......the Donald.
633 2018-08-24 22:28:36 Taking a magnesium supplement and fish oil with omega 3 has helped me a lot!
634 2018-08-24 22:28:30 If you think about it, what has Trump done for the Russians?  Maybe, keeping the internal combustion engine alive allows Russia to sell oil for a more premium price.  Yet, what else?  It highly suggests that it is indeed a political witch hunt.  #politics
635 2018-08-24 22:28:25 Ugh this fucking oil spill is about to make my commute that much longer!
636 2018-08-24 22:28:23 If you believe in that essential oil shit you’re the equivalent of guys going on porn sites and clicking on the “Big dick pills” ads
637 2018-08-24 22:28:22 That being said I don't know if I'll continue the longsword legacy in GU. Thinking about pouring oil all over myself with SnS or maybe hopping back to DBs or going full tryhard with CB. I know LS is pretty ezlife because I played a good amount of XX with valor LS (its busted)
638 2018-08-24 22:28:11 6017F
639 2018-08-24 22:28:08 The world will reach peak oil demand before the pipeline is finished. Why do people think the companies didn't want to finish it?
When the peak is reached, crappy oil like tar oil will be the first to collapse.
Increase in other producers is an attempt to sell as much ...
640 2018-08-24 22:27:48 my bf is changing the oil on my car, cleaning it and checking my tire pressure rn for our lil road trip and man do i love being a lazy princess 
641 2018-08-24 22:27:23 Go for it.  It's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil.
642 2018-08-24 22:27:08 Burning the midnight oil on my FPL tonight... We die here.
643 2018-08-24 22:27:06 I disagree. Lobbyists exist for everything from oil companies to diseases that only affect a handful of people. They’re all valuable in their own way. Obama won when Hillary had every dime of the DNC & Corp money behind her.
644 2018-08-24 22:27:04 You clearly are on the payroll of Big Oil.
Stop  exaggerating notingburgers.
645 2018-08-24 22:26:54 I've made butter, it's fun! Never made olive oil though, if only I lived in Tuscany ;) Yeah, I prefer the taste of olive oil tbh. But butter has a creaminess.
646 2018-08-24 22:26:46 Argan oil to tame my frizz
647 2018-08-24 22:26:45 I got the Tatcha body butter, stocked up on Beauty Blender cleansers, and got some hair oil and a couple of repurchases of foundations. It’s stock up more than anything!
648 2018-08-24 22:26:38 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
649 2018-08-24 22:26:30 Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over!
650 2018-08-24 22:26:23 I feel like guys in the oil rigs have smelly feet and snore really loud at night lol #Justme? #Sorryfortheshade
651 2018-08-24 22:26:13 Man start your day with a probiotic (you live in NYC) fish oil, and add some flax meal and chia seed to your breakfast (Cream of Wheat ... would have said oatmeal but MonsantoCo messed that up)your body will appreciate it
652 2018-08-24 22:26:08 2/2 So when you say BR was crap, bear in mind that for much of its life it was being run down by a tory government ideologically devoted to the oil and motor industries (much as the tories are running down the NHS now in favour of their preferred private insurance based model)
653 2018-08-24 22:26:02 I’m so glad I made it home before that oil spill
654 2018-08-24 22:26:00 No surprise!
Chavez abused the power and the economy to suit his political views and to continue his stay as President.
Unlike other countries that have oil deposits in abundance they did not create or save in to a wealth fund for a rainy day when exporting their oil
655 2018-08-24 22:25:52 Try MTC oil in powder form.
656 2018-08-24 22:25:40 god bless black soap + vitamin e oil tysm mamas 
657 2018-08-24 22:25:31 I want some more color on my nails but they need a break. Only almond oil, olive oil, avocado oil, and castor oil for the next 2 weeks 
658 2018-08-24 22:25:25 What kind of oil does it use? Also, does it smell something in particular?
659 2018-08-24 22:25:17 High protein, the Ensure Protien drinks are great 150 calories and 30 grams of protien, like a ribeye in a small carton. Low carbs, not no carbs, low. Lots of fruit and vegetables and of course my Vitamin D, Probiotics and Krill oil supplements.
660 2018-08-24 22:25:14 Rooster found it hard when I left the house when we first got him. We used cbd oil very successfully, and also 'relaxing dog music' on youtube. Obviously not the same degree that it sounds like Lubo has.
661 2018-08-24 22:24:58 Got an oil change and new windshield wipers. Now I’m going to get a haircut. Some more steps to helping with this depression thing. Treat yourself (and the car lol).
662 2018-08-24 22:24:54 Olive oil is key as well. My grandmother used to make her own butter. As a child, I wouldn’t touch it. Realize now what I was missing. A good drizzle of olive oil, though, can be INCREDIBLE.
663 2018-08-24 22:24:54 Aahhh godddd I love putting coconut oil on my lipssss
664 2018-08-24 22:24:52 More Majick potion for your chronic pains! Not snake oil! Real Science! Let's heal!
665 2018-08-24 22:24:51 Swear cuh be doing too much this nigga didn’t even get a oil change before I bounced now this light done came on
666 2018-08-24 22:24:48 Still haven't explained why you are seeking billions to protect Texas oil companies from Global Warming. What happened to it was fake and the free market? Guess bootstraps are only for poor ppl huh?
667 2018-08-24 22:23:57 Yes we have had 4 farm murders in the Free state province alone in a week. That included torturing of kids babies boiled in hot water or oil ect. How many o you need to not Justify large scale?
668 2018-08-24 22:23:36 I have a gig tomorrow and I’m full of cold. Gunna get high on olbas oil tonight #NoFucksGiven
669 2018-08-24 22:23:21 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
670 2018-08-24 22:23:19 And nowadays, Indians are so polite that they will even buy crude oil at much higher prices than from Iran
671 2018-08-24 22:23:06 Oh right! Butter has always been a staple for my parents, perhaps I rebelled by living off olive oil :)
672 2018-08-24 22:23:05 Intelligent people will focus on the wisdom contained in the thread, not citation, it's not project 
673 2018-08-24 22:22:28 WHY AM I BREAKING OUT DAMN OIL SERUM
674 2018-08-24 22:21:51 Thank God... Please take the job
675 2018-08-24 22:21:49 Only your women’s 
Us here in Canada didn’t and still don’t notice any “ butt” kicking
Actually we’re using your princes tantrum to our advantage in the oil industry
676 2018-08-24 22:21:45 What about tights?  What about massage oil?
677 2018-08-24 22:21:43 he’s a serial liar and a snake oil salesman.  It’s too bad that OSU didn’t have the intestinal fortitude to do the right thing.  Amazing that in 2018 that the OSU President and board members would come to such an atrocious decision to save Urban & cover up Domestic Violence
678 2018-08-24 22:21:26 Tip of the iceberg. Oil companies, construction unions who built the roads, car companies, etc.

680 2018-08-24 22:21:16 I don't know, he's been putting out a lot of feel good tweets today. Seems like, while he might be trying to keep his head down and out of Spanky's line of fire, he's also setting his sights on a certain chair in an unusually shaped room. God forbid! snake oil salesman complicit
681 2018-08-24 22:21:10 Another new happy feeling I have experienced. Changing the oil in my car by myself!!!!!! Of course with my pops supervision. Lol
682 2018-08-24 22:21:08 Then we found North Sea Oil.
683 2018-08-24 22:21:01 Apparently lavender puts flies off, kind of repels them. If you leave out lavender oil or burn lavender scented candles it should do the trick. I don’t know how true that is but it’s worth a go 
684 2018-08-24 22:20:52 I am noticing lots of fracking and oil wells in areas being hit in US. Also across the river from me in IL.
685 2018-08-24 22:20:49 I don’t think eschatology is as non-essential as people make it out to be. The foolish virgins start out with oil in their lamps (Mt 25:8), but they don’t have enough to endure until the Bridegroom arrives.
686 2018-08-24 22:20:43 The NM Democrats will never admit the 1.2 billion they now have is due to oil and gas deregulation and they should be thanking President Trump. Years going backward and now surplus. ADMIT IT DEMS
687 2018-08-24 22:20:26 I put some olive oil in a pan and just pan fry them! I put a lid on them for a little bit so it keeps the heat in and cook them for probably around 10 minutes (I’ve never actually timed it). Add some garlic and shrimp when you’re frying and it is a tastey healthy meal!
688 2018-08-24 22:20:09 You’re a creepy politician that’s owned by oil and NRA. You are a swamp thing and if Texans want a better life, they would vote for Beto #BetoForTexas
689 2018-08-24 22:20:04 It's not a "subsidy"; it's a tax treatment regarding depreciation. If you want to clean up the tax code, good luck with that, but it's not special treatment of oil. As far as I'm concerned, we should just get rid of the corporate tax, since no one knows who pays it.
690 2018-08-24 22:20:04 oil on canvas,cordiforme nunca li seus olhos confessam tb n
691 2018-08-24 22:19:59 Changed oil in the car now what to do
692 2018-08-24 22:19:38 Damn, I didn't know he was told her address and all that. I knew Trisha had found him and was talking to him, and that oil life wife was deleting her channel/going private on here, but that was all I seen. I feel terrible for her. She really should go to the police.
693 2018-08-24 22:19:30 Nah just bread with oil and garlic

Some of the comments on #US Oil were invalid last night when my mind was preoccupied with certain ideas. There are no right, wrong, good or bad comments but only valid or invalid ones because they are projected beforehand not after the fact.
697 2018-08-24 22:18:33 Listen more than you speak be intelligent
698 2018-08-24 22:18:31 oil spils KNOCK IT OFF there’s penguins on earth that can’t even walk because they’re covered in oil that’s FUCKED UP

700 2018-08-24 22:18:11 Hitler killed millions of  jews out of envy  and Wilson Churchill and his  Nigeria Muslim gangs  killed millions of biafra children in civil war because of oil and gas.can u see now that u b4 u can count 1 to 3 genocide in world the Britain must be there. Why?
701 2018-08-24 22:18:06 For a continuous foothold of the Middle East's oil by any chance?
702 2018-08-24 22:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.

"This will solve all my problems"
704 2018-08-24 22:17:47 I’m on my second one and have never had a problem. The maintenance plan is amazing. Oil changes once a year! That alone is worth it. If I ever do have a problem I just take it to any BMW dealer and drop my keys off and they fix it and give me a loaner car.
705 2018-08-24 22:17:34 I literally hate myself for allowing my engine to blow....trying to buy another car is proving to be much more expensive than a fucking oil change
706 2018-08-24 22:17:33 I spilled an assload of olive oil on my favorite hoodie a few weeks ago and dawn dish soap got it all out
707 2018-08-24 22:17:13 Thank you Manny, your endorsement means a lot to me.
I’m happy you like the face oil.
708 2018-08-24 22:16:58 What a bunch of garbage this is. We don't need Russian oil and steel Pres. Trump fixed all that. We actually will export oil and probably steel with all the mills coming back on line

710 2018-08-24 22:16:45 easy solution to overpopulation: we plant boobytraps (quicksand, oil slicks, bear traps, etc) everywhere. the weak and the dumb will naturally be more susceptible to the boobytraps and this will also serve as an artificial selection process

benji 2032!!!
711 2018-08-24 22:16:44 We don't subsidize oil any more than any other extractive industry.
712 2018-08-24 22:16:41 Fuck me dead. Netanyahu comes straight out and says the truth of what the PALESTINE issue really....the enormous gas and oil reserves of Syria that Israel lusts for in its heart. The Golan heights l was NEVER Part of Isreal.
713 2018-08-24 22:16:31 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
714 2018-08-24 22:16:31 we might be better suited to be compared to the Clampetts and we just hit oil
715 2018-08-24 22:16:19 Why not? We still subsidize oil! Explain to me why my tax dollars still subsidize an industry that is set to make around 200 Billion in profit this year, but you have an issue with subsidizing clean energy... 
716 2018-08-24 22:16:19 The battle of the baby oil bodies.. Whew chile
717 2018-08-24 22:15:49 Spain and Italia are the leaders here.  Olive oil and sun 
718 2018-08-24 22:15:48 Where can I buy castor oil in warri
719 2018-08-24 22:15:43 Exactly! A white man just murdered his wife and kids and put them in an oil barrel in Colorado... where do we put him? In jail!
720 2018-08-24 22:15:33 Take it to lone star car wash 
Oil change and free car wash for like $85
721 2018-08-24 22:15:30 So what’s the other third made out of?? And it’s KRAFT which means it’ll be filled with GMO soybean oil and processed everything. 
722 2018-08-24 22:15:12 Yep, they’re all waiting offshore to do the same thing, moving the oil around until the price is right.  It should be illegal really, one day there’ll be an accident
723 2018-08-24 22:14:59 Naka ne oga?
724 2018-08-24 22:14:59 Yay! Finally a Day Off!! Of course, that means I need to do all of the #adulting stuff like deal with appointments, oil change, post office, etc. But still!!! Time with the hubby! Enjoy your weekend All!
725 2018-08-24 22:14:55 Kinda wanna be social but I need to change the oil in my car so probably just gonna do that tonight
726 2018-08-24 22:14:46 Reading these books by African authors I want to try palm wine and want to try to cook in palm oil...just curious now! Oh and groundnuts (book is set in Gold Coast 1800s)

730 2018-08-24 22:13:58 Well said but can you intelligently give credit to the owner of the post
731 2018-08-24 22:13:42 Hot.  Toaster oven... Or a little bit of olive oil in a pan and fry it.  Better than fresh that way.
732 2018-08-24 22:13:42 Haven’t heard a WORD out of Billy Graham regarding his boy Trumps troubles.  Maybe he realizes that he is a freakin snake oil racist pastor & his days of influence are over.  Ugh...I wish!!   #fraud #fatherwouldbeashamedofhim #racisthomophobicpastor

735 2018-08-24 22:12:54 .@cindymccain please try cannabis oil. It has cured terminal cancer with no side effects.
736 2018-08-24 22:12:35 The entire coconut fiasco was done intentionally to satiate cooking oil lobby. Coconut oil is now largely used by restaurant, and it has cause lot of wobble in the industry hence these erroneous facts.

740 2018-08-24 22:12:09 So you have one of the greatest “cheaters” of all time ( not to mention one nut) as your spokesman. Good call
741 2018-08-24 22:12:07 Come now. We have to leave them *some* Oil Wealth so they can afford to buy fresh water from us later this century.
742 2018-08-24 22:12:01 We haven't reached peak oil production, but we will probably soon approach peak oil demand. No need to subsidize to force the issue. If other forms of energy become cheaper (e.g., small nukes), we'll reduce our oil use, or switch more of it to other uses than energy production.
743 2018-08-24 22:11:36 Ok. Enough nice tweeting.

WTF is wrong with you?

You're pissed off because I said Trump just wants the oil?

What has he said about all military actions? He says "we should keep the oil".

Oil & tourism are some of the largest industries there. It would destroy any recovery.

746 2018-08-24 22:11:15 “Did ya know Obummer is a socialist?” 
No he isn’t do you know what the definition of socialism is? 
Pause then “yeah I know where socialist countries are”
That’s not what I asked anyway Sarah Palin got raises for every Alaskan in Oil Co. profits.

758 2018-08-24 22:10:20 Absolutely right. It's the unit of measure we have been arguing. Also that of the entire planet. By what measure? #1 gold reserve=Ft. Knox, #3 gold reserve 4 floor subterranean Bank of England, #1 Diamond reserve DeBerg London (via Africa) and Oil, and Uranium, and on & on. 
759 2018-08-24 22:10:15 Does this need a tart fruit element? Beef fat and chilli oil feels quite rich.
760 2018-08-24 22:10:11 But we have in the past, and if we continue our reliance on oil, we will likely go back again.

It was originally reported as an oil tanker fire, but that information has yet to be confirmed. The fire was reported just before 4 p.m.

767 2018-08-24 22:09:19 So I’m switching up my soap recipes, as of now I don’t use any palm oil however without palm oil, soaps dissolve way quicker. Would y’all rather:
768 2018-08-24 22:08:48 9:19pm 2 crews from @DWFRSPooleFire  went to Upper Golf Links Rd to a suspected gas leak which turned out to be a heating oil leak.
769 2018-08-24 22:08:44 Oh I know the tricks and can surgically excise the offending little clicks.  My system has become hot tea to keep my throat loose with a bit of coconut oil to keep everything slippery.  Works pretty well.  Also delicious.
770 2018-08-24 22:08:40 So, Midnight Oil got it wrong when they sang, "Few of the sins of the father, are visited upon the son"
771 2018-08-24 22:08:39 Great analysis. Besides these reasons, if refiners feed their refineries with too light slates, heavy products (as asphalt, lubricants and heavy fuel oil) yields are going to decrease leaving the market balance for these products in deficit.
772 2018-08-24 22:08:33 I’m so miserable lmao. I decided to get an oil change and transmission flush thinking the TSF was pretty quick and I’m late to meet my friend and I’m freakin hottttt in my car !

779 2018-08-24 22:07:06 You chop sotey palm oil stain ur shirt
780 2018-08-24 22:06:59 Wtffff. So true unfortunately. I always wait on my own at oil changes. And every single time they come to me with “this needs replaced or this needs done.” Last week glenn came with bc he was home and what do you know, in and out with nobody trying to sell me extra shit.
781 2018-08-24 22:06:59 I’d rather America, once again be the ground breaking country it is and hold all the patents. Instead of us going to Saudi for oil, I want them coming to us for solar.... or we can just keep coal.
782 2018-08-24 22:06:43 Fraser: No-one in the oil industry wants the job of refining our dirty oil.
& whadda ya know, Canada has no N.E.P. so there's no cohesion on how that might happen anyway, in an industry comprised of majority foreign owned companies, but thanx 4 the ill-thot 'suggestion'

785 2018-08-24 22:06:33 About science, Trump and most of the GOP don't believe in global warming, or that it's affected by humans. Oil and coal industries are going unchecked. Wildlife protections are being repealed. Doctors can refuse treatment based on their personal beliefs. NASA's defunded.

790 2018-08-24 22:06:00 #ukog sent another 2-3 tankers out the gate today Some of the comments from the shorters are cringeworthy. “How do we know it’s oil” “bkp don’t move oil”.

792 2018-08-24 22:05:46 Now, it is not only Saudi that is not developed enough to withstand the huge challenge of moving away from oil and the petrodollar. It is pretty much every single country in the world  is not developed enough in that matter.
793 2018-08-24 22:05:30 - Israel turns off all of Sinai to Egypt for peace (only oil Israel saw when their economy was in poor states)

- All of Gaza left by Israel for peace, got missiles back

- Offer nearly all gains after '67, and got the famous 3 no's back "no peace, no israel, no negotiation"
794 2018-08-24 22:05:10 No one ever prepared me for having to schedule an appointment for an oil change.. but one thing’s for sure.. Im glad I know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

796 2018-08-24 22:04:51 Yeah I saw/read that in German by Dr. Karin Michels of Harvard. You just don’t know who to believe anymore My daughter uses the oil on her hair anyway so no worries I only eat  when home in the Caribbean
797 2018-08-24 22:04:48 Its something snake oil salesmen are using to fool people.
798 2018-08-24 22:04:33 @sunriseon7 Coconut oil unhealthy?? please stop spreading yet another misinformation and do your research before quoting irresponsible and misinformed articles. Coconut oil is THE healthiest oil out there. Its unique monosaturated fat has many amazing properties.
799 2018-08-24 22:04:23 Guess who is gonna start making lotions & scrubs again? Imma order a Turkish Mocha, blueberry, & a dark chocolate fragrance oil.
800 2018-08-24 22:04:14  similar happened to me. Just had to throw everything away in the end. That oil won’t quit
801 2018-08-24 22:04:12 Yesterday's run in with a noxious oil diffuser at the dentist has destroyed the voices of two out of three of us who went. Please do not diffuse essential oils in public spaces, ever. We are not even allergic. This shit could kill someone who IS allergic or asthmatic.

813 2018-08-24 22:02:13 If I ask for analysis now, all I'll hear is "Buhari this"...."Buhari that". No mention of low oil prices in an oil dependant economy that produces minimal products and has refused to diversify. Any excuse to scream "Buhari" robs the brain of the ability to think deep.

821 2018-08-24 22:01:07 Bc that's acrylic paint. In order to blend the sky, she would have to thin it out to get a "wash like" blend. If not it would have been not blended and chunky. Plus Acrylic paint isnt that thick to begin with, the thick paint is oil paint which is waaayyyy more expensive
822 2018-08-24 22:01:06 At times these so called American scholars  think they know too much.  Probably he must have been talking about the coconut oil produced within the US.
823 2018-08-24 22:01:04 I had lavender oil in my baths for my second degree tear. I don’t miss that pain, but I do miss two 15 minute me time baths every day. The lavender oil was really lovely, if you fancied a change, and it’ll help too.
824 2018-08-24 22:00:55 Bcos at that time there was what we call ' shock absorber" of around $64bn foreign reserve.  But in 2015 when oil started to fall down, the reserve was deplated to about $28bn only.
825 2018-08-24 22:00:33 Pretty much, it’s funny seeing the Vox article say “whether or not it’s actually true is irrelevant” because appearently, only racists care about white people.

828 2018-08-24 22:00:08 Economy is always unstable/unreliable, right. Gold has been stable/reliable. Can anyone trade oil for gold? It is always traded for unstable/unreliable petrodollar & the economy that is associated with it. To move from ‘oil addiction’, there has to be a move from the petrodollar.
829 2018-08-24 22:00:04 You should buy a Chilton Guide for your car so you can look up things with your car and know what you can do and what you can't. Also, if you feel you can, YouTube will probably have videos to teach you about it. 

Like, oil changes? You can totally do that.

834 2018-08-24 21:59:22 If we can buy them plane tickets would they be willing to protest in other areas of the world that produce 100x the amount of oil and have horrible  track records of pollution/wages/crimes against humanity? Or it’s just  oil?
835 2018-08-24 21:59:10 Remember when gas was at an all time high and oil companies were making record profit and the government did nothing?
836 2018-08-24 21:59:07 Your President is an unindicted co-conspirator.
837 2018-08-24 21:59:03 my whole ass bottle of tea tree oil got dumped on the carpet :)

842 2018-08-24 21:58:41 Oh sand I just read a report on coconut oil. It’s poison to our bodies.
843 2018-08-24 21:58:39 Nigeriw is today d poverty capital of the world as a results of mass looting, lack of political will to save for a rainy day by d previous administrations when oil which was d only means of money was above $100 a barrel.

848 2018-08-24 21:58:27 Its been proven that chemotherapy is a very absurd method in treating cancer. But your mainstream doctor won't tell you that. I think he intends trying an alternative route, but I might be wrong. Cannabis oil is a very good medication for cancer also.

850 2018-08-24 21:58:12 I always feel so responsible after getting an oil change 
851 2018-08-24 21:58:11 Baby is killing me right now & I'm "patiently" waiting on my oil change.. for almost 2 hours now.
852 2018-08-24 21:58:03 We're going to need to double the size of the North Sea oil fields to power the gaslighting from useful fools on Twitter tonight.
853 2018-08-24 21:57:50 Apart from @Atomicrod's excellent "smoking gun" reporting I don't know anything concrete. Just my impressions from talking to the people I met in the oil industry via my father and brother connections.
854 2018-08-24 21:57:34 It’s an old film James Cagney, Virginia Mayo he’s a gangster. At the end when he’s caught he climbs up some oil storage tanks that’s what he shouts as he’s shot and burned up.
855 2018-08-24 21:57:26 It was a whole group project thing for us. Each group got assigned something like oil change or whatever and had to make an informational video about it

858 2018-08-24 21:57:01 Left will play along. Generating any sympathy for white ppl in general is opposite of the white privilege/ BDS narrative they are pushing.
859 2018-08-24 21:56:20 Oil change easy tho youtube that shit save some money
860 2018-08-24 21:56:19 That's a laugh! you mean protect the oil and uranium that might be there.
861 2018-08-24 21:56:08 And then you leave that comment at the end you obsessed headcase. Go back to supporting Chelsea or Blackburn or Newcastle or who ever it was before the oil money..

864 2018-08-24 21:55:37 Sorry--the general tenor of comments has been very anti-essential oil, so we wanted to provide a counterpoint #holistichealth
865 2018-08-24 21:55:29 I don’t buy that derivatives kill the benefits of scarcity. There are derivatives on tons of things that have finite supply (shares, gold, oil, etc.)

869 2018-08-24 21:54:33 Oil? All I see is sparkle sis 
870 2018-08-24 21:54:31 Funny you should mention oil. We're starting a budget plan soon with our local company. Spread the cost over the year. And we'll never run out!
871 2018-08-24 21:54:26 Dont forget all the oil and water are US national security assets and martians can fuck themselves or move out if they dont like it.
872 2018-08-24 21:54:25 Sooooo who gonna massage my scalp with eucalyptus, tea tree & peppermint oil once I finish shampooing my hair??
873 2018-08-24 21:54:20 We do coconut oil a dab on the paw at bedtime
874 2018-08-24 21:54:05 No, they are exporting animal products and oil. Please stop with the strawman arguments. My argument is that they can bring in ships with food rather than just empty ships to carry out more products. In fact, any just government would require this.
875 2018-08-24 21:53:55 Made an oil change appointment... sat here for an hour before my whip even went into the bay. Sheesh.
876 2018-08-24 21:53:49 guess who had hot oil splash onto his face!!!!!!!!!! lol!!!!!!!
877 2018-08-24 21:53:42  time to start a hashtag

879 2018-08-24 21:53:32 @FuriousFirmino you, and elites like you should murder any rumours that put LFC with oil money.

883 2018-08-24 21:53:13 OK thanks for that correction: "owners of fossil resources". Are you thinking mostly of private landowners here, or of national governments of oil- and gas-exporting nations?

885 2018-08-24 21:53:04 RITTOさんとかOLIVE OILとかきとった！
886 2018-08-24 21:53:04 My father worked for Shell as a petroleum engineer most of his working life, and my brother works for an oil company too. They've told me they've always been aware that nuclear is the best energy source. They actually got taught this at Uni. Thet also know the benefits of fossil.
887 2018-08-24 21:52:47 I wonder if farmers call up the auto parts store and ask which type of oil they purchased like they do during harvest for the variety of wheat they planted.
888 2018-08-24 21:52:39 Looking at other countries where people of this particular ideology have taken positions in office, it is plain to see the impact has been anything but positive. Oil & water ! All it’ll make is a mess !
889 2018-08-24 21:52:29 @Schwarzenegger Arnold get sen.McCain say hey listen Joe puts some good stuff in front I want you to inhale it...CBD oil. It's better for you think!
890 2018-08-24 21:52:15 my research says wasps hate peppermint or spearmint! mix a bit of mint oil with water and you can spray or spread that around your entrance points
891 2018-08-24 21:52:13 No, not just oil. The USA is a powerhouse and has got there partly due to its foreign policy even though it has been at the expense of other nations. Leaving the playground to Russia is a mistake. Losing influence ultimately means losing power.
892 2018-08-24 21:52:09 My skin has been actin up since I let that man smear motor oil all over my face. One and done.

895 2018-08-24 21:51:57 I don't care if you're from Harvard if you call coconut oil pure poison you ought to be drowned in it :)
896 2018-08-24 21:51:51 You know full well the Gers figures were devised by Tories to prevent the true financial situation being revealed The oil revenue is not included and in fact Labour never wanted us to know about that by suppressing the McCrone report Miles better without you!
897 2018-08-24 21:51:48 It's clear we are still asleep.
To think that the government spent billions in a futile search for oil in lake Chad shows we are still sound asleep.
898 2018-08-24 21:51:28 Hmmm...cyanide  coconut oil....cyanide  coconut oil... it’s a tough one 

I bet this ‘research’ is funded by someone who has a vested interest in selling some manufactured alternative.
899 2018-08-24 21:51:24 Home from work get me that shower razor and baby oil
900 2018-08-24 21:51:22 simple..your light does not work and you parked over someones oil spill
901 2018-08-24 21:51:10 yeah but they are not making any more oil. it is a finite resource
902 2018-08-24 21:51:00 just got done with the oil change that’s right doing big girl things
903 2018-08-24 21:50:58 U bought beard oil? What for, bro... It's like me buying a bra for myself
904 2018-08-24 21:50:55 Okay toh

906 2018-08-24 21:50:47 @thidakarn สวัสดีค่ะ อยากทราบว่า CBD cream/oil หากทาไปแล้วผิวหนังจะ absorb ประมาณกี่วันคะ? คือไปสมัครงานแล้วมี drug test เลยกังวล ขอบคุณค่ะ 
907 2018-08-24 21:50:41 At 833,630 metric tons, the June crude oil imports were 48.8 percent lower than the amount imported in May, as local state energy company Pertamina focused its efforts on growing domestic production amid a falling rupiah that made imports costlier, S&P Global Platts notes
908 2018-08-24 21:50:38 Yes and no.
It's the owners of fossil resources that have supported antinuclearism, but oil companies have not generally done this. On the contrary: some have tried to get into nuclear themselves. Blaming fossil industry for climate and antinuclearism is too easy, and wrong, imo.
909 2018-08-24 21:50:37 Which part? it's a salad with Parmesan crisps, some olive oil vignette, three cheese blend very few bacon bits and a jalapeno. then pork chops with crushed pork rinds(that were seasoned)
910 2018-08-24 21:50:21 more than just the last 6 years, its something like 19 out of the last 20 years. oil was the only thing that made big differences here and clearly that is on its last legs, there wont be any large revenues coming from oil that will fill the shortfalls
911 2018-08-24 21:50:00 @SenJohnMcCain you need to get on 1:1 cannabis oil
912 2018-08-24 21:49:47 Oil is about $80 dollars now.
You do realize brexit is happening?
913 2018-08-24 21:49:45 Have you ever tried peppermint oil for a headache? Or eucalyptus oil to clear congestion? There are a number of effective, non-medical remedies. I wouldn't rely on acupuncture to cure cancer, but it can certainly help someone tolerate chemotherapy.
914 2018-08-24 21:49:18 First time I used something with coconut oil (shampoo) I had a bad allergic reaction. We tend to over-embrace new things, only to find out later they weren't anything to celebrate.
915 2018-08-24 21:49:18 This is actually a really, really good idea. It would be great to start a wellness/health expo with participants (including "spiritual" advisors, etc) who are focused on the same goals as Goop, but refuse to promise miracles or sell overpriced snake oil.

919 2018-08-24 21:48:59 Don’t worry the oil will hit the ice for game one soon. That will be comical enough
920 2018-08-24 21:48:57 Crude oil production at Alwyn, Elgin, and Dunbar pumps up to 50,000 bpd to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams—the key components of the Dated Brent benchmark

this is my ideal friday night
922 2018-08-24 21:48:43 It was yummy as... and to think a few years ago I was indulging in whatever edibles I came across... didn’t I get my wake up call!! To think that  Havard Uni, Prof Karin Michels stated that coconut oil is poison!!
923 2018-08-24 21:48:24 I've killed many beetles. Some I accidentally squashed. One I drove until it was out of oil. But I've never killed a Beatle :)
924 2018-08-24 21:48:12 Since July, workers at three oil and gas platforms operated by Total in the North Sea—Alwyn, Elgin, and Dunbar—have held five strikes in a dispute that arose after Total wanted to place workers at the platforms on a three-week rotation system instead of a two-week one.

926 2018-08-24 21:48:05 If there are no jobs be innovative.....a lady on Twitter started selling anwamoo (oil rice with pepper) and everyone is so happy and retweeting to help am sure she has started hiring others but now
927 2018-08-24 21:48:05 Sure no problem
Want.
1. Return of all sovereignty
2. Complete control on immigration
3. Freedom to trade across the world
4. Stop all payments to EU including divorce bill
Compromise.
1. Truffle oil out of stock
2, Accept there to be an economic cost for short period of time,
928 2018-08-24 21:47:43 the amount of oil that accumulates on my face could fry chicken
929 2018-08-24 21:47:42 Pepperoni isn't real meat in any case. I think it's made of cardboard soaked in seasoned oil.

931 2018-08-24 21:47:28 is almond oil an essential oil
932 2018-08-24 21:47:25 I’ve been told that coconut oil is a healthier substitute for olive oil. Is that true?
933 2018-08-24 21:47:21 Put locust beans first and fry it with ororo and red oil so the jollof can have red color
934 2018-08-24 21:47:03 Gta change my oil and finish my yard when i get to the crib. # WhatIsRest
935 2018-08-24 21:47:03 How do you need to drive 100 miles for a brake light? Or is that for the oil? Either way sounds like too much.
936 2018-08-24 21:47:00 maybe it's that midway feeling where it seems like things are half-finished, you end up scrutinising little things separately instead of seeing the creation as a whole. maybe you need a little oil to get the joints going again, but you can do it! everything will come together :)
937 2018-08-24 21:46:59 Actually, if it were me, I'd like to know my edibles/oil came from a good source. In the US, the illegal growers are hurting the environment in the forests.
938 2018-08-24 21:46:59 Scomo is even worse at selling given he's appalling record at Tourism Australia. So sure same toxic policies new snake oil salesman. That'd work.

944 2018-08-24 21:46:15 Coconut water is good, coconut cream is good, how can coconut oil be poison unless someone mix it with poison
945 2018-08-24 21:46:14 Ba yar Kt ba ce
946 2018-08-24 21:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet residing in our country with dignity.
947 2018-08-24 21:45:46 Swear coconut oil will have you’re skin glooowinggg.
948 2018-08-24 21:45:34 Should have specified, wrap in foil with olive oil, salt, and pepper and serve with parmesan. You gals have good taste.

950 2018-08-24 21:45:26 The jab jab oil will stay in your life longer than the jab himself.
951 2018-08-24 21:45:11 tho’; it means nothing until we are actually independent when precedent will decide on the split anyway which means 90% of the oil is indeed in what will unquestionably be in the Scottish sector.
952 2018-08-24 21:45:01 sorry bro, why debts, upon all the excess crude oil fund, with the eldorado praises we were showing on Sen.  Godswill for the uncommon transformation using the inter ministerial direct labour, da unie eyen ewot nnah, don't mind me bro, im just surprise...
953 2018-08-24 21:44:53 I think it will be another 15-20 years before things collapse around him.  His main backer, Iran, is having severe economic struggles of its own.  In addition, Syria's tiny oil reserves will eventually dwindle. Numbers show he won't live forever
954 2018-08-24 21:44:44 Easy. Easy peasy. It's a numbers game. If SA, or anywhere else, takes the hit on CO2 emisions from extraction, that doesn't affect Canada's numbers. Canada has all the oil it ever needs but the gov HATES oil. Even though every Canuk would be DEAD within 2 months without it.
955 2018-08-24 21:44:35 Thanks!  I was just on an "oil field road" in Weld County yesterday, and the amount of trucks I thought was surprising...nothing like this though.
956 2018-08-24 21:44:23 
957 2018-08-24 21:44:17 I’ve been enthusiastically consuming coconut (in moderation!) since I was a kid, but I only use the oil as a moisturizer.
958 2018-08-24 21:44:12 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
959 2018-08-24 21:43:30 Hyperbole in action. Saturated fat from your diet is not ideal especially if you have heart disease risk factors. But calling an edible food like coconut oil poison is too much.
960 2018-08-24 21:43:23 My father has been using the CBD oil. Says he feels less pain and doesn't feel as foggy as he did on his pain meds.
961 2018-08-24 21:43:21 If anyone knows someone who is highly self motivated and wants to apply to be an operator in oil and gas field near houston let me know. Rare opportunity fr fr

963 2018-08-24 21:43:16 90min hot oil massage at 430. I love spoiling myself 
964 2018-08-24 21:43:10 After a while (I think it was 1-3 months) your body figures out that it doesn't have to pump out quite much oil (since the shampoo isn't stripping your scalp of it as frequently) so you dont get that greased rat look after 1 day of not washing your hair.
965 2018-08-24 21:43:06 How many of them know 1 sentence from one opinion he has written?
966 2018-08-24 21:42:53 My brother got caught with oil cartridges in his room and my pops looked me dead in my eye and asked if he was smoking PCP
967 2018-08-24 21:42:49 Şu body lotion body oil falan çok iyi değil mi ya. Canın mı sıkkın iki fıs sıkıyorsun anında modun değişiyor. Saç spreyleri de aynı işi görüyor. Kadın olmak bi harika dostum. 
968 2018-08-24 21:42:47 Probably true!! But how much does coconut oil cost or whatever alternative they prescribe
969 2018-08-24 21:42:43 loving your humour cheers @Heid_oil keep em coming #badgeofhonour #ukog  valdez xx
970 2018-08-24 21:42:32 I did think it was extremely weird when holistic health white people were putting coconut oil in ALL of their food

973 2018-08-24 21:41:44 All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these items while screening your property.

975 2018-08-24 21:40:46 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
976 2018-08-24 21:40:46 In Oakland I lived in a poor area. The lack of tax base meant lack of services and their trash collection and cleanup was bad, and the hoods where it was worse would have to dump their trash in the handful of places where they collected. Folks left cut open milk jugs of oil.
977 2018-08-24 21:40:46 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

981 2018-08-24 21:40:05 It's confusing. Blue Emu is actually made of emu oil, but Tiger Balm doesn't contain any tiger byproducts
982 2018-08-24 21:40:05 It’s everything that you listed as well as being a State that has been under attack, economically and politically (covertly & overtly), by the US for over 2 decades due to oil.
983 2018-08-24 21:39:55 one is CAUSE OF MAN the other is nature. we dont even NEED oil the process of pyrolysis, biomass material can be burned in a reactor to produce fuel oil. This method will produce 80gallon of renewable gasoline fuel for every dry ton of biomass

985 2018-08-24 21:39:45 My microbiology professor just said “A lot of people believe that oil is just dead dinosaurs” 
Um... yeah... fuck this, I’m dropping

988 2018-08-24 21:39:09 Hold on there citizen! Street sweepers (called mechanical brooms) brush dirt and oil  away into their collection bins and off your street!
989 2018-08-24 21:39:02 I did not see Palm oil
990 2018-08-24 21:39:00 ... with the help of billionaire oil rich guys the Panthers don't have.
991 2018-08-24 21:38:54 Most of these energy workers are going to be employed regardless of the source of energy anyway & whether solar, hydro, gas or coal, the delivery grid will be unchanged. Also, biofuels would employ as many workers as oil, longer, because oil WILL run out.
992 2018-08-24 21:38:45 Ameen oga sir
993 2018-08-24 21:38:25 Moore was showing the complex relationships between the Bush’s, the Saudis, and Big Oil and he was “insinuating” that the Bush’s response to 9/11 was influenced by those relationships. That’s a far cry from saying the Bush’s were “behind” 9/11.
994 2018-08-24 21:38:23 Lmaoooo bro just use beard oil
995 2018-08-24 21:38:22 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
996 2018-08-24 21:38:21 Person: “why are you so dirty?”

Me: “i like to roll around in the oil” 

Person: “oh really?”

Me: “no bitch, i work something you should be doing”.
997 2018-08-24 21:38:21 As icky as it may sound you could try washing your hair less often.  

Dandruff is typically over drying caused by shampoos removing too much oil from your scalp.

If you do try this just a warning at first your hair may look really oily like next day.  A dry shampoo will help
998 2018-08-24 21:38:17 Use saeed ghani's mughziat hair oil and shampoo it really works
999 2018-08-24 21:38:06 Make a pizza! Use a base of olive oil and provolone, add sliced squash and bake. Top with chopped chives.
1000 2018-08-24 21:38:05 Let's face it, you've been burning the midnight oil and painting it too!
1001 2018-08-24 21:37:53 Part stores need to have a self serve lane. I know it’s petty, but I don’t want to wait 15+ min to buy an oil filter
1002 2018-08-24 21:37:51 Big mouth! We should be glad the Americans still take our oil for any price. the previous Canadian governments liberal or conservative federal or provincial floundered so many chances to diversify our oil and gas markets, and you think you can do it now? I can't see it and sorry.

1005 2018-08-24 21:36:49 So the Lucas Oil Stadium is going to have new foods on the menu. Everything most likely will be $10-$20. Well, this means full meals before football games.
1006 2018-08-24 21:36:45 Well you shouldn't exfoliate more than once or twice a week. Being overly aggressive can cause micro cuts to the skin causing more oil production and more breakouts.
1007 2018-08-24 21:36:44 Vet said to give the birds coconut oil for their dry skin and they tried some and were NOT IMPRESSED. Thankfully I'm good at cooking cuz I'll have to bake it into something they'll actually eat lol....
1008 2018-08-24 21:36:24 I lost a lot of weight eating raw coconut oil daily
1009 2018-08-24 21:36:23 Me & dess putting oil in the car with our longass nails  were is a boyfriend when you need one !
1010 2018-08-24 21:36:12 We, the happy few, are also producing for example rapeseed oil to feed our hunger for fuel, instead of producing food for those who need to feed their hunger...
1011 2018-08-24 21:36:09 An uplifting facial mask, soft white, with coconut oil, jojoba oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. It's sold as a clay wrapped in paper.
1012 2018-08-24 21:36:08 People actually do put sugar in beans? As in for real? Like cook beans put pepper crayfish Maggi red oil ginger and garlic etc inside & now add cubes of sugar inside again?
1013 2018-08-24 21:36:06 bottle of that cappuccino sangria, two shots of henny and like 6 cups of oil. GONE.
1014 2018-08-24 21:35:50 Is this...portrait mode!?
1015 2018-08-24 21:35:23 Pure BS. Coal can be used responsibly & for other uses, besides burning. Oil will be depleted in far less than a generation & standing in the way of alternatives is not just selfish, its truly a national security risk. Regardless, how many jobs have you kept that can be automated
1016 2018-08-24 21:34:46 Confidence is wearing the shorts with the oil stain, because they’re just that comfortable.

1028 2018-08-24 21:32:54 Woman get a car and don’t check anything. Oil, tire pressure , coolant etc. They just wake up and drive that mf
1029 2018-08-24 21:32:43 Your questions should be put to Jonathan Goodluck who ran Nigeria when oil was gold; made tons of money that should have helped build our nation; but who unfortunately misappropriated nearly the entire income. Whilst this brigandage happened, the whole of East Nigeria was silent.
1030 2018-08-24 21:32:37 lmao are you kidding me? have you never put chips on a paper towel and the paper towel had oil spots from the chips? 

chips are moist and crunchy!!
1031 2018-08-24 21:32:14 Having thick lips is a pain in the ass can you guys stop cracking all the time? It’s a huge budget on coconut oil
1032 2018-08-24 21:32:10 I’d rather we have a bunch of nuclear plants, electrify everything, and then watch the autocratic oil regimes go down (not to mention Exxon and the like). But that’s just me and a bunch of ecomodernist leftists.
1033 2018-08-24 21:32:08 OH no put yogurt or coconut oil they're good for burns!!

1041 2018-08-24 21:31:23 I didn't say you stated otherwise. You know my first tweet was a response to @BluestateGranny, right...?
The Democratic Party's hostility toward progressives and its embrace of big-money donors -- including oil money -- will be its demise.
1042 2018-08-24 21:31:19 I've used CBD oil to tread back pain (never used it in any other manner). My experience has led me to believe that it's a rather incredible little plant. But yes, it's unfortunate that the idiot potheads give it a bad reputation.
1043 2018-08-24 21:31:18 Oil road [and I didn't catch the other one his voice was muffled] are closed due to numerous downed power lines.   It's so dangerous they aren't even allowing fire fighters to enter.

1047 2018-08-24 21:30:39 We depend on oil not only for transportation but a whole lot of other products made from oil.
1048 2018-08-24 21:30:36 Prof in my last tweet showed up in jeans, flip flops and was eating a slice of pizza. He shit on people from nova for like 20 minutes and told us how he and his brother wanted to dress up in hazmat suits and pour colored water out of an oil drum outside the VCU chem building.

1060 2018-08-24 21:29:47 Hemp oil updated week 4? 5? I haven't had a single attack the entire time- had been averaging 2/3 moderate to severe ones a week. Surreal. Team hemp!
1061 2018-08-24 21:29:37 You seem to think everything will go on as normal otherwise. Brexit is hitting the fan. Never mind the oil, stockpile the medicines and food.

just dont get it in ya eye lol
1073 2018-08-24 21:27:36 Now this is three times. Measured by what metric? Fluid dollars are one thing. Maybe pretty close. Resources, reserves & assets are quite another. Which is why I say we are comparing apples to oranges. Your own comparison to Venez. Bolivars (worthless junk) but HUGE oil reserves.
1074 2018-08-24 21:27:23 I'm hoping mine is a hormonal skin thing today, it's like my skin is too dry but also oil from my skin is breaking up the foundation? So I've got a dissolving foundation caking on my face
1075 2018-08-24 21:26:55 On that note my mother used to give me drops of oil of oregano in orange juice. Long as it didn't hit anything you'd be okay? Apparently that stuff is so burn-y you're not supposed to take it internally. 

But I'm all for this "take something painful that'll kill EVERYTHING" camp
1076 2018-08-24 21:26:53 Chinese and Russian ships seen supplying oil to North Korea.

1077 2018-08-24 21:26:37 It's not a pure market, but the choice between pursuing energy east vs pursuing KXL was made for market reasons - KXL is shorter, cheaper, and serves a higher value market where many oil sands cos have assets. EE serves a market controlled by one family.

1083 2018-08-24 21:26:00 Chevron?  Oh I bet this will be a really impartial article.
They wouldn't just be trying to get their grubby mitts on more of that Ecuadorian oil now, would they?
1084 2018-08-24 21:25:56 I think it's a personality clash. I love both of them, but they are SO VERY DIFFERENT! oil & water!

1089 2018-08-24 21:25:17 It is minced pork doused with chili oil. Normally it is very hot. Think they toned it down for whitey. Yes, glad to be headed home and for my experiences
1090 2018-08-24 21:25:15 ok wait wait. i just got hydro boost and it says oil free in the back? i thought that was good to use??
1091 2018-08-24 21:24:55 Guy, Quit talking trash. Millions of grandmothers across the South South will NEVER drink again from ancestral springs they were born & grew to love above all others bc of crude oil exploitation by the Nigerian State. It does not make Urhobo, Itsekiri, the SS tribes are defeated.
1092 2018-08-24 21:24:53 and oil keeps the sub moist I’ve heard lol

1095 2018-08-24 21:24:13 I'm sha tired of rolling my eyes
1096 2018-08-24 21:23:28 I know sum niggas that don’t know how to do that or change their oil 
1097 2018-08-24 21:23:27 CO2 tax will NOT reduce GHG's, not at all. CO2 tax WILL act as a defacto export tax on our most critical resource export, oil, of which 3 million barrels/day flows to the USA. Only a Canadian, progressive  would think otherwise.  No wonder McKenna reduced it, even she knows that.
1098 2018-08-24 21:23:18 Read the first word of all her tweets
1099 2018-08-24 21:23:07 But, is an open truth. Despite the billion of dollars gotten from the sales of crude oil, Jonathan could not save, instead squandered the funds saved by his predecessors. Tell me 2 projects completed by Jonathan? #PinocchioOsinbajo

1103 2018-08-24 21:22:38 So you think a country full of natural resources, including oil, renewables amazing food and drink exports world wide is a basket case. All of this run (some might say mismanaged) by WM for 300+ yrs. Why are they so awfully keen to hold on to us?
Go on, tell us all.
1104 2018-08-24 21:22:31 Yo I’m from ft Lauderdale and I’m in ATL, I’m having a difficult time finding trees or oil round here

1108 2018-08-24 21:21:29 Finally a Monday-Friday job. First time in the oil & gas industry, but I’m very excited. 
1109 2018-08-24 21:21:27 Would be nice if the city actually cleaned up the dead pitbull on I70 in front of Lucas oil.  Really bad look for us @FOX59
1110 2018-08-24 21:21:11 I likened them to a tree in danger of falling over on the forest as they neglected the roots & tended the foliage.
They have since gone even more top heavy cutting away most the trunk as well.

1117 2018-08-24 21:20:18 How about the white man who killed his pregnant wife and two little daughters, then dumped them in oil bins to cover up the evidence? Is that different bc he lives here legally?
1118 2018-08-24 21:20:13 All palm oil free tho
1119 2018-08-24 21:20:07 Great stuff! Rose oil can do amazing things. I have an article that gives you all the details.
1120 2018-08-24 21:19:42 Bruh family & business like oil & water, shit don’t mix 
1121 2018-08-24 21:19:38 the loss of this bid is the fact that a great local bix focused area like rhos is being sucked into the normality of the general bid area rather than concentrating on the places USP and developing them via the levy cash.
1122 2018-08-24 21:19:34 And the @GOP is the only political party in the world to hold these views. Even Big Oil accepts reality

1126 2018-08-24 21:18:52 The Mazda, RX8 in particular was very prone to flooding on start up, would use horrendous amounts of oil when the rotor rips wore and would eventually lose compression. That’s why a used RX8 is so cheap.
1127 2018-08-24 21:18:46 it's from a failed oil rig company called Ken's Drilling (I know it failed bc the jacket owner name on the arm is Ken)
1128 2018-08-24 21:18:44 As an anarchist who isn’t particularly proud of time “serving” on a sub, some of the most awkward conversations I have are when I reference my time in the navy & am told that makes me a “Real Man” & am thanked for their freedom. Like, dude, I fought for your oil, get over it
1129 2018-08-24 21:18:40 @PXDtweets Again, Vincent advertising against a pro oil/gas politician. Think he voted for pro oil Trump or anti oil Hillary?
1130 2018-08-24 21:18:37 It makes sense that the skin could try and compensate for the oil thats being kept away from it. Only one way to find out---oh god my cistic just burst
1131 2018-08-24 21:18:37 Pwani Oil .....
1132 2018-08-24 21:18:29 England has run a negative trade balance continuously for near 3 decades. It desperately needs Scottish oil/whisky/food exports to mitigate its own structural failings & to prop up a fragile Pound Sterling.
1133 2018-08-24 21:18:22 Sounds like they had trouble using watercolor or one of those "only oil paints count" type of people. Get... I'm glad you continued! I love your watercolors :)

1135 2018-08-24 21:18:13 The oil has a very subtle taste. And helps keep everything moist.
1136 2018-08-24 21:18:07 Fundamentally our basic building blocks are Hydrocarbons, which end up in the ground from decaying animals, and over time become crude oil. Fossils themselves don’t become oil.
1137 2018-08-24 21:18:00 You're making an absurd assumption that the land is going to be intentionally destroyed by the oil industry.
In fact, the article specified that all the ecosystem would be protected, as well as the refineries, homes, towns. 
There is an enormous economic interest in this.

1139 2018-08-24 21:17:48 @ColwynBID  Can we learn anything from other BIDs? Is it working for you? Is it too complicated? More importantly, Is it working for US? and after all... We are paying it! Results need charts, charts need figures, and Figures... #gofigure! #wejustneedtoknow
1140 2018-08-24 21:17:41 imagine... new biz given loan via 3 person board, they pay money back they get support, the area benefits, more new biz attracted, the bid get more money and the pot gorws

1145 2018-08-24 21:17:19 A lot of #business groups & organisations have lost touch with the #Grassroots of their respective organisations.

1146 2018-08-24 21:17:08 I feed a three-legged stray black cat : you'd think he would eat anything, but he's more finicky than my 4 other cats all together. He only eats when a new can is *just* opened with a fine drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

1148 2018-08-24 21:16:43 LOL The fossilization process is when organic material is replaced with sediment, preserving the shape. The organic material that got replaced is what then becomes oil. The process of fossilization yields oil, basically.

1165 2018-08-24 21:14:54 Sometimes in academia it's called plagiarism, in business it could be seen as duplication and in the public sector it's seen as best practice
1166 2018-08-24 21:14:34 First coconut oil, now this! Life is just not worth living. #Wearyacademics.
1167 2018-08-24 21:14:25 I've microwaved coconut oil to use for oil shows before! Since it kinda needs to be heated to be liquid  it feels soooooo good when it's warm

1173 2018-08-24 21:14:02 Because they only measure the "overfeeding" not of the whole diet? would it be the same for a ketogenic diet? And an athlete keto ?? ...
And if it was not hypercaloric ?? Giving as dangerous the coconut oil or butter with this data is risky .it is not for everyone
1174 2018-08-24 21:13:58 Well dirty oil or dirty coal .. use it for progress. Use it only within 30 yrs .

1176 2018-08-24 21:13:31 That;'s because most Bids follow what other bids have or are doing rather than tailoring the objectives back to the true needs of the bid area.
1177 2018-08-24 21:13:13 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.

1183 2018-08-24 21:12:35 @olivado_oils Where can I get the nutrition info and essential fatty acid breakdown of your Natural Omega Plus Organic Oil? There are some general ratio descriptions but no hard numbers anywhere, and nothing comes up for the nutrition info tab of the product listing on your site.
1184 2018-08-24 21:12:32 Correct me if im wrong, cuz i use oil free products. Top with moisturiser+spf seems to be ok then top up moisturiser during the day. This seemed to help loads but should i use normal-skin products instead?@Proactiv is the one brand reigeim that acc worked

1186 2018-08-24 21:12:21 The oil god cares not from where the oil flows, only that it does. That is a resounding yes.
1187 2018-08-24 21:12:14 You do realize that's how it works?
Some rich white guy gets a monopoly on coconut oil and he starts paying ppl to spread bullshit about how good it is.
Same goes for alcohol.
If ppl stop drinking alcohol, some rich white dude is about to lose his billions.
That's capitalism

1191 2018-08-24 21:11:17 I had a dream it was Kushner that cut the deal with Rex Tillerson and Putin and Trumpsky for the Oil. Of course Rex lost interest in the job when the Oil went out the window
1192 2018-08-24 21:11:16 How much latitude was given for Russian money? You know you live Russian money. Look deep enough and you will find the real Russian money is behind every Trump deal. @trumpians are so naive and trusting of a snake oil salesman. @peopleofus @davidfrum @ddale8

build, #innovate improve & support 
is spot on for what should happen & would deliver growth & impact for stakeholders & wider area economy & growth but often these 4 key points are lost & delivery of a couple of flower tubs is what the #BiD delivers

1210 2018-08-24 21:09:13 (2) ...and this is the route I'm afraid our Senators in #Alaska will take.  How do you think they got Trump to open up  ANWAR for the Oil companies?  They voted for the GOP Tax Bill...knowing fully that this was going to harm low & middle income people.
1211 2018-08-24 21:09:07 How much longer will I be waiting for an oil change and tire rotation. Been here for 2 hours already

1216 2018-08-24 21:08:40 #UKOG #HORSEHILL But remember the Portland alone could well be a game changer on its own with new perforations and a much larger pump than even the last one Now extracting oil.

1219 2018-08-24 21:08:29 my new idea: frying food in cannabis oil

1226 2018-08-24 21:07:43 No, they don’t have oil in them. The reason that they damage your skin in the long term is because they harshly strip your skin of “good” & “bad” oils and you have to rehydrate your skin over time. The right amount of oil is good for your skin- even if you’re oily!!!
1227 2018-08-24 21:07:26 OK then, for the Blackpool audience, 1am @talkRADIO #swingersfilmclub, Lorenzo’s Massage Oil, Dogging Day Afternoon, The Third Man, that kind of thing, broadcastable if possible!
1228 2018-08-24 21:07:12 Oh it was fine  Just a few too many times realizing it’s better to wear a shirt than wait for a little drop of oil to catapult into the air. Onto skin.
1229 2018-08-24 21:07:06 This morning while I was sleeping Alex changed my oil, filled up my gas tank, and ordered a part that my car needs

1233 2018-08-24 21:06:41 Thinking about the time I wanted to make a tie-dye shirt after watching an episode of Zoom and my DAMN FIVE YEAR OLD DUMBASS SELF used canola oil because it was yellow. 
I dunked a whole white T-shirt in a bowl of canola oil.
1234 2018-08-24 21:06:10 it’s on a canvas panel so it should slip into a standard sized frame pretty well! i’m so excited, mostly because you’re gonna be the first and only person so far to have one of my oil paintings.

1236 2018-08-24 21:06:01 I never changed the oil on it when it was mine
1237 2018-08-24 21:05:57 I've sworn off oil. My skin hates it.
1238 2018-08-24 21:05:46 ...or coconut oil.

1240 2018-08-24 21:05:36 falls into the levy area and I think is presented to a 3 person panel letting them decide based on the 'idea' merits, then they report to the wider levy committee on a quarterly basis. If ideas work, more levy payments, better growth etc 2/2

1243 2018-08-24 21:05:12 Pavers are almost impossible to fully remove oil - especially on some newer synthetics but our crew did a fine job on this project. Took their time and followed the process @ Rancho Palos Verdes, California
1244 2018-08-24 21:04:46 I went waaaay too long without an oil change due to procrastination and there have been no repercussions. I made it.
1245 2018-08-24 21:04:33 As American Russia hysteria drives the news cycle here is a quote from Germany's Merkel " Germany Cannot Give Up On Cooperation with Russia in Oil and Gas."    USA hysteria is pushing Russia/Germany even closer.

1249 2018-08-24 21:03:55 "In 1990, Blavatnik and Vekselberg co-founded the Renova Group for  large-scale investments in energy, infrastructure, aluminum and other  metals. One of their earliest investments was in Tyumen Oil Co. (TNK),  founded in 1995."
1250 2018-08-24 21:03:41 the grassroots route generally fails to the complexity of the number of stakeholders involved in the bid 'spectrum'. Bids are really n extension of local authorities as the L.A collects the levy. The Levy should be used to build,innovate,improve and nurture anything that 1/2
1251 2018-08-24 21:03:37 no oil will cause it not to crank too
1252 2018-08-24 21:03:20 I just made boxed cake & was cranky about how we have to add all these pesky not-in-the-box ingredients. When boxed mixes first came out, one just had to add water. But buyers felt like cake, a celebratory item, should require more effort, so now we add eggs & oil too. 
1253 2018-08-24 21:03:13 As American Russia hysteria drives the news cycle here is a quote from Germany's Merkel " Germany Cannot Give Up On Cooperation with Russia in Oil and Gas."    USA hysteria is pushing Russia/Germany even closer.

1259 2018-08-24 21:02:31 Hi Doug happy to answer.  IT is largely because the APC party which was in power for nearly 40 years focused almost exclusively on ensuring their chief backers US oil companies stayed happy. Since exporting crude to the US was the most profitable that is exactly what they did
1260 2018-08-24 21:02:27 Congress & Left want to use UAE donation for their 2019 Election, otherwise tell those UAE Sheikhs to go down in muds & help people, oh they can give subsidy on oil too.But not, UAE wants to help Congress & Left

1270 2018-08-24 21:01:30 Governor, you were generous with your time. Thank you. However. The pipelines cannot be made safe. Full stop. They break, crack, fail, spill and foul everything the oil touches. That’s a fact. You cannot build a pipeline that ensures water safety. It’s not possible. Period.

1281 2018-08-24 21:00:35 And the oil embargo was a response to the Japanese invanding Indo-China and refusing to leave. They should've reconsidered if oil was that important to them.

1297 2018-08-24 20:58:43 The Spanish won't need to buy Italian olive oil, because the UK won't be able to stop buying EU olive oil.

1305 2018-08-24 20:57:10 Alberta oil is going to come one way or another. I guess rail tankers are a safer way. Trains pollute and more of a chance of accidents than pipe lines. Just ask the people of Quebec.
1306 2018-08-24 20:56:53 Yea a oil change shouldn’t be more than $40 and an alignment should be pretty cheap as well but yea take someone who knows about cars. Cause I personally would do the oil change by myself

1320 2018-08-24 20:55:20 You put essential oil you like on your palms and rub it on the dryer balls. Between loads put the dryer balls in a ziplock to maintain the fragrance.

1345 2018-08-24 20:51:11 Let's just go slightly wider.

Who trusts economists to forecast 15 years into the future.

Let's take 1999 onwards, they missed - dot com bubble, GFC, Greek crisis, China, oil price run up, QE, EZ crisis to name but a few - so any predictions were useless.
1346 2018-08-24 20:51:08 "You were the aggressors in 1853, so us destroying China and bombing your harbor and killing 3,000 men over oil,  is completely justified, you hypocrite."

1355 2018-08-24 20:50:23 Yep, if they start behind my eyes I can usually hold them at bay (there, but manageable). The base of the skull means certain death. I used CBD oil and it helps enough to keep me from vomiting all day.
1356 2018-08-24 20:50:16 seems right. that people think there's someone capable of selling them this is why there's so much snake oil
1357 2018-08-24 20:50:15 Does anyone know where I can get some good CBD oil in the UK?
1358 2018-08-24 20:50:11 Well Scotland been daft enough to hand over revenue for oil for past 50 yrs !!!
1359 2018-08-24 20:50:07 I have a home business and one of the products i promote is CBD oil.  So in that since yes.
1360 2018-08-24 20:50:02 There are some who say the three-year thing is a bit excessive. But even if we stretch it to four years, that admittedly is still a bit steep. And yes, oil consumption can be a bit high. The Twin Spark engines ain't for the parsimonious, that's for sure.

1369 2018-08-24 20:48:45 Probably waiting for another tanker to do a ship to ship oil transfer, whilst they wait for market prices to change, pumping water out above waterline means ship is light, so oil tanks on that one probably empty

1417 2018-08-24 20:40:59 @ZoesKitchen if your customers ask for just olive oil and vinegar on the side as dressing and not the pre-made blend - will the kitchen have that for them? Your olive oil blend is not 100% olive oil and I don’t like to consume it.
1418 2018-08-24 20:40:54 lol no, those types of "studies" are commonplace I remember some years ago when the WHO declared Potatoes bad , then 2 weeks later, good, then 3 weeks later bad, then 2 weeks after good, same for Olive oil, ignore those studies, as its propaganda from some interest group

1430 2018-08-24 20:38:02 Of course she does. The president would have had to take it away. Obama didn’t, and it’s obvious that Trump hasn’t or he’d really have been boiled in oil in the press

I also do henna treatments once a month and I deep condition with each wash (weekly or every second week).

1451 2018-08-24 20:34:52 Well, that argument makes no sense. Oil prices are up. How does that drop energy prices. Gas prices are so high that poor people can't afford to fill the tank so they can go to two minimum wage jobs.

1467 2018-08-24 20:33:32 The last times most of the coal, gas, oil, = SEQUESTED carbon,was under ground. Now it is now back in the environment, and once the ice and ocean temperatures catch up (which they can't avoid) it is over for most life on this rock, at least till another god come along ;)

1472 2018-08-24 20:32:55 In a sane world, each region would have enough oil, nat gas, hydro electric power, gold, copper, and all other minerals and crops to run a fully functioning economy with no imports or exports. 

But we don't live in a perfect world
1473 2018-08-24 20:32:54 It is in the SNP manifesto from 2014!! Oil would be our main income. If we voted Yes back then we would be utterly ruined now! Your not answering my points but deflecting...classic nat and snp tactic hence why independence will never win.
1474 2018-08-24 20:32:47 It has everything to do with individuals Leaving it up to the government is lame 
It’s about consumer demand 
It’s going to be years before we transition  Using Canadian oil & keeping the money inside Canada interim helps us move in the right direction

1488 2018-08-24 20:30:24 Precisely. My point is that in media - social or otherwise, there's very little middle ground with the takes. Debates on this story is very thin on actual facts - both on the 'coconut oil is poison' (not true), and counterarguments (people used it for centuries, hence safe- no) .

1516 2018-08-24 20:26:52 Even changed the oil
1517 2018-08-24 20:26:32 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1518 2018-08-24 20:25:58 I'm very positive. 
Hybrid: 
- faults from both technics 
- Still using gas (that will be obsolete in most places)
- some charges battery with petrol
- missing the fun with electric cars
- last grasp to keep the oil flowing

Whose going to pay when the pipeline eventually has a leak? We are, not the rest of Canada esp Alberta.
1528 2018-08-24 20:24:37 The issue of suddenly the UK is irrelevant in EU exports and wont be missed but the EU will buy said goods if not exported to UK...hence the Spanish buying Olive Oil?? And so on...as per replies to these posts previously
1529 2018-08-24 20:24:37 They didn't get any oil. It was to bring that oil into the market to lower the price. That was not the POINT. Watch the video or piss off. I have no time to educate you.
1530 2018-08-24 20:24:26 cut into pats at least a tablespoon of butter per steak and pop that in the freezer. put some canola oil in a stainless pan and turn the heat to high under the pan. get it SCREAMING hot. put the steak in the pan for about 30 seconds per side.
1531 2018-08-24 20:24:23 That oil money means a lot to you eh ?
1532 2018-08-24 20:24:11 Oil iuuiiuj
1533 2018-08-24 20:24:11 im absolutely covered in shea butter and coconut oil rn hugging a huge alpaca plush
1534 2018-08-24 20:24:02 Had to get that oil change
1535 2018-08-24 20:23:55 oil has been CHANGED BAYBEE
1536 2018-08-24 20:23:43 Valio verga mi motor got to pull it out again and literally rip it apart for a $20 oil squirter gasket FML!!! 
1537 2018-08-24 20:23:29 All the Red Cap T-Chiefs are on the run. Mitt Romney was right about the Red Oil salesman.
1538 2018-08-24 20:23:00 Mi Kee smelt his past as he remembered the troops herding the villagers together; pouring oil over them before throwing the burning brands but that was Justice – they hadn’t paid their taxes – they knew the punishment.
1539 2018-08-24 20:22:57 Car note paid , oil change done , phone bill paid, Adulting is going swell 
1540 2018-08-24 20:22:55 However as shite as the chap was in the first battle he full on fluked the 4th. Tried ramming the storm fortress did nothing, fired a broad side ended up right in front of her bow and used burning oil to devastating effect.
1541 2018-08-24 20:22:52 We hereby deny you clean water and air. Until you can stop poisoning anyone's land, water & air with products we know cause disease & death regularly when there are alternatives readily available, you don't get to breathe with the rest of us. Enjoy your glass of oil.
1542 2018-08-24 20:22:44 .@mazda_UK why DM? Think you should make all your potential customers aware that if you miss one service (but have subsequent ones) your engine May destroy itself because the engine thins he oil with diesel
1543 2018-08-24 20:22:43 Not just the oil, but u think changing oil is a small thing to do 
1544 2018-08-24 20:22:38 Same! My dad everytime i see him asks me if i checked the oil and my reply is always “no” 
1545 2018-08-24 20:22:37 Anyone who has general day to day anxiety I highly recommend to try cbd oil
1546 2018-08-24 20:22:31 Where is the link to the study? They live longer because they eat veggies, fruits and grains and get exercise - not because of the endothelial damaging olive oil (100% fat, no fiber, nutrients excised in processing).
1547 2018-08-24 20:22:22 @ImranKhanPTI

What about OIL Exploration?

I heard With IRAN we have an Agreement (Treaty...etc) forbidding Pakistan for Oil Exploration because of below See level...may be in PPP Govt time..pls. revisit that as well.
1548 2018-08-24 20:22:21 Oil Sykes looks abit different after hibernation 
1549 2018-08-24 20:22:20 I have a scrub i make at home using brown sugar, honey, lemon juice, and coconut oil, and sometimes oats. You can buy a nice scrub or make one on your own. I also heard you can use like an exfoliating loofah. It also hurts less if you trim the hair as short as possible
1550 2018-08-24 20:22:12 Geez no wonder he closed his account! If he is so stupid why were all you losers following? recent trades: EEM XLP TLT OIL NG long/short long gld/gdx was to early & I was stop out other than that boys I've been ringing the register  I wish you folks nothing but the best! 
1551 2018-08-24 20:22:04 Dude. Seriously.

The American government has, over and over again, disregarded treaties it has made with the Native American tribes concerning their lands.

They continue to do it to this day. Oil pipelines and mining are just the two most recent.
1552 2018-08-24 20:21:23 the smell of tea tree oil >>
1553 2018-08-24 20:21:21 I am so thankful for my new obsession!  It calms me, and just makes me feel amazing in so many ways!  Better than your old cbd oil!  
1554 2018-08-24 20:21:17 set the sous vide temp about 3 degrees below the perfect temp you want. Oh, and put either red wine or red wine vinegar in the bag. you want oil, slat & pepper, spices, herbs if you want and an acid.
1555 2018-08-24 20:21:03 Water disposal for oil wells. Let start it soon
1556 2018-08-24 20:20:55 It's the face you pull when you've lit a flame under your Rosemary oil and are waiting for it to take effect.
1557 2018-08-24 20:20:38 Yup. But they are very able to point to things like the ”whisky tax” or wrongly allocated oil revenues or highlight spurious data. But they don’t.

Why do you think that is?
They point to lots of other faults from Westminster.
1558 2018-08-24 20:20:22 The fantastic new campaign from @OrangutansSOS - raising money to turn an oil palm plantation back into a rainforest for #orangutans and other #wildlife.
1559 2018-08-24 20:20:20 I love my oil diffuser sm
1560 2018-08-24 20:20:19 i LOVE sous Vide. OK, KNOW how you like your steak, the temperature, that is. Season the steak. ALWAYS use at lease freezer bags (Ziplock freezer bags are perfect) Put in butter or olive oil, salt, pepper and nutmeg (the magical meat spice)
1561 2018-08-24 20:20:17 Lol! Stop! Looks & sounds like he is eggbound. Needs a wire brush & castor oil. 
Thanks for the laughs tweeps. Must dash & walk the dogs. Catch you all laters. 
1562 2018-08-24 20:20:16 Well, but so is cold pressed olive oil. I was thinking of raw as meaning "unadulterated" in original form, and processed as "you had to do something to it first."

I can see though I'm going to have to resolve raw blood vs cooked blood and my search history is gonna be great.
1563 2018-08-24 20:20:11 Still odd that you joined against an independent oil and gas company though, what was the rationale?
1564 2018-08-24 20:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1565 2018-08-24 20:19:45 my mom gave me some of her cbd oil and that shit tasted more foul than any edible i have ever eaten i felt it in my soul
1566 2018-08-24 20:19:39 What about the oil that is left on the egg?
1567 2018-08-24 20:19:36 @semccalljr 6.) Who is widely considered the wealthiest man who also monopolized the oil industry?
1568 2018-08-24 20:19:29 She forget to mention your olive oil voice and guinea charm.
1569 2018-08-24 20:19:25 You want food security in Canada, you must support our farmers.  Good god, we subsidize oil companies to the tune of $billions and you complain about supporting the people that feed us.   US farmers are subsidized.
1570 2018-08-24 20:19:00 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
1571 2018-08-24 20:19:00 Cher also flew all the way to Ireland to protest the oil and gas that powered the plane…
1572 2018-08-24 20:18:59 I straighten it, so I have to hit it with that coconut oil and hydrating mask combo once a week  lmao 
1573 2018-08-24 20:18:56 Meanwhile the planet burns, the seas die and the air turns toxic. They've been taken over by internationalists who share a toilet with globalists who in turn are very friendly with major corporations like, well, big oil.
1574 2018-08-24 20:18:54  It wasn't legal long in Alabama. 8 WEEKS? This was SUPPOSED to be LAW in all 50 States. WHY IS #ALABAMA ATTACKING #CBD OIL PATIENTS? @POTUS / @REALDONALDTRUMP  please HELP these CITIZENS of the #UnitedStates #POTUS #PLEASE
1575 2018-08-24 20:18:42 Kaycee needs to wear hats more often. Much more flattering than her olive oil bun look  #bb20
1576 2018-08-24 20:18:35 FTR, Alberta's biggest & growing job sector is in the alternative energy field. Killing Indigenous peoples to line big oil's pockets is a piss poor idea of a job producing economy, especially when alternatives are available right now, which includes oil for cars & homes
1577 2018-08-24 20:18:22 I'm not sure they understand just how big this is *if* it's anywhere close to being true.
1578 2018-08-24 20:18:15 Twitterやったことない人ってどのぐらいいるんだろう

｢私、Twitterやったことないよ！」って人だけRTお願いします
1579 2018-08-24 20:18:03 I have a lot of sympathy, & had long-since distanced myself from the course that it took - incl being disgusted by Alex's Sandy Hook and other statements & entirely opposed to the Snake Oil supplements.

But, yes, it is a Frankenstein I helped create, my job to #unpluginfowars
1580 2018-08-24 20:17:54 I have no shame and will cheat by using a cup of mayo, 1/2 juice from fresh lemon, 5 crushed garlic cloves. It will be a bit too thick, so add a bit of olive oil to get the right consistency.
1581 2018-08-24 20:17:36 You are an idiot.  They (Russia) wish to cripple our oil industry so everyone pays sky high prices.  Same with China get us to adopt Paris, with them having zero intentions of complying.  No one walks from total petro dependence in our lifetime.
1582 2018-08-24 20:17:30 Giraffes actually have really bombass eyelashes, like daaamn y’all use coconut oil or sumthing
1583 2018-08-24 20:17:27 #RVA #Amtrak #CSX Can we please discuss the squeaky rail situation in #ShockoeBottom? Now I'm not sure whose responsibility it is to oil or otherwise maintain the tracks, but there has got to be a better way! I'm not even gonna start on the blasting horns at 3am...
1584 2018-08-24 20:17:12 Baby oil
1585 2018-08-24 20:17:05 anybody wanna donate to this oil change ? 
1586 2018-08-24 20:17:04 Get well Robert . Good luck Hinch
1587 2018-08-24 20:17:02 Next time my toes get cold, I’m mixing up me some goose grease, skunk oil and rabbit fat...
1588 2018-08-24 20:17:01 Bio based Plastics are all over the place. Corn, soy... Waste from oil is cheaper and therefore required by Debt Slaves who are broke. 

1% first. 
War 2nd. 
Earth last. 

Anti-Pollution is AntiBank.
1589 2018-08-24 20:16:59 Syria's oil production by 2009 had declined to below domestic consumption projections and was not competitive cost wise compared to the rest of the producers in the region. Other goods face more inspections but are not banned from sale. Luxury goods are imported via Lenanon.

1591 2018-08-24 20:16:32 I don’t know if I’ve silently laughed harder to myself than when my coworkers were taking about that “really fancy oil place Doo-terrah” 

But this one is ~specially blended~ for headaches, you guys!
1592 2018-08-24 20:16:15 I love pure poison nd that too virgin ! I mean virgin coconut oil 
1593 2018-08-24 20:16:13 When you lied when Joe asked what did Russia need help with after they hacked the documents and you mocked your critics by saying "To steal more documents" when it's your own TYTNetwork that reported over & over they needed oil sanctions and magnitsky act relief.
#ZeroIntegrity
1594 2018-08-24 20:16:12 && oil change
1595 2018-08-24 20:16:10 Chale oil gorico fune.. 8 pm ahí, tas avisau
1596 2018-08-24 20:16:07 Jajajaja amigo te daré un ejemplo de que para ser un buen líder o gente de negocios no se necesita estudiar en grandes universidades .si no me crees investiga la vida del hombre más poderoso en standard oil. David Rockefeller ese tipo fue un pobre muy pobre
1597 2018-08-24 20:16:03 I just get the feeling it needs to be more grassroots!
1598 2018-08-24 20:16:01 What that Scotland would fund itself via oil to combat the billions lost from the UK? Yeah mate, it was in the SNP manifesto. Most of us who voted no would vote yes if it was clear we could do it...sadly the SNP made up shite and continue to do so.
1599 2018-08-24 20:15:57 
Metaphorically speaking add more oil
1600 2018-08-24 20:15:54 The bottom line is that gas power plants are cheaper. Adam Smith's invisible hand is going to brush coal away. That being said, I do support Trump's plan to move American lighting to whale oil.
1601 2018-08-24 20:15:50 Oh man. I ran out of a major oil I need and now have to go to the grocery on a Friday. 

Crapity crap.
1602 2018-08-24 20:15:49 One more thing- Beware of snake oil salesmen selling Socialism as a cure for all of man’s problems! Socialism sucks! (Alliteration is awesome!)
1603 2018-08-24 20:15:46 I had a panic attack today in a store. My boyfriend left me for like 20 SECONDS to pick up olive oil. And I was so fucking bad.. Just by being alone for 20 Seconds in a public place.. 
1604 2018-08-24 20:15:43 Ici je vois bcp de gens qui parlent la langue de Molière ces derniers temps mais MDR moi je vais continuer à parle la langue d’oïl 
1605 2018-08-24 20:15:43 Are asking if they have oil?
1606 2018-08-24 20:15:42 Hey dummy, the US led the world in carbon emissions reductions in 2017, for the 9th time in 15 years mostly due to fossil fuels and cleaner domestic oil production. Meanwhile, almost every nation participating in the Paris Agreement has increased and/or cheated their goals.
1607 2018-08-24 20:15:18 Like i said, Chris watts was a good ol southern boy and dropped his daughters in oil barrels but ya know, keep thinking illegals are your biggest fear. 
Its beyond disrespect to disregard the family of the decedant's request
1608 2018-08-24 20:15:10 We have all the alternatives we need now. The only impediment to our not using them fully, & over the last 50 yrs, is the deep pockets of the oil industry who buys, bullies, & intimidates all to continue lining their pockets. They won't be happy until the last sale goes through.
1609 2018-08-24 20:15:07 Fun fact: Earl Grey used to be my favorite tea when I first started drinking tea. But soon afterwards my legs started cramping so badly I went to the doctor. It was found that some people who drink EG tea have leg cramps due to the Oil of Bergamot in it.

Maybe not that fun...
1610 2018-08-24 20:14:56 u know ur life is going downhill when the last juul pod u have is leaking but u still let the oil get in ur mouth
1611 2018-08-24 20:14:46 I was so sloppy today... Burnt my forearm with oil. Shit hurt a lot 
1612 2018-08-24 20:14:42 But isn't Saudi Arabia who apply sanctions to others... But I get what you mean and it's true, and don't forget that country is rich in oil, so it will always be an ally
1613 2018-08-24 20:14:35 Because of #JeffSessions? They are attacking CANCER & EPILEPSY patients in #Alabama for #CBD oil. AL suddenly made #CBDOIL illegal. Like the bogus #OperationCandyCrush in TN. If sick people in AL order cbd oil via mail, they'll get #Busted if caught. CBD heals, not get you HIGH.
1614 2018-08-24 20:14:15 Sometimes you need to accept the truth in other to grow. We can’t see beyond oil and that’s really pathetic .
1615 2018-08-24 20:14:13 So my car just gone remind me I need an oil change every time I get in this bitch lol
1616 2018-08-24 20:14:05 It's cooking with canola oil time aka chase boots from the tongs I'm using
1617 2018-08-24 20:14:04 I got so many compliments on my new body oil yesterday it smells so amazing. Seasons bouta change and my fall body oils are crackk. Ima need the oil shop to have my vanilla scents this time.
1618 2018-08-24 20:13:49 5 min after picking my car up from an oil change I have to go to discount tire cause my low tire pressure light came on I think I have had enough adulting for this week
1619 2018-08-24 20:13:49 I sent emails to my reps, but I'm from Oklahoma. My reps suck coal and oil for breakfast.
1620 2018-08-24 20:13:42 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,

1621 2018-08-24 20:13:32 I like to use coconut oil then hairspray!! It works wonders!! 
1622 2018-08-24 20:13:27 Wait so oil free doesn’t mean that the actual product doesn’t have oil in it?????
1623 2018-08-24 20:13:18 Thinking of you guys, and Robert...Stay strong have a clean race  get some hardware for Robbie. #GetWellWickens
1624 2018-08-24 20:13:03 Love the hats! #Red4Robbie 
1625 2018-08-24 20:12:58 not sure if it's oil or melted/congealed plastic. And found on the Blackwater Estuary, close to the 'de-commisioned' nuclear power plant...
1626 2018-08-24 20:12:55 Add the 42 million people who work in oil&gas and related fields and damn... that's a lot of rich people hating on you. I'm starting to think that those rumours of sabotage and of links between shortsellers and the oil industry might be true.
1627 2018-08-24 20:12:52 Thank you. Haven’t played with oil paint in awhile, so fairly new ground for me
1628 2018-08-24 20:12:48 My sensible suggestion is burning rosemary oil with a couple of drops of melissa. Odd, but it seems to help soothe my migraines 
1629 2018-08-24 20:12:46 Because of #JeffSessions? They are attacking CANCER & EPILEPSY patients in #Alabama for #CBD oil. AL suddenly made #CBDOIL illegal. Like the bogus #OperationCandyCrush in TN.

1630 2018-08-24 20:12:31 Aminarosel, since you "know about oil industry " do you understand/ know the resent stand/development in developed countries about oil?  The oil our politicians are killing for will soon because less relevant
1631 2018-08-24 20:12:06 Dooms day is coming. While in school in 1990's there was a paragraph which predicted oil will be exhausted on earth by 2020.Hmm not likely. Fear is no one will take it seriously when shit is real.
1632 2018-08-24 20:11:50 Oil the wheels of your megalomania is what it sounds like. The only pathological trait you demonstrate is apparent disdain for anyone you deem less worthy than yourself. We’d better make your ‘special lane’ a dual carriageway to better accommodate your oversized ego!!!
1633 2018-08-24 20:11:43 Do they have oil? Can we invade?
1634 2018-08-24 20:11:11 IM GETTING MY OIL CHANGED AND THIS GIRL IS BLASTING IDOL IN HER HEADPHONES. WE REALLY ARE EVERYWHEREEEEEE
1635 2018-08-24 20:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: spicy crust with greasy coconut oil and pineapple.
1636 2018-08-24 20:11:00 Hello Berkeley and how are you doing tonight my dear and sweet friend I'm doing good Remember I told you I thought I had a earache it turned out my ears are clogged up and I can't hear to good I tried putting baby oil in my ear that softens everything up I luv 2 hear from you
1637 2018-08-24 20:10:57 My doctor told me to have sex i wasn’t feeling it...i danced bought a yoga ball walked castor oil primrose oil ate pineapple EVERYTHING
1638 2018-08-24 20:10:49 Hi Oil!
I'm your biggest fan!
Your funny!
Your friendly!
1639 2018-08-24 20:10:30 I think the turbo gave out and drained the oil res...but either way it don't look good! Lol
1640 2018-08-24 20:10:25 Trump would LOVE to help Venezuela if he could get their oil. 

Unfortunately, the shit gibbon clearly doesn't understand the issues and will only offer a military solution but he doesn't know which side to attack.
1641 2018-08-24 20:10:21 シエル君撫でたら睨まれちったよ(；｀ω´)
1642 2018-08-24 20:10:11 If I had one of those I’d be living off chips and doughnuts. It’d be like university again, only hopefully with fewer complaints that I stink of cooking oil!
1643 2018-08-24 20:10:04 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
1644 2018-08-24 20:10:03 No worse, superyacht, like an oil rig for rich people
1645 2018-08-24 20:09:58 I will never ever grow tired of coming back to my home, it being silent & clean, washing the day off, applying lavender oil & climbing into bed 
1646 2018-08-24 20:09:38 Besides the oil there HAS to be a major change in the port revenues!  #Barqah has ports and might have quite a few! Their income ALL goes to private company in #Misrata no matter how denied!  Port income HAS to stay with the region where the port is located.  Just has to!
1647 2018-08-24 20:09:34 The Deep State is ginning up war with Iran even though our "ally" Saudi Arabia is the center of terrorism. But the kicker is present-day Iran is due to our "friends" at the CIA: 65 Years Ago Today, the CIA Conspired with the UK to Overthrow Iran on Behalf of Big Oil
1648 2018-08-24 20:09:21 I would first get barrels of oil, pour it on the land. Burn my equipment, pour sand into the gas tank start it up. Then burn them. Burn the farm down. Then get out of Dodge. That land will be useless for decades. Leave a note and say good luck. My opinion only.
1649 2018-08-24 20:09:09 Lol, football coaching is such snake oil bullshit.
1650 2018-08-24 20:09:03 Would you have preferred that petrochemicals were never discovered?  Do you honestly think that society at large would be better off today?  The world isn't perfect, but to ignore the vast improvements to life that "big oil" has allowed is bullshit.
1651 2018-08-24 20:08:59 Whenever I order anything from Seamless & mistakenly hit check out before I've had a chance to write "EXTRA HOT SAUCE (HOT OIL,IF THERE'S ANY) & manage to get thru to restaurant before they've sent order to kitchen, I literally feel like I've saved myself from falling off a cliff
1652 2018-08-24 20:08:39 Khasara bhi km hoga aur mulk main oil usage bhi km ho jaye gi train sey
1653 2018-08-24 20:08:37 Yup. You never know how much crap you've accumulated until you have to lay your hand on every single piece of it...
1654 2018-08-24 20:08:36 Ha! My lols over your comment pretty much erased any illusion my co-workers may have that I was actually doing work.
1655 2018-08-24 20:08:31 so two days ago i burned my hand trying to flip a tortilla and now i just burned my finger with hot oil. yeah im never cooking again
1656 2018-08-24 20:08:29 My mom brought me a new fuzzy blanket, candles, soup, crackers, tea annnndd cbd oil! I don’t deserve my momma.

1658 2018-08-24 20:08:18 The bad part of his take was the hating asparagus. Like how do you fuck up asparagus. A little oil and a lil pepper boom delicious.
1659 2018-08-24 20:08:17 Better off without the country that provides most the Oil and gas, exports billions worth of whiskey to the far East? Yes UK well better off without Scotland, let England keep Wales with all it's Coal that was popular in the 19th century...
1660 2018-08-24 20:07:56 “The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.”

1662 2018-08-24 20:07:32 My mom is begging me to call one of my ex-boyfriends so she can commission an oil painting from them. 

I told my mom that I've never dated a painter and she said "What the fuck were those guys' deals then?"
1663 2018-08-24 20:07:24 Literally made it in 3 minutes. Open bag of salad and empty it into bowl, mix balsamic vinegar & olive oil them pour over it and stick two left over BBQ chicken thighs in there. Job done.
1664 2018-08-24 20:06:58 remember when skin care twitter was like ~coconut  oil is soooo good for ur skin ~ when it actually clogs pores and causes acne lmao
1665 2018-08-24 20:06:57 You could changing the oil on the car and if you have a child the mother of that child will be upset that you didn't instantly drop everything you are doing at that moment to help the child then ask is the car ready to drive haha.
1666 2018-08-24 20:06:45 Hey US Oil Industry. Stop refusing to take credit cards at so many of your gas stations across the country. This is 2018, get with the program and acknoweldge customer needs and wants. I think you can afford the credit card fees.  @arco 
1667 2018-08-24 20:06:33 @HeyAprill just searched your name and “hyaluronic acid” and got tons of tips. I’m hoping this is the answer to helping my face not be an oil slick that needs 10 blotting sheets a day. 
1668 2018-08-24 20:06:00 btw ur getting finessed if you get ur oil changed every 3k miles just lyk

1671 2018-08-24 20:05:41 It is time to go and get an oil changed

1673 2018-08-24 20:05:36 Probably my final tweet about Albert, but since he’s leaving tomorrow he’s giving me all his food. A very nice gesture until u realise what he’s actually got left in his cupboards. Half a bottle of oil, a small opened pack of carrots, 5 tea bags and tin of veg soup.
1674 2018-08-24 20:05:33 Can of sardines w/ the olive oil
1675 2018-08-24 20:05:25 A Socialist country with bad economic performance SHOCKING
1676 2018-08-24 20:05:17 Hmmm, we’ve a misunderstanding somewhere. I’m suggesting nobody knows how hot their oil gets for frying. Unless you’re saying that it’s always 170? Or you have a fryer with a thermometer and I’m in the dark ages using my wok!
1677 2018-08-24 20:05:13 Uhhhh who got a valid oil plug? Cuz I obviously dont lmao
1678 2018-08-24 20:05:10 only thing I have rn is Tressume Flawless Curls S+Con — but I usually mix a reg con. & a deep (Shea Moisture, Coconut oil or Argan) to leave in for a curly style
1679 2018-08-24 20:05:07 No hairball problem with the current Siamese kitty, but in the past I have had success with other non-meezer kitties by giving them tuna with a little olive oil mixed in.
1680 2018-08-24 20:05:03 Wanna take a nap but my oil change will be done in less than an hour 
1681 2018-08-24 20:05:02 Saudi Arabia is to oil as Iowa is to soil!
1682 2018-08-24 20:04:35 As far as the LOC/LCO method goes...is Jane Carter Nourish & Shine considered a butter or an oil? It melts in your hand so I wasn’t sure.
1683 2018-08-24 20:04:27 Especially around the nose, gotta keep oil safe
1684 2018-08-24 20:04:16 Bombbbbb my curls were living and they loved it. I usually have no definition after washing and conditioning. But after I wash this out they’re super curled. I add a little Jamaican castor oil, tea tree oil, and sometimes Argan/vitamin E oil
1685 2018-08-24 20:04:15 Might even see a couple BKP Oil Tankers Heid!
1686 2018-08-24 20:04:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i want henry to fuck said that make me peri thats kawaii oh my fat beaner,
1687 2018-08-24 20:04:00 It is a must. We will admit we're biased but still, even your own diy beard oil works wonders.
1688 2018-08-24 20:03:50 I’m high key excited to go back to school next week. Can’t wait to fk around with oil paints. 
1689 2018-08-24 20:03:31 We are there Friday Saturday and Sunday with our booth doing essential oil techniques and also selling some artwork
1690 2018-08-24 20:03:30 Part 2 - plz let me finish this thought

And Yes there has to be trust while this becomes ingrained within all parties this % agreement will be kept or there will be constant fighting over oil crescent
1691 2018-08-24 20:03:25 John Mcdonald has already called it: they miss spent the oil money.
1692 2018-08-24 20:03:14 and when you're paying 2$+ a liter for gas you're gonna blame the oil industries.
1693 2018-08-24 20:03:10 1. Oil tankers don't transport "tar".

2. There has never been an oil tanker spill off the coast of BC -- as in NEVER.
1694 2018-08-24 20:02:58 Stand fast
Never understood that one
1695 2018-08-24 20:02:46 Omega 3 fatty acid, is a saturated and lenient oil,  compared to Olive oil, unlike compatriot omega6fatty acid. It's belived to be of therapeutic value. And not to High in fats
1696 2018-08-24 20:02:44 Hair brush , coconut oil 
1697 2018-08-24 20:02:22 Lemme get some oil pastels, a blank canvas, and some art classes. Cause you need to be painted 
1698 2018-08-24 20:02:17 Start by making sure that your primer isn't oil free - you need something hydrating (tip: get hyaluronic acid infused skincare products)
I use the @MaxFactor_SA Face Finity All Day Flawless foundation - it's a 3 in 1, medium coverage, but buildable and gives a dewy finish
1699 2018-08-24 20:02:08 alright so i’m bout to do a thing and change my oil by myself so y’all pray i do this right and don’t fuck my car up. will update
1700 2018-08-24 20:02:03 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.
1701 2018-08-24 20:01:56 More than trust but yes for discussion I will agree with you this point.  
IF there can be an agreement on a % [Referral of petroleum resources from Barqah ports to Natl Oil Corporation in Barqah & Barqah Central Bank while reserving the right of the other province in its share]
1702 2018-08-24 20:01:42 Ok this morning it was coconut oil, now booze, what's next oxygen, water?

1705 2018-08-24 20:01:19 Just before Russia got involved militarily in Syria, it was Putin who showed the pictures of massive convoys of ISIS oil trucks traveling back & forth from Raqqa to Turkey. He called out the American delegation saying "you guys really don't see this?"

And what happened next??

1707 2018-08-24 20:01:09 One of my favorite vegan meals I can make is a pasta with red onion, tomato, spinach, all sautéed then throw some balsamic vinegar on it and then take your favorite pasta mix it all together with a little bit of olive oil
1708 2018-08-24 20:01:05 The government of Australia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Nikki Reed in a calico wig.

1716 2018-08-24 19:59:58 And the promise that in 2014 oil revenue would sustain Scotland without the £9 billion from the UK via Barnett formula which turned out to be a wrong promise was ok? Given the GERS figures released this week its clear much of what the SNP promised was seriously wrong back in 2014

1722 2018-08-24 19:59:07 Big oil has requested government assistance to protect its Texas facilities from climate change. Not joking.
1723 2018-08-24 19:58:49 @Spajdi_ My grandparents came from Poland. We have something in common. I want you to get in touch with me I’m a painter of oil’s portrait
1724 2018-08-24 19:58:46 Wednesday's three things: 1. Began a new article on oil boilers. Apparently we were off grid enough to have one when I was a kid. Fascinating times.
1725 2018-08-24 19:58:44 (*´꒳`*)ですです
1726 2018-08-24 19:58:41 I’ve been at El Centro motors for hours just to get my oil changed I’m mad annoyed rn
1727 2018-08-24 19:58:41 This will just destroy our environment and then what will all the money that people make be good for? Our children will curse us when we are safe in our graves. We need to regulate ALL polluters like that of coal and oil
1728 2018-08-24 19:58:34 I think people who take garlic capsules instead of cooking with garlic, fish oil capsules instead of a nice fillet of salmon, or probiotic capsules instead of yogurt, really don't take much pleasure in food.
1729 2018-08-24 19:58:32 However, if fish oil increased risk of prostate cancer by 100% you'd be thinking twice about it.
1730 2018-08-24 19:58:30 I want a wrestling match between Rick and Omarosa, winner gets No. 1 on NYT best seller list. Hot oil variety, please (want to see Rick's famous abs).
1731 2018-08-24 19:58:23 State doesn't want oil to go up and have unlimited money but it's hard to burn futures contracts in that new C-7 Vette. Oil's going higher.
1732 2018-08-24 19:58:15 I made fun of butter coffee for a long time and was into pure IF (just water, coffee, or tea til ~2pm). But I get it now. If only because it's delicious with high quality ceylon and @WildFoodsCo MCT Oil. Still think 0 cal is ideal for ketosis for me. But point: never say never :)
1733 2018-08-24 19:57:45 Certain individuals, for whatever their reasons and purposes, refuse to acknowledge #Barqah has created a valid, legitimate army, air force, and now navy.  So Yes #Barqah CAN govern itself.  

Now the oil revenue questions are major/the deal maker or breaker.
1734 2018-08-24 19:57:45 Because of #JeffSessions? They are attacking CANCER & EPILEPSY patients in #Alabama for #CBD oil. AL suddenly made #CBDOIL illegal. Like the bogus #OperationCandyCrush in TN. If sick people in AL order cbd oil via mail, they'll get #Busted if caught. CBD heals, not get you HIGH.
1735 2018-08-24 19:57:44 be brilliant...we could take some selfies to tweet.
And I could sit in your car and listen to the train song...have a sing along!
1736 2018-08-24 19:57:37 Crude Sold at $80 - $130 between 2010 - 2014.sold $28- $77 between 2015 to 2018. 2010 - 2014 debt upped 100% ,external was was $25b during this good times. Lowered oil revenue times PMB only added a very small faction of debts and external reserve shoot up about 70%. You judge .
1737 2018-08-24 19:57:37 It started with the American Petroleum Institute, who determined that oil -> anthropogenic climate change -> severe damage.
Well before the USSR changed.
1738 2018-08-24 19:57:27 My condolences to you and your family may the comforting wings of God be the oil that soothes each hurt and pain of loss felt! God is able !
1739 2018-08-24 19:57:26 @FrenchMeadow Hi! What oil are your Deep-fried risotto poppers fried in? Im allergic to soy yo
1740 2018-08-24 19:57:12 Oil from your hair will get onto your pillowcase as you sleep, so change your pillowcases weekly to avoid sleeping on oil all night long.
1741 2018-08-24 19:57:11 Protein, carbohydrate...fat and oil
1742 2018-08-24 19:57:10 Its anti corp sector, not enviro, the oil will still flow whether or not pipeline, it comes by rail, massive transport, but these 'enviros' don't target consumption practices, it's just anti pipeline, regardless if it helps cpc who will trash all enviro policies
1743 2018-08-24 19:57:09 He does, but does anyone know the heat of their oil?!
1744 2018-08-24 19:57:03 ...your nails. I also recommend using a solid topcoat along the lines of Seche Vite because it will give your nails that extra bit if structure. And finally, use a good cuticle oil every day and every time your hands have been in contact with water.  it’s a lot, I know!
1745 2018-08-24 19:56:57 Just garlic  “all” and oil “oli” salt and a bit of acid (lemon or vinegar)
1746 2018-08-24 19:56:53 So it costs twice as much for an oil change in cstat than it does in cleburne
1747 2018-08-24 19:56:44 Lol I see
1748 2018-08-24 19:56:43 Just stand still
1749 2018-08-24 19:56:36 Because of #JeffSessions? They are attacking CANCER & EPILEPSY patients in #Alabama for #CBD oil. AL suddenly made #CBDOIL illegal. Like the bogus #OperationCandyCrush in TN.

1750 2018-08-24 19:56:36 Coming to something you check oil with hahaha nice
1751 2018-08-24 19:56:35 Oil! And lots of it!
1752 2018-08-24 19:56:28 yeah, I'm a straight-up coconut oil junkie, so I feel you.
1753 2018-08-24 19:56:26 I've been blessed, to have eaten/loved all fish/seafood, since I was a child. Only ocean-related thing I was not fond of, was. . .cod liver oil.
1754 2018-08-24 19:56:23 Lol Swift oil change wants $95 to change the oil on my Prius. @GermainToyotaNa Help!!!
1755 2018-08-24 19:56:21 Begusarai d main d main ,its too hot 
1756 2018-08-24 19:56:20 Cream colored. It doesn’t smell like tea tree oil at all. More like lavender growing in a forest.
1757 2018-08-24 19:56:13 Oh yeah, that's just like them, to hold breaking news stories.
Snake oil, it's been around a long, long time.
1758 2018-08-24 19:56:05 Who said Americans are surprised though? Interesting too given that there are several studies that contradict this one. It’s like the Harvard professor who said coconut oil was poison yesterday.
1759 2018-08-24 19:56:00 Oil changes have my car feeling so sexy & brand new
1760 2018-08-24 19:55:53 People are really living in Abject poverty, may Allah ease our sufferings.
1761 2018-08-24 19:55:53 I use healthy condiments like olive oil, good spices, zesty lemon to get them to eat.
1762 2018-08-24 19:55:51 Take our oil. 

6-0 up as well and we let it slip
1763 2018-08-24 19:55:50 Yeap. Wait until you move with kids!

1766 2018-08-24 19:55:27 Yo I wanna make my own soaps/moisturizer with essential oils and coconut oil n stuff, it'd be so nice I bet
1767 2018-08-24 19:55:20 So it’s Tokyo Tony’s wahala Reno is looking for  but why tag Blac Chyna?  Then go and look at the comment section, someone said “Reno if you go lower than this you will find crude oil” 
1768 2018-08-24 19:55:12 Oil change guy: *stares awkwardly* “do you smoke?”

1770 2018-08-24 19:55:08 I hate getting oil changes mfs take too long
1771 2018-08-24 19:55:04 For instance, fish oil is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, but because I don’t know of any familial history of that disease, I’m not especially worried about the increased risk.
1772 2018-08-24 19:55:04 The way I jus trashed my room lookin 4 nethin from a tiny clip of an L,  an almost empty oil cartridge, speck of shatter in my desk, nug  off floor..nething-I jus hit Pothead equivalent of crackhead. I need 2 chill n remind myself shit ain’t that serious
1773 2018-08-24 19:54:53 hello !! Are you Adrian..tap tap on the window...
That would be brilliant see your face 
1774 2018-08-24 19:54:44 More pressure on companies like PepsiCo , proctor & gamble     Ben Jerry's Starbucks they need to STOP or we as consumers should boycott their proof until they use a sustainable source of palm oil instead.
1775 2018-08-24 19:54:26 @India_Yamaha 
Experiencing worst service from last many months at VRB Automobiles- Malad Mumbai service centre.. I always have to visit twice thrice after service done at your service station.. do you just wash and change oil and oil filter in service??
1776 2018-08-24 19:54:22 You say let the UN sort it out when they are the very organization I cited that said chemical weapons were used in 2013. The US is not stealing the world oil.
1777 2018-08-24 19:54:18 Personally, I don't see any of the "governments" or provinces able to make this decision. The militias are in power across Libya and they need to agree to any solution. For that they need assurance their rivals won't be able to monopolize oil revenue under any agreement.
1778 2018-08-24 19:53:41 what an exciting day though. Some great footage..bet you all loved it.
Wish I was there..maybe one day I will surprise you..
1779 2018-08-24 19:53:35 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

1780 2018-08-24 19:53:35 I got more oil
1781 2018-08-24 19:53:28 I live for going to get oil changes because I always see my car salesman who is absolutely adorable!
1782 2018-08-24 19:53:22 Who knows what temperature their frying oil is?! 

When you look carefully at John T. Rhode (as i call him) trying food, it’s remarkable how wide he opens his gob.
1783 2018-08-24 19:53:20 Hopefully there was no peanut oil in the milkshakes .  You are 100% right about KFC.. Respect!

1788 2018-08-24 19:51:59 When I worked for @LushLtd in my much younger life they switched to completely palm oil free soap, a bold move considering all the soap they sell, as they felt sustainable palm oil didn’t go far enough, but perhaps it’s better now?
1789 2018-08-24 19:51:59 "I'm dirty, covered in grease and oil, my hands are sore and I found a 750 4 barrel, an aluminum 350 small block intake and new bumpers for the duster. I am beyond stoked."
1790 2018-08-24 19:51:58 Generating revenue with a carbon tax applied to resources like crude oil extracted from endangered landscapes like the Amazon or Arctic Alaska is meaningless for confronting the climate crisis. We need place based action not price based action. #keepitintheground #EndAmazonCrude
1791 2018-08-24 19:51:56 @putemupcdukes the Tesla does what it says. It's nice. The oil and big 3 fighting it  though. It would ruin Exxon Mobil etc...
1792 2018-08-24 19:51:41 This coming from the man that removed the survivors of Benghazi security clearances so they could not testify in a classifed closed door hearing about what happened there. You are a SNAKE oil slaesman & corrupt! We KNOW what you did during the 2016 election. Now you have to pay!
1793 2018-08-24 19:51:27 Energy Transfer Partners once again bullying to make profit while destroying the nations largest river swamp.   Water is more important to the survival of the planet than oil.  Stop this rotten company.
1794 2018-08-24 19:51:26 In Tire Rama getting my papa’s oil change and literally there ain’t nothing but old white men dressed in Levi’s and cow boy boots 
1795 2018-08-24 19:51:03 Probably just as well your not at the moment as far as I can see! #UKOG #HORSEHILL ;)
1796 2018-08-24 19:50:59 That's nonsense. It's the other way around.

Putin and his oil friends have been helping to finance and encourage environmental groups, to try to suppress the oil and gas industries here in the United States.

It's a matter of public record.
1797 2018-08-24 19:50:55 Got the good oil change for the Lac Daddy. Now I need a car wash so I can look like yo daddy forreal.
1798 2018-08-24 19:50:48 Ask your girl to put coconut oil hair masks with you!
1799 2018-08-24 19:50:41 Truly doubt any region going to allow foreign entity first because of sovereignty and second because of terrible experiences through the decades!  Barqah has competent people for a Nat Oil & for a Central Bank.  I do not believe the Tripoli CBL Gov is honest - sorry, just do not
1800 2018-08-24 19:50:34 I hate olives but love olive oil. Hate tomatoes but love ketchup. I should probably never taste blood, huh?
1801 2018-08-24 19:50:33 If you can’t check your own tire pressure, oil, or any other fluids on your car then we can’t be friends #takecareofyoshit
1802 2018-08-24 19:50:16 I better pass my neighbour wey no get engine oil but the person wey dey pull am no Sabi say oil no dey.
1803 2018-08-24 19:50:04 You better throw some rosehip oil &witch hazel in a fancy bottle. Call it a damn day.
1804 2018-08-24 19:50:03 Anyone else take MCT oil swigs and feel like you've been punched in the stomach 15 min later?
1805 2018-08-24 19:50:03 After the stress of college applications and final decisions, the hardest part is dropping them off. Natural gas and oil are there to support both of you along the way.
1806 2018-08-24 19:49:54 I wish water boiled as fast as oil take to get hot.
1807 2018-08-24 19:49:53 Vegan grocery cheese is mostly oil: No evident nutritional value. Nut cheeses are different.
1808 2018-08-24 19:49:48 ni a palo voy a fuel oil
1809 2018-08-24 19:49:39 Just weighing in here in case it applies:  men marry a woman before they live with her.
1810 2018-08-24 19:49:35 We do get real tuna everyday but it is in water.....we will switch to oil.  It makes sense!  Thank you!
1811 2018-08-24 19:49:29 Don't take it to heart Heid. It's just because your not a shorter. x
1812 2018-08-24 19:49:21 So like bulletproof with MCT OIL :)

1814 2018-08-24 19:49:07 I’ve been rewatching it so you should obviously do it. Now excuse me as I do my oil change...
1815 2018-08-24 19:49:06 I dislike getting my oil changed at the quick oil places. They try to sell you everything that they can. Surprised they didn't just offer to sell me a new car while they were at it.
1816 2018-08-24 19:49:04 Plus side of my husband working at a dealership is discounts for oil change and anything else I need done. 
1817 2018-08-24 19:48:58 Noted. Start off with our Liquid African Black Soap, Rosehip oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times), Lemon Brightening Overnight Serum (use daily at night after cleansing), Citrus Exfoliating Scrub (use once/twice a week) & Activated charcoal
1818 2018-08-24 19:48:55 I use vitamin e oil to take off my makeup and I s2g my eyelashes are so soft
1819 2018-08-24 19:48:48 Now we’re talkin. So like bulletproof but with mct oil instead?
1820 2018-08-24 19:48:36 It’s essential oil of tea tree. Igual si usas hojas de eucalipto en vaporizaciones te ayuda y en su defecto, prueba con un poco de Vick vaporub.  Mantén los ojos cerrados mientras haces las vaporizaciones:)
1821 2018-08-24 19:48:32 okay blackout coming, have candles, have a oil lamb, learn to use newspaper,candle-wax, tuna cans to cook your food. Keep on hand food that is dried, like jerky. water, get keg full it with water after the beer is gone. basic needs. if you can , do, if you can;t pray
1822 2018-08-24 19:48:31 Hey, it's restaurant week in Greensboro. The chef's are cutting fat & serving it to you. Get $10.00 worth of food for $20.00. Restaurant week menu planning should read as such; a single olive oil poached kidney bean fussily resting on microgreens and a swirl of cheap balsamic.
1823 2018-08-24 19:48:24 Ghana jollof over Nigerian entire oil ...
1824 2018-08-24 19:48:20 Conditioner, blow dry at medium heat while brushing, beard oil, blow dry again and this time shape and curl where needed, then apply beard balm to keep it set. Then bam
1825 2018-08-24 19:48:14 Red oil and bread
1826 2018-08-24 19:48:10 They really are g. I use every product around girl’s shower when I stay at their place. I’m not about to buy $25 keratin oil conditioner
1827 2018-08-24 19:47:51 Because the market does not know what is going to happen.electric vehicles, peak oil. Plus to get a project of the size required will take at least 5 years to do from first inception to online
1828 2018-08-24 19:47:43 Maybe I just don't know enough Irish history to think lucidly on the subject. Is there lots of oil in Ireland or something?
1829 2018-08-24 19:47:33 When I was little, there were oil pumps in El Segundo painted like giant grasshoppers! I loved those things.
1830 2018-08-24 19:47:19 If FDI’s were solely Oil driven, why do we still have oil companies running in Nigeria bcs that’s a very good example of what a direct investment is.
1831 2018-08-24 19:47:18 The ones that are already a NO vote?
1832 2018-08-24 19:47:16 my dad asked me to bring the truck to get an oil change but didn't specify and I brought the wrong truck
1833 2018-08-24 19:46:56 We deeven have oil g 
1834 2018-08-24 19:46:43 Love to make a cool watercress salad with  tofu, tomatoes, onions & sesame oil.
1835 2018-08-24 19:46:43 So many Fronts got Fuhrer cornered
NY AG civil Charity fraud case
NYAG Campaign Fraud and income tax evasion case
Mueller Ru Mob Putin Conspiratorial 
Case, hacking, social media etc..
Haven’t touched Rosneft oil Treason 
He’s using what’s left under spray tan and comb over sweat
1836 2018-08-24 19:46:43 A large part of the oil industry is state owned yes but much is still privately run.  That's not command economy, even the British government had more state ownership (1950s-1980s) over the economy than Venezuela does now.
1837 2018-08-24 19:46:18 long as you dont block me xxx
1838 2018-08-24 19:46:14 FDI wasn’t on oil uncle. Do you know what FDI means?
1839 2018-08-24 19:46:09 Bullshit but that’s a cost of cleaning up the greatest natural oil spill on earth. 
#Cleantheoilsands
1840 2018-08-24 19:45:59 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
1841 2018-08-24 19:45:48 Dear Eva, can your doctor prescribe you some CBD?

Hemp extract.

"This spring, CBD oil became legal in Indiana. Decriminalizing cannabis extract may seem like a minor development"

"Some people use CBD oil to relieve pain associated with chronic conditions, such as arthritis."
1842 2018-08-24 19:45:34 ok....you are a legend you know xx
1843 2018-08-24 19:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1844 2018-08-24 19:45:02 Medical professionals: Smoking is bad for you.

Some idiot: But I’ve been smoking for decades and I’m fine!

Medical professionals: Coconut oil is bad for you.

Some idiot: But I’ve been using coconut oil for decades and I’m fine!
1845 2018-08-24 19:44:55 They’ve done well but they should sell if it’s an Oil sheikh. Who dnt like better ?
1846 2018-08-24 19:44:45 Allow me to finish your Tweet, to wit, “Trump wins more support”
1847 2018-08-24 19:44:27 You mean to tell me that CBD oil will help me, a generally healthy 21 year old, not lay in bed immobile because of pain?? And you don’t want me to have it??
1848 2018-08-24 19:44:20 We are not diversifying anything.  The emphasis we place on oil is not same as the emphasis we place on other sectors.  Heardmen killings is just politicians trying to make gain from a visionless country.  A already failed country. If we must move on,  oil needs to be cut off.
1849 2018-08-24 19:44:09 He needs some swing oil, shot of Fireball would work.
1850 2018-08-24 19:44:01 Not a shampoo... But coconut oil in your hair after is fab! And it's great for a moisturiser too. In fact it does everything! I swear by it. X
1851 2018-08-24 19:43:59 Groupon >>> got a $40 oil change for $25 
1852 2018-08-24 19:43:57 Which FDI's closed shop and when? 
Lol... FDI's were mainly in oil and gas... Oil is not as big a commodity as it was in 2012, ma'am. 

Can you list the "FDI's" that closed shop because of bad policies? Let is be guided please... Smh
1853 2018-08-24 19:43:48 If government could help him then they should, the problem with Reer Somaliland is they don't know politics they only judge on second hand information and perception, and I believe that one of the Muuse Biixi's GOV weakness. His Gov is not playing the media game coz gossip is oil
1854 2018-08-24 19:43:47 Can’t wait until my hair growth oil bottles come and my labels...I can’t waitttt to let ppl sample it
1855 2018-08-24 19:43:41 I see all those ones, but we never solve our problem we want help the world dictate how much them go day sale oil, that one don mark all others wrong na.. lol
1856 2018-08-24 19:43:33 England got £300 billion+ in Scottish oil money to fund English infrastructure projects so not too bad a deal, eh? 
1857 2018-08-24 19:43:12 Whatever you do don't get them at Five Guys. They use peanut oil.
1858 2018-08-24 19:43:10 Gel definitely helps with definition I use eco styler black castor oil/ flaxseed and or aloe vera gel which also helps with defining and moisturizing and the cream helps with the moisture as well for me
1859 2018-08-24 19:43:02 Paper bags also are at issue from my recollection of this debate.  Trees vs. oil product.
1860 2018-08-24 19:43:01 Yes bro for some type of synthetic blend oil. I’m pissed
1861 2018-08-24 19:42:23 After experiencing mild depression and anxiety all my life and post-natal depression, I did internet research. A daily dose (1200 mg capsule) of omega 3 fish oil, plus high dose B vitamins when stressed, works well for me. Anti-inflammatory effect helps my dust-mite allergy too.
1862 2018-08-24 19:42:21 Now the meeting is off?  Maybe someone told Trump how bad this looks - sticking up for a guy who isn’t getting rid of his nukes and just got caught trying to buy oil from Putin. Someone with half a brain talked some sense to him
1863 2018-08-24 19:42:14 I was aware of the existence of port oil infrastructure for both St.John and Montreal, but was not aware of specifics of Line 9, and Jean-Gaulin.
1864 2018-08-24 19:42:11 There are people though who are /proud/ their program didn’t teach this: and then will say nobody’s buying “fine art” or school is “too commercial” (thinking of 90s illustration programs, oil painting, etc)-
1865 2018-08-24 19:42:09 They might be made of oil, Tom. WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE THAT THEY'RE NOT.
1866 2018-08-24 19:41:57 I believe some of the oil companies agree that the climate is changing.  It is the hard core GOP that deny it.  Exhibit 1 is Ted Cruz.  He says this project "is a tremendous step forward".  If it is needed, ask him why it is needed.
1867 2018-08-24 19:41:55 im watching my car get an oil change and it’s raised up on those things they have in auto shops and im nervous for my baby even tho this happens all the time
1868 2018-08-24 19:41:36 Terrorism:  Canada's new export now that oil has been killed off.
1869 2018-08-24 19:41:35 Basically that article tells you about higher grade internals. Light weight piston (vs a chunk of steel), stainless shims (vs some mystery metal the warps), synthetic shock oil (vs whatever hydraulic oil others use), nickel plated shock bodies (vs painted steel that rusts).
1870 2018-08-24 19:41:31 Try Castro oil
1871 2018-08-24 19:41:23 Have u ever tried the oil cartridges
1872 2018-08-24 19:41:15 Yes It's all Tesla's fault that the other dinosaur car makers have had to scramble around to try to compete. Its all Teslas fault that GM F Volvo Lexus BMW Jaguar Porsche sales are hurting. Its all their fault that oil barrens are now taking 5% stakes in Electric Auto companies
1873 2018-08-24 19:41:10 Dave I’ve had @FiveGuysUK once in my life and I will not be having it again, cooking things in peanut oil is gross. And let’s be honest it’s all about @KFC_UKI (will accept free Big Daddy box meal for this promotion!)
1874 2018-08-24 19:40:56 Uh, maybe try oil??? Baby oil. Idk if it works cus I used it around my neck the other time to prevent the colour from staining it and I used gloves >.<
1875 2018-08-24 19:40:49 Lol. Homeboy with low car is trying to get in the middle of the space for his oil change and lol. It’s scraped lol
1876 2018-08-24 19:40:33 none of my friends will go with me to get an oil change I hate all of them
1877 2018-08-24 19:40:31 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
1878 2018-08-24 19:40:18 Coconut oil is poison!!!

1880 2018-08-24 19:40:01 Is is supposed to look as if the model's covered in oil&blood?
1881 2018-08-24 19:39:58 Why is my home, Trans Nzoia trending. Ama Oil imekuwa discovered huko?
1882 2018-08-24 19:39:54 The oil, yes!!
1883 2018-08-24 19:39:48 No. They don’t. The Scottish people’s tax contributions are more than enough to pay for those things you mention. Then there is the income that London receives from the sale of Scottish oil & other exports. It is not the English that should feel short changed here, sorry to say.
1884 2018-08-24 19:39:44 Sana lahat tinototoo naten no? saken ok naman gusto naman kita sana oil talca
1885 2018-08-24 19:39:38 Iran shipments already declining. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil take effect in November, but already countries around the world have been slashing purchases, which are affecting Iran’s exports
1886 2018-08-24 19:39:31 Also,
1. I'm not sure if it's possible to grow a beard without T. Take caution using coconut oil on the face because it could break you out.
2. Top surgery would be an option for a permanent removal of boobs, if you don't want surgery then try purchasing a chest binder (be safe)
1887 2018-08-24 19:39:28 They're going to last for AT LEAST 100 years! My d-i-law did the core testing for North Sea & says with current finds & new technologies to recover it, oil will flow for at least 100 years!
1888 2018-08-24 19:39:21 Galveston Bay Fdn is concerned the barrier would block flows which nourish the bay. They support smaller dike. But projects mostly benefiting oil companies should be paid for by the oil companies.
1889 2018-08-24 19:39:08 Fight for the sake of arm deals and controlling the oil is not about human rights. #Warmonger #WarCriminal
1890 2018-08-24 19:39:04 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.”- Psalm 23:5 #prepared #anointed #overflowed
1891 2018-08-24 19:38:53 Mexico’s incoming president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) is planning to hold off on new oil and gas auctions for two years while also modifying the laws to bolster the role of Pemex,
1892 2018-08-24 19:38:50 I love when I go to the dealership for an oil change the staff call me “Gerald” like we’re good friends.
1893 2018-08-24 19:38:28 Aliyev does what he does because of oil , otherwise he can be made into dust overnight!
1894 2018-08-24 19:38:23 As it sits near a tent made from oil. 

Irrational stooge.

1896 2018-08-24 19:37:52 The southern oil rich city of Basra, Iraq is facing a health epidemic, large number of people have been effected by unsanitary water.

1897 2018-08-24 19:37:51 You need weed or CBD oil my dear
1898 2018-08-24 19:37:25 We know that right. Since oil boom,  looting skyrocketed. Struggling for power became a thing of Make or Mar. We are doomed believing oil was the only resources we've got.  FG claims they are diversifying but we all know it depends on that liquid black gold.
1899 2018-08-24 19:37:16 The best two stroke oil out there!
1900 2018-08-24 19:37:10 You're a lazy Nigerian youth... Lol
1901 2018-08-24 19:37:05 Today is long....oil changes bite!
1902 2018-08-24 19:37:00 No judgement here. I am having a bit of sliced bread, fryed in olive oil and a bit of garlic, topped with tomatoes and chives.
1903 2018-08-24 19:36:58 "So... you're saying because oil is that much more valuable, peoples lives and jobs don't matter?" - to socialists it doesn't seem to matter.

Without an economy, people don't have lives. So pushing for an economically unsound ideology leads to starvation - no surprise there.
1904 2018-08-24 19:36:57 Haha currently have a Manuka honey face mask on and I have feet in foot spa with lavender oil. Nice way to relax after a bad day.
@ortski83 wish I could go to the gym but get so paranoid people are staring at me  men can have pamper nights  x
1905 2018-08-24 19:36:52 the project is controversial w good people on both sides, because it would also "protect homes, delicate ecosystems and vital infrastructure." But the $3.9 billion for three separate, smaller storm barrier projects that would specifically protect oil facilities is absurd.
1906 2018-08-24 19:36:41 Itni oily skin hai ke pori oil factory ban sakti hai xd
1907 2018-08-24 19:36:30 Now don't accuse me of acting like the ability to make sense is prevalent in the oil industry. Heck, I grew up in Houston so I know better. 
1908 2018-08-24 19:36:18 Water costs in Permian. The cost of handling and disposing of “produced” water that comes out of an oil well is rising in the Permian, Costs are rising, and water management can add as much as $6 per barrel
1909 2018-08-24 19:36:16 Is it possible to fry eggs with palm oil?
1910 2018-08-24 19:36:15 Ya know I casually go for a $60 oil change and my total ends up being $250 ..... smh
1911 2018-08-24 19:36:15 If the post-sear is cooking it too much then your pan is not hot enough. I use a cast-iron skillet on my highest burner and a shallow pool of oil, pat steaks dry with a paper towel, put them in when the oil wisps, thirty seconds on a side. The kitchen gets filled with smoke.
1912 2018-08-24 19:35:51 What is samsu oil?
1913 2018-08-24 19:35:49 Shea butter, beeswax,árgan oil, Jamaican castor oil, coconut oil ,
1914 2018-08-24 19:35:45 I thought a 5 min oil change was supposed to take 5 minutes. This PMS bout to fuck’em up!
1915 2018-08-24 19:35:45 Canned tuna in oil. Mash tuna into oil to make sure it gets eaten too. Note - far too much can be a laxative. But cats think it's worth it =^..^=
1916 2018-08-24 19:35:44 Not every day. Like Keri said, it can cause dryness/irritation to the scalp. But when you do wash it, try to oil your scalp with something light, like tea tree or argan oil. That way your scalp can get moisture without your hair follicles being clogged which can cause itching too
1917 2018-08-24 19:35:39 Nutella? 
Unfortunately mostly sugar and palm oil!
1918 2018-08-24 19:35:37 Hasn't considered mct oil. Thanks for the suggestion.
1919 2018-08-24 19:35:37 Hair cream snd oil makes hair soft, shiny, stops breakage, long and dark.. Oil grows beards, keeps them soft and shiny.
1920 2018-08-24 19:35:34 This Harvard professor is a moron. Even he has no data to support his claim. But the whole world is full of ppl living healthy life using the so called pure poison coconut oil. That’s enough.
1921 2018-08-24 19:35:33 i'm getting my oil changed and i feel so awkward i -
1922 2018-08-24 19:35:12 You need Samsu oil plus viagraa den small cocktail 
1923 2018-08-24 19:35:11 I don’t not anything about a car but pumping gas and getting a oil change .
1924 2018-08-24 19:35:08 26 degrees this afternoon in Merthyr, a room with a view and it’s not even your office! Not everyone has an oil rig outside their office.
1925 2018-08-24 19:34:54 My back needs some damn oil 
1926 2018-08-24 19:34:52 It’s EXPENSIVE being Black
Haircuts
Lotion
Coconut Oil

ETC
1927 2018-08-24 19:34:50 Do you know about the oil it is cooked in....
1928 2018-08-24 19:34:39 Shout out to all the women that change their own oil
1929 2018-08-24 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
1930 2018-08-24 19:34:11 @DrGundry Your books say that you shouldn't use olive oil for the first 14ish days but then your phase one recipes call for olive oil.  Which is correct?  My mom will be starting phase one in a few days and I want her to do it right.
1931 2018-08-24 19:34:10 @realDonaldTrump snake oil salesman. No art of the deal here. @POTUS loves to hear himself tell lies! @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Every half hour is another untrue fairytale. How can you tolerate Donnie? #VoteGOPOut

1933 2018-08-24 19:33:49 I wonder if the staid "coconut oil are poison" and "vaccine choice+safety activists are really not people" #FakeNews in the last 3 days are cover for the arrest of former CDC head Tom Frieden? @HealthRanger

1935 2018-08-24 19:33:47 In this hypothetical, do I have disreputable friends who can score for me? Then Xanax.

Am I stuck with over the counter garbage? Maybe get a friend on the coasts to send you some CBD oil. Surprisingly helpful. 

Nicotine in any variety is also good for anxiety. Try the gum.
1936 2018-08-24 19:33:35 Cadburys are evil. They use Palm oil and shut down our factory.

1944 2018-08-24 19:32:05 We had a lot of trouble with the loader lever seizing up as the oil got hot. We swapped them for a Volvo BL71 and an 860SE. We also had a 960 at the time and that beoke down for fun! 
1945 2018-08-24 19:32:00 An imperialist oil war is not in anyway defending or protecting the US
1946 2018-08-24 19:31:47 Sweet potato Gnocchis roasted in Olive Oil w/ fresh Roma tomatos = 
1947 2018-08-24 19:31:45 Maybe the oil and spare parts are in the sidecar.
1948 2018-08-24 19:31:41 It was crippled because of oil boom.  Since we discovered oil,  our focus changed. Greedy politicians took the wheel.
1949 2018-08-24 19:31:41 È chiaro che spingono per accoglienza, fanno soldi a palate con i governi che hanno permesso di impiantare basi di estrazione gas&oil

1951 2018-08-24 19:31:29 oil?
1952 2018-08-24 19:31:18 Ah Richmond. The sweet aroma of scented beard oil, expensive bourbon and black and milds.

Have to say I did miss it. Good to be home.
1953 2018-08-24 19:31:06 But what species of PNW bird uses beard oil and likes fancy donuts?
1954 2018-08-24 19:30:51 Delighted to get rid of them. I used to use them in the back of my old Sherpa van to tie old oil  paintings up safely to the sides. I nearly said tie old masters up but that would be a different story!

1956 2018-08-24 19:30:39 is ANYTHING Tesla’s fault?  
Or is it big oil/the shorts/Grimes/(now)Apple/GM/Ford the whole reason they’re having so much trouble?
1957 2018-08-24 19:30:30 It’s such a shame what the oil and gas industry has done to the natural beauty of WV.
1958 2018-08-24 19:30:30 Gav, Barnet is an ironic bribe with our own money. Scotland is just another colony to be plundered and while we still have Oil, Gas, Whisky, fisheries and Productive land and people they will NOT let us go. Maybe in 100 yrs when we're totally rinsed. #indyref2
1959 2018-08-24 19:30:28 Build that wall ! Build that wall ! Build that wall !  I love it .... all the crybabies out there remember the words of your supreme leader B Hussein Obama “ Elections have consequences” yep that’s what the former snake oil selling liar in chief said. So keep crying

1964 2018-08-24 19:30:04 There was usually a rule that the British bikes ran at the back of the pack because they dropped so much oil ... and the Nortons ran at the back of the British bike group because they dropped parts as well as oil.
1965 2018-08-24 19:30:04 My  goes out to you. Thank you for your service to our country, and I hope you get the help for your PTSD. Not too long ago I watched a Dateline special on cannabis oil (no THC high) that a Vet with PTSD is now taking. He said it saved his life. Something to think about.
1966 2018-08-24 19:30:02 The people of this planet centainly lost it when it comes to :  Cleanliness of the air the seas, the land.  By creating plastics that pollute the ocean and rivers sewage in the oceans and rivers, automobiles and airplanes  that overheat the air, and the oil that they discard.
1967 2018-08-24 19:29:39 The additive is oil via the turbo

1970 2018-08-24 19:29:23 The green movement is creating the energy jobs of the future. Sounds like you prefer the energy jobs of the past. This smells like a astroturfer account. Who are you a front for? Coal? Big Oil? All of the above?
1971 2018-08-24 19:29:19 It’s a pleasure, another note if don’t want a crispy texture replace the oil with melted butter.
1972 2018-08-24 19:29:17 I don’t even think it’s about transporting by pipeline or moving forward with oil. I think it’s the issue if it’s route, and the potential risks it serves for our climate change strategy. Additionally for me there’s economic questions that don’t get answered.
1973 2018-08-24 19:29:14 Current trade relations are strained and bound to get worse. I’d sooner take US shake oil. It’s less dirty and won’t need tankers.
1974 2018-08-24 19:29:13 Even IF Assad is gassing his own people, we don’t belong there. We act as the world police NOT for the benefit of the worlds population. We do it to steal resources, command control over foreign economic policy and keep the power for the oil companies and the world’s elite

1979 2018-08-24 19:28:27 Actually look at 2nd tweet.  I support his stance if it includes action. As far as GHG, there are no regulations in the oil rich countries of the middle east.  Again, concern about GHG is moot if you dont look at a world view. Reducing it here but increasing there is of no value
1980 2018-08-24 19:28:02 I had to get off to make it to my oil change appointment!  but I will be back on afterwards and before work god willing it finishes quickly!

1987 2018-08-24 19:26:57 Naw cbd doesn’t fuck you up. No THC. It should be fine. I hold the oil under my tongue forever and I feel like an enema would be even better.
1988 2018-08-24 19:26:53 I recently read their experimenting with CBD oil & it's effect to reduce anxiety in pets.  Curious of those results when they come in.

1997 2018-08-24 19:24:59 I am trying to avoid palm oil and it's hard. I have avoided it in soaps, shampoos and cleaning products. Best thing is to cook from scratch I think. Nearly all processed foods and ready meals have it in. A great idea and so necessary for those apes.
1998 2018-08-24 19:24:32 didn't see that coming....

What a wonderful Government we have, doing their best to ensure good jobs and remove obstacles to get our oil to tidewater.

Ok, sarcasm over. Fuck, these guys are inept!
1999 2018-08-24 19:24:17 Funny. You forgot to mention the Economic Warfare Central Banks have employed for nearly two decades. 

Gotta get that oil.

2037 2018-08-24 19:20:01 Your argument  is the same one that has been thrown out of court several times, as one judge said those states, cities suing the oil sector for their role with climate change argument has no merit as they were still using the very same product to run their fleets of vehicles.

2040 2018-08-24 19:19:18 1.  Interesting you didn't comment on the tankers like I asked.  I'm not disputing the oil from AB takes more to process, but a single tanker pollutes more than 50million cars. The entire shipping industry pollutes more in a month than all cars in a year.
2041 2018-08-24 19:19:15 The coconut oil is poison debate is hugely exaggerated. It is misleading & nonscientific. Unless you eat just coconut oil and nothing else or depend on it for vading off infectious diseases like Dr. Oz suggested, its pretty much like most other oils. Just don't drink a pint!

2050 2018-08-24 19:18:33 Guys, @neiltyson just said on the @joerogan podcast that microwaves don't make your food poisonous like your essential oil dealer has been telling you. They just make water molecules vibrate. We are now free to be our best selves.

2054 2018-08-24 19:18:05 Can do an oil change - including removing/replacing the sump plug - without getting a spot on her dress.

2061 2018-08-24 19:17:22 THANK YOU BARACK OBAMA
tRUmp has increased the National Debt dramatically.
Oil prices are through the roof.
US Dollars is way down.
Salaries for ordinary folk are stagnant & being wiped out by inflation.
We have a TRAITOR & soon-to-be FELON as our Commander in Chief.
WHAT A JOKE
2062 2018-08-24 19:17:17 Contaba con una de las mayores reservas de petroleo del mundo. Pero necesitaban un régimen "flexible" como el "revolucionario". La Standar Oil por ejemplo luego de la revolución se hizo con la mitad de los campos petrolíferos del cáucaso y millones de dólares en Rusia.
2063 2018-08-24 19:17:12 Soak hands in warm olive oil once a week for strong nails and youthful looking hands.
2064 2018-08-24 19:17:07 There's a little mom and pop auto repair spot in my hometown that sends my wife and I letters for cheaper oil changes, and reminders that they've served us well in the past. I've honestly read one of those and hoped that something minor would fail in my car to give me an excuse

2067 2018-08-24 19:16:53 I meant to bring an oil and pen but figured I wouldn’t need it because it’s just for a few days. I was wrong

2074 2018-08-24 19:16:13 I’m lovin the Youth to the People eye cream as it’s silicone-free, mineral oil, etc. which is hard to find.
2075 2018-08-24 19:16:03 I have one word to say, OIL , OIL enriched money and influence.
2076 2018-08-24 19:15:58 Do you remember that the previous govt didn't save despite the oil boom, and they had to borrow to pay salaries? Have you forgotten that the price of oil fell? Take a look at Venezuela + other OPEC countries, and come back with an intelligent retort.
2077 2018-08-24 19:15:58 That dry ass bitch could benefit from some coconut oil
2078 2018-08-24 19:15:41 It's about converting gas to barrels of oil equivalent, Jerry. This is ordinarily done using ~6,000 cfg/boe based on energy content (Btu). Problem is that the value ratio is 15:1. That means that every boe of gas is inflated 2.5x based on its value. NGL is inflated 2:1.
2079 2018-08-24 19:15:36 So your thesis is that US #refiners, overall industry, the market all failed to prepare for light sweet #crude availability & will take 5-10 years to become able to properly utilize the bounty of shale revolution? Was this willful neglect or just incompetence? #OOTT #oil #energy
2080 2018-08-24 19:15:23 Banana Grove Anniversary Sale this weekend. It's total mayhem and I love it - wait in line for an hour with all the Italian grannies for a free 100g package of black forest ham and $2 off a 3L vat of olive oil.  #EastVan

2082 2018-08-24 19:15:09 @RealDonad_Trump I beg you to please make CBD OIL legal I have severe medical conditions that this oil gives relief to but because it is not legal under federal regulations my husbands WAGE WORKS won't cover this. They would rather have me hooked opiates
2083 2018-08-24 19:15:01 Yes do stop medical treatment and do Phoenix Tears RSO oil and CBD! It killed the tumour that was left in my brain after surgery! Folks with cancer need to do their research! Doctors don't always have the answers! This makes me sad.

2085 2018-08-24 19:14:36 People used to be boiled in oil for their misdeeds.  I'm not advocating this; just stating a fact.
2086 2018-08-24 19:14:35 Country was parted on basis on hindu & muslim in 1947, now why the question is raised & making propaganda for partition of societies by som anti lndians mentelity?

2087 2018-08-24 19:14:35 Slowly, gently rubbing salt or sugar (mixed with oil & scent) all over my skin makes me appreciate my physical body, even when it's sore or bloated or inflamed. I like to do homemade concoctions so it's as simple and hypoallergenic as possible. It's like meditating. Very mindful.

2090 2018-08-24 19:14:13 "The craziest and whitest things in the world cannot be ingested or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2091 2018-08-24 19:14:05 I mean, they work really well. I guess you could use a really heavy oil to replace them?
2092 2018-08-24 19:14:03 But, you have to make sure your hair will absorb the oil. So test a little of it on your hand. If it seeps into your skin your hair will absorb it. If it just leaves your hand greasy you may need to heat it up a bit.
2093 2018-08-24 19:13:57 Horse shampoo, Jamaican black castor oil and no heat!!

2096 2018-08-24 19:13:38 Oh for god’s sake.  These are the experts tell us coconut oil is poison & take no position on the evils of sugar.  Best to just do some educated research & make independent decisions to just enjoy life. (NB fermented food is healthy - especially grapes. )
2097 2018-08-24 19:13:33 i wouldn't pin you as a coconut oil type of person lmao

2099 2018-08-24 19:13:12 Whenever I see a Dawn soap ad showing baby ducks covered in oil getting cleaned, I think of how there haven't been major oil spills lately. Then I assume Dawn dunked those baby birds in motor oil for their ad.

2106 2018-08-24 19:12:42 The fact is that no matter how you cut it... man made the pollution that makes your wife think the world is ending. Climate change is real. The oil industry is to blame because they hid the information until it was almost too late to act.
2107 2018-08-24 19:12:41 You know who is well known for fringe theories devoid of facts and detached from reality? Climate change denialists fronted by oil company money, that's who.

I suggest everyone report this ad for targeted harassment.
2108 2018-08-24 19:12:29 Fuck, I need an oil change in the worst way

2110 2018-08-24 19:12:21 What does this govt want to use to take our dependence away from oil? Bcs there are no policies directed at encouraging exportation of any sort.

2116 2018-08-24 19:11:45 @jamesmartinchef No,no,no, you DO NOT cook with #oliveoil traditionally used as an anointing oil - the molecular structure changes when heated - it's not good.

2120 2018-08-24 19:11:23 It has zero to do with individuals, I already drive a Smart car. It has to do with government policy. We cannot leave oil as individuals.  We must be forced off as a group, all of us.
2121 2018-08-24 19:11:16 What do you do when you have anxiety?

Oil?

Or something else?
2122 2018-08-24 19:11:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

2137 2018-08-24 19:09:32 Try rubbing some #cbd #hemp oil on it to help with muscle relaxation and stress relief
2138 2018-08-24 19:09:20 Put vitamin E oil on it, or just keep your favorite lotion with you and reapply it every hour or so.
2139 2018-08-24 19:09:08 I've been having a low key anxiety attack since I woke up and now i'm at the shop getting my car's oil changed and oddly really relaxed? Is this a secret sign that I need to drop everything and go into the automobile business.
2140 2018-08-24 19:08:51 It has nothing to do with oil please.

 Use a good lip balm or oil daily to keep them hydrated 
 Try lip masks in the morning or night 
 Use a lip gloss/ lip tint to enhance the shine and make your lips look hydrated and plump
2147 2018-08-24 19:08:12 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

2151 2018-08-24 19:08:03 Have you noticed coal quality has an impact on this dynamic? Say anthracite in South Wales vs. bituminous coal in the Midlands. Thinking about the way oil quality is the factor that makes Alberta a periphery oil producer imo.

2164 2018-08-24 19:06:28 Oil subsidies is a fallacy, they do not get any breaks that are not available to any other sector.
2165 2018-08-24 19:06:25 Balsamic vinegar, Balsamic vinaigrette, and other vinegars are vastly different in taste. Balsamic vinaigrette is also an emulsion of Balsamic vinegar, oil, mustard, honey, and seasonings.

Subbing one for another is like subbing ketchup for ranch in a recipe.

2180 2018-08-24 19:05:13 The real question is do you use coconut oil on your hair??
2181 2018-08-24 19:05:10 CBD Oil!
2182 2018-08-24 19:05:10 Baby oil is produced by squashing babies.   Two small wrinkly dogs can be held together with a bulldog clip.
2183 2018-08-24 19:05:06 Johnson’s baby oil gel is my favorite purchase of the year and I’ll probably use it until I die
2184 2018-08-24 19:05:03 It totally is one. Coconut Oil is super healthy. Sad
2185 2018-08-24 19:04:59 you will find allies. but they are liabilities in Asia the rich are theUSA allies, you can have the poor wanting cheap oil or credit on it, African again half are with the USA the poor are liabilities so good luck with that.

2188 2018-08-24 19:04:43 They don't use low price of oil anymore , because they know that the amount of a barrel is 2 times higher than the budgeted figure. Only quoroption is on the table.

2190 2018-08-24 19:04:10 U.S. oil futures climb more than 5% for the week
2191 2018-08-24 19:04:09 That's a different issue. Our resources should never have been sold. They belong to us and the profits should enure to future generations of Canadians, not to transnational oil baron corporations.

2196 2018-08-24 19:03:40 Oil. Venezuela drowns in oil while their people starve.
2197 2018-08-24 19:03:37 Poor? But they have the biggest proven oil reserves on the planet about 20,000 more barrels/day than the Saudi’s .. something’s gone wrong somewhere...

2200 2018-08-24 19:03:28 She never said "this"
But, the breaking of the arctic ice is just the tip of the iceberg. It all is interwoven with dozens of other climate change effects that have YES...killed thousands. Stop watching FOX or listening to Republicns that have accepted money from the oil industry

2205 2018-08-24 19:02:20 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
2206 2018-08-24 19:02:08 — Tips
 Use a lip balm with SPF to avoid burning your lips
 Use an oil based lip scrub to add hydration while exfoliating 
 Avoid licking your lips because it actually dries them out
 Keep your body (and lips) hydrated by drinking plenty of water
2207 2018-08-24 19:02:04 What kind of lunatic cheers for Capitalism? Especially Oil companies! Yay we are destroying all the planet’s resources at any amazing pace and with great efficiency! And a small no of investors are getting rich.

2209 2018-08-24 19:01:49 Every time I go to JiffyLube they say “hey, looks like your car’s got an oil leak” and I try so hard not to say “oh so that’s why it belches smoke every time I stop”
2210 2018-08-24 19:01:42 An oil barrel (bbl) is 42 gallons.
2211 2018-08-24 19:01:33 Perhaps oil money? Perhaps spitefulness?

2246 2018-08-24 18:59:37 Beautiful
2247 2018-08-24 18:59:36 Please also raise awareness of the ban on hydraulic fracturing and the economic benefits Nova Scotia, New Brunswick Quebec and Newfoundland are missing out on, oil and gas should be a federal issue. Not provincial.
2248 2018-08-24 18:59:32 No. I advocate buying our oil from free and democratic nations such as our own, instead of Islamic totalitarian regimes that execute women for disagreeing with them and are known sponsors of terror.
2249 2018-08-24 18:59:29 Same mine turns into a sweaty gym oil slick then dry ends like combo
2250 2018-08-24 18:59:22 well....From Jan 1973 through Aug 1974 — a period that includes the conviction of the Watergate burglars, Nixon’s resignation, global oil shock, Middle East turmoil, and a dramatic spike in inflation — stocks lost 42% of their value.... so maybe nbc and cnn will get back to news

2252 2018-08-24 18:59:17 I definitely know the feeling for sure! I’m having a break from anxiety right now ( thanks to CBD oil ) but my depression & stress level is pretty high right now!
2253 2018-08-24 18:59:01 Why would they waste so much money on expanding Aberdeen Harbour when every one knows the oil will run out immediately NS announces ScotIndyRef2
2254 2018-08-24 18:58:59 How do people cook shirtless????? That oil popped me on the chest & I screamed in falsetto 
2255 2018-08-24 18:58:59 Take the day off. My bad. Purple bottle. It’s water and oil based
2256 2018-08-24 18:58:58 You said it,..How to improve the sales of Olive oil,  tell the world that Coconut oil is poison and ban it's entry in US.  Indians in US have no choice
2257 2018-08-24 18:58:51 I’m not feeling today at oil
2258 2018-08-24 18:58:14 Me he ido al shale gas directo. Hablabas de shale oil, cierto.
2259 2018-08-24 18:58:11 U.S. Rig Count is down 13 rigs from last week to 1,044, with oil rigs down 9 to 860, gas rigs down 4 to 182, and miscellaneous rigs unchanged at 2.
2260 2018-08-24 18:58:11 I’m just wondering what sort of lies I should spread in service to the tin man. To start with, I’ll spread rumors that oil is good and water is bad.
2261 2018-08-24 18:57:58 Canceling the pipeline won’t cause people to stop burning oil.

Nobody has a more efficient/safer proposal to get the oil to market.

There is too much pushback on existing targets. Nobody can stay in power to implement stronger ones at the moment. Change them later.
2262 2018-08-24 18:57:57 Hi Art, Please help me understand is the increase in Gas vs actual Oil . What am I missing ? Thank you , best, jerry, Mundiregina  Resources e
2263 2018-08-24 18:57:45 I have to disagree. Ignoring them has allowed them to work behind the scenes via Alex Jones and other right wing carnival barking snake oil salesman to brainwash the average uneducated american into thinking they have the shit end of the stick and thats its the democrats fault.
2264 2018-08-24 18:57:31 So you are telling us you lied when you said we didn't need to worry about NK and the Nuc's, that you failed. News Flash we knew you would. You are not a deal maker you are a snake oil salesman.
2265 2018-08-24 18:57:27 My salt pig! Also glass carafe for olive oil.
2266 2018-08-24 18:56:49 @gmbutts is apparently worth over $20m. According to his Wikipedia resume, the only source of that would be the salary from the WWF. Or he is one helluva investor and if so he’s in the wrong job. Seems that working as a senior ENGO member makes you RICH! Who needs oil subsidies?
2267 2018-08-24 18:56:49 Alberta is a province where a left wing government implements free-market based policies (carbon tax, renewable energy contracts) while the RW opposition suggests more govt involvement (shipping oil east, GSA tattling, etc..)

What's a political spectrum? #ableg #ucp #abndp
2268 2018-08-24 18:56:46 Argan oil = perfect hair results @melisagaribay17
2269 2018-08-24 18:56:36 Not reasonable. You aren't considering the practicalities- how closure of oil production NOW-tomorrow- impacts individual workers. Job today, none tomorrow. Who pays mortgage this month, next, where do I go, who will buy my house if I have to move elsewhere?
2270 2018-08-24 18:56:09 Oil Don dry ooh... Make no go knock go n buy 200 Naira oil sharp shape oya
2271 2018-08-24 18:56:02 That probably wouldn't even be that hard to do, as the ingredients are simple and can be stored dry other than water/oil.
2272 2018-08-24 18:56:00 @CaspianReport can you explain why the West supports some and opposes other countries in the middle east? Because it's clear that it has nothing to do with which countries have better/worse human rights, but it's clearly not all about oil either...
2273 2018-08-24 18:55:42 How much oil does Brunei produce?
2274 2018-08-24 18:55:38 I definitely need to do a nice hot oil treatment this weekend on my hair

@Ocasio2018 and @SenSanders are clowns!

#Venezuela is shipping refugees rather than oil.
2278 2018-08-24 18:55:12 Never said the experiences are fake. But chronic Lyme, wifi sensitivity, mold illness, unsubstantiated heavy metals and “toxins” are generally scams and not the cause of people’s problems. The people in #Afflicted need to stop spending their money on quacks and snake oil.
2279 2018-08-24 18:55:06 Snake. Oil.
2280 2018-08-24 18:54:57 "Also, I'm not a Hunter. I'm a Titan. But yeah, Exos still get dirty. It just takes longer since we don't produce oil on our 'skin.'"
2281 2018-08-24 18:54:54 The tan is nice cause I can oil and polish out any scratches.
2282 2018-08-24 18:54:49 Math not a strong suit of yours is it 13 yrs from 05 but that’s fine. I and every other cityzen know the only way you “people” can sleep at night is by counting excuses..

2283 2018-08-24 18:54:37 Kim totally played the puppet and now has no probler getting oil and supplies from China and Russia. Are you going to piss off two of the largest world powers and start WW3 or are you going to put your suckie in your mouth and crawl back into your cradle?
2284 2018-08-24 18:54:32 There was an immediate financial impact.  The pound going from $1.50 to $1.30 increased the price of many imported goods - particularly oil which is priced in dollars, as well as many commodities.
2285 2018-08-24 18:54:32 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
2286 2018-08-24 18:54:28 And my pockets slimmer than olive oil lol
2287 2018-08-24 18:54:28 So you need a casserole pan. Coat it with oil so the stuff doesn’t stick. Tear up some bread for the bottom of the pan, Brown 1lb of breakfast sausage then put the cooked sausage into the pan with as much cheese as you like. Whisk 3-6 eggs with 1 cup milk then pour on top
2288 2018-08-24 18:54:21 When they've got all the oil, the gas, the wealth, the power and complete dominion over every living soul on this planet.

Makes them sound almost evil, doesn't it.
2289 2018-08-24 18:54:17 I hope the winners get an actual barrel of oil
2290 2018-08-24 18:54:17 Every meal I make nowadays I think “This might not be the same after Brexit”. Steak for supper tonight. Lovely olive oil.
2291 2018-08-24 18:54:11 We don't live in a democracy. It's a FPTP system that Trudeau promised he'd abolish because it's undemocratic. He's owned by same corporate interests that prevents Canada from living in a democracy. He just bought an oil pipeline for his buddies at Kinder Morgan.

2296 2018-08-24 18:53:08 Sisi bathi coconut oil!
2297 2018-08-24 18:53:01 You're forgetting all the various ancillary businesses- transportation, equipment manufacturers etc. Lots of companies involved, not just oil producers.
2298 2018-08-24 18:53:01 Fries with ketchup! Sacrilege! MUST be with freshly homemade egg & oil mayonnaise! And add a nice juicy tenderloin steak to that to go please.... ;-)
2299 2018-08-24 18:53:00 Soufflés (or puffed) potatoes were unintentionally created in the 1800s when Collinet, French King Louis Phillipe's chef, plunged already fried potatoes into hot oil to reheat them. Surprisingly, and to the king’s delight, the spuds puffed up like little balloons. #FunFactFriday

2309 2018-08-24 18:52:19 People only care about Mollie Tibbett’s murder because it was done by an illegal immigrant. Haven’t heard a peep about the white man that strangled his wife and two young daughters then dumped them in a vat of old oil in Colorado.
2310 2018-08-24 18:52:17 Madam, you do understand, no doubt, that such reports are of studies to suit those companies which want people to shift to Olive Oil for business growths around the world.
And India is very big market!

In my family "cancer causing" mustard oil is our staple use...
2311 2018-08-24 18:51:49 1 lb peeled small onions or chopped onion
1lb peeled garlic
1 quart mixture of  olive oil, bslsamic vinegar  (or wine)
1tblspn of seasoning mix of coice. Mrs dash is good but I make my own.

Put in casserole dish, cook on slow oven(very low heat) until garlic smoothes easily.

2316 2018-08-24 18:51:14 Indeed. Without an amazingly oddly constructed diet (oil and sugar for example) protein is also quite interchangeable. 

This is why protein deficiency states are nearly universally caloric deficiencies as well.

2327 2018-08-24 18:49:27 He's not fussy, tbh. This was tuna in olive oil but he usually gets spring water. He's not allowed tuna in brine for the same reason he doesn't get to share me feta.

But someone always got somethin half woke to say without getting all the sleep out they eyes first.
2340 2018-08-24 18:48:24 Yay i got my oil change for free 
2341 2018-08-24 18:48:24 Normal people who haven't been subjected to voodoo snake oil salesmen recognise that vaccines save millions of lives but it seems we are in age when some prefer to remain ignorant and watch their children die. For all our sakes let's hope the age of ignorance passes quickly.
2342 2018-08-24 18:48:22 Use olive oil i do use it and is very good. Buy it from Saeed ghani. And use johnsons baby shampoo as it has low chemicals.
2343 2018-08-24 18:48:22 cbd oil is nice for you
2344 2018-08-24 18:48:15 When your a kid you can't wait to grow up and do all the fun adult stuff...

The sad fucking reality is I'm spending a Friday night rubbing mineral oil into my wooden kitchen worktops. Adulting sucks.
2345 2018-08-24 18:47:56 Drop the same through air through oil then water and mercury. Faster through air slower through oil but feather will be left on oil elephant will be suspended on mercury....
2346 2018-08-24 18:47:50 @jimrome Jim i finished changing my oil in my sled thanks to O'Reilly's 
Sure worked up a hunger wish i had a masterbuilt smoker!
2347 2018-08-24 18:47:42 There is more spit in this than olive oil ..
2348 2018-08-24 18:47:37 Is that the reason/justification for crude oil to be taken overseas and bought back expensively as a finished product?
2349 2018-08-24 18:47:22 Yes, back in Scotland 
2350 2018-08-24 18:47:21 i’ve been lowkey interested in CBD oil but have been too lazy to do research. what were some good resources for you?
2351 2018-08-24 18:47:21 Rosto was horrible! Extremely salty and dripping in oil :( Malo KFC
2352 2018-08-24 18:47:08 What it what kind of oil’s to You sell??
2353 2018-08-24 18:47:00 Across the varying spectra of people lie two extremes. Those who burn their plantain and those who sprinkle hot oil on their plantain.
2354 2018-08-24 18:46:52 Lord please protect me because I’m goin to a ghetto place that had good reviews on google for an oil change
2355 2018-08-24 18:46:51 Oh please...McCain and Integrity are as Oil and Water.

2359 2018-08-24 18:46:37 NK has played every president since Nixon. You're not going to get anything. They continue to build nuclear capabilities. China continues to sell oil, Russia continues to sell them uranium. There are so many ways around US sanctions!
Yeah, we know, you love dictators.
TRAITOR
2360 2018-08-24 18:46:32 Can We now finally quit burning toxic gasoline and fossil oil?
2361 2018-08-24 18:46:20 If we developed our oilfields then we could shut the door on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That country is a fiefdom and yet the world allows them to play both sides due to oil. Sad; isn’t it?
2362 2018-08-24 18:46:06 And man I do recall my dad trying to sell me on the “burn the midnight oil for 2 years, do whatever you want after” deal. Sounded all good on paper in boring rural Surrey, but those JEE prep school years in Mumbai were brutal. Had zero chill when I got to college.
2363 2018-08-24 18:45:57 Check your Engine oil this weekend.

2368 2018-08-24 18:45:08 ain’t nothing like saving $40 for an oil change when ya dad is a mechanic
2369 2018-08-24 18:45:06 Thank you, will look into it
2370 2018-08-24 18:44:55 Had a pretty alright dinner. Made a mushroom & leek sauce (with lots of garlic, capers, black pepper, olive oil, butter, chicken stock, dried mushroom stock, white wine, crème fraiche, Parmesan) and chucked in a load of Waitrose prosciutto & mortadella cappelletti. Friday, yeah?
2371 2018-08-24 18:44:50 Yeah, holy water and anointing oil can never be in your possession. You have already cooked some life rats with em
2372 2018-08-24 18:44:37 No term oil for the sessions?
2373 2018-08-24 18:44:31 I just got a free oil change and tire rotation. I’d like to think it was because I’m cute... really it was my RBF and the two hour wait. #ohwell #freeisfree #thankshonda
2374 2018-08-24 18:44:29 What about more forest fires in Northern Ontario & severe droughts & sudden floods in Toronto? Can we talk about how to prevent them? & why coal & oil are dead end jobs in a dead-end industry? Can we talk about the spread of Lyme disease north? Never said anything about climate.

2376 2018-08-24 18:44:19 The war on Yemen by saudia Arabia is to take over the strategic ports located on mouth of red sea bab al mandib port, thus all oil can freely be feeded to Israelis without fear in near future through neom, it's great game to control hejaz as well. Do more of your research
2377 2018-08-24 18:44:09 We don't seem to ever talk about anything serious. Having said that, most states don't even attract the income tax too.
Delta and Rivers state both successfully chased oil companies away from their states at the expense of the little PAYE.
Their loss is gain to Lagos.
2378 2018-08-24 18:44:04 Hey thanks guys ! I hope to see you this Sunday at Stockbridge market ???
2379 2018-08-24 18:44:02 Just forget about the "tighter buildings since the Arab oil embargo"
 Hard to believe such a ridiculous proposition got so much traction.
There were no shortage of water damaged buildings prior to 1970 to make this phenomenon MORE than evident.   But there is no record of it.

2385 2018-08-24 18:43:12 U can sometimes cook dinner in the time it takes @aspiegelnpr to finish a sentence. When I’m back at my computer I’ll send an audio sample. Also ask her abt the boiling oil.
2386 2018-08-24 18:43:09 If data is the new oil, and your data is breached, shouldn't we call it a data spill? #showerthoughts #bigdata #tech #hacking
2387 2018-08-24 18:43:09 the mechanic also tried to sell me extensive mileage oil ($20 more) even after I told him I only drive 2,000 miles a year. I work from home. He said "Yeh, surrreee.."  I only need oil changed 1 x year max but want to trust people doing it.
2388 2018-08-24 18:42:59 It's right behind the coconut oil frenzy and kale frenzy.
2389 2018-08-24 18:42:34 Shell heeft nog zeeën van tijd. De wereld heeft nog decennia behoefte aan gas (en olie). Kijk naar de winsten van energiebedrijven nu. Ontslagen bij Siemens, Enercon, SIF, miljardenwinsten bij de oil majors. Wordt een hele lange transitie.

2400 2018-08-24 18:41:23 I like to think of the Scottish as cousins too — with oil and mining resources 
2401 2018-08-24 18:41:10 The flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil.
2402 2018-08-24 18:41:01 Are they really direct beneficiaries as you have wrote. Because these days all natural resources you say "my property " for the case of oil you said my oil. How will they trust you in order to leave some land as you say.
2403 2018-08-24 18:40:55 Cheated on my oil change guy and he knew it so now im like give me the best oil ill pay whatever

2407 2018-08-24 18:40:31 Man I hate how oil and water don’t mix. Why can’t you be friends? How am I supposed to wash the damn pan?
2408 2018-08-24 18:40:31 I just had my first media class 

I walked in and there’s an oil diffuser, a Mickey Mouse figurine, a professor in a Disney shirt, and no one sitting in the front row.

2417 2018-08-24 18:39:54 In context it's still evil. It's a statement on the role of government. A right wing idea that government exists to oil the economy and we can scurry around like ants to service it.

Today Brexit is their path to a Dickensian utopia they have been longing for.
2418 2018-08-24 18:39:36 Whats going on in the north sea, is there 3 ships on fire, are we at war! Or is it the flares from the oil rigs.
2419 2018-08-24 18:39:29 ??? Las reservas de oil en Australia son enanas, lo que hay es bastante gas y mucha planta para LNG.
2420 2018-08-24 18:39:20 Yo man have you played XC1? I'm pretty sure the strongest of the "Swimming Oil" style armor sets was actually one of the best sets in the game, an Dunban could even get a skill that buffed his Agility (basically the most important stat in the game) a lot if he just had no armor.

2431 2018-08-24 18:38:00 who caused it is fingerpointing - thats line of arguing that Big Oil wants you to take. what causes it? CO2. What emits CO2? internal cumbustion engines. Tell people all beaches globally are going underwater full-time and we cannot stop this. People will then mobilize against CO2
2432 2018-08-24 18:38:00 If i break your heart na oil spillage.

2437 2018-08-24 18:37:42 Justice is happening and I have full confidence that despite these difficult times were facing, things will get better and hopefully the majority of America learns that it’s about voting for the right candidate and don’t fall for the bullshit snake oil sales people.
2438 2018-08-24 18:37:22 Olive oil lagayi ya canola
2439 2018-08-24 18:37:21 CBD oil is subtle, the only immediate reaction- is relief. Nothing like smoking weed/pot/cannabis. It’s non-psychoactive. No munchies. No ‘sleepy’ ‘loopy’ ‘paranoia’ it’s safer for your kidneys and liver then OTC like acetaminophen and ibuprofen..Google
2440 2018-08-24 18:36:52 I don’t believe in God because God doesn’t believe in me!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! The government could build hoverbuses if they wanted to, BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO!

2449 2018-08-24 18:35:38 Easy to cook.....
Just like you make your normal sauce but this time around you adding garden eggs....

Boil the garden eggs and blend or pound with the pepper (roughly type), then fry on a heated palm oil....add fish and the rest and it's done.

2463 2018-08-24 18:33:37 Thinking of you, I’m going to try cbd cannabis oil from health food suppliers as I’m hearing very positive things about it
2464 2018-08-24 18:33:34 Yea! Keep up the good work. We need you in the Senate protecting Cali from tRUMP efforts to allow oil drilling off the coast, clear cutting our forests, fracking, weaken air/water quality & gas mileage standards. A newbie w/no seniority can't do that.

2468 2018-08-24 18:33:06 I have no clue where the Oil finish in our division.

2475 2018-08-24 18:32:24 Very confident on this one Heid. Should see anything from 20p-50p plus depending on the flows of course. R1/2 and Mengo can do that itself.

2476 2018-08-24 18:32:15 My mama forever telling me to spray some oil sheen in my hair.
2477 2018-08-24 18:31:49 Your “oil money” is blood money. LFC said no. But hey, enjoy the child trafficking.
2478 2018-08-24 18:31:49 Having enough knowledge of the world oil market to realize I basically know f**k nothing of this torturous & often corrupt business I'd say Norway needs to do what Norway needs to do.
2479 2018-08-24 18:31:43 A year later, No. However, it's getting lighter.  I lather it in oil and make sure it's moisturised
2480 2018-08-24 18:31:35 Just market women that sells oil or liquid soap
2481 2018-08-24 18:31:33 You are probably what we N Indians call an "amirzada". Undergrad edu in the US costs an arm and a leg :)

Middle class boys like me had to slog the hard way and burn midnight oil to crack the JEE 
No life for 2 years.
2482 2018-08-24 18:31:25 Getting an oil change
2483 2018-08-24 18:31:21 Almost no industries should be dependent on government handouts, and those should only be for short-term special purposes.  The idiotic "Green Energy" movement would die immediately, oil and gas are practical and will continue just fine without government assistance
2484 2018-08-24 18:31:19 thankfully WSJ says opinion before posting such agenda and biased based writings. they just need to mention that they are a platform for biased and privileged folks with little experience on the ground and in the system. 

Oil money can go a long way to attract a pen.
2485 2018-08-24 18:31:12 the purpose is to only use oil as needed i never said oil or coal would disappear that is a stupid thought but its use will be  greatly reduced the more our science learns horse n buggies are not used very much are they
2486 2018-08-24 18:31:08 As a vegan, I'm laughing at the study showing coconut oil is dangerous. Um, it's a healthy oil like EVOO, especially compared to animal fats. Moderation is key.

2490 2018-08-24 18:30:49 En la diáspora venezolana en Estados Unidos, particularmente en Texas, hay mucho exiliado multimillonario (muchos trabajan en medicina y oil and gas). ¿Si ellos no se conmueven por sus compatriotas por qué habría de hacerlo uno? Conmovámonos por los niños de La Guajira y Chocó.
2491 2018-08-24 18:30:47 You are the piece of shit who fucked this all up in the first place. Which is it, not enough is being done for denuclearization (ALL on North Korea to show) or you stroking his cock with warmest regards and respect?? Just full of contradictions like any snake oil salesman!!!
2492 2018-08-24 18:30:45 Sambit patra (noun) meaning: A short and round object mostly seen on people's TV's, which makes a lot of noise when shaken. Especially when put in contact with any oil and natural gas.

2493 2018-08-24 18:30:44 Sen. Bryant is showing concern with the #MIMA bill, and said he would suggest using the BP Oil money to create an infrastructure fund for the state, this would then ensure the state have some oversight on the road projects the money goes to.. instead of the bill at hand #msleg
2494 2018-08-24 18:30:40 Dog how much should an oil change cost? I feel like I’m being jugged
2495 2018-08-24 18:30:14 @georgegalloway @talkradio the difference is that iraq and libya have oil, syria just has sand, by comparison :(
2496 2018-08-24 18:30:13 Congratulate him for breaking sanctions buying oil from Russia - both your pals stabbing you in the back. You’re a great judge of character. These guys played you like the sap you are. As you are so fond of saying - SAD!!!!!
2497 2018-08-24 18:29:59 Hootey and Rev || Tabletop sim (Aye, Dark Overlord and maybe Snake oil)
2498 2018-08-24 18:29:40 A Gemini had me dipping her freshly done braids in crisco oil, throwing eggs at her house and pouring cranberry juice all over her at 4 am on the ave & then when we finished fighting took a shower together and made up. Smh bitch had me tweaking 
2499 2018-08-24 18:29:38 My boyfriend keep telling me he gone get the oil changed in my car, but he taking too long. Now I’d be wrong if I went ahead & paid someone to do it wouldn’t I 
2500 2018-08-24 18:29:35 Went out to get my oil changed at a scheduled appointment...

Two hours and five errands later, I'm still not home and out running another errand.
2501 2018-08-24 18:29:33 @viantreston Just watched ur recent Q&A... oil based paints actually blend easily and don’t dry quickly, I think you mean acrylic paints, which dry faster and are harder to blend, so I guess the ink in splatoon is an acrylic ink that dries instantly
2502 2018-08-24 18:29:24 It never fails. I spray the birdfeeder poles with olive oil to keep the chipmunks off, then it rains and they're shimmying up the poles easy peasy.
2503 2018-08-24 18:29:21 An entire state of India, Kerala (among others) has used coconut oil as staple cooking oil for centuries. My grandparents wouldn't have lived to the age they did if coconut oil was "pure poison".
2504 2018-08-24 18:29:10 "I grew up running the streets" the amount of virgin oil in this tweet is gross
2505 2018-08-24 18:29:09 Righttttt! I just need a deep condition and hot oil treatment before I get some box braids or something
2506 2018-08-24 18:29:06 @pepboysauto huge shoutout to the team that changed my oil today at Osceola parkway! I drive all the way across town for the amazing service
2507 2018-08-24 18:29:03 coconut oil smells so bad
2508 2018-08-24 18:28:58 my engine be like: 5% oil life please change me mommy
2509 2018-08-24 18:28:57 What about drilling of oil that has been ok'd by this administration.  Want to know what you are doing about EPA? Are you telling me that every GOP doesn't care about our environment? One bill at a time nothing added to it.
2510 2018-08-24 18:28:39 were they refrigerating olive oil?
2511 2018-08-24 18:28:33 I think that he killed the girls and put them in the oil tanks so they could not get DNA off of their bodies to put doubt in so he will not get death. Because he would of just buied them with their mother if she really did kill them herself.
2512 2018-08-24 18:28:26 $RBIZ...one day you'll wish you had bought this in sub 6's. This company provides food to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), political and economic alliance of six Middle Eastern countries—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. Oil $$$
2513 2018-08-24 18:28:17 Confession of sin is never a thread to holiness, but is the oil that keeps sanctification smooth in humility for the soul has nothing to boast on.
2514 2018-08-24 18:28:07 Never knew about this rice thing. Apart from oil, we also import diamonds, polish and send them back. These are our two biggest exports. As oil prices rise, our exports will show a rise which is as misleading as one can imagine.
2515 2018-08-24 18:27:42 You could get sheet mask that have more essence or liquid in them? My skin care is pretty minimal but I realised a difference aft using thayer’s witch hazel toner. Skin is soother and oil controlled better
2516 2018-08-24 18:27:38 Just a guess but engineers, geophysicists and all others associated with the oil patch make a bit more money and pay slightly more taxes than someone making minimum wage in either tourism or the hospitality industry, so let's kill the great jobs to save the lousy ones
2517 2018-08-24 18:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
2518 2018-08-24 18:27:26 Own land to continue the oil pipe line; removing historic statues; Favor now nazis; instead of regular citizens; having ICE remove working hard immigrates (not criminals or rapist) like he said on the news. Etc.. etc.. etc..
2519 2018-08-24 18:27:16 My mother keep calling to tell me to check my oil & I can’t even lift the hood smh like I just gotta find somebody to do it
2520 2018-08-24 18:27:13 Watch out - if dogs get in the stuff, the oil can rub off on their coat & transfer when you pet them!
2521 2018-08-24 18:26:59 ..dismantling the DS from Congress, CIA, FBI, NSA, and all the alphabet agencies; cutting regs connected to stupid global arming initiative, opened possibilities for Us to be energy dependent (oil, nat. gas, coal), revived our industries (esp. coal, steel)...
2522 2018-08-24 18:26:41 So ayun, tinry ko yung castor oil sa noo ko baka sakaling humaba yung mga baby hair na nagtatago HAHAHAHA
2523 2018-08-24 18:26:39 Like olive oil virgin?
2524 2018-08-24 18:26:34 Deep Nutrition is one of the more eye opening health books I’ve read in the last couple of years; best breakdown of how different oils interact w our bodies at a cellular level (and I agree w it that coconut oil is fine vs. the multitude of heated vegetable oils)
2525 2018-08-24 18:26:28 Alberta, Sasky and NFLD are the only ones that even remotely understand the oil dollar.
2526 2018-08-24 18:26:21 The oil from Alberta is dirty. So much so the Chinese’s won’t process it anymore. As far as human rights go I’m sure you support the PM in his attack on Saudi human rights like I do.
2527 2018-08-24 18:26:18 ติดตาอะมึง กูเห็นภาพ แล้วมึงนอนยังไงนิ
2528 2018-08-24 18:26:11 to be honest if you and every dipper could stop using oil all together - we would still be mega rich any buying who or what we want
2529 2018-08-24 18:26:02 Use a mix of peppermint oil, lavender oil, and water and make a spray, in small amounts it helps keep bugs away and it adds a nice fresh scent!
2530 2018-08-24 18:25:51 Absolutely! Being stuck behind a diesel is disgusting, you can practically taste the oil. The sooner all diesel vehicles are gone the better!

2536 2018-08-24 18:25:17 well I hope your right. i have a 'few' 
2537 2018-08-24 18:25:15 Me too, I managed to down a chicken with chili sauce special and make some money on an oil short.  But still, nothing yet
2538 2018-08-24 18:25:09 It matters politically, in the US anyway.  The Republican Party continues to try to discredit climate science because if humans aren't the cause, that gives them an excuse to keep on putting more CO2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere.  Big oil contributes to Republicans.
2539 2018-08-24 18:24:49 And salt. And salt!! 
Man don't try to curve that little salt you'll just sprinkle on the oil.
2540 2018-08-24 18:24:44 My mom saved OxyContin from a surgery and take it one at a time when things get rough. Marijuana is legal in our state, but she’s afraid of using a topical oil for pain because “she might get addicted,” however. She’s 77
2541 2018-08-24 18:24:43 Who is in power in the US and Latin America, and how are the livelihoods of the indigenous tribes? Was their conquest altruistic? 

They'll probably be left alone until someone wants to turn their land into a palm oil farm, & then they'll become serfs to agribusiness.
2542 2018-08-24 18:24:40 They murdered the coal industry... 

How? By saying there were more efficient fuels like natural gas and oil,  or that there were more sustainable, clean, and secure fuels like solar wind and geothermal.
2543 2018-08-24 18:24:32 I only know that there was a spill on  a oil rig ya BP . that took ages to clean up
2544 2018-08-24 18:24:29 “Maybe bush helped 9/11 happened because it would help his dynasty of oil barons thrive at the expense of thousands of Americans lives”
2545 2018-08-24 18:24:19 Que bronca me da mi viejo con el gas oil, cuando es para trabajo me dice que me la pasó gastando, y cuando llega el finde me bajo un tanque dando vueltas y ni problema
2546 2018-08-24 18:24:06 Im hoping the price goes way way up ..then I’m going in for a MONSTER short oil longterm play..
2547 2018-08-24 18:24:01 @clydessb cant using the the dead phrase ...Celtic fans using these words needed flayed...these pricks make snide comments about the the rangers ..then fuck themselves up using oil farm ...fkn scum
2548 2018-08-24 18:23:42 Probably 15-20. It was only oil revenues that made us a contributor.
2549 2018-08-24 18:23:39 I don't want your snake oil. And I reject your lies.
Children belong with their parents. It's over a month and you are disobeying the orders of a judge

2552 2018-08-24 18:23:16 My coworker taught me to use the dull side of a toilet seat cover to wipe the excess oil off my face when I’m using a public bathroom and, honestly ladies, it’s a game-changer.

2556 2018-08-24 18:22:40 “ selling America’s foreign policy for oil”. 
Why - over the past 70 years who would ever have done that? I am shocked.  But wait. Whoever bought this deal can’t be happy with the unprecedented surge in US domestic energy production. Doesnt compute
2557 2018-08-24 18:22:37 well, all metals have to be mined, and plastics are from oil, so recycling the existing materials more efficiently seems to be the best option to me.

2559 2018-08-24 18:22:16 definitely wouldn't be cooking with that often. Butter or olive oil are far better choices. Although a variety is ultimately best.
2560 2018-08-24 18:22:13 Black is a mystery box for space travel.
Black is an oil instead of a desert green oasis ...
If it had not been for the blackness, a star would not have brightened, nor would Badr appear in heaven.
Black is the color of Bilal muezzin the best of the prophets.
2561 2018-08-24 18:21:59 Someone had to say it, BABY OIL IS MADE FROM BABIES! I'll probably end up dead because of this tweet

2564 2018-08-24 18:21:25 Right, well. Fair to say that Blair and I interpreted US and CDN oil products reports, spills in marine environment, risk and risk-assessments very differently.  When my work prioritized environmental protection, climate action and an inter-sectional analysis, I get trolled.
2565 2018-08-24 18:21:21 Cardinal O'Malley, either intentianally or accidently  began by saying "I accept responsibility." These three words should frame the beginning of every discussion on abuse by all those men anointed by Chrism Oil! If they cannot: career counselling is a must!

2570 2018-08-24 18:20:58 Interesting...I am very negative on Mexico and its crazy new President. This AMLO is going to make a mess and Mexico's oil production will just keep on falling.
2571 2018-08-24 18:20:31 You can wear makeup but it has to be oil free. I personally don’t recommend it unless you don’t mind spending the money to get them retouched more often but any sort of build up on the lashes will cause them to fall out quicker.

2578 2018-08-24 18:19:16 Oil industry actually employs very little people. For example in the US more people are employed in the solar industry then in the oil industry.

What the f**k is wrong with this country..

2591 2018-08-24 18:17:42 The GOP has protected big oil's interests over the environment for decades. That's why we're here now. It's called climate change! Believe it!
2592 2018-08-24 18:17:35 Because Iran aids the Houti rebels to have a foothold against Saudi Arabia, & if Iran won the whole region would become f'd up, millions might die in a full-scale war, and the price of oil might destroy the West's economy? ...I guess
2593 2018-08-24 18:17:25 Reading this thread with interest. I went to doc two weeks ago. Prescribed olive oil. Used twice a day since but....ear still blocked and ringing. Apparently there's a vacuum option too - which is best?

2606 2018-08-24 18:16:31 Very good unbiased report. I have used it on my skin, little cooking. I agree moderation is key for any oil.
2607 2018-08-24 18:16:31 There's still oil derricks all over the place if you know where to look. A lot of them have been removed in the last 70 or so years, but if you read Raymond Chandler he mentions them a lot.
2608 2018-08-24 18:16:30 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2609 2018-08-24 18:16:08 Oil n Gas? Hahahahahah

2613 2018-08-24 18:15:45 The southern oil rich city of Basra, Iraq is facing a health epidemic, large number of people have been effected by unsanitary water.

2614 2018-08-24 18:15:43 She should remember Idi Amin still existed...and it was so bad for the ruthless thug he is today buried in a foreign land! Kubanga this world knows how to keep balance.
2615 2018-08-24 18:15:38 ty for the help! will look in2 argan oil
2616 2018-08-24 18:15:34 We extract it from sun-dried coconuts. After oil is extracted in a mill it's again sundried.
2617 2018-08-24 18:15:25 I only came to get an oil change!!! No extras! Finish my car so I can be out.
2618 2018-08-24 18:15:22 How can we rely on an #oil industry so frail, weak, vulnerable, & constantly needing government handouts? #TexasPanhandlers
2619 2018-08-24 18:15:20 Do you keep anything special for frying or just go pot with oil? I’m simple like that, but don’t fry much
2620 2018-08-24 18:15:17 Yang or Blake
2621 2018-08-24 18:15:12 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
2622 2018-08-24 18:15:05 i have to go get my oil changed today by myself since my mom backed out of going with me for it too so i’m gonna wall in there like “can i by chance purchase an Oil”
2623 2018-08-24 18:15:05 Sort of like castor oil
2624 2018-08-24 18:14:47 she gets the moroccan argan oil brand serum stuff that u can find at the grocery usually! i also think she doesnt use shampoo just conditioner bc whenever i ask to borrow shes like u fool. i dont own that
2625 2018-08-24 18:14:45 Happening in the Uk 
Dr Taylor: Joud, do you have oil in Jordan?
Joud: Nop
Dr Taylor: ahaaa, that’s probably why you don’t have problems in Jordan.

2626 2018-08-24 18:14:45 Farmers use the owl decoys, airports use them, resort hotels use them to frighten seagulls. Chevron Oil company put owl decoys on their buildings at the San Ramon campus to stop pigeons from shitting on the side of buildings.
2627 2018-08-24 18:14:42 thats ok!! its super easy bc u dont need a mixer or anything! just ur hands for kneading and stretching! all u basically need (including crust), is flour sugar water yeast oil sauce and cheese!
2628 2018-08-24 18:14:41 Those voting for Ted Cruz are misguided and do not have the cognizance to realize a snake oil salesman when presented with actual reality and fact.

2630 2018-08-24 18:14:30 Why have you jumped from a toxic vans slogan regarding immigration to oil on the clyde?
2631 2018-08-24 18:14:27 It seems to me that this coconut oil research was not Harvard but Heyward research!!!!
2632 2018-08-24 18:14:21 I’m adulting today. 

I mean, I am every day, but today I’m getting my car an oil change. 

You know people put off that shit all the time.
2633 2018-08-24 18:14:18 james paid for my oil change
2634 2018-08-24 18:14:18 "a lot of waste veggie oil" is relative. It is insignificant in the context of the transportation industry energy needs. But yes, burn it for energy rather than dump it for sure. The only scalable solutions are solar and wind (and nuclear). Crop farming for energy is wasteful.
2635 2018-08-24 18:14:02 The adjustment on Fuel prices by the Energy Regulatory Commission is ill advised and a wrong moveThe gov should instead reduce corruption to Zero and observe austerity measures.we have our own Crude oil the bear pain at the pump? Not logic

2636 2018-08-24 18:13:59 OUR warmongering politicians?  More accurately our warmongering oil businessmen, but lets face it: Iran is really Persia, and Persia has been at war with anybody who'll fight them since Biblical times.  They rarely NEED "mongering" to get a war going.
2637 2018-08-24 18:13:50 Refined peanut oil has had the proteins completely removed- to the point that FDA doesn't require it to be labeled as an allergen. Roasted peanut oil has not been highly refined and contains proteins, so is allergenic. Cold-pressed oil also contains the proteins and is allergenic
2638 2018-08-24 18:13:39 ooo does she just apply pure oil 2 her hair?
2639 2018-08-24 18:13:29 $celz I guess thats why our ARCO gas price is at 2.69 . The oil sands are generating a lot of revenue for the people living there.
2640 2018-08-24 18:13:27 shading, contouring, makeup, angle, tanning, oil, lighting, fillers and more... a combination of all of these things can make a butter head look like a goddess.
2641 2018-08-24 18:13:18 Coconut oil has completely solidified. Autumn is coming lads
2642 2018-08-24 18:13:15 White people who put oil on and then burn just to tan terrify me.
2643 2018-08-24 18:13:12 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
2644 2018-08-24 18:13:03 Well let’s see was short oil at $69.20 and damn thing just wouldn’t fade..had to leave for work at 11:20 central time so had to shut down software. I cover for a few tick gain..and it just dies this afternoon. That sums up my last few weeks of trading 
2645 2018-08-24 18:12:39 I don't get why people act like the Bulletproof Diet is crazy. Coconut oil and butter in your coffee isn't anything new to me. I put at least 5 cups of melted butter into my coffee every morning and I'm doing great.
2646 2018-08-24 18:12:26 methinks the extra virgin olive oil doth protest too much

2651 2018-08-24 18:11:30 I want a job in an oil company please follow me, lemme dm you as a new homie.
2652 2018-08-24 18:11:25 75% is ridiculous. need to basically take shots of olive oil between meals to hit that. Im having a lot of success on steaks, seafood, eggs, 65/30/5 -ish. Especially if you lift weights you need sufficient protein, 150-200g to build muscle
2653 2018-08-24 18:11:25 Etude Glow On oil volume ค่าา
2654 2018-08-24 18:11:25 Yes! Right!? I just learned there's an oil derrick in the parking garage of the Beverly Center and that cement factory still wins.
2655 2018-08-24 18:11:19 That is basically what Michelle obama said and Soros spent a lot of time in the White House! In fact during the gulf oil platform explosion Soros met with obama a dozen times then invested millions in Petrobras shares followed by obama sending billions there for offshore drilling

2658 2018-08-24 18:11:07 i just spilled a bunch of olive oil but i just used it as a moisturizer so honestly im thriving
2659 2018-08-24 18:10:57 Start by frying an onion in a little bit of olive oil in a saucepan. Add chicken (or Quorn, or similar). Then add tinned tomatoes (tomato puree and water for a cheaper version, passata for a fancy version). Add loads of veg (frozen is cheap), let it cook, add pepper, spices etc
2660 2018-08-24 18:10:29 OK, so that's 15 times out of 50 during the oil boom years. I wonder what the last 100 years looks like?.
2661 2018-08-24 18:10:25 With an nod he prepares a special marinade for the steaks so they can soak before its time to cook. The potatoes get a good scrubbing and a light coating of olive oil and salt. "Hopefully you will enjoy it."

2665 2018-08-24 18:10:07 The key is peanut oil and Cajun spice rubs...or a good bribe the night before. By far my favorite holiday food!

2671 2018-08-24 18:09:05 if you wanna wait over a year and till you’re over 10,000 miles to get an oil change then by all means go for it, but don’t come back to your dealership when they told you not to

2673 2018-08-24 18:08:50 The question now is, when will the residents resort to pouring hot oil on the pleebs bellow?
2674 2018-08-24 18:08:47 Nah. It's likely the oil pickup is oriented backwards from its original design. A deeper oil pan or running a few more quarts could have prevented it but that's what happens when you're a pioneer on a platform.

2680 2018-08-24 18:08:17 Lets be serious. Coconut oil is not meant to be heated. It can oxidize fairly quickly & turn into trans fats. It doesnt have much of a nutritional value.
2681 2018-08-24 18:08:13 Holes in your shoes are fashionable now, and cabbage juice and cod liver oil is very probably a drink you can order in some poncey gastropub.

2684 2018-08-24 18:07:31 A huge problem with tech right now is that we are back to the 60's paradigm of a small "priesthood" of those who actually understand tech and a wide population that has no clue whatsoever.  It makes for a dangerous environment where snake oil and those who sell it have control.

2698 2018-08-24 18:05:51 I should have been more specific. Both Robbie and Suzanne claimed the pipeline would stop dependency on Saudi oil. Downthread, I also spoke with Robin and Tina from the counter protest, who brought up the points you're referring to in this piece.

God had to remind me to be thankful I had the money for and oil change vs complaining about having to get it

2703 2018-08-24 18:05:37 my question is, where did you drop the oil?
2704 2018-08-24 18:05:33 Oh I see - a bit like the secret oil fields on the Clyde then. . Where on earth do you get your information from?
2705 2018-08-24 18:05:29 I’ve changed my oil a few times.....I pay $50 and don’t bat an eye.

2720 2018-08-24 18:04:17 Fried food isn't super healthy, but there's a lot of waste veggie oil.  Biodiesel is easier to produce than ethanol and requires no modifications in most engines.  It's not perfect, but a good part of a path off of fossil fuel.  Just put it in the tank and let's talk trolleybus.
2721 2018-08-24 18:04:12 Who tf are you lmao? Arabia is the center of backwards tribesmen and people who eat with their feet and smell . All the oil money and you still feel inferior to us culturally lol
2722 2018-08-24 18:03:46 When all of you burn everything commercially manmade, cars, phones, clothes, food, computers, etc.  Then you might have a leg to stand on.  All of that requires oil in some respect.
2723 2018-08-24 18:03:42 I guess I’ll change my own oil next time
2724 2018-08-24 18:03:13 PCs cut taxes to the tune of hundreds of million in revenue for NL and ran a deficit when oil was $100, increased the budget 33% over 10 years - good luck running as a fiscal conservative with your parties baggage

2730 2018-08-24 18:02:36 Crude Oil is mined in Turkana, taken overseas to be refined and then imported again to be used as a finished product! We had(have) Changamwe Oil Refinery, don't you think a serious government would have prioritized its revival so that we can refine the Crude oil in Kenya??

2740 2018-08-24 18:01:22 changin oil take a brick, i thought that shit jus fall out and they refill it smh why dat take 5ever
2741 2018-08-24 18:01:19 Mhmm. Def sounded like if it drives fine then nothing needs to be fixed and that there was no need to check on it but since you supposed to get an oil change that’ll be the only time you’ll check on your car.
2742 2018-08-24 18:01:08 Alovera pulp+lemon Juice+coconut oil(few drops)
Apply to roots and let it dry and wash. 
Have some Vitamin E acpsule a day.
2743 2018-08-24 18:01:08 Exfoliation is fine. Witch Hazel is awesome too. Or tea tree oil. Apple cider vinegar. I have a full list of options.
2744 2018-08-24 18:01:04 Do you need Crude Oil, Trump.?
2745 2018-08-24 18:00:39 I wish her a quick recovery
2746 2018-08-24 18:00:32 The best way to protect yourself from #mosquitoes is to apply #EPA registered insect repellents such as those containing #DEET, #picaridin, oil of #lemoneucalyptus, and #IR3535.
2747 2018-08-24 18:00:28 I’ve just been using castor oil on my scalp. I feel like people swear by biotin.
2748 2018-08-24 18:00:23 Oil
2749 2018-08-24 18:00:18 An oil pipeline that will never pump oil?
2750 2018-08-24 18:00:13 @realDonaldTrump is a huge failure!  He is a liar, fraud and criminal. He’s no deal maker . The only deals he made was paying people off, suing them or cheating them. Now he has conned the American people.  He’s a snake oil salesman, and can’t believe how gullible people are.
2751 2018-08-24 18:00:11 Gassing up next to a Jiffy Lube that is getting absolutely lit listening to some Skrillex in their garage. Might bring my car in for an oil change just to be part of it

2755 2018-08-24 18:00:02 Also, 100% of the oil associated with Nigeria is in Biafra, but Britain imposed the desert islamists on Biafra as government, using them to devastate Biafra thru exploration, and excluding Biafra from the benefit of the oil. Biafra is in total ruins by deliberate British sadism.
2756 2018-08-24 17:59:56 Hardest pill to swallow: those really big fish oil ones
2757 2018-08-24 17:59:36 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
2758 2018-08-24 17:59:36 Because for 2+ million years CO2 naturally fluctuated around 285ppm, it was only when humans dug up and burned carbon fuels (coal oil gas) that new CO2 was added to the system; we’re now at 410ppm. 

Simple physical science: burn fossil fuel = more CO2 = warmer = global warming.
2759 2018-08-24 17:59:31 Damn near touched a ticket off the oil i put that on my soul
2760 2018-08-24 17:58:56 The joy I felt when I found one could oil chassis fans!
2761 2018-08-24 17:58:49 Such a sham. Not surprisingly at all. Meyer has been a snake oil salesman whenever he has gone.
2762 2018-08-24 17:58:39 Regardless where do you think that CBD oil comes from....

2765 2018-08-24 17:58:07 I'm taking an extra suitcase on holiday specifically for Parmesan and olive oil! 
2766 2018-08-24 17:58:04 What information is that, exactly? That the pipeline is a good deal that's worth $9B - $10 B? I don't doubt that there are take or pay contracts, I'm just not dumb enough to believe they won't be walked on in the event of an oil crash.
2767 2018-08-24 17:57:56 Oil change & new tires smh
2768 2018-08-24 17:57:53 Why don't we utilize the plenty within our boarders to cub the rise of fuel prices? Turkana oil should significantly improve the lives of Kenyans. KOTTU Sec General Hon @FrancisAtwoli, is this possible?

2771 2018-08-24 17:57:30 It’s probable, with the exception of self defense that every murder can be prevented. Chris Watts didn’t have to strangle his pregnant wife, kill his 2 daughters and hide their bodies in barrels of oil.
2772 2018-08-24 17:57:28 ....of intellectual property. Japan was doing all these things until we placed the oil embargo for their aggressive militarily action in the region. China will challenge us soon. Xi Zing pin is a megalomaniac bent on power and will not stop
2773 2018-08-24 17:57:27 That it isn't a problem as of right now but it'll get checked when I get my first oil change

2779 2018-08-24 17:56:51 Lol did you miss my tweet where I said that I know all that gets checked when you get an oil change and that I'm planning to get one soon? I didn't mean it like I don't care about all that if thr car drives well. Just that I havent had it long and it was brand new so its likely
2780 2018-08-24 17:56:42 You're from the Palm Oil generation eeh? Isee
2781 2018-08-24 17:56:10 I was a responsible adult and for an oil change in my car.
2782 2018-08-24 17:55:50 I was astonished to read that Norway doesn't have a classification "Unknown Origin" for either its oil or gas accounts like #DarkMoney UK has. Every single barrel pumped directly onto ships is accounted for in Norway's North Sea export books.
2783 2018-08-24 17:55:48 Never thought getting a oil change would take so damn long
2784 2018-08-24 17:55:40 Got a brick for the pregnant mother and two daughters strangled and thrown in an oil vat by white American father? Didn't think so. What a ghoul, politicizing the death of this young women and fund-raising.
2785 2018-08-24 17:55:33 Toro lawn mower recycler self propelled

Self propelled, brand new rear bag.
New air filter, new spark plug, oil changed.

2786 2018-08-24 17:55:26 I don't know that it's the companies investment to make - the country / state should. Take London as an example - it all went through parliament. Infrastructure is firmly in the government's scope, but here it seems they'd rather support oil/gas companies and keeps cars on road.

2788 2018-08-24 17:54:54 Fascist hyper normalisation hr on @LBC. WHAT A SURPRISE. Should the uk not have intervened in spain in the 30's? Did they not have enough oil/goodies for the parasite class? The tory government of the time didn't want to. We all know what happened across europe at the time.

2791 2018-08-24 17:54:06 What did we learn Tyler? Before you put a car on a race track, make sure you have proper measures in place to prevent oil starvation! Between the astronomical repair costs of Barney, your Ferrari going up in smoke, and the Russian Bear; you may have to pair down the hooptie fleet
2792 2018-08-24 17:54:06 Since decades or even century now we’re eliminated like curbs to serve the masters f***g thirst of oil, pedophilia & $: we’re more than them we can defeat them we have to educate around to eliminate them, Yes together we can my sister
2793 2018-08-24 17:53:53 Baker Hughes Rig Count: U.S. -13 to 1,044 rigs

U.S. Rig Count is down 13 rigs from last week to 1,044, with oil rigs down 9 to 860, gas rigs down 4 to 182, and miscellaneous rigs unchanged at 2.
2794 2018-08-24 17:53:45 This was how crude oil pipeline vandalization started.

Folks all fired up then interest falls away & you then come across the ego issues in the management that often is the downfall with failing #BiD's along with failed delivery goals & promises.

2804 2018-08-24 17:51:47 @IcelandFoods . Your Willerby branch has marked its cauliflower rice as a free food @SlimmingWorld . I’ve just checked as it contains oil. It has to be synned!
2805 2018-08-24 17:51:43 I’m mormon and I support Prop 2! My dad has to take terrible pain killers and he needs this. I’m currently taking CBD oil. If the church doesn’t want this, then why don’t they come up with their own legislation instead of complaining all day and telling us what to vote on?
2806 2018-08-24 17:51:23 Got my oil changed and they told me I would need a new cabin filter and that it would be 40 dollars. 

That’s funny because it takes less than 5 minutes to put in and I ordered one on amazon for 14 dollars 
2807 2018-08-24 17:51:19 Don't believe everything that is written on this website. Coconut oil isn't that good for you.
2808 2018-08-24 17:51:14 Foreign oil companies did this propaganda for mustard oil. Google mustard oil benefits by scientist..it has best ratio of fatty acids
2809 2018-08-24 17:51:12 I once got an 8 ft wooden stepladder at the dump. I had this idyllic vision of pole greens growing up it. A week after I planted the seeds I left to go work on the oil spill and I didn’t come back for 8 months. It might have been exactly like my vision, but I never saw it.

2813 2018-08-24 17:50:28 Several of the sweets listed ingredients contain Palm oil. Unless it says 'Sustainable Palm', then these products are linked to the terrible deforestation of the Rain forest.
2814 2018-08-24 17:50:28 My car smokes a lot of oil and doesn't have dreads.
2815 2018-08-24 17:50:06 Last time I got an oil change, I listened to a guy complain to his friend, via cell phone (could have been himself), that it wasn’t fair the Beyoncé not only had a singing career but was also the host of AGT (America’s Got Talent). I blurted out, “That’s Tyra Banks”

2856 2018-08-24 17:46:18 That is a weak view, and omits that this is abt stopping EXPANSION of the oil sands, not use of oil. We do have choices. We need to act now or our kids will have a dim future...

2875 2018-08-24 17:44:35 I used to work for a car insurance company and a Camry will run forever if you do basic maintenance like keep the oil changed. Also if something breaks or goes wrong, parts are cheap and readily available for them. Fuel efficient. This goes for most Toyota models.
2876 2018-08-24 17:44:13 What's wrong with grouping myself with VIPs & diplomats? Pathology recognises pathology and successful guys band together no matter race, gender or sexuality.

2884 2018-08-24 17:43:20 Honestly, they could call it “I can’t believe it’s not mayonnaise” and I’d be just fine with it. It’s the evangelical, ambush-type nature of veganism that I’m really done with. It’s not enough for them to eat their weird oil sauce, they DEMAND that  you eat it too. Fuck that.
2885 2018-08-24 17:43:00 Britain is doing that to intimidate Biafrans from asking for their freedom so that they can tenaciously hold on to the confiscated Biafran wealth (OIL AND GAS), using their proxy, the Nigerian government.

2897 2018-08-24 17:41:23 @Harvard Karin Michels a epidemiologist & professor at Harvard university claims coconut oil is “pure poison.” Dr. Michels, is breast milk a poison?

2914 2018-08-24 17:39:34 The older your car is, the more frequently you should check the oil level in the engine. If the oil level is dropping faster than you think it should be, bring it in for an inspection, as it may be a sign of a greater problem. Most problems, if addressed early, can be quickly...

But do really think the whole city wouldn't revolt if some rich oil magnate came in and said he's going to move the team to Boston because he liked clam chowder?

Precourt isn't making a business decision.

SKC proved that you shouldn't move.

2926 2018-08-24 17:38:30 Was going to say the same thing, even in our RV we have keep a oil filled radiator heater on (also keeps the furnace from turning on and off too much)
2927 2018-08-24 17:38:30 Just be out front with it. This is a product of the Oil and Gas industry. You don't want us to hit your bottom-line.
2928 2018-08-24 17:38:29 They thought Big Oil referred to an industry until they saw my forehead in August.

2934 2018-08-24 17:37:39 So I dropped my car off to get the oil changed today. Shook the guy’s hand and thanked him. Afterwards he says “I was just reaching for your keys.”  ok. I’ll just go home now.

Credentials or not, it’s a concerted effort at studying the oil and the whole food that is needed to make better determinations on its health or lack of healthful benefits. Should also look at countries who’ve historically used it

3000 2018-08-24 17:30:49 $PED playing oil here.
3001 2018-08-24 17:30:45 Baker Hughes BHGE, +1.02% on Friday reported that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil fell 9 to 860 this week. The oil-rig count was unchanged last week. The total active U.S. rig count, which includes oil and natural-gas rigs, fell by 13 to 1,044, according to BH.
3002 2018-08-24 17:30:45 Money/payoffs from Rosneft oil deal?
3003 2018-08-24 17:30:42 @AmbJohnBolton America's control over Iraq's oil controls global decision and forces China and Russia to submit to America
3004 2018-08-24 17:30:29 @SecPompeo America's control over Iraq's oil controls global decision and forces China and Russia to submit to America
3005 2018-08-24 17:30:29 انا اشوف ان كل شخص حر في كيفية صرف أمواله دامها تصرف على نفسه أو رفاهيته أو في سبيل الله تعالى لأوجه الخير.... كلامهم لن يقدم لكم ولن يؤخر. أما الاستهزاء بهم فلا يجوز يعني ببساطة انت الان وغيرك المستهزيئ أخذت سيئاتهم وطرحت حسناتك؟!!!!
3006 2018-08-24 17:30:27 India exports oil??
3007 2018-08-24 17:30:20 US citizens buy everything coming from Venezuela. Oil, cocaine, money. What can be expected?

3013 2018-08-24 17:30:04 Today the news has told me.. 

-Alcohol will kill me.
-Low carb diets will slash 4 years of my life.
-Coconut oil is pure poison 

In other news, we are all gonna die eventually so enjoy life and have fun!
3014 2018-08-24 17:30:01 I started to really lose weight when I ate eggs for every meal...my egg diet lol with wheat toast. I wanna get back into that one cause it made me feel energized. I also take coconut oil & green tea vitamins EVERYDAY because they help break down food faster and helps w/cleansing
3015 2018-08-24 17:30:00 @Morrisons Why is diesel at Lichfield 132p and Tamworth 122p per litre. 8 miles apart and both your closest stores to one of biggest oil distribution depot in the country..so it's not transport costs!
3016 2018-08-24 17:29:54 I can tell summer is over bc my face is no longer producing enough oil to fuel a car so I have to start putting on moisturizer again
3017 2018-08-24 17:29:51 Jersey now was pushing for the "oil" show and how it relates to snookie getting unhinged.

3019 2018-08-24 17:29:30 I looove Creme of Nature's Coconut Milk shampoo. The argan oil one is nice, too!
3020 2018-08-24 17:29:27 As of 22% of the world drilling rigs are in west #Texas. At this current rate in 2019 the #US could be come the worlds largest #oil producer.
3021 2018-08-24 17:29:26 You ever have a day where you are just killing it? Woke up hungover from the Birdcloud show last night. Slept 6 hours, got kid 1 to school, got wife 1 to therapy, hit the gym with kid 2. Picked up wife, took a shower and a nap, got the car an oil change with kid 2. All before 2pm
3022 2018-08-24 17:29:20 Well watch how you will wait for that oil down
3023 2018-08-24 17:29:14 Brown minute rice + a little balsamic vinegar and olive oil help
3024 2018-08-24 17:29:12 I got Smoke a tune up, oil change, new tires & a tint job but her side door still dented
3025 2018-08-24 17:29:10 I never realized how many natural products can be used for beauty. I’ve been using coconut and tea tree oil mixed together for my acne scars and the results are amazing 
3026 2018-08-24 17:29:01 The US wanted control of Iran's oil, the coup has long been heralded as the CIA's greatest success internally. They got the Shah, and ended up with the Ayatollah. Karma is a bitch.
3027 2018-08-24 17:28:45 To be fair, unless you’re a smug white guy who makes up facts with a subpar command of the English language that hocks snake oil, you wouldn’t gain any traction with that lot.
3028 2018-08-24 17:28:32 How to get monopoly of local market.?

Step 1: claim coconut oil is poison & kill market
Step 2: sell some junk substitute

3029 2018-08-24 17:28:23 if ya like spicy food that is cause they do use a fair buf of chilli oil
3030 2018-08-24 17:28:09 If ya got essential oil diffuser or a spray bottle try diffusing citrus, sage, eucalyptus... loving this combo! Clary sage is good in there too
3031 2018-08-24 17:27:50 I have not been brainwashed. She is a snake selling snake oil in a form of a book.  It's about her character not political. She has no moral compass never has never will.  Karma is a bitch and it will bite her soon

3033 2018-08-24 17:27:43 I'm so sorry. We're praying for your dad and all of you. Don't know if you've tried CBDa oil and CBD oil. Look up Dr Bonni Goldstein on Instagram.

3037 2018-08-24 17:27:29 I use to have horrible skin, but tea tree oil cleared up my skin so much!!!! I buy all my stuff from the body shop @northstar. That’s all I strictly use. I just started this new moisturizer from Garnier & it works super good! It’s 3 in 1 green tea moisturizer
3038 2018-08-24 17:27:22 Mai goshin Dollar,Ina yinki 
3039 2018-08-24 17:27:21 Everything but the girl reminded me of a tape I used to listen to on repeat because my fm radio didn’t work, Olive Oil ~ Olive, can you throw down some You’re Not Alone?
3040 2018-08-24 17:27:15 People with really greasy hair can save money on their oil change
3041 2018-08-24 17:27:14 "moneyless" - most Venezuelans, especially with the ban on other currencies, confiscated property and resources.

"classless" - Venezuelan business women now strippers in Colombia,  everyone is the "starving class"

"world's resources" - largest oil reserves not enough?
3042 2018-08-24 17:27:13 Agree. Amazed that Conservatives want to interfere in the market and tell the oil industry what to do with their oil. NEP2. #ableg
3043 2018-08-24 17:27:07 Can someone in @MBuhari government be bold enough to tell Nigerians how much this govt has borrowed since they came onboard.
Not telling us much they've done with little that came through oil.
3044 2018-08-24 17:27:01 Agreed just a corny ad by UK standards but someone in India might have thought it might work. If @RedIssue doesn’t like it don’t watch it and stop moaning as #mufc haven’t got an oil sheikh signing blank cheques but need to get money from sponsors
3045 2018-08-24 17:26:59 By facing all kinds of odd situations we are still happy , united , stronger  not disintegrated and weak , discovered oil source and many other material  better days are coming when world will give us the respect we deserve.

3046 2018-08-24 17:26:51 all i want is these braids out my head and a hot oil treatment
3047 2018-08-24 17:26:40 มันดูบ้าบอและไร้ค่าในสายตาทุกคน จนวันนึงมันมีความหมายสำหรับเราแต่เพียงผู้เดียว มันคือความเชื่ออ 
3048 2018-08-24 17:26:38 Ako rin. I put lotion or body oil.
3049 2018-08-24 17:26:34 If all the oil in the earth is pumped out...wont that create a big void?
3050 2018-08-24 17:26:33 @robbwolf do you have thoughts on the lecture in which that Harvard professor refers to coconut oil as poison? My gut tells me it's too reductionist, but my gut also doesn't handle coconut oil all that well.
3051 2018-08-24 17:26:28 @AmbJohnBolton US forces and intelligence in Iraq should be increased and US oil companies brought to Iraq to increase oil production and sell it to the world at high prices to increase America's financial resources.
3052 2018-08-24 17:26:23 The linguine is whole grain / actually has fiber. The sauces don't include Olive oil/vinegar but I imagine you can ask for it?  Also their chicken is... Fried chicken.

I bought this $100 pasta pass for memes. Figured I  should get the least terrible thing.
3053 2018-08-24 17:26:18 Business idea # 1: A @JiffyLube adjacent to a barber shop! Drop off your car for an oil change and get your haircut while you wait!
3054 2018-08-24 17:26:18 The DNC and its Big Oil money will lead us to the Accountability Promised Land!!!!!!
3055 2018-08-24 17:26:13 Essentially: big oil lobbyists give virtue-signaling a try in exchange for environmental protection regulation rollbacks and lawsuit protection. Gee, I don’t know how that could seem suspicious at all. 
3056 2018-08-24 17:26:13 @SecPompeo US forces and intelligence in Iraq should be increased and US oil companies brought to Iraq to increase oil production and sell it to the world at high prices to increase America's financial resources.
3057 2018-08-24 17:25:43 I'm just sleeping and sleeping at any opportunity I get,what's the problem pls
3058 2018-08-24 17:25:42 It was a swish coconut oil in my mouth and cool shower kind of morning. Rejuvenated.
3059 2018-08-24 17:25:31 Real men change they own oil ?
3060 2018-08-24 17:25:29 I’m such a b*tch when I get an oil change because they always try and tell you every part in your car is shot. 
3061 2018-08-24 17:25:11 Those Groupon oils change from valvolive are awesome taking about savings on Synthetic oil my mechanic would have to charge me like $110 And on top of that I get 25% off for all other services and parts nice lol  did I mention the Blondie umm lol 
3062 2018-08-24 17:25:10 Oga average income per head per annum in the period : Cocoa - 14 pounds, palm oil 7 pounds, groundnuts 3 pounds. Western Nigeria exported cocoa and palm oil. Awo the economic magician is a myth .
3063 2018-08-24 17:25:09 2/? Isn't it true that capitalism and the underlying drive of self-interest in people who created this post-scarcity society? I posit that removing that underpinning we would no longer have the excess we do now. Oil companies would no longer look for new sources or technologies
3064 2018-08-24 17:25:05 Ah wonder if the oil that could heal everything from the Universal church could STOP the earthquakes in TnT 
3065 2018-08-24 17:24:58 Want to sell olive oil,palmolin oil so that they can control our own products as per their wish.
3066 2018-08-24 17:24:54 Fr  I’m like man she wild , goes to put  more castor oil on

3068 2018-08-24 17:24:35 Went to change the oil in my friends car, I used his card, didn’t work. So I paid in cash. Then I find out it did charge him. Probly won’t be getting the $30 back. Most likely won’t be
3069 2018-08-24 17:24:29 @Oil_Fast I would like to praise the tanker driver who spotted me filtering through traffic on the M8 near Mollinsburn and moved right over to allow me safe passage. Well done that man. #truegent #observantdriver
3070 2018-08-24 17:24:19 @SecPompeo Control of Iraqi oil is the key to controlling Syria and Iran. The Iraqi government must work to control the political morale in Iraq and remove all Iran's agents from power in Iraq.
3071 2018-08-24 17:24:13 Even if you don't learn to do it yourself, see if there's a high school autoshop class near you. Sometimes they do free/cheap oil changes
3072 2018-08-24 17:24:12 We Keralites consuming coconut oil from thousands of years. As per data availed, Keralites have most lifespan than others. I suspect some lobbying behind this rumour

3075 2018-08-24 17:24:06 Measure seven grams of olive oil then stir vigorously.
3076 2018-08-24 17:23:47 How about a decent job instead? One that could help pay for all those?

Are human beings so worthless that you need to rely on high oil prices to sell national resources for ANYTHING?

3078 2018-08-24 17:23:39 Laura please stop adding to the pain and atrocities of Molly’s gruesome killing by politicizing it, if you care about senseless killings why not address Chris Watt’s killing of his pregnant wife and two daughters thrown in the oil tank?
3079 2018-08-24 17:23:37 Dude, have some respect. You're acting as if PG didn't start with Messi Iniesta Xavi etc, go to Lewandowski Robben and Ribery, then spent a shit load of oil money at city. He's an acceptional coach, but SAF> PG.
3080 2018-08-24 17:23:35 how about instead of vaccinating kids we just baptize them in lavender essential oil when they’re born, that’ll show measles who’s the boss

3082 2018-08-24 17:23:31 Got 50% off my oil change 
3083 2018-08-24 17:23:21 i think it will work better with a glug infused oil in each jar, kinda like antipasto type pickles
3084 2018-08-24 17:23:15 An advantage of not being organized is that you find stuff you didn't know you had. Here "The Usual Gang of Idiots"  presents Bill Gaines, MAD publisher with his "Official Oil Portrait". It had to be the back of his head otherwise Bill would have seen the artist painting it.
3085 2018-08-24 17:23:14 Oiled my scalp with this tea tree oil!! Baybeeeee! Ain’t scratched it since

3087 2018-08-24 17:22:54 Put some mint oil or toothpaste then ur good to@go
3088 2018-08-24 17:22:53 If we could just stand idle and watch, why on earth are we bombing the shit out of entire communities of innocent people? It wouldn't have anything to do with oil, oh no. We're getting involved out of "pure concern" for their wellbeing  moron.
3089 2018-08-24 17:22:47 รำคาญ
3090 2018-08-24 17:22:46 this mechanic really gave me a free oil change.  my pockets are thankful.
3091 2018-08-24 17:22:28 I’m off getting oil changes from Walmart.. went to Walmart off 20 they ain’t have a filter.. Went to Walmart off 161 these mfs ain’t have oil 
3092 2018-08-24 17:22:26 Good insight! I believe Jamnagar is exporting some high end Base Oil Lubricants
3093 2018-08-24 17:22:08 yes even UAE runs metro on subsidy! as oil import country, Pak need to have more projects which can reduce fuel consumption in the country, Metro is one and is need of large cities! 
Like Hospitals and Schools, Metro Bus/train are equally important.
3094 2018-08-24 17:22:02 Thank you Emma, we have stopped eating our favourite Digestive biscuits that contain Palm Oil,
and all products that use Palm Oil too!  We all need to take action now.

3096 2018-08-24 17:21:58 I will never understand how women don’t know what’s going on with their cars. Like, how you not know about your oil, transmission, etc??
3097 2018-08-24 17:21:52 I forgot how much I didn't like it! ROFL 
but my scalp can finally breathe. I was every three weeks or once a month, oil my scalp with Haitian castor oil and use Creme of nature's leave in conditioner spray (Argan oil or coconut milk) to moisturize. 
3098 2018-08-24 17:21:47 No garlic sauce. Garlic cloves topping. No oil.
3099 2018-08-24 17:21:42 Since he is religious i am sure Jesus will ask him about all the illegal wars he supported and the millions of people dead over lies and oil.  Eventually everyone leaves this earth and I wonder if he is thinking about all the evil he help spread and feels remorse. I doubt it
3100 2018-08-24 17:21:33 too early on oil here......will post, but i see risk to the upside to be short
3101 2018-08-24 17:21:32 i put too much eucalyptus oil in my diffuser :/
3102 2018-08-24 17:21:11 SAY IT LOUD! MAYO PROUD!

(Of course not. It's the eggs that get beaten, while slowly streaming in the oil because THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MAYO FOR FRIES)
3103 2018-08-24 17:21:11 tried to buy a salad dressing at the store and could not find a single one without soybean or canola oil.  Even the ones bragging about avocado or olive oil contained seed oils.
3104 2018-08-24 17:21:11 What is the solution of IITs in India (Iyer Iyengar institutes of Technology) for the management of human excreta?

Send Socalled Dalits into septic tanks by applying oil to their bodies and liquor to bear with stink. If they don't die, they shift shit carrying it to another 2km.
3105 2018-08-24 17:21:05 Let,s give away our oil in Alberta and hydro power in Quebec as well.  Good thing we still have the aerospace industry in Quebec with Bombardier,s Cseries... oh wait, we already gave that away to Airbus!
3106 2018-08-24 17:21:04 I officially know how to make coconut oil
3107 2018-08-24 17:20:58 #Btw, so what if they wanted to seize the land?! It was stolen from them in the first place. Blacks make up 90% of pop. and own less than 4% of the land. You wanted to seize middle east oil. I guess only whites should seize stuff. Trying to make the world great again?!#PATHETIC

Dear sir,  why would've UAE,  United Arab Emirates, will buy petrol and diesel from us, they have their own oil refinery's and they are selling to others

3123 2018-08-24 17:18:57 Those of us who have lived in California for decades haven’t been fooled and have always known that Brown sides with big oil for the money. And we know that appealing to his better angels is a losing strategy.
3124 2018-08-24 17:18:48 Provide proof that this opinion was bought and paid for by big oil or STFU.

3128 2018-08-24 17:18:34 I use coconut oil and pointed tweezers. I lightly tap the coconut oil and let that sit 3-5mins and the crush the adhesive with the tweezers. I use to rub with baby oil but you still rip off lashes and damage.

The Golan Heights are part of Israel not Syria, and as a sovereign Nation, they are free to explore oil drilling as would benefit their Nation.

3197 2018-08-24 17:12:05 But "burn less oil" isn't a helpful statement.  Oil is hardly just a fuel, the entire petrochemical industry isn't a replaceable thing.  Plastics (most of which we cannot replace the feed stock), pharmaceuticals (same problem), lubricants... all of these need research...

3199 2018-08-24 17:11:53 @AmbJohnBolton America can raise Iraqi oil production to 7 million barrels, sell it to the world at high prices and finance the US military from Iraqi oil
3200 2018-08-24 17:11:44 Also the fact that something is a "conspiracy theory" doesn't mean it's not actually happening. It's a "conspiracy theory" to say big oil companies are sewing disinformation about climate change so they can profit by destroying the world, yet it's inarguably true.

3208 2018-08-24 17:11:07 Norway doesn’t even own its entire state oil company, even though that company is like two third of all state ownership. Plus it just gives them a cut of all the surplus labor and imperial loot around the world.

3255 2018-08-24 17:07:07 Makes sense. No heavy engines, transmissions, drive shafts, mufflers, sensors, or other under-vehicle parts, or need to drain oil, change filters, etc, so no need for a lift. A jack is good for tires & shocks. Battery replacement may still need larger equipment, but is rare.

3262 2018-08-24 17:06:21 While I get that not everyone on Earth has a Harvard degree how did you guys seriously think coconut oil was good for you? Did you not read the label or something? Do they even teach English class to millennials? Take your avocado toast and leave.
3263 2018-08-24 17:06:10 @SecPompeo US forces must control all institutions in Iraq and must control their control of Iraqi oil installations. America must oversee all Iraqi oil exports to prevent Iran from stealing Iraqi oil resources.

More oil rigs in CA.
Preferably in the sight line of Hollywood and coastal elites.

Because I am a naturally anxious person.
3271 2018-08-24 17:05:19 I think India and Netherlands buy oil, and then they export some of it as a petrochemicals.
3272 2018-08-24 17:05:18 and i don’t need ugly oil fans coming up here saying she’s a flop
3273 2018-08-24 17:05:18 ohh and you are also showing us how much Obama was a corporate joke on the grass roots of the democratic party look at oil production under Obama it shows Obama was to the right of even Bush on this issue.
3274 2018-08-24 17:05:17 Otoh, plastic is more or less permanent sequestration of oil. Point taken tho 
3275 2018-08-24 17:05:06 Just took Wakanda for her first service and oil change 
3276 2018-08-24 17:05:06 I hope the media gives his family space and I hope he can be comfortable for his last days. THC or CBD oil can help him to at least not be in as much pain.
3277 2018-08-24 17:05:02 I miss having a man who would change the oil in my car so I don’t have to go to jiffy lube smhhh 
3278 2018-08-24 17:04:37 U.S. Rig Count is down 13  rigs from last week to 1,044, with #oil rigs down 9 to 860, #natgas rigs down  4 to 182, and miscellaneous rigs unchanged at 2.
3279 2018-08-24 17:04:35 September 7th, come check out my art at SoulRide yoga studio!! Lots of oil paintings, some glass work, and sculpture work!! #emporiafirstfriday
3280 2018-08-24 17:04:25 There are plenty of years of oil and gas left in the North Sea. The methods of extraction will change and the volumes may be lowers but majors and independents have development plans way beyond 2040 in many cases. Add to this the further integration and development of renewables.
3281 2018-08-24 17:04:19 You know that self sustaining club that doesn’t need ‘dirty oil money’ called Liverpool?

- £91m loss in 22 reporting months to May 2013

- FSG cleared a £46m loan in 2012/13 

-FSG wrote off £69m debt in 2015 and invested a further £49m

-FSG ‘loaned’ Liverpool £110m in 2016
3282 2018-08-24 17:04:13 does that account for dollar/oil manipulations and US Sanctions ? i bet not.
3283 2018-08-24 17:04:12 Basil is good, pine nuts are good, olive oil is good, garlic is good. Pesto fucking sucks.

3287 2018-08-24 17:03:37 What is Very Interesting is REd states Legislatures are crafting and passing laws to restrict peaceful protests including attaching jail time for peaceful protests for oil industries mostly. NOW @GOP does protect 1st amendments rights of ALL AMERICAN'S & LIMITS FREEEDOM, NEW GOP
3288 2018-08-24 17:03:37 Car owner groups can be hilarious. 

Person puts up a picture of an error message on the dash saying service oil and asks what the message could be?

Like what?

Not even a hint of sarcasm. It's the little things that keep you wanting to smash shit up
3289 2018-08-24 17:03:26 Antalet aktiva olje- och gasriggar i USA minskade med 13 stycken denna veckan till 1 044 (årsskiftet 929), enligt Baker Hughes #OOTT #oil
3290 2018-08-24 17:03:16 Watch the oil and gas industry too. If we had a full time staff we could be keeping an eye on these things, past, present and probable future (attempts at) usurpation of wild horse herd areas.
3291 2018-08-24 17:03:16 mmmmmm i hate the scar on my face but don't wanna spend a million dollars on bio oil

3299 2018-08-24 17:02:56 An automobile made an illegal left turn in front of our LRV, resulting in a collision. We have to clear oil and debris from the trackway before it is safe to resume service, but we are working on this currently.

3307 2018-08-24 17:02:04 Also, see if it'll dissolve off with oil rather than water. Any kind of oil. Cooking oil, baby oil... maybe not engine oil though 
3308 2018-08-24 17:02:01 @IRSTaxFraud @ChuckGrassley If the IRS thinks nobody noticed the missing oil money; they would be wrong. It had better be included in the 30% the Whistleblower gets. We'll know if it's not. We know how much money people make off their oil wells. We're watching you.
3309 2018-08-24 17:02:01 Let me try to explain the science of this. A french fry is a perfect fried food, yes, adding oil & salt to the (white or yellow) potato. Mayo affords the opportunity to add add’l fat — oil & eggs. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.
3310 2018-08-24 17:01:59 My dentist gave me a whole bottle of cbd oil for my anxiety lmfao dope

3320 2018-08-24 17:01:25 "70% of workers worked in private, capitalist enterprise" - except petroleum makes up 98% (!!!) of Venezuela's exports and both oil and gas are nationalized.

So what's the point of a private sector like that?

Not to mention - thanks to Maduro almost 4mln people lost their jobs.

3342 2018-08-24 16:59:50 This study was conducted by a guy who’s been called out multiple times for quackery & snake oil. He literally sells pills he claims can “prevent or stop Alzheimers.” The neuroimaging method he uses isn’t even considered valid by the American Psychiatric Association or his peers.

3345 2018-08-24 16:59:09 So I’m sitting in my statistics class and my teacher goes “okay I just have one more question for you guys” and writes in the board “are you in favor of using nuclear power plants to reduce the dependence on foreign oil?”

3416 2018-08-26 23:51:45 We need to treat oil & gas like cigarettes. People can buy them, but they should have to look at pictures of the tar sands, or an oil-covered sea bird, or starving polar bears every time. If we had to look at the cost of our consumption, maybe it would change our consumption.

(directions are the same for all the oils) 
- soak a cotton swab in the oil and apply to each eyebrow & all around

- leave it on for 30 min or overnight

- wash off with water, you can do this once a day, preferably every night before bed

Some fellows have misread the charts and patterns. Bear in mind, they should be read as a concept in regard to the endpoints which have no specific timings/levels. Never think they are engineering drawings. Trading is an art. Precision is not the subject.
3437 2018-08-26 23:48:22 mrs dalloway said she would buy the cbd oil herself
3438 2018-08-26 23:48:17 Yes, but perhaps not for the reason you think.  Canola is more often referred to as rapeseed than canola.  Might confuse shopper thinking they are getting canola oil.

3440 2018-08-26 23:47:49 Operating in a silo I think we are both right, unfortunately oil price is not objective. I think the world found the true inflection point in 2008 and everything else is just noise.

3446 2018-08-26 23:45:51 How about a supply/quota/price cartel set up by Cdn oil companies like OPEC? We could call it the Cdn Advantage Oil Supply or CAOS.

No govt would allow energy to operate like Dairy Supply Management system.

@AndrewScheer @JustinTrudeau are corrupt & on the dairy take for votes.
3447 2018-08-26 23:45:31 some people just have oily skin naturally, like me. i just prefer to be oily at all times. however you can combat this by using oil blotting papers and/or toner
3448 2018-08-26 23:45:22 We learned our lesson from letting 18-year olds vote...no thanks!  Until you are earning wages and paying taxes, you have no skin in the game and unable to comprehend the snake oil sold by politicians.
3449 2018-08-26 23:45:05 One would think something as simple as mozzarella caprese is easily made, but the devil's in the details.

Not enough to slice tomatoes and mozzarella cheese and douse it with vinagrette and olive oil.

3493 2018-08-26 23:36:14 CSV files and internationalization are like oil and water

3503 2018-08-26 23:34:23 I thought it was because rust prevents fungal growth, so mixing it with linseed oil stained the wood to prevent rot. Not so much that it was cheap paint but that it was antifungal. Was probably the cheapest anti rot solution though, and usually home made.

3505 2018-08-26 23:33:32 They have $19t in oil reserves alone. But can't borrow against it or buy against it. You are a fool if you think international finance works on the basis of cash in the bank.
3506 2018-08-26 23:33:15 This is my first go at a tri-tip. I kept it simple...kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, with olive oil and a dash of Worcestershire sauce for the marinade.
3507 2018-08-26 23:33:09 the good thing about introducing your mum to your body shower and oil is that once it finishes, your supplier(read mum) knows what to do.

3518 2018-08-26 23:31:20 This is how they are spending your oil money
3519 2018-08-26 23:31:20 Obama, Hillary, and Kerry waged the biggest covert war in CIA history resulting in the murder of half a million people of color in Libya and Syria.... all for oil pipeline routes.
3520 2018-08-26 23:31:09 Alaskans own 3,670,000 shares of SINO OIL AND GAS HOLDINGS LTD, worth $88,781. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in HONG KONG.
3521 2018-08-26 23:30:44 So what to do? It’s a regional intervention action or concede Venezuela as the 2nd communist Cuba in the Hemisphere except this one is oil and mineral rich with Russian, Chinese and Iranian partners.
3522 2018-08-26 23:30:36 Trump doesn't measure up to 
McCain's bravery,
Obama's decency, or
Hilllary's grit

...of course he is unable to say a kind word.

History will judge McCain well and will judge Trump as the snake oil salesman that he is.

3545 2018-08-26 23:25:48 @GovMattMead we need oil from coal extraction plant for fuel. we did it in WW11 500 000 new jobs can be created from plant emits no air or water pollution from plant new oil source gives our nation 41% more oil reserves for our country.this process not new and has proved it works
3546 2018-08-26 23:25:48 I once hauled olive oil back from a tiny shop in France. They had it @zingermans 10 minutes from my house. There’s almost no “only” anywhere any more.

3550 2018-08-26 23:23:43 Oil burning? Or is it that Hamilton and his fans are absolutely dreadful losers and suggest his rival cheated to distract from Ferrari closing the gap. If anybody knows about tricks it's Hamilton. #liegate.

3561 2018-08-26 23:21:17 @KellyO . I just watched you say on MSNBC say that the Senator from my State of Colorado could be the next lion. I have been an RN in CO for over 40 years. Gardner doesn’t speak for us. He votes against our healthcare, our environment, and answers to Big Oil and the NRA! Shame!
3562 2018-08-26 23:21:14 Yes, we could use Peter Lougheed back. He and Pierre Trudeau fought, but they also worked together. Few people know that Trudeau (I know, I know, NEP, bad policy!) invested federal money to develop oil sands technology at a time when petroleum was less than $20 a barrel. #cdnpoli
3563 2018-08-26 23:20:49 3 of them were outside the US
As for 9/11 the US still buys & sells to Saudi Arabia no matter who in office so if you want to stop that you'd have to stop buying oil 
Good luck

3579 2018-08-26 23:18:59 Bought a used Focus 5yrs ago for $15k. Gets 35mpg. At 35 mpg, savings is $70 for 1200 miles, or $5000 over 5 yrs at 18k miles/yr. my maint so far = 1 oil change every 10k miles and 4 spark plugs. My total cost ~$20k. How much $ was his model 3?   The diff pays for 20% down.
3580 2018-08-26 23:18:40 What brand of CBD oil do you use. The one I am trying is not good on my stomach.

3583 2018-08-26 23:18:09 I accidently sprayed my hair with alot of vanilla perfume instead of coconut oil spray smfh
3584 2018-08-26 23:17:57 But Nate smells like baby oil, EJ smells like douche, and Eric smells like old lady asian
3585 2018-08-26 23:17:46 Since my car needs an oil change, my bff drove me around today.. we went to lunch, multiple book stores, sang into a giant spaghetti pot, and danced in Target’s parking lot. She’s one of a kind and I’m so grateful for her 
3586 2018-08-26 23:17:18 Lolol oil
3587 2018-08-26 23:17:13 So I just put coconut oil in my hair. I suddenly have a huge urge to go to target. But I can’t because I have oil in my hair

3591 2018-08-26 23:16:43 Why tf did we not learn the basics of what to do when you get in an accident, or how to change tires, oil, or basic car maintenance in drivers ed. My parents really paid all that money so I could learn how to use my blinker correctly and know which pedal is gas and brake??? Wtf.
3592 2018-08-26 23:16:33 Next everyone will need to take guns for colonoscopy, Pap smears, mammograms, wisdom teeth removal, facials, spa day, oil changes, donut shops, I guess no place is safe really.
3593 2018-08-26 23:16:32 The ignorance on here is unbelievable. Black people justifying colonialism? Have they read the book "King Leopold's ghost? " to know what colonialism did in Congo? Did you know the kind of genocide consul Moore committed in ijaw land cos he wanted palm oil? Jeez! The nerve!

3595 2018-08-26 23:15:47 You will do nothing but pay lip service. But hey it’s Sunday so you have time right..Not a day when you’re scheduled to rake in cash from other ALEC members like those in Oklahoma. Why would a man seeking a Senate seat in FL be collecting cash from OK oil and gas billionaires? 
3596 2018-08-26 23:15:38 Liberals corrupt everything GOD designs! If a car tells you to put oil in your engine are you gonna put water in it?
3597 2018-08-26 23:15:37 Totally.  Had some fish oil pills earlier.   But your suggestion seems a lot more healthy.   Giddy up.
3598 2018-08-26 23:15:22 I'm assuming rendered fat of vulture, since there are other recipes using bear fat and bacon, and it's supposed to be combed through the hair. But the lizards seem to just be thrown in the pot, or "oil of lizard" is used.

3. All of Scotland’s Oil Revenue and Export Profits.

3604 2018-08-26 23:13:03 Well....technically abi actually "annoiting oil" is just olive oil that was blessed by a man or woman of God
3605 2018-08-26 23:12:36 But what about the snake oil that @SenOrrinHatch pushes from the "health food" industry.
3606 2018-08-26 23:12:20 I completed a BS in Nutritional Science in '78. Carbs are the least expense energy source. The 'No carb" diet has been an exercise in quackery.

Also, we knew then that coconut oil was main[y short-chain saturated fat, a prime raw material the body to convert to cholesterol.

3608 2018-08-26 23:12:12 The wise Jaclyn Hill once told me that sometimes your face is over producing oil when you use those kind of products because it tries to compensate and I was skeptical but now I know SHES RIGHT

3610 2018-08-26 23:11:07 I mixed it with grape seed oil because I’m not too fond of the smell of just castor oil. And I applied it to my scalp twice a week and put a shower cap over it for a couple hours

3621 2018-08-26 23:09:50 The skill and insights in writing this book are definately underestimated by sales copies on Amazon. It is not just so readable, but also bears enormous, useful and important business wits and details, history backgrounds , helping readers to grasp a 3D image of the oil industry.
3622 2018-08-26 23:09:40 It's also the season where the mythology gets really wild with the Black Oil.

3626 2018-08-26 23:09:00 a lustrous rainbowlike play of color caused by differential refraction of light waves (as from an oil slick, soap bubble, or fish scales) that tends to change as the angle of view changes
3627 2018-08-26 23:08:57 So calling fish oil in general a sham seems unwarranted, calling fish oil as a heart prophylactic for diabetics a sham is prob. true

3634 2018-08-26 23:07:13 Everyone knows that old saying, “the wheel that squeaks once and then waits quietly gets the oil.”
3635 2018-08-26 23:07:11 Oh come on. Many of them are actually farmers. And they are not paid anything compared to what those who advocate for oil companies.
3636 2018-08-26 23:07:10 I used to get the oil well question all the time when people found out I was from Texas. Most of the time they were joking but jokes on them cause we do. 
3637 2018-08-26 23:06:59 Roasted potatoes, cut up small, tossed in oil and salt and pepper maybe herbs de Provence 400 for 45 min
3638 2018-08-26 23:06:52 For real? Castor oil really did help my edges a few years back when they were trying to run for the border. It'd probably be better than the harsher chemicals in the lash boost.
3639 2018-08-26 23:06:42 Oil fouling might just be gaskets, right? But based on what  you've already replaced, I'm guessing most likely causes of the cylinders not firing is either coils or ECU (if applicable). So maybe switch coils around to test that?

3650 2018-08-26 23:05:28 Countries need dollars to buy commodities like oil, which are all traded in USD. But no one is holding dollars as a support for their own currency to my knowledge. The world doesn't need $20 trillion in dollar assets, but right now, it's ok with it. For how long? I don't know.

3667 2018-08-26 23:03:00 Right in the oil city 
3668 2018-08-26 23:02:52 Get real, Africa does not gave the money to drill for their own oil, anyway the leaders know that it will be stolen just like in Nigeria and they are not stupid enough to bankroll such a venture for their people to steal it.

3674 2018-08-26 23:01:35 I wish all restaurants were like that.  And no cooking in trans-fat oil unless the customer asks for it.
3675 2018-08-26 23:01:34 @PremierScottMoe @JustinTrudeau so B.C doesn't want our oil going through there province . But we don't want their smoke in ours, surely their carbon is leeching it's way into sask. Let's collect on that. At least I should be compensated for lack of sun during my holidays

3686 2018-08-26 22:59:58 The best solution is to ride a bike. Granted. Are electric cars better than gas-powered? Hell yeah. If you costed out the true costs of fossil fuels -destruction of the climate, oil spills, pollution, ill health, it would be overwhelmingly prohibitively horrendously expensive.
3687 2018-08-26 22:59:56 The Us has invested millions in sponsoring coups and destabilising Venezuela govt (hint: lots of oil).  So it's not really a good example in my eyes.  The blending of capitalism and  socialism in Denmark however has been hugely successful.  No?

3689 2018-08-26 22:59:49 Since the petrodollar system was created in the 1970s constant war  ensured USD was world reserve ccy. Exclusive USD oil pricing created into demand for USD and funded the us warfare / welfare state. Us war machine fought to defend it but now bankrupts us

3715 2018-08-26 22:54:57 But not an insurmountable sum. By increasing the tax on NS oil to 2010 levels we would take an additional £6B. Oil is now at the same price as 2010. Other savings can be made on the portion of the money spent on Scotlands behalf by WM. It's all about choices post Indy.

Around a week later my

Coconut oil has been proven to stimulate hair growth and thickness. Just before you wash your hair, 
rub some (liquid) coconut oil 
into your roots and ends of 
your hair. Let it sit for 10minutes 
then wash it out really well.

3805 2018-08-26 22:40:34 ok. but how about the Colorado man who killed his family and dumped them in a vat of oil? Does he enough media attention? no. you know why? because he's not the right skin tone. There two sides to every argument, We're just arguing two of the same crime. who'd better?
3806 2018-08-26 22:40:13 Gas prices would sky rocket, if we cut off oil from middle east. To get access to more oil here, we'd have to dismantle some EPA regulations to allow for example getting oil from national parks etc. Your proposing what if scenario that experts agree would hurt the US
3807 2018-08-26 22:40:09 Oh if anyone needs any tips on phlegm I’m your girl  CBD oil is also very useful. It’s bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory so it’s perfect if you’re chesty. Ginger is also your friend. Put ginger in everything

3815 2018-08-26 22:39:29 Awh so Friday was the  anniversary of the day that I asked Mike who was basically a stranger to come with me to get my oil changed my and sit in bean bag chairs at walmart. Look how far we've come 
3816 2018-08-26 22:39:16 Chilli oil on the bog roll.
3817 2018-08-26 22:39:02 Hope the US people smarten up quick before Trump ruins our oceans  seeking oil.
3818 2018-08-26 22:39:01 Maybe our oil fund!!!!
3819 2018-08-26 22:38:23 They also don’t produce a single barrel of oil. Coincidence?
3820 2018-08-26 22:38:09 Si es madera natural le aconsejo usar los productos de bona para mantenerlo con brillo sino trapearlo con poca agua y Murphy oil.

Welcome Weekend
3825 2018-08-26 22:37:23 Hey I see you recently purchased some CBD Oil!! Next time would you mind checking out my site and purchasing some from me, my company has excellent ratings!!
3826 2018-08-26 22:37:05 Young Oil Change  lol
3827 2018-08-26 22:36:52 As soon as we start deporting all white males, sure. Then we'd have a beautiful mother in Colorado alive and her two gorgeous daughters wouldn't have been slaughtered and thrown in oil bins. Build a wall around disturbed, white men. They can even keep their guns too!
3828 2018-08-26 22:36:46 More importantly, who's cleaning up the oil slick?
3829 2018-08-26 22:36:31 My mom has this oil mixture consisting of peppermint, almond, tea tree, and Jamaican black castor oils and she’s been using it on my scalp. Baaaaaby. It is so bomb and my head smells so minty!
3830 2018-08-26 22:36:25 Black seed oil or Olive oil mix with raw 
3831 2018-08-26 22:36:17 You ain’t say nothing slick to a can of oil
3832 2018-08-26 22:36:13 This tweet gave me an idea for the next @jasonrantz product.  How about a "Safe Space Comfort Package"
* Soft plush fleece snuggy
* Mike Lindell designed comfort pillow with wrap around hugging arms
* choice of flavored binky
* single use Lavender and Frankincense oil diffuser.
3833 2018-08-26 22:36:09 Try using castor oil every night before bed
3834 2018-08-26 22:35:52 くっそwwwイモリ行動め(´・ω・｀)足跡無しに芋られたらなんも出来んぞぉ。

3836 2018-08-26 22:35:28 Summer shrugged and layed back, on her back. She opened her legs and didn't really care who saw, what she was doing. She licked her fingers, closing her legs back as she pointed at the oil. 

"go ahead......i would love that..... Right now....,"
3837 2018-08-26 22:35:22 Coconut oil! Don't go for products with lots of ingredients.
3838 2018-08-26 22:35:13 City of Tracy really out here trying to make me lose a wheel or crack my oil pan today
3839 2018-08-26 22:34:50 Kevin McCarthy should know better the #2 money earner in his district is AG. The #1 is Oil. So now you know that he's not elected with local supporters money. He doesn't give a shit for us locals. Vote Libertarian. Dump the duopoly.
3840 2018-08-26 22:34:36 Was eitherthat or it would drip oil like a filled sponge

プロフ欄の幽香ちゃん好きというところを見てフォローさせていただきました！よろしくお願いします！！
3842 2018-08-26 22:34:34 On that #BreakfastNews coverage of the Regime Change in the Prim Mincers’ Office; will you let us know what News wasn’t covered last week ? Anything on the Western Front of Currency Wars ? Anymore Oil & Central Bank Independent Nations in South America been destabilised ?
3843 2018-08-26 22:34:29 Leaves out the evil American Neocon agenda? Venezuela is under attack from USA 4 its Oil&resources! Dont think they wont do the same here!
3844 2018-08-26 22:34:15 Yup. It's crazy.
3845 2018-08-26 22:34:13 I do use it, but not as a straight oil
3846 2018-08-26 22:34:07 I simply shared what I had noted about FUEL savings on a roadtrip. Yet if I don't also tweet detailed comparisons of MSRPs, insurance, depreciation, maintenance, subsidies for EVs & oil companies, lifespans, etc., I should just… STFU? Geeeeezus. Please fill in those blanks, OK?
3847 2018-08-26 22:33:51 We'll see in 2019 wether you have sense or he has,muje zuwa
3848 2018-08-26 22:33:36 More importantly. What’s in his hair! Coconut oil? 
3849 2018-08-26 22:33:33 they had a clean skincare kit that they just discontinued (boo!) and it was SO GOOD. like 2 different moisturizers, a mask, face oil, 2 makeup removers, a hair mask, 2 cleansers. I would die for it
3850 2018-08-26 22:33:32 What is the genesis of the money? What did u have when there was no oil? History dictate our future trouble man
3851 2018-08-26 22:33:21 Like the Carrier jobs that moved to Mexico?  Harley Davidson?  It's all snake oil.
3852 2018-08-26 22:33:09 There are growing number of countries are interested in replacing the dollar as a medium in global oil trades and other transactions.
3853 2018-08-26 22:33:08 Amen. I want the cleansing oil.
3854 2018-08-26 22:32:56 Sorry for your pain Marilynhope you get some relief I am allergic to Lyrica most nerve endings Cymbalta Nerontin etcsince 2000 I'm using cannabis oilit's amazing for my  isomonianauseous crawling in skin ugh just bout everything 
3855 2018-08-26 22:32:27 Coconut oil is coming thru on my hair
3856 2018-08-26 22:32:26 It’s not even funny how burnt I am, why did I get mwi on the beach, why did I use tanning oil, so many questions
3857 2018-08-26 22:32:13 Problem w/polls is - No one ever knows anyone polled. Every friend & fam member I know who voted for the snake oil conman still hold hard to blind belief in him. They think he's done things to improve lives. They don't know how but they just believe it. Polls are wrong.
3858 2018-08-26 22:32:08 Either did we, our oil comes from our wells, and Venezuala wonder why you dont know that?  maybe because you don't know how the world really works, try getting out more
3859 2018-08-26 22:31:48 Fam, it's a roast, that means oil
3860 2018-08-26 22:31:41 You ruined perfectly good man n cheese by throwing it into boiling oil
3861 2018-08-26 22:31:38 When did Democrat need a case to impeach 

Means dems think. Oil&H20 don't go together
3862 2018-08-26 22:31:33 Human capital is in fact THE scarce resource, not oil that Venezuela has 

Plenty of examples in many other countries worldwide with little to no natural resources like Japan.
3863 2018-08-26 22:31:12 And she’s disingenuous because we know she’s going to keep fetishizing guns and pretending they’re good for defense when she’s just throwing out a sales pitch she’s using, the nra is just a network of glorified snake oil salesmen
3864 2018-08-26 22:31:09 Back off man......your cutting into my arena here! Snake oil and foo foo dust for everybody.
3865 2018-08-26 22:30:50 Look into those stats a little deeper bro.  Trust me.  It’s not nearly that dire.  One is too many for sure, but people peddling that stat are snake oil salesman.
3866 2018-08-26 22:30:49 The treaty of union between Scotland and England states we should equal partners!

59 mps out of 650!
Utter contempt for Scotland who voted Remain!
Power grab of devolved powers (you know the ones about control of oil, gas, fracking, fishing, etc)!

3876 2018-08-26 22:29:09 Hey I see you recently purchased some CBD Oil! Next time would you mind checking out my site and purchasing some from me, the company that I’m with has excellent ratings!!
3877 2018-08-26 22:28:42 It was recently reported that though coconut oil is NOT poisonous, it is also NOT a "superfood"...it is, in fact, right in the middle of the two extremes...enjoy, in moderation, of course...

3880 2018-08-26 22:27:58 @BingingWBabish If you fry something and there is leftover oil what do you do with the oil do you keep it for a future fry, or you dispose of it?
3881 2018-08-26 22:27:54 We should of met up i had some gorilla glue oil
3882 2018-08-26 22:27:38 What do you call it when you want equality where it bring you benefit and inequality when it doesn't .... privilege.  I don't see you demanding it in family courts, I don't see you demanding equal representation for oil rig and sanitation workers, what about criminal sentencing?
3883 2018-08-26 22:26:59 Seems like there’s never a good time to get my oil changed why am I about to be here for almost 2 hours 
3884 2018-08-26 22:26:49 I’m SOO beyond blessed having blade. While I was asleep he changed my oil, and breaks on my car and then he took me to eat and is now getting me energy drinks for work, he didn’t even make me go inside with him to get them.

3892 2018-08-26 22:25:52 It’s amazing that you LIE with all the facts in plain sight...wake up America...he is a charlatan...a snake oil salesman.
3893 2018-08-26 22:25:44 Anyone have an oil diffuser? Any good oil combinations y’all recommend?
3894 2018-08-26 22:25:38 Okay, You should still check your oil, check for any oil sprayed on anything etc, if you cant see anything bring it in for a check up right away. Sometimes a check engine light could just a sensor fault or sometimes there could be an issue there :)
3895 2018-08-26 22:24:52 Olive Oil
3896 2018-08-26 22:24:43 When I was too ill to work for a while a decade ago, QC welfare paid about $600 & my lease was $490 w/o utilities. Telephone $25, campstove fuel & oil lamp...had about $5/week +$2 foodbank for groceries, no bus tickets. Politicians should try that for a while: they'd learn fast.
3897 2018-08-26 22:24:38 So all that claim and all you have is number 1 super power?

1. They have 1 carrier group, we have 10.
2. They have an economy about to decline due to demographics
3. Not even close on nukes
4. Barely have a blue water navy
5. Fighting to have any link to an oil supply
Why again?
3898 2018-08-26 22:24:29 Then Forbes must have it wrong ?state GDP collapse as oil exports accounted for 48%,  and sales are headed for zero production, fell from 3million barrels a day to 1 million since 2010 Blocked state oil firm selling bonds in US plus ban on any trade in Venezuelan debt.
3899 2018-08-26 22:24:03 Women want these guys with manicured finger nails and toes.  They want Metro sexual men. No more real guys in jeans and tees that can change their own oil, do a break job on the family car or put an addition on the house. It's a lost art being a real guy.
3900 2018-08-26 22:23:57 Baby oil does wonders
3901 2018-08-26 22:23:50 the AC is out in my house upstairs and it’s so mf hot in my room my coconut oil melted
3902 2018-08-26 22:23:34 Preseason football is worse for you than coconut oil.
3903 2018-08-26 22:23:13 They gave me free oil change and car wash and that’s why I came here in the first place!
3904 2018-08-26 22:23:12 And millions are not derp. Clubs were first used how about them or bow and arrows , axes , boiling oil, rope ( plenty hanged) Guillotine. Have a TRUMPTASTIC DAY

3909 2018-08-26 22:22:46 Jessica, no it doesn't belong to the American Indians.  First, homo sapiens isn't a native species...the American Indians migrated from Asia during the Ice Age.  Second, the oil dates back to the era of dinosaurs...long before any human or pre-human species existed.
3910 2018-08-26 22:22:44 Demand for oil is going to fall while supply is going to rise. Markets do not always behave in the way the economics textbooks predict, but this time, they will.
3911 2018-08-26 22:22:42 My body get oil ..
3912 2018-08-26 22:22:41 Oil is the status quo. Mayo is a weird sub
3913 2018-08-26 22:22:41 But the existence and survival of the Venezuelan regime would only make the hemisphere more dangerous. Th Maduro regime is a Russian proxy and is not only giving away oil assets to Russia, Venezuela can home Russian naval base. also a safe haven for hezbollah & leftist terrorists

3920 2018-08-26 22:22:04 Brush a lug of oil in batches.
3921 2018-08-26 22:22:00 @KasumiKriss what did your vegan diet consist of? I have a friend thats vegan and he swares by it. He’s a no oil vegan which is hardcore.
3922 2018-08-26 22:21:58 Not oil, opium.
Same reason the USA invaded Afghanistan, and why it won't leave until evicted by the Afghan people.
3923 2018-08-26 22:21:39 For the past year I have been brushing my teeth once a day with coconut oil and ombre a day with regular toothpaste. Since I started the coconut oil my dental hygienist sys that the plaque bulldup that I used to get has been dramatically reduced.
3924 2018-08-26 22:21:36 I just want everyone to know that cbd oil changed my life. I’ve been on countless medications to try to cope with my anxiety and nothing worked or was worth the side effects. If you struggle with anxiety I HIGHLY recommend giving cbd a try.

3930 2018-08-26 22:20:23 Exactly.....I see it all the time."They are called "junk food vegans" (e.g. Oreo cookies are vegan)  Technically I am a vegan, but I won't eat at a vegan restaurant because they use sugar, oil and salt in almost all of their foods.
3931 2018-08-26 22:20:13 Back on Gas prices: US shale oil is highly profitable at $80 a barrel, so production is bound to expand, and increase supply. Europe had a weaker-than-expected first quarter; China is clearly slowing down.
3932 2018-08-26 22:20:07 Is this for real?

I currently have a call option in oil that expires on Friday, August 31sr

3934 2018-08-26 22:19:55 A gas station stop for a new hybrid is 5 minutes every 600 miles with no pre-planning necessary. An oil change is once a year. Want to bet which car would spend more time in a service center over the next 12 months? You're trying to rationalize the unrationalizable.
3935 2018-08-26 22:19:30 Khadafi and Libya were in the way of an oil pipeline plan and you had an Administration that was funding and building up Isis!!

3940 2018-08-26 22:19:02 Oil price keeps rising – will it come back to earth with a bump? If top oil analysts are right and the cost of crude is set to carry on rising, hitting $100 a barrel over the coming months, the big story of 2019 is going to be how oil came down to earth with a bump.
3941 2018-08-26 22:19:01 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
3942 2018-08-26 22:18:51 That might be a problem. I'll be thoroughly coated in baby oil which will make it very difficult for you to remove me with your eyes closed. I think you'll just have to accept defeat on this one, Pyjama Boy.
3943 2018-08-26 22:18:35 They can sell oil whenever they need $.  Low debt/GDP and their gold holdings continue to grow.  Say what you want about Putin, but the guy has done a great job managing Russia's finances.
3944 2018-08-26 22:17:55 At the expense of $1 Trillion a year. You're a moron giving the rich and corporations hugh tax breaks. Where are the pay increases? Where are the jobs? Cutting SS, MC and MC, trade wars, high price oil!
3945 2018-08-26 22:17:51 Me, putting peppermint oil on my temples for my headache like a smart hippie: hell yah

3953 2018-08-26 22:15:51 I am really hoping that season 2 of #Succession at least introduces the POSSIBILITY of a new media corporation fronted by African-Americans. I'm tired of watching white people fight white people over money and occasionally an Arab character shows up cos oil money.
3954 2018-08-26 22:15:44 You won’t die, if oil was the same price like in the days of GEJ we won’t even be discussing hardship or if we had savings from GEJ days we would have been using it to Hold side for the This tough period.... you can’t eat your cake and have it,
3955 2018-08-26 22:15:34 I think I’m going to make a kill shelf out of the bottles of olive oil I use up so that people know what I’m about
3956 2018-08-26 22:15:09 Have you tried cbd oil?
3957 2018-08-26 22:14:42 They live the life. My dog demands olive oil often. But the joke is on her, she's stuck in this madhouse with the rest of us
3958 2018-08-26 22:14:40 @gaywonk Can you contrast Algazeera's handling of panel debates? I just watched their panel on Guyana discovering oil and I noticed that when it gets unintelligible, the moderator stops the discussion cooling heads and changing the flow of the conversation. Better than CNN right?
3959 2018-08-26 22:14:27 I suspect it’s pretty much a wash on this road trip but, again, we don’t take many and I don’t have to spend any time at a gas station ever. So if you “value your time”, you might want to include your gas station time over the course of the entire year. (Plus oil changes, etc).
3960 2018-08-26 22:14:27 And you don’t use PALM OIL!

3962 2018-08-26 22:14:03 When oil was over $100/barrel we produced more than 3millions/day & it was like in 2012. Nowadays our production is below 1.4million/day
3963 2018-08-26 22:13:47 He’s a traitor. He’s a liar. He’s a racist pig. Sorry there isn’t one good thing about him. He’s trying to kill all environmental regs to benefit oil companies gas companies. His cabinet is a group of crooks robbing us blind. Wrecking the agencies they were placed to run.
3964 2018-08-26 22:13:35 The oil itself that we pop it in is vegan but theaters pop it with seasonings that are most likely not vegan (but you can always ask them too)

3969 2018-08-26 22:11:42 Coconut oil is poison. Dont eat the shit.
3970 2018-08-26 22:11:21 Not unpopular with me! This sort of misplaced 'environmentalism' is so destructive, I think it's deliberately funded by oil companies to defuse understanding of need for global switch to clean energy economy-wide, nothing less. Succeeded too.
3971 2018-08-26 22:11:21 Exactly!  I was driving uber when the oil and engine light started blinking red. I knew that was trouble. We had to walk on 95 almost a mile to the Cottman Ave exit

3987 2018-08-26 22:08:13 Be interesting to see what you think; I'm a bit squeamish and I'm no oil painting either so there's limited benefit! I try to keep hydrated and I haven't used soap on my face for decades, I think that helps a bit.
3988 2018-08-26 22:07:59 When I see how Qatar and Saudi Arabia are using their oil money  to transform their countries, I just sit back and ask my self if Nigeria is selling coconut or groundnut oil.

4000 2018-08-26 22:05:51 One time my dad made spaghetti and added palm oil and hot dogs and goat meat. From that point I knew.....
4001 2018-08-26 22:05:25 Lol I think in part because that little bit makes you feel great when compared to not exercising at all. I exercise to keep my muscles active and bone density up, not to lose weight.  There's so much ignorance in dieting I find and a ton of snake oil.
4002 2018-08-26 22:05:25 Let’s see....we have a liar and a criminal for a president. Our air and water are being polluted thanks to that crook’s deregulations. Our national parks are being given to the oil industry. They’ll be drilling offshore and in the arctic soon. Carbon dioxide levels are rising...
4003 2018-08-26 22:05:20 Dosed myself with some cbd oil.
4004 2018-08-26 22:05:12 Only to an extent, I think.
I have made an emulsion of EVOO & buttermilk to use on potato & rice salads - that added not just tang but also mouth feel.
Plain olive oil doesn't add a lot of oomph to potatoes, IMO. 
Now German potato salad...
4005 2018-08-26 22:05:11 What? Really? Multiple times? That's wild. One viewing and I had it down, it's Superman. I still think Aquaman sent the whales to save him in that oil rig scene.
4006 2018-08-26 22:05:07 In all honesty this is not a good review to cite. It’s written by people who work for a supplements company and, unsurprisingly, there is only discussion on supportive studies for fish oil supplements!
4007 2018-08-26 22:05:02 Midstream energy has a lot going for it between U.S. energy independence and increased oil/gas exports. Was moreso considered dead earlier this year but still a lot of runway ahead in my view.
4008 2018-08-26 22:04:47 I need an oil change like yesterday
4009 2018-08-26 22:04:38 Just because the freakiest thing you've done in your life is have sex with the lights on doesn't mean you should judge others for getting their oil checked while getting some sloppy top.
4010 2018-08-26 22:04:19 As a former Utahn who used Cannabis oil for medicinal purposes there should be 0 opposition. The amazing hemp plant has untold healing potential.

4018 2018-08-26 22:02:08 I don't expect that outcome realistically but the theme of my posts today has been to explore that possibility. Oil markets are like all highly connected markets today. Once momentum gets going to the downside, things can unravel quickly.

4029 2018-08-26 22:00:01 What's your other car? A car with an ICE using regular fuel would cost less than $205. For example, my turbo 2.0L gets 30-35mpg.
Sure there's no oil changes or tune ups, but what is the cost to replace a battery module with a finite number of charges. No word on the website.

4035 2018-08-26 21:59:25 All because I don't think the mechanic actually put the oil back in my car and I'm sure he blew my engine.
4036 2018-08-26 21:59:07 my mom put a small bottle of oil in the pocket of the door thing and it leaked and I didn't know, so now the speakers don't fcking work and shes literally saying its my fault??? like just don't touch my shit lmao im so fucking done

4047 2018-08-26 21:56:55 Shot dead? Nah....

File their teeth down to the nerves. Put 0.5amp on the nerves for a minute then slowly turn up the amps whilst making sure they’re not well earthed. As they approach death, stop. Then proceed to boil two buckets of cooking oil. Then deep fry their feet. Then..
4048 2018-08-26 21:56:51 The oil was quite the foe to get just right. But I have come out on top with Asian style crispy chicken tenders!!
4049 2018-08-26 21:56:36 But I do agree that as consumers we should educate mid/higher end to offer an entire seed oil free option. I think restaurant managers don’t see the market, because most of us give up, because seed oils in prep, and food, then only oil, we just stay at home and stop asking.

Cons to moisturizing daily: can’t turn doorknobs. I’ve been stuck in a room and haven’t seen outside in 2 weeks. Pls send help and coconut oil I may have an addiction
4055 2018-08-26 21:55:21 If Mr. President can also be the Minister of Petroleum....because of the importance of oil to Nigeria.

Yes in general the oil industry had a nice performance lately - and they pay very good dividends. But I´´m not topping up massively, because I´m not sure what´s going oin with E-mobility in the long run. But no panick sells either.

4077 2018-08-26 21:50:34 2 if we use less oil, Saudi and big oil produces wont be important, so no need to sell them guns,  Alas there is another world war coming it wont be over land or oil, it will be over fresh water and the rights to that water
4078 2018-08-26 21:50:32 We will still need oil after we stop using it as fuel .witch makes burning it even more stupid but we will still need to pump it out of the ground
4079 2018-08-26 21:50:26 Shell Oil Refinery in Holland Harvests CO2 that is then pumped to vast greenhouse complexes. The entire Dutch Greenhouse industry does this with Ge Jenbacher engines at places not on the Shell Refinery circuit.

4086 2018-08-26 21:49:30 Looked at this too quickly thinking it was an oil derrick and my brain didn’t doubt for a second that he sent her to Iraq to secure an oil field, wew
4087 2018-08-26 21:49:28 It's obvious of the success. But does his death excuse the scam oil kickbacks from Saudi Arabia. IRS? but most recently the uranium one, democratic funded dirty dossier. That he was involved in. And him marching it to the white house!

4091 2018-08-26 21:49:06 Day 2 update: The dolmades are amazing. Also the Greek salads are great, although they really should just call them salads here, same goes for the yoghurt & olive oil.

4093 2018-08-26 21:48:50 It would be huge except that politicians ignore such data when it conflicts with political donations from potentially impacted companies. Here it would be oil and gas. Regarding wide support for gun regs, it's the NRA.
4094 2018-08-26 21:48:21 @positiveMantra for those doubting the great work PMB has done & still doing, let Venezuela be their case study. They are also oil depended nation, recession hit them like us but yet to recover rather is getting worse. Peru, Brazil, Colombia et al are my witness. Kudos PMB

4101 2018-08-26 21:47:17 Even if The Pope comes to rules Nigeria today, as long as oil prices remain very low and we keep depending on oil, hardship will continue its as simple as that, most of you don’t get it... Nigeria has been depending on oil, and oil price is at a very low and is determined by OPEC
4102 2018-08-26 21:47:03 @AriShaffir so I’m sure suggestions have been pouring in since @bertkreischer made your rhoidal situation public... but have you tried turmeric mixed mustard oil yet? I don’t usually subscribe to eastern medicine but it worked better for me than 2 surgeries.
4103 2018-08-26 21:47:01 Nope.nope. nope. Sealed. Voted for trump he would unmask the snake oil salesman
4104 2018-08-26 21:46:59 So I had my oil changed, like I always do, at @Nissan but my service engine soon light came on, I had a mechanic check my oil and he said it was so dirty and asked when was the last time I got my oil changed. Weird because you’re supposed to change your oil every 3000 miles...
4105 2018-08-26 21:46:58 ICE require oil changes and have many moving parts destined to fail.

4110 2018-08-26 21:45:20 Who said something about oil bitch you cooking
4111 2018-08-26 21:45:20 I like it: in a salad with grated cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, topped with broiled chicken, pistachios, and poppy seed dressing; broiled on its own brushed with olive oil and salt; or mixed in a protein shake with blueberries, etc.
4112 2018-08-26 21:44:59 TIL how people accidentally burn their houses down frying turkeys. The house is fine, but smoky.  Apparently the smoke point of peanut oil & flame point of peanut oil are close. Props to my husband for knowing what to do. Note to self:  Turn the burner off, then pee.

4125 2018-08-26 21:43:51 I had to listen to the total shit spouting from his fat gob during the Indi ref, how we would all benefit from billions of pounds from an independent oil industry. Then it collapsed 1 year post indi, with massive job losses and revenues bottoming out. Hope he gets jailed.

4128 2018-08-26 21:43:43 If I leave conditioner in my hair, it will be a greasy mess. I put coconut oil at the ends of my hair to help seal in the moisture and prevent split ends
4129 2018-08-26 21:43:27 Y’all brushing dry ass hair is not creating waves, the ocean which has waves is wet, put some moisturizer or oil on ya scalp  brushing sounding like you’re racking concrete

4132 2018-08-26 21:43:15 Not the director but had to go through lineup/pit stops for the end of the stage. We were close to green then found more oil on the track. Hope ya enjoyed the race tho 
4133 2018-08-26 21:43:11 I need to find an oil blend that is good for headaches. Something small and portable because I’m getting them so much now.
4134 2018-08-26 21:43:08 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to the Japanese. Either that, or put it on eBay

4137 2018-08-26 21:42:47 Houston is an oil town and @GovAbbott denies man made global warming. Don’t believe him. He’ll offer his hollow thoughts and prayers, ask for money and repeat his bs every year until Texas votes his ass out!

4140 2018-08-26 21:42:28 Lemongrass essential oil smells horrific.
4141 2018-08-26 21:42:20 Any cleanup will be deducted from the cost oil ( the cost to produce the oil). This will decrease the governments’ share.

4144 2018-08-26 21:42:01 This was the spicy one, Jo. Tiny slivers of green chillies in the hummus. And fresh olive oil. The perfect consistency and taste. Just awesome.
4145 2018-08-26 21:41:52 ESPN never got it. Sports and politics never mix. It's like oil and vinegar.
4146 2018-08-26 21:41:51 Use a glass bowl and peanut oil. Then drive them across town and dump em out
4147 2018-08-26 21:41:30 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4148 2018-08-26 21:41:29 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4150 2018-08-26 21:41:24 tomorrow i have a big geography exam about oil and i wanna die, say something
4151 2018-08-26 21:40:50 Great fracture my ankle then 2 days later my car starts leaking oil. What fucking next.

4154 2018-08-26 21:40:39 Khodorkovsy had done that with Yukos oil company. Financial Times reporter Tom Catan wrote about Khodorkovsky's Yukos oil transfer-pricing corruption. He was moved off that beat. Left the paper. MSM doesn't want these stories.

4161 2018-08-26 21:40:17 How are they going to up charge you if your not around?

4166 2018-08-26 21:39:28 White guys are just going to keep killing us. From the president to the oil executive to the arms manufacturers to the poor asshole who goes crazy from losing a video game.
4167 2018-08-26 21:39:18 My go to lately has been making a salty smoked paprika paste with good oil, coating a bunch of pecans with it, and baking those little fuckers.
4168 2018-08-26 21:39:18 Oil is a good sub
4169 2018-08-26 21:38:47 The West needs to stop purchasing oil from murderous dictators. Canada  spends $300 million/month on Saudi crude. This is not a right and left issue - Canadians would vote to stop giving ‘Saudi Wahhabi’ our taxpayer money if we had a vote. #cdnpoli #saudioilbegone
4170 2018-08-26 21:38:40 @realDonaldTrump we should have taken the oil. He’s doing what he said he would do if elected.

4173 2018-08-26 21:37:42 Most likely since Ferrari uses crappy #Shell gas (lower octane) they compensate with burning more oil in the mixture.
4174 2018-08-26 21:37:37 i think its better just to eat avocado oil instead

4176 2018-08-26 21:37:11 Iran and Venezuela didn't do what china did, which is produce goods to export. Iran had oil but we know what happens if you have resources and lack of leadership and governance! Very close parallels to SA, which is why we need to fix governance. But we shouldn't be afraid!
4177 2018-08-26 21:37:00 Let's not forget what it took to score 20% OF URANIUM, from US. 
The EU is making Russia rich buying gas & oil from them and we are helping them build more boms to use against all. And we are paying like fools the lion share of the NATO budget. #Trump is changing that. #WalkAway
4178 2018-08-26 21:36:56 That would be nice. But do either one of you know the oil and gas industry, an Obama alternative, is doing the same thing in the northern part of West Virginia as the coal industry did in the southern coal fields.
4179 2018-08-26 21:36:51 Looks yummy. I'd love to make oil from it
4180 2018-08-26 21:36:44 Went to get my oil changed. The guy asked me to pop the hood and I popped the trunk  #yikes

4185 2018-08-26 21:36:10 A brightening facial mask, sultry purple, with lavender, tea tree oil, and exfoliating coconut fiber. The bottle it comes in is cut-glass.

4189 2018-08-26 21:35:31 They are different words, no wonder you’re confused. Also you still haven’t told me what entitlement means. Also your taxes pay for soldiers income, cops, our representatives, researchers, scientists, teachers, etc. We subsidize the income of oil companies, pharma, utilities...

4194 2018-08-26 21:34:29 The reason the world currency is USD has nothing to do with Oil, it’s because of the stable value of the USD.
4195 2018-08-26 21:34:15 This is an excellent initiative & can also raise export market for olives & olive oil, just like Spain
4196 2018-08-26 21:34:11 Was at a restaurant. Asked the waitress what oil was used to make the french fries.  She wasn’t sure but said that for sure no peanut oil since peanut allergies are common now.  No more restaurant fries 4 me.  Rather eat a bkd potato. Take the carbs w butter, lose the seed oil.

4204 2018-08-26 21:32:55 As great as that sounds, it doesn’t really make sense. Extracting oil is so complex that no one should get a discount.
4205 2018-08-26 21:32:33 Indeed, and it's major asset is oil, denominated in USD

4210 2018-08-26 21:31:49 Done with the first of many sessions LISTENING to my novel.  Now it's time to do some home projects: install new toilet seats, change my Impreza's oil, wash my car, vaccume and treat its leather seats.  #beerneeded
4211 2018-08-26 21:30:55 Yeah. I recently tried acrylics after a long hiatus using only gouache and the odd oil painting and it dries so fast and feels almost chunky!
4212 2018-08-26 21:30:52 I think we have to ask why oily fish has proven protective again and again in epidemiological studies but fish oil supplements have not. 
Any insights?

4222 2018-08-26 21:30:05 Smash back and forth between my hands to compact, then roll, then chill, then shallow fry with a lot of oil on a high heat. The balls may benefit from being mishapen (mine end up as an icosahedron) as they achieve a greater surface area with the pan and therefore brown better.

4237 2018-08-26 21:27:22 ("they" meaning big oil execs, to be clear, have that blind spot, due to their misogyny and alienation of women) oil is all about the scarcity mindset, and the dominance and authority complex. Truth and egalitarianism are their enemy... </rant>
4238 2018-08-26 21:27:08 We all know grifters were built in northern shipyard from oil rig offcuts and then the tubes filled with concrete. So heavy the friggers actually generated their own gravity and bent time
4239 2018-08-26 21:26:57 Just figured out that porn, dirty oil is related to people who stay up late then get up late, come late to work, cheat, lie, gossip, steal others work,steal others credit, push on other coworkers,abuse women by taking pictures showing them almost nude in public

4245 2018-08-26 21:25:02 No worries. Oil is used for far more than petro.

Pushing out Christians

4263 2018-08-26 21:22:17 I read an article about nonbiogenic oil years ago, was intrigued, then happened to run into a (female) Phd with the requisite knowledge on the subject and she quickly disabused me of the idea.  In my expernce the avg woman just doesn't engage much on science, politics writ large
4264 2018-08-26 21:22:13 People like Reno should have been stoned with his Boss who squandered more than S300 billion oil revenues.

4269 2018-08-26 21:21:43 The Republican Party must disassociate itself from the international

4273 2018-08-26 21:20:47 What I found helped a lot with eggs was that I was unaware that you should heat the pan up before you even put any oil or butter into it to help them not stick. Also, butter seems better for cooking them in than olive oil.

4281 2018-08-26 21:19:36 I did not know I needed bread dipped in blood orange olive oil and balsamic vinegar until today. It was soooo good 
4282 2018-08-26 21:19:29 It is quite good. Flour, yeast, water, eggs, oil, salt. Buttered tins sprinkled with cornmeal. It’s so easy to slice and toast. (Too easy... ) But very difficult to find real tins as most coffee comes in sacks or plastic now.  So I am hoarding the three I still have.
4283 2018-08-26 21:19:28 "Ghanaian" stop making a mockery of the money used in getting you a quota to school.

4291 2018-08-26 21:18:20 I think I tried just about everything. Ice pack on forehead. Heating pad on neck. Feet immersed in ice water. Japanese mint oil pretty much everywhere. Gravol. Claritin, robaxacet, naproxen, torodol. It was dug in and told to to go fuck myself
4292 2018-08-26 21:18:15 It’s almond butter, coconut oil & flour, and cocoa powder. It’s lit
4293 2018-08-26 21:18:04 4 ...on oil, which came crashing down, dragging parts of the economy with it. All in all a pretty lousy day’s work for a self-anointed “economist”. Trudeau has yet to borrow in total the equal of Harper’s single biggest year, and at rates so low...

4296 2018-08-26 21:17:14 There are ministerial positions that can be 'dashed' out NOT EDUCATION, NOT TECHNOLOGY, NOT YOUTH!!!

The palm FRUIT oil I've seen (rarely) looks lovely, it's a kind of sorbet red, and I would SUPPOSE that's the one that's better for us?

4364 2018-08-26 21:05:53 @JMLMANGOANDLIME moisture is key. My favorite is a hot oil treatment every two weeks with the lavender Jamaican Black castor oil!
4365 2018-08-26 21:05:47 Thank you
4366 2018-08-26 21:05:40 (thanks to oil reserves and Western engineers)
4367 2018-08-26 21:05:33 Sure, the u.s. destroying another country over oil sounds fair. Until they want something you have and don't want to pay a fair price for it.

4373 2018-08-26 21:04:32 Very interesting. I think it’s a valid insight in that it gives Trump many ways out. The markets crashing, oil shooting up. I think that’s realistic
4374 2018-08-26 21:04:08 i bought the probiotic cleanser and pomegranate oil from your blog post.
4375 2018-08-26 21:04:05 We love you and the Sims that you create! We are one big Sim happy family over here which always reminds me how "Oil Tot's" slogan should be "Bringing People Together". Awesome tree "Oil Tot"!

4379 2018-08-26 21:03:11 The garden is providing plenty of tomatoes, and I had some fresh mozzarella in the fridge, so I made some Caprese. What more do you need? Didn't have any fresh basil so I dressed with a little salt, pepper, olive oil, and balsamic. YUM.
4380 2018-08-26 21:03:10 @kissmyfaceUSA Thanks so much for having gluten free products, as well as almond free. I read you removed almond oil a few years ago so thank you! I’m new to being almond allergic so you guys rock!

4431 2018-08-26 20:56:08 @checkupcbc I love Local Hero, about a Scottish Coastal village that an oil company wanted to buy to build an oil refinery. Magical with music by Mark Knoffler. I went over and visited the village (Furness in the movie, Pennan in real life.) Still holds up today.
4432 2018-08-26 20:55:39 Makes me think of those years of Peak Oil predictions.

4435 2018-08-26 20:55:19 I got my oil changed and the guy offered to do it for free if I left him a positive yelp review. Idk if this is desperate, creative or creepy but after I did it he found my review and direct messages me on YELP his phone number hitting on me... I’ve never been hit on thru yelp.
4436 2018-08-26 20:55:14 Glad that was the reason, rather than after that horrific ADP thing that hung off Ptarmigan. Although at $1.5M a station it was a snake oil salesman’s dream.

4438 2018-08-26 20:54:43 Just asked the question that's all, oil is never mentioned or the countries that produce it, I don't expect you or any one else to do anything for me, Did I say i wanted oil banned :No, If you are part of Adam's PR team maybe you can answer the question.
4439 2018-08-26 20:54:32 Snake oil salesman and the stupid have always coexisted. This is nothing new. It’s just that everyone can hear every single one of them on their social megaphone now
4440 2018-08-26 20:54:31 Oil was sold by Saudi etc at a huge loss for a long period. If you put a competitor company out of business using that Capitalist method you gain market share. Do it to countries you starve millions of children.
It's just evil Capitalism doing its thing.
4441 2018-08-26 20:54:20 When you have red hair, everyone remembers you: the guys who changed your oil once every 3 months, the store employee who immediately asked where I’d been the past two months, the sushi preparer in a Brooksville publix you see once in a blue moon, etc.

Bad news: the sun roof was open
4453 2018-08-26 20:52:51 The oil was sold below market price by Saudi etc in 2014. You don't take a huge hit for no reason. It lead to starving children in Venezuela. Nice Capitalism eh.
4454 2018-08-26 20:52:43 What are they covered in, engine oil?
4455 2018-08-26 20:52:43 Except for in Texas we CANT complete a major oil pipeline because you jacked up the costs for steel?
4456 2018-08-26 20:52:40 They don’t actually care about the dead—this farce is just another opportunity for them to push their bull. Nothing else matters to these snake oil salesmen.
4457 2018-08-26 20:52:36 Yet police still murder people and inequality is everpresent . Not to mention our infrastructure is crumbling and if they put in the Shell oil Cracker Plant in monaca , our air will be even more polluted . So . Idk where they pull their stats from
4458 2018-08-26 20:52:27 Read better newspapers and watch channels that aren't based in the UK. Remember, our press is 33rd out of 33 for trustworthiness, and there are an awful lot of liars with swollen egos who've been selling you snake oil for more than ten years.

4460 2018-08-26 20:52:05 I could never be convinced that coconut oil is bad. It has worked wonders for me. #FuckBigPharma
4461 2018-08-26 20:52:02 There are villages near me where there are tied farm workers houses that rely on open solid fuel fires, coal or logs. No central heating. No gas supply. Oil is too expensive. Logs are expensive now that log burners are popular. It can get very cold in winter.
4462 2018-08-26 20:51:53 I will smudge, bring essential oil & my rattle.
4463 2018-08-26 20:51:53 Olive oil is not a seed oil and it's mostly monounsaturated.  I think the OP is talking about seed oils rich in linoleic acid.
4464 2018-08-26 20:51:51 Nigeria has been so much used to oil that we plan its Production & Price but what plan does Nigeria have for EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY, YOUTHS?

A country continues in a state of rest or uniform motion unless there is a disruption....

If we don't change, we can't change!
4465 2018-08-26 20:51:42 They are trying like hell to drill anywhere they can. I also lived in NOLA, my Dads final orders before his retirement (XO NSA NOLA). Offshore oil drilling I know well. However, BP Horizon exposed what the true plans are for that region, which is build refineries. Sad to see..
4466 2018-08-26 20:51:36 In 2014 several countries sold oil well below below market rate to kill off competitors.
They knew competitors were not companies but countries with children who would likely starve en masse.
That is Capitalism in an evil form.
You might call it competition.
4467 2018-08-26 20:51:34 Ah... a twofer. Product is naturally gluten-free (corn, oil, salt) but manufacturing makes it susceptible to contamination. Marketing moves so much faster than labeling regulation... one makes money, one has potential to improve lives.
4468 2018-08-26 20:51:30 Next time I’m take chance of changing my own oil. Save money
4469 2018-08-26 20:51:27 castor oil
4470 2018-08-26 20:51:23 Also coconut oil is really good for your skin.
4471 2018-08-26 20:50:54 I'd ask them if they honestly believe that blocking this line, or shutting in Canadian oil production, will cause any less oil to be burned worldwide. That's supply-side environmentalism, and it's as dubious as supply-side economics.
4472 2018-08-26 20:50:33 Didn’t go anywhere yesterday so my durag stayed on....lemme take it off, let my hair breathe and oil it some more
4473 2018-08-26 20:50:31 
Lesson is whether you drink the whole atlantic Ocean or mix lime and small stout or drink engine oil, you will only end up with a stomach upset/poisoning/intoxication/vomiting/diarrhea etc...but they cannot prevent pregnancy.
Study @DrOlufunmilayo's thread. 
Be informed.

4479 2018-08-26 20:48:45 Oil was sold by several States below market price for a sustained period in 2014. It was done so for 1 reason. To cripple competitors.
It's what Capitalism does.
Children are now starving in Venezuela after their oil economy tanked under the pressure.
That's evil.
4480 2018-08-26 20:48:34 Hamiln’s Wizard Oil contained camphor, ammonia, chloroform, sassafras, cloves, and turpentine.  50%-70% alcohol.  Waiting for the Trump Administration to give it the green light.
4481 2018-08-26 20:48:32 As I say - somewhat simplistic - especially as many oil producers also have solar energy plant developments too. I think we need to invent table top nuclear fission!! Haha
4482 2018-08-26 20:48:25 Chavez killed Venezuela's oil biz when he kicked the international oil conglomerates out of their contracts, so as to retain more of the profits for his people. It didn't work. He lost the expertise and opened up avenues of corruption.

4486 2018-08-26 20:47:59 Did you just google it because a minute ago, you’re not even aware of FOTCO? Do u even understand how upstream to downstream oil works? It’s not just a jetty. It’s an oil terminal which involves same amount of expertise as running a refinery except prod. WTF You’re on about PARCO
4487 2018-08-26 20:47:55 1. FOTCO is not FWO

4489 2018-08-26 20:47:45 I pay 12 cents/kWh all up in MD.  Even if the car “only” achieves 84mpgE it’s still FAR cheaper to operate than any ICE vehicle no?  Assume you need to put 60Kwh in the car at 12c/kWh that’s a $7 fill up...a 50mpg Prius needs $3/gallon gas AND oil changes AND it’s slow as hell 
4490 2018-08-26 20:47:38 Yeah 18-110 lens....wanna buy one?  It’s not a ob doc camera. It has it’s place but for beauty.

4491 2018-08-26 20:47:34 just remember guys a prominent person in the esports community recently supported a snake oil salesman who directly attempted to profit from previous shootings.

but yeah remain apolitical. and keep giving these guys work.

4498 2018-08-26 20:46:28 There has to be a conspiracy between politics, oil and religion. 
It's not natural the relationship, it looks far off but more plausible than imagined.
4499 2018-08-26 20:46:28 Not to mention that EVs don’t often require brake pad replacement nor tuneups or oil changes or not fuel filters or gas additives or anything.  The net operating cost is much lower than gas vehicles.  And the experience is better.
4500 2018-08-26 20:46:24 So rich in oil and other resources
4501 2018-08-26 20:46:23 The output was good in terms of kilograms but however we still falling short in terms of our yield per hectare which means we need to empower these farmers to improve our quality. Lastly oil companies you need to come up with facility for soya bean lets do import substitution.

4512 2018-08-26 20:44:19 sprouts , Walmart , whole foods, Walgreens. Just about any pharmacy place , it's some vitamins . Get you a good moisturizer that your hair likes ( I use cantu) and a oil to seal your waves and moisture in . (olive oil, coconut oil , argon oil etc.)
4513 2018-08-26 20:44:16 what the Fuck is truffle oil.. u use that for a car or some shit??
4514 2018-08-26 20:43:50 This is Thai but way yummy. Red curry paste, coconut milk, a dash or two of fish sauce, lime zest and palm or brown sugar to taste.  
For Indian use curry paste or mix curry powder with a neutral oil and toast it in the pan a bit, omit the fish sauce...
4515 2018-08-26 20:43:43 Fr carmax , chap ice , Vaseline , cooking oil  like something
4516 2018-08-26 20:43:34 Actually, US capitalism had low or no effect on the Venezuelan economy.  Venezuela had great infrastructure, and their trade deficit was low because of the rich soil and deposits they had.  Once they discovered oil reserves, they stopped producing almost anything locally.

4525 2018-08-26 20:42:21 I'm talking about the desperate need for pipelines to feed an ever-growing demand that is constantly thwarted by enviro-terrorists who use more energy than anyone

4639 2018-08-26 20:24:15 @POTUS @VP will The USA allow a North Korea state in the Caribbean with Oil rich resources access to the Atlantic? Will the USA allow a massive exodus in their front yard? Will the US be so blind as to allow these criminal enterprises to become an existential threat?

4641 2018-08-26 20:24:08 Oof would you be ok with adding the Oil tanker text from S6?
4642 2018-08-26 20:24:06 My local mall: Sternly written warning on the doors and a handful of unarmed rent-a-cops is all they have.

Which is pointless: People who ignore "thou shalt not murder" aren't going to suddenly find "no weapons allowed" as sacrosanct.
4643 2018-08-26 20:24:02 You’re another snake oil salesman playing on the fears and doubts and insecurities of ignorant people just like Donald Trump.  The US is not for SOME people, it’s for EVERY person as immigrants from many countries have come here for 250 years.  Trump and Loomer want to divide USA
4644 2018-08-26 20:23:36 I acknowledge your success,mr president,congratulations,now how about your countries involvement with the Saudis..?keep oil prices sweet,because they can open taps quicker  than Xmas,yet kids are killed in Yemen,with us supplied ordinance,fighters.A dirty war.,to be sure
4645 2018-08-26 20:23:30 Castor oil is my savior. I had bad dandruff. Couldn’t tell cause my hair is too thick but deep down I did come to find out. Castor oil fixed it real quick. Don’t over do it.
4646 2018-08-26 20:23:24 I just wanna rub oil on her thighs and booty
4647 2018-08-26 20:23:22 All this talk about virgin and extra virgin...

What about hoe olive oil?
Some hussy olive oil?
Been around the block and back olive oil?
4648 2018-08-26 20:23:19 Taking a game this seriously didnt warp this person's mind at all? Sort of lends credibility to idea what people see, read or watch does influence their actions though content producers deny this.

4651 2018-08-26 20:22:56 Husband changed the oil in all the vehicles today and gave ‘em a wash. Me, I did laundry and made a homie meal topped off with homemade banana ice cream. This is us. Not glamorous, not fancy, just #EuAnna. #Sunday
4652 2018-08-26 20:22:56 Good times...wait till the sh&$ hits the fan in November and oil sanctions kick in
4653 2018-08-26 20:22:52 No, thanks to the unparalleled wealth generating capacity of capitalism. In socialist Venezuela, my friend, oil is still exported to the US (Venezuela’s biggest trading partner) but the people starve. Only an economy planned by socialists can achieve this.
4654 2018-08-26 20:22:34 Evidence, You can’t supplement your way out of a soybean oil diet. Just remove the omega 6. Poof- no need for omega 3.
4655 2018-08-26 20:22:27 5 seconds ago, big oil was denying that climate change was happening... Now they see dollar signs.
4656 2018-08-26 20:22:15 Heard of it going into dairy operations and feedlots for bedding, high oil straw should shed the moisture.

4658 2018-08-26 20:22:08 This yellow is too long. Where’s the red flag? With oil all the way around maybe they should have red flagged the race. Just in a hurry to use up laps, I guess
4659 2018-08-26 20:22:02 Will Brent exceed $80/b in September?

4661 2018-08-26 20:21:29 Good idea. Possibly re-purpose the pipelines that are now used for oil and gas? (okay, oil pipelines need serious cleaning).

4663 2018-08-26 20:20:59 If you're talking about Keystone XL, it's CANADIAN oil going to be EXPORTED. Very little, if any, benefit whatsoever to US after it's been built. There have been PLENTY of wage increases before Trump. I got a lot of them, nearly every year, in fact. Sorry you missed out.

4667 2018-08-26 20:20:17 Nothing special! Lotta garlic and olive oil, cooked until golden, add a lot of onion and a cut up bell pepper, then add a fair bit of cumin and smoked paprika. Stir while cooking until they soften. Add canned garbanzos and cook until most of the water evaporates: Liquid => creamy

4669 2018-08-26 20:20:00 The MARKET will decide when coal is no longer cost-efficient.  And, logically solar and wind, in their current forms, are episodic, dependent upon sun and wind, and backup power from coal, oil, natural gas, will be required for the foreseeable future.

4673 2018-08-26 20:19:12 I appreciate these studies, and you're reporting the appropriate statistics therein. A question re olive oil as a placebo:  could it have benefits of its own?  Has that been studied? (Mediterranean diet touts it: I understand that's probably anecdotal, not proven.)

4691 2018-08-26 20:16:47 Yesssss! So pleased  such a good episode. Do want it to be an oil painting next though. Something a bit more meaty!

4701 2018-08-26 20:15:02 Look up eminent domain laws. It basically means the the Fed Gov can just take land at anytime. It’s scary, but what if it wasn’t just for oil pipelines and freeways
4702 2018-08-26 20:14:57 really mad I can't drive to school tomorrow since my car wanna LACK OIL AND CRAP
4703 2018-08-26 20:14:42 Wee need infrastructure put in place first focus on diversifying our economy industrial revolution can occur through mining oil included & agriculture bt wee need first to open up our country the northern parts are way behind we need them also to contribute to the economy as well

I’m also super sweaty bc I’ve been airing out rooms one by one by putting a candle and incense or oil, opening the window, turning a fan on high, and closing the door. It’s amazing and is totally worth it.

(And yet the hair closest to my face is unrepentantly immune to any treatment. SETTLE DOWN)
4709 2018-08-26 20:14:02 Did u get some oil into it?
4710 2018-08-26 20:13:58 Yes, exactly. Is there security there? There had to be some system in place?
4711 2018-08-26 20:13:58 We can’t eat our cake and have it, it’s just like d story in the Bible,pharaohs dream,Joseph interpreted and they prepared for famine saving bountiful food, today the oil we depend on is at a very low, of all opec nations we are feeling it at worse because no savings to hold side
4712 2018-08-26 20:13:51 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow. Thanks!

4715 2018-08-26 20:13:15 The biggest difference between Reagan and Trump is that Reagan helped Americans feel happy and shiny about war, imperialism, racism and class warfare, while Trump makes Americans feel like they’re covered in cooking oil with no way to ever remove it.
4716 2018-08-26 20:12:56 If R-IT is successful, this recent study could finally put to rest that fish oil helps your cardiovascular. That in turn could make supplements less attractive and Vasepa much more attractive=bigger sales.

4719 2018-08-26 20:12:32 Regulations are already in place, the biggest challenge is the cost of cleaning the damaged oilfield environment is the fact that the govt is a shareholder in the oil companies.
4720 2018-08-26 20:12:17 Just because?
4721 2018-08-26 20:12:17 Yes! I rode <4 km 2 yrs ago &slipped on some oil, in the wet, whilst going around a corner. I banged my head, hard, my helmet had 4 cracks in it. Black eye but would have been worse without a helmet. I’d made that journey all summer, often without a helmet previously #wearahelmet

4734 2018-08-26 20:10:24 Idk if this helps since I assume it's hard to tell who produced the palm oil in the products, and just because one plant gets a sustainable certification while not destroying habitats doesn't mean others don't either?
4735 2018-08-26 20:10:23 It’s cannabis oil
4736 2018-08-26 20:10:18 because they dont own it & have no rights to manage/decide as they wish something which is not theirs. u think they seek peace n dont pretend they want the oil/gas beneath it?

4743 2018-08-26 20:09:13 She’s moisture coconut and hibiscus is ass too even for ppl with looser textures. The formula there has also been changed. The Jamaican castor oil line last I used it (2016) it was still great and healed my colored damaged hair
4744 2018-08-26 20:09:11 i suggest to lay down and do some relaxing massage with warm olive oil and it will reliefe the back immediately
4745 2018-08-26 20:09:06 Not talked aboute enough: in same week, Elonk taking Tesla private with Saudi money is scuttled, as is Saudi royal family plans to IPO national oil giant Aramco.
4746 2018-08-26 20:08:56 Who’s going to pay for it. Small business is thriving again driving down unemployment for everyone. Your a snake oil salesmen with nothing to offer other than the same old worn out failed democratic promises from the past. Move along
4747 2018-08-26 20:08:42 I have very little experience on this topic, but I visited a palm oil plantation in the Solomon islands (which is sustainable certified) and it was in what was previously knee-high grassland - so not destroying a rainforest (plus there are no orangutans in the Solomons)
4748 2018-08-26 20:08:40 And you support the politicians that support our dependency on oil and send Americans into harm's way to fight over it. SMDH.

4752 2018-08-26 20:08:01 Its not hard i just seasoned and the shrimp added balsalmic vinegar let it sit overnight ... added onions and asparagus a lil olive oil and a lil balsamic vinegar (the juice from the shrimp should be enough)  and once it was done  add a lil honey. Quick and easy
4753 2018-08-26 20:07:50 They are really good drizzled in olive oil and balsamic vinegar and grilled. That’s the only way I really like them.

4756 2018-08-26 20:07:31 Yuppers!! Tis normal indeed!! My 1978 Mercury Cougar oil pressure gauge did the same. Looks like ya need gas  though heehee
4757 2018-08-26 20:07:03 No, the real thing. It doesn’t work without the THC in it. You need oil from cannabis plant not the kind from Hemp. There is a big difference. The CBD oil, you might as well drink water.
4758 2018-08-26 20:06:51 Minimum wage stability is why young people, teenagers, are now able to find jobs.  You would not wish to price them out of the market would you?  I know of nobody drilling oil in a national park.  Profit is not a 4-letter word.  Without it, nothing much gets done.  Trump cares...
4759 2018-08-26 20:06:48 I use peppermint oil diluted in vodka (a little party for the critters )
Does vinegar work better?
4760 2018-08-26 20:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
4761 2018-08-26 20:06:36 At night I used the Pixi rose oil and then put a sleeping pack on top, let it soak into my skin for at least 20mins before going to bed so it doesn't end up on my pillow. I used Too Cool For School pumpkin sleeping pack which was amazing, now trying LIOELE's V-Line Sleeping Pack
4762 2018-08-26 20:06:33 •  Coconut oil:  Thoroughly  massage around 3 to 5 tablespoons  of  coconut oil  onto your  scalp an  hour before showering.20 This   treatment not only  helps you  be  dandruff-free but also keeps your   hair smelling good.
4763 2018-08-26 20:06:32 Oil, I see.
4764 2018-08-26 20:06:26 It is unknown if the Ratooey ever actually visited the ruins on his quest for oil.
4765 2018-08-26 20:06:17 coconut oil! just a few drops on your face and lips before sleeping do wonders to my dry skin (make sure to spread the drops and massage you face)
4766 2018-08-26 20:06:14 is it rude to squirt CBD oil in my dads mouth while he’s talking?
4767 2018-08-26 20:06:12 • Tea tree  oil: Using tea tree oil for treating  dandruff is quick  and  easy. Simply  massage a few drops of tea tree oil  onto your scalp  to  reduce  itchiness and excessive oil production.19 You  may also mix a  few drops  of this oil in your shampoo
4768 2018-08-26 20:06:06 The same nonsense is promoted around the world. Coconut oil and ghee are actually very healthy. The low fat, high carb diet is killing people.

4771 2018-08-26 20:05:39 Where does London get their oil ? I am anti war, but that doesn’t mean I hate the soldiers for doing what they do. Being a 1st world country we need a good military.
4772 2018-08-26 20:05:38 You really love used car and snake oil salesmen!!
4773 2018-08-26 20:05:30 CBD oil 
4774 2018-08-26 20:05:24 How do they not understand that criminals are not going to obey gun laws??
4775 2018-08-26 20:05:22 This is our fault... apparently.
My guns still haven't shot anyone.
4776 2018-08-26 20:05:12 I can’t smoke or consume. I used to but I forget what doing can’t sleep I hate it. CBD OIL works I use when have it
4777 2018-08-26 20:05:09 Unfortunately, I’ve been exposed to that snake oil salesman since the 70s. He’s always been a turd in the punch bowl. His divorce from Ivana was his most entertaining moment. He’s just a monstrous pile of dinosaur dung.
4778 2018-08-26 20:05:06 I thought maybe "dics" was an abbreviation for an oil or fat!
4779 2018-08-26 20:04:59 Hopefully that will help limit our dependence on foreign oil as well. Good luck, Mr. President!
4780 2018-08-26 20:04:56 The weather changes sure can cause troubles i hope ya feel better supergirl Susan Pearson!The oil do help too!Try to stay positive and creative!
4781 2018-08-26 20:04:53 In reflection of McCain, I remember when Obama laughed at the notion of America could be self sufficient in oil in 8 years if we just drill baby drill.  It was a joke to the Dems.  Eight years later, guess what, the joke is on the Dems and America is talking about exporting oil.
4782 2018-08-26 20:04:39 I use Oil of Olay for my face.
4783 2018-08-26 20:04:36 OK most of my Sunday is dun, changed oil&oil filter in car, replaced spark plugs, air filter even rear brake shoes also cleaned inside, washed also waxed car now only thing left is laundry even cleaning room&bath room!

4785 2018-08-26 20:04:22 rose hip oil is one of my favorites
4786 2018-08-26 20:04:21 If there's that much oil, why is this race not red-flagged?  #Silverado250
4787 2018-08-26 20:04:12 And where does Rafael get his money? Big oil? Corporations? Koch brothers? Mercers? Is that any better?
4788 2018-08-26 20:04:05 come to the grand opening of my new tweet store October 8th 1800 Burrard St. Will be serving olive oil in cups

4790 2018-08-26 20:03:45 Gun grabbers go into full attack mode before families even notified.  Classy

4792 2018-08-26 20:03:40 Pit lane is closed due to a oil spill. @CTMPOfficial @NASCAR_Trucks
4793 2018-08-26 20:03:37 ALEC probably had the bills written already. Big oil is all up in ALEC. Scary to think 28 States are signed on for an Article 5. 6 more and they get their Constitutional Convention. Word is they have the repeal of the 17th ready as well as Amendments returning pwr to States.
4794 2018-08-26 20:03:36 Most Indian restaurants are run by Pakistani’s or Bangladeshi people & therefore they will use #Halal. 
Only exceptions are restaurants run by Sikh people. For them it’s forbidden to use Halal
Even vegetarian dishes are cooked in halal certified oil.

4795 2018-08-26 20:03:27 It would be that they are burning too much oil/octane boosters in the combustion cycle which will increase the output of the power unit.
4796 2018-08-26 20:03:18 It is quite incredible that people find this so difficult.  No financial credibility when oil price was >$110 so now..........   there are no magic beans young man and is this is not a game.  We have to be responsible for the sakes of future generations.    #justsaying
4797 2018-08-26 20:03:16 If you have anxiety, I highly recommend taking CBD oil. It has helped me tremendously 
4798 2018-08-26 20:03:12 How is Venezuela doing with Oil wealth lifting people out of poverty????
4799 2018-08-26 20:03:01 if y'all ever want your hair to grow fast try hemp oil it's literally magic
4800 2018-08-26 20:02:57 A well regulated militia has nothing to do with regulating weapons. .thee is no law that would prevent this. These oil dint follow the bighestblaw of all. No murder.
4801 2018-08-26 20:02:53 Hmmm I only have the oil cloths that are on the table now and a Christmas one. So I’m all good
4802 2018-08-26 20:02:52 Pit road still closed as they clean up oil
4803 2018-08-26 20:02:40 I agree with you that it might not be the first time but then we know the past 16years was soaked in corruption, I encourage you to spread the good news and be optimistic. We are out of recession and now we are trying to reduce the economy from depending on oil alone
4804 2018-08-26 20:02:29 Big oil can afford to do its own protecting. Besides, they’re expressly endorsing the consequences of global warming, to which their own product, in large part, was responsible for.
4805 2018-08-26 20:02:05 I almost choked to death on one of them fish oil bitches
4806 2018-08-26 20:02:02 How bout we just invest in solar and not have to worry about their stupid oil spills every few months
4807 2018-08-26 20:01:56 Hey girl!! Try coconut oil or cream. It's perfect for any kind of skin.
4808 2018-08-26 20:01:31 tea tree oil gives me cystic acne :(
4809 2018-08-26 20:01:28 jojoba oil, after washing and priming, before any other moisturizer you may use!!
4810 2018-08-26 20:01:28 It's supposed to be and the better stuff is. But if you look at the ingredients in most American commercial white chocolate, you will find lots of other fats in it. Like palm oil.
4811 2018-08-26 20:01:27 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
4812 2018-08-26 20:01:19 Being mesmerized by a  pastor or evangelists does morally confuse the congregation. I have been there, have done that.  Logic set in and set me free to have my own mind. I notice it is just as good if not better than the snake oil preachers. Most people follow, not lead.
4813 2018-08-26 20:01:12 I just got some tanning oil wahoo this girl is happy
4814 2018-08-26 20:00:47 Came to hoptown for Starbucks & peppermint oil ... why did I spend $50 in TJMaxx 
4815 2018-08-26 20:00:46 Come on Liz. Don’t u have something productive to do. Change the oil in your broom, scavenge some newts...something? Don’t be like Trump, and post hate all day. Lol
4816 2018-08-26 20:00:38 Try coconut oil
4817 2018-08-26 20:00:36 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.

4820 2018-08-26 20:00:24 Where I live, the island of Sandoy, the homes are powered by oil. We have a oil tank in the basement which is filled up by a tanker that visits the island.
4821 2018-08-26 20:00:21 Dr., do you see much lower oil prices in the next 12/18 months?
4822 2018-08-26 20:00:17 Rose hip oil
4823 2018-08-26 19:59:59 Which part? Can’t argue with the failure part - it happened.  The charlatan perhaps? Prefer snake oil merchant?
4824 2018-08-26 19:59:45 We're sorry just like BP for that oil spill.
4825 2018-08-26 19:59:24 Just saw a video of someone making a cake with mayonnaise..... I mean /yeah/ technically it’s got all the ingredients you want in a cake like eggs oil and a little acidity but shit.... that doesn’t mean you should USE it...
4826 2018-08-26 19:59:13 Saltines with coconut oil- old remedy- works!
4827 2018-08-26 19:58:56 72% of Americans think coconut oil is a healthy food. But the American Heart Association recently advised against its use
4828 2018-08-26 19:58:42 Oil central heating is by far the most common. Very little electric and gas
4829 2018-08-26 19:58:39 It goes to show that oil under the ground means nothing also having an oil based economy is dangerous.

4832 2018-08-26 19:57:47 Is there a smarmier, greasier, smug, self-satisfied, middle-class duo on television than #PhilipMould and #FionaBruce? They leave an oil slick worthy of the Torrey Canyon as they slime their way across the screen.#fakeorfortune
4833 2018-08-26 19:57:42 Funny thing about US antiabortion people is they don't care to kill babies when those babies are non-white having oil and lands US wants.
4834 2018-08-26 19:57:40 White husband kills wife and three kids in Colorado. And hides his daughters in full oil storage reservoirs .
4835 2018-08-26 19:57:23 You forgot corruption and a fall in oil prices and American sanctions tut tut tut
4836 2018-08-26 19:57:15 Try CDB oil, they'll even send you some for free.
4837 2018-08-26 19:57:09 I'll rub oil all over you..
4838 2018-08-26 19:57:09 Ok - but in the UK we don’t change oil until 12,000 or 18,000 miles. So why change almost brand new oil which is still good for another 9000 + miles?
4839 2018-08-26 19:57:09 not GONG WRONG U CAN'T BUY GOD HE OWNS ALL CATTLE ON HILLS-HE OWNS ALL GOLD-SILVER-OIL-U R USING WHAT HE CREATED-nothing made without God-

4844 2018-08-26 19:56:52 I just bought a cool new pants  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
4845 2018-08-26 19:56:47 Cocoba oil seems like it would feel GOOD AS HELL I should get some for my hair tbh, I need to moisturize my scalp more (HOLY SHIT ITS DRY HERE MY SCALP PROBS ARE LIKE WOAH)
4846 2018-08-26 19:56:46 the snake oil salesman will make everything better!
4847 2018-08-26 19:56:37 I had a beach house in Santa Barbara with oil rigs off shore. My husband would fish and dive near them because the sea life was abundant around them. Not so windmills as sea life doesn’t like the vibrations.
4848 2018-08-26 19:56:34 Hair serum ke hair oil eh yang sonok pakai?
4849 2018-08-26 19:56:28 Extension of Cultural Trail on Merrill St, from Virginia Ave, through Eli Lilly campus to Lucas Oil Stadium (and eventually to White River State Park) would certainly help
4850 2018-08-26 19:56:22 Mix some coffee grounds with coconut oil and you’ve got a body scrub that’s great for cellulite #dragonsden #makeityourself
4851 2018-08-26 19:56:14 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
4852 2018-08-26 19:56:00 When he speaks of an event (ie the oil reserves being opened in Alaska), he speaks about the success and how it will change things. Typical businessman- optimistic speak. Critics like to count every statement quite literally and maintain a running total of "lies".
4853 2018-08-26 19:55:51 Big fan of yours. But USA conspire with economics, military, opposition and sanctions stamp out any gov not willing to be a part of the oil based us currency,  I believe soc tries to make the playing field fair but those ldrs cant give up power or get the wealthy to be apart

4855 2018-08-26 19:55:27 Dealers / manufacturers state “every 3,000 miles” - unless you get a package from dealers that includes oil changes; then it magically is every 5,000 miles

4865 2018-08-26 19:53:47 The severity and degrees of corruption in Iran is extreme, combining that with lawlessness and the immunity of regime's corrupt elite. #Iran has 3rd largest #oil reservoir and 2nd largest #gas reservoir in the #world. Yet 80% of the population are under #poverty line.

4866 2018-08-26 19:53:26 He, cool!
That story of Turkey's oil broke about a year or 2 ago, no?
Everybody was told to stay out of the oil coming from Iraq's & Syria's war zones...
4867 2018-08-26 19:53:11 I wonder how central banks will deal with #inflation figures when  #oil price reach $90 in 16 months time (as per Morgan Stanley's).
4868 2018-08-26 19:53:08 I literally know i should've got an oil change awhile ago, like going to school for what I'm going for and all but uh what's a girl gonna do, I'm busy bro
4869 2018-08-26 19:53:07 me, at home, in tears, obsessively smearing oil paint on a canvas with 100 hues of blue and strokes pointed in different directions: IS THIS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU NOW, PROFESSOR
4870 2018-08-26 19:52:55 Smartass of the year award should go to me...
Dad changed my oil and said I owed him a six pack so what do I do? I find a ring and pull six beers out of his cooler and pop them in and bring it inside to him 
Still owe him a six pack though, gotta figure that out now 
4871 2018-08-26 19:52:53 Start up my palm oil business...
4872 2018-08-26 19:52:26 There is no place the Bible talks about money and being a Christian. God blesses those who help themselves, Jesus said, “the poor will always be with us.” Then the lady poured very expensive oil on his head and feet.
4873 2018-08-26 19:52:22 Melted butter? That could work. Doesn't coconut oil work the same way? He-- it would be all shiny and soft and slippery.

Sadly, being forbidden soulmates has a cost. They're both paying it. But Prompto gets his butt slaps in every now and again.~
4874 2018-08-26 19:52:21 Come back 4-3 please.

4877 2018-08-26 19:51:57 No skin are routine... it just might be coconut oil mused with happiness. 
And I used the front camera of my phone (iPhone 7 Plus). 
Thanks sis 
4878 2018-08-26 19:51:38 Does that look like oil or waterbased to you....? I can't bring myself to look at it without breaking into a panic
4879 2018-08-26 19:51:25 Fuck!! The oil spilled out of my cartridge
4880 2018-08-26 19:51:25 Im going to have to check all of these out because I am literally a pool of oil by the time lunch time hits
4881 2018-08-26 19:51:05 When I die, I want to be reincarnated as an almond so I can be made into that oil! Rosa you are delish!
4882 2018-08-26 19:50:54 Same in Missouri. St. Louis to Kansas City. The Kochs said no. It would cut into their oil revenue.

4888 2018-08-26 19:49:43 And thank you, honestly, for showing that some people are worried about their health and not just shit heads and wanting oil to continue to control America.
4889 2018-08-26 19:49:41 Thanks. I did wonder about peat. What does that leave: coal, oil, gas and electric?
4890 2018-08-26 19:49:37 Got an overdue oil change, a MUCH needed interior/exterior car wash, and filled up my gas tank. Talk about a #selfcaresunday for my car....

4893 2018-08-26 19:49:17 If you look into the history of some of the LPs (the dirty 30 forsure) you'll find ties and buyouts with mining corps, oil corps. Some were formed from dissolving one company and incorporating another... 
How is someone like myself supposed to go about that? 
Offshore accounts?

4896 2018-08-26 19:49:00 Oil have you know it’s no way to run an economy to rely on what is under the sea! Get a grip and stop being such an old fossil.

4898 2018-08-26 19:48:42 We know why it happened.And it’s not because @MBuhari awarded contracts and looted funds. It’s because the oil price fell and there wasn’t sufficient money to fund the country. Yet FG paid salaries of its workers and refunded states billions in Paris funds.We know.Will get better
4899 2018-08-26 19:48:40 He only served as a spearhead of a zionist warlike wrong policy. A pitiful guy who entered illegally Libya & Syria to throw more oil on fire. We got the result.
4900 2018-08-26 19:48:28 And Dick Cheney. 

"He might have done some bad things, but I respect him as an American hero who developed new, enhanced, interrogation methods, to protect our country and the whole world.

He also taught me how to start a war specifically to profit my oil company."

4902 2018-08-26 19:48:09 @elonmusk could be the savior of human kind. Tesla is great and will continue to disrupt auto... but PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Boring... all precursors to disrupting big oil/energy with free energy.

4908 2018-08-26 19:47:14 It should be a crime to put stickers on books. I've tried everything to get this one off -- nail polish remover, Windex, Goo Gone, and finally olive oil cooking spray. I'm not sure if it was the olive oil, or a combination of all four, but the book is finally free of residue.

 most of the time! N.R.A. Is for honest gun owners like myself. If you take them out of government you would need to take oil sugar rich people. Good people don't do this

4913 2018-08-26 19:46:44 In the future, when vintage bike collectors see a bike, they will define era as pre and post power meter. The way old car guys see a dash with just oil-temp-tach, pre speedo.

4922 2018-08-26 19:45:11 Why is everything you do the best in history, or something that’s never achieved before? Isn’t that a classic snake oil salesman pitch?

4926 2018-08-26 19:44:45 B/c of growing housing, food & med costs + higher oil prices, & stagnant wages, the working class has less spending power than in 2016 & before. Once all the tariffs kick in, more workers, even with 2 jobs, will fall from the middle class. But the rich are doing much better.
4927 2018-08-26 19:44:39 Oil consumption? Extra 5 litres of fuel / oil / octane boosting chemicals ?

4932 2018-08-26 19:43:37 Not to mention Oil & Gas revenue has shrunk to just 0.2b. If we left we would owe WM £9b in debt share and lose £11b Barnett

4935 2018-08-26 19:43:12 I understand the oil production has resumed at Toma South through Heglig. I think that means I’m soon getting my job back as a construction foreman at GPOC. I hope El Toor, Unity and Manga also resume soon. #PeaceMustPrevail

4943 2018-08-26 19:42:00 Iran, which is still waiting to see what the EU will do about America’s oil and banking sanctions, has started negotiations with Russia about building a nuclear power plant. That should endear Putin to his friend President Trump.

Oil is the Holy Spirit.

Jesus said the Holy Spirit was the deposit that he would be coming back for.

The Bible is a divider

The only divider in all of mankind.
There are no "races" or colors.
There are goats and sheep and the sheep hear the masters voice

4966 2018-08-26 19:37:46 Golly, #Conservatives hated pinko commies, the left according to them. And, huge #debt appeals to them, suddenly. Perhaps the "follow the money" suggestion makes the most sense of it. Actually, the only tyrants they ever want to deter are those taking to much wealth, usually oil.
4967 2018-08-26 19:37:38 Coconut oil has recently been found to be toxic. Check that before using again.

4976 2018-08-26 19:35:57 For the first time in history, thanks to capitalism, nobody starves to death in China. In oil rich Venezuela people are eating their pets.
4977 2018-08-26 19:35:50 We are the smartest animal on Earth, yet people are denying we are the cause of declining climate change. When we drain rivers, build communities, we draw oil from the ground. We dump trash everywhere. You think monkey's do this? Nope, we do. Come on!

5056 2018-08-26 19:23:20 Brilliant  
How about going after the execs and management. I'm sure plenty of loves and plenty of families have been ruined and broken because of the ease with which they have extortionate credit to vulnerable people.
5057 2018-08-26 19:23:11 Car engine is meant to run in 80-100 °C . A car without a thermostat, it runs at 50o C temperature. At this temperature, the humidity gets packed in and condensed, which blend with the oil and result to slush. The slush blocks lubrication and the entire system wear out.
5058 2018-08-26 19:23:01 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
5059 2018-08-26 19:22:56 We don't need your oil or gas. We have plenty thanks to God and technology. May all rest and live in peace whether Muslim, Christian, or Jew.
5060 2018-08-26 19:22:34 I'm wondering why the oil worked when nothing else did.
5061 2018-08-26 19:22:34 It was a photo opportunity for them. They went mute when they should have operated on a "spirit of boldness ". No oil in their lives.
5062 2018-08-26 19:22:31 I think he likes the taste of NAPA Premium Performance 5W30 Motor Oil too.

5064 2018-08-26 19:22:18 Our Walk with God is like a car. Prayer is the gasoline and Personal Bible Study is the oil. Both are Essential for our car to run.

5066 2018-08-26 19:22:08 Their are medical marijuana strains with little THC at all , that helps the muscular system  . THC special oil blend in a vape , is all I need to stop severe panic attacks .Took 3 months to safely  ween me off ,  a very addictive prescription for anxiety , horrible withdrawal
5067 2018-08-26 19:22:04 Yor guys I'm not sure what I did to deserve my gas heater tapping out on me on the coldest nights of winter. I'm not a fan of this oil heater upstairs so I guess it's off to bed
5068 2018-08-26 19:21:59 George W? Really probably the worst president ever. Took USA into totally unnecessary wars. Was friends with oil rich IS bankrolling Saudi families, including Bin Ladens & responsible for the entire present Middle East Mess! And you think he wasn't a criminal??

u ve just criticized Muslims and Christians.. hmm u r careful with Jews or love them ? 
for ur information; arrogance brought satan out of heaven and made him cursed. Jews have that type of arrogance.they want the Prophet to be from Israel children or reject him
5090 2018-08-26 19:19:23 Taste is almost the same. Oil type could be the difference. Nothing like greasy , fried dough loaded with sugar in a conspicuous brown bag.

5096 2018-08-26 19:18:41 I’ve done Ramen plenty (pro tip: I figured out I could crack it up and fry it in a little oil until golden brown then put a little water (and some of the packet perhaps) in it and let it cook off). Top it with some spicy Chinese mustard, peanut sauce, or just eat plain.

5108 2018-08-26 19:17:18 I think $AMRN probably wants to stop impulsive selling by retail investors: Not many people can read into the ‘fine’ details of the study & why comparing 4g eicosapentanoic acid to mixture EPA & DHA makes no sense—known previously fish oil mixture does not reduce cardio events.

5122 2018-08-26 19:15:23 Does anyone know why Americans change the oil in their cars at least 2-3 times as often as the SAME car in other countries? Is it just baked into their culture to change the oil early?

5152 2018-08-26 19:10:56 So she mixed up a thick cornmeal slurry, dropped it in a cast iron frying pan of oil, cooked until golden, flipped, cooked until golden, removed and salted.
5153 2018-08-26 19:10:55 consistently putting cortisone cream and coconut oil on my bites has personally always helped me from scratching them, its also helps reduce the redness and helps them heal faster
5154 2018-08-26 19:10:43 Every time I rewatch The West Wing, something new makes me cry. Today, it’s the flashback in season 2, when Josh makes that face at Sam because Bartlet is the real thing, so he walks out of the oil tanker meeting, giving up partner at his firm, to write for Bartlet

I’ll say it again. These people aren’t your friends and there’s a positive way forward
5189 2018-08-26 19:05:33 Hi I'm Alex and I stick my fingers in hot oil without thought of the immediate consequences
5190 2018-08-26 19:05:29 Wait! How was he planning on stabilizing global oil price at 100 dollars per barrel when we don't control the price?
How was I fooled like this? 
5191 2018-08-26 19:05:26 Good work Rob. Also remember when it doesn’t go in for a cambelt, oil, air and fuel filters, plugs and leads, clutch, dual mass flywheel etc you’ll be saving a fortune 
5192 2018-08-26 19:05:03 As older Texans pass, the next generation begin to question the Republican establishment and their big donors oil oligarchs. Changes are happening. Truth is coming out.
5193 2018-08-26 19:05:00 Can we come to an agreeance that its not white vs black but rather us vs the 1%.

Im white, broke, working by butt off, and try to be a good person. Not now or ever was I racist. 

The people we should hate are the ones who monopolize water and oil.

5197 2018-08-26 19:04:15 I want to find engineer that designed the oil pump pickup tube; and kick him hard in the nuts, so he doesn't contaminate the world with his DNA.

5201 2018-08-26 19:03:31 Hanging out at Gettysburg today. I got to see some oil paintings from the era up close and I think I want to teach myself oils soonish.
5202 2018-08-26 19:03:30 I got coconut oil on it and washed it and it’s still there
5203 2018-08-26 19:03:26 I love the smell of me being fresh out the shower with coconut oil and body spray
5204 2018-08-26 19:03:19 Absolute nonsense. Overpopulation is polluting. We have had oil gas long before the climate became a tipping point. But you want to put jump leads on an incinerator. So we can have even more consumption fueling more population. It is moronic.
5205 2018-08-26 19:03:12 Give me one of your essential oil pens lmao 
5206 2018-08-26 19:03:05 The level of my stupidity today: "Why are there nutritional values written on my coconut oil jar?" Because I only use it for my skin and hair, so I forgot that it is, in fact, food.
5207 2018-08-26 19:02:53 I suppose there's so many characters it's the only way (but I liked Pepper & dislike snake oil so BOO.)
5208 2018-08-26 19:02:44 We are talking about oil money boss
5209 2018-08-26 19:02:41 Kristin declares this is a semi automatic Rifle?

5210 2018-08-26 19:02:30 So many thousands of dollars spent on mechanical repairs over the years! Too bad Big Oil thwarted the electric car since its inception in the 1800's!
5211 2018-08-26 19:02:29 As in the days of Noa. The world will be cleaned by fire. The enemy will ridicule. Forgive them for judgement will be upon us all. Jesus wash us clean. Fill yr lamps with oil. The end of evil is near.
5212 2018-08-26 19:02:26 I'm a real person, Amazon does not want me to be a Bot. They care about my ideas, and they care about me as a person. When you prick me I bleed red blood not Black oil!

5214 2018-08-26 19:01:58 Castor oil and Avacado
5215 2018-08-26 19:01:44 The deep green message is ‘stop using fossil fuels’ - plastics are made of by-products of oil refinery.

So, yeah, it is a climate change solution. Y’all just pushed back on it, so it took longer.

Meanwhile, what kinda car do you drive?
Get rid of that combustion engine, sucker.
5216 2018-08-26 19:01:36 Don’t need much protein. Can they eat fats like coconut oil, nuts etc?
5217 2018-08-26 19:01:34 Poll time! What beard oil scents do you prefer? #beardoil #mensgrooming #beard
5218 2018-08-26 19:01:14 That’s it - I give in! The central heating is back on. The oil industry can breathe a sigh of relief as they’ll be well in profit til next Summer now!
5219 2018-08-26 19:01:08 We're watching a movie called Jurassic City and it's what you'd expect. There was just a sorority hazing scene with pledges baby oil wrestling in a kiddie pool. All the college students are obviously over 35 but the party just got busted by a cop who looked 20.
5220 2018-08-26 19:01:02 War mongerer who supported the bombing of millions after US oil interests overseas, and of course macron respects that.  He too is a neolib stooge
5221 2018-08-26 19:00:52 Hit a pot hole so hard my open trunk alert came on. Remind me again how Louisiana is broke with all this oil tax income coming in yet we have the worst roads

Please give me money!
5225 2018-08-26 19:00:28 Soy can trigger my seizures. Unspecified "vegetable oil" or "may contain soybean oil" is the bane of my effing existing. And xanthan gum. What's it grown on? Unless the package says "soy free", who knows.
5226 2018-08-26 19:00:23 This is nothing but a cheap snake oil salesman entertainer.

5232 2018-08-26 18:59:59 i wanted this to be me so i started adding vanilla cupcake oil to all my shampoo body wash and detergent and let me tell you it was the best idea ive ever had
5233 2018-08-26 18:59:56 @ShadowTodd A bit out of nowhere I'm really glad OHWL exists as a series because it introduced me to two albums I really love: WYSIWYG by Chumbawamba and Blue Sky Mining by Midnight Oil. I know the hit was on the prior album in both cases, but what can you do.
5234 2018-08-26 18:59:27 성혀니 캐 중에 키 작은 캐가 있었구남..
5235 2018-08-26 18:58:51 It would have been worse if it was @OfficialPDPNig in power. Now that there is not much coming from oil, they would have just moved the vault completely to their homes and unce Jonathan would say they went to test the security of the vaults as corruption is not stealing.
5236 2018-08-26 18:58:35 Chinese food is made with peanut oil so is chick-fa-la so if you do have a peanut allergy you wouldn’t know that so. You need to be educated sorry but it’s definitely not a trait
5237 2018-08-26 18:58:35 Hahaha tak cliche la haha. I guna product innisfree, cetaphil and nak hilangkan scars i guna bio oil. Tu je haha And the most important thing is bykkan minum air haha thats all 
5238 2018-08-26 18:58:34 Ima miss that $40 for a oil change 
5239 2018-08-26 18:58:33 Lol. He's no pastor. He's   just another snake oil salesman.
5240 2018-08-26 18:57:30 From watching Jackie Aina's YouTube tutorials, apply a setting/mattifying powder after your primer but before your foundation. Then apply the powder again after foundation application - helps control the oil
5241 2018-08-26 18:57:19 N160m loan secured for Governorship campaign already paid back! Did the Governor start a gold mine or struck oil well?
5242 2018-08-26 18:57:05 my hair without any coconut oil on it is truly a travesty
5243 2018-08-26 18:56:48 Nah, just a few drops of CBD oil in the Java, you'll be fiiiiiiiinnnnee...
5244 2018-08-26 18:56:48 Ye @NawazSharif ki Naajaiz Bv Hai jo her jaga @NawazSharif ki Oil change karne jati hai
5245 2018-08-26 18:56:45 the day I pay $60 they better change my oil and rotate my tires too.
5246 2018-08-26 18:56:20 but look at their assets / history

Switzerland with itss financial sector, Norway with its oil and minerals and the good sense to invest the revenues in a soveriegn wealth fund
5247 2018-08-26 18:56:09 right around the BP oil spill we had a bar trivia team named "Drill, Baby, Drill, more like Kill Baby Krill" and they managed to read it aloud incorrectly every single time.
5248 2018-08-26 18:56:05 I just had a fried egg (from my own chickens) in fresh white bread  cooked in olive oil  with a splash of garlic on it.
Twas the bollocks actually. 
5249 2018-08-26 18:56:03 Going overseas to bomb already war torn countries that we have no business invading and slaughtering innocent civilians for their oil isn't "defending America". It's imperialism in the modern day, profiting only our government.

Stop buying into the patriotic propaganda.
5250 2018-08-26 18:55:57 I'll guess the wheel was frozen enough to make it solid but not stiff
I know he then drizzled it with black truffle oil, then placed fresh tarragon on the wheel, wrapped the wheel in thick cut bacon, and the placed it on a gas grill long enough to cook the bacon almost charred.
5251 2018-08-26 18:55:36 Wow!!! Just for an oil change... that's insane!!! 
5252 2018-08-26 18:55:31 You should do an avocado and olive oil mask on it to make it more healthy
5253 2018-08-26 18:55:26 surprised avocado oil rated lower than olive oil...higher cooking temps for avocado and really no flavor....and most olive oil sold is cut with canola oil
5254 2018-08-26 18:55:22 Omega 3 are oil soluble so better water packed
5255 2018-08-26 18:55:13 Hiking trail. We set up the board. It was my turn and a friend. My bf at the time sat with his hand on my leg. We had barely started when I got this terrible feeling in my gut. Like -something- was there and it was very heavy and awful feeling. Like oil over your skin
5256 2018-08-26 18:55:01 All ministries r functions based except Railwaysh.rasheed's ministry should be converted to Transport to cover bigger portfolio, lawmaking in problem areas e.g.PIA, transport trucks,oil tankers, school buses, public transport etc.(my first tweet ever - Muhammad Azam CA)
5257 2018-08-26 18:54:47 Will it change the oil in my car too??
5258 2018-08-26 18:54:40 Only if the oil spilled!
5259 2018-08-26 18:54:19 I’d still get a nice bottle for after. That aside, I love olive oil samplers or other similar sets. I won’t buy them for myself, but they’re gifts I’ll actually use.
5260 2018-08-26 18:54:11 My mama gone fall out when she find out how much my oil change cost.. 
5261 2018-08-26 18:53:58 Cyclical climate? It’s called Global Warming. Ask Zinke to pay for it with all the land he’s sold to drill for gas and oil.
5262 2018-08-26 18:53:48 Not so fantastic inflation, too. What 6 months ago covered 4 weeks of food now only covers 3 weeks. On Obama's last day in office gas was 2.21 per gallon. You've and your corporate oil cronies have managed to raise it a dollar per, and there hasn't even been a hurricane yet.
5263 2018-08-26 18:53:03 Sure, John McCain called his wife a cunt in public and Vietnamese people something I'm not even going to type repeatedly, and yes he constantly voted for all the stupid wars that serve oil companies before America, but god damnit if I don't RESPECT the man!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5264 2018-08-26 18:52:34 Ty and Fuad the two funniest most annoying niggas when they got oil in they system! I had to ask is this how I be
5265 2018-08-26 18:52:30 .@HarvardHealth When a professor from Harvard publishes that Coconut Oil is poison, you blow all your credibility. 

The world tried to defame coconut oil years ago with their "Contains No Tropical Oils" campaign, but food scientists eventually brought back the truth.
5266 2018-08-26 18:52:26 Put some pepper mint oil on ya scalp you’ll feel it too lmao

5270 2018-08-26 18:52:03 is that the oil meme going around
5271 2018-08-26 18:51:52 It took Norway decades saving their oil revenues but Corbyn promises it...immediately.   Deception.
5272 2018-08-26 18:51:37 Nice try. Big Oil helped create this mess. They don't get to ask for help from the government to bail them out from the effects of the climate change THEY created and that all their GOP benefactors deny even exists.
5273 2018-08-26 18:51:14 Should've gotten this oil changed during the week 
5274 2018-08-26 18:51:13 {thread} Listen, I understand.  As a young person you haven't had to wait for much.  No dial-up internet, no waiting for an oil change with no phone to occupy your mind. However, Lord Huron finished at 8:50 and we took the stage at 9:20.  By my math (which is from the 80's...
5275 2018-08-26 18:51:06 I just made an aphrodisiac essential oil mist infused with hemetite, lilac, and root trauma. It’s time to change.
5276 2018-08-26 18:51:05 Tax deduction ideas for artists that tour: Car insurance, fuel, tolls, parking, mileage, public transportation (for gigs, rehearsals, meetings), vehicle repairs/maintenance (tire patching, fluid flushes, windshield repair), oil changes, washing/vacuuming, vehicle/loan interest
5277 2018-08-26 18:51:02 Except Venezuela is capitalist and a victim of imperialism. The Chavez government pretty much just nationalized the oil industry which when sanctioned by the United States and the Saudi's, that sent a shock into the economy
5278 2018-08-26 18:50:25 Nothing but scare me like hot oil when me fry sumn inna the kitchen. Once hot oil connect skin ennuh worse feeling that. You wah see me a play duck duck goose once oil stop pop inna the frying pan.
5279 2018-08-26 18:50:20 They're poor. They need the money. Oil's bounce has helped, but not enough. Putin is weak, but great at looking strong
5280 2018-08-26 18:49:45 You’re just taunting me so oil take exception! You have nothing but contempt for the battered! And once I thought you were the very flour of humanity. I’m going to shut up now before I say something even rasher.
5281 2018-08-26 18:49:41 They are literally life excluding the oil and vinegar YESSSS 
5282 2018-08-26 18:49:35 Blue screen and reboot when you said Donald Trump oil. That was great.
5283 2018-08-26 18:49:13 Potatoes get truffle oil and Parmesan. Smh. Sweet potato fries are awesome.
5284 2018-08-26 18:49:12 Your paintings are so solid. Are they oil or acrylic?

5288 2018-08-26 18:49:02 Coconut oil and bacon fat
5289 2018-08-26 18:48:55 The granularity of the statement is kind of critical. Twitter isn’t ideal for this, but in many instances I agree with your statement. In many I don’t. I fortunately work in an area of medicine that’s new and largely came after the snake oil phase of medicine.

5293 2018-08-26 18:48:30 Why the fuck CBD Oil gettin an attitude 
5294 2018-08-26 18:48:30 Just hair oil??
5295 2018-08-26 18:48:16 If so, motives might be:
a) sustain global demand for their most important export: oil & gas* while reducing demand for renewables & conservation;
b) keep Republicans in power;
c) promote discord & distrust among western nations
*Putin’s puppet’s essentially handed Iran to Russia
5296 2018-08-26 18:48:06 Largest import of fx, after oil.
5297 2018-08-26 18:47:55 And the only reason the world currency isn’t the Euro is because we’ve monopolized the oil coming from the Middle East with our stupid, imperialist wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
5298 2018-08-26 18:47:41 Did u say you are looking for Gucci guilty? I’ve it for sale my biz page is @houseofrosby on instagram. I also have all them expensive perfumes available in oil perfumes at a very affordable rate. Pls patronize me
5299 2018-08-26 18:47:33 Oil burning was always intended to be against the rules, but the FIA let it fly for ages for both Mercedes & Ferrari. Something like that could easily be secretly happening again.
5300 2018-08-26 18:47:26 @KoinangeJeff @VickyRubadiri ask @alykhansatchu what the turkana oil means to Kenya in relation to our national debt and what makes sense for us in the long-term, refining or exporting crude oil?

5309 2018-08-26 18:45:26 @1avadevine With all due respect, what kind of oil do you use for your oily porn scenes? By the way, it's extremely sexy and very arousing seeing you all oiled up. Much success and good vibes to you mamacita!
5310 2018-08-26 18:45:21 Well Canada, South America and the US have plenty of oil if the Western world really wanted to cut the Middle East off. I wouldn’t say the wars there were for democracy, that was more of a byproduct. But yes they did get it because of the wars.

5314 2018-08-26 18:44:45 To @RobertKennedyJr I would love to account all of #McCainLegacy carbon footprint with all those military expansions. Military uses more oil than 175 countries combined. 

@StateDept sold 14000 oil and gas leases and only 1% purchased by the industry.

5317 2018-08-26 18:44:26 Umm... Oil + water? As far as the east is from the west? 
5318 2018-08-26 18:44:15 It was obnoxious and funny. Now I’ve followed you long enough to know that you know that those 2 usually go hand in hand. You know you were being obnoxious so why’d you even respond like, huh. It’s Sunday, go get your oil changed w all that good pussy you sitting on.
5319 2018-08-26 18:44:13 We do not need another "conservative" justice standing up for corporations & special interests against most Americans' interests.

5322 2018-08-26 18:43:29 Oil a bowl and place the dough in it, cover and let it sit at room temperature for 2 hours.

Flour the work surface and cut dough into equal round pieces.
5323 2018-08-26 18:43:27 It should be a thick sauce consistency. Then I throw a little oil into a wide pan and let it get super hot and add the salsa to the oil to develop the flavors a little more, then I add the totopos and fold gently. Optionally you can add queso cotija here

5331 2018-08-26 18:41:40 Fix the car whereas if I’d have asked it would’ve only cost £120 to replace an old one! I now know the one on my car lasts about 60,000miles. I hope you don’t mind me saying! Also my mum taught me to do my tires, oil & water which is handy!
5332 2018-08-26 18:41:38 That whole place is a massive consumer of energy and I believe do most of it with Fuel Oil. This is the waste that is left after the refinery process. A less viscous bitumen. Horrible stuff, especially the for the

5342 2018-08-26 18:40:13 I’ve shredded a tender-heart cabbage and a fennel bulb and grated a beetroot and made a dressing with orange juice, mustard, white balsamic and olive oil. Just remembered I have a chilli to julienne...

5368 2018-08-26 18:37:08 I had to put bio oil on my face after today’s face mask. My face is breaking out like nobodies business. My forehead and eyes.
5369 2018-08-26 18:37:05 one gram capsule is a placebo amount - it equates to substantially less than one gram of EPA & DHA. For health benefits I can’t think of anyone who recommends such small amounts of fish oil. Why never a study where sufficient amounts of fish oil are used?

5429 2018-08-26 18:27:36 New Mexico now has a 1.2 billion dollar surplus that came from the oil and gas industry. Since it is a blue state they have a hard time admitting it is a direct result of President Trump deregulaing the industry. I also received a nice raise. 1st time in 15 yrs.

5437 2018-08-26 18:26:57 But roasted kale, tossed with olive oil and lots and lots of sea salt, is a wondrous thing.

5440 2018-08-26 18:26:37 Yes! My friend told me to just use tea tree oil and fresh aloe Vera since it’s just some pimples, but I heard the bahi just works great overall. I’ve wanted to try the Ordinary brand also

5447 2018-08-26 18:25:21 Think of the project like a castle wall if you like. We have plenty of siege set up on it and behind it, but if we don’t take the time to range the oil, arrows, catapults, and trebuchets, we risk massive inefficiencies as we fumble around learning curves we might have avoided.
5448 2018-08-26 18:25:21 Canola oil is actually a high quality oil according to industry standards and mainstream health standards. Most aren’t using canola actually. It’s not easy to take into account everyone’s allergies and the high cost of many oils. Not to mention many don’t hold up to high heat.
5449 2018-08-26 18:25:15 Fight about global warming is fight against leading politicians that are paid by oil companies.

5455 2018-08-26 18:24:26 It makes sense when you realize that Big Oil is actually writing those laws.
5456 2018-08-26 18:24:08 Show me where wages have risen. The min pay sure hasnt so interested to see where they have. How has technology made clean coal? Our National Parks are treasures. They should not be touched so oil co gain profit. USDF needs funding. Fire towers are closed. This potus cares less.
5457 2018-08-26 18:24:05 Add six grams of olive oil then allow to simmer.
5458 2018-08-26 18:23:58 The cotton is there because she goes to Tech in Lubbock. Lubbock is the largest inland cotton producing region in the world. Cotton and oil drives the economy, so people like cotton a lot.

5462 2018-08-26 18:23:14 I used to do that with cooking oil, mom caught me this one time, wangibulala ngenduku, after that she hid cooking oil somewhere in her room, whenever I needed It, I had to ask her, for over 10years, I was 9 when the incident happened 
5463 2018-08-26 18:23:11 Unable to sell oil? You think they’re not selling oil to anyone?
5464 2018-08-26 18:23:01 Venezuela is a cautionary tale about cult of personality, corruption, and the oil curse. It went through a similar crisis in the ‘80s oil glut that basically presaged Chavez’s rise.
5465 2018-08-26 18:22:54 I WAS LOADING THE DISHWASHER N DAD SPILT OIL ON THE FLOOR N I DIDNT SEE N I WENT FLYING ONTO MY ASS
5466 2018-08-26 18:22:52 Such a unique, beautiful creature. Mesmerizing eyes and amazing hands/feet. Palm oil is a travesty. This precious little being (and all beings here) deserves to live safely and peacefully more than the world needs palm oil, rubber, etc.
5467 2018-08-26 18:22:51 The art of shaving pre oil shaving cream and after shave has saved my husband
5468 2018-08-26 18:22:49 i’m tired and i wanna go back to sleep, but my dad is making me change the oil in my car and his car and i wanna die
5469 2018-08-26 18:22:49 Conversely though, did his looks match his intellect? If so, well, I’m no oil painting, but God help him.
5470 2018-08-26 18:22:19 church is exploiting the story of the jew carpenter. church is controlled by mafia.
5471 2018-08-26 18:22:19 CBD has worked wonders for my chronic pain!  I am essentially pain free now, which is a huge blessing.  It’s also helped my husband’s anxiety!!!  I have been amazed at our own results as well as so many others w/ pure, organic, non GMO, made in the USA & 3rd party tested oil!

5483 2018-08-26 18:20:48 I should go to West Texas and work in the oil field for like 2-3 years and make as much as I can & come right back lol
5484 2018-08-26 18:20:39 You can’t eat just one BLT. Everyone knows that!
5485 2018-08-26 18:20:23 Yam with salted palm oil. 
5486 2018-08-26 18:20:17 First, we should end this enemy of corruption starting from our counties and also government to suspend borrowing and try to invest using vast resources available ie The Oil in turkana , Agriculture, energy and SGR cargo and that's how cost of living will be eased
5487 2018-08-26 18:20:09 Yes that’s because Nigeria is still centered on oil right now, very little is being done to increase manufacturing within the country which will reduce the prices of those agricultural products you mentioned, I heard banks through CBN is giving loans out now to encourage farmers
5488 2018-08-26 18:20:01 Every real Canadian should love Energy East!  Time to say "non" to foreign oil!

5495 2018-08-26 18:18:44 .. it’s beard oil 
5496 2018-08-26 18:18:37 The price of oil and the role of oil in the economy of Venezuela has nothing to do with what's happening there. Socialism MUST be to blame.

5498 2018-08-26 18:18:12 @dstaples 54% on faceoffs!??? Oil could use him as coach! David says faceoffs are just one of many puck battles. Not so on PP and PK, where possession is critical. Sooo many Oil PKs: lost faceoff, full minute of pressure (or quicker goal...) PPs, lost faceoff, puck down the ice.
5499 2018-08-26 18:18:07 Trump ran on clean coal to gain votes from an industry that needs to be put to bed and create new jobs for clean energy. Fix our bridges, roads & infrastucture. Provide training and schooling and education. Not please the oil giants. Trump has never ‘earned’ an honest days wage.

5502 2018-08-26 18:17:24 Great Speech, however; what about our independence of energy and the billions that we could generate right here in Canada rather than giving billions to Saudi Arabia who hate Trudeau & his Stupid Caucus that don't have a clue how to negotiate anywhere! So now we buy dirty oil!!!
5503 2018-08-26 18:17:23 Shortly after launching a new project in Angola, French oil major Total said it was searching for more resources in Africa, including in Senegal and Mauritania. The company is historically strong in Africa and, buoyed by rising oil prices

5508 2018-08-26 18:16:53 The housing bubble was a direct result of Frank/Dodd Bill that changed the restrictions on people applying for home loans.  Kids buying houses on 60 year loans or interest only loans.  Then when oil prices went up, everything went up, and these kids couldn't make their payments.
5509 2018-08-26 18:16:46 That man said you need synthetic oil no baby i need my basic oil heres yo $20 move along
5510 2018-08-26 18:16:42 With this solution u don't need to - seasoning it with hot oil stops the scratched bits being a problem - apparently!
5511 2018-08-26 18:16:40 There were many windows running all around the top deck. Plenty of light and at night they had oil lamps.
5512 2018-08-26 18:16:36 Then you should understand most wars in the Middle East are over oil .

5529 2018-08-26 18:14:08 Senator, this country is led by wakora at the top. Below them is a bunch of entitled civil servants who barely buy milk or sugar or cooking oil from the market. They make policies from their spotless couches in public offices drinking tea and whiskey. Bure kabisa
5530 2018-08-26 18:14:07 The combination of statehood and selling the entire AEEPR (PREPA) should eliminate the PR Oil Cartel and its low-grade contaminated fossil fuels, fake certification laboratories and, above all, its profiteering.
5531 2018-08-26 18:13:52 And they wonder why they never attain a larger role in the body politic than being a squeaky wheel that refuses all attempts to oil it.
Fucking purity people. Hey, Bern-it-to-the grounders: THIS is why you can't have nice things.

He voted against MLK day-repeatedly.

Said he'd hate the 'gooks' as long as he lived.

Fervently supported oil wars in the Middle East.

5554 2018-08-26 18:09:56 From my reading of the predator death capitalism that John Perkins wrights of in Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, about countries that stand up to US, getting screwed, would bet that when they Nationalized "their oil" the CIA played some economic games on them.--
5555 2018-08-26 18:09:42 Venezuela relied heavily on their oil which wasn't wise hence their predicament. How does callin for sharing the land and Venezuela's oil reliance co-relate?

2) I thoughtfully ordered 4 washers last year, using one for the last oil change. 

3) I, presumably, put the other 3 washers in a safe place. Need I go on?

5563 2018-08-26 18:08:33 Even forcing the terroristic and barbaric Moslems to live together with Biafra, to use them to continually commit genocide against Biafra, for oil and gas, is part of the respect for the differences. Why is Britain afraid of Biafra's emergence?

5601 2018-08-26 18:04:20 Ganpati idols are now made in clay & oil paint is not used. So, no one should have any objections now.

But the carcasses being thrown into the river is highly objectionable - may lead to diseases & what not. Those guys should be identified & put in jail.
5602 2018-08-26 18:04:05 Consolidate and combine the IL treasurer and IL comptroller offices to actually put money in the pockets of taxpayers. Stop with your snake oil salesman pitches. We know you are only trying to expedite state confiscation of these assets. #twill #SwampCreature #WalkAway from #Dems

5604 2018-08-26 18:03:58 Nigeria is not only the most populous country, but also the largest oil producer in Africa and the world's sixth largest oil exporter.
5605 2018-08-26 18:03:49 where are all the food stamps welfare hawks now? 

*cashing their big oil bailout checks*
5606 2018-08-26 18:03:47 To reduce cost of living Turkana oil should be well exploited n processed in Kenya it will help reduce energy cost which control all economy n social sectors #SundayLive @VickyRubadiri @KoinangeJeff

5609 2018-08-26 18:03:38 And the British love, in murdering over 6 million Biafrans to confiscate their oil wealth, which they are still keeping up to now, is showing. All the repressive policies, including land use act, which they are slamming on Biafrans, depict love.

5616 2018-08-26 18:03:03 57 follower troll says what? Don't give up on ur draft dodger,  dude. Little Georgie Bush was one too and got thousands of working class Americans killed in his undeclared wars for access to ME oil.  (Which we lost but still have that access,  funny that). Somebody must have lied
5617 2018-08-26 18:02:56 It's a large oil and gas field in the Mediterranean
5618 2018-08-26 18:02:49 There is some off shore gas & oil reserves. But reading up on it, it sounds complicated about who 'owns' it.  Not as simple as Corbyn makes out.
5619 2018-08-26 18:02:26 Well it was and it still is a disgrace.
I will look back at it.
I imagine that the oil in the Middle East could have been the reason for any fraudulent war.
Are you a she ? Because you called me dear?
Respect to you any way.
Once I’ve researched I will be in touch.

5631 2018-08-26 18:00:45 It would be easy to make with soy mince if you wanted to try. You soften garlic, add the mince and the rice. Add water til rice is cooked and absorbed all. Then spread out on your widest tray and sprinkle with olive oil and bake 180C until crispy

5644 2018-08-26 18:00:00 Nope. My grandfather allowed him to remove the oil for 12.5% of the profits and warned him that nothing but bad would befall Marland and the Ponca people because of it. He was correct as Marland later went bankrupt and Ponca land was polluted by all the refineries that popped up.

5661 2018-08-26 17:57:03 Yeah, we're all learning what we think is bad, is really just our uninformed imaginations. That the only real way to cut out killer carbon emissions is to burn more carbon-based fuels.   The frustrations these disgusting gov't's & their oil overlords produce-immeasurable.

Due to oil there, the western world has to try something no? Also let's not forget without western intervention Israel might not be anymore

5738 2018-08-26 17:46:10 No idea what 77 is, your figures are as inaccurate at today's prices now as those predicted by the SNP then, so completely pointless to use without at least a basic check.
Who's prediction, all above relate to historic facts, except your oil price predictions
5739 2018-08-26 17:46:02 Definitely need to get that oil change tomorrow ... IT’S MUST!
5740 2018-08-26 17:46:00 I started with their oil and now I use the capsules, but both are good!
5741 2018-08-26 17:45:56 That's a good point. But my take away from this is don't repeatably heat coconut oil up for cooking. It just means that coconut oil is not an option for deep frying in restaurants.

I dont think deep frying should be a staple cooking method for anyone for that matter :/
5742 2018-08-26 17:45:52 I love you soooo so so much Claire ahhhh. You mean the entire world to me and this community is so SO lucky to have you in it. You're a ride or die oil lady and I appreciate that more than you'll ever know.

5749 2018-08-26 17:44:50 I could’ve sworn that last night all the bearded kings at Hope & Anchor were wearing the same fucking beard oil.
5750 2018-08-26 17:44:46 Islamist Fascist regime in #Iran gave up on #Iran's rights to $12.3T (Trillion) of OIL & GAS fields in the Caspian Sea!
REASON: Appease Russians & neighboring ex-Soviet Republics!
5751 2018-08-26 17:44:35 GKR: Funnel cake is when you have batter in a funnel that is dispensing into the oil. Fried dough is like dropping flattened pizza dough in the oil.

5753 2018-08-26 17:44:08 I need beard oil & Cantu shampoo
5754 2018-08-26 17:44:05 This cold isn't clearing, even after an olbas oil bubble bath! At least tomorrow there's not many in work so won't be mithered much all day #ThinkingPositive
5755 2018-08-26 17:44:02 I never pay attention to oil costs cause I usually have well over the level cap, plus the canteen regens a lot too

a lot of people suggest having a smaller cost fleet but early game that can be hard

the way I grind is just doing maps with good drops (2-3, 2-4, 3-4) since you'll
5756 2018-08-26 17:43:49 You did learn though! You can do oil changes and stuff!

5758 2018-08-26 17:43:30 Oil leaks show up like rainbows on wet roads. Can't get it looked at because of Bank Holiday and I need it ffs. Oh well just hope it's not a major problem.
5759 2018-08-26 17:43:10 I need to get my oil changed in my car & get tf up and be productive.
5760 2018-08-26 17:42:59 That sounds like a snake oil salesmanship at work. That or it’s a temporary solution. For women, the ability to reach the big “O” starts in the mind.
5761 2018-08-26 17:42:32 Yep.  Snake oil salesmen are alive and well.
5762 2018-08-26 17:42:27 Destroy some U.S. ships

5763 2018-08-26 17:42:05 I got mine a year ago to use the oil. 160$ for the first and last order.
5764 2018-08-26 17:41:30 And not long after we had unnecessarily bomb, bomb, bombed Iraq and Afghanistan on the way to Syria and the whole oil slick so Exxon could eke out profit from a dying planet.
5765 2018-08-26 17:41:27 How about the last 300 years? Oil was and remains a short term blip.
5766 2018-08-26 17:41:17 People in Kerala who use coconut oil for generations are keeping excellent health. The Harvard professor is certainly wrong.

5770 2018-08-26 17:40:25 This is not religion.
This is snake oil hucksterism.
It preys upon the weak willed and afraid, uninformed, uneducated masses by playing to their core fears.
Little more than performing for $$$ that causes lasting damage to society.

5777 2018-08-26 17:39:21 Wife is watching Afflicted on Netflix, and I am just.  So angry at the snake oil being peddled on this show. It is infuriating. I wonder if @sydneemcelroy has seen this show. Cc @Sawbones
5778 2018-08-26 17:39:19 The first characteristic of excisable goods is LUXURY. That includes CARS and their inputs (oil/gas). Addictive, i.e tobacco, alcohol. Goods with negative impact in society i.e tobacco. I insist you go back to school; primary school.
5779 2018-08-26 17:39:05 Hi @KetanVora4  the pics during the Canada trip were self explanatory...when leaders from serious countries like India go to America they go with a serious agenda of trade and diplomatic issues like oil from Iran  ..toe to toe with Americans ...that is how you get respect
5780 2018-08-26 17:39:05 With respect I'm not impressed with you're college degree or you're smooth talking not impressed with you're $100 shoes or you're paisley ties not even youre happy socks I'm impressed with the men of God getting down in the celler where the OIL is and getting anointed #needajoash

5785 2018-08-26 17:38:40 Charlie converted his car to run off cooking oil
5786 2018-08-26 17:38:38 In some the states like kerala coconut oil is used in food preparations. For ages in my native people are using coconut oil for hairs & rubbing for body to work as moisturizer. This is for ages & no complaint has been raised. I wonder why MCI & scientific community rule this out.
5787 2018-08-26 17:38:38 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Psalm 23:5
5788 2018-08-26 17:38:13 That trade works both ways of course.
Wonder if bayernbru has any idea what the net trade balance between Scotland and RUK is in goods and services and whether the value of oil exports, for example, are counted as an export from Scotland?
5789 2018-08-26 17:37:49 Since I live in Zone 9 I can have two harvests. I think my best tip is the plants get plenty of water or the tomatoes won’t grow well. Plenty of compost or Black Cow dirt. I don’t have a pest problem but if I see any I use Neem oil
5790 2018-08-26 17:37:43 Ponte lavender oil on your temples before you go to sleep! It really helps with anxiety! 
5791 2018-08-26 17:37:28 Sooner we get off oil the better. I could care less about the price. I earn half as much as a minimum wage full timer.
5792 2018-08-26 17:37:19 I bet you call it “sports ball” and have a ton of beard oil
5793 2018-08-26 17:37:12 There's people around saying it's not happening, keep calm, burn oil and coal

5795 2018-08-26 17:37:09 When Guiana / Guyana Start to Pump Oil it will get Worst than Venezuela because if the Government can't Find over 1/2 of a Billion Dollars how would they Find the Sale of the Oil Money . England Needs to take back Guyana because the People are Unfit to Run the Country . Marco
5796 2018-08-26 17:37:02 @braveshavecinci  more rubbish fund raising people dont beleive this nonsense. Cancer can be cured by so many healthy other things .  No sickness no loosing your hair cannibas oil is 1 of many and gcmaf research it .
5797 2018-08-26 17:37:01 bro, I think It would have been better without like the oil paint I think you used... Can you show a V2 version with reg. text
5798 2018-08-26 17:36:57 And ignoring it is only making us more oil dependent and those they put in office will keep it that way and Oil is their main reason for war.
5799 2018-08-26 17:36:52 Ridiculous mumbo jumbo. Why do people follow and attend these snake oil salesman? Gullibility is a disease.
5800 2018-08-26 17:36:44 Wont the oil prices make biofuel an option again?
5801 2018-08-26 17:36:08 I'm not even joking
5802 2018-08-26 17:36:04 What Rubbish you are spreading. No oil company will be putting up such poster's.  Yes data collected may be for a definite purpose
5803 2018-08-26 17:35:53 I watched this Video, thanks for the Link..

The OERB Program makes a good point.. all this demonization of Oil out there .. yet we rely on Oil for so, so many things !!  What's wrong or inaccurate about teaching the History of and the benefits of Oil??

Thanks for the Video, :)
5804 2018-08-26 17:35:48 That's why I'm a vegan. It's to diminish the inflammation that comes with psoriasis.  I avoid oil and eat loads of green leafy veg for my cardiovascular health, as well as  vegetables in general. I also consume PQQ-rich foods for antioxidants.

5806 2018-08-26 17:35:18 I love the UK. My children are born here. I've spent my whole adult life here and hate to see it descend into chaos by snake oil salesmen and charlatans.
5807 2018-08-26 17:35:17 I’m going to check out the little already prepped cut veggies Wegmans got. I have some Portabella mushrooms breaded from them. Fried in a little olive oil was good.
5808 2018-08-26 17:35:07 Assholes. Poor kids grow up to hate and want to kill us too..just as they are taught. This place needs to trade oil for,  let's go with, maybe say...some  water and a plant or two..green up. Something to be non-angry about..it all is too sickening to watch.

5815 2018-08-26 17:33:34 Not true. Read "Game Change." Sarah was picked for her gender and for her reputation for fighting the corrupt Republican Alaska boys club. She was a popular governor who successfully got reparations for her state from the oil industry. He was appalled by her campaign antics.
5816 2018-08-26 17:33:26 If I make it to brunch and beats don’t be alarmed by my zombie tattoos. A shower didn’t work and neither did oil. I’m assuming the key might be alcohol, but I don’t have any of that right now so I’ll wait until I get home 
5817 2018-08-26 17:33:26 Yes Somalis live there and that’s wonderful. The amount of war and conflict that would emerge from multiple ethnicities fighting is completely avoided by an ethnically homogeneous nation. It’s best that somalis under an unified state has the oil.
5818 2018-08-26 17:33:22 The same Arnold Clark’s who left my oil filter loose and made a mess on my drive. ?Despite e mails  and promises to cover costs. I am still waiting for cleanup. Yes -the same @ArnoldClark company ,different depot. All as bad it would seem
5819 2018-08-26 17:33:18 I assume you're talking about oil not banking.. :-). I agree and I think current Liberals are also doing that. In the here and now though there are pressing reasons to improve current oil industry to fund the change. Not ideal, agreed, but I don't know of good alternative.
5820 2018-08-26 17:33:07 I imagine not a lot, doesn’t seem like the type of bloke to have regrets. Likes the challenge and genuinely seems to love it at blues. Could have gone on to great things at Leeds but blues could have been bought by Arabian oil tycoons, didn’t happen no use looking back.

5826 2018-08-26 17:32:42 It's a crisis caused by capitalism.  The economy was tied to oil prices in US dollars. Government borrowed on the international markets taking loans denominated in foreign currencies. It suffered sanctions from the US. Many causes. Only a simpleton would say socialism caused it.
5827 2018-08-26 17:32:38 Pres Buhari aka Mr 'integrity' who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum, had not made known to Nigerians the budget of his Ministry, let alone how much the country had generated from the sales of oil daily since his assumption of office three years ago.@SweetShantel
5828 2018-08-26 17:32:30 Exactly. 

People think larger commodities like oil aren’t manipulated at all

5831 2018-08-26 17:32:11 I’ve seen first hand footage from documentary film maker Peter Mettler. Aerial shots and a full scan of the size of the problem. Your little “restoration” projects can’t greenwash the impacts. This is not oil yet you call it oil sands. Bitumen is better described as tar than oil.
5832 2018-08-26 17:32:05 After pampering myself yesterday...today it was the car’s turn. Oil change and long overdue in and out cleaning. 

Related: the next rainstorm is completely my fault.
5833 2018-08-26 17:32:01 Speaking of radar, the curvature is also the reason why communication was lost after the helicopter disappeared ”below” wave reach, then crashed into sea outside of UK years ago, before signal being picked up again from oil rig. Gotta love flat-earther nonsense 
5834 2018-08-26 17:31:46 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
5835 2018-08-26 17:31:45 Scottish oil?? Never heard of it but I have heard of British north sea oil
5836 2018-08-26 17:31:39 I like where your heads at, but if your cylinders are clicking you might want to get an oil change.....
5837 2018-08-26 17:31:36 @Walmart How much longer are you going to allow rude and seemingly incompetent staff to run your auto department in Elverta, CA? 2 hours for an oil change (I was 2nd in line when they opened)? And incorrect statements/fraud on receipt? Mgr Joey was RUDE.
5838 2018-08-26 17:31:15 No. 

Also wtf,  and no.

If from agricultural to oil/gas age with good market and development opportunities, Nigeria still can't brag of any, we do need a different approach to resource mngmt.

5863 2018-08-26 17:28:27 Yeah I only use acv along with hydrogen peroxide, hot water, tea tree & lavender oil, Aztec clay and Castile liquid soap
5864 2018-08-26 17:28:17 I vape oil cartridges w only THC. I was thinking I should try the 50/50 carts. My pain level is @ a all time low  cbd has a lot to offer to but if it kills the buzz its not for me.
5865 2018-08-26 17:28:01 Ha ha just keep topping the oil up 
5866 2018-08-26 17:27:50 'Going on about oil' why did you respond with inaccurate oil prices and selectively showing a letterbox view if they are irrelevant.
At £10, it'd never work either as cost of production is more than than and the balance would be negative.
5867 2018-08-26 17:27:48 Yes color does that's the one good thing that 45 has done he's made us aware that color does matter that's why you see more openly racist people since he took office just as oil doesn't mix with water we shouldn't mix with each other in marriages!
5868 2018-08-26 17:27:44 Just driving back from Tesco's in the Hilux. Following a trail of oil spillage. Thought, christ someone's got a problem. Followed it till it turned into MY drive......Oops. Hope it's not expensive.

5871 2018-08-26 17:27:29 But you forgot to mention that Somalis are living there. Oil doesn’t change culture.
5872 2018-08-26 17:27:29 A washing with Zanfel will remove the poison ivy oil that is still in the layers of your skin, which will stop the itching and put your body in a position to immediately start healing the rash. You can find Zanfel in the first aid section of most pharmacies. It Works!
5873 2018-08-26 17:27:27 Sir Ian Wood did say that but has been proven wrong with new fields identified to the west of Shetland and elsewhere. Scotland should not rely on oil tho, too much carbon, we must leave it under the sea and further develop our wealth of renewable resources.

5876 2018-08-26 17:26:40 Transformations on a global scale are challenging for the human species. We are transforming our ways to communicate (phone is obsolete, email is almost), transport (oil is almost ob), governing (democracy in crisis), commerce (corprations' ascendant). 

These changes = mean govt

5894 2018-08-26 17:24:42 I'm not most people, easy to figure out, and have already commented about it many years back. Also, electric vehicles won't create oil slicks on the roads after a rain, gas spillage at the pump, tailpipe exhaust and noise pollution, and smog.

5899 2018-08-26 17:23:52 When your Dad sends you to the garage to buy oil for your car unaccompanied. What sort of responsible parenting is that?! How many oils are really necessary? 
5900 2018-08-26 17:23:51 Now see  your argument is falling completely apart. I’m an albertan, born and raised in Oil country, worked in the oil industry and I have said absolutely nothing that supports what you are claiming. Continue ro be angry for no reason.
5901 2018-08-26 17:23:50 If successful, do you think it goes to $20? (Still have IP issues). Given failed fish oil and TG trials, the probability of success has to be pretty low. Maybe 10%?

Last night unknown attackers threw oil to the house of JP leader Qasim's wife.This is all very concerning with elections ahead
5904 2018-08-26 17:23:16 Any proof that in 2014, crude oil sold for a $100 and above?
5905 2018-08-26 17:23:08 They’re using it as an oil tray to collect dripping oil from that old car that’s always parked outside your house?

5908 2018-08-26 17:22:59 When Palin was nominated as VP in 2008, she had a moderate, pragmatic record.  Check out how she dealt with oil companies in 2006-2007.  She did not do well in the campaign and unfortunately became a reactionary afterwards - but she was not that person when McCain nominated her.

Poetic cinema
5913 2018-08-26 17:22:24 A few issues:
Is olive oil the proper negative control? Probably not.
Should fish oil dosing be one-size-fits-all? Probably not.
Are all fish oil supplements created equal? Probably not.
5914 2018-08-26 17:22:17 ... more of why the Scots desperately want independence....

5917 2018-08-26 17:21:57 We’re not talking about oil or food. We’re talking about 10k officers. You seriously think creating £ for 10k new officers, which is completely domestically possible (100% of the resources needed to make this happen are within your own country), is dangerous fantasy nonsense.
5918 2018-08-26 17:21:41 figures. big oil that likes small government and no interference wants government to fix the mess they knowingly caused.
5919 2018-08-26 17:21:22 That’s a great question. To make Lurpak Softest softer than standard Lurpak Spreadable we have retained some buttermilk from the churning in the product & added some more rapeseed oil than in standard Lurpak spreadable. Let us know if there’s anything else you’d like to know

5925 2018-08-26 17:20:31 Looking at the guy's Twitter feed, he's just a financial snake oil salesman who obviously said something controversial to drive clicks his way.
5926 2018-08-26 17:20:21 nigga. think deep fried Oreos but plantains

the thc isn’t in the oil ur frying them in, it’s in the batter coating the shit. dummy
5927 2018-08-26 17:20:12 Your point is Venezuela collapsed because they couldn’t sell oil to capitalist countries. They used their oil revenues for social programmes until the oil ran out. This is what happens with socialism. Capital is not allocated correctly, with time this results in supply shortages.

5930 2018-08-26 17:19:10 This is ridiculous. No one needs oil that much. #SocoInternational

5932 2018-08-26 17:19:02 Ah, yes, fair enough. I'd prefer to see experts argue over the accounting issues with GERS for a balanced debate on that one. As to misleading numbers however, I recall, (Sir Ian Wood? The Scots expert on Oil) saying the SNP had grossly inflated estimates for N Sea Oil. True?)
5933 2018-08-26 17:18:57 5. Coin the turkey sausage.
Assemble
1. Preheat the grill to medium heat.
2. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, paprika, about 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste) seasoned salt and pepper. Stir.

5940 2018-08-26 17:18:17 Ok. If you were prime minister, do you think you could just ignore the oil and banking industry?  IMHO any party would need to work with with EVERY large industry in ANY country. It would be too disruptive otherwise.
5941 2018-08-26 17:18:05 It’s a love/hate relationship with these oil cartridges. I could easily be high all day

5944 2018-08-26 17:17:12 You’re talking utter bollocks. Unlike the USA, which is a continent that can be self-sufficient, the U.K. imports vast quantities of food etc., it’s not just about oil. Dangerous fantasy nonsense.
5945 2018-08-26 17:17:09 He needed 17 days to realize the implications of taking oil money? What a genius! Meanwhile, the teslemmings (led by you) were overjoyed.
5946 2018-08-26 17:16:54 At least not until Aug 24, 2018. They suddenly were the good guys assisting $TSLA going private and “help transition the world to clean energy” or whatever. Maybe they are bad again after Aug 25, 2018? Back to the Big Bad Oil corner?

5957 2018-08-26 17:15:25 You don't need "expensive" hair products to grow your hair. Water, a good natural butter, sulfate free shampoo, deep conditioner and prolly an oil with a good regimen can do it.

But you need "expensive" hair products to have beautiful, defined curls 
5958 2018-08-26 17:15:16 Trump sold his loyal supporters snake oil and it's wrong. However, when the FACTS and evidence support his criminal activities, it's going to be a big pill to swallow for his supporters. Being able to think independently and objective is going to be critical for his supporters.

5967 2018-08-26 17:14:05 Something more than ineptitude perhaps bearing in mind the wealth from oil.
5968 2018-08-26 17:14:05 What about the pollution from oil rigs, oil tankers, reffineries, tanker trucks delivering the gas/diesel to your car over its lifetime?
5969 2018-08-26 17:14:01 Iyasi benar, cm aku tetap pada pendirianku kalau oil dipakai di akhir. hihuiiw
5970 2018-08-26 17:13:52 I remember 38 cent a gallon in 70s. And yes is a scam if Tx is putting out so much of our own oil now...why is price still up?

5974 2018-08-26 17:13:24 Keaton went to the store, got some oil and a filter and is now changing my oil in my car. Seriously the sweetest guy! 
5975 2018-08-26 17:12:37 I think you’ll find the 2014 flooding of oil market by Saudi & US which led to fall of profits in regions where oil is more expensive to extract like Venezuela played a pretty big role too. They suffered under Reagan’s oil policies too although he was targeting USSR
5976 2018-08-26 17:12:29 FYI! Sauve makes a rose oil infusion shampoo! It smells wonderful!
5977 2018-08-26 17:12:22 As long as you have the real resources to actually do it (such as 10k people wanting to be officers, material for 10k uniforms & Billy clubs) then the value of the Pound will be largely unaffected. Domestic spending is entirely unrelated to what currency is used to purchase oil.

5980 2018-08-26 17:12:00 Love this, I love oil lamps
5981 2018-08-26 17:11:59 So what you are saying is that oil improved the lives enough to make a larger middle class more wealthy, hence lower class raised to the middle. Then the government decided to subsidize and expand it’s social programs to the point where “big oil” could not support.
5982 2018-08-26 17:11:59 I 100% agree with you that that should be a massive priority but - in my opinion at least - these issues go hand in hand. To my mind, I can't recall another country which discovered oil and got poorer as a result.
5983 2018-08-26 17:11:55 @CovinoandRich 710 77345.  Shell oil on the calculator

5985 2018-08-26 17:11:28 Have they thought about drilling for oil on your head???
5986 2018-08-26 17:11:27 Greek vs. Roman
scientists vs. entrepreneur
philosophy vs. hard science
thinkers vs. makers

all thought provoking

Also interesting theories are e.g.
merchants vs. conquerors
ppl of olive oil vs. ppl of butter

Yet, all end up stretching things in order to stand by their point
5987 2018-08-26 17:11:25 "Having fun with oil again?"
5988 2018-08-26 17:11:23 Aww that’s horrible  hopefully you’ll find an oil that helps!! I know they work wonders for me so maybe that will help get things back to normal 
5989 2018-08-26 17:11:18 You’re not an oil painting yourself

5992 2018-08-26 17:10:48 The problem with the privileged and their mates, look the way they don't want you too. Like on the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, they had us all looking there but not looking at North Sea when they moved all the maritime borders to take Scotland's oil

5994 2018-08-26 17:10:24 If you tend to leave your body, engaging the senses, especially touch, smell + sight, can help ground + bring you back. Some ideas: A frozen orange, a scented oil, a soothing lotion, a photograph or piece of art.

6002 2018-08-26 17:09:42 Sure, perhaps. Hopefully you will get to the point where you will just eat the fish & not need the supplement oil, nor perhaps some of the meds. They could be taken with large fatty meals when you eat them.  Supplements are unnecessary, and unkown through most human history.
6003 2018-08-26 17:09:42 Don't go there? Why not? Because tech companies are big?
Oil companies are big.
How come right wingers only want regulations for their pet issues, for everyone else it's "free market"?

6005 2018-08-26 17:09:27 It's not about being a bitch for big oil, it's about what's best for Canadians and the world. It's best for Canadians because domestic oil production and refining will lower gas prices. Best for the world cause you don't have to ship it across the globe.

6008 2018-08-26 17:09:03 I just blew 270$ on an oil change, engine light diagnostic and a new gas cap. Pretty sure they overcharged but whatever. Why every time I’m above something has to go wrong with my Jeep.

6010 2018-08-26 17:08:42 You believe those who take 92% of our oil wealth and lie about our economy when they tell you scots are skint and have huge debt.
I look forward to those like you Jocky having to accpet scotland is better off indy.
6011 2018-08-26 17:08:38 So I’m allergic to olive oil, and I tried avacdo oil for the first time !!! I loved it it’s way better
6012 2018-08-26 17:08:37 Destined for the oil lamps....
6013 2018-08-26 17:08:16 Remember, kondisi kulit setiap org berbeda dan cara penggunaan step by step your skincare yg beda jg pasti punya kelebihan masing2 di tempatnya. Jadi nambah ilmu kalo oil dipakai sebelum bisa jd booster tp kalo sesudah berarti untuk mengunci si essense yg dikasih sheetmask.
6014 2018-08-26 17:08:12 RakshaBandhan day wid family at HarishShetty’s #Aharveda restaurant @ Andheri Bombay, which serves health food BUT which is super-tasty.Not a drop of oil/ghee,no dairy products, gluten-free food that’s finger-licking!The food has medicinal qualities coz it’s pure.Xcellent service
6015 2018-08-26 17:08:11 !! I got some oil paints recently as well, and I'm equally terrified to start with them. Did you see Jared's video about them in a Moleskine?
6016 2018-08-26 17:08:02 I absolutely love anything coconut. Coconut oil especially...has helped me lose 4 stone and put diabetes in remission.
6017 2018-08-26 17:07:56 To soak up the extra oil?
6018 2018-08-26 17:07:34 And they held their peace. And the chief of the LORD to Babylon, and deliver every man of God to Jerusalem, to set his foot in oil.

6020 2018-08-26 17:07:14 It's your mob who bang on about ingyref2. Not the SNP, who just happen to be the best thing that's happened to Scotland. Thank goodness your mob will never govern Scotland. Snake oil salesmen the lot of you.
6021 2018-08-26 17:06:53 I've just cooked roast veg with honey, oil chilly & mixed herbs ( not my own home grown) though. Tasted yummy.

6023 2018-08-26 17:06:45 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.  I didn’t eat any rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I didn’t put any oil on my body until the three weeks were over.

6024 2018-08-26 17:06:21 I fixed my blower motor, changed my oil and replaced my headlight, all I gotta do is fix my blinker and my car will be set
6025 2018-08-26 17:06:09 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us WAR CRIMES!
6026 2018-08-26 17:06:08 Looks scrumptious! Would love an oil and garlic based recipe. (Lactose intolerant )
6027 2018-08-26 17:05:57 I CAN change my own oil. But the local Aamco shop does it for what I'd pay for just the oil and filter. So I'm out of the oil changing business.
6028 2018-08-26 17:05:56 I changed my bedding today and I just spilt eucalyptus oil on it. Not my day!
6029 2018-08-26 17:05:49 My sister gave my dog a cookie that had CBD oil in it and know she’s higher than a kite 
6030 2018-08-26 17:05:36 @HALELIFE_ what strength is the CBD oil in the samples in the sample packs? I cannot locate that on the site, or the package for someone who wants to buy a full size of one of the droppers.
6031 2018-08-26 17:05:35 Non Oil GDP should be the focus of all, therein, we solve unemployment.
6032 2018-08-26 17:05:35 I drink bulletproof coffee for fat to help certain meds and fish oil get absorbed while fasting.
6033 2018-08-26 17:05:26 Friess, will destroy Wyoming, and let the oil companies drill baby drill. Vote him out Wyoming.
6034 2018-08-26 17:05:23 Yes it is an opinion piece, but it is framed as an endorsement of the product as something you should definitely buy. The new tech could be great or it could be snake oil, I don't know and neither does the author. From memory they don't even know the price point.
6035 2018-08-26 17:05:22 Satu lagi, jangan langsung percaya dengan satu sumber karna setiap kondisi kulit itu yang tau masing2, mungkin ownernya biasa pakai sebelum dan itu works cm selama yang kubaca oil itu untuk mengunci kelembapan yang dibuat sm sheetmask. hehe mari kita banyak2 baca dear

6038 2018-08-26 17:05:09 Try green sparoge with eggs and Olive oil and apple vinegar.
They don't come back but taste good.
6039 2018-08-26 17:05:00 No recuerdo muy bien cómo volví del casamiento pero me desperté toda maquillada y peinada aún y con mi cleansing oil de Boscia en la mano. There was an attempt.
6040 2018-08-26 17:04:55 No, the oil doesn’t go onto the paper, the oil is dropped onto a felt pad that is placed inside the filigree cap which aerates through the top, so you inhale it as you write 
6041 2018-08-26 17:04:36 Garlic and Olive oil. Mix them together, warm it up slightly. It works wonders for pain. Also, a glob of Coconut Oil, put that in her ear. As it melts from body temperature it will ooze in and help.
6042 2018-08-26 17:04:28 Pres Buhari aka Mr 'integrity' who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum, had not made known to Nigerians the budget of his Ministry, let alone how much the country had generated from the sales of oil daily since his assumption of office three years ago.
6043 2018-08-26 17:04:28 I no longer have to pay 120 for each oil change 3 times or so a year, i don’t need to have all my fluids replaced for like 700 bucks at 30k miles. On average I’ll save about 2-3000 a year on gas depending on how many miles i drive obviously.

6046 2018-08-26 17:04:06 At age 64, I stopped changing my own oil after jacking up my 2014 Genesis and discovering a hard plastic shroud blocking access to the entire engine block, held in place with ELEVEN bolts.

Screw it. The Aamco shop down the street does it for what I pay for the oil and filter.

6049 2018-08-26 17:03:53 I plan on making a silly haul video soon, but the thing that would most likely steal all of my time will be oil paints. Never really tried them (well, once with a friend but I wasn't even serious because I was scared AF) so it will be quite a ride...

6051 2018-08-26 17:03:46 This will offend some, but my gripe is with extra virgin rapeseed oil, come on, this really is trying to make a silk purse from a sows ear. It was a cheaper alternative to other oils, a weed potentially producing 2 crops a year, now your asking me to pay a premium? 1-2 marketing!
6052 2018-08-26 17:03:46 So in that sense, they're lucky it's all a load of bunkum and snake oïl.
6053 2018-08-26 17:03:41 One of my fave food shaming people is my coworker who is like 65 and whenever she sees me eat those bagged salad mixes always says HOW CAN YOU EAT THAT WHOLE THING it’s grass with oil that’s how. I can eat lettuce forever and still feel hungry come at me bro
6054 2018-08-26 17:03:17 No, I think tRump's commission  we will learn, was  only a  .05% share of the largest oil company in Russia, still hundreds of millions ... the other 19% share, I think, went to Glencore. @worldflood1 has a good thread going on this.
6055 2018-08-26 17:03:17 God has as much to answer as the indigo marshmallow king in the centre of the universe so you are right. Roughly equal likelihood of actual existence.
Not speaking about them, speaking about the snake oil salesmen from the middle of Rome who look after a regime that damages many.
6056 2018-08-26 17:03:08 Peppermint essential oil for me: 1) a great bacteria killer. 2) great for coughs, colds, bronchitis- just rub on the chest & nasal passages.  3) I love eating it too!
6057 2018-08-26 17:02:52 they called everybody to the alter to get prayed for, me and odalis were contemplating then they said where’s the oil....odalis talkin about “sis we was gone break out anyways, they got olive oil” girl!
6058 2018-08-26 17:02:50 In Male City a man was brutally stabbed by a group of armed men last night. In Hulhumale a man was attacked and sustained injuries to the head recently. Last night unknown attackers threw oil to the house of JP leader Qasim's wife.
This is all very concerning with elections ahead

6089 2018-08-26 16:59:39 Not even for lighting a lamp

6090 2018-08-26 16:59:38 Avoid putting sunflower oil in your body. The average person has way too much Omega 6 in their diet and when out of balance with the other Omegas you become seriously pro-inflammatory.  No research been done with C60 in the mix to say this is safe due to the action of ROS and C60

6124 2018-08-26 16:55:27 Oh man. Wedges soaked in water for a few hours, covered in corn starch, doused in coconut oil, and roasted for 20-30 mins. Even better dipped in maple syrup.
6125 2018-08-26 16:55:25 Oh dont eat butter its bad for you, instead eat margarine, its better for you. 30 years later, eat butter its healthy, margarine is infact bad. Stop cholestrol, 30 years later, maybe its not bad for you. Current fad, dont eat coconut oil, its bad for you.

6130 2018-08-26 16:55:03 It helps to hire other people to do the chores as much as possible. A housekeeper, get groceries delivered, etc. Men dont sacrifice their professional career to mow the grass or change the oil themselves.
6131 2018-08-26 16:54:44 Murdoch, with Cheney, Rothschild and others own Genie Energy, granted permission by Israel to drill VAST  oil reserves in the illegally occupied Golan Heights.

Not a fan but the Geordies could’ve achieved the same if oil money had gone to St James Park rather than Maine Road. City just lucky.
6147 2018-08-26 16:52:14 Lots of really poor countries out there that have oil.

6151 2018-08-26 16:51:14 Likewise the same way the date released that Nigeria is out of recession didn't reflect in the price of garri, rice,beans palm oil in Nigeria market.
The same way Nigerian can't feel out of recession in their pockets and lives

The same way $€ is still on the rise against naira
6152 2018-08-26 16:51:12 I have encountered a dishonest shill in the #Cannabis community that is basically hawking snake oil to sick people. I was pretty disappointed to see she has 70k+ followers, including more than a hundred of mine. Hopefully no one subscribes to her "app."

6155 2018-08-26 16:50:33 No, some have a lot more water than others.  Fresh vegs/fruit vs. grains.  Also, oilseeds have a lot of oil and protein.
6156 2018-08-26 16:50:20 It was going to be over in 6 months and paid for by Iraqi oil too.
6157 2018-08-26 16:50:15 Carrots with dash of oil, vinegar and salt. 
6158 2018-08-26 16:50:12 So Venezuela has had record high & low GDP levels under socialism.
Just as say Greece has under capitalism...
The UK is not wholey reliant on oil & under attack from the US, so impossible to compare to Venezuela.
6159 2018-08-26 16:50:09 lack of diversification and reliance on oil prices, yes
6160 2018-08-26 16:50:05 And the innocent civilians are not “ enemies” of some US proxy oil war.
6161 2018-08-26 16:49:48 Thanks, dude, girls ramai berminat. But no longer code in Oil and thus inaction
6162 2018-08-26 16:49:43 I believed fast food restaurants used palm oil
6163 2018-08-26 16:49:42 Snake oil salesmen draw out the snakes.
6164 2018-08-26 16:49:35 The extra revenue raised from North Sea oil over the last twenty years means that Scottish people have more than paid their share. How convenient to forget that.
6165 2018-08-26 16:49:34 I take a cod liver oil but it’s a liquid and it’s lemon flavored so it really isn’t that bad but I just hate swallowing pills
6166 2018-08-26 16:49:31 The default camo cream is simply just colored vegetable oil so yea, it's free from any haram substances.

It also doesn't block or enters the pores so your face is actually able to breathe. So applying your wudhu ON your camo isn't actually a problem. After solat, touch up lor

6176 2018-08-26 16:48:51 Have fat, oil, or citrus peels leftover from cooking?  Putting them down the drain can clog the sewer/waste lines in your home.  Pour leftover fat in a jar with a lid and let it set up, then throw away.  Throw citrus peels right in the trash instead. #howtogetridof #cooking
6177 2018-08-26 16:48:31 Stick with the problems in the city you are supposed to run. You and your governor at this point should be working on the traffic issues. The thousands tons of carbon spewed into the air because cars can’t move are a real problem. Not the oil industry. Your failure as a leader.
6178 2018-08-26 16:48:24 Já vou voltar falando de uma banda foda em
Midnight Oil
6179 2018-08-26 16:48:19 Exactly. Those shops look filthy and the smell of old oil from those fried chicken shops is an abomination. Muslims are over represented in environmental health breaches.
6180 2018-08-26 16:48:06 I have rarely read more absurd demands. Let me try to explain why I think these are absurd by turning the table on you. Imagine an African saying:
1-The US comes to Africa to take oil and minerals.
2-The US gets entrenched in Africa through proxy wars.
(to be continued)
6181 2018-08-26 16:47:45 You caused me to flash back on the image of GWB strolling hand in hand with the Saudi Crown Prince. Our stubborn, short-sighted, greedy refusal to give up oil has poisoned us literally, as well as having poisoned our foreign policy.

6186 2018-08-26 16:47:32 Chef McElroy cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with toast.
6187 2018-08-26 16:47:30 Nothing like bulletproof coffee to make you feel like you’ve just been poisoned with motor oil and you’ve only got 90 seconds to live.
6188 2018-08-26 16:47:30 
6189 2018-08-26 16:47:28 if you wat tolook at the reasons follow the growth of the humble pot noodle! ramen drid by frying in seed oil.Massve growth since 1976
6190 2018-08-26 16:47:28 Not forgetting Lewis’s “they had tricks” comment regarding Ferrari. When Merc have been utilising their oil as an added fuel bonus each race for 3 plus years.
6191 2018-08-26 16:47:09 My face loves vitamin e oil!
6192 2018-08-26 16:46:58 Exactly. If they had managed the oil industry correctly, the drop in oil prices would have made little to no damage, given that they made the nation's budget based on HALF the oil price (stole the rest)

Oil was at $100 and then $40... Governments before Chavez managed <$10
6193 2018-08-26 16:46:57 Look at where venuezuela is now, the centre can not hold since it was plough into recession. They couldn't manage the oil resource well with their 35m plus population. Baba Buhari has been able to stabilzed ours to this day.
6194 2018-08-26 16:46:43 Any disruption in leadership slows things down.   Hitting them in the wallet is good too, supply lines, food, oil, weapons etc.   We should be investigating recruiting methods and taking out their Cyber assets, online recruiting, etc.
6195 2018-08-26 16:46:42 For the folks who ignore the murder of south african farmers based on the color of their skin...keep them in mind the next time you eat a fruit or vegetable...buy a diamond or gold band for a loved one or use a lotion with shea, hohoba, or cococut oil. They also feed africa #look

6198 2018-08-26 16:46:27 I was wondering about the whole “oil money” piece:
Tesla’s not big enough to significantly hedge the value of oil income loss, and its very mission is to accelerate that loss.
6199 2018-08-26 16:46:24 Found a baby who’s crazy about me, changes the oil in my car, and eats my ass #winning

6201 2018-08-26 16:46:08 Ppl question big oil, tobacco, etc and ask for accountability but if you dare to question big pharma & vaccines you are a lunatic. I still vaccinate but If one of my kids seemed off I would delay it 6 Mo or a year. Fuck everyone else’s opinions they are my kids, not the states.
6202 2018-08-26 16:45:55 Not true, the oil country may have common benefits with US, but we don't do everything they want.

we stopped selling oil to US before the 1973 war with Israel, and we succeeded in liberating vast areas of the occupied territories, and we expelled the US ambassador in 1988
6203 2018-08-26 16:45:54 @drdrayzday hey Dr Dray, wanted to ask your opinion on the usage of seabuckthorn fruit oil in addition to a moisturizer over night. do you think it’s too fragrance-y or likely to cause allergy?
6204 2018-08-26 16:45:44 .@FarberwareCook I just bought the 3Liter Filter Fryer model 563865679 and I'll be damned, but can't figure out how to get the oil filter cover off from the oil reservoir for cleaning. I don't want to breaking anything due to improper disassebly

6208 2018-08-26 16:45:23 Start by soaking the bread in water until soft. 
Drain the bread and place it in a blender along with all the tomatoes, oil, garlic and salt. 
Put all the ingredients in the blender and start stirring until you can see the creamy texture. #salmorejo

6222 2018-08-26 16:44:05 Good message in that Tweet!
6223 2018-08-26 16:44:03 Esports teams strike me as more like motorsports teams than like the franchise-based league teams oil billionaires buy. Low barriers to entry makes starting a team from scratch easier, but also reduces the multigenerational staying power behind the valuation of most teams.
6224 2018-08-26 16:43:38 In some places olive oil for dipping is blended with seed oil.  Waiters may not even know the details. One way to find out is tell them you are deadly allergic to seed oil and have them check with the chef.
6225 2018-08-26 16:43:26 Right?! The one pill I actually take is an omega 3 fish oil one from Trader Joe’s but it’s a gel capsule and odorless. That’s the only way I can handle vitamins if they’re not gummy

6234 2018-08-26 16:42:32 Just in case; large chunks of Scottish exports booked as English. We wouldn’t spend on nuclear weapons/submarines/aircraft carriers etc. A ludicrous expense we’d wipe from our books. Large oil fields off East Coast, currently & falsely classed as English, would return to Scotland
6235 2018-08-26 16:42:12 I wonder why someone who worked in the oil industry would be anti-Corbyn?

6242 2018-08-26 16:41:10 Next, the frequency is often loose in a few extra cooking oil.
6243 2018-08-26 16:41:07 
6244 2018-08-26 16:41:00 Then when the oil is hot enough , dip your semi dry ravioli in the flour coat it well and put it in the pan  I did that for each one and I let each side crisp for like 5 minutes each
6245 2018-08-26 16:41:00 Not much, no. This has been happening for almost 20 years. US was largest customer for Ven oil for most of that time. Always paid on time.
6246 2018-08-26 16:40:59 Its a good time too to make the change

People are becoming more health conscious (even though we still suck at it). Work the "Seed Oil causes heart disease/cancer" angle to get people's attention. 

Make the food cooked in seed oil synonymous with poison and masses won't buy it
6247 2018-08-26 16:40:54 Just make sure you use the coconut oil to mix with. I wouldn’t want you to have any issues. Good luck!! I use oils for anxiety and they help so much

6251 2018-08-26 16:40:48 Republicans loved McCain. Please don’t say they would let him die disrespected by this con artist who has sucked away their senses with his team of fast talking,  pocket picking, snake oil brewing thieves.
6252 2018-08-26 16:40:31 I work in oil trading and shipping. So when we leave we will have zero trade arrangements. Nothing. So if company A sells steel to Kuwait today under a trade agreement with no tariffs, after Brexit Kuwait will have to impose the highest tariff they have on steel. Let’s say 10%.
6253 2018-08-26 16:40:30 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
6254 2018-08-26 16:40:29 Some of us are from the days where Men opened building and car doors, moved chairs in a restaurant for you to sit and otherwise yielded for Women (and Children) first. Just one change, some of us no longer replace the spark plugs (or change the oil).
6255 2018-08-26 16:40:20 Where can I complain about my mother selling CBD oil on the internet? Is this where?
6256 2018-08-26 16:40:19 And worse I fear scots will need EU to protect us from our 300year union partner.
They went to illegal war for oil in Iraq
I can`t see then taking scots vote on the chin,
they can`t threaten our trade if in EU so indy cant be scuppered.
Sad reality

I seasoned flour with adobo ,lawrys & parsley ..take your raviolis and preserve the sauce  lol for last. taking a ravioli out one at a time and taking off as much sauce as you can but it’s no biggy if you don’t get it all off.
6265 2018-08-26 16:39:29 six-month deadline set by Reserve Bank to finalise resolution plans for around 70 large stressed accounts worth over Rs 3.8 trillion ending on Monday, banks are burning midnight oil to avoid bankruptcy proceedings against these defaulters who are mostly power producers.
6266 2018-08-26 16:39:19 But there’s another pun? Amu-rayu (rayu is the name of the oil).
6267 2018-08-26 16:39:18 I literally cut them up into chips drizzle some oil and salt and put them in the oven!

6270 2018-08-26 16:38:57 No? Im going to go ahead and assume you’re an idiot. I was defending hamilton and ferrari not accusing ferrari. First of all the oil burn wasnt illegal and still isnt illegal only the was a limit put in place. 2nd it was ferrari burning more oil in a race it affected them more.
6271 2018-08-26 16:38:57 Also, talk to your doc about CBD oil. It is the part of the plant that doesn’t get you high. Has many benefits.

6275 2018-08-26 16:38:34 So I started the IB Guard peppermint oil capsules today. Natural antibiotics, soothing properties, and I can definitely feel them working. It feels like I just drank peppermint tea, which I do often. But I also smell like a candy cane.

6282 2018-08-26 16:37:52 Has anyone thought about using CBD oil and you’re just unsure? It’s the real deal hop off the fence and give it a try. Message me if you’re ready to feel better.
6283 2018-08-26 16:37:47 Can o suggest a great documentary called the Merchants of Doubt. It chronicles the tobacco industry’s 50 years of public manipulation. It worked, so the oil industry jumped on board and have been pouring millions into creating doubt in the public, which equals zero public action
6284 2018-08-26 16:37:46 IT IS WORTG IT. 

I just finished, they used Jasmine oil. Agsgdhd they were so cute. I love them? 
6285 2018-08-26 16:37:40 My husband think he should put oil in his hair.

Me:oil and water don’t mix, you hair need water. Oil will prevent hair from getting that water in. It’s shiny but still dry.
Him: “ohhhh make sense”

6292 2018-08-26 16:36:29 I pray you don't fall for the one who does not wear make up or attachment but secretly sleeps around. And ignore the one with manners & a heart of gold who will bring peace to your home, just because she has wool in her hair and oil on her lips. Lol! Happy hunting Oga.

6313 2018-08-26 16:34:57 You're spot on. Also the government called themselves "socialists", but did they care that the oil high prices affected negatively people around the world? No, bc it was their business, and they needed the money to maintain the socialist "everything is free" dream. It didn't last

6338 2018-08-26 16:31:23 Bio oil! It’s a little pricey but EXTREMLY worth it! I used it from start to finish of my pregnancy and still use! It helped avoide any stretch marks and left me glowing!

6372 2018-08-26 16:28:20 At the end of the day, it is “Just Short Track Racing”. But it doesn’t always necessarily make it right. There is and will always be a fine line between the two. All I know is Graf has some “debt equity” to pay off now, and Lucas Oil Raceway might get wild

6374 2018-08-26 16:28:04 Rather more than that, excluded by the Saudi Oil cartel, they can't sell their oil, US sanctions and CIA agitation have encouraged the Crapitalists to sabotage production of goods and services. Now there is white flight
6375 2018-08-26 16:28:02 That’s good to know that it is fully sustainable. However the truth is the word “sustainable” is slightly confused in modern context! It would be much better to completely phase out palm oil in the next 5 years or so!

6392 2018-08-26 16:26:03 Typically countries could just continue selling their resources, whether it was coal, oil, or whatever to countries other than the US and generally stay afloat.

6395 2018-08-26 16:25:45 That's true. I remember my grandparents used to carry mustard seeds in big bags to the community oil press, operated manually. Freshly pressed oil would be collected in metal containers and consumed within a fortnight. 
Today our branded mustard oil comes from PET bottles.

6407 2018-08-26 16:24:13 Yes, they probably prefer vehicles with lots of oil changes, expensive fidgety thingies that need to be replaced at every service interval and way more expensive to refuel.
6408 2018-08-26 16:24:08 This is not news, has been known for decades. It can be worked around by substituting anise oil for licorice root. Many commercial products use both.

Refuse to support those establishments until the standard of cooking oil changes. Make continual efforts to spread the word of the dangers of Seed OIl.

But let him bring back coal and oil spills and epidemic, that'll surely make it GREAT.

6437 2018-08-26 16:20:28 You have to feel the only chance for a positive outcome is a statistical false-positive (do enough trials and one will be positive by chance). Any effect if fish oil on CVD is (sadly) negligible

6471 2018-08-26 16:16:45 Go take your car to get the oil changed by a lube tech said hipster beardy!
6472 2018-08-26 16:16:38 Nobody talks about Mexico as socialist. Until recently they had a national, government run monopoly on: oil, electricity, telecommunications... many lessons to learn on how that worked out for them (not saying it will always end the same way but..)
6473 2018-08-26 16:16:29 He’s also violating one of the Christian bible’s earliest laws if he’s speaking in tongues without a translator. Time for him to load the snake oil cart up and leave town.

6477 2018-08-26 16:16:14 Highly processed. Yes. Junk. But for Con-ola oil we can as well go for butter or ghee 

For that matter any animal fat will do.

6479 2018-08-26 16:16:09 Like, what the hell is Kante doing on the right side of the pitch?
6480 2018-08-26 16:16:05 I'mnot ''anti socialist'' either, but it's not only sanctions.
Most of the wealth of Venezuela was coming from the biggest oil reserves IN THE WORLD.
Now PDVSA, national oil company, is consistently producing losses instead of gains.
There surely was mismanagement and corruption
6481 2018-08-26 16:15:55 Saudi oil recover costs in BOE is low enough to offset the shipping IIRC the data I was looking at.  Ecosystem values are a similar,  their ecosystem is a desert and ours was recently glaciated.   Both are low value. Objectively they win,  but it's probably insignificant.
6482 2018-08-26 16:15:52 I doubt that the US will be sending financial hitman to the UK and try to destabilize them for their oil as they did with Venecuela.
6483 2018-08-26 16:15:51 And now for the olive oil

6489 2018-08-26 16:15:31 Aaaaaaaaaaw! Just seeing you I will not only taste, drink and even get poisoned with your almond oil on you!!! You really look healthy. WE NEED MORE TREATS ON YOU ! 
6490 2018-08-26 16:15:25 I recently night your foundation along with the baking oil. (Which btw, how stinking cute) I really want to make it work because the shade is perfect to a t! But for some reason it was separating on me. I have oily skin so I was hesitant & didn’t use the oil the first time. Help!
6491 2018-08-26 16:15:23 Take it down a notch, Skippy. You taking about the war? I was against it from the beginning. Listen, those people on 911 died for oil, plain and simple. Were they innocent? Yes. But so were the million Iraqis we murdered when everyone with half a brain knew they were blameless.
6492 2018-08-26 16:15:12 I'll walk in the store on the right for just one thing like oil, and end up leaving with spray oil, oil sheen, condition, grease, earrings, and chap stick

6494 2018-08-26 16:15:10 But what about all that Scottish oil England cant survive without?

6498 2018-08-26 16:14:57 Virta guys are suggesting Canola as the next alternative as it has a better mix of PUFAs but it's still seed oil and is probably bad too.
6499 2018-08-26 16:14:57 PDP ran 30 states bankrupt when oil sold as high as $120 - $150/ pb.
PMB bailed them out when oil sold as low as $28pb

6529 2018-08-26 16:13:01 I applaud your efforts in ending our dependence on oil & I support you in this great endeavor but I must disagree w/you on this. John McCain spent his life promoting war & shares the responsibility for the deaths of thousands of people. His legacy. He should own it.
6530 2018-08-26 16:12:51 Only if the bread has butter on it (or is being dipped in like olive oil if you're fancy)

Step 3 - Restyle through the day with any regular cooking oil (frylight if you’re on a diet)

6535 2018-08-26 16:12:24 Ah yes.  All America's fault that the communist govt has spent all the money from Venezuela's vast natural resources (more oil than Saudi Arabia!!).  Bunkum.  Typical of a communist-run country.  Spend everything and more. Borrow till you can borrow no more. Then bust.
6536 2018-08-26 16:12:16 I'm notttttt! It's coconut oil 
6537 2018-08-26 16:12:13 And yes, although vegan footprint in the ecosystem is most of the times better, never forget all human activity might cause harm or negative impact. That's why we also try to avoid palm oil or coconut oil. Cheers

Hydrogen is cleaner and places dramatically less wear and tear on an engine.  Just needs infrastructure to refuel and that can be done: think Walmart.

6559 2018-08-26 16:09:32 Venezuela sold its oil to China and Cuba years ago. No one forced them to. The only decent revenue stream they can hope for is if the US buys but they chose to make enemies of them

6576 2018-08-26 16:06:58 There are some who think the government must be run more like a business. I wonder which business they mean. Oil companies who lied for years about the dangers of global warming. Cigarette companies who knew & hid of smoking risks. 3M who knew risks of Teflon chemicals years ago?
6577 2018-08-26 16:06:58 The problem with this is the vast majority of people and that is what the church is people. Do not act like this or support this but the snake oil salesmen are what gets posted.
6578 2018-08-26 16:06:58 I apologise for off topic question. If somebody cannot afford olive oil, ghee and butter on LCHF then what option would you suggest to be used for them?
6579 2018-08-26 16:06:56 I have its photo !!! Daily I discard my oil on him over all whole family oil and grease over his pic!!! What more we can do obeying orders. I consider human waste as an oil fertiliser and what not. Am I wrong ?

6585 2018-08-26 16:05:38 @howardlindzon @alphatrends I am a veterinarian and we are suggesting CBD oil , off label for mild seizures and pain.
6586 2018-08-26 16:05:33 It is excessive oil burning on air and roads which is creating the disastrous environment disturbances. The excessive hindu MLA should be taught the hard facts. He should stop moving in petrol and diesel vehicles and use pool cars and battery driven vehicles.

6588 2018-08-26 16:05:24 I use some stuff based on citrus oil, costs twice what the chemical stuff costs and lasts half as long. But it does work, and has no neurological risk.

6592 2018-08-26 16:05:18 First pressed, Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the healthiest. Your right, coconut oil is not healthy and does have a false, positive reputation.
6593 2018-08-26 16:05:08 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
6594 2018-08-26 16:05:03 The oil companies should open their books of account in order for the public to see and for transparency and accountability since their functions has also the quasi-public interest aspect that serves directly the people tulad nang pag-ga-gas sa kanilang mga sasakyan, etc. Now na!

6642 2018-08-26 15:57:31 I took the liberty of detailing the fryer today. Went to fill it back up, and we don’t have enough oil  now I’m af GFS to buy more and they aren’t open yet

6652 2018-08-26 15:55:30 Careful hating on Vietnam. A good chunk of our men were there against their will. My dad  is one of them. They never got the welcome home like the soldiers from our oil wars do, and were often shamed. It was a lose-lose situation. Let's not re-live that.
6653 2018-08-26 15:55:06 Nothing smells better than a coffee shower scrub sprayed down with vickie secrets vanilla lace, oiled up with coconut oil. I smell like I can drink myself lol
6654 2018-08-26 15:55:04 more butter (or olive oil) then pull cooked edges in a little bit and tip the pan so some of the uncooked egg oozes out to the sides and cooks fairly immediately, repeat a few times so there isn't as much raw left on top, then do the turn.
6655 2018-08-26 15:54:44 That is what he wants to do, hence putting Pruitt in. The man who sured EPA more than anyone. Because Trump is laid by Big Oil.

6656 2018-08-26 15:54:43 You weren’t “fighting for the country” you absolute fool. You were fighting to add some commas to oil companies net worth. Hope it was worth killing all those brown kids so you could get a business degree or whatever
6657 2018-08-26 15:54:36 Yup, please also display the outgo on account of the oil bonds sold years ago that are maturing and how they have to be paid back. That would be an even comparison.

6674 2018-08-26 15:52:50 A news letter that specialises in oil price analysis bashing renewables wonder why that could be? They have been writing articles about lithium / battery pricing recently with the clickbait title ‘the one thing that batteries need that will rise 800%’ invest now beat the rush!
6675 2018-08-26 15:52:38 Who the hell votes for Saudi oil? Do they understand the oil has to be shipped here on a boat? Not to mention their lack of environmental standards.

6677 2018-08-26 15:52:36 If you ask a green, he will say the "Canadian oil is worse."

If you ask a consumer, he will ask "which is cheaper?".

Cause that sounds really dumb
6698 2018-08-25 23:57:28 The market for the oil at this point has been mainly up in the Midwest, where it's contributed to a glut, and as those do, lowered the prices of the oil.  If it got down to Houston, it could be sold for more, both encouraging the further harvest of an awful kind of oil...

6717 2018-08-25 23:57:28 The market for the oil at this point has been mainly up in the Midwest, where it's contributed to a glut, and as those do, lowered the prices of the oil.  If it got down to Houston, it could be sold for more, both encouraging the further harvest of an awful kind of oil...
6718 2018-08-25 23:57:18 beep beep, it's oil
6719 2018-08-25 23:57:17 Ok so I'm not actually an oil painter, but when I was young my parents got me acrylic paint because they were told that real oil paints were dangerous for kids. I think oils required some sort of chemicals to clean the paint up with. Perhaps it was just that =]
6720 2018-08-25 23:57:16  Thanks .... now I will never be able to view cod liver oil in the same way.

6722 2018-08-25 23:57:05 @lori_go @BetoORourke @tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NRA You re saying this as if its a bad thing. Of course Texas Oil supports the candidate who is interested in boosting Texas economy. Another GREAT reason Texans support @tedcruz. #TedCruz2018 #ToughAsTexas \nhttps://t.co/BcpdJzzTeW

The rehabilitation of david frum back into respectability (15 yrs after conceiving the "Axis of Evil" lie justifying 1/2 a billion dead and oil companies' current occupation of Iraq) is not a good thing now that Trump Enablers consider pardons/quick rehab.

6734 2018-08-25 23:55:01 Actually, their steamed jasmine rice was OK. Coating on fried chicken was greasy, not crisp and overcooked—cooking oil prob not hot enough. Sauce was basic sau-sau for lumpia. Needed A LOT more cilantro, seasoning.

6746 2018-08-25 23:53:18 Pipeline companies don't buy/sell the product. They charge to transport it through their system. It is about half the cost of rail. It is partly why CDN oil producers get less for their oil. Lack of access to markets is another reason.

6754 2018-08-25 23:51:44 It sounds like the issue wasn't whether funding was available, but whether $TSLA could accept being bought by Saudis. I can imagine why Saudis might want to control $TSLA and slow expansion to a crawl. There's still a ton of oil in those fields. Maybe Elon didn't consider this.

6756 2018-08-25 23:51:11 What happens if Soviet socialism comes to Saudi Arabia?  First five years, nothing; then a shortage of oil.
6757 2018-08-25 23:50:55 I haven't seen any advantage to being an energy exporter.
   Why are our prices remaining soooo high. All energy exporting country's I have any knowledge of have berry low gas and energy prices.
    I think no energy" oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, nukelar" should leave U.S
6758 2018-08-25 23:50:51 And it is Betsy Devos that is recharging the batteries to Make America Stupider Yet.  To control people you have to limit their education.  Control the education, food supply, water supply, Oil, and the Economy.  Trump has attacked each one of those.

6773 2018-08-25 23:48:30 Can you do something about my RIG stock.  Since Putin flooded the market with oil it has not rebounded.
6774 2018-08-25 23:48:29 Lucas Oil is a nice stadium
6775 2018-08-25 23:48:21 This is like saying the Iraq was wasn’t about oil because none of the soldiers who fought in it owned an oil company.  That logic doesn’t hold up.
6776 2018-08-25 23:48:19 i had to do a oil pastel self portrait and spent so much time on my one hand that i ran out of time to do anything else and rushed and ended up hating it i feel ya
6777 2018-08-25 23:48:13 No. Between our 2012 Volt, 2014 Volt and 2015 Model S. Each Volt needed 1 oil change. 2012 Volt got new tires at 60K and Tesla new tires at 75K. That's it with over 200K miles. Sadly son totalled 2012 Volt in June. Getting Tesla Model 3 next week.

6788 2018-08-25 23:47:00 1/ In the race to find the next super-dense energy source, it looks likely that alternative fuels will come ahead of fuel cells & even renewables... For example, Coco Methyl Ester ie. a derivative bio-diesel obtained from coconut oil has a higher cetane number than "clean" diesel

6792 2018-08-25 23:46:32 Yeah they can. There is zero oil to change. Only thing is tires. Brakes don’t even wear out because they aren’t really used due to regen braking.

I agree, money will not solve Global Warming. We need a culture change, ie stop burning oil and find alternatives.

6841 2018-08-25 23:38:52 Venezuela has the largest oil deposits in the world. How did they become so poor with financial mismanagement? I'm not buying that story, the USA will love to walk in and take all of this.

6858 2018-08-25 23:35:29 But did you try it? It's just eggs and oil. Those both go in cakes separately.

6867 2018-08-25 23:33:39 Sorry but you are wrong..check the economic numbers since POTUS DJT has cut taxes for all Americans, good paying jobs are back in MFG. ENERGY, COAL, OIL, all the major retailers have record earnings ALL because people are "happy" again that's because POTUS DJT has MGA
6868 2018-08-25 23:33:36 It means your car is probably already screwed as by the time these things come on it's just about dry of oil. Need attention asap. Don't drive it further than the nearest oil.

6870 2018-08-25 23:33:11 I have no problem with the 1st invasion kicking Saddam out of Kuwait the 2nd was based on the lie Al-Qaeda was in Iraq, they weren't, and WMD that didn't exist. It was all about Bush's re-election and the west getting a foothold in the oil region.
6871 2018-08-25 23:33:08 Remember, when Obasanjo got into office in 1999, he met $2 billion in our reserve and oil price was $19 per barrel but we didn't enter recession, so you people and Buhari will not come here and be spewing nonsense. This government is incompetent.
6872 2018-08-25 23:33:08 Never thought about also no oil changes, tune ups, etc. That’s another bonus.
6873 2018-08-25 23:32:40 I change my own oil for $60 every 6,000 miles. Gearbox oil change every 60,000 miles ($250). Can you beat that? All else is virtually free, as I do my own
6874 2018-08-25 23:32:35 Unlimited crude oil? Where did you see that?
What about the environmental costs of accessing that oil? Tech is great, but the earth is winning, not humans.

6879 2018-08-25 23:32:16 Ways to keep #calm while #driving.
1. Listen to audio book of positive messages, classical music, or sounds of nature 
3. Enjoy the silence 
4. Before driving, spray essential oil of lavender, citrus, or floral 
5. No caffeinated beverages #mindfulness

6882 2018-08-25 23:32:00 Yessssssss. I have a rec for some awesome seasoning oil that we started using for ours that keeps all the lovely seasoning there and makes sure it doesn’t rust if you want it! (We’ve been using cast iron for years but just found this stuff and it’s )
6883 2018-08-25 23:31:36 Then you're the one being ignorant and intolerant. I know a number of Trump supporters (I'm a Cruz man) and they are far from "racist." How many Trump supporters do you know or do you just believe the snake oil CNN and MSNBC peddle about them every day?
6884 2018-08-25 23:31:27 For vegetarian side we're going to saute kale stems, leeks, and cayenne pepper, and olive oil then when that's tender will add the kale leaves just till they wilt. Eating clean
6885 2018-08-25 23:31:15 I worked, went to the gym, hung out with friends, got my oil change, washed my car.. and it’s barely mid day.. I think it’s safe to say my day has been productive
6886 2018-08-25 23:30:50 @SallyCapp @LordMayorMelb Just rode down Flinders St. What an absolute s&*thole. The amount of spilled food waste, oil and grease and litter on the road is worse than I have ever seen it. @cityofmelbourne should be ashamed.
6887 2018-08-25 23:30:39 Ahh okay, that may have been my problem before, as I just dipped it in water but that ended up turning it into a mess so I guess it was oil that I would’ve needed  I’m sure you’d be able to no problem, although a mug might be too big! 
6888 2018-08-25 23:30:34 Very interested in the results. I’ve been looking for an olive oil that has an olive taste, does that even exist?

6892 2018-08-25 23:29:43 Shiites for Trump, huh? Buddy you need to understand that Donald Trump doesn't have a clue about internal Iranian politics. Regime change to him, means we take your oil. Shia or Sunni, pro or anti govt, he doesn't care. Saudi pays him and all he sees is Trump Oil & Gas.

6900 2018-08-25 23:26:11 Venezuela is authoritarian. Chavez's charitable actions mainly served to keep him in power while he overspent and made power grabs. The country relied too much on oil, so it failed when the international price dropped. It was greed and irresponsibility, not simply "socialism"
6901 2018-08-25 23:26:04 pro tip - use coconut oil !!

6905 2018-08-25 23:24:31 (simplifying) northern italy's kitchen traditionally doesn't use oil to cook, but butter. central italy (tuscan food) is what started french cuisine when caterina de medici married henry II and brought her own cooks. southern italy's kitchen is fried food / very oil based

6909 2018-08-25 23:24:09 I think many people consider themselves an expert in many more matters than just the Oil&Gas sector. There are analysts/experts in the fields of politics and environment that should not be allowed anywhere near it. Just my two cents worth.
6910 2018-08-25 23:24:07 Fix it by:
-Avoiding dying/bleaching it

-Using Hair masks

-Avoid Hot tools

-Use conditioner before swimming

-Leave the colouring to the professionals 

- Use sulfate free hair products 

-Oil your hair an hour before you wash it
6911 2018-08-25 23:24:06 Personally all people would love peace in the world. But Government greed from many countries will never allow peace. We have war for oil, War because of religious differences and inequality for many War and interventions haven’t worked so far and maybe never will

Being an adult is awesome.

6936 2018-08-25 23:19:55 The men in the Trump family are the worst dressed multimillionaires and billionaires I've ever seen. Their suits don't fit and, from the looks of their hair, it appears they're trying to protect the price of oil all by themselves.
6937 2018-08-25 23:19:23 I love when non driving/Clueless car owners put up pics of them with they're car and all they doing is touching with a rag being like "I put in so much work uhhhhh yeahhh" and I'm like. Yo. You never in your life even did an oil change.

6992 2018-08-25 23:11:55 I want people in there willing to loosen regs so more people can have a job. It’s a balancing act. I believe they will do just fine. I’m sick of regulation strangling our coal and oil industries.

7002 2018-08-25 23:11:18 That graph takes gas prices around the country and works out an average price. Of course gas prices are going to vary from town to town but averaging them all out is what the graph is displaying. The price of a barrel of oil has gone up 33% due to Dumbos actions!

Now he wants answers?

7013 2018-08-25 23:09:28 It’s a healthy debate that is well worth following.  My late grandmother used coconut oil whenever her recipe called for oil, but she always used it sparingly, and she never deep-fried anything.
7014 2018-08-25 23:09:18 I would rather oil moves by pipe then by oil car.

7027 2018-08-25 23:07:00 What happened to our reserve. Your friend said Obasanjo paid debt with crude oil @ $54. What happens after that when crude oil was above $100 did PDP paid debt or borrowed other country the money.
Do you think PDP or APC deserve our #PVC
7028 2018-08-25 23:07:00 Venezuela was doing really well under Socialist leader HugoChavez.Probs started when outside influences(such as US)interfered w/oil market prices,as usual Capitalism ruins everything.

7057 2018-08-25 23:02:59 Fossil fuels won't run out in the next 100 years. Neither will crude oil. We effectively have unlimited crude oil at reasonable prices using Fischer-Tropsch. But we'll never even get that far because battery technology will improve during that time frame.

7065 2018-08-25 23:01:55 Olive oil has become a nightmare for the #EU becoming the top source of agriculture fraud. There’s multiple testing processes to determine if the purity matches labeling.

7070 2018-08-25 23:01:40 I run the spring-y oil ones on most of my lines now. 760 mm Hg ones on the vacuum line for super-sensitive and weird gas chemistry. Would prefer Hg on all of them though.

7091 2018-08-25 22:58:29 It really is a way to make cake more moist & more delicious. It’s just eggs & oil, two things in most cake recipes anyway. I’d agree that for a butter cake, it might not work, because you don’t want to kill the butter flavor. For every other cake, it works.
7092 2018-08-25 22:58:04 Watching the Phillies the last two weeks is like watching the last two years of Amy Winehouse’s life.  They’ll be found laying on the shower floor with puddles of coconut oil around them.

7094 2018-08-25 22:57:05 We keep hearing data is the new oil. Inspired by @DavidBCollum 's tweet yesterday, I think data storage, analysis enhanced by computing technology is the new enthalpy of the current IT revolution. Not sure if it is reducing entropy though.

7103 2018-08-25 22:55:30 Paul, it would be fantastic if people stopped eating animals. No literature in the world is going to turn the mind of people who do not care about animal welfare. You eat vegan products off the supermarket shelf right? Most of the ones I've come across contain palm oil - a killer
7104 2018-08-25 22:55:29 Olive oil softens the ear wax so it comes out on its own easier! But I typically don't have ear wax problems & I just wipe away the stuff outside, I use qtips to clean the rest of the ear though I just don't put them in my ear (I did as a kid though!)

7110 2018-08-25 22:54:09 Polymer clay can dry up and become extremely crumbly but you can always get it back to a workable state with some baby oil. I’d be too scared now to work with any other type of clay! 
7111 2018-08-25 22:53:58 I borrowed a 38A Range Rover 4.6 from work for a weekend and I have to say, given that it was an engineering car, it was pretty nifty. A year or two later I had an L322 with the 4.4 V8 diesel and it was different class. From the lights it was scary, especially for an oil burner.
7112 2018-08-25 22:53:56 I just use a damp warm clothes & if they're really clogged I use warm olive oil bc I have read waaay too many q-tip horror stories of people accidentally puncturing their ear drums at worst, or compacting the earwax worse by pushing it in at best
7113 2018-08-25 22:53:53 Eu estive num evento sobre commodities e a percepção geral é que o preço de médio prazo para Oil é menor, por causa do crescimento de produção nos EUA. Qual o preço que viabilizou o terceiro equipamento?
7114 2018-08-25 22:53:31 Why of course, it’s FUD from Norwegian Big Oil interests
7115 2018-08-25 22:53:26 Like i previously said, Oil naturally existed. It was 'Discovered'. What are we supposed to be thankful to the arabs for ? I assume you are an Arab? What are your thoughts on mohammad bin qasim ? Just curious.

We don't want to have our coastlines placed at risk for the benefit of companies who's continued existence relys upon finding new places to extract oil from. And we...

7120 2018-08-25 22:52:19 Can’t Iran sell oil to get money?
7121 2018-08-25 22:52:14 Literally just that! I’ve been so shocked that it works. I use rosehip oil also as a moisturizer but I’ve always used that one
7122 2018-08-25 22:52:09 Don’t forget the chapstick girl!!I desperately wish I would have brought some peppermint essential oil to put under my nose for my nauseaI puked through my whole labor
7123 2018-08-25 22:51:59 That would really work. Or even a drizzle of chilli oil.
7124 2018-08-25 22:51:57 Absolutely. Cast Iron, canola oil, knob of butter

7133 2018-08-25 22:50:22 My uncle already paid to fix some stuff earlier in the year. It’s not throwing any codes but I’m already overdrawn behind on other things so I cant even change the oil atm to decide if we’re still dealing with the same problem we were.
7134 2018-08-25 22:50:14 This guy sounds like a snake oil salesman. Isn’t he the guy who covered up sex abuse allegations at IOSU?  Like this windbag has credibility. @CNN @washingtonpost @nytimes
7135 2018-08-25 22:50:12 I love this for an easy brunch. But where do you get smoked olive oil?

7139 2018-08-25 22:48:59 So is cannabis oil liquid legal now? If so , where can I buy it and get the correct doses, what I’ve learnt from similar medication is not great so Im trying this as it has less side effects
7140 2018-08-25 22:48:57 I feel so responsible - decided not to go to the movies and instead put on @YesikaStarr's Ponte A Limpiar playlist on spotify y me puse a limpiar. Got my house smelling like orange essential oil

7145 2018-08-25 22:48:34 I been using like amber white oil for years. Ain't no smell better than that
7146 2018-08-25 22:48:13 I live in Los Angeles. I tell patients after any surgery to use CBD oil or edibles...because they already do anyway.
7147 2018-08-25 22:48:03 Boy, is that right. We are so screwed. Damn the Dump voters who fell for the snake oil salesmen.
7148 2018-08-25 22:47:47 Our daughter learned about 999 and I learned about a home cooking oil fire - thank you for a great day 
7149 2018-08-25 22:47:10 Nice moon out tonight crew. Moonbathing. Is that a thing? That's where we're at. Our jaz has been round wi sum fresh oil he's had going on. Nice touch.

7151 2018-08-25 22:47:02 Gf, take some medicine, rub some Vick’s on yourself, if you have a oil diffuser get that poppin with eucalyptus and sleep it off.
7152 2018-08-25 22:46:45 beard oil ....i love the smell
7153 2018-08-25 22:46:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

7155 2018-08-25 22:45:51 It's sesame oil ramen and I added extra garlic, chilli oil, chicken, and spring onions. It was delicious.

7158 2018-08-25 22:44:43 CBD is extracted from cannabis as either an oil or powder. These can be mixed into creams or gels.

7159 2018-08-25 22:44:33 Energy boom? Coal and oil is 19th and 20th century technology. Solar, wind are renewable and cleaner. The only people who are tying in are the 1% and corporate raiders who are profiting from this admins scurrilous practices. You’re a pack of environmental Luddites hugging the oil

7165 2018-08-25 22:43:29 We had mozzarella and peach (and diced red onion) salad for lunch today. Just a drizzle of olive oil over. Yum!!!
7166 2018-08-25 22:42:54 So what's the actual verdict on coconut oil? Most international dietary  guidelines recommend enjoying saturated fats in moderation. As the  saying goes, the dose makes the poison, so if you do have a soft spot  for coconut oil just take care not to overindulge.

7178 2018-08-25 22:40:13 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
7179 2018-08-25 22:40:10 Lavender oil. It takes the burn away really quickly.

7182 2018-08-25 22:39:50 My nipples had sores and open wounds that couldn't heal bc she cluster fed and I was screaming and begging for formula (it hurt worse than birth) and I put coconut oil inside the shields and put them on to protect my nips while she ate. Hold on I'll send pix
7183 2018-08-25 22:39:48 Corporate tax cuts are good for job growth

Getting out of the Paris Accord was a good thing

Oil should be transported inside a pipeline

Obamacare is bad. The pre-existing condition mandate banned all existing policies caused prices for less desirable HD plans to go way up.
7184 2018-08-25 22:39:45 I use my glow oil at night. One or two relaxing essential oils wey Dey inside. You fit just mumu during the day if you use it.

7186 2018-08-25 22:39:14 @Zendaya why does the vitamin E oil make my eyes n nose run like crazy :))
7187 2018-08-25 22:39:11 Now is the time to work on clean air and better standards so we don’t keep having these disasters. People die...deregulating coal and drilling for oil to get a few people rich isn’t worth the lives it will end
7188 2018-08-25 22:38:55 I remember someone saying they used mayonnaise on their hair. Olive oil is another one but it's pretty expensive! 
7189 2018-08-25 22:37:57 Again I re emphasize “ the world is awashed with so much oil... Most of it is worthless and would remain worthless” ...

7192 2018-08-25 22:36:56 Splattering hot oil is hot.
7193 2018-08-25 22:36:31 Looking back fondly on that long distance email-only dating experience.. with that guy on the oil rig.. whose satellite phone never worked.. with strangely polite and misspelled english... and how he got scared off when I asked him to send me money to help me buy a new phone 
7194 2018-08-25 22:36:28 I told you to keep a check on your oil and to bring it back to me so I could fix that O ring. But you never listen 
7195 2018-08-25 22:36:27 Cannabis oil...
the miracle cure!
I would not be walking without it!
Cannabis oil also cured skin cancer!  
After experiencing immediate relief I wonder why it is so controlled?
Then I learned about Bush drug industry!
7196 2018-08-25 22:36:13 Phew, at least you don't mind clean energy. The fossil fuel industry is huge, oil/fracking/pipelines and the elite all own these companies.  They are the ones that are stopping the transitional approach of switching to clean energy.  It's always about the money.
7197 2018-08-25 22:35:48 Oil field workers are the strangest ppl. They spend all day and night with dudes and dress like females...
7198 2018-08-25 22:35:38 ^___^
7199 2018-08-25 22:35:27 Heated up olive oil wtf?
7200 2018-08-25 22:34:36 We need allies to support sanctions on oil.
7201 2018-08-25 22:34:30 After insulting every Black voter in America we're never going to vote for the Snake Oil Salesman. Never Every.
7202 2018-08-25 22:34:24 I'm counting the days to September 1st. I fucking refuse to order heating oil before then. Christ alive it's cold!
7203 2018-08-25 22:34:12 Does castor oil even really work like that
7204 2018-08-25 22:33:31 Me: why am I breaking out

7205 2018-08-25 22:33:26 If you need a oil change hit me up  stupid plug
7206 2018-08-25 22:33:07 Oil pan is still leaking.

7209 2018-08-25 22:32:41 Yeah that might’ve been what happened. Dogs can’t get it but they can spread it oil gets all over their fur. It’s miserable stuff please keep an eye on  it if it gets worse go to the doctor
7210 2018-08-25 22:32:25 This is what I like.  If the conservative vote splits who gives a flying f*ck. The Republic of Western Canada is formed and Quebec can pay for their own daycare, education and foreign oil.
7211 2018-08-25 22:32:24 would roast w/ a simple olive oil, s/p, garlic, onion mix. wait. what.
7212 2018-08-25 22:32:15 Go for extra virgin oil whenever you can.

7222 2018-08-25 22:30:28 Sometimes I want to just give Trump and his base Alaska if they'd all go. Oil, white people, guns galore, Russia proximity. Sorry Alaska.
7223 2018-08-25 22:30:26 That's so neat! And yeah I love tea tree oil and aloe, and I also try and make sure none of my skincare products have alcohol. I had to say goodbye to my fave sunscreen because it had such a high alcohol content!
7224 2018-08-25 22:30:25 Make sure to negotiate payment of the wall by Mexico too. If Mexico can't come up with the money we can negotiate for oil drilling rights in their waters and on their land to fund the Wall. #BuildTheWall

7232 2018-08-25 22:29:33 Uh @DeltaSonicWash, I think y’all took my tire valve caps when I got my oil changed Thursday... cuz I don’t have them on my car anymore 
7233 2018-08-25 22:29:29 Yeah but have you smelt Sunday Riley’s Artemis oil?!?! Boak.
7234 2018-08-25 22:29:20 Tbf Rob, you do look like someone who’s previously had acid in their face? 

I mean I’m no oil painting myself but...
7235 2018-08-25 22:29:04 Oil and water will never mix and neither will Islam and Christianity.  A simple fact of life.
7236 2018-08-25 22:29:04 SHUT DOWN YOUR SO CALLED INDUSTRY OF CORRUPTION AND LIES YOU KNOW VERY WELL THERE ARE METHODS OF  ENERGY RESOURCES THAT DON'T REQUIRE OIL OR GAS , AND YOU HAVE KNOWN THIS SINCE THE BEGINING OF TIME

7238 2018-08-25 22:28:56 Lots of natural tea tree oil, white tea extracts, aloe, grape seed and milk proteins based products. 
Most importantly, natural. No chemicals and alcohol

7242 2018-08-25 22:28:39 This is so wrong. Kuwait is probably 90% from oil. Where is the other 56% coming from?
7243 2018-08-25 22:28:29 Is it home made Nutella? Commercial Nutella’s full of palm oil.
7244 2018-08-25 22:28:23 Salad oil is just any vegetable oil that’s mild in flavor (usually canola)
7245 2018-08-25 22:28:18 Do they dry the oils first ??? Or is olive oil really just olive juice
7246 2018-08-25 22:28:16 Shaving with coconut oil is a hard yes

It has a chaine so you don't have to worry about replacing a timing belt.
Really good on gas !
I'm selling because I'm buying new one
7252 2018-08-25 22:27:29 More oil and more coal while other poorer countries know better and are going with wind and solar. As well as many other alternative sources of energy. Your plan @realDonaldTrump is purely greed driven.
7253 2018-08-25 22:27:06 If you like them so much "save them."Reducing the size of our National Forest for drilling oil does not mean you like them! Shows me you like $$$ and oil.
7254 2018-08-25 22:26:10 It does. You’re low on oil. Get it topped up or the engine will seize.
7255 2018-08-25 22:25:45 Tomorrow. You let the cat OUT of the bag. Although NASCAR thoughts were the clincher. Nice knowin ya!
7256 2018-08-25 22:25:34 Wow you didn't buy my beard oil....

Wowww
7257 2018-08-25 22:25:15 My husbands family is in oil. The oil industry is cyclical. Always will be. Obama was not responsible for international oil prices. Neither is Trump.

7264 2018-08-25 22:24:29 I use palm oil for my stew when I plan to use iru (locust beans),dry fish or vegetable.
Summarily, I love palm oil stew more. 
Na city thought me how to use veg oil.
7265 2018-08-25 22:24:08 Follow you to the oil and gas industry? Are we going to the olive oil and beans processing plants.
7266 2018-08-25 22:23:44 My mom keeps telling me my cars leaking oil, but there no mf oil puddles under my car so likeeeeeeeee wtf is she on
7267 2018-08-25 22:23:33 But like how is oil made 
7268 2018-08-25 22:23:09 does it not mean check the oil lol
7269 2018-08-25 22:23:02 That's such a lie. "Environmentally" is a nice touch. There was nothing "so-called" about the plan. Everything about oil and coal is filthy - from their extraction, to their refinement, their transportation, and their burning. You can try to undo progress, but you won't succeed.
7270 2018-08-25 22:23:01 The beards oil smells so awful. I can only apply it when I'm done going out for the day
7271 2018-08-25 22:23:00 Muslims are terrorists they should be locked up or deported why are they in America America is a Christian nation Christians and Muslims do not mix oil and water do not mix  If you’re not Muslim and don’t convert then they want to remove your Christian head that’s a terrorist
7272 2018-08-25 22:22:44 He gimanasih kenapa hahahaha. Mb beli minyak oil lg ah aku kecanduan bahaya
7273 2018-08-25 22:22:42 Which is a excellent place to spend oil royalties.  Not tax cuts to robber barons of industry
7274 2018-08-25 22:22:31 There’s always another snake oil Nazi  around every corner . Don’t get me wrong , I’ll rejoice if Trump does a stretch . I just can’t see a rich white collar dude who pretended to be ‘ president ‘ being relegated to incarceration .
7275 2018-08-25 22:22:29 Please have him try CBD oil it has cured so many cancers it’s worth a try please
7276 2018-08-25 22:22:25 Lmao. On a scale of 1 to 10 , how illiterate are you? Arabs did not ‘MAKE’ oil, it was existent. The British discovered it. The technology to drill and extract came from the west. So what are we crediting Arabs for? Being born ?
7277 2018-08-25 22:22:13 I bit into a mozzarella stick and hot oil squirted up my nostril. AMA.
7278 2018-08-25 22:22:04 So not only is big oil against Tesla but insurance companies are too. Wake up 
7279 2018-08-25 22:22:04 Stir the oil is ready to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.
7280 2018-08-25 22:22:02 Enough oil 
7281 2018-08-25 22:22:01 Don't forget about @realDonaldTrump other achievements.
- Out of Paris Accord
- Crushed Turkish lira w/ tweet

7282 2018-08-25 22:21:55 He’s leaking oil, just like the other 3 starters...
7283 2018-08-25 22:21:48 Also, a lot of phosphorous and sulfur are separated from the oil/sludge and those are fertilizer feedstocks that are hard to replace.

We're in need of technological development to change sources there.
7284 2018-08-25 22:21:41 Think....Who singularly is the most destructive Force of the American Democracy..fixed elections..NSA..drug dealing high oil pricing public service with big money brain implants lazer weapons..the man's name is Jackson Thomas Stephens..who sent an attractive female to mother
7285 2018-08-25 22:21:34 The 5yo's favorite food is crusty baguette dipped in garlic-salty olive oil, but she won't eat the crust on a regular sandwich. 
So looking forward to lunchbox season.
7286 2018-08-25 22:21:10 You left out the master OIL
7287 2018-08-25 22:21:07 You can look into Kratom and CBD oil or edibles. They're legal in all states and doesn't get you high. You can get kratom at smoke shops, but you need to read and educate yourself on that, depending on what you need it for. Some are good for depression, others for pain
7288 2018-08-25 22:21:07 Get new tires and an oil change or get these Browns / Steelers tickets.
7289 2018-08-25 22:21:03 The voice of divine reason.

"On June 9, Pope Francis met with oil executives at the Vatican. “Civilization requires energy, but energy must not destroy civilization,” he said in his address".

7291 2018-08-25 22:19:54 I'm not certain about the oilsands percentage because it's not like "oil" is a homogeneous chemical that can be used in many ways, it's a goop of many different hydrocarbons that get cracked/separated into different densities that do different polymers.  

It varies by deposit.
7292 2018-08-25 22:19:49 “Pro-tip: don’t drink oil.”
7293 2018-08-25 22:19:48 I served in the army with people of Arab descent whose language skills were key. Arabs comprise a huge part of the oil & gas workforce in Houston, a major contributor to the US economy. McCain ‘s defense of Obama was well-intentioned, but fell short.
7294 2018-08-25 22:19:10 we had no guerrilla, our own (national) oil industry, refineries around the world, a large network of petrol stations in US. it was the 2nd largest oil company only second to te giant mobile-exxon. it was only the 5th largest oil producer...everything was added value!
7295 2018-08-25 22:19:05 I ended up getting the standard edition. I forgot I have an oil change coming in that I need to work into my budget. 
7296 2018-08-25 22:19:01 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
7297 2018-08-25 22:18:58 I'm a personal chef & know a little about food history. During WWII, eggs & butter were in short supply. Since mayo is made from eggs & oil, food companies came up with cake recipes for home cooks that subbed in mayo, which was readily available. That's how mayo got in cake.
7298 2018-08-25 22:18:56 The place we get our oil changed includes a car wash, inside and out. Plus it’s the cheapest place we’ve found.

7300 2018-08-25 22:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
7301 2018-08-25 22:18:38 Got asked by an old lady today if we sell CBD oil at the pharmacy 
7302 2018-08-25 22:18:35 He does have a point. If palm oil alone was banned they would use something else. To make the same amount of oil would need more forest. So, cut all oils / promote bans for all deforesters. Palm oil has always been there, but wasn't a problem until it was...
7303 2018-08-25 22:18:27 That’s right cause they are sponsored, but it is extremely important for regular players as well as it would be an oil change for your car whether you’re a Toyota Camry or a Porsche 911
7304 2018-08-25 22:18:19 Over the years I’ve let go of a lot of prized t-shirts. My daughters have hijacked a few as well (”I voted for Bill and Opus”, a Midnight Oil tour shirt, and some dragons; good taste :-). I turned some of the last into quilts for them.
7305 2018-08-25 22:18:18 I got a new essential oil called Humility. It's really stinky, so I put it in my work bag to smell as punishment whenever I'm grumpy with asshole nurses.
7306 2018-08-25 22:18:13 Mayo = eggs + oil. Eggs + oil + sugar + milk = cake. What's the issue?
7307 2018-08-25 22:18:04 Yeah that's what my partner does! You like, heat up olive oil, use a dropper to get a couple drops in, let it sit for like 10-15 mins I think? And then like just flush w water
7308 2018-08-25 22:17:53 All I want is an avocado with a lil olive oil drizzle 
7309 2018-08-25 22:17:43 Yeah right, also oil and water mix... She's just as dirty but in a time when she was protected because of her network ..

7310 2018-08-25 22:17:41 Conditioner and Oils my preference is Jamaican Castor oil
7311 2018-08-25 22:17:31 Once upon a time, salt was a very valuable commodity. Anyone who had excess salt had power. But then things like canning and refrigeration came along. Now salt is... basically for flavor (still used some in preserving). Coal and oil rule the roost.... but do they have to?
7312 2018-08-25 22:17:27 Eeee, nor use ur eyes comot oil from my body oooh

7314 2018-08-25 22:17:08 We've had a very dry summer though, all that oil (or whatever it is) will still be in the tarmac. Suspect it'll be much better after winter.
7315 2018-08-25 22:16:56 I can't help DNC announcement is akin to an abusive ex giving flowers.  They just beat the shit out of progressives by allowing oil donations, and here all the sudden Progressives seem to magically forget after superdelegate removal.  Oil is the new power structure.
7316 2018-08-25 22:16:50 Got my toes done and tried to go  to the mall right afterwards. Swear I almost slipped right out my sandals all this oil on my feet. Smh.
7317 2018-08-25 22:16:47 I only used the moisturiser though  my holy grail cleanser will always be the tea tree oil range

7321 2018-08-25 22:15:41 Classic! This is the reaction you get when telling a 19th century man that one can get more power from a glass of ocean water than a glass of oil.
7322 2018-08-25 22:15:37 If you don't spend time with #God, the oil in your lamp will go out.
7323 2018-08-25 22:15:30 It seems logical that the vegetable oils are the cause of the obesity epidemic after watching Dr. Eades talk but as he says it's only an opinion. It would be great if a impartial study of the effects of vegetable oil could be done.

7328 2018-08-25 22:15:07 Should we have intervened when Pol Pot murdered millions? When Idi Amin slaughtered his own? Ethnic cleansing in Serbia? Somalia? Yes, VietNam was geopolitical bullshit. Iraq was an attempted oil grab. Failed imperialism does not mean true existential threats end at our borders.

7334 2018-08-25 22:13:39 Push an oil exec under a train, chain yourself to the gates at a fracking site, attach limpet mines to Japanese whaling vessels that sort of thing.
7335 2018-08-25 22:13:32 Oil money needed
7336 2018-08-25 22:13:30 Not that fancy oils are great. Just saying VO5 hot oil wasn’t actually oil based.
7337 2018-08-25 22:13:26 Am no oil painting myself and I'm all for girls sticking together blah blah but I find it rather fucking offensive when my boyf likes girls pics that are absolute chavy dogs, absolute cunt flap face he's gonna get a slap
7338 2018-08-25 22:13:25 I had the extreme migraines.  Blindness, numb hands and face, pins and needles in my tongue.  I have not taken a pill for them in over 2 years.  Cbd oil is the key, not from hemp but mj extraction.
7339 2018-08-25 22:13:15 I second acupuncture! Also peppermint oil can help
7340 2018-08-25 22:13:13 Felix once made my father paint him an oil painting of our Henry Hoover. It hung above his bed for several years.

7343 2018-08-25 22:12:30 It will be impossible for the UK to operate on such tariff/quotas for things like olive oil. Eight countries have already objected to the UK's piggyback proposal. (3)
7344 2018-08-25 22:12:06 i’m confused as to how niggas have terrible looking ass feet. like, nigga are you not washing your shit or you work in the oil fields?
7345 2018-08-25 22:11:56 I need to wash my car later , rotate my tires, and get an oil change.  Greatttt
7346 2018-08-25 22:11:44 When I replaced the oil separator valve, it was a $100 part that required me to disassemble half the top of the engine.
7347 2018-08-25 22:11:31 Try small amounts of coconut oil bb it will help with itching, scaring and it is one of few moisturizers that won’t draw the ink from the skin
7348 2018-08-25 22:11:27 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease.
7349 2018-08-25 22:11:27 Convenience store? Based on the oil out front and the gas pumps you can see in the reflection of the window in the picture..... I'd say this was a gas station.... Lucky they didn't go through a gas pump....
7350 2018-08-25 22:11:13 FYI...energy boom means going forward with the current trend of energy innovation...

7351 2018-08-25 22:11:10 I don’t think I’ve checked it since I bought my car unless they do it during the oil change lol
7352 2018-08-25 22:10:58 all those biggest economy they were feeding us with,were all fallacy, don't be deceived. it was in the 80s we had a great economy b4 the discovery of oil. It now Buhari is trying to diversify the economy.
7353 2018-08-25 22:10:33 Hopefully they find oil and create new habitat for fish and other critters, like the platforms in GOM do.
7354 2018-08-25 22:10:24 The UK has suggested 'piggybacking' the EU's existing schedules, which contain tariffs and quotas on things like citrus fruit and olive oil, goods unlikely to be UK domestic production. (2)

7369 2018-08-25 22:08:44 This completely unnecessary extra step in the Chevy's oil change brought to you by Detroit, where the only thing they have in common with all the other carmakers is the use of 10mm bolts.
7370 2018-08-25 22:08:41 But mayo IS eggs and oil.
7371 2018-08-25 22:08:19 This happened to me in December, overnight. I used the gentle magic toner, cream and oil to get rid of the spots. They disappeared overtime

7376 2018-08-25 22:06:51 So I got my oil changed this morning and my car broke down on the side of 95 so I had to walk a mile to the cottman ave exit. Now I'm sitting in a fucking gas station trying to get a hold of someone to pick me up

7385 2018-08-25 22:04:19 It would have moved our energy toward clean energy which would not only save money but would have given us energy independence and disengaged us in those areas of the world where oil holds us hostage.  
However, the @GOP wouldn't have gotten their big payouts from oil corps.
7386 2018-08-25 22:04:09 My comment was a joke and referring to the fact that not all vegan food are healthy. The beyond meat burger is not healthy as well and it contains coconut oil which is extremely unhealthy and full of saturated fat. There are thousands of other healthy options.

7404 2018-08-25 22:00:44 Exactly.  No healing this rift.  It will be “screw democrats regardless”.  It’s so bad that flyover country should consider not selling the food we grow, the oil we pump to any blue county.  Screw them exist without us.
7405 2018-08-25 22:00:29 Using mayo in cakes dates back to the Depression & WWII when ingredients could be scarce and cooks had to get creative. It's just eggs, oil and a little acid. When done right you get a cake that is rich, moist and not overly sweet.

7412 2018-08-25 21:59:42 Hella Epsom salt, baking soda, apple cider vinegar and some coconut oil. Nothing too wild.
7413 2018-08-25 21:59:24 They still do that in various ways. In Alaska set-netters are losing their traditional lands to rising sea water and are not allowed subsistence fishing on federal lands. But oil drilling and foreign mining is welcome.

7429 2018-08-25 21:56:11 Lol. I’ve done it before. I know is not great. I don’t do it to the extreme. No way I’m stuffing myself with so much fats and oil
7430 2018-08-25 21:56:02 I imagine that you are an oil painting
7431 2018-08-25 21:55:52 means my pockets thicker than da bible.... need an oil change?
7432 2018-08-25 21:55:45 My mom has all her essential oil diffusers going, which is nice. But these fumes are not great for ya girls allergies. 
7433 2018-08-25 21:55:45 Yeah after imposing more vat on oil products our economy will GREATLY improve. Patriots like me are very optimistic

7438 2018-08-25 21:55:13 You forgot Germany. Ancient name was Assyria. Our one time ally is in bed with Russia especially now since Trump is in office. That's what that handy dandy oil pipeline from Russia to Germany. With the exception of Great Britain we will have NO friends in the new Roman Empire.
7439 2018-08-25 21:55:05 Black seed oil is the truth!
I haven't taken it in a few days.  Took a cap full this morning and it loosened the phlegm or dander that was in my chest...
7440 2018-08-25 21:55:04 A healthy breakfast, but don't eat too much. Eat whole grains, such as whole-grain bread. Eat healthy fats, such as olive oil and nuts.
7441 2018-08-25 21:54:53 You know therse a REAL way to settle this! 2 travelers enter one traveler leaves. OIL up! I will set it up!
7442 2018-08-25 21:54:49 I’m not aware there is any oil in Gaza. If there was I think the left wouldn’t be moaning about the unemployment rate there etc etc.

7444 2018-08-25 21:53:27 Oh, common, you can't be serious? #justinTrudeau is one of the few brave politicians of our time and you increase this hate and pore more oil I to the fire. #notVeryPeacful
7445 2018-08-25 21:53:08 Here's my occasional treat: Bed of lettuce, (gotta be canned) peaches or pears or both, topped with Catalina dressing, currently the Litehouse brand version, "Sweet French." Litehouse doesn't use high fructose syrup. Nor soybean oil. I prefer not to either one of those.

7450 2018-08-25 21:52:13 No one appreciates my cooking: Herbed chicken, zucchini noodles, fresh cherry tomatoes & basil from the garden, bocconcini & parmesan cheeses, garlic & olive oil.
7451 2018-08-25 21:51:29 Why did I never try baked zucchini with ranch before that shit is good. Actually, zucchini baked with olive oil and bread crumbs alone is good.
7452 2018-08-25 21:51:27 Ah? Now I'm a PQ supporter. So I guess you're just allowed to make stuff up now. Ok. Just so you know: being against bloody tar sands oil dors not make someone a member of a political party. Do you serve the same bad arguments to ontarians that don't share your love of your oil?

7465 2018-08-25 21:49:00 Yeah..i think it's sesame oil too..
7466 2018-08-25 21:48:09 I’ve never had coconut oil in my home in my lifetime.  But, I was aware of its use in cooking.  What else is there?

7470 2018-08-25 21:46:19 @American_Heart how much money was involved for American Heart Association to declare that coconut oil is bad for your health....
7471 2018-08-25 21:46:06 Social media and big tech are the oil barons of the 21 century. They’re monopolies in need of regulation.

7475 2018-08-25 21:45:36 Being an adult is finding out you have extra money and get excited to get those shoes you want but realize you have to get an oil change with it instead

7477 2018-08-25 21:45:16 Who knew the oil fields would lead the way?
7478 2018-08-25 21:45:11 Can't support or uphold things that fly-in-face of TRUTH, HONOR, INTEGRITY. Selling weapons to Saudis to EXTERMINATE Innocents in Yemen was just TOO MUCH to ignore. Lying about #Syria when he wants their OIL. "Fighting Terror" in Afghanistan when he wants POPPY-FIELDS. No way!
7479 2018-08-25 21:45:09 I took my car to get its oil changed this morning and now I’m starting to see auto parts/service ads online. I’m shook.

7485 2018-08-25 21:44:52 Canada is our largest source of foreign oil, little over 30%.
That Reuters poll has been discredited as the sample size was too small to be statistically relevant. Trump's approval rating is around 9% for African Americans.

MS-13 gang members number around 10,000, making it less than 1% of the estimated 1.3M gang members nationwide. There are approximately 13,000 Crips in LA, more than than numbers of MS-13 nationwide.

7494 2018-08-25 21:43:36 Apartments of that height are so much more interesting than something on the 82nd floor that give you a view of the oil refineries on the Turnpike and the burbs stretching out in every direction

7500 2018-08-25 21:42:39 I don't recall anyone calling for a half measure on super delegates.

But I didn't recall anyone calling for the DNC to rig the primary in 2016 or to go back to taking money from big oil either...

It's like a crook saying he'll still rob you but with less bullets in the gun...
7501 2018-08-25 21:42:37 This is simply cruel. A large pot of scorching oil seems 2 b the appropriate action for this inhumane act! I need 2 find an island large enough 2 accommodate me & all animals. The land fruitful, home of the most exotic beaches, bareness is common, death & barbarism does not exit!
7502 2018-08-25 21:42:36 Take it easy brah, burn midnight oil sometimes, and keep at it. Everything is easy to do, you just don't know how to do it yet, and that's fine.
7503 2018-08-25 21:42:31 Haha. You're thinking of EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil). Evo Hemp stands for next EVOlutionary step in our industrial and agricultural rEVOlutions.
7504 2018-08-25 21:42:19 Croatian oil is rarely mixed or fake, but we don't really export it en massee

7506 2018-08-25 21:41:47 Disregard everything that he wrote. What he meant to say was, Republicans will continue to do what it takes to make the rich wealthier while overlooking all other Americans. We will also allow oil companies to spill on in your areas while keeping them out of our neighborhoods
7507 2018-08-25 21:41:38 Thanks. I haven’t tried either of them but I will! I’ve tried she’s butter, coconut oil, etc and nothing is helping.
7508 2018-08-25 21:41:32 Palm oil and beans 
7509 2018-08-25 21:41:21 Oil, yes! Any day come on by!!!!! 
7510 2018-08-25 21:41:20 Use some oil instead or aloe vera 
7511 2018-08-25 21:41:10 I’m completely anti- war and anti- weapons. So, very confused that you’d like me to call out Dems when the Republican agenda is very pro-NRA, pro-war, pro- oil, anti-environment and advocating deregulation’s for environment and wildlife... you seem to have a big heart...
7512 2018-08-25 21:41:09 Matter of fact when I go to buy motor oil filter at @Walmart I always open the box to make sure the Fram filter has not been switched for a cheaper filter. It does happen often trust me.
7513 2018-08-25 21:41:03 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

If U can't hear,U can see,if u can't see,u can feel,if u can't with any,U are as DISHONEST as PDP.

7517 2018-08-25 21:40:30 I bought some good avocado olive and coconut oil. My therapist’s prescription. It’s amazing the teachers I’ve had... i’m sure this guy is an undercover holistic doctor not just a massage therapist.  They don’t wear gi’s/degrees and black belt’s but they are fucking masters.

7522 2018-08-25 21:39:51 If you owned a car and then decided this wasn’t enough and then you went and brought the oil and petroleum and then the road it was driven on . Then you decided that you wanted the tyre manufacturer and then the manufacturer of the car ? call that a parasite or Uber or blackrock

7535 2018-08-25 21:37:04 If women ran the world, everyone would be on the same cycle and there would be peace.
Then the machines would need their oil changed, and it would all grind to a halt.
7536 2018-08-25 21:36:56 you know the seasons changing when your coconut oil starts getting hard
7537 2018-08-25 21:36:54 I don't believe in monocropping - it's absolutely destructive. GMO crops, palm oil etc. are a huge NO. Ethical vegan - do no harm to the earth. If you see a vegan eating Oreos, take the box & smack them on the head with it.
7538 2018-08-25 21:36:48 Just did my first oil change  
7539 2018-08-25 21:36:23 The strange thing is, we have to put these stickers on (makes sense) but the don't leave a 'void' mark on removal (makes no sense). Can hardly try it out, but reckon a bit of cooking oil would remove adhesive entirely.

-Lowered taxes
-Right to try
-Cut 24,000 federal jobs, 
-Oil exports up-energy indep.
-NK denuclearization, soldiers remains returned

7555 2018-08-25 21:34:06 And don’t let their collusion with CAPP support by Royalties slide! Fracking for gas/oil is killing our waters and supporting the Tar Sands that is already subsided by the Alberta NDP!
7556 2018-08-25 21:34:04 I'm in the "trust but verify" stage with olive oil. if i can't (if i wanted) walk thru the whole supply chain i look for one i can, even if i maybe only spot check parts

(I'm the same way with grassfed meat and raw dairy and eggs etc etc)
7557 2018-08-25 21:33:36 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water!

7559 2018-08-25 21:33:18 Answering the phone with your hands covered in fish oil then going back to serve the fish is not hygienic. Who knows who last picked up the phone and what products they had on their hands?
7560 2018-08-25 21:33:15 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.

7562 2018-08-25 21:33:08 8 years ago I wrote jamb to become a Geologist so I will chop oil money.

7566 2018-08-25 21:32:30 Not a vegan but your statement is ridiculous. Raising cattle for beef is the single most environmentally destructive agricultural practice in the world. Bar none. Or Google the destruction of forests for palm oil plantations for cosmetics & processed food. Geez.
7567 2018-08-25 21:32:21 I bought some CBD oil to try it out on my joints. I hope it works.
7568 2018-08-25 21:32:21 And isn’t it true that Venezuela, which has one of largest deposits of oil in the world, their major source of income, is prevented from selling on international markets by US sanctions!
7569 2018-08-25 21:32:12 walked into a health food store wearing sandals and green linen pants so i could buy cbd oil.......that’s just my life now
7570 2018-08-25 21:31:54 Don’t think socialism and Jeremy Corbyn are jokes, look to the utopia of Venezuela - they can’t feed themselves, citizens are leaving the country and eating pets to survive yet it is rich with oil. Enjoy your utopia. #JeremyCorbyn #SocialistSunday
7571 2018-08-25 21:31:27 People for the problems of a whole. China in fact right now is faring down rainforests in Latin America for oil pipelines and constantly destroying fisheries with japan. So please stop. This has zero to do with race and more to do with late stage capitalism aka neoliberalism.
7572 2018-08-25 21:30:53 Started taking coconut oil bathes and it is the best! I definitely recommend it
7573 2018-08-25 21:30:50 For export as well. Extra virgin olive oil is one of our crown jewels (the other is high grade cork that never spoils the wine). I should send you a bottle of Gallo.
7574 2018-08-25 21:30:49 Scandinavia has some of the most robust & expansive social services including free healthcare, free higher education & for some countries up to 2 year parental leave. The government of Norway also owns the largest(or one of the largest) oil companies-Statoil. state-run.

7595 2018-08-25 21:27:35 yes California has very strict testing guidelines. By contrast the EU has NO guidelines for export. Almost all olive oil exported from Italy/Greece etc. is not real
7596 2018-08-25 21:27:25 Fine if you make your own with cider vinegar and a good olive oil.
7597 2018-08-25 21:27:20 Dont use palm oil.
7598 2018-08-25 21:27:05 The answer is oil lobbies.

7600 2018-08-25 21:26:35 I’ll tell you what helped me. I make sure that I dry the fish off as much as possible with paper towels before seasoning. Cooking it in a hot pan with butter and an oil with a high smoke point, like grapeseed oil, helps too.

I cured pneumonia w vitamin c & once kept myself from having a drain for 6-8wks (a cyst) with oregano oil mixture! Swear!
7603 2018-08-25 21:26:02 Does Norway include an entry in it's finances detailing oil/gas income "from unknown sources"? No? Thought not.
7604 2018-08-25 21:25:51 Always remember to the change the oil in your time machine once every 6 months or 3,000 years.
7605 2018-08-25 21:25:42 Ppl annoy me...  Yes they said coconut oil isn't safe to digest,  meaning to cook with or drink in tea.  Keep putting that ish in your hair nd in your skin nd glow up dnt be fooled

She can hear me, can’t she?

I didn’t say anything.

The Saudi alliance is holding a ship # Beria loaded with oil derivatives, and prevents them from entering the port of Al Hudaydah despite obtaining a permit from the United Nations.
7695 2018-08-25 21:13:17 Also CBD oil for pets works wonders. There are lots of YouTube videos of people talking about using it. Good luck.

Salt and water... You for join Maggi and oil make the outcome delicious
7705 2018-08-25 21:11:15 Okay, right? I saw some nonsense on a food site about that and my eyes almost got stuck I rolled them so hard. They said it was to add richness. That is literally why you add eggs and butter or oil to a batter. Adding mayo is utter nonsense.
7706 2018-08-25 21:10:58 LOL, fair enough. They being said look into shave oil. Under 3oz bottles really nice for hotel shaves.
7707 2018-08-25 21:10:32 Good thing I'm always mentally prepared for the "other things" they always suggest to do to the car when I do the oil change. Today: Air filters and clean the fuel injectors.
7708 2018-08-25 21:10:26 Frozen dry chips! A good job there’s only 7 of the pretentious fuckers to contend with. Fish dipped in motor oil & Grandmas vomit to garnish. Topped with Shards glass to stop the complaints. Are you in a care home taking the piss out of vulnerable people or are you mad?

7750 2018-08-25 21:02:41 when Stephen Harper was running to be PM, he didn't announce: "I'm going to muzzle all scientists so they don't talk to the public". It doesn't matter what Conservatives say their policies are. Is what they do when they reach power, usually more oil based energy. #ClimateChange

7764 2018-08-25 20:59:59 The same right-wingers who whipped into a "patriotic" frenzy  over 2 Bush Oil Wars or Vietnam will still fall for what Bloatus sez about NK. Cos a huge portion of the US gets off on war. Why we have 1 or 2 needless ones every dozen years.
7765 2018-08-25 20:59:48 Venezuela's economy was tied to oil (badly); it was the only thing surviving the socialist onslaught of the economy, the differences of bread lines and lines at the apple store is a free market. once the (corrupt) government takes over industry there is no reason to compete.

And spent it on London Vanity Projects.

They gave #Scotland Foodbanks, and PFI hospitals and schools, that our grandchildren will pay for.

7782 2018-08-25 20:57:28 Kudos to the EU if it can find the backbone to stand up to Trump and his sanctions. China will step in an secure Iran"s oil output. What will Trump do? Bluster as always. Russia is already violating the NK oil embargo. Trump doesn't have a clue as to how to play this game.
7783 2018-08-25 20:57:27 I’ll make you some just lemme know when you want it. 
I used baby oil, vanilla extract, and brown sugar.

Ryan radios that there is oil on the track in turn three and we mayyy have hit it based on the look of our roof flap being up  The car is good though, just going to come down pit road during this caution 
7785 2018-08-25 20:57:16 I love the line … it’s not gonna produce more oil… just transfer what we already make. Propaganda

Their is connection. Just as the connection that this administration has with snake oil. Rattle them out.

7799 2018-08-25 20:55:09 Why don't you go short coal or oil then? Just leave Tesla alone to do what they're doing? They are the only company selling a really viable EV, why would you bet on that failing, regardless of your irrational hatred of Elon Musk? It doesn't make sense.
7800 2018-08-25 20:55:08 Looks like some oil on the track.

7807 2018-08-25 20:53:55 Esp the hypocrisy
7808 2018-08-25 20:53:52 I also worked with quite a few Nigerians in the oil industry. They too never experienced racism. Maybe you just suffered abuse because you’re an abrasive character and not because of your race. Maybe you were just unlucky and found one of the few racists.
7809 2018-08-25 20:53:46 Not @ all Brotha, I'm just using the squeaky wheel gets the oil terminology that my Momz taught me. I'm hoping people like myself are using this medium to be heard
7810 2018-08-25 20:53:41 .she said, why are you so slippery "because I wear baby oil"
7811 2018-08-25 20:53:38 Tyler had me take his car to work today and surprised me with an oil change and a full tank of gas.. WHO IS THIS HUMAN???
7812 2018-08-25 20:53:27 Countries that had diversified their economies were fine. Countries like Venezuela who tied most/ all of their economy to oil saw the rapid devaluation of their currency.
7813 2018-08-25 20:53:19 Oil to drop and the pound to rise 
7814 2018-08-25 20:52:38 With chili garlic oil and garlic chips
7815 2018-08-25 20:52:23 @QueensBarrie  just ordered nachos with beef from server Zoey on check #181520.  I am deeply disappointed that they would serve reheated oil soaked chips to customers. What happened to having a standard when serving food to customers. That dish should have never left the kitchen.
7816 2018-08-25 20:52:13 Slap labels on store foods containing palm oil.
"This product kills forests and orangutans."

Act natural  and wear a disguise because it's probably illegal.
7817 2018-08-25 20:52:11 This is similar to what’s happening in Venezuela. Venezuela tide it’s entire economy to oil. Once the US broke the Iran deal, Iran flooded the oil markets which brought down the price per barrel...
7818 2018-08-25 20:52:10 Better than the gun lobbyist, banks, financial orgs, foreign countries, chemical co, big oil- should I keep going because you know dumpster did.

7821 2018-08-25 20:51:56 Yup, because we all know petroleum and Big Oil is the future. Way to represent progressive values and not compromise your integrity by pandering to centrist liberals for votes. Very proud of this government.

7827 2018-08-25 20:51:26 For info, there was a widely used synthetic alternative: hydrogenated vegetable oil. But it was largely abandoned due to health concerns - these 'trans fats' turned out to be even worse for us than saturated animal fats.

7833 2018-08-25 20:50:09 Y’all know Suga is yours. No fight there but do you see the wine in Jay’s  waist. The snake oil!!!
7834 2018-08-25 20:50:08 Also give her palm oil and onions. So the baby won't lack ingredients.
7835 2018-08-25 20:50:02 Thank you for posting this (parody) photo.(NOT!) You know, you just poured oil into the fire of all right-wing parties of the world?
Shame on you, that's not the way how we expect an objective journalism. 
Go an fuck #Salvini's ass!
7836 2018-08-25 20:50:00 got an oil change, bought some horror movies, now getting a pedicure 
7837 2018-08-25 20:49:53 Very sorry that my husband is going to put many of you out of work when he turns our national parks over to big oil and other business interests.  On the bright side there will be more people with super-yachts that will need crewing #LearnToSail
7838 2018-08-25 20:49:48 Boo
7839 2018-08-25 20:49:29 Good olive oil
7840 2018-08-25 20:49:14 hahahaha
7841 2018-08-25 20:49:12 Because they’re sham artists and snake oil salesmen who don’t have any real convictions
7842 2018-08-25 20:49:12 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
7843 2018-08-25 20:49:08 Am now sad and disappointed in myself, I brought a new jumper, had it two days and I’ve already got oil paint on it which STAINS LIKE A BITCHhahahah yyyy
7844 2018-08-25 20:48:54 Bon, je viens de regarder le loooong publi sur ''Der Mond Oil & Gas WA'' (pour ne pas nommer la (les) dirigeante(s)). 

A part que ça ressemble à un publi TRÈS MAL FAIT de présentation d'un nominé aux Cauris d'Or (grand bal ma...),
7845 2018-08-25 20:48:52 I am in the “I feel horrible” adapting phase now lol. I have tons of recipes, I’ve made ground beef patties stuffed with goat cheese, cream cheese and peanut butter fat bombs, taco zucchini boats, jalapeño poppers, keto pizza, bulletproof coffee (butter + coconut oil).  fun!
7846 2018-08-25 20:48:47 Olive oil isn't really for baking friends.
7847 2018-08-25 20:48:41 Please check your facts before commenting. The average annual per capita oil consumption is 24 bbl for the US, as opposed to 4 bbl for China.
7848 2018-08-25 20:48:33 Yes, she was from the Middle-East & English wasn’t her first language....I think her family were bombed out of their home by English-speaking people who probably needed to steal oil from her country.
7849 2018-08-25 20:48:28 The Dem candidate for governor here does the same.  Paints us NRA types as the bad guys all the time.

7851 2018-08-25 20:48:24 PSA if rides break down at disneyland you will not get your money back. this would be like running your car for 16 hours at a time and wanting a refund on your last oil change when your car won’t start the next time you want to drive it thx for coming to my TED talk
7852 2018-08-25 20:48:23 What an illogical leap uou made. The reason why Nigeria is facing economic problems is because the United States lifted it sanctions from Iran. Now that Iran is able to flood the oil market, Oil buyers like India are turning to run instead of Nigeria for their oil.
7853 2018-08-25 20:47:54 Lol with animal fat (oil + butter)
7854 2018-08-25 20:47:54 U need glasses

7858 2018-08-25 20:47:10 I fully agree. There is so much complexity to cannabis and it's far more than just saying "here, take some CBD oil". Terpenes, other cannabinoids, and even method of consumption make a world of difference.
7859 2018-08-25 20:47:08 And we care about your opinion why so....?

Kinda sucks, like a Fosters Oil Can beer.  Cheers mate !
7860 2018-08-25 20:47:03 Trump Says Mexico Trade Deal May Be Near as Oil Looks Solved #bloomberg
7861 2018-08-25 20:46:46 Like seriously, if you're polite,they'll even say you're not classy or you hv ur nose in everyone's business.
7862 2018-08-25 20:46:43 Nigeria's problem isn't corruption. The people there make babies like fish, while the resources are few and dying, oil being the main stay.
7863 2018-08-25 20:46:37 You'll be amazed at the milk gelatin, oil & fat content.

7865 2018-08-25 20:46:18 so about 56.6 US oil barrels worth of diesel.
7866 2018-08-25 20:46:18 Got my oil changed/tires rotated, de cluttered my Grannie’s outdoor shed on her patio. Now me time. Relaxing at home for the rest of the night. I’m never home, so this feels nice!
7867 2018-08-25 20:46:16 One thing to clear sinuses super well during the night is a diffuser with some eucalyptus oil in it. Got one on amazon and the difference in sleep quality is amazing and partner’s snoring is reduced (so it clearly works to help us breathe better during the night!) 
7868 2018-08-25 20:46:13 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.

7873 2018-08-25 20:45:07 Bank Menatep owned Yukos Oil.. Khodorkovsky was convicted of massive fraud and sentenced to 11 years in prison but before he went to prison he transferred his shares in Bank Menatep (Yukos) to Lord Jacob Rothschild who is now a Director in Genie Energy..
7874 2018-08-25 20:45:06 they be tryna add on everything when i come get an oil change. i just want my oil changed & dats it!
7875 2018-08-25 20:45:01 Your freaking husband wants to sell off our national park land to the oil companies. When has your family ever visited a nat’l park - camped, hiked, kayaked, biked? You have no interest in preserving anything
7876 2018-08-25 20:44:48 everytime i come get a oil change they always want try to make you pay for some other shit!
7877 2018-08-25 20:44:45 We'd have been a much richer country now if your grandad's plan was accepted but the public voted to allow #Thatcher to use the North Sea Oil money to finance 30 years of unemployment instead of investing in the country. He's spinning, not turning probably.
7878 2018-08-25 20:44:37 "Fonterra and Dairy Farmers of America, and the three largest meat companies, Tyson and Cargill of the US and JBS of Brazil, have in aggregate the same greenhouse gas footprint as ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company...."
7879 2018-08-25 20:44:33 Where were u when bush and obama through innocent people in gitmo for decades without any charges??? 

Where were u when can Panama and bush bombed millions of innocent Muslims for oil and Israel?

#hypocrite
7880 2018-08-25 20:44:28 This is as meaningful and lasting as the vote to stop taking money from big oil.
7881 2018-08-25 20:44:21 Makes me want to sing FIA for you
7882 2018-08-25 20:44:18 This post makes no sense. I (and many others) hope Melvin Harris gets acquitted. I hope Chris Watts gets boiled in oil.  The pictures merely show what a Fugazzi Watts was. Standard #Dateline shit.

7893 2018-08-25 20:42:30 Some of my favorite scrambled eggs -- dice up a couple pieces of leftover pizza, throw in hot pan w olive oil. Once the cheese starts melting, throw the eggs in (I add a little greek yogurt in, too) and mix/cook. Assuming the pizza was good in the first place, this is amazing.
7894 2018-08-25 20:42:16 The prayer and the oil... its a suffering you cant imagine unless you have your hands around her throat.
7895 2018-08-25 20:42:09 Tip for retaining info: use a specific scent. Be it an essential oil, parfum, whatevs. Use it when you're in the class, and again when you take your test. Scent evokes the strongest memories, and it saved me in college.
7896 2018-08-25 20:41:54 This is strange, I think that Iraq is rich but oil Why do not you use your oil to purify your water?
7897 2018-08-25 20:41:44 It was  Olive oil that used a rope to break the bonesaw
7898 2018-08-25 20:41:43 Yes. A friend is organising some oil. She has exactly the same conditions as me, and she’s finding the cbd oil very effective.

Tin of tomatoes, 1 onion, basil, oregano, Fry onion in butter till soft add toms and herbs there's your sauce. Spread on base cook, freeze
7911 2018-08-25 20:39:40 As long as big oil, you know, the guys who killed Kennedy and staged 9/11, maintain control of the global mafia, fossil fuel will reign.

7919 2018-08-25 20:38:45 WTF is going on in this country?!
7920 2018-08-25 20:38:39 It’s a good discussion.  Most think ‘electric’ vehicles = ‘clean’.  Until the process of how the electricity is delivered to the home is explained.  Definitely less energy than oil burners but not as much as one might think.
7921 2018-08-25 20:38:35 I think the issue is focusing on it exclusively while buying oil from Saudi Arabia, vacationing in Cuba and everything you own was made in China.
7922 2018-08-25 20:38:35 To think, Edward ll could've stopped Robert the Bruce dead in his tracks by just shouting "YOUR OIL WILL RUN OUT!!"
7923 2018-08-25 20:38:31 Nah, these people would rather give our dollars to BP oil and Jeff Bezos. After all, using *our* money on us is socialism. BTW, I can only see your responses, I muted him for ignorance!

7959 2018-08-25 20:34:29 HOW TO: Turn the two corners at either the head or foot inside out. Tuck the other end's corners inside them. Then turn one of the two corners you see inside out and tuck again.Then it'll lay flat enough to fold easily.

7981 2018-08-25 20:31:06 Do you take your CBD via vaping or just the oil?
7982 2018-08-25 20:31:01 Sorry no more oil 
7983 2018-08-25 20:30:25 Obviously it was slightly unfair that that Wolves bloke handballed in their first goal then again its slightly unfair that a multi billionaire oil rich superstate decided to use the English football league as a vehicle for sociopolitical world economic domination.

7987 2018-08-25 20:29:52 I am going to drink castor oil tomorrow. I can't live like this. 
7988 2018-08-25 20:29:51 “Growing, shipping and selling food destined to be thrown away uses more energy than is currently produced by offshore oil drilling.” — Edward Humes, in Garbology (how does one underline on a smartphone keyboard?)
7989 2018-08-25 20:29:46 I was feeling a bit too brave earlier and smothered myself in oil and now my whole top half is on fire 
7990 2018-08-25 20:29:46 This I saw in him,confronted him for,engaged him factually ,baba couldn't stand it because he's allergic to criticism, booked me in the process until recent times after the twitter plague by Jack.

7993 2018-08-25 20:28:45 Coal = 19th century, Oil = 20th century, Renewables = 21st century. To get America to where we need to be would create so many more jobs than are needed now that it is laughable that it is even debated. Only the old fat cats would be harmed and who gives an f about them?
7994 2018-08-25 20:28:39 You're a politican? Barrel of oil was $100+ barrel the cost increase cause by manipulating and speculation for profiting from the dead ja dollar ..
7995 2018-08-25 20:28:28 In days gone by, we used barometers to tell us more of the environmental conditions. Now all you need is a tub of coconut oil: is it a scoop, a drip, or a chisel kind of day today?

8000 2018-08-25 20:28:11 Oil, gold, uranium - pick your poison. Withdrawing anything from the earth requires vast sums of energy.
8001 2018-08-25 20:28:10 RSO aka Rick Simpson Oil has been created and used since long before high CBD strains were developed.
It was made with whatever cannabis was on hand, if it had some CBD or none we had no idea.

Even with little to no CBD present RSO still has strong therapeutic benefits.
8002 2018-08-25 20:27:56 Golfing again?? You said you would be wayyyyyy too busy running the country to golf every weekend? Went after MY FAVORITE President Obama for golfing. Hypocrite Don The Con. Liar. Hypocrite. Adulterer. Low IQ. Snake oil Salesman. Unindicted Co-Conspirator. It all fits you.

i’ve put the cold water to close my pores but what oil/ointment to i apply now? or can i use plain shea butter?
8004 2018-08-25 20:27:47 It's usually the expensive ass ones that are oil based lol BUT they smell so damn good and are worth it 
8005 2018-08-25 20:27:37 Interesting! I see this professor also recommends canola oil as a safer alternative . Also interesting!! One man’s meat is another man’s poison ......

8010 2018-08-25 20:27:01 The extraction industry has been screwing us over for years. I'm in Weston with the oil and gas "boom."  I see mostly out of state workers doing the jobs, not locals.
8011 2018-08-25 20:26:39 The Sacraments aka a wild love affair with the God of the Universe who is somehow (!) present in ordinary human stuff: bread, wine, oil, water, hands, fire, smoke.
8012 2018-08-25 20:26:21 I am sending you the palm oil and salt you "begged" me for in jos, probably next week.
8013 2018-08-25 20:26:14 Berman was asked by industry to co-chair the pre-OSAG meetings between oil sands CEOs and ENGOs in early 2015. Industry then asked for her to be appointed co-chair of OSAG. Not CAPP, oil sands companies. That comes from Dave Collyer.
8014 2018-08-25 20:26:04 The same Parks your husband cut funding from and sold most for oil drilling?
8015 2018-08-25 20:25:47 Getting an oil change & this man keeps asking me 21 questions. I’m just tryna make sure my car lives her best life.

8017 2018-08-25 20:25:35 Cleanse with the utility bar every other day with neck shaving, beard oil on problem eczema spots, utility balm in the beard, round brush and hair dryer to lock it all in. Maybe a little styling balm and mustache wax when the situation calls for it.

8026 2018-08-25 20:23:57 Sex is cool but have u tried waxing ur legs and rubbing baby oil all over them then laying there and doing nothing but soak ur bed for hours
8027 2018-08-25 20:23:37 Venezuela has the world’s worst-performing economy among countries not at war. GDP fell by more than a third between 2013 and 2017. Inflation could pass a million per cent this year, says the IMF. The country with the world’s largest oil reserves cannot import enough food and all
8028 2018-08-25 20:22:47 You gave control to people that are not Dems. You allowed snake oil Bernie to dictate to our party.
You & @DNC  lost every cent my household put aside. 
Let Bernie get you donations. It's pathetic you sold out.
8029 2018-08-25 20:22:46 The eco with the coconut oil is the sit for natural girls with curly hair it really moisturizes and doesn’t leave the hair hard I’m so glad it tried it out
8030 2018-08-25 20:22:39 Baking soda can help?  Also getting a bottle of some essential oil and just like... leaving it open.  You know to tide you over.

8032 2018-08-25 20:22:26 Malam Audu's oil perfume :)
8033 2018-08-25 20:22:20 There is precisely zero comparison possible between first world nations and a poor nation ruled by malevolant despots that steal oil profits for themselves.
8034 2018-08-25 20:22:16 Sadly I can believe it. He’s the same jerk-off fascist working over time to de-platform ppl he disagrees with from #Twitter and #Facebook. 

He and his bald fat friend Stelter. 

These guys are not journalists. They’re all political activists.
8035 2018-08-25 20:21:59 Colts x 49ers daqui a pouco no Lucas Oil Stadium. Semana 3 da Preseason. Considerada a mais importante
8036 2018-08-25 20:21:49 AFAICT, the "Green" plan to solve climate change can be summarised like so:

1. Shut down nuclear and fossil energy and only allow "green" energy.
2. Compensate poor people suffering from the mayhem caused by step 1.
3. Pay for steps 1 and 2 by taxing Big Oil and The Rich.
8037 2018-08-25 20:21:40 Olive oil is expensive....... but you never use very much of it at once so I guess in the end I'm paying pennies for each time I use it but that still meant I had to shell out $8 for one measly bottle

8041 2018-08-25 20:21:17 baby oil or coconut oil on a q-tip will help clean up minor mistakes or just give you a more defined look on your makeup, thank youuu @_daimier
8042 2018-08-25 20:21:09 Those that voted for her think she is the way to the American dream.  Of course they fell to look at a country just south of us.  Didn’t take long for an oil rich country to fall to socialism.
8043 2018-08-25 20:21:06 hope that market prices it would have been concerned about their situation, and the Oil and Gas Activities Act. 4/4
8044 2018-08-25 20:21:05 Yep, and emerging markets bottomed in end of January. TIP etf also outperformed. Oil will follow emerging markets. Just need a bottom there and Gold could well accelerate.
8045 2018-08-25 20:20:58 Omg there’s a oil stain on my new shirt I’m crying 
8046 2018-08-25 20:20:46 I didn’t get the concealer! It was YSL. I did get my oil cleanser, a tinted moisturizer, sunscreen, and what appears to be Marc Jacobs chapstick.
8047 2018-08-25 20:20:46 Not sure either lard or oil will work when the lenses are coated?
8048 2018-08-25 20:20:25 You a letting facts get in the way of the narrative!

8052 2018-08-25 20:19:56 i mean he does come with a unlimited supply of baby oil sooooo
8053 2018-08-25 20:19:31 the rise and there be maaaad oil there 
8054 2018-08-25 20:19:28 ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING?!
Donald atrimp has DEVISTATED the National Park Service!
He gave control of EPA to big oil,
YES, hard to believe! Trump put a man who wanted EPA abolished IN CHARGE of it & opened Nat’nl parks to drilling & logging! 
Then came Scott Pruitt G-warm-denier
8055 2018-08-25 20:19:11 Our DNA says we aren't good at fish oil absorption.

8057 2018-08-25 20:18:54 Jealous. And Midnight Oil turned up too...! 
8058 2018-08-25 20:18:52 The original recipe is online.  Roast the eggplant until crispy (45 min.), let cool, peel off skin, scoop out flesh, and drain off excess liquid.  Blend w/ tahini, garlic, lemon juice ,olive oil and salt/pepper in a food processor until smoothish.
8059 2018-08-25 20:18:17 It is so simple. If folk own a car, they're destroying the planet, they know it, it's urgent they stop, but it's convenient, they actually work a day a week to get that car & then demand someone else cure them, like the oil company, the car manufacturer. Adults apparently.
8060 2018-08-25 20:18:05 I'll stick with coconut oil instead of butter. The dairy industry is horrendous.
8061 2018-08-25 20:18:04 just wanna give a big shoutout to sunscreen and almond oil for keeping my face healthy af over these past two weeks
8062 2018-08-25 20:17:05 how long does an oil change take?!?!?!?!? i been here an hour and a half already 
8063 2018-08-25 20:16:50 It’s so great we have mountains of these things sitting around not rotting and symbolizing a couple megatowns of ecological damage from oil extraction.

So so great
8064 2018-08-25 20:16:43 The recipe my family has used for years has oil and eggs and mayo. I think something about the emulsification helps with a evenly moist texture.

8084 2018-08-25 20:13:53 Like the study on mice trying to mimic a ketogenic diet. Findings was that a keto diet may lead to insulin resistance. Guesd what the mice were fed Crisco which in humans is now banned and corn oil.
8085 2018-08-25 20:13:44 @TGBrews one term oil variant left for session 4? How about you serve it inside for ticketed customers instead of letting everyone drink it all before we get here? Guess I will go back to @PRBrewing to spend my money.
8086 2018-08-25 20:13:24 Now watch while my husband sells off the oil and mineral rights to these beloved parks. Make America toxic again!

8092 2018-08-25 20:12:47 Liverpool are not an oil club nor do they have a sugar daddy. They spend their own £ b/c their hierarchy recognises that the club will become richer & more valuable if it is competitive and successful. Painful to watch. It is like seeing what Kroenke could do if he were ambitious
8093 2018-08-25 20:12:44 Can you say smoke screen? Clintons are like eels in oil. Got to take them out stealthy. She will take out half the shit with her. Shes the queen turd.

8098 2018-08-25 20:12:25 We went to Runnings this morning to buy Fresh Cab. It's a mix of herbs and oil that mice do not like. We put it in the storage area off my patio. It has a very strong scent. It's packaged well, so, normally I don't smell it. However, there was an open box in the store...
8099 2018-08-25 20:12:22 I got to get an oil change and spend th whole day and 200$ lol 
My bf goes for me takes 5 min smh men ain’t shit
8100 2018-08-25 20:12:19 Oil is dead calories and really bad for you. It turns your blood into sludge in real time. There's actually tons of research on this going back several decades
8101 2018-08-25 20:12:17 I just imagine the scent of motor oil
8102 2018-08-25 20:12:00 Dawn soap is dope bc they use it to help animals with oil on them but it's also not dope bc it's like double the price of other brands. I'm conflicted
8103 2018-08-25 20:11:47 Coconut oil saved my hair
8104 2018-08-25 20:11:43 How do you steal hoverboards from Walmart then say “oh here’s the receipt” but the receipt is for motor oil?  #challenged
8105 2018-08-25 20:11:33 Nice to see that the record heat of the 1930's is not forgotten in your graph like it seems to be in the NASA based graph that seems to be a rewrite of history to fit the climate narrative. BTW I am not on the big oil payroll.
8106 2018-08-25 20:11:06 We hand good land and adequate rain fall and yet food is expensive

8111 2018-08-25 20:10:16 @cindymccain You should try Rick Simpson oil on John. What does he have to lose. It has reduced brain tumors where they can't be seen in MRI. Worth a try. The Oil needs to only be used 4 months for reduction and or remission. Ricki lake made a doc. Weed the People.

8116 2018-08-25 20:09:47 Are usko ongc me bheja jis Khaas maksad se tha wo samjho. Varna non-practicing doctor ko oil and natural gas ke bare me kya malum?
8117 2018-08-25 20:09:40 Eh ah chi gaba da gashi 
8118 2018-08-25 20:09:38 do people really be putting coconut OIL on their skin without spf and going out in the sun? 

yknow what OIL does to flesh when heated/UV is applied? it FRYS. wow. yall be crisping up your skin and calling it skincare.
8119 2018-08-25 20:09:28 imagine getting peppermint oil in your eye and going literally blind
8120 2018-08-25 20:09:17 You're mouthed leader
8121 2018-08-25 20:09:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love herny i dream of light.
8122 2018-08-25 20:09:07 U people r so fond of middle East and arabs 

Why reason jihaad ?
Bdw golden days will be over soon as world is shifting from oil to other energy  resources.
8123 2018-08-25 20:08:52 Oil is bad and doesn't belong in a delicious, healthy salad
8124 2018-08-25 20:08:40 Most of the emissions from oil come from the end user. Broadbased carbon tax pricing pollution from all sources is good idea. Big industrial emitters and consumers need a price signal to reduce emissions.
8125 2018-08-25 20:08:32 @cindymccain My mom died of ovarian cancer a few years back. I feel your pain of John's cancer diagnosis. My mom was extremely conservative and she wouldn't try Rick Simpson CBD oil. Ricki Lake made a documentary called "Weed The People" That shows removal of brain cancer w/CBD
8126 2018-08-25 20:08:25 Well,one has to be blind not to see
8127 2018-08-25 20:08:23 گاه گاهی که دلم می گیرد
پیش خود می گویم
آنکه جانم را
سوخت
یاد می آرد از این بنده هنوز؟!
8128 2018-08-25 20:08:22 Such a shame though, for a country that has oil. Nothing seems to be forthcoming from its government about its citizens. Fair enough, the influx of people from Venezuela will have impact on housing, security and relations of concerned countries.
8129 2018-08-25 20:08:22 I guess the girl at the dealership didn’t understand why my car was done before hers & she had been there. But it’s called making an appointment because I already know everybody gets an oil change on Saturday. 
8130 2018-08-25 20:08:14 I wonder if Time Man and/or Oil Man will ever appear.
8131 2018-08-25 20:08:06 me: I hear rain *gets excited* 
raaz: that’s oil
8132 2018-08-25 20:08:05 I'm still curious about Chile

...also if Venezuela is bad because of socialism why isn't Uruguay in the same state as Venezuela when it's had an extra year of socialism and none of the advantages of vast oil resources?
8133 2018-08-25 20:07:53 Good thing you can find all this hard work with all that sweet sweet oil money.
8134 2018-08-25 20:07:32 a lil adobo/garlic and olive oil
8135 2018-08-25 20:07:25 Oil, glass, and gas may need to be cleaned up....but other than that  lol
8136 2018-08-25 20:07:20 Good old snake oil.
8137 2018-08-25 20:07:17 I agree Klopp is under pressure to win but remember,if they don't win it, it will very likely be b/c of an oil club spending billions locking them out. Truth is their rise under Klopp comes at a very unlucky time with Pep at City. Any other time and they are likely PL champions.
8138 2018-08-25 20:07:00 Taking the car for a much-delayed oil change. You can bet that if I'm forced to go out for this, there better be a good dinner afterwards.
8139 2018-08-25 20:06:54 Well since you asked so nicely  it’s an aerosol spray that you can put onto the roots of your hair to absorb oil and grease. It allows you to go longer between washes, which is great for those of us with hair that dries out if it’s washed every day.
8140 2018-08-25 20:06:28 Wanna get deleted? ....say somethin bad about coconut oil. #leaveMyOilAlone
8141 2018-08-25 20:06:27 I assume coconut water is just as bad for you as coconut oil, so I feel justified in avoiding it.
8142 2018-08-25 20:06:19 Went in for an oil change, ended up paying $160 AFTER a discount djjsjsjd
8143 2018-08-25 20:06:18 Opens new maritime routes for Russia for their oil...
8144 2018-08-25 20:06:06 Tedious for sure but big oil makes my want to die
8145 2018-08-25 20:06:05 It’s become the oil of choice in chipshops and for fried food all over the world. Slight relief that EU have finally agreed to put a stop to their devastating biofuel policy (which they were warned about). Not until it’s reaped another several years worth of deforestation tho.
8146 2018-08-25 20:06:05 I paid $60 for my oil change today I miss my civic
8147 2018-08-25 20:06:04 Change the oil in my car. Now noms!
8148 2018-08-25 20:06:02 Of course Republican presidents are racists n look at Africa as a shithole continent that's why they don't visit us. Democrats are liberals and appreciate human beings in every way; explains the visits. The invitation now is bcz of our quality oil, gas and to settle the white SAs
8149 2018-08-25 20:05:53 at the new olive oil/liqueur store in my neighborhood and the sales person is comparing some framboise to a bob dylan song and i have no idea how we got here
8150 2018-08-25 20:05:52 Don't mind them they won't always see cos we r independent here,dont belong to any gang and refused to be controlled
8151 2018-08-25 20:05:48 More to the Point.  If you don't read what you sign.  There are "fish oil salesmen" in every business.  "The only thing that matters is on this piece of paper"...  @JudgeJudy
8152 2018-08-25 20:05:47 U're welcome
8153 2018-08-25 20:05:42 I would say YUM but I hate castor oil

8155 2018-08-25 20:05:35 EU APRENDI A USAR OIL PASTEL, EU SOU A CRIANÇA MAIS FELIZ DO MUNDO
8156 2018-08-25 20:05:32 Are you using oil paint there? I've only tried it as a dot filter (once), never tried it for mud.
8157 2018-08-25 20:05:28 I don't like packaged pop corn lols. I put the corn grain with sugar and a bit of sunflower seed oil and make them all myself hhh
8158 2018-08-25 20:05:26 * Oil is Monopolized economy only by the elite

Fish is reach out to all

* Oil Pollute/ terminate life
   Fish replenish

* Oil is finite 
   Fish is infinite 

Think of #LifeAfterOil
8159 2018-08-25 20:05:13 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
8160 2018-08-25 20:05:08 This image would make a great oil painting .
8161 2018-08-25 20:05:06 Ok I have a 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid that’s a $40k car with 230,000 miles plus.  I have put $30k in just fuel alone in that car and -$12k in oil changes.  It a $82k car! The Model 3 based on wind power same miles driven will only cost $42k and $8k of electricity! $50k!
8162 2018-08-25 20:04:56 Funny...Clean Power Plan was about dragging the @GOP from their medieval thinking about power to the 21st century.

It's kind of pathetic that you guys cling to coal, a 18th century technology and oil, a 20th century technology as forever power sources.

#FutureIsHere
8163 2018-08-25 20:04:46 I tend to agree but simply raising taxes and levies and fees without addressing spending was not ideal... infact spending was increased and if it had not been for increased oil prices that strategy would have sunk us farther in debt which it has despite higher oil
8164 2018-08-25 20:04:37 Beds are burning. Midnight Oil
8165 2018-08-25 20:04:27 Its the lack of infrastructure.  Liberal policy says we work toward energy independence, yet we continue to import Saudi oil.  Why?  Ask Trudeau how else we get Alberta crude to Irving refinery w/o energy east?
8166 2018-08-25 20:04:23 I can do an oil change myself, or i can pay someone to do it for me, depends how im feeling 
8167 2018-08-25 20:04:22 Buried it lol. Good to see the team . Bet he got a rollaking. ;)
8168 2018-08-25 20:04:20 Nagode
8169 2018-08-25 20:03:46 @tinalwong @ICEContactApp no more dessert or italian cookies. The olive oil for your mother got stuck at customs. why?
8170 2018-08-25 20:03:45 what I am struggling with also but @ElemiFuentes blocked me . Can you ask her to please reinstate me, I am asking sincerely
8171 2018-08-25 20:03:37 E be like say Salah get oil ooo
8172 2018-08-25 20:03:30 Went to get an oil change and Kia said “it will be a couple hours” wtf going back to valvoline for sure
8173 2018-08-25 20:03:23 Bro he’s going down, CAnt wait for the curb your meme on Logan oil
8174 2018-08-25 20:03:15 Even though it says it’s for “dry skin” my skin is oily and all the moisture helps my skin not produce so much oil. I use their moisturizing cream in a tub all over wet face/neck/body. I used to have toners and serums but that’s really all just fluff.
8175 2018-08-25 20:03:14 Day 3 of this sinus headache/ migraine hybrid. If I’m not at work, I’m sleep in bed w/ peppermint oil on my face, an ice pack on my head and under my neck, and a heating pad on my stomach. My prescription strength migraine meds are barely working. Over the counter meds don’t work
8176 2018-08-25 20:03:09 You mean, that very same Venezuela that the US embargoed its oil and whose CIA is active in its destruction.
8177 2018-08-25 20:03:04 We have caught you red handed
Always looking dope btw
8178 2018-08-25 20:02:32 Donny Dementia has developed a plan to make sure consumers & the environment lose while big oil companies & Trump rake the money.
8179 2018-08-25 20:02:07 Gochujang paste + sesame oil most likely give that distinct flavor 
8180 2018-08-25 20:01:57 Try dial *929*10# and see if u're eligible
8181 2018-08-25 20:01:53 Lol its worth it at d end
8182 2018-08-25 20:01:52 Do you have your own Gold Coal Diamonds Copper oil platinum ?
8183 2018-08-25 20:01:48 The USA doesn’t even make the top ten oil producer (OPEC) maybe the biggest Canadian Oil exporter with the Dakota XL pipeline
8184 2018-08-25 20:01:47 See you can talk from now till tomorrow deep inside, you know grand pa is going bk to kastina state or better still he can continue his medical vacation abroad with our oil money he's been stealing.

8186 2018-08-25 20:01:36 Ethiopian government already planned all these changes happening in the Somali region to effectively utilize the newly found oil deposits...pple must be at peace then u can easily suck Honey from their land.  Ethiopia smart nation.
8187 2018-08-25 20:01:21 #Colts-49ers in 30 min here at Lucas Oil.

Starter jobs earned tonight at a few spots:

> RT: Howard, Smith, Haeg, now Good get a shot
> DE: Simon, Hunt, Basham competing. (Simon has edge)
> CB: Moore, Desir are starters (Wilson?)
> WR4: Kasen Williams' job to lose, in my opinion
8188 2018-08-25 20:01:14 Worse than LARD!?!?!?  In a country where folks have Doritos and Mountain Dew for breakfast, it's all relative...
"Extra virgin" coconut oil is NOT the worst food. More highly processed types are bad saturated fats. Olive oil is the better choice for cooking.
8189 2018-08-25 20:01:07 صح يا بتاع التاريخ .  بديت تكبر بعيني
8190 2018-08-25 20:01:07 Ma crème fabriquer par mes soins LIIIT, l’hydrolat de citron LIIIT, tee tree oil LIIIIT ( comment j’ai pu vivre sans vraiment )

8192 2018-08-25 20:00:55 Cite your sources — and no, oil industry experts and papers are Not credible.
8193 2018-08-25 20:00:50 Lol Rt n pass,must u talk
8194 2018-08-25 20:00:37 Its you softie youngsters who don’t know they’re born  Part of the world too where everyone could survive without electricity for days if needed : candles, lamps, oil fired cookers, oodles of wood to burn - all ready for the inevitable power cuts from weather or strikes
8195 2018-08-25 20:00:32 I fry and make Mayo with rapeseed oil. it is very low in saturated fat.
8196 2018-08-25 20:00:26 I’m nauseous so Brandon is rubbing peppermint oil on my feet

8200 2018-08-25 20:00:18 Ah, ok. I've rediscovered my love of butter. Olive oil, garlic red pepper equally lovely. Angel hair can work but it's so delicate...but yeah, better bet is linguine.
8201 2018-08-25 20:00:11 Can someone please oil that door?  LOL 
8202 2018-08-25 20:00:07 Is selling you snake oil. It's bullshit. Malema himself admitted eff policy will result in massive poverty and suffering in SA. The problem is that he is twisting the trough. He claims there will be poverty because of dark forces within the IMF and the west who wish to punish
8203 2018-08-25 19:59:53 اسحبه .. كله الا الاسكندر العظيم
8204 2018-08-25 19:59:46 Great...did u remember the oil?? 
8205 2018-08-25 19:59:38 Power the Future is a climate denying movement backed by the Kich brothers. Their goal is more coal and oil. Read their manifesto
8206 2018-08-25 19:59:37 I got the baby oil ready
8207 2018-08-25 19:59:37 Me and you both, bud.
8208 2018-08-25 19:59:34 Though I’m non-interventionist, I’d never suggest McCain’s motive (esp given his history) is oil. You’re only proving my point. Just bc someone disagrees w you doesn’t make them evil. Honest ppl can disagree about how to achieve the same result (peace, prosperity, healthcare etc)
8209 2018-08-25 19:59:23 Some Kirkland brand olive oil
8210 2018-08-25 19:59:22 Indeed. Russia cant fund all these occupations and wars if oil at 30.
8211 2018-08-25 19:59:21 Superdelegates are a bad thing. Tom Perez removed superdelegates recently. He also started taking oil money recently.Thoughts?
8212 2018-08-25 19:59:13 Headed to Lucas Oil Speedway!! We are planning on bringing the car up to the midway before the races. Come on out, sit in the car and sign the front!
8213 2018-08-25 19:59:13 Love how optimistic oil analysts are on the global economy.  A downturn in 2019 will drop Brent to $75/barrel.   Currently, it's at $75/barrel
8214 2018-08-25 19:59:10 Plant therapy makes fantastic products!!!  I have a ton of their essential oil’s
8215 2018-08-25 19:59:01 Bruh, it hurt like hell.
Surprised that it didn't do more damage since it was hot oil.
My hands are my smash tools, I would fukin die if I couldn't use em.
8216 2018-08-25 19:58:57 โหยแต่ปีนี้รีวิวหลุมเหี้ยมากไม่ลงอ่ะดีละ
8217 2018-08-25 19:58:50 لا تخليني اسحب شكري
8218 2018-08-25 19:58:47 That's good. I don't oil mine regularly. I shower daily but yes reduce your frequency for shampooing them if you can manage that. Based on where I am & how much they're exposed to dust, pollution and heat, I try to alter my shampooing routine. I avoid conditioners, a bottle/year.
8219 2018-08-25 19:58:46 Organic Coconut Oil, it´s a good thing, but it should be much more produced, that is the problem...!!!!!
8220 2018-08-25 19:58:40 Het heeeeele huis ruikt naar Suriname!! Pine oil! Ik had een flesje meegenomen. Hiiiiirlijk!
8221 2018-08-25 19:58:35 شكراً اخي الليدر معاز
8222 2018-08-25 19:58:31 The last thing to be cooked today has gone into the oven. A variation on cucumber & mint cupcakes by Kate over at @veggie_desserts.
No butter, just olive oil, spelt flour not self raising, and eggies from my best friend's chooks! I hope they work.
8223 2018-08-25 19:58:19 I don’t like the saudis we should have taken over their country,oil & ports
8224 2018-08-25 19:58:16 I just read we are going to be the biggest oil exporter in a couple years. Maybe if the US kept more of there own oil.
8225 2018-08-25 19:58:08 it is SAUDI LED COALITION = Saudi not "OEU LED coalition" 
and BTW, when someone targeting buses full of children, weddings, funerals etc, damn right I will take sides. 
It's a shame that Saudi $ and oil making the rest of the world to look away
8226 2018-08-25 19:58:05 ทำไมกูไม่ลงหลุม
8227 2018-08-25 19:58:05 This may work on your corporate oil friends and dark money PACs but not on the Texans you've sold to the highest donor. You don't represent red or blue, you represent everything wrong with politicians. #BetoForSenate #complicit #CountryOverParty
8228 2018-08-25 19:57:58 Took me 8 mins to choose my chocolate last night as I was determined to buy some without palm oil. I didn’t know dairy milk had palm oil in, has Mackies as none wof their bars contain palm oil. Think before you buy, our desires shouldn’t come before animals lives! #PalmOilkills
8229 2018-08-25 19:57:47 i love olive oil but yea it feels way more thick than coconut, something about the coco + coffee too 
8230 2018-08-25 19:57:39 Just got two brand new tires and an oil change for 61 dollars  pays to have a brother who works at a tire shop n the fact his manager loves me 
8231 2018-08-25 19:57:24 Venezuela's economy failed because they only produced one thing. Oil. They didn't grow their own food, or make anything else. That's not socialism.
8232 2018-08-25 19:57:24 It’s funny how many men come to bradzoil in there big trucks all macho but can’t change their own oil 
8233 2018-08-25 19:57:24 I don't like the butter. I'm trying with olive oil. I think I used the wrong pasta, too (angel hair). Gotta go with the liguine and more garlic/red pepper up front.
8234 2018-08-25 19:57:08 حرام عليك يا فتى
8235 2018-08-25 19:57:06 Petty little tyrant. He'll never be anything but a snake oil salesman with 5 deferments. Pathetic....he's not a .0001th of the man McCain is.
8236 2018-08-25 19:57:03 Woo, first oil change in the WRX at a bit over 3,000 miles.

Old oil and filter looked good, no signs of concern. Awesome!

I still hate the whole crush washer BS, but at least I know for sure the 16mm crush washers I have do fit and work fine

I should get a torque wrench tho...
8237 2018-08-25 19:57:02 Big oil!!!!
8238 2018-08-25 19:56:50 เออออ คิดเหมือนกันนนน

8241 2018-08-25 19:56:24 1. Wash with a soap,
 2. Apply a toner and let it dry,
 3. Skincare cream. 
4. At night repeat 1&2 then apply serum. You can suptitude cream and serum with a Skincare Oil if needed. 
5. Mask 2or3x a week.
8242 2018-08-25 19:56:23 See I’ve been using olive oil, that just be why I wasn’t getting good results! Thank you!
8243 2018-08-25 19:56:20 This is to stop coconut oil marketing been done by patanjali and the huge profit that india is Making out it
8244 2018-08-25 19:56:01 Ergoooooooooo, they shitcanned it.

Instead of admitting they made a major fuck up kneejerk reaction, they enabled several HUNDRED people to lose their jobs all because some snake oil salesman took things out of context.

There is no winnner here on any side.
8245 2018-08-25 19:56:01 Hey @timplaysguitar remember that time you rode in the bed of Sams truck all the way home from Atlanta and it took 3x as long as it should’ve because we had the flu and a leaky oil tank?
8246 2018-08-25 19:56:00 we can make Space Force but can’t invest in education, keep sos sec from being insolvent in 20yrs, get off big oil and retool for renewable energies, can soend three times more than anyone on defense but can’t fix crumbling infrastructure..

8252 2018-08-25 19:54:37 Just think HowU & all other GOP in Congress and @SecretaryZinke are destroying all of them. Giving land 2 big corps. Oil,Mining, lumber, plus others. Stealing lands from Indians native Alaskans, by time u all get done murdering sleeping animals and there babies nothing be left
8253 2018-08-25 19:54:31 Cruz knows that he never sounds genuine when he debates and the people of TX will spot that right off.  He is another snake oil salesman!
8254 2018-08-25 19:54:24 Centre...let's kill 00000s people in wars for oil and power and say it's for humanitarian reasons and that we're spreading democracy.
8255 2018-08-25 19:54:21 Well... what a way to end my week on a shitty note
I wanna thank my bitch ass family member for selling me that amazing car and not telling me that the engine is ass and will probably burn your oil quicker
8256 2018-08-25 19:54:17 親にSAN値を0にされて死んでるんだけど、今日バイトなんだよな…

ぶっちゃけ休んでSAN値回復に務めたいけど、GPSで場所バレるから、バイト休んだことを追求されるんだよなぁ…
8257 2018-08-25 19:54:07 i almost just bought that but then i was like well...... i don’t really need another oil.... i thought the ingredients were really interesting though so you should give it a go

8259 2018-08-25 19:53:55 I think we should organise somewhat randomised acts of defiance. Several pockets of "refusal to pay brideprices" "refusal to pay movie tickets, Uber trips and co" "Refusal to help fix bulbs, change generator oil, do phone settings and co"
8260 2018-08-25 19:53:41 I'm absolutely loving the cleansing oil from @ActivistSkin - it fits all of your criteria and I use it daily to remove makeup!! 
8261 2018-08-25 19:53:36 Not quite sure why more Leftist energy is currently going into critiquing a capitalist enterprise producing electric cars and grid batteries than capitalist enterprises producing diesel cars or mining for oil or making bombs.
8262 2018-08-25 19:53:12 Whole flax seeds contain both the fiber + oil, giving you all the nutritional value in one. Add 2 Tbsp ground flax seed to a Green Smoothie!
8263 2018-08-25 19:52:51 You can follow some of her tips without spending much like eliminating dairy, refined flour & sugar; replace the fats by healthy fats like olive oil, nuts & try to exercise intensely for an hour at least 4x a week
8264 2018-08-25 19:52:45 He needs a Serious Oil Change
8265 2018-08-25 19:52:43 I love shallots too. Dressing must be a little lemon juice*fresh* and olive oil. Yumm
8266 2018-08-25 19:52:42 Staaahhpp I can't deal she can't be serious! Coconut oil and almond butter in the same day! 
8267 2018-08-25 19:52:36 Stay away from hair products, I avoid completely, rarely even use the hairdryer on heat more. Oil them for a little while before you intend to take a shower. Keep your clean but keep a watch on the amount of shampoo/conditioner you use, excessive chemical exposure is detrimental.
8268 2018-08-25 19:52:20 It’s astounding how many climate deniers are still out there. The oil industry has actually convinced you that there is still doubt. Why? Because Doubt equals no public action and they get to continue to rape our lands and pocket books. Wake up folks... before it’s too late!!
8269 2018-08-25 19:52:16 Just filled up my seringue with tweed oil like it l was penicillin
8270 2018-08-25 19:52:03 Boiling in oil.
8271 2018-08-25 19:51:59 Secret Is Tea Tree Oil I Went Thru The Same. Face Super Sore Weird Bumps But Tea Tree Oil Cleared It All Up
8272 2018-08-25 19:51:57 I belief dat oil cums from ded foreign folks. More ded forrin folks=more oil innit bruv! My beliefs is valid, right?
8273 2018-08-25 19:51:54 Will’s fully embracing his Dad persona today. He’s outside changing my oil, grilling food, drinking beer... all while his shirt is tucked into his shorts. All he needs now is a pair of goofy white sneakers.
8274 2018-08-25 19:51:53 Tariffs of solar panels, steel, aluminum and everything else hasn't helped the market. Threatening war with Iran and N Korea was great for oil prices
8275 2018-08-25 19:51:51 Oh I know that. I just don't get it there is enough oil here.
8276 2018-08-25 19:51:50 He has absolutely no self awareness. His lips move but he says nothing - well, nothing believable. Hot air and utter bullshit. I wish he'd just fark off and then when he gets there fark off a little further and takes his snake oil mates with him.
8277 2018-08-25 19:51:44 If I’ve ever recommended you Sunday Riley’s Juno oil, they just lowered the price to $36 as opposed to like $50 something dollars  to all my ladies with dry skin, this is a holy grail product!!!!!!!
8278 2018-08-25 19:51:42 Omg I did a DIY hair mask with Curl conditioner, avocado, and olive oil ... my hair is SILK
8279 2018-08-25 19:51:38 I am marinating 2 TBones with rosemary garlic, salt pepper in a balsamic vinegar and olive oil mixture. Putting them on the grill tonight. Also pasta con pesto and a nice salata with shrimp
8280 2018-08-25 19:51:33 To imply that zucker doesn't have his balls in a jar on his desk is dangerous.

8284 2018-08-25 19:50:43 PDP ran 30 states bankrupt when oil sold as high as $120 - $150/ pb.
PMB bailed them out when oil sold as low as $28pb

Are u are still asking for what PMB has done?

If U can't hear,U can see,if u can't see,u can feel,if u can't with any,U are as DISHONEST as PDP.

8286 2018-08-25 19:49:40 @AyahAlfawaris 
Do renewable energies create more jobs than oli ?
Since Oil is capital intensive
8287 2018-08-25 19:49:34 Unfortunately it won’t Obama and Trump lied during their primaries that you will get out of Iraq! About Venezuela the CIA wants to replace the president with someone like an ‘Oil trade friendly Augusto Pinochet’ it is never about peace and democracy
8288 2018-08-25 19:49:17 So now Knoxville's Tavern, formerly Oil City Roadhouse, is called Anthem?

8290 2018-08-25 19:49:06 Fuel should not be more than  1 usd/liter.  Those trucks hauling oil from Turkana to Mombasa is a shame. The first facility should have been a refinary facility.  The ripple effect is, Kenyans will revert to small cars like Suzuki Alto hence consuming less fuel.
8291 2018-08-25 19:48:49 Oh please the manly hype of oil rig work is such bullshit.
8292 2018-08-25 19:48:19 Countries like yours killed Gadaffi because He wanted you guys to buy our minerals and oil and food with gold not paper that is valueless to us.
8293 2018-08-25 19:48:12 Oh? Are you using that damn #science again? Pretty sure the #CorruptGOP has labeled anything that prevents coal/oil jobs as #fakenews. #ozone is just #LiberalHypocrisy, right #MAGA?  #USA
8294 2018-08-25 19:48:09 I know all about that, gawd bless the free markets allowing them to profit off cheaper oil than we can give them. I’d love it if people would stop saying “Trudeau keeps importing Saudi Oil” when it’s trade agreements and such by the right that have enabled this.
8295 2018-08-25 19:48:05 waking up at 7am on Saturday for a oil change 
8296 2018-08-25 19:47:56 2/get off his rich fat duff and meet with slightly different constituents, not just other wealthy oil & cattle folk. I really hope Greg can give him a run for the $$. He knows his stuff.

8298 2018-08-25 19:47:51 To avoid the bad effects of Sade Sati is by worship him on Saturday. Offer food to poor, needy, labour and dog.

8299 2018-08-25 19:47:51 mederma, bio oil, and cocoa butter blend
8300 2018-08-25 19:47:51 Quite poetic this. It needs to be reproduced in oil. As a painting - nothing kinky.

Happy Onam to you
8302 2018-08-25 19:47:31 So here’s what I need to know:  can I just mix a little of this into my body oil for just a hint hint of sparkle?  Does it blend well with other mediums?

8310 2018-08-25 19:46:41 With the growing world population, the increasing growth in China, India, and developing countries, the demand on oil is increasing not decreasing. As long as Renewable alternatives much more expensive, demand on oil will increase. U want US pple to pay energy bill for the world.
8311 2018-08-25 19:46:21 did a big girl thing and got an oil change
8312 2018-08-25 19:46:06 Debt is the new oil.
8313 2018-08-25 19:45:58 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8314 2018-08-25 19:45:49 This mischaracterize AB’s land rights system, whereby rights are sold or leased in layers. Most farmers own (freehold) surface rights to plow depth. The Province (“crown”) owns subsurface rights and leases these rights to oil & gas companies to explore & produce (leasehold).

8317 2018-08-25 19:45:13 If it’s made with agave or  coconut syrup it’s ok it doesn’t have any sugar in it. In fact make it with coconut oil and it will melt that wobbly tum away any way
8318 2018-08-25 19:45:09 That's basically what I did except no chilli because I'm allergic. And LOTS of sesame oil
8319 2018-08-25 19:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8320 2018-08-25 19:45:02 I'm a vegetarian, so forgive me. Isn't that just an oil gland for preening feathers?
8321 2018-08-25 19:45:02 Oga salam I need ur help on how to do it.
8322 2018-08-25 19:44:50 listen i know it's sweat or oil but it looks good tbh
8323 2018-08-25 19:44:47 Cool, let’s move stock car racing bad to SR#11 from Johnson City, TN to Asheville, NC where it started anyway! Or Daytona, at the Beach!
8324 2018-08-25 19:44:41 Beau is truly the best and surprised me with an appointment for a couples massage at my favorite place today  

that being said, I can’t stop thinking about them getting the oil in my hair when I’m having a great hair day

8326 2018-08-25 19:44:38 Must you be abusive to proof your point? Did your so called past leaders provided even 5000k jobs even when they enjoy the highest oil boom price.

I’m sorry.  I must have missed your tweet expressing outrage against Christopher Watts.

Then stuffed them in oil barrels for days.  

Still waiting..........

8342 2018-08-25 19:40:53 Hmmm. Perhaps a legacy of Doctors endorsing Cigarette ads and oil companies adding lead to gasoline for decades had an erosive effect on scientific legitimacy. But yeah let's blame the skeptical undereducated, cause it's obviously not systemic abuse of the Public Trust. Classist.

8348 2018-08-25 19:39:46 Yeah, it is, indirectly, low-key. CBN is still artificially influencing the market by churning out hundreds of millions of dollars to operators. Then there's the rising oil prices due to the supply cut from OPEC and American shale oil

8352 2018-08-25 19:39:22 That is why I'm looking for another option. Coconut oil is my choice, but finding the right one is a pain in the ...
8353 2018-08-25 19:39:18 Me, buying groceries before the supermarket closes up for the weekend: eggs, vegetables, fancy olive oil.
An average German person buying groceries: frozen pizza, beer, cigarettes, one onion.
8354 2018-08-25 19:38:36 Btw guys Argan oil is a blessing
8355 2018-08-25 19:38:15 Olive oil isn’t very suitable for frying because it smokes up at high temperatures. Old school corn chips and the like used to be made with refined coconut oil.
8356 2018-08-25 19:38:12 The Italian Chopped Salad from @McAlistersDeli with oil & balsamic vinegar is amazing. Wow.
8357 2018-08-25 19:38:08 We trade them all their former residents for what? Mexican oil?
8358 2018-08-25 19:38:07 Don’t try to pluck them off yourself  if you do apply something with oil in it. And rub them off
8359 2018-08-25 19:37:53 I use this oil free neutrogena face wash, then I moisturize my face with cetaphil lotion and use this acne cream on my pimples (Benzoyl Peroxide 5%, had to get it prescribed by a doctor) and I cut cow milk out of my diet I only drink almond milk now.
8360 2018-08-25 19:37:47 I hear even on CNN how the economy is going so well,but not for working poor,gas,oil,food, insurance,meds all much higher prices then 2 yrs ago. The rich are getting richer but the poor are getting much poorer or is it only me.
8361 2018-08-25 19:37:27 Olive oil isn't a seed oil tho.
Do you store it at room temp or in the fridge?
8362 2018-08-25 19:37:17 What type of hair oil did he use ? May i know ? In process to keep a long hair like him but tak rajin pakai conditioners & etc
8363 2018-08-25 19:37:10 Yeah whatever works for you then. My dad like to cook corn tortillas in a little bit of oil and the sprinkle some parmesan on them so I know it at least taste good.
8364 2018-08-25 19:37:08 Two reasons why we lose interest in sex. One, the lack of exercise (strength training and cardio for at least 45 min 3-4 days a week) and two, the lack of taking vitamins (fish oil pills, cinnamon pills, garlic pills, etc) to keep us healthy.
8365 2018-08-25 19:36:55 I just saw one that said liquid coconut oil, but it didn't say organic whereas the solid ones said organic.
8366 2018-08-25 19:36:30 + any tighter (Clark wishes) they just might squeak. Now I'm all for driving fast and living on the edge, but come on... /NOT/ when you've just waxed the seats and got them so slippery it's as if baby oil has been applied.

8372 2018-08-25 19:35:33 I was lying on a bottle of coconut oil I never had. 
8373 2018-08-25 19:35:30 I respect you very much Sen Bruce but please stop making PMB any more important. If you have to tweet about him, it's time to ask him how much NNPC yields especially with increase in crude oil prices. No one knows how much Nigeria makes a month in crude oil sales.
8374 2018-08-25 19:35:24 just 7 of us
8375 2018-08-25 19:35:23 Now he’s gonna have to wipe the oil off his wallet because he doesn’t know photography 
8376 2018-08-25 19:35:18 You draining your oil out of your car and driving it after too?
8377 2018-08-25 19:35:14 When something really shocking happens my mom gives us a spoonful of salt and olive oil.
8378 2018-08-25 19:35:00 I could not care less if we use AB oil in the east. 
1) I want to phase out oil
2) in meantime you want the world price? Forget it.

8384 2018-08-25 19:34:09 That oil funna take me under
8385 2018-08-25 19:33:55 I buy normal refined coconut oil (solid at room temp). This is the stuff people used to use back in the day for frying before seed oils.
8386 2018-08-25 19:33:43 True. Now what say ye of your origin? Hebrew BIAFRA,ongoing GENOCIDE by British Govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. AMALGAMATED by British govt and their jihadists 1914 to 2014 to steal oil in Nigeria. REFERENDUM stops the GENOCIDE of Jews and Christians in Nigeria.
8387 2018-08-25 19:33:38 I think he meant it sincerely, that's my impression, avenging his father. Chenney wanted it for oil. But Bush was that naive (& incompetent). There was a state dept plan on what to do after a Saddam take out. Bush refused to use it. I got that directly from congress aids involved
8388 2018-08-25 19:33:29 Then TESTIFY! OH, and by the way.....You ARE already involved! You're in so deep you'll need one of your buddies oil drills to dig you out!
8389 2018-08-25 19:33:26 Mine have always had cod liver oil almost every day if they aren't having fish in the food
8390 2018-08-25 19:33:19 I hope so, but even before oil there was so much violence in ME

8394 2018-08-25 19:32:55 Bah, you think the fell dragon would be felled by mere oil? Go on then.
8395 2018-08-25 19:32:53 I know there are some forms of coconut oil that have been processed to be essentially purely MCT oil, and those will be in liquid form. They’re usually labeled MCT oil but can also be labeled “liquid coconut oil.”
8396 2018-08-25 19:32:46 Idk why anyone would use a regular razor in 2018 and still complain about itching and razor bumps/burns when electric razors are out there.?? Also does anyone not know that tea tree oil needs to be applied on after shaving? Damn take care of yourselves.
8397 2018-08-25 19:32:43 Energy in Depth (EID) is a pro-oil-and-gas drilling industry front group formed by the American Petroleum Institute, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) and dozens of additional industry organizations
8398 2018-08-25 19:32:28 Just an idea but, is it possible to create a weather changing mod to these custom maps? Every map can be played in day or night, rain or shine.      Playing frost fire while a typhoon was about to hit the oil rig! While the rounds progressed, the rains, winds, would intensify!
8399 2018-08-25 19:32:27 Its all the more shocking when you realise Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.

8405 2018-08-25 19:31:18 The question is irrelevant because a deal brokered between a trade block consisting 28 diverse economies can never be appropriate for a single nation. It's not rocket science. Or are we going to start producing olive oil & importing stuff we have a surplus of?
8406 2018-08-25 19:30:53 A definitive ranking: 1) Chopt, 2) Just Salad, 3) a hardy bowl of the grass from my backyard with some olive oil drizzled over it, 4) sweetgreen
8407 2018-08-25 19:30:49 I wanna start oil painting
8408 2018-08-25 19:30:48 That's interesting - the culture's brutality reflects back into how the religion is evaluated. There's a theory that was dictatorships are ended & oil domination of economies, the people will go back to trade & businesses that interact w/the world. That will shift culture to less
8409 2018-08-25 19:30:45 We use mustard in our homemade pickles. Also, want to try mustard oil in my girls hair for stronger, healthier hair and give it a growth boost.
8410 2018-08-25 19:30:20 in cooking method, we don't use so much oil & garlic, in Egypt the garlic is overly fried with strong taste with much oil, the rice also, we use the Indian  rice "Basmaty"
8411 2018-08-25 19:30:10 Oil in Holan Heights. Trump knows this as does @pritipatel ... hence Tory boost for Israel & anti-Corbyn smears. Never let the truth get in the way of another oil war!

This dynasts are not reached that position by neither by ground experience are qualification. They never had taught life living with hostile people. So no harm.they expect only oil money. For thst they sell there soul and country too.
8417 2018-08-25 19:28:48 Dropped my car off at Pep Boys to get an oil change and a alignment. They call me back saying I need hella shit and it’s gonna cost me almost $500  I think not. Thankfully Brandons a mechanic. Jesus fuck.
8418 2018-08-25 19:28:25 What she said. My mum's did. Sge said its mad important to oil it while pregnant too. Loads of Shea butter or cocoa butter mixed with natural oils
8419 2018-08-25 19:28:19 A Harvard professor says coconut oil is poison;  if you can't trust Harvard, whom can you trust?
8420 2018-08-25 19:28:19 Too bad your husband wants to destroy the national parks to drill for coal and oil.
8421 2018-08-25 19:28:11 I think it says a lot about my 8yo that one of his most prized possessions right now is his aromatherapy diffuser (lemongrass oil only plz) and he just referred to a Shirley Temple beverage as "a monstrosity". 
8422 2018-08-25 19:28:06 i don't hate it, & it's definitely fun to experiment w/ oil blends, but there are a ton of people out there who do the same, & would be a ton of effort to even break even doing it.

8438 2018-08-25 19:25:48 Yeah it’s not too bad. Won’t taste like someone’s grandma’s of course, but I use flour, baking powder, salt, vegetable oil, warm water, cornmeal + knead attachment for KitchenAid mixer. Then finish by hand and use a saucepan lid to cut them round.

8448 2018-08-25 19:23:47 Those of us in West Africa eat raw palm oil everyday and in our meals and we still survive to ripe old age. Coconut is eaten daily with boiled or roasted corn or other nuts like bread fruit. No harm, which coconut is Harvard referring to?

8454 2018-08-25 19:23:05 All coconut oil is in a solid state below 74 degrees Fahrenheit, because like butter it is mostly saturated. In my experience virgin coconut oil definitely imparts a coconut flavor, at least when I used it for eggs or spinach.

8460 2018-08-25 19:22:01 I hate how every time I get an oil change the workers try to convince me to get a bunch of shit I didn’t ask for. It’s a new car MOTHERFUCKER there’s nothing wrong with it
8461 2018-08-25 19:21:39 yes, however the International community fails those who remain in war zones. The USA and Russia intervene when oil resources need protection, so why not do for people?? This is the point.
8462 2018-08-25 19:21:33 you are spouting crap again...there is no fracking.
8463 2018-08-25 19:21:30 Ke nyoko eo dawg get some castor oil bra you know weed causes bile
8464 2018-08-25 19:21:28 I prefer to remove it because that’s where the fat is. Like you’ll notice the difference in the amount of oil in the stock when you steam it skinless vs with the skin.
8465 2018-08-25 19:21:25 Great to see all the carbon tax supporters piling on. How about this for a policy: we sell more oil to China to burn in their power plants rather than coal thereby reducing 'their' GHG by 50%.

8470 2018-08-25 19:20:43 I had the 2001 zetec s.. in red, i loved it.. valve stems leaked so badly you never needed to do an oil change as it burned about 1l a week!
8471 2018-08-25 19:20:42 No, che had cold pressed virgin. Cold pressed seemed to mean that it wasn't in oil form. It was in a hardened state. Is yours in oil form or in a solid state? 
Virgin coconut oil wouldn't make everything taste like coconut, would it? I can't see it making say steak taste like it.

8482 2018-08-25 19:18:58 It's also a big deal being a trillion dollars in debt.

The profits from our oil and other resources leaves the country at worst, or is concentrated in the hands of ultra rich Canadians at best. Those resources are OURS. We should all be profiting from them.

8487 2018-08-25 19:18:06 There are likely a lot of factors worth considering.

E.g. Venezuela isn't self-sufficient & 98% of exports is state-owned oil. 70% of the economy is "privately owned", albeit currency control, price control, can't fire employees, hyperinflation, astronomical min wages, etc.

8532 2018-08-25 19:10:05 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
8533 2018-08-25 19:10:04 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
8534 2018-08-25 19:09:53 Who owns the oil? Not the people of Texas I suppose
8535 2018-08-25 19:09:35 I live in a very red oil & gas county in TX, and have seen more and more BETO yard signs in the last couple weeks.
8536 2018-08-25 19:09:32 What about sunflower oil?
8537 2018-08-25 19:09:32 And connecting more dots... Russian access to Atlantic without dodging Baltic and Turkey, Russian oil exploration in Arctic, Russian effort to destroy carbon emission controls, Russian effort to raise oil prices and reduce supply from other nations...
8538 2018-08-25 19:09:30 Mussed the "protect other countries".

Just odd that those countries just happen to have large mineral and/or oil reserves.
8539 2018-08-25 19:09:24 Beard oil is amazing
8540 2018-08-25 19:09:12 I need to get new hair oil or use a new conditioner/co wash? Where ma curly headed fucks at....¿
8541 2018-08-25 19:09:09 People that think it is fun or funny to tickle other human beings should be poured with hot oil. 
8542 2018-08-25 19:09:07 This is to let you know these companies that you're talking about like Koch brothers Etc the cool mines and the oil fields asked me to claim it I do not know why is that from kidnapping in in Flint Michigan and being held for ransom 389 million or the attempt several times on my
8543 2018-08-25 19:09:05 No oil or arms sales ?
8544 2018-08-25 19:09:02 use olive oil instead of shaving cream lovely! works absolute wonders or is it a razor problem?
8545 2018-08-25 19:08:57 I didn’t even finish the products I purchased. Gave the soap and oil/serum away. The body butter went to my helper. It’s not for me :(
8546 2018-08-25 19:08:53 Plus it’s paid off so who gives a Fuck Gas it , put oil in it , drive it to work.
8547 2018-08-25 19:08:50 Deep cleaning the whole house with coconut oil in my hair and a face mask on and I seriously feel like my whole life is together 
8548 2018-08-25 19:08:46 At least HE didn't drown the woman after he used her, like the other Kennedy.
8549 2018-08-25 19:08:43 How many times do you have to be told that she was brought to the table at the request of the oil and gas industry? 
How many times do you have to be reminded she has not been on that committee since 2017?
STOP LYING ALREADY!

8550 2018-08-25 19:07:51 A very full and exciting week for the team. Monday we are at Avon. Jv plays at 5:30 w/ varsity to follow. Wednesday conference game at home against Greenwood. Varsity plays at 5:30 w/ JV half to follow. Saturday we are at Lucas oil against Danville @11am
8551 2018-08-25 19:07:21 We try to table things and know the fats and oil in the situation
8552 2018-08-25 19:07:09 Dear mr. President Donald Trump Commander in Chief of the United States of America if you want clean water in our country stop the fracking for oil they drill down 10,000 feet then 10,000 feet out then they pump xylene and hydrochloric acid under pressure to Frack the shale
8553 2018-08-25 19:06:53 You defo don’t look 49 mate !!! Oil of Olay?!
8554 2018-08-25 19:06:50 Who can fix a oil leak in Audi A4 ? Need it fixed before it’s shipped Texas
8555 2018-08-25 19:06:47 It’s always fun wasting a Saturday morning on vehicle maintenance. Oil change on progress, smog check done, now just to empty my bank account paying for registration.
8556 2018-08-25 19:06:32 I agree with you. Yes, it's a little too extreme. However, we need to reduce the consumption of palm oil.
8557 2018-08-25 19:06:24 Ya intinya sih lagi mencoba buat "Bobo amat", tapi ga enak yah :D ga aku banget.
8558 2018-08-25 19:06:12 Makes much more sense! I just bought new wool balls and the oil I want to us so I was going by the sales person’s directions. Yours is easier and less wasteful. Thanks!
8559 2018-08-25 19:05:43 My Jeep has been leaking oil and it turns out while I was on vacation my dad & brother took both quarts of oil out of my Jeep and didn't put them back so now I'm sitting at an abandoned gas station after work waiting for someone to come get me cause my Jeep doesn't have oil

Fun!
8560 2018-08-25 19:05:41 When I get my oil changed and they are like “yeah and it’s recommended that you get your tires rotated or your will die” and I’m like nah I’m good and they are like ok no worries.

8562 2018-08-25 19:05:36 No if you have a loved one with diabetes find someone else to get information from, because @LillyDiabetes oil will hold it against their grandchildren one day.
8563 2018-08-25 19:05:11 Just got to the press box at Lucas Oil. Tonight will likely be significantly less exciting than New Pal football was yesterday, but we should get a nice long look at the Colts starters finally. @GDRsports
8564 2018-08-25 19:05:10 Kinda wanna just sit down and redo the choji oil on my katana because fuck it i can but also my katana is 300 miles away
8565 2018-08-25 19:04:54 All mate, at the moment heavily involved in cladding oil and gas gear. Inconel
8566 2018-08-25 19:04:46 Is coconut oil a good moisturizer for my scalp? I’m bald and looking for other options lol.
8567 2018-08-25 19:04:41 Yep.  No traces of Junior and crew, just a few pieces of wreckage and an oil slick.  Sad.
8568 2018-08-25 19:04:35 Poor sweet Maggie.  I also highly recommend pet CBD oil
8569 2018-08-25 19:04:27 I see our promise
8570 2018-08-25 19:04:04 They care deeply and risk their safety for the common good; anyone with kids aught to care also
8571 2018-08-25 19:04:03 Okay, but be careful not to get hit by hot oil.
8572 2018-08-25 19:03:50 I think the NGOs would disagree with you. Palm oil is by far the most efficient oil crop. Any alternative would be vastly more damaging. We need to hope for a synthetic alternative, and in the meantime try to eat less processed foods. It doesn’t look good.
8573 2018-08-25 19:03:49 this body oil really just does something for me.
8574 2018-08-25 19:03:42 I'm up
8575 2018-08-25 19:03:14 Get oil in your lamps  now. Get back to Jesus. Get out of your sins. Time to wake up. I don't care who believes me or not. You can't stop God. U keep listening to false ones telling u all will be well, how the US will be healed and how great it will be.
8576 2018-08-25 19:02:53 Your husband want to destroy those parks with mining, oil drilling and deforestation. Deal with him don’t thank people.
8577 2018-08-25 19:02:38 I did an argon oil mask
8578 2018-08-25 19:02:35 Mine, too. And they weren’t of the planter class. Poor farmers, as were most.
8579 2018-08-25 19:02:29 @pronounced_ing Here's some happy news for you. Got my oil changed yesterday and the woman at the desk was reading Little Fires. Really liking it. The indie oil place lets her order books on their Amazon acct. as a perk!
8580 2018-08-25 19:02:20 You listened to the fools, took in everything they said. I don't presume nothing. I know God can't lie. You better all be ready for him. He will come in the blink of an eye. You don't wanna be like the 5 foolish virgins who had no oil in their lamps.
8581 2018-08-25 19:02:20 @bbc606 what’s that constant squeaking man it’s doing my head in. It was the same last week. One of you needs a drop of oil
8582 2018-08-25 19:02:15 Oil
8583 2018-08-25 19:02:08 No they were there to stop fracking - a very worthy cause in my opinion; with the planet heating up fossil fuels use must be halted as soon as possible
8584 2018-08-25 19:02:03 Go in for an oil change. Left with a new truck
8585 2018-08-25 19:01:52 Just ate a soup made of  breast, ,  broth,  cream and oil, , onion and sesame seeds. Delicious. 1100 kcal, 110g of protein. This way I just need 2 meals a day#keto

8597 2018-08-25 18:59:42 when Kelly and I were younger we would tan on her back porch with VEGTABLE OIL and then say “it smells like french fries out here” Nah shit sis, we out here COOKING.. literally
8598 2018-08-25 18:59:26 ...Kinda, although you put that a little weirdly, and I don't. All that's needed is to sprinkle a bit of water into the oil.

8601 2018-08-25 18:59:07 And it’s often very straightforward - much easier to change the oil than change the engine.
8602 2018-08-25 18:59:00 Wish *i* could get a full synthetic oil change
8603 2018-08-25 18:58:56 I recommend CBD/THC oil, flower or edibles. Transcendental meditation is amazing. Aromatherapy candles such as lavender mint ylang ylang can help a lot - as can teas such as chamomile and/or lavender.
Hope you feel better soon and get to a less anxious place soon! Anxiety sucks!
8604 2018-08-25 18:58:53 When your ding ding friend decided to put oil in a pan, turn it on high and walk away to continue to iron his clothes... Completely forgetting about it until the smoke alarms are going crazy and he walks out to a black cloud in his living room. 
8605 2018-08-25 18:58:45 Hold on. Y’all EATING coconut oil???? On purpose???
8606 2018-08-25 18:58:33 If you’re on the list, you’re against regime-change wars & leaving countries in a worse state than we found them, all in the name of “democracy” (i.e. stealing oil & supporting the military industrial complex & petrodollar). I wonder what the writer’s motivations are....
8607 2018-08-25 18:58:29 ...and eventually erect ugly statues to massage that stupidity.  It suggest the education system has been mediocre at best.  Ppl should be able to spot snake oil when it's being spun.
8608 2018-08-25 18:58:28 My dreams are always weird, maybe castor oil will help 
8609 2018-08-25 18:58:23 One of the key issues of the relationship of Russia and Ukraine is about transit. Pipelines through Ukraine for natural gas and oil. Crimea was always Russia's access to Black Sea - i.e. warm water ports. This and Ukraine's role as a breadbasket shaped Russian history/geopolitics
8610 2018-08-25 18:58:22 How fr with all the oil...
8611 2018-08-25 18:58:11 “What you need to know about CBD oil” starting soon. 

PS- you don’t get high. It’s not drugs. It’s not illegal. 

What it is- pain relief, mental stability, restful sleep.
8612 2018-08-25 18:57:52 Orang bahagia juga.
8613 2018-08-25 18:57:46 green tea oil?
8614 2018-08-25 18:57:41 I always feel bad when I get oil changes, the mechanics always gotta go into my weed smelling ass car
8615 2018-08-25 18:57:33 Getting gas for my truck literally feels like getting blended oil change every week

8623 2018-08-25 18:56:52 Beard oil, like perfume, should be applied conservatively for best results. A dime-sized amount is ideal.

8627 2018-08-25 18:56:29 I’m adulting in that I got an oil change, new brake pads and new tires when I was supposed to (so before I had to call AAA) but I’m still tight when he told me how much it would be. Adulting is a whole acam
8628 2018-08-25 18:56:21 I cracked open a set of Trader Joe’s “Tea Tree Tingle” shampoo/conditioner/body wash with peppermint, tea oil and eucalyptus botanicals this morning.
It felt like I was showering with a giant, effective, and nice-smelling Halls cough drop! 
8629 2018-08-25 18:56:19 Probably on that oil tonight

8632 2018-08-25 18:56:08 Man that's messed up !!!! Very uncomfortable to watch but very necessary... that guy needs stuffing in the oil drums he allegedly put his family in & Mr Harris seemingly acted out the primal urge to protect his family.. shocking biased reporting
8633 2018-08-25 18:55:57 Hey! Watch you don't offend any mad bikers who weald chains, ride oil dripping British bikes and bite of heads
8634 2018-08-25 18:55:44 & Mexico needs to get its shit together. There is no excuse that their citizens' QOL is lower than Canada or the US, esp after NAFTA. They have a huge amount of arable land, beautiful land that attracts tourism, a lot of oil, miles of coastline for ports for 2 major trade oceans.
8635 2018-08-25 18:55:21 So is oil, GM, Ford, ... Steel manufacturing. Many industries rely on subsidies. Tesla is the best shot to overtake German auto manufacturers.
8636 2018-08-25 18:55:19 Bullshit! The only reason the trump administration isn’t embracing solar and wind power, is that there are no lobbyists to grease their palms with bribes like coal and oil lobbyists!
8637 2018-08-25 18:55:01 Look up ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas in Nigeria. TRUTH is SUPREME.
8638 2018-08-25 18:54:53 The Oil would be pretty deadly with EK65.
8639 2018-08-25 18:54:15 It's amazing how high on life I am after getting a free oil change today.
8640 2018-08-25 18:54:03 You can still buy snake oil because there is always a demand and people willing to sell it.
8641 2018-08-25 18:53:52 へー？
8642 2018-08-25 18:53:43 prisons, toxic waste dumping, fracking, drilling for oil, banks all ok in your back yard but not porn....lol
8643 2018-08-25 18:53:33 While Saudi Arabia treats people like animals and shuns Canada Canada buys billions of dollars of oil from them. You need to get out more and learn the reality of oil my dear.
8644 2018-08-25 18:53:28 We no longer need their oil. Other forces at work in ME, namely coalition against Iran.
8645 2018-08-25 18:53:18 I agree.Let see the same support against ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas.Nigeria has expired, AMALGAMATED1914 to 2014 to steal oil and gas.REFERENDUM solves the GENOCIDE. TRUTH is SUPREME. SPEAK.

8647 2018-08-25 18:52:55 -exfoliating is key, so exfoliate before & after shaving
-DIY exfoliant, just mix coconut oil, brown sugar & himalayansalt together the coconut oil will soften your skin
-use a men's razor for a closer shave 
-always put lotion/baby oil after shaving to get smooth legs
8648 2018-08-25 18:52:42 FYI “Bakers’ Flour” = bread flour, salad oil = safflower or canola or veggie oil

8650 2018-08-25 18:52:27 Exactly and same goes for personal stock investments within oil, fuel, mining, logging, chemicals, etc - it's an investment in contributing to destroying our planet. There ARE phenomenal options, humans
8651 2018-08-25 18:52:25 Dropped out of college so I might be wrong but isn’t oil hydrophobic? Therefor isn’t it the opposite of hydrating your skin? Idk it feels good to the touch but I still FEEL dry whenever I use it.
8652 2018-08-25 18:52:25 [Perks of working with fire in a fantasy setting: None. They miss their stove.
But at least they got to retrieve their trusty frying pan during the all too meta maintenance.]

Okay, so first I'm going to heat some oil. Do you know the trick on how to determine it's hot enough?
8653 2018-08-25 18:52:10 Sure i guess if you discount all the capitalist wars for oil and shit, turning a good few perfectly functional nations into what we call third world today. And all the people in for profit prisons for selling a harmless drug that's legal in a lot of states.
8654 2018-08-25 18:52:10 I have used coconut oil happily since 2012, I can talk for an hour why I think it's a better oil than others and about 77 ways to use it. But it's just another oil, just quantitatively different from other fats and oils. It's indeed pseudoscience to present it as God or Devil.
8655 2018-08-25 18:52:09 8- all of my SMOK products are an oil slick color it’s so PRETTY!
8656 2018-08-25 18:51:45 The elephant is an animal they actively don't care if they kill as long as their big game hunters are happy. Their logo should be a can of oil.
8657 2018-08-25 18:51:44 Duncan Hunter's wife was also behind the Exxon Valdez oil spill and that Three-Mile Island thing.  Terrible woman.  Just horrid.

8663 2018-08-25 18:50:55 I think you are lacking some engine oil in your brain.  How do u say such a thing? Google & read all the bibles in the world.
8664 2018-08-25 18:50:32 Yesterday I did what y’all should’ve did the last time and found that y’all put in too much oil. I shouldn’t have to tell y’all what y’all did wrong y’all should’ve figured that shit out when I brought it back!
8665 2018-08-25 18:50:31 Conventions aren't. Some individuals are and their squawking the loudest. Squeaky wheels getting the most oil and all that.
8666 2018-08-25 18:50:14 The best solution is don't buy palm oil or any product that contain palm oil. That's the best way to drive palm oil plantations out of business.
8667 2018-08-25 18:50:09 Maybe at one time the office of the president truly ran the country. But the President hasn’t truly run the country for a while. The money does. Oil, banks, weapons, “trust funds.” The president has become a figurehead. No one can do anything about it really, it is what it is.

8672 2018-08-25 18:49:14 Hands off the reserve bank, its oil run machine that we are proud of its sovereignty and independence
8673 2018-08-25 18:49:10 And what about all the polyeurothane that is produced from by products of oil. Construction and infrastructure uses billions of products that are produced from oil and not enough alternative methods exist yet to remove it from process.  Including snow and rain gear........
8674 2018-08-25 18:49:08 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
8675 2018-08-25 18:49:06 Yeah! Now let’s get busy selling it all off to oil and gas!
8676 2018-08-25 18:48:53 You'd better hurry because new gas and oil wells and pipelines are being developed daily all over our planet.
8677 2018-08-25 18:48:51 Hey, If I order for delivery will the oil be bulk shipped to the US and back to the UK or sent directly from source, thanks.
8678 2018-08-25 18:48:51 Setelah adem lalu ilang tanpa kabar lalu lupa
8679 2018-08-25 18:48:48 Uhm... Might be Ashland oil...... Which would be even bigger...
8680 2018-08-25 18:48:45 Humor is subjective, and I find it funny. And it happens that the things we "disagree" on include sending troops to kill a bunch of people for oil wars
8681 2018-08-25 18:48:37 -slow & steady wins thoes have, don't go all fast, you will cut yourself & go over other hairs,
-when shaving your  do it sideways, it's better 
-skin the shaving cream &replace it with coconut oil/baby oil/conditioner your legs are going to be smooth AF
8682 2018-08-25 18:48:32 @Valvoline DON’T DO IT. MY CAR BLEW UP 20 minutes AFTER Having an oil change/engine cleaning. Then they gave me the run around and since I couldn’t afford a lawyer they dismissed me as if I was invisible. All they had to do was pay me what my car was worth, 5 grand! Never heard.
8683 2018-08-25 18:48:21 King Salmon season the Monterey Bay about 15 years ago. People were giving it away. Not too good lately. I never get tired of it. I season with crushed garlic, a little olive oil and capers. Then I cook it a foil tent to well done.
8684 2018-08-25 18:48:09 Please tell your husband to stop signing executive orders without bothering to read them. Especially the ones that allow oil exploration, drilling and fracking on protected national land and the ones that lift regulations protecting endangered species. Can you do that for America
8685 2018-08-25 18:48:06 This one girl told me she hadn't changed her oil in years; checked the dip stick and it was muck
8686 2018-08-25 18:48:05 Peppermint oil is a blessing from above 
8687 2018-08-25 18:48:03 Next thing you will tell me oil  which Syria ain’t got any
8688 2018-08-25 18:47:48 Venezuela was fine until the global crisis, oil prices dropped, they're currency was back by that commodity. Then the new prez came in and he's almost as country currency fluent as Trump  I am fed up w/ ppl who believe cutting taxes and blaiming the poor is the solution
8689 2018-08-25 18:47:46 Hmm, if you can source 98%... why not the full 100%? Because it's actually in a lot of your food. I paid nearly twice the price tonight for the only wraps on the shelf without palm oil (and without an ingredient list bigger than the actual wraps).
8690 2018-08-25 18:47:36 Hahaha  where did you read this?
8691 2018-08-25 18:47:32 Simple... peel the plátano, boil it, mash it, add some olive oil y sal. Tada Lmfaoo
8692 2018-08-25 18:47:28 We will have oil next weekend plenty of it !
8693 2018-08-25 18:47:22 I am for TRUTH. Who speaks for Hebrew Biafra ongoing GENOCIDE by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. Nigeria has expired 1914 to 2014. We are silent Becuase of British Govt. TRUTH is SUPREME.
8694 2018-08-25 18:47:17 Ga kok neng, ga panas ini Aja lagi kipas2 biar adem, terus adem, adem terus :D
8695 2018-08-25 18:47:13 Yes, we did all rebuke them for that. PUK Could have pushed more, but they were silenced with fat oil money. Corruption and tribalism is killing nationalism and Kurdistan in Bashur!!
8696 2018-08-25 18:47:11 i have oily comb. skin and my skin literally changed so quick after i stopped using oil-free products, started using korean skin care products, and focused on changing my diet. we get oily bc our skin is dehydrated and the skin is over compensating, putting oil on really helps!!
8697 2018-08-25 18:47:06 We lit my nigga! Oil on deck
8698 2018-08-25 18:47:04 I bought a 'relaxing' essential oil blend for my diffuser last night to help me sleep. It smells like someone distilled my grandmother into liquid form. I had nightmares because my grandmother was a nightmare. The oil went into the trash and I performed an exorcism on my diffuser
8699 2018-08-25 18:46:59 I usually try to be a patient person but when my oil has been getting changed for an hour I start to get annoyed 
8700 2018-08-25 18:46:58 Exactly what happened in Venezuela! The capitalist left and took the electricity with them. And toilet paper. And food. And any basic need. And the production of the oil fields. The benefit of socialism, everyone loses weight except the leaders. Call it the “Socialist Diet”.
8701 2018-08-25 18:46:55 I worked in clinical research; this is one of the things that frustrated me the most. Almost as much as the Mail and Express saying everything causes or cures cancer. 
In trials cannabis oil has been shown to have very specific effects for specific diseases. Its not a cure all.
8702 2018-08-25 18:46:06 This creature has overeaten the palm oil + very poor education. Is not even capable of conspiring properly.
8703 2018-08-25 18:45:47 That reminds me, I need an oil change.
8704 2018-08-25 18:45:37 “Is your oil you cook the wings in cross contaminated with eggs?” No but it is cross contaminated with ligma

8710 2018-08-25 18:44:55 Thanks! This was done with oil and occasionally I’ll sell originals but mostly prints
8711 2018-08-25 18:44:42 Since January 2017 the Trump White House has sanctioned 217 Russian-related individuals and entities, including oil company Surgutneftegaz and power company EuroSibEnergo. Targets include heads of major state-owned banks and energy firms, and some of President Putin’s closest .."
8712 2018-08-25 18:44:40 We are used to this. Likely it will self correct in a day. This happens in cycles - someone shares messages like this,  people hoard yopera oil zvese nemari.  Next load comes:  normalcy. Hoarders sell on street. People can't afford hoarding:  we don't have the money for it tbh.

You opened the door for major issues.
How do we stop a Trump like person from getting on our ticket?
Shame on you for folding to someone who is NOT in our party.

8735 2018-08-25 18:40:51 I stopped outdoor early morning exercise because of some police and oil bunkerers early morning dealings in my area. The last time i went jogging, i was in the middle of it when i heard sporadic gun shots btw police & bunkerers over payments disagreement

8752 2018-08-25 18:39:19 No past sins. There is ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas.Nigeria has expired. AMALGAMATED by British govt and their jihadists 1914 to 2014 for oil. REFERENDUM SOLVES THE GENOCIDE.TRUTH ACROSS THE BOARD.

8759 2018-08-25 18:38:27 My issues; 

1) you should never promote something we do not have true understanding of (i.e. coconut oil MCTs)

2) you should never promote the ketogenic diet aside from very specific cases (i.e. epilepsy)

3) The words "may be beneficial" when the evidence suggests otherwise
8760 2018-08-25 18:38:26 I just did a hot oil treatment (pre-poo), washed, conditioned and detangled, deep conditioned, and styled my hair. I see why a lot of y’all going bald.

1. Let’s ignore the snake oil salesman  
2. Let’s go on with the inauguration 
3. This court will be fun to see how it assumes such a case, as the case can only be heard by a properly constituted court of Zimbabwe  or so I think 
8769 2018-08-25 18:36:52 But who was plane? WHO WAS PLANE?  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

8794 2018-08-25 18:33:07 Pretty sure we've spoken about cannabis on here before... you've really got to do a little more research before tweeting from the hip. Medicinal benefits of cannabis are very wide-ranging, and there's absolutely no reason why cannabis oil can't have had a significant impact.

8802 2018-08-25 18:31:48 “Poison” is overstating it. But people do tend to go overboard with food fads (açaí, coconut oil, olive oil etc) No one food is a miracle worker.
8803 2018-08-25 18:31:35 I’ve told ppl I get coconut oil from the beauty supply store (I also get it from the supermarket) and they’re like “they sell food at the beauty supply store?” Sis...it can go in your hair...
8804 2018-08-25 18:31:25 A crook(hustler) like Obama and his administration would not be mad because in truth they did steal all the money they could from the world which was there #1 objective-How they can not be held accountable is easy to c.

8814 2018-08-25 18:29:30 Ummm..... Izzy, usangofarira kuvharwa nema politicians. They are not in this for you and me. But for themselves. The evidence is there. NC has his copies of v11. He knows he lost but he wants to use vanhu bedzi. Look deeper below the layer of snake oil that politicians sell you.
8815 2018-08-25 18:29:24 Idc how much lotion/oil they put on my feet, I still walk out the nail shop with ashy feet watered down ass shit
8816 2018-08-25 18:29:13 Lol she means when you consume it. As if the billions of people in Asia who have been consuming it for centuries are suddenly dying of coconut oil poison.
8817 2018-08-25 18:29:02 We have heard about such fraudulent american discoveries and we should ignore them. There is every possibility that some multinational drug company is behind this,trying to launch some product replacing coconut oil and water.

8819 2018-08-25 18:28:51 That? What do- Oh.

[Grima is curious about their cooking... That puts a smile on Jannis's face.]

Go ahead! You can come closer, too. It just might get a bit, uh. Hot and splashy once I stir fry the meat and veggies in oil.
8820 2018-08-25 18:28:49 Disappointed earlier today when in @Tesco that all their wraps on sale had palm oil & disgusted they sell a corn wrap didn’t even have majority corn flour base ... didn’t even have 30% let alone 50% or 75% corn flour base. P take!
8821 2018-08-25 18:28:45 Bauchi is beautiful in the end. Really hot. But I made the best friends out there. There was one Alhaji that had chuncks of Kilishi and buckets of Dambun Nama anytime I visited, he still gives them to me to this day (FOR FREE) from my childhood days oh.
Good people!!
8822 2018-08-25 18:28:35 Best body scrub i have ever tried(organic):One portion of honey (usually i buy it in the market from farmers),one portion of rice flour,one portion of sugar,any base oil (i use olive oil),and some drops of fav essential oil,mix it well. And you'll thank me for the baby skin
8823 2018-08-25 18:28:21 We using #Coconut oil for centuries. Nobody ever died of Coconut Oil consumption for centuries

8826 2018-08-25 18:28:01 Every % oil counts towards the profitability of #osr. InV1030 is hard to beat on oil and was a star performer in farmscale trial with @McGregorFarms again this year. Extra oil = extra £ in the bonus. Available from @GFPagriculture and  @FrontierAg and can be drilled into Sept
8827 2018-08-25 18:27:59 The entire middle east is literally built for them! That's their home! Why the hell these people wanna settle down in countries who's best practices, ideologies and way of living is exactly opposite them!! Why not just live in your god damn oil producing Arab countries!  Sick..
8828 2018-08-25 18:27:47 I knew how to change brakes and do an oil change myself at like 14 or 15yrs old. The real question is will I do it now? Absolutely fucking not! Unless I’m broke broke

8830 2018-08-25 18:27:40 there is no logical reason for Venezuela to be in this state of poverty. they have oil reserves - gold mines  and are situated on the Caribbean ocean, the sun filled playground of tourists ...  criminal leadership stealing money and ruining the economy is my guess
8831 2018-08-25 18:27:37 @AldiUSA you guys should think about adding avocado oil to the oils you carry in store next to olive and coconut.
8832 2018-08-25 18:27:34 cant believe i’m applying the smelly medicated oil for tummy ache. rip nose 
8833 2018-08-25 18:27:32 Absolutely agree. Research doesn't support coconut oil as being a safer version of saturated fat. I know people who switched to coconut oil as their main cooking oil thinking it is a healthy alternative when it actually contains more saturated fat % wise than butter,beef and lard
8834 2018-08-25 18:27:31 Help me wish Glorious Happy birthday to an awesome friend and a woman of God who has become a great gate of blessings to me.Naa O Nortey ! Bless u buddy!
8835 2018-08-25 18:27:15 Also... niggers are really out here drinking oil and thinking it’s healthy because you put the word coconut in front of it
8836 2018-08-25 18:27:08 Guys who are cheating in lsk must be pros cause this town is too small for such bullshit  just witnessed a nigga hide under his car nd said the car was leaking oil in the morning to the girl he was with while hiding from another one. 
8837 2018-08-25 18:26:27 Seems like when I need a oil change I all my gas run out faster 
8838 2018-08-25 18:26:25 Everytime you go in for an oil change they wanna tell you 50-11 things that’s wrong with your car

8840 2018-08-25 18:25:51 They must've felt like they were boiling in oil when rte news couldn't find a single person on the streets with anything negative to say!  
8841 2018-08-25 18:25:34 You are a confused person. The tweet was why oil being exported at less than the retail price in our country. I replied to that, now when you don't have an answer you change the goal post. How convenient.
8842 2018-08-25 18:25:18 So is the guy changing my oil judging the amount of half empty water bottles on the floor of my backseat or nah?
8843 2018-08-25 18:25:16 I would literally give ANYTHING except Connor to make this happen. Even Leon. Karlsson is not only a Norris Dman but could replace Leon's offence. Scary.

najib has proved that he is brilliant when he overcome the oil crisis(dat time oil price slammed..2013-14 if im not mistaken)..he worked very well.
I hope u judge with justice later
8848 2018-08-25 18:23:46 @TheGlossers which oil would you recommend for oily skin with red marks around nose and chin?

8850 2018-08-25 18:23:28 Body shop has a B.B. cream, shade 00 is very fair, not sure about oil control but if you don’t like it you can take it back. And there’s a 35% off code for this weekend?
8851 2018-08-25 18:23:22 Unfortunate response. So Banks and Oil companies shouldn't ask for NYSC since it doesn't help anyone. You're calling all those who served, are serving and will ever serve fools.
8852 2018-08-25 18:23:17 The last fucking weekend I'm gonna be burning midnight oil. Next week I'll be burning all my revision notes instead.

8854 2018-08-25 18:22:42 I made an appointment over the phone to get my oil changed without my dad’s help and I only cried for 20 minutes
8855 2018-08-25 18:22:36 Khekhekhe I am so tired it is so hot I have Laundry and also I just saw how I left my kitchen unattended before I left and also I have unpacked bags and I have run out of tea tree oil I need chai but also I need to cry a leetle bit
8856 2018-08-25 18:22:16 My granny was so traumatised by having to put to her dog down that she never got another. She did end up with a cat 30-something years later tho, when my uncle rescued a kitten who'd been put in a water-filled oil drum with his siblings & his mother (only said kitten survived).
8857 2018-08-25 18:22:10 Iiiiiii am such a dumb jerk, I ordered my CBD oil a week later than I shoulda so I'll be doing without for that long. Dammit. It definitely gets more effective with continued use, so I hope this doesn't set me back.

8864 2018-08-25 18:21:32 Now I remember why I disliked my great-grandmother so much. Castor oil and burnt fingers are still vivid memories and the fits she threw when I got good food and maybe even a cookie... outlandish. The woman lived way past 100, mostly out of spite I guess.
8865 2018-08-25 18:21:25 If oil price drops, that HURTS Russia, correct?  I'm in agreement with the tweet, but would love explanation or clarity on the oil price comment...not being hostile or argumentative

8869 2018-08-25 18:20:44 It is horrendous what happened to Mollie at the hands of an illegal. We have a Legal, White man who murdered his 2 little girls and pregnant wife. Hiding them in an oil silo then lying about it. No wall will change the fact that there are evil people in this world.
8870 2018-08-25 18:20:26 Why my 2011 X5 burns 1 quart of oil per month. Please let me know!!

8887 2018-08-25 18:18:51 He has 3 burn dots but the shock of the hot oil hitting him was awful to see! I found oil dots on his t-shirt as well. He got lucky! What about the next child @Benihana
8888 2018-08-25 18:18:49 @JimbSwim I’m watching all these people getting “triggered” at the car dealership while I’m getting my oil changed. They’re showing @FoxNews
8889 2018-08-25 18:18:42 I’m in a little town in Utah right now and gas is $3.38 a gallon!  Trump is making sure big oil gets its share.  Wages here can’t be very good either.  It likely takes more than two hours work to buy a gallon of gas.
8890 2018-08-25 18:18:37  A “damn wall” would have stopped that Colorado white guy that killed his wife & kids & put them in oil tanks? nope
8891 2018-08-25 18:18:08 I only work with acrylic. Oil paint takes way too long to dry and I'm an impatient man. Also acrylics are typically a lot cheaper and easier to blend imo

Please get your facts, you're spreading fake news and this is just stupid and worthless, your fake news destroyed Iraq because your country was after their oil and now you forget the injustice of oppression, now that black people are doing things for themselves

8897 2018-08-25 18:16:36 Please don't forget to inform him that prices of foodstuffs in the market are at the highest level. For instance, as at today;

1. A tuber of yam = 1,200 naira
2. A bottle of palm oil= 400 
3. 3 litres of groundnut oil=2,800
4. A cup of rice = 110
5. 3 cups of garri = 100
Etc.

8910 2018-08-25 18:14:05 Always be honest with clients about piercings. Never sale "snake oil" cures to them. You are not a doctor first off second off there is no proven evidence that it works 3 off if it did again we are not doctors.

8920 2018-08-25 18:12:53 I usually do, but it stopped using lots of oil, so I got complacent, then it started again. Only 70k on it. So now I'm using the motorcycle and the weather is perfect and the world is good again.

8941 2018-08-25 18:09:59 Maybe in the short term. But in long term would have saved environment, stopped pollution related illness, and advanced oil/coal free technologies.

8948 2018-08-25 18:09:32 Bout to reschedule my oil change this weather not for me
8949 2018-08-25 18:09:32 America is already in need of it and an essential oil scrub to get the stench off

8953 2018-08-25 18:09:10 Batteries like wind turbines manufactured products no oil = no batteries 50 million flights now will double by 2040 China building 150 new airports Norway emits diddly squat Co2 like UK at 1.2% pissing in the ocean would make more sense Charge batteries with what exactly??
8954 2018-08-25 18:09:03 The psychedelic vegan underground persists. LSD is periodically spiked into teh reservoirs by the oil drum-full. Their emit§time is t e everpresentnow™.
8955 2018-08-25 18:09:00 Probably lol i don’t have a singing voice but i smoke. Try vaping with the cannaBis oil its better
8956 2018-08-25 18:08:52 Except that in the UK, traditionally an openly-wooded grassland habitat, cattle don't need to deforest anything, whereas crops do.  So the comparison would be better with palm oil producers and UK crop producers.
8957 2018-08-25 18:08:50 I use different mediums, from pen to paints, I Acrylics(heritage brand), oil paints to coffee

8964 2018-08-25 18:08:18 Due to our massive increased demand for vegetable oil, yes. We now eat about as much veg oil as we do beef, and we consume much much more as biofuels.

-Exfoliate ya skin + USE SPF goddamit!! Not coconut oil!! Sunscreen!!

-If you have time, put a bentonite/ activate charcoal mask under your armpits. It removes heavy metals + toxins! No one wants to smell ya, you feel me?

-Drink plenty wata!

Enjoy.
8985 2018-08-25 18:05:10 The question isn't so much about producing oil or environmantal campaigning, it's how you do it afterwards and whether you respect what you've learned and held true to the agreements you've reached.

9024 2018-08-25 18:00:13 Typical. Read one sentence and don't bother thinking beyond.

By the way, Venezuela is a socialist hell-hole of their own creation. They built their entire system on government control of oil and when the bottom fell out, they couldn't support their greed or their people.

9033 2018-08-25 17:59:14 Or put olive oil on his glasses cleaning cloth
9034 2018-08-25 17:59:11 but take away the oil revenue and as a livestock crop it starts to look a lot less appealing....and of course those within the industry disagree - they need to maintain a captured market for their waste product or their pockets will get hurt.
9035 2018-08-25 17:59:10 What about using the bioré and using an oil/moisturizer after?

9103 2018-08-25 17:50:08 Based on the placement, it seems that the palm oil cut & burn is at the epicenter.

9105 2018-08-25 17:50:03 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
9106 2018-08-25 17:50:01 Just think of all that saved closet space for ammo. No racks of shoes and never-worn dresses.
9107 2018-08-25 17:49:59 作者が今連載してる「不滅のあなたへ」も面白いよ！
9108 2018-08-25 17:49:41 Let’s be honest here, a good sales men isn’t honest fully but trump is more of snake oil salesmen in my eyes, or say skinny wraps pyramid scheme type of energy lol
9109 2018-08-25 17:49:36 No you're not. You're focused on helping corporate interests. You're focused on breaking promises on oil pipelines, on electoral reform, on improving conditions for FN. You're basically moderate CPC.
9110 2018-08-25 17:49:34 Not a self-styled leftist. 
The issue driving the crisis in Syria and Yemen is the severe water shortage. Russia, like Saudi Arabia and Iran has all his financial eggs in the oil industry.
Oil and water don't mix.

9113 2018-08-25 17:49:19 Describing oil as a technology is like calling a potato cuisine. It’s what the chef does that matters.
9114 2018-08-25 17:49:00 Can you change the oil, while you are under there Dexter 
9115 2018-08-25 17:48:28 อ่อ อิแอคนี้เหรอ นี่เคยบอกให้นางลบเรื่องสปีชอี้ชิงที่พูดว่าอี้ชิงด่า นางก็บอกเหมือนกันว่า 'แซวเล่น' เฉยๆ
9116 2018-08-25 17:48:26 Definitely had Gun Oil in my carry on once and as the female agent looked at it, I’m not sure which of us was more surprised as I blurted far louder than necessary “It’s for gay sex!”
9117 2018-08-25 17:48:24 Got an oil change at the shop today... came back with needing new tires breaks etc like  fallback 
Ain’t nobody ask y’all to check anything but the oil
9118 2018-08-25 17:48:22 That was the best shower ever I love my peppermint oil soap
9119 2018-08-25 17:48:20 All those boats are in getting supplies for the oil rigs
9120 2018-08-25 17:48:20 my mom ran around the house screaming “i know one of you girls stole my hair oil”.. two minutes later she goes back into her bathroom & i hear her quietly say “oh it was behind the soap the whole time”
9121 2018-08-25 17:48:06 I've been using the @beautybakerie wake and bake oil as a moisturizer and a primer and I haven't had any new breakouts even while wearing their makeup all day which I canNOT do with my skin! That stuff is a facesaver! Lol
9122 2018-08-25 17:48:06 High octane and an oil change? My car runs fucking GREAT.
9123 2018-08-25 17:47:52 Oil companies face some pressure to clean up their act, but they could use some more carrots and sticks. This works better, though, when the ENGOs are ready to also recognize real gains and focus their ire on the holdouts rather than the industry at large.
9124 2018-08-25 17:47:49 I took my car to get an oil change and now it’s overheating wtf
9125 2018-08-25 17:47:43 Maybe they do. Just googled and first result says they seat engine oil. 
9126 2018-08-25 17:47:35 Chef Ramses cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Play-Doh.
9127 2018-08-25 17:47:29 So now I just gotta get my brakes done and another oil change but at least my car isn’t overheating anymore
9128 2018-08-25 17:47:09 It's nothing to do with drainage. It's a new track surface, it's very dark due  the amount of bitumen on the top of the surface, heavy rain brings the oil to the surface. Older grey tracks don't have this issue. MotoGP insisted on the new surface
9129 2018-08-25 17:47:08 Mechamaru's blood(/oil) was blue

Since K1-B0 is fed by electricity, what colour is his blood? Blue too?
9130 2018-08-25 17:46:53 but only 2 packets of 2 t oil was filled. On specifically asking for the price of 2t oil, the attendant pretended to have missed on 2t oils part and made good the balance amount after raising concern. During peak hours it's not possible to go through details of 2t oil.2/3

9133 2018-08-25 17:46:33 It looked like you were having fun the whole time. And nice plug for the Amazon pasta bowl :-)
Actually the video/audio was great, I thought. (Orientation is a minor thing). The sound when you put the potatoes in the oil 
Food looked awesome, as well
9134 2018-08-25 17:46:28 Full plant is always what will work the best. But not everyone can use THC where they are at. The next best step is full spectrum hemp oil, which has the cannabis medicinal value with no intoxicating effects. Though many people have also found success in pure CBD.
9135 2018-08-25 17:46:23 You are aware that CH4 has a GHG potential of 86x CO2 over the 20 year period? And on that basis CH4 increases now add approx another 60ppm CO2 equivalent of warming?

Further, oil production has increased 40% since the Rio Climate Summit in 1992, not decreased?
9136 2018-08-25 17:46:22 Check your Engine oil today.
9137 2018-08-25 17:46:22 Ok, lets.
What do you mean entitlement?
You don't think every American deserves affordable healthcare?
Surely you mispoke.
It doesn't matter who gives more to environment and charities.
Trump gave away public lands to be destroyed by oil & gas co.'s.
Globalization is coming.

9139 2018-08-25 17:45:54 More than 60 years.

The Koch family made a fortune selling gas & oil to Hitler AND Stalin.
More than one member was heavily involved in Nazi ideology.

It's no surprise their family is still promoting the same values through every possible outlet.
9140 2018-08-25 17:45:50 Petronas-linked counters lead the oil & gas stocks. Among the factors supporting the rally:

1. Improved sentiment on the local market
2. Higher crude oil prices
3. Lower product & freight costs
9141 2018-08-25 17:45:42 I'll be your mechanic  & change your Oil

9144 2018-08-25 17:45:13 With his nod, she took her hands off him. Turning around and facing the switch, she began to make her way towards it. The moving floors and the oil on her feet made it a bit difficult to get to the other side. She was flailing her arms, trying to stay balanced.+
9145 2018-08-25 17:45:10 A friend told me the other day that he found splatter of oil on all 4 walls of his bedroom. Do you know what oil is used for?
9146 2018-08-25 17:45:00 I highly recommend CBD oil.

9156 2018-08-25 17:44:24 Fourth, so the lack of Oil production is what you call Oil war??? Oh my gosh, what other insects do you have in your head besides roaches?

Also, regarding Greece... Corruption is yhe answer... ask your idol Maduro we knows well about that...
9157 2018-08-25 17:44:14 i lack proper languages, but 

i’ve been doing a aloe vera oil w/ eucalyptus & spot treatment shea butter at night because i’ve been getting some nasty dryness on my cheeks. 

then tried and true vitamin E + argon in the AM.

9160 2018-08-25 17:43:50 The bulk of the overall economic value of soybeans lies in the meal, not the oil. The livestock industry needs the meal than the oil industry needs the oil. There are a wide range of different oils you can use. As Bruce Weber, director of soybean product line grain marketing (1)

9162 2018-08-25 17:43:14 Except for the fact that the US government has assets of $269.6 trillion dollars worth of land, buildings, gold, oil, cash, stocks and bonds, you might have a point.  But you don't.

9164 2018-08-25 17:42:58 Even though i have AAA and roadside assistance i am grateful to know how to change a tire and do other basic things to my car. Everyone should learn how to change a tire, check your oil, check tire pressure and keep jumper cables/give a jump.
9165 2018-08-25 17:42:55 kinda random but i had a weird dream tonight where there was a fat shaman bathing in oil in a plastic pool wearing this sick leather outfit with bone accents and accessories what the actual fuck???
9166 2018-08-25 17:42:27 I think I’m getting to the age where olive oil of a decent quality is a non-negotiable
9167 2018-08-25 17:42:21 I'm not sure how eletricity produce more co2. Sustainable energy proven the other. Global warming is worsen since the oil industries booming, and rapidly grow ever since. The key is to balance the damage we have done.
9168 2018-08-25 17:42:20 Third, Why Chávez daughter who lives in NYC is worth $4.2 billion when Chávez was a middle class man...
What Chavez and Maduro did with the money from the Oil when a barrel were $120 each... why PDVSA only produces 1.3 millions now when before Chavez they produced 3.6 millions?
9169 2018-08-25 17:42:19 Right? And customers are screaming at you and you burn yourself with oil
9170 2018-08-25 17:42:11 Did @marieclaire ever correct their "glass hair" article or are they going to stand by calling a silk press or a spray of oil sheen "glass" while excluding black women, & where it REALLY started?
9171 2018-08-25 17:42:11 I guess the real definition of 'fool' would be acquiring and amassing all the certifications western education offers and your inability to be sagacious enough to head a government,the military and the oil industry.who is the fool here?
9172 2018-08-25 17:42:10 One of the great things of fatherhood is laying down under the van together to show your kids the dirty old oil flow out when you remove the drain plug!
9173 2018-08-25 17:42:08 Leave a block of coal tar soap out for her

9181 2018-08-25 17:41:19 I lived in Canada between 2013 and 2016. Outside of Ontario, people were hit by the oil crash in 2013. Thousands were out of work and the cost of living was increasing. 

The GDP growth rate doesn't show the actual impact on the ground.
9182 2018-08-25 17:41:10 Why does that needed the looks like motor oil or, ya know, it's beginning to be a clue.
9183 2018-08-25 17:41:07 I can’t wait until a month from now and I can see if this vitamin e oil on my face at night is working

9186 2018-08-25 17:40:44 I need a new refreshing cleanser to suck all this oil out
9187 2018-08-25 17:40:42 Snake oil!
9188 2018-08-25 17:40:41 Yup. Not even close to those given to oil industry in the last 50 years.

9192 2018-08-25 17:40:21 Grilled cremini mushrooms & several ears of corn, diced up a couple of blocks of mozzarella and halved some tomatoes. Everything on the plate was from the market, including the oil & aged balsamic.

9195 2018-08-25 17:39:51 CBD and THC are two different chemicals. If you get full plant cannabis oil from a marijuana plant, it is likely to have THC in it. When getting full plant from hemp, that is when you don’t have traceable amounts of THC.

Hemp seed oil has a 3:1 ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids a balance that shown to support heart health and promote proper cardiovascular function
9204 2018-08-25 17:39:11 The idea of “peak oil and gas”originated in the 50s (bologna idea). Since then we have found shale which will last for quite some time and I can’t imagine we won’t find more. Your windmills and solar panels are no better for the environment than anything else.
9205 2018-08-25 17:39:08 Trudeau would rather import oil from his friends Saudi Arabia and Iran
9206 2018-08-25 17:39:01 Push for nuclear. It can replace oil, gas, coal, biomass, etc, with almost zero emissions.

Whilst we dabble with wind and solar we will remain using fossil fuels.

Switching to EV's will increase electrical demand massively.
9207 2018-08-25 17:39:01 Second, the sanctions are against the crooks who "govern" in #Venezuela... because they had stolen more than $300 billions in 20 years of wonderful #Socialism, the "Empire" is still buying Venezuelan oil.. so what sanctions are you talking about?

9212 2018-08-25 17:38:47 Well, I just meant, going into fall/winter, if the wipers are old and tired, i'd replace them. If you need an oil change (usually every 5000km for me) then you change the oil filter as well. Passenger cabin filters likely are good for a year or more in urban areas. Just my 2cents

9220 2018-08-25 17:37:48 How many Republicans are invested in Jared’s prison reform and jail programs? How many invested in weapons? Oil? Land grabs? Waste management? This is most likely where GOP money is being cleaned in layering schemes.
9221 2018-08-25 17:37:47 I yell at cooking shows like men yell at sporting events. “YOU DIDNT  EVEN SWOOP THAT HUMMUS!! CALLIN IT IN WITH NO OLIVE OIL DRIZZLE?! JUST CAN*NOT* BE BOTHERED TO PULL TOGETHER A GARNISH TO SPEAK OF?!? SEND THIS IDIOT TO THE DISH PIT.
9222 2018-08-25 17:37:36 No time. A wave of pesto, capers, peanut butter, black-bean chili oil and sun-dried tomatoes was headed under the refrigerator. I had to move fast.
9223 2018-08-25 17:37:23 My darling, even Beyonce say pretty hurts. There is no glowing without some amount of oil in ur regimen.
9224 2018-08-25 17:37:14 They are removing regulations which directly affect air and water.  There is no surgical precision but wholesale sledgehammer removal.  Whatever is best for oil gas and coal not for people.

9228 2018-08-25 17:36:52 Louie and yet the real "trick" behind all this is to get a head of steam and start knocking some "cans" around and yet what is the safety in numbers if your friends are left behind in a bowl of Canola oil and yet stroke is the leader killer not just behind "door to emergency room
9229 2018-08-25 17:36:40 And it can make it even more beautiful. I’ve always loved this picture.

9232 2018-08-25 17:36:02 Kids get lice? Skip the chemicals. Instead, add tea tree oil, rosemary and lavender to a big bottle of conditioner. Saturate the hair after washing and leave it on overnight (shower cap). Do this for 5 days. This method often allows you to skip the comb out 2!

Put it generously on the wounds everyday, as many times as you need if it rubs off. And while he sleeps.
9235 2018-08-25 17:35:42 To be frank, nothing is perfect. There are drawbacks to anything. And keto leaves you looking skinny fat. No striations. No vascularity. You end up looking like your skin is filled with oil. Gross. Also correlational. All this crap.
9236 2018-08-25 17:35:35 Yeah, it’s obvious she’s incapable of empathy.
9237 2018-08-25 17:35:06 The word energy and scheer are like oil and water
9238 2018-08-25 17:35:01 I think a bunch of those Rs are being promised a cut of that 500 billion Russian oil deal that’s been scuttled so far by sanctions.

9240 2018-08-25 17:34:57 The oil company analogue of Berman's behaviour would be to say that the emissions cap was bullshit, and intensity targets should be ignored. There are voices in the sector who think that, but they aren't the CEOs of the big players.

9242 2018-08-25 17:34:50 I still want electoral reform and serious action on climate change. Liberals broke those promises. No more oil subsidies. Who do u vote for? Dumb or dumber.
9243 2018-08-25 17:34:48 Amusement park in a food packing factory. In big olive oil tins, we slide down wooden chutes in olive brining liquid. As I climb from the pool, I get entangled in several pointy metal racks covered in chicken parts, the ground coated in chicken fat. Gross. #dream

9245 2018-08-25 17:34:15 Ass holes! Are they oil paintings!?
9246 2018-08-25 17:34:11 I never truly understood that "false etymology" was a thing until the Alt-Right claimed that calling someone a "pussy" was short for pusillanimous and was therefore not sexist. The new one now is apparently "virgin blood" not referring to sexual virginity but as in olive oil.

9254 2018-08-25 17:32:42 Given the state of the oil economy under the CPC, Western Canada was decimated economically. 

Portugal had austerity forced onto it until this current socialist government was elected. The EU didn't help them, it hindered them. Just like Greece.

9274 2018-08-25 17:30:27 True, but LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM is not supported for Hebrew Biafra the origin of most Black Americans Becuase of British Govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. AMALGAMATION of Nigeria by the British govt 1914 to 2014 has EXPIRED. REFERENDUM SOLVES THE GENOCIDE.

9276 2018-08-25 17:29:55 When your gov budget's based on oil co revenues you must expect your income to crash every 10-15 years or so.
9277 2018-08-25 17:29:29 PERSONAL! Fossil fuel production and combustion into our atmosphere must be stopped. I 'd buy hybrid car. I like Mr. Musk's move.

9278 2018-08-25 17:29:19 I think it is safe to say the oil and gas companies involved also did the same, no?

9284 2018-08-25 17:28:31 Trump represents the last ditch effort for the oil industry to maintain net energy gains. @StateDept offers 14000 oil and gas leases, only 1% were purchased. Peak oil is here,  No back up to prepare for this collapse. Its a total die off, not just a market correction.
9285 2018-08-25 17:28:29 Petrol pump dealers claim oil companies are forcing them to display Modi’s photos at outlets. 

This is a prime example of crony capitalism.

Bharat mata ki jay 
9286 2018-08-25 17:28:28 The irony here is that Venezuela was victimized by Chavez's good luck. Chavez took over when oil was $11/bb and the good luck of rising oil prices--to over $130/bb in June 2008--covered up a lot of incompetence, malfeasance and fraud.  Which made the crash that much more painful.
9287 2018-08-25 17:28:22 Boy that oil sneak up on ya 
9288 2018-08-25 17:28:19 Seguro? X que por varios lugares están radicando TERMOELECTRICAS a gas oil y gas que de sustentable tienen NADA y en lugares no aptos como zonas residenciales. Y  estos proyectos eólicos se hicieron en zonas que DESMONTARON. O sea... HAGAN, PERO FÍJENSE DE HACER BIEN LAS COSAS.

9293 2018-08-25 17:27:49 Does this have anything to do with the Qatar oil pipeline? 
Two proposed routes.
1. Iran
2.. SA
Both go through SYRIA (that’s a clue) to end at TURKISH ports.

All about oil, right Hillary?

9296 2018-08-25 17:27:27 God bless Bauchi, i was there 1999 - 2009. Schooling and some work. Shops and sellers at the Yelwa Tudu market would only cover their wares with a plastic wrap. Even though it was a major pathway to Kaigadama, 5km away. I met the most honest guys there.

We'd refuse to cut down on oil & coal use to save the world

Then demanded to have it taken off her bill after she ate half! And since we couldn’t remake it she didn’t want it

It’s not up to us to choose the leaders of any country except ours. Our govts need to butt out. They never act for humanitarian reasons.
9403 2018-08-25 17:12:15 Cooconut oil scandal is not new. P&G started that scandal by pumping $1.5 million into @American_Heart decades back to sell toxic CRISCO. These experts are shameless. Ignoring their advise is great for human health.

9439 2018-08-25 17:08:06 No.  Olive juice is that stuff that you get in a can of black olives after you eat all the olives.  It's when you squeeze the water out of the fruit of the olive. 

The oil is different - it mostly comes from the olive's skin, and is in greater quantities in greek olives.

9456 2018-08-25 17:05:34 So SpaceX was completely funded from incentives?  Not likely.  Nothing like oil. The government likely did offer great incentives as the powers to be want NASA to be more research and less about hardware. Space exploration needs to be commercial for economies of scale.

9549 2018-08-25 16:51:51 yes that's very true, but for now Venezuela heavily depends on oil exports to US: US market took 42pc of the total July exports of oil from Vnz. How important is Citgo? I can't really say

9581 2018-08-25 16:47:00 Based on his words and actions so far, it’s:
1. Trump loyalty
2. White nativism/white nationalism
3. Kowtow to the oil & gas industry
9582 2018-08-25 16:46:42 Why the hell have I been at NTB for 2 hours now getting an oil change. 
9583 2018-08-25 16:46:41 oftentimes, thriving communist and socialist states are intentionally sabotaged by countries manipulating markets as is the case of venezuela when the US and saudi arabia jointly crashed the oil market

9586 2018-08-25 16:46:21 No, because in Venezuela they are subject to US terror by sanctions, not able to sell sufficient oil, and dealing with a permanent state of CIA destabilisation. You see the problem, right?

9602 2018-08-25 16:44:33 @aeberman12 A scatter plot with  DXY vs oil price would represent the correlation nicely.
9603 2018-08-25 16:44:29 It's peak cheap-oil. When the cost to extract, refine and transport a barrel equals a barrel of oil, then peak oil.

9657 2018-08-25 16:38:04 So, you see, it isn't about Cannabis oil not working, they know it works, it's all just being stalled until BigPharma can get their patents in place - meanwhile - we suffer, needlessly, and they don't care, because $$$$$$$.
9658 2018-08-25 16:37:47 How much is a company worth that burns  like an old car burns oil?

9661 2018-08-25 16:37:29 @CaptainMarcinRX 
Do you think you could add in a sunken ship graveyard that you can navigate through. Or maybe an oilrig platform that the oil tankers can go to and bring it to inland stations at ports. And maybe rough weather and big waves that can sink smaller boats?
9662 2018-08-25 16:37:28 I'm getting my oil changed n this older man who is also getting something done to his car is walking about lookin at what is being done n for some reason that makes me feel like I should too

9664 2018-08-25 16:37:12 YOUR OIL EYES
YOUR OIL EYES

SPARKLING LIKE TWO DIAMONDS IN THE DARK CLOUDS OF FUEL GAS

YOUR OIL EYES...
9665 2018-08-25 16:36:57 Libya whose citizens had the highest standard of living in Africa?! Yeah we’re doing a great job, rampaging around the globe, inflicting “democracy” on countries with dictators, (whom we previously supported), only if they have oil we want to steal!Leaving a trail of carnage.
9666 2018-08-25 16:36:53 she gave me some sun oil to put on, didn’t know it had bronzer, currently looking like a slice of orange cardboard paper
9667 2018-08-25 16:36:38 You seem to be a smart man, if we are or becoming the worlds largest producer of oil why is the price of gas nearly $4.00/gal in America? 
Don't worry I really do not expect a logical, factual answer.
9668 2018-08-25 16:36:30 It depends what you call tastiest. I find some tomatoes too sweet. I just love a marmande sliced with onion and olive oil, warmed in sun. Reminds me of childhood holidays in France
9669 2018-08-25 16:36:22 there’s no such thing as “human rights-friendly, feminist oil”

9671 2018-08-25 16:36:08 Cannabis oil,I give it my guy. No THC in it so he doesn't get high. Cannabis oil is a natural ant inflammatory.
9672 2018-08-25 16:35:58 He doesn’t care about that. Trump has no regard for any living being on earth. His only interest is to sell our health & our planet to big oil and the food pesticide King, Monsanto. It’s all about money! He needs to be impeached ASAP!
9673 2018-08-25 16:35:44 
9674 2018-08-25 16:35:43 I have no interest in reading your biased crap. Except to check in every now and then to see what snake oil you're peddling that day. You know - know thy enemy and all that. Thanks anyway.
9675 2018-08-25 16:35:29 I heard coconut oil is full of saturated fat
9676 2018-08-25 16:35:28 No oil tho....
9677 2018-08-25 16:35:25 read edible reviews cause some of these sites sell them and you see they only have 5 pieces in a pack and it takes about 3 pieces to really feel the effects (the jolly green oil party pack is 1000mg! it is really the best deal)
9678 2018-08-25 16:35:22 Dare I ask if the alternative contains palm oil?
9679 2018-08-25 16:35:21 Oh there’s a “brilliant” and lazy response. What do you think people would drive if we had more electric stations, plug in stations, more affordable electric cars? Oil and gas keeps this from happening. I know it’s hard for you, but try and keep up. #copolitics
9680 2018-08-25 16:35:13 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
9681 2018-08-25 16:35:11 Ladies what growth oil do you use when you have a sew in? I don’t want nothing to weigh down my bundles and look oily. Lemme know something 
9682 2018-08-25 16:34:42 What are these fires doing to the carbon emissions stats ...don’t blame Alberta oil ...
9683 2018-08-25 16:34:36 I heard you can even put black seed oil on yo  and make it grow. But  idk
9684 2018-08-25 16:34:15 Just signed up! You should do oil filters every 3 months, too! I’d remember to change my oil more.
9685 2018-08-25 16:34:12 Tamanu oil stinks. STINKS. 

To all the losers who giggled and said garbage lies like "oh, it's a mild..." you're all damn liars.

Your blends stink. Your lies stink. Your soap is garbage.
9686 2018-08-25 16:33:50 What are the benefits of black seed oil?
9687 2018-08-25 16:33:39 Won’t need saving unless the CIA undermines its own country at the direction of oil bankers.
9688 2018-08-25 16:33:38 Why don’t you show as much respect for the health of the people in this country and less for big oil and big mergers! You have no respect for any living creature on earth! You are a disgrace to the world!
9689 2018-08-25 16:33:37 I’m doing my own experiments with my body. 2 weeks of oregano oil and black seed oil.
9690 2018-08-25 16:33:32 
9691 2018-08-25 16:33:24 You know you an adult when the dealer calls you and tells you there’s more wrong with your car when you just wanted an oil change 
9692 2018-08-25 16:33:20 Born to the Blade Ao3-style tags: perfect cinnamon roll too pure and too good, burned cinnamon roll he tried so hard but the world is crumbling around him, totally not a metaphor for peak oil, colonialism is bad and it fucks with your brain, frenemies galore, magic fencing, +

9694 2018-08-25 16:33:08 Walmart fucking takes forever to do an oil change 
9695 2018-08-25 16:33:02 The rules look good in “ethical oil” propaganda ads.

9700 2018-08-25 16:30:45 It truly is a crime cabal a family of snake oil salesmen and grifters
9701 2018-08-25 16:30:41 In the meantime, you’re selling our planet to big oil and pesticide giant, Monsanto. How many have to die so you & your friends can get richer? I’m so sorry I. Opted for you!
9702 2018-08-25 16:30:37 Whether it's believing snake oil salesmen or believing email spam (It must be true. I read it on the internet.) or believing Fox News right wing propaganda, Americans have always been lazy and gullible. @MSNBC

9705 2018-08-25 16:30:00 OUR TAXES should fund Education & Heathcare not SUBSIDIZE (Corporate Welfare) already billion dollar industries like Oil! We give $100 billion just to oil. If we didn't give corporate OUR taxes WE'D be buying supplies for schools NOT THE TEACHER!
9706 2018-08-25 16:29:54 Tea tree oil smells strange
9707 2018-08-25 16:29:47 Aapke coconut oil se toh bhagwan bachaye.

9710 2018-08-25 16:29:30 No pipines so we can buy oil from the Saudis
9711 2018-08-25 16:29:19 For a patch of stuck stickers, try putting a small amount of vegetable oil on the stickers to loosen their grip. Then gently pull them down the fur one at a time. If they are moving freely, you can advance to gently using a comb. If you use a comb, tis the season for burs!
9712 2018-08-25 16:29:18 This administration is trying to decimate the parks by allowing Big Oil and others to again rape the land.
9713 2018-08-25 16:29:16 In the meantime you want to pollute our air & our water by selling out to big oil. And you want to kill every creature in earth by selling out to Monsanto ‘drilling all over!

9715 2018-08-25 16:28:50 use garlic/oil of oregano, never antibiotics. i have only been truly sick twice in my life, get your vegetables to detox your body, i couldn't live without vegetables, it is kind of important, feel free to boil them for a split second, every time i catch mine boiling i freak out!
9716 2018-08-25 16:28:44 True. I'm taking some fish oil which seems ok. Also can eat some nuts if I don't eat too many at one time.
9717 2018-08-25 16:28:42 ゴールドアップルしょっぱかった
9718 2018-08-25 16:28:40 Agree..Gradually economic crisis is turning into humanitarian one  and once an Oil reach economy now even don't have enough to feed.
9719 2018-08-25 16:28:26 Is it ok to just double cleanse with coconut oil and a face wipe & leave it? My skin has been doing better since I started doing this (acne wise) not sure if I should do anything else since I have oily skin though.
9720 2018-08-25 16:28:23 @Jaimelynne7786 so check your car s websight for mileage maintenance ideas. if you drive alot change oil every three months. rotate tires once a year.
9721 2018-08-25 16:28:13 When I see how Qatar and Saudi Arabia
are using their oil money I just sit and ask
my self if Nigeria is selling coconut oil
9722 2018-08-25 16:28:11 Stop oil and mining contracts on National Park land. No offshore drilling on Pacific Coast.  #NationalParks
9723 2018-08-25 16:27:54 I'd love to rub baby oil on your behind and get you in a rear choke hold until I erupt against your shiny latex bum
9724 2018-08-25 16:27:52 face oil
9725 2018-08-25 16:27:51 I've been told the leaves also get bitter when the plant is allowed to flower. Not sure if there is truth to that. 

Also, my mum suggested adding olive oil to cut leaves and pureeing them and storing them in ice cube trays. Perfect portions for cooking and fresh in the Winter.
9726 2018-08-25 16:27:38 Trudeau also loves #albertatarsands oil that results from the rape of the earth for the record.
9727 2018-08-25 16:27:38 So they need anointing oil rather than greasy oil, I guess. Exorcise the things 
9728 2018-08-25 16:27:33 เข้าพระนครแล้วจะไปใช่บริการจร้า
9729 2018-08-25 16:27:17 Looking at pics from my fave's wedding and ama cry. Love sweet die. Ofc with (oil) money.
9730 2018-08-25 16:27:12 What about stopping all this talk of an informant bc most don’t care. We care about your disrespect of all living beings by selling our planet go big oil, Monsanto, etc! You have no regard for no one! And I’m sorry I voted for you!
9731 2018-08-25 16:26:38 And I’m just like...I came here for an oil change dassit
9732 2018-08-25 16:26:38 moist dlu, soal nya oil lama nyerap nya

9734 2018-08-25 16:26:24 “i don’t like the fact that the oil separates from the peanut butter” - my dad, weighing in on hot button issues
9735 2018-08-25 16:26:06 Face oil dulu sih setaukuuu
9736 2018-08-25 16:26:00 Wash & oil your scalp before you go to the barber shop or everybody going to be talking smack behind your back after you leave
9737 2018-08-25 16:25:54 Misleading media claim false travel warning to Cancun.....It is only a retaliation from USA business and Trump to destabilize tourism in Mexico. Why because of NAFTA.  Because Amlo wants to change the rules of how to buy oil in Mexico. Is my opinion. In google, can't opinion.
9738 2018-08-25 16:25:42 He also sneakily put in this trash idea of the innocent colonizer - all these repressed “immigrants” from Europe who were fighting for freedom and land “just like” the Natives were. So, we are just going to gloss over Manifest Destiny, greed for oil and gold, and white supremacy?
9739 2018-08-25 16:25:42 I'll be there!
9740 2018-08-25 16:25:38 I like this
9741 2018-08-25 16:25:31 Really. Why worry only about Iran. Do they run around in Bikinis in Saudi Arabia or UAE or Qatar. Iran must reform for its own sake. America’s motives to reform are far from altruistic- it is about energy(oil) security and strategic Israel policy. Stop the non-sense.
9742 2018-08-25 16:25:20 So ayun... tumapon yung efficascent oil sa kama.. sa unan.. sa sahig... amoy eucalyptus yung kwarto ko rn. funnmn 
9743 2018-08-25 16:25:12 @TGBrews do you anticipate to have any term oil regular or variants available for the final session?
9744 2018-08-25 16:25:03 
9745 2018-08-25 16:24:51 And yet we continue to buy their oil over our own, what will it take to convince eastern CDN’s that they are supporting this type of behavior
9746 2018-08-25 16:24:46 3: Cannabis Oil
9747 2018-08-25 16:24:41 So, the person who was former Minister of Justice and Attorney General during the scandal filled years of the BC Liberals and a big promoter of Big Oil and the Trans Mountain Pipeline is endorsing a candidate.

9754 2018-08-25 16:23:46 My mama nor dey use ear hear travel and my olive oil is finished in the same sentence.

God keep her to enjoy the fruits of her labor
9755 2018-08-25 16:23:26 I’ve been doing this is minus olive oil and my hair is brittle af.  I thought it was from washing it too much
9756 2018-08-25 16:23:12 I disagree
Oil & water still won't mix
No matter how much "opportunities" you give it
You can not have 2opposite beliefs
You just cant
9757 2018-08-25 16:22:46 I’m about to make my own lavender infused oil and hopefully a body scrub soon if i still have coconut oil. If it works well, maybe I should start making them for people lmao

9759 2018-08-25 16:22:29 Or take high quality of krill oil
9760 2018-08-25 16:22:27 No mention of tea tree oil products which are anti-inflammatory/infectious.

9762 2018-08-25 16:22:08 “Ok gotta drop the car off at 9am for oil change and whatnot”
“Should be done by 10? Easy I’ll go next door to the diner and grab breakfast that’ll kill the time”
“That was a good breakfast. Should be almost time to get the car right?”
9:19am
“........dammit”
9763 2018-08-25 16:22:05 I was told about peak oil around 1980. 2018 and still we have more oil than ever before. The Stone Age didn’t stop Because we ran out of rocks
9764 2018-08-25 16:22:03 That isn't necessarily true, there are a number of chemicals that can induce miscarriages or otherwise terminate pregnancy without harming the individual, Pennyroyal Oil for example, so this pill is probably one of those
9765 2018-08-25 16:21:48 General dislike? I despise Cruz.

9769 2018-08-25 16:21:33 “We are going to reduce our dependency on foreign oil,”said Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign. Investors Business Daily reports for the first time in history, Texas exported more oil than it imported… Promise made, promise kept #winningfatigue
9770 2018-08-25 16:21:28 just use tea tree oil big sis
9771 2018-08-25 16:20:51 The man is a snake oil salesman. He's committed multiple felonies and you sl just give him a pass.  

The GOP are complicit in Russia treason. And they are hiding their crimes. 

He's added more swamp.
9772 2018-08-25 16:20:27 Self made billionaire Folorunscho Alakija fearlessly took on the crude oil industry which at the time was dominated by global giants. She won. She inspires.

9774 2018-08-25 16:20:20 Itu face oil sayanggg. Kalo manfaatnya cek di deskripsi produknya aja di e-commerce
9775 2018-08-25 16:20:03 Just hope they’re not sitting on top of some oil or gold or whatever the fuck else the Western world kills people for
9776 2018-08-25 16:19:58 By not responding he tells us that he is a climate-denier. Like all climate-deniers he is the property of Big Oil &, if elected, he will do their bidding, not ours. #VoteBlueJersey
9777 2018-08-25 16:19:47 You are putting spin on a story only because he happens to be an undocumented immigrant, that's it. No mention about the beast that strangled his two girls, killed his wife and buried them in an oil barrel because he was having an affair and they were inconvenient
9778 2018-08-25 16:19:43 Human nature sunflower oil please 
9779 2018-08-25 16:19:42 Wow...so true..

9781 2018-08-25 16:19:31 Hi Bradley.  I’m a friend of Jayme.  I’m working in Prudhoe Bay Alaska.  That’s the beginning of the Alaska Oil Pipeline.  Hope you have a wonderful day.

9783 2018-08-25 16:19:17 4. To paraphrase HG Wells the states have been jealously eyeing up Venezeula's oil for decades. 40 yrs of failed Neo-Liber economics. Two CIA attempted coups. RW financed insurgents and collusion with other US friendly SA nations, have their finger prints all over Venezuela.
9784 2018-08-25 16:19:14 Imagine you can control electricity. Free power for everybody. No more use of fossil oil to power the world. No more global warming. HAH You just saved mankind from extinction. Then our body is controlled by electric impulses. Control that and you can have a heart
9785 2018-08-25 16:19:06 Chili oil, olive oil, crisco, tobasco sauce, charcoal, dryer on high for 1 hour. Repeat as necessary. #Costuming #LAThtr
9786 2018-08-25 16:19:03 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
9787 2018-08-25 16:18:58 Culture is important & only higher culture will change it without conflict.
So if ladies develop a higher culture of
washing cars
changing plugs & oil filters
starting the gen
breadwinning
& frequently give good head
who cares if they don't friggin kneel?
9788 2018-08-25 16:18:50 Aku jenis yang 'burn the midnight oil', bukan 'early bird catches the worm.' Maaflah, malam malam baru produktif.
9789 2018-08-25 16:18:49 So you can walk around outside without your head covered alone? 

Saudi Arabia is a shithole, your lucky it even exists and by the end of the century when the world moves on from oil it wont.
9790 2018-08-25 16:18:47 And soon, if your husband has his way, in place of the parks we'll have beautiful oil rigs and coal mines. Your hypocrisy is awesome!!
9791 2018-08-25 16:18:38 Face oil say. Worth
9792 2018-08-25 16:18:32 so i got oil last night not remembering i broke my nail & it was after 8 so all the smoke shops around mv were closed so couldn’t get one my bf did the most just for me to be able to take a dab my point is he finds a solution to almost everything and i appreciate him so much
9793 2018-08-25 16:18:23 I’ll be driving my 05 Toyota Camry through the 28th St Metro Cruise today if anyone wants to see it! It’s got the stock silver paint on it and a fresh oil change. Plus if you want a ride I have the 4 door edition with a nice backseat!
9794 2018-08-25 16:18:18 Oil change. 
9795 2018-08-25 16:18:09 lip oil > lipgloss.
9796 2018-08-25 16:18:04 Desi ghee or grapes oil.  Olive oil having a peculiar smell and it can burn on high flame.  
9797 2018-08-25 16:17:56 Def gotta get an oil change either today or tomorrow.
9798 2018-08-25 16:17:41 Trump is such a snake oil salesman.  Also a drama queen.  Has to make everything out like he and his administration is working around the clock to get something like this done
9799 2018-08-25 16:17:36 I put a leave in conditioner & olive oil on my hair before hand, then co-wash after the pool is imperative

9944 2018-08-25 16:00:05 I know I shouldn’t be upset in the slightest because I’m fine other than bruises, whiplash, and burns from my seatbelt, but my purse is absolutely ruined from oil leaking from the truck last night

9946 2018-08-25 15:59:25 Trying to save time & money for your business in the #oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
9947 2018-08-25 15:59:10 I suspect that they know climate change is real. But clean energy will not line their pockets. Oil will.
9948 2018-08-25 15:58:54 話は辛いけど、ちびっこ春ちゃんが出てきた上にマコ春してたので3億加点ですね…
9949 2018-08-25 15:58:53 NYX lip oil in Red Queen!!
9950 2018-08-25 15:58:49 now that i have hair longer than 3 in i need to invest in a baseball cap to hide the oil & sweat literally dripping from it. pls feel free to send tips that will keep me from having to wash my hair- sincerely, long hair trying to care but likes sleeping in too much
9951 2018-08-25 15:58:48 Well now we know where the EU stands. The EU picked Russia oil and Iran's terrorist supporting regime over their allies with the US. Maybe we should just pull out our military protection of Germany?
9952 2018-08-25 15:58:45 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies, financial conflicts, intellectual deficit, fire and fury tweets boggles the mind. Exhausting
9953 2018-08-25 15:58:25 Not Wyoming...too close to Yellowstone lol how about Georgia..Texas...or somewhere east of the mountains
9954 2018-08-25 15:58:23 PSA: Do NOT take your car to @DennisHyundai to get serviced. Their multi-point inspection on their oil changes is a complete lie. They also cannot seem to plug a tire correctly because my tire is leaking faster now than it was before they plugged it.
9955 2018-08-25 15:58:21 very late take: the concept of jumping thru paintings and entering their worlds is super cool & i don't know why mario 64 made so many level entrances just walls or a hole in the ground or like.... a pool of oil (?)
9956 2018-08-25 15:58:00 Before your rotten husband made it so they can put oil wells in the Grand Canyon if they want.  You are married to a bully and a tyrant.

Stop plagiarizing Michelle Obama.  She is so much smarter than you.  Write your own damned speeches.  She did.
9957 2018-08-25 15:57:57 And it's kinda fancy mayo, the olive oil kind.
9958 2018-08-25 15:57:48 While you are at it, focus on keeping our public land from the greedy oil, gas, and mineral companies from raping the lands and keeping Americans out of these beautiful places. Zinke is allowing these people to ruin the beauty of America!
9959 2018-08-25 15:57:38 “during the talks between Putin and Obama, the US president unequivocally stated this, complaining of Mubariz Mansimov's connection with the Russian oil company Lukoil.
9960 2018-08-25 15:57:00 400g water, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 teaspoons salt, 1.5 teaspoons sugar, 2 tablespoons powdered milk, 300g strong wholemeal flour, 300g string white flour, 1 teaspoon yeast
9961 2018-08-25 15:56:50 AI, make sure Oil gets you onto the shuttle too
9962 2018-08-25 15:56:49 Sounds like you need some 1 year/25000 mile oil.
9963 2018-08-25 15:56:45 Nothing like going to get an oil change and coming out with a new job offer
9964 2018-08-25 15:56:34 Eliminate oil & gas tax loopholes, expand child/dependent care credit, 
close loopholes in corporate tax deductions of CEO pay, 
require publicly traded financial partners to pay corporate inc tax, foreclosure prevention fund for homeowners...
9965 2018-08-25 15:56:34 Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers (CIPD) oppose the verbal instruction of Oil Marketing Companies @IndianOilcl @HPCL @BPCLimited to arrange for display of the photographs of @PMOIndia at their retail outlets. #RIPROBITY
9966 2018-08-25 15:56:22 Sounds fun! I’ll get mine and meet y’all there
9967 2018-08-25 15:56:20 Oil change done
9968 2018-08-25 15:56:20 I'm referring to the millions of barrels flooding into Irving Oil and Montreal from Saudi Arabia, while Western crude is stuck in Cushing, selling at a $30 discount.  Google it.
9969 2018-08-25 15:56:14 Oil is a global market. If it’s not pumped here more will be pumped elsewhere. Stopping pumping in CA will accomplish exactly nothing to reduce GHG emissions. We need to stop using oil to do that. Jerry Brown has us on course to cut petroleum use by 50% by 2030.
9970 2018-08-25 15:56:12 THAT WARMING OIL IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!
9971 2018-08-25 15:56:08 Shhhhhhhhh
9972 2018-08-25 15:55:55 Craziness?, it's called facts!  Trump and the truth are like oil and water.
9973 2018-08-25 15:55:46 Yep, makes me wish i was built like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. (Instead of Olive Oil ;) )
9974 2018-08-25 15:55:37 BLah blah blah.  Tell your husband to stop ravaging national park lands for craven rich oil companies!!!!!
9975 2018-08-25 15:55:36 That’s weird because animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of GHG emissions. We could stop using cars, gas, oil, electricity, etc all together and we would still exceed our carbon equivalent GHG emissions of 565 FT by 2030 just from livestock production alone.
9976 2018-08-25 15:55:33 Keratin oil conditioner.
9977 2018-08-25 15:55:26 Oil changed 
Tires rotated & balanced 
Took the Jeep through the car wash 
Been a pretty productive day 
9978 2018-08-25 15:55:24 He really has gotten bad, consumed by TDS.
9979 2018-08-25 15:55:04 Ok do any of you use a good, QUICK drying mascara?  Because I have to keep my eyes open for like 10 minutes otherwise it gets all over my lower eyelid.  I use It Cosmetics Superhero and Josie Maran Argon Black Oil Mascara and both are no bueno.
9980 2018-08-25 15:55:00 That too
9981 2018-08-25 15:54:59 As always, follow the money. Koch? Big oil? Mercer?
9982 2018-08-25 15:54:49 힝이 왓ㅈ서여 !!!
9983 2018-08-25 15:54:46 That's awesome! My neighbor's son has Dravets and he helped develop a treatment using cbd/thc oil. He's replaced 24 out of 30 meds with the oil.  It's so amazing how much it helps with seizure disorders.
9984 2018-08-25 15:54:40 Evening primrose oil &vitamin E pills, apple cider vinegar(all to be taken internally). Cinnamon, turmeric and honey mask for face. Carrot oil,lemon oil and vitamin c serum added to my lotion and I bathe with @pamcosEnt Illuminate soap. This is my current routine
9985 2018-08-25 15:54:38 Used my mommas Lush oil bar on my titties and dey aint never been so soff
9986 2018-08-25 15:54:21 Getting my oil changed 
9987 2018-08-25 15:54:16 Yep that's what I'm hearing. Will see if the trendy coconut oil I bought a few years ago is still serviceable.
9988 2018-08-25 15:54:15 “Halal oil” lol you do know we get very little oil from the Middle East right? The majority comes from the States. Not only are you wrong there but you’ve only continued to argue the bias you perceive. You’ve done nothing to disprove the points actually made in this argument.
9989 2018-08-25 15:54:07 Certainly makes the job a little easier. I usually spend as much time looking for it as I do changing the oil. Ha.
9990 2018-08-25 15:53:55 You are a VERY intelligent person. That’s why I have trouble understanding you can’t see the snake oil salesman that is Donald Trump. ANYTHING he says, his believers bow down. He really could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and would lose few supporters.
9991 2018-08-25 15:53:51 Burnt myself with oil today 
9992 2018-08-25 15:53:45 Oil Norwood is calmest bloke I’ve ever seen on a football pitch
9993 2018-08-25 15:53:44 Only time I use sheets are in hotel rooms. What the hell are they used for anyway unless you like a kleenex for cover
9994 2018-08-25 15:53:38 /beauty/ face oil itu dipakenya kapan sii??
9995 2018-08-25 15:53:35 There was one repeat (St. Tropica Hot Oil Hair Mask) that we featured in February 2017.
9996 2018-08-25 15:53:34 U pls give us a glimpse of Acche Din. 5 years over Oil prices, Rupee rate all are in bure din. Now don't blame 60 yrs tell about 56".
9997 2018-08-25 15:53:30 Any oil I think, olive oil meant to work quite well
9998 2018-08-25 15:53:09 The people at Jiffy Lube keep yelling at each other and they’re working on my car... my anxiety is so high. All I asked for was a oil change...
9999 2018-08-25 15:52:45 Im seeing those “supreme” branding oil cartridge everywhere!
10000 2018-08-25 15:52:24 My 70 year old grandma has been Mormon almost her whole life and she uses cannabis oil for her back and would NEVR vote for marijuana to be legal. Not only are they judge mental but hypocritical as fuuuccckkkk. Like they really just don’t get it.
10001 2018-08-25 15:52:20 Had shipper support pre TMX and pre KXL. Those are game changers. EE was never about cdn oil for cdn use, it was about shipping out. Hes not lobbying “against” it, he’s saying that in light of new, better options EE no longer makes sense fiscally speaking, he’s right.
10002 2018-08-25 15:52:20 وكلهم يرجعون ل بكر بن وائل(ضنا مسلم) من عنزه
10003 2018-08-25 15:52:05 Is it the oil or the sea salt, that glints in my hair?
10004 2018-08-25 15:52:00 Can't spell oil painting
10005 2018-08-25 15:51:57 그럼 전 이만 자러갑니다.. 모두 안녕...~

10014 2018-08-25 15:50:53 Waooooo! This is beautiful bro. Enjoy the sweetest sweetness of marriage, may the wine never finish and may the oil keep flowing. Flow in the "betterness" of companionship. 'Two are better...'

10015 2018-08-25 15:50:48 Put everything onions oil peppers tomatoes little bit of water salt n the microwave desired munites and check if they are cooked then ur sorted
10016 2018-08-25 15:50:37 Can’t wait for us to start mining and pumping oil out of these lands. We saved these places not for conservation but for usage of our American lives. Just think of all the commerce those lands will hold one day.
10017 2018-08-25 15:50:36 me: I exfoliated and shaved and used facial oil my makeup is going to be glowing!
my makeup: hmmm..... today’s look will be... Le Look De La Crustée
