2 2018-10-12 23:43:01 I'm not sure when it will happen but I agree. I believe commodities will play a big role in pushing market's to new highs as they did several years ago and emerging markets growth rates will all speed up
3 2018-10-12 23:39:50 Agreed. We must get to a place where people feel comfortable purchasing safe sex commodities without stigma and discrimination.
4 2018-10-12 23:28:16 It boggles the mind that any human could turn a blind eye to this kind of suffering. Animals are not commodities, they are individuals with souls. Animals form relationships, feel fear, joy, pain, and affection. Choose compassion!
5 2018-10-12 23:25:21 Pessoas comuns como o zé da feira entraram em peso no mercado especulativo e se endividaram de maneira insustentável. Adicione o fato de que o dinheiro não é mais lastreado em commodities metálicos e sim num sistema de pirâmide de reserva fracionária e você tem o caos instaurado.

7 2018-10-12 23:06:51 This is what happens when people are considered numbers & commodities, rather than as human beings. #auspol
8 2018-10-12 23:01:25 @Anhrez Ironically, and something I've remarked on before, the economic game, even without a whole suite of features or gameplay, is the most robust area of content in Crowfall atm. There is an actual gameplay loop and genuine commodities. Pretty amazing.
9 2018-10-12 22:47:00 Why are men treated as consumables, and women as commodities? That's stupid. Either they are both one, or the other. Therefore this is a double standard.

12 2018-10-12 22:15:12 Can’t argue with that sentiment. IMO the competitors are other currencies though (eg which is the reserve), and there’s not domestic competition regardless (US taxes are paid in dollars).

Digital commodities don’t serve the same purpose as currency. Thet don’t need to beef.
13 2018-10-12 22:03:04 Why incentivise them with weak offers that won't do the job? They control these commodities because of theft and violence in the first place. Expropriation would be a fair solution and could directly reduce fuel extraction
14 2018-10-12 21:50:09 It was very difficult to have a plantation and a industrialized economy on the same country(That did not end well in the United States, Brazil only began to industrialize after slave was abolished). But industrialized economies relied on commodities produced with slave labor.

17 2018-10-14 23:56:02 The 1% elites run the various governments, and they caused the national governments to borrow the money for social needs rather than having to pay taxes. I suppose the rich have stockpiled valuable commodities, so if the currency becomes worthless, they are still rich.
18 2018-10-14 23:55:05 The overall problem seems to be shit-tier men who think of women as commodities--we're supposed to be made available to them at all times, regardless of their own personal inadequacies. Women of every social group must cater to the guys while they do whatever 
19 2018-10-14 23:48:46 stocks still have angry ranges so I expect more of what we saw Friday.  Bonds though is very interesting.  seeing similar in FX and some commodities
20 2018-10-14 23:48:20 I’ve been trying to think of a way of concisely making this point, but I seriously think that if the left just leaned into Americana imagery instead of black bandannas, and there was no more commodities that signify cultural polarization, America would swing back to the center.
21 2018-10-14 23:21:05 So if I want the child to die, it’s ok?  What if the mother was on her way to an abortion clinic?

Killing another person/child/teen/elder in a non-self-defense situation is murder. Want does not determine value. People are not commodities.

23 2018-10-14 23:17:39 Actually if you do any research, half of the 1b shortfall on projections is due to restructuring in China. 300m is due to commodities- of which half (150m) is tax and tariff related. #FactsMatter small short term losses for long term gains.
24 2018-10-14 22:45:30 Simple. What does Togo or Ghana produce indigenously as export commodities to Nigeria? I'm not talking of Makossa or Kente o. Nigeria signs ACFTA & is obliged to throw her borders open to free trade. Suddenly, imported rice & used vehicles flood our market. Things we banned. See?
25 2018-10-14 22:35:41 Sure. But our original point was that there is nothing new in decommoditizing (is that even a word? ) commodities..

28 2018-10-14 22:23:38 Look around you. It is all a facade. It is all deficit financed, much of it through the accumulation of ecological debt. All those commodities--trucks, laptops, houses/villas--are expressions of intensified exploitation of workers to come. #cdnpoli #USpoli #Egyptpoli

74 2018-10-13 19:35:12 @KennethLFisher couple of reasoned pieces on Alex steel's Bloomberg commodities slot this week very bullish on commodities, oil and copper despite the macro wobble. Recall ur London ft talk how very difficult timing commode is. Same thoughts now or are you persuaded ? 
75 2018-10-13 19:26:33 Commodities are priced regardless of who is buying or selling them. You know that right?
76 2018-10-13 19:25:23 Not only is our trade 1/4th that of China's in the relationship, the products we sell China that comprise the majority of that $130 billion are products easily sold to the rest of the world because they are basic commodities.

79 2018-10-13 19:10:32 the tax regime will straw on the already burdened ordinary pple.

80 2018-10-13 19:05:42 Sadly I’m tweeting to a professor, mutual interests guides all countries relationships with each other, if we stop selling our oil (11% of total produced in the world) in $ your currency will be in free fall. Currencies are commodities. If their is demand its value goes up.
81 2018-10-13 18:58:43 Yep. And it was about the ships. Ships were precious commodities in and of themselves. But that isn't the only thing insurance is for. That's its root. Like I said, insurance is what we call imagined reality. We, humanity, created something that doesn't exist and everyone says ok

85 2018-10-13 18:27:28 Yep, USD became the world currency during WW1 when it lent huge sums of money to UK and France tobuy American products and commodities. US financed a major industrial expansions with these war orders placed by Anglo-French.
