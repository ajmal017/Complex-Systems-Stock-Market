1 2018-05-23 23:51:58 It’s sad to think I live in a world where I have so many commodities and millions don’t even have a cement floor/roof. No food, nothing. I wish I could change that
2 2018-05-23 23:51:55 This gets old. Over and over throughout history, governments have been forced to 'debase their coinage' because people would melt it down to sell as commodities. The only way to stop that was to make the material cheaper. This is well known.

4 2018-05-23 23:45:19 Economic theory can be useful to explain interactions that don't involve commodities.

Yes, much of Peterson's language objectifies and marginalizes women, but if that is the critique it shouldn't be obscured by misunderstanding the economic terminology.

8 2018-05-23 23:34:10 I’d really love to see players go on strike. These owners have absolutely nothing without them. I love the sport but having tax payers pay for stadiums while owners reap in millions plus treating players like commodities instead of human beings is turning me away.

10 2018-05-23 23:30:20 A gente sabe que preços de commodities oscilam, mas nenhuma oscilação chega tão rápido no varejo como o combustível, e só no Brasil. Ou os preços tão variando assim no “mundo civilizado”?

12 2018-05-23 23:20:18 Once again, it depends on what kinds of healthcare we are discussing. For cancer treatment, you are right. For a blood test, generic drugs, or a CT scan, which are distinct simple commodities, price transparency would work (Amazon has been great at driving down prices).

42 2018-05-23 23:01:27 It would be you liberal  morons who have no clue about commodities , just everything has to be free , allow drilling you flood the market , Russia loses market share and /or revenue . Sad you don't even know your Russians shills
43 2018-05-23 22:48:44 Control of commodities, such as entertainment, and access to commodities translates into control over people.
44 2018-05-23 22:48:29 That’s true. It seems inconsequential especially since the league is 80% Black. Those are the guys that could make the change really happen. They aren’t slaves they are million dollar commodities.

47 2018-05-23 22:23:35 What I’m bullish on:

- Resources/commodities that are finite.

What I’m bearish on:

- Depreciating assets
48 2018-05-23 22:15:34 our discussion was purely financial/economical. What is wizard supply chain management like? Do american wizards have a separate currency? Do they use cell phones? Is there a wizard commodities market?

50 2018-05-23 22:11:54 . . . . not something I'd do with equities, but with commodities I think it might really boost the win rate. If it still started screaming toward the doubled-down options (the untested side would blunt the pain), I'd get out at 2x initial credit received.
51 2018-05-23 22:07:47 Lol are gals commodities
52 2018-05-23 22:04:38 Hyperwave was found studying commodities. It works with credit, interest rates stock and bond indexes, individual stocks and bonds. The problem is, it is very rare. So much of the time it is unhelpful. When you find one, it is almost like magic.

54 2018-05-23 21:43:43 On the plus side, it's stupid, but not *quite* as stupid as tariffs on commodities and intermediate goods.
55 2018-05-23 21:43:30 I don't trade btc with leverage, but I trade silver and other commodities with leverage. It took a while for me to get a strategy for lower leverage. In the long run, it's more profitable. Plus you can sleep at night. lol
56 2018-05-23 21:43:11 @CNBCFastMoney I am all for Bulletin Boards, especially computer BBS ones. Sorry don't know much about Financial bulletin boards R They like the Chicago Mercantile (commodities) Exchange ??
57 2018-05-23 21:40:59 You’re talking about it in terms of what’s good for men here though. And if women are supposed to be delighted at their achievement of having been “snapped up” and, consequently, prevented a violent attack against others...why do they have to be commodities for the greater good?
58 2018-05-23 21:40:27 Economía de Uribe y Santos fue y es igual, la diferencia es los precios de los commodities, cuando Uribe estaban boyantes y con Santos no, aún así Santos tuvo mejor manejo de la inflación y allí están los números así les duela.
59 2018-05-23 21:35:15 There have heen some outliers -- apparel dropping, housing &
commodities remaining steady. but education, transportation, energy, gasoline, health care, new vehicles all rose rapidly (in some cases exponentially.) Wanna buy shit at walmart? Fine. Want to heat the house? Fucked.
60 2018-05-23 21:34:30 Wrong:
1) poor handling of security
2) nepotism
3) increase corruption with no action as it concern his govt
4) high prices of commodities
5) ineffective n incompetent appointees
6) lack of rule of law
7) political witch hunting
8) propaganda
9) lack of visible projects
61 2018-05-23 21:28:18 Gas prices in Wisconsin have risen from $1.99, Jan. 2017, when Obama left office, to $3.00, May 2018. This unexpected price rise will result in increased prices of basic commodities, in particular, food on supermarket shelves. This rise will consume Trump's tax crumps & then some
62 2018-05-23 21:27:49 Yeah. Recycling is a commodities business. If there isn’t the demand for recycled materials that can be turned into something else and sold, then... What you need is someone local with the entrepreneurial spirit to come up with a product

66 2018-05-23 21:17:00 The problem with treating ppl as interchangeable commodities is that they may come to think the same of you.

70 2018-05-23 21:01:01 I cannot even let a child be with my own parents. People are very naive about what many adults are willing and able to do to their own children. They see us as slaves, property, parasites, commodities to be exploited. They are psychopaths.
71 2018-05-23 20:58:41 Today the NFL showed that players are nothing but commodities. Their opinions and thoughts don't matter.  As the used to say on the galleon "shut up and row".  What happens if the players decide to not play.  Galleon stops moving.
72 2018-05-23 20:56:44 Dont sleep man.. Stay on top of world news. Just like we peep the sky and can forcast the weather, if we just peep the world news we can forcast the rise of prices on Gas, oil, and other commodities we rely on to survive
73 2018-05-23 20:52:47 Few years ago gas was over $5 in many places - then dropped dramatically. Commodities do that

If Tesla doesn't get a cash infusion soon, there won't will be a $35k model

I've driven 115+ MPH - a blast

I don't drive a pick-up. I drive an ethanol car

Your upfront costs are huge
74 2018-05-23 20:45:21 Yes, I had that same thought. We've been reduced to exporting low value commodities now. This isn't "winning".
75 2018-05-23 20:38:24 I know it just launched but I would love to see Patches and Pins added as an option to the @StreamlabsHQ Merchandise Store in the future! These always appear to be hot commodities at Conventions and amongst Streamers/Gamers. #StreamLabs #MerchStore

Women's bodies are not vessels, or commodities, or public property over which other people can dictate. The fact this is still a debate should terrify us all; 2018 and women are still having their autonomy taken away.
77 2018-05-23 20:27:11 Gas prices, like most commodities, are cyclical. I realize that the current talking point from the left is that canceling the Iran deal is raising oil prices, but oil has been on an upswing for some time now. Actually it can be argued it is a sign of an improving economy.
78 2018-05-23 20:26:37 OMG he just said

"I am bullish on ALL commodities but one.  OIL.   I'm bearish on oil"

$100 coming in no time now!
79 2018-05-23 20:24:52 It's not about being Modi's fan or disliking Congress... It's simple that at the end it's all of us who will suffer...with this hike and it has to be bought down as it directly affects all commodities. So plz undrst 1st wat he is tweeted n den reply rather than jus blindly follow
80 2018-05-23 20:22:27 Dear Black folk, please stop grooming our young men to be tradable commodities of the NFL. Owners exploit their youth, stealing the healthiest years of their lives then discard them when they no longer generate money for them. Today, the NFL sided w/ a bigot.
81 2018-05-23 20:18:36 Capitalism is a set of rituals. It doesn't require us to hold a particular set of cognitive beliefs, but that we *act* as if certain beliefs (about commodities etc) are true. The rituals are the beliefs, which, at the level of subjective self-description, may well be disavowed
82 2018-05-23 20:18:16 it is clearly not moving along well ! What about IP theft ? what about state directed cybercrime ? what about other barriers ? what about China 2025 subsidies? more sales of commodities are nothing !!! sad !
83 2018-05-23 20:06:49 Ainda penso o agravante sobre a gasolina é a especulação. Todo e qualquer commodities sofre oscilações principalmente no quesito cambial, porem só com a gasolina, a mídia anuncia de manhã e a tarde já esta reajustado nas bombas.

85 2018-05-23 20:04:41 Lula pegou uma situação econômica muito melhor do que Dilma. Manteve os pilares econômicos do Plano Real e endividou pesadamente o país. Fora isso, os preços das commodities (nosso principal produto de exportação) estavam nas alturas. Lula só surfou a onda.
86 2018-05-23 19:54:07 Ela mudou os pilares da política econômica, e manteve a política de conceder crédito a juros baixos, só que o boom das commodities, que tanto beneficiou Lula e Chávez, já havia acabado, e a conta chegou no governo dela.

93 2018-05-23 19:28:14 If you have a problem w/ @NFL anthem decision, don’t spend your money there or watch the games. The only language the #nfl speaks is ratings & money. Once again whites in power win, has little to do w/ the anthem. #Athletes are not human they are commodities. @NFLPA knows this.
94 2018-05-23 19:28:01 Hmm! Me parece q pasa lo mismo en toda América Latina: una dependencia histórica de los commodities que no deja crear! Ojala Argentina sea outlier. Lo dudo
95 2018-05-23 19:20:48 Micron is an underdog in DRAM. 3D XP is an opportunity for Micron to elevate their profile and become a solution provider rather than just selling commodities. I can see it helping to increase DRAM/NAND margins as well.
96 2018-05-23 19:20:08 Yea. Well it doesn’t “cause” per se.  It can indirectly cause one in some ways due to psychology— fear. But more than anything it is the market’s way of saying one is drawing closer or becoming more likely.  Notice commodities up, dollar up, 30 yr yield down. Dangerous cocktail.
97 2018-05-23 19:18:32 We almost made it to double digits, but that was out of like 1000 people - so I would say there is still growth potential in this particular commodities market for now!
98 2018-05-23 19:17:38 I completely disagree. You can't be rich if you're selling to only a small number of people with money. And most of the issues regarding education, and other commodities are largely because of thug governments around the world siphoning from the large poor majority.
99 2018-05-23 19:11:03 Farage is a privately educated, former Tory former commodities trader. Yeah I see what Trump is doing, ripping up peace treaties, environmental regulations, filling his cabinet with Wall Street
100 2018-05-23 19:07:10 This is also ignoring financial capitalism, which involves deriving abstract capital from abstract capital from commodities. It's the farthest thing from economic liberty. Libertarians live in a fantasy land where capitalism is concerned.
101 2018-05-23 19:04:23 Look to the market for answers. The dollar rally, gold or commodities? Look at the stocks and let the market lead your decisions.
102 2018-05-23 19:01:20 Too ridiculous. Refining and consuming the petroleum oil internally would have reduced the import balance, lowered the cost of fuel, lowering the price of commodities. My two cents
103 2018-05-23 19:01:17 I don't feel any ownership over any magical traditions, but I do get sad when I see what as fundamental human needs turned into commodities and marketed in a way that obscures the fact that we can all have this, all the time.
104 2018-05-23 18:58:40 I expect to see better strength in gold as this commodities dollar conundrum resolves itself.

108 2018-05-23 18:39:58 @ddailyreport If all the state agree to pay, How can the NLC  associate with consumer protection agency to put a stop in increase in commodities  which will not affect who the NLC his not on their side?
109 2018-05-23 18:39:51 Si no crece la cosecha de soja de USA, lo que le venda extra a China se lo dejará de vender a otro país. Y ese otro país le tendrá que comprar al exportador que ahora tenga oferta excedente por no venderle a China. Esto en teoría, dado que es un mercado de commodities.
110 2018-05-23 18:39:18 And Van Gundy was a players' coach. Adelman treated players like commodities. Yao should've had more limited minutes when he came back from his foot surgery. Ultimately, his body broke down in the playoffs and they had to rely on 62 year old Dikembe Mutombo.
111 2018-05-23 18:38:17 IRS' complicated web of extraction  to suck out wealth from everything we do; but including Cryptocurrencies (being a brand new product) is creating conflicts & problems in their neatly compartmentalized system of Currency, Property, Assets, Financial Instruments, or Commodities?
112 2018-05-23 18:34:45 @ddailyreport if the wage's of the civil servant his been increase by  the govt, the landlords increase the rent,increase in commodities,  what will happen to the private workers or Enterprenuer will get the money to meat the standard of living?

116 2018-05-23 18:22:29 True especially for commodities
117 2018-05-23 18:18:32 You have Weinstein and we have the more dangerous form called No 2. They think women are a commodities
118 2018-05-23 18:17:50 All other essential commodities pricess are stable for last 4 years but you won't talk about that instead you will talk about oil which has to be imported.
119 2018-05-23 18:16:44 Always have treated players has parts or commodities.
120 2018-05-23 18:13:19 No dude. Every government needs to give subsidies to keep commodities price in check. This government has increased taxes from 43% to 100% on petrol since 2013. This much tax is not acceptable.
121 2018-05-23 18:12:41 Problem is if Cu is not mined, it needs to be imported. Laptops use about 7% Copper, Cars, Electric Wires, Medical and many other industries use Cu. If we r importing Cu, our reserves will go down, prices of commodities go up & everything is affected.

123 2018-05-23 18:04:19 Completely agree with you sir just tell me this one thing, when tax is brought down, which will lead to rise in fiscal deficit ultimately leading to increase in inflation, amount saved by citizens in petrol will go out as increased price of other commodities What to do about that
124 2018-05-23 18:02:36 Tell @ektaravikapoor that fuel is not only used to drive partners to romantic vacations It is also used in industries which will ultimately result in price hike of other commodities. It is also used by poor farmer for whom every penny counts.Fuel price hike has multiplier effect
125 2018-05-23 18:00:54 Oil prices along with other commodities is rising maintaining upward trend but shouting brigade over prices has been invisible now days. The matter of fact is that it is high because of higher rate of government taxes like excise and vat etc

130 2018-05-23 17:50:06 It’s ticked up for the first time since Obama was elected, wages have not risen, hyperinflation in fuel and commodities costs are coming.  NK and China are playing Trump like a fiddle, and getting concessions.  A new cohort of terrorists are being recruited because of Trump.

133 2018-05-23 17:36:31 The real kicker; The @NFL made a billion, with a B, more dollars last year than the year before. 

This doesn’t have shit to do with the bottom line, it has to do with “owners” keeping their commodities in check. #ThisIsAmerica

139 2018-05-23 17:24:43 right now, i am loving BHB Billiton, Posko, Exxon, Chevron, Enbridge, and Gulfport.  Most of my money is in commodities, the majority remains in gold, the rest split between industrial metals, oil, and natural gas.  I also have large stakes in VFIAX and PIMIX as a little hedge
140 2018-05-23 17:21:45 Indeed, largely because salaries have been stagnant for years now, retrenchments, unemployment, rising cost of commodities etc. So, people are squeezed financially.
141 2018-05-23 17:19:15 $? Abortions are cheap. Adoption is too expensive for the average American. Explain that. Babies are commodities to whomever can make the most $. That is Evils hold in this world.
142 2018-05-23 17:17:21 They're just commodities to make money.

146 2018-05-23 17:09:24 Gundlach is bullish on commodities ; bearish usd + bonds, however I'm tilting towards your thesis now, perhaps something is missing in the bigger picture?

148 2018-05-23 17:05:30 @FarOutAkhtar I hope the conversation evolves from nit-picking rising prices across commodities, assets etc. to a general conversation on adopting a deflationary vs an inflationary currency.

154 2018-05-23 16:48:07 Arguably every medical/surgical procedure (with different x axis scales).Even if the marketplace (providers, payors, patients),thinks of medical services as commodities+ suffic competition, I dont think there is reason for prices to converge to 1 no. #notevenonions @C_Garthwaite

158 2018-05-23 16:43:50 @NFL - professional sports in general - a bunch of old, rich, white, execs who sit in luxury suites while the players do the work. Players get paid handsomely to play sports, but the point is these execs see them as property/commodities. The NFL has further just established that.
159 2018-05-23 16:43:13 The @NFL makes billions of dollars on the backs, legs, and shoulders of overwhelmingly-black talent, views them exclusively as commodities, and has the audacity to write that it supports "social justice."
160 2018-05-23 16:41:32 Sir, the fuel prices are soaring but so is the rate of crude oil. Being an importer of the same we really don't have much choice. And secondly, this government is trying to reduce the debt by not giving subsidies on certain commodities including fuel. Tough stance in good intent.
161 2018-05-23 16:36:14 Rejection is a necessary part of a man’s life. It inspires growth & gains him the necessary experience to deal with life’s adversities

This is especially true when dealing with women

170 2018-05-23 16:20:45 4) Fast Money Guys on TV think US stocks insulated.  Wrong, Weak International markets will cause More Weak Consumer Demand from All Affected Countries, and that touches everything from Commodities to Technology.
171 2018-05-23 16:19:40 Makes sense. World will not stop becoz of fuel price hike. People know the govt. needs money to keep the nation progressing and only source is tax. If it lowers taxes on fuel it will have to make good the gap by either increasing income tax or tax on other commodities.

173 2018-05-23 16:13:04 Exactly on this day 2012 upa increased the price of petrol by 7.24 in one stroke. Inflation at that time was high too unlike what it is today?They had borrowings from WBANK /IMF which were used for any ifra .Today we have no loans and prices of all other commodities less.

176 2018-05-23 16:10:11 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”
177 2018-05-23 16:07:51 The argument, as i understand it, is that if we change social conventions to discourage casual sex and divorce we would change the "sex marketplace" (as if people are commodities" which would open up more potential mates to these losers.
178 2018-05-23 16:05:25 Maybe.  China's been busy 1) Swapping those USD's for real assets/commodities globally, & 2) Gaining the ability to print CNY for those commodities.  Multi-currency commodity pricing = chance for tidal wave of USD's to be marked "return to sender" & sent back to US.
179 2018-05-23 15:56:46 Those who followed my advice & bought August live cattle at 98.65, raise sell stops up to 99.75. Always a risk in trading Commodities or Stocks. #Agriculture #Commodities #Cattle #Farming
180 2018-05-23 15:56:44 Main problem I observe is many (though not all) who claim animals are not commodities, and that they share dignity with humans, still refuse to acknowledge the dignity of unborn humans, and support regarding them as mere commodities or inconviences.
181 2018-05-23 15:54:52 The US already imposed high tariffs once. The Smoot-Hawley Act led to a global recession, which in turn was one of the major causes of WW I. Further, Trump has been played by China, which agreed to buy an increased amount of commodities it needs to purchase anyway.

187 2018-05-23 15:29:39 The govt has deregulated the crude price - great but what abt the tax components - I think tax on essential commodities should also be deregulated

Keeping a floor for essential commodities and than deciding upon tax rate with up and down along with the price
188 2018-05-23 15:27:38 In order to streamline the rates of essential commodities, Add. Assistant Commissioner PDA Sara Tawab Umar  inspected various shops in different Markets of Hayatabad arrested 17 offenders for overcharging and profiteering.
189 2018-05-23 15:22:37 I agree on suits and ties but disagree with cuff links. They go into the jewelry bucket which is never about function and only about showing off commodities (hopefully rare).
190 2018-05-23 15:20:33 Bridich clearly values known commodities and "veteran-ish" signings of guys with a decent track record in the league. Apparently, the problem with these signings is we are often signing players at peak value right before they enter decline.

215 2018-05-23 13:56:21 I agree with you on this. And also reduced price of petrol/diesel will further reduce price of other commodities! Which automatically will boost consumption and the demand will increase. This will further help in increasing gst revenue. Now let’s see what mr. jaitly is upto.

229 2018-05-23 13:21:53 These import activities made me questioned our government's capabilities to maintain our main commodities and comestibles.

Forcing earning women 2 hand over salary 2 husbn n not help her needy parents etc) n face physical violence n threats from husbns
250 2018-05-23 12:34:33 I stumbled upon @binkabi_io, a blockchain based platform that trades agricultural commodities within emerging markets. It reduces forex, import and export costs; creates trading histories to enable finance and insurance for SMEs, enables real-time tracking and secure payment
251 2018-05-23 12:33:03 Amir sahib people like Hussain Haqqani have developed a very thick skin and they are immune to guilt feeling like normal mortals. They are like commodities for sale and would serve anyone who could give a good price
252 2018-05-23 12:31:58 As long as it’s culturally acceptable to treat women as commodities, this will happen.
Why should money exchange hands for a wedding? Both Dowry & Bride Money hurts women.

261 2018-05-23 11:56:50 The sentiment here is valid however if you knew the shady shit going on with ICOs in the background these actions are justified. The SEC is aware of the difference between commodities/currency's like bitcoin and ICO like securities. Real crypto will be fine.
262 2018-05-23 11:44:03 Oil is not luxury but is basis need. Every section of the society need it daily in one way or other. These prices will attract prices to go high for all the commodities. Immediate attention and rationalisation is must.
263 2018-05-23 11:36:06 The African political willingness to do it is not there. We can list the commodities and the ocean economy but we are not having the leaders playing that role.
264 2018-05-23 11:28:12 Nigeria's Forcados pipeline has restarted: shipper Shoreline Group said. Traders told BBG earlier this month Forcados loadings for May had been delayed #OOTT @business #commodities
265 2018-05-23 11:26:22 That’s a brilliant suggestion, but I doubt that our leaders will increase taxes on those commodities. This is because they re all beneficiaries to the consumption of those commodities.
266 2018-05-23 11:22:30 So how do you think the foods and essential commodities r being transported all over the country. On bullock carts? #AndhBhakt

296 2018-05-23 09:41:40 Unfortunately lots of editors fundamentally see writers as commodities. Still more will agree a rate only to make you crawl over broken glass to get it (and then pretend they've done you a favour when they finally stump up).

297 2018-05-23 09:41:16 FACT!! With the ongoing heavy rains and floods, nothing can grow and the food produce already in farms are rotting due to excess water, impassable roads to the market making the price of food commodities to shoot highest... After rains, the land will dry, then drought!!
298 2018-05-23 09:34:43 Crude oil went from $52 to $80 from Mar 2017 to May 2018. Petrol went up from Rs 73 to Rs 85 in the same period. But commodities are still not impacted. This should tell you how well insulted the economy is from crude fluctuations. I'm not happy with Rs 85 but I won't crib.

300 2018-05-23 09:27:43 As commodities são todas cotadas em dólar americano. Se o dólar cai frente às outras moedas, um comprador passa a necessitar de mais dólares para comprar tal commodity. E vice-versa. Por isso a relação inversa entre dólar e commodities.

302 2018-05-23 09:22:24 Well said... Diesel impacts prices of commodities n not petrol... shall we ask govt to ban all luxurious vehicles.

305 2018-05-23 09:15:05 The IMF deal we signed a few months back, in order to access the emergency fund, will see the government remove subsidies on basic commodities and introduce taxation on petrol and petroleum products which will, in turn, affect every facet of our economy
306 2018-05-23 09:14:29 Y me corregirá el economista, pero a Uribe le tocó el boom de los commodities en toda Latinoamérica, jalonada por factores de crecimiento externo (China, India, etc).
De ese crecimiento económico latinoamericano nacieron todos esos populismos: chavismo, uribismo, Kirchnerismo etc
307 2018-05-23 09:13:34 Lol .. these guys will resort to anything but to accept that the fuel price can be reduced and unnecessary taxes should not be there on a commodity which can increase the price of many basics but necessary commodities for a commin man. 
308 2018-05-23 09:13:15 Rightly said sir, but Congress too has not done much on this. All governments aim taxes as a source of income. Some commodities fetch much.
309 2018-05-23 09:06:20 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

315 2018-05-23 08:39:03 Globally its the ‘hourglass’ shape of the export and marketing parts of the value chain that really control the price the farmer gets in commodities. Most are controlled by a very small number of global traders  whose nationality is irrelevant. Lets expose current monopoly powers
316 2018-05-23 08:29:55 Me: nuanced Marxian takes on the nature of the ebook as an intangible commodity of the information age and what this means for librarianship.
Also me: sells soul for a sweet, sweet 75% off said commodities.
317 2018-05-23 08:27:36 That, again, needs money. Either it runs on very high taxes on some commodities (including petrol/diesel) or on higher fares (which many apparently can't afford). Suburban railway may be more difficult to implement because it's entirely under cash-strapped IR.

326 2018-05-23 07:52:41 Ur obviously an idiot if u willingly spend Rs400 on trash films. But the increase in petrol rates will hike the price of vegetal, fruits, food items and other important commodities which are consumed on a daily basis. #dolt
327 2018-05-23 07:52:03 Great things like increase in the price of commodities right?
328 2018-05-23 07:35:05 Movie  is optional, it’s our choice to watch or not. But, conveyance cost, food items are essential which we don’t have any option. We need to buy them or use them for survival... If fuel  price gets increased then every commodities gets increased because it’s interlinked..
329 2018-05-23 07:33:29 It's not surprising in an society where people spend everything they make. It's sad but most Americans take our a mortgage for everything which is basically having commodities which they wouldn't have had other wise. In effect they're spending more than they're actually  making.

340 2018-05-23 07:02:28 Our roads become worse more cars by the roadside fixing a tyre after hitting a pothole. More people dying because they can’t get health care needed. The prices of commodities continues to rise and on a lighter note more signing of mega deals

344 2018-05-23 06:48:13 Vipin I understand your sentiment towards Govt being a Govt servent. Petrol is not essential even I agree too. But no veg is cheaper this time. Neither other essential commodities like Diesel or LPG cyllender. Don't go by data published by Govt, just hit local market.

346 2018-05-23 06:43:29 Besides reducing these taxes, a lot can b done to keep inflation in check. for eg, why can't we have subsidized diesel for trucks that transport essential commodities. Also, trends like work from home and ministers using public transport etc can be done to inspire the people.
347 2018-05-23 06:42:41 People r turned out to b commodities for votes and for shoots to benefit political parties and corporates respectively.

349 2018-05-23 06:15:29 GST se 3 lakh crore, other taxes se 4 lakh crore phir bhee price of petrol and diesel price touching yo sky which is leading to price rise of essential commodities for poor.
350 2018-05-23 06:14:56 Govt needs to build infra, pay employees. Taxes are primary source of income for govt. It only makes sense to collect tax for road constr. from road users and not from everyone. Essential commodities price have been kept low.

352 2018-05-23 06:01:33 With this so much money credit, why your party @BJP4India and @PMOIndia hiking the Petrol and commodities price, ridiculous.
Ppl are not interested in your explanation, they want result by end of the day, be a good boy, Don’t miss the bus in 2019
353 2018-05-23 06:00:25 Yeah right. And you need films to run your cars and trucks, so that you can transport commodities from one place to another so that you eventually get food and other essential commodities. Without films, you won't get them. 
354 2018-05-23 05:59:02 @PChidambaram_IN COMMON MAN USES PUBLIC TRANSPORT HENCE NOT BOTHERED ABOUT INCREASE IN PRICE OF PETROL.   SO FAR PRICE OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES STABLE INCREASE IN HSD DOES NOT AFFECT ANYONE.   INFLATION UNDER CONTROL SINCE 4 YEARS.   FOR WHAT HUE & CRY

1 parchar mantri -by wasting huge amount in making propaganda &speaking lies 
2 , hiking price of petrol to the record level 
3 to increase the price of all essential commodities 
4 false promises to public
361 2018-05-23 05:12:12 Sir all are fine but what about  fuel prices. .there are no Electricity 12 to 14 hours . prices of commodities going high day by day. .no impact on common people. Plz do something to benifited common people of india rather than political movement.

363 2018-05-23 05:05:10 We spoke about price fall for all other commodities before inception of GST. Did that happened? Many tweets were posted how the in-between capitalists (restaurant) use GST to increase their revenue.
GST is a good joke in India. It's not properly implemented.....
364 2018-05-23 05:01:21 Question is that does our goverment know about this and any action is taken against such crimes or Hindus are expendable commodities.
365 2018-05-23 05:00:03 They will harp on the prices of commodities which are inflated due to the market forces. They want to defame the government and hence the hue and cry over the small issues. Commie media is there to help Congress and Commies forces.

371 2018-05-23 04:45:21 Piyush, valid points. But what about the price hike in commodities due to the impact on transportation and logistics caused by #FuelPriceHike . If the Central govt. and State govt. does not control the price soon, each and every daily usage commodity price is going to skyrocket.
372 2018-05-23 04:38:24 Actually fuel price does have a direct impact on all commodities because of the dependancy on logistics and transportation. And comparing it with movie ticket cost? #FuelOnFire #heightsOfBhaktism #HippocriteBhakts
373 2018-05-23 04:37:01 When the price of fuel was going down when the price of other commodities were going down then it was due to the trends in intl. Market but now it's all govt' s fault , hypocrisy be thy name.the prices can be brought down by offering the subsidies but who's pocket gonna bear it.
374 2018-05-23 04:33:28 Petrol prices rate must be re-visited. Although many commodities are cheaper in this Government and it is commendable but fuel prices are going really high.
375 2018-05-23 04:29:21 One should not read financials of companies dealing into Commodities.....they will always show lag effects.....try understanding Commodity
376 2018-05-23 04:26:56 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
377 2018-05-23 04:25:22 Why is GST not implemented on fuel prices when all commodities are included? Why are such high taxes imposed on petrol and diesel to make it costlier?
378 2018-05-23 04:18:05 Mar moved commodities into the medical room. I have thread, crutches, cloth, splints, and buckets. However to my sadness there were no enormous corkscrews or serrated discs.
379 2018-05-23 04:13:07 The idea that people & jobs are just commodities that can be mixed & matched with advanced technology suggests that filling the open requisition is the goal, not improving job satisfaction or on-the-job performance.

Are u clear on the human role then!

380 2018-05-23 04:02:51 Was a time when that would’ve been completely legal, and it didn’t happen.  It’s the marathon, not the sprint, with time it won’t matter anyway because Wow minorities grow populations, the majority still controls commodities. Death camps won’t be the demise.
381 2018-05-23 03:55:26 His driver is walking now as the prices of commodities is so high that he can't afford the cycle also..
382 2018-05-23 03:49:23 Focus la on our solar panels, palm oil, crude oil, commodities. We can be an export heavyweight sia. Why hold back. U don't even need no moody's credit rating or gst then.
383 2018-05-23 03:47:14 Then u must have also been bearish on oil at $30. $SX will materialize its mineral and resource extraction technology & launch its mining & commodities Blockchain tech which is patented through Tiande. Just becuase you dont understand it doesnt mean its neither real or profitable
384 2018-05-23 03:46:11 @BlackThoughts91 With the fight to deregulate banks, which will lead to another crash...is Bitcoin the answer? Or buy commodities? Bonds?

387 2018-05-23 03:27:40 A new low for you too has started. You guys are putting the common pple in this shit.Will that buhari excuse nonsense change the price of commodities or will he make him start probing the likes of Ameachi. Is that why we voted him there? Pls respect yourself .........
388 2018-05-23 03:25:27 the month. That is with SNAP alone. Throw in other programs like commodities, free or reduced lunch, and WIC and a child will easily have 3 meals a day. If a child goes without a meal it is just a failing of the parent. There is no way you can blame the government or a political
389 2018-05-23 03:21:05 Empresas que têm concorrentes, principalmente no exterior e que consomem commodities que aumentam de preços não repassam aumentos semanalmente. Elas trabalham seus custos e reduzem margens. Muitas vezes são acusadas de improdutivas.

393 2018-05-23 02:59:23 Dude, you know nothing. Common man is disturbed by petrol price hikes but to use these commodities first of all they have to be alive.
394 2018-05-23 02:57:29 Porque puedo entender (no compartir) el apoyo a Chávez en pleno boom de las commodities. La fase actual es simplemente grotesca.
395 2018-05-23 02:49:11 CRITICAL for #commodities watchers: #China suspended the release of some base metal data for April, which was due today. No figures for imports or exports of refined #copper, #zinc, #nickel and zinc concentrate. Govt cited technical reasons, without detail #metals @business

398 2018-05-23 02:44:32 And you know what happened to the bailouts that were supposed to be loaned to Americans? The banks invested the money in commodities.
399 2018-05-23 02:41:34 A causa é o dólar e o efeito é sentido nas commodities.
400 2018-05-23 02:41:26 Potential for calamity aside, adding some $GLD or other commodities to a portfolio right now is apropos per this chart.
401 2018-05-23 02:40:49 Na verdade é o oposto: a desvalorização do dólar valoriza as commodities. Dólar fraco faz as cotações das cmdts aumentarem para recompor os preços relativos.
402 2018-05-23 02:36:46 Still, sex is a lot less fungible than what we usually call commodities, evidenced by how (even aside from legality) some people would find it easy to sell and some nearly impossible
403 2018-05-23 02:33:49 Pq a valorização das commodities desvaloriza o dólar?
404 2018-05-23 02:23:33 Siri doesn’t store data about you, and anonymize what it does store. Anything privacy related is kept encrypted on-device, and never goes to iCloud. That’s why I’d use it over Alexa or Google Assistant.

No idea how you think it turns us into commodities.
405 2018-05-23 02:17:25 Is opposition is only to counter governing party in elections.

Why we are not leading a front on increasing prices of commodities of daily usage for general public,petrol diesel has touched record high.

406 2018-05-23 01:48:12 @AmitShah @sambitswaraj @dpradhanbjp .....all the persons affected, irrespective of political orientation, must protest against the fuel price hike; especially diesel as it has a cascading effect on the day to day price of all essential commodities....
407 2018-05-23 01:43:32 sim e ninguém negou isso 
agora os fatores do porquê disso são fundantes
a monocultura num geral é o que torna os impactos tão agressivos e ela é justamente imposta por causa de exportação de commodities, nunca pra suficiência alimentícia 
é o lucro que mata o meio ambiente
408 2018-05-23 01:39:25 printing too much money will trigger the prices of commodities to rise. tapos may tinatawag din kasi tayong reserves ng bansa natin kaya hindi basta basta makakapagprint ang BSP ng pera. 
409 2018-05-23 01:34:30 I would like to see this platform used for commodities.
410 2018-05-23 01:04:49 Simon. If gold is only intended to be this inert sum of all commodities thats not supposed to rise in real ccy terms, that cost of production would be an easy one ? That's sure not what the miners are telling us. The sector can't even stop the bleeding at these prices.
411 2018-05-23 00:59:08 The other 50 biblllion  dollars will be donated to  community through private donations BLUES AND CARDINALS  will  receive 1 billion each

412 2018-05-23 00:57:39 A govt that is compassionate:would work hard so prices of basic commodities  lower down.

419 2018-05-23 00:43:10 Poor decision on the eagles part? How so? Cleveland squandered two first round picks for unproven commodities as it were. Not only unproven, but with better options available. #comebetternexttime
420 2018-05-23 00:34:59 That exists in Venezuela for the most part. People have the choice to buy whatever they want of what few commodities are available and private companies can produce whatever they want. You want capitalism where nothing bad ever happens for some reason and that’s just not possible
421 2018-05-23 00:32:21 Why would you want Siri like Alexa or google assistant, all of them are a terrible idea. They turn us into the commodities and remove any semblance of privacy in our homes. The data side of those is terrifying.

423 2018-05-23 00:28:11 I have the price as up 26% since Jan 1 (NA: 166k to 210k) but no matter. What I was trying to get at is that beyond how much gold trades hands to get a token, I don't feel like it changes other things, like in terms of everyday goods, consumables or commodities.
424 2018-05-23 00:22:30 All you trumpys in the USA who got the meagre tax cut. 
1. Have you noticed fuel roaring up in price.
2. Cost of living increasing.
3. Imported commodities more expensive.
4. Tax cut not covering it?
