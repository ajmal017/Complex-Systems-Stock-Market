1 2018-07-19 23:59:36 Agree 100% ....the Climate Change celebs and politicos are the biggest Hypocrites ever.  If it is as bad as they say they would never ever fly in another plane or drive  a car. Ever.

10 2018-07-19 23:58:12 I applaud your sentiments, but it will not happen overnight. What will happen to the leveraged money the banks give on loan, if people switch from bank to crypto? It will lead to massive loss of savings of people. Something even smarter needs to happen.

13 2018-07-19 23:57:48 You’re killing me.  There are small novelty transactions.  I’m not saying no one uses crypto, but there is no consumer stampede to crypto.

If crypto is ever going to get wide spread adoption, a gov’t or FI is going to need to make a stable market in crypto.
14 2018-07-19 23:57:45 Aye frog, let us know when that follow comes through!
15 2018-07-19 23:57:42 Wtf are you talking about? This is a Boston globe article, not some crypto currency bs
16 2018-07-19 23:57:38 No we won’t see this on any MSM But we know London does not represent Great Britain, London has become like a city in the Middle East London is now Londonestan Brexit should help
