149 2018-06-05 23:39:36 Again, if you believe every graph or tidbit someone shows you without questioning the underlying data, boy do I have some snake oil to sell you!
150 2018-06-05 23:39:20 Make sure to hit Dubrovnik! Olive oil and seafood!! Oh, and the 14th century walls are ok too.
151 2018-06-05 23:39:10 The blonde slut sat across from the founder, clad in a similar outfit that she had worn to her interview. She quite enjoyed Leo’s company and was glad they could spend some quality time together.

153 2018-06-05 23:38:40 If China has both CNY oil & gold contracts under which CNY is convertible, PBOC/China can control the int’l trade value of the USD thru the ratio of the 2 v each other.  It strains credulity given all else that China would not use this as it sees fit.
154 2018-06-05 23:38:03 You didn't buy coconut oil on sale did you?
155 2018-06-05 23:37:41 and i’m getting that extra tan oil
156 2018-06-05 23:37:16 And I'd suggest you get an education on the adverse effects oil and minimg at a geological scale, both of which have been confirmed to cuase earthquakes alter faultlines

Again open you mind to new theories and possibilities.
157 2018-06-05 23:37:14 oh do get a fucking grip, or remove the blinkers. 

Labour are a party in Scotland of the O/O for the working class and unemployed and blairism for the middling classes, they havent been socialists since they tried to steal our oil in 79 - only to hand it over to Thatcher.
158 2018-06-05 23:37:12 Looks like its healing well. I used bio oil and aveeno  lotion  to help the healing and making the scar less visible
159 2018-06-05 23:37:00 Coconut oil is so much tastier than my last lube. 
160 2018-06-05 23:36:51 I be using the argan oil edge control. I mean i dont really use a lot and you know i like i natural looking baby hair not that slicked down mess so idk but i like it and its not flakey
161 2018-06-05 23:36:44 Gross. Also those have the same chemical in them they use to clean oil off driveways. Look it up
162 2018-06-05 23:36:44 Malarkey. It's called MMP. Or are you for getting charter schools? At least this decision had merit and vision. We need to move away from fossil dependency and if you read Rod Oram you will understand that we have a big untapped gas field. Big oil has already walked away from NZ

184 2018-06-05 23:34:17 Economists, too, are mythical beasts. Don't tell anyone.

193 2018-06-05 23:33:04 Completely agree. Some people still use pork insulin and it seems to work 4 them. There is no snake oil out there. I've yet to come across an Afrezza user using #Afrezza for more than 2 months and not seen a massive improvement in their health. Diabetes is  struggle 4 2 many

195 2018-06-05 23:32:48 So, I was one of your subscribers on YouTube. I really liked your videos and I’m upset that your channel was deleted. 

My mom has a friend who’s channel (which focuses on Lyme disease) was deleted for her talking about CBD oil. And she even said it didn’t work for her symptoms.
196 2018-06-05 23:32:39 Every driver in America is paying extra so oil company buddies of @EPAScottPruitt and @realDonaldTrump can rake in MASSIVE profits (and pay lower taxes on them)!
197 2018-06-05 23:32:31 The Netherlands foolishly spent their oil bonanza on building a decent transport infrastructure that has served them very well........we have a two track underground that stops at 6pm on aSunday
198 2018-06-05 23:32:23 the amount of oil is making mystomach ache
199 2018-06-05 23:32:17 It was some gorilla glue oil too.. shit I was high as hell!
200 2018-06-05 23:32:12 really excited about my next painting i'm working on tonight. i drew the design on the canvas with oil pastels. then i'm going to paint over it.
201 2018-06-05 23:32:02 Just like anything else you eat if you fry it fat and oil its not healthy NO MATTER WHAT IT IS. MUCH MORE PROOF showing that it can benefit your health if its prepared right. MUCH MUCH MORE.
202 2018-06-05 23:32:01 2 oil paintings. 1 is thick oil paint done with pallet knife. The other is with thinned oil paint done with brush then pallet knife.
203 2018-06-05 23:31:15 Ahhh... you mean such as in a comprehensive Social & welfare programme, backed by massive oil reserves & mineral wealth? Google Venezuela & see how that turned out...

232 2018-06-05 23:27:49 The D.J. asserted his opinions clearly during the 2016 election campaign. It is not just D.J. @JustinTrudeau would do better to consult with Canada's & others best innovative thinkers - towards a new model of trade and economics. The UK's Brexit is a disaster. Canada worships oil
233 2018-06-05 23:27:36 I bet roasted garlic would be just as good. Cut the top off a head of garlic and roast it in olive oil until it's golden brown. Would add a nutty flavor/component to the dish. Endless possibilities...
234 2018-06-05 23:27:29 Got a free oil change, free car wash and I got a shuttle to my sisters house took a nap!! Great day!
235 2018-06-05 23:27:08 So they picked up my car to get serviced and turns out they were back ordered on oil filters for my car so they gave me a $800 service B for free. 
236 2018-06-05 23:26:57 That’s to do with US sanctions against Iran and the weak pound against the dollar. Oil is traded in dollars.
237 2018-06-05 23:26:41 You live in the me me me world. Some Industries need regulating like Banks, they're ripping you off and you like it. The oil industry welfare Kings get subsidized. I work hard for my money I'm not sure as hell not going to give it to billionaires pay it and they needed a tax cut.

248 2018-06-05 23:25:24 So, Venezuela deepened its dependence on imports paid for by oil revenues (mis)managed by the state (government).

256 2018-06-05 23:24:05 In fact, Ford's policy proposal to reduce the gas tax by 10 cents would simply permit greedy Oil and Gas corps. to raise their prices by the same amount because consumers are sadly already accustomed to high prices

328 2018-06-05 23:13:03 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

330 2018-06-05 23:12:49 Luis, that's because oil dropped to #30 a barrel, and now is back up towards $80. We will forego the benefits from that upswing, and all for no reduction in global emissions.

360 2018-06-05 23:07:59 Historically, peer reviewed literature would be the highest level of information. Corporations have figured that out. Why sell snake oil, when you can sell “evidence “. Still scammers

372 2018-06-05 23:05:57 Assuming that oil is replaced by imports, it all depends on how we model future gas consumption and replacing technologies. 80% of net gas comes from only 4 fields.

374 2018-06-05 23:05:13 Get your facts right, the tourists that come are just partly why we gain money. We export oil to the western world, and if us Arabs  didn’t, you would be living as if it was 1954 or some shit. Oil is very important, especially to MEDCs

376 2018-06-05 23:05:03 Deary me. We’d be bust already. In any case previous high oil price drove huge investment in shale oil. Us produced so much they’d nowhere to put it. If price rises much more they’ll start them up again. Green energy reducing demand. NS oil always expensive to extract. Hence GCR.

400 2018-06-05 23:01:12 When she plays hard to get, it means she wants ya. That means oil goes lower in the future. Even if we get a new cycle up, it will be followed quickly by the continuation of this beautiful waterfall :)

Slice garlic very thin the long way. Gently sweat garlic in oil. Add chile. Add pasta. Toss with splash of water and parm. Season.

421 2018-06-05 22:59:23 I'm a qualified economist, the idea that renewables will be bad for the economy is utter nonsense. Two things have caused recessions since WWII - financial crises and oil shocks. Renewables will never have the same price volatility as cartel-fixed oil does

They had 98% certainty of Hillary winning, but yet now try and explain that away. Snake oil salesmen have better track records. Polls are for losers and pundits.
427 2018-06-05 22:58:42 And where do your federal government get the funds from, proceeds of the cow trade or the oil from Fayoshes backyard? #mumu.
428 2018-06-05 22:58:35 Got an oil diffuser for the room.. can’t be smelling bad out here
429 2018-06-05 22:58:30 I had a friend back in the day who loves coffee so much, he kept one of those instant packets where you're supposed to keep your cleaning oil in your M1A 
430 2018-06-05 22:58:29 I posted about the destruction caused by palm oil plantations etc for ages on fb - no-one responded or showed any concern. Very disappointing.
431 2018-06-05 22:58:13 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
432 2018-06-05 22:58:06 Yeah its legal in a few places now in the u.s over here its not legal but people still smoke it, I can't im sensitive to everything,  the oil works for me we can get that here without the tsh, i can't do tsh makes me loopy
433 2018-06-05 22:57:29 No one forces anyone else to eat at McDonald's.

No one is forcing McDonald's to serve organic French fries fried in organic oil.

Why would courts or government have to get involved in either case is beyond me.

435 2018-06-05 22:57:22 Did you know you can eat hostas? We like the young shoots sauteed with a little bit of garlic and coconut oil, yum! #edibleplants #themoreyouknow
436 2018-06-05 22:56:45 Aloe - I bleached my roots every month for over a year, and that was what kept my scalp from hurting too much (although...it still hurt). I couldn’t use coconut oil because it made me break out 
437 2018-06-05 22:56:31 Cant trust any of these Snake Oil Salesmen!
438 2018-06-05 22:56:20 I can't wait til we run out of oil then petroleum companies can kiss my pale white ass
439 2018-06-05 22:56:14 So with todays experience at Mercedes Fredericksburg I had a 10:30 appointment for an oil change that took 3 hrs.  I spoke to this man Mr. Terry and he did not listen to anything and thinks 3hrs wait is good for an oil change.
440 2018-06-05 22:56:05 Invest in some cuticle oil! It’s essential
441 2018-06-05 22:56:02 I usually use those plus vitamin e oil on it after I shower, it’s definitely helped the color but the texture is still there. Hopefully it’ll go away eventually with doing this!
442 2018-06-05 22:55:45 It's like a movie
443 2018-06-05 22:55:31 try gloves and oil? 
444 2018-06-05 22:55:21 Remember gas is not priced at a huge discount from oil on the basis of equal power per unit. 1 tonne of LNG is much less power than 1 tonne of diesel. Therefore may not be as cheap as they think.
445 2018-06-05 22:54:58 I really want in n out like so badly right now but I can’t drive my car until I get an oil change 
446 2018-06-05 22:54:39 You have noticed the steady increase in oil price? I know the media seem shy about reporting it for some reason.

And still - no fracking in Scotland.
447 2018-06-05 22:54:34 @JubilantJourno just saw the topics pic of the debris and looked closer...why is Emu Oil with what appears to be the Australian Made logo and ‘100% Australian Beef’ being shipped from Taiwan to Sydney?

450 2018-06-05 22:53:59 Texas/Oklahoma took a pounding when Reagan burst the oil bubble. Big hit comes again, well,not much else to sustain them
451 2018-06-05 22:53:55 Everything in the modern world is made from oil, natural gas and coal - and the manufacture is fuelled by them or devices made with them. So... it creates the most jobs. No doubt.

463 2018-06-05 22:52:07 Ladies: rub olive oil on your breast .
464 2018-06-05 22:52:03 He needed a loan. Eisenhower did not approve it. After Mosaddegh downfall , Americans financially supported Iran and oil contracts were made between Iran & Anglo_American companies. This was the main reason for Mosaddegh's downfall.
465 2018-06-05 22:51:55 That road should be bombed. Oil and gas is a natural resource given to us by mother Earth.
466 2018-06-05 22:51:52 Should be. Got my fresh cut, hangers, Tide pods, and my refills for my oil warmer.

468 2018-06-05 22:51:40 That's production, not exports.   US still an importer of crude oil, just less so than before.   Also, private industry advancement in fracking produced the bump.   Can't give this one to Trump.
469 2018-06-05 22:51:34 At what point should a player justify walking off what’s the number ? What’s the circumstances? It seems to me you are justify any situation or circumstances a player should walk off? #Clarify #DarrenLewis
470 2018-06-05 22:51:31 Make the plastic manufacturers and big oil Paid to clean it up
471 2018-06-05 22:51:21 Yes but Minbij is the same. It is the WH decision. As much as we wanna think otherwise, at the end, Trump makes the call. Not Pentagon. Nd they (Pompeo/Trump) might have a similar interest also in Syria reg oil/gas etc. How do we know
472 2018-06-05 22:51:19 @realDonaldTrump gave billions in tax cuts to oil companies & it should trickle down to the public yet prices went up 
473 2018-06-05 22:51:08 Because the coal and oil guys paid me to say so.

478 2018-06-05 22:49:59 This "celebration" is part of a con job by this snake oil salesman probably staged to catch people observing who might appear to be unpatriotic so that they can flaunt it to the mass. This is something that this wannabe dictator is dying for and it's so scary.

481 2018-06-05 22:49:34 Mosadegh was debating over Anglo_American  offers to purchase oil from Iran. They were not buying oil from Iran. So Mosaddegh faced budget deficit wgich brought up dissatisfaction among people who were his supporters. So it weakened his political support as well.

483 2018-06-05 22:49:19 There is a girl at my school who does skin care tutorials and said “if you want perfect skin like me, all you need to use is coconut oil. That’s it!” But it was the butterfly filter from snap. She truly thinks no one knows
484 2018-06-05 22:49:00 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
485 2018-06-05 22:48:56 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
486 2018-06-05 22:48:30 Oil from Norway equals half our total oil imports. Nearly a third of our petrol comes from Sweden and the Netherlands.

2. Put in microwave until steaming hot  
3.  Push down on affected area.  
Cures poison ivy in about 30 seconds, This is not a joke. You chicken if you don't try..At first you will feel it really itching bad, then burning. It dissolves the oil inside the skin

494 2018-06-05 22:47:21 Sadly, regretably, the world we live in just doesn't care. That's how far things have devolved. Oil is killing all of us and the world in myriad ways
495 2018-06-05 22:47:04 My braids tight as hell, can’t wait to get home and oil my scalp
496 2018-06-05 22:47:00 I just paid my sister $10 to go get my oil changed...  at myself
497 2018-06-05 22:46:59 Use 90 weight gear oil instead of engine oil, it will make all your problems go away.
498 2018-06-05 22:46:59 Tryna find suppliers that sell their products using vegetable capsules or gels  and it's hard lads. Might have to go powder abd oil base.
499 2018-06-05 22:46:56 I'm impressed that young people of such still blamed past leaders for the brainless president @MBuhari and his failed @APCNigeria govt failure. 

Also you have forgotten so soon that the VP and Buhari were part of the past government.  Under PMB our $2.8b Oil money went missing.

502 2018-06-05 22:46:31 Started from the bottom, now I can afford an oil change roughly every 3,000 miles.
503 2018-06-05 22:46:31 Oil did not kill our economy... we did, Mismanagement. Greed, Lack of foresight, Poor leadership over the years and silly chop the National cake mentality killed this economy.
504 2018-06-05 22:46:31 Pretty sure I would drink olive oil

506 2018-06-05 22:46:29 @NZMorningReport any discussion of future energy needs that is not prefaced by energy reduction is by definition unsustainable.

Renewables and hydro, for the foreseeable future, are underwritten by oil.

Don't rely rely on industry insiders to envisage NZ's future energy needs.

513 2018-06-05 22:45:45 About 50 miles away so BPS here I come in the morning. I can run the oil they sent (25W40) bc it’s Mercury marine oil, but would rather run the (10W30) like I had in it. There went $60 to sit in the garage and collect dust.
514 2018-06-05 22:45:45 My ass!  Groceries,gas and healthcare, utilities and God fobid I have to buy a quart of oil or go to the dentist. Haven't seen any trickle down here #Lyingroyblunt
515 2018-06-05 22:45:37 In 2017, China imported 5,078,694mt of palm oil. Indonesia exported 3,215,076mt & M'sia 1,862,045mt. Balance from small countries. Source is from China's General Administration of Customs.
516 2018-06-05 22:45:36 Them: “we made brownies” 
Me: “where did you get the oil?”
Them: “ we used the stuff above the stove”
Me: ..... that was a 35$ bottle of garlic infused extra virgin olive oil....  

god I hate kids.
517 2018-06-05 22:45:25 Sure it will. Should have snake oil on the cover.

521 2018-06-05 22:45:07 In 2016 China imported 4,478,042mt of palm oil. Indonesia exported 2,643,550mt & M'sia 1,829,226mt. Balance from small countries. The fall compared to previous years is because of a drought-hit crop across Indonesia & Malaysia owing to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
522 2018-06-05 22:44:46 In 2014 China imported 5,233,891mt of palm oil. Indonesia exported 2,453,500mt & M'sia 2,870,370mt. Balance from small countries.

524 2018-06-05 22:44:42 Gotta make that shit into an oil first
525 2018-06-05 22:44:37 Interesting! In that I briefly read somewhere that there was an unusual run today on coconut oil.  "Flying off the shelves!", they said.
526 2018-06-05 22:44:27 lmao I went got an oil change & came back

530 2018-06-05 22:43:20 The sauce came out great. I made it out of a mix of soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, sugar, paprika, parsley, crushed red pepper, seseme seed oil, and black pepper. It's sweet but has a bit of a bite which is exactly what I was going for so yay me
531 2018-06-05 22:43:18 I got a 30ML perfume oil for 5k, Minus delivery.

Them scam me or not?
532 2018-06-05 22:43:09 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
533 2018-06-05 22:43:04 500000 barrels of oil a day that equates to.  But you missed the point of the article, no deal Brexit stops fuel coming in, not because it stops people trading but because without a proper customs regime after Brexit our ports get jammed up and that fuel doesn't get through.
534 2018-06-05 22:43:02 Soave is delicious with grilled swordfish dressed with diced fresh young courgettes and tomatoes, with lemon juice, best-quality olive oil, fresh marjoram, pepper and a touch of garlic.
535 2018-06-05 22:43:00 UN climate summits are a wonderful forum for speech-makers angling to secure global warming alarmism funding to save the world from the evils of capitalism, modernism, oil companies and energy, champagne, brie, baguettes, jets planes… all paid for by the poor and unemployed.
536 2018-06-05 22:42:59 You do realize what oil prices do to a city like Houston?

So this is a positive for me.

Thanks for pumping me up. We can get more money for all that oil we are exporting.
537 2018-06-05 22:42:54 I agree with Dizzle, I learned to not put butter or oil in my pasta so that the sauce can stick to the noodles. Try it next time!!! Also, can I get a plate?

540 2018-06-05 22:42:18 Ok, as promised, I asked the wife how well that spice mixture stands up to direct flame in grilling. She said it does fine, but to be safe, Massage the meat with a bit of Olive Oil while whispering about what a good boy he is. She's in a weird mood. Fun ;)
541 2018-06-05 22:42:01 Well my car over heated then oil all over ground.
542 2018-06-05 22:41:55 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
543 2018-06-05 22:41:51 Yep, but the oil industry makes a lot of profit from plastic. The hemp plant, one of G-d's greatest gifts to humanity - as medicine and raw material for a multitude of things, easily grown, would threaten that..

So ... we have polluting plastic bottles, and hemp is outlawed.
544 2018-06-05 22:41:48 And then Canada will stop sending water, electricity, lumber, crude oil (west) and natural gas to the U.S. then cancel that mess of an agreement with Nestles where they get a million litres of water for $2.25.
545 2018-06-05 22:41:37 No,  wastewater injection.    From brine produced along with the oil and gas.
546 2018-06-05 22:41:34 The health benefits are not in the THC. THC is what gets you high. The CBD is what cures you. One of my clients is the biggest producer in California of CBD oil.
547 2018-06-05 22:41:08 Interesting. Have you tried to use less oil with the blender?. It makes sense that each method requiers to adjust proportions

Coal = toxic.

Shouldn't need saying but if you oppose Lamu Coal you should also oppose the exploitation of oil up in Turkana, you should also be opposed to a refinery. 

Leave it in the ground.

564 2018-06-05 22:39:08 If there are any oil or vinegar connoisseurs out there, Olive ‘N Grape in the Village Green in Smithville is having great specials Friday night from 5 to 7. Hope to see you there

566 2018-06-05 22:38:41 Get some conditioner based on coconut oil. Coconut is a 100% unisex smell and it works great for thick, curly hair!
567 2018-06-05 22:38:36 This guy...if someone from Ontario says something it’s none of their business because they are so far away. If someone from here says something they are just NIMBYs. He has an insult for everyone but the oil execs.
568 2018-06-05 22:38:15 It's amazing how much dignity and class people will sell down the river to follow this snake oil salesman. Seriously Donald, you absurdly rant about other people's spending and then wastes many many millions to go golfing.

573 2018-06-05 22:38:05 Liz, Kevin does not care about environment. He took 35,000 dollars from Chevron after 2012 Richmond, CA oil refinery fire that sent 15000 people in San Fran to hospital for respiratory trouble. He also voted AGAINST plastic bag ban.

584 2018-06-05 22:37:19 Thank you Hon! I get flairups every once in a while. I was kinda overdue for one. Luckily some ice, advil, and CBD oil helped the pain tons!
585 2018-06-05 22:37:03 You don't have a beard and you call yourself a man? Bih you're a feminist!

Coming at me talking about how you're a better man than I am, no one is trying to impress you, I'm a man for my queens. Find your self a queen and some beard oil.

588 2018-06-05 22:36:16 So I've been trying to move away from dairy products and as a result I've stopped eating mayo and I've been struggling to find a vegan one I liked. In case anyone was wondering, Earth Balance mayo with olive oil is the GOAT. 
589 2018-06-05 22:36:13 Our concerns with the impacts of DAPL on Tribal cultural resources have been validated by independent experts. Our cultural heritage has been impacted by construction of DAPL – and is jeopardized further from the unevaluated risk of an oil spill. #StillStanding

593 2018-06-05 22:34:31 I haven’t had baby oil sex since like high school. Probably the reason why I don’t have kids yet. Cuz I don’t c me pulling on baby oil back shots.
594 2018-06-05 22:34:22 Yeah remember when Obama was president and he bombed 7 different countries for oil? What a great president 
595 2018-06-05 22:34:15 What a joke, cut programs that help the lower and middle class while keeping tax cuts for the top 1 percent ,leaving subsidies for oil companies, providing aid for corporations moving overseas.

602 2018-06-05 22:33:12 In other words most of  Canada is getting their oil from somewhere else which is a bloody disgrace
603 2018-06-05 22:33:11 I’m ready to work I think the oil field is calling my name
604 2018-06-05 22:32:59 This is an expensive week for my vehicle...oil change, new tires, wipers and lights. Plus I still need to do the compressor for my A/C...
605 2018-06-05 22:32:53 i almost mistook a bottle of oil as a bottle of water
606 2018-06-05 22:32:38 I bet it tastes like sesame seed oil and brisket
607 2018-06-05 22:32:35 Obama appointed Zinke. I don't believe President Trump would allow slaughter to continue IF he was made aware by someone as articulate, informed as you.  Why are 1970 laws not being enforced? I know PROTECT THE HARVEST is connected to Zinke and Lucas Oil and.

614 2018-06-05 22:31:48 It's oil. 
We should use it again.
615 2018-06-05 22:31:35 Hey @GlamLifeGuru what's your favorite essential/fragrance oil scent? I'm going to be making a bunch of necklaces with little vials of oil, and want to send you one with your favorite scent! I've always wanted to make something for you, and now I can!

620 2018-06-05 22:30:56 my mom is a hairdresser and my dad’s a mechanic yet I only know how to change my oil and what split ends are
621 2018-06-05 22:30:32 Where can I find this?
622 2018-06-05 22:30:27 What do you have for stronger drugs? Any triptans? Taking Advil with your Tylenol? Ice pack? Peppermint oil? Hope it goes away soon. My headache is definitely worse today, so I feel your pain. Gonna have to bust out the big girl drugs tonight too.
623 2018-06-05 22:30:25 Try factoring in the words US, oil and terminal decline. The current constraint for US fracking oil is transporting it to a refinery or terminal for export. Incidentally the STOS Maui business model went into terminal decline the moment they started extracting.
624 2018-06-05 22:30:18 how did we walk in and bum rush the whole middle east and for what oil, money, we got two religious factions fighting against each other, SHIITES AND SUUNIIS AND FOR WHAT MONEY , OIL, DINOSAUR, BLOOD, FOR OIL, OUR AMERICANS DYING FOR OIL HAS TO END THIS IS NOT AMERICAN!

626 2018-06-05 22:30:05 What about Puerto Rico? It’s more important than the south, because it’s considered as American  Island, plus we know yall thought about Venezuela,the same thoughts about Iraq back in 2003 and Libya in 2011, Syria 2011,and Egypt 2011 now how’s next?we don’t need gas or oil, peace

630 2018-06-05 22:29:30 No oil ... not interesting...
631 2018-06-05 22:29:24 My simple (and affordable) skin care : 

1. Toner = hidrosol + carrier oils + apple cider/rice vinegar + eo 

2. Serum = Argan oil + eo atau serum lokal seperti Sensatia & Pavettia 

3. Scrub = baking soda, coffee grounds or sea salt

637 2018-06-05 22:28:39 petrol from the two biggest oil companies (which now are one) i.e. ESSO and BP. 

If they are not selling any petrol, they will be inclined to reduce their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to follow suit. But to have an impact we need to reach

640 2018-06-05 22:28:30 I assume you guys are studying up on handling oil spills again since after your tax bill bribe, there are sure to be more of those.
641 2018-06-05 22:28:27 Creating water shortage is the next biggest business....
Bigger then oil !!!
All shortages and all.... it's just business !

And on the other hand, it is going towards direct war with the Creator... His world is ain't short of water !
642 2018-06-05 22:28:27 I wish I had coconut oil in my god I hate myself
643 2018-06-05 22:28:23 It does! But it's sooooo drying that it can actually cause make dandruff! If u need that refreshing feeling get some tea tree oil & put a few drops in ur shampoo

645 2018-06-05 22:28:09 I can’t stand waiting on oil changes man.
646 2018-06-05 22:27:42 I’ve heard about CBD oil. Never really needed it, but I will def look into that 
647 2018-06-05 22:27:40 @Green_roads  Purchased 1500mg oil early May. Email'd you on 5/16 & 5/29. *Crickets* I guess I won't order again. Must be nice to have an endless supply of customers so you don't have to bother providing any customer care to the people who have purchased your products.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

662 2018-06-05 22:25:22 yes floods are happening just recently in New Brunswick for instance but I am afraid since you keep approving projects that will emits emissions for decades like Kinder Morgan and BP to drill for oil off Nova Scotia these areas will have to get used to floods due 2 your decisions

664 2018-06-05 22:25:13 I guess the Paris Accord that Canada signed onto doesn't matter. Our global responsibility to reach our climate targets are NEVER going to happen with us being new owners of a rusty old pipeline and building more. Canada has been captured by oil industry.#cdnpoli #stopKM
665 2018-06-05 22:25:03 Went to pick up my dog Sarah's ashes. Had a tire blow out on freeway. I'm now at Big O getting all new tires. And a free oil change. 
666 2018-06-05 22:25:00 Now that the oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a litre is CHEAP, we need to take aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS - not sellers control the market place. With the price of petrol going up more each day,

670 2018-06-05 22:24:38 Boycott everything that is made by countries who kill Cetatians for oil and meat. They are contemptible and deserve to be treated the way they treat these beautiful sentient intelligent beings.
671 2018-06-05 22:24:38 The American people value clean, safe and healthy oceans over oil spills. Tell @repandyharrismd to #ProtectOurCoast during the #appropriations process this week, and support the Pingree amendment!
672 2018-06-05 22:24:35 10min beauty tip for all those who are fasting & not able to hydrate their skin :

Mix a spoon full of coffee, brown sugar, olive oil & a lil honey
Scrub your face gently
Leave it on for 10mins & wash off

Makes your skin as smooth as a baby's butt. 
673 2018-06-05 22:24:30 Good lord, fried in oil? Practically blasphemy!
674 2018-06-05 22:24:20 Did u use the primer with it. I heard it shrinks your pores to limit the amount of oil released so it’s not good for people with dry skin.
675 2018-06-05 22:24:03 Today was hard. But I’m forever thankful for OIL for bringing me the best people in my life.
676 2018-06-05 22:24:02 Pysyk is the only Oil King I have any time for.
677 2018-06-05 22:23:48 My shea moisture coconut oil turned into coconut butter because it’s been so hot 
678 2018-06-05 22:23:46 YES. So why are we building oil pipelines?

682 2018-06-05 22:22:44 Just need to reply with random answer

I'm sorry, but by law, I'm not allowed to do that in public

Are you sure? I've heard burlap really chafes

Unfortunately the health dept told us that hot oil isn't supposed to be applied at those temperatures.
683 2018-06-05 22:22:35 @WeeMissBea I bought some cbd oil after seeing it worked for you and it's so relaxing! Maybe I should of waited till I got home before trying it i was tempted to nap on a bench in the town centre
684 2018-06-05 22:22:22 At least wont spend time and $$$ on gas and oil change and smog check appointments any more. Just plug in at night, full in the morning, at a quarter or less of the cost of gas for the same distance driven.
685 2018-06-05 22:22:16 BC is a hotbed for earthquakes. 300 per year and the big one is overdue. An expanded tank farm will send thousands of barrels of dilbit down the mountain and cause untold human carnage. But Justin loves his oil and thats what matters. #cdnpoli #stopKM
686 2018-06-05 22:22:08 We are hitting £1.42 a litre in some areas now and soon we will be faced with paying £1.50 per litre. So here’s the idea:

This makes MUCH MORE SENSE than the 'don't buy petrol on a certain day campaign' that was going around last April or May! The oil companies just laughed

691 2018-06-05 22:21:24 No, that's not correct. US shale oil is a competitor to Saudi/OPEC oil, but is more expensive to extract (and supply is also constrained by US refining capacity). Zero relationship to your point that STOS would 'love' this new policy (they won't).
692 2018-06-05 22:21:19 I’ve been doing that too! CBD oil helps a bit but these vitamins helped even more!!!

702 2018-06-05 22:19:31 Zero scientific evidence that a vegan diet is heart healthy. A lot of reasons to believe otherwise. Hard to get adequate protein, and the only available fats (other than olive and coconut oil) are chock full of Omega 6. Terrible diet, nutritionally.
703 2018-06-05 22:19:29 Solor and wind will never be main power. You get cloudy days after day no power. Stail air no wind no power. You need coal and oil to make those things get going
704 2018-06-05 22:19:22 Hi, I’m always curious about meat eaters who are against soy? Do you also not eat animals that are fed soy? Because that’s the same thing. 70-80% of the worlds soy is fed to livestock. Soy is also used in frying oil, mayo, crackers, cakes, etc.
705 2018-06-05 22:19:19 Sometimes I use different essential oils in laundry to make clothes extra-clean or to bring different scents. My favorite is peppermint oil for leaving your clothes with a lasting sweet scent. Be careful, though, because it will fade colors.
706 2018-06-05 22:19:18 U need oil on your head at least to stop the sparks  . Them suppose just use condom or nylon comot this one
707 2018-06-05 22:19:10 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
708 2018-06-05 22:19:08 CBD Oil.  This is a special CBD strain.  Very pricey seeds.

710 2018-06-05 22:18:38 27% of all Norway's crude oil exports are to the UK. Guess what that makes?

712 2018-06-05 22:18:13 If we would have elected my dog instead of #oblamea and all he did was lick himself for 8yrs and not pile on regulations and shut down oil and coal all the other destructive things he did we would have recovered quicker.#Trump2020 #betonit #loveit

718 2018-06-05 22:17:00 SO OVER THE LAST 500 DAYS ONLY TWO NEWS STATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN HATING ON TRUMP OR REALLY REPORTING ON NEWS OTHER THAN DC BS, AND TWO SEC ON WORLD NEWS LIKE CHILDREN DYING OR LAND GRABS OR OIL OR HOMELESS NO JUST TEARING APART THE COUNRY EVERY DAY, AND TELLING US THEY KNOW BEST...
719 2018-06-05 22:16:59 Correct - now guess where the UK has been getting it's North Sea oil from for the last 40 years.
720 2018-06-05 22:16:51 With high oil prices and the west engaged in a rapidly growing trade war, just think about how much Putin is smiling right now. The U.S. is being torn apart with hatred & 1 of the 2 major parties is going along with treason with Russia.  Trump deserves a big bonus.
721 2018-06-05 22:16:51 I need new glasses & my oil change.
722 2018-06-05 22:16:50 1. Maybelline punya sih bagus betul.

723 2018-06-05 22:16:39 this should be an oil painting
724 2018-06-05 22:16:33 Nothing feels better than when a gen refuses to start and you clean a plug/add oil and it starts easily. 

Better than jollof rice.
725 2018-06-05 22:16:27 Got a haircut, washed and vacuumed my car, and received an oil/transmission fluid change.. like I’m ready.

728 2018-06-05 22:16:13 Not a VA issue but alternative medicine issue.  My son has a seizure disorder.  CBD oil did very little.  Medical MJ has probably dropped the number of seizures by half.
729 2018-06-05 22:16:10 Lmfao I laugh at people who think thats luxury cars are the only foreign cars ! I love my little hyundai  my little car gives me zero issues ! Oil changes& maintenance cheap as hell 
730 2018-06-05 22:15:58 girllll i feel it . i got my car in january i wasn’t supposed to need an oil change until november. i have 1500 miles until its time
731 2018-06-05 22:15:55 In the winter when it gets too dry, I have been know to pour olive oil on myself and massage it into my scalp and all over my body in a steamy shower.  My skin is restored an no longer itchy. Olive oil is fantastic!!!  You don't need anything else. #Truth #OliveOil #Healthy
732 2018-06-05 22:15:49 WASH YOUR BEDDING!!
- A lot of people don’t know how much oil and dirt stays on your sheets and pillowcases every night. Washing them regularly will reduce build up and hours of contact with the residue.
733 2018-06-05 22:15:29 My car is such a crybaby! I just got its oil changed 1yr ago now it wanna act all funny when i wanna go places... selfish little mazda. Now i gotta sit at jiffy lube for a whole like 20min...
734 2018-06-05 22:15:27 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
735 2018-06-05 22:14:46 A couple of my children have excess wax buildup. My doctor recommended a small medicine dropper and drop a few drops of oil in the ear, the wax will soften and make its way forward out of the ear naturally. My kids don't have tubes but have had their fair share of infections.

737 2018-06-05 22:14:32 I gotchu. Adding oil also prevents the water from boiling over.

739 2018-06-05 22:14:15 I'm disappointed with you

Your next question should have been, "which man of god's anointing oil did you use?"
740 2018-06-05 22:14:05 No, we're not the ones locked into a 70s timewarp. You know, TV repair chaps, oil from North Sea, Eurocentric trade. Oh, and racist immigration policies
741 2018-06-05 22:14:05 When I walk in your car dealership don’t try to start doing your job now I know you been sitting on yo ass for the past 3 hours, I’m not buying no car I’m just here for a oil change!

743 2018-06-05 22:13:43 People should understand oil production, pricing based on global supply / demand & refinery capacity & pricing. A growing economy means higher gas prices. Let refiners build more capacity & we’ll see lower pricing but that takes years & Obama killed those projects. #MAGA
744 2018-06-05 22:13:41 The look of discomfort on my Swedish editor’s face when she had to bring up the question of why my character was frying meatballs in oil instead of butter #dealbreaker
745 2018-06-05 22:13:27 Like you’ve always told me... you have to check the oil everyday
746 2018-06-05 22:13:22 the oil healed mine up in 2 weeks, I definitely recommend it! good luck
747 2018-06-05 22:13:20 Definitely!!!

751 2018-06-05 22:12:46 The Saudi's had the same attitude with regard to US oil reserves and the fracking boys, so you are in good company. Welcome to the real world where terminal decline is part and parcel of doing business.
752 2018-06-05 22:12:34 Need to buy coconut oil
753 2018-06-05 22:12:32 For the love of God, don’t tell them that some people say the dollars strength really exist because it’s de facto backed by oil. Not till they are older at least.

757 2018-06-05 22:12:23 But I remember some awesome kale/olive oil crisps. And oh my god that homemade bread #seriouslyyum

761 2018-06-05 22:11:43 Nutritious Egg Mask

1 egg
1 cup milk or plain yogurt
2 tbsp olive oil

Mix ingredients and apply for at least 15 minutes before washing out. Wash out with cold water, with hot water you risk cooking the egg in your hair.
762 2018-06-05 22:11:31 I have a gourmet popcorn maker and popcorn that cooks in coconut oil. He ain’t hearing nothing lmfao
763 2018-06-05 22:11:30 Man we gotta do something. Each of these mass garbage dumps need to be cleaned up now. There is no reason that there can't be a fleet of boats that can begin the extraction of this stuff before it gets dispersed or ground into microplastic. A response team like on an oil spill.
764 2018-06-05 22:11:27 He'll self destruct. Just another snake oil media hack. Go ahead, sell your snake oil, the Americans that count, know better than to buy it.
765 2018-06-05 22:11:09 @BretBaier.   I'm a vet and no longer watch the NFL since this controversial.  Sport should never have politics involved just like never talk religion in the job. Oil and vinegar doesn't mix.

768 2018-06-05 22:10:22 I stuck to my guns. When he zigged I zagged. Burned all of my midnight oil. Put baby in a corner then made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 

Nah seriously...he really wanted Thames...Herrera was just a throw in

Nigeria should let us go. We don't need Crude oil to survive. Just allow Biafra to exist the world should come and free Biafrans  from this demonic contraption called Nigeria. 

#FreeBiafra
779 2018-06-05 22:09:21 i often use the Plant Therapy organic basil essential oil under the arms - so much better smelling (and a 100% more healthy) than a typical deodorant
780 2018-06-05 22:09:19 The truth is we don’t know. But there are definitely things that can be done to reduce the risk exposure faced by developing countries rich in oil. One is to avoiding building up too many ‘carbon-linked assets’ above the ground if it can be avoided eg big NOCs, refineries, etc
781 2018-06-05 22:09:11 the key phrase is of course “if oil revenues when they come”. If the crude is ever traded it will be at least ten years time before any revenue is shared. As a responsible investor the UK should be appalled that Tullow is operating without a social licence and no governance
782 2018-06-05 22:08:47 Have you ever been to an essential oil class? It's approx. 30 to 45 mins and is filled with great information! From an intro class to info class there is information for everyone! I accepted a challenge that has me having 1 class for 8 weeks.... Will you help me? I can do Zoom
783 2018-06-05 22:08:27 First he lights a fuse on a cake debate, then it finally reaches the oil and now we’re probably gonna debate on what kind of cake we like. Ice cream all the way. Can’t stand that carrot stuff. May god help us all...
784 2018-06-05 22:08:25 That's indefensible, there are a million other possible residues which might contaminate the surfaces. Cigarette smoke, rancid oil from cooking, even a build up of cleaning products would be toxic if you licked the walls. Absolutely a moral panic
785 2018-06-05 22:08:25 Slide Bro .. My Wheel Situation All Bad Til Tomorrow, Need a Oil Change Bad lol
786 2018-06-05 22:08:14 supplying him with fuel for his war effort.  the Americans themselves were shipping oil and fuel to Japan right up to the moment Pearl was bombed.   so that had to change if the UK was going to stave off the attacks and
787 2018-06-05 22:08:02 Thieves essential oil works WONDERS!!!
788 2018-06-05 22:07:59 #pnpcbc I agree that there needs to be discussions and a presentation on how we are going to transition off oil. We need a plan not only to curtail ghg emissions but a plan that covers the implementation of alternate energy.
789 2018-06-05 22:07:58 Gee, sure seems like a better use of OUR Tax $ at home for National Security purposes than "unconstitutionally 'giving away' said Tax $ to Kurdish rebels abroad. 

Why aren't we LOANING the $ to Kurdish rebels sitting on TRILLIONS of oil?

Mere corruption. 

Private concessions.

798 2018-06-05 22:07:04 That top number seems to be a bit of a stretch for that....  dbag.  He was more into the oil than the country.

808 2018-06-05 22:06:07 now that we sued big oil out of court  we have plenty of money for tv commercials  just ignore that gas prices rose 60-80 cents a gallon.  No one will notice. we don't know what happened. look at my thumb gee your dumb
809 2018-06-05 22:05:54 Wow, you're probably a fat 10 year old sitting behind a chair all day eating McDonald's while his mom is getting beated up by his dad who was lucky enough to find oil, oh wait, you're from the UAE, so everything I just wrote is true :)

812 2018-06-05 22:05:41 Also given that oil and gas represents about 60%-65% of our extraction exports, I'm not sure how the loss of it would reduce our extraction by 81%?  Do the models imply we lose our metals mining as well in the crash?

814 2018-06-05 22:05:25 If you're going to use downstream emissions, you should also include downstream users, so it's a lot more than 33 million people that consume our energy.  We're a resource country.  We ship out a lot of coal, oil and gas.

817 2018-06-05 22:05:07 unlike the  country   where   i'm living   ,  where  the economy has  always been  based on   the  oil export and  all  the  priorities  have  been given    to this  sector, nevertheless we  are   still  waiting for an economy of  alternative  that  might  be  a  substitute .

827 2018-06-05 22:03:18 Listen here to hear Stuart Nash contradict the PM, not once, but thrice. I believe Nash; there was no Cabinet vote, and the oil and gas ban was a backroom jack-up.

857 2018-06-05 21:59:32 Other countries will abide and the US won’t. Typical entitled US behaviour- weaken an environmental or other agreement with oil lobby, then back out anyway and leave others with a watered down deal
858 2018-06-05 21:59:29 Just tried sugar,honey,olive oil,and a drop of vanilla extract. It works.

Drain, add olive oil, finely chopped rosemary, black pepper. Then mash or blend until desired consistency. Add more olive oil if too dry.
Good with sour dough.

P.S. I will only vote for conservatives that support President Trump, even if that means losing the house, and/or Senate. Get with the program, or fuck off. Thank you.

865 2018-06-05 21:58:21 It's not just about oil prices. It's a cocktail of different factors. Mostly, when you don't produce enough to warrant people looking for your currency to exchange for your goods, your currency value drops compared to other currencies
866 2018-06-05 21:58:16 Of course LVT will end land speculation, which is a good thing.  But what's to stop the rich just putting more of their money into oil paintings?

893 2018-06-05 21:55:09 Developers, oil extractors and miners work 7 days a week. If your an environmentalist, you better be working 8. That’s what drives me.

904 2018-06-05 21:52:41 There no evidence of a systemic problem in Canada. The oil price crashed twice in ten years from over $100 to under $40 per barrel, no cascade. This is all motivated reasoning.

913 2018-06-05 21:51:41 Alliances between countries are made base on interests,Iran and Russia would surely fight over d spoil of war in Syria,Iran and Russia are both living on oil,sanction on Iran is in Russia interest,Iran becoming a nuclear power would neutralize Russia influence in d middle east.
914 2018-06-05 21:51:38 @donttrythis Just watched MB cooking oil video on YouTube, and I have a question.  What do you think would happen economically if the world switched to cooking oil as a main energy source?

921 2018-06-05 21:50:56 Sadly, “if politics is a V10 engine, distribution of resources is the motor oil.“ Overcoming this curse and system is the direct route to retiring political traders and leaders that tell the people what they want to hear instead of giving the people what they need. Pure service!
922 2018-06-05 21:50:37 And with Trump we have improved w NK along w Russia, and all the Middle East oil countries The trumps met with during the election time period. He is worsening relations w Iran, Europe, Canada, Mexico, and many other of our allies.
923 2018-06-05 21:50:34 It may not help us but it might help what comes after us.. I figure since oil can run out in this life time start thinking of alternatives
924 2018-06-05 21:50:33 Oil slick?
925 2018-06-05 21:50:31 Dunning Kruger effect...on both sides usually but Trump's people are just straight out racists...more you know less you know but Trumps folks just dont care...they like the snake oil salesman because he isn't black or hillary.

927 2018-06-05 21:50:25 We can reduce plastic use, by not manufacturing it!!! Stop building pipelines & expanding the oil sands if you care about reducing wasteful end products?

935 2018-06-05 21:49:06 They’re both as anti-Muslim as you can get. I think India is smart enough not to fall completely head over heels for the Zionist trap considering they do export oil and petroleum from the Arab countries such as Qatar and Iran.

960 2018-06-05 21:45:52 Maybe you should wake up and look at the energy future for the world, and it is not nuclear or gas or oil. If you can’t see the future then you must be just plain stupid. I can live with arrogance but not with #NuclearWaste!

980 2018-06-05 21:42:16 My two favorite brands for cleansers are pacifica & yesto. I started using bio oil recently ish & love it!
981 2018-06-05 21:42:05 U should also investigate the oil industry that gets tremendous tax breaks to keep their profits at very high levels. No wonder solar, geothermal, wind, tides, etc., don't have a chance to be competitive. Hear Exxon will be coming out w/"USA gasmasks." Keep pumping CO2, (cough.)
982 2018-06-05 21:41:59 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
983 2018-06-05 21:41:58 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

986 2018-06-05 21:41:40 It takes a while for that to happen I’m all for the environment in fact I’m not a big fan of big oil but multiple cities rely on it
987 2018-06-05 21:41:37 Yet gas prices still climbing..... why? Likely due to recent law allowing export of US oil.... 
988 2018-06-05 21:41:32 It was only 'attempted murder' not something serious such as NFL code infractions nor piracy, barratry or mutinying upon an oil vessel upon the high seas. Sense of proportion!
989 2018-06-05 21:40:45 Nah, fam. Applying oil the process makes the sauce not stick to the noodle. Never break the pasta because you’re supposed to wrap the pasta around your fork. Just some things I learned from Food Network, lol. I love pasta

1005 2018-06-05 21:39:20 3 ...because of politics lately.

1006 2018-06-05 21:39:02 It was green and turned into oil
1007 2018-06-05 21:38:53 and he always had his hand out, took all sorts of goodies from lobbyists from the oil and gas industries
1008 2018-06-05 21:38:50 I wash it off first then use coconut oil to get the rest xx
1009 2018-06-05 21:38:49 I made chicken with butter and rice krispies for my family. Mine is plain with olive oil and sea salt. They get mashed potatoes and I get cauliflower mash. Salted with my tears.

1014 2018-06-05 21:38:08 I witnessed children getting on a oil field tank at long lake Texas I went to that tank and told Mr. Dent to put up a fence  and later in court to put up a fence 3 children got blowed up.
1015 2018-06-05 21:38:07 Jeanne I recently saw an episode of @howitsmadeup on @ScienceChannel and they How olive oil is made.  It was very interesting.

1019 2018-06-05 21:37:43 Oil drilling by Exxon or ONGC.. would be the perfect foil. Helping  assert their UNCLOS-mandated rights. Being ’s properties, they can be protected by lawful means.

Shifting focus to maritime rights is the correct posture. Wrong tools for the job so far.
1020 2018-06-05 21:37:39 Just curious, are you bullish oil today after this pullback. Thx.

1023 2018-06-05 21:37:02 You do realize this doesn't really show a plummet in investment in Canada right? It shows a spike in investment in the US....most likely associated with Shale Oil becoming accessible in the US
1024 2018-06-05 21:37:02 Dang man i just want me oil changed that’s it

1027 2018-06-05 21:36:55 If Trudeau handles it like the oil industry those steelworkers will have to be patient but I expect it to be solved quickly since we’re talking central Canada. If it involved bombardier it would be fixed in a couple of days.
1028 2018-06-05 21:36:36 How many snake oil flasks did he knock over rushing to it?
1029 2018-06-05 21:36:27 Its funny that Eric Holder is criticizing Trumps pardoning a extremely low level offender like Desousa who donated “crums” to a campaign yet Eric was the main Architect in the pardon of big felon Marc Rich who evaded $45 millin taxes and sold oil illeagaly to Iran!!!! #payforplay

1031 2018-06-05 21:36:26 It just gives everthing that perfect smokey flavour that ordinary olive oil dreams about...
1032 2018-06-05 21:36:20 This table that this guy shook is very,very big o.Somebody  said the way Kano girls love cars ehnn. You will think they were breastfed with engine oil.

1034 2018-06-05 21:35:48 My plug is a grower ,i love sippin oil
1035 2018-06-05 21:35:46 Currently I have photos, a mini lego figure (he holds my computer cable), a hand made Anderson shelter (school project in progress), lip balm and a bottle of neroli aromatherapy oil.  No clear desk policy tonight!
1036 2018-06-05 21:35:22 How can we call for help when all we have is a power drill, a microscope and fifteen bottles of olive oil?
1037 2018-06-05 21:35:17 Who cares it's full of rapeseed oil anyway, plenty of other healthier choices on the shelves these days.
1038 2018-06-05 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this June? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!
1039 2018-06-05 21:35:01 What? Canola oil? No way!
1040 2018-06-05 21:35:00 i bought new blankets & sheets yesterday , then lathered me & earl up in coconut oil after we showered , so now everything smells like coconuts 
1041 2018-06-05 21:34:50 I've watched too many people suffer from using bullshit quackery in place of actual science. Charlatans like you should be shelved along with every other purveyor of snake oil.
1042 2018-06-05 21:34:39 Well I hope all the Trumpsters are happy. To bad our #FAKEPRESIDENT does not care about you or me. He is nothing but a venomous snake oil salesman.
1043 2018-06-05 21:34:38 Imperialism, colonialism, genocide, terrorism, apartheid and the well-being of the military industrial complex and Big Oil are the legacy of the USA to date. 'Collateral damage' doesn't even get thoughts and prayers.
1044 2018-06-05 21:34:30 Michael Bay presents:"The Shape of Oil".  That poor girl will be ripped in half!!!
1045 2018-06-05 21:34:27 cover ya self in baby oil then scrub the oil off with an exfoliating mit, works a treat
1046 2018-06-05 21:34:24 No, it's PG, PEG200 and PEG400.  All chemicals.  MCT oil works perfectly, no gross taste or burning.
1047 2018-06-05 21:34:05 Why does every politician start with”we know that” if you did the pipeline would be 1/2 built.  You do “know that” your dealing with a PM that has no intention of building a pipeline. He hates Oil but he hates the West MORE!
1048 2018-06-05 21:34:00 Teams that absoultely want him and can afford it, can expect the 80-90 million over 7 years.

If the Oil didn't have 8.5 locked in on Draisitil (and some other poor contracts) would you throw 9-10 million at him to be on a team with McDavid and have a 1a & 1b centreman?
1049 2018-06-05 21:33:43 I would just go to autzone if they had my specific gs-r oil pan :/ and yeaa all it took was one good pot hole and it hurt the poor teggy

1051 2018-06-05 21:33:18 They make it with horrible, nasty-tasting rapeseed oil now (as with Heinz Mayonnaise, Hellmans, etc) so as far as I am concerned it is inedible.
1052 2018-06-05 21:33:08 This stuff tastes gross.  I use MCT Oil.  32 oz for $20 vs your 15ml for $20.
1053 2018-06-05 21:33:07 I was 17 - weekend job (bakery counter) at a large Tesco on the London/Brighton cycle route - store donated items for the local refreshment stop - 4am start for me - made, proved, fried, jammed and sugared 12,000 doughnuts in 16 hours - stank of deep fried oil for several days.
1054 2018-06-05 21:33:05 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
1055 2018-06-05 21:32:08 Probably two-stroke, not diesel. And that would mean 100% it was burning oil, which would be mixed into the gasoline at probably a 20:1 ratio.

(I had a two-stroke dirt bike for one glorious summer when I was 8.)
1056 2018-06-05 21:32:08 It’s more the skin underneath than the beard that itches. Beard oil and balm.
1057 2018-06-05 21:31:55 Lol getting an oil change and just watched this guy try to get in my car without moving my seat back
1058 2018-06-05 21:31:53 Well @DaveMyFace it's seems your lot are swallowing bottles of green ideology pills at the cost of tax payers, the poor and the environment and its creatures for the profit of local snake oil salesmen and overseas owned entities.......
1059 2018-06-05 21:31:51 18.3 million is probably like 4 miles of road, thanks Deb.

Our fuel taxes are already batshit crazy.
How about some relief?

OR, your pal Donny could negotiate us some stellar deals on oil. #AlwaysWinning
1060 2018-06-05 21:31:33 deadass need me a car that runs on vegetable oil
1061 2018-06-05 21:31:22 I havn't heard Lynyrd Skynyrd in months.  It must be time to get my oil changed.
1062 2018-06-05 21:31:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however illegal immigration.
1063 2018-06-05 21:31:06 Thanks so much, finishing a few oil painting is one of my goals for the summer
1064 2018-06-05 21:30:55 The stupid is your sir!  Your hurting us by bringing us inflation, higher costs for everything because the world becomes less competitive.  Your hurting our friends and allies in favor of Russia, Saudi Arabia and others.  You get rid of the EPA to drive up costs for oil.
1065 2018-06-05 21:30:55 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1066 2018-06-05 21:30:39 In 2015, trade between Spain and Venezuela totaled €1.1 billion Euros. Spanish exports to Venezuela include: food, automobile parts and electronic equipment. Venezuelan exports to Spain include: oil, fish, aluminum, chemical based products, iron and cacao. @Wikipedia
1067 2018-06-05 21:30:23 Got to get some of my beard oil to @Jeezy asap.

1071 2018-06-05 21:30:09 Madness that is a man who calls himself a minister from the Niger Delta sitting down there in abuja watching the north use our oil money to develop the north buy fighter jets no federal present even in his state rivers
1072 2018-06-05 21:30:04 Lavender essential oil is a natural sedative. It promotes relaxation in your nervous system. At times when you feel stressed or your conf...
1073 2018-06-05 21:30:03 Then I'm sure you know about the dangers of aluminium, and the benefits of coconut oil.
1074 2018-06-05 21:30:01 Stop stealing their natural resources and see how long it takes your havens to unravel. Leave the oil in the ME. The Colbat in the DRC. The Platinum in SA. Your economies would crumble. You missed the genius gene. You clearly lack the IQ you keep mentioning
1075 2018-06-05 21:29:56 I have very hard time to imagine the scenario under which crude oil won't pop some 10-15 bucks by autumn... I'll keep trying seriously!
1076 2018-06-05 21:29:42 The pores on my nose are never not producing more oil chill damn
1077 2018-06-05 21:29:33 Venezuela's people elected Maduro. Twice. The crisis is manufactured by the #USA because #Venezuela has some oil reserves and no connection to IMF. #HandsOffVenezuela
1078 2018-06-05 21:29:32 LADIES - is it alright to remove make up with coconut oil?

1080 2018-06-05 21:29:24 Lol the oil was drying up fast and shit
1081 2018-06-05 21:29:19 Another great option to add moisture and nutrients is to get fish oil to add to dry food. If it's concentrated u can still add extra water too, however moistened/soggy dry food shouldn't be left out all the time, pickup and toss leftovers within a few hours.
1082 2018-06-05 21:29:11 And U.K has a fair chunk of Europe's Oil reserves
So what's going on
U.K got European regeneration Grants
So what's going on
Trident and Infra for London and the S/E
that's what's going on
1083 2018-06-05 21:29:06 Oil policy comes first (of course)... Until three weeks ago, it was clear that the June 22 meeting was just to robber stamp the extension... (they were looking for CAPEX supportive conditions). Now, i am puzzled. Anyway, if the Platts VZ news comes true... All that is worthless..
1084 2018-06-05 21:29:00 The American people value clean, safe and healthy oceans over oil spills. Urge @repscotttaylor to #ProtectOurCoast during the #appropriations process this week, and support the Pingree amendment!
1085 2018-06-05 21:28:40 Turns out motor oil makes my hair look awesome
1086 2018-06-05 21:28:35 He’s undoing years of progress and rolling back a ton of regulations so businesses and particularly oil and coal companies can make more money. As long as that continues they will keep turning a blind eye.
1087 2018-06-05 21:28:24 It is time we study the Endocannabinoid System and addiction. It is illogical that less than 14% of Medical professionals are aware of this biological system.The information does exist, one just needs to know where to look for it. Imagine if a little Cannabis oil helps withdrawal
1088 2018-06-05 21:28:17 Damn $65 for an oil change...
1089 2018-06-05 21:28:13 So the oil companies are just gouging us Americans with these high summer gas prices
1090 2018-06-05 21:28:08 Not just that. Another aspect of the global socialist/communist establishment that goes by feminism. But Saudi oil money is a factor too.
1091 2018-06-05 21:27:44 My car is simultaneously telling me that I am due for an oil change and need fuel. Is this how it feels to have teenagers?
1092 2018-06-05 21:27:40 Get some jars of sausages in oil before you leave.
And some 'nduja.
And some soppressatas.
1093 2018-06-05 21:27:35 Similarly, it is difficult to discern the economic implications caused by the blockade, from those caused by decreasing oil prices and a general downturn in the GCC.

1105 2018-06-05 21:25:32 Do you mean coconut *cream*? (Which I like now and then in coffee) as I can’t ever imagine coconut *oil* as ever making a ‘dollop’. It’s more a ‘lump’

1108 2018-06-05 21:25:18 I agree. Unless some oil soaked middle Eastern potentate with a hankering for a vanity project and a bottomless pit of a wallet wants to buy us promotion and then the Premier League and then build a dynasty.
1109 2018-06-05 21:24:59 想像が容易くてめちゃくちゃ笑った
1110 2018-06-05 21:24:53 why do people really think our “freedom” is still at risk. it’s not. we’re in someone else’s business & fighting over oil. the only reason “freedom” would be at risk is if we’re destroying other countries. oh wait......
1111 2018-06-05 21:24:52 On top of that Rohde Island gets two reps even though everyone in the state lives in an area smaller than my county, but the guy that reps me in the mountains with Forest Fires also represents the oil refineries 700 miles away in the plains. We don't have the same issues

1120 2018-06-05 21:23:35 This just reminded me, when I stopped eating nuts for @SBakerMD 90 day carnivore trial, I felt so much better that I have never gone back to eating them , mainly cashews and madaemias) I wonder if it is the PUFA's in them... any way, I still cook with Macademia oil at times.
1121 2018-06-05 21:23:31 Sometimes I think that there's nothing a little weed oil and a glass of wine won't cure, but then I remember what pain has planted in me.

1123 2018-06-05 21:23:03 Think about it from KSA's perspective. What's more important - an oil policy that helps Saudi Arabia's strategic & domestic objectives or returning a favor to a friend who was going to do that thing you wanted anyway? KSA may yet increase production but it won't be bc of Trump
1124 2018-06-05 21:22:53 When are you going to delete this proven (by the Sun) falsehood? You’re a charlatan and a snake oil salesman, and if Jesus did exist, you’d be top of his naughty list.

1126 2018-06-05 21:22:49 Fuel increase comes at no surprise I mean the G.O politics between US and N.Korea, Tariffs on SA steel, trade war threats, Stronger Dollar v Rand, Agriculture & Mining worst performance this year and Oil Prices keeps on rising.

1128 2018-06-05 21:22:39 Venezuela happened because they built all their social programs on the hope that oil prices would stay high. The US has a much more diversified economy.
1129 2018-06-05 21:22:32 Guys you have been consuming fake products esp corn oil and sugar
1130 2018-06-05 21:22:21 "Mary took a liter of perfumed oil made from aromatic nard and anointed the feet of Jesus* and dried them with her hair; the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil." Hearing this at 13, my understanding of Jesus' life and mine, and of what could be holy, were transformed.

1133 2018-06-05 21:21:57 I sent a donation for four trees. My heart is broken over this travesty. Palm oil must be banned. We don’t need it in our food. Palm oil causes obesity, cancer, and destroys our environment. Share with your friends-no palm oil.
1134 2018-06-05 21:21:56 Jadi kemaren ceritanya, aku nyoba pake 5 steps skin care korea2 gt. Oil make up remover, cleanser, toner, essence, moisturizer dan emg enak bgt kulit skrg. Tapi w nyobanya pake sample. Dan bakal nyoba pake share in jar. Karna masih nyoba smp bnr2 cocok

1136 2018-06-05 21:21:36 Now, my question to d director of nnpc above statement is. Who is Nigeria. Him or we d citizens. If u say it's a body established to manage d commercial interests of Nigeria oil & gas sector.Does it also mean we do not have right 2 know what goes on in nnpc?

1149 2018-06-05 21:18:48 Got to figure out a joke that connects chicken-frying oil to petroleum
1150 2018-06-05 21:18:26 CBD oil helps
1151 2018-06-05 21:18:16 Ima start doing my own oil changes too. Haven’t done one in awhile. Ima skip this one tho ha.
1152 2018-06-05 21:18:15 Don’t worry- just as the paradigm shifted when oil came into common usage, it’s shifting again towards renewables. Wind, solar, hydro, power storage etc all continue to gain ground. 

That’s exactly why we’re seeing this Big tobacco-style smear campaign. Poor Big Oil is afraid!

1155 2018-06-05 21:17:54 In the middle of a Castor Oil detox and my toilet is broke. Can someone come over and fix my flapper?
1156 2018-06-05 21:17:47 All skins need moisturizer, even acne-prone ones. Without moisturizer, the skin tightens up, and the sebaceous glands go into overtime producing oil. Tightness narrows the pores, so oil can't escape, causing comedones (acne, blackheads, whiteheads).
1157 2018-06-05 21:17:32 Tea tree oil is evil
1158 2018-06-05 21:17:25 yes yes! I found myself constantly taking aleve, advil, tylenol, etc until Kelly started getting the cbd oil rollers and other types that would help relieve any tension so much

1163 2018-06-05 21:16:30 It is a body established by the law to manage the commercial interests of Nigeria in the oil and gas sector and conduct trade therein. It cannot therefore by any stretch of imagination be brought within the definition of public institution under the act.NNPC

1166 2018-06-05 21:16:02 $7 B from the Child Health Insurance Program. Remember when politicians took money from Social Security then years later complained it wasn't supportable? Hello CHIP.
Then there's $4.3 B to develop more fuel efficient cars. You want to maintain has guzzlers to support big oil.
1167 2018-06-05 21:15:58 Today one of our tweeters (@SciEdResearcher) was getting her oil changed while wearing her Tuscaloosa Dems t-shirt and an “I voted sticker” and one of the employees asked how he could get his voting rights restored! Voting changes lives in so many ways.

1172 2018-06-05 21:15:23 Yeah it's sad that our elected officials wage deadly wars in the name of oil and gold. Perhaps we should put a stop to that. Then maybe millions more won't have to be killed because of the greed and prejudice of our leaders.

1180 2018-06-05 21:14:23 My coworkers take this job entirely too serious. They don’t pay me enough to argue with these ppl. Take your free oil change and go.

1210 2018-06-05 21:11:36 I spelt it wrong. It’s aioli. Garlic, olive oil and mustard. Sooooo good if you find a nice one.
1211 2018-06-05 21:11:17 This doesn't work for me o, abi it's the pepper that is plenty. I even switched to palm oil sef.
1212 2018-06-05 21:11:09 4 hour wait to get an oil change 
1213 2018-06-05 21:11:06 Gonna get up early Thursday morning and get my oil changed and air in my tires. At least I don't have to work lol
1214 2018-06-05 21:10:53 You try to call out hypocrisy among oil users who also want change before it’s too late, yet you’ve made changes to your equipment/infrastructure to account for climate change’s effects, all while peddling pro-oil disinfo, greenwashing, and propaganda. Who’s the bigger hypocrite?
1215 2018-06-05 21:10:53 Are the oil industry workers on strike? Is the bazaar on strike? Are car workers on strike? Are steel workers on strike? If all of these were, I would agree there is a crisis. It is easy to look on the situation from outside and make it into something bigger than it really is.
1216 2018-06-05 21:10:53 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1217 2018-06-05 21:10:50 In summary my brother, very soon no one will need our oil, and our economy will crash. If we continue to wait to get our polity right first, the economic upheaval coming will crush it anyway.
1218 2018-06-05 21:10:48 Strong close in #crude oil. I'm in here since beginning of April with TZ at around 77 to 81. Hope to get this done. Even though May came up as a rev month. Hope to load on another position briefly. June needs to end up green. I hope the best & expect the worst #trading
1219 2018-06-05 21:10:27 I don’t deserve my Gonga. She took my car to get an oil change, paid for it and filled my tank before she brought it back to me. And she didn’t have to. 
1220 2018-06-05 21:10:27 Weed oil to be precise.
1221 2018-06-05 21:10:25 It seems that once people experience the benefits of CBD oil first hand they become true converts.  They start ditching prescriptions and keep ordering their oil.  Strong support from seniors as well.
1222 2018-06-05 21:10:25 No, none of what I listed were accomplished by Obama, except maybe promoting renewable energy, but it wasn't target at coal and oil workers. Were you paying attention at all to the policies and laws that were passed during the last administration?
1223 2018-06-05 21:10:21 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
1224 2018-06-05 21:10:18 Totally understand. Using natural products has help me so much. Aloe Vera gel, rose oil & tea tree oil are the magic Daily combo. With a bentonite clay mask here and there and you’ll be set

1228 2018-06-05 21:10:00 Whales and dolphins need our protection from more oil spills. Tell Congress and @mariodb to #ProtectOurCoast, and oppose new offshore drilling during the #appropriations process!
1229 2018-06-05 21:09:58 Do a smell test, and see if it smells rancid at all. But it’s a natural oil so rarely will it go bad, just may be a different consistency and the oil has lost its benefits probably. If no smell, do a skin patch test. If nothing then you’re fine to use
1230 2018-06-05 21:09:42 Why am I always nervous going to the shop to get my oil changed 
1231 2018-06-05 21:09:28 Did a hot oil treatment, cardio, and abs whilst watching love Island. We love a multi tasking queen
1232 2018-06-05 21:09:16 Yes,oil and gass supply shut down
1233 2018-06-05 21:09:13 Yet the article says that the oil price rebound was behind the increase. Hmmmm... 
FYI, we're not your enemy, and you started your foolish argument. Mute away!

After studying the numbers of Venezuela production & exports patterns + having decent information regading their situation, I believe: a) they the govt is lying about it ouf of embarassment b) it's going to get significantly worse over the next 1yr
1239 2018-06-05 21:08:43 How disingenuous of you. Of course oil provided the fuel for massive advances, and its use is near unavoidable today. It also came with a huge cost which science has been sounding the alarm about for decades, which you’d rather us ignore for your continued profit.
1240 2018-06-05 21:08:39 The cannabis oil was just an eye dropper full. You can barely taste it but, its feeling pretty good right now!  XD

1242 2018-06-05 21:08:35 Record high fuel prices in the midst of a years long slump in oil prices are totally unjustified.

1245 2018-06-05 21:07:59 Coconut oil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic medicinal practice that dates back over 3,000 years. It’s a process where you swish a small amount of coconut oil around in your mouth in order to kill unfriendly bacteria, keeping your whole mouth clean and fresh.
1246 2018-06-05 21:07:50 Salad Cream is being renamed Sandwich Cream...what is happening?! Marathons, Opal Fruits, Oil of Ulay and Jif...now this #changeisnotalwaysbetter #heinz
1247 2018-06-05 21:07:47 Those saying anything akin to not being a member whilst retaining full access or not having to keep all obligations whilst maintaining full access is clearly wrong & selling snake oil; anyone peddling keeping single market for say goods only is at best flying a hopeful kite
1248 2018-06-05 21:07:33 Don’t understand why all these green warriors want to save the value for investors in oil & gas stocks. They can look after themselves. Unless there’s some other motive .....
1249 2018-06-05 21:07:28 How much oil did you add? Asking for myself.
1250 2018-06-05 21:07:14 a lie!! but the sectret is im on green tea and iced coffee and a lot of almond oil shister!!
1251 2018-06-05 21:07:10 coconut oil will help the pain and scabbing!!!!
1252 2018-06-05 21:07:04 Toasted sourdough bread with garlic, olive oil, sliced heirloom tomato, and coarse sea salt is so heavenly
1253 2018-06-05 21:07:01 We are when oil is involved lmao..
1254 2018-06-05 21:06:59 Bruce Willis also fires a shotgun aboard an oil rig. Because apparently, risk of explosion isn't a thing in this universe.
1255 2018-06-05 21:06:47 Publishing a response doesn't make the response valid. And since you still cannot provide any convincing evidence for efficacy, homeopathy continues to be snake oil.
1256 2018-06-05 21:06:43 Shoulda let some Oil Drip On That Dry ass Scalp
1257 2018-06-05 21:06:42 Minus the oil. Excellent!
1258 2018-06-05 21:06:38 Baby oil hey
1259 2018-06-05 21:06:33 AKU PAKE KAK NEBE!! ky oil gituuu!! Aku pake yang grapeseed oil, so far aku suka sihhhh bagus kakk
1260 2018-06-05 21:06:30 i just use vegetable oil. Every now and then, i use kosher salt to give em a good cleaning and then bake the pans in a 350 oven for an hour to keep em shiny and clean!
1261 2018-06-05 21:06:20 I'd rather take a knife to my eye than to have voted for the Con and  whatever this "winning" is. It's called ability to judge character and having some semblance of decency to know not to vote for that snake oil salesman. Wake up, man. He's a lying grifter!
1262 2018-06-05 21:06:16 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames. 
Bye spiders!
1263 2018-06-05 21:06:11 Our country is being run by a realty show snake oil salesman. I get that it’s amusing but the danger to the world cannot be overlooked.
1264 2018-06-05 21:05:59 I’m not the biggest fan for tan either but for some reason the whole thing go. Get the tuna in sunflower oil one mix well
1265 2018-06-05 21:05:42 Problem with petrol is that oil enters the country via deep water ports. Only 6 in the UK. If it cannot get in due to the backlog of ships waiting to deliver, then we will run short of petrol. Most of our non-EU imports clear customs in Rotterdam which is in the EU.
1266 2018-06-05 21:05:38 This sounds awesome! Any clue where I can get some jojoba oil from?
1267 2018-06-05 21:05:36 Is God Tema oil refinery or He's GAPOHA. If you've given your life to God what He will give you is way bigger than a job. He will give you eternal life
1268 2018-06-05 21:05:33 I started taking multi vitamins with fish oil. I feel more energy throughout the day. The weed mellows me out so it’s a win win
1269 2018-06-05 21:05:25 Nationalized in 1976 by Pres Carlos Perez & control transfered under PDVSA which in 2002 backed by foreign oil companies attempted to overthrow #HugoChavez instigated by the @CIA. Where there's oil & other resources the US needs the CIA is there @NicolasMaduro needs your help
1270 2018-06-05 21:05:07 Trying out a new hair oil which I feel smells like ant killer. On a positive note I’ve spilt quite a bit of it on my bed so the smell won’t be leaving me anytime soon.
1271 2018-06-05 21:05:00 My essentials are grass fed beef, wild-caught salmon, sugar-free bacon (I don't eat bacon that often though), eggs, avocado, frozen blueberries and strawberries for occasional eating, avocado oil mayo (not exactly cheaply priced but hey), WATER, vegetables, clarified butter -
1272 2018-06-05 21:05:00 Africa may have oil and diamonds but the Americas truly have beautiful landscapes and greenery.
1273 2018-06-05 21:04:58 It wouldn't have made a difference if Kenyans knew that oil has been discovered in Kenya or not. We will still buy fuel at global prices it's as if nothing ever happened.
1274 2018-06-05 21:04:58 Incorrectly assumed Canada wb more environmentally responsible than US but Keurigs everywhere & palm oil in maple candies & cookies  very disappointing
1275 2018-06-05 21:04:53 Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
And a grindstone to your nose
1276 2018-06-05 21:04:43 No oil drips.........yet #harleys
1277 2018-06-05 21:04:40 Just go use my Shea butter and oil literally in the container. June barely start wey this heat gine?
1278 2018-06-05 21:04:38 An oil fund
1279 2018-06-05 21:04:36 White, brown is too fine. The consistency I like is super chunky like no loose oil
1280 2018-06-05 21:04:32 claim linked back to he Nursing Mother’s Herbal, p115,p130 (see grey box on teas), p134 on oversupply treatments where she cites Lisa Marasco. DM me if you want pictures of pages from the book. To clarify, the book claims peppermint oil not teas are effective "antigalactagogues"
1281 2018-06-05 21:04:20 Whats he been putting on his heed like cooking oil ?
1282 2018-06-05 21:04:18 @Ford Ford, I have just left the A Ford Dealership in Chandler, Az and was kicked out and did not to return, for giving a Bad Survey due to the lack of service provided during the initial sale of a 2018 Ford Focus and was only trying to get a promised oil change from the salesman
1283 2018-06-05 21:04:01 Wow & literally  months before cars can drive themselves,a  truly progressive move forced on the Saud family by a failing economy & a crappy oil price.
 Why am I not rejoicing?
1284 2018-06-05 21:03:48 First we lost Marathons, then they attacked Opal Fruits. Jif became Cif, Oil of Ulay became Olay. We didn’t like it but we accepted it. But messing w/our Salad Cream is just a step too far! Please, leave it alone. I eat it on my salad! @KraftHeinzCo #SaladCream #notsandwichcream
1285 2018-06-05 21:03:34 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
1286 2018-06-05 21:03:31 Just to note, your brain requires oil to function properly. Most oils are acidic. Life is a balance, so is diet. Keep it real...
1287 2018-06-05 21:03:10 To one of the questions I found two answers.
1. Kirkuk is swapping crude oil for nat gas from Iran.
2. Crude oil from Kirkuk will be refined in Tehran. The same quantity of oil will then be shipped to Iraq's southern port.
1288 2018-06-05 21:02:47 Just sugar and coco oil
1289 2018-06-05 21:02:46 start your avocation as a chef in this fashion
learn how to make a scratch salad dressing (oil onion citrus or bacon drip)
then work on simple sauces (puttanesca or anything red)
these are simple 
now make a decent soup stock from old veggies or last night’s chicken or beef 
1290 2018-06-05 21:02:44 And yet Canada got drawn in.. 
trade between us ... since we are a small population compared to you
US drools over our lumber as we got it by the forestful.. pisses trump off 
Oil US basically owns our oil. They take it, refine it, sell it back to us at a premium
1291 2018-06-05 21:02:39 Too much:  Unfortunately, we eat way too much omega-6, which is found in the corn oil and vegetable oils used in so much American food. Too much omega 6 can raise your blood pressure, lead to blood clots that can cause heart attack and stroke, and cause your body to retain water.
1292 2018-06-05 21:02:36 Melissa 
"got stung by bee  Put our cbd oil on it and wham pain gone swelling gone. Love my oil. "
1293 2018-06-05 21:02:35 Oh I bet it's all about the price of oil and it's "Harper's Fault "
1294 2018-06-05 21:02:25 #africa oil
1295 2018-06-05 21:02:21 Haven’t conservatives already made enemies of everything except oil wells, tax havens, and racism?
1296 2018-06-05 21:02:09 Sayings some Yorkshire dialect. Coil = Coal.
 ‘oil = Hole.
 Coil ‘oil = Coal Cellar or Coal Mine.
 Roo-ad = Road.
 Soo-ap = Soap (and possibly also Soup).
 Coo-at = Coat. But also, Coit = Coat.
 Boo-at = Boat.
 Boo-it = Boot.
1297 2018-06-05 21:02:09 The oil is so good with them too. And so vibrant green which looks awesome.
1298 2018-06-05 21:01:52 The way some of this girls love cars, you will think they're breastfeed with engine oil.
1299 2018-06-05 21:01:37 I made some lower fat brownies today with applesauce and like a little bit of oil plus egg whites .
1300 2018-06-05 21:01:37 clover is staring at my giant bottle of olive oil like someone stares at a hot person
1301 2018-06-05 21:01:35 Here's an easy way to cheat, take a glass dish, put broccoli it, pour olive oil on top and kinda coat them, a little salt, a little pepper, a little Italian seasoning, and bake until soft
1302 2018-06-05 21:01:26 3/11 They knew how to properly oil their legs and use scotch tape to give themselves more cleavage, all the tricks. This was new to me. It felt like a cultural experience where this was not where I was from and the customs were all strange but fascinating. @MissAmericaOrg
1303 2018-06-05 21:01:20 This dude legit got mad at me because he wanted synthetic oil top off for free on a car with an Oil Can Henry's sticker
1304 2018-06-05 21:01:15 Leaking oil?!?!
1305 2018-06-05 21:01:00 Congress needs to #ProtectOurCoast from offshore drilling and oil spills. RT to urge @tomrooney to oppose new offshore drilling during the #appropriations process!
1306 2018-06-05 21:00:50 @Art_Case have you ever encountered a case of an oil painting on both sides of a single canvas? I’m looking to see what can be done to stop the degradation of the image. Thanks!
1307 2018-06-05 21:00:39 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
1308 2018-06-05 21:00:36 ohhhh okay, cool. my hair was unbearable when it was longer without layers lol. also castor oil helps with hair growth if you want to speed up the process!
1309 2018-06-05 21:00:35 Depression... Cook some spaghetti, add cream (the one used to eat canned peaches with) instead of tomato sauce, parsley, olive oil, anything else you'd like, eat it, and bye depression.
1310 2018-06-05 21:00:33 Basically garlic and oil, you’ll of had it before abroad they always have it on tables and stuff, and in stores and stuff  reyt nice to dip bread in and that
1311 2018-06-05 21:00:29 One of the state's iconic oil rigs in the ocean is being dismantled. But the fight against offshore drilling continues ...
1312 2018-06-05 21:00:13 borage oil? 'scusee whilst I google...
1313 2018-06-05 21:00:04 June 05, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1314 2018-06-05 20:59:58 Oil! What oil? You Cookin?
1315 2018-06-05 20:59:55 Maybe. Maybe not. It’s all still snake oil until they define it further.
1316 2018-06-05 20:59:44 Made my sister drive to the oil change place because I hate driving over that big gap in the floor 
1317 2018-06-05 20:59:36 Your mouth is way too dirty for a dumb bird! I'm going to fry you in oil! When your real owner comes to get you I'm going to kill them!
1318 2018-06-05 20:59:32 Longest oil change EVER @AcuraCanada 
1319 2018-06-05 20:59:19 Whole food plant based (e.g., Nutritarian) excludes sugar, oil, salt, processed foods, etc.. Limits starches. "Vegan" term carries the baggage of "animal rights" and "green" politics, with which I disagree.

Nutritarian gave me much better results than paleo/keto.
1320 2018-06-05 20:59:10 First was the dinosaurs,then a meteorite killed em and they turned to oil, a few wars and Elvis died! Oh and wolves are now a super power and @tim_spiers_Star and Orville the duck have never been seen in the same room together! Pretty much covers it!
1321 2018-06-05 20:59:00 A single Arctic oil spill would coat vast areas, devastate wildlife and Native ways of life. We need to support the Pingree amendment to #ProtectOurCoast
1322 2018-06-05 20:59:00 .@andyharrisMD: Our oceans are a public resource meant for fishing, tourism and recreation, not oil spills. Support the Pingree amendment in Wednesday’s #appropriations markup! #ProtectOurCoast
1323 2018-06-05 20:58:59 I have a question: would it possible that once it is developed (and sold back to whoever), that the US decide to put tariffs on Canadian oil export due to the fact that Canada's govt has helped building it? Anything that looks like intervention is considered as help by US now.
1324 2018-06-05 20:58:30 Must Choose one: who would you let put suntan oil on you at the beach, Dave, Adam, or Heath? #fantasymail that is equivalent to my pick up choice of Rawls, Jalen Richard, or Gillislee
1325 2018-06-05 20:58:28 I gave my girlfriend a massage using coconut oil. Not only did it cure her depression, but we no longer need to pick up any Plan B!
1326 2018-06-05 20:58:22 I’m kinda glad I didn’t get the jdm b18c tho cause I just cracked my oil pan and finding a b18c1 oilpan for my motor was such a pain in the ass I couldn’t imagine a genuine B18c
1327 2018-06-05 20:58:13 He must really hate his wife. He got his mistress a job working at the EPA, scoring big bucks and she didn't even have to show up for work! Meanwhile, his wife's slaving over the hot peanut oil fryer...
1328 2018-06-05 20:58:10 None! How much have you given away to oil, pharmaceuticals, your own family. You really are pulling the biggest scam in US history.
1329 2018-06-05 20:58:07 @osmo_uk I topped up old osmo floor finish with 1 thin coat. Would your wax cleaner and a buffer be a good idea to make it a little shinier, or damage new oil coat? Thanks
1330 2018-06-05 20:57:59 Better idea: give Flint clean water, help homeless veterans, stop invading sovereign oil rich nations, give free healthcare & tell the truth
1331 2018-06-05 20:57:50 Take some oregano oil in a veggie capsule. Kicks it quick!
1332 2018-06-05 20:57:49 Chilled lavender oil mixed with a scent free hypoallergenic cream from fridge after bicarb of soda bath. Then swap suncream in future. You need hypoallergenic uva and uvb protection good luck
1333 2018-06-05 20:57:49 たまんねぇ……
1334 2018-06-05 20:57:44 Vitamin E oil shawty

1336 2018-06-05 20:57:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1337 2018-06-05 20:57:29 How can a journalist be a thread to a country like Egypt? When the real enemy is basking in sand dunes of Sinai terrorising Egyptians and others taking oil for weapons.
1338 2018-06-05 20:57:27 My brother put the wrong weight oil in a car I gave him and the engine cratered within 3 weeks.
1339 2018-06-05 20:57:26 Coconut oil a few hours before washing once a week is a great conditioning treatment. Also get dead ends trimmed, each person is different for how often a good hair dresser will help you, I go every 6 months and only get 1/4 inch taken off.
1340 2018-06-05 20:57:15 Baby oil and a good time? What kind of shit are y’all selling here?
1341 2018-06-05 20:57:07 Cont: Syria - no need to explain...
Iraq - no need to explain
Iran - bad economy, additional sanctions on the way
Yemen - third world country with bad economy, civil war etc
Lybia - Who really know what happens there...
Only the Golf countries are better because not oil and gas.
1342 2018-06-05 20:56:50 The working class credibility of the Nellists is not in doubt abandon salad cream and enjoy mayonnaise ...drissle oil slowly.....
1343 2018-06-05 20:56:32 Also the UAE has ripped America off for oil for decades. Really think they would help people without ripping them off, Again? I wish someone could develop free energy & put these crooks out of business.
1344 2018-06-05 20:56:29 does anyone know if jamaican castor oil really makes your eyelashes longer and fuller or is that just bs  help
1345 2018-06-05 20:55:44 Sing a patriotic song with Donald!

1346 2018-06-05 20:55:43 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
1347 2018-06-05 20:55:43 Using bucket brigades to transport oil
Just think of all the jobs it would create!
1348 2018-06-05 20:55:39 Just bought oil to help with my scar so this shit better work
1349 2018-06-05 20:55:38 It's been great tonight.
1350 2018-06-05 20:55:33 STOP PUTTING COCONUT OIL ON YOUR FACE
1351 2018-06-05 20:55:31 Getting your oil changed is so deflating. What a weird thing to spend $75 on 
1352 2018-06-05 20:55:19 Bit crap at business aren’t you,- oil prices shooting up, tariff impacts on the way, investors avoiding the US - your fault, you’re watch. The impact of your hand on the economy will now start and you’ll be shown for the incompetent, shallow conman you are Trump
1353 2018-06-05 20:55:04 @PressSec  Telling lies sure does come natural to you .Which side of the family did you get that from?You get any slicker doing that ...they will have to name an oil after you
1354 2018-06-05 20:54:55 So, the oil isn’t here it’s exported , and gas prices are up about 70cents a gallon over last year. So Boom, why is this good?
1355 2018-06-05 20:54:44 Sesame oil.  I cook with it and add it to every salad as the base of any dressing I make: I’m OBSESSED.
1356 2018-06-05 20:54:42 MBIE, the Ministry of Oil, pretends to care about climate change in order to make a ridiculous argument in favour of more fossil fuels! Govt Depts aligned to the oil industry think like this around the world
1357 2018-06-05 20:54:31 There’s oil in that Volcano

1364 2018-06-05 20:53:36 Natural gas and oil is projected to have more than 1.9 million new job opportunities by 2035. STEM-educated students will have significant advantages to succeed in the industry. That's why we're hosting our 4th annual #STEM and Empowerment Conference. #edcolo #education #energy
1365 2018-06-05 20:53:36 I guarantee you the only thing that oil will do for you is make your skin shine... but... to each his/her own
1366 2018-06-05 20:53:23 Agreed... as an Albertan in Canada I’m sick of seeing all the American and Chinese oil pigs buy up our pipeline businesses.. pisses me off
But they have the money and investors so we bend over...
1367 2018-06-05 20:53:19 Just watched the "BumbleBee" trailer and all I could think was this should have been called "Shape of Oil".
1368 2018-06-05 20:53:18 Image if @realDonaldTrump didn’t charge Americans for his golf trips and bill tax for Mar-o-Lago venues. Trump is the self proclaimed “King of Debt” selling snake oil to profit. Multiple bankruptcy files are not normal! #3000Lies
Stop the distractive & destructive @potus. #vote

1374 2018-06-05 20:52:38 You literally just tweeted an article to us that had an oil rig with mountains in the background to prove your economic point. So... yeah.
1375 2018-06-05 20:52:35 Let's encourage them to talk about the country's GDP and the effects of oil revenue in turkana,

1378 2018-06-05 20:52:14 How many millions are the oil companies paying you to sell your people out. Agents of Apartheid like U should never be allowed to speak for our Indigenous nations. You Indian Act Chiefs & political lobby group reps are nothing but shameless collaborating modern day Indian Agents.

1383 2018-06-05 20:51:52 Girl U and me both lbs, I used to use olive oil a lot when I used to get perms, I lowkey forgot about it lol..  but I just bought some argon oil yesterday so imma be trying that out
1384 2018-06-05 20:51:45 FACTS: #DivestmentFacts has a political agenda, and it's bought and paid for by gas and oil.
1385 2018-06-05 20:51:37 So ANNOYED. I spilt a WHOLE bottle of expensive Argon oil on my bed. A WHOLE expensive bottle  #silkysheets #argonoil #badluckfollowsme
1386 2018-06-05 20:51:15 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1387 2018-06-05 20:51:09 Then why did @WellsFargo just close a bunch of their locations? Because "divestment is futile"? This page is paid for by an oil lobby, nothing you say on divestment is factual. #DivestmentFacts
1388 2018-06-05 20:51:08 It depends all on what your standard of living is, your work, if you're flexible. But the city and the state are losing a lot of company people from oil and Natural resources, and that was a main income source. Now it's just tourism in summer and wait out the winter.
1389 2018-06-05 20:51:07 Don't need much courage to steal dat sweet oil oiiiiiii

1392 2018-06-05 20:50:44 Maybe lecithin is ok but oil and protein and edemame aren't?? I have no idea I'm losing my mind
1393 2018-06-05 20:50:40 No, not correct.  total US oil production exceed 10.4 million barrels a day, not exports.
1394 2018-06-05 20:50:40 who does cheap oil changes ????? I’m not paying $50
1395 2018-06-05 20:50:25 That actually sounds quite nice. No people, no distractions. Just me and Big Oil.
1396 2018-06-05 20:50:18 Sorry Candace, recent "wars" are fought for oil, dominance & profit (military industrial complex as Ike warned us!) and not for our freedom or defence (as we are led to believe). Sure, honor our military, but we must stop our war monger leaders & D.S..... BTW, I'm a Vet.

1400 2018-06-05 20:49:21 Droids do not feel pain. They avoid their own destruction so they can continue to do the job their masters program them to do. Your car doesn’t have a right to get it’s oil changed. Han shuts off 3P0 when he annoys him and 3P0 doesn’t give a shit.
1401 2018-06-05 20:49:16 Then I’m nuts, mix me in with the bolts and Reese’s pieces and we’ll enjoy the ride away from fossil fuels.  Those same gas increases can go toward Electric Vehicle incentives and Hybrid Incentives.  The worse it gets for Big Oil, the better for our lands, water and air quality

1414 2018-06-05 20:47:57 Yes, change can sure be tough when instead of beginning the transition to green, you instead unnecessarily spend all of the money to bail out a Texas Oil Corp in order to build more pipelines. Yep, great plan.
1415 2018-06-05 20:47:52 Journo friends. What do you do to get through the act of transcribing? I try to fool myself into thinking it's "me time" using diffusers/incense and instrumental music (current mood: grapefruit oil + godspeed), but should I just smoke drugs?
1416 2018-06-05 20:47:41 I like olive oil though.. I’m still getting used to this natural life lol
1417 2018-06-05 20:47:37 You can use solar power to run air conditioners, hot water heaters, and everything natural gas, electricity, or oil currently fuels. It’s the cheaper, safer, and more eco-friendly solution. #solarfactoftheday #freevolt #breakfree

1429 2018-06-05 20:46:20 My expectation is they have a very narrow supply range for oil sands, and so the price moves out of that band and you see a massive shut-in, but I don't think that's right, obvs.
1430 2018-06-05 20:45:56 Just a thought. We build oil pipelines to transport liquid gold from raw crude to processing plants. Why not design and build a water pipeline and system from flood prone areas to drought prone areas. Win win whose in.
1431 2018-06-05 20:45:49 The price of oil is rising in dollars too, isn’t it? And you know that there are few “simple” stories about numbers. Green perspective?

1523 2018-06-05 20:36:22 The person that looked at ripe plantain  and decided to dice it And drop in boiling oil to produce dodo or place it over flaming coals to produce  bole ,  may your blessings never go cold

1532 2018-06-05 20:35:38 Your moves @cvspharmacy @Walgreens @FredMeyerStores . You can't claim you care about your customers while selling unproven snake oil.
1533 2018-06-05 20:35:38 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost @michaelsantoli Why should #wti #oil at $65 impact the economy, remembered oil was at $90-$100 when the #USA GDP was lower! So US economy should be able to handle #wti $80+
1534 2018-06-05 20:35:24 Lol Japan is like that too, but the conversion rate is 1:100 so you feel like an oil tycoon when you pay your restaurant bill

1539 2018-06-05 20:34:45 Yes! And they're in the sun all day, they should be using some sort of overnight oil to replenish their skin
1540 2018-06-05 20:34:31 You have to wonder why gas prices are so high if we're exporting that much oil.
You also have to wonder why oil prices are so high when there is a huge glut of oil in the world. 
I guess big Crony Capitalist oil companies are loving all the profits they're making at our expense.
1541 2018-06-05 20:34:31 Two different things. Exporting by truck not economically viable. Long term option is pipeline and then we can expect a return. 2022 realistic date for revenues from the oil

Optional: eat it with roasted seaweed (Geem), or avacado, or meat, etc

1565 2018-06-05 20:31:48 what about those ppl who build houses on oil wells and gas veins are you going to do something about that?
1566 2018-06-05 20:31:13 Maybe he used some beard oil
1567 2018-06-05 20:31:10 Isn’t that what sociopaths and used car salesman , and snake oil salesmen always do ?  F you over , tell you it’s ‘great ‘ , and then expect to be ‘thanked ‘ for being screwed over ??
1568 2018-06-05 20:31:06 Benz update - oil pressure at idle issue may be my fault. I was using Valvoline High Mileage 10W40. Shop says car really needs 20W50... so we will see if that addresses the issue. Would be nice if it's just that...
1569 2018-06-05 20:31:02 How about the environment? Or are you another gas oil pig?
1570 2018-06-05 20:30:58 No worries. I never looked at some of the maps with a critical eye before and I think Kasyyyk gets away with a lot because of the Clone tank particularly being so fun and the meme-able oil refinary. Mustafar is still an absolute beast of a map though!

1573 2018-06-05 20:30:42 And yet you let them off with fines most of the time. Anyone remember the BAE bribery and Oil slush fund scandal? BAE still exists and is bigger than ever. Good job @FBI @NewYorkFBI Or how about when Pratt & Whitney violates ITAR restrictions routinely?
1574 2018-06-05 20:30:37 Come to find out. That fukker at Pep Boys changed the oil the wrong way, yes, there is a right & wrong way to change the damn oil. Lol. This MaaFukka ruined and reused the drain plug and almost cost us over $500 in unnecessary damages.

1582 2018-06-05 20:28:56 I very rarely got on they were tough times turning up each morning with a van full of fresh produce knowing you had virtually no chance of getting on! Then traipsing round the pubs almost giving it all away!

So we decided, to the Audi dealership we go.

1591 2018-06-05 20:28:01 me: actually

person who owns a cast iron skillet: it's fine to use soap, it's a misunderstanding of chemistry to say it destroys the seasoning. The oil forms long chains that attach to the iron of the pan and are not broken down by soap. However, they shouldn't be soaked.

1595 2018-06-05 20:27:41 You do realise that oil is used in manufacture of just about every part of our lives? It is used for medicine, steal manufacture, steal fabrication, plastics and tyres. It is also used as lubrication in every machine I can think of.
1596 2018-06-05 20:27:41 Oh I agree it doesn’t cost anymore to pump oil in the winter spring or summer but demand goes up

1599 2018-06-05 20:27:09 What religion was supposed to do in my opinion was transform the dense material int a refined product. Like refined oil refined can be used for many different products. It might definitely cause the transformed person to move on to higher platforms of enlightenment.

1606 2018-06-05 20:26:45 I would like to correct you there my learned friend,Petrol increase is determined by the price of the oil,check how much is the oil selling and in December it will be $100 per Burrell and petrol will increase to R18,The oil price is also influenced by global politics,Iran issues
1607 2018-06-05 20:26:42 The delusion that Singapore is some sort of free market paradise is a delusion peddled by snake oil salesmen like Dan Hannan.

1638 2018-06-05 20:23:38 coconut oil and avocado oil both have an exceptionally high smoke point. Avoid frying in extra virgin olive oil (low smoke point), but adding a bit of coconut oil to either butter or extra virgin olive oil raises the smoke point.

1652 2018-06-05 20:22:01 Amazing! You are really passionnate about oil! Great example...
1653 2018-06-05 20:21:59 Your (and Doug's) income bracket always benefit most from tax cuts, so I understand your blatant self interest. But don't complain about deficits at the same time. I don't want Ontario to end up like PC run Alberta was; low taxes and massive deficits (even when they had $100 oil)
1654 2018-06-05 20:21:47 Ah there argument is we trade more with the UK than the EU. On that level it is true if you exclude oil and gas. They suggest that if Scotland became independent that rUK trade would be in jeopardy. Which is complete fantasy as the UK wants to trade with EU & EFTA member states.

1661 2018-06-05 20:20:44 Workers did not empty or isolate the tank that contained crude oil prior to initiating hot work activities. Neither the contract company nor Partridge-Raleigh required written hot work permits. The contractor company did not provide hot work safety training to employees. 3/

1663 2018-06-05 20:20:35 Broth isn't supposed to have that much oil floating on top. That's why it's not to @GordonRamsay approval

1666 2018-06-05 20:20:17 NNPC group refused to disclose their earnings from crude oil sells and the volume of crude oil they extract daily, in accordance with the FOI act

1667 2018-06-05 20:20:10 Had leftover homemade garlic bread / crostini / stuff that used to be bread, drizzled with oil, spices and garlic, baked in the oven, for breakfast.

1673 2018-06-05 20:19:20 L:MAO, backlash from the oil industry does not equate to backlash from the consumer.
The oil industry already stopped electric cars over 100 years ago, of course they are going to do it now.

1681 2018-06-05 20:18:42 Nope. That is only ONE part of the plan. The other part is ensuring price certainty for consumers to stop gouging at the pumps. I am a commuter and look forward to the NDP helping us out. Ford is just putting money in the pockets of big oil companies.

1685 2018-06-05 20:18:19 I am having trouble drawing the line between increased exports of Canadian oil (AKA Kinder Morgan pipeline) and climate change. Help me understand.
1686 2018-06-05 20:18:08 I think its the irony of the rich oil colours combined with the strange perspective and spectre of imminent and certain death hanging over each image which gets me. I need to look at them again.
1687 2018-06-05 20:18:07 Imagine how much wildlife would be saved if you stopped killing animals for sport.
Imagine our waterways saved from oil spills.
1688 2018-06-05 20:17:54 So only chance you had of getting on was if the weather was so bad traders couldn’t get to market! If they missed 3 times they lost their pitch then one of the casuals took it

1693 2018-06-05 20:17:18 Same tho? I like to bake mine after I marinade it in olive oil and some sea salt. Nothing too fancy. But I'm gonna have to try it with onions!
1694 2018-06-05 20:17:12 My recollection is that refined coconut oil had a negative effect on blood lipids, but extra virgin did not. Regardless, neither are health foods.

1696 2018-06-05 20:16:55 .@Valvoline Apparently my car was overfilled with oil and leaked/caused my engine to completely shut down while I was on the road. Was at the Old Bridge Location, I'm really frustrated that this happened. My mechanic doesn't know if this can be salvaged. So thanks.
1697 2018-06-05 20:16:53 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for green tea muffins made with coconut flour, and put some jasmine essential oil in my diffuser.

1709 2018-06-05 20:15:44 Wrong? Where? Our flag is American, the good or evil of our history.  You try to spit shine it. What organized player group is representing their grievances? Surely they have more than one to act on.

1718 2018-06-05 20:14:53 why not push for local refinery on site? seeing as we are oil importers. we all know these are neocolonial and exploitative arrangements which will also lead to more theft. so don't pretend to be on our side. you are in the side of the foreign extractors and thieving class.

1759 2018-06-05 20:10:23 Incorrect, no disrespect but the Arib Spring was not home grown, it was CIA, Soros and social media using paid proxie militants in the uprising. Assad my be a dictator, but that's not our worry, it's all about oil pipes and access across Syria.
1760 2018-06-05 20:10:22 Good, but high oil prices are negating the benefits.

1763 2018-06-05 20:10:14 I take it every morning. Consistency has helped. I’ve noticed improvement over time taking it daily. I supplement with the pill form and a topical oil applied to pain points if I’m having a rough day. It might not be the answer for everyone but it has helped me a lot.

1792 2018-06-05 20:08:06 Turkana's oil reserves are about 600 million barrels. At an expected extraction rate of 200,000bl/per day (when full production starts in 2022), the oil will run out in less than ten years. We are nowhere in the league of big producers
1793 2018-06-05 20:07:51 Firstly I’m not gonna question if the gov respects her or not cuz I wouldn’t know but I was making the point that “puppet” can be used in the context of the US-Kurdish relationship as SDF was used as cannon fodder to take dier for the oil and will lose manbig to to appease 
1794 2018-06-05 20:07:37 Educating is really important. Mind you, I think we have lost the art of selling because of supermarkets and traders just except the consumer to buy. We start the journey by just saying hello.....
1795 2018-06-05 20:07:31 I use Charlotte’s Web Hemp Extract Oil Plus (they offer 3 strengths. “Plus” is the medium strength) in the tincture form. I’ve used pill form, but the tincture works best for me. I haven’t tried vaping, as I don’t have a medical marijuana card. I use 2 full droppers per day.
1796 2018-06-05 20:07:27 I remember this one time me and Mia were like 5 or 6 and we never went to the skating ring and we ended up putting baby oil all over my floor to pretend we were skating LMFAO 
1797 2018-06-05 20:07:22 Hey Aimz, Saw your post about the CBD oil, both my girlfriend and my father manage their pain with marijuana products. I would be happy to chat with you about the products and how they can help.

1810 2018-06-05 20:05:10 Very easy to make popcorn in a pot on the stove and I can't figure out what you did that required 20" of cleaning (forget the oil?).
1811 2018-06-05 20:05:01 Betsy DeVos is a stepford head of Dept. of Education for the far right. Just as the EPA head is the Pinocchio puppet of oil barons. Yes men will be afforded the comeuppance they deserve.
1812 2018-06-05 20:04:58 It's the same in every small business. People expect magic and don't think outside the box. I'm paying £40....and that's it. No ideas, no motivation, no promoting themselves. Got to educate them. #Indiehour

Would you order one of these?
1817 2018-06-05 20:04:04 My favorite: Oil will run out, and the price of oil will crash.
1818 2018-06-05 20:03:33 Oil prices shut down the tarsands. Not profitable to extract when price <$90 barrel.

Venezuela wasn't socialist in the 80s and it suffered from the same crashes. It's an issue with Venezuela's over-reliance in oil, socialism.

1860 2018-06-05 19:58:31 The topic is that we should all segregate by race into naturally bordered areas because once the oil runs out and we have an economic crisis it's what we will do anyway, like in prison, and this guy tried to use Libya as an example

1869 2018-06-05 19:57:08 I made myself spinach filled ravioli and put olive oil on it instead of butter this time bc I'm high and was wondering why it smelled/tasted kinda gross but then I remembered I usually put butter

1871 2018-06-05 19:57:05 Addas adds that engagement is most effective when you're putting pressure on companies to improve/reduce practices that aren't "core to their business." He has "zero hope" that working with fossil-fuels and oil companies will make them sell less, for ex. #RIACon18

1875 2018-06-05 19:56:52 Hi Sharon. I think it goes deeper than this. I think the reason they don’t bring enough oil is because they think they have enough—because they expect Him to show up earlier. Jesus told us to be watching if He comes in the second or third watch (Lk 12:38).
1876 2018-06-05 19:56:46  Portuguese Cuisine - Caldo Verde is the most traditional of Portuguese soups and is as simple as it gets: onions, potatoes and kale, cooked with garlic and olive oil. It is often served with a slice of smoked pork sausage and cornbread. #CupcakeHour

1885 2018-06-05 19:55:45 CBD oil really works!  Learn more about how it might help chronic pain, sleep disorders, anxiety and more.  And, why pay retail for it?  Buy CBD oil at wholesale rates through CBD of Naples!  #CBD #chronicpain #sleepbetter #anxiety #discountCBD #CBDwholesale

1890 2018-06-05 19:55:16 Yes. The express and original mousse are my favorites, the in shower one works pretty well, and the dry oil is good for maintaining any kind of self tanners or spray tan in between
1891 2018-06-05 19:55:12 Who knows how many cows he owns? Nigeria should own cows like Niger Delta oil. I can now see that cow is a resource in Nigeria. It should not be owned by individuals

1910 2018-06-05 19:53:10 If sufficient revenue is generated from oil exports I thought it would be logical to assume taxation will reduce. The reason we are overtaxed is due to limited sources of revenue, no?
1911 2018-06-05 19:53:09 Draft dodging, bone-spur traitor Trump can't respect the American flag. Trump is also an ardent Racist.

1926 2018-06-05 19:51:31 seeing the wonder of the caverns and the thousands of years it took to produce these lands, how can we allow drilling for oil there? the destruction will be devastating and we will have lost a natl treasure for a politician's greed. this must be stopped. we must protect them

I waited 1hr to get a ride back home from the shuttle they provide, to realize once I got home I dont have my fucking keys!!!l
1935 2018-06-05 19:51:05 I accidentally ate one on a ceasar salad before, saltiest food in existence!!  It actually makes a great ceasar salad dressing, but that is only using a little bit of the oil!
1936 2018-06-05 19:51:00 Me and Arron already on the oil kid
1937 2018-06-05 19:50:35 Not to mention the 3 pie stalls and 12 cakes stalls lol. Just pack em in to make the money.
1938 2018-06-05 19:50:27 It's not strange at all. Money "lubricates" the wheels of commerce (the alternative being barter) so imagining a model in which money is represented by oil, is obvious. It also explodes the idea that printing money is in any way helpful.
1939 2018-06-05 19:50:17 The way Zamfara girls love cars you will swear to God and say they were breastfeed with engine oil.
1940 2018-06-05 19:50:10 We’ve just started a weekly stall in Richmond there are a lot of factors to consider #indiehour
1941 2018-06-05 19:50:09 Just got my baby a set of new tires for our anniversary, oil change tonight 
1942 2018-06-05 19:50:07 castor oil!!
1943 2018-06-05 19:50:01 Depends on the tools and how often I'd see myself using them. To be honest I'm not that keen on messy jobs, don't mind a smear of grease or tubeless sealant, but kind of draw the line at oil and seals. Do that on the car every 9k so can't really be arsed
1944 2018-06-05 19:49:48 CBD oil has been working so great for me with pain management and it seems like my flare up has gone right down!!!!!
1945 2018-06-05 19:49:48 Mostly oil pumps Stn r with congress leaders in UK & all.chk UPA govt comp price chart too..so why drama to fool public.if u r fr public.leave ur profit part.only criticism is not solutions @narendramodi @PMOIndia @BJP4India
1946 2018-06-05 19:49:26 They say you learn something new every day

Today "Jessica" at Walgreens let me know that Astroglide is not actually an "essential oil"
1947 2018-06-05 19:49:03 Oh you mean crying from the oil industry? Lol. Like the crying from the meat industry that’s happening at the moment?

1951 2018-06-05 19:48:41 Exactly another problem I find stalls to close together no room to look at produce
1952 2018-06-05 19:48:35 That works.

1954 2018-06-05 19:48:31 @nailogical Holo Cristine! I have a nail oil question for you. I have a nail oil dropper that I’ve been trying to use more frequently, and yesterday I looked at the ingredients. It says it’s made with mineral oil. Is this good to use or should I switch to jojoba oil???
1955 2018-06-05 19:48:24 my Mom and I were out in the shed a cricket  scared Mom causing her step in a bucket of Motor oil we laughed our ass off 
1956 2018-06-05 19:48:23 waiting for my oil change to be done:

*pulls single piece of gum I brought in out of my pocket*

lady next to me- do you have another piece?

me with the truth- sorry no I only brought one piece 

dumb lady- I think you’re lying...so rude 

this is MY gum I don’t KNOW u piss OFF
1957 2018-06-05 19:48:19 Thank God your back we missed you more than you can imagine. Happy Anniversary and thanks for bringing up natural gas. Frack around the clock  and don't want to mention it in our energy grid. Sending that guy a link natural gas reliability & billions $'s subsidizing big oil
1958 2018-06-05 19:48:18 When you’re getting your oil changed and the mechanic opens your glove compartment and there’s a bottle of md  I’m weak
1959 2018-06-05 19:48:17 My skin routine consist of water & baby oil 
1960 2018-06-05 19:48:01 That's your curl pattern babe. To make it stronger you can use Castor oil. Also, before you decide which products to use, you need to do a porosity test so you see how your hair retains moisture
1961 2018-06-05 19:47:50 You didn't see backlash? Manufacturers had plans and models ready for electric cars well before they were introduced. And the oil industry did everything in their power to hinder their launches. So you just arent aware... gotcha.
1962 2018-06-05 19:47:44 Honestly moisturizing my face (including my under eyes) with aloe vera has changed my life. Ice cubes help with puffiness which make the bags look less intense too! I also have a love for washing my face with coconut oil.
1963 2018-06-05 19:47:40 Man is a good writer. 

Just finish Oil, Politics and Violence.

1965 2018-06-05 19:47:25 You're spot on there
1966 2018-06-05 19:47:20 My oil pen isn't in my backpack  ruh roh
1967 2018-06-05 19:47:19 Getting my oil changed and this lady is changing her baby in the floor of the lobby..is that normal?
1968 2018-06-05 19:47:17 We go to big events to recce and when you look, actually look at the people there, very few are carrying bags. Some of the event organisers have absolutely no idea. Perhaps they need a Nowt Poncy organiser lol
1969 2018-06-05 19:47:06 Put pure castor oil on your eye lids before bed. It sounds mad but it honestly works. I was on steroid sprays, 6 antihistamines a day and still had water streaming from my eyes. Don't need anything now. A deffo game changer .
1970 2018-06-05 19:47:02 No time ? What nonsense. The meth thing is yesterday’s news. The revelations about oil & gas decision & how it was done is a big issue. PM got away with it. Shame on RNZ.
1971 2018-06-05 19:46:55 That's a great point we did a local food festival for years first year I think it was £100 for weekend then went to £200 we done the lasts one 3 yr ago £350 & they said it would double to £700 next year so I said no chance & not a local stall on there now #Indiehour

1976 2018-06-05 19:46:16 I roast it with some olive oil, salt and a tiny bit of sugar. It’s lovely and crispy, a great snack and good side for texture, depending of what you’re cooking. But to cook, I prefer cavolo Nero!
1977 2018-06-05 19:46:15 They are the BOMB. I do one with chunked up potatoes, carrots, and smoked sausages and a bunch of onion and like a head of garlic. You literally just toss everything in olive oil and seasonings and roast it and it's delicious.

But there's ALL kinds of variations.
1978 2018-06-05 19:46:02 Not at all.  It was a tradition.
1979 2018-06-05 19:46:00 I also find it very useful to listen to less skeptical shows like @TheLTBNetwork and @epicenterbtc to keep up with snake oil scams. It might be fun to go back & listen to some Bitcoin Uncensored shows or the current Junseth's World (you have to search those, don't have a handle)
1980 2018-06-05 19:45:48 Morgan: “My chest feels acidic”

1981 2018-06-05 19:45:36 coconut oil so bomb .
1982 2018-06-05 19:45:31 No, superstars ALWAYS cost more! The real problem is when man city pay £55million for sterling or stones! That's what's inflated the Market! Paying massively over the odds for average players because you have an oil rich state buying everything
1983 2018-06-05 19:45:27 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
1984 2018-06-05 19:45:13 You do realize Hillary isnt in office? She literally sold out our uranium to Russia while profiting 184 million via foundation. Biden’s son runs oil pipes in Russia. Muller was involved in the cover ops- Media covers up for d but lies about t and everyone chases the shiny lies
1985 2018-06-05 19:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1986 2018-06-05 19:45:05 He’s restoring the oil field which creates jobs
1987 2018-06-05 19:45:03 Almost got my car wrecked.A moment to remind car owners to check  the oil level. I know there's always a rush to move out everyday, but just find the time..Also just a three minute warm before moving.
1988 2018-06-05 19:44:59 Totally agree. Very often the only people making money are the organisers. Combine alcohol, music and street food and it's a disaster.
1989 2018-06-05 19:44:58 It's not dangerous.  Directly eating pot will not get you high.  It has to be activated by baking or turning it into oil.
1990 2018-06-05 19:44:57 Öl ist am Fahrrad zu 95%iger Sicherheit immer an den Stellen, an denen es nicht, und fehlt dort, wo es gebraucht wird. #bikepunx #oil #LifeHack

1993 2018-06-05 19:44:46 HB 2154 - Conventional Oil and Gas Wells Act - passes 111-84 (I voted yes)

1995 2018-06-05 19:44:32 Saw a Tesla in Sweden with the license plate "LOL OIL"

1997 2018-06-05 19:44:23 Nurofen followed by fish and chips seem to have persuaded it to ease off for now. Bt I think I might have some oil of cloves
1998 2018-06-05 19:44:13 This coconut oil is doing wonders for my hair 
1999 2018-06-05 19:43:49 If you don't like oil stop using it. Protesting approved and studied projects is ludicrous. If investors want fossil fuels fine, bet against them and invest in green energy. By protesting you are only challenging the rule of law, causing for example pipeline buyouts.
2000 2018-06-05 19:43:48 Do we have to export oil when we're importing oil? 
Just asking...
2001 2018-06-05 19:43:36 STOP SENDING THEM TO WARS FOR OIL AND BANKERS
2002 2018-06-05 19:43:16 Cloves or clove oil
2003 2018-06-05 19:43:10 I agree. I have seen the growth of veggie festivals in the past three or four years. It's has now become a business for the event organisers. They are charging more and many of the small local businesses who started at these events can no longer afford to go. #Indiehour
2004 2018-06-05 19:42:44 @NZNationaIParty so why no outcry about stopping oil exploration? So you don’t think the world is going to need anymore in 30 years time? Your silence is forever deafening
2005 2018-06-05 19:42:42 Just tried the baby oil tan remover malarkey and i might of been a bit too impatient for it to take off all my tan BUT my god am I moisturised, literally feel like a dolphin I’m so smooth

2007 2018-06-05 19:42:34 This 7 year old has been coming to our youth Jiu Jitsu program for over a year now. He has severe rheumatoid Arthritis , over 5 different meds. Finally talked his mom into trying out CBD Oil, 2 months later he is off 4 of those Meds! Less doctor visits and he’s in less pain 
2008 2018-06-05 19:42:32 Clean energy won't make fossil fuels obsolete by 2035. But they are likely to cause the price of fossil fuels to crash. You don't need a lot of EVs on the road, for example, to really hurt demand for oil.
2009 2018-06-05 19:42:31 普通に感想読んでたらまたoilで笑い止まらん
2010 2018-06-05 19:42:21 @EmmaHardieUK @EmmaHardieUK Bought a new pot of balm in marks, there’s a layer of oil on top, is this normal? Not seen in my prev 4 pots??
2011 2018-06-05 19:42:11 if you put castor oil on your eyebrows everyday will it make the hair grow? lol

2014 2018-06-05 19:41:53 Looks like it was filled with sand at one time? I don't see oil on top of the water, that is good.
2015 2018-06-05 19:41:50 That is not so. The greatest achievement is how a spineless, ex oil co exec became a completely wet rag who fails to uphold Christian values and worships at the altar of political correctness. Wake up Welby. You’re a disgrace. The EU is just another cosy club for elites.

2019 2018-06-05 19:41:08 Everyone saying we should spend $4.5 B on something other than Trans Mountain is missing how Trudeau/Morneau see it: in terms of decades of future taxes from the oil sands. They are wrong, however, to think the industry has a profitable future
2020 2018-06-05 19:40:56 It's methane!
2021 2018-06-05 19:40:52 I’ve been suffering with migraines the last few weeks and I’ve done some preliminary research on CBD oil being used to help w/ migraines. 

Have any of you used cbd oil before? Would you recommend? I’m getting pretty desperate & taking RX pain meds every day doesn’t seem healthy
2022 2018-06-05 19:40:51 I trade rarely gold oil and dax because  are very volatile and risky is very difficult to mage your risk . The jpy is not that volatile during European and US session but it can become very volatile during Asian session rarely . I recommend to traders to trade jpy.
2023 2018-06-05 19:40:46 I remove my eye make up with castor oil and my eyelashes are so much longer because of it
2024 2018-06-05 19:40:45 I stopped using products and just use oil and water
2025 2018-06-05 19:40:42 Without Midnight Oil and True Crime Podcasts I'd know nothing about the geography of Australia.
2026 2018-06-05 19:40:37 Truthfully tho, these stories are like "peak oil" - always juuuuuust around the corner, yet never seem to actually happen once we get there.

OTOH, one pit human ingenuity and innovation v taxing authority, so....
2027 2018-06-05 19:40:36 If my memory serves correctly they have been saying for decades that Social Security system was going broke. During the oil supply crisis in 1970s I attended a meeting where rep of Shell Oil Co. was speaker, & he said we were running out of crude oil.
2028 2018-06-05 19:40:24 I make it with chilli oil and balsamic vinegar...
2029 2018-06-05 19:40:22 Agree with what moses said! Also dave jones does not take money from big oil, insurance industry, charter school association, tobacco industry, walmart, or private prisons, while Xavier does! For me that's s game changer bc we need more clean money candidates paving the way!!
2030 2018-06-05 19:40:22 Right. Trump had everything to do with the oil market, which shows again how little you know. Oh, and do you know why gasoline prices have been rising?

2032 2018-06-05 19:40:13 Where they are not wanted. Under gadaffi there were no homelessuch people. Free healthcare and education. Newlyweds were given 50k to buy their house. They killed Gadaffi because he wanted to sell oil in dinar and not us dollar and now Libya is rotten.
2033 2018-06-05 19:40:10 What do you think $150 barrel of oil would do to the coal market?

2041 2018-06-05 19:39:20 You also forgot:

 Pollute our waterways
 Let oil spills happen
 Get rid of regulations so that way companies can do this without being fined.

2043 2018-06-05 19:39:14 If BA are really bringing back two 747s from storage (is that one actually true Scott?) Then the contrast is huge. Of course if oil gets too peaky that decision looks less rosy, but still...

2047 2018-06-05 19:39:05 I have a similar, far more painful, occurrence with peppers. FYI...washing your hands just once doesn’t get all the oil off.

2049 2018-06-05 19:38:53 Found the cure for nausea. Peppermint oil and ginger oil in a diffuser. Works a treat. Just don’t eat it .
2050 2018-06-05 19:38:51 I like how time appears to go super fast today. Made a pizza, even took time to peel garlic, it's always stronger when from "original packaging". Greens wilted nicely on it, cheese, tomato sauce, roll out dough, spices, olive oil.
In a blink of an eye it was done, like delivered.

2053 2018-06-05 19:38:33 Norway is a bad example. First they have a fraction of the US population. Second, their entire social safety net is funded by their oil exports. When the oil industry dries up, which will happen one day, their entire system will fail.
2054 2018-06-05 19:38:33 Hi Georgia.  We are looking to stop selling Eggs from caged hens by 2025, although we know that others have moved faster. Plastics and the removal of palm oil is taking up a lot of resource, but animal welfare is incredibly important to us, so we do want to make it a priority.

2068 2018-06-05 19:37:27 @Canada Canada government should think over building the Oil pipeline in to America, because of Donald Trump resent action against Canada

2073 2018-06-05 19:37:12 We raise Brent oil prices from $60/bbl to $74/bbl in 2018 (up 23%), $72.50 in 2019 (21%), $67.5/bbl in 2020 and $65 long term - to reflect the rapid market rebalancing and a projected continuing inventory drop in 2018. SosGen #OOTT
2074 2018-06-05 19:37:12 I’m slicker than an oil spill , try me bitch 
2075 2018-06-05 19:37:12 Wait wait I got another one. @Premises187 changes chicks more times than I change tyres. He changes women more than I change oil. He changes ladies more times than I change my vape liquid 
2076 2018-06-05 19:36:52 I just bought a cool new shoes Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

2078 2018-06-05 19:36:26 The constant social media posts don't help. I can't count the number of people who give out their essential oil combos for everything--waiting to see them do it for broken bones. I have lupus and other auto immune conditions and saw a post for this crap this morning.
2079 2018-06-05 19:36:03 I have not tried the vale oil 4000 mg straw berry milk shake. @CuredTheAddict

2081 2018-06-05 19:35:51 Can’t see my mileage cause my tire pressure light has been on but I’m sure I need an oil change too

2083 2018-06-05 19:35:46 I need to hurry up and go get a oil change
2084 2018-06-05 19:35:41 Remember the Russian’s oil deal that got us here
2085 2018-06-05 19:35:28 Yeah she's a stray we found her covered in oil but she's a lot better now

2087 2018-06-05 19:35:22 Hearing Mick’s shout he quickly wipes his hands free of machine oil and wanders upstairs from the lab. Following the sound of Sara’s voice he smiles. “Hey Sara! You guys stop by for a visit?”
2088 2018-06-05 19:35:21 Ugh I have to use heat protector, hairs spray and oil sheen just to control frizz and fly aways. I have to give this product a try. #Biolage #HealthyStyling #contest. @InfluensterVox

2094 2018-06-05 19:34:40 I just had a conversation with my favorite yoonmin writer about FISH OIL. lowkey freaking out but also wondering what even is my life.
2095 2018-06-05 19:34:39 Why would man use beard oil when he doesn't have a beard?
2096 2018-06-05 19:34:37 Snake oil
2097 2018-06-05 19:34:31 i’ve heard that from a couple ppl too. i heard coconut oil works too!
2098 2018-06-05 19:34:30 People are always changing, for proof look at my dad who once fed me boxed macaroni he turned into soup by accident

And now makes traditional North African breakfasts for us while explaining how he learned the recipe from a local while in the oil patch

2099 2018-06-05 19:34:30 Brother I am with you.
Here are 2 Questions:
1. Where are the WMD's of Sadam that caused America to invade Iraq in 2003?

2. What the f*ck are the Americans still doing in Iraq in 2018? Looking for them WMD's in the oil wells???
2100 2018-06-05 19:34:26 4th of July is right around the corner!! Watch what gas prices do!! I’m surprised that the oil companies haven’t jacked prices up because of the volcano eruptions in Hawaii and Guatemala!!
2101 2018-06-05 19:33:34 bought a new hair oil and its smells so gooood 
2102 2018-06-05 19:33:23 SOLAR ENERGY
It’s clean energy!
It’s renewable energy!
It’s non-polluting energy!
It works for homes and cars!
It’s free energy!
It’s a total no-brainer!!
Oh wait! Republicans and big oil can’t make any money from it!!!
2103 2018-06-05 19:33:17 Quería recordarle a YPF, como controlante de Oil, que entre los activos de la petrolera hay varias empresas de medios. Por si no sabían. Y pasado mañana es el Día del Periodista. Abrazo.
2104 2018-06-05 19:33:15 1. We are not energy independent #fakenews
2. Energy independent means not begging OPEC to increase production, like U.S. just did
3. Energy independent means market driven and diverse. Oil has 92% transportation market share. That's a monopoly. And we all pay the price.
2105 2018-06-05 19:33:10 Oui, en français, est un adverbe utilisé pour marquer son accord, marquer une réponse positive ou pour répondre à un appel. Il dérive du latin hoc ille (celui-ci), par l'ancien français oïl (prononcé [wi] ou [wil]). Vŏlō est le terme latin qui signifie vouloir et les formes diale
2106 2018-06-05 19:33:07 Because it's a free market, a world market. I would think it would take congress to pass a law restricting the sale of American produced oil on the open market for that to happen. Doubt it would stand a court challenge. Probably only in  time of a national emergency, such as war.
2107 2018-06-05 19:33:02 It really varies and there is a lack of control over it. Prices can be from £20 to three figures at a weekend market. If it's £100 plus that's a lot of sales to make your stall money back, never mind a wage! #Indiehour

2110 2018-06-05 19:32:39 The @JustinTrudeau Liberals were elected in 2015 based on progressive ideas that included climate change, saying no to Northern Gateway because of oil tanker risk and the @jjhorgan NDP have been crystal clear since 2013 and @adriandix on the #TMX. No surprises there!
2111 2018-06-05 19:32:23 That's how it should be

2113 2018-06-05 19:31:58 Im just listening to myself blowing THC oil
2114 2018-06-05 19:31:51 Once again, study with no credibility. We still oil for tires (even if you ride a bike), running shoes, kayaks, and thousands of other products. Oil isn’t going away. Best figure out how to make it clean
2115 2018-06-05 19:31:48 No - do what China is doing - switching fr USD's & UST's to US oil, US grains, US tech, US gold, US real estate...
2116 2018-06-05 19:31:25 Again Oil and Gas sector and Media again caught LYING!!!!!losing all credibility.
2117 2018-06-05 19:31:20 Oh yeah. Just took out the old ones & there knackered. Also need some fox float oil if they have some for a rear shock service. Already have the O rings 
2118 2018-06-05 19:31:19 Imagine an economic engine in which money is represented by oil.
The faster the engine turns, the faster the oil circulates.
Engine output is wealth. and GDP is thus measurable by oil volume.
Clearly, adding more oil than necessary, does not help. Nor does diluting what we have.
2119 2018-06-05 19:30:37 cbd oil banned?
2120 2018-06-05 19:30:35 Watching these brothers do my oil change & replacing my coolant & trying to see if I can do it myself. Hmmm
2121 2018-06-05 19:30:31 But why did they come home under that flag. Because of an unjust war for oil and bankers within the past 40 years. Not standing doesnt mean you disrespect the dead. It means you dont agree with the elitists who order them to die to oil and money

2125 2018-06-05 19:30:16 For lunch I just had 4 tomatoes cut up with olive oil and salt and pepper, two eggs on top, and an avocado on the side and I really wish I would have gone with my original idea which was 10 tomatoes cut up with no eggs or avocado #tomatoseason #tomatolover #ilivefortomatoes
2126 2018-06-05 19:30:11 You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
2127 2018-06-05 19:30:06 We’re ALL ‘alright’ living in powerful devolved country within safety net of a pooling & sharing U.K.(as clearly  shown when oil industry slumped) -aren’t we lucky to have best of both worlds. We know what we have, key question is what Indi could offer that we don’t already have
2128 2018-06-05 19:30:03 Khodorkovsky would know, was wealthiest man in Russia, built massive Yukos Oil until he took on Putin who arrested him, seized & auctioned Yukos tho only 1bidder, a Russia govt shell, paid like $3B (worth $40B at the time) & merged w/state-owned Gazprom. Now Putin worth billions!

2132 2018-06-05 19:29:27 Because of the wide criticism, Benny Hinn, has taken down his "Place order for Anointing Oil for $25" advert. It's been taken off the internet.
2133 2018-06-05 19:28:54 Coconut oil is a life saver 
2134 2018-06-05 19:28:50 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
2135 2018-06-05 19:28:48 これはおこですね
2136 2018-06-05 19:28:35 I thought #wwe stopped the use of baby oil?
2137 2018-06-05 19:28:31 From the Globe today;
“A lot of Canadian-made reality TV is unwatchable because it’s pointless and usually a second-rate copy of an original. Queen of the Oil Patch is, in contrast, truly distinct, about a true original. And truly inspiring. This is wonderful TV.”
2138 2018-06-05 19:28:24 It’s renewable energy. Hell its damn near the perfect energy source of perpetual motion.
2139 2018-06-05 19:28:21 Eat that big oil companies.

2140 2018-06-05 19:28:11 Idk what she thinking like I was ever going to voluntarily swallow some castor oil 
2141 2018-06-05 19:28:03 IMO, it fits what we've been describing.  China does not want to settle trade in UST's anymore.  US oil, US ag products, US tech companies, etc = great.  Challenge = balancing US gov'ts $1T deficit on ag & oil alone will require YUGE commodity inflation.

2143 2018-06-05 19:27:16 Figuring out where leverage is can be difficult. Case in point - Latin American debt crisis. The Gulf had huge current account surpluses in 1970s from oil export, so they invested that money in NY banks, which lent it to Argentina and Brazil. When oil price fell, credit tightened
2144 2018-06-05 19:27:11 ngaruhh. oiya gue juga pake baby oil di bulu mata dan itu ngaruh banhet
2145 2018-06-05 19:27:07 You can have the lot, but the nose etc, were taken off. Next time I'm keeping the ears.

Pig cheeks are stunning, but it's only a small amount of meat, so it's made up with other meats. The head is quite fatty, but the oil makes the most amazing chips or roast potatoes.
2146 2018-06-05 19:27:00 Hey there! The certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm). (1)
2147 2018-06-05 19:26:56 Every major trend has been challenged in 2018.  Falling US Dollar, Rising Treasury Yields, Fang (March), and Rising Oil.  

Please note, the CNBC love fest on big cap tech over the past two days. Thesis is that tech has no risk to a trade war.
2148 2018-06-05 19:26:55 Happy birthday to u may God bless u $ anointed u with a new oil !!!
2149 2018-06-05 19:26:41 ขอบคุณค้าบ แอ๊บหนักเลยรูปนี้
2150 2018-06-05 19:26:37 Nah seriously I try and look for the positive in every bad situation. Praying tomorrow goes well. My poor baby is leaking with oil 
2151 2018-06-05 19:26:35 The day oil runs out:")
2152 2018-06-05 19:26:30 Been sitting here since 7am waitong on my truck...oil change turns into cracked brake shoe and new steer tires and something else.
2153 2018-06-05 19:26:16 Basically they are very likely to hit oil in the Mengo Sands and dust in the Djeno Sands...
What's 8mmboe worth to Mcap? There's your answer. End of Discussion...
2154 2018-06-05 19:26:14 i'm not shocked. Republicans and Democrats that take money from big oil are the representatives of chaos which is anathema to "getting things done".
2155 2018-06-05 19:26:04 Agree, but even amongst the roses the warning signs are there from what I have seen.  Increasing oil prices, commodity pricing and new order volume lower.  So may not be that stable and I wonder how profitable any growth is. #manufacturinghour
2156 2018-06-05 19:25:57 Yep
2157 2018-06-05 19:25:53 @TheKochBrothers Dear George and David,

2160 2018-06-05 19:25:36 I’ll reconnect the dots for you since it seems you get lost easily.  Once a crook always a crook.  Donald Trump has been a snake oil salesman his entire life and he bought your vote through lies and deception and you just aren’t willing to realize or admit it.
2161 2018-06-05 19:25:36 That's great to hear
2162 2018-06-05 19:25:21 Yeah.I get really dry skin and no moisturiser works apart from coconut oil.
2163 2018-06-05 19:25:18 ピアノをベッドにして遊ぼうよ…
2164 2018-06-05 19:25:05 Often my lunches are just abominable mixes of healthy food that I think tastes good.

Today I made some kinda weird slop out of tuna, an egg, avocado mayonaise, coconut oil, asparagus, beef tallow, and some leftover bacon grease from breakfast.

It tasted SO GOOD.
2165 2018-06-05 19:25:04 Yes, it was. I finally got home after train delays & cancellations at 5pm Been looking forward to trying this oil for ages. Bliss!  #GreenwichHour
2166 2018-06-05 19:25:03 Saracens price hike has gone down as well as a vegan dinner on an oil rig.
2167 2018-06-05 19:25:01 Because then how would the oil companies get paid?
2168 2018-06-05 19:24:43 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2169 2018-06-05 19:24:34 Seriously, it isn't. I'm not spending another year of my life campaigning for independence-lite. We need change. Scotland is hugely unequal, our environment is hugely degraded, and we're pumping oil when the climate is already likely to overshoot 2 degrees.
2170 2018-06-05 19:24:31 Still not convinced tho, each wee tweek of something, pump goes, oil heats up, tractor heats up. Maybe it's just me! 
2171 2018-06-05 19:24:28 Boil tiny potatoes, squish them, make them brown and crispy in a little skillet with olive oil and shallots, dump in some sardines, then finish with an egg, lemon juice, parsley, parm, red pepper flakes, whatever
2172 2018-06-05 19:24:26 Liquid chlorophyll, apple cider vinegar, flacseed oil tabs, glucosamine tab & lysine tab. Ih and can't forget 
2173 2018-06-05 19:24:22 Ever wonder about the USA supporting the side of either Israeli vs palestinians fighting? Why is that? Control and OIL interests. #EndAllWars #UnnecessaryViolence
2174 2018-06-05 19:24:00 You tell them! If you wanna go work on oil rig with your hubby then you go work on that rig lol
2175 2018-06-05 19:23:57 She should give it another try. Edibles are good for nonsmokers. Or like her father, CBD oil.
2176 2018-06-05 19:23:57 I knowwwww here mum always have fritessaus thats a kind of mayo which is sweetter and not as fat. Less oil
2177 2018-06-05 19:23:39 Hi @Sairah_Butt I mean these pop up local street markets etc not proper town markets 
2178 2018-06-05 19:23:32 Good. Now that we've bought it we can shut the whole thing down. No more dirty oil. No more threat of extinction from this project. #ShutDownTransMountain #CloseTheTarSands
2179 2018-06-05 19:23:27 So, I zoomed into this yoruba girls picture and pepper entered my eyes, does that mean I should goan use vegetable oil do eye drop?
2180 2018-06-05 19:23:26 I blocked and reported the Binance crypto garbage. It seems like a deliberate attack on $IONS & $AKCA. Just being mentioned beside their worthless crap lowers investor’s opinions if they associate the stocks with this snake oil.
2181 2018-06-05 19:23:24 Oh they are so cool.  They aren't oily like other seabirds, which is why you see them doing that wing-spread drying off thing all the time. Oil would make them too buoyant to dive, I think.
2182 2018-06-05 19:23:09 Sometimes if I run out of either I’ll use an all organic coconut oil. This takes my makeup right off. I get all my products from target or Walmart 
2183 2018-06-05 19:23:05 You know we are going to ask about this oil thing. So y'all better prepare. .the blood of Ken Sarowiwa is still roaming the African soils. We don't want any more bloodshed because of black gold. We know better, we want better, we demand better.
2184 2018-06-05 19:22:53 I think you answered you own comment no prob with making a profit but the food fest around here go for max ground rent so if you not in catering of some sort then no chance I run markets and hope to run a food fest in September free entry and sensible rents watch this space
2185 2018-06-05 19:22:48 @realDonaldTrump  We will honor our flag by standing and be thankful for the opportunity of a lifetime. I would be honored to be invited and represent truck drivers and the oil and gas industry
2186 2018-06-05 19:22:48 These #Sorostitute sock accounts use absurdities to try and make their point. The go to insults, profanity, bigotry, and TOS violations to try to get a reaction. It’s not worth your time. You can’t reach them with logic and facts.

They di’it straigh out the trailer with whatever motor oil they had lyin’round.

2199 2018-06-05 19:21:24 Ugh ur man can change your oil I’m sweating
2200 2018-06-05 19:21:18 I’m comparing it to other industries all the time in other areas and so are many people. Not a deflection.

Why would cannabis create money laundering worries if oil, or restaurants, or tech startups or car washes don’t? Why treat this industry wholly differently?
2201 2018-06-05 19:21:16 Hey Trump haters!!
America is EXPORTING OIL

2208 2018-06-05 19:20:15 Just whipping cream and a little flour with the oil from the pan. Then add your spinach
2209 2018-06-05 19:20:13 Surely everyone knows by now that @ShankerASingham is nothing but a snake oil salesman.

The dustbin that is the IEA is a perfect home for him.

2211 2018-06-05 19:20:03 Bought this dark tanning oil & this shit working crazy , wait till I get to the beach & the sun hit me
2212 2018-06-05 19:20:01 Well done Julio. I like it. Oil, Acrylic, or Watercolor? Or maybe some of this digital media we have these days? I can’t tell looking at it on my phone.
2213 2018-06-05 19:20:00 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2214 2018-06-05 19:19:59 Would you look at that I've happened into the room raising my hand for no reason. And I just happen to have an essential massage oil blend 
2215 2018-06-05 19:19:54 Twitch is busy and Helix has it and how quickly if you drive a car after the oil goes bad?
2216 2018-06-05 19:19:53 I’ll watch that tonight:)
2217 2018-06-05 19:19:47 I didn’t even notice that. I guess when you mix the beans properly the oil will disappear

A: Hot Dogs.
Congrats to Alicia! She wins a Big Brand Tire & Service Oil Change + tickets to Los Lonely Boys 7/19 at Libbey Bowl in Ojai.
2220 2018-06-05 19:19:30 Iv heard you’re meant to cut the onion in half, fork the domed end and dunk it in oil, and rub it on the grills, stops the meat sticking to the grills and flavours it 
2221 2018-06-05 19:19:26 wow I never actually realized that your so right
2222 2018-06-05 19:19:16 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2223 2018-06-05 19:18:59 excluding that war is actually trash on moral and humanitarian grounds.

war has excessive long-term cost that far outweigh any short-term hikes. example: cost of oil tends to increase which in turn increases manufacturing and product distribution costs that then hit consumers.

2226 2018-06-05 19:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2227 2018-06-05 19:18:40 can use the rosemary oil on a tissue  if not in the actual room! Shouldnt cause any issues with sensory in nose as the oil works on the limbic system in the brain anyway regardless if they can smell it or not.
2228 2018-06-05 19:18:30 This article fails to mention technological improvements in oil sand extraction which will make it cheaper and cleaner to extract.Even if the bottom falls out of the price of oil Canadians will be self sufficient in oil with our production from our Canadian oil sands.
2229 2018-06-05 19:18:25 Eastern Canada is already forced to buy Saudi Arabia and Venezuela oil and coal instead of Canadian. 
Not to mention it's brought in by ship, not a safe pipeline..

Russia can implement an emergency increase in oil-product export duties if needed

2232 2018-06-05 19:18:15 Wow #indiehour that’s a lotta carrot to shift
2233 2018-06-05 19:18:14 Eastleigh is the official home of all contraband goods.I'm not surprised with the sugar and cooking oil siezed from a store in the area
2234 2018-06-05 19:18:11 Banning Fracking is another issue that I fear is not broadly popular here. There are folks in this district that make good money off oil and gas and we do not have the drilling other places have.

2237 2018-06-05 19:18:08 There is a great documentary on Netflix called @SustainableDoc that looks how farmers work cooperatively in order to get their goods to markets. A great watch. It's all about #SmallBiz and food. #Indiehour #coops
2238 2018-06-05 19:18:03 Exploring oil and gas is just using nature's bounty. It's like harvesting crops or mining metals. 

It's necessity for progress of civilization.
2239 2018-06-05 19:17:57 For hard core day traders there is an after hours OIL event every Tuesday 4:30pm ET. API Weekly Inventory. Just like EIA Weekly Inventory, but after hours. I'm going to WATCH today, don't normally trade this. Set reminder?
2240 2018-06-05 19:17:44 Idea 229 : Fractional distillation of oil creates petrol, diesel and all the other petroleum products. Likewise have a way for disintegrating soil from different places to extract sand, clay etc.

2245 2018-06-05 19:17:15 Fellow,  Nigerians let's give this Nasser a parcel of land or an oil block...
2246 2018-06-05 19:17:10 Exactly! Add in Olive oil, even the smallest generic bottle is $4-$5 plus "spices", past $11 at point, definitely
2247 2018-06-05 19:17:09 Who wants to watch me drink beer and change the oil in my Jeep? 
2248 2018-06-05 19:17:06 Fantastic! Maybe the Saudis ran out of oil last year and have just been selling on other countries production until they can  sell out 5% of Aramco for world record trillions then shut up shop and retire!
2249 2018-06-05 19:17:06 Efficiency test for new oil separator plant: inlet hydrocarbons 4250 mg/l, outlet hydrocarbons <0,1 mg/l! Great result!!! #boerpiudicosi di @BoerGroup #water #WaterReuse #wastewater #wastewatertreatment

2251 2018-06-05 19:16:53 Yes, it's one big friendly game of monopoly. I sometimes get the feeling that stuff like NFLX and AMZN are a joke. Like that one guy back in the day  (working for conagra I think) who pushed oil over 100 just because he could.

2255 2018-06-05 19:16:40 Trukana oil should not only be beneficial to its environs population  but to all Kenyans at large,Oil is natural resource that it's ownership should only fall to the government of Kenya. It's benefits should be by all Kenyans not few private developers.

2265 2018-06-05 19:15:49 Hmmmm not good but I do use the grease in other dishes in place of olive oil... spaghetti peas and bacon... sauté onions in the bacon grease and break up crispy bacon out in spaghetti along with the peas it's yummy
2266 2018-06-05 19:15:49 The Great Fire was more popular in London than this snake oil seller.
2267 2018-06-05 19:15:43 There should have been no doubt a drop in US investment furingbthe same time frame of oil prices falling. However, their energy sector is booming currently compared to ours which is floundering. We are sending rigs down there and taking no crews. Unprecedented
2268 2018-06-05 19:15:42 Color probably depends on how much oil you cook with.
2269 2018-06-05 19:15:39 We have a policy against buying palm oil associated w/ deforestation & have a grievance process in place to investigate these claims and take appropriate action. Our grievance progress has already resulted in the removal of one supplier from our supply chain.

2272 2018-06-05 19:15:22 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
2273 2018-06-05 19:15:14 Do you pay for the oil?
2274 2018-06-05 19:15:11 That's because he isn't a leader, hasn't been since the election. We're now under Globalist Rule. He's just they're front boy acting as a curtain to shield them. He follows all their orders. They completely control him, our oil. our dollar value, & big business.
2275 2018-06-05 19:15:09 Fatigue could be sensory overload and the body shutting off.  So reduce surroundings that overwhelm. Use rosemary essential oil for focus and clarity  in room. Helps them to remember too. Set a timed task with clear motor plan, all will want to win and will compete!!
2276 2018-06-05 19:15:08 yall does castor oil really work/help with regrowing ur eyebrows
2277 2018-06-05 19:14:54 No one believes. More snake oil from the #snakeoilmafia
2278 2018-06-05 19:14:39 We will become just like Nigeria we'll have oil for export and non for domestic consumption.
2279 2018-06-05 19:14:36 That's because they wield the power in this union. If they got nothing from it, they would allow us to have our vote & let US decide what we want. It's purely about oil, whisky, gin, and all the other resources we have, that they want. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING MORE.
2280 2018-06-05 19:14:32 I'd rather not have a president trying to start wars that destabilize oil producing regions.
2281 2018-06-05 19:14:30 that's pretty cool
2282 2018-06-05 19:14:29 If anyone is looking for a great tanning oil for this summer @bali_body watermelon tanning oil is literally magic
2283 2018-06-05 19:14:26 These so called “local” markets price out locals so it’s only mass commercial market traders that can afford it. Same as the big food festivals #indiehour I dead to think the cost of a Royal Welsh stall for a week 
2284 2018-06-05 19:14:26 Whipping cream and flour. That’s it and the oil from the pan.
2285 2018-06-05 19:14:11 Yeah it does I mixed it with coconut oil & used it on my eyelashes after ripping them out  and my eyelashes are back to normal I used it for like a week
2286 2018-06-05 19:14:05 Tea tree oil is literally the greatest thing to ever happen to my face
2287 2018-06-05 19:13:57 Visit Tulsa (a convention and visitors bureau) successfully secured funding from non-traditional tourism partners like oil companies for tourism promotion. Interesting approach. #CNPAmericas18
2288 2018-06-05 19:13:53 Saw a little profit taking going into the oil close.
2289 2018-06-05 19:13:53 $80 oil changes
2290 2018-06-05 19:13:49 Or the fact that eastern Canada still burns oil for heat.

2306 2018-06-05 19:12:07 Doug Ford has promised to reduce gas prices by 11 cents.  
Q- he won't regulate private business, so he won't force the oil companies to do it.  He can lift gas taxes, but what's to prevent Big Oil from saying "Thank you sir!", then pocketing the excess profits?  # Doug Ford
2307 2018-06-05 19:12:02 So what you're saying is that anything Obama did for 8yrs is over on 1/20/17 as soon as PDJT took the oath of office? Like the Iran nuke deal? The Paris Accord on climate? The countless acres Obama admin grabbed/designated federal lands? Off shore oil drilling bans? ObamaCare?
2308 2018-06-05 19:11:53 Then why use palm oil in your product?

2310 2018-06-05 19:11:37 You have no comment on the suitability of the research method used in this study. Do you think interviews is an appropriate (and scientifically acceptable) way to measure cabin contamination / oil leakage in aircraft?

2317 2018-06-05 19:10:55 Sure, if you allow +/- 8 months error margin as any good snake oil salesman. My product will help you lose two pounds a week but you have to also work hard for it to have any effect.
2318 2018-06-05 19:10:55 If only the oil companies, and the banks, and the #MSM, then maybe it would be reported. In the meantime purchase an upgraded water filter.

2325 2018-06-05 19:09:57 That’s a great solution. We were talking on #indiehour a few weeks back that, that co-op system would be good for high street shops that are too large for small business but the big boys don’t wanna be in a town. Take the Zaks site in blackwood it’s 30k a year plus rates
2326 2018-06-05 19:09:54 Those are exactly the 4 nutbags that would top my list. Though I hate @DrOz the most. That festering boil on the taint of medicine knows exactly what he's doing selling this snake oil and knows it harms people yet continues to do it to line his pockets.

2333 2018-06-05 19:08:40 Sir, use of this portal will be revolutionary for our PSUs. They need it. I can say that from my yrs of experience in Schlumberger. 
We want to contribute this portal towards newindia2022 vision of PM. I have heard you in various oil events, feel that you can help us.
2334 2018-06-05 19:08:40 Burning oil drums for street lamps. Aesthetically stimulating. 

Would suggest to local council but supect the environment argument would win out. 

And safety.

And probably other things.
2335 2018-06-05 19:08:22 It’s cool for you. You didn’t do any of the hard work to rebuild the economy since the last crisis, b/c you were in the minority.

2348 2018-06-05 19:06:35 A crooked snake oil salesman!
2349 2018-06-05 19:06:27 Water, the new oil.
2350 2018-06-05 19:06:24 Favorite part of dropping off Gris (my car) for oil change/check up in Boyle heights is getting tons of fruits and veggies from street vendors  AND giving big side eye to them gentrifiers taking up space  #SupportStreetVendors #FightDisplacement
2351 2018-06-05 19:06:21 Yep! Wallet raided, but now have working brakes. I have spare oil/anti freeze and will bring a few litres of water on back up. Other than packing, we're good to go.
2352 2018-06-05 19:06:20 U.S. foreign policy is geared towards protecting America’s interests and U.S. jobs like all the other nations. As for oil, the U.S. is now self-sufficient in oil and the world’s demand for fossil fuel is declining! The good old days of oil boom are over which is a good thing!
2353 2018-06-05 19:06:18 Fish oil is good!
2354 2018-06-05 19:06:17 My baby car got an oil change and tire rotation and now happy and I'm broke lol.
2355 2018-06-05 19:06:08 it's because of all the oil fracking that Donald Trump is allowing to being done, it's causing vibrations and going deeper into the earth forcing the volcanoes to let all the lava out, a.k.a stop the oil fracking

Which option should I choose 
Bcoz question is not clear
2357 2018-06-05 19:05:58 It's like there is something wrong with your interpretation of words. Read about shale oil.
2358 2018-06-05 19:05:46 No doubt the oil and gas lobby is behind it.  We all know how the oil companies are suffering.
2359 2018-06-05 19:04:56 Capitalism is responsible for the destruction of Africa and the Middle East and for the extreme pollution of oceans, to name a few things. Only in a capitalist country, the Secretary of State could be bought by the oil industry.
2360 2018-06-05 19:04:52 Weird how oil comes out of the earth, like it was a natural product.
2361 2018-06-05 19:04:40 If u didn’t dilute it that might be why. You’re supposed to dilute tea tree oil with witch hazel or aloe Vera gel or sumn like that before applying because it is so potent
2362 2018-06-05 19:04:29 Recollecting an old article from @EconomicTimes in early 2004 which read about dismal financials of oil marketers like @IndianOilcl @BPCLimited  and @HPCL . As d govt policies changed,they became market darlings. Perceptions change,patience rewards. Is @ONGC_ awaiting its chance
2363 2018-06-05 19:04:12 I walked into a building and immediately was like “this smell is familiar...IT’S FISH OIL FROM PHO” and then a few min later I saw someone eating the pho from costco 
My olfactory system impresses myself
2364 2018-06-05 19:04:08 It’s the chilli flakes- you mix them with melted butter and oil for the sauce. They’re dark red in reality, they look darker in the picture.
2365 2018-06-05 19:03:40 Tea tree oil works gents. Soon my face is gonna be clearer than my conscience after cheating
2366 2018-06-05 19:03:20 That baby oil hack for fake tan does not work 
2367 2018-06-05 19:03:16 Other countries to America "y'all are selfish you guys only invade and kill and steal oil and resources". Then a tidal wave or volcano happen and it's "America pls help us :("

2369 2018-06-05 19:03:01 Well it may not be a major oil producer but still 25% of the states revenue. no American controlled Central Bank, no IMF debt, oil and pipelines. All the country’s you mention has Petro dollar written all over them. Bobby boy Syria invited Russia and Iran wtf are USA doing their
2370 2018-06-05 19:02:59 Real estate income, investing in oil fields, llc tax deductions on expenses, etc... it isnt just about gettin a job and working. The most important part is what to do with the money after.
2371 2018-06-05 19:02:58 According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Wicker has received over $200,000 from the oil and gas industry since 2012.[33]

2375 2018-06-05 19:02:34 I’m using vegetable oil to tan and my sister just said I’m like a sunny side up egg

2380 2018-06-05 19:01:40 Is anyone actually "playing" that they don't know gas prices have always fluctuated? Inane comments or delusional denial of easily verifiable stats or facts won't make you "right". Gas prices fluctuate, current price doesn't prove or disprove oil independence or dependence.
2381 2018-06-05 19:01:36 If anyone was a messiah it was Blair All style and no substance - a  snake oil salesman who blew into town with razzle dazzle and leaving you with a nasty taste in your mouth. Jeremy Corbyn is a humble ordinary and honest man and that's why you are so afraid of him Graham.

2402 2018-06-05 18:59:40 The world is using more oil everyday and the forecast is for that to continue until +\- 2050 & then the demand curve only starts to flatten. That is a pretty snail like pace of “moving away from fossil fuels”
2403 2018-06-05 18:59:39 The popular Shale that has nearly made Brent "useless" and turned US to Oil exporting country is WTI.

2406 2018-06-05 18:59:30 Ann. Listening to this I need to take a Xanax and I don't have any and it's too early to drink. Will fish oil work? She always feels the compulsion to disrespect April Ryan and it's infuriating!!
2407 2018-06-05 18:59:17 And you believe USA and Israel? Basically supporting their actions and genocide towards middle eastern countries and are known to continually lie through their tongues to reach their goal for oil and petrol in our rich Arab countries.

2413 2018-06-05 18:58:22 I like smelling like baby lotion/baby oil
2414 2018-06-05 18:58:15 AH, thanks so much @annfriedman and @aminatou - not only does this get me some great oil, but it's a reminded that I need to subscribe to The Bleed, like, yesterday.
2415 2018-06-05 18:58:08 Has fuck all to do with Pep and everything to do with oil money mate. Pep bought the players and they were already internationals when he arrived. Nobody became an international because of Pep so get off his length
2416 2018-06-05 18:57:56 I believe it to be true. Have heard of stories of miners digging for months only to give up and have someone else get the gold within a few metres. Also heard the story of Sweden and how they eventually discovered oil after many months when they were almost giving up.
2417 2018-06-05 18:57:56 Conventional wells used to recover 25% to 35% of oil in field. Recovery from tight oil (fracked) fields only about 9% with goal of 15% ultimately, said Clarke of @WoodMackenzie at @EIAgov conf. Ingram of @Halliburton sounded like he agreed.
2418 2018-06-05 18:57:55 Thank you @amazon for reinstating my account again for the 9th time for jus buying some coconut oil

2420 2018-06-05 18:57:01 He acts like a hotshot to the American people but grovels to his boss who should mean nothing to him. Putin will realize this has been a miserable failure, hasn't lifted the sanctions hasn't increased oil sales kinda like what he's done for us, nothing!!

2422 2018-06-05 18:56:24 It's not bro
 
WTI used to be more expensive because of the cost of production. They're found in oil wells in landlocked area while Brent are produced near sea.
2423 2018-06-05 18:56:14 Essential oil diffusers are supposed to help you relax but it just nauseates me :-(

2433 2018-06-05 18:55:20 $FSLR Oil is rebounding and market reversed.  Short sellers should cover their position soon.
2434 2018-06-05 18:55:14 I believe @OFTEC could look at promoting this as well. Thermal stores with Solar thermal work well with oil backup. Better option than the one currently on the table which OFTEC are fighting
2435 2018-06-05 18:55:12 Oil can go back to 70 and ng can go back to 3+ with the ratio falling....doesn't mean ng is a short
2436 2018-06-05 18:55:11 Could be you are right. What about oilers' penchant for very early goals and other bad timing goals like the end of a period and end of game. These aren't always bad goals by your definition of 'stoppable' but oil must have led nhl in bad timing and 1st of game goals.
2437 2018-06-05 18:54:58 Coming up this evening:

Between oil prices, trade wars and jobs reports the economy is being pulled in many directions these days.

2443 2018-06-05 18:54:20 We are yet to see if the oil will improve kenyan economy
2444 2018-06-05 18:54:12 $WTI +4% $6.66 LONG Gulf of Mexico oil and gas is grossly undervalued.
2445 2018-06-05 18:54:07 Just crushed a 1.2 lb. pork tenderloin. This stuff BEYOND underrated and way cheaper than most meats.

800 calories, 140g protein (), and ZERO carbs. Slather in olive oil and season with cracked black pepper, all-spice, and paprika. 

Admittedly I threw on a bit of A.1.


2446 2018-06-05 18:53:58 You don't know, I don't know. It's a problem for the planet. And there's too many vested interests producing gas and oil to make yet more plastic cos it makes them and their shareholders £££$$$€€€$$$$

2451 2018-06-05 18:53:28 The Oil petrodollar was done as a way of life 50 years ago and should be questioned in full...all politicians for the last 50 years or more are complicit....the other is a political stunt today with a partisan political agenda...the two have zero to do with each other...
2452 2018-06-05 18:53:26 I will look it up. Deeks started around S1E14. Anna after the oil tanker did not show up til after S7E14, but I will find the EXACT episode to hopefully put an end to speculation, not being offensive 
2453 2018-06-05 18:53:18 Oil? Oil is liquid, malleable. His heart is more likely made of stone. Or cement.

2457 2018-06-05 18:53:06 Do any oil painters or portrait photographers wanna date me?
2458 2018-06-05 18:53:03 
2459 2018-06-05 18:53:01 We certainly need an alternative to oil really fast. The exposure to oil for poor economies is just too much and unsustainable. And the OPEC behave like a mafia if they choose to.
2460 2018-06-05 18:52:54 I feel like a lil bitch when i pay to get an oil change

2468 2018-06-05 18:52:04 The Govt has GOT to cut DoD funding in a safe/smart way. Also, if we sell American Oil the funds should go directly to SS/Medicare for like 10yrs to replace what they took
2469 2018-06-05 18:51:58 Lulz.  Oil conspicuously absent from that chart, neckbeard.  Because its subsidies would dwarf all others.

2479 2018-06-05 18:50:57 Is having an essential oil diffuser for my car a sign that I'm an organized adult that cares about her smellscape or a cry for help?
2480 2018-06-05 18:50:53 Oil is a move
2481 2018-06-05 18:50:51 What is the difference between medical marijuana and CBD oil? I know that CBD oil does not get you high yet is useful in treating mind and body ailments.
2482 2018-06-05 18:50:51 interesting she wants cabinet or was it whole of government to approve abolishing single use bags but just a few decided on the oil/gas exploration decision.
2483 2018-06-05 18:50:39 Sadly too many people find it morally wrong to give kids cannabis oil, even though it doesn’t get them high. It’s sad because so many kids deserve better, but their parents are too hung up on it being cannabis. Damn shame.

2486 2018-06-05 18:50:12 you can spray a vinegar and water solution around the yard, or you can dissolve 10-15 drops of lavender or eucalyptus oil in a cup of water to spray the yard, as well. You will need to spray these periodically to keep the cats out.
2487 2018-06-05 18:49:58 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President,

2489 2018-06-05 18:49:37 Instead of peels, you can use sprays that have citrus scents. You can also dissolve citrus essential oils and spray it around your garden. Simply dissolve 10-15 drops of oil in a cup of water, and place it in a spray bottle.
2490 2018-06-05 18:49:34 A7. Instead of using butter, I use olive oil #JuneDairyMonth
2491 2018-06-05 18:49:33 A7. Olive oil instead of butter, almond milk instead of regular milk!  #junedairymonth
2492 2018-06-05 18:49:22 We do love wild limes, but this isn’t one of our flavors! Are you referring to our Avocado Oil Chili Lime chips?

2494 2018-06-05 18:49:08 Not gonna lie, this made me laugh, so its automatically the BEST chapter in the thrilling “Balor vs. The baby oil” saga.
2495 2018-06-05 18:49:07 Are we still importing oil?  If so, why?
2496 2018-06-05 18:49:05 mom bought a fucking vape pen for THC oil and now i feel like she’s cooler than me.
2497 2018-06-05 18:49:00 Kenya will export crude oil to middle East and use the proceeds to subsidize the cost of importing the same product back to Kenya. Madness in HD

2501 2018-06-05 18:48:35 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
2502 2018-06-05 18:48:25 I commend you for getting out there in oil country!
2503 2018-06-05 18:48:15 Will #RBI hike #CRR rates tomorrow? Looks likely: 

#Inflation increased to 4.6% in April with crude basket at $71. Now at $76

Paying more for oil will increase #CAD

Rupee depreciation further flames inflation.
2504 2018-06-05 18:48:03 Please ask Rudy Giuliani to quit doing interviews with different answers than what press sec. Sarah Sanders has given. He's late in the game and is making things difficult for her and also answering things incorrectly from what have already been said. Makes things look shady.

2509 2018-06-05 18:47:06 Additionally, processed plastics made with oil are used in heart valves and other esoteric medical equipment. Petrochemicals are used in radiological dyes and films, intravenous tubing, syringes, and oxygen masks.
2510 2018-06-05 18:47:00 It is arrogant to assume folk have a lower IQ because you believe your knowledge to be superior.  Everyone cannot read everything that has ever been written re Indy or the oil industry 1/2
2511 2018-06-05 18:46:52 The Trump administration has quietly asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production by about 1 million barrels a day, enough to offset expected oil export declines as a result of Trump's renewed embargo on Tehran.
2512 2018-06-05 18:46:50 Frozen sautéed in olive oil with salt and garlic is my favorite right now.

2518 2018-06-05 18:46:22 Dr Michaelis' study revealed that engine bearings depend on low rate oil seal leakage for lubrication, which explains cabin air contamination. Funny how you don't take issue with the findings, just with procedure

2521 2018-06-05 18:46:09 Yank here too. Wikipedia: Salad cream is a creamy, pale yellow condiment based on an emulsion of 25–50 % oil in water, emulsified by egg yolk, acidulated by spirit vinegar. may include other ingredients such as sugar, mustard, salt, thickener, spices, flavouring and colouring.
2522 2018-06-05 18:45:58 and we should believe you why exactly Doug? 
Is it because you've always been such a fine upstanding man? I think not.....
I've never trusted you and rank you with your idol Trump both as bottom feeders, con men, snake oil salesmen, crooks and liars, 2 of a kind.

2537 2018-06-05 18:44:06 I don't deserve special treatment, neither do you. We both deserve equal protection under the law.
2538 2018-06-05 18:44:05 I’m confused with this tea tree oil crap, which oneeeee there’s too many
2539 2018-06-05 18:44:01 WSK first look at country production relying on oil related sources then look at the financial side of the country and the budget being presented to cop the oil price hikes. Then look at the demand and ∆ in demand due to season. Then compare this theory.1/2
2540 2018-06-05 18:43:55 Could you imagine us being energy independent? That would be awesome. Idk how that would play into OPEC though, they may switch to having China supply their security in exchange for only selling oil in Chinese currency.
2541 2018-06-05 18:43:48 Nah.
2542 2018-06-05 18:43:41 Plz correct me If I’m wrong, Mengo rec oil is around 8 mbbls that worth $160m based on $20/b ground value. Current m/c is just £14m, rest do the maths, Mengo 60% CoS
2543 2018-06-05 18:43:39 This number is ridiculously wrong. Perhaps you meant TOTAL US OIL PRODUCTION, not exports. US oil exports are only about 16% of your claimed number. Get your facts straight, please. Don't spread falsehoods, you lose credibility by doing so.
2544 2018-06-05 18:43:32 Close the barn door, daddy, there's something I have to tell you, about a highly sensitive green-eyed ESFJ oil heiress, confidently tearing the seams of a powder blue sweater, indolently transforming her understanding of a chestnut Belgian Warmblood horse.

2548 2018-06-05 18:43:08 I thought that was the start, but could be wrong. Only know it was about the oil tankers and Arkady. Callen was still with Joelle until Xmas of S7.
2549 2018-06-05 18:43:06 Stop using the word foreign, thats a rude word to use on human beings. Again I repeat, oil is foreign to water it doesn't mix, these are people like you and me. Another example is poison is foreign to you body it will kill you, eyi SA black people are colonised mentally
2550 2018-06-05 18:43:00 Businesses that can profitably shrink:

4. Oil/Material Majors

2553 2018-06-05 18:42:43 ...and the Dems should be working to invest in renewable energy instead of propping up Big Oil. They AREN'T.
2554 2018-06-05 18:42:39 Good! As we reduce oil consumption clean the oil lines not used & connect Flood zones to run water to Areas in need of H20-Decades of Temporary use of US Lands for Pipe Lines & Profit w/out paying for the "use" of Land should cover the Cost of Pipelines 4R Future H20 needs-TicToc

2567 2018-06-05 18:40:50 Norway uses almost nothing of its own oil and gas and UK is the biggest buyer because we use a vast amount of our own plus imports. It's arguable that revenue would be smaller if NS production was in public ownership

2582 2018-06-05 18:39:15 Oil revenues are volatile and at the moment there wouldn't be much 'collateral' to raise much money. Government borrowing is usually done by issuing bonds and gilts, which needs a central bank or other form of security

2589 2018-06-05 18:38:19 $RTI. Some added thoughts...

1)  they extract for the tabacco big boys
2)  they profit with Oil
3)  double profit on the nitcotine extraction to be used else where (vape, etc)
2590 2018-06-05 18:38:12 Except oil companies know they can rip people off and blame others for it. And they do. Guarentee they will fill the gap themselves in the price of gas and they will keep the profit.

2591 2018-06-05 18:38:10 This is a nice quote. And I'm happy to say that - after years of trying to fall in love with Feynman's activity, some of them spent in Feynman's place - I've fallen in love! With oil painting. Feels so good.
2592 2018-06-05 18:38:04 This is all about "confidence" for you but that does not change cash flow. Those refunds are dollars going back to consumers and increase the pressure on the bottom line. This isn't a pro oil position, this is reality, something to which you seem allergic.

2611 2018-06-05 18:36:01 the USA has mastered dependency on oil imports and I see this as positive sign, removing power from unstable or destabilizing exporting countries, having ample resources. How compares that to steel and aluminum imports? Protection against liberal democracies?
2612 2018-06-05 18:35:53 It is crap. They cook everything in peanut oil making it incredibly unfriendly for a large amount of people
2613 2018-06-05 18:35:50 All Pruitt's grabbing everything he can while in DC makes me wonder how much of a kickback he is getting from land, timber, oil, gas, developers, and other interests as he dismantles the agency (created by a Republican--Nixon)
2614 2018-06-05 18:35:33 And that's Virden Oil Capitals

2616 2018-06-05 18:35:25 An enlightening facial mask, sparkling cobalt blue, with seaweed, jojoba oil, and exfoliating Dead Sea minerals. The flask it comes in is rusty tin.
2617 2018-06-05 18:35:21 Well just in my business which is oil and gas, our clients won’t allow Chinese steel to be used because of its subpar integrity however other business allow it which drives American steel out of business.
2618 2018-06-05 18:35:18 @K24Tv oil export
Yes, Kenya's oil exportation is readily prepared for
2619 2018-06-05 18:35:15 I’m baking banana bread too  using honey and coconut oil...hope it turns out okay! Yours looks delicious 
2620 2018-06-05 18:34:53 Georgia doesn't have "medical marijuana" for anything at all.  There are a very few conditions eligible for low-THC oil, a long waiting list to get into that heavily regulated program, and even the oil cannot be legally obtained because of the ban on in-state cultivation.
2621 2018-06-05 18:34:49 True to an extent but the size of the Scottish economy is much smaller than rUK (despite possibility of getting higher GDP p/capita).
Better to float our own coin, then balance the value rising due to oil, exports etc by using selective QU (not into banks but increases spending)
2622 2018-06-05 18:34:42 Time for another Oil change

2624 2018-06-05 18:34:21 rosemary oil is so stinky. smells like really strong mentholatum. but if it keeps my hair from falling out, I’ll deal with it. 

bought a few different “home remedies” off Amazon last night. all stuff that has proven to help alopecia. I’m keeping my hair, damn it.
2625 2018-06-05 18:34:21 Audrey Davis at work kids in school dogs sleep..... and I’m off I’m literally miserable I just been doing dumb ass stuff I went to kfc and done bought 12 cookies....drove down the street to get a oil change and forgot I’m in a rental car smh Lord help me
2626 2018-06-05 18:34:19 We can thank the cruise ship industry.oil and gas industry and our military fleets all our responsible for this.there midnite trash dumps the last 50 years
2627 2018-06-05 18:34:15 it's basically just potatoes, salt, vinegar, oil of some type, pepper, diced red bell pepper, diced red onion, and some chopped italian parsley
2628 2018-06-05 18:34:07 Russiaطs Energy minister Novak reiterates OPEC+ countries should consider a possible easing of oil output restrictions depending on demand conditions
2629 2018-06-05 18:34:05 Weird that you guys have absolutely nothing to say about the administration plan to prioritize coal & nuclear at expense of oil, gas, renewables. Don't you "support ALL energy forms" & oppose "politically motivated efforts" to prioritize some forms over others?
2630 2018-06-05 18:34:02 A hockey tradition sure to never end ..... from the land of the Oil .... GO CAPS!!!!
2631 2018-06-05 18:34:00 Been using wild growth oil for a while now & it’s amazing
2632 2018-06-05 18:34:00 @SSJWHB as I know you are a father of two daughters that will someday be driving I feel it is my duty to inform you that when they say “The genie lamp came on in the car”that means the LOW OIL LIGHT is on!

2636 2018-06-05 18:33:44 War for oil  is the handout
2637 2018-06-05 18:33:40 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
2638 2018-06-05 18:33:17 You may not like facts, but that doesn’t mean they’re incorrect. It means you’re incorrect when disputing them.
I ride my bike 10 mos. a year and drive an electric car on rainy days so I’m pretty immune to Trump/Putin increasing crude oil costs. Sorry you’re not. Blame Trump.
2639 2018-06-05 18:33:11 John kept up all paperwork detail stuff. When your working on Oil Refineries it high stress. Big time
2640 2018-06-05 18:33:07 Yes my hubby is an arable farmer and I make cold pressed rape seed oil and honey got to work with what you've got !
2641 2018-06-05 18:33:05 Remember dems poking fun at @SarahPalinUSA   for "drill baby drill"? Luckily, US oil cos ignored dems, and drilled,   or we'd be paying $6,$7,$8 a gal for gasoline. So next time you only  pay  $3 for gas, thank US oil, Pres Trump, Gov Palin, among others

2645 2018-06-05 18:32:46 "What do you do?"
"Oil and gas surface waste management regulation."
"Ooooh. So what's really going on with fracking and global warming?"
"...Landfills. I review landfill designs."
2646 2018-06-05 18:32:42 I think you're misinformed. The U.S. drills 10.4 million barrels of oil a day, a record. But it has done nothing to shield us from price surges. Because we use 20M barrels of oil a day, we have to import 40 percent of what we need. How does that put America first?
2647 2018-06-05 18:32:39 I recommend the 12 in 1 shampoo that also functions as motor oil and drano
2648 2018-06-05 18:32:38 I just remembered that I didn't use oil, I used spray sa di dreads. It's oily so I thought ke oil.

2658 2018-06-05 18:32:10 For years DT has written his own narrative and peddled it to people.  What a shame that #cult45 are suckers enough to believe his rambling ever changing nonsense.  Those that know him well are wise to this fact, while the snake oil consumers follow him blindly off the cliff. Sad!
2659 2018-06-05 18:31:58 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
2660 2018-06-05 18:31:54 The common shareholders of big media, the bomb makers, big oil & big banks benefit from war.

2688 2018-06-05 18:27:36 The Liverpool fans complaining about this and making petitions for bans and matches replayed. Need to have a fucking word with themselves. We got beat. Take our oil. Move on ffs. This is beyond embarrassing now!!

2692 2018-06-05 18:27:15 People won't forget the strong words followed by duplicitous actions. @Conservatives were gifted a chance to rise up out of the swamp yet they wriggled & squirmed muddying the waters further until they sank out of political consciousness. Leaving only an oil stain for an epitaph.
2693 2018-06-05 18:27:01 Drake is pulling out his white face/Jewish Card and taking him into court. Its a TKO for me. J.Prince should be quiet, the worst thing drake could say about Pusha T is that his braids need Jojoba oil.
2694 2018-06-05 18:26:55 @charliekirk11 IN ORDER TO REDUCE GAS PRICES IN THE U.S.A. THE OIL COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD MORE REFINERIES!!! FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN OFFER A TAX INCENTIVE TO GET THOSE WEALTHY OIL COMPANIES BUILDING REFINERIES!!!

2698 2018-06-05 18:26:16 @DavidHKoch It has come to my attention you have cancer, prostate to be exact. Use castor oil. Take a swig. May make your stomach feel uneasy so you should ingest a small amount of peeled ginger to relieve that reaction. Also apply a castor oil poultice to the affected area.
2699 2018-06-05 18:26:13 The Anstruther chippy is astoundingly good, and I am 99% certain the chips were cooked in veg oil when we went.
2700 2018-06-05 18:25:51 It's fine if you're an oil industry lobbyist. I'm not out to bash scientists. I just want people to think rationally and realize that PGV fracking on the Hilina Slump and having Kilauea lava fissures sprout all around PGVs front door are not two completely unrelated things.
2701 2018-06-05 18:25:42 @NewLeafCoopShop hi there! Do you carry cooking oil (veg, olive, any) that can be decanted into a reuseable glass jar?? Oh and same with @EcoverUK washing up liquid? Thanks
2702 2018-06-05 18:25:38 there’s a person selling cbd oil near me! Ya know the shit that has all the same benefits as weed without the high. 

I’m a little curious to try it out to see if I fein for the high or if this shit actually calms my anxiety and eases up the postpartum. 
2703 2018-06-05 18:25:26 Or oil. 
2704 2018-06-05 18:25:14 I refuse to believe that they go in depth enough to make it a problem with the intake manifold. It's more like the oil cap put back on or headlight fluid needing filled

2714 2018-06-05 18:24:06 You're a complete schmuck.  The stat you are referencing above is the export of petroleum PRODUCTS (the end result after we refine all of the oil we import and produce domestically).  We still import WAY more crude than we export.
2715 2018-06-05 18:24:04 a concept: my empty bottle of cbd oil and me, now with some sort of hummingbird like beak struggling to get the last drops

Mushrooms, kale/spinach, onion, bell peppers, feta and Parmesan. Dress it up however you want. Lol. 
Ramen:
Build up a good broth however you want but add sesame oil and soy sauce for the Asian flavor. Once it’s boiling add all your toppings 
2723 2018-06-05 18:23:09 I think partially cuz people want to use food as fuel now, instead of using Oil & Gas. When corn and hemp crops take over... other things we want to grow to eat will become more expensive. I just saw PB for $8 for a small jar.
2724 2018-06-05 18:23:06 I am! Lifelong exerciser. One of my most read articles is about snake oil in the fitness industry!

2728 2018-06-05 18:22:40 What?  First if the US occupied Iran doesn't that mean oil in Iran is under US control?  Not sure how that would lead to higher gas prices?
2729 2018-06-05 18:22:39 I’m those guys in love live cosplay trying to dance on oil trying to get thru my gym workout while blasting snow halation rn
2730 2018-06-05 18:22:29 oh okay then you’re goood. you got a toyota too that shit can have no oil and you’ll still be good lol
2731 2018-06-05 18:22:12 You're welcome! But, no heat. It extracts the properties (which is why we use hot water/oil in preparations.) Some herbs are  so delicate, like chamomile that even using too hot of water for an infusion will cause the properties to evaporate -you'll have flavor & nothing else.
2732 2018-06-05 18:22:12 Communism is a nefarious ideology, perpetuated by murder and resentment. It is responsible for massacres and atrocities committed by Marxist thugs like Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Kim Il-sung and et al.?
2733 2018-06-05 18:22:06 No. It’s about ripping up the Iran deal. Read about where all of our oil comes from! Look at the gas prices in California.
2734 2018-06-05 18:21:53 Also stop peddling the income tax payers are the ones paying government.  Indirect taxes like excise duties on imported oil and GST constitute major revenue of gov. Even a beggar who buy a candle pays that indirect tax.
2735 2018-06-05 18:21:51 How on earth can we be so stupid as to continue doing this? Little wonder that Texas Big Oil loves us. Like any spoilt child enough is never enough.
2736 2018-06-05 18:21:40 Ss set up an experiment to find the most effective ways to clean up oil spills, and are now crafting PSAs about the negative impact on the environment from the perspectives of fisherman, scientists, animals, etc. Can't wait to see their final products using @WeVideo #inspire203

2740 2018-06-05 18:21:16 Sorry Catherine, your actions say "Oil profits are everything. I don't care what affected Canadians say. I only hear oil executives". Your Govt has literally spent $0 to fight climate change. As a life long liberal voter, I cant wait to vote this party out of office
2741 2018-06-05 18:21:12 Now if we can just get the gas back down to living levels of around $2.20.9, I can live with it...Problem is,  gas stations are pricing up without getting any fuel which I think is wrong..when oil comes down, it takes forever for gas prices to come down....total price gouging!!

2743 2018-06-05 18:21:00 Nope just notice a decent amount of oil and dust around head during a regular service.  Our John deere rep did not warranty because it was outside the 2 year warranty. Contacted corporate and they had our rep come check it out might get a new engine now.

2745 2018-06-05 18:20:19 @simonmayo @jowhiley @bbcradio2
The 'Love Island' conversation profoundly illustrates the gulf between your broadcasting styles... Which like oil and water never will mix. I'm DEFINITELY with Simon on that one!

2746 2018-06-05 18:20:01 @foodwishes What is your preferred method to get crispy wings in the oven?  You show three techniques, par-boil, baking powder, and flour/oil spray.  Please don't say par-boil, cause that's too much work!
2747 2018-06-05 18:19:57 It seems that way because you’re not familiar with all the snake oil in sports and athletics. It’s the same thing. Writing coaching can be invaluable, as much it can be worthless.
2748 2018-06-05 18:19:56 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2749 2018-06-05 18:19:55 .. dismantle the epa. You aay you're against the deep state, well wouldn't a major oil exec with ties to energy lobbies that buy politicians be someone you wanna see go?
2750 2018-06-05 18:19:46 I was literally just playing DankRp on Gmod and I found robokast after I went to get a snack and he was being kidnapped and I was just standing there while he was getting killed by a kidnapper and the base was "Oil Something Squad" I wished I saved him tho I didn't rec it tho :(

2752 2018-06-05 18:19:35 Yeah my mom and I can't stand fish in general, but we marinate salmon in lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, dill, and parsley (if it doesn't taste like soap for you lol). Really helps.
2753 2018-06-05 18:19:17 2/2 you are also paying through the Horigan government through the courts to halt the Alberta plan to stop sending oil to BC    Sheesh !!!!  what's it going to be.....

2757 2018-06-05 18:18:46 Ya that's my moderately conservative estimate, I've been quoted $60-$120, but mine is new so fewer maintenance items. Gas is 8GPH @ $5.00/gal, so $40, the rest is wear & tear, oil, and mandatory 2200hr engine overhaul.
2758 2018-06-05 18:18:45 Very memorable- first and only oil painting of Satan I have ever been given! I'll take a picture and post it, it's great- you still paint?
2759 2018-06-05 18:18:44 Forcing Abrdeen residents and Oil & Gas industry CEO's to fly to London before they are permitted/able to travel to the outside world may be in BritNat Bowies interests but it is certainly not helpful to any of the people in Abersdeen.
2760 2018-06-05 18:18:32 Great discussion.  health begins with what you put in your mouth.  Vegan, plant based (no meat, dairy added oil) prevents heart disease, obesity, diabetes, arthritis, and many more.  It is cheap, easy and should promoted everywhere to reduce health care costs.

2764 2018-06-05 18:18:07 At All American Towing, we also service domestic and foreign vehicles. If you are in need of an oil change, brake repair, new tires, or something more, we will provide superior workmanship at affordable prices!
2765 2018-06-05 18:17:58 Weaker pound (see Brexit stories about weaker DFI passim), slowing economy and hence weaker demand unlikely to be good for offshore oil. Also: it's a simple story about numbers, which can't be gainsayed.
2766 2018-06-05 18:17:45 at least i have kale chips. (aldis had a bunch of kale on sale and if you salt oil and bake it until it's junk food it's pretty good.)
2767 2018-06-05 18:17:38 Also read that it’s a tuners responsibility to check oil levels now? Where they do that at?
2768 2018-06-05 18:17:33 The oil hungry business man should never have been appointed in the first place. The US should be the leaders in preserving the environment but instead we are reverting back to the industrial age
2769 2018-06-05 18:17:14 "Oil exports now exceed 10.4 million barrels a day

Total nonsense!

2772 2018-06-05 18:16:49 I wouldn’t suggest taking a child off his meds but people must make their own decisions. Eg. I used oil of camphor on my children’s chests when they had a heavy cold, to help them breathe. It works. (That’s what Vick’s contains so we found out later.)
2773 2018-06-05 18:16:44 Socialist policy in Venezuela (or the U.S.) takes power away from an extreme right of Robert Buchanan economics of Randian capitalism. In Venezuela's case, socialism defeats U.S. regime change there which brings austerity and takes natural resources (oil), & controls banking.

2775 2018-06-05 18:16:30 My husband, nearly 20 yrs as a B2B and now brand marketer at a large oil company and was today learning to add rainbow  writing to his Instagram story at Facebook. The worm has turned folks.

2777 2018-06-05 18:16:05 Smothered in coconut oil.greasy as a bag of chips but at least I smell good.
2778 2018-06-05 18:15:56 Everything we do is putting pressure on some species, somewhere, to adapt, evolve... from antibiotics to massive oil spills in the ocean to dumping plastic all over everything everywhere... to cleaning. Darwin FTW!
2779 2018-06-05 18:15:48 I watched Don Quixote last night, for my first time. 

Here’s a very interesting quote.

“The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.”
2780 2018-06-05 18:15:39 Lower tax does not mean lower price. The oil companies will pocket the 10c/ litre as excess profits.
2781 2018-06-05 18:15:39 Return of the oil rig @PatterGOD
2782 2018-06-05 18:15:35 Oooookay, definitely time to move the yellow kitchen cleaner very far away from the olive oil
2783 2018-06-05 18:15:29 But....plants make oil?!?
2784 2018-06-05 18:15:03 I remember my Ford wagon in the 80's driving down highway 1.  I don't even remember the song, just remember my blooper lyric.  I sang it myself.  "Motor Oil, m' car just can't get enough Motor Oil". Anyone remember the tune?
2785 2018-06-05 18:14:40 I've been working for weeks on a rebuttal of the Center for NYC Neighborhoods report that flippers are bottom-feeders who jack up prices (with legislation to impose a tax on them). None will talk to me, so I have no story- and yet they can advertise snake oil like what you saw.
2786 2018-06-05 18:14:39 Massaging your head while applying oil on hair is the best feeling . i am already sleepy
2787 2018-06-05 18:14:35 Mark, why would you equate the liberals with morals? They are like water and oil.
2788 2018-06-05 18:14:23 Or better I would say 'the odds are less likely for stocks falling' - correlation oil vs equity is a statistical  fact not an opinion
2789 2018-06-05 18:14:02 Can I deep fry that with olive oil?

2829 2018-06-05 18:09:49 Ok. Here is a thought I had: what if those bidding up properties in cities also have exposure to gas and oil, thus receive a discount for their inner city mansions by all the driving the workers have to do by moving away?

2841 2018-06-05 18:08:12 Are you suggesting that the labour and capital employed to produce tea is more entitled to its product than the labour and capital applied to oil industry, tourism services in the Mara, or fishing in Lake Victoria?

2874 2018-06-05 18:05:36 OIL is swinging today , there is pause  in american market assessing trade situations , italy . I am seeing metal index up through not very much but in green . Dollar is down a bit
2875 2018-06-05 18:05:35 So now he's helping steal Syria's oil for Israel so they can be energy independent too.
2876 2018-06-05 18:05:21 Chris Long has got his head on straight. He donated his entire year's salary to charity. I dare anyone... pharma CEO, Big Oil exec, Betsy DeVos, The Koch Brothers, Steven Mnuchin, etc. to do the same. And that ain't gonna happen anytime soon.
2877 2018-06-05 18:05:06 In eastern Canada our fuel is bought from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela while our liberal government is killing oil production in Canada and not letting it get to market or even Canadians while we import fuel from other countries

2896 2018-06-05 18:02:04 Refuse plastic but spend as much oil as you can in wars around the worl. Disaster in Irak and Syria with the home made refineries. Are we going to talk about it?
2897 2018-06-05 18:02:01 Why govt. have not increased  ethenol prices which oil companies buy from sugar mills. It could have saved our foreign exchange & it would also have developed manufacturing ecosystem (Jobs, Capital goods, Logistics etc.)
2898 2018-06-05 18:01:37 Disaster!!  
I admit i am gun shy on nuclear because of fukushima, but in Alberta (canadian province) we have 2-3 cent per kWH.   Our combined cycle nat gas generators are competitive with  coal now.  
We were looking at plants to turn that coal into diesel, but 120$ oil is gone

2929 2018-06-05 17:57:19 Yes we did. Saddam was also cia appointed and he became a problem when he wanted to ditch the petrodollar. Same with ghaddaffi, and assad in syria has no IMF debt and wants to do the same about oil, so he is a problem too.
2930 2018-06-05 17:57:18 What about the oil corps secret science? They knew what harm their products would do to the air and earth and never shared the knowledge let alone the science behind it.

2941 2018-06-05 17:55:32 It is around 43% that goes to EU states. I think Holland is our main destination - probably ports. If we take our whole production (excluding the oil and the gas) they claim UK is around 61% (though that is a muddle as some stuff could be transited on) EU is 17% and ROW is 23%.

2969 2018-06-05 17:52:39 After hitting a 3-year high a little less than 2 weeks ago, the oil price has tumbled nearly 10 percent and things may be set to get worse as Saudi Arabia and Russia prepare to boost output.

2972 2018-06-05 17:52:05 We have been energy independent for several years now. The natural gas industry helped with reliance on foreign oil. That couple with additional drilling by the Obama led to this years ago. It also put “maximum pressure” on Russia as oil prices dropped. But hey, facts.

3007 2018-06-05 17:47:59 Trump wouldn't admit that. The only time information is volunteered is when Trump thinks it's something to brag about. What's the rest of the story? Putin wants to sell more oil and natural gas, and Trump wants to help him in exchange for what?
3008 2018-06-05 17:47:58 So, I'm waiting at the car lot while my wife's car's oil gets changed and this 60-year-old woman looks at me and the man to my left and woman to my right. She then precedes to ask them if they're my parents and who dropped this kid off. 

Like I'm 26, Ethel. I'm an adult.
3009 2018-06-05 17:47:54 Sorry to hear. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for my neck pain. It works for me. It works with your body naturally to heal without side effects. 
3010 2018-06-05 17:47:52 Might not be a separate plastic lobby but the oil lobby as it is the main ingredient in making plastic
3011 2018-06-05 17:47:52 Does cocconut oil really work? I currently have about 10 bites, short of turning myself into a giant rash from deet etc I’m looking for something sensitive skin friendly that works.
3012 2018-06-05 17:47:47 Gangsters and the internet don't mix. It's like oil and water. You brag in real life about the crime you do and nobody would know about it until you use social media to put it out to the world and then you fighting 20 years. Real Gangsta's don't post crimes.
3013 2018-06-05 17:47:27 Why am I up here in the dealership letting these folks up sale me?? I came for a oil change. Now I’m getting extra stuff 
3014 2018-06-05 17:47:22 Nigeria does not need oil. I wish we could get rid of it and start again. It’s really holding us back
3015 2018-06-05 17:47:21 At first fitspos were peddling lousy supplements, now its CBD oil while they using a fallacious argument to lead people. Be better
3016 2018-06-05 17:47:19 Battled a cockroach in my restroom and now there's baby oil, toilet paper, and shampoo everywhere

Albert Einstein: Well..

Aliens: ..well what? 

Einstein: Well..

They are overpopulated,
Running out of oil and gas,
Still believe in god,
Destroying the planet,
All this & more yet they choose to watch some eye cancer called #LoveIsland
3021 2018-06-05 17:47:05 and it wouldn’t matter if they had all knelt at every game....the issue is america elected a blathering bigot of a snake oil salesman as its president, and are too embarrassed to admit they were wrong
3022 2018-06-05 17:46:44 Why are you even bothered about a party headed by a moron who wears diapers & massages his dainty fingers with Johnsons baby oil

These are the lil efforts we appreciate as men.
3027 2018-06-05 17:46:22 Its much easier to remove plastic garbadge from our beaches & waterways than dirty tar sands oil. Please do not continue to support the very environmentally unsound Trans Mountain Pipeline.
3028 2018-06-05 17:46:19 So do I cause I check the oil sometimes
3029 2018-06-05 17:46:16 Fell asleep in the waiting room at Merchant tire, waiting for my oil to get changed. That’s where my life is at right now 
3030 2018-06-05 17:46:15 Record fuel price increase takes effect from midnight in South Africa. The increase are is result of the weaker Rand and rising international oil prices.

3032 2018-06-05 17:45:59 I looked it up. It's all about telling people how sick and evil they are in order to sell a snake oil cure.
3033 2018-06-05 17:45:54 just mixed up the essential oil blend to finish the day lemon & tangerine bc citrus = energizing
3034 2018-06-05 17:45:22 Oga Go ahead Mel ima begin impeachment naw.All this nah crammed.

By the way as of today
Current price of oil is $65 per barrel.
Not $80..
Vote of confidence Ko
Vote of incompetence Ni.
3035 2018-06-05 17:45:16 I am all for supporting Indies but when you literally pour something easily available (like caster oil etc) into your own bottles and charge 3-4x the price, you lose my business
3036 2018-06-05 17:45:15 Sorry to hear that. I have used @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for my neck pain. It works for me. There are no side effects. It’s organic, natural, works with your body to heal. 
3037 2018-06-05 17:45:09 DAWG I TOOK MY CAR TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AND THEY STRIPPED MY OIL PAN LMAO
3038 2018-06-05 17:44:59 Wait until the oil barons decide to use another currency for their oil pricing and then watch your gas bills rise.
3039 2018-06-05 17:44:55 And playing the media is leading to splitting this country. Our country is in term oil over his “playing”!
3040 2018-06-05 17:44:49 Even if oil revenues are ring-fenced (unlikely to happen in .Ke) govt would still borrow against future oil revenues. If $2b cannot be accounted for by GoK, anything is possible
3041 2018-06-05 17:44:46 @BeckyFairbairn1 Canada can do very well without oil, it’s only a SMALL portion of our overall economy. ‘Grinch’ about something factual.
3042 2018-06-05 17:44:44 Hallå wtf! Åh, är Oil slick och en setting spray kvar?!
3043 2018-06-05 17:44:39 I hate getting oil changes because there’s so many little steps and I get confused v easily
3044 2018-06-05 17:44:30 Sure it will with more Alberta money. Get Energy East back on the table and stop the crooked Quebec politicians from taking money under the table for other countries for their oil including the US
3045 2018-06-05 17:44:29 Yes, most women are so sweet, caring, and loving. No need for lust, revenge, jealousy, avarice...no. Women are robots. Perfect robots.
3046 2018-06-05 17:43:41 The oil companies lower and raise their prices daily. $0.10 knocked off of a liter per gas will always be $0.10 knocked off the leader of gas. So instead of paying $0.40 in taxes per liter for gas, we will now pay $0.30 in taxes per liter for gas. Smart conservative policy.
3047 2018-06-05 17:43:29 Why is it that it is the pro-petroleum people who are locked in an all or nothing mind set and can't seem to understand the concept that weaning off oil starts with not expanding production?
3048 2018-06-05 17:43:20 LOL Antonio Ramón Villaraigosa is pure snake oil.
3049 2018-06-05 17:42:37 Lmaoo
3050 2018-06-05 17:42:34 If we all work together through the Paris Accord, then we can make the change from oil to green, sustainable energy & no one will lose their jobs. They will gain knowledge & respect for Mother Nature. This can’t be done overnight, but we can look forward to achieving it together.

3052 2018-06-05 17:42:16 Yukoner Drea Naysayer has toured all around Canada, Belgium, Denmark & The Netherlands. She is at the park from 12-1. Our weeklong visual artist Emma Barr, is oil panting during the performance.
3053 2018-06-05 17:41:58 I use a mixture of things, sometimes Miss Jessies, shea moisture, or As I am. I also use castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter. The only time my curl pattern is defined is when I don't put heat to it. As soon as i straighten it, my hair is damaged.
3054 2018-06-05 17:41:42 GoK can easily borrow against potential future revenues but they wont talk about it. Oil may be a driver for heavy borrowing even for future regimes.
3055 2018-06-05 17:41:41 I can see you are a big thinker Doug...NOT! Without oil companies there wouldn't be heating fuel, diesel for transports or gas for cars.
3056 2018-06-05 17:41:35 I gotta get the oil changed in my car
3057 2018-06-05 17:41:25 I’ve been telling Munoz imma go get an oil change since I got back from school nd I still haven’t gone

3063 2018-06-05 17:40:39 Governments are too money greedy #WorldEnvironmentDay and UK are discussing making another runway at #Heathrow they also stopped looking at sustainable power when oil was found in Scotland! We can power from tide but won't! Too little profit
3064 2018-06-05 17:40:25 I live in the Bay Area, the part with the oil refineries, across from where @gavinnewsom was mayor. You'd think gas would be good-n-cheap, but no, oddly, it's some of the most expensive in CA. Yet another reason I didn't vote for Slick Newsom.

3073 2018-06-05 17:39:35 I just spent my lunch break getting the oil in my MIL’s car changed — for the first time since she got sick a year ago.

It was a reminder to me all of the general maintenance items we let fall to the wayside when everything else is on fire. And that’s just the car.
3074 2018-06-05 17:39:34 What’s the facts behind this almond oil
3075 2018-06-05 17:39:23 Venezuela has oil, and there in lies the interest.
You don't really care about the people, Puerto Rico proves my point.
3076 2018-06-05 17:39:20 A5 coconut oil treatments! I do them weekly to help my damaged hair #DesertEssenceMom #Sweepstakes
3077 2018-06-05 17:39:19 This 'experiment' would be more accurate if you posted pictures of conventionally attractive dark-skinned women not covered in oil.
3078 2018-06-05 17:39:14 A5 I can’t live without oil! Coconut or macadamia #DesertEssenceMom #sweepstakes
3079 2018-06-05 17:39:08 now you get oil and no surprise instead
3080 2018-06-05 17:39:06 Tea tree oil. Love how it keeps my hair moisturized, healthy, and it’s helping it grow again after my big chop #DesertEssenceMom #sweepstakes
3081 2018-06-05 17:39:05 Tell them there is oil in the oceans. They'll soon start exploring
3082 2018-06-05 17:38:57 Coconut oil is too heavy of an oil and it clogs your pores. I wouldn’t advise you to put it on your face lol but almond oil or even Argan oil would be good
3083 2018-06-05 17:38:50 hmmm I can't say much 'cause I could sniff gasoline all day long, especially oil mixed with gas. GIMME THEM FUMES PAPI
3084 2018-06-05 17:38:50 I’ve been a stoner for more years than not. I’m proud and functional, what I don’t like is blatantly using in public, in Denver saw a guy at a sandwich shop on the patio with a full oil rig & a large torch, like for welding. It’s dangerous & rude my 2cents
3085 2018-06-05 17:38:49 Don't mind the moron defending this excuse-making administration. Next they'll tell too much rain is affecting Oil revenues.
3086 2018-06-05 17:38:44 I really know what you mean. Sorry to hear it. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for my neck pain. It works for me! No side effects.
3087 2018-06-05 17:38:35 Americans use 100 billion plastic bags per year, which requires 12 million barrels of oil to manufacture.
The average use of a single plastic bag is 12 minutes. 
It takes 500+ years for a plastic bag to degrade. #WorldEnvironmentDay #RejectSingleUsePlastic

3091 2018-06-05 17:38:19 Yeah I take about 125 milligrams a day for pain. It’s tough to do that vaping. vaping is great for people who suffer with anxiety and need a quick way to quickly take the edge off. For Pain management oil under the tongue or balm has worked best
3092 2018-06-05 17:38:14 Fired for collusion with Big Oil
3093 2018-06-05 17:38:12 We have fried food here. All that stuff/oil is used by cars in countries like Brazil.
3094 2018-06-05 17:38:08 Disagree we have seen no growth in the renewable energy so we will need oil for decades to come by the rate of change we are looking at another hundred years
3095 2018-06-05 17:38:05 Are you so ignorant that ypu don't know the price of gas has NOTHING to do with who is President!? It has everything to do with worldwide market price, supply and demand. - From an oil trader.
3096 2018-06-05 17:37:58 I overused coconut oil and now I slipping all over the place.
3097 2018-06-05 17:37:57 As naturally as I can. I had to do research on remedies. Between cannibus & black seed oil.

3107 2018-06-05 17:37:12 there is no doubt that #ISIS have acted in behalf of #Turkey so far. actually, #Erdogan provided #ISIS with weapons, money, free #Turkish passes, and have supported them by buying crude oil from them and letting them invest in his country
3108 2018-06-05 17:37:10 You ever go to just get an oil change, then end up having to call your dad cause they are speaking gibberish saying there’s a hundred more things wrong with my car that I didn’t know about

3113 2018-06-05 17:36:15 Why don't you expand your thinking? Eco initiatives are more profitable than oil. They are growing while the oil sector shrinks. Investing in green energy makes far more sense than investing in oil. Quit drinking the Liberal Koolaid.

I only started following him four days ago. 
However I see nothing wrong with him sharing ideas on Twitter.
I am not aware of him asking anyone for their money.
As of his Oil trade, I never took it as it did not make sense to me.

3136 2018-06-05 17:33:39 No. Sorry. Shale oil made the US independent and that started long before Trump. Are you really that desperate for attention that you’ll promote such a misrepresentation? Or are you really that uninformed? A little of both?
3137 2018-06-05 17:33:18 That’s 10.4 barrels of petroleum products, we still import way more crude oil than we produce. It just happens we refine crude and then export it in some cases. It’s embarrassing you are commenting without any knowledge on the subject.
3138 2018-06-05 17:33:12 Like buying Kodak when digital cameras were coming. Like investing in hats when JFK became president. Building a canal when railroads were on the way.  Whaling ships were a great  get rich quick investment before oil.
3139 2018-06-05 17:33:11 A3:  Apple, lemon, glycerin, olive oil, sugar cane, salt, coconut oil, and some other stuff.  No parabens.

3140 2018-06-05 17:33:07 Does your chart produce oil?
3141 2018-06-05 17:32:57 Just got back from Nigeria. R4.89 a litre, I know they have oil but still
3142 2018-06-05 17:32:33 #DesertEssenceMom one time I made my own  shampoo using castle soap and tea tree oil!  I really should do that again.
3143 2018-06-05 17:32:28 Right?

3145 2018-06-05 17:32:16 You listed basement examples for failed socialism:

Weimar Republic(not socialist) pegged currency to gold

Zimbabwe: one of the worlds poorest countries destroyed its currency by destroying its  own food infrastructure 

Venezuela: heavily reliant on oil revenues
3146 2018-06-05 17:32:11 What do you think the tough talk on Venezuela is about? Illiberal democracies? Really? When he is trying his darndest to create one here? It is about the oil. Iran is about the oil. Remember he said we should have taken Iraq’s oil fields. What are his EPA policies about? The oil.

3152 2018-06-05 17:31:28 IT was not safer. Not at all. It's happening now BUT 60 years ago it was far better. When the preceding Shah was nationalising oil and initiating social reforms.

3158 2018-06-05 17:31:03 Please quit lying to protect your oil interests. Thank you.
3159 2018-06-05 17:31:03 That’ll be a NO then. I find It’s always the humourless who resort to Ad Hominem. And do keep harping on about how stupid we are to have oil in our waters 
3160 2018-06-05 17:30:41 With rising gas prices and taxpayers also paying to subsidize the oil industry....we need alternative energy sources.
3161 2018-06-05 17:30:38 Crude Oil Price Forecast: Trump Pleads For OPEC To Boost ProductionAfter tweeting that OPEC was artificially creating higher prices, the US government is said to have requested a boost of nearly 1 million barrels per day sending prices low...
3162 2018-06-05 17:30:37 Rosemary essential oil works to keep spiders away. Just spray a little around all openings they can get in through. Bonus if your landlord hates the smell of essential oils 
3163 2018-06-05 17:30:35 You’re right about BIG. BIG mistake. Please do obstruct my beautiful view with an oil rig.

3166 2018-06-05 17:30:23 20 benefits of coconut oil:
#12. Prevents gum disease and tooth decay. By swishing the oil in your mouth, the oil denatures the bacteria and sticks to it. Removing oral bacteria greatly reduces your risk of periodontal disease.  #veganstrong

3171 2018-06-05 17:30:08 Pilates. I’d recommend adding #CBD Oil. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil. It works for my neck pain. I’m better than I have been for a while. #Healthy #NoSideEffects #Natural
3172 2018-06-05 17:29:42 Then, for the love of gasoline....lower the prices, already. I am so sick of these oil people getting fatter and fatter off of me. Every big holiday weekend gas prices go crazy high. Yes we have our crumbs, but these guys take it, because we want to travel.  To visit family.
3173 2018-06-05 17:29:38 Approx 90% or more of all soy grown is given to animals. So, if you're angry that soy is destroying the environment, stop eating animals.
Palm oil is destructive. Vegans know this. This isn't a vegan issue. This is a "stop using palm oil, everyone!" issue. #WorldEnvironmentDay
3174 2018-06-05 17:29:28 I still don't understand why no rich businessman would like to sponsor an army that will kick them off Venezuela, rebuild the country, and get even richer from the oil.

3177 2018-06-05 17:29:11 I like kale, just not for smoothies, it doesn't really blend well. You should try Kale chips, it's really nice! Little bit of olive oil and sea salt or any salt really, pop it in the oven, so tasty!!!
3178 2018-06-05 17:29:01 A3. I know there’s Argan oil...but not alllll of the things that are so fantastically rich in #DesertEssenceMom #sweepstakes

3180 2018-06-05 17:28:38 Coconut oil?
3181 2018-06-05 17:28:37 He believes we think Pro rel eliminates bad organizations when it specifically is a mechanism to process and refine those very things. Like saying "Oh so you guys believe in motor oil, so you're saying if I add oil there won't be any heat or friction??" No. Not at all.
3182 2018-06-05 17:28:37 Turned my car in 3 hours ago for a simple oil change and I'm STILL waiting to hear back from the dealership

3189 2018-06-05 17:28:21 My only oil tank story was having to pay for a company to "sweep the yard" for any decommissioned tanks. This, despite having done it already less than two years earlier when we bought the place and having certification that it had been removed. Silly...
3190 2018-06-05 17:28:20 Some of the most notable benefits of jojoba oil include its ability to moisturize the hair, prevent hair loss, reduce inflammation, prevent acne, soothe sunburn, rejuvenate the skin, eliminate dandruff.  Sounds like good stuff!  #DesertEssenceMom #sweepstakes

3193 2018-06-05 17:27:49 Woah!! I remember when I first heard of products with Jojoba Oil (yes I'm that old LOL)  #DesertEssenceMom #sweepstakes
3194 2018-06-05 17:27:44 Done. Just hope multiple candidates don't split the vote and give our tea party rep raking in millions from Big Pharma, Big Oil and the NRA a way to hang on. (I'm in one of the CA districts we're trying to swing)
3195 2018-06-05 17:27:43 France stocks #CAC 40 were lower after the close on Tuesday, as losses in the Financials, Utilities and Oil&Gas sectors led shares lower.
3196 2018-06-05 17:27:42 Why @10DowningStreet is it that when oil costs go down we are  told fule costs don't go down straight away due to they buy in advanced. But when oil prices go up fule gose up straight away. We are being riped off please investigate
3197 2018-06-05 17:27:41 Sir there r lot of scams,GDP islow,natural resources r running out,fuel and oil prices r all time high,poverty and unemployment is at top,army is not getting enough money, pollution is high so how just constructing onelordramtemple is going tosolve problems developed the country

3203 2018-06-05 17:27:01 3. Put in place on Iran the most restrictive sanctions ever put on a nation, driving them to accept a deal wherein they gave up their entire nuclear weapons development, permanently, in exchange for getting access to money they had already earned by selling oil.

3211 2018-06-05 17:26:23 while we flood what remains of indigenous land w/ oil & pour water in the desert & send children to pick its crops despite never knowing where the fruit of their labor will go. To the mouths of the self righteous who spend their energy condemning those who live off the land

3214 2018-06-05 17:26:05 Would have to get there first. When under sanctions, Iran was already sending oil for other currencies and gold. 

Just speculation.
3215 2018-06-05 17:26:04 Solution to all life problems ; coconut oil.
3216 2018-06-05 17:26:01 Maybe because China wants trade oil with CNY , that makes HW nervous. Free print has challenges now. I guess.
3217 2018-06-05 17:25:57 Petrol Prices are up - that’s how @BBCNews like to report Oil prices are up, they’ll spin it anyway they can other than say the price of a barrel of oil is up! #bbcbias #YouYesYet

3221 2018-06-05 17:25:39 Explain why Norway rakes in £18bn in revenues from Oil extraction, whilst the same year the UK gov is losing hundreds of millions for virtually the same oil in the same place.
The fundamental clue is that the UK gov has managed the industry since the beginning, not ScotGov...

3229 2018-06-05 17:24:33 You are not dealing in reality. The world will slowly move toward new energy.

3237 2018-06-05 17:23:35 I'll have to listen to the podcast (even though I don't drink much coffee). I'm curious as things such as neem, or cayenne or peppermint oil are also seen as insecticides.
3238 2018-06-05 17:23:27 Newsom and Vilar are empty sour face men. Newsom let the 49ers leave town. Vilar left LA in shambles. Both are trying to use the governorship as a stepping stone. Newsom’s father was lead counsel for Getty Oil. FYI

3241 2018-06-05 17:23:03 Like I need a “baby let me see your keys so I can take your car to get detailed” or “baby it’s time for an oil change” type of nigga.
3242 2018-06-05 17:23:01 IMO they are much closer to that than you think.  An EM ccy now resides in SDR basket, & can now print currency for oil.  Every passing day, China's position gets better on this front, & can serve as a regional anchor for others, using gold for offshore CNY settlement...
3243 2018-06-05 17:22:59 1. Reduced our dependence on foreign oil to the lowest point in 80 years. You may not be smart enough or informed enough to understand why that matters.
3244 2018-06-05 17:22:55 Trump/Eagles debacle is such a contrast to Obama presidency. After BP Oil Spill, I worked /w Obama WH to get Gulf community responders to WH to celebrate with @Saints in 2010. Folks set aside politics & pain of the spill to share a celebration.

3258 2018-06-05 17:21:25 Mealy bugs are the worst, but I've seen them mostly chew on soft wood and leaves.

You'll note I said the UK, not specifically Scotland, or the North Sea, or even the Oil & Gas resources: I was typing about the UK's entire assets, which Scotland, Wales, NI etc. helped amass.

3267 2018-06-05 17:20:53 WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT  TEXAS THAT THEY ARE ALLOWING TORTURE OF INNOCENT CHILDREN?  I AM A 10th GENERATION TEXAN AND I DEMAND THIS STOP MY GRANDPARENTS WOULD BE FURIOUS AT TEXAS.LETS NOT FORGET THAT THE OIL BUSINESS IS WHAT GOT US HERE
3268 2018-06-05 17:20:44 Give him a maxima oil kit
3269 2018-06-05 17:20:37 Safflower: chickadees, cardinals, titmice, finches, grosbeaks. Flickers prefer suet (you can buy it with pepper in it so squirrels will leave it alone) and black oil sunflower. Doves like millet & sunflower on the ground
3270 2018-06-05 17:20:26 And Qatar has a tiny population and enormous oil wealth, so will bounce back once the impact of regional sanctions has been overcome.
3271 2018-06-05 17:20:24 Mutual interest like oil and money laundering
3272 2018-06-05 17:20:24 Wicker is a tool of the oil industry and the NRA.  If you like pollution and no background checks for gun purchases then vote for Wicker.  If you want to protect our environment then vote for someone else. Wicker supported transporting guns on Amtrak, wacko; just ask the TSA.
3273 2018-06-05 17:20:19 Gotta get those oil prices down. Over $4/ gallon is hurting the pocket book.
3274 2018-06-05 17:20:16 Whoop! Me Mam n Dad have arrived from Spain..replenished my olives, cheese, oil & Rioja supply.. happy days 
3275 2018-06-05 17:20:12 I love mozarella and tomato grilled skewers with lots of basil oil
3276 2018-06-05 17:20:05 They HATE peppermint oil!
3277 2018-06-05 17:19:52 Make sure that your car always have clean oil and water before you hit to the road to reduce chances of engine breakdown

3279 2018-06-05 17:19:28 1-Cuando el Rockefeller Center se empezó a construir, en Buenos Aires el edificio Kavanahg ya existía.

Cuando la Standart Oil empezó a construir su primer kilómetro de oleoducto, YPF Argentina tenía 35 Km de oleoductos y 95 pozos para explorar.
3280 2018-06-05 17:19:18 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
3281 2018-06-05 17:19:13 Why does my office smell like I did an oil change in here?
3282 2018-06-05 17:19:09 Revive Energy East.   The majority of Canadians would favour powering Canada’s economy with Canadian, not Saudi oil !
3283 2018-06-05 17:19:09 My car is a pos. $200 just to get an oil change
3284 2018-06-05 17:18:40 ポストカードの在庫をどこにやったかわからない…アナログしなさ過ぎて……どこだ…
3285 2018-06-05 17:18:35 Jana put my career in a different perspective. She said something like “it’s true doctors are important they save lives blablabla countries go to war over land, oil and soon water too. It’s about money and managing money is your job” paraphrasing but it was something like that.
3286 2018-06-05 17:18:28 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
3287 2018-06-05 17:18:27 Waiting for my oil change to be done and this older guy in the waiting room legit asks me, “your phone takes pictures? How do you get the roll of film in there?”
3288 2018-06-05 17:18:20 getting an oil change in the summer sucks bc the 15 min you have to keep your car off is the worst #sweatybetty
3289 2018-06-05 17:18:05 My hair loves bentonite clay and @AussieHair their gel really works for my hair with my @manechoiceafr oil
3290 2018-06-05 17:17:55 WOW!  Just priced a competitors peppermint essential oil....they are 37% HIGHER than ours!  #BestPriced #ILoveValue 
3291 2018-06-05 17:17:52 WARREN: I don't mind lying to someone you love forever. I love this geek. I can give a fuck...
MAX: The more I burn the midnight oil the longer I take.
3292 2018-06-05 17:17:48 Dat oil bruh 
3293 2018-06-05 17:17:46 It’s possible it’s just whatever oil it’s suspended in.  Some use cottenseed, some sesame, they also have two different forms of injectable T, there are lots of variables ^^;
3294 2018-06-05 17:17:45 You'll drink anointing oil till you get married
3295 2018-06-05 17:17:43 Great, how about doing something to really help the economy (not greedy oil companies) build some refineries and lower the price of gas.
3296 2018-06-05 17:17:38 Of course. It works like a mf. I get the rosemary oil from now solutions. I haven’t done this in a long time but I’m about to do it today.
3297 2018-06-05 17:17:13 What a tiebreaker from these two men...fantastic stuff...must-watch television. #CecchinatoVsDjokovic
3298 2018-06-05 17:17:10 I’m not buying nobody body lava stick to my baby oil and trophy wife 
3299 2018-06-05 17:17:03 OMG brown butter is such a good idea.  My husband teases me for putting all sorts of things in plain tea/coffee - butter, coconut oil, cardamom, cinnamon, almond extract, salt...
3300 2018-06-05 17:17:00 For #oneplasticfreeday we're sharing some awesome #plasticfree brands to help you #passonplastic
@wasserneutral make bamboo toothbrushes with castor oil bristles, unlike most bamboo toothbrushes which still have nylon bristles.
In the UK you can buy them from @andkeepshop
3301 2018-06-05 17:16:59 I have not tried the #Oil #Capsules #Vape #Tagged @GregD1975
3302 2018-06-05 17:16:59 Time Americans took their country back from oil and coal barons.
3303 2018-06-05 17:16:51 coffee, oil diffuser on, and aphex twin. I’m in complete heaven right now
3304 2018-06-05 17:16:42 Especially since they claim they're for women's rights. They're only "for" abortion and we have to start calling them out on their hypocrisy and hate. The squeeky wheel gets the oil. We need to leave them behind and let them rust.
3305 2018-06-05 17:16:36 Why was Exxon trying to secure Putin’s oil? #REXRISING
3306 2018-06-05 17:16:30 Yea I can’t ...plus I use certain scrubs for that that leave an oil finish then I just use coconut oil
3307 2018-06-05 17:16:24  next time purchase the oil and filters and just have them do the labor; save some money
3308 2018-06-05 17:16:22 - Stopped to get my oil changed while I'm in the area 

Adulting is annoying
3309 2018-06-05 17:16:20 The US produces 2.25 times as much oil, and 4x as much NG, but has 14 times the financial subsidies as Canada.
3310 2018-06-05 17:16:05 Ways to spot the Californian  in your east coast office: 
1) Commits dress code crime of wearing jeans 2+ days in a row  
2) Repeatedly attempts to venture outside for lunch only to be foiled by weather 
3) Hides a handle of California Olive Oil in cubicle drawer 
3311 2018-06-05 17:15:52 Ah okay so OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES = I love every person inside?
3312 2018-06-05 17:15:43 Nakakatanggal siya ng oil sa mukha kaya dapat ka ng gumamit no'n, Kyah
3313 2018-06-05 17:15:38 using a rizla on my face to get rid of oil because im too broke to get actual blotting paper
3314 2018-06-05 17:15:37 OIL 1H just broke out above 65.31=50MA. This is a KEY break if it holds would signal bullish reversal pending. The 1D red reverse hammer overnight candle is now a GREEN HAMMER off trade this morning. No catalyst discovered for move higher. WATCH
3315 2018-06-05 17:15:10 10/10 would not recommend buying a house in Carlsbad mid oil boom 
3316 2018-06-05 17:15:00 Our hairlines don't agree
3317 2018-06-05 17:14:52 Tea tree oil baby
3318 2018-06-05 17:14:44 tastey face oil!
3319 2018-06-05 17:14:43 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
3320 2018-06-05 17:14:39 Now playing: Incubus - Oil And Water
3321 2018-06-05 17:14:38 @thehill Trump has a new title, stock market influencer. Trump announced tax cut, all Corporate America benefits, Trump admin requested OPEC oil production to increase, all US oil producers' stock prices go down.
3322 2018-06-05 17:14:33 Got a new oil named pink panties and it’s pretty good
3323 2018-06-05 17:14:28 It recommended drinking 2 ounces of virgin olive oil with 2 ounces of freshly squeezedlemon juice, wait five minutes and follow with 8 ounces of water. It said to drink this twice a day and to keep drinking plenty of water throughout the day.till you pass them I had a strainer.
3324 2018-06-05 17:14:00 My friend was torn between pride that her 5 year old had learned to speak French, and devastated that she was suddenly excluded from part of his life. That and his constant demands for foie gras and truffle oil on his fish fingers.
3325 2018-06-05 17:13:32 Morgan Stanley is positive on Reliance Industries as the brokerage moved up forecast for crude oil to $90 per barrel for 2019, and sees this raise as a big positive for the oil heavyweight.
3326 2018-06-05 17:13:29 #Crud oil high 4399 I told you definitely come 4400/- 
Mind it and still more ....

3328 2018-06-05 17:13:14 maybe he needs to strap it to his chest for when he goes to see his oil industry buddies and other lobbiests.....
3329 2018-06-05 17:12:45 Why are you tasting crude oil !!
3330 2018-06-05 17:12:38 When we were putting an addition onto our house, we had to have the oil tank relocated from under the ground to our garage. EPA was involved, and the few days until we got the "all-clear" ground testing results were unnerving.
3331 2018-06-05 17:12:35 Their vitamin e oil is fab!
3332 2018-06-05 17:12:09 Very interesting and thank you. Where do you apply the oil?
3333 2018-06-05 17:12:01 Same reason you change your cars oil. If the car is running, why change it? And most credible, scientific sources say fasting is bad. I’m sure you can find blogs by Joe Shmo saying it’s good. Idk you and don’t care what you do, but spreading harmful info is dangerous.
3334 2018-06-05 17:11:52 Does anyone really believe the 10c difference wont be made up by oil companies and they will profit off it instead of it being govt revenue.. sad
3335 2018-06-05 17:11:52 WOW!!!
3336 2018-06-05 17:11:35 I would do like a hair masque every week and start just using the argon oil everytime you wash your hair!
3337 2018-06-05 17:11:33 No, they weren't going to be treated as another Sideshow in Tweety Amin's Snake Oil Emporium & Extravaganza.
3338 2018-06-05 17:11:30 Yes! My family works in Oil and Gas! Excellent news!!
3339 2018-06-05 17:11:29 I need to try CBD oil. I hear it helps. I’ll have to see how much it is. I’m hoping they will pass medical marijuana.
3340 2018-06-05 17:11:19 This link is a American publication. 
They have tar sands. We have oil sands.
Try refering to and using Canadian content.
Good to know you rely on the country that is actively trying to keep our product landlocked.
3341 2018-06-05 17:11:11 The Right are the conspiracy theorists?
The Left believes in
-RussiaGate
-Melania is missing
-Terror attacks in Europe aren't large-scale
-Gun show loophole
-White supremacists control the US
-9/11 was faked for oil
etc
3342 2018-06-05 17:11:07 We pay 80% in tax on our fuel, why?  We can’t afford to run our cars, especially if you’re out in the sticks!  Yes crude oil and the exchange rate factor in, but 80% tax???
3343 2018-06-05 17:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: spicy crust with greasy motor oil and arugula.
3344 2018-06-05 17:11:06 What's up with the right hating money so much? They don't want to take orders from paying customers and when they do actually get money they give it away to snake oil salesmen like Alex Jones and mega preachers like Osteen.
3345 2018-06-05 17:10:54 I got a damn oil stain on my pillowcase 
3346 2018-06-05 17:10:40 There is no more an inefficient means of moving goods than to take individual wagon loads & equip each & every one with an internal combustion engine. It is obscene. great for oil companies & road builders though of course who 'sponsor' transport policy.
3347 2018-06-05 17:10:35 FYI magnesium is destroyed by your digestive tract. Better applied topologically via Magnesium oil.  I use everyday pre bedtime (assists sleep / immune response)
3348 2018-06-05 17:10:31 yes coz im working in public transport n infra n i observe these developments very carefully ... u can check fiscal deficit of 2010  to 2018.... strategic oil reserves ... eesl initiatives for led, super efficient ac, tubelights, fans, electric cars, indegenous solar panels etc.
3349 2018-06-05 17:10:30 and the champion in Novak comes out when it's needed most...bravo
3350 2018-06-05 17:10:18 The best way to know if you need fish oil is to get your omega levels tested. I work with a company that does blood tests for that. The other thing you can do is get your CRP levels tested
3351 2018-06-05 17:10:14 btw - a very good Twitter friend sent me Canadian cleaning products.  They are the BOMB!  They are organic and based in coconut oil  They do much better than say Mr Clean an leave no residue or smell.  Amazing stuff.

3353 2018-06-05 17:09:53  adding 2 drops of rosemary oil per oz of shampoo instantly thickens hair and can potentially stop / significantly slow down the process of thinning.
3354 2018-06-05 17:09:53 Met a very vocal climate change denier who said out loud he would be dead before we run out of oil, and therefore doesn't care. I alnost told him to die faster so we can fix his mess
3355 2018-06-05 17:09:51 Been using bio oil and moisturizer oh so faithfully and ya girls stretch marks have gotten sooo much lighter. 
3356 2018-06-05 17:09:49 No  Natamaan kase kaya lalong na maga then yung mismong earrings na natanggal. Try mo linisin lagi ng oil
3357 2018-06-05 17:09:43 and please discuss with them ..how to.control oil prices..we can definitely give new ideas
3358 2018-06-05 17:09:38 We’ve got all our country ways of getting them out without tick removers haha tea tree oil works a treat if Ollie ever gets any
3359 2018-06-05 17:09:36 Sen. Ernst, like Grassley, has figured out that Big Oil trumps Big Corn in this administration.

3370 2018-06-05 17:07:56 The stock price is down 55% over the last 5 years with no bottom in sight. MGT has made terrible decisions with the company's debt financing, did not nothing to leverage against the big oil price drop, also causing the dividend to be cut. Yet MGT still hires new people for big $$
3371 2018-06-05 17:07:51 The primary reason why I like to spend a little extra and paint everything in oil based/ gloss paint. Keeps the maintenance down. xP
3372 2018-06-05 17:07:51 Provoke the bureaucratic crooks to decriminalize CBD oil from hemp today, not next year or the year after !
3373 2018-06-05 17:07:29 Galak bener baby oil.
3374 2018-06-05 17:07:28 Interesting data point: cars are on the road for 10-15 years, providing an incentive for oil production in Canada #RIACon18 #FossilFuels
3375 2018-06-05 17:07:27 Then why are we importing oil??
3376 2018-06-05 17:07:27 Just another idiot who has ZERO knowledge of the oil sands, and surprise surprise he’s from Ontario, and most likely still lives with mommy, I bet she didn’t give permission for him being on twitter either
3377 2018-06-05 17:07:14 I understand west tx the oil field n all but why the FUCK everything gotta be so damn expensive

3380 2018-06-05 17:07:02 Reported this account for its tweet content. “Boil in Oil?”  Not cool.
3381 2018-06-05 17:06:58 Yeah, it does matter.
Oil and gas prices are published.
They are not some mystical numbers people make up unless they rely on politicians and RT.
3382 2018-06-05 17:06:57 Damn cooking oil yangu yapera . I don't know what I will eat tonight. Mwari ndioneiwo
3383 2018-06-05 17:06:46 It's floaty, true. Maybe spinach in an omelette. Business idea: omelettes for every LC diet school, everything pre-cut. Unzip, fry in provided high quality coconut oil with a dash of MCTs.
3384 2018-06-05 17:06:34 Fried snails ... women catch the snails, they’re fried with flour and olive oil and then doused with wine. Personally, I’d stick with the salad.

3386 2018-06-05 17:06:12 I'm sure there could be (divesting from oil; better/more/better-funded social programmes as @MetaCatie says), but I don't really know, and I tend to be pessimistic about all that.
3387 2018-06-05 17:06:06 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

Proverbs 5:3-5
3388 2018-06-05 17:06:03 YPF junto a DAPSA se quedó con la operación de OIL Combustibles. Lo decidió el juez Javier Cosentino, quien el 11 de mayo había decretado la quiebra de la empresa por no pagar $8.000 millones en impuestos al combustible (con los intereses, esa cifra supera los $21.000 millones).
3389 2018-06-05 17:06:00 4.5 Billion for an oil pipeline, Yet how many Reserves & People across Canada & Alberta STILL do not have SAFE drinking water? Good move. The Court challenges & delays will see our Billions of tax dollars for this flushed down the toilet as it's stalled in court for years.
3390 2018-06-05 17:05:56 #DavidKoch announced today that he's retiring in order to have more time to volunteer for the causes he most supports: taking candy from babies, laughing at disabled people in public, 
and making sure oil has more rights than any living species on the planet.
3391 2018-06-05 17:05:54 That, a map of domestic gas, water, electricity and oil pipelines. What's wrong with you that you have to try and mislead people all of the time?
3392 2018-06-05 17:05:51 Ur no oil painting yourself hun
3393 2018-06-05 17:05:41 Ever moisturize your scalp with castor oil and it just drip down your neck all day? 
3394 2018-06-05 17:05:35 But we need to accept that the month on month increases on fuel price is influenced by external forces like oil price and forex (except for one month in a year where the government increases fuel levies such as Road Accident Fund and general fuel levy for maintaining roads).

3396 2018-06-05 17:05:03 God given? Mmm... Wonder why in the hell God didn't give You more oil so You don't have to screw the Middle East? Got some words for God...
3397 2018-06-05 17:04:20 We an oil drilling nation, an increase in oil price is equally good news...we fucking increase in revenue as well ...so if they are not as insensitive as the past government, they can subsidize for us!

3404 2018-06-05 17:03:23 It’ll likely go down especially when we crack local refining of oil but definitely not to that rate of 160, that rate wasn’t real...We’ll need to start serious manufacturing & exports to get that
3405 2018-06-05 17:03:20 total money grab. we had a 7 year ordeal because there were a few drops of oil found. ugghhh

3452 2018-06-05 16:58:09 Happy to hear that, but if we are exporting so much oil, why are gasoline prices continually rising. While California has been a gas rip off for many years, prices are rising, nationwide!

3466 2018-06-05 16:56:03 Pretty much, yeah. I live in a province which had a conservative government for 40 years, and voted in an NDP government a few years ago. Nothing has really changed here except the NDP adopted the rabid support of an environmentally-damaging and anti-Indigenous oil project.

3532 2018-06-05 16:48:13 One thing I don’t like about using body oil regularly is that it changes the structure/texture of my skin
3533 2018-06-05 16:48:06 Commodity currencies such as the loonie, kiwi and Aussie tumbled as oil declined for the fourth day in a row - BBG
3534 2018-06-05 16:48:00 at the pool and some random guy asked me to rub tanning oil on his back and I’m v uncomfortable so I’m gonna keep sippin my beer
3535 2018-06-05 16:47:50 A ridiculous claim.  What might help the oil and gas industry is a longer runway at Aberdeen capable of taking heavy lift aircraft so we could export more hardware.
3536 2018-06-05 16:47:36 Not even in a Mediterranean tabouli salad with essence of truffle oil?
3537 2018-06-05 16:47:10 What is pathetic is people believing a swim suit is the best way to measure a woman or SHOW. Good Bye Miss America, Hello 21st Century!

3538 2018-06-05 16:46:52 caster oil. i use it and it helps with the scarring and overall just calms down the irritation. i recommend.
3539 2018-06-05 16:46:36 How do you do your pre poo? Do you just lather it all up with the cocunut oil
3540 2018-06-05 16:46:30 About time too. Hopefully will be followed by a ban on advertising this and all the other snake oil out there.
3541 2018-06-05 16:46:29 The spike back up on oil I believe is also related to the USDCAD reacting off a daily supply zone
3542 2018-06-05 16:46:16 Liz Earle on my face, bubble bath, oil diffuser on and salt lamp on, fresh jammies and bedding. Anxiety I’m gonna kick ur ass 
3543 2018-06-05 16:46:16 Apologies for the capitals, that was a typo. Sorry but Trump is NMO the second comin of Christ, his a Globalist slave of the Bankers and the MNC´s, Big Oil and Israel, hardly an American First Nationalist that got him elected NOT more Neo Conservatism.
3544 2018-06-05 16:46:15 Oil exports now exceed 10.4 million barrels a day 

Trump has successfully made us energy independent for the first time ever

3546 2018-06-05 16:45:54 Please build up a refinary plan and it will cut down the cost of oil, create job to miliion of youths... nothing to be smile here if we're exporting crude oil and import again
3547 2018-06-05 16:45:51 When has Bernie ever compromised? Listen, I'm sorry you got sold some snake oil. It happens, but what I don't understand is how you don't see it two years later? Bernie's a fraud. No worse, he's being used to divide the Party, & hurt it's candidates. Sad!
3548 2018-06-05 16:45:42 word my dude. I got bud for days so don`t need to worry about that. Only thing is making my own oil time consuming sometimes. But totally worth is

Do me a favor and hit your polls today

I'd like my original state to be choosin' decent policies, see.

3552 2018-06-05 16:45:08 How to control oil on face ??? Pls tell

3560 2018-06-05 16:43:41 talking about Thailand which doesnt even has 5% of oil royalties but the combination of all light rail/ tram projects across Thailand plus the ongoing HSR, expansion of metro in Bkk are enough to beat our LRT network. 60km Phuket LRT Suburban-urban, ChiangMai 41km,KKaen18km&more
3561 2018-06-05 16:43:41 I get so mad when I order something and it shows up and I can smell truffle oil emanating off it
3562 2018-06-05 16:43:28 With all due respect sir, these are the same excuses oil companies for years use whenever they want to raise prices.
3563 2018-06-05 16:43:26 You can fight against the Fuel levies but the basic fuel price or the price of fuel at refinery gate is influenced entirely by international oil prices and the exchange rate.
3564 2018-06-05 16:43:18 Oil prices are still high what else could we expect, we are paying debts that other people took to their bank accounts. Fucked up as hell
3565 2018-06-05 16:43:16 Lol, myself, id go to dollar store and get tin pans and drizzle and roll it in, and then throw that mess out when finished lol. 
At $5 - $30 a moon rock, its way cheaper making it urself. Save your kief, buy or make oil, either way ya gotta buy bud, unless ya grow ur own lol
3566 2018-06-05 16:43:09 1. Get a spare key made for your car.

2. Go to Walmart, get four new tires, an oil change, etc. Give them the key you just had made.

3. Wait till it’s done and they call your name on the intercom. Walk out the front entrance, use your normal keys, drive away.
3567 2018-06-05 16:43:08 Ok, but real truffle oil- yea or nay?
3568 2018-06-05 16:42:54 Miraa is expensive in meru, fish is expensive in kisumu, oil.......
3569 2018-06-05 16:42:45 What type of oil do y’all use on your faces?  i use jojoba but i think i might switch
3570 2018-06-05 16:42:45 In case you were under any illusions over how much of a middle-class wanker I really am, I now have two separate pots of coconut oil on the go.  One for me and one for my rats.  What have I become?
3571 2018-06-05 16:42:37 that’s unfortunate. i drive a saturn it can run off vegetable oil
3572 2018-06-05 16:42:36 In the next few weeks, Some people some where will just create a shortage of the counterfeit sugar and cooking oil seized in Eastleigh and in no time the goods will find their way in the market. Sigh! This is Kenya people 
3573 2018-06-05 16:42:34 Cleansing oil >>>>> cleansing water >>>>> makeup wipe  and please PLEASE do double cleansing it’s not a hassel it’s selfcare. U go to sleep w the thought of dirts still in your pores?
3574 2018-06-05 16:42:30 I hear that... but my big sis had glitter on, not oil... it didn’t even satisfy the experiment requirements and she used it anyway... how you tryna defend black women by dragging another black woman? She muted herself....

3584 2018-06-05 16:41:45 while he sat in the car??  Then got out n went n the store n told her to check the oil?...  Nothing I guess
3585 2018-06-05 16:41:37 I'm constantly dodging oil changes and usually only get them when I do hit 10,000 and nothing's happened yet. I also drive a Prius because I care about the environment (aka don't want to spend a lot of money on gas).

I guess I'm just #blessedT #andalsohighlyfavored
3586 2018-06-05 16:41:12 Are you using facial products with oil in them? That was my issue until I cut it out. Cetaphil is a great cleanser. I also only use one pillow for my face and change it in 4 or 5 days and got rid of any makeup sponges. I’m also a germaphobe. So.. idk if that’s just me

3596 2018-06-05 16:40:27 I don’t think there’s a very large depreciation on Indian Rupee as it dangles around 65+_3 almost from 2012. While crude oil price gone from 120 to 40 and now on 80s ... so !!!!

3598 2018-06-05 16:40:24 Won’t be here tomorrow. Today is it for Jones Elementary. But you could take my car to get my oil changed or take my Apple watch to get the protector replaced and get one for yours while you’re at it. #ErrandRunnerNeeded

3600 2018-06-05 16:40:19 Mexico imports more semiconductors than crude oil by value, and the government is not happy about the price increases.
3601 2018-06-05 16:40:16 To be fair, we love oil, whiskey and smoked salmon so fair point. The only flaw in the plan is that it means Brussels’ incompetent parliament will be telling you what to do rather than UKs.
3602 2018-06-05 16:40:15 Made an appt to get my oil changed at noon... I’m still waiting.

3604 2018-06-05 16:39:55 Went and took mom to the dr got a oil change done and now home in a nice cold house with AC
3605 2018-06-05 16:39:46 And the price of gasoline is approaching 3 dollars a gallon on average,we need to balance exports with cost increases to Americans,holding the price of oil high by exporting our home production is putting the screws on Americans.
3606 2018-06-05 16:39:44 just realized that I hate olives but love olive OIL due to subtle american propaganda #StayWoke
3607 2018-06-05 16:39:36 I think we’re already seeing the implications in oil production. It would take time for new investments in oil to pay off, and I don’t think oil producers are forecasting long enough payback periods. Hence, investments in new oil production are likely starting to wind down.
3608 2018-06-05 16:39:36 Hypocrite! You are endorsing the pipeline..plastic comes from oil..how do look at your children when you are destroying their future.

3614 2018-06-05 16:38:42 I live in an area now (Permian Basin Oil Field) that is boom and bust. The area swells with workers when oil drilling is up, as it is now. Much of the local economy benefits and locals who want jobs have jobs. The downsides are increased crime and high rents.

3621 2018-06-05 16:37:11 I did, that's why I asked. Nowhere does it say 100k jobs will be cut. The 100k reference is to how many people work in the automotive sector. That's like saying once Trudeau was elected all the jobs in Oil & Gas was going to be cut. Totally a reach

3638 2018-06-05 16:34:57 My 2015 Jeep Cherokee goes from 120kmh to full shutdown including no power steering in one second.  Dealers solution: change oil 2000km before oil needs to be changed. Slightly dirty oil makes the Jeep a Jack-in-the-box-of-death.

Good luck on your purchase.
3639 2018-06-05 16:34:55 something organic and moisturizing. no perfume. if you have dry skin try sesame oil. but its mostly an internal gut thing so look into pre/probiotic and fiber rich foods and eating less meat  hope that helps

3667 2018-06-05 16:31:58 I'm with you on that. But if we don't count on FORIEGN oil, and we have plenty. Why did gas go up .70 cents a gallon. If the Oil Barrons of the Middle East can't control our production, what is controlling the PRICE. Are we still tied to the GLOBAL MARKET FOR PRICING?
3668 2018-06-05 16:31:51 and it works OK if you have ooodles of oil and gas, a gigantic sovereign wealth fund (which we could have had but BLEW IT as usual) and only the population of Oldham to feed dunnit???

3670 2018-06-05 16:31:46 After working all day at the conflict factory, where we deal in discovery disputes and fight over privilege logs, the last thing I want to do when I come home is get into a row with the car repair shop about my oil change and tire rotation.

3689 2018-06-05 16:30:09 The narrative that Canada heavily subsidizes Oil and Gas has been disproven repeatedly. Even in coming up with that paltry number there was an error. CDE and CCE are not subsidies, they are depreciation. Every industry that has tangible assets depreciates them.
3690 2018-06-05 16:30:07 I’m just not sure I understand if we are pumping out more oil than ever before why have the gas prices skyrocketed? Seems the supply is not an issue.

I also know American Oil production has outstripped Russian and really hurt Russia’s economy.
I also remember we killed a bunch of Russians in Syria.

3704 2018-06-05 16:28:51 Oil is a globally traded commodity and things that happen outside the country affect the price of oil here, even if we make our own.  We still import millions of barrels a day.

A：正気ではなかった
3735 2018-06-05 16:25:15 They were separate. I don't think avo oil is considered an industrial seed oil, but imo it tastes gross lol. I much prefer the bacon fat one. I also want to try just regular pork fat, because the bacon one had a bit of a smokey bacon flavor (duh).
3736 2018-06-05 16:25:00 Instead of drilling for oil, and risking another environmental disaster that would cripple tourism; the Sunshine State should harvest the solar power we have in abundance.
3737 2018-06-05 16:24:55 I’ve checked description of most products of it on google and visited their global official website, this one I bought is more like the ‘moisturizing oil’ and not include the function of polish(as well as Chinese edition).It’s kind of you to tell me the potential results,Thanks
3738 2018-06-05 16:24:44 DO NOT WEED WHACK IT!!! You will end up wearing it. Probably forever. And getting the oil all over everything. Also probably forever.

It is an anti black, anti poor and anti women.

3795 2018-06-05 16:19:11 He's right, canola is controversial, and olive oil is better!

Canola is the best of the seed oils, high-oleic canola is even better. 

Not eating it is probably best, but in the #Context of what Virta is doing, it's a reasonable compromise.
3796 2018-06-05 16:18:57 Try Tuesday Morning if you have one in your area. They have inexpensive but high quality olive oil for 1/3 of grocery store prices. They also come in dark, glass bottles.
3797 2018-06-05 16:18:56 This saddens me. It appears the whole racial sensitivity training was about his political aspirations. He is just another snake oil salesman.

3799 2018-06-05 16:18:39 I've made it with avocado oil (gross, but I also hate avo oil in general), and slightly heated bacon fat (good). 
Stick blender method every time. All you need is a liquid fat source (even if it's melted) to add to a normal recipe.

3805 2018-06-05 16:18:02 In fact, much of Mexico's high-tech imports come from the Scandinavia. MX imports billions of euros (€) of chips a year, more than oil. Most of them come from Scandinavian companies, such as Volvo.

3808 2018-06-05 16:17:33 I’m also surprised #Crude #Oil $CL_F is not higher... it’s at least green, but should actually be moving up— still early.
3809 2018-06-05 16:17:26 Good luck!! You may experience hair growth.. brows, lashes and peach fuzz. I’ve only noticed a really small increase in peach fuzz but it’s very blonde and the no wrinkles are worth it! It has castor oil in it.

3811 2018-06-05 16:17:14 Maybe the use of truffle oil tells you that a chef doesn’t watch #Chopped? Or, to be fair, that they haven’t watched (and remembered) every episode? There have been a few...

3813 2018-06-05 16:17:09 Retweeted The Senate President (@SPNigeria):

3814 2018-06-05 16:17:07 What if democrats oppose oil production just to help our enemies?
3815 2018-06-05 16:16:51 It’s the summer heat, happens every year. Demand for electricity rises significantly in this heat. Also as oil prices rise in the global markets that will also impact energy production negatively.

3821 2018-06-05 16:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and powerful politicians.
3822 2018-06-05 16:16:02 I once suggested a friend who was going bald to mix elfy in Olive oil and apply it to his hair.

3826 2018-06-05 16:15:42 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
3827 2018-06-05 16:15:34 It's the person that has not been to the farm of another person's father that would confidently say there is no farm bigger than his father's. These figures are staggering! If Nigeria had this much access we'd by now be a nation gone mad with oil!

3836 2018-06-05 16:14:50 Question for my artist friends:
If I draw something on regular hotpress watercolor, and then do a coating of acrylic medium on top, should it be good to go for painting with oil on top? How many coats would make it ok, if yes?
3837 2018-06-05 16:14:47 Can you actually make mayo without seed oils or no?  The baconaise recipes I find have oil in it still and I don't wanna potentially waste a bunch of eggs to try it  aaaaah .. I love mayo

3863 2018-06-05 16:12:11 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
3864 2018-06-05 16:12:08 Nice but then why are we still paying $2+ a gallon when oil is only at $50 or so a barrel????? I remember when it was $120 a barrel and paying then what we are paying now
3865 2018-06-05 16:12:07 It's like the kiss of death; it never ends well lol

I'm curious if anyone who has used truffle oil has ever won #Chopped?

3872 2018-06-05 16:11:21 Just put my car in the shop to have several things done. When I get it back I’ll probably have a new battery, two new tires, a new muffler, an oil change, ... and a much smaller bank account. LOL!  But it’s worth it!  :)

3881 2018-06-05 16:10:35 It's absolutely mind blowing, isn't it? I'm stuck with two @GOP Senators who haven't worked for the people that elected them and have no intention of doing so. They're owned by big oil money and have been complicit in this treason and destruction of our democracy.

The dollar is trading at R12,82, the euro at R14,94 and the British pound at R17,09. Gold is selling at $1293,51 a fine ounce and Brent crude oil is quoted at $74,09 a barrel.

3936 2018-06-05 16:05:04 They moved to CA to ranch, and discovered the oil while wandering around the area. Large citrus ranching operations here. They came up with a market for the oil by inventing the *smudge pot*, a portable oil fired crop heater to protect against winter freezes
3937 2018-06-05 16:05:01 Fingers crossed for you.. 
The scam is when I had mine removed and I had insurance on it they would not remove it unless I had a new one installed to continue with oil. A leaky oil tank and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars
3938 2018-06-05 16:04:58 How? Car still use them, and Trump is aiding oil enterprises everywhere.
3939 2018-06-05 16:04:57 Big Oil Loves Ethanol , Its a cheap way to raise Octane rating , Trump Created this DC Swamp Gas problem , He Traded Ethanol for IOWA Corn votes , IOWA GOV Terry Branstad got Ambassador to China Job , America gets to pay for this Agricultural Welfare , Buy a Electric car
3940 2018-06-05 16:04:54 I don't agree here. The approaches are opposed to each other. It also dismisses the idea of consensus breaking for expediency as an attack vector.

Similar to disagreeing over water/oil as engine lubricant. 
"Compromising" water+oil = bricked engine as if we just used water.
3941 2018-06-05 16:04:52 I ditched all my skin care products and switched to cleaning my face only with water tea tree oil. Shits a gamechanger
3942 2018-06-05 16:04:37 Oil energy losing popularity. This is what we want to start adding back in soon.
3943 2018-06-05 16:04:29 After part of the air filter apparatus was left loose after my oil change, a rep from @Valvoline drove to my house within minutes of my call to fix it. High five, guys!
3944 2018-06-05 16:04:16 This is atrocious! Please remove the lid fully. Come the apocalypse, you can't afford to get a nasty cut from the sharp edges. Infections can kill and there won't be antibiotics. Also, the ones in olive oil are objectively better.

Otherwise, solid lunch, carry on.
3945 2018-06-05 16:04:11 Imagine the economic potential of a free Iran. Iran, unlike Saudi Arabia, is a mixed economy not fully dependent on oil. An Iran with open markets won't be nearly as effected by oil price fluctuation like it is now.
3946 2018-06-05 16:04:02 I guess her oil change and battery recharge is done
3947 2018-06-05 16:03:59 you are fraudulent snake oil salesman.  not just a joke.  a dangerous joke.  a risk to human health joke
3948 2018-06-05 16:03:45 nothing special tbh condition every day, shampoo every other day, and caster oil
3949 2018-06-05 16:03:43 Dear Dhermandra ji as we know every day petrol price going down but in our ruler area in my place called siwan petrol price remains same 84.56 pissa.that petrol belong to Indian oil
3950 2018-06-05 16:03:29 Well I have used certain products before but after try everything I am stuck only one simple coconut oil for smoothness and the growth is the natural

3961 2018-06-05 16:02:52 You’re a plum. She closed less pots than Wilson FACT ? It was cheaper to import than to mine. And mark my words. Oil is going the same way. Cheaper to import than drill. You socialist have no idea how to run a country.
3962 2018-06-05 16:02:42 I saw the initial tweet about what you used and how much, but I was curious about any other methods, how you applied it, where you might have gotten what you used. And I totally missed the next tweet about the clay mask and oil. But I’m cool off it now.
3963 2018-06-05 16:02:38 Getting an oil tank removed. Please pray it was emptied “correctly.” This entire thing is an absolute SCAM these tanks were decommissioned. Now they have to be “extracted” or no one from Brooklyn will bid on your house. Absolute scam.

3977 2018-06-05 16:01:12 I'm no economist or lawyer, but wouldn't reducing supply by disbanding a few oil companies be a stabilizing influence on the economy?
3978 2018-06-05 16:01:10 Big Oil Loves Cheap Ethanol , Its a cheap way to raise Octane ratings .

3983 2018-06-05 16:00:33 Perhaps the biggest obstacle is the concern about cleaning up a large oil spill plus the "eyesore" of all those ugly ships in Canada's most beautiful location. Its not just a pipeline.

3991 2018-06-05 15:59:46 I keep putting on coconut oil without letting it soak in my skin and i walk outside and it’s like melting on my body and everyone thinks I’m sweating :((((
3992 2018-06-05 15:59:44 Aah me too, I vary with almond milk. Never tried it with coconut oil.
3993 2018-06-05 15:59:41 crossed another thing to do off my list (oil change for my car). Finally received both my unemployment money and loan from 401k too, so now I don't have financial worries

3999 2018-06-05 15:59:04 Or maybe they mean the colour of olive oil?

4010 2018-06-05 15:58:05 The moment you can talk to random oil change guy about what's going on in your engine, and actually understand it.

4015 2018-06-05 15:57:25 Same to you, nice being able to talk without name calling and screaming lol 

I'll look into that coal website you sent me. The new solar panel companies here should lessen that too hopefully.

I am not a fan of big oil either, so I understand, especially since that BP spill.

4020 2018-06-05 15:57:19 There is one creek near me. Because it flows through an area where oil seeps out of the ground naturally, it's not very clean. As kids, we called the mud on its bottom *grease mud*. FYI, the natural seep attracted the attention of some settlers from Pennsylvania

4027 2018-06-05 15:56:53 Thanks for the reply Ted :)

But what I don't get is why so many chefs use truffle oil on #Chopped. Surely they've watched previous episodes and seen that using truffle oil is something the judges always frown upon and that it never adds to the dish.
4028 2018-06-05 15:56:46 Went to the dealership where I bought my car to get an oil change, and that was fine, but now they’re are insisting I leave an “excellent” survey response or call them if I want to leave less than 100%. The service was fine but this seems less than genuine.

4054 2018-06-05 15:53:30 Syria’s insignificant oil is of no concern. The US interest in Syria is purely related to security and expanding Iranian influence. And in ‘53 the US had no oil interests in Iran. The intervention was done for fear that a BP collapse would lead to a communist takeover of the UK.
4055 2018-06-05 15:53:21 Oil is a curse  every country with this natural resource has had to shed a lot of blood .
4056 2018-06-05 15:53:19 You keep believing that.

ROFLMAO!

We supply a good chunk of your oil (at bargain basement prices), most of your steel and aluminium, and one day, likely, your fresh water.

You'd be fucked without us... and probably already invaded by the Russians over your Northern border.
4057 2018-06-05 15:53:15 I remember when I first went natural I bought about a CVS worth of products only to realize years later the best stuff for my hair is water, coconut oil/grape seed oil, and shea butter lol.

And I'm not saying that inspections/inspectors are perfect because they are not but there is a concerted effort from Ofsted

4084 2018-06-05 15:50:59 @Surfrider Hello. This morning in HB, I can see that a boom is being placed around one of the offshore oil platforms closest to Goldenwest. Several boats are assisting in positioning it. Have y’all heard anything?
4085 2018-06-05 15:50:56 Took my car to get an oil change and guess what y’all. They found something wrong 
4086 2018-06-05 15:50:55 "talk" is not usually what Oil Barrons do...
4087 2018-06-05 15:50:49 By the Eric, AutoZone is having a sale on oil. May want to pick up a few cases for you and Donnie Jrs hair.
4088 2018-06-05 15:50:40 #BrentCrude is expected to average more than $70/bbl this year and #WTI should average nearly $66/bbl, according to a #WSJ poll of 12 #investmentbanks, with both estimates ~$6 higher than the forecast from April’s survey. $XLE $XOP $USO $AMLP $AMZA $UWTI $VDE $OIL $OSX
4089 2018-06-05 15:50:30 Guess not many know Carolina Herrera and the real TV series as well as oil and natural gas production before it all became state owned.   Think too many don't understand communism, socialism vs capitalism, nationalism or even free enterprise.
4090 2018-06-05 15:50:29 your lenses seen almost too good to be true, but it seems you have no rush for sell it... , the years of patent are also running out and you are not making any money only spent it , sounds like oil companies buying solar tech to prevent development...
4091 2018-06-05 15:50:22 休日は休める日って書くんですよね……？
4092 2018-06-05 15:50:20 And I don't want to hear about "Subsidies". When was the last time small businesses got a Govt. Handout. Oil, Coal, Farming etc. All gets massive subsidies from the Govt.
4093 2018-06-05 15:50:15 I dont wanna go get an oil change alone, they take too fuckin long
4094 2018-06-05 15:50:11 looking for a reversal in crude oil Long  /CL. Will have to wait to see if this is more than just a dead cat bounce
4095 2018-06-05 15:50:08 With Oil prices rising, enthusiasm for independence rising, and May trashing democracy to get her way on Brexit - I think we may have a perfect storm brewing.
4096 2018-06-05 15:50:04 takes about 8 months for oil output to increase, so it won't make a lick of difference this summer anyway...
4097 2018-06-05 15:49:58 Glad I’m not alone. Imagine being the only republican millennial in a group of liberals that constantly whine about feminism and make fun of Trump, in Alabama of all places.
4098 2018-06-05 15:49:57 Lol! Why blame the president for the pricing of oil in international market? Lol go live and ask american people and ask the price of all the oil products as of today and see what you're talkig about

4100 2018-06-05 15:49:48 I guess we have to hope that the whole world abandons fossil fuels, then Canada will finally give up removing oil from the earth.
4101 2018-06-05 15:49:48 Sorry but I disagree with you, remember the oil spill in 2010 just to name one?
4102 2018-06-05 15:49:46 Why is it OK to artificially increase the price on oil but not OK to do the same for coal fired steel. Help me out here.
4103 2018-06-05 15:49:46 I would add -  make your own salad dressing!  Invest in good oil and balsamic vinegar.  Lemon,  honey,  dijon mustard,  garlic cloves.  Endless possibilities.  It's much cheaper,  healthier.  Easy.  And tastes better.

4151 2018-06-05 15:43:10 Norway used its oil reserves to power itself on renewables and boost its economy. What would the U.K. possibly have in mind of a similar nature?

4212 2018-06-05 15:37:03 And yet we allow over 4 thousand tankers per year  in eastern canada to bring oil since we don't have a pipeline east . And in the West with only the us buying our landlocked oil at a steep discount.  We are a nation financially crippled by protesters who need services ?

4223 2018-06-05 15:36:20 Tea is planted, weeded, sprayed, plucked etc. Therefore for Turkana or Borana to benefit, they shoukd contribute in weeding or buying the herbicides. Who weeds oil in turkana or grazes the zebras in Masai Mara?
4224 2018-06-05 15:36:19 Is Cecil long commodities?! I’m putting it all on metals, natural gas and oil!!!
4225 2018-06-05 15:36:04 There are cures for cancer & chemo is NOT it. People look worse when they do chemo. CBD oil & a plant based diet can help. I bullshit you NOT. Don’t be so quick to do what the Dr says... they get paid whether you’re cured or not...
4226 2018-06-05 15:36:04 The downstream oil and natural gas development in Appalachia panel was great, as was learning what expression TAFT is short for. Excited for India's Energy Economy breakout session starting now. #EIAConf
4227 2018-06-05 15:36:00 2 weeks of oil prices dropping & gasoline is still high. The lying greedy bastards of the oil companies will lie & say summer traveling or a refinery is down or summer formula or some other ridiculous excuse but it is just greed for more money.
4228 2018-06-05 15:35:57 I should not get a damn sinus infection trying to hide in the bathroom stalls. Who the fuck bathed in Muslim oil at work??

4230 2018-06-05 15:35:49 It's pretty rare in Ontario now for Propane or Natural Gas vehicles. Going gas/hydro hybrids and some electric vehicle, not a lot of charging stations. Outside  of cities most people on oil or propane for heat, some solar or geothermal

4240 2018-06-05 15:34:42 Alaskans own 15,893 shares of CABOT OIL & GAS CORP, worth $380,002. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
4241 2018-06-05 15:34:31 Nothing would make big oil and gas happier than to see @elonmusk fail. It's in the world's best interest that he doesn't fail. He's literally pulling us out of the 20th Century by his efforts.

4248 2018-06-05 15:33:46 I see it’s anal season on Twitter again. Heading to Costco now to take advantage of their 5 gallon jug of Coconut Oil that I’m sure they have.
4249 2018-06-05 15:33:31 Getting oil changes stress me out when they start asking you to do your turn signals and stuff like I get legitimate test anxiety.

4267 2018-06-05 15:32:03 Is it correct to blame government regulatory delay for the disparity in investment? Note that KXL is 10 years in regulatory gestation but TMX is only 5 years and both at a similar stage. Isn’t the problem the inherently higher cost of tar sands upgrading versus light oil?
4268 2018-06-05 15:31:58 Fancy olive oil.
4269 2018-06-05 15:31:58 Going to quarter my soap recipe so I get enough for one loaf and try getting the lye right again. I went through 1.5kg of olive oil on the two loaves this weekend

4271 2018-06-05 15:31:52 @Chris_Liss Don't use any oil or eat foods that use them, including olive oil.
4272 2018-06-05 15:31:49 because some years ago the USA persuaded/threatened) the oil rich kingdoms to abandon their Euros for oil policies.... hence we are lagging behind..
4273 2018-06-05 15:31:41 What’s going on today though? Is it down bc price of crude oil has dropped? Is the party over?

4306 2018-06-05 15:28:36 you can build hydrogen economy on renewable energy. and nat gas with CCS, and biogas reformation. hydrogen will be exported also from MENA to the whole world, just like oil today, just like australia will export to Japan in 2020.

4311 2018-06-05 15:28:00 I heard on the radio that he’s in Sherwood Park today at Kinder Morgan. I don’t know what the he is doing there. Maybe handing out rainbow flags and showing the oil workers how to cry! Lol idiot
4312 2018-06-05 15:27:49 I will be singing throughout the night while burning the electricity cost (instead of midnight oil) coz i love my own frogy voice
4313 2018-06-05 15:27:45 This trend BS must stop. Obama fudged numbers by reducing the participation rate. It is now stabilized & moving up and the numbers are good. Also wages are increasing, GDP growth is stronger, we're now exporting oil and we're getting EU to foot more of the NATO bill.

4317 2018-06-05 15:27:31 @COVERGIRL your commercial makes it out to be that women who don't wear make up, don't care about themselves. What a disgusting thing to do. Maybe we actually care more and would rather not clog our pores with trash and oil..
4318 2018-06-05 15:27:26 She was never against legalization and recently moved to full support for it.  If she lost, it's because corporate ag, tobacco, mining, coal, and oil interests worked together to deceive supporters about her while she didn't go negative on the other candidates.

4321 2018-06-05 15:27:23 Hydrogen may be interesting today in clusters where you already have supply. But that is not enough for a mass market. Tell me, why must we always put fossil free alternatives against each other instead of substitute as much oil as possible?

4341 2018-06-05 15:25:09 It's the idea that it's a danger that they cannot see. They can see oil and trash and other waste so it can be mentally processed. They cannot see gamma rays and neutrons and beta particles etc. Fear of the unknown. It's human nature.
4342 2018-06-05 15:24:55 How many years of oil reserves is left in the World and the US? We are opening our only strategic reserves ANWR. We must remember the last country with fighter jets flying will win...Russia has larger reserves than the US....hmmmm
4343 2018-06-05 15:24:37 Why are we still importing oil if we can produce it?
4344 2018-06-05 15:24:25 Oilsand leave earth cleaner as oil is extracted. It used to leak into Athabaska River well before commercial ops started. Alberta would be as rich as Norway if it has the same immigration ( ie almost nil) and no payments to Ottawa via GST, CPP, EI, fed & prov income taxes.

4427 2018-06-05 15:16:15 10 years of brutal punishment is leniency to you. First work in a old fashioned oil grinding mill without access to any basic necessities. It's a hell.  First read the conditions in Adman jail and then compare that with political prisoners with all the privileges.
4428 2018-06-05 15:16:10 Misleading.  We’re talking about expanding a pipeline to Vancouver.  Expanding it because more oil will be needed in the area over the next ~30 years.

4448 2018-06-05 15:14:40 And on the other hand, of those really were oil pipelines would one more added on top of all of those be the one that caused catastrophic earth ending climate change? So in other words, by chance they stopped building them at the exact right number.

4492 2018-06-05 15:10:00 @DemiDonnellyx the reason your fake tan went funny will be because of the oily sun cream you are using!! Any oil takes off tan x
4493 2018-06-05 15:09:55 Andrew.. please speak to Canada’s largest  held oil stock.. Suncor.  It’s getting hammered today. Meanwhile the much much smaller ones are not.  There’s news of some kind on Suncor.  Pls try to cover at 1120 today in your segment. . Either that on your phone in segment at noon

4502 2018-06-05 15:09:21 You both are the definition of limited hangouts. The wars in Syria and Iraq were not for oil or big business but for Zionist interests.
4503 2018-06-05 15:09:14 Why export the oil. Keep it here and lower the prices.
4504 2018-06-05 15:09:14 My skin has FINALLY turned to a light golden'ish `light-freckled' tan - hehe!!

4514 2018-06-05 15:08:31 The Trump admin’s dangerous offshore drilling plans put virtually coastlines at risk of devastating oil spills and extreme weather disasters. @EPAScottPruitt' dirty energy policies sell out our beaches and public oceans just to boost oil industry profits. #BootPruitt
4515 2018-06-05 15:08:22 That is surprising as with new technology- fracking the Peak Oil theory lies in tatters.  Now it’s Peak Demand.  Whether we will as a society move past Peak oil demand before all the oil has been sold.  A likely scenario

4522 2018-06-05 15:07:51 Ok I have just read in laymen terms about the heat equation, And from what i can gather it is describing a particle (a versatile one) let me give you an example, if you put chips in oil do the chips become the oil or the does the oil become the chips ? neither one is the answer

4538 2018-06-05 15:05:51 It ebbed and flowed during ML.

Its resolution was cut short by EDSA.

And Cory fortuitously became the beneficiary of the end of the oil crisis in 86.

4554 2018-06-05 15:04:30 2. Even if we hypothetically said the gas prices went down every month Obama was Pres. If that wasn't indicative of approaching oil independence why would the converse be true?
4555 2018-06-05 15:04:28 Have you tried CBD oil or pot? Depending on where you live, I think Dr's can prescribe either one.

4557 2018-06-05 15:04:21 And this comes amid attractive diesel and gasoline cracks. In my view this is the use of synthetic WTI from shale and heavy oil, which reduces utilization rates.

4562 2018-06-05 15:03:56 Who can tell
The oil crisis ended dramatically in March of ‘86

Just a month after EDSA

Fortuitous for Cory?
You betcha

At least 1.5Billion USD per year in forex the PH no longer had to spend

Did it make all commodities cheaper, slash inflation?

Hell yes

4613 2018-06-05 14:59:17 I think @realDonaldTrump should put a variable tariff on foreign oil to put a floor under US domestic oil production. It would make the US oil industry boom and would create an economic boom in the US. It would also stabilize US oil prices to promote long term US oil investments.
4614 2018-06-05 14:59:14 You’re trying to help your donors in the fossil fuel industry instead of doing right for the country. The price of oil was great until the Republicans & Trump started fighting to help Russia, Israel against Iran for oil. The Iran Deal for Republicans - oil

4619 2018-06-05 14:58:38 Oil prices are falling but that’s not ‘sexy’ dialogue so it won’t surface much. The USA is putting pressure on OPEC to pump more oil. Supply will drive price reductions.

4632 2018-06-05 14:57:40 Why do we dislike truffle oil on #Chopped? Most is synthetic & contains no truffle. It’s strong, & tends to overwhelm a dish. It was trendy (a long time ago), & we don’t like trendiness. It feels pretentious, now—a cheap way to try to make a dish seem fancy.
4633 2018-06-05 14:57:40 Price signaling is one of the most powerful tools in Oligopolistic industries. Airlines, oil, ... ARAMCO did that today raising the prices in Europe. Not sure if the funds see it, but Total, Shell, BP, XOM, CVX Statoil.. will NOT miss that signal.
4634 2018-06-05 14:57:32 #Food and #wine update from #Croatia. I have really enjoyed the #Croatian wine. Ice drizzled with olive oil crazy good.
4635 2018-06-05 14:57:30 甘いやつにしますか…しょっぱいものにしますか…(右手にチョコパイ、左手にポテチ)
4636 2018-06-05 14:57:29 Why not use the toxic tarssands #oil #pipelines that destroy our environment as Canadian oil pollutes our air and water before being shipped overseas for Canadian profits? #cleanup #tariffs
4637 2018-06-05 14:57:28 Moisturizing yah man’s dreads and beard w that mango Castro oil >>>>>>>
4638 2018-06-05 14:57:19 Someone come with me to get an oil change and grab lunchhhh
4639 2018-06-05 14:57:18 Still not much above mediocre.

*Biggest News is that USA has asked Opec to pump another One Million Barrels per Day to keep oil prices down.
4640 2018-06-05 14:57:17 @paulkrugman @nytimes hahahaha
4641 2018-06-05 14:57:16 Another day without E15 and another day @EPAScottPruitt  is working for the oil swamp at the same time saying he is clearing the air.. @POTUS support biofuels not @EPAScottPruitt's  oil slick scheme
4642 2018-06-05 14:57:12 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
4643 2018-06-05 14:57:11 Deadass, he freaking left the state back in 2007 when the oil spill happened.
4644 2018-06-05 14:57:04 I wonder if the pioneers of oil painting felt the same. I can imagine they did: thought first that, oh, these paints give me an advantage, until other learned to do the same.
4645 2018-06-05 14:56:59 Why in tf am I still here for a fucking oil change smh
4646 2018-06-05 14:56:54 To set up a chart to follow what you're indicating, what indicators are you using so I can follow better?  I had oil dumping and the RUT gaining as next moves... so I'm looking at this incorrectly...
4647 2018-06-05 14:56:53 I feel youuuu!! I legit used to only use baby Johnson products imagine  I've branched out to Mario badescu and can also use bio oil/sudocrem so Alhamdulillah  but legit so many makeup brands are bad for me, even hair product if it accidentally touches my face smh
4648 2018-06-05 14:56:40 Sure but recent move of oil lower does not have to do with usd but OPEC policy
4649 2018-06-05 14:56:29 Peppermint essential oil!
4650 2018-06-05 14:56:12 Can some clever person explain to me why the price of oil keeps dropping but the price of petrol and diesel keeps going up?
4651 2018-06-05 14:56:10 Et oui, mais non. C’est comme de dire que mon vote ne change rien. Pourtant le résultat est bien l’ensemble des votes... qui ne changent rien.
4652 2018-06-05 14:56:10 うれしみ(*´﹃｀*)
4653 2018-06-05 14:56:09 You should join them in mourning, bam. Maybe the oil prices will decline after.

4655 2018-06-05 14:55:49 What are your views on Olive oil? I'm Italian trained, and use Olive oil for most meals.
4656 2018-06-05 14:55:47 Trump - "The poor oil - Opp's Children."  I meant to say the poor Children.
4657 2018-06-05 14:55:42 Westie the type of guy to chug a full bottle of olive oil in the corner at E3

4660 2018-06-05 14:55:27 I'd feel nothing. I'll give him oil and brush to treat the hair for the next day
4661 2018-06-05 14:55:12 From januar 2007-june 2008 crude oil went from $72-$160 an increase of 122%. From Januar 2016-june 2018 crude oil has gone from $30.12-$68.57 an increase of 127%. Oil tends to rise sharply before recessions.

4665 2018-06-05 14:55:01 Nuclear, oil, automotive, commercial marine, transport, pretty much ANY industry in the UK that needs engineers!
4666 2018-06-05 14:55:00 US Crude Oil Production not exports. It's a great number and will continue to climb. Exports are up as well.
4667 2018-06-05 14:54:54 I just got an oil change like three weeks ago. My friends boyfriend who’s a mechanic said it’s a broken thermostat. Meh
4668 2018-06-05 14:54:54 One day long time ago, before 'June 16', Some people put sanctions on Apartheid to purchase cried oil. SASOL was born. What happened to this child, it has lost focus. Fuel from coal, fuel from sugar. I wonder what's happening in offshore rigg in Moselbay.
4669 2018-06-05 14:54:40 BMW- you need everything fixed on your car

4671 2018-06-05 14:54:20 If IRI under-40 demographic took power tomorrow and transformed IRI into a secular republic oil majors would be working Iranian oil fields within a couple of years and IRI would be wealthy in a decade...

4673 2018-06-05 14:53:42 My latest “game” is see how long it takes a sales drone to mention “blockchain” as the snake oil to cure all ills...

4678 2018-06-05 14:53:16 I would say Mulally managed Ford very much for the short term- his collection of Euro imported compact vehicles was ill suited to the US market when the oil price started to halve pretty much the day he left Ford. To some extent gave GM and FCAU an open goal + the high cost base
4679 2018-06-05 14:53:15 Hi there Peter hope you're well? I wonder what R ur thoughts on Lyposomal Vitamin C highdosage E.g. 1k mg for treating or aiding recovery 4 such things as cancer,ME, Chronic Fatigue,Lymes & what ur findings (if any) R on this supplement. Also CBD oil 4 treating Cancers 2? Cheers

4682 2018-06-05 14:53:04 Hahaha. 
In the Maritimes they don't even have auto propane or natural gas vehicles or fill up station's, %50 of nova Scotia still uses oil for heat...

4686 2018-06-05 14:52:19 Pro tip: before an important teleconference, buy a bunch of cats and spread tuna oil on your webcam.
4687 2018-06-05 14:52:13 That oil had me in their Saturday. !
4688 2018-06-05 14:52:03 What was the price of oil then?If they  created a Sovereign Wealth Fund to save for the downturn in oil price ...
4689 2018-06-05 14:52:02 i just changed my bedsheet less than an hour ago and i was eating on my bed and i actually left an oil stain on the new bedsheet. thankfully the design is a lil bit crowded i hope my mom wont see it 
4690 2018-06-05 14:52:02 They are not popular, Josh, they are feared. ISIS came with 4WD vehicles, sneaked & robbed & killed rebels. They always had safe passage through regime's lines & they guaranteed Assad's supply of oil. They virtually eradicated moderate rebels in north east. 1/2

4692 2018-06-05 14:51:45 Can’t right now, I’m applying oil on my beard
4693 2018-06-05 14:51:45 If the manufacturers of the essential oil could be tracked down and discovered to have made illegal medical claims which lead to this, they could be liable. Report this to FDA.
4694 2018-06-05 14:51:42 Good dieting advice. More useful concepts to add/try: 

*Hydration (100oz+ daily) 
*Minimal diuretics (eg, caffeine) 
*D3 & Fish Oil supplementation 
*Sleep (8hr+ daily)
4695 2018-06-05 14:51:41 I use a combination of oil based and powder makeup for cosplay purposes. My skin works well with that.
4696 2018-06-05 14:51:40 He’s a snake oil salesman
4697 2018-06-05 14:51:36 i think crude oil is so made in deep ground.
4698 2018-06-05 14:51:36 Must order me some Oil . That’s a must
4699 2018-06-05 14:51:32 ทำไมร้ายอ่ะ
4700 2018-06-05 14:51:28 Granted it is the smallest of tiny rashes. Pretty sure it's not a bug bite. I had even washed with technu, so I'm wondering if I had a little scratch there and then the oil was able to get in.
4701 2018-06-05 14:51:24 そこまで言われると照れるのですが、、(？)

4702 2018-06-05 14:51:19 I swear coconut everything is trash. My hair hates coconut oil. Almond Joy/Mounds is trash. Coconut cake is trash. Coconut milk/water = TRASH.
4703 2018-06-05 14:51:15 Maybe coconut oil? It is a weird texture idk if that would be better or worse for you but maybe worth a try
4704 2018-06-05 14:51:13 If you were honest and just saying, I don’t care, our oil patch employees a lot, it’s our main source of revenue, without it we’d just be a wet pit stain between Vancouver and Toronto, I could respect that when people said it.  Instead you get the disingenuous trot that you spout
4705 2018-06-05 14:51:08 Oil change ?
4706 2018-06-05 14:51:06 “Ms.Montez you know you’re 3,000 miles over due on your oil change ?”
Yeah about that, so sorry lol 
“I’ll just check everything for you, go get your coffee” 
4707 2018-06-05 14:51:05 How much y'all usually pay for an oil change?..

4711 2018-06-05 14:50:49 Thing is, Cadet Bone Suprs has always wanted to be an @NFL owner, but the #NFL knew #Trump was a sleazy snake oil salesman, and wouldn't let him into their exclusive club...this is now his payback.
4712 2018-06-05 14:50:45 Oil companies always deploy assets to simplest cheapest oil first.  IRI politics always made Iranian oil less simple to extract than other assets in region.
4713 2018-06-05 14:50:32 I just put on my boots and get back to work; Covered in oil, blood, sweat and dirt and I think of them
Untill I'm home again
4714 2018-06-05 14:50:20 Myself yes , I’m trying to establish a natural hair product using a few natural oils and it has been working great on me and a few of my good friends , all I need is money for bottles and a logo cause I have saved up enough to purchase the oils I use to make the hair oil!!!
4715 2018-06-05 14:50:15 Anybody use wild growth oil? I just bought some
4716 2018-06-05 14:50:14 Thirded.  Also good, if you know there's no nut allergy: walnut oil, which is amazing in salad dressings
4717 2018-06-05 14:50:13 I just die laughing at the liberal comments.
If Hilary was elected 10 new islamic terrorist groups would have been created and probably 
Empire state building would have fallen from a crashing plane filled with oil from the east... 
But what do i know. I am probably talking bs
4718 2018-06-05 14:50:11 Coconut oil as your"good fat" in your smoothie... I'm gonna just go get almond butter next time. #notsomuch I'm chugging just to finish my breakfast 
4719 2018-06-05 14:50:06 72 was when the first oil crisis hit.

That lasted a long time and was followed by a second oil crisis.

We didn’t have OFWs or BPOs then, did we?
Where was FOREX supposed to come from?

Who pionerred OFWs ?
Has it not been our salvation?

And BNPP?

4741 2018-06-05 14:47:30 It seemed like the the Canadian dollar was hoping oil would reverse.

But that never happened.

The labor productivity number that came out finally broke the camel's back.   Was a huge miss. Huge. For the dollar not to be affected by that would have been epic.

4746 2018-06-05 14:46:59 Can’t slick a can of oil 
4747 2018-06-05 14:46:53 I think the government should get involved when there are externalities involved in a private business or persons actions. Companies shouldn’t be dumping oil in the lake, but lots of regulations on environment are stupid. Tesla has done more for the the environment than the govt.
4748 2018-06-05 14:46:50 Putin helps US  in booming economy, and produce more oil so that Russia can sell less of their oil.

4771 2018-06-05 14:43:34 then move to Alabama... where backwards hillbillies thrive and people are gullible enough to believe anything a snake oil salesmen pitches.
4772 2018-06-05 14:43:32 A few years ago we made a billet oil pan for our 2 rotor RX8 that would store 6.5 quarts of oil.

4776 2018-06-05 14:43:10 What about cheap communication which was Rs. 30,000/- for 200 GB in Congress to present 200 GB at Rs. 399/- in BJP rule i.e. cost saving of Rs. 9,850/- month?  BJP does not want people to commute but save on costs to cut oil imports.   #शिवराज_टैक्स_लूट

4791 2018-06-05 14:42:13 I have always used Joico colour therapy shampoo & conditioner, I love it and it keeps my colour. Couldn’t get any so I picked up a L’Oréal Elvive colour protect and it’s been fine with no dramatic loss of colour, albeit I do use an oil on my hair before I dry it.

Makanya kdang membersihkan wajah untuk yang bener2 bersih gak cukup hanya dengan pembersih muka yang berbasis air, karena kotoran yg tidak larut air masih tetap menempel.

4796 2018-06-05 14:41:49 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

4820 2018-06-05 14:39:31 Cotton not that great. But plastic is a byproduct of the oil industry. So think all the externalities not necessarily accounted for. For example are wars taken into consideration (they use up quite a lot of CO2). How much are they subsidised by worst CO2 industry on planet. Etc.

4823 2018-06-05 14:39:13 Yeah, I will get a steroid Rx at work today. Using lavender essential oil, it helps.

4844 2018-06-05 14:36:48 Nah I used coconut oil. Never used sesame seed oil. Had a friend use extra virgin olive oil religiously and she felt that it made her teeth less white instead of more. Makes sense given the color, so I've only used coconut oil.
4845 2018-06-05 14:36:36 Trying out a new essential oil tonight with hopes that the dream this time is about riding on a unicorn with James McAvoy. And then it rains tepung pelita. Yeahh.
4846 2018-06-05 14:36:31 I agree.  But IRI is famous for driving hard bargains which has in part slowed the benefits of JCPOA, IRGC is reluctant to give up its shaded markets which has also contributed, and SL has been slow to diversify economy away from oil, which has been fatal to IRI development...

4849 2018-06-05 14:36:11 Lol and is not bullying! Haitians have been migrating to Venezuela, Chile and Dominican Republic. Why? For the same reason, economic crisis. Venezuela is not producing more oil, so its only hope is a debt condonation. Liberty for oil

4874 2018-06-05 14:33:36 1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp castor oil
2 tsp honey

You can also do coconut oil instead if you dont have any of those 2. Then leave it on for 30 mins - 1 hr or even longer. When in the shower, shampoo first before wetting your hair! Or else it'll be harder to get the oil out. 
4875 2018-06-05 14:33:34 The best discovery in my skincare routine: Micellar water.. I never thought I need it since I don’t wear makeup but when I start adopting it into my routine, I realise my skin is easier to handle and less breakout.. and it’s way cheaper than oil cleanser..

4879 2018-06-05 14:33:09 But the taxes were already ridiculously high in 2011.

Not really - the oil prices haven't been affected much by that.

Tea tree oil can be used around the house as disinfectant. So can bleach. I’ll stand by my assertion that these oils aren’t medicinal. If they’re proven to be in blind studies w/human subjects in journals, Pls let me know.

4915 2018-06-05 14:28:55 loved the way the oil sperated from the soup when stirred in. Wild Garlic rocks, love going picking it too, means a wander through some old woods and a pint at a country pub, its what  makes life GOOD

4918 2018-06-05 14:28:32 Because the US also had oil? Also, I believe, many UK mining communities had (at least initially) to attract labour from elsewhere, so perhaps that established some sort of level.

4938 2018-06-05 14:26:33 If California splits off from the Union, you guys will likely have bad trade relations with every US ally and enemy, as to not piss off the US, and you guys would likely collapse from lack of oil, coal, rubber, tin, etc. Also, if you leave the U.S. will become overwhelmingly red!

4951 2018-06-05 14:24:30 Mueller’s actions have EVERYTHING to do with conspiring with a foreign power to affect US election. You seem to forget how he has handled mobsters. Works his way up. Even drinking the Kool-Aid one has to view snake oil salesman Trump as a Russia boob and self-enriching scoundrel
4952 2018-06-05 14:24:23 The Bombay Mango Bar, but we’d also recommend you use a powder or organic cornstarch when you know you may get friction, it is most likely due to irritation not oil build up which is most acnes basis.
4953 2018-06-05 14:24:10 I agree in premise with MMT but I think military spending and domestic spending are qualitatively different.  Military spending and use of military force props up the US dollar as a reserve currency and oil denominator for foreign trade.

4960 2018-06-05 14:23:05 The #TMX will have no impact on that whatsoever. Whatever you think is wrong with the NDP won’t be fixed by shipping oil to Asia. I didn’t vote for them, but I like what they are doing on a lot of fronts with issues that were ignored by the last gov’t for many years.
4961 2018-06-05 14:23:03 That looks like an oil painting

4969 2018-06-05 14:22:37 Actually that’s nonsense. It’s because of Trumps Policy with Iran and Venezuela’s garbage economy. They’re the two largest oil producers in the world.

4977 2018-06-05 14:21:29 While investor gossip was about financial-system worries, central bankers were worrying about the weak dollar and soaring oil price.

5003 2018-06-05 14:18:45 Some kind of local treat, like a jar of premium honey. I agree with those who have said olive oil (I like the gourmet ones grown in California). Depending on price point and how big the thank-you is, a gift certificate to a fancy bakery or a local restaurant can be really nice.

5060 2018-06-05 14:12:30 Which ‘international court’ ruled on this? Are you referring to the arbitration tribunal of UNCLOS? “Beijing has pushed for joint oil and gas development in an area of the sea bed that an international court ruled belongs exclusively to Manila.”
5061 2018-06-05 14:12:29 Today a petrol attendant told me I was a pint of oil short after I paid for the fuel. I told him I’d top up next time. He asked why I asked him to check the oil if I wasn’t going to buy any. Then I...

5063 2018-06-05 14:12:23 If you're familiar with how the trading of coconut oil and other by-products work you would appreciate what former Amb ECJ did for the industry when the Philippines was still the biggest producer of the same.

5065 2018-06-05 14:12:07 Yes, I look on labels to see where the item is from. Except for my phone, I boycott items that are connected with cruelty- from clothing,  cosmetics, food, cleaning supplies, etc. Animal tested products or palm oil is devastating to the beings affected.
5066 2018-06-05 14:12:04 I’m boldly saying that  we are best known as coconut oil eating, curly haired, highly-educated Marxists who adore fish as much as our toddy. Nothing less, I tell ya. And frankly, why are we limiting our wedding saree to white with gold borders? #beingmallu
5067 2018-06-05 14:12:00 So.... garbage in our lakes and stream = bad.

5088 2018-06-05 14:09:47 US often calls on allies inside OPEC to increase oil production, this is not an unusual policy. One time Bill Richardson (Energy Sec) called GCC allies during actual OPEC meeting. Google it as it made a media splash.
5089 2018-06-05 14:09:44 Is it only Nigeria that suffered from reduction of oil prices?
You claim "reduction of oil prices and naira lost value" are behind failure of his campaign promises but yet there's money to foot his medical bills and that of his son

5093 2018-06-05 14:09:39 Canada is forced to import foreign oil due to traitorous government and foreign funded activists blocking pipeline and access to world markets. As a consequence we are subject to the price dictates of the Saudi/US regimes. Disgusting.

5118 2018-06-05 14:06:38 This is the real reason why #Trump pulled out of the #IranNuclearAgreement - to drive the price of oil up.

5182 2018-06-05 14:00:15 Then why is Trump creating a tweet storm if this isn't an issue? Seems odd that the president is having a hissy fit and triggered over oil & gas prices if what you are saying is true. Sorry, but I don't buy your synopsis.

5198 2018-06-05 13:57:51 for veggie i'd say just do olive oil instead of the bacon, and then toss with.... i feel like za'atar or baharat-toasted walnuts, crumbled feta (or a creamy goat which would get kind of sauce-y), maybe some pomegranate would be delicious
5199 2018-06-05 13:57:50 Oooo, like you care about people voting. Hey, there are concentration camps in the US. There are children being kept in cages. Do ya think you could take a moment away from sucking up to the oil/gas barons and ranchers and do something about that?

When #US #Oil was running up vigorously, pundits were hyping $100 a barrel oil for weeks without any #WTI charts. Now that it appears to be in free fall, bearish predictions of low or sub $60 are made by many without charts as well to substantiate what they have claimed.

5380 2018-06-05 13:41:11 Yes the 2 year counter-trend oil rally from $26 is likely over. Oil will see new lows in the next year as a global bust hits demand hard. I think WTI can fall to $10. All those betting on higher oil prices may want to rethink that.

5420 2018-06-05 13:37:38 They won’t come down. Crude oil and products are a global commodity, meaning they get delivered to the highest potential payer.  Gasoline/Diesel/Kero are much higher $$ around the world. That’s where it goes, not to low prices USA.

5442 2018-06-05 13:36:05 That does not matter. When oil from Syria was finding its way into the main markets it was moving prices. Traders always have information especially when Zimbabweans were eager to give it out. But the markets didn't move.

5447 2018-06-05 13:35:37 Careful Charlie — average daily US oil production is 20M barrel & we consume 30M barrel. Exporting 10M barrel daily is great but we’re nowhere near energy independent for any sustained period.

5593 2018-06-05 13:19:49 As an fyi, Iran produced 3,8 barrels of oil a day as of May 2018 approximately 1% of global output. Globally, there has been a deficit of 700 000 barrel per day. Therefore, sanctions on them has had an impact on global prices.

5595 2018-06-05 13:19:32 To paraphrase James Clapper, @realDonaldTrump has thrown @PaulManafort so far under the bus that Manafort might as well change the oil while he's down there.

Pardons are for criminals.

5614 2018-06-05 13:18:16 People do seem to underestimate how long it takes to an oil and gas major capital project from discovery to FID to first production. Even in the case of US LNG with exisitng resources, the regulatory and construction processes are often measured in years, not months.

5624 2018-06-05 13:17:19 We don't get our oil from Iran. We are producing more than ever, but it's sold on the world market. Blame the Saudis and OPEC for the last spike in prices. OPEC sets oil prices for the World.
5625 2018-06-05 13:17:16 About the Crude Oil production hike...
Had I dreamed it or this rumor already circulated some days ago?

5632 2018-06-05 13:16:30 Whatsoever we want as believers more than knowing Christ and not in knowing Christ burns on our oil and not the Holy Spirit's oil. Such desire hinders our mortal body from being quickened by the Holy Ghost.

5635 2018-06-05 13:16:22 @realDonaldTrump We are exporting more oil than ever, so why are our gas prices so high?
5636 2018-06-05 13:16:18 What is that mean for real? Still going to IPO ? With lower oil price?
5637 2018-06-05 13:16:12 You can bloom the saffron gently in oil, which can make a little bit of saffron go a very long way. 

Just heat it slowly when oil gets hot take off the heat
5638 2018-06-05 13:16:11 Donald Trump went in and took out the backbone of the Affordable Care Act so his fault.

Oil prices are high because we just had to mess around in the iran nuclear deal. So until us production ramps up prices will continue to rise

5641 2018-06-05 13:15:46 So you think that laws are deciding according to who is stronger, rather than who is correct?

5650 2018-06-05 13:14:43 Must everything be so confrontational? Iran is SA’s 4th largest supplier and in any case they are huge player in the global market with an ability to influence global prices of oil.

Not to mention that they still continue to sell oil and wheat to jihadists and turkey in ES area. They had options, threaten to give Manbij to Assad.

5761 2018-06-05 13:04:34 Attempting to control supply of oil and gas is of little help due to large untapped reservers like China and Russia. Instead of pushing to stop pipelines, why not put that effort into convincing people to curb demand? Top 3 vehicle sales are TRUCKS !!  #actonclimate

5770 2018-06-05 13:03:49 Looking at traditional techniques, most common method is to place carcass in a pit of hot coals/rocks & cover with earth, roast/grill over coals or open fire, or boil inside skin. Mongolians placed hot rocks inside body cavity to cook from inside. Not much deep frying in oil!
5771 2018-06-05 13:03:45 Oil change, tire rotation, and then a consultation to put the third kiddo in braces. 2018 is officially the summer of braces.  Way too much adulting for a summer day.

5787 2018-06-05 13:01:11 Maybe instead of importing oil, import refined fuels. That's what we are needing most. Also, fuel "jobbers" move the price up the most.

5842 2018-06-05 12:57:15 How about start by replicating what Trump is doing 1:1 to remain competitive/solvent.  The US with its record oil output will soon be taking lunches from opec and Canada oil sands. This is a multi prong approach which will create sustained growth for yrs to come.
5843 2018-06-05 12:57:12 The problem is, Trump hasn’t actually done anything to help Russia. What he has done is bomb one of their top allies multiple times, send navy ships to their border, arm Ukraine, sanction them (which helped shut down the Exxon oil deal)...

5845 2018-06-05 12:57:06 Oil prices fell on Monday as U.S. production hit a record high and OPEC members considered boosting supply.

The benchmark Brent crude oil lost $1.26 a barrel, or 1.6%, to a low of $75.53 before recovering to $75.89, down 90 cents, by 1125 GMT.

5866 2018-06-05 12:54:57 No some imports are off course necessary eg minion good device but if the default position is just to import usually from the usa and eu for biotech products how will Africa ever develop.

5881 2018-06-05 12:53:17 Logic is simple.  It is on Turdeau, and may help Canada to get rid of the idiot Justin. On the other hand, Canada should restart refining its own gas at large, and slow down sending oil to the USA.

5884 2018-06-05 12:53:03 Oil has no future. With new technology and with people knowing it's negative effects on environment, the world is moving from fossil oil. In France and Germany car manufacturers have up to 10 years to do away with petrol and diesel cars. Americans have started using their reserve

5944 2018-06-05 12:47:36 Yes, despite  the tight oil surge. It is quite embarrassing for Mr President to ask OPEC first to cut and then not to cut. The vision was to reach gasoline indepence, yet this became not true.

5953 2018-06-05 12:46:11 We are poor because we are poor; poor in thoughts and strategy. Why export? We can use it locally and reduce our oil imports.
5954 2018-06-05 12:45:58 I thought price fixing was illegal but not it appears in the oil industry where they slow down processing, producing less barrels and forcing the price rise.

5978 2018-06-05 12:44:21 Yea but it wont be crypto.  The dip will be a Newport soaked in oil
5979 2018-06-05 12:43:56 Not building Energy East & importing corrupt foreign oil is wrong. Justin- this is cowardly policy! The Liberals jump to offer steel workers financial help-great help Canadian workers! But our drilling activity is still down, rigs are moving south, job losses & suicides are up!
5980 2018-06-05 12:43:43 10 days!!! Going to do an oil change this morning after work and do a final checklist and repack. It's go time!! #ScrambleNorth
5981 2018-06-05 12:43:10 Nastiness is ok.. we all have baggage. But feminism at least gives tools to reflect on patriarchy, careerism, Territorialism - that taints.
5982 2018-06-05 12:43:03 Government: Considering Raising Import Duties On Sunflower Oil, Soya Bean & Mustard Oil
5983 2018-06-05 12:42:32 Because we rely on a organization in the middle east on determining the price of the barrel of oil. And they are gouging us knowing once the oil from all the new areas Trump has released for drilling hits the market in a year or two.
5984 2018-06-05 12:42:29 All this feminism stuff is really pissing me off now. I bet there  are more men that do a bit of cooking and cleaning than there is women that can change an oil filter on a 1980 2.0ltr ford Capri.
5985 2018-06-05 12:42:05 quand le docteur peut rien le snake oil devien la solution
snake oil comes from the 19th-century American practice of selling cure-all elixirs in traveling medicine shows. Snake oil salesmen would falsely claim that the potions would cure any ailments.  it refers to fake products
5986 2018-06-05 12:41:54 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
5987 2018-06-05 12:41:54 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5988 2018-06-05 12:41:49 44-45% UK trade goes to the foriegn EU zone they say. (I assume that to the the EEA - so stuff going to Norway too). What never is clear is the oil and gas value or intra-UK trade - X made in Scotland going to an English firm then shipped to the EEA.
5989 2018-06-05 12:41:46 The railway systems become a broken mess. To continue laying tarmac & filling such with monstrous HGV's burning oil like there's no tomorrow is no solution.

5991 2018-06-05 12:41:29 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.

5996 2018-06-05 12:40:55 Trump made us oil independent? Lol. What about all the workers, investors and entrepreneurs in the oil and gas industry? Try that.

5999 2018-06-05 12:40:25 You forgot big oil.
6000 2018-06-05 12:40:21 See you had to ask Saudia Arabia to increase oil production to try and bring down soaring gas prices, which along with increases from your tariffs, threaten to eat up your debt funded tax cuts that are small for middle and lower income folks.  Running scared are you?
6001 2018-06-05 12:40:20 friend USE THIS!!!! I've been using this for over a year & holy fuck, YES!!!! I also put coconut oil on my face and leave it over night, then wash with the black soap in the morning...WONDERS AF!!!!!

6012 2018-06-05 12:39:41 Oil mix with some
6013 2018-06-05 12:39:21 How about lower prices then? How about us not still buying foreign oil then?
6014 2018-06-05 12:39:09 More like the type of decisions the oil and gas industry has been making over the last 3-4 years. If you can't cut the investment cost by 50% you don't do it. The McCully Saudi Sheep deal was blatant bribery and corruption.

6025 2018-06-05 12:37:26 There is the possibility of using the "wave" energy of the Earth using a multi-tone crystal. The power of this energy is extreme, and the use of oil and fossil fuels could be avoided. The Earth environment would have been preserved.
6026 2018-06-05 12:37:21 Sadly, I find feminist women are also often not self-aware in terms of their toxic behaviour. This is not true of all feminists or all women. I am just trying to analyse why women can be so nasty to each other.

6031 2018-06-05 12:37:11 The Arabs have been pressuring the oil price trying to knock out the Oil Sands projects which will provide oil reserves estimated for the next couple of hundred years.
They haven’t been successful as yet & hurt only themselves.
Low oil prices are good for the economy.
6032 2018-06-05 12:37:04 @Tesco please ditch palm oil and help save species like the orang-Utan, Sumatran tiger and sun bear. Be an environmental leader like @IcelandFoods
6033 2018-06-05 12:36:51 Iran has oil/solar options for energy generation. It has a pop of 81 million. Why do they need nuclear energy? Of course it's not for electric generation, their end game is a bomb. Iran theocratic leadership & policies are dangerous to the world & harmful to their citizens.
6034 2018-06-05 12:36:43 Once upon a time, the Earth was consumed by a giant named Greed. He sucked out its marrow of crude oil. He spit out the bones of its deforested lands. But when it seemed he would #swallow everything, mankind planted Simplicity and he choked on it. #vss365 #green

6036 2018-06-05 12:36:24 Garlic, almond oil and a dusting of red pepper helped me... 
6037 2018-06-05 12:36:22 Kenya, we are a cursed nation. Why are we exporting crude oil, don't we have engineers from our institutions to manage such a plant? I thought there are graduates of chemical engineering from is it Moi Uni? Why aren't not utilizing our own to create wealth?

6045 2018-06-05 12:35:34 No single day passes without news about arrests of friends, colleagues, their trials, tortures or prison problems. Still trying to stay happy in this country. Oil flows, contracts are signed, European investments to despotic regime secured. SIckening!
6046 2018-06-05 12:35:30 fry them forever in olive oil til richly brown, toss in too much garlic puree, a handful of lemon time, a splash of cream, cook down. Serve on toasted sourdough. You'll never look back.
6047 2018-06-05 12:35:28 A bit like Israel. They want the oil for themselves.
6048 2018-06-05 12:35:26 Well really congress changed laws selling  our oil to other countries before Trump was president.

6064 2018-06-05 12:33:54 Wasn't Jeremy praising Venezuela's socialist 'paradise' during the Chavez years? Quite instructive if England wants to duplicate ways to turn the world's largest oil reserve into a nation of beggars, from the land of beauty queens into prostitutes.

6078 2018-06-05 12:32:34 Love ya Charlie but the US produces about 10 million barrels a day but consumes about 19 million barrels a day.

We are still a net importer of oil (8 - 9 million bbls a day).
6079 2018-06-05 12:32:33 "You will also want to consider replacing the oil filter. This will help the air flow through the engine much better than a clogged filter"

sure you didn't mean oil flow? :P
6080 2018-06-05 12:32:24 Lesson of the day: 500 hour old track drive oil from a CAT 299D2 smells like death and doesn’t wash out of clothes.

6084 2018-06-05 12:31:50 And what did I say accompanying that link?
A offshore gas and oil field development will cost maybe $250 billion plus over 10 or 15 years.
Initial capex is high and reduces over time.
The project returns may be calculated over 50 to 75 years.
More than a “generation”
6085 2018-06-05 12:31:27 Dreadful decision by WM  at the time.     An independent Scotland  like Norway would have done the sensible thing and invested the revenue from oil.

6124 2018-06-05 12:26:32 Speaking of nationalities and so much talk of Ducati preferring an Italian, same would go for HRC backed by Spanish oil giant Repsol who IMO would rather prefer JL over a rookie Italian  Morbidelli or Cal for that matter.

6180 2018-06-05 12:20:18 Upstream emissions I can understand, we control those. But Alberta doesn't control if crude oil is exported to market dominated by ICE vehicles (15-20% efficiency) or new Mazda SkyactivX compression ignition (45%) efficiency engines. Big difference in emissions between those 2.

This is very misleading and disappointing. Found this information out today makes no Sense in my opinion.

6251 2018-06-05 12:11:58 When you go to get an oil change and they “recommend” $200 worth of additional services. Not today, Satan.
6252 2018-06-05 12:11:39 What's your take on Kenya's recently launched Early Oil Pilot Scheme? @FoLTurkana @katibainstitute @EconewsAfrica @KLandalliance
6253 2018-06-05 12:11:35 Just came for a oil change and they always want to sell you something else. Smh I guess everyone has to hustle you something lol
6254 2018-06-05 12:11:13 Ok so CO was a Lib? Couldn’t get funding on a “project” and become a CON overnight? Makes sense...and just says a bunch of sh!t words like SLAVE, FREEDOM, MAGA and these people buy the snake oil. #Opportunist #Fraud #Sad #Magag 
6255 2018-06-05 12:11:10 Bbbbbbot... Tsk tsk, Tony.

6258 2018-06-05 12:10:56 Benton essence --> Kleveru --> NatRep

NatRepnya emang dijadiin sleeping mask/moisturizer. Kleveru itu face oil, dan kalo di 10 steps Korean skincare, face oil itu sehabis serum, serum itu dipake sesudah essence. You're welcome.
6259 2018-06-05 12:10:54 Absolutely horrendous is the way adopted by congress to protest against rising oil prices. Bringing cattle on road wasn’t needed for its workers aren’t causing any less nuisance than cattle, by using motor & oil run vehicles, only contradicting the agenda & causing inconvenience.
6260 2018-06-05 12:10:40 I am very much caring abt my hair

6266 2018-06-05 12:10:06 #Oil majors plug into #electric #vehicle #technology | @FThttp://ow.ly/McBo30kgJFT
6267 2018-06-05 12:10:03 Exactly. Not one person who has complained is aware that major oil producers (Saudi Arabia, et al.) agreed to cut production to drive up prices.
6268 2018-06-05 12:10:03 Does it have to do with the fact that USA is now self sufficient in fuel. If an oil producing country is starving - either it’s corruption or wrong government policy. Quality of crude is best there.. still!
6269 2018-06-05 12:09:57 The middle east interference is about the devaluation of our fiat currency by countries trying to move away from pricing oil in USD. 

@navyhato "Black Pigeon Speaks" has done some excellent videos on this on YT. Can't recommend enough.

6271 2018-06-05 12:09:42 #Oil prices fell after reports that U.S. asked #OPEC to increase oil supply by 1 million barrels a day.
6272 2018-06-05 12:09:29 いや、たしかBOCってチームとOILみたいなチームが合体してRADってチームになってたのみたことあるから潰れてると思う
6273 2018-06-05 12:09:02 Good for you!! #LewishamEast Do you have policies to address gender inequality in criminal sentencing, child custody, work deaths, suicide, bin collection industry, nursing, university attendance, military conscription, mining, oil rig work, construction, cancer funding etc.?
6274 2018-06-05 12:08:58 Hooray!!! We can get off oil! Yes.
6275 2018-06-05 12:08:54 Some of the churches are neighbors to tarvens and bottle stores. People who are suffering will believe anything in believe. They can eat grass, buy anointed oil.
6276 2018-06-05 12:08:53 That’s very helpful! It appears to be MCT, mainly the varieties derived from palm kernel oil.
6277 2018-06-05 12:08:52 Why did I think I was clever putting carrot oil on burnt to a crisp now well in Rach 
6278 2018-06-05 12:08:43 Why are we still letting the western countries control our oil and other precious commodities?
6279 2018-06-05 12:08:39 I think countries prefer crude to refined oil reason we too"kenya" did .
6280 2018-06-05 12:08:36 And oil money isn’t doing that?
6281 2018-06-05 12:08:32 Damn damn damn damn!!! $646 for a new starter, a new battery, tire rotation, oil change, inspection, and new wipers. No lube?? No kiss?? No cuddling?? Just gonna stick it in huh? I kid. Be gentle. #Corolla #Firestone

6288 2018-06-05 12:07:47 Thanks! I used a simple marinade of olive oil, lemon, salt, and pepper for the salmon and chicken. Olive oil on the fennel, onions, and peppers. Grilled over medium-low direct heat. My friend made the delicious grilled kale salad. Simple, delicious, keto. #haveagoodone
6289 2018-06-05 12:07:30 I got a great idea. Stop exporting oil. Use it here and get the damn gas prices down to where they are affordable.
6290 2018-06-05 12:07:25 Just had the most uncomfortably refreshing back massage. Rubbed with cannabis oil. I feel great
6291 2018-06-05 12:07:16 We export oil while our prices at the pump go up....?

6296 2018-06-05 12:06:31 Price of fuel may even go up. It doesn't mean when you have oil price will automatically go down. In a free market, if the oil will make people have more money through other sectors, they will willingly afford to pay a higher price.
6297 2018-06-05 12:06:24 #Oil VIX $OVX, open-drive buy Monday, closed 12-ticks off high. Russia: Ok with $60. Hedged too early?
6298 2018-06-05 12:06:21 You really gotta stop embarassing yourself with these gloom&doom predictions that never materialize. The only asset out of the ones you're predicting will crash who actually may crash is Crude oil. Equities may decline 15-20% but will never go to 1840 and Gold is headed to 1400.
6299 2018-06-05 12:06:14 Apparently Sara you didn't hear that OPEC cut production because they weren't making enough money, doing so the cost of a barrel of oil goes up
6300 2018-06-05 12:05:58 Now I understand.  Somebody come put the blessed oil on this spider! STAT!
6301 2018-06-05 12:05:42 The colonialists came to Africa. They brought water and tried to mix it with oil. This was over a century ago. And you're here and at this time still experimenting in the hope that there's a nexus between oil and water. They were stupid/greedy 1914, what are we today in 2018
6302 2018-06-05 12:05:40 Oh yeah, burning the midnight oil lol
6303 2018-06-05 12:05:23 just lubed up my dog :D i put olive oil on his tummy. he just kind of laid down under the table to bemoan his fate for a few minutes but now he's back on his window seat. hehe
6304 2018-06-05 12:05:03 Fuel duty is a constant. Just ask the major fuel companies why it takes so long to bring prices down when the price of oil drops.

6367 2018-06-05 11:56:48 I know many talk about US isolationism, but I see it as unilateralism--no withdrawal from the world, but trying to impose its will.  How much reserves a country should have.  How much oil OPEC should produce.  What weapons a country should have.

6374 2018-06-05 11:55:59 The biggest  ripoff is when we buy SASOL petrol  with the same price of other imported  petrol in the name of  government regulation. Why  fuel made by coal governed  by the oil price? Is the  excuse of not keeping  up with demand  if it becames  cheaper  still valid?

6379 2018-06-05 11:54:55 If nothing else, the move away from oil will sever the disproportionate control the middle east has on the world economy. And I've worked in oil and gas for most of my career!

"A cutback in world oil output, engineered by some of the biggest producers (read Saudi Arabia, et al.), has more than doubled prices from their ebb two years ago."

6391 2018-06-05 11:53:02 And at the end of the day, the best case for the US has always been to keep Chinas growth under wraps. Which brings about another question. Why did bush allow them most favored statues at WTO and open Iraqi oil fields to China?  Worst president ever.

6456 2018-06-05 11:43:43 oil price is moving downward in spite of recording 78 dollars per barrel in the last few days but this level is less than the cap of 80 dollars per barrel.  This is the diminishing returns law in economics

6471 2018-06-05 11:41:06 I enjoy how such a limited vocabulary results in ambiguity like this. Big how? You and Kim wrestling naked in a paddling pool filled with baby oil is ostensibly big. A war would probably be seen as big. Did you mean something good? That’s monosyllabic also y’know.

6519 2018-06-05 11:35:54 I have faith in trump and Canada. the trade agreement was not good for Montana. Oil industries also not good. we house all your wheat supplies for the usa. we are confident that our commodities will sell and will bring good prices. mt= wheat,barley,sugar,cows and sheep.
6520 2018-06-05 11:35:33 Oil World pegged Argentina's soybean output at 36.5 m mt ( vs USDA at 39.0 m mt) while other analysts at 34-35 m mt. Trade will be watching USDA’s updated estimate on June crop report.

6521 2018-06-05 11:35:24 If we are energy independent, why are gas prices so high? Are the oil companies just price gouging?
6522 2018-06-05 11:35:19 Cancer rather more associated w obesity. I challenge you to find study linking meat w cancer that doesn’t have confounders eg high carb/sugar, high omega-6, high processed veg oil, high alcohol. Epidemiological studies known to be too biased.

6559 2018-06-05 11:28:43 Please also compare the crude oil prices then and now along with the USD-INR conversion rates at the respective times - rupee has depreciated since then. The current scenario would make more sense now. In Rupee terms there is not much of an advantage.

6650 2018-06-05 11:14:28 Thank you! I find it amazing that as our oil reserves are dwindling and petrol is getting more expensive, instead of opting for electric Smart sized cars,  the fashion in the UK is for Audi Q7/Range Rover or similar tanks. Nothing to do with the planet just wealth displays.

6793 2018-06-05 10:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
6794 2018-06-05 10:49:58 a good example is Al Gore...this man claims to love the environment, and says how bad fossil fuels are, etc...yet sold his company to an oil holder, and travels in his private jet that uses a bunch of fossil fuels 

He and others like him are playing people
6795 2018-06-05 10:49:47 Arguing with you is like arguing with a drunkard when you are somber. Or arguing with a mad man.who drilled the oil,whose money was used.Did govt use tax payers money to plant tea in private farms?
6796 2018-06-05 10:49:39 Nice double talk. But only the oil industry in Alberta gets this double treatment. Not the Ontario auto industry. Not Quebec’s bombardier. Liberals are full of $hit!

6805 2018-06-05 10:48:48 Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta has already been estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that would come out of the ground.
6806 2018-06-05 10:48:41 You need to keep the beard oil for about 2-3 hours in your beard, after that you can wash it off.
6807 2018-06-05 10:48:40 Also used to like those very short tighs we'd wear cause they matched my red Nike spikes. We'd cream our legs with baby oil because well, natural toned legs needed a shine also. Go phapha go reng that time. 
6808 2018-06-05 10:48:33 In the year of 2018 it is common for vile fans to boycott films and harrass creators but if I want to boycott a biscuit brand that uses palm oil because exploiting it is literally destroying hundreds of rainforests then I’m the “weird” one smh #WorldEnvironmentDay
6809 2018-06-05 10:48:06 Trump to Saudis (MBS): we will take care of Iran, you keep oil prices from going parabolic -> “US said to have asked OPEC for 1m b/d output hike” (recall Apt 20: Trump says OPEC keeping prices artificially high) @ErikSTownsend @LukeGromen #oil #macro

6815 2018-06-05 10:47:07 Nigeria's strategic importance has diminished tremendously as much as we like to lie to ourselves about our global importance. My friend The U.S. buys minimal amounts of oil from us infact it will soon be zero.

6826 2018-06-05 10:44:21 @onimisiadaba So I'm listening to your programme right now from PH. Your guest is very correct to assert that 33BSCF is non commercial for Shell. I work for a marginal oil coy and we cumulatively exported 50BSCF in 5 quick years (2012 to 2017).

6860 2018-06-05 10:39:29 Curious to see if it holds. Oil is an outright short in my mind after breaking the main uptrend channel. There may be bounces but 61.8 is likely imo. It’s where the main gaps are
6861 2018-06-05 10:39:29 Does this mean I won’t be getting my share of the £15m you have diverted from the Nigerian oil co? I was sort of relying on that.

6888 2018-06-05 10:34:54 Criminal Israel is the only state without oil in that region, so what does it do? The obvious: grabs somebody else's land by military power and voila, they have oil! This is the country we are gifting $14+ Billion every year from our taxes! Despicable.

6926 2018-06-05 10:28:52 Thank you. Next government stands at an historic crossroads.Oil's rise towards $100 is quickly reversible. The cost of solar energy is dropping fast, batteries improving- a long term threat to oil. Without strengthening education+growing private sector, Iraq's future is uncertain

6929 2018-06-05 10:27:57 I tried the “Nair Coconut Oil” thingy .. that shit burned my skin. I probably did it wrong, idk. All I know is, I’m too scared to use it again but that’s a waste if it just sits here

6931 2018-06-05 10:27:43 The more and more you squeeze common man by impose more tax you will end up in draining the economy. No FII would be interested neither do start up can survive, forget about SMEs. #Oil #economy
6932 2018-06-05 10:27:31 so, if the MPC put rates up, that would bring the global price of oil down?
6933 2018-06-05 10:27:31 State Bank of India  said the recent surge in crude oil prices is likely to impact the country’s imports & stretch the ongoing fiscal’s current account deficit (CAD) to 2.5 % of the GDP. It is feared that if the trend persists, economic growth will hit a hump.#शिवराज_टैक्स_लूट
6934 2018-06-05 10:27:27 Also, beyond the endangering and enraging of US allies in the Middle East, nuking Iran would also destroy the oil reserves there.

6936 2018-06-05 10:26:29 Any Jalan to get the Lauric Oil data? We hear that Indon CPKO expensive to Malaysian? Is this true? CNO out of Indian must be sizable volume for Food & Olro use.

6938 2018-06-05 10:26:11 Are they forecasting that we are going to (or perhaps already) exceed Seaway Pipeline's capacity to transport crude south to Houston/Gulf Coast? 400M/day used to be a lot of oil, perhaps it is not now.
6939 2018-06-05 10:26:02 For example, how can we bring Leah Sharibu safely without 'unfortunately' giving bribe to BH?  Can we deregulate oil downstream sector, stop price fixing and still ensure prices don't double? How can we solve power problem without 'unprivatizing' some distribution companies?

6944 2018-06-05 10:25:36 California should then pay a much higher price for their products from oil industry.  Any industry your state refuses to support, cost should go up.

6948 2018-06-05 10:25:05 Rodesa is still being paid from our tyre levy for doing nothing and Fmr Minister Peterson solded our oil reserves and today we paying for all those incompetencies? This is beyond party politics but shere human right violation
6949 2018-06-05 10:25:04 How will raising interest rates help fight inflation if that inflation is caused, not by an economy close to capacity driving wage increases but by external oil price hikes? It's a double whammy, adding injury to injury for hard-pressed consumers.

7083 2018-06-05 10:02:22 The shame about this very weak reports from @ReutersWorld is that there is most certainly a story to tell about the links between Kurdistan Referendum and Kirkuk-Iran oil trade, but these reports kill it with this stupid narrative from KDP-PUK spin undergraduates...

7257 2018-06-05 09:32:02 Andy, the effect of the referendum on Sterling exchange rate is just a fact.  About 10% of the price of petrol is because oil's traded in dollars and a pound is 10% less in dollars than it was before.

£1.30/litre today would be £1.17/litre if not for brexit. It'll get worse too.
7258 2018-06-05 09:32:01 Interesting as Speleotherms in caves can form natural curtain like formations but unfortunately they can be damaged by a single touch as oil from human fingers causes water to avoid the formation and it would dry out and degrade.

So no oily men would be allowed in those caves.

7263 2018-06-05 09:31:51 True, Turkana should benefit from oil sales, it being a local resource. However, the entire nation should benefit too. There needs to be a clear and fair resource sharing formula between the national and county governments.

7469 2018-06-05 08:59:20 Olive oil is quite good as a lubricant as well.  If you can get it down enough slathering it up and pulling has worked for me.  Good luck.

Should've just said 'it's because USA are the best at everything. Not only the best but the best there's ever been & the Mexicans would be paying for it, with Iraqi oil money!
7475 2018-06-05 08:58:22 Its legalised theft by the oil companies. This always happens. Oil cost goes up and petrol cost goes up instantly. Oil cost goes down and pump prices stay high.
7476 2018-06-05 08:58:14 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
7477 2018-06-05 08:58:10 Boss, the oil is in Turkana. Turkana are not benefiting from Titanium in Kwale, or tea in Kericho for that matter.  Eat what is yours.

7486 2018-06-05 08:56:33 Fuck you.... With olive oil... 
7487 2018-06-05 08:56:24 Perceptions are a wonderful thing aren’t they? I don’t see Scotland as being ‘dictated to’. I see us having a powerful devolved parliament within the safety net of a pooling & sharing UK system(well demonstrated when oil collapsed) what’s odd to me is wanting Indi ruled by EU
7488 2018-06-05 08:56:15 Of course it's not as simple as crude oil prices, there are other costs in production such as staff wage rises, equipment  maintenance costs. The rises do seem excessive.
7489 2018-06-05 08:55:34 The oil will go straight into the teabhati wayi
7490 2018-06-05 08:55:11 They get subsidies, and tax breaks are subsidies. It has been estimated that half the US oil industry would be bankrupt without subsidies.
7491 2018-06-05 08:55:09 Hmm... Palm oil and coconut milk, shrimp and crabs, dabbed with scotch bonnet sauce. 

There's so much I need to try...
7492 2018-06-05 08:54:58 No. You are missing è point I'm making. In the 8 yrs of è  previous administration,we only witnessed 2 years of significant crude oil price drops on è international market. Meanwhile we kept bashing them, asking for price reduction throughout the 8 yrs,not just in 2015 and 2016.
7493 2018-06-05 08:54:46 Not as much as getting cooking oil on your eyelid
7494 2018-06-05 08:54:46 Mr.President, the fastest way to conquer Iran mollah regime is to embargo IRAN oil, to cut the supreme leader earnings which will be using for the export of extreme Islam and violence to the Middle East countries and not for the people of Iran. @realDonaldTrump #IranOilEmbargo

7500 2018-06-05 08:53:41 Man you don't get the math do you? The crude oil in international markets was 30 dollars and some change and it was being sold in India about 35 rupees and now it's being sell about 75 despite the fact crude oil costs same as 2004. I wish u really had sold tea in past. Lol

7519 2018-06-05 08:50:41 I'm always asking myself why crude oil affects petrol prices instead of coal affecting it because they make oil from coal fuel from natural gas. Something doesn't add up here

7523 2018-06-05 08:49:29 More evidence of improved project execution in the oil and gas sector. Shell brings Kaikias onstream one year ahead of schedule, while capturing a 30% reduction in costs post-FID. Four years from discovery to first production is an exceptionally quick turn-around.

7527 2018-06-05 08:48:52 Canada produces and refines petroleum products but the pump prices are higher than ours. Oil revenue should be used to improve infrastructure and provide social support to the citizens, not to enable them to drive cars.

7545 2018-06-05 08:46:05 He’s speaking from a biased view point that’s the whole problem with this out dated debate. People need to look on the positive a bit more. All food can come from other counties outside the EU and he’ll maybe we can refine our own oil.
7546 2018-06-05 08:46:02 I dont think ive ever seen this sub £10m cap. Still its justified, they have to start making hay whilst the price of oil sunshines. If they do this will be seen as cheap #HYR

7553 2018-06-05 08:44:39 Further, consider Alaska's oil/resource dividends -- these are certainly not hurting the poor more. The US shd likewise have resource dividends -- one of them might conceivably be fully-rebated carbon taxes. at least theoretically, these would NOT be regressive, but net income.

7560 2018-06-05 08:42:39 Lost 1/3rd of share price since April. I assume the market wants more detail. State that oil is being stored then sold and shipped, how many barrels, what’s the current flow and is it expected to diminish etc? We don’t know how long 270 or 315bopd flowed for. More detail needed.

Take more time. Immerse  yourself.
7580 2018-06-05 08:39:35 you reminded me of a conversation I had with a very old scientist back in the 80's. He said the same thing then, that there were alternatives being found all the time, but the Oil co's buy the rights to ensure they're never used.

June 18 oil is $75/barrel - Deisel £1.30 + 

So the price rises with oil prices but doesn't drop at the same rate . Surely this is the real story ?
7600 2018-06-05 08:36:22 Besides, you can't make hydrogen in your house, but you CAN have solar panels and windmills. Hydrogen is Shell's and other oil company's favourite solution for a reason. Think about it.
7601 2018-06-05 08:36:13 Like the oil industry? You should definitely have a word with them about that. Tsk tsk.

7607 2018-06-05 08:35:28 Thats wonderful to hear! Oil and edibles are just lovely. Its incredible how it helps your muscles ease a bit  too right? Just love it!

7624 2018-06-05 08:32:19 Hardly an impartial article is it? What about the increasing oil prices and a weak pound adding 6p a ltr to fuel in UK. And we still don't have a clue on a final deal - and neither do the Tories.

7633 2018-06-05 08:29:47 You can use Turmeric instead, is cheaper and give similar results. With fish, you can fry some onions in a pan with olive oil. After a couple of minutes add saffron with a spoon of flour and mix it. Finally add some Broth and use a mixer to have a nice sauce.

7672 2018-06-05 08:21:41 The fact is petrol is a free by product at refineries that we need and they and the government know it. They hold months if oil stock yet immediately impose price increases when they aren't affected fir months. Its legalised profiteering and the government take a share.

Also privet, although I don't know if privet is available as a fragrance, essential oil, etc.

7798 2018-06-05 07:56:50 Sorry I should also have added: Profiteering by oil companies.

Increase price immediately when oil prices increase. Hold back on price drop if oil prices decrease.

I know of no other answers to your question. 

Take Care.
7799 2018-06-05 07:56:34 Abeg that's not the best measure. Oil is like 9% of Nigeria's GDP after all.
7800 2018-06-05 07:55:52 We know massive deadly oil spills are created  after tankers or drilling rigs have accidents but in fact, for every  million tons of oil shipped, there is always one ton of oil spilled –  without any accident.

7811 2018-06-05 07:54:35 You do know that the main obstacle to turning us into "Venezuela, but without the oil" is the EU regulation limiting PM Corbyn's powers, yes? And that's why he supports Brexit?

7864 2018-06-05 07:43:50 Are we the only oil producing country to be poorer when crude oil prices rise? If oil is traded in dollars, to our continual detriment, break that tie.  Play Trump at his own game. Stand up for ourselves.

7883 2018-06-05 07:39:43 Wow! realised i belong to a ring-fenced community - bound to get special treatment as one of many denied a gas supply & have to use oil or heat.

7892 2018-06-05 07:36:57 I tried giving Cane’s a second chance but their chicken had that same smell/taste of old burnt fryer oil that they don’t change.
7893 2018-06-05 07:36:39 I dont see any parallel. Its not hard to pass oil and gas projects in Canada. Look at Keystone XL (transcanada) and LNG Canada that petronas is now apart of. In fact PM JT is discreetly known to side with oil and gas players. Like his Conservative predecessors. Anyhow, thanks.
7894 2018-06-05 07:36:34 Yes! My mum is heavily into automatic time-release essential oil diffusers.
I loathe them. Horrid sickly sweet things.
I'd rather just smell fresh air. If the room is a bit musty, then either clean it or open a goddamn window.

7899 2018-06-05 07:35:16 How is it going to impact on oil prices locally? Do we expect prices of  petrol or diesel to cone down?

7902 2018-06-05 07:34:56 Plugging in reduces emissions hugely, as refining oil to to gasoline uses LOTS of elec. So better to use that elec to just power a car. 25 miles in a Tesla = electric used to refine oil to 1 gallon. Electric is the way forward. Less cars also very important!

7910 2018-06-05 07:33:58 This doesn’t make sense. Country hurt most by oil falling is US, not Russia or Canada? Really? Also, Russia loses 10bps if oil falls, but gains 50bps if oil gains. Huh?
7911 2018-06-05 07:33:53 I’d think tree oil was going to burn, I don’t really use any creams other than vitamin C ,coconut oil or aloe vera in the summer on my skin, ps. I don’t wear expensive make up haha

7923 2018-06-05 07:30:31 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.

7949 2018-06-05 07:24:15 Phew, we can all relax then. Jonathan Martin doesn't give the models & conclusions produced by NASA, Royal Society, Harvard, MIT, UNSW, UQ, Melbourne Uni, Oxford et al any credence. Lets build more over-priced coal power stations & give $ to the middle east for oil.
7950 2018-06-05 07:24:00 I agree with you, however people are becoming the very thing they hate, some people comment certain things & it sounds childish. Not all of them are bad and if this country & America stayed out of their country and bought the oil instead of stealing it.

India has to FIRST buy US$, THEN buy oil/gas with those dollars. We cannot pay in rupees. 
The benefit to exporters of a weaker rupee would be a) small b) temporary.

8027 2018-06-05 07:09:31 how can petrol cost £1.30 a litre “because oil is now at $80 a barrel”?? oil used to be $130 a barrel and petrol was nowhere near £1.30 a litre

8036 2018-06-05 07:08:09 Disagree. China has a HUMONGOUS trade surplus. India has a HUGE trade deficit (largely because of Oil&Gas imports. The reason a strong rupee benefits us is because of trade deficit. A weaker rupee would lead to inflation.

8131 2018-06-05 06:48:27 Lol, you didn't have to go that way. Probably you think I'm an outsider talking about Warri, but I was actually born and raised in Warri, still based there. Seeing Warri before and then now, things have really dilapidated, with big oil companies departing Warri.
8132 2018-06-05 06:48:26 Could be he worked away from home a lot (on oil rigs for example) or was in the military. It wouldn't be an uncommon situation for the kids to live with grandparents in that case.

8135 2018-06-05 06:47:28 Once again, it’s about shipping oil to Asia and clearly the price of oil such from the belly of an Aframax Oil Tanker is not the same as light oil, nor is there a business case for it to Asia for borrowing 4.5 to 20B from taxpayers....cart / horse.

8140 2018-06-05 06:46:34 #Scotland contributes substantially to #UK tax revenues.

1. Can we start carrying water in stainless steel bottles.
It can be filled in home office and public places
2. Buy groceries including oil in unpacked form. Have steel containers get it filled in shop.
Groceries in seperate cloth bags for buying.
8166 2018-06-05 06:43:20 Just myopic advice.  if stopping the expansion of offshore oil and gas increases emissions then you're not using your imagination.
8167 2018-06-05 06:43:18 Monsoon has come, employment will increase! How? Haven’t you heard the old one ‘When it rains in India, it becomes the duty of vegetables to cover themselves with besan and jump in a kadai full of hot oil.’
8168 2018-06-05 06:43:11 "I have enough work on my hands, and oil is such a vital resource..."

8176 2018-06-05 06:42:23 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8177 2018-06-05 06:42:20 I agree with oil & used it my whole life and will for years. I Have friends making a living from it. All I’m asking is we open ourselves to the conversation of other forms of energy & a conservation plan for oil so we don’t waste it if we don’t need to. This can create more jobs
8178 2018-06-05 06:42:09 @alykhansatchu Will the export of Kenyan oil ultimately strengthen the value of the Kenyan Shilling ?
8179 2018-06-05 06:42:05 Yes I remember... And @WayneKoda finds shrews drowned in water in the bottom of crisp packets. I guess the oil on the sides of the bags makes it too slippery for them to climb out. Horrible death at the hands of Man again

8204 2018-06-05 06:38:28 We are not good at collective responsibility, unless oil, profit and war is involved. Trumps isolationism and Trump and Turnbull’s climate change scepticism doesn’t help.

8227 2018-06-05 06:34:29 No, Brent Crude is a light crude as is West Texas. Oil Sands crude is heavy and requires refineries with cokers, due to the high sulfur content. They are not the same and they do not demand the same price. Where's Asia's order with the price they're going to pay?
8228 2018-06-05 06:34:23 Ok, will not give time to this tweet. But I saw somewhere Kenyans who discovered their oil in 2012 exported their first barrel already. Think this is more significant than glorifying Omuk. Kabalega. Hangiriza Agutamba.

8252 2018-06-05 06:31:30 What about those of use who are denied a gas supply and have to use oil for heating? We're always excluded from debates on fuel costs and are receiving no help at all with what is a double whammy for us at present?

8262 2018-06-05 06:29:29 With 600B,Kenya would have modernised changamwe oil refinery to a world class refinery with humongous capacity that would rival other gulf nations refineries.Uganda with its meagre resources floated a 250B tender for a standard oil refinery
8263 2018-06-05 06:29:28 Funny how you didn't show the prices since 2012 when you were elected. Going down? I don't think so. How can we trust a snake oil salesman who thinks the electorate are such idiots as to notice who was in power since 2012?

Both are “fat”. What about heated fat vs non heated, etc. More precision needed.

8395 2018-06-05 06:09:41 Equity in near term reminds me of dialogue from Mugal E Azam where Akbar tells Anarkali

8402 2018-06-05 06:08:44 Well said, but I believe power of oil, US, people’s sentiment (2019) is little stronger than the bull factors. What do you say?
8403 2018-06-05 06:08:37 oil started falling the very next day after you thought you lost your mojo!
8404 2018-06-05 06:08:25 With olive oil ? I can't find then now.
8405 2018-06-05 06:08:00 Azerbaijan has just like 30 years of crude oil left, and now want to transit to logistics based economy...

* How many years does Nigeria left with crude oil?
* What does Nigeria wants to transit to?
8406 2018-06-05 06:07:56 Kenya is set to be an exporter of oil...wrong. She will be an exporter of CRUDE oil. Which subsequently results to exportation of jobs and a valuable resource at its original form. Isn't Kenya in a capacity to process oil?

8414 2018-06-05 06:07:04 Filing off chipped edges and applying nail polish helps. Keeping them moisturized with olive oil or coconut oil also. I've always had the trashiest nails and this always does the trick for me.

8430 2018-06-05 06:04:51 This discussion was on NPA and you successfully brought other factors like a true Pidi. How is it that you expect chamatkar when first basic things need improvement? You talk about fuel prices. Do you know government has been able to pay off oil loans accrued by your CONgress?
8431 2018-06-05 06:04:46 Haa india mai prices bade hai petrol ke uske kuch reasons hai did you know ki congress ne hame petrol toh cheap price me diya lekin uske wajah se india par kitne liabilities hai oil companies ki

8449 2018-06-05 06:01:44 As you've said, it's a virtue signal. Sounds cliche but that's what it is. A real step would be restricting used imports and setting tougher vehicle emissions targets. We use none of our oil for transport, it's quality is too high

8462 2018-06-05 06:00:44 But is that just because we’ve gotten better at extracting more resources, specifically energy dense resources such as coal and oil which has enabled us, at least for the time being, to attain improved standards of living?

8471 2018-06-05 05:59:54 Not a great prescription. Writer assumes saving of Rs 1 lac cr on oil imports by 10% INR appreciation. Am no economist, but feel that would deal a body blow to exports and manufacturing, and cause job losses that would hurt India way more than what it theoretically would save.

8478 2018-06-05 05:58:30 I take krill oil instead of fish oil since the capsules are smaller. I like sublingual supplements a lot, but it's hard to find them.

8503 2018-06-05 05:53:46 1.Oil companies bought that oil and the companies paid it. Govt tax revenue has nothing to do with it
2. You are talking about 43,000 only the tax collected is 10 lakh

 For argument's sake let's say Feku paid that 43,000 then where'svthe remaining 9.57 lakh? 
8504 2018-06-05 05:53:36 Absurd. “Unwealthy countries” are unwealthy usually because their people chose to not to work and sell raw oil instead, funneling profits to corrupt elites instead of populace.
8505 2018-06-05 05:53:35 The @imperialcollege study says campaigns by NGOs will not stop forest destruction for #palmoil  Simply banning palm oil production or applying pressure to countries is not an answer. Nor are NGO shaming campaigns and unilateral adoption of commitments by individual companies

8540 2018-06-05 05:46:48 Cbd oil is legal under the 2014 farm bill. You just can’t have cbd oil with thc in it. Which lots of places make those but those are traditionally at dispensaries :-)
8541 2018-06-05 05:46:46 Retweeted The Zambian (@TNazi):

So the price of oil has picked up and the Kwacha has dropped in value. We should get a fuel price hike shortly. The only question is "when? "

1. Can we start carrying water in stainless steel bottles.
It can be filled in home office and public places
2. Buy groceries including oil in unpacked form. Have steel containers get it filled in shop.
Groceries in seperate cloth bags for buying.
8543 2018-06-05 05:45:54 When life wakes you up and hands you fresh turnip greens, cold jasmine rice, black bean/chili sauce, oil and a skillet, you make the best midnight snack ever.

8622 2018-06-05 05:32:24 The devastation this causes is heart-breaking. I try to remember to check for palm oil and if it’s present I leave it on the shelf. Ive heard that sometimes it’s hidden behind vague terms like ‘vegetable oil’.

8677 2018-06-05 05:22:03 This would honestly rule, apart from the devastating economic downturn that would accompany big oil companies shitting the bed

8680 2018-06-05 05:21:47 The 2016 post-election divestment of Rosneft was primarily financed by Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo. Then Rosneft immediately invested in a project with ENI, the Italian government controlled oil company. ENI is the only US or EU oil company doing new deals with Rosneft.

8696 2018-06-05 05:18:48 Would you go to the bakery to get the oil changed in your car?  Of course you wouldn’t.  You shouldn’t go to a website that sells advertising for banking institutions and expect a correct credit report and score either.  Only the big 3 bureaus or a mortgage partner can help you.

The cooking sheet should have foil on it that's been lightly greased with oil, personally I use extra virgin olive oil, but others should work.

Does it matter what other oils or other stuff they're mixed with, too? My Vit D is in coconut oil. Hemp oil is just itself w/ some mint for flavor. a cbd variety lists "grapeseed oil, sunflower lecithin" before it.

8720 2018-06-05 05:14:51 I believe that the tax should be a fixed amount and not a percentage of the total price. That way the tax amount won't of up when the oil price increases. Conversely, tax amount will stay constantly when the oil price goes down. This way treasury can properly budget revenue.

8727 2018-06-05 05:13:33 Here in Texas wind power saved our tails when the coal plants froze in winter, and when they burned up in summer. It’s so cheap residences get no-cost electricity at nights and weekends, to use the surplus.

In Texas panhandle, gas and oil wells use solar arrays for power.
8728 2018-06-05 05:13:31 Sir 
US oil rig count rose to 861 (highest in almost 3 years). By next year US will be largest producer in world which is bad news for Saudi and Russia. If Saudi and Russia wants to drive crude oil market in coming days than they have to increase production, means low price again

Particularly given the other great, young, liberal hope is going to suck 173bn barrels of oil out of the Canadian permafrost
8733 2018-06-05 05:11:49 Friedman actually advised them not to do anything with North Sea Oil except maybe give everyone £1. In the event, much of it was used to keep millions unemployed rather than invest in UK industry infrastructure
8734 2018-06-05 05:11:47 We need sustained higher crude oil prices to bring back investment and employment in our destroyed offshore oil and gas industry ... thousands of jobs have been lost and exploration almost at zero

8813 2018-06-05 04:59:47 20 benefits of coconut oil:
#9. Improves Digestion and Reduces Stomach Ulcers and Ulcerative Colitis. It also improves digestion as it helps the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins, calcium and magnesium. #veganstrong #livethatlife
8814 2018-06-05 04:59:22 @TuckerCarlson hey Tucker...please research why they call oil and gas "fossil fuels"...if true..we must have run out of dinosaur bones for oil by know....right?

8816 2018-06-05 04:59:14 ใช่ ตั้งแต่เมื่อคืนละ ยังไม่หยุดเลย
8817 2018-06-05 04:59:08 High fiber foods like grains in general inhibit absorption of fatty acids, fat soluble vitamins, & minerals so granola would also decrease absorption of THC or CBD oil.

8819 2018-06-05 04:59:01 Solar panels less toxic than coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Solar panels less toxic than oil wells, pipelines, refining and shipping.  Wind power often precludes battery need, but less toxic batteries are now available to store solar; toxicity zip if recycled well.
8820 2018-06-05 04:58:49 Leaving this oil heater on in the office izolo was actually a GREAT idea 
8821 2018-06-05 04:58:42 I wake up.
My friend who runs the oil company, has his head blown off.

Then someone I know and all my friends know walks up to me and say's

I can have you killed for $5000.

How do you think I feel about that?
8822 2018-06-05 04:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8823 2018-06-05 04:58:07 Oil prices are low & tourism sky rocketed. I want to blow my savings into one these hotels here cause that residual oh man 
8824 2018-06-05 04:57:46 *whispers* You can pretty much use any oil/lotion as makeup remover if needed

Also 20,000 years of practice comes in handy at some point ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

8829 2018-06-05 04:55:45 Mossadeq had become extremely unpopular and hated by the time he was removed due to failure to reach oil deal and restore the economy, his dissolution of parliament and democratic institutions and helping communist spread, even Mossadeq own National Front was divided
8830 2018-06-05 04:55:43 Why shd there be tax for swachch bharat? Then Delhi shd impose swachch hawa tax! BJP will impose non-hindu tax, if re-elected. Where's end? Oil prices are rigged like elections used to be! But ingenious plots are being employed to circumvent EVMs by jugaad! This is Aurangzeb rule
8831 2018-06-05 04:55:40 Iran announces they will take up enriching uranium again.

Thank you, @realDonaldTrump. This one is on you.

And as oil prices rise when Iranian oil gets sanctioned, Russia enjoy revenues that can support their military ambitions.

8846 2018-06-05 04:53:17 The oil from his face was sacrificed to the troops. They were able to oil all of their machinery for an entire fiscal quarter.
8847 2018-06-05 04:53:08 My ladder broke today..flipped off a porch and had a hair-full of oil based paint 

It’s been one hell of a Monday
8848 2018-06-05 04:53:05 .....With Mexico, US economic relation is worst, since 2003 remittances from US to Mexico surpassed Mexico GDP, Mexico economy highest source of Income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture, etc.
Mexico economy has a total dependence on the US......
8849 2018-06-05 04:52:54 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
8850 2018-06-05 04:52:35 Liar. She didnt say that. He was a energy consultant on oil & gas fields in Israel & had experience on how regional politics will affect the industry.
8851 2018-06-05 04:51:54 Hey Moms... did any of you guys try castor oil

8853 2018-06-05 04:51:30 If you wear falsies, always put coconut oil on your lashes after you take them off!! Helps them grow and less likely for your natural lashes to fall off :)
8854 2018-06-05 04:50:55 Has he or you looked into CBD oil? I have anxiety and found that cbd oil has reduced it quite a bit plus I like because it's all natural and not a doctor prescribed medicine that can be addicting.
8855 2018-06-05 04:50:52 Hmmmm big titty oil wrestling lol
8856 2018-06-05 04:50:48 Only a leftist could be confused about something so simple. People would not have voted for Labour or the Greens had they known her promise not to halt oil exploration was a lie. She lied to win votes. Votes that would have gone elsewhere had she been truthful. She is a fake PM.
8857 2018-06-05 04:49:53 Hope this tea tree oil work ASAP
8858 2018-06-05 04:49:52 Damn! I love Tiger Balm! I also use the Watkins medicated ointment- I am interested in the CBD oil as well- besides the arthritic relief, I have been looking into it for depression/anxiety as well. I am glad to hear that you are off the meds Mr Dan!

8864 2018-06-05 04:48:43 You can’t simultaneously admit that Carroll worked for the Greens (and with Obbink) and that his statements are worthless or that everything he says is false. He may be a snake oil salesman, but he does still know *some* things.
8865 2018-06-05 04:48:33 Why against more oil & gas permits?
8866 2018-06-05 04:48:24 I made my own rose/lavender water. Added some oil scents in it.. Voila.. Beautiful.

8871 2018-06-05 04:47:16 And even more of that plastic will be made from the Alberta oil from that pipeline you want so badly. Time to say enough is enough.
8872 2018-06-05 04:47:11 Guess they wanted a bit of variety by adding a Snake Oil salesman!
8873 2018-06-05 04:47:09 Hi you currently used what type of cleansing oil?

8881 2018-06-05 04:46:34 So if you live in the east coast you don't get cancer or have autism...  I'd think all the pesticides and chemicals in the food we eat have more of an inpact than a contained oil spill of 10L, but maybe not
8882 2018-06-05 04:46:23 べんりなOILってだめなの？本当はちきゅうによくないの？アフリカでケータイのために戦争がまだつづいてるって、本当？でんきがないとふべんだよ。でもフロンガスもふえてるよ。あ～べんり、でも ちょっとオセンち。それでももっとべんりになりた～い！！ / PARADOX体操 #RIZE
8883 2018-06-05 04:46:22 Not true.  German production never exceeded the Soviet Union and only barely surpassed Britain.  Oil and steel production was critically low.  Germany was on the defensive and losing ground before the Western Front opened.  It would be harder without Allied intelligence for sure
8884 2018-06-05 04:46:16 need a full body massage ...the oil &  everything....
8885 2018-06-05 04:46:12 Sanele needs to take me through the oil cleansing again. I got my coconut oil, sweet almond oil and grapeseed oil izolo. Ndiready

8902 2018-06-05 04:42:54 #Health #tip : #Popcorn is a healthy snack and has more antioxidants than fruits and vegetables. Just limit the amount as it can be quite rich if it’s cooked in oil or has butter on it. To limit the calories try the “air-popped” version.

Because he knows without even having to make his rounds through the Mansion that Captain America and Iron Man are still awake...
8904 2018-06-05 04:42:19 & it also would've been good to have this explained when I first started my Vit D oil supplement about a month ago. Instead I learn it while doing that research. 
8905 2018-06-05 04:41:49 Hahahahha u nk oil utk ape?
8906 2018-06-05 04:41:48 You know oil production doubled under obamas terms.  Paling may have said drill baby drill, but ibaka actually did it
8907 2018-06-05 04:41:45 Actually, it’s accurate. Part of the reason oil is up is because of the uncertainty surrounding Iran, specifically, the US pulling out of the nuclear agreement and possible future sanctions that will take Iran oil off the market. Markets hate uncertainty.
8908 2018-06-05 04:41:43 หาดูได้จากไหนคะ ต้องพิมพ์ว่าอะไร
8909 2018-06-05 04:41:17 I was replacing the tires on my bike and had to stop to laugh because it reminded me of a kid from college who only wanted to sleep with me because I knew what a lug nut was and could change my own oil. Which is higher than most peoples’ standards I guess. Carry on.
8910 2018-06-05 04:41:02 Yezzz thanks Sar for the tips!! Btw for cleansing oil from what brand u use
8911 2018-06-05 04:40:53 I recently did a fuckton of research into cbd oil, & the takeaway I had is yes, bioavailability is better when you eat with any oil-based supplement, regardless of whether it's capsules or sublingual (because you still end up swallowing some after 90 secs of it under your tongue)
8912 2018-06-05 04:40:52 Got an oil change today and my car drives so smooth. I fell in love all over again.

8920 2018-06-05 04:39:59 A) Go to the hotel bar, order a bottle of wine and hope you don’t remember the encounter.

B) Call the local EPA and report a massive oil slick.

C) first B, then A.

8922 2018-06-05 04:39:25 My asthma was completely out of control. So I made my own inhalers out of an essential oil mix & kept my rescue inhaler close-by, with a 10-yr-old epinephrine inhaler in case the rescue didn't Work. Then I spent last year's Christmas (all week) when a severe attack hit.
8923 2018-06-05 04:39:22 Maybe sbb nda proper cleansing. Try to wipe the dirt out first using cleansing oil. Then baru guna basic cleanser. This prevents me from breakouts unless i dont have control on taking spicy foods

8925 2018-06-05 04:39:11 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.

8936 2018-06-05 04:36:51 To counter this, they will move the goal posts back and say developed nations.
8937 2018-06-05 04:36:15 Wait the Razor sponsored segement for #RAW is @FinnBalor’s bare chest? Is next week baby oil?
8938 2018-06-05 04:36:09 “For a false economy” ?

Real families with real jobs and livelihoods at risk by this.  Oil is still vital part of the “modern” world, this will have small impact on the global scale of things.

8950 2018-06-05 04:33:44 Highly recommend everyone to see @ChappeIIeShow  black bush skit about oil 
8951 2018-06-05 04:33:30 Yes David the medical marijuana oil is the best. Not only good for pain but it does prolong the progress of cancers.
8952 2018-06-05 04:33:13 The new coal mines are different, much cleaner burning, etc. Can't say the same for oil, that's still bad.

I don't necessarily like the drilling either but it's cheaper than most alternatives.

I agree oil/sugar recommendation were based on poor evidence..without ample large RCTs..n have been slowly reversed..one of the reasons bar for FDA approval shd be higher.(currently 3 sigma in 1 RCT |2 sigma in 2)

8962 2018-06-05 04:31:33 Crazy week. 135 straight waking hours, then finally slept 6. Have now been up since 6:30am Sunday. Made FL-TX run in 15.5 hours. Took car for State Inspection, oil change after arriving. Played w/boys, ate Braum’s/In n Out combo. I’ll be driving them back for Beach/WDW vacay Wed.
8963 2018-06-05 04:31:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet total chaos and lawlessness.
8964 2018-06-05 04:31:03 The government of Tuvalu has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Jon Heder in a felt wig.
8965 2018-06-05 04:30:46 Yeah the asprin and the water but if that’s not working add the tea oil on the bump first and then put the asprin on. You’re gonna see your skin peeling. That means it’s working so just peal it off & you’re welcome hun. & ohh yeah I still clean it first with the sea salt.
8966 2018-06-05 04:30:39 Could you imagine how much more baby oil @JoeyRyanOnline would put in there?

8972 2018-06-05 04:29:42 And now? @MBuhari is stealing more than any leader ever stole before. Oil lifting contracts to 50 halfwitted cronies is only the tip of the iceberg. How did Aisha the masseuse buy 2 UK flats in Edgeware Road and Regents Park? Since 2015?

8977 2018-06-05 04:29:25 I use a roller ball from young living, but you can get essential oils from almost anywhere, including some pharmacies. You may need to dilute with some coconut oil as it’s very strong. Apply to temples and back of neck. I’ll DM you some info

8983 2018-06-05 04:27:44 My first day of internship resulted in me ruining a shirt with coconut oil, getting lost 10 times, almost falling asleep during lecture, and ending up drunk and in bed by 11:30. So overall a successful Monday.

8990 2018-06-05 04:26:30 Octavia E. Butler works up her novels like an oil painting, layering, leaving space, whole other others are throwing all sorts of inconsequential details, saying more while saying less
8991 2018-06-05 04:26:26 Because it's 100% Hitman 2/Season 2. The car says Hamsun Oil, that's from Hitman and the K on the pit suits is Kronstadt Industries aka both are Ken Morgan, the 6th target in Hitman's latest games, companies.

8993 2018-06-05 04:26:25 Then propose a solution that actually works instead of snake oil. You always find reasons to blame inanimate objects but never the people that use them. How well did banning drugs and alcohol work for us? Add yet another expensive law to put more people behind bars
8994 2018-06-05 04:26:18 I’m going this way after first trying to read about all the human studies with soybean oil cooking and health implications & guess what? 

There are only a handful of reasonable human studies in pubmed on soybean oil

8998 2018-06-05 04:25:34 Like I said. Twenty years 100 passengers. Going to be a lot of oil needed before then
8999 2018-06-05 04:24:50 And your solution is throwing thousands of public sector workers out of jobs? That would help the economy? AB is enjoying a much better recovery than Saskatchewan which followed conservative solutions to the collapse in oil prices.
9000 2018-06-05 04:24:45 no but it’s leaking where the engine & tranny meet u know wut I’m talking bout there’s prolly a crack or sum ima do a whole oil change & throw in some sealer & hope it works

9012 2018-06-05 04:23:09 I’m going to stop using a hair brush unless I need to pull my hair back for professional reasons.

Also, when I run out of my Biore face wash in a couple weeks, I’m going to try an oil cleanser.

This summer is all about refreshing my hair and skin

9015 2018-06-05 04:22:23 If global emissions are not reduced by the ban and kiwi jobs are lost, as apparently is the case, then the policy is truly nuts.    The Stone Age did not end because of a shortage of stones.   Ditto for coal and oil

9017 2018-06-05 04:21:59 I thought there was water in my hose between the pump and gauge. Turns out it is the oil used in the pumping mechanism. It seems that in the low pressure environment, the oil vaporizes and backfills into the vacuum chamber.

9019 2018-06-05 04:21:56 water and oil don’t mix
9020 2018-06-05 04:21:51 It’s mindless. Canadians use oil but don’t want oil? Want foreign oil? Not Canadian oil? Want oil but not pipeline oil? What the hell do they want OIL VIA OSMOSIS????
9021 2018-06-05 04:21:48 Oil dropped $64.65/Barrel @PutinRF_Eng @KremlinRussia_E @MedvedevRussiaE @mod_russia @M_Simonyan !!
9022 2018-06-05 04:21:48 many of us are done with "trusting docs". that's the point. you want blind semitic faith in #allopathy. and you have blind faith in latest fads, based on faked data. this is how you end up in monumental blunders like "coconut oil bad, olive oil good", and "fat bad, sugar good"
9023 2018-06-05 04:21:47 Why fight for the aluminum industry? Is it because most production is from the largest Liberal electorate? Why does Lafarge have a CO2 waiver while pipelines can’t be built due to last minute CO2 regulatory additions? What about support for oil & gas? Your hypocrisy never ends!
9024 2018-06-05 04:21:25 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.

9042 2018-06-05 04:18:21 God chose you not in spite of your cracks, but because of them!! So that people will not value the vessel, but the oil inside of it.
9043 2018-06-05 04:18:13 Are they not intertwined? Culture wars have been going on since before we were a nation. They were about race also about money. Trade wars would lead to economic instability. That would be oil in the flames of culture wars. Trump really is Putin’s useful idiot.

Trump did a great job making the USA energy independent and soon to be the largest energy producer in the world. Coal plays a part on the world stage. High paying jobs!

9104 2018-06-05 04:08:11 Seriously, why do you call this Shane’s “New” flat-Earth theory? It’s just his brother regurgitating a bunch of flat-Earth talking points from followers of a snake oil salesman from the 1800s.
9105 2018-06-05 04:07:40 Vzla. will default in all commitments before touching those to Russia and China under 'oil for cash' loans. When it cuts those, you can bet the organic fertilizer hit the rotating ventilator.

The most recent Quarterly Business Indicators by @ABSStats shows the #mining industry (including #oil and #gas) set a new record high of $30.3 billion of gross operating profit in the Mar 2018 quarter. This is the highest of any #Aus industry since #data began in 1994
9107 2018-06-05 04:07:29 Drove to Cleveland today to train AML consultants for the bank. Roth did +1.87% on a huge $CGC move and the oil short cooked a bit more. New $DWT position is +27%. Small trim coming this week. May get a Summer oil bump but looking for low $60's after that.

9117 2018-06-05 04:06:07 July heating oil closed down 243 points at $2.1520 today. Prices closed near the session low and hit a three-week low today. Given the steep losses in crude oil, it's also likely heating oil has topped out, too. The bulls still have the overall near-term technical advantage.

They have some nice ideas and surely some smart individuals, but as a whole seem to drastically underperform expectations given their resources
9121 2018-06-05 04:05:44 Letting my rosewater set into my skin before I apply my oil. Sipping water and wishing I had midnight snacks, but I’m *not* better than that
9122 2018-06-05 04:05:14 July Nymex crude oil closed down $0.93 at $64.88 today. Prices closed nearer the session low. The recent steep downdraft still suggests a major market top is in place.

9130 2018-06-05 04:03:57 Carbon Dividend Plan is great Only thing not real clear in the video was that the fee is collected at the port, the wellhead and the mine. Fee is based on how much pollution will come from the source, so coal pays the most-then oil and gas the least. that's where the money's from

9153 2018-06-05 04:00:15 @McDonalds - would you ever consider changing your cooking oil to an allergen-free one? Soy allergy is so common in the US, and most with it can't have soybean oil. You use sunflower and rapeseed in other countries.

9186 2018-06-05 03:54:23 This is straight from the gut. Not research based. Oil needs outside are unmet in all the places there is no data. The 75MMbl of excess crude in US has been difficult to export. Brent will move violently without warning.

9190 2018-06-05 03:54:03 it’s richness would pair well with a blistered tomato salad imho? try frying a pint of cherry tomatoes in hot oil until some of them burst with tarragon. pan sear the cod with liberal salt and pepper; serve with arugula and crusty bread
9191 2018-06-05 03:54:03 dont forget the thousands of acres of national monuments leased to oil and gas and coal companies the endangered species losing protection from hunting the the national wilderness opened to oil drilling the rights of workers to sue unsafe workplaces together torn away from them.
9192 2018-06-05 03:54:02 Govt announced with great fanfare early this year introducing BS VI petrol and diesel in Delhi. Indian Oil website states that site work has just started at its various refineries. Is this fuel imported just to show early introduction of BS VI?
9193 2018-06-05 03:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

9207 2018-06-05 03:52:06 Lots wrong. Tar is a man made product from petroleum distillate process. The steam is recycled water to lessen environmental impact & each mine is restored to boreal forest after resources are extracted. The land is actually better because the oil has been removed.
9208 2018-06-05 03:52:01 In its natural state, the grain itself is poisonous to humans. It is altered to reduce the toxicity.  You ask do not get oil from those seeds by squeezing them, it is chemically extracted.

9233 2018-06-05 03:46:44 We know CA had access to Facebook data and I make that clear in the book. Its just they probably never used it in the way that Nix intended, because the 'psychological warfare' weapons were snake oil.
9234 2018-06-05 03:46:43 Your diet is a fossil fuel driven machine and the oil companies and gmo companies are lovin it!
9235 2018-06-05 03:46:35 Dude same. It took a solid two hours before I noticed the oil had actually done something lol. Plus chronic pain = fucked up pain baseline
9236 2018-06-05 03:46:25 baby oil?

9238 2018-06-05 03:46:21 Shea Moisture Clarifying Facial Wash & Scrub for cleansing, Alba Botanical’s 2% salicylic acid spot treatment or tea tree oil diluted with face oil also helps with problem acne, raw aloe for soothing, witch hazel (Thayers is my fav) as a toner, and Bentonite Clay as a detox mask
9239 2018-06-05 03:46:18 Getting a massage @MassageEnvy can go 2 ways: 1) get a zen massage therapist that really has technique and knows how to press all the right spots or 2) get a tattooed weirdo who simply shleps oil all over y in a relentless circular motion. I hate that Selina left 
9240 2018-06-05 03:46:06 Hair growth oil stuff works really well no joke
9241 2018-06-05 03:45:57 Girrrl get you a heating pad  that shits rough. & also tea tree oil mixed with olive oil helps sometimes.
9242 2018-06-05 03:45:50 Coming to you guys next time. They just turned my car into a lemon cause they forgot to put oil it...when I came in for an oil change.
9243 2018-06-05 03:45:46 Blend 3 cups Cantaloupe with 4 1/2 tbsps daily bread. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve with salmon
9244 2018-06-05 03:45:33 Yes, but that was for Matt's esteem's own good, so....
9245 2018-06-05 03:45:29 Shutdown by *whom*? Who has the power to override the largest military powers on earth if they feel like missing their 2C targets. The logic is backwards. Blocking pipelines is an attempt to strand oil, not the other way around.
9246 2018-06-05 03:45:22 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

9251 2018-06-05 03:44:20 them free enterprise, hard working critics like to spend their work days on Twitter pretending to be entrepreneurs... An oil patch entrepreneur in Canada always has his hand out for the next juicy subsidy from our @OilGasCanada-captured governments... #weak
9252 2018-06-05 03:44:14 So what is the concern? If the pipeline is unused, there will be no tankers, and ergo no marine risk or spills. The risk is only present so long as the oil is shipping. If the concern is we may choose to halt shipments in future, then we retain that option.

9258 2018-06-05 03:43:14 Not only that, he gets inspiration from Venezuela, a country that has completely collapsed. People starving, currency collapsed, have to import oil now. This is what he wants to turn Canada into. Insanity.

9260 2018-06-05 03:43:02 Now that Kenya will be an oil exporter my prayer is that the dragon of corruption will be stopped on its tracks before rearing its ugly head into that important sector.
9261 2018-06-05 03:42:44 I wonder if anyone care about our ecosystem...and our aquafers laced with crude oil..or dead indigenous people that tried to protect it.
9262 2018-06-05 03:42:26 Yup! Thinking on that same line too. 
The Queen of Hypocrites -Oil Salesman feigns ignorance.

9267 2018-06-05 03:41:54 I grew up only knowing of Steven Harper, the Canadian prime minster at the time. I only knew him as a guy, but in reality he was a guy that sold off national parks to mining companies and let the oil sands dictate what the county did. Life was simple when we were kids.

9276 2018-06-05 03:40:38 .@SecBenDiokno: Major oil exporting countries are already discussing the possibility of increasing production. When they do this, we know this will bring down the cost of our oil imports and prices at the pump.

9281 2018-06-05 03:40:06 But the first thing he did was allow a pipeline of leaking oil to be allowed on indian land whilst harming and killing some as he promises it will be ok...and now all the water is contaminated and there is a huge leak over the aquafer..way to go.
9282 2018-06-05 03:40:03 Republicans cancelled the #irandeal to raise oil/gas prices.1 million barrels per day of Iranian crude was at stake. U.S. Gasoline prices are up .80 cents from Day 1 of Trump in office. Killing/relaxing EPA rules at home? How can the price go up other than crooked business deals.

9292 2018-06-05 03:38:32 tried to make fried noodles, but I panicked when frying the garlic and broccoli because of the oil and accidentally turning off the gas instead of just lowering it. So I ate cold noodles and half-cooked broc and garlic. :T

9344 2018-06-05 03:29:59 Is this leading to some sort of CBD Oil advertisement?
9345 2018-06-05 03:29:37 I use CBD oil for my anxiety and to sleep better. Been taking it for two months and it works wonders. I’ve partnered with @NaturesUltra so if you like what you see use ALRYJAZZ15 at checkout for 15% plus free 3 day shipping.
9346 2018-06-05 03:29:21 Same! Though to be fair, pretty much all “truffle oil” isn’t actually truffle, I believe it’s a faked approximation of the flavor. I hate “truffled” foods but I had actual
shaved truffle on a dish once and it was totally different and delicious!
9347 2018-06-05 03:29:13 There’s not enough food in the world; not enough water; not enough oil and metals for everyone to have a cell phone, a computer, or a car.  

These are all lies and you don’t have to be a scientist to expose this deception.  Just open your eyes and look around.
9348 2018-06-05 03:29:09 That will continue in next month due to the reduction in the oil production because of the lack of maintenance in all the PDVSA infrastructure. I wish the Russian company begins to demand for the quantity of oil they supposed to receive every moth, it will be a caothic situation
9349 2018-06-05 03:29:08 That’s WAY too much sense! But my recommendation!
9350 2018-06-05 03:28:54 It's actually oil not water.
9351 2018-06-05 03:28:51 Why my side nigga the only one who appreciates my coconut oil!?
9352 2018-06-05 03:28:41 Yes, and to their utter shame this crap govt. refused to force manufacturers to name palm oil in their products.
9353 2018-06-05 03:28:30 And Trump will only take advantage for his own gain. He's a carnival barker, a snake oil salesman. He tells enough people what they want to hear and they're all in. They'll never see (or admit) they've been conned. We need to hammer on the truth.

9377 2018-06-05 03:24:21 @GasBuddyDan why are gas prices going up?  Oil went down and Canadian dollar went up.  What excuse now?
9378 2018-06-05 03:24:07 We just ignoring the way that oil lamp is being held?
9379 2018-06-05 03:23:50 Ooh is this trope in The Poppy War? I just started reading it! I live in Chengdu and I love all the details that make TPW feel so Chinese - the thing about gutter oil in particular made me go damnnnnnn. I have injested quite a bit in my time, I'm sure

9381 2018-06-05 03:23:42 Need to re-up on @aveda exfoliating creme cleanser too. I use that. Then use olive oil & sugar 
9382 2018-06-05 03:23:38 Coconut oil in hair helps
9383 2018-06-05 03:23:38 No one wanted to tell a story so here I am smoking, listening to Pink Matter w/ my sage oil burning... wish me luck I need some rest 
9384 2018-06-05 03:23:24 Depends on your specific needs. I have super dry skin so I moisturize with body butter or coconut oil following showers. I spot treat my acne with tea tree oil. I exfoliate in the shower a couple times a week. I also use Baebody eye gel as a face cream after I shower.
9385 2018-06-05 03:23:17 Ive got a canvas primed and ready to go! Excited to bring out my tackle box full of oil paints tomorrow. #makersgonnamake #oilpainting
9386 2018-06-05 03:23:10 i just exfoliated, shaved, mositurized, and put on glowy body oil. it’s over for you bitches
9387 2018-06-05 03:22:59 Before frying, sprinkle a little salt in your pan which will help keep the oil from splattering.
9388 2018-06-05 03:22:53 Your tax money subsidizes fortune 500 companies, ie oil Company, etc. You have no problem with that? One dime to the poor and they want "free stuff".

No one advocates taking anything from anyone, per your right wing view. Asking companies to be socially responsible makes sense.
9389 2018-06-05 03:22:53 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
9390 2018-06-05 03:22:50 Copped this 10 in 1 shampoo. Shit is shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, mouthwash, lotion, after shave, castor oil, cologne, and chap stick
9391 2018-06-05 03:22:38 Took my basic chicken noodle soup broth(water, bouillon, mirepoix, chicken, herbs) added some soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, fried garlic. Clarified it. Threw my fresh veggies, mushrooms, and some egg noodles in the pot. Smh.

9394 2018-06-05 03:22:02 Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 12 paise and 10 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 85.65 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 73.33, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website.
9395 2018-06-05 03:21:39 I tried to do this whole self-care thing where I do a face mask and exfoliate in a nice warm bath, but now the tub is covered in a layer of coconut oil and I have to clean it so I don’t really see the purpose here
9396 2018-06-05 03:21:37 Ghana and Ivory Coast almost have a combined 75 percent of the world's cocoa production. I'm not too sure about that of Gold though. Oil production in Ghana only began in 2010. And you're welcome.
9397 2018-06-05 03:21:24 Castor oil!
9398 2018-06-05 03:21:24 Yes, @cathmckenna it is time to move on. On from oil to a sustainable efficient green healthy diverse economy.

9405 2018-06-05 03:19:37 The government axed granting any future offshore oil and gas exploration licences without a formal Cabinet paper and with minimal analysis from officials, according to a dump of documents and emails from Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods.
9406 2018-06-05 03:19:28 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
9407 2018-06-05 03:19:24 That is what happens when you attempt to nationalize an oil industry that other countries were invited to develop.
9408 2018-06-05 03:19:18 Yeah I have a lot of cbd products and they’re banned substance free. I have Hemp Infused Cooking Oil, CBD Drops, CBD Lotion and gummies. Helps more than people will know. The cbd infused sports rub is great for after training.

9411 2018-06-05 03:18:45 Hot oil ala mommy ems 
9412 2018-06-05 03:18:41 Because in the areas where oil and natural gas is extracted, the soil is salty and can no longer be used for grazing and therefore becomes....A FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTION!! 

So these people, salt of the earth is good.
9413 2018-06-05 03:18:40 Vogue Italia is the fuckin shit, now that’s a scandalous magazine. They had dead models dressed up as pigeons during the big oil spill, two men kissing, and a drug addict....but all in the name of high fashion. I’m hear for the scandal!
9414 2018-06-05 03:18:40 To paraphrase the great @stephenfry this man displays the evangelical preachy corruption of a snake oil salesman where verbose pseudo intellectual fact free bombast and victim narrative replace robust well grounded ethical arguments.
9415 2018-06-05 03:18:29 She was so silent through the whole Trans Mountain saga. How can she possibly be happy about pumped oil? Must be clapping in glee over turmoil and uncertainty. "Move on" is just stupid....it's not over yet, CM.
9416 2018-06-05 03:18:27 My great grandparents were Alabama hard scrabble farmers that migrated to California during the oil field job explosion - early 1900's. My Granny lived in a tent w/ 5 kids for 2 years. So hot in central California in a long skirt. Strong strong woman, and the sweetest. Victoria.
9417 2018-06-05 03:18:07 Whoops, I accidentally 2nd degree burned myself.

Oil splatter is no joke
9418 2018-06-05 03:18:03 Yes, by exploiting resources, poisoning land and water, and giving absolutely nothing back to Indigenous people not ensuring their safety and access to clean water in the process....all to supply oil to China. Are you out of your mind?
9419 2018-06-05 03:17:43 You’re a joke , we all have seen the videos of Iranian police men hitting a woman for taking her hijab of , we have worlds biggest university PNU and it’s for women , Iranian people are poor they’ve never seen the money of their oil it’s all goes to hezbollah
9420 2018-06-05 03:17:41 I don't know how the PC'S can criticize the NDP about the accounting mistake when they haven't themselves  submitted anything with numbers that people can take account? 

Folks, the PCs are selling a false bill of goods! Do not buy the Snake oil!! You / we will regret it!
9421 2018-06-05 03:17:35 Are they legit medical marijuana “cubes” (if it’s not smoked, what is it? Just the same chemicals in a jelly sort of thing?) or like CBD oil at a stinger dose?
9422 2018-06-05 03:17:34 I don’t understand the whole concept of “incels”. These morons do know they can use their dominant hand, some baby oil and their imaginations to achieve the same outcome, right? (Pun intended.)

9424 2018-06-05 03:17:26 And let us not forget that not all reports are equal. Need I remind you of the report prepared for National/Act on P (meth harm) that has caused so much unnecessary hardship for many. 
Even commonsense dictates that oil exploration must be ceased & efforts made to find other ways
9425 2018-06-05 03:17:23 @jihadwatchRS  what’s your take on the barcalona agreement in 1973 for steady oil to Europe and to bring Muslims in ( 1995 agreement n then 2010 implemented ) ? Apparently 
9426 2018-06-05 03:17:22 Except... Syria is a net IMPORTER of oil.
9427 2018-06-05 03:16:56 To all the pipeline protesters: You should be protesting all the people who are demanding the oil not the pipeline which is being built because of the DEMAND! Go protest the drivers not the pipeline.
9428 2018-06-05 03:16:20 Oh well they will never know, oblivious idiots. There’s this 7 year old with Rheumatoid Arthritis that I’ve coached in youth mma for over a year, well he was in 5 different meds for it. We finally talked his mom into getting 600 Mg CBD Oil from 3rd rock and 2 months into it
9429 2018-06-05 03:15:59 There are lots of people out there pedaling snake oil health remedies that convince people who are unable to assess the accuracy of their knowledge that they know what they are talking about (when they really don’t).

9437 2018-06-05 03:15:06 Hahahahaha but really when I had long hair pa I used to brush it for like 10mins so I think maybe that kinda helped(???) since I don’t use any type of ~hair enhancer~ except shampoo and con. Ay I tried moroccan oil pero it was too difficult to wash out so I stopped.

9439 2018-06-05 03:14:48 In short yr interpretation of 'good' can in fact be translated as selfish. U want oil so you & other wealthy people can continue to live a lifestyle that's causing havoc with the environment. One does not need a scientific report to see the weather extremes due to climate change

9441 2018-06-05 03:14:36 Michelle. You must understand, there is a global agenda being pushed and played to undermine past and current institutions in almost every sector. Here in canada, the oil&gas institutions have been destroyed, next its the steal, timber.

Do not mess with big oil. See "The Formula".
9455 2018-06-05 03:13:02 We don't import crude oil. Our refinery was closed down.
9456 2018-06-05 03:12:56 Oil prices dropped by 150 to 30 dollar. Yet they didn't go back to camel. UAE, Turkey, Jordan has least of Oil economy.
9457 2018-06-05 03:12:53 So the Turkana people should just let their oil to go an go just as it was commissioned by the rich criminals.

9464 2018-06-05 03:12:15 Means 0 - fact is that oil is ruining the environment. Of course there's reasons not to ban it - some excellent ones, but NONE of them are good enough to excuse killing the planet & humanity along with it. I applaud the Govt for having the guts. 
May the selfish die first

9479 2018-06-05 03:10:36 Fuel Price Check
Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 12 paise and 10 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 85.65 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 73.33, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website.
9480 2018-06-05 03:10:24 You know, the Jones Act issue is a fuss.  If they repeal the act it would benefit the importers, we won't see a bit of benefit. Best example? Oil was down over 50% for several years and index prices stayed same. I pay $6 gallon of milk and it's local milk.

9486 2018-06-05 03:09:30 You realize the leader of the GOP is forcing energy companies to buy coal and oil to use for electricity instead of more economical options. You don't have a leg to stand on for energy policy.
9487 2018-06-05 03:09:21 It is a crime to immigrate into the USA without permission.
9488 2018-06-05 03:09:17 Well what do you think? Wouldn't you call still selling licences to search for oil and gas well into the future while also committing to a zero carbon economy hypocritical? Remember the right to search is/implies the right to exploit.
9489 2018-06-05 03:09:16 ban on future exploration for oil and gas Mathew is not the same as an oil and gas ban

9493 2018-06-05 03:08:36 There were plans to canvas VAT to other products like oil and food items. It is things like these that are likely to be the spark because governments everywhere by design, especially those that are struggling have an affinity to tax more instead of looking for solutions.

9499 2018-06-05 03:08:02 I mean, if I refused to back a cake for a Trump supporter and that was cool, what if the grocery wouldn’t sell me groceries because I’m not a Trump supporter?

Maybe I need my oil changed but they don’t like the Hillary sticker on my car.

Where would it end?
9500 2018-06-05 03:07:56 Yes, Trump’s fault. 1. We are exporting too much of our own crude oil. 2. Revoking Iran Deal, putting sanctions on again. Iran is an oil powerhouse. 3. Cozying up to the Saudi’s & Russia. The two nations made a pact to cut back on production, in order to increase prices.

9503 2018-06-05 03:07:17 I had a Nissan and I went to get my free oil change and a guy that drove a GTR (1000,000) needed to get his brakes fixed and said I can’t afford my rent for if I get them fixed

9505 2018-06-05 03:06:53 You can’t even have residency in most Muslim countries. We are good enough to drill for and extract their oil. No way you can live there. But who in the hell would want to anyways?

9509 2018-06-05 03:05:39 $USO watching closely for an entry. Oil trend still bullish.
9510 2018-06-05 03:05:20 I had to wash mine today. I cried a little bit inside over the loss of the oil and residual product that gave my hair volume. ;,(

9516 2018-06-05 03:03:41 Fuel Price Check

Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 12 paise and 10 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 85.65 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 73.33, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website
9517 2018-06-05 03:03:22 Like he said castor oil. Sulfur too if it’s bad bad. You can buy sublime sulfur and add it to the castor oil at night. Make sure you put a Durag on cuz if it gets in your eyes it’s gonna burn lol

9522 2018-06-05 03:03:03 Did anyone else know that Dawn Dish Soap isn’t just for cleaning birds covered in oil? And that the word Dish in Dawn Dish Soap is referring to the dishes that you can clean with it?
9523 2018-06-05 03:02:45 Lol cooks making minimum wage smelling like frying oil, I tell my girl she’s a queen every day but pretty sure I’d be good either way 
9524 2018-06-05 03:02:34 Obama administration claimed that America was in a position to not go above 2% GDP ever again - so get use to it they said. Well, now it’s well above that because of tax cuts, reduced  regulation & oil production increases.!!!!
9525 2018-06-05 03:02:31 It's called Supply and Demand, Brainiac. The economy is roaring which means more demand for oil and gas which makes gas rise in price. Also, world demand is up too. You're not too bright, huh?
9526 2018-06-05 03:02:26 My thoughts exactly NBA Twitter brain cells be frying in canola oil lmfao
9527 2018-06-05 03:02:16 Cost-push inflation, mainly due to oil prices which we cannot control, is always an area of concern. What we can do something about is inflation due to demand getting too far ahead of supply. That’s why we need Build! Build! Build! to spur increases in productive capacity.
9528 2018-06-05 03:02:02 Im gonna come in and order a caesar hoagie with oil and vinegar and balance out the universe.
9529 2018-06-05 03:01:39 I gave Karen her hoodie back and was saying how it might have Car Oil On It and this gurl really thought I was about to say cum!!!!! 
9530 2018-06-05 03:01:23 I don’t know what stings more. My heart, or the fact that I just splattered fuming hot oil on my wrist while cooking. 
9531 2018-06-05 03:01:10 The government of Montenegro has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Jason Ritter in a coutil wig.
9532 2018-06-05 03:01:08 The need for carbon pricing and regulation is antithetical to the prospect of oil being stranded. The only stranding that will occur will be deliberate (like choosing not to build the pipeline). The reasoning is backwards.
9533 2018-06-05 03:01:03 @FinnBalor should bring baby oil to the squared circle and make his opponents slip call it a last man standing match #RAW
9534 2018-06-05 03:00:46 In the oil patch problems occur when someone throws a monkey wrench into a completed well opening.  That is where the saying comes from, it screws everything up, not dissimilar to the Dimocrats

9539 2018-06-05 03:00:09 I sprayed the stems and leaves of my flowers with a mix of soap,  Serrano chili, garlic,  and castor oil..  Now the gopher is just eating the roots and stopping at the stems

Under the deal, tanker trucks bring 30 to 60 thousand barrels of Iraq's oil (daily?) to Iran, which will be then piped to refineries in Kermanshah, Tehran, Shazand and Tabriz

9568 2018-06-05 02:54:20 Yeah it takes a while. If you know where they're coming in, you can corral them so they don't wander all over the house by laying down a layer of peppermint essential oil (diluted in some water) as a perimeter. They don't like to cross it.
9569 2018-06-05 02:54:07 Add two gallons of olive oil and stir vigorously.

9588 2018-06-05 02:51:57 Hmm... I keep going back and forth on this whole Iran issue. With the oil deal between Iran and Iraq it has Ahmadinejad written all over it. The question is how involved is Rouhani, could Ahmadinejad be directly involved, or does  Ahmadinejad have someone w/in Rouhani's circle
9589 2018-06-05 02:51:55 what would happen if i put sweet tea in my oil diffuser
9590 2018-06-05 02:51:50 I've seen most of it at her FB page, but I'll bet she has a web page. Also, I have a book of hers --one of George MacDonald's stories. Her scratchboard technique is out of this world. Every bit as good as her oil paintings.
9591 2018-06-05 02:51:31 Physical activity triggered lvl 8 pain in my left ovary, going down leg. (Felt like kidney stone-level pain. This happens a lot.) Tried to power through. Two hours later I am at my limit. Critical cure vape, Charlotte's Web oil, and CBD/THC topical, pain faded within 10 minutes.
9592 2018-06-05 02:51:20 But the stock piles already there. In addition the type of oil extraction is dirty oil. The amount of waste with the type of drilling is just bad.  So why continue with dirty oil if we know its dirty? Fracking/Tar Sands/Deep ocean.

9602 2018-06-05 02:50:11 We could stop opressing them for wanting to keep their oil to themselves
9603 2018-06-05 02:49:55 Week 2 of drinking 3-liters of water a day and week 3 of using coconut oil as my only body moisturizer.  So far the results are super positive.
9604 2018-06-05 02:49:37 I’m still not sure magnesium oil does anything other than make my leg skin burn, but I bought a whole bottle so I guess I’ll keep using it

9611 2018-06-05 02:48:39 It's not terribly hard. It's basically just drain out old oil and put new in. You'll have to dispose of the old oil yourself though.
9612 2018-06-05 02:48:32 do you think i am recommending any of those foods to people? i am not. if you notice i agreed with you about oil. 

all you are pointing out is that the nutritional transition away from a low fat, high starch diet is associated with markedly worsening ncd rates. well known fact.

9647 2018-06-05 02:44:34 I mostly hear about it used orally or in the context of massage oil, but it also works just fine in an e-cigarette cart. One gotcha, the oil is very fluid and can escape common seals.
9648 2018-06-05 02:44:32 This is just sad and disgusting, we need to clean up our garbage. rather than building a new oil platform why don't they put forth all the effort it would take and go clean up our Oceans for f-sakes!

9650 2018-06-05 02:44:11 Sir Please reduce the #Fuel prices. We, the middle class people are finding it little hard. More than that v being BJP supporters finding hard to hear bad words abt u from Congress supporters. Crude Oil prices are down, so get fuel prices also down. REMEMBER U NEED TO WIN 2019.
9651 2018-06-05 02:44:10 I am deceased. For a white boy to be that shiny thats a lot. But better to be slathered with baby oil than to have inexplicably greasy hair

9654 2018-06-05 02:43:42 to allow them to build pipelines, expand oil sands, to avoid reducing their pollution, use athabasca river water for free, to build giant toxic lakes of tailings they'll never clean up...I could do on. I've been up there.
9655 2018-06-05 02:42:42 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!

9665 2018-06-05 02:41:09 @jiffylube I took my car in to get an oil change & the guy said the person who last changed my oil ruined the bolt by tightening it too tight so they won't be able to change the oil, Boyfriend saw fresh strip marks and was able to take it off first try with the right size socket

9677 2018-06-05 02:39:47 The secret of eating it. Just let a piece drool in the mouth and it goes soft after hitting the right taste buds. In Kerala there are both the soft and hard versions available in bakeries. I guess you should have used a little more Ghee or oil. There are suggestions if you google

9689 2018-06-05 02:38:19 This is what conservative government gets you. There are states with no world class cities, no international ports, no fishing industry,  no oil and gas industry, no major rivers, and yet, #Louisiana has all of the above. Still last. Thanks #GOP

9698 2018-06-05 02:37:06 Medicare and Social Security is socialism. So are subsidies for farmers and oil companies. What don't you like about those things?
9699 2018-06-05 02:37:01 Oil is good for you hair so maybe it's a good thing?
9700 2018-06-05 02:36:59 What not to do on chopped: use truffle oil, serve @SantosCooks a taco that isn’t the best taco he’s ever had, use the ingredient as just a garnish (no no), don’t Serve something too little or too big of a portion yanno just a few I’ve learned  @TheTedAllen

9706 2018-06-05 02:36:33 I’m pretty sure that’s because there is a mandatory age limit to run for certain positions, plus you’ll need a lot of dirty money to secure your spot in office, and also the majority of oil companies backing your campaign and position you choose to hold, but good luck!
9707 2018-06-05 02:36:24 I do know that the top oil companies are American.  What do they lobby the Alberta and Federal government about?
9708 2018-06-05 02:36:13 right, more than doubled all calories from oil from 5% to over 10% so you're talking about hundreds of calories per person per day.
9709 2018-06-05 02:36:02 my updated daily skincare routine

6. moisturizer

9710 2018-06-05 02:35:49 You had 16 months to find out what was true and what was lies. You never fucking bothered to look. To look deeper, to discover that without TPP we’re a third rate former world economic powerhouse. That fracking is awful but coal and tar sands oil are worse.
9711 2018-06-05 02:35:28 If you think about it, asking for paper bags at checkout it okay. Sure, it truly depends on good stewardship, but unlike plastic bags, it is renewable. Plastics come from a finite resource and at some point, it will cause an economic disaster—oil. We’re on borrowed time. 
9712 2018-06-05 02:35:23 Hoy en el noticiero #ElGobiernoDeTodos se resaltó la importancia de promover inversión en los Campos Oil&Gas a través de @PetroamazonasEP.  Les invito a mirar cada semana este espacio, encaminado a difundir la gestión que realiza nuestro Presidente @Lenin Moreno y su Gabinete.
9713 2018-06-05 02:35:23 I’ll be honest, when someone says they voted for Trump, I tend to think of them differently in that how could you put everything aside for the promises of a racist snake oil salesman?
9714 2018-06-05 02:35:07 Coconut oil fixes 99% of my problems

9718 2018-06-05 02:34:25 Understandable. I know the oil pipelines aren't the best. But both oil and coal are much cleaner than they use to be.

Nuclear energy seems pretty clean also, if they can get that in systems instead of oil.

Those wind turbines apparently don't make enough electricity lol
9719 2018-06-05 02:34:12 Where do they sell those lip smacker lip oil things?
9720 2018-06-05 02:34:05 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

9728 2018-06-05 02:33:08 I did and have in the past,  it's just practically frustrating when your product is a highly volatile oil and it becomes trapped in the Ph3PO after precipitation with pentane.  Sonication frees a lot of it, but I still lose some.
9729 2018-06-05 02:33:06 Took my CBD oil and 6 mg of melatonin and for whatever reason I'm still up ‍
9730 2018-06-05 02:33:05 Have none of these people watched Chopped before?? Put down the damn truffle oil.   Good grief.

9736 2018-06-05 02:32:01 Lavender oil smells soooo good
9737 2018-06-05 02:31:51 Put some coconut oil on it, that fixes everything.

9744 2018-06-05 02:31:14 Hooray for jojoba.  i have frankincense essential oil with jojoba as the carrier oil. A few drops gives skin a brightening boost. & I drop a bit of jojoba in with my moisturizing oatmeal/epsom bath concoction. (Nashville tap water is chloriney  which my skin hates. So drying.)

9755 2018-06-05 02:29:55 This is strange--my son's friend told me this afternoon that his mom uses drops of hemp oil on her tongue at night to battle insomnia and it's working.

9757 2018-06-05 02:29:51 Too bad the Supreme Court didn’t see fit to set a precedent regarding discrimination aimed at same sex couples. Can any company refuse service? What if you’re out of oil on a freezing night? Sounds far fetched but this is what they’ve set up for the future. EQUAL RIGHTS!

9760 2018-06-05 02:28:44 I hope you are right about that, but it seems Trump's base has been "losing" for years: jobs, health, education, and they are willing to let Fox, Trump, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh and other snake oil vendors point the finger at Obama, Dems, "Liberal Media" etc.

9762 2018-06-05 02:28:01 Obviously that foreign oil coming in does not meet our environmental standards. Do some research into this perhaps?
9763 2018-06-05 02:27:52 that said, i'm well aware of the necessary reliance of oil until situations with renewables can be rectified. but still, that does not excuse ramping up emissions and exports.

9769 2018-06-05 02:26:52 Maintenance costs of BEVs exorbitant? youre kidding right? Service for the farm diesel recently: fan belts, timing belt, injectors, oil filter, fuel filter, air filter, coolant and hoses, brake pads. Over $2.5k. BEV - they kick the tyres and put on new wiper blades.

9779 2018-06-05 02:24:59 I started a full spectrum pure’total plant’cannabis oil cleanse. 3 days now. Amazing so far. Feel stronger. Have to be very careful with the dose: potent-<weight & food ingestion. 7 days, trial, morning or night first, then both times. Drink lots of fluids. Feel the Heal, active.
9780 2018-06-05 02:24:58 Of course! start at a low dose and work your way up until it starts doing what you need it to do. The oil would be best for that since each drop is 1 mg.

9782 2018-06-05 02:24:16 It's amazing how many men with two first names who work in government, military or oil companies want to be friends with me - and most of them are divorced or widowed! I'm such a lucky gal.....
9783 2018-06-05 02:23:33 lol I’ve learned to just always make sure it’s never dry when it comes to dying it, my hair broke off real bad but I kept it from getting dry. Not too much oil but just enough & not to constantly wash it cause hair makes its own oils if it’s healthy.
9784 2018-06-05 02:23:29 Drive thrus are a conspiracy by oil companies to get you to use more gas. Stay woke my brother.

9787 2018-06-05 02:23:10 Jojoba oil is the best!
9788 2018-06-05 02:23:09 I heard it was because President backed out of Iran deal that they cut their oil production and putting less barrels on market.

9790 2018-06-05 02:22:44 Y’all, I’m about to cry because I thought we had oil at home to fry some french fries but we don’t so now I either have to go get oil or fries and I’m just distraught.
9791 2018-06-05 02:22:40 Blah, Blah, Blah, Kenny's bad - that song is getting old!  Unless I fell asleep and missed it the TMX expansion isn't getting oil to any markets yet; until it does, you've done nothing!
9792 2018-06-05 02:22:30 Between ride hailing, car sharing, biking, and investment in public transportation, we should be removing parking stock every year, and start taxing existing spaces. We don't magically have more oil and more roads, why do we need more cars?

9802 2018-06-05 02:20:36 CBD oil, it’s great for anxiety . It’s the medicinal part of marijuana ... not psychoactive so you don’t get high from it... just calms you down
9803 2018-06-05 02:20:21 Please tell me my mom isn’t the only one who says “if it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t work” because I’ve only heard asian mom’s say it and I know it’s not true . She just did some asian back rub with a special oil to help my allergies and it worked but it hurts 
9804 2018-06-05 02:20:06 This fracking all over the world is insane, are the oil and gas fields really running out. Mm with the current tech of renewable energy, tidal, wind and solar overtaking the fossil fuel energy giants its a wonder why they have to fack.

9811 2018-06-05 02:19:32 So yeah you know #crookedhillary had way more dealings with Russia then these made up back door meetings you imagine Trump had. 1 of the main probs you libs have is thinking that evil witch you hate but were forced to vote for is pure as snow. She’s as clean as motor oil.
9812 2018-06-05 02:19:24 SIR, INCREASE IN OIL PRICES HAS BECOME A NIGHTMARE TO PUBLIC AND THREAT TO BJP IN 2019 ELECTIONS.GOVT HAS TO BRING PETROL AND DIESEL UNDER GST. PEOPLE ARE FINDING DIFFICULT TO GET NOTES FROM ATMS.GOVT MAY ADVISE R B I TO PRINT MORE LOWER DENOMINATION NOTES .MORE ATMS ARE NEEDED..
9813 2018-06-05 02:19:18 The pipeline is now under the control of a federal government that is openly hostile to Alberta and the oil industry.Taxpayer dollars would never have been needed if Trudeau had only done the proper thing and pushed ahead with a perfectly legal, approved pipeline.

Unbelievable,,,SAD
9817 2018-06-05 02:18:48 Do you know what the deal is on electricity interconnectors, or piped gas supply?
Perhaps you know something about the 2 year stockpile of nuclear fuel against the 5 year+ requirement to setup a EURATOM equivalent?
Also, the UK imports most of it's diesel and 32% of oil.
9818 2018-06-05 02:18:47 OOPS I FELL IN LOVE WITH OIL PAINTING AGAIN
9819 2018-06-05 02:18:47 Oil of oregano 
9820 2018-06-05 02:18:35 Vegan Summertime hack: you can make vegan chocolate hard shell with cocoa powder, coconut oil, and a sweetener. It's fucking delicious 
9821 2018-06-05 02:18:08 Rubbing alcohol has lanolin in it which is an oil. Oil isn't necessarily a good conductor and might not help. Grain alcohol of 150 proof or de-natured alcohol from a hardware or paint supply is good or reagent grade isopropyl alcohol which is expensive.
9822 2018-06-05 02:18:04 I wonder if Andy ever got to the oil rig...
9823 2018-06-05 02:17:58 @RaftSurvivaGame me and my boyfriend just started playing raft today. We had no idea we spent 6hours straight until 3 am playing  can't wait for the next updates!! Bigger islands maybe  fish in the ocean, oil rigs, electricity who knows it's endless possibilities

9828 2018-06-05 02:17:26 I went to my cousins party and felt like a paper towel. I left with lipstick and oil stains on my belly & shoulder.  not to mention all the clammy hands that were being dried off on me. 
9829 2018-06-05 02:17:14 Copaiba oil (active constituent: beta-caryophylene) may be worth considering. 

Like CBD, beta-caryophylene is a cannabinoid that binds to CB2 receptors and has a long history of human usage. 

Unlike CBD, copaiba oil is inexpensive and legally uncomplicated.
9830 2018-06-05 02:17:13 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

9833 2018-06-05 02:16:49 Chef Skinner cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with sushi.
9834 2018-06-05 02:16:33 I would never get offended because I know they are just theories

9841 2018-06-05 02:15:20 Did they rush it at times? Sure.
Was it too dark and overkill at times?Sure.
Were there flaws? Sure.
But was it Spring Water compared to the Tar Sands Oil that was 02?

9843 2018-06-05 02:15:09 My grandma is a lil tipsy, and accidentally used wine to saute the mushrooms instead of olive oil. I thought she was kidding and being funny at first until I realised she actually did it on accident... now I'm concerned.
9844 2018-06-05 02:14:54 I thought you called it baby porn cause it involved lots of oil sjshsjsjsjsj I peeped tho
9845 2018-06-05 02:14:35 If you’re against Canadian oil then guess what you’re for....foreign oil. Maybe target the abusive regressive regimes and their blood oil.
9846 2018-06-05 02:14:31 Well, no sh--. The report may also indicate that ending exploration for oil could reduce the likelihood of finding any.
9847 2018-06-05 02:14:30 True, but why are paying more to have someone else refine it and pay markup? That’s not logical. It’s a lazy solution. Oil firms pay dirt cheap royalty rates in Canada. David Black offered to put in a substantial amount of his own money to build a refinery in B.C. then ship it.

9851 2018-06-05 02:14:02 Clear backpacks are made from plastic, which is made from oil, which means we should also use gasoline filled trash cans at all the exits just because #nothingmatters
9852 2018-06-05 02:13:52 literally luv my hair. hot oil treatments, braid outs, leave in conditioner treatments, different hair styles, and doing almost anything with it is so purifying. and just noticing the growth when i flatiron it & see the length. I instantly feel like Beyoncé. 
9853 2018-06-05 02:13:48 Nothing beats Xanax.  Not that I would know personally  The oil is supposed to relax you especially if you have different ailments.
9854 2018-06-05 02:13:47 For an oil lamp to burn, the wick has to be partially immersed in the oil. 
Life is like the wick of the lamp, you have to be in the world and yet remain untouched by it.

9863 2018-06-05 02:12:04 We need to refine our oil. No selling unrefined oil only to buy it back at a higher rate. That should never be allowed to happen.
9864 2018-06-05 02:12:03 Sir, the point is not whether we CAN afford it, the point is whether we SHOULD . In 2014 oil was around $110. Now it's $75. The pump prices are higher NOW.
9865 2018-06-05 02:12:02 Thanks! I’m just having a rough time with oil paint lol I’ve never used it before  it’s the most annoying substance on the planet

9881 2018-06-05 02:10:15 Odd, isn’t it?  We used to have lots of domestic oil and gas for domestic consumption but apparently profits are better if it’s sold overseas. Who makes our energy policy now?

9890 2018-06-05 02:09:32 When it’s someone you don’t like your advice when they can’t pay their bills is “be better.” When someone you do like can’t afford something you blame the expense (insurance in this case). You don’t tell him to be better. Think about it.

9917 2018-06-05 02:05:57 Ah yes, let's not forget the making of money building bombs and killing people.  Same for oil exploration and the entire fossil fuel industry.
9918 2018-06-05 02:05:56 Based on your tweet, he should either be able to afford his expensive insurance, or if he can’t, he should simply leave his job and get a better one so he can afford the insurance. Right? Should be really easy right?
9919 2018-06-05 02:05:48 Yea I hear that I use one for anxiety it sucks but cbd oil is better then pills.
9920 2018-06-05 02:05:44 It’s an artificial, genetically modified, chemically extracted oil that is high in pro-inflammatory onega 6s. There are worse things for you, sure, but canola is still not something that should be consumed on a regular basis.
9921 2018-06-05 02:05:43 Tonight was a short but full stream of oil tycoonery at its finest! Thanks to everyone for coming out; I had a blast with Turmoil as a budding oil man.

President. Trump
During the first two years of the Barry Setoro administration, he is said to have given Petro Bros a Venezuelan oil company 1 billion dollars. 
Each year -2 billion total 
Can we get our money back
God Bless.  Ty. Give our love to your wife

9933 2018-06-05 02:04:19 I hope you feel better sis! Prayers will be sent and get some sleep. Make sure you eat lots of healthy veggies and broiled food to get nutrition. Try also eucalyptus oil because it helps with bronchitis. Be safe!
9934 2018-06-05 02:04:15 @POTUS So happy to have Donald Trump as my president! I am wondering however, why gas prices are so high with oil at $64 a barrel????
9935 2018-06-05 02:03:56 Hate to say it but unless your tweeting using a stone slab, you are part of the problem.  For me, Canada energy lets many live a good life and care for the environment in a lawful way vs the 60 plus million bbl per day of corrupt blood oil ...
9936 2018-06-05 02:03:54 This is the first time I’ve heard oil and gas resources (which I’m sure you & your family consume) called a “gimmick”!
9937 2018-06-05 02:03:43 He’s complaining about his insurance going to shit, not shoveling it. Ffs. You ever been around animals? There’s lots of yucky jobs. It’s your responsibility as an owner to either do it, or hire it out.
9938 2018-06-05 02:03:06 Snake Oil metaphors will abound!
9939 2018-06-05 02:02:34 My father in law's is a truck driver currently carrying steel an is already seeing a huge impact an it only just started. Trump doesn't know how to play fair and Canada needs to treat him the way he understands. Tax stuff that matters to America, oil and hydro
9940 2018-06-05 02:02:33 Plastic bags are not recyclable & they are produced from non-renewable sources like oil & petrochemicals.

9942 2018-06-05 02:02:23 My great grandfather, a man named Clyde Carroll, started the union at Standard Oil in El Paso in the early 1900’s. He was a card carrying socialist, and a firm believer in workers rights. I think that’s pretty fucking cool.
9943 2018-06-05 02:02:17 Fuel Price Check

Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 12 paise and 10 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 85.65 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 73.33, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website.
9944 2018-06-05 02:02:15 At $80 oil our unemployment rate is extremely high and economy not even at pre-recession levels and now deep in debt. Yes thankful this nightmare will end soon...
9945 2018-06-05 02:02:11 All these people could be working in the Renewables Energy Sector. But noooooooo, we rather sign checks to Texas instead. Oil is not the only way. California’s diversified economy is now the 6th largest globally.
9946 2018-06-05 02:02:06 I have a big bottle at my desk I put it on every hour or so. Every night I mix coconut oil and African shea butter with some vitamin E and rub it all over my body. I mean I don’t know if that helped too. I know vitamin E is helpful for heeling wounds.

9966 2018-06-05 01:59:33 Anything to do with the oil crisis?
9967 2018-06-05 01:59:27 I absolutely LOVE using peppermint oil.. it gives your scalp a tingly sensation after massaging it in.. I call that the growth sensation 
9968 2018-06-05 01:59:21 And argan oil at night after cleansing. Also good for hands and feet. It’s not that expensive and you only need a few drops so a small bottle lasts forever. I should mention my skin is dry. Not sure how putting straight up oil on your face would work for different skin types.

9970 2018-06-05 01:59:11 It is more important to reduce oil prices immediately otherwise people who support BJP will desert party in 2019.

9974 2018-06-05 01:58:26 I had that pegged at snake oil right out of the gate. They go to such great lengths in the commercial to avoid specifics.
9975 2018-06-05 01:58:12 On step forward, 3 steps backward. The best message we can all send is by reducing our dependence on oil. Every 2 or more Vehicle households should at least own one EV/Hybrid; there are no more excuses with over 37 makes/models.

9978 2018-06-05 01:57:55 Well he's a decent part of it.  The price of oil is sky high, that's part of it.  Anything he does in the middle east affects gas prices.
9979 2018-06-05 01:57:45 I have decided to...

Bake chocolate chunk cookies. Coconut oil substituted for butter.

They will be delicious.
9980 2018-06-05 01:57:25 So why are gas prices so dammed high. With this much oil the price of gas should be $1.00 a gallon.
9981 2018-06-05 01:57:20 #roadtripchat Clean oil filter and correct tire pressure.  Oh and stay away from the expensive gas in California lol lol
9982 2018-06-05 01:57:03 Whenever I see the Dawn  commercial where they clean oil off a duck, I think to myself it was someone's job to baptize a duckling in motor oil to make an ad for soap.

9992 2018-06-05 01:55:15 Ever since we went off the gold standard the US dollar has been the currency of trade in the world. If China wants to buy oil for Saudi Arabia they have to do it with American dollars.

10014 2018-06-05 01:53:03 My bottle of whiskey I just bought costs more than a barrel of oil. I can literally buy 55 GALLONS of oil cheaper than a bottle of alcohol. Let that set in.
