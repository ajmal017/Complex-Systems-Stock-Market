2 2018-07-04 23:52:34 It also seems like day trading in stocks. where you look at trends for stock movements and you are placing bets or puts on weather the stock will rise or fall within the session or week. those transactions require quite a bit of action or capital. is the same true for exchange?

8 2018-07-04 23:44:16 So a report in a Norwegian finance news-output states this has been the worst half year for stocks since 2010, still manages around 6-7% return overall. Pretty happy about that tbh.

13 2018-07-04 23:38:33 I’ve become so nervous about what Trump’s Twitter fits are doing to the stock market that I’ve been moving savings out of funds (that you can only sell at the end of the day) to individual stocks, including $CGC Canopy Growth Corp, a Canadian cannabis company. 
14 2018-07-04 23:36:29 Corruption Alert...

Every 3pm  Wilbur Ross wakes up from his 2 hour nap  in his White House Office makes a few calls and see which stocks to short knowing Trump will be tweeting out a new tariff in the coming days.

Then jail.
17 2018-07-04 23:34:37 Yeah, cos the largest stocks of fish consumed on the UK (like cod and haddock) are in Danish and Norwegian waters. 80% of British fisheries catches get sold to the EU, as the shellfish common in our waters aren't popular in British shops.

19 2018-07-04 23:29:01 Being nice. You probably think I screwed during the financial crisis. GS did not screw you. There was a complaint made about naked shorting of stocks during the financial crisis and GS was mentioned in it. The truth and now you know..

41 2018-07-04 23:26:40 Indeed. Some silver stocks too
42 2018-07-04 23:26:38 I'm an adviser and broker for a large financial services company and I mostly deal with small investors with total AUA under $1MM and I'd get fired for shorting any company's stocks.  I can't even buy puts.
43 2018-07-04 23:24:19 Hi Rahul, thanks for reaching out to us. We work in conjunction with eBay Australia, however we do not have the ability for the stock level indicators on eBay as they are an independent marketplace. to reflect ‘real-time’ stocks (as we can with our own website).
44 2018-07-04 23:21:11 It takes 2 damn days for my money to go from my bank to my stocks, how stupid?! I wanna buy the stocks now! Not 2 days later when the share prices are $5 and up 
45 2018-07-04 23:19:42 Indeed. Perception is very powerful and can impact things like stocks far more than truth. Switch hasn’t really fallen off despite no heavy hitters yet this year. That should show how healthy the demand is. Everything is going to spike again when we get to November.
46 2018-07-04 23:17:45 Anyone in stocks and bonds not doesn't appreciate what's coming. Cryptos are hugely risky. Gold and silver are the proper investments IMO, the real thing.

48 2018-07-04 23:16:05 How many stocks do you have? Most Americans do not benefit from the stock market being up. Jobs that don’t pay a living wage aren’t really beneficial. Tax cuts that benefit only the wealthy, meanwhile most get $1-50 a paycheck more. And gas prices, food prices etc are up.
49 2018-07-04 23:14:46 Too bad they couldn't add on a few days in the stocks being pelted with rotten fruit.

56 2018-07-04 23:04:56 I was a finance major myself and have quite a substantial portfolio and I do not even know much about half the stocks I own.

59 2018-07-04 23:02:10 That's not even factually true! 

Where do you think the US get their stocks from?
60 2018-07-04 23:00:46 Right. The more fear mongering she & the rest of the NRA do, the more $ they make. Someone is always coming to take away everyone's guns. So sales go through the roof. Ammo too. Now even bump stocks, after Vegas made everyone aware.
61 2018-07-04 23:00:28 Shit I still have Bayer stocks;)
62 2018-07-04 22:56:53 21% off is an amazing offer we have on at the moment, while stocks last, you might not get this chance again

64 2018-07-04 22:56:23 You are correct that consumers pay. Investors too if a companies stocks get hit. What I disagree with is that the economic imperative is the only one, so suffering the discomfort of a trade battle to win a war is acceptable to me.
65 2018-07-04 22:54:49 That's another perk. You can trade in and out of T12 stocks on Interactive Surepoint Securities.

87 2018-07-04 22:19:25 I believe I asked my question first.   Why, when the majority is in support  (82%) of banning bump stocks and ... it cant be done.  Why won't the NRA support such a measure?

111 2018-07-04 21:48:31 Personally, in a thin market I expected the powers that be to bid this market up a lot to resume dumping stocks at a higher price.  They kinda failed at that mark.  I’ll be shorting ES at 25 and if it drops below 16 I’ll be shorting harder
112 2018-07-04 21:48:30 we investing in stocks this year my dudes
113 2018-07-04 21:46:50 Since the EU began trawling; the stocks were thrashed and we then bagan to pay European prices for fishery stock living off our own coast. 

EU boats trawled so heavily; they even dragged  up WW2 aircraft off of south coast.
114 2018-07-04 21:46:33 Because of overfishing. Stocks had collapsed.

119 2018-07-04 21:41:58 Texas charges 8.25% and also makes the thrift shops charge it on used stuff that was already taxed once.  But is there a 1% or .0001% tax on stocks?  Oh, no.

Il faut donc tempérer l’optimisme du calcul savant, qui conclut à juste titre à l’impossibilité de « faire sauter la planète », par un nouveau calcul qui démontrerait que les stocks d’armes nucléaires ne peuvent tuer toute l’espèce ni rendre la planète totalement inhabitable.

123 2018-07-04 21:38:21 remember, good stocks don't always go straight up, but I do expect that $UHLN, based on their two new mega-acquisitions, will bounce, continue moving up to penny, then multiple pennies - never return to sub-penny.  What a fantastic gift these >.002s
124 2018-07-04 21:36:02 Fishermen never accept that fish stocks have collapsed due to overfishing. The nationality is irrelevant. More magic Brexit nonsense.
125 2018-07-04 21:34:37 Of course he did. Their stocks also shot up on the promise of putting even more people in prison. Remember infrastructure week? Prison camps, that’s all he’s gonna build. The jobs we’ll get are prison or border guards.
126 2018-07-04 21:33:21 Let's not forget that $brk /Warren benefited massively from inability to short bank stocks and other steps that the federal government took. Also no need to post margin on massive short Put spx position. That said you and I could have participated by owning his stock
127 2018-07-04 21:33:07 As a former analyst I have to wonder how many shorts and spreads and various forms of profiteering on stocks and commodities the Trump family has enjoyed over the last year. Think of Hillary Clinton's commodities hot streak on steroids

129 2018-07-04 21:28:48 What you want to know... 
buy stocks in products you use/believe in.
Diversify your portfolio

Don’t get too high/Don’t get to low
Ease into it.

131 2018-07-04 21:21:01 dude enough with this book & stop commenting on my shit. no one wants to sit behind a computer all day & pretend like trading stocks is a full time job. goodbye.
132 2018-07-04 21:19:12 We need to manage our stocks to the same level the Icelandic people do. Then use the Royal Navy to sink any foreign boats caught poaching.
133 2018-07-04 21:18:53 Stock comment. You have an equal chance to have said stocks you have to be willing to not have now for the chance to have later. If you dont have stocks thats by choice. I started my portfolio at 25 after my first son was born. I got taxes back and I put $500 toward stocks
134 2018-07-04 21:18:24 Could you maybe do something about 600 people getting shot in 10 minutes and ban bump stocks?  You don't have to ask Crazy Uncle Wayne - just do it.
135 2018-07-04 21:15:00 Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross admits he sold two more stocks short, betting they would lose value when he knew foreign policy would hurt them.
That brings to five the number of stocks Ross sold in deals that may be illegal under federal insider trading laws. 2/2
136 2018-07-04 21:12:45 Thanks Mike, you are correct. I like our foreign affairs and I like the economy, not just the tax cuts but the low unemployment and the higher stocks. Its sad that I have to worry what such an RT could lead to.  Hope you are enjoying an old fashioned southeastern Fourth.
137 2018-07-04 21:11:20 Love you but I have a lot of 401k  in oil stocks.  Wish u could knock off the oil producing talk
138 2018-07-04 21:09:02 I discuss my stocks & performance since thats my platform. Ultimately, its about comfort.  I dont have the restrictions @buildingbread does
139 2018-07-04 21:05:23 Kro stocks. Prove all the moaners wrong mate
140 2018-07-04 21:04:34 Don't you dare tell an Air Force veteran what he should do on the 4 of July. Nobody under 21. No bump stocks. Stringent checks
141 2018-07-04 21:02:53 Infinite respect for the work #CAMH does. Is this the best idea to partner with the #HudsonsBay that stocks #IvankaTrump shoes, clothes and accessories despite the work the #Trump admin is doing to traumatize youth, children, families? I say no #Baycott #Complicit #GrabYourWallet

143 2018-07-04 21:01:48 Science question: how many years will a cell line survive if frozen in liquid nitrogen? I found some that were thirty years old while making an inventory of our stocks
144 2018-07-04 21:00:15 Summer always slow . Telling ya this fall alot of stocks going to heat up man 
145 2018-07-04 20:59:37 It’s extremely concerning. Russia is the only nation with he stocks that has any interest in using them against the U.K., although from all reports they don’t seem like a couple to be targeted in any way.
146 2018-07-04 20:58:25 We need to change the laws and rules for Congress. Abolish corporate lobbying. End corporate and private financial endorsements. Demand accountability. Disclosure of financial status, income, stocks, liquid assets, wealth creation by all Congress and Senate members. Even Potus.
147 2018-07-04 20:55:25 But what about my oil and gas stocks, think of us shareholders trying to make our easy money.
148 2018-07-04 20:54:16 Final tally on the day I went through 499 shells. I think I have the stocks dialed in after my weight loss. The guns are pointing where I look. I got a lot of good practice in today.  #sportingClays on the #4thofJuly
149 2018-07-04 20:49:55 It's funny how the moment Nintendo's stock drops all of a sudden everyone's an expert on stocks and how Nintendo's gonna have a tough time turning this one around. While I do wish they showed more at E3 they already said they have more announcements. I'm sure it'll get better.
150 2018-07-04 20:46:27 No Corporations 2 avoid meeting ACA requirements used #GOPTaxCuts  2 buyback stocks not increase wages, health or retirement benefits.  Employees are getting screwed.

154 2018-07-04 20:43:41 If you can't handle me at my oblivious afreet available while stocks last, you don't deserve me at my elaphocentaur getting a kick out of it.
155 2018-07-04 20:43:28 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
156 2018-07-04 20:43:13 What’s your stance on gun control? Do you believe that banning bump stocks will help?

158 2018-07-04 20:38:59 Markets fluctuate, but overall more stocks are doing better than worse - dont tunnel vision to DOW
159 2018-07-04 20:38:37 The vast majority of stocks are owned by rich people. I said equal stake i mean equal stake.
160 2018-07-04 20:38:29 I watched a Large White laying eggs on my stocks and
Rocket (herb)  and sweet peas yesterday. Is that usual?
161 2018-07-04 20:37:34 @TMobile @TMobileHelp @JohnLegere what is TMobile going to do about the employees who falsely thought 2 Black men were going to rob the store and called the Cops on them? A long time customer and investor in your stocks is asking.
162 2018-07-04 20:37:10 Bring back stocks and chain gangs!
163 2018-07-04 20:36:51 It's had enough guessing mine and I can even see what my individual stocks have done  ;-)
164 2018-07-04 20:36:50 Well than why are bump stocks and 100 round clips still legal?
165 2018-07-04 20:34:55 bro your stocks are going up just because you are linked with him.
166 2018-07-04 20:34:32 You have much more control on the selling side. But they are both much better than buying and holding the entire underlying. It's in the 2-3% range order in cash risk. I mean, you invest 100 in stocks, and for the same call you may invest 2-3 only.
That IS RISK CONTROL.
167 2018-07-04 20:34:18 My advice: avoid politics and focus on anything else. 

My (late) father put all his $ in oil stocks, & thought they were going to skyrocket, no matter how much we argued. So, he lost 60% of his wealth.

Sometimes a person has a blind spot.
168 2018-07-04 20:34:07 America Bailed Out the Banks by Increasing the National Debt after 2008 to Save Wall Street From Collapsing. Wall Street Rewards Themselves With Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Stock Buybacks #Buybacks #Trump #Republicans #TaxCuts #Stocks #WallStreet #Banks
169 2018-07-04 20:31:52 Hey look another company that’s spending its tax cuts on wages.... wait what?! Their buying back stocks!?!? I thought they were supposed to put that back into the economy. Boy they must be alone in this strategy, surely.
170 2018-07-04 20:31:34 You can get stocks for .01. They aren't for rich people they are for people willing to forego having something else in return for a chance at extra later on. My granny worked for Wal-Mart, in store, for 32 years. She had stock options, just like most publicly traded
171 2018-07-04 20:30:35 USA! USA!
172 2018-07-04 20:29:42 Yeah #BOO has been hard work lately  (like most Stocks  !!) but I'm pretty sure patience will pay off for us.
173 2018-07-04 20:27:25 J'ai fait des stocks pour 20 ans. Pas bête, la bête...
174 2018-07-04 20:27:21 And I thought he was gunning for the SENATE!
175 2018-07-04 20:25:37 If I had my wish I'd put her & IDS in the stocks so you, me the world and his wife could show these beggars just what we think of them
176 2018-07-04 20:25:30 LOL!  Forgot about that.
His great taste in stocks makes up for that snafu.
177 2018-07-04 20:25:30 I just downloaded the betway app. 
Guess who’s gonna be a stocks broker?! 
That’s right, me Nigga!
178 2018-07-04 20:24:57 Yeah we don’t like our stocks high or our people having jobs. We should all be equally poor instead
179 2018-07-04 20:24:55 The real game is the forensic audit,I disposed all my oando stocks pending the release of this bomb.
180 2018-07-04 20:23:24 can people actually buy stocks from Nintendo?
181 2018-07-04 20:23:16 I have stocks of both 
182 2018-07-04 20:22:38 Enjoying the evening in the garden with the scent of night scented stocks and tagetes 
183 2018-07-04 20:22:11 Coming from the "Gordon Gecko" of solar stocks.
184 2018-07-04 20:21:41 With the US taking the day off for Independent Day holiday, US futures and European bourses posted modest gains even as Chinese stocks resumed selling, dragging Asian markets lower even as the Yuan's remarkable comeback continued.
185 2018-07-04 20:21:35 Not a red herring at all (unless you mean our fishing stocks are covered in the blood from the grubby paws of the EU ).
186 2018-07-04 20:21:12 MONEY IS FAKE TOO. CRYPTO CURRENCY IS ALSO FAKE AS FUCK, WE HAVE THAT SHIT LIFE. 
WHO EVER IS BEHIND IT HAS ALL YOU MONEY, NOT YOU.
STOCKS ARE FAKE AS FUCK TO.
187 2018-07-04 20:19:07 It’s crazy and SO American
188 2018-07-04 20:18:36 That sounds really bad and would actually encourage camping since it would be easier to time someone out. Especially since it’s looking to be 3 stocks.
189 2018-07-04 20:15:38 Trump and Sessions are making out like thieves they are also, prisons stocks
190 2018-07-04 20:15:24 Protect our kids. Do your job. Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to purchase guns?
191 2018-07-04 20:13:27 I was wondering if someone could go along with a load of water pistols. Or a water canon, and take out all the idiots who go along to watch too...
192 2018-07-04 20:12:21 If anyone is interested in stocks and investing money this early of an age hmu.. The earlier you start the better off you are. The more minds we have the better we can progress. Think about your future and where you’re trying to be. Serious inquiries only please.
193 2018-07-04 20:12:09 Like going from 10% unemployment to 6% is easier than going from 6% to 5% than 5% to 3.8%. Same with stocks they dropped from a high than went back up to a high and slightly climbed past what they inc were at. Stocks under trump are jumping up in a short time.
194 2018-07-04 20:11:46 Really? How about universal background checks, adding domestic violence as a reason for not getting a gun, closing the gun show loop hole. Ban bump stocks. Ban military-type semi-automatic rifles. This has been all over the news, Twitter, etc. So why are you asking ME?!
195 2018-07-04 20:11:19 Yeah!!!!  P.s.  ban bump stocks, not nofx
196 2018-07-04 20:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
197 2018-07-04 20:09:45 Trop hâte de voir la JE arriver j'espère que les stocks des exposants que je suis seront dévalisés 
198 2018-07-04 20:09:10 The say i see if is under Obama he unemployment dropped, stocks values went up but this didn't really happen due to him. Just simply the markets at work when the stocks drop they will rise again. Trump is getting everything to super highs or lows that is really hard to do.

200 2018-07-04 20:05:29 Hopefully Nigel, by that date we'll see you either in the stocks or in a cell. Perhaps you should stand for parliament again, there are still a few opportunities to get your nose in the expenses trough when your EU trough closes.
201 2018-07-04 20:04:22 Im expecting payment tomorrow, I pray I won't get tempted by the weekend coming up cos I have plans to buy stocks been saying this for sometime 
202 2018-07-04 19:58:53 En soit ça te gâche juste une stock, et vu comment c'est dur a réaliser, et que dans mêlée c'est du 4 stocks, c'est pas si horrible que ça (Sauf sur ta last stock en phase finale de l'Evo, la ça peu être gênant )
203 2018-07-04 19:56:34 How could you make any trades today. All the stocks were halted today. I dont understand, did every stock got T12 or what.
204 2018-07-04 19:56:27 What’s a good pack with nature stocks???
205 2018-07-04 19:55:47 Share dealing isn't as easy as it seems at first... the main problem or the main enemies to making money are the Body of directors. Any how let's see if something good will happen with AST
206 2018-07-04 19:52:13 Where does the law stand on a group of people, say...farmers? standing in the field next door and shooting them out the sky, with a bowser on stand by?

209 2018-07-04 19:49:56 Actually your right .. emphasis on watch list... that's what everyone invested are doing with their #AST shares.

Come on @colhutch can you please, please do something to get the SP higher.

You will make us all very happy and there will be a few cases of bushmills for you  
210 2018-07-04 19:48:33 This shows that these fraudulent investors don't know jack about gaming and this industry. If I had more money I would totally buy some Nintendo stocks since the stock price is going to shoot all the way back up in the fall.
211 2018-07-04 19:45:58 If you want to learn options in stocks I will pay to be your studnt ... u have the mind for it ... do the AI and pot sector options  and fin tech
212 2018-07-04 19:45:28 My avg in AST is 1.85 so I'm about 50% down on it.

Of my portfolio, it's about 10% at the moment
213 2018-07-04 19:45:12 NANI?! But the stocks! An armchair analyst told me that the Switch was doomed!!
214 2018-07-04 19:44:15 But it keeps us employed and if you are true capitalist you will share in their income by buying stocks
215 2018-07-04 19:43:06 Benny, is that 50% of your portfolio or 50% of ast share you have?
216 2018-07-04 19:42:29 That's why their stocks were always at 0 before they bought Star Wars.

218 2018-07-04 19:42:23 I agree no point selling now
Although averaging down has got me out a hole before with another share I just feel with #AST it has to go big or it's not gonna move much... I'm just gonna bunker down and ride this one out!

220 2018-07-04 19:41:24 listen i don’t mean to sound like one of those “she looks so different without makeup” kinda gals, bc that is the point of makeup. but when u look like a completely different person without it theres a problem 
221 2018-07-04 19:36:51 Sure, if  you’re a rich man or a profiteer. Prison stocks, gun sales going up up up.
222 2018-07-04 19:36:27 People love using stocks for confirmation bias when most investors know very little about gaming at all. They only know that mobile, imicrotransactions, and big casual AAA bait equals quicker money. If it were up to them, Nintendo would basically be EA.
223 2018-07-04 19:35:46 One of the wildest lessons I’ve learned about money is that income and wealth are two completely different things. Income is what you got coming in, wealth is stocks bonds land insurance policies trust accounts foundations etc
224 2018-07-04 19:35:11 Picking up more $kwh.un $6.43 $dgs $6.85 two healthy dividend stocks that im long on can’t say no to a serious pay cheque ever month.  Started into $kbg added $tci #potstocks on watch. $grat added .10 thru finally done games  $ipa starting o load and $ate and $loto .055. 
225 2018-07-04 19:34:16 Future's killed the price, not the banks. It's the big investment hitters that are able to play god with crypto. However, unlike the traditional stocks and shares market, there is NO COMPANY to go bust.
226 2018-07-04 19:33:02 Lmao stocks, really?  No. That's rich people, not employees.  Each employee should have an equal stake and an equal vote, because democracy is more fair than dictatorship.

Profit is nothing more than surplus labor value anyway, and workers deserve to keep it/vote how to use it.
227 2018-07-04 19:33:01 Guess I should have bought some Oscar Meyer stocks yesterday.
228 2018-07-04 19:33:00 It's both labor intensive to start & upkeep, as well as a certain level of tech savvy. Not qualities I typically associate with "old school" shop owners. The new era get it & embrace it, they treat cards more like stocks whose values are volatile than showpieces.

234 2018-07-04 19:28:18 Most public business are employee owned. Because of stocks. You get what you put in. Private businesses make agreements to have people work for them and sign a contract based on that.

What you're saying is that the treasury, who has nothing but debt, tells the Federal Reserve
235 2018-07-04 19:27:05 Theft is theft - in these cases particularly cruel and evil thefts.  Restitution should only serve to ameliorate the sentence this swine receives. To defraud an unfortunate widow and, separately, an orphan!  Bring back the stocks! 
236 2018-07-04 19:26:01 were you live trading stocks?
237 2018-07-04 19:22:01 Well the stocks matter to me because I actually have money invested into Nintendo.
238 2018-07-04 19:18:59 It is fun watching anyone react to stocks.
239 2018-07-04 19:16:28 I want to create a life where I make real money. Money to buy real estate, stocks & invest. Money to buy a million dollar home & take 5 figure vacations. Go where I want, buy what I want & don’t need to sell flat tummy tea or cashback apps to pay my bills at the end of the month.

241 2018-07-04 19:15:26 Shriram Transport Fin stocks looks very attractive due to severe fall in past 1 week and especially on Wednesday. Effect on financials due to impact of provisions on subsidiary's NCD issue seems overblown. Stock can sharply bounce back.
242 2018-07-04 19:15:21 I still don't get why people are freaking out over stocks.
243 2018-07-04 19:15:16 Driving in the UK is also Illegal but everyone does it. I think it could be a decent play on stocks but think you will see plenty of companies pop up trying to jump on the bandwagon. Might be worth a trade, but risky

258 2018-07-04 18:55:38 Although $15-20k is a “big” amount of money, what if he traded his plan? What if his plan for the trade was to make $40k (he has done in the past) do you think he would of achieved such amount by risking $2000? Especially in high volatile stocks? Everything is relative IMO

275 2018-07-04 18:45:17 @JoeSquawk Hi Joe.  I've been watching your coverage on Squawk for a very long time.  I trade stocks for a living and care deeply about unbias content. Unfortunately, w the addition of very bias and liberal anchors (Other than yourself) I have moved away to watch Fox Business.
276 2018-07-04 18:45:09 Seriously.. im really tired of buyers who keep asking but never make payment after i send the payment details.. its not hard to inform me if u r not interested to buy already..
277 2018-07-04 18:43:08 I force myself to watch @CNBC for my stocks. The past 2 weeks they had three libs 9:00-10:00.

281 2018-07-04 18:37:27 Stock price is actually widely considered the single most important indicator of a company's finacnial viability.

291 2018-07-04 18:29:00 Stock prices on spec stocks dont have to make sense, either direction. I crunch the numbers and come out with what I believe is fundamental value and then buy when the stock price is lower than that number, same for selling.

298 2018-07-04 18:19:25 More of a reason for them to blink first. If you invest in a company, do you want it to be successful and thrive or do you want it to fail?

388 2018-07-04 17:08:36 Bank stocks have had a great run surging nearly 55% between November 8, 2016, & January 30, 2018. Dreams of higher interest rates, deregulation and tax cuts boosted bank profits.

Word passed through the ranks that the EVs we'd abandoned days ago were recovered the underground before the red hats discovered them. The underground is using them to raid the red hats' bourbon stocks.

May this shorten the war.

445 2018-07-04 16:25:40 Im sixty four & invest in stocks. I can honestly admit I buy when #Republican's have control & sell to make money under the #Democrats.  So my advice is buy at bargain basement prices for two more years if you can hold out that long & expect an upturn after that.
446 2018-07-04 16:25:36 If you are somehow saying that the economy or stocks haven’t improved under Trump you are lying to yourself and should get your eyes checked out

448 2018-07-04 16:24:23 Nice and the funny part is that you can say the same for trump. And that his economy and stocks have boomed compared to Obama’s. And I doubt you actually saw the graph and realized it was relatively not increasing or decreasing before falling twice tremendously

मैं किसी भी पार्टी का समथर्क नही हूँ

462 2018-07-04 16:12:18 I bring bad news from the western front. Supply lines have been cut. Stocks of kombucha, Adderall, and quinoa are waning.

463 2018-07-04 16:11:14 In the meantime corporate profits have exploded , cash is being repatriated,  regulations are coming down , and forward pe ratios are below 16 ...just bc stocks haven't gone up for 7 months doesnt signal an issue does it ?

465 2018-07-04 16:10:20 He's just smiling because he saw the stocks go up over a rumour they didn't even launch. I also wouldn't put it past Mendes to use Cancelo as leverage to force Juve to play along with this and getting Ronaldo a raise in the process. Still, it's nice to dream

476 2018-07-04 16:04:33 Difficult learning curves are the best! I did a year on a demo account - learnt some useful things but nothing can prepare you for dealing with your actual money!

I'm sitting tight with it, roughly 50% down but I can take that hit for a few more months.
477 2018-07-04 16:04:29 Did anyone's stocks rise at E3?
478 2018-07-04 16:04:09 Also, the economy and stocks dipped once in the entire year rather than twice before the election concluded. If you’re saying that somehow America was more financially stable than it is now then you are practically lying to yourself.

484 2018-07-04 16:00:45 Not "kismat ka mara". 
People tend to sell stocks that are up and keep stocks that are down. 
MF Houses (momentum-based ones) buy stocks that are up. So the ones that are up keep advancing.
This'll happen until those advancing stocks do a Vakrangee one day.

492 2018-07-04 15:55:51 My father fought in Vietnam so that wealthy Liberals would never have to have awkward social encounters. This is the kind of hell Orwell warned us about. Still, those private prison stocks are doing great so at least they have that.
493 2018-07-04 15:55:32 Worldwide trade wars are keeping yield prices in check . Investors sell stocks and buy "Safe haven" UST , this won't last long come October if QT isn't stopped .
494 2018-07-04 15:55:11 I guess part of the thing with stocks is that they need to know this stuff. If Nintendo doesn't show anything, they assume they don't have anythinf, bc stocks rising means investors are taking the dive. Falling stocks means they're afraid to invest. If my understanding is correct
495 2018-07-04 15:55:01 Low float stocks before penny stocks, that’s too volatile for people to learn first.
496 2018-07-04 15:53:06 It's ironic because if you read sources from the 18th century plenty of people in Britain called out colonialism for what it was. And nobody who didn't have stocks in the East India thought it was anything but a gang of corrupt thieves. But in the end the rich wrote the history.

1. history will repeat it self 
2. All other variables (forex, Inflation, Global perception of risk, inter country movement of money etc) will remain the same as earlier
517 2018-07-04 15:35:23 Need to invest in more stocks
518 2018-07-04 15:34:27 Reply 1- Yes but some argue it's more relevant for developed nations.When we look at Market Cap to GDP ratio we are measuring how stocks are valued against the growth of consumption in the economy in a broad sense in the current situation.
519 2018-07-04 15:33:49 Yes it is.
520 2018-07-04 15:32:34 Yeah no, that's not because of the Donald. "The economy and stocks have been better now." That's not a sentence. Nor do you provide any citations to back up your claims. Also, do you know what a trend is? See what the trend has been the last eight or so years?
521 2018-07-04 15:31:44 Risk and tax is involved everywhere whether it's betting, crypto, stocks, trading, investing etc.

651 2018-07-04 13:59:41 Acorns has managed funds which they hold the assets like stocks or bonds. You are buying shares of their fund not the actual stocks. So when they change their fund your investments change.

663 2018-07-04 13:52:36 Surely profits are theft.. no?

If corp tax was 100% they would pay staff more & give bonuses, pay off debt, invest more or lower prices.  

Many benefits from no profit model.

Also gets rid of the cooked book model for shareholder returns as stocks are just gambling anyway.

666 2018-07-04 13:50:55 On vacation, quickly catching up on $TSLA news ... a good reminder that even CEOs who know their operations don’t usually predict market reactions well. Especially true if stock has super high expectations built-in. I largely ignore the short term moves of stocks.#CalmInvestor
667 2018-07-04 13:50:51 There has to be a rationale for asset allocation &  for the funds & stocks chosen for investment.
Logic & reasoning has to be applied in selection of stocks & funds.
Unless the underlying assumptions & fundamentals change shuffling of portfolio is counterproductive.
668 2018-07-04 13:50:07 Does he bring his own stocks or do you have to supply them? Asking for a friend.
669 2018-07-04 13:49:39 I choked so hard against Over in game 3, the thought "I could be up 2-1" completely wrecked me. I no longer get nervous against players who are worse than/as good as I am but when it comes to better players I still need to calm down between stocks more
670 2018-07-04 13:49:14 No, even you use all the technical tools, you can not find the margin of safety of the stocks. Technical analysis is always the aid tool for operation. It is nothing without the business analysis in long term.

681 2018-07-04 13:35:13 If there's nothing much that @SenateMajLdr can do as a legislator - then he needs to step down immediately.  Congress and the Senate can protect U.S. citizens by firming up background checks, outlawing bump stocks, increasing funding for mental health issues etc.

727 2018-07-04 12:47:01 Equities hate 1. Trade wars; 2. Rising Interest rates and 3. Higher Oil prices. We have all three right now. But equities love strong earnings growth and that's what continues to support US stocks despite messy headlines
728 2018-07-04 12:46:03 Protect your stock investments:

1 - Don't sell at the first dip, stocks are bought for the long-term
2 - Don't follow the herd, do your own research
3 - Understand what the company do and how it makes money
4 - Don't check your account every 5 minutes!

743 2018-07-04 12:38:26 1/ Depends on how you invest in stocks. Best way to do it for 99% of the people is buying a low cost index fund (Vanguard f.e) which averages 8% p.a. For most people it’s impossible to beat the market so this way you just can buy the market.

748 2018-07-04 12:33:09 I agree in principle. However it really comes down to access. You can start investing in stocks with any amount, in real eatate you need a lot more $$ and credit. If you live in a place like nyc the prices of property are so high it becomes impossible for the avg  person.
749 2018-07-04 12:29:31 My two cents:  For me, Focus investing or concentrated investing is a function of

Competence
Confidence
Conviction 
It does not really matter if you are small or big investor; WIDE diversification where you cannot even recollect which stocks you own, is inviting trouble!!

767 2018-07-04 12:06:09 My Dearest Katy,

Our assault on the KFC went well. Their gravy stocks running low, many Red Hats peed themselves. Spirits are high as we plot our final push to the occupied Walmart. We hope to take the shopping center by dawn. Please send kale.

Yours,

768 2018-07-04 12:05:08 This is probably the last thing the company expected. Notice trades are very low... could be the markets are now waiting to see what happens now with this very interesting situation that we are in now  
769 2018-07-04 12:05:08 Or worse. Speculating in stocks by themselves.
770 2018-07-04 12:04:53 What should you think about long term investment or positional investment in this time? Which level is ideal for 50 % of the total capital in long-term 3 to 5 yr? Which stocks will be the best?
771 2018-07-04 12:04:49 Can’t say it’s any better in Australia, but it’s a little concerning for Korean and Japanese football coaching stocks that their federations are reportedly looking to Felipão and Klinnsman respectively over their own nationals.

777 2018-07-04 11:59:07 Thanks Borg. Have just jotted your name down under the category 'AIM punters who don't understand stocks and shares'.
778 2018-07-04 11:58:08 I know mate. I stopped placing phone trades when they started charging silly money like nearly £50 a trade. I know it wont matter 2 much if they multi bag but I cant even see the trades on my platform for Nex stocks so its like being blindfolded as well as having 2 talk 2 someone
779 2018-07-04 11:57:58 @realDonaldTrump It's revolting how the entire Trump family is making money off of the American people, while alienating our country from our allies and making laughing stocks of us when we travel overseas on vacation.  Time to see Melania's visa papers, or time to pack up and go

794 2018-07-04 11:44:38 President Obama started with 10% unemployment, stocks at 6,000, auto industry failing and a depression beginning to 5% unemployment, stocks at 19,000, saved auto industry and 76 months of job growth.  Definitely a success!  Those are facts.  Try Google.
795 2018-07-04 11:43:12 Avec plaisir ! Insiste un peu pour qu'ils voient en réserve. A la femme on peut pas trop renseigner sur les produits soldés car le réassort est fait en masse (donc aucune mise à jour des stocks) mais à l'homme je pense qu'ils peuvent peut-être prendre le temps de le faire !
796 2018-07-04 11:42:33 US americans own many German stocks. So they earn the money, not 'the Germans'. German consumers face higher prices and not more salary since 15 years now. The exports are so high, because t´he Euro is so low. This also means German consumers have to pay high import prices.

800 2018-07-04 11:39:42 So True. If Trump is for something-you better believe he has stocks in it. His wallet is all that he really cares about.
801 2018-07-04 11:39:39 After buying in low also stocks are falling..... I don't know how to catch...
802 2018-07-04 11:37:54 Ooft, I hit my local comic shop less than 3 hours after opening time on #NCBD and SUBMERGED #1 was already sold out! And my shop stocks well on everything! Clearly @definitelyvita, @lisa_sterle and co have a big hit on their hands with this one!

805 2018-07-04 11:35:42 Real estate is the perfect way to "park" cash outside of the banking system, receive recurring rental income AND always have a place to live in. 

Much better than stocks, yields a considerably higher investment return and consumes a considerably small amount of time.
806 2018-07-04 11:34:42 I think most weak hands have already exited in this small n micro cap carnage... The rise will definitely be bigger n better once the dust fully settles...i am assuming that most stocks will consolidate for a while now before the rally resumes in a big way :)

817 2018-07-04 11:27:44 Investors should be careful of these new financial tech companies offering an easier way to invest in stocks. Acorns, Motif, Stash all are good for only one thing - low starting investment - BUT you don't own the assets outright.

847 2018-07-04 11:04:55 It’s amazing to me that convincing investors to buy stocks by misleading them and providing inaccurate info is securities fraud, a felony. But according to SCOTUS, compelling CPCs to disclose the fact that they’re not licensed professionals is an undue burden on free speech.

886 2018-07-04 10:27:11 High volume could be created by lot of little traders turning stock over or a big holder selling. Impossible to tell. If one of the big holders dumped it in a major rush though the stock would be down more than 7% on one day. On Nasdaq you can get big stocks cut in half.
887 2018-07-04 10:26:43 Although, also we’ll start accepting that securities aren’t inherently to be avoided, but the interesting thing is not just tokenising stocks and shares, rather it’ll be a case of legitimising systems which by some mechanism explicitly exist to generate revenue for tokenholders.

1256 2018-07-04 04:46:57 I love gifts too but damn I’m only screaming like that over property, stocks, and bonds.... 
1257 2018-07-04 04:46:41 Is it time for torches and pitchforks yet? Drive the monsters from the castle on the hill? I suppose those rudimentary weapons are no match do semi-automatics with bump stocks, though.

1259 2018-07-04 04:43:46 There is no silver bullet or magic formula to arrive at the perfect strategy. In my view, your strategy should be based on your investment objectives, temperament, competence and circumstances.

 Personally, no. of stocks in my portfolio has always been in single digits.
1260 2018-07-04 04:43:43 We do not think, it would be fair to disclose stocks for those who work at EQ. These are 10-20 SME stocks covering various industries.

1268 2018-07-04 04:35:28 Like the Bush Tax Cuts? The funny thing about tax cuts is they usually benefit the 1%....like Trump, his family, and his administration....and they usually use those to buy back stocks in their companies.
1269 2018-07-04 04:34:06 Lynch also said " Owning stocks is like having children - don't get involved with more than you can handle." 
The point: Do not diversify for the sake of diversification. A poorly constructed "diversified" portfolio is equally risky if the constituents behave similarly.

1274 2018-07-04 04:31:14 There’s a growing body of academic research/opinion going against index funds: share ownership becomes too concentrated to be productive, and the largest funds allocate perpetually more money to a small basket of stocks.
1275 2018-07-04 04:30:17 If your stocks aren’t leveraged then you’re throwing away money. Someone that knows stocks would be able to grow their net worth so much quicker than someone that knows real estate

1291 2018-07-04 04:16:55 You forgot the /s for sarcasm. The tariffs are killing our companies and American consumers. Stocks are falling. Increasing prices are eating up the meager tax cut crumbs left for the middle class. And the base is blind.

The conviction is to hold and not get scared by the price movements.

The confidence is to add more even if there is a blood bath on Dalal Street and the stocks are falling down like a sword.

1380 2018-07-04 03:06:47 in most cases you shld make sure the price earning (PE) ratio is sensible, which for retail is around 15. the only exception to this is tech stocks where theres no earnings haha
1381 2018-07-04 03:05:18 Everyone holding on to #stocks brokers/operators upset, telling all to sell, sell! July 2018 going to be worst! Should I fall in this trap & save myself
1382 2018-07-04 03:04:58 Disagree in terms of returns when compared to stocks (steady consistent performers - compounders). Can't create wealth with real estate.
1383 2018-07-04 03:03:37 Was reviewing the performance of 3 infrastructure mutual funds that have beaten the index and was interesting to note that none of their performance was due to infrastructure stocks - One was a real estate fund, second a commodity fund and the third a consumer discretionary fund

1387 2018-07-04 02:56:43 In all honesty I am not a subscriber but if you sift through his previous uncooked alerts, he's called a few of these on stocks and days or weeks later the information comes to fruition. I'm heavily invested with UKOG but with Ben's tweets I wouldn't palm them off lightly.

1390 2018-07-04 02:54:29 Stocks are down for the year, gas prices are up, steel prices are up, mortgage interest rates are up, inflation is rising, Trump tax cuts are only serving the 1%, and the deficit is rising rapidly. 

Do us all a favor "Don't Try To Fix Anything Else" you'll only screw it up.
1391 2018-07-04 02:53:50 Because they are buying stocks now  that will go up in 100 years
1392 2018-07-04 02:53:26 Yes our stocks are being hit right now, but do you honestly think these other Countries really want to be in a trade Ware with the US? Everyone wants our money, it will all work out.
1393 2018-07-04 02:53:06 Quote from Warren Buffett “read 500 pages. Every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it” #investing #stocks #buffettology #cdnpoli #abpoli #KnowledgeGrows
1394 2018-07-04 02:51:17 Just looking at stocks going up makes it obvious
1395 2018-07-04 02:50:07 Real estate is the perfect way to "park" cash outside of the banking system, receive recurring rental income AND always have a place to live in. 

Much better than stocks, yields a considerably higher investment return and consumes a considerably small amount of time.
1396 2018-07-04 02:49:10 As of now, risk of 20-DMA halt at 10,750 remains high for Nifty while IT, Pharma stocks show signs of fresh breakout, says @_anujsinghal in his pre-opening market chat
1397 2018-07-04 02:47:11 As of 10:40 a.m., PSEi 7,227.29 down 40.05 points or 0.55 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
1398 2018-07-04 02:46:57 The press is propaganda. Just think how easy it is for a super rich entity to buy stocks in a media company. Russia owns our media
1399 2018-07-04 02:46:21 My point is, just because you have it. Doesn’t mean you have to use it. I’ve been budgeting for a little over 2 years. Have money in stocks. Have money in the bank. I can pay off the 2018 can I just got. BUT JUTS CAUSE I GOT IT DONT MEAN I GOTTA SPEND IT LIKE THAT.
1400 2018-07-04 02:44:11 No one takes money out of my pocket or anyone else's.  Domestic equities, emerging markets stocks, high yield  and investment grade bonds, real estate investment trusts, and commodity investments have served me very well. All this plus much lower cost of living in red states
1401 2018-07-04 02:42:42 Oh and by the way do you have a 401(k), own any stocks? If you do then you are probably one of the owners of that 90% of the wealth....  

Stop listening to the divisive nonsense of your puppeteers, open your mind wake up and become part of the solution.
1402 2018-07-04 02:36:53 Think we need a new system,this one most certainly doesn't serve the ppl! They seem more worried about their jobs an friends stocks. I'd like to vote for who leads our nation not a bunch of salesmen for the rich picking them for us.

1405 2018-07-04 02:34:27 By propping the Mutual funds and LIC EPFO, govt is already managing the stock market. Even on worse days, the stocks are holding up decently.
Such manipulative practices will only create a mirrage & more scams and mega losses.

1498 2018-07-04 01:06:58 My initial understanding of equities came from when I was a kid. I raised farm animals on our family farm that I sold at the 4-H fair, which I eventually turned into blue-chip stocks that, with my Dad’s help, traded into enough money to cover my tuition and accommodations.
1499 2018-07-04 01:05:34 Trump did not walk into a great economy. Yes Obama did not have it easy. Bush didn't leave the country to him well. But Trump has lowered unemployment, stocks have risen, and were in an economic high
1500 2018-07-04 01:04:38 I’ve worked retail for years and know how vendors work. I’m assuming this vendor is Cafe-Press .They contact stores to buy their products, store orders them, vendor or clerk stocks them. The stores may buy 100 T-shirts sight unseen. Complaints work!
1501 2018-07-04 01:03:28 Ehhh that’s blue chip stocks. I wanna tackle the ones that’s aren’t advised all the time but make you fast money. I’ve been learning from Tim Sykes and Tim grittani on watching the tickers and candlesticks for low float or penny stocks. It’s just hella exciting.
1502 2018-07-04 01:02:51 Investing in stocks is just as bad as donating to me piggy lol
1503 2018-07-04 01:02:41 I have a totally different view about this project , been monitoring its trades at stocks exchange , it’s like a few individuals playing with the price , it’s not healthy & stable ,  there is no adoption at all. It’s like fake numbers even on telegram channel!

1506 2018-07-04 00:58:38 $KMI Kinder Morgan has great long term potential with the increasing demand / price of oil. My personal target price is around $24.50. Balance sheet getting in order as well as a variety of new investments on their behalf. Look for growth. #Stocks #Energy #WTI #Crude #Oil #KMI

1512 2018-07-04 00:44:40 Yes, battery potential isn't baked into the vanadium price. Many punters dismiss V stocks as another green energy play, but nothing could be further from the truth. VRBs have yet to have their day in the sun (heh), and when our "@elonmusk moment arrives, watch out.
1513 2018-07-04 00:43:09 Good. Urge Congress to ban bump stocks and assault weapon no. Better background checks too !
1514 2018-07-04 00:41:09 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1515 2018-07-04 00:40:35 Mannnn... PLEASE trade @Aye_itslaylay to Phoenix. I feel like She would KILLLLLL it there. Coach Stocks put her in for maybe 4 treks up the court just now and pulled her out. Smh ... let the girl get some reps. #wnba
1516 2018-07-04 00:38:56 The crash is coming....next quarter is going to be a freaking disaster.  Cash out those stocks now, they'll be worthless in 6 months.
1517 2018-07-04 00:37:36 Ohhhh! The MEX BOL: IND - S&P/BMV IPC

(the BMV IPC measures performance of largest/most liquid stocks on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores.)  The peso is at 19.50 for 1 US dollar.  What is going on here...
1518 2018-07-04 00:34:44 @SenateMajLd BREAKING:  Mitch McConnell says that there isn't much that the Federal Government can to to help reduce School Shootings.

Strict background checks

Increase age limit to purchase all guns/ammo
VOTE OUT McConnell

1525 2018-07-04 00:24:58 @SenateMajLdr you stupid sob!  You could ban assault rifles. Bump stocks. Improve background checks. Mental health.  Your one sorry pos. You should be locked up for stupidity. You traitor. #ImpeachTrump
1526 2018-07-04 00:21:19 I have been following the topic of short selling for years. Most employees no very little about put options trading and nothing about short selling stocks. So how and when did these relationships start with a known short seller? I like Canada and  Vegas better to start with.
1527 2018-07-04 00:20:10 Great to hear! Good for you! Just saving wild Cobia stocks, one award winning open ocean farmed #Cobia at a time! & Looks delicious!

1530 2018-07-04 00:14:11 I would love to see you trade higher liquidity stocks. Same idea as you are doing just be able to get in and out when you want. Might have to use a smaller time frame chart....
1531 2018-07-04 00:14:04 US stocks fell on Tuesday, led by chunky losses in technology heavyweights, as concerns over trade policy kept investors on edge. Markets closed early in a shortened trading session ahead of the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, with volumes some 20% below average.

1536 2018-07-04 00:04:04 Son’s email from summer camp in the woods focused on the effect on Amazon’s purchase of PillPack on the other pharmacy stocks. I think he will end up in finance.
1537 2018-07-04 00:02:24 Asian stocks set to follow the US lower after China's Micron ban; PBOC tells Bloomberg the yuan won't be a trade weapon; and ex-Malaysia PM Najib arrested, expected to be charged inside the hour in 1MDB probe, all today on @BloombergTV

1539 2018-07-04 00:02:17 Tangina. Concern na concern sa stocks? Mabuti sana kung nagtatanong ka sa amin kung ano mabenta at paubos na. Papagalitan mo kami sa hindi esaktong quantity, e tangina, ang gulo naman ng gusto mo!
