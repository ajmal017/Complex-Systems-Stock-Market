64 2018-02-05 21:41:46 7- Lo que sucedió luego es una historia super interesante. Los commodities agrícolas empezaron a comportarse más parecido a un activo financiero. Los impactos en otros mercados como el accionario empezaron a pegar más.
65 2018-02-05 21:40:54 6- Los principales estudios hasta 2004 marcaban que los retornos de los commodities no se correlacionaban con acciones o bonos por lo que eran el candidato ideal para diversificar cartera.

74 2018-02-05 21:26:02 Unlike Friday, today’s sharp drop was not driven by any macro event or economic data point. A program trading imbalance may be the culprit evidenced by no similar moves in the dollar or economically-sensitive commodities like copper or gold (up less than half of 1 percent).

84 2018-02-05 21:04:45 > The October '87 crash was a 22% selloff.
> Today was a ~4.5% selloff.
> We're not in a recession.

This does not show signs of a fear-based selloff.

91 2018-02-05 20:52:59 the difference is banks, financial institutions and even countries are turning on crypto commodities. It's rather uncertain. A real crypto currency wont truly be accepted until it is backed and regulated by major countries and institutions.

136 2018-02-05 18:46:03 Oil Prices neared their lowest in a month as rising U.S. output and a weaker physical market added to the pressure from a widespread decline across equities and commodities.
137 2018-02-05 18:42:30 Global markets are correcting hard, right from bonds, equity, crypto to commodities. Looks like time to buy all the way to the bottom
138 2018-02-05 18:41:40 Eat PBJ KIDS will enjoy.  Used to get commodities with pbj
139 2018-02-05 18:40:34 We are going to see a rush of capital away from risky equities -- and bubbles like bitcoin -- to less risk-prone bonds.

In terms of commodities, it will likely push gold up as the dollar weakens, but contrariwise push it down as inflation kicks in. Expect volatility.
140 2018-02-05 18:39:29 Investing. I'm still holding tech & commodities, latter holding up. Hold HVU short term to mitigate disaster. Think long term. Don't panic.

142 2018-02-05 18:27:39 AC Twitter having a convo about grad school working hours w/o acknowledging that, worse than the hours alone, the real issue is that time has been and appears to be continuing to shift from labor spent on learning versus labor spent on producing commodities and self-branding.

180 2018-02-05 15:39:06 The standpoint is they actually had a rainy day fund after years of pigeon holing themselves with a single commodities based economy of sorts! Granted it isn’t their one and only income source but it does make up a large part of their GDP.

203 2018-02-05 14:31:31 You also don’t account for under which particular conditions of labor the commodities were produced. You cannot explain why an exchange can take place on the basis of two particular commodities without retreating into assumptions beyond the scope of the question.
204 2018-02-05 14:22:42 The equation of the two commodities is a social act that cannot take place without both a willing buyer and seller. The equation as value is saying “I agree that this commodity is of equal value to the other commodity” which is the basis for exchange.

209 2018-02-05 14:13:50 We are not talking about the physical act of moving goods (not a commodity) between the hands of a buyer and seller we are talking about the mental act by which that exchange can come about. Namely, the equation of the commodities that allows them to be exchanged.

220 2018-02-05 13:49:17 What is the role of money? To be exchanged for commodities. How are commodities given a value? By judging how much socially necessary labor time is embodied in each. Money is the universal expression of value as socially necessary labor time.
221 2018-02-05 13:42:22 it is fair to protect consumers from volatility and complicated issues that the government itself hasn’t figured out. understand your point and respect it.This is not saying you can’t buy.

224 2018-02-05 13:34:27 Farm animals are treated very poorly. What do you think happens to male calves not required for dairy industry. Have you ever heard a cow searching for her babies that have been taken away for slaughter. To call animals livestock shows they are no more than commodities
225 2018-02-05 13:29:19 I also explained that it can do so because it is the expression of socially necessary labor time and thus allows all commodities to be equated on the basis of their values expressed in terms of a quantity of money.
226 2018-02-05 13:27:00 You just presented a quote out of context without any explanation as to how it proves your point nor disproves mine. I already stated that it functions as universal equivalent for all commodities.
227 2018-02-05 13:26:23 I believe commodities are poised for a run giving coming geopolitical instability. Hard Assets are always about ROI and equity returns. But when the market in stocks is peaking and Bonds are like this: pile cash because it will be long shortly

229 2018-02-05 13:19:20 I would look at commodities and Hard Assets. Short on Commodities and long term hard assets for clients.

231 2018-02-05 13:16:24 It is so because it allows all commodities to be equated to it as the expression of how much socially necessary labor time (abstract labor or labor in general) is embodied in it. This is the basis by which all commodities are equated.
232 2018-02-05 13:05:11 @allstarcharts I think after some consolidation you could see this theme resume.  Reflation is preventing commodities from going down but they’re still lagging sectors (ie energy, base metals).  I think they go up with everything else but tech, financials & industrials still lead

301 2018-02-05 07:18:21 Settled in Bitcoin != Priced in Bitcoin

You won't see anything priced in Bitcoin, because it is volatile, and the volatility is never going away.

Furthermore, pricing commodities in crypto is not a pre-req for being a reserve currency.
