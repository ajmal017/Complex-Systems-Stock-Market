8 2018-05-23 23:57:45 @1silent11 Released a new age of crypto.
9 2018-05-23 23:57:37 It's like playing a video game w/o knowing the buttons, It's you against everyone else in crypto and you are just mashing buttons until you learn Candlestick patterns, T/A, indicators like RSI & MACD, etc. I encourage you to take control of your future in crypto.
10 2018-05-23 23:57:17 Taken a while off. You guys realize that most of the twitter #crypto experts don't know shit, right? I mean, don't ignore all the missed calls and theories.

15 2018-05-23 23:56:14 Just became the bitcoin guy at the office and got invited out to drink beer and explain crypto currency to my co-workers. I’m very content with this.
16 2018-05-23 23:56:01 Clearly not crypto, just you.
17 2018-05-23 23:55:57 The blockchain has so many endless possibilities. There are competing currencies & you can have tangible ones backed by a crypto if it makes you feel better.
