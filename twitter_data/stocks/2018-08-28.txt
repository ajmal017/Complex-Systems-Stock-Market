I didn't think you'd answer-
the 2nd part about her taking over(Coaching duties) for Amber Stocks
But the 1st question deserves an answer-No?
16 2018-08-28 23:50:55 You realize his money is in stocks, not actually getting paid $80 billion dollars right. And that’s why Capitalism is a competitive market, if a company pays you poorly. You can get a better job or find another who does! An basic economics class can tell you this.
17 2018-08-28 23:50:50 Sorry I offended. Yes not "proven" assertions but based on what I've seen "vast majority" (I'd guestimate 90% of daily trillions traded in all forms of global stocks, currency & derivatives) aren't primary capital formation, primary default swaps, or price discovery

58 2018-08-28 23:39:40 Today is the day all the shit TSXV stocks file quarters. Must be some sort of SEDAR directive:

Dear Sir/Madam,

Your company has been designated "very shit" by our evaluation committee. Please file your financials on Aug 28th, along with all the other shit stocks.

Yours, SEDAR
59 2018-08-28 23:39:22 People always ask how I, the real Warren Buffett, made so much money on the stock market. It’s simple: I chose the stocks with the coolest sounding ticker symbol. And also insider trading.
60 2018-08-28 23:37:19 Just add xrp to stocks app and display stocks app on ur home screen
61 2018-08-28 23:35:41 Love it really hope make the other channel dedicated to stocks !
62 2018-08-28 23:34:46 That is good. Now the Nasdaq is only one index. Everyone knows that, right? Tech stocks mean a lot, but little of whats in the tech world is made in North America. So once again, good but its only one index.
63 2018-08-28 23:33:33 I KEEP ASKING YOU TO TEACH MEEEE I only have the stocks from my job

66 2018-08-28 23:31:58 There’s no denying it President Trump has done a tremendous job with our country if you look at numbers. Stocks, Unemployment, Comsumer Confidence, Trade, Departing from Bad Deals, Lower Taxes. I wish everyone would lay off him for a minute. @realDonaldTrump
67 2018-08-28 23:31:41 Rolling a damn blunt isn't a sexy skill. Let me see you trade some stocks

69 2018-08-28 23:31:22 LRT is an extremely gracious penalty. I would include some transfer of income earned while committing assault on the reg and also a period of time in the stocks
70 2018-08-28 23:30:32 They are publicly traded. They have stocks symbols. I'm so sick of hearing that they are private!
71 2018-08-28 23:30:22 So I am about to upset the penny stock teaching industry with my prices y’all better hope your subscribers don’t check out my website or channel otherwise it’s a wrap because I also teach trading blue chip stocks and forex which I started with before you guys probably traded
72 2018-08-28 23:30:08 No but he's probably invested in coat hangar stocks.
73 2018-08-28 23:29:23 “Practically” a millionaire ;) I did see when I looked it up he doesn’t own stocks etc... Delaware being a tax haven I’m wondering if he doesn’t have some secret businesses lying around. 
74 2018-08-28 23:28:34 Wow but at least you made profit
75 2018-08-28 23:28:33 He's actually killing it. Just launched a pot business and pot stocks are doing really well...imagine he is too
76 2018-08-28 23:28:23 Had to get the economy up to par, It is still in demise but knowing it would take a business man to get the stocks roaring and money back in the country who better to elect than DT. No other alternative really....
77 2018-08-28 23:28:22 I was here yesterday too. It’s bad cause super limited stocks per session. Yesterday’s line wasn’t that bad. But today, SUPER LONG. Thinking of not going anymore :s
78 2018-08-28 23:27:44 He's brought jobs to this country! Americans stocks are rising! He was able to bring vets remains home to their loved ones! He's draining the deep swamp! He loves the military! He loves the USA! People are going back to work instead of living off welfare! He's not kissing a$$!
79 2018-08-28 23:27:13 You don’t say? Guerra getting hit hard again and the Brewers getting hammered by a team under .500.....amazing
80 2018-08-28 23:27:01 He is king of penny stocks not bitcoin. 
81 2018-08-28 23:26:45 This means they will run the price up faster?
82 2018-08-28 23:26:36 Bump stocks are banned in most states, and sorry but the Vegas firearms were very illegal. That’s why the media stopped covering it after the initial happening. It didn’t fit the narrative.  Those videos had 600-700 rounds a minute. Much faster than a bump stock will get you.
83 2018-08-28 23:26:33 Wow, I have endured some pretty obscure tangents on @MarketFoolery from @TMFChrisHill and Bill Barker, but they reached all-time levels during “Coffee Drones & Stock Splits” when they started talking about robot dogs on wheels bringing coffee and whiskey. #EpicDiversion #Stocks?

86 2018-08-28 23:24:32 And yet, Trump was right.
Keep underestimating him. The economy is doing great, GDP 4%, stocks at record highs.
POTUS’s popularity is going up. You might wanna think twice before you mock him.
87 2018-08-28 23:24:29 I can’t grasp it fully but, can you guys hear at the very end, one of them pricks says: “What a fucking muppet.”, or something very close to that, I think...

91 2018-08-28 23:22:00 You're right but I still analyze and recommend  Once you move to options it's hard to go back to penny stocks...
92 2018-08-28 23:20:51 US stocks are up; thumbs up!
93 2018-08-28 23:20:41 get that app that was always on youtube ads, trading 212 or whatever it was, you can do stocks and shit with fake money before doing it with your real cash
94 2018-08-28 23:20:21 Manufacturers are using their gift to buy back stocks!
95 2018-08-28 23:19:47 I didn’t realize you trade penny stocks?
96 2018-08-28 23:19:29 Think about it: what if #MSFT, #AAPL or any major tech stocks, decided to create a new stock ticker ("fork") because AAPL was too slow to buy and sell, and the commission for AAPL was ridiculously expensive? On top of that, just trading AAPL requires heavy power usage. #Bitcoin

106 2018-08-28 23:11:56 Stocks are plenty volatile if you play the right ones. But if you can find consistency in crypto then all the more power to ya. Everyone has their own niche. It’s all about mastering that niche.
107 2018-08-28 23:11:34 Again why would they put up a mall. They are an entertainment company. SM is a public company who manages a variety of businesses. Its a public company. You never know, people you are pissed at already owns stocks 
108 2018-08-28 23:10:02 Underpinned by tech stocks like Amazon, who you continually complain about
109 2018-08-28 23:09:59 I doubt he’s taking about price movement because the trends still track the underlying stocks. Finding out when the ETFs rebalance would help I suppose ! Could you elaborate a bit Jason ? @WolfOfWeedST
110 2018-08-28 23:09:16 It’s also funny when people with no TA skills start trading and get crushed, because they thought they can be good traders in a matter of weeks. As if this doesn’t need the proverbial 10,000 hours of experience.. start with forex, bonds, stocks, do good and then do crypto.
111 2018-08-28 23:07:45 My portfolio will probably waste away. In addition, one stocks of the my portfolio have dropped last night aftermarket because of the result.

116 2018-08-28 22:59:41 Maybe, but your guess is probably better than mine.
That's the deal with stocks. You buy them cheap, wait for the price to go up and then sell them. 
If the price doesn't  go up, don't buy them.
117 2018-08-28 22:59:37 Seriously, this might explode your silly MAGA hat, but I know immigrants (including myself), who are able to express themselves more eloquently than you. 

You attempt to criticize public policies, but you're barely literate. What can you possibly know about stocks or history.
118 2018-08-28 22:58:00 great minds think alike. Right on, in the mean time. loading up on USA and Canadian blockchain stocks, charts haven't broke out yet!!!! GL
119 2018-08-28 22:57:48 I watched a documentary about Peter Blake who hasn’t laid out or drew through observation in years... He must have stocks and shares in Chartpak Blenders... he was transfer rubbing A1 canvases... 
120 2018-08-28 22:57:48 Btw, it's Dow Jones chart (which someone referred to as "30 stocks" lololol)

Not arguing, just bull market might be peaking. Dow/gold ratio is like 35/1 or something ridiculous. Lots of overvaluation.

131 2018-08-28 22:52:12 Ok, so now its scrutiny instead of impeachment.  How about no scrutiny and a free pass.  Who cares about this.  Trump is working hard to fix America.  My stocks rule and paycheck is high.  I don't care if he screws porn stars or animals.  Keep up the good work.
132 2018-08-28 22:49:57 Because I hold shitty stocks 
133 2018-08-28 22:49:41 Great ER from $TRLY so I expect if tomorrow confirm $CRON good movement up . $ZUO some recovery after today selloff before ER . And maybe some pullback in $ROKU because of the news about $AMZN. The other stocks in my portfolio will be good (cont) $YEXT $PVTL $TWLO $TNDM $PSTG
134 2018-08-28 22:48:55 Fight for the "high risk" dollar. Right now pot stocks are the "safer" bet, lol!
135 2018-08-28 22:47:05 By his standards it’s been poor. His stocks are dropping. Gone from an un-tradable player to very trade-able and might not even get a 1st rounder anymore. Super talented but is lazy by AFL standards.
136 2018-08-28 22:47:04 Liberals always claim credit after their guy leaves office. Consumer spending and confidence are up, stocks are performing better, leading economic indicators are up, growth is up, unemployment is down.
137 2018-08-28 22:45:59 @kendovision the end is near. the mlfb just converted 50M shares of prefer stocks to common stocks. check out their 8-K report. also, they don't have the $ to do their 10-Q.
138 2018-08-28 22:45:49 Watched the broadcast yesterday,when you briefly brought back old co-host TYLER MATHISON! Shoulda kept him all along! Missed the dude!
He made the broadcast funny! And,watching you tonight as well as you

139 2018-08-28 22:45:38 Buying marijuana stocks is like smoking weed, you get a little high first then crash hard. After everything, you kinda low on money.
140 2018-08-28 22:45:21 Question: tho I haven't read your proposal, I'm all for it. how do you prevent loopholes like wives, children and uncle vinny holding stocks on your behalf?
141 2018-08-28 22:45:21 Over next 30yrs:

The odds that stocks < bonds, OR

Small/value < large/growth

...is infinitesimally small, and Vanguard’s Target Date Retirement Fund for 2045 has 10% bonds and 0% small/value

That’s 200 bps to 300 bps in hidden costs/missed out on expected returns right there!
142 2018-08-28 22:41:17 I like you, but I have to tell you: You have incorrect settings for #Ichimoku. You are using settings for stocks, while for #crypto, which being traded 24/7, settings suppose to be 20 60 120 30. That's why price moves without any respect to the cloud you have.
143 2018-08-28 22:39:59 funny my stocks are dropping...

146 2018-08-28 22:36:27 And Paul Tudor Jones came out recently saying he is kinda flat but is waiting for an explosion in stocks and yields in Q3/Q4. I'll take this guy's advice over almost anyone's.

163 2018-08-28 22:26:32 ... respectively two and five different funds that can invest in stocks, bonds, other equities and even real estate, but whose membership are restricted to being part of the public sector. Not sure if the basic social security fund does that, but I'll need to check that.
164 2018-08-28 22:24:41 I do not invest for capital appreciation only.  the values of my properties do not need to appreciate in value for me to make money, although some have appreciated greatly in the same period of time and none has gone down in value like many stocks and mutual funds have. RK

167 2018-08-28 22:23:45 so these stocks that just ranup like crazy are now going to most likely start a reversal? watch for 1st red day?? Based on your teaching, yes?

177 2018-08-28 22:20:38 What resources do you suggest to anyone looking to begin investing in stocks? I have started saving a little money in a separate savings account because I was hoping to use those funds to invest in stocks.
178 2018-08-28 22:20:25 Okay I’m curious, during the OM auction, Shivaay didn’t have money on hand at the start, nor did he have backing. But Om is a millionaire artist, plus he still had his stocks and shares from the Oberoi business. Why didn’t he try to save the house/things??? #ishqbaaaz

182 2018-08-28 22:17:17 Neat trick: @RobinhoodApp adds (still commission-free) trading of 290 international stocks. Mostly (all?) ADR’s, haven’t spotted any China A-shares but several Hong Kong-listed companies. Still has never made a profit and never will but fun to play with until they go bankrupt.
183 2018-08-28 22:15:27 These are the 5 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:

184 2018-08-28 22:15:19 The @SEC_Enforcement is quite happy with Tesla staying public, since it will save the Wall Street from the Behemoth. I wonder where all the shorties would find the 30+ mln Tesla shares. VW history shows that the lack of stocks leads to at least 10x jump. This is a $120 bln ?
185 2018-08-28 22:14:50 What about wage growth? Most Americans don’t have money in these soaring stocks and struggle month to month. You helped the richest assholes in this country with your shitty tax cuts, what are you going to do to help the rest of us?
186 2018-08-28 22:14:21 If you were to post a tweet like this every night about the stocks that  were discussed... how much overlap would there be in any given week?  

Now, if you added Video Game Tournos, Pot, and Cryptos into that mix...   how much daily overlap would there be?
187 2018-08-28 22:14:05 It's nice to see someone be honest about it all. I became an engineer just because I missed my medical calling too. Now that I realize I don't REALLY LOVE that. I'm actually falling in love with day trading stocks.

191 2018-08-28 22:12:42 Great I'm already avoiding so many of these there are a couple of missed thank you for the list! Hope all of their stocks tank.
192 2018-08-28 22:12:20 so i guess u would say that about Trump and his gold gilt lifestyle and his bragging about the stock market?

peasants don’t care about the stock market they have no stocks!

agreed?
193 2018-08-28 22:11:53 @SEC_News what if Banks are knowing lying about certain “hope” stocks to make sure their expensive options they wrote payoff? What are you doing about this? They continue to lie constantly. People will suffer greatly if there is a shock to the markets
194 2018-08-28 22:11:38 U.S. stocks close  higher with

My teacher’s retirement system (CALSTRS) is probably the largest in the nation-it is heavily invested in the market. When the market is up-my pension is more secure. Is this a bad thing? I thought you liked tchrs

198 2018-08-28 22:09:27 Why not add a ban from having stocks in publicly traded companies? For that matter why not introduce term limts for both house and senate?
199 2018-08-28 22:08:56 Robinhood has some “global stocks,” and this was one of the highlights of my day.
200 2018-08-28 22:08:22 Kudos President Trump. Stocks & bonds have gone sky high too. Wonderful for many 'fixed income' folks supplementing retirement income.
201 2018-08-28 22:06:59 @SamsungLEVANT Samsung informs that in their policy they need TWENTY days to get a warranty item and that do not usually have stocks 
The hotline employee found that normal and tried to be rough 
 Samsung Lebanon fall so down there after sale service is unfortunatly the worst
202 2018-08-28 22:05:46 More than 50% of the country doesn't own stocks and this doesn't affect us!
203 2018-08-28 22:04:58 4+% GDP, Stocks at all time highs, taxes lowered, withdrawal from biased/unfair and bad trade deal/nuclear deals/climate deals. Cutting growth stifling regulations. Results matter. You just don’t like winning and you prefer a PC politician who only says what you want to hear. Sad

206 2018-08-28 22:03:33 Why do dudes get their entire check in cash then take pics with it? Like put that shit in stocks and bonds or something.
207 2018-08-28 22:03:23 This article is about cuts to the CORPORATE tax - NOT about income tax. Corporate tax cuts weren’t designed to put money in pockets. They were to stimulate growth. It’s why GDP & stocks are so high
Do you know what GDP is?
Everyone under around $120k got a TAX CUT.
208 2018-08-28 22:03:11 @ATTCares will you be caring about Cindy Liddick and her sick husband now that after 12 years she was laid off and is losing her health care?  Or should you change your handle to #ATTcare$  R Stephenson could have cared, but shareholders>people. 86% of all stocks owned by top 10%
209 2018-08-28 22:03:10 If you are have your money invested in stocks, don't forget about the Mark Twain's quote:“If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you're mis-informed.”

212 2018-08-28 21:59:34 An important question should also be asked. Do companies have to lay off large numbers of people just because the price of stocks goes down? My understanding is that payroll costs are only a small part of a companies expenses! So can't companies continue to employ people? Yes!
213 2018-08-28 21:59:31 Anyone in film: Be careful!

Me: I was about to do the opposite of that; invest in penny stocks, snort cocaine off a hooker's ass while popping a wheelie on the highway, running with scissors, but now that you said that I've changed my mind

214 2018-08-28 21:59:25 My biggest goal in life is to give not me but us a good life whoever that happens to be. Yeah I’m in the military and don’t make shit but you could complain like most about the little money you make or put it in some stocks and make it multiply. It’s all about the mindset.
215 2018-08-28 21:59:14 It’s understandable
216 2018-08-28 21:59:06 Trump doing another great thing - Mexico!  Trudeau to follow next. Stocks WOW!  Why can’t you celebrate what this President has done for the Americans?  The President was right saying the MSM are a danger to the American people!  You are by lying to them 24/7!

221 2018-08-28 21:57:27 Stocks have been incredibly resilient, absorbing all of the Negative Tariff/trade news in stride, even the political drama.. Now any near-term Trade agreement likely has little effect-Y,bad news can be ignored, just like Good news can be.. it works both ways..Best advice- Ignore
222 2018-08-28 21:56:15 Too bad we don’t see too many trump supporters responding to the question—that’s always good for a laugh. They say things like tax cuts! The stock market! If you ask how much their taxes were reduced or how many stocks they own, they either don’t respond or reply with insults.
223 2018-08-28 21:55:16 As mentioned..Indices at new highs constructive, Defensive positioning has waned, A/D at new highs, Credit in good shape.. BUT..Stocks near-term Overbought , ongoing Divergences, bullish Sentiment, bearish Seasonality, VIX divergence, Cycles important, suggesting BREAK near
224 2018-08-28 21:55:02 Gun shows. Quick access to ATF database for checks I can go with. As far as gun regulation data, what exactly do you want to state to do with? Everything you have mentioned is pretty much in place. I sense you're looking for a way to creep to a ban.
225 2018-08-28 21:53:56 I do own other stocks, I swear!! lol $ATVI's one of my favs. Got in @$69 & saw a nice pop. That's nothing! Huge long term growth stock!

226 2018-08-28 21:52:21 Law is already there on the fed level..Next. Cop killer ammo is banned. They did that ages ago. It is illegal to own armor piercing rounds. There is no such thing as civilian style assault weapons. It's illegal to own assault weapons.
227 2018-08-28 21:51:20 Has anyone seen how google did in the stocks today?  He never does anything that doesn’t benefit himself or his “friends”
228 2018-08-28 21:51:11 Federal law does not restrict individuals from transporting legally acquired firearms across state lines for lawful purposes except those explicitly prohibited by federal law to include convicted felons; persons under indictment for felonies; adjudicated “mental defectives”
229 2018-08-28 21:51:03 Remainers. In trying to wail against Brexit you are displaying ignorance. 

Under international law a state is entitled to a share of stocks based on the predominance in its waters. So the 60% the EU catches in UK waters is 'our' fish by law when independent.
230 2018-08-28 21:50:37 Market Close: MBS -16bps; DOW +14.38; NASDAQ +12.14; S&P 500 +0.78; 10yr Treasury 2.88%; consumer confidence and trade optimism helps stocks continue in positive territory.
231 2018-08-28 21:50:22 Read UNCLOS and straddling fish stocks. Clearly says co-operate on management. It doesn't say give away half and let your neighbour run your garden.

244 2018-08-28 21:43:17 $TLRY but but the valuation! Guys, short squeezes are not rational. I've seen stocks go 500% on even bad news. Strap in, ride it, and lock profits.. Over time,  the valuation will catch up as the stock unwinds.
245 2018-08-28 21:42:37 Yo lo de hoy lo interpreté como recogida de beneficios con menor volumen y caída que el lunes . Y hoy desde mínimos recupero muy bien .

Under international law a state is entitled to a share of stocks based on the predominance in its waters. So the 60% the EU catches in UK waters is 'our' fish by law when independent.
252 2018-08-28 21:39:40 10 companies do not represent the economy. Nor does the GDP unless all government growth is deducted from the total first before looking at the trend. Why did you not post the S & P or OTC stocks? Doesn't it follow the narrative you want so you feel superior?

Whatever you do with the value in your possession, you are implicitly basing that decision on some sort of prediction.

375 2018-08-28 20:36:39 What does it mean to the average citizen the Common Man or woman? Fewer than 2% on stocks.! 
Since the political parties especially the GOP allowed Trump to unilaterally break agreements that were mutually agreed-upon, American capitalism is becoming unstable thanks to Trump
376 2018-08-28 20:36:08 RT Nicholas_Merten: So Jordan Belfort, the infamous “Wolf of Wall Street” claimed that #bitcoin is a scam because:

1. There’s demand around it
2. The supply is controlled

Yeah, kind of like stocks, bonds, and pretty much any currency that hasn’t hyper-inflated to death.

379 2018-08-28 20:33:21 But isn't he making exactly that when he talks about a favored few and then offers increase in wealth of Ambani and Adani by way of evidence? And that wealth is largely the stocks.
380 2018-08-28 20:33:19 The sheer number of bears calling for a major pullback, recession or market top right now leads me to believe that stocks could continue to run for the foreseeable future. 
Recessions don't happen when everybody calls for them.
381 2018-08-28 20:32:48 Okay, I've moved on from going insane over @usps inability to deliver packages and have begun buying penny stocks in a misguided effort to get rich by Friday.

384 2018-08-28 20:32:02 currently the NRA is one of the few organizations fighting for 2nd amendment rights. Also trump has been sucky on guns.  He supports bans on bump stocks. which is retarded.

389 2018-08-28 20:29:52 @ByronBernstein Can you have a stream/make a video about stocks. I've been wanting to get into it for a long time but since I don't have the money to learn from experience, it would be greatly appreciated if you, who has a lot of experience (it seems), could teach us.
390 2018-08-28 20:29:52 Do you use weekly’s, daily’s or sessions for stocks?
391 2018-08-28 20:29:14 You should be shorting the MJ stocks like @MarxistTrader

396 2018-08-28 20:27:41 I will anyway have a comfortable life but I will settle for $10 price. Otherwise I have my stocks to bank on 
397 2018-08-28 20:27:39 The economy under Trump is not better because the DOW is up... So a bunch of rich folk feel good buying back stocks and spending money Trump gave them in tax cuts. Wages are flat for the middle class..have been for a while. That's the gauge of a strong economy.

Accordingly, if transfers from the country1 to the country2 exceed the reverse transfers, the exchange1 will have to constantly replenish the stocks of XRP?

Would anyone say I don’t want that beer?
415 2018-08-28 20:17:04 The majority of my stocks took a big ol' dump today
416 2018-08-28 20:15:29 Just so you know, this index is mostly composed of Tech stocks. Especially ones that you have had some sort of beef with. So while its a good thing, its not something you can take credit for except cutting their tax rate way below 21%.
417 2018-08-28 20:15:12 Bit 113% this year only seems scary. Is that your top pick regarding up and coming stocks?
418 2018-08-28 20:15:08 Already knew this but today reaffirmed it: sometimes in trading, it's just better to sit back and watch rather than try to make lemonade out of lemons. Patience is how you win. #stocks #trading

423 2018-08-28 20:13:08 One strategy that has been working for me lately is using the 5min charts, not diving right away on trades but waiting for sideways action then setting a stop just below that incase it breaks. Worked most of the time. Limits loses. #stocks #potstocks #trading

426 2018-08-28 20:12:25 If each person would ignore the “news” and focus on the individual impact of Trump in their personal lives they would have; lower taxes, more money in their stocks, 401K, IRA. Better job opportunities at higher wages.I wonder if they hate Trump enough to reverse these wins?

443 2018-08-28 20:05:24 Its really cool  to hear the 1:00 pm bell ring. ive been focusing on learning more about the stock market as opposed to buying new stocks. ima deep diver I mean dive deeper lol :)

Same laptop since 2011, even when office changed it- I still use my old faithful. When I think- stocks, crypto..perhaps?

459 2018-08-28 19:58:48 Buying of stocks isn't as simple as the term buying, it's more like you investing a certain amount in funds after duly analyzing a pair due to technical analysis or fundamental analysis then putting your investment as risk and predicting the market going up or down
460 2018-08-28 19:58:39 Google has problems outside the US. Its issues transcend Trump's verbal diarrhea. Most tech stocks are vastly inflated according to some analysts, and overdue for a big correction (tech bubble burst). Trump might trigger, but fundamentals are the cause.
461 2018-08-28 19:58:30 So Jordan Belfort, the infamous “Wolf of Wall Street” claimed that #bitcoin is a scam because:

1. There’s demand around it

Yeah, kind of like stocks, bonds, and pretty much any currency that hasn’t hyper-inflated to death.

463 2018-08-28 19:57:59 I recall reading something a while back about fish stocks in Montana streams declining due to higher water temps. Tho for MT the glaciers were so small that could be due to changes in snowpack (precip) as you mention.

474 2018-08-28 19:52:58 I agree, & IL R's have tried, but the D side wants more and more than what we are willing to compromise. If it doesn't have ALL, they have no interest in the bill. Last year with the ban on bump stocks and D had a overreaching bill, and R had a in the middle bill. Neither passed.
475 2018-08-28 19:52:12 I told my House rep. He should support raising the age of buying pistols and rifles with high capacity magazines to 21. Bump stocks, whatever. A gun is much less accurate fired full automatic. Our kids go to pre-K together. Problem, he'll probably be voted out if he does that
476 2018-08-28 19:51:54 all trump has to do is start mentioning who funded google originally, etc. total deep state project! How many other ceos/founders and stocks does the deep state/wall st complex CONTROL?
477 2018-08-28 19:51:53 That's why we voted you in, to fix these trade debts & help bring jobs and prosperity back home! Democrats and liberals are globalists who would sacrifice America and its citizens for illegals or rising stocks in other countries while homelessness and unemployment skyrocket here!
478 2018-08-28 19:51:50 The type of bidding war pricing activity that occurs at auctions - is what we're seeing in the NASDAQ (ex. the FOMO no price is too high bidding of tech stocks -rather than rational pricing /valuation) this can't be a good thing? $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA

481 2018-08-28 19:49:20 So like today in class I was watching this guy play stocks & he made $300 in like 5 seconds 
482 2018-08-28 19:48:58 @andrewcuomo you are a corrupt and lying governor. Your family has carried NY purse strings for years. You are dilusional and have such a hate for the good people of the Unitd States. You should leave the United States, because it isn’t great. How is your stocks growing?
483 2018-08-28 19:48:34 But stocks are UNDENIABLY "expensive." If you want to argue that "they're expensive but can go higher," fine, but by any reasonable metric the stock market currently has a record (or near-record) allocation of wealth in it.
484 2018-08-28 19:47:34 Best Buy stocks nothing but the triple A-eist of triple A’s. But yeah that’s just ridiculous.
485 2018-08-28 19:46:36 apart from the perms-bulls, I don’t think anyone except Brent is really saying stocks can go higher.  Think about what is intellectually more difficult to do.  Getting here on twitter and saying stocks can go higher, is way more difficult than arguing they are expensive.

488 2018-08-28 19:43:50 Not prudent to make too big a deal about one stock, but given so few stocks have pushed the mkt higher,  I would think the goog being Down 12 would result in the spoos being down more than a handle or so?
489 2018-08-28 19:43:17 @Qualcomm  your max tender amount was $67.50 and now the stock is $69?  What gives?  I don't like this.  Is this legal?  #stocks
490 2018-08-28 19:42:54 Stocks reacting to emotions is not proof of a successful trade deal. Wait for the details in fine print, then form an opinion. Wait for results and posses empirical evidence of success, or lack thereof.
491 2018-08-28 19:42:35 You can buy some otc stocks on Robinhood. Quick glance $acbff is available now @RobinhoodApp  let’s get all otc trading avail. That would be awesome. Nice progress guys
492 2018-08-28 19:42:06 I would rather own stocks any day of the week over a volatility adjusted equivalent bond position.   They both stink and are stupid expensive, but bonds you are almost guaranteed to lose.

494 2018-08-28 19:41:31 Thank you Hammer! Indeed. From what he says, stocks like UUUU or UEC (apart from URG) may fit to his criteria. Could you understand it through an online translator? I will publish it in English too soon
495 2018-08-28 19:40:44 I just think the real market distortion has occurred in the bond market.   10 year bunds at 40 bps?  30 jgbs at whatever stupid level they are trading at?  With stocks, you’re focusing on a real asset that might actually hold its value when all of this gets debased to infinity.

500 2018-08-28 19:38:09 I feel like every asset is overpriced so to use a particular metric on stocks and is not the correct way of thinking.  If stocks crash, then most likely cap rates on commercial real estate will soar, antique cars will plummet, credit spreads will explode, real estate goes no bid.

502 2018-08-28 19:36:41 Found you to be very fascinating.
Started trading stocks about a year ago.
It forces me to get out of bed in the morning.
I enjoy it.
It’s fun.
It’s challenging.
I keep up with current affairs.
I know what is happening in this world.
AND
It’s profitable.

Thank You Warren
503 2018-08-28 19:35:52 @mj_1770 no, but you can short stocks with it.
504 2018-08-28 19:35:36 if you don't have stocks in the stock market you haven't seen any rise in income over the past 10 years, after the bank created recession that took away 50% of my 401k, when i had a 401k. the bankers and wall streeters need to spend some time in jail, instead of getting richer

507 2018-08-28 19:34:30 Enough.  We need a Joseph Welch moment - $TSLA is not even in the top 25 shorted stocks by the only metric that matters: % of float shorted.  SHORTS ARE SYMPTOM OF A VOLATILE STOCK BELIEVED TO BE OVERVALUED. This "short vs. long" BS is also a symptom: a disturbed and paranoid CEO

510 2018-08-28 19:32:57 Direct market manipulation by someone like the @realDonaldTrump should be illegal. Someone like @elonmusk tweets and is investigated by the SEC, yet someone like Trump tweets to bash or pump a stock, sector, or industry... and no one cares?

529 2018-08-28 19:27:52 Stocks at new highs, consumer confidence at 18 year high, economy 4.2 GDP (or better), and the media having 'fits' that it hasn't, after 585 consecutive days of trying, been able to 'bring down' the Trump Presidency-  but they are still trying.

532 2018-08-28 19:26:25 If companies can be successfully sued over it, they shouldn't be doing it. Shareholders, boards and executives need to know if companies are incurring liability or violating the law. Disclosure prices stocks accurately and keeps companies operating legally. #corpgov
533 2018-08-28 19:25:51 Anyone noticed that Financial Media Outlets are just as fake as the rest of MSM? They create volatility through fear mongering. They translate news skewed to favor certain stocks...I don’t believe it is unconscious bias.

539 2018-08-28 19:22:24 Fraud. He suggested 65 stocks in 40 days and when midcap started correcting - no exit alerts given even when stocks were down 40-60% from buying price. Of 65 stocks, 2-3 stock 4-5% will go up and his jingalala msg would come. Fraud + zero knowledge= 100% trap
540 2018-08-28 19:21:38 Paul, as long as you stay out of the stocks with very low liquidity, you won't experience these flash crashes. I was in AMD yesterday as it was climbing up... then the stock reversed and my stop loss (or rather trailing take profit) worked as expected.

547 2018-08-28 19:18:38 So where do you draw the lines between criminal laws, violations of ethics or morality (including power dynamic issues), and just bad behaviour? How much punishment is enough? Who should decide? Should we just go back to the stocks and public shaming?
548 2018-08-28 19:17:43 He always does these veiled threats.  Concerning banks, stocks...he is a gangster and the owners of big business are his connections.  Lots of Corruption and blackmail is going here.  Follow the money.

Look at what's really happening in this country; how can you deny economy,  unemployment,  stocks, trade deals, savings of billions of dollars.

573 2018-08-28 19:11:43 The  effect of the sanctions in simultaneously driving down both the ruble  and the Russian stock market has allowed the Russian government to sell  dollars high and to buy up Russian industrial stocks low, effectively  re-nationalizing Russian industry at bargain-basement prices
574 2018-08-28 19:11:17 Sad they don't know what the only thing you did is going to do. They would be saving for the down fall coming.

624 2018-08-28 18:47:18 dudes play stocks and screenshot pictures of their stock rising .93 and saying “idk how y’all do that 9-5 shit”
625 2018-08-28 18:46:32 The most of the "tech stocks" in Pakistan's bourse are witnessing an inflated bubble like that witnessed in "Dot com bubble" 
Current prices of Netsol,Sys, Avanceon etc. dont justify their earnings
626 2018-08-28 18:45:19 Finally back in the green ..glad I stayed strong and held on to those stocks

632 2018-08-28 18:43:11 I'm just hoping I can buy all of the penny stocks warrenbuffet99 is going to recommend before everyone else does.
633 2018-08-28 18:42:23 And still the economy booms & stocks skyrocket, while families are feeling so positive about their own financial condition with the “crumbs” they get from their work & Trumps numbers climb. Life is good!
634 2018-08-28 18:42:12 @PowerLunch Interest rates driven down to Zero by Fed interfered in the Free Market to benefit stocks & consumers-Some balance is reasonable 0% to 3% is just stealing from Retirees-Pension-Funds & Municipalities It is definitely not a Free Market exercise by our @federalreserve

645 2018-08-28 18:39:21 No.  Even professionally managed portfolios are losing or flat this year, and a lot of it is due to trump admin policy decisions & actions.  Just threatening a trade war can send stocks tumbling, for example.
646 2018-08-28 18:37:36 Wish I had some snarky comment on the markets today. I don’t. There’s barely anything going on of note. The pot stocks are finally getting slammed if for no other reason than this run-up has been awfully fast. $BTC over $7k and small #crypto rallies. S&P sits at ATHs about 2900
647 2018-08-28 18:37:19 VIX very low. It is less 12.5 Complacency high. Stocks, bond market will be supported come hell or high water by the Fed and US, This will continue  as long as the dollar retains its reserve status. When the reserve status goes, which could happen suddenly, all hell breaks loose

651 2018-08-28 18:35:14 Those top 5 stocks would also make a good candidates for the DudeBro Empowerment ETF.

670 2018-08-28 18:23:41 I only invest in stocks beginning with the letter "A"

680 2018-08-28 18:18:42 Average sheep aaasking why the vix the Tv told them to buy didn't help with gigantic tech stock losses and why Chinese stocks they said to buy went down twice what the FXI went down. No answers of course.
681 2018-08-28 18:18:12 @AOTtrades Hey Stewie, how do you determine the triggers and targets for stocks? On the PEG list you say if it triggers over X target is Y but how do you pick those prices?
682 2018-08-28 18:17:51 Were you saying "In next crisis, foreigners will use stocks rather than UST's to gain exposure to USD"?  That's not what I understood you to be saying; it is what they're saying, & it has monumental implications.  If I misunderstood you, my apologies.
683 2018-08-28 18:16:37 This year as I flipped through chart after chart with the qqq chart above it I realized there wasn’t much difference in volatility or upside between a 2x or 3x index etfs with 100% of your money in it vs 10 different stocks with 10% in each. Is stock picking even a thing?

685 2018-08-28 18:16:07 Trump is now accusing Google of left-wing bias. In their defense, let me point out that they were selling bump stocks on Google Shopping as recently as February, sponsored CPAC, and have donated large sums to candidates like Ted Cruz and the white supremacist Steve Scalise.

694 2018-08-28 18:11:00 Why isn’t investing in stocks considered gambling?
695 2018-08-28 18:10:48 By the time you’re trying to figure out how the current news cycle will impact stocks, the market has already moved on by over- or underreacting to that news. It’s messy but that’s how things work.
696 2018-08-28 18:10:43 Every school office must have stocks of these girly needs on sale or for free. Government must fund this too. As a teacher who has worked in schools here and in the UK I feel very strongly about this. Girls and women are marginalised where this matter is concerned.
697 2018-08-28 18:09:59 I'm all for a UBI of some sort. Problem I have with this plan: if the govt invests in stocks & financial assets, wld create a huge incentive to interfere in the investment mkts.

700 2018-08-28 18:08:52 Bring it on when those bastards come over this side destroying our bass stocks.
701 2018-08-28 18:08:14 almost $40k worth portfolio of stocks, assuming net 2% dividend yield (30% tax rate, 3% gross is rather fair/safe assumption) it gives $800 annually, $67 per month + some special dividends + some companies are paying more, not that bad
702 2018-08-28 18:07:57 I get that, but when their stocks are declining while others are increasing or are unchanged, why support a company that may pull your favorite stock at any time?

Fuji seems really aloof (to me). I haven’t noticed any community involvement like Kodak, Adox, Ilford.
703 2018-08-28 18:07:24 You mean the bump stocks in Vegas?  The rifles with scopes, bipods on the forend, and the bump stocks that rely on a rhythmic pumping to function? Leaving the shooters utter stupidity aside, shall we move along to single events setting precedents for future laws opposed to data?
704 2018-08-28 18:06:21 Wearing a bandana will not change the fact the since @realDonaldTrump is in office, stocks are up jobs are up useless agreements are down & people have more money.
705 2018-08-28 18:04:22 And just like that, $VTL moving higher again much to the chagrin of short sellers. If someone is going to knock the $VTL investment thesis, all I ask is for factual accuracies, not nonsense.  #stockstowatch #investments #stocks

768 2018-08-28 17:32:42 Right which is ultimately the point i wanted to make... if your thesis is "buy vol/sell stocks" b/c of seasonality you are working with a flawed premise.
769 2018-08-28 17:32:34 a lot of debt over the years (even for companies its like Apple) was to juice stocks and/or satisfy activist shareholders unhappy with returns as they were at the time. 
If tax payers will have to bail out banks/corps for that there should be hell fire revolt.
770 2018-08-28 17:32:25 I only have 2 stocks but they keep going up! I only see positive and life is good.
771 2018-08-28 17:32:11 the more ultimate footage i see the more i think it could run 4 stocks just fine
772 2018-08-28 17:32:04 Typos.
Should read: 

By "oceanic uptake rates" I mean (1 - airborne fraction); excluding the land component, just ocean and atm. stocks, i.e. the annual fraction of an emission pulse taken up by the ocean.
773 2018-08-28 17:31:53 Until stocks no longer go up but correct a lot. Perhaps some savers may then wonder why a safe reasonable fixed income scheme no longer exists and discover the reason is governments had to be propped up with easy central bank money

775 2018-08-28 17:31:08 China gonna bounce down the line. Road back to transferring money back into China for a lot of Chinese traders is through $BTC_F. So expect a decent bounce in $BTC in short-term while China capitulates then money back into China stocks.

776 2018-08-28 17:31:06 Personally, I find all color Fuji to be cold, and Kodak to be warmer. I shot a *ton* of ektachrome in college.  I loved the stuff. Used to buy bricks of it, and get it processed on campus for $5/roll. 

Fuji also shows no interest in film, and Kodak is bringing stocks back.
777 2018-08-28 17:30:45 We export more to these countries and they need our product plus our 20trilliin dollar exonomy to sell their goods - these countries will cave like Mexico and the EU have and like Canada is doing right now so ur argument is false. Stocks all time high records and..
778 2018-08-28 17:30:37 Fishing nets are a large part of the ocean’s plastic pollution also.  Another reason to ban on deep sea fishing, in addition to allowing fish stocks to recover and only have sustainable fishing near shores.
779 2018-08-28 17:30:10 $AMD $SPY took a dump and is flushing stocks down.. we’ll see what happens with the 2.5 hours remaining. $MU $AAPL $FB $GOOGL
780 2018-08-28 17:29:58 Typical response from the blind Democratic Party. Look say whatever you like. I look at results. How is this helping Americans. Jobs are great, paychecks are bigger, my stocks are amazing since April 2016 up 10 grand from 2017. And that’s only one portfolio. NAFTA med costs

784 2018-08-28 17:28:27 By "oceanic uptake rates" I meant (1 - airborne fraction); excluding the land component, just ocean and atm. stocks): the annual fraction of an emission pulse taken up by the ocean.

793 2018-08-28 17:24:08 some of best eps growth stocks this year, beating estimates and forecasts for 3 to 4 quarters running, including current and next year, have yet to budge upward or stay even. Just goes to show what a scam wall street has become; eps, peg, whatever you want or follow, meaningless
794 2018-08-28 17:23:40 @Deishma Sir, Thank you for your tweets on various stocks. I find it very useful to study. 
795 2018-08-28 17:22:44 Lol tweets and stocks is what I do
796 2018-08-28 17:22:09 Yeah that would great. The articles I read really criticize the big ask for taxes. It seems to me that if these authors understood MMT it could be argued that we don't need the wealthy, we just need the gov't to deficit spend, buy stocks, tell the fed to hold interest at 0%
797 2018-08-28 17:21:25 I have it. I was actually researching canibus stocks but was only see mad secondary market shit I need parts
798 2018-08-28 17:21:03 Hi @iManasArora bro. I'm trying to follow the tips you share and simultaneously reading @markminervini. However, being a  new entrant here, I am unable to screen accurately the set of stocks you filter out for #superperformance. Cud u plz help me with the Screener Query?

804 2018-08-28 17:16:33 Cutting taxes on Corporations and Wealthy (yourself) so they can repurchase stocks to cause stocks to inflate does nothing to help the working class as it increases debt and causes inflation.
805 2018-08-28 17:16:32 your tweets are a store house of info. it sheds light on so many issues not just economy or stocks but also politics. i always found them riveting & resourceful. please continue to post tweets. i read them every day and reply too whenever i have a point to make
806 2018-08-28 17:16:22 I need to read up on stocks......and invest my earnings there

808 2018-08-28 17:13:47 Most American's over 50%, do not own stocks. The rich get richer, and the gap of middle class in very narrow. we will be like Venezuela if we don't stop widening the gap.

811 2018-08-28 17:12:59 Chris, I helped to develop this BS narrative in the 1980s.  Trust me on this one.  It is complete and total BS.  Everyone knows there are investors who seek out low risk, high dividend paying stocks (see utilities).  No reason banks shouldn't be utilities rather than high flyers.
812 2018-08-28 17:12:00 I don't just trade one asset class like #crypto.  
I like to have 3 trades open in different asset classes to diversify risk & trade focus. 
I don't care what asset class it is so long as I can see a clear trend on daily & 240 min.

815 2018-08-28 17:10:17 So, back to the original topic, how does any of that explain the lack of wage increases, while everything else has been increasing (stocks, jobs)?
816 2018-08-28 17:09:45 Whenever this bull mkt ends, there are a number of overvalued stocks that will get murdered. WeWork is a great example.
817 2018-08-28 17:08:25 If there’s two stocks I need to stop sleeping on its apple and Nivdia... stock market hurry up and crash so I can cop.
818 2018-08-28 17:08:04 Yassss the rich getting richer win for the low income peeps and the middle class who own a ton of stocks...smh
819 2018-08-28 17:07:38 Poor are profiting from it the most? Now you're just obviously making stuff up. Look at how much the top 1% and the corporations are saving. And then they're just buying back their stocks, not reinvesting.
Then talk about the tariffs.
820 2018-08-28 17:07:29 Aren’t stocks fun?! Because when the market does well rich people get richer! And when then market does bad poor people lose their jobs.
821 2018-08-28 17:06:29 It’s all the investments made by US and round the world who’s made stocks go all time higher . Dow Jones will go up even more . 27 000 next friday :)

824 2018-08-28 17:03:13 I support you too. The economy is doing great. Stocks are making lots of money.
825 2018-08-28 17:02:41 And Powell's dovish comment on Friday may have put stocks in a bubble again. Tightening and loosening rates is like a "Curling". Throw the stone, use the broom, don't use the broom, faster, slower, who knows?

840 2018-08-28 16:55:06 1. The media divides this country with its racebaiting 2. The top 4% are the only people who own stocks? 3. The tariffs are temporary while he negotiates better trade deals. 4. Asking our allies to pay more and cut fair deals is business. We don’t need political correctness
841 2018-08-28 16:54:23 I see it now Joe! I get so many notifications, it slipped by. I definitely am keeping an eye on it and agree, the semi's stocks reversing is worth noting. Just gotta get through the light volume of this last week leading into the holiday. We need normal volume.
842 2018-08-28 16:54:22 $SPY So many stocks I'm seeing (positioned in) slowly gaining strength. Bulls grinding it out!
843 2018-08-28 16:53:56 The stock market does not reflect the economy. High stocks means rich people are making money. You want a true picture of a good economy, look to the middle and lower economic classes. Spoiler; they aren't doing well at all.

850 2018-08-28 16:51:27 Sorry to mention this, but I think it is kind of important.

854 2018-08-28 16:49:17 Agreed. One of my biggest factors in evaluating stocks is management track record. Baobab honestly is not a factor for me. I do think they contributed to the undervaluation though. The big factor is Glasier. Not only years of industry experience but unquestionable success.
855 2018-08-28 16:49:08 Invest 25 million in stocks.
856 2018-08-28 16:48:54 Why I continue to support bringing back the use of STOCKS in the public square.

866 2018-08-28 16:42:56 Yes that's great the rich get richer.
Since you took office households with income between 100000 and 200000 made $4,500 on stocks they owned.
Households with over 400000 income made 430000 on stocks they owned
867 2018-08-28 16:41:40 I’ve been playing with stocks for about 3 yrs now. I still check daily. I started a second account with the Robinhood App last year and love it for free trades on stocks.

874 2018-08-28 16:39:30 What country are you living in? US consumer confidence rises to 18-year high, The benchmark for large-company U.S. stocks hit a closing record Friday and again Monday, Unemployment Rate Drops To 3.8 Percent, Lowest Since 2000.  Most of America think that is good.
875 2018-08-28 16:39:08 Most of the folks I know can't afford stocks.

880 2018-08-28 16:35:51 Stocks , real estate and workers!
881 2018-08-28 16:35:35 Yea but how many failed stocks did he also pick and how many folks lost money because of it?
882 2018-08-28 16:35:34 Rebuttal: You just built a wall of worry for stocks to climb! :)
883 2018-08-28 16:35:14 The stock markets are hitting all time highs because corporations are buying back stocks with money they’re NOT paying in taxes. EPS spread over a smaller pool of outstanding shares. When corporations don’t pay taxes, American debt increases.
884 2018-08-28 16:34:49 It's going to give more fuel for future terrorists wanting to get revenge on the west. But the war machine companies like that because as long as there's "terrorists" to hunt, their stocks are up.
It's a massive crisis and it's just blatantly ignored by everyone. Shameful.

886 2018-08-28 16:34:25 First of all 83% of stocks are owned by a very small % of Americans; the wealthiest among us. So it’s not a good indicator of how middle America is doing.
887 2018-08-28 16:34:12 Stocks trading under 1M vol but with bullish momentum are mostly owned by hedge funds. This is my observation after scanning all hedge fund stocks.
888 2018-08-28 16:33:57 Ya sucks when stocks start taking premarket and I miss them I hate that. Wanted ssc and missed the whole thing because it was down so far. Lookin back I see my entry but live it was down to far I stopped paying attention to it

893 2018-08-28 16:31:54 As expected, Stocks higher as the opening bell rings on Wall Street.
894 2018-08-28 16:31:18 An example of this is the idea that people will optimize for the strongest SoV in tokens. The argument makes tons of intellectual sense, but also assumes that 1) people behave rationally; 2) will navigate complexity to trade to better SOV; 3) won't view tokens like stocks, etc.
895 2018-08-28 16:30:14 In the Nifty Midcap 100 index, 46 stocks were replaced effective from April 2, 2018

896 2018-08-28 16:30:01 And morality all time low. Stocks no indication of economic health. Inflation up, earning power precipitously down, no Wall no hcare, no NKorea accord, no Russia agreement, more opioid deaths, worse VA, that’s the trump legacy
897 2018-08-28 16:29:59 - options ain’t the place to start if you don’t know shit about stocks. I tell you that much. You don’t know preservation stategies, the Greeks (gamma, delta, theta..), implied volatility (iv)....

900 2018-08-28 16:28:48 The main political attack against this will be the potential for centralized government control of the economy (besides the tax increase). We should give the actual voting power of the stocks in the fund to the employees of those corporations.

907 2018-08-28 16:27:22 Stocks firmed on Tuesday, tracking their US counterparts, as investors welcomed a new trade agreement between Washington and Mexico.

The main-share PSEi rose 78.14 points or 1.0% to finish at 7,844.61 while the broader All Shares added 30.31 points or 0.64% to 4,759.13.

I have a small business and my husband is enlisted, we don't have stocks.

917 2018-08-28 16:22:36 For high street stores to survive, it seems they must do one of: a) concentrate on "desperation purchases" (cables, medicines), b) have reliable stocks and knowledgeable staff, or c) sell things that people (sometimes) prefer to see before they buy (e.g. clothes)
918 2018-08-28 16:22:30 Amsterdam AEX is also at all time high. The stocks are high world wide. This is alarming. Soon a lot of people are going to lose a lot.

938 2018-08-28 16:14:31 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS your administration has had more people indicted, found guilty and gone to jail in less than 2 years for the first time in the history of this country!

We’re more concerned with that!  In case you’re too stupid to know, MOST of us don’t have stocks!
939 2018-08-28 16:14:10 How do feel about @FannieMae and @FreddieMac #stocks that are stuck in #government #ownership? Completely unconstitutional action by an #unconstitutionally structured agency in @FHFA! #fanniegate $fnma $fmcc

945 2018-08-28 16:12:41 Tax cuts, trade deals etc are helping to prolong the bull run BUT DIFFICULT to justify EXPANDING $SPX PEs ESPECIALLY AHEAD of midterm election. If the Dems win the House, the $SPX will get crushed. If not, we'e priced in. SO WHY chase stocks AND RAMP UP YOUR RISK into elections?
946 2018-08-28 16:12:32 @AnilSinghviZEE Pl tell your viewers this is a trap bull run. Generally in a healthy bull run nearly majority stocks participate, but this time only selected stock does. Whereas in a bear run all stocks drops... Big SCAM
947 2018-08-28 16:12:00 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $COTY, $PCG, $QCOM, $INCY, and $ALK.
948 2018-08-28 16:11:20 Not a problem - I'm heading back to Edinburgh in October so I'll nip in and see if they have any new stocks of T-shirts then. Have a great evening, my friend x

950 2018-08-28 16:10:21 - no cap. When I first started trading stocks and options in ‘14 I turned $300 into 15k from May - August.
951 2018-08-28 16:09:29 Indeed! The French CAC is still below 2000 levels. But the direction of the markets remains parallel. It’s like value stocks lagging growth and a lot of it is the sectorial display variance. (1/2)
952 2018-08-28 16:09:29 No Kirby is limited for having no fast moves, no overhead protection, and no way to take short stocks while being light and floaty and dying early herself.

956 2018-08-28 16:07:27 Who here is heavily invested in NASDAQ index funds? Most Americans aren't, the only people who should care are people who have money in it. Most people couldn't tell you where their 401(k) is, which is the only real investment they have in stocks. Real wages SUCK!
957 2018-08-28 16:07:23 Market is going higher because stock analysts only look a few quarters ahead and rarely consider black swan events such as debt/currency crises.  If you exclude tail risk, US stocks look like a buy.

964 2018-08-28 16:03:36 Stocks were doing great before #Trump. The bull market started in 2009! Donald been POTUS for under 2 years of it.  They will do fine after him too. Stocks would be doing alot better if they did not have to deal with Donalds legal drama.

One straw is that the VIX hasn't gone down on this three day surge in stocks.  Thoughts out there?
993 2018-08-28 15:53:11 Please provide a verifiable source for this claim.  You do know that everyone who has a 401(k) or a pension owns stocks, right?
994 2018-08-28 15:52:46 Busy buying stocks!
995 2018-08-28 15:52:28 There are some traders (fucking newbs I presume) that just refuse to believe that stocks dont go up forever.

1011 2018-08-28 15:47:02 Good value for the Titans. A 2nd round talent for a 6th round pick is how a GM quietly stocks up on talent.
1012 2018-08-28 15:46:27 You just hate the stock and its supporters, you don't know how it's going to turn out any better than any one else. You make money with clicks, that's why you have strong opinions about stocks with high interest.
1013 2018-08-28 15:45:59 Yeah, the victims need a path to recovery before we think about "redemption" for the predators. Can we take Louis out of the stocks in the town square now? Sure. But that's about as far as we are, imo.
1014 2018-08-28 15:45:38 Calculate your total wealth to your exposure to stocks. Rebalancing it to 30-50% exposure to stocks depending on your risk appetite is the best way to face the market
1015 2018-08-28 15:45:38 How can that be? The 1990s is when everyone got rich on stocks.

Central banks

Federal reserve 
To big to fail private banks 
Stocks are controlled and manipulated by the establishment, you feel secure with the establishment ? I don’t, and that’s my reason to be here

Upending the balance would have serious ramifications that should not be disregarded. Important to contemplate the disparity between Iran and SA when it comes to stocks of munitions and what that imbalance means.

1050 2018-08-28 15:33:07 It’s weird how now that I’m like 90% cash I want this to happen to. You learn your lessons to not chase stocks at specific price points. Well at least I have learned that with this sector. Keep going lower so we can buy in!!!
1051 2018-08-28 15:31:50 You’re right, he had a huge 8 year run up to his presidency... failed to mention that, didn’t ya. Also, inflation of stocks do to the tax cut going to them doesn’t really count. Ask a real financial expert

1054 2018-08-28 15:31:14 The POTUS with his silly stories that are believed by the moronic class may have contributed to the drop in price of Google so far today.

1069 2018-08-28 15:27:34 Aug. consumer confidence from @Conferenceboard rises to 133.4, UP from 127.9 in July, highest since Oct. 2000. Assessments of current situation and the future both edged higher. Solid job market/economic backdrop are helping and surging stocks don't hurt.

1073 2018-08-28 15:26:46 Stocks rose Tuesday, Aug. 28, the S&P 500 crossed 2,900 for first time and set an intraday record high as Wall Street reacted to news of a possible NAFTA overhaul that could lead to the end of trade disputes between the U.S., China and the European Union.

But aye remember. They’re inmates and juveniles out here fighting wild fires for $2 a day. And the crazy thing is they wouldn’t be able to use their skills outside of prison because of their record. Your senates have stocks in private prisons . 

Have a good day
1081 2018-08-28 15:22:09 I like how she attempts to replicate the invention of the stock exchange. What if people could buy ownership of the means of production? Wild idea! I bet it'd work better if the government bought stocks for you because as we know supply and demand don't drive prices.

1085 2018-08-28 15:20:45 NASDAQ is NOT the barometer for the economy of the general public.  Only 54% of Americans have stocks, either individual or 401K.  The only real benefactors are the 1%, and there is no "trickle down."

1087 2018-08-28 15:20:09 Please stop tweeting stocks. Such tweet will invite enemy to attack our economy bc they see u have no confidence to handle market downtime. Such tweet is a security risk for USA. IC must stop such thing happen again. U can tweet NFL that I hate but u can't tweet stocks.

So blue wave ppl think u r a security risk for USA is right. If enemy sees a @POTUS can't handle market downtime, they will attack our economy.

1110 2018-08-28 15:13:04 They are claiming they are a public utility with public stocks, so it’s not a private company.

1111 2018-08-28 15:12:25 According to research by NYU economist Edward  Wolff.

  10 percent Americans own 92 percent of all  stocks.
Good news to the richest Americans, who most likely didn't vote for you.

1281 2018-08-28 14:14:03 Most Americans can’t afford to retire or invest! The stock market is a prediction and is manipulated by the wealthy and corporations for their benefit. Like the fake Mexico trade agreement made stocks rise but there is no agreement without congress or Canada! Lol

1337 2018-08-28 13:58:19 That depends on what you're invested in.

Stocks are a bad investment option for retirement for this precise reason. You should be mostly invested in securitized assets like municipals, CDs, and bonds.

Park 15% in stocks with a dividend. You can ride out anything that way.

1396 2018-08-28 13:44:12 Sure, the tax break that has mostly gone to stock buy-backs increases demands on stocks and raises the price. But inflation is outpacing wages and the buying power of regular folks is diminished. You're a fraud.

1411 2018-08-28 13:39:37 Because market has a tendency to hurt as many people as possible, many market makers manipulate the stock daily.... Same is with Titan and ADAG stocks!
1412 2018-08-28 13:39:24 Yeah... hard to see where this goes. I believe (and wrote about) how I didn't like this setup leading into a Sept. long weekend. Cannabis stocks tend to sell when there's no material news out. That likely doesn't come this week. Move came too fast on old rumors. Monitoring....

1508 2018-08-28 13:04:51 Sir with all due respect, your trading strategies are for institutions or for UHNIs with huge capital...small traders can get similar returns, if not more, simply by trading in small/mid cap stocks...small traders don't really need f&o segment...am i wrong?
1509 2018-08-28 13:04:51 But he could tell you how it will increase profits of U.S. companies thus increasing share value and so making rich Americans wealthier. Remember that the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of stocks either directly or indirectly(as of 2016).
1510 2018-08-28 13:04:50 Warning:
The most important pointer is to not fall victim to “pump and dump” schemes. In such schemes, key stocks are heavily promoted. The stocks run up on the promotions. Those promoting stocks buy them before they start pumping and then dump them when mom and pop start buying.

1517 2018-08-28 13:02:36 One reason could be, that the richest 10% of the U.S. owns <84% of all stocks!
So when the stock markets go up, but the 90% does not get fair wages, the politicians are laughing behind our backs. The richest 0.1% own propaganda media like @FoxNews, to keep the crowd "happy".

1527 2018-08-28 12:58:07 Stocks are up but for who, really? Do we all benefit? No. Stop fooling yourselves into thinking we got it made and trump is god. Majority of Americans do not benefit from the stocks being up. How about that national debt?
1528 2018-08-28 12:57:57 Assigning to much accolades or blame for the economy to the President is a bit naive.  Most of the time the President is just along for the ride. Trump is responsible for stock market rise but at what long term cost? Tax give away to corporations made stocks spike & deficit too
1529 2018-08-28 12:57:52 Have you ever tried to transfer stocks from USA to Europe? If yes, you will know, why we need tokenized securities. Sorry I need to @ you here: @APompliano

1532 2018-08-28 12:56:14 No. The way to do that is to take on the @NRA and ban assault rifffles, require background checks, ban bump stocks and so on.

3: A declining stock market offers great value.
4: Buy & hold investments long term.

1546 2018-08-28 12:52:17 Yeah, when the rich get richer the poor, get richer. I know fucking teachers and grocery clerks that have stocks. Having stocks is near trvial, almost 54million Americans have a 401k. Now if this were the only economic boom during trump the it would be eh, but it ain’t.
1547 2018-08-28 12:52:09 $IGC getting demolished pre-market. that's why it's dangerous to hold over-extended stocks for too long. great decision to sell at $1.60 before the end of the day yesterday. thank you @timothysykes for the lessons
1548 2018-08-28 12:52:06 niggas always saying invest in stocks invest in stocks and don’t know which stock to invest in. just blindly putting money anywhere.
1549 2018-08-28 12:51:17 It’s only winning if you have stocks—which half of americans don’t.

1551 2018-08-28 12:50:42 In this market, all "story stocks" are run up to extreme levels. AMD has the potential to gain share against stumbling Intel over the next year, but as seen in the past -it won't be easy.
1552 2018-08-28 12:50:28 ...move? Are you following these stocks earnings announcements as well? You seem to trade different stocks all the time?

1558 2018-08-28 12:49:01 That assumes a certain amount of rationality and long term planning. Conservative capitalist practices will, for instance, cause fish stocks to crash, because to the conservative mind it is the practice of fishing that needs to be maintained no matter what, and not the fish stock

1562 2018-08-28 12:48:20 Hi Alok, How do you decide about allocation (position sizing) while investing in such high beta stocks with undoubtedly great momentum.
1563 2018-08-28 12:48:18 MY STOCKS HAVE GONE "SKY HIGH"!!!!!
1564 2018-08-28 12:47:50 Well the prints look real...but how do you actually monitor all these stocks to be ready to trade at the open? How did you know MVF would
1565 2018-08-28 12:47:09 And yet Repubs will still be telling people to get a job—even after they’ve started to barter lead-water stocks for radiated fish. long after the roving bands of supermutants raid the last supermarket, a stage 7 cancer patient can still be heard complaining about freeloaders
1566 2018-08-28 12:45:07 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 7 stocks Monday including $COUP, $DLPH and  $C.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 104% in $C where August 72.5 calls bought for $0.25 closed at $0.51.
1567 2018-08-28 12:44:13 Wow. That is perhaps the worst index of all time. Worse than the stock market. A 1/3 of Americans are employed in jobs that don't pay a living wage, can't invest in stocks, and you're measuring the wealth of those far removed from the suffering caused by this top-heavy recovery.
1568 2018-08-28 12:44:11 Pity you can't sneak up behind him and say "yes, yes" into his phone.

Make him buy a few thousand worthless stocks 
1569 2018-08-28 12:44:06 We strive to buy CLOSE to the entry price. Why? Better profits. But also keeps losses smaller. #stocks
1570 2018-08-28 12:43:05 The money from the tariffs goes directly to the government coffers, trump is only looking at the money coming in, not the money Americans are losing with jobs, he is for forcing a recession, he has money to invest when stocks nosedives. Vote Blue
1571 2018-08-28 12:43:01 Ti/Brent blowing back out.  Signals to me market is adjusting for US TA season and US wont have a problem with crude stocks in Oct.  Really beginning to look good for US in Nov and Dec.
1572 2018-08-28 12:42:04 As global investor (I'm buying stocks all around the world) my profits depend on world gdp growth. Today it is annually 3-3,5%. If it would be 5,5% (like in late 60-s) I would have about $2 mln, not $200 000 that I really have, cause it stocks and it contains all future profits.

1580 2018-08-28 12:38:21 could it be explained by the fact that {like 90% of the rest of your world} they were mostly 'fabrication' from the start?

1596 2018-08-28 12:31:06 So what does this mean for people who don’t own stocks?
1597 2018-08-28 12:30:32 @ChaseSupport you should allow people using "You Invest" trade penny stocks on the OTC market.  Your app already has the best pricing and money being available almost immediately is awesome.  But allowing us to trade OTC would be a #gamechanger
1598 2018-08-28 12:29:48 The solution: tell Alphabet (Google/YouTube), Facebook, Twitter and Verizon (Yahoo!) they are all companies with stocks traded on the US stock market and their practices online may be violating US securities laws.
1599 2018-08-28 12:29:35 The gov't is NOT issuing a lot of money.  That was during obama's years.  

BTW, this statement SHOWS you don't know what you're talking about: "companies are buying back their stocks."  Guru, companies do that when they see UPSIDE in their stock value.

1609 2018-08-28 12:24:14 I wish somebody teach me about stocks.
1610 2018-08-28 12:24:11 Yeah until it crashes. The government is issuing a lot of money and companies are buying back their stocks. It will fall next month. Get ready. Don't say I didn't warn you
1611 2018-08-28 12:23:42 from this side of the pond, i cant tell if there stocks are splitting or investors are tearing them up?
1612 2018-08-28 12:23:38 So? Wages are stagnant. Those with spare cash to play with stocks, and those at the top of the Trump ponzi pyramid may be raking it in, and then paying billions back in contributions to keep the ponzi going, but like all Ponzi schemes everyone else will suffer & it will implode.

1633 2018-08-28 12:12:05 But there could so many other issues such as she is not SEBI registered analyst and still recommending stocks. 

This is violation prima facie. One she is not registered with SEBI and two recommending the stock in social media.

1640 2018-08-28 12:08:27 Because Obama saved it from crashing AND helped it become strong again.   What Trump POLICY is resulting in strong stocks?
1641 2018-08-28 12:08:27 @101Beleggen houden jullie de cannabis stocks wel in de gaten ?
1642 2018-08-28 12:07:51 Too late but I would have gladly done that.  The stocks you get from this are generally good, albeit only one share, still good.
1643 2018-08-28 12:07:44 @dft er wordt heerlijk verdiend met nasdaq cannabis stocks maar jullie concentreren je teveel op hopeloze bitcoins.
1644 2018-08-28 12:07:37 Stocks are not the economy. Unemployment is relative only to those employed. There are far more unemployed and underemployed than reported. And the current economic credit goes to Obama, sorry, it is in spite of 45. What happens when he goes to jail?
1645 2018-08-28 12:06:16 I agree, diversify into real estate, gold, stocks, etc..., not shitcoins.
1646 2018-08-28 12:06:01 Translation: Stocks have increased only 30% under Trump vs. 150% under Obama.

1650 2018-08-28 12:04:00 It’s easy. He has to undo NAFTA because Obama created it. So he basically agrees to similar things with some useless tweaks with Mexico after he screws up stocks market so his friends could buy auto and other stocks at cheap prices and make millions. Quite simple.

1653 2018-08-28 12:03:05 It is because Pakistanis just made themselves into laughing stocks. @fawadchaudhry just said that a helicopter ride costs 55 rupees per trip and now my maid is asking for a helicopter. She says its cheaper than rickshaw
1654 2018-08-28 12:02:51 The 200 sma is starting to cross over the 50 sma on big cap stocks. The housing market numbers are down. Free trade has been replaced by tariffs. US companies are closing and moving to other countries.  The national deficit is growing.  The Great Recession 2 is around the corner.
1655 2018-08-28 12:02:25 Recently gotten into it too. What I've learned so far is to spread out stock in multiple fields. So try not put all your stocks in gaming companies, you want to spread them out as much as possible and invest in up to 20 different stocks. Start listening to AvanzaPodden! :)
1656 2018-08-28 12:01:49 $WPRT Jesus Christ what is taking so long ? $6 by year end. Undervalued, enough with the 10B  pot stocks already
1657 2018-08-28 12:01:36 So? Seeing as I along with 50% or more of Americans don't have stocks, it doesn't do a damn thing to for many of us.
1658 2018-08-28 12:00:38 You can trade $SPY but not stocks. Pre-market opens at 7:00 AM eastern
1659 2018-08-28 12:00:21 A message for all who are invested in L&T Infra and Birla pure value. 

I spoke to fund manager today. These funds are high beta. Meaning stocks will go up high & low fast. Just stay invested. When they will go up will be difficult to catch 

I am invested too
1660 2018-08-28 11:59:26 could have used a few more stocks but great one
1661 2018-08-28 11:59:09 Yes. There will still be merch sold onsite at the venue. But stocks may be limited. Given that the preorders on 11st is open until midnight 03/09
1662 2018-08-28 11:58:31 What a fake news this one. Nafta is gone,it's a new trade deal that put stocks in history high. Let that sink in.
1663 2018-08-28 11:58:18 Please provide stocks if i want able to get tomorrow i will be really dissapointed
1664 2018-08-28 11:56:49 The S&P500 is up 9.7% YTD (total return), and these stocks are 4.23% points of it
1665 2018-08-28 11:56:35 I agree fully, because stocks mostly only serve a few, whereas crypto assets can help any individual achieve Independence/freedom.

1671 2018-08-28 11:53:15 @cspanwj someone used poor judgement in the stock market..loaded up on what they were told was hot stocks by a scam advisor and they lost their ass. Now they have to pretend. 
1672 2018-08-28 11:52:57 Well, $CRON is getting tricky. I know $TLRY reports today and not to be a Debbie Downer, but it feels like an incredible set up to pull the rug (on these insane moves in MJ stocks) after they don’t meet expectations on the ER.

1674 2018-08-28 11:52:14 Therefore the majority of local fishermen are the correct group to involve as key partners in any vision for seafood. They understand the sea, markets, stocks, have the boats to catch, alongside the culture of fishing in their blood. #seafood #fishing

1676 2018-08-28 11:51:12 From a chart perspective, if there were no earnings today, there is a good chance I would of been long $SDA. As a trader our job is not to judge the stock or industry but trade what the chart says. Which is why $TLS & $AYS worked. Shit stocks but the market changed their view.
1677 2018-08-28 11:51:06 I remember that all too well. Started trading options March 2000 when penny stocks stopped doing it for me. Woke up one day entire acct down 50%.
1678 2018-08-28 11:50:16 I'm afraid I can't help too much with technical/tax stuff if you're not in Sweden since rules are so different outside of Sweden.

But in terms of stocks I'd just say start off safe, other with funds or big stocks & companies that you believe in and spread it out.

1680 2018-08-28 11:49:42 As to you, Greg, I’m glad business, and maybe your stocks,  are up. But it’s too bad your empathy for little puppies in cages does not extend to the human variety. Maybe a little less Fox News, Breitbart and Alex Jones might lessen your cult fixations.
1681 2018-08-28 11:49:16 Unfortunately none of them are publicly traded companies, otherwise I'd probably own stocks in all of them :/
1682 2018-08-28 11:48:50 Contribute to that 401K, stocks, IRA, college funds, trust etc. Set yourself and your kids up for success. Break that generational wealth gap. Even if you can only put in a couple dollars it’s literally better than nothing.
1683 2018-08-28 11:48:50 Thanks Mr. Trump, all my US stocks have skyrocket. your the best.
1684 2018-08-28 11:48:39 Llegamos a esta situación gastando más q lo q se produce. Hasta 2015 se pago con emisión y consumiendo stocks, dsp con deuda. Ajustar en serio nunca se hizo, pero seguí desinformándo, q es lo tuyo.
1685 2018-08-28 11:47:15 Yeah - small amount (thank God) - long for awhile. I hate Chinese stocks. Won't really touch them again after 2015.

YES 
1688 2018-08-28 11:46:12 The constant bearishness in stocks propels it to rise just as the perpetual bullishness in gold has propelled it to decline. The majority MUST always be wrong for that is the fuel that drives market movements.
1689 2018-08-28 11:45:21 @mimimayes13
Stocks way way up! Business confidence at an ALL TIME high.

1693 2018-08-28 11:42:33 NASDAQ is an index that tracks tech cos & many are consumer driven stocks.. Not sure if you understand what an index is lol....Are you in the 3% of US people looking for a job that doesn’t have one? If so, maybe you’re just a failure and based on your retort, a very dumb one.
1694 2018-08-28 11:42:28 If anything, couldn't the Mexico news prolong the China trade war? After Trump scored a big win he could think he can press China and they will fold like Mexico did. If investors know this, will it be a long slide for Asian stocks?
1695 2018-08-28 11:42:12 I've always wanted to do investing in stocks in some company's but don't know how to. Would love to learn more about it and start on my 1st investment as well before the end of this year. Any suggestions?

1697 2018-08-28 11:41:18 That’s great for all those that own stocks. For the average American who doesn’t, they’d like to know about their SS & Medicare- you know the things they were FORCED to invest in that Republicans are thereatening.

1708 2018-08-28 11:31:09 Europhia and pressure are funny things. In 2000, I remember people swiping their credit cards to buy ‘stocks of the day’ They didn’t know what the stocks of the day were. You have to position yourself according to where you believe the market is, or headed. Companies & Investors.

1710 2018-08-28 11:27:56 Also, with him falling out of the Big 3 last year, people are thinking all this media play is his desperate bid to investors as his stocks are expected to take another tumble at the end of the year. Pretending BP is as valuable as BTS in YouTube views is all he's got.
1711 2018-08-28 11:27:27 Most Americans own little or few stocks.  You are just creating a bubble. Let me know when you're ready to build a healthy and robust middle class. Oh wait, that will be....never.

1728 2018-08-28 11:15:39 1/2 I keep seeing people claiming that there’s going to be another big move in canabis stocks because $DEO has yet to take a stake in any names. While it’s likely, it’s definitely not coming at these valuations. Most big names are up over 50% in 2 weeks.

1746 2018-08-28 11:06:03 Thank you Obama for starting this Stock Market bulll Market. Many people don’t have stocks. This doesn’t benefit them at all.
1747 2018-08-28 11:05:18 Those huge tax cuts you gave to billionaires allowed them to buy back their own stocks in record numbers while the average American got screwed over AGAIN! Trump and his billionaire cronies get richer, while the poor and middle class get poorer!

1757 2018-08-28 10:59:54 Middle and lower class Americans cant afford stocks stupid. What have you done for them? No wage increases, higher gas prices higher cost of food at the market higher Health Care you've done nothing for the people of America that are struggling
1758 2018-08-28 10:58:35 I’m not a billionaire and i am benefiting.  Buy some stocks and try it.
1759 2018-08-28 10:58:01 Gundlach said 15 months ago that volatility would return soon and stocks were too high....wrong and wrong......Apple was $135, now $220......why do these guys keep getting media time to scare investors so they can then profit from a selling panic....

1761 2018-08-28 10:56:34 1 thing assuring after today's launch of POCO F1 in 65 countries is that the stocks wudn't run dry soon inspite of demand. Black marketeers are a big no.Buyers would wait for next sale if there are good chances of adding to cart @Flipkart @GlobalPocophone @IndiaPOCO #POCOF1

1768 2018-08-28 10:54:47 No you idiot It doesn't !! Which why your wages are lower than they were because  the corporations simply spent that money setting the stock markets on fire by trading among themselves (stocks buybacks)

1773 2018-08-28 10:52:48 Irish Medical Organisation said it had advised GPs to use the new illness certificate forms.

1774 2018-08-28 10:52:34 My cousin is little different, He looks for stocks to buy which are at all time low. He never buys which is at all time high. 

I always think, why is he not thinking that next day after he buys can make new all time low or high. 

Moral, go with fundamentals and techincal's.

1849 2018-08-28 10:11:08 Due to stock buybacks, primarily. 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10%. 50% of Americans own NONE. 

Meanwhile, working class and middle class wages are not keeping up with inflation. 

And the yield curve is approaching 0, presaging a recession.

1960 2018-08-28 08:45:55 So many reasons to be bearish on #djia

2058 2018-08-28 07:15:45 Never shun direct equity (stocks). They give you appropriate rewards with calculated risks. Invest in quality oriented growth stocks & take profits periodically. MFs should be used as long term wealth building mechanism. Invest through SIP & let them do their job, over time.

2120 2018-08-28 06:09:23 What sort of a disclosure is it by analysts / fund managers (appearing on tv) if the language used is “I often have...” or “I may have...” (exposure to certain stocks) ?!? 
2121 2018-08-28 06:08:39 Continuing from yesterday, the today's Japanese stock market have ended strongly. It is a dropping market since afternoon that we might ignore. I've bought some stocks today, but we could not prevent my losses. I guess that the loss would be like a purchase fee.

2123 2018-08-28 06:05:56 I think if we do see inflation take off, the Fed won’t raise enough because of US deficits—and we’ll see a massive devaluation of the dollar. The independent variables are inflation, rates and the dollar. Stocks will just follow (going up) as people run from neg real rates.

2185 2018-08-28 05:05:20 Not sure if fines are the way to go. Wouldn’t be hard to prove but they’d blame a glitch in the “algorithm”. Maybe what might work would be enact a way to halt trading of their stocks until they prove or provide and implement a solution.

2224 2018-08-28 04:30:24 You have a very short memory. When President Obama came to office, we were facing a huge recession. Housing market, stocks, auto makers, you name it all in downward spiral. We worked our way through that to relative prosperity.

2270 2018-08-28 03:38:39 Keep an eye on #Power / #Fertiliser stocks ........

strong move expected today.....
2271 2018-08-28 03:38:29 I know 12 year old’s who can trade stocks faster than 24 year olds who shave rocks.

2273 2018-08-28 03:37:34 Global debt cycle, long term/short term debt cycle, crypto and its relationship to everything else (stocks, currency, etc). 

Basically big picture stuff, which you already do a great job of. Just go deeper. 

I think we’re all burnt out on the next ‘buy/sell signal.’ Yawn
2274 2018-08-28 03:36:23 Stocks on my watchlist for the week 
PTC India
M&M
HCL Tech
MRPL
2275 2018-08-28 03:35:53 If we all buy & hold $SPY, the market would go up to where the risk/return isn’t worth it. Would you still buy $SPY if it returned the same as a govt bond? No, bc bond is guaranteed. $SPY isn’t. The market has settled on %7-%9 gains as acceptable considering the risk of stocks.
2276 2018-08-28 03:35:39 I don't follow either of the stocks closely or track their financials. But Yes, the products are ok. Not that they are of much use to me, but I still prefer buying their products as compared to stocks. I think Cupid announced a bonus issue as they couldn't afford to give dividend
2277 2018-08-28 03:35:32 You said; the shy is falling, the sky is falling. Trump got elected, the stock market is going to crash, we will be in WWIII, Hillary was cheated out of the election. FACT; stocks are soaring, housing market at record levels, unemployment is at all time low, GDP outstanding 1/2

2284 2018-08-28 03:30:28 Wrong & skewed portfolio is the answer. you need to check to which index your portfolio closely relates to in terms of performance to get an idea. I made a 1.02% on  stocks and 0.56% on mutual funds yesterday. I am still looking for the right balance of stocks in the portfolio.

2295 2018-08-28 03:24:43 That is very logical and I have been doing the same since a year now, but recently in the pharma rally, it became difficult to manage as stocks hit the shorted call strike price. This month I was stopped by cumminsind.

2299 2018-08-28 03:19:55 Breadth has been leading higher since the middle of August. The bid has been building up under the market and supporting the stocks against any selling. Finally, the prices advanced. Now, the question is how far the bid can overcome the speculative positions piling up in options.

2305 2018-08-28 03:16:04 All 4 hand-picked stocks by Sandro are winners! Thank you, Sandro.
2306 2018-08-28 03:15:57 I read this article about how   millennials don’t have any interest in investing(stocks, real estate, etc) and I really recommend everyone should take some time and do so research. You don’t need that much money to invest, especially in stocks. $100 can go a long way.
2307 2018-08-28 03:15:39 I just have to say again - we have no idea who @realDonaldTrump was talking to on the phone when he said it was Mexico!! It could have been 2 actors! He will do ANYTHING to distract from #JohnMcCain ! Also news of a “deal” drove stocks way up. Another federal crime?? 
2308 2018-08-28 03:14:40 Republicans are a laughing stock. They're only fooling themselves, thus making them look even MORE like laughing stocks.

3)I run my own resell business

2310 2018-08-28 03:14:07 As for bump stocks, real marksmen don’t need them or use them, they degrade accuracy. Wouldn’t care if thise went away.
2311 2018-08-28 03:13:06 Sounds like you're an AR15 expert. Pretty sure bump stocks make them incredibly inaccurate.
2312 2018-08-28 03:12:04 I guess all the snowflakes are melting over all the "WINNING!!!"

Not me - My stocks are up $20k, got an increase in pay, hubby's Corp. Tax is way down...
2313 2018-08-28 03:10:41 Five year estimates are dicey but, assuming that Trump can keep the deep State wolves in their cages, I forsee the longest expansion in US history cuz @realDonaldTrump grasps fundamental economics of LT growth & he pursues policies that maximize our GDP growth. Stocks advance too

2315 2018-08-28 03:09:21 We don’t make car @realDonaldTrump. We supply parts to your cars! Love all these service fees on your people. It’s hilarious. And yet my stocks keep going up cause you people keep paying. Enjoy your mess!
2316 2018-08-28 03:09:06 Pedotards like you push these pump and dump stocks and make people lose money. Happy it’s mostly other pedotards losing money from your scams
2317 2018-08-28 03:08:28 Liberals will never admit it, but they have to be saying to themselves “how can this President keep winning” stocks up, 401K up, jobs up, American pride back, approval % up, great deals being made! Even the MSM on full attack non stop, they keep looking like idiots!  R Prez!!
2318 2018-08-28 03:07:20 Any gun could be thought of as a weapon of War hell in the 1920s during the Chinese Civil War pistols were mainly used with stocks to turn them into carbines.

2322 2018-08-28 03:03:37 Infact one should be worried about liquidity impact of underlying stocks in equity mutual fund schemes, especially mid and small caps because the impact is built into the NAV and cannot be seen by the investor. ETF costs are extremely transparent unlike mutual funds

2324 2018-08-28 03:03:17 A failure. That’s why the stocks are so high and unemployment so low. I guess that’s why NK got together with SK and shook hands, haven’t tested any missiles since. Yeah huge failure.
2325 2018-08-28 03:02:51 There is nothing "Fake" on the chart, it's simply data. Your job is to read the data, not tell it what it should or shouldn't do, thats an easy way to lose your account.. #stocks #fx #forex #Trader #trading #investing #Motivation

2329 2018-08-28 03:01:17 ETFs are as liquid or illiquid as the underlying index,since all indices contain liquid stocks,ETF liquidity isn't an issue.

2343 2018-08-28 02:53:14 An AR is a "regular rifle." Research what the media is telling u. U are misinformed.

2345 2018-08-28 02:51:39 Unemployment rates may be down but wages have stagnated as corporate profits and CEO pay rises exponentially. This doesn’t help average American workers. Stock market also doesn’t indicate well-being for average Americans since most of us are not invested in stocks.

2356 2018-08-28 02:45:27 A regular rifle can hold only a certain amount of ammo and has to be reloaded often. From what I understand ar15’s and bump stocks increase the firing capability of the gun and can harm more people in a short amount of time.

2359 2018-08-28 02:42:13 This mkt high seems to be only for traders and large cap. Mid and small cap investors still wondering where is the high as many of the stocks ar trading 20-30% low from prev mkt high.
All around positive sentiment now make me skeptical of high, though i may b wrong.
2360 2018-08-28 02:40:49 also do know that Americans just argue and I tend to ignore anyone who disagrees with common sense.. if you can get ANY INFORMATION from this please mark them down with numbers! I have 1. a good agreement. 2 it was complex. anything I missed? He only drops american stocks... so?
2361 2018-08-28 02:39:14 Could the parkland shooter have killed the same amount of people in such a short amount of time if he had to stop to reload a regular rifle? And isn’t that what bump stocks are for?
2362 2018-08-28 02:38:19 But Jordan you were misrepresenting and pumping useless stocks ...... bitcoin is a groundbreaking open source technology!
2363 2018-08-28 02:37:59 That's not true,all those with 401Ks, retirement plans, people who buy stocks hoping for a better life.
They will all benifit.
2364 2018-08-28 02:37:21 But that's the thing, they haven't been trying to make it strict. They've changed no laws recently. They said they were going to ban bump stocks, then they didn't. It's just been one side saying to control them better, and the other side saying no. Nothing ever changes.
2365 2018-08-28 02:36:56 Means a lot coming from you @IncredibleTrade ...as @BonanzaTrade said would be nice if people join... we post our ideas on #Crypto #options and #stocks... #crypto bull run could start end of September so we might get more active there too... join us guys
2366 2018-08-28 02:36:22 Personally, I have no use for bump stocks as they reduce accuracy, so don’t care about them. And civilians do not have access to “military style weapons” which are arms capable of burst & automatic fire. You already have to be 21 to buy handguns from licensed dealers.

2382 2018-08-28 02:27:01 It was most interesting, till you jumped suddenly to an hative conclusion. Supply chain in electronics is robust. Never encountered true shortage.

2391 2018-08-28 02:21:31 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks rose to fresh all-time highs and Mexico’s peso rallied versus the dollar as the Trump administration closed a bilateral trade deal with America’s southern neighbour.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.85 percent.
2392 2018-08-28 02:21:15 Stocks in Japan, South Korea and Australia all followed their U.S. counterparts higher after President Donald Trump unveiled details of the agreement that he says will replace Nafta.
2393 2018-08-28 02:21:11 Asian stocks extended Monday’s advance after U.S. equities climbed to fresh all-time highs, as the Trump administration sealed a bilateral trade deal with Mexico.

2409 2018-08-28 02:19:10 My question is, if the results create that reset that the stocks need? How long will it last?Will the big guys realize that earnings really mean nothing at this point and eat the shares up? Or will this put some pressure on buyers to sell who got in at these levels for a few days
2410 2018-08-28 02:18:59 How it happens? Guns kill people. They are weapons. They are designed to kill. They are why people by them. They are why Armies use them. The USA is in a state of war from within its borders and the 2A is the golden goose of the NRA. Does the NRA buy cemetery stocks as well?

2418 2018-08-28 02:14:32 Across stocks, highest open interest (value terms) is held by RIL  (INR 69bn), HDFC (INR 52bn), HDFCB (INR 50bn), ICICIBC (INR 42bn), INFO  (INR 39bn) and AXSB (INR 33bn). Barring the HDFC twins, most of these  names are long heavy.
2419 2018-08-28 02:14:21 Those that laughed at me trading stocks ask me how i do it now 
2420 2018-08-28 02:14:17 I have mentioned in several different posts that all guns kill but the guy with a hands yesterday killed 2 people and injured 9, Vegas with multiple assault weapons and bump stocks killed 58 and injured almost 500, that's the difference
2421 2018-08-28 02:13:50 No, I believe that laws as far as background checks and wait period can be tightened. Military style firearms and bump stocks should be banned. Age to buy should be moved to 21. Many changes can be made.
2422 2018-08-28 02:13:45 stocks rise by 1%.

2436 2018-08-28 02:00:22 SP500/NSDQ hit all-time highs following announcement of new Mexican NAFTA blueprint. Materials/financials led. Shares of multinational industrials/financials jumped on enhanced foreign trade relations. Stocks buoyed by Fed Chair's comments on "further, gradual" rate hikes ahead.
2437 2018-08-28 01:58:52 I am not so gloomy. Quebec produces 75% of US aluminum due in large part to QC cheap hydro power. BC could be a big supplier of electrical power for Autonomous EV revolution.

2447 2018-08-28 01:45:28 Definitely one of the 4 button safes. I've heard a lot of good things from different manufacturers, but try to find a store that stocks them and feel them out for yourself!
2448 2018-08-28 01:45:07 My wife poopoo'd on my #bitcoin fanaticism earlier today, comparing them to common stocks. Rather than argue, I'll continue to silently buy and hold. Thanks to @tradingroomapp for the TA.
2449 2018-08-28 01:44:52 I have 72.96 in buying power. I want to be very wise on the stocks i invest in. I also want to make profit.
2450 2018-08-28 01:44:26 Yes...perhaps why Bernanke, Yellen so focused on keeping mkts up; why its critically important (bordering on US national security-type importance) that US stocks rise ad infinitum on low volatility.  Fail that, & things will get very weird, very fast.
2451 2018-08-28 01:44:04 Cyclical Stocks can deliver great returns but focus on:
1)Macro factors
2)Keep an eye on inventory
3)Right entry & exit
Read Peter Lynch's One up on Wall street for more details.

2470 2018-08-28 01:34:27 Ahh, yes. The military. All of these fools invest heavily in the war machine. Own companies, stocks, and all funded by you and I the taxpayer. The ultimate grift. And then they say we don't have money for investing in their fellow Americans. Fun times. Let me add..
2471 2018-08-28 01:29:37 The old man needs to uplift his agency reputation. Last year he was out of top3. So he needs more investors and raise his stocks. He needs more money to sustain his company and biz. Imagine using YT to mediaplay now. Cos the  sales cant no longer compensate.
2472 2018-08-28 01:28:49 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?” There are so many people that have lost their lives because you choose to do nothing. Their blood is on you.
2473 2018-08-28 01:28:08 I don't know but I'll trust the stocks that I have picked.  
2474 2018-08-28 01:26:28 Excellent points. The cutting of capex is not the stuff of growth stocks. Fidelity, T Rowe & Others have been selling down. The major reason is because of the capex cuts I believe. As a former growth PM I would be gone due to this development. We are just waiting for re-rating

2486 2018-08-28 01:16:14 US stocks posted strong gains on Monday, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting all-time highs, as the USA and Mexico reached a deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. US earnings continue to far out pace all other markets. US small and micro caps leading the way.
2487 2018-08-28 01:16:04 Sustained deficit seems a given if China keeps growing services deficit & keeps importing more USD-denominated energy/commodities at higher prices.  Commodities at 50-100-yr lows v stocks - what would China’s Current Acct look like if commodities were only at 20-30 yr lows?

2495 2018-08-28 01:10:51 One piece of advice if I may: avoid futures. So many opportunities daily with stocks, just avoid futures. The biggest, most well funded sharks are there daily and will slowly (or quickly) devour your account... and soul.
2496 2018-08-28 01:09:00 US stocks will already have gone up due to US tarriffs/quotas. Cannot buy shares in Rosatom or Kazatomprom (yet) and really risky state owned enterprises anyway. What is left...a few CDN Juniors and a few Aus juniors

2518 2018-08-28 00:54:30 US stocks rose on Monday as investors cheered a trade deal between Mexico and the White House to replace the North American Free Trade agreement and EU officials confirmed Washington was pushing for an agreement on tariffs
2519 2018-08-28 00:54:18 Yup yup, cause who cares about the fact that BRIM does make a difference? Or that extra RM450 will help stretch someone's food stocks for another 2 weeks? Najib's the one who introduced it so it must be useless & irrelevant kan?
2520 2018-08-28 00:54:13 So, all you @ABCaustralia watchers will be overjoyed that 
US STOCKS SMASH RECORD ON NEW NAFTA
TENSIONS WITH MEXICO EASE 
What, it hasn't been reported?
2521 2018-08-28 00:53:00 Me too, my stocks are sky high...
2522 2018-08-28 00:52:34 Congrats to the half of Americans who don’t own stocks. Yay.

2524 2018-08-28 00:50:19 reporting crimes and disturbances to the NICS system. Domestic violence (even having a restraining order against you from a family member) is ALREADY a federal prohibition against purchasing a gun. Full auto is a non-issue, imo. One isolated incident has thrust bump stocks into

2529 2018-08-28 00:43:27 The microphone setup was really amazing at Shine, I loved how you could hear the crowd chants, individual crowd calls, the clapping in between stocks etc.

I'd love to see more of this, really goes with the grassroots feel of the game
2530 2018-08-28 00:41:52 Stocks are going to get rekt in the near future.. real estate though.. im cool with that one.

2532 2018-08-28 00:41:16 Stocks do not trade on backward earnings.  They trade on forward earnings.  Tesla is not overvalued against forward earnings.  Tesla’s business model at scale will produce greater EBITDA margin than the legacy automakers.

2535 2018-08-28 00:39:58 I don't do shit lol. I literally just put money in it because my fiance told me to and never took it out. He used to look into marijuana stocks, but never had any luck.
2536 2018-08-28 00:39:02 I continue to buy BNB coins like I buy BTC.  I don't care what the price is because I invest for the long term...10 plus years.  As I have available fiat cash after each paycheck, I just buy more slowly.  Just like that old lady that has been buying Coke stocks since she was 25.
2537 2018-08-28 00:38:02 Liberals blamed Bush for 8 years, now they want to take credit for POTUS’s policies for the next 8 years. The stocks went up over a thousand points within weeks of his election. The large increases started that very next day. No doubt this is POTUSs policy not Obama.
2538 2018-08-28 00:35:32 Yall need to learn stocks before yall start playing with options
2539 2018-08-28 00:35:20 I actually own one, dick.  I don't have to short stocks to be able to afford one
2540 2018-08-28 00:34:33 Yes- what does sustainable mean? We think in terms of whether there’ll be enough for us. Marine mammals, birds, other fish etc. left out of equation. And fish stocks are crashing worldwide...
2541 2018-08-28 00:34:06 Stocks ain’t dope , dope !
2542 2018-08-28 00:34:00 need to see 7,500 again-was really hoping for a drop to 4,500 to 5k-but- we will see. For now it's just HODL, mine, buy some more of these alts I believe in while their all dirt cheap - stake - stocks, and more #dd #buildwealth not going to let a little bear stop the money train
2543 2018-08-28 00:32:49 I own 23 or so stocks that matter. Tesla is one. We also own lots of ETFs and mutual funds. Our risk profile on our portfolios is less than market risk. We have a risk in that we own equities as a % of our portfolios. I’m not a gambler.

2547 2018-08-28 00:30:19 My impression is that Trump's holding does not have a lot of stocks/bonds but more of RE. Although RE could fluctuate, not as much as stocks/bonds wrt to markets AND certainly NOT with his feelings!
2548 2018-08-28 00:30:04 Yes let’s just hope it all gets resolved soon... If it was up to Trump he would kick Canada to the curb I think... At least that’s how it appears imho... It seems we are now left with a take it or leave it situation unfortunately.
2549 2018-08-28 00:29:42 Seeing how SM stocks fly so high when SNSD comeback is announced yet still treat them like shit is disgusting

2553 2018-08-28 00:28:14 He’s trying to back up his Dads contention that if  (when) he goes down we will “all be poorer”. Even if that were true, which it’s not, 54% of Americans own stocks. Of those, the top 10% own $969k avg. Bottom half own less than$54k avg.
2554 2018-08-28 00:28:14 @Jom112 weed stocks man. Weed stocks. 

That is all.
2555 2018-08-28 00:28:09 All of this fluff against Trump is going to mean not a thing.He will win in 2020 as long as all the millionaires in Congress are happy with the soaring stocks and their tax breaks.They are ALL Hypocrites-do you remember in 2008 when the Dems called McCain a racist & a womanizer?
2556 2018-08-28 00:27:33 Why didn't they stop Obama from making bump stocks legal
2557 2018-08-28 00:26:19 Did you buy your SC-Johnson Wax and Kleenex stocks yet?
2558 2018-08-28 00:26:17 My bank account and stocks disagree with you.
2559 2018-08-28 00:26:15 Every place near me that stocks magazines is either sold out or doesn't have the new issue of Vouge in yet
2560 2018-08-28 00:25:57 Btc up more than 6000% in usd vs the price when I first learned about it. When was the last 6000% gain in gold or large MK stocks over a 5 year period?
2561 2018-08-28 00:25:50 These things are not so hard to figure out. Why do ppl still support Drump? Because their stocks are going up. 

Why does Drump support Russia? Because of TRULY MASSIVE MONEY flowing into his accounts from the Russian mob, uh political establishment.
2562 2018-08-28 00:25:33 @timothysykes I’ve been following you for about a month & love the tweets & inspiration. I looking to get into Penny Stocks. What platform do most of your students use? What should be my first move as a newbie?
2563 2018-08-28 00:24:11 Hey democrats! Do you really think it would be just your stocks that would loose ground? The entire US economy is currently attached to our President @realDonaldTrump why is freedom of the press more important then an honest press.
2564 2018-08-28 00:23:54 It’s called the stock market and my stocks are up 30% since January 2017. No movement under 8 years of Obama. That’s fact not fake.
2565 2018-08-28 00:23:35 Is it true that theres no stocks for those who pre-ordered Note9 512GB with Smart and Globe? I pre-ordered with them and both are saying that no stocks available.
2566 2018-08-28 00:23:31 What “gun control” are you referring to? Please be specific. 
If it’s background checks or banning bump stocks I hate to tell you that you’re in th minority. 
The majority of Nevadans want that. 
The majority of Americans want that.
2567 2018-08-28 00:22:56 For many of them, it's because their stocks are going up. Simple as that. Notice that was the first tactic Drump used when he commented about impeachment. Your stocks will go down.
2568 2018-08-28 00:20:47 TRUMP EFFECT?  Stocks soar thanks to Trump's trade deal with Mexico. Winning! Winning! Winning!...
2569 2018-08-28 00:20:13 We will be have strange stocks on watch,we do it sometimes easy!sometimes!!!
2570 2018-08-28 00:18:39 Just like the stocks he sold. Irony at its best.

2576 2018-08-28 00:16:50 Blue chip stocks have always been available and bought in a moments notice when we moved into the computer age many many moons ago. Before that they also were available it just took longer to buy. Where do u get this stuff from?
2577 2018-08-28 00:16:07 I worked just with Nasdaq,Canadian and Australian stocks but since 6 months OTC,i know not to trust everything but I love new experiences!i know you working now Nasdaq and other guys work on shorts and longs but we both work on the same level and that’s fun

2581 2018-08-28 00:15:02 They could also be greedy, it seems that some don’t mind what he does as long as their stocks and 401K grow. Doesn’t that make family get-together so much fun?
2582 2018-08-28 00:14:57 MIs Stocks están bien bien lentos mano 
2583 2018-08-28 00:14:49 ok stocks going all time high, now people talking about no trade war risk.
2584 2018-08-28 00:14:48 That’s totally untrue. I am in manhattan and work in the financial sector. Company’s buy and large are not buying back their own stocks some are but they always have. The supply of available shares has nothing to do with the price of the stock going up.
2585 2018-08-28 00:14:04 Even more sophisticated approach is to diversify portfolio across industries, use covariance matrices with optimisation to determine weighting allocation for equity funds and also look at put/call options.

FANG stocks as well are a good buy, NASDAQ hit 8000 today.
2586 2018-08-28 00:14:00 As a full time employee I do get paid above min wadge, I also get stocks, and bounces. I think my future is safe. My wife and kids are well taking care of.
2587 2018-08-28 00:13:33 True true. My account 1/10th yours though and never want to track more than 20 stocks. Googl actually ~15%.
2588 2018-08-28 00:11:00 An interesting comparison would be investing in JM stocks vs US stocks over the same period. The S&P 500 grew 38% in the last 2 years.
2589 2018-08-28 00:08:50 Asia equity markets begin higher across the board as region gets a tailwind from US where stocks rallied and most majors posted fresh record levels after US and Mexico trade deal agreement; ASX 200 (+0.2%), Nikkei 225 (+0.8%), KOSPI (+0.5%)

2593 2018-08-28 00:05:50 She needs to be put in the stocks and pelted with rotten veg, and then tried as a traitor.
2594 2018-08-28 00:05:46 Picking cheap stocks to buy is not a science, it takes a solid understanding of human behaviour and a vision of how the world will change in  the future.

If you don’t have these qualities the stocks you buy are probably cheap for a reason and you’ll never make a buck
2595 2018-08-28 00:03:22 Be the better babyfur. Go full on sophisticated. Talk stocks, coffee brands.
2596 2018-08-28 00:03:05 Typical socialist comments! the stock market is at an all time high just look at Boeing and Catepillar and the FANG stocks record highs I guess you prefer high unemployment and low salaries and high taxes
2597 2018-08-28 00:02:57 Yep. 100% accurate.  It started with smug "charm offensive" lauded by MSM in Cda., what they know about business would fit in the eye of a needle. Invest in US stocks till Trudeau gone. Hope you followed that advice by traders in the know.  Many saw this coming,
