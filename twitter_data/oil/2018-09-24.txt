1 2018-09-24 23:59:26 Yea sorry. Alex’s org is doing a huge push against it (NL is the nexus of the intl trade and investment in Palm Oil) so been over-reading these days.
2 2018-09-24 23:59:19 Shocker. You’re just another biased journalist. And you wonder why only the true believers think you have credibility. You sell snake oil for your leftist party.
3 2018-09-24 23:58:52 Make an oil with the weed and cook ya food using it as a butter. (not too much tho)
4 2018-09-24 23:58:44 Eucalyptus essential oil and cedar

5 2018-09-24 23:58:41 But you need more oil to fry plantain so it doesn’t balance
6 2018-09-24 23:58:37 Such. A. Liar. You would sell out our beautiful coastline in a nanosecond if we let you for oil drilling and more money (or should we say rubles) in your pockets. Start packing. You’re done in November when we hire @HarleyRouda for actual representation in DC #dumpDana

35 2018-09-24 23:56:01 A relatively quiet on Wall St, markets closing a touch down following a public holiday amongst Asia. Crude Oil rose back to $81 for the first time since 14' on OPEC's decision to decerease output. @jpmorgan is saying @realDonaldTrump Iran sanctions could push the price over $90.
36 2018-09-24 23:55:57 about to learn how to change my own oil since all of the men in my life decided to leave me hangin today so pray 4 me pls lmao

39 2018-09-24 23:55:35 Trump wants to put in a puppet, and take Iran's oil. It's not about anything else.  All the rest an excuse he and his band of thieves use.

43 2018-09-24 23:55:07 You also have to look at this point.  Half of Canada is developing its oil and gas resources and half isn’t,  Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI all have bans on there oil and gas industry and they are receiving equalization payments. This is also very unfair.
44 2018-09-24 23:54:57 Igual en el mio no gasto plata porq le echo el gas oil  de los tractores 
45 2018-09-24 23:54:54 Oil prices hit a 4 year high - how’s that gas price working out for you ?
46 2018-09-24 23:54:47 Owners manual shows type and amount of oil, auto parts store tells you exactly which oil filter to use, put the car on ramps, undo any necessary covers, remove the oil bolt and let oil drain, remove oil filter, replace oil filter, put oil bolt back on, fill car with oil.
47 2018-09-24 23:54:03 Those uniforms are slicker than a can of oil!
48 2018-09-24 23:54:02 Just did a quick pan fry of my right middle fingertip in canola oil on medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet so that was fun. 
49 2018-09-24 23:53:44 There’s a whisper of cotton sliding against nylon, the sharp scent of gun oil. “What are you hunting?” 
I try not to flinch at the accusation in his voice and manage one just as icy. “Rabbit. I never hunted a human until I became your partner.” #amwriting #PNR
50 2018-09-24 23:53:43 Stop using Wilmar palm oil. Stop being part of the destruction of our forests, our planet, our environment.
51 2018-09-24 23:53:40 2388 needs an oil sender usually it’s not a hard job but I can’t find it anywhere on the engine block ideas anyone help would be great
52 2018-09-24 23:53:35 To put into context, $7.9 billion could pay for all this:
*Auckland light rail 
*Waterview
*Transmission Gully
*New Dunedin hospital
*KiwiBuild 
*A new Christchurch stadium 
And that is just the mid-point cost to taxpayers of ending oil & gas permits - it could be up to $23.5b!!
53 2018-09-24 23:52:50 I love being a girl I just got a free oil change y todo 
54 2018-09-24 23:52:19 Now why everyone's distracted by Kavanaugh he is deregulating Obama error regulations Obama had a regulation making oil tankers have special brakes that were safer. the walking greedy buffoon Trump cut that protection. & others. & he knows if we knew about it would be yelling
55 2018-09-24 23:52:17 @Dove Drop Wilmar. Drop dirty palm oil. Stop being a part of the destruction of our forests, our planet, our environment.

61 2018-09-24 23:51:15 The best part was when her dumb racist boyfriend got me to use this rub on oil stuff on my bad knee and acted like I was a liar when I said it didn't magically cure the DEGENERATIVE DISEASE LITERALLY PLAGUING MY BODY

65 2018-09-24 23:50:40 the whole thing is a cluster fuck period.  USA is nearing self sufficiency in oil n gas. by the time any of our resources get to any market other than Murica they won’t want it. duh?

77 2018-09-24 23:49:30 OIL FLOWING THRU MY VEINS
78 2018-09-24 23:49:27 You should check the channels of distribution and why when oil was $80 a barrel in 1997, the cost at the bowser was $1.20. You may find the distributor, the tanker owner is making up the difference.

82 2018-09-24 23:49:16 If the government have a good risk strategy for higher oil, and the oil subsidy is within tolerable range. Higher Oil price is nothing to worry about, since this will create higher price for commodities export. If the oil subsidy hike outweigh potential export this will be bad.

92 2018-09-24 23:48:09 LIE!
93 2018-09-24 23:48:06 You can buy it already cubed, to be clear, and it will work fine. But you'll have to brown the cubes in oil, rather than using the easier broiler method.
94 2018-09-24 23:47:28 Buy 12 coconuts,14 kegs of palm wine,7 drums of palm oil....ur gen go work....lol
95 2018-09-24 23:47:09 People know now that joining the military no longer means "defending America" but "dying and killing for big oil and defense contractors to make $$$" 
96 2018-09-24 23:47:09 The place I get my oil changed thinks it will take me until 12/23 to put on 3,000 miles... that’s cute. I bet I hit that by Thanksgiving weekend.
97 2018-09-24 23:47:07 I need somebody to take my car to get an oil change this week I don't have the time.
98 2018-09-24 23:47:04 What is not often mentioned is disruption in the middle east is beneficial to Russian oil exports.
99 2018-09-24 23:47:02 Greedy  lefty sociopaths willing to screw over the constitution & their country for some oil $$. Not to mention Saudi has huge stakes in controlling media  sure helps find some greedy so-called-journalists & their Hollywood- kissing-CEOs to assist w #FakeNews

102 2018-09-24 23:46:06 Jacks mouth dropped open. “My what?”

Rachel stood quickly. 

“Of course,” she said. “And I promise there won’t be any truffle oil involved.”

The three of them shared a smile and Jack continued to wonder what he missed.
103 2018-09-24 23:46:03 So what your math is saying is too get 10% THC (which is the low end of the scale) you would have to consume a 100 mil bottle of these LP's easy bake oven oil at a cost of between $150-$200. What a waste of money, when anyone can buy a 22% dry bud make your own budder & keep 18%
104 2018-09-24 23:45:49 Mika has been an utter disappointment. I wouldn't buy her book if my life depended on it. She's a snake oil salesmen.

106 2018-09-24 23:45:36 Trying to blame this on Dems is like Exxon blaming the town of Valdez, Alaska for getting duck feathers in its oil.
Just stop this BS.

122 2018-09-24 23:42:34 Step 1: Deep clean. Rub sampai jadi ultra fine foam. Avoid touching your skin. Let the foam touching your skin. Use warm water to rinse. Eg: Nivea Pearl White caring whip. 0% alcohol. 
Step 2: apply face oil. Face oil takes care of moisture for healthy skin throughout the day.

127 2018-09-24 23:41:37 Oil is heading back to $100/bbl, and Trump is making everything else more expensive at the same time. I'm sure this will all work out just fine.
128 2018-09-24 23:41:37 The interview with Earwig is definitely probably still possibly coming. It is taking longer because temporal reverse insomnia. If you want to fight me over it I understand, but I fight in the nude, lathered in old, used motor oil.

129 2018-09-24 23:41:32 On my day off: I had wake up at 6am and fill up my tank, go to a training for work, search 3 grocery stores for some dam bagels, briefly come home, go get an oil change, go to my padrinos shop, drop off my nieces gift, and now workout at home

135 2018-09-24 23:40:52 I've spilled oil on myself. On my arms and once a little popped in to the corner of my eye.  Ouch. Fortunately nothing serious.
136 2018-09-24 23:40:51 News flash Trump. America is energy independent. We out produce any middle eastern country in oil production.
137 2018-09-24 23:40:46 It all boils down to how much money the oil companies can make. They prefer profits over safety over the environment and over the American people. Trump is a scumbag who cares only about his pocketbook and not the American people
138 2018-09-24 23:40:46 Better stop tweeting these beautiful pics of AK.  Some of us CA transplants will move in.  Then you'll have crazy traffic, quadruple taxes, a ban on oil pipelines, a huge tax on hunting and fishing, and a light rail between Anchorage and Fairbanks.  How bout some tundra pics?

145 2018-09-24 23:39:57 The national interest is supposed to supercede all of that.  If we are going to continue funding all our social services we absolutely need our own port to get world prices for our oil, not the 50% discount.  Our future depends upon a thriving economy, with private sector jobs.
146 2018-09-24 23:39:56 @RealDonad_Trump oil prices are skyrocketing. If they go up gas will be up there and consumers stop spending which will kill the economy quick. Work on oil prices. Keep them under $50 a barrel and everyone should be happy. No more travel and people startsaving instead of apending

151 2018-09-24 23:39:30 Chuck, how it can it benefit all Canadians if we have to get our Oil in Ontario from the USA and in the Eastern Provinces from Saudi Arabia... let us build more refineries in Alberta so we can use it in the east instead of selling Alberta oil to the far east at great discount..
152 2018-09-24 23:39:17 Damn....
All the oil you must of used for this.
Much respect.

153 2018-09-24 23:39:04 Devil’s advocate, here: what if McConnell’s governing led to more school shootings (by blocking sensible gun reform) or radicalization in the Middle East (by creating political disorder in the region for cheap oil)?

158 2018-09-24 23:38:43 There are a lot of concerns with moving oil, period. I have them myself, when reading about spills, and the pitiful amount the oil companies have to pay.
I'd feel a lot better if those that are affected, are financially protected.
That said, I wish they'd go east.
159 2018-09-24 23:38:12 .@SecPompeo tells @JohnKerry to keep out of #Iran discussion?  #Pompeo is the guy who gave #Kirkuk oil field to #gazprom & #IRGC and allows #Turkey, #Iran and #Russia to murder Kurds in #Afrin.  Also gave #DPRK time & opportunity to build another 25 bombs.  Keep talking John.

195 2018-09-24 23:32:31 Maybe my Twitter shorthand! Anyway MBIE’s model only makes sense if the oil can be sold and burnt. Which means climate disaster. If policies are in place to ensure climate stability, then the oil is worth very little.

214 2018-09-24 23:28:42 Congestion is pretty much the devil. When medication dried out my nose, the pharmacy sold me a sesame oil nasal spray to moisturize things, and while it sounds weird, it worked brilliantly.
215 2018-09-24 23:28:36 My pen is getting low on oil... part of me needs to save $$ & the other part needs to get high. Sigh.

217 2018-09-24 23:28:02 Was it not clear? I had absolutely no trouble understanding.

You can’t have oil drilling in a climate stable world, because that would make it no longer a climate stable world.

At no point did he suggest you should assume some magic world where actions don’t have consequences.
218 2018-09-24 23:27:56 If you haven't stress tested your portfolio for a rapid spike in the $ of oil, I would highly recommend u do so now. The set-up is in place for such a move, good or bad as it may be. This isn't to say it is a certainty, but the balance of probabilities certainly make it possible.

231 2018-09-24 23:25:57 This has been a very late realization for me, but I've come to the conclusion that I've spent too much time saying things like "climate change is a problem, yo"; or "better take this seriously now". In stead, I've started to say "no oil", "no flying", "no driving" and "no meat"
232 2018-09-24 23:25:53 And if you think this ball is ever NOT going to need oil your the one who is short sighted or whatever it was you called me. Good evening troll.

242 2018-09-24 23:24:46 yes its time the oil production must be taken over by international committee these arab nations must be attacked or threatened to stand down. oil must be made a international asset.

263 2018-09-24 23:21:28 -2 deals being renegotiated, becoming more energy independent, increased exports of oil and natural gas, lower taxes, record jobs, reduced numbers on food stamps, etc....looks like he’s destroying our country all right!

265 2018-09-24 23:21:11 Ah, we silly libs stand corrected.  This is just a rule aimed at preventing a rising toll of oil train accidents/explosions, such as the one in the article that killed 47 people.  The OIL INDUSTRY objected, because apparently human life doesn’t hold up in a cost/benefit analysis.
266 2018-09-24 23:20:52 I try so hard to study but always find myself doing the stupidest shit like organizing my essential oil collection
267 2018-09-24 23:20:51 One had me out for 2 days. Wasn't right all week. Shit was made from pure oil, never again.

269 2018-09-24 23:20:40 No. It just wasn't very clear. If I assume a climate stable world, I'd probably allow oil drilling, as what would it matter? It's not going to increase warming, because we assume a climate stable world!

283 2018-09-24 23:18:59 El potencial exportador es más evidente en Oil (commodity), a mediados de los 90s se producían 800.000 bopd, actualmente 500.000! Existe logística para volver a niveles anteriores! (como notarás, a los totales país me refiero y nunca a algún yacimiento en particular)

284 2018-09-24 23:18:58 hi infodump/PSA thread on candles !

beeswax candles are v cool and also a better alternative to paraffin wax candles, which are what most cheap candles are made of and are also a byproduct of oil refining!

295 2018-09-24 23:16:46 I think I have an oil for everything 
296 2018-09-24 23:16:39 I mean you don't have to like them and I'm not trying to argue to change your mind, but frying frozen chicken like the shit from fast food is all the same, it's the same oil,the same vat and same temp at varying times. So armed is just reaching.

301 2018-09-24 23:15:45 All I did was ask my dad how to tell when I need my oil changed and I got a full 40 minute lesson on what every little frinky dink on my car means PLUS a tour to the damn car shop 
302 2018-09-24 23:15:37 The smallest things make me feel so accomplished for example today I got an oil change, gas and vacuumed my car and I felt unstoppable
303 2018-09-24 23:15:27 It doesn’t take an Econ degree from Wharton to realize tariffs, destabilizing the middle east oil market and throwing rocket fuel tax cuts on an already growing economy will start a vicious cycle of higher prices and inflation.....but turns out having one doesn’t seem to help.

306 2018-09-24 23:14:45 I’ve never had super bad acne, but for awhile I did develop hormonal cystic acne along my jaw & part of my cheeks. The only things that worked for me were cutting gluten & dairy and moisturizing with jojoba oil. Not to say that’ll fix everyone else’s, but diet is big sometimes.
307 2018-09-24 23:14:04 who can do my oil change before 8:30? 
308 2018-09-24 23:13:58 When all those years ago the Arabs pitched their tents on the oil I wonder if anyone alive then envisaged how in just a few short years the elite & politicians in the Western World would grovel and kowtow to them and how much control & influence they would have over us.

314 2018-09-24 23:13:20 The big tech companies need to be broken up. Doc Savage from Savage Nation is absolutely right. What was done to standard oil in the early 20th century needs to be done to these out of control commie tech companies.

320 2018-09-24 23:12:36 I OPENED IT TOO HIGH UP AND IT SPLASHED OIL EVERYWHERE
321 2018-09-24 23:12:28 Omg get an oil change honey. your not gonna have a car if you don’t...
322 2018-09-24 23:12:01 It has capacity for 110,000 liters of diesel. Plus all the plastic and other petrochemical products that are throughout the vessel. The vessel literally could not function without the products derived from the oil they want to ban. Epic cluelessness.

325 2018-09-24 23:11:51 Where's your evidence oil and gas exploration results in climate change? Does your religion ever bother to look at ice core samples which prove that nothing's changed in hundreds of thousands of years? Of course you don't because it's a religion

Because Oil fan has to complain about something trivial.

I mean, if they were REALLY wanting to remove something offensive, they should start with Ryan “Chinstrap” Jesperson, who is probably the single worst aspect of the current in-game experience.

330 2018-09-24 23:11:12 Oil price hike again! 12 pesos since January! 
331 2018-09-24 23:11:03 As in all governments, most politicians overlook the fact that they are spending other peoples’ money; there are also no obvious limits to spending. Always a rush to “develop” regardless of cost in $$ or style - oil boom days are over and prov is broke. New reality
332 2018-09-24 23:10:37 My car is all fixed  Brand new turbo. Synthetic oil change. Interior and exterior wash. 4 brand new tires. I’ll just be in debt for the rest of my life.

336 2018-09-24 23:10:22 If circular debt, oil prices and dollar will jump just because of 30thousand billion inherited who will fill the gap? Lafafis don't have courage to expose all previous wrong doings despite of aiming at kaptan. Kuch sharm aur kuch haya.

346 2018-09-24 23:08:59 1/ I hate implying I'm an expert in anything but I'll share some thoughts.  The lack of a fundamental supply reaction makes crypto easier to manipulate.  If crude oil is manipulated higher, drilling increases to drive price back down partially.
347 2018-09-24 23:08:56 Mach, understand this question is coming from a place of concern:  How much olive oil have you been consuming?
348 2018-09-24 23:08:55 You do know the jobs aren’t going to come to you, right? Can’t find a job? Then move to where the jobs are.  Are you still relying on oil as a driver?  Pretty shortsighted actually.

394 2018-09-24 23:02:44 Because oil prices are on the rise, I think adding higher interest rates is not prudent now. Consumers will be hurt by continually paying higher fuel costs.

429 2018-09-24 22:58:22 The best part is they are pretty much setting up Kavanaugh and Thomas to have no choice but be an anti-liberal wall of "fuck you" on the bench.

432 2018-09-24 22:58:13 Non-renewable energy (i.e. coal, oil, and gas) are also heavily subsidised. And not just directly. The fact that they aren't taxed to compensate the community for the damage they do to the environment is also an effective subsidy, because it lowers their price below true cost.

572 2018-09-24 22:40:01 Dumb question. If they sell a drop for a penny they can make that claim. Holy gave Rouhani an opening to smear Trump. Germany has pulled out several large corporations from Iran, and the collapse of their oil markets will force Iran to renegotiate a substantial nuclear deal.
573 2018-09-24 22:39:50 “JPMorgan cited geopolitical risks that could push the price of oil toward $90 a barrel, including the trade war with China, NAFTA negotiations and particularly the chance of “a major miscalculation from sanctions” against Iran.”
574 2018-09-24 22:39:26 realDonaldTrump There running these gas prices up, it hurts your working class voters. more money in workers pockets means more votes for Pres, Trump. just 20% of this usa  strategic oil reserves would drop the price enough to let people think every thing is good . 100% Trump lol
575 2018-09-24 22:39:20 Whether Winston understands the policy, or clearly enunciates it, is another matter entirely.

Which is neither here nor there, he’s just playing with the media.

Cutting oil & gas consumption is part A. Cutting gas & oil exploration is the first step on that policy pathway.

577 2018-09-24 22:39:06 Trevor in Nigeria, a guys bike was stolen just about the same time a nigerian oil tanker went missing on the sea. So when the guy went to report it at the station, the police told him to scram coz if they couldn't find an oil tanker how could they find a bike with 4ltrs of oil

579 2018-09-24 22:38:57 Canada has far larger oil reserves than the U.S.  

If @JustinTrudeau wasn’t hell bent on sabotaging our resource development, Canada could easily be the largest producer in the world.

595 2018-09-24 22:37:09 Ok, need a poor government, then need an economy based entirely on oil with overpriced commodities supported by the general consumer, then we need the 0.1% to strangle the price of oil, whilst still charging consumers the same, mainly to hurt the Russians, et voila Venezuela.

597 2018-09-24 22:36:48 Wut?

The policy (as announced by Ministers) IS about managing the existential threat.

It’s literally been a @NZGreens topic since 2005, and @pakaraka has done work on climate change & oil use reduction for decades.

We’re dangerously close to not cutting emissions in time.
598 2018-09-24 22:36:46 Blood or engine oil?
599 2018-09-24 22:36:42 I loved it! Funny thing, I was walking around Apponaug, taking pics while waiting for an oil change. I was in most of those video locations the same day it was released.

606 2018-09-24 22:36:00 Let's see. I asked about the mineral oil issue, which I was prepared to be a big issue. I called multiple people who had been skeptical of the drug. Sometimes the results are actually good.
607 2018-09-24 22:35:51 If you redo @MBIEgovtnz modelling with assumption of climate stable world, there is no market for more fossil fuels and cost of ending exploration is close to zero. But @MBIEgovtnz asssume a climate disaster where there is growing market for oil to claim it costs billions
608 2018-09-24 22:35:48 Are there pre-positioned oil spill response equipment? SAR assets available? Proper size rescue & towage available? Who will manage international response effort? Who is in charge? Who is responsible for oversight?
609 2018-09-24 22:35:35 God bless CBD oil.
610 2018-09-24 22:35:02 you can go to youtube and watch recipes from the Island of Crete.  No coconut oil or Canola oil involved.  I don't think coconut oil is bad, but it's just not used in Greek cooking.

613 2018-09-24 22:34:46 According to the Government's own advisors: “Net impact on global emissions is uncertain but more likely to be negative than positive...any reduction in domestic oil and gas production will simply be displaced by other, more likely higher emitting, sources overseas.”
614 2018-09-24 22:34:39 Y’all want these foreigns until ur oil change is 100 & it’s 3 bills for one tire 
615 2018-09-24 22:34:19 I had terrible earache at a time when in Ireland, you bought olive oil from a chemist in tiny bottles. My poor mother. Lol. So good for the pain though.
616 2018-09-24 22:34:19 that may be so but some of there decisions like on oil & gas, not funding the dhbs adequately in my mind is detrimental to NZ, they also said they going to reduce immigration but they haven't done it, for a working men's government I don't think they're helping working people.

619 2018-09-24 22:33:59 It's not "our" oil. When you figure that out and that the same multinational corporations own it all you realize they ship it wherever is most profitable. 

The pipeline is scam to save a couple pennies on a barrel. It's a box on an excel spreadsheet

639 2018-09-24 22:31:27 Nobody sees this but conventional producers will be the biggest winners when the dust settles. I talked to an Argentinian oil/gas CEO who told me, they will not chase shale under any circumstances.
640 2018-09-24 22:31:20 spare us the "paid protesters" BS narrative, everyone knows who gets paid when it comes to this awful project: stakeholders in the oil and gas industry. 99.99% of the endless pro-pipeline promoted tweets come from them. you people are the #ecoterrorists plain and simple
641 2018-09-24 22:31:15 What happens when a oil refinery goes down for a couple of hours or a gas truck turns over? Our gas prices miraculously go up 30-60 cents a gallon. Same principle with healthcare.....Affordable Health care was just an excuse to raise prices so people would blame the system.

643 2018-09-24 22:30:56 The TO City Council and City Attorney are consummate professionals who understand the  proper role of municipal government. A 20% increase in crude oil prices  pushed gas prices up  plus the gas tax. We complain about crowded roads, but don't want to pay for improvements.

661 2018-09-24 22:29:08 When @MBIEgovtnz estimate cost of ending new oil exploration at billions, their model assumes catastrophic climate change, as that is the consequence of continuing to expand fossil fuel extraction. In a climate stable world the oil is worth almost nothing.

665 2018-09-24 22:28:43 BTW, I just read a scary-as-hell article in Washington post on methane releases in the artic. We can’t afford to waste resources on things that increase emissions. E.g. every cent of our oil/gas revenues could have gone towards EV subsidies, that would have actually reduced CO2.

701 2018-09-24 22:22:59 Million dollar idea, certain Thai food places should have separate containers holding the sauce or the food should come in those to go bowls. Nobody likes wiping peanut oil out of their seats. #justwhitegirlthings #wtfthaifood #saltyboi
702 2018-09-24 22:22:57 I'm starting to love avocado oil, and thankfully I can order it for less online.

704 2018-09-24 22:22:30 Feeling of a Champion.
705 2018-09-24 22:22:27 something about filling the gas tank, changing the oil and pumping the tires of my car all in one day makes me feel like an adult lol.
706 2018-09-24 22:22:15 +HR+ Warming X mix, removing it from the heat and then adding oil tastes rich. Warming X mix with oil, smells and tastes fried.
707 2018-09-24 22:22:14 An “All of the Above” approach that includes Coal, Oil, Gas, Wind & Solar... No Government Subsidies for any Energy Production Companies... America needs to be Energy Independent... #KeepDrillingTexas

710 2018-09-24 22:22:10 I've never read a single comic book but if I know one thing it's that Venom is a puddle of oil that a wizard slipped on
711 2018-09-24 22:22:08 I've eaten over a pound and a half of local green chiles today (the actual peppers, not mixed with anything but salt and a little olive oil).  I could breathe fire right now. #chileseason #chileharvest #roastinggreenchile #newmexico #lascruces
712 2018-09-24 22:22:05 100++ million in one show that WWE get a year from TV contract for the same amount

Fuck it all if the oil money want Taker wrestle with Shawn again so be it

Any other promotion will sell their family to the devil for that profit
713 2018-09-24 22:21:58 22+billion in revenue from the oil and gas industry keep on believing your mistakes
714 2018-09-24 22:21:52 oil change and tire rotations.... dealership lounges are so.... sad
715 2018-09-24 22:21:48 He’s so greasy he doesn’t need to change the oil in his car!
716 2018-09-24 22:21:22 The oil will still burn, only Canadians will make billions more, and move the product in a safer way
717 2018-09-24 22:21:19 Naturals don't decide it's fall  based on any calendar  we decide it's fall when our coconut oil  turns solid again 
718 2018-09-24 22:21:17 Oil
719 2018-09-24 22:21:03 Cut in hot oil until chicken on gently until cooked through.
720 2018-09-24 22:20:45 He’s using shorthand.

If the world doesn’t stop using oil & gas, emissions will continue to rise.

PEPANZ are the ones being disingenuous, by stating carbon emissions might rise. Incorrect.
We’re going to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
They are sunset industry & they know it
721 2018-09-24 22:20:42 Reading the last CRA book like.... everyone has way too much money. The sympathetic character is a palm oil heiress. Everyone is obsessed with stupid rich people shit. And yet it's fascinating
722 2018-09-24 22:20:27 I had a terribly painful ovarian cyst that ruptured. Felt it coming back like it was going to burst again... I highly recommend getting frankincense and lavender essential oil. 4 drops of each 1-2 times a day on lower back and lower abdomen. I'm like 95% pain free now!

726 2018-09-24 22:19:36 The wankers replying to her tweets by slagging off her husband to her really need to look at themselves.

Again, a situation the manager has poured oil on in the interests of self-preservation.
727 2018-09-24 22:19:28 The existing pipeline has access to every possible market. 

But the oil loaded on tankers from the current pipeline just goes to the US.
And so will any oil in the expanded pipeline. 

The expansion is a scam.
728 2018-09-24 22:19:27 CBD Oil works best for me.
729 2018-09-24 22:19:23 Anyone out there use over-the-counter CBD oil, cream, or edibles? Working on a story, could use your help. Thanks!
730 2018-09-24 22:19:06 What happened to the quality of our MPs? I'm sure we had statesmen and stateswomen once.... not shabby, mendacious snake oil salesmen.

734 2018-09-24 22:18:58 The MBIE report looks unreliable in other ways. It doesn't seem to take account of the potential of existing licences (running out over 30 more years) and it relies on the world just continuing to use more oil and gas. It should not be hard to grasp that this is going to stop.
735 2018-09-24 22:18:54 it's coconut  oil
736 2018-09-24 22:18:51 @realDonaldTrump Mr Pres, you have this within your power get gas prices down what ever it takes before we vote, just 20% will drop the market LOL former Chicago Merc deck holder 1st option C D s for V P  LOL, got your back jack. release the oil we have enough. just do it
737 2018-09-24 22:18:46 CBD oil >
738 2018-09-24 22:18:45 It’s just for Trump to bring in His BOSS Vladimir Putin’s Oil and to have $10.00 a gallon gas prices in America.
739 2018-09-24 22:18:38 Barack Obama is a narcissistic dilettante and spends all is time either being coached for performance or seeking pleasure. He gets his in house instructions by the cabal of witches V.J. , "Michelle" and Olive Oil look alike Susan Rice. Who is the puppet master above it all?

742 2018-09-24 22:17:47 Even if you don’t sympathize for the animals being brutally slaughtered in the dairy industry, you can still, at the very least, care about the planet we live on being exploited and destroyed by the dairy industry more than any other industry including: oil, mining, & automotive
743 2018-09-24 22:17:41 Yes to all of this AND teatree oil is magic for spot treatment!!
744 2018-09-24 22:17:39 I'm anti expanding fossil fuel infrastructure. They have enough. We need to start moving off fossil fuels immediately. 

I could care less what a bunch of crooked oil companies lose on transportation.
745 2018-09-24 22:17:38 Crazy idea: tobacco-scented weed/oil, so if you smoke in public people think you're smoking a regular cigarette

749 2018-09-24 22:16:40 I’ve got it also.  Good orthotic in shoe, ice it when feeling hot and do not use, I respectfully repeat, don’t use, flush the norco.  Few drops of CBD oil under tongue, hourly until pain gone then maintain.  Will NOT make you high, will reduce inflammation! Don’t opiate!
750 2018-09-24 22:16:37 Unilever were last week named by Greenpeace (actual activists) as one of the brands which has failed to honour its' promises to cut deforestation palm oil from its' chain-of-custody. @Unilever. Talking-up activism whilst destroying the planet. #dontlooknow #finalcountdown
751 2018-09-24 22:16:36 There's the sole answer why cannabis oil is so hard to get for cancer patients and others with debilitating illnesses

756 2018-09-24 22:16:23 The deals of the oil sands was a bad deal because it was the oil of the people and I didn't sell my ownership and neither did any other original owner.
757 2018-09-24 22:16:22 Phase out oil and all these wars, weirdo presidents and alliances with dispicable people lose fuel.

760 2018-09-24 22:16:02 As someone who gets bitten by everything I was told by an Italian pharmacist that geranium cream worked & I swear by it. Get the oil and add to plain moisturiser for your body - that’s why geraniums are in apartment windows!

762 2018-09-24 22:15:25 I'm not your research assistant, honey.  The fact you won't verify where you heard that she uses CBD oil not weed speaks volume.  I choose to believe what The Talk said.  I don't know why you want to pick a fight with me but enough is enough.  Game over.
763 2018-09-24 22:15:11 Except coconut oil, that shit keeps my skin on fleek. 
764 2018-09-24 22:15:06 It would be a lovely thing to coat my body in almond oil, to massage, scratch and nibble another body. Where are you?
765 2018-09-24 22:15:00 From Iraq why this is crazy madness behoned  words and completely insaine  to have spent tax payers money and not take a single barrel of oil from Iraq we should have taken their oil and gas of them but we didn't said president trump  so why did we invaded Iraq what was all that
766 2018-09-24 22:14:52 Do u understand most agree that Scotland would be wealthy without uk? Do u understand  you’ll be worse off come brexit? Do u understand it was Scotland’s oil that basically saved debt ridden uk from bankruptcy? Do you understand that uk expenditure is far more than its income?
767 2018-09-24 22:14:46 I am making stew with garlic, onion, olive oil, smoked paprika, red wine, carrots, and eye of round. I don't want to get into a beef over this, but I will steak my reputation on it.

780 2018-09-24 22:13:02 When a government earned $400 billion dollars in 5 years   from oil proceeds, increased debt profile from paltry 5trillion naira to 12 trillion naira without any substantial infrastructures.That government was even
borrowing to pay salaries.
I don't know what to call such as govt
781 2018-09-24 22:12:58 Yes, I did get your recipe. Thank you. I got so many recipes that I couldnt keep up with all of the messages.

We ended up sauteeing the cauliflower with s&p, veggie seasoning & a hint of olive oil. So simple & so delicious.

785 2018-09-24 22:12:33 Olive oil has served us well. I just saw a photo of a relative in Italy in a park at 95 years old.  She's not an isolated case.  I am seeing black swans all over the place.  They eat bread and pasta. The one thing is that they make everything themselves.
786 2018-09-24 22:12:32 What makes oil changes so special???
787 2018-09-24 22:12:31 I was supposed to do my oil change but fell asleep out of nowhere 
788 2018-09-24 22:12:25 Americans are paying more for oil, food and imported items, and farmers have been put on welfare, thanks to Trump.  His trade deals are costing Americans in so many ways.

792 2018-09-24 22:11:52 Luke definitely likes the tuna in oil, and if I could afford it, I would give it to him every day. Wondering if maybe I should get some kitten food for him. That might help him put on some weight.

795 2018-09-24 22:11:31 black ppl so lucky w oil and hair like my hair never gets oily or greasy unless i put too much oil on it and even then it goes away after a couple days ... black privilege
796 2018-09-24 22:11:30 Or the big oil change companies are making burner accounts trying to get people to come in and change their oil more often than they need too
797 2018-09-24 22:11:16 #SpectroOils.   I use Premium Heavy Duty Synthetic 20W50 on my 2017 Fat Boy.   Is this an approved oil by Harley-Davidson?

804 2018-09-24 22:10:10 I'm sure you're doing a great job! CBD oil can help dogs with anxiety-I've had success, and several other people with rescue dogs have also had it work. Littlefoot wouldn't have to be on it forever.
805 2018-09-24 22:10:06 so much oil.... ?

811 2018-09-24 22:09:28 Today in Walmart the auto dept called over the speaker & said someone's oil change was done. A boy from the Amish family I walked past said "must be ours" and cracked up
812 2018-09-24 22:09:28 There’s Sativa oil in my chapstick so yeah I’m the shit
813 2018-09-24 22:09:21 @realDonaldTrump ok Boss here we go, you have to Release some of the strategic oil reserves before the midd terms so that gas prices are low, you can`t count on midd east country`s you have to get the prices down so that money is in our pocket`s we move this, quit with the bull
814 2018-09-24 22:09:17 That’s because we import oil from outside Eu and we refine our own petrol etc
815 2018-09-24 22:09:15 @andiesaizan My wife, Edie, and I are delighted to learn that you are running for Louisiana's sixth district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  We just contributed $25.00 to your campaign.  We must remove Garrett Graves and his BIG OIL/BIG CHEMICAL lobby "sponsors"!
816 2018-09-24 22:09:14 One week they're all complaining that Kiwis can't afford to eat or own homes or clothe their kids and the next they're taxing the hell out of petrol, shutting down exploration for oil and demanding Kiwis adopt expensive energy technologies.

820 2018-09-24 22:08:52 The goddamn gelato at Trader Joe's is not repackaged Talenti. The pistachio is so full of coconut oil that it tastes more like coconut than pistachio. Talenti's has no coconut oil. You are all deluding yourselves.
821 2018-09-24 22:08:25 The numbers about the oil and gas ban are really weird. Who aggregates over multiple-decades, really? This is a bit like claiming NZ Super will cost $1.2 trillion (by 2050). Use an annual figure or GTFO.

823 2018-09-24 22:08:12 President Maduro announced plans to increase #oil exports to #China by 300 Kb/d by August 2019.Two countries will each invest ~USD5 billion to increase crude production&meet the export target. #Venezuela also signed MoUs with China related to drilling 300 wells in Ayacucho region
824 2018-09-24 22:08:07 The real EV scam is that power plants are selling you the SAME ELECTRONS over and over again. Why isn't the #SEC investigating THAT, I ask you?? Probably a plot by Big Oil.

826 2018-09-24 22:07:23 tea tree oil!!!!
827 2018-09-24 22:07:20 @hondaofpasadena, my wife, had a 2:15 PM oil change appointment, just to be shunned by the reps there. We've been coming here for over 15 years, and not once has the service been this poor. 1-hour went by, and she left just to be told that they were 'backed-up.'
828 2018-09-24 22:07:17 Maybe have a tiny bit of food and a peppermint tea! Also if you have lavender oil put some of that on. Hope you get to sleep soon x
829 2018-09-24 22:07:16 Tea tree oil will get rid of it 
830 2018-09-24 22:07:10 Do remember that brunei have a huge oil reserve to compensate logging, we are dependant on our natural resources aka trees to bring in revenue
831 2018-09-24 22:07:04 There is no proof, only speculation, that neem oil poisoning is the cause of CHS. I have spoken with people whose cannabis did not have neem and they still experienced CHS. With Neem poisoning, relief is not found via hot showers the way it is with CHS.
832 2018-09-24 22:06:51 Win Nov canola down A$0.31/t. EU rape up A$1.04/t on currency move only. Canola futures hitting resistance against ongoing trade issues. Support from cold wet weather delaying harvest & support from crude oil & soyoil.
833 2018-09-24 22:06:44 She's a proven liar for the oil industry so I don't really care what she says.

The existing TransMountain pipeline goes to "tidewater". It doesn't get better prices
834 2018-09-24 22:06:36 Is there an essential oil that cures that?
835 2018-09-24 22:06:28 Makes you wish Jamaica had a tax in place to purchase a hedge on crude oil...
836 2018-09-24 22:06:26 I can't stress this enuff,had the COALITION THUGS NOT invaded,pillaged,pilfered, murdered,destabalized,displaced these poor souls,none of this would've happened.
For a.little bit of OIL,2 MILLION MURDERED AND 60 MILLION DISPLACED,FN DESPICABLE AND HEINOUS

839 2018-09-24 22:05:27 The #TrudeauLiberals and the #ScheerConservatives have made it clear that dirty oil tarsands expansion for 50 more years and pipelines are their agenda. Vote for Cda's ENVIRONMENT and our DEMOCRACY in 2019 @CanadianGreens #gpc (where you can) and @NDP #ndp #cdnpoli #bcpoli
840 2018-09-24 22:05:21 #Startup oil company under ten million investment can produce more than seventeen million plus and cost would only go down after time seven to ten million profit is a good investment seeing most businesses invest much to make little hopefully

By evening you eat Fruits again. 
Then with time you continue with a very flexible diet. Not too rigid. 
Eat meals w less oil.
842 2018-09-24 22:05:16 The existing TransMountain pipeline can access other customers. Same with all the rail lines to the coast.

Why don't they get this supposed better price?

Face it, there are no other customers interested in bitumen from AB.

Oil grades have market prices.

844 2018-09-24 22:04:28 .don't forget the solar power industry! Set yourself ahead of the strife and leave oil behind early, you could be innovating and selling to others. 
845 2018-09-24 22:04:16 Subsidy! After making so much with crude oil. Everyone has the right to cast their vote for whom ever they believe in. Let's stop insiting crises. Because when it start you don't have the nerve to finish it. Democracy is free for all. Make your choice should be d order of d day
846 2018-09-24 22:04:09 Best late/lunch dinner: marinated artichoke hearts in olive oil served over freshly made, toasted rosemary focaccia. And a glass of wine. I'm in paradise.
847 2018-09-24 22:03:52 I admit that I fear at some time that it was too much training but I’m just in awe right now. And damn that light work is genius. Do I need to say how jealous I am of the oil assistant who worked on his body? 
848 2018-09-24 22:03:30 $AMRN - It will be YEARS not months for them to reap any profits if this fish oil is approved by the FDA.

851 2018-09-24 22:03:00 Th ruling elites form a monopoly of control over most of us.
 Fewer & fewer people are gaining control over most of us in many fields like: food, seed, money (banks &  foreclosures), pharmaceuticals, energy; oil, coal, & more. They use government & their laws to control us.

860 2018-09-24 22:01:53 To be fair, the percentage of payments towards oil bonds in 4 yrs out of the extra excise duty collected (because of increase in excise duty on fuel prices) shd be calculated & not out of total excise duty collection as the claim is that the duty was hiked to pay for oil bonds
861 2018-09-24 22:01:43 EZ shares -0.6%, US shares -0.4% with bond yields & oil up and reports US Dep AG Rosenstein may leave.
US 10 yr yld +3bp to 3.09%, Ger 10 yr yld +5bp.
Oil +1.8% to $72.1 as OPEC holds supply, gold -0.1%, iron ore +0.7%.
ASX futures -0.1%.
$A 0.7251 as $US index flat.

865 2018-09-24 22:00:57 apparently CBD oil has pm always been legal it's just that the laws are strict on how much THC it can have

874 2018-09-24 22:00:18 I hear this a lot. "Spills are inevitable. It's only a matter of time."

The volume of oil used for this $1.2B loss would be 2.68 times the oil spilt GLOBALLY for all of 2017. We would have to sink SEVERAL tankers to hit that number.
875 2018-09-24 22:00:12 I need some more coconut oil 
876 2018-09-24 22:00:09 @PrakashJavdekar sir there is S.T Depot. Gondia (maharashtra) near my house they are regularly burning tyres, used oil and other plastic waste in open which is generating very toxic smoke within the vicinity causing very serious health problems.
877 2018-09-24 22:00:02 Do they have oil?  Now we need you to focus on nations with oil until our prices lower and stabilize... please focus on oil.
878 2018-09-24 22:00:01 Having a car is all fun until you have to start paying for other things besides gas, like oh look I have a flat tire, oh no my brake light doesn’t work, great it’s time for an oil change... again! 
879 2018-09-24 21:59:54 Girl check your oil while you’re at it if it got that bad
880 2018-09-24 21:59:52 The situation also not helped by all the different religions that want to turn on each other because they dont believe in each others beliefs.  Shia, Sunni and Kurds in particular a rather horrendous situation has been created.  Western countries are only interested in the oil.
881 2018-09-24 21:59:50 My co-workers man pulled up to the job to give her an oil change while she was working...did that shit RIGHT IN THE PARKING LOT 
882 2018-09-24 21:59:44 When will you people get this, THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATE ARE ALL THIS SAME! You keep expecting them to be better the the other!  They both only represent Special Interest Groups, ie. Big Pharma, Oil, Banker, Land Developer, Etc, who give them BIG $$$. Not us! Wake up people!

885 2018-09-24 21:59:13 Compare the palm oil industry. With the grass fed beef industry in NZ. Good old reforesting NZ.
886 2018-09-24 21:59:12 Snake oil salesman.  Break it - then claim you fix it with something shittier
887 2018-09-24 21:59:10 things $25 could buy me:
an oil change (that i need desperately)
windshield wipers (that i also need desperately)
half a tank of gas
probably a brake job

what i chose to spend $25 on:
getting a 5 dollar famous bowl meal 5 days a week
888 2018-09-24 21:58:58 Oh yes yes yes my darling please please please allow me to oil those babies up an titty fuck em 
889 2018-09-24 21:58:58 ICE saw a Brent American options record today with a total of 272,227 lots executed. This breaks the old options volume record of 219,650 lots on Oct 28, 2015. 

Brent crude recently topped $81 a barrel, its highest level since 2014, amid a tightening oil market.

894 2018-09-24 21:57:44 But I paid $130 for three oil changes. The last two basically free
895 2018-09-24 21:57:35 if you're interested in some of the benefits from cbd oil, let us know! We'd love to answer any questions
896 2018-09-24 21:57:29 so you believe that the poorest counties are now the wealthiest hmm, hold did that happen? magic no its oil. I hold an engineering degree and a biology degree. maybe you need not tell others to go to school and look at the facts oil is driving Ohio's recovery not Anything Jk did
897 2018-09-24 21:57:25 man i went to get an oil change not to hear that I need a damn tire
898 2018-09-24 21:57:23 Trump hasnt been to his home in #TrumpTower since Jan 2017. Just after he knows both #Cohen & #Manafort flipped he goes home for 1st time.

906 2018-09-24 21:55:59 Actual sentence from a cookbook I’m reading right now:  “Hot oil must be respected, but do not be too afraid of it because being tense while cooking could increase the risk of an accident.” I’ve never worried about my emotional state while frying before. Or respecting the oil

910 2018-09-24 21:55:46 Anyone who took the shale gas revolution and dismissed its impact on oil were the biggest culprits in all of this!
911 2018-09-24 21:55:45 Put a hot oil treatment in my hair. Man is it feeling mightyyyy fine
912 2018-09-24 21:55:28 You have managed to turn the counter argument made 4 years ago entirely on its head. Oil production and profits in UK waters are declining, prices fluctuate significantly. That is the source of unpredictability.
913 2018-09-24 21:55:26 girl u know idk about black ppl hair except what you have taught me but im currently obsessed with hair masks and argan oil
914 2018-09-24 21:55:24 Before you give all the land away to big oil.

923 2018-09-24 21:54:19 that is awesome! we love positive stories from making the switch to cbd oil.

932 2018-09-24 21:52:35 Well we waited and waited for new Sporn, and Oh My Dad was it worth it (although not keen on the ‘oily oil with more oil’ look, but not gonna complain either). Love how Netflix have commented on it with just one word “Wowwwwwwww”.
933 2018-09-24 21:52:30 I worked and lived there end 80's.

937 2018-09-24 21:52:03 These foolish kids have swallowed the snake oil peddled by the Trump haters.  Idiots.  They have no idea of what absurd actions they are taking.  Then they’re applauded by equally ignorant numbskulls.

954 2018-09-24 21:49:20 Awww thanks love!! First off I’m Italian and Armenian so I grow hair fast! Hahah but other than that I take collagen peptides (vital proteins is great but I use some cheap off brand) and do an Apple Cider Vinegar wash once a week and a little bit of coconut oil after I rinse :)

962 2018-09-24 21:48:52 It’s not irrelevant- its reported scarcity 4 years ago was used to prove some myth of poverty - Scots are JUST as good at running an economy as any other country - with oil they are even better at dealing with the unpredictables

969 2018-09-24 21:47:45 You're a real cowgirl then.  My cousin, Lynn, was to; up in Calgary and in TX - her daddy was an oil man.  She rode barrel horses.  / We were gentle w/the ponies; they were pretty tame.  Maybe that's why Grandpa didn't want us riding them.  We walked them around & groomed them.
970 2018-09-24 21:47:23 Nowadays, each time I talk to my dad he always lets me know how proud he is of me. I like that feeling.

980 2018-09-24 21:46:07 Do you have any idea how many oil cars would need new brakes? Me neither, but the first time one crashes and kills someone, it won’t be trump’s fault. It’ll be on the GOP for its failure to govern.
981 2018-09-24 21:46:07 So why were you celebrating that oil was at a 4 year high if its very existence, whatever the value, is utterly irrelevant to Scotland's future?

987 2018-09-24 21:44:53 Oil and gas are part of the energy mix and, simultaneously, we need to encourage the uptake of alternative sources of energy such as biofuel and biogas, in order to achieve our climate ambitions - @PPouyanne, CEO of @Total #OGCI18 #ClimateWeekNYC
988 2018-09-24 21:44:38 All wrong. THC oil stops it. All dementing conditions. In combination with this new drug if you have to. But the oil stops it from further progress. Studies in the states and Israel prove it. Wake up all of us. It's time. No more diabetes as well. And so many more.

990 2018-09-24 21:44:34 Ha ha ... well it’s actually more akin to Ineos who create end products from the oil drilled by someone else just in VRS case the base material is graphite mined by a real miner ... they are just turning it into Graphene and Graphene enhanced end products!
991 2018-09-24 21:44:26 Good for checking the oil in my car!
992 2018-09-24 21:44:24 I again thank you @dionnesearcey for your reporting on this issue which has destroyed lives n property. A deliberate move by France n FrenchCameroun under Paul Biya, bc of the oil wealth if this region. Thanks very much.

Do you also know just how many billions the City of London contributes to the UK coffers? It dwarfs oil. 

The money we raise doesn’t match the money we spend. That’s why we get £13 billion to help.

It’s impressive, no matter your politics.

1018 2018-09-24 21:41:42 In combination with THC oil at least! Come on. Study's in the states and Israel show it stops Alzh in it's tracks itself. Time for all to wake up. Our suffering conditions is political, and we know it, but say and do nothing, complicit to political fear.
1019 2018-09-24 21:40:49 Jim, I'm being provocative coz Albertans have been belly-aching for years about Canada free-riding off oil sands developments, while you keep yourselves tax-free and pillage your Heritage Fund.

1033 2018-09-24 21:39:37 Actually the trade schools advocated beer to help process oil base fumes out of the liver. That's why you can smell oil based chems people work with in their breath after drinking beer.The alternative was cod liver oil and you burp the fumes out when it's processed from the liver
1034 2018-09-24 21:39:37 hahahah the oil change one is me too 
1035 2018-09-24 21:39:35 I asked my mom if I was annoying and she said “the squeaky wheel gets the oil.”
So yes.

1037 2018-09-24 21:39:01 £13b! Our oil revenues are very least half of that & that’s with england taking its whack.And we’d have invested our oil revenues in sovereign wealth fund.Our exports were £29 billion etc.Once brexit is here, uk will have far higher taxes, higher pension age, less jobs, lower pay
1038 2018-09-24 21:38:42 What if Venezuela refined it's own oil and included Palestine in an alliance of socialist states

1040 2018-09-24 21:38:30 If you are allergic to peanuts does your neighbour in another unit have to stop eating peanuts?  How about frying with peanut oil?  For the article above my solution is to buy each person (smoker and allergic) a first-rate air-filter for their respective units.

1058 2018-09-24 21:35:16 Huh?  I make money from CO2 capture companies.  But this technology is a waste of money, as CO2 is not a hazard to people or planet. 

And the big oil companies, including Exxon, developed and pushed CO2 capture tech more than any others they make money either way.  Why not?

1065 2018-09-24 21:34:57 He’s the worst. Beholden to gas and oil to the point he wouldn’t even put the PA budget up for a vote because it was going to pass and there was a tax on them. Get the old white guys out and put in a woman. It’s time.
1066 2018-09-24 21:34:57 Great stuff Stu. Evidence based decisions.
What about oil & gas?
Part time evidence based (when it suits) but not for real jobs & real revenue.
What about the other 124 countries who have signed the war on drugs?
What about ignoring the US Ambassador plea?

1074 2018-09-24 21:34:24 With oil price now on a four year high at $81, I hope the federal government would stop blaming past government and the needful as they too are benefitting from oil windfall.
1075 2018-09-24 21:34:21 Privatize the profit, make public the expense.  Millions die from coal and oil pollution.
1076 2018-09-24 21:34:13 Omg I just went home Friday to get my oil changed 
1077 2018-09-24 21:34:09 Ending foreign funded interference would be one way to slow relentless big oil lobbying...
1078 2018-09-24 21:34:00 You guys should tweet videos of faucets burning, your lawyers stealing the mineral rights from land owners, the damage you to those people’s land, footage of the oil spills that happen daily from various pipelines, diesel trucks “rolling coal”, text scrolling “FUCK MOTHER EARTH”.
1079 2018-09-24 21:33:58 What a laugh! You hipocrite! We buy their oil instead of our own and they still own our wheat board. Real easy to talk a big game but when it comes to backing this up you fall short and continue purchasing oil from a country that wont let women drive or vote.

1082 2018-09-24 21:33:15 OIL.... OILAAAAA
1083 2018-09-24 21:33:11 Both sides can indeed be argued. To me it depends on the war chest e.g. US shale producers vs. Saudis during the 2015 oil slump.
1084 2018-09-24 21:33:08 We have been living with unequal US sanctions for years. Iran's oil sales will never stop. This is America's credibility among the countries of the world that is coming to an end
1085 2018-09-24 21:33:03 Hi Daz. We're all good here. Slowly getting our house sorted. New ceilings are in now. We've had logs delivered for the wood stove and oil is being delivered tomorrow. So we're getting ready for winter!! I've no new Mbm news, Dean is my source, but he's on compassionate leave...
1086 2018-09-24 21:32:59 I don’t feel like the Clark Kent side was weak and confusing, considering it’s a origin story.
Too much focus on epic moments and cool shots, that didn’t really mean much. (E.g. oil rig scene)
The pacing and tone felt very inconsistent, especially for a superman movie

1088 2018-09-24 21:32:49 That is a little like saying "Why should the government of Saudi Arabia make money off of oil?" The US government has the most potential of any entity in the world for making a lot of money off of financial intermediation.
1089 2018-09-24 21:32:45 Diffusing peppermint oil, ginger tea, honey and garlic on a spoon (nasty but helps)

1094 2018-09-24 21:32:04 Depending on the oil in question, it might be made from the stems, leaves, roots, or bark of a plant. In cases like lavender and chamomile, the oils might even be developed from blossoms or flowers. Lemon and orange essential oils come from the rind of the fruit.

1098 2018-09-24 21:31:53 The point of contention is not the value of ceasing further oil exploration but rather how you manage the transition. Public support will fall if these decisions are not managed correctly. There is no control on resource supply.

They capture energy from Th environment, like Th aether or cosmic rays. 
They don’t consume oil, gas, coal or any tangible product.

1118 2018-09-24 21:30:01 I worry more about Peak Fish than Peak Oil because we're less likely to find more fish hidden under the ground somewhere
1119 2018-09-24 21:29:53 I put some vetiver oil in my diffuser and after about 20-30 mins I noticed that my nose was super itchy & I have the sniffles. I’m guessing it’s some sort of allergy. I use Saje brand oils usually, but I bought this off Amazon. I guess I should be sticking to my expensive blends!
1120 2018-09-24 21:29:48 Can you rub coconut oil onto my muscles and pumped bulge in my posing pouch
1121 2018-09-24 21:29:40 Tried packing for my hols tomorrow but I got as far as bikinis and facial oil before admitting defeat and sending myself to bed
1122 2018-09-24 21:29:39 Many of my fellow Scots who voted No have already changed to Yes. Are you saying that being told the only way to stay in the EU was to vote no. That pensioners would lose their pensions with a yes vote. That the oil was running out and only had 20 years left. The Vow. All lies
1123 2018-09-24 21:29:33 I can actually taste/smell it just by looking @castor-oil picture....yoh . 20 years later and it still torments me...
1124 2018-09-24 21:29:24 Spike, Crash
Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Bank of America Corp.,  said in a note to clients on Monday that signals from OPEC mean "the  likelihood of an oil spike and crash scenario akin to the one observed  in 2008 has increased."

1126 2018-09-24 21:29:14 I'd love to get a hold of the secret manual/link, which dictates how human @Tesla bots are instructed to handle criticism.  They always leave aggrieved $TSLA customers alone, while redirecting a "you love oil" slingshot, even at green energy supporters, who know Elon is a fraud.
1127 2018-09-24 21:29:12 NL's economy died with the signing of Muskrat Falls & the spending of $20 billion in oil revenue.  Also, what do you know about the contracted firm to make you say they are "Liberal Friends"? Just an assumption?
1128 2018-09-24 21:28:55 idk I would’ve liked to have added more detail but whatevss. I felt like I would’ve had to start all over and I didn’t want to. Lol but for my first oil painting is decent enough 
1129 2018-09-24 21:28:44 Just changed my own oil for the first time. You know, since I’m a dad now.
1130 2018-09-24 21:28:40 I’ve seen enough of these hateful Democrats and their evil ways.  Makes me sick!

Oil good for Greenpeace boats.
Gas good for Rainbow Warrior.

Maybe finding the white whale will help in finding more oil & gas.

1135 2018-09-24 21:28:20 Environmental cancer is a made up name without a clear definition. It would include diet, smoking, drug use, alcohol use, viruses etc. None of which have anything to with drilling for oil. You still haven't clarified how pumping oil out of the ground causes cancer. It didn't mine
1136 2018-09-24 21:28:16 white converse are all ruined now because my dad spilt oil in the garage and didn’t tell me. love that. good thing i can get a new pair

1141 2018-09-24 21:27:07 Not impressed. Why do we keep promoting oil sands???
1142 2018-09-24 21:27:04 jfc I can’t believe I couldn’t figure out the title of oil spill
1143 2018-09-24 21:27:00 Importing oil is idiotic. Build more refineries and pipelienes and stop importing oil.
1144 2018-09-24 21:26:45 It’s all rolled in together, fwiw.

No new oil permits is just weaning the industry off it’s addiction to oil profits.

Winston, otoh, is just being Winston, playing the media with mischief to see how badly they can jump to wrong conclusions.

1147 2018-09-24 21:26:18 Yeah?
Can I have some of that anointing oil, wanna smother it on my car to turn it into a Lamborghini.
1148 2018-09-24 21:26:11 One thing that you, and many others need to get through your heads, is the people who have lead in this industry for decades aren't sitting here made of money. 
Look at how most of the LPs were formed. 
Mining corps, Oil corps. 
Think I've got $16bill in my pillowcase, hold on...
1149 2018-09-24 21:26:06 Telling my dad about the oil and gas industry just made me appreciate him even more. S/O to the parents working so hard so their kids could get the opportunities they probably didn’t get.
1150 2018-09-24 21:26:04 I think shit like this is only going to show what Labour REALLY are, which is as far as I'm concerned a bunch of snake oil salesmen.

1158 2018-09-24 21:24:56 What’s the point of making an appointment for an oil change if it’s still going to take almost  two hours or more?
1159 2018-09-24 21:24:55 Don't do it. Don't give scammers money... #scamalert
1160 2018-09-24 21:24:37 The #oil #industry #I started is more profitable than the #Arab oil industry at 17 million per #barrel and is beneficial to humans for health and makes no pollution or negative side effects #Bnn make me laugh
1161 2018-09-24 21:24:29 2 hours for an oil change. This is stupid.
1162 2018-09-24 21:24:16 It need minor things like oil change and brakes. Axle need replaced and the mileage
1163 2018-09-24 21:24:09 @bitcoin_oil looks like just another scam, done by old scammers....
1164 2018-09-24 21:24:03 replace soybean oil with cannabis oil  just as god intended

1169 2018-09-24 21:23:19 Donald Duke gave an instance of when he wanted to bring a Malaysian firm to Cross Rivers state to invest in oil palm plantation but they were sceptical and sighted the low productivity level of Nigerians (farmers) as a major obstacle.
1170 2018-09-24 21:23:14 when i need to take my car for an oil change is when i wish i had a mans to make him take it lmfao , i HATE being there so uncomfortable
1171 2018-09-24 21:23:14 Thina abanye we drizzle oil ufake kuoven- crunchy, served as a salad 
1172 2018-09-24 21:22:55 Let’s see, rising oil, rising interest rates, tariffs = bye bye economy.
1173 2018-09-24 21:22:54 agree, #MXO is way too cheap for oil producer imho.
1174 2018-09-24 21:22:48 Ban soybean oil and its production
1175 2018-09-24 21:22:42 If the elected government of Iran was never regime changed then Iran would have been a different country. Standard oil greed created the mess

1178 2018-09-24 21:22:17 @wendyzuk hello Wendy I just listened to your essential oil episode, it was great. I was wondering if there could be a follow-up about the benefits of topical use, specifically in your hair?
1179 2018-09-24 21:22:09 The 3rd RIDICULOUS assertion you made is that an independence movement, (which has existed WAY before the SNP were invented and will exist as long as we are in the sentimental hogwash of an empire takeover by elite hierarchy). Is something that needs oil to be considered. Mad
1180 2018-09-24 21:22:06 Making fries for dinner and stuck the whole tip of my finger in the oil! OUCH! SOB!
1181 2018-09-24 21:22:04 Society pays far more costs for our addiction to fossil fuels. Billions in public health expenditures for air pollution. Billions in government subsidies to oil companies. Billions in spending on relief for climate-caused disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. etc. etc. etc.

1184 2018-09-24 21:21:46 @realDonaldTrump Oil prices increasing at strange time gee I wonder what Deep State and Dem resistance is helping create this attempt to make you look bad. As I've stated before Mr. Berry of Quaker State Oil a close friend always stated $ 20.00 a barrel was good profit. Why high?
1185 2018-09-24 21:21:41 Health, wrote to you and, of course, why not? That's question 1. I wouldn't expect that meeting now with Bill 20, the Oil and Gas 4/5

1194 2018-09-24 21:20:59 Heres some helpful hints to help u sis, green tea, honey, ginseng, coconut oil, nature. As well, try to decrease salt & sugar intake, stay away from diet soda & fake sweeteners.  Eat more fish and poultry, less or 0 pork.. not everything in order,I'll explain later, it does help
1195 2018-09-24 21:20:55 I was greedy back then. I was in the oil business. And Mitt had stake in our company. I was making a little over 100K/yr and I wanted to see 160k. Obama wanted to slow the oil boom. We were reckless. Ruined those ppls' land and water to go faster. Ppl like us needed regulation

1207 2018-09-24 21:19:22 Makes perfect sense, it’s cause Obama. That’s literally it. Enjoy your oil spills and whatever fresh hell this causes.
1208 2018-09-24 21:19:08 I’d probably fall asleep and drown. Turned the oil off now and tucked up in bed

1210 2018-09-24 21:19:03 Just another GOP snake oil salesman relying on people's ignorance hoping they won't actually research the truth about his bullshit ad and find out his actual position is to end pre-existing coverage and repeal Medicare expansion.

1216 2018-09-24 21:18:02 remove the money that the military war complex creates from politics. 

Stop fighting for oil.  Invest in alternative energy sources.  Invest money to help stabilize the economies of other countries, instead of causing chaos to go to war for profit.

1218 2018-09-24 21:17:58 I just poured a little bit of olive oil in my dogs food and he wouldn’t eat it but when I throw in some animal fat he almost comes off the ground his tail is wagging so fast. What does that tell you.
1219 2018-09-24 21:17:42 CBD oil?
1220 2018-09-24 21:17:40 Anyone else dipping themselves in a vat of coconut oil before they go to bed?
1221 2018-09-24 21:17:37 A way of life that unfortunately has a stigma attached to it. From Snake Oil sales, Double Glazing now PPI. But there is a right and wrong way. Tonight we started that discussion.
1222 2018-09-24 21:17:37 @WMJShow Coconut oil! You can use it for almost everything for your baby girl. Put it on her hair even when she’s very young, you can use it on her skin, On her bottom, if she has dry patches you can use it on that! Coconut oil!

1227 2018-09-24 21:17:03 that's plain stupid, and you know it. We have rapidly developing energy systems and production, like solar, hydro, wind etc. We don't need oil and gas exploration, even now, not in 30 years time. No one is stopping current production.
1228 2018-09-24 21:16:54 I got a oil chamge at 5 and im getting drunk off of wine so it wont be as bad waiting for it.

1233 2018-09-24 21:16:36 >  Most of the denier videos are from the oil companies.

Could you provide an example?
1234 2018-09-24 21:16:33 Even solar on the world trade is now less than a barrel of oil for equivalent energy output and the more it is produced more it depreciates where as oil is the opposite. Wind energy cost is also depreciating stop saying it cant be done when clearly it can.
1235 2018-09-24 21:16:29 Grill it. Confit it and make it into rillettes. Slow cook in olive oil and use shredded in salads like good canned salmon or tuna. Make burgers.

1238 2018-09-24 21:16:04 Colombia Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla told lawmakers that the government is studying Mexico-style oil hedging. Oil price forecast of $67 in the 2019 budget seems too low, he said.
1239 2018-09-24 21:15:57 Giving up on farming Wales. Cranes coming up and I want to go into that with max(ish) oil #azurlane
1240 2018-09-24 21:15:55 India has a crazy growing demand for oil so makes sense to explore that market.
1241 2018-09-24 21:15:54 How about PEPANZ coming to an understanding of ‘global oil use must reduce, or the human species (along with all other fauna) with cease to exist’?

B/c that’s what we risk. Biodiversity is already reducing at the highest rate ever recorded. Humans are next.

Genocidal oil corps.
1242 2018-09-24 21:15:50 Great demo last Saturday from Bianca and Maurice Jackson of M & B Catering.  Their poached pear salad using our #Hojiblanca olive oil and #CranberryPearBalsamic was mighty tasty!

1252 2018-09-24 21:13:52 I guess I’ll go be productive and get a oil change
1253 2018-09-24 21:13:35 Try to oil their engines and see if they start generating power before you commit fully. Don't get played.

1255 2018-09-24 21:13:19 @ManCity They got battered by Lyon,
In an empty ground,
They couldn't sell it out,
Not even for a pound,
They got into the quarters,
Got beaten 5-1,
All that oil money,
Yet in Europe they won none

1256 2018-09-24 21:13:17 @theJagmeetSingh @NDP so investors want their $$ flowing w. the oil - we should demand this pipeline stay in Alberta borders - use 'measurable' vehicles (trucks) to haul (saves industry too) let AB build refineries in own province vs invading othrs- keep oil ships out at sea

1258 2018-09-24 21:12:51 Prepared with that stale lemon-pepper Product yes they are. Using lemon " zest " and datil pepper "oil "with a mixture of black-red-white- green fresh ground peppercorns I think you will find a world of difference in the taste.
1259 2018-09-24 21:12:47 Brent oil briefly over $81 today, the ruble up - less than 66/$1 dollar. OPEC+ showed no interest yesterday in increasing production at yesterday's meeting, seemed happy with things the way they are. Predictions price could hit $100 by early 2019... No one heeding Trump's tweets.
1260 2018-09-24 21:12:43 No blood for oil is what you scream at the slaughter, but what about blood for air and blood for water? That's sorta the starter of what the fuck it is, immortal tech, ill bill tell em what the fuck it is

1280 2018-09-24 21:10:04 There is an article called 'newton and the fudge factor' so it is nothing new, but with climate, the deniars are mostly paid shills of the oil industry, fake scientists and so on.

1281 2018-09-24 21:10:03 my parents had a Subaru I think it was a forester and they said the maintenance costs is outstanding the parts are super expensive and it has to have oil changes really often because they literaly burn the oil.
1282 2018-09-24 21:09:42 Last night my engine light turned on when I got too the Burbank ikea. Just thought it was just normal engine oil type shit.

1284 2018-09-24 21:09:31 Socolist democracy is what the Democrats u accuse of socialism want, yet u compare them to the failed version which was based on the ussr, yet was corrupted by greed for their oil
1285 2018-09-24 21:09:01 I don't deny climate change but I wish I could deny that Canada sells our oil to the US for $35/barrel and the US sells their oil for $70/barrel to India and China.
1286 2018-09-24 21:09:00 Like "peek oil" "peek hypocrisy" is a myth.  Whomever you think has demonstrated their peek hypocrisy will work diligently to find greater sources of hypocrisy.
1287 2018-09-24 21:08:51 Oh no , more oil found , we’ll be even poorer now 
1288 2018-09-24 21:08:45 America spend over 400billion on their military while Russia, what every major media news will make you believe is the greatest threat to America, only spends 70billion. What war in the last 20 years hasn't been a fake war for oil or regiem change.
1289 2018-09-24 21:08:40 In 2016 #Peru generated 10.8% of its 48.3TWh from #renewables sources. Hydro accounted for 39.8%, natural gas for 46.4% and coal, oil and diesel for the rest. To promote renewables Peru offers priority dispatch & 20% accelerated depreciation for renewables projects. #Cleanenergy

1292 2018-09-24 21:08:34 bLIAR reneged on manifesto pledge for referendum as leave vote at 75%. When people voted leave he wants to sabotage democracy.  Eutopia have only won 1 referendum out of 11! Let's make it 12 but include on the ballot Tony in jail for war crimes. Saddam only wanted Euro/oil matrix
1293 2018-09-24 21:08:29 Again.. sorry tae complain but Norway has £1,000,000,000,000 (£1 Trillion) Oil Investment Fund & neither the Tories (with or withoot Lib-Dem) or Labour UK Westminster Governments ever even thought to start one for UK (let alone for Scotland). Sack the lot of ‘em for incompetence!
1294 2018-09-24 21:08:21 How many thousands of liters of crude oil are you bringing on board to fuel the old chugger.
1295 2018-09-24 21:08:19 I Did the castor oil treatment last night and I definitely noticed a difference right away my waves have more texture and my hair is super soft can’t wait to see the outcome in 2-3 months fingers crossed for fuller/thicker hair 
1296 2018-09-24 21:08:18 $CEI Last time it  ran to $1.70, this time after it’s debt free and oil spiking , it’ll run to over $3 $$$$
1297 2018-09-24 21:08:03 I love watching the oil industry grow knowing I was one of the first producers in Canada and I am happy not to be in it now with all the greed and selfishness and people acting big to know as much as I have forgotten
1298 2018-09-24 21:07:50 Really?  Just take your CBD tincture from Medicinal Essentials.  You don't need cheese sauce to deliver it.  How much of the oil is stuck on the pan instead of in your body?

1301 2018-09-24 21:07:21 You can see with $FDX for example what higher wages, higher Oil and squeezed profits are going to do to companies. Many will start to feel it in Q4 and Q1 into 2019. This is the beginning and $FDX is a big Hint to what’s coming if the Fed stays Hawkish. Dec Rate + now in ? Imo

1305 2018-09-24 21:06:30 ulta lip oil!
1306 2018-09-24 21:06:30 And on Agriculture, add on if the country is making excess funds and paying down dept life gets better for ALL CANADIANS! If Oil pushes 100$ a barrel like expected you cannot imagine the loss Canada will be hit with. Everyone believes in reducing emissions but seriously
1307 2018-09-24 21:06:29 Most of the denier videos are from the oil companies.  Now they are going to get sued like big tobacco.
drkstrong is the you tube creator I meant to mention.
1308 2018-09-24 21:06:21 Putler stole $200B from RuSSians. Russia has a primitive economy of oil, minerals, caviar and weapons. They make nothing the world wants. All of the brains are in Ukraine. It’s a rust-bucket, crumbling, miserable country. Rise up!!!
1309 2018-09-24 21:06:18 Not a reasonable comment. Automation has been coming for years in all industries. You'll also find that most discussions widely acknowledge many of the jobs of the last oil boom are never coming back. Your zero-sum comment is typical of the anti-oil, Leap Manifesto crazies.
1310 2018-09-24 21:06:17 I need to learn how to change a tire, do a jump start, check my oil, all of that like ASAP!
1311 2018-09-24 21:05:56 Dear General Kelly, if you really want to serve America you’ll stop babysitting this snake oil salesman and expose him, in a real way, for the fraud and pig that he is. Or, you can throw away a distinguished career for a reality TV has-been #ResignNow #NotMyPresident
1312 2018-09-24 21:05:53 List is VERY long with those ‘fans’ & their hypocrisy bs. When TM/PC brot playoffs to Edm they were heroes but very next yr the hypocrisy heroes want them both fired.Has PC made errors,of course,name a GM who hasn’t? He’s done a gr8 job fixing YRS of Oil being run in2 the ground!
1313 2018-09-24 21:05:51 I want to be paid lots of money by targeting the people who do this survey with a snake oil salesman job. Any hope?
1314 2018-09-24 21:05:44 oil price is went upto $73 that's why all oil stocks up. If tomorrow oil price goes down in the morning, they all will come down crashing
1315 2018-09-24 21:05:40 Yesterday I randomly encountered furries while grocery shopping, and today while getting an oil change one of the mechanics comes up and says “How was WFS?” 

Conclusion: WE ARE SLOWLY TAKING OVER THE WORLD
1316 2018-09-24 21:05:39 Dropped the $1100 for my oil leak and now $600 on my mf alternator and battery, LOL FREAK MY LIFE
1317 2018-09-24 21:05:37 Ah, you definitely haven't played the Porvenir Oil Fields section yet, then. That part of the game was HOT. Let me know when you reach it.
1318 2018-09-24 21:05:35 Yeah I guess stress plays a big part too but I try so hard not to stress. I massage oil in my hair. Like warm oil, I don’t know if that’s any good? Can’t put egg in my hair because no one brings egg in the house.
1319 2018-09-24 21:05:29 No problem.  When you go to war for OIL again, we'll watch it on tv.
1320 2018-09-24 21:05:28 I think @altacainart is probably right. You could be extra careful and do an under painting in acrylic, use a clear gesso on top, then oil ‘er up.  Good luck!
1321 2018-09-24 21:05:21 i don’t do much to my face. occasionally i oil cleanse but mainly i just wash my face with a clean cloth & warm water and then rinse finally with cold water. what has it done? my face has been flourishing. i don’t even use much of anything
1322 2018-09-24 21:05:14 Watching a dude about my size try to move a 55 gallon barrel of heating oil is uh... pretty funny.
1323 2018-09-24 21:04:59 And since when do oil changes on Chevys cost $70-$90 @Valvoline ? Y’all tried to get over because I’m a woman.
1324 2018-09-24 21:04:53 Economic genius??? Hahahaha. What are you smoking??? Putler stole $200B from RuSSians. Russia has a primitive economy of oil, minerals, caviar and weapons. They make nothing the world wants. All of the brains are in Ukraine. It’s a rust-bucket, crumbling, miserable country.
1325 2018-09-24 21:04:50 Is it wrong to drink straight olive oil? Asking for a friend.

1332 2018-09-24 21:03:54 Stocks slipped on growing concern about the outlook for global trade and U.S. politics. Oil rallied toward a four-year high.  Reports that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will leave his post also weighed on stocks.  Bloomberg
1333 2018-09-24 21:03:40 Oil is traded in dollars. The USA is the largest oil exporting country now. There just aren't enough of other currencies. One older idea is to have a basket of currencies that trade like a stock index.
1334 2018-09-24 21:03:33 Lol i know what you were getting at, i was just being a goof. Also i put coconut oil down my drains all the time i just run hot water for a few secs to get it to wash down far enough because im a bad person.

(Ben tried raw kale once - oh his little face!)
1344 2018-09-24 21:02:50 So are we agreeing that the $USD Will at some point Crater?  You cannot continually raise rates into $100 Oil + massive non fixed debt that other countries have taken on in $USD that is going to balloon and take down their own currencies leading to a wide spread default rate
1345 2018-09-24 21:02:48 I’ve never felt like a dumb bitch until I went to Valvoline for an oil change 
1346 2018-09-24 21:02:40 pig hATES me  he’s going to the vet so I filled his crate with crystals and essential oil 
1347 2018-09-24 21:02:40 Scheer, the people of this country will never let that pipeline be built. I know your number one job is to shill for big oil, but it will ultimately all be for nothing.
1348 2018-09-24 21:02:37 The hypocrisy of this is off the charts. You speak of peace while we sell weapons to saudi Arabia and watch them slaughter children in Yemen. We continue to buy their oil while they execute gay men. You should never mention peace again @JustinTrudeau . Youre not worthy

1360 2018-09-24 21:00:55 OPEC is a cartel n is crooked. They keep the price of oil artificially high by playing about with its production n storage. It's one of the reasons why petrol costs r high n inflation is high. OPEC is guilty of market manipulation...
1361 2018-09-24 21:00:49 Have ludo oil staked away somewhere in my closet together with their leave in ...will give it a try ...thank you 
1362 2018-09-24 21:00:49 It’s also because of your stress. Massage your head with oil like once or twice a week. Also, put the yellow part of the egg in your hair for an hr or so and then have a bath, it helps

there is a diff between factual answer and what youre referring to.
1384 2018-09-24 20:58:21 Lmfao, so I change and put oil in my car myself and it’s so funny when grown ass men ask me if I need help then get mad when I say no. If I needed help I would ask my dad 
1385 2018-09-24 20:58:07 Yes.  And our animals in the U. S.  (including mustangs) are under threat. Even off our coasts - re oil drilling - they'll all be gone if we don't watch out.  So will jobs like tourism - people like to see these animals.
1386 2018-09-24 20:58:00 Mmm... Como dicen lo cantado y lo bailado no se lo quita nadie.... Pero si fue gracioso hasta en Espn y Fox Sport salió la caída
1387 2018-09-24 20:57:49 Came to get an oil change before the gym.  Figured I’d eat and get some business handled.   Grabbed my book bag but left my food in the car 
1388 2018-09-24 20:57:24 Final mozzie bite tally for the week: 26. The only treatment that worked was lavender oil followed by diphenhydramine hydrochloride cream. Tried and tested on 20 of these bad boys.

1395 2018-09-24 20:56:53 Delta State. Milk the oil dry,  milk it dry, milk it dry again.  Then everybody go and learn how to code. (I mean move our heart and mind off oil for once,  we will not die)

1400 2018-09-24 20:56:07 Ah dinnae like tae complain but since Tories lack any form of creative genius (on the policy front) instead of just copying Scot Government (baby boxes etc) why donnae they copy Norway with an Oil Investment Fund? It’s a late starter (£1 Trillion behind so far)but plenty oil left
1401 2018-09-24 20:55:54 Y’all should get into the oil rigs or geothermals that shit pay
1402 2018-09-24 20:55:49 Manual says change oil at 10k but I'm gonna go ahead and make an appt for my almost 6k
1403 2018-09-24 20:55:47 I used organic coconut oil and some aloe from a plant and it helped my scar fade some.  It only holds about 2 days so you have to cut and mix often.

1412 2018-09-24 20:54:40 Much less than the creation of Fracked Oil or Tar Sands Bitumin, which both take huge amounts of chemicals with all of their transport in addition to petroleum.  Which just be itself uses 43% of all the electricity in the world just for petroleum.

1417 2018-09-24 20:53:45 Yet this pipeline has no effect on Saudi Arabia oil, we will still continue to import for eastern Canada.
Those numbers are from Kinder Morgan’s website citing number of permanent jobs created.
The per barrel premium has been refuted.
1418 2018-09-24 20:53:41 I like my #oatflour #recipe from that Eat Right 4 Your Blook Type cookbook (type A) when I followed that! Basically 1/2 reg. four, 1/2 oat, eggs, oil, salt, milk, & baking powder. Super easy, and you just have to add more flour & baking powder to make them super fluffy!
1419 2018-09-24 20:53:40 Personally i believe licences are only necessary for commercial ops which I would personally set at 50+ plants in flower.   People should be free to grow enough to make their own hash, oil and flower with some left over for friends and relatives etc.
1420 2018-09-24 20:53:37 This is probably my last time taking my mustang in to get an oil change  #bittersweet
1421 2018-09-24 20:53:25 rediscovering deep conditioning & hot oil treatments has brought my hair back to life  fuck was i doingggg

1423 2018-09-24 20:53:19 want my hair long & thick  i need some new oil to put in it
1424 2018-09-24 20:53:17 The US is the top oil producer in the world by now. If the price goes up, so will the production volume. I believe the current oil spike is not sustainable either way. Soon the market will be flush with increasingly cheaper to produce shale oil.
1425 2018-09-24 20:53:15 I hate truffle oil just about as much as I hate papyrus font.
1426 2018-09-24 20:52:43 American farmers are suffering. Oil prices are too high
1427 2018-09-24 20:52:41 no all fish oil is the same . Highly purified EPA is not same as Lovaza and studied proved it . You got to understand the biology of inflammatory resolution . Google it and buy $crbp . It’s drug hits same pathway
1428 2018-09-24 20:52:36 Oil ash from bunker C is even more toxic (potentially toxic?) than coal ash, all that vanadium.
1429 2018-09-24 20:52:33 Oil just have to deal with it
1430 2018-09-24 20:52:32 Yes! My husband showed me a video on what can happen if you take fish oil and number 1 was grow cup sizes. Lol.
1431 2018-09-24 20:52:27 Evening Primrose oil capsules. 
I’m taking it since a few months and definitely loving it - helps with cramps and probably with cysts too... not sure about that...but looks like.
1432 2018-09-24 20:52:22 SHE WAS PRACTICALLY DROWNING IN BODY OIL, ANDREW. IS SHE OKAY?

Looking back, yeah. Those movies SUCKED.
1433 2018-09-24 20:52:18 This is nothing to be proud of.  How can you look a child in the eye and tell them I support the destruction of the natural world.  Change is hard, I get it.  Even big oil is investing in renewables.  The writing is on the wall.

1437 2018-09-24 20:51:12 Zinke wants to get these lands all spruced up before putting them up for sale to Big Gas & Oil, Mining Interests & Big Timber.
What a good Swamp Monster Zinke is in Corrupt Trump's Swamp Olympics!
1438 2018-09-24 20:51:07 Why don’t people honestly just come out and say that oil companies are disguisting? #justsaying
1439 2018-09-24 20:50:49 but if you have sensitive skin don’t use tea tree oil
1440 2018-09-24 20:50:37 Speaking of clowns, just blocked you, Bot.  Recommend all do the same.
1441 2018-09-24 20:50:22 Finally getting my oil changed next my brakes and the rest of my car
1442 2018-09-24 20:50:15 Aloe Vera gel or tea tree oil helps
1443 2018-09-24 20:50:03 “Oil paint solvents can be very flammable, so don’t get any ideas”
1444 2018-09-24 20:49:59 Why is that trolling?  A person that denies evolution should not be looked to for scientific reasoning.  They are not a scientific reasoner by definition.

You can keep trying to demonize climate change believers, in the end you juar empower the oil companies to keep polluting.
1445 2018-09-24 20:49:52 My mom told me to anoint my throat with anointing oil cause it was bothering me and I haven't had to clear my throat since.

1462 2018-09-24 20:48:32 Started the day with bearish view on $AMRN FISH OIL results. Given that Omega 3 is sold everywhere. But i'm sure all doctors and FDA aren't clueless and there's more to it on this study. @adamfeuerstein optimistic view was the top off for me. I mean if he says good things...
1463 2018-09-24 20:48:10 Most Amazonian soy goes to China. Soy is not a safe food for animals (or humans) at a high % of diet, most soy feed is fed to them AFTER oil and protein has been extracted for human use.
1464 2018-09-24 20:48:09 Make decision for ourselves build a country using all the resources we have... we can be self dependant without imports .. support the fishing industry farmers oil water whisky tourism ...

1481 2018-09-24 20:45:33 I have sensitive skin &PCOS driven cystic acne. Tea tree oil body wash &face wash have literally changed my life  No single treatment for ANYTHING is going to work for EVERYONE. As always when you’re trying a new skincare product, do a test patch for a bad reaction first.

1491 2018-09-24 20:44:35 Similar to tortilla chips but bread and butter/olive oil at Italian restaurants  (especially in the northeast)
1492 2018-09-24 20:44:23 However...it MIGHT have something to do with highest Oil prices in 4+ years! 

Just maybe
1493 2018-09-24 20:44:17 Might want to have that sucralose tested for other ingredients (melamine?).  And cheap oil filters are a route to a seized engine. Shoe laces should be safe though.
1494 2018-09-24 20:44:17 How so?  With all of the drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and 1 major accident in 40 years, the risk is minimal.  There may not be any oil off the mid Atlantic, then again there may.  As usual, I disagree with you.  I don’t think that you fully understand the industry.
1495 2018-09-24 20:44:00 " I'm doing an experiment and was wondering if you sold Oil Burners"

1518 2018-09-24 20:40:50 It's so strange to me that one of the major contributors to our polluted water ways is raw sewage. Montreal, Victoria and even False Creek. But all gov officials talk about is oil and plastic. So disegenous and wreckless. Demonize the Petro Chem industry.

1520 2018-09-24 20:40:42 Higher oil prices are what you celebrate. Right?

You don’t care that we have to pay more to get back & forth to work.

1532 2018-09-24 20:39:47 and their Squalane too mixed in with your regular moisturizer, like it’s kind of oily itself but not in the gross way that it feels when your skin is super oily if that makes sense??? My skin doesn’t produce any more oil throughout the day after i apply it
1533 2018-09-24 20:39:36 Man everyone loves oil all of a sudden. To the moon they say.
1534 2018-09-24 20:39:35 In short. It doesn't.

Yh something might happen in a 1 off freak season(like leicester & all the big boys being randomly poor that yr). But in reality..we've hit our ceiling(poss over achieved) & need oil ££££££££
1535 2018-09-24 20:39:35 Need oil at 100
1536 2018-09-24 20:39:30 Unlucky for okanjuwa there is a oil stain on his cloth
1537 2018-09-24 20:39:30 For now, the tech isn't good enough and is too expensive. As much as you say it's not about the money, it really is. When the next gen tech is affordable and efficient enough for average people, it will be adopted. For now we have oil & gas.

1539 2018-09-24 20:39:21 I use the Mobil1 Annual Protection Ultimte Synthetic Oil for my truck. It’s high mileage so I wanna make sure she gets the best there is.

1543 2018-09-24 20:38:45 had to hide my sister’s statuses on facebook because she’s in an MLM that sells CBD oil and won’t shut up about it
1544 2018-09-24 20:38:41 You'd think Davies' Revolutionary Gap theory, when applied to Americans, must be close to being at a point where Americans are going to start waking up and realizing these politicians are nothing more than snake oil associates, right? . . Right?
1545 2018-09-24 20:38:41 3. He has not put his people fingered in corruption cases

1552 2018-09-24 20:38:15 Agree overall, but quibble w the weak economy. True in terms of long-term growth potential, because it’s an uninvestable mafia state. But stronger medium-term position due to oil prices, cyclical recovery, and proficient technocrats empowered to do conservative fiscal/monetary/FX

1554 2018-09-24 20:38:00 The current oil price is a fact and we are past peak production of oil from UK waters. That is all I am pointing out. I will happily allow a free thinker to draw their own conclusions.
1555 2018-09-24 20:37:56 #Kavanagh is just gonna oil out a calendar “from 1982”, to attempt@to prove he wasn’t at a party. Why have you kept 36 year old calendars? How many allegations were the #gop award they were going to have to fight?
1556 2018-09-24 20:37:50 Sedan, I had one and they’re mean as hell. Side note, get a performance oil pump before getting too wild with it. Mine went out and it’s a common issue with a few of the LS motors.
1557 2018-09-24 20:37:35 They Actually went. And stole the oil
1558 2018-09-24 20:37:34 " purchased stress relief headache pills.." I get severe headaches, it comes with depression & anxiety.

1559 2018-09-24 20:37:34 . @CochraneCBC - your NGP/GBR reference is fairly sweeping. Have you seen a map of the GBR?  Do the owners of the GBR ban oil pipelines?  Critical questions of the GoC position are in order.  If you think your views on what’s going on here is as you presented, that’s a mistake.

1561 2018-09-24 20:37:26 Their prescription fish oil returned fantastic results, which many were not expecting, in their clinical test.  With this result they should be able to expand into the US. This could be a HUGE breakthrough for heart disease in general.

1569 2018-09-24 20:36:40 #TrumpsTariffs are touted as a hit on China, Mexico, Canada, etc.

In reality we, the middle class, will pay for it all when the food, textiles, durable household goods, et. al. prices go up.

The consumer always ends up paying the #TariffTax.

And the price of oil is up.
1570 2018-09-24 20:36:23 I had a woman ask where to put oil in the car so I pointed out the cap with “ OIL “ written on it. A week later she said she could only find one with 710 on it. Think about it

1593 2018-09-24 20:33:16 Another of your conspiracy theories without sense or proof. UTIER or any union in PR has no power, no power to decide anything inside PREPA. Administrators of the agency responding to political parties and oil cartel are the ones making life or death decisions, not UTIER.

Our MCT Oil Powder only contains C8 and the blend is 40% oil and 60% acacia. Let us know if you have any other questions!

1633 2018-09-24 20:29:26 The metrics @PEPANZ1 are citing come directly from estimations made by the US oil companies, assuming that oil-fired combustion will be replaced by coal (massive oil-fired central heating in USA)

It is disingenuous and self-serving. Their sunset industry deserves to be outlawed.

1639 2018-09-24 20:29:14 Royalties to government for oil exploration are way too low ! No obligation for restitution. Why are companies investing in countries with higher royalties than Canada ? Obviously they would not be a barrier.
1640 2018-09-24 20:29:06 Point taken, but fair to say that the promise of improved performance is enough to tempt a few into trying any old snake oil/venom to get an edge, however mythical that may be. I blame the clever storyteller who gives them such ideas.

1650 2018-09-24 20:27:43 Andrew Scheer is telling untruths in his press conference. The cancellation of major oil projects began with the mid-2014 oil price decline, more than a year before the Trudeau (or NDP) governments came to power. #cdnpoli

1656 2018-09-24 20:26:49 And I add my thanks to you, Kiritapu, and to Minister Megan Woods for her principled stand against @PEPANZ1 self-interested and biased Advisory report.

1661 2018-09-24 20:25:35 Research online. 60-70% of your daily calories come from fat. Stay under 20g net carbs (carbs - fiber). Moderate amounts of protein. Butter, olive oil, coconut oil and other healthy fats like avocados are your friend.

1677 2018-09-24 20:23:18 BofAML: Signals from OPEC mean "the likelihood of an oil spike and crash scenario akin to the one observed in 2008 has increased."

1802 2018-09-24 20:09:15 what i meant is that we are in a very challenging period for the oil industry where supply is limited (in the upside), we have low inventories with low capex. Demand is strong.... the result is not a mistery. This is why i am worried. Despite the bla bla bla of the players.

Use the mixer to whoosh up lots of bread + garlic + parsley into breadcrumbs, put mushrooms into flat dish, take stalks out and lay them alongside the cups, mix breadcrumbs etc with butter (or low fat spread or olive oil) cover mushrooms bake
1805 2018-09-24 20:08:48 $100 oil back on the cards? Buei.
1806 2018-09-24 20:08:48 The Tories built the M25 from the proceeds of our oil. 
1807 2018-09-24 20:08:47 Yay... economy in trouble? Invade a oil rich country, contracts  galore
1808 2018-09-24 20:08:44 This is a new low for your argument.  We can heat with electricity.  Geothermal is way more efficient as are air source heat pumps. They would be cheaper too if governments stopped subsidizing big oil.

I am taking 5 feet off the statue.
1809 2018-09-24 20:08:36 Nothing these days is ever done. When oil is actually flowing through the pipe then we will have a successful pipeline.
1810 2018-09-24 20:08:33 Oil ends at $72.27 bbl
Where's the Saudi's???????
1811 2018-09-24 20:08:18 drink some tumeric tea bitch! and eat some soup and soft foods if you’re throat hurting. if not, eat anything. lol and get some oil of oregano!
1812 2018-09-24 20:08:15 Oil changes are highway robberies 
1813 2018-09-24 20:08:10 They don't want Alberta oil going through their province but they still want fuel. 

I know that's contradictory but the average person in BC doesn't so your plan won't bother them. 

I'm sorry you are so upset.
1814 2018-09-24 20:08:01 
1815 2018-09-24 20:07:37 Aside from all the other crap we have to deal with  now, #oil prices skyrocket at a time of year when they should be decreasing. This is about as scary as it would be if Kavanaugh does get confirmed. Not holding my breath that the Orange One cares or can fix either one, though.
1816 2018-09-24 20:07:36 It wasn’t leaving my hair moisturized. I would use it as a sealer and it wasn’t doing a good job (coconut oil).
1817 2018-09-24 20:07:28 Нашла какой-то драббл, у которого было дохера плюсов. Наивной дурочкой попёрлась читать. Это была НЦ-а по Мила/Нил. Меня тогда очень знатно пробомбило и я читала подряд всё, чтобы найти Гарик/Мила. Потом до меня дошло, что там есть пейринги. Но до сих пор терпеть не могу Нил/Мила
1818 2018-09-24 20:07:28 Our countries biggest problems are oil, the tax system, and healthcare. All cuz a few people are making billions off of it. I don’t get why everyone ignores/doesn’t give a fuck about how corrupt we are as a country
1819 2018-09-24 20:07:14 You should try making some sweet potato fries at home then!  Just cut them up, toss them in some olive oil or avocado oil and salt, and then bake on high heat (might have to stir them halfway through baking).  Delicious! 
1820 2018-09-24 20:07:11 Heard about the nails one ...quick question do I wash then apply the warmed oil or apply it on dry hair ?
1821 2018-09-24 20:06:57 No, all natural only. I won’t sell out. Beard oil’s and products are the worst
1822 2018-09-24 20:06:50 Look around you. Your life is full of materials made from oil. Yes we will stop burning it but we will continue to extract it for chemicals for some considerable time. And probably make more money from crude.
1823 2018-09-24 20:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
1824 2018-09-24 20:06:25 I really was a big girl and got my oil changed today
1825 2018-09-24 20:06:08 Aren’t you the guy that made fun of oil poop?
1826 2018-09-24 20:06:06 All I wanted was a oil change .. landmark gotta be extra and do other things

1828 2018-09-24 20:05:57 Yup: challenging unfair laws is also what she does, even if it displeases sorry-ass Albertans who couldn't care less about the rest of the country, with their self-serving arguments that global warming is a hoax intended to stop oil sands exploitation.

1830 2018-09-24 20:05:43 #PremierOil 130 then 135 my resistance levels  . I keep my longs and feel new year highs are going to come . #oil #brent . Surprised that with fundamentals like ZAMA the stock is not a lot higher yet
1831 2018-09-24 20:05:42 This enhanced rose oil I got got me smelling like a rose garden. To top it off, I got a massage oil that is a mixture of various essential oils. Feeling light, my skin smooth.
1832 2018-09-24 20:05:42 He and other evangelicals don't believe in God. They only use him for their religious BS and all the money they can scam from others who believe there is a God.

1835 2018-09-24 20:05:05 You can use the same grease you use on your scalp I use the wild growth moisturizing oil on my ends and it helps  and don’t use them lil combs that you’d use if you had a perm lol
1836 2018-09-24 20:04:58 Or aromatherapy oil for making toiletries if that's too demanding ;-) #EthicalHour
1837 2018-09-24 20:04:51 Познакомилась с фб, когда ещё фанатела по Миле Рудик. Услышав название "Мила Рудик и остров смерти" искала его тупо везде. Нашла один фанфик на фикбуке. Вырубила сразу после первых строчек нахер. Потом где-то через пол года уже сознательно искала по Миле фанфик.

1839 2018-09-24 20:04:47 I guess I come & get my oil changed so often that the guys just know me now
1840 2018-09-24 20:04:33 Both. Mostly oil tho
1841 2018-09-24 20:04:32 $CEI big spikes a few months ago put it on the map.  Company was profitable with low oil prices then...now oil is higher...company did a debit finance and sold assets to clean out the closet.  That's coming to a head now and is the reason for the move now. Just my opinions.
1842 2018-09-24 20:04:32 Indian hemp oil where ago get some buy

1849 2018-09-24 20:03:25 In a very tight oil market.... where inventories are getting lower and  lower.... if you put more obstacles to the global trades, you are just making the oil even more difficult to flow countries to countries.... creating spasms in the prices.... For you Ginger
1850 2018-09-24 20:03:24 Lol not really I’ll be prouder when there in the playoffs not sure the oil can duplicate that
1851 2018-09-24 20:03:12 Why does every woman selling essential oils become a "mystical love goddess wrapped in universe vibes "? It's just oil, ladies. Calm down.
1852 2018-09-24 20:03:06 I'm pretty allergic to tomato sauce, but I guess I could do something with an oil or pesto sauce. Not a big fan of reheated pasta, though

1855 2018-09-24 20:02:25 Remember all those predicting a collapse in 2013? Me either. I don’t put any stock in anyone predicting oil prices. Too many variables can change things in either direction. Til we can get more product to market somewhere other than the US. We will continue to get 60c on the $
1856 2018-09-24 20:02:15 Why did you stop using oil?
1857 2018-09-24 20:01:59 LOL - yeah. Me too. I oil the ends & use a curl cream or smoothing product. Then when it's still in the damp, you can move it without it transforming a curl into frizz, wrap into a large cinnamon bun style, or loosely braid. End result is soft waves and minimal frizz.
1858 2018-09-24 20:01:56 HOW DO MEN FIND ME ATTRACTIVE WHEN IM SWEATING MY ASS OFF COVERED IN ENGINE OIL DUDE GTF LMAO

1863 2018-09-24 20:01:13 Well said...

Nigeria is better now.
We were living in falsehood during PDP era. 
Similar situation Venezuela was and now see the mess in that oil producing country! 

Buhari has done well and Nigerians need to support the govt. Let's not allow looters throw back into darkness
1864 2018-09-24 20:01:11 Unless you or your child has really bad edges..you can saturate it with moisturizing oil and the edges will lay smooth and have shine..and it will keep you from using gels that harden and break the hair..
1865 2018-09-24 20:01:09 There are so many things now stoking inflation it’s crazy - immigration restrictions, tariffs, oil, etc.

1870 2018-09-24 20:00:36 1)I haven't researched so I don't have an intelligent answer
2)Their value is probably reduced going forward due to (a) greater volume & supply/demand plus (b) Trump EPA isn't good for anyone outside of big oil
3)Zero Q3+ credit sales would reduce probability for 2H profit

1872 2018-09-24 20:00:21 I totally agree with your view, however, I would add that this time we are near a very vicious oil crisis. I am not saying any price level, but the quantities (if you will) are looking every day even more constrained....
1873 2018-09-24 20:00:05 Go in for an oil change and they came back with a list of things I need that I dont have money for. 
1874 2018-09-24 20:00:03 Um dos assuntos principais da Rio Oil & Gas neste primeiro dia, a diversidade de gênero no setor foi tema da segunda plenária de hoje.
1875 2018-09-24 20:00:02 I didn't say I didn't support pharmacare, we just need to be transparent about what it means. And your numbers on the pipeline are just wrong - a $38 per barrel premium for Canadian oil will produce many thousands of jobs. Instead we support jobs in Saudi Arabia.
1876 2018-09-24 20:00:01 Throwing shrimp on a baking sheet w olive oil, salt & pepper. Cooking some pasta. Steaming some asparagus. Tossing it together in a big bowl. Eating it. I'm so done.
1877 2018-09-24 19:59:57 America companies depend on the oil for profit, nothing more. America invades and then uses America companies to rebuild.
1878 2018-09-24 19:59:51 This is how ya get traded in Montreal. Maybe he wants out? Beauty gesture from a great player on a serious note.

1881 2018-09-24 19:58:58 @CSPRColorado This Colorado Oil & Gas mouthpiece spews nonsense. No concern for home owners being killed. No concern for employees getting killed. No concern for children being evacuated from schools. No concern for destroyed property values. Just all in #GREED!!!
1882 2018-09-24 19:58:55 Uniquely identify your assets with an #RFID tag to reduce loss in the oil and gas industry.
1883 2018-09-24 19:58:43 That would have had more to do with the oil crises. But don't let truth get in the way.
1884 2018-09-24 19:58:26 There are foodbanks in Aberdeen, oil capital of Europe. Scottish old folk, disabled people & unemployed workers who can see oilrigs out to sea can't afford to heat their homes. PFI Labour have done nothing except squander our wealth and support Tory rule over Scotland
#RedTories
1885 2018-09-24 19:58:21 actually I have some friends on electric switching to oil.
1886 2018-09-24 19:58:19 The guy I in front is very clever , during d attack he isolated himself
1887 2018-09-24 19:58:15 “Does oil have dairy in it?” @katiedeserp
1888 2018-09-24 19:57:41 I'm sick of people getting stuck with the bills left by big oil, coal, and gas companies.

- They cause #ClimateChange related disasters
- We get stuck with the costs of rescue and recovery
- They pocket the all the profit
- We donate cash to those affected by disasters.
1889 2018-09-24 19:57:39 there are many indications our motivation n ME not only oil, but what Israel wants for themselves to happen & "we" oblige & do their bidding~
1890 2018-09-24 19:57:36 Requesting our Finance Minister Asad Omar to provide us the details of how we were looted from previous govt: ENGRO & Fuji fertilizer, use of furnace oil  that was used, circulate debt &  plants that were used wrong previously. AUDIT REQUIRED !!

1893 2018-09-24 19:57:27 Non-THC CBD oil is legal in all 50 states as a dietary supplement. How can @Youtube say it’s a problem to talk about it? Would they remove videos recommending taking a daily dose of raw apple cider vinegar, too??
1894 2018-09-24 19:57:16 Foolish not brave
1895 2018-09-24 19:57:14 Well that can't be right can it ? I keep hearing screams of the EU being  undemocratic. How many May's does it take to change a light bulb? only  her but she changes it to a antique oil lamp to avoid the power cuts.
1896 2018-09-24 19:57:01 Lol so I just got an oil change and Im waiting on them to bring my car, its raining hard where I'm at and they took through the carwash
1897 2018-09-24 19:56:52 In the oil ! B naked too.,  yeah find that one... cut out all our existence to make nice little dress code.  Dancing in old dead bird feathers forever @realDonaldTrump how we caught birds ! Eat b everything! Chicken not wild! B a pet trained for the food chains. ©®
1898 2018-09-24 19:56:45 what the f did you do to OIL prices?
1899 2018-09-24 19:56:31 Also, I’ve opted out of using and oil. I just make sure my cream is really thick and moisturizing
1900 2018-09-24 19:56:29 Why is it so fucking hard to cook ham? Like damn, I just wanna fucking eat delicious ham why does the oil from the pan have to hurt me?
1901 2018-09-24 19:56:05 Tell me again how many billions of $$$ your family makes from oil and gas???
1902 2018-09-24 19:56:04 okay well good to know it's not oil
1903 2018-09-24 19:55:59 Yes but this might be later in in the decision process. Gotta want one first before you don't trust it... I think. Also most installers won't offer them. If you're on gas, it's gas. On oil, oil and if you have electric, it's Argos.
1904 2018-09-24 19:55:50 This is just awesome. Thank you, Leon - Edmonton loves you! 
1905 2018-09-24 19:55:46 This is incredible Leon, thank you for representing and giving back to the city of Edmonton!

If Iranian oil is stopped will Russia benefit from it some way? Oil prices for example?
1907 2018-09-24 19:55:26 February 2018: I changed the oil in my car
June 2018 and 5,000 miles post oil change: car was in shop for repairs equaling $500. Refused to spend $30 on an oil change
Almost October, 13,000 miles since last oil change, and the motor industry still will not get my $30
1908 2018-09-24 19:55:19 Lol my mom bought my grandpa 300mg full spectrum CBD oil & didnt let me try it first. Praying it doesn’t knock him on his ass...

1910 2018-09-24 19:54:48 tonight I will fever dream about 2015-16 freelee the banana girl making a drama video exposing me for guzzling orange flavoured cod liver oil
1911 2018-09-24 19:54:37 @MiddletonPlays I bet your here already! Enjoying a brand new mod to give you that new addiction you need that could add a new style to your 'Let's Play". Although it's already at the charming level "Oil Tot"!
1912 2018-09-24 19:54:35 sold it to a developing oil state
1913 2018-09-24 19:54:32 Rates cooking higher with oil.
1914 2018-09-24 19:54:09 Keep something in mind, “joining his teammates for practice” means very little in the grand scheme.

Corey Crawford is still far from being the #Blackhawks starting goalie.  Get use to that.

Still a bunch of beachfront property and snake oil they are selling you.
1915 2018-09-24 19:53:58 In NYC we have laughed at him since the ‘80’s.He was the buffoon in the corner no one wanted 2talk to or know.He’s a braggart,an idiot,a snake oil salesman &behaves &talks inappropriately 4a civil decent thinking human being.The only thing that’s changed is u can now add dementia
1916 2018-09-24 19:53:49 I purchased a new oil diffuser and I’m thirsty to use it tonight!
1917 2018-09-24 19:53:14 We will never change the minds of environmentalists or indigenous groups that oppose oil. There view is zero tolerance.
The oil industry has proved they want middle ground, but opponents won't meet there. So majority must rule on this.
1918 2018-09-24 19:53:10 Absolutely we are in Transition but that is being slowed dramatically and artificially by huge influence on media and government by lobbying from oil industry. Demand from concerned citizens is the only counter to that influence. We are completely out of time to #ActOnClimate
1919 2018-09-24 19:53:04 Obviously my heart goes out to the “old country” that has steadfastly coped under the burden of immense oil and gas wealth for decades....life is a bitch isn’t it?....    #itscoming #indyref2
1920 2018-09-24 19:52:53 Idk how u bitchz save n reuse oil like I don’t even wanna use the same oil for my 2nd batch of chicken #WeNotTheSameSis
1921 2018-09-24 19:52:44 tack så mycket pappa jag dricka oil nu
1922 2018-09-24 19:52:34 Is this legit?  Everything recently said the contrary about fish oil supplements...
1923 2018-09-24 19:52:32 lots of olive oil and Cirio tomatoes!
1924 2018-09-24 19:52:26 No big oil, NRA, KKK, I can go on and on... Just not us simple folk that work for a living.
1925 2018-09-24 19:52:18 The tomato sauce is thicker, thin crust, olive oil, mozzerella is then placed on the thick sauce then another layer of sauce
1926 2018-09-24 19:52:15 I jus geeked at baby oil 
1927 2018-09-24 19:52:04 ^hark, a troll!
Block’n’roll!

Oil industry, plastics, car manufacturing, retail & distribution of cars, etc, coal mining, coal power generation - all the vested interests, all the deniers, all the profiteers. Banks like @ANZ_NZ are complicit by business loan investment.

Evil.
1928 2018-09-24 19:52:01 #Venezuela is 80% privately owned economy. The shortages are in this part of the economy. You can get toilet paper, but not tissues, although both are made by the same companies. It is owed billions from oil revenue it can't receive because of USA financial sanctions.
1929 2018-09-24 19:51:57 A little drizzle of chilli olive oil would make it extra special 
1930 2018-09-24 19:51:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Santa Claus is just Jesus in a colorful costume!
1931 2018-09-24 19:51:50 Why does everyone on Twitter care so much about how often other people get their oil changed?
1932 2018-09-24 19:51:42 Rolled in to get an oil change exactly 5000 miles after my last one.

The dad in me is still stoked about this.
1933 2018-09-24 19:51:41 I miss u Bae
1934 2018-09-24 19:51:31 Hey Chris how’s my oil change
1935 2018-09-24 19:51:29 I still don't understand what's hard for Americans to understand trump is being controlled by Russia. Look at the sanctions on Iran and how it affects the oil price. When obama lifted it Russian economy was almost in shreds. They needed trump to win badly
1936 2018-09-24 19:51:27 Really?
Folks getting mad at who they might bring in to be the backup QB.. lol 

Without Sherman and the secondary leaking oil there are more important question marks than who the backup QB is 

This team is lucky AZ is on the schedule twice in the next five games.
1937 2018-09-24 19:51:10 With "carnivore" I have TG so low that online calculators ask me to check again if I put the correct value...and I eat plenty of pork belly, butter and cheese. Supplementing Fish oil serves only to counteract excess O6, in my ignorant opinion.
1938 2018-09-24 19:51:08 I like the Midnight Oil album; like not-in-this-tournament LPs by Tears For Fears & the Waterboys it's an artistic peak for an aging "Modern Rock" act, that just doesn't fit into the 1993 narrative. I threw it a vote knowing I won't have another chance, unlike Enter The Wu-Tang.

1940 2018-09-24 19:50:36 Feeling energized this afternoon. Monday’s can be a drag but i made an effort to get out of bed early and get my morning activities done. Exercised, @HalElrod podcast, silence time, @NaturesUltra CBD oil, protein shake, and . No mid afternoon crash for me. #MondayMotivation

1943 2018-09-24 19:50:31 I'm so sad i missed this golden pre-stream, but i know someone or quite a few of you have it saved and downloaded. 

Pretty much, DSP's toxic chat and shitty mods threw away his rich oil baron. I like how everything with DSP ends on bad terms/poorly, not once an amicable parting.
1944 2018-09-24 19:50:28 Alright I guess I’m gonna mix equal parts sugar and olive oil together and then scrub it on my face later. Stay tuned for results
1945 2018-09-24 19:50:23 anyone have any remedies for eye strain? sitting in front of a computer 40+ hours a week for work and school is killing me and cbd oil can only help my body so much lol
1946 2018-09-24 19:50:11 I think we already have enough reserves to screw up the planet big time. There is an argument that emissions from gas combustion are lower than oil or coal - but the greenhouse impact of methane is a lot worse than CO2, so if more than 2 or 3 percent of gas leaks, it's worse ...

1953 2018-09-24 19:49:28 Well of course the OPEC projections show growth. The Saudis are planning an IPO of their state owned oil company, if they did not show growth, that would make the IPO worth a lot less.

1960 2018-09-24 19:48:21 But Larry, shouldn’t we want to see how this fits with the body of evidence to see what the current best estimate of effect is? Or should we ignore all prior RCTs of fish oil/omega 3 supplements and take only the effect as measured in this one? If so why?
1961 2018-09-24 19:48:18 I still don't understand what's hard for Americans to understand trump is being controlled by Russia. Look at the sanctions on Iran and how it affects the oil price. When obama lifted it Russian economy was almost in shreds. They needed trump

Euro couldn't be too cheap though with high oil prices
1967 2018-09-24 19:47:44 CBD oil? going public in Canada?
1968 2018-09-24 19:47:42 Nothing is being done about the demand for oil products. So we will still continue to use the same amount of oil, we'll just be importing it from the other side of the world from less efficient production. MORE damage to environment.
1969 2018-09-24 19:47:40 well that was a big shake quake, Fing oil and gas drillers in this country SUCK I am so sick of it all
1970 2018-09-24 19:47:40 US equities were in a cautious mood following China’s abandonment of trade talks with the US, the S&P500 down 0.3%. Brent crude oil is up 3.3% after OPEC indicated less urgency to boost output. US bond yields were stable while currencies were mixed.

1984 2018-09-24 19:46:23 ITS 2018 and my oil change still takes 3 hours?!?
1985 2018-09-24 19:46:20 some of my favorite artists are convinced of the same idea. that is, of chasing some idea or concept and attempting to capture it in the art whether it's music or oil on canvas or the written word.
1986 2018-09-24 19:46:17 @RichardBurgon How goes Venezuela? Still the thriving economy with its people happy in the knowledge they have the world's largest oil reserves? Or has it turned into a chaotic Corbynite hell hole? Answers on a postcard.
1987 2018-09-24 19:46:11 I love it:  oil is up nearly 46% YTD, YET the Fed and Trump are telling us there's no inflation #ROFLMAO
1988 2018-09-24 19:46:07 In that case, make sure you don’t select prestidigitation or snake oil sales, because you clearly don’t have the chops.

Long answer: Fuck no

The only “brains” brexit had were deployed peddling lies, deceit, snake oil, cakeist exceptionalism, fantasy, racism, xenophobia oh and electoral crimes
1995 2018-09-24 19:45:42 La segunda parte son Bajada de Palo (Vista & Oil), La Amarga Chica (YPF), Bandurria Sur (YPF), Bandurria Centro (PAE) y Bandurria Norte (Wintershall). No sumo Sierras Blancas - Cruz de Lorena (Shell) q también anunció q pasaba a desarrollo masivo, ni otras áreas probables.
1996 2018-09-24 19:45:40 Cheney/Bush's Libby-Miller (outting CIA Plame, whose hubby disputed WH WMD fab; pretext for Iraq invasion) wasn't just about oil. It was also a hit job on NYT. Folks don't get how much natl bcast etc news relies on NYT work & infrastructure that neither they or 2nd hand pays for.
1997 2018-09-24 19:45:36 Fareed. I still don't understand what's hard for Americans to understand trump is being controlled by Russia. Look at the sanctions on Iran and how it affects the oil price. When obama lifted it Russian economy was almost in shreds.

1999 2018-09-24 19:45:27 NZ Labour’s achievement will be steep rises in oil and electricity prices resulting in a prolific increase in strikes to make up for the diminishing value of income. Bright idea

2001 2018-09-24 19:45:15 3. Assuming for a moment the results are truly positive and Vascepa goes on to achieve great commercial success (as seems reasonably likely now). Will Amarin continue to support off-label promotion for *other* fish oil products? (I think I know the answer to this question!)

2005 2018-09-24 19:44:53 Plus, you need water to extract oil & gas, too, don't you?
2006 2018-09-24 19:44:52 you know what I loved the taste of as a kid? my cod liver oil supplement that was orange flavoured. I would beg for another spoon like some victorian urchin.
2007 2018-09-24 19:44:42 I was insane for decades from the lack of animal fat.  Avocados didn't do it, olive oil nothing to it.
2008 2018-09-24 19:44:41 Oil is now sold at $81/barrel. Why is the dollar still exchanging at N360?
2009 2018-09-24 19:44:40 Success: my family aren’t grossed out by pumpkin anymore alhamdullilah. I made a mean soup by roasting pumpkin, carrots, garlic, bell peppers and red onion in an olive oil, turmeric, cinnamon and nutmeg marinade. Blended and boom!

A freaking cat fell out with maggots pouring out of it.

Just like the stuff of your nightmares. 
Holy. Shit.
2014 2018-09-24 19:43:42 Oil producers are keen to claim there will be growth. If they admit the vast majority of the assets on which their shares and in some cases governments are founded will have to stay in the ground they are toast. They are putting off facing up to this as long as they can.
2015 2018-09-24 19:43:19 I would so appreciate a palm oil meal right now
2016 2018-09-24 19:43:02 @SpookyWoobler Hey do you want some CBD oil? It’s by a company called Omni Flower. They’re based here in Canada :) It’s completely hemp derived so it’s not illegal in anyway. I’m in BC I’d be happy to send you some! No cost at all. Just wanna help a fellow Canadian if I can.

2019 2018-09-24 19:42:33 SDF ending oil trade between Assad/Iran & ISIS in this area. They will still stand together in opposition to Arab state leaders but other than that their trade & ability to use ISIS leaders to affect circumstances on a large scale are diminished somewhat

2021 2018-09-24 19:42:16 Norway also last year has decided to double their off-shore oil drilling. 

And they still do deforestation in the future. But companies have to guarantee to plant the same amount of trees. Like in Germany. Kind of.
2022 2018-09-24 19:42:10 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
2023 2018-09-24 19:42:04 Tell me something Andrew, why are you not chapping the doors of all the lying bastards who said the oil was about gone?

2028 2018-09-24 19:41:35 Means you can oil whenever it gets dry and keep it fresh.
2029 2018-09-24 19:41:32 A bigger problem for #AtuallyAutistic people is that they are often made unwelcome on  #autism tags by 'warrior mums', cure-ists, snake oil pedlers, patronising professionals/ researchers, anti-vaxers. These are about us but have become a shouting match. Please, not our tag too!
2030 2018-09-24 19:41:27 Its not economic growth, its gdp growth because France and Italy started to operate on theor oil fields again. You re really ignorant. USA and Russia are same shit but USA destroyed far more countries than Russia.

2059 2018-09-24 19:38:37 For really low carb I just saute small mushrooms (whole or halved) with leeks (cut into 1/2 inch chunks) in stock with a bit of butter/oil added. Surprisingly filling on its own, can also add cooked chicken, or use as a side dish.

2073 2018-09-24 19:36:44 Hmm yeah you've already been schooled on that subject idiot. We'll have a state run oil company will we? Might want to tell the SNP that then cos thats the only way to harness any major profit. Norway has 'Statoil' the clue is in the name

2076 2018-09-24 19:36:25 @CalConservation I was looking at your oil production data I'm only seeing up until February 2018 (on the FTP site).  Is data available that is more recent than this?  If so, where is it located?  Thanks.
2077 2018-09-24 19:36:14 Go to the doctor &get diagnosed, but do the treatment with a homeopathic specialist who will cure you &not put you on drugs for the rest of your days.

2084 2018-09-24 19:35:16 The save oil scam today is the same as the 1970's when tankers sat in the Gulf of Mexico and our government would not allow them to unload, people were rashoned gas. If America is the #1 oil producer then our government should not be taking advantage of its own people.

2095 2018-09-24 19:34:12 Tuna sandwich is pretty good too! Like getting the olive oil tuna from the supermarket. And using that for a sandwich. And idk if you’ve ever tried Spanish chorizo (it’s also good and another topping for a sandwich).
2096 2018-09-24 19:34:08 The oil industry’s business plan requires a climate catastrophe. They want to profit from misery while trying to confuse the science.
2097 2018-09-24 19:34:07 Hey Derek, you realize the oil is coming your way no matter what by pipeline or by rail. which way do you want it to come?
2098 2018-09-24 19:33:59 No.. DHA is the real answer. Anyone pushing EPA is doing it for financial interests or financed by it. What do you prefer coconut oil or butter? Let's keep it simple. Just as some would push ALA, some encourage EPA. Diabetes, metabolic syndrome stress block enzymatic processes.
2099 2018-09-24 19:33:57 This is like the third time I go somewhere for a service and after I ask something it seems like they totally forget about me or something I’m about to walk right out of this fucking pharmacy , I’ll take my chances with cannabis oil
2100 2018-09-24 19:33:37 It’s our fault for not having blind faith in the band of snake oil salesmen & dirtbags in Parliament. We didn’t believe enough, or at all really, so of course it’s all our fault 
2101 2018-09-24 19:33:30 I might see if I can buy a Japanese language hand book on Buyee. Bizarrely, most of the under bonnet labels and warning lights are in English, though there's a nice oil change sticker from Autobacs, too.

2108 2018-09-24 19:32:42 50k is a good goal. I’d have to lease that hoe. Oil change gone $1000 dollars 
2109 2018-09-24 19:32:41 Oh, you mean Obama, who had the entire DOJ in his pocket or is it Bush one or Bush 2 who were in bed with the oil czars.
2110 2018-09-24 19:32:27 would be nice if they could break down loads by oil and condensates - that number is not all crude.

2124 2018-09-24 19:30:56 Not telling people how to fan. Just telling those people, hey, you're being shitty.  That makes you a shitty fan. But you're certainly free to do that. As an aside, the quality of the Oil fan base is the sum of the qualities of the fans, including the shitty.  Just is what it is.

Then getting put out of work when the price ain't right.
2137 2018-09-24 19:29:55 Scottish oil and gas is not magic. Its just as devastating to the planet as fossil fuels anywhere else are. And there's a lot of it. How can you think it will not be devastating?
2138 2018-09-24 19:29:52 I think I’m in love with Muji oil cleanser and I purchased it on a whim. It does the job and the texture is divine! 
2139 2018-09-24 19:29:46 That reminds me of the best ever Rowan colour, which was Scottish Tweed in Herring. Grey, but a grey which was the grey of an oil slick on a road-edge puddle.

2151 2018-09-24 19:28:43 No problem except the laughing stock it has made of country, the damage it will do, especially to poorest. No problem except the division it causes & the zealoted supporters who swallow the obvious lies. No problem except snake oil salesmen like you.
2152 2018-09-24 19:28:21 The 'collapse of the world' won't come from gas and oil exploration in Scottish waters.
2153 2018-09-24 19:28:18 $AMRN dont short cause its just "fish oil". Doctors will write scripts for this and tell people don't buy otc (if they ask). Average person cant figure out active ingredients , purity ect.

2162 2018-09-24 19:27:12 @SIRIUSXM   You made a big mistake shortening “Tell Me Everything with @JohnFugelsang” and replacing it with that fake religious snake oil salesmen Dave Ramsey and the other crackpot.  Put them on one of your religious stations and give TME back it’s third hour!!!!
2163 2018-09-24 19:27:04 ON NOW: @PEPANZ1 tells us it's time for an urgent review of govt's policy on ending oil & gas exploration permits. Deputy Prime Minister @winstonpeters joins @GuyonEspiner with his response.
2164 2018-09-24 19:26:49 Handwaving nonsense — it’s not SIMPLY sap. The resin polymerization takes thousands of years to produce copal then volatile oil evaporation takes up to millions of years depending on size and conditions.
2165 2018-09-24 19:26:46 That worked really well in Venuzuela

2167 2018-09-24 19:26:24 @NZMorningReport This oil and gas spin merchant lives in a world of denial doesn't he?
2168 2018-09-24 19:26:22 Climate change is no respecter of national borders. If our gas can replace heavier and dirtier coal and oil based energy production for the 20 or so years that it may take to make all of Europe and beyond self-sufficient in renewables, then thats a good outcome surely?
2169 2018-09-24 19:26:08 Yesterday I had 13 things on my to-do list. Knocked all 13 out. Not to mention cooking dinner AND filling my car up AT NIGHT. THEN got to the gym 15min early this morning just to get to work and close a huge oil and gas account. Ya girl is TIRED!!!!!!!!

2183 2018-09-24 19:24:09 . I’m very adamant on telling people we’re a traditional oil company. Not reinventing the wheel, just changing the way it’s capitalized.

2202 2018-09-24 19:22:38 I'd rather have oil whose use and export can benefit everyone than a court decision that benefits a single ethnic group only.

PS Guy, did you manage to trick anyone with your emails about giving you personal donations to combat your "election debt"?
2203 2018-09-24 19:22:31 Folks, I don’t do a lot of product reviews on here and I, for the most part, hate my skin but if you have oily skin I highly recommend Herbivore Lapis facial oil. Even though my skin is oily, it’s dry so I over produce. I use Lapis at night and I’ve noticed a major difference.

2215 2018-09-24 19:20:35 I did a protein treatment and hot oil last night
2216 2018-09-24 19:20:21 What's worse, expensive oil encourages producers of inefficient sources to start extracting again - think fracking, tar sands, etc.

The only people who benefit are hydrocarbon governments and oil majors
2217 2018-09-24 19:20:20 Labour led us into an illegal war for oil, whats your point?
2218 2018-09-24 19:20:16 From: me
To: you
Increasing the salary 

I have greatly enjoyed working at shell Company for the past four years. In those years, I have become an integral member of the oil properties  team, and have developed innovative ways to contribute to the company.
I believe I have gone.
2219 2018-09-24 19:20:01 And  will start accept new projects when oil will hit 90 accompanied with demand destruction :))
2220 2018-09-24 19:19:59 I wish I could dip her in lavender oil! It does help!
2221 2018-09-24 19:19:59 And DL Hayes who tore his ACL by trying not to land on Carr. Give Roger Goodell the wonder bag treatment, without the olive oil. Man I always wanted to say that.
2222 2018-09-24 19:19:56 Ongoing discussion is about the engineer survivor who had himself coated with oil..

2224 2018-09-24 19:19:47 @SecretaryZinke I think maybe you forgot that the government doesnt and shouldn't work for the oil companies because you already work for someone....you work for The American People you dumbass.
2225 2018-09-24 19:19:37 Only in some sort of oil porn film.

2234 2018-09-24 19:18:31 He is a disaster capitalist and a snake oil salesman.  That Govt listen to these types is genuinely appalling.
2235 2018-09-24 19:18:29 Yeah, depends on the speed of transition. If Elon really does manage to do half of what he promises, then the oil price will fall through the floor and a lot of fields will become really uneconomical.
2236 2018-09-24 19:18:25 I’m making vegan chocolate chip cookies and the coconut oil kinda smells like pussy
2237 2018-09-24 19:18:04 Sounds fantastic!!!! Have you ever used a NuWave?  If you know anyone who has one- ask to see how it works- amazing. I mainly use an old old oil stove and have an electric stove- we bought a used oil stove for spare parts when needed- so we are set!
2238 2018-09-24 19:18:02 I respect SA. I support SA against the Canadian Trudeau. I support SA because they maintain fair oil prices, I respect SA because they have benefited their people and made them prosperous. I love SA because they always support US. Thank you from bottom of my heart.

2249 2018-09-24 19:16:14 @SenateMajLdr needs to retire. Too many years spent selling snake oil have made you tired and bitter. Remember your proudest moment, withholding a Supreme Court nominee from Pres. Obama and call it a night.

2262 2018-09-24 19:14:37 Does anyone else vape CBD oil?  I was getting that anxious, trapped feeling that seem to be so common lately and a couple hits calmed me right down.  Thinking of hitting the store for some oil with a little THC in it too.
2263 2018-09-24 19:14:20 Question .
Venezuela the highest oil production in the world!  
They can sell their oil and will be revenue by $ 
Why is that happen!!

Please attend to the oil & ration Mafias operating in town, not only they are a huge threat to the economy but they also abuse law and order due to the nature of their business and cause threat to the peace and well being around where they operate.

2273 2018-09-24 19:13:12 If you could replace cheddar with Parmesan-Regiano, then add fresh basil and olive oil for a nice summery pasta. Or, swap out the fresh tomato for sun-dried tomato, finely chopped, then add crushed red pepper for spicy tomato melted cheddar pasta.

2275 2018-09-24 19:13:11 Might be right. Krill oil might even work better. Management has been beyond slow to move this forward though.
2276 2018-09-24 19:13:05 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.

2279 2018-09-24 19:12:50 As for Peter's point on extra-fuel uses, we have to remember that we currently burn about 80% of extracted oil and gas. I wonder what the industry looks like when demand goes through the floor.  I'd hazard that a great deal of proven reserves become uneconomic.
2280 2018-09-24 19:12:36 Nail shop oil change n sprint 
2281 2018-09-24 19:12:25 Look at Venezuela you say, the same country that has the world's largest oil reserves is now, being strangled by sanctions imposed by the US to try and force a, change in their political stance. The country has a commodity that the US has invaded and bombed countries for - OIL.
2282 2018-09-24 19:12:17 How much of the Russian oil company sale (19%) found its way into McConnell’s bank accounts?
2283 2018-09-24 19:12:07 you may want to look into the exact ingredients of the cbd oil you are using. We hope cbd gives you relief soon!
2284 2018-09-24 19:11:57 Wow, so one of those oil changes would cover my Supercharging expenses for almost 2 years.  I suspect Igor doesn't grasp how inexpensive it is to fuel an EV.

2295 2018-09-24 19:11:09 ...if by “sad”, you mean there is some schadenfraude to watch someone come to terms with realization “there is no honor among thieves.” Hard to have sympathy for someone who gets back-stabbed after selling some or all of his soul; good guys know snake oil when it approaches.
2296 2018-09-24 19:11:03 I done got my oil change and everything and I’m clueless to the fact as why my car sound like a Harley Davidson Bike .. when I accelerate

2310 2018-09-24 19:08:50 Do a piece about the amount of WATER that has to get used in oil production!
2311 2018-09-24 19:08:49 In Spain there's a urban legend (or not) that says it is almost impossible for a Spanish company to distribute olive oil in the USA because of the pressure of the mafia.
2312 2018-09-24 19:08:43 A small tidbit of info, ASTM color codes are just a different format for Munsell color codes. For example, the ASTM code 25 7 10 is equal to the Munsell code 5Y 7/10. Both specify Hue, Value (Lightness), Chroma. For example, dyes and crude oil use ASTM.

2318 2018-09-24 19:07:38 Um... yeah, it does.
Coal is the worst. Lot of densely packed complex hydrocarbons and carcinogenic chemicals -and it releases particulates when burned.
Oil is slightly better, especially the refined petroleums.
Gas is the "cleanest" (if you want to use that term).

2348 2018-09-24 19:05:31 still pushing the myth that the Iraq War was for oil?In 2018? As recently as December 2012,Iraq provided the United States with approximately 14.3 million barrels of oil out of a total of about 298 million barrels imported, or 4.8 percent of our total imports. And as this chart
2349 2018-09-24 19:05:25 This is amazing! We love hearing positive stories from CBD oil use <3
2350 2018-09-24 19:05:24 Nonsense.     All the revenue goes to the American-owned oil corporations.

Meaning, the Canadian govt is a frontman for them, trying to increase their profits.
2351 2018-09-24 19:05:15 Death of the travel industry. Just like gas/coal/oil and release of free energy.
2352 2018-09-24 19:05:12 Something incredibly sweet about watching that city doc seeing them celebrating in the changing room when they beat us 5-0, knowing that there's 3 spankings on the way for the oil shagging plastic bastards
2353 2018-09-24 19:05:11 $AMRN smells like there's a good chance they may pull a discounted public offering on this overblown fish oil pill. I'm going to make one in my basement tonight and compete. @CNBC pulled another $TLRY by bringing on the CEO with some very convenient timing.
2354 2018-09-24 19:04:42 @Archaeologuy so the Oil should send Bouchard back to Junior and then the only question on D is whether or not Jerabek has won a job over Garrison?  I think Ethan Bear stays doesn't he? #Oilers
2355 2018-09-24 19:04:32 Look i am for electric school buses and commuter buses. Both vehicles o have are 4 cylinder. Its people. We have a capitalist market. But i would tax the oil. Not cool with supporting people who hate me an overcharge me for something
2356 2018-09-24 19:04:10 Same here. I started using CBD oil. It helps, but I've also had to get a mouth guard...grinding my teeth at night.

2358 2018-09-24 19:03:49 That means, any reduction in punctures and derailments would be magnified and improve safety more than the so-called marginal improvement (which is still an improvement).

The oil industry just values loss of life less than flowing oil to markets.
2359 2018-09-24 19:03:48 Way more than that. OTC fish oil was just proven once and for all in August that there is no benefit. Vascepa on the other hand may keep you alive if you have cardio issues.
2360 2018-09-24 19:03:46 But @realDonaldTrump just told us two weeks ago the US was the largest producer of oil in the world.. how could this be? Isn't price gouging illegal?
2361 2018-09-24 19:03:40 if you have ever considered trying a hemp oil to combat anxiety, let us know. We would love to help you!

2363 2018-09-24 19:03:39 I swear this supposed Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is ridiculous. None if these doctors are realizing it's not just the weed. If the grower uses Neem Oil and other pesticides and its combusted for consumption. Those pesticides get turned into nasty chemicals.
2364 2018-09-24 19:03:24 Hey Farmers, Why not take 25% of Your vegetables such as Corn, Soybeans ECT, Sell it directly to the Government. For fuels for Cars Cosmetics, Medicines ECT. No more War over foreign Oil, Guaranteed Money for You and Your Family. = INDEPENDENT AMERICA
2365 2018-09-24 19:03:22 How can the 'fumes' from burning this oil drive away mosquitos. Mosqs' dont have olfactory power do they?
2366 2018-09-24 19:03:12 Has anyone #onhere used CBD oil?
2367 2018-09-24 19:02:52 No dude I’ve never tried them but ima go buy some then cause it bothers me how I still continue to have oil on my face 
2368 2018-09-24 19:02:46 I was thinking of NL, but I might have that number wrong. However, that other number is even harder. Also, burning other things is still as much a problem as is oil.
2369 2018-09-24 19:02:21 Hopefully sometime this week I’ll get my oil done in my car
2370 2018-09-24 19:02:17 Alexa, a device designed to open the world of possibilities. Mine is just there to remind me to take my cod liver oil supplements...
2371 2018-09-24 19:02:16 lolol - every drop of oil produced is sold.
2372 2018-09-24 19:02:13 every time i get my oil change they bring up something else i need done but this time they offered $20 off so i’m gettin stuff done #adult

2377 2018-09-24 19:02:00 Oil prices about to rise more. Has anyone investigated what members of Congress and the administration are stockholders in oil companies?
2378 2018-09-24 19:01:59 No, those odds  came out of thin air and are not based on any current reality. We are not going to risk the oil fire hazard of hauling so much oil through North America’s 3rd most densely populated cities or the risk of oil spills, more fuel spills and increased marine traffic.
2379 2018-09-24 19:01:54 Oil producers like instability as it put the price of oil up.
2380 2018-09-24 19:01:48 Thing about $XON & possibly others (if they can do it too) would be to make it not only cost effective (as say they can), but more uniform where you trust what you are buying, whether CBD oil, or any future THC approved products, sort of like with Ginseng, etc. Could be huge.

2382 2018-09-24 19:01:24 To be fair the gas and oil companies are just filling the market.  If we want to change the market then the consumer has to demand better products.

2385 2018-09-24 19:01:03 My general diet is about to become a lot more restricted.
Fuck all you manufacturers who use palm oil in your recipes. And I'm going to start listing them.
Yes that includes you today, Thorntons caramel shortcake squares and Tescos chocolate éclairs.
Sad times.

2394 2018-09-24 19:00:11 The good thing about driving an old truck is you never have to have an official oil change.. just change the filter every 6 months and add new oil as needed

2396 2018-09-24 19:00:06 The oil industry is just catching up to where I was when I stopped mass production I stopped picking up garbage bags now doing research that I have done many years ago what works and what does not funny will they be doing what I am now in ten years
2397 2018-09-24 19:00:02 Helped by oil
2398 2018-09-24 18:59:58 It depends on ideology. Britain taxed us against our consent, whilst exploiting our resources. Countries like pre-1953 Iran or pre-Chavez Venezuela weren't hostile to the US; they altered their oil exportation to us. In response, the CIA created violence in hopes of submission.
2399 2018-09-24 18:59:49 I diffused a fragrance oil at home today. Kid comes back from school and says, "it's nice, but I like the old smell better because when I smell it, I feel like I am back home and safe forever". The things kids notice...

Very depressed valuations in my opinion. Oil price soaring only widens the valuation gap
2401 2018-09-24 18:59:16 Car is in the shop getting an oil change and I locked myself out of the house. Got into my backyard but that's about as far as I could make it. So now I guess we chill till my car is finished. (it's too hot to justify walking a mile again just to get my house keys)
2402 2018-09-24 18:59:06 I hate being broke. I went in for an oil change and ended up needing a new battery and now my card is declining. Shit's embarrassing.
2403 2018-09-24 18:58:58 thank you! I use tea tree oil so far but I'll try the others 
2404 2018-09-24 18:58:58 And my favourite is (garlic+green chilly) chutney , sometimes add 2-3 drops of mustard oil into it !!
2405 2018-09-24 18:58:50 i need a new thc oil for my pen... who know somebody that know somebody?? lol
2406 2018-09-24 18:58:50 Oil changes at @gordonchevrolet are my fav bc they have so many snacks in the Lounge 
2407 2018-09-24 18:58:28 I’m gonna treat myself after work to an oil treatment while I study for my psych exam

2409 2018-09-24 18:58:18 I think it’s hilarious how many people think coconut oil is good for your hair
2410 2018-09-24 18:58:12 That’s it Donald! Soak the heartland with crude oil and destroy the underground water reserves ! Genius !
2411 2018-09-24 18:58:10 B12. Peppermint oil, vitamin E, Thyme oil. Tea Tree oil. Black seed oil. Rosemary oil. Lavender oil. All can assist

2413 2018-09-24 18:57:40 We don’t need to increase capacity for the purpose of shipping oil to Asia and turning Vancouver into an oil shipping port. Our tourism industry, employing men and women equally...is far more important than putting oil in boats...and most likely into the water.
2414 2018-09-24 18:57:39 You're another one looking for Fame & Fortune while peddling Snake Oil and Wingnuttery...

2417 2018-09-24 18:57:33 That oil money does not play. Emirates been winning since they came up with ICE. Also their planes are the coziest, especially closer to the cockpit. Never tried BA mainly because they got rid of the concorde.
2418 2018-09-24 18:57:32 Let's keep injecting chemicals into deep drill dives in search for crude oil under the Arctic. The crust is not a closed system. It leaks. You inject and it'll eventually surface. Pressure finds like electric charge, and like all forces the path of least resistance.
2419 2018-09-24 18:57:30 Ok, but what about all those oil tankers and ships, and that refinery?  And, all those boaters out there polluting the bay?  and don't forget those outfalls...

2423 2018-09-24 18:57:14 This great news for shareholders, but also great for those taking fish oil supplements. I've been taking them for years, and they (combined with diet and exercise) have reduced my LDL and triglycerides substantially.
2424 2018-09-24 18:57:14 Lmfao got an oil change, went to the car wash, cleaned my car and what do I do? Lock my keys and all of my belongings in there so I had to ask the guys working if I could borrow a phone how embarrassing
2425 2018-09-24 18:56:46 All are liars all were the liars. Nothing to do with wmd but Just to destabilize iraq and loot oil and gas.

2430 2018-09-24 18:55:50 Investment firms like Trafigura and JPMorgan want an economic downturn and market crash. They can cause it by raising oil prices. They are doing it.
2431 2018-09-24 18:55:47 #Amarin $AMRN got approval for "fish-oil derived" drug which has beneficial effects of, believe it or not, FISH OIL.  But the drug costs $2400 per year. The real fish oil I take costs about $14 per month.  In tests, the placebo contained mineral oil., really bad stuff. Placebo!?
2432 2018-09-24 18:55:42 What you suffered for a few days is what less prominent conservative citizens suffer every day. The social platforms should be broken up in much the same fashion the Standard of Oil of New Jersey was ordered to break up.

2440 2018-09-24 18:55:09 There are no business titans at the table.  The US President is modern snake oil salesman who has yet to be a success at anything, outside of selling garbage to idiots.
2441 2018-09-24 18:55:03 The CIA knew operatives that knew where Bin Laded was hiding, they didn't do shit, and kept hidden information from the FBI, Bush decided to invade Iraq, for one thing, they're Oil, same reason we're still in Afghanistan, but for their opium and minerals

2451 2018-09-24 18:53:39 Oil price soon 95 $ per barrel !
2452 2018-09-24 18:53:39 I wasn’t the one who claimed you were being paid by Big Oil, that would imply your analysis had any consistency or merit to be valuable for them. They probably want you bitter losers to ease off a bit, makes them look desperate.
2453 2018-09-24 18:53:22 My face has so much oil all the time, i think i can run a factory with it.

2462 2018-09-24 18:52:04 You're charming and reasonable.

They can get their oil from US suppliers.

And I don't need the TransMountain pipeline for my fuel because I live in Calgary.

And I have no problem opposing and export pipeline.
2463 2018-09-24 18:51:59 How about Global Warming or is that no on your oil friend’s agenda!
2464 2018-09-24 18:51:54 I'm a boy of IRAN. Shame on you and your king and your FM and your culture. We have a great history and great culture. You shouldn't compared your culture with us. You have very low level in culture. You just have oil. Any people in the world hate of your country.
2465 2018-09-24 18:51:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! ABC’s Lost was a secret documentary! It’s all true! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

I use Aussie products & biosilk oil if y'all were wondering lol But yea, he was kinda weird 
2469 2018-09-24 18:51:46 @TheDarthTrader Tempted to agree but pessimism reigns supreme in the Canadian drilling space. Pipelines, US refinery downtime, oil diffs
2470 2018-09-24 18:50:39 Perhaps a little, although I'm an oil painter, not a wonderful watercolourist, as was Burchfield.
2471 2018-09-24 18:50:33 Perhaps I need to staple my brain to the table. I sit there and think 'Ooh - I have never done that angle before - that would be a good idea...' Then hey presto lots of long days later I have another oil painting complete 
2472 2018-09-24 18:50:30 Not oil drilling for you, or oilfield work at all?
2473 2018-09-24 18:50:26 Oh yeah, I’m your lawyer. Mine would be a thankless task. Won’t charge u. Only a token .. Rs: 1.
But promise, shall burn the proverbial midnight oil.. work day in and day out... leave no stone unturned... make every effort. To set u free. Love
2474 2018-09-24 18:50:23 All I will say is that when people realize these trade wars are slowing down the global economy, oil will go with the markets, it usually does.
2475 2018-09-24 18:50:19 BREAKING: Today The Trump administration rolled back Obama's oil train safety rule That Would have required trains carrying crude oil to use special brakes with new technology.

 This makes no sense This was A SAFETY rule for trains carrying crude oil
2476 2018-09-24 18:50:16 TIP; use a sock filled with rice as heating pad. i make them by taking a sock and adding rice & lavender oil. then you’re going to microwave that for 40-60 seconds and its godly.
2477 2018-09-24 18:50:03 @SoreenHQ I've seen that you say your palm oil is from sustainable sources, what do you mean by sustainable and why isn't this on your packaging?
2478 2018-09-24 18:49:57 Lucas Oil Campout was the bomb!! The Lucas support staff was awesome. Honestly one of the best race events I have gone to. You guys need to do this for NHRA as well!! Thanks!!

2480 2018-09-24 18:49:33 I see nothing in the article recommending any oil other then olive & butter.  Anyone can get recipes from Spain, Italy & Greece on the internet, showing the native ingrediants.  What is your problem with this piece??
2481 2018-09-24 18:49:29 I urge @BronzeBomber & @Tyson_Fury to just ignore the snake oil salesman @EddieHearn He's butt hurt that the 2 best heavyweights are fighting Dec. 1st in LA. Let him make AJ vs Whyte II & sucker the Brits into paying for another $hit-show

2484 2018-09-24 18:48:43 I don't have an edge at the moment, I like that oil is a wedge between iran and russia, russia won't mind stepping up production to fill sanction hole in iran if it's enforced, who stops iran if they sell to china? OPEC talk is squishy, rig counts low enuf, can we fill hole?
2485 2018-09-24 18:48:41 Before it was all about sugar, then oil and now fruits!! Next Kenyans shall be turned to robots!! What's happening in Kenya? Where are we heading to?
2486 2018-09-24 18:48:37 #ntog Matt im pretty sure everyone knows what the oil price is doin as its rather insulting that u feel the need 2 update us on a commodity that we’ve invested our hard earned in. What we don’t know is wtf u’re doing;False dawns, empty promises.. looking like a lifestyle company.
2487 2018-09-24 18:48:32 Meu medo é uma crise global c/ o fim do ciclo americano por esgotamente,puxando o freio de mao da china em conjunto e depois UE. Uma queda de demanda da China leva uma queda doa preço do Minerio e Oil, até porque US vai ficar autossuficiente em Oil até 2020.
2488 2018-09-24 18:48:29 Good news ... Health Canada has banned "the main source of artifical trans fats in the Canadian diet"... North Prairie Gold is a non-GMO cold Pressed Canola Oil that low in saturated fat - even lower than oIive oil. Try some today and taste the difference!
2489 2018-09-24 18:48:18 Nigeria 14th largest producer of oil in the world.
1. Technology zero
2. Agricultural zero
3. Education zero
4. Security zero

WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IN THIS COUNTRY?
2490 2018-09-24 18:48:05 2/2 Preserve the right for women to have control of their bodies. Preserve protections for LGBT. Conservation? Let’s hear you speak against roll-backs by the EPA. Let Native Americans preserve their lands against oil and gas industries.
2491 2018-09-24 18:48:02 Thanks for the on the ground intel.  Panama made initial steps to launch a deep sea oil exploration license round in 2006 that also did not launch, wondering if this is round 2.  I see the energy minister is scheduled to speak at PetroPan, but no other named or confirmed guests.
2492 2018-09-24 18:47:55 @Powerlunch @Amarincorp 
Fish oil is a DRUG now?!
BWAHAHAHAHAH!!!!
2493 2018-09-24 18:47:51 Sitting in a chair? 

Under which section of the Nigerian constitution? 
@oil_shaeikh ko dai an baka rijiyar mai ne kaima?
2494 2018-09-24 18:47:47 I’d like to know when recipes could be printed in newspapers and magazines and specify “oil” or “cooking oil” rather than “salad oil.”

I don’t care enough to do any research, though.
2495 2018-09-24 18:47:28 Like ordinary castor oil?
2496 2018-09-24 18:47:27 Foundation, Eliot ever tasted oil.
2497 2018-09-24 18:47:19 My personal fav is Fritz European fry house, just off Granville. However, La Brasserie does an amazing breakfast poutine with poached eggs, hollandaise, and truffle oil.

Locus has a good poutine as well, with wild boar.
2498 2018-09-24 18:47:11 Something that isn't meant for art. Nail polish? Have you painted with coffee yet? Have you tried oil pastels?
2499 2018-09-24 18:47:09 I’ll send you a CBD oil & a couple samples of the Arnica Pain Reliever for some topical relief. :)
2500 2018-09-24 18:47:05 People always ask me why I change my own oil and rotate my own tires and shit like that it’s because im not a dummy and my pops an aircraft mechanic nigga be getting mad every time someone take they car to the shop
2501 2018-09-24 18:47:05 We give way too much credit to the Conservatives destroying the economy or the NDP turning the economy around. The economy is where it is for 2 reasons: the reduction in and recovery of oil prices, and the discount taken for the manner oil is delivered to market.
2502 2018-09-24 18:46:54 Lol they're a freelance reporters
2503 2018-09-24 18:46:40 When will they be detaining the ex-president because he himself embezzled many more millions. All the roque oil deals and then the diamond deals are not even mentioned. Angola was dos Santos family business for yeas.
2504 2018-09-24 18:46:31 Alright brother. But I fear beefing up security involves a ground war somewhere for oil company interests. But you’re right, if democrats actually get serious on domestic issues, I’ll always be there to vote. Hell, endorse Medicare For All and you probably got my vote.
2505 2018-09-24 18:46:22 We are not in a tariff war with China. If China wanted to, they could put a substantial tariff on US oil. They don't need our oil. There are enough resources available to them from Iran and Venezuela. They can build electric cars and build alternative transportation systems.
2506 2018-09-24 18:46:14 “Stop hating on my new ride” - Some oil tycoon in Texas.
2507 2018-09-24 18:46:12 I can do lots of things at the same time: Follow Kavanaugh, follow Rosenstein/Mueller, follow the VA privitization plan, follow the UN focus on world wide drug usage, follow the Native American land oil spill, follow PR, Flint. And oh yes..I haven't forgotten concentration camps.
2508 2018-09-24 18:46:00 If not for me these nations would be ten years behind in the oil industry I started the honey oil Industry in Canada before people even believed it existed now everyone is acting to be expert ha make me laugh most products are Shit low grade and reused product wake up
2509 2018-09-24 18:45:59 Because oil execs don't value your safety and they have Trump's ear?
2510 2018-09-24 18:45:37 But doesn't listen to the experts on oil and gas. @nzlabour @jacindaardern
#hypocrisyawarenessweek
2511 2018-09-24 18:45:30 Try mixing your product with Castor Oil or Olive oil.
2512 2018-09-24 18:44:57 We know that climate change means more and more extreme weather events, so with some regions flooding and others in drought, why don’t we build water pipeline infrastructure, comparable but healthier than oil pipelines?!!  What am I missing that we haven’t done this already?
2513 2018-09-24 18:44:49 Power oil to bad gan
2514 2018-09-24 18:44:31 Oil Prices have hit a four-year high of $81 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia rejected calls by Donald Trump to increase production.
2515 2018-09-24 18:44:26 "Jodie Whittaker" is from Yorkshire so will probably talk like this. "Nah then Dalek stop mithering me with thi gravelly 'Exterminate', tha's no Barry White n what's coming outta thi cake'ole is hurting me lug 'oil luv. Sit thissen down n tek weight of thi wheels cos I'm mashin'
2516 2018-09-24 18:44:21 The USA should make a great deal with all the Cameroons, French and English , give them the opportunities and prosperity . They won't mind some of this wealth and oil to flow to Americans .
2517 2018-09-24 18:44:15 Might have something to do with switching from the $ to the € for oil trading. Such actions threaten to show up the US Dollar for its worthlessness.
2518 2018-09-24 18:44:15 to usando bio oil e parece que temos uma menina nova me encarando no espelho
2519 2018-09-24 18:44:12 somebody wanna pay for my oil change, inspection, taxes and new tags?????????
2520 2018-09-24 18:44:10 Vegetables oil
2521 2018-09-24 18:44:05 What is she desperate about?  Frost is going to kill her tomatoes?   Her grandkids won’t go to bed? Her car needs an oil change?  Seriously, give it a rest . . .
2522 2018-09-24 18:43:57 Use coconut oil is better 
2523 2018-09-24 18:43:56 Maybe something has to burst, but I don't think it will be oil; it it does, I am very bullish on the post short term collapse if further global capex spending is reigned in on.
2524 2018-09-24 18:43:55 If fish oil is worth 7-8B$ you should check out GW Pharma
2525 2018-09-24 18:43:50 This is a treasonable felony
2526 2018-09-24 18:43:46 Marijuana and tobacco are only comparable in the fact that they are smoked. That's it. And cannabis oil with zero thc can be taken in a number of different ways and is a great alternative to pain and anxiety medications. Stop being so short sighted and naive.
2527 2018-09-24 18:43:45 WTI OIL FUTURES LOG HIGHEST FINISH SINCE JULY 10 [MW]
2528 2018-09-24 18:43:39 Did he mention he was selling off mineral and oil interest in order to do this "wonderful" thing? Selling off mining rights and our land in order to fund this #fixourparks He's so full of shit and you should be ashamed of yourself for falling for his bullshit. Don't be so naive!
2529 2018-09-24 18:43:31 I'm jk bruh. But the cantu has castor oil in it
2530 2018-09-24 18:43:26 Is Zinke trying to rewrite the constitution? We the people not We the oil and gas industry. This is corruption.

#cronycapitalism
2531 2018-09-24 18:43:26 How about an "Oil and Gas Workers Equality Week" where we all celebrate the vast contributions of the oil and gas industry to the Canadian economy; and where we commit to economic policies which support exploration, development, sale and shipment of our oil & gas reserves!
2532 2018-09-24 18:43:20 How my car shop experiences always go:

Me: Hi, I'd like to get an oil change.

Clerk: Alright we will have it ready for you soon.

20 minutes later ...

Mechanic: Is this your car sir?

Me: Yes ... What's wrong with it? 

Thankfully this time, it's an air filter lol
2533 2018-09-24 18:43:19 yeo, I should have said energy stocks - I trade a few but I rarely get into long term holding of them. I probably should but $80 oil looks rather high to me when the market thought $50 would be a struggle for some time.
2534 2018-09-24 18:43:13 BTW Sunflower oil ന്‌ എന്താ കുഴപ്പം..??
2535 2018-09-24 18:43:11 Not oil but cigs. and guns...all I can get!
2536 2018-09-24 18:43:10 Evangelicals Dominionists w help from “Christian” Russia are setting sights on control of the GOP, control of all branches of Gov including SCOTUS. And one way or the other, $100+oil via peace or war. Can almost hear them grinding their teeth for the “glorious” endtimes.
2537 2018-09-24 18:43:07 Colorado did that to me! Even since moving back here my skin is just permanently different. Luckily I found a facial cleansing oil there that seemed to protect my face from the dry pretty well, but my skin was constantly peeling for a while before that. Dry air can suck it.
2538 2018-09-24 18:43:03 positive fish oil studies is the new thing $AMRN $STUDY
2539 2018-09-24 18:42:50 Eh mana, ba sauki ai

2544 2018-09-24 18:42:42 For all you girls that are uneducated, olive oil removes makeup and is all natural. You’re welcome 
2545 2018-09-24 18:42:40 Madam bechari kia karey. Bottle mein jo Olive oil aur honey tha woh pee kr aain hein. Iss liey aisi baatein kar rahi hein.

2551 2018-09-24 18:42:20 Sunh Fish is the ONLY place I buy seafood! I really loved their Atlantic salmon for the fattiness, and when in season, the Alaskan Halibut is always perfect for searing hard on the stove in olive oil, then finish in the oven.
2552 2018-09-24 18:42:13 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2553 2018-09-24 18:42:12 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2554 2018-09-24 18:42:01 Crude oil prices were ahead, Brent jumped to $81.05/ bbl on OPEC’s rejection of US president Donald Trump’s suggestion that OPEC drive down crude oil prices quickly

2561 2018-09-24 18:41:19 So when the car dealer says about an hour for an oil change, that's really code for two hours....
2562 2018-09-24 18:41:13 Everything in our culture runs on oil.  One of every three calories of food is grown using fossil fuels.  Even in Hydro-rich Manitoba, a small amount of our electricity comes from fossil fuels.  You've identified the problem, Idiot, not the solution.
2563 2018-09-24 18:41:11 I don't mind spiders but I hear they don't like lemon, eucalyptus or peppermint oil - all of which smell ACE!
2564 2018-09-24 18:41:11 Amazing company that will be affected by higher oil prices in the short run. Movements towards recycling efforts and eco friendly packaging will be highly valued by investors
2565 2018-09-24 18:41:09 Morality and politics are like oil and water but when push comes to shove things will be said @GeorgeMsumba @edmnangagwa @nelsonchamisa @DMwonzora @NewsDayZimbabwe @elias_mambo @akunambura

2567 2018-09-24 18:40:45 I like the idea of dilettante oil - doesn't quite fit, though.
2568 2018-09-24 18:40:44 Over 92% of our oil revenue? What? You poor fool.

We raise in taxes (including all oil tax revenue) substantially less than we spend. That shortfall is currently met by taxpayers in the rest of the UK. Cold, hard, facts.
2569 2018-09-24 18:40:37 we all know when the 45th president breathes heavily, more than one earthling has brainfreeze #impeach

2581 2018-09-24 18:40:01 Let the government before increases oil products first fight corruption by its root even if they add up vat the same cash will go to pocket of selfish corrupt individual who just water and air to the government  ie agrass of water at 200 per litre a pen for 100 a PC etc
2582 2018-09-24 18:40:01 my dad used to always do my oil changes and one day he was like oh you can just take it to jiffy lube and I was sooo shook.
2583 2018-09-24 18:39:57 There were two proposals - Blacks and one more.  Black would have used undiluted bitumen. Trouble was, they were for export, not for use in BC and used Alberta oil, not BC oil.  We should be looking at niche prodn, not trying to compete with heavily subsidized US refineries.
2584 2018-09-24 18:39:52 I love garlic tofu. You need firm tofu for this. Cut the tofu into cubes and marinate it in a mix of hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and garlic for 30 min. Then cook it in a pan with oil for about 5 min on each side until it’s browned then serve over rice.
2585 2018-09-24 18:39:49 Must make it a extra naughty one then .... #OilFans #Oil #XRated #PhoneSex
2586 2018-09-24 18:39:28 you can stay on that high moral ground of not using oil money all you want but the moral high ground doesn't win you trophies
2587 2018-09-24 18:39:26 Honestly speaking @jkenney, ( I am a Geo-scientist & a social worker through different volunteer orgs)-I never believed that a person sitting on opposition benches with meagre monetary resources will take the Alberta Oil battle right into the NDP and Trudeau barracks. Kudos !
2588 2018-09-24 18:39:11 spx down 35 bps - imgaqine how much higher we would be with 30 % tariffs and 120 oil
2589 2018-09-24 18:39:06 I should get a dollar from every gram of oil sold in Canada and the us for starting the market and being ignored and kicked out only to be copyrighted or I could send out my armies to destroy them and take all that would be more efficient my armies do not break rank

2593 2018-09-24 18:38:37 trump is in a trade war w/ China because China will buy Iran's oil and pay in yuan, so Iran will spend it buying Chinese goods.

In other words: trump screwed up bigly.

And no end of snake oil sales folk looking to sell a pained up search engine or dashboard.
2597 2018-09-24 18:38:26 @ZenwiseHealth What is the ratio of oil to powder in your C8 powder?  Obviously more oil to powder is best.. And do you source your oil from sustainable sources?

2610 2018-09-24 18:37:00 In the extreme conditions 0W-40 is an acceptable oil.  Either synthetic or petroleum based.
2611 2018-09-24 18:36:53 Only a dumb politician of uneducated RJD herd can put this type of fools logic. In oil industry we were purchasing Basic unit for Rs 10 crores and the tools to be attached were costing Rs 40 crores. Then only the unit was called fully functional. Talking like a fool Jha ji?

2617 2018-09-24 18:36:31 I never had sensitive skin before, but now like random things freak it out? Like I can use all sorts of things with perfume in them on my face, or retinoids like Luna oil, but regular cleansers will just make it flip out
2618 2018-09-24 18:36:26 Can’t you just eat flax seed oil and get the same amount of omega sixes without having to kill the fish?
2619 2018-09-24 18:36:26 Have you tried hand feeding from your palm
If you make beef stew or chicken soup mix the gravy or broth in with the kibble to soften and flavor it and add some of the meat and veg on top to entice. 
Carrots sauteed in coconut oil on the food is good for them too.
2620 2018-09-24 18:36:13 Agreed. I'd like to see all B.C. oil refineries revived and maybe a new one added in Stewart but I sense from decades of watching it that tax and regulatory regimes in #bcpoli tend to harm the investment climate for them, not to mention predictable howls from green snowflakes.
2621 2018-09-24 18:36:10 In the past the trade of  sugar, cotton and other goods of the like consisted of a large portion of the economy. This industry also used slave labor as well as violence to succeed. Now oil and technology are much more important today...... pt 1 #ineedmorespace #AuburnWorldHistory
2622 2018-09-24 18:35:50 I feel for you, you need to get in this oil tho. I
2623 2018-09-24 18:35:36 This is a gas field, not oil.
2624 2018-09-24 18:35:24 Omg they’re playing Midnight Oil songs on the island of Spetses! #Spetses #Greece #Australia
2625 2018-09-24 18:35:07 Congress is unable to capitalise on the real issues like rising oil prices, falling rupee, farmers deaths and many core issues which are bleeding the common man of this country. When people want the oppositions support for any just cause, they are not found. 1/2
2626 2018-09-24 18:35:05 Yup. Term limits are populist snake oil.

2628 2018-09-24 18:34:57 I think it's like using truffle oil. Would the food have been delicious without it? Yes, but a foodie will notice and appreciate the effort. 

Russian trolling has that special something that makes the target believe that victory is lurking behind the next meme.
2629 2018-09-24 18:34:53 @trend_bullish if they drain their inventories it will lead to stronger demand and more desperation in the late medium to long term, supply won't respond to declining oil outlook aside from cutting back.
2630 2018-09-24 18:34:45 Oil price at its in highest level since 2014,Bad news for us,I predicted that petrol price will be R18 a liter by December
2631 2018-09-24 18:34:41 Oil line from PG to Kamloops remains intact and serviceable. Tank farm and connection to TM as well to supply lower mainland with some BC oil. Wells drilled in the past couple years at Boundary Lk and Laguard are some of the most prolific in BC history.
2632 2018-09-24 18:34:37 Wick drill is next.  1/4 Billion barrels of oil in Moray Firth.   Strike will hit the headlines soon.

2635 2018-09-24 18:34:35 I started the oil industry in #Canada no one would look at me #hightimes ignored me now acting out expertise of the same no different from the #government I had to set the price at 40g when I flooded the market with only two pounds of #honeyoil more than ten years ago #hypocrites
2636 2018-09-24 18:34:28 $PKD recent r/s  low float (like $ALT $SAEX ) and Oil&gas (like $PED $JONE $YUMA ,...) maybe can run
2637 2018-09-24 18:34:20 Is cod liver oil the same?
2638 2018-09-24 18:33:49 American-Israeli-Saudi objectives in Syria include: regime change, balkanization, Israeli expansion, the withdrawal of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, depopulation, a permanent US military presence and the securing of oil fields and pipeline routes.
2639 2018-09-24 18:33:48 Hmm. Browsers are an interesting example. 

Weird thing about tech is how the best products usually dominate the market. As such, you’d probably have to keep breaking up the biggest browser every 5–10 years?

It’s not like the days of Standard Oil!

2642 2018-09-24 18:33:04 True in a way; it can possibly help, especially terminally ill patients & nothing else works; proven in certain seizure conditions (CBD oil) & of course THC artificial made form (marinol) for chemo induced nausea.  Only thing is for smoke type, the smoke is more harmful than cigs

2650 2018-09-24 18:31:33 Canada, too, sells them significant weaponry. They would be stopped by the West if it were not for oil and exports.

2652 2018-09-24 18:31:14 They figured out a way to determine "extreme poverty" by counting the amount of calories a person had access to per day. And then imported shitloads of subsidized palm oil and dumped it on the people before the surveys were done. /#conspiracyTheory
2653 2018-09-24 18:31:03 BC does have some domestic oil production but most of #bcpoli's most valuable wells involve natural gas, espy deep natural gas liquids aka diluent. Alberta is the king of oil, by far.

2662 2018-09-24 18:29:54 I've put on so much oil & lotion in an attempt to rehydrate my skin & hair after 3 days of drying wind & sand that if anyone tries to hug me today, I'll slip right out of their arms like a bar of soap
2663 2018-09-24 18:29:47 This is happening to me today! I haven’t worn makeup all last week due a sinus infection and I decided to for today. My face is an oil slick even though I used a mattifying primer
2664 2018-09-24 18:29:46 There’s a quarter of a billion barrel of oil test drill happening shortly off the Wick coast.  Will hit the headlines over the next few weeks.  Shares in the companies involved will rocket.
2665 2018-09-24 18:29:34 New York Post (J.Tobin) ...Trump’s Iran sanctions are working—something the establishment critics once again got wrong. “The success of oil sanctions should not only encourage the United States to push Tehran harder. It’s also one more reason to ignore the so-called experts..."

2671 2018-09-24 18:29:15 10/10 recommend although you have gorgeous skin love!!!  I’m still a lil red and flaky but nothing unmanageable. Been drenching my skin in hyaluronic acid + coconut oil + taking collagen to help with the cell turnover process. I’m doing 2 more sessions in the next 10 weeks
2672 2018-09-24 18:29:14 I remember when @BarackObama hated oil... $2 gas...

Glad I have my @Tesla model 3!
2673 2018-09-24 18:29:07 Norway has that deal because it has a small population and loads of oil. Otherwise it would be a full member.
2674 2018-09-24 18:29:05 @KimKardashian I bought the @ABHcosmetics hydrating oil nice reco! It smells so good and relaxing too  good call 
2675 2018-09-24 18:29:01 I’m shocked bud. It’s not like I made him carry an oil boiler on his back!
2676 2018-09-24 18:28:45 Thankyou for being the leading champion for oil and gas and for energy in the United States Senate and making your number one priority jobs. We want more jobs, we want higher wages, we want more opportunity.

2683 2018-09-24 18:27:55 This weekend I changed my own oil, valves cover gaskets and rewired my windows. Why the fuck am I single?
2684 2018-09-24 18:27:54 Research west of Shetland gas and oil fields. U.K. is rich in resource. Forget project fear we will be ok. Not on sky news but we are fine. We must leave EU
2685 2018-09-24 18:27:53 Just read that Saudi Arabia sees a growth for crude oil in their forecasts. We have done nothing to reduce carbon dioxide and methane. All efforts have been symbolic gestures while co2 has actually increased.

2686 2018-09-24 18:27:44 @nestednaturals I love that you use acacia fiber in your #MCT powder.  What is the % of C8?  Also what is the oil to powder ratio?  Upwards of 80-90% would be fabulous.  Looking for that stand out product because so many r subpar in their own ways.
2687 2018-09-24 18:27:35 investment sounds like further genocide. Reminds me of Sawarak. Palm oil "development" because death sentence of orang asli
2688 2018-09-24 18:27:04 Any small black owned businesses have a face oil you guys recommend?
2689 2018-09-24 18:26:38 yeah true i hear that. but i just mean maybe we should switch it up and focus on getting off oil and growing more real food and getting away from Chemicals in food and pumping out medication. its all politics and about filling wallets
2690 2018-09-24 18:26:24 fish oil is still something?
2691 2018-09-24 18:26:20 haha you must be long wondering why it's not going up. Cod Liver Oil Generic version 99% cheaper 99% the same. Don't believe the hype

2698 2018-09-24 18:25:35 $HPR down 2.5% on a day when oil is way up and the sector is way up is a bad sign. Please tell me why I'm wrong! Ready to unwind a loss on this one.
2699 2018-09-24 18:25:34 Trump saw the oil and is coming to invade your house
2700 2018-09-24 18:25:12 At this point there is probably no saving NASCAR now.... Damage is done.

He at least will no longer be on the throne. There’s a huge wall of bullshit he’s done since he took charge thus destroying his family’s creation. The DUI was just a lighter match to an oil ocean.
2701 2018-09-24 18:25:09 So their lying about the oil price and emerging markets currencies? Ignorance. Smh
2702 2018-09-24 18:25:08 Today was the first and last time I pay over $55 for an oil change.
2703 2018-09-24 18:25:04 Man these oil stocks are giving me an unexplainable joy lmao
2704 2018-09-24 18:25:04 This is a total classic!! The most fun was loading up corners with oil slicks followed by mines, heheheh 
2705 2018-09-24 18:24:54 He got nothing but a judgement which she will never pay. I have 3 of them over a decade old from people that sued me for phoney claims of business  transactions they defaulted on and I won cases. Reason they sued, I had more than they did, and they wanted it.

You will of course have no currency or any money from the rest of the uk....
Not to mention most of the oil and gas is in uk waters not scotish ones including the new1tr cubic tonne field ....

2720 2018-09-24 18:23:18 You have not hurt anyone in your journey except yourself because mentally we destroy ourselves.  You are not alone as I and most struggle with this.  You are great young man and I am proud of you.  Take your CBD OIL daily.  Love Dad

2724 2018-09-24 18:22:41 With those two, it’s more likely you’re discussing how to sell off our remaining natural lands, Utah’s most prized and irreplaceable possessions, to oil, gas, and mining.
2725 2018-09-24 18:22:36 This mans a walking oil slick.
2726 2018-09-24 18:22:28 This was always known - if a little unpublicised secret, though always on Wikipedia.  I assume they high gravity brew the local lager and then blend with the extract.  I met a guy who had some responsibility in Africa once who said it used to arrive in “oil drums”
2727 2018-09-24 18:22:22 Fake news, you said the oil was running out
2728 2018-09-24 18:22:14 Are you constipated? It my be that you are blocked up a bit. Try water, miralax or smooth move tea. If it is affecting your appetite try sucking on frozen grapes before you eat. Potato and sweet potatoes are really good but don't add fat(oil/ butter)just cook in oven w/spices.

2733 2018-09-24 18:21:58 A generous amount of oil and some soy sauce is the key ;)
2734 2018-09-24 18:21:43 Oddly enough our school in Broomfield gave their money back and we had teachers saying they deserve better money, not based on a Ponzi scheme. We have firefighters and teachers canvassing for their health & safety. PS- severance taxes from oil and gas aren’t as high as they say.

2744 2018-09-24 18:21:04 Same as in 2008, when they were calling for $200 oil.

2751 2018-09-24 18:20:28 After seeing the effect of his tweet on crude oil,  Trump should ask for high prices next time if he want them down. His tweets have reverse effect on oil

I'm hoping its just hoses but I have a sneaking suspicion that theres some oil leakage as well because the puddle under my car when I got back from vacay was greem/brown

2758 2018-09-24 18:19:43 Ooooooo - I downloaded Mojave but … can’t quite apply it yet. This is like the potsticker torture: when they bring your potstickers w/out the hot oil and vinegar or your chopsticks…
2759 2018-09-24 18:19:38 I want a leader whose focus is on improving the standard of living that all Canadians strive for.  Compelling unemployed oil&gas workers to vote @Alberta_UCP and their abhorrent social ideology into power because, having a job has to come before the rights of others? No thanks.

2762 2018-09-24 18:19:11 What are the factors for recession?
Crude oil, Re Depreciation, big headeche of insolvency of IL&FS,  selling in index and cash market, dollar index, recession in rest of the world like Turkey, Iran,  Trade war in US and China

2768 2018-09-24 18:18:36 I am suggesting nothing.
Merely pointing out that burning is not the only use for oil.

Naturally I agree we can’t burn it all, and certainly not at current rates of consumption.

I think we will continue to extract oil albeit at reduced volumes but soon nobody will be burning it
2769 2018-09-24 18:18:36 Oil @ $80 a barrel Poor Norway, what are they going to do with the extra money? Scotland is so lucky to have Westminster take that problem away.

2773 2018-09-24 18:18:04 yup sure do...with massage oil!!!
2774 2018-09-24 18:17:58 Yes, PLEASE protect our lands from the GREEDY oil companies that will "ruin" the peoples land! 
2775 2018-09-24 18:17:54 I deadass was destroying my own hair, at a point i was losing hair, no lie. And i started taking vitamins and using keratin shampoos and conditioners with argan oil and moroccon oils. Got leave-in spray, and it literally fixed my shit. And now im starting to grow my hair out.
2776 2018-09-24 18:17:50 That's the one! Matt commented about Lisa liking it.  I remain dubious. I do miss Lick's chocolate and olive oil one! that was delicious!

2786 2018-09-24 18:16:46 Oil prices hit 4-year high after OPEC rebuffs Trump http I thought we were supposed to have achieved energy independence with crude and natural gas, so why are prices so steep ???
2787 2018-09-24 18:16:44 Who's fucking artificially raise oil price?As a Pr.Trump said-oil price should LOW.
Let's reduce price -RIGHT NOW!
2788 2018-09-24 18:16:42 I’m just really proud of myself for finally getting my oil changed today. Only about 6k miles overdue.  #mightneedanewenginetoo

2790 2018-09-24 18:16:16 We will cope, we won’t benefit other than a couple of scraps for local jobs and never ending Scottish Lib Dem press interviews. That oil wouldn’t have been discovered in an Indy Scotland
2791 2018-09-24 18:15:56 Is it still logical to say for instance; "oil producing countries" for a naturally occurring resource? Its not like we mixing factors of production to continue producing. Leave out the value addition bit. The correct narrative should be "oil depleting countries". No?
2792 2018-09-24 18:15:53 I live near an oil upgrader. They vent and the whole city smells like burnt dinosaur ass. I instead will cuddle up with kitties and smell their awesome fur.

2796 2018-09-24 18:15:11 People sleep on mayo. Cooking with it leaves a nice crust and seals in moisture. The flavor is usually cooked away or is just there a little bit. Olive oil is still number one

2800 2018-09-24 18:15:04 Good question.

Extraction temp will be determined by what end result you want.
A room temp long duration soak will give lower THC, but much higher amounts of all other compounds, including chlorophyll.
A cold, or freezing temp shorter soak give a more golden oil with high THC.

2810 2018-09-24 18:13:26 In some form or way, it ALWAYS has been just like previously did with ISIS :))

AFAIK, or at least that was the way was done, oil goes to Iraq Kurdistan and from there to Turkey as "Iraq|i Kurdish" Oil.

An iPhone in Iran costs $7,000.00-$10,000.00, 1kg of tomato costs $4.00, 1kg chicken is $4.00 etc.
Iranian officials only today told people that S.Korea hasn't imported oil from Iran for 3 months.

2827 2018-09-24 18:11:46 When you hear the words auto maintenance, chances are you think of an oil change. However, while this is certainly correct, auto maintenance can also pertain to a number of things such as plug changes, air cleaner replacement and yes, even a good wash and wax.

Ginger or chamomile tea is also soothing
2890 2018-09-24 18:04:21 A man knows who his heart belongs to. So you can cook his food in Diamond oil & do backflips on his dick, but if it isn’t you, it just isn’t you

2892 2018-09-24 18:04:11 Hasn't it been known from well before 2014 that several oil/gas companies believed there were big untapped fields off West Shetland? 
2893 2018-09-24 18:04:06 #rheadd Technologies are absolutely politicized. As we discussed, oil companies pay for research into how damaging their product is to the environment and has all the power to choose which results get published. Companies that produce technologies all have an agenda.

2901 2018-09-24 18:02:27 Gorgeous!! Though, it looks more over easy to me? Sunny side usually means no white was cooked over the yolk, and the sides are super crispy. There’s lots of extra oil in the pan to cook the top without flipping. Sorry to be an /egg snob/ lol You did GREAT!
2902 2018-09-24 18:02:25 Sanctions on Iran and Russia , the destruction of Libya, Syria, Iraq ,   Its a mystery why we have high oil price     Morons
2903 2018-09-24 18:02:24 CBD oil Dulce!! that shit helped snap me out of an anxiety attack within minutes. Are you okay??
2904 2018-09-24 18:02:03 Hft financial terrorism. Qei  ii III is the biggest financial fraud in history. Apart from the staggering amounts of oil gold silver copper spiced fruit veg "commodities" = colonialism. How much UK resources in the ground? Slim pickings. Abroad? Unlimited. Print money.
2905 2018-09-24 18:02:00 Try some CBD oil, it does wonders for calming frazzles.  You'll prolly sleep better, too.  I didn't believe it until I tried it myself. Now, just pissed off and deterrmined the #TrumpCrimeFamily is held responsible for corrupt actions. I'd rather them be upset and sick, not me.
2906 2018-09-24 18:01:50 This is the new, improved, highly-purified, Industrial strength fish oil. Only a couple hundred  a month.

Convenient that cheesy ole OTC fish oil was laid to rest a short while back.
2907 2018-09-24 18:01:44 Yes but it don’t mean you old or anything just means you use your knees a lot add some coconut oil olive oil or oily type of supplement to your daily it help that
2908 2018-09-24 18:01:25 @realDonaldTrump 

Sorry, but u r not following a stop loss in Iran case as it is giving US n it's allies great loss, as oil prices up around at least 25 %, if no sanction applied, iran too is getting $30 profit on every unit oil sale, it will hv been $10 , if no sanction so if
2909 2018-09-24 18:01:15 Trudeau feels morally incapable of supporting Canada's oil trade and has decided to place all of his bets on legalizing recreational drugs.
2910 2018-09-24 18:01:08 Yes! It’s liquid gold, but the other things did help too. Especially the African black soap and vitamin e oil.
2911 2018-09-24 18:01:01 New cars are a lil different. Most use synthetic oil. If so, you can hit 6K miles before you change the oil.
2912 2018-09-24 18:01:00 Not everyone needs paid for their actions of kindness. Maybe some people want to help a business get through struggling times that is truly making an impact on our world, and is fighting limited funds and huge oil and auto industry companies who do whatever they can to stop them.
2913 2018-09-24 18:00:55 Have some ginger tea and do some steam inhalation w eucalyptus oil in it. You'll be fine.
2914 2018-09-24 18:00:52 I recommend looking further into the conversation.

Until you see the people he is referring to.

2918 2018-09-24 18:00:13 After work, I'm investing in a high frequency noise machine and peppermint oil for my car. Now I'm just hoping I don't find anymore friends, dead or alive, in my car. And hoping my friend from this morning didn't cause any damage or leave me any gifts

2921 2018-09-24 18:00:01 The bidding process was open to all that could afford to buy (even with loans) so no. Bad timing just hit their loan book which was exposed to oil & gas when prices crashed  RT @lafile @Rotankwot Should the regulators (CBN, SEC) have allowed Skye Bank take over Mainstream?
2922 2018-09-24 18:00:01 No, as long as you don’t overuse. Use after cleansing your face to moisturize. I use aloe soap to cleanse and then spray aloe, and then moisturize with the rose oil.

2927 2018-09-24 17:59:03 I have to go get an oil change today before work and I’m dreading it sooooo much 
2928 2018-09-24 17:58:55 @TamalBandyo when oil companies has not learnt till date how to manage thier currency payments , and govt did nothing also why blame other corporates for failure to do so ? We deliberately create our own crisis .

U.S. stock futures followed European and Asian shares lower in thin volume after China called off planned trade talks with the U.S. and the Trump administration imposed another $200 billion in "Phase II" China tariff
2941 2018-09-24 17:56:53 Yes! This is why we need more trust busting! The big trusts didn't end with ma bell and standard oil! 
Look at the 5 major social media companies! All run by leftists.

2942 2018-09-24 17:56:36 Y’all ytes wanna be funny and put corn in ur hair, try the hot oil treatment. It’s where you fry some oil and put it in your hair starting with your scalp. Be sure to leave it on for 30 min.

2956 2018-09-24 17:55:21 In Mumbai, petrol crossed Rs 90-mark for the first time ever. The fuel now costs Rs 90.08 at Indian Oil Corp (IOC) outlets in the city while it is priced at Rs 90.17 at Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) outlets and Rs 90.14 at Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) stations.

2972 2018-09-24 17:53:10 So you can make the claim all day that being principled in anti-illegal wars of aggression for oil makes @jimmy_dore Pro-Assad

But he cant accurately state that by cheering for US intervention in Syria it makes you Pro-Al Qaeda?

We are literally the air force for Al Qaeda

I know that hurts Turkey economy above all, BUT, some scheme to supply Oil at attractive prices should be in place to compensate Turkey from the loss of that STOLEN oil.

3026 2018-09-24 17:47:14 My eczema, esp around my inner elbows, keeps getting better and then back to shit, im so sick of this. Its unsightly but mainly it hurts due to irritation

i've been trying to use straight up vitamin e oil and idk if thats helping
3027 2018-09-24 17:47:11 Wait, wut?! I thought fish oil was just debunked! I give up.
3028 2018-09-24 17:47:06 Oil a growing concern in terms of its availability and price and also a major contributor to pollution, why aren't we thinking of nuclear energy to power cars and other automobiles. Can this be alternative for future?
3029 2018-09-24 17:47:00 lowest OS oil play, will hit $13++, we have an even bigger oil run happening then we had the last time this hit $13 + from these levels within days.
3030 2018-09-24 17:46:59 Doc: it looks like something is bothering you

Me: in the movie Speed 2, they activated the bow thrusters to avoid the oil tanker, but the ship went into the pier, it should have just kept turning and done circles at sea

Doc: look, just tell me what drugs you want and get out
3031 2018-09-24 17:46:50 Not to worry I am sure the oil industry Will pickup again.
3032 2018-09-24 17:46:47 Video games, being in a different world then the one we live on really helps.  
If I could afford oil paints I'd do that too I'm sure and or piano since mine broke so right now good ol' gaming.
3033 2018-09-24 17:46:45 S/A is totally pissed at him right now, I think he'll sell out our oil sands to Iran.

3035 2018-09-24 17:46:36 It is essential to curb imports  otherwise our Rupee will down further. in case of acute need of most essential item import aspect may be considered.oil consumption can also be reduced for which public transport use habit should be our routine.

3042 2018-09-24 17:45:55 leave it to a conservative to promote the separation of Canada. if you hate this great country so much you should move to one which puts oil industry priorities ahead of everything else the way you do, like venezuela. #sellout
3043 2018-09-24 17:45:54 I think they are curious if it reduced LDL-C or LDL-P.  Looking at the drug disclaimers it mentions that there might be a risk in increasing LDL-C.  Do any of the large RCTs ever document changes in LDL-P? Does fish oil reduce LDL-P?
3044 2018-09-24 17:45:52 THC % in oil is not a direct proportional amount to what the bud had.

The RSO I get is 55% THC, and have had much higher in home made batches.

Temperature and soaking time are more of a factor. 
3045 2018-09-24 17:45:46 Getting an oil change like an adult. Changing my air filter like an adult. I've already spent over half of Friday's paycheck like an adult.
3046 2018-09-24 17:45:31 I should probably look into getting cbd oil.

3056 2018-09-24 17:43:48 Why u Guys believe all this propaganda crap? Not worth your effort . All this outlets are oil and war corporations megaphones . Have you seen recently any polls asking people what they really wAnt? Exactly . This is brain washing 1 on 1 .
3057 2018-09-24 17:43:37 No one knows the price I said last year oil fair value 75-80 which works for everyone. A short spurt to 85 won’t damage but long term can create wreckless spending and demand destruction if we go 90+
3058 2018-09-24 17:43:08 Hot oil...
3059 2018-09-24 17:43:04 Getting my oil changed and Dr. Oz is on. So far I’ve learned that lettuce is safe to eat again (thank god. finally!) via a highly staged and drawn out segment. Kill me (poison lettuce).

3061 2018-09-24 17:42:57 Like oil has zero value without the invention of engines (labor), water has no inherent value unless you drink it (which is a stretch but... labor)
3062 2018-09-24 17:42:23 Another #RocketManPresidential UN Speech and another .@VP Pence #BoosterJets moment. The @WhiteHouse message to Iran is: we'll go to WAR for your OIL like Bush did against Saddam Hussein for Iraq's oil. This administration is so PREDICTABLE.
3063 2018-09-24 17:42:21 Fair. Actually, I applied for a job today that is in my field and has nothing to do with Oil at Alberta Distillers. So getting that job would be awesome. Then while driving away I saw a sign for hiring labourers, once I get my fall protection, they'll take me. So $$$

Make them answer for Bears’s Ears given to oil co’s, Muslim ban, protecting fraudulent for profit colleges, ending civil rights. decreased # of refugees, hurricane Maria, deporting law-abiding spouses/ parents / neighbors and *BABIES IMPRISONED*
3069 2018-09-24 17:41:59 Now just imagine if we had this much oil money!
3070 2018-09-24 17:41:57 I’m gonna be broke before my financial aid ever credits. $120 for a routine oil change out here. This is ridiculous.

3072 2018-09-24 17:41:57 Well, that and unit trains carrying oil or ethanol, which I think everyone is trying to run a bit slower these days.
3073 2018-09-24 17:41:35 What Will Trigger The Next Oil Price Crash?
 
The supply-side story for oil prices is heavily skewed to the upside, with production losses from Iran and Venezuela causing a rapid tightening of the market. But the demand side of the equation is much more complex
3074 2018-09-24 17:41:32 Sana oil hahhahha
3075 2018-09-24 17:41:21 Sometimes I forget to turn the oil on so it just burns 
3076 2018-09-24 17:41:18 Oh, I can remember when the oil price was never coming back down and we were all meant to stockpile bullets...
3077 2018-09-24 17:41:14 Eso es lo de menos, cuando quedas campeón...! 
3078 2018-09-24 17:41:00 Sanctions on Iranian regime will not result in shortage in market oil supply. OPEC members and other producers can cover for any fall in production caused by sanctions.

3111 2018-09-24 17:37:26 To make your point , you have to give a reason.   Guy Verhavstadt has already said it will be no problem.  Spain has said it wouldn't veto.  Scotland, is the EU's largest oil producer with the largest fishing quota's. Also, I'm sure the EU would like to stick it to Wangland.
3112 2018-09-24 17:37:25 Never heard the term? I've changed a thermostat, replaced a coolant reservoir, replaced a bumper, cleaned a MAF sensor, replaced headlights, replaced fuses, installed an intake, done an oil change, etc. Not a mechanic but I do alright. If I can do it myself I will.
3113 2018-09-24 17:37:21 The ladder? Its part of an old set and works great to keep the power cable high up and out of the way for the forklift and unimogs going past. The tank itself is oil jacketed, with an insulation layer (so triple walled) and heated by a 9Kw element in the oil.

3122 2018-09-24 17:35:47 So you mean rally in crude oil today is because market did not get this correctly? Wow!

3139 2018-09-24 17:34:06 This is an old trick. Companies buy advertising in markets where they have no customers so that they can control the narrative. This happens with oil/fracked gas all the time - buy ads on MSNBC so that they won't talk about climate change out of fear of losing advertising $$.
3140 2018-09-24 17:33:57 Oil up as economy is taking off. Speculators now have reason to believe that trend will continue. The economy is more stable than Washington DC in general. The safer commodity bet. I'm more curious as to the other commodity prices today.

3145 2018-09-24 17:32:55 What is wrong? In the US, there is a lot of oil and gas too, but US oil companies are represented in many regions of the world. I understand correctly that you are denying this right to Russian oil producers only?

3155 2018-09-24 17:31:35 "Petrichor is the distinct scent of rain in the air. Or, to be more precise, it’s the name of an oil that’s released from the earth into the air before rain begins to fall."-Dictionary.com 
I love this smell!

3157 2018-09-24 17:31:25 For sure. I was one of the few who didn't feel much from edibles....and then I started using coconut oil instead of butter, and the lecithin as an emulsifier and I could not be more happy.
3158 2018-09-24 17:31:04 Because of a Labour political wheeze called the Climate Change Act to phase out coal fired stations and reward the dash for gas. Drax burning coal is cheaper to run than the older Gas plants. Yet its coal units have to convert to Gas by 2027. Gas is tied to the oil price.
3159 2018-09-24 17:31:00 The anti depressants they put me on put me in a state of what the dr called “Hyper Maina” i was at a bar and almost stabbed a guy for being a dick. When i talked to the Dr about it he said “Treating Bipolar disorder is like pouring oil on an engine hoping it gets in” thanks doc
3160 2018-09-24 17:31:00 Markets are down less than 0.68% and since they aren't closed until hours from now? Not sure that will hold. Oil prices are up about 3% today, which may have to do with a shift in buying. We'll see.
3161 2018-09-24 17:30:49 Very good insight.  It does always come back to oil followed by war.  I fear greatly for our country.  In many ways I feel we are no longer a country.  Certainly no justice.

3166 2018-09-24 17:30:10 Yes that's silly $ for an oil change but not unheard of for hypercars. It's beyond stupid to think the Roadster 2 would have any impact on that market for that reason (IF the car ever gets built). Supercars aren't an either/or, 0 sum game for the 1%; they buy whatever they want.
3167 2018-09-24 17:29:59 I have never heard of silicone degrading a late condom, but I absolutely have heard of oil/petroleum lubes eating latex
3168 2018-09-24 17:29:51 @johnmunyes63 kindly arrest the situation, there is brewing pent up discontent among the Kenyan Production Operators working in @TullowOilplc sites loading the crude oil.
3169 2018-09-24 17:29:33 Would that be the same Fraser Institute that receives huge funding from right wing American sources like the Koch brothers, along with the oil and pharmaceutical industries? No thanks. As part of a middle class family I'm not overly burdened by my tax bill.
3170 2018-09-24 17:29:31 R. Yehuda citing Rav: Remember Hanina b Hizkiya for good, were it not for him the entire book of Ezekiel would have been suppressed (lit. "hidden") because it contradicts the Torah. He brought 300 jugs of oil, sat in an attic, and expounded the contradictions #DafYomi 45a

3172 2018-09-24 17:29:23 We’ve been getting these little freezer/steamer bags of veggies. I do not steam them. They go in the pot with a little oil and seasoning, and get a chunk of salmon tossed on top. 

Anyway, I was curious about the calories and read the bag.

3184 2018-09-24 17:28:23 Si U.S solo estuviese preocupado por el precio del Crude oil para hacer las cosas que tiene que hacer....  Gadaffi todavia estaria bebiendo bourbon en las tetas de su harem .... Saddam estaria disparando al aire.... Y a los Iranies los dejarian lanzar misiles.
3185 2018-09-24 17:28:20 Why are we still using diesel?
No biodiesel, or recycled fryer oil? Especially on an island where everything has to be shipped! One would think it would be best 
 to save/recycle as many resources as possible.
Cool story about Dusten though..........

3201 2018-09-24 17:25:51 Anyone get CBD oil from Charlottes Web? We're now going down that path and I see there are 3 types:
Full Strength CBD Oil
Extra Strength CBD Oil
Original Formula CBD Oil

Definitely more hemp extract in the original formula and big price difference. Just curious what others use.

City used mainly money brought in by owner NOT money earned 

Huge difference

3229 2018-09-24 17:22:00 Or to put it another way: Much like the Millennium Bug, people will claim there was no problem because others beavered away diligently to solve it. And those who never knew there was a problem will be paying for the new machinery and its metaphorical oil, thankyouverymuch.

3234 2018-09-24 17:21:37 It is extra sticky! But it doesn't have to be painful when removing. Try using an oil on top of the tape (baby oil, coconut oil, olive oil, etc.). Massage it in and peel off...you won't be yelling Kelly Clarkson

3294 2018-09-24 17:14:55 @AmbJohnBolton's irresponsible remarks re: Iran have caused oil prices to surge. This will impact the middle class the most. But hey, it will increase profits for his buddies in the MIC.

3296 2018-09-24 17:14:35 Why are European companies abandoning Iran because of US pressure?
Don't they want to stand with their countries and weather these times together? China India Turkey will buy oil from Iran if price is right. India is getting free shipping I heard.

3357 2018-09-24 17:07:17 The price of gasoline and diesel does not reflect that data. The price of oil is $65.00 per barrel and diesel is $3.79 per gallon and gasoline at $3.39 per gallon. At the height of $5.29 gasoline, oil was $150.00. Consumers are getting gouged. Oil is our economy. Must Investigate

3399 2018-09-24 17:02:28 I don’t believe any of that.  It raises the cost of extraction and that’s it. Oil companies will drill if there is oil.  They will not walk away due to increased setbacks.   New setback rules are good for our communities.  We don’t want to look like Midland Texas

3422 2018-09-24 16:58:44 Are you willing to go to prison for life for Sedition when your last minute stunt proves to be as fake and frivolous as Stormy? Why don't you go back to chasing ambulances and selling snake oil.
3423 2018-09-24 16:58:36 I once had a problem with my 1/dogs joints. I left him to a place when we were going on holidays. When we returned the dog was bouncing. I said "wow" then he handed me back the medicine. He said "my advice to you is oil oil oil oil oil! get oil into your dog." 1/

3431 2018-09-24 16:57:54 @TheEllenShow My regular twitter acct (cannabisrising) got suspended for daring to share the ancient recipe for cannabis oil, which is a clear and present danger to big pharma profits because it's safe and effective medicine we can make at home in private. Thus the war.
3432 2018-09-24 16:57:38 They got battered by Lyon,
In an empty ground,
They couldn't sell it out,
Not even for a pound,
They got into the quarters,
Got beaten 5-1,
All that oil money,
Yet in Europe they won none

3444 2018-09-24 16:56:38 Have you tried eating it? Or making salves for pain relief? I make a salve with cannabis infused coconut oil, essential oils ( cypress,frankincense, Idaho balsam, chamomile) and beeswax. It feels great and helps with pain. Cbd also helps. Clean weed is important, no pesticides.
3445 2018-09-24 16:56:34 On the offshore oil rig
3446 2018-09-24 16:56:33 Jip! Flies, old oil, shit, crows, cockroaches, ants, old tyres. All black.
3447 2018-09-24 16:56:17 Yes but if they got an oil refinery  behind them 52,000 Moose they can become a big Club unlike Chelsea City West Ham Council House Renters

3449 2018-09-24 16:56:01 Back aboard! Yippee! But just fleeting visit to service the Beta43. Changed oil & filter, fuel filter & new air filter. Only issue, unable to drain gearbox oil since hybrid in way. Can only pump out oil but need to try to beg & borrow hand pump tomorrow. Now to pub @CliffordArms
3450 2018-09-24 16:55:59 when all the extensions go off, you should try using argan oil on your lashes. longer and thicker lashes as result (but i guess you know that, miss beauty guru nim uwu teach me your techniquezzz)

3455 2018-09-24 16:55:32 Ground bees meet filthy motor oil.
3456 2018-09-24 16:55:19 There is a similar reaction if you take the pan of burning oil to the sink and run water into it. 
Also: second degree burns hurt.

3460 2018-09-24 16:54:48 Come fix our transformer at JUji(Brochino) . We have been in darkness for over a month. This is not fair. We are not responsible for oil shortage. Come fix the transformer asap.

3464 2018-09-24 16:54:36 oh no not a RITUAL ! it's just a tiny little thingy 
just burn the wood and let it smoke and you're done
that's it
+ sandalwood oil does alot to skin actually it's the main thingy they use for lotions and skin cares and other beauty stuff

3468 2018-09-24 16:53:36 Honestly will change your whole thought process when it comes to smoking ahaha, that was the tail end of a medium strength oil but I’ll be getting myself some stronger stuff for when I’m out and about and can’t draw from it as often
3469 2018-09-24 16:53:14 Of course. But if you're next vehicle purchase is combustion engine you're costs are going to be higher period.  It isn't just fuel. It's the entire cost of operations (oil change, transmission, rear end maintenance, etc)

3472 2018-09-24 16:52:12 Mike and Julie, we loved your enthusiasm for extra virgin olive oil! Thanks so much for joining us on a #Rome #OliveTour. We are sure you will love the local Sabina #D.O.P. extra virgin #oliveoil you took home with you. We hope you had a safe return journey to California.
3473 2018-09-24 16:52:10 So I couldn’t work anymore. I barely left the house for 3 years. Nightmare. Hospitalized 3 times. I can’t even go there. Anyhow, I’ve heard that the oil works really well. Unfortunately I live in Virginia no med marijuana law. I hate it here
3474 2018-09-24 16:52:01 True. Also no revenue stream for trees to be planted actually opposite for timber and palm oil etc. The Axios piece actually says trees can’t do it fast enough which is why I refer to a tech leap
3475 2018-09-24 16:51:55 I think I bought the wrong stuff. Hemp oil... = CBD oil? 

Dangit.
3476 2018-09-24 16:51:52 It isn’t about a better or worse future. It is about technology not being suitable for all applications. NASA still uses whale oil, that application still applies today despite whale oil not being necessary for 99.9% of uses. The IC engine will still have use cases.
3477 2018-09-24 16:51:51 Oil changes be coming back around too fast

3493 2018-09-24 16:49:47 As Dr. Dettman states in our article: "The toxicity of oil changes as it biodegrades in the water... Diluted bitumen is most toxic when it initially enters the water and becomes less so as the lightest components of the oil either evaporate or are biodegraded."
3494 2018-09-24 16:49:27 Me. But then I forgot i cant train full time and i change oil for a living lol

3507 2018-09-24 16:48:44 Gotta admire @PChidambaram_IN's fiscal prudence: Reallocated defence money meant for MMRCA to pay for fuel subsidy and yet managed to leave a huge due in oil bonds... And this was presided over by none other than MMS, the Economist PM. Now where did this money go?

3519 2018-09-24 16:47:29 @Kadunaelectric I am talking about the transformer around Day Sabo Secondary School, JUji(Brochino).
This is wicked and cruel. I and other customers should not be punished for this nonsense. We are not responsible for the oil shortage. The transformer was not vandalized.
3520 2018-09-24 16:47:23 lol all i see here is hate man . how does what you are saying even make sense. i guess maybe you know nothing about him that,s is why you can say all this nonsense , pff dated a girl, changed oil i bet u are probably the same without the money
3521 2018-09-24 16:47:21 It's time for your friendly reminder to get your oil changed, folks! Maintenance is cheaper than repair! Also don't neglect your tires and tire pressure!

3527 2018-09-24 16:47:01 There’s a whole industry in large parts of Texas, North Dakota and Alaska (hint: all red states) that LOVE higher oil prices, because it helps pay for silly little things like rigs, steel, and salaries.

It’s called (wait for it)..... the oil and gas industry.
3528 2018-09-24 16:46:55 Freddy starts in the oil field Wednesday. I’m excited but sad because I’m so use to being around him now. :(

3534 2018-09-24 16:45:59 I'm starting to have a change of heart about everybody's obsession with non-oil growth. 
They say when we didn't have oil is when we truly developed.

2. Swill charcoal-infused coconut oil around your mouth

Simple!

 اهم شي مكتوب extra virgin
3543 2018-09-24 16:44:46 yes but unfortunately many oil stocks havn't increased in value.
3544 2018-09-24 16:44:41 oh and make sure you're still using a moisturizer after cleansing, even though you're oily. cleansing without putting that moisture back in can cause your skin to over produce sebum. try to find a moisturizer that says oil free
3545 2018-09-24 16:44:41 Good point, yes, that would have been a good idea but this was a really quick, off the cuff piece. We should maybe do a more clearly defined agri-business-oil-business comparison episode, but this one has already upset many.

3549 2018-09-24 16:44:18 What’s one of the most annoying parts of being a girl??? Going in for a simple oil change and being told 26352 things that are all of a sudden wrong with your car and need immediate attention
3550 2018-09-24 16:44:11 @Kadunaelectric The annoying part was that, we had to pay for the transformer to get taken to your office. Now, the transformer is back and I was told your staff said the oil is short. Since when has it been my responsibility to top transformer oil for Nepa?

3554 2018-09-24 16:43:29 As all analysis are predicting oil at $90, it's safe to assume oil rally is in its last stage. Buy OMC
3555 2018-09-24 16:43:26 Look at canola oil doin something for herself @ideereed @ToriLeePlunkett
3556 2018-09-24 16:43:25 Ruto is wrong.
For a matatu owner,other than the increase in fuel prices,he is also paying more for spare parts,service inputs such as engine oil n tyres because those who deal with these items are citing higher transportation cost.
Even a butcher is paying more to transport meat
3557 2018-09-24 16:43:20 And these same snake oil salesmen main argument is that we saved Europe from Fascists so we don’t need them, at the same time a voting with fascists! The world have gone mad!!!!
3558 2018-09-24 16:43:15 I lost $50 , my car note is due , & i need an oil change  Happy Monday
3559 2018-09-24 16:43:15 They did not get any motor oil, or much of anything. My hood and gas tank cover were open though and there was paper towel under the car, near where one might try to drain oil from.

Last #SST call was posted at 6:51 am when #USOil was traded around 71.95. Waiting for the entry was a condition but even if the entry was 71.95, a 60 pt profit was still possible. Did you make it or miss the boat again?

3610 2018-09-24 16:37:35 Yeah $100 per barrel is next there’s nothing Trump can do to lower this price anymore
3611 2018-09-24 16:37:34 the analysts are so behind the curve on this (no pun intended), that they dont realize that the drillers and misc oil service providers are where the real value is now. JPM still rates underperform on most oil services equities, including $RIG , bonkers
3612 2018-09-24 16:37:25 That's gonna hurt their GDP
3613 2018-09-24 16:37:19 so the momentum group du jour is reverse split/lowfloat oil/gas names. e.g. $SAEX $JONE $GBR $MXC. one that isn't mentioned very often, but had a 1/15 r/s at the end of july, is $PKD. down about 40% from there too. worth a radar
3614 2018-09-24 16:37:01 Will greed of @OPECSecretariat cause the global growth to take a shave and eventually the oil price swoon?

3628 2018-09-24 16:35:14 Every time the $100 oil forecasts come out, that's when the market usually goes the other way. Speculators driving this market and nothing else. Could be looking for the double top and previous high,  but not about to bet against shale yet. They will continue to flood at +70.
3629 2018-09-24 16:35:09 Michael Avenonuts, As soon as they hooked up with you, the snake oil salesman, they became a standing joke. This is really fun watching the crap shows you bring to the table. Delicious!

3632 2018-09-24 16:34:50 So now the oil price tops $80 a barrel and is expected to hit $100. That is an absolute disaster for SA because every consumer cmofity is 100% reliant on road transport. The fuel price will top R20 a litre before the end of this year, sending CPI & inflation stratospheric.

3670 2018-09-24 16:29:57 @realDonaldTrump it will be so severe that it will have a terrible effect in the November election, the exemption for our oil embargo on our red flag.
3671 2018-09-24 16:29:51 2/2 I don't really care if you believe one thing or another, & I agree renewables are a tech of the future, but to claim there is no market for oil bc you don't like fossil fuels is not reasonable. And I don't really feel like continuing to argue about this, honestly

3674 2018-09-24 16:29:35 @realDonaldTrump I will never compromise on one thing, and I'm not joking about it with anyone, it's a full boycott of oil. If even a refinery is exempted from sanctions by November, our reaction will be very severe,

3687 2018-09-24 16:28:17 The economy is booming increasing the demand for oil, this is not a bad thing. The refinery process/regulations and state regulations is what drives up gas prices the most.
3688 2018-09-24 16:28:15 Someone who acts in defense of a position/party/ideology, often without regard to evidence or reason. ie. comparing oil to agent orange, when pointed to increase oil consumption worldwide, as a response to claim oil is a dying industry. 1/2
3689 2018-09-24 16:28:13 I bought this lip oil only because of how cute the bottle is. Branding and marketing is super important when owning a business. There are ppl (like me, lol) who would literally buy a product just because the packaging/container is appealing.

3691 2018-09-24 16:27:49 I would've put Tiger higher if he would've had some competition! Nobody was ever challenging him down the stretch, so he really wasn't pressured too hard. He was leaking oil on the back 9, wished somebody would've stepped up to the challenge.

3701 2018-09-24 16:26:06 "Lofty goals" is just a buzzword that sounds nice. But as of now it's just idealist fantasy. In order to take it seriously, I'd like to see the math.

3816 2018-09-24 16:15:33 wheat in Ruble-terms is up @ 80% in 10 years and wheat acreage up 7% over the same period. for comparison, Russia's main export earner, Oil in Ruble-terms up 65% , production up 22%. I'd say some correlation to Ruble-weakness but stronger for Oil than wheat.

3823 2018-09-24 16:15:02 They have pretty much cut all ties to Canada except oil because we called them out on detaining Samar Badawi and the potential death sentence of Israa al-Ghomgham, plus enacted smear campaigns against Canada.
3824 2018-09-24 16:14:42 Good step in right direction but I hope they watch added fats and the vegan foods are not swimming in oil.  Just being vegan does not automatically translate to healthy but it's a start.
3825 2018-09-24 16:14:37 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @AmbJohnBolton @SecPompeo  Trump,the dumb Iranian Mullah doesn’t understand the power of Trump for shutting their oil down. UK deceived&fooled inexperienced Muslim Obama to let Mullahs to humiliated our troops in Persian Gulf.
3826 2018-09-24 16:14:33 This has helped but it's 4 x a day. I am on 3 other BP meds already, have a stent in the back heart artery. It's from chemo 17 y ago. Anyway. YOU might not, cut back on salt and bad fat, use good olive oil instead.

3828 2018-09-24 16:14:04 It could have been a far better outcome  had ONGC bought an overseas oil field for USD6bh instead of HPCL??? Did Modi government miss a golden opportunity to buy strategic oil reserves while they were sold for throwaway prices instead of building oil reservoirs....

3831 2018-09-24 16:13:45 What say you about Saudi Arabia? Should we keep deluding ourselves that oil is “cheap” while we buy monster SUV’s and oppose new public transportation projects? While helping Saudi’s massacre innocent people in proxy wars against Iran? Tax the  out of oil.

3847 2018-09-24 16:12:17 Hand trimmed vs machine trimmed. A machine trim does what you described. As for oil - a solid extraction process easily allows for this. No conspiracy here. :)

3907 2018-09-24 16:05:47 Big green has easier money than big oil. Big green only needs to sit in front computer and keys in emission or whatever numbers, and skims the top of them. Big oil at least needs to dig holes, transport, extract, sell.

3920 2018-09-24 16:04:28 Really ? That's weird ! Yet all those countries have tremendous oil to exploit. If arming rebels for fighting against Assad regime might give them opportunities to exploit that oil, they've failed. Russia & Iran which are the Allies of Syria won't give up.

3932 2018-09-24 16:02:43 Mmmm-hmmmm .... there's a reason for this.

I mean, didn't someone just come out selling it?  Also, how do they get 30% THC oil when they don't sell 30% THC bud?

 - ephemeral *and* enduring

3989 2018-09-24 15:56:49 I agree with getting the oil going, but we have to opt out of the global warming/carbon tax hoax
3990 2018-09-24 15:56:37 Meanwhile Florida is one of the few states that doesn’t even require emissions testing on it’s automobiles.  But Rick Scott wouldn’t want to do anything to upset big oil.

4006 2018-09-24 15:55:15 I love fruity olive oil. Fruity in that sense isn’t, for instance, apple-like. It just means some combination of light, refreshing, and sweet.
4007 2018-09-24 15:55:07 Damn I kind of miss working at a dealership only bc I really need an oil change and they would do it while I was clocked in and for free 
4008 2018-09-24 15:55:02 I always get those reminders to change the oil in my car but I never do it
4009 2018-09-24 15:54:59 Burn the midnight oil and VOTE!!!

4033 2018-09-24 15:52:35 If Talbot can be a top-15 starter this season, the Oilers are a playoff team IMO. If he's 15-20, which is where I have him pegged based on skill/talent, then they need a backup to also win more than he loses in order to get into the playoffs. Koskinen was signed to be that guy.
4034 2018-09-24 15:52:34 Acá en la corporación de PDVSA, con familia y en lo personal se observa su anterior pedestal como una de las 10 empresas mas poderosas siguiendo un perfil similar a Standar Oil, aun se mueven cifras en proyectos, superiores al valor neto empresarial de @elonmusk, Aqua Infernalis

4037 2018-09-24 15:52:13 Hmmm. When I was kid we occasionally did fondues (proper hot oil ones for meat not yer cheese stuff) and one of the dipping sauces mum would make for it would be ketchup mixed with mayo
4038 2018-09-24 15:52:10 Yeah but he’s taking all that money and trying to move industry to other planets, so earth will be pollution free. xD

4057 2018-09-24 15:50:49 Norway also has a huge oil fund they can use to balance any distortion. 

In my experience, having lived 28 years under socialism is that socialism borrows from capitalism to settle debts. Go full socialist and there'll be no capitalism to borrow from (USSR, Venezuela, etc )

1. Unemployment ( reachout to those oil companies to come back to warri, loans to artisans and market women)
2..Massive road construction ( construction of all intra city roads
3. Create mediums for exportation of our farm produce
4. Prompt payment of salaries
4063 2018-09-24 15:50:33 That said, you still disarm the perception of lefties/SJW's being some sort of humourless rigid monoliths and you may indeed change some of the people in the audience, which should be ultimate goal. Audiences can be swayed, snake oil salespeople not so much.
4064 2018-09-24 15:50:32 I do have a well developed pallet, and can definitely apply those kinds of terms to, say, olive oil. In that instance, they seem less nonsense than one might expect.

4069 2018-09-24 15:50:18 If that was truly their concern— the trial would have been modified 5 years ago (when they rejected $AMRN approval for wider indication)— mineral oil not an issue anymore.
4070 2018-09-24 15:50:08 Fair enough, evidence to date doesn't inspire confidence, but I'm also not at practice every day watching Koskinen and he admittedly didn't have a chance on most goals last night. His next start, assuming he gets a third chance, is huge for his hope of starting the season in NHL.

4086 2018-09-24 15:49:04 With that said, if the D isn't much better, Talbot becomes a secondary issue. He's not an elite goalie but imo, there are only a few of those guys.

4103 2018-09-24 15:47:40 To date, this year we've seen a 4.2% growth rate, and it's on track to finish even higher. It's not Obama policies that did this, we jumped to the worlds #1 oil producer when trump authorized keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Nothing to do with Obama.

4114 2018-09-24 15:47:02 Is it ok to cry to Landslide in public? 

A. No I’m so macho and manly that the only emotions I show are pride and anger and I drink motor oil instead of coffee.

B. Yes, I’m actually doing it currently and plan on crying to a bunch of other songs throughout the day.

4116 2018-09-24 15:46:51 Walking home without contacts is the equivalent of walking through one of those really blurry oil paintings.
4117 2018-09-24 15:46:47 So what happened to all those "we will never see oil at $100 again".

Rhetorical question, really

4121 2018-09-24 15:46:31 Sir: combination of many factors as  trading is due to macro and technical factors. Global factors combined with domestic slowdown have impacted us. Oil has not helped us either. We need to control our fiscal deficit and CAD.

Look up "inalienable". These freedoms and rights belong to everyone and aren't "earned". 

You're not protecting freedom, you're violently destroying it in poor nations all over the world at the behest of oil companies & the military industrial complex.

4174 2018-09-24 15:42:06 @James_Crabtree Actually, Chevrolet are making a huge commitment to both oil and electric: they have diesel motors in the Cruze, Equinox, and Colorado, plus two oil-burners in the Silverado. Volt and BoltEv round-out their electrics with more in the pipeline.

4255 2018-09-24 15:35:59 Yes they have and America have sanctioned them. They banned people from buying any Venezuelan debt, or investing in Venezuela.
Now they are cutting the barrel-age of Venezuelan oil to OPEC.

4265 2018-09-24 15:34:46 @Varneyco so why are our prices for gas and heating oil so high here in the USA. Give us a break!!!
4266 2018-09-24 15:34:43 Someone crunched the numbers & found that if the #USA successfully adopted #EU vehicle fuel consumption standards then y'all could drive as much as you do now & not have to import any oil. Not sure of the year - might not be true any more. But heck.

4276 2018-09-24 15:34:02 The price of Brent oil briefly climbed past $80 a barrel as OPEC and its allies decided to keep their production in check. Brent’s move comes as some analysts believe OPEC and its allies will struggle to make up for the lost production from Iran and Venezuela.

4296 2018-09-24 15:31:58 You forgot to tweet that Saudi Arabia did not follow you and the oil prices are still increasing or did they just tell you to not get involved., as it might put you into another problem 
4297 2018-09-24 15:31:56 what's happen now is big. SArabia pushes high to make pressure on Trump to sanctions Iran then it pump the Oil to 40$, Russia also wants The US sanctions on Iran to get Iran away from Europe and dominate them. China is happy for [20-25]$ the cursed Iranian oil to set the CN/Oil
4298 2018-09-24 15:31:50 Iran can also firmly plug the Straits of Hormuz and cut the West off from Persian Gulf oil. By the time the US can even react, gas prices in US will have already soared to $9.00 a gallon, plunging US into economic disaster. Because prices will go up 5 min. after straits plugged.

4309 2018-09-24 15:30:57 So if China were to go on an oil buyers strike & collapse the oil price then what control has the US over that? Fed can't print oil & it can't cancel oil either & whether US has zero or infinite gold is irrelevant #OOTT

4351 2018-09-24 15:28:26 You probably think that stupid pipeline is good for the US. Trump made millions signing that order his first day in office and the US doesn’t see shit from it. Canada running oil straight to a duty-free port in Texas to sell it overseas. US doesn’t get a dime from it.
4352 2018-09-24 15:28:16 Fudging facts is a lot of work - saying GDP is growing at 8.2% when your RBI monetary policy committee is questioning it. Almost ruining SME's through DeMo is a lot of work.

4397 2018-09-24 15:23:27 that’s really weird. if it were me, I would suspect a personal grudge. The fastest, most reliable way to destroy an engine is to run it without oil. I mean… nobody steals motor oil from a car to actually use it.

4403 2018-09-24 15:22:46 This is so shameful behaviour of the govt,asking for interest for full month but not giving time till 31st. So much pressure on practising cas,who will have to burn midnight oil to meet the deadline.
4404 2018-09-24 15:22:38 This is exactly what govt spokespersons say when confronted with hard facts about economy, oil, rupee, defence preparedness etc. TT was already declared null and void by SC, so it was just a political brownie point. PMJAY is too early to comment on, so I will reserve judgment.

The tree leaves I just used a oil paint brush and went crazy putting small strokes everywhere, then adding highlights from the sun. The grass I used a pen brush with pressure sensitivity and stroked up.

4430 2018-09-24 15:18:59 @POTUS it’s time to dump OPEC and keep American oil home. OPEC has been the biggest thorn in America’s ass since joining. It’s time to step up oil production here in the states and keep the oil here. The lower the gasoline prices at the pump will grow our economy.
4431 2018-09-24 15:18:52 I wish I stayed in bed! New Secretary of State Rudy has recommended regime change in Iran."I don't know when but its going to happen" sanctions have created economic chaos ready for revolution!

4441 2018-09-24 15:18:12 Yes, they do get around piles of rubbish. Too many have been well and truly mugged by this share. I predict any RNS and the price will continue to spiral down. Too many have been taken in by hype and will never return. I bet you are laughing all day.

4444 2018-09-24 15:17:43 But that leaves 22 games with an issue? That's more than 1/4 of the season and you can't afford to piss away 30-44 points in the standings because of bad goaltending and expect to make the playoffs. I worry a bit about Talbot with the pressure of a contract year hanging over him.
4445 2018-09-24 15:17:37 When they have "healed" skin then try coconut oil massaged in really helps the hair grow.  We used it on our Frenchie and it was amazing
4446 2018-09-24 15:17:35 But my point were less about sanctions and more about your incomprehensible omission of Venezuela sovereign default in a piece that is supposed to be discussing the role of financial duress in the collapse of VZ oil sector. The word default is not mentioned once in your piece.

4476 2018-09-24 15:14:55 He is doing everything he can. What are the problems India is facing currently? Maybe the rising price of oil, but that is not his fault, the US sanctions on Iran from where we import oil is influeing oil cost, not the Prime Minster.

4581 2018-09-24 15:05:47 Well you have a problem it's called opec.
Designs to stop oil prices escalating and monopolies on oil.
It's actually used to sustain oil prices higher than they should be.
Ordering less available barrels. Maintaining one oil fields production when others drop to protect profits

4597 2018-09-24 15:04:41 Actually Venezuela’s economy is 70% private enterprise, so not neither Communist nor very Socialist.

Venezuela is a developing country with large oil resources, in an ideological war to provide more for their people, in an economic war with the worlds only remaining Super Power.

Indian Govt imposes Excise Duty on the crude oil prices.
When crude oil prices went excessively low, Govt didn't let petrol prices go down 4 public but raised Duty 12 times & looted us.
Now, when crude oil prices r high, why shouldn't that duty be decreased?

4678 2018-09-24 14:56:51 The only notable Yoruba entrepreneur now is Michael Adenuga. I say this quite consciously because most other names are oil & gas barons. Most of what stood as testaments of industry in Oyo State are gone- Exide Batteries, Leyland Autos & many others.

4738 2018-09-24 14:50:29 In short, the argument was based on a supply-driven analysis that weighed the sources of future oil supply against the prices that would be needed to make the extraction and processing of that oil economically viable.
4739 2018-09-24 14:50:23 years ago, when I (Jeff Rubin) was still chief economist at CIBC World Markets, I forecast that global economic growth was on pace to send oil prices to $200 (U.S.) a barrel by 2012.
4740 2018-09-24 14:50:21 Once again my position didn't change. See my explanatn earlier. Bcos Nig is a mono economy, changes in oil prices of course affect d economy, BUT IT DOESN'T CRASH IT. U simply employ micro and macro fiscal discipline to manage ur economy until you're out, which was wht Iweala did

4808 2018-09-24 14:44:08 Yeah, it's an interesting issue. Typically if they have time, they'll wash your windows and even ask if you want the oil checked.  So I could see that it could involve extra service even though it's a job and they have to it, cuz we aren't allowed to.  But it is a hard job!!

4816 2018-09-24 14:43:47 Would regular fish oil do the same to lower trigs?
4817 2018-09-24 14:43:47 よし！いこう！！！！
4818 2018-09-24 14:43:44 Yes it shall. Remember If you have an NIV bible, you can see in 1 Samuel 16 the top of the page says “Samuel Anoints David”, IMMEDIATELY the next chapter, 1 Samuel 17, says “David and Goliath”....

4822 2018-09-24 14:43:23 I do understand the sense of the tweet. Please note 'similar' in my tweet. I agree with you that countries should not only count on extractive industries e.g. oil, and that creative industries also need some attention. I simply didn't understand how #Rwanda came in as an example.

4825 2018-09-24 14:43:09 Looking at arrogance of @arunjaitley @narendramodi @IncomeTaxIndia in extending tax due date by 15 days with clauses, see businessmen will bring all arrogance to ground. In few weeks #Sensex will correct by 10%, oil will go to US$90, ₹ will fall to 74.50 all time low.

4847 2018-09-24 14:40:22 Why was Bretton Woods ditched in favour of neoliberalism? From what I gather, it was greed, using the oil crises etc as an excuse to dupe people into accepting trickle down and aspiration (credit/debt) disguising poverty/inequality.
Or am I v cynical?  Was there another reason?

They all have a certain scent. That picture is enough to evoke it for me. Kind of sharp, a little dusty, with just a hint of oil. A smell that promises something interesting is nearby.
4868 2018-09-24 14:38:09 All the UMNO agenda to collide Tun Mahathir with Anwar. Media on board to put oil and that pathetic fire by UMNO.

4888 2018-09-24 14:35:46 We need to see how the data looks ultimately.  But this mineral oil story reminds me of the $GWPH, it's all because of drug interaction with clobazam, story.  Missing the forest for the trees.

4892 2018-09-24 14:35:30 Try some 4-7-8 breaths, in for 4, hold for 7, out for 8, and repeat until you've calmed down. I also suggest using lavender (unless you're allergic) oil. I know it doesn't work for everyone but it works for me so hopefully it'll work for you. Best wishes to you!

Same silence there - how do they do that? /x
4904 2018-09-24 14:33:48 Seems like. And you're talking to someone who makes his own beard oil (argan/jojoba/bergamot/cedarwood FTW). If men buy this, I guess that 'Man Cave' is there as reassurance that we're not being made to do this by women. Because that would be unmanly.

4941 2018-09-24 14:30:17 Think of a scale:

One side, A: anarcho-capitalism.
The other, B: whatever is the opposite, high regulation, etc.

Hong Kong produced fantastic results and is loser to A.

Venezuela produced horrible results (despite oil reserves), and it's closer to B.

How is closer to A worse?

4962 2018-09-24 14:29:06 Impossible.. every Muslim knows that saudi are wahabi kings and not islamic.. during 1970 all islamic countries banned selling oil to US .. all those 17 rulers were finished slowly..only Saudi remains though it was part of the ban ..
4963 2018-09-24 14:28:51 With $50 bil in #Hurricane losses and coal ash destroying the environment in the Carolinas. #climatechange costs continue to soar. With high oil prices. Reaffirms we NEED Tesla to be successful. It’s a national security issue. $tsla

4966 2018-09-24 14:28:47 Not all people believe it's a "fossil fuel" I think around 80% of the world's energy  still comes from "fossil fuels" and I also believe natural gas to be the least polluting of aspect of the oil and gas industry? Then you need to think about fertilizers, plastics etc...

4974 2018-09-24 14:27:54 I used to think nationalism is inherently bad, until I read about Mossadegh and his wave of Iranian nationalism which sought independence from Britain and nationalization of the oil company.
4975 2018-09-24 14:27:47 Cool! I've tried acrylic and oil as hobby, certainly not very good with them though, although I guess I could if I practiced more.

Can I ask how long have you been working with acrylic? Is it something you started with in art, or have you first been drawing or something?
4976 2018-09-24 14:27:39 It couldn't be because the stock market went up, large cap went up, consumer discretionary held firm? I mean, the price of Himalayan yak hair has a .90 correlation to crude oil.
4977 2018-09-24 14:27:28 Agree... doubt any real effect of mineral oil here
4978 2018-09-24 14:27:27 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
4979 2018-09-24 14:27:27 As far as infusion I do coconut oil and sunflower lecithin (emulsifier). I decarb for 30 at 240 then into the crockpot for 6ish hours on low stirring every 30 mins. The oil is great, I just have to get them more firm next go round. They for SURE get you high as fuck.
4980 2018-09-24 14:27:22 .@fscutz says a potential US solution for #Venezuela is an oil embargo, but that would severely damage the country, a problem the US would later have to fix. Rather, the Venezuelan oil business is imploding on its own, he argues.
4981 2018-09-24 14:27:20 fish oil? 
4982 2018-09-24 14:27:17 Friend of mine ordered some new parts. Possible bad armature. Was able to drain the oil out alright with a very well hidden drain plug.

4990 2018-09-24 14:26:34 via GerberKawasaki: Oil prices soaring as OPEC continues to push prices up. Iran production offline. Great news for Tesla as the value of owning an #EV increases every dollar oil prices go up. $tsla $tsla

4997 2018-09-24 14:25:46 Exactly why I feel markets may not be there for the buying just yet, and that some more selling may be left. Especially with September expiry this week, credit policy announcement next week (rate hike almost a given), boiling oil prices, US trade tensions and elections next year.
4998 2018-09-24 14:25:45 Goodwill. I picked one up for an oil rag.
4999 2018-09-24 14:25:33 Oil prices soaring as OPEC continues to push prices up. Iran production offline. Great news for Tesla as the value of owning an #EV increases every dollar oil prices go up. $tsla
5000 2018-09-24 14:25:31 OPEC doesn't set the price of oil. Oil traders do. Speculation is what is driving oil prices up.
5001 2018-09-24 14:25:17 Art my guy. Saw some oil painting earlier that looks like this & its expensive as fuck. Makes you wonder Who/what determines the value of an art piece
5002 2018-09-24 14:25:13 I’ve been mixing bio oil and tea tree oil and using it before bed this week. So far my acne is dried up and my skin is soft. Will update.
5003 2018-09-24 14:25:11 do people really think peak oil is about running out???
5004 2018-09-24 14:25:03 And the Govt will pay that amount for oil bonds?

5009 2018-09-24 14:24:06 peak oil is  not about running out of oil its the peak of production
5010 2018-09-24 14:24:05 Mix in six pounds of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
5011 2018-09-24 14:24:04 I agree. They have been bought out completely by the oil industry.  Biggest disappointment in Canadian politics @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @RachelNotley

5029 2018-09-24 14:22:26 From an Oiler fan, and former Reinhart fan, he simply doesn't have the footspeed, or aggression level to be effective. I was excited to get in in Edm, loved him on the Oil Kings, but his game simply doesn't translate to an NHL calibre.

5032 2018-09-24 14:22:19 When will the BJP govt come out of its campaigning/election mode to assume governance responsibilities? Bangladeshis are termites, RaGa is conspiring with Hollande, still blaming MMS for oil price and rupee collapse, while the PM is on another tangent of Swachh Bharat altogether
5033 2018-09-24 14:22:19 ｽﾐﾏｾﾝ..
5034 2018-09-24 14:22:18 Use of mineral oil as placebo would have been a valid debate if CVOT close to 10% and borderline stat sig. Slight increase in LDL-C and maybe then in events, might have pushed effect size over the line. But effect size here is so large it defies any attempt to undermine validity
5035 2018-09-24 14:22:07 remember when people thought it was about running out of oil ? when its not
5036 2018-09-24 14:22:03 I find that a bit unrealistic. If Alaska charged more, either oil prices would go up or profits would go down. Also Alaska puts 25% of its oil revenue into the fund, so it could technically quadruple the dividend without impacting oil drilling incentives at all.

5041 2018-09-24 14:21:49 But therein lies the problem. You’ve already labeled your beliefs as being the right. Absolute. A progressive doesn’t question everything just to be a punk, we question things to make sure they are the right way. Sure, we question whether oil dependence is viable...
5042 2018-09-24 14:21:45 Getting oil changes first thing is the move. No lines, best coffee available. Life is good

5047 2018-09-24 14:21:26 #fscutz misrepresents #Venezuela debt to China when he states that "debt stands at $50 billion" (it is estimated nearer 20) or that "oil sent to China is a free gift" (it is repayment for loans). Not helpful turns of speech.
5048 2018-09-24 14:21:25 We will be better off when Democrats get behind the people instead of the corporations. We want the endless wars to stop. These “regime changes are important to no one but big oil.” Stop shoving war down our throats!

5050 2018-09-24 14:21:20 peak oil is about the cost of produce not running out

5108 2018-09-24 14:15:42 Despite trade wars, no real demand pick-up globally oil has gone up in a steady manner and sheiks are now targeting 90-100 dollars. Who's the target ? Sad that Govt did nothing for local oil exploration. Now suffer

5114 2018-09-24 14:14:46 .@tom_peters RE today’s experience quote. When referring to oil burner service techs one would say “he has 10-yrs experience” Dad would ask “is it truly 10-yrs experience or 1-year’s experience 10-times?” Big difference.

5117 2018-09-24 14:14:24 Shouldn't this be having more of a downward effect on oil? I see that oil has been in a range lately but it sure seems pretty comfortable at the top of that range.
5118 2018-09-24 14:14:18 This man said “ You smell like coconut oil and heaven , let me go “ 
5119 2018-09-24 14:14:17 Mine took 6 month lol. Patience and castor oil helped
5120 2018-09-24 14:14:11 Almost laughable, given size of effect here, that anyone could seriously worry about that now.  If that amount of mineral all causes even 5% increase in CVOT we have a bigger breaking news story than fish oil

5139 2018-09-24 14:12:35 I understand why you cannot impose GST on oil but atleast do something to control fuel prices as rupee has also faced a lot of set back due to this. If we aim to strengthen our economy, we have to strengthen rupee.

5162 2018-09-24 14:10:41 This might imply the best good news for the US economy. The dollar could lose more ground while at the same time its BoP stays healthy enough thx to non conventional oil production gathering more steam.
5163 2018-09-24 14:10:39 Acknowledged. But there would have been no oil & gas trade w/o the agreement to halt nuclear weapons development.

The relaxation of sanctions, financial support & renewed trade are inextricably linked with the agreement regarding nuclear weapons development.
5164 2018-09-24 14:10:33 Are you getting any share of that oil? Or the immense profit from selling it? Why accept that bargain — I’d say it’s *only* because you accept it as normal. The corporations get these sweet deals because they pay off politicians — whether it’s Hillary or the republicans.

5184 2018-09-24 14:07:55 Now that there are indications that oil prices might hit 100dollars in the fourth quarter,  do we have a plan to start reducing our debts through robust financial management starting from next year. We need peg our 2019 budget estimates to less than 60 dollars to save enough.
5185 2018-09-24 14:07:55 We are still extracting oil from the earth and simultaneously destroying our health whereas the sun has enough energy to power the whole world, and we have not yet managed to go 100% green.....and you are talking about mining asteroids?

5209 2018-09-24 14:06:02 The United States have done more regime changes around the World than Russia or any of our allies combined. When is about oil, territories, military bases, they will change foreign regimes when is convenient.
5210 2018-09-24 14:06:02 Yes, this is really interesting. One thing is that fish oil pills aren’t cheap and swallowing dozens of those monster capsules a day may cost more than a vascepa co-pay.

5221 2018-09-24 14:05:10 Increase in oil revenues shouldn't lead to free spending. The country is in debt due to excess borrowing done to curtail the recession we just had. Now I see the time to save up to boost liquidity and stimulate economic growth.

5230 2018-09-24 14:03:43 Goodness me, I thought with oil prices moving up so strongly to continued multi-year highs, that was bullish for equities and demand.
5231 2018-09-24 14:03:20 You've never changed oil in my car. The colorful language used trying to get my oil filter off will get the CRTC involved pretty quick.

5234 2018-09-24 14:02:55 The rise in the price of oil is a welcome development. Government must save most of its earnings for the rainy day. This is the time to boost the excess crude oil account and the sovereign wealth fund.
5235 2018-09-24 14:02:44 They could - a physical inspection would be best. However, I have since learned that point-deduction violations such as oil, cleanup, wall hitting or even block doinking are suspended for the countdown.

5250 2018-09-24 14:01:09 Tiger’s rabid fan base is hilarious. Chirp when he wins one, not before. It’s been 10 years. This is like an Oilers fan after the 2017 playoffs, 1 goal away from West Conf finals, saying “Anyone think the Oil won’t win a cup soon?!” You ain’t Nostradamus, wait for it...
5251 2018-09-24 14:00:41 If you don't like the Oil in the water, then don't drink it!

5254 2018-09-24 14:00:32 I got distracted and baked tomatoes, chilies and peppers with onions, garlic, carrot and a potato. Carrot and potato were put in a wee bowl to suggest I knew what I was doing and everything else got dumped on a bit of garlicy toast with olive oil thrown over it. Bruschetta win!
5255 2018-09-24 14:00:31 Could be American sanctions that is starving their people because special interests want the oil they have? Bought of politicians that work on the behalf of people that line their pockets.. claiming it is ripe for regime change. I’m not sure but that’s just a random guess.

5257 2018-09-24 14:00:20 Interesting, thank you. Value your thoughts on it. 

It’s a gas play rather than oil however, although UK nat gas prices are also going great guns atm 
5258 2018-09-24 14:00:15 Bless you thank you.
I use a natural conditioner with no harsh chemicals or sulphates, the brand is Sukin... however I think the shine might come from the Argan oil I put in my hair 
5259 2018-09-24 14:00:15 Nah it's calm. U gota put the oil in first. Cos that was my worry. But its cool. Plus i only do it once every 2 weeks. When i get my trim
5260 2018-09-24 14:00:07 I followed the directions on the container - 1 cup of water + half smashed plantain + a tablespoon of Veggie beans  + half tablespoon of the fish powder +butter (I substituted coconut oil with butter)
5261 2018-09-24 13:59:49 Please expedite utilization of natural resources i.e. minerals and Oil & Gas. More projects on renewable energy. More institutes for Technical Education. All these would increase job opportunities and create wealth in #Pakistan

5264 2018-09-24 13:59:36 I don't know; but you use the deaths of 39 people to express it. And call us rich despite those trophies being but by blood, sorry, oil money.
5265 2018-09-24 13:59:18 It's a must Do. Go for it @kodedgh233. #Hosanna is got the #OIL overflow. Always on Playing  @myfaithchannel #WFBS
5266 2018-09-24 13:59:10 Where do you see "very scary [oil] demand growth" for next year? I see continued strong YoY demand growth until at least $120 Brent by end-2018. If price surges above that level, then yes, oil demand growth would suffer, but that scenario *assumes* a price surge first.
5267 2018-09-24 13:58:38 .@taranfn at #ffcc18: do supply side limits on oil production make sense for Norway even in post-Paris world? YES: signal reinforces Paris commitment + insurance if Paris fails. And if Paris succeeds, minimal cost bc foregone production wold have been uneconomic anyway. Win-win.

5276 2018-09-24 13:57:41 Who cares. Without the tanker of oil you won't be able to make such subjective measurements

5278 2018-09-24 13:57:09 Can you elaborate on the "only a small percentage will make it to the functional long chain: statement?  I'm always vexed by the purported n3:n6 balance in canola oil, it just doesn't seem like it should be possible in a plant-derived oil.
5279 2018-09-24 13:57:09 We will see how his chatter works on oil Saudi Oil Min said they are complying and no issues - Iran and the same traders talking the price up
5280 2018-09-24 13:56:50 I just hope the government of the day won't make the mistake of the Jonathan government when money made from high oil prices were frittered away on jamborees without saving for the rainy day. This is an opportunity to save up and repay some of our debts.

5294 2018-09-24 13:55:45 I am skeptical of the claims that cannabinoid oil cures everything thanks in part to advice my dad gave me once: "If a dealer says he has *everything*, he's got nothing. He's just going to mug you."

5318 2018-09-24 13:53:28 $CPG with around a $15 gain between oil prices and extended selling differentials, the company would gain over a billion dollars in annual cashflow. Things could change quickly, very transformingly.

5348 2018-09-24 13:49:38 Price is a measure of value of one thing relative to others, not value itself. You can sit and subjectively assess how valuable oil and grain is all you want, but its still the silo and the tanker that will store that value for you

5378 2018-09-24 13:47:29 Ahhhhhh that's incorrect. Do some homework. Republicans have always been tied into big oil companies like Exxon who received huge tax breaks as a result of this tax scam they passed.
5379 2018-09-24 13:47:05 Sorry.  Google has as greater share of the advertising market than Standard Oil did of the oil market when it was deemed to have too great a share for the good of the market.  Google should be broken up.

5420 2018-09-24 13:42:28 > (without oil) means you can use the quantity you want, cook however you need & no flavour has been lost over time as happens with dried herbs. Can chop them, or remove stems on twiggy herbs like rosemary, before freezing to make it easier to add straight to cooking.
5421 2018-09-24 13:42:25 Recommendations I see are for freezing ‘soft’ herbs, can chop, mix with olive oil & freeze as small cubes so can add to cooking straight from freezer. Dry twiggy herbs like rosemary & basil. I think it depends on how you use the herbs in your cooking though. Freezing all herbs >

5538 2018-09-24 13:30:25 You really aren't paying attention.

Strength of the US dollar has been dependent on a variety of factors. Like all oil trade being in US dollars.

The US has worked very hard to ensure the USD was the currency of international trade.

China has other ideas.

5546 2018-09-24 13:29:30 What are the real reasons for seeking reelection of a party that have thoroughly failed on their own promises. First it was oil subsidy removal and they failed, secondly, the exchange rate reduction and APC failed. Fight against corruption so much noise but nothing concrete.

Chin and Jawline acne is caused by fluctuations in hormones, that means a disruption in your endocrine system, which overstimulates oil glands and clogs pores. Hormones can surge during a menstrual cycle or due to a switch or start with birth control medications.

5551 2018-09-24 13:28:46 Ending US/Iran deal & adding new sanctions of course is helping drive up the price as well- big oil doesn't fund GOP campaigns for $40 oil they do it for $140 oil- pay up suckers

5554 2018-09-24 13:28:34 @barondaytrading The hype about $100 oil is already starting to circulate into financial news media. If this comes to pass...it's surely a great opportunity to scale in shorts? With the dormant shalers likely to come out of hibernation and kill it off before too long. Thoughts?
5555 2018-09-24 13:28:34 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
5556 2018-09-24 13:28:23 But but the oil prices dropped and GM started to make profit with ICE cars so... why make electric.

(I believe Bob Lutz went 180 on Tesla at this point as well)
5557 2018-09-24 13:28:21 The West does not want democracy and human rights to be flourished in oil rich countries along with some others, so that when they feel their world hegemony is threatened somehow, they could find a so-called "legitimate" reason to carry out interventions.

 A study of 160 high school students in Singapore found that high stress doesn’t have an effect on oil production, but it can make acne more serious. The average person touches their face hundreds of times per day, spreading oils and dirt directly into the pores.

5611 2018-09-24 13:22:19 Oil has had an amazing run considering the Perfect Storm of supply the last few years. Shale, fracking, oil sands, horizontal drilling, super fracs, Iran, Iraq, Pre-Salt, Jet Pumps, EV's, higher MPG for car fleet. So oil takes a couple of big shots on the chin & still standing.
5612 2018-09-24 13:22:19 no one is advocating pouring oil on crops... but there's a balance of economic stability and clean energy for feel good motives.

5615 2018-09-24 13:22:10 Talk is cheap.  Producing oil, from shale, isn't. Shale sourced crude is now a major contributor to global supply. OPEC is decreasing in proportion of global supply. Much of OPEC production, from low cost legacy basins, is depleting. Do the math.

5672 2018-09-24 13:16:47 Oil prices keep rising and there’s no reason to be over $60.00 a brl. This is nothing but a Large Tax on the American people. Prices must come down.
5673 2018-09-24 13:16:42 Stay motivated and focused. You may need to review you marketing strategy and your target customers segment. Things will improve going forward. Oman economy improving as oil prices going higher and SMEs should benefits the opportunities created.
5674 2018-09-24 13:16:34 Looks like a bit of a hiccup with with the supporting video at #MSIgnite , wrong stuff played during the Shell oil business video (I don't think meme videos were their AI output)

5677 2018-09-24 13:16:28 Salt and sugar!!!  The only problem with doing it that way is that you have no idea how strong it is.  It's not like you can get the oil out to weigh it and calculate the dose, because you can't get the residue out any other way, this the salt and sugar.  LOL

У нас не было такого, физика меня заинтересовала сама по себе, но я обязательно найду эти эксперименты в сети! Это так прекрасно, когда учителя действительно хотят увлекательно объяснить детям/подросткам науку
5945 2018-09-24 12:47:45 $USO Time to buy oil.  Chart  hitting breakout area, and Saudis and company laughing off Trump. $100 oil again just might happen.
5946 2018-09-24 12:47:40 Macron is the Key for any reconciliation .. but does he want ? 
#Trump wants to Sell his Oil to #EU , #Saudis wants more pressure & sanctions over iran --- to increase the price of oil ( their losses in Yemen 100 billions $, their New vision2030) they need more money
5947 2018-09-24 12:47:25 If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from? @MyJaps #askJulie

5951 2018-09-24 12:47:02 He doesn't though does he. He's got a job and is also quite respected for his history blogging (which is getting him a book deal I think? It certainly should do).

You just troll or make up scare stories (usually about minorities), ignore fact-checking and sell snake oil pills.
5952 2018-09-24 12:46:46 Crude Oil is extracted from earth .. and not produced .. wheras Helicopters, Planes, Ships are manufactured ... we claim to launch satelites .. but can not build aeroplanes why?
5953 2018-09-24 12:46:35 Well, that was the USSR policy for years, with 2-for-1 replacement for all the hardware Egypt & Syria were losing as a result of massive Israeli airstrikes. This certainly contributed to massive economic problems is the USSR, especially in late 80's after the price of oil tanked
5954 2018-09-24 12:46:17 If you are looking for an alternate route for Hwy 106, while it's under construction, Junction Rd is a good detour route. It takes about 10 more minutes, but there is no mud or oil.

5966 2018-09-24 12:45:21 Yup. I can’t imagine anyone could have foreseen the switch from rebel to snake oil salespeople. Tragic.
5967 2018-09-24 12:45:18 $AMRN I honestly thought it wouldn't be a big deal if it works b/c it's just fish oil. Missed a boatload of cash there.
Never write something off because it appears too mundane on the surface...

5972 2018-09-24 12:45:07 Had a person tell me that about Emmy. Like the fuck some orange oil gonna do about a genetic mutation and prenatal skull fusion ya dip?
5973 2018-09-24 12:45:03 Milo was like that the first time. I had to put a drop of oil in my finger and rub it on his gum. He's grown to like it now though.
5974 2018-09-24 12:44:54 Very much like Venezuela when those who knew how to run an oil industry were kicked out or left to be replaced by political appointments. They now produce half the oil with three times the staff.
5975 2018-09-24 12:44:51 Ага. Я помню, мы как-то на уроке спиртовую ракету из пластиковой бутылки запускали. И спирт этиловый до критического состояния доводили. Красиво было. И пару раз даже голлограмки делали.

Как же это было офигенно
5976 2018-09-24 12:44:43 Not going to work. If they stayed with the UK, then technically it would become a principality, and its EEZ would be reduced to 3 miles - the oil would be Scotland's.

5979 2018-09-24 12:44:21 Great question. There are multiple natural cures and preventions. Bitter almonds which are illegal. Cannabis which is illegal. We make Extreme oil, Holy oil and Tincture from cannabis, all of which prevent and/or cure cancer and much more. kimpaddock@ymail.com I'll send info.

5983 2018-09-24 12:43:41 yeah good so far steph.. took me car to the garage this morn, as yesterday discovered an oil leak. I wondered why there was a black trail all over the road.. waiting to hear how much it will cost to fix :(
5984 2018-09-24 12:43:38 Can't see how $AMRN sells enough fish oil to justify its market cap with this gap up. They will have to dazzle us with the secondary endpoints.
5985 2018-09-24 12:43:35 #HedgeFunds reduced their bullish positions on #CrudeOil to the lowest in about a month, weekended #CFTC data revealed, as trade tensions between the United States and China continued to escalate, raising concerns about oil demand in Winter.

5991 2018-09-24 12:42:08 Think the recent Lovaza trial was only 460 mg of EPA per day. This new one looks like it's nearly 4,000 mg per day.

You'd have to take around 20 grams of a average fish oil supplements to get that much EPA.
5992 2018-09-24 12:42:01 I read ya tweets...got an oil change today
5993 2018-09-24 12:41:53 クリームは水中油滴(O/W=Oil in Water)型エマルション、バターは油中水滴(W/O=Water in Oil)型エマルション。クリームを撹拌（チャーニング）すると水相と油相が入れ替わる相転換によりバターができる。
5994 2018-09-24 12:41:32 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
5995 2018-09-24 12:41:32 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5999 2018-09-24 12:41:12 The Alaska dividend does make it more balanced.  If the dividend where tripled, companies might not drill at all.  Alaska residents wouldn't benefit from oil in the ground, if the incentive to drill is not there.  Without dividend, companies might drill more, more jobs.  Depends.

6002 2018-09-24 12:40:40 I don’t have any issue with CBD oil, my issue is the people that can’t just use it and shut up about it. You don’t hear me going around preaching about how amazing 2-ply toilet paper is. I just use it and go about my day because no one cares and if they did they’d ask.
6003 2018-09-24 12:40:28 We’ll see how #Trump “bully” strategy for tariffs & oil work out for #US. Segments of economy are taking serious hit from tariffs & oil is skyrocketing putting pocketbook pinch on gas & heating. If there is a tax cut but it’s eaten up by price increases that is a zero for #US.

Force needs medium to exist.

Force is something that can bd felt.

Gravity can't be felt, so it's fake force.

6085 2018-09-24 12:30:18 Sep.21 (Dow Jones) -- Russia's oil minister flies to Algiers this weekend to meet with Saudi and OPEC counterparts -- a gathering oil traders are watching closely and one that could help solidify Russia's new status as oil-market kingpin.
6086 2018-09-24 12:30:18 Hi @organicCBD :) I read that your cbd oil 10 ml bottke contains 825mg cbd, how much mg is per one drop? or how many drops per one bottle? then i can count myself :)
6087 2018-09-24 12:30:14 These restaurants can do a madness and accommodate to vegan/ vegetarian meal prep by using separate chopping boards and surfaces, but can’t use different oils for Halal chicken?
How are you cooking pork and chicken in the same oil and then claiming the chicken is Halal?¿
6088 2018-09-24 12:29:56 #Iran exports could fall by -1.0 to -1.5 mbpd post sanctions. Oil markets are not prepared for this and cash and curve values are sending clear messages.  #crudeoil
6089 2018-09-24 12:29:55 -- OPEC producers largely agree that oil prices above $80 a barrel would be too high. But there is widespread disagreement on how the cartel and its allies should contain crude prices once U.S. sanctions banning Iranian oil sales take effect in November.
6090 2018-09-24 12:29:53 Let’s just say I can smell the oil already. #ANGS it’s going to be a very BIG flow rate indeed.

6092 2018-09-24 12:29:45 I sleep on the side I had mine done  on and it was such pain for like 3 weeks or when you brush your hair and it gets caught. Keloids also happened but tea tree oil helped me with that
6093 2018-09-24 12:29:40 Oil Producers Debate Best Way to Contain Crude Prices
6094 2018-09-24 12:29:37 not at all!

you blend beetroot, thyme, onion, garlic, red wine vinegar, salt & pepper and you simply mix it with your pasta.

topped with goat cheese, basil and olive oil

making the actual pasta at home is not hard but lengthily - good meditation in between trades though ahah
6095 2018-09-24 12:29:35 @realDonaldTrump guess your threat doesnt work on oil. But good try though.

6126 2018-09-24 12:25:39 This has a real effect on the health of the African countries’ economic prosperity, stripping their governments from any economic authority, because of the loss of control over the oil.

6148 2018-09-24 12:23:12 They can argue as much as they want about that one but they don't have all the data. I however know that my TGs come down significantly if I eat enough OTC fish oil capsules to equal their daily EPA dose. Perhaps I'm just lucky.

6158 2018-09-24 12:21:56 World bank report and imf development reports pre 1970's oil crisis show neoliberalism and capitalism created increased poverty and low redistribution of wealth across the world. You only see the good theres a lot of bad too. One system in one geopolitical area 1/2

6216 2018-09-24 12:14:12 the flow test of the horizontal well,Â  Balcombe-2z, Â has commenced. First hydrocarbons have flowed to surface. Noticed it too. Honey pot overflowing 
6217 2018-09-24 12:14:12 Tell me how an agreement that guarantees the US 3/4 of our oil production no matter what is even in our national interest? Trumps US economy will crash in the next couple years and when it does it will pull us with it. Why tie it closer. Time to walk away and explore other opps.

6227 2018-09-24 12:12:56 No doubt.  The dealer I frequent is decent regarding prices, but some others I've visited were horrible.

6231 2018-09-24 12:12:18 I'm not a vegan but I'm not sure I'm happy about ingesting palm oil, I've stopped buying food containing it. I find it a bit sinister that organizations are promoting it for health reasons when it's only used because its cheap. #PalmOil

6233 2018-09-24 12:12:01 Trade war (inflationary), soaring deficits with more fuel from tax cuts at full employment and now some potential significant crude oil rise with Iran sanctions. What could possibly go wrong, or how to screw up a great bull with policy.

6238 2018-09-24 12:10:43 Mas a Standard Oil era monopólio mas vendia produtos baratos pros consumidores. Então não sei pq fatiaram ela. 
Diz-se até que tinha concorrentes que ficaram ricos montando empresas pra SO comprar depois.

6241 2018-09-24 12:10:32 Mostly because of PTSD. These worthless doctors say there is no cure. But there is. The Extreme oil and the Holy oil, both made with cannabis Indica buds. I used to have severe PTSD and it's gone. I have a friend who is a disabled vet who had it too and now his is gone. DM me.

6252 2018-09-24 12:09:41 Last time we had heating in our block, was 2011. All other owners are pensioners who don't have the money to pay for heating oil.
6253 2018-09-24 12:09:39 But the Government did not generate enough money to pay salaries. And oil money (allocation) coming from the federal government had fallen sharply due to low oil prices.

6262 2018-09-24 12:07:37 Agreed. 

But that's not the point here, since all trials on table had statins as baseline therapy.

2k/year pharma fish oil (which is already funny in light of cheap hi-qual fish oil supplements) destroying an overhyped 15k/year drug on a very hard endpoint (MACE) is fun too 
6263 2018-09-24 12:07:36 Learnt how to work with data to improve oil and gas sector reporting,  the training was organized by @BudgITng and the story I wrote was adjudged the third best

6271 2018-09-24 12:06:54 So happy that I made such good purchases today. Innisfree Color Clay Mask at RM18.61 and Biore Oil Cleanser at RM18.30.
6272 2018-09-24 12:06:48 Oil hit $80 today - a four year high. Trains are ‘bursting at the seams’ buses don’t serve enough rural communities and only three U.K. cities have underground systems, how are we supposed to give up cars and vans? Think this through! @PhilipHammondUK @BorisJohnson @FairFuelUK
6273 2018-09-24 12:06:41 It wasn't socialism at all, though. Same as rape seed oil isn't made by raping seeds.

6274 2018-09-24 12:06:38 Major oil trading houses predict return of $100 crude for 1st time since 2014 as OPEC & its allies struggle to makeup for U.S. sanctions on Iran’s exports.
6275 2018-09-24 12:06:38 Then additional sanctions should extend to those buying that oil !  @POTUS
6276 2018-09-24 12:06:36 In Ontario Big Wind is owned by Big Oil & Coal. The major players in Ontario's  wind industry are fossil fuel corporations like Suncor, Enbridge, TransAlta, Capital Power, Veressen and NextEra. Unreliable wind energy is just an enabler for fossil fuels.
6277 2018-09-24 12:06:26 me and that cocksucker are def doing the tango this morning!!  suckin' on CBD oil like it's water!!

The local electric company committees compelled into going along.
6279 2018-09-24 12:06:12 Yeah, I agree, u ar right. Saraki & people trying to sell Saraki's snake oil to Nigerians do not hav sense.
Nigerians know that 4 Saraki it's all about his inordinate ambition. A man who can betray d secret bond of family & blood bcos of inordinate ambition can not be trusted

6285 2018-09-24 12:05:25 Not a conspiracy nut ... but....... You wonder why a stock that would relinquish control over a portion of the energy sector is being held down? Could it possibly be that it's a direct threat to oil and gas profits? Just a guess...... not saying it's true or not...

6291 2018-09-24 12:04:14 Growth rate of 7%/yr = doubling time of 10 yrs. Each doubling event leads to a total greater than the sum of all doublings prior.

E.G.-oil production grew at 7% until 70s embargo.

That means each decade, we produced more oil than all oil produced in history.

6497 2018-09-24 11:35:08 Now, don’t you think that’s moving the goal post? You stated categorically (without consulting your Oga at the Top) that non appointment of ministers by Buhari led us into recession. You neatly forgot about our depleted foreign reserves. The crash in oil prices.

6545 2018-09-24 11:29:58 An unknown step forwards is generally more damaging than the known step it replaces - for example palm oil as a result of bio-diesel, deforestation to provide biomass as a result of the removal of coal. There is no such thing as green there is only multi-dimensional grey.

Nobody wants to be fodder for a Deep State that is out of control; nobody wants to serve in a limitless war scenario, defending the interests of Big Oil, OPEC, & multinationals (who dodge taxes).

It's probably wise to wait for the official news re #ANGS flowtest result as they tend to go up with ramping only to fall sharply with the results. Lidsey, BB for example

6786 2018-09-24 10:55:12 The prayer, accompanied by an anointing with oil, is offered “in the name of the Lord”; that is, in the Lord’s authority and subject to His will. Prayer is made in full confidence of God’s power to heal.

6793 2018-09-24 10:54:15 I know you weren't expecting oil to go up, but kudos on your lines being meaningful.
6794 2018-09-24 10:54:06 Idea of security that i am talking about goes beyond just the clashes i.e. the recent statement by IS leader Abubaker al-Baghadadi, attack on NOC, warnings by Sanallah that oil and gas infrastructure is under threat if security is not improved .... etc. Clearer now? #Libya

6796 2018-09-24 10:53:26 Here is the context of the verse: “Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
6797 2018-09-24 10:53:20 I simply use apple cider vinegar with olive oil on my salad greens because I like the taste of it.

6806 2018-09-24 10:52:29 Do you never get tired of your own schtick. I can't imagine a guy named Crudehead constantly beating the bullish drum for oil. Go get a real job and quit being worthless to society.
6807 2018-09-24 10:52:17 Not for security reasons though. For political ones. Which is exactly my point. Even if fighting in, say, Tripoli became much worse; how would that impact oil production?

6809 2018-09-24 10:52:10 My specialist is doing this he is encouraging me to use oil when it legalizes of course for pain I have that is a residual symptom.  Cannabis is no better than my current pain medicine and I’m not liking the idea of cannabis

6830 2018-09-24 10:49:33 To make the joke sillier he named himself after the people who were so exploited that slavery was named after them. Russians = Slavs = slave. Slavs are the blacks of Europe. And before he claims Slavs did nothing let me say that Tesla was Slavic. Oil lamps is what he deserves.

6838 2018-09-24 10:48:30 Had enough. Seen enough. We are being mugged. Spirals down and down. If they hit oil you might recover your loss and get out evens. Big question is why is the market continually spiralling down the price despite the buying. Big buys mean we get shafted Worn the tea shirt.

6844 2018-09-24 10:47:40 In 2011 the OECD and IEA signed Accords to promote EV and charging infrastructure.  Big Oil bribed pols to delay.  Climate Scientists did not raise their voices.  We could have had 10% EV by 2015, 40% last year.

6848 2018-09-24 10:47:18 Also beyond my understanding. Earlier when there was subsidy on  these oil marketing  companies cried so much about “loss” which was actual  compensated by government.but media was filled with their quarterly losses.but when they are in profits its no news now.wierd strange
6849 2018-09-24 10:47:15 Why are all folks presuming.  Simple equation INT RATES inversely correlates markets..that's it  OIL high will lead to higher inflation together with INR depreciates thrown in. We is the question of any high movement.

6861 2018-09-24 10:45:43 There is speculation that crude oil prices will break the $100 barrier soon. Government of India wants to cut down on crude oil imports by using strategic reserves. This will be a big blunder and plunder of tax payers money. #PMOIndia #Crudeoil #India #Congress

7039 2018-09-24 10:20:07 What do you know about the oil assets?
7040 2018-09-24 10:20:06 Very true. If we do away with basic tenant of innocent until proven guilty, we are on the slippery slope of a police state.

7045 2018-09-24 10:19:45 To win what? The coalition is recklessly going about ME business adding all manner of cause and effect to an already convoluted and complex mire of theocratically & ethnically oriented governances and a commodity called oil. Where there are no "interests" there's no action.
7046 2018-09-24 10:19:19 but what about

"The Committee also expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook, with an overall healthy balance between supply and demand."

7070 2018-09-24 10:15:38 Oil futures soar to above $80, on tightening supplies. Higher gasoline. prices soon?

7074 2018-09-24 10:15:13 @realDonaldTrump The Security Council meeting on Iran will be held and the regime will be convicted for its crimes. Saudi Arabia and Russia increased oil production, and by November 4, Iran's oil exports will reach zero. China and India need to cut off their oil from Iran,

7080 2018-09-24 10:13:43 Utter Rubbish. Oil companies pay no tax and get subsidised while exploring then, once in production, hide profits off-shore so paying minimal royalties and tax.

7348 2018-09-24 09:32:30 IMO, French desire for oil control may have been stronger than the Brits issues. The independence fighters on the Francophone side apparently had allies on the anglophone side so that may explain 1961.

7592 2018-09-24 08:57:06 During PDP reign crude oil was sold for over 140$ per barrel yet we achieve nothing from them. I gave Buhari 40% in overall performance with 40$-67$ but he can still do more better if we have enough technocrats in his administration come 2019.

7594 2018-09-24 08:56:44 Consider the oil industry - BP & RDS. We need to very quickly reach near-zero oil usage, but employees would vote for unlimited exploration & extraction, for personal benefit.

Problem: if we dry up existing wells, that's already enough for runaway catastrophic warming.

7801 2018-09-24 08:22:05 Oil can help you grow much the same way a garbage heap grows with all kinds of products and services being dumped on us. Meanwhile education helps us develop and this is one of our key missing ingredients that put us where we find ourselves as a nation.

7847 2018-09-24 08:15:54 As an American, I am disappointed you are also a thrall to the oil companies. I expect no less from my government, but I always looked to Canada to lead the way and do the right thing. This is a horrible decision and you need to kill this project.

7850 2018-09-24 08:15:50 @WeekendInvestng r v seeing this as a non visible massive correction like 2008 due to multiple macro factors like debt market crisis, oil, dollar etc or is it just intermittent time wise correction
7851 2018-09-24 08:15:49 Blimey! Couldn't attend an auction so I bid online. I appear to have bought a bureau! This would be great if I wanted a faux,  Queen Anne, walnut veneered, 1930's piece of furniture and not an oil on canvas!
7852 2018-09-24 08:15:29 A good article, but the critical factor it fails to mention is why the West supports the anti-government Sunni rebels. The West wants to please Sunni Saudi Arabia to protect its oil supplies & arms sales to that terror-exporting entity which support jobs in US, UK & France. Evil.
7853 2018-09-24 08:14:58 In 2013 the crude oil was near about 150 dollar per barrel you did mention in your tweet petrol rate is 75 Rs per litre.
In 2018 the crude oil 82 dollar per barrel and Modi Ji govt is selling petrol Rs 82 pet litre.
Dear sir compair this scenario.
7854 2018-09-24 08:14:57 The easiest example I can think of is oil. The price of oil and its production volume rose hand in hand between 2003-2008 until they couldn't.

7893 2018-09-24 08:08:49 I agree that extra virgin olive oil is probably the healthiest fat to cook with. However, the quality of coconut oil matters since there are up to 8 times more polyphenols in virgin coconut oil compared to refined coconut oil.

8013 2018-09-24 07:47:58 It will likely be far more than $8 billion, and all for what negligible iota of change to global emissions? Demand for oil & gas in NZ hasn’t changed so we’ll be just be buying it from overseas instead of supporting our own industry and jobs.

8075 2018-09-24 07:35:40 Nordics have had democratic governments with social policies for the (not) many, hence Norway's sovereign wealth fund from oil revenues rather than UK spending it as revenue. In my view they can not be described as socialist states but do have social policies as do UK

8099 2018-09-24 07:29:58 I prefer ending coal in favor of NG or oil because it is dirtier. And yes, renewables are only beginning and do require storage (which is all that FF is).  But RE has been actively opposed and suppressed.  By my numbers if we diverted all FF subsidies we could do RE in a decade.
8100 2018-09-24 07:29:43 Perhaps so. Aviation is growing fast, but petrochemicals, freight, Asia, etc, are perhaps faster. Oil will be the hardest fossil fuel to replace, as we don't have good alternatives...

8247 2018-09-24 07:07:48 Who else is going to be available for quality goalies? No contending team is trading a goalie midseason, certainly not to a conference rival or without a massive overpayment. You acquire goalies in the offseason, at least quality ones. I mean maybe you get Neuvirth type? Really?

8255 2018-09-24 07:05:58 We've all witnessed how easy it is to trade in a time of desperation. See Hall for Larsson. If the Oilers are 5-10 points out of a playoff spot at American Thanksgiving, you want to give up 1st rounder for a different goalie? What would Bobrovsky cost as a rental? Unrealistic IMO

8518 2018-09-24 06:16:56 Why have you ignored official advice @Megan_Woods @jacindaardern @nzlabour Are you trying to make the country even poorer. Why is there no consultation? We will just import the oil from countries we have no power to regulate.

8523 2018-09-24 06:16:21 Reducing oil prices, developing countries, the economy is weak, and in the modern 100 years, it is a petrochemical product that creates the world economy. OPEC increases oil production. Reduce oil prices.

8529 2018-09-24 06:15:05 Interesting, so you think Talbot is ready to rock for the regular season? Being the clear No. 1, you'd hate to rest him this week then have him struggle out of the gate due to rust, especially in a contract year. That contract year is a huge factor, could go bad in a hurry IMO.
8530 2018-09-24 06:14:54 Oil price hike again?! 
8531 2018-09-24 06:14:51 That's what I use. No coconut butter? MCT oil? Ghee butter? Nuts?
8532 2018-09-24 06:14:49 Does Mercuria have any interests in a higher oil price?

8546 2018-09-24 06:11:22 Agree with your statement but be very careful what you read and may believe that’s written in a right wing paper. Article probably paid for by the Oil Lobby. App called Zap Map shows charge points and details if working or not. And @ecotricity not the best.
8547 2018-09-24 06:11:12 Total has been present in the United Kingdom for more than 50 years and is one of the country’s leading oil and gas operators, with equity production of 171 000 boe/d in the first half of 2018.
8548 2018-09-24 06:11:05 I'd certainly play Koskinen on Tuesday and see no reason for Talbot to start again until they get to Europe
8549 2018-09-24 06:10:28 Well, that's a bit harsh, but thus far a failed experiment but all the weight is on Talbot's shoulders as of today, in a contract year no less. And what if he gets hurt? Goodbye playoff hopes, goodbye Chiarelli!
8550 2018-09-24 06:10:22 Right! If you bothered to fact check instead of taking BS at his word you would know it isnt best economy ever!

8556 2018-09-24 06:09:11 But I don't view those guys pushing anyone and those situations are far different than Edmonton. All three would be considered top end sides for a while now and that isn't the case w/ the Oilers.
8557 2018-09-24 06:09:06 I’m going to go and get some CBD oil to see if it helps with my anxiety
8558 2018-09-24 06:08:58 Exactly, if you believe in Talbot's ability to rebound from a bad year. If he's mediocre (or worse) again, Montoya/Koskinen ain't saving the day. It could end similar to Dubnyk's tenure in Edmonton. Needed to solidify the goaltending position after last season and failed to do so

8571 2018-09-24 06:05:33 I was more so referring to Matt Murray pushing Fleury in Pittsburgh. Juuse Saros pushing Rinne in Nashville. I guess you could include Grubauer with Holtby in Washington. True 1B types, which is what Koskinen was advertised as by Chiarelli. We shall see if he's worth $2.5M.
8572 2018-09-24 06:05:31 Never viewed it as a competition going into camp. Talbot was always going to be the clear No.1 & unless he fell flat on his face, Koskinen was the backup. As far as Montoya goes, I would've been fine w/ him as the No. 2...there were far more pressing needs on this roster.

8580 2018-09-24 06:04:00 In my opinion, Car companies bring transportation to our lives and don't rely on a single source of energy to create the means for that ability.
Oil companies monopolized the energy trade. I don't believe they gain anything going renewable because that directly counters them.

8593 2018-09-24 06:01:53 Or do you come right back with Koskinen on Tuesday at home to Vancouver as make or break game? Three strikes and he's out? But then only two games left before Europe, does Talbot get both and Montoya gets no chance to re-establish himself as backup? Is that fair? Tough call IMO.

8606 2018-09-24 05:58:57 When do you throw Koskinen back in there? The Germany game against another non-NHL calibre opponent? Talbot may want that one too as final tune-up and first test in Europe? So then you're into regular season back-to-backs for Koskinen after long layoff? Does he stand a chance?
8607 2018-09-24 05:58:02 Right time to buy oil. Dont think so. If everything is going so well. Than why this IPO ??

sama seperti Hasjim yang punya saham di oil company di azerbaijan yang profitnya dibawa ke Indonesia, atau dia simpan di SWISS sisanya.
8611 2018-09-24 05:56:25 Will he even get that chance though? I mean Montoya gets one of next three, right? By all accounts, he's outplayed Koskinen in camp thus far and deserves a full game. Looks like Talbot is clear No. 1 again, so need him sharp from Game 1, so he may want/need the other two?
8612 2018-09-24 05:56:10 I will say this about CBD oil/shatter: my disability rating took the night off....I could ruck all 80LBS right now. No Migraine. My foot pain. I feel fucking amazing.

8635 2018-09-24 05:54:03 But a good backup inspires confidence in his teammates and his coach and posts a winning record when called upon. Lots of examples of that, including most playoff teams. Koskinen/Montoya don't fit that bill for Edmonton as of today IMO.

8655 2018-09-24 05:51:21 crude oil price per barrel during GEJ was $100 and pump price was ₦86, Now crude oil is $68 while pump price is ₦145...
With above figures I think NIGERIA economy should still maintain it position but the truth is bad economy policies by @MBuhari killed the economy in No time.

8657 2018-09-24 05:51:19 Small sample size in preseason but there is no way to even contemplate Koskinen as the 2019-20 starter at this point. Right now, he'll be lucky to be the 2018-19 backup and not a 1B like hoped/touted but a clear No. 2 with limited action. Not looking NHL calibre thus far IMO.
8658 2018-09-24 05:51:19 Major oil trading houses are heralding the return of $100 crude for the first time since 2014 as the market awaits the potential loss of Iranian supplies because of U.S. sanctions.

8666 2018-09-24 05:49:41 In all honesty man, show me these goalies who are being pushed. Just b/c a team has a good backup doesnt mean they are pushing the starter. That's just a GM doing a good job putting together his roster. A legit No. 1 doesn't need pushing.

8680 2018-09-24 05:47:43 @SecPompeo Qatar and Iran are working to support armed militias in the Middle East, and America must work to secure Qatari gas, secure Iraqi oil from Iran's agents and prevent Iran from stealing Iraq's wealth.

8682 2018-09-24 05:47:28 Nilsson got hot but Talbot had some stinkers in there too that caused him to lose the net if I remember correctly. He would have lost the net last season if Brossoit or Montoya proved capable/got hot. Is Koskinen capable? Jury is out but so far looking like a big NO.

8691 2018-09-24 05:45:47 Also, the thing people always forget about that season is Talbot was real good in 4 of his first 5 starts & followed it up w/ a poor 10 day stretch. He barely played when Nilsson was hot & was real good the rest of the way. Goaltending wasnt a problem for the Oilers in '15-16.

8694 2018-09-24 05:45:30 Maybe not a platoon, but certainly definition of pushing Talbot when you steal the crease for that length of time and play consistent enough to allow him to get his game in order in practice. Didn't have that luxury last season and Koskinen not instilling that kind of confidence.

8699 2018-09-24 05:44:25 The oil price has been rising since 2016 and is currently around $80 a barrel. It will continue to rise and fall in the future. Independent Scotland can't rely on oil revenues, but it can benefit from them in the short term and invest in sustainable energy production.

8715 2018-09-24 05:42:12 World oil demand will peak at 104.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in the mid-2030s, up from just below 100 million bpd currently, as new technologies gradually eat into oil use, China's Unipec said on Monday.
8716 2018-09-24 05:42:08 I have a spray bottle mixed with coconut oil, tea tree oil, olive oil, and water. I just put that in every morning on my roots
8717 2018-09-24 05:41:46 O caso Rockfeller é um excelente ponto de partida para o assunto, não apenas pela formação do cartel, mas também devido a lei antitruste.
Os outros exemplos que foram citados anteriormente são ótimos, mas historicamente falando ainda não se comparam ao da Standard Oil.
8718 2018-09-24 05:41:41 I wonder why the government is not thinking. A plan too use the water new lakes and send it to the ones need west coast. build power plant. If we can move oil why not water. Look destruction, loosing it all too start all over again. Can some one think about our future. Save that
8719 2018-09-24 05:41:21 Shipping manifests reveal that quantities of honey, rum, whale oil, and other commodities were shipped by the “bbl” – well before John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil’s blue barrels.

8721 2018-09-24 05:40:52 Probably. They are attacking the oil tanks. The photos of the scene on the street show insane men-paranoid schizophrenia, paranoia, sadism, manic-depression PTSD run rife, turning men into Zombies or Vampires

8727 2018-09-24 05:39:52 However, while Ida Tarbell’s 1904 Standard Oil Company history acknowledged the "holy blue barrel", the abbreviation “bbl” had been in use well before the 1859 birth of the U.S. petroleum industry.

8746 2018-09-24 05:35:15 Get some cedar wood oil and rub it on he bottom of your big toe before you go to bed. It seriously works. At least it did for me. It’s very calming and helps me fall asleep and stay asleep.
8747 2018-09-24 05:35:06 I have used that, I guess it didn't help the frizz so much. I have used moraccan oil too...maybe I am just doing it all wrong

8774 2018-09-24 05:29:53 Oh, no! I have bought things I didn’t want to before for sure. I’ve also learned the hard away about things like “come to our meeting for a free set of cookware.”  I still have some “Seacret” Dead Sea cuticle oil (?) I got scammed into at the mall once, actually.
8775 2018-09-24 05:29:41 The only issue w/ the gamble was the $2.5M but that's it. It was dumb at the time & even if it works out it was a dumb. As far as on the cheap goes, I'm referring to the 2019-20 season.
8776 2018-09-24 05:29:33 yun mga neighbors natin sa region wala masyado adverse reaction ang oil prices , tayo nag taasan basic commodities, surge inflation, at unemployment hindi lang sa labgis yan but something is wrong with management of the economy

8803 2018-09-24 05:25:16 For the back half of the season once the games were meaningless with McDavid hurt and Oilers out of playoff race. When the games and points in the standings mattered, they were platooning and Nilsson was absolutely pushing Talbot, if not outplaying him through 30-40 games.

Do we buy oil from them?
Is that why gasoline  prices are increasing?

8824 2018-09-24 05:23:39 Do you trust Koskinen playing 25 games based on what we've seen? And trust him to be the 2019-20 starter while letting Talbot walk as a UFA? And what is the definition of "on the cheap"? I mean $2.5M for an unproven backup doesn't fit that bill. This gamble is trending badly.

8876 2018-09-24 05:16:13 This is patently false. I certainly didn’t save $1900 and my tax burden may larger this year. Your number is dishonest and it works like this: one ultra-rich oil company executive gets a $180,000 tax cut and 100 working people get a $100 cut, that’s an avg of $1900 per person.

It's such a ridiculous statement to make as the airport is not worth above 500 crore while oil tax has been 8 or 9 lakh crores in 4 years.

Bhakts really get easily fooled if even a 100 rs project is completed.
9023 2018-09-24 04:53:40 Oil prices rising. . .Rumps tariff wars killing the farmers. . massive tax cuts to the 1% . . .wages going down for the rest of us. . .interest rates going up. Hold on people.

9081 2018-09-24 04:39:59 And that is the real reason that the Republican Party makes trouble in other countries with oil. If they can shut it off, supply goes down, prices at the pump go up, and so do oil company profits.

9111 2018-09-24 04:35:26 Try rice water with tea tree oil. Put rice in water leave it for at least 40 mins. Drain the water into other bowl than add tea tree oil. Message into your hair three times a week and it should help.

9118 2018-09-24 04:34:37 Oil prices are trading higher today, after OPEC said over the weekend that the group would only raise output if customers requested it, as Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies stopped short of promising specific extra volumes of crude.

9158 2018-09-24 04:24:35 Tax Authorities could not encash the opportunity of bumper harvesting of Tax money and unearthing of blackmoney from information generated by demonetisation. Where has gone the benefits of subsidy saved on LPG,fertilizers,and PDS? What happened to money extorted as excise on oil.

9358 2018-09-24 03:45:21 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

9360 2018-09-24 03:45:04 I agree. All of these standards are flexible & allow the SEC to choose a desired outcome & fit the legal analysis to it afterward. 

Everything is political in the end. Gold, oil, forex, etc. have long worked for the incumbents, so they're approved. Bitcoin doesn't, so it's not.

9363 2018-09-24 03:44:34 heh - forgotten & left on high taco shell oil was my [failed] attempt to burn down the kitchen in the 70's - all I did was destroy the astroturf in the atrium I flung it at - upper stove/ceiling were left unmarked ;-p
9364 2018-09-24 03:44:30 #4A The results from my "health trend" poll concluded that most people would try intermittent fasting with 43% of the votes with CBD oil coming in next. Drinking bulletproof coffee and bone broth tied for 3rd place. #TWUHS4363

9369 2018-09-24 03:43:32 We sure had not many hours on small animal nutrition at vet school but I really can not remember canola oil was recommended as best option for dogs! ;-)

Was the nutritionist worried of dogs LDL?
9370 2018-09-24 03:43:20 Dude it’s over, still no oil  go to gym try to Achieve a realistic goal
9371 2018-09-24 03:43:08 Humm,David Adeleke aka davido learn how to post in public because ur career people watching and listening. Don't deep ur hand into the red oil because u want to eat yam. Becareful
9372 2018-09-24 03:43:08 Its worth noting that Lorenzos oil was developed by citizens crunching the research.. other areas need this due to underfunding. Both r good
9373 2018-09-24 03:43:07 My brother to his daughter, EVERY CALL, “did you change your oil???”
9374 2018-09-24 03:43:00 When you’re in desperate need of your witch hazel, acne treatment, and hair oil and they are all at your house but you’re staying that night with your boo 
9375 2018-09-24 03:42:55 @iamjohnoliver why don't you do a show on carbon recycling and oil companies versus our environment. Love your show

9377 2018-09-24 03:42:37 Not true Trevor. Eliminate the Carbon Tax. Grow Oilsands/Heavy Oil production to 10M bpd concurrent with partial Upgraders. Maintenance then sustains jobs. Revenues stay high throughout. Sustainable for more than 200 years at least.
9378 2018-09-24 03:42:33 I need my eyelash extensions back fuck this castor oil method.
9379 2018-09-24 03:42:13 night∞シリーズは聴いてたな
9380 2018-09-24 03:41:58 You mean extremely curly but not frizzy?
Oil your hair twice a week night before washing, replace towels with T-shirt, do not rub your hair while retaining water, continuously use conditioner, try to find and use leave-in conditioner, use wide toothed comb (not brush)
9381 2018-09-24 03:41:52 I put vitamin E oil on my face tonight and my biggest fear is that I’m going to wake up and my skin is going to be super irritated and red!!
9382 2018-09-24 03:41:52 Let’s not blame Ford solely for the lack of green initiatives. If people want to be energy efficient, why can’t it be done without taxpayers dollars? Look at Trudeau who will be spending billions on a new oil pipeline out West. Why aren’t you vocal about that?
9383 2018-09-24 03:41:46 Just happy to see the Pats leaking some oil is all..
9384 2018-09-24 03:41:42 Week of 9/23 in Pisces: Find the silver horse in the drawer. It will be the one that is old and worn out. Brush it with lilac oil. If you want it to it will come alive.
9385 2018-09-24 03:41:41 Thank you love!!! I wash my face with African black soap and then moisturize with a mix of vitamin E oil, grapeseed oil, and rose water. And drinking lots of water daily.
9386 2018-09-24 03:41:21 Is it weird that even though I'm not sleeping, I feel like I could pull my hair out, do 20 jumping jacks, change the oil in my car and I still wouldn't be tired?!??!
9387 2018-09-24 03:41:21 青眼が気になる
9388 2018-09-24 03:41:20 Saudi child to the older man remember you would have nothing cause it was America's technology that got that oil out for you and not your damn camels riding country men. You didn't know what oil was . You thought  about the Tar Pits and their Danger .
9389 2018-09-24 03:40:49 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
9390 2018-09-24 03:40:49 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9391 2018-09-24 03:40:38 Like the treasure hidden in the earth,

9394 2018-09-24 03:40:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
9395 2018-09-24 03:40:00 I called them to complain and they said some “oh no that needs to get fixed, being the car in and we’ll take a look at it” .. like um what?? Y’all better fix my car and refund me for that wack oil change!
9396 2018-09-24 03:39:56 I just gave them a bath and covered them in coconut & oregano oil, I’ll try that too. What did she do to get rid of fleas around the house? I want to make sure this NEVER comes back.
9397 2018-09-24 03:39:49 Fox News Anchors know that when the President issues alternative facts, a sad wolf cries for mama #resist
9398 2018-09-24 03:39:47 But if it was cancer, the tea tree oil got rid of it completely. I asked the Australian team about it and they told me not to be crazy and not to put it anywhere near my eye. I got the answer after the whole thing was over.
Like I said, don't try this at home.
9399 2018-09-24 03:39:42 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
9400 2018-09-24 03:39:19 So I definitely lost my oil pen at either Crickets or GFR but I don't have the courage to ask if they had found a lost vape pen with illicit substances in it. It's just too much for my pure, Buddhist soul.
9401 2018-09-24 03:39:08 Bumili ako ng electric razor sa Lazada. The photos online show a small bottle of oil but my package didn't have it. I asked why and the seller was like:

"Meron po yan, please check nyo po."

... Girl, ano na? Magpipilitan tayo kung meron o wala? WALA NGA TEH KAYA AKO NAGTANONG

9404 2018-09-24 03:38:45 Someone forgot to oil the #AnnBot and now she's stuck...
9405 2018-09-24 03:38:15 Ugh I’m trying out stuff to find out what I am gonna do for the winter so I tried almond oil and vitamin E oil and it worked.....until I stepped in a puddle.
9406 2018-09-24 03:38:14 Alberta in particular doesn't need a Carbon Tax nor a Sales Tax in order to have a strong economy.

What we need is a sustained Oilsands/Heavy Oil development growth taking us to 10M bpd. Concurrent with Partial Upgraders to match. At around that point, Maintenance sustains jobs.
9407 2018-09-24 03:38:03 My baby had it coconut oil massage wash with shampoo lightly brush or all his hair will come out
9408 2018-09-24 03:38:02 เคมียังมีความหวังมากกว่า
9409 2018-09-24 03:37:59 I keep my twist in for at least 2-3 days and just keep putting oil in my hair. Twist outs look so good after the 2nd day

9488 2018-09-24 03:24:38 I did twist out and braid out throughout my entire transition period since my hair was too short for perm and flexi rods. I used cantu shea butter line and the shea moisture jamaican black castor oil line. Deep condition every wash. Occasionally co washed between washes.

9491 2018-09-24 03:24:22 America is not in Somalia because Somalia has no oil & gold like Libya & Iran. America she goes where she gets something bigger in return. You can not separate America from worldly assets like oil.
9492 2018-09-24 03:24:17 Oil? No.

Digital? ...maybe...
9493 2018-09-24 03:24:11 Sheesh! That’s all there was to it? So, Standard Oil, Du Pont & General Motors began producing large quantities tetraethyl lead to feed the Luftwaffe’s needs & are thereby responsible for causing WWII? Did I get that right? That is what you’re claiming? Right?
9494 2018-09-24 03:23:52 God forbid it’s derived from dirty Canadian oil!
9495 2018-09-24 03:23:50 I just googled it, I added an extra t. It’s roti. Looks like it’s just flour, oil, water, and salt.

9503 2018-09-24 03:23:26 Trudeau has NO intention to help the Oil & Gas sector (or do anything about NAFTA, and on and on). He is definitely influenced by, and probably being tutored and directed by George Soros and the new world socialist agenda. Our only hope is that we will get a new govt next year.
9504 2018-09-24 03:23:24 I’m concerned with over-washing my face because it’s sensitive and dry but then I’m like am I just letting oil sit there for much longer than I should??? Is there even an answer????

9520 2018-09-24 03:21:34 Dang. If you had some you can let it sit where the pain of infection is and the alcohol would pull it out. Numb it for the rest of the night. Hmmm. Do you have vanilla flavor or some mineral oil and cotton balls
9521 2018-09-24 03:21:33 5 wise and 5 foolish. 
Just as the Menorah would burn night and day, it would eventually run out of oil if not replenished. We are to replenish our temple with the oil by reading the word of God. 

The 5 wise knew Him, the 5 foolish knew Him, but He didn’t know them.

9529 2018-09-24 03:20:27 So my night went like this: an hour after I went to sleep cats smashed a bottle of oil all over the kitchen. Clean glass, put newspaper down to soak oil. As I get to sleep kid wakes up screaming for me and needs to pee. Storm hits at 1am, hysterical dogs.
9530 2018-09-24 03:20:21 Maybe it’s the oil... i have some stomach trouble when I eat too much of something or if it’s too oily and stuff
9531 2018-09-24 03:20:16 Lol well that’s good you produce a lot of oil in that arid climate. I was scaly when I lived in the desert. I’m lucky my tats didn’t flake off

9535 2018-09-24 03:19:54 Very accurate assessment. "drop in the ocean". If action to reduce plastics in ocean I know a faster way. Plastics are made from oil, oil is organic compound, all plastics organic compounds w/ lots of micronutrients, proper disposal, compost. local use. Oceans clean themselves.
9536 2018-09-24 03:19:50 tbh i didn't mind the smell much but the face cream was the absolute worst... i got my face scanned for grease, sun damage, etc and the cream ruined the results because it didn't actually absorbed into my skin and it showed up as oil all over my face!!! would not recommend
9537 2018-09-24 03:19:30 So China expects oil demand to slow dramatically based on this chart? Currently growing 1.5-1.8mmbpd/year to 0.275mmbpd/year With demand at 100mmbpd already & next years growth expected to be 1.5mmbpd. Hard to believe expected growth is to slow to 0.200mmbpd/year until 2035.

9775 2018-09-24 02:43:44 What they fail to realize is, that’s not gonna sell them units. When low-to-mid income consumers realize that oil changes are $200 and brake changes are $1100, those “cheap” cars going back to the dealership

9779 2018-09-24 02:43:35 Yes there is. You’re literally describing one right now. Trying to gain an advantage over China by spending trillions on a new toy is, in fact, an arms race. And we’re literally invading 8 different countries in the Middle East for their oil. How are you oblivious to that?
9780 2018-09-24 02:43:34 I’m with you! If it provides some relief, count me in. I like CBD oil in small doses. It’s a good anti-inflammatory.

9800 2018-09-24 02:40:28 Its hemp oil. not snake oil. Hemp is legal. CBD oil commonly from Cannabis is different product. Its marketed this way to avoid issue with GW Pharma. I took a spec position Friday to hold for US IPO.

9807 2018-09-24 02:38:24 thank you! I love oregano oil & ginger is really helpful as well as yarrow. I’ve had lots of trouble with my lungs & breathing & doctors haven’t been very helpful for chronic problems even when I was in the hospital
9808 2018-09-24 02:37:24 อยากเสียวด้วยคับ
9809 2018-09-24 02:37:24 Yes! It’s a must. Scrub it, water and a rough pad. Then pick a good seasoning oil. I used a mix of veggie oil or flax oil (high smoke point). Rub it down, just so it’s coated, no excess. Then bake it at the highest temp your oven can go for a hour or so. Leave in til it’s cool.

9819 2018-09-24 02:34:34 Mike thought it’d be okay if he used olive oil in the brownies in place of vegetable oil... I made the mistake of trying them. The taste compares to motor oil (I think).

9836 2018-09-24 02:32:31 Subsidies for the Oil Companies and now Farmers because of Trumps Tariffs. That is Socialism.
9837 2018-09-24 02:32:24 how about: stagflation may have preceded the oil shocks but the oil shocks really made stagnation acute; so the intellectual shift was opportunistic — to endogenise stagflation in the supply side of the economy when in fact its severity  was primarily due to an exogenous shock

9843 2018-09-24 02:31:18 Only  Dr. man mohan singh controlled international crud oil prices. And madam irani sent sari and chudi to him for failing to reduce the inflation. Have Shame on double standard.
9844 2018-09-24 02:31:05 What damage? All I’ve seen is Trump has removed our dependency on foreign oil which has caused our US oil export to skyrocket and caused our economy to hit record highs. What damage are you talking about?

9855 2018-09-24 02:30:00 I get that oil companies want to make a ton of money but...wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper for them to start investing in other sources of energy? From what I’ve read digging for oil is expensive. Solar power is easily accessible and will be for a damn long while. Just saying.
9856 2018-09-24 02:29:40 Autumn is a busy time for me. Of course, being so introverted that Hawking revised his black hole theory doesn't help my tweeting, either. In medical stuff - found a CBD oil with no THC that works for my fibromyalgia and hip pain. Whee.
9857 2018-09-24 02:29:29 Skyn is a nice choice. 
But original Triscut for both boxes? Live a little! My favorite is Rosemary and Olive Oil.
9858 2018-09-24 02:29:28 Fresh peanut butter does bc all it is is ground up peanuts with no preservatives. You have the keep it in the fridge or it’ll go rancid. Also, when you first buy it, all the oil has settled on the top and you have to mix it together. I like the packed with preservatives kind.

9867 2018-09-24 02:27:43 Crude oil market balance; “Some 600 MBD shot of supply as per  Oman oil minister”. Hint; during 2019 oil supply will be even tighter as shale oil has most likely reached its peak production and is getting ready to sharply decline. Oil barrel may see $100+ sooner than expected...

9880 2018-09-24 02:25:51 Green supporters are against fracking (onshore) in Victoria but more than happy to buy products that come from fracked wells. Great to see a party that spreads lies based on hyped up american anti shale gas/oil movies.

9883 2018-09-24 02:25:35 CBD oil is a winner. My mother suffers from chronic migraines and she has started using that. So far it’s worked pretty well
9884 2018-09-24 02:25:30 No matter how much it is abused, it is less than oil subsidies for oil companies or subsidies for war related industries.

9903 2018-09-24 02:22:20 I don’t think they really care about “culture.”   But the ability to neuter government’s ability to act as a check on Capital is paramount.  “[C]ulture” is just selling snake oil to the rubes.

9905 2018-09-24 02:22:05 I like to bake tofu in the oven, just oil the baking sheet a bit, then I use that in salads or dip it in BBQ sauce & just eat it. Or make stir fry! Sautée the tofu in teriyaki sauce, then add veggies & eat over rice.
9906 2018-09-24 02:21:55 About 15 min in a big pot. I just leave the leaves wet after they’ve been rinsed. A splash of oil and vinegar and there’s more than enough to get the leaves wilted, but not too far.

It was 1995 in Boulder, CO so of course I was down.

9922 2018-09-24 02:20:20 And that was during an economic downturn after the oil bust. It was reasonable ffers MIGHT have been laid off. Now Houston is rated one of the three fastest growing economies and booming population growth. This is manufactured panic. Where is the money?
9923 2018-09-24 02:20:02 Our actions? You mean exporting 20% of our oil from there and lifting it from 3rd world status? Our comfortable living didn’t happen over night we’ve been working on it over 200yrs but a decade of socialist programs will destroy everything! T
9924 2018-09-24 02:19:54 The problem being USA doesn’t have capitalism. Everything we try to point to looks a lot like statism because it is. Farming, oil and gas, tech, all of these businesses are state benefactors. If we had ascribed to #capitalism, every big biz dominating our economy wouldn’t exist.
9925 2018-09-24 02:19:35 Why not focus on developing the oil and gas industry in Canada and building pipelines - something completely within our control (as opposed to trying to manage the earth’s climate)?
9926 2018-09-24 02:19:31 As much as you won’t entertain any other concerns other than the pader. Juzkoh yung pader ang pinaglalaban, hindi yung karapatang pantaong nilalabag ng rehimeng Dutae.
9927 2018-09-24 02:19:28 that was not an opinion, it was a statement of facts, of the situation then.
9928 2018-09-24 02:19:25 I'm sorry... try something holistic. I never go to a doctor except to see my kids that are MD's...they all scold me for my lack of regular doctor visits. I just do shrooms, oregano oil infusion and Braggs vinegar. 66 and so okay. Hope you find a solution.

9930 2018-09-24 02:19:22 Looks like broccoli, spinach, artichoke, cherry tomatoes, white onion, pepper, oil?
9931 2018-09-24 02:19:17 Better get more oil for the lamp you borrowed from Diogenes.
9932 2018-09-24 02:19:15 The only thing I hate about moisturizing & sealing my hair is the oil bothers me unless I cover my hair for a whileeeee after.

9961 2018-09-24 02:14:36 Greetings, it's Olive Oil. I've been musing if after all these decades you'd like to rely on that body-ody-ody.

9979 2018-09-24 02:11:58 It takes a little bit, but my fav is to press it, then freeze it, then dry it with towels again and toss it in tamari, oil, garlic, and flour, bake it at 350 for 30-40mins, then add to stir fry. It's an overnight process, but it tastes like heaven.
9980 2018-09-24 02:11:56 I just fry it on a wok until each side is nice and golden brown and then add some sauce to caramelize it, Trader Joe’s island soyaki is dope for this. It still uses oil but you only need a little bit

10003 2018-09-24 02:08:12 Standard Oil and Ma Bell were private firms, but our duly elected government decided it was in America's interest to break them up.
