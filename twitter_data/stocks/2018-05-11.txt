6 2018-05-13 23:54:28 I told you in April, May would be a great month for stocks because hedge funds were so underweight equities and would play catch up and May so far has been exceptional for stocks. Now hedge funds are rotating money into value stocks and selling growth stocks, so big shift coming.
7 2018-05-13 23:54:04 So in Sweden you have much more local political involvement from the ground up; people are not nearly as distrustful of the system and they take action, they vote, old people and young.

12 2018-05-13 23:50:45 Insurance stocks soared after #ACA: it guaranteed unlimited supply of powerless paying customers. In a normal world (aka non-profit insurance companies) it would be called financial hostage taking.
13 2018-05-13 23:50:41 To everyone who thinks I'm "hating" on forex, day trading or penny stocks, I'm really not. The laws of money will never change. Chasing quick money and get rich quick schemes will ALWAYS result in you in losing everything and then you'll think that ALL investing is a scam.
14 2018-05-13 23:49:19 Yea, you sound like a road scholar.  Buy stocks then.  Does someone help you go to the bathroom also?
15 2018-05-13 23:46:00 You and her have become laughing stocks....you are both out to make a dollar no matter who you bring down in the meantime.....smh....
16 2018-05-13 23:45:05 Yeah but they always have to OD on the price to keep the prestige of the brand name up. It’s kinda why brands like Chanel and LV burn their leftover stocks instead of lowering a the price or offering a sale

40 2018-05-13 23:32:03 Diversify your investments into a broad mix of stocks and bonds. Most times being diversified will be safer than owning one stock or bond in your portfolio. #Wealth #investments

54 2018-05-13 23:18:10 Hello and welcome to  CNN. This is  pam with the latest business news. The Politics Haters are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  EBAY stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNN.
55 2018-05-13 23:15:36 Yes. Less than 100 stocks as of now.
56 2018-05-13 23:14:32 Real stocks grind a hell of a lot more in my experience which is the main reason why I don't trade them.  For instance a stock with shit earnings could have Carl Icahn's firm think it's a value buy and randomly place a huge iceberg order throughout the day and destroy your short.
57 2018-05-13 23:13:37 Hi , What program did you use to create this chart that shows YTD performance for multiple stocks ?
58 2018-05-13 23:12:02 EU MiFID II regulations are really screwing things up for investors and those with their own pensions in the UK. The regulations have prevented brokers from continuing to offer non-UCITS funds and ETFs that have more diversity and less risk. How idiotic is that? Yet stocks fine.

62 2018-05-13 23:09:19 Thank you hun
63 2018-05-13 23:07:51 Well done Tom! It was a really great night 
64 2018-05-13 23:06:42 Yes, I was for about 5 days. I was with 4 chatrooms. All focused on Penny Stocks, I studied penny stocks for 12mos prior to making a SINGLE trade - spent 4 mos trading later - came to a quick realization that those rooms did not fit my goal. I wont stay if they dont provide...
65 2018-05-13 23:05:33 Hi madaz, hope you had a few days to decompress. Not here to tell you what to do, plenty have/will do that.

My only observation... The 'grindy chop fest' you see is in the small cap, low floats. Keep that in mind. Very different with real stocks with real catalysts.
66 2018-05-13 23:05:11 My stocks bought me a new house. #MAGA. You shouldn't judge someone by the color of their skin, it's kind of racist.
67 2018-05-13 23:04:03 Wonder if trump owns any oil stocks?
68 2018-05-13 23:02:57 Man, I was damning to witness live...he could not spread at all...they way ruckman are utilised in this era - our stocks are piss troughs

71 2018-05-13 22:57:18 What's amazing is most of the $1.5 TRILLION will probably be borrowed from China. Corporations are benefiting the most and putting the money into stock buy backs that benefit shareholders. About 30% of stocks are held by foreigners - probably a good chunk of which are Chinese.

75 2018-05-13 22:46:39 I LOVE WORKING ON WEEKENDS!

Here's Why.. 

As a trader, it’s critically important that ur prepared for the upcoming trading week. Over my 6 years of trading #Forex #Stocks, I found the best time to do analysis & make trading decisions, is when the markets are actually CLOSED.
76 2018-05-13 22:44:54 Ben, c'est pas totalement faux sur ce point. Taxer l'objet robot c'est pas définissable. Si on veut être logiques on parle de taxer des stocks et des flux économiques, qu'on doit alors définir (issus de quelle activité, en quels lieux etc)
77 2018-05-13 22:44:30 Seems a bit extreme... how about the stocks instead
78 2018-05-13 22:43:42 Got stocks in the company, Donald?

81 2018-05-13 22:39:25 It's like forex trader says it is not possible to make money on stocks... just let people do what they are good at.
82 2018-05-13 22:39:12 In Twitter size; without such decomoditiziation or definancialization if you wish, housing is just another financial asset whose expected return will be compared to stocks and bonds and investment demand is effectively infinite if expected yield is relatively high. End
83 2018-05-13 22:34:30 Do you think Trump doesn't have Michael Cohen type clandestine stock traders buying long and selling short various stocks preceding market changing comments from POTUS? That is even better than having tomorrow's Wall Street Journal, today. #MuellerIsComing #MuellerInvestigation
84 2018-05-13 22:32:41 I wanted to trade outside of normal market hours (outside of stocks). Was going to do Forex until someone introduced me to crypto & I saw the volatility of it.

88 2018-05-13 22:27:44 The US market has its best week in two months as stocks edged higher on Friday, with a growing view that inflation remains under control. Catalysts supporting the market at present include strong US company earnings, moderate inflation & easing global trade tensions.
89 2018-05-13 22:24:52 Rofl if I could just seal stocks I’d own the Marth ditto 

But I give up the stupidest stocks instead
90 2018-05-13 22:24:32 Yes, indexes are re-balanced to include the best performing stocks. One of the few opportunities to play with the system, not against it. Patience, the hardest strategy to master.
91 2018-05-13 22:23:41 once more WB stabs the tv side in the back.. for what? their films? laughing stocks honestly.  or maybe it's jealously that the TV side nails the characters while the movies flounder about... since honestly Suicide Squad joker was hot garbage..

93 2018-05-13 22:21:08 Here’s what we know: no previous administration, no previous congress, has had any success at all in controlling drug prices. Stock price action means nothing b/c those stocks are so beaten down, that simply getting a plan out there provides relief to markets. Don’t be naive.
94 2018-05-13 22:18:06 Don't play the penny stocks.
95 2018-05-13 22:17:59 this area: deceptive stocks.  If you have thoughts/videos ready on it, it would be fantastic.  GL - you will be back.

98 2018-05-13 22:15:15 Agree, what I believe is there are indicators whose readings lead to get an idea to future economic wealth of a country which is reflected by stocks in some cases. Eg us gdp versus s&p returns

111 2018-05-13 22:05:19 That is true. I do think that it's popularity will start to decrease in the future, but even if it does, I'm pretty sure the company owns Instagram, so that will help their stocks as that seems to be in it's prime. Time will tell I guess
112 2018-05-13 22:04:49 So he came  back with nothing no good DD on value of stock nothing that would make me sell I could show him a 100 charts where stocks went down lol look at google look at apple look at Twitter haha weak hes not even good at this
113 2018-05-13 22:03:42 Those people aren't looking at what's happening only listening to the talking points. The tax plan failed to deliver on every promise. Corps are buying back stocks & we have $1.5t+ in new debt for that. GDP is still subpar. This will likely collapse badly.

120 2018-05-13 21:56:43 1. One of Trump's 1st actions was to undo the fiduciary rule that said financial advisors must act in the best interest of the client

It was instituted b/c many Fin Advisors were recommendng stocks based on what kind of commisson the stock paid, instead of what the client needed
121 2018-05-13 21:56:15 That is just SCARY. There would be town stocks and a cutty stool for sure.

158 2018-05-13 21:17:56 It's greed to want to get paid more but it's not greed to want to steal what someone else earned?  Those greedy CEOs don't swim in piles of money like Scrooge McDuck.  They invest back into the economy.  Most of their wealth is in stocks so it's paying other people's salaries.

160 2018-05-13 21:13:24 But when looking at a broader index, Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, it’s clear U.S. stocks haven’t rallied as robustly as their foreign equivalents. Trump’s been touting the stock market growth since February, but in November the S&P still lagged behind Japan,
161 2018-05-13 21:10:30 @MartinSLewis @asda advertising rollback or special offers but not actually having stocks in their stores, is this common practice? Do this not breach trading standards?

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

206 2018-05-13 20:10:00 I don't know. Judging from Trump' s creampuff speech on drug prices, which triggered a big rally of drug stocks, it looks like Novartis might have gotten their money's worth.

214 2018-05-13 20:00:26 How management communicates mistakes is very important.

276 2018-05-13 19:04:08 I give you bump stocks, though they look like fun I can do without. But try buying a weapon yourself, you'll see is not as "easy" as ppl say.
277 2018-05-13 19:01:48 are you just doing stocks or do you have a  job

287 2018-05-13 18:55:06 North Korea tensions send stocks spiraling down.

288 2018-05-13 18:52:18 So Trump puts forth a Drug Bill......and the stocks of the drug companies head into the stratosphere.  Guess who's going to get screwed....again.  If he wants REAL change.....he should allow Medicare to negotiate better drug prices....but the lobbyists won't allow it! BOHICA!
289 2018-05-13 18:52:05 Why does #SteveSisolak LIE in his commercial about how he's going to "ban bump stocks" if elected governor? Doesn't he know the PRESIDENT already did that by executive order?

297 2018-05-13 18:45:41 Anyway, someone as risk averse as @Nouriel will never embrace any crypto in a million years. He still believes that "buying and selling individual stocks is a waste of time" and he probably keeps his life savings under the mattress.
298 2018-05-13 18:44:49 Very interesting week for some of my stocks. N has had a wild come back. Ceo has galvanized the share holders to fight the short attack. I would expect and hope steady gains there.

305 2018-05-13 18:41:45 It’s illegal to modify a gun to fully automatic. If you’re speaking about bump stocks, I’m fine with them being banned. They are shit for aiming. Because then it actually does produce recoil. But I mean my handgun holds 15 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. I can empty that in seconds
306 2018-05-13 18:40:46 Sounds exactly like the way penny/pink sheet stocks pay people for promotion so the company can sell shares to raise capital. Pump and dump, and the shareholders get left holding the bag.

1) Know the business and not worry about the price 
2) Be patient and don't be hasty 
3) Pick your best stocks, have faith and watch them grow
4) Do your homework
318 2018-05-13 18:33:12 AND I don't have everything in stocks. And you ignore BF completely because you seem to want to ignore and not research defensive stocks, too.

321 2018-05-13 18:30:36 in ~theory~ stocks would be good for average people so they could share and have say in business dealings but in practice big rich investors buy all the stocks and have their say and make more money and life is hell!

330 2018-05-13 18:17:13 Once the evolved DNA understands that it's dealing with an inferiori "junk" species, it stops trying to change it or win it over, finds its own (new) species, and avoids it.  Since Aspies are more talented the smart ones just hide and make money trading stocks, betting, etc.

333 2018-05-13 18:14:25 And the fact you call anyone who supports gun control "anti-gun" shows how much you are willing to lie and distort to push your agenda. Aren't you rich enough already with your blood money from the manufacturers of AR-15s, bump stocks, and the like?

342 2018-05-13 18:08:22 Such a great result for the American public, that Big Pharma and Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief that their bottom lines won't be affected and drug stocks all increased in price. Public is being sold on a shell game instead of real help
343 2018-05-13 18:08:17 If China can live with destocking corn stocks & not import barley then @USDA is too high on Chinese barley imports & too low on world stocks

393 2018-05-13 17:08:17 Well, I think of that as the main trait that distinguishes a good investor from a bad one: if you don’t think that stock market investors have the wind on their backs and you are not able to stick to a long term strategy, you shouldn’t invest in stocks imo.

453 2018-05-13 16:18:12 Massive problem with this metropolitan London elite is they don’t believe there is an issue, they don’t see that 90% of our fish stocks are taken by French fisherman, they don’t see the poverty caused by Wai sting out money on EU pensions for unelected officials. So sad

455 2018-05-13 16:14:31 Good thing “AR” doesn’t mean “automatically rifle.” It’s also a good thing that automatic rifles have been illegal for years, and that bump stocks (which repeatedly move the body of the gun forward-and-backward, simulating automatic fire) were banned earlier this year.

527 2018-05-13 14:52:37 When you’re done playing with them. Use the money to buy stocks w a seasoned financial advisor. Expect occasional short-term losses; rely on the twin pillars of long term-thinking and compound interest to do right by you. Keep playing Magic through comfortable retirement. Win.

565 2018-05-13 14:16:51 They have convinced their employees that gun regulations triggered the current bankruptcy. That is far from true. Taking profits and loans, and putting it back into stocks, has caused debt. And the market is saturated due to NRA hype during Obama's presidency.

613 2018-05-13 13:20:58 I agree partially, but the circulation supply is not compellingly decisive for price. Many factors around here, don't forget the psychological one which is a huge factor on every exchange (stocks or cyptos). Additionally, some projects need a high supply for their goals.
614 2018-05-13 13:20:14 The Reason I don't prefer discussing my stocks publicly is simple. I don't want  anyone following to get affected by my mistakes.

661 2018-05-13 12:07:05 I am surprised that Titan went down after showing good results.... Whereas banks stocks go up despite bad performance. I only hope Titan is more a pullback,.. It is at a crucial support now, and should bounce up?
662 2018-05-13 12:03:54 The lucrative export of key Soviet raw materials over the course of the Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–41) enabled Germany to maintain its stocks of rubber and grain from the start of the invasion of Soviet held territory in June, until October 1941.
663 2018-05-13 12:03:27 STOCKS TO WATCH: Good technical set up is observed in stocks like Vedanta, YES Bank, Hindustan Zinc, CG Power, Nalco, Petronet, Larsen & Toubro, Petronet LNG, Capital First and Bharat Financial.
664 2018-05-13 12:01:31 The index derivatives will follow the MCX pattern only. Not many will take aggressive positions and will wait for US markets to open and then trade. Bank Nifty weekly expiry will ensure that action shifts post 7 pm Non index cash stocks anyway have low FII participation.
665 2018-05-13 12:00:59 Oui. Par exemple certains comme Steve Keen, en observant l'évolution de certains paramètres (des flux et des stocks de dette..), ont pu prédire les subprimes.
Et encore dans ce tableau on ne parle pas de certaines sciences encore différentes. Type la linguistique.

667 2018-05-13 11:59:08 Check the gas prices.  The working middle class worries about the basics and not stocks and bonds.  I would suggest that the majority of people don't start their day reading the Wall Street Journal during breakfast.
668 2018-05-13 11:53:11 Certain broad macro trends help an investor in identifying the next big theme. For instance, a confluence of 6th Pay commission, farm loan waivers & implementation of MNREGA initiated big bull in consumer stocks from 2009.

698 2018-05-13 11:17:37 It's the @genesis_vision $gvt platform. It's a trust management platform on blockchain meaning you invest your gvt with professional traders and they day trade stocks, crypto and forex on your behalf. All trades are public and traders must invest their own $ alongside yours.

721 2018-05-13 10:43:03 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
722 2018-05-13 10:41:52 What is a healthy market for me?
- There are leading #stocks breaking out to new highs.
- The weekly chart of $QQQ, $SPY, $DIA, $IWM looks good and they are above the 50 weekly MA.
- There is no breakdown or down trend below the 50 MA in the weekly chart of the indices.
723 2018-05-13 10:40:03 not to mention forex and stocks gains are non-taxed, is that funny? LMAO

725 2018-05-13 10:39:57 It's always difficult for me to find the right balance between cash and invested capital. But as long as the #market is healthy and #stocks breaking out to new highs, there is no reason why not to put some capital at work. But I always do it slowly.
726 2018-05-13 10:37:54 The #markets closed strong this week. They bounced back from their support levels. Strongest market: Small caps ($IWM) and tech #stocks ($QQQ). The volume was low. We will see next week is this was just a "one week wonder" ;)
727 2018-05-13 10:37:24 MCX is far more linked to Global commodities. I doubt a similar pattern in Stocks. Also, the primary market hours haven't lost relevance for most Stock Markets around the World after Extension. Only thing is relatively lower volumes in Extended Hours.

There might be muted QOQ growth for the next couple quarters but that doesn’t change what’s good about the company..

776 2018-05-13 09:07:44 It’s fascinating over time when you see the stocks they pick change from crazy high flying ones to those with figures and potential.  They’re also with the trends, boohoo for instance which I failed to listen too unfortunately and sold in the twenties

781 2018-05-13 08:55:36 I've been mulling this over. I don't think Bitcoin miners and gold miners are comparable. A gold standard doesn't depend on mining for its existence, because historical gold stocks are large. But Bitcoin will always depend on mining, even after the 21m bitcoins limit is reached.

783 2018-05-13 08:51:52 would you consider Sony Stocks as "invested in VR" just because they have PS VR?
784 2018-05-13 08:49:34 Wait market capitalization is if everyone bought all the stocks available at the current price. Which they didn’t and in that case the price would move up anyway, along with market cap hence it’s  Not the value of the company. Correct me if I’m wrong.
785 2018-05-13 08:47:09 They held 9% stake in PCJ. Hence they had to do the restructuring. Even we do not own 10% of any one stock right? It is like all eggs in one basket.

786 2018-05-13 08:44:43 Brexit is like a large major supermarket saying that it no longer wants to trade with major farmers and suppliers, and their customers will have a *much* better deal if they buy their stocks from allotment holders, the W.I. and people who operate on a small scale
787 2018-05-13 08:44:26 thanks for the info Jana. If that's the case, they should have sold other stocks as well. It's bit intriguing. 

I also believe the company should do well. trying to get info as much as possible about this fall.
788 2018-05-13 08:39:14 Wholeheartedly agree. I've had many of them. Have to say it's probably my desert island beer.

Thanks so much for the explanation of the process. 

Just worried now the stocks are getting low!

791 2018-05-13 08:23:44 Sir, on a tangential query, would it be possible to make money by buying stocks before the stock dividend date and selling a week or two post dividend. Will it work in a bull market or is everything so priced in that this won't work?

Not referring to subsistence/indigenous hunting/fishing here-this is about the trophy/recreational slaughter of wildlife. It is a genetic disservice
808 2018-05-13 08:02:11 Yes. Basically use the depth for all stocks, the bigger ones ($10) for me need more Chart watching but even then its more Depth. But even still got those it's just a reference, 99% based off reading order flow.

913 2018-05-13 05:05:37 Good question. He isn't far off, but only because I feel our ruck stocks are pretty low quality at the moment. Big day for Zac.
914 2018-05-13 05:03:50 Keep it upto 6% of your pf.   We have seen in  stocks how situations change drastically and ignored stocks become star performers.  God willing we will see the same here.   They have a great product and now business is back on rails.  Markets needs to see real nos now.

916 2018-05-13 04:59:01 Massive Phama buy back of stocks.
They plan to do this and then triple the prices.
My plan is put the C.E.O.s in Gitmo as an example. Then seize the stocks they bought back. Then pass those stocks out to victims.

925 2018-05-13 04:44:46 It basically just finds stocks up a certain percentage, marks a few price values based on my criteria, and then shorts the stocks with risk reward based on those price values. I haven’t incorporated any kind of pattern recognition or real technical indicators yet.
926 2018-05-13 04:43:22 A lot of Thunder Stocks got wrecked tonight cause people were not patient enough at the beginning or in the middle or the end of the race. It just wasn’t necessary. I hope it got out of there system tonight. So we can get back to racing.

PROOF: Real estate stocks pay dividends from 4-10%. And real estate investments even more. So if @realDonaldTrump was worth $4 bn, his INCOME would be 160-400 million PER YEAR.
942 2018-05-13 04:08:16 In country where most ppl love to buy without bills (aviod tax), pay n receive unaccounted cash (bribe), invest in Ponzy schemes to earn big knowing they r fraudsters n lose millions trading in penny stocks, Modi courageously banned notes a big risk no politician will ever take.

For othrs educational purpose, more on #stocks deathcross
It is named a death cross due to the X shape it makes when the trend is charted and is often considered a sign of further losses for a particular stock.
944 2018-05-13 04:05:48 one thing about Trump, he cannot handle America problems for example: gas is sky high, healthcare is sky high, stocks are down at it lowest, racist is at its highest. mass shooting at it highest .no cost of living pay raise. the only thing he accomplished the release of 3 people

963 2018-05-13 03:34:25 I was up four stocks to two in game ten against Rocky but I didn't have the tenacity/grit/composure to bring my A game when I needed to close it out. Really happy at the mental level we dueled today
964 2018-05-13 03:31:40 I charge at least five big ones for nothing.
Nothing is actually incredibly valuable in industry.

HDFC at all time high and other private banks following the suit.

966 2018-05-13 03:30:03 It seems that by doing that we lose the war for hearts and minds. We come off as a nation who can't stand by the agreements it makes with other nations trying to build a greater peace together. The limited solutions that result definitely help those investing in "defense" stocks!
967 2018-05-13 03:29:31 He is saying he dont know anything about it thats why he will not invest. But he is saying it will come to a bad end witout knowing it. How come such person who is not ready to take risk on something new became so rich because of stocks 
968 2018-05-13 03:29:18 It's going to be strange for our future history books to have a comedy section for laughing stocks like you! Your children will be embarrassed that they even know you. You still have time to do the right thing though.
969 2018-05-13 03:23:40 All financial markets are driven by human speculative behavior which is reflected in the charts. TA is used to try & interpret the charts & doesn't matter whether its #Crypto, #commodities, #stocks, #indices, etc. The same TA can be applied to all.

971 2018-05-13 03:15:33 It's new for many & we have seen #NSS mess with some really good stocks. Lately we have seen $FUSZ and $AXXA hit hard. There were no shares to even be borrowed on $AXXA. Regardless of origional publish date, there's obviously a reason it was posted by ABCNEWS.

992 2018-05-13 02:38:33 The NRA also opposes a ban on bump stocks like the one used by the Las Vegas mass murderer. That’s another. There are tons of other examples. Their advocacy makes America less safe, and we need to be less scared of calling them out, and doing it strongly.
993 2018-05-13 02:38:06 We have to be raising the value of washi tape stock.  I claim Personal responsibility if sharpie stocks rise.  It’s all me.
994 2018-05-13 02:37:09 Not only that, but guaranteed ppl were trading stocks based on it. That dump of stock by Icahn just before steel tariffs were announced is only the tip of the iceberg.

999 2018-05-13 02:29:42 Not likely.  This current model can't be sustained.  And many they can't sell the data anymore because the statistics have been altered by their new ToS. Stocks dropping as customer satisfaction is in a free fall.

1012 2018-05-13 02:15:35 Yes. Everything has fallen to crap. Unemployment is at an all time low. Stocks are through the roof. Evil Empires are cowering. Oh, wait, I forgot why I was complaining...

1015 2018-05-13 02:11:28 Hmmm takes time to gain in value. Most stocks return 6% per year. A .01 move on TBP is 1.5% return. So .04 per year gain would be 6%....  annnd it just depends what people are willing to pay for it

1044 2018-05-13 01:09:37 I don't think anyone's hating on penny stocks....it's a matter of where new traders are best suited to begin trading, and low float penny stocks that can wipe u out is not where to begin the journey....U need exp first, and pats room is where to learn
1045 2018-05-13 01:07:37 The rich have always had money and it has never helped middle or lower class people. They spend on stocks, or toys. And neither "trickle down". They COULD help is via taxes, to help pay for food stamps, and childcare, and other things that the Rs are taking away even as I type.
1046 2018-05-13 01:06:48 This is just bull. Big pharmacy' s stocks went up because they realized Trump isn't going to do anything.

1051 2018-05-13 01:02:24 Also, this is just my assumption, but I think Stocks is the type that likes testing a lot of things out in preseason and has a set (not yet revealed) lineup in her head for the actual season.
1052 2018-05-13 01:01:51 Maro, esos análisis que hacen de criptos no son muy fiables en el sentido que no hay fundamento para hacerlo a comparación de stocks o demás. La verdad, las cripto son muy volátiles y el factor suerte si es muy relevante. Te lo digo por qué estoy estudiando en la bolsa, saludos.

1063 2018-05-13 00:43:16 It’s about the P&L’s. Making money for the share holders. Thing is today more people own stocks than before. Through investment funds, 401k’s etc. and those are a driving force at decisions being made

Most 401Ks are diversified limiting focused gains
1167 2018-05-12 22:37:17 This man tryna talk me into stocks too
1168 2018-05-12 22:35:24 But I can check my stocks on my Apple Watch, can’t check it on a fancy Swiss watch but both would be cool!

1180 2018-05-12 22:15:49 Your portfolio might be doing great but if you had the least bit of intellectual integrity you would know that a portfolio is comprised of far more than stocks. My portfolio is great too. So again, the stock market erased it gains. Thanks for trying to pivot away from a fact.!
1181 2018-05-12 22:15:39 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your cancer
1182 2018-05-12 22:14:09 #bbcnewsents seems like not singing again probably wasn’t the best idea in hindsight. I think even I would have sang again and probably scored more points. The UK failing once again. Laughing stocks
1183 2018-05-12 22:11:58 I’ve always had this vision that we should bring back the stocks... for the utter c@&£s in society... like this chap... they’d be in the middle of roundabouts and every toot of the horn unleashes a tomato in the face or balls!? Whose with me??

1192 2018-05-12 22:03:03 I started following a self-made millionaire who was one by the age of 21, trading thousands of Penny Stocks. It is something I have spent time learning and enjoying. A community as formed around studying penny stocks. Not for everyone though.
1193 2018-05-12 22:02:30 Now's the time for oil/ gas stocks getting ready for summer...buying calls..stay close to strike. 60 days out...
1194 2018-05-12 22:02:00 Vous me faites marrer avec vos chouineries sur les stocks-options. Il ne s'agit ni plus ni moins que d'aligner les intérêts du management avec celui des actionnaires, ce qui est la plupart du temps très efficace. Pour les parachutes dorés, parfaitement d'accord avec vous.

1196 2018-05-12 22:00:03 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
1197 2018-05-12 21:59:44 Check your stocks, the market has erased all of its gains since the beginning of the year oh and your gas prices are going up.  That’s a factual statement, call your stock broker.
1198 2018-05-12 21:59:22 Why would I need a financial advisor. I’m pretty much a damn genius already. “Pretty much” is a lightly used term here. @kanyewest gives me all the financial advice I need. I just follow his tweets and wisdom on what stocks/crypto to buy.
1199 2018-05-12 21:59:11 You promised Medicare would negotiate prices and you’d allow Americans to buy drugs from Canada. Your plan does neither.  In yet another betrayal to your base this plan will do next to nothing to contain prices. Proof: drug company stocks rallied on the news!
1200 2018-05-12 21:57:23 Of course and they pay out the contract even though he produced no results because if they didn't then the President just trashed them on Twitter and their stocks tank.
1201 2018-05-12 21:56:31 Watch the drug companies stocks, they are all going up because they like your no-plan, drug plan. Your plan does NOTHING to lower prices. What an idiot! Whoever came up with this plan, should be fired. Ridiculous! Another campaign promise broken!
1202 2018-05-12 21:56:14 It’s a bad idea to look at p/e for tech stocks bc their earnings are so much into the future. The ratio is meaningless at extremes bc low earnings explodes it as the divisor and neg earnings flip the signs.

1209 2018-05-12 21:46:06 What a word of wisdom from #Buffett!!! Thanks for sharing Coach! Many worried about the next recession. These short paragraphs will be the best answer for that. Also in your awesome #DGI class, we bought stocks only when they fell which matched exactly what Buffett said here. 
1210 2018-05-12 21:45:40 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your ADHD

1. #BigPharma stocks soar as tRUmp won’t let #Medicare negotiate drug prices
2. #BigOil & Putin make a bundle as your gas prices climb
3. Health Ins Co’s jack your premiums & force coverage limits
4. Food prices climb w/out enuff workers

1217 2018-05-12 21:39:28 "Points indicate whole dollar price changes. If  someone states that IBM is up 5 points, it means the IBM share price is  $5 higher. With stocks, a point is a dollar on a $20 stock, and a point  is a dollar on a $500 stock." literally from the article
1218 2018-05-12 21:38:18 in a fraction of a second. And can carry multiple magazines. 
I can get on board with bump stocks.
I can get on board with age limits but it needs to be universal (guns, voting, military service, etc...)
1219 2018-05-12 21:38:16 Shit, I too should dig up all those quotes about stocks and replace the word with crypto.
1220 2018-05-12 21:36:59 Naturally you’ve gotta talk about time of day, key price levels and how the stock reacts around it, when multiple stocks are running with each other which one is the strongest & which is the weakest, if a stock makes new lows/highs continuously and “should” reverse but can’t
1221 2018-05-12 21:36:10 Still large stocks of the really popular #Eurovision  t-shirt "Keep Calm And Vote UK" Order yours now.
1222 2018-05-12 21:33:17 You will end up with mutiple goals/opinions w a broad movement. My understanding is they want to raise the age for rifles (guns?) to 21,such as Florida has done and supported by Kyle, ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks and semi-automatic mach guns and allow rsrch by the CDC

1225 2018-05-12 21:30:31 My new bank (not ING) was cool enough to wait 18 months for the official paper stating I was officially an EX US citizen. I did everything legally and by the book. IRS + Fincen etc. Stocks given to me after I relinquished my USC. I NEVER got any news from IRS after sending doc’s
1226 2018-05-12 21:29:02 This whole hate mongering on stocks under $10.00 per share is getting a bit rediculous. There is good money to be made when you learn a VALID trading and risk system. Avoid P/D low floats and alert chasing, but saying to avoid trading anything besides largecaps is just ignorant

1235 2018-05-12 21:19:16 Anyways I'm not interested in stocks nowadays 
1236 2018-05-12 21:18:40 Lots of TSX stocks with 5% yields and higher. All sustainable.
1237 2018-05-12 21:16:26 In the good old days they could have been tarred & feathered, bucked, put in the stocks, even an iron maiden would do. I imagine a cleansing by fire is appropriate. Hung from a sour apple tree or firing squad. Traitors were dealt with back then, first the trial.
1238 2018-05-12 21:15:26 There was SO MUCH BACOFOIL used. Hope they’ll have built up stocks again by Christmas.

1242 2018-05-12 21:11:29 This is related to the “Securities Act Of 1933” and not the FATCA. “US Person” not permitted to have securities in a foreign bank. ING forced me to sell all my stocks in 2006. I gave them to my NRA minor daughter but after the FATCA ING decided as I was the custodian she was..

1244 2018-05-12 21:09:02 Many are looking at 1Q18 EPS surprises & not understanding why stocks are not reacting to them. Instead, look at 2Q18 est chg for the answer
1245 2018-05-12 21:08:28 Another of your big lies!  Big pharma must agree with me!  Stocks went up yesterday!  Just how dumb do you think we are?  Unlike you, we can read!
1246 2018-05-12 21:08:23 How can the president not be bought?  He was going to ban bump stocks and other regulations for assault weapons and said he wasn't afraid of the NRA.  Then he comes to Dallas and says the exact opposite.  I'm pretty sure he was bought.
1247 2018-05-12 21:05:06 @ValueTrapBlog I would to know if you tried Simply Wall St and what you think of it? It seems to be a real good stock screener with plenty of data. I found great underevaluated stocks thanks to this service.
1248 2018-05-12 21:04:35 Dangit i only took 19 stocks in crews (needed 20 to win with my 4 lol)
1249 2018-05-12 21:02:47 OMFG ... I know people have different opinions on stocks ... but let’s remember THIS video every time we are tempted to think someone on the other side of an opinion is stupid. Holy shit!
1250 2018-05-12 21:02:46 Those who invest in health care stocks went upon a buying spree after Trump announced his plan to reduce drug prices. Anyone have an idea why this occurred? Is he more interested in helping drug companies than those who need the drugs and who can't afford them? No, not him!
1251 2018-05-12 21:02:46 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump : I urge you to rein in the ATF’s regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners!
Thank you for taking action!
1252 2018-05-12 21:02:21 I’ve been home for 15 minutes and my dad is already trying to explain stocks to me
1253 2018-05-12 20:59:08 You do a great job. I try to look on and do DD on the stocks you mention to see what you are seeing
1254 2018-05-12 20:58:21 The fellow in Kisumu Kenya who is the only one meant to have the stocks has a phone number that does NOT work!! Your link meant to show me the bouquet is so weird that even a clear run down of the channels... Just channels is hard to figure... The cost is not given in your links
1255 2018-05-12 20:55:48 I've been trading part time for about 2 years. Just recently have I started really trying to dig into it and take it to the next level. Being more confident in my picks and when to get in and out of stocks
1256 2018-05-12 20:54:46 thinking about earning one million dollars...and it’s all thanks to the “stocks market”
1257 2018-05-12 20:54:18 So learning about investments and stocks is such a hassle, but guaranteed I will. I want to make a change with my man with our financial lifestyle 
1258 2018-05-12 20:53:26 This is where Sean Darcy's injury really hurts. SYD match would've been perfect to have managed Sandi and SYD's ruck stocks aren't great. On a brighter note, in retrospect, it was wise to have held back Stephen Hill and Ross says he, Wilson and Sonny are possibles next week.
1259 2018-05-12 20:50:25 LOL - a 1.5% allocation is "all in" when SPY has almost 10% to those three stocks. Nice catch.
1260 2018-05-12 20:43:43 We own guns and support all these points. We also support red flag laws, strict penalties for gun owners if their firearm is taken from their home because they were not safely secured, closing the gun show loophole and outlawing bump stocks.
1261 2018-05-12 20:43:31 We need shoulder stocks for dicks, obviously
1262 2018-05-12 20:43:25 We're not trading stocks here pal :)
1263 2018-05-12 20:42:19 Interesting, how some high-dividend yield stocks are in a major downtrend. NMDC is a recent once which caught my eye after PFC, REC.
God Bless NMDC, never be in an uptrend cycle ever since listed is positioned as if it can collapse any given day now. while logs record output.
1264 2018-05-12 20:41:57 Not arguing but debating!  I'll have a look at the book.  I could be pre-judging it but a lot of the financial media and books are alarmist.  Against this backdrop it is no surprise that joe public avoids stocks.  I could name an alarmist financial UK publication I better not!
1265 2018-05-12 20:41:56 It couldn't really have been anywhere else!  If you have time available, I can highly recomnend a trip to Sark. The food at Stocks Hotel @SarkHotel is excellent.

1268 2018-05-12 20:35:44 Suppressors require Class III license. You can't just go buy one and walk out with it. Bump stocks are stupid and just a fancy way to waste ammo. Magazine size doesn't matter all that much either.

1272 2018-05-12 20:30:37 I disagree. The bond market will implode in America as debt has never been higher and QE failed. The stock market is in a huge bubble too created by low rates. So as the bond market collapse, stocks and RE go down too.
1273 2018-05-12 20:29:20 Your Stocks go fall, stabilize the rise again!
1274 2018-05-12 20:27:16 Can you explain why big pharma stocks went up after the White House plan was rolled out?  Biotech up 3% as a sector - clearly your plan doesn’t look like it will cut into their profits.  For once patients over profits please!!!!
1275 2018-05-12 20:26:50 yeah, they're fun, DNR stocks them in a few locations down here.
1276 2018-05-12 20:26:16 Hey @Arbys I think if the @tigers hit 3 home runs I should get more than a small curly fry. Stocks, a suite, or free jamocha shakes for life would be nice.
1277 2018-05-12 20:26:08 Dave, I am very interested. By the way congrats on the 1/1 Trout!! I also firmly believe cards are like stocks!!! Please , when you have a moment let me know about your opportunity. Thank you.
1278 2018-05-12 20:26:02 Chairman you dey make my stocks fall oo
1279 2018-05-12 20:24:44 his net worth today is estimated between 1.65 mill & 1.8
it was not gradual growth, it happened in 1 single year
but he has not released tax returns since 2015
& the increase is unexplained based off his stocks
they did not double in value in 2014
1280 2018-05-12 20:23:01 If I felt more pithy I could soliloquize a bit about how garden decoration society has clearly played a role in the conduct of this gnome and how gnome rifle bump stocks should be banned but that's like a scent of blood to the Trumpster sharks.

 THANK YOU 
1284 2018-05-12 20:21:46 there's a graph in what you are applying to, you do not need to guess, or even research, just look at what you are replying to

in 2008 average house net worth went from 720k to 700k
his went from just over 1 mill to half a mill, cuz he had a lot in stocks
then recovered w/market
1285 2018-05-12 20:20:49 Investment suggestion. Buy Pharma stocks. The rich get richer.
1286 2018-05-12 20:20:44 That's why I love my oil stocks, plus pay dividends around 4%. Eventually the world will run out of oil, don't you think? As it runs short, the price rises. But stocks may fall if reserves go down. Contradictory tendencies.

1288 2018-05-12 20:14:33 Why did pharma stocks rise right after the new plan to reduce #drugpricing was announced?
1289 2018-05-12 20:14:30 I can handle calling the barbershop on my own, but what I’d like to know is when Google Assistant will be able to pick winning stocks. For now, machines can’t predict where markets are headed with great accuracy. Then again, neither can humans, but we keep trying.
1290 2018-05-12 20:12:05 Steven - any chance you’ll do a reverse split or issue another class of stocks that will trade above 1$?
1291 2018-05-12 20:07:54 "buying companies" = "investing in stocks"
1292 2018-05-12 20:04:48 This is an important point- it'd be like completely berating a Walmart cashier to tears and almost making them quit because the Wahl corp. stocks a product made by a specific other company the shopper doesn't like.

-Focus on daily resistance bo
-focus on low float rotation stocks
-focus on high momo stocks with a scanner

1306 2018-05-12 19:50:32 This era is the best time to start investing esp if your young. Theres so many tools out there like apps that make it so easy to do it.

1312 2018-05-12 19:46:45 So you are starting out and ready to invest into stocks. Congrats. Here are DOs and DONTs. DO.. regular LT diversified investing with low expenses... DONTs: Trading, big bets, hot tips, timing trampolines, Option gymnastics, risk pretzel math sculpting..these tend to drag returns
1313 2018-05-12 19:46:10 The point is that whilst in the long term stocks generate a positive return, there are periods in which this simply isn't the case. Not everyone has a 30 year time horizon.

1315 2018-05-12 19:43:20 Trump wants WAR. The entire GOP do... they know just what stocks to trade to PROFIT off of death and destruction. That's what they are really good at... Profiting off of the misery of others... As usual.
1316 2018-05-12 19:42:02 You nailed it on the dot.  Unfortunately, I'd make the adjustments when there are stocks that are obviously low liquidity and then you get a more "deceptive" stock like $BLNK that seemingly has liquidity but then they'd randomly pull all the bids/asks to cause the air pockets
1317 2018-05-12 19:36:48 You blurted a whole bunch of nothing Friday that drove up Big Pharma's stocks and offered no detail on how prescription drug prices would lower for low-income elderly Americans. WHOM are you helping?

1327 2018-05-12 19:28:56 More like million stocks
1328 2018-05-12 19:25:19 That's a fair statement as well as generally speaking the only cards one can make a massive ROI on are risky investments, as one needs to buy low when players are in the early years and hope they turn into superstars ... stocks are "safer" for sure.
1329 2018-05-12 19:23:45 That point of yours is 100% accurate and I wouldn't argue with you ... unless you're taling about stocks vs. cards of "established Hall of Fame type stars" ... there's basically zero risk in investing in LeBron, Brady, Kobe, Gretzky, Jordan, etc. Young players are risky though.
1330 2018-05-12 19:21:51 There's nothing fun about stocks and bonds, they're boring ... but with sportscards, the ROI is directly tied to the players actual on-field performance, which one can watch in real time ...

1333 2018-05-12 19:19:36 . Airline stocks are in the dumps and WestJet is struggling the most.  Shares of the Calgary-based low-cost airline have fallen 11-per-cent this week amid disappointing first-quarter results and a simmering labour dispute . @globeandmail
1334 2018-05-12 19:19:00 The demand for a single sports card is vastly different from a single class A preferred share of a world class company.  Maybe 100 people in the world want that card, but millions would buy the stock.  Plus, i get paid dividends with most stocks...
1335 2018-05-12 19:18:58 I didn't say investing in cards was "better", I said it was "more fun". However, it's extremely easy to sell cards on eBay and the commission rates can be lower than when selling stocks. Check out the recent Shohei Ohtani sales ... no hassle, quick auctions with massive prices.

1337 2018-05-12 19:15:25 Good stocks:

1. Exhibit consistent revenue, earnings and dividend growth over the past 5 years
2. Have an enduring product/service
3. Have scope and indication of management intention to continually expand
4. Are on a long-term uptrend

Right entry is on dips

1352 2018-05-12 19:01:23 I'm exposed to TGOD via ACB, which works for me. I am fairly firm on not buying MJ stocks that have say $2 mill in revenue and 150 mill shares outstanding. I also look at the cash on deposit and their cash burn - how long will the cash last them before earnings kick in.
1353 2018-05-12 19:00:57 Is these stocks good to buy ??

Backed by gold meant nothing because all stocks/assets/etc are valued in the currency being inflated, not in gold.

1392 2018-05-12 18:27:46 Then why have drug stocks gone up after your presentation? Just more bs like Obama used to do? Why Medicare cannot negociante drug prices? Why a procedure in hospital is 15 times more expensive than on a private outpatient setting?

1423 2018-05-12 18:02:05 @amazon If your CEO is one of the world's wealthiest people, and your stocks are up, and you've been given tax breaks by the US gov't...Why in the world are you raising prices? Trickle-up-economics? #dwindlingmiddleclass
1424 2018-05-12 18:00:54 Still waiting for your share of @DrNealDunnFL2’s #TaxBreak? Hate to break it to you, but you will be waiting a while.

$800 billion is going for #StockBuybacks. Not jobs, not productivity, not new wealth -- just money that rewards the 10% of Americans who own 84% of all stocks.

1429 2018-05-12 17:56:35 Not under your plan. If the pharmaceutical companies truly thought that your plan would cost them money, their stocks would not have risen. You're a liar and the biggest mistake the American public has ever made, by electing you as president.

1433 2018-05-12 17:49:37 I chose to invest in beer in the 90’s as a student. Luckily the refund bottles were more valuable in 2001 than most of the dot-com-bubble stocks.
1434 2018-05-12 17:48:34 One of those stocks that shouldn't have gone anywhere for the last 10 years if we didn't have monetary central planning. But whoever was buying at the bottom in 08 got rewarded for all the wrong reasons.

1441 2018-05-12 17:36:56 Tax cuts for corporations help the economy in many more ways than you think. More industries will be encouraged to open up new plants which would lead to more jobs. It's already happening. Bonuses to workers - already happening. Re-investment in stocks- already happening.
1442 2018-05-12 17:36:22 YA readers in the UK, an FYI:

1444 2018-05-12 17:32:01 @MATT_AND_NAT hi guys. You do need to update your website with details of stockists. I’m in London and went on a wild goose chase to Oxford Circus, to find out the shop you say stocks you has never heard of you... Bx

1448 2018-05-12 17:28:14 I've always been uncomfortable with the idea that shares / funds in a stocks and shares ISA have to be held in a nominee account.

1475 2018-05-12 16:54:18 That is what you have to say about the topic?
Trigger cranks and bump stocks mimic full auto without actually fully converting to full auto. It's a loophole, and needs to end.

1487 2018-05-12 16:42:45 The powers to be are mistaken if they think that by making it difficult for the new generation to trade in cryptos, they will stop trading or go for stock trading.

1503 2018-05-12 16:26:44 When Bill O'Neil was my mentor, he used to discuss the market and stocks with me directly while looking at a live chart. This is how he taught me - he didn't use written reports with charts - that's why I'm moving more to a video-based approach in order to better emulate that.

1507 2018-05-12 16:25:14 There are more jobs than skilled workers. Economy is so great it is out pacing qualified workers. Companies offering big incentives to fill position. Many companies profit so much they are buying back stocks. Things are Great! Then we have the Dem downers.

1513 2018-05-12 16:21:38 There should be. It seems that Dotard goes on twitter or to his rallies and denigrates a company who needs government help like ATT with the merger, stocks plummet, Cohen moves in with the offer.

Isn't it disgusting. It can't last, they're really turning on each other now.
1514 2018-05-12 16:21:38 Ben Graham explains quite clearly the dangers of tech, as it should be an auxiliary item acquired with a little extra care than the normal, dependable stocks.  It’s an important sector for sure, but one you must tread in with caution.
1515 2018-05-12 16:21:12 This so called Tax Cut is really starting to smell and people are waking up to it realizing they've been robbed. Studies are now showing that most of the large companies bought back stocks instead  of reinvesting in their companies. Did we not learn from history.

1518 2018-05-12 16:13:22 While Trump his latest prescription drug plans are great for consumers, all you need to know is that drug stocks rose afterwards.   Bigly.
1519 2018-05-12 16:11:33 Companies sell small pieces of the company, stocks, in order to raise money. People then trade them as they gain or lose value. The "market cap" is the cost of all pieces combined if they were sold at whatever an owner of one of these pieces sold one for last.

1527 2018-05-12 16:03:05 Regular retail investors and other older folks barley know how to work a regular broker account in stocks. No way they can figure out a DEX, nobody is going to use them. Centralized exchanges is what’s needed to link the crypto world and “regular” world. Simple as that .
1528 2018-05-12 16:02:31 World War 3 THREAT: Iran plans to OVERWHELM and DESTROY Israel, former general warns. It always has, the very reason they wanted the agreement. That enabled them to purchase and build vast weapon stocks to attempt just that. Pres. Trump has put a stop to that.
1529 2018-05-12 16:01:44 The main thing to remember is you’re always on your own. You vs them, if you want more flow to trickle down to you climb to the top.
1530 2018-05-12 16:01:06 I’m sure you’re aware many investors publicly voice an opinion about the stocks they are in. Icahn being a great example - it means you believe in the asset you just want it to turn around and achieve its full potential.

1563 2018-05-12 15:32:28 Are these notes with some downside cap and upside cap? Or just expensive baskets of stocks used by Fisher who then adds more expensive advisory fees?

1568 2018-05-12 15:29:00 Stocks of companies filing for bankruptcy become Pink Sheets. Typically the transaction cost (brokerage fee) for these instruments is high and transparency is limited. Perhaps a tokenized version of pink sheets will have more transparency and lower exchange cost.

1575 2018-05-12 15:22:21 We need to obviously stop bump stocks and fully automatic weapons.  If you're so badass defend yourself with a handgun.  Like the hero always does in action movie.
1576 2018-05-12 15:22:15 Immediately after this "announcement" drug stocks rose sharply.  Guess they're worried.
1577 2018-05-12 15:20:19 Which surely explains the skyrocketing Drug Company stocks on the news.

1632 2018-05-12 14:20:03 Pharmaceutical stocks didn't crash or dip because after all the big talk and hype there was nothing at all in it that would allow for the Government or anyone else to bargain with their companies for better prices for Rx drugs he's claiming victory for a war he never fought AGAIN

1642 2018-05-12 14:16:05 The other day somebody was bemoaning the sheer scale of his wealth and I actually caught myself saying “Well, much of it is held in stocks, bonds, and other non-liquid assets,” but then my brain kicked in and I remembered poor people deserve more protections than inanimate paper.

1651 2018-05-12 14:12:42 From what I've read, the best investors pick winning stocks about 60-70% of the time in bull markets, less in bear markets. Just because you may be investing in "quality stocks" is no guarantee. Can you guarantee Unilever won't go down over the long-term? 
1652 2018-05-12 14:12:21 Pharmaceutical stocks went up. That’s a big indication that it’s going to help corporations not us.

1662 2018-05-12 14:05:30 Asset allocation.  70% stocks 20 bonds 5 gold and silver and 5 in crypto.  Rebalance twice per year.   Beware chasing returns but some mutual funds are outliers.  I like flpsx, vanguard 500,  fidelity contra.  Reits and emerging markets 5% ish each but use Morningstar to select.
1663 2018-05-12 14:05:28 None. Where the investments?( stocks, bonds, any other properties owned etc), money in the bank means nothing cause that only helps the banks. The other guy probably gonna have all his stuff repossessed, So I say none. One just saved better or care less about flashy stuff.

1667 2018-05-12 14:03:19 REITs are total return stocks. They create wealth through the distribution of FCF  and through RE-investing FCF.

1672 2018-05-12 13:58:17 Yeah I ain’t making that cut anytime soon. Lol especially since I started investing in stocks. Not becoming super wealthy overnight is a far fetched dream.

1675 2018-05-12 13:57:51 Pour les stocks de bouffe en tout cas.
1676 2018-05-12 13:57:22 Oh then ur made of stronger stuff than me!! My tolerance stocks for dumb or intransigent people are all but depleted! I'm not proud!!
1677 2018-05-12 13:57:13 Congratulations to Billie and Aaran who have tied the knot today at Bristol Harbour Hotel here’s Billie’s bouquet filled with roses, stocks, larkspur, veronica and clematis. Mixed buttonholes too for the Groom’s party. 
1678 2018-05-12 13:56:39 Practically nothing.

Healthcare stocks went down Friday and then they went back up because they know  Trump is all talk.

Don't listen to what Trump says watch what he does and the outcome.

No tariffs on aluminum or Steel.
Stocks only went up because of the tax reduction.
1679 2018-05-12 13:56:28 Bump stocks. Any questions?
1680 2018-05-12 13:56:00 More hype from the master of BS.
We have not seen anything about that speech which should concern investors” in the pharmaceutical industry.
Shares of several major drug and biotech companies rose immediately after the speech, as did the stocks of pharmacy benefit managers.
1681 2018-05-12 13:56:00 My portfolio had a total increase of 4 percent this week! Everything on the Up and Up. My new goal is to have 1000 dollars in there by July! And allocate the money throughout a broad range of stocks. (Index , etf, dividend, etc.)

1687 2018-05-12 13:53:57 Stay by potus. BRILLIANT work so far.   Put stocks on the market at $.45cents and I am sure by singapore date it will all over. The share will be trading at $10000000*45.   The establishment are wandering in the dark.  Keep it UP.
1688 2018-05-12 13:52:48 And the USA will sell them it's excess food stocks in return.
Food instead of bombs.
Not a bad result.

1693 2018-05-12 13:49:34 There isn't a better one,really. I don't even think the place I got it still stocks them, they do replace parts but that's all I got. There's no alternatives for me. I can't even have a life in my own home.
1694 2018-05-12 13:49:17 Father Called me - what is your stock market showing ? who is winning in Karnataka BJP or congress ? what factor In ?

Me - Nifty and Bank nifty show BJP is winning with majority and small cap / mid cap, portfolio stocks & INR is showing Congress winning with Majority.
1695 2018-05-12 13:49:17 And just to add to it all lest we forget, AFTER Trumps wonderful summit on Rx drugs, that was supposed to allow for bargaining to make them less expensive, major pharmaceutical companies saw their stocks soar...since they will be losing money and all  neat trick right
1696 2018-05-12 13:47:57 Oh. I wouldn't bet against stocks though. More unpredictable than just regular investing, and I'd rather see a stock succeed.

1700 2018-05-12 13:44:41 Hey, if what you’re pitching is such a great deal for Americans, why did drug stocks go up yesterday? Seriously, answer the question, smart guy. Why did biotech and big pharma appear to like what you’re proposing? Feel free to get back to me on here. ...

1704 2018-05-12 13:39:54 If that's true then why did the stocks go up on pharmaceutical companies after your little pledge.  THEY KNOW you are gong to do nothing to bring prices down.
1705 2018-05-12 13:37:44 Also,  have you guys looked at cloud stocks lately?  Hard to find any cap less than 5 billion usd -  makes crypto look like a value investment $btc $eth $strat

1712 2018-05-12 13:30:20 You’ve done nothing to improve situation! Pharma stocks up on your announcement, they know you are skirting the real issues of high drug $$!
1713 2018-05-12 13:29:42 Aren’t a lower level of Indian stocks already being priced in through trade flows?  If the stocks were there and they were the lowest CIF priced (as they are) wouldn’t they would be exporting 7mb at 85c? Unless this is a quality issue with the stocks.
1714 2018-05-12 13:28:59 Doing what, exactly? Since the start of President Obama’s first term in 2009, at least 45 of the top terrorist leaders have been killed or captured by U.S. forces. Obama had 11 hostages released from NK, 3 from Iran, saved the economy, record stocks, etc. Keep up, champ

1716 2018-05-12 13:28:02 Yes and it’s more of an indictment on today’s players not coming up and being able to hit the other way.....but hey they have great launch angle.
1717 2018-05-12 13:28:01 I find it amazing that after 10 years of low Interest Rates and the 'Hunt for Yield' and biggest Stockmarket Bull Run ever, there are still decent Stocks paying high and growing Dividends.
1718 2018-05-12 13:27:28 I'm placing my bet on Black Panther.
Someone slips and bam, stocks go through the floor.
1719 2018-05-12 13:26:57 Getting NK to the table is good. But it’s not yet settled. Unemployment is better. The turnaround didnt start with Trump. He’s the beneficiary. What’s the plan to improve the deficit?  None. How about improving crime and eliminating bump stocks. Said he would. Environment?

1721 2018-05-12 13:25:56 Wow... didn’t know any of this! Thanks. I know that in 2017 there was a serious IVIG shortage in uk, and stocks are chronically low, although I imagine both supply and demand factors are at work.
1722 2018-05-12 13:25:53 When trump announced his plan for lowering drug prices did anyone else see the pharmaceutical companies stocks rise??? Don’t get it twisted, it only benefits their pockets, not your health.
1723 2018-05-12 13:25:48 @smerconish why is Tom Perez not talking about the only people that are getting rich are the 1%. Companies are buying back stocks and upping dividends not raising salaries of workers.
1724 2018-05-12 13:25:18 Iceland is not desperate for Teslas just because a fanboy who owns stocks says it is. In march only 220 EVs were sold there, 100 of those cars were PHEV SUVs.
1725 2018-05-12 13:24:44 In the car now and I'm quite curious how the place looks like :0

Mom described it as the place where thriftshops get their stocks so hhh
1726 2018-05-12 13:24:05 I’m admittedly an optimist, but I don’t buy what the author is saying here. Seems like stocks bounced back after the market had overreacted to the pre-announcement hype. As a pharmacist I’m hopeful this plan has impact. Gottlieb’s idea about anti-kickback would be a game-changer.

1734 2018-05-12 13:15:03 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

I am short, intermediate and long term bullish U.S. Stocks once again, which has been my position for the past 2 years except for this recent move. I will avoid NASDAQ until new weekly high.
1741 2018-05-12 13:09:59 @hotdwagg this is for taking about stocks, not your personal politics platform
1742 2018-05-12 13:09:51 No doubt, stocks have gradually been going down, question that needs to be answered is why.  Is it Capelin stocks, smolt survival, bycatch problems? The rift being developed between Hook and Release and Retention fisherman is not productive and sadly it seems to be getting bigger
1743 2018-05-12 13:08:13 Just another ploy by Democrats and MSM to change the narrative away from the great things happening. Prisoners released, NK denuclearization,Jobs, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence, Stocks, Prescription Prices, Border Security, Tax Cuts, Human Trafficking, Military. #Winning

1746 2018-05-12 13:04:47 In a few years 8.7 billion market cap for real value coins will be nothing considering the growth of the entire crypto market.

1747 2018-05-12 13:04:08 It is not but Minnesota DFL candidates tend not to be associated with hedge funds. MPR also said she owns many financial stocks.
1748 2018-05-12 13:03:33 It was either 1 or 2 private groups and we all know who they may be.. Sykes and his crew is notorious for shorting & I would put my $ on them.

1753 2018-05-12 12:59:44 This does not go far enough. Pharma stocks went up right after which tells you how relieved they are
1754 2018-05-12 12:59:12 I wasn't talking about a trader I was talking about an investor.  I was also focusing in on an investor in quality stocks.  Plenty of those investors do have a long-term success rate of 70%/80% or higher.  If you buy Unilever can you really be wrong over the long-term?
1755 2018-05-12 12:58:10 But not let Medicare negotiate, I could hear the big pharma celebrating from here. The stocks went up and Humans are dying without reasonable access to prescriptions. Shameful. Sad. Bad.
1756 2018-05-12 12:57:56 "I don’t know how the market will perform this year. I don’t know how the market will perform next year. I don’t know if stocks will be higher or lower in 5 years. Indeed, even though the probabilities favor a positive outcome, I don’t know if stocks will be higher in 10 yrs"

1761 2018-05-12 12:52:03 You left out “and breaks another campaign promise which makes pharmacy stocks surge”
1762 2018-05-12 12:51:06 I second you for @sanstocktrader, really a gentlemen, helpful and down to earth,
1763 2018-05-12 12:50:57 Not true. Our daily lives are affected. What if stocks tank because of Trump’s volatility !  Our world environment is more at risk.  What about just decency?
1764 2018-05-12 12:49:29 Wouldn't bother gents. I just binned an MDT LSS of my Tikka, primarily because the groups opened up horrendously, but also heavier, and the tac style stocks with high(er) cap mags, pistol grips etc are just so uncomfortable to shoulder. OK for comps, no good for field.
1765 2018-05-12 12:48:23 @hm_custserv Kindly look at the stocks being offered online. Various Sizes are not available and they don't get updated too.

1780 2018-05-12 12:35:28 The Liberal, Communist agenda is leading people further and further away from God; far from wisdom and undersanding, and into the devil's stocks of bondage.

1792 2018-05-12 12:22:04 Stock Tip: If President Trump is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, recommend a "strong buy" for stocks in pharmaceutical companies that produce valium and other seizure medications to mitigate apoplectic reactions from the far left.
1793 2018-05-12 12:21:03 Amazing how Trump is getting tough on drug companies, releases his proposal of how he is going to do that and their stocks skyrocket.

Do you actually think it's because his proposal benefit us and not them?
1794 2018-05-12 12:20:54 well, to be totally accurate it would be rise in one genre of music since stocks only one asset class. But either way Nickelback does better job driving home point that ETFs just a vehicle.

1798 2018-05-12 12:18:32 Very True!! But it’s ok, either ways #smallcap and #midcap stocks were overvalued. 

Although the trend can get totally screwed in congress wins, because neither small cap/mid cap/nifty might know where to go :p

1808 2018-05-12 12:07:54 Do we really have to go into basic math here?  If the % of stocks you get right is say 80% then averaging losers can work.  If the % is say 60% or less then averaging losers may not work.  If you are a quality investor then the % you get right will be higher.

1817 2018-05-12 11:56:32 Hi @Nokiamobile
I was trying to buy the N6 2018, but according to @CPWTweets in store they only sell a single sim variant. They said the dual (hybrid) sim can be ordered online. However- not an option on their website. Is there anywhere else that stocks them in the UK?

Thanks

1843 2018-05-12 11:31:24 Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and recognizing taxpayer investments in the creation of new drugs will do more than these pithy actions combined. Drugs stocks soared yesterday as a result of these weak proposals.  Another Trump scam

1846 2018-05-12 11:29:22 The proof that your plan his weak and won’t help is the fact that pharmaceutical stocks rose to record levels shortly after your speech. You are just a com-man!

Price in an uptrend
1849 2018-05-12 11:28:57 So much for trump's promise to let Medicare directly negotiate drug prices.  In fact Big Pharma was so pleased w his speech, stocks of major drug companies rose as did those of pharmacy benefit managers, or the “middlemen” that trump said were getting “very, very rich.” @cspanwj

1856 2018-05-12 11:13:37 @StephenAtHome @cnnbrk we should check and see how much the pharmaceuticals paid Michael & Trump 2 negotiate so they can rape Medicare. Is this why their stocks have risen & Trump wants health insurance to benefit providers in fields not the people? Can’t help made deduction,no?

1872 2018-05-12 10:49:14 A scary development: Remember how @potus promised to bring drug prices down on the campaign trail?

2011 2018-05-12 06:49:04 Yep. That's literally all there is to it. Talk bad, stocks go down, decrease consumer confidence, increase confusion and introduce instability, then go to these companies and say that for a small fee, he will talk nice about them. Mob extortion on a corporate, natl scale.

2057 2018-05-12 05:33:58 No one believes this lie.  Drug companies stocks went up upon learning details.  More Trump B.S.

2059 2018-05-12 05:32:30 And there's really no plan.  No plan to have Medicare negotiate.  It will take years to implement.  Best of all, what is the plan to overturn current legislation that prevents negotiations with pharma to begin with? #TrumpLies and Big Pharma knows.  That's why stocks soared.

2061 2018-05-12 05:31:26 stocks rose for pharmacy companies because trump is not going to help America. a lot of bullshit talk and in the end nothing. more of the  republicans helping the 1%. let medicare deal directly with drug prices. why not?
2062 2018-05-12 05:29:08 It tells me that someone in Trump world recently bought some pharma stocks

Stocks open to more manipulation and like you say sometimes the management let us down badly.

2136 2018-05-12 04:00:25 Yeah, that's why pharmaceutical stocks went up with a sigh of relief after Trump announced he wasn't going to bother negotiating with them.

2140 2018-05-12 03:58:33 While investing, we must choose stocks with due diligence. Today's leaders may not turn out to be tomorrow's leaders. Nokia is one such example. 
We must keep a close watch on our holdings like a Falcon.
2141 2018-05-12 03:56:56 so we just might have to wait and see what a judge says if the ban is challenged in court. It's reasonable to question how effective this legislation can be when bump stocks are legal in the rest of the state (as in right across the city line).(3)

2153 2018-05-12 03:42:51 yes, exactly. stocks are ownership (equity) and bonds are debt. some bonds are special though: some can turn into stock, some are issued only by cities (municipal), some are junk, and some can be low-yield.

Trump @RealDonad_Trump did that.

Trump did that.

Thanks!
2305 2018-05-12 01:46:49 Does #Trump actually think that forcing foreign countries to pay more for American-made pharmaceuticals is going to lower prices here? It's no surprise that pharma stocks went up after his speech. #BigPharma still has the US government by the balls

2415 2018-05-12 00:12:44 Seems one of the biggest downfalls for anyone is price chasing.  OTC as well as any stocks.  FOMO is real, but missing out is a myth.
2416 2018-05-12 00:12:40 The top five stocks that fell today were $SYMC, $FLS, $NWSA ( $NWS ), $PPG, and $PPG.
2417 2018-05-12 00:12:20 "The deep state is the military industrial complex, theyre winning. Defense contractor stocks are skyrocketing, Trump is de facto arms salesman-in-chief. The neoliberal establishment is who hates him bc he removes the mask of empire & makes it less palatable to sell imperialism."
2418 2018-05-12 00:11:14 The top five stocks that gained today were $REGN, $IQU, $VRTX, $D, and $CVS.
2419 2018-05-12 00:10:40 You have to be fucking kidding, Susan. Keep your spin to yourself. Pharma stocks rose today; all the CEOs excited. All bluster, no bite, and you totally played once again. 
#SelloutSusan
2420 2018-05-12 00:10:09 The top five most active stocks today were $SYMC, $AMD, $BAC, $NVDA, and $GE.
2421 2018-05-12 00:09:48 Trump has stocks in Pepsi Cola, may be in some Pharma companies too . His self interest is being served first then the nation just as Nixon was known for his notorious corruption.
2422 2018-05-12 00:09:42 Buying back shares helping the richest 10 % of Americans who own 80 % of all stocks
2423 2018-05-12 00:09:24 Stocks aren’t about confidence. They have cash flows. It’s not about crashing. It can obviously crash. There is a point of no return though
2424 2018-05-12 00:09:14 I’m chill I’m just wondering how you think he’s gonna just not make any noise? If he finds it funny he gon laugh
2425 2018-05-12 00:07:14 It has crashed before. Some people will see it as an opportunity and eventually it will gain traction again. Stocks have crashed, but they came back
2426 2018-05-12 00:06:21 So, don't invest in stocks?
2427 2018-05-12 00:06:07 But quotas have saved fish stocks from total wipeout. Not much of an industry if there are no fish!
2428 2018-05-12 00:05:35 That's what I was thinking 
2429 2018-05-12 00:05:25 my thoughts exactly. 81-31 fouls to stocks ratio is also a major red flag for me
2430 2018-05-12 00:03:47 Russell 2000 almost reached new high but failed. There is triple top in Russell. Is it significant? Possibly. It may indicate stocks are hitting severe resistance. Severe fall maybe just around the corner. Precious metals indicating that break out is near. Time will tell soon.
2431 2018-05-12 00:03:35 (1) It *is* an asset. If you sell it for a profit and don’t claim that as income, that’s tax evasion. (2) This is the same way stocks work. You pay income tax (or claim a loss) upon *sale.* You don’t pay anything if they go up and you don’t sell.
2432 2018-05-12 00:03:32 That explains why pharmaceutical stocks went up after his speech today
2433 2018-05-12 00:03:08 @BTS_twt have you ever feeling so sad? even you cannot express it by crying. it's like you want to cry but there is no any stocks of tears you have. What should I do? I'm serious.
2434 2018-05-12 00:02:46 Tengo Robin Hood  Pero no todo el mundo debe invertir en stocks. Al menos tienen que entender lo básico. Conozco personas que perdieron 12%  empezando por invertir al garete
2435 2018-05-12 00:02:43 Settle down
2436 2018-05-12 00:01:44 Getting into stocks soon. #investing
2437 2018-05-11 23:59:39 What does it mean if PhRMA/Bio stocks see a huge bump following the WH announcement on lowering Rx prices? Asking for a friend.
2438 2018-05-11 23:59:10 This isnt proof that he wants forced serialization or to create pharmaceutical zombies all this is saying that that people invested in the companies after he talked about the market. This happened with gun sales/ stocks everytime Obama talked about gun control. It proves nothing.

2445 2018-05-11 23:58:12 Investment is rarely driven by the tax rate but rather return on the investment - economics 101. US corporations have been sitting on trillions$ without finding suitable investments. Yes for those of us that own stocks and get dividends and CG it’s discretionary spending.
2446 2018-05-11 23:57:49 When the stocks went up during Obama's reign, you guys were bragging that they were going up.
When stocks go up while Trump reigns, it's a disaster.
I'm confused...
2447 2018-05-11 23:56:32 @realDonaldTrump massive corruption. Pharma is smiling & their stocks soared when they heard they're still in control as your plans will make very little difference to them. Corruption will continue...but put in competition from Canada and watch them panic & prices drop!

2453 2018-05-11 23:53:40 Complete lie. What did Big Pharma stocks go way up after this announcement? Because these fake measures will do nothing to their big prices
2454 2018-05-11 23:53:05 Exactly - balancing tax loss harvesting of stocks in taxable vs bonds in tax-deferred is better done through managed accounts (robo, human or cyborg), than in a single MF or ETF product, especially given different individual tax situations

2484 2018-05-11 23:47:04 What ATT did was not unusual.  Access and influence trading is to Washington what stocks and bonds are to Wall Street.

If you took a poll of firms on K Street, there are more shoes to drop.
2485 2018-05-11 23:46:48 Ni siquiera están aplicando una receta.... reconozcamos que la receta duró 12 años y quemaron bastantes stocks. Pero 12 años!! Hay que entender las reglas del juego y no ser
nenitos caprichosos. Cambió el contexto, deberán cambiar las soluciones.
2486 2018-05-11 23:46:19 Do you have a preferred set of technical indicators for OTC stocks?  I like MACD and RSI to find divergences, and Fib lines for retracements and price points. Some of these stocks are quite hard to see divergences with in RSI...seems hit and miss since they have low volume.
2487 2018-05-11 23:46:10 Drug stocks moved higher today. That means drug companies and investors remain confident the trump drug effort is another con and the drug companies will continue to price gouge all Americans. #VoteThemOut2018 to address the real drug issues.
2488 2018-05-11 23:45:41 Pharmaceutical stocks rose today. They know Trump's two step BS and what he really will do after fooling the minions,
2489 2018-05-11 23:45:27 Tonight's Car Count, 27 Sprints, 15 Late Models, 22 Big Block Modifieds, 19 DIRTCar/RUSH Pro Stocks
2490 2018-05-11 23:45:17 Yep, so pissed that their stocks went through the roof. SMH
Trump dropped the two actions that actually would have lowered Rx prices. Medicare negotiations and purchasing from outside US. Trump actually campaigned on doing both those and you think Big Pharma is pissed. Moron.
2491 2018-05-11 23:44:15 I guess you that the pharmaceutical stocks are up on Monday. That's how you know that Trump screwed over the American people yet again.
2492 2018-05-11 23:43:47 This is a terrible deal. You promised to give Medicare  the power bargain directly with drug companies for lower prices. Drug lobbyist 's didn't want this so you backed off. Drug company stocks rose  after your announcement today. AGAIN, you chose big business over the people.
2493 2018-05-11 23:43:11 So our own government can entirely manage stocks of fish that frequently swim across national maritime boundaries.
2494 2018-05-11 23:42:03 I know of a few stocks u are in there .  They will turn .  But not to 2017 levels . Not this year
2495 2018-05-11 23:40:07 He has stock in several pharmaceutical companies, Im sure he will do whatever makes those stocks grow!
2496 2018-05-11 23:39:43 Why did drug company stocks profit today, Mrs Medical Expert?
2497 2018-05-11 23:38:25 Interesting that pharmaceutical stocks rose sharply after his speech because he abandoned the plan to negotiate drug prices for Medicare recipients. Business as usual - no swamp draining here.
2498 2018-05-11 23:36:32 Lol @jimcramer gets salty at $crypto and hates it cuz he’s had to shill stocks 12 hours a Day his whole life and still can’t tell me what has made more of a profit gain than $btc from 6k to 8.5k JUST THIS YEAR. #waitingcramerwaiting #keepthinkingyouknowitall #sipstea
2499 2018-05-11 23:33:51 He announced this “plan” in order to manipulate the stock market for himself & his cronies.  Just after his speech stocks in pharmaceutical companies rose.
2500 2018-05-11 23:33:20 Karma......Trump and Outrageous Prices..@Disney Stocks and Shareholders Division!
2501 2018-05-11 23:32:19 Why did big Pharma stocks soar on your announcement?
2502 2018-05-11 23:32:19 The fact that #Pharma stocks rose today on @POTUS "plan" to lower drug costs shows who will benefit and it's not the patients.  #PrescriptionDrugCosts
2503 2018-05-11 23:31:39 If that is the case please share buy as well as sell on the same day you do it as many people just buy it based on recommendation but never sell it as no one asked them to sell - just telling from my early days experience - cyclical stocks this can be huge!!

2506 2018-05-11 23:29:51 The basic issue is Al that this guy creates a fantasy circumstance puts up stuff that is factually absurd and then ignores the truth when it's pointed out .

For purposes unknown .I'd say the vast majority of people were really happy getting the heads up on those stocks.

2509 2018-05-11 23:27:00 1/2 I want to scrap the CFP and regain our waters for our fishermen and allow our government to decide how we preserve our fish stocks. I want to scrap the CAP and stop rewarding inefficiency. I want to make the WTD less onerous for small businesses .....
2510 2018-05-11 23:26:29 Then you missed the last job report and now making up your own facts. Manufacturing jobs led in the last job gains, and yes companies are investing as well as buying back their stocks. Cherry picking again is worse than straight lies
2511 2018-05-11 23:26:25 Fishing quotas have helped restore stocks - but anyway have been sold off to foreign fleet. Workers rights are a 2 way thing - may put some burdens on business but also protect workers from exploitation - matter of getting balance right. Yes we could control movement...

2514 2018-05-11 23:25:05 The name did not resonate. I've looked up their site and recognize a title or two. I don't know of a local store which stocks anything they publish. It's not a huge publisher. They don't have a single title in the top 300.
2515 2018-05-11 23:24:50 Put him in the stocks, say in Nazi uniform.
2516 2018-05-11 23:23:23 Boy, Trumps new Pharma cost reduction plan must really be putting the screws to them. All Big Pharma stocks went UP after its release.

That is all you have to know about it. #Hardball
2517 2018-05-11 23:22:51 $lg.v Blue chip stocks are just a market tracker, no skill in that. Research the carnage #lenigas has left behind on every company he's sat on. #lenigas = private investors lose money. Think differently? Find me an example. 
2518 2018-05-11 23:21:31 Ummm, yeah. That’s why their stocks went up when DT announced his plans. Their lobbyists are earning their $280,000,000.00.
2519 2018-05-11 23:21:31 the fact that Apple's stocks are so cheap compared to Amazon's... Jeeze... Jobs really created something formidable
2520 2018-05-11 23:21:07 @realDonaldTrump I noticed the  pharmacy stocks rocketed up after my tough stance on pricing was announced; wink wink, nudge nudge.
2521 2018-05-11 23:20:19 What does it tell you that Pharma stocks soared after the @POTUS announced his “plan” to lower prescription drug prices?
2522 2018-05-11 23:20:15 Man @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney just needs to focus stocks and stay away from $crypto cuz they don’t know jack shit about what they are talking about when it comes to the subject matter. Holy fuck $btc $eth $ltc $icx $nuls #morons
2523 2018-05-11 23:20:08 You know the prez is playing hardball with the drug companies when in response to his plan to cut drug prices, the value of big pharma stocks goes up.
2524 2018-05-11 23:19:21 Funny how pharmaceutical stocks went up after your speech Another bunch of  lies that support the CEOS and rich companies !!
2525 2018-05-11 23:19:13 That’s sure what he said he’d do on the campaign trail. Did you see pharm stocks go up after announcement? Wow , just, wow
2526 2018-05-11 23:18:59 This refers to the recovery of pharm stocks.
2527 2018-05-11 23:18:30 Funny how pharmaceutical stocks went up after your speech Another bunch of  lies that support the CEOS and rich companies !!
2528 2018-05-11 23:18:27 And at the same time pharmaceutical stocks soar. Who you going to believe Trump or your eyes?
2529 2018-05-11 23:17:39 Big pharma stocks shot up today because investors know that Drumpf's proposal will do little to nothing to lower drug prices. Reality.
2530 2018-05-11 23:16:54 Nifty 50 stocks hai...already fallen 15% in 3_4 days...it is nt a small cap . ...that continue to fall... definitely a good buy fr swing trading target 500 plus
2531 2018-05-11 23:16:34 Trump talks about his new drug plan and pharmaceutical stocks surge on the stock market.

You don't really think that's because drug prices are going down do you?
2532 2018-05-11 23:15:51 Put him in the stocks in the public square.

2536 2018-05-11 23:13:20 Hefty fines and possible jail time for all who make frivolous, time-wasting, tax- money-wasting police calls. I would like to put them in stocks, but I guess that is asking too much.
2537 2018-05-11 23:13:11 Interesting that pharmaceutical stocks rose sharply after his speech because he abandoned the plan to negotiate drug prices for Medicare recipients. Business as usual - no swamp draining here.

A likely government coalition, once considered a threat to the Italian economy and the eurozone itself, hasn’t stopped its stocks and bonds from outperforming.

2543 2018-05-11 23:10:30 Interesting that pharmaceutical stocks rose sharply after his speech because he abandoned the plan to negotiate drug prices for Medicare recipients. Business as usual - no swamp draining here.
2544 2018-05-11 23:10:17 President Donald Trump unveiled dozens of initiatives aimed at curbing high drug prices, a raft of modest moves that left the pharmaceutical industry relieved and buoyed their stocks.
2545 2018-05-11 23:09:27 That's why drug company stocks soared today.  Because investors know you're all bullshit. 
2546 2018-05-11 23:09:27 do they actually believe that the left is racist and anti-Semitic or are they just concerned about income tax increasing and the value of their stocks decreasing?
2547 2018-05-11 23:09:12 Tell Minnesota Senate candidate Tina Smith to divest of the hedgefund that she and her husband own. It is filled with pharma and medical device stocks. Let’s keep the swamp on the r side.
2548 2018-05-11 23:08:39 Interesting that pharmaceutical stocks rose sharply after his speech because he abandoned the plan to negotiate drug prices for Medicare recipients. Business as usual - no swamp draining here.
2549 2018-05-11 23:07:26 POTUS breaks promise on allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Drug stocks soar, Medicare recipients suffer. POTUS lacks a soul and you are #complicit with his total lack of humanity.
2550 2018-05-11 23:06:37 Pharmaceutical stocks rose following @realDonaldTrump rose garden announcement today, I think that is a clear sign how much his “plan” will help consumers. #trumpRXscam
2551 2018-05-11 23:05:44 If u were really decreasing costs, pharma stocks wouldn’t have sored after ur announcement. US co’s set prices for other countries. This is more propaganda than anything else to con ppl into voting GOP n Nov so 1% can steal more $ from 99%. Most of us rn’t so easy to con!
2552 2018-05-11 23:03:22 Worth noting that while almost all super funds hold significant bank stocks very few hold any AMP stock
2553 2018-05-11 23:01:21 Hey dummy. Pharma stocks went up. They were happy with Trump’s plan. Think about that.
2554 2018-05-11 23:01:16 Then why did pharma stocks go up today ?
2555 2018-05-11 23:01:09 I guess the pharmacy ‘benefit managers’ were lauding Trump’s comments as a way of giving themselves some time to get short their own stocks.  Typical.
2556 2018-05-11 23:01:01 I’m finna but some more stocks g
2557 2018-05-11 23:00:58 How to trade the stocks short-term.  Not long-term investing (because there are plenty of books and theories for that), but learning short-term trading (in a way that yields profit).
2558 2018-05-11 22:58:44 Mattress company stocks just shot up.
2559 2018-05-11 22:58:43 It really depends on what your end goal is. Different things resonate with different people. Stocks are good but can be a bit tricky with random company events and during the open/close of the day. Futures can over leverage a beginning trader. I prefer Forex because it requires
2560 2018-05-11 22:58:39 What a complete LIE! All the Pharmacy stocks went up today I call BS on your claim!
2561 2018-05-11 22:58:13 Was there a lack of inflation?  Meaning "price inflation"? It would seem to me that there has been significant price inflation in financial assets such as stocks and bonds.  Does price inflation always have to arise in retail prices?
2562 2018-05-11 22:57:53 Donald Trump blasted drugmakers and healthcare “middlemen” for making prescription medicines unaffordable for Americans, but healthcare stocks rose as his administration avoided aggressive direct measures to cut prices.#smoke&mirrors
2563 2018-05-11 22:57:40 Just 1000 shares of $ANET, $REGN & $TREE would have been a steady $100k+ depending on how you traded it and they're not garbage stocks, you have more institutions buying them back up to their highs to back you up, the big boys respond a lot better to emas than the tiny ones
2564 2018-05-11 22:56:46 Sounds like another border wall story with big pharma paying for it.  The telling is that pharma stocks jumped higher on this announcement because there really is nothing in it.  Unlike Mexico in this case you could make pharma pay for it but you don’t dare.
2565 2018-05-11 22:56:34 As a result of Obama’s policies unemployment in at record lows, yet families cannot feed their children. At what point do we stop giving corporations tax cuts so they can buy back stocks and start demanding they pay a decent wage?
2566 2018-05-11 22:56:12 She probably has lots of “call options” on weed stocks, once the bill is passed,she will make lots of money...ever wonder why Pelosi,Maxine r multimillionaires on a gov salary.?
2567 2018-05-11 22:55:51 This is a far cry from Trump’s campaign promise that the government would start a bid process to buy drugs for the VA, military and Medicare. This is a coverup after being caught taking $1.2 million from Novartis. Drug stocks skyrocketed after this announcement.
2568 2018-05-11 22:54:24 .@cvpayne - Steve is right.  I keep 1/2 of my son's savings in my safe, 1/2 in bank. On Monday, it'll be time for him to buy a few stocks.  #MakingMoney
2569 2018-05-11 22:53:56 & i don't blame the retail guy. In a world of jumpy assets (stocks, crypto, RE) its a killer to watch gold just flop. It just hangs in there and then flops into the 1200's or 1100's.

2574 2018-05-11 22:48:02 Thank you! Unconditional patience... Achieved in stocks and now in other areas of life... Thank you!
2575 2018-05-11 22:47:39 What a load of absolute bullshit. If you really wanted to reduce drug prices you would allow Medicare to negotiate with drug companies. But you said no and drug stocks went up today. So you gave them back the money they gave to Cohen.
2576 2018-05-11 22:46:59 /9  Does any country REALLY think their dollars get to where they're supposed to ?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  In the meantime, we're all laughing stocks.  TIGHTEN the fuck up.  AUDIT EVERY SINGLE GOVT DEPARTMENT, and ZERO pay rises until specific OUTCOMES are achieved. SET BY TAXPAYERS.
2577 2018-05-11 22:46:05 Because many stocks which were with 8% gain 5 month back are close to 30%lower today

2581 2018-05-11 22:44:52 Healthcare stocks zoomed up today because experts said the administration avoided taking aggressive and direct measures to cut drug prices. So AGAIN, all talk and NO real action. I'm sure Novartis thanks you (the drug com that paid off Michael Cohen to get to you. Bribes work!
2582 2018-05-11 22:44:49 Today's announcement was not a surprise. The plan had been expected. Drug stocks had been declining in the last few months.  Sell the news, that's what happened today. Laura, you should stick with politics.
2583 2018-05-11 22:44:43 Tell Tina  and Archie Smith to divest  of their hedgefund that  owns pharma and medical device stocks. Talk about swampy.
2584 2018-05-11 22:44:23 So stocks for pharmaceuticals rose sharply after @POTUS plan. Can you guess why? No regulations anymore and just like gas, we will get screwed. @foxandfriends morons get hurt wirse than libs in NY & CA. WE have protections.@FoxNews
2585 2018-05-11 22:44:13 Also agree, all this is down to the supply of Oil to the West. Saudi Arabia has got most of the UK and Europe by the Balls as the World depends on it and they are our main supplier. Imagine when stocks start diminishing I can see all Hell breaking loose.
2586 2018-05-11 22:44:12 Bullshit. Big pharm stocks skyrocketed after your speech. They saw right through you, knowing this was just a campaign speech laden with false promises and lies.
2587 2018-05-11 22:43:35 We know this doesn’t benefit the patients because the drug company stocks all went up today. A weak and ineffective proposal. #AlerttheDaycareStaff #DementedDonnie
2588 2018-05-11 22:43:02 Oh yeah? Then why did all pharma stocks skyrocket today? Because they know your plan will somehow just put more $$ in their pocket.

2593 2018-05-11 22:41:43 BULLSHIT. All you have done is cut healthcare.  And these so called changes to pharmaceutical sales are a joke - their stocks skyrocketed today because investors know they won’t cut profits but add to them.
2594 2018-05-11 22:41:02 Announcement of prescription drugs lowering after announcement pharmaceutical stocks go up...
2595 2018-05-11 22:40:50 You promised you were going to have the Federal govt negotiate with the Pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices. Same as Obama promised when he ran for President.  You let us down like he did! Pharma stocks jumped up with your announcement today# so disappointed in you

2604 2018-05-11 22:35:48 And your plan is so strict that drug stocks prices are on the rise. Why don't you try doing something for the people not big business??

2609 2018-05-11 22:34:01 The stocks started to increase in value after they lied about "growing despite #DeleteFacebook", then using the Q1 numbers to prove it, while the crash started in Q2. Wait till you see the Q2 results. Stocks will fall. Short on $FB then.

2612 2018-05-11 22:31:53 Well ur announcement did nothing to help that. All drug stocks rose as investors know you took the easy way out again not unleashing Medicare to negotiate. It appears strategy is lots of talk and little action. Again under your watch the little guy is last.
2613 2018-05-11 22:31:33 How was your dentist appointment? Stocks were good today

2632 2018-05-11 22:17:52 ... and drug stocks soar. All these lies would be sort of funny if people weren't going to die for the lack of affordable medicine.

2635 2018-05-11 22:15:05 "When big pharm. companies' stocks spike during your big reveal on lowering prices, you're doing something wrong," B.Woodhouse, CD of Protect Our Care, said following Trump's speech. "Don't be fooled: President Trump and his administration are bought and paid for by Big Pharma."
2636 2018-05-11 22:15:03 Drugmaker stocks rose handsomely the day @realDonaldTrump outlined his  new plan for bringing down drug prices–which means Wall Street doesn’t  think his plan will work. Earlier this year, Trump declared that  drugmakers are “getting away with murder”....
2637 2018-05-11 22:14:30 Trump already signaled he'd do nothing on this issue, drug stocks all up today, I'm starting to believe that Mr. Reichert is simply not paying attention.

2643 2018-05-11 22:10:05 Uh huh. Right. Per Axios: 
The Trump administration's plan for lowering prescription drug costs does not include many new steps to bring down the actual price of drugs. It sent pharma stocks soaring.
2644 2018-05-11 22:09:46 I can’t believe I’ve voluntarily spent my time lookin at stocks and their forecasts this afternoon. I need a social life stat
2645 2018-05-11 22:09:28 President Trump why are you not caring out your campaign promise to have the Federal government negotiate drug costs with the pharmaceutical companies?  Their stocks have jumped since you announced your plan.  That's a sign not good for the average citizens.
2646 2018-05-11 22:09:18 Clearly, you’re an imbecile. The shooting happened on a FARM. Farmers have regular rifles...not AR15s. One man snapped and killed his whole family. He didn’t go to town and shoot it up. He didn’t shoot 500 strangers at a concert using bump stocks. 20 years between shootings.
2647 2018-05-11 22:09:14 If stocks for pharmaceutical companies soared after Trump's speech, that means nothing he's doing is good for you. If pharma is making money, that means you're losing.

It isn't "middle men" that are screwing you over, it's owners. Pure greed. Rich people stealing all they can.
2648 2018-05-11 22:08:38 What's SSC?

I googled it and got a stock group. I don't think you're talking about stocks.
2649 2018-05-11 22:07:55 Drug company stocks went through the roof after your announcement. Why, because they don’t think your plan will work. So once again you made a lot of money for the drug companies and the American people get screwed.

Pharma stocks just went up and your "evil greedy" drug comp. middle-men will keep raking in profits on our backs.

Very Swamp like!

2655 2018-05-11 22:03:36 Another fraud from the cheese doodle President. Notice how Pharmaceutical stocks did well on the market today? That means that the industry does not believe anything he announced will impact profits. That means he isn't going to actually save you anything.

Right?
Right?
Well....
2660 2018-05-11 21:56:28 And I suppose @RonWyden's recipe for lower drug prescription costs... is to send pharmaceutical stocks plummeting???
2661 2018-05-11 21:56:15 I call BS...if these are sweeping changes then why are big pharma stocks up? Shouldn’t they be down and scared of what’s  coming? Analysts have said this is big dud..

2665 2018-05-11 21:54:48 Day traders like volatile commodities and volatile stocks. They seek to gain from sharp, sudden swings in the price of what they are trading. Day trading @GrayscaleInvest shares is like day trading on steroids (or, given its addictive qualities, day trading on crack). /2
2666 2018-05-11 21:54:32 The Casspir MRAPs which India shipped into Kashmir when landmines were blighting COIN forces were KEY and they got those pre-owned MRAPs from SA surplus stocks. Let's do this - no dulling.

2668 2018-05-11 21:52:07 @other98 Remember when @POTUS44 got the blame when gas prices increased? Now 45 directly caused higher oil prices and they’re all quiet bc stocks are up n their pockets are getting fatter. It’s all about the 
2669 2018-05-11 21:50:55 What percentage of the stories in each network covered science of transmission and mentioned Ebola outbreaks had always been controlled in the past? Local TV weather reports are proof hype and fear  sells. Fun fact: airline stocks tanked on fears of ebola.
2670 2018-05-11 21:50:19 if you read the tea leaves and stayed out of harm's way for the last three months while working on a list of your top long ideas, and then placed your bets upon last friday's "all clear" morning rally, then this week was a festoon of riches. #stocks $SPY $IWM
2671 2018-05-11 21:50:18 I have listed some rational Solutions. Your turn. This doesn't mean that I don't think we should we not ban bump stocks and military grade AR-15 Etc
2672 2018-05-11 21:49:50 My Pharma stocks are cannabis-based so I’m still waiting for my big payday. Finding a cannabis-based substitute for opioids for pain relief will be huge IMO.
2673 2018-05-11 21:47:57 Looks like the drug company stocks are shrugging off Trump's latest comments re: lower drug prices. I guess they know they still have approx. 538 voices in Congress bought and paid for to help keep prices "fair" (for us drug company shareholders).
2674 2018-05-11 21:46:39 Based on how drug stocks finished today, we won't be seeing any lowered drug prices anytime soon.
2675 2018-05-11 21:46:36 One thing ppl should understand is that stocks are like ladies. Some of them are good to marry,some are only good for a one night stand. A guy that confuses one with the other may get himself into trouble. Cigar butts are not Equity Bonds.
2676 2018-05-11 21:46:30 Sadly, the rise of pharma stocks after Trump announced his so-called plan to lower drug prices tells nothing I didn't already know.

2679 2018-05-11 21:45:49 Just catching up on tweets.Thread re McClaren. Stocks go up & down. He's a great example of that. Dyche, Howe etc will probably be rubbish managers too one day. McClaren & others were once trendy too. So much of management about luck & timing, which is why reputations fluctuate.
2680 2018-05-11 21:44:29 We don’t measure stocks by the number of stocks but by the value of those stocks.

2686 2018-05-11 21:40:45 Big Pharma stocks jump higher on Trump's drug plan- he is filling the swamp with toxic waste and making it worse
2687 2018-05-11 21:40:10 Yet the drug stocks went up today on Wall Street, so Trump words probably mean little.
2688 2018-05-11 21:38:51 Ya doing stocks penny stocks and etf now but seeing ppl make big gains from options so wanna learn it
2689 2018-05-11 21:38:36 drug manufacturers don't seem to worried & neither did investors. their stocks didn't drop at all.
2690 2018-05-11 21:38:23 And yet pharma stocks soared .... hmmm
2691 2018-05-11 21:38:00 All one needs to know: “The Trump administration's plan for lowering prescription drug costs does not include many new steps to bring down the actual price of drugs. It sent pharma stocks soaring.”via Axios....
2692 2018-05-11 21:37:54 Still terrible
2693 2018-05-11 21:37:49 stocks dropping Russia solved maybe not really but probably !. nsa talk.

2702 2018-05-11 21:33:29 The economy grew in spite of regulation . Obama took Stocks from 6000 to 18000 . Trump raised them 5000. Respectable but he has a ways to go to match Obama. Obama lowered deficit. Trump just tripled it.

2704 2018-05-11 21:33:19 You can tell this is really going to make a difference because all the pharma stocks went up. That has to be good for customers, right?
2705 2018-05-11 21:33:16 Drug company stocks all rose today.  That's their vote of non-confidence in controlling drug prices.
2706 2018-05-11 21:32:53 Thanks will pass along.
2707 2018-05-11 21:32:37 Shit is kinda confusing haha I just stick to stocks normally
2708 2018-05-11 21:32:07 Drug company stocks jumped after Trump’s speech on drug prices. Nuff said.

2710 2018-05-11 21:31:16 trump blames drugmakers for high prices! Who? Novartus maybe? Ah, yes, but he didn't do anything to make sure the costs go down. And of course Pharma stocks were up, today. Pay to play.

2741 2018-05-11 21:14:22 The rubes might buy this, but judging by the way drug stocks went up today investors think, as I do, that you're lying again. And weren't you going to replace Obamacare with something great? And what about draining the swamp? You break promises more often than wedding vows.

2745 2018-05-11 21:12:42 If that’s true, why then pharmaceutical stocks went skyrocketing today?
2746 2018-05-11 21:12:04 Is that why all of big pharma stocks jumped after your speech?

2750 2018-05-11 21:09:49 After all the hype, this was just another fluff "speech". No substance, no solutions. The fact that both middlemen and drug companies stocks rose is a very telling sign
2751 2018-05-11 21:09:46 There is so much global data YTD that says beware yet this week inv went ape shit buying US equities on Incredibly light volumes but what matters is direction and that went up like a rocket. The largest 2 funds per Bloomberg reports are now overwhelmingly short US stocks. Wow.
2752 2018-05-11 21:09:32 Big Prescription drug speech was another cavalcade of #lies and deception. Patronizing his base with empty promises disguised as STICKING UP for the "little guy" #BigPharma stocks went UP Not DOWN #Goodluck #Trumpsters #FridayFeeling #MedicareForAll @AlexAzar @ArkansasBlog
2753 2018-05-11 21:08:36 It’s a complete farce. This will do nothing to lower the cost of drugs for Americans. Big Pharma is happy, did you notice their stocks rose right after his speech? #PromiseBroken
2754 2018-05-11 21:08:25 Notice that drug stocks rose after his speech.

2756 2018-05-11 21:06:35 And drug company stocks went up today after announcement because his proposals do not effect profits

2760 2018-05-11 21:05:08 Investors in Big Pharma quickly saw #Trump’s prescription drug plan as just another scam on his base as prices on drug stocks quickly shot up. No reform without allowing #Medicare to negotiate its drug prices. #TrumpRussia
2761 2018-05-11 21:05:01 "I love the poorly educated," trump. Over 2/3 of tax cuts went to corporations, who pay off debt, acquire new companies, and invest in their own stocks. Trump made his friends richer and took a golden shower in the middle class, cutting things like EDUCATION. Sad.

2787 2018-05-11 20:53:53 So then bribery, extortion, threats, propaganda, and promoting the distribution and availability of bump stocks, 100 round magazines and other weapons of mass destruction for pretty much anyone who can make it to a gun show is promoting "responsible gun ownership?"

2790 2018-05-11 20:53:32 Yes. Its about money, not life.  Funny how the pro life party has zero to say about death camps.  Sell them airplanes, oil and misc parts or whatever will make stocks rise and voila. Best buds. Another marketplace to milk.
2791 2018-05-11 20:52:07 All this training/classes/recert for finances talk about #blockchain. Tell me it's not going to be part of everyday life. $btc #bitcoin #crypto Silly rabbit #stocks are for kids!
2792 2018-05-11 20:51:55 Rose Garden politics. Whatever this clown promises, the opposite will happen. Expect to pay more for drugs, America. That's why Big Pharm stocks rose today. They know that's the way it'll play out.
2793 2018-05-11 20:47:51 congrats to @GlutonnySSB for winning albion 3 singles, doubles and crews

considering you entered yourself as a 1-man crew with only 3 stocks it was definitely impressive
2794 2018-05-11 20:46:09 It's interesting that healthcare stocks rise after #trump's blueprint for lowering drug prices was introduced. His supporters may believe it will lower cost but peoplenin the know think otherwise. Sounds like , healthcare and tax cuts doesn't it?

2797 2018-05-11 20:44:11 I don't believe a word he says .  When Azar started speaking drug stocks and Health providers started rising 2 - 7 percent I haven't checked Bloomberg to see what they closed at . Sounds to me like they want to privatize Part D medicare. They will go up .
2798 2018-05-11 20:44:04 Put two and two together.  All the big mmj stocks will use $app $pkg period

2801 2018-05-11 20:41:46 How can you all be so naive? 

If Trumps announcement and your expectations would be true, the stocks of big Pharma, incl. Novartis would go down during the next days. We will see!
2802 2018-05-11 20:41:37 I suspect that even their stocks were bloated.
2803 2018-05-11 20:40:00 Stocks are on the better side of a fine line in Scotland, Norway and Iceland. If we (Scotland) continue to be dictated to by London then the future is not good. #indyref2
2804 2018-05-11 20:39:48 Trickle down has been proven not to work.  Trump and the GOP just tried it again in the US.  Instead of hiring or giving raises to their employees, companies are buying back their stocks and paying out big bonuses to the 1%.
2805 2018-05-11 20:38:04 Im the complete opposite, but after shorting for a while i see areas where i can reverse my positions. So im non biased to an extent but most penby stocks are scams and go down, so for me its all about timing
2806 2018-05-11 20:37:04 They are celebrating, as is the rest of Big Pharma. Drug companies’ stocks jumped UP today after Trump’s speech. Nothing in this proposal will lower the cost of drugs. #PromiseBroken

2820 2018-05-11 20:29:53 Yes can confirm anything less would just be so bland
2821 2018-05-11 20:29:24 Is this like the better cheaper healthcare that covers everyone ? I suspect yes because drug stocks went up on this announcement and that would not have happened if they thought prices were going down would it ?
2822 2018-05-11 20:28:47 Yet pharma stocks rose on this announcement? Perhaps wait to see fine details, which by most accounts isn’t much.
2823 2018-05-11 20:28:26 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for cracking down on big pharma and sending my pharma stocks ip 1.5%. That'll show em!
2824 2018-05-11 20:28:03 Ok. 
2825 2018-05-11 20:27:30 @TFALL68 with an amazing call on $ELECW yesterday at .01
Will be watching next week for sure
2826 2018-05-11 20:27:21 The most effective way to control prices now is to let Medicare negotiate prices. Trump backed away from that. That’s why drug company stocks went up today. This proposal is just a pathetic bandaid that the dumb Trumpsters will cheer. 
2827 2018-05-11 20:26:41 Pharma stocks climb on news that Trump was all hot air on med price reform.
2828 2018-05-11 20:26:09 But having said that I've got my niece's birthday party to look forward to lol in the stocks again lol

2833 2018-05-11 20:23:33 Having trump is like being in the stock market. Stocks tend to overshoot up or down before they level out again. All the nutbag liberals shoot to the extreme one way. And trump is shooting to the extreme the other way. Next president should put us back on course.
2834 2018-05-11 20:21:53 It's a trillion dollar puzzle: Why are stocks going higher, when the 10-30 year spread is contracting? (13 bps now)? Who is right?

2844 2018-05-11 20:15:28 Health care stocks went up as soon as Trump said he's going make the prices of drugs lower.  

That's the stock market saying "He'll find us another way to screw people. Don't worry."

2848 2018-05-11 20:14:31 Healthcare stocks lead S&P higher after Trump speech

NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 inched higher on Friday, helped along by healthcare stocks after U.S. President Donald Trump gave a speech blasting high drug prices but avoided taking aggressive measures to cut them.
2849 2018-05-11 20:13:26 Indeed, volatility has calmed down.  Still have premium opportunities in options... bonds, precious metals.  Even crude oil looks interesting for short-term options; weeklies.  Stocks may be poised for better early revenues.

2854 2018-05-11 20:11:51 Yeah ok, that's why drug stocks ROSE after his announcement.
2855 2018-05-11 20:11:44 Drug prices will be going up for us . I don't believe a word he says . As Azar was speaking drug all drug stocks started rising 2 -7 percent. Sounds like they want to privatize part D medicare to me. Her in Louisiana they sent out 37,000 eviction notices to nursing home patients

2862 2018-05-11 20:08:27 Everyone is arguing about the low volume footprint of this rally. So the correct move for mr. Market  would be to gap up huge on monday with price running away quickly on monster volume to leave the "but it's on low volume" fools behind. #stocks
2863 2018-05-11 20:08:01 Well that was a nothing burger from the porn again Trump.  He's not pushing for Medicare to negotiate drug prices.  Big pharma has paid him off.  All talk but no action.  Drug stocks rose today.  They've got Trump in their pocket.
2864 2018-05-11 20:06:39 did you use stocks or did you make it?
2865 2018-05-11 20:05:54 I don’t watch tv, I read NYT, Chicago Trubune but keep thinking things are bad when unemployment is down, stocks up, ISIS on the run, lower taxes. My god you must have been miserable under the bathroom choice president

2867 2018-05-11 20:04:38 The NRA needs to get onboard with banning all assualt style rifles, bump stocks, and kits to put these type of weapons together.  Too many people are dying from these weapons.  We also need to stop buying guns at gun shows without proper screening and tighten the gun laws.

2871 2018-05-11 20:00:46 i believe that all stocks eventually fall and while some would like to say that all falling stocks rise, this is not true... some do not recover.  owning a stock that goes to zero is foolish.
2872 2018-05-11 20:00:12 Potus goals were okay but Azar’s explanation re incentives may stop increases but doesn’t anything to drive costs down . This is why stocks rebounded after Azar spoke. Disappointing

2889 2018-05-11 19:49:06 Trump campaigned on a promise to let Medicare negotiate drug prices directly with drug companies which is what is needed. Now he's abandoned that. He is a huckster through and through. This "program" is more smoke & mirrors, UNLESS you own pharmaceutical stocks. Then it's great.
2890 2018-05-11 19:48:53 Even though the Dow went down after Trump said we’re pulling out of Iran Tready. Defense stocks went way up.

2903 2018-05-11 19:42:44 I post what is queried. So many queries, what I can tweet of my own is very rare. Have stocks in stable but limit on how much I can spend time on twitter.
2904 2018-05-11 19:42:43 No specifics, & drug company stocks rise - another scam, no doubt.
2905 2018-05-11 19:42:30 I haven't looked yet. Did everyone holding biotech stocks get rich today?
2906 2018-05-11 19:42:22 Drugs will certainly go up . As Azar was speaking the drug stocks started going up 2 to 7 percent.
2907 2018-05-11 19:41:56 The duration of time is not as important as the knowledge acquired within time, being the only measurement you seem to consider. But to humor you, I've been playing penny stocks long enough to make profits and spot bull-shitters, but short enough to desire more knowledge. You?
2908 2018-05-11 19:41:48 Stocks and bonds have an inverse relationship. When stocks are up, bond prices are down. If you are growth minded, you are better served to be in equities versus bonds.
2909 2018-05-11 19:41:43 @SecAzar @realDonaldTrump PBM stocks spiked higher after the drug price announcement today The #PBMmafia doesn’t seem to worried about you cutting out the middlemen. They believe they are untouchable & can’t be shut down

2913 2018-05-11 19:39:56 I think POTUS goals were right but what said Azar left me dumbfounded re taking incentives out eg $1000 with 30% rebate game but you still pay 700 at end of the day . This is why the stocks of the middle men and pharma rebounded because there’s no bad change at the end of the day
2914 2018-05-11 19:39:09 I trade stocks so its ok for me to work from home
2915 2018-05-11 19:38:57 Clearly Big Pharma knows you don’t intend to cut into their profits. All stocks of Big Pharma way up after your “wink wink” speech. #liarliar

2918 2018-05-11 19:37:49 The stock market is calling bullshit on Trump's drug reform. All of the pharma and biotech stocks are surging. They know it's a nothingburger.

2921 2018-05-11 19:37:21 Can't wait for the 30min Trump tirade when he finds out pharma stocks are jumping.
2922 2018-05-11 19:36:58 Right... that's why drug stocks are up, because Americans will pay less?
2923 2018-05-11 19:36:50 #Drug co stocks went up yoday. That means they view this plan as non-threatening. #trump caves to industry againt.

2930 2018-05-11 19:33:04 Lower drug prices is admirable plan by the president. However, he is fighting biggest lobbying force in the universe. The strong rally of these stocks post-speech once again shows that pharma  will win as they did with Obamacare. Only public pressure will enable a true change.
2931 2018-05-11 19:32:08 2nd, I'm talking apples to apples, guy.
Since inaguration day, stocks under Trump are up 22.9% (0.00% YTD.) Under Obama, they were up 30.9% on the same day in his presidency.

And the other economic indicators aren't much better. Bond yields are up pretty significantly, for ex.

2941 2018-05-11 19:27:55 Pharma companies stocks up after announcement of restructuring Medicare drug prices! Does not sound good for seniors.

2943 2018-05-11 19:26:27 People who traded the dotcom boom said that the signs of the end were when everyone and their mother was talking about the tech stocks they were trading...and that's when they should have gotten out
2944 2018-05-11 19:26:14 Biotech stocks went up. Most of the drug companies dumped.
2945 2018-05-11 19:23:48 Their stocks are essentially laughing at Trump's "plan."
2946 2018-05-11 19:23:34 It says a lot about the plan that during the Secretary's press briefing @CNBC and Fox Business are displaying the stock prices for Biotech Pharma stocks and most are up.
2947 2018-05-11 19:23:32 Perfect. Lets drive drug company stocks down so you can move in and buy at a reduced rate, then increase costs again. I know
 what you are doing and it is not in the publics interest.
2948 2018-05-11 19:22:20 Business is business, doesnt matter what kind, either the game is using money from investors which is being paid back in either % of revenue or stocks in the company, or using money from revenue which only includes founders packs and microtransactions atm since its closed.
2949 2018-05-11 19:20:58 I agree drug stocks are going up maybe its a relief rally
2950 2018-05-11 19:20:05 El año pasado terminaron con un stock de 12 mill de tn. Va a ayudar a moderar la seca de este año pero no me parece la mejor forma de verlo comparando venta sino acumulación de stocks

2954 2018-05-11 19:18:42 I applaud @POTUS attempt to lower drug prices. This plan won’t work, it’s all smoke and mirrors. The best sign of that is that pharma /bio tech stocks are all up 2-5% today.
2955 2018-05-11 19:17:55 All drug stocks going up 'check Bloomberg. Since Azar is speaking.
2956 2018-05-11 19:17:39 Following the Trump announcement, Big Pharma stocks were up. And that should tell you all you need to know about who's important to Buddy Carter.
2957 2018-05-11 19:16:37 yea, just like you were going to eliminate 'bump stocks' and

stocks were in a parabolic move overbought in any sense, which now has been corrected, different story.

We are discussing YTD 2018 returns and you present data which is from 2017! Keep up.

And by the way... if you're  talking term of service (since election and/or inauguration day), stocks under Obama have outperformed Trump by a significant margin.

2989 2018-05-11 19:02:40 I made more than $80,000 in a passive account with Vanguard when stocks were up all 2017. They are down now, but the worst of the trade wars are over.

3015 2018-05-11 18:52:34 @trish_regan The reason Pharma stocks are up is because they will be able to charge more for their drugs abroad which will more than make up the decrease in revenue they will sustain in the US.  This will be a trade issue.
3016 2018-05-11 18:51:17 TSC™ (Trump Swamp Drainage) has been a ponzi scheme right form the start and is headed to chapter 11, now that Trump has cashed his stocks.

3017 2018-05-11 18:51:15 If you are talking about an ETF held in a taxable account, I would suspect it is even more tax efficient to split holdings (bonds in tax-deferred, buy and hold stocks in taxable) and manage the rebalance/glide path via contribution weights.
3018 2018-05-11 18:50:45 What about a target date lineup that went outside the standard sliding scale of stocks and bonds? Would anyone dare add Tactical/trend/alternatives to the mix?

3037 2018-05-11 18:40:13 No, don't do that. There's a very specific takeaway from this & I'm not sure you're seeing it. I was literally being put under pressure and at risk with the expectations.

3135 2018-05-11 17:59:12 from this learning experience, when asked how I got started of in mid 90s, I would say I got lucky then learnt the hard way, therefore would want people to try a pick at a time or pick single stocks until 30-100K portfolio value. and of course many can also get lucky, probability

3138 2018-05-11 17:56:59 The scheme the #ATF is attempting to pass would cripple our Second Amendment in a dangerous way. Their proposed rule change to ban bump stocks could be interpreted by an anti-gun administration as a total semi-automatic rifle ban.

3142 2018-05-11 17:54:06 therefore, unless you get lucky, imho, start investing with small money outside picking individual stocks until you have amassed at least $30-100K, probably within 5-7 years of about 5K put in yearly into investments.

3145 2018-05-11 17:53:09 Currently, the proposal coming from the ATF is designed to change the meaning of the word “machine gun” under legal code to accompany bump stocks. The intention is to make bump stocks and machine guns the same thing under legal code.

3147 2018-05-11 17:51:56 though it’s hard to see this in a universe restricted to public stocks, it seems like there should be some variation with size or age. obviously to become a public firm, you had to have accepted external finance in an IPO. growth startups use external finance (but most fail).
3148 2018-05-11 17:51:56 My thought process regarding a basket of stocks, not just picking a basket for the sake of a basket, is to try to mitigate risk amongst my picks. Diversity of say 3-5K per name over say, 10-20 names for a total value of 30K-100K portfolio size, hopefully over 2-3 sectors, too.

3188 2018-05-11 17:29:38 ... Since stocks have no defined maturity, buybacks or dividends are the only ways to return excess capital to equity holders. Then the excess capital is then free to be redeployed elsewhere?  At least, that's how I have come to think of the issue

3234 2018-05-11 17:05:08 my question to stock market bears is where do you admit you're wrong? Do you just short stocks and hope for the best? What is the price level(s) or event that will allow you to admit you got it wrong? tia

3237 2018-05-11 17:04:28 I see crypto as a general technology for conveting the illiquid, opaque, and offline into digital economic networks. Storage, compute, stocks, bonds, property title, tickets... An extension of the trend of eBay, Uber, AirBnb, etc. It's about markets, not money.

3242 2018-05-11 17:00:51 John, if you want “more gun safety”, how can you be against: 1) getting ride of semi automatic assault weapons (they were developed for military not citizens)? 2) making bump stocks illegal? 3) background checks for all gun sales?
3243 2018-05-11 17:00:42 Addendum: Invest in bank stocks .... just don't deposit there!
3244 2018-05-11 16:59:33 of course he will do something! He Will promise to raise the age to 21 , ban bump stocks, and then he'll have 2 closed door visits with the NRA, go to their next meeting, and tell them their 2nd amendments rights are under siege. right POTUS?
3245 2018-05-11 16:59:16 Agree. If someone can explain why stronger background checks would be bad for anyone except criminals who shouldn't have guns, why anyone needs high capacity cartridges, bump stocks or military style assault weapons, I'm listening.
3246 2018-05-11 16:58:03 Budget deficit decreases due to low good imports, but this doesn’t mean that your exporting performance gets better. Of course it attracts foreign investors since your company stocks are dirt cheap but it’s not something that you should be proud of.

3257 2018-05-11 16:53:31 You know the old adage about stocks that stop going down on bad news? Garbage crypto stocks have been going down pretty much every day. Crypto had somewhat of a breakdown overnight and most of these stocks are green today. Interesting...

3259 2018-05-11 16:51:54 No, if stock markets close you don't necessarily get anything at all. Studying the Anglo-Saxon (US, UK) markets is looking at the winners. Not all shareholders have been so lucky. But we're not comparing apples with apples. I'm not anti-stocks but rather pro-purchasing power.
3260 2018-05-11 16:51:32 Mining rewards more then exchange fees. But stocks are not a zero sum game, as they pay dividends or get bought back, so in the long run, you get more money then you spend if the company is profitable.

3274 2018-05-11 16:47:13 It doesn't matter if it's murder or suicide.  It's still gun violence.  Why can't you repukes get that? No one is trying to take your guns  if you are not a criminal and you are mentally healthy.   No one has a legitimate reason to own bump stocks or assault rifles.
3275 2018-05-11 16:44:23 Will STO’s be more expensive than ICO’s since it is an acutal property or stocks etc?
3276 2018-05-11 16:44:22 Hi RAF, that was very frustrating. Excellent close today at 10.3%. Certainly helped to give a good result for today with a few stocks going a bit askew
3277 2018-05-11 16:44:10 Because sometimes stock markets close and never reopen. At other times they can haemorrhage value in real terms. It's not a binary decision: a sensibly balanced portfolio can accommodate listed stocks as well as precious metals and plenty else.
3278 2018-05-11 16:43:59 Yeah, not too difficult once you find a pharmacy who stocks it.
3279 2018-05-11 16:43:06 I want all of this.  Safety first.  The 2nd amendment does not guarantee bump stocks or assault rifles.

When stocks tumble talking heads will say 3% is end of world again and stocks are going to zero. Let’s get rational guests!

3585 2018-05-11 14:14:21 @CNBC Questionable reasoning by Dryden that investors are getting back to fundamentals. Yes earnings are good but many stock fundamentals indicate stocks are over priced.

3725 2018-05-11 13:05:25 You can observe "Increased out of stocks" but you claimed "Viability issues" and failed to provide evidence to support your claim. Hence, you havent provided any evidence on your stories yet!

3736 2018-05-11 12:58:47 Yeah, those automatic bows... you know, the bump-stocks that make them so appealing for mass murderers? The bump-stocks will allow them to fire at a faster rate than “assault weapons”.

3751 2018-05-11 12:49:37 You've all seen me post much on being selective on stocks. Today presents a good example. You want the hype of $ROKU or the results of $TTD?
3752 2018-05-11 12:49:34 We’re pouring into the data now on a more broad basis, but the initial take seems to show that portfolio construction is the driver of returns in inefficient spaces like small cap, where as in large-cap stocks selection is the differentiator between top and bottom performers
3753 2018-05-11 12:49:26 $BVTK SO IF A BASHERS BEEN HATING STOCKS POSTING NEGATIVITY FOR YEARS AND EVERY DAY AND SAY " WE CARE FOR YOU" THATS BS!!
3754 2018-05-11 12:49:25 just makes me happy that one of the 2 biggest shareholders of a major fraudulent bank keep telling us how bad their open source, 24/7 open and fast competitor is and they would bet against it.

3764 2018-05-11 12:43:04 In Illinois Democrats legislate to ban bump stocks, raise the age to buy assault weapons from 18 to 21, and require gun dealers to have a state license.

3797 2018-05-11 12:24:15 So I'm ok with all of this however I am much more concerned with the mental health aspect behind guns, the problem is some gun owners will be resistant to Assault weapons ban since it's more of a mental health problem and banning bump stocks
3798 2018-05-11 12:24:12 I will gladly explain that I supported the better candidate, one who supports raising the age to purchase guns, better background checks, banning bump stocks, and more. One who also has a better chance to beat the R candidate, one who did not send a city into default.

3801 2018-05-11 12:22:51 My point was simply that your tweet spoke of the relationship between stocks and claims while your chart was showing claims and recessions. And your study seems to reveal stronger evidence of claims being a coincident indicator rather than leading.

3832 2018-05-11 11:59:49 what do I suggest for getting people to say H "correctly"? Personally I would like a national campaign and some kind of public shaming - rotten tomatoes in the stocks, custard pie in the face, sit under a bucket of gunge, that kind of thing :)
3833 2018-05-11 11:58:01 i was really thinking about this and after reading the article all of the stocks you were basing it off were all industrial grade #3dprinting and not a 3dprinter that would be on a consumer desktop market ,the main exemption would be $DDD for when they did their cube
3834 2018-05-11 11:57:59 buddy you just wait until whoever stocks the sweet potatoes at the grocery store gets it
3835 2018-05-11 11:56:41 Personally I think 5-10 stocks is the right number for an individual investor. Hard to keep up with more and do your due diligence.

3843 2018-05-11 11:49:15 Hi @FredtheKaiser Glad you are keen on investing in stock. Stockbrokers not only buy and sell stocks on your behalf but they can also advise on your investment options. The remaining 3 Stockbrokers Jito missed out on: Autus Securities, Equity Capital & Stockbrokers Zambia. #LuSE
3844 2018-05-11 11:49:08 $NVDA $DBX with bad reactions to good numbers all while price targets are lifted. This action creates a lot of confusion as traders have a strong believe now that the bad reactions  are a perfect entry for a long. Will the market really be so kind to longs? #stocks #nasdaq
3845 2018-05-11 11:47:44 Can’t even blame the booze in this case. D’you reckon I can claim I always end calls by assertively shouting ‘CAROLINE’? 
3846 2018-05-11 11:46:58 you are too late to ask this, but I didn't see any fundamental problem with this company. technically 111 will be last important support. 

I suggest, never invest all capital in a single stock always distribute money in 5-10 stocks of different sector for investment .
3847 2018-05-11 11:45:41 Really? Oil stocks were flat to down yesterday?
Or maybe it was the decline in volatility?
Or the crowded shorts and High Put/Call ratio?
Or maybe neither of you know anything??
3848 2018-05-11 11:45:38 Actual LOL. The cringe is so very, very real.
3849 2018-05-11 11:45:28 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your phantom limb syndrome
3850 2018-05-11 11:45:09 I am divorced and planning to retire. Is my ex-spouse entitled to a share of my pension?Under New York law, pensions earned during the marriage are considered marital property, along with other assets acquired during the marriage,such as houses, cars, stocks, and joint bankacct
3851 2018-05-11 11:44:35 You think this will affect stocks like $ABBV?
3852 2018-05-11 11:43:33 I mean, I was hungover. I still laugh about it to this day.

3862 2018-05-11 11:38:30 Just left an answerphone message where I said ‘okay, thanks bye’ and then inexplicably said my name very loudly. I then wailed in panic, fumbled with every button to try to delete the message, and pressed ‘end call’ in the process. 

There’s that pitch in the bag.

3865 2018-05-11 11:36:16 Can you get borrow on Lifull? Japanese stocks are notoriously difficult to short. With the current discount + downside protection clause up to ~10% it’s hard to see how you would lose money. Lifull doesn’t look expensive and yen is a safe haven currency if overall markets fall
3866 2018-05-11 11:36:08 Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's "Ok, God Bless" to management on #federalbank con-call seemed more like a  farewell remark  #Markets #Stocks
3867 2018-05-11 11:35:52 Hi. I've learnt how to trade and research stocks. Also not to force a trade.  
Con side maybe should of waited before having a broker. Still much yo learn

3873 2018-05-11 11:29:54 I like $S volume easy in and out. Reason I can buy without dividend also cheap stocks
3874 2018-05-11 11:27:38 Stocks looking good this morning 
3875 2018-05-11 11:27:16 So do you.... bump stock ban is much more than just bump stocks
3876 2018-05-11 11:24:42 I know it was a joke ;) but I seriously don't want to be in stocks. Would be so boring.

3879 2018-05-11 11:21:01 Hi @AnilSinghviZEE  ji I'm a big admirer and a follower of yours and waiting since long to like my twittes and take a call on  stocks like sintex plastic and Atlanta ehich 8s recommended by Dd dharma
3880 2018-05-11 11:20:09 this is how scammy penny stocks delude their share-holders..

it’s quite pathetic..
how about if you @myceliumcom would earn your money instead..
3881 2018-05-11 11:19:59 The new bull narrative is that collapsing yield curve good for stocks....
3882 2018-05-11 11:18:35 Stick to Graphite stocks. They still have value ahead.
3883 2018-05-11 11:17:58 When my son is school
age, I definitely want to move back to Germany and get my PhD since tuition is free in there. I can dive back into my career field if I'm really itching to get out of the house. But right now I just wanna enjoy motherhood, trade stocks, & design clothes.
3884 2018-05-11 11:17:35 Anyone else find it incredibly strange (perhaps suspicious?) that, on bloody, red days...
1) It is usually most, if not all, coins,
2) The % drop is consistent,
3) It happens at nearly the same time,
4) It's not limited to one $crypto sector like would happen with #stocks.
3885 2018-05-11 11:15:38 Depends on your timeframe. Equity markets will do well in the first year of recovery but gold/silver will far outperform through the entire cycle. Mining stocks will be to the next cycle what technology stocks (particularly dotcom) were to the '90s. Passive to face distribution.
3886 2018-05-11 11:14:52 If you're done with cheap marketing tricks, can you provide stocks?
3887 2018-05-11 11:14:09 More people need to do it, stocks are low
3888 2018-05-11 11:12:23 Yeah, keep connecting imaginary dots that go nowhere. LMAO TRUMP IN 2020. Get used to it. Economy has never been so great. Stocks never been going so well. People like YOU wallow in misery and failure..
3889 2018-05-11 11:11:37 Investors need to value the importance of #diversifying  their portfolio. The strategy to put your money on a particular sector (that is performing well) hardly works.. like the one I recently came across was highly concentrated on the pharma stocks. #disappointing

3891 2018-05-11 11:09:46 I agree with it all, I don't see any reason to need high-capacity magazines other than to kill as many as possible in a shorter time. Not sure if this was already done, but bump stocks should also be banned
3892 2018-05-11 11:09:41 Do you have any small cap idea in tech stocks?
3893 2018-05-11 11:08:26 The transition from being this big career professional to a stay at home mom doesn't feel like the death of my career at all. I get to explore other passions like motherhood (and never missing a moment as my child develops & grows), daytrading stocks FT, & starting up my company.
3894 2018-05-11 11:08:18 What’s he meant to do just mute himself ?
3895 2018-05-11 11:07:57 Liberty media folks (John Malone) are great turnaround experts and I know they want to push into the USA.   Honestly, I'd rather buy Sirius/XM than buy the Liberty stocks

3911 2018-05-11 10:49:49 Corporations got a 20% tax cut, they are NOT hiring new people! They're raising their own salaries and putting the rest of it in savings or stocks to more than quadruple their money! That's EXACTLY what they're doing, & TRUMP KNEW THEY WOULD b/c that's EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP'S DOING!
3912 2018-05-11 10:49:29 @Nairametrics should endeavour to do more stocks to buy, hold and .... more. It's quite helpful.
3913 2018-05-11 10:48:28 Certainly stocks like AMZN, NFLX, TSLA, TWTR will have to have a more reasonable P/E at some point.  Ouch...

3931 2018-05-11 10:28:34 Always interesting to see how people select stocks.  Noise around quarterly iPhone sales.

3938 2018-05-11 10:24:04 When you invest in stocks, you get the following rights:
1. Voting rights - Eg. Electing Directors etc.
2. Part ownership of a company
3. Right to transfer ownership/sell
4. Right to dividends - Get paid according to number of shares held
5. Right to corporate records and books
3939 2018-05-11 10:23:24 Stock value is a delusion watch the bonds... They don't believe at all what's going on. Bonds are always right, so stock value will reassign in some time to bonds... As long as bonds are going down, the gravity will bring the stocks down.

3942 2018-05-11 10:18:26 Very true. My analysis also gave a SELL signal and in first half hour it gave good opportunity of catching 5-6 points down side. But later market reversed and considering stocks Beta it followed the market. which gave almost 10 points up side. Sir please advice!

4017 2018-05-11 09:03:30 @WheelieDealer I agree that running winners is key.  In reality there aren't many good stocks.  It therefore pays to hold the good ones when you find them.  If a stock has a sustainably high ROCE why ever sell?  Only reason would be if growth prospects are lacklustre (tobacco).

4220 2018-05-11 05:54:14 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

4223 2018-05-11 05:51:14 Currently, the proposal coming from the ATF is designed to change the meaning of the word “machine gun” under legal code to accompany bump stocks.

4310 2018-05-11 04:28:21 benefit of buying stocks when the #market goes cowardly, as it did in 2008, though i was a tad early:

bought a certain stock in July 2008, for $13.30
sold some shares today for $81.70

total return: 514%

CAGR: 20.4% per year for 10 years -- not your mother's return.

4336 2018-05-11 04:04:59 They are all NASDAQ stocks. IMHO, NASDAQ is the stock market for 21st-century companies. NYSE, though, is kinda stodgy, like your grandpa's cigar butt.
4337 2018-05-11 04:04:13 I have three stocks I've been watching. ATM, DBX, and SNAP. SNAP will boom. If you don't see it you're mad. They have a ton of users, they always innovate, and they just got a new successful CFO!!! Why this stock is priced where it's all is amazing. Can't wait until I buy some.

4453 2018-05-11 02:32:20 Eh, no. $RUT 2000 measures small cap stocks. Much more volatile. Given the recent fiscal stimulus (tax cuts), I would expect them to outperform large caps (at least in short term). Reality is stocks in the US are correlated, & tend to move in tandem.
4454 2018-05-11 02:31:03 It's the swamp & the inside info they get. Told what stocks to buy & advised to invest in start-ups that make them super rich. Corruption. Swamp Swamp Swamp.

4460 2018-05-11 02:26:19 It’s based on how much money is invested. The higher the investments the better the stocks. Know ur knowledge before talking plz
4461 2018-05-11 02:25:39 Did u know that is irrelevant? Dow is actually based on the thoughts of how the stocks are going to be, not on how well companies or the economy is. If someone thinks the sticks are good they invest, that investment is actually what makes the stock good not the company.

4516 2018-05-11 01:31:08 It is supposedly easier to earn alpha on a short because less people do it, less people are looking for stocks to short, and analysts at big firms are reluctant to give a sell rating.

4571 2018-05-11 00:44:48 Brains and common sense locked in the box their AR-15's & bump stocks should be stored in.
4572 2018-05-11 00:44:30 Thats the nerve racking part about stocks . When do you take your profit and move on. When is enough, enough. I want all the money b.

4575 2018-05-11 00:41:12 Hello. Is it possible to order your books online? Lagi po kasing nauubusan ng stocks sa bookstores. Masaya naman po mag book hunt pero mainit talaga palipat-lipat ng bookstores at malls. Tapos in the end, walang stock. Lalo na po at nasa Mindanao area ako/kami. @PopFictionBooks
4576 2018-05-11 00:40:25 no my friend,  the markets been just going up on the back of a handful of stocks,  everything else rolling over,  luks pathetically weak,   look at the last few days candles,  does not give confidence,  below trendline,  pull back to the breakpoint also achieved ,  lets see

4581 2018-05-11 00:38:43 @AMarch4OurLives @davidhogg111 BS rhetoric as most of us want sensible gun controls meaning stricter background checks psychological testing age limits assault weapons ban which includes AR15s & bump stocks.
4582 2018-05-11 00:38:23 Bump stocks are for certain types of rifles, not double barrel shotguns.

4584 2018-05-11 00:34:52 Trying to diversify? Try these Obamacare stocks!
4585 2018-05-11 00:32:42 @Fidelity what will happen to sprint stocks if the company is merged with T Mobile?
4586 2018-05-11 00:31:16 You can thank the bashers for that. You can only take so many threats before you turn the IR off. They have done this in a few stocks I have been in over the years.
4587 2018-05-11 00:27:26 "if [speculators] who are playing zero-sum games on top of regular stocks and  commodities can be diverted into ***gold*** (and other pure early bird games like ponzis) instead, maybe that would make for a more ordered financial system" Can you not see this is the same argument?
4588 2018-05-11 00:26:03 45 dollars on a @speckproducts wallet iPhone case and it’s all ripped up in multiple spots in 2 months
4589 2018-05-11 00:26:00 It's so contagious too. Every time he laughs, I start cackling.
4590 2018-05-11 00:24:45 Trump likes it when stocks go up, right?
4591 2018-05-11 00:22:12 Thank you David for the attachment.  I just submitted my request to ban bump stocks.  I really appreciate, and am continually amazed at your diligence.  Thank you again.
4592 2018-05-11 00:21:27 Will never happen
4593 2018-05-11 00:21:09 So I’m totally onboard with your experiment but this is a shocking revelation “you bought Bitcoin before you bought stocks?!” 
Good luck with it and keep that 5% cap tight, has a tendency to get away from you ;)
4594 2018-05-11 00:20:15 Many stocks on the ASX are as risky as the scam quoted. I know from personal experience. Eg Dick Smith and about 500 or so small caps. The asx is a scam in many ways also.
4595 2018-05-11 00:20:04 Meanwhile I’m buying stocks in $xbi and in a few years who knows what happens and by that time $nflx will be worth $1000 a share cause every dip is bought
4596 2018-05-11 00:18:28 なんだ、オルトもドリコムも強いやん。

まだ含み損だからせめてトントンまでは頑張れ〜！
4597 2018-05-11 00:17:18 They lost a lot users and their stocks took a dump haha

4599 2018-05-11 00:13:54 Just got back into #Bitcoin #BTC $BTC @ 8860... not sure how long I’ll be in it again (could be out in 5 min, who knows) - but didn’t think I would get a chance to get back in < $9K this weekend... *To be clear - I still prefer real #stocks, #commodities and #fx over #crypto!!!
4600 2018-05-11 00:13:30 Aussie market off to a better start. #ASX 200 +14pts or +0.25% to 6133. $CBA & banks a weight in early trade. Strong gains elsewhere. Healthcare, mining & consumer discretionary stocks lifting. US$0.7527 #ausbiz
4601 2018-05-11 00:11:43 Still no WW3, Korea is finding peace. Iranians are all thanking Trump for saving them. Employment is low, stocks are high. Come on, what more do you want? You might despise his character but the job is getting done. Its okay to admit that.
4602 2018-05-11 00:11:33 Even Washington State fish and wildlife has said there is no proof salmon farms harm the environment or wild salmon stocks.
4603 2018-05-11 00:10:27 They should have been honest and said "we must protect our stocks" but that's too clever for the NRA. (Avoiding the fact that sales go up when there's any talk of a ban)
4604 2018-05-11 00:10:23 The disease IS the GOP.
29% of Louisiana Republicans blame Obama for Katrina response.
39% of Trump voters think stocks went down; 74% think uninsured rate and 67% believe unemployment rate went up under Obama
46% believe in Hillary’s pizza store sex slave trafficking

4607 2018-05-11 00:08:34 "Management practices that ignore the value of large females could contribute to unexplained declines seen in some fish stocks." is such a powerful sentence
4608 2018-05-11 00:05:50 ive tracked him for so many years i can tell the moment he enters a trade. its always around the same levels, around the same time, and on the same type of stocks. plus the blowoff volume that follows as his chat joins in. also havin his EXACT scanner settings warns me in advance
4609 2018-05-11 00:04:07 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
4610 2018-05-11 00:02:58 Escrowed funds should be included. Just like you include ALL shares when looking at stocks, and not only the FLOAT. I understand Ripple fans prefer to believe whatever may make XRP more valuable.
4611 2018-05-11 00:02:49 You cant go wrong with Canadian Utilities!  Its hard to say which one is better with these utilities stocks.
4612 2018-05-11 00:00:29 From the 50 #stocks in technology sector that yesterday reached all-time highs, picked these:
$ADBE, $EA, $RHT, $NVDA, $NOW, $ADP, $INTU, $CRM
