1 2018-09-22 23:59:55 Yes! Aptly put!

The painful thing is that we seem not to even realize this.

Fixated on oil when the world is post oil.

Well educated human capital, massive scale infrastructure & Healthcare are fundamental to turning things around.

How do we insulate governance from politics?
2 2018-09-22 23:59:49 When you prepare “sofrito” you can add green peppers, red peppers, onions, culantro, cilantrillo (both are Puerto Rican spices, I believe), garlic, olive oil, and if you want to add something else you, do it. You put it all in blender and you have your very own sofrito.

8 2018-09-22 23:58:48 Is it too late to get off oil? If we did, we could just bring our good people home and let the residents of greater Arabia and Persia sort things on their own.

38 2018-09-22 23:56:39 Plavix has a significant bleeding risk; it stops platelet clumping, even when they need to. My patients  use "high gamma E" (Like Thorne Ultimate E) 1 daily. This also reduces myelin damage from "free radicals". Omega 3 fish oil also reduces platelet clumping; eg. Carlson's.

41 2018-09-22 23:55:54 Shampoo branded for women is of a class far higher than degenerate products like axe and old spice, this shit has coconut milk and oil listed as ingredients I literally walk out of the shower smelling like a piña colada how tremendously powerful
42 2018-09-22 23:55:37 cut your onion evenly sized. thoroughly coat in oil. low heat the whole time! add water to lower the heat + rehydrate your onions so they don't burn (+ deglaze if your pan isn't nonstick) should take at least 30 min but your kitchen will smell good
43 2018-09-22 23:55:35 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

46 2018-09-22 23:55:07 shocker (sarcastically uttered) ... so now that the token blurb @cnn is voiced , you can bet a couple 2-3 benjamin’s that will be the end of the

48 2018-09-22 23:54:45 We'd wrap each other in bubble wrap and Wesson oil.
49 2018-09-22 23:54:40 You are aware that oil tankers traverse our coast between Alaska and Cherry Point Washington 24/7, 365 days of the year just 12 miles off BC coast ?? Funny how until Alberta wanted to move more oil to tidewater by doubling KM capacity no one cared one lick about that fact.

Pompeo and Bolton want to start war in our hemisphere. 
Against a strong democracy. 
Maybe they've determined it can be indeterminate for much sales of Raytheon too.

64 2018-09-22 23:51:57 Yes. Cat liter is a vacuums worst enemy. Any oiled or greased parts within the vacuum are died up. Which makes the machine freeze up and stop. That’s why cat litter work so well on drying up oil spots on concrete or any other spill. It may take some time. But it’s very absorbent.
65 2018-09-22 23:51:54 Bomb-starving Yemen to preserve their oil-dominance?! What does Yemen have to do with their oil dominance? I am not saying the Yemen is doing well but the intention you seem to know about is not there. Saudi Arabia want Yemen to be stable and thrive.
66 2018-09-22 23:51:40 A lot of people absolutely need Improve. Improve is kinda like that slimey snake oil salesman that promises a detox to all your pathetic, insignificant first-world problems.

71 2018-09-22 23:50:58 There needs to be two agendas for that day: one if she shows one if she doesn't either way they better be ready to burn the midnight oil.
72 2018-09-22 23:50:49 Car oil is one bolt to take off 
73 2018-09-22 23:50:37 Whattttttttt. Buy your oil and filter. Change it yourself. I pay maybe 30 bucks
74 2018-09-22 23:50:33 I guess it’s beautiful if you believe oil fields are beautiful.  Very flat and dirty.  California remains the most beautiful state in the country.

80 2018-09-22 23:49:36 Neither. Since we don't have tar sands in Canada and solar is unrealistic and kills birds and bats, and takes up far to much land that could be used for sustainable food crops. 
I'll take energy derived from the oil sands.Or energy from hydroelectricity,or energy from naturalgas
81 2018-09-22 23:49:27 Burning the midnight oil... and beyond!

86 2018-09-22 23:48:45 If you're worried about extra bits and bobs in the future, you can always stick the bath oil inside a small piece of nylon! This way the product can still melt away, but it will catch all the extra bits you'd rather not deal with. 
87 2018-09-22 23:48:14 Bought myself a new essential oil and some JMBCO.

89 2018-09-22 23:47:58 When you show me results, sure. So far, i see nothing to suggest trump is doing anything other than grift and peddle his snake oil.
90 2018-09-22 23:47:50 Sounds like business as usual lol. If an oil company wants to drill on your land you take it or leave itthey will pay your neighbor and drill underneath you from there lol. So the Indigenous bands get one last offer and we’re ago in 21 weeks

93 2018-09-22 23:47:09 We'll always have uses for oil and petroleum, we just need to be smart and conscious about it, even if we've switched the means by which we travel, by using smarter energy alternatives.

97 2018-09-22 23:45:41 This not too mention that if your country continues to grow with its dependence on oil till even when it runs out. We may even see Saudi Arabia fight over the oil in places like Antarctica.

104 2018-09-22 23:44:37 Its been since Thursday since I've smoked THC. I've had oil. Moving ahead with the vape. Giving joints a break and doing more CBD.
105 2018-09-22 23:44:34 #storytime / #rant love to go to valvoline to get my oil changed cos it’s usually pretty quick and I can sit in my car.

116 2018-09-22 23:42:13 For sure on Starrett going down. Having said that I see many even most Oil fans giving one of the two Bako spots to Skinner. I would not be surprised to see Starrett to grab one of those two spots in Bakersfield for a good portion of the season. It will be an interesting battle.
117 2018-09-22 23:41:47 I deadass forget about getting an oil change like a big ass sticker isn’t in my face every time I get in my car. Sad smh
118 2018-09-22 23:41:11 Mom: you should make me a BIIIIG painting!
Me: yeah I can do that, but the canvas size you want is like $100, plus I'll need oil paints which will be at least $60, a couple brushes and a spray sealer. So maybe $250 just for materials.
Mom: god you're so negative all the time

The current Govt doubled, even trebled, the taxes on oil to soak up the bonanza; and made the problem worse by spending it on grand welfare programmes that are notoriously inefficient and leaky.
128 2018-09-22 23:39:59 it's probably is only CBD oil. Fantastic for seizures. Contains NO THC . no hallucination properties. I wish people were more educated about weed. It is not only a drug to get high from. It is so good for a number of medical conditions.
129 2018-09-22 23:39:37 Nope, not even close to the same. Oil and gas companies donate to political parties for legislation purposes, just as many companies do. That is not even close to being equal to creating products and marketing campaigns that are politically focused.
130 2018-09-22 23:39:22 I think they’re great . For me , the Lays pickle flavor isn’t strong enough . I taste too much of the sunflower oil they use to make them

133 2018-09-22 23:38:35 I remember that night @JacobAllen1a your old shoes had oil and holes all over them and Greg went to the trailer and cane out with new shoes and gave them to you. The look on your face was priceless because Greg just gave you a pair of new shoes. But that was Greg
134 2018-09-22 23:38:33 That head to toe  oil is the bomb!
135 2018-09-22 23:38:31 If you leave out the majority of the oil, it’s much less calorific but still tasty! 
136 2018-09-22 23:38:06 Of course, , and I don't like our dependence on Saudi Oil, much less the petro dollar altogether, but what "renewable energy" by way of Tesla is about to ruin Saudi Arabia?
137 2018-09-22 23:37:45 It wasn't for oil, it was for Israel. Have a look into the 'Yinon Plan', our soldiers are simply cannonfodder to these people.

146 2018-09-22 23:35:38 Some happy things this week:
-successful (fun) emergency management
-Watching my mom smile at the beach
-one less exam 
-good, floral olive oil
147 2018-09-22 23:35:23 Shea Butter and cocoa butter oil
148 2018-09-22 23:35:23 nutox, hada labo and simple the best cleansing oil. biore ada mineral oil so depends on skin. ada yang sesuai, ada org dia tak sesuai dgn mineral oil
149 2018-09-22 23:35:06 I wasn't talking about the report.  I was talking about its topics.  Climate change caused by fossil fuel use was already under common discussion, and not just behind closed doors at Big Oil.
150 2018-09-22 23:35:05 Also -- about the 900/9-3:

They are good cars, better than people think. But... worst Downsides are: front suspension design is stupid, rust problems on front struts, power steering lines rust/leaks, engine+tranny oil leaks.
151 2018-09-22 23:34:54 There are very few smells I enjoy more than warm olive oil in a pan.
152 2018-09-22 23:34:46 For lip balm on the cheap, swipe some of your own face oil with your fingertips and apply to your lips!  #beautyhacks @OnlyEatRadishes
153 2018-09-22 23:34:43 このひとのライブ行ったぞ私
154 2018-09-22 23:34:39 Adding oil is not changing it  who raised yall? Nd you wonder why ur shit smell like its ready to fry some chicken
155 2018-09-22 23:34:33 Woo! For a smidge more contrast, have the skin a slightly lighter grey  
Nuln Oil for the win!
156 2018-09-22 23:34:27 That sounds "environmentally friendly" to block cheap and efficient domestic natural gas while that requires almost ZERO energy to transport via pipelines, but instead require very expensive imported gas that needs to be first liquefied overseas, then use oil fueled tanker ships
157 2018-09-22 23:34:26 take a bath with tea tree oil/get a bath bomb with tea tree oil and smush it up and put it at the bottom on your shower so when you take one your shower will turn into a giant oil diffuser
158 2018-09-22 23:34:05 It's Tolbi seafood pasta！ With lots of olive oil and basil！（トレビ）
159 2018-09-22 23:33:55 Yes that's right..The people live hell with these Arab rulers...The only reason is the Iranian economy and oil
160 2018-09-22 23:33:48 LOL, Canadian oil is worthless.

Tar sands yield very low quality oil.
161 2018-09-22 23:33:09 #Insiders #ScumMo is adroit, it’s his style. No substance, just a political opportunist who’s quick on his feet, like the snake oil salesman he is #ElectionNow #VoteThemOut2018 #auspol
162 2018-09-22 23:33:06 I guess to get help, from the mainland, Puerto Rico would have to, discover
oil. Of course than it would be further exploited, so I guess that won't work.
Maybe if America showed some humanity/empathy toward fellow Americans,
but wait, Americans don't do that on the mainland.
163 2018-09-22 23:33:00 I had an accident this evening. It was fucking horrible. There was oil on the road and no signs so I span out 3 or 4 times, car cut out and landed on a verge before a dual carriageway. I’m assuming that all my bad luck has led up to this because I am unharmed and so is my car
164 2018-09-22 23:32:58 мне обычно oil based попадаются темные оттенки не масс-маркета. типа, фиолетовый, темно-зеленый. Хотя они все были разных марок, поэтому я не шарю в чем замес и куднт кер лес.
165 2018-09-22 23:32:36 Ooooh!! Do you use fresh mint or an oil?
166 2018-09-22 23:32:08 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Nigel
167 2018-09-22 23:31:50 did nigel farage spend any time in bolton today? a pint at the famous man & scythe maybe? all the chaos he's caused is starting to annoy me less than the fact that this snake oil salesman is STILL cashing in.
168 2018-09-22 23:31:48 I love Lancaster tanning oil:) same company?
169 2018-09-22 23:31:33 Uhhhh he didnt have anything to do with the decision. Nice try tho. Nice looking trains, bet the owner is connected with the opposition that did have a say in delaying the project (that pipes the oil to the coast so it can go to its single destination in California. #readalittle
170 2018-09-22 23:31:31 Not a single oil is produced in my body I swear

Please resign.
172 2018-09-22 23:31:26 おはあり～！！
173 2018-09-22 23:31:21 Its all about oil!!!!!!!!!!!
174 2018-09-22 23:30:45 Energy in the form of oil goes direct to the EU.
175 2018-09-22 23:30:39 It’s amazing how other countries are polluting the environment with industrialization and the world is almost close to quiet about it. Yet issues of oil palm cultivation and palm oil production have bcom a problem? Simply  amazing #biasedworld.
176 2018-09-22 23:30:23 Sound the siren, we already have a winner! 

Base coat from a rattle can? Tick!

Nuln Oil the shit out of it? Tick!

Love it.
177 2018-09-22 23:29:54 That’s literally the only serious talks my dad has with me is about getting an oil change 
178 2018-09-22 23:29:53 @GovRaimondo @GinaRaimondo RI law from 2006 if forcing RI consumers to pay more for items than in neighboring states due to the fact that companies will not honor rebates to RI residents.  I lost $21 in oil rebates from @ShellRotella
179 2018-09-22 23:29:14 Don't listen to that one guy. Get synthetic. You can run that oil much longer. But still check it every once in a while
180 2018-09-22 23:29:12 The newest oil in @doterra’s line up is a much anticipated blend that will make their customers less of raging cunts to food service workers
181 2018-09-22 23:29:02 in the 18 h the body has the time to digest (a big job) and the rest of the time the body will be fighting the illness,  also cannabis oil helps, all dark berries, blackberries .. everyday. tee made of organic dandelion root, Dandelion Tea Kills Cancer Cells In Just 48 Hours....
182 2018-09-22 23:28:50 Also more than the rest of the oil roster combined.
183 2018-09-22 23:28:49 land whales need to be hunted for there oil to power the streetlights
184 2018-09-22 23:28:44 You want all our National Parks sold off to the highest bidder, trump already gave permission to drill oil in them. We need to flush all those whacky Republicans out tRump included and all his unqualified people that work for him, they don’t need jobs they are all wealthy.

188 2018-09-22 23:27:44 You know what would really make my life proud as a Canadian citizen that you f*** off and let us thrive with our energy and I'm talking personal energy not oil energy you're the dumbest son-of-a-b**** I've ever heard of in my life
189 2018-09-22 23:27:43 Science, math, architecture, poetry, literature, medicine.. these are only a few that comes from my nation.. what has your nation of violence and idiocy brought to the world ever? You are nothing without oil, relying on oil, a sickness that you infested the region with..
190 2018-09-22 23:26:30 lavender oil > your mother.

192 2018-09-22 23:26:04 My cooking skills are being tested. I'm hungry but for some reason there's no oil in the house.
193 2018-09-22 23:26:01 The more EVs produced the cheaper they get andn with maintenance cost and oil prices EVs are going to be way cheaper to own. So those people that are struggling from paycheck to paycheck will have an easier time
194 2018-09-22 23:25:51 Society has had it for a while.

Hard to wean the babies off their gas loving cars.

Hard to wean the policians off their oil loving donors.

Hard to change the marketing campaign built idea that cars aren't the same as freedom.

Society can't be fixed so easily.

199 2018-09-22 23:24:08 japanese people love to fry things. they are strong in the ordeals of frying things. hot oil. leftover egg mixture. clumped crumbs and flour
200 2018-09-22 23:23:48 That is what I thought but then it has been thoroughly processed to remove the sugars and converted to alcohol just as plastic is crude oil distillate. Objectively there is at most a trace of barley left but as you say all spirits would be alcohol, water and possibly colouring.

205 2018-09-22 23:22:30 have had a migraine all day and a nap/ibuprofen didn’t work so i got desperate and put some peppermint oil on my temples and now i can’t fcking see
206 2018-09-22 23:22:30 Maybe I can put coconut oil on my grades to repair them
207 2018-09-22 23:22:13 100% Factory. All I did was give it some lemon oil and some love and fresh strings.. intonate change the action and the spring tension to accommodate my gauge of strings... closet queen!  lol
208 2018-09-22 23:22:02 I got cleansing oil in my eyes and I can now empathise with people who have cataracts.

211 2018-09-22 23:21:07 CBD oil helps
212 2018-09-22 23:21:03 Ah, on further reading, it seems that margarine is traditionally made with tallow, and since most brands want to be able to say they are suitable for vegetarians they changed to veg oil, so trading standards told them to stop calling it margarine. That's what I got anyway.
213 2018-09-22 23:21:00 Are we done talking about Kristen Bell vaping CBD oil yet?

Asking for a friend...
214 2018-09-22 23:20:52 I fucking hate how I told customers not to put oil on the fucking grill and then then dumb fucks put oil on the fucking grill. Rahj not my fault if oil drops into you shoots
215 2018-09-22 23:20:46 There's a woman waiting in line for coffee with a shirt that says "oil up buttercup"

There's an essential oils convention in town but that's beside the point
216 2018-09-22 23:20:23 For those of you with a standby generator right now: it’s important to turn off your generator every 24 hours and wait 2 minutes, then check the oil. If it’s within the safe zone, you can put your generator back on the Auto position   #OttawaOutage #generac #kohler
217 2018-09-22 23:20:19 I need to find a place that accepts Apple Pay and does oil changes because I don’t have my card  at the moment 
218 2018-09-22 23:20:10 I think one has oil n the other one doesn't
219 2018-09-22 23:20:06 Stop pissing motor oil, mate.
220 2018-09-22 23:20:02 Children need love and understand and time and 
oregano and some olive oil and 20 m/pound at 350.   
Children like some garlic bread on the side.
221 2018-09-22 23:20:01 I hope this is helpful: my fallback is always pasta + fridge foraging. Keep plenty of dried pasta, olive oil, and cheese in stock. Add any tomatoes, courgettes, red onion, ham, pesto, capers etc which are available. Quantity scales easily, only need to boil pasta.
222 2018-09-22 23:19:35 Can you try CBD oil to rub on it?
223 2018-09-22 23:19:28 good luck my g
224 2018-09-22 23:19:25 I like onions cause they're the only thing that makes you cry that you can immediately throw in burning oil

227 2018-09-22 23:18:25 .... yes,  maybe I should oil my tits up now!
228 2018-09-22 23:18:24 pretty sure my neighbor with an 80s corolla has never added oil to it. that engine sounds sad
229 2018-09-22 23:18:23 A lubricating product is necessary all over the place, anyone knows that.  So mr oil man, can you repair the damage done to Earth by burning oil?  It's simple: we can no longer use the atmosphere as a garbage dump.  Can't be done.  Think about life.
230 2018-09-22 23:18:15 Interesting. I borrowed a neighbor's pressure washer to clean the moss and oil stains off my driveway, only to discover that actually my driveway appears to be CONSTRUCTED of moss and oil stains. #WesternOregonProblems
231 2018-09-22 23:18:12 Retweet this so someone’s daughter will remember to get her oil changed
232 2018-09-22 23:18:04 Not to mention, you guys can't fight. You couldn't even deal with Houthi's in Yemen. Iran would eat you alive. Saudi Arabia is quickly becoming an unnecessary problem. When the oil runs out, so does our tolerance and your value. Nobody needs you, camel jockey.

238 2018-09-22 23:17:31 Exactly.
If you own the banks and the oil, you will never loose any money. Banks got money for 8 years from the Fed @ 0% interest, My credit card, 22% interest if I pay on time. 
Car loans and mortgages we're never at 2% if I'm not mistaken.
They get the money for nothing.
239 2018-09-22 23:17:27 If you think everyone wants ur oil might wanna look in the direction of Elon musk.. if he succeeds with Tesla your country is doomed.
240 2018-09-22 23:17:14 For sure oil made the town.

243 2018-09-22 23:16:47 Saudi is part of Afrika. They have oil.
244 2018-09-22 23:16:26 Inspiration

I made my first flat bread tonight. What happened was, when I saw the bit of yellow oil on my sheet pan, I next saw the wheat flour I had in my fridge + I had a pitcher of iced water already out. 

A few motions, a rollout and pricked, I made my namesake: patty cake.

249 2018-09-22 23:15:51 All shined up like when u put oil all over ur big titties!
250 2018-09-22 23:15:32 Anything can happen with oil over the next few months. There will be pullbacks for sure. The question is from what level ?
251 2018-09-22 23:15:24 Oil will not be needed soon with companies like Tesla. America is one of the leading country’s in eco friendly energy. The question is when will ur oil run dry? If you don’t exhaust all of the oil by 2045 ur county’s gonna be in deep shit.
252 2018-09-22 23:15:14 I was busy forming I won’t join this baking your facing trend..well guess who had to learn her lesson after having oil seep through her makeup for the 100th time ..I swear my face is so oily the USA might just invade it
253 2018-09-22 23:15:01 According to an OPEC report, your oil reserves are a lot less than estimated. Saudi Arabia WILL BE OUT OF OIL within 30 years. You have no industry to fall back on. Canada and Venezuela have larger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia. Continued..
254 2018-09-22 23:15:01 Somebody come oil my scalp
255 2018-09-22 23:14:51 Those self-serving ones like Zinke who think that the government should be controlled by big gas and oil industry are controlled by them as well, dependent on their money kick backs...otherwise they wouldn't be singing that song.
256 2018-09-22 23:14:46 Tsk, tsk... and when Obama shit down the energy sectors of gas coal and oil? Keystone pipeline?!

271 2018-09-22 23:13:10 Just saw your replies. Yeah Sears has that $20 oil change thing. That's really good. I just got an oil change an hour ago.
272 2018-09-22 23:13:01 Tomorrow I’ll be smoking an injected Beef Round Eye rubbed down with ground garlic and other spices and braised with a garlic infused olive oil. Chicken Breasts marinaded in a Baja Citrus Blend including jalapeño infused olive oil and a pineapple balsamic blend.
273 2018-09-22 23:12:14 you ever look at your black outfit, opening ceremony tote, $80 cbd oil and raging cynicism and just think, “my god I AM brooklyn”
274 2018-09-22 23:12:01 Untuk heating system, plant korang pakai heating system apa? Steam? Hot oil? Hot water?

Rarely jumpa yang guna electrical heater coz it's not that cost effective, lagi lagi kalau high temperature diperlukan
275 2018-09-22 23:11:45 No, Ari.  It’s because that’s the job of the Judiciary Committee members.  Having a female mouthpiece doesn’t let them oil out of their duty, their responsibility.
It. Is. THEIR. Job.
But then you know that, don’t you Ari?

281 2018-09-22 23:10:48 Hmm well let’s say that ur oil is magic and it is infinite. At some point companies like Tesla will make the world a place that is run on completely eco friendly energy and Electricity will be a lot cheaper at that point. I’m not religious but I do respect your views:

288 2018-09-22 23:09:58 If I had a dollar for everytime a random white person told me I look like Maui from Moana, I'd have way more weed and oil in my jars!
289 2018-09-22 23:09:57 Ice on your neck, some peppermint essential oil and a dark room.
290 2018-09-22 23:09:55 Oh and another thing: Why every man that appreciates natural hair gotta have seashells around his neck, smelling like patchouli oil and rocking Jesus sandals? Can we dead that tired ass narrative right the hell now? #nappilyeverafter
291 2018-09-22 23:09:39 Even with the oil revenue you spend more than get in even Sturgen admits that now
292 2018-09-22 23:09:26 On another heavenly note. 
Finally bought a diffuser for my oil scents.. And now the whole place smells like lemons!
293 2018-09-22 23:09:18 What a productive day! 

Oil change 
Gym 
Visit with Gma
Cleaned the Whole house 

Time to relax
294 2018-09-22 23:08:54 I use olive oil for everything I cook - and my HDL (good cholesterol) is 101! 
295 2018-09-22 23:08:42 Amazon does get up my nose but I get spices at half the price of Tesco; stones at £30 less than half a mile away; Bark - same stuff from Wickes 0.13 per litre I pay 0.101 per litre; Saffron at 50% of Tesco prices - same for TeaTree Oil.
296 2018-09-22 23:08:26 Im outside putting more coolant in my car and checking my oil, this older guy pulls up and starts watching me and asking me if I know what I’m doing. I’m just like “ yeah I’m good “ , he continues to watch me and go “ oh shit maybe you do know what you doing “

299 2018-09-22 23:06:58 @WyrmwoodGaming do you suggest using wood oil on the wood part of the gaming dice trays and if you do what kind?
300 2018-09-22 23:06:56 "a division of American Home Products, helped precipitate a public health crisis, then peddled deadly snake oil to resolve it. Meanwhile, the government agency that should have been guarding the public interest stood idly by."

302 2018-09-22 23:06:48 I read the article and it said that the blubber of the creature tasted like almond oil. 
So in other words, the creature was a snack
303 2018-09-22 23:06:37 MT @Mikebattuello #CitizensUnited is the reason #Congress rarely does what we the people want. Companies, industries, organizations & super wealthy BUY #politicians & in turn demands are met. #NRA pays=no gun laws.
#Oil pays=squash solar. #Koch Bros pay=big tax cut.THIS MUST END.
304 2018-09-22 23:06:24 Let's see what I said to get rank pulled on me by the smart guys Your turf is how much most Americans struggle to pay their bills? Fair enough, mine neither. I'm just making the point that there is a disconnect here. But like you said, I should stick to oil and gas.
305 2018-09-22 23:06:19 .@dbot6000 #pitch The Odyssey in North Dakota oil boom country.
306 2018-09-22 23:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
307 2018-09-22 23:05:44 No red sauce for lunch.  Oil and garlic
308 2018-09-22 23:05:38 Exactly like what we are seeing.Foreign funded anti Canadian oil prosperity extremists have completely overrun our Liberal and NDP party's .And the climate fraud cultists have infested the PMO. #cndpoli
309 2018-09-22 23:05:33 I have enough groundnut oil, I’ll bring for you when I’m coming to Lag. 
310 2018-09-22 23:04:51 Jesus balls I hope this isn’t Earth prime.
311 2018-09-22 23:04:43 No kidding! That was the most entertaining oil kings game in a LONG time. #LetsGoOilKings
312 2018-09-22 23:04:39 Yeah, take your vitamins! I take 5-htp, magnesium, vit D, B12 (1000mg), cod liver oil and melatonin at night. I add iron in once a month.

314 2018-09-22 23:04:00 I am Home When I Hear This, Smell This, A Haiku:

Olive oil, onions,
garlic, peppers. Salted, sweating

315 2018-09-22 23:03:41 The ‘toxification’ of Venezuela’s debt is certainly NOT a driver for the actual crisis. Even without the sanctions, the high levels of debt/GDP and low investment in the oil industry would’ve taken the country to the same result
316 2018-09-22 23:03:22 Made a bentonite clay, avocado, honey, vegetable glycerin, ACV, fresh aloe and coconut oil hair mask last night. It was messy AFFFF getting it all out but woke up looking like I just went to the salon like whaaaat!!!!..... 
#SelfCare
317 2018-09-22 23:03:12 Carb flu shouldn't be that bad. But chilling in bed with Netflix and bone broth is always a good idea. May I be so bold as to recommend coconut oil instead of olive.
318 2018-09-22 23:03:08 Cannot wait. Chiarelli kept his word and it took 3 years to get prospects from all walks to pro. Better coaching as well.
319 2018-09-22 23:03:04 Wasted land,
government should  take use of it,
huge barley farms, oil manufacturing etc...
320 2018-09-22 23:02:51 I feel like fish tonight but I ran out of oil 
321 2018-09-22 23:02:49 Why do you support Trump when you know he's a sexual predator, traitor, and wants to let oil, coal, and gas corporations pollute, poisoning and killing people and animals, and those fetuses you claim to care about?
322 2018-09-22 23:02:44 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
323 2018-09-22 23:02:29 Interesting when in war or fighting over oil we get where we need to be with ease and that's way further away. Who birthed these people?
324 2018-09-22 23:01:58 Lawn mower broke, router stopped working, truck needs an oil change, had to cop more tools for work, rent and bills are due. I’m straight up boxing life right now and I just took a right hook to the sweet spot.
325 2018-09-22 23:01:55 Thank you!!! That was my ex’s t point. There is a difference from in game teaching then throwing kids to the wolves. It will speed up development. Frazier would pull the other 4 on ice back prior to a face off and tell them what to do. On the bench he would talk to one at a time

327 2018-09-22 23:01:42 I cannot confirm it's the oil but after 1 does my mood seems to be a little better and I was fuckin around with the jeep and I'm not sore at all. I'll let you as I keep going

Just think all that great Scottish Water you can drink now D..no more limits eh> <3
333 2018-09-22 23:00:37 @SeanUnfiltered  Like Oil buried underneath the ground, an under current of emotion is rising.  Oiler nation is on its dawn. Houston will look to their History to find strength.  The old will teach the new and make the old new again. Oil always rises my friend! God Bless Texas!

336 2018-09-22 23:00:29 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Tax this money 50% and build the wall!
@realdonaldtrump
337 2018-09-22 23:00:04 Lord. She did not follow instructions like the 1st video. Adding that tea tree oil mix to her face made me nervous. Lool! Oh gosh.
338 2018-09-22 22:59:57 People ignore that Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Brunei, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein or Libya under Muammar Gaddafi were actually socialist states.

Their Govts own the oil. They have sovereign investment funds. They supply the needs of all their citizens.
339 2018-09-22 22:59:22 Gabons proven oil reserves in 1996.
340 2018-09-22 22:59:22 Norway (following Alberta's example, ironically) chose to create a wealth fund & keep taxes the same. They heavily taxed foreign oil companies & they didn't leave! They have low debt, great public services, & a wealth fund that is the envy of the world.
Which approach works?

341 2018-09-22 22:59:08 Don't worry your boy Trudeau has sold out to big oil like Harper.
342 2018-09-22 22:59:05 When you take your car to the mechanic and treat her well. And now she wanna be thirsty and need oil. <<<<
343 2018-09-22 22:58:56 Except they didn’t “lose control” of them, they just let them do it so they could push thru the Patriot Act & gain control of oil via war, as always.
344 2018-09-22 22:58:55 Sorry, mate. I like your oil supply analysis, but this is my turf 
345 2018-09-22 22:58:47 My leftover general tso chicken wasn't spicy enough so I reheated it in hot chili oil and now my mouth is on fire. Perfect.

349 2018-09-22 22:58:03 @StephenAtHome I saw Tiffany Haddish advise you on your beard; I use beard oil from Jack Black. You probably know him
350 2018-09-22 22:57:53 Absolutely Pev, and his economic advisors are garbage. Peter Navarro is one of the worst, we ran him out of San Diego years ago. Also Trump is very much beholding to bigly oil in bigly ways. That's why he's gone directly against the solar industry and electric vehicles. Prick.
351 2018-09-22 22:57:46 lol tell them to read how many calories oil gives you 
352 2018-09-22 22:57:39 September Saturday night twitter reeks of pumpkin spice beard oil, Schlitz burps and singed leg hair bc you can't light a fire pit for shit, Chad.
353 2018-09-22 22:57:35 Global oil producers & in US shud tell Trump to go to hell. The "we protect OPEC countries in ME" is bogus. From whom? Notion without US global occupation Russian or Chinese wud move in foolish. Less than 5 FOBs between them, hardly the mark of countries with intent of invading.
354 2018-09-22 22:56:59 The oil industry undertook a long-term propaganda effort to make Albertans think that their interests and oil company interests are perfectly aligned. It worked. Trouble is, oil companies serve their shareholders, not Albertans.
355 2018-09-22 22:56:49 The same Ottawa accepts oil from same Saudi Arabia.  In the meantime drags it ass on pipeline approvals.
356 2018-09-22 22:56:30 No problem at all. My main rec will be doing jojoba oil to actually combat the overproduction! I’ve learned that my skin was oily to compensate for not having ENOUGH oil generally, so wearing it at night and letting your skin absorb helps the excess oil production die down a lot
357 2018-09-22 22:56:09 Boggles the mind that it's taken "modern society" almost 150years approx since the harnessing of #electricity, discovery of oil, & more, to figure out that the Sun is THE source of sustainable #cleanenergy. It can also make fire with a magnifying glass.
358 2018-09-22 22:56:02 Our Roman law is no doubt older than the rUK’s (probably one of Pontius Pilates bodyguard’s was the forerunner of all law!). Can’t we just sue them for all the oil money, for the 300 years they kept us back & be the great country we could, should & will be!
359 2018-09-22 22:56:02 Loool this is soo true They be like its vegetable oil there's nothing wrong with it infact its healthy
360 2018-09-22 22:55:48 I bought myself an essential oil defuser bc I deserve that shit after the week I’ve had
361 2018-09-22 22:55:36 except raw coconut oil that stuff can clog my pores.

363 2018-09-22 22:55:28 Those who have protested this pipeline likely have no idea that train is moving the same oil but at a greater risk of an accident.
364 2018-09-22 22:55:04 All they want is the grievance. Grievance to sow the seeds of division. Yesterday it might've been oil, today it's Brexit, tomorrow it will be something else.
365 2018-09-22 22:54:28 Proper respect for proper reasons. Back when our soldiers were sent to die for the freedom of all rather than oil or the wealth of the elite.
366 2018-09-22 22:54:15 Total bullshit! WE are their 3rd biggest contributor. WE prop us poorer EU countries. They didn't even let us join until N.Sea oil was found & have systematically asset stripped us ever since. The list is endless to the damage they've done to our country.
367 2018-09-22 22:53:56 Is the canola oil shipped by pipeline or railway?
368 2018-09-22 22:53:54 @ikamalhaasan said about teaching children bad things why on earth he spoke about Tasmac.  the problem is you only ask things to Aish and insult her. Viji did chilli oil,Rithu asked her to come for a fight, why no question to them. Complete nonsense and you call yourself a leader

372 2018-09-22 22:53:48 wash morning and night, salicylic acid during the day, i alternate glycolic acid and a mild retinol (the ordinary has a good one) at night but i dont use them every night. Then I use a face oil I make out of hemp seed, castor oil, and something called calophyllum inuphyllum
373 2018-09-22 22:53:41 Alberta has this idea they are free enterprise in all that they do. Fact is their main industry is fully subsidized... 

And that's just the way their big oil overlords like it...
374 2018-09-22 22:53:40 Sugar is crack for cancer. Sadly I'm a cake junkie, so am rewarding myself every three rounds with a slice of excellent quality cake from a bakery. Mouth has neuropathy at the moment, and in using coconut oil to beat that back...
375 2018-09-22 22:53:33 Sjsjsksn to consummate the marriage I have to get tub of coconut oil
376 2018-09-22 22:53:31 Picked the same one up few years ago at Outdoor farm show for $100.  Beats the ole princess auto one.  Grease and oil, Cheap insurance!!
377 2018-09-22 22:53:16 I like to compare the UK and Norway. They both tapped the same oil field but chose different ways to manage them.  We just have to look at the situation in each country to see which was the wiser choice.

393 2018-09-22 22:51:04 IT must be stopped at all costs for our children and future generations who deserve clean air water and land. We have enough oil we do not need to expand this TOXIC mess.

401 2018-09-22 22:49:35 It's hotter than a lava pit in the middle of the Mojave Desert that got transported to Hell and then got lit on fire by the devil himself and then bombed a million times by the U.S because oil was discovered there... at Anaheim
402 2018-09-22 22:49:32 Took photos of sackcloth and ashes, and I am eating bread and oil.
403 2018-09-22 22:49:24 The local shop has just got in a load of imported drinks from America, and honestly I dunno how you folks drink the stuff, high fructose corn syrup is like guzzling vegetable oil from the bottle, and "cherry and vanilla" Dr Pepper just tastes like Dr Pepper but costs an extra £1.
404 2018-09-22 22:49:19 Oh badass! Ima be in the oil fields hopefully soon, we need to link up!

406 2018-09-22 22:49:05 Precisely.  Anyone with an ounce of common sense knew cigarettes were killers long before big tobacco was forced to admit it.  Same here.  Anyone who was awake knew the problems with fossil fuels even before these Big Oil "top secret" reports were being put together.

412 2018-09-22 22:46:11 Unless you worked in steel, coal, oil, or manufacturing. Then they really just wanted your vote as your job went overseas. Too bad, sucker- Obama doesn’t have the magic wand to bring that back.

415 2018-09-22 22:45:45 Complete BS - all pipelines leak! How about using Solar and Wind power instead of toxic crude oil?
416 2018-09-22 22:45:34 Because if only more money were in the hands of oil company stockholders then that would be so much better than money circulating through the local economies of Alaska? Rentierism is not productive, Ned.
417 2018-09-22 22:45:31 I made a pretty good batch of tuna earlier (: it was:

A can of tuna
An avocado, mashed up with a splash of milk to make it smooth
A spoon of sesame oil (REALLY made the flavor)
A splash of salsa

I think next time I might add a little taco seasoning but its goooood

420 2018-09-22 22:44:47 With the way Man United is going down, they will soon discover crude oil. 

421 2018-09-22 22:44:28 suddenly he's an expert. trying to divert attention again on the prices of rice and food. you know the more it soars, the more taxes the govt gets from it, why don't you remove the taxes on oil then to reduce the impact. you're just playing for your dds your blind followers.
422 2018-09-22 22:44:23 Yess ma'am  gotta put some oil in then on our way out ! Lol
423 2018-09-22 22:44:21 mom: we need to take waffles to get oil changed
424 2018-09-22 22:44:00 My poor coconut oil has been going from solid to liquid, every other day. Toronto weather is just confused.
425 2018-09-22 22:43:49 I'll tell ya who doesn't need a bail out. The rich, corporations including Big Banks, Big Oil, and of course Big Phama. WTH is wrong with the rightwing? They'd ask for tax dollars to bail out the NRA, friggin' arseholes that they are.
426 2018-09-22 22:43:43 Sorry to be dense but WTF is #AMER? Impossible to decipher all of these internet acronyms even when I go to the #AMER feed. 

Historically, no one makes more $ when oil price go up b/c cost of services go up faster. Celebrate whatever #AMER is fast!
427 2018-09-22 22:43:26 i love the scent of rosemary oil ahh
428 2018-09-22 22:43:25 When you go to get just an oil change and then a crap ton is all due for service so it goes from 75$ to $210
429 2018-09-22 22:43:19 Standard Oil but for Alabama football
430 2018-09-22 22:43:15 It is incriminating to anyone who thinks a snake oil salesman is preaching race relations in a case where race is totally irrelevant. Blaming “white police officers” for the one woman responsible is huge problem in 2018.
431 2018-09-22 22:43:05 I hate to think I’m a conspiracy theorist, but I knew they knew. I also believe oil and gas companies have thwarted the production of electric car capabilities.
432 2018-09-22 22:42:59 Jaja ese no vuelve a mancharse con gas oil en su puta vida. La onda es hacerse el político y boyar los años que le quedan, no es tonto
433 2018-09-22 22:42:57 Why do you think we are paying attention to the new prince going around arresting everyone? Because we knew about the problems and spoke up but the right thought we were only concerned with oil. Why do you think we post about things like pussy riot in Russia?
434 2018-09-22 22:42:52 ... what in the world?! What you pointed out is minute compared to the millions of owners who are going electric each year. The annual EV sales will reach 10+ million by 2022, and with all-electric autonomous fleets that increase usage by 10x, this will mark peak oil demand.
435 2018-09-22 22:42:44 It’s not exactly true that he gets nothing from his dependents ssi money. It pays rent and pays for groceries and for heating oil in winter he benefits from all that
436 2018-09-22 22:42:41 RT @OptimusGrind__: Idk who daughter needs to see this, but get a oil change.

441 2018-09-22 22:41:43 A6 shower or use a cleanser to take off any sweat or oil off and apply a light moisturizer #WalmartWellness #p1400 #ad
442 2018-09-22 22:41:41 Just found out my castor oil pomade is actually for men and now it makes so much sense why my eyes roll back when I smell it
443 2018-09-22 22:41:34 Nationalization of a resource like oil does not necessarily ruin economies. Have you looked at Norway lately? There’s probably so much else going on overt and covert.
444 2018-09-22 22:41:31 Who is the luvvy wittering on about fracking being a “toxic” industry on @RT_sputnik? #fracking #oil #coal #gas
445 2018-09-22 22:41:08 Ok got a couple more desk decorations, 3 more pumpkin candles, and a mug. Also supplies to do an oil painting, a shark costume for my cats, and Halloween candy and oreos for a party  #fallhaul
446 2018-09-22 22:41:06 He reminds me of nothing more than a used snake oil salesman, full of smarminess.
447 2018-09-22 22:41:03 Como eu queria ir na Rio Oil & gas.
448 2018-09-22 22:40:50 Make tweets not oil
449 2018-09-22 22:40:39 I love sesame oil so much
450 2018-09-22 22:40:29 Also why don’t people put pics of themselves as their avatar?
I’m no oil painting but that’s really me now I want to see your faces

454 2018-09-22 22:40:04 When you’re frying food you need a lot of oil and for it to be hot. If not it’s just gonna be an oily mess especially tostones
455 2018-09-22 22:39:57 God bless try cbd oil I've heard such great stories to his alternative vs chemo
456 2018-09-22 22:39:45 Do I need an essential oil diffuser or am I just bored?
457 2018-09-22 22:39:45 Yep.  Urban Meyer is a joke.  Guiity of whatever he was accused
458 2018-09-22 22:39:35 A good cleansing and moisturizing  routine, regularly exfoliating and I also use rosehip oil along with my moisturiser for a lovely natural skin
459 2018-09-22 22:39:20 Then there’s “ultrabland” which is like a balm. You rub it all over dry skin to break up dirt, oil and makeup pigments and then used a warm damn cloth to wipe it all away. It’s taken off a full face of makeup for me.
460 2018-09-22 22:39:19 I thought you were Sherlock yet your denser than an oil . //
461 2018-09-22 22:39:18 We don’t have to guide fossil fuel brains to #EV or @Tesla ! Let them in their swamp full of oil! @Tesla never comes to anyone! Every body comes to @Tesla
462 2018-09-22 22:38:03 Has anyone used castor oil before?? How is it?
463 2018-09-22 22:38:03 Riches like oil, minerals, etc
464 2018-09-22 22:38:01 Olive oil

466 2018-09-22 22:37:58 There's no 'jewish lobby', and no 'Israel lobby'.  The US oil and arms industries are organising the spread of lies & smears against Corbyn.  They need to avoid the election of a socialist & pro-Palestine govt in the UK, & use Israel for that end.
467 2018-09-22 22:37:50 Easy to say when you’re backed by $16 million in oil money.
468 2018-09-22 22:37:46 Urban Meyer is scum.
469 2018-09-22 22:37:45 Sweet almond oil and Oyin’s honey water
470 2018-09-22 22:37:39 Yeesh! I pay $15.64/g (incl. taxes) for 18:0 thc oil, here in Sask. Brutal!
471 2018-09-22 22:37:38 car shopping so hard ‘ I be checking the engine ‘ oil ‘ motor and everything.
472 2018-09-22 22:37:32 Gordon's the man for delving deep into things that matter to progressives.  He is speaking truth to power, including Big Oil.  We need to stand Strong for that and start a Green Revolution.  I hope JC gets on with it since he is all right for 99.9% of everything else.
473 2018-09-22 22:37:25 It's in the constitution to put frying pan with oil in the oven of gas cooker 
474 2018-09-22 22:37:21 The rice, recharge card, garri, groundnut oil and brown envelope shared by Jonathan were for what? 

Infact, the menace has been reduced in this Osun election. You might disagree, no problem because we can only see what we want to see.
475 2018-09-22 22:37:07 In case anyone was wondering, vegetable oil works really well to get gorilla glue off your skin
476 2018-09-22 22:37:03 Other family members got Granny's old oil lamps. But I'm ok with that.
477 2018-09-22 22:36:58 Man I am about to see if I can hustle my cousins to change my oil cause I don’t wanna deal with these people at the shop. Tryna up sell me too. Just want an oil change dawg!
478 2018-09-22 22:36:40 I need some anointing oil.. I’m getting ready to slang it in the air and get these love bugs out here free from this spirit of lust!!!
479 2018-09-22 22:36:39 Bye bye odubel. Bye bye coconut oil
480 2018-09-22 22:36:37 Takes plenty of oil to mine & transport stuff that goes into batteries & components, lots of electricity from coal & natural gas to manufacture parts & lots of oil to transport cars across oceans & highways to consumers. 7500 batteries in Tesla! Think about it before celebrating.
481 2018-09-22 22:36:08 petrol is made from crude oil rihgt which is a fossil fuel and isnt fossil fuel basically dinosaurs
482 2018-09-22 22:35:49 As much as I defend coconut oil he should be held accountable with the circus performance
483 2018-09-22 22:35:48 Yes you can get vegan butter, like margarine, made from different plant oils or soy. You can also use just oil instead of butter e.g. coconut, olive or vegetable. Or put olive oil in the fridge & it hardens so you can use it like butter. It depends what you’re using it for really
484 2018-09-22 22:35:37 I have owned 3 cars over the last 10 years and today is my first real time i am going to get an oil change at a shop. I’ve been hustling my dad and brother all these years! I don’t wanna pay these people!
485 2018-09-22 22:35:31 Is it a double bottom oil hauler?
486 2018-09-22 22:35:26 I have a collar with a magnet in it that belonged to my old boy that you could have to see if it helps? I also tried a turmeric paste with coconut oil in it which might have helped if the old bugger would have eaten it!
487 2018-09-22 22:35:25 And to add to it, wait till the carbon tax kicks in and the tartiffs start if they let NAFTA lapse and the gas & oil industry tanks and the auto industry gets shafted and any other taxes, fees and incompetence the Liberals can think up! So many issues,such lack of leadership!
488 2018-09-22 22:35:19 おはようございます(*^^*)

492 2018-09-22 22:34:33 She was just hoping that Abe did that . He really lit the oil lamp and seen who she was and ran like hell
493 2018-09-22 22:34:30 i got this awesome hair oil from a native american natural remedy shop downtown, and now my hair is super healthy and soft.... BUT NOW I HAVE NO VOLUME AND MY HAIR DOESNT HAVE ITS NATURAL WAVES AND IM SAD... gonna get dreads i think.. maybe its time
494 2018-09-22 22:34:22 Avocado oil...(no it doesn't smell like avocados)
495 2018-09-22 22:34:16 They had no problem deploying a ton of soldiers to Afghanistan and Kuwait. But Puerto Rico’s a problem?? I’m guessing if they had oil refineries it would be a different situation
496 2018-09-22 22:33:59 Is truffle oil bad for you? I mean, if I put that stuff on all green salads, broccoli, patti pans and basically everything healthy and ate only that I’m pretty sure I’d have a super model body in about 2-4 weeks. IT TASTES SO DAMN GOOD. Also, I had it on pizza tonight 
497 2018-09-22 22:33:59 Did they do Coconut oil and pre tasted Ice Cream Day yet?
498 2018-09-22 22:33:53 Just put coconut oil on my eyebrows and eyelashes and everything is blurry I’m a fuckin idiot

500 2018-09-22 22:33:32 If it’s CBD oil it can’t get anyone high. this should be a no brainer.
501 2018-09-22 22:33:32 Never put olbas oil on a bed and then rub your eye, it may sting like a bit*h 
502 2018-09-22 22:33:17 Most especially engineers, we're the less regarded profession in Nigeria and most cheated
503 2018-09-22 22:33:07 I have never been poor and never will be poor. I don't see my fortunes improving under Trump. His will, if he can get the Russian sanctions removed and the Rosneft/ Exxonmoble oil merger takes place. Putin has promised Trump 25 billion.
504 2018-09-22 22:33:03 It taste like car engine oil on a hot summer day.
505 2018-09-22 22:33:02 How imma fry chicken with no oil 
506 2018-09-22 22:32:51 I don't think those numbers are correct Gal. Washington's HFT is one of the biggest factors for oil prices although it's harder to rig than Au & Ag which they are masters at.
507 2018-09-22 22:32:44 This is sad bro, use coconut oil
508 2018-09-22 22:32:12 If our rice industry can’t compete with imports then start encouraging farmers to industrialize their methods and grow different rice for export.  Grow Basmati and export to oil rich countries in the Mid East instead.
509 2018-09-22 22:32:11 All of my oil changes were performed by @P57VW and they destroyed my engine. Then they ruined my transmission while replacing the engine... with a used engine. #Palmetto57BadPractices #Volkswagen
510 2018-09-22 22:31:55 Oil change, car wash, and a full tank of gas. Cindy had a good day 
511 2018-09-22 22:31:53 You’re assuming the soybean supply is fixed. Not so. These tariffs will only incentivize Brazil and other countries to continue increasing oil seed production. US will become residual supplier.
512 2018-09-22 22:31:47 It's well documented that Venezuela's struggles are combination of an unsustainable reliance on oil prices, rigid implementation of price controls and the perfect implementation of socialist policy.

You could attempt intellectual economic debate without the subtle 'insults'.
513 2018-09-22 22:31:27 I was delighted to see everyone in the lobby of my oil change place reading books yesterday, and the young woman next to me was reading Why Not Me!
514 2018-09-22 22:31:18 I must look good today... I’m at the car shop and the mechanics really doing the fucking most about who’s going to help me can y’all please change my oil so I can go
515 2018-09-22 22:30:50 100% agree. Full electric car, running 500 miles without drop of oil is reality today!
516 2018-09-22 22:30:15 Forget people like this Oil no they there head jor
517 2018-09-22 22:30:11 Me using a hammer to get the oil cap off so I can add oil to my jeep is peak lesbianism
518 2018-09-22 22:30:02 I wish somebody could send me to rehab for cbd and I could just hide the oil and eat it in a relaxing environment.
519 2018-09-22 22:29:53 If #Biafra comes Barack Obama will loose his Nigeria Oil share which he has been using to finance Islam and  Isis.@realDonaldTrump . What's Obama interest in Nigeria?
520 2018-09-22 22:29:46 NPR is a hindrance.
521 2018-09-22 22:29:22 Oil you ready!?! Ok, sounds better in my head ...
522 2018-09-22 22:29:16 I did this thing AGAIN second visit in a row where the oil change guys ask to test my blinker and I TURN ON MY WIPERS 
523 2018-09-22 22:28:17 this peppermint oil is lifeeeeee, omg
524 2018-09-22 22:28:15 Very little. Just like we learned nothing from the oil crisis in the early 70s. And the last recession. And the great depression for that matter. We never learn anything - we just pretend it’s different now or that was different.

526 2018-09-22 22:28:02 食パンさんおはようございます！
527 2018-09-22 22:27:47 Strange how we persist in paying the entirely oil dependent kleptocracy the false honour of pretending they are more important and terrifying than the reality suggests.
528 2018-09-22 22:27:41 rump and his corrupt administration like handouts (welfare), but only for banks, oil companies, big pharma, corporations in general, and big agricultural conglomerates. 

And then, his cult followers nod and chant “lock her up.”
529 2018-09-22 22:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
530 2018-09-22 22:27:22 We have successfully created our premixed Jagua powder. It only takes 2.5 grams to make a oz of gel. Just add water and your favorite essential oil!
531 2018-09-22 22:27:00 You should resign and go back to being the opposition. We all know you’re against the oil industry, capitalism and free enterprise in general. You can’t even say “Alberta taxpayers” without puking in your own mouth. You’re a complete hypocrite.
532 2018-09-22 22:26:55 今日帰ったら周辺環境整えよう
533 2018-09-22 22:26:55 The #FallEquinox coming in with a bang. Had no issues solidifying all the coconut oil.
534 2018-09-22 22:26:52 I would do anything to provide my white king beto o rourke with one of those clean n clear oil absorbing sheets
535 2018-09-22 22:26:26 宏々さんおはありなのです！
536 2018-09-22 22:26:26 Cooking the vegetables in the leftover spam oil isn't considered healthy
537 2018-09-22 22:26:21 My olive oil cost more than the bottle of wine I bought
538 2018-09-22 22:26:21 British themselves wanted to divide the subcontinent in order to have a buffer state between India and Afghanistan and also to have a friendly nation to check their oil imports from newly discovered oil regions of Arab. Jinnah was just a puppet for them
539 2018-09-22 22:26:13 They just can't . They might want to do serious retaliation and stuff but they know that it will make things even worse
540 2018-09-22 22:26:05 Food grade hydrogen peroxide CBD oil
541 2018-09-22 22:25:44 Data becomes new oil. So far there are mostly illegal marketplaces where shady elements are trading private and public data of companies and individuals. But quite soon there will be legal data marketplaces. How well do you protect your data?
542 2018-09-22 22:25:25 If you don’t think oil is unethical and you are looking for a company with great cash flow and with a high dividend yield, than BP is what you are after. #britishpetroleum #BP #dividend
543 2018-09-22 22:25:18 寝落ちる前にみんなの描く全ディビ見てぇ……って欲望垂れ流して目を覚ましたら全原画揃ってたのでこれは魔法にかけられて……？？
544 2018-09-22 22:25:09 Remember the SGs and LGs take 48% of the oil revenue. Oil revenue = NNPC share of JVs less NNPC operational costs plus Pet.profit tax paid by oil coys. Just incorporate these into your calculations.
545 2018-09-22 22:25:06 When manufacturing in Ontario tanked, Albertans screamed "let it burn to the ground".  Now that they are feeling a pinch, they are begging for help. Hypocrisy runs as deep as an oil well.
546 2018-09-22 22:25:01 A branch of Eck-onomics, where oil could be said to be a bonus not a basis, when in reality it turned out to be the basis, and then it turns out to be £30bn short of forecasted figure.
547 2018-09-22 22:24:47 Salmon oil Steve, new lease of life in an old labs joints. 
548 2018-09-22 22:24:42 I learned that I could make my own juice with higher nicotine % in a non vegan juice. I’m allergic to soy & palm oil, so I went pure synthetic. I started smoking in ‘84. Life is wonderful not being a skate to nicotine...sells so much better, too
549 2018-09-22 22:24:39 I have anninting oil in my room
550 2018-09-22 22:24:28 Provide one concrete example of oil industry subsidy.
551 2018-09-22 22:24:16 I actually have my grand-maman’s old oil lamps all over the house and they are amazing for reading when there’s no power #geek
552 2018-09-22 22:24:10 Part of me wants to just leave school and go back to the oil field 
Puro 7/12s
Oilfield trash making Oilfield cash
553 2018-09-22 22:23:56 If this guy don’t hurry up and change my god damn oil I’m going to smack him with that pan
554 2018-09-22 22:23:45 Your the man John...well said...GM Klentak I believe a complete bust: pass on OFs: yellich, Cain; sign 1b when you are building team around Hoskins?...go into allstar break with 17+ blown saves and get no closer? Starters leaking oil, could have had hamels and Happ for 2 farmers.
555 2018-09-22 22:23:40 You know, there's nothing wrong with #ChuckGrassley that
a little 'neatsfoot' oil couldn't cure.

558 2018-09-22 22:23:17 If you have dark marks or hyperpigmentation on your face, go buy the 100% argan oil by Josie Maran from Sephora. It’s $45 for a tiny bottle (which is expensive to me) but I swearrrr it’s a #gamechanger

561 2018-09-22 22:22:53 yes i understand that Oil . Coal can be bartered and money is not always a necessity, 
but the world as in global trade needs the dollar.
I dont think we will ever have a global world currency, It just would never work, (see EU).

565 2018-09-22 22:22:13 This has a major effect on the wellbeing of the African countries’ economic prosperity, stripping their governments from any economic sovereignty, because of the loss of ruling over the oil.
566 2018-09-22 22:21:57 Because our "holy water" (oil and gas) is a leading contributor to it.  Denying it should make it go away, right?
567 2018-09-22 22:21:38 Yup, there’s lots more ... 1.1 million acres Alberta oil sands etc.

I don’t eat out much. Last restaurant was someone’s leaving do. “Don’t worry they’ll cook you something nice”. It was pasta with broccoli, garlic and oil. That’s it. Waited hours for food, so ate it.

574 2018-09-22 22:20:46 Rex Tillerson has a vested interest in oil, so put him in charge of the Middle East.

Jarad's dad is a corrupt businessman, but why bother with his background check her letting him negotiate with princes.

It failed repeatedly, and his access got pulled.
575 2018-09-22 22:20:34 Tonight's project: clean & re-new altar spaces, wipe all wood surfaces with oil soap, collect that last bits of garbage out of my bedroom!  Who-hoo!  Here's to a wonderful #Mabon <3! I hope that, by the full moon on the 25th, the laundry will be done as well.

577 2018-09-22 22:20:27 Uh oh, you’ve been brainwashed by Faux News. As a percentage, new jobs are growing at a slower rate. Higher wages? For who? Higher inflation, oil prices and tariff constraints tell the tale in people’s wallets. “Best in history”? Not even the best in the last 30 years. Or last 10
578 2018-09-22 22:20:13 my dad took my car to get the brakes done, an oil change and wash it... i guess fainting really does have some perks eh

590 2018-09-22 22:18:23 No baby, this is going to be good. Break out the old fashioned kernels and com them up in coconut oil! Finish with Himalayan pink salt and Amish butter. I've got some doozies to lay on you.

601 2018-09-22 22:17:10 @JustinTrudeau does not support Canadian oil and gas
602 2018-09-22 22:16:50 What's weird is the tweet that started this all is one of his least trolling tweets. And yes, he does troll Oil fans occasionally, but there is zero reason for a death threat. I'm embarrassed for the people that thought that was okay
603 2018-09-22 22:16:47 It was a major factor. Venezuela existed on oil. Nationalisation wrecks economies. Venezuela is planning to bring in private enterprises to run oil. Hallelujah.
604 2018-09-22 22:16:40 This is an opinion piece, not some government declaration for a set point on price of oil. The author reviews Trump’s tweets and claims that it looks like the president doesn’t like prices above $80. This doesn’t mean that there is a target set for the oil price at $80.

607 2018-09-22 22:16:26 Yeah and Trump would never be president, GDP could never go over 2% , Obamacare was here to stay, Manufacturing in US could never come back, we don’t have enough oil, etc.....
608 2018-09-22 22:16:26 Most reasonable thing I've read today in regards to oil.
609 2018-09-22 22:16:24 Please kind your status as a leading research institutions. Don’t fall for cheap stunt or marketing. Saturated fat is not a single entity. Coconut Oil has different constituents of fat. Understand it first then comment or propose otherwise.

612 2018-09-22 22:15:59 She wasn’t dealt a crap hand.  Started when she said we are the embarrassing cousins. Then, we’re not getting enough royalty. Found to be false. 2 years of slamming oil and 8 months “promoting” it. That’s reaching for crap.
613 2018-09-22 22:15:55 Blame the Cons for ruining every environmental protection and then closing Coast Guard stations in BC and stating an oil spill ramifications to BC can't be factored in. Whose economy is more important? AB or BC?

624 2018-09-22 22:14:04 it was basically tofu fried in a pan. but the yolk is made from a variety of spices with water, oil. the sauce tastes so good.
625 2018-09-22 22:14:00 I’m sure coconut oil and  boy wonder GM have loads of excuses.
626 2018-09-22 22:13:53 Dangote oil refinery will take care of all that. Hopefully lol

628 2018-09-22 22:13:52 I would pay a large sum of money to be able to dip myself into a vat of moisturizing oil at least once a week.
629 2018-09-22 22:13:39 I heard you went through a motor already for not having oil lmao
630 2018-09-22 22:13:17 Get regular oil (not synthetic) and consider high mileage oil if your car has over
75K miles, is older and/or if the engine "sounds louder" than it did in the past.
631 2018-09-22 22:13:16 And by long-run I mean in the next 50+ years...haha. If energy markets continue the way they are, and technology progresses there will be an eventual shift away from oil and even natural gas. Bad news for a country like Russia.

649 2018-09-22 22:10:05 And when you say we should move on from 2014 is that because you want us to forget all the lies Yes/SNP told everyone back in 2014? All the lies about EU membership, currency, oil revenue, and everything else?

656 2018-09-22 22:09:27 I see a man who is accomplishing more than I have seen ever before.  From trade wars to space wars to taxes and oil production I see changes and ideas.  I am evaluating results on an ongoing basis like I hope everyone else is.  So many years of Dem presidents and no real change.
657 2018-09-22 22:09:21 And Hal Puthoff is the one that worries me.  I think he's a snake oil salesman based on his past work with the CIA and remote viewing, Uri Geller, etc. 

But DeLonge takes Puthoff very seriously.  People should read up on Puthoff and make up their own minds.
658 2018-09-22 22:09:20 Dude, this a complete setup. You can smell it like the gas and oil leaking from Ted Kennedy’s Olds polluting the water as Mary Jo suffocated. The fish ain’t biting.

They are doing just fine.
664 2018-09-22 22:08:49 I changed the lightbulb of my car by myself. Next step is oil change. Eventually I’ll build a car on my own 
665 2018-09-22 22:08:30 The oil sands is where most of AB's capex has been directed. Unsustainably low personal tax-rates have not helped in the face of a global supply glut and oversupplied NA market.

677 2018-09-22 22:05:39 Well what I do is moisturize my face with coconut oil an hour or two before because tree trea oil can be harsh on the skin then I add the tea tree oil only on my acne scars and leave it for like 4 hours then take all that off with the witch hazel. Been helping me a lot
678 2018-09-22 22:05:27 "We stopped these" how can he be a proud Christian when his party is part of the reason these people flee? nations we bomb and invade because they have too much oil we want off the market or governments we don't like the colour of

702 2018-09-22 22:02:00 @ManOfHamsters ---your 70% represents the 80's when farm lands and oil rigs were private and owned by locals---oil industry and farm lands were nationalized, lands were taken away from its owners exactly what happened in the soviet communist regime. don't brainwash people
703 2018-09-22 22:01:48 @MissEllieMae # CONTINUED from Tweet One :
Greedy Speculators should turn their attention to Gold, Silver, Diamonds 
and Oil Paintings which Ordinary Working People do NOT NEED.
704 2018-09-22 22:01:44 I just got olbas oil in my eye and it burns even more than u would expect haha
705 2018-09-22 22:01:33 What about deforestation problem due to growing demand for avocado, palm tree oil etc?
706 2018-09-22 22:01:19 It’s actually fucking pathetic… the amount of times I actually delete a tweet Before sending,Because I know the snowflake on the other end will go ballistic is ridiculous
707 2018-09-22 22:01:12 Ill go one step further. If fishermen (for eg) owned the ocean in which they worked and had the right to protect it, he would never destroy the ecosystem. Oil companies could never pollute as failure would lead to bankruptcy, and the people using the waters would be compensated.
708 2018-09-22 22:01:09 どこのお店ですか？
709 2018-09-22 22:00:49 Normally if I have anything like 140/ At work I won’t even be allowed into the factory ....bed rest and monitoring ...that dude was lucky

711 2018-09-22 22:00:41 I love putting peppermint oil on my temples when I have a headache and then my eyes start burning begging me to take a nap but no i just keep going
712 2018-09-22 22:00:38 Or a fish might get chopped up in a water turbine. We’ve tried @johniadarola. Coal and oil it is! Drill baby Drill
713 2018-09-22 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
714 2018-09-22 22:00:20 Then put down your phone.  It's full of evil oil products.
715 2018-09-22 22:00:17 I remember when I started my perfume oil business, the first ten bottles were bought by my friends. They didn't need it at the time, they just wanted to support..... The little things that matter
716 2018-09-22 22:00:02 You have it backwards the US is the largest oil producer in the world.  The US takes Canada's oil refines it and sells it back.  The US is a net exporter of power to Canada.  It's to be nationalistic but at least make realistic threats like natural maple syrup.  That I would miss
717 2018-09-22 21:59:26 Eu recebi !! Ele ta lindo na foto. @ptbrasil
718 2018-09-22 21:59:25 Finally got an oil change and I'm the happiest girl ever lol

720 2018-09-22 21:59:14 Where can we get d palm oil?
721 2018-09-22 21:59:12 Check out carbon 60 (or c60) in olive oil topical use

723 2018-09-22 21:58:15 Baby oil ko 
724 2018-09-22 21:57:50 I got the message or whatever but let’s talk about when he rubbed the oil on her bald head and licked it off her neck.. 
725 2018-09-22 21:57:49 Kline and his Con team pissed away the Heritage fund & blamed cyclical oil downturn on Neglect by Ottawa. #WesternAlianation was created to justify their own mismanagement. Which it seems Kenney is chomping at the bit to repeat.
726 2018-09-22 21:57:38 I have my daily spiritual routine I do every morning.
I take my shower and wash myself with lavender, sea salt and other herbs.(which smells amazing) 
Then while moisturizing w/ coconut oil, I burn sage and smudge myself while getting dress. Then I take my daily vitamins.
727 2018-09-22 21:57:35 The Nigerian in me will make me stone am Ehn, 
After the raccoon fall I go put am fire and sprinkle anointing oil..
I go still do prayer and fasting then awaits calls from village
728 2018-09-22 21:57:33 ...but we do need to be mindful of incidents like the Love Canal and spills from Exxon Mobil and BP oil. I'm far from a tree hugging baby killer. I feel women should have a say over their own bodies when unfortunate situations occur.
729 2018-09-22 21:57:07 I know I’m no oil painting but this lot hit every branch when they fell out th eugly tree

731 2018-09-22 21:56:32 Another white lie. Your only there to get the oil. Now your toiling where you don't belong. Your gonna get spanked and your economy will feel it.  You'll get a "I told you so!!" Later.

733 2018-09-22 21:56:03 Like I got my oil changed before but for some reason I must’ve not payed attention. Regardless I blame Chevy cause the mf ain’t put the sticker up so I know when to change it!
734 2018-09-22 21:55:57 An american news organisation not blaming americas foreign policy on those that dont sell them oil?! Well colour me shocked.
735 2018-09-22 21:55:45 LONDON LABOUR in #Scotland  have shown themselves, repeatly, to  be opponents to #Scotland.

They took the Trillion out of our Oil Revenue and they spent the money.

200,000 from Every Scot and spent it on LONDON Vanity Projects.

We can't afford their friendship.
736 2018-09-22 21:55:36 We had another wonderful day today! We had 6 adoptions Timon, Diamond, Lucky, Olive Oil, Panda, and the amazing kitty Beetlejuice all found their forever homes!
737 2018-09-22 21:55:36 Don't know much about these, other than the 1,9 GT was 
a serious tool.

And that the Diesels further forged the iconic reputation 
of PSA's simple inline-four oil burners' indestructbility...
738 2018-09-22 21:55:33 I put 1 + 2 together and figured that’s what you meant. You’re going to have a good team to watch this year Rich. Enjoy! 
739 2018-09-22 21:55:33 I got my teeth cleaned and my oil changed on the same day a whole back so when my mom and pops find out how long it’s been since then they’ll be evenly disappointed in me and have something to bond over
740 2018-09-22 21:55:29 Mostly Americans! More tech than oil. And to think that any one of them could solve so many American problems single handedly, but they don’t. In fact, they don’t even pay their fair share in taxes. Underpay their own workers. Pfft.
741 2018-09-22 21:55:25 BOB from Twin Peaks. I snuck down from bed and saw him. In my nightmares he turned blue with a nose like Gonzo, but had the same unmistakable menace & motor oil slick. That was a recurring nm for years (w/ other stuff thrown in ofc)
742 2018-09-22 21:55:21 I have seen the oil sands ( mother nature’s biggest oil spill) but no I’ve never seen tar sands and oil rigs are just pieces of equipment that appear for a few days then are gone
743 2018-09-22 21:55:05 I used 2 parts ground beef to 1 part pork (key).  Add a good bit of grated Pecorino, some bread crumbs, 1 egg, bunch of crushed garlic, chopped parsley, salt, pepper.  Mix, roll out and fry in oil before adding sauce.  Have also used sausage in place of pork.
744 2018-09-22 21:55:01 You were saying?
745 2018-09-22 21:54:56 My damn oil need to be changed and my car sounded weird so I got out . Not going nowhere until somebody change the oil . Fuck this
746 2018-09-22 21:54:42 Water as populations increase sources of potable water decline which is why water  is more valuable than oil 
747 2018-09-22 21:54:25 C....can I oil your wood sometime....
748 2018-09-22 21:54:03 I need a reup on some rose hip oil! ASAP

750 2018-09-22 21:53:56 yeah a mixture of tumeric soy sauce and oil 
751 2018-09-22 21:53:50 Good news is got a working E Fag, Mrs had to get me a cheap packet of real fags on Thursday, £9, fuck me it costs me a £1 a week for oil for my fake fag. No difference what so ever, how long before the bastards tax it.

I am celebrating with meditation, my oil diffuser pumpin at the highest setting, a beautiful playlist, wine, and seafood.
756 2018-09-22 21:53:31 It's 3am in the morning you woke me up to refill the oil at the cargo pumps. All these 5 days f*cking long voyage you never asked me to do it. Bullshit chief
757 2018-09-22 21:53:30 Sha no bring palm oil come
758 2018-09-22 21:53:07 You'd be surprised how much supply there will be if oil turns sharply higher.
759 2018-09-22 21:53:06 Beto is such a positive, vibrant candidate! Cruz.....Um...same ol slimy snake oil salesman.

761 2018-09-22 21:52:58 We need the oil!! We are going to produce it and ship it anyway why is it better to ship it by rail??? Ask Lac Megantic?
762 2018-09-22 21:52:57 We were talking about fiscal management not capital. The so-called AB Advantage has done nothing for "capital". When oil prices began to plummet in mid-2014, capital went elsewhere (shale, etc.). As the OPEC chief noted a few days ago, a decline of $1T in investment.
763 2018-09-22 21:52:51 I’ll never get used to $140 oil change 
764 2018-09-22 21:52:43 last food items in the series of foods cause inflammation, arthritic patient should try to avoid: Trans fat oil, Omega 6 oil, vegetable oil.
765 2018-09-22 21:52:40 AJ put him in the palm oil good and proper at the end there
766 2018-09-22 21:52:38 "Let's see, well it's best to get deal with situation to settle down first then get boxes to pack my stuff." She mutter to herself. "Well.... That and I honestly had a odd feeling I need some truffles oil to cook tonight."
767 2018-09-22 21:52:32 Two different arguments. Vets in prominent roles vs supporting ones. You gotta bring these kids along with some mentoring like any other job. Bear, Jones, Lagesson etc can all benefit from having a  vet of 538 GP to work with. 

Real question is if that’s what he’s willing to do.
768 2018-09-22 21:52:20 Does anyone know if coconut oil vapors kill brain cells? Asking for a friend.

785 2018-09-22 21:49:40 If I'm gonna pay an extra 6 cents per litre I'd say rather it go back into our economy than into the pockets of oil execs.

787 2018-09-22 21:49:29 They are not pure socialist, they re nationalized their oil industry and have paid a steep price by the west in doing so, they are more centrally governed in an autocratic fashion than socialist and that photo is not Venezuela btw

790 2018-09-22 21:49:11 lol.  I pay close attention to tropical weather as it can shut in crude oil rigs, which impacts production, which impacts oil prices, which impacts propane prices, which impact my clients ;)
791 2018-09-22 21:49:07 In the 1980s, oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In 1982, for example, Exxon
792 2018-09-22 21:48:51 No way! I had a Volvo 340, (3rd car) constantly pouring oil into it. 2nd car, mini, so easy to maintain. Cars now, opening the bonnet is a futile attempt at finding the engine under a pile of plastic casing. You're driving a laptop, not using it for diagnostics.

815 2018-09-22 21:43:31 Fuel efficiency is also more impactful on fuel and oil demand b/c it impacts 100% of vehicle sold.
816 2018-09-22 21:42:34 if you put tequila in your kombucha does it still serve its purpose?  asking for a hungover friend...
817 2018-09-22 21:42:23 i have to moisturise my wrist every day before my tattoo so baby oil is now my new best friend.
818 2018-09-22 21:42:22 I have had allergies to this citric acid since they started putting it in everything. I’m also allergic to penicillin which I think is made from mold. I’ve written to oil of Olay to stop putting this in their body wash. I can use their bars because they don’t put it in that.
819 2018-09-22 21:41:54 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.

829 2018-09-22 21:41:12 I'm sorry. Other things you can try is peppermint essential oil, rub on your temples. Try a shower, sit down , lights off and let the water run off your head. 
Also a cooling pack on the neck

841 2018-09-22 21:39:51 Okay, keep the dogs, but just coat the geckos in CBD oil so the dogs will chill out after they eat the first one.

843 2018-09-22 21:39:37 In this new dark age, there's a surplus of information available to us, yet so few of us know how to use it correctly. Fake news, junk science and generic snake oil are obvious signs. From a cultural standpoint, we might as well be alchemists, trying to make gold from lead.
844 2018-09-22 21:39:36 Kaya mo yan!
845 2018-09-22 21:39:21 GMB offers to buy soya seed at that price for what ?
What's cheaper to extract oil from soya seed or from cotton seed? Whats the recovery of hexane per tonne of soya or cotton seed processed? 
What drives demand of soya seed production?
846 2018-09-22 21:39:07 And yet those same people who do not know about the oil companies, could probably who won the first season of 'The Apprentice'...
847 2018-09-22 21:38:59 何だかスキルアップできそうなプログラムですね！

uuumにとってもRTAって新しい分野だから認められたんすかね？

何にしてもおめでとうございます！
848 2018-09-22 21:38:31 Just imagine this scenario: 

Republicans keep the House and Senate in Nov, even picking up more seats in the Senate. 

Mueller ends probe & finds no collusion. 

Another SCOTUS seat opens up and Trump gets to fill. 

Liberal heads EXPLODE nationwide! 


849 2018-09-22 21:38:30 Eddies cooking bacon and every 5 min I hear him "Ow fucking oil!" 
850 2018-09-22 21:37:45 's economy is still managing to grow, despite the warhas waged there. 

went from the second largest global economy as the USSR, to a GDP smaller than New York State. 

has managed to do better than, without oil propping up its entire economy.
851 2018-09-22 21:37:45 @Castro4Congress Am a former writer for Ann Richards, Garry Mauro, and U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Let me know if you would like a little assistance at any time. I will donate my work to help you get elected. Born in Dallas, am a fifth-generation Texan. A lot of experience in oil
852 2018-09-22 21:37:41 Cold cucumber slices on you eyes.  Also try peppermint oil on your temples.
853 2018-09-22 21:37:33 I never knew there was a fort under the oil refinery. #Dartmouth #Archaeology
854 2018-09-22 21:37:19 There are huge industries, especially oil, with a stake in it. They conspire, lie, lobby, brainwash and bribe to eliminate any alternatives.
855 2018-09-22 21:37:09 Girl. Honestly it’s a work in progress. I’ve tried oil, which actually makes it worse, the itching is so bad sometimes. I let myself get dehydrated it pops up, is the water in the area is too hard, here we go again. I just let it run its course. And I take zinc supplements
856 2018-09-22 21:37:05 i used coconut oil when i was pregnant with my son & i didn’t get any new stretch marks. i has some on my butt & thighs before i was pregnant! 
857 2018-09-22 21:37:01 services are becoming important again as all other security bullshits are sligjtly different flavors of snake oil, snort, suricata and poorly glued together web front ends and mysql dbs.
858 2018-09-22 21:36:47 US has oil reserves to last for longer than any country in case of oil deficit. Making money and profit aside they really are selfishly working to build their country.  Speak to anybody - their patriotism shows. That’s their design. Americans are born with a capitalist flavor.
859 2018-09-22 21:36:43 Been on this same oil for 8 days
860 2018-09-22 21:36:15 MacGyver would fix this with a fence post, twenty barrels of crude oil and a heroic quantity of duct tape.
861 2018-09-22 21:36:12 Any flight I've been in, they do this. My brand new suitcase was covered  in dirt and oil on a flight from Houston to Ny on United. That was the last time I checked my bags in.
862 2018-09-22 21:36:11 Hm, I guess I would have noticed that as I live in Austria. 
Plus, omv has switched from cheese to oil n gas???
863 2018-09-22 21:36:08 wash just gave me some cbd oil for hangovers and holy shit, I feel good now!
864 2018-09-22 21:36:01 Venezuala is a capitalist country with socialized oil reserves, like Alaska.
865 2018-09-22 21:35:57 Lucky you, I have slow metabolism I can't eat like that. Sure I can eat it once a week, but I have to be careful with my calories/fat/carbohydrates consumption. Funny thing, eating healthy is delicious. Chicken breasts cooked in olive oil with salad and baked potatoes? Yum.
866 2018-09-22 21:35:57 Hopefully, I suppose
867 2018-09-22 21:35:43 CBD oil and I second the glucosamine.

870 2018-09-22 21:35:28 It's a business. Change your oil when you need it
871 2018-09-22 21:35:25 Someone let me know why my last synthetic oil change was 65$ and this one was 45$ at the same place 
872 2018-09-22 21:35:22 What are you going to do without or water and electricity and engineering skills?
Then there is all the Scottish produce you been stealing and the oil revenue. How are you going manage you greet when ye get a wee drap snaw on your shoes.
873 2018-09-22 21:35:15 Simple , lemon juice.  Vitamin e oil and witch hazel does wonderful
874 2018-09-22 21:35:10 True but in fairness Regimes of #FUKUS, EU/Turkey/Israel/Saudi/Qatar want an excuse to raze Damascus. Libya 2 is what they hope for. Then just clear the dead bodies as #BorisJohnson would say and make way for the oil companies etc
875 2018-09-22 21:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this September? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
876 2018-09-22 21:35:00 Does the government think that if they do something to eliminate the dependence on foreign oil that us underlings will have too much jingle in our pockets?

878 2018-09-22 21:34:34 Keep fighting!
879 2018-09-22 21:34:24 Got an oil change at 8:30am, sewed most of a ribbon skirt, went to Scholar's Choice to pick some stuff up, then cooked dad supper. God damn, who am I and where did I even come from?
880 2018-09-22 21:34:04 As if oil is all we got?
881 2018-09-22 21:33:59 The oil belongs to the #Venezuela people - but at present only the #Maduro narco mafia and its corrupt allies like #Cuba and China get any benefit from the oil - the starving masses get nothing! This will not be a military invasion - it will be a lawful arrest of narco criminals!
882 2018-09-22 21:33:51 Nick gma said she taking cbd oil and I just imagined her saying she’s tweekin tweekin off that 2cb
883 2018-09-22 21:33:40 CBD oil from Rick Simpson if you can get it. Otherwise find a good quality pure oil, but it has to be CBD. I bought some for my friend with cancer in her entire digestive tract and asked her to stay with it. She did and now cancer free.
884 2018-09-22 21:33:35 Could be that you need an oil change
885 2018-09-22 21:33:27 Will definitely try the head & scalp , just oil my scalp and massage it , already relaxes me .
This is great ! Good to see you again sis 
886 2018-09-22 21:33:12 Awesome!!! Send us a DM with your email and we’ll get you started!
887 2018-09-22 21:32:39 Like the rest of us are supposed to feel sorry for them because they struck oil first. What a greedy lot.
888 2018-09-22 21:32:34 Went to go get an oil change and I watched the guy almost give my car to someone else by mistake. I guess that shows how much I really don't give a fuck today.
889 2018-09-22 21:32:31 A pool w an oil slick.
890 2018-09-22 21:32:30 They have no shame or guilt either about what they do just for oil
891 2018-09-22 21:32:22 Looks great Shaun. I would oil it at least. Just to protect it from getting ruined by something like wine. 
892 2018-09-22 21:32:19 wow i really need to change my oil
893 2018-09-22 21:32:15 Well, they consider human babies in the womb as “not people” or “parasites”, think the activity of the sun has no bearing on temperatures, and they think people with penises are women. So...... yes.
894 2018-09-22 21:32:09 You’re trash you ugly ass nigga when you look in the mirror your reflection walks away and when you go swimming the lifeguard thinks there’s a oil spill
895 2018-09-22 21:32:07 Half bacon grease half sunflower oil. It’s divine. Highly recommend.
896 2018-09-22 21:32:03 For $20 I’ll say “don’t you have an oil for that?” To the next table that complains
897 2018-09-22 21:31:33 Put vitamin E oil on it with cocoa butter from the actual stick
898 2018-09-22 21:31:28 So my fibro has been the worst it's ever been. Currently using CBD oil rub to help with pain along with my multiple prescriptions (opioids included). I'm very glad to have found this space and hope we can help each other and ourselves #Nightingales
899 2018-09-22 21:31:16 We need a Manhattan Project sized geoengineering to save Humanity.  It must be started and we must accelerate decarbonization with Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas. We need long term ( for centuries possibly.) solar blocking that is space based and with redundancy.

904 2018-09-22 21:30:46 I need to go get a oil change 
905 2018-09-22 21:30:38 Reply 7/n: Instead of dissipating their energy on Iran( no angel of course), US, UK , France must tell Saudis in non-nonsense terms to stop funding of Salafi Jihadi ideology globally - most Islamic terrorists come from that. Peace is more important than enough oil for racing car.
906 2018-09-22 21:30:33 Oil change time. Not realizing it was long over due, well about 100 miles.
907 2018-09-22 21:30:29 2015. This link has 75,000 miles of land for oil. I wonder if it's part of the land stolen by poppy bush on 911?
908 2018-09-22 21:30:29 @Gidi_Traffic Suspected Pirates have kidnapped 12 people from a Swiss merchant vessel off the coast of Nigeria.The Ship was carrying wheat between Lagos and the southern Niger Delta oil hub of Port Harcourt when it was attacked around 45 nautical miles south west of Bonny Island

910 2018-09-22 21:30:26 I've heard for years that the government is going to investigate the oil companies for price gouging and fixing. WELL?
911 2018-09-22 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
912 2018-09-22 21:30:09 Other than his snake oil pills? He attacked grieving families of a mass shooting and other crazy things. You can’t say these outrageously inflammatory remarks and not expect to have backlash.
913 2018-09-22 21:30:07 May Allah see us through, when I look at my life like 5-8pm daily, come back tired, d only break is going fr salat , then weekends n leave , so what's there to enjoy a rayuwar idan baka komaga Allah ba

915 2018-09-22 21:29:47 Allow me to be among the first to offer gasoline, fuel oil, fissionable material, or sails -- whichever she wants.
916 2018-09-22 21:29:37 Just because its cannabis based doesn't mean it has properties like THC that will get you high. CBD oil from hemp is non psychoactive and is known to treat many conditions including but not limited to epilepsy.People often overreact when they hear cannabis!
917 2018-09-22 21:29:12 Today’s the day I decided to finally be an adult and get a damn oil change.
918 2018-09-22 21:29:04 Tea tree oil and witch hazel works wonders baby
919 2018-09-22 21:29:01 The Oil companies that drill the oil aren’t running charities. I wonder if under-recovery affects this.
920 2018-09-22 21:28:48 cheering for danaerys in game of thrones is like cheering for oil barons irl. like how can she lose anything to anyone, she has 3 full grown dragons. zzz resident sleeper, boring character, overpowered.
921 2018-09-22 21:28:46 Ducks followed by oilers (I dig how it’s pooling like oil) I like most of Arizona’s except the Native American crossstitch stuff
922 2018-09-22 21:28:43 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
923 2018-09-22 21:28:30 copped a bottle of black seed oil yesterday, gets here on monday
924 2018-09-22 21:28:09 Yup. Put oil in it. You know how much I spend on my natural hair, annually? Less than $60.
925 2018-09-22 21:27:57 I hate beer and every form of cannabis I have ever tried, whole or in component, has made me horribly sick for hours or in some cases days (CBD oil wants me dead). Give me liquor or legally prescribed opioids (except Vicodin, yuk)
926 2018-09-22 21:27:55 Is not an overnight fix you dumb ass! Every line under this whole area could be compromised! This is the main reason oil is far superior to gas heat.
927 2018-09-22 21:27:52 I am telling you,the older you get the more boring life gets
928 2018-09-22 21:27:49 Carnival loses cruise ships. The Navy lost an aircraft carrier. Said Arabia lost an oil tanker. These things happen. 
929 2018-09-22 21:27:38 We we dey manage night plan with our 25# who born us to go netflix
930 2018-09-22 21:27:37 Tell you what, let Scotland keep the revenue from North Sea oil and gas and get a refund for ‘UK’ infrastructure projects with no benefit to Scotland like HS2 and London Crossrail and we’ll call it quits...

933 2018-09-22 21:26:41 By the way, Saudi arabi without oil is like a country full of piss with morons running around dazed in the deserts since brain is a commodity you people do not have. I mean look at MBS a monkey in a king outfit. How ugly?
934 2018-09-22 21:26:38 Lol keep a car for years well maintained, Jesus Christ! Is that from an ASE pamphlet?? Sure there are things like of course changing oil, fluids, not delaying spark plugs, etc. that prevent a lot of mechanical failure...
935 2018-09-22 21:26:37 When you go to Australia to live, do you row a boat or sail? If not stop being such a  hypocrite. Your carbon footprint is 100 times higher than the average person yet you ramble on about oil and gas. You call McKenna a hypocrite? Laughable, keep blithering King Hypocrite.#dummy
936 2018-09-22 21:26:33 "The majority of fans" lol you talking Oil money FC plastics? Pogba "sucks" yet he's somehow by far the best player on United lol interesting

938 2018-09-22 21:26:23 Every time I go for an oil change, I’m told something else needs to be changed. Some dumb type of filter. Always end up paying more then I’m suppose to 
939 2018-09-22 21:26:21 Why they take the lids off the bottles when you buy em at lucas oil lmao
940 2018-09-22 21:26:21 Adult life na scam ooo 
941 2018-09-22 21:26:12 Just buy a funnel and talk and research the best oil for your car
942 2018-09-22 21:25:57 I’ve started using Maroula oil. It’s a whole new world. It’s in my moisturiser already but adding a couple more drops went to next level. Brand I use is Drunk Elephant (their hydration serum is amazing too. Dave uses it post-riding for sun and wind relief)
943 2018-09-22 21:25:56 i need an oil change and clean my car but will i do it? probably not bc im lazy
944 2018-09-22 21:25:37 Lol just facts bro
945 2018-09-22 21:25:33 I've been saying this for ages. Announce a move towards Scandic style pensions as soon as we go indy, to be paid from the money we spend on warmongering and from the oil in our waters. 

We'd stroll it.
946 2018-09-22 21:25:31 Stick to the grid and don't overthink it - have your long term lvels and work backwards - oil has so much noise esp when such big spec emotion out there
947 2018-09-22 21:25:27 I wonder if the men who lose their jobs in the oil industry will be offered retraining for the childcare industry.

950 2018-09-22 21:25:09 Uhh the graph doesn't match the headline. 

Other than some oil patches, the middle is doing the same as the coasts. 

More right wing propaganda.
951 2018-09-22 21:24:53 Got my oil and edibles through tsa #bless
952 2018-09-22 21:24:27 Is 185 KWh a week electricity a lot for a 5 people 4 bedroom house with oil fired central heating? It sure feels like a lot (£30)

956 2018-09-22 21:23:12 how do you dismbiguate the time to reach boiling temp with the speed you add oil?
957 2018-09-22 21:23:11 A really simple rule of thumb for bulgogi I learned when I lived in Korea was "1:1:0.5" - for each 100g (about ¼ lb) of beef, use 1T soy sauce and ½T sugar.  Then also put in garlic and a little bit of sesame oil and pepper, and that's all you need.
958 2018-09-22 21:22:45 Thank you!
959 2018-09-22 21:22:37 Hahaha you’re so right! I can’t believe that went overlooked! Too many cooks in the kitchen I guess 
960 2018-09-22 21:22:35 I order oils from PureFX. Almond and argan have been the nicest to my futzy skin so far. Neem oil is also good for calming breakouts
961 2018-09-22 21:22:35 Break the Iran Nuclear Deal to spite that Black President, and then get all upset about OPEC oil prices going up. You caused it; own it.
962 2018-09-22 21:22:20 Reply 6/n: Parties like AFD must understand west cannot have it both ways. US, UK,France do dirty deals with the Saudi regime- the backer globally of intolerant Salafi Islamic ideology. Western oil dependent economies do this to guarantee high standard of living to their citizens
963 2018-09-22 21:22:12 i forgot how to paint with oil colours 
964 2018-09-22 21:22:07 avocado oil mayo has a weird taste at first and then you get used to it

965 2018-09-22 21:22:03 @WholeFoods : prepared  foods are drenched, dripping in canola oil (stop it!) and too many ingredients. Please simplify and use less oil.
966 2018-09-22 21:21:53 Now you are complete!
967 2018-09-22 21:21:29 humm... why is that ? definitely not because it was the main us ally in ME during the Shah rule even though his rule was one of the most brutal and the country had of the highest income inequality on the world at the time despite massive oil reserves
968 2018-09-22 21:21:15 If you read what SHE has said, she uses CBD oil all the time in various forms and vapes weed *maybe* once a week. Regardless, like I said above, it would be virtually impossible to get a secondhand high by proximity. And don’t you think her husband would notice if he did?
969 2018-09-22 21:21:11 Yes...why isn't South Korea all #renewables ? Highly industrialized tiny country w bigger carbon footorint than Canada...running on competitor oil, nat gas and COAL.
970 2018-09-22 21:21:08 This is only my second day trying it. I don’t even have the MCT oil yet so I’m substituting with coconut oil but MCT gives you much better results!
971 2018-09-22 21:21:06 James 5:13-14 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

979 2018-09-22 21:20:14 I am talking about Bako. I apologize. All we have now is Stanton and enough said. We need real leadership for these kids. A vet that is willing to accept not going back up like Hamilton. Or Frazier.

They produce oil, so does dozens of other less problematic countries.

996 2018-09-22 21:17:44 Pls RT! If palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets drops infamous #palmoil company @Indofood, @PepsiCo & @Nestle’s business partner, it’ll send a powerful message that Indofood must stop exploiting workers, or be forced out of the market.

1001 2018-09-22 21:17:07 This is appalling. How is thisnl different from what cigarette makers did? It's time for us all to file a class action lawsuit against big oil for conspiring to profit from the destruction of our planet.

1019 2018-09-22 21:12:28 Women act like they have to walk to the river to get the water, LOL. Home appliances do most of the work. Wish I had a machine that could do oil changes by pressing a few buttons.
1020 2018-09-22 21:12:25 First time ever I took my car to get a oil change and they didn’t say anything else was wrong 
1021 2018-09-22 21:12:23 where tf can I buy beard oil that’s not online......
1022 2018-09-22 21:12:13 Also evidence linking the word to the Latin 'pinguis', which means "fat" or "oil". Possibly a link to the early whalers who may have used the meat and oil from the birds?
1023 2018-09-22 21:12:10 We have enough oil snakemen up  here........your not getting Scotland. We see the state of Wales at your hands.....
1024 2018-09-22 21:12:07 We are now at the smelly oil convention. God help me.
1025 2018-09-22 21:12:00 Of course they knew! I still say U.S. didn't learn its lesson from the OPEC oil crisis in the 70's. I'm old enough to remember long lines at the pump and odd/even days. We should have begun kicking our dependence on oil back then. We could have led the world being green.
1026 2018-09-22 21:11:55 provolone, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, salt, pepper, oregano, oil and vinegar
1027 2018-09-22 21:11:38 Clearly creating a SWP using oil tax revenues / dividends from a partly nationalised oil industry is different to doing it by just using taxes to nationalise domestic stuff as Matt suggests, barrier is politics not maths
1028 2018-09-22 21:11:17 Venezuela owes Russia and China a monthly quota of their oil output. Those nations have debt collectors that don't play games.
1029 2018-09-22 21:11:16 I still blame the southern elders the northern elites have the game planned out. They will use the oil as collateral for loans to develop the north and thereafter call for restructuring

Adulting
1031 2018-09-22 21:10:54 Then I add the noodles back in and stir it up. So now the noodles themselves are nice and aromatic. Of course, you don’t want too much oil or your sauce will slip off the noodles too much, but I think it’s a nice touch.
1032 2018-09-22 21:10:43 Thank goodness the weather cooled off this weekend, so I could change my car's oil w/o risking heatstroke..

1034 2018-09-22 21:10:37 Friday during science, Mrs. Royal and her 6th graders went to the science lab to test how to remove oil from an oil spill. Looks like a good time was had by all! #nfcs 
1035 2018-09-22 21:10:26 America is a snake oil salesman in bombs and bullets when it's not eyeing natural resources for the US 1%. The game is up. Donald Trump is president ffs. I pity the marines working in 40foot containers in Texas driving bomber drones in "conflict zones" thousands of miles away

1038 2018-09-22 21:09:57 I also started doing one other thing when I make pasta. Once the noodles are cooked enough I put them in a colander and then put a bit of olive oil in the (now empty) pan and add some basil and parsley to that and put it back on the hot stove for just a moment so it gets hot.
1039 2018-09-22 21:09:52 He confused the suntan lotion for cooking oil

1047 2018-09-22 21:08:20 Use the modern technology to help these countries fight climate change, instead of creating super weapins and attack them fir their oil, diamonds or whatever resource they have. Migrants are cheap labor, but preferebly to stay out of EU, at least in CEE.

1053 2018-09-22 21:07:06 ok so he was prob' in on it with mossad but look at it from point of view in that: 'he was able to make the decision', and yeah, it was a kinda biggie for the time, look what Israel ended up with?-banks, oil, $, MENA on tap, oh yeah, even now it was a biggie........?
1054 2018-09-22 21:07:03 Omg I need lemon essential oil.  Need to make a recipe which hope it will help with my continual sinus drainage.
1055 2018-09-22 21:06:55 Yes, he drives oil prices higher. His friends, #CrookedSaudiRoyals , don’t care when he talks lower prices.
1056 2018-09-22 21:06:33 I try to go for an Arrabbiata style usually so it's great. adding them to the hot oil for a short bit makes a nice difference too imo
1057 2018-09-22 21:06:30 That's the thing about economic predictions, they're often wrong, especially when you don't factor in US & Saudi colluding in flooding the market to bring the oil price down for political reasons. Guess the Torygraph thinks she should apologise for that too

1072 2018-09-22 21:03:51 The oil is another thing I won’t really make a big deal out of considering some vegans say they deal with their food being cooked in the same oil but the waiter legit said it’s vegetarian NOT vegan.  Either he’s been misinformed or Somebody lied!!

1099 2018-09-22 21:00:22 I don't dig the America First vibe. Also, if I was worried about oil and Middle East involvement, I'd argue first for much lower speed limits. Then I'd argue for natural gas powered transportation. After that, you can electrify transportation.
1100 2018-09-22 21:00:21 Just taught 3 adults, each at least 5 years older than me, how to jump-start their car. 

This, along with knowing how to mount a spare tire and checking your oil should be required to get a drivers license.

1108 2018-09-22 20:59:08 Gas money isn't just for gas. It's for the gas, oil, wear and tear of the tires, and etc. So if you get mad over a couple of dollars you can walk.

1112 2018-09-22 20:58:59 Baloney. No subsidies to #fossilfuels  in Canada. That report paid for by CLIMATEWORKS anti oil billionaires. Wonder if they are vulture investors, too.

1115 2018-09-22 20:58:42 irwin, you fool, how many oil companies have filed for bankruptcy?  Usually right after they have taken the oil and it is time to clean up.
And you are talking about subsidies??? How pathetic.
1116 2018-09-22 20:58:41 @Gavin_White07 I'm afraid you're a victim of false information. The sad truth is that Scotland is actually financing England. Nevermind oil, water, electricity whisky alone earns £25 Billion heavens there's only 5 million of a population
1117 2018-09-22 20:58:33 Yee thanks for the oil change love 
1118 2018-09-22 20:58:28 That's akin to Obama taking office in 2009 & saying "I'm not responsible for the 2008 financial crisis." The people voted based on a bunch of lies & snake oil sold to them by people like Boris Johnson & Nigel Farage. There's no sense going through w/such an economy-wrecking move.
1119 2018-09-22 20:58:17 Cruz went to jiffy lube to change the oil in his hair.
1120 2018-09-22 20:58:16 I understand that being vegan doesn’t mean “purity” but more so about reducing the harm caused to animals so some vegans deal with their food being cooked in the same oil as meat. However, how you cook shrimp and chicken in the same oil? Because allergies. Smh.

1126 2018-09-22 20:57:02 Joe are you still Pay-tience with oil? Trump/Iran no doubt holding this up.
1127 2018-09-22 20:57:00 /5 why is Cdn oil 'dirty' but the Los Angeles hidden oil rigs in downtown deemed 'clean' by Hollywwod stars? Maybe their millions are in wind and solar? Vested interests like Leo.

She takes off into the house AND HAS A RAT TRAP STUCK TO HER ASS! THE GOOEY STICKY TRAPS! Dawn isn't just for oil spills, you guys.

1135 2018-09-22 20:55:41 I meant 2 years ago, in 2016. I voted for Jill Stein proudly and would do it again too. I voted to not kill civilians in needless wars and not increase military spending or oil drilling or fracking. I voted to regulate banks and Wall Street.

I would do it all again too. Proudly.
1136 2018-09-22 20:55:30 Bro, coconut oil saved my life 
1137 2018-09-22 20:54:29 /4 why do you think Green TRADE War #climateers decided to call it 'dirty' oil ? Modern medecine could not operate w/o all the products and power of 'dirty' oil /5
1138 2018-09-22 20:54:26 Hey @jiffylube if you could learn how to tighten an oil filter properly that would be great!!! Now that I’ve crawled my ass under my truck and done it right myself, I’ll now clean my driveway. #halfassed
1139 2018-09-22 20:54:22 Yesterday I made a tomato sauce. I added onions and three bay leaves to hot oil in a pan. Once the onions were browned I added whole tomatoes as well and let everything get really aromatic. Then I removed the (whole) tomatoes and used my immersion blender to make a sauce and

1146 2018-09-22 20:52:51 Seseme oil slow roasted pumpkin and garlic with whatever herbs you like and whatever stock you like, cream or vegan whatever, cos it works with whatever you like 
1147 2018-09-22 20:52:43 Exactly! I was so mad last night that I just got up from the table and walked out the restaurant. He kept pushing, “are you vegan or vegetarian” because none of these items are vegan and we cook vegetarian food in the same oil as chicken and shrimp.
1148 2018-09-22 20:52:34 Since I needed a thank you gift for my friends who have been here for me since my mom passed . I’m gifting them the new @fentybeauty lip and some @adwoabeautyllc oil. Nothing like great skin / scalp and a great lip!

Never buying an Interstate Batteries car battery from Costco ever again. This battery is less than 2 years old
1154 2018-09-22 20:51:04 Appreciate good discussion here & below. I'd say only that a solid take on the Satpayev investment would require (1) being a petroleum geologist, (2) access to the seismic data. Many wells with high hopes are dry. Google "Mukluk oil"! Lack of PR is interesting but not dispositive
1155 2018-09-22 20:51:00 Scottish handouts?  You mean that Barnett formulae?  Mate, you don't even know how much Scotland's assets are being ripped off.  An independent Scotland would be far richer than the 'so called' rUK.  And before you say 'oil', we'd still be better off, even if we had none.
1156 2018-09-22 20:50:55 I understand some restaurants that offer vegetarian/vegan food cook them in the same oil as meat. However, why would you cook chicken & shrimp in the same oil when most people have a shellfish allergy? I don’t trust restaurants that aren’t 100% plant based.

1164 2018-09-22 20:48:26 Went to Yard House last night & the waiter gave me a hard time, insisting that the items on the Gardein menu was vegetarian and cannot be made vegan. He also said everything is cooked in the same oil as chicken and shrimp. Yet, according to PETA, selective items can be veganized!
1165 2018-09-22 20:48:25 My heart goes out to the young 5 year old girl who lost her life after visiting Disney world.  She had other health issues like siezures CBD oil might have helped but she got a stomach bug the Doc said it was a stomach virus.
1166 2018-09-22 20:48:10 I bought an oil warmer and I’m totally in love. Why did it take me this long! 
1167 2018-09-22 20:48:01 This money comes from State of Alaska Permanent Fund earnings, which belong to the people of Alaska. Are you saying we should give those earnings to the oil companies?

1211 2018-09-22 20:42:08 No need for insults. Whether part or all of the oil and gas comes from Scotland to Ireland is irrelevant. Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, that still stands today as the majority of Scotland wants to remain so. Scotland joined England in union after financial ruin.

1238 2018-09-22 20:39:08 They quoted the other day they would be happy with oil above $80. And others question how much they all can bring , not enough Investment is going back in to the oil market . But oil trading between 70 - 80 works for most , but some countries will have to adapt.

1240 2018-09-22 20:39:03 Looks like the managed money funded narrative pushers in #OOTT are back with their "spare capacity" horse shit. If they were right then OPEC should just disband. Yet if OPEC disbanded tomorrow, oil would drop to $10. Quite telling... #WTI #Oil #CrudeOil #Crude #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
1241 2018-09-22 20:38:55 Agree.  That is how a snake oil salesman works.
1242 2018-09-22 20:38:44 Essential oils! I used it for an ovarian cyst issue which can also be used for ovarian cancer and it worked. For lung cancer use Frankincense, Rosemary, Chamomile and peppermint or tea tree oil. Rub on chest twice daily four drops of each.

1245 2018-09-22 20:37:58 There are also a range of causes of inflation beyond the crude 'too much  money chasing too many goods', especially in context of 1970s with the  oil price shocks, etc. 

Raising taxes wouldn't have done anything to change the dynamics with OPEC, for example.

1252 2018-09-22 20:35:58 It's always convenient to call these U-S based anti #Alberta oil foundations with Cdn charity status, lobbyists. Lobbying is a euphemism for bribing & corrupting stakeholders, with one end game, sabotaging Canadian jobs.  @FairQuestions
1253 2018-09-22 20:35:39 You know autumn's here, it's cold outside and they just want a nice, warm little home to their families. SORRY! But I often find spiders in my room too. It's not unusual especially in the colder months. I heard citrus and/or peppermint oil helps to get rid of them.
1254 2018-09-22 20:35:36 Idk who daughter needs to see this but get an oil change ma
1255 2018-09-22 20:35:35 Neo-Liberal Snake Oil salesman.

Certainly no Progressive and antithetical to policies that would uplift the Working Class.

1256 2018-09-22 20:35:16 Try it...Let the palm oil "gba daadaa".
1257 2018-09-22 20:34:30 After having new breaks and an oil and filter change on the Beamer the indicator lights get a reset making me a happy bunny but before I’ve even got home the bloody car detects another warning! That car is more stressful than going to work and that’s saying something
1258 2018-09-22 20:34:29 I wish there was a sesame oil scented candle. 

In other news, I’m cooking with sesame oil.
1259 2018-09-22 20:34:28 A Saudi oil minister?
1260 2018-09-22 20:34:25 It supposedly has less stuff that causes cancer. He should try vaping cbd oil. Helps me a little with sleep.
1261 2018-09-22 20:34:21 I try to get a haircut , the barber shop is closed. I go to change my oil , can’t because my car won’t fit in their guard rails. How’s your Saturday?
1262 2018-09-22 20:33:57 This is just that change your oil tweet boiiiiii
1263 2018-09-22 20:33:48 Damn @therealstylesp posted one before it was black seed oil and I forgot what else
1264 2018-09-22 20:33:48 Omg this will help so much..  I’m looking at more cures. Soursop, CBD/RSO oil
1265 2018-09-22 20:33:37 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
1266 2018-09-22 20:33:37 This is why you’re gonna need new struts and tires and alignment all the time. Also check your fuckin oil
1267 2018-09-22 20:33:35 Makes sense. The oil industry seem to work by different rules from the car (or whatever) industry. They seem to be able to operate in amazingly hostile/dangerous environments.
1268 2018-09-22 20:33:32 Tesla is having a very difficult time in the  market.
I agree with electric vehicles .
Only 2% in the world and transformation will take decades.
We still need oil workers, why not  instead of ...........

1269 2018-09-22 20:33:23 Seeing as the world is using 100 million barrels of oil per day, and the IEA is projecting it to rise again next year, he seems to be on the right side.

1275 2018-09-22 20:32:27 Finally got around to getting my oil changed and servicing my breaks!
1276 2018-09-22 20:32:16 Obama/Kerry lifted all restrictions on Iran and gave them a pathway to Nuclear Armament. Lifting the restrictions would have benefitted Iran by approximately $150 Billion in one year, Oil revenues, etc. @realDonaldTrump has reimplemented the Restrictions nullifying the Windfall.
1277 2018-09-22 20:31:54 Just took a 20 min nap in the dealership lobby waiting to get my trucks oil changed
1278 2018-09-22 20:31:41 cause dont you lose a lot of heat if you cook/dry them? isnt the capsacin in the seed as an oil predominantly?
1279 2018-09-22 20:31:35 I bring my own windex and paper towels. Otherwise it’s pretty much like wiping vegetable oil on a window with Saran Wrap.
1280 2018-09-22 20:31:24 Hi, hope you're well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you

1285 2018-09-22 20:30:39 mmmm dont know for sure.. you could pour tons of money but what can you do without personnel who are emigrating by the hundreds from the oil industry here? well unless there's a hidden privatisation and our industry being sold to china and russia bringing own personnel
1286 2018-09-22 20:30:22 And we need full control over all of our taxes.  Westminster has squandered the oil revenue, look at how Norway managed their oil revenue. Westminster just saw a fast buck and no intention of investing it
1287 2018-09-22 20:30:22 He might as well make some money being an in the tank mouthpiece for Big Dirty Oil.
1288 2018-09-22 20:30:20 The entire organization is a disgrace they are ruining a great game with a coach who massages his bat with coconut oil puts reference cards in players pockets to think for them  they are fundamentally unsound what the hell is going on broadcasters horrible I miss the old days
1289 2018-09-22 20:30:13 exactly. they both have monopoly in up and down stream. and all stream that can exist in oil sector
1290 2018-09-22 20:30:13 Why is our house mate going in the bathroom with raspeed oil ? Tbh im not sure i want to know
1291 2018-09-22 20:29:56 @olasupobadmos @Arsenal #morallesson not all oil workers will make it more than all pure water Sellers.
1292 2018-09-22 20:29:52 If you have a can of tuna around (in water, not oil, and with no salt added) open it, and drain the water through a small strainer into a small saucer. Works as a great “cheer up” for my fur people, and it’s actually healthy. Maybe see if Elwood likes it.
1293 2018-09-22 20:29:46 Just tried oil pulling. Nearly been sick 3 times!

1295 2018-09-22 20:29:34 That’s what I got too. Even in frack-happy Western Pa., lack of pipelines is a problem and of course, oil trains are greatly feared because of decaying train tracks and potential for derailments
1296 2018-09-22 20:29:18 Thank you! I am currently testing your tea tree oil so I hope you enjoy my post 
1297 2018-09-22 20:29:11 Doing a hot oil treatment on my locs for the first time. We gone see how this goes
1298 2018-09-22 20:29:10 Getting my oil changed. The person ahead of me was just told they'd get free top-offs for "three thousand and three months". That's a very generous deal!
1299 2018-09-22 20:29:04 Unfortunate discovery it turned out to be as hir employer saw no value in conversion of valuable crude oil into useless fungal sludge, and with prodding from M.

1306 2018-09-22 20:28:03 The 'medical system' was NEVER designed to succeed relative to anything remotely close to a 'cure.' Their paradigm rests on Rockefeller's need/greed for more $$ than big oil was providing. Moved petrochemicals into 'medicines.' They ONLY SUPPRESS SYMPTOMS and cause toxicity.
1307 2018-09-22 20:27:58 Biotin + fish oil pills did wonders for me. Their water is  also try switching to more natural shampoos, it helps more than you think
1308 2018-09-22 20:27:46 I actually have a great recipe for quinoa. You have to add something to it. I add blackbeans, grape tomatoes, scallions, and make a olive oil and cumin dressing for it. It's delicious. Oh, and you can add red onions.

1313 2018-09-22 20:26:53 Fear and love are like oil and water, they repel each other. They can exist in the same container yet the container never be filled entirely with water or entirely with oil.
1314 2018-09-22 20:26:47 LOL. No thanks. We'd just like you to stop sending imbeciles and snake oil salesmen to try to negotiate with the grown ups.

Maybe if Trump thinks he should have a say in how Canada runs its dairy industry he should have to apply for Canadian citizenship?
1315 2018-09-22 20:26:44 Much discussion here but the best one of the day (by a  whisker) was the heritage tomato. The dill oil and horseradish and the amazing finely grated cucumber salad, such big flavours but all harmonious.
1316 2018-09-22 20:26:35 They have no business being in the West. It's oil and water, incompatible beyond the level of a tiny minority. 

I'm tired of being lectured about how I need to change and accommodate, in my home, by and for people I never asked to come here. They already have their own nations.
1317 2018-09-22 20:26:24 Coconut oil, avocado, raw honey, teaspoon of apple cider vinegar just made the best face scrub 
1318 2018-09-22 20:26:23 You must be an oilfield guy? I see you're from Walsh, I'm in Athabasca and worked the oil patch for a few years. All our snow melted except for the couple forts the boys built. Blessings
1319 2018-09-22 20:26:21 WTF unleaded by me has gone to £1.40 per litre Diesel is £1.45. This has nothing to do with Brexit. Oil prices are reported as being lower.
 Soon only the Rich will have cars or is that their goal.
1320 2018-09-22 20:26:10 We Can challenge it.
Go and open your firm for crude oil supply.
Once you get the Permission.
Open few Petro pump and take Oil from Reliance.
Then go abroad and do partnership with them and sell 99% shares.
Hence you will be free and no one can blame you 
1321 2018-09-22 20:26:06 I don't know much about oil sector but I heard ONGC and IOCL are doing good. (in terms of income)

1323 2018-09-22 20:25:34 The pegging to sterling is a short lived mechanism , with the goal of pegging between Euro and Sterling via as you mentioned a central bank (soverign).

The real money is in selling oil in NSP , the McCrone report hints at that very thing.

1325 2018-09-22 20:25:12 It's a bit of a mess right enough, nobody seems to be pulling in the same direction but in defence of the board maybe they are fed up throwing good money after bad .. we are not in the position of having oil magnets with unlimitless money at our disposal

1329 2018-09-22 20:24:48 I appreciate your passion, but we will need to agree to disagree as I believe pipe to be safer than rail. Also who said the demand is not there? WA refiners are getting oil from AS and even Russia. TMPx would displace some of that, reducing shipping under less rigorous rules.
1330 2018-09-22 20:24:45 Good idea bot serial number bar84212702. Maybe I could come over to your mothership and oil your joints? 
1331 2018-09-22 20:24:38 I did stop my meds cold turkey. I don't use the oil I use the powder form. I use it three times a day and it has helped me So much.

1345 2018-09-22 20:22:38 It is hard to say no to oil money when their souls are morally corrupt.
1346 2018-09-22 20:22:37 So far during this visit my dad has only communicated to me through car-related things. So for example, “when was the last time you got an oil change” was basically him telling me “I love you.”
1347 2018-09-22 20:22:30 In US prices of Petro is much cheaper if we compare it with here.
In India they don't allow foreign company becoz otherwise all govt semi govt oil companies will fail.
Take to much Taxes on that and play the Game of Victim card.
1348 2018-09-22 20:22:00 Just remember, when oil pulling, don't swallow any of it, as it will be loaded with toxins that are being pulled from inside your blood stream as well as your mouth.

1354 2018-09-22 20:21:39 Oil at $80 a barrel makes non-renewable energy look even less appealing. In the meantime, the oil monarchies are running surpluses. They need to use that to stimulate their economies and spend on private sector growth

1384 2018-09-22 20:17:09 Plus, regardless of the oil we may grow more away from UK, and my strong suspicion is that we will. There are risks on going Indy, but nowhere near as big as often assumed. I actually don't mind having less anyway if we are a kinder society.

1386 2018-09-22 20:16:37 Well put! Hoping to see better players come to Phillies via free agency and unload some poor players. Also put players in their natural positions. Sick of Captain Coconut Oil’s all positive attitude.
1387 2018-09-22 20:16:32 Is it palm oil free?

1391 2018-09-22 20:16:07 Have you ever added palm oil to noodles before? Tastes like a piece of heaven 
1392 2018-09-22 20:15:55 Love the straw idea. Extra butter always- but come on, is it really butter anyway?? Blended Butter flavored oil
1393 2018-09-22 20:15:41 *OMAN SAYS TRUMP TWEETS HAVE MORE IMPACT ON OIL PRICE THAN OPEC
......ok Oman may need some US investments sooner than later.....
1394 2018-09-22 20:15:38 we need a real baseball coach not a massage therapist specialist in rubbing bats with coconut oil and spits ice cream out after sucking it for flavor whoever hired this joke has to go as well this is a disgrace
1395 2018-09-22 20:15:34 Your claims of oil & gas subsidies are based on thermodynamics? 
1396 2018-09-22 20:15:14 As someone who works in the energy/oil sector, they areclamouring to get more women working in the field. I work with female tradespersons, but the fact is a majority of women are not willing to work the hours and out of town. Has nothing to do with qualifications/ability/sexism.
1397 2018-09-22 20:15:13 I won’t lie my skin is naturally like this. I apply baby oil though.
1398 2018-09-22 20:15:04 Trying to give factual examples without doxxing myself on this donald trump thread.

I make $53 more per paycheck since the tax cuts went through, oil and gas prices have gone down in my immediate area, albeit cents at a time.

Live in IL, work out of Indiana, paid @ IL tax rate

1401 2018-09-22 20:14:49 Will he lose his annual oil reimbursement?  Being that it is Alaska I bet he and the judge are distant cousins or something.
1402 2018-09-22 20:14:20 Soon china will make yr people invisible too...

You buy gas @ oil at incredible rates.
Seriously you dream  of J&K?????
1403 2018-09-22 20:14:05 A little tea tree oil on a qtip does it nicely. Rub the sticker then wait a few minutes and it slides right off.

1405 2018-09-22 20:13:48 Today, while getting my oil change, my dad picks up an @espn magazine and I have to explain who @Ninja is and why he’s on the cover in the midst football season. #changingtimes #eSports

I should not be allowed to adult.
1416 2018-09-22 20:12:23 They've frustrated every peace effort, I just don't really know what their problem is.

1420 2018-09-22 20:11:35 You are right Iran. Saddam was a demon,dictator & blood thirsty. But Mr Trump is taking a different route. And further,he is a democratically elected head of a state.Hence, Iran shall tread carefully & solve the deadlock by talking to US. This will REDUCE Oil Criss in the region

1430 2018-09-22 20:10:24 Addendum: Poorly maintained roads & highways have a DIRECT impact on your wallet - car/trucks cost more to service & wear out faster.

1441 2018-09-22 20:09:19 Agreed, because yam and palm oil with fresh pepper is food for the Gods.
1442 2018-09-22 20:09:08 um @DietCoke if you can make coke's with CBD oil then, you can recontinue the distribution of Diet Coke vanilla; thank you that has been my ted talk
1443 2018-09-22 20:09:08 I don’t have a problem with American Republicans as such, although my views don’t generally align with theirs. I do have a problem with @realDonaldTrump. He promises his snake oil cure to his base’s ailments, but he’s too incompetent to actually deal with it.
1444 2018-09-22 20:08:51 You do realize the purpose for "pushing oil through a steel shaft" is to burn it, which, and this may come as a surprise, impacts the environment?
1445 2018-09-22 20:08:38 Booooo. ROFL. Dar gaye. ROFL. Ur army can't fight a week. U have no funds bibi. Ur going begging to IMF for funds to run the country. U need oil reserves to fight a war.
1446 2018-09-22 20:07:57 I configured the dictation language in MS Word to MX Spanish, then read aloud Capítulo V of the Reglamento de la Ley Petrolera de 1941, which treats E&P by oil companies of "mixed economies." This model would be adopted by Statoil in 1972 & other NOCs later, but not yet in MX.
1447 2018-09-22 20:07:47 yeah, why risk getting oil from a fragile ecosystem when countries like Canada can produce so much cleanly and safely? Now if only Western Canada oil producers had a means of exporting to offshore markets but they're limited by a small old pipeline that is full serving local mkt.
1448 2018-09-22 20:07:30 Should’ve soaked them in sump oil first
1449 2018-09-22 20:07:29 Decided to grill 3 pieces of chicken in the halogen oven and I ended up getting so much oil out of it. I could actually make stew with it, I'm not exaggerating.

OK...

I applied for a grant to produce perpetual motion automobiles.

That's when I learned Conspiracies aren't fake news
1452 2018-09-22 20:06:52 Are they looking for slogans? 
"Gas for Girls:  It's only fair"
"Ladies Laying Pipe:  It's about time."
"Drilling For  Oil"   is Pronounced "Drillin' Fo' All"   for a Reason!
1453 2018-09-22 20:06:31 Yeah, my skin is really sensitive. I actually liked it, but my esthetician told me I couldn’t use it anymore. I switched to rose hip oil.
1454 2018-09-22 20:06:05 How about a spoonful of coconut oil?
1455 2018-09-22 20:05:57 Think what the World would look like today! The Koch's bought the Republican Party through Citizens United! Remember the Bush family is Oil!

1457 2018-09-22 20:05:39 If I pushed society like a fucking stroller how fast could we get off oil????????? Jw not mad just a activistism hehe
1458 2018-09-22 20:05:26 I still can't understand the oil revenue given here. If oil price per barrel is $65 @ 1.6mbd how much is the amount.
65×360×1.6m = 37,440,000,000 per day.
When you times it to 365days we arrive at  13,366,560,000,000.00 in words is about N 13.3 trillion.
1459 2018-09-22 20:05:12 I wouldn't take his advice on what a restaurants best dish is. What kind of oil to buy for my car. If a school was good for my kid.

1469 2018-09-22 20:03:01 ELectric car isn’t just replacing oil engine. It’s more than car, it’s about a new life style and a feeling to be part of game changers community.  #Audi, #MercedesBenz, #VW aren’t part of this trend.
1470 2018-09-22 20:03:01 Know how you stay sane during a #crypto bear market? Do other things. I took up oil painting and I watch football on Saturdays. What do you do?
1471 2018-09-22 20:02:52 But US allows mentally ill people to be abandoned in sheriff van and drown in flooding while 2 driving the van were rescued. Your argument is flawed. Try harder. (Also, Venezuela is under crippling sanctions (they have oil we want)). 
1472 2018-09-22 20:02:31 I would much rather hope that LNG suppliers cut deals directly with the end users rather than commodity traders, as it will reduce the spot market use of LNG and stabilize the LNG prices in the long run, rather than being traded as a volatile commodity such as oil.
1473 2018-09-22 20:02:19 Venezuela didn't have capability of producing said oil on a global level.
1474 2018-09-22 20:02:18 i’ve been using a hydrating oil lately. it has hyaluronic acid in it and it’s was only like $8 from tj maxx and i’ve found tht it helps matte foundation go on a lot smoother!

1477 2018-09-22 20:01:43 Apparently this only works if you mix skittles in with the CBD oil, they need to be ground into a paste and then mixed with it, then add diluted marinara sauce in a saline solution.
1478 2018-09-22 20:01:41 Try using air cans to clean out dust the fans. You can try oiling up the fans where it spins. Please use a q tip and dont drench it in oil. Hope it helps.

Don't join these leaders to put suffering on Nigerians.
1488 2018-09-22 19:59:29 First you exfoliate, then you use toner or moisturizer. Both toner and moisturizer act as a barrier for oil and dirt. I use toner more than moisturizer 
1489 2018-09-22 19:59:28 I think you need to stop burning crosses and instead burn the midnight oil studying.

1496 2018-09-22 19:57:35 I got no problem with oil. Make good money off of it. I got problems with these yoyos trying to tell us that shipping the stuff raw is good for the economy.
1497 2018-09-22 19:57:28 Nasal sprays or decongestant tablets. If you want something less medical, I usually put tea tree oil in a bowl and do a steam to try and ease up the congestion and loosen the blood vessels!
1498 2018-09-22 19:57:16 Get a grip, all corps act in self interest oil or otherwise. The fact is oil companies large and small drive a large part of our economy. If you are happy living in poverty great it’s coming. You think a national debt crisis can’t happen here?

1522 2018-09-22 19:51:42 And here we see the gospel preached and needs met being done at the same time.

[Mar 6:12-13 NKJV] So they went out and preached that people should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.
1523 2018-09-22 19:51:06 I love my manual but as soon as there's a fun, sporty, affordable EV with a ~200 mile range, I'm in. Instant torque, no more gas stations, no more oil changes, spark plugs, etc. Hell yeah.
1524 2018-09-22 19:51:06 Oil dey ur head
1525 2018-09-22 19:50:36 I agree with you. People need to STOP following him! I personally never followed that snake oil salesman.
1526 2018-09-22 19:50:32 Why?The kinder Morgan isn’t even started.They go together.Unlike the idiot Harper who shut them down then said let’s ship oil.We saidno No coastguard no oil.Trudeau said if there’s oil there’s coastguard stations reopening.What’s so hard about that?Oh right You’re a conservative
1527 2018-09-22 19:50:25 Because my skill doesn’t line up with renewable industry. And I would bet there are far more lower paying jobs in solar industry than oil industry.
1528 2018-09-22 19:50:14 So there is a light on in my car that says, change engine oil soon but I JUST had an oil change. I don’t get it

I meant to ask her if I could use CBD oil and forgot. Dang it.
1571 2018-09-22 19:43:16 You’re menu says $35, so why is the total $50. Random bs charges for takeoff, tips, long tips, oil, etc. I’m over it.

Today I set the kitchen on fire. Turns out that oil is harder to use than I expected. I barely made it out alive. 

If this is my last written word, I want to be buried with a bottle of firewhiskey.

1587 2018-09-22 19:40:20 Perhaps...but that has nothing to do about exporting oil to Asia, which is what the #TMX is all about.

1598 2018-09-22 19:39:14 is it me, or did Ted borrow his logo from an Oil Company? Or is a big giant tear drop?
1599 2018-09-22 19:39:14 Feeling better? If not, try @LeeParpart (matter of fact I just felt need & took oil of oregano & zinc) and Vit C and hot broths w garlic, onion, herbs/oregano are key - old school/momma recipes & plenty of sleep as @spchronicles advises (I never get enough)

And we still only have 1 refinery here on the coast...so no reason to send any more trains of bitumen this way. These’s trains are heading south, the the US from AB.

1607 2018-09-22 19:37:40 Very good point but we need total quantity of crude oil sold in 2017 and 2015 or 2014 to know the gross earnings in Naira and critically appraise @OfficialAPCNg position on their slogan of “meager resources “ that led to heavy borrowings. Not ALL can be deceived.

1615 2018-09-22 19:35:29 It is not. The other problem is the exogenous ketones and MCT oil don’t stick around for very long.
1616 2018-09-22 19:35:18 My cat decided today she’d put her stealth CIA tactics to the test and sneak into the kitchen and turn over an entire canister of olive oil while making zero sound. Let’s just say I found out the hard way and I’m now very sore. #CatsOfTwitter #catfromhell

1633 2018-09-22 19:33:00 I believe the smartest way to heal Americans is to harness the medical power of the Panacea and feed our citizens cannabis oil to heal them directly.

1653 2018-09-22 19:30:31 Face mask & a hot oil treatment
1654 2018-09-22 19:30:29 just tried an experiment at dinner and switched up the bread accompaniments. HUGE mistake. focaccia with butter was a treat but brown bread dipped in olive oil is an abomination. posting this here so none of you are doomed to repeat history
1655 2018-09-22 19:30:25 Most, If Not All Oil Producing African Nations, Imports Refined Oil At Inflated Price From The Same Countries That Buys Their Crude Oil Cheaply.
1656 2018-09-22 19:30:25 Good lord. My apartment smells like cutting oil and sourdough starter.  All I need is a redhead to complete the trifecta.
1657 2018-09-22 19:30:09 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
1658 2018-09-22 19:30:02 The talk is not about the "growth", it is about the existing 6 mb/d that has been added within the biggest oil market in the US. 

Any talk about "crude quality" is related to shale GROWTH
1659 2018-09-22 19:29:40 Oil - seems it would never get back it’s lost glory I suppose.
1660 2018-09-22 19:29:39 Not saying it didn't happen, but there was an oil crisis in 1973. The 3 day week. 20% inflation. Also imports from and tariffs on at least some Commonwealth countries were phased over years. Are you sure it was causation and not correlation?
1661 2018-09-22 19:29:35 The glow all fun and games until I’m driving and the oil from this glowing skin get in my eyes 
1662 2018-09-22 19:28:59 The only thing I’ve learned over and over from journalists...is that journalists are idiots.
1663 2018-09-22 19:28:53 went to get an oil change and the dudes are looking in my trunk and laughing and looking at me and then laughing
1664 2018-09-22 19:28:45 And even also after manupulation during registration how is it possible the de-duplication report was successful.
This shows the total  failure of the system maintained by the Oil Corporation and further lead to suspension of the distributorship.
1665 2018-09-22 19:28:39 did you know you could use coconut oil to shave ?!! it’s makes your skin soft asf !!
1666 2018-09-22 19:28:32 From an international GHG perspective, supplying China with heavy oil replaces the coal-to liquid they have used to supply their fine chemicals market. Heavy oil is the lowest GHG intensity feedstock for that market 2/
1667 2018-09-22 19:28:30 Another point of concern,the format in which the KYC is been registered in the Oil Corporation portal isn't 100% full proof so that it enabled a distributor or its staff to manupulate.
1668 2018-09-22 19:28:07 Sardine oil eh
1669 2018-09-22 19:27:48 You tried to correct already correct spelling? Sorry,  the gun oil makes it hard to swipe on the phone.  Mommie is calling you.  Get out of the basement,  put down the vape,  tighten up your man bun and clean the deck
1670 2018-09-22 19:27:32 ok cool i’ve been using coconut oil. i’ll continue to use it my belly is super itchy lol
1671 2018-09-22 19:27:29 what's oil now?
1672 2018-09-22 19:27:27 Hey oil and bottled water companies are depleting fresh water, so I'd may as well just leave my taps running all the time because relatively it doesn't make much of a difference
1673 2018-09-22 19:27:20 It was sort of a care package from my household. A piece of my artwork, a few letters, a few poems, a lobster lapel pin, and some Peppermint and Spearmint oil which my husband's family distills on their Mint farm. Hopefully enough to provoke a smile :)
1674 2018-09-22 19:27:08 Oh gosh. Next time you should just road trip to my local oil change place where there's never a line because the town is dying.

1677 2018-09-22 19:26:53 The only primer I’ve really liked is nyx’s glitter primer for on my nose and under my eyes but other than that yeah I feel like an oil slick!!!
1678 2018-09-22 19:26:39 /2 at the global market prices. This is what we should be trying to avoid. And that makes sense. Because in BC we send our unrefined oil 2 the USA 2 B refined, then buy it back @ the global market price. Refining it here & skipping the global market prices would be a benefit.
1679 2018-09-22 19:26:39 Otra vez me acabo de acabar EL OIL!!!! VENGA YA se pone aburrido cuando me quedo sin Oil, agh ni modo poz....
1680 2018-09-22 19:26:26 يعني افهم اني  وحدة منهم؟
1681 2018-09-22 19:26:11 ... can't do that. The oil now belongs to the US as repayment for freedom... and all the depleted uranium used in Iraq....
1682 2018-09-22 19:26:03 Drive/clarify btw sm majority & int'l megacorp minority of certain selfish psycho US & Russian owners w sunk assets gotta stay sunk. European marine oil workers are adapting trade skills to put up wind generators & digging it. TX is hot. Appeal to that practical majority interest
1683 2018-09-22 19:25:53 I am all for pot, but for the love of God, it should not be used while pregnant/nursing. They don’t even recommend CBD oil because it’s believed it could inhibit fetal growth.
1684 2018-09-22 19:25:28 Theres documentation that the cooking oil industry tried to eliminate palm oil.  Why not coconut as well.
1685 2018-09-22 19:25:26 My 3 kids consistently sleep past 7:30am and I’m thinking of either selling the magic well water they’re drinking to the essential oil community or writing a book. Because voodoo sells. #ifyourenotoffendedineedtotryharder #parenting

1689 2018-09-22 19:25:03 Favorite Hospital for Mideast Oil Sheiks?
1690 2018-09-22 19:24:49 That's what I thought, holding it thru 2016 (a mistake). Too much debt and little upside unless oil goes > $90
1691 2018-09-22 19:24:31 I guess it depends on usage honestly. On days I’m rarely using mine I do it once at the end of the day but then days of high usage high phone calls I do it multiple times cause face cells, oil cells, cell cells
1692 2018-09-22 19:24:28 Yes it is good and the do not taste the mayo. It replaces the oil
1693 2018-09-22 19:24:26 But under immense pressure n target from the Oil Corporation for PMUY the distributor had to engage third parties for collectung KYC's and call centres  for registering the same in their portal.
Now,this practice lead to punishment for the distributor.
1694 2018-09-22 19:24:21 the position Max has talked about is a complex one, removing boats from the ocean carrying oil to us, would be a good thing for the environment. Building pipelines to move said oil inside of Canada to refine in Canada, and not refine in the USA then buy back that refined gas.. /1
1695 2018-09-22 19:24:18 Finally got around to posting some more @KingFallsAM fan fic. I figured as long as I was waiting around for an oil change I may as well be productive.
1696 2018-09-22 19:23:55 certainly David will do it now.
1697 2018-09-22 19:23:54 Rinaldi, Meyer just a door to door snake oil salesman

1699 2018-09-22 19:23:51 @AldiUSA I'm sick and tired of your creepy olive oil commercial. That still doesn't mean I'm going to pay monthly for no ads on VRV 
1700 2018-09-22 19:23:39 does coconut oil work for preventing stretch marks? or should i just buy bio oil?
1701 2018-09-22 19:23:37 The distributor had dedicated his last ten years in serving it's  valuable customers as well as maintaining the dignity of the Oil Corporation.
1702 2018-09-22 19:23:26 But if it's too ripe there's no point. It'll just soak up the oil and be all soggy like that
1703 2018-09-22 19:23:23 baby oil dat ass
1704 2018-09-22 19:23:20 Do you know this oil, wealth, money is all yours? and All ppl. if someone steal your phone you gonna be silent & say what I'm gonna do??
1705 2018-09-22 19:23:12 Seeing the backwards shithole that is the arab world crumble once all the oil runs out will be cathartic on a civilizational level.
1706 2018-09-22 19:23:11 Hella mercury and plastic deposits all in the oceans lol oil spills too  yet we supposed to sift through the rest of these fish for a good one 
1707 2018-09-22 19:23:09 the following tasks i did today may seem like ordinary things, but they are accomplishments for me:
oil change, haircut, rolled up some hoses out back, dishes, cleaned room, got gym membership, went shopping, vacuumed room as well, and made a bunch of plans for stuff. it was alot

1710 2018-09-22 19:22:47 The guy at jiffy lube just scolded me for five minutes because I was like 3,000 miles over when I was supposed to get my oil changed or something
1711 2018-09-22 19:22:26 Oil has been subsidized by governments for decades. Now it's time to move those subsidies to EVs. Where is Canada's EV credit???
@JustinTrudeau
1712 2018-09-22 19:22:20 At the moment, it's the only solution. We need to sell our oil. The liberals have fought harder than any other party to get the pipeline through. The pipeline is one thing they are trying their best to get through.
1713 2018-09-22 19:22:13 I buy the oil.
And empty gel capsules and make my own pills..

I take 4 in the am and 4 at night..

2. Olive Oil

3. Avocado Oil
1715 2018-09-22 19:22:04 Brush a pinch of oil with the tea towel, then turn the crème fraîche then mix them out the vinegar.
1716 2018-09-22 19:22:04 The oil jumped and my fucking hand burns
1717 2018-09-22 19:22:01 Get the oil....
1718 2018-09-22 19:21:48 Hmm whatever.. I don't find any difference.. cold water pepper kolamavu kilos of weight.. what was even right in that task? Oil on hand, eggs to stink were good.. I would have bargained with cutting breaking damaging their precious belongings..

1722 2018-09-22 19:21:38 Samir, 

What are your thoughts about the price of crude oil post meeting in Algiers?
1723 2018-09-22 19:21:32 Buy them all for Chris oil I heard he likes a good ick up his arse.....maybe keep the black one for yourself
1724 2018-09-22 19:20:54 This is my 2nd oil change appointment with Conrad’s I’ve had to cancel because they can’t get me in at the time i set. Why even have appointments?
1725 2018-09-22 19:20:28 Saw a commercial for a pizza place where the pepperoni slices were only about as big as quarters. They had curled up and were basically little cups of oil. Yeah, pepperoni is oily, but I don't think anyone wants a pizza where the pepperoni has turned into oil vessels.
1726 2018-09-22 19:20:13 #FreebieFriday Perfect - I use lavender oil to help me sleep, so This is absolutely for me! What about you @PaulMLryde ?
1727 2018-09-22 19:20:12 I thought that was why were there to begin with. You know - corner the opium market, the oil market...
1728 2018-09-22 19:20:01 Have I mentioned how much I love the Smashbox Studio Skin foundation? The shit lasts all day, full coverage af, doesn't settle into my texture/lines, and I literally do NOT oil thru it (when used with my Becca Evermatte primer)
1729 2018-09-22 19:19:56 People please start calling her Professor moonbeam. Or Prof Pickup Truck. 
1730 2018-09-22 19:19:45 The mechanics I go to gave me a discount on my oil change without me knowing ;;!!!! 
1731 2018-09-22 19:19:43 Why don't they learn.cause it's not there families killed,not their oil stolen,not their country's destroyed
1732 2018-09-22 19:19:36 I will say, I kind of like that so many cooking recipes call for the aromatic fish oil, since any fish can be converted into it it actually makes it easy to always have a stock of stat food on hand.
1733 2018-09-22 19:19:35 I swear a bunch of oil & gas industry shills constantly troll Josh

1740 2018-09-22 19:18:48 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1741 2018-09-22 19:17:58 Are you just making things up now? In 1973 many EU nation's were expelling workers from other states because the oil crisis meant they did not have enough jobs for their own people.
1742 2018-09-22 19:17:49 Remember when Todd Graham was a snake oil salesman?
1743 2018-09-22 19:17:36 You are oil
1744 2018-09-22 19:17:31 No sauce at all. Just a little bit of olive oil and salt. The sauce comes from the prawns’ heads
1745 2018-09-22 19:17:29 Are you still sick?  Did you try the listerine or eucalyptus oil in a humidifier?  Wish I could help but all I can do is send you get well wishes.  So please get well and take care of yourself.
1746 2018-09-22 19:17:27 Bio oil ابعدي عنه لاني سمعت ميثه عبدالجليل تقول انو من مكوناته مادة مسرطنه أهم شي رطبي جسمك بأي كريم عندك
1747 2018-09-22 19:17:25 That may be one hell of an irresponsibly reported story, @sarahmccammon.  Report on people volunteering and rescuing hundreds, thousands of people (and pets).  Saying it's possible they did something wrong because why, 'cuz guns 'n stuff!  Any evidence? No, BUT GUNS!!
1748 2018-09-22 19:17:19 @SADcars Do I need to do anything if the car is saying it's time for an oil change? Tried to call the office but can't get through.

1751 2018-09-22 19:16:49 hemp seed oil works as a terrific alternative to traditional omega-3  fatty acid supplements and doesn’t carry the same risk of mercury  ingestion.
1752 2018-09-22 19:16:47 #MilitaryIntervention is an option but this is for citizens of #Venezuela or to capture oil reserves? War is not an option for this kind of problem. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, and more countries are the same before and after the war, maybe worst after the war.
1753 2018-09-22 19:16:44 Yes, but make sure you pat tea tree oil on the area waxed. It helps prevent irritation.
1754 2018-09-22 19:16:42 On Honey or olive oil?
1755 2018-09-22 19:16:33 Organic raw coconut oil works great on skin. I studied holistic remedy for years in school. I'd recommend (not sure if you do) eat organic fruits and vegetables and cut down foods that cause inflammation. That's why acne rises from under skin, kinda like bread.
1756 2018-09-22 19:16:28 Look into CBD oil, i used to get those too very badly
1757 2018-09-22 19:16:26 Approximately 60 tankers move through the Inlet per year. The project would see this number increased to over 400 large crude oil tankers per year
1758 2018-09-22 19:16:17 Hemp seed oil contains essential fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic  acid (DHA), that are required for brain development. DHA is crucial to  the health of the brain as well as the retina of the eye, particularly  in the first year of life.

1779 2018-09-22 19:13:27 Tax breaks and credits, yes.  As are all businesses. Loan guarantees and equity infusions are offered for specific scopes. Eg. New partial upgrading / refining projects in AB to minimize pipeline needs. Not just pumping oil out of the ground.

1796 2018-09-22 19:11:20 The lady that sold it to me told me that her MIL had arthritis so bad it took her 5 minutes to get out of the car! She takes cbd oil twice a day & now she walks around like nothing hurts! Also lowered her blood pressure.
1797 2018-09-22 19:10:53 What convinced me to get a car with a turbo engine? Gas, tires, oil change, every fucking thing is ridiculously high.
1798 2018-09-22 19:10:38 I want a man that’s gone rub vitamin e oil on my stretch marks 
1799 2018-09-22 19:10:34 Any kind of tea tree oil?
1800 2018-09-22 19:10:30 Even though the first episode had the pacing of a snail on an oil spill, and I said I'd drop it, I kinda wanna give "Conspiracy of Silence" a proper chance... and watch all episodes...

1803 2018-09-22 19:10:20 There is nothing I hate more than being a woman in any type of auto body shop situation  like stop tryna sell me stuff I don’t need yet. All my trust issues come up when I have to get oil changes.
1804 2018-09-22 19:10:04 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
1805 2018-09-22 19:09:42 Why wait until your engine blowup to hit me up , when all you needed was an oil change. Hit me up 
1806 2018-09-22 19:09:34 Oregano oil is a dream!! I had a massive sore throat yesterday and today i feel significantly better

1812 2018-09-22 19:08:58 One I specifically remember was on ABC. The cast of Step by Step was talking about Cowboys of M.O.O. Mesa and Patrick Duffy put on a cowboy hat asking if he could pass for a Texas oil baron.
1813 2018-09-22 19:08:57 I just paid 4$ for a oil change  today is dope lol
1814 2018-09-22 19:08:56 basically it’s like fat, oil and steroids in a biological molecule, most of them are insoluble in water
1815 2018-09-22 19:08:47 Half a glass of water, two drops of tea tree oil - shake up and gargle. I’ve an impaired immune system and this sorts out a sore throat, esp if you do it last thing at night. Also good if you’re in germy environments too
1816 2018-09-22 19:08:32 Not to mention all the misinformation against ethanol. A monster oil lobby against ethanol. A public that most days couldnt give a shit. And an ethanol industry/organization/lobby that is not very aggressive or effective. Just another product this country created, gave away to

1821 2018-09-22 19:08:24 Steam your face. Warm (body temp) olive oil on a bit of Cotton wool in your ear... if you get any pain take a paracetamol!
1822 2018-09-22 19:07:59 As the great @howardeskin put it, I’d like to take Kapler’s computer and drop it from the tallest building in Philadelphia. Captain Coconut Oil has failed to hold players accountable.
1823 2018-09-22 19:07:48 Sure. I am on the record many times saying that I believe credit tightening and sanctions affected oil production by making it harder for service companies to keep operating, partners to give credit, Pdvsa to buy diluents in the US, etc.
1824 2018-09-22 19:07:46 With mid terms Trump is going to be pushing for lower prices and I would not be surprised if he threatened strategic petro reserves if oil goes up
1825 2018-09-22 19:07:37 The war was initially on the Western front. Majority of German forces were stationed and engaged there. Most were redeployed to the Eastern Front only after the Allied Invasion began because Hitler desperately needed oil and grains from Ukraine.

1827 2018-09-22 19:07:13 Alternating new shampoos for my dandruff. Tea tree oil one day and coal tar the next. Sometimes I smell like toothpaste and others I smell like a freshly paved road.
1828 2018-09-22 19:06:59 Nope. Not in that amount of oil. It really just allows the ranch and garlic powder to stick
1829 2018-09-22 19:06:48 Hiii @PandaExpress what oils do you cook with? I am allergic to canola oil. Thanks!

1831 2018-09-22 19:06:15 You are so wrong God protects and supplies all his children with their needs ,and we have lots of oil your not the only ones who have it
1832 2018-09-22 19:06:14 When Scotland takes back control of its oil, whisky and all other revenue streams which currently flow South to the WM Gov, not only will the loss of revenue cause major issues but their ability to borrow will also be impacted heavily. That’s why they can’t afford to let us go.
1833 2018-09-22 19:06:04 Just finished discussing the matter with a reliable source and he saying foreign JV partners are developing cold feet sanctioning projects in Nigeria. Ask yourself when last you heard a big oil discovery in Nigerian territory. Oil is a finite resource hence the decline in Qo.
1834 2018-09-22 19:05:48 I think saudi arabia is a foe of europe because they speaked with Algeria in case of  oil producing

1844 2018-09-22 19:03:59 the USD has a limited shelf life, backed by oil, it was fine until light sweet crude peaked circa 2005-2010 but with all the elephantine fields past peak, the thing that holds the USD's value is going away (global warming is helping) China&Russia have huge bullion reserves

1849 2018-09-22 19:02:40 A while ago I found a recipe that doesn't use tomato sauce, just olive oil, cheese, herbs, spices, and toppings.  I love it! Also anything a little spicy like hot banana pepper rings, jalapenos, green chiles.

1851 2018-09-22 19:02:01 they were born 120 years too late to sell snake oil, so fear mongering will have to do
1852 2018-09-22 19:01:53 Except taxpayers had no say in the decision whatsoever. JT broke his election promise to stop oil company subsidies in the process.
1853 2018-09-22 19:01:50 “ima change his oil come on” 
1854 2018-09-22 19:01:43 Right ...yet virtually all policy from this administration has been quite obviously anti-Russian. From sanctions, to Syria strikes, 200 Russian soldiers killed, Iran deal nuked, discussion of US base in Poland, our energy exports, we now lead the world in crude oil production
1855 2018-09-22 19:01:33 The car dealer said i must change the oil every 3 months
What????
My oil not even a change every 9 months but me fe change car oil every 3 months 
1856 2018-09-22 19:01:31 I've mentioned this on the pod before, but here's my beer pretzel recipe. Great for football season.

3/4 cup oil
1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder

1858 2018-09-22 19:01:00 Carbs are definitely a vehicle but it doesn't necessarily make carbohydrates obesogenic.  Take out the seed oil & there should a lot less issue.

1875 2018-09-22 18:58:24 Saturday Field Trip for criminal Ryan Zinke. It's kind of gross to think about what kind of person can sell themselves out to the oil and gas lobbyists knowing he is murdering millions of animals by doing so. Hes a real sicko
1876 2018-09-22 18:58:22 My everyday scent is just out of this world. One banging scent of my perfume for my body, another beard oil scent for my beard, another for my hair and another scent for my face. I can never smell bad.

1878 2018-09-22 18:57:34 it's so good. I don't use oil and it's fine that way. I make mine in the bread machine on "dough" setting because I get bored with kneading, roll/stretch it out, let it rise on my pizza screen (for however long it takes). I bake a little lower than what they say--400, for longer

1895 2018-09-22 18:54:24 brah was telling me u can supplement like RSO and a quarter of a g in a capsule daily for anxiety after trying the oil yesterday i’m SUPER intrigued 
1896 2018-09-22 18:54:18 It's so stupid. We could have been totally green now if oil wasn't promoted for greed in the 50s. Renewables were proposed way back then...
1897 2018-09-22 18:54:16 素論やってる人は人間じゃないので
1898 2018-09-22 18:54:13 why do they call it baby oil. it makes me uncomfortable bc all i can think is someone wringing a baby out and all this oil dripping out of it. disgusting

1901 2018-09-22 18:53:35 80$ for a oil change is outrageous to me. I'm going to start doing my own real soon.
1902 2018-09-22 18:53:21 Just like comparing 25litres of bad oil to 5 litres of good oil
1903 2018-09-22 18:53:16 You going to kill definitely charging females for oil changes

1915 2018-09-22 18:52:01 His tweet is not completely irrelevant. He’s showcasing the hypocrisy of the MANY people out there who are against new pipelines, but are completely and utterly dependent on oil and oil derived products.

1939 2018-09-22 18:48:32 Yes. Very much so. 

I can see why some might fall prey snake oil sales people. Maybe, just maybe, it will work and the snake oil sales person doesn’t outwardly treat me shitty. Dangling hope out there.
1940 2018-09-22 18:48:24 I have Mines toasted with Provolone cheese , ranch , banana peppers ,pickles , a little bit of lettuce  , hot buffalo and mild buffalo salt and pepper oil and vinegar .
1941 2018-09-22 18:48:13 TODAY, THE HIGH-TECH LYNCHING CONTINUES, WITH THE AID OF FAANG PAYPAL TWITTER. #STOPTHEBIAS AND BREAK UP BIG TECH INTO 34 CORPORATIONS LIKE STANDARD OIL !!!
1942 2018-09-22 18:48:10 You are ignoring fracking, renewables, natural gas, wind etc. Plus electric cars and so on. Oil is not the only source of energy. Take your blinders off.
1943 2018-09-22 18:48:08 Every time I go to get my oil changed all the guys talk about is the sticker on the back of my car & I’m always uncomfortable send help
1944 2018-09-22 18:47:52 Dilbit is also very advantageous to our producers. Blending oil is easy and cheap. When you’re selling your product for 1/2 price, you need to find ways to cut costs. 

NOBODY is going to build refineries in Canada anymore. $15B to jump through impossible hoops?
1945 2018-09-22 18:47:44 The mayo melts and becomes oil in which it browns. There's some vinegar notes from it. I know people who roast chickens covered in it. It's actually pretty good.
1946 2018-09-22 18:47:37 My boyfriend got my brakes and oil change done i swear he’s the best
1947 2018-09-22 18:47:35 何十年も後の話になるんですけどねそれに中年太りは好きじゃないので、体を鍛えるか多分中年太りになる前にゆたさんは消滅します。。。。。。
1948 2018-09-22 18:47:32 No one ever cares about the workers. Multiply this scenario times thousands in W Virginia, PA, and In many different industries that used to support a living wage. Anti coal and anti oil becomes anti coal and oil workers. Thousands of families suffer far into the future.
1949 2018-09-22 18:47:29 You are correct. People will not do without energy. They will instead buy Saudi, Indonesian, American, African oil.
And you are delusional. Every liter of oil in that line would be refined to gasoline, diesel etc. Then burned. Instead it will be someone else's oil.
1950 2018-09-22 18:47:19 office, the people get shafted, big money interests get more powerful and there is always another war?

Liberal ideology embraces the scintillating outer layers of globalism but the real agenda is a sinister, corrupted version that benefits the central banks, the oil companies...
1951 2018-09-22 18:47:17 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
1952 2018-09-22 18:46:58 22.5 USD Billion investment by Saudia is more than enough to stabilise us :p Exon mobil is working in Pakistan to make it 6th largest oil producer :D dont worry about us.
1953 2018-09-22 18:46:57 Knew I should have said sesame oil drizzled with soy sauce.
1954 2018-09-22 18:46:56 Due to sports I have no cartilage & x-rays show wearing of the knee bone-on-bone. THC/CBD only works on neurological disorders for pain. I believe in essential oil lotions BUT diet has to play a part in arthritic relief. And weight! If you're on HRT it weakens the bone. Beware!
1955 2018-09-22 18:46:27 Besides transparency in Govt agencies there needs to be a robust plan to grow other sectors of the economy. Right now Nigeria is running on fumes!!! GOD FORBID! WHAT IF OIL PRICES CRASH AGAIN.
1956 2018-09-22 18:46:08 Oops, so sorry, that, hounder of OH, was Jagat Singh, son of Natwar Singh {rightfully removed from @INCIndia for (under UN sanctions) #Iraq Oil Scandal, w/ same hounder son and friend}, But Still tread carefully, for 2/3rd Majority

1962 2018-09-22 18:45:20 my parents blend their coffee with coconut oil - same benefits as butter, but if you do it with a hand mixer the texture is more like a coconut latte.

1966 2018-09-22 18:44:54 Always difficult  trying to get the greens to understand us I find, to be honest
1967 2018-09-22 18:44:43 Henry Ford. His mass-production Of autos really shaped American domestic and foreign policy since. Or John D. Rockefeller, who birthed the American oil industry — and by extension the auto industry.
1968 2018-09-22 18:44:38 Still see a few but it's worth a try as they fucking big bastard now and I can't stand got peppermint oil down as well and cedar balls  I will try anything to keep the fuckers out

1978 2018-09-22 18:43:11 The plan is to sell all the oil and mineral rights to my buddies in order to line the pockets with cash... er.. I mean.. "fix up the parks"...  Yeah. Yeah.  That's the ticket.
1979 2018-09-22 18:43:08 Not enough gorp!

1984 2018-09-22 18:42:45 I watched the debate between Beto and Ted. How many times did Ted mention Hillary Clinton? Sad!  Ted had an ill fitting suit on - looked like a snake oil salesmen. Pathetic. #BetoForSenate

1994 2018-09-22 18:41:58 My car a soldier. Ain’t no hoe in his oil lol
1995 2018-09-22 18:41:53 You are spot on! & to add to this most of Nigeria’s JV partners (Shell, Exxon, Chevron) are allocating more capital towards the more profitable short term shale (unconventional ) oil production in the US.
1996 2018-09-22 18:41:52 I just bought a cool new shoes  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1997 2018-09-22 18:41:52 Look at the 1st tweet: it's about amount of oil being transported thru cdn waters. Where r the protesters? U keep stating your ideological points but accuse me of doing that, yet u don't answer the question. Clearly u can't. And there r many more valid pts than that one
1998 2018-09-22 18:41:50 but I bet there is a snake oil for your high BP 
1999 2018-09-22 18:41:47 I have washed many pelicans with Dawn. It gets the oil off the birds but a couple of days volunteering is tough on human skin. We learned to rinse well.

2006 2018-09-22 18:40:59 5) dangerous & destructive direction. Should this happen, many countries around the world will suffer in different terms, whether by influx of refugees, terrorist attacks, shortage of oil & gas, high price of oil & gas, interruption in transport of goods, etc etc. No matter,

2010 2018-09-22 18:40:40 The guys at Valvoline always make me feel like a supermodel when I go to get my oil changed - 10/10 would recommend

2012 2018-09-22 18:40:25 たらこって美味いよな！
2013 2018-09-22 18:40:24 My question is what happens if China exchanges those USD for oil? Would that not create inflation and rising yields? Gold can always be recirculated, but once oil is used, it's gone.
2014 2018-09-22 18:40:20 え、すでに中年太りなのでわw
2015 2018-09-22 18:40:15 Yes..and am curious about the cooking oil..... Over 100 containers that are stationed at Port side cfs owned by Joho.... Why.... What's not happening...investigate investigate
2016 2018-09-22 18:40:12 #abpoli I am sure they believe in climate change. Just not in sacrificing the Alberta economy on the alter of mere virtue signalling to a world that will run out of oil in 150 yrs and from a country that sinks more CO2 than the 2% of world output it produces.

2023 2018-09-22 18:39:19 It's okay, it was odd to see his tweet in my notifications, but when I clicked on it, his whole TL was gone.

These cowards are such idiots. Making fun of a tweet about where oil comes from, but then getting in their car for a single loaf of bread, 5 miles away.

2056 2018-09-22 18:35:00 Well at least we are taking care of ourselves.  Unlike Obama, who gave money to Mexico, and  South American countries to drill for oil and keep the profits.  Let’s not forget, that’s the socialist way!  You need to start working for your country!

2074 2018-09-22 18:32:50 Cheesy grits, heavy cream a mix of gruyere and white cheddar. Collard greens pressure cooked with veg stock ham hocks, Tasso, and tons of garlic. Chicken thigh skins cut into strips and fried in veg oil, toss in a paper bag with cayenne and s/p. Sorry for the delay @Robboman
2075 2018-09-22 18:32:48 Soya mune zvese Soya Milk Soya Flour Cooking oil and a lot of other extracts. It's highly profitable and u can have two crops per year. Government seriously needs to craft a Soya education campaign
2076 2018-09-22 18:32:48 I mean, generally speaking, one does not wage jihad in the name of Halliburton. Although, there could be a part of the Bible or Koran that talks about oil prices that I missed.
2077 2018-09-22 18:32:44 If you want to get rid of dark spots naturally without spending a whole lot of money listen to me when I tell you almond oil and shea butter is the answer!
2078 2018-09-22 18:32:23 I am astounded as to how all the major political parties are so nervous about exposing corrupt oil and gas companies. They feel no empathy with the many that had their lives wrecked.. Makes me wonder if voting has any real significance

2088 2018-09-22 18:30:58 Debating trying CBD oil for my anxiety hmmm 
2089 2018-09-22 18:30:55 The cost to the US consumer is very high... but the earnings for the Oil companies is pretty nice... they were very close to having to cut the dividend... saved just in time!
2090 2018-09-22 18:30:53 Everyone who follows this snake oil salesman is complicit.
2091 2018-09-22 18:30:50 snake oil
2092 2018-09-22 18:30:48 Why that's an unacceptable situation, I would recommend some lightly scented massage oil rubbed in lovingly with my face! 
2093 2018-09-22 18:30:46 An angry, mysterious orb made of oil paint that was once a human being just like you.
2094 2018-09-22 18:30:43 at home cooking vegetables eating bread with olive oil literally any man who I even look at is fucking blessed
2095 2018-09-22 18:30:35 aku rasa HL oil in lotion ni tak sesuai dgn kulit aku  semalam pakai pastu harini mcm ada naik jerawat seketul. tapi tak sure lagi sbb takut hormonal acne ja  takpalah tgk lah esok lusa kalau pakai lagi sekali and keluar jerawat, that's is, I'm gonna sell that little demon.
2096 2018-09-22 18:30:25 Agreeing Trump standing up to left is encouraging , but real hatred is his Support of Nationalism ! Democrat policy is in line with European Union of Globalization! ( like trying to mix Oil & Water , it want Work) Personal Freedoms are at Risk!
2097 2018-09-22 18:30:22 I won't let any member of my family enlist and be sent to some damned desert to be killed in the Republicans' Blood for OIL wars that have cost us lives and money that only make the republicans wealthier.  Did your evil Corrupt Daddy go to war?   IT HAS TO STOP.
2098 2018-09-22 18:30:10 Nah... That is what the Govt wants you to believe... Read the other articles as well.... 
This is Just how they say excise duty on fuel goes to pay for oil bonds. Where actually just 6% goes to pay it.
2099 2018-09-22 18:30:02 I want a Potbelly sandwich on flat bread, extra oil, please.

2103 2018-09-22 18:29:50 What's your source? @TheTalkCBS stated weed not CBD oil.
2104 2018-09-22 18:29:48 You forgot freezing cold night at bangers with the smell of burning rubber and oil 
2105 2018-09-22 18:29:39 “My name is Jeffery Jackson. I run Jackson Refineries. An oil conglomerate in town. I am a billionaire. But the money doesn’t come from the oil. It comes from the drugs that are run through the cartel that is operated overseas by men far more dangerous than me. Are you happy?”
2106 2018-09-22 18:29:35 We don't forget. We bury it. I have PTSD, and I am triggered by the strangest things. Barbury bushes, black sneakers, and the smell of motor oil trigger panic attacks and I can't even recall those things having anything to do with the attack. I recall the brutal violence
2107 2018-09-22 18:29:31 You can drink a tea or even tbspoon of olive oil on an empty stomach (I never tried) or castor oil, it works within 1-2 hours and it is great. I never had problems with it.
2108 2018-09-22 18:29:29 There will be no hit. You will outlaw cars when they need an oil change and new ones sold... Many other factors... like top heavy news orgs with bad intel.
2109 2018-09-22 18:29:15 Join a sorority so that you have a sister who comes w her boyfriend to change the oil in your car bc you have no money omg
2110 2018-09-22 18:29:00 Getting lunch ready for when my husband gets home. Trying to find vegetable oil. Can’t find it but I found a huge bottle of kaluha!! So went to wesco- no oil. But they did have vodka. And milk. It’s a White Russian kinda day!
2111 2018-09-22 18:28:51 Loud it for people at the back
2112 2018-09-22 18:28:35 I won't argue your last point however, subsidies have been used to shift markets and empower national infrastructure in the past. Rail, telephone, tar sand oil, Bombardier, Chrysler and GM...the list goes on.
2113 2018-09-22 18:28:14 Well my oil isn’t going to change it’s self 
2114 2018-09-22 18:28:12 Everytime someone ask for a price on how much renz would charge em to fix their car or like an oil change he’ll give them a price and if I feel like he didn’t charge them enough I’ll bump up the price.

2118 2018-09-22 18:27:06 Oh, I dunno.. if I had to guess I'd say right about the time Bill Clinton raped his 854363343 victim..
2119 2018-09-22 18:26:38 Data is the new oil
2120 2018-09-22 18:26:37 When the oil runs out or more likely when   have control of the world's oil production bc their military depend on it therefore selling at exorbitant prices to pay for the elite's lust for war then there's a good chance that parts of the planet will be back in the Stone Age
2121 2018-09-22 18:26:29 Let’s see some facts on that oil & gas welfare claims.
2122 2018-09-22 18:26:27 I wish y’all knew what the oil lobbyists do
2123 2018-09-22 18:26:23 Who says we dictate the price ? Please tell us why were you on the streets with LPG cylinder,utensils,stove and vegetables running a mock kitchen in 2013 protesting against fuel price which was lower than today's despite oil traded @ USD 145 then as against 79 today ?

2127 2018-09-22 18:25:26 Taught my gf how to change her car oil so she is one more step closer to not needing me anymore
2128 2018-09-22 18:25:26 Any nigga that forms for his fellow geez is a slay queen and has broken the bro code
2129 2018-09-22 18:25:21 @jcsosazpurua en Cristiano.. Para recuperar, qué hacer con 120.000 seres en PDVSA..? Y con Activos..? Recuperarlos o reemplazarlos.? Quien produciria y venderia Oil&Gas y Gasolina en Vzla..? El Edo, Mixtas o Privadas..?
2130 2018-09-22 18:25:20 @DallonWeekes do you have any boiled linseed oil? i can't fit this whole cucumber in my asshole dry
2131 2018-09-22 18:25:07 Guys STOP attacking each other. According to statistics, we don't have enough to move this country forward. Don't let any politician  come and deceive us again. If, we can't  grow our food, refined oil, generate electricity by ourselves, we are going nowhere.
2132 2018-09-22 18:25:05 He should have ended that with "thanks for playing, bitches" and a cocaine mic drop
2133 2018-09-22 18:24:38 If the government works for oil, and the government also works for the people, than oil work's for me. Correct?
2134 2018-09-22 18:24:17 I was shopping for motor oil recently, I saw on the shelf Pennzoil motor oil. I remember years ago when Pennzoil screwed over Texaco out of billions over some Texas law. I have never knowingly bought Pennzoil since
2135 2018-09-22 18:24:05 I'm brushing my nephew hair using the castor oil, he talking bou 'this oil stink'
2136 2018-09-22 18:24:05 Plus we discovered a way to fit more oil on water fowls...
2137 2018-09-22 18:23:43 The higher oil prices go, the better solar energy and electric cars, trucks and busses look.
2138 2018-09-22 18:23:36 @CFR_org Then from Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Bahrain, Jordan and Houthi Yemen, Hezbollah leads invasion of Kingdom. The Shia reclaim the Pilgramage and the west controls the oil fields with Hez and their partners in Tehran getting a cut. Iran has moved beyond their 1979 zeal.
2139 2018-09-22 18:23:25 Easy big guy, he's 'the realist'.
2140 2018-09-22 18:23:10 Hot compress? Tea bag? Tweezers? Tea tree oil?
2141 2018-09-22 18:23:06 when your headache doesn't even listen to axe oil..
2142 2018-09-22 18:23:05 Ada sesiapa nak letgo muji cleansing oil ? Yang sensitive series. Taknak yang mild series. @twt_kecantikann #tanyaTK
2143 2018-09-22 18:22:57 Some at 22%. When interest rates went down knew people who bought another house at lower interest rate & told bank to come get their old one. In the oil town I lived in was told people burned their furniture on the street because they couldn't afford to move it. Good old days.
2144 2018-09-22 18:22:56 OMG Graziano, I wonder if he could pop round as I need to oil the chain on my bike #SCD
2145 2018-09-22 18:22:52 they have everything iirc. drops edibles and oil
2146 2018-09-22 18:22:49 Cocaine Mitch is one Savage MoFo.. I hope he stays around! And Lindsey Graham too, well as long as Lindsey Graham keeps doing Mitchs cocaine.
2147 2018-09-22 18:22:44 I’m in line to get an oil change. There is a taco place right next door. How can there not be a tweet coming from this?

2153 2018-09-22 18:22:04 My oil is supposed to look a certain way too???  I can honestly say I’ve never looked at oil in my life
2154 2018-09-22 18:21:49 That way reducing capital risk.. while improving the agriculture Industry. There is lot of opportunities in the castor oil industry but need coordination by government and private sector (funding agencies).
2155 2018-09-22 18:21:43 Y’all probably put trans oil in my shit n fuck it all up for $20
2156 2018-09-22 18:21:38 Oh I'm hardly disparaging coconut oil. I cook almost everything in it and even add a splash to my coffee every morning. Great for MCTs. I was referring to the pre-bottled garbage we get here on the mainland that some people think is healthy. Might as well be Koolaid. 
2157 2018-09-22 18:21:33 past the over change  buy the groupon and go get an oil change lmao
2158 2018-09-22 18:21:23 Wow, the oil companies admitting this!

2163 2018-09-22 18:20:09 I guess we can start with oil companies own research from the 80’s and 90’s of how burning their product would warm the planet. What? You don’t trust the oil industry’s own science? Thought the private sector knew their shit?
2164 2018-09-22 18:20:02 I don’t wanna hear nothing about what I need , or what’s wrong with my car. Change the oil so I can go

2170 2018-09-22 18:19:01 A popular folk myth in the west - despite Justin Trudeau buying a pipeline to keep the goal of oil to tidewater alive.  BTW - If Alberta had worked with the NEP - by today, it would have been selling to tidewater for decades & have a Heritage Fund bigger than Norway.   #cdnpoli
2171 2018-09-22 18:19:00 Govt for the oil barons, by the oil barons.

2174 2018-09-22 18:18:49 The secret is heat the pan up hot with no oil-then add oil to heat up. Your eggs won’t stick after that.
2175 2018-09-22 18:18:45 These ppl at the honda dealership always tryna get u. I went for an oil change dude gonna say i need my tires rotated. Niggaaa these r Brand New tires they havent even been on my car a month! Try again

2178 2018-09-22 18:18:19 The thing is that the years just collapse into the years in this country, and we never really take anything seriously. An older friend was telling me that the chorus of 'diversify the economy from oil' was already being sung when he graduated university. In 1991.
2179 2018-09-22 18:18:14 Oil change and tire rotation and balance
2180 2018-09-22 18:18:13 Started mixing tea tree oil into the lotion i use on my face and YALL my face has like NOOOOO flakes or dry patches AT ALL

2182 2018-09-22 18:18:07 Does Russia have the liquidity to pull off something like that? Oil price is still in the 70s.
2183 2018-09-22 18:18:04 I hope that big mark that hot oil left on my skin disappears.

2188 2018-09-22 18:16:59 56 reasons to kick out BJP:

1. Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public.
2189 2018-09-22 18:16:57 Me: *goes to get oil changed* 
Dude: *cant drive my car cause it’s manual*

2194 2018-09-22 18:16:22 Its not always like 50-50 like "you can't do this ,THEREFORE you are not this". Both are Goats on their own fields. They way you say it is like saying "hah,this graffiti artist can't oil paint and calls himself an artist". Please,NO.
2195 2018-09-22 18:16:18 Every major industry, including agriculture and oil, required our tax dollars. Although you can make arguments that the previous government took liberties and other countries aren't doing their share, you can't argue renewable are the future and our environment is in trouble
2196 2018-09-22 18:16:15 Of the 2 million barrels of oil a day that we produce in the average, Nigeria only owns 60%. Lets be guided please. We still haven’t realised that this country is broke. We have been for a long time
2197 2018-09-22 18:16:14 Narrator: Define kleptocracy in 6 words or less.

Ryan Zinke to oil and gas industry: Our government should work for you.

2202 2018-09-22 18:15:29 That because you people believe what they tell you guys on tv. We in the Caribbean use coconut because we like the oil on our hair and skin and drink coconut water if we come up a green one. No one picks or buy them and store it at home
2203 2018-09-22 18:15:28 i grease my pro controller thoroughly with coconut oil and apply a generous layer of uv curing resin

2213 2018-09-22 18:14:26 The contractors' wallets aren't fat enough is the reason, plus OIL!
2214 2018-09-22 18:14:04 The discussion if developed countries would be dependent of oil producing states with a shady reputation on human rights, terrorism & democracy is a different one & needs to be politically addressed. The fact you mention CO2 in the same tweet implies you have absolutely no clue.
2215 2018-09-22 18:14:04 I keep burping up krill oil, not pleasant

2217 2018-09-22 18:13:47 The next Texas Senatorial debate should be a Gen-X playlist showdown. Beto opens up with Midnight Oil, Cruz counters with Amy Grant. Beto jams out to Mother Love Bone, Cruz sways by himself in a corner to a Color Me Badd love ballad.

2223 2018-09-22 18:13:08 Housing (renters rights, guaranteed housing, foreign investment, sitting on empty property). Traffic in major cities => public transportation. Removing power from real estate lobbies. Removing power from oil companies.
2224 2018-09-22 18:13:05 but wine and oil and wheat - don't think we need those!
2225 2018-09-22 18:13:05 Trump’s Trade War and walking away from the Iran Deal has been great for Russia! It’s forced China and Russia to forge new close ties. It’s led Saudis and OPEC to work with Russia to increase oil production and make more profit. It’s forced EU into building gas line from Russia!
2226 2018-09-22 18:13:04 And sorry people are tired of seeing exhibitions on pyramids and mummies. But ya know without proper representation we continue to pay out the wahzoo for the same oil painting that some white person’s ancestors stole from a marginalized group during colonization.

2229 2018-09-22 18:12:59 How much could Utah indefinately increase our tourism income by radically investing in our Parks instead of opening them up to mining and oil?
2230 2018-09-22 18:12:58 He’s a part time professor, and a full time small business owner.  Unlike @SenMcGarrigle who’s a full time republican hack posing in his garage like he’s changing oil every day in his ads.  #resist #factsmatter #BlueWave2018
2231 2018-09-22 18:12:53 It looks like an amazing loaf of bread tbh. I'd love some with extra virgin olive oil & balsamic vinegar...
2232 2018-09-22 18:12:44 Oh yeah he has a warranty for repairs and free oil changes that's nontransferrable anyway so

Like what were we thinking lmao
2233 2018-09-22 18:12:15 You mistake Christians with these right-wing evangelical christian crazies. Christians in America don't need to reboot. They need to speak up and stop being shouted down by these snake oil salesmen. They need to turn over some tables.

2237 2018-09-22 18:11:56 So weak BJP govt that they cannot fix oil prices in international market. UPA used to do this every day, they had such big power.

What use is 56 if only mean to fill banyan?
2238 2018-09-22 18:11:55 I read that U.S produced oil is a dirtier grade and cost too much to refine here.  Also read it cost up to 75$ a barrel to extract it here so it's cheaper to import some from other countries. Probably some BS so more middlemen can get their cuts and profit more..
2239 2018-09-22 18:11:34 @DocWallach @drjoshaxe Curious what your thoughts are regarding MCT oil vs butter? I have been using MCT in my coffee to heal gut  and otherwise only cooking with butter.  Youngevity  protocol say absolutely no oil.  Loving my mighty 90 supplements!

2244 2018-09-22 18:11:03 The Light sweet crude oil that we import from the US in the East requires less energy to refine and sells for a better price. WCS discount for the bitumen we export to the US from the West is the need for transportation given the refinery locations, most of which are in the Gulf.
2245 2018-09-22 18:10:56 These niggas tryna charge me 64.99 for an oil change. I must got stupid on my forehead or sum

2253 2018-09-22 18:09:54 "In 2021-22 another oil shock is coming. We need to be ready. brace yourselves." A dark and dire warning of tougher times ahead for our nation if we continue with our half measure initiatives. If only our policy makers would listen to voice of reason.....
2254 2018-09-22 18:09:52 Will almost pay for the $3B in annual industry subsidies and the $46B in downstream costs oil causes Canadians to pay.Not pay the $200B in abandoned well cleanup. No profit until 2020?Renewables start generating profit immediately. As a first world country we should be an example

2260 2018-09-22 18:09:37 You know what, they didn't want to believe removing regulations would help open up the free market, expand or GDP and free up our energy market. This help fill in the gap of the Iran oil sanctions, which was all in place before we even put sanctions on Iran. Facts scare Dems.

2264 2018-09-22 18:08:44 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
2265 2018-09-22 18:08:23 it works really well actually for oil control & it doesn’t look bad or cakey! & those pores are vanished after guurl hahaha
2266 2018-09-22 18:08:22 I would decide to get an oil change while I’m starving. 
2267 2018-09-22 18:08:11 He is also delirious. Efflin, Pivetta and valasquez barely made starts thru the 5-6 innings. Why Klentak didn’t add Happ and/or Hamels at break for a couple of farmers is a major blunder. Starting pitching was starting to leak oil. Look at the film...

2277 2018-09-22 18:06:24 3 @Walmart employees available to do the oil change on my car; 1 actually working, 1 is admiring the low mileage on my car & the other is holding up the fence at the Morgantown,PA location.
45 minutes for an oil change. #SMH
2278 2018-09-22 18:06:22 How could anyone support Ted Cruz? He’s sleazier than a snake oil salesman at a strip joint. But that’s the state of the GOP. The life of a black man minding his own business means less than a white cop’s job.
2279 2018-09-22 18:05:52 Anyone know a good public policy open mic? I have a 3 minute oil nationalization proposal I wanna test out.

2281 2018-09-22 18:05:47 I got this new deodorant and I smell fuckin gooooood. I keep smelling it and remembering that it’s me. Vegan, organic, fair trade w hemp oil in it. Worth all $6 it cost me! 
2282 2018-09-22 18:05:45 Cut like this or into trad chip shape. Soak for 45mins to remove some starch. Dry really well. Paprika and a light coating of oil. On baking parchment in a 210c to get crisp. Salt at the end.
2283 2018-09-22 18:05:42 Oil has still not lost its importance and muslim countries need to realise the fact that they need not be exploited
2284 2018-09-22 18:05:18 Hunter is a waste but has a big contract. Relief pitchers thrive in defined roles, which none of them have thanks to Captain Coconut Oil
2285 2018-09-22 18:05:17 I’m not sure how much confidence I place in the “wine, oil, and wheat” part.
2286 2018-09-22 18:05:15 Yes, what the hell, tearing up the interior while there is a glut of oil and gas prices keep going up anyway. Up a dollar here since Trump took office.
2287 2018-09-22 18:05:15 Was that supposed to be part of the calling card for one Kris Russell?
2288 2018-09-22 18:05:05 It's like Frankie Five Angels suddenly remembering that he had once been in the olive oil business with Vito Corleone.

2290 2018-09-22 18:04:59 People seem to miss how predatory this marketing and sales is. Selling people the cheapest crap possible at an insane mark up. It’s snake oil. It’s hurting people. Meanwhile people are avoiding processed meats like the plague. It’s insanity.
2291 2018-09-22 18:04:53 Today, I bought beard oil today and have been tweaking the sound settings on my phonograph set up. Am... am I a hipster??
2292 2018-09-22 18:04:24 Cooking oil is as little as 3.59 dollars
2293 2018-09-22 18:04:20 Wow. Looks like an oil painting. Waking early has its rewards.
2294 2018-09-22 18:03:55 he looks like he's been dipped in olive oil. not an attractive look
2295 2018-09-22 18:03:23 Probably one with a hentai theme to it.
2296 2018-09-22 18:03:17 Hii ni nzuri kuliko majaketi maana kila abiria wapewe kichupa cha oil wakae nacho mfukoni
2297 2018-09-22 18:03:17 I had a client referred to me from a publicly funded programme for business advice some years back. She was a "Reiki & Essential Oil Massage Practitioner" who, it turned out, had exactly that sort of waiting area, & guaranteed her customers a "happy ending". 
2298 2018-09-22 18:03:06 Graziano is more oil slick than man #Strictly #scd
2299 2018-09-22 18:03:03 Nigeria has a revenue problem, not a spending one. For a country which collects next to nothing in taxes once oil royalties are excluded, there needs to be a greater tax drive. 

What I find interesting is how many ppl are saying FG shd cut spending (on services they don't use).
2300 2018-09-22 18:02:48 Graziano looks like he's been dipped in oil  #Strictly
2301 2018-09-22 18:02:26 I think this may be the way to my children’s hearts ... just oil and salt?
2302 2018-09-22 18:02:16 Good. Now payback for the U.S. as its production skyrockets and potentially to become net oil exporter ? To be a geopolitical influencer
2303 2018-09-22 18:02:08 Not yet. But I'm on vaca this next week, so I'll handle it by going to bed and sipping on the bone broth I picked up. In the meantime, I'm up to my neck in avocados, olive oil, and lamb chops.
2304 2018-09-22 18:02:02 what do you think about coconut oil? or grapeseed oil? those 2 have worked wonders for me 
2305 2018-09-22 18:01:58 @narendramodi and @dpradhanbjp kyo mera khoon choos rahe ho daily? 
so many times u increased tax on fuel while crude oil price falling down. But now waht. no reduction in taxes to control higher rate of oil.

2307 2018-09-22 18:01:55 I wasted $4 on some almond milk ice cream because it was one of the cheapest pints at whole foods, and this fucker has coconut oil in it. I hate coconut that as soon as I tasted a small fleck I knew something was off. I tried a little more and I only taste coconut.

Willing to help the Communist Party of China repress people but unwilling to take on projects from the United States Department of Defense.  Pathetic.
2327 2018-09-22 17:59:10 I think oil will eventually break above those levels...It will be in fits and starts but the supply situation will tighten into year end...Most likely 75 - 80 for WTI and 90 for Brent are more realistic targets.

2332 2018-09-22 17:58:46 Rub palm oil should help. But next time before you do anything fresh pepper put some groundnut oil on your fingers. When you wash it off, there won't be any pepper at all. You welcome in advance.
2333 2018-09-22 17:58:44 The trouble with Mr Potato head is technically I've just rubbed Him in olive oil, covered him in herbs, cooked him slowly, cut him open, stuffed him with cheese and ate the poor fella.
2334 2018-09-22 17:58:38 He turned back regs on oil and gas industry, hence my job. And now I have insurance that Obummer took away. More people are working, hence less on WELFARE!  Interest rates are up a bit. The economy is doing MUCH BETTER.
2335 2018-09-22 17:58:33 I don’t. Most of them have coconut oil which is highly comedogenic which is a red flag for me, but there are definitely people who love them.
2336 2018-09-22 17:58:16 When I do paint I use acrylic paints simply because I don’t have the patience to wait for oil paints to dry

2358 2018-09-22 17:55:21 my understanding of oils which I rarely buy anymore is fragrance oil does not have to be natural scents, essential oils is supposed to be as described on label or description,
2359 2018-09-22 17:55:20 Of course they didn’t because it doesn’t fit their playbook.  This is all a setup
2360 2018-09-22 17:55:13 don’t feel like sitting at Walmart for ten years while they change my oil 
2361 2018-09-22 17:55:10 I would think that generally, an oil-free surface would be grippier than ones with oil.  But I’m no physicist.

2369 2018-09-22 17:53:28 Oklahoma lost their heisman and their offense is still a fine oil machine. Louisville lost their heisman and their offense has gone into the toilet. That’s on COACHING.
2370 2018-09-22 17:53:22 Not sure - at all - that demand destruction will happen at 90 USD... to double the problem, most of the new coming oil (US shale) comes with an unsuitable API for the biggest part of the demand! End 2019 will be very very complicated...
2371 2018-09-22 17:53:18 Also, I read somewhere that Liaquat Ali Khan was murdered by CIA for some oil deal. Not sure how true.
2372 2018-09-22 17:53:09 Yeah.. Mangalore the costal Karnataka people use coconut & coconut oil is like must..

2377 2018-09-22 17:52:27 Well crap, I'm at the Subaru dealer getting my oil changed and see the oil that has leaked down from the head gasket. A new one is possible but pretty expensive. Hopefully won't cut into the fursuit budget too bad though. Gotta fix it. Loan please?

2380 2018-09-22 17:52:08 OIC was specifically more attractive in 70s because of the concentration and control it had on the oil market. And the US was eyeing the oil considering it had had the taste of profits being driven from it specifically btw ww1 and ww2 through trade with japan.

2382 2018-09-22 17:52:04 HL cuma ada 1 cleansing oil. Oil in Lotion tu toner
2383 2018-09-22 17:52:02 ...lots of oil in that water.  Roosevelt knew and let it happen.
2384 2018-09-22 17:51:55 Also, weed makes me psychotic, telling someone to think positive is shaming & tone policing, and coconut oil is a saturated fat the cultivation of which destroys the environment. 

I get mega peeved at folks & their “solutions”.
2385 2018-09-22 17:51:51 Now we're running a brothel? Ohhhhhh an *actual* oil change
2386 2018-09-22 17:51:28 We'd both be idiots if it wasn't difficult to say "bituminous sands".  Neither "oil sands", nor "tar sands" is entirely accurate.  This stuff is thick and needs to be upgraded to synthetic crude.  This means higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil from elsewhere.
2387 2018-09-22 17:51:16 What set me off was your assertion that all alcohol is just poison. I remember a few years back the oldest woman on Earth was French and she said she has olive oil and red wine every day, and she was 122. French and Italian life expectancies are high, they all drink red wine.
2388 2018-09-22 17:51:09 mimi got me on this body oil shit 
2389 2018-09-22 17:51:06 Mobilised on seven seas cod liver oil and Zimmer frames!
2390 2018-09-22 17:50:53 I always feel like I have done such a good deed when I get the oil changed in my car. LOL
2391 2018-09-22 17:50:51 Just saw your response to another post about CBD oil. God bless her abundantly, and I pray that He will bring restoration, healing and swift recovery to your precious grandmother.
2392 2018-09-22 17:50:50 Seconded
2393 2018-09-22 17:50:38 Did Midnight Oil have a song about the Zodiac Killer? Ha!
2394 2018-09-22 17:50:18 We are coming to town tomorrow, to deliver our daughter to uni at Bath Spa - we can bring emergency supplies of Balsamic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and orzo, if needed.  And gin.  My daughter brings much gin to Bath!
2395 2018-09-22 17:50:10 Ok wow. I can’t even begin to imagine how morally bankrupt you have to be to say something like this.
2396 2018-09-22 17:50:09 I paid $63 for an oil change 
2397 2018-09-22 17:50:07 You're like a diamond and I'm like glass, like oil and water we always clash.
2398 2018-09-22 17:49:59 Hi, hope you're well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you. When can I be at your service?
2399 2018-09-22 17:49:57 Pls what is my state? I cant & wont until we operate a truly federal system when every state is fiscally responsible for itself. Oil money from my state is being shared to 35 others, some are wasting it & ur here saying 'mind my business'! Btw my state isnt owing
2400 2018-09-22 17:49:56 If people would read the WSJ or even the financial times they would get this. "The price of oil in the US has risen only modestly while gasoline prices have essentially remained flat. The current global oil price around $80 a barrel, $60 below the highs of a decade ago". 
2401 2018-09-22 17:49:54 Yeah we have. He is a snake oil salesman.
2402 2018-09-22 17:49:51 Skin oil would make it less grippy?

2407 2018-09-22 17:49:05 Even if oil tanker traffic increases by a tanker ship a day, the tankers are protected. They now have two hulls rather than one to prevent leaks in a crash.  Spill risk is nearly zero. This is more BS from First Nations and conservationist who know zero.
2408 2018-09-22 17:49:04 Once the social problems begin to impact a little more (perhaps aided by an impending financial crash) on those other than the poorest? Perhaps, but the Swedish politicial oil tanker can only turn very slowly due to the social mores which the Elite exploit to maxium effect!
2409 2018-09-22 17:48:58 Oh. Like an oil change?
2410 2018-09-22 17:48:52 Wait which 19,800 today is just 22nd
2411 2018-09-22 17:48:51 Not in drilling or fracking. But the oil industry, pipeline, storage and refining.
2412 2018-09-22 17:48:47 To all my niggas ..... if ya girl freshly getting out the shower and she put lotion or baby oil on her knees and legs before her face she definitely a Hoe 
2413 2018-09-22 17:48:43 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
2414 2018-09-22 17:48:39 i thought zzt said he can cook asiohgosdj how does he not know you have to heat up the pan before putting oil
2415 2018-09-22 17:48:33 @realDonaldTrump Russia and Iran are both producers that we greatly curtail purchases of oil products from.    Russia has been the #1 producer.   However, their fields are being depleted and their production will soon start to drop as recovery gets more difficult for them
2416 2018-09-22 17:48:31 Bella Naija will have you thinking your gonna marry one oil tycoon, when it's really Chukwudi from computer village repairing tecno phones .
2417 2018-09-22 17:48:26 Thank you Jesus, for tea tree oil.
2418 2018-09-22 17:48:13 In the late 1800s, Standard Oil took control of about 90 percent of the nation’s refineries as well as most of the processing and transportation. The U.S. Supreme Court in May 1911 found Standard Oil had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and ordered corporation to dissolve.
2419 2018-09-22 17:48:09 If an oil could come between us, were we ever really friends to begin with?
2420 2018-09-22 17:48:06 We have no slaves despite many Remainers calling for the import of cheap labour with a strangely neo-colonial attitudes. The economy is oil based and semi post industrial and not agricultural.  But the comparison is interesting.

2422 2018-09-22 17:47:49 Send me to gitmo too... Jonathan Ward and Icon have done a lot of awesome (and holy shit $$$) electric and ICE customs. Kudos to them for figuring out how to exploit yuppie demand. Viva capitalism!

2425 2018-09-22 17:47:37 Dang. You sure it’s a piston leak and not oil dripping from up above? If it’s a leak in your caliper you may need a new caliper.
2426 2018-09-22 17:47:31 I've seen so many electric cars with plates mocking oil etc. If I get an electric car my plate will be "coal car"  even if the state no longer has coal power plants by that time.
2427 2018-09-22 17:47:28 Lol I originally made my oil change appt for the wrong Maguire then I ended up at another different one cause they’re on the same street but they already took me in here so I guess it works out. Only me..

2438 2018-09-22 17:46:04 @realDonaldTrump 
Part of the issue on oil prices is our greatly increased production of oil from Shale.  Our increased output puts brakes on higher prices.
All OPEC can do is to choose how much oil to pump into the market.
Russia produces alot but generally that is off limits
2439 2018-09-22 17:46:01 No oil in the water. Stevens going to do it himself I think. Don’t want to wang another £1500 in labour at it. I’ll update when he gets round to it!

2442 2018-09-22 17:44:52 In terms of the details, everyone has their own theories on ideal oven temp, cooking time, cooling process, and oil types. Very little, AFAIK, has been conclusively proven.
2443 2018-09-22 17:44:48 I swear people that come in to get oil changes come in groups of 4 all the time
2444 2018-09-22 17:44:39 It’s great here - a fine Saturday and i’m at Jeep dealership behind 5 people getting an oil change!!!
2445 2018-09-22 17:44:39 A good time to remind people to take the opportunity to appreciate our public lands. Something Trump does not want us to do. He wants to sell our lands out from under us to oil, gas, uranium, lumber and metal and mineral corporations! Getting $ kickbacks for himself and his kids!
2446 2018-09-22 17:44:30 Look CPEC is a game changer for China not Pakistan. Even though Pak thinks it can become (like Dubai with it's oil money) a trade hub but they don't understand about sustainable economy and CPEC won't be successful without India so let Pak go bankrupt first,then we will think.
2447 2018-09-22 17:44:29 They currently are doing that now by that logic. They allow single hulled barges daily for Vancouver island which would grind to a halt without them. Vancouver exports US coal daily from its port. Vancouver imports oil and gas daily by tanker to satisfy its needs.

2458 2018-09-22 17:42:58 Well until the head is off it’ll remain a mystery I guess. Was there any oil in the coolant? Good compression would indicate fault free valves.
Even if the head is warped/knackered there’ll be plenty of spares innit. Not a difficult job for any decent mechanic.

2474 2018-09-22 17:40:56 If Scotland leaves there's no United Kingdom. Territorial waters extend to 12 nMiles but Exclusive Economic Zone extends to 200 nM. This gives a coastal country full control of fishing, mining and oil. Where another country is less than 200 nM away the limit is half way between.
2475 2018-09-22 17:40:52 I think Kav gets confirmed this coming week. 
Imagine the strokes if RBG's seat becomes available the week after. 
I'm not wishing the woman dead, tho I dislike her, but the reaction is so delicious to think about.

2477 2018-09-22 17:40:32 Yet ultimately that was unwound in an series of moves to deregulate and create free market pricing in an effort to lead to new sources of supply. Ultimately, we had the basis for a free market when NYMEX launched WTI in 1983 (Heating oil was 1978).
2478 2018-09-22 17:40:16 @realDonaldTrump Market forces are the major factor in setting oil derivative prices.  OPEC effects prices to the extent that they choose how much oil products do they put into the marketplace.   OPEC wants higher prices as that greatly helps their economies

2482 2018-09-22 17:39:55 That is their reasoning! She was a Native woman. Everyone knows they don't care about indigenous people in Alaska. Only when it come to the oil reserves they live on.
2483 2018-09-22 17:39:51 I think there’s an oil that cures burning eyes
2484 2018-09-22 17:39:48 Damn right he didn’t!

2495 2018-09-22 17:37:50 She needs koboko
2496 2018-09-22 17:37:48 Cash, gold, oil should also be banned then?
2497 2018-09-22 17:37:47 うれしそう
2498 2018-09-22 17:37:42 But.... 

When the revenue was good

When the oil price was great.

NOI said we were borrowing to pay Salaries.

Why the noise now?
2499 2018-09-22 17:37:34 Hi guys, get your designer perfume oil from @dejokecarew. She is reliable, humble and delivers on time. I just got my order and I love it.
2500 2018-09-22 17:37:33 Who has invaded most countries in last 100 years? Who destroyed Iraq for oil? And Afghanistan for a pipeline? Not Iran.
2501 2018-09-22 17:37:23 After I got that oil change my truck started driving so different lol
2502 2018-09-22 17:37:17 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy

2504 2018-09-22 17:37:02 This is precisely why there has never been anything of value to peoplekind to come out of the Islamic world.They are so consumed with how they can oppress and control every aspect of a women’s life and continuing to live in the 7th century. SA would be like Ethiopia if not 4 oil.

2510 2018-09-22 17:36:05 Blue collar Hispanic men work beside blue collar white men. They have right wing radio on in the background all day. The culture of the oil field workers in my area promotes a particular point of view. Democrats are seen as soft and weak.
2511 2018-09-22 17:35:54 I'll be putting on the oil soon,  first night this autumn,  not cold enough for the stove yet.......

2517 2018-09-22 17:34:42 Search Google. India is continuing buying oil from Iran. India is also buying S400 from Russia despite US pressure. Get out of your military controlled world.

2526 2018-09-22 17:32:54 Next they should write a 10-page expose on the best places in town to get an oil change and a Hallmark card at the same time
2527 2018-09-22 17:32:44 @tacobell what’s up with your chips? What kind of oil are they fried in? We just had to throw our lunch away  sorry @JustKristie2000

2534 2018-09-22 17:32:21 No politician opposes the oil industry and gets elected in Alberta. Period. It would be like running in NL opposing fishing, BC opposing logging, ON opposing manufacturing. You can't run against the economic driver (or perceived economic driver) in a region.
2535 2018-09-22 17:32:15 the fuel price is driven by global factors, the dollar, oil price, global average gdp etc.
2536 2018-09-22 17:32:13 OH FUCK NO I JUST DID A DROPPER OF MY FACE OIL CUZ IT’S THE SAME SIZE AS MY CBD OIL NOOO NO WHY
2537 2018-09-22 17:32:13 Nope. The wahabi Saudis are much more dangerous than the Iranians. The US knows this, but she needs cheap oil and she also needs a big customer for her defence industry / military products.
Remember, 9/11 terrorists were Saudis, not Iranians.
2538 2018-09-22 17:32:12 well just have clint start talking some trash tonight on radio.oil in backstrech,swaybar on track turn 2   that will get him past a few ,,,,,lol

2541 2018-09-22 17:31:57 Are you dense enough to believe that if oil doesn't come from Alberta (it's OILSANDS you idiot) it won't come from somewhere else?
The project should not take years to APPROVE.
2542 2018-09-22 17:31:54 I don’t think it should be legal to smoke it, just like PA has banned public area smoking, I don’t need the second hand smoke of that stench. However your article does not specify if the CBD oil children are given causes the same symptoms.
2543 2018-09-22 17:31:49 yes you can they are not as soft as plain flour, but still ok. Just add a little oil to the dough
2544 2018-09-22 17:31:37 Lol honestly, I nearly respect your snake oil gambit.
2545 2018-09-22 17:31:31 There is definitely plenty of oil, but since 2014 crash in prices there has been lack of exploration for replacement barrels and lack of investment in production capacity. Added supply will come from offshore wells but those take more time and investment.
2546 2018-09-22 17:31:22 World class team and trophies bought with oil money but yet still can't half fill their stadium lol!! Pathetic!! and they think they're a big team.
2547 2018-09-22 17:31:03 They said “Trump said this..Trump said that” so I said, yeah, sure.  I used to sell olive oil with his father.
2548 2018-09-22 17:30:57 #RT @SexAdviceBot: US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH: Often use an essential oil.
2549 2018-09-22 17:30:47 Omg.I put coconut oil in my hair and went outside for 2 hours and it took the pink out my hair wow
2550 2018-09-22 17:30:27 So you support countries in Middle East.
Israel Saudi Arabia UAE jordan. We pay Israel $4B a year because israel makes decision for us. Saudi & UAE fight your dirty war in Yaman  that is why you support them and Jordan has no oil.  So who do you expect to give you free oil? Iran?
2551 2018-09-22 17:30:12 Yes , he stopped passing benefits to people of india by increasing gas and petrol rate even after global oil price less !!!!! Not even single election promises has been fullfilled?? Where is smart city ?? Where is black money??where is jobs??
2552 2018-09-22 17:29:50 I thought there was no oil in and around Israel. Still Golan heights were taken by Israel in a DEFENSIVE WAR therefore any drillings are completely LEGAL.
2553 2018-09-22 17:29:41 I don't think so. Strong military?  Fight through proxies. Jewish State, Sauds, UAE, along with the Euro Powers want to steal their resources. Sauds paying for the killers. Iran is not blowing us up.  Why are we in the Middle East? Because of the Jews? Brits want the oil.
2554 2018-09-22 17:29:35 But what would be a reasonable term limit?
Is there are risk of 'revolving doors'? For example, a Judge casts the deciding vote in a ruling that favours the oil industry; then after retirement from Supreme Court they start working on the board of an oil company.

2560 2018-09-22 17:28:30 Well, give her a year. Let her find all the greatest Feminazi liars in the country. Empanel them and drag Kavanaugh before the Inquisition and try him for being white and male. And why not castrate him, because he is guilty as charged.
2561 2018-09-22 17:28:16 Maddow is not yur friend Justine. She’s selling snake oil.
2562 2018-09-22 17:28:15 Imagine those oil rigs you promised @realDonaldTrump as far as the eye can see. At least you got the GOP tax thing through. And probably rammed Kavanaugh into a Supreme Court seat too. Nice. Suck it Alaska you voted for Mer - COW- ski

2573 2018-09-22 17:26:22 Tankers carrying tar sand oil are a serious threat to the habitat of endangered orcas. Yet Alberta is planning the world's largest open-pit tar sand mine. If realized, it would wipe out 292 square kilometers of forests and wetlands and be a disaster for the climate.
2574 2018-09-22 17:26:18 my car always needs an oil change, my tires always need air, and im always getting gas.... can we just have a car that doesnt need any of that shit and runs perfectly? yes? thanks.

2576 2018-09-22 17:26:13 Did you stop cold turkey? I would like more information on how you did it. I got CBD oil and i don't the right amounts to take.
2577 2018-09-22 17:26:06 Better. I'm going to get her some CBD oil this morning.

2581 2018-09-22 17:25:09 Big pharmaceutical would lose billions. CBD oil cured my son of his autistic episodes, he has all of the genius none of the uncontrollable tantrums.

2588 2018-09-22 17:24:40 "Gotta..find the rest of my fucking arm." Finally, she looks over to it with Santiago helping her stand; it's still sparking wildly with a steady drip of oil and blood and she groans. Great. 

"Don't know if I can fix that." She leans her head against him. She feels heavy.

2591 2018-09-22 17:24:12 I thought we were talking about gold..I do not know where this oil comes into the story. If one assumes a 1.8m bpd US shale growth in 2019 and another 2m bpd in 2020 there is still a global deficit.
2592 2018-09-22 17:24:04 It’s the truffle oil that makes all the difference lol!
2593 2018-09-22 17:23:41 Please get your fries away from my truffle oil
2594 2018-09-22 17:23:39 tbh I’ve always used coconut oil while it’s still open/raw & then once it starts getting scabby/itchy I use an oatmeal lotion. As for soap I always go with unscented antibacterial  those combos have worked for my tattoos!’m
2595 2018-09-22 17:23:24 Does a shot of snake blood and vodka count as eating? 
Raw sea urchin was like a mouthful of flem.
Don't recommend either.
Jalapeño pickled in fish oil was surprisingly boring.
Raw Fugu (Japanese puffer fish) was pretty flavourless.
Not sure what counts as weird.
2596 2018-09-22 17:23:22 Good for you. Check with your doctor and try adding lavender oil to a diffuser or a lotion...it helps
2597 2018-09-22 17:23:16 Sorry, lame question. But how to pakai oil cleanser eh? Sapu terus kat muka right? Xpayah basahkan muka? N when is the right time to use oil cleanser? After or b4 cuci muka?

2639 2018-09-22 17:19:52 Sitting in the waiting room while getting my oil changed and I'm almost certain someone's phone accidentally just starting playing porn.
2640 2018-09-22 17:19:51 At the oil change place. There's a beat up Jeep next to me gunning his engine for no reason & the car in front of me has an 8U4LNCH license plate. It's like car detention.
2641 2018-09-22 17:19:43 How about investing at home. We need Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas and a geoengineering like the Manhattan Project to save Humanity.
2642 2018-09-22 17:19:39 I had no idea "insane conspiracy theory snake oil salesman" job was still available

2652 2018-09-22 17:18:23 /3/ A massive new oil pipeline extracting from tar sands accelerates greenhouse gas production and is completely incompatible with the most basic environmental stewardship that we owe ourselves and future generations.  The project should not take years to reject.

2655 2018-09-22 17:18:08 Look at the Scousers as well, it’s not just the manager it’s the board and owners it all needs to be right! City’s success is oil bought but you can’t fault the set up, got proper football men running the club with a clear vision.
2656 2018-09-22 17:18:07 Ya and everyday we use oil products. The world can't run on cliches and Amazon.
2657 2018-09-22 17:17:51 can you tell about when will crude oil get reduced

2664 2018-09-22 17:16:48 The so called growth in revenue outside oil, how has it translated to better economy.
It's only this government that cannot account for what the revenues have been used for since inception.
2665 2018-09-22 17:16:27 I think that bold colors would be nice, but nothing too dark. If you were to do pastels though, make sure they’re oil pastels and not the chalky type to make the color stand out more.

2669 2018-09-22 17:15:30 It's our past, our ancestors, our heritage & nothing to be proud of or celebrated. 
Same thing goes for monuments depicting Confederate, nothing to be proud of. 
You absolutely can't be a true Christian & racist. They mix like oil & water. Which is another subject all together.

2673 2018-09-22 17:15:08 And the wars can stop as soon as we have someone in office who isn't being paid by defense contractors and oil companies to keep them going. The wars can end; the American people just need to vote for someone who will stop sending our young people into a sausage grinder.

2675 2018-09-22 17:15:01 Francisco, what is your estimate of the total $$$ of oil revenue lost since August of 2017 due to the production collapse that took place since then?
2676 2018-09-22 17:14:42 The 'leaders' we are talking of now have tested oil money. They don't want to lose that privilege. Also, restructuring will surely retire some of them as most derive the power they throw around at the state & regional level from the centre.
2677 2018-09-22 17:14:39 Heh. I grew up in Chicago, and did quite a bit of that too. I remember the Blizzard of '79, when the narrow side streets on the North Side were literally impassible and we almost ran out of furnace oil because the truck couldn't deliver. Uggh.

2683 2018-09-22 17:14:14 Eat healthy oils - butter, bacon, beef fat, any animal fat, olive oil, coconut oil. They heal our brain. Read on keto diet, see what you can readily apply.
2684 2018-09-22 17:14:12 What's coconut oil supposed to do? I never heard that one.
2685 2018-09-22 17:13:58 NDP inherited #ableg mess on all #abpoli files after 44+yrs of PCs, oil price tanked, FM fire,etc. Fix shambles in 3+yrs? Bollocks! +PCs 2.0 can do better? PCs 2.0 under ex-PC Health Min Mandel? Yes,NDP can & should do better on #PWD. So much to manage post-PCs & this is a biggie
2686 2018-09-22 17:13:54 Typical Progressive...beholden to his benefactors as greatly as any Texas big oil republican.

Someday ppl will wake up to the fact ALL politicians are self serving charlatans.

2692 2018-09-22 17:13:17 Everytime I come to get my oil changed they try to sell me enough parts to build a whole new car.
2693 2018-09-22 17:13:12 you might be in the south if the old man ringing up your oil change apologizes for his french when he says “this thang is pissin’ me off”
2694 2018-09-22 17:13:10 I’ll get the oil
2695 2018-09-22 17:13:09 o’rourke is a snake oil salesmen

2698 2018-09-22 17:12:48 My Cards are leaking oil 
2699 2018-09-22 17:12:34 We should think about possibly recolonising the the entire middle eastern region and simply take the oil. The Middle East has no real culture that is worth protecting. They produce nothing, create nothing invent nothing. Let’s westernise the region and end their useless cultures?
2700 2018-09-22 17:12:33 I need an oil change 
2701 2018-09-22 17:12:30 Once they break them up, like Standard Oil. Don't let them own the new platforms.

2706 2018-09-22 17:11:59 I actually hope #CBC and your company sees these comments. Who do you work for again?  Oil and gas company? Taking money from government of what projects?  What was your bonus again last year?
2707 2018-09-22 17:11:58 I don’t know what girl needs to hear this... but get an oil change.
2708 2018-09-22 17:11:57 In this moment it's like all out clash for markets in the oil markets and Trump tweets dictating main guidelines ..

2710 2018-09-22 17:11:48 Babe I brought an electric smelly thing you fill it up with water&smelly oil it puffs it out babe I love it
2711 2018-09-22 17:11:47 a year ago today i blew up my car because it didn’t have oil so in honor of that i got my oil changed today 
2712 2018-09-22 17:11:33 The barber sprays the oil sheen on you after a nice haircut only for you to turn around and realize he’s just vaping at your head
2713 2018-09-22 17:11:32 Yes, they'll reduce the oil prices.
But also they'll increase the taxes. 

Fir aap bologe Tax kam karo, paisa nahi hai haath me. 

Its matter of supply and demand, and it will settle eventually
2714 2018-09-22 17:11:15 N Sea Oil is not declining. I've heard them say that every 5 years for 40 years. 
It is being extracted against an assessment amount suitable for business decisions.

Even so, doesn't matter if it is.
2715 2018-09-22 17:11:14 There is no such thing as Golan Heights oil. Golan Heights were used by Hezballah to attack Israel and therefore Israel is right to take it.
2716 2018-09-22 17:11:00 Idaho is like a survivalist mountain man who accidentally got rich supplying tree oil to Whole Foods.
2717 2018-09-22 17:10:59 The earlier you know that they're not sincere,the better, most are just money making and syphoning avenue

2720 2018-09-22 17:10:53 If u didn’t drink the old oil u gotta pay  extra, sorry
2721 2018-09-22 17:10:46 It depends. If your hair is too dry or oily then you shouldn't use natural oils. Linseed oil is good in that case. But if your hair is normal then coconut oil is the best.
2722 2018-09-22 17:10:36 He is awesome  yes the electric stove are so different and also if anything drops it makes sometimes fire . It has happened to me before , like old grease or oil . Cook  using medium best. Congratulations!!
2723 2018-09-22 17:10:34 That would be awesome. We do not have a vet leader on defense. Two years ago we had Fraser. He made a difference. We need a leader on the ice in D to keep young kids heads calm.
2724 2018-09-22 17:10:25 So yesterday we saved a froggy. The ppl who owned the house before had these traps that had sticky gel stuff and a frog/toad got stuck. Completely stuck. It was sad but with enough Olive oil & patience, we freed the little guy. Hope he’s okay  #puff

2728 2018-09-22 17:09:37 Muslim integration difficult, but mixing issues. African migration is economic opportunism. Muslim one because of support of Salafi IS type Jihadis against secular Syria by west,oil, Israeli lobby to weaken Iran, creating mess. Also ovethrow of Gadaffi- Libya now Trafficking hub.

2738 2018-09-22 17:08:36 the world has more than enough oil,speculators drive the price, and that is ignored by the media and the governments, time to make oil traders take physical delivery, stop the speculation, get prices where they belong
2739 2018-09-22 17:08:31 In Afghanistan, in the Middle East, our American soldiers do not fight for freedom and democracy.
They are protecting American companies working for drug and oil smuggling.
2740 2018-09-22 17:08:29 It’s hilariously wrong.
2741 2018-09-22 17:08:02 My original comment suggests that reclamation of oil sands leases will only be taken seriously when all the bitumen has been extracted. Of course, there are on-going reclamation studies right now, but they cannot yet tell what needs to be done and how much it will cost. /4

If it's so vivid and it's eating her up inside, she should just get it over with.

2769 2018-09-22 17:05:18 Despite what commentators think, rain doesn't make a football pitch "greasy." Unless the clouds are producing olive oil or animal fats, the word you are looking for is "wet".

2781 2018-09-22 17:04:26 Saying my goodbyes, I had older folks who had long careers in oil and gas telling me, “I wish I would have done what you’re doing years ago!” I was pumped, and I was now going to be a professional poker player. Yes!! This was a dream come true. #garyvee
2782 2018-09-22 17:04:25 Lastly, there is the question of scale. The footprint of oil sands operations is enormous. We know the difficulty of recreating self-sustaining ecosystems on smaller scales, but oil sands reclamation is on a whole different level altogether. We are venturing into the  unknown /3

2784 2018-09-22 17:04:23 In Afghanistan, in the Middle East, our American soldiers do not fight for freedom and democracy.
They are protecting American companies working for drug and oil smuggling.

2786 2018-09-22 17:04:16 I hope they will be so defeated & demoralized by the mid term election (as well as the REAL conspiracy/collusion news that’s about to hit the fan) that they barely put up a fight.

2792 2018-09-22 17:03:51 America is reliant on Canadian Softwood, Canadian Uranium, Canadian oil and in some Northern States Hydro Electric Power etc. etc. American cannot produce enough of any of these examples. America has spent 3.5 trillion since trump took office and have yet to balance the books.
2793 2018-09-22 17:03:30 The government has leased some of our public land to oil and although the Wild horses are protected they are being thrown out because the the secretary of Interior wants more room for the cattle ranchers cattle. greed.Subjectiing our wildlife to slaughter
2794 2018-09-22 17:03:27 Doesnt coconut oil help promote fat burning?also lemon water and apple cider vinegar??
2795 2018-09-22 17:03:27 73 w 454....nice...they dropped horsepower in early 70's due to crude oil prices    u had a great one
2796 2018-09-22 17:03:15 Jobs.  Oil.  That's what I'm picking up on in KS, OK & TX Heavy environmental restrictions cut jobs. With those relaxed they can go to town.  The oil industry knows Trump is trash, but, dear god, the money is good!
2797 2018-09-22 17:02:14 I’m thinking about coming out with a YouTube show explaining the last 50 years of financial maneuvering by the US government through the oil embargo the savings and loan housing prices the introduction of the Internet the coming college/auto/mortgage debt disaster.

2801 2018-09-22 17:02:01 Shameless rulers,  child grant in South Africa is over 10,000 monthly,  elderly / disability  grant is over 40,000 per month for life.
Building over a million houses each since 1994 free for the poor,
Over 17 million people on social grants paid monthly and they don't have oil..
2802 2018-09-22 17:01:45 @realDonaldTrump See really dirtier than this diet in the world, our people must cry. The horrible incident shows that the work of the US government is right and that Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November 4, the oil exports to Iran should reach zero, zero, zero, zero.
2803 2018-09-22 17:01:30 wow i don’t wanna go get my oil changed 
2804 2018-09-22 17:01:17 I’ve routinely gone to loading terminals either shell or imperial oil and sometimes chevron (parkland now) and been told they have run out of diesel or regular.

2815 2018-09-22 17:00:13 Not really. Where does the subsidy came from? By signing bonds with all oil comps & countries, making them to be returned in few years. That's what they gave it back now. They can make some deals to provide subsidy by signing debt bonds. U don't know my bg, neither I, don't judge
2816 2018-09-22 17:00:09 I love oil changes where you don’t have to get out the car lol

2823 2018-09-22 16:59:45 I was wondering how Taxi drivers have gone into hiding after the UP election. Glad they are back now. Tried asking them about ISRO's Chandrayaan mission? Global warming? Coconut oil poison? This new Netflix series?
2824 2018-09-22 16:59:40 Though there are many theoretical thoughts on this but all North Sea Oil would be a great contributor to the power of Scotland’s ability to function independently as well as their wish to be part of the EU. One certain is that a proportion of the revenues would be due to Scotland
2825 2018-09-22 16:59:24 Scotland has a choice. 
It doesn't matter as we have massive resources. 

Scot Pound is good for investment (Another Hard currency)
Dollar is good as its oil currency
GBP is good because we own part already
Euro is good as its EU.
2826 2018-09-22 16:59:08 Venezuela issued a sovereign currency backed by the largest oil reserves in the world.  It implemented socialism and printed money to appease the masses.  This led to massive inflation and the breakdown of society.  It happens often in socialist and totalitarian regimes.
2827 2018-09-22 16:59:01 Well it's seems most don't understand is with the US sanctions going into effect, OPEC already had a plan for the shortfall of oil production and the US was already producing oil, and the phone call was two guys talking. But hey, whatever
2828 2018-09-22 16:58:59 Ps. You know that they feel weak and beaten, and realise that hard Brexit is probably dead, when they start to blame EU and Remainers for not allowing them to have unicorns instead of accepting that their snake oil sales pitch has been exposed for what it is.
2829 2018-09-22 16:58:46 We should tell the US Government that Neptune has oil in order to get recon in beautiful HD images. 
2830 2018-09-22 16:58:45 Shaved his beards and forgot to apply oil,his jaw was jus white like elubo,I am sorry Austin I could not tell you all those years u kept asking why

2836 2018-09-22 16:58:10 They got oil, lol.
2837 2018-09-22 16:57:55 @NicolaSturgeon you have more pressing business than trolling the PM. Stick to day job and clean up mess that is your education system; apologise for the horrendously misleading oil price stats in your 'budget'; see @AlecSalmond sorted and forget #indyref2

2839 2018-09-22 16:57:38 "In my opinion, there's no shortage and we don't need to panic - with or without #Iran in the market. If you go to the fundamentals we have enough oil to meet market need... if we include countries not represented in the meeting," says Oman's Oil Minister. #Opec #JMMC #OOTT
2840 2018-09-22 16:57:28 we should plant productive trees instead of non beneficial trees.e.g.plam trees on our coastal areas n olive trees in pothohar area for edible oil.Regional fruit trees on motor way n highways.

2842 2018-09-22 16:57:24 In oil sand operations, reclamation plans are required, but they're not scrutinized nearly as critically as those in mining projects. For instance, there are some thoughts on how to reclaim tailings, but these ideas have never been demonstrated on a large scale. /2
2843 2018-09-22 16:57:21 No I mean that the Chinese are going to want something for that money when Venezuela defaults.  That will be a military base.  The oil is secondary.  It is a means for the Chinese to claim a need to protect its resources.  It will be met with the same resistance as Cuba circa JFK

2848 2018-09-22 16:57:16 I agree with mandatory CPD. My dad can fire up the boiler on a train and is phenominal with oil burners still. He worked on the largest gas burners in the country but he would not be able to do what the engineers now do on modern boilers. Our knowledge does need updating
2849 2018-09-22 16:57:12 I smell like coconut oil and Givenchy. You can’t tell me shit.
2850 2018-09-22 16:57:06 Transforming the most beautiful City in Canada into an oil shipping port from what it is today...all to fetch a better price isn’t a good enough reason. Once the line is twinned, this $15B / year climbs with the greed of extra tax revenues over environmental costs and risks.
2851 2018-09-22 16:56:57 Then why is the price of a barrel of oil rising. Would  it having anything to do with Iran not able to export oil,and American energy companies raking the dollars in.
2852 2018-09-22 16:56:20 And what the hell has tax got to do with decontrolling pricing? Still the govt is completely capable of controlling the prices by taxes as the oil company rate is Rs.40(Central &state taxes) lesser than current fuel price! You dont have an argument or an iota of logic! Enough 
2853 2018-09-22 16:56:19 America would LOVE it if Bendy and the ink machine was replaced with OIL
2854 2018-09-22 16:56:15 I forgot that this oil change place actually wipes down the windshields and he was putting his AWL in cleaning both of mine

2856 2018-09-22 16:55:53 What you fail to see is the growth in revues outside oil. At least, we have moved from Oil revenue dependent economy to a diversified one!

With fiscal prudence, NIgerian Custom service and FIRS are remitting more than ever.

2863 2018-09-22 16:55:03 You're right, maybe Alberta should stop shipping oil and gas for BC and just focus on export markets. 

But that wouldn't be very neighborly now would it?

2867 2018-09-22 16:54:36 This Govt could have performed way better than they did if the country makes the kind of money that the previous govt made from oil. Its about 1/3rd, yet they are able to invest massively in infrastructure, did not lay off workers, embarked on many social intervention prog .

2871 2018-09-22 16:53:53 Yes. Their demand is growing at a rate projected to double oil demand by 2035. Even with the most aggressive Renewable Energy programs alongside that demand.

2874 2018-09-22 16:53:44 We import US oil in the East and export in the West, price differential is less than $15. Light sweet crude oil requires less energy to refine and sells for a better price. WCS discount is the need for transportation given the refinery locations, most of which are in the Gulf.

2906 2018-09-22 16:49:57 I normally hate going to the oil shop cus all the weird guys try to hit on you, but today the lady gave me a student discount so today I’m a fan of them 
2907 2018-09-22 16:49:48 Really? i only i had known. Bought the rosehip oil because everyone keeps raving about it
2908 2018-09-22 16:49:39 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2909 2018-09-22 16:49:26 After just one application of my new skin oil my face feels amazing !!!! visit my shop to place an order, find us on facebook lionheartsflow@gardenofedensoils  did you know I use 100% pure organic oils in all my blends.

2911 2018-09-22 16:49:12 Arvin-you're a joke. Trump should learn from you.
This is not an article - it's the company message to market, saying "Suspends Oil Program. Company Plans to Accelerate Retail Energy Business". They are actually saying: (after 6 attempts), we have stopped trying ..see next
2912 2018-09-22 16:49:10 Kanye I’m an oil painter and designer from Wisconsin. Let’s talk. Hit me up
2913 2018-09-22 16:49:10 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2914 2018-09-22 16:48:57 Also I made a your mom joke at him and he walked up to me and said “my mother died recently” so I just stuck my entire head in the fryer oil
2915 2018-09-22 16:48:43 My psych, who is coming up to retirement, also advised me to take cog liver oil x 3 per day. I joked that he has got shares in cod liver oil industry...but the evidence is there that EPA does help in bipolar.
2916 2018-09-22 16:48:43 He must av bin getting free salt packages to take home.
2917 2018-09-22 16:48:27 It was when I saw a $38 dollar pizza with truffle oil and some fancy term for cheddar cheese that i realized that hipsters ruin everything.

2919 2018-09-22 16:48:16 Dealt a crap hand!?  She dealt this hand to  herself. She put all her eggs in one basket and thought her very own green movement would roll over. 

There were markers all along this road she chose to ignore and now she can’t even run Alberta on $70 oil.
2920 2018-09-22 16:48:11 Ways to deal with Squeaky Wheel Syndrome in Local Government:
1. Oil the wheel (but that strategy rarely works).
2. Let the wheel carry the entire load and fail.
3. Make another wheel even louder in its squeaks.
4. Remove the wheel & take to disposal facility (tyranny option).
2921 2018-09-22 16:48:09 Demonetization has done to hide black money?
People was busy 2 change currency. Govt takes opportunity to hide black money at that moment?
Govt. asking its returns 2X then they are bother to pay 80000 core loan & thats why they can't able to reduce tax in petroleum oil !
2922 2018-09-22 16:48:06 Economic benefits of high oil prices for India 

1. Reduce per capita consumption of oil thereby reducing import volume (not value)  by encouraging shift to alternates and more efficient use

2. Higher taxes improve fisc enabling govt to provide support in times of need

2924 2018-09-22 16:47:23 Our focus should be on reducing carbon emissions.

98% of cars in the world burn fossil fuels. We are happy to make sure we support auto workers but not oil workers.
The net result of restricting #Alberta oil to market is lower prices in the  for  oil.

2926 2018-09-22 16:46:58 I am not justifying that Govt can't reduce tax here, let that be clear. This tax loot been happening for last 10 years when UPA decided to give control for oil companies to decide price. NDA is a culprit in continuing. In world who doesn't have oil resource by own increases price
2927 2018-09-22 16:46:58 Money Monday’s bello lets rip it up!! Oil convention Lyon, France tonight at Paul Bocuse
2928 2018-09-22 16:46:37 So, in other words, the #FalseFlag Middle East #RegimeChange Wars initiated by the US & its allies, are having their desired effect of reducing supply in order to make their higher cost oil needed.

You don't have to tell the 99%, we already know who the #DeepState is.

2931 2018-09-22 16:46:17 The world uses oil and Canada is foolish to not get top dollar for our resources. Pipelines to the coast are the only way to change this.
2932 2018-09-22 16:46:16 And we have a great thing is allah the real god with us and we have everything we need, oil, diamonds, gold عاش سلمان يا بلادي عاش سلمان 
2933 2018-09-22 16:46:08 Aren’t oil extraction jobs more dangerous too?
2934 2018-09-22 16:46:04 Rick Simpson oil is amazing. The THC component is what really drives the cancer out.

2939 2018-09-22 16:44:58 In fact, the official series reported by authorities to OPEC times the start of the decline in production at late 2014. A plausible story is that the 2-year plunge in oil prices led to massive disinvestment, and we begin to see the effects of this in 2016.
2940 2018-09-22 16:44:49 Try almond oil!! That was a life saver!!
2941 2018-09-22 16:44:36 Iran + Venezuela oil blocked out from international markets, can result in oil  prices steady increasing in coming months. #Pakistan need to plan this now @Asad_Umar Business as usual old style won't cut it.
2942 2018-09-22 16:44:36 Haha, This whole concept that she is actually angry about a supposed bad hand she’s dealt is laughable. She hates oil, Is probably still friends with Berman and couldn’t give a crap about how much debt she racks up for this province or ever getting it back on track

2947 2018-09-22 16:44:12 They fired the executives running those companies because they were protesting by ceasing the production of oil which is kind of a big deal when that's 85% of your country's economy. 

Correct me when I'm wrong
2948 2018-09-22 16:44:09 Cooked up two beats while waiting for my oil change. What a good start to the day
2949 2018-09-22 16:44:02 Use a sugar scrub on your lips and every night put some coconut oil on them which using a good chapstick during the day! Carmex, Burt’s bees, and eos are good

2956 2018-09-22 16:42:55 Chicken be swimming in oil and that’s your better choice?
2957 2018-09-22 16:42:35 Fair enough. Enjoy your oil. We'll just die. No worries. Have a nice day white folk$!
2958 2018-09-22 16:42:26 wao too much oil
2959 2018-09-22 16:42:24 Apple Pay just saved me. Went to get a oil change and found out I didn’t have my wallet so I asked them if they had Apple Pay and they said they did.  So I use that shout out to Apple for the win! @Apple
2960 2018-09-22 16:42:22 There is no better feeling then getting out the shower putting coconut oil on your skin & laying there naked.... MOOD ASF 
2961 2018-09-22 16:42:11 How many people benefit directly or indirectly from the oil and gas industry in Texas?
2962 2018-09-22 16:42:09 Someone slept with that?

I mean, I'm no oil painting, but FFS.

2964 2018-09-22 16:41:57 I give full body massages too. With coconut oil and any oil you want. I guess we could give each other massage then.
2965 2018-09-22 16:41:56 Just took me 2 hours to get an oil change
2966 2018-09-22 16:41:51 As one black student put it: "I didn't think and yet at the Chevron Oil Engineering black student MBA pre medical engineering steering committee reports reiterated that the black "new" guy recruit orientation week at Bendix had been postponed too many and yet the "blue book"

2978 2018-09-22 16:40:51 Delicious! I popped my own in olive oil then sprinkled some parsley, garlic powder, salt, and Italian herbs... dipped in balsamic vinegar. Sooo good!
2979 2018-09-22 16:40:47 Because I know my government well. We rape and pillage countries. We plunder the resources and destroy people to protect our hegemony in the name of American imperialism. Tread carefully. Not only do you ally with our opposition you have lots of oil. Doubly attractive.
2980 2018-09-22 16:40:46 Everytime I come to get an oil change, they TRY to tell me I need a million other things done. FOH

2991 2018-09-22 16:40:03 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
2992 2018-09-22 16:39:56 Man, we had a hot rod last night!! We were running top 10/15 lap times until we had a cracked oil fitting end our night. So thankful to drive the @Gruntstyle Chevy. Thank you @RichmondRaceway, still my favorite track!!!

3000 2018-09-22 16:38:50 Let them Bellow black oil filled fumes. Crying for cars in a pothole infested dilapidated road network country. They should sit down and justify their worth.
3001 2018-09-22 16:38:34 But it prioritized the oil production because the extreme poverty was the biggest priority, when the price of oil crashed everything went to shit. No doubt there's mismanagement afoot, but it's be disingenuous to fail to mention the foreign intervention at hand
3002 2018-09-22 16:38:32 Interesting to see a first generation Iranian defending British Imperialism. Would you have said the same thing over the pieces of 'land' they used to control which happened to be Iranian oil fields or if they had controlled our Gulf Islands from hundreds of miles away?
3003 2018-09-22 16:38:27 Gaskiya its high time those Berom murderers are dealt with, since they have refused to live and let live , wait why are they protesting draining that pond self @ishakaa

3013 2018-09-22 16:37:16 You are very delusional. People are not going to go without energy if the pipeline is not built. It's raw unprocessed oil that will be pumped through the pipeline, not gasoline or a product that will be burned to power anything.

3018 2018-09-22 16:36:26 It’s a message to check your oil pressure gauge, gas gauge, voltage gauge anything that measures on your instrument cluster. Those gauges read in resistance or ohms as well as microvolts when something is a low reading coming through the gauge, it sends out a message.
3019 2018-09-22 16:36:15 Next up, the ISIS Ice cream social!
3020 2018-09-22 16:35:52 By the time it gets built with all the delays the world won't need oil!
3021 2018-09-22 16:35:35 Also, what is defined as a "resource" in capitalism is subject to an extremely narrow definition which -- no surprise -- bolsters the system of private profit for a few, often at great human cost. Oil is a "resource," but a livable planet is not, etc.
3022 2018-09-22 16:35:14 Oh wow  I love when beauties are covered in oil 
3023 2018-09-22 16:34:47 Isn't it funny how Norway has over $200 BILLION set aside from part of there carefully managed OIL REVENUE,plus look what huge projects Dubai keeps doing from oil,now check where OUR OIL money is,when WM got hold of it ! Mass POVERTY & £1.7 TRILLION DEBT ?
3024 2018-09-22 16:34:40 The reality is that we buy less than 3% (three) of our oil from them.  We produce most of our own oil and buy the rest from South America.  The OPEC rising prices do not affect us.  Scare mongering, DJT.

3030 2018-09-22 16:33:47 I don't even know how many hours are on this tractor. Eight or nine k... 4 years ago it got a new lease on life. Total rebuild after a farm hand forgot to tighten the drain plug after an oil change. It thinks it's an 8000 series now LOL Got to be over 200hp
3031 2018-09-22 16:33:41 More oil by train. So much better? 

Widen the debate to build a national #EnergyCorridor, east to west, to transport, oil, gas AND electricity coast to coast rather than dumping electricity & oil on the cheap in US, the main beneficiary. 

Where is this debate, Andrew? Lead it!

3040 2018-09-22 16:32:38 Back in the 1970s, the SNP was bold and adventurous enough to accommodate a performance of John McGrath's 'The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil' during its conference.  Today's SNP?  Apparently not so much. #Balernoism 
3041 2018-09-22 16:32:36 No, the dissipation is worse than a watercooled setup on a normal rig. The surface area being cooled on the mineral oil setup is comparatively small because of the boiling but a conventional setup with a copper plate maintains contact at all times.
3042 2018-09-22 16:32:36 Nigerians are so smart that’s despite having one of the world’s largest oil reserves have failed to turn their country into a first world nation. While immigrating to a country and  taking advantage of “lazy” black American efforts.
3043 2018-09-22 16:32:28 Yeah I'm missing mine too. If you find it send it to me in TX. My oil pumps have all dried up. Must be why my privilege went away.

3047 2018-09-22 16:32:08 Many liberals will claim..... but, but, but the Great Recession. But remember what Reagan inherited. Massive inflation of 13.5%, 20% interest rates which lead to more than 10% unemployment and an oil embargo. And under Reagan, the Fed didn't engage in massive stimulus, in fact
3048 2018-09-22 16:31:59 CBD oil is legal here in Tennessee but ya gotta be rich to afford it.
3049 2018-09-22 16:31:37 Keep developers, ranchers, miners, lumberjacks, oil drillers, frackers off our public lands. 

#NationalPublicLandsDay
3050 2018-09-22 16:31:26 I’m waiting for my car to get an oil change and there’s a family next to me and football on the TVs. The little girl asked her dad why he was watching football. He said he likes football. She goes “you’re a big dummy”. I felt that
3051 2018-09-22 16:31:20 Had the deviled eggs at @churchkeydc last night and I died and went to chili oil heaven.
3052 2018-09-22 16:31:19 Stop nagging already!  Everyone needs energy and reliable infrastructure.  Shall we stop extracting oil or treating polluted water sources just so you can save on taxes? Don't be ridiculous.
3053 2018-09-22 16:31:16 She uses Moroccan argon oil which helps unclog pores! I’ve also got it and it works a dream 
3054 2018-09-22 16:31:07 @FoxNews Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois are on the hook for millions of dollars to clean up contaminated Kiel Bros. Oil Co. sites, the failed Pence family gas stations. Pence family gas stations left costly environmental legacy ...

3058 2018-09-22 16:30:37 @HamidMirPAK this is called unbiased journalism. Indian jurnalist speaks and write  for the betterment of Indo-Pak relation, whereas jurnalist like you put oil on the fire with your bitter words.
3059 2018-09-22 16:29:57 People forget oil protects the skin...
3060 2018-09-22 16:29:51 Gravel? I really believe you need at least 2 to 3 players on your roster who push your veterans. My biggest concern. Koskinen. 2.5 may have been pissed down the toilet.

3064 2018-09-22 16:29:34 Omg just use coconut oil! One application and it’s gone 
3065 2018-09-22 16:29:14 2 dabs in a rigg> 2 hits de oil pen
3066 2018-09-22 16:29:06 I work as an environmental consultant, largely for the mining industry and for us, plans for reclamation begin at Day -18250. In Alberta, reclamation of oil sands leases appears to be taken seriously 182500 days after operations begin.
3067 2018-09-22 16:29:02 You and your whole family is shameless. For power you fall so low, make agreement with China, ISI, Pakistan, Maoists, manipulate financial institutions, make deals with Saudi and oil companies. One thing is people are aware they r not illiterate as the case in 70 years of ur rule
3068 2018-09-22 16:28:54 And sprinkle a little truffle oil on top.
3069 2018-09-22 16:28:53 He didn’t build that!
3070 2018-09-22 16:28:48 Get some tea tree oil and mix 1/4 tsp of that with 9, 1/4 tsp of water. Apply it as often as it dries out or before you go to bed. It brings all the bacteria to the surface, reduces redness and swelling all while keeping your skin hydrated. 
3071 2018-09-22 16:28:46 ไม่ต้องค่ะจิ้มได้เลย ครั้งละสิบโหวต ถ้าติดลิมิดต้องเปลี่ยนเป็นโหมดการบิน เปิดแล้วก็ปิดให้กลับเป็นโหมดมือถือ จิ้มได้เรื่อยๆค่ะ
3072 2018-09-22 16:28:43 Behind!? Tax break brings more money to my house... and I ain't rich...so u dont know where you're coming from! And all my oil industry employees are back to work... so speak for yourself.

3076 2018-09-22 16:28:09 The age of oil is ending, but it will not end in your life or mine. Wind and solar are great, I love them, but they don't move goods, don't produce crops, and frankly it will be decades yet before they can. Oil and gas are not the best resource, but it is what we have.
3077 2018-09-22 16:28:06 Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois are on the hook for millions of dollars to clean up contaminated Kiel Bros. Oil Co. sites, the failed Pence family gas stations.
3078 2018-09-22 16:27:57 Agreed. Has to play like he did 2 years ago pre injury period.
3079 2018-09-22 16:27:44 So that doesn't change the fact that you're oil money

3083 2018-09-22 16:27:09 Am I the only cunt who eats coconut oil
3084 2018-09-22 16:27:08 I started taking a prenatal vitamin bc I’m lazy and it seemed easier than taking C,D, E, and fish oil all separately. (No little Homers in the picture-it’s really just a convenience thing) 

Not only is it easier, but my nails are so strong and have grown so fast. I am loving it!
3085 2018-09-22 16:27:08 1 egg, 3/4 cup olive oil, splash of cider vinegar .. immersion blend. 

Best homemade mayo. Super healthy, no terrible soy or vegetable oils or preservatives.
3086 2018-09-22 16:26:51 No sorry. Americans don't support regime change in Iran and we are fighting our govt officials to stop supplying Iranians with money to overthrow their govt. 

We are done with regime change wars. Iran gets to keep Pars. Fuck off oil and gas companies.

3088 2018-09-22 16:26:48 Crazy how UK is committing cultural suicide. Globalist elite have clearly hijacked any semblance of democracy to further arms sales, fight wars for oil, etc.

I have friends in UK who have gotten death threats from such jihadist types.
3089 2018-09-22 16:26:46 1st check mekap dulu, make sure make jenis yg bukan oily base, then check product skin care apa you guna.. Jgn guna harsh ingredients inside the skincare product.. And claymask can reduce ur oil..

3091 2018-09-22 16:26:18 My greatest shame is that one time I got so drunk I accidentally took a shot of olive oil
3092 2018-09-22 16:26:12 Yolk and heavy whipping cream whisked together with coffee brewed over it (typically the cafe forte settinting on my ninja coffee bar). Add grassfed butter and/or coconut oil. It tastes like creamy toffee. I usually add cinnamon.
3093 2018-09-22 16:26:11 As an Iranian girl to Donald Trump 
Today you've just requested to putting a beautiful Nuclear BOMB on Israel. And Destroy all your Arabs oil factories.  
Jf that's what you want we can make that True 
Don't Awak this Ticking Bomb in Iran.

3097 2018-09-22 16:25:52 So anyway, this morning I cleverly put olive oil ear drops in my eye instead of the eye drops. They @$^&%$(% sting. 
I don't recommend it. It seems like it'll be OK. 
No idea how one is supposed to safely flush an eye with cold water for 20 minutes at home (111 advice).

3099 2018-09-22 16:25:44 I don’t remember the liquid centre! They were a Christmas staple at my grandparents house & I quite liked them. Also the orange & lemon slices 
3100 2018-09-22 16:25:30 @BBCR1 @mistajam cold solutions I use are hot toddy if I feel 1 coming on (dash of whiskey or bourbon in warmed milk (like expresso size). For cold/cough aromatherapy; peppermint, eucalyptus etc mixed in unperfumed body rub or oil & rub into chest. Oh & Vix Vapor rub
3101 2018-09-22 16:25:23 this is why if the west hadn't discovered, developed and distributed oil for them, they would still be cooking with camel manure, living in tents, and eating grub worms
3102 2018-09-22 16:25:22 What’s ethical about Alberta oil as compared to say Venezuelan or ME oil?
3103 2018-09-22 16:25:16 Try some CBD oil.
3104 2018-09-22 16:25:03 Does anyone have oily skin hacks/products that ACTUALLY work ??? I’m drowning in oil pls help
3105 2018-09-22 16:25:00 Just spent $110 on a full service oil change,  new filters, car wash and vacuum. My car is about to drive so much better.
3106 2018-09-22 16:25:00 If this team needs those two to play key roles this season, it's going to be a long season. Oilers don't have the necessary depth to shelter them and it will cost them.

3111 2018-09-22 16:24:06 Are there no agorist ways of developing oil? Albertans should start looking into it. No matter how filthy or awful what you'd have to do would be, it wouldn't be as bad as sharing the revenue with the troglodyte European style global Communists in the Quebec.
3112 2018-09-22 16:24:00 The second-most common form of Holocaust denial: downplay the scale, scope, and depravity so you can compare it to something/someone you disagree with. It’s as ridiculous as it is insane.
3113 2018-09-22 16:23:58 諦めるのはeasy
3114 2018-09-22 16:23:47 It’s was appropriately deleted. The tweet was saying I was calling for oil protesters lives to be lost. You liked the tweet Ken.
3115 2018-09-22 16:23:46 We never did find out whether Scotland could actually move seamlessly from the UK to EU, avoid joining Shengen, and balance a budget with oil below $90 per barrel, but let's remember it's called a losers referendum for a reason.
3116 2018-09-22 16:23:45 Oil in #biafraland His not #Nigeria and #Britain oil it's belong and blessed to biafrans...But now the owner of the land has came to get is land and is sovereignty to leave as human. #BIafra
3117 2018-09-22 16:23:16 Oil in lotion hada labo tu untuk skin type apa eh?
3118 2018-09-22 16:23:14 I doubt the animal word. He obviously went into too much projects too fast and when oil prices crashed and allocation got affected he was stuck in the middle. Bad planning but not like animals. Too much too soon
3119 2018-09-22 16:23:01 my coconut oil has solidified so it is officially fall
3120 2018-09-22 16:23:00 Oil spill today?
3121 2018-09-22 16:22:59 Sorry your destroying our public lands . We do not want them sold off for oil companies to plunder , or cattle to destroy our ecosystems. We do not want trophy hunting of our wolves and bears . You stand for everything that is wrong .

3124 2018-09-22 16:22:36 There is more than one olive press near me.  They are called Moulin d'huile and you take your olives, they press them and you get Fabrice's crap olive juice because the pipe is so long and your neighbour Mirabelle gets your and boasts to her neighbours abt her (my) olive oil.
3125 2018-09-22 16:22:33 Seriously. It looks like the dude just drank from a oil can
3126 2018-09-22 16:22:27 Just a reminder that the WH is trying to sell whole parcels of protected land to oil and mining companies. #NationalPublicLandsDay
3127 2018-09-22 16:22:21 Said it weeks ago and nothing has changed, Klefbom is the key to the Oilers season.
3128 2018-09-22 16:22:14 Money, oil!
3129 2018-09-22 16:21:59 Be thinking they know and done got jacked for an oil change 
3130 2018-09-22 16:21:37 Well, went to our club shop. Drained the oil from my Ford fiesta and changed the oil filter. 
Had a nice morning with the other geeks, literally talking shop, and went home again.
3131 2018-09-22 16:21:31 Another great day in Sardinia with wine tasting, olive oil and archaeology.
3132 2018-09-22 16:21:30 I disagree. But we will see. Bouchard has the skills. Bear defensively is Sketchy. But. Cost.
3133 2018-09-22 16:21:27 Westminster has about 20% eu has 100%  eu will rule Scotland under sturgeon and what will we export don't say oil gas or whisky we don't own them
3134 2018-09-22 16:21:25 Vamwe vafambira bar resipo ne bottle re cooking oil. Hakuna anedzaka kwana anga kiye madoor kumba kwake kufambira zvakadai.
3135 2018-09-22 16:21:23 I developed & tested proof of concept of a globally valid shared online market platform - initially for the oil market - in 1998 so yes indeed.
3136 2018-09-22 16:21:16 oil ang sinisi? hindi na si trump? ows...
3137 2018-09-22 16:20:54 Probably won’t pop as evenly because there’s like a thin film in between the bag itself that seems to have oil to help the kernels pop. Just a guess
3138 2018-09-22 16:20:41 Probably gonna hold breath until passes out.
3139 2018-09-22 16:20:34 @realDonaldTrump Our gas went up to regular unleaded to $2.99 per gallon the other grades past $3.00 on 9/20/2018 I hear your saying energy independent But our country's biggest oil executives are making a large profit on Cincinnati areas deplorables who's overseeing our oil?
3140 2018-09-22 16:20:32 Pink oil is one difficult oil to get tbh
3141 2018-09-22 16:20:29 Olive oil, yes. Olives, no
3142 2018-09-22 16:20:20 The noisy wheel gets the oil
3143 2018-09-22 16:20:17 Which would make perfect sense
3144 2018-09-22 16:19:55 Bear will start in AHL and don't expect Bouchard to get more than his 9-game look see.
3145 2018-09-22 16:19:24 Weirdo Heid imo. Can you imagine getting stuck in the elevator with him clamped on to you? What's he got your dog Barney's face on his profile for.. oh no hang on... don't answer that!!
3146 2018-09-22 16:19:23 Great debate but had to mute it when Cruz talked. He sounded like a snake oil salesman. Didn’t like that smirk on his face. He only showed that he can’t be trusted. Time for a change. You have our vote.

3150 2018-09-22 16:19:04 Oil is up more than 50% over the past year.
The wall was projected to cost $12Billion...how much of it did we get for $1.6 Billion?
Not much...a laugher actually.
Who's watching the henhouse?
Morning Kamala!!
3151 2018-09-22 16:18:59 #Iranian #oil exports began to drop noticeably in #August as some of #Iran’s biggest customers began to reduce or cut completely their purchases, in order to comply with incoming #US sanctions on Iran, which aim to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero.
Iran’s sales on (1/10)
3152 2018-09-22 16:18:59 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
3153 2018-09-22 16:18:52 @Pulse2MDL Today shows how bad things had got. I believe we a showing signs of recovery but its a long long road to get back to where we were. Keep supporting #bcafc and it will turn round, like an oil tanker but it will turn, eventually.
3154 2018-09-22 16:18:34 Hahahaha.  Truffle oil isn’t even made out of real truffles.
3155 2018-09-22 16:18:29 There must be a press near you, get them made into oil.
3156 2018-09-22 16:18:09 I doubt that any Ahwazi group is behind the attack: a) there’s still no official statement regarding this yet b) All Ahwazi attacks in the past years have targeted oil pipes only. Attacks targetin
3157 2018-09-22 16:18:01 Hot oil treatments & oil treatments overnight. So like the night before you wash your hair add your favorite oils to scalp and let it marinate overnight & wash it out the next morning.
3158 2018-09-22 16:17:48 Are all the Bengali mums same ? My mum poured mustard oil in a green water bottle bruh and I had this spicy curry so I ran to the kitchen and found the bottle and just drank half of it thought it was water in it  
3159 2018-09-22 16:17:46 Bloody barbarians. When non oil producing regions have this religious tyranny forced upon their countries will never succeed in the world. They will remain the 3rd world forever
3160 2018-09-22 16:17:38 I like to jog around the neighborhood! Its great to get some fresh air before your start the day, it really helps with concentration~
3161 2018-09-22 16:17:37 I don’t really use oil or potatoes in cooking if I’m honest. These days it’s all green and white veg and decent meat. I’m losing weight steadily!

3169 2018-09-22 16:16:02 CBD is a LIFE SAVER. I suffer from PCOS and my cramps and headaches were out of this world terrible. 
I personally prefer the oil/lotion. I've smoked a CBD joint and it made me lightheaded but didn't help with my issues as much.

3175 2018-09-22 16:15:43 LED products will again cost too much. Normal people will be forced to purchase incandescent higher wattage bulbs, which in turn funds oil and gas. The wealthy win again. #RESIST

3181 2018-09-22 16:14:44 My mova said she was gonna buy me a tv for my bday I said naw just pay for oil change
3182 2018-09-22 16:14:42 Yeah, you should try neem and almond oil, both are really good for allergies
3183 2018-09-22 16:14:33 They call baby oil baby oil not because you put it on babies, but because it desolves condoms and makes babies.
3184 2018-09-22 16:14:28 With a little salad undressing.. and olive oil.
3185 2018-09-22 16:14:27 With overheated oil.
3186 2018-09-22 16:14:19 Mine from Belgium but think you can pick one up for ~£30. I just sieve the oil and use it for cooking. Am sure this is illegal or carcinogenic but hey, we’re all going to die and we might as well die having eaten fried food.

3193 2018-09-22 16:14:02 Oil is very important helps lubricate, clean and cool the engine and reduces engine wear and tear

3197 2018-09-22 16:13:53 Went for an oil change ended up paying for 4 different things smh
3198 2018-09-22 16:13:53 Use 1 to dry your bike. One to wipe excess oil off the chain. Etc. :)

3205 2018-09-22 16:13:13 Thank you! That’s much appreciated!  I had to tell her I’m not opting out of surgery, though, which I think pissed her off a bit. I’m all for work & treatment, and that’s happening for sure, but no way am I putting a crystal on my breast and a little oil and calling it done lol
3206 2018-09-22 16:12:58 Car getting its Oil Change then pulling up on my bro 
3207 2018-09-22 16:12:45 electric is simple. keep it simple. why didn't we think of this long ago? could it be that oil companies are based on deception, and in the light of day, oil companies collapse like a house of cards?
3208 2018-09-22 16:12:39 Exciting development. I already lather my little guy in coconut oil after baths instead of baby oil.
3209 2018-09-22 16:12:33 Put your website in your Twitter profile .Your must have info to make easy for people to contact you for orders!
3210 2018-09-22 16:12:31 Right after the break-up of the USSR, a co. for which I worked sent a team to examine Sov. industry for potential investment. A co-worker told me of flying over swampy land w/ oil rigs & commenting that it looked like S. Louisiana. He was told--except it's crude oil & not water!
3211 2018-09-22 16:12:29 Spot on! I don't want to go to war, change my oil, fix the water heater! I want to do laundry, cook supper and take care of my family. Men are men &women are women. I'm so sick of these women that make women look bad. How embarrassing!

3216 2018-09-22 16:11:39 Try deep conditioning hair masks once a week, or use it instead of conditioner everyday. Leave it on for at least 15 mins. Argan oil would be great too.  Spread it through damp hair & dry normally. Ironing/curling/blow-drying dries the hair so avoid if possible.

3219 2018-09-22 16:11:22 @ToyotaConicelli As per their customer service, they used Full synthetic blend for the first two services and then changed it to synthetic blend during 3rd one. Still hard to understand why they changed it without informing and now asking again to come back for oil change...

3222 2018-09-22 16:10:49 Delicious recipe. I am even thinking all the ingredients would make a delicious salad. Had a variety of greens  add rest of ingredients then toss salad with the mustard and a little olive oil. Add cut up pieces of the soft pretzel.
3223 2018-09-22 16:10:47 Just wait. They will find a way soon to bring "democracy" to Venezuela. i.e.- Take their oil.

3233 2018-09-22 16:10:09 There are a lot of luteras in this oil transaction, our state Government and oil pumps owner s are exploiting every minutes, it is showing our helpless ness
3234 2018-09-22 16:10:07 For me. OK and Larsson. Nurse with Bouchard. Benning with Russel. Bear my 7th. Why Bear and Russel. Both will bring passion. Energy. Youth. You draft these RH dmen. You develope them. Either in the AHL or NHL. Both are cheap options. If both succeed you are laughing.

3237 2018-09-22 16:09:56 Also, how do you dispose of your used oil. Seriously my biggest first world problem.
3238 2018-09-22 16:09:51 The countries and cultures of the Middle East have been doing just fine without the US for thousands of years. We need their oil because we have become dependent. Learn to play nice in other people’s sandbox.
3239 2018-09-22 16:09:49 Ageed but the issue Joe is that @reuters in a dumb haste to pump out a flashy headline claimed sources told them a 1/2m bpd was being discussed causing the oil market to plummet-they should be held to account for once for assisting in undermining the integrity of the market
3240 2018-09-22 16:09:47 All of us Italians have olive oil running through our veins

Car Place: Great...oh what’s this? Looks like you’re due for an air filter replacement, tire rotation, transmission repair, a NEW ENGINE. Matter of fact why don’t we just get you a whole NEW CAR! We’ll get you over to sales and you can talk numbers
3244 2018-09-22 16:09:28 If you don't change your own oil but you can change a tire, you're good. 

You don't get a pass for eating boneless wings, though.

3256 2018-09-22 16:08:31 remember a time when a "leader" a "great orator" would hold rallys where he would lie-rant & rave about the Brethren. In a world of 100's of millions of people.... this one thrives on the 1 million that has been decieved by a bribe, by greedy,dangerous,shrewd, snake oil salesman
3257 2018-09-22 16:08:26 Once thought I could “wait it out” and heal myself up, got down into my lungs, became resistant to antibiotics, and even spawned a skin infection. Stupid decision on my part. 2 months of university completely gone.
3258 2018-09-22 16:08:25 First day off in 40 days.... oil change, pay bills, and mow the grass. Fuck
3259 2018-09-22 16:08:16 Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine, so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire.
3260 2018-09-22 16:08:09 Sure Putin told him to Kick out 60 Russian Spies and to put the strongest Sanctions ever on Russia as well as cutting off the flow of gas and oil to Eastern Europe. I am sure Putin is thrilled with all President Trump has done to hurt the Russian economy.

3264 2018-09-22 16:07:49 The type of stain and canvas color matter. Oil based? Water? Just dirt?

I've had quite a few pairs of Chuck Ts. They survived many cleaning agents including baking soda, vinegar, various stain pens, laundry detergents, etc. But the canvas was black and colorfast.
3265 2018-09-22 16:07:43 ふだんととくらいしか自分から漁りにいかないからそれ以外のカプみると新鮮な気持ちになる
3266 2018-09-22 16:07:37 Rediced increase in trade does not equate to lower oil consumption. It equates to lower growth in oil consumption. BIG DIFFERENCE.

Same applies to the elimination of low interest rates.
3267 2018-09-22 16:07:29 I'm changing my oil rn.
3268 2018-09-22 16:07:19 @ToyotaConicelli Back in Feb 18 When declined 30,000 mile service and asked for only oil change, they changed it with synthetic blend instead of full blend without informing and now again i received maintenance reminder sign and called them and they said its due for oil change.

3274 2018-09-22 16:06:52 The other factor is that there is a desire by TM to start the season with set lines.Or at least pairings. Conner/RNH. Drai/Reider. Strome/JP. KB/SUpshall.
3275 2018-09-22 16:06:51 Serious question- If i bring my oil field buddies to San Antonio one weekend who is going to show us a good time?
3276 2018-09-22 16:06:49 We are not lost. The ANC train is derailed. We will fix it, no doubt. Bet while it is stuck, we oil the @BLF_SouthAfrica machine.

3279 2018-09-22 16:06:39 So 2017 production drop due to NA and sanctions toxification looks plausible. But 2016 flexion pt due to oil price drop? Chart 1 shows precipitous drop since mid 2014 and rebound starting Q2 2016, so low price point Q1 2016 is short-lived and doesn’t seem to be strong explanation

3284 2018-09-22 16:06:19 @SpookyWoobler hey man i feel for ya. From one kris to another i hope you at least feel better. Have you tried weed or frankincense oil? Thats known to shrink cancerous moles and tumers.
3285 2018-09-22 16:06:19 If this were the only thing they were insane about, I'd be fine with it.

But they whine about SO much. It's tiring.
3286 2018-09-22 16:06:17 I need a oil change 
3287 2018-09-22 16:06:15 Hehe.  Couple that with my Flax seed oil and I’ll be morning machine gun.. pass the espresso

3289 2018-09-22 16:06:12 Actually you guys sure are positive Cruz is not going to be re-elected. See that report that is from the Permian Basin the most conservative counties in TX and we are huge. The restrictions Obama put upon us were taken off allowing oil and gas to boom again. So thanks Cruz
3290 2018-09-22 16:06:01 Zinke puts oil before our beautiful National Parks and chopped the parks up so they could be polluted by his oil and mining friends. He even let foreign mining companies take some of our park land. Vote Blue to reinstate our nat'l parks to preTrump sizes.

BTW, @BetoORourke wiped the floor with you.
3299 2018-09-22 16:05:15 Yeah. He called me yesterday and was asking about my last oil change. He said there was zero oil on the dip stick and when he drained it, it was extremely thick. He thinks it was never actually changed
3300 2018-09-22 16:05:14 Last night I hung eucalyptus leaves in my shower bc the steam and oil from the leaves are suppose to be bomb for your skin and that’s cool and everything but it also has my bathroom/room  smelling soooo good 
3301 2018-09-22 16:05:11 Oh my days that’s awful... I’m sending hugs... try cbd oil or evening primrose for the long term... your daughter has all my hugs.

3304 2018-09-22 16:05:02 I can see where our GA will be significantly improved. PK should be at least 20% better at home. Health OK and a veteran third line should help. KB should be a real help along with Upshall. Need a guy who can fly. Mcleod?
3305 2018-09-22 16:04:58 Oh thats brilliant. Perhaps Alan is in one of those doors ..Leave him in there.
Did you realise his profile picture is of my Barney....all very strange.
3306 2018-09-22 16:04:54 Aku gatel2 dan redness ampunya pake ricebran+jojoba oil. Sampe ilang seilang-ilangnya. Dan sejujurnya aku gatau yg berperan itu ricebran atau jojoba oil.
3307 2018-09-22 16:04:44 lol the oil change lady looked at the 15 pack and tacobell in my passenger seat and said “breakfast of champions right there.” 
3308 2018-09-22 16:04:40 One thing I can say is I will always be GREAT! Good great night with the fam, good great night after and woke up on some good great stuff and  gramps is blessing me with an oil change... ALWAYS GREAT

3313 2018-09-22 16:04:10 I constantly had strep until my mom had my tonsils removed at 12 years old.  Mine never got that far out of hand, though.
3314 2018-09-22 16:04:04 I'm surprised they haven't gone after the thumbs up sign.
3315 2018-09-22 16:04:01 Numerous indigenous groups support the pipeline. To check a yes or no box in your analysis is silly. Many argue of economic harm of not building the pipeline. Plus it covers a route where there is an existing pipeline. You can be a dipper and believe in oil.
3316 2018-09-22 16:04:00 Thereafter they will need sufficient food and tons of oil to re-attack. The loan may be sanctioned but will never be repaid.

3319 2018-09-22 16:03:29 Truthfully do you know anything about West TX or the oil boom ? During Obama's last term we all went bankrupt out here, jobs left, foreclosures left and right, people left by droves, since Trump removed so many restrictions its booming again.
3320 2018-09-22 16:03:27 I need to get my oil changed lol

3330 2018-09-22 16:02:16 Let me go on to say that for this government to take us out of recession shows that we as Nigerians heard the call and we took action. Now people are paying taxes and other industries are waxing stronger so we don't depend on oil in the nearest future. Between both of us...

3386 2018-09-21 23:56:34 Odd that you concentrate on Greece which has never been other than an olive oil and baskets economy. The real villainy of the EU during the crash was visited on Ireland. Have a look. I think you’ll be quite shocked.
3387 2018-09-21 23:56:26 That's true I guess, but if tea tree oil works sclareol might be a more efficient alternative for people having easy access to it.

3392 2018-09-21 23:55:46 so
since we've established that olive oil is for, like
italian and greek food?

i'm going to rub the porkchops with... butter?
grapeseed oil is apparently just neutral, which I'm assuming means that modern grapeseed oil is *canola oil* and has undergone the debitterification

3397 2018-09-21 23:54:54 If Cruz is elected, he'll fight to raise your fuel prices and give Big Oil more free reign price gouging.
3398 2018-09-21 23:54:44 I'm not a slather-er. I use a little, non-trendy olive oil or non-trendy mayo. . .
3399 2018-09-21 23:54:40 China not going to give up their pipeline without a fight.  They NEED that oil.
3400 2018-09-21 23:54:34 Am not discussing the pipeline when talking about the high gas prices which didn't go down even though promised they would after the refinery reopened.  Am def. not pro-any pipeline in BC due to the inevitable leaks, more oil freighters, disturbing marine life in our BC oceans.
3401 2018-09-21 23:54:25 Millie loves pumpkin and chickpeas? Also have found her just licking the side of the container of olive oil.
3402 2018-09-21 23:54:06 There’s really no legitimate studies on the matter but, anecdotally, I vape  a 2:1 thc/cbd oil in bed, every night, right next to my husband. He’s never gotten remotely high - not even a tiny bit.
3403 2018-09-21 23:54:03 He always comes to Midland cuz thats where the oil money is

3405 2018-09-21 23:53:39 None of these will make any difference. California is proof. We have all of these and we still have similar levels of violence as places that don't. Don't be fooled by snake oil folks. These ideas won't do anything but affect law abiding citizens.
3406 2018-09-21 23:53:35 R u serious when you are talking about #Greenpeace in #Iraq!? Iraq like Alberta both r relying on oil to support #government's income. But the difference Iraq does not care about the environment so government gains income and revenue, whereas #Alberta is care about... You know!
3407 2018-09-21 23:53:08 changed my oil and made a huge fuckin mess
3408 2018-09-21 23:52:44 I personally do not feel any psychoactive effects with my 20:1 . For that reason I really enjoy my 1:1 oil because the high is so pleasant and comfy.
3409 2018-09-21 23:52:44 Google strawberry chutney ! And then change it around ! I also sweated doen onion and garlic in mustard oil then put in 4 cups of sliced strawberries with baharat spice (any hot would work) and melted it for half an hour- delicious !
3410 2018-09-21 23:52:42 Gotta say, Cruz is one hell of a snake oil salesman #TXSenateDebate

3412 2018-09-21 23:51:53 To have somewhere else to sell our oil . They buy ours at $30ish refine it and sell it back $1.30 litre and $70 a barrel. So all you whining about the patch get ready for a long drought . Who will invest at $ 33 a barrel when they can get $70. kenney did nothing in 10 years
3413 2018-09-21 23:51:37 ちょっとしゃんできる？
3414 2018-09-21 23:51:28 Since when are snake oil salesman like Graham qualified to offer legal opinions on what’s a crime or not?

3418 2018-09-21 23:51:02 O'Rourke is talking about the massive piles of cash that big corporations are sitting on. Would've been fairly easy to pivot to Big Oil here and how tax breaks to big corporations harm the planet. #TXSenateDebate

3420 2018-09-21 23:50:04 She’s not “vaping weed.” She’s vaping CBD oil. NEITHER of them are getting high, secondary or otherwise.

Beyond that, it would be incredibly difficult to get a secondhand high by being in proximity to someone vaping cannibis oil. The cloud dissipates extremely fast.
3421 2018-09-21 23:49:32 Gotta keep the oil changed or them rods and pistons get all clogged up.
3422 2018-09-21 23:49:31 This is what’s wrong with society & causes so much abuse, bullying, insecurities, etc...people like this judging others and giving plastic surgery advise. No oil painting yourself. Oh and beauty also comes from within, What nasty shallow pair of pricks.

3424 2018-09-21 23:49:15 Same, lavender and tea tree oil all day
3425 2018-09-21 23:48:37 How about investing those billions into solar cities or wind?

Much better than fat dumb oil execs who don't care.

Stupid plan.

3427 2018-09-21 23:47:56 Shut up all you Partisans Albertans that are putting your province down when it needs to be supported so we can get more than $ 35 bucks a barrel for our oil . But no you idiots think little kenney will change things , no he won’t he’s funded by American oil they don’t want us
3428 2018-09-21 23:47:56 It’s like old oil, right? Same here. I just split it up throughout the day
3429 2018-09-21 23:47:35 It's definitely me though because my full initials are actually DCC  -- Detective Comics Comics. Plus, Donny abdicated his position when he signed that Marvel exclusive. He can challenge me for ownership in the turkish tradition of olive oil wrestling in 4 yrs time
3430 2018-09-21 23:47:30 It is also why the #UK is blocking separation of #Barqah/#Cyrenaica as such action would be a stabilizing factor in the entire area but would not be what #MuslimBrotherhood demands - control of oil money to fill their coffers

3433 2018-09-21 23:46:56 I will be doing ghetto massage out of my apartment during my vacation.  Set your own price, it must be able to at least cover the massage oil and lotion.
3434 2018-09-21 23:46:56 Is it like argan oil? I am having some luck with that.
3435 2018-09-21 23:46:54 To bleach or not to bleach, that is the question.  
Am I ready for a new look, a lot of hot oil treatment a hair cut? Yass!
3436 2018-09-21 23:46:52 One word of caution.
Don't use this tumeric/coconut oil toothpaste just before going out.

It makes your tongue yellow for a while.
3437 2018-09-21 23:46:47 Oil prices must fall to move the economy foward or the market will fall! Remember 2009 market crash, high gas prices!

Hell, they'll even occupy Wall St. 1/
3442 2018-09-21 23:46:02 Coconut oil actually does help with heartburns. Thank goodness.
3443 2018-09-21 23:46:00 changed my own oil today so I guess you could say I'm masc

3447 2018-09-21 23:45:54 Snake oil salesman doing what he does 
3448 2018-09-21 23:45:54 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3449 2018-09-21 23:45:49 My very Republican inlaws support marijuana reform. They have every legal product for pain etc that you can get in TX, and have used the oil I make for my disabled wife. Cruz is out of touch on this issue.
3450 2018-09-21 23:45:29 I think I hate Ted Cruz more than Trump. Ted Cruz ought to know better, and is a weasel by choice. A Harvard education wasted on an oil puddle.
3451 2018-09-21 23:45:26 Ole Beto is selling his positions like a classic snake oil salesman.  Ignore my voting record and just listen to what I’m saying  #TXSenDebate
3452 2018-09-21 23:45:10 For aftercare, try using a massage oil

3456 2018-09-21 23:44:44 After you do it use shea moisture Jamaican castor oil hair masque, it’s really good
3457 2018-09-21 23:44:22 Started to watch the cruz / Beto debate. Cruz makes my skin crawl. Had to turn it off.  I thought Beto held his own without all@the oil dripping out of his mouth
3458 2018-09-21 23:44:20 It's a peppermint oil kind of night I wish it wasn't. Not having an omentum messes my system up that much more. Hoping I CAN take care of others soon.
3459 2018-09-21 23:44:07 They usually have coupons online and the oil change is anywhere from $15-$20
3460 2018-09-21 23:44:02 i literally just washed your hair & put some conditioner in it, imma add some pink oil and twist it for 2mar .
3461 2018-09-21 23:43:54 Because he's a snake oil salesman until proven different.

Brewster had this same act and look where that got the team.

Certainly hope the best for PJ & the Goofs but lets now anoint the man the savior of the program because of some silly slogan.
3462 2018-09-21 23:43:51 Where the oil at?  @sfa_ques
3463 2018-09-21 23:43:50 This dude on the bus is my space and reeks weed and coconut oil??,,, WTF

3465 2018-09-21 23:43:39 Yeah but it illustrates a selective morality,  hypocrisy and ulterior motives #oil #GasPipeline #Gold #PetroDollar #Destabilization  .  #Saudis  or do you still believe in operation Iraqi freedom. Freedom from their lives, their families, their homes, their culture.
3466 2018-09-21 23:43:38 The first 2 kinds of CBD oil did nothing. The last one is working I believe, of course, it's the most expensive. Been on it for 6 weeks. I will be off it for a few weeks to confirm it's helping. It's hard to know what is in the different CBD oils.
3467 2018-09-21 23:43:34 If you think u need oil to cook bacon you’re a dumb birch
3468 2018-09-21 23:42:54 I've never thought of it from the perspective of them trying to get their hands on oil dollars. I've just assumed tax dollars. Makes TOTAL sense, though. Interesting. Thank you. 
3469 2018-09-21 23:42:50 My scalp is trash. I keep developing what it feels like to be scabs. No matter how much I wash, moisturize and oil my hair. Do I go to a dermatologist for this?
3470 2018-09-21 23:42:42 Try 1 part coconut oil 
1 part sea salt.
2 parts powered tumeric.

Put a little on a toothbrush, bush your teeth, swish it around your mouth for a few minutes, then swallow.

I read somewhere that taking tumeric with oil helps your body absorb a higher %.

3472 2018-09-21 23:42:32 Who would be applying for one anyway, with our current over-supply of oil in the province. Have a path for take-away and then go for it.

3489 2018-09-21 23:40:18 Alberta needs to have a vote to seperate from Canada! Then the East & BC can start paying world price for our oil!

Now if there is a global dollar shortage China is the ONLY other country that can continue to but oil without having to puke up, what may be at that time, dollars that are dear globally.This is a game changer and everyone from Pentagon on down knows it and has acknowledged it
3496 2018-09-21 23:39:04 Good for them. I wish they would build another rail line to the coast just for oil cars. 
3497 2018-09-21 23:38:54 Susan Riley, you are too dug in against oil and pipelines.  Yes, the world needs to get off oil, but it is going to be a gradual process. In the meantime we need to get that bitumen to market
3498 2018-09-21 23:38:53 Thank goodness! Perhaps the oil moved on ya late in that game
3499 2018-09-21 23:38:45 I need my oil changed and a car wash

@madibonnn like oil?
3503 2018-09-21 23:38:14 I think it’s only legal in the pill form or oil form but it could be prescription only.
3504 2018-09-21 23:38:02 There will still be some manner of petroleum industry in 50 years. Alberta is still reliant on oil and gas, though solar is starting to gain popularity.

Provincial economies can't turn on a dime. A slow, sustainable transition towards greener energy is the way to go, IMHO.

3510 2018-09-21 23:37:17 There is no evidence whatever to this claim. It's from the same stable as the 'Iran Oil Bourse' meme.

We get plenty of snow in the winter.  Also, without mining and oil, how do you propose to build these solar panels? Unicorns?

3520 2018-09-21 23:35:29 "Leo Varadkar was alleged to have begged [May] to produce a finished plan to take pressure off him from opponents in Dublin."

Why should Britain help that snake oil salesman after all the poison and fuel he's poured on the fire?
3521 2018-09-21 23:35:20 What time might that be ? I would need to go by the store because he told me to bring some oil so he can do my oil change but he said I can go to a gas station and get some
3522 2018-09-21 23:35:17 yes....I had the 71.14 as resistance because yesterday a passive señler was filling at that price. 70.98 (above VWAP) I saw guys getting out in my T&S (hitting the bid at market). Anyway a high volatility day. ..  Lots of factors hitting the oil market fundamentals.
3523 2018-09-21 23:35:16 So basically, Evangelicals aren’t really Christians. They are snake oil salesmen who are just in it for the money. 

I think I get it now, I was expecting them to have some morality and decency. My mistake!
3524 2018-09-21 23:35:07 When are they going to start drilling for oil?
3525 2018-09-21 23:35:01 I would make a greek dish vegetarian dish which is green beans trimmed and put in a saucepan with lots of garlic half a cup of olive oil tin of chopped of toms parsley mix together and cook for about 45 mins to an hour. If no juices left add some water.

3537 2018-09-21 23:33:53 Problem is, the GOP's Iran sanctions deal coming up is not going to bode well for oil prices. With the short comings in supply as we speak, isn't that Iran deal you're proposing going to make oil prices even higher? I am not well read on these sanctions, but that's what I hear.

3585 2018-09-21 23:24:30 The Feminists must think Americans are all stupid enough to fall for the snake oil they're peddling!
3586 2018-09-21 23:24:22 I started watching Occupied, which is about Norway being occupied after shutting off its oil supply to its neighbours. It's pretty good so far.
Babylon Berlin was really good. Maybe my favourite show of the year.
I'm also interested in All Quiet in Peking and Magnificent Century.
3587 2018-09-21 23:24:16 Beto is kicking ass, IMO. He’s intelligent. Cruz is such an ICK. I dislike him immensely. Snake oil salesmen. Beto knows that.
3588 2018-09-21 23:24:07 #BB20 4:13 pm BBT.  Tyler puts a pan on the stove and puts some oil in it.  Kaycee is up and talks to Tyler in the KT for a minute.  He is cooking the chicken and cleaning up, disinfecting the counter as he should.
3589 2018-09-21 23:24:04 Taking 3.5 mL of undiluted oil can be fatal. Signs of eucalyptus poisoning might include stomach pain and burning, dizziness, muscle weakness, small eye pupils, feelings of suffocation, and some others. Eucalyptus oil can also cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
3590 2018-09-21 23:23:59 You see we have oil, other mineral resources and we have fertile land.
3591 2018-09-21 23:23:35 I went into Sam’s Club for toilet tissue, paper towels, and olive oil. 

I spent $214.87.
3592 2018-09-21 23:23:27 @realDonaldTrump The refineries in China and India will be ready to cut off oil exports until November. When President Trump's success is completed, no country will pump oil from Iran in November, and this will be great work.
3593 2018-09-21 23:23:16 I’m finally getting a oil change it’s been almost a year, what is wrong with me.
3594 2018-09-21 23:23:11 Chuck.  Taking @google = socialism.  
 
O+ the cornerstone of Venezuela’s state owned property is a huge oil co.  @exxonmobil will never surrender to US.

NB: You should call your teachers and complain about your crap education.
3595 2018-09-21 23:23:10 I'm not one trying to pass off the blame of my country killing innocent people like you are. Have fun in SA once the oil money runs out and you start killing each other and not your neighbors.
3596 2018-09-21 23:23:01 @realDonaldTrump President Trump has done more of his election promises, only the destruction of extreme Islamic terrorism has survived. The promise will be met with full oil and bank sanctions.
3597 2018-09-21 23:22:29 Y'all. In just the last two days I got a job, accepted to ucr's winter quarter, a oil change, & booked another shoot. I'm really proud right now. Haha
3598 2018-09-21 23:22:22 Stop giving them foreign aid.  Stop buying there gas, and oil. Send them a bill for us protecting them and rebuilding there country for the last fifty years.. Use the money saved to build our wall.  Expence   money saved to National Security America First Account. Problem solved!
3599 2018-09-21 23:22:04 usa army is the same shit as blackwater mercs, protecting oil in foreign countries, protecting opium fields in Afghanistan, training alqaeda-daesh in Syria, no simpathy for iraqui child killers, I really hope she gets cancer from depleted uranium dropped frm the scum usa airforce
3600 2018-09-21 23:22:01 Use castor oil to help the strength and growth of your lashes!!!
3601 2018-09-21 23:21:44 Always have this in the place:
Instant ramen
Sesame oil
Red pepper flakes

You'll never, ever wonder again. Always remember that a little sesame oil goes a looooooong way.
3602 2018-09-21 23:21:42 New tires and an oil change 
3603 2018-09-21 23:21:32 here's a recipe for baking the damn things, and you can do veggies, too

sure don't have olive oil though lmfao
grapeseed oil and butter
's it
3604 2018-09-21 23:21:30 I was planning on a sexy weekend with my love, but instead I get to change the oil, replace the toilet, and deliver a pizza.

On second thought, I think she wants to make a porno.
3605 2018-09-21 23:21:15 We can negotiate a price if you will work a 10k+ round trip on the board in the red minidress.  Video with valid time stamps required. (I don’t need to say void without appropriate supporting garments...floor hands will take care of that issue).
3606 2018-09-21 23:21:09 And fYI we have oil in the lake Chad region of the north in commercial quantity if you don't know. Plus the FG will kick start the exploration of oil and building oil refinery in collaboration with Niger republic in Katsina.
3607 2018-09-21 23:21:01 I believe diversification is the key to job creation. We cannot depend on oil forever. For those in that field retraining for a new career is a key if the jobs are gone.
3608 2018-09-21 23:20:54 The world has always had a glut of oil , it’s all controlled by trump little friends you the ones that blew up the trade center . Saudis
3609 2018-09-21 23:20:43 @Iansharkey42 was there some oil match on tonight 
3610 2018-09-21 23:20:34 Alaskans own 37,700 shares of WESTERN ENERGY SERVICES CORP, worth $66,713. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in CANADA.

3613 2018-09-21 23:19:53 "hi I need oil for my car, i think it takes SAE oil"

3614 2018-09-21 23:19:37 See "Energy Victory" by @robert_zubrin, "Turning Oil Into Salt" by Luft & Korin etc. Key is making flex fuel capability a standard feature
3615 2018-09-21 23:19:36 No need to change your cleanser if you think your cleanser are fine. Try do a cold towel method. And apply tea tree oil and acne mask.

3620 2018-09-21 23:19:01 Don't the republican's already work for them?  Do you see nothing wrong with that mentality? You start wars over oil. You starve people and deprive them of their human rights all for oil.  Without you there would be no war and no pollution that clogs our air and waterways. Evil.
3621 2018-09-21 23:18:51 @ashlyn_brady send help. And annointing oil.
3622 2018-09-21 23:18:46 There's no demand for #tarsands. @jkenney tweeting about "India needs oil" is a joke. They have solar streets and gutters in India. India s transitioning off #fossilfuels. Everyone's transitioning to #renewables; it's has been @UN + @OECD policy for over a decade. #AbLeg #cdnpoli
3623 2018-09-21 23:18:40 Dá zero pra ele Anterâo...
3624 2018-09-21 23:18:34 GET SOME OIL ON THAT THING PRONTO.
3625 2018-09-21 23:18:34 XD I know for mine I just remove the front passenger tire and remove the plastic panel and the filter is there along with the oil drain bolt. Omg we have this ford I want to change the spark plugs and basically I have to take the top of the engine apart -_-
3626 2018-09-21 23:18:30 I'm always shocked when I see peeps say what a great debater Cruz is. I think he sounds like a proselytizing snake oil salesman. Meanwhile Beto gives vibes of past great orators

3630 2018-09-21 23:16:43 The best part of going to the beach is the COASTLINE  Big Oil & Gas MORONS  obviously never roasted marshmallows at the beach, or snuggled under blankets  while watching a full moon upon quite waves.

3631 2018-09-21 23:16:40 #Canadians are oil hungry citizens in denial. 

As a country we consume about 2.4 Million bbls/day. 

25 bbls/person each year.

We choose to forego a national energy strategy that embraces environmentalism on a global scale, so that we can pretend we’re making a difference.
3632 2018-09-21 23:16:39 Classes are back in action! Today we started with an autumn lesson blending oil pastels and we talked about warm colors #banyancreekelementary
3633 2018-09-21 23:16:39 The SOS effect Sugar, Oil (fats), Salt.
3634 2018-09-21 23:16:36 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3635 2018-09-21 23:16:28 ワンチャンカラオケオールナイト
3636 2018-09-21 23:16:25 That was my main problem! I couldn't get any tool to the oil filter because of a huge plastic panel blocking it from the fan belt. And all the screws holding it on were hidden by other car parts. I almost took a hacksaw to the damn thing :x
3637 2018-09-21 23:16:24 Maybe also because line 9 did get oil to tidewater and so their statement was inaccurate.

Montreal was not technically a new market in the sense that we were occasionally supplying it by rail before line 9 reversal.

TMX isn't really a new market either.  Gateway and EE were.
3638 2018-09-21 23:16:21 The republicans do work for the oil and gas lobbyists. Their hearts are as black as the crude oil they drink with their dinner.  Shut them down. They want to play, it's time for them to pay. War for oil rights. It's disgusting.
3639 2018-09-21 23:16:19 Alaye, japaa fast! That babe is sneaking in a strong prong that fits more than yours with good oil pan to reduce the heat!  Make money, there are more than enough wonderful girls around! She fit be one ugly katongo thing like dat o 
3640 2018-09-21 23:16:17 Unless your job is running a province primarily reliant on oil and gas and you're trying to get people working as you climb out of a recession that's kind of changed the whole game.
3641 2018-09-21 23:16:02 When my father passed away in 2008 all people came to his funeral told me that you must be proud of your father, because without of what he and his friends did we wouldn't get this benefits from the oil we wouldn't get this life

3642 2018-09-21 23:15:52 Ain’t no one coming when our oil sells for $33 a barrel and everyone else’s is $65-75
3643 2018-09-21 23:15:42 What’s everyone’s problem if money goes back to the province it came out of? I get it sucks paying more,I’m sure isn’t the first new tax ever. Give it a shot see if it doe reduce emissions or monies go Into worthwhile projects green energy will be the future oil has to run out
3644 2018-09-21 23:15:38 Getting tea tree oil in your eye feels like an Extra Strong peppermint sweet dissolving in your eye socket very slowly.
3645 2018-09-21 23:15:24 Pricing just released and OMG!!! YOU want to be a customer now.. like NOW!!!! HURRY  1 hour left to get signed up and get the oil and the cream in a pack or a price that will drop your jaw!

3647 2018-09-21 23:15:04 Oil, water, and (a third liquid) in a clear bottle is a classic.

3649 2018-09-21 23:14:54 David Birnbaum (Parti Libéral du Québec) notes climate change may be the biggest problem facing Quebec and the world. Birnbaum stresses a local focus, severing dependence on oil, and promoting sustainable transportation. #ConcordiaDebate
3650 2018-09-21 23:14:40 "Metro Vancouver has the highest fuel taxes in Canada, but don't blame those taxes for high fuel prices." This makes no sense at all, and then blames Big Oil for fundamental supply constraints in SW BC.
3651 2018-09-21 23:14:37 Han Han stop lying now... .
.. Which one is you don't like Sharwama because of the palm oil inside.., ....

3652 2018-09-21 23:14:37 Oil may be up in the stock market, but Arkansas doesn’t have the high state taxes like New York or CA. I’m grateful for that  so the 2.59 range still looks good to me. I’d like to see ethanol used in gasoline and soybean oil in diesel. 
3653 2018-09-21 23:14:30 Get an oil pen
3654 2018-09-21 23:14:13 Omg girl use coconut oil as ur makeup remover,, does wonders!

3656 2018-09-21 23:13:56 My dog gets dermatitis and it gets better when we give him a Tbsp of coconut oil in his food. Benadryl also seems to help, but hydrocortisone doesn't do much
3657 2018-09-21 23:13:51 But but now the world has gone beyond govt we need to think outside the box, one day oil is not gonna be relevant and all the juicy money u guys get from the south will stop what is the way forward? The south are thinking outside the box innovating new things and creating jobs
3658 2018-09-21 23:13:44 I agree with you 100 percent
But the problem I have with brexit specifically is that people didn’t know what they were voting for .
And in the US a snake oil salesman struck at the perfect time .
Do you really think no matter how corrupt Hillary is , she would be worse this
3659 2018-09-21 23:13:38 Triple false. I take mine with oil and mayo! #phillysh*t

3661 2018-09-21 23:13:31 Good marketing move too seeing as how every person I see in an oil kings jersey is wearing a fix-wolansky jersey
3662 2018-09-21 23:13:25 Oddly most have treatment . After years of smoking drinking and pain killers most of u don’t have organs fit2 fight cancers! Hence treatment  hurts you( often have to kill good and bad cells) then they use cbd & don’t realise the treatment worked , but praise CBD oil as less pain
3663 2018-09-21 23:13:15 Thank you!
3664 2018-09-21 23:13:08 Sure. And Trump is a stable genius. Our leaders will do what’s right for Canadians. We may hurt in the short terms but it’s a global world. We can sell our oil and lumber to Europe and Asia today. Our manufacturers have been finding new markets. Our ag products are sought after:
3665 2018-09-21 23:13:03 Probably. Quick snatch & grab a from unlocked garages are common in my area. Funniest was cops stopping a kid on a bike balancing a stolen case of motor oil on the handlebars at 2am.
3666 2018-09-21 23:12:57 The oil companies like the carbon price because it will help natural gas put coal out of business. Oil companies are heavily invested in natural gas. Natural gas has half the carbon content of coal.
3667 2018-09-21 23:12:54 He's on his way to the service station where he'll fill up the oil & water, and check the gas.
3668 2018-09-21 23:11:58 This time i put it in the pan after the meat in the oil. But i mean theres nothing ricey about it. Its a bad texture & a cauliflower taste
3669 2018-09-21 23:11:57 I asked my mom to get me cbd oil for my migraines and this bitch got me cbd oil and hella edibles “just incase i need them”
3670 2018-09-21 23:11:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
3671 2018-09-21 23:11:45 Who has heard of CBD Oil?
3672 2018-09-21 23:11:25 Lmao all good! Yeah dude CB oil is great if your working and such. Then of course a good ol blunt with calm the nerves. Lol
3673 2018-09-21 23:11:01 2/2 knowledge of even the terminology let alone cellular biology to understand the science then of course cannabis oil salesmen convince many. How would u know either way. Pain relief / life style care NOT cancer cell proliferation  stick to medicine / treatment that works
3674 2018-09-21 23:10:53 Uses the jar of coconut oil as a visual thermometer of how warm it is in the house
3675 2018-09-21 23:10:49 It wasn’t the worst. I liked the music intro and you (3/4) are in DC. I used to live in Arlington and worked in DC. Will listen again. I’ve been a City fan since ‘99. I’m use to being let down, can’t wait for you to get that oil money tho

3685 2018-09-21 23:09:16 This cannabis oil / cures cancer rubbish must end . People spouting it don’t know that :
It’s cancerS not cancer . 200 cells 200 types. 
Cancer is DNA specific no 2 people’s cancers can be the same .the level of health your body is in is also a huge factor. If someone has 0 ..1/2
3686 2018-09-21 23:08:58 YES I thrive off of bread and olive oil!!!!! My Italian husband has me hooked lol. And ooooooh chocolate with hazelnuts sounds amazing!!!
3687 2018-09-21 23:08:51 I certainly hope she plans on wiping that body oil off of that beautiful paint with something. I see a couple of rags she can use. 
3688 2018-09-21 23:08:46 Cooked brussel sprouts with lemon pepper & olive oil are like candy!
3689 2018-09-21 23:08:06 This summer I had linguine with spot prawns with sauce that was perfect: fruity oil, a little bite of pepper, and edge of parsley fwiw, but it did seem like it promised winter comfort food
3690 2018-09-21 23:08:04 Den u good. But put teatree oil on it, it will kill the keloid. U need to be more careful on what hits against it
3691 2018-09-21 23:07:54 DuBois at Oil City is also in a weather delay. 
Looks like the stadium evacuation will last in Keystone until at least the tornado warning expires at 7:30 p.m.

3693 2018-09-21 23:07:50 Non-oil accounted for 63% while oil tax accounted for 38% in 2017. But 2018 is still in progress so maybe till it ends before we have a fairer comparison. Also, not forgetting the slight increase in oil prices for 2018.
3694 2018-09-21 23:07:36 tornado warning in oil city, pa and surounding ares
3695 2018-09-21 23:07:24 Have you tried soaking a cotton pad in an oil based eye makeup remover and letting it rest on your eyes for 30 seconds or so? Takes a bit longer but way more gentle x
3696 2018-09-21 23:07:08 This feels like one of those Twitter moms soliciting Twitter MAGA/Q chicks

"Date my large handsome son. He's got a job but no one wants to date him or live on the oil field with him"
3697 2018-09-21 23:06:31 Changed my oil it was fun
3698 2018-09-21 23:06:17 #Sudan voted No to #R2P, this while seeking an internationally approved military role in ceasefire monitoring in #SouthSudan, & preparing to move there physically to protect its oil interests; #Uganda tactfully went to the washroom, as did the object of their mutual attention,
3699 2018-09-21 23:06:07 Seems like a tall order when our country can't even agree to use our own oil instead if importing it from regimes with deplorable human rights
3700 2018-09-21 23:05:42 I wanted bread so I threw some almond flour, coconut flour, salt and eggs in a bowl lightly mixed it, fried it in coconut oil. Got my fix. Delicious! #lchf
3701 2018-09-21 23:05:37 He can wring out his scarf and sell the oil.
3702 2018-09-21 23:05:02 Older cars it’s easier doing maintenance in general lol. I just take mine in mine these days since my loca mechanic charges the same amount that I would spend on oil and a filter
3703 2018-09-21 23:04:59 Cause you would have whipped his bug eyed ass right then and there
3704 2018-09-21 23:04:58 THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS PUSHED FOR HIGHER TAXES BUT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP GET THE HUNDREDS OF PATENTED ITEMS THAT ARE ON FILE TO GIVE US 300MPG CARS, ELECTRIC VEHICLES W/ 800MILE RANGE, ENGINE'S THAT RUN ON WATER. DEAL WITH THIS NO MORE LAWS RE OIL. FREE UP WHATS HIDDEN.
3705 2018-09-21 23:04:55 My favorite is how all the essential oil people complain about how FDA compliance ruined everything.

3707 2018-09-21 23:04:49 Yea well they would want English inshore Oil & Gas stopped wouldnt they.income from the North sea and all that. Plus she fekng hates  Sassanacks.
3708 2018-09-21 23:04:47 Venezuela has brazenly taunted it's domination over the territory of Venezuela and it's oil reserves, which is a slap in the face to Washington, and Western Europe.  You are not alone in imposing sanctions.
The Trilateral Commision took over Amerikkka long ago.
3709 2018-09-21 23:04:34 And the second he terminates the deal, we can and hopefully will. No notice! He has a great oil deal, but is bitching about insignificant dairy trade? Bullying at its best only for his personal political gain.  @realDonaldTrump

3717 2018-09-21 23:02:46 Ever hear of a cannibas oil based product that you only use about 2mm size drop because it’s powerful strong. On the side it says viridesco it has pink kush and gorilla glue.thats the only hybrid I have right now. But I think it’s more indica than sativa.

3732 2018-09-21 23:00:22 I got three pounds of potatoes and I diced a couple of them up, tossed them in a frying pain with some oil, stirred them around a couple of times, and then put cheddar cheese and a fried egg on top with hot sauce. Good stuff.
3733 2018-09-21 23:00:22 It's that time of the year to start spraying every corner of the house and  behind all the furniture with peppermint oil mixed with water and a dot or 2 of dish soap!

3750 2018-09-21 22:57:54 Why NOC is importing petroleum products in different forms? Diesel,petrol,kerosene,bitumen,mobil all come from same crude oil. Better set up a refineries.
3751 2018-09-21 22:57:51 There are no pros for selling oil to Asia, unless your an oil company or the gov’t, hoping to catch some tax benefit. The rest is all cons, starting with the very good reasons mentioned by the Federal Appeals Court already.
3752 2018-09-21 22:57:48 My friend a pipelay project a drill rig a seismic operation all have direct and indirect benefits to the common man.oil and gas operations are picking up.people are going back to work and getting paid directly into their accounts.lolol

3755 2018-09-21 22:57:35 When I had mine, I loved it, but after about 10 yrs, it started burning a decent amount of oil and had to replace the head gasket. Otherwise a fine car. Had an Impreza WRX MT. Now driving a VW Golf TDI Wagen (6spd MT) and loving the efficiency.

He and his ilk are aligned with Saudi Arabia, the Bush/Cheneys
and the rest of the Oil Cartel thieves.
They are the people that blew up the Twin Towers.
Iran has never been our enemy.
3769 2018-09-21 22:55:32 Argan Oil is a great nighttime moisturizer. The Ordinary Sells theirs for less than 7$. And the CeraVe Hydrating cleanser is a great night time cleanser after you’ve removed your makeup
3770 2018-09-21 22:55:18 @HopeVidyas My friend runs her own salon, she said to put pure coconut oil in your beard, put a shower cap over your beard like one of those face masks (wrap around ears) then soak a towel in hot water, put it over the beard for 10 mins
3771 2018-09-21 22:55:18 Let's ban the dirtiest oil producers (Saudia Arabia et al.) and ween the world (USA, China, India, everyone) off of non-renewables using Canadian oil over the next 3 years. And then install a Tesla battery pack and solar panel on every residence and business. Let's go!!!
3772 2018-09-21 22:55:11 Are those trains really all coming to Vancouver? There’s no oil tankers heading out to sea and there’s only one refinery, thats already hooked up to the pipeline. There no other uses for bitumen here and the only jobs lost are temporary pipeline building jobs that barely started.
3773 2018-09-21 22:55:11 Venezuela crashed because it was a resource trap economy, not due to its socialist policies. They depended almost entirely on oil, and when those prices dropped, their economy fell to pieces.
3774 2018-09-21 22:54:51 “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemy, you anoint my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me ALL the days of my life. I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever”  Thank you Lord 
3775 2018-09-21 22:54:48 I love their split soy sauce packet with the chili oil and their xa xiu baos were my favorite. During high school we'd buy eggrolls from them to do fundraiser. Everyone at our school was always excited about them! Best eggroll sauce!

3777 2018-09-21 22:54:40 Now that penis has become crude oil... even small penis should get respect now!
3778 2018-09-21 22:54:11 The trick is getting salad dressings at restaurants, also mayo without veg oil or sugar.
3779 2018-09-21 22:53:46 And when it finally arrives... its not even oil!  It’s now burning radioactive effluent.

3787 2018-09-21 22:52:51 GOP tax bill opens up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. 

A state with oil money doesn’t need the three votes to count in a presidential election. They have oil, which is the same as votes. I wonder what the @DoyonLimited think of @lisamurkowski
3788 2018-09-21 22:52:24 It is not Alberta's oil. It is Canadas oil.
3789 2018-09-21 22:52:08 Oil change and the subs back 
3790 2018-09-21 22:51:36 Me too. The only essential oil that can be put directly on the skin. I use it a lot.
3791 2018-09-21 22:51:25 Without palm oil??
3792 2018-09-21 22:51:20 Yeah and when  Democrats regain control of Congress. You can kiss your oil drilling good bye!
3793 2018-09-21 22:51:15 ohh yeah I tried everything too and eventually gave up so I just always carry powder with me  guess you really can’t do much about the oil your body produces
3794 2018-09-21 22:51:12 youre a fake and a phony - a hypocrite - and snake oil sales man - Did you really make those statements about Stormy Daniels and Kavanaughs accuser??

3800 2018-09-21 22:50:48 The results with the oil were orders of magnitude better. I wasted a long trying to get good results with water because. It was easy to obtain and work with, but everything rusted and the time scales were pretty bad for my problem.
3801 2018-09-21 22:50:40 gonna go get some dab oil too, get excited
3802 2018-09-21 22:50:21 ジンギスカン食え
3803 2018-09-21 22:50:21 Is primer the only solution to keep oil at bay? What if you don’t wear any makeup on the daily? Do people JUST wear primer? I don’t want powder on my face either. Are people allowed to just wear primer? I read that helps faces stay matte so it should work right
3804 2018-09-21 22:50:19 Capicola, prosciutto, roasted red peppers, some random greens, a little mayo, and oil and vinegar on a seeded Italian bread. Done.

and value
3816 2018-09-21 22:48:09 Could be, in which case the end of Kalliroscope isn’t really an issue. There are plenty of alternatives for researchers who would have ordered Kalliroscope. Just looked it up and I used Kalliroscope in water, Flamenco Superpearl 120C+ in 10 cSt silicon oil.
3817 2018-09-21 22:47:56 Did you even use oil?
3818 2018-09-21 22:47:55 Can’t get enough of the smell of tea tree oil 
3819 2018-09-21 22:47:45 There were 300k march in NY against Iraq War, and 60% US opinion wanted military action if no dipl sol. US pop is 300+ million. Neither anti-war or pro-war sides were  ethical, given Bush's oil aims and Saddam's genocidal actions and aspirations. >
3820 2018-09-21 22:47:16 not a fan of purposefully misinformed propaganda that puts peoples lives in danger so some loser can sell snake oil pills to his delusional fans
3821 2018-09-21 22:47:15 Chef Kawasaki cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with cheese.

3825 2018-09-21 22:46:41 May the oil of the anointing be ignited by the fire of the Holy Spirit.
3826 2018-09-21 22:46:40 Like the DNC taking oil money, refusing to take evil oil money....then deciding they need oil money again.
3827 2018-09-21 22:46:35 I would highly suggest a potent anti oxidant and mineral to support overall health and recovery from workouts.  Fish oil is also helpful
3828 2018-09-21 22:46:19 Cbd oil is amazing. It’s non psychoactive and doesn’t get you high at all. It’s the only thing that helps with my anxiety.
3829 2018-09-21 22:45:56 Half the Oil, Gas & Money conference in Moscow I spoke at yesterday covered massive 'tax maneuvering' as they call the rebalancing of the fiscal regime between oil & products
3830 2018-09-21 22:45:55 You're not the only one, bro. Someone also recognize me quote " hey I know that guy, he's the one who creates Metro Sonic" while I took my car for an oil change at Firestone.

3838 2018-09-21 22:44:27 What was the weirdest food you were obsessed with as a kid? I liked eating spoonfuls of cold coconut oil 
3839 2018-09-21 22:44:21 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @steeletalk -- we are sending DISCOUNT oil from Alberta to Washington State - ( non world prices ) - who gets the billions of dollars in difference - you know the billions, the Media says we are loosing selling oil to the states
3840 2018-09-21 22:44:20 Idk when coconut oil became so popular but it truly doesnt even slap like that and is not even top 5 in the “oils I use bc i’m better than you” department
3841 2018-09-21 22:44:17 Thought about direction of crude oil ?
3842 2018-09-21 22:44:15 *Oxford with oil money.
3843 2018-09-21 22:43:44 Bullshit. This was leaked by the left. Is there anything the Democrats offer other than snake oil? 
3844 2018-09-21 22:43:39 $73 big ones for my trucks oil change 
3845 2018-09-21 22:43:32 The hashtag #TAE18 shaped my year. I loved to participate at the @twitrartexhibit in Australia and it created a new direction for my art. I paint now also on primed paper with oil and learned to paint on a very small postcard format and I met new talented artists. #HashtagDay
3846 2018-09-21 22:42:58 They don't want the answers but yet are demanding the FBI investigate the claims? Yeah, you keep peddling that snake oil, Don the Con.

3848 2018-09-21 22:42:57 1. Ooooooohhhh 

I’d like to think that my words are oil slick. Dark and swirling with fumes of purple and green.

But I think I probably speak in Orange. Bold, bright, and obnoxious.
3849 2018-09-21 22:42:51 Not really for most basic stuff. Some oil filters use different tools to remove them. Also invest in an obd 2.
3850 2018-09-21 22:42:39 if this is serious, glucosamine + chondroitin & fish oil is my combo. + chill stretching. But also have heard smoking works lol
3851 2018-09-21 22:42:33 Is Oil On Its Way To $80?
No necesariamente, porque todos suben producción: Russian oil producers rise to all-time high, Iraq oil exports breaking new records.
3852 2018-09-21 22:42:28 Ah good job all those dinosaurs died! Look at all the oil we’ve got! #Dinosaurjuice 
3853 2018-09-21 22:42:14 Since #Basrawis are not benefiting from the oil their land is producing, should oil production continue? I’ve been wondering about this for a while now. #Basra
3854 2018-09-21 22:42:06 Direction of crude oil post meeting in Algiers?
3855 2018-09-21 22:41:55 Bullshit! A 40 year claim is ridiculous. Sorry it’s not the 1950’s. Therapy and the real feminist movement came of age in the 70’s. Trying be drop dead gorgeous in the 70’s and 80’s and working for men in the oil industry. This claim proves your group doesn’t care about women.
3856 2018-09-21 22:41:37 Cream blush palette, prep and hydrate balm, Beauty Shield SPF 50 Primer, glitter primer, lip liner and blending brush, highlighting Pearl paint, tinted lip oil, lock on liner and brow cream and the liquid highlighter brush. It's a lot lol.

3861 2018-09-21 22:41:06 Don't forget the oil lamps for Grayling's bi-mode signals.
3862 2018-09-21 22:41:03 And I know how the Quebec pay their bills: with stolen money from hardworking Albertan's. And then they refuse a pipeline that will help AB and the whole country, rather than buy foreign oil, and dump raw sewage in the St Lawrence while talking about oil's impact on the enviro.
3863 2018-09-21 22:40:59 Dozens of synthetics, now off all of them for CBD oil.  So close to the 5-10mg of THC I need for nerve pain.  Waited 36 years for this for autism.  Amazing it's still a felony in my state when it's the only thing that's ever worked.  Lab rats for profit.  We are cattle to them.
3864 2018-09-21 22:40:53 First step in choking the EU. Cut the jugular an then oil starve them. It would only take one winter an the EU would be on its knees. An with all the extra migrants...
probably less than that.
3865 2018-09-21 22:40:45 Anybody knows somebody who does pull up oil changes?

3871 2018-09-21 22:40:00 I’m starting to get depressed I’m selling things so I can buy uniforms for my new job Tuesday and nobody has offered anything I mean 100 dollars or something so I can at least get a couple pair pants and shirts or maybe a oil change because it’s going to be a 30 min drive.
3872 2018-09-21 22:39:55 Took my lil putt putt to get her oil changed and now she happy and driving better than ever
3873 2018-09-21 22:39:52 Finally got around to ordering the Taemi Blends oil that @MiGoOk_SaRaM recommends. I can finally afford to purchase it. Yay! Can’t wait till it is here.

3883 2018-09-21 22:38:27 When I look at how Saudi Arabia and Qatar are using their oil money, it makes me wonder whether Nigeria are selling coconut oil. @alhajitekno @NNPCgroup @GistReel @TundeEdnut
3884 2018-09-21 22:38:21 I wonder how long I can go without my husband finding out I splurged on an essential oil diffuser. He just comments on how nice the house smells. 
3885 2018-09-21 22:38:13 That’s why our infrastructure needs to turn to port development on the East Coast & the West Coast. And ramp up infrastructure in the Hedbridean seas to take advantage of the next oil boom between the Scottish mainland, the Wedtern Isles & the Northern Isles. Take back control
3886 2018-09-21 22:38:05 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
3887 2018-09-21 22:37:38 I don't know the ingredients but I tried three different ones and they all make me sick to my stomach. At least my meds takes me from a 10 to about a 2 and a 2 on good days. One of the many things I have is fibromyalgia so the oil helped the stuff in my head but my stomach man!

3896 2018-09-21 22:36:17 The sandwiches, too.  You can mix your own oil and vinegar, add veggies, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and oregano...viola, better than any of the places around here.
3897 2018-09-21 22:36:15 Tell me how my gma gonna say she knows someone with cannabis oil and wants to get some like OKAY NANNY
3898 2018-09-21 22:35:48 I'm no fan of olives either except in its oil format (got it right that time). I assume that Olivia is the female version of Oliver though.
3899 2018-09-21 22:35:35 Sounds like a certain party is greasing the wheel for another "regime change" that also involves oil.

3904 2018-09-21 22:35:01 Both this water have different water densities(same way oil can't mix with water) so they can't mix
3905 2018-09-21 22:34:31 ポーランドに行ってどうぞ
3906 2018-09-21 22:34:30 Cda can't. They agreed to send something like 75% of our oil to the US with a discount in the last #NAFTA agreement.
3907 2018-09-21 22:34:29 Germany needed oil and living space. He underestimated USSR. Hitler said all we have to do is kick in the door and the whole rotten place will fall apart. not true as history shows.
3908 2018-09-21 22:34:27 Fresh pasta, homemade red sauce, really real parmesan, and quality olive oil. It's ok
3909 2018-09-21 22:34:18 Eat some fatty foods (butter, coco out oil, grass fed beef, wild salmon) it will slow down the absorption rate so you don’t spike and crash.
3910 2018-09-21 22:34:12 The rebates exist because of the high taxes Albertans pay, because of their high avg income because of their oil industry... do you get that, or is your head up where the sun doesn't shine?
3911 2018-09-21 22:33:35 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
3912 2018-09-21 22:33:34 Teachers are paid by the individual states and each state decides the salary. In Oklahoma, the politicians prefer to allow oil companies to pay almost 0 tax and make the people make up for it. Pay is low in Okla and the politicians are corrupt and embezzle the taxpayers money.
3913 2018-09-21 22:33:24 We never had a harassment case at the workplace. It might have to do with keeping abusers upside down at boiling oil.
3914 2018-09-21 22:33:17 Brother taking my car to get an oil change. Thaaankkkk you 
3915 2018-09-21 22:33:11 The oil from the Trans Mountain expansion is going to the US to make up for the declining Alaskan oil fields.
3916 2018-09-21 22:33:06 Yay higher gas prices let's stick it to oil companies so they can stick it to us twice as hard
3917 2018-09-21 22:32:46 Point taken .. your specialty is oil and all that stuff .. point I was making,the world was being told it would soon run out.. 120 a barrel... it was bollox@ ... there’s loads of it.

3923 2018-09-21 22:32:01 When we learned that all packaging materials used for cooking oil goes into the landfill, we found ourselves wanting to research and develop a product that makes a significant difference in waste reduction.

3927 2018-09-21 22:31:46 We live in a world of oil clubs and Barca/Real, we're screed either way. It's hardly a Tottenham-only problem tbf. We're a self sufficient club and we're absolutely fine. The fact we consistently finish above a lot of bigger spenders shows we're fine from that angle.
3928 2018-09-21 22:31:17 Why not have Oklahoma and the debt with a decent job, but then the oil field gives you unrealistic expectations when it tanks and were making almost 80K/year Laughing my ass off FUCK Oklahoma isn’t too bad, but we could be and should be better. In all. I agree w u
3929 2018-09-21 22:31:02 what are the ingredients in the oil you are taking?
3930 2018-09-21 22:30:52 Coconut oil is a major key.
3931 2018-09-21 22:30:32 Nope!

We shipped only 1.7M tonnes in all 2017 and only 1 ship to my knowledge this year, with protesters hanging from the 2nd Narrows Bridge trying to block the Serene Sea. Shipping oil to Asia has paid for no salaries, nor does it ever need to.

3934 2018-09-21 22:30:05 Christian Cole is approaching 200 rushing yards in the first quarter. The Oil City rushing record for one game is 325 yards set by Cole earlier this year against Franklin. @OilersFB
3935 2018-09-21 22:29:58 Wow. That's the worst I've seen as far as CBD oil laws go. Fuck sake here in indiana they finally legalized cbd across the board.

3985 2018-09-21 22:23:34 Well, a plain black tea bag that is damp enough to retain heat, but not dripping into your eye, placed against the oil/tear duct that is blocked will soothe the pain and loosen/pull out whatever is blocking your duct. I place a really warm pack over the bag to trap the heat in.
3986 2018-09-21 22:23:32 I definitely need an oil change
3987 2018-09-21 22:23:31 I've got lavender oil in my diffuser and had a sleeping pill with my beer. Sleepytime Spotify playlist is my next tactic.
3988 2018-09-21 22:23:31 Oil pulling is definitely the weirdest thing ive ever done
3989 2018-09-21 22:23:03 Tezporah Berman is no crusading angel. She's just another shill furthering the cause of the big money American Foundations whose goal is to obstruct and stop the production and marketing of the Alberta Oil Industry.
3990 2018-09-21 22:22:58 Anyone who has gone through chemo or knows someone who has... what are some gift items you found were helpful/useful? I'm putting together a care pack for my mom. So far I have slippers, candied ginger, sea-band anti nausea, unscented moisturizer/lip balm, coconut oil?
3991 2018-09-21 22:22:55 #tytlive I wonder if @CNN would have the same take on the issue of #HealthForAll if their profits weren't generated by the corporate health care industry and snake oil salesmen.
3992 2018-09-21 22:22:50 Sorry I couldn't finish my blog entry. My bottle of oil broke.
3993 2018-09-21 22:22:41 We have governors now who don't think about wealth creation, all they do is to run to abuja at the end of the month to share oil money! Tufiakwa!
3994 2018-09-21 22:22:24 #ChineseLoan

So Southern Oil was what @MBuhari used as collateral for the loan he took from the Chinese?

Knowing he's gone, if Nigeria can't pay back they'll seize the states and her oil...

Southerners, we warned you against this demon, una no hear.
3995 2018-09-21 22:22:15 このダイスくんに小銭入れたい
3996 2018-09-21 22:21:38 I hope the problem wasn't connecting the ship to shore power.  A crew that can't do that quickly and flawlessly would be fried in some extra hot oil.
3997 2018-09-21 22:21:36 あーーーー！！！！やばいですわよこれは、たいへん、エッチ
3998 2018-09-21 22:21:20 If you deep fried tater tots in oil then they would almost certainly be mini hashbrown patties. And I would almost certainly order them.
3999 2018-09-21 22:21:12 It might be because of some light oil buildup on the bronzer from your brush that’s trapping it! When that happens I just wipe or lightly scrape off the top layer and usually it works better after that!
4000 2018-09-21 22:21:02 Especially since our states main incomes are the oil field, the seafood industry, and tourism/movie stuff.
4001 2018-09-21 22:20:55 Sadly, Malaysia developed rapidly courtesy of our oil palm. Just negodu 
4002 2018-09-21 22:20:35 What do u work in the oil field
4003 2018-09-21 22:20:31 @jessicalexicus ok , i think i just acted in an adult manner , now it is time for an adult response 

an oil drilling i will go , an oil drilling i will go hi ho your derriere a oil drilling i will go
4004 2018-09-21 22:20:29 that happened to me today, i just took the oil out and poured it into a different cart

4008 2018-09-21 22:20:16 Trump and Pence just want their oil.
4009 2018-09-21 22:20:10 Despite all the provocation,  Iran has never invaded the west, unlike the west who unvaded Iran in 1941 in an attempt to control oil supplies. Its all about the wests need to control oil folks, just like Syria.
4010 2018-09-21 22:19:53 This is the shoe I wear every day at work...  For my airshow flying I use the Fire Resistant Merlins by LIFT Aviation.  They are comfortable, super grippy on my sometimes smoke oil soaked wing, and the heel slider gives you a much better focused connection on the rudder pedals.
4011 2018-09-21 22:19:44 I would argue that it is, because without that, the entire market picture for oil globally changes.
4012 2018-09-21 22:19:36 I pity me with the amount of oil I've consumed these past few days
4013 2018-09-21 22:19:20 Penny love your dream to come true, no more unionist elite in Westminster dictating to Scotland we are a nation. You are living off of our oil, whisky and gas, agriculture/fishing and electricity could soon be water. So nothing against the English but your pound will be devalued

4022 2018-09-21 22:18:07 My life has been significantly improved by diffusing peppermint oil

4026 2018-09-21 22:17:54 For 7 years we have done everything we can think of, but as long as the tories are in power they serve big oil and gas. No other political party agrees to fracking. We have been infiltrated with undercover cops from day one, we have been misled by industry shills and misdirected.
4027 2018-09-21 22:17:54 After a blocked punt, Oil City makes it 14-0 on a Holden Stahl keeper. Christian Cole on the 2-pointer. 14-0 Oilers in the first against DuBois.
4028 2018-09-21 22:17:52 And transport our oil haha.
4029 2018-09-21 22:17:43 Other countries without oil like Malaysia have long left us behind!
4030 2018-09-21 22:17:38 おはようございます、ねむい
4031 2018-09-21 22:17:35 Are you serious? @OntarioPCParty @fordnation  and @CPC_HQ are simply the “government relations” arm of the oil & gas industry.
4032 2018-09-21 22:17:22 How could anyone forget???
That was right after Lord Zarkon from Onstavius III revealed his presence to us and *just before Cthulu woke up and started eating oil tankers.
No *way* to forget that.
4033 2018-09-21 22:17:18 Draining that swamp and filling it with oil & gas. Sounds about right. 
4034 2018-09-21 22:17:17 What kind of oil he be using?! I’m trying to get my glow on just like that!
4035 2018-09-21 22:17:13 oeiiiii dats echt pijnlijk! Try tea tree oil!

4037 2018-09-21 22:17:05 Pretty solid cars. I put 180k on a ‘98 outback in Colorado before I sold it. Had to rebuild oil pump once and replace alternator (under warranty) but other than that nothing but pm. Great in snow.
4038 2018-09-21 22:16:58 Oil.
4039 2018-09-21 22:16:50 I didn’t have any lotion so I put baby oil on my face and damn my skin sucked that up.

4054 2018-09-21 22:15:55 I scheduled a reiki healing session, float tank session, and facial for next week. This is the equivalent of applying coconut oil to my entire life.
4055 2018-09-21 22:15:48 WHY DOES NOBODY HAVE LIP OIL PLEASE MY LIPS ARE SO DRY
4056 2018-09-21 22:15:37 Give me the oil then
4057 2018-09-21 22:15:32 Hence the term "idiot oil".
4058 2018-09-21 22:15:22 Women nowadays be out here mowing lawns and changing their own oil. Bro, when they say they don’t need you THEY DONT NEED YOU.
4059 2018-09-21 22:15:18 Other than smelling like metal and oil, his cologne still managed to stick throughout all of this. Sitting on the couch, Tony waited until Steve came around and flipped shirt right off. Getting oil on the couch was bad. He remembers what happened last time...
4060 2018-09-21 22:15:16 Update on my oil change situation. I’m currently getting an oil change, thank you Twitter :)
4061 2018-09-21 22:15:09 And special gadgets to clean up oil spills because of course we all know what will happen. The steady move to destroying everything and everyone that is fine in our world. Get your Trudeau Sox while you can
4062 2018-09-21 22:15:08 It is less attractive because it is further to get to Asia and I don't know about refining capacity in Europe. Then the port is not open all year. Yet! But it might be a partial alternative for the oil nuts.

4066 2018-09-21 22:14:33 Those working toward freedom always have a deep mistrust of the state. People make compromises, and judgments tas fit the particular contexts they inhabit. But what we've had this week hasn't been that, it's been cheap oil as human right, it's not been contingent or complicated.
4067 2018-09-21 22:14:14 What’s amazing to me is your party wants to implement a job killing, business stifling carbon tax, your federal counterparts want to eliminate oil and gas completely, but yet you cry foul to a transaction of an asset in the gas industry that MAY result in job losses??
4068 2018-09-21 22:13:49 Damn, that will buy a lot of $75 haircuts and beard oil.
4069 2018-09-21 22:13:42 You might find oil!
4070 2018-09-21 22:13:41 Somebody tell Zinke that people other than oil executives can read Twitter.

4072 2018-09-21 22:13:29 A Jungle Gym called Edging Forest where you practice cuddle techniques while massaging beards with coconut oil
4073 2018-09-21 22:13:18 Oh, is it?? Cuz it was Obama who decided to withdraw troops despite knowing how unstable Iraq was. Then ISIS was propped up & in the name of targeting ISIS, USA targeted Asad's & Russians. All for oil to Europe & thus loss to Russia as they are the chief oil suppliers of Europe.
4074 2018-09-21 22:13:08 Bout to stop being lazy and change my own oil after this lmao.
4075 2018-09-21 22:13:04 Hahaha I assumed it was a typo. But truly I get my coconut oil there always and it’s cheaper than everywhere else, organic and smells sooooo fhdjrjhrj gooooood

4077 2018-09-21 22:12:35 The oil will not end, God willing.
4078 2018-09-21 22:12:33 Dont do it. Owned a '15 which burned an unreasonable amount of oil. Otherwise a decent car but the oil thing is a deal breaker for me. Traded it for a highlander and have never looked back.
4079 2018-09-21 22:12:17 I agree Dee, there has to be a turning point. Many of us wish it was decades ago! I was trying to reflect some understanding for those in bed with the oil industry. There is no easy time to make major transition.
4080 2018-09-21 22:12:10 And do you think the US or UN cares about ‘PEACE’ ? No, the US only cares about venezuela because they have oil!  You don’t see them talk about peace in Congo for exemple!

4089 2018-09-21 22:10:57 Humiliating. $100 million builds one high school in my local government here in the US. The local government spends 50% of its $6 billion annual budget on K-12 public education. If Nigeria had spent her oil money well, she wouldn’t be forced to accept pennies from the other.
4090 2018-09-21 22:10:41 You know that many people in the US want to stop the war machine. No more destruction of people or culture. Humans have more value than oil. We know what you do and do not approve
4091 2018-09-21 22:10:19 Wow you guys are idiots. To trade clean drinking water for fracked gas and oil is not a good thing. We should be number 1 in solar and wind that’s where the future is. Even China has realized this. Oil profits over People its the GOP way.

4110 2018-09-21 22:09:14 Google it, Bill Clinton laid the foundations for USA's invasion of Iraq. He was the 1 who signed Iraq liberation act in 1998 against Saddam. Bush had to fight Clinton's wars. Your arms lobby destabilizes countries & makes money by supplying weapons to both sides, oil is byproduct
4111 2018-09-21 22:09:14 rahm emanuel is right? can't expect trump to learn from disastrous history of u.s. interference in countries to the south & there was that sneak meeting w/ insurgents WH tried to spin.  but then maduro goes to china & sells them oil so maybe venezuela not easy pickings for trump

4128 2018-09-21 22:07:23 The American Arms industry are the terrorists in that area. That military aid will find its way back to Us Arms companies .

4129 2018-09-21 22:06:53 So what’s the fight for independence for if that’s the case? Why do you have representation in London? You must be giving you oil tax take to the UK central coffers because you’re amazingly generous neighbors. Devolved power is not sovereignty.
4130 2018-09-21 22:06:29 Are you looking for an oil pourer that works without drips? The OXO oil pourer does it all! Refill your oil easily with the easy open flap on top. Then close the flap and your done! It’s that easy. No drips, no waste.

4134 2018-09-21 22:06:11 Rest it permanently. UK would sink without oil and whisky. Check your facts!
4135 2018-09-21 22:05:58 There is not a product that is made that does not have oil, gas or coal somewhere in its manufacturing process. Do we need to stop burning oil, yes. Do we need oil, gas and coal to survive yes we do.
4136 2018-09-21 22:05:56 Why? Mountain Dew and Doritos give him strength. He's really getting at something here. He could be the next Alex Jones! Burn that midnight oil, Erick! It's all a set-up, Democrats are behind it, Ed's a good guy, Brett likes baseball!
4137 2018-09-21 22:05:56 Lori, it was provided by an oil company ROV working in the north central Gulf of Mexico. We were not able to get a precise location though the date, time, and depth in feet, are on the video overlay. It's part of the Gulf SERPENT project.
4138 2018-09-21 22:05:42 does it come with an oil leak?
4139 2018-09-21 22:05:19 I used the leftover olive oil and seasoning that was in the pan and squeezed the lemon into it to cook the asparagus. It no longer takes like rocks.
4140 2018-09-21 22:05:17 So are you going to stop driving a vehicle or using anything that is made from oil, like your smartphone?  Didn’t think so, hypocrite.
4141 2018-09-21 22:05:13 Use dirty oil
4142 2018-09-21 22:05:09 But oil rising.
4143 2018-09-21 22:05:05 They have money to travel in winter now from oil. That would help the endless night.
4144 2018-09-21 22:05:02 No. They found their own way here -  they can find their own way back, when they can no longer get jobs here

4161 2018-09-21 22:01:56 Why are people at @McDonalds  so stingy with the sauce? You would think they wrre guarding oil reserves.
4162 2018-09-21 22:01:50 What about the impact of trains delivering all the oil?  What about the massive loss of jobs and investment in Canada?  What about the lack revenues for transfer payment because our oil sold at a massive discount? Shut up you wack.

4168 2018-09-21 22:01:18 Perhaps possible that Oil & Gas companies will fully recognize the threat of EVs to their business model and build out HFC infrastructure, something they've should've done 20 years ago. But yes, I think EVs have won. Big money pouring in from automakers and electric utilities.

4184 2018-09-21 22:00:08 Kickoff approaching at the Oil Field in Oil City. No rain yet, but high winds and dark sky approaching.
4185 2018-09-21 22:00:00 Coconut oil
4186 2018-09-21 21:59:54 Basic logic, oil is a limited resource, it doesn't magically appear. When Saudi Arabia runs out of oil (likely in the next few decades) your economy will diminish.
4187 2018-09-21 21:59:46 Guess he doesn't have to worry about that oil change.
4188 2018-09-21 21:59:32 Oil oil oil. Look like you have oil instead brain. usa became 3rd largest oil producer and begin export of oil. So no not everything is about oil in this world. And yes Usa dont have idea how to jandl Middle East

4194 2018-09-21 21:58:58 The Keystone Pipline is going to just send oil through the United States, not to it.
Fast and Furious began under George Bush.
Obamacare "was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress."
4195 2018-09-21 21:58:58 Wow! A, Washington, D.C. sandwich/hoagie chain named Taylor Gourmet is closing up shop in all it’s stores after the owner of Taylor Gourmet met with Trump, and then sales started plummeting. Lesson learned, you meet with a snake oil salesmen, expect to be poisoned.
4196 2018-09-21 21:58:56 I wish. Misery loves company, especially company that has oil, and young people to conscript into its next war.
4197 2018-09-21 21:58:55 I purchased my $IGC stock for .61 cent each.. they all now are worth 2.90 a piece .... and even better news their #hyalolex oil helps slow down damage from Alzheimer’s..... amazing the power of cannabis

4204 2018-09-21 21:58:11 Just looked at your bio, you're obviously joking as if you're working in the oil industry you know Norway doesn't need subsidising.
4205 2018-09-21 21:58:09 Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I never even think  of using my phone while driving.  Of course it could because I drive a classic car and I am constantly watching the oil pressure gauge in case of engine blow up.  And I have no airbags so drive in a constant state of terror.
4206 2018-09-21 21:58:01 Sometimes I think I don't have any daddy issues at all, but then I get all heart-eyes when my BF does things like remind me it's time for an oil change so idk

4208 2018-09-21 21:57:51 Quacks = Peter Schiff!   :)

"There were predictions that the Dow would become equal in price to an ounce of gold, implying something like stocks falling 90% or gold increasing 10-fold.

Or that oil would reach $300 dollars a barrel.

There are always, and will always be, quacks"
4209 2018-09-21 21:57:46 Oh, yeah, I was more interested in convenience than a bargain, so didn’t really care about the price. It was just really weird preemptive behavior from a customer service perspective. Maybe people scream at him when they find out what he charges for a synthetic oil change.
4210 2018-09-21 21:57:38 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
4211 2018-09-21 21:57:26 Buying oil at Walmart, they asked if I wanted to donate to "relief". What relief? Nothing happened u fuken grifters.

4229 2018-09-21 21:55:06 The coal boom in Germany is a result of the oil crisis in the 70ies. Coal power now mostly exported.
4230 2018-09-21 21:55:01 @LaOilGasAssoc Have done a lot of research and confirmed the high rate of how Africans consume gas for their domestic use, my research location is from Nigeria and Ghana and as we know, Nigeria is an oil producing country, while gas uses oil and gas as a means of country revenue.
4231 2018-09-21 21:54:59 Alta real GDP growth 2.7% and oil prices are rising.  Sask GDP 2.1% and unemployment down to 6.5%. Not too shabby.

4238 2018-09-21 21:54:10 And here I thought self-flagellation was something from medieval times or in obscure insane religious cults.
Oh wait...this IS starting to sound like the Church of Identity Politics & submissive self-loathing cultists schooled in obedient homage to the progressive gods.  
4239 2018-09-21 21:54:08 I really hope you post the rest of the series. Not only did you two work hard to create this, but as consumers we need to know the truth. I’m tired of buying snake oil because some “guru” told me I can’t live without it.
4240 2018-09-21 21:53:54 mmmmmmmm love lavender oil. 
4241 2018-09-21 21:53:50 Maybe for your pockets...he has completely disregarded SE New Mexico communities favoring more radioactive dumps and deregulation for the oil industry polluting the area.
4242 2018-09-21 21:53:42 If only oil can fall to $35 by Nov 2018...

4248 2018-09-21 21:52:46 I believe Russians have long thought Oil is a mineral, and I think their right.
4249 2018-09-21 21:52:34 But US is now biggest oil exporter !!!
4250 2018-09-21 21:52:27 I’m a Landman for a natural gas company in West Virginia. One of my duties as a landman is to find people and negotiate oil&gas leases with them. Today I went to Sistersville, WV to meet with an 86 year old man named Bennie.

There's a lot that goes on under the carpet with modi baba chalis chor.. petroleum which is national resource and assam where oil refining was banned due to environmental concerns, the day modi govt got into assam they sold off oil fields 2 foreign companies.

4261 2018-09-21 21:51:08 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil or baby oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade. We also advise that you always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down.
4262 2018-09-21 21:51:08 It occurs to me that as long as there are unrepentant sinners burning in perdition, we should have an inexhaustible supply of crude oil. In fact it could be argued that if we completely abandoned using it, the supply would accumulate & at some point saturate the whole Earth.
4263 2018-09-21 21:50:58 @AllenLone  You still cant get v.moo off the ground, your a complete train wreck. So many times you said Montana in play at $50, $60 us oil. Now we have $70 and soon to be $80. Completely unqualified for your job, and way under skilled. #oil #worstceoever #stocks #Montana

4270 2018-09-21 21:49:48 @neiltyson (no Center in the universe) it's like when you have a small bowl of water with flaked pepper in it and dropped one drop of oil in the center everything disperses from the center including the oil itself.
4271 2018-09-21 21:49:40 That's why these feckless Republicans need to just vote and let the Democrats whine. It's all manufactured crisis for the baby killers, aka democrat voters. Ever heard of the squeaky wheel gets the oil? It's failing, best to replace. The crying Republicans need replacing.
4272 2018-09-21 21:49:21 oil nut? Don't you mean cuprous rocambole blackheart?

4275 2018-09-21 21:49:00 Sure they have a car culture....cars run on oil still. But difference is that the transit company and contractors have work ethic. They understand that they are in a City ultimately dependent on oil...and need to use that product properly and reliably......
4276 2018-09-21 21:48:58 if oil is sold in the global market that is not saying in the US

4278 2018-09-21 21:48:48 So why do we have to buy oil from OPEC?
4279 2018-09-21 21:48:48 And oil leaks
4280 2018-09-21 21:48:47 Reminds me of the neighborhood ruined by exide. Even Bev Hills is eventually getting rid of their oil rig on the high school campus. Oil company there filed bankruptcy so maybe it will never happen. Least the drilling's stopped.
4281 2018-09-21 21:48:35 I have a pain in my face all day but what makes me happy is my mam bought me lavender oil while she was away and it’s the only thing that works 
4282 2018-09-21 21:48:34 I've got a mould problem. It gives me asthma. I like nothing more than being a thorn in the side of the civil service. While I irritate them I put Clove oil & our Tea tree oil in an oil burner & it clears my head & my lungs!

4289 2018-09-21 21:47:52 They didnt change the channel?
4290 2018-09-21 21:47:49 I would have done, but I failed to acquire filters in time. A major priority when I'm back. The oil looks grim.

4294 2018-09-21 21:47:29 I want to do my oil show tonight but chaturbate is being very unreliable. Everytime I go on the system is down.
4295 2018-09-21 21:47:17 CBD oil is a life saver, wouldn’t be able to function without it.
4296 2018-09-21 21:47:16 Great!!! So you’ll be siding with us @steelworkers if we strike agains US Steel for giving us crooked and unfair contract proposals? Great! Thanks, don’t let us down!!! Don’t forget, we make pipes for oil lines.
4297 2018-09-21 21:47:08 If they loved their people they would stand together and fight for this nation not for the oil and money ! Its not a fight over identity, it is a fight over flags and over the oil !!! The treasons came from both not only from puk !
4298 2018-09-21 21:47:04 Q: do you get really baked from high THC oil? If so, it may just b that the higher concentrations of CBD are actually aiding the uptick of the little amount of THC in the oil & because it's getting processed by your liver, you feel it more due to it being stronger after ingestion
4299 2018-09-21 21:47:02 Had a 14th place finish last night at the beautiful Lucas Oil Speedway. Back at it tonight for night 2.
4300 2018-09-21 21:47:01 What do your think about avocado oil? It can take high heat.
4301 2018-09-21 21:47:01 their 'big industry' IS oil. Transit industry purchases it in bulk from companies and keeps 'economy moving' ,,,,doesn't waste it by idling on road with people already boarded.
4302 2018-09-21 21:46:49 I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that  wouldn't screw to save its species. I wanted to open the dump valves on  oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I'd never see. I wanted  to breathe smoke.
4303 2018-09-21 21:46:33 Do you do oil or acrylic?
4304 2018-09-21 21:46:32 Trans Mountain because AB must sell/refine elsewhere. AB and Canadian economy depends on the sale of Alberta oil. USA still wants AB oil cheaper than Brent but NAFTA for the Canadian argument is weaker because of US fracking and the saturated market. That's why Trump can threaten
4305 2018-09-21 21:46:30 As of this year America is the number one producer of oil on the planet.  So,....why are gas prices still so high?

4314 2018-09-21 21:45:52 Got my oil analysis back for the 305. Pretty much double confirms the things I saw last night. Potassium numbers were odd, and Blackstone recommended me to keep an eye on that.
4315 2018-09-21 21:45:48 "Your" sick tirades. So, what you said is "I'm incapable of critical thinking and the site that pulls up six week old news stories and treats them as new reinforces my confirmation bias also my timeline is a cesspool of snake oil and hate"

4321 2018-09-21 21:45:12 I don't think all foreign policy is bad, but the Saudi relationship is strictly about oil $ masquerading as national security.

And the bombing of Yemen is unconscionable.
4322 2018-09-21 21:45:10 Exactly. I know in my business oil/gas the women can be cruder than the men.
4323 2018-09-21 21:45:06 Because they have what the UK could have had. Plenty oil still out there and currently $79 dollars a barrel. Who is subsidising who?
4324 2018-09-21 21:45:00 Some mornings, it's nice have your car crash tested, and then get to the Seoul of UK's oil reserves.

4326 2018-09-21 21:44:56 Beard oil or balm can help 
4327 2018-09-21 21:44:46 Nothing.  I had no issues, but the traction light came on.  I needed an oil change anyway and new tires.  So I asked the service writer to check out the traction light, change the oil and tires.  I got a call that my car needed $6700 worth of repairs, incl. brakes & transmission.
4328 2018-09-21 21:44:35 All times day and night FFS and north of Dundee on average speed they have to make up the loss in oil and gas somewhere.  
4329 2018-09-21 21:44:33 ...for what? Yeah, that's really bad on the oil change interval, but unless something is literally broken, all it needs is an air filter, another oil change, and maybe a tire rotation. Total of about $100 at a Valvoline.

Please change your oil at least every 10k!
4330 2018-09-21 21:44:33 Clary Sage essential oil works wonders. Apply it directly to the skin with a carrier oil or mix it in your bath. Helps with other period symptoms too and it’s super relaxing.
4331 2018-09-21 21:44:28 Wow. My students and I watched the Exxon Valdez Oil Spil documentary in class the past two days because they need to be able to identify the effects of oil spills on the marine environment...
4332 2018-09-21 21:44:09 Seriously been the worst day+ now at Toyota for more than an hour to change a tail light & oil. Now... it’s not the light though im sure it’ll still cost me, now they need to do a deeper diagnostic to check if it’s a wiring issue. Why the hell did I decide to go to a dealership.

4382 2018-09-21 21:38:17 Entire energy complex of North America, not just Canada, is over burdened and lacking scale to production capability. It is the infrastructure equivalent of the lack of future investment in global oil exploration. This is all due to politics and recent low return on investment

4394 2018-09-21 21:36:25 You so naive. Israel won almost every war with arab country so if we wanted oil we would get it. In real world ppl is what matter not oil. Israel didn't had any resources but still developed hight tech economy while most arab countries just pumped oil. You dont learn your lesson
4395 2018-09-21 21:36:20 Okay, I’m slightly more savvy (on oil changes and really cheap and always have @jiffylube coupons) but if it was now or never... I do cars the same way.

4406 2018-09-21 21:35:10 Just found a spot that sell all natural moringa oil from Haiti.
4407 2018-09-21 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this September? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
4408 2018-09-21 21:35:03 And Trump is urging an increase in foreign oil production before the election, so the price will go down some, but just wait until after the election, when the price will go way up (high prices help his friends, the ones that got him elected)
4409 2018-09-21 21:34:53 They told us oil comes from dead dinosaurs and plants yet we find it 6 miles below the earth. Impossible historically speaking. The tectonic plates lubricate themselves. This is why oil fields refill themselves "miraculously."

4429 2018-09-21 21:31:14 That is what a large portion of children elsewhere are taught that we do anyway.  A foreign exchange student in our home said they have always been told we take over areas for oil.  Another visa holder whose father owns a nearby convenience store believes we started WWI & WWII.
4430 2018-09-21 21:31:03 Umm, you forget why ZEVs really exist in the first place. 

The real reason was to take pressure off the efforts to remove all the oil subsidies that exist to this day. 

That was the bargain, ZEVs in exchange for no lawsuits.

But yeah, Donny likes courtrooms.

4441 2018-09-21 21:29:45 The United States are now the largest oil producing country  why not end tariffs which help farmers more than anything. Sad what your trying to get South Dakotans to believe 
4442 2018-09-21 21:29:45 it's exactly the sort of thing we cook, although I've never cooked with algea oil!
4443 2018-09-21 21:29:23 Oh I was hoping you could just give me the eye shadow make and the luxe tan oil details as it said 15 but can’t find where to buy at that price - thank you for your help

4455 2018-09-21 21:27:44 People who smoke we’d have you used CBD oil and does it to anything? Which do you prefer for physical pain vs mental health? 

I’ve already spoken to some people about this but I’m wondering if there’s a pattern
4456 2018-09-21 21:27:42 If gold can't leave China it makes gold backing for the Yuan as irrelevant as Venezuelan oil backing for the Petro. My guess is this flow is related to China gold swap financing bypassing domestic credit restrictions.
4457 2018-09-21 21:27:32 Marine impacts from shipping product through our waters were previously excluded from consideration, but they should be evaluated. If we can expand oil sands operations and meet our GHG emission goals with the pipeline, then this should be presented (it has not).
4458 2018-09-21 21:27:21 That could be true but peanut oil is actually used in a lot of restaurants and amusement parks.

4463 2018-09-21 21:26:51 It was new for me to work with oil pastels. Loved it! The kids loved it too
4464 2018-09-21 21:26:47 It's definitely a subsidy.  Ask the oil industry if they would be willing to take on that $81B themselves to ensure the continued smooth running of their market.
4465 2018-09-21 21:26:42 Nah...SNP could have wrecked Scotland with the north sea oil crap then oil crashed to $25 a barrel....i rest my case..

4490 2018-09-21 21:23:26 That’s what I feel sorry for! She’s probably gonna get hate from the olicity parasites as soon as she shares a scene with olive oil

4493 2018-09-21 21:23:04 See, there's your problem, you actually think the only alternative to 'mud huts' is oil & plastics. Yes, the lack of education is apparent in that & of history. Industry is always in a state of evolution. The world banks & even oil cos are divesting from this industry. "Evolve".
4494 2018-09-21 21:23:04 And may be you have he's d horror stories but stop to think of they are the whole story. Someone who is here now is telling that's not what she sees. As for imbalance a lot of what Jamaica bought from TT is oil. Which we need.
4495 2018-09-21 21:23:03 Told my mom i was bouta go get an oil change and said why 
4496 2018-09-21 21:22:58 Why is it so hard to navigate your car when the oil change people are asking you to do simple tasks such as the blinker and brights
4497 2018-09-21 21:22:54 it is a subsidy of oil, and it should be a justification for re-allocating public money into renewables, but we would always have to have enough military presence in the Middle East to prevent conquest of the  large oil fields by our great power adversaries.

4511 2018-09-21 21:20:58 This sounds counter intuitive.

Saudia Arabia is oil dry. Their business was gun running until Trump took office.

Environmental science has come a long way since OIL! 

Venezuela is imploding with oil...seek their environment!
4512 2018-09-21 21:20:55 Well, with the wheel bearing done and the usual pre-flight checks, I foresee a successful trip! With favourable MPG, too!! I always do an oil and filter change before any epic journeys, even if it isn't due yet, but that's just me. Bit of an obsession, I'm afraid...
4513 2018-09-21 21:20:52 Bush family just wants to control the world's oil supply. George H W Bush is still calling the shots for the Republican party. Now, Brett Kavanaugh a Bush loyalist is nominated for Supreme Court. Can't trust any of them. Period. Trump should know better. Traitors all around!

4517 2018-09-21 21:20:43 Amanita Cesare. Bought a few, very tasty. Typically eaten raw with driz axle of olive oil and seasoning, carpaccio stle.
4518 2018-09-21 21:20:35 These are one of the reasons for our brain drain.  If we take the bar another step lower than this, I’m sure we will hit crude oil.

4522 2018-09-21 21:19:48 Yup. Just leaves the worrying oil leak now. (that I tried to find earlier and failed. I changed the sidelight bulbs instead).
4523 2018-09-21 21:19:45 Oil and gas companies have bent over backwards to appease left wing loons. They will never be happy. You nitrods don't have a clue. Oil and gas independence is a serious method of providing global security. You roids can't hug trees if you are running for your lives...
4524 2018-09-21 21:19:44 final shift at the pub done, till christmas anyway! At least i won't constantly smell of salad and chip oil for a while tho
4525 2018-09-21 21:19:26 Definitely a subsidy for big oil, but it’s also a subsidy for Americans who enjoy $3.00-3.50/gal gas. I say we cut it off and watch cars on our roads go from big SUVs/trucks to Leaf’s/Prius’ almost overnight.

4537 2018-09-21 21:18:14 I am not saying that, no. Rail transport can be pretty awful when it goes wrong too!  What I do think should be discussed is how our gov's still subsidze oil and gas heavily.  It has to happen now, the switch.  not just claim to be environmental, doing the same stuff
4538 2018-09-21 21:18:07 Weld it, grind/shape it, heat it, dip it in oil to harden it and put it together. Since it’s not useable as is, what have you got to loose? Some of us have had to fix or repair parts just to get back on the road
4539 2018-09-21 21:17:59 There's a difference between thinking that investing in alternative energy sources is the future and calling for a complete ban of oil products. Your tweet is completely irrelevant and only shows how narrow your view is.

4552 2018-09-21 21:16:19 Truth is you protect the countries because they have oil.
4553 2018-09-21 21:16:12 How about the billion dollar supplement/diet industry like Herbalife et all that sell snake oil to the masses with zero large scale proof they work. At least dieticians promote real food, real cooking and exercise to be healthy regardless of shape and size. #shoutouttodieticians

4563 2018-09-21 21:15:46 I don’t know who needs to hear this, but when using an indefinite article before a noun that begins in a vowel, you use AN not A. Vice versa, when using an indefinite article before a noun with a consonant, you use A. 
Ex: A Dog. 
AN Oil change.
4564 2018-09-21 21:15:32 Got home and gisted my mum about the stories of missing penises in lagos, Guess who's having anointing oil in their bathing water tomorrow ?

4573 2018-09-21 21:14:55 Norway (1) Lots of oil wealth invested in national fund (2) Their leaders have always said, "Don't copy us, we're having to muddle through with a second-rate deal with the EU because we've twice failed to persuade Norwegians to support EU membership".  Works 'cos they're rich.

Its good to be proud of your country
But you will be worse off as Scotland just can’t survive without England
It hasn’t got the industry besides empty gas and oil fields some of which are ours
4589 2018-09-21 21:12:56 The rising price of oil is what will cause the real price increases.

4618 2018-09-21 21:09:53 What are the marine safety implications of not building the pipeline? Will our freshwater and marine environments be safer? What difference do you foresee in global GHG emissions if we use foreign oil instead of Canadian since the pipeline doesn't address demand?
4619 2018-09-21 21:09:38 Lets see, North Korea is seriously talking to South Korea about peace. Unemployment is at record lows. Stock market record high. Refugees and illegals at low levels.

4628 2018-09-21 21:08:58 @realdonaldtrump should be impeached. Every move he makes puts Americans at risk by working to support the oil and gas industry, risking the environment and our health.
4629 2018-09-21 21:08:58 Probably because most of em don’t know a time before the oil money rolled into town. That’s why your stadiums empty on a School night.

4645 2018-09-21 21:06:56 Oh ta. It’s all about the low surface area to volume ratio. 

And really hot oil.
4646 2018-09-21 21:06:48 I could totally see that with oil paints, new ones have a particular smell about them!
4647 2018-09-21 21:06:46 Sigh.
Apples, oranges, wrong ...
1. Oil/wind aren't same.
2. Issue offshore drilling, among other things, pollution risks to beach/ocean area.
3. Offshore wind has far more potential (and less expensive than new) tidal power.

4657 2018-09-21 21:05:15 That said, the Venezuelan gov should have made themselves more independent, Chavez, while he did some good reforms, rode an oil boom instead of prioritizing diversification and most importantly real socialist reform(aka giving the workers the means of production)

4667 2018-09-21 21:03:57 So apparently I'm in a lot of trouble with my dad because not only did I "need" an oil change...there was literally no oil in the car...oops
4668 2018-09-21 21:03:56 This is unequivocally bullish for crude oil.

4681 2018-09-21 21:02:17 I'm sorry, I don't understand. If you know that, why do you continue to permit fracking and help Wolf speed up the permitting process? Why do you leave oil & gas out of your environmental justice policy? Why don't you cap all those o&a wells?
4682 2018-09-21 21:02:15 The hippies here in Colorado will love the idea of tracing back the oil to the farmer.
4683 2018-09-21 21:02:12 the tories have been dividing this country for 40yrs they hate the North, they hate Wales, they hate Northern Ireland, thay hate the South West & they have no use for Scotland now they've stolen & blown all of their oil revenue, all they care about is London & dodgy foreign cash,
4684 2018-09-21 21:02:06 Haha.nice try. Many of my friends lost jobs in oil business due to Obama regulations. Thankfully all working again thanks to Trump and rolling back regulations
4685 2018-09-21 21:02:04 I'd try a facial cleansing oil because they are more readily emulsified.

4695 2018-09-21 21:00:51 We were fine before oil patch. We will be fine after. Fossil fuels are the past. Renewables are the future. Nuke is the bridge.

4702 2018-09-21 21:00:04 No sweetie they do.. they ran out of oil he went to the shelf and thought I was going pay for it. I know you pay for the oil by the quartz not off the shelf
4703 2018-09-21 21:00:03 With respect, Minister, that is irresponsible garbage. People might be ignorant of the ruinous consequence of ‘no deal’ but anyone with an inkling of international trade knows it would be a catastrophe for the UK economy.  Snake oil to the bitter end, then? #brexit #torysellout

4711 2018-09-21 20:58:22 Thank you! The wood is red oak and the oil is kind of a tung oil with boiled linseed oil.

4727 2018-09-21 20:56:18 4.  USA nationalized industries World War 1, World War 2.

Truman discussed importance of coal to USA while President net.

Oil far more important to Iran than coal to USA.

Eisenhower, Congress overthrew Guatemala because of fruit. Dulles Brothers had investments in United Fruit
4728 2018-09-21 20:56:17 Greg, you've got some big name economists saying we could see 6-10% mortgage rates next year. Couple that with triple digit oil...WOW!!
4729 2018-09-21 20:56:08 It sucks! I have it too! Coconut oil helps! But since I’m in Hawaii I use kukui nut oil. 
4730 2018-09-21 20:55:58 It really isn't that bad. There's a soap with tea tree oil, it smells nice. 

 If you let it build up, they can get infections, swelling, etc. I.e. vet visit, which = $$$

4733 2018-09-21 20:55:35 Dilemma of whether to work in “negative” industries like Oil & Gas, Defence, Nuclear etc. Or work in a “positive” industries like Renewables, Healthcare etc.... Real data. Came to know about preference of millenials while trying to hire for about 15 positions in last 3 years.
4734 2018-09-21 20:55:27 The Pinocchio Test
The Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant.  1/2

4741 2018-09-21 20:54:41 Lavender oil rubbed on my temples knocks me out - I was very cynical until I tried it. I have a little roller ball bottle from Holland and Barrett by my bed now. Works every time!
4742 2018-09-21 20:54:41 I'm so proud of how well phils done in the oil industry and all his successes - but DAMN it's hard when he's away  miss him so much!!

4747 2018-09-21 20:54:10 They are selling because they know there’s no future in oil and gas expropriation
4748 2018-09-21 20:53:52 Agree! All I hope is we also get more sense of urgency. Chinese do it to reach multiple goals: 1. Get rid of oil they don’t have 2. Fight heavy pollution 3. Most importantly, build new sustainable export products. We miss window of opportunity for environment and economic gain.

4753 2018-09-21 20:53:29 Boy. Niggas won’t let you live when you get a oil change. Lmao
4754 2018-09-21 20:53:29 Oh also putting oil on before primer & Makeup makes a world of difference!! My pore literally vanished  #makeuphack #latetothegame #gamechanger

4756 2018-09-21 20:53:16 A little late for this realization! During the Chavez years Cubans in exile warned the Venezuelan people of the Castro influence and scope...they didn't listen...they could not  imagine that their oil rich country could become like  Cuba.

4762 2018-09-21 20:52:39 Enlighten me then. How are we going to export goods under a no deal Brexit?

How will we import medical isotopes? Insulin? Oil? Money?
4763 2018-09-21 20:52:38 @brucerossbrc A "Snake Oil Salesman " a PM? Of course a VISION of a New Reality! Elmer Gantry " like?
4764 2018-09-21 20:52:33 Yes.  And we have to balance that with potentially wasted investment in oil infrastructure that might not be needed in 10-20 years versus new clean energy investment that our future generations will be dependent on.
4765 2018-09-21 20:52:29 Movies needed wranglers, costumes, props, set builders, caterers, and many outside contractors plus businesses to cater to the newly wealthy stars.  Tank farms and refineries for oil. Trucking for crops and products. Dad was a machinist who went west.  All the coast boomed
4766 2018-09-21 20:52:26 Oh hell nah  since when is coke better they clean oil off the drive thru  with coke at my job  Lmaooo
4767 2018-09-21 20:52:16 The real truth is that this is trump change for Zinke. Acouple more small gold exploratory mines ... throw them a bone.
Oil and gas is where the money is. And that is who pays Zinke.

4776 2018-09-21 20:51:06 Justice used the toilet seat covers to wipe the oil off his nose LMAO
4777 2018-09-21 20:50:52 I seem to recall it was your country that illegally invaded and destroyed Iraq, killed at least a million people, installed a corrupt government, stole their oil and built permanent bases there. I wonder how you can be this much of a fucktard hypocrite with a straight face?
4778 2018-09-21 20:50:35 on the bright side i got a $300 cowboy hat for $29 at the thrift. i feel like feel like some big fancy oil tycoon.
4779 2018-09-21 20:50:32 Dirty polluting coal, old fashioned oil, and a little sustainable energy.  Old energy because @realDonaldTrump wants to rewrite Science and deny climate change.
4780 2018-09-21 20:50:26 Just on my car today I spent almost $200 just for oil change , gas & car wash like wtf 
4781 2018-09-21 20:50:02 Nah.. I won't... Soon as I'm done with this prescription I'm going back to my home made (Rick Simpson) oil 
4782 2018-09-21 20:50:00 So I’m getting my oil changed... and the lady next to me is eating fries. I’m about to ask for some 
4783 2018-09-21 20:49:52 I can you’re very old! 
4784 2018-09-21 20:49:45 Yes and the massive oil companies have that cash. Don’t be fooled.  They barely have to pay anything to clean up tailings and spills.  So when I hear ‘ this will be the most safe pipeline ever’ a lot of us have serious doubts
4785 2018-09-21 20:49:43 Also if oil came from the billions of decomposing animals right now we won’t have any fuel problems, oil is created under very specific conditions which is not at all related to what the meat industry is pulling
4786 2018-09-21 20:49:43 Need beard oil suggestions!!!
4787 2018-09-21 20:49:29 Madge would have gone to El Paso because her husband became a professor.

Post WWII California was booming. Farmers and dumb labourers could get jobs. Agriculture, docks, machine shops, sweatshops, oil fields, movies, and planes called people west.
4788 2018-09-21 20:49:25 Why we are now number 1 in oil and gas production. Why we have a thriving economy.  Why this is beneficial for our security and the security of NATO nations.  Why GDP is approaching 3 to 4% (not the anemic 1.5% when Obama left).  #MAGA
4789 2018-09-21 20:49:24 Ummm I just stick to basis soap to wash my face bc I have sensitive skin and it’s nonscented and oil of Olay since I was like ten and myy skin is as good or better than my grandmother and mother so yeah it’s so old school and perfection

4791 2018-09-21 20:49:14 Three years if at all. Meanwhile, Russian oil is being delivered to Washington state because we can't meet demand.
4792 2018-09-21 20:49:10 Brent crude surpassed the $80 a barrel mark ahead of a meeting of energy officials who are meeting this weekend to discuss output policy as US sanctions on Iran’s oil exports already begin to restrict supplies.

4794 2018-09-21 20:49:00 Thank you I’ll look into it! I def need some oil control lol
4795 2018-09-21 20:48:57 They might be having those breakthroughs more often (I'm not sure) but if they're not, then I think just like them the gaming industry is just trucking along until it hits oil again.
4796 2018-09-21 20:48:46 A filling of chorizo, mozzarella, chilot, medium chillies, chili olive oil, fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, tinned tomatoe, a touch of turmeric, sauce no chorizo but more chillies
4797 2018-09-21 20:48:43 I'd say child-labor is pretty up there as well, but palm oil is definitely a big one.
4798 2018-09-21 20:48:39 if i had oil paints n canvases I’d be unstoppable n able to drop out of college, but i don’t have money to buy those things bcuz I’m paying for college. yeehaw to that. #wholetmedothis

4800 2018-09-21 20:48:31 Nelson has served the people & environment honorably. Unlike you who has been in office 8 years, wasting billions of taxpayers money, polluting our waters & air, decimating preserves for oil pipelines. You SUCK slick Rick. #NoMoreRickScott

4802 2018-09-21 20:48:24 What’s the news and action to be taken regarding all the sewage from Vancouver and Victoria that’s has closed beaches due to the mass continuous dumping?  Don’t think the whales like this pristine water being poluted.  This is a sure thing and an oil spill is a maybe.  Hmm
4803 2018-09-21 20:48:14 How’s that @Saudi_Aramco IPO going?
4804 2018-09-21 20:48:12 Those ribs musta been trash then! Jajaja you made them?? Jussss keeeding.  You better get some CBD Oil and relax this time around! Wooosaaaah! 
4805 2018-09-21 20:48:08 i would personally go with the steamed chicken or the brisket! chicken can be a good starting point since it lets you focus more on the flavor of the broth. i would try and make sure they give you some chili sauce/oil to put in it cus that's how i like mine!

4808 2018-09-21 20:47:58 It's a breath of fresh air when impartial market watchers publicly claim "Oil prices have remained lower of late, due to donald trump's repeated rhetoric directed at OPEC"
4809 2018-09-21 20:47:48 Palm oil deforestation!!!
4810 2018-09-21 20:47:41 Why is @SecretaryZinke meeting with gas and oil execs saying he'd rather represent them?
4811 2018-09-21 20:47:21 Whose oil?
4812 2018-09-21 20:46:59 Ain't much to do in this place except clown with your friends, go to dt, work a part time (or the oil rigs) , go to STC, go to UTRGV, graduate, get pregnant, and start a family. I know there's more than this for me. I'm stuck here.
4813 2018-09-21 20:46:57 My 1st sexual assault (not rape) happened in front of stepmother. She beat me bloody for injuring uncle when I jerked away from him (I was 11, cooking sausage, some drops of oil splattered him). When I reported what happened to my mom, she didn't believe me. #WhyIDidntReport
4814 2018-09-21 20:46:57 I believe it's 0.5 ml a week

Is all seed oil shit? No advantage to grapeseed or sesame as an alternative?

I went from 550 to 950 total, 8 to 15 free. Workouts have improved, & I get pissed off a lot faster but other that don't feel different. Energy levels haven't changed.
4815 2018-09-21 20:46:51 Your are an oil industry front.
4816 2018-09-21 20:46:39 No, it's ok if the oil is good. 

Maybe one is enough.
4817 2018-09-21 20:46:36 Although these asshats don’t represent the majority of Oil fans, it does get tiring seeing us portrayed this way. Every fan base has awful fans among them.

4827 2018-09-21 20:45:46 I don’t care our taxes are too high for everyone.  Bernie wants to raise taxes and hand out free gov. run social programs that will crush our economy.   You have to look at the big picture. The tax cut is strengthening our economy he can’t sell his snake oil in this environment
4828 2018-09-21 20:45:42 Reps are pretty much like that too, I already said. Meanwhile, $hillary said she was for environment protection and taking millions from oil producers, saying she wanted wages raised and taking millions from the Walton’s (biggest opposers to min wage raise ever)..see the picture?

4832 2018-09-21 20:45:25 actually, there’s an essential oil that can help you with that sort of negativity... ;)
4833 2018-09-21 20:45:23 Well, today I got almost every thing done. You know how I had deja vu I got really lucky today. I debated today whether or not I wanted to get an oil change with the money that I had and because I had to run to the bank there was a place right behind the bank so I went ahead and

4837 2018-09-21 20:44:57 US $ is at least two thirds supported by US land use values. Bullion still has a vestigial trust role in short term clearing: in relation to trade flows & spot exchange rates it's pretty irrelevant. If China offers more gold for oil then oil flows into China & gold flows out

4839 2018-09-21 20:44:41 I don't think the average person knows the names of the conglomerates who own the brands we see, but it's the dudes making the most profit from oil, for the longest time.

4841 2018-09-21 20:44:38 So much bullshit! Just yesterday, Fuhrer Shitler was complaining, not knowing that the U.S. produces more oil. Fighting for farmers? We're not seeing it in Kansas! Or California, Florida, or Texas! You've cut off our foreign markets, cut off our labor supplies, cut off our lives!

4846 2018-09-21 20:44:12 We give away our resources for next to nothing hoping to make our money off the income taxes and economic activity from construction. 

We are basically the only major oil exporting nation on earth that hasn't nationalized the industry in any way
4847 2018-09-21 20:44:07 Ur almost on your own in ur opinion. Russia’s first operation was to bomb conveys of ISIS controlled oil trucks selling oil thro Turkey. Removing ISIS cash funds upset u? Aleppo got freed with Russian help. My head is buried in the sand? U closed my day with a laugh  night!

4852 2018-09-21 20:43:57 early on stuff required oil/coal to build, but not to maintain. i was assuming there would be some benefits to only using renewable energy sources, but it actually just prevents u from proceeding through the game. i’ve got it all figured out now tho, i think!

4870 2018-09-21 20:41:58 Yes but we need to do it at the pace of all the other oil producing countries. In this case being a leader is causing huge economic and job losses. We are such a small footprint when it comes to pollution. People need to start focusing on the bitmining companies power consumption

4872 2018-09-21 20:41:26 @WBrettWilson if the NEB also had to evaluate the effects of continuing oil by rail, the argument of a pipeline would be over. #TransMountain would be approved in a pinch.

4887 2018-09-21 20:39:50 So do you support the Liberal government's effort and progress on twinning the pipeline?

So you admit that they've been doing a better job on Oil and Gas than the Alberta Conservatives and the Federal Conservatives?

4980 2018-09-21 20:27:29 OPEC is not a "monopoly".  You really do not know economic terms very well.  Sure you went to Wharton?

OPEC is a cartel of oil producing nations. A monopoly is a single producer or source of a given product in a market.  There is no "monopoly" of oil producers. 

Jeez.
4981 2018-09-21 20:27:16 The Energy East option always looked like the best option for Canada to me, except for politics. As we import oil we are expected to believe there is a market across the Pacific for Alberta ‘s tar sands. There is a marine economy worth protecting as well,

4983 2018-09-21 20:27:10 Aother examplen is your first car, seems nice to drive and cool, till you're clueless asf about how to maintain it by regularly getting an oil change and check for maintenance problems Everything is trial and error, till you finally get it fully

4988 2018-09-21 20:26:52 “You might work from home If... “ your oil changes are always based on time vs mileage
4989 2018-09-21 20:26:51 The US is not dependent on foreign oil, and your promotion of burning more gas that is made cheaper and less efficient by subsidized corn production actually increase cost of corn-based food. Why not advocate solar and wind energy in SD? Global warming is real. VOTE DEMOCRATIC.
4990 2018-09-21 20:26:46 I been smellin coconut oil everywhere shit smell so good tho lol
4991 2018-09-21 20:26:43 I carry annoited olive oil everywhere i go, can't take risk
4992 2018-09-21 20:26:26 I sure hope so...we live in one of the largest countries in the world not connected by pipeline...we would rather import & refine oil into the maritimes rather than build a pipeline from Alberta...or ship oil buy rail & have 47 people perish in a terrible accident in Quebec???...
4993 2018-09-21 20:26:12 The US is one of the lower subsidized countries as far as oil goes, but that's not counting the already subsidized oil they buy from other places either tho.
4994 2018-09-21 20:26:12 And if China's "oil price of gold" is better than that on offer elsewhere, mkts will do what mkts do...phys gold & oil will both flow to China, & it won't take long for such phys movements to "break" western bullion mkts (that function to support the USD & USD-centric system)
4995 2018-09-21 20:26:05 Have you ever smelled tea tree oil?  It is not my fav, let's keep it at that.
4996 2018-09-21 20:25:45 Bill rosenstein trying to impeach trump on wire tap who do you trust the oresidentvsubmitted to group prayer laying on hands no samuels oil yet.
4997 2018-09-21 20:25:35 Scotland currently keeps Engerlund afloat, I we are Independent we retain 100% of the tax on Oil,Gas, Whisky, Foodstuffs etc etc not the 8% we are given as loose change, WTF are your mob going to do.......starve!!
4998 2018-09-21 20:25:00 If this province were run as ‘smartly’ as Irving Oil, you’d have more efficiency for your tax dollars and people would be held accountable to certain ‘high’ standards that seem missing these days.

5001 2018-09-21 20:24:15 Think I’m gonna try castor oil tonight to induce these contractions 
5002 2018-09-21 20:23:56 So I basically guessed what compound you were going to get out of menthol... :)
BTW, linalool may also be worth trying. Not sure though if it is as available as 4-terpineol from tea tree oil and if one additional double bond won't degrade performance even more.
5003 2018-09-21 20:23:46 This sun + this castor oil is baking tf outta my scalp 
5004 2018-09-21 20:23:22 Guy at tire shop: “you’ve got a check engine, oil change & tire pressure light on.”
-is that what those are? you mean the one that says ‘oil change due’ is literal?) 
Me: “I know” (why I’m here).
2 min later...
Guy: “your car needs service”. 
Me: “I know, thanks”

5008 2018-09-21 20:22:28 Well.. I rather natural even though it's illegal (in my country it's legal tho).. Oil is good, but can be too strong, I've tried in any form and will die with the joints.. 
5009 2018-09-21 20:22:27 @NanaAnsah20                               Only shadow minded people and the likes of the NDC always trumpet  liars .
Am of the opinion that the, NDC are more confused than reorganizing their Party as a whole.
It’s also a shame that they refuse to acknowledge the world oil price.

5012 2018-09-21 20:22:09 It's me, the Savvy Shopper. I let a groupon for those giant heads you see at bball games expire and used the credits to get an oil change for free. This has been the saavy shopper.
5013 2018-09-21 20:21:58 is that mayo/egg/olive oil hair mask just a puerto rican thing? lol
5014 2018-09-21 20:21:34 Dente? Discussion? Plain best. Although, one accurate comment would be every player is the best player they have had ever in any position. It’s called OIL MONEY.

5024 2018-09-21 20:20:03 It's a total deceit, just free the plant not the weak CBD that doesn't heal. It's the true THC HEMP OIL THAT HEALS. Free the plant and get out of the way already.

5035 2018-09-21 20:18:48 How do you explane the oil and gas you put in your car, you do know what it is right?
5036 2018-09-21 20:18:43 You cant educate kids who dont care. Adding more is like adding oil to a blown motor.  Let them have a chance at actually having a skill by 18.
5037 2018-09-21 20:18:42 sure, but w/ less crush in China, soy oil deficit increases, right?
5038 2018-09-21 20:18:36 They cannot simply invalidate a warranty, you do need to use parts of equal quality though. If you use the wrong grade of oil and the engine seized then yes they wouldn’t pay, but it doesn’t effect other parts of the warranty that have nothing to do with the oil.
5039 2018-09-21 20:18:35 You threw a stone at me and it cracked open my oil. You cracked open my anointing

5046 2018-09-21 20:17:33 I keep seeing these posts about oil changes so lemme gone head and get one
5047 2018-09-21 20:17:24 They pay for the oil on time because they don't want to rebuild the fields. Chavez did the right thing the US just made sure he didn't succeed. But I'm sure you already know this. How would you profit personally if we return to power in your country? Maybe we will let you eat?
5048 2018-09-21 20:17:10 These people think yoga and CBD oil will cure cancer. Not even kidding.

5053 2018-09-21 20:16:54 China owns them now. Recent agreement with China on Oil. 
Big Mistake. Now that US under the Trump administration has gotten smarter,China’s needing to seek others who are in need. Think about it! It was China who was running our show here, “Visa’s from 1 yr. to 5 under Barry.

5119 2018-09-21 20:09:31 Buddy really tried to make me pay $60 for a oil change.  I’ll do it myself.
5120 2018-09-21 20:09:24 We could easily turn back to glass and paper but that would mean a plan to plant more forests and build more recycling plants, and there’s no money in them. Oil is king. Plastic is cancer.
5121 2018-09-21 20:09:14 @SenKamalaHarris hahaha, 2 peas in a pot, no oil,,,,Burn!
5122 2018-09-21 20:08:51 I just dropped a full bottle of tea tree oil on my bed. It was drenched! Even after cleaning up the whole room still smells like it 
5123 2018-09-21 20:08:39 I just started keto, I cannot stomach fatty proteins (I cut the fat off steaks, pork etc. 
I am limiting my heavy cream and cheeses  to the amounts indicated on your “pg 4”
and I measure out 28 gm of almonds. The bulk of my fat is coming from olive Oil and butter. Is that ok?
5124 2018-09-21 20:08:16 I think we're going to try getting her on CBD oil, then give her small amounts of gummies (not enough to have an effect) just so get her comfortable with the substance. Then she can try a vape pen.
5125 2018-09-21 20:08:11 thought i found a cool way to smoke leftover oil in a bowl but i just ended up really high and smoking the coating off a paperclip...
5126 2018-09-21 20:07:58 Best Essentials Oils for skin care 

Tea Tree Oil - treats acne, removes dark spots 

Frankincense Oil - fades strecth marks, heal wounds

Sandalwood Oil - prevents skin aging , treats blemished skin 

Lavender Oil- soothes skin, removes wrinkle
5127 2018-09-21 20:07:57 When we stop oil from reaching you, you will not be safe 
5128 2018-09-21 20:07:48 Haha, if I were to go that route, I’d want to do it legally. And I’d go with the oil, not the joints
5129 2018-09-21 20:07:40 I'd hate to be in your shoes when God examines your life... "Franklin you talk the talk..... but you don't walk the walk...you are a $ hungry snake oil salesmen... anyone can memorize the Bible"
5130 2018-09-21 20:07:31 Well  I guess I should just take my side hustles very strongly ....
Time to dust my old Agric notes and oil the sewing machines in the house
5131 2018-09-21 20:07:27 Today we celebrate JATA’S Busiest Man of the Summer HARDEE T. LINEHAM! Principal Role on YouTubeRed Series 'Wayne' (2018), Recurring Principal Role on Netflix Series 'V-Wars'(2019), Support Lead on Historical Feature Film 'East Texas Oil'(2019)! Fantastic work this season HTL!!!
5132 2018-09-21 20:07:25 So we drove to the car dealer for an oil change and tire rotation and as we pulled up the radio was playing Ghostbusters and when we got to the checkin guy he said "Picking up or dropping off?" and I about lost it.
5133 2018-09-21 20:07:19 Wow! Oil paints you mentioned? Cool!
5134 2018-09-21 20:07:05 Oh .... its not “their” oil .... #itsBritish ...
5135 2018-09-21 20:07:03 Saudi Arabia becomes the 3rd Strategic Partner in CPEC and will invest $10 billion in CPEC related projects esp Oil City Project in Gwadar, Balochistan. PTI led govt headed by IK convinced China to hand over oil city project to Saudi Arabia. A good breakthrough indeed...
5136 2018-09-21 20:07:00 Water and oil don't mix hence oil slicks after oceanic oil spills (oil suspended on top of water due to buoyancy).   Marine life is "wet" with oil when you see the pictures of rescuers trying to save them not because of the water. Same with liquid mercury etc.
5137 2018-09-21 20:07:00 This is awful. After Katrina one of the oil factories spilled out so there were Many houses with water and oil. This is terrible

5141 2018-09-21 20:06:44 We have just blocked @schneiderleonid b/c he told us to buggar off after we had told him to take a hike (after he'd accused us of being an oil industry front). He clearly does not want to chat about #climate science. We are okay w that. Have a nice day, Leonid.
5142 2018-09-21 20:06:40 #BearsEars needs to be on that list. Along with any other national monument, on land or under water. Keep our coasts free from seismic testing and oil drilling, and your claim will be more plausible.
5143 2018-09-21 20:06:28  really? I should not laugh! But really? Same snake oil, different look!
5144 2018-09-21 20:06:03 Bunch of lettuce vinaigrette, olive oil and tzatziki sauce is da bomb.
5145 2018-09-21 20:05:58 My mom found a juul pod in my room and goes “what is this?? Does it have marijuana in it??” And I was like nah girl it’s just nicotine, you’re thinking of dab oil 
5146 2018-09-21 20:05:56 When I was young I raced motocross and back then all the engines were two-stroke, which took a mixture of oil and gas, and I loved the exhaust smell. It’s a nostalgic rush when I randomly get to enjoy that smell these days!
5147 2018-09-21 20:05:50 Pretty sure this is a mood.  Also, yesterday I went to Dim Sum House for lunch and had wonton soup AND szechuan oil dumplings, and we had some steamed mandoo earlier this week.  TLDR I want dumplings.
5148 2018-09-21 20:05:43 @lizziespeller @johnredwood what, machine oil?
5149 2018-09-21 20:05:42 I agree with her position. Oil is far more cost effective then wind generated power. Then again, so is solar and tide powered systems.
5150 2018-09-21 20:05:38 What do you use to oil your clarinet? Almond milk???
5151 2018-09-21 20:05:34 1)Not your mate 2) Your club was bobbins until Arabs pumped their blood soaked oil money into a club that was barely keeping a float. 3) Your argument that fans can’t afford to go to games when your club is practically giving tickets away for £17.50 is pathetic.

5156 2018-09-21 20:05:09 Who got them oil cartridges tho.. the real ones
5157 2018-09-21 20:05:03 Hey @reaIDonaIdTtump gave you $50 extra a month with his tax plan while the wealthy got millions and now you’re gonna pay more for a car AND you’ll probably lose your job!  @GOP he’s that snake oil salesman I’ve been telling you about...
5158 2018-09-21 20:04:50 i know this beauty supply store didn’t just try to charge me 20 dollars for the jamaican black castor oil leave in ...
5159 2018-09-21 20:04:43 You should watch @PumpTheMovie. We had this system, and oil made sure it ended.
5160 2018-09-21 20:04:42 Murders for oil
5161 2018-09-21 20:04:41 It was tough...until I noticed your eyes may have been watering a bit. Figured it was from the combined scent of hydraulic oil, diesel exhaust and manure
5162 2018-09-21 20:04:26 My Arnica oil is running low omg
5163 2018-09-21 20:04:21 There's a bus stop called capital oil. Omg. 
5164 2018-09-21 20:04:12 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.

5165 2018-09-21 20:04:07 Isn't it is clear this guy didn't have enough IQ to understand that higher oil prices also means American shale oil companies remain in black, though it also means Russia & Iran can just go on with job at hand without much financial worries 
5166 2018-09-21 20:04:01 We offer new technology proven to lower gas emissions from oil drilling well sites, if not eliminate emissions altogether, by using solar and wind power in a compressor that is designed to replace pneumatic devices that emit natural gas into the atmosphere.
5167 2018-09-21 20:03:55 Poor Polar, he’s going to drown.  Tell .Donald Chump’s billionaires to stop polluting the Earth, stop polluting the seas, and stop fracking for oil too!  #RespectThePlanet
5168 2018-09-21 20:03:54 Also WHY YOU GUYS ARE SO KEEN ABOUT A TINY NATIONS ELECTION! We have no OIL, NO DIAMONDS, NO GOLD! You people told us we will sink within 100 years time! Is it MALDIVIANS PEOPLES HUMAIN RIGHTS ARE TOO BIGGER THAN THOSE MUSLIMS WHO  ARE SUFFERING IN ISRAEL!!

5170 2018-09-21 20:03:41 It's so easy to make your own salad dressing.  Equal parts oil and vinegar, then go from there.  I like to add real sour cream, garlic salt, and pepper, stir thoroughly and enjoy.
5171 2018-09-21 20:03:35 It’s crazy I don’t use any type of oil in my hair & it’s still gets oily in about a week
5172 2018-09-21 20:03:07 And have our prestine coastline destroyed by a oil spill

5176 2018-09-21 20:02:17 Data mining is bigger than the oil industry. It’s sickening and will only grow as the Internet of Things becomes more pervasive.
5177 2018-09-21 20:01:52 Exactly.

5179 2018-09-21 20:01:47 I just saw yesterday that my TRT (Cyp) is in cottonseed oil.

I asked the ND about this and if there were alternatives. She said that the FDA requires all injectable TRT be in cotton seed oil in order to be prescribed

5186 2018-09-21 20:01:22 No castor oil? Nex ?
5187 2018-09-21 20:01:18 This is what US, UK and France supported in Syria against a legtimate, anti Jihadi secular ruler Assad. All to weaken Iran(whose regime is  criminal of course)  for oil , and for Israeli strategic security.
5188 2018-09-21 20:01:10 Me: you should really buy this stuff, it’s great
Mom: stop selling me your snake oil

5205 2018-09-21 19:59:12 @IainDale Er, meaning let's have Boris in?  Er, let's pour oil on the flaming issue.
5206 2018-09-21 19:58:51 Getting my first oil change right now. Wow. By myself. Wow.
5207 2018-09-21 19:58:51 yes, but we have the hacker culture, and its makes all the difference in the world.

that's what oil and gas needs. they need to meet their equivalent of hacker culture, which opens it all up and exposes every single dirty little lie out in the open, for all the world to see.
5208 2018-09-21 19:58:47 It’s already vegetarian tho. Just pure’d beans with fried tortillas. Heat up some vegetable oil in a saucepan enough to dip the tortillas. In another heat the pure up. Soak the tortillas in the oil for like 3 seconds. Transfer it and lather it in the pure. Roll them.  Done.
5209 2018-09-21 19:58:43 Mate not a patch on an oil slick at @WorcsCCC !

5213 2018-09-21 19:58:27 No. That's what restaurants and chefs do. It's egg and oil. Perfectly spreadable.
5214 2018-09-21 19:58:10 If vegetable oil is made of vegetables and olive oil is made of olives what’s baby oil made of?
5215 2018-09-21 19:58:08 Wasn’t the price of oil and gasoline supposed to sky rocket because of Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran deal?  Still waiting!
5216 2018-09-21 19:58:07 Some don’t really care about the content you bring to them, far as you’ll pay them babu ruwansu. Which is totally wrong  Allah dai ya sawake
5217 2018-09-21 19:58:07 @JPNadda @USFDA @nhsconfed @cannabisnewsnet @NCIAorg @CannabisTU - See surge in articles about beneficial effects of cannabis oil and even marijuana (Hodgkin, breast cancer, etc). Are they documented? Peer reviewed and gone through required trials?
5218 2018-09-21 19:58:02 I don't have valium - lol.  What is CBD oil?

5225 2018-09-21 19:57:24 Kisha just told me about this stuff called Olaplex that is supposed to be good for strengthening hair after it is died and Jamaican Black Castor Oil is really good too! & they sell that right in Walmart & Dollar General
5226 2018-09-21 19:57:13 Is he also selling snake oil on there too?
5227 2018-09-21 19:57:06 Wlh graduates for that matter, that's why no matter your profession ,just know what you're doing, as a printing press, printing this shit can cause you to loose jobs.

5229 2018-09-21 19:56:43 As you and type away with products made from oil...
5230 2018-09-21 19:56:42 And I'll clarify that "generally" bit; I don't go for lots of oil much in cooking unless it has a proper purpose and adds something to the dish. I don't just fry things for the sake of frying them. I grew up with grilled sausage and bacon too (never fried), so that might be it!
5231 2018-09-21 19:56:37 I like Tymers as well on Ukog LSE and Sting69.
That Eddie Temple man isnt bad either.
5232 2018-09-21 19:56:36 2 fixes for the anxiety.  valium 1 hour before but you need someone to drive.  or 3 drops CBD oil at least 1 maybe 2 hours before still might need someone else to drive....
5233 2018-09-21 19:56:33 You really think they are gonna get butt hurt? Yeah, right. They own the oil.

5237 2018-09-21 19:56:10 Buying oil from Saudi terrorist is a disgrace for all participants.

5240 2018-09-21 19:55:56 Curious that May says she will not break up “my country.”  

I think that means she knows damn well that Whitehall needs Scottish oil revenue and is throwing down the gauntlet against Scottish independence.
5241 2018-09-21 19:55:55 I dunno what brand they were, but they had like Olive Oil and something on them. They were like aggressively bad.
5242 2018-09-21 19:55:53 I get that. Never been in one & very likely won’t flinch on being in one, but I went to school with a lot of children who parents worked on oil rigs so seemingly heard a lot about near misses. I think I’d be more tense than normal.
5243 2018-09-21 19:55:51 But you just refuse to dig deaper and and ask those questions. Again I gave a few good reasons why. 
Politicians are puppets. Look to the banks and oil companies to see who runs the country, indeed, world. I go back to the sinking boat analogy.
5244 2018-09-21 19:55:39 No oil? Look, its a part of my big picture, but shouldn't you buy a few seeds first?  I'll kill the boar. Jesus Christ. Slow the fuck down.
5245 2018-09-21 19:55:31 Why are those blood thirsty Birom people protesting the draining of that pond? The answer is not far fetched, that's where they hide the remains of their victims after perpetuating their recurrent heinous crimes against unsuspecting victims.

5249 2018-09-21 19:55:02 He is the best. Really enjoy his posts. Funny how you get posters that you gel with. On the #frr LSE Moleinthehole is my favourite...infact I remember him at the shareholder meeting he even asked good questions then along with Dulwichman
5250 2018-09-21 19:55:02 almost makes you wish we had moved to renewables 30 years ago instead of just letting oil companies do whatever they wanted until it was too late

ДИАБЕТ?!?
Я сладкое ем настолько редко, что никакого диабета у меня до самой старости быть не должно. Фу, ненавижу сладкое, от него пить хочется. Нет, серьёзно, так очень "точно" описывать меня могут только астрологи.
5253 2018-09-21 19:54:50 didn't the Premier only cancel wine boycott after BC govt decided to turn to the courts? and the govt passed a bill that would allow them to cut oil; i.e. provide the mechanism. sure, some grandstanding, but isn't politics about grandstanding?
5254 2018-09-21 19:54:39 Nice! What are wood and the oil?

5257 2018-09-21 19:54:24 How is adulthood going for me you ask? I didn’t show up to my oil change appointment because I wanted to stay in bed. This “I’ll do it tomorrow” mentality is gonna get the best of me...
5258 2018-09-21 19:54:04 It won’t end in March. Scotland will push for independence and to take their oil back and join Europe. I suspect we’ll see barricades and brickbats in Glasgow before “Brexit” leaves our lexicon.
5259 2018-09-21 19:53:59 I’m trying the Hempbombs CBD oil, do you guys use that too? Or did I get bamboozled?
5260 2018-09-21 19:53:58 If it had been managed properly there would have been reserves to weather any vagaries of supply. Norway, who were the poor relation of Sweden and Denmark before the oil,invested their oil income which now makes more than the oil industry does. Called compassionate capitalism.

5263 2018-09-21 19:53:37 No - I don’t - level of ignorance is astonishing though. Once the Japanese and German car manufacturers leave along with the oil and gas industry - let’s see how the economics are then!
5264 2018-09-21 19:53:12 Krugman is awful, but I’m pretty sure he’s not talking about praising Kavanaugh as the ethics problem.
5265 2018-09-21 19:53:07 Infowars customers buying Brainforce with bitcoin, Iranians saving their money in BTC, and Iran using BTC to transact in oil are good sources of demand for BTC
5266 2018-09-21 19:53:02 i knowww  I’m mentally preparing myself. my doc told me to stretch myself with coconut oil everyday to prepare but I’m scared to be sticking coconut oil up in my stuff 
5267 2018-09-21 19:53:01 I haven't had my oil changed in like 4 years. I think it's a scam. Car's still rolling.

5269 2018-09-21 19:52:41 I still don't believe you didn't have any oil or butter...
5270 2018-09-21 19:52:39 Let me ask you this. Do you believe the marijuana movement is about CBD oil? I would like to see how many people actually use it, and how much revenue it generates. The marijuana movement, like alcohol, is about money, and getting high. Let's at least be honest.

5273 2018-09-21 19:52:23 it works GREAT for anxiety!!! my anxiety gets really really bad and the CBD oil i use helps me more than the meds i was prescribed!!
5274 2018-09-21 19:52:21 In Canada, we have unequivocally the highest environmental and oil&gas regulations in the world, if there is a leak or spill it gets cleaned up ASAP
5275 2018-09-21 19:52:04 Filled up my gas tank AND got an oil change today, really getting my life together
5276 2018-09-21 19:52:01 I'm so tired of extra virgin olive oil. Can someone hit me up with some obscenely sluty olive oil
5277 2018-09-21 19:51:56 You're absolutely right! The video and my comments were of a general nature and more philosophical, but those nights when my mind is racing and I need to sleep, our low tide oil is my go-to! We all need help sometimes...

5286 2018-09-21 19:50:39 Well if they consider that the alternative to the pipeline is more tankers running through the water to American refineries and more risk to the salmon from oil-by-rail spills, I'm going to guess the pipeline will do pretty well in the more detailed assessment.

5294 2018-09-21 19:49:26 The flavor is from beef. It makes up a smaller % than the oil they used to fry in, but the meat is still a part of the process. Not vegetarian

5296 2018-09-21 19:49:14 Yep, we're just not dependent on it. Less than 10% of daily oil imports come from Saudi Arabia.

5302 2018-09-21 19:48:33 You’ve no had a surplus in 40 years - £2 trillion debt and went cap in hand to the IMF before oil was discovered - even today Scotland provides over 40% of UK goods exported - don’t make a fool of yourself.

5306 2018-09-21 19:47:54 I just wanted my oil changed. I didn't wanna pay $41.50 for a $8 air filter. I don't want to pay for your upcharged crap. Your service guy couldn't have blown it out like I asked? Nope. Pressured me to buy it. Not impressed.
5307 2018-09-21 19:47:32 Take soy oil off the tariff list, leave soybeans on.  Problem solved
5308 2018-09-21 19:47:08 Still too much Pellegrino in the play. Particularly defenders endlessly backing off until the opposition are close enough to shoot. Wes Hoedt take note. And Cedric, for a shortarse you've got the turning circle of an oil tanker!
5309 2018-09-21 19:47:05 Imma try this! Good tip. Similar to what I do w baking soda and coconut oil! Thanks!!
5310 2018-09-21 19:46:56 It might be our oil in theory, but if our way of extracting and profiting off of it is in the hands of foreign investors and companies than its not really our oil.

5314 2018-09-21 19:46:37 Your words “400 large crude oil tankers”...

Aframax are not large, they’re medium sized. They’re the workhorse of tankers due to their smaller size and ability to serve most ports. They’re smaller than Suez max, VLCC and ULCC. 

I haven’t even mentioned the safety aspects..
5315 2018-09-21 19:46:14 I think its an oil tab.
5316 2018-09-21 19:46:09 The dispute is not so much about the ownership of the rock but the potential for oil and gas reserves in the surrounding seabeds.

5319 2018-09-21 19:45:59 Educate them first and see how innovations will fuel the economy. Sure we have a duty to pay our debt but with a teeming population of illiterates, who will you tax? Or how long do you feel we can continue to rely on oil? Why is it so easy to hoodwink the public?

5322 2018-09-21 19:45:25 Doesn’t change the fact that the Venezuelan government (socialists) mismanaged oil income, spending it faster than it came in, running up deficits, squeezing ever more money from it until it was unsustainable and they ran out of oil money. Repair the roof whilst the sun shines.

5327 2018-09-21 19:44:23 Do I have any twitter peeps that use CBD oil for anxiety or depression? Need some details on how you use it/average costs/ dosage. Asking for a friend 
5328 2018-09-21 19:44:22 CBD oil you can get with out THC. I live in Washington State and it’s legal but I only use CBD. I was told to use CBD for pain

5331 2018-09-21 19:43:58 today my dad told me that he was going to change the oil in my car while i was at school. when i got home he actually changed the oil, washed it inside and out, and filled it up with gas. i appreciate him so much
5332 2018-09-21 19:43:48 Interesting! My co-worker says she feels "high in the eyes" when she consumes 20:1 CBD oil (although her eyes look completely fine)  and I've had a client say that they felt like their "bones were floating" on CBD oil...a different experience for everyone!
5333 2018-09-21 19:43:25 Things that haven't cured my (incurable) illness to date: prayer, aloe vera, cbd oil, positive thinking, smiling more, eating more meat, eating less meat, drinking almond milk, sleep, healing crystals. And believe me I've tried them ALL. IN UNISON. What a night.
5334 2018-09-21 19:43:21 stopped my over thinking and chilled me out I don't kick off in a traffic jam anymore don't Vape tho just take oil unless u smoke !!

5341 2018-09-21 19:42:33 Full tank, car wash/vacuum , oil change & tire rotation .. I need for NO nigga 
5342 2018-09-21 19:42:26 They have. They have supported increased refining of the resources to add value. That would also mean it can be shipped in existing pipelines.

Short term that is the best strategy to get every dollar from the resource while we transition away from oil

5348 2018-09-21 19:41:38 You don’t address the formation of OPEC in 1970s. The Saudi Kibgdom has been able to use its immense reserves to undermine other oil producing countries.

Wow! I just thought you might be interested in a native owned and operated oil and gas company that has a realy good idea.
Yeesh.
5351 2018-09-21 19:41:20 I was explaining to a colleague how much oil just the US burns per day (~20 million bpd). If we lined them up (standing), it would be ~7,575 miles. That's about the flight distance from Detroit to Taipei, Taiwan (a flight our folks do often). He had been oblivious to the scale!

5381 2018-09-21 19:38:33 Not sure why this is any of your business. You're hardly an expert in any field relating to this case.

You pontificating like your opinion is needed is hilarious.

5383 2018-09-21 19:38:24 Ironically I live in Texas, it probably has to do with Swedish oil connections. Used to work in the oil field and lot of the Houston companies worked with oil companies from that area. 

IIRC correctly they were also one of the nations still doing well during the downturn.
5384 2018-09-21 19:38:14 I always find it funny when I go to get an oil change and they are like “do you want to add such and such” and im like “well...do I NEED it? No? Then no. ” oil changes are already pricey my dude lol

5398 2018-09-21 19:36:34 After coming under pressure from the Trump admin over rising oil prices, Saudi Arabia is set to use an oil-producers' summit in Algiers on Sun to reassure oil markets that it can fill any shortages that arise as US sanctions restricting Iranian oil sales begin in Nov: WSJ. #OOTT
5399 2018-09-21 19:36:33 I drink milk and put some oil that my mum gave me to help me sleep but I JUST CAN’T
5400 2018-09-21 19:36:30 And at week's end, what were they doing......... buying soybeans out of Arg. & Canada, who in turn will buy U.S. to crush.  2 US cargoes also sailed for China.  Btw.... Oil World is a good, long time oilseed analyst........
5401 2018-09-21 19:36:29 Good. Should be fun then. To bad Oil City dropped their spread passing game. They had some athletes that could light up the scoreboard. But the ground game seems to be working for them, too.
5402 2018-09-21 19:36:29 Pfft. No prob! Sounds like a walk in Hell's park smeared in cooking oil with no shoes.

5406 2018-09-21 19:36:07 Extra virgin olive oil :)))
5407 2018-09-21 19:36:04 Time to smuggle more Iran oil...
5408 2018-09-21 19:36:03 People should become more conscious actually. And this goes very seriously to us Indians. Our food habits are really bad. Our diet include unhealthy oil, extra spices and a lot of sweetened products. It’s toxic actually. We end up with pressure and diabetes at a young age.
5409 2018-09-21 19:36:02 What I mean is, Magnus is from Ogoni.. His Tribes locked their Oil well..If Tribes like Etche,okirika..Kalahari , .et .c Also blocked their Oil Wells...As a Governor where would Magnus get cash to finance the STATE.f Magnus go to Campaign/rally questions of ol blockage may arise
5410 2018-09-21 19:35:59 I don't see why. The supposed deficit is easy to rectify. Restoring tax on NS oil to 2010 levels brings £6billion extra not contributing to national infrastructure costs ie HS2 cross rail London Sewers Buckhouse Westminster and Trident! Oh and a too large interest charge. Sorted
5411 2018-09-21 19:35:41 @SHOPCHEAPYXO Hi sis i i got a question about the snake oil
5412 2018-09-21 19:35:31 Avatar was so great because it was methaphor for the Iraq war. Oil was the rich rock. It meant more in the time period it was released.
5413 2018-09-21 19:35:30 Shows how little you know. Canada is rich in and exports oil, gold and much more in raw materials is a much larger country with only 38m population. Would not work for UK. Sad a young idiot like you is so hell bent on supporting a cause than will so damage his own generation
5414 2018-09-21 19:35:23 The part about reserves is incorrect. There are only 26 million bbls of reserves under Alaska. There's 10 times as much under the ground in Saudi Arabia. Also, the cost of getting the oil out of the ground is 10x as much in Alaska. The rest is assertion.
5415 2018-09-21 19:35:21 And you are conflating the past with the future. A common mistake among oil industry boosters.

5418 2018-09-21 19:34:53 @jeremycorbyn I quite respect you but how embarrassing to see you regurgitate the "too wee, too poor for independence" garbage about Scotland. You know full well England would be on its knees without Scotland's oil propping it up.
5419 2018-09-21 19:34:46 for your babies I highly recommend Cantu deep conditioner and the cream for kids. The Carol's daughter black vanilla leave in is amazing for all ages. I also use hemp seed oil in between the leave in and cream for both me and babies.
5420 2018-09-21 19:34:44 getting my oil changed and of course they convinced me to spend more money than I planed 
5421 2018-09-21 19:34:42 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

5430 2018-09-21 19:33:24 They are also expanding rail loading facilities as we tweet to accommodate the excess oil to be moved.
5431 2018-09-21 19:33:09 Friends who consume CBD oil: anyone else feel psychoactive effects from high concentrations (20:1, 30:1, etc)? I feel mildly intoxicated every single time I ingest oil (regardless of LP, ethanol vs. C02, etc). Any research out there to support the possibility I’m not delusional?

5449 2018-09-21 19:30:35 That attitude might have been OK while we still had plenty of oil ( in the 80s & 90s). The reality is a little different today. We need to co-operate with our EU partners now more than ever

5455 2018-09-21 19:29:51 The sons of turbans in London brag about increased oil production in their reports since taking over #Iraq. In the same breath, they complain about a lack of funds. Of course, the treasury is empty—that tends to happen when money is wired to your families’ personal bank accounts.

5458 2018-09-21 19:29:31 Oh. Interesting. I'm surprised and happy that you pointed this out. I think I need to go have a look around. There's something going on with Venezuela that relates to their oil and a new crypto currency Chavez is pushing. The petro, or petromoneda, launched in February 2018. 
5459 2018-09-21 19:29:28 @UniversalToyota I just received one of your flyers offering “Buy one get one free” oil and filter change.   Problem:  Offer expires 08/31/2018.   (21 days ago).

5464 2018-09-21 19:29:07 But I don’t use terms like “cut a rug.” 

I probably should go check the oil in my horseless carriage, though.
5465 2018-09-21 19:29:03 I'm not a scent-free workplace requester, but I definitely value scent-reduced environments. People can wear fragrance around me; I wear fragrance. ... but being next to the fragrance hosepipe that is an oil diffuser or air-mister? *choke*
5466 2018-09-21 19:28:35 England's biggest export to Nigeria is refined petrol and diesel,much of it is originally from Nigerian crude oil.
5467 2018-09-21 19:28:18 I am at a car dealership getting an oil change and almost had a throw-down with the registrar so yeah.

5475 2018-09-21 19:27:17 This dealership I inquired on getting a Range Rover from called me as I was swapping out oil... overflow happened while I was in my office, bc my dumb ass forgot..

I jumped out my office chair like “oh shit”

Walked in the kitchen and yep.. my fears were true.
5476 2018-09-21 19:27:12 Man, I thought finding clear, confidence inspiring information on oil was hard, coolant is just nuts.  It seems about 30 kinds of coolant are sorta kinda mostly compatible with my car? It would make me very nervous to mix the colors as that used to be a big no-no.
5477 2018-09-21 19:27:11 I see a bottle of Tunisian olive oil in the background. Is that considered zero-waste? It's certainly not carbon-neutral since it had to be shipped in from overseas.
5478 2018-09-21 19:27:04 The best way to protect oceans and marine life is not to place them at greater risk of harms caused by tanker traffic and oil/chemical spills. No NEB study can deny this simple truth. We are wasting time and money on the wrong investments. @cathmckenna #canpoli #bcpoli #abpoli
5479 2018-09-21 19:27:01 We should be seriously looking at cutting ties with Saudi Arabia over their treatment of women and legitimate opposition. Make the move to push refineries to refine oil here for products for here and to elsewhere.tou always lose jobs when you export a raw product.
5480 2018-09-21 19:27:01 6-7% of Global GDP goes to oil industries, do you have evidence counter to this?
5481 2018-09-21 19:26:56 Lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and finely chopped basil from the window box.
5482 2018-09-21 19:26:56 How does that compare to carbon intensity of conventional oil from various places and then all the new fracking in the USA?
5483 2018-09-21 19:26:43 Make sure your nails are clean and oil free before applying gel polish as it will just peel off otherwise

5490 2018-09-21 19:25:26 Maybe different models of human/food relation-- at one extreme we're finely tuned--race cars needing 97 octane fuel & precise adjustment, at the other we're multi-fuel diesels running on cooking grease,  crude oil, bio, any old stuff, etc.
5491 2018-09-21 19:25:03 I currently use this weird virgin, unpressed oil on my face and it deffff helps!! But I’m still dry as hell LOL I may have to look into the rosehip oil! I use a couple rose water toner/sprays that I am obsessed with
5492 2018-09-21 19:25:01 apparently coca cola is trying to make a coke product with CBD oil in it and idk how well that'll work or if they even sell it but it sounds cool af imo
5493 2018-09-21 19:25:00 Going to the dentist is highkey like going to get your oil changed  they gone find SOMETHING wrong.
5494 2018-09-21 19:24:39 Yes, it is ridiculous! I have found pain relief in CBD(capsules, sublingual oil, vape, THC and CBD transdermal pain patches). It really does work. I also use legal medicinal marijuana until the war against pain patients is history
5495 2018-09-21 19:24:30 anyway I brought my car in for a prepaid oil change and instead of paying nothing I paid almost $600 for all the maintenance I can’t put off anymore

5508 2018-09-21 19:22:51 Wish I could afford to use CBD OIL every month, It works so good. But being on SSI I just have to use it when I can... It one of those luxury items that on my list of what to buy when I get extra money!
5509 2018-09-21 19:22:50 NNPC , oil money not properly remitted, crude oil swap is a corruption phenomena, non-proper declaration of crude oil lifted, all activities shrouded in secrecy and more...
5510 2018-09-21 19:22:43 I thought it was a normal price the first time, then we took it for an oil change and inspection last month and it was $86 for everything and I was like uhhhh I got ripped off
5511 2018-09-21 19:22:38 Going to Gym, then Dab lounge to get some THC Oil for a litty stream. D2 or Metro? Or yall choose.
5512 2018-09-21 19:22:30 Well then your smart money is on the petroleum companies ... they do more innovations that ANY sector, contrary to popular belief. There are more patents and energy reducing innovations from the oil & gas industry than anywhere else ... they just don't beat their own chests.
5513 2018-09-21 19:22:28 I'm at this drive-thru oil change. This is weird.

Although I should've guessed this convenience was more expensive.

5515 2018-09-21 19:22:25 Makes a very good anti itch cream. Just place in a bain Marie with oil and heat for a half an hour, then strain out the oil and combine the oil with coconut oil or Vaseline to make a balm. Keep in the fridge. Will stop itch from insect bites etc almost immediately.

5523 2018-09-21 19:21:30 Yes we know you are against ALL mining. Have you told your people yet that without gold and silver there are no cell phones, computers etc. Without copper there is no electrical wiring. Without oil forget cars, planes etc.
5524 2018-09-21 19:20:58 oh i meant like, it can’t be used to power anything at all, stuff only takes oil/coal. but maybe i just haven’t upgraded stuff enough to get the option to use solar
5525 2018-09-21 19:20:48 Studies have consistently found that following a Mediterranean diet - which is high in fruits, vegetables, healthy fats like olive oil and avocado, and plenty of fiber from beans and nuts - is associated with a longer, healthier life. @angelMD_Inc
5526 2018-09-21 19:20:44 In case no one else has noticed, lower 48 oil production increased about a million and a half barrels a day in the first six months of this year.  Since then, not at all.
5527 2018-09-21 19:20:38 Also, if you have stocks in oil companies exploiting Mexico's oil I suggest you sell before AMLO takes over as it is probable he will finally do what previous president's have refused, to build our own refineries :)
5528 2018-09-21 19:20:34 We would like to officially deny any hellportals on, or under, land owned and managed by Infinite Oil
5529 2018-09-21 19:20:28 Add that to the hog waste soup & ya gotta wonder how much of the region will be rendered uninhabitable. Wells could be permanently ruined.

NC may join Flint & so many areas affected by oil spills, mining runoff & worse: too poor to fix it, too poor to sue, too poor to move.

5536 2018-09-21 19:19:49 Might be a great idea, but if it crosses even 1 provincial border, it needs federal approvals, and with all the changes Sockboy has made, it will never clear. The federal government is against western oil and gas, so forget about it.

Fun times.

Fun times.
5545 2018-09-21 19:18:55 the recipe is in a cookbook at home (where I am not at the moment), but in a nutshell - smashed cucumber salad with crushed wasabi peas and salted peanuts. The dressing is toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar...

Oil screams; NIGERIA, I'M GETTING DRIED, LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!
5549 2018-09-21 19:18:16 Because I cook a lot with oil, I have large windows and low self-confidence.
5550 2018-09-21 19:18:06 กูไม่เคยงกกะเพื่อนจำไว้เหอะ แต่บางครั้งถ้ามันมากไปก็ไม่โอเคนะ ควรพอใจในสิ่งที่ตนมี แล้วก็ต้องมีความเกรงใจ เคยได้ยินไหม ความเกรงใจเป็นสมบัติของคนดี กูก็ไม่รู้ว่าต้องทำยังไง

5552 2018-09-21 19:17:53 Using a light exfoliate like once a week, tea tree oil (pure), vitamin C weighed you are putting it in your body or on direct areas of your face(TJ Maxx has some for $5), vitamin E oil gurl I’d go on but it would turn into a whole essay
5553 2018-09-21 19:17:49 This is the 7th “Sarah Thomas” account I’ve had to block. All peddling the same snake oil. Also “Sarah” has been Heather, Amanda, Ashely, a few others. Weirdly they’ve all also been “Stanford Nutritional Sciences Masters Student”...quiet the coincidence 
5554 2018-09-21 19:17:44 Sir, you work in insults the way some artists work in oil or clay. I'm going to have to add some of those to my own online arsenal. A tip of the hat to you sir.
5555 2018-09-21 19:17:35 ...whenever it suits them.  If you give the US cheap oil they like you, if you then try to nationalize oil, they'll get you killed.  That's historically proven.
5556 2018-09-21 19:17:33 I’d use my boyfriend for scalp massages. Rub this oil in nigga.

5559 2018-09-21 19:17:02 Summer by Imagine Dragons makes me feel like I'm in a pastel oil painting with long flowing hair and a white toga thing, looking out over a Greek/Roman balcony into the foaming ocean, and the clarity of this vision freaks me the fuck out.
5560 2018-09-21 19:16:51 I get a little excited to blot my face for oil sometimes.... it’s just so... satisfying (I’m weird, okay. I know)
5561 2018-09-21 19:16:47 Harper and Prairie Conservatives orginally supported the farmers .... until they got into power. They were screwed as much as all of us during the Harper reign. Also allowing CP/CN to convert grain cars into oil cars leaving grain waiting for markets and lowering prices.

5570 2018-09-21 19:15:21 my name is jarred and I can’t stop putting olive oil on everything
5571 2018-09-21 19:15:17 I couldn’t do it. The vinegar would drive my MCA crazy and coconut oil feeds bad bacteria in the gut according to my biome doc. But for a normal human this recipe would be great!
5572 2018-09-21 19:15:12 I...was going to recommend engine oil fairytales for your consumption.

5585 2018-09-21 19:13:35 FUN FACT FRIDAY! :) Truffle oil is a finishing oil not a cooking oil, it's created when truffles are soaked in olive oil. Truffle oils are generally not used in cooking, as the heat adulterates their flavors. #trufflesmystery #funfacts
5586 2018-09-21 19:13:30 Iraq has oil, Syria is about building a gas pipeline from Qatar to Europe, Lots of money at stake. NK has nothing we want; the only reason we would invade would be to protect SK and Japan from NK aggression. Even then, we would be reluctant due to potential Chinese involvement.

5600 2018-09-21 19:11:59 Hello stupid, just wanted to let you know that we have oil too (more than you) and we have gold, silver, platinum and freedom.. You have oil, sand and dirt and radical terrorism ruling your country. So really, who's better off? oh and we have women with shaved vag's.. so..

5618 2018-09-21 19:09:49 If it is not liberated the rest won't be either. The country is split about 50/50 with the US controlling a large amt (oil rich parts too), Turkey a portion & terrorists in Idlib (which is quasi Turksih control). Syria really only has about 50%, so it truly is partitioned
5619 2018-09-21 19:09:31 Frederick Koch was in bed with the Russians when he pedaled an oil refinery design that was too close to the Patent held by the Rockefellers. He could sell it in the communist countries. He then returned home & helped fund the John Birch Society!

5633 2018-09-21 19:07:37 They are educated all right.  Rolling in multibillion dollars in profits from petrol and the war economy that invades oil enriched countries.  Environmental destruction is meaningless to them.
5634 2018-09-21 19:07:31 That is the best solution to end tho senseless killings, since they don't want to behave like humans, every trade with them should be cut off ,till they come back to their senses.
5635 2018-09-21 19:07:31 You don't need to do that.. Just rob anointing oil on it before leaving the house.. You are covered... But hope it's sizeable.. Coz if not.. Please let it loss in peace...

2) lacks proper sewage 
3) lacks clean drinking water
4) lacks electricity 
5) lacks employment opportunities 
6) lacks welfare 

Whatever the people of Basra want (not only need), they must get.

5652 2018-09-21 19:05:47 So I had an idea at work today while I was cooking, taking milanese sauce which is extra virgin olive oil garlic, salt pepper and oregano. Draining it leaving the oil behind and brushing that oil on a pizza . That would be the best tasting pizza ever .
5653 2018-09-21 19:05:46 It is, the oil industry on the whole is subsidized for almost as much revenue as they bring in. This is due to countless times of politicians from around the world promising "cheaper gas" that gas doesn't get cheaper magically as part of their campaign promises.

5658 2018-09-21 19:05:06 Mu hunch is when it is said and done there's no comparable economic advantage. EV concept is not new. I will concede it is far advanced from the theories that claimed motor fuel could be made from water but the oil companies colluded to bury the technology.

5669 2018-09-21 19:03:40 I was sure I would need to paint this whole piece...but first...let’s just see what a little bit of Hemp Oil can do. Holy Cow! (Yes, it smelled like Cow in the first photo). Magic in a Bottle!!!
5670 2018-09-21 19:03:31 กูก็อยากรู้ว่า เคยจดจำคำพูดตัวเองได้บ้างไหม หรือสักแต่ว่าพูดกลืนน้ำลายตัวเองไปวันๆ เห้ออออกูเบื่ออออ
5671 2018-09-21 19:03:25 The 95% represents all materials w/ 5% in storage. Storing materials is not uncommon. Recyclables are commodities like oil, minerals etc + markets fluctuate regularly. The City works closely w/ 3rd-party vendor Cascades Recovery to stay up to date on the latest issues + options.
5672 2018-09-21 19:03:19 No. The weapons issue started with Richard Nixon when he partnered with Saudi Arabia to switch America off of the gold standard and onto the Petro dollar. And every President since him, including Obama, has bowed to their whims in order to secure cheap oil and fuel our economy.
5673 2018-09-21 19:03:07 I’m barley getting my stupid toes done too. I gotta change my oil in my car but idk man lol weddings are expensive AF even if you’re not the one getting married.
5674 2018-09-21 19:03:02 So in other words they will waste the money on more opioids to treat the addiction. How about hemp CBD oil to get them off. I was on for 12yrs for legit pain then took MYSELF off with CBD oil. Hasn't been a cake walk but 5 months off w/o my DR's help!
5675 2018-09-21 19:02:53 If by citizens you mean petroleum special interest. Protect “Big Oil’s” interest in our environment, in our health, and in our foreign policy. We need an 18 month after pill for this administration. #SwampMinion
5676 2018-09-21 19:02:44 I want to suggest that when one of us on Twitter is not feeling well, we should send 1 bag of Rice, 1 carton of turkey, 20 ltrs of cooking oil & cash amounting to #50,000.

If we all agree to my suggestion we can start tomorrow, I'm not feeling well, I feel body pains all over.
5677 2018-09-21 19:02:42 Jesus Christ, the oil money really has brought some right self-entitled and disrespectful shits out of the woodwork at the Emptihad ffs! Lyon have more of a CL pedigree than City do. Oh yeah, there’s also that little fact that Lyon beat them in their own empty football stadium!
5678 2018-09-21 19:02:41 Cocky and arrogant...dont ever be to sure if you current status...oil will come down within 15-20  years then youll only have big cities and theme parks...the answer it globalization
5679 2018-09-21 19:02:33 I told Fico that I need to take my car to get an oil change and all the maintenance stuff and he gets mad. He’s like why would you take it somewhere when you have me to do it.  he swears he’s a mechanic lmao
5680 2018-09-21 19:02:27 Every night, coat your eyelashes with an oil that stimulates growth.  You can use one of these oils:  
        - Coconut Oil
        -Essential E oil
        -Castor Oil 
You can either put the oil on your fingers, or coat it with a q-tip.

5685 2018-09-21 19:01:55 Obviously you're just Erdoğan's little toadie. Yeah, support the purchase of ISIS's oil and the arming of Jaysh al-Islam and Jabhat al-Nusra.
5686 2018-09-21 19:01:52 Proud of you for getting your oil changed though.
5687 2018-09-21 19:01:46 You know that you will run out of oil eventually, right? Your economy will crash extremely when you run out of oil you will be irrelevant unless your government takes steps to diversify it's profile so it's not just dependent on oil.
5688 2018-09-21 19:01:40 My favorite Gartman moment...and I do respect his work, was when he said "oil will be worthless in the coming years because of Saudi Aramco"

5689 2018-09-21 19:01:30 These people fried chicken wings and fries in old fish fry oil and bitch I am LIVID.

5694 2018-09-21 19:01:06 For grains, crude oil or for what?
5695 2018-09-21 19:00:51 China can price in what they like & the market will price in what it likes & will make the FX conversion at time of trade if there is one. Yuan, Euro (and gold) are all priced in oil: I reckon US has pegged dollar vs oil since end Q1 2018
5696 2018-09-21 19:00:51 JPMorgan today: "Oil and oil products: Iran’s oil supply risk will likely overpower risks to demand emanating from higher oil prices and US-China trade tensions. We raise 4Q18 Brent by $22/bbl to $85/bbl and 4Q18 WTI by $19.8/bbl to $75.83/bbl."  Supply risk > softness in demand.
5697 2018-09-21 19:00:28 See ehn.. Mad revenue like crude oil money

an egg yolk 
2 teaspoons castor oil
5701 2018-09-21 19:00:01 Peanuts are the most commonly roasted of the legumes, thanks to their nut-like oil content and relatively tender cotyledons.

5707 2018-09-21 18:58:59 I’m not a fan of coal. Natural gas would be the way to go for all of it. Oil sands are great reclamation project as it’s surface stripping and then industry spends lots ofreplanting native trees & grasses, cuz govt of  makes them and there’s actually land left over to do so
5708 2018-09-21 18:58:53 Crude oil
5709 2018-09-21 18:58:53 Gotta throw oil dry down on floor after chewing Redman in the shop lol
5710 2018-09-21 18:58:52 Then boom the oil was stolen before the drilling started..
5711 2018-09-21 18:58:51 Castor oil them! It grew mine a lot
5712 2018-09-21 18:58:42 Não. É chantagem mesmo !!
5713 2018-09-21 18:58:36 Repairing
1-2 tbsps olive oil
half a cup of honey
5714 2018-09-21 18:58:25 Being in the actually shop with the big dawgs instead of express is so much more exciting and interesting. I feel more peaceful learning and practicing new things rather than pumping out oil changes as fast as possible 
5715 2018-09-21 18:58:10 I’ve lived on that diet. 

Also pasta with olive oil and spices.

5720 2018-09-21 18:57:32 It was never about oil. Oil is just a means to an end of Greater Israel. These maniacs are not going to stop. No amount of innocent blood is enough.
5721 2018-09-21 18:57:12 Moisturize & shine
2 cups water
3 tbsp cornstarch 
1 tbsp jojoba oil
1 tbsp aloe vera juice 
200 ml coconut milk
5722 2018-09-21 18:57:10 Right.  So if a Merc (or FI) hit a barrier and broke a rear suspension mount, they would be able to change the outer carbon 'case' without penalty as long as the 'cartridge' hadn't received a big shock load.
As we've seen others get a penalty.
Though I remember an oil leak crack

5724 2018-09-21 18:56:32 I think this the time for those oil distributors tankers to go on strike once again as  this mentality of taking matters of national importance lightly   #BoraUhai will drive us to  early graves
5725 2018-09-21 18:56:23 I like to make random natural concoctions in spray bottles  plus I know what the ingredients all are then and that it's got no nasties. E.g. 3 drops tea tree oil, turmeric, lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. Dilute with water and spray it on your face as a toner :)
5726 2018-09-21 18:56:19 Don't listen to anyone. Anointing oil is the best.
5727 2018-09-21 18:56:03 Yea dude! It’s oil and egg. Both have excellent browning properties. No mayo flavor or residue.
5728 2018-09-21 18:55:54 It's sweeter if u mix both with a pinch of crude oil... then small onga
5729 2018-09-21 18:55:33 What has Badagry people did to this administration to deserve the worst road that has increased travel time to Badagry by 3hours? No Infrastructural developmental project has been commissioned or completed for the past 3years, Badagry is Oil producing division in Lagos

5731 2018-09-21 18:54:45 But it must be said that it is funny to criticize Edmonton on the basis of the production of surplus value by means of the refinement of oil, the appropation of which much of the wealth of Calgary rests upon
5732 2018-09-21 18:54:39 L'huile de ndika a fait des merveilles sur mon cuir chevelu  Plus besoin de chercher du coconut oil qui coûte très cher en plus
5733 2018-09-21 18:54:38 The fruit punch might have some oil in it.
5734 2018-09-21 18:54:35 For years, Shell had claimed that it only paid the Nigerian Government for the OPL 245 oil block but in 2017 Shell admitted it had dealt with Etete who had awarded the OPL 245 oil block to his own secretly owned company, Malabu, while serving as Oil Minister.

5739 2018-09-21 18:52:35 Why I try to put oil in my car cause I don’t have the time to take it somewhere. Ugh, FAIL! I need a handy man 
5740 2018-09-21 18:52:33 Unfortunately, when President Trump say "rebuilding" he is tefering to investment in Big Oil, Factory Farms & other Conglomerate Corporate Ventures
5741 2018-09-21 18:52:32 Yeah I’m at 32k miles and have never once had it serviced beyond one oil change so.... this is my laziness tax
5742 2018-09-21 18:52:27 Ahhh I won't swear because I was told also . But all mk increase oil isn't working as expected,,, if you have 7-8inches it's ok for average and normal girl.. above that it's useless girl
5743 2018-09-21 18:52:19 The regular pizza is awful, the deep dish is only redeemable because it's basically a loaf of bread soaked in oil topped with cheese
5744 2018-09-21 18:52:10 Mayo contains oil, the oil from the mayo would add color while the other ingredients would add flavor via Maillard reaction and all. There. My culinary degree has been useful today.

5761 2018-09-21 18:49:36 Payment from where? The oil we have and know how many barrels we are selling or the one we don't? Human capital is key to the development of any society yet we choose to ignore it in Nigeria. Of what use is infrastructure if there are no skilled manpower to operate it?

5766 2018-09-21 18:48:27 The blame Trudeau & the NEP for the '80s oil crash is a cult promoted successfully by politicians & US oil interests, consequently the followers are incapable of listening to any impartial analysis of what really happened. I use to be one. #cdnpoli #abpoli
5767 2018-09-21 18:48:20 Whatever one it is, us motorists need to block the oil refineries again, bring the country to a halt and stop being ripped off
5768 2018-09-21 18:48:09 Use engine oil
5769 2018-09-21 18:48:04 Stand out there and watch them put in the oil.  I do.   But don’t be like me, I’m kind of an asshole.
5770 2018-09-21 18:48:00 I would take no deal any day of the year rather than stay in a corrupt super elite cabal owned EU advancing us to a New World One Government Order.

5771 2018-09-21 18:47:49 Lots of players leaking oil today.
5772 2018-09-21 18:47:47 I guess we will worry about that when it arrives. Electric running cars are already here but oil is a big industry. I would worry more about high taxes and unemployment under Dumbocrats!!!

5806 2018-09-21 18:43:09 I need to set a reminder to get some coconut oil before I leave work. I forget every single time
5807 2018-09-21 18:43:04 Enough supply addition to affect oil prices?
5808 2018-09-21 18:42:48 At this rate you’ll have to buy me castor oil for my edges because you keep snatching it.
5809 2018-09-21 18:42:34 Nuclear, nuclear, oil, oil, oil....forget whirligigs etc
5810 2018-09-21 18:42:32 Yup. And that is a human rights issue.  We (oil companies) do the same and worst at larger scales with our oil extraction.

I & battery & PV producers are advocates for cleanly and humanly sourced materials.

You seem to think it is fine to do the same and "destroy" the resource?
5811 2018-09-21 18:42:26 @SecretaryPerry ...sex-...oil?....
5812 2018-09-21 18:42:22 out of curiosity, how would diffusing the oil prevent a topical reaction? It's in the air and could land on skin.
5813 2018-09-21 18:42:16 First thing my dad said when he called me was 'when's the last time you changed your oil?' And that's when I knew I fuckeddd up

5815 2018-09-21 18:42:13 The annual oil subsidies aren't enough?
5816 2018-09-21 18:42:09 Gonna use my new French rolling pin to make @BraveTart ‘s Apple pie. Macerating the GS apples overnight and baking it in the morning. Should I treat the new pin with Booz oil like a cutting board or just flour it a bit and roll on?

5820 2018-09-21 18:41:47 All she would need is a strand of hair, a little blood, or a or part of a clipped finger nail, and she could make oil’ girl heart explode. Cam5 have a restraining my order enforced if ya dead!
5821 2018-09-21 18:41:47 Hey oil change place, I’m a grown man. Don’t up-sell me on bullshit I don’t need.

5823 2018-09-21 18:41:39 If we decide we want to be run by fools without a plan, charlatans and snake oil salesmen, then we damned well ought to be allowed to. And if you suggest it’s a bad idea you are a TRAITOR!
5824 2018-09-21 18:41:31 The best way to eat frog legs is to slowly boil the frog to death, then remove its skin, clips its feet off, cut the legs off, dip in flour and fry in hot oil in a skillet.
5825 2018-09-21 18:41:27 The beauty of having a baby Drone is that it goes anywhere and everywhere I do with ease. So why not take it with me to get my oil and fuel filter changed.
5826 2018-09-21 18:41:23 during my first year in office.
Signed VA Choice Act and VA Accountability Act, expanded VA telehealth services, walk-in-clinics and same-day urgent primary and mental health care.
Increased our coal exports by 60%; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time high.
5827 2018-09-21 18:41:20 Oil prices headed up. The last four recessions began with rising oil prices. If oil prices spike, the economy will tank. Tick tock folks. Get ready.
5828 2018-09-21 18:41:05 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

5830 2018-09-21 18:41:01 #Cowspiracy really lays out a well supported argument for being vegan. Too many humans on the planet and feeding them with meat, dairy, and fish is completely non-sustainable destroying the planet well beyond what the oil and gas industry is doing.#Vegan #nonviolence
5831 2018-09-21 18:40:54 Why my oil change 80 something dollars smh
5832 2018-09-21 18:40:51 I brought my car to get an oil change and there’s a lady here waiting too and she’s taking all the snacks  calm down girl
5833 2018-09-21 18:40:48 Really, a pony?
5834 2018-09-21 18:40:42 Hi Gertrude. Your pizza with bacon and motor oil will be delivered in 3 min via airplane.
5835 2018-09-21 18:40:36 I'd show someone how to change a car tyre and how to change the oil
5836 2018-09-21 18:40:30 Maduro continued milking the oil companies & eventually with low oil prices it became unsustainable. The old saying - socialism works fine until you run out of other people’s (the oil industry’s) money. With a ready supply of oil money they didn’t invest in any other industries.

5844 2018-09-21 18:39:41 Doing some real auditing today: Oil change on my car, looking to extended warranty on my car, paying all my bills.
5845 2018-09-21 18:39:40 peppermint essential oil is nature’s popper
5846 2018-09-21 18:39:37 No, but they have Being Meat Beast Burger at a restaurant near me called Venita Rhea's & they serve it with ortega chilis, mushrooms & a chili infused oil. Brilliant. I add swiss cheese. 
5847 2018-09-21 18:39:37 If #DonaldTrump wants lower oil prices, why has he declared sanctions on #Venezuela & #Iran ?  Sanctions support high cost #USA oil, and create uncertainty for other potential producers.  No winners in trade wars.
5848 2018-09-21 18:39:29 So I called Walmart and ask for vacuum pump oil and the lady went to the vacuum suction to look for oil. 
5849 2018-09-21 18:39:18 Bitching about an oil change and my sister says she’ll just pay it. Lol thank youuuuuuu. I just hate EVERY thing about getting them. The people! The place! The fact they ALWAYS come back saying something else is wrong. I just hate it alllllll
5850 2018-09-21 18:39:11 At first Mean said that Saint is a strange guy, like suddenly check world oil price. So in this vedio Saint said that he didn't suddenly check it but Mean had asked him first that which gas is cheap because he know that Saint interest about cars, then Saint talk about this.

5854 2018-09-21 18:38:51 I found my dab pen that I lost 2 months ago and there’s oil still in the cartridge 
5855 2018-09-21 18:38:49 Very true we can't be safe with out you and you can survives with out our oil so here the deal continue keeping us safe or we turns all the oil to Iran and you fall BILLIONS & BILLIONS years back without our oils
5856 2018-09-21 18:38:44 Wash nails in washing up liquid beforehand to get them clean and oil free.
5857 2018-09-21 18:38:43 Lol got my oil changed and of course the people working gotta tell you that somethings wrong with your car and they told me that i needed new motor mounts
5858 2018-09-21 18:38:35 Billions of dollars are GIVEN to big business, the aircraft, oil and electronic industries and others. The Pentagon carelessly scatters billons of dollars without a serious check.  In fact it is said they have wasted over a trillion in the last 10 yrs. Just balance the budget!
5859 2018-09-21 18:38:35 Sure would be nice, if they could give him some credit. Can't liberals see steady growth in their IRA statements? Aren't they following the market and jobs report? What about us being the largest crude oil producer in the world? The past 4 Pres. too afraid to take on hard issues!
5860 2018-09-21 18:38:30 Deadly for the coal industry and dangerous for the oil and gas industry, therefore deliberately made expensive.
5861 2018-09-21 18:38:28 Right but like sesame or canola or olive or...? Burning avocado oil is nearly impossible but sadly it’s on the expensive end :/ Canola pretty much always gets the job done imo
5862 2018-09-21 18:38:26 Yes it is. 10M bpd equals 3.65B bbl per year. Total Oil in place in Alberta is over 1.8 Trillion barrels. Current Proven Reserves are over 173 Billion  barrels. Probable Recoverable Reserves are over 525 Billion. 

Easily 50-100 year supply agreements are possible.
5863 2018-09-21 18:38:13 I have a 12 pack of canola oil , gallon of crisco and a tub of butter for Trump.  Good for the arteries right ?
5864 2018-09-21 18:37:37 It's a teaching moment. If you work with liberal women especially, never meet with them alone, always have a witness present, preferably 2 or more. 
Restrict interaction. Use the Pence standard. 
Better safe than sorry.
5865 2018-09-21 18:37:30 With 1,000 degree output 4th gen reactors you could make methanol from seawater effectively putting a ceiling on oil prices of around 40-50 $ per barrel
5866 2018-09-21 18:37:11 I hateeeee getting oil changes. Ugh. Like bro. I know my tires suck. I know my car is gonna blow up on me. I know I need like a million dollars in repairs. Shut up. You’re getting on my nerves and making me anxious. Bye.
5867 2018-09-21 18:37:08 Just oil my bike chain
5868 2018-09-21 18:37:07 In essence if my brothers in the Niger Delta switch off the oil taps, this contraption called Nigeria is over? 
Nnamdi Kanu really screwed up, he should have gone cap in hand and appealled to the Niger Delta youths, with them on his side, this "arrangement" would have being over.
5869 2018-09-21 18:37:07 like what kevin, beard oil?
5870 2018-09-21 18:37:05 find something better than tea tree oil. Ill wait
5871 2018-09-21 18:36:42 Clean coal, clean nuclear, clean oil , clean burning tires.
5872 2018-09-21 18:36:33 I feel like Hot Mix the DJ trio and Hot Mix the combination of approximately 95% stone, sand, or gravel bound together by asphalt cement, a product of crude oil.
5873 2018-09-21 18:36:25 you may want to rethink the family and friends route......what happened to the Iran oil spike @realDonaldTrump fear  mongering?
5874 2018-09-21 18:36:15 It’s funny how these wars were largely probably fought to maintain oil flows to U.S. and now we likely don’t need the foreign oil. Atleast not nearly as much. Of course it’s not funny that people’s lives were destroyed, just to be clear.
5875 2018-09-21 18:36:07 my coconut oil is starting to solidify which means that fall is here for real now bitches
5876 2018-09-21 18:36:01 It's my best tho but that's life tho,my food could be someone else's poison. But wait especially when the Egusi oil is red and shinny ontop hehehe 
5877 2018-09-21 18:35:55 Regina got some oil, new wipers, and a new single light. She’s becoming expensive. I can’t do this.

5883 2018-09-21 18:35:16 Is it the rural areas that are suffering the most?  My psychologist wants me to investigate CBD oil for the heck of it.  She's curious about it herself and suffers from pain.  She gets it and gets all of us.  She's the best but so is my Psychiatrist.  I was suicidal in 2010.

5887 2018-09-21 18:34:54 Given the up, down, sideways story of TMX expansion. Albertans will not believe it is built until oil is flowing through the pipe.
5888 2018-09-21 18:34:42 Besides what have u really done in Congress besides protesting an oil pipeline and meeting w a dictator who is still killing his own people? None of that helps people u represent like the homeless people n those who need affordable housing!
5889 2018-09-21 18:34:32 This thread just brightened my whole day. Y’all are too funny for this and they are too wrong for not putting a drop of olive oil on that stone! 
5890 2018-09-21 18:34:30 @ShannonStubbsMP So you are willing to destroy the economy of BC and contribute to global warming that is burning up BC, California, Sweden and other parts of the world for the oil corporations. Shame on you.
5891 2018-09-21 18:34:29 (cont) the harmfulness of the vege oil is the same as using vege oil to fry eggs etc.. sbb amount is the same and the product is almost the same...tak nafi kan vege oil is not healthy but instant stuff is generally not healthy sbb ada MSG

5893 2018-09-21 18:34:18 After selling snake oil for so long...
5894 2018-09-21 18:34:03 I consider these wars to be oil subsidies to some extent. But on the flip side, North America is quickly becoming a serious nat gas and oil producer, partly as a result of turmoil in previously dominant oil countries.
5895 2018-09-21 18:34:01 Nah fuck getting an oil change I’ve been here for an hour

5898 2018-09-21 18:33:51 I've stopped buying anything from the EU if I can help it. Though I did buy an oil filter from Bosch the other day, funnily enough, it was made in South Africa 
5899 2018-09-21 18:33:51 that box be slippery like trying to walk on oil
5900 2018-09-21 18:33:43 just for the record Novak said OPEC would discuss 1mbd increase last week and oil didn't budge. 500kbd and oil tanks...

5906 2018-09-21 18:33:00 I'm about zero emissions, but BEV is already the answer. Get behind that, the Hydrogen cell has been used before to divert by the oil and auto industries, it isn't viable. Watch who killed the electric car
5907 2018-09-21 18:32:52 Every Pakistani knows Nawaz Sharif and all his supporters were corrupt and entitled to receiving commissions and cuts in all projects they undertook ? Be they building motorways, IPP’s or imports of oil etc

5920 2018-09-21 18:31:33 Oh ya, I try to look at all of this through a stateless lense, as much as possible. Meaning I am not convinced that in a stateless society, electric would necessarily be the best choice. Obviously I am opposed to subsidizing oil or electric producers.
5921 2018-09-21 18:31:29 vege oil used is the same stuff being used in other cooking too.. mcm deep fried stuff guna sunflower oil, which is also vege oil...

vege oil is harmful in excess amount sbb ada polysaturated fat. So the amount in 1 packet maggi is not that much. Lain lah kalo mkn every day

5924 2018-09-21 18:31:09 Looking at the other tweets Angelic Psalms made, I'd say the crazy is pretty consistent, though nothing else I read was on par with their thoughts on crude oil.

5928 2018-09-21 18:30:55 I acquired a couple of railway sleepers. Unfortunately they tend to have shakes, and oil from 100+ years of trains and rolling stock causes a bit of staining.
5929 2018-09-21 18:30:51 Who can you slow down with today? There is someone that will be impacted by being taught how to change oil, by learning how to budget for their house, or in face to face conversation in a living room.
5930 2018-09-21 18:30:50 Some #Saudi investment may come but this talk of #Oil transport via #Gwadar is bullshit. Most of China's oil requirement comes from the industries & cities on it's east coast , it's far easier to just ship crude there directly.
5931 2018-09-21 18:30:47 If only they had some oil
5932 2018-09-21 18:30:47 What about Scotland independence??? We voted to stay in the UK but you don’t listen and charge ahead with threats of a 2nd referendum which still divides the nation.

5937 2018-09-21 18:30:02 Left my shorty whip at the PepBoys to get a oil change on Saturday at 3, They supposed to call me back so I can pick it up. 6:45 roll around they talking about “oh the systems down, can’t let you have the car till Monday cuz it’s not gonna let you pay” shitting me ....
5938 2018-09-21 18:29:52 yo oil 
5939 2018-09-21 18:29:52 I was more that 5,000 miles past an oil change though so like I’m not complaining too much.
5940 2018-09-21 18:29:37 Went through castor oil then brooklux then spuit. All transitions were funny. One was a hunger strike the other one,well I had had enough of brooklux, I begged for speit. Do you know how desperate you have to be to ask for spuit.

5942 2018-09-21 18:29:30 this tar and oil smell from outside since they've been redoing the road is... headache inducing 
5943 2018-09-21 18:29:19 I went to pep boys for an oil change and now my speakers aren’t working. Someone please explain.
5944 2018-09-21 18:28:57 Two words to stop that cannabis oil.
5945 2018-09-21 18:28:56 He’s just checking the oil. What’s the problem here?
5946 2018-09-21 18:28:34 @AZEALIASPEAKS Hey Azea I got some blessed money oil Jezebel Oil etc let me kno
5947 2018-09-21 18:28:27 trying to slick a can of oil who you think you foolin ?
5948 2018-09-21 18:28:21 Its bcoz of difference in densities i guess...  like for example oil and water its because of diff densities...  or water and fuel or diesel
5949 2018-09-21 18:28:20 Can't take away from Gretzky/Green? amazing scouting of players like Benson/Mcleod/Maksimov/Safin/Lagesson/Jones/Bear all out of the 1st round something the Oil have struggled with the past 20 years.

5951 2018-09-21 18:28:03 Change your oil after every 3,000 miles!!!!!
5952 2018-09-21 18:27:55 ไว้มาสนุกกันอีกนะคะ 
5953 2018-09-21 18:27:34 @MelissaLeeCNBC "Hash oil" can be derived from weed using compressed butane.  It's like "radiator moonshine"  no telling quality or what pesticides were used on the pot.  Often the idiots blow them themselves up in motel rooms, "extracting concentrates" with butane.
5954 2018-09-21 18:27:27 Mitsubishi voided my warranty because I used Halfords for an oil change service and did not use Mitsubishi oil.
5955 2018-09-21 18:27:18 Lol nah she good. Got her oil changed and new tires
5956 2018-09-21 18:27:12 I worry all this inside “almost” invoking 25th Amendment but not is like the oil companies knowing about climate change in the ~1980’s but doing nothing.
5957 2018-09-21 18:27:12 Thanks mate.....   Oil based Eggshell 
5958 2018-09-21 18:27:06 Oil paint is so expensive.  Kinda why I went to acrylics.  Still have an itch for oils, I feel they'd take my portraits up a notch
5959 2018-09-21 18:26:59 Thank god for CBD oil
5960 2018-09-21 18:26:41 We have vegetable oil too what you saying?
5961 2018-09-21 18:26:40 And @paulkrugman since you're wrong about basically everything I'm not at all clear why you should be telling us what is right.
5962 2018-09-21 18:26:21 Data is the new Oil!!!!
5963 2018-09-21 18:26:10 I'd have been your friend for $650 and changed your oil. But oh well.
5964 2018-09-21 18:25:57 WTH? I loan C my car to take to the farm. Because hers needs a oil change. And her car is in Topeka now with her boyfriend. #ImaGonnaChokeAKid I was played.
5965 2018-09-21 18:25:55 Work, clean car oil change and then work again
5966 2018-09-21 18:25:53 Use 1-2 drops of marula oil rubbed between your hands to smooth out any frizz during the day, and use 2-4 drops when wet for extra conditioning if it’s dry. (Great in winter months) jut don’t heat style w oil in it!
And phomollient works well w heat styling, but I prefer pin curl
5967 2018-09-21 18:25:52 Hahaha! I've also started adding grapefruit oil to my water. Same kind of deal for burning fat
5968 2018-09-21 18:25:47 Someone is pouring oil into the water which is the Bob Mueller investigation.Very strategic. Wait for the Trump response which I'm sure will call for an end to the investigation.
5969 2018-09-21 18:25:34 If you want to stress him out just ask him how we might fund an oil fund #clown
5970 2018-09-21 18:25:28 Pretty sure this peppermint oil just gave me a headache
5971 2018-09-21 18:25:26 It doesn't get them elected but it gets a delay until the next line of BS surfaces.   That one is the new "save the whales" environmental study.  They will ignore Victoria BC dumping their raw sewage into the Pacific.   Sewage isn't oil.
5972 2018-09-21 18:25:24 Right now, we need oil and gas.  The industry exists to support that demand.
If anything, climate change is caused not by the oil and gas industry, but by not developing renewable energy sources quickly enough to replace it.
5973 2018-09-21 18:25:23 I can only vouch for the Turkey and Swiss on White with mayo, lettuces, hot peppers, oregano, and extra (extra) oil. But that’s all I eat when it comes to sub type sammiches.
5974 2018-09-21 18:25:11 ok it was arugula and i made a dressing with pear balsamic, olive oil, salt pepper, honey and topped with goat cheese and cherry tomatoes, simple but yum
5975 2018-09-21 18:25:09 By all means keep up this man bashing where all men, especially white ones are guilty UNLESS they can prove otherwise. 
Makes the Pence standard look pretty good.
Who would want to take the chance?
5976 2018-09-21 18:25:06 My car almost blew up on my way to work because I have no oil oopsies
5977 2018-09-21 18:25:02 If you brushed your teeth this morning you used oil.
5978 2018-09-21 18:24:50 Snake oil sales man this #AlGore is
5979 2018-09-21 18:24:40 Oh yes, received our first of many winter heating oil deliveries today. Any guesses how much the bill was?
5980 2018-09-21 18:24:36 It's been raining all day. My birdbath overflows, and I love seeing water gush out of the stone bath. Inside Rosemary oil is infused in the air, giving a deep earthy scent. The rain and Rosemary have grounded me peacefully.
5981 2018-09-21 18:24:35 I've been planning to oil it to see what happens!
5982 2018-09-21 18:24:32 Only the naive forget that the NDP+Libs wanted Harper to run HIGHER deficits during the worlds worst financial crisis in 80 years.  Only a fool forgets that Harper ruled when oil price fell to about $20/barrel. Trudeau's had it easy, wait till recession hits us.
5983 2018-09-21 18:24:23 I hope you will advise your customers of the DPF problems and premature oil dilution problems as you are required to do under the Consumer protection from unfair trading regulations 2008! @TraceyLandRover @TataCompanies @TataMotors @JaguarUKPR @Sytner @JLR_News @RNTata2000
5984 2018-09-21 18:24:22 Or just set a trap.  Grill with olive oil and a little lemon.  If it's anything like its cousin the rattler, tastes pretty much like chicken, flakes like tuna.
5985 2018-09-21 18:24:21 @McVities is the palm oil you use from a sustainable source?
5986 2018-09-21 18:24:18 Hmm maybe ColorProof shampoo and conditioner, Aveda phomollient, and The Ordinary marula oil. Curl creams, while lovely, would likely be too heavy. Phomollient will give hold to the curl, add shine and softness, and keep the frizz at bay.
5987 2018-09-21 18:24:08 Snake oil.
5988 2018-09-21 18:23:43 I read about tea tree oil and I exfoliated this morning! Thanks boo! The things women go through 
5989 2018-09-21 18:23:38 Year 5 have been exploring the wonders of olives and olive oil....just like the Ancient Greeks did. #curriculuminaction
5990 2018-09-21 18:23:34 Then clearly you made it wrong. Try frying it in olive oil then season it with salt, pepper and garlic salt and it is 
5991 2018-09-21 18:23:32 Dead end streets.
Garbage dumps.
Toxic waste sites. 
Bankruptcy lawyers. 
Prisons (starting with his)
Sewage processing sites.
Oil spills.
5992 2018-09-21 18:23:21 @olemwangi2 let marijuana be legalised, we don't have enough oil, gold and tea and coffee not doing well, let borrow a leave from those countries already legalised it
5993 2018-09-21 18:23:16 Life without a galbladder!!! My bathroom is my new chill room. Like this is really stupid. I dont understand how that small organ made this much of a difference. Like they said i should avoid oil....not that you might as well move into your bathroom. This shit aint right!
5994 2018-09-21 18:23:09 You might be part med if you get offended by how people use olive oil
5995 2018-09-21 18:22:58 In unrelated news, I have an essential oil diffuser now, which is pretty gosh darned pleasant.

It's like I got my own lil spa.
5996 2018-09-21 18:22:53 Just doing some end of the week chart review. If you traded Crude Oil today. My condolences.
5997 2018-09-21 18:22:52 Change your oil. Drink water.
5998 2018-09-21 18:22:36 Netflix & I’ll bring over ice cream , cones , toppings ... baby oil
5999 2018-09-21 18:22:36 haha! Is it really that hard? Get a electric car. No gas, no oil change. You equate those price reductions, the car comes out cheaper. You're welcome lol.
6000 2018-09-21 18:22:28 I’ve been needing an oil change since May. 
6001 2018-09-21 18:22:25 For big oil.
6002 2018-09-21 18:22:08 God is ministering to me right now to say this to the world because somebody out there needs to hear this and it may just be you....

GET AN OIL CHANGE
6003 2018-09-21 18:21:50 Given your answer, I'd like to up the bet to $100,000. Winner donates to the children's charity of their choosing. Your electric car doesn't work without oil. Send me my money.
6004 2018-09-21 18:21:33 "Turning circle of oil tankers" @MartinBayfield  #NewVSExe
6005 2018-09-21 18:21:32 Krishna knew that He steals .... But oil is only a form of Grace ... although He could steal cows ...
6006 2018-09-21 18:21:31 The joke does not fit this category. Look at the way it was set up. The writer obviously knew or at least suspected that olive oil is not used to fry Popeye's chicken. "Were" is the more appropriate form. A simple search shows that inexpensive veg. oil is used. #ContrarytoFact
6007 2018-09-21 18:21:25 going out 9 times in 11 days has actually fucked me up. jus almost put washing up liquid in my stir fry thinking it was oil 
6008 2018-09-21 18:21:24 LIES! You protect nothing but your very own interests. US bombs killing Syrian children via the Saudis? That's protection? US involvement is only to protect oil, not the people. How are you able to continue to hold up that long, lying Pinocchio nose of yours?
6009 2018-09-21 18:21:24 Why, oh why, did I think it was a great idea to sit out in 27 degree sunshine in baby oil?!?! I now resemble a tomato 
6010 2018-09-21 18:21:21 Lol I used to hate mageu bcoz of Castor oil
6011 2018-09-21 18:21:15 @VP and, with the hope of God and the help of President Tramp, by November, oil exports to zero will be zero and the world will get rid of it. The diet will be comfortable, the big day of November 4 is near.
6012 2018-09-21 18:21:14 Is @Coil = Content  Oil ? 
#coil #XRPthestandard
#RIPPLE #xrp #blockchain #XRPcommunity
6013 2018-09-21 18:21:02 Snap. Doing the same. I put a little olive oil on at very low heat in oven for about 15 mins as a final defrost option.
6014 2018-09-21 18:20:48 @VP We repeat, and we emphasize that the only way is a full boycott of oil, only a total boost of oil without a derogation can overthrow this diabolical regime
6015 2018-09-21 18:20:46 oil cleanse
6016 2018-09-21 18:20:40 @oil_asinus ขอบคุณค่ะ
6017 2018-09-21 18:20:39 22 months lol! This is clearly a very poor attempt to phase out the oil and gas industry. What a bunch of slime balls.
6018 2018-09-21 18:20:29 I miss our oil sessions of trying to find the higher plane of existences.
6019 2018-09-21 18:20:17 Finally getting an oil change !
6020 2018-09-21 18:20:01 Net net allowing our Lng to be shipped to Asia would probably lower emissions. Get them off coal! Meanwhile oil is going to be needed until it isn't. Why not help out your fellow Canadians. Your keeping us a prisoner of the Saudis and the U.S. by not allowing our own pipelines.
6021 2018-09-21 18:19:50 Yeah, next thing you'll tell us is we need to lift off Russian sanctions so that the US can buy oil from your BFF Putin.
6022 2018-09-21 18:19:50 A lot a places like that still wonder why they have issues.  "I don't know why my engine seized up, I never changed the oil or checked any of the odd noises out."
6023 2018-09-21 18:19:38 Car dealerships are so dirty. This lady came in for oil change and ends up getting shitload of "recommendations"
6024 2018-09-21 18:19:27 4) rub coconut oil on it. #Pioppi
6025 2018-09-21 18:19:17 45min for a fucking oil change
6026 2018-09-21 18:19:11 We need to remove our dependence on Middle East oil.
6027 2018-09-21 18:19:08 Peppermint oil for hair growth is ammmmazzinnnggg! Overnight results
6028 2018-09-21 18:19:08 You sound quite like Adolf Hitler in your disgust of Capitalism, so I can assume you are a NAZI!
"I attended some of the bourgeois[capitalist] meetings. Invariably, I had the same feeling towards these as towards the compulsory dose of castor oil in my boyhood days." -A.Hitler
6029 2018-09-21 18:19:00 Put some tea tree oil on it twice a day and exfoliate it
6030 2018-09-21 18:18:58 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
6031 2018-09-21 18:18:43 i’m getting my first oil change and i’m alone, i’m so grown...
6032 2018-09-21 18:18:43 Have it serviced... Probably 10 years since it's had an oil and filter change
6033 2018-09-21 18:18:35 Their venom cock smeared in whale oil (from a lamp) slid into their itchy snatch
6034 2018-09-21 18:18:28 If you want that support the Yemeni president and the government have left their authority from Aden and expelled the UAE from robbing ports and airports and enabling us to excavate the oil lake in northern Yemen which was previously frozen by America to satisfy Saudi Arabia.
6035 2018-09-21 18:18:23 They are colluding with Dems to make things rough for voters just before mid-terms. This is why you should avoid war in ME because oil prices skyrocket every time it happens. That’s bad for America and you.
6036 2018-09-21 18:18:16 German IC is working w Merkel & Putin on Nord Stream, putting Germany in #PutinsPocket for Oil!

German Govt isn’t paying their fair share of NATO but wants US citizens, half who voted for Trump, to have their backs!

Holding Intel puts World at risk. Hayden should denounce!
6037 2018-09-21 18:17:59 Venezuelans are starving because there’s a Dictatorship led in the past by Hugo Chavez and now by Maduro both criminals and involved in drug trafficking, nothing have to do with USA, which is the only country that pays oil on time
6038 2018-09-21 18:17:36 Do you mean mr president that ISIS will attack these countries soonly,if they save oil prices?!
its the true..and thank you...
6039 2018-09-21 18:17:22 Chef Gusteau cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with hot sauce.
6040 2018-09-21 18:17:13 Oil change kid: what's the date?

Me: 21st

Him: what "month number?"

[Feeling pretty solid about the quality of service I just paid for]
6041 2018-09-21 18:17:06 I put coconut oil in my arm pits
6042 2018-09-21 18:16:54 Oh, this is rich! Your plan is to auction public lands & cover them with oil-gas-coal and cows! You are "hating" public lands & parks to death! Your solution--allow more oil-gas-coal exploit. of public lands & oceans & use those funds to "support" parks!
6043 2018-09-21 18:16:53 But really yummy motor oil.
6044 2018-09-21 18:16:50 
6045 2018-09-21 18:16:41 Cleaned out my car.
Got an oil change.
Got my filters changed.
Paid my current bills.
Paid my future bills.

Aka: Today was pay day.
6046 2018-09-21 18:16:31 ppl in my DMs like DO NOT drink that castor oil then it’s ppl like I had my baby hours later after they drunk it.
6047 2018-09-21 18:16:30 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
6048 2018-09-21 18:16:29 Georgie responded very well to CBD even when we stopped using it he was still chilled out. If you go with CBD I’d recommend getting it off the Internet from a reputable vendor because most of the stuff in stores is snake oil. Also walking him an hour before bed helped.
6049 2018-09-21 18:16:25 My bffs mom rubbed some cbd oil loition on my head n neck but I haven’t tried it another form. But I’ve tried essential oils, ibuprofen, excedrin migraine, aspirin, naproxen, Tylenol 325s.. pretty much everything plus scripts lol and nothing has worked
6050 2018-09-21 18:16:15 Stop. That stuff can't be good on anything. It looks like motor oil with castor oil. 
6051 2018-09-21 18:16:08 I almost said oil... nd the comments proved kutsi ppl r schooled
6052 2018-09-21 18:16:06 why dont you tell me over wing kink oil

6055 2018-09-21 18:15:57 Ha ha, as more and more cars become electric as well as more combustible engines being replaced by electric ones your commodity will become less and less valuable in the world. Then what will you have to export....sand? Besides, the USA has much more oil than you think
6056 2018-09-21 18:15:52 Tea Tree Oil works amazing.. mix it with some water and use it on your face daily clears acne right up 
6057 2018-09-21 18:15:51 I just watched the 'Two Wheel Drive' episode where you guys ran a truck on two wheels.  Question:  Anyone comment about oil starvation/engine damage when running the truck tilted up like that?  Wet sump/dry sump?  Thanks.  Love the show! 
6058 2018-09-21 18:15:48 Seriously, tho, you can forget the pony.
6059 2018-09-21 18:15:37 Oh, and whatever happened to the dangers of federal overreach? Everyone in the WORLD wants a low CARBON FUTURE. Renewable power means energy security--no wars for oil, and a more secure, stable future for our children. 2/
6060 2018-09-21 18:15:33 On this day September 21, 1902 Rocky Mountain Development Company strikes oil at 1,020 feet in the Waterton Lakes; the First oil find in Alberta. #OilCity #Alberta #Waterton #CanadianHistory
6061 2018-09-21 18:15:29 We paid for your Olympics, Crossrail, the M25, Buckingham Palace upgrade, fixing Westminster, you charge us for supplying your electricity, charge us more for delivery charges, class whisky exports as English, give us 8.2% of what our oil makes, and disrespect our MPs. So sorry.
6062 2018-09-21 18:15:12 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
6063 2018-09-21 18:15:10 So Dan, climate change is not real? Should do wonders for your credibility. Please continue to tell me how extracting  & burning 34 billion barrels of oil per year from the earth has no warming effects on climate & no effect on seismic activity.
6064 2018-09-21 18:15:10 Is broiled bacon an omega 3 fish oil?
6065 2018-09-21 18:15:09 Getting my oil changed and House Hunters International is playing in the waiting room. I'm already so annoyed about how complain-y people are.
6066 2018-09-21 18:14:57 @Cathy_McLeod I take your point on the 6 000 products that are oil based.
Suppose we move as fast as we can to using oil only for products that are not burned into our air.
6067 2018-09-21 18:14:47 Cadmium oil paint is so worth it, honestly they can put down their money or shut it lmao.

I just hope they aren't like me and user their bare hands with it.
6068 2018-09-21 18:14:42 Why will they not lower the prices of petroleum products to loot them from both sides: to get their oil on lower prices and sell them your weapons on much higher prices; Mr. Trump?
6069 2018-09-21 18:14:41 Send him to a trade union He'll start making money his first day & he'll end up making as much or more than he would after college He'll also work with real men

6071 2018-09-21 18:14:17 Need an oil change and need to make my nail appointment on a day off this week coming
6072 2018-09-21 18:13:45 drinking oil is bad
6073 2018-09-21 18:13:40 that drake and future shit was oil, what he talking about?
6074 2018-09-21 18:13:40 Yeah and healthier than olive oil (extra virgin)...
6075 2018-09-21 18:13:35 Tongan oil was popping at the Rio Olympics. I posted the 1 Tongan Coconut Oil company I had in my luggage (Kakala), bc u know, I support Tongan entrepreneurs.
When I asked a fellow prolific Tongan athlete why he hadn’t shared any companies on his social, wanna know his response?
6076 2018-09-21 18:13:34 Wet lettuce coming. Red wine vinegar and olive oil at the ready
6077 2018-09-21 18:13:32 Ah, that impolite stupid way of putting pressure on "OPEC" to lower prices, this oil is a precious, expensive resource, not to be wasted by stupid people.
6078 2018-09-21 18:13:30 I sell organic oil nd black soap very affordable.pls RT nd patronise thanks.
6079 2018-09-21 18:13:27 Oh my God it is not my fault that pure cadmium oil paint costs so much. It’s not my fault! Get some other paint!!!!!!!!! I don’t control the prices of the pigments!
6080 2018-09-21 18:13:20 Its CBD oil anyway not weed

6082 2018-09-21 18:13:02 @VP The Iranian regime is heavily scared of the oil boycott, since it is mostly in terms of oil money. Forty years has passed and has not done any good work for our country, just looting, looting, looting. What government does this in the world against its people?

6093 2018-09-21 18:11:04 Just an FYI there is mustard in mayo. Haha. Have you ever made mayo from scratch?! Eggs, mustard, oil, white wine vinegar, salt. Haha
6094 2018-09-21 18:10:33 Good grief! Try more subtle lingo, like me. E.g. f*ckmuppets, tossers, scallywags, imbeciles, snake oil sales people... 
6095 2018-09-21 18:10:12 @stephenasmith @EllenburNicky  with all due respect you both are wrong about Bama. Isn't that your favorite color team in college. Not so fast Stephen bama's schedule is so easy it is sweet of sweating Crisco oil. Yes I said it.

6099 2018-09-21 18:09:34 I personally think that Trump feels he needs to follow thru & complete the mission by getting rid of, once & for all, the 11,980 isis militants, after which time he will bring our troops home. I do not think he would challenge Russia in Syria. We don't need oil or even the banks.
6100 2018-09-21 18:09:29 As long as brown people have oil and pray differently, but more so, as long as money = speech. The return on investment for military industrial complex massive companies is as strong as the pipeline from General Officer to board member.
6101 2018-09-21 18:09:25 I was Big Texas, the snake oil salesman.
6102 2018-09-21 18:09:25 Shills like Dr. Oz asking Roseanne to feel remorse and atone for their fabrications of her tweet... asking her to atone for the very sins they commit AS they are in the process of committing them.   It is so very wrong on so very many levels. #MKUltra snake oil salesmen.
6103 2018-09-21 18:09:24 If I wear a zebra costume can I get nominated for a 'top 100 animals in the oil industry' award?
6104 2018-09-21 18:08:56 Looks like I'll be getting my oil changed after work rather than tomorrow morning.
6105 2018-09-21 18:08:54 Dude literally. I had a Honda and didn’t change the oil for 10k miles and still never broke down on me. She had to have DOGGED it

6108 2018-09-21 18:08:36 On 8 September, Sir Robert Heath found Ambrose guilty and sentenced him to be executed. Two days later, he was taken from Lancaster Castle, drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, hanged, dismembered, quartered, and boiled in oil. His head was afterwards exposed on a pike.

6111 2018-09-21 18:08:13 Even so still a massive shortfall. Co’s like Honda employ in the tens of thousand. With stranglehold oil has on society, Dyson will find its growth impeded.
6112 2018-09-21 18:08:07 Why does the DEA claim that the most powerful, safe and useful medicine in the world has no medical effects? @realDonaldTrump It is time to tell the truth. I know admitting "Cannabis oil is The Panacea that cures all diseases" will destroy the entire pharma industry, that's good!

6117 2018-09-21 18:07:34 One afternoon driving around looking for an unknown address, interviewing unknown people who may have been at a party 36 yrs ago on an unknown day at an unknown location given by an unknown person should be enough. Deliberately vague on detail for a reason.
6118 2018-09-21 18:07:26 Bitumen is not oil and it can be safely shipped by rail. It needs to be phased out but in the meantime, we can stop trying to expand it and each of us can stop using it.
6119 2018-09-21 18:07:12 Every1 should change their own oil it’s not hard
6120 2018-09-21 18:07:08 If you want that support the Yemeni president and the government have left their authority from Aden and expelled the UAE from robbing ports and airports and enabling us to excavate the oil lake in northern Yemen which was previously frozen by America to satisfy Saudi Arabia.
6121 2018-09-21 18:06:55 Got my oil changed & tires rotated. Returned my library books. AND dropped off my clothing donations to the Food Bank.

6126 2018-09-21 18:05:59 NYT needs to be transparent about their sources for this Rosenstein article. They are playing with fire next to an oil field.
6127 2018-09-21 18:05:57 Now I need an oil change

6131 2018-09-21 18:05:21 One thing that annoys me about child prodigies with string instruments, especially the violin, is that they don’t know as much about bow usage and technique. Sure you can play fast and well, but a machine without oil performs significantly less to standard.

6140 2018-09-21 18:04:23 I see no "honey" or "Olive oil" bottles in the party picture with Fawad Chaudhary, Miftah Ismail & Maiza Hameed et al.
To speculate based on the color of the drink etc. would amount to claiming an expertise in something with which I have no familarity whatsoever
6141 2018-09-21 18:04:18 Why should the US depend on oil? We can use renewable energy for all of our energy needs. The conversion is happening while you live in the old world. We have the technology. We are building out the infrastructure and products. The future is available now. Buy it
6142 2018-09-21 18:04:05 thank you for putting oil in a pan to cook sausages
6143 2018-09-21 18:04:05 Why jobs from Houston keep calling me? I ain’t trying work in the oil industry.

6155 2018-09-21 18:01:52 Absolute nonsenses! Lack of capital investment, maintenance and plain ignorance is the indisputable cause. Major declines in oil production started long before sanctions . This excuse is about the only thing they learned from their Cuban puppet masters.
6156 2018-09-21 18:01:50 Well, I do lot's of days with out oil, I drive an electric car.  It's pretty sad that we have to have oil, don't you think???  It is a sunset industry, and it has to be that way; but is usable to springboard us into planet friendly energy and industry
6157 2018-09-21 18:01:49 I really liked that on at least 4 of the Oil goals the TV guys were in the middle of a long pep talk about the Jets and then “oh! scores...” I know it was a Wpg crew and I’m fine with some home team enthusiasm but hey, guys...watch the action too 
6158 2018-09-21 18:01:39 Whoaaaaaaa we're halfway there
Whoa-ohhh oil change and a spaaare
6159 2018-09-21 18:01:28 The discount rate has a bigger real world impact on the U.S. economy than modest moves in oil prices.  Given that markets expect a quarter point hike next week one wonders if the expected move draws a pre Powell press conference Presidential Tweet.
6160 2018-09-21 18:01:26 No more oil no more gas no more capitalism = no more war

6183 2018-09-21 17:58:32 Sometimes the toys are obvious....like oil. Sometimes the toys are more subtle....like religious beliefs.

6192 2018-09-21 17:57:37 Hopefully they redo the oil too in trades

6196 2018-09-21 17:57:07 Rosie O'Donnell once described Donald Trump as a snake oil salesman. However it's Obama that duped a whole nation into falling for his slick & catchy speeches & promises - All of which turned out to be BS lies. I would personally call him the biggest fraud in the USA's history.

6209 2018-09-21 17:54:32 Yes, they carpet bombed the entire country to get that pesky Bin Laden. No interest in oil pipelines or strategic geographical advantage whatsoever. Plus, the Afghan heroin trade doubled with Uncle Sam keeping an eye on the poppy fields. Always a sunny side, eh?

6219 2018-09-21 17:52:52 Quick question to anyone who’ll read this. Is it weird to ask front desk for cooking oil, ketchup and peanut butter and jelly if you have a kitchen in your room?
6220 2018-09-21 17:52:41 President Yoweri Museveni  said all major decisions have been made to facilitate oil production @bazzukulu

6222 2018-09-21 17:52:40 Should probably build pipelines to get the oil off the rail...
6223 2018-09-21 17:52:34 Shaun with all do respect that’s an ignorant thing to say. Canada’s oil and gas is the most tightly regulated in the world. Considered the QOL fossil fuels brings to people globally, Canada should be considered a beacon of ethics.
6224 2018-09-21 17:52:26 At the moment, I'm taking a stack of carnosine, pynogenol, krill oil and alcarla. It's done wonders for my sudoku but the alcarla makes my legs dead itchy.

6230 2018-09-21 17:51:22 I wouldn’t exclude middle Eastern oil money just because of the nfl thing. Not saying America wouldn’t be > interested because of nfl, but the nfl thing is about generating cash. That’s universal.
6231 2018-09-21 17:51:21 When I was campaigning for Harvey Gantt back when, republican guy told me we didn’t need an EPA because if Standard Oil ruins your water you can just sue them. What about kids who get sick & die? “Their parents can sue them, too.” What if it’s your own kids? “That shit don’t
6232 2018-09-21 17:51:12 Food has higher inflation than oil; dollar to peso rate affects oil price too; mass transit lowers oil demand but not enough
6233 2018-09-21 17:50:52 @gregorytcarlock Green New Deal report is smart and good, kudos. One aspect I'd love to see you expand on is role of financial regulation (big part of the first New Deal) in a Green New Deal. No oil company was built without a bank behind them

6236 2018-09-21 17:50:22 Good news of the day: US oil giants Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum join Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), recognizing the need for climate action and investing in low-carbon and carbon removal technologies. OGCI now covers 30% of global oil & gas supply.
6237 2018-09-21 17:50:15 Mayo is mostly oil, though. Jus a little vinegar and egg. I think it's the emulsive properties, but whatever it is, damn son.
6238 2018-09-21 17:50:14 @MDLZ Why do you use palm oil in your Fontaneda cookies? Thx.
6239 2018-09-21 17:50:04 Ultimately, the oilsands must be shut down. But as long as there's a way to move the oil (rail), it ain't shutting down. It'll only increase production. So...we're fucked?

6242 2018-09-21 17:49:58 These ones live on public lands in the U.S. Private interests such as ranching, mining, and oil want to buy lease the land. The government has no interest in managing the horses, so they are rounding up as many as they can and putting them in holding or funneling to slaughter.

6244 2018-09-21 17:49:48 Last winter was a great boon to my art skills. I fell in love with oil painting and I greatly improved with digital painting. This winter though, I’m damn well going to master digital painting. That is both a threat and a promise!

6249 2018-09-21 17:48:56 Today I'm learning about oil pipelines. Thought: if the Trans Mtn. expansion does NOT go ahead, the oil will still be produced. It'll just go south and east by rail. So, killing TMX would help protect whales, but not the environment overall.
6250 2018-09-21 17:48:55 So what? So what if he supports the left? The right has PLENTY of people helping them, including our enemies. Unlike Soros, right wingers want to take us back 100 years to the days of the oil barons when people worked 15 hour days  w/ no benefits, no HC, dirty rivers & dirty air.

6253 2018-09-21 17:48:37 You can buy some or you can make your own with a tbsp of coconut oil, 2 tbsp of brown sugar and a tbsp of honey. (Or just honey and sugar) massage it into your lips and let it sit for 10 mins then wash it off with warm water. Also, when you brush your teeth, brush your lips too
6254 2018-09-21 17:48:36 is it oil.

6258 2018-09-21 17:47:57 Can anyone explain why so many companies use palm oil? It’s not like vegetable oil/rape oil is expensive and I can’t imagine it’s any difference in taste.

6277 2018-09-21 17:46:17 Did they do some good? Sure. Local production of oil was a boon. But the fortune was made through predatory practices, vertical monopolies, and exploitation. Standard Oil was one of the most abusive companies out there. His philanthropy doesn't reverse that.

6286 2018-09-21 17:45:30 I had migraines pretty severe when I was in my 30's,  my job was very stressful,  changed jobs they went away. I hope yours get better. Eucalyptus oil is strong smelling,  but a little on the temples may help. I'm there with ya on 3 days of no sleep.

6313 2018-09-21 17:43:23 Klares guide to having the softest skin since I was 14: 
-after your done with your shower and your body is still a little wet, use body oil instead of lotion at least twice a week
-Always use baby lotion instead of regular lotion
-100% ALOE VERA GEL on any area u shave

Trust me

the project will cost around 200 billion dollar, but I think it worth it, because we will reach the point of not just exporting energy as an oil, we will also export it as a solar energy too.

6352 2018-09-21 17:39:22 We also need strict rules for rich chinese, russian oligarchs and oil sheikhs  buying up residential property in Central London and elsewhere.
6353 2018-09-21 17:39:18 If you want a #vegan #glutenfree Terry's Rum and Raisin Tray Bake, use light olive oil for butter and an extra spoonful of apple sauce for each egg. The result igorgeous (I used coconut yoghurt for the ganache but it is just too rich for the cake and I left it off). #GBBO
6354 2018-09-21 17:39:15 How if castor oil yona don't work?

6356 2018-09-21 17:39:11 stumbled upon this randomly. would this be your recommendation for vegan-friendly chips in margate? not cooked in animal fat or in the same oil as fish/meat?

6359 2018-09-21 17:38:24 Contrary to popular belief, big oil are big fans of renewables as the subsidies make them very profitable.  I'm sure they'll move into hydrogen with enthusiasm to gather up any subsidies on offer there and also provide long term sales.  They are well placed to adopt hydrogen.
6360 2018-09-21 17:38:15 Once the plant is built, it will require minimal staffing and produce no direct benefit to the community. If NG prices creep back to more than $7/mmcf, activity will grind to a halt. Good thing the oil and gas campaign to kill other energy sources worked so well...yawn...#fail
6361 2018-09-21 17:38:11 I like your sentiment but you have zero power over OPEC. We are allied with these OPEC countries because we have to keep the oil flowing in our direction. Put your money into alternative energy sources instead of a useless border wall. Then the prices will have to come down.
6362 2018-09-21 17:38:10 Ingesting coconut oil can do wonders for reversing dementia
6363 2018-09-21 17:38:06 Forgot that having a foreign car means they gauge the fuck out of you with the synthetic oil and shit.

6368 2018-09-21 17:37:30 Pushing oil through a steel shaft does not impact the “climate”.  It does allow us to ship the resource to world markets and get full value to pay for our education and health systems (and your salary).
6369 2018-09-21 17:37:22 No, pls I need swallow
6370 2018-09-21 17:37:16 Quebecois have NO idea we are getting our oil from KSA. NO IDEA!!!!!

6374 2018-09-21 17:36:55 Cute that you numbskulls think this is about Assad and ISIS.

The CIA has been planning this offensive since the mid 1980s. They published their gameplan on their own official government website. There are only two drivers here. Oil money and regional control.
6375 2018-09-21 17:36:46 Why does getting your oil changed always take like 2 while freaking hours? This is ridiculous
6376 2018-09-21 17:36:38 your oil should be atleast 100 degrees before you start driving & 30 seconds fasho aint enough on a cold morning trust me lol

6411 2018-09-21 17:31:35 Will do! I found a lot of websites with long lists of CBD oil companies and I did find some people endorsing specific brands, but few side by side comparisons from actual consumers. Figured I would spend my own time and money to evaluate a few. I’ll be sure to let you know!

And if they aren't safe without you, I bet your interest in their oil couldn't have been a safe placement. Pull out! They've got oil, others will

6441 2018-09-21 17:28:10 Our response to Insultzburg?  Next time the EU  trouble we turn our back on them.  Perhaps sanctions on Russia with US cooperation would be a start.  The Republicans would have to show their true colours and Russia could retaliate by cutting oil supply to EU.

6491 2018-09-21 17:23:16 Both my parents are pharmacists. They have never ever given me castor oil or advised me to detox. Always asked "are u drinking enough water" whenever I felt sick.

Money is everything 
That's the reason.

So the oil revenue and independent revenue figures don't matter abi?
6494 2018-09-21 17:22:21 People need to wake up and smell the coffee,just like these Fake environmental companies that laced the pockets of the Dems to have the Dem presidency use his  overreach to cap all our oil and gas Wells in the USA claiming to save polarbears
6495 2018-09-21 17:22:15 Does Bruce Jenner use both his and her towels?
6496 2018-09-21 17:22:08 It’s kinda the same concept as oil and water not mixing. Only this time it’s two bodies of water from two different places not mixing. The salinity (amount of salt) and everything else about each side (like the temp.) is too different for the water to mix
6497 2018-09-21 17:22:08 Jobs and eliminating terrorist dependency on oil?
6498 2018-09-21 17:22:07 It's September and I've only sprayed my good perfumes twice this year. Shalla to Michelle's perfumes mehn and Ngodoo and Shetty's oil perfumes. Perfume economics, spray other people's own

2cups of plain flour, 2 tbsp oil, 1/2 cup salt, 2tbsp cream of tartar, 1 to 1 1/2 cups of boiling water, food colour. Mix all together except the water then starting with a spoon add the water then as soon as you can get your hands in, kneed it till smooth.
6501 2018-09-21 17:21:31 Hella obsessed with coconut oil

6503 2018-09-21 17:21:22 That’s the old Oil check move
6504 2018-09-21 17:21:17 soap to mouth ... but, the sentiment is 100% right on.  Nothing in the world is as bad for the USA as is the Republican Party, and the Republican Party with Trump is like an oil spill with pig manure added.
6505 2018-09-21 17:20:59 I’m sorry but within the first sentence all I get is the sound of Charlie Browns teacher talking.
6506 2018-09-21 17:20:56 China+Russia cry over Pres Trump's crippling tariffs+sanctions+oil dominance after Democrats give them our intellectual property+manufacturing job+nuclear Uranium+control over global oil markets.

6509 2018-09-21 17:20:28 So why do you support buying foreign oil from countries that do not share your point of view?
6510 2018-09-21 17:20:24 Oil change? Time to read.
6511 2018-09-21 17:20:21 You definitely never put tea tree oil directly on bare skin
6512 2018-09-21 17:19:58 Commendable, I think the non-oil revenue target should be raised since we could realise about 67% of the target which is higher than the 52% realised from oil revenue. To grow Nigeria,  we need to diversify.
6513 2018-09-21 17:19:57 So, let's talk.  Take the cherry tomatoes, put then in a bowl, wash your hands, squeeze the tomatoes, add some olive oil, salt and a bit of lemon.  Meanwhile cook the pasta, add to squeezed tomatoes and add some fresh basil, parsley to finish off.
6514 2018-09-21 17:19:57 What sucks this isn’t even in my truck mine is getting oil changed etc lol. Just a regular truck.
6515 2018-09-21 17:19:50 1. Hi Ayokunle, that’s a good question but you can’t use custom figures for Non Oil Revenue only because Customs charges Duties and Levies on Import and Export products. Customs generated for both Oil and Non Oil.
6516 2018-09-21 17:19:44 I tried Ethiopian food for the first time today and almost got a stroke. Folks gotta chill with the oil.

6527 2018-09-21 17:18:58 I walked into Firestone saying I have an oil change instead of I have an appointment for an oil change. Someone come get me.
6528 2018-09-21 17:18:56 Well, the problems are twofold. 

1. I'm learning media that are forgiving, like oil and acrylic. 

2. If you calculate impulsivity, and give yourself time to step away, the impulsivity might very well end up calculated. And calculated impulsivity is hell.

The gap between revenue shortfall and our debt profile is too wide.

6560 2018-09-21 17:15:28 All that good oil... just gone to waste. And I just got it like two days ago

6620 2018-09-21 17:09:42 The price of oil is where they really got inventive. Shale should have stopped it dead.

6631 2018-09-21 17:08:58 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
6632 2018-09-21 17:08:58 I put a fork through an oil drum on my work experience when I was 15.
6633 2018-09-21 17:08:49 Or misguided...maybe she needs some eye drop viagra oil ...so she can look hard.. for #HardBrexit 
6634 2018-09-21 17:08:46 There was a steep global downturn in investment in energy after the mid-2014 oil price drop. It's recovering now but is still somewhat tepid. The chief of OPEC noted a few days ago that the investment loss was $1T. The Conservatives tend to fixate on oil and gas.
6635 2018-09-21 17:08:43 Iron Bacteria. Not an oil slick.  You are #FakeNews
6636 2018-09-21 17:08:39 Hahahahahaha. Hillary, for you, selling snake oil would be an upgrade. No one but you could have delivered America to Trump.

6640 2018-09-21 17:08:13 I put oil on my face as a moisturizer at night!!! It really helps my face not be oily. I also use this thing called pixi glow tonic and it exfoliates your skin and you don’t have to scrub it

6644 2018-09-21 17:07:48 Woke up with extreme pain again. Had a fiber and antioxidant rich breakfast, drank some white willow bark tea, did some breathing exercises, and rubbed some cbd oil on me and now I feel like I can leave the house and have a productive ass day. 
6645 2018-09-21 17:07:27 @FoxBusiness 
As I'm sitting here watching FB seeing oil prices skyrocket, you need to change the arrows. For oil and gas the green going up should be green going down. Red going down should be red going up. Higher oil and gas benefit noone.
6646 2018-09-21 17:07:17 What if I just used a drawer as my oil painting pallet
6647 2018-09-21 17:07:14 I have no personal need/desire to partake but... perhaps Oct. 17 will help reintroduce some fun and optimism in Oil Country!

6654 2018-09-21 17:06:11 @cronsell These are the birthpangs of the end of a very bad time. Try to hold on. I believe you. It does not matter what had people say. They are consumed with evil...it covers them and when their souls see light, it feels like they are frying in boiling oil, because they are.

6658 2018-09-21 17:05:13 You had to be living in Vzla since 2000 so you realize that this sanctions are not related to what you mention.  I invite you to Vzla, an oil country BTW, to get gas for your car without be a member of their government party.

6672 2018-09-21 17:03:19 So true.. market correction was long overdue & it just looks for a reason to correct be it high crude oil prices, trade war fears, dollar/rupee or today’s correction
6673 2018-09-21 17:03:15 Makes me think of the Church of PetrOleum from MaddAddam

"My friends, as we all know, 'oleum' is the Latin word for oil. And indeed, oil is holy throughout the Bible! What else is used for the anointing of priests and prophets and kings? Oil!"

6676 2018-09-21 17:03:03 Why would an outdoor oil heating boiler suddenly turn itself off? Damn thing wasn't working, took 6 attempts to get into the boiler house, pressure not rising, so hit a button, hey presto, working. WTF.

6678 2018-09-21 17:02:52 Totally agree 100  percent. All politicians, from the top down, need gone. We need big corps and lobbyists out of the political game! Including the NRA and big pharma and oil companies! None of them have our best interests In mind
6679 2018-09-21 17:02:42 Judging from some of the flavors they've come up with, I'm waiting on "Ham and Oil" or "Wet Cigarette" flavored Oreos. God knows some of them have tasted like that already.

6683 2018-09-21 17:02:13 What was the reason for the very poor performance of the oil revenue. 52.8% for the year under review to me is very low for a country that solely depend on oil. 

@BudgITng it will be nice if we can have 2016 reports side by side to juxtapose the true performance
6684 2018-09-21 17:02:11 Back where we were then, says the Sturgeon. Indyref2 anybody? Is that before or after the apology for the fiddled oil income?

6687 2018-09-21 17:01:35 Which was a revolution against the Shah that the USA instilled because Iran stopped selling oil.  Seriously if you don't know this then I'd suggest reading on the topic.

6689 2018-09-21 17:01:23 Way to much power in the hands of so few. Tech giants must be regulated for the good of mankind. They dwarf Standard Oil & the ATT of old which were reigned in under antitrust laws. Paging Jeff Sessions, come in please.

6772 2018-09-23 23:49:42 With looted funds, they used in building empty estates in Abuja and sand filling exotic island in Lagos. We produced nothing except crude oil that is drilled and exported by foreign companies. What a shame when import common rice and toothpick.

6785 2018-09-23 23:48:07 We also like to roast our mushrooms (specifically shiitake) with a wee bit of olive oil, garlic powder, and salt. It’s like little mushroom fries!! (My son will eat a whole pint!) 
6786 2018-09-23 23:48:07 There’s no real justification for keeping Jason Garrett around in Dallas but I’m sure the crotchety old oil rig crypt keeper will keep him around.

6808 2018-09-23 23:44:31 A glimpse into the absurdity that is me. I just trimmed so much fat off the bacon that it wouldn't cook properly. I had to add oil. I had to add oil to the bacon. 
6809 2018-09-23 23:44:24 Have you had any instances of customers with adverse reactions to the deodorant? Used argan oil & lavender today & it set my underarms on fire. Nearly 12 hours & a shower later there are large red spots where I applied the deodorant as well as some discomfort. 
6810 2018-09-23 23:44:20 Hahaha, you were the one who originally said we need your "oil". So maybe you are the S...... one! Lol Though I have no idea which slander you were implying. You probably added to many periods trying to be slick  I'm so glad I'm not you!!!
6811 2018-09-23 23:44:16 Justin bought an oil pipeline that no one wants. (however,to be fair,  it could be because idiot Harper signed up for it and Trudeau just has to honour the agreement)

6813 2018-09-23 23:44:02 I just read a recipe that called for one 1 teaspoon oil and I actually thought “teaspoon oil”? Oh man I don’t want to go to the store. What even is that?
6814 2018-09-23 23:43:45 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
6815 2018-09-23 23:43:16 Just what we don't need. First the Russians in Cuba and now the Navy of China comes to Venezuela. China has been buying their oil from Venezuela for several years. Will they now set up a naval base? Bernie Sanders, Liz Warren, Barry Obama and so many others must be elated today.
6816 2018-09-23 23:43:12 I’m using argon oil in my hair for the first time but I feel like it’s just going to make my hair look greasy

6831 2018-09-23 23:39:58 In the name of "private property," the IT moguls are exercising their monopoly power in the marketplace of ideas to censor political speech. Breaking them up is more problematic to the government's proper role in policing free markets than breaking up Ma Bell or Standard Oil was.
6832 2018-09-23 23:39:50 Honestly I use coconut oil after I wash my face and I rub it all over my body to moisturize after a shower. I personally don’t use it in my hair because it makes my hair heavy and oilier quicker, instead I use neem oil or Pureology 21 Essential Benefits : Colour Fanatic

6852 2018-09-23 23:35:48 We saw this coming decades ago, but elected oil executives - the Bushes, Cheney, Baker etc into offices dictating national policy.  Other nations mitigated Big Oil abuse by nationalizing the industry as the public utility it is, in actuality.  Rid ourselves of Trump, then Big Oil

6899 2018-09-23 23:28:10 Democrats and pro illegal immigration Republicans are complicit. The flow of migrants to the U.S border provides hundreds of millions of dollars to these cartels giving them funds to terrorize a defenseless Mexican population.

6911 2018-09-23 23:25:11 And here's the Bears poised for the -6, miracle-style cover. I hope ARI's entire roster is raped, tortured and drowned in motor oil by BTK's next of kin.

6913 2018-09-23 23:25:02 I’m all up for BETO! 
Just don’t mess with Oil & Gas 
6914 2018-09-23 23:25:01 I'm gonna assume the "they" you're referring to is the oil and gas industry. Auto makers (who also make the engines) are engineering and producing EVs to market demand.

6938 2018-09-23 23:20:17 It's not too late for him to change the perception of the people who gaze at his oil portrait. He can turn this around still, but it's going to take a lot of courage.
6939 2018-09-23 23:20:12 Could retire tomorrow and live very comfortably to a good old age. Its not me this is about, it's about all those who are not financially secure who fell for the snake oil. Those same people will be first in the queue to apportion blame when it's a disaster, and rightly so
6940 2018-09-23 23:19:48 Sorry bAbe
6941 2018-09-23 23:19:29 Frankincense oil.. 
6942 2018-09-23 23:19:26 Yes. To be honest, even tho they are technically different, I tend to generalize “gas” as both because they are made from oil and pollute the earth. 
6943 2018-09-23 23:19:26 Yes that's true .... i can figth until my last breathing. I know the reason behind of oil and gas. I don't change anything without power.

7000 2018-09-23 23:09:24 Yesss! All three are great for dry sensitive skin.  Although Clean Skin Club has different types of wipes I recommend their regular wipes not the coconut oil ones if you have sensitive skin - coconut oil makes some people break out.
7001 2018-09-23 23:09:23 Apparently hashtags get oil too !!
7002 2018-09-23 23:09:22 Tbh I would start doing back stretches/ exercises. Back pain runs in my family a ton and doing those really ease the pain, my dad started vaping CBD oil and it clears any pain pretty damn quickly 
7003 2018-09-23 23:09:22 Damn!  I’m full and that sounds amazing!  
I like all of those, but avocado is my oil of choice since it has a higher smoke point and is flavor neutral.

7007 2018-09-23 23:07:55 We both know that it makes no difference to the environment. Just +$ for foreign oil producers and -$ for Canadian tax revenues.
7008 2018-09-23 23:07:45 Thank you  I’ve tried that, wrecked my nail varnish  I have coconut oil on the leather now.
7009 2018-09-23 23:07:21 What is with everybody shipping out oil when we could use it for our own space program.

7045 2018-09-23 22:59:07 A chef showed me this trick. Pickup some olive oil in a spray can. Seal the top evenly. I typically add spices to mine like Cajun & also like it plain. Add oil and montreal steak ssng 2 veggies. Oven 2 400 degrees 17-18 min for decent size fillet. Stuff mushrooms w/garlic & bttr
7046 2018-09-23 22:58:59 Still means we have to take the car in. I tried refueling and putting more oil in. Then taking it for a drive. Still on.

7053 2018-09-23 22:57:35 This crap is mainly meant to manipulate the oil markets, IMO. Putin and the Sauds would LOVE higher oil prices.

7055 2018-09-23 22:57:12 Interesting how moon cakes nowadays rack up to $10 a piece.
Because traditionally, made of oil, flour, and sugar, this “delicacy” was all that people in China could afford to eat during the rare celebration.

7071 2018-09-23 22:53:49 The oil embargo resulted in an increase of oil price that tripled in less than 10 years, and a change in balance of power and world economy, including a significant stagflation in US. How to regain control over oil and fight back economic effects?

7082 2018-09-23 22:50:35 It’s also about keeping an alkaline balance to your diet. 80% alkaline foods (fruits/veggies/almonds etc) and 20% acid (meats/eggs/fish)
Fats like olive oil are usually considered neutral pH.

7095 2018-09-23 22:48:22 That is true.
It helps to understand why that war started and who benefited. Going back seven years. There was an oil embargo in 73. That embargo was enforced by Faisal of Saudi with cooperation by shah of Iran and. Arab and other open members.
7096 2018-09-23 22:48:14 Black tea with honey and lemon. Not too much honey in case it's a bacterial infection. Oil of oregano tastes awful but will work very quickly. I get laryngitis frequently and that's my 2 helps.
7097 2018-09-23 22:48:07 あー、似合いますねそれ！
7098 2018-09-23 22:47:32 I'm glad it did... You will feel the difference between the oil and using water sef... Oil seals the heat in the skin which cause the peppery/burning sensation so it kinda continues the skin cooking process.... (my own analysis) which causes the blisters...
7099 2018-09-23 22:47:25 You need to do some research on varieties of oil and distribution of refineries and markets. You have some misconceptions eg where sweet crude is, eg shipping costs via pipeline or boat or rail, etc. Stretch your brain some more.
7100 2018-09-23 22:47:23 Combining all would be great. Bottom line, Dana Rohrbacher has voted to strip away healthcare and wants giant oil rigs off our pristine coastline. This choice is an easy one.

7103 2018-09-23 22:46:35 I reccomend putting a bit of olive oil and some salt in the bottom of the pan and sitting rost on  about 3 or four onion halves of onions and letting it slow cook. Also prepping the roast with a rub of your choice is big bonus points. (Brown sugar rub)
7104 2018-09-23 22:45:49 My boy  seems to be feeling pretty good! I just need to get him to eat more. 

The CBD oil seems to be helping him a good bit, along with the nightly subcutaneous fluids. So nice to see his spunk back! His kidney #s were a bit improved this week, too. 
7105 2018-09-23 22:45:46 Whip together 4 cups English muffins with 4 cups dates. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with love.
7106 2018-09-23 22:45:24 I really do believe that it is a serious dilemma. For food the supermarket supply chain is via England. And so yes I agree with you, we need to engage with Scotland's food producers. Oil and gas, power supply is within our control - I trust.
7107 2018-09-23 22:45:22 In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court found Standard Oil in violation of anti-trust laws and ordered it to dissolve. Freedom of speech is precious.

7127 2018-09-23 22:42:15 I felt relieved when I washed off the palm oil, the water helped.

I add coconut oil to it for an added boost. Would a small amount of Protein & Greens be a good or bad idea to help satiate me?

7174 2018-09-23 22:33:47 Season then with However you like. I used celery salt, garlic powder, black pepper, a lil cayenne pepper, tenderizer and a hint of paprika. Put them in flour, put a little oil in your pot, fry them until they are a little brown and add about 3-4 cups of water. Add onions !
7175 2018-09-23 22:33:44 Brown rice has high levels of arsenic(!) as well as tasting bland. Basmati and wild rice are healthier options. Cooking white rice with coconut oil, cooling it in the fridge and reheating reduces the evil carb content too

7187 2018-09-23 22:31:58 You're the ones that keep insisting we go through these processes.

Maybe take the hint, we don't want your oil company paymasters pipeline and it can't pass a proper approval. 

Its not in the national interest.
7188 2018-09-23 22:31:49 Brand new Aura Cacia Elevate Hair Care Essential Oil Blend (1x.5 FZ) is now available at our store. Hurry up! Only  are left:  .

7190 2018-09-23 22:31:25 And they stopped allowing the parents to administer the oil in hospital as had bn done on several previous occasions... saving her life.
7191 2018-09-23 22:31:15 Not only no?

But why even ask the question?

The days of military intervention to reap the spoils of war seem to be gone.

Taking their oil away from them would be the only logical reason to intervene.

It’s their bed, let them lay in it. They hate Americans, they hate you.
7192 2018-09-23 22:31:12 Okay, the only thing missing while burning this night oil is a bottle of a watermelon flavoured drink...
7193 2018-09-23 22:31:07 Government guys say our Exxon family  needs to recoup the trillions in oil assets. After 100 years, the government will release the alien’s secret free energy for mankind.
7194 2018-09-23 22:30:55 "Sh--"

Almost mimics him again. Leans into his touch. Now his hand has motor oil on it.

"Make me."
7195 2018-09-23 22:30:51 Today Saudi Arabia and Russia, in a meeting with oil producers, said that they have the capacity to increase oil production to match global supply. Saudi Arabia also insisted that they have enough to meet any shortages.
7196 2018-09-23 22:30:44 COCONUT OIL IS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN IT CLOGS YOUR PORES. THIS ISNT FOR DEBATE HOES.
7197 2018-09-23 22:30:43 Bc people bill it as some “cure all” for almost every problem and there’s just no way it’s possible that a natural oil can do as many things as it’s claimed to do. Also I’ve taken it for anxiety and it just literally did nothing at all
7198 2018-09-23 22:30:42 お疲れ様です！衣装とかどうでした？
7199 2018-09-23 22:30:42 @MikeHudema will tell you different after all he pushes for foreign oil and for the destruction of the Canadian Economy no?

7202 2018-09-23 22:30:26 I understand that. I have really bad anxiety myself... mostly social. What cured me online was political Twitter. Nothing like tossing yourself in hot oil. It's a nightmare. I hate talking politics & won't here. That isn't a cure...
7203 2018-09-23 22:30:11 changed the oil and the filters from my car today, took her to the car wash already
7204 2018-09-23 22:29:54 This slide is taken out of context... they were addressing quality issues in some of the other essential oil companies. Also in your heading you may want to change "their" to "they're"
7205 2018-09-23 22:29:46 This region was in poverty before hashish became dominant. Only olive oil was produced here and that was a desperate existence. Cannabis here may have lifted 200,000 people in the Ketama region out of poverty since 1965. There is no downside I can see. They have enough water.
7206 2018-09-23 22:29:41 料理雑誌なんて病院待ちでしか読んだことない気がする
7207 2018-09-23 22:29:33 One thing is clear, OPEC leaders have already expressed their fear of dip in demand due to high prices which could ultimately lead to collapse in prices. I hope they have a plan to keep prices sustainable for both producers and consumers #OOTT

7214 2018-09-23 22:28:15 Got the chance to go outside (my backyard) and complete an oil painting. Gave me a chance to test my setup, and try out this medium outside.  I love learning new things and am excited to continue learning this medium as well as watercolor #paintoutside #mybackyard #oilpaint

7217 2018-09-23 22:27:28 @Scottymechanic Question about the GDI engines and Oil Catch can. Does a 2014 Ford Escape Titanium with the 2.0L Ecoboost engine have the dual injector setup or just straight into the block?
7218 2018-09-23 22:27:22 Probably made with ginseng and powdered rhino horn. Or is it Spanish Fly? Could be Snake Oil actually....
7219 2018-09-23 22:27:19 It's basically a crude oil spill.
7220 2018-09-23 22:27:16 Vitamin E oil really is life, sense I stay burning myself
7221 2018-09-23 22:27:14 The oil price in the US is increasing alot.

Guys prepare to pay more for fuel next month.

7228 2018-09-23 22:26:20 The best thing about fall is that I can use oil primers and be GLOWY AF.
7229 2018-09-23 22:26:09 The cartoon guy on @JoeBuddenPod gotta do the "Oil man" video that shit would be too funny
7230 2018-09-23 22:26:05 
7231 2018-09-23 22:25:51 Definitally because veg oil would make it a little too greasy and savory flavor. Probably season them with the cinnamon and brown sugar before and then after too so it’ll lock in the flavor
7232 2018-09-23 22:25:39 I don’t think you get it, yet. Repeat this to yourself until you understand. “We have to reduce oil use to survive.”
7233 2018-09-23 22:25:37  body scrub: 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of olive oil (for softer and smoother skin)
 tomato face scrub: take 1/4 of a tomato, dip it in some sugar and gently rub your face for 3-4 mins (for improved skin texture)

7237 2018-09-23 22:24:38 Yes!! Cinnamon and brown sugar!! And maybe fry em in peanut oil?
7238 2018-09-23 22:24:28 I feel like the timing would be the same as waiting for medicine to kick in no? And I’m def not down for medicine though. Just sprayed some of her oil though. Pray for me.
7239 2018-09-23 22:24:26 I want to buy this hair oil but its $44
7240 2018-09-23 22:24:16 It's quite simple Mr Murray. The union doesn't work or listen to Scotland,  it just wants the oil revenues to set against borrowing for poor economic policies. The EU backs it's members as it's doing with Ireland.
7241 2018-09-23 22:24:11 how does the salt stick without oil or butter?
7242 2018-09-23 22:24:11 No production increase to compensate for falling inventory
7243 2018-09-23 22:23:52 it's only the oil and it does work
7244 2018-09-23 22:23:32 Idk gaskets blew and oil started spraying everywhere and caught on fire 
7245 2018-09-23 22:23:31 As a consumer I am getting concerned LoL
7246 2018-09-23 22:23:29 He can not win this trade war with China. Now he are asking OPEC for lower oil price...who the h... do he think he is? We live in a time where we can witness an empires fall. For a better world.

7248 2018-09-23 22:23:15 Not a damn one of them better vote for Trump again if, God forbid, he actually runs in 2020.  They're getting bailed out, at our expense, because too many of them fell for his snake oil pitch the first time around.
7249 2018-09-23 22:22:51 My car has alerts for an oil change, tire maintenance, my key battery is low, and my tire pressure is low Jesus take the wheel

7253 2018-09-23 22:22:42 You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflow
7254 2018-09-23 22:22:36 Remember how people said #fossilfuel #divestment would never make a difference? We are now seeing US oil & gas companies list it as a material risk. #responsibleinvestment funds are now more than half total fum in Aus - how long before Woolies feels the pinch? #gambling
7255 2018-09-23 22:22:33 Of course, OPEC just gave Trump the middle finger.
7256 2018-09-23 22:22:28 Wow naman bomba ang highlight o natural oil? Waha

7259 2018-09-23 22:21:09 I give @KySportsRadio credit,  he always says punch up.. He definitely did this time @dailymissbailey. But you do realize he can't check your oil right?
7260 2018-09-23 22:20:59 PSA: the SLC Airport smells like one giant Doterra oil. 

Use caution.
7261 2018-09-23 22:20:52 You can try peppermint oil! I only get headaches not migraines and it work wonders. My dad also said to drink a lot of water and try to sleep (doesn’t help if you have things to do lol)

7269 2018-09-23 22:20:09 Zac - how can you compare the 2??? UK is the 5th largest economy in the world. Scotland would be a banana republic relying on the price of oil! Similar to Venezuela and we all know how that has ended!
7270 2018-09-23 22:19:59  lemon face mask: juice from 1 lemon and 1/4 cup of olive oil (exfoliation and moisture)

7272 2018-09-23 22:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
7273 2018-09-23 22:19:41 I usually do tofu separately so I can get an even cook. Press out the moisture first , cube it and then sear/saute in oil, get color on one side then flip em

7283 2018-09-23 22:18:29 There are three tapestries made by Canadians that were inspired by the Bayeux. Mine is the most recent The Black Gold Tapestry about the history of oil from beginning of time to  present day.
7284 2018-09-23 22:18:26 I have a miracle oil that I am suppose to be using on my scar from my surgery, but I keep forgetting to use it... Oops

And result in lower oil prices..

Where is that?

7293 2018-09-23 22:16:48 TIL hot cooking oil + my leg = ouch.
7294 2018-09-23 22:16:45 Fact check and NBC news is Oil and Water.
7295 2018-09-23 22:16:31 It's not even oil, it's diluted bitumen and not valuable enough to risk the disaster that comes with it - pipelines leak ALL THE TIME but big oil keeps it out of the news Truly delusional
7296 2018-09-23 22:16:09 I live in the oil rich province of Alberta. We need to continue to do better, take care of our environment. We are all responsible every single one of us!

7298 2018-09-23 22:15:58 Good how about you Hagu~?
7299 2018-09-23 22:15:52 That would be oxidized vegetable oil, cooked in high temperatures making them even more carcinogenic and stored in plastic bottles in hot warehouses for an added dose of endocrine disrupter chemicals. Yum! Can't imagine why our pets are so unhealthy! #cancerepidemic

7301 2018-09-23 22:15:27 That is absolutely so true! Look at that little kid in California that gets to go to school now because of THC oil. A judge just ruled that he's allowed to attend public school with that oil. Marijuana is self has so many different cures
7302 2018-09-23 22:15:12 My *hot take* mental health crisis fixes: 
-All lights should be #SAD lamps 
-lavender oil should be diffused in all rooms

7318 2018-09-23 22:12:49 No- I roasted it in olive oil and cumin seeds and lemon wedges and cut into wedges itself- with mash and vegan sausages but I think...
7319 2018-09-23 22:12:39 1 This reveals the UCP economic strategy - boost oil as hard as possible with gov interference ie regulatory slashing so they can bring in revenue from natural resources to cover the loss from their proposed flat tax and austerity cuts. This is tone deaf to the global market
7320 2018-09-23 22:12:38 Yeah you need lots of spices, plus oil and a little sugar
7321 2018-09-23 22:12:31 The other day was sharing with the TL how my skin is currently a mess. The very generous @OyinadeBeauty

7324 2018-09-23 22:12:22 Why are you not coherent Val. You asked for 1 thing that has changed & I did well to mention just 1. Living standard is a different discussion. Check the contribution of non oil sector to government revenue, it has been rising significantly indicating diversification. This is 2

7329 2018-09-23 22:11:08 Just made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies using avocado, protein powder, and stevia. No sugar, no butter, no oil. They are actually pretty good. Need guilt free options to feed my football sorrows.
7330 2018-09-23 22:11:00 Well I make it up as I go along really. The raw beets were cut into quarters and drizzled with chilli oil, put in the oven as swiched on, bottom rung. Turned when ever opened oven a few chilli flakes added 1/2 way. Other roast veg drizzeled with honey.
7331 2018-09-23 22:10:29  I should hope so! We ran our trucks on biodiesel for one year, but that recycled oil became pretty hard to come by and at a premium, of course we didnt have millions of donors to subsidize us.

7333 2018-09-23 22:10:10 Glossier's milky jelly cleanser, lush Eau Roma Water, and The Ordinary's Rosehip Seed oil are all I ever want to touch my skin for the rest of time.

7336 2018-09-23 22:09:59 iBeen using that growth oil in the white bottle for a couple months, it works
7337 2018-09-23 22:09:51 for 3rd running @MzZeigler as he takes a hard right off the track in T2, leaving a trail of oil behind him @btownspeedway #LucasDirt #Jackson100
7338 2018-09-23 22:09:43 If you don't almost die dropping your french fries in the pot the oil ain't hot enough. #wisdom #cooking #jesustakethewheel
7339 2018-09-23 22:09:19 To think this entire film was animated with oil paint on glass still blows my god damn mind
7340 2018-09-23 22:09:17 can someone explain why oil is up? i did not find anything bullish in #JMMC. i thought positioning was largely bullish already so clearly i got this one wrong. should maybe stick to equity :l
7341 2018-09-23 22:09:15 Maybe we should've worried about the debt when we gave the wealthiest 1% and corporations huge tax cuts. Great economies is usually the time to pay down debts and raise taxes on some things. Maybe end oil subsidies?
7342 2018-09-23 22:09:10 also I just had to find nutritional yeast, jarred sundried tomatoes in oil, vegan pesto and full fat coconut milk just to make dinner. Having an allergy is hard, kids. #dairyhatesme
7343 2018-09-23 22:09:08 Could just sauté it up with garlic and oil. Shrinks up pretty well.
7344 2018-09-23 22:09:07 When we bring makdoos into our homes ARE WE NOT AWARE it is literally walnuts soaked in damn olive oil who can sustain this much calories I’m crying!
7345 2018-09-23 22:08:45 The Earth has been abused and battered and drilled. The Earth has been  under attack from oil corporations and all corporation and irresponsible  people who are only interested in making money at the expense of the environment.  The time this is NOW.
7346 2018-09-23 22:08:42 Tehy wantsto overthrow him for what I already explained to you. Venezuela could be a country like Dubai, we have oil, gold, iron, diamonds, cobalt, gas is rich in natural resources but they have not been able to direct it because everything has been stolen.
7347 2018-09-23 22:08:28 anyone good at oil painting?
7348 2018-09-23 22:08:20 I’d like to try the blemish care spot serum with hija seed oil from innisfree, and ectoplasm perfume and karma cream body lotion from lush :D I think I’m going through a phase where I actually want stuff that I can use lol
7349 2018-09-23 22:08:04 Oil and gas are known to exaggerate and just in Weld County alone, the wind industry employs way more than O&G. They’ve taken advantage of old laws & we’ve had enough. Teachers, firefighters, and even those who used to work in oil and gas & whose health is affected agree.

7352 2018-09-23 22:07:50 Oil changes, lubrication, minor tune ups, brake pads, tire pressures.
7353 2018-09-23 22:07:42 The U.S. is the number one producer of oil and China is now the number one importer of oil.  Keep devaluing the Yuan oil prices increase.  Should be interesting.
7354 2018-09-23 22:07:38 Drying them guns after washing, I guess? Here's a lifehack for the busy gunman: Soak the gun in oil and use an air compressor a few days later to clean the hard-to-reach places. You also don't have to mess with water that way.
7355 2018-09-23 22:06:45 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.
7356 2018-09-23 22:06:29 VA you need to look into CBD oil- it has been a GODSEND for me with my brusied Saciaia and pinched nerve- the pain pills that there precribed for me was Ibropren 600mg 3 times a day-I took them for over 4 months and I started taken 500mg of CBD oil and within an hour no pain

7361 2018-09-23 22:05:29 Sir, dont be so pessimistic..

Unprecented amount of public spending from agriculture to roads to MSP to airports & airoutes and not to mention implementation GST, IBC, RERA, Fugitive econ offernders bill while maintaining CAD at 3.t and repaying oil bonds..
No govt comes close!
7362 2018-09-23 22:05:16 @JasonGregor hope the station has a big bowl of crow for you to eat tomorrow. #tiger #hesback #80
7363 2018-09-23 22:05:10 I think I took two 500 mg ones, and now my headache is finally gone  Peppermint oil sounds like a good option too though, I could give it a try! I hadn't even considered that
7364 2018-09-23 22:05:05 Let’s think real hard for a second and ask ourselves why oily skin is unattractive . Like I feel as if the stigma only exists so oil blotting sheets can be sold.
7365 2018-09-23 22:04:58 I’m not Jake, but I can tell you capers with minced shallots and garlic in olive oil is incredible as a sauce over steak.
7366 2018-09-23 22:04:36 I’m not a certified aromatherapist, but in learning about the benefits of them. I stinking loveeeeeeeeee my oils and diffusers.

7371 2018-09-23 22:03:32 Those that called themselves Niger Deltans should rise up now and object this issue of using oil and gas from Southern part of Nigeria to borrow loan from China as collateral

7374 2018-09-23 22:03:13 Oh I need to get some! I used a whole thing of peppermint oil in just a couple weeks in my first trimester  also a life saver for nausea
7375 2018-09-23 22:03:06 Apple cider vinegar and coconut oil!!! Works great I’ve been using since school
7376 2018-09-23 22:02:19 not trying to be one of those road warrior douches who rev their engine  while driving local- I just got an old car and haven’t changed the oil in 6 months u feel me
7377 2018-09-23 22:02:11 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
7378 2018-09-23 22:01:54 It’s used widely as a fragrance and even body oil. I’m not sure though how much of the hydrogen cyanide it may contain can penetrate the skin or affect thr body when breathed.
7379 2018-09-23 22:01:52 Isa sa pinaka tanong ko ukol sa kasaysayan ng batas militar ay yung "bakit may pinapaborang tao o organisasyon ang kasaysayan"
7380 2018-09-23 22:01:44 I grew up blessed with praying parents. The times I’ve walked out the door with my mothers prayers over me and oil on my forehead are countless. Not everyone was blessed with that kind of upbringing, and I am more than grateful.
7381 2018-09-23 22:01:20 I went on Instagram earlier tonight and @afowler06 was only selling CBD Oil. Top picture, no lie.

7383 2018-09-23 22:01:00 You are trying to rig it though so that the single Remain option wins by trying to split the Leave vote. You are nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
7384 2018-09-23 22:00:54 King Salman has dementia. Everyone nows it. So would not ask much from him. The west has oil, weapons, and technology. You guys have oil, camels, and falconry. The plan is use all your oil and send you truly back to 8th century.
7385 2018-09-23 22:00:49 So much skincare has coconut oil but it’s so bad for the skin!!! And it’s like extra terrible for my skin cuz it’s already combination oily
7386 2018-09-23 22:00:46 I think it’s worth trying. You’ll know right away. The CBD oil my friend used had zero THC. I used oil with and without, and the actual bud too. Didn’t work for me but it was all great for her!
7387 2018-09-23 22:00:45 Settle down women’s!

7390 2018-09-23 21:59:48 The oil proceeds will help in running the varied ministerial departments in the country, not to mention, the billions and billions of dollars badly needed to import food from Uganda since our Agricultural infrastructure continues to be either neglected or it is non existent.
7391 2018-09-23 21:59:40 I use oil every other day
7392 2018-09-23 21:59:37 QOS always strikes me as dumb in this respect. Why would Greene drink the oil even if he was completely dehydrated?
7393 2018-09-23 21:59:28 yea this oil pen has me on lax mode
7394 2018-09-23 21:59:19 食べたら吐きそうだから頭痛薬飲めないんだけど
7395 2018-09-23 21:59:13 So I ran out of conditioner and coconut oil
7396 2018-09-23 21:59:12 Lindsey Graham, I think you’ve been drinking the snake oil, but then again you have always been a self serving, arrogant, opportunistic jerk. The devil is alive and well in the Republican Party.
7397 2018-09-23 21:59:03 I think you are making things up.  This has never happened. Lived here our whole lives and involved in the oil industry
7398 2018-09-23 21:58:59 One at 1g should be enough. Afterwards you'd need some rest. There's also.peppermint oil that you can apply on the forehead.

At best you can call out just to recover. It's better to rest in your bed waiting for the headache to go away for good.
7399 2018-09-23 21:58:37 Haha..I guess,since the Paris Accord is falling apart b/c it was built on Fake Science&Greed,the~rest of the world must be"run by oil companies"!The UNFCC didn't believe IPCC"Science"either b/c it excluded Nats w/~5Billion of Earth's~6.5Billion ppl from its Kyoto CO2 Strictures!
7400 2018-09-23 21:58:34 There is no doubt that the oil will start bringing in the proceeds much needed for developmental initiatives soon rather than later, but there are quite a few deficiencies here and there that we need the international community to still cater to.
7401 2018-09-23 21:58:15 Sadly they’ve shown what they care more about and it’s money over our brothers and sisters. The only reason I hope Tesla’s becoming a top seller in the automotive market is maybe oil won’t be worth a dime in the future!
7402 2018-09-23 21:58:05 Universals oh universals we exhaust the deserts and coasts we decorate oil rig isles with flowers What holy men ship us messages for our kiddies from Roche-Carre To us the water is thick with hunting blinds with space with our homes our bodies.

7405 2018-09-23 21:57:39 @GoVauxhall had to change engine oil and filter both as oil had no viscosity left and didn’t want to damage my car. Very smart thieves.
7406 2018-09-23 21:57:26 Half of Venezuela’s nationalized oil production now belongs to China
7407 2018-09-23 21:57:25 I learned how to replace headlight lamps. No way in hell I'd pay almost $300 for someone to do it. Thank God for you tube! Wish I could change oil and brake pads!
7408 2018-09-23 21:57:24 Trying to make some granola bars but it's cold enough in the house that my big jar of coconut oil has turned into a brick.
7409 2018-09-23 21:57:04 My partner got me Oud oil from morroco. Can't wait to smell the fuck out of it.
7410 2018-09-23 21:57:04 Free speech, a wonderful liberal perspective. Conservative government for 8 years...seems like maybe enough time to stop buying oil from the Saudis don’t you think?
7411 2018-09-23 21:56:59 Saudi Arabia worried about $80/bbl oil; govt estimates it can't pump much more than 11M bpd. Running low on Arab light crude for its Oct allocations on higher demand than expected
7412 2018-09-23 21:56:55 (´・ω・｀) ウッ
7413 2018-09-23 21:56:43 Well, according to your pictures, you could just check oil every 2 years!

7419 2018-09-23 21:55:38 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
7420 2018-09-23 21:55:34 when OPEC met and stated they weren't slowing down production, Canadian companies in the global oil market, realized how junior they were. But sure, blame it on regulations that the oil industry helped the NDP to create or pipelines
7421 2018-09-23 21:55:18 Pero hindi yan tama, kinokondina mo ang mali gamit ang isa pang kamalian? Yan ba ang nais mong iparating?
7422 2018-09-23 21:55:16 Conservatives are Climate Change deniers. They think there's no harm done when they drive their SUV's or that oil drilling occurs. The Earth is a fragile living being that deserves respect, we are guests on it.  Too many think the Earth can be abused anyway they see fit.

7429 2018-09-23 21:54:45 China hasn't had famines in ages, Cuba has state-controlled food prices to keep the people fed, & Venezuela is a lesson in why you shouldn't tie your state economy solely to the volatile oil market. No mention of states like Denmark, Finland, etc. WTF is this red-baiting bullshit

7445 2018-09-23 21:52:24 I know who the gringos are, but not everything that it said about them is true. When Nicolas Maduro says that the United States is behind our oil that is not true. The narco government itself has given the Cubans our oil resources, the Chinese and the Russians our Gold...

7449 2018-09-23 21:51:45 Not correct. Cats absolutely need baths if they get something on their fur that could harm them (like oil) if they have fleas, etc. I give my cats a couple of baths a year and I can tell they always feel better after.
7450 2018-09-23 21:51:35 Sound like a wonderful dinner. I saute cabbage with butter, a bit of olive oil and caraway seeds.
7451 2018-09-23 21:51:34 Remember when the Trudeau feminist& human rights government spoke out about Saudi Arabia being voted to the UN Women’s rights Commission? Remember when they said would no longer import oil from KSA? Remember when they spoke out about increased oil imports from KSA Algeria&UAE
7452 2018-09-23 21:51:28 Saudi is a vicious place. I'm surprised that they're the ones we like. Oh yeah...oil.
7453 2018-09-23 21:51:28 I’m from the USA  , with all the time I invest in watching sports why would I root for some crummy team that never puts a good product on the field or once in a lifetime gets lucky or some oil Barron buys them , life is too short and United is the equivalent of the @Yankees
7454 2018-09-23 21:51:23 We are a country that builds ourselves   But you have to beg you how to get the oil. Waiting for you to see how the ones that attacked Ahwaz are piled up like ISIS. 
7455 2018-09-23 21:51:21 The current laws, where Medical Marijuana is legal, it's way to EASY for anyone to get an Rx for medical marijuana. IT'S CRAZY.

7462 2018-09-23 21:49:49 My guess is not in the Oil and Gas industry. Easy to guess when I read that cavalier attitude about people losing their livelihoods and you refer to an article about it as an enjoyable read.

7464 2018-09-23 21:49:21 Trudeau promised @gmbutts he would sabotage every pipeline he could, my point is there is still oil there.

7474 2018-09-23 21:47:09 Opponent don’t like the way oil is mined in Canada but don’t realize/care that oil will be shipped in from other countries at a greater expense. And the fact that they aren’t willing to get off using oil and it’s by products. Not sure what to think of them.

7479 2018-09-23 21:46:34 The oilsands are being cleaned up. Once the oil is gone the area will be remediated. Much like every BC mine when it's closed out.

7535 2018-09-23 21:38:44 You're pathetic... Whilst your country starves 5 million Yemeni children to death, you want to talk about Iran?

And how much oil money is Saudi Arabia funneling to terrorists in Syria and Yemen? How much are you paying Al-Nusra and Jaysh al-Islam to carry out your dirty war?
7536 2018-09-23 21:38:26 When it's that point in my face oil god bless i'll be here all week n i have been warned.
7537 2018-09-23 21:38:24 @SecPompeo:  Iran is not the biggest exporter of terrorism, Saudi Arabia is.  But of course, the Saudis export a lot of oil to us so that's ok.

7539 2018-09-23 21:37:51 If you have damaged appliances, furniture and electronics, do not dispose of them. Do not touch or move hazardous waste, such as propane tanks, paint, gas and oil. Please contact your insurance company for  direction.

 Marinate  Chicken Thigh in 1 cup Olive Oil and  Ginger for 1 hour.

7575 2018-09-23 21:32:45 Yes. Many of these States are not ready to work for IGR because they are sharing from Oil & Gas rents.  Starve them like OBJ did Lagos and they will become creative and self-reliant like Lagos.

7614 2018-09-23 21:28:18 Big Plans tomorrow! Massage Chair, Grape Soda, and an oil change... at the same time!

7619 2018-09-23 21:27:35 Ahhh leaking oil a bit. C’mon, Tiger!
7620 2018-09-23 21:27:22 Ready to get out of this town and back to the oil field
7621 2018-09-23 21:26:30 i want to try out my new oil pastels but i dont know what to draw. Any suggestions?
7622 2018-09-23 21:26:27 But that’s not how those teams work anymore. In the past people support Roma for players like Totti and De Rossi but with oil money they would still support us for the world class players we could have. I forget that at the moment we are bringin through so many youngsters

7624 2018-09-23 21:26:21 Electricity is nice but stripping mountains of oil and polluting the earth for this luxury sucks too. Even some families that live in those mountains don't get access to it.

7629 2018-09-23 21:25:25 He followed after her, sealing off the entrance behind him. The buck heading inside only to stop to turn on an old oil lamp to provide light.

The cave was small but cozy, everything being made of a nice oak wood, money seeming to cover the oak wood couch.

7630 2018-09-23 21:25:14 Send that man to a sensitivity class. The theme of this oil painting would be betrayal
7631 2018-09-23 21:25:06 Have you tried CBD oil? It’s helped amazingly with mine!!!!
7632 2018-09-23 21:25:04 Dang! Dug deep enough to strike oil on that one!
7633 2018-09-23 21:24:46 Oh and btw we can use water to design engines that produce less emissions they just wanna keep oil in rotation because of how reckless world officials are with psychological scarring of the worlds battles from the 20s back this a whole new millenium
7634 2018-09-23 21:24:42 Tiger leaking just a little bit of oil here. #TOURChampionship
7635 2018-09-23 21:23:57 Sunday, is definitely rest day after a heroic quantity of drink and Vegan pizza with @jmhorse @Bastett and @Theo_Spaniel. I regret nothing of my decision to drink all the chilli oil!
7636 2018-09-23 21:23:43 Extra virgin olive oil. Massage it into the scalp.
7637 2018-09-23 21:23:34 With your oil & gas assets,
#Scotland has three choices now:
a) independence + #remain in the EU
b) independence + a #Norway-style deal
c) #brexit + follow England down the toilet 
    and allow a Westminster govt to squander Scotland's oil revenues
7638 2018-09-23 21:23:22 Baby oil on freshly shaven legs fuckin DO me
7639 2018-09-23 21:23:08 Be well.Spouse did that 2 years ago.They used an oil bubble to be replaced with gas at a latter date(in next few months).Thus far it's all good .Prayers.
7640 2018-09-23 21:23:05 looking at his whole career afterwards convinced me that he only cared for the political gain when opposing the war. he‘s obviously not opposed to „bloody oil“ on a personal level.
7641 2018-09-23 21:22:41 Using LibreOffice is like jumping into a refreshing lake, except instead of water it's somehow filled with canola oil
7642 2018-09-23 21:22:35 Ohhhhhhh Rosey is leakingggg oil.
7643 2018-09-23 21:22:33 My tears are olive oil.........
7644 2018-09-23 21:22:18 Rose leaking oil. Need to avoid a birdie on 17 or 18. Too bad 18 is really easy
7645 2018-09-23 21:21:52 "My tears are olive oil."
..........
Yeah....
7646 2018-09-23 21:21:46 Rosehip oil
7647 2018-09-23 21:21:42 Okay. But from where fund will come? By increasing the oil prices further? Just to gain votes government has been milking the Middle class people. This has to change.
7648 2018-09-23 21:21:25 You are ridiculous.......Skip Bayless of Oil City strikes again.....
7649 2018-09-23 21:21:04 Needs some razor wire mounted on angled  stantions off the U.S side and a couple strands of electrified wire across the top.
7650 2018-09-23 21:21:04 got a bag of cashews that made me and tzinta's mouths burn for days although neither of us is (as far as we know) allergic to nuts. Looked it up and apparently cashews are in the poison ivy family and their shells are covered in poison ivy oil.
7651 2018-09-23 21:21:00 It would be much quicker to tell the Yankees that there's a massive oil storage beneath ryleigh. Then we only have to wait that they try to teach our great lord cthulhu some lessons in freedom and democracy.
7652 2018-09-23 21:20:48 Dan told me if I smell Gas or Motor Oil in the basement to remember when the tank pumps to the drainfield I am likely to get a whiff.
7653 2018-09-23 21:20:39 It is! But we do cooperate a lot with EU and we are a part of EEA and NATO and stuff, thing is we didn’t become a part of EU earlier since we didn’t want to share our oil money I guess. Stupid anyways I think
7654 2018-09-23 21:20:38 Leaking oil
7655 2018-09-23 21:20:34 May be by the time we can't sell oil to US all of us will put our hands on deck
7656 2018-09-23 21:20:32 CBD OIL has been known to help A.D.H.D.
7657 2018-09-23 21:20:31 Of course you are getting fed from the snake oil salesman.

Because that has worked so well thus far...
7658 2018-09-23 21:20:01 Potatoes are so delicious especially roasted with olive oil
7659 2018-09-23 21:19:41 Is this true @Colgate @KITKAT @Dove and @Doritos - do you buy palm oil from companies destroying rainforests and also #Orangutang habitats too
7660 2018-09-23 21:19:37 make sure to spritz lightly w/ olive oil before you start. things like your puppies, homemade fries etc. do need a little oil to work right in the air fryer
7661 2018-09-23 21:19:29 Juventus don't have mega money, their record transfer is less than most Premier league teams, yet they win trophies and make finals. You don't need to spend hundreds of millions, if we can get the new stadium I'd take self sustained finances all day over oil money.
7662 2018-09-23 21:19:20 one of them completely unironically told me to put lemon essential oil in my water

no thanks on the $20 oily grossness, I can put an actual lemon in it and it costs me 50 cents
7663 2018-09-23 21:19:07 Put a lil coconut oil on 
7664 2018-09-23 21:18:58 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
7665 2018-09-23 21:18:55 @RachelNotley @jkenney @RickFraserYYC @RicMcIver such a cause should make those importing foreign oil reconsider!!!
7666 2018-09-23 21:18:54 Whilst they can still make money from oil they will continue to do so. who's to say a clean petrochemical alternative hasn't already been invented but being kept quiet to keep oil prices high?
7667 2018-09-23 21:18:32 Highly suggest beard oil and balms. I try to stick with local all natural stuff (burnt whiskey, splendid bastards, etc) balms are great if you're going out to keep it together and not in your drink. Oils nice after shower to keep it soft. Let it flourish!
7668 2018-09-23 21:18:30 @FBN_help  I used the POS at a forte oil petrol station on Friday , my ATM card was declined but I got debited N5,000. I haven't gotten any reverse yet.
7669 2018-09-23 21:18:10 Just needs Rose to keep leaking oil and he’s good to go 
7670 2018-09-23 21:17:52 パンさんおはようございます～！！

7672 2018-09-23 21:17:39 ambot ani day hahahaha mag dala jud ko anig efficacent oil HAHAHAHAAH
7673 2018-09-23 21:17:38 You can use rose water to spray on your scalp to stimulate growth . Also rose hip oil is great for your scalp massage. Tea tree oil shampoo works or you can add a few drops your shampoo. Aussie moist is a great inexpensive shampoo to use , and Joico K-Pak is great also $$
7674 2018-09-23 21:17:37 Self care really make you feel so good. Just rubbing cocoa butter and oil on my body after a hot shower just makes me incredibly happy.
7675 2018-09-23 21:17:35 Use oil
7676 2018-09-23 21:17:30 宏々さんおはようございます！
7677 2018-09-23 21:17:24 Who really cares.  You have China & Russia forming a military alliance, NoKo making you look like a fool (kinda easy), Everyone in your inner circle involved in one scandal after another, you need to get your penis fixed, Venezuela agreeing to provide oil to China.
GOLF  BFD!
7678 2018-09-23 21:17:09 Except one is for coal & oil and drilling up america and the other is for wind and solar.  This is not a comparison.  For a "science" person you sure have no clue
7679 2018-09-23 21:17:07 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
7680 2018-09-23 21:16:15 take a look around where you sit right now

 remove anything that contains a component of oil coal or gas

  replace anything  that could be produced  entirely from the output of windfarms/ solar panels

 you are now sitting naked on bare earth starving to death
7681 2018-09-23 21:16:14 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
7682 2018-09-23 21:16:06 well that part of Nafta I do not like, where we have to sell the US our oil first
7683 2018-09-23 21:15:57 Qué rico! los otros días hice unas papas "Irish Bombay" con curry, olive oil, romero, albahaca, oregano & salvia

7687 2018-09-23 21:15:46 Blend 8 oz venison with 8 oz cheese. Mix in Olive Oil. Roast. Serve a la mode
7688 2018-09-23 21:15:38 @FirstBankngr I used the POS at a forte oil petrol station on Friday , my ATM card was declined but I got debited N5,000. I haven't gotten any reverse yet.
7689 2018-09-23 21:15:33 City sold out. They aren't a team for the fans, they're a rich prince's play toy. Sure their fans took it, they were a yo yo team before oil money. We aren't. We're an established Serie A team. I want our identity to remain. Football isn't all about winning.
7690 2018-09-23 21:15:18 Extra Virgin Coconut oil 
7691 2018-09-23 21:15:17 Coconut oil is the best make up remover ever
7692 2018-09-23 21:15:17 I went to Ulta for tea tree oil. I left with 3 brushes, a beauty blender, body butter, a mask, and yes the tea tree oil. I hate myself.
7693 2018-09-23 21:15:02 @LOCCITANE_UK at what age can you start using the almond and shea oil on skin.? What do you recommend using for babies?
7694 2018-09-23 21:14:52 That feeling when you're up for work super early when it's still dark out and then double check your planner and realise the shift is for next week  already oil pulling so might as well just have a super nice start to a long day off heh 
7695 2018-09-23 21:14:32 Yo girl just got her car washed, oil changed, Nails & toes did. What’s the move? I’m tryna mob somewhere 
7696 2018-09-23 21:14:31 Sorry Oil of Olay, you didn’t invent b/w photography. New company photos.

7698 2018-09-23 21:14:07 America need to trade @AnnCoulter for more oil.
7699 2018-09-23 21:14:02 If you research it it becomes quite frightening actually the US and UK governments recently made major arms deals with the Saudis in exchange for oil deals the Saudis are destroying Yemen with these weapons because they are shias like Iran not Sunnis like them and it goes deeper
7700 2018-09-23 21:13:59 No greater feeling then the oil hitting your scalp making everything feel silk and smooth 
7701 2018-09-23 21:13:36 When you used to use coconut oil for everything but now you only use it for sex stuff.
7702 2018-09-23 21:13:29 interestingly, Saudi Arabia has biggest oil reserves in the world, have complete ability to manipulate oil price, and SEC enables 3x leveraged oil etf to trade, thats cool.

this is all goes very deep.  the future is BFT, not politicians
7703 2018-09-23 21:13:19 In all seriousness, this is probably exactly where we’re headed. People who don’t document every moment of their lives on a public forum will be seen as suspect and “hiding something.” 
7704 2018-09-23 21:13:14 Justin is leaking major oil. Tiggy got a chance #tourChampionship2018
7705 2018-09-23 21:13:11 If Horschel pars 18 or better and Rose keeps leaking oil, this could be happening
7706 2018-09-23 21:13:09 I think it’s a holdover from the days when monounsaturated fats ruled supreme in the diet landscape. Olive oil was the “heathy choice” so you if you could position even a snack food that way, you would.
7707 2018-09-23 21:13:09 I’ve been having way too many oil spills someone gotta pack me out get me on check lmao

7713 2018-09-23 21:11:55 YEP AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH NAIL OIL I USE THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO STAY LONG
7714 2018-09-23 21:11:42 Bodes well. I’ve just panicked and ordered more oil. And a winter coat 
7715 2018-09-23 21:11:41 five guys cooks stuff in peanut oil i do not trust that
7716 2018-09-23 21:11:39 just stop palm oil production already
7717 2018-09-23 21:11:34 My hair is the type of hair that holds everything except curls. 
Shampoo? would smell like it for two days
Oil? will look oily for a week
Tangles? ALWAYS
ugly messy curls: Forever
curling iron curles: NEVER.

7719 2018-09-23 21:11:21 So I started following the beard oil dudes on IG.... cause I support #beards but I didn't know every time I opened up ID im gonna see a half naked bearded Spartan....  I'm just gonna follow @IGGYAZALEA
7720 2018-09-23 21:11:17 My nephew told his dad, "Changing the oil is hard. It took forever to put the new oil in through that tiny hole." It was the dipstick tube.
7721 2018-09-23 21:11:08 Its irresponsible to compare two very different issues. A human rights fiasco & state depravity & a medical, social emergency &state neglect

7726 2018-09-23 21:10:28 *whispers* What is the point of any product that advertises "made with olive oil" as a plus if it's.... also made with vegetable/soy/canola, etc. 

As someone who is allergic to everything but olive oil & butter, I sincerely want to know....?
7727 2018-09-23 21:10:16 Let’s see how much we can pile on. I have the flu, I have 2 exams and a paper due this week, I got dumped without an explanation, my parents are out of the country so I’m in charge of 1 dog, 4 cats, 2 children, 2 houses, and 10383817375828485 fish. Oh and I need an oil change
7728 2018-09-23 21:10:15 As it should! This is nature as oil and gas companies like to think of it, not as people with critical politics do. As long as one views it with that in mind ...
7729 2018-09-23 21:10:07 This is lemon juice and zest, olive oil, garlic and lots of herbs
7730 2018-09-23 21:10:04 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
7731 2018-09-23 21:09:58 There is no recipe per se, it was pork (currently £2 a kilo at tesco) potatos, carrots, onions, parsnips and swede. Add oil, salt and pepper and thyme and rosemary and bake at 150c for 90 minutes. Turn up to 200c for 30 minutes to crisp up. Use a meat thermometer to test.
7732 2018-09-23 21:09:57 Can coconut oil fix your sadness?
7733 2018-09-23 21:09:56 An export pipeline, even with refineries, does nothing to free us from the US oil industry. Shifting off of oil, by contrast, does.
7734 2018-09-23 21:09:52 Your grandmother has pimp oil; I love her
7735 2018-09-23 21:09:34 What's on my mind today I am so bored at my door it wished I had somebody to hang out with instead I guess I better just go change my oil on my truck I hope I don't hurt my back again
7736 2018-09-23 21:09:28 Was thinking

Wondering if JIFFY CORNBREAD and JIFFY LUBE are owned by the same person and if so, why y’all don’t offer complimentary CORNBREAD while people waiting on a OIL CHANGE
7737 2018-09-23 21:09:22 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7738 2018-09-23 21:09:15 Use castor oil on your scalp! Or vitamin E oil
7739 2018-09-23 21:08:50 So no excuse for oil over 70 a bbl.
7740 2018-09-23 21:08:48 no, but they have benefitted to tune of billions by indian workers employed in gulf sending money back to india. Kuwait has 30pc indian population sending a fortune in oil revenue back to india. The poverty in India should have been eradicated 40 yrs ago through this money.
7741 2018-09-23 21:08:42 Im sure there is going to be something to celebrate ! ... but I always lose out and do the wrong thing though ... I just know I will sell my shares at the wrong moment and find they carry on going up.
7742 2018-09-23 21:08:39 I decided if I take care of my skin, I will avoid the need to "mask" certain areas.I now get away with just mascara.Then Sunday "special" I make an effort and wear foundation.Pabvudzi ndipo pasara.I've failed to waste money on hair. Solution is wash, oil & and comb my fro!
7743 2018-09-23 21:08:33 You didn't say that this morning .... what is the link to this weekly oil news please
7744 2018-09-23 21:08:31 "For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. lt strengthens lashes and cools your eyes."
7745 2018-09-23 21:08:25 Worldly pleasure 

Proverbs 21:17 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.

(Song never look back!!!)

Proverbs 10:4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
7746 2018-09-23 21:08:25 Can’t inconvenience the oil companies without losing your right to carry a gun or vote.  Seems extreme to me. Maybe the oil companies want to take away our guns.
7747 2018-09-23 21:08:21 I'm an oil painter in Colorado; how can I arrange permission from you to paint this? I respect property and copyright, and only proceed with photographers' permission, including payment and agreement to protect the original imagery. Can we work it out for this?
7748 2018-09-23 21:08:21 You are wrong oil Is going to 75
7749 2018-09-23 21:07:55 We all need to wear body cameras 24hrs a day.
7750 2018-09-23 21:07:48 Got my oil changed & washed all my clothes  more things off my check list!!
7751 2018-09-23 21:07:35 It’s the end of the first period and neither the Pontiacs or the Oil Barons have found the back of the net.
7752 2018-09-23 21:07:32 Brown sugar and olive oil as an exfoliater
7753 2018-09-23 21:07:22 It has oil in it so it still spreads fine. You know the butter with the oils in it so it’s spreadable? That’s how it is!
7754 2018-09-23 21:07:16 There trying every which possible way and angle to enforce military action with Iran aren't they 
It's getting silly now they may aswel just come out with it 'we want control of your banking system,switch you to trading with the petro dollar and control of your oil reserves'
7755 2018-09-23 21:07:07 Mary Shelley, Percy And Byron had a night. Frankenstein was birthed. And his monster. We all have such nights. And they don’t make us famous

7760 2018-09-23 21:06:10 Maybe documenting every single second of their lives will be a good idea after all. When this crap happens to a Supreme Court nominee 35 years from now: "These selfies from the dates in question, taken at various landmarks throughout Europe..."
7761 2018-09-23 21:05:45 Cbd oil sorted my groin out.
7762 2018-09-23 21:05:45 I do use danish oil but not on these. I use a waterproof protector oil from a company called @osmo_uk

7766 2018-09-23 21:04:54 i thought it was cooking oil
7767 2018-09-23 21:04:20 Oil change, tire change, hose/belt inspection, tire pressure, fluid levels.
7768 2018-09-23 21:04:20 Lmao! I chop am, na hot oil desolve am 
7769 2018-09-23 21:03:54 I thought about that! But I might, just might, have the energy to cook. And if that's the case, I don't want my PJs to smell like oil/spices!
7770 2018-09-23 21:03:30 Scoreless third thus far. Still 5-3 Bow Valley.
7771 2018-09-23 21:03:17 Thank you, and yes everyone needs some oil wrestling in their lives!

7773 2018-09-23 21:02:59 The end of the Ottoman Empire had something to do with the mentality of Muslims toward dominating nations. There is a divide between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. The West has had better weapons for a long time. And we have our own oil. #UseYourBigHead
7774 2018-09-23 21:02:34 They used to be able to subsidize the oil exports with agriculture. That hasn't been viable since 20th century, and the Chavez government took steps to start diversifying the economy which has been stopped by the remains of Venazuela's private economy.
7775 2018-09-23 21:02:13 This is the one then I use olive oil to moisturise afterwards.
7776 2018-09-23 21:01:56 2019 would be a year were Nigerians would grow in wealth,eradication of poverty, economic restructuring, changes in the bastardized oil sector,creations of Jobs to the people, and rebalancing the economic flow of money, and this can only be achieved with @BUKOLA SARAKI#

7779 2018-09-23 21:01:45 As I said, it is always possible to walk away from a treaty but there are consequences. Financial institutions will always follow the money (oil etc.). The UN guarantees the right to self determination. The problem was the antipathy of the EU. #Brexit changed that.
7780 2018-09-23 21:01:34 OK smart people, explain to me then why they call it stove top stuffing… Is there such thing as a stove bottom… The whole thing is called the stove… The oven is part of the stove

7790 2018-09-23 21:00:30 I decided to figure out how to give my car an oil change today. Now I’m truly wondering how much I have wasted getting them done at a shop. That shit easy AF

7792 2018-09-23 21:00:27 do you finish them with danish oil or similar?
7793 2018-09-23 21:00:10 Investing in green tech is the better bet for meeting that goal. While having the advantage of not needing to risk billions of dollars betting on finding new customers for last century's energy at a time when the world is awash in oil and gluts keep forming.
7794 2018-09-23 21:00:06 Changing oil and filters, checking tire pressure, radiator fluids switch out for winter, break fluid check and refill, changing out batteries and breakers.  These are the little things that all cars need, and cost far too much at the garage.
7795 2018-09-23 20:59:54 Check tire pressure, and understand when to get oil changes and new tires!!
7796 2018-09-23 20:59:47 Take my oil to get changed every 3 months and every 3 months my ass acts surprised when they tell me the total . Low key wish I knew how to do my own oil changes 
7797 2018-09-23 20:59:38 Terrifying to think of @scottishlabour in charge of a $1tn oil fund.
7798 2018-09-23 20:59:36 You keep trying to pick apart my thought process; it is both of you that refuse to look at reality; it isn't even "fossil fuels" that's a myth too, started by the oil companies; they are hydrocarbons, that can occur without fossils.  Geez.. just stay in your own echo chamber
7799 2018-09-23 20:59:21 I paid $12 for my oil change, happy Sunday 
7800 2018-09-23 20:59:11 That’s real cute ‘happy hemp oil’  Yessss, I love it! I tell all my friends and family about it
7801 2018-09-23 20:58:49 Makes sense.  So does coconut oil.
7802 2018-09-23 20:58:45 Al crack the jokes she has never kept a promise to busy trying to split the country and keep all that oil samond promised
7803 2018-09-23 20:58:45 I like to sauté my brown rice in a healthy oil before I add water/stock. It makes it taste sort of nutty and flavorful. I also like to use leftover meat stock instead of plain water to hydrate/steam the rice.
7804 2018-09-23 20:58:45 Listen suzuki you got rich off oil and gas and now you think its a bad idea you would say that now your rolling in money if it wasnt for oil you wouldnt be who you are today because you cant tell us you walked to all those wonderful  places in the world hypoc

7806 2018-09-23 20:58:33 I'm suddenly feeling very glad we're on oil...
7807 2018-09-23 20:58:07 Again and again OPEC is facing the same dilema as 2008-2009, with the exception that today shale oil has reach big steps in its learning curve in term of cost and efficiency, and consequently spare capacity in some OPEC producing countries is not an issue for the time being!

7812 2018-09-23 20:57:37 Who want to defeat you ?  Is there Gold mountains or there are oil oceans or you are Royal people of the world ?  You have high concerns with pak economy.  Actually its yours money we get from US, IMF and used this money against you people.
7813 2018-09-23 20:57:29 Wait but lavender oil surely isn’t safe to ingest. Right????????????
7814 2018-09-23 20:57:27 Make sure your oils are therapeutic grade, more expensive but worth it. Not just scented kind. I use a little coconut oil from grocery store as my carrier oil if you rub on bottom of feet. Tons of sleep blends on Pinterest.
7815 2018-09-23 20:57:16 I owe you beer . Remind me when I am in Lagos .
7816 2018-09-23 20:57:12 Changing a tire.  Adding windshield wiper fluid and antifreeze.  Checking the oil dipstick. Changing windshield wipers.  Changing burned out turn signal bulbs.

So much is computerized nowadays, it's hard to say what is accessible for the average consumer anymore.
7817 2018-09-23 20:57:11 Yes. And Albertas elected representatives may decide to shut the oil off to BC. Think of of it as helping meet the BC emissions goals.
7818 2018-09-23 20:57:06 Maybe change that to "Neem oil poisoning" and you might find the truth is out there...
7819 2018-09-23 20:56:50 I learned how to change a tire and oil when I was 16. 
7820 2018-09-23 20:56:42 Thank you so much, Jenny and i blast all of your impressive videos as far and wide as possible.  I'm an independent crude oil contractor/business development and spend a lot of time on the computer.  I deal with Asia, India, South Korea and U.S. crude producers.  Joseph  
7821 2018-09-23 20:56:37 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
7822 2018-09-23 20:56:19 I wonder if the CBD oil is helping with that too. She looks so content.
7823 2018-09-23 20:56:14 If he doesn’t work for NASA, owns oil companies, owns cellphone companies, is in a Fortune 500 business, is a stock broker, or Congressman ... I won’t be bothered. That’s just how it is. I’ve had enough childish betas to last a lifetime.
7824 2018-09-23 20:56:13 Oil, folks! 
7825 2018-09-23 20:56:08 Of the gallons of Fantasia videos, this is in my top 5! We snicker along with her playful mischievousness as she coaxes her Mom to sing a praise. Ms Diane CARRIED the oil! The lineage is evident. We adore the “normal life” peak into her very extraordinary life. Thank you. Love.

7827 2018-09-23 20:55:53 I was so skeptical about trying cbd oil but it has honestly helped me out so much lately. Less anxiety attacks, not so anxious all the time, & peaceful sleep
7828 2018-09-23 20:55:28 Looking for good cooking oil to pack in a kit GreetingsAs the title says, I am looking for a good oil to take on short/medium-length trips. I have read that olive oil can go rancid when exposed to heat, would it be best for me to take a certain type of oil or does it not mat…

7836 2018-09-23 20:54:06 My death will most likely be because I accidentally drove into the hole at the oil change shop.
7837 2018-09-23 20:54:05 I like the way you think.

7842 2018-09-23 20:53:05 That loan was not drawn upon, and it was caused by OPEC doubling oil prices. If you look at history, the Tories have borrowed more than every Labour government combined.  By the way, the tax rate in 1948 was 98%, they didn't leave the country then and they won't now.
7843 2018-09-23 20:52:47 Hawu nami am asking my self and when u use abo castor oil ngeke Ikuphathe lezinto.

7852 2018-09-23 20:51:53 My fam loves Cauli fried rice. Just fry some grated cauli in oil & butter. Throw in some extra veggies, onion, garlic. Add more butter & fry an egg. Season with soy sauce or coconut aminos & can add whatever else you like. Hot sauce, bit of broth, etc. My 6 yo likes soy only.
7853 2018-09-23 20:51:19 Isn't oil that stuff that gets all slippery when it rains on our roads already?

7861 2018-09-23 20:50:18 If he puts a 25-cent a tax on gas, it will obscure the 50-cent gas price rise caused by Trump's Iran oil embargo.

Never mind that putting the tax on, triggers conditions like after the subprime mortgage crisis,  2007 to 2010. 

Remember 2008, waiting to buy gas? Trump doesn't.
7862 2018-09-23 20:50:18 Sometimes I do, usually only add salt and olive oil.
7863 2018-09-23 20:50:14 I love the smell of onion, garlic, and olive oil cooking  #SundayDinner
7864 2018-09-23 20:50:09 Get lavender oil. In bed just before you turn your light out, put two drops on the bottom of each foot. Rub together. NO MORE THAN TWO, or you might sleep deeply enough to pee yourself. Don't ask how I know.
7865 2018-09-23 20:49:53 @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @ArifAlvi Saudi's investment they have experience in Oil&Gas, construction & mining can't we have a partnership deal at govt level in same area to develop our own oil feild we do have reserves in large quantity along with the mining feild enable us indep.
7866 2018-09-23 20:49:50 I have cooked so much Hungarian food recently, that today we had no lard left for the Sunday potatoes and had to use vegetable oil.

7872 2018-09-23 20:48:53 Wanna know why Iran isn’t a full democracy? Thanks to US gov’t, CIA, & UK.

In 1950s, Iran had a real democracy. Perhaps the truest democracy that has ever existed in the Middle East, to this day.

In 1953, to steal Iran’s oil: US/UK orchestrated a coup to overthrow PM Mossadegh.

7874 2018-09-23 20:48:39 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

7884 2018-09-23 20:47:21 Come to Nigeria,  it is the same case. We produce crude oil, sell and transport them to Europe to be refined and we buy them back in a much higher amount. Main while,  we have about 4 to 5 refineries that the government can redevelop and make them functional again.  ~kegame

My works were large oil paintings with a lot of toxic chemicals involved, which wasn't so good to combine with breastfeeding. I've always imagined doing writing & artwork for a book. We'll see if this is the one!
7899 2018-09-23 20:44:15 I actually have loads of coconut oil and castor oil in my hair rn, i’ve been pretty inconsistent with doing this so my results haven’t been super noticeable. Have you noticed it doing anything beneficial for ur hair ? just curious :-)
7900 2018-09-23 20:44:09 cc: @aminu3214 hate to say this, but I told you so.
7901 2018-09-23 20:44:05 Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) Visakhapatnam gets legal status. State provided 200 acres land free of cost. Center to provide Rs 655 crore through budgetary provision and Rs 400 Crore will be funded by oil companies.  #USAWelcomesCBN #NRTDPUSA @NCBN
7902 2018-09-23 20:43:50 Ksjdksj I just got a coffee and coconut oil scrub and Ima get the first one you recommended. If that doesn't work I'll go for lush is what I mean
7903 2018-09-23 20:43:43 Tipo Standar Oil?
7904 2018-09-23 20:43:41 Stop using dirty palm oil in kit Keats etc you are KILLING orangutan so for fracking chocolate!!
7905 2018-09-23 20:43:28 One of my most favorite cookbooks. Pages 70-71 are especially festooned with olive oil and lemon juice splatters. 
7906 2018-09-23 20:43:23 How big of a loan they can sign you up for to pay for all the snake oil they want to sell you.
7907 2018-09-23 20:43:22 Hankerchief or Terry towelling with some rubbed in by the bedside works quite well. Or dissolve vaporub or eucalyptus oil in some hot water
7908 2018-09-23 20:43:17 Yep. We did this when I was young, and olive oil was bought in a pharmacy, not a supermarket!
7909 2018-09-23 20:43:14 My car says I’m due for an oil change but I just checked it and my oil is pristine clean. 
7910 2018-09-23 20:43:12 Have you read the 2017 budget performance report? Everything generated from oil wasn't even enough for our recurrent. We are in a very tight spot. We must reduce costs of governance, prioritise maybe 4 or 5 sector and make huge investments.

7913 2018-09-23 20:42:25 Yeah it’s so weird I have lots of friends who use coconut oil as makeup remover so I figured itd be fine for me too but my skin HATES it but like I said my body doesn’t react to it cuz I still eat stuff w it alllll the time. But that’s a really good idea thanks!
7914 2018-09-23 20:42:23 cooking oil is for u food not ur hair pamela
7915 2018-09-23 20:42:18 is that why broken glass disappears when submerged in cooking oil?
7916 2018-09-23 20:42:17 Posted 1:31pm: F3 discussing what HGs real life is. They laugh about Faysal being a substitute teacher in FL and say he teaches how to put olive oil on your body. Tyler says that is F'd up. #BB20 #BBLF

7918 2018-09-23 20:42:11 I’ve been cooking with baby oil and news flash: it’s completely vegan. 

...What? No, it’s not made of... you sir, shut up. You ruined something that was supposed to just be fun and nonsensical. Get this idiot out of here.
7919 2018-09-23 20:42:02 飯、24日の昼までには予定決めて頂けると助かります
7920 2018-09-23 20:41:55 Dearest Mother, 

While on the field of Eagles my sidearm was true but the Howitzer would not load. Please send goober peas, squirrel oil and ramrod. Ordinances running low.
7921 2018-09-23 20:41:47 sorry facts are facts, cooking oil
7922 2018-09-23 20:41:21 おはようございます
7923 2018-09-23 20:41:11 @q95 It would make my day if you played Cover You in Oil by @acdc for me.
7924 2018-09-23 20:41:11 That is the worry about DMC5, I know that they said it's optional, but I look at that as snake oil salesmen speech, because in the end, they only want to get consumers money, and with the reputation Microtransactions have, then it's not great coming out and saying "CASH PLZ!"
7925 2018-09-23 20:41:09 About to hop on the fish oil pills !
7926 2018-09-23 20:41:07 States like Ekiti and Osun with bloated civil service will continue to bear this burden except Oil prices go back to their crazy rates of five years ago. 
It is either salaries are paid with federal allocation or projects are done. There won't be enough to do both.
7927 2018-09-23 20:41:03 I take Mag daily, but I’ve been putting some CBD oil balm on my temples today, and that seems to be taking the edge off a bit.
7928 2018-09-23 20:41:03 Don’t listen to cooking oil
7929 2018-09-23 20:40:59 Not pliable enough. Needs some TB12 snake oil
7930 2018-09-23 20:40:32 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
7931 2018-09-23 20:40:30 I went to Abravanel for the symphony last night and got a migraine walking in from all the oil people outside. Unreal that many people buy into it.
7932 2018-09-23 20:40:30 Yeah I talk about being independent and not needing men but my dad expects me to take my car to get an oil change without him and suddenly I’m a fragile southern belle
7933 2018-09-23 20:40:26 #SOLO #AEX More gas and the hunt for oil.

The search for oil continues following the traps where the gas has displaced any oil, west and up dip and left the residues found in the cuttings, for example at NT-2.
The 3D seismic should reveal a little more as well as the C-1 drill
7934 2018-09-23 20:40:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
7935 2018-09-23 20:39:58 I remove my makeup all the time with coconut oil and haven’t had that problem :-( i’m sorry tht happened tho !  I would maybe do a strand test if ur worried about it ??
7936 2018-09-23 20:39:52 @MBuhari want to sell #Biafra oil resources to #China via #Collateral . Behold the wicked tactice of a useless #Lifeless islamic #Terrorist. @MBuhari is a #Frudster! #Criminal!
7937 2018-09-23 20:39:48  mfs wanna be right so much think whatever you want but its oil lmaoo
7938 2018-09-23 20:39:38 Go for it!!!!!! That’s even when Coconut Oil will make sense more, your head will just be shining
7939 2018-09-23 20:39:16 Oil markets are incredibly cyclical and inelastic. Oil is going much higher, and much lower in the future. Based on current supply/demand fundamentals, and capital underinvestment my bet is on much higher near to medium term, baring any major macro event like a recession.
7940 2018-09-23 20:39:10 I believe oil n Keenum, penalties killed this game.  Not sure about some of the plays called that made no sense.
7941 2018-09-23 20:39:07 Yep! Tomb raiding rope and tomb raiding guns and tomb raiding gun oil and skin tight latex clothing and
7942 2018-09-23 20:38:59 Does that mean more women in the NHL, oil rig workers, steel workers, race car drivers,army general's etc
7943 2018-09-23 20:38:35 My bf’s beard oil is really just a mixture of essential oils so you already know we sharing it 
7944 2018-09-23 20:38:34 Either running fat or burning oil.
7945 2018-09-23 20:38:32 Egg yolk, lemon juice, and soybean oil is literally mayo... and bbq sauce is ketchup with smoke flavor and a few extra seasonings lol
7946 2018-09-23 20:37:58 I always wished to not have oily skin but rn for some weird reason my skin is dry af & it NEVER IS ! It’s way worse than being oily  oil come back to me lmfao

7951 2018-09-23 20:37:15 That would be the most useful thing NZ could do to reduce global CO2 emissions. Produce those huge gas fields we have and export the gas to China and India so they burn less coal. Opps, you bozos shut down the oil and gas industry... D’oh....
7952 2018-09-23 20:37:08 Exfoliate at home then apply straight rose hip oil and leave it on all night, by morning you'll look amazing and your skin will feel like a baby's!
7953 2018-09-23 20:36:25 Oh and I'm from the Tropics. Something else I should be thankful of. Oil was born in the British Consulate. Yes.
7954 2018-09-23 20:36:10 Na. They'll buy a failing oil and gas company to find the oil to produce rocket fuel. It has to be believable to be synergistic....
7955 2018-09-23 20:36:07 hi twitter doctors. I used to do coconut oil hair masks all the time but one time I put it on my face (bad advice from someone) & broke out in super itchy hives so I stopped using it but I‘m able to eat it without problems, do y’all think it’d be safe to use in my hair again
7956 2018-09-23 20:36:00 Technically palm oil is vegan, however some choose to avoid it due to its shitty production causing immense devastation to animals & plant life. Problem is it’s in so much stuff these days, & rarely sustainable. I avoid what I can.
7957 2018-09-23 20:34:59 To me the hard thing to determine is the timing and sequence of events. Does oil really spike over the next 6-9 months and lead to a global recession or does a recession precede a real spike and then make the oil cycle aligned with the economic cycle going down and coming out?
7958 2018-09-23 20:34:52 Imran Khan’s tweet got indians riled up; now they’re doing hate tweets that discredit critical Pakistanis as  unpatriotic. All works out.

7970 2018-09-23 20:33:51 for me, white chocolate will always be a decorative type of product. and for that, it’s most excellent and can be quite elegant.
i do make a fierce white choc and hazelnut cheesecake, but i don’t eat it.
i mean, it’s not even choc, it’s oil, milk and sugar 
7971 2018-09-23 20:33:45 The irony is that the patents they have buried are probably for batteries.  If the oil companies had a way of improving efficiency or reducing emissions, now would be the time to reveal this. The ICE is old tech & will be largely obselete in transport use cases in the next 20yrs.
7972 2018-09-23 20:33:37 I cam see from the response you habe and their pictures it is obvious that you wont have any friends.
But always speak the truth and not what oil money tells you.
All the best

8001 2018-09-23 20:29:08 So do you recommend the oil instead of the spray? This sounds so silly I know but does the oil not leave your hair all greasy when you get up in the morning? Sorry for the 101 questions  xx
8002 2018-09-23 20:29:00 That's exactly what it's like but kinda more impressive because refining oil is a significantly more dangerous business than cooking 'caine.

8035 2018-09-23 20:22:44 Looks much better to me than taking official pronouncements at face value like the agencies have to and the banks chose to. Also,Shale hasn't banished oil's cyclicality but will enhance it. Half a decade of underinvestment can't be overcome in an year or two even with investment.

8039 2018-09-23 20:21:33 It does, GA is like a oil tanker trying to do a 3 point turn. Change comes slowly...., but I hope it gets there
8040 2018-09-23 20:21:23 Diabetes is NOT a 'disease of choice', as Tim Noakes says it is. Many diabetics' determinants of health prevent them from having the money for adequate FOOD to begin with, not to mention grass fed meat and coconut oil. 
I'm sorry that people still can't understand this.

8046 2018-09-23 20:20:29 3- - Without oil, the most common job in US and Europe would be cleaning streets from horse manure
8047 2018-09-23 20:20:27 Maybe they believe they found the miracle cure and the snake oil really worked

8049 2018-09-23 20:19:35 That is the way that was reported. 
I disagree.
1- oil discovery saved the whales from extinction
2- Oil discovery enabled us to produce fertilizers that fed the largest increase in population in history  and eliminated famines and disease that were very common

8051 2018-09-23 20:19:20 Somebody tell Pompeo: It comes from U.S. actions (regime change, continual war, war for oil, foreign interference).
8052 2018-09-23 20:19:13 when the jugular of global oil is cut, the industrial complexity of the developed west will die.

When (not if) that happens, we might be lucky to hold onto an existence akin to that of the 14th century, which is what the religious zealots want to inflict on all of us.

8058 2018-09-23 20:18:19 Soak your feet and legs in a bucket while you're doing nothing. Put a little baby oil in the water. Clean them after relaxing and before the water gets cool.
8059 2018-09-23 20:18:12 BBC headline states "Look in mirror after attack, US tells Iran". Interesting. When the US is a victim of an attack in the future, I wonder what Iran will say to the US? Depressing truth is the US will never be happy until it controls Iran's oil. Some things never change. #FBPE
8060 2018-09-23 20:18:06  Not to mention the EPA as he poisoned himself and all around. Special high temp burners needed for waste oil heating (not allowed in Ireland by said EPA; must be in collusion with Revenue!)
8061 2018-09-23 20:17:54 Like don’t put oil in the boiling water, drain it first then mix it with oil?
8062 2018-09-23 20:17:54 It’s terrible when you mean to say later gater as in short for see you later, alligator, and autocorrects it to later hater. #hate-speech
8063 2018-09-23 20:17:53 This gives me goosebumps! I didn’t know he instructed his spiritual children not to watch TV. My infant son was ill and I blessed him with Padre Pio oil and asked him to pray for him. In that moment, I heard with great clarity, “Stop watching TV.” So I did. #FeastDay
8064 2018-09-23 20:17:41 I got new beard balms, two brushes, and some beard oil. It's lit.

8070 2018-09-23 20:16:52 Studying up before I head to the polls & I'm looking into Mike Collier for Lt. Gov.

8071 2018-09-23 20:16:52 Bush did 9/11 and nobody is willing to admit it but me! Man didn’t land on the moon--reptiles did! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
8072 2018-09-23 20:16:50 finally getting a oil change 
8073 2018-09-23 20:16:50 We love positive stories like yours! So happy hemp oil has benefitted you.

Raiders suck, Gruden sold us snake oil and is laughing all the way to the bank. 

I just can’t wait to hear how you guys spin that Niners loss
8082 2018-09-23 20:15:11 Girls will lie they using coconut oil to glow their skin, even caption 'spot that glow', don't try that shot please, u will look dirty and darker AF.
8083 2018-09-23 20:15:10 Not only that but the combination of snake oil rigged five year terms, as a pretence to getting the economy on track, a craven play for another year of corruption
8084 2018-09-23 20:15:08 Hmm. Well as a non religious person whose lived his whole life (except 12 years in England) in the North East, & now works in the oil industry, I've ever heard anyone go on about religion. (other than to laugh about it and roll their eyes, I'm fully on board with that) 1/2
8085 2018-09-23 20:15:00 Why do people say “I never chop food wey get oil” today? Oya dip the bread inside oil and chew na

8088 2018-09-23 20:14:36 Are you referring to Cannabidiol CBD oil, a (non-psychoactive) chemical compound in marijuana?
8089 2018-09-23 20:14:35 It’s a Netflix series. In the near future, Norway is occupied by Russia on behalf of the European Union because  of a newly elected environmentally-friendly Norwegian govt that wants to stop oil production. You might not sleep after watching it
8090 2018-09-23 20:14:34 Buckingham Palace, Russia rebuff Trump's call for immediate boost to oil output
8091 2018-09-23 20:14:24 Giving my locs a hot oil treatment

8096 2018-09-23 20:14:02 Tanners Canyon Snakeroot: Flowers are soft. Fruit an oil painting.
8097 2018-09-23 20:13:37 I use some essential oils on an oil burner to get a nice smell pervading the room. It's something I associated with relaxing, so it's a reinforcing circle, the smell reminds me of relaxing times, so I relax, and associate the smell with relaxation.
8098 2018-09-23 20:13:35 So -they Can get Oil from US, Norway, Russia or other places 50% of Oil does not come from Islamic countries
8099 2018-09-23 20:13:32 rude @kdunlap16

8102 2018-09-23 20:13:17 there are real possibilities out there in oil or coal or used-to-be-steel regions of retraining people for better more healthy/longlasting jobs but the industry has such a stranglehold that it's never a REAL possibility
8103 2018-09-23 20:13:17 If oil is up. Ucad is down
8104 2018-09-23 20:13:04 Colts now 1-2 on the year.

8108 2018-09-23 20:12:31 It was the oil companies concession after 25 yrs old concession from 1954-1979 that was over and shah felt Iran is capable enough to have full control of its oil. There are interviews of him in English French and Germany about this.
8109 2018-09-23 20:12:29 tea tree/lavender oil (doterra), pacifica vegan coconut micellar water, witch hazel
8110 2018-09-23 20:12:25 Thanks to Trump's energy policies we are no longer dependent on foreign oil. We now produce enough energy that we are actually exporting energy
8111 2018-09-23 20:12:03 Great, more oil.  I'd much rather see us take a leadership role in developing renewable alternative energy sources and products.
8112 2018-09-23 20:11:49 I bought a white bloomer today,lovely bread but I was horrified to see it has palm oil in it.
8113 2018-09-23 20:11:45 Remember, the bible says that Godlessness will increase on the earth in the last days that even the very elect will be deceived. You better carry extra oil brother and learn to logically articulate why you believe what you believe in addition to ...
8114 2018-09-23 20:11:26 Its so hard to choose - but we love the smell of the moisturiser grapefruit & tea tree oil 
8115 2018-09-23 20:11:26 I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression at the start of 2017 and have been on medication for this since then. Never had any problems before until the past few nights. I'm wondering if its worth getting my meds reviewed? I must try that lavender oil also. Thank u doll!  Xx
8116 2018-09-23 20:11:03 OILS TO FADE ACNE SCARS:

LAVENDER OIL!

TEA TREE OIL!

OLIVE OIL!

ROSEHIP OIL
8117 2018-09-23 20:10:23 Oil change lls
8118 2018-09-23 20:10:09 Any budget deficit we have would be negated by having control of the revenue we currently pump into Westminster through oil, whisky etc
8119 2018-09-23 20:10:04 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
8120 2018-09-23 20:09:57 Ororo no be crude oil......
8121 2018-09-23 20:09:52 @ThomboyD Got magnesium oil, & I’m impressed w/1st application! I have knee pain from two trail runs. It helped. Not out of water yet, but hopeful. Amazing on my calves. Tight, a quick, light rub w/oil softened them right up! They were hard, now they’re pliable. Great stuff!  Ty!
8122 2018-09-23 20:09:18 Yet she’ll be re-elected over and over again.
8123 2018-09-23 20:09:13 omg I have so much coconut oil in my hair and it’s so short now I look like a dyke when I brush it back

8126 2018-09-23 20:08:50 Glad pops is feeling better. Spray oil on the 7 padres fans that will be there today.
8127 2018-09-23 20:08:49 Swiss ambassador to Nigeria is being bribed with oil blocs from Biafra land to stop #MNK family from attending @UN invitation but how little does he know the God Almighty that hardened the heart of phero against the people of Israel that he may be honored
8128 2018-09-23 20:08:45 what she believes is irrelevant. fact is she was not witness to the specific allegation. drink 3 tons of fish oil and try to improve your intelligence please, you really need it
8129 2018-09-23 20:08:37 Try lots of coconut oil, but I guess it is easier just go pick up some butter
8130 2018-09-23 20:08:17 That was completely justified though. The Empire of Japan attacked us because we refused to give them oil after learning of their empire building in the Pacific.
8131 2018-09-23 20:08:12 Raiders and the 2nd half just don’t mix. It’s like oil and vinegar
8132 2018-09-23 20:08:03 @SamsungMobileSA Do you know the S9 takes pathetic photos at zoom? All images taken at any level of zoom have an oil painting effect to them? Time the world knows this “awesome” camera is not so awesome. The sensor appears to be in house ISOCELL. Even the S6 with Sony was better!
8133 2018-09-23 20:07:51 What are your estimates of shale oil production growth till next summer?
8134 2018-09-23 20:07:49 It's only for very special customers and ones that love Christmas. We will DM u all the details soon. xx
8135 2018-09-23 20:07:49 Agreed , God Bless !!!
8136 2018-09-23 20:07:25 Took my car in for an oil change and FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS LATER
8137 2018-09-23 20:07:18 U.K. Is not a single market of equal partners - Scotland is run by WM and WM has blown the oil fund that Scotland would have had on political projects that Scotland has no control over. Labour are moronically and blindly unionist.
8138 2018-09-23 20:07:01 @Dominos_UK proper pissed you’ve stopped doing the beautiful special pizzas with the chilli oil and posh ham with mini sweet peppers and goats cheese!!!!! Gutted!!!! The only pizzas I ever enjoyed 
8139 2018-09-23 20:06:47 No, it makes perfect sense. The banks need to be broken up just like the oil companies and auto companies once were. The sooner the better.
8140 2018-09-23 20:06:29 Question; if a person takes CBT oil would anything show up on a drugs wipe like certain perscribed drugs give a false positive? Thanks @ScotlandYardCSI
8141 2018-09-23 20:06:23 70% of #Yemen budget- before the troubles- came from the energy sector 

All energy fields and pipelines are in safe and secure areas

There’s no general expenditure

Meaning that revival of the energy sector could supply all our needs

Who’s preventing Oil & Gas export? And why?
8142 2018-09-23 20:06:16 FOR DARK CIRCLE: 
 
Mix 2tbsp turmeric powder, few drops of tomato juice and a few drops of sweet almond oil. Apply this to dark circles and leave on skin for approximately 10-20 mins
8143 2018-09-23 20:06:10 [insert joke about oil here] (note: I don't mean this as a serious point. I mean it entirely as a joke. Not a "haha only serious" thing.)
8144 2018-09-23 20:05:58 Okay tell that to the market women who toil from morning till night and still goes home to cook and clean for a dead beat husband. Or to the woman who sells akara on the street; her face blackened from smoke and the heat of oil all day.
8145 2018-09-23 20:05:38 Seth and me at Texas Roadhouse 
Seth: why do these places over compensate so much? My salmon tastes like it swam in nothing but oil and butter and it's so over seasoned... 

Me: * shoving the eighth sweet roll int my fat chipmunk cheeks drowned in butter*. " Yuh dmn day suk!"
8146 2018-09-23 20:05:21 Totally Fake News and eliminating environmental protections from coal, oil drilling, forest clearings, natural gas drilling and nuclear power plants aren’t impacting our air quality at all, right Donald ? 
8147 2018-09-23 20:04:59 I don't consider you a " bad guy " !!   I agree with your take.   I  refuse to let my political views affect my common sense  and my common sense tells me that YOU & Elisabeth are stand -up individuals.   Like it or not , I'm going to  respect and follow BOTH of you LOL !!
8148 2018-09-23 20:04:55 Coconut Oil
8149 2018-09-23 20:04:51 1/2  A study out of India came out that cooked-chilled-reheated basmati rice (made w/1 tsp coconut oil per dry cup) is lower in digestible carbs than freshly-cooked, so better for diabetics. It doesn't spike my brother's bs, at least (YMMV).
8150 2018-09-23 20:04:44 If you sautee them, which you should, it's not essential. Just sautee them in a little olive oil, put on some salt, water or Apple juice (delicious), put on a tight lid and steam until soft enough. Them season with pepper and nutmeg. Delicious!
8151 2018-09-23 20:04:23 Do you put cooking oil in pasta to stop it sticking together??
8152 2018-09-23 20:04:20 Big Kill! And right after the Oilers have a power play.
8153 2018-09-23 20:04:13 Look at labels - do not buy anything contains palm oil. Actually shop locally grown and fresh (farmers markets).
8154 2018-09-23 20:03:58 Oh, wat betreft Peak Oil: "The modern history of the petroleum industry is said to have begun in 1846 when Abraham Gessner of Nova Scotia devised a process to produce kerosene from coal." 

Oil world reserves (billions of tons) 240 
Coal world reserves (billions of tons) 890
8155 2018-09-23 20:03:52 Me: E cool , make I take small henny 
Ecool: Make I turn am for u make you no come pour am like engine oil 
8156 2018-09-23 20:03:47 Was with Mum this morning in Holland Barrett while she was looking for CBD oil. I mentioned I could get her actual weed if she wanted from the phone box down the road cos I know that’s a drug dealer’s depot, probably cheaper too. She declined 
8157 2018-09-23 20:03:37 I am guessing your boycott(?) of UKOG is ongoing and that you mean ANGS.  BB has/had the contract with Hoyer?
8158 2018-09-23 20:03:36 Only in US where planes are getting more efficient, oil prices drop, more passengers traveling but airlines increasing their prices to maximize profits #capitalism
8159 2018-09-23 20:03:20 This is why if I ever hear some white prick say something like "I refuse to apologize for creating the modern world" I will stick a funnel down his fucking throat and force feed him motor oil like I'm making foie gras.
8160 2018-09-23 20:02:53 Happy National Day to a Kingdom that
1. Gave me the best childhood (thanks to my parents obviously)
2. Has been home for the longest time
3. Gave me life long friends; some who became family
4. Spoiled us with abundant resources like oil, gas, food & shopping malls etc
.
8161 2018-09-23 20:02:43 I just need one more week Grayson. I gotta get my oil changed, tire fixed, car deep cleaned, car seat installed and bags packed. Then I’ll be all ready lol
8162 2018-09-23 20:02:35 This peppermint and tea tree oil conditioner got my scalp feeling so nice
8163 2018-09-23 20:02:34 Risa is a mind reader I swear. I used the last of my lavender essential oil last night and sure enough. Got a text this morning saying she’s making an order and asking what I want. What a doll.
8164 2018-09-23 20:02:33 Protip for adding years to your water heater: Google "anode rod" and find one at your local plumbing supply, not Lowe's or Home Depot.  It's like changing your car's oil. Do it once per 5 years.  Nobody's heard of it, apparently.
8165 2018-09-23 20:02:12 ummmm 
8166 2018-09-23 20:02:10 So what kind of dish would you prepare with pineapple sage infused cooking oil?
8167 2018-09-23 20:02:00 Which dosage are you using? Tried the oil but zero effect
8168 2018-09-23 20:02:00 Barry CANNOT accept the fact his snake oil sales pitch is losing its swag. Most people with a brain have finally realized he is a empty suit who gives a good speech.
8169 2018-09-23 20:01:58 coddy oil, sardines, central heating, sky collies are spoilt rotton......... when I were a lad...........

8173 2018-09-23 20:01:22 Hun this might be down to anxiety I get the same when my anxiety is really bad I find lavender oil on my pillow helps calm me

8175 2018-09-23 20:01:14 Do not even consider an equinox!!!  Horrible engine and excessive oil consumption problems!!$$$$
8176 2018-09-23 20:00:51 Infused cooking oil
8177 2018-09-23 20:00:41 Uhhh the oil industry kinda went downhill around the time global oil prices crashed because of market manipulation by the OPEC cartel
8178 2018-09-23 20:00:33 Sorry but I know you are trying to find a loophole but I have had warranty claims refused twice from 2 big manufacturers because of not being serviced at authorised dealers and using non manufacturers oil and parts. Plus i also lost money on a part exchange.

8182 2018-09-23 20:00:12 Me and Derek just had a fight about cooking oil....
8183 2018-09-23 20:00:06 Yes, motor oil is nutritious.
8184 2018-09-23 20:00:03 zingers about rapeseed oil. I don't understand the cupcake renaissance. If left untreated it can progress to degenerative allthumbrosis. I
8185 2018-09-23 19:59:53 rosemary olive oil bagel with scallion cream cheese. 
8186 2018-09-23 19:59:38 Changed my oil and got a MUCH needed a haircut. Feelin productive today FeelsGoodMan Clap
8187 2018-09-23 19:59:34 my boyfriend just called my CBD body butter "musky" and now I'm emptying my bottle of lavender oil in it 
8188 2018-09-23 19:59:12 It is time to transition into a coconut oil filled life
8189 2018-09-23 19:59:04 There wasn't another oil emoji!
8190 2018-09-23 19:59:03 But you’re sure down with picking internet fights with them. Are you 12?
8191 2018-09-23 19:58:47 از ساعت چهار ظهر تا همین الان اساسین بازی می کردم
8192 2018-09-23 19:58:39 I spent last winter tinkering & converting the cbr for track. Maybe I could change the fork oil or something. I’ve even got a wood burner & heat lamp in my man cave
8193 2018-09-23 19:58:38 the only thing that oil makes grow is the scammers salary sajdsajd
8194 2018-09-23 19:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8195 2018-09-23 19:58:36 And how is a standard oil type break up going to stop that?
8196 2018-09-23 19:58:34 this gonna sound dumb as hell. but if i add oil to my matte setting spray will it make it dewy???
8197 2018-09-23 19:58:32 Oh yeah gotta coat it in olive oil too before you bake, then dredge and fry
8198 2018-09-23 19:58:30 This day in history, a group of standard oil geologists from the United States arrives in Saudi Arabia, which helps the U.S. oil supply chain #HIST125007F18
8199 2018-09-23 19:58:24 Looking good. But when’s your olive oil back in stock? Been waiting a week....
8200 2018-09-23 19:58:06 Baby oil.
8201 2018-09-23 19:57:51 “I need an oil change my car sounds like sprinkler” 
8202 2018-09-23 19:57:42 Oilers are off to the power play.
8203 2018-09-23 19:57:42 Robes! Or aprons. Or things that don't require sizzling oil
8204 2018-09-23 19:57:34 did I intend to start crying at meijer bc i couldnt find the olive oil? no. did I do it anyways? yes, and it got worse when they started playing ariana grande 
8205 2018-09-23 19:57:32 Imposing sanctions on Iran, American oil producers cant produce beyond 11 millions barrels/day, Venezuela's produce is declining, increase global demand, 
All of these factors will increase the oil prices ultimately. OPEC is controlling the prices is not an accurate statement
8206 2018-09-23 19:57:30 If you have no passion or the oil to dance just sit down 
8207 2018-09-23 19:57:22 I have a dry mix (paprika, garlic and onion powder, parsley, cajun spice and adobo) with some olive oil. I let that sit for 24 hours (where possible) before i cook with veggies.
8208 2018-09-23 19:57:21 I've always used vege oil... Do you think that's where I've gone wrong?
8209 2018-09-23 19:57:19 More money!
8210 2018-09-23 19:57:08 Bhai bhakto se ek anurodh hai, dimak na ho to jabab na de. Are yar ye batao bike, scotter, tractor me daal chawal dalte ho kya. 
Oil price=transport=mahangai=wrong policy of govt.
Thoda mind Laga lo ho to.
8211 2018-09-23 19:57:01 I’ve got coconut oil and sunflower oil, which one should I use?
8212 2018-09-23 19:56:44 @tartecosmetics maracuja oil, it’s packed w vitamins & essential fatty acids & makes your face look amazing! I use it overnight, but you can also use it before primer & the rest of your makeup or by itself during the day. you can also use it in your hair, nail cuticles, body, etc
8213 2018-09-23 19:56:38 I know a lot about baby oil, 2 stroke oil but that's about it I'm afraid
8214 2018-09-23 19:56:34 Agreed. 
And this can be furthered by promoting the more moderate sects and helping them combat the oil backed Wahhabi's and others.

8218 2018-09-23 19:55:53 While we are still being distracted by a non issue led electioneering campaign leading to 2019, Porsche has just reminded Nigerians, that soon oil would most likely become less attractive to power automotives. The electric car revolution is real. We must divesify our economy.
8219 2018-09-23 19:55:51 Really poor meal at @swanatwalton tonight. Starter lovely as usual but the main was something else. Steak burnt on the outside and not cooked how we asked inside. Chips and onion rings swimming in grease and oil. Disappointed
8220 2018-09-23 19:55:43 Feeling kinda anxious so I’m gonna  get off social media and I’m going to be productive. I’m going to whack some coconut oil in my hair, put My Best Friend’s Wedding on & clean the flat from top to bottom 
8221 2018-09-23 19:55:42 pop like fish grease da flow get vicious #oil

8224 2018-09-23 19:55:31 If Muslims were not a people of Peace, why wouldn't they all have risen up and warred against Christians or Jewish people? Why would they still sell oil to western nations?
Its because they know better, they are more in tune with the realities of life!

8226 2018-09-23 19:55:20 Another disguised blessing today was failing to swallow my fish oil pill and realizing it tasted like Froot Loops
8227 2018-09-23 19:55:14 Such as thermo CLA pills or fish oil pills
8228 2018-09-23 19:54:50 Wondering when you learnt how to cook
8229 2018-09-23 19:54:49 Sera q da teto? Toma uns golão de oil
8230 2018-09-23 19:54:47 Have fun in the echo chamber run by oil companies that have actively been holding us all back.  You trust oil companies over scientists, that makes you the dumbass.  Have fun in the past watching the future pass you by.  Maybe you can yell at some kids on your lawn.
8231 2018-09-23 19:54:45 given that he has a lot of investments in oil and gas ill take what he has to say with a grain of salt.
8232 2018-09-23 19:54:35 Deciding how others should react based on your own experience is a faulty argument.
8233 2018-09-23 19:54:31 i fried like 3 and a half my oil finished had to use olive oil 
8234 2018-09-23 19:54:24 Future husband I want you to know that I can change buld, mount wall bracket for our , change oil and on the gen, and if nepa takes our fuse don't worry I gat us covered. 

I am also a good financial manager you can send money now and get it x 2 in future.
8235 2018-09-23 19:54:17 Yes and all that lovely oil and gas on the North Atlantic shelf
8236 2018-09-23 19:54:05 Would they dig around in the sewer or jump into a septic tank full of human waste? Would they work on an oil rig or in a power station or water treatment plant for no money? You are asking people to do these horrible and dangerous jobs for free.
8237 2018-09-23 19:53:46 I could never be a raw vegan because something very magical happens to plantain when you fry it bloodclaat Inna some oil.
8238 2018-09-23 19:53:43 Chal be... if you eat it you will know.. how hard it is to eat food loaded with ghee butter, coconut oil... 
8239 2018-09-23 19:53:39 Russians, NRA, Big Pharma, Gas and Oil, Health Ind.
Pick one. Or all.
8240 2018-09-23 19:53:25 Yeah, it’s crazy. Our car oil light came in while on holiday this year and I had no idea where the dipstick was, let alone the oil filler cap!
8241 2018-09-23 19:53:11 I tried taking a hot bath to help with cramps but I put a little coconut oil and lavender in so now I'm just slimy and i still have cramps

8244 2018-09-23 19:52:50 My first week in mzuzu a lady asked a shoprite attendant for Bushiris anointing oil..
8245 2018-09-23 19:52:44 And of course @jaketapper let her get away with that. Can you imagine if a republican elected official said this on @CNN?
8246 2018-09-23 19:52:24 @MMFlint proves one thing with his film. He cared more for snake oil salesman @BernieSanders than he did for Flint or for our country. Do you think that Hillary would have ignored Flint, that it would still be underserved? Never. Moore is anti-America, pro himself. #boycottMoore
8247 2018-09-23 19:52:23 Saudi will not give you crude oil
They will destroy your freedom
8248 2018-09-23 19:52:21 These would be the same oil companies like BP and Shell.  Both of whom are investing in EV charging and Shell who has just bought an electricity company. 
8249 2018-09-23 19:51:47 My mum used to force feed me the oil as a child. It's definitely bad
8250 2018-09-23 19:51:19 sjskskkskddk i was talking about an oil that makes boobs grow lol 
8251 2018-09-23 19:51:17 I'm in a theatre full of nerds yelling things at me like "sit down asshole" "stop talking over the movie" or "stop smearing popcorn oil on my son's face, it's getting in his eyes"
What a bunch a dorks!!
8252 2018-09-23 19:51:03 ม่วงอันนี้สวยมาก ไม่ม่วงเกินมีความชมพูหน่อย แนะนำว่าสีมันจะสดให้ทานิดเดียวและเบลนเอาน้าจะสวย
8253 2018-09-23 19:50:29 I have been blocked by @friendsoscience for pointing out their continuous around the clock tweeting and their obvious connections to oil companies.  They admit to corporate ties but will not say which corporations.
8254 2018-09-23 19:50:27 Woah, those leafy things look great!! Also remember, Bob Ross uses oil paints too if you decide to try and follow a tutorial :v
8255 2018-09-23 19:50:25 Oo try others. I use a vitamin e oil in the night time or even get an aloe vera plant and apply the gel at night. It dries like a mask then wash off in the morning
8256 2018-09-23 19:50:13 I have two THC oil pills... one is 50mg and the other is 100mg and they look identical... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ let’s play a game!!!

Dey also celebrate ISRAELI EXPENSION over Americans getting POOR & American LIVES LOST4 Israel. 4 Them Israel is AWAYS FIRST!!!

8265 2018-09-23 19:49:03 Note that I didn't say the collapse of oil production in Venezuala had nothing to do with Chavez, but that it's not about "big government" or "government monopolies". These things aren't inherently bad and can often be used well for national security or boosting the state budget.
8266 2018-09-23 19:48:59 Coconut oil, baby oil ....
8267 2018-09-23 19:48:57 Venezuela but without the oil.
8268 2018-09-23 19:48:51 I think our problem started when Nigeria discover crude oil , we abandon all our other mineral resources now the crude oil can't sustain our lifestyle we embark on loan which is very bad . Im not a fan of Rauf , Im was just commenting on Osun state election .
8269 2018-09-23 19:48:29 I use a silicone pan so it doesn't sizzle but I do put a drop of oil in to make them easy to get out.
8270 2018-09-23 19:48:23 It seems to me like raviolis wouldn't make very good friends with the oil.

Anyway, I dont feel the urge to fry anything at all since I dont fry stuff.

8274 2018-09-23 19:47:24 Glad Sears weighed in on your oil change situation
8275 2018-09-23 19:47:20 @KingSalman(4)
@Sara59703838, I know that their was a tme you all feed Iran food,  but what happened soon as that oil came in bringing cash they changed against you all. You know how I know that, I can see that in your hearts.  I am kind like that.
8276 2018-09-23 19:47:03 Wow - coal? That's interesting. (Though sounds dirty?) I have a friend who uses old cooking oil.  I agree on the battery size likely being the key.
8277 2018-09-23 19:46:52 It was 2 years ago he's all better now nothing severe, but yeah gotta be careful boiling oil. Glad you're okay!
8278 2018-09-23 19:46:44 I had a really bad martini once, I guess the bar didn't make them often. They put marinated olives into my drink, there was a slick of oil, crushed garlic  and oregano on the surface.
8279 2018-09-23 19:46:14 Kung magtatagalog ka pala at panig ka sa administration ni DU30 at against ka sa ML, pretentious ka na? Ang sukatan ba ng intelekwal ng isang tao ay mahusay sya sa English? Nasa Pinas ka, tafalog ang kausap mo, nag-English ka?
8280 2018-09-23 19:46:14 someone go take my car to get an oil change tomorrow for me pls
8281 2018-09-23 19:46:13 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8282 2018-09-23 19:46:08 The breadcrumbs in oil make a fish finger a sandwich as it is.
8283 2018-09-23 19:46:01 I bet Togata's skin is super clean and flake free, cause every time he drops through matter, all his dead skin and grease and oil just hit the floor or wall while he keeps going.
8284 2018-09-23 19:46:00 oooooh i had forgotten how amazing rosehip oil is for my skin  also note to self: buy some eyebrow dye asap
8285 2018-09-23 19:45:55 Conversely, if Alberta went nuclear for its power, and the companies in the oil sands used nuclear for electricity and steam generation that would massively reduce our provinces footprint AND still leave us as a major energy producer.
8286 2018-09-23 19:45:51 Old recipe I used to do years ago that's relatively healthy. Tin of chickpeas, little bit of oil, whatever seasoning you like such as chilli or curry spices spread on a baking tray and put in the oven.
8287 2018-09-23 19:45:28  i will find another way.
8288 2018-09-23 19:45:28 Is that pepper soup or too much oil
8289 2018-09-23 19:45:26 Gurney Goo works and also contains tea tree oil :)
8290 2018-09-23 19:45:16 Shell's much better than all the other oil companies; the principle stands, you can't judge an organization based on one individual.
8291 2018-09-23 19:45:11 $33 for olive oil, steak and coffee...that's it for just that what is this
8292 2018-09-23 19:45:08 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8293 2018-09-23 19:44:45 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!

8295 2018-09-23 19:44:23 India has reformed when pushed. Oil  and $ will push. Good that is happening. Will emerge stronger hope with modi ji else slightly delayed. But will still.

8297 2018-09-23 19:44:01 Ha!  Keep taking your snake oil, rube!
To me, you're the one who looks foolish.
8298 2018-09-23 19:43:44 Oil!
8299 2018-09-23 19:43:41 Great article and good points. Diversifying the economy is the only way to avoid the curse of the oil that has blighted the Middle East

8301 2018-09-23 19:43:32 I deep fried some perogies because why not. Threw them into a pot of oil and waited until they were golden brown. They taste just like perogies but harder.
8302 2018-09-23 19:43:30 No! It's basically a first. I might've had a migraine on other time, but nothing like this. 

After lots and lots of sleep, peppermint oil, hot bath, and more sleep, I'm actually feeling ok for now.
8303 2018-09-23 19:43:19 De försöker sälja ett statiskt system som elastiskt. Snake oil politicians.
8304 2018-09-23 19:42:57 Exactly, it's just strange that the only thing Dr. Ford remembers of any of this is the name which she hadn't even told her therapist & only until right before Kavanaugh Confirmation was the name ever mentioned. How do u remember that & nothing else?
8305 2018-09-23 19:42:57  wont gonna save you anything from my juniors
8306 2018-09-23 19:42:53 Heck yeah! Salad dressing is no way close to as delicious as vinegar and olive oil, for example, although I do put sriracha on everything. Black pepper is a great trick to bring out flavor too
8307 2018-09-23 19:42:53 I will! I only bought a couple things. I got the hallowmas body oil, and Rest in Peace bath bomb.
8308 2018-09-23 19:42:39 Sindh police bhi usko Shehad keh rahi thi. Cooking oil light yellow hota hay.
8309 2018-09-23 19:42:37 My first reaction: "Richard is not exactly ept."
On further reflection, he has a creditable openness.
Labour wants to keep Scotland for oil and Labour MP's.
Tories want to keep Scotland for oil and cannon fodder.
Lib dems need Jo and Tavish.
So we know what we're worth.
8310 2018-09-23 19:42:36 Again , I feel like crap that it happened to you ; but , you DID remember enough to be taken seriously and ANYONE can see that .     You can't honestly say that you can read Dr. Ford's account and come away with the same sentiment.
8311 2018-09-23 19:42:32 No one is allowed to fly without a license. Even students are licensed. That’s not what the editorial is advocating. They’re advocating you prove your license is current with each flight. Even if you’re taking off from a rural grass strip or an oil platform.
8312 2018-09-23 19:42:19 Oil Refinery for which the foundation stone was already laid by UPA Govt, has once again been inaugurated by PM Modi Raje and delayed by 5 years.This has delayed the income or made a loss of at least rupees 5000 cr to the State Exchequer #RajeRuinedRajasthan for her false ego.

8314 2018-09-23 19:41:08 The teen wants something from me. Evidence: 1) Generally happy & upbeat. 2) trimmed hedges & did an oil change without being told. 3) apologized for tracking dirt in the house and assured it would be cleaned. These are atypical behaviors, It's a trap!!

8321 2018-09-23 19:39:06 Omg fries are dangerous be careful lmao, my dad did this once when he was alone and the kitchen caught fire, God knows how he managed to put it out. He burnt his head and arms a bit though from the popping oil. Cooking is scary at times
8322 2018-09-23 19:38:57 I'm an Oil and Water guy
8323 2018-09-23 19:38:52 Pilgner is not a unbiased voice on this issue.
If it was under false pretexts, what did America gain from such a large loss of blood and treasure?
If it was all about oil, America did a bad job of getting the oil.
8324 2018-09-23 19:38:48 And we are all buying oil from these primates! What a stupid belief. I really do feel bad for the women and children of the savages.
8325 2018-09-23 19:38:45 Take some EPA/DHA supplements they improve memory! make sure they aren’t fish oil, those are polluted and have other bad fats! take algae derived EPA/DHA
8326 2018-09-23 19:38:44 Don’t actually need more power stations. Go read the national grid information on it. Seriously just go read up on it before quoting all the oil industry memes.
8327 2018-09-23 19:38:41 CBD oil has helped my mom decrease her opioid medications. It's been a miracle as far as I'm concerned.
8328 2018-09-23 19:38:37 We had one left in a (man-made, from a quarry) lake for about a month, after poorly dealing with the reeds. I called Dept Fish & Game and said the thing has got to be leaking oil all over the fishies and ducks. They took care of it, thankfully.
8329 2018-09-23 19:38:34 @afowler06.. I know you use CBD oil. I've got nerve damage in my neck and shoulder and want to try it. Do you think the oil that I  can buy from Holland Barrett would be OK to try. Cheers Pal

8332 2018-09-23 19:38:07 In a capitalist society someone’s lust for riches comes by serving his fellow man. Look at John d Rockefeller... became richest man in history by LOWERING the price of oil from 80 cents to 5 cents. Competition and a system of income inequality has raised everyone’s standards.
8333 2018-09-23 19:38:05 I've never tried it haha I'm a boring face mask/oil user
8334 2018-09-23 19:37:35 What can you expect from a non credible @PMOIndia it’s obvious he doesn’t know the math given ridiculous claims on the success on demonetization and is unable to manage oil prices which he earlier claimed (wrongly again) to have well managed? ‘ably’ assisted by @arunjaitley
8335 2018-09-23 19:37:32 #EcoFact:In 2016 the number of U.S. jobs in #solarenergy overtook those in #fossilfuel extraction for the first time – #solarjobs grew 12 times faster than overall job creation. In China, there are 35 percent more people working in #cleanenergy than in #oil and #gas.
8336 2018-09-23 19:37:09 I know lol he must have been sniffing some virgin oil whilst tweeting 
8337 2018-09-23 19:36:50 Something else they “endorse” like commercial slaughter for fur and “sustainable” palm oil is krill (that whales eat) I don’t believe that is sustainable either. You get the feeling after knowing all this that it might just be rotten to the core
8338 2018-09-23 19:36:48 2/2 China & Russia also obstacles? The world is sick of unilaterali$$m. U.S. oil production is indeed up but for how long? It's no fluke it has illegal military bases in oil/gas areas in Syria. Iran incites violence in Iraq? Rather, ISIS spawned after U.S. intervened!

8344 2018-09-23 19:36:11 Yep, I worked in a few garages before I settled down and really got productive, those were the days. Now I pay a mechanic to change my oil, and tip cash. I tip Tim Hortons servers too, as they put up with the worst.

mine was...
-bunkering of MGO till 1AM
-woke up really early on a sunday to clean the whole engine room before technical superintendent comes.
-bunkering of heavy fuel and lube oil
-provision 10+ palets (with spare) prepping for ASIA travels.
8351 2018-09-23 19:35:10 Absolutely, we also have more than most other oil producing countries.
8352 2018-09-23 19:35:08 Coconut oil. That’s it. That’s the tweet.
8353 2018-09-23 19:35:04 Imagine how pissed you would be if you had to wait till dinosaurs turn to oil.
8354 2018-09-23 19:34:50 have state run oil. You really should read up on this stuff rather than just repeating talking points before you espouse your views to others. Bernie wants a Nordic model, & those countries are happier, healthier economies, healthier people, better eduction, less debt..
8355 2018-09-23 19:34:38 Are you making seasoned oil?
8356 2018-09-23 19:34:37 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

8365 2018-09-23 19:33:30 The larger concern is not the price of oil, but our lack of capacity for creating petroleum distillates.
8366 2018-09-23 19:33:24 Went there for jojoba oil while high as a kiiiiite, left with kale chips and no jojoba oil 
8367 2018-09-23 19:33:21 Even just the mustard vegetable and chili oil 
8368 2018-09-23 19:33:20 Pro tip: any time you’re making a box cake mix, brownie mix, cookies, or anything like that... Replace the vegetable oil with butter! It’s much better that way, I promise!!
8369 2018-09-23 19:33:15 Use our own oil.

8378 2018-09-23 19:32:41 Goddamned. There is nothing good about palm oil.  Its greed is killing the environment (rainforests and orangutans) and and the oil itself is unhealthy.  The root of all evil.

8384 2018-09-23 19:32:05 Yes! Once. I didn’t get it exactly but it’s totally possible and totally delicious and easy! Just need the right ingredients!  You can get pretty far with some chopped pickled mustard vegetable, beef broth, light soy sauce and a jar of crunchy chili oil stuff

8386 2018-09-23 19:31:31 I love rosehip oil. I usually use it in my pm routine after I cleanse and tone

8388 2018-09-23 19:31:11 Stop this madness. This is maddening. We’re befriending Russia, North Korea, and trying to annihilate Iran. God help us if this is all about oil.

8401 2018-09-23 19:30:00 We've got to stop drilling for oil and start drilling an even bigger hole right through the centre of the earth, letting cool air flow through and bringing the temperature down

8416 2018-09-23 19:28:40 To complete the circle: Iran’s customers are telling State Dept they need the oil about to be sanctioned. The US is telling them to call Saudi Arabia.

8425 2018-09-23 19:27:35 With the risk of NAFTA falling through, Canada would have to refine all of its oil it's self or pay more to refine it in the US. Right now there is a clause that requires Canada to send oil to the US, get refined and sent back to Canada. This works great when there's no tarif

8444 2018-09-23 19:25:12 HEADS UP to people who've purchased from my shop, I realized there was an ingredient that I had left off the list for certain soaps.  Most of my soaps contain small amounts of sweet almond oil, which some people with tree nut allergies have a sensitivity to.
8445 2018-09-23 19:25:00 We back out of OPEC! And start heavily producing Oil&gas a flood the mkt
8446 2018-09-23 19:24:40 I do this as well. Put some warm olive oil on cotton wool and place in ear. Don't know why it works but definitely soothes the pain.
8447 2018-09-23 19:24:32 You mean the California where the cost of oil products is at its highest? Even electric cars would need petroleum products. Never mind the cost for electricity out there even though they buy most of what they need. Even our hydro dams require petroleum products.

8462 2018-09-23 19:22:46 The last straw - trump’s asking OPEC to flood our market with cheaper oil (and destroy our domestic industry) is same as asking China for more cheap goods to suppress our instrial/manufacturing capacity - the man is an idiot - nothing is thought through carefully - a fool -

8468 2018-09-23 19:22:00 Geostrategy!! They want cheap oil!! But our president decided not to use, or let you guys explore our natural resources! We know you! Greedy people! Now they want to come and give lessons like they will care more abt Cameroon than their country!!

8470 2018-09-23 19:20:58 Everything was nuclear powered when the oil ran out and I suspect a lot of stuff in FO is meant to be ironic dark humor more than strict, logical canon.
8471 2018-09-23 19:20:45 Ah. Like round here. Except here the local ‘wildlife’ consists of screeching owls, farmers shooting rabbits, and ne’erdowells stealing heating oil.

8487 2018-09-23 19:18:49 Oil is a renewable. The best one Canada has at this time.
8488 2018-09-23 19:18:35 2% global emission is just one way to look at things( a tp denialists or do nithongs are wedded to). Canada is also among the world's top 5 oil & gas producers. We arn't responsible for global demand or our export down stream emissions, but Cada is definitely part of the problem.
8489 2018-09-23 19:18:21 going further you could say a great deal of the US empire is busy defending oil companies.

thorium and sea water are everywhere and therefore impossible to hoard. once #moltensaltreactor tech is available we might have civilization again
8490 2018-09-23 19:18:10 They are rushing there because you plundered all what Africa had and you're still plundering.

8605 2018-09-23 19:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
8606 2018-09-23 19:02:24 Does your car need an oil change every 3 days?
8607 2018-09-23 19:02:19 Sharing oil money every month has imparted negatively on Nigeria economic growth Restructuring the political economy will enhance higher economic activities for all Nigerians and promote higher growth rate and productivity Nigeria and Angola which produce oil are not in nos1-10
8608 2018-09-23 19:02:09 Happy Sunday everyone!! The kink party I went to last night was a blast. Got to try my hand in massaging someone in hot oil from a candle
8609 2018-09-23 19:01:47 I just cant wait to have my own kids and give them caster oil and brooklux 
8610 2018-09-23 19:01:47 Oh! I plan on coloring it myself too! I just need to do a coconut oil mask before I bleach, but I'll be going pink next.

Please give me money!

8620 2018-09-23 19:00:02 You just use the people of this country to further your own agenda you snake oil salesman.

The people you claim to represent have nothing to gain from #Brexit & everything to lose. Many of them are now seeing through your lies and your #brexit fantasy is moribund.

8621 2018-09-23 18:59:52 “You ever hear the story about the drop of oil in an ocean?”
8622 2018-09-23 18:59:37 I always imagine that you have a room filled with reams of your own jotted recipes for salads and beard oil ;) #gdnbloggers
8623 2018-09-23 18:59:26 I put way too much chili oil into my Raman and now im regretting life. It hurts so good 
8624 2018-09-23 18:59:06 baby oil to loosen the glue from the hair.. a little on your finger tip. lot of massaging
8625 2018-09-23 18:59:03 Who said we need you you guys buy our oil alright but our economy doesn’t depend on you, by 2030 we wouldn’t need you as much, you will.
8626 2018-09-23 18:58:59 Most people don’t even know it was this oil from the US that blew up our town in Canada! Had it been a train full of Fort Mac Bitumen there never would’ve been an explosion lol the crap would have sealed any cracks in the railcars 
8627 2018-09-23 18:58:58 real bitches aren’t afraid of hot oil in a frying pan... it’s not me i’m not real bitches
8628 2018-09-23 18:58:14 You’re welcome! I mixed mine with cocoa butter formula and had no stretch marks but now that I’m more natural I would do this: melt coconut oil and real cocoa butter (from health food store) in a bowl that’s sitting in boiling water and add vitamin e, let it cool, store and apply
8629 2018-09-23 18:58:10 Really? UK needs that much oil?
8630 2018-09-23 18:58:02 Electric trucks would solve that problem easily. Solar roadways would make moving goods easier, cheaper, and less dangerous. Oil doesn't produce crops; sun and rain and labour do. Tractors and plows help, but no one said we had to shut them down. And climate change kills crops.
8631 2018-09-23 18:57:57 Rosehip oil is my JAAAAAAMMMMM. I literally bathe my face in it every night
8632 2018-09-23 18:57:50 Yes contra that with bailing out Scottish Banks by UK Gov. 
Venezuela too has oil  ....see how well Socialism works there.
8633 2018-09-23 18:57:32 I need to get my oil changed lol
8634 2018-09-23 18:57:26    keep it as top secret
8635 2018-09-23 18:57:22 My oil? Are you ok? Your hardly out drunk celebrating an underage win are ye?
8636 2018-09-23 18:56:51 Hi ha una cosa anomenada peak oil basada en la teoría de Marion Hubert segons la qual al 2006 es va aconseguir el màxim de petroli que mai s'aconseguirà, a partir d'aquí tot fa baixada.
El petroli que queda costa més de treure i és més dolent.
8637 2018-09-23 18:56:50 Hate it when that happens! Sesame oil or any oil you have on hand.
8638 2018-09-23 18:56:45 It's mainly for the oil though
8639 2018-09-23 18:56:30 I am fairly sure that I am going to have to learn to drive (if not for UK jobs then oil field work in Canada) before I can get another tattoo, which ruins my plans of many tattoos under trans black suit pics :P
8640 2018-09-23 18:56:17 lavender tea and lavender oil diffuser for today's late evening. 

I gotta finally descale this thing though because the mist is really crappy lol
8641 2018-09-23 18:56:11 It’s too bad you never show compassion to strangers in clemency hearings to have Floridians’ voter rights restored.

The shamelessness and the selfishness with which you sell snake oil with every syllable that comes out of your mouth is reprehensible.
8642 2018-09-23 18:56:01 get the baby oil

Me: I'll take some spark plugs and an oil filter please.

8646 2018-09-23 18:55:43 Opec doesn't set the prices. The hedge funds & oil traders are the ones to blame for pushing up the price of oil like Goldman Sachs, Glencore & @EnergyPhilFlynn
8647 2018-09-23 18:55:40 Israel-Greece-Cyprus, Powerful! Together we will conquer all of Europe with gas and oil ..!
8648 2018-09-23 18:54:57 STUPID MOVE @SecPompeo @AmbJohnBolton.

As a refugee bc of Islamic Revolution, I know US has been desperate for the past century to control Iran & its oil.

The strongest Middle East democracy was in Iran in 1950s. US overthrew it & installed a puppet who was himself overthrown.
8649 2018-09-23 18:54:48 Do you want a light oil or something heavier that’ll give a little hold?
8650 2018-09-23 18:54:40 The clarifying shampoo tho is cheap!! It helps get rid of all build up oil so your hair and stay healthier wwww.
8651 2018-09-23 18:54:39 Pink oil moisturizer 
8652 2018-09-23 18:54:13 One of the reasons I don’t support soda taxes. Maybe they reduce soda consumption but granting govt the power to tax foods it deems bad is very dangerous IMO. What’s to stop a meat tax? Or a butter tax? Or coconut oil tax? Once the precedent is set—nothing.
8653 2018-09-23 18:54:13 The recently started Telecom company Jio was named such that it is a mirror image of Oil (their primary revenue stream)!
8654 2018-09-23 18:54:10 Cheap oil talks good.
8655 2018-09-23 18:54:07 Congrats.
- i would do seabuckthorn seed oil capsules, a few per day
- others say topical tamanu oil helps scars
- scars take ~1 year to finalize. See plastic surgery or wound healing textbooks. (Altho texts won't mention tamanu or seabuckthorn, bcuz no big pharma $ in it.)

8662 2018-09-23 18:52:49 Ooh. Lol I disagree compared to other chicken places their strips are 10/5 to other processed strips and they actually do bread theirs each day. So idk maybe it’s the oil or something you don’t like, I know I do think they taste a lot better when they first come out. Not cold.

8669 2018-09-23 18:51:24 Ford wants to eliminate Ontario’s greenhouse gas targets, the cap and trade system, and the programs it funded — without anything to replace them.

He wants to line the pockets of the oil and gas industry, while trashing jobs in Ontario’s growing renewable energy sector.

8673 2018-09-23 18:51:02 Disappointed to hear security cons are now selling their names to Big Oil. :-(

But really awesome that your workshop went well!
8674 2018-09-23 18:50:47 Wait.... I thought the world was going to run out of oil in 1975 and the land where my house now sits was going to be under 25ft of water in 1992?

8677 2018-09-23 18:50:15 I thought rosehip oil was comedogenic!
8678 2018-09-23 18:50:05 James 5:14 

Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

8681 2018-09-23 18:49:59 You people are still pushing that lie? The studies that argument has been based on has been proven, multiple times, to have not only took equal work into account(IE same jobs) bit it doesn't even account for work hours or high risk payment jobs like oil rig workers.
8682 2018-09-23 18:49:55 Just got a oil change. My car feels delicious 
8683 2018-09-23 18:49:54 Started my day off by accidentally dropping HOT frying oil in my right eye
8684 2018-09-23 18:49:48 That between soap and oil, one is a by product of the other. Or sth to that effect

8690 2018-09-23 18:48:59 Not compared to the level of subsidies and rock bottom tax rates on fossil fuels. The public cost per oil job is obscene. 
If we "drain" Alberta the climate wont be able to support human life anymore. Our existing output is already a threat to our survival.

8695 2018-09-23 18:48:15 A country that doesn’t have gas,oil,coal you need only one to start the ball rolling my guess someone will pick a reactor design they like and a half dozen to a dozen countries will adopt it and economies of scale kick in
8696 2018-09-23 18:47:41 ??? What, I thought this dude was all American only, but I guess there is this equivalent of arms for oil maybe or other trades?

8701 2018-09-23 18:47:14 @airwickus I recently purchased an Air Wick Essential Oil Diffuser Mist Kit and it is defective. The diffuser makes this extremely obnoxious high pitched noise whenever it goes off and it does not produce a scent. So disappointed! 
8702 2018-09-23 18:47:09 I know, I know.. Let me think about.. The one on The oil/ energy market, removing our regulations is easy for me. Along with our current real estate market in the commercial world, how global money has moved from back to the U.S., and construction and rebuilding is up.
8703 2018-09-23 18:46:46 Nice & happy in my room reading, Vegan walls in, “got any oregano oil, I have bug bites.”  Yeah, over there.  Sits down, puts it on, stinks up my room to high heaven, walks out.
Yeah, thanks honey... 
8704 2018-09-23 18:46:39 Con la Fiat Toro demostró que no sirve para nada... es sólo una camioneta para ciudad además de los problemas que tiene con el DPF y que se llena de gas oil el aceite del motor...
Nissan, Renault y Mercedes salen de la misma fábrica a competir.
8705 2018-09-23 18:46:38 how do you just have hypericum oil? that's so awesome. can't be helped, that sometimes even you can't handle your hotness XD. that is definitely the better choice. glad it's all eased up.
8706 2018-09-23 18:46:28 I would of said magnesium oil or magnesium flakes for the bath as it helps relax muscles and eat plenty of protein to help muscle recovery.
8707 2018-09-23 18:46:28 Dad got me an oil change and now he’s putting new brakes in my car. Dads r awesome.

8709 2018-09-23 18:45:45 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
8710 2018-09-23 18:45:32 Happy for the result, astounded we still have such stupid barriers.  You can medicate kids nonstop with mind altering, mood altering drugs and send them to school (almost encouraged in some instances)... but cannibas  oil we draw the line at.  So happy for this young lady
8711 2018-09-23 18:45:31 Olive oil /butter with some oregano is nice too on hot bread
8712 2018-09-23 18:45:19 I sold my baby to buy baby oil
8713 2018-09-23 18:45:13 I took it more to mean "snake oil early adopter"
8714 2018-09-23 18:45:12 If you use lush skincare... any of their face moisturizers work well. If you can find it, Moroccan oil has some oils that work nicely for beards. Ouai has a good hair/body oil, and a rose scented one. Dphue has a hair/body oil too.
8715 2018-09-23 18:44:53 Looks delicious 
8716 2018-09-23 18:44:53 Baby Oil Sex Is So Different OMFG ya too young to understand
8717 2018-09-23 18:44:46 Don't know if I can ever go back to using body creams. This oil life is sweet. But it isn't harmattan friendly
8718 2018-09-23 18:44:43 Fried rice
Boil d rice for 10mins
Pour vegetable oil in a pot leave it for 2mins and pour green bean, sweet corn, carrot, pepper, curry, maggi, inside d vegetable oil and stir 2gether 4 like 10min
Pour d boiled rice inside d oil and leave it to steam for 6 to 8mins
Eat ur food
8719 2018-09-23 18:44:41 With body oil too?
8720 2018-09-23 18:44:39 It’s the people that make all the difference. 9G8 is another great one. Flew in there many times to visit in-laws in Lilly. One time, I needed oil, but had no cash. Guy hands me a container and says, “don’t worry about it; you can pay next time.”
8721 2018-09-23 18:44:38 It was obvious in so many former “commonwealth” countries when they tried to escape from the UK empire. Odd as “common wealth” was anything but, as the generators of wealth saw no fruits of their work, which was stolen, as with North Sea oil proceeds, and forcibly in most cases!
8722 2018-09-23 18:44:34 Home sweet home! Oil change didn’t take forever n a day like usual
8723 2018-09-23 18:44:21 Rafael was without fuel tank and tyres the team found out and included the fuel tank and tyres in prices that's why price has been increased to triple.
 For service irfaan mechanic was there to service and oil change .now more sophisticated Mr AMBANI has been given the job.
8724 2018-09-23 18:44:17 I'm doing:
1) No alcohol
2) Minimize sugar (special treats only). No "low-fat" anything. Low-fat == high sugar.  
3) Reduce bread.
4) Embrace fat/butter.  I'm putting butter on everything including my coffee (along with MCT oil)!
8725 2018-09-23 18:44:14 I love arrogant western centric news. There’s a terrorist attack in Iran in which kids are killed but the focus becomes how bad the Iranians are. Perhaps the US shouldn’t have removed President Mosaddegh in 1953 to safeguard oil. Imagine the democracy it could have been today.
8726 2018-09-23 18:44:09 I can’t put you on to my oil man- Classic
8727 2018-09-23 18:43:40 .....I’ve never tried olive oil either
8728 2018-09-23 18:43:34 The classic “clean this up” lol.  This cleanup is worse than an oil slick in the ocean.

"Do they ?"

"Why don't you check these things ?"

"Why don't you learn to iron ?"

8734 2018-09-23 18:42:51 The lush cream doesn’t work! Try get Kalms Night tablets- they’re all herbal, no medicine- made from flowers and they work! Als try lavender oil on your pillow and around your room! 
8735 2018-09-23 18:42:42 Klo ada yg judge itu, ini jawabanku. Gini loh nggak bisa semuanya dilihat hitam putih. Dunia ini butuh minyak kelapa sawit. Belum ada veg oil yg tinggi produktifitasnya bisa menyamai klapa sawit. Klo diganti minyak dr biji bunga matahari butuh lahan yg lebih luas lg.....
8736 2018-09-23 18:42:42 I meant olive oil not straight olives
I don’t eat straight olives
8737 2018-09-23 18:42:29 a bunch of fucking idiots work at Walmart I swear, don't ever take your car there for an oil change

8740 2018-09-23 18:41:52 @narendramodi what your opinion about oil price?leave state government and take it to GST.. This is very big issue to lose election.. Thank you. Good night.

8742 2018-09-23 18:41:50 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8746 2018-09-23 18:41:21 Iran is Saudi Arabia's enemy and we should be.
Oil is the problem.
We cannot admit that Saudi Arabia did the nasty
deed on 9/11.  
But they did !
8747 2018-09-23 18:41:14 As many ordinary Americans are already squandering their pennies per week tax cut on luxuries like food, they may struggle to keep heat on this winter since oil prices have risen 40% in the past year.  Why?  Trump wants to sell the Saudis arms so they can kill children in Yemen.
8748 2018-09-23 18:41:01 Good! That’s what I was hoping to see. On my third or fourth Craftsman adjustable oil filter wrench. Locking spring tends to wear out.
8749 2018-09-23 18:40:52 Tbh any face oil works. If you want to go 100% natural, avocado oil works well, coconut oil too. Shea butter can be nice too. Most professional haircare brands have beard oils. Redken, clubman have one. Verbs ghost oil works well.
8750 2018-09-23 18:40:42 Fox News Anchors know that when the 45th president spews nonsense, a sad wolf prays for help #resist
8751 2018-09-23 18:40:40 Equality is the most bogus snake oil one can sell. Each individual differs in abilities & propensities. No one is equal.
8752 2018-09-23 18:40:36 You're not protecting them, you're protecting your own interests (access to their oil). You have zero leverage.

8765 2018-09-23 18:39:19 Yes. Bergantung pada oxidation or hydrogenation yang berlaku pada oil akan alter freezing point oil. Contohnya margerin akan cair bila kita panaskan and akan jadi solid balik ke bentuk asal bila sejukkan.

8768 2018-09-23 18:38:38 I am glad you brought this out. I am in a Dietetics program and I wish that people understood that coconut oil isn't "the healthiest" oil. This doesn't mean we can't eat it. It just means that if you are wanting to use the healthiest oil, you should use an unsaturated source.

8772 2018-09-23 18:38:07 I’m not against KM. I’m actually for the replacement of a 65 year old pipeline with conditions. I’m more worried about the old line leaking, than a brand new one. You shouldn’t label or lump together an oil conservationist with an anti pipeline activist.

8775 2018-09-23 18:37:50 I had the most oily skin until I started using angels on bare skin from lush, the oil and and scrub from the almonds is soooo amazing and had balanced my skin. Along with that, drinking the proper amount of water and eating hydrating foods had balanced my skin. Good luck!

8782 2018-09-23 18:36:42 No doubt HAL has come a long way but I guess the question is retrofitting entire production config to suit Rafale. e.g. Oil processing plants in India are tuned to process only oil from specific countries&can't switch easily. Thats 1 thing cntry is battling with US
8783 2018-09-23 18:36:39 Simple? I spent nearly 30 years in international corporate life in Oil&Gas - there’s nothing simple about international tax laws except the principle. After that it’s complicated.

8796 2018-09-23 18:35:13 My boyfriend wanted to be nice and make us dinner, and I love him for it. But he used so much oil in the sauce so I couldn’t have any, but he mixed the meat with the sauce so even tho I tried to not get any sauce I did and now I’m legit crying over some oil smh

8809 2018-09-23 18:33:06 It is no trump card at all...Canadian oil has basically one market, the USA, hence the $30.00 per barrel discount, we have no increased access to tidewater to change due to the current pipeline fiasco and you can be sure Trump knows that.

8812 2018-09-23 18:32:32 Is it oil rich or something? Is it on top of some easily exploited minerals?!
8813 2018-09-23 18:32:28 Look up hard tack or rock candy recipe. I use 2 cups sugar, 1 cup water and 2/3 cups karo syrup. 7-10 grams of finely ground decarbed bud(grind fine, bake at 235 for an hour). Add bud directly to boiling sugar water. 6 drops cinnamon oil and red food coloring.

8869 2018-09-23 18:25:10 So from 1939 to June 1941 the Soviet Union sold oil, food etc to Germany in exchange for military equipment, ships, designs etc. If Hitler had not been a crazy nutter he would have continued with this trade deal indefinitely whilst crushing Britain and the USA.

8881 2018-09-23 18:23:47 That almost works with China, it makes no sense with Russia, the only thing they have is oil and that industry is dying/will die soon and if they continue pushing oil aggressively there is a good chance the 60% of The Russian Federation that is permafrost will melt into the sea
8882 2018-09-23 18:23:42 The day I put oil in my hair is the day everybody wants to be touching it.

What do you call the white paper 

Remind me the oil price ?
8898 2018-09-23 18:22:10 OK, Chloe, here’s some history. In 1939 Germany wanted to go to war with Poland and potentially the U.K. and France. But it was worried about running out of vital supplies like oil, food etc. So it signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union which included A TRADE DEAL!!
8899 2018-09-23 18:22:08 I use olive oil and butter for most everything. Caveats: I add a bit of coconut oil when I barbecue chicken. I use MCT oil in my coffee. Premium olive oil is the best for the stove and for sauces.  Don’t neglect the fats from meats, too 
8900 2018-09-23 18:21:46 Lol. Mainly just leave it alone, use good beard oil every other day and find a good barber to keep it in check.

8908 2018-09-23 18:21:08 The war in Yemen is very costly for SA, and not successful so far. will cause big deficits in SA budget, and will have reflection on world oil markets. Has potential to create tectonic changes in Middle East, and  maybe even destruction of SA & petro dollar system...

8911 2018-09-23 18:19:46 No. You are an asshole yelling at clouds to line his own pocket. A greedy money man. Do you sleep clutching your cheque book too? Since you appear to come from the mid east are you perhaps invested in the oil and gas industry? Threatened by the advent on electric cars perhaps?
8912 2018-09-23 18:19:24 Baby oil!
8913 2018-09-23 18:19:10 Dry-sauteeing mushrooms.
No oil/butter needed. 
1) Briefly heat pan over medium heat. Throw in rinsed or wiped shrooms. They'll spit out liquid. 
2) Stir occasionally.
3) When liquid evaporates, shrooms are usually done.
Flavor is intense. What mushrooms should taste like.

8933 2018-09-23 18:16:00 oil. Look Iraq. Look at its assets before the war and invasion, and look at its assets now. Same with libya. Look at its assets before the war and invasion, and look at its assets now. Where are they? Also look at the territorial map. What happens if you subdivide it?
8934 2018-09-23 18:15:59 Most #wars in our generations have been about #oil. There may be a new @alternativeenergy source called Helium3. Also, it explains #Trump's space fleet announcement, it's on the #moon. "a single spaceship filled with the material could supply all of USA energy needs for one year"
8935 2018-09-23 18:15:58 Husband went to a “drive event” for a super car yesterday and I’m thankful they told him an oil change is $1200, which seemed ludicrous even to him.

8944 2018-09-23 18:14:57 With shale oil we have more than enough reserves. America one of the few Countries who can be energy independent. When we went into to Iraq we didn’t take their oil. We gave the Country back; their oil as well.
8945 2018-09-23 18:14:50 Patrick Mahomes is operating at like 75 percent efficiency today — probably just needs an oil change — and is still unbelievable.

8950 2018-09-23 18:14:08 Gotta say, just watched the GGG v Canelo fight for a 3rd time & little changed. Gave Alvarez one more round but still had Golovkin taking last 4 rds and winning 115-113. No question it was close but the champ can't lose a fight like that on the cards.

9009 2018-09-23 18:05:01 As oil windfall dwindles new ways to keep politicians presiding over our collective future are being explored and as always oversight appears to be an afterthought as we fall well short on revenue goals and exceed both foreign and domestic borrowing!

9018 2018-09-23 18:02:47 Animal savers, would it help if we spread a little coconut oil on a stuck critter first, to help them slide out? It seems like that could make it easier. Asking for future reference.
9019 2018-09-23 18:02:45 signs of winter in a vegan household: Meg bounds out from the kitchen to announce "its cold! the coconut oil has solidified!"
9020 2018-09-23 18:02:35 So, sniffing oil also causes some sort of paranoia Gilles? Who are you afraid of? Try smoking weed instead
9021 2018-09-23 18:02:33 In Filipino/Tagalog we don’t say “You got what you deserved” we say “Ginisa ka sarili mong mantika” which roughly translates to “You got fried in your own oil” and that amuses me and makes me hungry at the same time.
9022 2018-09-23 18:02:31 Feels like my knee’s r being held together with a couple of nuts & bolts.

9026 2018-09-23 18:01:44 Ukno it’s time to whip out the winter jacket when your coconut oil gets solid
9027 2018-09-23 18:01:41  and what’s up with the rosehip oil??
9028 2018-09-23 18:01:37 Really glad you are buying you fuels from the less ethical US side of the boarder or importing raw oil for refining from Russia.
9029 2018-09-23 18:01:35 Would messaging some sweet almond oil with a few  drops of lavender essential oil help?

9035 2018-09-23 18:00:57 A little drizzle of sesame oil might help. I’m not a big fan either. Hope that’s not riceist!

9039 2018-09-23 18:00:47 Yeah like OPEC didn't manipulate oil prices prior to Trump becoming president and tweeting. Trump should tweet that the sanctions on Iran just got 30% worse.
9040 2018-09-23 18:00:44 60%.. Wow. I definitely agree that it should be kept in the UK, obviously. But aren't people arguing that we should be importing during the energy transition and not producing any oil or gas of our own? In which case the tax isn't 30% (which you say is low), but is 0%...?

It tastes like tramps-arse, but it is better for tooth pain than any other pain-killer you can buy. Seriously. The revolting taste is worth it.

9123 2018-09-23 17:46:09 Hi Myron, thanks for your comments. I’ll re-listen to the recording, sounds like our wording may have been bad. I know the process pretty well. Fracking is post-drilling; DUC wells have many steps before actually producing oil incl. installing pumping equipment.

9161 2018-09-23 17:41:03 Hope you all are having a great Sunday! I am watching a bit of football here. 
Let me know if you have any questions on CBD oil.
Remember to add anyone you feel would be interested in or could benefit from using to my CBD Life group.
9162 2018-09-23 17:40:45 yeah, use something like A&D ointment or coconut oil works fine too, vaseline is just heavy as shit lmao

9164 2018-09-23 17:40:26 @ImranKhanPTI Minerals resources of pakistan must be explored under supervision of Dr.Qadir like patriot people. There are some obnoxious faces who take bribe from neighboring countries and seal the wells forever with lead. V need clear and deadly honest supervisors n oil and gas
9165 2018-09-23 17:40:22 Castor oil might be good for your little downstairs problem.

9169 2018-09-23 17:40:02 They have a blue on. Sensitive skin but it will strip all the oil
9170 2018-09-23 17:40:01 Currently we do not have a melting pot. It's more of an oil and water situation. And instead of a melting pot, think of us as a stew where we maintain our distinctness but are part of the same pot/meal.

Yeah... China ke bhikh pe chal rahe ho jo FATF ho ya BRICS latiya k chal deta hai
9174 2018-09-23 17:39:34 This oil discussion LMAOOOOOOO
9175 2018-09-23 17:39:27 Forgot I had my essential oil diffuser on and thought for a second a ghost was materializing in my room and that I was the next Long Island medium
9176 2018-09-23 17:39:20 @BulldogSkincare love your shave oil but actually extracting the oil out the bottle is a nightmare, is there a recommended technique?
9177 2018-09-23 17:39:14 Coconut oil maybe
9178 2018-09-23 17:39:14 [me working in a health food shop]
Customer: evening primrose oil?

Me: Good evening, but it’s Mark to you
9179 2018-09-23 17:39:10 With the caveat that we aren't cremated just make a mass grave for future oil deposits to happen. Such caring. Much forethought.
9180 2018-09-23 17:38:45 She did give that option in her instagram caption. Made the oil free version as part of my meal prep this week, mashed.
9181 2018-09-23 17:38:41 I avoided rx w/paleo. Didn't lose much weight, was sensitive to carbs spiking glucose.

I went WFPB no oil, I lost 50 pounds, my A1C went down from 7.0 to 5.0, LDL & BP excellent, and my energy is fantastic. I eat 3-5 portions of fruit and beans, no glucose spikes.

I also do IF.
9182 2018-09-23 17:38:36 Il aurait été possible de réduire les taxes sur l’essence tout en augmentant moins celles sur le gaz oil !

9184 2018-09-23 17:38:29 As I sit, waiting for an oil change to be done, I consider the immortal words of George Carlin, “keep thy religion to thyself,” as someone turns the waiting room TV to a broadcast preacher.
9185 2018-09-23 17:38:25 Organic witch hazel, tea tree oil on the spots, and Indian Aztec healing clay. You can use African black soap, I’ve used 3 real organic ones infrequently but they were still too harsh. The only one that worked was the shea moisture one with black soap extract.

9188 2018-09-23 17:37:52 CBD oil or hemp oil contains the benefits of the cannabis plant without the potential drawbacks of psychoactive compounds typically found from inhalation or other methods of consumption. #TheMoreYouKnow #CBD #3BLforLiving
9189 2018-09-23 17:37:46 also “big money” is so generic, say “big developer” or “big oil” or “big lego” or something more entertaining, geez

9196 2018-09-23 17:36:08 Oil painting:  There are no child prodigies in art. Music, yes. Art, never.  Why? Music systems have strictly defined "notes". There is no note between A and A-flat. Art is not the same. A piano defines 12 notes. Artists "try" to define 12 colors\values. Years to overcome lies.
9197 2018-09-23 17:35:58 I need an oil change
9198 2018-09-23 17:35:51 Good news, Good News ! Plenty of oil and water! YEAH! 
Now lets just pray that the #DirtDogHairAndDesperation holds it together to get it through its MOT!  Enjoy the last few hours of the weekend 
9199 2018-09-23 17:35:49 Wow. Imagine a city fan saying that even 10 years ago. Short memories indeed. Oil money inspires confidence! A long way they have come since fighting to stay in this division and only seeing european football if a decent side played a preseason friendly against them. Ridiculous.

9227 2018-09-23 17:32:08 So I’m a HUGE fan of oils because I’m actually a lizard. So I use a hyaluronic acid & Marula oil. For some reason I remember us talking about you being dry as well? If you drink lots of water try a combo like what I use. OR try using Weleda Skin food...it’s thick but oil based.

9234 2018-09-23 17:30:42 EV cars as we know them today are a fad.. having to carry half a ton of explosive batteries about is ludicrous. In 10years time we'll be laughing at battery powered cars when the oil companies finally released the patents they've been hiding away to keep oil prices high.

9260 2018-09-23 17:26:58 Lol. Is this your way of acknowledging that the Alberta NDP has done a good job of managing our oil and gas sector? I agree wholeheartedly!

9261 2018-09-23 17:26:55 Truffle oil can be fattening if you use too much
9262 2018-09-23 17:26:51 True. Most Americans econ illiterate and not realizing they are financing China 2025 and Belt and Road initiative. Fight now, or later when China is much stronger economically
9263 2018-09-23 17:26:48 I’m sure there is an oil for this
9264 2018-09-23 17:26:46 They can smell and taste that oil. Bet they know the quality and quantity and predicted price for 2025. Lol
9265 2018-09-23 17:26:28 Well, some neighbors no longer speak to each other. Friendships are ruined. There are more shootings then before. There may be more drilling and oil spills off this coast, more fracking to ruin ground water fewer people to pick crops. Good job, #GOP

9269 2018-09-23 17:25:58 Try writing maintenance manuals for the oil & gas industry!  That'll really kill your chops. I think you'll be okay with the screenwriting. Think of it as an extended exercise in dialogue #writing. Good luck! #WritingCommunity
9270 2018-09-23 17:25:47 Wonder if his party / campaign received any money from oil / gas / coal lobby & companies?? Hmmm. Perhaps he can confirm or deny.

9272 2018-09-23 17:25:08 they could do much better.  That cheap cheese has to go.  How about cheddar? How about making the burger a little bigger than a sheet of paper?  Change the cooking oil once in a while. When it comes to fast food Americans love junk by the crowds

9282 2018-09-23 17:22:51 I recently read something about how to cook brown rice, and it totally changed the flavor. If you toast the rice in a little oil before you steam/boil it, the flavor and texture are way better
9283 2018-09-23 17:22:45 You know what? Never mind. She’s kind of right. They probably don’t have peanuts all over like The Ground Round or Texas Roadhouse, but they do cook their fries in peanut oil. 
9284 2018-09-23 17:22:44 Nothing better than oil down on a Sunday 
9285 2018-09-23 17:22:42 I don’t blame you! Quite right. We have to buy oil in bulk which is pretty expensive. & the reason I’m being so careful!

Green card means they can work in slavlandia @geraldcelente  famous name for the USA. but can be kicked out if they don't follow the corporate tax rules and suffer?
9297 2018-09-23 17:21:11 Norway is not «leading the way» in renewable energy. We just happen to have loads of hydropower. Norway is leading the way in offshore arctic drilling for oil and gas though. Sadly.
9298 2018-09-23 17:20:39 That is often not true however, perceptions of “poor infrastructure” are being pushed heavily by those with a vested interest against EVs, such as @ToyotaGB with its “choose not to plug in” and others like big oil

9312 2018-09-23 17:19:23 They would have struggled to do that without the supplies of material, trucks, oil that was supplied at great cost in lives through the Arctic convoys, and the fact that Germany was fighting on two fronts. But they deserve most of the credit, yes.

9317 2018-09-23 17:18:47 In addition when using gas cylinder/Stove to heat or steam up your oil, make sure you put it off before pouring your fresh pepper/tomato, it might explode especially when the oil is Xtremely hot. I escaped such last month.

9345 2018-09-23 17:14:50 The bigger issue is that these states dont need the amount of civil servants they currently have. It is always either meager resources are used to pay salaries or used to executive projects. Any Governor is in that conundrum, except oil prices hit the roof again

9400 2018-09-23 17:05:18 Every oil producer regulates the rate at which they take oil out of the ground. The more you spend, the more you can produce.  Outside of Saudi, I see no real ability for other OPEC countries to bring meaningful additional barrels to market.  OPEC is busted.

9439 2018-09-23 16:59:42 You have no clue what is going on in Europe. You are pouring oil on a smoldering fire. Not we but you will propel extreme right into power with your irresponsible behavior.
9440 2018-09-23 16:59:28 Time to tell Brussels to get stuffed. No payment to leave. To trading away our fishing rights. If they play hard ball hit proseco, Olive oil, red wine, German cars....with massive import tarrifs and watch Europe crash and burn.
9441 2018-09-23 16:59:21 A bit of a mixture, mostly Tamiya, bit of Vallejo, occasionally some Mig, although not on this. Plus oil paint washes and lacquers.
9442 2018-09-23 16:58:52 PDVSA (Venezuelan state-owned oil company) used to be a run efficiently. Then Chavez and co. replaced the competent mangers with party apparchiks and the company went to hell. Do you believe in data? I’d be happy to send you some 50 year output numbers + living standards.
9443 2018-09-23 16:58:40 but every day you used the oil that comes from  Nafta if Nafta was gone your gas would go up

9448 2018-09-23 16:57:53 If Trump would stop tweeting ,oil prices would go down,
Iran official says.
That's odd Americans in the know can't believe oil prices 
aren't higher because of Trump.
9449 2018-09-23 16:57:49 pecorino was v. piquant, had to be soften with the olive oil / orange tapenade.
9450 2018-09-23 16:57:40 I am in the UK but he has still had a negative effect on me as his pulling out of the Iran deal has raised oil prices and therefore fuel prices here also.

9458 2018-09-23 16:57:05 Venezuela is nothing like our country. As you say, it's oil rich and it's economy is based upon the value of the commodity - but sanctioned heavily by the US. Neither apply to the UK. Corbyn's mantra is closer to Scandinavian countries who are doing just fine.

9479 2018-09-23 16:55:03 The Oil Refinery for which the foundation stone was already laid by UPA Govt, has once again been inaugurated by PM Modi and CM Raje, and delayed by 5 years.

9487 2018-09-23 16:53:58 Yes, I am aware of their plans for Iran. It would be tragic to attack Iran. It would make Iraq look like a little skirmish. Iran could easily put the Strait of Hormuz, the chokepoint through which much of the world’s oil passes, out of commission.

9495 2018-09-23 16:53:03 The UK “Single Market” is nothing other than a means to control Scotland’s economy. We can’t sell our Whisky, Oil, Beef, Lamb or services to anyone that England doesn’t do a trade deal with post Brexit. Explain how remaining in UK serves our interests? #DissolveTheUnion

9499 2018-09-23 16:52:13 Yes almonds have more omega 3 oil than peanuts do. I could easily have an almond butter addiction if not for the fact that almonds tend to make my lupus symptoms flare (as most nuts and seeds do). However, since peanuts are technically legumes, they don’t bother me as much.

9518 2018-09-23 16:49:36 kind of like Obama's power needed to be restrained. The problem is that we need to get rid of democrats and republicans. Neither care about America. Only power. They are both snake oil salesman

We had $70billion in infrastructural deficit.

9536 2018-09-23 16:47:31 Putin has to have pipelines and shipping lanes to fulfill Supply Chain and move his oil.

Who might be buying it in transit, who is washing it, then stockpiling it--where?

Are companies like Exxon drilling or buying cheap Russian Oil then moving into refineries?
9537 2018-09-23 16:47:11 Either that or hash oil.
9538 2018-09-23 16:47:08 Companies. Including international companies. The only revenue the Treasury gets from oil is from tax on profits, of which there aren't much now. And Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies when the price sank.

9544 2018-09-23 16:45:48 If Scotland was independent, it would be Scotland who sells the licences to oil and gas companies for all drilling and exploration along with taxes from those companies who have operations in Scottish territorial waters.
9545 2018-09-23 16:45:45 well since congress lifted oil export ban in 2015 we are not prepared and we still buy from open market if we have all this gas n lp why r our costs rising for both  when it should be cheap for our citizens
9546 2018-09-23 16:45:42 I think that was the culmination of shaky performances the year before forcing Oil hand to play Cam in 73 gms, below average in Bakers that year, and weak in 5 NHL gms the year before that.  Not based on the 1st or 1st & 2nd preseason games.

9558 2018-09-23 16:44:16 All oil and gas wells are fracked, the fact some are hydraulically fractured doesn’t make them unique. “Fracked” is somewhat of a malapropism these days, as misinterpreted as the actual process is misunderstood.
9559 2018-09-23 16:44:15 It's not that red anymore. I have driven through a lot of the cities and towns there, and saw lots of Beto signs. If you're a free market Repub, you should support wind as we phased out our subsidies. Oil, coal and nuclear still take govt subsidies, and can't compete w/ wind.

9564 2018-09-23 16:43:33 The best part of all this is that even if they had somehow decided to not sell any more oil, someone else would have.

9572 2018-09-23 16:42:31 Hopefully a wake up call for those independence supporting Labour voters who were taken in by the metropolitan socialist snake oil politician. Rules of self determination obviously only apply to other countries.
9573 2018-09-23 16:42:25 HIGHER OIL PRICES MAY HURT DEMAND
MKT SHORTFALLS WILL BE MET FROM OPEC And SPARE CAPACITY
WE DO NOT SEEK TO INCREASE CRUDE PRICES 
IT’S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT WE WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION NEXT YEAR

imo, that is to say price will decrease despite the sanctions against Iran

9577 2018-09-23 16:41:40 The Oil Refinery for which the foundation stone was already laid by UPA Govt, has once again been inaugurated by PM Modi and CM Raje, and delayed by 5 years. This has delayed the income or made a loss of at least rupees 5000 crores to the State Exchequer. #RajeRuinedRajasthan

9590 2018-09-23 16:40:07 One of the easiest fixes if something totally goes dead is to check all the connections. But then again this is DSP, the person that didn't get an oil change in his car because he didn't get an email telling him to.... lol
9591 2018-09-23 16:39:56 I’m assuming if we can keep Rick Scott from the Senate, he will just become a lobbyist for one of the concerns he’s used to rip off Florida: big sugar, big oil, big pharma, charter schools, or his all time favorite, healthcare fraud.
9592 2018-09-23 16:39:56 Give it 10 years and another mid table club will be bought by an Arabian billionaire, and they’ll become a top 6 club. Your nothing special. Without your oil money you’d be competing with Everton for Europa League
9593 2018-09-23 16:39:44 I need water,coconut oil,aloe vera and chapstick like friends in my life!
9594 2018-09-23 16:38:57 Speaking of which, any health store sell MCT oil in Jamaica? When copping on Amazon I need to go ministry of health to get it approved.
9595 2018-09-23 16:38:48 I always eat cauliflower crust pizza and coconut oil when I go to Italy. Doesn't everyone?
9596 2018-09-23 16:38:47 Coconut oil is equally bad for acne prone or oily skin though. It has a comedogenic of 4/5 which means it's highly likely to clog pores.
9597 2018-09-23 16:38:12 Hi, Taz. our Flat Iron Square site is open all day on Saturdays. With certain weather forecasts, it can be quite challenging attempting to keep the stall dry & safe from the rain especially when using fryers with hot oil. I was unaware at the time however they did reopen.

How do we initiate and imbibe the importation of employment and other things? Instead of buying always can't we exchange what we have with what we don't have? Cocoa for Technology, or oil for infrastructures.

9623 2018-09-23 16:34:04 It’s alright, I’ve got this covered. Send an oil drilling vessel to park over Beaufort’s Dyke, wait until there’s a moderate SE breeze & start drilling. Liverpool will no longer be an issue.

9660 2018-09-23 16:28:43 Yes let’s get real on this. The tax revenue collected in Scotland is double our block grant. So an equal amount of that stays with England to keep you out of shit. But that’s not all. You also take £50 billion on our oil. So yes England will loose £80 billion p/a. Scotland free.

9662 2018-09-23 16:28:28 I just wasted SO much paint. I completly misjudged how much I needed! I'm running out quickly, I've already ran out of black, and I've had to resort to mixing water colour, acrylic, and oil paint, to have enough.
What? I should just buy more?
I can't afford it!
This makes me sad.
9663 2018-09-23 16:28:28 I think stretch marks are peng ! But if it really bothers you bio-oil every day after showering when the skins soft or recycle your coffee grounds and add olive oil and that combination is an amazing body scrub that helps the skin hydrate and stretch back a little x
9664 2018-09-23 16:28:18 Don’t worry there’s an oil for that

9672 2018-09-23 16:26:45 This "Progress"ion is flowing from all things. The 10-values of form in oil painting, help in place for hundreds of years, are today degraded down to 7 or 5.  Why? because viewers are duller and less educated on values. "It's good enough" has become the basis of art, and society.

Agro Products yes but then u need favourable markets not sanctions.
9705 2018-09-23 16:22:03 Good Friends and Good Times chopping boards, ideal for bread and cheese.  The boards are £30 (inc delivery) measure 11"x18" and are finished with oil to protect and treat the wax.
9706 2018-09-23 16:21:58 Ms. Ford.... “For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.”  (Proverbs 5:3,4)

9708 2018-09-23 16:21:18 And a homeless shelter and a boarding school and a cruise ship and a hospital and a prison and a oil rig and a caravan... As I said, we’re having two different conversations. I’m happy to talk about coliving, etc. But right now I’m talking about the awards system.

9714 2018-09-23 16:20:16 MSG is fine - I think most of the fear of it is originally derived from racist attitudes to Chinese restaurants. Palm oil is worth trying to avoid but it is used in a very small quantity here - it's listed after Flavor Enhancers in the ingredients.
9715 2018-09-23 16:20:01 Oh I’m sure you can do it. It’s really easy. As long as you have a source for the Shea butter and the oil, you’re set.
9716 2018-09-23 16:19:47 Also, we have been able to trade perfectly well with the rest of the world whilst in the EU, struggling to see any benefit from leaving. Just massive job losses and higher prices for food and oil. Feel free to correct me if I’ve missed anything.
9717 2018-09-23 16:19:46 My lil sister makes the best coconut oil. Has me smelling like biscuits

9722 2018-09-23 16:19:06 El artículo es bastante apestoso. Echa la culpa soterradamente a los países emergentes, Venezuela a la cabeza, pero del «peak oil« y del consumo desaforado y suicida de las economías capitalistas ni palabra.
9723 2018-09-23 16:19:00 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
9724 2018-09-23 16:18:40 Transportation costs are a variable that pulls the price of oil down. The farther you need to transport, the more that cost is going to eat into your bottom line.
9725 2018-09-23 16:18:20 You don't actually need red oil. 

(If you are on a healthy diet, you can substitute blended red pepper for red oil)
9726 2018-09-23 16:18:00 Putin wants oil shipping monopoly
9727 2018-09-23 16:17:59 Try sautéing dry short grain brown rice in teaspoon of coconut oil for 1-2 mins, then add water to cook.  This may change your mind.
9728 2018-09-23 16:17:57 James, mate. Everyone had the internet at their disposal to find out ANYTHING they want. More than anyone could have ever imagined in 1975 when we voted in. By the way, you do realise that in 1975, the public seen EC membership as a side-issue. They was more concerned about oil.

9744 2018-09-23 16:15:32 Put a little Argon oil on the sore places. It feels so good.
9745 2018-09-23 16:15:30 The Norwegians did not survive and prosper in a fairly unforgiving climate for centuries, before they discovered oil, by being clever, stubborn and inventive.
9746 2018-09-23 16:15:30 tearfully explaining my name is pronounced Oil, and not Earl.
9747 2018-09-23 16:15:22 Yes, over 10 years ago, pre-kids and commitments, and in a moment of baffling largesse, I bought a Vitamix (essentially a commercial blender sold directly to the public). It makes amazing seed and nut butters. Some of the commercial ones have palm oil and who knows what else in.
9748 2018-09-23 16:15:22 According to the 70s oil crisis we shall have no oil by now. How do we have such an abundance of oil now? Why are all our Capped off oil drilling location full again?  Rockefeller introduce the false Fossil fuel notion to the government. What did he own? Simple logic.
9749 2018-09-23 16:15:07 And for God's sake, make sure to have a towel close by to wipe the oil and sweat off your face!!!

9758 2018-09-23 16:14:23 It’s not imaginary, I’ve thought it way before Trump. They broke up Standard Oil , The phone companies, why shouldn’t these monopolies that shape the minds of people be looked at ?
9759 2018-09-23 16:14:17 Red oil too...
9760 2018-09-23 16:14:07 Because we supported Israel. We do to this day, we were not prepared in 1973 like we are today. With the advance in science and technology we have more oil and natural gas to last us for generations.  We dont need them, they need us.
9761 2018-09-23 16:14:04 Should one avoid mustard oil and olive oil too?

9764 2018-09-23 16:13:45 No, they see their families and friends blown to bits by our army so that we can control oil in the region and want revenge. If there's several million people, there's going to be a few who want to arm themselves and take revenge upon themselves. It's not difficult to grasp
9765 2018-09-23 16:13:45 @NancyLeeGrahn Nancy, take the bath with the lavender oil and have a gin martini or bloody  and cheers from the East Coast!  . . . As for @MichaelAvenatti . . .

9769 2018-09-23 16:13:25 Being honest the import business in Spain is shocking as it is. Unless you buy olive oil, wine, marble, fruit and veg, everything else is a bloody fortune due to import costs.  It maybe Spain doesn't import from the UK. Exporting wine, oil etc may get more expensive in the UK.
9770 2018-09-23 16:13:12 Sabi ko sa sarili ko, mag start na ako mag oil paint this year pero heto pa rin ako, tambay sa Twitter

9777 2018-09-23 16:12:36 did I miss the part of my history class where standard oil was nationalized to solve a problem half the country thought was fake news?

capital is not invincible but fighting it through means with any shot of working is a synonym of "fighting capitalism"

9779 2018-09-23 16:12:25 “For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. She gives no thought to the way of life;” Proverbs 5:3-6
9780 2018-09-23 16:12:25 1. Olive oil and caster oil mixed together & applied to lashes promotes growth

2. Petroleum jelly applied on your lashes at night & left over night, can make them grow faster. Apply 3-4 times a week.
9781 2018-09-23 16:12:19 Right.. Maryam is the Patsy= Manchurian candidate who is willing to steal oil from the country and help America sell the rest of the citizens out. When America offers help, be aware because they are like Kings who spoil the land, make leaders slaves, and kill or jail activist!!!
9782 2018-09-23 16:12:00 I equate it to running an engine out of oil, eventually it locks up and you have to get another engine.  That's what will happen in November.

9792 2018-09-23 16:11:08 Like if I use pure witch hazel it dries my skin out a bit so I usually add a little sunflower or lavender oil to it. But if you already have a moisturizer you should be good.

9796 2018-09-23 16:10:39 Oil Refinery for which foundation stone was already laid by UPA Govt, has once again inaugurated by PM Modi n CM Raje, and delayed by 5 years.

9805 2018-09-23 16:09:23 So was Standard Oil? I don't know why socialist would pretend capital is invincible.
9806 2018-09-23 16:09:19 I mean Russia and China are trying real hard I'll say that.  Then again, that money we know won't be managed very well to put it lightly

9808 2018-09-23 16:09:14 No such thing as FOSSIL fuel. Oil is a RENEWABLE RESOURCE and does not come from large dead lizards. Point of FACT, all the old dried up oil wells from the 30's are all full again. This argument is a liberal FALLACY, like MAN MADE global warming.

9827 2018-09-23 16:07:59 I had one of the first Potenza groupsets imported a few year’s ago. Rather than cosset it and see how it performed, it was put straight onto a steel winter bike and ridden through a typical British winter. I didn’t clean or maintain it, just light oil. Still works perfectly

Have not had any issue with them at all. 
They also run at 30 degrees for the oil and 50 for the miners, I think thats what makes them run faster :)
9839 2018-09-23 16:05:58 African black soaps work, but they are all different, some have coconut oil in it an I use that. You can use baking soda mixed with coconut oil in a jar an wash your face with it, an it’s also healing clay mask you can use, you can just mix that with water and vinegar

9841 2018-09-23 16:05:48 @AskTSA I have body oil fragrances that I want to bring with me because the spray kind irritates my skin, could I bring these with me? I think they'd be preferable in the luggage than a carry-on since they don't fit the 3-1-1.
9842 2018-09-23 16:05:44 Nobody said they’re against oil. It’s used in most products. It’s the prolific wasting & pollution from it with single use plastics & tailpipes Emissions sitting at the drive thru for a $2 coffee that MUST STOP

9981 2018-09-23 15:48:13 Trump has been harder on Russia in a year & a half than Obama was in 8 years. He has expelled 60 diplomats, close consulates in Seattle, NY, DC, San Fran. Plus multiple rounds of sanctions. Russia is an oil based economy. Trump pushing oil here drives down the price hurting Putin

Then you’ll have experienced happiness.

9988 2018-09-23 15:47:28 America is now the world’s leader in the production of oil.
9989 2018-09-23 15:47:28 Do you not think they are more than balanced out by the even bigger presence of 'deeply discredited absolute snake oil salesmen' on the hard Brexit side of the argument? Banks, Farage, Gove, Johnson, Fox, IDS, Rees-Mogg, Leadsom, Davis, Redwood, Hannan, Cash, Jenkin, Murdoch etc.
9990 2018-09-23 15:47:26 Alexandre Boulerice is just another NDP Hypocrite. He doesn't mind flying all over Canada in a fossil fuel jet but hate Alberta Oil & Gas. Boulerice & Singh just love to trash Alberta and thanks for punching Rachel Notley in the face.

9997 2018-09-23 15:46:58 The #Pakistani nation has given #ImranKhan votes to bring a change
But very sadly
The prices of #gas & and oil #oilandgas prises are rising in the same way,
 The foreign policy is extremely disappointed
Everything is going on like that past,
Who will bring change in #Pakistan?

10004 2018-09-23 15:45:57 If USDINR is key, then we can't expect much from RBI, they have limited resources & oil will be the determining factor. I still think continued good earnings & GDP numbers will keep markets from major crashes. If they falter, then Friday was just a trailer of what is to come.
10005 2018-09-23 15:45:52 The western capitalists robbed these dumb Arabs of the precious resource, the oil and in return gave tham Mineral Water, Pepsi and Baskin Robins Ice Cream!
10006 2018-09-23 15:45:51 Yes their sovereign wealth fund from their oil has near enough funded them since its discovery.

10014 2018-09-23 15:45:08 Your a VGSA. Volunteer GAS Station Attendant. Big oil accountants crunched the numbers then sat with marketing & devised a plan to convince you, you’re saving money filling their product in your tank! Now they can each afford 2 more vacation properties. Your our HERO!
10015 2018-09-23 15:45:06 Oil and vinegar don’t mix but it’s a match made in heaven like Bobby and Whitney.

10023 2018-09-23 15:43:59 Jerry Dias has no clue about how the oil industry works. None. 
But that won’t stop him from talking. #CTVQP
10024 2018-09-23 15:43:57 It's like Friday Night Lights, but instead of playing FB to escape the oil fields, it's to avoid becoming a neurosurgeon or tech millionaire
10025 2018-09-23 15:43:52 Obama was in church far more than the snake oil salesman we have now.
10026 2018-09-23 15:43:34 Because defence contractors wants to supply Pentagon with weapons and oil companies eyeing irans oil resources which they cant get now easily when there is a stable government.

The British people will never tolerate that, we're far to used to kissing the arses of our 'betters' whilst moaning about immigrants, welfare 'cheats', single mums etc, heaven forbid we should go after the tax dodging spivs, the fake snake oil salesmen
10037 2018-09-23 15:42:34 Oil seeds as we import large part of edible oils for our consumption especially palm oil.
