40 2018-11-15 23:52:49 There’s always a bogeyman in the market to explain why people are losing money. program trading>day traders>hedge funds>stat-arb>HFT> and now ETFs.  The simple answer is stocks go down sometimes, but that makes terrible copy.
41 2018-11-15 23:51:50 I've already got lots of cannabis stocks. Will augmented reality look cooler if I'm stoned?
42 2018-11-15 23:50:20 That's good.  I thought you were long all those dog charts! Not the right market for those themes regardless of fundamentals (Uranium fundamentals been bullish for years, stocks been shit as you know). It's gonna get ugly.  Hedge your bets.
43 2018-11-15 23:48:56 I just shared a tweet with u with a bill preventing major companies buying back there stocks instead of increasing wages and creating more technological opportunities. I do not care who d president is all I care is for me to have same share of the spoil.
44 2018-11-15 23:47:27 Why so much stupid still buying $amd, chip. Stocks in late cycle. Very slow sales. Look at $nvda, buy back means no where to invest.
45 2018-11-15 23:47:06 Historic national debt, stocks declining.  In what world is that the right direction?
46 2018-11-15 23:46:42 Bump stocks are unnecessarily inaccurate and I dont own any 50 cals but of course I own an AR. Good luck with that nerf bat at the house. The squeaking sounds per blow may scare off the more timid
47 2018-11-15 23:44:50 Keep telling yourself that. They put the poor in stocks and share the riches amongst themselves.
48 2018-11-15 23:44:48 Even I, a poor lad can afford to get a nice custom fit $1000 suit for job interviews and special occasions. People can afford luxuries even when on a lower income.

Regardless, it's been shown that Cortez has 15k in savings account and 50k in stocks.
49 2018-11-15 23:43:51 Hey hey hey. My stocks have been plasti for 4 years lol
50 2018-11-15 23:43:09 to WALL street  THANKS all 7 stocks underwater
51 2018-11-15 23:43:06 Not sure why @Facebook is not the oil stocks of our day. Sell it. It's poison.
52 2018-11-15 23:42:27 Rates matter, QT not so much. Stocks are flat since this initial exchange after two more hikes and a likely third.
53 2018-11-15 23:40:00 Bought from stocks ..since the inception...refiners dont take it out..
54 2018-11-15 23:39:49 Notice what tech stocks are green Friday after the Nvidia reaction.
55 2018-11-15 23:39:09 Don't buy down trending stocks! 
56 2018-11-15 23:39:07 hte fame is getting to me... I'm relying on my Weetabix stocks to buy me Pariston lovers
57 2018-11-15 23:38:43 Hey babe, wasn't $NVDA one of you "deep value" plays as well?  $KBH, $WSM, $NVDA  if you have followers who bought those stocks recently on your promotion of them, you better own them too.
58 2018-11-15 23:38:31 Are those stocks the government’s that they can regulate access to them? What next? Can’t buy hamburgers unless the restaurant has unisex bathrooms? #oppression #liberallogic
59 2018-11-15 23:38:25 Ok, this is getting very interesting now. Citi strategists update:  Overall the US and IT stocks should outperform heading into next year.  Credit spreads should widen #ausbiz #XJO #equities #investing #equities
60 2018-11-15 23:38:06 The US dollar also fell, losing ground against most major currencies. However a rally in US shares that snapped a five session losing streak sees Asia Pacific stocks set for opening gains @MicMcCarthy_CMC
61 2018-11-15 23:34:47 Yes little mini bump stocks
62 2018-11-15 23:34:09 It's not quantity that matters so much as impact, for example HFT is used with impunity to kill off stocks prior to take over offers. HFT is used for the benefit of a small group, not the market as a whole and it's prevalence on the ASX has led it to be an underperforming market.
63 2018-11-15 23:32:15 In stocks in parliament square maybe
64 2018-11-15 23:30:28 Ah thanks Ali, I’m gutted honestly! I also wanted some more of those extra soft bamboo socks for Charlie if @daisyandtilly still stocks them. 
65 2018-11-15 23:29:02 Mostly working in $EIX over the last two days - preferred stocks - but I played out different scenarios in my head and don't see many viable outcomes except appropriate legislation changes or forest management improvement. Can't put the blame solely on companies like that.
66 2018-11-15 23:27:14 If Nancy leads Dems to First pass Comprehensive GUN CONTRO, including Universal Background Checks, Closing Gun Show & Online purchasing loopholes; banning 'Bump Stocks' & addressing Mental Health issues…She will be a superstar. Remember: 61% of Americans Want Stricter Gun Laws!
67 2018-11-15 23:26:45 CEOs want stocks to get cheaper to execute buybacks.... lol
68 2018-11-15 23:25:32 Investors don’t seem interested in owning commodity stocks anymore.  Everyone buys into notion they’re going away which is silly IMO...
69 2018-11-15 23:24:28 This has been day with other stocks
70 2018-11-15 23:24:07 am retired --took 100% of my money and bought pot stocks--that is a good strategy, right?  took the other 100% and bought bitcoin---i took  the rest of my modest money and bought nvda today---i am sharp as a marble
71 2018-11-15 23:23:49 Canada stocks higher at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite up 0.09%
72 2018-11-15 23:23:33 U.S. stocks higher at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.83%
73 2018-11-15 23:21:55 Yet I'm sure it won't ever go as low as Movie Pass's HMNY! Lol
74 2018-11-15 23:21:08 yes we trade most markets. Crypto, FX, gold/silver, some tech stocks.
75 2018-11-15 23:18:53 Sale of stocks can only be taxable income to stockbrokers though...
For a journalism company, it's investment.
Big difference.
Got the point?
76 2018-11-15 23:18:23 Let me guess...@God__Himself you are a proponent of AR 15s and bump stocks oh and You need a 50 cal to protect your lawn 
77 2018-11-15 23:18:16 Sell the stocks
78 2018-11-15 23:17:50 prob a good move considering BAD, EIF, HCG haven’t exactly been money making shorts esp w/ borrowing costs and what the stocks have done. I would considering going quiet too esp if the loud garbage rhetoric didn’t help the cause. Says not self serving though! Righteous human lol
79 2018-11-15 23:17:44 @WSJ Donald Trump hurrying up trying to sell off some of his stocks and investments and not the circuits are trying to cover themselves up all of her running rapid talking to the lawyers and now telling the other lawyers that were in
80 2018-11-15 23:17:37 How was it ridiculous? 
Was it the bayonet mounts or the foreign wood stocks?  
Maybe the thing that goes up?
81 2018-11-15 23:17:09 @rueducommerce Génial 2 commandes annulé car pas de stocks avant même la sortie du produit et alors qu'une précommande était faite depuis plus de 2 mois. Le remboursement sous 2 semaines d'après, mais j’espère pour vous que les frais de livraison son bien remboursé aussi ?
82 2018-11-15 23:16:20 Shit posting about stocks is my jam lately.
83 2018-11-15 23:15:39 Yes, since Melee. That 95% of the players just prefers 2,3, or 4 stocks per match, doesn't mean you can't go further.
84 2018-11-15 23:15:23 Stocks and investing is what I'm interested in
85 2018-11-15 23:14:02 Rational people are looking for reasoned laws. Background checks, no exceptions, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks, no semi-automatic weapons, gun locks, mandatory securing of weapons. That leaves 99% of people with the right to bear arms.
86 2018-11-15 23:13:53 So you gone find great sex from an educated man who has a awsome career, a laid 15yr future plan, stocks and assets up to par, under 30 and has a great street rep anywhere????
87 2018-11-15 23:13:40 apple stocks rise by 20%.
88 2018-11-15 23:13:01 CBA: downgrade Brent oil prices by 14% to US$73/bbl in CY19 and by 2% to US$67/bbl in CY20. Stronger US production should keep WTI oil at a steep discount to Brent until later next year when infrastructure constraints ease #ausbiz #XJO #investing #crudeoil #energy #stocks
89 2018-11-15 23:12:14 $NVDA -16%  Another very good example of why more than ever I've suggested to not hold stocks through earnings this quarter.
90 2018-11-15 23:12:05 You’re a complete and utter shyster @RoryStewartUK you lied! Thank you @EmmaBarnett for picking that up and not letting him get away with more lies. Can’t we bring back public stocks for dealing with snake oil salesmen like this?
91 2018-11-15 23:12:04 Jim, dont fret this guy. You are not a psycic or a god so people should not just do what you say on a whim without homework.. Clearly this guy never read any of your books.. I am new to the stocks since august. I am up 3.5% so far on my actuals.. Thanks to your teachings
92 2018-11-15 23:11:41 Stocks like nvda have a constituency thats "shoot first ask questions later"
93 2018-11-15 23:11:26 You promote stocks as well dumb ass.. I have old messages of you acting to be people who bashed in BVTK to pump it
94 2018-11-15 23:10:40 $NVDA shows what can happen when a hyper growth stock disappoints and their P/E was at least double digits.  Don’t want to be anywhere around stocks like $CRM if they disappoint.
95 2018-11-15 23:09:53 Wall Street staged a recovery last night, snapping a four-day losing streak, on renewed optimism on trade relations spurred investment in stocks. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.83%. The S&P 500 rose 1.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.72%.
96 2018-11-15 23:05:39 Might be a reason stocks are falling.
97 2018-11-15 23:05:18 Not to major in the minor but this takes substantially more time to do than tracking prices. But I do employ this method for my more long term/dividend stocks.
98 2018-11-15 23:04:43 Stocks and bonds, investments, llcs and business type shit.
99 2018-11-15 23:02:08 ASIC investigation concludes: High-frequency traders are responsible for a quarter of all market transactions in equities and the AUD/USD cross rate, and it is trending down #ausbiz #XJO #equities #stocks #investing

102 2018-11-15 23:00:59 Needed some cash. Went to sell some stocks at a loss. Saw a bunch of cash available for withdrawal. Wtf? Realize I typoed when I bought -- only bought 24 instead of 240.  Saved by my own stupidity.
103 2018-11-15 23:00:51 That is not true. I certainly have never heard a criticism of lower tax rates on bonds.  Even middle class folks can benefit from bonds mostly because they are less risky than stocks.  Although, there is more risk these days with so many cities having disasters.
104 2018-11-15 23:00:30 Market Close: MBS +11bps; DOW +208.77; NASDAQ +122.64; S&P 500 +28.62; 10yr Treasury 3.11%; Stocks end day in Positive Territory after being in the Red for a good portion of it.  MBS followed suit.
105 2018-11-15 22:57:36 @WSJ 2018 is becoming "unnecessary" for stocks except for a few like @Tesla and @amazon Market indexes are flat from where they ended in 2017. YTD S&P500 up 2.1%, Dow up 2.3%, Nasdaq up 5.1%.  𝗧𝗲𝘀𝗹𝗮 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗽 11.9%.

107 2018-11-15 22:54:13 So why are the pipeline stocks not in greater demand?
108 2018-11-15 22:54:04 I dreamt that all the stocks in my portfolio went up, and then today they all went down 
109 2018-11-15 22:53:52 @HulkCapitalPro Not exactly low float stocks, but maybe Chinese internet stocks are the ones that move in the shortened holiday Thanksgiving week. Many report next week.
110 2018-11-15 22:53:27 You and your "paid for", useless wife are laughing stocks of the WORLD!! 
Also, you BOTH NEED NEW HAIDO'S....(Her's is from the 80's)
111 2018-11-15 22:53:08 Here is another ugly fact and none of the main reasons we are in desperate need of a major re-balancing. 6 out of the 10 top holdings of the $SPY the S&P index are tech stocks. MAGA and $FB 2 of those top 10 are $GOOG AND $GOOGL 
112 2018-11-15 22:53:06 it hasn't been the GOP in power for decades, the middle class has been decimated, wages flat, stocks for her class booming, don't accept standards as though we should be grateful beggars, congressional polls showed awful performance across the board, no more 1%
113 2018-11-15 22:52:54 The answer is yes!  W don’t need AR-15’s and bump stocks for hunting.  Politicians receive so much in the way of donations, that they won’t vote against the NRA or institute #GunReform or #BanAssaultWeapons or #BanBumpStocks. My husband was born in CAN and after 55 yrs. in US, it
114 2018-11-15 22:52:52 Stocks and options really are the wave if you wanna make real money
115 2018-11-15 22:52:38 I think the fact that Smash 4 doubles ran on 3 stocks when singles was 2 stocks is already proof that 1v1s are not inherently faster, the more players, the harder it is to evade them, the faster damage gets piled up (+team kill confirms)
116 2018-11-15 22:51:59 Team of US economists offers alternative, anti-consensus outlook: we've raised potential growth to 2¼% in 2020 and believe the Fed, after a pause, resumes hiking in 2021 #ausbiz #XJO #equities #investing #stocks
117 2018-11-15 22:50:55 You investing in stocks?
118 2018-11-15 22:50:09 I ask this...

With things slowing... All earnings on these companies will fail in 2019 when they are compared to 2018 levels, and earnings are failing already

That sets up a BEAR market, so why would you buy into stocks when knowing that?
119 2018-11-15 22:49:35 Each of the major indexes closed nicely. The Dow was up 209; Nasdaq 123 and the S&P 29. During the recent unpleasantness, the Dow Transports have acted rather well - probably reflecting low energy prices but also suggesting that it isn’t the economy bothering stocks.
120 2018-11-15 22:46:33 No trades today didn’t like what I saw #stocks #stockmarket
121 2018-11-15 22:45:55 Why are the stocks down??
122 2018-11-15 22:45:35 Tesla stocks
123 2018-11-15 22:45:25 Impose a 5% sales tax on stocks. Boom!
124 2018-11-15 22:43:25 yum, companies whose products are slowly asphyxiating the planet with stocks that puke up every ephemeral rally. sign me up! 
125 2018-11-15 22:42:23 Coming up: retail stocks feeling the pressure with Black Friday one week away...what should we expect from the giants? We'll break it down next!
126 2018-11-15 22:42:08 Housing stocks falling, retail stocks falling, energy prices falling, semiconductor stocks falling, looks like the beginning of every recession the market has discounted in my 35 years of watching it discount fed induced business cycles, no economy not hitting on all cylinders.
127 2018-11-15 22:40:46 Well best step up to the plate then, Jezza. It’s NOT all gravy.... and that’s before BISTO stocks start to wain. #BrexitCrisis
128 2018-11-15 22:40:38 11 stocks! Was super impressive! Keep up the good work!
129 2018-11-15 22:40:11 @volalitegap @meowmerz I buy inversion stocks, I don't actually short the indexes themselves.

132 2018-11-15 22:39:14 Et puis au bout d'un moment, les stocks de pétrole vont diminuer, principe de l'offre et la demande, les prix augmenteront forcément.
133 2018-11-15 22:38:00 It's a trick question. You don't have to take $10,000 in cash. You can do $10,000 dollars of Gold, or Stocks or bitcoin! LOL
134 2018-11-15 22:36:16 That's 'cause London and UK stocks dived as Brexshit Withdrawal Agreement hit the fan and HM Government had six ministerial resignations today alone and the Prime Minister took a 3 1/5 hour beating-up in Parliament. It ain't over yet! Our pain, your gain.
135 2018-11-15 22:36:04 I'm wondering where all those guys that kept telling me: stocks don't go from making ATH to bear mkt immediately. 

There's a reason why they're called sell-side, D'oh!!

137 2018-11-15 22:35:04 The cobalt sector is one big mess; one that apparently no one understands. Spec money has come & gone. I think there is a-lot of potential left that the market will soon chase. Once that starts, I think stocks will already be 3-4x what they are now. Thoughts? #TheCobaltStory
138 2018-11-15 22:34:39 Europe will work it out because they actually know better (see 3 stocks for sm4sh and one country banning bayo pre last sm4sh patch) but unfortunately smash is us focused which is to smash U's detriment here
139 2018-11-15 22:34:28 @redbull I have really taken a liking to you coconut berry redbull. And the problem I’m haveing is I’m in the military and the base only stocks 5 cans of the coconut berry a week and I’d like to be able to get more anything you can do will be greatly appreciated.
140 2018-11-15 22:34:04 $SPY I could no doubt post 100+ setups tonight but I'll not do that. Instead will continue to focus on what I believe to be select stocks.

146 2018-11-15 22:32:53 Well betting short on the market, the 1% simply makes it happen by simply selling all their stocks into bonds, hold on the cash they will need to buy up your house, [now reduced in value,] buy up public infrastructure, cause states will be needing cash, then get a tax break too.

150 2018-11-15 22:31:17 Why would it dissuade Walmart form selling stock? Because they can’t buy their stocks back?
151 2018-11-15 22:31:11 Why nationalize a corporation above 120 PE? Amazon is at 128 today. Gonna cost the taxpayer way too much money even if the FED was used to print&buy stocks from the biggest corporations.
152 2018-11-15 22:30:18 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks and having the atf say they are a machine guns is ignorant. Want to loose 2020? Puss off the gun votor...

154 2018-11-15 22:29:24 Beavers are sometimes regarded as a nuisance because of their damming activities, and otters are occasionally blamed for the loss of fish stocks, although neither group has been extensively persecuted as a pest. However, reintroduction programs can encounter opposition from peeps

159 2018-11-15 22:26:41 was he not the man John Major referred to as 'swivel eyed'... he used to recommend stocks to investors so perhaps....

161 2018-11-15 22:25:08 The worst thing for Brits about this Brexit clusterfuckery is our current inability to feel superior to Americans. You tried your best to make yourselves the biggest international laughing stocks but we’ve well and truly Trumped you!!!

169 2018-11-15 22:19:32 With things slowing... All earnings on these companies will fail in 2019 when they are compared to 2018 levels, and earnings are failing already

That sets up a BEAR market, so why would you buy into stocks when knowing that?
170 2018-11-15 22:19:22 In Niger state we only have light 4 8hrs bcos we don't pay light bill here  claiming to b a power state, so few of us here just use this 8 hrs to preserve our stocks in our freezers
171 2018-11-15 22:18:49 How does a "stimulus package" on border with Gaza help immediate threat? Hamas received a Qatari "stimulus" recently. Helps increase their weapons stocks. Makes sense for @netanyahu to offer IF in addition to protection of #Israel citizens on border. No $ to them provides that.
172 2018-11-15 22:18:39 I don’t have anything against him either. It’s just that all he ever does is recommend stocks on good news after a big run. And he’s almost always a seller on bad news AFTER the stock has cratered.
173 2018-11-15 22:18:29 In my opinion stocks are highly inflated because the fed is just buying them up and thus causing high inflation. So is it the president that would have caused that?
174 2018-11-15 22:17:19 $nvda damn, that’s gotta hurtbtech stocks Friday.  Those $QQQ calls optionshawk noticed  may have been spot on.
175 2018-11-15 22:17:10 When #investing don't forget about hedging your position, e.g. when #buying #stocks  one can also "buy put option". This maneuver can secure your positions.  For more ditails I would recommend John Hull book "Options, Futures  and Other Derivatives" or ask good financial advisor
176 2018-11-15 22:17:07 I usually just buy a little at a time. No reason to be a hero. nibbling during corrections on the best stocks does work well long term.

3) Qatar National Bank - Syria: SYP 411.10
181 2018-11-15 22:15:34 I think it's a "sector" issue. Crypto is VERY small when compared to other asset classes and markets such as stocks and gold. Very, very small. So, when on one asset is affected, it affects many others. The space isn't big enough to prevent this (yet).
182 2018-11-15 22:15:20 When you own tech stocks you must accept the volatility that comes with it.  It’s hard. But you just keep you position size where you’re comfortable. But you have to buy when they give you the gift. $nvda
183 2018-11-15 22:15:02 I think I may have started with Stocks for Dummies and just read on. I was a history major so I didn’t have any formal finance training.

188 2018-11-15 22:12:28 I’ll put money, stocks, real estate and Glenn Beck gold coins on this entire conversation being absurd and sexist.
189 2018-11-15 22:11:16 yes sometime stocks doesn't do the exact number like 169 but may poke to 163 . or over shoot.. so we know where and why.. $NVDA
190 2018-11-15 22:10:02 In early Nov 2016, CNBC reported “a sharp immediate sell-off if Trump wins and a slight rally if Clinton wins”.

Also, CNN reported “If Donald Trump wins the election, U.S. stocks (and likely many other markets overseas) will almost certainly tank.”
191 2018-11-15 22:09:54 Can you chart uranium stocks lol
192 2018-11-15 22:09:06 depends on stocks prob. theyve been looking like they might be running out
193 2018-11-15 22:09:00 I clearly remember how much dines moved the uranium stocks he endorsed. The second he had a news release or you received the monthly subscription the stocks would move straight up like a hockey stick within seconds / minutes. It amazed me how much control he had.

205 2018-11-15 21:59:41 US markets opened lower, with hopes of trade negotiation between the US & China offset by mixed results from retailers & a slide in growth stocks.

208 2018-11-15 21:57:54 I would not jump over Xfund losing in a quarter. They got the Playa deal used some of the money to cut their debt in half. Cash flow high and Playa stocks will revalue and their Fl hotel is doing well. Good management etc
209 2018-11-15 21:56:28 our mkt trend is not positive , whatever we are getting , still its a bounceback... but the closing that each n every imp stock has given , is superb ... so max of those stocks shud move up now..  if nifty stays abv 10650 ....  then 10700-710 u ll see...  but thats a crucial lvl.

212 2018-11-15 21:55:36 And btw I have traded stocks for 35 years, I am in my late 50's not some 20 something. So I may not know as much as the 20 somethings about bitcoin but I know my way around capital markets.
213 2018-11-15 21:54:11 maybe I haven't read that, but I imagine if she has stocks as savings like I do she can't touch them anyway
214 2018-11-15 21:53:22 I heard she has $50,000 in stocks as well.  They were wrong to go after her for a $3000 suit, which was given to her for a photoshoot.
215 2018-11-15 21:53:14 A friendly reminder - stocks that “squeeze” the highest just because they can, with everybody giddy about how the shorts are getting killed, often fall in an awful vacuum.
216 2018-11-15 21:53:10 Well for a major top, purely on techs, while there's no place for American investors to actually invest other than stocks (well they're cheap compared to bonds + growing + bbs).. I've little doubt new high will be here within a year or two. But if that last bottom is a bottom.. ?
217 2018-11-15 21:52:54 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $PCG, $AMD, $AMD, and $F.

219 2018-11-15 21:51:52 Oh, it's lovely to me.  I'll be happy when it's trading around $85 or lower again.  Tho even there would still be one of more expensive chip stocks.  Never know they might lose the whole move from $40 if they have a sustained Rev. Decel.

237 2018-11-15 21:44:30 Neither Amazon nor Google have the profits Apple does.  Apple is the exception.

A growth stock has to have the real opportunity to continue to grow in price and profits. A retail investor is better off gambling less with high priced growth stocks buying into a dividend all-star.

247 2018-11-15 21:39:44 So bump stocks are a waste and almost no one cares if they are gone so that's fine.

They do actual background checks. Most firearms are purchased through dealers who have to do them. For private sales, that's where they are required by federal law, but I support that.
248 2018-11-15 21:39:41 LOL you take my stocks that I hold onto for you so I do my part 
249 2018-11-15 21:39:21 I will at some point but I would feel more comfortable buying anything for longer hold after a general mkt correction. In any case I definitely won’t be spending all my cash anytime soon, maybe a few nibbles if these stocks stop chopping up and down every week

254 2018-11-15 21:35:57 Been informed today that the massive @MMsWorldStores in London only stocks THREE varieties of M&M’s! That’s not a world, it’s hardly a village. My local shop does more variety than that! Criminal! @mmschocolate
255 2018-11-15 21:35:42 It’s a pity that these data are unofficial, uncorrected & partial. The stocks assessed are less than ten, landing obligation’s gonna start next year for all the species (so no information is now available) and shark and coral trawling fishing are not permitted since a long time
256 2018-11-15 21:35:40 what most didn't realize is that Chip stocks just can't trade at Software multiples for very long and $NVDA just did it longer than any Semi since 1997-2000 timeframe
257 2018-11-15 21:35:36 Maybe circumstances was the wrong word but a crude strategy of mine is taking note of certain stocks & how their price fluctuates over a period of time. Ride the wave buy in & get out when the time comes. For this stock $10-11 is buy in. You're probably shaking your head now 
258 2018-11-15 21:35:34 It’s real! So I’ve started investing in stocks but those earnings won’t come until years from now. I need a freaking quick fix! 
259 2018-11-15 21:35:23 Public meeting at Almondbury library, Stocks Walk, Almondbury 2.30pm this Sunday 18th. Kirklees Council's badly thought out plan to shut beautiful & successful library. Please come & support us & save the library. We need you.
260 2018-11-15 21:35:00 Traders often act (short-term at least) out of irrational, misplaced fears. Thus they took down retail winners like $WMT and $HD today. Let's C where these stocks R trading next week and next month. They're going higher, & today was a rare gift, a fire-sale opportunity.
261 2018-11-15 21:34:25 Between Bitcoin and Stocks this has been a rough week ugh

266 2018-11-15 21:31:40 Hey @FutureMoneyTren how do you feel about your all star lineup of Amir, Bull Dog and Keith? Among others... your bullish calls on their stocks are consistent if nothing else... you followers have lost so much. At least you got paid and have free stock. Awful.
267 2018-11-15 21:30:50 The list goes on... investing in private businesses with clients (who become friends) & invite you to co-invest. It becomes about co-investing and partnering up. This is how HNWIs & family offices are making a killing — while the topic on FinTwit is when will stocks bounce!
268 2018-11-15 21:30:21 And there stocks dropped x%

272 2018-11-15 21:29:48 .@DoreeGraham: in the interview, Trump came out for "comprehensive immigration reform" aka amnesty. That's like if Bernie came out for bump stocks.

Point out to @bennyjohnson fans he didn't call Trump on amnesty. Point out to #MAGA Trump is pro-amnesty. Help make lemonade.

281 2018-11-15 21:27:15 So I could have made the trade to short $NVDA and get 15% now. But I will not short until I actually have a job in this. I want to speak to more people before I consider myself good enough to start shorting stocks.

288 2018-11-15 21:24:32 I am focusing on energy stocks. Today $XOM turned around nicely.
Oil has to stabilize before this market can shoot up. IMHO!
289 2018-11-15 21:23:40 Yes - that is what I was getting at. 

Stocks are tanking as the Fed is pulling the easy money out. If they do their job, that is OK with me if they actually kill inflation. Inflation is already there and has been for years - just not in prices yet.
290 2018-11-15 21:23:13 Your policies are going to hurt America even more especially whenever a Recession hits they are going to lay off triple the amount of people. Obama did that already on wallstreet that’s why ceo just get 40million in stocks loopholes that the Democrats created businesses deals
291 2018-11-15 21:22:56 If you’re buying stocks based on sentiment, you shouldn’t be investing in the market. Go take a look at Snapchat’s financial statement and then tell me if you should still invest. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
292 2018-11-15 21:22:22 All stocks are struggling at the minute. Now is a good time to add more #LVCG to your portfolio if you have spare funds - average down your investment.

293 2018-11-15 21:21:41 $SPY pumps more then penny stocks . Remember the days where it’d pump .63% .40% and futures were promising. $TVIX $UVXY $JDST $JNUG

303 2018-11-15 21:18:44 Yeah man that’s pretty broad don’t you think? Also you can still acquire bump stocks at gun shows. Im aware they are illegal but people still want to make money

325 2018-11-15 21:03:45 Stocks, real estate, gold and corporate bonds are all valued partially as inflation hedges and that part of their value will be erased (in Real terms) if Fiat sees a demonetization towards Bitcoin.

Instead they'll just be risk Investments rather than Subsitute Store of Values.

333 2018-11-15 20:58:09 Today was one of those days when you have to hold on and capitalise. It’s so easy to cash out prematurely when you’ve taken a hit and you’re trying to scrape back the profits and finish in the green. Always stick to your strategy.

358 2018-11-15 20:40:31 Yes, ur correct, but who are they buying their stocks back from?  Retirement funds, Union Strike funds, 401k accounts for working people, and even the Social security funds.
AND Congressmen investors that allow it to happen as well.
359 2018-11-15 20:39:52 It’s too volatile to jump in and out everyday in individual stocks. It’s easy to lose a lot. I think buying some decent ones that were killed and hold is the way to go.

381 2018-11-15 20:25:14 By no means am I arguing with you (i know it *is* twitter). if we think about the correlations as a matrix, there is a connection between stocks & bonds: they are financial.

389 2018-11-15 20:19:58 I believe we are in a lot of ways. And the laughing stocks are all these celebrities and social figures who have an exorbitant amount of money and live better lifestyles then most, and countries around the world are very envious of that because most don't have that opportunity.
390 2018-11-15 20:19:53 I don’t understand what they said. Buy stocks instead then u can help others or enjoy. Indians spend too much money on weddings. Anyway it is a memorable event. No sweat!! Wear a traditional saree

395 2018-11-15 20:17:24 If I can talk stocks for a moment, I am BULLISH on @EA stock. Once #BFV has its full release and #Anthem is released next year, I expect EA stock price will rise. If you are looking at stocks to buy, personally, I like EA. Purely personal, I have no relationship to EA.
396 2018-11-15 20:15:57 $CAVR : still has a DTC chill on it and it’s moving this good. Last two stocks I saw with DTC chills were $HEME and $BYOC. Both ran huge when the chills came off. This is just the start.
397 2018-11-15 20:15:17 Note also how they are different in terms of stocks / flows. Gold sits. Uranium gets used, then sits. Both expensive to keep @cannonball1246

401 2018-11-15 20:12:32 The overall #videogame #market is volatile at the moment. Companies are looking at #mobile devices while trying to balance that with traditional markets.

410 2018-11-15 20:09:05 Look at what the 14% tax cut has done by trumps new plan. It hasn’t helped anyone. Jobs are being created at the same rate as before. Why? Because it went into stocks which helps the rich get richer  they aren’t increasing wages or anything to help the poor.
411 2018-11-15 20:08:48 rachel i’m sorry this was a difficult process for you. i promise you’ll have a much easier time next drop when stocks are higher. dm me if you have any questions i’m happy to help
412 2018-11-15 20:07:43 It isn't just the nominal price. How many stocks priced at $150/share pay quarterly dividends?

A growth stock in that price range can signal many (possible) negatives: too high of P/E, a company unwilling to split, or that the growth phase has slowed.
413 2018-11-15 20:07:40 Yeee very true plus stocks are a gamble period

446 2018-11-15 19:51:29 @jimcramer, you've seen nothing yet
So you seem to be calling a bottom cause you're suggesting this move supersedes the charts and you could not possibly short "FANG + stocks". Come on Jim.  we know this is a head fake
You know short is the way to go here. You "seen nothin'" yet
447 2018-11-15 19:51:09 He's right, absolutely right!  Come on America, get behind this and help the workers out.  Do you care America - or is it just about stocks, dividends, 401ks, IRA's, hedge funds?  Wal Mart works people 40 hours a week and they have to get another job just to pay the dam bills.
448 2018-11-15 19:51:01 That's an interesting point Ray, that you kinda let things settle and you have the same group of people that keep playing that really understand the game I guess.

483 2018-11-15 19:35:23 Exactly. I believe part of that pessimism is driven by the negative macro outlook. Tech stocks look weak across the board and anticipated interest rate hikes in December means there's less cheap capital to go around

496 2018-11-15 19:29:53 No. If bonds are under pressure, keeping in mind where the 10yr yield is trending and stocks are higher- this is bullish.

498 2018-11-15 19:28:34 That being said, I think the next bear market is going to be ugly for U.S. stocks, but even worse for ex-U.S.

546 2018-11-15 19:07:52 It would seem logical that weed stocks are mostly speculation on future sales rather than short term sales.

553 2018-11-15 19:05:51 For perspective, financial assets have had a really good run for years. Both stocks and bonds are fin'l assets. So maybe its time for other assets to have a good run. Maybe commodities, maybe labor assets (wages) -- both are inflation btw; maybe something else
554 2018-11-15 19:05:29 My argument is that going into the settings where things like stocks are to turn them on and off, is obnoxious and will cause accidents in sets. However, its more beneficial to turn them off on everything, because it will give us far more good stages to use.

Bump stocks are not in common use.

682 2018-11-15 18:08:35 You pay a lower tax rate when you get a dividend, you don't pay any on the capital gain until you sell the stock at which point the tax rate is the same as for dividends. The difference is not that big a deal given rapid turnover of stocks

687 2018-11-15 18:05:35 Heck I find it tough to watch the market drop and see my investments fall. Since I am 35 and probably won't retire until I'm 65 I just tell myself things will bounce back. Also since I invest in dividend stocks I now tell myself everything is on sale and look to buy what I can.

Starting to notice "green shoots" in stocks like $ROKU, $TNDM, $ZEN.   Shorts must be tired or fully locked-in? 

Could also be some buyers starting to reappear (or both).
771 2018-11-15 17:28:12 @AOTtrades FAANG stocks still not great.

773 2018-11-15 17:27:00 And this is the perfect add for Kleenex to capitalize upon. In fact the whole Snowflake Movement is their's for the taking & if they don't Puffs will. GO kleenix! I'm allergic to Puffs &  No, I do NOT own stocks in Kleenex My only asset is a jar of Maxwell house full of pennies!
774 2018-11-15 17:25:57 Yeah, blame Russia just because we disagree with Zoro.  And you think Zoror didn't meddle with our politics?  Let's have just one opnion and one speech that agrees with Zoro and supoort whichever politician he supports!  I bet he is  shorting Facebook stocks now?

Extended magazines & bump stocks should be banned though imo.  They serve no purpose outside of enabling easier mass murder

There are other changes I'd implement but what's mentioned above could be legislated the quickest

780 2018-11-15 17:24:15 The overall market seems stuck at S&P 2700. Tech stocks have rebounded slightly but still most remain over 15% below levels at the end of September. Some big tech companies are 25-50% below their highs. This has been one heck of a correction thus far.

782 2018-11-15 17:24:07 While diversification is an important investment concept, being diversified between stocks, bonds, and cash alone may not be enough. A static “buy and hold” approach in a market that is increasingly dynamic is antiquated...
783 2018-11-15 17:23:27 well, systemic in the sense that the entire corporate debt market could come under stress. that would almost certainly spill over to stocks. economy, not so sure, but obviously it poses a downside risk.

786 2018-11-15 17:22:56 Current thoughts: Will USD rally together with or against stocks? Will it at all? Is the precious metal decline just getting started or already over here?

787 2018-11-15 17:22:47 How do you figure it's a scam? Just because it's lost value? 

Nikkei peaked in 1980s and has yet to reach those values. Same is true for many stocks. Do you consider them as scams? 

You might want to re-analyze your position on what a "scam" means.

821 2018-11-15 17:09:42 An overvalued stock market doesn't necessarily mean that equities must fall in the near-term. It means one of 3 things: either (a) stocks will fall; (b) earnings will grow at a faster rate than equities until they balance out; or (c) the market will continue to be overvalued.

915 2018-11-15 16:41:35 My take away was 1) if your stock hits ATL-don't remain invested. Exit and enter again when stock shows turnaround. Will save you from stocks  which never recover. 2)Even if you are bargain hunting don't jump in at ATL. Let it settle. Let it show reversal in trends.

920 2018-11-15 16:39:04 I see clips about Soros investing in Bit Coin. 
His history is about short selling. 
When Bit Coin hit 20,000, and then they
started writing options, and then it fell off the cliff.
The market for B.C. looks to much like penny stocks.
Not fluid enough for an honest market. IMHO.
921 2018-11-15 16:38:59 Stocks with UK exposure got smacked today...QLT, INL, CCO, ITU, HMN...

925 2018-11-15 16:36:48 #ThursdayThoughts FedHead Jerome Powell told the Dallas Federal Reserve last night we can expect to see higher interest rates going forward.  That means financial stocks will take a hit. Another reason for a down day on Wall Street today?.
926 2018-11-15 16:36:44 Stocks are doing fine..
927 2018-11-15 16:36:41 of my friggin goodness, rates at 500 year lows is worrisome for stocks. Stocks are falling for other reasons and all of WS is in a freak out. Maybe sell aTH equities in a subpar global growth circumstance. Idiots, including RD
928 2018-11-15 16:36:28 Another volatile day on #wallstreet - stocks tumbled, but are now well off of their lows - the major averages have bounced off the lows and taken out the day highs to the upside.

934 2018-11-15 16:33:00 This might be a good time to start selling short on banking stocks. Open to correction but I think the debt to banks against land loans is in the order of R3.5 trillion. When I no longer have access to my land,  the bank will no longer have access to their debt. Any thoughts??

955 2018-11-15 16:25:13 Why take account only of 'long-term' changes in forest carbon stocks?

How long is the period of higher carbon levels until the 'long term'?
956 2018-11-15 16:25:08 The retail selloff is a sign larger anxieties about growth and volatility are rippling to other groups, analysts said. It marks a departure from earlier in the year, when steady consumer data reinvigorated retail stocks.

1044 2018-11-15 16:00:09 This is one reason I think the u related stocks haven’t moved significantly yet...other times it was the speculation crowd for a quick pump and dump but this time managers are taking a good look at company’s books and positioning accordingly.

1051 2018-11-15 15:59:20 USD/JPY keeping a nervous eye on stocks
• USD/JPY drifts a little lower as S+P E-minis turn negative
• Range for Asia has been 113.46/67, last at 113.53
• Initial support seen at the 38.2 Fibo of recent rally at 113.13

1055 2018-11-15 15:57:24 Homebuilding stocks are getting clobbered again today.  The Fed inflated the last housing bubble by holding the Fed Funds rate a 1% for a year.  This time the Fed held rates at 0% for 6 years, and after 3 years of hikes, the rate stands at just 2%.  This bubble is much bigger!
1056 2018-11-15 15:57:21 I had written that answer on Jun 7th itself, expecting a cut in fuel excise duty, increase in cost of funds for NBFCs & hence reduced exposure a little bit to banking & financial sector stocks but still got caught in the ILFS mess. Most importantly, YES Bk unfolded differently.

1133 2018-11-15 15:32:33 #stocks $spx risk of buying today is not medium term loss but the missed opportunity of buying even lower if May receives no confidence vote, etc.  But, u may miss boat too. Fear and greed.  I think we hit new highs before year end and so my biggest fear is of missing out.

1143 2018-11-15 15:28:04 Every American that is working is invested in 401K mutual funds that contain stocks in these companies. You are always looking for at least a 10% return. If you don't you buy stock elsewhere. And that is modest considering interest on unsecured debt that is Bank credit cards.
1144 2018-11-15 15:27:43 Huge shoutout to @MommasOptions for calling out cheap $PCG next week's puts. Saving a piece.  Also big shoutout to @SpartanTrading for calling out when $SPY will be choppy. My biggest weakness is trying to play big stocks during a choppy day so this is immensely helpful!

1270 2018-11-15 14:45:34 If we can ban Lawn Darts and Weed then we can ban AR15s, Bump Stocks and other accesseries. If the gov wants to ban Trans Americans from serving their Country, then they can ban AR15s. But sadly we have a Gov not for the People, but for the Religious Right.

1277 2018-11-15 14:43:41 stocks rise by 1%.
1278 2018-11-15 14:43:37 Supply appears to have dried up, I’m seeing stocks up on low volumes. Are there no more sellers?? $COMPQ
1279 2018-11-15 14:43:15 Cisco and Walmart open up on strong  earnings.  Facebook and Amazon drag down major indexes.  Reports are out that China delivered a response to U.S. trade demands.  That should be good news for stocks.  But the Fed meeting yesterday has Wall St. worried about rising rates.
1280 2018-11-15 14:42:57 Helplessly hoping that stocks willl recover from their swoon soon. Or is this stocks’ swan song? Bear and bull. Short and long.  No one’s immune. Alliteration and assonance are the spice of a financial reporter’s life.
1281 2018-11-15 14:42:36 The very few stocks that are currently “trending”, are not available to trade on tradenet... so back to bed it is.

1284 2018-11-15 14:41:29 The best economy?

I think the tata group is good & clean but most of their stocks are terrible investments.

1287 2018-11-15 14:40:13 Stocks open lower. Dow -130 points.
1288 2018-11-15 14:40:02 $mchi went from 40% tech to 2% overnight following the #msci #gics changes as many stocks shifted to communications services. Make sure you look under the hood @martinsmall_ @iShares #etfs

1291 2018-11-15 14:39:03 Another great day for marijuana stocks. Never got into the space & now that there's really one trading opp left, do you put capital at risk?
1292 2018-11-15 14:38:52 @jimcramer You’re sounding like a lunatic this morning! Have you gone short on the markets? Markets don’t have to retest any lows. This is a low level correction and not a bear market! Stop howling at the moon! #Stocks #Markets #CNBC

1294 2018-11-15 14:38:25 FAANG stocks will lead in the coming parabolic blow-off.Could see as much as 50-100% from current levels with AMZN, NFLX & AAPL leading the way & FB probably the laggard. FB may not see new highs but the other four should see very substantial new highs. Market poised for big move
1295 2018-11-15 14:38:17 How does ones get into stocks/bonds/investments?
1296 2018-11-15 14:36:44 Ah. That yes. Not sure if your big on stocks, but NIO showing potential on the charts.
1297 2018-11-15 14:36:39 Stocks open lower again. Hard not to call it a trend at this point. #china in rally mode after solid earnings from tencent. $tcehy Apple a bit higher as its way too cheap. $aapl the rest is red.
1298 2018-11-15 14:36:13 Tim once said if you are not happy with the stocks then get out. Why defend the stock when the analysts have the agenda. Read the balance sheet and that’s the fact you should rely on. Good luck!

1301 2018-11-15 14:35:48 The fact $WMT has been lower this morning is sad. Retailers should have their own market away from lesser, non-consumer stocks.

1308 2018-11-15 14:33:09 I recall having a discussion at the time with the EA about the identity/origin of the naturalised stocks in the UK. They're variously suggested to be amarus or sericeus. Have you compared your fish with any positively-IDed museum specimens?
1309 2018-11-15 14:33:09 To be honest as a very small investor your stocks are cheap as shit and the US is pretty expensive but the risk are either amazing returns or getting nailed in the ass hard if you do a hard Brexit. So yeah a lot are watching like vultures lol
1310 2018-11-15 14:33:00 F*ck these tech stocks bring us down $ACB
1311 2018-11-15 14:32:56 Amazing how my 401k and stocks have majorly dropped since the Dems took the house and all this voting stuff they want to keep blaming it on overseas but I don't see it like that Trump said things would go to hell if the Dems gotten power. I do see it in my 401k
1312 2018-11-15 14:32:49 #Brexit it was always ridiculous to unwind a 50-year relationship based on a 51% majority. I think 50/50 there’ll be another referendum now that Britons can see details of what an EU exit will really mean.  

Chaos but not materially adverse impact on #stocks either way...
1313 2018-11-15 14:32:31 Thank you so much @Tom_Stocks for a lovely chat to help me out with my dissertation, what an absolute pleasure it was to meet you! Keep up the wonderful work you are doing with @actorawareness and best of luck with the rest of your shows for @GreaterGameplay

1317 2018-11-15 14:31:18 Clearly you are running on empty since the stocks are responding to the Midterm elections and divided Congress since most of Trump's tenure has seen stocks booming.
1318 2018-11-15 14:31:07 The NYT article? Love Bowles. He was on KK bod when they were cooking the books. He slid out back door. I shorted all stocks that had ex Clinton’s. Fnm,c and kk. Kk my biggest short win ever. Thx Erskine

1324 2018-11-15 14:27:09 When you were born, or when you started buying stocks/bonds?
Are the majority my investor peers born in 1978 experiencing similar returns to me?
1325 2018-11-15 14:27:07 Can I at least get a proper bear mkt rip in my euro stocks at some point?
1326 2018-11-15 14:26:52 This certainly is beginning to feel like a real bear market.  Stocks open on the highs. Close on the lows.  You buy the dip every day. Lose your ass the entire way.
1327 2018-11-15 14:26:30 Do you think the overall market outlook is weakening? Or is it just a few outlier stocks that are bearish?

1332 2018-11-15 14:25:30 i actually think that preOpen vol spike lower could be a bullish sign for the day in stocks but doubt it averts the selloff

i expect the open to dip a little, pickers to dump and a nice little rally.... that rally is a sell though

1347 2018-11-15 14:18:44 I like Wes’ definition on this-very clean. IMO the “committee” aspect of the S&P 500 is not all significant—the SPX is almost indistinguishable from just a top 500 sort of US stocks by market cap.

1371 2018-11-15 14:07:18 Tech Stocks probably looking for a reversal on Tariff war. Until then under pressure in general. Multiple Bear Market Charts. AAPl CELG NFLX MU etc... A change in Tariff policy would smash market higher.
1372 2018-11-15 14:06:29 Yes it does. The question is one of valuation. If it is easier for early investors to have a liquid way of exiting the market, or if it's easier to sell stocks, then you'll have investors taking risk to invest on unproven ideas and changing it into something tangible
1373 2018-11-15 14:05:24 But if you prefer CFD’s you can always open an account with @HerenyaCapital and get a great platform and a broker that can find you scrip to short on those stocks that aren’t available to you now

1524 2018-11-15 12:44:46 Couldn't Walmart and other companies just circumvent this by lowering CEO pay and giving them stock options as boosters? Potentially, they'd make more because stocks are taxed at a much lower rate than their normal salaries would be at those income levels.
1525 2018-11-15 12:43:42 The conservatives literally want Britain to fail. Why? So they can short stocks, launder Russian money. And I tell you what. None of them is going to lose their ability to go live in Europe. It's just us.
1526 2018-11-15 12:43:10 Willy IMHO what we are seeing in Capital assets, stocks & RE today (broadly speaking) is a reflection of fleeing from USD as a result of loss of store of value. This is underappreciated. You are onto a correct way of thinking as our economy has moved over last 40 years from real

1529 2018-11-15 12:41:47 it's a function of the state of the market. essentially, money has exited the riskier stocks, rapidly in many cases, and at least some of it has been parked in the more stable stocks, pushing some to 52-week highs. in one sense, this action is a measure of the fear of the market.

1600 2018-11-15 11:57:30 Kidding right? Lot's of stocks are supported by social media. What the difference is to me, does the social media bring information or does it blatantly ramp stocks with incorrect info. Many examples of both. I have never seen brendan ramp and drill results there for all to see.
1601 2018-11-15 11:56:48 And the reason why they do it is because they are being incentivised to do so with money. Either as political contributions or as money from lobbyists or as money made from stocks of certain companies which would benefit from their ideological stances. That's exactly the...(2)

1631 2018-11-15 11:37:25 @Sleepless4 maybe, I think signs suggest a recession in 2019*2020. Keeping stocks down for months.. still Long term bullish though..
1632 2018-11-15 11:37:20 $AUPH $KZR Also, I have found that micro cap stocks like KZR that are developing compounds in multiple disciplines (LN and oncology) lessen their chance of success. Must #lazerfocus
1633 2018-11-15 11:37:10 Hope it’s money people are going to use to buy stocks now that they are at a bargain.
1634 2018-11-15 11:36:52 #FTSE100 loves Jezza apparently - you would expect the possibility Corbyn becomes PM to break the traditional sterling down, UK stocks up, right?? #weird .... I mean they are export companies after all, they need trade agreements?

1636 2018-11-15 11:36:12 @Andy_Hoffman_CG I've known you a long time Andy, be careful, it's getting a bit irrational out there. You may blow this like you did your mining stocks 10 years age. Stay solid in physical gold & silver.
1637 2018-11-15 11:36:07 Better had, before we run out of food stocks. Let me know when's good for you and I'll confirm.
1638 2018-11-15 11:35:31 Many stocks traded on the FTSE 100 are international companies, therefore it tends to rise when the pound falls as many traders are working in dollars/euros and the stocks suddenly look cheap by comparison. FTSE 250 (down around 1%) generally a better guide to UK business feeling
1639 2018-11-15 11:34:33 That Sandberg & Zucker used anti-Soros propaganda to save their own & Facebook's behinds/stocks is DISGRACEFUL. I hope @georgesoros rakes them over the legal coals.

1654 2018-11-15 11:25:51 Remember the FTSE100 is no reflection (positively) of the farce unfolding at Westminster. Dominated by international earnings it rises on weak pound. Watch the banks and other domestic stocks all tanking. This is no safe haven, the status quo does not exist. A choice iscoming....

1665 2018-11-15 11:18:55 GDP will be down 6% if we leave. We've lost £26Billion so far, £500 million per week. As part of the EU we have a say in fishing stocks, we won't if we leave. Immigration has always been controlled by the UK government, they choose not to.
1666 2018-11-15 11:18:26 The question is happy. You could pick a hundred stocks on the asx for your personal crusade, so why CLA? Of course he is accountable to shreholders. That's what the share price does.  You are also accountable by your repuation. If CLA ends badly as u suspect then he will wear it.

1696 2018-11-15 10:55:45 Heavy earnings day completely overshadowed by  #Brexit - but if MPs want a glimpse of no-deal Brexit, they can look at housebuilding and bank stocks plummeting. Cautious bank lending and sudden doubt about the value of houses looks like a swift path to a credit crunch.

1863 2018-11-15 08:30:02 My predictions on Pg&e 1) the government will bail them out. 2) they will divide it up n sell it off. 3) one of the big Texas oil companies will buy it for cents on the dollars as the stocks fall. This one is a Hail Mary.. @elonmusk buys the company

2046 2018-11-15 05:32:30 Looks to me like a typical IPO for a strong stock. The first day it spikes on the opening and then insiders dump lots of stock and it crashes.

2092 2018-11-15 04:49:14 I lowered my average entry price from ~10,000 in February to ~6,600 by buying more as the price fell.

And ended up with 5x as much bitcoin now as at the start of the year.

So today lost 5x more than Feb's position.
But those funds would have been in 200% stocks and lost more.

2102 2018-11-15 04:40:12 In these times of high volatility & operator manipulated Cos, I am restricting myself to Largecaps & quality midcaps only. I mostly avoid 'penny' stocks as they hold little value, but 'display inflated' profits & assets. Income from operations is essential, not 'other income'.

2114 2018-11-15 04:33:21 You can't solve a problem based on a false premise. You focus on AR-15s, claim entitlement to bump stocks and talk about restrictions on the right to vote without providing an argument.

It's like me asking why are you defending a position which you know is wrong?
2115 2018-11-15 04:32:50 No automatic rifle has ever been used in a mass shooting on American soil.
Bump stocks are ridiculous on the face of it.
Mental deficient is the term I will use.
There is a difference between someone who is mentally ill and harmless and these murderers.
They are missing something
2116 2018-11-15 04:30:45 I’m not a bear or a bull....I trade charts! Charts right now are bearish...

2121 2018-11-15 04:24:54 lol @Meemaw621 blocked me after i showed her a Vice video saying bump stocks DO NOT make an ar-15 an automatic weapon, again i say, i am not a gun owner, and i hate guns, but i believe in being honest and informed about an issue, not just spout out BS.
2122 2018-11-15 04:24:53 Seriously? Announced closings: Sam’s/Walmart, Sears, Lowe’s etc. Fact: Most companies used tax savings to buy back stocks and in some cases go to automation. No company cancelled moving and many more are now moving overseas. Unemployment is rising. We know who’s winning.
2123 2018-11-15 04:24:23 Why don't we all just drive around in tanks and carry AR-15's with bump stocks and extra capacity magazines.... that would definitely make america great again.... I have goosebumps and visions of apple pie just thinking about it....
2124 2018-11-15 04:24:15 There aren't any buyers as large as China to absorb the massive output that CN once consumed. This is why soybean stocks are piling up in U.S. grain silos. This is a $14 billion annual business that is going to disappear (speaking of just soy alone).

2208 2018-11-15 03:22:14 @jazziestar99 hey there, may I ask how long you have been doing stocks now? What was your initial investment?
2209 2018-11-15 03:21:13 I often wonder why stocks like $ARGQ get no market interest. They have zero dilution, financing at a .02 minimum price. Should announce another fund acquisition before the end of 2018. Should obtain bigger 10 million financing before the end of 2018 probably at a .02 share price.
2210 2018-11-15 03:21:09 Crash the stocks price and buy up your dissidents shares who couldn't financially hold out long enough.. The 1% are laughing... they already have essentially 80% of the coins...
2211 2018-11-15 03:20:41 In 2009 the Canadian Company sold part of their shares to the Russian Company. Other than preserving the rights to the ore we lost all advantage in 2007. This was during Bush Administration before Obama HRC. In 2013 all stocks were owned by RussianCo
2212 2018-11-15 03:20:11 (Thanks for the vote.) As to the issue, what law do you want to pass that would make a difference? Regulating bump stocks the same as automatic weapons, I agree with that.

2213 2018-11-15 03:19:11 I'm pretty sure once they start losing money like crazy, they'll change their mind.  If their stocks are dropping like they are now, they'll have to do something. Whether it'll be a positive or a negative for us, that's a whole another thing.
2214 2018-11-15 03:18:36 Their stocks are still dropping fast, so it's not exactly "through the crisis". They are going to be dismantled. #DeleteFacebook

2232 2018-11-15 03:08:48 But it'll be great for the gun market! They'll have to sell tons to cover all those places. And then everyone will be so worried about there being guns everywhere, that lots of non-gunowners will feel the need to go buy one. Good time to invest in gun stocks.

2243 2018-11-15 03:02:05 Are you missing some marbles? Headlines like these cause panic in the market and since these stocks are mainly driven by retail investors, they typically sell on fear. This publication, should be called Market NO Watch.
2244 2018-11-15 02:59:43 True. But we can say that about real estate, stocks, etc. All investments need new money to continue to grow.
2245 2018-11-15 02:59:03 Anita, you gotta lose the analyst consensus thing. That's just biased, tightly managed sell-side crap, and utterly meaningless. Just start reading up on the companies that people always call in about. Same 20 stocks 80% of the time.  :)

2250 2018-11-15 02:56:49 Thanks for the input. It seems like the indexes have been hiding a bear market in stocks the past year. So many stocks have been crushed, and I haven't seen so many good setups in years. Lots of family/friends been asking me if they should get out...

2264 2018-11-15 02:50:47 Agree that's the way, but unfortunately, some 75% of people didn't prepare like that & instead - depended on assets in their property, (which tanked) due to a number of factors. And, many people lost jobs to poor trade treaties, invested in losing stocks, mutal funds, etc.

2268 2018-11-15 02:50:30 It definitely could. $AAPL and $AMZN are the most widely owned stocks in the US (and the world for that matter). One is a missed product cycle away from disaster, other is a major valuation bubble. Collapse in either would result in domino effect across ETFs and passive investors
2269 2018-11-15 02:50:11 $TLRY $CRON $CGC  All stocks bounce however the first run was the easy money. This is not that and will get hyped (as all Eiffel towers do) all the way down i.e $GBTC $HMNY etc.  Another stock, same story.

2273 2018-11-15 02:45:35 And Nike and Dick's sporting goods.  In both cases the stocks have increased more than the Dow since (the day before) the boycott was announced.   Next chance I will buy shares in a publicly traded company as soon as the MAGAts call for a boycott.

2298 2018-11-15 02:28:55 Not exactly.  A company can be a good value based on earnings, but if it's not growing revenues and earnings it's not a growth stock.  With that said, many growth stocks become value stocks once they stop growing quickly.

2301 2018-11-15 02:26:40 MOSL Wealth Creation Studies 2017.

Section 8.1 (Page 35) brings out some key industry & company-level factors which may serve as a checklist to evaluate the long-term prospects of all companies.

Worth reading & implement while analyzing stocks.

Ignore the stock name discussed.
2302 2018-11-15 02:26:30 No. No. No. Read a paper. Better yet talk to people. My husband was up for a better job that disappeared with the tariffs. When stocks are up or doesn't necessarily mean better lives for regular people.  Most economist, even conservatives, think the economy is in danger.
2303 2018-11-15 02:25:53 To be honest I didn’t love that book. I felt like there was too much story. Have you read Jesse Livermore’s other book, How To Trade In Stocks?
2304 2018-11-15 02:23:33 i'm so annoyed by the exo/rv discourse going on like shut the fuck up both fandoms we honestly don't know shit about sm's internal affairs and what stocks they choose to release so stop arguing about who "pays the electricity bill" and support your favs quietly

2311 2018-11-15 02:19:54 Wonder what happens if  lots of stakeholders dropped @Google stocks? 
2312 2018-11-15 02:19:29 Yup. Just a cycle. Companies are like living organisms man. Growth stocks are teenagers that are still finding themselves but have lots of potential; value stocks already have a spouse and kids and you can depend on them to keep it together... most of the time.
2313 2018-11-15 02:19:13 Idk with $aapl and other momentum stocks like this $wmt ain’t gonna save the day
2314 2018-11-15 02:18:39 Yeah I'd definitely be ok with that. Melee's been doing it for years with Yoshi's being legal. With more stocks, it gives us the ability to die early, but still come back. I think we need to have at MINIMUM one tiny stage, and one large stage. Blastzones are so important.
2315 2018-11-15 02:18:09 U.S Market Check

U.S. stocks fell for a fifth straight day as investors remained on edge over trade, political turmoil and economic growth.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 3.12 percent.
2316 2018-11-15 02:17:58 They bought their own stocks. Making the wealthiest stockholders wealthier including executives in those companies. I don't mind executives making money. I do mind them making money at the taxpayer's expense.
2317 2018-11-15 02:17:52 Asian stocks opened mixed after U.S. equities declined and Treasuries  stabilised following gains amid a renewed bout of risk aversion in  American markets.

Japan equities fell, while Australia’s market was little changed. Futures were higher in China and Hong Kong.

Now cheers to that!
Good morning & Happy #endofearningseason! #stocks #stockstowatch
2331 2018-11-15 02:07:53 I also didn't mention $GIN / I'm an investor - I invest to make money - and I've owned many projects/stocks over the years. I also wish to help people understand/avoid bad investments.
2332 2018-11-15 02:07:49 I also take into consideration the incident report that was filed and the fact their stocks have dropped 20% 

Please, get with the program.
2333 2018-11-15 02:07:31 They are a publically traded company. The amount of B Share stocks he owns gives him the power and control that I spoke of.
2334 2018-11-15 02:05:51 I think there's a rotational thing going on. Some sectors sure feel like a bear market, but overall stock supply is shrinking, companies still have lots of money, & I think most people would still rather be in stocks than bonds. I'm more defensive, but not bear market defensive.
2335 2018-11-15 02:05:45 this is literally fake all that happened was another company bought out mbk in stocks back in july and it's just being finalised now,, everything is the same
2336 2018-11-15 02:05:15 A bunch of us are saying that.But we want gun regulations that actually matter & aren’t just designed to make people feel like they are doing something. I support regulating bump stocks like automatic weapons & banning felons and those convicted of hate crimes from getting guns.
2337 2018-11-15 02:05:07 prison stocks were not the best performers after the 2016 election, benefiting trump supported private prison profiteers, so they won't make money from empty cells, in new prisons.  c'mon, man.  wake up.  you're being played by trump for support among our community.
2338 2018-11-15 02:04:23 All Q2 results are out for my portfolio stocks. 

2-3 smallcaps have come out with decent results. Shows that the economy is slow but not contracting as of now.
2339 2018-11-15 02:02:34 My goal is to be on stocks to trade one day
2340 2018-11-15 02:01:43 So, let me get this straight: 

They thought the more stocks they bought the more money they would receive?
2341 2018-11-15 02:01:19 I guess the point here is that crypto market caps shouldn't be used as a valuation metric the same way they are for stocks. Even the bitcoin market cap accounts for many bitcoins that are assumed to be lost (e.g. Satoshi's coins)
2342 2018-11-15 02:00:58 missed ya today Ali. Stocks were wobbly, needed some insights.
2343 2018-11-15 02:00:46 Poor ninty stocks.
2344 2018-11-15 02:00:30 @DaveRamsey was another huge Influence.

He introduced me to the emergency fund.

I used to pour all my $ into stocks. had nothing to fall back on if something major went wrong IE flooded basement, car accident, leaky roof.

Dave brought the 3-6 month emerg. fund into my world
2345 2018-11-15 02:00:20 basically, it was the new stock hotness and people invested in it but no one actually used bitcoin to buy stuff that wasn't drugs, they just cared about the stocks
2346 2018-11-15 01:59:40 No.  But I don't do much on technicals -- mostly value stocks
2347 2018-11-15 01:59:03 In the US employment is at 50 year high and inflation is a low point, we are at the end of an 8 year run in stocks. We are at the peak now,  there may still be some money to be made, but it can't go on too much longer.
2348 2018-11-15 01:57:27 Stocks are fallinggggg harddd
2349 2018-11-15 01:55:47 Ay puta nakarma ako. Imbes kasi na trabaho inaatupag nagtetrade na stocks gagu. hahahaha. bawi bawi.
2350 2018-11-15 01:55:46 @jimcramer I understand #AAPL weighing on lot of chip stocks. But why #AMZN? What does AMZN has to do with AAPL? 
2351 2018-11-15 01:55:36 So how much did the stocks drop in total value?
2352 2018-11-15 01:55:17 $AAPL  I love Apple they've been one of the best performing stocks in the last three months. But from where I stand, I am sell bias $178
2353 2018-11-15 01:54:23 Buying some shares in two small cap stocks tomorrow.
2354 2018-11-15 01:54:05 Sometimes, very few times. I feel a tad envy for the average drone who only thinks about the weekend and sports on tv. No worries about running a company, no worries about stocks or huge life goals. But then I remember why I do what I do. #thankyougod #beyourownboss
2355 2018-11-15 01:53:51 okay hear me out:

3 stocks 7 min
All jank stages legal (within reason)

2356 2018-11-15 01:53:08 @Starbucks you guys give me free ice + water and let me use your wifi to upload instagram pics and read your stocks on your newspaper...ill never forget you
2357 2018-11-15 01:52:55 you know you’re growing up when you actually use the stocks app that comes with your phone
2358 2018-11-15 01:52:48 @czav @istry555 all stocks should open minus the dividend on the ex-dividend date. This isn’t always the case.
2359 2018-11-15 01:52:38 Tax cut went straight to corporate pockets, stocks will crash now with Trump idiotic tariffs, revenues are horrific for fully employed economy...Trump crash on its way, or here already
2360 2018-11-15 01:52:29 I still ask, isn’t selling stocks when they go down the wrong thing to do? I always heard, buy low, sell high. If you are investing for the long term, it makes sense to just hold. Stocks have averaged 7% return per year for the last 80 years. Timing the market doesn’t work.
2361 2018-11-15 01:52:17 also own vff/t & love your enthusism for the company & prospects going forward, but Pot Sector is brutal now & with shorts having ammo of over valued companies with lousy Q results, I think Pot stocks are still going way lower;hope I am wrong
2362 2018-11-15 01:52:05 I am out of all $UGAZ and $DGAZ positions. Not worth the risk. Sticking to stocks
2363 2018-11-15 01:51:47 US stocks continued falling...
Crude just around fallen levels...
Dollar index correcting below 97 level
Metals remaining recent lows..
Expect Indian markets to weaken and correct recent rise.
2364 2018-11-15 01:50:51 Fuck shit! Stocks are falling cause of Flipping Democrats. Get @RepMaxineWaters the HELL out!
2365 2018-11-15 01:50:23 ONHAND
DAMI NA NMN PONG STOCKS 

Grab urs baby
2366 2018-11-15 01:50:11 Ehh it’s up to you. Stocks will probably drop 20% in the next few months. Just a predictions but because of unemployment and how “good” the economy is doing right now it’s a little shady. Interest rates are also slowly peaking.
2367 2018-11-15 01:48:28 Jason sold Sonny his stocks in elq years ago edward had a fit
2368 2018-11-15 01:47:35 you should try Stash. I bought stocks when ole Musky smoked a blunt on JRE and stock dropped. I made profit already
2369 2018-11-15 01:47:02 15 stocks invested by the end of 2020 insha’Allah
2370 2018-11-15 01:46:40 Smh they watch me and copy my moves
So I end up switching my profession and now I trade shares and stocks and they still trying to figure out how. And this life you got to make your own lane and you got to do s*** people don't do
2371 2018-11-15 01:45:23 As of 9:40a.m., PSEi 6,916.87 down 6.21 points or 0.09 percent #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2372 2018-11-15 01:43:01 So I guess I should take my money out of the market tomorrow. Stocks will go down all because of this statement...and the economy is healthy.
2373 2018-11-15 01:42:13 Ce n'est pas macron qui le vend. Faut s'en prendre à ceux qui ne répercutent pas les baisses aux pompes même si il faut attendre le renouvellement des stocks. Les acteurs de ce secteur d'activité se portent merveilleusement bien.
2374 2018-11-15 01:41:14 A3 I love giving gloves and scarfs because they are pratical and everyone loses one glove a season so we need to replenish our stocks. #Danier
2375 2018-11-15 01:41:07 I See Nintendo stocks have fallen quite dramatically. 
2376 2018-11-15 01:41:05 Hopefully you guys have enough stocks for late buyers.
2377 2018-11-15 01:40:22 November 15, 2018: PSEi opened at 6,912.19 #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2378 2018-11-15 01:40:21 Let’s invest in these stocks, then go vacay on a yacht
2379 2018-11-15 01:39:56 I'm honestly not sure I pay Bradley   

Like, maybe he makes something off my stocks? The ones that stayed with him even after I left the company cuz I cant touch the account til I retire? 
2380 2018-11-15 01:38:52 There is a thing indicating how many stocks at the top of the CSS and people still mess it up for singles/doubles changes
2381 2018-11-15 01:38:46 Canadian Pot stocks? Yes or no?
2382 2018-11-15 01:38:20 I totally would, but investments are locked in right now! Besides the bit in current stock, all funds are going to trying to start our Gamedev business. :)

It's hard but I feel possibly a more secure bet than stocks right now, ha ha.
2383 2018-11-15 01:38:10 I love life, rich or poor. I just love life! Almost a total disconnect from money, obviously strange for a guy trading stocks to survive. That bump on the head either fixed me or ruined me. I have a quiet gentle respect for life and people. 
#Life #Consciousness is FREE #joy
2384 2018-11-15 01:36:41 He is a man on a mission.   Crash the market.   Don't fight the fed and buy stocks.
2385 2018-11-15 01:34:38 Nice pick ..I like $OGI among gazillions of #CAMJ stocks.

Best of luck! 
2386 2018-11-15 01:34:30 Yep, you know what’s crazy is I did pretty damn good with penny stocks. Soon as I went to big fish I basically got smoked. Always wondered if I’d just stayed in penny land.
2387 2018-11-15 01:32:57 Think only a handful of coins will run next time. "fool me once" kind of thing. It'll be a shake out, like Tech stocks were shaken out in 2001. Survival of the good projects.
2388 2018-11-15 01:32:39 What's going to happen to PG&E? There stocks down 50%. If they are going to stay as the supplier of gas & electric than wouldn't it make sense to buy that stock one of these days? I think we should get rid of them myself for incompetence. We should socialize gas & electric in CA.
2389 2018-11-15 01:32:01 Alright now be honest, who all has thought about dumping Cryptos, and going into POT Stocks?!

Feel free to list your favorite weed stock! (no government agency ever looks at my account anyway )
2390 2018-11-15 01:31:20 Just tell me where the dem’s are placing their stock bets.  I totally missed the 2008-2016 rise of healthcare stocks, because I didn’t correlate Dem agenda=Dem company growth.  Mea culpa.  BTW, do members ofCongress have to declare their investments?
2391 2018-11-15 01:31:13 A WORD FROM THE BOND PITS:<br>
<br>
Mortgage Bonds closed higher in price and tighter on spread vs Treasuries as Stocks continued in their s
2392 2018-11-15 01:30:49 Dems controlling the lower house and look at where we’re at before they even get off the starting line. Stocks (401Ks) are as low as they’ve been in a year, our military can’t win a conventional war with China or Russia, tons of illegals invading. Fat chance any will get fixed!

2396 2018-11-15 01:28:34 Wow, Twitter apparently now thinks high-capacity magazines are constitutionally protected. I wonder if silencers, bump stocks, and pink-colored holsters are, too.
2397 2018-11-15 01:28:31 I started dabbling in 08 as well.  Good ol’ penny stocks!

2399 2018-11-15 01:26:10 I usually wait for 2-3 candles after cross for entry. It works very well just have to be lucky and be looking at the right stocks on the day

2403 2018-11-15 01:22:21 Scott Melbye:  Care to change your mind on your happiness & joy over your dilution policy? UEC is now less than a nickel to your 52 wk low. Hmm?  Plenty of sector stocks are close to highs. So, UEC lost $0.50/sh X 224 mil shs = $112 mil lost in shareholder value for $20 mil.
2404 2018-11-15 01:21:42 Better sell those Canadian $weed stocks

2406 2018-11-15 01:21:11 Was going to start educating myself about stocks and investing but instead I’ve become obsessed with the astrological signs
2407 2018-11-15 01:21:09 So if stocks collapse, most of the Chinese fishers in the SCS will presumably continue to receive the same govt support they already are. And the economic and food security impact on China will be minimal since SCS isn't a prime source of Chinese fish anyway.
2408 2018-11-15 01:20:58 Who is adulterating?
I can see why there’s a “fire sale” given existing stocks but didn’t OMCs see this coming?
Some of them were on the forefront of asking for a parity with diesel.
2409 2018-11-15 01:20:38 Some quick advise from the stuff I’ve learned through my research is don’t waste your money on materialistic objects especially in things that lose value. Instead of buying that 60k car look into stocks and other investments.

2411 2018-11-15 01:19:43 Admittedly this is the first stagelist a big TO has put up that didn't make me want to throw up. How do you plan on having some Hazards off and some on? Assuming that it all has to be changed within where the stocks are. Do you think that will slow down the pace of sets if so?
2412 2018-11-15 01:17:49 @Patrick_Fenelon seriously he is like one of the best off ball defenders I’ve ever seen. he has basically a preternatural to get STOCKS

2420 2018-11-15 01:11:52 I just watched an interview with the subject who believes she’s the 2nd African American female to trade stocks on the #NYSE. That’s false.

2424 2018-11-15 01:06:29 I sat back an watched the markets run today. I was just looking at stocks where I would have gotten in at. And I am anticipate trades instead of waiting for confirmation. Plus I’ve been over trading but with that evening said I’ll be back in action tomorrow. Fuckin Emotions man
2425 2018-11-15 01:05:47 $TSLA is a good growth stock. Will it drop heavily again sometime through the history of mankind. All stocks will. But, one with 23% short interest is simply that much more likely to drop.
2426 2018-11-15 01:05:25 Senator you voted for @realDonaldTrump tax cut which really benefits the wealthy & rich corporations. Almost daily I read of another large company using their tax savings to buy back their own stocks and not giving their employees a pay raises. Trillion dollars added to our debt.

2430 2018-11-15 01:04:28 Bump stocks.
2431 2018-11-15 01:04:23 Exactly.  If people are going into stocks, they won't be going into crypto.  So much for mass adoption.
2432 2018-11-15 01:02:30 European stocks fell on Wednesday as the impact of trade wars slowed German economic growth and the spat between Italy's populist government and the EU over fiscal targets continued.

2436 2018-11-15 01:01:24 most all pot stocks are dropping bad, even with good earnings reports
2437 2018-11-15 01:01:13 Some really big hedge funds were down 8-10% in Oct.-Those were big in tech-so other hedge funds know your book and will short those stocks to put them out of business-
2438 2018-11-15 01:00:52 US stocks fell on Wednesday as weary investors digested renewed trade tensions and the consequences of political gridlock in Washington. The fall came despite data showing core inflation rising slightly less than expectations

2440 2018-11-15 00:59:50 "The bull market I saw as a sunny summer camp filled with powerful athletes. But I had to remember that some stocks were stronger than others. The bear market? The summer camp had changed to a hospital. The great majority of stocks were sick— but some were more sick than others".
2441 2018-11-15 00:59:38 Some real oddballs:

30 rando large caps, price weighted using arbitrary cost per share

Collection of 100 companies that happened to decide to list on a certain exchange but trade on all

500 largest stocks in the US, except 75 have been replaced w others for unknown reason
2442 2018-11-15 00:59:01 Yes with one more week of competition in August. I’d suggest investing in local hospital stocks.
2443 2018-11-15 00:57:54 All the stages listed in that picture have hazards off. That’s the rule set.
3 stocks, 8 minutes, hazards off
2444 2018-11-15 00:55:04 too many stocks currently "no bueno"
2445 2018-11-15 00:54:41 same here - took loss - odd, that nat gas stocks did not move up with it today,,,
2446 2018-11-15 00:54:37 @tomwfranck how is Andrew left short. The borrow on these stocks are almost non existent. He is full of  $hit he might be long outs but that’s not a real short
2447 2018-11-15 00:53:52 Just short GS on principle, it’s a great hedge. They prolly short themselves, idk...

I think it’s crazy that investment firms are also stocks.
2448 2018-11-15 00:53:23 I’m going to need to invest into @amazon stocks! Cause they for sure the true money team ! Ookkuurrrr
2449 2018-11-15 00:52:57 been wanting to learn more about stocks.  maybe it's time to learn
2450 2018-11-15 00:51:48 If @Entercom stocks keep plunging he won’t be winning for too long 
2451 2018-11-15 00:51:09 Be it stocks or cryptos - says a lot about people who get such glee out of watching average investors lose significant money. Especially when they don’t celebrate when average investor makes money.
2452 2018-11-15 00:50:46 US banks stocks all dropped today. They could be reshuffling into XRP ;)
2453 2018-11-15 00:50:32 Please, he plans to sell 99% of his FB stocks because he knows it's reached its peak.
2454 2018-11-15 00:50:26 Well, sorry but he did say something to the effect of putting stricter laws for background checks and banning bump stocks.
2455 2018-11-15 00:48:14 "Take their stocks before they take yours" is a universal truth
2456 2018-11-15 00:47:36 There’s no room for spectaculars here anymore trade like you do stocks now period ! Ima rape this market from swing trading it
2457 2018-11-15 00:47:12 Ratio of indices to stocks?
2458 2018-11-15 00:47:10 When stock markets are down 10%, down 1.2% is like a safe haven. But stocks, rates and building approvals are lead indicators of the economy while property bulls take with lag indicators like unemployment and low delinquencies - rear view mirror investing
2459 2018-11-15 00:46:35 Question! If theres really a sell off in the equity market, which will result in and increase in USD as stocks and bonds are converted to the dollar,

With that backdrop of a stronger dollar, will Gold as a crisis hedge still prevail? since its GLD/USD relationship
2460 2018-11-15 00:46:07 Can I be the first to say, well that seems unnecessary.
2461 2018-11-15 00:45:22 For giving us a record-breaking economy, record low unemployment, record his stocks and no new wars. Sounds like great karma coming his way
2462 2018-11-15 00:41:51 share price changes over time, so counting shares added or sold is misleading read of idea conviction; focus on new $ committed to idea vs other stocks.  $AAPL is his largest holding by dollar value; his largest allocation, his strongest conviction for best returns.
2463 2018-11-15 00:41:17 Likewise but my only concern with illiquid stocks like that is if & when markets turn to shite it's hard to get out so am always extra cautious there too

GL with it all...
2464 2018-11-15 00:41:09 Only a China trade deal can save the bull run in #stocks now since the Feds may still increase rates. @cnbc @msnbc @realDonaldTrump
2465 2018-11-15 00:40:58 Because they follow the dividend stocks not the insurance stocks....

Warren uses insurance as hedge from the very beginning.
And is an issue I don't fully understand yet, but I'd like to.
Doy you know somebody who could explain it better? Please!
2466 2018-11-15 00:40:55 Crazy times. For stocks: good or bad news=bad news. For bitcoin good or bad news= good news

2468 2018-11-15 00:38:46 Why are stocks and cryptos directly correlated? Both seem to be going down and down... Which could only mean that all the "free money" printed has gone to inflate both stocks, cryptos.. Correct?

2474 2018-11-15 00:35:58 Dividen tu datang dari fund yg kita laburkan dalam ASB. Fund ASB pulak ada fund manager yg manage, utk laburkan di mixed assets mcm equity, income stocks etc. Yelah sbb kita nak invest sendiri belum ckup ilmu kan. Jadi ASB tu salah satu pilihan utk memyimpan & jd investor jugak
2475 2018-11-15 00:35:34 Unfettered capitalism is our nation’s Achilles heel. 
Time to cap the differential between the lowest employee’s salary and the highest owner’s (or exec) salary ... including bonuses, stocks, and other compensation.
2476 2018-11-15 00:34:02 I catch more fish and ride stocks even better
2477 2018-11-15 00:33:35 I've been saving money for the first time in my life, and just invested in my first stocks. Shit's weird.
2478 2018-11-15 00:33:33 It’s sad that DDG has more ambition than our club as a whole! @ManUtd are just satisfying their commercial partners and no more. People might slate me for this but I want our stocks to crumble and deals to be cancelled by the likes of @adidas Hit Glazers where it hurt them #MUFC

2480 2018-11-15 00:32:04 you mean:
1) listen to Peter stubbornly avoid stocks for a decade
2) take Peter's advice
3) stay poor
2481 2018-11-15 00:31:16 Have any Canadians checked their Bieber stocks lately?
2482 2018-11-15 00:30:32 Yeah but considering most stocks are down 10 to 15% over the last week I think anything green on volume or staying stable is doing very well imo. The $200k buy at .025 the other day wouldn't have been retail.
2483 2018-11-15 00:26:06 It's an exciting space. One thing I would suggest, is to keep some exposure to stocks/shares, not just full crypto :). Diversify. Although eToro is not the best for crypto, I really struggle to think of somewhere better to trade stocks :).

2486 2018-11-15 00:23:41 Welcome to Stocks 101, biotech. This is how the whole market trades now. One can assign narratives to everything in retrospect but there is a randomness to the way sentiment shifts and takes hold that is not really understandable or predictable, frankly.
2487 2018-11-15 00:23:36 Will check the charts of all metal stocks and decide.. can't say anything from news... It's not reliable.

Or something like JNJ?

2492 2018-11-15 00:19:40 CNBC been shamelessly pumping this crap since December. Now its the pot stocks...no shame, but it is criminal. What about it BK and Tim?
2493 2018-11-15 00:19:14 So I just bought some stocks? 
2494 2018-11-15 00:19:06 This is a business news emergency broadcast. Today Executive Official  Buck of  The Hershey Company stated in a press release, "The Republicans are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  AMZN stocks". Thank you for tuning into  BBC.
2495 2018-11-15 00:17:59 index funds are going to totally bail from the economy because they either long or out...there is going to be a gigantic shift  in the financial system sooner than you think into crypto.  Hedge funds are taking profits Bitcoin for margin calls on the ongoing crash in stocks.
2496 2018-11-15 00:17:42 @realDonaldTrump Stocks not doing well at all. Please fix.
2497 2018-11-15 00:16:58 I have a great idea ... instead of trying to regulate machine guns, bump stocks, extended clips and straw purchases, let's regulate the @NRA.

Regulate them into oblivion.
Seriously. Tax gun purchases so heavily that states have enough money to care for their victims.

More unloved stocks looking better as past leaders fall apart and rotation happens.
2504 2018-11-15 00:13:45 Hope #2 happens so I can finally buy some pot stocks of companies I've actually verified have good weed.
2505 2018-11-15 00:13:41 stocks rise by 1%.

2508 2018-11-15 00:11:35 All people can do is average down if  they can and wait out the storm . Or cut thier losses as we are seeing in most move on. Myself I am not worried about the stocks I am in. They Will just keep on growing and generate more revenue . Market is a bitch sometimes .
2509 2018-11-15 00:10:16 If stocks go below $10 per share, I will put the entirety of my net worth into pG&E because they will never be allowed to go under and they are a state sanctioned monopoly. #fuckPGandE
2510 2018-11-15 00:10:01 If the FED described the economy and labor market  strong that means an interest rate hike will come. Central bank will hike in December, especially if stocks remain a recovery.

2517 2018-11-15 00:06:42 Yes
2518 2018-11-15 00:05:24 I hope it turns out well. I love my Rugers. I worked hard to sell you on the brand. I’ve heard the stocks on the Americans leave something to be desired. All of mine are M77s.
2519 2018-11-15 00:05:08 it worked for stocks 
2520 2018-11-15 00:04:38 Yes
2521 2018-11-15 00:04:32 The Stock Market isn't the economy. The Fed's job isn't to buoy stocks.
2522 2018-11-15 00:03:57 Hi there! Our members don't pick the stocks ... our award-winning fund managers do :-)  ... but we give members the choice of being able to put a safe portion of the super into industries that they care about. 
Sorry to hear it's not for you...many of our members love it!
2523 2018-11-15 00:03:42 Stocks going to be down!!!
2524 2018-11-15 00:03:25 Right now, stocks move in opposite direction to said long term goal of free and fair trade.

The US economy can withstand the standoff better. It was always about how much pain and pressure US can withstand politically (C knows)

Again factions
2525 2018-11-15 00:03:04 I think it is possible that stocks tank if they stop hiking up bc signaling slowing growth, long way from raising to easing. Maybe a quick rally that fails
2526 2018-11-15 00:02:57 Notional loss can become a permanent loss if you’re holding junk. Not all stocks rebound again. Remember permanent loss of capital is the biggest enemy of compounding.
2527 2018-11-15 00:02:54 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Fun show, now I know what bears got to do.. Glad you talked to my man from CISCO. Did he say AWS? I swear he did? That would make 1 real good team.3 stocks u will only have to have.Great he mentioned CISCO Schools. Gives us an edge. AWS,CISCO,Mcsft?AWS?
2528 2018-11-15 00:02:16 Obviously the government draws the line it automatic weapons which is why this guy had bump stocks
2529 2018-11-15 00:01:48 Where was the stocks at when that piss poor democrat left office and where are they now? Can you do the math or do you need help?
2530 2018-11-15 00:01:10 Rick, would you consider an investor that holds an individual or perhaps a few individual stocks for 10, 20, or 30 years without a single trade to be a passive or active investor?

2534 2018-11-15 00:00:02 Re: Powell
If FOMC plans seen as changing due to flexibility from less inflation, stocks likely rally.
If FOMC plans seen as changing because of economic weakness (global or domestic), stocks likely to suffer.
