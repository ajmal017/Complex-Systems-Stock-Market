4 2018-07-20 23:59:22 日本人が海外の取引所の利用は×、日本の取引所から海外の取引所にコイン送金も基本的には×のはず
取引所ってアービトラージで利益上げてるって何かで読んだことあるんだけど国内法的には当然×だよね？
この辺どうなってんだろ？
正味な話し(･д･)？？

7 2018-07-20 23:59:10 Every dog has its day, I’ve been 100% in ALT’s since December  my mate has just finally changed strategy now for all BTC. If I did the same, needless to say alts would get 1000% over night and BTC would not move lol
8 2018-07-20 23:59:01 I think blowing account is a more relevant to someone running a signal service, not an education class fwiw. Also I know sports is not an analog argument to trade but see mr @DrewHanlen as a great example and a highly respected coach leading in his field.

17 2018-07-20 23:57:37 Okay okay. What can I do to convince you to hold for AT LEAST 2 years? Remember 1. Tron isn’t even a year old yet 2. Justin’s roadmap spans a few years. 3. International governments are just now figuring out how crypto works 4. FUCKING BITTORRENT.

22 2018-07-22 23:59:11 The 4 or 5 richest people in the world are worth more than the entire crypro market therein lies the biggest issue right now. When just 10% of the world put just 10% of their retirement savings into crypto, this will be a $10 trillion market, whales will lose their power

46 2018-07-21 23:58:19 That’s a very low bar.  Easy to find cryptocurrencues with multiple competing client implementations but with centralized economic control due to PoW or PoS consensus control.  Economic control matters more than any other type of centralization for the leading crypto use cases.

145 2018-07-21 23:42:24 So, this study is a bit terrifying at first, but it basically says some toxic elements have a higher concentration in vapes in comparison to regular cigs but some are also lower. And that it depends a lot on what device and e-liquids you're using.

165 2018-07-21 23:39:46 Educational system is flawed Rob! Kids need to learn outside of the classroom meeting people building relationships and learning how to utilize resources to be successful in life so they can later pass this information off to their children. The system needs change!

One thing you guys need to make clearer is the connection between earning "bolts" and the storm tokens which are traded for BTC or FIAT. Offering 125,000 bolts for referrals means nothing to most people

306 2018-07-21 23:16:33 No argument RE: Support for Entrepreneurs and motivating them, I’m a huge believer in entrepreneurship and think #blockchain and #crypto are fantastic tools to help them raise funds and run their businesses
307 2018-07-21 23:16:32 It's not a small detail though. Claiming to be 100% decentralized when in reality being massively centralized is a showstopper in crypto. And it's not as simple as a single error, they are still lying about this to this day.

309 2018-07-21 23:16:18 珍しいな。それはPeerCoinだ。どっから拾って来たんだ？それは世界初の「Proof of Stake」で動く通貨だ。ビットコインの採掘電気代がもったいないから、管理者をそのまま「金持ち」に委任したシステムだな。だけどこれには弱点があって、買い占めが起こると価値が下がるんだ。

315 2018-07-21 23:15:14 But they tried to discourage us by saying #Bitcoin is a fraud. But now, they are taking over crypto world. This is just a case of "If you can't beat them, join them"
316 2018-07-21 23:15:02 Yes. The interests of the miners, investors, Crypto traders, and etc align for a fraud proof Bitcoin. The network is 9 years old and most successful 51% attacks happen to chains that are less than 2 years old. Also, the energy costs are prohibitive to potential 51% attackers.

340 2018-07-21 23:10:57 At the beginning, Bitcoin was a rallying cry to those who wanted an alternative to government, monopolies and politics.

But it now does more that unite us - it grows the movement. It brings new people into the fold.

Crypto is the new activism!

425 2018-07-21 22:58:25 Awesome stuff guys well done @IGivNoFks
426 2018-07-21 22:57:41 Taking payments is fine.  You worked hard to build an audience.  The problem is responsible disclosure which you are supposed to do.
427 2018-07-21 22:57:34 Thank you sir! I really appreciate that very much!
428 2018-07-21 22:57:32 Apparently a by product of wider reach...  also at some point we cannot go down forever...
429 2018-07-21 22:57:31 初めまして！リップルは推そうと考えてて、まだ持ってないんですwリップルのことまだまだ調べてるところなんですが、今の価格ってお手頃な感じですか？？もしよろしければ教えてください！！これからよろしくお願いします(ﾟ∀ﾟ)
430 2018-07-21 22:57:27 I’m very happy with my Tron.
431 2018-07-21 22:57:22 At the risk of being cryptomed #2 please stop. Rand has tons of followers, and he charges to interview so what. Let him capitalize on his business. That’s like getting mad at people for promoting glass blunts on insta. Who cares?
432 2018-07-21 22:57:11 Same, but I trust the team, they're the most professional in crypto
433 2018-07-21 22:57:02 いやいやいやいやいやいやいや私なんざ、取り分けもしないしLINEも触るし最低です〜(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)

ポジティブなお気遣い感謝します。
434 2018-07-21 22:56:42 Aaaaaaaah damn! I was really looking forward to that! It really would be the most interesting #Crypto debat ever! It would crush @rogerkver ‘s Flip out @BitcoinErrorLog or @RichardHeartWin live crying about bitcoins dip @IvanOnTech for sure!!

437 2018-07-21 22:56:35 EOS is dogshit I’m so many ways. Matrix does 10k tps and HPS does 10k+ lol. Only record EOS is breaking is the most overvalued centralized project in crypto.
438 2018-07-21 22:56:35 @The_TRON_Don
439 2018-07-21 22:56:32 @tradingroomapp I noticed your commentary re: there not being billions of real fiat invested in crypto but a castle in the sky illusion of money (which I agree with). Can you explain why crypto doesn’t completely empty out if it’s actual worth is possib. 80-90% less??
440 2018-07-21 22:56:11 個人的に幼稚や常識が足りないと感じるものばかりで、見てるだけで嫌な気持ちになるので。

まあそうしないとうさ晴らしできなかったり、心が不安定になってしまってるのだと思いますよ。
弱ってるときに正しい判断が常に下せる人ってなかなかいませんから。
やられた側はたまったものじゃないので。
441 2018-07-21 22:55:54 Fuck the fundamentals, Coinbase moon all that will come later when BTC figures out it's price.
442 2018-07-21 22:55:42 What are you talking about? This is one of the more solid projects out there....

447 2018-07-21 22:54:06 We are the most hated project in the entire crypto world 
448 2018-07-21 22:54:04 勝手ですが、私はその話を聞いてる時のさっきーさんの姿勢とか相槌とか、そういう部分が素敵だったから相手の方も楽しく話し続けられたのではないのかなと思いました。
449 2018-07-21 22:54:03 Node/hashing question:

When hashing files, does it matter which crypto algorithm u use?

sha1, md5, sha256 etc

Which is recommended? 
450 2018-07-21 22:54:00 If we want an alt season, then we need clueless people to buy the top. My investigation work has proved beyond reasonable doubt that we have LOADS of them still in crypto. Just search $XRP. The idiots are huge In numbers. Good times
451 2018-07-21 22:53:44 So you shouldn't be known for being yourself in a party with your friends?



Influencers on crypto are all these same scumbag bigots and they became big for a reason, 90% in this space are basically the same.

Being a woman here is considered abnormal.
452 2018-07-21 22:53:38 Where do they get this stuff?  It's been reverse mooning since its ath.  $xrp #crypto
453 2018-07-21 22:53:38 Indeed! Foolishness is mainstream news aka cnbc petty crypto tribalism etc... smoke n mirrors meant to distract but enough crumbs in open source code and talking points to find the right path through this crypto maze

456 2018-07-21 22:53:19 I think this is most likely
457 2018-07-21 22:53:08 ICO's will eventually extend outside the crypto market and give the general public access to a previously exclusive market.
458 2018-07-21 22:52:53 And who made you the judge?
459 2018-07-21 22:52:31 Great News   - #linda is one of the most  undervalued #crypto right now 
460 2018-07-21 22:52:00 Most of the people I meet say they are too poor to use crypto. How do we tell them they are not without sounding pretentious?
461 2018-07-21 22:51:37 Ever wonder why you only see others posting of gains in a bear market for the last 7 months? If you like to know how to pick your ICOs or How to trade in the crypto market. Leave a comment below. If I get more than 50 likes. I will host a two-hour event in Singapore, free.

463 2018-07-21 22:51:19 素敵ですね(*´꒳`*)
若い女の子に対してさっきーさんがそう感じたように、若い女の子もさっきーさんに何か素敵な部分を感じているのではと思います。
誰かに対して肯定的にいたらそれが相手にも伝わり互いにプラスに考えると私は思ってるのです。
464 2018-07-21 22:51:12 @auroralone
465 2018-07-21 22:51:09 Remember when Bitcoin crashed from $32 down to $5 and everyone said the crypto Hubble was over.
466 2018-07-21 22:51:04 Best beer out ther @DaytradeJeffrey cheers for #crypto
467 2018-07-21 22:50:31 I'll do my best. When ven gets at $2 she will probably follow me everwhere

リベンジポルノは失恋行動の最も虚しい行為ですね。笑
好きだった人を攻撃するのは、その人を好きだった頃の自分まで殺してしまうみたいでとても悲しい。振られちゃっても、過ごした時間は嘘にはならないのに。
470 2018-07-21 22:49:43 What will crypto look like in 5, 10, 25 years? Imagination is the only limit.
471 2018-07-21 22:49:42 Cool
472 2018-07-21 22:49:42 Hmm, I remember last year when the hardfork and then futures was announced, $BTC rallied like crazy and alts lost most of their satts value. I would just be careful here. I'm not convinced we've hit bottom for alts in their satts value. Basing this purely on what happened before
473 2018-07-21 22:49:40 Great to hear, crypto investors are like kids, you need to keep them busy with information.
474 2018-07-21 22:49:12 @NguyenValenci @Thoughtspools @ItsLifeDiarie @ferkonjica @BaddiesxWrld
475 2018-07-21 22:49:07 Important to distinguish current from prospective value.  Few are excited because of what crypto is in terms of the instant value offered today.  It’s all early stage.  We’re excited because of what the tech can do at scale.
476 2018-07-21 22:49:06 Sunday on bearish
477 2018-07-21 22:49:00 Get back in crypto now dude. Admit u were wrong we'll never go to 5k again and 1k lmfao 
478 2018-07-21 22:48:17 Lol. In the 90s i went to some schools that were fairly ghetto, fairly rough. When OG meant "Original Gangsta". Where calling yourself an og would get u put in the hospital or worse if u werent one. And all these millenial kids today playing online saying theyre the real OGs

500 2018-07-21 22:45:15 I don't like to discuss #politics because I'm respectful of most people's beliefs if they aren't harmful.

502 2018-07-21 22:44:35 You're not wrong; trash does tend to pump well in crypto. It's just funny that out of all of the coins out there you are buying a pornhub payment coin.

561 2018-07-21 22:34:14 There's 2 factions in crypto - the idealists and the traders/investors.  Privacy coins like Monero have intrinsic value to the first group, but it's the second group will end up driving the value (unless the coin is adopted/integrated by an influential company or government).

563 2018-07-21 22:34:01 Crypto has been blowing wistle on scammers for months now, why are you only now reacting, and to a NYT piece, and with open abstractions for suggested improvements! You will find a long list of suggestions if you go through your @ 's over the past years.
564 2018-07-21 22:34:00 Although use cases/user base could be dramatically different...
565 2018-07-21 22:33:23 Agree with Mike. How would someone new to Crypto even frame the question? Other than being opportunitistic, I think it why so many folks new to Crypto gravitated towards investing. It's the only aspect of the space that has a recognizable non-crypto comp.
566 2018-07-21 22:32:50 Everybody's holding their breath until Aug 10th. Whales will get insider info though and they'll move the market one way or the other in the week or two before. IMHO, SEC will likely push decision out for another 45 days. #Crypto

591 2018-07-21 22:27:18 The market cap of a currency has always been at least an order of magnitude larger than that of even the largest companies. Thus we should assume some multiplier. It would make a $100B Bitcoin not so daunting. Perhaps divide by ten? $btc #crypto
592 2018-07-21 22:27:15 Hello world of crypto and ECC, want to hear something ironic? Well the biggest corruption case is right in the center of the government, officials being paid to do the biding of whoever pays them and is not usually in the public’s best interest. Just think

601 2018-07-21 22:25:38 Deep learning is my game.

There's so much power to be gained, so much fresh material to learn every year, so much money being poured into deep learning research (~$4b/year in R&D), so much societal change, that I won't run out.

I respect crypto. I simply focus on AI personally.

632 2018-07-21 22:19:36 Why do people consistently talk about volatility in stocks or crypto as a sure way to lose money? Goes down, goes up, goes down, goes up. There's a pattern...

634 2018-07-21 22:19:00 What exactly do you mean by “lack of volume reading”? Do you mean volume is a lot more uniform with less volatility due to the liquidity? So it’s not used as much as an indicator as it is in crypto markets?

657 2018-07-21 22:13:17 What I like about the crypto market is that everyone realises that this is the future. The arguments now are just what are the better coins and are the price/date predictions.
658 2018-07-21 22:13:16 Indeed, there have been a lot of positive news recently in the direction of Bitcoin and crypto currency in general. If this is the case, then for #Buzar it will be a good push forward. After all, the best crypto assets will definitely be in demand and their price will grow.
659 2018-07-21 22:13:13 Out of all 5 to be added to Coinbase, I think $ZRX and $BAT have exponentially more room to run due to the small market cap alone

850 2018-07-21 21:40:21 Arthur Hayes, CEO of crypto trading platform BitMEX, has suggested Bitcoin’s current bull run may give way to a price point of $5,000 before heading to $50,000 in 2018, CNBCreports July 19.
851 2018-07-21 21:40:10 Bitcoin introduced the first crypto-currency, and the 1st transaction was an agreement to exchange 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 Pizzas.  Those would be million dollars’ pizzas by the current price of Bitcoin.  But once again, it was by agreement to exchange Bitcoin for Pizza. #tpesa

862 2018-07-21 21:38:39 I just found myself teaching somebody about #crypto.  I do this a lot when I'm out in new groups in the general public....(I know, super scary).  It felt great to be able to answer so many questions.  From the very basics of what a candle represents to the future of crypto.
863 2018-07-21 21:38:24 I do that at the private jet dealer ship.. fx? Crypto is so new school! 
864 2018-07-21 21:38:13 One of the hardest things is to actually look back at what you have written down, but once you do it’s so easy not to have that splif.
865 2018-07-21 21:38:04 Weekends are great! Less time with crypto and more time for everything else! :)
866 2018-07-21 21:37:55 Ik kon je niet antwoorden omdat je weer  eens tweets ging verwijderen en mij blokkeerde. 
Als je net zo trade als dat je op Twitter actief bent, zie ik het somber in. 
Einde discussie voor mij.
867 2018-07-21 21:37:52  hope you at least get the gist of my post.  A lot of reasons traders blow out public accounts.  You’re better than jumping on the Flood bandwagon to dog ITC.  Don’t get caught up in his daily bullshit, it will do nothing but bring you down to his clown level
868 2018-07-21 21:37:46 Yeah, their wives already don't know all their money is in crypto and then your marvelous breasts show up. Teachable moments in crypto twitter.

876 2018-07-21 21:36:30 Just kicked weed about 8 days ago. I suggest journaling it. Daily self reflection really helps, especially to look back at on the days that you struggle.

880 2018-07-21 21:35:57 It's a discussion with clown Michael which started in a thread where he posted your DM's. Meanwhile he deleted the OP.
881 2018-07-21 21:35:49 I meant TRX .  I had some that I forgot about lol
882 2018-07-21 21:35:10 Only last year started cannabis oil treatment with positive results. I don't know about preventing cancer but imagine if it can cure it can prevent. Lacks more scientific studies about this. So sorry for your lost @WhatBitcoinDid
883 2018-07-21 21:34:47 Well, more likely it would just lead to balanced trade from the US. Although people are certainly free to use crypto, it probably won't replace fiat money for the simple reason that the state isn't going to let you pay your taxes in crypto currency.
884 2018-07-21 21:34:47 Yeah that's on you not me
885 2018-07-21 21:34:33 I found a ton of free easy ways to earn free crypto on a daily basis
FIRST COMMENT BELOW
886 2018-07-21 21:34:20 I believe $DIG absolutely will be listed on #Binance in the coming weeks (or months). That being said ... the Tweet circulating today saying it is a done deal appears to be manufactured and fake | I see no mention of DIG anywhere at the Binance site | #crypto #altcoins #bitcoin
887 2018-07-21 21:34:19 Your hate is the reaction, a reaction to an imagined event.  It’s like you’re spreading FUD.

943 2018-07-21 21:23:44 When I first started in crypto I talked to anyone who would listen about it! Now I try to avoid conversations about it because people just think this is one big “ponzi” scheme! Everyones an expert on something they know nothing about!!

953 2018-07-21 21:22:58 with crypto currency we can now produce our own money 
954 2018-07-21 21:22:46 It’s very interesting bc 1.75% is nothing in crypto, but something if you own so much VET u create slippage buying and selling. So it is an incentive for large XNodes, not small ones.

958 2018-07-21 21:22:07 That’s absolutely not the definition of market making, sorry. Making the markets means continuously quoting both sides of the book on an instrument.

961 2018-07-21 21:21:44 Of course. $scroll has been about the investors and product since they started, that's why I wanted people to watch the Q&A! Too soon to give a target since It's not stabilised. $1+ seems a guarantee though

1) Do these devices _not_ use end-to-end crypto?!?
2) if it’s just a modem making a phone call, what’s to stop any old device making that call?
973 2018-07-21 21:19:38 Without some sort of disclosure, these "influencers" attempt to disguise their shilling as reviews and interviews. It's called being shady, not capitalism.
974 2018-07-21 21:19:31 he probably has no standing, but do you want to be the person who built your entire wallet/product whatever around the nchain technology and then have to fight it is court because you chose a different fork than CSW?

976 2018-07-21 21:19:25 In a Free market example - that is very true. If BCH were to fork and we created BCH1 and BCH2 then in a free market situation an IP can not be restricted from one or the other CSW is saying he gets to choose what fork his IP transfers to. this is why everyone is upset. Legally,

986 2018-07-21 21:17:32 This is one of the best lessons you can learn in crypto:

You do not have to make all of the money. You will never catch every opportunity. If you make peace with that it'll help cure your fomo. Focus the setups you do catch and always have an exit plan.

1003 2018-07-21 21:15:07 Starting to believe this may have been a bull-trap orchestrated by big players i.e. coinbase and even blackrock to pump their bags then retracting statements. Lets be serious- there is absolutely NO doubt that blackrock is exploring and probably actively involved in crypto.

1016 2018-07-21 21:13:43 Unless a crypto project is totally dead (no community, no developments) then exchanges should not be delisting coins/tokens that required a fee to be listed. This is a bad practice that needs to stop. That is theft of services by the exchange.
1017 2018-07-21 21:13:24 You're doing something right. I have some VIA in a Coinomi wallet and it's the only crypto I keep with me on the phone. Something just seems right about it as my "liquid" stash.

1020 2018-07-21 21:13:10 I've followed you since my entering in crypto space.  I really like your "simple" method of "listen to the chart telling its story". Your method seems simple, yet it's difficult to figure out, let alone to master.  I've learned only few points, here & there via your posts. Thanks
1021 2018-07-21 21:13:02 EW is such a daunting TA style to take on . So many rules and guidelines that must be met that people get lost in the sauce and would rather find it another way .
EW is by far the greatest thing when used correctly.

1124 2018-07-21 20:58:25 I was arguing that holding creates value. Perhaps this argument is more meaningful from the perspective of an emerging, possible currency. If no one wants it -> 0.

I don't claim that Bitcoin (or any other crypto) is today a useful substitute for currencies' all functions.

1134 2018-07-21 20:56:47 See my response to another tweet. I don’t have strong feelings either way about crypto, but obviously there’s problems in current stack
1135 2018-07-21 20:56:33 Everyone bailing on crypto twitter is a totally pussy. My guess is they've used up their 50k accounts basically and now it's time to work hard on their lower tier accounts get them up to respectable shill level. I see it constantly 8-10 accounts from April 2018 clearly related.

1143 2018-07-21 20:55:03 "Marc Lasry, manager of a $9.6 billion asset management firm said that he has personally invested 1% of his $1.7 billion net worth into crypto and thinks that Bitcoin can reach in $40,000 in three to five years."

I personally believe we will reach that this year.
1144 2018-07-21 20:54:52 I've been asked that a lot.  I haven't used crypto kitties, but from what I've seen it looks like you're just purchasing/breading your kitties.

If you choose to ignore all that knowledge and just fomo buy whatever coin someone tweets about on here, this won’t work out well for you

2) I'm so grateful I got to go through another bear market to prepare me for the next big run.

1220 2018-07-21 20:38:27 My opinion on this is that it will not be immediate, however, the user base for SBI is truly enormous, and represents a completely different demographic than current crypto traders are comprised of.

1237 2018-07-21 20:34:44 Cool story, bro
1238 2018-07-21 20:34:21 That's why me and my cousin are starting a crypto consulting/education company and going to have very low fees. The more people in crypto the stronger it is.
1239 2018-07-21 20:34:13 Used to smoke a pack a day. I read an once that half of the thrill of smoking is seeing the smoke roll out of your mouth and that a study found those who smoked with eyes closed, depriving them of the euphoria of seeing the smoke when they'd exhale, quit quicker. Try it!
1240 2018-07-21 20:34:12 To all the Crypto doubters, there's a guy out there that sold his 600 #Bitcoin stash bcuz the price dropped from $14 to $8... That guy is a complete idiot, but you don't have to be. #Hodlgang
1241 2018-07-21 20:34:02 Hang on to that dream buddy. Always remember you are holding central bank money when you hold #xrp. Its no ordinary crypto. Its superior to others together with all its functions and utility products..
1242 2018-07-21 20:33:43 If you are a first-time crypto investor I would recommend putting some funds in to get used to the process and get in the game no matter what. But - we are in the midst of a surge so it might not be a bad idea to wait for a dip to buy imo...

1249 2018-07-21 20:32:49 There are real projects that haven’t even come on Coinmarketcap yet or are deeply undervalued like Aragon and many others. These will rise to the top eventually and many others will die. I think the crypto mcap will still be distributed amongst 100-200 diff protocols

1262 2018-07-21 20:31:41 Answer to this issue is so simple, just write #sponsored. Transparency lead to trust. Maybe Rand simply doesn't care about ethic or good manners on TW, that is also his right. He post interesting content and has lots of good alt s calls shared publicly. This is CT. DYOR as usual.
1263 2018-07-21 20:31:24 Happy you enjoyed this latest edition Zerpenator!  Listening to the panel testimony was eye-opening.  I think the US would definitely benefit from fostering innovation in blockchain technology as the hearings revealed.

1265 2018-07-21 20:31:20 It's a fast-acting ponzi scheme. The former earn the money the latter lose. It's a dark way to make money, very dark.
1266 2018-07-21 20:31:18 Tips on mastery of the tool?
1267 2018-07-21 20:31:15 Who cares.  Get a life shill exposer
Rand makes money on taking positions on his TA calls too, should we be upset he doesn’t tell us how much
1268 2018-07-21 20:31:13 ...It would have a 296,357,969,500 market cap.
1269 2018-07-21 20:31:07 They had issues with the old token SWT and interoperatability. I believe they solved the issue and the other is spreading FUD.
1270 2018-07-21 20:31:00 Smh...perhaps it’s the unmanipulatability of crypto that is the worry.  Indeed, interesting times to live in!
1271 2018-07-21 20:30:59 There’s a big difference between tobacco and stimulants tho
1272 2018-07-21 20:30:57 Yup.

1387 2018-07-21 20:11:08 Possible not probable! I expect $TRX to hit $3 this year so $XLM could reach $5 if it @coinbase lists it. Also expect $ICX to reach $25 by EOY. #crypto

1390 2018-07-21 20:10:36 @BobSummerwill has told me a bit about you. Lots of the women interested in crypto, have a lot of things in common with each other, I am finding. And more typically “male” interests. There are many INTPs in Ethereum too, I find. I can spot them easily.
1391 2018-07-21 20:10:33 f00k em man. Call out people start crypto twitter bash, it's unhealthy to keep things bottled up ^^
1392 2018-07-21 20:10:14 All tiers are the same, it just means that it cost me a little less money than the tier 3 tickets they are selling right now (at the beginning they sold tier 1 tickets and they were the cheapest)
1393 2018-07-21 20:10:14 Getting paid for his time and reach. Nothing scandalous about that
1394 2018-07-21 20:10:12 Problem with most investors in crypto assets is the lack of timing and patience that can make you a fortune. 

Not the type the stupid magazine labels talk about, but with your own money!

my follower account reflects the fact that I don't give a f***. Should be banging near a hundred K like the other crypto guys. But standing up for what I believe is morally correct is more important
1429 2018-07-21 20:05:56 De toute façon pour te dire vrai toutes les crypto doivent de soutenir pour que l'adoption se fasse. Donc je ne suis pas contre le #BTC mais je préfère le #XRP... les deux vont continuer très certainement...

1445 2018-07-21 20:03:38 Yep. They broke through a world of regulatory capture that hurt customers. As with anything like this, regulations will reset to a new normal.

1456 2018-07-21 20:02:04 When they go down, Alts run faster, and when they go up, Alts go up faster! If BTC goes up alone and other coins stay at the same prices, that is extremely nice and bullish for all crypto! BTC is the less risky bet in crypto, new people/institutions buying for the first time

1531 2018-07-21 19:51:20 This is incorrect. I used to take whey protein supplements and eat well and yes I gained. I stopped for health reasons so lost a lot and gained fat but now back on and I'm not taking protein and doing less but I've gained more in less time. I'm not even eating any different.

1539 2018-07-21 19:50:38 Double tops are a noob's favorite. While you keep shorting, CO accumulates. And paints a bull flag as a result. Smart traders buy near the EMA, you sell. You get trapped. We profit.
1540 2018-07-21 19:50:31 I think it is shameful that white players don't support this protest against police brutality. Don't they want to be role models for a better America too? One where the slaughter of unarmed Americans by police does not happen with total impunity?

$BNB like all crypto is developing

As an aside; I think 2018 will be a great trading year for crypto with huge swings leading into a 2019 parabolic rise and reset.

1563 2018-07-21 19:46:44 1/ Funny thing about leverage. Thought I would be handicapped on Kraken with only 5x leverage. After watching @CryptoCred videos, leverage is just a tool to achieve a position size for a given risk level.

1684 2018-07-21 19:27:12 The worst part of trading is knowing when to take profits. You sell too early, the coin runs and you miss out. You sell too late and your coin drops and everything is lost. This is the risk you take when you enter speculative assets. #cryptonews #crypto #altcoins
1685 2018-07-21 19:27:12 That's how most feel in a bull market.

1702 2018-07-21 19:24:55 These are the same basic questions you asked in the last interview you did. It appears as if you aren't researching the projects that you bring to the public's attention.

1727 2018-07-21 19:21:56 There is no ownership of ideas. The person thinking he has the right to control other people's behavior based on what he once thought or said is the entitled one.
nChain decides what they're working on, but they have no right to control what @deadalnix is working on.

1779 2018-07-21 19:15:38 probably the fact the devs that belong to nchain that I follow do not parrot thew CSW mantra but actually discuss cool shit? Even @JimmyWinMedia even though he parrots craig he has a more Public relations spin to him and has respect for the company and #bitcoincash that shows.

1821 2018-07-21 19:09:46 even u forgot. now reply on crypto machis.

1829 2018-07-21 19:08:22 Bitcoin looking great. Think we're getting the beginning of wave 5 of 3 today.
1830 2018-07-21 19:08:15 Really? Think about the opportunity to buy it again at that level. You and I know that this will rocket again, so why not buy more at that level again? If you could buy BTC @ $500 how much would you buy?
1831 2018-07-21 19:08:13 @crypto_rand probably one of the most legit people giving info away. People always want to point a finger for their own problems instead of excepting responsibility of being an idiot

1833 2018-07-21 19:08:00 Okay thanks
1834 2018-07-21 19:07:44 Like you said, a patent troll does not need to create, they don't need to practice their patents by building things out of them. But they might, and still be trolls according to 

"enforce patent rights [...] far beyond the patent's actual value or contribution to the prior art"
1835 2018-07-21 19:07:39 
1836 2018-07-21 19:07:35 neither do you.
1837 2018-07-21 19:07:24 This Nick, Tim, and Geoff are nothing but SPIN.   They are keen on marketing bullshit in order to drive up the Divi price but that's all I see.  Any intelligent person looking under the covers can clearly see there is not 'much there, there'.

1843 2018-07-21 19:06:04 Totally agree that consistently high volume is meaningful. The original post seemed to imply a bullish continuation, but as you clarified here, volume itself does not necessarily imply a direction. The original post might have been confusing to some.

1845 2018-07-21 19:05:53 ce que dit charlie lee   sur les crypto monnaie, où selon lui il faut investir en priorité dans le bitcoin au lieu des plus petite crypto je pense que c’est une erreur de pensée comme sa. car qui dit petite crypto dit plus de quantités à l’achat et plus de potentiel.
1846 2018-07-21 19:05:42 Theres a lot of hate in the crypto community for $xrp but ultimately it will see a great deal of growthand hit new ATH IMHO

1849 2018-07-21 19:05:34 I would make a distinction between what I consider pure patent trolling and possibility that nChain might really practice their patents (regardless of how valid we may consider them) and use them to control future forks of BCH.
1850 2018-07-21 19:05:20 Some people define sexism, racism, etc as simply a prejudiced view, which anyone can have. But those -isms are increasingly being defined as one-directional because it’s the systemic aspect of them that really matters. Some people are not targets of that systemic bias.

1965 2018-07-21 18:47:51 Or to dump your bags on noobs at ATHs who listen to your interviews etc preaching that crypto is going much further etc. I wonder how many small people got REKT after listening to you. You are in it for the money honey, which is fair enough.

1978 2018-07-21 18:45:45 Smoke you know how real life works right? Rolling stone magazine does stories that they made money from because they have a major outlet and if you want good PR it costs money, are they going to come out and say they got paid for an article each time? Be realistic

1992 2018-07-21 18:42:27 We are working on a chrome extension that removes crypto bots built on top of our bot detection API @AstroscreenHQ

1993 2018-07-21 18:42:14 He’s accusing the political class of hypocrisy (which is justified). It’s not “treason” to take some (even much) of the blame for deteriorating US-Russia relations. 

And saying THAT hardly makes you a Trumpist or even a “crypto-Trumpist.”
1994 2018-07-21 18:42:10 You're so full of crap, just like that bag of crap #XRP $XRP ...

You have no idea what you're talking about...please educate yourself. 

Banks would never use the actual crypto (#xrp) - they would just technically be using the blockchain applications to settle payments.
1995 2018-07-21 18:42:07 Entire #crypto market is in this weird place. People sold alts to fomo into $BTC. Alts haven't rebounded yet. Some alts about to go on second big runs (you know which ones). Only constant is the beatdown of highcaps (obv). This stretch to August 10th is gonna be something.

2100 2018-07-21 18:24:00 Maybe. But i counted 3 drops which means 1 more and we have trend reversal.

2115 2018-07-21 18:21:55 yeah. of course you are right. unfortunately most people don't understand the concepts of blockchain, crypto and privacy so they just buy shit from idiot consultants and burn a lot of cash doing it. ;)
2116 2018-07-21 18:21:50 Yup. Then they will realize and laugh about it.
2117 2018-07-21 18:21:39 False dichotomy. The reason #Siacoin uses a #blockchain independent of #bitcoin is b/c they have a service they intend to render (decentralized #cloud storage). Reliance on #BTC's algorithm would undermine the entire mission of @SiaTechHQ altogether. #cryptocurrency #Crypto

2120 2018-07-21 18:21:23 @SatoshiLite after thinking about the crypto space for months and months, I decided that I don't like your litecoin is silver to bitcoin's gold. Bitcoin is my savings account and litecoin is my checking account. Do you agree that's better?
2121 2018-07-21 18:21:06 The horizontal lines mean areas of interest. XDDD hahah u didn't ask how u generated them or whatever. XD
2122 2018-07-21 18:20:34 It’s one thing being paid to co-sign, promote, or shill a crypto, it’s different than getting paid to allow someone else to express their ideas to your audience.

2129 2018-07-21 18:19:16 None of you came at McAfee when he was doing his paid shills, now you want to come at @crypto_rand for just giving interviews with projects?

2131 2018-07-21 18:19:12 Plus those people are weird and I would rather them follow someone else. I have always said, the less followers I have tells me this crypto craze is not over yet. Want the masses following people who don't know what they are doing when it comes to trading. That is to my advantage

2168 2018-07-21 18:11:06 I think a professional ad campaign for crypto that aren’t asking you to invest in mining would do wonders for the industry. Educating people is the most important thing.
2169 2018-07-21 18:11:01 There are many other opportunities (such as content industry micropayments), but those are merely a result of slowness of status quo industries, they don't employ crypto's fundamental value. It'll be nice to invade them nonetheless.

2171 2018-07-21 18:10:27 Two important factor in trading and investing in Crypto: TIME and PRICE

- The time you enter a trade or exit is very important.

- The price at which you bought and sold is equally important.

2216 2018-07-21 18:03:49 I guess crypto should come with a label like cigarettes for you? 
2217 2018-07-21 18:03:46 @CoinbaseSupport My case has been open for over a month. I have a $0 balance & cannot withdraw funds or transfer to another account. My crypto is locked for no reason. I was told there is a bug in the system. Why is this taking a month?  You cannot hold on to my funds w/o reason
2218 2018-07-21 18:03:40 I will leave Bank of America Merrill Lynch soon to then start my journey in the world of blockchain technologies and crypto markets. I am preparing to join @tendermint_team, and can't wait to begin contributing to @cosmos
2219 2018-07-21 18:03:27 I see the burn as just the simplest way to create more demand based on decreased supply. One of the oldest marketing tricks in the world I believe. It has been applied to countless merch lines and crypto tokens/coin supplies alike.

2224 2018-07-21 18:02:53 One day in our lifetime we will live in a cashless society...

We will pay for everything...

Food, car parking, commodities, online goods, insurance, holidays, cars, real estate...

With tokens.

It will be a tokenized world.

People just don’t know it yet.

Long live Crypto

2254 2018-07-21 17:58:08 #Facebook changes its timeline a little, unblocks Crypto Exchange ads! The grapevine says that they are coming out with a crypto of their own, maybe that changed their mind. Nonetheless, let’s trade away!

2293 2018-07-21 17:52:05 Some cool benefits of vaping:

Not producing trash / stockpiling nasty used cigs;

No bad smell in ur clothes / body / mouth;

Being able to smoke inside places as it has a good smell (although it's good to be careful with this part as it could easily lead to vape addiction)
2294 2018-07-21 17:51:21 Vin, where’s your supporting July quote for CSW claiming they would fork BCH?  What you’ve included says no such thing.

2328 2018-07-21 17:45:59 Try getting your hands on Desmoxan. Me and at least 2 others in my family used it to quit. After trying everything this worked for us like a charm. Easiest withdrawal ever from nicotine. Now nicotine free for 3.5 years . And no, I dont work for em, just an ex addict

2352 2018-07-21 17:41:52 It is very uncommon in many fields to accept paid interviews.

2359 2018-07-21 17:40:58 He blocked me months ago just for liking someone else's reply... smh...

This might also explain why he posts so many different charts everyday.... I was like, why would anybody do TA on that many shitcoins on a daily basis...
2360 2018-07-21 17:40:57 Rand posts charts after they've pumped but he posts the chart as it looked before it pumped. He tries to induce as much FOMO as possible. I asked him politely why he does it and I was blocked. Thin skin usually pairs well with guilt.
2361 2018-07-21 17:40:53 I commented an observation on a coin obviously pumping because of his call... He blocked me 1 minute later

The only outlets that pay for interviews are garbage publications like The National Enquirer and Entertainment Tonight. It isn't a normal practice, it isn't what someone who wants trust does, and no disclosure? lol

Vaping works, but my advice is dont trying to be a hero right away. I saw that you're working out more. That will help.

2) Start with high nicotine. The first time I tried to quit with vaping, I used too low of a nicotine content in the juice.
3) Replace certain times you would normally smoke with vape. One of the first steps I did was stopped smoking in my car and vaped instead.

2413 2018-07-21 17:36:11 I quit using a vape. I was not successful at first. Here are a few tips.
1) Try usinging the vape while you're still smoking. The reason for this is you want to make sure you have found the right hardware/device for long term use and have a back up plan if it fails.

2469 2018-07-21 17:29:59 Let’s study a bit on crypto & let see how it works...

2540 2018-07-21 17:18:50 Just a quick reminder to those that are trading OCC - its safest to keep your coins and tokens in a wallet that you hold the private key/JSON/seed phrase too.

2751 2018-07-21 16:46:22 @realDonaldTrump is notoriously tech-illiterate. He doesn't even use email. He consistently refers to "servers" with no apparent grasp of what they are.

Transferring 5-15 BTC is much faster than waiting on some dumb bank to clear $35,000-$100,000 transactions.
2820 2018-07-21 16:37:23 Don’t know what is the thing here but I agree with that.
2821 2018-07-21 16:36:38 So I’ve come up with the solution for governments concerned about their #fiat compared to #crypto. Example: @realDonaldTrump make $BTC a legal tender and tie $USD to an equivalent value of $BTC similar to how it used to be tied to gold. $100,000 = 1 $BTC. Problem solved. Done 
2822 2018-07-21 16:36:20 100%, I had friends who sold classes on elliot wave/trading.

2875 2018-07-21 16:28:52 This is soo true and he's not shilling on here he's offering a medium by doing interviews. This Shillexed thing is going overboard now.
2876 2018-07-21 16:28:39 And in other news... Water is wet, and my grandma shouldn't be allowed to drive.
2877 2018-07-21 16:28:24 A great project that allows you to earn free currency, which can soon become one of the leading crypto currencies in the world @PaymiumFr @paymium #Paymium
2878 2018-07-21 16:28:13 Well i know for a fact rand charges 1 btc for an interview + Twitter share and he doesnt hide It. Just dm him asking for an interview and you'll see.
2879 2018-07-21 16:28:08 When was everyone being nice in crypto 
2880 2018-07-21 16:27:47 He’s also just not smart at all
2881 2018-07-21 16:27:32 Telegram is by far the worst crypto space
2882 2018-07-21 16:27:32 Good luck I would say 
2883 2018-07-21 16:27:22 Not sure if serious? Weekly/Daily look awful
2884 2018-07-21 16:27:07 Well that didn’t add much substance besides your opinion of rand lol.  I’m not condemning or defending him, I’m simply asking how do we verify this is real?
2885 2018-07-21 16:26:59 I use Crypto Twitter as a data dump for my mind.

Should anything happen to me my ideas will live on in 24,600 of my followers.

In other words, I'm immortalizing myself through decentralization.

Like Satoshi.
2886 2018-07-21 16:26:51 Why don’t you create an account that exposes “POSITIVE” things crypto people do.....? @cryptorand13 has done many many good deeds.

But just like normal news media...positive stuff isn’t as interesting is it....
2887 2018-07-21 16:26:50 Remember when your down $1000 in Crypto someone else is down $100000 in the same hour.
2888 2018-07-21 16:26:34 Everyone here is a bit curious to see what happens. That’s what makes it interesting
2889 2018-07-21 16:26:32 the question is, can this be done in a crypto-anarchistic way (ie. no legal name/jurisdiction transfer. It's nice, but if it can't preserve privacy, no go for some of us :(

2893 2018-07-21 16:26:07 He blocks everyone even remotely questioning him, and by association, prob to further illusion among followers no one questions him.
2894 2018-07-21 16:26:06 Damn.. I had a similar hook I'd sing to myself but looks like he beat to making it a song!
2895 2018-07-21 16:26:01 Some of your statements were based on misinformation according to my own research, and I consider myself very thorough.   I disagree with the, undelying theme that crypto is going to kill the bank so don't support xrp.
2896 2018-07-21 16:25:53 And what if scammers paid for the interview? Will he ask them hard questions? I think not

2917 2018-07-21 16:22:50 It is not just a 'paid interview' but a 'paid undisclosed shill' and you need to disclose it. Any promotion of any financial instruments need to be disclosed. It's not just a normal interview of any successful person. He does interview of ICO founders which is a shill in disguise

2927 2018-07-21 16:21:37 You should read his reply again. His exact reasons for buying ETC is that it is immutable, verifiable & censorship resistant.
I don't mind ETH doing it's experiment but it can not claim these principles any more. In the long crypto game, these matter & make the difference.
2928 2018-07-21 16:21:26 Wait until they find out that crypto mining is massive NSA & GCHQ scam. The spooks hijacked a famous pyramid scheme on cusp of failure & are now paying buttons for massive distributed processing power.
2929 2018-07-21 16:21:24 You think most interviews are paid? Or is this just in cryptocurrency? Honest questions.
2930 2018-07-21 16:21:19 Do you really think he writes those posts for free? Naive.
That doesnt mean its bad. He is doing his business.

2953 2018-07-21 16:18:07 This is great news despite that 'stable'coin is a terribly misleading name, it should be 'pegged'coin. It will bring fiat into crypto a lot easier by separating the fiat onramps from the exchanges. You may be able to buy digitized fiat at your bank soon enough if the feds jump in

2958 2018-07-21 16:17:36 Agree in general but "over rated" is a bit subjective. 

Bottom line is we know it's going on but we play anyway...

Or a player doesn't know until they feel taken advantage of. In that case I'm sorry but now you know.

2976 2018-07-21 16:14:38 Sure, but It’s just a thin line for me. Publishing an interview and charging for access to his audience doesn’t seem so bad to me. I’m sure 90% of his followers didn’t read it in full or don’t understand it anyway. His tweet about Hashnet seemed pretty neutral to me
2977 2018-07-21 16:14:33 Fan of the idea behind shillexed, to exposed paid shills, advice to buy tops-but nobody gives a shit that Rand charges people for interviews

3030 2018-07-21 16:09:14 Remember:

The government needs crypto to transfer value from a dying fiat.

They can act like they are in control and doing crypto a favor but it's all a show ladies & gentleman. 

Truth is they need Crypto way more than crypto needs them!!

“It depends”
3043 2018-07-21 16:07:37 We could cite issues with any crypto "currency" "asset", however you would want to term them, for eternity.  Some people will believe in one, and others will not.  Motivators also differ, some are emotional, some are logical. In this, I believe logic is a better bet.
3044 2018-07-21 16:07:31 Of course he does that. Every fucking crypto account that does interview for idiot tokens are paid to do that. Like @IvanOnTech etc etc

3067 2018-07-21 16:05:08 At the Austin Bitcoin meetup, folks will request certain topics they want to learn about and then break off into small groups with an expert to learn more.

3072 2018-07-21 16:04:26 I already had such little respect for Rand. Everything he does is for his own benefit.
3073 2018-07-21 16:04:01 I'd like it to be a sandbox for crypto-collectivists.

that all the members of the earth may feel the need to validate all the tx, just as all americans took arms for liberty (they did not, not possible, dont tell monero, lol)
3074 2018-07-21 16:03:54 The point he's trying to make is that Rand charges for the interviews and doesn't disclose it. It's an indirect way of shilling.

3110 2018-07-21 16:00:40 Totally!   IMHO The biggest problem with Crypto conferences today is low signal to noise ratio.  This is in part because lots of promoters taking advantage of the fervor.  An “open source” conference where experts are not paid could be solution.

3138 2018-07-21 15:58:42 Ah, dude. I just read his HashNet interview he published a couple of days ago and didn’t see any shilling.  This proves he charges for interviews, not for shills. Not saying he doesn’t, but this doesn’t prove much.
3139 2018-07-21 15:58:29 Yeah. Stop trying to make a storm in a teacup

3144 2018-07-21 15:58:17 Why you say that? Any data? Any reasoning?

Later you’ll want to sell some crypto currency or speak about that, but sincerely, you just seem a sad populist and hater.
3145 2018-07-21 15:58:16 Now THIS is getting spicy
3146 2018-07-21 15:58:15 That's how every paid group in the space works though.

The leader buys -> tells his paid group -> tells Twitter.
Join any paid group and you'll see this.
That's a problem with paid groups in general.

3176 2018-07-21 15:55:45 1/3 But even those assessments are often way outdated. Very good for developed countries, average for everyone else. Lots of countries only put in place FIUs circa 2013 and KYC/DD circa 2016/17. And crypto for most of these places? Last thing to worry about.

3178 2018-07-21 15:55:09 Hey Crypto Days(@days_crypto), thank you for following me
3179 2018-07-21 15:55:08 Think anonymous sources always dicey, prob especially so in crypto space. That said, think the question is when, not if, we’ll see a bitcoin ETF.
3180 2018-07-21 15:55:02 Yes no need to make a drama of this. 
He is offering exposure to projects.
Pretty different from shilling with a tweet imo.
3181 2018-07-21 15:54:57 Bear markets are needed, without them we wouldn’t have Bull markets 

Did you make the most of it? 

Would you do anything differently next time?

3182 2018-07-21 15:54:47 That‘s perfectly fine but it would be ethical to point out which articles he got paid for.Just another sign of just how unmature this space is.

3184 2018-07-21 15:54:33 Great times! Nice meeting you Jose. Definitely worth the trip
3185 2018-07-21 15:54:33 One use I have for TA (I don’t do it, but there are MANY out there who do great work) that I have is to find entry points for my long term investments

I always cost average into #crypto bags on a schedule, but my initial entry point may delay a coin may drop further
3186 2018-07-21 15:54:31 For starters, Ripple owns less than 60% of the XRP.  Second, a crypto does not need to be 'mined' to be considered a digital currency. Bitcoin maxamilists don't get to create the crypto rules! XRP were given out to people for free at the start (through the World Community Grid!)
3187 2018-07-21 15:54:21 My old man once saw a guy with the plate "RDR PRF" (Rader Proof, natch) A) pass him FAR too quickly, and B) get pulled over not long after.

3209 2018-07-21 15:52:37 But he is not transparent that the interview is paid for. I used to think at first that he has a sincere interest in the coin. But in reality, he doesn't care about them.

I only post altcoin charts of coins I've already bought.
I'm not stupid, I'm not gonna ruin my entries.
Does that mean I'm pump and dumping?

I've only ever see rand post right before possible alt rallys.

3236 2018-07-21 15:49:48 However I must say doing a paid interview as long as it's the truth what is wrong with that? That's not scamming anyone or dumping on followers. You need to have better case than this screenshot .
3237 2018-07-21 15:49:39 I think the bright line is at disclosure. Paid and disclosed? Great. Paid and undisclosed? Problem.
3238 2018-07-21 15:49:37 Come on dude, most of us are quite aware Rand does paid promotion to some extent, even if it's not outright "Buy this ICO now, its amazing"
3239 2018-07-21 15:49:37 Very true but I consider this part of strategy development (backtesting, building models/algos) whereas portfolio construction is a separate process where you optimise for volatility / return targets at the portfolio level. Ultimately crypto investing requires HF and VC skills
3240 2018-07-21 15:49:37 Multi year Hodler looking for advice on researching alts and eventually trying my hand at buying/selling. I hear, and agree with, “DYOR” but as a crypto trading virgin some insight on how to research and where would be greatly appreciated.
3241 2018-07-21 15:49:25 Hey @CryptoCred why don't you just ask Rand if it's true. I'm sure he wouldn't lie to his pal.

3355 2018-07-21 15:35:01 No, my questions really:

1. is this a new thing or did I just miss out on such followers in the past (they don't seem like real sex worker accounts)?
2. potential criminality behind this (e.g. setup to rob / extort)?
3. a new threat targeting crypto accounts after ETH etc scams?
3356 2018-07-21 15:34:48 For most FIs/financial services there is pretty much agreement AML rules apply (even though rules may vary). Not there yet with crypto. In many places there are no AML requirements for exchanges. In US, we’ve had them since 2013. Treated like MSBs. That’s divergence I meant.

3367 2018-07-21 15:32:50 How many crypto scammers were stopped when a “fiat off-ramp” kyc’ed them? More people are positively affected by KYC, than negatively. Plus, if kyc is holding up unbanked, maybe they should get their country to provide identification that meets requirements?
