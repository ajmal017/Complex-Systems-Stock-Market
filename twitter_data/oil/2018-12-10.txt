1 2018-12-10 23:59:39 My first car was a '65 Corvair Monza, paid $350 for it in '68. Filled it up with gas for $3 about once a month and a quart of oil every week. 
2 2018-12-10 23:59:29 Crude oil price in international market is on rise still government has controlled it by cutting taxes. Arabio ka choose jaoo free me tel milega.

At 1 time oil and coal weren't readily available, at least not on the scale it is today, people didn't automatically accept those energy solutions either, advancements in tech made it accessible.
4 2018-12-10 23:59:13 Is a $250 oil change the norm?

10 2018-12-10 23:58:39 @byterryjones until the Oilers figure out an affordable pricing model that allows kids to be at the game, it will always be quiet. When I go to Oil Kings games, I’m always impressed with the atmosphere and it is 1/3 or less people, but tons of kids.
11 2018-12-10 23:58:36 You understand economics. Great. So you will understand that Canada has been selling Canadian Oil to the US around the 20$ mark and the US is flipping it to overseas markets at 60-70$. What do you think of those economics?
12 2018-12-10 23:58:34 Agree 100%. Oven roasted broccoli with olive oil and salt. Picky 3 y/o eats all broccoli & tells me macaroni & chicken nuggets are yucky
13 2018-12-10 23:58:19 avocado oil is nice
14 2018-12-10 23:58:09 Apparently spraying the tree with orange oil helps.
15 2018-12-10 23:57:55 Coconut oil is amazing lube. I add a touch of baby oil if I'm really going to get into it. Something about the imagery of you rubbing one out with coconut oil makes my eyes pop
16 2018-12-10 23:57:55 We might survive climate change but our FOOD PLANTS can't & our AGRICULTURE is totally dependent upon OIL, plus, 7.6 BILLION humans are not sustainable no matter what we do now. We will collapse & it won't be "green".
17 2018-12-10 23:57:53 I was not responding to a point about “executives,” David. Texas has a lot of oil companies. Lots of their employees are going to want to donate to Beto. He should be held accountable if he took $ from executives if he said he wouldn’t. Otherwise, meh 
18 2018-12-10 23:57:48 Always blows my mind how olive oil is way more expensive than crude oil. I mean one is made from olives and helps you make your favorite dish and the other from decayed dinosaurs and sends you down the highway at 70 mph

38 2018-12-10 23:57:30 Dammm, they really trying to do @tydollasign #ATL trying to give him 15yrs for having a little bit of Cocaine, THC Oil and less than an Ounce of Marijuana?? They charging him with 2 Felonies..That's crazy! Y'all trying move to Atlanta..y'all better be sure you know the law.
39 2018-12-10 23:57:24 Wow, a whole world is opening up to me. Better than olive oil you think?
40 2018-12-10 23:57:19 Sir, earlier same statement was materialized by many of star economists when RR Rajan decided to vacate the post with GDP of 4.6 & 1 million  balance payment of oil cos of Iran. 
Anyway sir, criticism is welcome.
41 2018-12-10 23:57:16 black seed oil
42 2018-12-10 23:57:07 In case anyone didn't know, cooking spray is literally oil in a can. Don't have Pam? Grab the olive oil and a napkin/paper towel.
43 2018-12-10 23:56:56 Finally got my la’ baby an oil change
44 2018-12-10 23:56:50 The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
45 2018-12-10 23:56:44 I just ordered CBD oil to help with my dog’s seizures.  Anyone have any experience using CBD oil for pets?
46 2018-12-10 23:56:40 Was much better in the 70's. They changed from an old cork gasket to a  rubber seal. I recall most cars in the 70's were getting old with 70,000 miles because they leaked oil so badly.
47 2018-12-10 23:56:36 Damn  actually, my mom found an oil that is supposed to help hair grow and you can apply it to your lashes too so if it really does work, I can share it with you so that you don’t have to worry about falsies
48 2018-12-10 23:56:28 And then the president asks for more oil production.
49 2018-12-10 23:56:27 Come see me I'll wash your feet then rub them down wit oil
50 2018-12-10 23:56:16 Looking to add something idfferent to your holiday meal
Had this last night
beet caprese
heirloom beets, local burrata, avocado, basil, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, 12 year balsamic

It was amazing and doable at home
51 2018-12-10 23:56:16 Sad to know that those Venezuelan individuals are the second largest users of tax heavens in the world (pg. 17) Public funds robbed from state own oil company. They could use BTC to keep those funds that belongs to a whole nation . A side effect of privacy...
52 2018-12-10 23:56:13 (I stand pouring a bottle of dawn dishsoap all over alfonse) I cannot BELIEVE someone was so irresponsible as to have dumped all that motor oil in the lake like that dont they know how sensitive the ducks are.
53 2018-12-10 23:56:08 I went to get an oil change and the guy made me cry he was so rude
54 2018-12-10 23:56:04 I was slathering coconut oil on my dog’s belly and it was highly reminiscent of prepping a Butterball turkey 
55 2018-12-10 23:56:01 Anybody use CBD oil? DM me. I gotta question about it
56 2018-12-10 23:55:58 Takes me back to Monty Python's Meaning of Life and John Cleese complaining about the boys putting linseed oil on the school cormorant.
57 2018-12-10 23:55:53 Can’t say enough about the @CurateTapasBar cookbook. Two ingredients it added to my kitchen: sherry vinegar, and blended oil. Give them your money, reap the tastiness.
58 2018-12-10 23:55:50 We all wish that we could, Quebec keeps beating the horse that is pulling them out of the ditch. It’s a very entitled attitude, they look down on us and our dirty oil business, high on the horse while they flush their toilets straight into the St. Lawrence, hypocrites!
59 2018-12-10 23:55:46 When I release dis ya oil out a my back u see
60 2018-12-10 23:55:46 Three pots, oil, cheese, chocolate
61 2018-12-10 23:55:41 If y’all don’t shut up about vaginas I’m calling Santa and cancelling Christmas and im telling everyone to soak their latkes in cold oil too
62 2018-12-10 23:55:39 Cool, snap a picture when you get your drink from her.
63 2018-12-10 23:55:22 Maybe they would trade Saudi oil for some good Ol’ made in America bone saws and acid vats.
64 2018-12-10 23:55:16 I want you to be the Priyanka to my Nick Jonas. Covering myself in coconut oil so I can slide into your dm’s
65 2018-12-10 23:55:14 That's not right, you have to use oil.

67 2018-12-10 23:54:57 Just get some oil, grapeseed, jojoba and almond are all good strengthing ones for nail growth, massage it on your cuticles whenever you have tne free time just never let your shits get dry. And also take biotin
68 2018-12-10 23:54:54 @TheYoungTurks @AnaKasparian @MarkTLive @johniadarola 
The reason they hate renewables is b/c energy basically gets close to free. Once you buy the solar panels you just pay for repairs. With oil and coal you pay FOREVER for every liter or for every single ton.
FOREVER!!

As a citizen of Canada, I call on the Prime Minister to go further & condemn specifically the actions of SA’s Crown Prince MBS,  human rights violations in SA & the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. BAN Saudi oil! END arms sales! #HumanRightsDay2018
70 2018-12-10 23:54:44 like I'm legit upset that they didn't think to include, idk, liquid liner? a lip oil? mini eyeshadow palette? SOMETHING
71 2018-12-10 23:54:19 bawa pempek 4kg, ayam geprek, bawa air softlens, remove komedo, olive oil seliter dll. q bingung wkwk
72 2018-12-10 23:54:18 Crypto "nutjobs" sound a lot like the gold/oil/biotech etc "nutjobs". Emotional, anxious, gamblers. Low IQ.

Crypto "naysayers" sound like bank analysts who build 5k line valuation models on stocks that often collapse. Low EQ.

Truth is somewhere in the middle $BTC $XRP #stocks
73 2018-12-10 23:54:17 If PMB only achievement is to kill corruption & retired corrupt politicians I will vote for continuity of PMB 4+4=8years;
An oil producing nation that can't provide water for it citizens for 16yrs does not need a party like PDP. PMB2019 No going back in shaa Allah #Nextlevel

75 2018-12-10 23:54:10 @neeratanden  Didn’t take the no oil donation pledge seriously.  
@BetoORourke  He did in fact take big donations from executives 

It’s clear ... 

@neeratanden  should apologize to @davidsirota
76 2018-12-10 23:54:05 A trainee position at an oil & gas depot...with or without salary
77 2018-12-10 23:54:03 Thank you! Unfortunately in Pennsylvania medical marijuana is basically only legal for ptsd, pain management, & maybe seizures. I sometimes use cbd oil, but I don’t see a huge difference with it. Thank you again & thank you for reaching out to others. Bless you.
78 2018-12-10 23:53:44 Nelson George's commentary on Driving Miss Daisy (from his book BLACKFACE) feels oddly appropriate in light of GREEN BOOK: "Whites loved this film, but to blacks it was old snake oil in a new bottle."
79 2018-12-10 23:53:40 Second point is that prices dropped due to oversupply. Ever hear of the Permian basin? It’s a massive oil reserve in Texas that has been taking off for the past 5 years and the US just became the largest producer in the world. Guess who that was under? Obama.
80 2018-12-10 23:53:36 Big mazzola oil serivce banners
81 2018-12-10 23:53:14 I always feel like the whole thing is gonna break down like?? Use some oil or?? Idk but DO something sjdjsj
82 2018-12-10 23:53:08 You would make a great snake oil salesman... You are so duplicitous and disingenuous it's breathtaking!
83 2018-12-10 23:53:08 I'm at the car dealership getting an oil change and the lady next to me has already smashed two bags of popcorn and two sodas. You do you, girl.
84 2018-12-10 23:52:46 When the Nigerian president at the time in 2014 complained and said due to such foriegn policies, he isnt sure if the USA is stil friends with Nigeria, he stopped importing Nigerias crude oil

He also helped topple the former Nigerian government and install the current admin
85 2018-12-10 23:52:31 So Quebec doesn’t want dirty Alberta oil...but they sure belly up to the equalization trough to the tune of $11B...WTF
86 2018-12-10 23:52:29 It's not a voluntary choice to be brave in that situation. You're simply forced to be by circumstance. You survive, you don't choose to endure the pain for a greater good.
87 2018-12-10 23:52:26 Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas and accelerate decarbonization. 

Cheaper than coal.
88 2018-12-10 23:52:26 All of our oil is not high sulpher bitumen. And all the majors are not swimming in profits. While the oilsands are big players, there is more to our energy are also a lot of jrs in the energy business who are ready to be foreclosed on. But you can live in your sheltered cocoon.
89 2018-12-10 23:52:25 Trump is trying to control inflation by bringing Oil prices down.  It will not work, It is going to be blood batch ahead. Deutsche bank, Brexit, Trade deal, China, Germany, UK economy slowing.  There is no reason to be bullish right now.
90 2018-12-10 23:52:22 Interesting . Not as interesting as the oil drum story tho.  2 daughters dead in an oil drum ? Text inside this story.
91 2018-12-10 23:52:18 ahh i have one dark scar which is so annoying :/ my creams are local remedies from the philippines so idk if i can help that much! but i think using tea tree oil is good! <33

93 2018-12-10 23:52:07 Drizzle with a little olive oil, bake in oven for 20 mins and then squeeze some fresh lemon Juice over them. #tasty
94 2018-12-10 23:51:57 But we have natural gas in Qatar that is vital to us and natural gas to liquids oil.
95 2018-12-10 23:51:47 Canadian oil is foreign oil
96 2018-12-10 23:51:45 Oil pulling for the W
97 2018-12-10 23:51:42 Dependency on a finite resource is dumb. This is not political. It’s fact. The future is renewable/green energy. GM gets it as do most companies/nations. Trump backing oil and coal in 2018 underscores how clueless he is. GM will do fine.
98 2018-12-10 23:51:36 which big fucker are we talking about are we talking about can’t get out of high rank snake oil man or rust boy
99 2018-12-10 23:51:35 Like wax which is what we dab, no. And if you’re talking actual Thc oil you’d be way better off just buying pre filled distillate carts
100 2018-12-10 23:51:34 No oil pipeline? Then no money pipeline! (And I'm an ashamed Quebecker.)
101 2018-12-10 23:51:29 I can say from a previous shoot that being absolutely covered in coconut oil makes your skin and hair feel greaaaat for days
102 2018-12-10 23:51:27 "Trump Ends" is obviously bullshit. US oil production has been growing dramatically for a decade.
103 2018-12-10 23:51:23 It seems like a lot of money gets poured into trying to get people to *like* entities such as health insurers or oil companies. Not gonna lie, it's probably better just to invest in QAnon shit to distract people
104 2018-12-10 23:51:23 Not sworn in yet, so...
105 2018-12-10 23:51:19 Why is an oil rig kicking Ted Cruz? I thought he supported fracking
106 2018-12-10 23:51:15 Employees who work the oil sector make a LOT of money and know their jobs are harmful but they - do -not -care.  Even if you bring up their kids lungs, they know, and they dont care. They can afford doctors. The dont understand the damage is PERMANENT.
107 2018-12-10 23:51:09 Taxation of E-Commerce in both Traditional Information System (TIS) and Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies based environments will move Nigeria from being Oil revenue dependent.
108 2018-12-10 23:51:05 Lean pockets > hot pockets 
They give you more cheese and less oil. 
109 2018-12-10 23:51:04 Remember to apply peppermint oil to your hair before any Christmas event to be extra festive
110 2018-12-10 23:50:59 Meanwhile in Washington.....
Aid: The young people re: GREEN NEW DEAL are here will you see them?
Nancy Pelosi: Yes of course I will.
Aid: I'll show them in
Nancy Pelosi: Will you deposit this cheque from the oil lobby for me.
Aid: Don't I always?
They both laugh.

111 2018-12-10 23:50:53 Canada needs to do a gender based analysis on all that Saudi oil....
112 2018-12-10 23:50:48 Not all fish oil supplements are created equal! The recommended dose for fish oil is 3000 DHA/EPA mg. Most often when it says 1000 mgs on the front, it does not mean 1000 mg of DHA/EPA. Read the back of the label to see what’s inside.

113 2018-12-10 23:50:48 I haven’t watched the feh trailer yet all I know is what people are posting on the tl. 

So is everyone goth now or..? Did feh say goth rights? How did Alfonse strike oil and is just sitting in a pool of it??? Who’s the hot goth person?
114 2018-12-10 23:50:36 Any of you lot ever tried CBD oil? If so, how have you gotten on with it?
115 2018-12-10 23:50:28 東芝の有価証券虚偽記載問題での逮捕者ゼロと比べてあまりにバランスが悪い。
過去虚偽記載で経営トップが逮捕された西武鉄道、カネボウ並みということか？そうは思えないが……
116 2018-12-10 23:50:22 Some would say yes! We add a lot of plastic to the planet. More important, why should a secretary at an oil company not be able to donate to the candidates of her liking, but I should?
117 2018-12-10 23:50:12 Cheaper and more economical (redundant?) does not mean being capable of replacing the potential energy capacity and availability of oil, natural gas, and especially coal (all three are renewable, if you want long enough). Time to end knee jerk solutions to find real replacements.
118 2018-12-10 23:50:06 Explain oil? 
119 2018-12-10 23:49:58 i orDERED OIL PASTELS AND THEY GAVE ME CHALK PASTELS AND IM FUCKING MAD IVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FOR THE WHOLE WEEK AND NOBODY IS GONNA UNDERSTAND THIS TWEET BUT I DONT FUCJING CARE ITS FOR ME
120 2018-12-10 23:49:58 Don't like oil and its products, shut in your gas meter, throw away your car keys, bus pass, stop shopping for groceries, they come by truck. Devolve yourselves. Live in caves and shiver.
121 2018-12-10 23:49:52 Just paid 70+ for a oil change for a Jeep tho ...So don’t ask me for nothing im am not the girls dem sugar ...
122 2018-12-10 23:49:18 Hm I really like the Neutrogena oil free moisture for combination skin. It moisturises the skin that’s dry and needs it, but it doesn’t over moisturise the skin that’s already oily! That’s what it claims it does anyway and I’ve been using it for a while now and I’d say it’s true!
123 2018-12-10 23:49:16 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
124 2018-12-10 23:49:15 Good. Had the car oil changed and had to wait. Fox was on so I told the guy in charge, either get Fox off right now or I’m leaving. He did. Wish I could have blocked it.
125 2018-12-10 23:48:47 My castor oil is almost done 
126 2018-12-10 23:48:19 Its still a subsidy to the oil industry. Where else are we fighting? The Russians and Chinese are no threats---don't even have air craft carriers! We have no need for a Navy (since fighter bombers can re-fuel in air) never mind 7 air carrier groups.
127 2018-12-10 23:48:12 yea right ... lets let some criminals out of jail early because some grandma stayed in jail due to a mistake ... that SOUNDS like the kind of argument SNAKE OIL SALESMEN USE .... pushing some BS like the Limousine Liberal #FirstStepAct
128 2018-12-10 23:48:01 I feel terrible that I have neglected bailey's teachings and not picked up the habit of bathing in coconut oil yet
129 2018-12-10 23:47:57 I watched it on Netflix. All about climate change and the politics and how the oil company’s are preventing us from fixing the problem.
130 2018-12-10 23:47:57 They still do it! Oil for a few days then a trip to matron and WHOOOSH
131 2018-12-10 23:47:52 Are you serious? Taking money from individuals who happen to work in the oil & gas industry is NOT the same as taking money from industry.
132 2018-12-10 23:47:49 Exactly this. If something is such a dire threat then why is their solution always to tax it rather than ban or restrict it?
133 2018-12-10 23:47:38 Shoe=fits
134 2018-12-10 23:47:38 Is this for medical purposes only?
I hear hemp oil has helped a lot of people. those that could afford to buy it. Help with pain too. But not good for fun. Why sign something U need to warn people about later? Like the Cigs, alcohol? That makes no sense! Later beg them to quite?
135 2018-12-10 23:47:17 I will forever love the way peppermint oil makes my scalp feel 
136 2018-12-10 23:47:01 I need an oil plug. 
137 2018-12-10 23:47:00 I actually read the article.
He made it to Brazil, stayed in a refugee camp for a spell, then found work in construction.

Sounds like old boy already found asylum, but it didn’t have all those sweet, sweet American gibs.
138 2018-12-10 23:46:56 you and I 
we're like, oil and water which will never combine due to density differences 
139 2018-12-10 23:46:54 Lol, the US govt is appropriating lands to drill for freaking oil. Screwing farmers with tariffs. Giving businesses tax breaks while leaving citizens behind.
140 2018-12-10 23:46:49 Cincinnati v. Standard Oil Co. of California. (1941) Calls to violence are an invasion of privacy.
141 2018-12-10 23:46:47 run for your life it's steven's bottle of oil
142 2018-12-10 23:46:44 The chemists used to be the only place where you could buy olive oil (Inc during the war) FOR THIS VERY REASON
143 2018-12-10 23:46:43 $SSOF No debt, over $12M annual revenues, over $15M net assets and profitable. Pending audit and fully SEC reporting and Pink current information Global oil and gas equipment industry projected to be worth $205 billion by 2020 Last time exploded from this level exploded to 0.02
144 2018-12-10 23:46:43 That is kind of what I guessed. That it masked the flavour with spices. But still. It can get annoying to avoid so many desserts because they are just sprinkled with almonds and all those places that use peanut oil for cooking.
145 2018-12-10 23:46:40 If Labour don’t get in does Owen Jones implode with such power he creates an alternate reality with just him on a desert island with Corbyn and 5000 gallons of baby oil?
146 2018-12-10 23:46:39 An oil fund ho ho ho . Is that to pay the government share of decommissioning.
147 2018-12-10 23:46:20 In the good old days a nurse at the GP's surgery would take a bloody great syringe, clear out all the wax in a whirligig of irrigation and it would suddenly feel like someone turned the treble up to max. But they frown on that now and it's all olive oil and waiting.
148 2018-12-10 23:46:19 lmao the manager at jiffy lube really wanted to fight me when they broke part of my car BEFORE the oil change was even finished. who the hell he thought broke it? me? LMAOOOO they funny
149 2018-12-10 23:46:12 I know right  we don’t agree politically but we both agree on the oil a lot.
150 2018-12-10 23:46:09 Sorry @SenSanders. It's been proven that dinosaurs are not what is making oil. There is no such thing as "fossil fuels", unless we are in Jurassic Park.
151 2018-12-10 23:46:09 Satu jam aku melayan customer nak cleansing oil for sensitive skin itupum bnyak karenahnya.
152 2018-12-10 23:46:03 What was used before palm oil?
153 2018-12-10 23:45:47 Can “a man” come check my car to see if I need to get a oil change
154 2018-12-10 23:45:47 Your hair is oily because you're over washing it. You wash away the natural oils so you then produce more oil to make for the oil you washed off. I used to have oily hair and switched to washing it 2 times a week, at most. Start weening your hair off of daily washes.
155 2018-12-10 23:45:46 Whip together 1/3 cup buritto with 9 tsps elderberry. Mix in Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve with salmon
156 2018-12-10 23:45:30 30 Times Oil Can Harry Was The Master Of The Insult
157 2018-12-10 23:45:30 Next it will be just across the river to Quebec,  the province that thinks oil is socially unacceptable.
158 2018-12-10 23:45:23 Or, we could avoid using palm oil?
There are alternatives after all.
159 2018-12-10 23:45:13 Texas toast. You come from wealthy oil people.
160 2018-12-10 23:45:12 You can’t pay for universal health care without Alberta oil
161 2018-12-10 23:45:10 That may just be self-preservation! Hot oil on the toes is no good.
162 2018-12-10 23:45:08 Brown sugar, regular sugar, vitamin e with coconut oil
163 2018-12-10 23:45:01 No need... Albertan will be lossed with no oil to live on....
164 2018-12-10 23:45:00 My mom bought me an essential oil diffuser for my room and says “I got this for you because I know you’re stressed about finals” ily mom 
165 2018-12-10 23:44:59 It’s so good, it’s just a blend of oils basically. Like, olive oil and coconut
166 2018-12-10 23:44:51 Yet, you make use o it every day and enjoy countless benefits because of it.
Either you are a very dirty boy or, oil by definition is energy.

BTW, "Oil is by definition dirty" is mindless drivel.
167 2018-12-10 23:44:49 I’ve oiled my lashes why tf are my eyes drowning in oil
168 2018-12-10 23:44:40 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be pursued or even cuddled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
169 2018-12-10 23:44:36 Why is everything cheaper in AB? I’ll bring a quart of oil to the concert here in Kelowna to make up the difference in price! My ticket came to $53.00 But in all honesty @AaronPritchett is worth it! 
170 2018-12-10 23:44:28 Israel has no oil. How does Israel pay OPEC and in what currency?
171 2018-12-10 23:44:26 This coconut oil trend is cool and all except for the fact that I'm ALLERGIC to coconut and now every beauty product has it...
172 2018-12-10 23:44:22 I will crush my fantasy 
Bring me olive oil crushed for his majesty
...
Got to crush my fantasies
Of how this life is supposed to be

-Silence, @matisyahu
173 2018-12-10 23:44:16 and Ms cooking oil?
174 2018-12-10 23:43:42 whole check goes to oil changes alone 
175 2018-12-10 23:43:40 The Witcher:
It was a breezy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about Berserkers. 'Use  Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
176 2018-12-10 23:43:36 There are still refineries in Canada?   It’d be great then if the price of gas had at least some correlation to price of oil.
177 2018-12-10 23:43:35 using thayers non alcoholic toner every night/morning reallllly helped clear my skin out. also, rosehip & vitamin E oil. natural remedies do wonders/are better for skin and usually cheaper. tj max always has rlly good skin oils for cheap.
178 2018-12-10 23:43:31 Kuwait isn't evil, it's just dependent on oil revenue. They already started initiatives to go solar its just the government wont just stop its revenue production unless there is an already existing alternative - which there isnt.
179 2018-12-10 23:43:29 As did your dear leader Trump
180 2018-12-10 23:43:29 The world will wait to see how the greatest and most powerful friend of Saudi Arabia and, at the moment, the world’s largest producer of oil - the US - responds. If the President takes a pass the Congress can still act.
181 2018-12-10 23:43:18 How they have oil and a deficit/debt is beyond me.
182 2018-12-10 23:43:14 Just one more thing: the oil sands contribute to just 2% of Canada’s GDP, equal to the electric power industry.
183 2018-12-10 23:43:14 His Jesuit roots wouldn't permit standing heroically. He's trained to serve the greater good: collectivism isn't interested in individualism. That's why he supported reducing oil, not letting supply and demand find the balance. Gov't intervention in economy is socialism.
184 2018-12-10 23:43:12 The U.S. delegation at COP24 was literally laughed at as they made a presentation about coal, natural gas and oil. It was their only public event. "Our policy is not to leave it in the ground," they said. #ActOnClimate
185 2018-12-10 23:43:11 Comparing Bitumen to oil is like saying wheat kernels are croissants. One needs a Billion-$ Coker upgrader to process the Dilbit that comes down the pipe (Bitumen mixed with diluent), which is why Quebec imports real oil! EE was export only. Most refineries cannot process Bitumen
186 2018-12-10 23:43:07 Coconut oil is not going to work it’s only to moisturize you need something with protein like keratin products please don’t bother listening to anyone that says coconut oil
187 2018-12-10 23:43:05 Took y'all long enough to realize that you can profit more off of legalization than criminalization... unless you're big oil or big pharma. Going to be interesting to see how the "big" lobbyists respond to this one.
188 2018-12-10 23:43:01 This one is infused coconut oil,  apricot oil,  emu oil,  mango butter,  beeswax, arnica essential oil, peppermint oil, sweet birch oil and lavender oil. Always tweaking things and happy to get new ideas 
189 2018-12-10 23:42:56 I’d pay to see that, they’d be at each other’s throats in no time..... that is oil and water
190 2018-12-10 23:42:45 น่าสนมากค่ะ
191 2018-12-10 23:42:44 Everyone? All 28 million? Not really, but that perception is the problem. The country doesn't want oil & gas. And that's not what's slowly turning Texas blue. The country certainly doesn't want another George W.
192 2018-12-10 23:42:37 She and Hemingway were oil and water
193 2018-12-10 23:42:24 Quebec gov't doesn't want Alberta oil but will take Alberta money in equalization payment. Fuck them government officials up the ass with a cactus. #cdnpoli
194 2018-12-10 23:42:17 tastes like motor oil con limon
195 2018-12-10 23:42:16 It is all part of the collusion master plan to drive down oil prices to help Russia.
196 2018-12-10 23:42:13 Stupidity, car ins only covers if your car get's in an accident, if it needs new tires? Nope. Oil change? Nope. Starter goes bad? Nope. Accidents lower than deductible? Nope. Accidents over the value of car? Nope. Make a claim your rates go UP. No HC shouldn't be like car ins.
197 2018-12-10 23:42:08 I mean coconut oil is a good moisturizer and lube so you get a soft pp and it smells great
198 2018-12-10 23:41:29 Coconut oil hair mask by palmers is amazing, would suggest you leave it overnight!
199 2018-12-10 23:41:20 Not sure why you’ve mentioned tartan is that your attempt at humor if so it’s pathetic but oil and gas is significant Scotland has produced more of the stuff than Norway our fishing waters are second to Norway our food exports exceed Norway’s
200 2018-12-10 23:41:18 It’s that he’s just a lying, snake oil salesman. So sleazy. It just upsetting this guy is our leader.
201 2018-12-10 23:40:58 Oh really,  then with oil prices at unprecedented lows why is gas so expensive?
202 2018-12-10 23:40:53 I've done my fair share to pull oil out of the ground.
And I know that a lot of good has come of the stuff and how important it is to our technologies. 
But it's time to make a change.

Maybe you should also look to make a change, and cool down a bit in your Twitter discussions.
203 2018-12-10 23:40:51 Arabs got that new new oil money, Indians got that thousands of years old money
204 2018-12-10 23:40:50 Vanessa Bell Armstrong @dr_vbamusic - Oil of God
205 2018-12-10 23:40:36 You are SO lucky they didn't hack you up and send you home in an oil barrel!
206 2018-12-10 23:40:31 Nepa improved a bit .. you won’t mention. 

You’ve also ignored the fact that he’s working with lesser money as compared to past govt where crude oil price was higher that we currently have.
207 2018-12-10 23:40:28 My coconut smells like dick oil.
208 2018-12-10 23:40:26 imagine one province, Alta, thought it's needs should supersede those of the their neighbouring province, BC, for whom many citizens n species depend on the Pacific ocean's bounty and which increased oil tanker traffic threatens . Imagine not caring about balancing needs of both
209 2018-12-10 23:40:11 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
210 2018-12-10 23:40:09 Inveja pura
211 2018-12-10 23:40:07 Read: the majors have absolutely no problem with access! EE was export only. Quebec CANNOT process high-sulfur Bitumen which is why it imports REAL oil. Incidentally not from the Saudis. That's fake news. Comparing Bitumen to oil is like saying Wheat kernels are croissants.
212 2018-12-10 23:40:05 It is sickening, disgusting, infuriating, & unforgivable.  Those "lawmakers" should be boiled in oil...slowly.
213 2018-12-10 23:40:05 I don't believe you.
Fracking:  the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean  rocks, boreholes, etc., so as to force open existing fissures and  extract oil or gas.
214 2018-12-10 23:39:57 2 tsp olive oil. Cap with cotton. Keep ear upside while sleeping. Drown that thing. #oldremedy
215 2018-12-10 23:39:52 Also worth noting that when one industry gains, another loses. When the Oil industry took over, manufacturing declined steeply and there were a lot of disgruntled manufacturing employees. So those people could argue manufacturing funded huge amts of economic and social success.
216 2018-12-10 23:39:25 May we never have to squeeze an olive to get oil.
217 2018-12-10 23:39:20 おはようございます！！！！
218 2018-12-10 23:39:17 Beto: "I swear not to take money from oil execs over $200!"

Libs: "Yay!"

Beto: *takes money from oil execs over $200*

Shitlibs: "I don't see anything wrong here. Beto 2020!"
219 2018-12-10 23:39:17 Awesome work.... i got ur glasses now for the oil....
220 2018-12-10 23:39:11 You know what I use to follow Oil demand? It’s called the New York Stock Exchange. It has real time supply/demand updates Monday-Friday. You’ll be amazed when you discover it!
221 2018-12-10 23:39:09 Oil is by definition dirty... we need to move away from fossil fuel.
222 2018-12-10 23:39:09 わたし今から家出るけど出たくないでーーーす！！！／(^o^)＼がんばろ……がんばろ……。
223 2018-12-10 23:39:08 My dick smells like coconut oil
224 2018-12-10 23:38:59 two squares of ghiradelli 100% baking chocolate, some coconut oil, more green juice and sauerkraut
225 2018-12-10 23:38:56   Paul Ryan is a snake oil merchant. As is every conservative who pushes the scam of “supply side economics”. They have no right questioning anybody’s competence.
226 2018-12-10 23:38:53 (@OIL_SEKIYU_r6s ) \(´・ω・｀)どぞ
227 2018-12-10 23:38:21 #RT @Greenpeace: … but we’ll be watching Wilmar to make sure that words mean action on the ground. 2019 must be the year we take massive steps to clean up this industry and put an end to the era of dirty palm oil. 2/4
228 2018-12-10 23:38:16 Yeah, like the crimes @realDonaldTrump and his people committed.

Are y’alls head really THAT far in the sand?
I mean I get it’s tough to admit you got conned by this snake oil selling grifter and all, but trumps been doin that his whole life don’t feel too bad about it.
229 2018-12-10 23:38:13 Oil or water based, smocking guns got you covered.
230 2018-12-10 23:38:10 Short sided policy on pipelines and offshore drilling can also have long term effects. Oil spills in Gulf of Mexico, Alaskan spill
 What do you think that costs were to our economy.
231 2018-12-10 23:38:06 Bitchhhhh, $75 for an oil change? can I have my car back plz thx
232 2018-12-10 23:37:52 I dont give a shit what a small handful of VCs think. I don't give a shit if green energy is "less profitable" (it isn't). I care about saving lives. I don't give a shit if those lives cost the paychecks of oil CEOs.

I don't worship at the alter of CEOs. I'm not a bootlicker.
233 2018-12-10 23:37:50 Oh I’m in complete agreement. I just think in a 31 soon to be 32 team league with tons of TV timeouts, etc. more teams will do this to cover avg. rosters. So you actually need to cheer for Colorado b/c if heavy usage hurts them, it hurts the Oil.
234 2018-12-10 23:37:44 Wow. 4 countries who rely heavily on oil or are heavily influenced by oil. Wonder why they are against endorsing it.
235 2018-12-10 23:37:39 @edwardlucas :-) I'm a babyboomer and I don't drive, drink, eat meat or buy palm oil - I TRY to avoid plastic. I'm happier too! I wish I didn't know the 6th Extinction has begun tho - but, Happy Holidays, Edward! I'm also gonna enjoy whatever I can
236 2018-12-10 23:37:15 Yes pot Has proven to be a wonderful medicinal treatment for all your ills so I suggest you start smoking pot again immediately. By the way the oil form of marijuana is being used on dogs with pain/ discs-  and guess what it works like a charm
237 2018-12-10 23:37:14 I was like just an oil change & filter? I can go anywhere for that. Also I’m only going to have my car for a few more weeks why would I pay $200 and give it back for someone else to have it? They were trying to sell me $500 run flat tires earlier this year lmao
238 2018-12-10 23:36:42 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
239 2018-12-10 23:36:42 That’s oil
240 2018-12-10 23:36:41 i recommend the olive oil shortbread with rosemary and chocolate recipe from food52/ deb perelman but don’t do the egg white part so that it can be vegan and everyone can enjoy!!!
241 2018-12-10 23:36:40 for oil paint: old holland, williamsburg, + gamblin | alcohol ink: pinata . .
242 2018-12-10 23:36:18 Human rights as long as you don’t live above oil fields!
243 2018-12-10 23:35:44 My man got my oil change 
244 2018-12-10 23:35:42 Good to see that someone besides Alex Steffan sees that this is all about the oil endgame with Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Trmp administration all part of it.  They're gonna burn all they can while they can then demand we all to pay for their "stranded assets."
245 2018-12-10 23:35:22 The trick might be setting up an entirely new energy delivery system that is cheaper than using oil, in Saudi Arabia.  Nobody believes this is the reason the technology is desired.  Nice try though.
246 2018-12-10 23:35:16 Oga be laughing dia o. The oil that we will use to fry chicken 4 Adenike people 
247 2018-12-10 23:35:00 Dark skin problems ... I always gotta do baby oil and lotion
248 2018-12-10 23:34:58 The US is RULED by greedy, ignorant corporations who only care about PROFITS!
We will collapse because of OVERPOPULATION & climate heating that will destroy our OIL DEPENDENT FACTORY FARMING. "Renewables" cannot replace OIL because technology cannot replace RESOURCES!
249 2018-12-10 23:34:47 Palm oil cream straight up! Pele
250 2018-12-10 23:34:46 paid the £23 shipping....and now I have to pay another £13 in tax at the post office ??! this cbd oil better remove all negativity from my life
251 2018-12-10 23:34:37 A pledge not to accept money from oil execs is a broken pledge pure and simple. Props for that release of info, it SHOULD be released. It is relevant, yet still limited in value.
252 2018-12-10 23:34:23 who tf supposed to tell me when to get an “oil change”, whatever that is
253 2018-12-10 23:34:19 All my clothes have oil stains from cooking.  imma buy an apron soon.
254 2018-12-10 23:34:11 @JenniferGrayCNN @chadmyerscnn @realDonaldTrump Get all the polluting souls to capture the CO2 and dispose it beyond mars. It is very easy. These souls go to sun to clean up their dirt. Stop importing oil if these souls do not cooperate.
255 2018-12-10 23:34:08 12? That's a lathe mill. The slightest mistake on a CNC machine with a piece of gear worth 1000s on it. If it crashes more damage again. Way, way easier just do drawings of pipes in Intel, pharma plant, oil and gas.
256 2018-12-10 23:34:04 If they really believed society would collapse within the next couple decades, they would be buying land in the mountains and stockpiling guns.

Seriously, if they could convince me that this was coming, screw the world. I would be trying to find a way for my kids to survive.
257 2018-12-10 23:33:53 Pete screaming i need some oil sheen ayfuccinyoooo

265 2018-12-10 23:32:56 I love how everyone mad at this rant is of the opinion that all tesla critics are schills for "big oil" and spend their days shorting teslas stock. It has nothing to do with overhyped fan boys on twitter who blindly defend every word out of his mouth, just LOL man.......
266 2018-12-10 23:32:34 In what?  If she really cared about our FN people she would know how the  bands have prospered from their oil sands and the jobs it has created. Our FN people in Alberta want to work and prosper but the government doesn’t want that.
267 2018-12-10 23:32:33 Careful with that oil Terry
268 2018-12-10 23:32:31 Hahaha subhanallah 
269 2018-12-10 23:32:27 The other would have been oil.
270 2018-12-10 23:32:22 Right.  #Beto lying about not taking large oil/gas lobby money is not a scandal because we have become so complacent about the ethics of The Electeds.
271 2018-12-10 23:32:19 Thanks to Twitter I finally researched the difference, learned what chremslach are and that some prefer to fry latkes in olive oil, some scmaltz, still others groundnut oil.
But can curried vegetable latkes be really considered latkes at all?
272 2018-12-10 23:32:16 burt’s bees facial oil straight from ulta up made my eczema non existent, boscia rosewater & witch hazel mist keeps my makeup from cracking in the winter, & body shop’s drips of youth concentrate is the end-all-be-all anti aging serum for all skin types
273 2018-12-10 23:32:10 Which essential oil is good for getting more money in my bank account?
274 2018-12-10 23:32:06 Talk to me when you can afford your own gas or oil changes 
275 2018-12-10 23:32:06 No o. With groundnut oil ni
276 2018-12-10 23:31:59 Leave it to me to change my oil in the driveway and run over the oil pan 
277 2018-12-10 23:31:45 Oil industry employment in Texas is a lot smaller than people think.
278 2018-12-10 23:31:36 I wanna punch my brother in his throat right now with his old ass cause he don’t even know how tf to check oil, don’t be fucking yelling at me, you the one who needs the jump
279 2018-12-10 23:31:30 My first job I had was at a Union 76 gas station. Started out as a pump jockey, then went to lube and oil ,tires then light mechanical.
Fuel pumps, water pumps, brakes, Transmissions ,fuel lines and assorted other things short of tune-ups.
I was 16.
280 2018-12-10 23:31:26 Girl something is fishy. I’m going back tomorrow and letting them know. Cause I haven’t noticed in oil leaking out  caused my engine light and everything to come on.

283 2018-12-10 23:31:12 What the hell does that have to do with oil and transfer payments to Quebec?
284 2018-12-10 23:31:11 I need to go essential oil shopping like asap

287 2018-12-10 23:30:48 It does not matter if you are a denier or  not if you arent willing to kill the fossil fuel industry.

He shied away from a $10/barrel tax on oil as if it were poison.
288 2018-12-10 23:30:34 Snake Oil Salesman and nothing more
289 2018-12-10 23:30:34 To be fair isn’t this in part also read as: “without breaks from the outrageous taxes and fees on oil production...”

291 2018-12-10 23:30:26 Are you saying that his constituents that are employed by the oil industry are worth less than others?
292 2018-12-10 23:30:25 Yes... but there are equally some genuine, very nice, long term holders here who have put their all into this and deserve to do well.
293 2018-12-10 23:30:10 Science confirms astonishing medicinal properties of CBD oil￼

The research is coming out: CBD oil, full of cannabinoids, is a powerful natural medicine with scientifically-validated health benefits. #naturalnews.com
294 2018-12-10 23:30:05 Wait a minute. Was it not confirmed that these fossil fuel (non-PAC) donations to Beto’s campaign came from *individual* donors who work for oil/gas companies? This seems like deliberate disinformation.
295 2018-12-10 23:30:05 I often forget that oil changes are a thing my vehicle needs.
296 2018-12-10 23:30:02 Everyone needs CBD oil
297 2018-12-10 23:30:00 Influencers are this generation’s snake oil salesmen
298 2018-12-10 23:29:42 was putting castor oil on my lashes while listening to music then the whole brush went inside my eye i think im permanently blind
299 2018-12-10 23:29:33 Peak oil was settled science....
300 2018-12-10 23:29:25 White tea as much as possible. Zinc and d3 for vitamins. Thieves oil on hands, ears and feet. Juice some beats, ginger, carrots and oranges. Drink immediately. Steam and sauna.
301 2018-12-10 23:29:22 This week has been a financial shit show it's only logical that my dryer would die Tonite. Def not an expense I needed. So much for the cc I would only use for oil then pay off...it's been oil, dental surgery, groceries and dryer. #nolongerdebtfree
302 2018-12-10 23:29:15 Oil rich in Africa does not mean, they have money for their own country. 
Just means they have oil to benefit a few of its countries elite and a bunch of European companies/governments.
So they have to borrow to take care of the country..

305 2018-12-10 23:29:02 Finished the 10 ml ( -_-) 'bottle' of my Bella's cbd oil, and what can I say... well, she's still walking. Although her limp is really pronounced. One thing that happened while she was on the oil is that her 'cycle' came back. She hadn't had one in quite a awhile.
306 2018-12-10 23:28:46 I feel like my whole body could go through a bunch of coconut oil. Like a giant tub of coconut oil. Any new mama’s out there experience itchy skin after giving birth? #newmom #question #itchyskin

312 2018-12-10 23:28:32 I mean, if I was running for senator and pledged not to take oil/gas money, I wouldn't feel too great about even the small donor ones. But that isn't even the point. He took money from executives.

314 2018-12-10 23:28:27 might go to guit*r c*nter to look around/ ask employees for oil pens

316 2018-12-10 23:28:02 Pumpkin spice oil lookin ass
317 2018-12-10 23:28:02 This is how Obama made us the largest oil producer in the world.
318 2018-12-10 23:27:57 My apologies, Captain Literal. I didn't realize you had a sub-grade-9-level understanding of Canadian government and HofC (that's House of Commons) procedures. Mr. Scheer wasn't actually asking if Trudeau or the gov't was buying the oil, but all of Canada is implied.
319 2018-12-10 23:27:55 climate change disasters never factor in an oil shill's considerations for the future and what's best for it
320 2018-12-10 23:27:49 Word 
321 2018-12-10 23:27:47 Both Conservative and Liberal governments have enabled purchasing Saudi oil, they have both been incompetent.
322 2018-12-10 23:27:47 I got a oil change 4 days ago so please tell me how my car has no oil in it. 
323 2018-12-10 23:27:44 Supposedly Coconut Oil helps.
324 2018-12-10 23:27:38 You don’t think they could sell every drop of oil they produce to the USA?
325 2018-12-10 23:27:32 Doubt many representatives from TX are going to be supporting eliminating the entire oil/gas industry - I'm good with us just losing all TX elections if that's the position though.
326 2018-12-10 23:27:07 I’ll let you know what happens this week but I was thinking coconut oil on the stovetop.
327 2018-12-10 23:26:50 I think some guys r just being there with the girl ne for the sake of they like her but can't have her as a wife
Girls do that a lot too, they will accept you and date you but can't marry you!
Shiit happens 
328 2018-12-10 23:26:22 Nice. I know what my next oil will be.
329 2018-12-10 23:26:18 Snake Oil. "Negative ions"? 100% B.S.
330 2018-12-10 23:26:08 I had my check engine light go off first thing this morning.  Mine was $50 worth of oil pressure sensor and filter.  We both got off pretty well.
331 2018-12-10 23:26:03 Soooo you don’t use oil , or gas , or any plastics at all ?
332 2018-12-10 23:25:59 How quickly would the US have swooped in to spread "liberty, democracy, and freedom for all" if #France had oil? Hmmm... #GiletsJaunes #YellowVests
333 2018-12-10 23:25:56 Kinda embarrassing when you are getting your oil changed and they tell you pop your hood and you have no idea how to 
334 2018-12-10 23:25:29 So a Dem scandal is a Texas candidate taking donations from the gas & oil industry..
335 2018-12-10 23:25:22 We need to get off the addiction of oil.  One way or another, it will be the ruin of us all.
336 2018-12-10 23:25:19 @JesseBWatters KNOWS WHAT BOTOX COSTS. .DOES HE THINK WE'RE STUPID AND THAT BABY SMOOTH FOREHEAD IS FROM BABY OIL?
337 2018-12-10 23:25:04 has been talk about closing it for decades. Oil and gas prices fluctuate wind is surprisingly unreliable. (and biggest con with regards to carbon credits). I'm out of touch with anyone at ESB but it must be squeaky bum time if we have prolonged cold weather and no wind
338 2018-12-10 23:25:03 But are they safe around oil paints?
339 2018-12-10 23:24:49 Nooo. Buy Jersey sweet potatoes, peel, cut 1/2” plus slices, coat with olive oil, kosher salt and roast. Heaven.
340 2018-12-10 23:24:26 how many donations did you get from the oil industry Rick
341 2018-12-10 23:24:20 I'm sorry but when you heat it the oil comes out and the proteins refold. Unless you keep it molten it will be brittle when solid.

Is the submarine a liquid?

Materials science? Worked in Switzerland?  Why yes now you ask.

Cheese studies required
342 2018-12-10 23:24:12 9 times outta 10 you’ll find oil on one of my shirts somewhere.
343 2018-12-10 23:24:07 Weigh out nine pinches of olive oil and set aside.
344 2018-12-10 23:24:05 Norway is impressive also because ; It is a very wealthy country thanks to oil extraction.... and also because there is 0% tax on electric cars

The tea today is @BarackObama has an Argentina deal he were desperately trying to hold on to. He apparently sold you ( Salethia Kennedy, Phenomenon) to and wanted to go into Oil -
348 2018-12-10 23:23:11 Why does Quebec take dirty oil money 
349 2018-12-10 23:23:09 I def need oil but different fire
350 2018-12-10 23:22:49 #TFW your car is being weird and you roll into get an oil change and their like - lady you have barely any oil in your car. #donttellmydad
351 2018-12-10 23:22:47 So weird that the Top 3 oil producing countries in the world won't endorse a climate change report. 
352 2018-12-10 23:22:42 Yes as far as NAKED   Emperors are concerned Snake Oil, has fooled the MSM " THRONG ". Bring on , THE CHILDREN
353 2018-12-10 23:22:25 Anyone with stock in the oil companies should dump it. That's where it will hurt them. Invest in Solar energy.
354 2018-12-10 23:22:20 Red Wine Vinegar Olive Oil and pinch of Salt
355 2018-12-10 23:22:19 Don’t think about it and massage your scalp with argan oil, it’ll grow lol
356 2018-12-10 23:22:19 to anyone wanna get a christmas present my car needs an oil change
357 2018-12-10 23:22:17 Both are good looking cars. Thanks for sponsoring a great racer like @BradSweet49 NAPA! I’ll be sure to keep using your oil filters since you sponsor my fav driver!
358 2018-12-10 23:22:15 @sdrevik Finally opened those packages, which I had thought were early-ordered Xmas presents from relatives. Trying to decide what to do with the truffle oil beyond the obvious, and the vinegar tastes lovely. Thanks!
359 2018-12-10 23:22:05 then you begin to realize that the nation of israel is all about controlling oil pipelines
360 2018-12-10 23:22:03 おはようございます

あざまーす(´∀｀)
361 2018-12-10 23:21:45 You seem to be confused as to what “gender” means. What exactly gender is oil? Take your pick..... pick one and support your reasoning.
362 2018-12-10 23:21:45 All three have done the math on the world giving up oil.
363 2018-12-10 23:21:39 All big oil producing countries.
364 2018-12-10 23:21:36 Bury me in a vat of Mongolian Fire Oil
365 2018-12-10 23:21:32 I mean, bartender might be giving her a little too much credit.  I doubt you could find anything that she has tweeted that is factually accurate.  She can't defend anything she says, it's pretty funny.
366 2018-12-10 23:21:19 Or, this is what happens when the top three oil and gas producers in the world review a climate change document.
367 2018-12-10 23:21:19 It's all bonds, right? So can't they just wait let them mature? Like using the oil to fuel the tanker while it sails around in the middle of the ocean. 
368 2018-12-10 23:21:14 @TheRealSkitzz p 800x800 0pl oil.
369 2018-12-10 23:21:01 Why the fuck is it taking over an hour to get an oil change. There are literally 3 customers here and I HAD A GOD DAMN APPOINTMENT 
370 2018-12-10 23:20:53 yes, my dog had thrown up and wouldn't eat for a few days. she must have had a stomach bug because I gave her 5 drops of full spectrum oil on a treat. In 45 min, she felt better & ate a full bowl.  CBG helped I bet
371 2018-12-10 23:20:51 ポンコツイケメン勇者
372 2018-12-10 23:20:50 Yes I'm sure the 30 odd oil executives and lobbyists maxing out to his campaign did so with the hopes that he would regulate the everloving piss out of their industry to stave off an extinction event.
373 2018-12-10 23:20:46 We still rely on oil 
374 2018-12-10 23:20:43 Don't forget Oil Trough.
375 2018-12-10 23:20:38 I have no loyalty. I enjoy catalogue-ing. 

Might pop out and buy some Azaela Grapeseed Oil 1L later in the week. 

I believe it’s half price, from Wednesday.
376 2018-12-10 23:20:32 I think that all gasoline stations and oil supplier to electric company should close for 2weeks let see how they like it.
377 2018-12-10 23:20:27 Oil!!
378 2018-12-10 23:20:26 that's when you realize the collusion between oil tycoons and saudi princes. people in politics, regardless which party, are all on the take
379 2018-12-10 23:20:25 Sure, why not?  As long as he DJ's all the WH functions.
380 2018-12-10 23:20:20 I started using coconut oil again and put a lemon in my water and honestly.... I’m drinking more water and I think it’s fixed everything so cheers to that
381 2018-12-10 23:20:20 'Highly Active' Seedworm Group Hits IT Services, Governments. Since September, the cyber espionage actors have targeted more than 130 victims in 30 organizations including NGOs, oil and gas, and telecom businesses. #infosec #CyberSecurity
382 2018-12-10 23:20:18 To remind ourselves that it takes a miracle for candles or oil to burn a long time.
383 2018-12-10 23:20:12 Eso con la misma grasa que bota el jamón de cocinar se hace no need for oil
384 2018-12-10 23:20:10 Yeah they don’t ship our oil out of Texas they refine it and sell it
385 2018-12-10 23:20:09 I assume the one on the right is covered in olive oil ??
386 2018-12-10 23:20:04 "individuals who work for oil/gas companies" is an interesting way to say "oil and gas executives"
387 2018-12-10 23:20:01 The Rockefeller bankrupt got a share of our oil
388 2018-12-10 23:19:56 Why is my oil change $80
389 2018-12-10 23:19:55 Donna in all sincerity can you reference where and who the "we've|" is in giving billions for the oil sands.
390 2018-12-10 23:19:53 And it is not acceptable that when oil companies bring in billions of profits, they pay less taxes in Canada than elsewhere. Perhaps they should share. BC doesn't benefit from your wealth so your argument has zero merit.
391 2018-12-10 23:19:23 Why Fresh Oil?

1. Fresh Oil becomes required when the old oil is no longer effective. 1 Samuel 3; The oil upon Eli was old such that he could no longer hear from God.
I pray for you today; God will never depart from you.

395 2018-12-10 23:19:10 A marine Corp general and gold star parent disgraced his honor by lying and supporting a liar. That's the hard part of this situation, he gave so much to this country then sold the rest

399 2018-12-10 23:18:04 We don’t want palm oil in our chocolate.... that’s why we eat @WhittakersNZ
400 2018-12-10 23:18:01 I wished that worked. Never has for me. The oil is working and thankfully I found they have unscented..
401 2018-12-10 23:17:51 I really thought this was an oil painting...wow
402 2018-12-10 23:17:50 Big oil does not want more support. They want a pipeline build so they can sell their product. Without access to market the taxes/royalties that make up equalization pmts will either end or the other 8 provinces are going to have chip in a hell've alot more to keep QC happy.
403 2018-12-10 23:17:45 On Friday the guy at the car shop told me he went over the entire car and there’s nothing wrong with it, today he tells me I have engine failure and metal in my oil system????
404 2018-12-10 23:17:42 Ever since I learned that tea tree oil is a great acne spot treatment, my life has been better
405 2018-12-10 23:17:20 You a mechanic bruh. So when can you change my oil?! Lmaoooo you know how to do that to?
406 2018-12-10 23:17:18 If one can focus on global injustice, treat people equally and solve debt to Africans countries, let oil  $ to solve problems of ordinary people's M Est, not wall street, then u've a chance fix imigration problem
407 2018-12-10 23:17:11 You shouldn't be meeting with anyone from this despicable regime! I guess being a whre for the oil companies allows you to forget the journalist they murdered and the civilians they've killed in Yemen. Oh yeah, your memory never was very good at all was it Rick "OOPS" Perry??
408 2018-12-10 23:17:02 Let's see...US oil production as a whole has been roaring ahead...For sure far faster than demand can keep up. And even today the price action in WTI was terrible.
409 2018-12-10 23:17:00 Know what..offended China and see the palm oil prices slump because China stop buying. This isn't brave but stupidity.
410 2018-12-10 23:16:55 Hopefully it's not too bad I think it's cause I just put new oil in it without changing the filter or old oil. But we'll see
411 2018-12-10 23:16:54 Olive oil is essential!

414 2018-12-10 23:16:36 There is also the issue of emergency procurement of processed oil which shareholders hve alleged was done in instances that in their opinion wld not qualify as an emergency. This also needs to b looked into. That was totally ignored or not addressed by the PM.
415 2018-12-10 23:16:29 I recommend using raw shea butter in the mean time during the day and vitamin e oil before bed
416 2018-12-10 23:16:20 Palm oil big time in Nutella ! Not brill for the system, so they say...
417 2018-12-10 23:16:16 Imma have your body sweating like you dipped in baby oil
418 2018-12-10 23:16:07 When they say there’s nothing wrong with your car. Yeah, bish. I know. Change my oil and get me outta here  #172Kmilesandcounting #HondaLife
419 2018-12-10 23:16:01 Check out the Vikings 800-1200AD. There was a warming trend at that time and it gave them the ability to expand it all the way to North America. Then the little ice age came in and basically shut them down. Guess it was all them thar Aztecs & Mayans with their oil production 
420 2018-12-10 23:16:00 #FACT: The oil boom is responsible for generating MILLIONS in surplus funds for the state of New Mexico!
421 2018-12-10 23:15:56 Problem is no one ever changed the oil in the supercharger. If it had over 100k miles the supercharger was probably about to shell out.
422 2018-12-10 23:15:56 On paper, #Venezuela has the makings of paradise: 300B barrels of #oil + #gold #chocolate & #coffee. Every day is sunny & the beaches are pristine. It COULD be a trade & tourism juggernaut. Instead, it’s a smoldering crater of financial ruin. How’d it happen? Ask @NicolasMaduro
423 2018-12-10 23:15:50 I think Solar energy and all energy should be free to the people. Nobody should own the power from the Sun. We should create a public solar utility and use it to reduce energy costs to people. Probably should nationalize the oil companies too at least charge an extraction tax.
424 2018-12-10 23:15:47 Our cord had found their answer on top of my oil for parties.
425 2018-12-10 23:15:27 Self medicate.  A lot of us vets are. CBD oil is amazing with helping with pain.
426 2018-12-10 23:15:12 Methanolic leaves extract of C.papaya was reported to have Antihelmenthes properties, does the oil from the seeds have any reported medicinal properties? Just curious, a further research on the medicinal effects of the oil will be of help. DM pls for further discussion

428 2018-12-10 23:15:09 Yes because of the capacity carried. That is my problem with cars. They reduce too far the capacity carried which creates energy inefficiencies. We should not transition from oil burning cars to electric cars, but away from cars altogether.
429 2018-12-10 23:15:06 Is it true that many claiming sustainable palm oil are running shadow companies so they can't be traced to their continued corruption? What measures are being put in place to prevent this from happening? How can we be certain a sustainable palm oil company is genuine?
430 2018-12-10 23:15:01 So you’re saying the only oil that goes to Quebec is from US/CDN? 

Does Quebec run socialized refineries that only buy from those two?
431 2018-12-10 23:14:58 I think I’m going to step out of my graphite zone and start experimenting with oil paints soon
432 2018-12-10 23:14:52 But let's agree that even the shield thing was an improvement over the original, where you stood in a bathtub, buck naked, as the ordinance workers poured oil on you and blessed you as they rubbed it all over. 

This was after the whiskey cleansing, of course.
433 2018-12-10 23:14:19 I rubbed lavender oil on my wrists and temples still dololo boroko.

435 2018-12-10 23:14:04 Go ahead and ride that  sir. Aren’t you aware this is all bullshit scare tactics-
we have a surplus of our own oil. We don’t need any foreign oil.
We should be sanctioning the hell out of the Saudi assholes. They’ve murdered a legal resident of the US.

438 2018-12-10 23:14:00 My province may be sitting on oil but now I find myself working in America because Canadians and their politics have made it almost impossible for me to work and save for retirement. People like yourself need to realize that I'm not alone and something has to change.
439 2018-12-10 23:13:51 Oil money darn well is apparently.  Hypocrites of the first order.
440 2018-12-10 23:13:45 Coconut oil is the best because it's thicker, but I've found grape seed oil works well too. I think some have even used olive oil but... I'd suggest coconut, remember push it through your teeth not just swish and do it for 20 seconds. Your jaw will be sore

450 2018-12-10 23:13:02 This is my FAVORITE time of the year for your channel!! Your skin routine last year had me and my sister SHOOOOK. I now put oil AFTER moisturizer and it has made such a difference 
451 2018-12-10 23:12:41 She didn’t say he was a coward, she is calling a military general out, who took an oath, that he lied and owes the person an apology. At least in the tweet you showed.

453 2018-12-10 23:12:39 Ignore the trolls like I am Tom and think about this. Why not make a clean energy powered plane? I've sen them do amazing things with water powered cars that handle like V8s. It would certainly show the world what is possible and bring us beyond buying oil.

461 2018-12-10 23:11:27 it would be highly inappropriate for the PM to admit guilt on something that’s not clear & needs further investigation. be reminded that the loses span two different admin, and it’s not fair to call MP Weathly a thief, nothing in the report suggests profits from the missing oil
462 2018-12-10 23:11:18 Quebec is sitting on a treasure trove of minerals. But mining and the oil business are taboo. So they’d rather sit on the minerals and receive cheques from Canada. Nice partners. Canada is getting ripped off. #cdnpoli #onpoli

469 2018-12-10 23:10:22 @RachelNotley
 Important, I hope you read your tweets.

I understand how much better it is to use our oil than to import it during the transition to green energy. Canadian oil can also be used for purposes other than energy.
470 2018-12-10 23:10:12 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
471 2018-12-10 23:10:09 Free market conditions? Liberal govt suppression of Canadian oil is not “free market conditions”.  He deserves to be called out for that and so much more for putting Canada last.
472 2018-12-10 23:09:30 If  your definition of "full potential" is giving pipelines as corporate welfare to international oil companies, and selling low-grade bitumen at a significant discount just to keep production figures high, then you have some pretty low standards of potential.

476 2018-12-10 23:08:45 A great tip is to avoid lotion with water in it!! Unless it’s applied a few hours before you leave the house! I’d recommend Decubal intensive repair cream and use some argan oil on your hands over night

The greatest period of innovation was during the great depression. Let the economy do its work. It has done a great job for years.
479 2018-12-10 23:08:27 All those peaks are during oil recessions
480 2018-12-10 23:08:16 Instead of fighting eco-tech and green energy, why don't the oil companies diversify and expand into these markets? Stop denying #ClimateChange and start making money by investing in wind, solar, and other green alternatives.

You can still be greedy assholes. Just eco-assholes.
481 2018-12-10 23:08:11 Didn't he just outscore his closest teammate in NJ by like 30 points or something? Who are the great players he has in NJ these days? Is NJ any closer to a Stanley than Edm? Without looking at their roster, I'd bet he's not in a much better position now than he was with Oil.
482 2018-12-10 23:08:08 It’s hard for me to tell which one is more durable and likely to produce more cash over the next few decades.  I guess I will stay diversified in equal parts gold and oil.
483 2018-12-10 23:08:04 I mean, I get it if someone who isn’t from Texas doesn’t understand how things work here. Long story short, EVERYONE around here works in oil and gas. Plus, Beto received a lot of money from all industries, because he raised record breaking amounts of money.
484 2018-12-10 23:07:58 Most people: “wow that was smooth”
Chlo: “wow that was like riding on a bit of oil that was”
485 2018-12-10 23:07:56 Have made oil pull concoction for BD he’s needed to use it for tooth pain. It really does help prevent infection & help with pain/sensitivity
486 2018-12-10 23:07:34 I've seen this in particular a lot. Software with lots of extra complexity because the book said this is how you so it. 

It also turns some shops off to the useful stuff in the book.  "We did that patterns snake oil. Don't try to sell it around here."
487 2018-12-10 23:07:33 Hi Nathan, oh no! We're sorry for the delay; our team works Mon-Fri & saw your message today! You can apply some baby oil to the skin and wash away the pigments with soap and water (avoiding eyes). We hope this helps & feel free to call 1-800-346-3278 with any more questions!
488 2018-12-10 23:07:18 Qué pasó con standard oil? Porque el estado tuvo que intervenir? No necesariamente los monopolios son culpa de intervención estatal.
489 2018-12-10 23:07:09 You are somewhat correct, Irving refined products make it into Quebec. You do get 37% of your oil from Trump and 11% from algeria which is sooooooooo much better with human rights than Saudi Arabia
490 2018-12-10 23:07:09 Need motor oil for them heels
491 2018-12-10 23:07:08 Drilling for oil
492 2018-12-10 23:07:06 It's easy to see a not too distant future where using oil and gas for energy will be a thing of the past because of falling green energy prices. My point was that Alberta may have some bad years ahead that Equalization will benefit the province. Canada will repay the debt.
493 2018-12-10 23:07:00 PETA is also okay with the palm oil in Oreos and other “accidentally vegan” snacks.
494 2018-12-10 23:06:59 I should’ve just came to get my oil changed tomorrow. This little jiffy lube piked
495 2018-12-10 23:06:45 I use white sugar, olive oil, some essential oils and honey! Easy, clean, cheap 
496 2018-12-10 23:06:16 Always seems to happen to them.
They probably based domestic budgets on higher oil price.
With the lower prices, they have no choice but to keep pumping (generate revenue) in order to satisfy domestic needs and keep market share.
497 2018-12-10 23:06:11 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
498 2018-12-10 23:06:09 Has anyone ever tried Oil Pulling? 

I heard it’s amazing for your oral health & I would love to try it, I’m just not totally sure because I don’t know anyone personally who’s tried it... 
499 2018-12-10 23:06:07 Mad
500 2018-12-10 23:06:07 Had a job interview today and made a joke about the oil field and the guy didn’t find it funny. Oops forgot I’m back in CA with a bunch of hipsters 
501 2018-12-10 23:06:00 Alberta is almost a mono-economy. The day oil is gone, there fuck!
502 2018-12-10 23:05:57 The childish attitude is the one that uses oil products while disparaging them because the are so unaware of the sources. But nice try, your actions support oil products, even if your gaping mouth doesn't.
503 2018-12-10 23:05:53 I would start with a beard oil. If your face is getting red and itchy when you grow a beard, it could use some moisture. Also may want to consider a beard shampoo. The hair on your face has different needs than the hair on your head.
504 2018-12-10 23:05:50 Black and yellow? I think bees are trending....

Consider the golden fields of North Dakota, and the oil there. And likewise consider the tiny skyscrapers of the bees.

511 2018-12-10 23:04:57 Those donations are from employees in oil & gas companies, not from PAC’s. I don’t ever vote based on party line or I guess “team’s”. I’ve done more research than i ever care to admit. After doing the research, my support for Beto just grew. What he did in house to protect -

513 2018-12-10 23:04:52 I stg I cook every night so I'm not a noob, but I'm baking chicken & I guess olive oil got on the bottom of the pan so it is popping and we have a gas stove so I'm preparing for an fire
514 2018-12-10 23:04:45 I would put oil in the EK, drive 30 mins and THEN realize I forgot to put the oil cap back on  so much for all the oil I put in.

Check your wipers
Check your oil 

Lastly let ya car warm up before you go (at least 5 mins)

Be safe my Queens
531 2018-12-10 23:02:35 Oil would be my preferred choice Keith but I’m a bit concerned that in the few areas that the old varnish has ingressed deep into the timber and still some dark spots that won’t be removed it could highlight these. Do you reckon these are cedar?
532 2018-12-10 23:02:28 Well cut off any oil supply to provinces that don’t want it and also make sure any oil related revenues are not shared with those provinces. Let’s see what $2/L or more is like in La Belle Province
533 2018-12-10 23:02:23 He thinks Macron is stupid for raising the oil tax. He has no clue, I told him we'd better be off not talking politics and he agreed. I told him to expect events that are unbelievable in the near future and that I'll be there when he wants to understand and lean on my shoulder.

541 2018-12-10 23:01:17 Let that be your truth. The rest of the world can also decide it doesn’t need the USA that much. Airbus flies just as well in China as Boeing. Nothing wrong with Iranian oil. Let’s see what has happened in a year.

562 2018-12-10 22:59:11 Felony possession of THC makes me wonder if there was oil in a vape or something. As an Atlantan I can say that they are backwards AF when it comes to that. They still struggling to decriminalize smaller amounts of leaves.
563 2018-12-10 22:59:02 おぱよーー！(*´ｪ`*)
564 2018-12-10 22:59:01 If this ain’t the longest oil change I’ve ever seen 
565 2018-12-10 22:58:55 Yes, like science told us we were running out of oil 25-30 years ago.
566 2018-12-10 22:58:49 Heaven forbid we would realize our full potential as a  resource rich country and not import any Saudi oil. Business is run by our regulatory system and our laws. But you cop out and shrug your shoulders. It can not be done therefore it can not be done. Q0h Soh

577 2018-12-10 22:57:38 The point is that the trust fund GE enjoys today come from oil and by his actions he denies the same for others
578 2018-12-10 22:57:34 Didn’t you make your fortune in oil and gas?
579 2018-12-10 22:57:28 As stated by my previous colleagues, these are designed to match the price of crude oil supply and still provide as many reductions and savings to the customer at the pump as much as we can. I hope this has explained your query somewhat! Many thanks - Noor 2/2
580 2018-12-10 22:57:20 Good idea, only tax the oil companies.  No way they'll raise rates to pay for the tax.

584 2018-12-10 22:57:01 Came in for an oil change and theres 3+ things wrong with my cars 
585 2018-12-10 22:56:56 I agree the Federal Gov't wants to shut off oil by 2050, no replacement energy of that magnitude is on the horizon, we could start nuclear now in the Rockies, but the eco terrorists think it's unnatural too. Fusion? Algae? Burn all the forests? What replaces oil?
586 2018-12-10 22:56:46 I have to check my chips too though. On the eastern side of the U.K., a lot of chippies use dripping. On the western half they tend to use vegetable oil.
587 2018-12-10 22:56:41 May God renew your cruse of oil in Jesus name Amen
588 2018-12-10 22:56:18 Trudeau and Morneau intentionally driving Alberta/Sask from confederation. If not intentional, what else? Hard to imagine gov't this incompetent. They kill the O&G industry, close Cold Lake and promise Quebec, who says their oil (but not their $$) isn't socially acceptable.
589 2018-12-10 22:55:49 BC and Quebec are screwing the rest of Canada! Cut their equalization payments, ignore agreements and go for jugular! Can't get blood from a stone or money from  a province that can't get its oil to market!
590 2018-12-10 22:55:43 tea tree oil works wonders
591 2018-12-10 22:55:43 I wish that the price of home heating oil was going down.
592 2018-12-10 22:55:42 I’m afraid he’s right. We only support them so they don’t unite with Russia. We don’t need their oil. We don’t need anybody’s oil.
593 2018-12-10 22:55:40 Me: every Channuka I mean to buy an air fryer, you know that only uses one spoon of oil
Them: But Channuka you are meant to use more oil
Me: No. Air fryer is the Channuka miracle, one spoon of oil lasts for 8 latkes.
Me and them: we laughed and we laughed. Then we ate sufganiyot.
594 2018-12-10 22:55:31 How about killing all oil and gas subsidies and sharing that money out to the people by helping to fund a Universal Basic Income?
595 2018-12-10 22:55:20 See, Coconut Oil Noy is a asshole.  Get out of town Gabe
596 2018-12-10 22:55:10 Basic concept of economics should have washed this ignorance from your type. There are laws for bidding for any item in Nigeria under Procurement Act. So if states want oil well allocations, they could bid as a normal business entity. Stop spewing scummy turd online 
597 2018-12-10 22:55:07 So I started to talk about oil changes and types of oil with a customer and legit after the convo ads for Car oil comes up  should I be freaked out ?! 
598 2018-12-10 22:55:04 No, it was not largely caused by the printing of money, the printing of money FOLLOWED the larger causes of the hyperinflation, you're ignoring the root causes that triggered the beginning of the hyperinflation.  OIL FOR DEBT.
599 2018-12-10 22:54:54 my favorite part about going to get an oil change or really any time going to the mechanics are the men who think I know absolutely nothing :-)
600 2018-12-10 22:54:48 Keep pushing until we get actual justice. No high fives, no deals, no arms sales, no oil from his killers. It’s simple: it’s decent.
601 2018-12-10 22:54:48 How about not contributing to Equalization any more,  and spend the money fitting Solar Panels to EVERY structure in Alberta and sharing the energy  !
Then we could cut off all Oil production and sales to Ontario and Quebec  !

615 2018-12-10 22:53:18 But they have social acceptance for Saudis and their  oil? How hypocritical is that? We need to define what it means to be Canadian, to have nationwide loyalty, but hasn't it always been a problem? Now, it's getting much  worse.

633 2018-12-10 22:51:22 The biggest oil companies are already nationalized. IF you want to use a national company to decrease the Q of C02, you have to either raise the price or just cut people off, both of which are going to have the same impact as a gas tax.

661 2018-12-10 22:48:39 Is it appropriate to use the whole bottle of oil when applying essential oils or no? Asking for a friend.
662 2018-12-10 22:48:21 Why do you call them “forces”, instead of what they are: oil companies. De-growth may be incomprehensible, but destroying oil companies is very comprehensible.
663 2018-12-10 22:48:14 We all pay federal taxes - Alberta happens to have a lot of high wage earners because it’s sitting on oil.  That doesn’t make anyone else lazy.  It does make you arrogant tough.

666 2018-12-10 22:48:04 I love when guys walk into sallys and feel the need to make a joke about needing nail polish or makeup because they’re not secure enough to walk into a store they perceive as only for women, even though they’re purchasing beard oil.
667 2018-12-10 22:47:54 Of course he’s a con man!  How can you even ask that question?  Born to be a snake oil salesman and that’s all.  Nothing else there.
668 2018-12-10 22:47:44 It will take some time for OIL to recover,,, wait for the next inventory report.
669 2018-12-10 22:47:40 Do investors of ‘oil’ hold Shell liable for gains or losses - of course not!  It’s all perspective!
670 2018-12-10 22:47:36 a forensic audit is requested 2gt ansrs to questns tht may b used 2 charge a person for a crime. At present, the only question we av no ansrs 2 is “where is the oil?”.

671 2018-12-10 22:47:28 PDP was in power from 16yrs and he Atiku once served as a vice president, what did the administration during his time do to diversify the economy? If am not mistaken, @atiku owns a oil block too. Here is Buhari trying to diversify the economy & we still cry foul play.....
672 2018-12-10 22:47:24 Again to all you supporters who still dont get it WHO will PAY for the OIL spills. The oil company? Rail company? Pipeline company? Albertans? Quebecers? Or Can Gov? Why is it so hard to say we will pay for any oil spill since we want our hazard goods going through your land.
673 2018-12-10 22:47:19 Halabja had nothing to do with oil or with the West.  It was genocide against the Kurds.  what did the West have to do with what happened in Rwanda?  The West is damned if we do and damned if we don't.
674 2018-12-10 22:47:11 I reccommend for the scalp since that's where you will have live CB1 & 2 receptors. I've seen CBD oil products for hair and I'm like nooo don't put it all over the hair, just the scalp. When I use a CBD oil scalp mask I feel like it evens out the oiliness, plus it feels good
675 2018-12-10 22:47:09 The pipeline will increase production from the oil sands and increase emissions from consumption abroad. It will increase overall emissions, and emissions counted within Canada(all those other than the consumption piece).
676 2018-12-10 22:47:04 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Please explain to your fans why FedX and UPS are declining with the price of oil. Seems counterintuitive

682 2018-12-10 22:46:47 okay, I checked and they are mostly oil, wax and pigment. Dish soap deals with oils, I'm not sure about waxes, I know it can be removed by placing some paper on the stain and then ironing, but it may help pigment set in, but there shoud be some alternative ways
683 2018-12-10 22:46:36 seems like we have the same issues as when oil was a 100+ a barrel. But can we stop saying the Liberals are buying foreign oil from Saudi etc. It's factually incorrect. It's like noone has heard of rainy day funds. How does N Dakota have billions in sunny day cash and SK zilch?
684 2018-12-10 22:46:34 don't see that going well
oil meets water
shouldn't she have a niqab on?
685 2018-12-10 22:46:27 I completely agree. Have been waiting with a loaded cart for the right opportunity....I am certain of oil falls below 50 this week canadian energy will plummet. Better prices to be had. Imho

687 2018-12-10 22:46:22 No one here is advocating for oil cars over electric cars. We're advocating for electric public transportation over electric cars.
688 2018-12-10 22:46:04 They have more ports than Saskatchewan and Alberta combined, plus oil in the south
689 2018-12-10 22:46:01 録るのかぁw
690 2018-12-10 22:45:55 The fear in this sector is beyond a simple fix.  I suspect oil will be in the $40s soon.
691 2018-12-10 22:45:45 Is it weird that I put on body oil/ cologne when I’m finished bathing after I come home from work? I tell my co worker that’s what I is do and nigga say I weird.
692 2018-12-10 22:45:44 That newb is dumber than Schiff!
693 2018-12-10 22:45:44 Yeah, any moments like that where robot characters are clearly seen in pain with leaking oil/blood are likely to cross the line.
694 2018-12-10 22:45:43 Well how about a #CarbonTax on Saudi oil imports? #AskingForAFriend
695 2018-12-10 22:45:43 Never negotiate with terrorists.
696 2018-12-10 22:45:41 Never be honest with a psychiatrist. Made the mistake of saying I've been using CBD oil for my arthritis and now they're taking my ADD medication away, those are the two things that help me most. I want to kill myself #depression #cptsd #Mentalhealth #ADHD
697 2018-12-10 22:45:35 Disagree.

It would make a difference if only rich people were allowed to change oil.
698 2018-12-10 22:45:34 yes!! when i can remember to find my tea tree oil i use it!
699 2018-12-10 22:45:28 You gotta do you, but the phrase "oil money" is absolutely racist when it's used against City. You may mean it a bit different, but you're also presuming to speak for the hearts of plenty of racist fans
700 2018-12-10 22:45:25 No it would not, we would become leaders in wind, water, geothermal, and sun energy. Canada would sell its technology and new made companies to the world as did oil and gas. nice thing about green is we do not have to rely on OPEC to decide our energy costs!
701 2018-12-10 22:45:14 Yes. Same for oil and sugar. They can can stave off proteolysis for gluconeogenesis AA sources during long term fasts.
702 2018-12-10 22:45:04 The question is when shale is going to stop growing its oil output (or even reverse it a bit) ??
703 2018-12-10 22:44:58 My car is threatening me to change its oil... bro ion wanna spend the money
704 2018-12-10 22:44:41 This nigga changing my oil probably about to try and steal my gun...... and what imma do? He got the gun lmfao
705 2018-12-10 22:44:37 Yes, you've said that. It makes no practical difference. Whether you change your oil yourself or pay someone to change your oil, your oil gets changed.
706 2018-12-10 22:44:30 Hey, why don't you start talking about the journos murdered in Mexico, or murdered in Iran? Can't pretend Trump has anything to do with it?
Khashoggi, A PART TIME COLUMNIST, was a Muslim Brotherhood opponent of the Saudis, as well as a friend of OBL.
Live & die by the sword.
707 2018-12-10 22:44:28 I don't think it's *bad* they're making people start to care about where their food comes from but I do think they aren't being wise with demonising palm oil and making everyone think it'll help the world significantly
708 2018-12-10 22:44:27 Is Wilson the one that wears those funky cowboy hats? Yippee Kiyaaa!
709 2018-12-10 22:44:27 Working people are a commodity, like oil . Companies have to pay the market rate , free movement gave them a glut . Company profits does not equal working people’s earnings level, not anywhere in the world .booming companies does not mean booming earnings for working people,
710 2018-12-10 22:44:11 Lrt me @ me Saturday buying $135 of oil painting supplies
711 2018-12-10 22:44:09 You are right. By electing politicians who will put our tax dollars to good use, supporting green technology development and deployment and transitioning from oil to alternatives.
712 2018-12-10 22:44:00 If finding Nemo was real life, they’d never find nemo. They’d just find fish fingers in an oil spill
713 2018-12-10 22:43:43 Steal his car and get him an oil change in 2019
714 2018-12-10 22:43:39 SPEEDMASTER OILのステッカーが全然ヒットしなくて悲しい…
715 2018-12-10 22:43:39 腐っちゃったか？と恐々注いだ牛乳がとても美味しかったから、もう少し生きてていいかもしれないと思いました。
716 2018-12-10 22:43:36 I lived in Norway.  Population less than 5 million.  Norway gets its money from oil.  The cost to live there is high.  It’s not what everyone makes it out to be.  People live very simply in comparison to the United States.
717 2018-12-10 22:43:31 Russia made a deal with OPEC to slash oil production.
Now this. 
Expect more surprises from Russia in the coming weeks.
718 2018-12-10 22:43:24 Fail
719 2018-12-10 22:43:09 Yeah exactly. I started reading up on Peak Oil not long after and thought it would be far more immediate than climate change impacts. Of course it turns out fossil fuels are probably centuries from peaking.
720 2018-12-10 22:42:58 Use baby oil, conditioner or coconut oil instead of shaving cream.
721 2018-12-10 22:42:44 I do not talk to the psycho anymore but his point was that they died because of oil. We would not have invaded without the oil but we invade all the time and there is no oil. Haiti, Somalia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Panama etc etc.
722 2018-12-10 22:42:38 im afraid this is a one of a kind reproduction... i may know how to use oil paints, but i dont like them and i wouldnt feel right making reproductions of my reproduction
723 2018-12-10 22:42:36 If the Fed goes neutral after December rate hike, which I believe they will, $gold price will depend on inflation.  Price of oil is driving the bus.
724 2018-12-10 22:42:36 Apologies in advance to any unfortunate colleagues who bump into me tomorrow smelling like I’ve bathed in Olbas Oil - currently going to sleep with reems of toilet roll doused in the stuff stuffed in my pillow case to help alleviate my horrendous cold 
725 2018-12-10 22:42:35 Listening now, great one. 
Footnote to the Kuwaiti oil fires - I believe the boots & coots cleanup crew had illness and mortality rates on par with the Chernobyl crew (can’t find the figures just now)
726 2018-12-10 22:42:31 Naive, socialism has nothing to do with it. Ever since Hugo Chavez nationalised their oil and chased US and British coys out if Venezuela in 1999, it's been loads and loads of economic sanctions. Blame imperialism/capitalism
727 2018-12-10 22:42:27 My oil pen died & I can’t find the charger and I’m about to take a final I’m stressed lmao
728 2018-12-10 22:42:21 I’ve been saying this and warning friends and family to prepare for over a year, likely close to 2. In the Seattle area housing prices have surpassed bubble territory. It’s got to pop at some point. Housing prices and fuel/oil prices are always good (bad) indicators.
729 2018-12-10 22:42:13 I reccommend CBD oil for the scalp, there are no live CB1 & 2 receptors in the hair shaft, so the CBD has nowhere to go :) 

Castor oil is also really good for hair, and it is much more affordable 
730 2018-12-10 22:42:13 everytime i come get a oil change they try ti get me to buy extra shit 
731 2018-12-10 22:41:49 Who do you think you might go with to do your oil analysis?
732 2018-12-10 22:41:47 I'm sitting with 75% oil...so...

734 2018-12-10 22:41:45 He is a coward, though.
735 2018-12-10 22:41:27 Even though I walk through the valley of  the shadow of death, I will  fear no evil,
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me
in  the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
736 2018-12-10 22:41:22 Have been googling. Someone on Mumsnet says the blue ones had orange oil in them.

That’s all the evidence I need.

738 2018-12-10 22:41:20 I’m a considerate man. 

If there is a smear of head oil on a train window I rest my head in it instead of leaning against another spot and creating another patch of head oil.

739 2018-12-10 22:41:15 Agora na Melody 94.1: MIDNIGHT OIL - BEDS ARE BURNING
740 2018-12-10 22:41:10 After a devasting UN report making it clear the entire human race is going to be dealing with global, health, environmental & economic crisis starting now, the US is siding against the rest of the world with 2 criminal autocrats who's entire financial systems are based on oil.
741 2018-12-10 22:40:56 Just imagine what condition Norway financial situation would be if they had had to hand over $250B to equalization plus had to sell their oil for $12 barrel because they couldn't access world markets.
742 2018-12-10 22:40:35 AOC is so ignorant it’s beyond words! First, to the woman who spread the lies they were LIES! What POTUS said to the grieving family was said with compassion and it was true! General Kelly owes no one an apology! But hey NANCY you better reign in your girl she is out of control!
743 2018-12-10 22:40:35 Tree Hut sugar scrubs.  They come in a variety of scents and only cost about $6.00.  They are juicy with a lot of oil in them.

745 2018-12-10 22:40:30 Also also most renewable energy sources can't scale fast enough for 2nd/3rd world countries (ones that produce the majority of emissions), so oil production is best for them
746 2018-12-10 22:40:29 MSMs conceal another TRUMP victory - USA became net exporter of crude oil by over 200,000 barrels per day!! MAGA!!

753 2018-12-10 22:40:15 Why store it, if.there is nothing wrong with it? 
Oil is more use as plastic rather than fuel.

 Lead in gas/petrol? True story. 

 I bet you still believe in santa, your that gullible. Are you a man of faith ?
754 2018-12-10 22:40:05 My rats have made me to things medically I never thought I would have to do...shove medication down their throats, apply topical mite meds, rub coconut oil on their skin to heal it, and now flush out a burst abcess with saline solution until it heals. Interesting experiences

756 2018-12-10 22:40:05 My neighbors gonna pay me to change his cars oil. Havent even started school and the career's starting
757 2018-12-10 22:39:52 Havent really being paying attention to the political side as of yet .. 
Just keep seeing alot of movement occurring on LNA behalf ..  redeployment of troops
Possible sightings of movement of enemy convoys .. seems like another battle for Oil Cresent is about to commence
758 2018-12-10 22:39:47 I really don’t feel like changing this oil in the cold.
759 2018-12-10 22:39:45 What I want: mixed peanut butter
What I get: peanut oil all over the kitchen
What I don't do: learn from my mistakes
760 2018-12-10 22:39:44 Is this really what our Harvard trained Keynesian economist at the Federal Reserve have been reduced to? Fixing the stock market by Phoning a Friend at the Swiss National Bank to buy $APPL? Attacking oil prices w HFT to ease inflation? At what point do you say we have no answers?

764 2018-12-10 22:39:25 Just found out Lavender oil helps with hair loss!  I know what I’m adding to my shampoo 
765 2018-12-10 22:39:12 Absolutely! And it gets even more out of whack when you start accounting for all of the subsidies in the form of military action in the middle east to protect oil reserves. I do think nuclear is probably a good route to take, but it needs to be done responsibly.
766 2018-12-10 22:39:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i lost acnl again beans weed the fuck.

768 2018-12-10 22:39:05 @CTV_PowerPlay Quebec's finance minister must be referring to Enbridge pipeline 9
 built in the 70's to ship oil  from their refineries eastward from Montreal to Sarnia but now ships foreign oil westward from Sarnia  to Quebec refineries.
769 2018-12-10 22:39:05 True but remember that the ongoing investigations center around the oil loses which will undoubtedly lead to the fact that the tanks have leaks. 
No further investigation is being conducted re: in-house activities which is where the real action is.
770 2018-12-10 22:38:57 Those poor oil drillers on Lake Maracaibo... 
771 2018-12-10 22:38:49 lol, that's terrible. 
Maybe it's not concentrated enough so you have to take in too much grape seed oil to get the medicine you need. I only use a couple drops under my tongue, so it's not a huge deal.
772 2018-12-10 22:38:47 Tell her to give C.B.D oil a go Rita!! It's been known to reverse stage four cancer!! Google it and check it out!

How many more ‘journos’ can @PnPCBC stack on their show, how about more coverage re Saudi oil lol. CTV @ least balances coverage
774 2018-12-10 22:38:38 You can send your details to any of the two numbers on the tweet
775 2018-12-10 22:38:36 Did you toss a coin when you decide where to spud, correct? 
776 2018-12-10 22:38:36 What about the 46 Christmas,s and numerous recessions, and bankers crash , the steel, coal, fishing, dockers, car, Water, Rail, power, oil, industries & associated suppliers , housing , pubs, clubs, shops, etc, suffered!
777 2018-12-10 22:38:34 <Yawn> you’re getting boring. Be smart, witty, or angry. Otherwise, I got places to be
778 2018-12-10 22:38:33 ゴミか。
779 2018-12-10 22:38:20 Yup! I guess all the newer cars need that type of oil.
780 2018-12-10 22:38:20 AND rightfully so! Even gold star family members don’t get a pass for outright lying! All he had to do was apologize!
781 2018-12-10 22:38:19 Says the person with a profile that supports Trump who’s pocket is lined by SA. Our govt had spoken out against SA, hence their withdrawal of their diplomats and foreign students. US had done nothing. Canada doesn’t import SA oil, Irving Oil does. Neocon supporter.
782 2018-12-10 22:37:58 @jeancase ...It is a fund raising lie. 1.5 trillion gallons yearly world total oil production. 1.1 trillion gallons is a cubic mile. Compared to forest fires & volcanoes, oil is a minor pollutant. Also  propaganda in Mars TV show. Loony left never gives up. I deserve better !
783 2018-12-10 22:37:57 Sure - and they are currently dealing with that legally. But that doesn't change the current issue - the quantity of oil used has to go down. And that means that working people are going to either face higher gas prices or less overall availability. There's no getting around that
784 2018-12-10 22:37:45 Nigeria was doing quite fine before the discovery of crude oil in 1956 coz the country saw the need for agriculture but then successive govts came in and abandoned agriculture and depended solely on oil even when they had been warned that very soon there'll be a decline........
785 2018-12-10 22:37:44 I feel like since it an oil it could remove makeup ?
786 2018-12-10 22:37:42 After a devasting UN report making it clear the entire human race is going to be dealing with global, health, environmental & economic crisis starting now, the US is siding against the rest of the world with 2 criminal autocrats who's entire financial systems are based on oil.

790 2018-12-10 22:37:08 Went to the GM dealership today to get the oil changed.  They are so out of business if they don't want my engine.  Not one person there understood what I was talking about.  Like a veil over their eyes.  Sad.  Too bad   Can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink.

793 2018-12-10 22:36:57 Oil is big money regardless of the consequences. These athiest run powers will cause serious issues for future generations.
794 2018-12-10 22:36:55 No one proposes the gov't making deals with anyone. The gov't is there to ensure a level playing field for everyone. Monopolies are not state creations. Standard Oil was not a state creation. It was a monopoly and it was the essence of the anti-monopoly laws.
795 2018-12-10 22:36:40 I HAVE OIL
796 2018-12-10 22:36:37 There's always work as a gigolo.
797 2018-12-10 22:36:37 Yea thats whats I been hearing, On a house shot i
I play the middle part in the part of the Lane where the oil is heavier. Since moving in my score have been higher versus me playing deeper.
798 2018-12-10 22:36:37 And with the volitional intent to shut off oil from Alberta, The Federal Gov't owns the existing TransMountain and can stop oil flow anytime it wants. In fact they would now blame an oil spill or damage to the failure of technology, not themselves.
799 2018-12-10 22:36:31 You missed his earlier tweets where he asserted Mr. O'Rourke was on the take from Oil and Gas industries.  @davidsirota has a definite agenda and it is dangerous.
800 2018-12-10 22:36:26 Sustainable palm oil is not sustainable, is not ethical and is not even needed in our food chain .! The plantations should be destroyed and rewilded imho
801 2018-12-10 22:36:09 If you think that's what caused their downfall while sitting on a massive oil reserve, you're delusional or cherry picking your lies to make an idiotic point.

812 2018-12-10 22:34:55 Since Democrats are once again taking oil money and clearly serve that industry just as their GOP counterparts do,  they are fair game.
813 2018-12-10 22:34:52 According to your logic, Alberta and Michigan have highly questionable human rights policies, because in case you were unaware, that is where QC refineries buy their crude from.

If you have issues with Saudi oil, take it up with Irving, who runs the NB Saint John refinery. Mkay?
814 2018-12-10 22:34:35 Odd, you didn’t seem to give a shit about Gold Star families when Trump was disparaging  Mr. Kahn’s family.

827 2018-12-10 22:33:47 Gotta treat that question like Black Bush did about oil.
828 2018-12-10 22:33:37 I have always felt that mainland USA and the US government only sees Alaska as a commodity, not much else.  It seems like they do nothing for the people and only care that the oil flows.  Join Canada and be appreciated for your people, land and way of life rather than your oil.
829 2018-12-10 22:33:30 best decision i’ve made is keeping my zen essential oil in my car and putting it on my air vents , it saves lives i promise 
830 2018-12-10 22:33:29 Hard to understand your claim here. Of course reducing plantation expansion or even in the long term the total amount of land under plantations would be best for forests. Reducing demand for palm oil is part of that. Certification schemes historically have not done much
831 2018-12-10 22:33:22 routine fuel burning by oil refineries it’s not actually a fire or anything
832 2018-12-10 22:33:19 And islamophobes. But either way, conservatives only care about oil and money...
833 2018-12-10 22:32:57 So i had this burn scar on my leg and i put some bio oil on it and it dissapeared in seconds
834 2018-12-10 22:32:38 I loved it. I was crying while waiting to get our truck a oil change.  I was getting looks but I don't care. A great episode.
835 2018-12-10 22:32:30 I'm Italian so you got me at the prosciutto and mozzarella and olive oil
836 2018-12-10 22:32:29 Just got an oil change car wash and air in the tires
837 2018-12-10 22:32:26 omg I'm so sorry for you use a lot of conditioner and hair oil....
838 2018-12-10 22:32:21 So I’m getting an oil change and for some reason I knew the dude was trying to talk to me.. why he ask for my snap and gave me a lil discount 
839 2018-12-10 22:32:21 1. Russia was not only running his campaign, they hand-picked his VP and installed at least one of his cabinet members.  Looking at you rExxon Tillerson.  Exxon wanted their trillion dollar oil deal with Russia back on track and Russia wanted Rex to gut the State Department...
840 2018-12-10 22:32:20 Good, while you are at it don't have any kids & produce any more consumers of oil products. Throw away any technology produced by oil products, if you really don't support oil. Maybe you can join the Amish!
841 2018-12-10 22:32:17 Heaven forbid you look up that Saudi oil is going to NB, not QC.  But hey, as long as you are happy using nationalism, xenophobia, and basic lack-of-education on the oil market to promote something easily discredited as false, right? #cdnpoli #nbpoli
842 2018-12-10 22:32:11 Thanks for reaching out, Carrie! In our restaurants, French fries are cooked in vegetable oil. For flavor, our French fry suppliers in the U.S. also use a small amount of beef flavoring during the par-frying process at the plant.
843 2018-12-10 22:32:06 Harriet nd Zweli? I dont think so. That's like Harriet nd Jerry Maake, oil nd water. Besides how would a mother not know her daugther  vis-a-vis  Nomonde's mother died.
844 2018-12-10 22:31:57 He is a coward.
845 2018-12-10 22:31:57 Agreed-There will be a strategic angle. It'll be a resource like oil, people will fight over it and the left will start quoting all of my tweets saying it is ugly and we have to stop with RE because it causes wars and you have to mine it causing ecological damage to virtue signal
846 2018-12-10 22:31:56 I didn't criticize you, those are all things that you put on Twitter about yourself. That's kind of the butt of the joke. I don't know if you understand idioms though.
847 2018-12-10 22:31:54 Reminds me of a ski trip when someone misread the pepper measurement as 3T, not 3t. That's 3x. We ate it, because we like crying when we eat, but we froze because we had to  open the windows so we could breathe - when that much crushed red pepper hit hot oil it was like mace. 1/
848 2018-12-10 22:31:54 I came to this place for an oil change & they damn near tryna have me leave with a new car huh

851 2018-12-10 22:31:44 That includes oil, genius.
852 2018-12-10 22:31:39 True story! 
Also a #CHEESEFACT,Some cheeses, like pecorino romano or parmigiano reggiano have high amounts of oil and/or salt that can upset a weak stomach, which is often confused as a lactose reaction.
853 2018-12-10 22:31:39 Greenpeace is now making deals with the Palm Oil Devil Wilmar & is now in effect endorsing Wilmar.

A leopard doesn’t change its spots. 

I thought Greenpeace had a commitment to climate change? They should be demanding clearing of palm oil & reforestation of rainforests. C Sinks

855 2018-12-10 22:31:26 Santos Ltd (#ASX: $STO) and Woodside Petroleum Limited (ASX: $WPL) shares will be on watch on Tuesday after oil prices gave back their recent gains. The Brent crude oil price dropped 2.9% to US$59.90 a barrel. Concerns over global demand growth weighed on prices on Monday.

857 2018-12-10 22:31:20 @jeancase Thank you for wanting me back, with a $15 offer. The reason after about 40 years is the sea level rise,hate oil and y'all know best. Since 1890 one degree of temperature increase. How many 1000 years to raise sea level 2 feet. If you expose the lie I'd come back.......
858 2018-12-10 22:31:17 Who? I want to say he was a moustache oil salesman?

aka my testosterone is in cottonseed oil and that’s why i want to die so bad when i give myself my shot
862 2018-12-10 22:31:00 if it’s not gas, it’s air in my tires, then it needs an oil change, oh and don’t forget ab the windshield wiper fluid

869 2018-12-10 22:30:12 Proper thought aliens were on the way and I could save the world like will smith and Jeff goldblum but it was just “routine burning” of a fucking oil refinery 
870 2018-12-10 22:30:07 I need to wash my hair tonight because it’s breaking out my face  too much damn oil
871 2018-12-10 22:30:04 idk why I thought putting CBD oil in my chai latte would be a good idea

873 2018-12-10 22:29:53 This olive oil one 
874 2018-12-10 22:29:50 Because of the idiot Trump who is romantically talking down oil.
And #SHALE who will not stop overproducing!!
875 2018-12-10 22:29:45 1) Provinces don't import oil, companies do.
2) Oil refineries in QC get the majority of their crude from Alberta via Enbridge
3) The only refinery dependant on Saudi oil is New Brunswick's Irving facility.
4) Irving's President intends to order Saudi oil even with a pipeline.
876 2018-12-10 22:29:42 So Comrade Trumps,Master Putin, striking a deal with Venezuela to take over the oil production does not concern any of Comrade Trump’s supporters?

879 2018-12-10 22:29:29 Learn how to make basic bread 500g bread flour, 7g easy yeast, 10g salt, 20ml sunflower oil and 300ml warm water. From that you can make pizza, pretzels, bagels, breadsticks. And that’s just one basic dough. Good luck x
880 2018-12-10 22:29:24 We know gas does not work we know oil coal and nuclear does not work look at Chernobyl and fukashema (pardon the spelling) time for a major change
881 2018-12-10 22:29:22 I wash it and put coconut oil
882 2018-12-10 22:28:52 @MichelleRempel have you, or any conservative MP, asked the PM what his intentions were whe he told Doug Ford “if Ontario doesn’t pay carbon tax then Alberta’s oil sands will have to be shut down”?
883 2018-12-10 22:28:43 But if everyone is expecting it to slide, wouldn't that currently  be priced in and potentially not sliding? Case in point.. gulf war when everyone thought it will protracted and oil prices will sky rocket but opposite happened
884 2018-12-10 22:28:42 I was looking through oil and gas stocks and only COG had a decent looking chart.
885 2018-12-10 22:28:34 how about his persecution of Saskatchewan Oil & Gas.
Jagmeet Singh is a disgrace to the NDP and the reason I quit my membership.
For his pro terrorist policies too and failure to renounce Air India mastermind.

886 2018-12-10 22:28:29 That's one of the areas where cats' scent glands are located. She may have marked an area that irritated the glands or picked up an irritatant with her paws and scratched it into her skin.. If you put anything on try to use coconut oil, just a bit. Hope she feels better!
887 2018-12-10 22:28:16 There is everything wrong with that tweet, oil and gas is still involved in producing hydro, not to mention the environmental effects of that means of production, his moral superiority is laughable
888 2018-12-10 22:28:15 Wow, you honestly think baseless criticism from a twitter random, nobody accomplishes anything other advertising your own insecurities what’s next? Maybe you could tweet me some flaccid threats?
889 2018-12-10 22:28:03 I like my homemade body scrub made of coffee grounds, vitamin e oil, avocado oil and coconut oil 
890 2018-12-10 22:28:02 So you will trust the opinon from an oil companys who once used to put lead in petrol and  hid the  effects to human health. 
They knew it was posining people but didn't want to clean up. 
But the you don't want to believe those hippy greens. 
There molybdenum in engine oil.
891 2018-12-10 22:27:55 Candice, have you, or any conservative MP, asked the PM what his intentions were whe he told Doug Ford “if Ontario doesn’t pay carbon tax then Alberta’s oil sands will have to be shut down”?
892 2018-12-10 22:27:52 Oh hey. Just some of the world's biggest oil producers. Nothing to see here.
893 2018-12-10 22:27:32 Will true but for me that oil loss issue is most important
894 2018-12-10 22:27:27 Norway has oil and higher taxes than Quebec and they do fine.  Denmark too.  That old line is pretty tired.
895 2018-12-10 22:27:25 No. Working at CNN does that to you
896 2018-12-10 22:27:15 You’re pissed off at Alberta oil people but apparently have no issues buying oil from countries with highly questionable human rights policies because they’re lucky enough to live on a oil patch? Mmmkay...
897 2018-12-10 22:27:10 The biggest lie Nigerians believe is that the state is wealthy; the only issue we have is that our rulers are squandering the funds.

If we only know that we are not a rich country as per our earnings maybe we will start focusing on other aspect of the economy apart from oil
898 2018-12-10 22:27:08 Who are they? And the should oil her ass yo
899 2018-12-10 22:26:57 Nigeria has oil & uranium, but will likely find it cheaper to develop with coal, too, saving those resources for export for cash.
900 2018-12-10 22:26:53 NIMBYism at the insanity level. They consume oil from Nigeria, Kazakhstan & other dubious countries. #Quebec
901 2018-12-10 22:26:52 I make edibles for different family members to help deal with different ailments sorry I'm not selling the oil nor do I have edibles for sale
902 2018-12-10 22:26:52 sometimes if you’re out of oil blotting sheets u can use a toilet seat cover. i’m just saying
903 2018-12-10 22:26:47 ante la duda: oil on canvas, always
904 2018-12-10 22:26:42 I've been getting complemented by women on how good I smell. Which feels great of course, but kinda crazy, I don't even own cologne! Gotta be the hair oil 
905 2018-12-10 22:26:35 My oh My.. now we have Mayawati taking a stand for this. What next- Rabri devi discourse on crude oil prices And its impact on the Indian rupee
906 2018-12-10 22:26:29 If I could take apart every piece of my body and perform maintenance, that'd be great. Massage out these kinks, oil my joints, align my spine, squeegee my tendons, polish my brain 
907 2018-12-10 22:26:25 Bought a really mediocre bottle of olive oil. Feels bad
908 2018-12-10 22:26:22 I think she just sees some line in a random article and uses it in the most ridiculous way possible.  Next week “The key to living a long life is to change your oil every 3,000 miles.  I will propose to have Medicare cover all oil changes and a coolant flush every two years.”
909 2018-12-10 22:26:20 i STILL can’t find the stick to check the oil in my new car, but THANK GOD I can calculate the quarterly breakeven revenue in units given an ROS% target with a negative contribution margin.
910 2018-12-10 22:26:20 The forensic audit covers oil losses only.
No in-house audit pending the outcome of the #PetrojamReport
911 2018-12-10 22:26:18 must choose a side? like they didnt already? 

Ok, you went with Oil Money, but we'll let you choose a side again. 
Ok, you went with Oil Money, bu-

looks like they dont actually have to help anybody, they just have to be Blue
912 2018-12-10 22:26:14 Well if oil is socially unacceptable  they wouldn't mind giving back the equalization  payments to Alberta, to keep accepting is socially wrong.
913 2018-12-10 22:26:09 tea tree oil works
914 2018-12-10 22:26:02 漏らして大泣きしてる娘をトイレに連れてって、服を脱がせて濡れたとこ拭いて、新しいの着せて泣き止むまで宥めて、落ち着いた娘を待たせて濡れた服と放置されたシーツを手洗いして、洗濯まわしてトイレ掃除、終わるまで30分。この間夫は無視して寝てた。
ちなみに夫は休日。私は仕事。
915 2018-12-10 22:25:59 Use CBD oil!!!! Better results, and way less $$$
916 2018-12-10 22:25:56 Why is #pnpcbc not challenging the Alta finance minister about climate change and how "getting oil to market" will contribute to the end of the human species and that we have just over a decade to respond.
917 2018-12-10 22:25:53 Where is Alex’s olbas oil when I need it
918 2018-12-10 22:25:49 I need some CBD oil cause this depression and anxiety is mad real rn, a fucking limpia, Pablo santo and sage. All these mala vibras need to go away!!!!!
919 2018-12-10 22:25:48 5 minute oil change. Quick easy and affordable. Also you don’t have to get out the car lol
920 2018-12-10 22:25:46 Agree, Alberta has nothing to give, its time for Quebec to bail out Alberta. Is that asking too much? Quebec while enjoying their Venezualen oil should be cut off from all Canadian benefits and pay 10 times the carbon tax than rest of Canada.
921 2018-12-10 22:25:37 The workers at this Jiffy Lube all seem super happy and friendly with each other. I’ve never seen so much jovial team work at an oil change place.
922 2018-12-10 22:25:30 I’d hate to share the unethical oil money from AB with PQ (such a pious province), so why don’t we just subtract any oil and gas revenues from the equalization formula since they oppose it so?
923 2018-12-10 22:25:28 いえいえ、行けなかったお気持ちの方が辛いと思うので、
924 2018-12-10 22:25:00 LOL.  I am guessing it means that in the aftermath of Liberal anihilated manufacturing and oil jobs, the Liberals envision Canada as a sort of Cancun/Hawaii tourism dominated economy? We will all work at resorts (instead of just Truedope)?
925 2018-12-10 22:24:58 I wnt 2 count dis morni like am flipping bible pages... OIL dey head..

931 2018-12-10 22:24:36 U.S. Oil Production Reaches Record High: U.S. oil production was estimated at 11.7 million barrels… @environmentguru
932 2018-12-10 22:24:35 60,000 Liters of Oil Spills From Pipeline Into Brazilian Bay: About 60,000 liters (15,850 gallons… @environmentguru
933 2018-12-10 22:24:20 Did you know...the powers that be...oil&has companies with collusion of Government, had technology at least by the 1970's, that allowed for tremendously improved mileage for gas & jet fuel, and they choose to bury it.  Than means of you drive or fly, fuel cost you too much.
934 2018-12-10 22:24:12 I found I was getting too many calories from fat & simple carbs. I cut right down on cooking oil, white pasta & eating toast before bed! Still had wholemeal bread, my Friday takeaway & chips occasionally, so I didn't feel at all deprived!
935 2018-12-10 22:23:55 Oil

937 2018-12-10 22:23:51 This dude saw a marketing blog post mentioning "snake oil" as a metaphor for fake remedies and popped into the comments trying to sell actual snake oil.....
938 2018-12-10 22:23:51 But we’ll still buy your oil regardless.
939 2018-12-10 22:23:51 Wait a second, are you trying to tell me that in order to prevent some of the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we might have to do something besides send angry tweets at oil corporations?
940 2018-12-10 22:23:36 Yeah alright baby oil crocodile face
941 2018-12-10 22:23:29 You're *
942 2018-12-10 22:23:23 Burning oil lanterns hung outside every building and tall lamp posts marked every corner. Still more hung from cords across the streets, and every horse or carriage that passed had yet another swaying from a pole. It was more light than I had seen in decades #lineoftheday
943 2018-12-10 22:23:12 If Hydro is included in Equalization as a natural resource, then so too must all other forms of power generation. This would mean even less money for Alberta at the end of the day, since oil/gas would be calculated twice as a result, first as crude product, then as electricity.
944 2018-12-10 22:22:50 Axis of Oil.
945 2018-12-10 22:22:45 Gonna have to start buying oil wholesale.
946 2018-12-10 22:22:43 Come with me to see Monster Jam 2019 in Lucas Oil so I know its real
947 2018-12-10 22:22:40 Lol at the fact I have to pay car ins, car payment, new tabs and new tires and oil change ALL this month..

First of all how the fuck can I afford to have a car 
948 2018-12-10 22:22:29 You live off welfare from Alberta and buy oil from a terrorist sponsoring dictatorship. If you were honest and had any integrity you would admit you oppose pipelines because hate Alberta
949 2018-12-10 22:22:27 But you know, you KNOW, that wind and solar are not the answer. Too many people on the AGW side where scientist hats are saying it and it is becoming a chorus based on my little research. So it is nuclear with small bits of RW where it works OK or oil and coal.
950 2018-12-10 22:22:26 how did the baby oil work out?
951 2018-12-10 22:22:25 Lmao you mean the military that goes to shoot poor brown people and steal oil?
952 2018-12-10 22:22:25 Trump has been a con man/snake oil salesman from the beginning. He defines con man.
953 2018-12-10 22:22:25 i’m over here drowning my life in coconut oil and doing some self care and you should too
954 2018-12-10 22:22:24 Had a long ass day so far I’ll wait til tomorrow morning to get a oil change
955 2018-12-10 22:22:21 I probably wouldn't dare using oil
A very low practical suggestion; but have you tried to just clean the computer and dust it off with a soft brush? That helped me once (with the ordinary fan though)
956 2018-12-10 22:22:13 Gonna get mighty cold without oil. Long walk to warmth without oil. Of course lots of unemployment. Plus side about no oil is the main terrorist breeding grounds will suffer the most.
957 2018-12-10 22:22:13 Butter! But bake a lot with coconut oil.
958 2018-12-10 22:22:10 i lost a little bottle of rose oil in my room and i’m going crazy. i’ve been trying to sniff it out like a dog
959 2018-12-10 22:22:09 My grandson can't seem to find a job, outside of working at Wendy's or footlocker...why is that? He's just starting out in life and he wants to make money but he wants to be able to support himself, his grandpa worked on oil rigs I hope he can too
960 2018-12-10 22:22:05 We are still on oil. Gone from 3200ltrs a yr 15 yrs ago to around 800 last yr.  The battery is wited so in a powercut,  the boiker still works. An air source heat pump would kill the battery so we have heating and lighting in outages and zombie apocalypses
961 2018-12-10 22:22:02 Essential oils people terrify me. Y’all expect me to believe this blend of oil is supposed to pay off my student loan debt?
962 2018-12-10 22:21:57 Justin Trudeau doesn’t import any oil from Saudi Arabia.  For crying out loud, this kind of misinformation has got to stop.  NOW.

965 2018-12-10 22:21:46 When you look at what Quebec will receive in equalization payments as compared to the rest of the provinces you will be disgusted! Especially when they will not help Ab. get our Oil to market! #cdpol #Ableg
966 2018-12-10 22:21:27 I can only pray that our loving heavenly Father comforts you at this difficult time Doreen. May He grant you beauty for ashes. The oil of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness in Jesus Mighty Name.  GBU & yours Doreen
967 2018-12-10 22:21:26 朝方寝ぼけておしっこもらした娘を「おしっこ漏らした」だけ言って濡れたシーツ剥がして放置→そのまま寝る夫。いくら娘と遊んだり保育園朝送ったりしてても、肝心な時こういう態度だから私はいつまでも夫への怒りをなくせないんだな。
968 2018-12-10 22:21:17 Private investment is high in the oil patch now right? But hasn't translated into private investment in communities because the state has failed to invest in ports, roads, housing, community infrastructure, courts etc. That's what attracts private investment & keeps people here.
969 2018-12-10 22:21:09 Tosin kaaan da TL eyan laaaamu, o je lowa boyfriend ti yooo ma oil Boris e, u will have less energy to be here 
970 2018-12-10 22:20:50 Hope there's oil
971 2018-12-10 22:20:42 Private profits but public risks. Lets not even raise the issue of who will pay the tab for the environmental clean up of the oil sands
972 2018-12-10 22:20:39 My oil change is 90$... what??
973 2018-12-10 22:20:32 Canada is the #4 producer of oil
974 2018-12-10 22:20:27 Zain really blessed me with oil and a dad pen bless my Muslim brother
975 2018-12-10 22:20:22 The record short selling streak for oil coming to an end. Money managers raised bets against crude before opec meeting. They will start covering new positions soon. Too risky keeping open. #wti
976 2018-12-10 22:20:15 Thanks. I really don't understand the ditching of "melts" like Floating Island. They are great for elderly folk who want soft skin. The oil melts make the tub too slick for them. Lots of your Lushies are getting up in age.
977 2018-12-10 22:20:15 Imagine being in a life situation that leads you to participate in a boycott in support of the oil industry.
978 2018-12-10 22:20:15 Get y’all oil changed before y’all engines lock up

985 2018-12-10 22:19:20 Thanks, just a rough guide is exactly what I needed. Also on oil so suffering the increase in cost. Out of budget right now but something we can work towards
986 2018-12-10 22:19:14 Oil / commodity are the main bad inflation driver.
lower Oil / commodity will be deflationary like in 2015 2016 and will push the curve lower FED a no choice but to fallow down or huge revert curve

989 2018-12-10 22:18:51 There's something soothing about burning the midnight oil tonight. Not sure what it is, but I'm enjoying work at this time.
990 2018-12-10 22:18:51 If Birch could quit trying to kick the coconut oil off my head, that’d be great. He’s obsessed.
991 2018-12-10 22:18:50 No surprise major oil producers US, Kuwait,Russia,& Saudi Arabia refuse 2 endorse climate change report...what will they do w/all that $$$ from oil sales when the planets woes become even more catastrophic?
992 2018-12-10 22:18:43 Your trying sooo hard. It’s adorable.. and sad. Go ahead give it another try 
993 2018-12-10 22:18:34 if DOJ won in 1953, we might have significantly less concentration in the financial sector. 

Goldman is undeniably a contender for Standard Oil equivalence.
994 2018-12-10 22:18:28 Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in a tweet he had discussed the state of the oil market with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
995 2018-12-10 22:18:20 same behaviour using olive oil mill wastes.. even better results when zeolite occurs in natural mixtures with other absorbents..
996 2018-12-10 22:18:16 real talk tho my least favorite thing about you is you throw stuff in the oil and that is a safety hazard
997 2018-12-10 22:18:13 Is This You ?  Are You in Military in Turkey ? Always Liked Turkish Oil Wrestling , Cute Turk.
998 2018-12-10 22:18:01 Put the oven on at 200 degrees, brush with olive oil and salt, cook for 20 minutes then turn. For medium-rare Brexit take out at 15.

1000 2018-12-10 22:17:51 But sadly President buhari ND his team are berifit of economic idea and so they blame the fall of oil price. Financial institutions like the IMF, World Bank would willing borrow Nigeria $200Bil to diversify the counties economy if they present a workable & Profitable blueprint
1001 2018-12-10 22:17:50 I've said all along their plan is to crash out. They'll renage on the back stop, force Europe to put a border in Ireland and then try to blame them for the hard border. They'll use the Spreme court to try and tie #Scotland in the union legally until the oil is finished. #indyref2

1005 2018-12-10 22:17:41 Yet governments are still grabbing the quick buck and still the national debt is continuing to rise , we have been miss managed , Aberdeen thrived in the seventies and eighties because of oil companies , not government
1006 2018-12-10 22:17:38 I think it's important to note the block on "welcomes" making the language "notes" instead was done by four countries, all amongst the top oil producers.

(I've been much more disturbed personally at how integrated fossil fuel companies are in COP24, per the hashtag. )
1007 2018-12-10 22:17:37 Tfw you get your oil changed and see that the oil guy is hot and you look like trash.

1015 2018-12-10 22:16:33 Either way, burning oil and breathing it causes ill heath. CO2 above a certain level becomes toxic as well.

1024 2018-12-10 22:15:44 The current formula for equalization was literally set up by Albertans. They can't foresee a world where oil is worth nothing and fresh water is worth everything, very shortsighted.
1025 2018-12-10 22:15:39 I'am a farm boy I enjoy the nature as much if not more, as well 25 years in the oil patch I see what goes on and i know how much we are impacting the Earth we just do not see it as much here because Canada has everything with a small population to land size.
1026 2018-12-10 22:15:36 no I'm afraid it hit the supermarkets before I discovered it, but those were the days when we bought olive oil in the chemist. Product placement swap :-)
1027 2018-12-10 22:15:34 Give me a break. The Saudi oil thing is a weak ploy. I have more in common with the Saudis than with McKenna. At least they believe in producing oil. You seem to be forgetting that Saudi is merely a US proxy in Yemen. Bitch to the US. #cdnpoli

1031 2018-12-10 22:15:07 It is twitter, if you dont want someone on your timeline make your account private. 

Just as I thought, nothing intelligent to say, keep using oil & it's by products while denouncing it, see who has the last laugh
1032 2018-12-10 22:15:05 It's tragic and no parent should have to endure it, and having that awful thing happen to you is many things, including unfair, and heartbreaking, and soul crushing, but it has nothing to do with the father's bravery. It makes him sympathetic, but brave?
1033 2018-12-10 22:14:55 Falling markets + falling oil prices combination of both.
1034 2018-12-10 22:14:45 Rupert Murdoch & Dick Cheney plan to drill for oil in the Golen Heights.  This tax payer is not interested in adding a cent to the $38 billion we pledged Israel for military defense.  Protecting these jerks' investments is not my idea of looking after American interests

1037 2018-12-10 22:14:26 thing is, monopolies aren’t just “oh, well. that’s too big.” (standard oil was rare exception) 

the courts have flip flopped on deciding what percentage is “cornering the market” even in the futures market. 

why settle on something unresolvable? says there’s a “monopoly stage”
1038 2018-12-10 22:14:17 Like balancing a pot of oil on one's head
1039 2018-12-10 22:14:15 It’s looch, I suggest that you make your peace with it. Can’t see the oil giving up anyone else.
1040 2018-12-10 22:14:06 sana oil
1041 2018-12-10 22:14:01 Your line of reasoning is laughable. Wasn't Nigeria doing fine before d discovery of oil. Where did Singapore prime minister get the funds it used in building Singapore economy. Economic intellectual dynamics beckons d president to diversify d country away from oil.
1042 2018-12-10 22:13:36 Le gilet de sauvetage de @EmmanuelMacron va nous couter plus cher que l'augmentation de la taxe sur le gas oil qui elle devait sauver la planète....

Oil is down 33%
Commodity price index down 19%
10y rate down 9%
S&P 500 down 10%
inflation is no more a risk

1046 2018-12-10 22:13:10 This is for everyone who thinks Trudeau buys Saudi Oil. We have a free market, and no government, provincial or federal buys oil. Oil companies, like Shell, or Esso buy oil, and they buy it where they can get the best price. I cannot believe I have to post this.

1047 2018-12-10 22:13:09 @clarins_uk  can you mix the tonic oil like few drops into your bath along with tonic shower gel or do u have to put it straight onit skin thanks xx
1048 2018-12-10 22:13:04 Make sure you set your oven to 425 and have your skillet in there so that it is up to temperature.  10 minutes before you pour your batter in pour enough oil to cover the  bottom.  I was taught this in deer camp, from a dear departed friend and Brother.

1053 2018-12-10 22:12:48 @ImranKhanPTI do measures to give immediate releif to our people. First is prices, I have seen before, if oil prices rise, bus/ train fares, prices of common commodities change un-necessarily high, contrary to that when oil prices drop down, the benefit of cheap oil is not

1054 2018-12-10 22:12:35 When I criticize someone's parenting and marriage but they don't respond it tells me everything I need to know. Sadly there is no hope for that kind of man. A curse upon your house has been self inflicted.

1056 2018-12-10 22:12:12 Yep and I was one who said naive and look what Nats did with those questions they got, argue for the oil industry. When I vote for representatives I vote for them to represent me not give my representation away to the party I voted against.

I will say I LOVED the concept but
1057 2018-12-10 22:12:05 Not exactly true - HW was labelled out-of-touch, blood-for-oil warmonger, Skull&Bones Trilateral Commission One-World-Order Globalist type ... I could go on ...

1059 2018-12-10 22:11:52 Do is AB rich, or poor? Curious as to how you will respond. Also how do the proposed and recent changes to EI and rail oil cars offset this? Beyond that what do You stand For, instead of what you think the feds and other provinces have done Against AB?
1060 2018-12-10 22:11:48 Hair stylist here . Olaplex no.3 is amazing and you can also follow up with the olaplex shampoo and conditioner. Make sure to use oils and deep conditioning treatments. STAY FAR AWAY FROM COCONUT OIL!!! It coats the hair so much that you’ll have problems in the future if you
1061 2018-12-10 22:11:34 So why are you supporting corruption? Why are you supporting outrageously increasing the potential for oil spills? You make zero sense. If any oil is dirty, Nigerian oil is and you support this because you care NOTHING about the environment!
1062 2018-12-10 22:11:33 Idk why i shld explain how an audit into oil losses may not uncover misuse of state resources when that is one of the purposes of the audit. Silly question Kemoy. The point is the forensic audit ought to cover all areas of misappropriation or unexplained use of state resources
1063 2018-12-10 22:11:31 Did you put that oil on it?
1064 2018-12-10 22:11:26 261. "Darkness Falls" (Mark Beamon #5) involves a realistic, chain-reaction depiction of how society would break down if the world's oil supply was quickly destroyed. Would've been interesting to see that bleak world in #6, but I'd rather @KyleMillsAuthor keep writing Mitch Rapp!
1065 2018-12-10 22:11:16 I'm not saying a Scottish government would have been any different but successive WM governments have used oil/gas revenues plus NI/pension money to fund tax cuts and it's only recently this has come to the fore. Norway on the other hand.....
1066 2018-12-10 22:11:09 I spent a night i n lokichar, the upcoming oil city. Nothing to show for all the efforts. In lodwar town, I befriended some turkana boys who don't remember ever having two meals in a day. The road from lokichar to lodwar and kakuma is a testimony of neglect
1067 2018-12-10 22:11:09 @realDonaldTrump Did you really asked for oil payments from Iraqi ministers after so much killing in Iraq without any evidence of mass destruction weapons. Hopefully Oval office will never have a disgraceful personality like you ever again Mr POTUS.
1068 2018-12-10 22:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: soggy crust with sweet coconut oil and pineapple.
1069 2018-12-10 22:11:07 Dirty palm oil is just the same as clean palm oil just that dirty is sourced from more recently cleared forests. Eventually all dirty palm oil will become clean when there’s no forest left. This is rubbish. I’m wondering about Greenpeace’s integrity. Stinks.
1070 2018-12-10 22:11:05 As for Alberta doing “better”, the federal government has openly declared that they want to shut down the oil sands. Most of Albertans depend on them.

1072 2018-12-10 22:10:51 Beauty tips for health skin & hair. Try to limit washing your hair to no more than twice a week (unless recommended more), drink water, use salon quality products instead of drug store brands, hydrate the hair and skin with a light oil like coconut oil & take a vitamin, if allow
1073 2018-12-10 22:10:49 Federal Government to allocate oil blocks to States for Infrastructural Development?

Hellooo
1074 2018-12-10 22:10:49 I'd say oil down is very consumer bullish (wouldn't want it to fall too much more)

Inflation - agree, non existent.  For every uptick, I'll give you 4 disruptive threats

#1 - Psychology.  FEDs haven't clued in yet how fast it can change, esp after mkt breakdown
1075 2018-12-10 22:10:35 Just had some seriously good tasting deer meat, he said it was the hams cut up ~2.5-4” strips marinated in fresh ground garlic, olive oil & low sodium soy sauce...then on the smoker
1076 2018-12-10 22:10:32 Is it worrying that we could be so dependent on microservices from Amazon or Google in the future? Although we are calling them commodities, I can still get my electricity and oil from different suppliers and I'm not sure how that would work in software....
1077 2018-12-10 22:10:22 Will never buy another @FordCanada  product. Spontaneously shattering glass, 3 leaking oil pans, and several steering shaft issues. Horrible customer service and zero accountability at both the corporate & dealership level will ensure this Ford, our third will be the last.
1078 2018-12-10 22:10:17 Olive oil conditioning masks, purple shampoo/blue conditioner, regular trims, less heat (more heat protectant), coconut oil!

1084 2018-12-10 22:09:35 On Monday evenings I hang out with real* people.
Them: what do you do for a living?
Me: I play with with metals used in , , and oil&gas.
Them: Oh. That sounds complicated.
Me: It's a posh way of saying I understand how you break a spoon by bending it too much.
Them: Cool.
1085 2018-12-10 22:09:34 I’m an Oil Kings season ticket holder and we got tired of asking for LED goal lights that wouldn’t obstruct the view so we moved to center ice. Much easier option with the Oil Kings.

1088 2018-12-10 22:08:57 Wilmer is absolutely one of the worst offenders in terms of sourcing palm oil from recently cleared forests. It needed a big image makeover. This is it. I don’t trust them nor do I trust Greenpeace any more.
1089 2018-12-10 22:08:57 Try coconut oil after showering
1090 2018-12-10 22:08:54 Hmm, low gas prices = no oil protesters.  Amazing??
1091 2018-12-10 22:08:53 Use the boob-ease nipple cream it’s in a black container it’s good for keeping them from cracking AND if you have a pump, oil your nips then pump rather than nurse until they heal

you have all my love and more
1093 2018-12-10 22:08:44 that option is really crazy. I don't know people thinking like that, except for Politicians receiving "donations".  
Lets make it an emergency to change to Green Energy as soon as possible. Any money you put on that will be saved when we don't use oil.
1094 2018-12-10 22:08:35 Sure! I’ll type it up after work! It requires ammonium carbonate and anise oil (not extract - it’ll change the entire texture of the cookies) both of which can be hard to find. I’ll include links for where to find those.
1095 2018-12-10 22:08:05 We prefer refined grapeseed oil, as we have found on our pans that flaxseed is more prone to flaking. While saturated fats (lard, coconut) are fine to keep your pan oiled, they aren't the best choice for oven seasoning as they don’t allow carbon molecules to bond as well.

1097 2018-12-10 22:07:50 Yes, rss eco wing been burning midnight oil to work out a solution on ..........

‘How a lump of gober comes and how a lump of gober is spent’
1098 2018-12-10 22:07:43 Holy strong dollar $UUP and weak oil $USO Batman! Not exactly a bull market setup but hey if Bulls want to jump in another trap and pop us for a day or two I won't fight it. Ready to short. $QQQ $SPX $SPY
1099 2018-12-10 22:07:37 My oil change really 100$ dollars 
1100 2018-12-10 22:07:37 China owns USA oil patents due to buying into oil in the nation ages ago,
1101 2018-12-10 22:07:36 So it was better when standard oil owned 91% of the oil market in America? As opposed to the 30 or so companies they split it into?
1102 2018-12-10 22:07:32 Clearly you know a lot about the use of oil.
1103 2018-12-10 22:07:27 Oil Risks Range-Bound Prices Following OPEC Cut as Russia Eyes $55-65
1104 2018-12-10 22:07:17 Pretty sure buying “dealership certified” cars is a bit of handwavery bs, but hey, free oil changes. 
1105 2018-12-10 22:07:01 I like that part 'rust pussy needing oil'
1106 2018-12-10 22:06:49 It a complete understanding that oil has had its day and its time to move forward.
1107 2018-12-10 22:06:44 So, is the State supposed to buy everything for certain people? Is there a limit? My mother is a pensioner and lives alone. Her house is well insulated and we each of us top up her oil tank from time to time - though she objects. Should we just expect the state to do it?
1108 2018-12-10 22:06:42 She looks hot in oil
1109 2018-12-10 22:06:35 I made the trip from NY against the Dolphins. First time at Lucas Oil.. You’re going to love it! Enjoy!
1110 2018-12-10 22:06:32 grapeseed oil ini ternyata mantoel ya dipake sebagai hair tonic
1111 2018-12-10 22:06:24 help clean the oil spill they caused when they bombed the power plant --all the bragging about how great they are & all the stuff they have & yet they did nothing--or at minimum fucking pay back the ppl who did go clean up what they caused
1112 2018-12-10 22:06:23 Amin Ya Rabbi
1113 2018-12-10 22:06:23 Pretty much ALL palm oil is grown on forest cleared in the last few decades. So if palm oil is cleared within a few years of year ‘x’ then it’s dirty, but cleared earlier it’s ‘clean’. So eventually all dirty palm oil will become clean when there’s no forest left. This is rubbish
1114 2018-12-10 22:06:19 Four Kenya Pipeline Company senior managers yesterday denied graft charges arising from the Sh1.9 billion Kisumu Oil Jetty scandal.
They are MD Joe Sang, company secretary Gloria Khafafa and Supply chain manager Vincent Cheruiyot.
1115 2018-12-10 22:06:06 Russia is already basically controlling Iranian oil... guess you want them to spread to SA too?
1116 2018-12-10 22:06:04 They did a lot less damage than imbeciles like "Nuns on the Bus" in the USA or the others who built  a chapel in path of a disputed oil pipeline and tried to claim it was holy ground. Displacement activities!
1117 2018-12-10 22:05:49 This SAME EXACT THING happened to me this morning. Ask you super if she can go get some white lithium lubricant. It's a spray and usually sold where the WD40 is. (That WD40 isn't a true lubricant. It's a penetrating oil, but it was designed to repel water.)
1118 2018-12-10 22:05:42 My cars getting fixed and i literally cant do anything until i get it back. I just went in for an oil change and now theyre trying to tack on a bunch of time consuming things onto that and my mom is flipping her lid and im like... they just want more money. Chill
1119 2018-12-10 22:05:36 5) last but not least is the fact that China & US are in a death grip over trade which might hurt Russia a little but is doing real damage to China & US! What exactly is Russia offering China that the US couldn’t do better for both concerned! Oil? We have plenty! Suit yourself!
1120 2018-12-10 22:05:34 This asshole White House and Trump Crime Family will do anything and everything for a buck, and to protect those that should not be protected by our country at all.  And all because of money and oil.  What has this country become under Trump?
1121 2018-12-10 22:05:33 3000billion tons of gold has value,3000billion tons of oil has value,What is 3000billion tons of CO2 worth? Or 1 gal of water weight 8.375 lbs.1Ton of water represents 16,750 gallons. There are more than 326 million trillion gallons of water on Earth.CO2 is a fart  in a mitten.
1122 2018-12-10 22:05:28 Rapid retreat from coal, oil and gas is unrealistic. What is not true about that statement?
1123 2018-12-10 22:05:17 Peppermint oil.
1124 2018-12-10 22:05:15 She's calling him a coward because he was a coward.  He did absolutely nothign to reign in Trump's excesses and now we have kids in cages, trade wars, murdered journalists, obstruction of justice, and blatant corruption all over the place.
1125 2018-12-10 22:05:09 Where in the F....k is all the oil money Alberta made the past 50 years ....the CONSERVATIVES GAVE IT AWAY ...F.......KKKKKKKK
1126 2018-12-10 22:04:36 No. The one the SNP have lumbered you with. And you might find your oil and gas reserves might be a price you pay for membership.

1129 2018-12-10 22:04:12 I don’t think you understand
UK does not get the profits from gas and oil.

The Govt gets the revenues

And the WM corruption in that item alone is staggering!

We actually gave the oil companies a rebate last year while Norway (the other half of N Sea oil) collected at £2bn
1130 2018-12-10 22:04:10 They value money  over people. They are also very powerful because they have manipulated the world to be dependent on oil. Miami Beach is feeling the effects of the rising sea level every time it rains. They are using pumps to drain the water after it rains.
1131 2018-12-10 22:04:02 Oil paintings are 
1132 2018-12-10 22:04:00 Ever lost a child?
1133 2018-12-10 22:03:59 So the palm oil lobby is buying promoted tweets on Twitter while satirists are getting their accounts cancelled for offending some people.
1134 2018-12-10 22:03:57 60,000 Liters of Oil Spills From Pipeline Into Brazilian Bay: About 60,000 liters (15,850 gallons) of oil spilled from a… @environmentguru
1135 2018-12-10 22:03:54 Interesting logic Rachel.

Is it the same logic that the NRA is not tying anyone down and forcing them to buy guns? How about oil companies tying people down to use energy? 

Ironic that liberals are all for "choice" when it's a policy they support. Otherwise, ban everything else

1139 2018-12-10 22:03:40 @BroBotFuels Dear Brobot I signed up to your website and ordered heating oil on the 5th for delivery today. I have children and no oil left at all and there was no delivery made. Please help us urgently 07740052007
1140 2018-12-10 22:03:34 Tax carbon and redistribute it as a dividend like they do in Alaska with oil revenues. We all collectively pay the costs so we should collectively benefit from money collected. Also, consumptive taxes burden the poor the most, this most equitably offsets the costs.
1141 2018-12-10 22:03:19 Kid at the store: 

“Momma, if vegetable oil is made out of vegetables and coconut oil is made out of coconut... what is baby oil made out of?”
1142 2018-12-10 22:03:12 Nearly bought some @marksandspencer Mince Pies today and then found that they contain palm oil! Very disappointing. M&S when will you be removing palm oil for your products, please?
1143 2018-12-10 22:02:46 どちゃんこ可愛らしいイケメンさん!素敵やね(*∩ω∩)
1144 2018-12-10 22:02:42 Hiv ye, aye!!!...Oil is coming home...get over it..
1145 2018-12-10 22:02:41 I am periodically reminded that I live in the Texas part of California, aka,, Kern County. Oil, desert, military bases and a lot of Trump supporters.
1146 2018-12-10 22:02:40 So I get back from work, turn the TV on & it’s @DrPhil. This guy is terrible & is nothing more than a modern day snake oil salesman. He’s phony, he uses the struggles of his guest to bolster both his “fame & notoriety”. When lookin & him & his plastic wife all I can do is SMH 
1147 2018-12-10 22:02:39 It’ll be legal on the fact that I can guarantee it’s weak as shit and won’t even come close to actual weed the closest it’ll be is like a cbd extract or oil they chill you out but don’t get you high
1148 2018-12-10 22:02:23 No, but they’re also always complaining about how dry and itchy their beards get in the winter (neglecting to use the Christmas stocking beard oil they received last year)
1149 2018-12-10 22:02:13 Mr.. I like it. Even after obsessing over my bio, you still have some self respect. There’s hope for you yet 
1150 2018-12-10 22:02:02 The health and oil experts folks welcome Exxon mobile
1151 2018-12-10 22:01:53 I’m sooooo fucking tired but I gotta get a oil change 
1152 2018-12-10 22:01:45 We have more money and oil than Saudi Arabia.
1153 2018-12-10 22:01:43  Whenever I would say that to my dad, the first thing he'd say was "Have you changed the oil lately?"
1154 2018-12-10 22:01:42 I could care less if you are in the pocket of big oil. I didn't come to you and start bothering you. Shorts are the one that started attacking me. So do you thing elsewhere while I try to help the Tesla community & fight for a better environment.
1155 2018-12-10 22:01:39 Yes, and around 30% per capita. (Oil consumption here is 1/2 the US average per capita, but the rest is non-household spending.)
1156 2018-12-10 22:01:38 I watched it a couple of times, obviously their working, I don't believe they would be conducting work without permits, if you know the specific area the work is taking place make an enquiry with the B.C Oil and Gas Commission they should be able to tell whata going on.
1157 2018-12-10 22:01:37 The Quebec Premier says there’s no “social acceptability” for an oil pipeline going through Quebec. If so, then shouldn’t Albertans be able to say there’s “no social acceptability” for billions of dollars of Albertans money being sent to Quebec?
1158 2018-12-10 22:01:35 Grape seed oil does wonders for my hair
1159 2018-12-10 22:01:33 He is a coward. Also, Kelly dishonored his own dead son supporting Trump when he went after another Gold Star family.
1160 2018-12-10 22:01:31 Surprised how shameless #Quebec citizens are taking #Alberta money knowing Albertans are having a tough time with Trudeau and Notley land-locking our oil. What a shameful bunch! #canada #news

1162 2018-12-10 22:01:21 @FordCanada closing our doors on our edge yesterday when suddenly the glass in the back shatters..no external forces..lots of comments on boards about this happening to others. This on top of 3 leaking oil pans in 3 years and horrible service will ensure no Fords ever again
1163 2018-12-10 22:01:18 How many times did I burn my goddamn hands with hot oil in the past 20 minutes? Enough to fill my quota for the day? No says God as I SLICE MY FUCKING FINGER OPEN /AGAIN/

1165 2018-12-10 22:00:41 December 10, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1166 2018-12-10 22:00:39 Hmmm took 5 thin boneless porkchops. Diced em, diced a whole onion, fried in a pan with a small bit of oil, added salt, pepper, pinch of herb and some garlic powder. sprinkled half a cup of flour, added a can of chicken broth, a pork gravy packet, and a cup of milk. brout to boil
1167 2018-12-10 22:00:38 "GOATs" lmaoo there is only one goat and thats leo messi.cristiano can score tapins against olive oil farmers in one team league nothing will change
1168 2018-12-10 22:00:38 The hell does that have to do with the environmental & ecological catastrophe caused by Israel when they bombed a power plant & caused a major oil spill that they refused to help clean up?
1169 2018-12-10 22:00:37 U mean the party and cake money? Explain to me how an audit would shed any more light on what we already know abt tht issue. N When u are finished, explain hw an audit into oil losses may not still uncover misuse of state resources.
1170 2018-12-10 22:00:37 Why does my friend’s oil defuser look like the not THIN zone, folks,.
1171 2018-12-10 22:00:36 “They also enjoy oil baths”

1174 2018-12-10 22:00:25 I ran out of oil overnight, had the same issue.  51 degrees is so much worse inside than outside, for reasons unknown. My dog was shivering, yet we went for a walk in 19 degrees the other day, no problem.
1175 2018-12-10 22:00:23 
1176 2018-12-10 22:00:22 It’s the damn poor who drive to their job(s) everyday! If they really cared they would run for office, legislate radical green transpo system, take on the corporate-political landscape that has a GDP literally made of ducks drowned in crude oil, and ride your bike to work!
1177 2018-12-10 22:00:11 身近ぁ..,
1178 2018-12-10 22:00:10 So I’m dropping off my car so my hommie can do an oil change at his job and he tells me to go into the waiting room and my dumbass walks into a closet 
1179 2018-12-10 22:00:08 #CountyBarrhead residents due to the freezing rain, oil and gravel roads are in poor condition. Crews are out. PHPS has canceled the afternoon buses. Parents are to make arrangements.
1180 2018-12-10 22:00:08 He's a shity quarterback plain and simple
1181 2018-12-10 22:00:01 “This administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants.” #ClimateChange
1182 2018-12-10 21:59:55 But you know  politicians would never punish their own. Why do we raise the standard so high?

The forensic audit into the missing oil will return Wheatley to the cabinet (maybe a reshuffle). Did you hear the PM refer to Wheatley as the "Minister", not former? Telling.
1183 2018-12-10 21:59:47 Why that's a blast from the past oil xx
1184 2018-12-10 21:59:35 MASTER THE MARINADE: Mix canned chipotle peppers with orange juice, olive oil, and garlic for an amazing meat marinade!
1185 2018-12-10 21:59:35 Where can I get an oil change at in Baton Rouge ?
1186 2018-12-10 21:59:28 "Cycling is an anticapitalist mode of transportation- efficient, inexpensive, sustainable, clean, and it does not rely on feeding an oil industry that profits off wars."
1187 2018-12-10 21:59:21 Ladies too are doing that. I was once a victim of such lies.
1188 2018-12-10 21:59:17 oil and gas are fungible (methane is methane, there are small variations in the quality of crude, but refiners can adapt), others took the cargo (as China imported from someone else)
1189 2018-12-10 21:59:17 Perhaps oil producing provinces could consider taxing their citizens a sufficient amount to maintain a decent baseline of public services without incurring deficits. Crazy idea, I know.
1190 2018-12-10 21:59:15 Look into using coconut oil instead and soon !! Stop talking about it and just do it !!
1191 2018-12-10 21:59:06 saying that some carbs are better than others... fresh root veg trumps preserved refined grains every time and pressed fat from olives and omega 3 from fish every time over chemically extracted veg oil
1192 2018-12-10 21:58:54 Having curly ass hair means doing coconut oil and castor oil mask on daily basis
1193 2018-12-10 21:58:36 and so many thing change since Oct 3 
oil down 20%+
10y down 10%
Commodity index down 18%
Wage only up 0.1% in Oct  and 0.2% in November 
Global slowdown
Inflation pressure juste switch side to deflation  
thing change FED must change is view
1194 2018-12-10 21:58:17 Oil based economy, oil based health care. Your dad was just pragmatic, kept things simple
1195 2018-12-10 21:58:13 Areas with manufacturing, steel, textiles, aluminum, rail, oil and gas, these have all been the wealthiest areas. Until they were all given away. Now DC is the wealthiest. What does DC produce? Nothing. DC voted 90% against Trump. Why isn’t this glaring headlines everyday?
1196 2018-12-10 21:58:06 I have no understanding why a poor country like France tries to force their politics on the USA. The US economy is larger than the entire EU + China + Japan. Our Navy rules the seas. Never in history has any country had such might. We are the worlds largest producer of oil & gas.
1197 2018-12-10 21:57:57 Pull up the drawbridge and get the oil boiling.
1198 2018-12-10 21:57:51 Is the stanley on oil

1204 2018-12-10 21:57:18 CRUDE OIL

Incessant promotion of upcoming higher oil prices from famous media and twitter energy journos and consultants, trying to lure greater fools for the people who pay them.
1205 2018-12-10 21:57:17 Honestly this guy is a snake oil sales man How anyone can support him is beyond me He has failed in every aspect of the health service & somehow is credited with passing a ref that would have walked home itself Seriously don’t get it Ire needs to look to France for change
1206 2018-12-10 21:57:16 At some point one has to question motivation. People putting everything - their legacies  - on the line to defend a fraud - a reality TV star? Or is it about protecting oil & gas interests? (assuming coal is really a diversion)
1207 2018-12-10 21:57:05 that's also a good Peak Oil sound
1208 2018-12-10 21:57:03 No jobs unless scant wages and no bennies 
That's that ol' time supply side snake oil
That's that voodoo trickling down on you 
The people who do the work need to shut up and keep forking over that do-re-mi 
And smile when you work that OT, boy
1209 2018-12-10 21:56:49 To all the money managers out there that don't understand the performance of oil & think this is not price discovery. You are correct, welcome to the world mining investors have endured for the last 15 years. War on commodities continues & is the new #PriceControls @ericnuttall
1210 2018-12-10 21:56:47 maybe oil is over priced
1211 2018-12-10 21:56:37 Tea tree oil helps !
1212 2018-12-10 21:56:30 
1213 2018-12-10 21:56:12 I would love to see any evidence from over, let’s say, the last quarter century, that our government has been run by the “best qualified people “ as Boot calls them.
1214 2018-12-10 21:56:07 I believe they are wanting the Venezuelan state with nothing to come and take ownership and ownership of the oil.
1215 2018-12-10 21:56:02 Wallahi, and na dem dey insult girls with freedom pass
1216 2018-12-10 21:55:57 Didn’t feel good today and didn’t want to go to work but obviously I went to leave and my oil light came on so I needed to stop and get it checked out now I will be late and end up only working for like 3 hours so I called in. It was fate.
1217 2018-12-10 21:55:56 vitamin e oil
1218 2018-12-10 21:55:52 Albertans pay more in federal taxes per capita because we earn more money than other provinces, "have" vs "have not" ... AB also has lowest tax and still has no sales tax... if AB wanted to reduce it debt it would introduce sales tax and stop counting on another oil boom 
1219 2018-12-10 21:55:49 すこすぎるな
1220 2018-12-10 21:55:45 Harper’s legacy of failure continues to haunt Canada. Harper let Huawei into Canada despite warnings from CISI, he didn’t build a single pipeline to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil and he didn’t have the balls to defund the CBC. His level of incompetence was hard to fathom.
1221 2018-12-10 21:55:36 Baby oil
1222 2018-12-10 21:55:19 I don’t get it, we’ve got the City, a smidgeon of oil and gas, creative industries like you wouldn’t believe, they’ve got, what, wine? Baguettes? Gallic shrugs at the thought of working over 37.5 hours per week?
1223 2018-12-10 21:55:16 so if we ran out of reserves we would all just die? Bullshit, we would survive there is proof that green energy could and would sustain us but oh yes the money makers in oil would have to adapt. All I say is that we all rely too much on oil I did for 25 years now I'am moving on.

1225 2018-12-10 21:55:03 Gotta go get me some olive oil for this fucking earache
1226 2018-12-10 21:54:56 I have a pair exactly like those, love them! Mine are due for heels and a good mink oil rub
1227 2018-12-10 21:54:54 Trump tries this with us. He's trying to get us to ignore how Saudis slaughtered Khashoggi by threatening high oil prices. We get 40% of our oil from Canada. Trump & Kushner got big bucks from Saudis & Putin pulls the strings.
1228 2018-12-10 21:54:42 As there are ecological issues with coal and oil. They pollute the land AND the air.
1229 2018-12-10 21:54:39 I hate how people talk down on you just because you’re a female. I don’t need a man for nothing  I can work, change my tire, check my oil, water, and provide for my kids. A man is just a plus 
1230 2018-12-10 21:53:57 Ah, poi c'è sorossss! Come dimenticare il buon vecchio soros! Poi c'è il peak oil,  la decrescita felice, le palline che lavano i vestiti e le scie chimiche! Ah poi anche le camere a gas che non esistevano. Chissà quante storielle non mi vengono in mente!
1231 2018-12-10 21:53:51 I see what you mean. Remember the GM and board are gone. Integrity commission and MOCA are in there so I think there should be criminal charges . The oil@issue is 5.2 billion. Very important .
1232 2018-12-10 21:53:44 Toh kila yar kano ce ka hadu da ita
1233 2018-12-10 21:53:39 But how does this contradict the point? That a few corporations are mostly responsible doesn't mean the solutions will be easy for the avg 1st-world person, since our way of life depends on those corporations. Imagine how our lives would change if we stopped pumping oil tomorrow.
1234 2018-12-10 21:53:39 New tires, alignment, and oil change. Whip riding like butter
1235 2018-12-10 21:53:38 We are being led into the abyss by the worst ragtag bunch of blaggers and snake oil salesmen in living memory.
1236 2018-12-10 21:53:37 Oil and water!
1237 2018-12-10 21:53:29 The forensic audit is limited only to the oil losses. Not to use of state funds for personal benefit by anybody. So shes dead right. Press conference of empty rhetoric n ppl are tired of it

Don't forget to include some #EVOO Extra Virgin Olive Oil, a tablespoon per day will be OK, and you have hundreds of different cultivars to taste!


1242 2018-12-10 21:53:02 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Stocks struggle higher as markets remain volatile; oil drops
1243 2018-12-10 21:52:54 What is true is that all HydroQuebec users pay into Equalization when they pay their bill, because of GST collected to the federal budget, from which Equalization payments are derived.
Semantics is the attempt by others to treat Hydro as a limited natural resource equal to oil.
1244 2018-12-10 21:52:47 6-The majority of our oil comes from the US, Alberta and Africa. OPEC can effect global prices but we will never be cut off. Saudi Arbia makes up less then 10%, could replace that in a day.
1245 2018-12-10 21:52:46 I have a closure one too but when it’s glued down I was told oil would make it lift
1246 2018-12-10 21:52:20 You want him out since he said no more renewal of oil blocks. Remember it is not just for u but for all of us.

1250 2018-12-10 21:52:09 Oh! Something so what simple, you can do a chicken parmesano with oven baked Aubergine slices sprinkles with some favourite cheese and olive oil~ That's a healthy combo
1251 2018-12-10 21:52:08 In 2007 when oil was $100 US per barrel and Alberta was flying and didn't mind supporting Canada like it always did. When Harper was being accused of supporting big oil? Wonder how that would have fared for the conservatives.

1269 2018-12-10 21:49:57 It is called an "alternative therapy" because it doesn't work. If it worked, we'd call it therapy. You won't find acupuncture, essential oil diffusers, or homeopathy in the hospital. If you do see those things, RUN.

1278 2018-12-10 21:49:30 Oh heaven forbid you get pissed off at Alberta's anti Quebec feelings. Waaaay better to use oil from a country that stones their bitches for not wearing a proper headscarf But as long as your happy

1289 2018-12-10 21:48:40 Quebec doesn’t think it’s wrong to take equalization payments from the west stop pipelines across their province and buy dictator oil from half way around the world!
1290 2018-12-10 21:48:27 Or we can just go all in a corner and die. That seems even better for the animals. What about that? We destroy rainforests and urangutans going extinct so we can produce oil.  Seems better than having ur own animals and grow them with care and respect.

1294 2018-12-10 21:48:19 @francoislegault Hey so you don't like our "dirty energy" but you'll happily mooch our oil money for your province of "have-nots". Can't have it both ways little man.

1299 2018-12-10 21:47:43 In a perfect world, we would want that. But we all know it won’t happen. The oil companies have wayyyy too much power not only in our economy but also in our government sadly
1300 2018-12-10 21:47:40 the booty? soft or firm doesnt matter to me, or are we talking about the moisture from the oil?
1301 2018-12-10 21:47:33 That's unbelievable! It's like an oil painting. I might need a print of this for my wall.

1305 2018-12-10 21:47:05 Fair enough. Contributing to Beto may be the only way ff employees can ask to be freed from the tyranny of oil companies. They may even be best situated to destroying their own company. I hope that is what their contributions mean.

1312 2018-12-10 21:46:34 Lmao years ago but yeah someone told me it’s a good oil to use on your face if you have oily skin. Then I found out it clogs tf outta your pores. I was pissed but I stopped using it ASAP.
1313 2018-12-10 21:46:31 But what about the devastating reports on the impact of reducing the purchase of oil and coal on the most powerful men and corporations in these countries. Alternative sources of energy are a threat to their power and fortunes. And, they will be safely dead before the earth dies.
1314 2018-12-10 21:46:28 anyone using a cleansing oil? which one?

If you think the Liberals are too corporate, vote for another party, but don’t vote Conservative, if you want a fair & liveable future.

1325 2018-12-10 21:45:33 "Haters gonna hate" Such an elementary school response. Give me one good reason why the average guy who is long some puts, ie. short would want the company to fail. Are they all in the pockets of "big oil"? Employed by Koch Industries?

1369 2018-12-10 21:42:08 It would be interesting to hear how this genius would implement a huge carbon tax on “rich” oil companies without impacting the consumers who use their products
1370 2018-12-10 21:42:03 Texas is one state. A state with economic rankings that plummet every time the oil industry takes a hit. Ask Venezuela what happens to people whose entire economy is built on oil.
1371 2018-12-10 21:42:02 After I read Oil!, it made me like PTA even more. The adaptation is fluid, while remaining relevant to the core of the story
1372 2018-12-10 21:41:57 I know coconut oil on the skin is like the holy graille....
1373 2018-12-10 21:41:55 Worlds greatest ever snake oil salesman
1374 2018-12-10 21:41:53 He just put too much oil in it dummy
1375 2018-12-10 21:41:52 There ought to be a global boycott on all palm olive oil stemming from these kind of plantations.
1376 2018-12-10 21:41:46 @jkenney, riddle me this, in 2 years a ton of EV’s will be unleashed by many of the big auto makers. some time after that the majority of new sales will be EV & eventually the majority of total cars. what’s the likelihood that there’ll be as much of a need for Alberta oil then?
1377 2018-12-10 21:41:39 Extremely keen to learn that my shirt is covered in oil stains once I’ve jumped on board the train.
1378 2018-12-10 21:41:32 If they are fried in deep oil, they allude on through.

1380 2018-12-10 21:41:28 Interestingly, tea actually has a higher caffeine content than coffee but less makes it into your body than from coffee.
The reason being that while you consume the oil of the coffee bean, with tea, you consume the flavour, tanning and a very small amount of caffeine
1381 2018-12-10 21:41:28 You fight all that data by HFT oil down as stealth QE or ZIRP if you will.
1382 2018-12-10 21:40:58 Not true Saudi oil makes it to the $IMO refinery at Lake Erie occassional dep on price
1383 2018-12-10 21:40:57 Russia gonna make sure Venezuelan oil is theirs.
1384 2018-12-10 21:40:54 they say lavender oil helps you relax and sleep well, so I’ve drenched my pillow in it and now I feel sick from the smell 
1385 2018-12-10 21:40:54 i mean,,,,, 70% of taste comes from smell so i'm assuming it's just a stronger taste of what we can already smell  + a really viscous oil consistency?
1386 2018-12-10 21:40:52 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
1387 2018-12-10 21:40:52 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1391 2018-12-10 21:40:34 I kinda wanna go work in the oil field for like a year and a half or two so I can get surgery and not do shit for like 10 months.
1392 2018-12-10 21:40:31 In their deffense I'll say it also exists horchata from rice. However the one from that video apparently has oil too.. dunno what to think, nothing like ours I guess
1393 2018-12-10 21:40:30 I am going through the same knot trouble. Try coconut oil. Takes awhile but it works. #knotheadalso

1395 2018-12-10 21:40:24 Spent a grip today on brand new tires called the other place for a oil change luckily they giving me that free !!
1396 2018-12-10 21:40:22 Seafood salad (with light mayo) on a toasted whole wheat sub, with provolone cheese, spinach, tomatoes, banana peppers, pickles, two shakes of salt and pepper and a splash of oil and vinegar.
1397 2018-12-10 21:40:19 U.S. employers added a disappointing 155,000 jobs in November 
America turned into a net oil exporter last week, breaking 75 years of continued dependence on foreign oil
1398 2018-12-10 21:40:10 Exactly! 0bama opened up oil fields (um....no!), he created 3mil+ new jobs (lies!) AND he deported over 3mil illegals (well THAT part IS true!)
 2 outta 3 ain’t bad!
1399 2018-12-10 21:40:08 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
1400 2018-12-10 21:39:59 Only because they are ready to sell nautral gas offshore and they wanted to stop the oil pipeline from alberta.  Its all about  MONEY  IN bc,s bank.  Nothing else
1401 2018-12-10 21:39:58 smart cats know that when the President spews nonsense, a member of congress cries for mama #resist
1402 2018-12-10 21:39:47 @PaulsonNews 
If I were a betting man I would say you think you deserve some trash company as well as oil stock etc.. from Rose Kennedy.   I believe we should let the wishes of the people who own it to desecidre
1403 2018-12-10 21:39:46 Diversi-Tea: a blend of Irish Breakfast, African Rooibos, Darjeeling, and lapsang souchong? Or for the flavors, perhaps a spritz of orange, a dash of Earl Grey's oil of bergamot, and a hint of chai's cardamom, all on a Chinese pu'erh?  Might be kind of busy on the palate.
1404 2018-12-10 21:39:43 Im sure Trudeau Canada wouldn’t allow oil tankers to come in and out of Hudsons Bay!!   EnvironMENTALists would blow a gasket about polar bears and whales as well!!
1405 2018-12-10 21:39:39 The point dipshit is that by calling the press the enemy of the people he is encouraging violence against the media, by refusing to repudiate MBS and Saudi Arabia he shows his approval of such violence against the press.
1406 2018-12-10 21:39:36 Nigga James look like sumbody threw oil on him 
1407 2018-12-10 21:39:35 Now if we can take Greed out of “MARKETING DECISIONS” Diesel will go lower than gas, but then the Oil Companies want to screw the crap out of the trucking industry!
1408 2018-12-10 21:39:33 Justin, if you REALLY cared, then quit doing the oil tygoon's bidding and keep water, air clean.  Our young, indigenous, weak, and old are vulnerable to consequences from the use of fossil fuels. We all are.
1409 2018-12-10 21:39:29 Apparently if you don't immediately fall over yourself and grovel as soon as a SJW demands an apology you are somehow a coward? #OccasionalCortex logic. Heads they win, tails we lose.
1410 2018-12-10 21:39:21 In every case...Trump acts in his own interest every time... even such things as oil drilling ..he wanted oil drilling to go in all down the California coastline and in Florida but not in front of Mara Lago.. nobody said anything..
1411 2018-12-10 21:39:18 Grandpa is off his meds again....    you keep talking like people will believe your snake oil pitch.    If you would just shut up, life would be easier for you.

1415 2018-12-10 21:38:55  just let put a few drops of anointing oil on the cover and all will be well.
1416 2018-12-10 21:38:48 Agreed- so why Keep buying that Saudi oil and denying a pipeline from Alberta? Who has more human rights atrocities?

1418 2018-12-10 21:38:35 Please don't forget anything with a fish oil taste!
1419 2018-12-10 21:38:29 Alberta should slap tariffs on all oil coming into country to be refined here and sold .... all Saudi oil coming into Canada should have tariffs attached to help curb the use of foreign oil!
1420 2018-12-10 21:38:22 Oil and water
1421 2018-12-10 21:38:20 i get aggravated quick on that oil ion even be wantin to talk 
1422 2018-12-10 21:38:14 And shipping oil by train is better for the environment then pipelines? To say Alberta doesn't care about the environment clearly you don't know much about our province.
1423 2018-12-10 21:38:12 Mafikisolo bode oil magnate
1424 2018-12-10 21:38:07 Had we voted yes, then the oil boom/revenue turned out to be lies, and the austerity max hit as Sturgeon admits and the taxes rose and the businesses and taxpayers fled and we’d have been out of the EU for 36 months then by 10/12/18 Scotland would be in a desperate position.
1425 2018-12-10 21:38:06 I love it. It’s good with olive oil mixed in with it.
1426 2018-12-10 21:38:04 its impossible to be a shawol and be homophobic that shit just doesnt mix like water and oil dont TRY that
1427 2018-12-10 21:37:56 I really want to start working with oil paints I think it'd be better for the type of art that I do but they're so god damn expensive. 100ml tube of acrylic costs less than 10$ and oil for that same amount is about 40$
1428 2018-12-10 21:37:50 So killing hundreds of human beings & the numerous oil spills in Nigeria while buying their oil, accomplishes this how. NIMBYism much?
1429 2018-12-10 21:37:48 why accept that the dissemination of knowledge has the same greed and obligation to share-holders than the oil, agrochemical, financial, etc. industries? Just because they can, it makes it right. No need for greed in the publication of scientific results!
1430 2018-12-10 21:37:45 World demand for oil is growing so it’s not a dying industry. You know what’s not fair? “Fighting for democracy” by arguing with Canadian politicians yet not arguing against Saudi Oil replacing Canadian oil in Eastern Canada.
1431 2018-12-10 21:37:44 Instead of Greek Yogurt, use 1 cup water + 2 Tbsp. coconut oil or 1 cup coconut water in your Green Smoothie. #lesscalories #nomucous #vegan
1432 2018-12-10 21:37:11 I've been interested in this for a while but didn't know where to start, brand, strength, oil, capsules etc. Did you find a supplier in the U.K.? Xx
1433 2018-12-10 21:37:11 Question for you Cam. I would like to purchase a CBD oil with 250mg and a little THC 3-1 ratio. Would this be considered medical cbd oil or is it available Rec?
1434 2018-12-10 21:37:09 Today’s plan: 
Take car from oil change 
Study for finals

Today’s reality: 
Take car for oil change 
Get told car is totaled in repairs 
Have lunch
Give up on Susan and get a new car
Maybe study at some point
1435 2018-12-10 21:37:08 if you were the cable for the mini humidifier/essential oil diffuser I have, where would you be?

if your answer to that was "still inside the device because you bought it and never used it", I wish you'd saved me some time and told me that fifteen minutes ago.
1436 2018-12-10 21:37:06 I ride to and from work on an electric streetcar and/or subway. But by all means, keep covering for big oil as they destroy our environment.
1437 2018-12-10 21:37:00 Marula oil?
1438 2018-12-10 21:36:58 If you are experiencing congestion in your head and/or chest, add some citrus to your diet and reduce your dairy consumption.  Eucalyptus oil in a diffuser may help clear up that stuffy feeling head as well. In a pinch, Vicks Vapor Rub does the trick!
1439 2018-12-10 21:36:45 Alberta could leave the oil and gas behind and progress into the future of green energy but no we sit and wait for the oil companies to come back and a pipeline that  will take 10 years to build ignorance is from people who want to split I know the U.S. would love that land water
1440 2018-12-10 21:36:38 Ohh realy ?? India is not oil economy like cenezuala becoz in venezuala they were habituated for FREE like congress likes to give farmers loan wavers
1441 2018-12-10 21:36:32 You know that cooking oil advert, right? Well, I’d quite happily stuff that bowl of roasted spuds in my gob in one sitting.

I’d just need enough thick as fuck gravy to drown each & every one of those spuds in, & it’d be perfect. 

I’m dribbling at the thought, to be honest.
1442 2018-12-10 21:36:31 How many Native students? Schools? Are you going to teach them how greed destroyed our planet and that the Native Americans told you that would happen?! That they are cleaner energy alternatives out there but you allow it to be suppressed! Cause you want to manipulate oil prices
1443 2018-12-10 21:36:28 Sure. To each their own.
1444 2018-12-10 21:36:23 does this mean this government is going to stop buying Saudi oil as a stand against the human rights infractions of the Saudis... no it is just more fluff with no stuff
1445 2018-12-10 21:36:03 I hate when you go get an oil change and then they come back with a list of things you “need to buy.” Like hold on, lemme call all my dad, my brother, my fiancé, and my 3 other car guys to see if they will do it for a cheaper price.
1446 2018-12-10 21:36:01 Why does each province get to decide for the whole country ? Tje Feds need to make a law to stop this baloney. Heres another option build a pipeline to Churchill. Buy a number of ice breakers and lets get this oil to market. Cause i gaurantee you this MB and SK will be fine wthit
1447 2018-12-10 21:35:54 June 21, 2018:
Two senior staffers at Petrojam resigned out of frustration at developments rocking the State-owned oil refinery, a reliable source told the Jamaica Observer.

1449 2018-12-10 21:35:35 So today is the first day I have to pay for my oil change myself and tbh I’m mad asf. This hoe cost $50, an extra $10 on gas to get me here and i aint ask for none of this. I aint even ask for my mf car. I don’t want to adult anymore. I don’t want none of this. I’m dying.
1450 2018-12-10 21:35:16 I make mine: coconut oil, white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. it tastes good too
1451 2018-12-10 21:35:15 Bullshit  I go all out w the oil & lotion & he does it for not even 5 mins & quits or tries to fuck when I just wanna be rubbed down like I did for him
1452 2018-12-10 21:35:12 I make a warm side dish of quinoa, garbanzo beans, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, & fresh parsley covered in a lemon & olive oil dressing with paprika that is so yummy!
1453 2018-12-10 21:35:07 I feel like the word fraud requires some amount of self awareness.  

If a snake oil salesman truly believes in the snake oil, delusional seems a better descriptor.

1458 2018-12-10 21:34:27 That would depend whether oil make playoffs as McDavid would be ruled ineligible to receive the award if that was the case.
1459 2018-12-10 21:34:26 I prefer to DIY. Sugar+almond oil+essential oils. Nothing else is really needed imo and it’s cheaper
1460 2018-12-10 21:34:24 So you would have preferred PMJT to not buy it ? To not try and get more oil to tidewater? 
Harper had 10 yrs and couldn’t manage it, why do you expect Trudeau to wave a wand and have pipelines just appear ?

1464 2018-12-10 21:34:03 I thought Venezuela government ran out of money because they thought their money (oil income) was unlimited.  And gave it all away.  Is there something else?
1465 2018-12-10 21:34:03 Don’t be idiots and we won’t have anything negative to say. Blocking our pipelines while taking transfer payments and buying oil from the Saudis gives us every reason to be opposed. How do you justify that BS?
1466 2018-12-10 21:34:01 Go for it.  And, yes, he is a snake oil salesman, an outside talker, a shyster.

1468 2018-12-10 21:33:55 Isn't it that people embellished the 'woman taken in adultery' as 'a prostitute' or maybe the woman who washed Jesus' feet with oil who was also a 'fallen woman,' and then added the spin that she was Mary Magdalene. It's obviously a good twist on things.
1469 2018-12-10 21:33:52 Thanks, Fil. What’s the DeMark outlook for oil?
1470 2018-12-10 21:33:48 Lobster... but with  Onion

  1  lb of  Lobster,  Whole 
  1 1/2  cup of  Onion,  Diced 
  1 1/2  pinch of  Soy Sauce 

 Marinate  Lobster in 3/4 cup Olive Oil and  Soy Sauce for 1 hour. 
 Saute  Lobster and  Onion until done. 
 Let chill for 1 3/4 hour(s). 

 Happy Cooking!
1471 2018-12-10 21:33:42 Well, on top of having to get 4 new tires & an oil change for roughly $887, my dog just suddenly had a major sick event & will be going to the vets in an hour, so that's atleast another $120....if I even get the car back by then...

Correct:"they didn't need to create tensions, the tensions were already there, so they just threw oil on the fire to worsen them up. As long as it benefits them. They didn't create the american distrust of the media"

1483 2018-12-10 21:32:49 Canada doesn't buy saudi oil.

Private companies like Irving Oil buys it.
1484 2018-12-10 21:32:49 Ooh. And it fries okay? Do you still need oil?

1489 2018-12-10 21:32:33 Then there should be no problem to borrow and help the oil industry. Why do you expect the ROC to bail you out? I will double check your net debt figures; seems low from when I last saw it. You live in a cyclical  world and should be prepared to handle it. Nimbys are the issue.
1490 2018-12-10 21:32:33 45Q CCS tax break in US is massive - big enough to be game changing, with global ripple effect, be good to know more. Is it broad CCS, so varied and more 'CDR', or just flue-based capture and mainly CO2 boosted oil extraction?
1491 2018-12-10 21:32:30 The writer was, and probably still is, a paid shill for the Saudi government since he was formerly a spokesman for a Saudi gov’t controlled oil company. Hence, the very pro-House of Saud “journalistic” slant.
1492 2018-12-10 21:32:29 Also a lack of respect for Confederation and knowledge of history; without Alberta's oil money their power plant would not have been built. #unitecanada stop the divisive politics that serve only the greed of some politicians and do little for this nation. #cdnpoli

1501 2018-12-10 21:31:32 Meaning I cannot use this analysts to say that the price should go up, down or sideways. What drove valuation was speculation and leverage, not the demand for the network. So until the day speculation becomes secondary to real use (oil, copper, corn), prices can keep falling.
1502 2018-12-10 21:31:30 Abhi Iran bechara apna oil bechane k liye India se dollar k badale rupay me dega oil .fir kya Saudi bola main India ko sasta or rupaye me oil muhaiya karaunga jara batana bhai itana tezi kyu
1503 2018-12-10 21:31:28 Sorry but NesQuick is not wrong.
1504 2018-12-10 21:31:27 Did I say wind power was free? The cost of constructing per M watt is a lot higher than, say , a coal station but the fuel source for wind is free,  It costs money for coal or oil.  Once you built a wind farm it's just maintenance.  Wait until solar efficiency gets to 90%.
1505 2018-12-10 21:31:21 ‘Sorry’ isn’t going to clean up that oil.
1506 2018-12-10 21:31:11 I do not understand why Oil Rich country like #Iraq cannot take care of their suffering #Yazidi population.
1507 2018-12-10 21:31:01 my brothers grandma found his oil pen in his room when she was cleaning and she didn’t know what it was so she showed my mom + my mom took a hit to show her it was for smoking and she didn’t know it was weed sksksksksk 
1508 2018-12-10 21:31:01 SOPHIE'S OIL OF EVERY PEARL UN-INSIDES is brain rape in a good way

1512 2018-12-10 21:30:25 Hey there, our spread does include organic palm oil.
1513 2018-12-10 21:30:21 The only thing to do with out-of-season tomatoes is to roast them for hours in a bath of olive oil, garlic, oregano, and thyme then turn them into pasta sauce. 
1514 2018-12-10 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1515 2018-12-10 21:30:05 You have heard it said, data is the new oil.

But truly I say to you, data is the new snake oil.
1516 2018-12-10 21:30:03 Nope. 

Chavez had his faults, even big ones, but he did the right thing taking control of the oil industry.

Real problems started after him falling sick. His successor Maduro is corrupt, violent, incompetent and a puppet of the military. 

He is as left leaning as Trump is.

1519 2018-12-10 21:29:53 Meanwhile the Donald gets on with pushing the economy forward becoming self sufficient in oil and reducing their carbon footprint 
1520 2018-12-10 21:29:47 Congratulations!!! Nuts, soy milk, peanut butter, oil, tofu really helped me. But I never had terrible nausea as long as I ate first thing in the morning, so probably not the best person to ask.
1521 2018-12-10 21:29:46 With oil barons frm 4 countries eating up precious hours at #COP24 to push for weakened language in reports, it appears their intent in part may be 2 run out the clock before significant targets, actions & accountability measures are in place.

1522 2018-12-10 21:29:46 Funny how stocks rebounded but oil continued to sell off.
Have you figured out cheap oil is the new ZIRP yet?
You get cheap oil the same way you got ZIRP using HFT w counterfeited money.
1523 2018-12-10 21:29:42 Need another oil change  but kinda already knew that
1524 2018-12-10 21:29:38 my lipstick is so matte that I had to remove it with coconut oil and idk how but it stained my sink... my mom's an angel but she's gonna beat my ass

1527 2018-12-10 21:29:29 Legault promised he'd improve relations with Canada ... guess what ... Legault lied ... the political elite will do & say whatever's required to get themselves elected to power ... he was downright gleeful in pronouncing CDN oil 'dirty' ... old PQuiste is PQuiste still ...
1528 2018-12-10 21:29:29 honestly.....jojoba oil
1529 2018-12-10 21:29:28 I just got a ten minute oil change and my car is driving amazing. It starts up better & everything
1530 2018-12-10 21:29:06 Niggas think they slick but I'm baby oil bitchhhhhh
1531 2018-12-10 21:28:26 These are questions only asked by white stoners Chips. You can't smoke out of it cause you can't burn anything in it, the entire system is under vacuum so no air spot. You can make a more concentrated THC oil in it though!
1532 2018-12-10 21:28:12 What's the cost to build a refinery & refine the oil in Alberta? I heard May speaking about this. Is that possible? And Que resistance is about political power not the enviro...if they had the same oil as AB there would 10 pipelines coming out & they would separate!
1533 2018-12-10 21:28:00 I love the look of this game when it’s in full swing and you have rigs and barrels of oil all over the map!

1535 2018-12-10 21:27:38 just saw awesome news that parents who used cannabis oil to treat their kid who has autism weren’t charged and walked free!!! marijuana is illegal here but the fact the judge knew it wasn’t yanno the wrong thing to do is so good
1536 2018-12-10 21:27:32 Castor oil has made my hair grow so much so fast. It’s actually kind of ridiculous
1537 2018-12-10 21:27:24 Cute.  But seriously.  Use Alberta oil or import Saudi oil, which is better for Canadians?  If you hate oil so much, stop using anything that is fueled by or made using it.
1538 2018-12-10 21:27:21 Hi Eram, if you contact KTC directly they'll be able to assist you further about the Almond Hair Oil. The sponge is 6cm in height so I would say small - Thanks Annie
1539 2018-12-10 21:27:20 Actually I think it accurate. Our resources doesn't match the quality of life here. Seen the video of people scooping cooking oil our?

It's really bad
1540 2018-12-10 21:27:18 Just finish this Razorback training. It’s 24 x 36 and I have a custom frame made from Arkansas Barn Wood by big Al’s rustic frame. Original oil on canvas. Message me for details if you’re interested. Thank you
1541 2018-12-10 21:27:14 We’ll pay oil marketers N236Bn by Friday - FG
1542 2018-12-10 21:27:03 İt’s not because of communism, but American capitalism and imperialism! Venezuela has one of the most oil reserves in the world, but can’t produce or sell it because it doesn’t want to bow to evil US!!!
1543 2018-12-10 21:26:57 Meanwhile, the sit in a jail cell warmed by oil.  should make em buck up, and let em sit out in the cold, while they are processed.
1544 2018-12-10 21:26:53 Are bhai India waise bhi Saudi se 2nd sabse bada dealler hai ab tum batao agar India Saudi se na le oil to India ko kami to nahi hoga pr kahi or se mil jayega pr Saudi apna bahut bada loss jhelega
1545 2018-12-10 21:26:50 Three girls gave me same excuse after wasting my time and energy 
1546 2018-12-10 21:26:48 An he luvs oil money??
1547 2018-12-10 21:26:36 follow the oil you find the money
1548 2018-12-10 21:26:36 When picking which CBD oil you’ll use to cure your cancer, do you go with the more well known gas station or do you go with the more local gas station to get your product?
1549 2018-12-10 21:26:34 No she’s been afflicted with tds
1550 2018-12-10 21:26:33 I’ve been sitting at the ford dealership for 3 hours while they “change my oil” and this is the reason why I have trust issues
1551 2018-12-10 21:26:30 So Saddam was gassing his own people? Obviously not enough! So the West attacks & murders 1 million people & destroys all infrastructure. Then Western countries award themselves lucrative contracts to rebuild what they knocked down using Iraq oil revenues to pay for it.
So clever
1552 2018-12-10 21:26:30 First time in 70 years, US is number one exporter of OIL thank you, Mr. Trump.  Now shove your carbon taxes, all it does is takemthe wealth from the middle class, ala France
1553 2018-12-10 21:26:26 Tax carbon.  Its the easiest way to do it. Rich oil barons will just find ways to avoid the tax.  Or as @Dividends123 says, pass along the costs.  100% agree the tax $ should be used for renewable innovation, but also, infrastructure.  Bad infrastructure causes huge carbon waste.
1554 2018-12-10 21:26:19 Doesnt matter if OPEC or Trump or everything else   oil still goes down
1555 2018-12-10 21:26:06 yup. He's a master conman. The most devious and insidious snake oil salesman of the century, who loves a good distraction.
1556 2018-12-10 21:26:02 It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
1557 2018-12-10 21:25:56 I agree with the points, but I cannot support the former Gov of Colorado. Gov. Hickenlooper consistently sided with Oil/Gas Industry over objections of local officials and residents to impose fracking on front range counties
1558 2018-12-10 21:25:55 Nuke,oil and coal. Lots of coal. Nuke can run electricity and large ships. It's politics that mostly stops all progress.
1559 2018-12-10 21:25:54 CBD oil's working brilliantly, still have a lot of tightness & pressure in neck & back but it's more tolerable that could be down to sleeping better too 
1560 2018-12-10 21:25:54 Jordan Peterson is all jibberish. Lots of words very little substance. He’s a snake oil salesmen. Real intellects are Hitchens, Dillahunty, Dawkins.......

#SmockingGun #trump #Truth @jordanbpeterson
1561 2018-12-10 21:25:51 If Alberta remains any sort of democracy then people will vote themselves high share of oil wealth. It's highly unlikely it will not remain a democracy.
1562 2018-12-10 21:25:48 LMAO V! I think that means you need an oil change  because same!
1563 2018-12-10 21:25:45 Get over yourselves! You were third world troglodytes until the yanks helped you get the oil and gas out of the north Sea! Takk takk!
1564 2018-12-10 21:25:43 Alberta and Ontario already co-opting these people for the oil industry and far right extremists.
1565 2018-12-10 21:25:41 Scotland leaving the UK will have a major impact on the UK’s finances, no more oil revenue, no more fishing in Scotland’s water, no more whisky tax, no more gin/beer tax, no more food tax, no more nuke storage in our waters. Aye a huge impact for rUK,
1566 2018-12-10 21:25:39 @Oil_Guns_Merica serial murdererous windmills u vegan freaks! How do you sleep at night?
1567 2018-12-10 21:25:39 Lol it depends on the water contents  plus we were using herbs a lot back then. We knew how to extract the oil from the palm trees
1568 2018-12-10 21:25:36 Actually I found them when I was cleaning up my office. I've never used them. No idea where they came from either. Probably a gift- I rarely throw out art supplies! (See hardened tubes of oil paint from high school-took 30 years to toss 'em)
1569 2018-12-10 21:25:35 PMB has no oil block, no foreign bank account, and no houses in London, Dubai or Maryland. His properties are all in Nigeria. His 150 cows in Daura r not beyond the reach of a retired army general & former Head of State, so when you mock him wit your 1000 cows, the joke is on u.
1570 2018-12-10 21:25:28 No no no no no wrong again. It's Quebecs greed and arrogance to take billions in transfer payments created by the oil industry and simultaneously trying to destroy that same industry.
Misunderstanding? LOL
1571 2018-12-10 21:25:20 Time for people to use as little oil as possible. Burning it is bad for people’s health and the environment. Governments need to end fossil subsidies and invest in clean safe healthy transportation choices including electric buses and rail plus cycling and walking.
1572 2018-12-10 21:25:06 Also, since you mentioned you are used to smoking, we own the CBD vape brand @Hookahzz :) We carry concentrates and eliquids under that brand. The cartridges open at the top, so if you want to, you can add THC cannabis oil to them 
1573 2018-12-10 21:25:02 Why would the EU be good for an Independant Scotland? You would have to take the Euro, no veto, they would take any oil and fishing you believe you have claim to? At least you would save £15 on a visa though right!?
1574 2018-12-10 21:24:58 yeah but does anybody rlly know what motor oil tastes like??? like. ppl always compare stuff to that but i bet u good money they havent tried that shit
1575 2018-12-10 21:24:56 Not sure if oil paints are worth it anymore
1576 2018-12-10 21:24:55 There no real concessions. It’s only « Perlimpinpin Powder » (Snake Oil) 
1577 2018-12-10 21:24:49 Psa stop using coconut oil on your hair
1578 2018-12-10 21:24:48 Do you know how long it takes oil palm to become productive from planting to harvesting oil? I'm just wondering if oil palm is highest yield but for a shorter time period than others, could we remove less efficient palms and replace? Or rotate crops?
1579 2018-12-10 21:24:41 Who knew office chair gas pump oil, dust, and butt pressure over many years could form a glue with incredibly strong adhesive properties?  

Holy cow, I never thought it'd be this difficult to separate these two things.  XD
1580 2018-12-10 21:24:38 Well looks like im gonna burn all my oil and all my ships
1581 2018-12-10 21:24:24 Today's get for oil is not "stubbornly low". These bastards in OPEC keep oil prices high so they can buy their weapons of mass destruction from the Military Industrial Complex and prop up the Petrodollar.
1582 2018-12-10 21:24:17 @CWCSonichu soon CWCVILLE's oil will be mine magichan has just give me property right to 3 oil fields and an oil rig
1583 2018-12-10 21:24:02 To make the oil companies richer.
1584 2018-12-10 21:23:54 Or me. I’d pay more too. But money changes everything. Especially how we shop. The big payoff would be if oil wasn’t considered a national security thing anymore and we wouldn’t have to pay and pay for our military to keep the Middle East oil industry safe.
1585 2018-12-10 21:23:52 You found the oil in me that I couldn't find
1586 2018-12-10 21:23:51 二つ名が気になるのでーーーーーーwwwwww

ガラハド仲間にしたいなーーーーーーwwwwww
1587 2018-12-10 21:23:47 Was she always like this and I missed it? I don’t remember her being this vapid on Red Eye.
1588 2018-12-10 21:23:39 Put a halt to genocide of millions of children. 10,000/wk - cholera. Children digging in garbage dumps for scraps of food. Is Saudi oil REALLY WORTH THAT MUCH?
1589 2018-12-10 21:23:35 True. That will also bring people employed in those industries ie the oil and gas industry. When the prices fluctuate, you are stuck.
1590 2018-12-10 21:23:33 That won’t matter. If your neighbor still burns oil the planet still burns. Individuals can help. Policy can fix the problem, just like it has with other trace gases.
1591 2018-12-10 21:23:08 Stocking cap lots of oil day and night. I’m quick to take mine off too.
1592 2018-12-10 21:22:52 Big Fossil “screwing it up” = they knew this day was coming. They dabbled in being in “energy” business (i.e., REs, H2, geothermal, biofuels - plus oil & gas), but they got greedy ~20 yrs ago and doubled down on the old business. I have little sympathy w their stockholders.
1593 2018-12-10 21:22:25 Very!! The sound effects just take you into some dim lit cave filled with oil, strawberrys, chocolate, a bed of roses and a stream of warm water to soak the ora of sex in. Magical song
1594 2018-12-10 21:22:11 Dropped my car off for an oil change, said something about it to a friend he said I could’ve done that for you. I said I barely remember if I plugged my phone in at night. But I got my cases to a T.  He then processed to laugh at me.. 
1595 2018-12-10 21:22:02 Auren oil money wlh kam dole ai burauba....
1596 2018-12-10 21:21:54 As opposed to all the holier than thou UK politicians who have never fiddled expenses, had multiple jobs or lined their own pockets. Let's face it... Power corrupts. Just got to hope that your systems of checks catches at least the most corrupt.
1597 2018-12-10 21:21:39 Wow thank you so much! And would a CBD oil tincture work as well if I’m used to smoking? Or how high mg should I grab? (Looking forward to purchasing from you because I see its women owned )
1598 2018-12-10 21:21:33 Love this...”the curious thing is that 20 years ago we had 20 years worth of oil and gas, and the same was true 20 years before that, and will probably be true in 20 years time.”
1599 2018-12-10 21:21:26 This peppermint and eucalyptus oil are helping me SO much right now 
1600 2018-12-10 21:21:25 The oil boom came from the 2005 energy act that promoted development of fracking, and most of the oil boom came from private land, so it happened in spite of Obama.
1601 2018-12-10 21:21:23 Unfortunately I'm in New York. We have oil but it doesn't help me. I can't wait until the rest is legal. A friend in California sent me some and my body was completely numb.
1602 2018-12-10 21:21:16 I don’t see how they could be. Would it be illegal for a shareholder in Exxon to tell people on Twitter to buy oil? Could a shareholder in McDonalds encourage people to eat there? What about a shareholder in DeBeers encouraging people to buy diamonds? None of those are securities
1603 2018-12-10 21:21:15 リツイートしてくれる方、ありがとう
1604 2018-12-10 21:21:10 This is a classic example of the stupidity of those opposed to using CDN oil, YOU ARE STILL USING OIL. You use it every minute of everyday. If you stopped using oil altogether then you would have a point but we are decades away from that so why not buy oil from your own country?
1605 2018-12-10 21:21:08 Yeah. The u.s always had tensions. Did Russia worsen some of these? Like the one between the media and the public? Sure. But they just threw oil on an existing fire. They didn't start it. They aren't demons. Just a rival country.
1606 2018-12-10 21:21:04 Eyyah... Allah ya saka mata
1607 2018-12-10 21:21:02 Poverty is making people scoop vegetable oil out of gutters. Highly skilled MiddleClass folk are running for their lives and leaving extended family dependants stranded..

Unemployment at its peak and you think this nonsense Keyamo and Jags are saying is moving anyone out there?
1608 2018-12-10 21:20:56 Complete breakdown between oil fundamentals and oil+oil stock prices. We have reached the point of panic, apathy, and the inability to explain using logic and reason.  One of the largest energy traders in Canada: "heaviest [tax loss selling] I've ever seen." #OOTT
1609 2018-12-10 21:20:54 Steel mills and oil rigs are booming right now
1610 2018-12-10 21:20:47 it’s like wheat/potato protein, heme, and coconut oil! i think someplaces will cook it on a shared grill so maybe she got sick from that? idk i love them, but they’re sooo realistic it’s kinda scary!
1611 2018-12-10 21:20:46 @phynofino OIL 
1612 2018-12-10 21:20:42 Too bad small business owners who have to shut their doors due to shut down of Alberta oil are not illegible for EI. Trudeau wants to tax our savings as well.
1613 2018-12-10 21:20:34 Having to get an oil change by myself today bc dad couldn’t be with me and all I have to say is, I don’t like doing adult things :/
1614 2018-12-10 21:20:30 Yes girl I hope it works! Rosehip oil *** lol

Oil choke! 

1617 2018-12-10 21:20:06 I do not agree. I would not have vote to go to war , particularly with the wrong party to get oil!
1618 2018-12-10 21:20:04 yeah, it sounds pretty similar to other ppl's reactions to either the oil or the preservative. I'll ask to try the enanthate, which I think is in sesame oil instead of cottonseed. I tested allergic to sesame once, but not other times and I still eat it, so maybe that's ok??
1619 2018-12-10 21:20:02 @johngreen it's a bath thing! A bomb or oil, but I bet bomb. #dearhankandjohn
1620 2018-12-10 21:19:51 anybody need a oil change coming up? i got a coupon for a $9.99 one or $10 off premium oil change @ mr.tire and then one for a oil change plus for $24.99 that includes filter change and tire rotation or $10 off high mileage or full synthetic @ midas...
1621 2018-12-10 21:19:47 I’m realllly into a skincare phase right now. Shiseido ibuki cleanser, Summer Friday’s jet leg & overtime masks, Origins honey charchol mask, Fresh rose toner, Fresh rose hydration mask, Josie Marian Argan oil face butter
1622 2018-12-10 21:19:46 I have not used spray oil. I use butter. A friend told me she uses a pastry brush to oil hers. I bet that would work with melted butter.
1623 2018-12-10 21:19:46 It never smelled like burnt oil inside cabin tho. 

Oil leak in turbo maybe... but not smoke smell
1624 2018-12-10 21:19:37 How mad is the world for having banned such a useful plant for so long. Help.
Food, fibre, oil, all in one plant.
What were the lawmakers thinking??
1625 2018-12-10 21:19:33 Nigga put Canola Oil on the ground for that boy...
1626 2018-12-10 21:19:33 Why don't you require  Nigeria, Iraq & Kazakhstan to have this "social license"? Why don't you examine the true environmental impact of importing oil from these horrible counties? Why are you supporting global warming?
1627 2018-12-10 21:19:31 If he is on call 24/7 for his kid or kids, yep.
1628 2018-12-10 21:19:27 gotta get some coconut oil for my gym bag. I'm out here living like a peasant.
1629 2018-12-10 21:19:23 things i need to do: get an oil change
things i don’t want to do: get an oil change
1630 2018-12-10 21:19:22 If you've looking for a low-key evergreen holiday gift for friends who cook a lot, may I suggest: fancy ass vanilla extract and good olive oil.
1631 2018-12-10 21:19:20 Really really really gutted about your announcement that Labour will pour billions of Uk taxes into north sea oil corporation coffers. Whilst Westminster fixates on Murdoch's Brexit debacle. the planet burns. #ExtinctionRebellion Dec 21st BBC HQ 10.30am
1632 2018-12-10 21:19:11 It's always those who are no oil paintings themselves who criticise the appearance of others.
1633 2018-12-10 21:19:09 With incompetents such as Martin negotiating (fixed price contracts) this possibility was high, oil and gas man sidesteps gas option what exactly was he hired for then?
1634 2018-12-10 21:18:56 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
1635 2018-12-10 21:18:54 Trudeau's liberals have contributed heavily to crushing our oil industry.
1636 2018-12-10 21:18:47 Taxing the oil companies won’t help. They would simply pass the tax onto consumers. It would be the same as a tariff.
1637 2018-12-10 21:18:45 @Alex_S_Cullen awe can't handle the idea that ghg and climate change is global not in your Canadian bubble and Canadian o n g would help displace dirtier oil from other nations. Thanks for blocking me! I am honoured. Why is it that many on the left can't handle truth and facts?
1638 2018-12-10 21:18:43 #Scotland.Has 60% of EU's untapped oil.Creates more renewable energy than its population can use. 
Yet as we don't have the powers of an Independent nation,
#Scotland suffers 27% of its population using #foodbanks(fig. PreUC-rollout)& 20,000 deaths nationally over the last 3 yrs.
1639 2018-12-10 21:18:43 Typically CBD oil provides mental clairity with the THC high. If you would like to get a feel for it, take the THC first, then start low on the CBD, and layer the effects up. If you are dosing them more than about 3-4 hours apart I don't think they'll interact.
1640 2018-12-10 21:18:40 Didn't have enough oil to cover them all so I did kinda make half croutons half tiny toast
1641 2018-12-10 21:18:33 Car is sold. 

Buyer said the turbo was leaking oil. 

He bought it anyways. I didn’t want to cause it seemed fishy. We started the car 3 times over the past 2 days and not a single sign of smoke smell in car cabin but as soon as he started driving 

Burn smell
1642 2018-12-10 21:18:33 Most Nigerians don’t really know the work these Administration is doings so hard to stop “oil theft “ in the previous govt we hear in news how many barrels of oil we lost as a Nation everyday.

1645 2018-12-10 21:18:10 Hey, I’m still waiting for that photo of your VW van covered with solar panels.... no? (PS I would support oil companies using some profit to aid environment endeavours).
1646 2018-12-10 21:18:04 I do an oil cleanse first (Argan, avacado, and tea tree oil), wash with black soap, tone with witch hazel (the kind with no alcohol), face mask w turmeric and apple cider vinegar and I have a vitamin e moisturizer.
1647 2018-12-10 21:18:02 I need my ends clipped, and a hot oil treatment
1648 2018-12-10 21:17:58 Warm olive oil in a pan and chop up some garlic and put it in it then let it simmer and then cool and put it on a cotton ball thennnn put it in your ear.
1649 2018-12-10 21:17:58 Did you know that some vegan cheeses contain palm oil?
1650 2018-12-10 21:17:52 It's just...some of the richest people and brightest minds - medical and otherwise have died of cancer. Do people really think if concentrated weed oil and Vitamin B were the solution those folks didn't think of it already.
1651 2018-12-10 21:17:49 Ruth Davidson's Scottish Conservatives backed REMAIN to a man /woman/ self designating. and also went along with this ludicrous Euro linguistic programming. Scots Tories are the SNP light and  will sell out our fishing & oil to EU
1652 2018-12-10 21:17:48 I asked Santa to bring me 2 books, Dark Money and oil's Deep State
1653 2018-12-10 21:17:40 twin funny dab his teacher said “what’s another word for oil” this nigga said lean
1654 2018-12-10 21:17:38 The SNP massively inflated North Sea oil revenues during the independence referendum. If Scotland had voted for independence would you supported a 2nd vote on the basis of your providing inaccurate figures or would you consider it undemocratic?
1655 2018-12-10 21:17:29 I tell Daquan take the car go get a oil change WHY AM I IN THE CAR!!  like the point was for me not to go
1656 2018-12-10 21:17:27 Never pop no xan i been on oil
1657 2018-12-10 21:17:25 No, not wrong. Different studies reaching different conclusions. All your studies have been debunked though. Going vegan means people in poor countries starve as their produce and grains fetch too high a price as exports. Mexico makes more of avacados than oil.
1658 2018-12-10 21:17:22 Markets barely Green
Oil came off 3℅ to 50 bucks again
No releif at the pump yet

1667 2018-12-10 21:16:41 Only a miracle can save the Oil. Many had some hope for OPEC to save them that was only disappointment. Soon $45 can be tested.
1668 2018-12-10 21:16:37 We fell in love with an angel with 8 large wings lining its entire back, made of oil. It gave us a pair of sneakers whose soles are falling off.
1669 2018-12-10 21:16:33 Lost as a result of the previous 44 years of conservative Govt who didn’t protect the industry with more royalties, proper taxation and if there’s a 3 year glut of opec oil on the market didn’t demand a higher price for our oil.  They also didn’t get additional pipelines built
1670 2018-12-10 21:16:30 He is not wrong... 
France never really recovered from the oil crisis in 1973... and since the first socialist government in 1981, things have been spiralling down. And public spending has skyrocketed: 57% of GDP today. 
Nevertheless, Macron is part of the problem.   
1671 2018-12-10 21:16:20 Hatta bu durum oil curse diye geçer :)

I can sip on a pot of it.

1679 2018-12-10 21:15:53 Answer the question about the $260 billion in unpaid clean up costs for which private oil interests have not paid and Canadian taxpayers will. The "environmental oversight" on these projects existed only as a figleaf. No one has the funds or a plan to clean up, and you want MORE?
1680 2018-12-10 21:15:47 Climate change is real. The science and the evidence is incontrovertible. We need a huge carbon tax—just one that targets the rich oil companies and not the poor taxi or Uber driver.
1681 2018-12-10 21:15:46 How is using Saudi oil better for the environment? By the way every time you fill your gas tank you help fund Saudi atrocities.
1682 2018-12-10 21:15:42 Trudeau can’t win without Quebec in next election. That province has just been bought. Maybe Quebec could give up everything that has oil in lt.
1683 2018-12-10 21:15:40 Our massive oil reserves would turn Alberta into one of the wealthiest countries in the world exporting to Canada and US. Taxes could be eliminated entirely or reduced significantly and high standard of living would attract talent from the world. I don’t see a lot of downside
1684 2018-12-10 21:15:20 It doesn't actually mention 'supporting' the oil and gas industry in the article.
1685 2018-12-10 21:15:17 Jama'a kunun Aya to the world
1686 2018-12-10 21:15:07 You've never even stepped foot in Cold Lake but you will "keep standing up for Cold Lake". First the oil industry and now this. Lies and more lies
1687 2018-12-10 21:15:04 We are the first generation to see the return of snake oil sales"people".
1688 2018-12-10 21:14:58 We don’t have to try she’s already a joke
1689 2018-12-10 21:14:56 Jx ate oil rice mood dear
1690 2018-12-10 21:14:48 It literally says nowhere in the article about it 'supporting' the oil and gas industry?
1691 2018-12-10 21:14:47 Bread and Egg sellers should start soaking the bread in oil and fry it so that it gets more crunchier. What kind of dry bread too is this?
1692 2018-12-10 21:14:45 No. Even if we nationalize all the oil&coal corps and switch to renewables. We still can't keep consuming as much. It simply isn't sustainable.

1697 2018-12-10 21:14:05 for someone in the industry you dont seem to know very much about it.  If switching to LEDs costs billions & reduces energy consumption by up to 90%, thats a better way of Labour spending billions instead of giving it to oil corporations!!  #ExtinctionRebellion 21st Dec BBC HQ

1699 2018-12-10 21:13:57 so... I was supposed to be at work at 4 but nope. Tim was changing my oil. Ended up tightning it, couldn't get it off.. had to wait for my brother-in-law to get there with the tool. Finally got it off.. to find out I got the wrong oil filter BECAUSE
1700 2018-12-10 21:13:56 Great news? Bench warmer at Cheque Book FC.  Oil money ruining English football and footballers since 2014..
1701 2018-12-10 21:13:56 Pathological liar and snake oil salesman Ed Martin can not be trusted with the truth - can we get this piece of works severance back or sue the Nalcor BoD that handed out the golden parachute?
1702 2018-12-10 21:13:46 It can help, but by itself...there's no scientist that's not taking big oil money telling you that in and of itself it will do anything more than prolong the inevitable and most likely not even for as long as they imagine.
1703 2018-12-10 21:13:44 US oil companies join Saudi, Kuwait, and Russian oil companies to protest language in Paris Climate Aggreement. Rosneft needs a new pony

1705 2018-12-10 21:13:26 Nice. I can only assume then that he would be all in for the government not subsidizing the oil and gas industry then. I mean, for the sake of true freedom and all that.
1706 2018-12-10 21:13:13 Shower n baby oil? Slip sliding away. Get well.
1707 2018-12-10 21:13:13 @Melissavoice That you voicing about the oil rig-lifting ship Pioneering Spirit? Gripping stuff.

1710 2018-12-10 21:13:02 That’s the oil field life pa
1711 2018-12-10 21:12:54 Everyone is different, but after doing much more than people around me, it helps to think big picture. For me, that resulted in what I consider an epiphany. Oil companies need a lot of help to go out of business; they won’t do it on their own, no matter how much change happens.
1712 2018-12-10 21:12:52 So I assume you were outraged when Trump called a gold star father a liar, and mocked a war hero?
1713 2018-12-10 21:12:46 A conman just like Trump. The GOP is a group of con artist and their supports keeping buying their snake oil.
1714 2018-12-10 21:12:41 Ask me anything about cannabis oil you like. It will help me complete my cannabis oil page on the website. Anything that I use will be published with your question and a credit by name. This is your opportunity to pitch in and perhaps be a part of our project.
1715 2018-12-10 21:12:37 @realDonaldTrump Looks like  Arabs are going to get their way our oil producers cannot produce when price is below cost of production. Refineries shut down, oil fields lay off workers. Gas at a low price is this the way to build our Nation? We sell ArabsMunitions is this worth it
1716 2018-12-10 21:12:33 Gap down open. ...??? INDU 50 DMA CROSS 200 SOON...OIL plunges deeper in bear territory
1717 2018-12-10 21:12:31 Yeah, wrecking a pipeline full of oil or whatever that will spill all over the place will be GREAT for the environment!  Crazy and dumb people of all beliefs!
1718 2018-12-10 21:12:30 I still need to get an oil change lmao why am I so lazy 
1719 2018-12-10 21:12:23 NS oil is already UK owned, its Scottish & you can't rely on that income because Scotland may secede as it voted to remain. 

Easier to make trade deals? UK doesn't make anything to sell & it is likely to lose a significant portion of its largest export, City income from EU trade
1720 2018-12-10 21:12:17 Last week I was meant to have faith in a mechanic that burnt his hand on the oil dipstick of my car that had just been turned off. 

That's it. That's my tweet. 
1721 2018-12-10 21:12:15 Oil countries.
1722 2018-12-10 21:12:14 Yes.
1723 2018-12-10 21:12:09 Still don’t get why companies walk free after cutting down acres of trees and dropping tonnes of oil into our oceans but we have to drink out of paper straws UMMMMMM
1724 2018-12-10 21:12:04 Manifest destiny. Before oil, it was coal powering railroads, allowing us to take control from sea to sea like god intended. Technology has brought us great things, but we don’t consider the cost until we’re overdrawn.
1725 2018-12-10 21:12:01 2/2 A nation which can't see forest for the trees, always blaming others rather fixing one's own short comings - what could be expected. During honey, and oil and enjoy life.
1726 2018-12-10 21:12:01 Quebec refineries don’t buy Saudi oil.
1727 2018-12-10 21:11:52 I hope that the vehicle leaves an oil stain.
1728 2018-12-10 21:11:49 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
1729 2018-12-10 21:11:33 Obviously Quebec has a better understanding of the ENVIRONMENT which is way more important that any oil.

1731 2018-12-10 21:11:18 So it’s the opposite of how it works with the ladies? Women who taste like a classic Arby’s roast beef smothered in Arby’s sauce + Horsey sauce are my fave. Or a good spicy Tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil
1732 2018-12-10 21:11:12 Brutal. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. I am so caned.

1737 2018-12-10 21:10:58 It's funny how you thought machines wouldn't need maintenance. With 57,636 turbines supplying 8% of our energy needs requiring only 10^-5 of the oil required for a rig, the e.r.o.i. is still a safer bet.
1738 2018-12-10 21:10:51 Also i am excited to be a cleanup the likes of which is drawing vast quantities of dirty oil from tar sands.

1747 2018-12-10 21:10:16 Marijuana oil and vitamin b is not going to do anything to change the nature of  cancerous stem cells being able to engage in angiogenesis, reactivating the telomerase enzyme therefore making them immortal, and not needing to be firmly attached to a base to grow.
1748 2018-12-10 21:10:14 it's why i emphasise the mechanical work of oil as an impact, when you think of the sheer size, you realize that the amount of oil used in this slow-motion explosion since the industrial revolution used about a tenth of the energy of the impact that ended the Cretaceous
1749 2018-12-10 21:10:12 Saudi oil doesn’t go to Quebec refineries anymore.  Mostly American, Canadian, and Nigerian.

1754 2018-12-10 21:09:50 Oil companies push renewables because their variablility locks in fossil fuel as backup forever.  They are only afraid of nuclear but green groups are their biggest ally in this fight.

1758 2018-12-10 21:09:35 I agree with this; the fandango of big oil & big coal interests talking about 'innovation' & 'entrepreneurship' & not mentioning catastrophe at a climate conference whilst gently pickling in the polluted air of Katowice is laughable
1759 2018-12-10 21:09:34 They get most of their oil from the Middle East today.  The war will be over "Who still gets to heat their homes after the Saudi-Iranian war cuts shipments out of the Middle East in half?"
1760 2018-12-10 21:09:20 Can we refine our own oil yet?
1761 2018-12-10 21:09:03 That's just stupid. Surely you're not suggesting that lubricating oil is a significant portion of fossil fuel consumption.
It's clear that the majority of oil production goes into transportation fuels. Those get burnt. Poof. Cloud of smoke. Gone. Try to recycle that.

1763 2018-12-10 21:08:42 Tbh, I chose to pay for my oil changes/maintenance in my car note because I thought it’d be a tad bit more convenient but @Ford has proven me SO WRONG.
1764 2018-12-10 21:08:33 'Your disciples'- have you got a god complex- I feel sorry for people who for 'snake oil' sales men like you.
1765 2018-12-10 21:08:27 Stand in front of a diesel truck exhast and tell it's me ok to breath. 
Oils good for making plastics , why burn it when wind power Is free?  Besides when fusion is working there will little need for oil.
1766 2018-12-10 21:08:27 The Alberta oil and gas industry didn't get serious until Leduc No. 1 in 1947.
1767 2018-12-10 21:08:26 if you are thinking oil price remember OECD, World Bank, IMF, EIA, HMT, OBR and others had individual forecast prices of oil between $90 and $120 a barrel 2014 - 2018
1768 2018-12-10 21:08:21 @realDonaldTrump My 71yr old mother told me to tell you she worked for years on an government oil reserve as security, carried a 12 gage 356 Mag, trained on military army base, wore government issued clothing, therefore would she too be considered a veteran?
1769 2018-12-10 21:08:20 The oil companies are the byproducts of our narcissistic pursuit for immediate gratification. There’s no question there’s a feedback loop but, without the initial impetus, we would have very different environmental goals.

1783 2018-12-10 21:07:22 If you support the Democratic establishment you support corruption. The D3C is controlled by donors and lobbyists representing Wall Street, Pharma and Big Oil.

$DXY +1% off the low to 97.20 (3rd highest close in 2018)
Indian Ruppee -1.5% collapsing again
Yuan above 6.90 again
DAX -1.5%

1791 2018-12-10 21:06:51 What food to bring to the field?
1. Ham and cheese sandwich? But vegan options would be a more sustainable
2. Peanut butter w jam? But palm oil used + creating more garbage
3. Self-made black bean spread? But negative effects on bowel movements
4. Nothing? But starvation fear

1806 2018-12-10 21:05:50 Yep...a carnival barking snake oil salesman who promotes himself by bullying, distracting, outright lying, and trying to belittle. His act is so old to everyone but his sycophant cult.

1816 2018-12-10 21:05:00 ok... I've given you 100 studies and links to videos where doctors, patients, scientists talk about PRACTICE with cannabis oil. that's not an article, that's not mice, that's humans. plus a link to testimonies of about 50 people whose stories you can all check
1817 2018-12-10 21:04:52 I was more thinking that Big Fossils r gonna screw it up, go bankrupt while we still need some oil and gas, have sooo much liability that no one will buy them, and we’ll end up w a mutant sort of Resolution Trust Corp.
1818 2018-12-10 21:04:43 2015/16= We Have Cancelled Subsidy That Is Why Fuel Increase From #97 To #145

1826 2018-12-10 21:03:16 Yes, I purchased CBD oil from Spectrum (Canopy)....totally useless. I am having it tested.
1827 2018-12-10 21:03:11 Lol. So the oil shock never happened. And it's a complete coincidence that in Europe gas taxes are much higher and people drive much less (and they buy smaller cars, with are more fuel efficient).

1837 2018-12-10 21:02:23 It implies that the couple should stay inside, much like the Jews had to when the Hanukkah oil miraculously burned for 8 days. However it corrupts the spiritual message with the implication of pre marital sex and promotes pagan anti-Semitic heathenism.

1850 2018-12-10 21:01:29 They are trapped in their own agenda and will do everything to preserve their interest. But the EV transformation that @Tesla is leading cannot be stopped. Business interests of mainstream media and their big auto/oil face existential threat if they fail to join the EV movement.
1851 2018-12-10 21:01:18 How does it make sense for rich oil companies to plunder Earth’s natural resources, poison the climate, and make record profits while we place a carbon tax on the working poor? Tax the rich oil barons who created the problem and subsidize electric cars for mass consumer.

1854 2018-12-10 21:01:06 Poked holes how? By making a spurious, entirely inaccurate point that oil construction projects involve no environmental oversight, and then proposing that there’s no way they ever could? That’s a pinprick at best.
1855 2018-12-10 21:00:59 Gaan lick palm oil
1856 2018-12-10 21:00:55 There should also be no “social acceptability” for Saskatchewan people to write a $500 Million cheque to Canadians that prefer to buy foreign oil rather than domestic oil.  @PremierScottMoe ...  can we let that cheque bounce?
1857 2018-12-10 21:00:50 175 mil ppl benefit from oil & resources who invest in nyse due2aramco... can I kindly & genuinely speak on this: war benefits all politicians & stock investors & even people. Bush invaded 2 countries. Obama did 7. NO JUDGMENT to either... war is neutral lol

1870 2018-12-10 20:59:51 My hair does exactly that too... apparently the natural oil from the roots reduces frizz, with is what makes it crazy wavy in the first place. I never leave it like that, but even a little humidity is a bitch, and often a bun or ponytail is the best. Or a ton of styling product.
1871 2018-12-10 20:59:49 I thought the federal government was the leader and highest power in this country. Just pass the laws and put the oil through the pipelines. Enough with the protests and delays, we as a country need this done until a more viable ckean option is available.
1872 2018-12-10 20:59:49 Did you hear how boofing CBD oil improves cognitive responses and decreases anxiety! Ommggg I gotta try it!!
1873 2018-12-10 20:59:47 Not certain fracking is the answer but we do need to get our Canadian oil coming east.
1874 2018-12-10 20:59:42 No; of course not. Because... reasons.
1875 2018-12-10 20:59:41 That oil giving you eczema
1876 2018-12-10 20:59:30 You know, in October of 1973, when Arab oil producers cut off oil supplies to countries that support Israel and King Faisal said, "We and our ancestors survived in the desert on dates and milk and we are willing to return to them again if we have to.”

That’s big D energy!!
1877 2018-12-10 20:59:20 It seems I'm having panic attack symptoms, and I don't go to therapy/ psyquiatrist in years.. I'm thinking trying with cannabis oil until I come back from my travel u~u hope it helps..my hands can't stop sweating and my heart pounds like crazy in a random way latey

1880 2018-12-10 20:58:50 No cheese or meat. Only flaxseed or extra virgin olive oil & no frying with either. No dairy at all. I can have fish, most veggies & fruit. No coconut though. Mostly I try to concentrate on what I can have, not what I can't and mostly I get on OK with it. I do feel a lot better!
1881 2018-12-10 20:58:38 1 Billion? their unbalance take of Equalization payments is more than a billion. The government is in trouble with debt. The morons elected a government who mission statement was to close the oil industry
1882 2018-12-10 20:58:25 Agreed, I have had a pair for 6 years now, just replace the heels and oil them up once a year. Also don’t wear them in the water or cow shit

1884 2018-12-10 20:58:12 I did a coconut oil hair mask and forgot to wash twice. I’m slimy.
1885 2018-12-10 20:58:08 Ummm only now the economist realized Petrol retailers are ripping us off? I’ve been saying this for years!!! Oil prices has been low in fact much lower compare to 20 years ago but the fuel prices keeps going up for now particular good reason except profits for petrol retailers.
1886 2018-12-10 20:58:01 So it can be done sustainably using organic ingredients that ensure animal welfare, don't use pesticides on the land, support local business, protect wildlife and taste delicious. Why use palm oil in the first place?
1887 2018-12-10 20:57:58 Remember when kathy tried to cook bacon and put oil in the pan and salted the bacon
1888 2018-12-10 20:57:54 Amazing!
Wait until you try out the new Refresh Beard Oil.  You're going to love it!
1889 2018-12-10 20:57:53 Not smart of enough to realize the country does not approve of Tech morals. Somehow Morals and Tech just doesn't go together. They are like oil and water on a good day.

1892 2018-12-10 20:57:35 The squeaky wheel gets the oil . Social media tell everyone to register a complaint on the rt side of screen mark down the rating stars to 1 or zero. 54 days it gets worse as it goes on unless they receive the same headaches we have.
1893 2018-12-10 20:57:35 Correct. 40 minutes at 50°c. Then raging hot cast iron with a little oil then butter at the end. Perfect

Some facilities are better than others but almost all are worse than oil

1900 2018-12-10 20:56:58 I just accidentally took melatonin instead of fish oil happy Monday
1901 2018-12-10 20:56:53 We always had oil, government choose to stop producing to get Saudi oil first.  Got trapped by greedy payoffs.
1902 2018-12-10 20:56:50 You are a silly woman who quotes JK Rowlings - you no nothing about economics - it is not about the price of oil, it is about HOW the oil is paid for globally -
1903 2018-12-10 20:56:50 It’s really funny though that “oil money and gold AKs” made you all automatically assume Iraqi and yet you’re saying I’m offensive lmao

1906 2018-12-10 20:55:55 @PharmaHempCplx I have a question about cbd oil was wondering if you could help me out?
1907 2018-12-10 20:55:55 Girl I just gave mine a new set, oil change & oil gasket and new battery.. I’m not about to go out and make more damage. Nov was nothing but car issues and fixes.
1908 2018-12-10 20:55:54 2) high wages and royalties the oil industry pays? Couldn't disagree with you more and we ain't never gonna agree
1909 2018-12-10 20:55:44 1) Jesus, really? You don't see the hypocrisy in their position? While tankers carrying Saudi oil come up the ST Lawrence, and deposit the cargo at Mtl refineries, then says, no social acceptability for oil in Que but will take $13 Bil mostly from taxes AB's pay because of the
1910 2018-12-10 20:55:39 People say "put a carbon tax on it", but it's not that simple when emissions come from different parts of the value chain and aren't always tracked. It's not just about carbon content of fuel, it's about how we turn crude oil into that fuel.
1911 2018-12-10 20:55:31 Soup that I don't see oil in it is a big turn off for me. I don't know people eat soup without seeing a little bit of oil in it
1912 2018-12-10 20:55:29 They trying to say my issue shouldn’t be blamed because they did a oil change. I’m like bitxh nothing was wrong with my car before I went: then all this shit happen the night of. They was the last ones to go under my hood
1913 2018-12-10 20:55:14 I'm ashamed to be a quebecer. How can Quebec be so selfish?  They take the ''dirty oil'' money while spitting on Alberta.  Worst part is that they gloat about surplus in their budget.  Almost blood money.

1915 2018-12-10 20:55:08 A shot of olive oil a day is all you need!!!
1916 2018-12-10 20:55:00 where’s ur anointing oil?
1917 2018-12-10 20:54:59 Yes all those things are considerations, we pay dearly for our oil in other ways (disasters, healthcare, etc) not at the pump, and if you honestly believe that oil production results in better global security than your world view isn't just simple it's wrong.
1918 2018-12-10 20:54:55 ‘Coherent’ you say?... explain the oil estimate oversight then?
1919 2018-12-10 20:54:53 yet you won't stop buying oil from the Saudis on teh basis of their actions against human rights .... oh but wait .....you might have to be pro Canadians oil.... and Trudeau would never do that.....Trudeau is all fluff and no stuff

1923 2018-12-10 20:54:26 When the allowed female drivrrs of POVs and you meet wives of oil company workers from the the 70s through the the 2000s and what MBS did on prositution.60 ,min investigation.90s
1924 2018-12-10 20:54:24 Let me add one more complexity. The emissions from crude oil vary A LOT depending on the oil's composition, how it's discovered, how it's extracted, and how it's refined. We explore these questions in our ongoing analysis of the Oil Climate Index.
1925 2018-12-10 20:53:50 Suncor Montreal is one of the largest industrial facilities in Canada. And has supported that region, to its core, for MANY decades. There is no leg to stand on to say there is no social license for oil in Quebec.
1926 2018-12-10 20:53:35 At the eye clinic and a mother of a 6 year old just walked by and said “I started her on cbd oil”.

Now I’m all about it being used on children in severe issues.... but in general practice.... where do we stand on CBD oils being used on children?

1929 2018-12-10 20:53:18 Homemade remedy

¼ cup almond oil 
5 drops helichrysum
15 drops lavender
15 drops juniper berry
15 drops cypress
2 oz amber glass dropper bottle 
Cotton ball or Q-Tip

Rub this on the rim of your ears, behind ears, along the eustachian tube, ear lobes, sides of neck and temples.
1930 2018-12-10 20:53:11 Are you referencing the antitrust laws on monopolies? Because while there is no standard oil anymore it became Exxon, Mobile, ConocoPhillips, Texaco, and many other still privately owned oil companies

Moisturize and add little vaseline. Wear socks over your palms, go to bed.

1936 2018-12-10 20:52:41 Put a drop of lemongrass oil in my hair product today and I feel like a walking garden 
1937 2018-12-10 20:52:41 Venezuela has oil, Iran has oil(remember the West led a coup there to put the Shah in power)
Saudi Arabia is part and parcel of western colonialism and greed. No amount of oil is an excuse for the US to support such an oppressive state.
1938 2018-12-10 20:52:40 F**k that female dog.  Sorry to offend my canine friends, but you know what I meant
1939 2018-12-10 20:52:39 Seriously? No one is going to talk about how many birds I can kill with a shotgun?
1940 2018-12-10 20:52:38 The continued siege of the coalition forces led to a crisis in oil derivatives, which negatively impacted the performance of media institutions and prevented many of them from continuing #اليوم_العالمي_لحقوق_الإنسان
1941 2018-12-10 20:52:38 they change often but this is: 1 mielle white peony leave in conditioner 2 pantene gold series curl defining pudding 3 coconut oil
1942 2018-12-10 20:52:37 That's very nice of Putin. I'm sure he did that out of the goodness of his heart.

But Venezuelan crude is so heavy that it needs to be diluted with lighter oil to be able to refine it. Lighter oil that has to be imported. And they have been having problems paying for the imports
1943 2018-12-10 20:52:37 He obviously doesn’t know much. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for SAD+it works for meHave you heard/tried that?
1944 2018-12-10 20:52:36 coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
1945 2018-12-10 20:52:35 It actually caters to both Bleeding Heart Socialists & Capitalists. Its actually a win win. U can have that if our province is keeping all their damn Resouce Revenue! But the Socialists in Alberta care to much about the anti oil idiots out east & in every other shithole #ABEXIT
1946 2018-12-10 20:52:35 If it’s Irving Oil who imports from Saudi, are you picking winners and losers in Canada’s oil industry? Telling Irving that they should buy more expensive & harder to refine oil seems to say that you expect them to take a loss. I thought you Cons were all about the free market?
1947 2018-12-10 20:52:31 N she's proud of what momma does to put food on the table(pun intended). 
You are a true Igbo girl. Oil dey ur head
1948 2018-12-10 20:52:28 Quebec City should not be allowed to even ask for an NHL team until Quebec stops buying Saudi oil.

1952 2018-12-10 20:52:12 Support is what Dems need, they already have strong voting records on environment according to @LCVoters  I worked for a Dem Veteran whose wife was a teacher, he was willing to do the right thing on environment but the GOP oil backed candidate won. Dems needs support!
1953 2018-12-10 20:52:03 Perhaps we are better off on our own...strategic location, highly educated, massive oil reserves 
1954 2018-12-10 20:52:02 Countries £2trillion debt, paying these thousands of CEO’s directors, a fortune to live in their mansions in the ‘Home Counties’. These people are not for Scotland just the oil and gas reserves which funded them for a while until they started to get really greedy
1955 2018-12-10 20:52:01 I need a full body massage with warm oil
1956 2018-12-10 20:51:59 I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for SAD+it works for meHave you heard/tried that?
1957 2018-12-10 20:51:57 I think it's fine that Quebec refuses Alberta Oil. I also think it's fine that B.C. refuses increased access to its coastline for oil exports. I also think it's fine for Alberta to decide this isn't working and consider all alternatives within and beyond confederation. #cdnpoli
1958 2018-12-10 20:51:55 Integrity Iniative? Is your office in the Statecraft empty warehouse? Are you a recipient of part of Treason Mays 100 million pounds of OUR taxpayers money? Stop peddling snake oil. Get another job.
1959 2018-12-10 20:51:37 And 'renewables' are only renewable as long as you have oil, and a FF backup system

1964 2018-12-10 20:51:07 Thank you Connie - I find the fact that palm oil was a rarity & almost unheard of 2 decades ago but now appears in almost every product in a supermarket odd.
1965 2018-12-10 20:51:06 I also grabbed that oil perfume from lush that smells like jasmine and now I'm in heaven
1966 2018-12-10 20:51:03 Both BTC and ETH are money. ETH however was sold the the public as some kind of "digital oil" utility token. It's useless for any other use case outside of money. As money it is inferior to BTC. Why would you hold that funny money?
1967 2018-12-10 20:50:51 My azur lane ships warned me that they're going to be overflowing with oil. In that case I should be allowed to start an energy company 
1968 2018-12-10 20:50:33 Quebec contributes nothing to the Canadian economy. They have no factories or manufacturing to explain such enormous use of petroleum. It's all the poutine fried in oil that is draining the pipeline, and they know nothing about cooking so they dine out eating oily fastfood. greed
1969 2018-12-10 20:50:29 Try lavender oil!!!! Helps with itches
1970 2018-12-10 20:50:26 A nice rally off the lows. But oil and the banks can’t continue having large swings into the abyss.
1971 2018-12-10 20:50:20 Well that would be your opinion if you have a vested interest with shipping and oil transportation buisness. Either way burning oil still pollutes and is harmful to health.
1972 2018-12-10 20:50:10 I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for SAD+it works for meHave you heard/tried that?

1980 2018-12-10 20:49:43 Yea.  We will build you an oil pipeline for free if you take in our socialists.
1981 2018-12-10 20:49:33 I don’t think any can predict what replacements, if any, will be best. What all non-denial plans have in common is that they put oil companies out of business. Until we clear a path, by putting the first oil company out of business, we will not know how to proceed.
1982 2018-12-10 20:49:23 Massive oil reserves, highly educated workforce...we would be one of the wealthiest and most successful countries immediately.

1984 2018-12-10 20:49:03 Oh hell I never thought of that. I've been in there many times to get an oil change and I never thought of that! I hope you put it on a special code so they can't undo it easily. This really gave me great joy hahaha
1985 2018-12-10 20:48:47 I'm opposed to Quebec commercial vehicles using Canadian roads and using any form of oil and gas, only electric helicopters for them.
1986 2018-12-10 20:48:46 First day is wraps and  my hands smell like dough and vegetable oil
1987 2018-12-10 20:48:39 Be talking bout yo total $349  no it ain’t take all dat shit  off leave that $30 oil change
1988 2018-12-10 20:48:35 Donald Trump insulted a Gold Star Family and you elected him.  He insulted John McCain and you elected.  Foh with that.

1992 2018-12-10 20:48:23 ‘New’ Labour, I think you mean?  Jeremy is opposed to killing innocent people for oil
1993 2018-12-10 20:48:20 I recorded a video on $OIL $CL_F today that is more educational rather than a forecast but it does have a possible forecast in it. Anyone who is trades Oil, or trades Elliott wave, or just wants to learn some stuff I highly recommend watching this. I think many of you will enjoy.
1994 2018-12-10 20:48:16 I put some tea tree oil in that jawn 1 time and I had a whole new face
1995 2018-12-10 20:48:15 I’m convinced niggas just tryna make it seem like you playing them cause they doing it Hoe You slick But you ain’t Slicker than Me I’m Baby Oil 
1996 2018-12-10 20:48:02 No one wants oil....People need to see the inventories down several weeks in a row.
1997 2018-12-10 20:47:50 No worries, Putin just promised 6 billion to Maduro. There will be plenty of everything for the Russians like air strips and de facto control of Venezuela's dwindling oil production.
1998 2018-12-10 20:47:46 @SafetyNicaragua We had a young couple from France as guests in our hostel in Rivas. In Leon a guy changed the oil in their car for $100 USD, the police laughed. In Granada their car was broken into, shattered the glass and stole over $100 Euros and much more .. welcome visitors
1999 2018-12-10 20:47:44 Every President in the Past promised energy independence from Middle East Oil .. Trump delivers!!
no more war for oil .. whose mad??
2000 2018-12-10 20:47:33 Tell that to big oil.

2002 2018-12-10 20:47:32 Mct oil got me thinking sharp
2003 2018-12-10 20:47:25 You were bullish oil in your pinned tweet mate

2005 2018-12-10 20:47:17 I hate going to get an oil change at the shop bruh them muh fuckas alwAys tryina well you some filters..fuck th filters change my damn oil
2006 2018-12-10 20:47:12 It was to keep oil prices in check before mid-term elections.
2007 2018-12-10 20:47:10 Our entire culture is based around the pursuit of a lavish standard of living and wasted space and the freedom to travel or have stuff delivered and the fuel consumption necessary to make it all work, and that's a bigger problem than any oil company shenanigans.
2008 2018-12-10 20:47:02 We fund co’s that care nothing about mankind when we pay our cable bill, our phone bill, buy from stores. Stop funding the enemies of green energy. Vote with your wallet. Defund oil co’s & co’s that fund corruption & $300B oil subsidies. @elonmusk @mayemusk
2009 2018-12-10 20:46:54 If oil stays here above $50 usd , why want it to stop lmao ??? If $PPR.ca goes to 10 cents that's a gift, mortgage the house, Sell the kids, and go BALLS DEEP!!! Terminal value is 0.60 cents +++ we adding more on a discount. Amazing , maybe 0.18 tmr I'll add again
2010 2018-12-10 20:46:44 “let me get you a drink. A yo bartender! Let me get a ciroc for the young lady and some tea tree oil for my beard” @TonyBakercomedy is a whole fool

2012 2018-12-10 20:46:38 CBD oil too. I know several people that use it to help them sleep, calm down / anxiety... relax etc
2013 2018-12-10 20:46:36 And more importantly it's not about revamping the country rather its about improving the economy because we have to increase our exports and cut the cost of already refined oil that we buy worth $4-5b ! That's all ...
2014 2018-12-10 20:46:35 Really? I can cook and if u turn to foodstuff i will cook u. I love veg oil more dan palm oil
2015 2018-12-10 20:46:22 hooo yeah, damn! i’m noticing a lot of redness clustered under the beard, too. i’m thinking this might be too astringent for you for one thing, if it’s a foaming cleanser it can strip the oil from your face and the friction of the soap and your hands can cause irritation.
2016 2018-12-10 20:46:21 A good olive oil with an aged balsamic vinegar can be pretty healthy and tasty.
2017 2018-12-10 20:46:17 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2018 2018-12-10 20:46:17 Every time I get an oil change they try to sell me some other bullsh*t 
2019 2018-12-10 20:46:08 So now we are selling our souls for oil? Or should I say still?
2020 2018-12-10 20:45:59 White people smell like milk, black people smell like coconut oil, etc. Only brown people actually smell fucking terrible though
2021 2018-12-10 20:45:54 skimmed milk powder + Palm Oil Powder = milk powder gibi bir durum var dünyada. Bisküvilerin içinde süt kreması, dondurmada süt tozu, nutellada süt bilmmenesi denilen şey bu. Isıl işlem görünce kanserojen hale gelen şey.
2022 2018-12-10 20:45:52 Dude Luna oil is the best ever! But don’t use it unless you’re prepared to fall in and spend $100+ when you need to restock it
2023 2018-12-10 20:45:48 Found in Bigg's "Hedgehogging": It took US equity markets 16 years to reach the peak performance it had in 1966. Oil scares and rising rates contributed-- but rates were in response to double digit (!!) inflation. The result? A 16 year real return of ~-90%! All about timing...

2033 2018-12-10 20:44:49 avocado oil  
2034 2018-12-10 20:44:46 Low quality, sliced, Store bought bread. “real mayonnaise” (store bought, probably soybean oil based). Looks good, but this ain’t cooking Chief. The amount of cayenne you put on there was insulting. You white as hell if you think that’s spicy. This ain’t cooking Chief.
2035 2018-12-10 20:44:42 Yes, akwai iyayi kuma ,she no no say I be Lagos boy
2036 2018-12-10 20:44:38 Oh an apology about an oil spill?  Well that makes it all better.  Cough up some money to help with the cleanup you Neanderthals.
2037 2018-12-10 20:44:35 Nah fam I said HUB style.... Ming ling needa come oil these cheeks and work out the cramps.
2038 2018-12-10 20:44:30 Standard western tropes about the oil and gas industry and how hard done by Albertans are, paying for the rest of Canada and all that. Am I mistaken?
2039 2018-12-10 20:44:19 And no electricity is used refining oil into gasoline, and then transporting that gasoline across the country?

Electric cars still have a smaller carbon footprint, even if they get their energy from coal plants, they ironically consume less electricity.
2040 2018-12-10 20:44:11 They fired the GM. There is a new board. There is a forensic Audit on the missing oil and MOCA and Integrity Commisssion are investigating.  I think those are correct moves. I can’t judge the PM until I see what those investigations bring, his response
2041 2018-12-10 20:43:57 lol --- if you say so --- you seem to have a vast understanding of economics - Petrodollar ending has NOTHING to do with the price of gas - it has to do with the devaluation of the dollar - BTW the Tesla is made from oil lol  - not very bright are you - hope you have looks
2042 2018-12-10 20:43:52 Oh #weakandy @JustinTrudeau doesn't import oil from Saudi Arabia neither does Canada. Private Companies do and like and  they are concerned with maximizing profits.  It is a system called capitalism, it has a lot of flaws but to date we haven't come up with anything better
2043 2018-12-10 20:43:50 My son, a chef, told me it’s because palm oil cheaper and easier to mix with other ingredients than other oils and fats.
2044 2018-12-10 20:43:50 I've been using olive oil for about a week and a half as per my doctor's orders.
2045 2018-12-10 20:43:47 If you want to see where we would be placed economically you just have to. Look at similarly sized Indy Countries and then remember Scotland is wealthier than most of them...even without Oil.
2046 2018-12-10 20:43:35 Aw bless  let's have a look at some of the things that You lot will have to come on bended knee to negotiate

*TRIDENT - it's outta here, base it in South Coast
*OIL - 96% of production is ours, so your fucked
*WHISKEY AND FRESH PRODUCE - 5BILLION OIT OF YOUR COFFERS
2047 2018-12-10 20:43:28 You are wrong. The oil sands have received a lot of government help. Also, Alberta charged absurdly low royalties for years, which is part of the reason why Alberta found itself in so much trouble when oil prices collapsed.
2048 2018-12-10 20:43:05 siri, what’s the largest amount of lavender oil i can legally purchase?
2049 2018-12-10 20:42:56 Meanwhile in Texas, Rystad Energy estimates over 400 million cubic feet/day natural gas flared in order to produce around 2 million bbl/d oil from the Permian. Alberta’s equivalent for the same volume of oil, 37 MMcfd (AER data). What does that social license buy? US work visa?
2050 2018-12-10 20:42:54 Gah! Having an intelligent conversation with a Scientologist is like trying to solve a rubix cube covered in baby oil while wearing boxing gloves.
2051 2018-12-10 20:42:45 Really appreciate the work of the campaign for #sustainable palm oil and their work with M&S, the Coop and Waitrose. So far I have not seen a label for sustainable palm oil on any Mince Pies. It is either palm oil or no palm oil. How can I make an informed choice as a consumer?
2052 2018-12-10 20:42:41 It’s the users of oil and gas that is burning the planet the oil and gas industry is just supplying the demand
2053 2018-12-10 20:42:41 As a Retail Trader.
I've always studied the Central Banks.
I can see how they could try to do that. Saudis flood the market driving oil prices down. So they have to get their money for stocks.
Makes sense. Even the Cabal has to eat.
Yeap, I see a reset and fed
Audit coming 
2054 2018-12-10 20:42:28 Bruv goferment fit say we go pay tax for dat one as dem Ghana dey nau!

Anyway sha, we go deklear say na tithe for water and oil dem! 

No shaku shaku here!
2055 2018-12-10 20:42:27 He is 100% correct, we are seeing the true US global dictatorship rise. From the silencing of Assange, to the illegal occupation of the Syrian oil fields, & fake Russiaphobia... Now with huawei potentially, dealing in Iran, the US see this as a threat to its 5g military network.
2056 2018-12-10 20:42:27 @realDonaldTrump says we are the world’s biggest producer of oil and he can keep oil prices down. Don’t worry, we will be fine without Mohamed Bin Salman & his murderous & oppressive regime.
2057 2018-12-10 20:42:11 You are delusional lol. What leverage do they have now? That keeps them friends with Russia and America? Oil. You are ignorant as they come.
2058 2018-12-10 20:41:50 I laugh at guys who take their car to a shop to get an oil change 
2059 2018-12-10 20:41:49 Now we know where he got his knowledge on the oil business, from reading the The Patch. Did he think we would all think he’s intelligent by saying he read it?! He’s clueless! Many people struggling & losing their jobs across Canada &these are the type of questions & answers 
2060 2018-12-10 20:41:49 So what? Coal usage is going down and renewals are way up.  We should be doing even more.  At the same time, importing less oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela is good in my book.  Whats the non-center left solution?
2061 2018-12-10 20:41:34 Oil space, not energy, you meant to say, right?
2062 2018-12-10 20:41:33 According to Investors Business Daily...the United States is an oil exporting nation for the first time in 70 years.
2063 2018-12-10 20:41:26 Nance may be too busy to see these “kids”... She has Big Oil money to worry about, ‘cause she only has a few hundred million in her bank accounts.
2064 2018-12-10 20:41:25 Most women like to see THEIR man getting the job done. But yeah a lot of it comes down to that too. Can’t expect a man to know everything. Just sad that women these days can change their own tire/oil and men can’t.
2065 2018-12-10 20:41:17 All things "NATURAL"?
Destroying forest = oxygen
Polluting Oceans = no oxygen
Polluting Air = + carbon - oxygen
Adding carbon to air & ground
Transportation & industry = + heat
Dead zones in Gulf = oil
Oil = + carbon, methane, pollution & death
Mass extinction of animals
NATURAL?
2066 2018-12-10 20:41:11 I was wondering what the heck was going on with you rocking the oil drop!?! #gamblingisbad
2067 2018-12-10 20:41:00 The British were supporting Saud as far back as 1915 and oil discovered in 1938 so get your facts straight.
2068 2018-12-10 20:40:52 "There are many provinces here left stranded by Alberta's oil or Ontario's industry" says @BlaineHiggs #TGF @AmericasForum #cdnpoli
2069 2018-12-10 20:40:46 Instead of getting a oil change, brakes, tires, and who else fucking knows. I’m just gonna get a new car.
2070 2018-12-10 20:40:41 I disagree. For me team of the year means a team. Not a whole organization (though even the whole C9 organizations accomplishments don't add up to more than what Astralis accomplished). BTW not trying to hate on C9. Always been a fan of them <3
2071 2018-12-10 20:40:40 Truth - lol Obama turned 2 illegal Bush wars into 7 - worlds largest economy is war - followed by drugs then oil then food/booze - I am simply saying careful what you wish for - Petrodollar collapse will end the USA economy as we know it.
2072 2018-12-10 20:40:37 Alternative can be 5 kg tin cans.

Which can increase the product cost by 5₹ per kg minimum 

Currently 15 kg tin costs > 60₹

Constraints using 5 kg tin
-> Chance of breakage is more when shipped bulk from oil mills 
-> Cost price is more than plastic package
2073 2018-12-10 20:40:26 All I want for Christmas is a lifetime supply of black castor oil.

Thank you.
2074 2018-12-10 20:40:22 FINALLY, America Ends Dependence On Foreign Oil, Addresses Climate Change Better Than the #EU
2075 2018-12-10 20:40:18 Hanty I saw some scoopers collecting groundnut oil in some gutterferious environment this morning, please can you ask a fan* to take 200k - 500k to that place and buy back the substance at 3X the market price/Litre, least some new disease outbreak thence, mbok! 
2076 2018-12-10 20:40:12 Oil is going away.

2079 2018-12-10 20:39:41 I’m glad not everybody thinks I’m totally crazy (only partially). Those are amazing tweets. I think one cruise missile aimed at one major oil pipeline or port would shake up the political climate, but I have no idea how it would play out over time.
2080 2018-12-10 20:39:41 Canada is not buying any oil from Saudi`s also Saudi prince who is supported by Trump a lot. When you are criticizing Canadian gov. you should learn those facts first. Also, ppl in Saudi Arabia are richer than you are and have fewer crime rates FYI
2081 2018-12-10 20:39:38 Full houses in Edmonton and Calgary for teddy bear toss games have left Oil Kings leading league in attendance at 6,791 and Hitmen right there at 6,683. Spokane (5,479), Regina (5,093) and Portland (5,084) follow.
2082 2018-12-10 20:39:30 these niggas are always tryna finesse me, like damn I just came in for an oil change tf
2083 2018-12-10 20:39:24 You're going to be unhappy when you see how big oil industry was Hillary Clinton's biggest campaign bundler in 2016 and where Beto is getting his money. Perhaps it's your corrupt party pandering to big money, not Bernie (much as I don't care for Bernie either)?
2084 2018-12-10 20:39:22 As someone who lives in the mountains of VA, I can agree. Our house is heated via fuel oil boilers (2 of them) and everything else is propane. Starts to get expensive as there are no pipes, but tanks put back that have to be refueled by large tanker trucks. Love rural living 
2085 2018-12-10 20:39:07 What about people in Abuja and Kano
2086 2018-12-10 20:39:05 I remember trying rosehip oil in the past, I can’t remember why I stopped though. I’m just sick of wasting money trying out products. 
I know tons about skincare, my skin is just really sensitive  Thank you!

The way you're going down, you fit find oil.
2096 2018-12-10 20:38:17 "At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 virgins who took lamps & went out to meet the bridegroom. 5 of them were foolish & 5 were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil w/them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along w/their lamps."
2097 2018-12-10 20:38:15 Like essential oil diffusers?
2098 2018-12-10 20:38:07 Aww,been there done that .i am here selecting what I want to eat with minimal oil in a kitchen that smells yum. P.s I don’t have to shout to buy water sis

2100 2018-12-10 20:37:56 Google News bureau will go directly to Vermont biotech to London looming in Madrid. Why does that I picked up with oil prices?
2101 2018-12-10 20:37:48 Because they have oil.....you utterly obtuse human
2102 2018-12-10 20:37:47 Its just amazing to see valuations here -  scary that they are valued like oil will not be needed in 5 years- maybe I watch too many Mad Max movies
2103 2018-12-10 20:37:46 Paramedic yes, oil field no  but I'd never turn down my own action figure!
2104 2018-12-10 20:37:44 First - he has no choice but to ‘take the dough’.

Second, no one elected him to champion new oil pipelines.
2105 2018-12-10 20:37:34 I'm going to put a coconut oil on my ends too
2106 2018-12-10 20:37:33 Oil energy jmb l sa7a
2107 2018-12-10 20:37:33 Putin is strategically arming Serbia and adding oil on fire in Kosovo . He wants Balkans and Ukraine in war, and Middle East in unrest . Trump is his distraction.
2108 2018-12-10 20:37:21 You mustn't be Canadian but a MAGA/MCGA bot. The Canadian government does not buy oil. A grade 4 student would know that. Cheers.
2109 2018-12-10 20:37:19 Because I can`t find 800 billion barrels of oil? Harsh.
2110 2018-12-10 20:37:18 No. It’s ridiculous to believe that a modern industrial society wouldn’t have an appetite for oil.
2111 2018-12-10 20:37:17 How is paying $4.5 billion of taxpayer dollars for a disintegrating #tarsands pipeline (& ongoing sick levels of subsidies to oil & gas co.) "doing it"? you could fund WAY more #renewables & get worker #transition programs going...

2113 2018-12-10 20:37:09 Go on then! 

I’ll sample your oil!
2114 2018-12-10 20:37:09 That's just one case of confusion, look at the benefits to the economy  in such a time we we take loans to pay other loans, medicinal properties of the oil extracts,fibre from the stem and many more. It will be regularised for public usage by limiting the age at 21 years.
2115 2018-12-10 20:37:03 Took my fish oil AND some CBD right now... if my brain doesn’t expand enough for this final then it wasn’t meant to be
2116 2018-12-10 20:37:01 Thinking about getting a vintage oil can to keep lube in cause aesthetic honestly
2117 2018-12-10 20:36:52 I'm sceptical of oil salesmen. They're snakes.
2118 2018-12-10 20:36:52 Lol... As u said maybe some of them are only after the forbidden fruit
2119 2018-12-10 20:36:50 Hi there!  Bio-Oil supplements the skin’s natural oil layer, helping to restore its barrier function of retaining moisture. For best results apply twice daily 
2120 2018-12-10 20:36:45 That’s fine to say but governments both right and left DO bail out the oil industry so saying that you want the market to decide is a bit disingenuous.
2121 2018-12-10 20:36:42 But if Alberta could survive on its own, secede from Canada. Negotiate trade agreements to get that oil through a sovereign nation. Maybe you'll have better luck. You still can't tell me how it's Trudeau's fault. It just is. Doesn't solve any problems but you feel better right?
2122 2018-12-10 20:36:41 + of chaos hiding just offshore. 

They've definitely noticed, shoulders tensing and eyes darting over to meet his. It's not enough to really Bother them, they're just frustrated they can't Ask. 

"What do you use to fry things then? Oil's kinda Gross, and it gets everywhere." +
2123 2018-12-10 20:36:40 Why?
2124 2018-12-10 20:36:37 I even have a oil for that, with lavender (relaxing) and Camphor (blood circulation, making your back warm) and I forgot the name of the third but it's soothing  I really love it, even my really sensitive skin likes it. I love rubbing it in and then go to sleep. 
2125 2018-12-10 20:36:35 Dis nuh make sense but ohk 
2126 2018-12-10 20:36:33 How can u trust someone who supported Utd then their city rivals arrive with oil money and now your a city ultra..what a helmet you are!!
2127 2018-12-10 20:36:30 It'll be interesting to see how they start encroaching on their habitats the pollutants alone will erode their environment.... And with all the deregulation trump's put in place it won't even be a year before there's an Exxon oil type  event.
2128 2018-12-10 20:36:22 It is important. For Rocket League. I love RL (was co owner of Vanquish when the untethered RL team played for us LONG ago xD) but that scene just doesn't have anywhere near the importance that other scenes have in esports yet.
2129 2018-12-10 20:36:06 Oil don't have a starter or backup right now
2130 2018-12-10 20:35:57 ....lolzzz kowa ma bawan Allah ne
2131 2018-12-10 20:35:45 It’s the Oilers game day people that are the problem. Not the venue. Go to an Oil Kings game. They get the crowd into it way better than the Oilers do.
2132 2018-12-10 20:35:44 I do not believe that anyone wants to be the first. There are main tactical political and economic reasons for this. What if the others know more? Whose economy could suffer the most? I think in the US it is the fear of legal consequences and in Rus. the dependence on oil and gas
2133 2018-12-10 20:35:43 Wait, do you think the prime minister buys oil?
2134 2018-12-10 20:35:41 Yea I know but guys do it the most
2135 2018-12-10 20:35:37 I'm gonna give the executives at Exxon 200 delegates. When they vote for the guy good for oil companies, don't be mad at me.
2136 2018-12-10 20:35:32 Why would being a Gold Star father make you brave? Serious quesiton.
2137 2018-12-10 20:35:06 No oil, so healthier, yeah?
2138 2018-12-10 20:35:06 It's part of the problem, no doubt. Saying it is the only problem would mean that you could cut it out, and the problem would be fixed. Deregulation would lead us back to the monopoly days of Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel. There is nuance here.
2139 2018-12-10 20:35:04 ...Adam Ant, Midnight Oil, Psychedelic Furs, Tom Tom Club...um, gonna play @NumanOfficial at some point again @1stWave?

2142 2018-12-10 20:34:54 @realDonaldTrump I just recommend the Tramp government for the last time not to carry out the sanctions imperfectly, because it does not give any results. All sanctions, including oil sanctions, must be fully implemented to make their impact
2143 2018-12-10 20:34:50 Vijay another thing is people who are new to the edible oil field uses the transparent bottles . Which when placed in sunlight could change the characteristics of edible oil from good to bad. 

Hence reason why parachute bottle is blue as it could be in shelf more than 6 months.

2150 2018-12-10 20:34:10 Try it, it’s great.  Sea salt, olive oil, goat cheese and onions. Simple and tasty!
2151 2018-12-10 20:34:09 Quite the contrary. We're on the hook to the tune of $260 billion to clean up the mess. I doubt, once all the number come in, that the oil and gas industry turns out to be a net benefit to Canada.

2155 2018-12-10 20:33:54 I am staying long the full position but I must admit that I am very worried about this thing having no bottom...Today it was pure good news for oil and this melted 1) China demand nos. 2) The Libyan outage (which I think is very serious).
2156 2018-12-10 20:33:52 The continued siege of the coalition forces led to a crisis in oil derivatives, which negatively impacted the performance of media institutions and prevented many of them from continuing #اليوم_العالمي_لحقوق_الإنسان
2157 2018-12-10 20:33:47 I personally mix an oil with a moisturizer. But if you just want a moisturizer the @BobbiBrown one is so so so so so good. Some times I’ll still mix it with an oil if I feel my skin needs more as I have extremely dry skin.
2158 2018-12-10 20:33:46 Thats a no from me. But have you tried magnesium oil
2159 2018-12-10 20:33:39 We ordered a shaving stick (hubby bit old fashioned with his shaving techniques) but does love to be clean shaven. Substituted with beard oil

2165 2018-12-10 20:33:21 What alternative is there that could affordably replace oil and gas? I'll wait.
2166 2018-12-10 20:33:18 Partially fact. I think it is somewhere around 10-15% from Saudi Arabia. It also comes from the US, from Nigeria, and other diverse oil producing countries. Most of it feeds despotic governments that oppress and murder people. That doesn't seem to bother Quebec though.
2167 2018-12-10 20:33:13 Sorry you had to be born in this stupid country where ignorant hungry illiterates are armed with guns and given authority to harass citizens because they are too lazy to do proper investigation. BUT NO... pple rather focus on cooking oil that fell into the gutter ... SHAME

2169 2018-12-10 20:33:07 Donny is simply a snake oil salesman.
All he knows is how to BS, and cook the books.
He never stopped running.

Rallies, Golf, and Fox n Friends are his lifestyle.

2176 2018-12-10 20:32:27 I don't know what CBD oil is, tbh. And my problem with anxiety is once I realize that's why my pulse picked up and my body is buzzing, it is ALL I can focus on and then it just progresses in a bad way.  SO even meditating, I'll just be focusing on freaking out. =(

2190 2018-12-10 20:31:15 The difference between Quebec and Alberta is we have always paid our way and we never have had our hands out for corporate welfare. 80 million a day loss of oil revenues at the present moment and Bombardier get government cheque’s.

2193 2018-12-10 20:31:05 Interesting read but I'm not sure what to make of it. Essentially he says that even though Calgary's economy is diversified it is structurally set up to behave like it isn't.  The oil companies have the province by the balls either way

2195 2018-12-10 20:30:55 Depends on "reasonable" but he is a nice mid-career asset with considerable versaility. I'd suggest more likely than not that he re-ups with the Oil at some point before Jun 30.
2196 2018-12-10 20:30:55 Hi. You talk regularly about energy providers. There is no gas where I live so we are restricted to oil fired heating etc. It’s very expensive. Any suggestions around best deals? #MartinLewis
2197 2018-12-10 20:30:38 @ArcadiaBrands do you guys recommend a specific battery for your oil cartridges? I bought some stardog from @ThePeakOK a while back and the pen that came with it keeps burning cartridges after I recharge it. 
2198 2018-12-10 20:30:35 I need to get my oil changed, and my drivers license & tags. but my motivation not there
2199 2018-12-10 20:30:35 Standing in long queues for kerosene edible oil or sugar turned us self centered, apathetic towards others at subliminal level we detached will humanity.
2200 2018-12-10 20:30:35 China wants free oil and is imposing their domination in South America rich oil, by draining oil we're ever been found. Ecuador a region next to the Orinoco river is an habitats of the indigenous peoples, they're drilling for oil polluting their waters and contaminating the soil

2210 2018-12-10 20:30:09 James Comey as my mechanic: Check the oil? "Don't remember." Check the brakes? "Can't recall". How about tires? "I don't know" Farts... "Oh it does have gas."
2211 2018-12-10 20:30:04 What coincidence, these are the same countries that the greens are supporting by doing everything they can to landlock CDN oil.
2212 2018-12-10 20:29:58 I pay more to get my oil changed at the subaru dealership, but an employee just made me a hot chocolate and it’s that level of adorable that makes it worth it
2213 2018-12-10 20:29:50 In what business? Any ideas? I’ll say it again - The revenue per capita of the oil business in Alberta is very difficult, if not impossible, to create in another business.

2219 2018-12-10 20:29:23 I use it as it’s one of the most superior oils for extraction, easy to make doses for cooking in moulds, the taste is minimal, most people enjoy it. I have not tried grapeseed oil. I have tried seaseme oil, olive, avocado, & cold pressed hemp oil. Next favourite is hemp oil.

2222 2018-12-10 20:29:02 Katelyn i have really oily skin and actually putting oil on ur face before bed stops ur natural oils producing so much! So maybe try bio oil, it might help the scarring and oily skin! 
2223 2018-12-10 20:28:53 Just goes to show you how disconnected oil prices are from the physical market.
2224 2018-12-10 20:28:50 I'm not sure about anything on Oil anymore.  Like we aren't going to use it again.  

Too hard basket.
2225 2018-12-10 20:28:44 Russia pretty much owns Venezuela's oil any way.
2226 2018-12-10 20:28:44 Build the pipe lines and a couple more refineries. Get our oil to market. Put Albertans back to work so we can continue to support the rest of Canada.
2227 2018-12-10 20:28:33 The ham-fisted innuendo aside it's great for lock mechanisms; it doesn't get full of fluff and dust like oil & silicone lubes and is non-ferrous so doesn't accumulate in magnetic components in electromagnetic locks.
2228 2018-12-10 20:28:26 Look at how Tobbaco industry has flourished without US interference, EU-ZW agri-trade is growing uninterupted with many unfufilled quotas. If the US had interests in ZW land reform, they would sabbotage it more directly a d EU wudnt dare touch ZW produce (see Iran Oil and Gas)
2229 2018-12-10 20:28:24  the scrub is just olive oil & brown sugar,  i made it myself
2230 2018-12-10 20:28:15 Luscious body scrub! they actually exfoliate and leaves a nice oil behind for hydration and it makes you feel so fucking smooth
2231 2018-12-10 20:28:05 I see. That makes me feel *somewhat* better. Another question: does your oil contain Lignans, which are to be found naturally in the husk of the Flaxseed? I’ve read that many commercial oils do not contain these, or have them added back in during processing. How about yours?
2232 2018-12-10 20:28:04 No es cierto. Los primeros monopolios que surgen en los Estados Unidos lo hacen en un estado casi sin regulaciones (standard oil, carneggie). Es por eso precisamente que surge la legislación anti monopolio. En colombia la corrupción privada crea monopolios. Véase procesos SIC.
2233 2018-12-10 20:28:03 Because of the nature of the crime.. he put two little girls in oil tankers then went on camera pretending they were missing! He’s a true psychopath pretending to live a happy normal life.. pretty intriguing if you ask me
2234 2018-12-10 20:28:01 Makes you wonder why would anyone hate the igbos?You have had federal power,we don't have,you have all the oil industry we dont..so what is It? I will tell you,it's envy,they envy us because we are undeniably good at what we do. Our people are the least poor in the country
2235 2018-12-10 20:27:57 Because there is a growing western separatist movement, a debt crisis, a hugely controversial UN migration compact, and an oil sector sabotage to talk about right now.

2239 2018-12-10 20:27:41 You would be greatly appreciated sir. Until then, here I sit at the dealership to get my oil changed.
2240 2018-12-10 20:27:40 What do you mean 
2241 2018-12-10 20:27:23 Vote all GOP out to let US get back on track saving the planet. We also need to catch up on new jobs in alternative energy and new products. Coal is dead. Oil will decline. But jobs will be created by investing and inventing new solutions. Kind of an economic no brainer.
2242 2018-12-10 20:27:23 The local leadership of the County Democratic Central Committee, which controls endorsements and resources, do not oppose fracking.  They are oil industry people.
2243 2018-12-10 20:27:22 Your query has been directed to Irving Oil refining Company of Fredericton NB..thank you for your enquiry
2244 2018-12-10 20:27:11 I think US is the root of oil related problems.

2248 2018-12-10 20:26:56 well they pretty much own their oil.
2249 2018-12-10 20:26:41 .....we killin this earth with oil usage.. Main use comes from cars. Too many people buyin cars which means more gas.. Shits scary to think about.
2250 2018-12-10 20:26:37 I'd recommend using an oil on damp skin, then top it with a moisturizer. My favorite facial oils are argan, jojoba, and sweet almond. Nourish organics make good facial moisturizers for toppers, I use the rose clay one. Hope that helps <3 La Mer ingredients are shit <3
2251 2018-12-10 20:26:36 Literally just coffee grounds, brown sugar and Coconut oil is my absolute favorite scrub!!
2252 2018-12-10 20:26:31 Haven’t you noticed Muslim Nation attacking Israel life in poverty even with all the wealth the oil produce.

Saudis and Iran are about to have at it.

2258 2018-12-10 20:26:20 Haaretzs, Bertelsman, IBM, Standard Oil, Ford, Bush, etc, etc all made huge profits of slave labor during WW II, they "missed" Neurenberg and still make huges profits and "rule" their part of the world.
When will judgement day come? 
2259 2018-12-10 20:26:18 It's still better than cooking with motor oil
2260 2018-12-10 20:26:05 Yes, it's a small thing to take down a sitting president for treason. The same one who literally is trying to burn the world for oil profits. Is promoting military growth over budget or infrastructure. Yeah, it's a waste of time.

2263 2018-12-10 20:25:59 so what do you do to help save the environment, you sound like you burn as much oil and gas as you can and strew your plastics through the ocean so you can kill whales, I make money off the carbon tax by lowering my carbon footprint and collecting a rebate cheque
2264 2018-12-10 20:25:51 I add a sprinkle of some random essential oil.
2265 2018-12-10 20:25:51 Peppermint oil and come cuddle
2266 2018-12-10 20:25:48 Yes. Edibles, tinctures, pastries, soda, strips...it depends where you live and what the laws are. There are also oil concentrates that are edible.
2267 2018-12-10 20:25:40 Canada has all the oil it will ever need !!!!!!! Come on Quebec think of the rest us too. We are all Canadians first ! 
Vive la Canadienne
2268 2018-12-10 20:25:32 He said again today in Parliament that Quebec will not allow Alberta oil to cross Quebec by any means whatsoever! He doesn’t mind taking the money from Alberta though does he?

2270 2018-12-10 20:25:30 Trump has too many oil interests throwing $$$ into his pocket. He'll never be able to face the reality of what the planet faces. Even if he took an interest, he's too stupid to grok the concept.

2274 2018-12-10 20:25:03 The Govt of Canada does not own any refineries, Alberta made sure of that long ago. So why would it import crude oil, which has no other purpose besides being refined?

Maybe it is you who should talk to your doctor about getting an MRI.
2275 2018-12-10 20:24:39 Astralis held form all year and so far have 9 very notable tournament wins (including a major). If they win Blast Pro it'll be 10 wins.

2279 2018-12-10 20:24:28 Easy. This is the REAL TRUTH from the mouth of a Canadian minister verbatim on the CBC. 41/2 million barrels a day to US oil companies at $7 a barrel. Need more info?
2280 2018-12-10 20:24:28 Ok then olive oil sample?
2281 2018-12-10 20:24:28 [THREAD]

OPEC + Russia deal last week to cut oil production by 1.2 million bpd was a major geopolitical event & reinforces sheer inanity of Trump admin's strategically self-defeating #Iran policy.

Also reveals hints of Trump & co's personal conflicts of interest w/ MBS regime.

2286 2018-12-10 20:23:58 I just use coconut oil, white sugar (or salt, whatever you have more of) and some regular ground coffee. You can add whatever essential oils you want for scent- I put in ground cinnamon sometimes. Just mix it and scrub!
2287 2018-12-10 20:23:56 While May is working with those same nations to help keep our oil landlocked.
2288 2018-12-10 20:23:34 Why oil is going sky high soon. The market is about to realize it needs a huge amount of oil and it's 5 years away. Oops.

2295 2018-12-10 20:22:45 you're as rude as you are ignorant. you give Albertans and Canadians a bad name by proclaiming yourself to be one of us while discounting the importance of our environment and our environment's future in favour of oil money
2296 2018-12-10 20:22:41 Stephen Barclay has run away.  Snake oil salesman.
2297 2018-12-10 20:22:41 My Kenya friend told me that we have more inventions that the white that Benin kingdom used oil palm to light their street. Then I asked if it was oil palm she was using to power her phone.
Listen to what she said
2298 2018-12-10 20:22:37 See C9 is exactly the team i was thinking about when I wrote my initial tweet. A LOT of C9 fan boys were booty hurt. A couple of their teams did decent with only one team winning an actual important event (the CS major) and now look how that roster is doing.
2299 2018-12-10 20:22:33 Paul 7, Paul NNPC, Use your oil money to buy tickets for us
2300 2018-12-10 20:22:30 CBD oil is amazing for anxiety. Extracted straight from the plant so you get the same benefits but don’t get high. The only problem is that it’s exy and illegal here. But we managed to get a bottle from a trusted source
2301 2018-12-10 20:22:29 This is one of the most innocent girl I know in my life, she's a wife material.
2302 2018-12-10 20:22:14 I must be stupid. Don't worry. Suadi oil has only been bought by liberals and pipelines haven't been blocked by provinces ever before. It's all libs fault carry on.
2303 2018-12-10 20:22:10 ....hahahaha mai wayo kawai
2304 2018-12-10 20:22:06 I'm curious: Do you use coconut oil for the taste? Have you ever tried grapeseed oil?
2305 2018-12-10 20:21:56 The continued siege of the coalition forces led to a crisis in oil derivatives, which negatively impacted the performance of media institutions and prevented many of them from continuing #اليوم_العالمي_لحقوق_الإنسان
2306 2018-12-10 20:21:54 I’m betting zero with exception of the Sanctions that Congress oversees...

But oil was their game. And now they’re teaming up with China.
2307 2018-12-10 20:21:37 Whoosh this baby loves scotts emulsion cod liver oil. ..like analilia kijiko more than 2.
2308 2018-12-10 20:21:35 brandons getting his MSHA to work in the oil fields next year. we’re going to be moving to Nevada, he’s going to be making about $90 an hour so we’re going to save up & by 2020 we will be moving to the south far away from AZ. we have plans & we’re going to achieve them together
2309 2018-12-10 20:21:32 Honestly, break Holo enough and he's a mess. He'd be spilling blood, oil, fuel, coolant... His belly plates would all be broken and black, since they're glass screens. Wires sticking out, motors and servos struggling and sparking.
2310 2018-12-10 20:21:15 Get the olbas oil on the go that works wonders  #GetWellSoon
2311 2018-12-10 20:21:14 Nah dude 

Oil is awesome
2312 2018-12-10 20:21:12 I need to order more Vitamin E oil ASAP my face does not like that i haven’t used it in 4 days 
2313 2018-12-10 20:21:10 oil can't keep the bid. still 50 / 49.5 should hold.
2314 2018-12-10 20:21:07 was gonna post my thing about omega fatty acids then realized i made about 4 typos in it so nvm..... just take fish oil supplements....
2315 2018-12-10 20:21:02 Tempting, but I think this whole shit-show is going to be incredibly important for future Big Data lawmakers. Like with our oil boom, the UK is an object lesson to the world in what NOT to do.

Horrible for us but important for everybody else. Like killing Megatron in the past.
2316 2018-12-10 20:21:01 How about the  roads in oil country that needs fixed. That is right eastern Montana is just a fly over for you
2317 2018-12-10 20:21:00 Have you tried olbas oil in hot water towel over your head and inhale.
2318 2018-12-10 20:20:59 Sauté it in Olive oil, garlic, salt & pepper, and sprinkle parm cheese on top when it’s done. Swear you’ll love it
2319 2018-12-10 20:20:47 My latest painting 'Praiano Vista'. 11.5x12" oil on board
2320 2018-12-10 20:20:44 Лол, мне далеко до твоего уровня. Хотя... Думаю тебе тяжело было свыкнуться, ведь в первой серии показывают только Нацу, Люси и Водолея. Да, там ещё был и "Саламандер", но я его чёт не встречала ни в одном фф.
2321 2018-12-10 20:20:43 Coconut oil! Once or twice a week coat your hair in it, put a shower cap on (so it doesn’t ruin your bedding), leave in on over night and wash in the morning. I swear by it. I bleached my hair over and over again when I was younger. Coconut oil saved me 
2322 2018-12-10 20:20:39 Depends on what kind of cooking oil, some cooking oil is bad for you.
2323 2018-12-10 20:20:38 In England it rains oil instead of water? If not then it's the same.
2324 2018-12-10 20:20:34 The @purlisse coconut oil + coffee sugar scrub 
2325 2018-12-10 20:20:33 Update: your advice was invaluable and my new ACT clutch balls harder than LeBron and also I changed my own oil for the first time and discovered the best oil to use for my particular car from the forums. Thanks again, Mr. The Roman!
2326 2018-12-10 20:20:31 Wow energy names couldn't bounce for even a minute despite a 500 point rebound in the Dow. Hard to try to bottom pick $OIH $XLE names when price action is this awful. Have to think $OIL has another leg lower w/ this kind of price action in the energy names too
2327 2018-12-10 20:20:23 @art_of_chart end of day thoughts on oil and natgas?
2328 2018-12-10 20:20:20 الاحصاءات تقول ان برميل النفط يتم تداوله في السوق قرابة ١٢ مرة قبل ان يتم استخدامة.
#طاقة #معلومة #سوق_النفط 
عجيب!

Statistically speaking each barrel of oil is traded 12 times before it is finally consumed.

Interesting !
2329 2018-12-10 20:20:07 Gee, I just have to ponder (@realDonaldTrump ) how a CEO of Exxon Oil could possibly be dumb as a rock and lazy as hell. Doubt you've ever had to answer to anybody.  BTW You only hire the BEST people!  recuerdo??
2330 2018-12-10 20:20:04 Considering the pressures that oil & gas is facing, it makes sense.  The program is very costly.  So like everything else, they just pass the costs on to the end user.
2331 2018-12-10 20:19:58 Canada is just fine. Let them pull out of our real estate. Let them refuse our oil and natural resources. The thing is, the US isn't as independent as it wants to be. They still need our cheap oil. They still need our lumber.
2332 2018-12-10 20:19:58 ... and that artificial increase in the GDP? 
"After his election as president in 1998, Hugo Chávez... nationalized foreign oil fields." - Washington Post, 27 July 2018.
2333 2018-12-10 20:19:56 Oil're nuts bon appetit
2334 2018-12-10 20:19:53 Yeah.. I’ll probably just go straight home after work each day to sleep.. then ask Ka Frank for an anointing of oil .
2335 2018-12-10 20:19:49 In what way are they cheaper? My utility Bills keep increasing. I pay more in taxes each year than solar and wind techs gross. Yet I cant afford solar or wind.
The gov wants my taxes and to trade oil while energy companies want billions while workers make a fraction.

2338 2018-12-10 20:19:21 Tough to yield distillates and fuel oils using just +55 API oil, heavy crude is in significant demand in the GOM. WCS is currently trading at a 28% discount to WTI. Maya trades at a premium to WTI right now
2339 2018-12-10 20:19:19 I'm sure oil money can't buy the future though
2340 2018-12-10 20:19:11 OPEC Cuts = oil down - Libya closure = oil down - Eia, api draws = oil down. At this rate oil is gonna be free when I wake up   #OOTT
2341 2018-12-10 20:19:04 So the #CPC is proposing to nationalize private oil companies bringing in foreign oil?
2342 2018-12-10 20:19:04 Witchbaby Soap has some of the most amazing scrubs that are super hydrating as well since they have a coconut oil base, typically!
2343 2018-12-10 20:19:03 Ohio weather be making my skin soooo dry in the winter. I just wanna dive into some Coconut Oil 
2344 2018-12-10 20:19:01 Dear Captain luck,

2346 2018-12-10 20:18:49 The house of Saud sees its citizens as the true Muslims hence its reluctance to do anything in the Middle East apart from sell oil
2347 2018-12-10 20:18:48 I've been using an oil base nail recover polish which is great until my phone gets covered in grease
2348 2018-12-10 20:18:42 Is this true for oil crops in general?
2349 2018-12-10 20:18:40 I'm old & remember my mum baking bread & cakes in the old days. The only palm oil product we had in the house was a bar of soap. Why is palm oil in every @Warburtons product? I don't eat soap & it clearly isn't needed. It doesn't appear it Bake Off. It isn't needed
2350 2018-12-10 20:18:37 Get that free oil change sis
2351 2018-12-10 20:18:30 Questions not asked: 1) With only 3 years of teaching experience you are not qualified to run a school, why would you say you are? 2) I don’t believe you just finished reading The Patch, can you tell us a brief history of the oil sands?
2352 2018-12-10 20:18:29 No, the article did not contain one single quote from a #denialist.  Those who mention #petroltax - which is BS with oil price so low - say its only one of a series of taxes.
2353 2018-12-10 20:18:26 I made myself chilaquiles to take to work for lunch, and goddamn I forget how much anything fried in corn oil is a comfort food for Mexicans. 
2354 2018-12-10 20:18:23 Saudi’s have power because they have the most oil on the planet. They could sell that to more than just the west. And no he is not representative of all Muslims he is representative of those who follow him. He is an imam.
2355 2018-12-10 20:18:21 I.e more subsidies for renewables, and less subsidies for oil and gas.
2356 2018-12-10 20:18:19 Ontario, where I lived just bailed on cap n'trade w/ Quebec & California, Quebec is still in
Alberta (our oil powerhouse), & British Columbia have Carbon Taxes
Federally Canada will go w/ a tax & dividend plan 
I see no advantage, politically of one system over the others
2357 2018-12-10 20:18:19 Lol, my family is actually pretty big into essential oils. But for some reason peppermint only makes my headaches worse. Idk if it's cause my skin can't handle how hot the oil is or what. But :// thanks tho love, I've got ibuprofen so hopefully it'll stop soon
2358 2018-12-10 20:18:16 "Also if manufacturing does increase it will increase the dollar."
Not nearly to the same degree that oil exports increase it.
2359 2018-12-10 20:18:14 @BismarkTheJoke "the oil is not hot, that's why you didn't hear the SOUNDTRACK psssshh"...     Things you say though lol
#Apartment22
2360 2018-12-10 20:18:13 Ha ha ha..... And all those other areas depend on products that are made from petrochemicals. Just selling "oil" is not all of it. You can't sell a house without using oil, oil is in our hospitals and Healthcare, it's in every facet of our lives. Can't you understand that?
2361 2018-12-10 20:18:06 I love a good body oil! 
2362 2018-12-10 20:18:01 Somewhere in the past 10 years or so, when the price of oil was at $100 a barrel. Alberta was riding high and had no deficit.  Like other provinces.  All of them.  Then the price of oil fell.  What was the fall back plan?
2363 2018-12-10 20:18:01 You Want your skin to look oily?  Foreign to me since I’ve fought greasy skin all my life. Of course, now I’m 50 and don’t mind as much. Strictly use Oil of Olay. I sampled the Neutrogena Hydrofuge and it’s awesome. You can get a $5 sample tub at WalMart. I’m cheap. Drugstore.
2364 2018-12-10 20:18:00 You know that until n unless PNP address this corruption scandal involving oil,  they will never be taken seriously on issues of corruption. Who will step up and take responsibility for Trafigura?
2365 2018-12-10 20:17:56 We would have lower, stable oil, gas prices if Americans were allowed to benefit by the abiotic oil wealth of this country. Weary middle-class & poor have been burdened too long by needless high costs & profits sucked up by top dogs. Taxed to poverty, while cream goes to top.

2369 2018-12-10 20:17:39 Why should Canada be buying any oil from Saudi Arabia ?
2370 2018-12-10 20:17:25 You are the most destructive minister ever to hold a portfolio in this country. Your primary objective of destroying the oil and gas industry will not be forgotten on election day and it can't come soon enough for me.
2371 2018-12-10 20:17:23 Ok best case scenario will tag brokers target of £14+ but that’s if oil prices played ball,I never take much notice of targets but this play is way undervalued.These days I generally have a flip out price between 20%- 40% that’s just me after being greedy over the years.
2372 2018-12-10 20:17:09 coconut oil, leave it in for a few hours and then shampoo it out.

2375 2018-12-10 20:16:51 Patents only last 20 years, are public, and are indexed on major search engines. I'm not saying that serious effort by oil companies and vehicle manufacturers hasn't been undertaken to hide the impact of climate change, but patents are NOT how its being done.

2377 2018-12-10 20:16:35 Not doubting it at all....All I'm suggesting is develop an economy that isn't based on oil.
2378 2018-12-10 20:16:31 Anytime Canada's oil and gas industry wants to stop relying on all the government subsidies and incentives, it's OK with me.

2381 2018-12-10 20:16:06 I have tinnitus and I tried CBD oil and tried a lot of other stuff like high dosage of magnesium, rhodiola rosea. It may help a bit but there are some other nutritions and exercises which, in combination, makes it much better. Dm me if you want more informations.
2382 2018-12-10 20:16:00 Don't blame the voters! Blame the charlatans and snake oil salesmen who sold them the lies.......
2383 2018-12-10 20:15:57 I feel the opposite of contempt. I hate seeing hard working people at the mercy of a volatile commodity & a provincial government that mismanaged it from the day the oil was found. You get peanuts for it, as much as Nigeria. You're getting robbed.

2388 2018-12-10 20:15:45 It's really hard I think if I ever bleach it again I'm gonna do a bleach bath which is where you cover your hair in coconut oil first to have kind of a protective layer but since my hair will be virgin hair now it'll probably be enough to lift it that way a couple of times.

2393 2018-12-10 20:15:15 The use of oil isn’t going away anytime soon, despite all the “should’s”. Would b great if we could not burn down places & ppl while we wait for the world to catch up to what it “should” be doing.
2394 2018-12-10 20:15:15 Yasssss these 12 days gonna be   bring it on. I got the black castor oil ready for these edges

2396 2018-12-10 20:15:09 Leftover rice, oil, egg, your favorite seasonings, onion, garlic, any kind of meat in small bite size pieces, spring onion should do the trick :)
2397 2018-12-10 20:15:09 Siding with Saudi Arabia and Russia too big oil producers about global warming is ridiculous
2398 2018-12-10 20:15:03 Yeah, massive oil wealth.
2399 2018-12-10 20:14:55 Drinking my water daily and using coconut oil
2400 2018-12-10 20:14:54 That was probably congress because lets face it, big oil is global and they hold no allegiance. Solar is the only thing that can effectively kill big oil because it has become economically competitive. Obama did huge solar ie: Ivanpah. Stopped some pipelines too
2401 2018-12-10 20:14:45 It's a crime to be poor in Nigeria; hence the proliferation of social ills. Everyone wants get rich quickly and by all means so as to escape the humiliation of poverty.

2416 2018-12-10 20:13:30 Well hopefully these’ll help! After you use the sulfur stuff, wash your hands with a bit of baking soda to get rid of the smell. I’ve also heard citrus oil can help.

2429 2018-12-10 20:12:21 There's that typical Alberta poor me attitude, they are a rich province with the govern giving billions in subsidies to a year and bought a pipeline for and it's not good enough. 
Cry me a river, our province gives all our money to the Irving's so I dont feel bad for big oil.
2430 2018-12-10 20:12:02 Oh please - Alberta has held the biggest grudge against the rest of Canada as long as I’ve been alive.  Oil is killing the planet, and in turn us.  TMX, if it happens, should be the last pipeline.

2440 2018-12-10 20:10:41 Not looking too bullish to me but I'm no expert  Seriously, thoughts on next direction for oil?

2442 2018-12-10 20:10:17 The decision to leave the oil cartel is aimed at reinforcing the country’s autonomy from its Persian Gulf neighbors.

To help Israel to illegally occupy Golan Heights and drill for oil. And let religious fanatics to illegaly settle in occupied West bank.

2462 2018-12-10 20:08:33 94 mi barrels of oil are used per day and that does no include natural gas, coal. We are changing the comp of the atm. co2 and methane are green house gases. The ocean does absorb some co2 resulting in acidification. The comp of the atm varies with height.

2465 2018-12-10 20:08:16 Yes, Elon Musk is an idiot. Electric cars are more damaging to humans who collect the materials AND the environment than oil.
2466 2018-12-10 20:08:14 It’s mostly Canadian oil coming from the US.
2467 2018-12-10 20:08:12 Canaxen are my favourite brand as well. I've used CBD oil for the past few years. I seemed to be a new adopter of this remedy before the hype.

2474 2018-12-10 20:07:34 I learned today that a generator needs oil
2475 2018-12-10 20:07:24 OH! I didn't see it in the trailer but the thing coming out of the ground with the oil derricks looks like Destroyer and sounds like him. That's not Mothra for sure.
2476 2018-12-10 20:07:22 Labor and environmentalist groups consist of hundreds of thousands of workers.  Big bank and oil lobbyists represent the interest of their billionaire board of directors.  These two are not equivocal.
2477 2018-12-10 20:07:16 I liked the quip by Hitch where he said, in so many words, that the Oilers aren't quite running with the big dogs, but those dogs should be nervous in facing the Oil.
2478 2018-12-10 20:07:11 Sulfur wash REEKS but does a great job of controlling oil. I still use the retin at night because it’s fantastic for wrinkles too. That’s a typical regimen, sometimes with Doxy, before Accutane. 4 of my sisters and I were on the exact same thing.

Then they started on Native American lands met with protest paid NA .01% of what they made these 2 enterprises is where they made most of their money
2483 2018-12-10 20:07:05 This is a right wing diversion from the quest to bring the Trump criminal enterprise and corrupt family to justice; to expose the racist GOP as a wholly owned subsidiary of big oil, Russia, and the Koch ilk... here’s their answer: Hillary, Hillary, Obama, Obama, Comey, Comey...

2489 2018-12-10 20:06:47 There is nothing to support. Big oil has raked in billions in profits this year. Why don't Albertans understand that?
2490 2018-12-10 20:06:43 Thank god for cbd oil man, my migraines have went from unbearable to “okay I’ll live”

2494 2018-12-10 20:06:28 I don't have contempt for any province. What I have contempt for is inept management of your resources. And why, if the oil & most of the profits, belong to Alberta, do you want Canada to set up a sovereign wealth fund? I thought you guys knew what you were doing. Hm. Guess not.
2495 2018-12-10 20:06:12 KEEP IT IN THE GROUND !! Keep the oil 'neath the soil, keep the gas under the grass. Keep the need, lose the greed. Keep the land healthy for the sake of your children, and their children, and their children, Keep in mind that we need to do it all NOW.
2496 2018-12-10 20:06:08 Sort of. We work on fluids from drilling rigs, service rigs and oil sands returns. 
We take the solids out so the water isn’t poisoned.

2504 2018-12-10 20:05:04 We need vast machines to purify the air. With the increase in population, the advances of developing nations, along with the increases in production of oil, carbon emission reductions will not be met. Alternative energy resources are still the future, but the problem is the air.

2510 2018-12-10 20:04:43 What may be genuinely different this time is that the world may be swinging away from the traditional 'back to oil' cycle due to climate and energy efficiency policies etc. Not guaranteed (IEA certainly thinks big path for oil still), but if so, we need to rethink EQ in Canada.
2511 2018-12-10 20:04:40 once here in my country, I went to an event about Syria and they were saying that the Kurds took all the Syrian desert from ISIS,. everyone knows that the Kurdish advance in northern Syria was only in the interest of oil and gas. these lectures make me sick..

2514 2018-12-10 20:04:13 How much is a human life worth to Individual 1's administration?  The price of cheap oil.
2515 2018-12-10 20:04:02 President Trump keep up the great work.  Thanks for cutting my taxes & oh I’m not a millionaire.  Thanks for drilling  for more American Oil & keeping gas prices really low.  Please start CUTTING SPENDING.

2521 2018-12-10 20:03:21 In addition we devote a tremendous amount of oil energy and subsidization towards the current work dismantling soil. It would be amazing what will be accomplished with just the redirection a part of that energy
2522 2018-12-10 20:03:12 Typically, Albertans reaped the immediate benefits of a return to higher oil prices or stronger economic growth and was able to continue with the lowest taxes in the country while still building lots of schools, roads, etc. Those were choices made by Albertans actually.

2563 2018-12-10 19:59:44 #MondayThoughts #MondayMotivation #nomoreexcuses Get oil out of politics..
2564 2018-12-10 19:59:40 That Trudeau was responsible for Alberta’s oil price differential.
2565 2018-12-10 19:59:33 This is not poverty at all. This is greed and wickedness. This people will not consume this oil. The oil ll be consumed by innocent Nigerians like you and I. 
This is bad, this total wickedness, this is not poverty.
2566 2018-12-10 19:59:30 LMFAO fuck you Baby Oil
2567 2018-12-10 19:59:27 Put it this way Mr Fast Brain:
..You wouldnt be interested in a degree that teaches you to mine oil in Zim yet when we don’t have oil mines it makes no sense, but if oil is discovered, our universities should introduce oil mining degrees
2568 2018-12-10 19:59:24 As far as I know only Irving in Saint John imports Saudi oil and only since Lac Megantic mostly. I know why they ship less by rail now, but not sure why Saudis replaced Algeria as primary alternative source of foreign oil after the US, much of which is from Alberta. Call Irving.
2569 2018-12-10 19:59:24 How can you possibly fuck up an oil change lol.
2570 2018-12-10 19:59:21 Since #Individual1 is s climate change denier, maybe he should ask a barrel of oil to be his CoS!
2571 2018-12-10 19:59:17 Quebec doesn't import much oil from Saudi at all since the Enbridge line opened. The main importer of Saudi oil is the Irving Refinery in New Brusnwick. Irving's President, a hardcore Conservative, has told the @financialpost  that he will import regardless of pipelines. #cdnpoli
2572 2018-12-10 19:58:47 I got cinnamon oil on my hands making everything smell christmassy and then touched my eyes so if anyone wants to be my new seeing eye dog i'm fucking blinded forever now
2573 2018-12-10 19:58:46 I’m the same man I’m a mechanic so I’m dealing with oil n shit it duck yo hands right up
2574 2018-12-10 19:58:45 Bros, how mekwe go knock engine? Na mekwe make you forget put water inside radiator or put oil inside engine?
2575 2018-12-10 19:58:37 Thank you to the car dealership for squeezing me in today for an oil change, but sitting here waiting for two hours SUCKS
2576 2018-12-10 19:58:34 Aggressive action is required. Capture of carbon by algae ponds makes a very environmentally friendly solution. Captures all carbon and other exhaust gases, feeds algae that converts carbon to oil, recycle the pollution and make bio diesel!
2577 2018-12-10 19:58:31 Low on gas - ok

Need to top up my tire pressure - hmm

Due for an oil change - 
2578 2018-12-10 19:58:28 Venezuela relied on oil revenue to keep its dollar debt in check, didn't bank on economic warfare with the US and Canada. Venezuela got over 70% of its gdp from the private sector, more than the US. They fucked up not because of socialism but because of ineptitude.

2585 2018-12-10 19:57:28 Ohhh yay! Ive been so obsssed with my thives oil that I haven’t tried any of the others
2586 2018-12-10 19:57:26 Yes to the chili oil! 
2587 2018-12-10 19:57:23 Dear Mr. Guterres, please remind the west of its moral duty towards Africa whose riches they have looted for decades, and whose people they have sold for centuries. And, also forget not the Middle East which the west has incinerated and destabilized lusting for oil.
2588 2018-12-10 19:57:16 *Jaimie Oliver voice*: A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and...
2589 2018-12-10 19:57:13 @garyvee has some wise words for those who aren't prepared for another drop in the #economy. Student loans are the new snake oil of our times - thanks to the greed/avarice of big #banks.
2590 2018-12-10 19:57:10 @CL.1 wti crude #OIL back to 50

2591 2018-12-10 19:57:07 Oil remains terrible $UWT $DWT
2592 2018-12-10 19:57:00 This could be HUGE for everyone who signed, shared and spread the word about dirty palm oil. This could be HUGE for Indonesian rainforests, orangutans, local communities and our climate BUT 2/4
2593 2018-12-10 19:56:51 Dems dont need to support just a base.
Problems start from top! NRA, OIL, COAL, STEAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE MONEY THAN GOD AND WANT MORE. GREED IS THE PROBLEM! NOT DEMS FORGETTING THIER BASE!
EASY FIX DONT PAY TAXES TILL WE GET WHAT WE THE PEOPLE NEED.

THEY CANT RUN WITHOUT MONEY
2594 2018-12-10 19:56:45 Oftec are HETAS are not the only competent persons schemes for oil and solid fuel others are available (and cheaper for tradespeople )
2595 2018-12-10 19:56:44 Scots Govt had huge plans for renewable to replace energy needs, so WM pulled funding. Told oil running out in 2014 and laughed at when suggested massive fields off West Coast. 2018 massive fields off West Coast announced. Difference in approach from 2014 to now pretty huge tbh
2596 2018-12-10 19:56:44 Can I take a dive in ya oil sheen
2597 2018-12-10 19:56:43 That's called a "Narrative," which is a political tool used to keep unemployed oil workers from freaking out if they were told the truth, which is oilsands are being thrown under the bus.
2598 2018-12-10 19:56:40 Nigerians are funny sha. Some set of politicians stole Nigeria dry despite all the oil boom and they want to comeback again. While another set is sharing money to the less privilege despite the bad economy . our head never correct.
2599 2018-12-10 19:56:36 Scheduled a doctors appointment and a car oil change today, that’s enough adult stuff for one day
2600 2018-12-10 19:56:34 Why tf does this school smell like motor oil
2601 2018-12-10 19:56:28 For decades, the federal government, one way or another, has been propping up and/or subsidizing the oil and gas industry in Canada. Just so you know.
2602 2018-12-10 19:56:22 Oilcity, a book about a team that defends a floating city made up of several decomissioned oil rigs in Kamandi's world.

#Olicity #Oilcity #potaytopotahto
2603 2018-12-10 19:56:15 Yup...I've written about it a few times when I was trying to drum up support for the book... My personal fave is just a runny egg, soy sauce, and scallions. Maybe a dab of chili oil.
2604 2018-12-10 19:56:15 事故物件サイトかと思った
2605 2018-12-10 19:56:09 We've oil there. It ain't frozen 
2606 2018-12-10 19:56:03 However, I can assure you, if auto ins started covering oil changes and other preventative care, you would begin to see a huge spike in the price of an oil change, as people would tend to purchase more expensive options.

2608 2018-12-10 19:55:57 And people say that he hates the oil sector. Guess he showed them.
2609 2018-12-10 19:55:47 She lays on the back of her head sometimes and i put olive oil on it every other day  thank you
2610 2018-12-10 19:55:45 Saje natural wellness or WHOLE FOODS. And remember . You have to keep moisturizing your skin . Jojoba is great and my fav is grape seed oil doesn’t clog your pores
2611 2018-12-10 19:55:40 Are you prepared to push for refineries being built in Alberta, so Alberta gets a better share of the money that comes from oil? #ableg
2612 2018-12-10 19:55:34 My fellow Zimbabweans i would like to wish a Merry Christmas isina mari . petrol , diesel . cooking oil ne sugar . and A Happy damudziwa year

2613 2018-12-10 19:55:19 Had a 12:30pm appt @ToyotaUniverse for a simple oil change. Was told the car would be ready by 2:00pm. Its 2:55pm and I'm still waiting... #terriblecustomerservice
2614 2018-12-10 19:55:02 @AnaGomesMEP I saw your Tweet regarding Toney Blair Re: Ethiopia. I totally agree with you!Tony Blair is blood thirsty Luciferian who shade millions of Iraq's blood just to grab petrol oil. What is he doing in God fearing Ethiopia? On his next move to destroy Ethiopia like Iraq?
2615 2018-12-10 19:54:55 Nah imagine eating nappies and baby oil hai hai

エ○ネタを持ち出さないところにオイル様の慈悲を感じます(^_^;)
2617 2018-12-10 19:54:27 None covered by insurance. Kinda how your oil changes for your car are not covered by your auto ins. Oil changes are preventative care. It would be ridiculous to force auto ins cos to cover those, as most people can afford the costs out of pocket.

2621 2018-12-10 19:53:58 If u r so outraged at Saudi Arabia stop buying there blood oil and get energy east going to use our oil. Pretty simple Junior.
2622 2018-12-10 19:53:56 I can name 3.  Sugar, corn syrup, and palm oil.  Just about every candy has those 3 ingredients.  Doesn't matter what the candy is, chances are those 3 are in it.
2623 2018-12-10 19:53:55 Oh really? So just wondering, what about providing the world with natural gas to replace dirty fuels like coal and wood, which fume induced illnesses kill up to 4 million worldwide every year? You forget there's a lot of those that gas n oil can still replace, saving lives n GHG
2624 2018-12-10 19:53:44 To come closer to home I understand your brains are slow ...You can’t have a degree that teaches you to mine oil in Zim yet when we don’t have oil mines it makes no sense but now that oil has been discovered you might go to Saudi Arabia to acquire those skills and bring em home
2625 2018-12-10 19:53:42 Miguel is cute, but......ain’t no oil on that thoak. You can’t sit with Usher and Durrell Babs without it.
2626 2018-12-10 19:53:29 Jojoba >>>

But if you have sensitive skin that tea tree oil might still burn
2627 2018-12-10 19:53:22 Mr. Kenney, the key part of your first tweet is “in part to Alberta’s oil industry.”  •in part•  Alberta is not the only factor in determining transfer payments. IMO, some of the inequities could have been addressed before you were in provincial politics. #ableg
2628 2018-12-10 19:53:15 The problem is that the companies involved can't afford to bribe DougFraud like the oil and automobile companies can.
2629 2018-12-10 19:53:14 In line with OPEC’s recent decision, #ADNOC has notified customers that January 2019 crude oil allocations will be reduced as follows: Murban 15%, Das 5% and Upper Zakum 5%

2631 2018-12-10 19:53:07 Few things I'm disappointed abt @narendramodi policies.
1. No Ram Mandir
2. One time Center/State elections all together
3. Oil under GST
4. Cap mkt reformation, like change of financial yr & timings etc to meet global standards.
5. controlling Big fishes eating small businesses

2634 2018-12-10 19:52:51 Why no bounce in oil Martin???
2635 2018-12-10 19:52:51 Red vests for Canadians protests!

This psychotic fu*king PM bought an unfinished oil pipeline with our money thereby CHAINING US to creating more of the very carbon emissions WE’RE TRYING TO AVOID!!! 

And now Justin’s twilight zone idea is to UP THE TAXES ON C.E.’s! Treasonous!
2636 2018-12-10 19:52:46 This thread is exactly why i oppose pipelines coming from Alberta. People from oil country piss me off with their anti-Quebec rhetoric.
2637 2018-12-10 19:52:46 Yes, the fact that I've worked hard enough in my twenties and early thirties to allow a comfortable life of stress free video games means I'm an infantile simpleton.  Sad to say I never had the pleasure of being afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome.  It sounds stressful.
2638 2018-12-10 19:52:42 I hate car dealerships man esp when my anxiety is very high rn and they tell me about $1000 worth of stuff wrong with my car and I went to go for an oil change wtf  but my dad said they like to do that so he’s gonna look over my car too
2639 2018-12-10 19:52:42 I can’t tell if you’re being condescending or not
2640 2018-12-10 19:52:41 Julie don’t fall for the fake products they sell in the pharmacy or any dermatologist lol , go for natural safe products . Try lavender and see how it works for you . Add some grape seed oil or jojoba
2641 2018-12-10 19:52:40 rosehip oil maybe!
2642 2018-12-10 19:52:33 Is it? Well, big oil, the corporate entities which control the market have voted with their $$'s and guess who won? Oilsands, which is why they're being systematically dismantled.
2643 2018-12-10 19:52:32 No one knows how much energy we need. What we all need to survive is to put an oil company out of business.

2645 2018-12-10 19:52:28 SPX rallying (I was wrong today), but bigger picture this reaction in oil is very concerning. It’s a big signal for growth and more importantly credit in my view. Credit leads. Warning sign for macro going into 2019. Hopefully sets up a nice SPX short entry

2649 2018-12-10 19:52:16 3.) The caravan wasn't fake, hence the outrage over tear gas being used on it last week.
2650 2018-12-10 19:52:14 Reminds me of a snake oil salesman
2651 2018-12-10 19:52:03 I think we've reached a point that people want to mitigate climate change but only have the oil and gas companies and rich people pay for everything while consumers aren't part of the equation. Yes, consumers and consumer habits are at play here.
2652 2018-12-10 19:52:02 So I discovered the possibility that our lotion maybe the reason darths skin is acting out bc it has lavender essential oil in it :((((
2653 2018-12-10 19:52:00 They get more oil and gas from Canada, Trump doesn't knew what he talking about, he want to get more money from them to put in his pocket
2654 2018-12-10 19:51:57 Receiving my car with:

2657 2018-12-10 19:51:52 No. In this country, anyone that’s served in our military gets treated like gold.
2658 2018-12-10 19:51:51 Literally every word of the tweet you cited is leftist-charged propaganda.

1.) Whitaker's appointment is absolutely constitutional and the Vacancies Act gives POTUS authority to pick an interim AG for 210 days.
2.) Children weren't "abducted" by ICE at the US border.
2659 2018-12-10 19:51:50 White peoples use their money , that they underwrite in an investment banking scam, which isn’t backed by gold... its inflated fiat capital they dangle over ur head while their military have murdered.. stole land, oil and theft of every natural resource for centuries..
2660 2018-12-10 19:51:48 Actually, she calls a decision he made “cowardice”. So no, she didn’t.
2661 2018-12-10 19:51:30 Did you know that our oil sands industry n comps r leaders in new tech and innovation that are driving us to a greener and cleaner future? But facts don't matter to socialists.
2662 2018-12-10 19:51:30 Everyone else is figuring life out, me I am at home burning my hands badly with groundnut oil while frying dodo. 
2663 2018-12-10 19:51:28 Add 2 TBSP organic extra virgin olive oil to the pan.  Place tuna in pan once hot for 2-3 minutes each side (or to desired preparedness) basting the non-cooking side with more glaze.  Repeat on the other side.  Garnish as desired, if at all.  Enjoy!
2664 2018-12-10 19:51:26 but @neeratanden is opposed to the #GreenNewDeal. she is a big supporter of fracking and fossil fuel interests. her organization even takes millions from oil producing countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
2665 2018-12-10 19:51:12 Oga I am native of ede and am in ede right now so if PDP have done what aregbe did in their eight years when oil money is booming osun could have been better than this but we that aregbe for making oshogbo look like state capital not like the bush Jonathan wife call it again
2666 2018-12-10 19:51:11 TIL that you can't call thieves oil thieves oil any more because that one big MLM essential oil company trademarked the name. Whatever, I just feel like if they didn't expressly go plunder plague victims to test it out, they shouldn't get to use the name. YMMV.
2667 2018-12-10 19:51:10 I was thinking about that this morning. When GWB was running for his 2nd term I thought "how can people vote for him after the lies and false war for oil?" and it was the war that got him reelected. I will not be surprised if there is a war or conflict "only he can fix" in 2019.
2668 2018-12-10 19:51:06 The point of a carbon tax is NOT to "keep oil around"!
2669 2018-12-10 19:51:02 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.
2670 2018-12-10 19:51:00 @JustinTrudeau I'm in Ontario & equally pissed at liberals....specifically Trudeau. He throws around millions just because he can.All Canada depends on oil sands success of moving oil to market. Losing millions/wk is just stupid leadership. @charlesadler
2671 2018-12-10 19:50:58 Fuck the love and compassion and just be capitalistic? Fight for your own? Don’t do any good? Just go to work and pay your debts?
2672 2018-12-10 19:50:52 I’ve used it a few times but I also asked the piercer at zealous about it and he said that the oil can trap bacteria so idk 
2673 2018-12-10 19:50:45 Watch the close... OIL on verge of bear flag break, dollar relentless higher. Equities should buckle next
2674 2018-12-10 19:50:42 Bloody waste of time. EU are burning the midnight oil preparing no deal.
2675 2018-12-10 19:50:40 It’s simple. Look at the label, if it says contains palm oil, leave it on the shelf.

If our president had an ounce of guts and a backbone, and wasn't a greedy child molesting orange pussy with bonespurs.
2678 2018-12-10 19:50:31 At an airport @WolfgangPuck restaurant having an express lunch. I ordered a pizza and asked for olive oil. I’m baffled when they said they don’t have any. I thought #EVOO should have been a basic restaurant staple specially for WP. #MondayThoughts
2679 2018-12-10 19:50:28 Forget Trump doing anything ...under any condition that hinders GOP Big oil generational kabal interest and Mr Putin who went through the decade long trouble of securing global landlord status over not just Arctic oil bonanza..but Antarctic Future Bonanza as well @EarthsOilCzar
2680 2018-12-10 19:50:26 Quit resisting the governments aim against human rights?
2681 2018-12-10 19:50:24 I'm sure many American energy executives would be surprised to hear that!

I built energy conferences from 2010-2015, the peak of the Shale Gas/Shale Oil boom. Most agree George Mitchell was the first to marry hydraulic fracturing & horizontal drilling to unlock a difficult play.
2682 2018-12-10 19:50:20 I brought my car in hours ago to get a tire change I hope they are doing an oil change too because this is insane

2691 2018-12-10 19:49:47 So you’re saying conform?
2692 2018-12-10 19:49:47 Once again you are mistaken. We are not adding to the burden but replacing demand that would be met from OPEC nations. Canada does it best. We should be proud. Trying to label me as an apologist for the oil industry is one way to back out of fair questions which you can't answer.
2693 2018-12-10 19:49:45 This Enayi just likes to look for trouble. I see her scent oil is working  #AmAjoche #AMAjoche
2694 2018-12-10 19:49:42 There's no arguing here, you are making a fallacious statement.  By implying that bone spurs were his only reason for deferment you conveniently leave out all other evidence.  I didn't see you reference college in your "notes".  Take it from someone who served for 15 years.
2695 2018-12-10 19:49:32 It’s all about the oil They don’t want people to stop using oil and depend on renewable energy
2696 2018-12-10 19:49:24 Bonjour 100€ brut signifie 75 € net
Ce qui fait  2,50 par jours .
Ce qui 18,50 par semaine 
On fait juste un panier de course pour une personne et en serrant la ceinture ou un tier de gaz oil ..
2697 2018-12-10 19:49:19 Jesus I came to Jiffy Lube for a oil change and they telling me about everything but the damn oil  Like damn let me live 
2698 2018-12-10 19:49:18 Also, are or were sponsored by Indian Oil which I’ve never really understood - what with the series promoting green/electric tech. Not really the right sort of sponsor
2699 2018-12-10 19:49:08 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
2700 2018-12-10 19:48:57 No oil patch here
2701 2018-12-10 19:48:56 Palm oil stee giets me kinda trippy
2702 2018-12-10 19:48:55 I have really bad eczema on my hand and tea tree oil makes it worse  but different skin - youcanfind any of these st the beauty supply store OR try Eczema Honey
2703 2018-12-10 19:48:52 It also shows how we're not in control of our own destiny on oil. We're not energy independent at all, much less dominant. Why do we need to rely on a country like Saudi Arabia for the lifeblood of our economy? Alternatives to oil are the only way to escape the Saudis' control.
2704 2018-12-10 19:48:42 This is too bad. You can't make any money on an electric car once you sold it. They don't need oil changes or any other engine maintenance. This is where the dealers make their real money.
2705 2018-12-10 19:48:39 Why do t these climate Rats go and Chew on some of the big Climate offenders like China. Because Big American Oil won't pay them too. #piedpipperbigoil
2706 2018-12-10 19:48:35 Where were you when trump shit on gold star families or the terrible things he said about John McCain. Or the terrible things he’s says about decorated war hero Robert Mueller? Quit being a fraud.

2709 2018-12-10 19:48:27 There’s no point trying to keep up with you,cause you have no idea what you’re talking about.Please get rid of any oil products,get a cloth tarp and go live you idealistic lifestyle.Your phone, computer etc will also need to go, cause you are just to stupid to explain anything to

2712 2018-12-10 19:48:16 Girl you might want to add some blessed oil, spells, and incantations.

2714 2018-12-10 19:48:11 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
2715 2018-12-10 19:48:09 One of the interesting feature of a carbon tax is the assumption that oil and gas companies won't defray the costs towards consumers.
2716 2018-12-10 19:48:05 All I’m saying is I better have a oil in my hands before I leave for MD or imma be pissed
2717 2018-12-10 19:48:04 I think we’d keep the oil rich islands but. Yea. Looks good.
2718 2018-12-10 19:48:03 Snake oil sellers 
2719 2018-12-10 19:47:51 Took Rick Simpson oil at 2am last night cause a couldn’t sleep, obviously didn’t kick in till like 6 hours later ‘cause when I woke up to go to a GP appointment, I was MILES away hahahah, never been so stressed about “acting normal” in ma life
2720 2018-12-10 19:47:45 Bioremediation of a metal eluted soil using castor oil plant
2721 2018-12-10 19:47:45 @ApuhPlayer manda uma salve pra min e mais uma coisa usa o oil fabricator pra gerar Aqua em vês de usar as folhas
2722 2018-12-10 19:47:41 It was " moderate" Kuwait that blocked U.N resolution condemning Palestinian terror group.
2723 2018-12-10 19:47:38 This is a call for unity to guard illegitimate actions of SA. After all, oil makes one slip, and fall into the lap of SA. But this time, it is not going to work. Trump and MBS' nexus would end up in sheer chaos in the Middle East- which is the up-coming goal to be achieved.
2724 2018-12-10 19:47:37 Truth hurts. Fact is you can't stand up for the environment and not support a pipeline that would displace blood oil from nations with terrible human rights and environmental records.
2725 2018-12-10 19:47:33 Trump's affinity for Coal , oil , gas is backwards thinking ,Clean  Green Energy & Green Jobs is the future , progress.
2726 2018-12-10 19:47:32 I mean I can do that too. Congress should just decide "no more oil". Done. Over. Right? NO! It's not possible. This is reality where our president is a moron and Congress is bought and paid for by the same companies you want to take out. Your plan doesn't WORK in reality.
2727 2018-12-10 19:47:29 Elections will come and go,
RBI Governors will be resigned and appointed,
Trade war may or may not happen,
Oil prices may fall or rise,

All these factors will cause Stocks to FALL TEMPORARILY

But no factor in this world will stop the growth of India & Indian Co's 4 next 30 Yrs.
2728 2018-12-10 19:47:24 You may be using too many and it could be drying out your skin. That could in fact make your skin over-produce oil and thus give you outbreaks. Try taking it down and see if that helps. I just use the biore myself and that seems to help me. Haven’t had breakouts in some time.
2729 2018-12-10 19:47:21 U know stocks can’t rally without oil right. Nothing just saying @JoshManMode
2730 2018-12-10 19:47:18 Will is the normal one. Just ask your fish.
2731 2018-12-10 19:47:01 So oil and gas companies won't defray the costs of a carbon tax to consumers now? Have we been missing the past 100 years and how this works WRT to tariffs and excise taxes? The oil and gas companies will gladly eat the costs?
2732 2018-12-10 19:46:58 Quebec blocks Energy East but welcomes oil tankers up the Saint Lawrence to sell Quebec foreign oil.BC blocks Trans Mountain and exports 30 million tons of coal.Why don't you take on these hypocrites?
2733 2018-12-10 19:46:55 That is funny as Obama trying to claim responsibility for our oil production being high
2734 2018-12-10 19:46:53 Just wrapping up some @WoodMackenzie research on the latest tight oil EOR projects. (The Denbury deal was a catalyst.) Will Wolfcamp players start talking about EOR one day?
2735 2018-12-10 19:46:42 You cannot stomach ideas that don’t fit inside a box, then you run to gaslighting like most conservatives that abide by the matrix we love to sit within.
2736 2018-12-10 19:46:37 Dollar hitting gold oil and other metals today it seems
2737 2018-12-10 19:46:36 Reallyyy need some coconut oil
2738 2018-12-10 19:46:34 Tea tree oil chewing sticks will alter the very DNA in the fabric of your soul.
2739 2018-12-10 19:46:31 Imma send you this link from groupon. (Im old af and a penny pincher ) Jiffy lube in cypress $27
They did the oil change, my fluids, vacuumed my car and cleaned my windows
2740 2018-12-10 19:46:30 こういうの最近は、男性の方が体力面で優位性が高く、年を取るにつれて持続力等で段段と女性が追い付けなくなっていくからだと思うようになってきた
2741 2018-12-10 19:46:20 The referendum on Scottish independence should have been extended to everyone in GB then you would have won and now be in the shit due to the price oil plunging.
2742 2018-12-10 19:46:18 What should be of more concern to both of us is that the Tory party is literally falling apart in full view. Whose fault is this ? Not TM and the Cabinet wh are trying to hold it together. ERG are snake oil salesmen even worse than Labour and party WILLbe punished by electorate.
2743 2018-12-10 19:46:10 I make my own from coffee, sugar and coconut oil
2744 2018-12-10 19:46:07 Right, but we are paying trillions for war around the world and I don’t have a sense of consequence. We’re poisoning the oceans but I don’t have a sense of consequence.
2745 2018-12-10 19:46:00 Alaska also negotiated their state constitution with the USA to keep fee simple control over millions of acres of lands that are typically under Federal gov'ts command in the lower 48. This gives them additional revenues, especially from mining and oil extraction on those lands.
2746 2018-12-10 19:45:42 Tony Blair is blood thirsty Luciferian (illuminati) who shade millions of Iraq's blood just to grab their petrol oil. What is he doing in a God fearing Ethiopia? Is he on the next move to destroy Ethiopia like Iraq? Be careful PM Dr Abiy! Do not give foot hold to the devil !
2747 2018-12-10 19:45:32 the goal was like,, oil painting??? i guess idk

2750 2018-12-10 19:45:22 Oil futures settle at lowest in a week
2751 2018-12-10 19:45:20 Sorry,you couldn't pay me to use poly. Use a penetrating oil stain,poly just lays on the surface.
2752 2018-12-10 19:45:18 If someone could get a hold of their computer and get it to stop selling oil for no reason that would be great, thanks in advance. The market has lost 1.925MBD of supply in a week and it is still down 3% today. Algos have given someone with dry powder the opp. Of a lifetime $oil.
2753 2018-12-10 19:45:17 Tony Blair is blood thirsty Luciferian (illuminati) who shade millions of Iraq's blood just to grab their petrol oil. What is he doing in a God fearing Ethiopia? Is he on the next move to destroy Ethiopia like Iraq? Be careful PM Dr Abiy! Do not give foot hold to the devil !
2754 2018-12-10 19:45:04 Have you priced a newspaper lately? 12 to 24 hour old news is great for draining the oil off of fish and chips.
2755 2018-12-10 19:44:54 We all have difficult lives. I’m sure I’m much more blessed than the millions suffering on this planet.
2756 2018-12-10 19:44:47 No. You are wrong. USA needs to get out of Syria immediately. It had no mandate to be there. USA is stealing Syrian oil. And aiding and abetting TERRORISTS. And the branch of Al Nursa better known as the White Helmets. Your attempt to whitewash this will fail.
2757 2018-12-10 19:44:41 Sorry Chalie. There's just no place for lazy, complacent albertans being paid 100K to swing a hammer for oil that can only sell when it's practically given away, 
2758 2018-12-10 19:44:41 Lawd you go for an oil change and they hit you with 193737292938 other issues.. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME
2759 2018-12-10 19:44:39 Ughhhhhhhhh my oil change was so much more than expected

2762 2018-12-10 19:44:29 Never said that. Here you are grossly interpreting what I’m saying so that you can identify me and build an arguement against me as being a foolish young person.
2763 2018-12-10 19:44:28 One bunch of cilantro, stems removed, juice of 2 lemons, 2 tbsp coconut butter/manna, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp pink salt, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast, 1 tbsp coconut aminos (soy sauce replacement). Blend together and then drizzle in 1/2 cup avocado oil until smooth.
2764 2018-12-10 19:44:27 HAVE I HEARD OIL, SISTER? LEMME GIVE YOU SOME DEMOCRACY *sonidos incomprensibles*

2767 2018-12-10 19:44:18 Name another team in any esports scene that has seen this amount of success in 2018. I watch a LOT of esports and can't name one off the top of my head.
2768 2018-12-10 19:44:17 Just changed my oil in record time. Today is going a little too smooth for my liking. Definitely gonna have to sabotage this.
2769 2018-12-10 19:44:17 use teatree oil everynight!! both my nose piercings got keloids and they cleared up in a few days using the tea tree oil before bed
2770 2018-12-10 19:44:11 Anyone else a fan of CBD oil? If so, comment your favorite brand. I need a refill. 
2771 2018-12-10 19:44:06 I dare you to take pictures with Groundnut oil.
2772 2018-12-10 19:44:03 ??? Butter is cream/milk from a cow shaken up. My kids made it in their preschool classroom. Pretty close to whole food. 

I'm not sure they could have made soybean oil in high school in an advanced chemistry lab.
2773 2018-12-10 19:44:01 Yes ooo na the oil go tire u
2774 2018-12-10 19:43:55 But I know what we’re doing now is very fucked up. And it is not good for us as a people. Are these generalizations too big?
2775 2018-12-10 19:43:47 Haba yallaboi having dat avi and still looking for anon are you alright 
2776 2018-12-10 19:43:45 It's *you that's made this country a laughing stock, selling your snake oil to members of the public while filling your pockets with cash!
2777 2018-12-10 19:43:32 @akahana3k 
おはようございます。
ピンソバヒット！
おめでとうございました
2778 2018-12-10 19:43:31 Lol the oil change got me 
2779 2018-12-10 19:43:28 eatin chicken, pasta, spinach salad seasoned with curd cheese and olive oil. 
Almost 11 pm.
yeah i     cant      stop
2780 2018-12-10 19:43:20 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
2781 2018-12-10 19:43:20 Because Obama was beholden to special interests including oil and gas industry. Beto would be a continuation of Obama’s brand of neoliberalism. Obama would much rather another centrist dressed in progressive clothing is elected, he’s looking out for the oligarchs and his legacy.
2782 2018-12-10 19:43:19 I’m not sure I know the best way.
2783 2018-12-10 19:43:18 consumed the cannabis oil, stay tuned 
2784 2018-12-10 19:43:15 Idk love, when I realign my chakras I’ll rewatch and let you know, but my simple guess would be that a forensic audit will lead you to where the leakage was taking place; in terms of the oil. 
Doubt they would be doing a clean sweep of PCJ, forensic audits are very expensive.
2785 2018-12-10 19:43:15 Not sure about these women, didn't watch the video. but the main issues I have is that they keep maybe 10 dogs in a small cage.They can be beaten to death or skinned alive and thrown, alive, in boiling oil or water. That, to me, is not okay- for any animal.
2786 2018-12-10 19:43:11 I wouldn’t say it’s the best way.
2787 2018-12-10 19:43:10 I’m the person who waits till the last second for an oil change
2788 2018-12-10 19:43:10 Vision, vote, tile,tone,son,visit,on,is,it,tin,soil,oil,to,
Note,not,site,noise,stone,set
2789 2018-12-10 19:42:57 Probably a little of both tbh. I’ve had some legal THC oil that makes me wonder if it was decarbed right.
2790 2018-12-10 19:42:53 @francoislegault Justify..accepting huge amts in equalization payments, pouring shit into the St Lawrence and Saudis tankers pulling up to your docks and then proclaiming that a pipeline containing ethical Canadian oil in your province is socially unacceptable?
2791 2018-12-10 19:42:47 im getting my oil change without either one of my parents with me wow adulting
2792 2018-12-10 19:42:43 There isn’t an easy way to adjust without participating to some degree, but by any means I won’t pay taxes to corrupt institutions. Most of the services they provide could be had independently. We don’t need management for a lot of what we could be doing ourselves.
2793 2018-12-10 19:42:41 I like to make my own! Coconut oil/olive oil, coffee grounds, and sugar. Mix all together and BAM . I like to use it after I shave and it smells nice  ... if I’m shopping, the ones from @lushcosmetics are always nice!!
2794 2018-12-10 19:42:27 LEAVE YOUR BED 
ALL THAT OIL GONNA KILL YOU DEAD
2795 2018-12-10 19:42:20 I mix honey, coconut oil, brown sugar, and lemon. Sometimes some essential oils tooand it works amazing!!
2796 2018-12-10 19:42:17 BC is still enjoying Alberta Oil/Gas. 
90’/.  Vancouver & lower mainland’s comes from the much hated Alberta Oil patch....
Except for that Russia Oil Tanker parked at Burnaby last month !
BTW - BC still mines Coal. 
Alberta banned Coal mining. 
Go figure.
2797 2018-12-10 19:42:14 So you get off calling combat veterans cowards. Your service and combat deployments, please.
2798 2018-12-10 19:42:12 Acknowledge that @Ocasio2018 has been elected and is the new representative in the house. You can disagree with her views, you don’t even have to like her, but respect the office she holds... id like to see you try and achieve office like she has.
2799 2018-12-10 19:42:08 Most amazing salad ever= lettuce, avacado, cucumber, onion, tomato, feta cheese, cilantro, oil & vinegar, lemon juice, salt & pepper
2800 2018-12-10 19:42:07 Nah, just needs a new coat of oil.
2801 2018-12-10 19:42:02 shit crying for oil
2802 2018-12-10 19:41:53 Now playing: 'Beds Are Burning' by 'Midnight Oil'
2803 2018-12-10 19:41:49 How is Samosa healthy? Refined wheat fried in oxidized industrial seed oil?
2804 2018-12-10 19:41:43 Make up those institutions as well. I don’t think war should be privatized or allowed to run on as business. We’re foolishly running around to survive on a planet that we are all a part of.
2805 2018-12-10 19:41:34 @EPPETROECUADOR signed a new purchase and sales contract for crude oil, over the medium term, with state co. Petróleos del Perú, to sell directly, a total of 3,960,000 barrels of Crude Oriente, from Jan. to Nov. 2019. #latam #oilgas @petroperu_sa
2806 2018-12-10 19:41:32 Bet they are NOT turning away from alternative fuels or drastically cutting our use of oil and coal.
2807 2018-12-10 19:41:27 My regard for batali as a chef is not high regardless of everything else. Except for the olive oil gelato at Otto. That's fab. Otherwise, meh, esp pasta. Overcooked ! Also, no soul.
2808 2018-12-10 19:41:26 Remember the CIA Orchestrated coup who ousted Iran's democratically elected leader and brought in the brutal Shaw regime. To exploit their oil resources.
2809 2018-12-10 19:41:25 How positive was trump to the oil industry when he told Saudi to keep pumping oil for lower gas. Frac crews are already being fired. Thank trump for that. Lol
2810 2018-12-10 19:41:02 Right now you're being both. Tell me which pipelines CPC blocked? I criticize CPC for deceiving us when they do that. This time Liberals are lying BSing their way through the mess they've created, canceling pipelines while importing dirty oil from Saudi arabia crying human rights
2811 2018-12-10 19:40:56 I don’t think what we’re doing to the ecosystems of this planet it smart in any way. I think we’re quite lost and we’ve lost a sense of empathy world wide. I think that’s partly due to how we have allowed these institutions to collect so much wealth, the individuals that -
2812 2018-12-10 19:40:47 A manlet is a boy rather than a man, often short. Oil of oregano is miraculous!
2813 2018-12-10 19:40:36 This car requires iron ore, a rubber plantation, oil wells, hydrocarbon cracking and distilling equipment, metal fabrication facilities, and 10,000 employees.
2814 2018-12-10 19:40:28 fucking burnt my entire arm on hot oil and it's blistering and I don't have any bandages fml
2815 2018-12-10 19:40:26 バルカロールの平和は俺が守る！　なんてな♪
2816 2018-12-10 19:40:25 My baby just got an inspection , her tires rotated , & an oil change. Now all I need is a full detail
2817 2018-12-10 19:40:13 And they say devolution helps in equitable distribution of resources. Oil in Turkana will never help the locals. Only the few rich will pocket tht cash. Wind project still cant help the locals. So sad
2818 2018-12-10 19:40:10 According to Shannon Stubbs, Trudeau is personally responsible for the US shale oil boom. #QP
2819 2018-12-10 19:40:07 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
2820 2018-12-10 19:39:59 Working with what we've got won't work. Did you READ the climate report? Time's up. You'll never get me to a place where I go "yeah keeping oil around and taxing it is a good idea". We either stop or we die. It's that simple.
2821 2018-12-10 19:39:58 I understand that snake oil was developed to solve the serious problem of squeaky snakes.
2822 2018-12-10 19:39:55 I don’t support these institutions because they have encouraged humanity to compete for resources we need not compete for. I hold a mentality few do hold, and I cannot depend on others to adopt my worldview.
2823 2018-12-10 19:39:55 MCT oil is the best fat you can give your body.  It’s coconut oil.  Is part of bulletproof coffee.  May hold off Alzheimer’s.  Use magic bullet to blend with creamer (I use almond/coconut).  Add to your morning coffee.  Takes like a latte. (Blending to emulsify the oil).
2824 2018-12-10 19:39:50 LOL!  I'll have to look up what a 'manlet' is later...

Huh, 'oil of oregano'.  I may go out later and look for it.  Right now I'm trying to kill it with cranberry juice and orange juice mixed together.
2825 2018-12-10 19:39:45 You might not like his personality but you can’t argue with the record. Economy, jobs, VA overhaul, tax reform, small business boom after removal of ridiculous regs, military, manufacturing, dependence on middle eastern oil almost over, end of anti American NAFTA, NATO paying up
2826 2018-12-10 19:39:43 i’m 4,000 miles behind an oil change lmao
2827 2018-12-10 19:39:40 It would expose the criminal nature of the Saudi regime and its enablers, and shine a light on the corrupting influence that oil money has on everything it touches. So yes please!
2828 2018-12-10 19:39:34 Funny thing when realty trumps ideals eh? From protesting the Oil Sands and pipelines to the stark realization that an election is just around the corner.

and we may suffer from any type of diseases in life
but apart from other things i always include in my diet
Black Seeds
Dates
Honey
and
Olive oil
and never go out without reciting the Ayetul Kursi in my life.
2831 2018-12-10 19:39:17 Oh yeah, nothing to see here.  Treason schmeason.   Pshaww!  Let the GOP write blank checks to Russia and Saudi Arabia. We have work to do to destroy our environment in order to squeeze out the last drop of oil from every possible orifice.
2832 2018-12-10 19:39:13 The continued siege of the coalition forces led to a crisis in oil derivatives, which negatively impacted the performance of media institutions and prevented many of them from continuing #اليوم_العالمي_لحقوق_الإنسان
2833 2018-12-10 19:39:12 Hmm. You seem to be undermining and gaslighting. Let me clarify.
2834 2018-12-10 19:39:10 Not a certain one. You can get the Dr. Bronner's soap from Target and that works pretty well. I've tried a few different ones that I like including the beauty blender cleanser, dawn dish soap (grapefruit) with a drop of olive oil for conditioning, last night I used Zote soap!
2835 2018-12-10 19:38:56 gotta put Respek on the name of @TellYourSonThis

Lately he's been doing nothing but promoting accounts with good content, posting positivity and, of course, providing valuable wisdom as always.

He ain't out here pushing no course, no soap, no oil, no email

He's the real deal
2836 2018-12-10 19:38:53 And he’s a combat-proven, retired 4-star Marine, former cabinet secretary, ...AND a Gold Star parent!  So who’s going to apologize for calling a man of his stature a “coward”?

2839 2018-12-10 19:38:37 I think there are several scents in the catnip/mint/menthol family that appeal to cats.  Mine like muscle cream, tiger balm, and also a face oil that I have with some kind of herbal scents.  Definitely #weirdos, lol.
2840 2018-12-10 19:38:33 Wow...Napenda kushuka nywele yangu then massage it with my oil blend...it's like my therapy session.

2842 2018-12-10 19:37:27 who has some coconut oil i can borrow???
2843 2018-12-10 19:37:25 You need to check your notes again because 4/5 of his deferments were for college.  Bone spurs, flat feet, ulcers, I'm guessing any medical condition that disqualifies one for selective service would sound ridiculous if you were deranged in your hatred for that person.

2845 2018-12-10 19:37:17 Wole Soyinka supports Buhari bcos he has no oil well.

2846 2018-12-10 19:37:12 Time to oil up the guillotine...
2847 2018-12-10 19:37:09 I didn’t read all the responses, but one of the simplest and most often overlooked solutions is to be sure you get enough good-quality fat in your diet each day. If you don’t already, add some nice, heart-healthy oil.
2848 2018-12-10 19:37:08 Saudi oil but you don’t care about their womens rights there? Thought you were a globalist
2849 2018-12-10 19:37:02 Actually the economy in Venezuela collapsed with the oil prices in the 80s and 90s. The GDP grew 378% in Chavez's 13 years.
2850 2018-12-10 19:36:59 Men who wear briefs are manlets. I am glad you came to your senses! Btw if you are sick with cold/flu, u need oil of oregano.
2851 2018-12-10 19:36:57 Fuck that oil change bruh lol
2852 2018-12-10 19:36:43 You may want to inform them of your relationship to oil and gas lobby firm @BrownsteinHyatt. The people living in your district suffering the collaboration with you, the @coloradodems and @ColoradoOilGas already know.

2856 2018-12-10 19:36:22 People roasted gabby giffords for addressing this issue with our military leaders back in 08, but it's absolute fact.
We're screwed if we don't elect reps who reject ties to oil and defense
2857 2018-12-10 19:36:20 Seriously???  Where do you think Alberta's revenue comes from?  No oil=no revenue=no equalization payments.  Get the concept?
2858 2018-12-10 19:36:19 み、みえ・・・ショーパン・・・
2859 2018-12-10 19:36:17 I can agree with this because it works where I live, but it does no good to attract businesses and then burden consumption and production with the gas tax. People won't be able to afford to go to work and production will cost more because the price of oil went up.
2860 2018-12-10 19:36:12 tbh i'm getting everyone their presents from the drug emporium this year. finna give all my friends essential oils, goat milk soap bars & all organic tea tree oil shampoo. it's all about 2019 self care baby
2861 2018-12-10 19:36:12 Oil… still fucked!
2862 2018-12-10 19:36:08 The truth is simple. The world has a hard time seeing what is right in front of them.
2863 2018-12-10 19:36:00 
2864 2018-12-10 19:35:56 @phynofino OIL!!!!  Song on repeat!
2865 2018-12-10 19:35:53 Any number of people would be willing to buy 10,000 kg of oil, especially for such a good price. 4$ gram.

The markets only just starting to get itself stabilized. And The lack of supply atm should indicate there's a huge market for cannabis and products.
2866 2018-12-10 19:35:52 So are we ending Saudi Oil imports into Canada given their track record with women? #humanrightsday #cdnpoli
2867 2018-12-10 19:35:52 20 times less than Nigerian oil? Take off those bigot glasses.
2868 2018-12-10 19:35:43 Beto is a huge oil shill. Who vets these  people? Gross
2869 2018-12-10 19:35:39 I need to put air in my tyres and top up the oil  i cbaaaa 
2870 2018-12-10 19:35:30 I hear it was #charity money @URAuganda did Sam kutesa make any declaration of $500,000 (bribe) as charity money, To which charity orgn. Anyway does he file any returns??? @NRMOnline these are charity donations started  from oil scandals????
2871 2018-12-10 19:35:29 sometimes self care is scheduling the oil change you have been putting off for three months
2872 2018-12-10 19:35:29 Ok.

2874 2018-12-10 19:35:14 Big agree, they dry too fast for my liking, I like working in oil paint but it takes forever to dry
2875 2018-12-10 19:35:10 That kaiju crawling out of the oil fields... Kumonga, maybe? Looked too pointy to be Mothra but maybe. Dougherty did say there were other kaiju in the movie, I believe. #GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters
2876 2018-12-10 19:35:02 Explain to us which part of what he's been doing is snake oil and con artist? The work building 70% support and 17 cosponsors for M4A? Stumping in a dozen states on behalf of Dems, with a higher win rate than Obama or Biden? His Yemen bill? I mean, explain, or stop saying it.

2878 2018-12-10 19:34:48 I think you’re the one with his head up his ass. The govt doesn’t import oil, companies do.

2880 2018-12-10 19:34:38 She's basically Donald Trump with a weaker grasp on economics and no life experience.
2881 2018-12-10 19:34:27 Wrong.
2882 2018-12-10 19:34:19 On this #HumanRightsDay let's spare a moment to remember thousands massacred in oil wars orchestrated by US. Some of which is still going on.
2883 2018-12-10 19:34:16 Which companies have been defended? Most EU companies are winding down trade till EU itself finds a plan B, which is why the want PetroEuros for oil trade.
2884 2018-12-10 19:34:16 Yes Trev, we’re all against you. Wonderful attitude. That’ll really get the conversation going in the right direction. Don’t worry, oil will likely rebound and you can go back to lording over the rest of the country. Until then I’ll just get used to your whining
2885 2018-12-10 19:34:11 
2886 2018-12-10 19:34:06 I thought Meredith was a paramedic in the oil field. She probably even has her own action figure.
2887 2018-12-10 19:34:00 Better to fiddle with oil companies THAN DIDDLE YOUNG BABIES     you freak

2889 2018-12-10 19:33:50 Good thing unemployment is at a 40 yr low. It’s not that there aren’t jobs, it’s that there aren’t jobs in the oil sector. Guess what? They’re not coming back unless there’s world upheaval.
2890 2018-12-10 19:33:28 another thing your article doesn't mention: it's THE OIL COMPANY'S FAULT. they OVER-PRODUCED & flooded the market. they knew what the transportation-capacity was (unless they're incompetent) but just kept pumping & flooded the market. literally. now #itssomebodyelsesfault
2891 2018-12-10 19:33:22 Please don't buy these, they contain palm oil, the product massively associated with rain forest destruction.

2893 2018-12-10 19:33:06 bio oil works great for acne scars babe
2894 2018-12-10 19:33:06 What’s an exploration licence? The annual Call for Bids process permits oil & gas companies the opportunity to bid on parcels of Crown land. If successful, EL holders may apply to @CNSOPB to explore for oil & gas, but no activity can take place without authorization!
2895 2018-12-10 19:33:01 Now we all see, it’s all about her. She needs to be careful what she asks for.
2896 2018-12-10 19:32:59 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
2897 2018-12-10 19:32:58 Oh I am sure that will suck up the 250,000 liters of oil out of the ocean...Slap a few hundred million dollar fine on them and see if that tightens up their storm weather protocols for safe operation #nlpoli

2900 2018-12-10 19:32:39 I hope they can also visit Taknia Libya Engineering in Tripoli and also Arabian Gulf Oil Company here in Benghazi at yung ibat ibang company at hospitals dito sa eastern part of Libya. Thank you so much
2901 2018-12-10 19:32:39 Likely due to population density. A large oil reserve for a small amount of people.  Low lifting cost.  Really is apples to oranges. Cold yes, resources yes but beyond that there isn’t much comparison.
2902 2018-12-10 19:32:38 Renewable diesel is made from 100% renewable & sustainable raw materials. It's not a fossil fuel. It's made of non-petroleum renewable resources, converting cooking & vegetable oil residues, along with waste animal fats from food processing industry, into premium-quality fuel.
2903 2018-12-10 19:32:36 Theorist want to see magic in 3yrs, don’t know where they were for 16yrs suddenly it’s tax reforms, non oil export growth etc, which port you go take do export? My brother it is not about big grammar. We must lay the foundation of infrastructure b4 anything

2912 2018-12-10 19:32:04 Way to go TnT Metabolic Ignitors who adopted a family through Big Brothers and Sisters this year. We happily donated a credit towards an Oil Change for this worthy cause! Looks like they put together a really nice package for the family.
2913 2018-12-10 19:31:57 Yes, there are unfortunately charlatans & snake oil sellers in every sphere of human life.
But to exploit a compassionate movement like veganism for personal gain & gratification is plumbing new depths of abhorrence.

2923 2018-12-10 19:31:17 I think the real mistake was the inability to point to specific shovel ready projects that were going to be funded. Without that, all we had to fall back on was the fee. Pointing a finger at big oil is good for rallying the base and raising $$$, but bad for persuading voters. 2/2

2926 2018-12-10 19:31:06 Anas, what is your opinion on Permian growth? Do you think it can grow by 1mm bpd+ annually? The oil bears say yes and the bulls say no, what is your take?
2927 2018-12-10 19:31:03 So Quebec gets a $13B transfer payment next year, up $1.4B and AB gets a $4.5B lie? Wake up @JustinTrudeau you are killing this Country one day at a time. Your plan to phase out the oil sands is actually working better then you thought, thanks. #sickofthis #leavealready

2932 2018-12-10 19:30:42 So with the price of Oil making it less profitable, you feel that by increasing supply with no change in demand will actually be beneficial? With more product, wouldn’t the price go down further? Where’s the profit?
2933 2018-12-10 19:30:39 Like oil and water
2934 2018-12-10 19:30:34 Really so they are scaring away foreign investment, but I thought you said foreign investors own the Oil Sands? Could you pick a side & stay on it? The whiplash is getting cumbersome?

2937 2018-12-10 19:30:20 U really believe that.  Wouldn’t free for all be what we had when oil went to 28.

2945 2018-12-10 19:29:32 Everyone put down 'mixed race(s) because MOST OF US ARE, like Obama until he had a black oil transfusion to wash out his 'white' blood. Mansions are expensive and so is not knowing what you're doing.
2946 2018-12-10 19:29:30 Implications for international business however. Would require all comms to be backdoored which is a MAJOR concern for large global industries with presence in AU like Oil, Energy, Government, Big Data
2947 2018-12-10 19:29:25 I’m working on that (I’m just 22)
2948 2018-12-10 19:29:19 I'm not willing to let ourselves (american citizens) off the hook that easy.  Every american regime has valued oil/money over lives of all sorts.  This is another way renewable energy and climate change are really human rights issues.
2949 2018-12-10 19:29:18 Solar and wind are cheaper than oil. We’re already there.

2960 2018-12-10 19:28:02 my mom saw a cart on my vanity and was like “what’s this?” I told her it was a hair oil sample they hand out at the mall lmaooo she was like cool!
2961 2018-12-10 19:28:02 Fun fact - taxing oil company profits, while fiscally smart, won't actually fight global warming. You must either raise the price of C02 producing products, or force people to stop using them. I don't see Leftists endorsing either position unless they get to be in charge
2962 2018-12-10 19:27:58 Боже мой, ты только что последним предложением описала моё фанатство по ФТ. Я тогда была на второй/третьей арке, и решила, что неплохо бы сходить на фикбук. В итоге, я недоумевала, кто такая эта Джувия, но уже шипперила её с Греем. Збс, чё.
2963 2018-12-10 19:27:58 Palm oil isnt just in cookies, its in thousands of products in the supermarket. I eat bananas but sometimes organic cookies as well, which contain organic palm oil.
2964 2018-12-10 19:27:53 And trying to make up for the fact that the fracking and oil industry is destroying nearly all drinkable water in the country...
2965 2018-12-10 19:27:44 Brother's A Cowboy's Fan So Same Here Enjoy The Game And Hit Us Up With Those Pics Love Lucas Oil Cant Wait To Go Myself Soon Go #Colts !!!
2966 2018-12-10 19:27:38 @Ocasio2018 Hi Bimbo, the Sunrise Movement people all got to the Capital in car-air planes that use oil & gas- let them walk next time and see how many show up

2969 2018-12-10 19:27:09 A guy at work deadass gave me a vape pen and thc oil for free 
2970 2018-12-10 19:27:07 I'm seeing my friends die, I'm seeing my friends losing children, I'm seeing my children losing friends and a chief that still thinks the price of oil will save us from it all. I don't know what else to do.
2971 2018-12-10 19:27:07 Actually, he isn't a friend to whales. They are dying in unprecedented waves. This imPOTUS is destroying marine habitats for oil and gas exploration by allowing sonic drilling.
2972 2018-12-10 19:27:04 I try my best not to.
2973 2018-12-10 19:27:02 There is nothing wrong with Saudi Management with Oil 

There is nothing  wrong with making a transaction for a barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia.

It is Ethical Oil 

thats the funny thing about it

2975 2018-12-10 19:26:14 We can change this together. He’s a snake oil sales man, very slippery.
2976 2018-12-10 19:26:08 Do your own rust proofing will help in the long run .... some oil paint sprayed everywhere
2977 2018-12-10 19:26:06 2 words that don't appear in your (right-wing oil company) jerk-off fantasy of Alberta's future: "CLIMATE CHANGE" - you are #outofdate & #outoftouch #oldman :p  

also,  Richard Rohmer is a MUCH better writer of political #whatif fiction than you are.  #hack
2978 2018-12-10 19:25:59 Talking like a true liar and tax dodger. Funny you talk about everyone else. How about your scam on the 911 victims. You collected money for them and used it to pay off a law suit and oil painting of yourself.
2979 2018-12-10 19:25:54 I’m already disappointed.
2980 2018-12-10 19:25:45 - oil make my hair feel so gooood 
2981 2018-12-10 19:25:45 I love Four sigmatic - I also drink a turmeric tonic every morning and I swear it's really helping - just hot water with turmeric powder, pink salt, pepper, and some coconut oil.
2982 2018-12-10 19:25:41 With unwarranted assumptions like that I think this conversation is finished - clearly you are an apologist for the oil industry.
2983 2018-12-10 19:25:37 The people of Québec have well understood that the Alberta oil industy's aim is not only to maintain but to increase production. At this point in history this is really not a good idea!
2984 2018-12-10 19:25:37 I refuse to accept a libertarian likes AOC.
2985 2018-12-10 19:25:35 dear friends and haters, here are my top 10 Albums of 2018:
10. Beyoncé & Jay-Z - Everything Is Love
9. Vince Staples - FM!
8. Caroline Rose - Loner
7. Young Thug - On The Rvn
6. SOPHIE - OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES
2986 2018-12-10 19:25:32 Neither is the oil and automotive industries. Wanna get rid of that as well?

You'll be hard pressed to find an industry that doesn't get some kind of government subsidy.
2987 2018-12-10 19:25:23 I’m actually flying out from Texas to see them play the boys on Sunday. First time at Lucas Oil. I hope we get them, tons of smack getting talked amongst family already 
2988 2018-12-10 19:25:10 I’m responsible for my safety and security.
2989 2018-12-10 19:25:09 Thank you for choosing Urbal Activ  Let us know if you have any questions about dosing the multi spectrum drops....and yes they are supposed to be white and water soluble not an oil base to be taken under your tongue twice daily.
2990 2018-12-10 19:25:07 .When #Saddam was cornered, he burned his country (oil fields); When Saddam #Trump is cornered by Mueller & Dems, he’ll try to  burn down America, starting w/ Congress, DOJ, & economy
2991 2018-12-10 19:25:00 It is lack of political leadership that put us into the mess of today - but I dont judge anyone special just now - only to say the Fossil Oil together with eg. Russia - Saudis - US Lobby play a major role...
2992 2018-12-10 19:24:50 I cut just a bit of oil into the butter to raise the smoke heat a bit.  Then after your done cooking the steak you tilt the pan to pool the butter and add sliced mushrooms. Just lower the temp to med while they saute a little then poor over the sliced steak   ;-)
2993 2018-12-10 19:24:45 I appreciate your open mind. I struggle with that at times and display my own bias occasionally. Environmentalists and the oil patch need to work together to set a standard unmatched anywhere else, and it’s only getting more stringent, which is a good thing. A common goal is key.
2994 2018-12-10 19:24:43 How much shit is Victoria pumping into the ocean today? How many products in your home are made possible by oil? Hypocrite
2995 2018-12-10 19:24:37 Climate change is fearmongering and a snake oil ruse, so I’m ok with what I’ve said.
2996 2018-12-10 19:24:29 I need to put oil in my car 
2997 2018-12-10 19:24:28 chopped kale + Granny Smith apple slices + chopped walnuts + golden raisins + dijon/apple cider vinegar/olive oil/garlic dressing
2998 2018-12-10 19:24:26 Dollar rook off hurting oil and gold
2999 2018-12-10 19:24:23 .@realDonaldTrump  Smocking gun?  You are an imbecile.  We all know you to be a snake oil salesman, but you continue to announce your ignorance on almost all topics.  Cannot read, cannot spell, cannot think or speak coherently.  Sad!
3000 2018-12-10 19:24:03 You can see the unstained footboard on the right side of the photo. 

Figures I'd find a way to mess up pine.

Will look into Danish oil. Thanks
3001 2018-12-10 19:24:00 In our zeal to discredit the profession of snake oil sales, we unwittingly brought on an era of chapped, itchy, flaky snakes.

3003 2018-12-10 19:23:56 my grandpa is using cbd oil for chronic pain and it’s working! ahhh i’m so happy for him
3004 2018-12-10 19:23:48 Im pretty sure oil cos knew the long term effects of their industry, and knew someday theyd have to switch gears. i bet theyve been looking into the profit of green decades before the public even caught on. Since they have the $ to do it, they can monopoly alt energy
3005 2018-12-10 19:23:43 Alkuran na barma
3006 2018-12-10 19:23:42 Do you know we in Canada can do our bit to fight #climatechange? That is what we should be talking about, not adding to the burden of climate change. Adding more oil production capacity is going in the wrong direction.

3009 2018-12-10 19:23:37 The green new deal isn't some new, magical plan. It's simply cutting off subsidies for oil and coal and using them to subsidize solar and wind, along with a cap and trade system.
3010 2018-12-10 19:23:35 Yeah lavender oil mixed in carrier oil first x
3011 2018-12-10 19:23:29 I did as well. Moving up to teach riding lessons for the city of Boulder.
3012 2018-12-10 19:23:28 Hahaha..is that the oil that was fast running out during the first Independence Referendum? More lies and deceit. 

The fact is there is an abundance of oil; Scottish oil, which would make Scotland the wealthy COUNTRY it should be.
3013 2018-12-10 19:23:25 @Ted_MRFISHER_ please see to Fowler. I don't even follow the prick and he keeps popping up all over my twitter feed. I may be doing him an injustice but he seems like a right muppet. 'CBD Oil' 'I'm the greatest ever' etc etc.
3014 2018-12-10 19:23:24 Scale is just a detail that emerges after we take the first step of putting an oil company out of business. No one knows whether it ends up being large/small, growth/de-growth, socialist/academic, ...
3015 2018-12-10 19:23:24 Or just stop ALL use of oil and oil products in the Province immediately: that should work!
3016 2018-12-10 19:23:21 The green new deal isn't some new, magical plan. It's simply cutting off subsidies for oil and coal and using them to subsidize solar and wind, along with a cap and trade system.
3017 2018-12-10 19:23:08 For women who have super dry skin, like moi, the Josie Maran whipped argan oil face butter and the Fresh seaberry moisturizing face oil is THE combo
3018 2018-12-10 19:23:02 Some people even add lime. Some cultists even do palm oil and honey. Las las, the thing works
3019 2018-12-10 19:23:01 Mechanic: uh, when was the last time you changed the oil?
Me: I switched it out for Gatorade about a week ago
3020 2018-12-10 19:22:59 cos that's all olishitty has got going for them...haven't had a deep conversation ever cos olive oil thinks it makes him lesser of a man or some shit sknejeididi

3025 2018-12-10 19:22:38 No not the kids. It's Trump's thing.

It is a shreddered old sock soaked in weapon oil.
3026 2018-12-10 19:22:35 Maintenance !!! Niggas forget simple Shit will cost you. Oil change  be like $250

Affording a whip is about long term stability how long can you maintain those high maintenance bills
3027 2018-12-10 19:22:32 Oil sands extraction has much bigger carbon footprint than conventional. If demand shifted, it would most likely have a lower carbon impact than AB oil sands. Reports indicate cleanup costs amount to 260G$. Is it really worth increasing production?
3028 2018-12-10 19:22:29 I don't know what any of that has to do with socialism. If oil prices dropped, they should have sold more. Even better: invest in alternatives. A great thing about socialist states is their access to capital.
3029 2018-12-10 19:22:22 The United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are trying to scuttle a major climate goal at COP24.

Think about this for a second.  Two autocratic oil states.  And the United States.
3030 2018-12-10 19:22:08 Yeah, America won’t get involved unless there is oil involved especially against China..
3031 2018-12-10 19:22:02 She washes it every week. 3 parts cat litter to one part old cooking oil.
3032 2018-12-10 19:21:57 Highlights the issues of loopholes in certification process. Palm oil (vegetable oils in general, palm highest yield) must be used less in products, and where it is used it must not be farmed monoculture. Subsidies paid to farmers for biodiversity to make up for reduced yield.
3033 2018-12-10 19:21:57 I avoid palm oil, soya and beef (vegan) and only really eat home made food which is useful because  you know what your eating
3034 2018-12-10 19:21:50 now Lilah, P & Carelys all wanna hit me up talkin about ... "I GOT AN OIL FOR YOU"

3036 2018-12-10 19:21:36 I'm tired of this human step stool and his vocal choards that are in desperate need of an oil change!
3037 2018-12-10 19:21:32 Are you implying that Trump was apart of the Jimmy Carter pardoned dodgers who ran away to Canada?  Or the guys burning their draft cards?
3038 2018-12-10 19:21:31 If Alberta separated this would be good for Trudeau's plan to eliminate  oil & gas business. Unless Alberta joined the US as a state which would give it  access to a huge market and lots of pipelines to both coasts.
3039 2018-12-10 19:21:31 Time already told. His death and the unrest paved the way for Turkey to start exploration drilling North of Cyprus. Also, that same day, Nigeria announced they would be offshore drilling and that they expected to have more access to easier to get oil than they have on land.
3040 2018-12-10 19:21:24 When government in general is half your entire economy, someone has to pay for it. 
In the end only the people that can't afford to get up and leave the table are stuck with paying the check.

3042 2018-12-10 19:21:11 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3043 2018-12-10 19:21:07 Think she’s got palm oil free jars? 
3044 2018-12-10 19:20:47 Stop it. Calling something cowardice isn't calling the person a coward.
3045 2018-12-10 19:20:46 Minwax stain is crap. Try sanding a portion again and try Danish oil instead. I'm a furniture maker,I've never seen pine turn out like that.
3046 2018-12-10 19:20:38 It still looks like a fursuit that was recently drenched in oil.

It just doesn’t look right.
3047 2018-12-10 19:20:37 Purple oil? For ur scalp???
3048 2018-12-10 19:20:35 Thanks for planting a Rush song in my head. My day is ruined. Please sell me your snake oil.
3049 2018-12-10 19:20:26 The formula is tilted in their favor, they keep hydro rates artificially low which reduces their income which increases their equalization. Revenues from ALL natural resources whether its oil or hydro should be treated the same,
3050 2018-12-10 19:20:15 No oil...no transfer payments. Simple.
3051 2018-12-10 19:20:14 If Alberta separated this would be good for Trudeau's plan to eliminate oil & gas business. Unless Alberta joined the US which would give it access to a huge market and lots of pipelines to both coasts.
3052 2018-12-10 19:20:01 Spot the people that don't cream or oil their body in this harmattan:





You see them right? 

that’s because they are so obvious, with their white blistered skins and horrible horrible legs. Please donate a cream to one of them today
3053 2018-12-10 19:19:56 Niggas think they slick but I'm baby oil bitchhhhhh
3054 2018-12-10 19:19:56 15.3 million people were excused from war for college and medical reasons.  This does not mean 15.3 million men dodged the draft. His entire transcript is available online.  Even McCain said he doesnt believe Trump dodged the draft.
3055 2018-12-10 19:19:52 Wait, I thought she was a barrista. When did she get promoted to mixologist?
3056 2018-12-10 19:19:47 U think USA is doing Japan & Saudi’s a favour ?  at a $ cost ? It’s the other way around - USA wants their geospace to spy on Russia, N Korea & China, as well as protect their own oil interests - wake up !

3058 2018-12-10 19:19:44 Anyway you may surprised that those scooping oil may not necessarily be unemployed but the fact that people like free things (awuf) that may be the reason you see these people scoop. Very bad manners if you would agree
3059 2018-12-10 19:19:38 Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) remained unchanged last week at 649.6 million barrels. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT
3060 2018-12-10 19:19:31 The parliamentary Opposition has dismissed as inadequate and "wishy-washy" the response by Prime Minister Andrew Holness to the findings of an audit of the state-owned oil refinery Petrojam by the Auditor General's Department.
3061 2018-12-10 19:19:28 Especially if you consider we may have already reached peak oil production. We’ll need a lot more fossil fuel if we cool and it just won’t be there
3062 2018-12-10 19:19:28 Yes please do. I can’t wait to see how many democrats we’re take Saudi money too. We already know the Clinton Foundation cashed quite a few nice checks. Let see who else was pocketing that oil money.
3063 2018-12-10 19:19:21 Y'allive oil
3064 2018-12-10 19:19:12 I’m hoping I can get enough oil saved to get my heavy tanks to mk4 in time for the discount!! Either way it’s a Winter Wonderland 
3065 2018-12-10 19:18:58 The best part about getting my oil change is that Gresham Toyota makes fresh cookies and they are delicious.

3069 2018-12-10 19:18:41 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
3070 2018-12-10 19:18:22 @walmarthelp What is going on with your Wilma Rudolph @_ClarksvilleTN location? I went to get an oil change yesterday and they turned me away, said there was a 5-6 hour wait but as I’m leaving there’s only 2 cars in the bay and 3 techs leaning against the wall talking! At 10am?!?
3071 2018-12-10 19:18:22 What you using oil or acrylic?
3072 2018-12-10 19:18:15 No. Just the reality that if an individual supports evil institutions they themselves are probably not good people. Pretty simple truth that offends many.
3073 2018-12-10 19:18:14 as oil took a header
3074 2018-12-10 19:18:14 B/C the Democrats have expanded fracking under the Obama compared to solar and wind power. The DNC  also renege on the promise to not to take oil money.  The IPCC suggest that there's less than a decade to address climate change before temp increase.
3075 2018-12-10 19:18:11 I’m by no means a Trump fan, but the U.S. exported more oil than we imported for the first time in over 75 years. If he can make us energy independent, I’m not gonna complain.
3076 2018-12-10 19:18:05 This is what I thought too but there is an argument that switching to other oils like soya will cause more land to be consumed. The orangutan groups recommend pressing for ROSPA certified palm oil which guarantees sustainability. The tricky bit though is that it's difficult to
3077 2018-12-10 19:18:02 Put sugar in palm oil. Drink morning and evening for three days.

My mom used this for me a lot.
3078 2018-12-10 19:18:00 like... if u can’t bring coconut oil & witch hazel to the sleepover.... don’t sleep over. it’s almost 2019 ladies we don’t clog our pores for NO ONE !
3079 2018-12-10 19:17:49 Makes perfect sense. Let’s use blood oil instead of Canadian oil. Where do you stand on that?
3080 2018-12-10 19:17:37 We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.
3081 2018-12-10 19:17:26 Irving imports oil not Trudeau
3082 2018-12-10 19:17:21 And then Obama is out there taking credit for it! And first time in 75 years USA not dependent on foreign oil. Crickets from propaganda msm
3083 2018-12-10 19:17:21 Trudeau, Butt et al main goal is to reduce and hinder the oil & gas business. They want it closed by 2050. Trudeau can stop the Energy East Pipeline and not take the blame by giving Quebec a veto. This also plays to the electorate. Smart move, maybe not so smart for Quebec though

3085 2018-12-10 19:17:19 Love the history of our seal fishery and how the south side developed after the city banned seal oil processing after the fire of 1846. Who knew the industrial revolution was lubricated using oils rendered in Newfoundland. Puts Hydro carbons in perspective - that's climate change
3086 2018-12-10 19:17:11 I heard about it years ago when Fuel changed but not so much anymore because of the newer trucks can’t burn it. I also put my Used motor Oil in my fuel tank when I service my Pete. Shouldn’t do that either but I’ll play stupid if I get checked
3087 2018-12-10 19:17:11 Why read this work of oil sponsored fantasy? Their claims are not supported by the science.
3088 2018-12-10 19:17:08 new way to embarrass myself as a young attorney: during a meeting on oil and gas litigation, automatically pronouncing the phrase "de-gas" like painter Edward "Degas" followed by someone cracking a joke about me having my mind on ballet rather than law...

3092 2018-12-10 19:16:48 Part of me gets why people are annoyed at Iceland being palm oil free yet still advertising meat but, at least they still have a full vegan range AND no palm oil?Tesco, Asda, Morrison’s, Sainsbury’s are much bigger chains that sell way more meat+dairy and aren’t taking that step?
3093 2018-12-10 19:16:44 Dear Quebec: If there is indeed "no social acceptability for oil in Quebec," then return the transfer payments funded by Alberta. S'il existe effectivement "aucune acceptabilité sociale du pétrole au Québec", veuillez retourner les paiements de transfert financés par l'Alberta.
3094 2018-12-10 19:16:43 He blew 80 million on nothing. He gets his $$$ from oil/gas, voted against M4A, voted to increase military spending 3x. Beto is a flat out loser
3095 2018-12-10 19:16:41 Моё знакомство с любым фандомом буквально начинается с фикбука, где я пытаюсь обходить все дико спойлерные фанфики стороной, но всё равно проваливаюсь
Проще говоря посмотрела первую серию/сезон-прочла весь фикбук и всё заспойлерила-со спокойной душой посмотрела до конца
3096 2018-12-10 19:16:40 Morality is invading another country with false claims “oops” killing few million. Hand it over to corrupt remotely controlled regime. Steal all their oil and resources. Cause few hundred thousands to die as collateral to liberate them. After all that we teach other morality. Huh

3099 2018-12-10 19:16:37 Notes: I am available for chats, hugs, essential oil provision, and craft supplies. I may even have glitter.
3100 2018-12-10 19:16:27 was referring to most of Dan´s posts but yes in this case also click bating people  150K people without detailed knowledge might interpret that as a mass killing within a short period of time, not over 1 1/2 decades in fact.  Palm oil is by no means the only or real root cause
3101 2018-12-10 19:16:27 Nope.
3102 2018-12-10 19:16:12 And why do we earn more money? Could it be the Oil Industry?
3103 2018-12-10 19:16:05 No, Scarumucci is too greasy be a pool boy. Oil and water don't mix.
3104 2018-12-10 19:15:58 BNP Paribas 1/2: #Oil and #metals prices are down significantly this year. For oil this seems  to be predominantly driven by supply factors. The decline of metal  prices probably reflects the softening of global growth.
3105 2018-12-10 19:15:40 Aim MMs have decided that oil from an oil well makes the SP go down. You'd better hope I don't see any at #angs #Brockham  lol.
3106 2018-12-10 19:15:39 They may not understand the oil industry but they certainly know how to manipulate the equalization formula in their favor. Of course they do get some help from the feds doing so.
3107 2018-12-10 19:15:32 Yes, tbh I really don't want to be high, I've had enough Tramadol in the past! I did buy the oil from a good brand but they colour code them depending on symptom so I went for what sounded most appropriate, I might try it again. 
Hope you have better luck tonight! Xx
3108 2018-12-10 19:15:30 I can see the point but I'd question EU will to go through with it, given how close we are to the end of the"oil shortage era". China is different. It sees itself as the successor state to the Western order and is outraged by US unilateralism. China expects RMB to replace dollar.
3109 2018-12-10 19:15:26 @AsdaServiceTeam I decided to have a meal in the Tilbury store fish and chips, it was terrible, the batter was saturated with grease, this means the oil was not at the right temp to fry fish, I usually go to Morrisons for the same meal you can,t fault their,s, back to Morrisons.
3110 2018-12-10 19:15:26 I usually get it in tea form from a local coffee shop, but I got 250mg turmeric oil from Supergood and tried it for the first time last night and it was great! Wish it wasn’t so pricey tho also
3111 2018-12-10 19:15:22 ....... That's the funniest one yet... Afraid of the UK leaving... 
3112 2018-12-10 19:15:19 I have looked into sustainable palm oil but I'm still pretty skeptical. Basically, just avoid everything that has palm oil in it. The problem is, palm oil is also advertised with different names! 
3113 2018-12-10 19:15:12 We should be making deals with Korea, Russia, and anywhere there is oil! Not dealing in arms but industry! Get factories built! Make jobs! Stop places like Amazon, Walmart, and other conglomerates that shut down competitive businesses !
3114 2018-12-10 19:15:07 Being involved with destructive institutions makes you a bad person.

3122 2018-12-10 19:14:40 Almost every other time I go to get my oil changed I get it done for free
3123 2018-12-10 19:14:37 And apparently nor do u until AB economy started plunging. Your govt was anti oil til then
3124 2018-12-10 19:14:27 You would have to understand the geology in Cali oil for this to make sense.  The well spacing is tight because of the way the oil bearing zone sits.
3125 2018-12-10 19:14:20 A lot of Democratic Party functionaries are going to increasingly reveal themselves as Anyone But Bernie people.

They are not on our side.

Don't let your Democratic-leaning friends fall for their snake oil, either. Those functionaries just want to keep comfy make-work jobs.
3126 2018-12-10 19:14:11 Avocado oil mostly. But if I had to pick between the two, it would be butter
3127 2018-12-10 19:14:04 I answered that because he said "you can't name subsidies big oil gets" 

But I absolutely think that Green energy should have more subsidies than fossil fuel, because it doesn't harm the earth on the same ways fossil fuel does. I think that's plenty justification.

3132 2018-12-10 19:13:44 There were huge lies on both sides though. And the SNP admitted they would have fucked themselves. Over reliance on one industry (oil... has remnants of Venezuela), a dying industry and a lack of clarity and investment expose the SNP's plans as clear failure.
3133 2018-12-10 19:13:35 Spent my day listening to @Gastropodcast and now I'm both starving and inspired! Plotting what to cook for dinner that can be smothered in (good quality) olive oil...

3135 2018-12-10 19:13:26 Is there any day that isn’t a day where you celebrate some ridiculous thing? How’s the standing up to Saudi Arabia going? Did you stop importing oil yet? China? What is Canada doing about Yemen? You are the biggest hypocrite and/or the most clueless leader on earth.
3136 2018-12-10 19:13:26 its an easy target instead of focusing on real problems they drummed up support over a silly oil tax because people are too selfish to look beyond car use

3141 2018-12-10 19:13:10 Having to explain to a friend who complains about oil separation in her nut butter that that’s why you use an emulsifying agent...and she shoots back with “but it’s not NATURAL!” And I have to explain that the mustard in a vinaigrette is an emulsifier ugh @stephaniekays
3142 2018-12-10 19:13:09 What makes me suspicious of this bounce you ask?
1. Why is oil not bouncing
2, Did the SNB really move the whole market by counterfeiting more money to buy more $AAPL?
3. Why are base metals getting killed?
4. Why has gold been in a high paper volume grinding fade since midnight?
3143 2018-12-10 19:13:01 Got my car washed and my oil changed for free. The best @Honda
3144 2018-12-10 19:12:59 I think it appropriate that supper this evening is; whole (dead) pig with extra virgin olive oil, followed by Eton mess.
3145 2018-12-10 19:12:49 This is rich “Inexperience and lack of knowledge will only work as an excuse for the dumb shit she says for so long” when you still support the President. Hope all is well!

3147 2018-12-10 19:12:47 Hadn't thought of that nice guy. Unlike you I don't think kindness has to be repaid with intimacy. Guess wanting civility in politics is worthy of criticism now. Anytime you need to remind it of being a beta just hit me up. I'd make fun of you but you do in your own Twitter bio.
3148 2018-12-10 19:12:38 If anything, the idea that gas taxes are a "squeeze on the little guy" is the neoliberal idea here. It's an astroturf attack that oil companies use to trick us into thinking we must choose between the climate and modern civilization.

3150 2018-12-10 19:12:29 Energy East was just a bad idea to begin with. The whole point of the pipeline was to stop the Irving Refinery in New Brunswick from importing foreign oil, yet Irving's President has already stated he intends to continue importing from the Saudis regardless of pipelines. #polcan

3157 2018-12-10 19:11:43 How? Buy more oil?
3158 2018-12-10 19:11:42 Oh right. They just type how the speak. Like you might type darn for down or oil for hole or telt for told  some words are totally different though. Ken means you know. Fae is from etc
3159 2018-12-10 19:11:33 Considering the way they run this country and how they’re tied in with business it sure feels like I do, but no.
3160 2018-12-10 19:11:31 I wish the oil at the top of my head would make its way down to the ends of my hair 
3161 2018-12-10 19:11:26 I agree!
There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil
3162 2018-12-10 19:11:19 I’m not sure what your point is, but Jerry Faldwell or his son are human beings...not Christ. They aren’t any better or worse than any other human being. The model is Christ, not man. 
Luke 6, 27-42 spells it out pretty good.

3175 2018-12-10 19:10:02 Come back to us when you are phasing out oil and gas, the only solution to climate change. Everything in the meantime is just you trying to pretend you're part of the solution when you're part of the problem.

3180 2018-12-10 19:09:55 Well if you don’t clean it up.  You won’t be in the oil business long.  The regulator with their routine inspections will shut you down.  No messing around with them. They will put you on the enforcement ladder very quickly. Proper disposal verified.

3183 2018-12-10 19:09:49 going to have another look at that article. Oil companies need exposed.. It's hard to tell who is donating to who though, unless.. someone has a big mouth...
3184 2018-12-10 19:09:40 "As I recall..."

3201 2018-12-10 19:08:10 More than 50% of Oil costs comes from Taxes that are implemented by governments in the west. 
Some countries like Italy and France collect 0.65$ per liter from consumers as Tax, which means that they collect 103$ per barrel. 
Annually,they collect 70-80 $billions.
3202 2018-12-10 19:08:09 @GovHerbert is in the pocket of the oil, gas and coal industry. We can’t tax those who secretly line his pockets. So he has to push a tax on everyone else. You’re a puppet Gary. There’s a spot in hell waiting for you.
3203 2018-12-10 19:07:55 How do these obviously smarmy snake oil salesmen play you pundits over and over again. Pretty sad. Weak.

3209 2018-12-10 19:07:12 She was a bartender who will now serve in Congress. I agree that she is a mess but has some valid points too (sounds familiar, Trump).

3226 2018-12-10 19:05:28 I appreciate the conversation as well. It’s a fine line between maintaining quality of life and environmental issues. I’m sure there are improvements that must be made, but thinking we can get rid of the oil sands immediately, without understanding the consequences is dangerous.

We’d cripple our energy independence and ship them all the coal and oil we wouldn’t let ourselves use for cheap to fuel their economies while our own energy costs skyrocketed.
3230 2018-12-10 19:05:02 Head of Stena Line was speaking this morning on TV, he was concerned, sat next to him was a leave voter who couldn’t see and problems calling it project fear. I’m convinced you could drop some in boiling oil and they’d believe they were in a cool jacuzzi.
3231 2018-12-10 19:05:02 How did you manage to hold me for 14minutes Ore The oil on your head is overflowing. Sigh!
3232 2018-12-10 19:04:57 There’s a better way to run the whole world for humanity as one. We don’t need oil anymore. Research the invention secrecy act of 1951, Nikola Tesla, and secret black projects. We have the technology now to have free abundant energy for all and a clean planet. Not a conspiracy.
3233 2018-12-10 19:04:56 Need endless amounts of olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, etc. always running out. :(
3234 2018-12-10 19:04:45 Is it okay for Quebec to use blood oil from Saudi Arabia and then snub Western Canadian oil? Time for change!
Also getting equalization payement plus tax money for Dairy while hurting provinces like Saskatchewan, Alberta and Newfoundland get the shaft!!!      Angry in Alberta!

3239 2018-12-10 19:04:21 Insanity doesn't need to be refuted. To claim that USSR was capitalism is moronic especially since I lived through it. To claim that Venezuela is collapsing because of capitalism and not the fact that a dictator took away oil production from the private sector is idiotic.
3240 2018-12-10 19:04:05 coating my entire body in CBD oil, drinking bone broth, and doing healing meditations 

I can’t believe I’m age 40 at 24.

3242 2018-12-10 19:03:44 So they are standing up for Albertans in Saskatchewan cause Notley is in Ottawa pressuring the federal government for a speedy resolution to  consultations and for more rail cars to move oil that has dramatically increased in price because Noltey did something. My head hurts.
3243 2018-12-10 19:03:42 y’all really pay for oil changes .....? sad.
3244 2018-12-10 19:03:38 Imagine never needing to pay for energy, in any form, again.  No more General Electric, no more coal industry, no more oil industry, no more solar, wind, or hydro.  Would be a devastating blow to the gdp, but a great financial relief for each individual.
3245 2018-12-10 19:03:31 Makes sense. Equalization calculates potential revenue, which Alberta has a great deal of. That potential revenue sits in the area between taxes Alberta does collect, and taxes Alberta could collect if it wanted to, but persistently hasn't, due to lobbying efforts of oil tycoons.
3246 2018-12-10 19:03:26 Agree. I installed one of your open vented thermal store designs and a solar array for under £1500 If I remember correctly.  The system provides all the clients summer hot water and contributes very nicely to their space heating and hot water during winter months.

3252 2018-12-10 19:03:02 This is what centrist pundits whisper while polishing their antique oil lamps
3253 2018-12-10 19:03:02 I'll say back in 2008. Bush addressed it in State of the Union I think it was. Legislators in the U.S, as soon as growth was apparent, were starting to press for the lifting of an export ban on oil and gas. Finally lifted back in 2014 I think. Growth really jumped in 2011 bigtime
3254 2018-12-10 19:02:49 Today came with many headlines

- May postpones Brexit vote foreseeing it’s failure 

- Nigeria’s GDP for Q3-18 stood at 1.81% with the oil sector in a technical recession.

- CBN includes fertilizer in the restricted list. You can no longer source fx to import fertilizer.
3255 2018-12-10 19:02:46 as soon as she makes a good point I will. has not happened yet.
3256 2018-12-10 19:02:33 The 31 follower troll is triggered 
3257 2018-12-10 19:02:32 What are you saying to the young people #COP24 who want all oil left in the ground?
3258 2018-12-10 19:02:28 What happened to our Fore Father's vision of One Canada from East to West. Oil and Gas is Canada's natural treasure ,a gift from God. Alberta is a landlocked country. It is the Duty of the Federal Government to sanction the Pipeline.
3259 2018-12-10 19:02:14 We know you’re busy and you need to get on the road. That’s why we get your oil change done in less than 30 minutes! This includes a multi-point courtesy check-up, because even though we’re fast, we’re thorough. No appointment Required.
3260 2018-12-10 19:02:10 Happening so fast that global oil demand is expected to peak until 2040 give or take at 120M bbls/day before declining for several decades. "Lightspeed." This has to be a thoughtful transition, supported by a strong energy sector in Canada or we simply make ourselves irrelevant.
3261 2018-12-10 19:02:07 who knows this?

1 bbl of oil = how many hours of human labour?
3262 2018-12-10 19:02:01 Denial of the truth is the most dishonorable.
3263 2018-12-10 19:01:53 First and foremost 
@PoliceNG  do not know their job. So they abuse the power. Most of them call it their oil well.
3264 2018-12-10 19:01:36 My December/January goals as an artist/writer are to get back into oil painting and to make some short horror comics!
If anyone has any neat spooky stories or pictures, I'd love to hear/see! Trying to get inspired, this is a new genre to me for writing!
3265 2018-12-10 19:01:34 The absolute insanity that you believe oil produced in Nigeria is better than Canada. This product helps pay for the services & quality of life that you enjoy in Quebec. You need psychiatric assistance.
3266 2018-12-10 19:01:32  can't speak for everyone here but I fully endorse putting every oil company out business ASAP

3270 2018-12-10 19:01:18 OIL. About to break.
3271 2018-12-10 19:01:17 None of the sophistry you just spewed is an argument. I'll make this simple:
> You claimed she was a congresswoman.
> I said that's not true since she's literally NOT a congresswoman right now.
3272 2018-12-10 19:01:03 Getting a fresh oil change in my car
3273 2018-12-10 19:00:59 What?  Use more oil?  Isn't the world destined to go to a strictly soy plastics policy?
Pulling oil out of wires seems to save a few pence per pound.  So, cost cutting is the key.  As it always is.  Also, service departments love charging for rodent-chewed rewiring jobs.
3274 2018-12-10 19:00:53 hot oil treatments. hot castor/coconut/etc oil in your hair for at least an hour before you shampoo + wash as usual.

3278 2018-12-10 19:00:43 Is the common good the same as common sense? We're poor, 30% of our finances comes from transfer payments and we're still running deficits. We have to tap all our resources we have to try and climb out of this financial abyss that we've fallen into, including oil and gas. #nbpoli

3281 2018-12-10 19:00:14 Once again, it’s clear you have no idea what the mechanism for the equalization payment is. As for unemployment, much of the unemployment rate in the maritimes is based on the cyclical seasonal work like fishing and farming, like the boom bust cycle of oil& gas business.

3287 2018-12-10 19:00:06 Not really. Cheaper to import. Conversion costs, pipeline costs, glut of oil on the market all make it a money loser right now. No point gettingwestern oil if it costs more and very little return for oil companies who, let's face it, want profits not losses. Difficult situation.

3291 2018-12-10 18:59:48 Why has it taken 2 hours for an oil change .... whew chillayyyyy I’m bout ready to flip out
3292 2018-12-10 18:59:45 In grad school we had to do oil changes every 6 months. PITA if you ask me.
3293 2018-12-10 18:59:43 We’ve lost enough brave men& women in the military defending the oil blood currency! Now @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner provide cover for murder of US journalist. We s/h invested in wind,solar,tidal energy infrastructure70yrs ago.Enough no mores lives&environment for effing oil!
3294 2018-12-10 18:59:28 Edward, the PM does not personally import Saudi oil. It’s imported by oil companies. You can chill on that issue.
3295 2018-12-10 18:59:26 This what happens when you're generating $$billions from oil and have your underground escape destination ready....
3296 2018-12-10 18:59:16 So now attacking Gold Star fathers is wrong? I’d love to see your tweet criticizing Trump for that
3297 2018-12-10 18:59:14 CBD oil is legal pretty much everywhere. Theres no THC in it but it helps a lot with aches, pains, migraines, that stuff.

Just go to the local vapor shop, ask about CBD oil, and that you need a dosage that will help, and they usually have some solid advice.
3298 2018-12-10 18:59:01 Burnt my face with 400° frying oil... 
3299 2018-12-10 18:58:42 Oil market back to deficit

Supply reductions in Q1 are going to be twice what casual observers expect once actual Saudi & Canadian production is factored in. People don’t realize SA is single handedly cutting by 900kbd because they have been overproducing most of the year.
3300 2018-12-10 18:58:34 Yo you’re supposed to just heat the oil up not boil it aha boiling oil will literally burn your house down.
3301 2018-12-10 18:58:34 Oh well then... I guess that's that. Hey everybody, another oil company is deeply sorry for the environmental destruction they caused. Crisis averted.
3302 2018-12-10 18:58:32 The guy that changes my oil makes sure to always do one of those stickers for me to keep track bc if not he knows I’ll forget

3304 2018-12-10 18:58:26 They are just like any other car you know, the only thing ni they have batteries and motors instead of an engine and a transmission. I wouldn't mind using it tbh. Also hakuna hiyo story ya kureplace sijui oil filters, spark plugs tie rods etc
3305 2018-12-10 18:58:19 As I said... #industrylife so it's not me doing the oil change! That's what a glovebox maintenance contract is for... and I hate pump oil.
3306 2018-12-10 18:58:16 What about a program to turn rubber and plastic into oil?!

3308 2018-12-10 18:57:55 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce American style Conservatism to Canada. It's is not news, it is propaganda.

3314 2018-12-10 18:57:36 Thanks! I figured that as long as I have it, lol,  it was time to get the proper beard oil, wax, etc. to take care of it right.. Jeffery down at @HoracenJasper was so helpful with information & how to take care of it, etc. So time will tell will tell how it will look after a trim
3315 2018-12-10 18:57:30 Oh dear.  You actually want to question their use of oil company money.  This is going to get interesting.  ; )
3316 2018-12-10 18:57:26 i drenched my skin in tea tree oil last night out of desperation and it actually worked :o

3327 2018-12-10 18:56:46 Don't talk about development if u don't have any. Even America has over trillions of debt. Somalia has only 5 billion debt which most of them were relieved off. The rest will be finished with it's booming economy and benefits from COMESA, fish markets and it's rich oil next year
3328 2018-12-10 18:56:42 Also this is basic math: You're not cutting the calories in half by halving the butter unless *you are only eating butter.* (Though a high quality olive oil might actually also taste quite delicious but that's not half the calories either.)

Hussein was only a useful tool against Iran, until he started saying ominous things about our oil supply. Then, as he gradually went from mere Autocrat to full-on despot, that alliance vanished.

3345 2018-12-10 18:54:53 I came to get an oil change because I was at 11% 
3346 2018-12-10 18:54:48 The issue is not whether an economy without oil companies is technically feasible, of course it is. The issue is whether WE can get there from here. Of course WE can’t, because twitter gods like YOU cannot endorse getting there by putting an oil complay out of business.
3347 2018-12-10 18:54:46 YES THIS. stop sneaking mint into my otherwise delicious desserts. i am allergic to peppermint oil and it makes my throat swell up and my mouth go numb and my skin rash...
3348 2018-12-10 18:54:38 Wait, you don't have to do that every time you do an oil change? 

Next your going to tell me your box isn't set up so the thinnest lab member has to slide in behind it to push the pump out!
3349 2018-12-10 18:54:36 Have you tried using CBD oil? It's usually a good alternative for most pain meds.
3350 2018-12-10 18:54:36 The world still needs oil.   Fact.  Get used to the idea.
3351 2018-12-10 18:54:28 I think scroll punps are much under appreciated. They can get down to sub mbar if well maintained, and need little maintenance. Oil pumps on the other hand are never well maintained...

3356 2018-12-10 18:53:47 Both have definitely made things worse.  Both of them (and Howson) need to be let go.  Sadly if the Oil keep playing like this and do make the playoffs, they are all staying.
3357 2018-12-10 18:53:42 Side note because I forgot: add a bit of sage in there as well. Like a few teaspoons. If you're feeling fancy you could also toast your own croutons (olive oil & garlic salt in the oven) instead of the bread bowl for a bit of texture 
3358 2018-12-10 18:53:39 I fear the markets will be in a whirlpool. Will not matter top or front load. Spinning oit of control just like

3361 2018-12-10 18:53:03 God, he is dreadful. Even now he’s selling snake oil just to ensure that he doesn’t get locked inside Seumas’ glove compartment again.
3362 2018-12-10 18:53:01 can’t wait to move to a place that doesn’t use oil 
3363 2018-12-10 18:52:53 I used to have a particular drawing style as a kid, but swore I’d only paint for the rest of my life once I discovered oil, n now I’m back to drawing how I used to n it’s just a crazy feeling
3364 2018-12-10 18:52:42 My expectations weren't high. For now, I'll keep my eye on the extent to which he follows through on the forensic audit of the unaccounted barrels of oil and the principle of remuneration is implemented.
3365 2018-12-10 18:52:34 I smoked thc oil during the Christmas dinner.

I took more social risks because of it.
3366 2018-12-10 18:52:31 Sorry they got caught continuing oil production when they KNEW an oil spill took place!
3367 2018-12-10 18:52:27 Thank you!! My scalp needs an oil slick
3368 2018-12-10 18:52:22 It's not really that it's a third world country with oil that decides to trade their oil in something other than dollars then they'll definitely be rescued.
3369 2018-12-10 18:52:12 Yeah but mine usually enjoy a hot bath in olive oil.. 
3370 2018-12-10 18:52:11 AFAIK oil... I've never used a scroll pump in lab, that I know of.
3371 2018-12-10 18:52:10 Caffeine is helpful, along with darkness and some lavender oil on the temples... otherwise I usually just try to take a nap or go to sleep, often times that takes care of it for me!! I get migraines on the reg so I definitely get it
3372 2018-12-10 18:52:08 Is oil of oregano as good as they as it is? Will it cure all of my desires?
3373 2018-12-10 18:52:08 Mary was a virgin but she married a carpenter {JOSEPH}.  you are not a Virgin and you are waiting for a billionaire to marry you........my sister you need a crate of anointing oil
3374 2018-12-10 18:52:05 Yeah a gentle bath in hot oil in a skillet on my stove
3375 2018-12-10 18:51:59 They have about as much purchase these days as an eel in a vat of baby oil.
3376 2018-12-10 18:51:50 But you’ve never heard of it with oil

That was my point. Nothing more. Nothing less.
3382 2018-12-10 18:51:31 What kind of dye? Also, I have some antique glass glitter I think would be an awesome add in to oil/water on the overhead.
3383 2018-12-10 18:51:22 They answer is nothing . No oil 
 No rig no tankers. You need to start testing to see if oil flows. Some say 2 tankers a day at HH is 1p.

How much will #Angus be I'd no tankers aday?
3384 2018-12-10 18:50:54 Thank you so much for this!! I actually just ordered some peppermint oil I'm going to try this! Thank you x

3386 2018-12-10 18:50:38 Would have thought at least one of them should have stood last time. Selling Snake Oil. Got the country to vote for it then ran away. This is their mess!
3387 2018-12-10 18:50:26 Olive oil is the absolute best facial moisturizer IMO.

Ever need something for the body?
Coconut oil!

That's it!
3388 2018-12-10 18:50:23 Brown sugar and olive oil as the exfoliating agent and Nivea light moisturizing day cream. 
3389 2018-12-10 18:50:22 We could quite buying there oil.
3390 2018-12-10 18:50:12 I’ve invested in deep research on the impact of the fuel industry on human history. I recognize the autocracy argument related to hydrocarbons, especially oil and gas, but actinides offer a potential paradigm shift.
That’s why FF interests have been fighting nuclear for decades.
3391 2018-12-10 18:50:12 Watching a big country invade a smaller country for its oil and going “none of my business” is very progressive
3392 2018-12-10 18:50:10 Oil or scroll pump?
3393 2018-12-10 18:49:53 CBD is the calming part & THC is the high part of marijuana. I take CBD oil or Indica when anxiety gets bad, it really helps. So I hope it helps her.
I'm planning to buy CBD Oil for her online. It was $60 at the store...psh, it's  $25-$30 on Amazon.
3394 2018-12-10 18:49:45 I cannot understand why anyone would want to drill in ANWR. It makes zero sense. We're already a net oil exporter, and the cost and difficulty of working in the Arctic is crazy.

3398 2018-12-10 18:49:31 So, can we stop invading Middle Eastern countries and killing innocent people to take control of their oil for US national security??
3399 2018-12-10 18:49:20 Serve with shreds of ham on top and drizzle with olive oil, sprinkling of sea salt and lots of black pepper.
3400 2018-12-10 18:49:17 Or “This didn’t work at all! Terrible! I substituted coconut flour in place of the marinara and tripled the amount of oil and lemon”
3401 2018-12-10 18:49:13 According to the BBC, the two main exports from the Middle East are oil and news about terrorism. Good night.
3402 2018-12-10 18:49:06 We're now having a civilised disagreement because Robb reused some old oil and I can taste it...

3437 2018-12-10 18:46:07 the supposed paybacks on PV are over their lifetime; they are a way to spend all that oil upfront to make it more portable. We can't afford to do that right now. If we are going to use any oil, it must be for mechanical work to stop erosion

3439 2018-12-10 18:45:43 Obama has ALSO expanded federally protected lands and waterways by leaps and bounds, mandated countless green energy initiatives, joined the Paris Accord and invested in wind and solar tech. He is hardly an oil baron. This characterization is really unfair and slanderous.
3440 2018-12-10 18:45:40 Try extra virgin olive oil for 7 days. Twice a day mornings & evenings. 2 to 3 drops if you over do it no biggy it's safe 
Has helped me with a mild case of Tinnitus.

3470 2018-12-10 18:42:13 I continue to say inequality peaked ~4 years ago (with $100+ oil), and has been falling ever since. Awareness of inequality built up over decades may still be increasing though.
3471 2018-12-10 18:42:11 That makes no sense. Energy density is exactly what we need most to provide comfortable living conditions within the material resource limits of a fixed planetary material inventory.
Energy density for uranium, plutonium and thorium are 2 million times the value for crude oil.

3499 2018-12-10 18:40:05 The drop in projected revenue for next year (when previous predictions were that the projected revenue would continue to rise!) is a sober reminder that #nmleg should prioritize NEW revenue in the 2019 session instead of relying on oil. It's the only way to build a #StrongerNM

3506 2018-12-10 18:39:52 What I am saying is we live in a CAPITALIST country and the prime minister doesn't get to DICTATE what corporations do, unless the government is imposing some sort of sanctions on that particular sector, and then Scheer would be whining about the PM not allowing KSA oil in...
3507 2018-12-10 18:39:32 I have to wear pants while cooking with oil...

3510 2018-12-10 18:39:24 Global market dislocation, against free-trade, populism and chaos. Price discovery of precious metal due to constant demand from yuan denominated oil contract instantly convertible to gold and central bank buying.
3511 2018-12-10 18:39:10 It’s such a battle because people like to lie to make people angry because they think it’ll get them votes. 
There are rational reasons why the state of the oil economy is the way it is right now, but nobody wants to hear about the decades of policy that got us here.
3512 2018-12-10 18:39:06 Put the oil back in the ground.. but first can I get a vodka martini before take off?
3513 2018-12-10 18:39:05 I bought this truffle oil macaroni from Aldi and I am already waiting to eat the rest of it. I think I’m going to go to aldi and buy like 5 more boxes before they don’t sell it anymore.

3517 2018-12-10 18:39:01 No hunting. No need for guns. Backpacks filled with some biodegradeable non earth harming oil and spray the eggs for the next few years. No smelly carcasses, no new hatchlings as the egg suffocates. Natural die off will occur in the adults. Much safer way for man & beast.

3519 2018-12-10 18:38:59 you pay to have climate deniers on your shows without disclosing their ties to the oil industry.
3520 2018-12-10 18:38:59 Really??? NOKO disarms, NAFTA renegotiated, appointment of significant number of conservative and fair judges and highest export ever of oil are all great successes.
3521 2018-12-10 18:38:55 And dundu dey sweettttttt!
Kai, I will boycott all Lagos Dundu till 2019....I don't trust them, they might reserve the oil longer. But thank God for Xmas.....they won't be stingy not to have used it all by mid January 2019.
3522 2018-12-10 18:38:51 you mean like the liberals do ... all talk and no action.... we are still selling military vehicles to Saudi.... we are still buying their oil.... we are making deals with China ...both continue with infractions against human rights
3523 2018-12-10 18:38:47 Khashoggi represents so many horrors:

1. Brutal murder of a journalist, following a president who calls them "enemy of the people"
2. POTUS inappropriate personal ties to Saudi Arabia
3. U.S. financial ties + oil
4. Kushner ties to MBS

The list goes on.

3528 2018-12-10 18:38:21 Quebec and @francoislegault are just trying to see if they can get the Oil producing west tied into a predatory access tariffs like the one that charge NFLD Churchill Falls. Won't happen. @PremierofNL @DwightBallMHA
3529 2018-12-10 18:38:09 But they just jack the price up to the 92% of us that can't hardly keep a roof over our heads. How does this save animals and humans when it comes to #ClimateChange ?Everything will go up except income and the world elites just get top dollar on oil.

3535 2018-12-10 18:37:41 Oilsands are the most expensive, dirtiest, and crappiest oil on the planet, so they will be the first to go as the world moves away from oil. Nothing to do with judges or politics, the edict came from big oil itself.
3536 2018-12-10 18:37:40 A recent project had me looking into this, and "Canadian oil, low acid" is a folk etymology. The American and Canadian Canola oil producers' associations both give the etymology as "Canadian"+"ola" (from 'oile' meaning 'oil'); following the pattern established by Mazola.
3537 2018-12-10 18:37:37 Why do you diminish her by a job she used to have. Everyone successful came from lesser means. She pulled herself up!
3538 2018-12-10 18:37:34 Equalization is not based on wealth but on taxation capacity . . . sort of.  And oil royalties are treated differently than the rent on hydro electric production which accrues to the Quebec gov't. It's not the math that is hard, it is the public policy sausage machine.
3539 2018-12-10 18:37:33 Now do trump

3542 2018-12-10 18:37:18 In addition to checking the motor oil, you should also periodically check the transmission fluid. When you do, it should be red. If it is another color, there’s a problem in the system.
3543 2018-12-10 18:37:17 2/? Natural gas was abundant with the U.S finding itself at a point where oil co's were looking at opening the gates on exports of gas there was that much of it. Knew from that they would be a major player. Don't know how come they didn't see that coming on Canada Drive...

3547 2018-12-10 18:36:58 He lied and as a man of honor he should have stepped up with an apology. I've lost a lot of respect for Gen. Kelly in the last year.
3548 2018-12-10 18:36:51 We if we just called it a surtax on oil company profits, but then said we were applying that tax at the pump?
3549 2018-12-10 18:36:46 Couldn’t agree more! Our silence has facilitated this deleterious evolution. Not only are there more snake oil salesmen around, they are given licenses to practice and allowed to call themselves “Doctor”. Our ignorance was their fertile ground .

3553 2018-12-10 18:36:30 That started long before Trump. Again, unintended consequences. The same as arming the Syrian rebels. Things like that all have their downsides. Personally I think we should let the middle east consume itself but as long as they're sitting on all that oil that will never happen.

3564 2018-12-10 18:35:23 Spend twenty minutes and create a piece of artwork that features whiskers, in a science style using oil pastels.
3565 2018-12-10 18:35:23 1/? Watching U.S domestic production back then was interesting being an oil guy myself. watched it growing on a daily basis pretty much since "slickwater fracking" came in back in 2008. It had been growing exponentially...Knew even OPEC would have problems. Natural gas...
3566 2018-12-10 18:35:22 .noo biofuels fuel deforestation thanks to palm oil. Hydrogen and electric are better. Its a red herring.

3570 2018-12-10 18:34:36 Lol! Russia has had proper recessions (hard to miss) in recent times, so was just wondering. Anyway, your wider point re oil prices stands...
3571 2018-12-10 18:34:33 Going off this,
In one of Grahams books (fingerprints I think) he mentions an early civ known as the Olmecs, but any chance of discovering or amy archaelogy had been ruined because Oil business had totally destroyed the landscape around there.
(Could be wrong re: Olmec)
3572 2018-12-10 18:34:30 We have to ask Saudi Aramco why the Canadian government imports Saudi oil?. Or is it a governmental decision?
3573 2018-12-10 18:34:30 Before talking about human rights,  grow a pair  to stand up to SAUDI ARABIA. 

YOU ARE CONTINUING TO IMPORT OIL OVER CANADIAN OIL.  STOP BLAMING THE PREVIOUS GOVT ....U R IN CHARGE NOW.
3574 2018-12-10 18:34:23 So while the rest of the world celebrates #HumanRightsDay, #SaudiArabia celebrates in longstanding record at being the worst place in the world for #HumanRights. But #MBS is proud because he gets 1st place in something other than producing #Oil .
3575 2018-12-10 18:34:20 End Saudi Oil imports then.
3576 2018-12-10 18:34:08 Exactly, it’s addictive but has no real negative effects on the brain that we know of. Also no one has studied oil which due to its higher thc content is more likely to have an effect.

3585 2018-12-10 18:33:40 Iirc that's the iron block push rod V6 which is indestructible, so it might be something with the oil not reaching the engine properly. Generally that happens with mechanical knocks. That being said, take it to an independent shop and NOT where the tow truck driver suggests

3587 2018-12-10 18:33:18 In order to comply with carbon reduction we would have to shut down all oil production in Canada and even then we would not comply. You think this is reasonable?

“Even for someone who understands the resources and potential of the Permian Basin, I can’t help but be surprised by the sheer enormity of what the USGS has reported..."
3590 2018-12-10 18:32:56 I’m fine with you believing in what you want. The way the automotive industry is moving says otherwise and us not preparing for the possibility of less demand of our oil sands is a mistake.

3594 2018-12-10 18:32:34 since the industrial revolution, we have used half of the worlds oil and the sheer power of that has been primarily used to destroy soil and destabilizing landscape balances. As oil reserves decrease, we will no longer be able to undo the damage at the scale needed.
3595 2018-12-10 18:32:26 Every sector has been putting ppl to work in lower paying / student loan debt jobs since oil crashed. A worsening economy looms that even the NDP realizes they need oil.

3602 2018-12-10 18:31:34 You were early in your call for gold.  May have room now but deflation from CB B/S, lower oil, and stalled trade may weaken USD demand and give gold push higher (in dollar terms).
3603 2018-12-10 18:31:06 SA has a big influence on global oil prices and is in a strategic region advantageous for our military base. I believe we do still import oil from them, tho we are a net exporter. SA is an influential member of OPEC, which could give us some leverage w other members.
3604 2018-12-10 18:31:02 1. Russia opens #pipeline.
2. Russia starts trading oil with Europe & Asia using currencies that are not US dollars.
3. Russia disconnects banks from using international payment systems.
4. #Brexit hits the fan.
5. People learn that the US Dollar collapsed long ago.

3606 2018-12-10 18:30:55 I think some of the very first cars were electric, but because of low range (battery life) they switched to oil and gasoline. Now that technology is evolving and getting better they’re making electric cars again. The 2013 Tesla Model S has a range of ~250 miles

3610 2018-12-10 18:30:40 No, but the point I made back then was over U.S domestic and the availability of oil and gas from shale and how that would change the market...and change it, it did!

3616 2018-12-10 18:30:26 But they have the technology to transition. They need to be incentivized to make money through clean energy. Problem is a lot of their wealth is factored into huge oil reserves and future exploration.

Oil prices are artificially inflated by a cartel, #OPEC, colluding together to cut production. Alberta oil sands sell at a Deep Discount to the US, and still profits in $$$Billions.

3622 2018-12-10 18:29:51 Listen I’ve driven on the same oil for 2 years, had a hole in my radiator for a year, driven with no coolant for 2 years, hit numerous things and ran out of power steering fluid. My car is really unstoppable

3630 2018-12-10 18:29:16 This is a fair point. Big pharma has huge incentives to slow any change (as well as carmakers who lobbied against fuel efficiency standards). Until we internalize true costs of carbon to account for health costs and env damage, there’s little incentive for oil/gas to transition.
3631 2018-12-10 18:29:16 Wey body dey shine like this,,

Na 1ltr of Kings frying oil u just waste na na,,

3632 2018-12-10 18:29:15 The election was a month ago. How do Democrats keep getting votes?
3633 2018-12-10 18:29:06 Yes, you are right but they also export oil to them. So the net import is actually less.
3634 2018-12-10 18:29:04 I need to learn that oil it up dance
3635 2018-12-10 18:28:59 Holika เท่าไหร่หรอคะ
3636 2018-12-10 18:28:59 At least na only oil I de sell. I no be jack of all trade
3637 2018-12-10 18:28:58 Governor Brixton Turnbull: DeCrecio!!! 

DeCrecio: hey, so, uh, I wrote an economic plan, I thought an economy that used Olive Oil as currency would work. That's how we do things in Portugal

Turnbull: This is a shambles, a disaster of decorum and discourse!

#BrexitShambles
3638 2018-12-10 18:28:57 Heres the secret... 
Tea tree oil. Castor oil. And @LadyShellyNow line of products. That's the shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, hydrating mist, the daily thingy and the oils sclape thingy lol lol.

3640 2018-12-10 18:28:49 The traffic has a pattern. I work  around forte oil falomo. I can attest to your submission.
3641 2018-12-10 18:28:44 Maybe the rest of the country has caught onto the "firewall" rhetoric, and are tired of being held hostage by Alberta's oil industry? #abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal
3642 2018-12-10 18:28:43 Funding/promoting Islamic fundamentalism, not a problem
Suppressing free press, not a problem
Jailing women for the crime of driving a car, not a problem
Selling cheaper, cleaner oil in competition to our inferior product -- a human rights scandal, *requiring* gov't interference
3643 2018-12-10 18:28:33 Don’t forget to get an oil change and back up your shit in drives. On the agenda for today 
3644 2018-12-10 18:28:11 Idk I feel like if I was actually out of oil it would have had issues before I put the oil in. I still think I did something wrong
3645 2018-12-10 18:28:09 I'm not surprised. I stopped buying their oils a long time ago. I make my own ingestibles now...they're better.
These guys are in it for the money and some are little better than snake oil salesmen. Its unfair to patients, and to other LPs that do care...makes them all look bad.
3646 2018-12-10 18:28:01 She really needs to shut up.
3647 2018-12-10 18:27:59 What pisses me off it that those provinces telling Alberta that we are over reliant on oil and gas are the same ones who are over reliant on the equalization payments that our resource sector help fund.
3648 2018-12-10 18:27:56 How about left over pizza, Almond milk and coconut cannabis oil? Seems to be the fridge gets as much attention as the plants! 
3649 2018-12-10 18:27:55 Believing that butter caused leprosy “Health-conscious southern [medieval Europeans], when they had to travel to northern Europe, would guard against the dreaded disease by bringing their own olive oil with them.” Mark Kurlansky, Salt, p186
3650 2018-12-10 18:27:51 Absolutely BS!
3651 2018-12-10 18:27:31 Reconstituted my chocolate cake 1/2 of which somehow was languishing in fridge ingredients  to good to waste, Pour 1 cup of expresso  2tsp. of coffee will do, 1/2 c. sourcream , soft butter 2-4 onz or oil, 2/3c. flour, 3tsp b.p. 1whole egg or 2eggwhites, Bake in 9" pan, sugar?
3652 2018-12-10 18:27:30 rolled olled logs into Peter’s sawyery and werfed new woodcuts on Paoli’s wharf and ewesed Rachel’s lea and rammed Dominic’s gap and looked 
haggards after lazatables and rode fourscore odd-winters and struck rock oil and forced a policeman and col — laughsed at their phizes in
3653 2018-12-10 18:27:25 In official vote, House Speaker Barras blocks income forecast changes, even with lower oil price. Vote was 3-1. #lalege #lagov
3654 2018-12-10 18:27:22 ههههههه قدني ارتاح لهم لما شفتهم  اول ماصحيت اليوم للامانه ولين في واحد اسمه oil متولجني بحساب جديد ولا رديت عليه كنت سعيد قمت اضحك ع طول معكم
3655 2018-12-10 18:27:22 Also the EPA trains and has ready experts in oil spill cleanup and technology.  Because spread is important they clean up and assess blame and fines and invoice the oil Co later.  The American people pay for this themselves.
3656 2018-12-10 18:27:19 One could also interpret this as he found a middle ground between environmentalists & seemingly pro-pollution conservatives. Carbon taxing is supported by a Nobel Prize winner & major oil companies, & opposed by politicians who pander to ignorance for votes b/c they have no plan.
3657 2018-12-10 18:27:16 You’ll have to ask the oil companies why they supply Eastern Canada with Saudi oil.
3658 2018-12-10 18:27:15 We have been 10 years away from running out of oil since the 70's.  Iran has been 5 years away from making a nuclear weapon since 1980.  There are always new deadlines.
3659 2018-12-10 18:27:12 And that is a country with highest proven oil reserves. Communism is a cancer. It has only 3logical ends- dictatorship or destruction or both.
3660 2018-12-10 18:27:09 Punishing tariffs on Canadian aluminum, steel and lumber still exist. Oil is being shut down in Alberta as pot is set to become Canada's major export. How does that translate into renegotiating NAFTA?

3662 2018-12-10 18:26:44 2000 Buick Lesabre. It's said I "Needed an Oil Change" since I got it like 2-3 months ago, but it had full oil so I've been putting it off. Now it says it was low which is why I put some in. Was just to tide it over until I could get it in. So I got the oil and you know the rest
3663 2018-12-10 18:26:35 lol, well that was specific. 
why not just use, "I'm a voter from Murica and my loyalty to the Dem party supersedes any logic, even if I'm putting our earth and all its people at risk?" 

me: disconnect your cable TV, stop listening to millionaire pundits sponsored by big oil!
3664 2018-12-10 18:26:35 Cruise liners are trying to find a retest, higher low.
Oil is down big since then.
CCL 55.94
RCL 104.50

3665 2018-12-10 18:26:35 We use oil in all aspect of human life - planes, ships, goods manufacturing, cars, home heating. We can't tell mommy to go away whilst our lips are tightly sealed to her bosoms that give us sustenance. Humans entered into contract that this would be our societes' foundation - oil
3666 2018-12-10 18:26:28 #Copper: No position (portfolio correlation at max), but we are just in a 5-month consolidation (2.6-2.85) that I think ultimately resolves to the downside. It will be the same as being short #Oil #Equities and long the #Dollar
3667 2018-12-10 18:26:17 I think he needs to top up the oil in his car.
3668 2018-12-10 18:26:00 The effect electric self-driving cars will have on Middle-East.
Countries, in the Muslim world, produce nothing but oil. They got lucky it was buried under their sand, & Westerners showed them what to do with it. But, most of them have frittered away the proceeds.
3669 2018-12-10 18:25:54 A sander, anointing oil, a 5-hour long pedicure, and THEN the shea butter lol
3670 2018-12-10 18:25:53 High THC cannabis oil made from a sativa strain, a clean diet and exercise.
3671 2018-12-10 18:25:43 The big one is coming..

1. Russia opens pipeline.
2. Russia starts trading oil with Europe & Asia using currencies that are not US dollars.
3. People realize the US Dollar collapsed long ago.
4. Russia disconnects banks from using international payment systems.
3672 2018-12-10 18:25:30 The Government imports oil? I thought that was the private sector.
3673 2018-12-10 18:25:28 That’s a tough one. I’d rather have domestic oil than imported, for national security reasons, and we are addicted in the short-term but it’s so frustrating how oil/gas is subsidized and doesn’t reflect true costs of carbon from healthcare and env. damage.
3674 2018-12-10 18:25:27 Im kidding lol but @LouiR_1017 is slacking so might have to just ask u to change my oil tho lol
3675 2018-12-10 18:25:26 LOL. Bye now. 
3676 2018-12-10 18:25:26 Andy, why do you have such a problem protecting women? Do you not have daughters? Or will you leave them huge trust funds thinking they will not be put in a position of being attacked? The Gov does not import oil,  run oil companies, nor control oil prices. CPC held power for???
3677 2018-12-10 18:25:25 I think that may be your Pennzoil Ultra Platinum 5w30 garden variety oil.
3678 2018-12-10 18:25:15 Me too and I’m as guilty as the next one. But calling names are frowned upon in actual debates. And some 20 year old oil guy just called me a feckless c*nt so I’m a little touchy.
3679 2018-12-10 18:25:15 Came home this weekend to my apt that ran out of oil cuz we’re idiots. Luckily my @Excision lost lands blanket was ironically delivered today

3682 2018-12-10 18:24:57 Four drops of oregano oil in a cup of water twice a day
3683 2018-12-10 18:24:53 But you will take it from Iraq, Kazakhstan & Nigeria. Do you really think the oil produced in these Human Rights abusing, Environmentally deficient countries have better standards that Canada? Can you really look in the mirror & believe that you are not lying to yourself?
3684 2018-12-10 18:24:51 OK sir. That's the beauty of twitter people can claim to be anything and assume others do to. Keep selling the oil.
3685 2018-12-10 18:24:51 Greenpeace had issues with the tpp though- they were concerned that palm oil and the lime would become cheaper

3691 2018-12-10 18:24:35 If you started it then the engine turned off, that means it stalled. I'm thinking the sensor might of been wrong and you were out of oil, or the oil hasn't gotten to the engine yet

What kind of car is it?
3692 2018-12-10 18:24:33 Age 28 discovery. Kale is not quite as disgusting when you soak it in lemon, olive oil, and add tons of croutons and parm.

3694 2018-12-10 18:24:13 @WaldenChange Really like the idea behind the petition. Wanted to let you know, you can also check products with our new palm oil detector. Just download the app, scan the barcode and look out for the sustainable palm oil badge 
3695 2018-12-10 18:24:13 ....but then don’t profess to know my onions 
3696 2018-12-10 18:24:10 Lmao! Oil wey i dey use fry Dodo sometimes 
3697 2018-12-10 18:24:09 “If data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia,” remarked Kai-Fu Lee, author of “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.”

Oh... wait... let me clean that up:

Paul Ryan is just another corrupt, treasonous, slick, snake oil con man.

There, that’s better.
3701 2018-12-10 18:23:54 Even then, remember the pricing they showed for future LNG was way out. not even close to what was predicted, as were oil prices...
3702 2018-12-10 18:23:49 "Participants would pledge to avoid legislation that might divide them:   No changes to oil and gas taxes, for example, no broad-based taxes, and a minimum of personal legislation."--Anchorage Daily News 2/2
3703 2018-12-10 18:23:43 I am with you on that.
I am not blaming the oil industry for making my car drive.
That is why we are so reluctant to see the evidence.
But it is there, we cannot deny just because we don't like it.
We need to be smart. All of us, right, left, Americans, others...
3704 2018-12-10 18:23:42 How do people grow a beard and not use beard oil?
3705 2018-12-10 18:23:41 Well I was taking about OIL but that too I guess

Market rules to why economic figures couldn’t be released .....most who think they know their onions should have know this....
( I’ll admit I didn’t know)
3710 2018-12-10 18:23:31 Will try to avoid oil as much as I can.
3711 2018-12-10 18:23:28 Simple. There's no money up there. Nothing for us to exploit. If there was gold or oil on the moon believe me it would've been different. At the end of the day it's a big dead rock. Like Mt. Everest. And nobody is itching to live there either.
3712 2018-12-10 18:23:20 Oil companies hold the patents on high-efficient fuel combustion engines, they don’t want the current ones going away.
3713 2018-12-10 18:23:15 Yes to the suggestion of essential oils, rub some diluted peppermint oil on your lower back. On an energetic level lower back pain can represent a lack of security/support.
3714 2018-12-10 18:23:06 RT @GlobalEdmonton: Joe Ceci says Quebec’s resistance to a pipeline carrying western Canadian oil across its territory shows the provincial premier’s lack of understanding about the Alberta energy industry.
3715 2018-12-10 18:22:57 Walmart: getting the oil changed and getting Christmas shopping done.

3718 2018-12-10 18:22:28 It’s interesting that my rep @RepBonnie has only taken $2 from oil and gas but she still refuses to sign on to the #GreenNewDeal. We don’t have time to wait.

3725 2018-12-10 18:22:10 Stocks are falling to begin the new week led lower by declining shares of Apple as well as shares in the banking sector. Gas prices at the pumps continue to decline due to lower oil prices, the switch to cheaper refining costs in the winter and less drivers on the road.
3726 2018-12-10 18:22:10 Teetotalers are not in the clear if you use products like olive oil, oranges, or anything else either not available or more costly in Britain. Ok, I am going to butt out of Euro politics now
3727 2018-12-10 18:22:09 Yeah but it only happened after I put the oil in. That's what I don't get. It was running (sounding and acting, at least) fine before it. And it said Oil Level Critically Low
3728 2018-12-10 18:22:08 You should go in early and look at some of the cool stuff they got in there, Lucas Oil is a hell of a place
3729 2018-12-10 18:22:04 I’m thinking of just starting to do fish oil and see if it helps >_<

3732 2018-12-10 18:21:41 @Nigel_Farage just claimed Norway’s wealth is because “they have the fish”. Of course, Nigel, their wealth has got nothing to do with the oil and gas reserves, it’s the fish . . .
3733 2018-12-10 18:21:38 Kills me that CBD oil is a "healthy and medicinal" treatment. Give it another decade before we hear Heroin Oil is great. They'll say "We took the opiates out and it cures insomnia, stress, chronic pain and employment."

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
3735 2018-12-10 18:21:32 Are you being stupid on purpose here? We could give the oil away for free for all I care, but those countries need it to survive, you know, for heating and cooking? That luxury you get to have and can complain about.
3736 2018-12-10 18:21:29 Lucas Oil Stadium would be my first choice
3737 2018-12-10 18:21:20 Carbon Emission reduction tip of the day
Properly inflated tires improve your gas mileage by up to 3%. Also use the correct grade of motor oil, and to keep your engine tuned, because some maintenance fixes, like fixing faulty oxygen sensors, ca increase fuel efficiency up to 40%.
3738 2018-12-10 18:21:16 What oil did you use? Olive oil doesn't work, discovered I had to use sesame oil and of course a cast iron pan. Do use cooking detector caps first though.

3740 2018-12-10 18:21:10 Fall in love with stir-fries: 3 oz of meat of your choice: sauté a frying pan full of veggies (peppers, onions, mushrooms, radishes, zucchini, squash, experiment) in tbsp olive oil, stir in the meat, thin sliced, (w wine?) cook to taste. French bread. Done, high fiber.

Never let it be said that the art of conversation is dead.
3749 2018-12-10 18:19:54 Then the YES or NO questions: 
1-Did #Gadio discuss #Chad #Cameroon #oil #pipeline shares  w/ any other #UN official besides that Ho ?
2-Does any senior #UN official, their family or a shell company in their name own any of the said #oil #pipeline shares?
3750 2018-12-10 18:19:52 Think I do. My comments had 0 to do with eq pymnts. Believe me I know our here in AB has dropped the ball too. But we should support each other in the same country. Quebec importing oil at $50-60 more per bbl than could support our own country. Doesn’t make sense.

3764 2018-12-10 18:18:15 The oil & gas sector in Canada (which includes mining & quarrying) is only the third largest contributor to the economy coming in at 8.6% of GDP. Canadians, at large, don't necessarily buy into the need for more pipelines!
3765 2018-12-10 18:18:07 Kevin and Khloe will try to convince Kimmie "to come along with Bin" and yet as three black chevron oil engineering students put it: I didn't think and yet the MBA offers legitimacy as the dais show already knows:  to be one is to know one.
3766 2018-12-10 18:18:04 As you so eloquently pointed out early...we're running out of time here. We don't have time to wait around for increases in taxes to make oil companies SLIGHTLY less rich you know? We have about a decade. That's it. Then we're fucked.
3767 2018-12-10 18:18:00 giving rights to Indigenous people do not benefit oil and gas when negotiating rights based resource agreements.  Ghosting Indigenous rights in the past was hidden in the leftist concept of 'universality' used by both fed and provincial governments.
3768 2018-12-10 18:17:58 That's what we hope to make easy with the Giki app - just download the app, scan the barcode and look for sustainable palm oil badge. Also check out list from @ActforWildlife at #ChesterZoo
3769 2018-12-10 18:17:57 My graduation is the first time my dad’s been able to get time off work (since my wind band concert when 13 year old me poured a bottle of olive oil on my head because I read ~a teaspoon~gives you shiny hair)
3770 2018-12-10 18:17:47 The people scooping vegetable oil from the gutter are saying it's poverty, stealing everywhere. You cannot trust no one to do no transaction for you without cheating or defrauding you. So relax and upgrade yourself.

3774 2018-12-10 18:17:25 Even the motherfucking oil companies prefer a carbon tax to incentivize lower CO2 emissions.
3775 2018-12-10 18:17:14 Shampoo is just going to dry it out more.... you should try warm water and a conditioner with a lot of slip. If your conditioner doesn’t have a lot of slip try adding oil to it. Work in small sections and be careful.
3776 2018-12-10 18:17:07 Isabel, it has been a shambles from the off....The People Voted.....The Representatives from all Parties, should have pulled together, put aside, their differences and especially Big Egos....and burnt the midnight oil, to wipe the floor of the EU..ENOUGH is ENOUGH
3777 2018-12-10 18:17:05 The party has shifted, but how do you contend with say Obama's approach to climate? activists want bans on fracking and to stop fossil fuel production. Obama promoted domestic oil & gas as part of economic and national security policy, that's in large bc of the personnell he had

3781 2018-12-10 18:16:48 I think the bigger insult would be to give up on wha the dirt farmers and pioneers worked so hard to build for us. To let a despot party ruin generations of hard work. Because you want to take your oil barrels and stay home. No fight them. Don’t run!
3782 2018-12-10 18:16:41 Further, typically, Canada has a bit of counter-cyclical structure -- weak CAD = strong manufacturing exports, strong CAD = strong oil exports. But, right now, you have a low CAD, low oil, and the trade war is not helping it at all as it normally would following weak CAD.

3785 2018-12-10 18:16:29 You can meet your omega 3 fat nutritional needs with chia seeds, flaxseeds, walnuts, soybeans, tofu, tempeh, canola oil, soy oil, etc.
3786 2018-12-10 18:16:14 There was a big inflection point in the early 1970s, when Japan and Germany became competitive industrially with U.S., Nixon ended Bretton Woods system, price of oil skyrocketed, followed by many decades of accelerating debt and stagnant living standards in the U.S.

3808 2018-12-10 18:15:07 every time the media picked up a story where justice was served for Indigenous people, and let's face in past, that was too far and few btwn, it sends a signal to others, mostly in the oil and gas industry with money and lawyers monitoring rights based examples.
3809 2018-12-10 18:15:03 John Kelly is a fascist
3810 2018-12-10 18:15:02 That’s the least of the problem. What will make a man to descend to scooping groundnut oil from gutter! Lord help us!
3811 2018-12-10 18:14:57 And it's irresponsible to expose a young audience to a slick snake oil salesman like Shapiro uncritically. Would you extend "the audience can decide" to David Duke? He just disagrees with certain beliefs about racial equality after all. Giving a bigot a platform is problematic.

3816 2018-12-10 18:14:23 I don’t think the Fed knows if they will hike or not. Thing to watch is the price of oil (WTI), the deficit, cause market may demand a better rate to lend, and employment wages increases, cause it can cause inflation.  

Right now we are testing important price levels
3817 2018-12-10 18:14:01 Canada produces the cleanest oil in the world period yet we buy it from the WORST in the world like Saudis, Venezuela or Nigeria? Why because provinces work to sabotage others namely BC and QUE because we have a weak, feckless PM -Trudeau. Stand up tell them stuff it and be proud

What Obama administration policy led to this boom?
3820 2018-12-10 18:13:41 Why did KM put anti-spawn, devices in creeks near the Ioca port?

Why did they not listen to First Nations concerns both at Bitumen source, the pipeline itself and the West Coast?

Why does Canada not respect our voices. 

This was an invasion of oil and gas interests, imho.

3896 2018-12-10 18:07:56 Jimmy and Baba are inseparable. The anti handshake crusaders are burning midnight oil to manufacture half baked and imaginary rivalry some of us have never heard of. If there was any in the past,that’s in the past. I belong to present and future
3897 2018-12-10 18:07:56 Beto takes big oil money.
3898 2018-12-10 18:07:51 LMFAO mohammed, Mahmoud and shiekh Zayed went off when they discovered oil and realized they aint have to pearl dive anymore

3905 2018-12-10 18:07:05 Throwback to last semester when I tried to get everyone on the essential oil monq diffuser “it’s better for you” wave and then got a free juul and a nicotine addiction
3906 2018-12-10 18:07:05 Ive heard staying super hydrated helps bc it helps your skin elasticity. Along with daily coconut/ vitamin e/bio oil. But it really is one of those things you don’t have too much control over 
3907 2018-12-10 18:07:00 All very true however when existing refineries are used it takes the capital expenditures out of the picture and then it makes sense to use western oil.
3908 2018-12-10 18:06:58 instead of phasing out oil it looks like we should be phasing out money losing Quebec and replace it with one that makes money. Every year its the same, time for most of them to move to another province.
3909 2018-12-10 18:06:50 Because they have oil wells

3911 2018-12-10 18:06:48 Apparently Cdn oil stocks were recently falling & dividends cut mostly due to record low WCS differentials. Now WCS rallied and is trading over $38/bbl BUT stocks haven’t rallied and cut dividends not reinstated. Falling knife or death spiral?
3912 2018-12-10 18:06:47 In the 70s Ottawa had programs (NEP) to impact the price of AB oil, and the prov said mind your own biz.  Now AB wants Ottawa to put into place programs (pipelines) to impact the price of AB oil.   Is the price of AB oil a national matter needing Ottawa involvement or not?

3915 2018-12-10 18:06:36 Imagine running out of oil this time of year ....... 
3916 2018-12-10 18:06:31 Put my green juice right next to a bottle of olive oil while I was making lunch. So that was almost the most Italian thing I’ve ever done
3917 2018-12-10 18:06:28 What essential oil is best for coping with your perverted uncle at Christmas dinner
3918 2018-12-10 18:06:27 There’s some suggestions in the replies. Peppermint oil does help. I should start carrying it with me .
3919 2018-12-10 18:06:22 I actually hate this girl and she’s become much more smug over last few days. This won’t end like she thinks it will.
3920 2018-12-10 18:06:18 She hasn't been inaugurated yet
3921 2018-12-10 18:06:18 If I was going on a ferry, I would have only tried to crash it into David's oil rig
3922 2018-12-10 18:06:15 Ocascio-Cortez owes us an IQ over 80.
3923 2018-12-10 18:06:07 Way to go Mr Trump, Stock Markets crashing, Oil price falling to the point where your own countrymen are losing there jobs. Add to the money and jobs lost due to your method of negotiation with China. You are also guilty of Market Manipulation with your 'Tweets'...ridiculous.
3924 2018-12-10 18:06:03 Brought my car in twice this year (oil change, etc), was told my brakes were fine and I had nothing to worry about. 

Bring them in today because I heard a grinding in the front left side and now all of a sudden I need them replaced and it's going to cost $650.


3925 2018-12-10 18:05:59 I never would have thought I'd mess up my car by putting oil in it.

More specifically, it said "Add Oil" on the dash, so I added the kind it took (it said on the cap, also looked it up) and put it in the right tank. 

Now it sound like baseballs in a dryer and check engine light
3926 2018-12-10 18:05:54 $cann.c Have any idea who is gonna buy those 10000kg of oil in 2019?...we have a Nestle guy on the board...
3927 2018-12-10 18:05:48 I didn't say a thing about division sir. We should be separated into regions. From that understanding, we would be more productive. Instead of depending on oil.
3928 2018-12-10 18:05:47 It is not quite that simple.
 
Climate breakdown is a side-effect caused through over-consumption & exploitation of oil & resources through Capitalism. 

Vastly more aid is needed to prevent famine, mass migration, war, mass extinctions & potentially Pan Global Economic Collapse.
3929 2018-12-10 18:05:45 Youre right enuh, but you also know how nuance is used as a weapon in JA. All the people hear/care about is "cake" "party" "oil" "teef". He dug his own grave.
3930 2018-12-10 18:05:36 เออ จริงงงง 555555
3931 2018-12-10 18:05:34 The same general that was not afforded the decency of announcing his resignation and was fired on Twitter by Donald J Trump ?
3932 2018-12-10 18:05:33 With all the shouting about oil, I have no idea what the state of Canada's LNG is.
3933 2018-12-10 18:05:25 Apparently Cdn oil stocks were recently falling & dividends cut mostly due to record low WCS differentials. Now WCS rallied and is trading over $38/bbl BUT stocks haven’t rallied and cut dividends not reinstated. Falling knife or death spiral?
3934 2018-12-10 18:05:21 G.D.P. value for money. It's contribution to economy have sky rocketed with oil discovery. Why not pump some cash unto their misery.
3935 2018-12-10 18:05:09 I bought 3 at @CHarperAutoGrp, it took 7 hours to do paper work on my last one, prearranged deal.  No thanks and then they sent me 1 oil change that already expired!  Cam backing you on charities & got you 1000 of votes Payton Man of the Year award. But can't not support this!
3936 2018-12-10 18:05:08 All I am saying is let’s put away the anointing oil. First year player.
3937 2018-12-10 18:05:05 That is fantastic news. I can respect that. Alberta will find a route to ship it’s oil and if we keep the money in Alberta we will be fine. The world needs what we produce and in time we will find a place to take it.
3938 2018-12-10 18:05:03 Like ANWR oil or fusion generators, it's always ten years away.
3939 2018-12-10 18:05:02 Apparently Cdn oil stocks were recently falling & dividends cut mostly due to record low WCS differentials. Now WCS rallied and is trading over $38/bbl BUT stocks haven’t rallied and cut dividends not reinstated. Falling knife or death spiral?

3942 2018-12-10 18:04:43 @phynofino Ref. lyilu lfe and oil. Where's your incredible rhythm gone? 
3943 2018-12-10 18:04:40 Correct ! HVO is a proces technology suited for high end Biofuels such as JetFuel & Road diesel- and indeed for certain small vessels that use “Diesel” The cool thing here that we were able to use a low tech process (Bio Fuel Oil) that is able to compete with Fossil Fuel Oil.
3944 2018-12-10 18:04:37 When did AOC’s stupidity transition from uninformed naïveté to  arrogant hubris?
3945 2018-12-10 18:04:22 Coconut oil.  Leave in conditioner.  Letting your hair get really greasy in between washes.
3946 2018-12-10 18:04:14 Still think it’s so awesome my aunt texted me she was at my moms with a present for me and it was a 60$ gram of oil 
3947 2018-12-10 18:04:12 Trudeau is not interested in anything that improves Canadians lives. He has been destroying the economy, oil industry and spending money for the UN Agenda and Funding Terrorist!!
3948 2018-12-10 18:04:09 I’m attracted to men that know how to handle their own business. I know we’re still young but do you know how to pay bills, do you have a good credit score, can you change my oil, etc? I want a man that can teach me something. I tired of being the teacher .
3949 2018-12-10 18:04:09 Preciso de 40 mil emprestado. Pago 1,2 milhões.
3950 2018-12-10 18:03:59 Streams from the river in which the roots of the Tree of Life are spread and the anointing oil that replenish the Garden of Eden flow down to the righteous and join together in the sea of wisdom.

When wicked interfere, the blessings are not felt and judgement is awakened.
3951 2018-12-10 18:03:54 8 months a year is not forever, true. All I'm saying is that "more farmland" is hardly a substitute for the hit that our country (mainly Alberta and Saskatchewan) are taking in the oil patch. But I'm no expert: if your thesis is that more farmland is a solution, let's hear how.
3952 2018-12-10 18:03:43 Bull.
Pittsburgh didn't discover oil; it was discovered way north of Pittsburgh between Pittsburgh and Erie.
Hint: how did Oil City get that name?
3953 2018-12-10 18:03:42 I bet he uses a lot of OIL in his dishes.
3954 2018-12-10 18:03:42 how long are @IcelandFoods gonna milk this orangutan crap while simultaneously promoting animal products and ‘having a turkey & pigs in blankets but also palm oil free’ christmas bc i’m tired
3955 2018-12-10 18:03:35 He has the rubbery smile of a snake oil salesman.  That was my biggest clue about the oncoming con.
3956 2018-12-10 18:03:35 Good, finally someones acting on this thing! No palm oil no more!
3957 2018-12-10 18:03:29 All this time I thought she was a barista.
3958 2018-12-10 18:03:06 The country that voted 62% remain. And the oil keeps coming, thanks for asking.
3959 2018-12-10 18:03:05 i'm pretty convinced Representive Elect Ocasio doesn't/couldn't/wouldn't amount to a blemish on General Kelly's backside or mine for that matter.
3960 2018-12-10 18:03:02 To prevent rust during storage, rub a small amount of oil on metal tools and bikes, etc.
3961 2018-12-10 18:02:43 ตามจิกหัวสิ 555 ล้อกันจนทุกวันนี้อ่ะ ตั้งแต่ ม1 มันเคยบอกว่าจะทำนมอ่ะ 5555
3962 2018-12-10 18:02:40 STOP making some losers opinion news. Who cares?
3963 2018-12-10 18:02:36 One option is to eat a lot less solid fat, less palm oil, cottonseed oil, butter, lard. They all take space to produce. And the Earth's population is not shrinking. We will need more.
3964 2018-12-10 18:02:22 Apparently Cdn oil stocks were recently falling & dividends cut mostly due to record low WCS differentials. Now WCS rallied and is trading over $38/bbl BUT stocks haven’t rallied and cut dividends not reinstated. Falling knife or death spiral?
3965 2018-12-10 18:02:19 Oil is a dirty word today, but the olive oil used for light in ancient times is a renewable energy source.
3966 2018-12-10 18:02:11 7 million dems, oil for the machine?
3967 2018-12-10 18:02:10 Its like a mile long train of oil cars that has lost its brakes in the hills and is heading for Trumptown. "Flee! Flee for your lives!"
3968 2018-12-10 18:02:06 She’s extremist 
3969 2018-12-10 18:02:02 The word coward should never be used towards someone who has put his life on the line for you @Ocasio2018 and every American! It’s shameful and disrespectful.
3970 2018-12-10 18:01:58 If so, you nailed it. Kelly will never get his untarnished reputation back. But you Cons keel trying to turn Occasio into a punchline. It’s working out swimmingly for you guys in roughly 80 percent of America.
3971 2018-12-10 18:01:56 Over £18 million invested in coal, oil and gas not acceptable to go to the cinema by yourself?
3972 2018-12-10 18:01:43 Yeah Anna! You tell em!
3973 2018-12-10 18:01:30 Given the amount of vegetable oil the world uses in commercial banking, palm oil produces a lot of oil on less land than some others. We just eat a lot of commercial baking. Extensive monoculture of any plant devastates native ecosystems.
3974 2018-12-10 18:01:28 If you still need an oil change, we're open until 6:30 Monday thru Saturday, and on Sunday, we're open from 10 to 4.  8870 Camp Bowie W Blvd
3975 2018-12-10 18:01:26 Your rich sources ?? You made me laugh . Are you aware that if ‘WE’ the ‘Judeo-Christian ‘ civilization have not made the ‘industrial revolution’ requiring energy resources like ‘oil’ you would still riding your camels wondering in the desserts Lol.
3976 2018-12-10 18:01:20 I honestly liked everything I used. So there’s a beard wash and conditioner which is great! Then the oil and the balm for shape and style. I mean you can’t get one without the other 
3977 2018-12-10 18:01:19 Bwahaha! Least the lube/oil changes where cheap.
3978 2018-12-10 18:01:13 @ItsKiprotich @DonaldBKipkorir so sad and soon it will  become the  the backbone of our economy #oil
3979 2018-12-10 18:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or evaded justice.
3980 2018-12-10 18:01:08 50% of oil revenue is.  Hydro Quebec revenues are included, but not at market rate, as Quebec charges below market rate.
3981 2018-12-10 18:01:03 And BTW, no Alberta oil pipeline through Quebec, thank you very much. Isn't that like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs? Absurd.
3982 2018-12-10 18:00:58 And get the pipelines built ! Close the boarder and refine our own oil  . Then we can fly our flag high
3983 2018-12-10 18:00:57 ........แล้วเพื่อนพี่ทำไง
3984 2018-12-10 18:00:53 "Hot water with salt", "Mustard Oil", "Garlic", "Ginger" or "Pepper" 
are good for cough & cold treatment.

Fever must be due to cough, I guess.
3985 2018-12-10 18:00:44 So true. It’s my understanding the oil revenue is a part of the calculations yet hydro revenue never has been included.
3986 2018-12-10 18:00:39 You got to stop picking on AOC, especially when she is making a good point.
3987 2018-12-10 18:00:37 Still many companies taking price increases to start the year as the offset of oil prices doesn't always match timing wise to planning pricing decisions.
3988 2018-12-10 18:00:35 Not even the discovery of oil can Turkana county be salvaged....Ardent Devolution proponents are still convinced that our devolved units make prudent fiscal sense
3989 2018-12-10 18:00:28 CBD (or full spectrum cannabis oil) should help imo yes... as would eliminating grains/vegetable oil (helps everything since they are horrendous for health) and reducing sugar or trying keto
3990 2018-12-10 18:00:27 Bio oil works like magic. The most underrated skincare out there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

3993 2018-12-10 18:00:22 That’s a cool story about 2 people’s former lives. Kelly’s Soldier Above Reproach suit of armor was disposed at the door of the Oval Office. Was that the rationale for raising the bartender turns Congresswoman’s past life? To show how one’s reputation can change overnight?
3994 2018-12-10 18:00:13 Avoid aspirin, products containing aspirin, fish oil, or vitamin E for the first 48 hours after your #BreastAugmentation (or as instructed by your surgeon). These products may increase bleeding and thus meddle with your recovery. Source: @DartmouthHitch #PlasticSurgery
3995 2018-12-10 18:00:09 Their for making money, obviously. Good contracts. Sort of like oil in your part of the world.
3996 2018-12-10 18:00:06 pt 2/2 Then add coconut oil and honey. Put a showe cap on (or a plastic bag) then sleep in it. Rinse it out with cold water no shamp. or cond. After that dry your hair gently then cover in coconut oil and let sit for 1 hour rince again this time shampoo can condition as normal.
3997 2018-12-10 18:00:04 You will burn your chest with oil when half naked.
3998 2018-12-10 18:00:03 Oil by @phynofino on repeat

4002 2018-12-10 17:59:22 Were his comments correct?  Did he ever rectify the error?  If not, why not?
4003 2018-12-10 17:59:20 We have all underestimated the power and influence of the oil lobby.
4004 2018-12-10 17:59:20 Mr. Raghuraman came, contributed for small time and went back for dollar checks. Has no right in being sarcastic or putting oil in fire or politicising it. U r away and should stay away.
Previous Govts no institution could express themselves as all were puppet,now theycan express
4005 2018-12-10 17:59:17 Only Ghana, Togo and Ivory Coast supply red oil, garri, plantain, yams and cassava we buy in Europe while Nigeria is docile with easy petroleum money that is embezzled to our detriment.
4006 2018-12-10 17:59:00 Actually none.  But that would require you using a search engine.  I don't care who you vote for.  Just make sure they talk about climate change, oil money, universal health care and civil rights.  Bernie does all of those, as do many new Justice Dems.
4007 2018-12-10 17:58:51 Used to suffer from acne as a teenager, that's no longer an issue. Don't get pimples anymore but still have black spots and it's oily asf. Shuu you could fry eggs with this oil 
4008 2018-12-10 17:58:50 leave in conditioner, drybar’s treatment oil, and joico repair stuff!! then a shampoo/condinter that has a lot of protein in it!! also get trims fairly often.
4009 2018-12-10 17:58:49 2/Attempting to link Big Oil to Big Tobacco has already been tried. Oakland sued Exxon and Chevron under a public nuisance claim and had their asses handed to them by the court. It's a failed argument that isn't going to work.

4011 2018-12-10 17:58:48 Pure capitalism in late 19th and early 20th century did not fare any better. I.e. standard oil.
4012 2018-12-10 17:58:45 Plastic from oil, bow there a thing eh ? Who would have thought, oil from Scotland eh or is it British aye maybe aye maybe not. But one thing is it’s fae oil
4013 2018-12-10 17:58:40 Roti with tommato curry... little oil
4014 2018-12-10 17:58:40 From what I know of the market by watching my father, a few recessions, bail outs and oil wars over the last 30 yrs, (all of which has led me to romanticize about the 1929 crash and idolize @nycgov) it's usually fear that sets off the game, something Americans have in abundance.
4015 2018-12-10 17:58:37 Maybe a hairstyle that doesn’t require an oil slick.
4016 2018-12-10 17:58:33 S.E. tell us  what you would like to see  @realDonaldTrumpo about this, since he has NO jurisdiction, Cut off arm sales?  Boycott oil?  Remove by force?  just  what  is  appropriate ? What about the 16 Journalist killed in mexico? what to do about that?

4018 2018-12-10 17:58:13 Eye creams formulated with  mineral oil or petrolatum
Many eye creams with these oils use these for the lack of moisture around the eyes.Although moisture is most  needed in this area, these oils can migrate into the eyes while you sleep and cause you puffiness in the morning
4019 2018-12-10 17:58:12 Thank god I’m starting a new higher paying job before the new year because my car needs new brake pads, AND when I got an oil change they were like ‘btw you also have a small leak in your transmission fluid’ soooo that’s cool
4020 2018-12-10 17:58:10 And doubling the amount of oil we take out of the tarsands is not helping. You can’t have it both ways.History will not be kind to you and the federal Liberals.

4022 2018-12-10 17:58:04 Are there any Irving’s west of Ontario? Nope didn’t think so. His original investment went to JDI which was both Oil and Forestry until JD Irving passed on and split the business between his two sons, KC and his brother, when it broke off and became Irving oil and JDI. Anyone
4023 2018-12-10 17:58:03 Here is what is so sad Patricia, bamboo can be used to make most/all those disposable items that are now plastic based. Why haven't we made the change to biodegradable bamboo... the source of plastic is crude oil,  coal and natural gasBig oil at work maximizing their profits.
4024 2018-12-10 17:58:00 Where do you get that? I take fish oil, probiotic, vitamin d and vitamin b12 currently.

4026 2018-12-10 17:57:48 Newman's Own is palm, but to the best of my knowledge, it's orangutan-safe.

Mind you, palm plantations are also starting to replace native forest in Central America. I don't know how oil palm is grown in a way that doesn't destroy native forest.
4027 2018-12-10 17:57:47 And it's gonna get worse. I merely scratched the surface with that list. While we sit around talking about hair and the like, the racists white supremacists are burning midnight oil on the confusion of non-white people.
4028 2018-12-10 17:57:38 You can have all the oil field infrastructure in English waters.. Incidentally it belongs to whichever company invested in and installed it.  The UK Govt didn't pay a penny towards it.  It just took the revenue.  Oh and we don't want the £ sterling.
4029 2018-12-10 17:57:36 As I sit here and watch my retirement savings get wrecked I realize usually it’s a banking, housing or oil crisis. This time it is simply that America has TRUMP,  the dumbest crime family in history attempting to manipulate the US to there own advantage. AMERICA WAKE THE FUCK UP!

4031 2018-12-10 17:57:27 I need a product that works as good as this castor oil leave in but doesn’t smell like play-doh
4032 2018-12-10 17:57:23 It’s already low. I’m at 18%. I know how to check my oil fam 
4033 2018-12-10 17:57:21 Not at all. Do you know the history? Do you know who Irving would buy oil from even if a brand new pipeline got built?

Listen son, if the Irvings wanted a pipeline, Canada would have a pipeline.

4037 2018-12-10 17:56:56 @COP24 All you have been asked is to assess an invention, which creates Carbon Free Power. If you can so easily dismiss that request, it must be easy to explain why for that action. What could be simpler, or is it you cannot answer, or you support oil and coal usage ??????
4038 2018-12-10 17:56:53 I still want to slap him. That smug/dull look of a privileged man who dragged us into conflicts that carry on to this day. Americans continue to die to prop up totalitarian regimes for oil! Infuriating! @TenuredRadical

4042 2018-12-10 17:56:41 East coast natgas pipes are the dirty oil sands pipes of the US. They can't get anything built yet gladly pay $15/mcf at Algonquin when Tom Brady puts on a pair of gloves.
4043 2018-12-10 17:56:34 42 yr old Autumn Harris arraigned in motor vehicle homicide and negligent operation charges. Prosecutor says she told trooper she had nodded off before hitting 5 people, including 3 children. Prosecutor also says Harris told police she had vapped CBD oil earlier in the day.
4044 2018-12-10 17:56:28 Venezuela has/had the potential to be RICH AF because of their oil reserves, forests, etc. But now, they are a Socialist (Communist) hell-hole.

They're eating dogs, cats, and rats over there. Why the F would we want to adopt a similar system of governance here in the U.S.?
4045 2018-12-10 17:56:23 Human lives are more important than oil. The Saudis are murderous thugs who need to be sanctioned.

4050 2018-12-10 17:55:59 @BustilloM Lynn Cook recommends that we contact you. It concerns oil & trades. The chronicle did an article on us in the past; a joint venture between Euell Energy and Enron relating to $24 million owed. Please contact Renard Euell @ (720) 365-3033. @LynnJCook @RenardEuell
4051 2018-12-10 17:55:59 Seeing as we don’t have maple trees... or large bodies of water

We use what we got
Oil/lumber and agriculture 

We’d love to get into manufacturing however geography is unattractive 

And Ottawa has Quebec and Ontario as it’s pets..

So how would you diversify?
4052 2018-12-10 17:55:50 QC gets additional $1.4bn in transfer payments while balancing budget when AB is in crisis. Says no to Energy East, approves McInnis Cement plant that will increase emissions by 6% and is fine importing oil from the bastion of human rights SA. But yeah Confederation is all good.
4053 2018-12-10 17:55:44 From what I've read oil companies reluctant to build new refineries, margins very small and even smaller when you have to pay pipeline rates. Oil co. In the business of making money for shareholders not losing it. Much cheaper to import Oil or get it from east coast sources.
4054 2018-12-10 17:55:43 Wrong! Takes more energy to extract oil from sand!!! More emissions!
4055 2018-12-10 17:55:43 I’m releasing the coffee line in the next couple weeks. It’ll be a special link only a few people get to buy the CBD oil infused AND Sunday Morning before it hits stores. Also comes with hand written lyric sheets.
4056 2018-12-10 17:55:43 The high heating oil demand probably has a lot to do with the relative scarcity of natural gas.  (Mountains make gas distribution hard.)

Switzerland is installing ~20,000 heat pump systems per year.  That's not nothing, but still leaves a large way to go.  Probably eventually.
4057 2018-12-10 17:55:40 He has nothing to apologize for.
4058 2018-12-10 17:55:40 Yet you’d be on him for not importing oil from Saudi. Lol. You’re a joke!!!!
4059 2018-12-10 17:55:38 Oil and gas sector is spending a lot of money on telling kiwis why we should carry on burning up the planet.
4060 2018-12-10 17:55:36 We at the CBC are beginning to believe that the only way Canadian oil will get to international markets is when America invades is for it.

4080 2018-12-10 17:53:22 It's "climate friendly" because it's done in the nation's "green" and "progressive" leader, California, under the helm of Gov. #JerryBrown and our "stellar" Legislature. Their many "green" policies include #carbontrading, 21,000 new oil & gas drilling permits & the #DeltaTunnels.
4081 2018-12-10 17:53:20 I need to soak in coconut oil or something
4082 2018-12-10 17:53:10 Canola is an acronym (Canadian oil, low acid) because the trade group  for rapeseed farmers thought people wouldn't buy something called rapeseed and I badly want this to become Jordan Peterson's next cause, somehow.
4083 2018-12-10 17:53:01 The $14B is from your post. 
This is about 3% of QC's GDP.
Thanks to oil and gas, AB's GDP per capita is almost double of QC's.
I'm not saying QC can double its GDP but 3% more is certainly achievable.

4095 2018-12-10 17:52:27 Alberta is hardly an amazing economy, but a province which booms or busts entirely in virtue of the global price of oil: A sign of a region which has perpetually failed to diversify it's economy.

4101 2018-12-10 17:52:08 It’s sort of like you can show bravery for your country and also be a coward for not righting your wrongs. The two aren’t mutually exclusive. I wouldn’t expect someone who sounds so ignorant to understand that. Also, it’s Congresswoman-elect.

4115 2018-12-10 17:50:55 But fossil fuels are needed. You can't blame the oil industry for the demand. They are just supplying it. Otherwise we'd be in the Stone Age. Are you one of those who believe the oil industry is keeping known alternative methods from us?
4116 2018-12-10 17:50:51 I know about the oil but I have no idea why they needed it to last!

4131 2018-12-10 17:49:26 I think the opportunity for innovation in nonstick pans is dead. You’d think nobody ever heard of a nonstick pan the way some of the TV ads play incessantly. “We used NO butter or cooking oil and the eggs just slide right off!” (Applause)

4136 2018-12-10 17:49:10 I get tired of the right - left thing. I just wish we would do the right things. For example, I think it would be correct for eastern Canada to buy oil from Western Canada through a pipeline and to not get it from oil tankers from foreign governments. Just my opinion.

4142 2018-12-10 17:48:48 In partnership with Redmond Heritage Farm in Sugar House, our recycling of glass and mixed recyclables has resulted in eliminating the carbon emissions from 3.98 barrels of oil and the carbon emissions from 193.76 gallons of gasoline consumed!
4143 2018-12-10 17:48:47 Wait wait wait... Isn't that how Venezuela (the big scary 'socialist' country) the country Republicans always say is 'evil and terrible because of socialism', had it's economy collapse after their oil money dried up, Maduro though 'Print more money, it'll retain value'
4144 2018-12-10 17:48:45 This one that I am reading that 1.8% growth after recession isn't bad has me scratching my head sha. Consider we came out of recession more than 6 quarters ago, we've had significant rally in oil prices and seen inflation in low double digits. There is no excuse for 1.8% growth.
4145 2018-12-10 17:48:40 Possibly because of his interests in oil industry.
4146 2018-12-10 17:48:36 But oil revenue is.

4164 2018-12-10 17:46:43 @irvingoil any chance you wish to make less of an obscene profit and buy 100% Canadian oil?
4165 2018-12-10 17:46:42 Zinc and Vitamin C. Magnesium, either as Epsom salts in a bath or the citrate or glycinate forms orally. Vitamins A & D. Anything anti-inflammatory: turmeric/curcumin, ginger, ubiquinol, resveratrol, fish/krill oil, PQQ.
4166 2018-12-10 17:46:34 I usually go with deep fried stuff. Mostly because if hygiene is an issue, it would still be really difficult for any nasty bugs to survive the hot oil.
4167 2018-12-10 17:46:31 Who uses that much oil TF

Next please...
4173 2018-12-10 17:46:09 It’s very hard to find anything without vegetable oils or soybean oil. Maybe a post about good options for brands you prefer??
4174 2018-12-10 17:46:06 In the 1970s Ottawa had programs (NEP) to impact the price of AB oil, and the prov said mind your own biz.  Now AB wants Ottawa to put into place programs (trans prov. pipelines) to impact the price of AB oil.  Make up your mind, is the price of AB oil a national matter or not?

4181 2018-12-10 17:45:41 Stop buying oil from Saudi. It should be illegal to buy oil from there
4182 2018-12-10 17:45:38 RT SecretaryPerry: I also discussed the need for open, free, and fair markets with the Saudis.

4185 2018-12-10 17:45:20 *former bartender*
4186 2018-12-10 17:45:18 IMHO Fed/Treasury game plan is.
1 Keep interest rates as low as possible.
2 Keep oil prices as low as possible.
3 Use HFT as a tool for price controls.
4 Give member banks an unfair advantage using collusion & deep capture.
5 Strong USD policy.
Problem is all 5 may be wrong.
4187 2018-12-10 17:45:14 @JustinTrudeau bring Canada into the 2019 year you drive on the same side of the street as the united states bring up Canada to M.P.H YOU DO NOT USE HORES BUGGY ANY MORE !!and all your oil refinery were set up by united states billionairesin 1899 by Edwin Drake and John D Rockefe
4188 2018-12-10 17:45:11 Most Quebecers are OK with Canadian oil. Only our elites class are disconnected. Our Premiere was OK with oil and when he got elected he has changed his mind (stupid minding )
4189 2018-12-10 17:45:11 I’d take it , I got tinnitus too lol. I tried the CBD oil and I felt better like mood wise
4190 2018-12-10 17:45:10 I havent done any oil painting for years now 
That paint by numbers thingy was proven to be therapeutical in reducing stress 
4191 2018-12-10 17:45:09 RICK PERRY DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR OPEN, FREE, AND FAIR MARKETS WITH THE SAUDIS. THE SAUDI INCREASE IN OIL THIS YEAR TO OFFSET THE IRAN SANCTIONS SHOWS THE RESPONSIBILITY OUR COUNTRIES HAVE TO ENSURE ENERGY IS ABUNDANT, AFFORDABLE, AND AVAILABLE FOR WORLD MARKETS

4192 2018-12-10 17:45:06 To be honest,we want indy, Oil or Not.Scotland is heading for a Green Future. We're already producing over 100% of our electricty needs through wind. Tidal still to come.
4193 2018-12-10 17:45:05 Just imagine how great the world would be without all of the Arab nations... soon one day the oil will run out..
4194 2018-12-10 17:45:01 bro I am a amateur witch doctor . find you some Melaleuca essential oil ( doterra brand )... rub it on throat and sides of nose where your sinuses are . .
4195 2018-12-10 17:44:59 I have personal experience with both sexual assault and sexual harassment coming from the oil and construction industry so yes it absolutely happens
4196 2018-12-10 17:44:59 Just shoveled my entire driveway! Now I just need to learn to change oil and fuck myself and I will have zero reason to deal with men.
4197 2018-12-10 17:44:47 True. But was $11 billion borrowed for only power? We even had a situation where we had to borrow to fund the national budget. Is that not enough proof that the country with over $1 trillion USD in oil revenue alone since 1999 has been looted dry?

4206 2018-12-10 17:43:54 I don't blame them at all!! Too bad Mueller won't run for President. I'd definitely vote for him. We need to have a President that's not been bought by big oil, or any corporations, or Russia, or any other foreign countries.
4207 2018-12-10 17:43:53 Which has nothing to do with Alberta or it’s oil and it was investment in JD Irving not Irving oil that got grandpa Trudeau his millions, JD Irving is forestry

Also, i love Broccoli, cut florets in half, toss them in olive oil, sprinkle liberally with salt and bake at 400 for 20 some mins is my favourite. ;)
4209 2018-12-10 17:43:27 I’m against carbon taxes for the reasons you mention (because of factional identity, and because the details of taxes are necessarily unknown). But also because they do nothing to release the stranglehold oil companies have. Fight back by existentially threatening oil companies.

4212 2018-12-10 17:43:13 For the first time in 75 years, the U.S. is a net *exporter* of oil.

By decreasing our dependence on foreign oil, President Trump is making America “the dominant energy power in the world”!
4213 2018-12-10 17:43:12 drove around looking for gas and saw a bp and thought "screw that, they were responsible for that oil spill that one time" but I thought about it and decided that for $1.93 a gallon they can pollute as many oceans as they want
4214 2018-12-10 17:43:11 Good thing no argument for independence was based on oil then eh?
4215 2018-12-10 17:43:07 Dear Lord,
I am thankful for The Men of God you have blessed me with.
May Their Oil never run dry

4216 2018-12-10 17:43:04 Though Iran has deployed 58 ships in show of force but is it suicidal  enough of carrying out a self-destructive threat? Iran intending to halt  Gulf Oil trade in the #PersianGulf as a retaliation against US sanctions is a big risk to itself & jeopardizes its EU supporters.
4217 2018-12-10 17:42:50 Though Russia & Iran may be aligned in Syria whether Russia will support Iran in a naval war arising out of an oil blockade in the #PersianGulf is doubtful since Russia is presently coordinating its oil policy with OPEC.
4218 2018-12-10 17:42:37 My name is yunusa Sulaiman from Benue state am selling engine oil #tradermoni #smallloanbigimpact

4219 2018-12-10 17:42:37 Just like how the oil sands and farms are exempted from the Alberta carbon levy, in case you were unaware. ;)

4221 2018-12-10 17:42:31 2/2 I haven't tried CBD oil, but I smoke weed sometimes and that doesn’t work. I will try the CBD and let you know if it helps, and if you find anything that helps you out man please let me know this shit is fucking bad.
4222 2018-12-10 17:42:28 melaleuca oil . for real . 100% natural
4223 2018-12-10 17:42:20 Closing the #PersianGulf  could hit Arab nations oil trade & world market hard but would hit  Iran harder. Blockade of Gulf Oil will throw UK & European nations  together providing them & especially Israel with reason to attack  Iran & its nuclear facilities.
4224 2018-12-10 17:42:18 But what alternative? And why oil? Brazil lost more CO2 consuming trees to illegal logging again this year and the offset is worse the hydrocarbon production. A byproduct of solar panel production is one of the most potent (sulfur hexaflouride).
4225 2018-12-10 17:42:15 My Dad's car once started to leak oil in an enormous queue on the ferry. You can
imagine how thrilled everyone was!
4226 2018-12-10 17:42:14 You sure don’t do a very good job of standing up to Saudi Arabia on their human rights... you continue to pay them billions for oil, even though there is plenty right here in Canada, and you continue to sell them military gear that they use to abuse other humans #hipocracy
4227 2018-12-10 17:42:03 People scooping groundnut oil from the gutter are not among the extreme poor Nigerians. Extreme poor Nigerians don't even see that oil to scoop. We can't just blame everything on poverty when many people are just wicked and greedy hiding behind poverty.
4228 2018-12-10 17:42:00 How many miles do you drive? And conventional or synthetic oil 
4229 2018-12-10 17:41:50 Listen I know oil changes are necessary but can I get like... an all female staff? I didn’t really feel like getting hit on by randoms today.
4230 2018-12-10 17:41:47 Why don't they get on any other oil producing countries. Probably because they would be told where to go and how to get there. Canada needs to get a backbone and quit letting the screamers run the country our oil is the cleanest produced in the world.
4231 2018-12-10 17:41:41 When I wanted to move home in 2010 I was introduced to the MD of an indigenous oil company. Our “interview” scarred me so much so that I didn’t try to move home for another three years. It’s sad that we all have stories like this.
4232 2018-12-10 17:41:37 Once again the favoured province gets paid off by Ottawa courtesy of oil producing provinces.  What utter BS this is!

4237 2018-12-10 17:41:08 Which level of government laid off the oil workers?  Which level of government did not rehire all the oil workers laid off by not a government?

4262 2018-12-10 17:39:43 EM's weakness despite oil giving it a Black Friday sale has so much information wrapped into it - I am afraid it is being ignored by almost everyone
4263 2018-12-10 17:39:39 People often use the word "establishment" to describe both industry leaders and the politicians/thinktankers/etc captured by those industries. Especially since electeds in bed w/ oil, telecom etc are generally more influential in their parties
4264 2018-12-10 17:39:34 But the point is they live out of our pockets - taken £4.3Tn NPV in oil rev alone so they are desperate
4265 2018-12-10 17:39:23 It’s actually not Alberta proper that sends more than it receives. It is specifically the oil patch in Alberta that sends more than it receives. The oil patch subsidizes the rest of alberta as much as it subsidizes the rest of Canada.
4266 2018-12-10 17:39:09 Growth and comfort don’t go together. It’s like oil and water. You have to experience a certain amount of discomfort in order to experience true growth.

4277 2018-12-10 17:38:05 Coconut oil does too.
4278 2018-12-10 17:38:03 In line at Costco older lady asks “what do you use all the coconut oil for?” me: “mostly cannabis extraction, also usable anywhere butter is used. My kids love it on their toast!” The look on her face was absolutely priceless. 
4279 2018-12-10 17:37:59 A what!?!  I am not even from Alberta but have interviewed many many people who have lost their jobs and some family members over what is going on there. I am a journalist not an oil sands worker.

4285 2018-12-10 17:37:08 You now add this to OPEC+ reduction plus Canada shut in, Venezuela ongoing decline, Williston basin $30 oil (that will slow down that boom substantially, and you get oil prices falling still- oil price is about trading not fundamentals right now
4286 2018-12-10 17:37:07 I am disappointed about the oil market today. Even after the OPEC supply cuts the market isn't changing its path. Perhaps there are other global forces or computer algorithm trading we should be worried about #OOTT

@AskPHPeople @DirectPHC @sellitinPH
4291 2018-12-10 17:36:40 Oil prices eased, erasing some of the gains made last week when producer group OPEC and other key exporters agreed to cut their crude output from January to prevent oversupply.
4292 2018-12-10 17:36:40 Somebody buy me beard oil for Christmas
4293 2018-12-10 17:36:26 He need some canola oil
4294 2018-12-10 17:36:17 Fair reasonings; here's a few of mine:
EU balancing act has and will stall our growth, forever.
Manufacturing incentivised to move out of UK.
Fewer delays on trade deals due to not having to satisfy 28 countries.
Full ownership of our fishing and NS oil drilling.
4295 2018-12-10 17:36:11 That has nothing to do with TMX or the fact that QC & Canada imports foreign oil despite being the absolute worst regimes in the world (Saudi-Nigeria-Venezuela) while collecting 14B in equalization payments from citizens of AB while telling us it’s socially unacceptable....
4296 2018-12-10 17:36:08 If it takes 2 hours to do an oil change like last time

I’m going to riot
4297 2018-12-10 17:36:08 In the 1970s Ottawa tried to put into place programs (NEP) to impact the price of Alberta oil, and the province said mind your own business. And now Alberta wants Ottawa to put into place programs (trans prov. pipelines) to impact the price of Alberta oil.  Make up your mind.
4298 2018-12-10 17:35:58 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
4299 2018-12-10 17:35:56 Oh yay!! I learned how to do oil painting when I had my art class in the summer when I was like 9-10 yo. I’m gonna revisit my oil painting experience soon! 
4300 2018-12-10 17:35:48 Maybe : "The New World is a snake oil" 

I'm not really sure about this translation
4301 2018-12-10 17:35:43 Go get an oil change at Toyota.
4302 2018-12-10 17:35:38 U.S. Markets fell as ongoing trade tensions and falling oil prices extended the stock market’s latest declines
4303 2018-12-10 17:35:37 Got it. But I'd do away with it. It is a perverse incentive, and is not even calculated fairly. For example QC's huge hydro-electric revenue is not included in the formula.
QC could easily generate $14B just by exploiting its own oil and gas - it has both.

4306 2018-12-10 17:34:38 $XOP slowly starting to scale into XOP in the 30.20 area. Willing to take my beating if I'm wrong. The fall from 44 to 30 is just too much. Given the OPEC cut, sub 30 pretty much prices in recession type oil demand, I don't see it, not yet anyway. Scaling for a 28-30 average.
4307 2018-12-10 17:34:33 And portends bad things for Trump in 2020.  I been yelling Recession for some time based on Oil, Copper and Lumber.  Nows stocks as of this morning are in Correction.
4308 2018-12-10 17:34:21 I feel like every time I go to get an oil change, they try to sell me a whole new car with all of the things they “suggest I need done.”
4309 2018-12-10 17:34:08 Evidence for that final claim? You are really struggling here. You do know that the only income from oil is TAX take from profits. Now, tell us about profits in the oil industry. And costs to set against profits. And tax rates. But you can’t.
4310 2018-12-10 17:34:06 Why are cars so needy. 
“Change my oil.” 
“I need new tires.”
“My battery is dead.”
“I need gas in order to operate.” 

Smh do it yourself

4312 2018-12-10 17:33:56 recently visited Norway. sad it's financed by oil, but great roads, transportation, bridges, clean cities, lovely people.,..even (and this was a surprise) great eating., If I had to choose between living in AB (where I grew up) and Norway, bring on Babbel
4313 2018-12-10 17:33:55 KALOKA di ako aware na ang laki pala ng nakukuha ng oil companies from tax dollars i’m??? Not sure kung similar sa Canada.. Pero parang hndi kasi nakikinabang din ang ibang provinces sa equalization payments from Alberta lolzzz
4314 2018-12-10 17:33:45 Love this!
Dems have been slow-walking renewable energy (and its non-exportable jobs) for far too long.
No doubt because of oil and utilities money.
Sit-ins like this give old grey Dems the cover to say to their lobbying buddies, "Look, you saw it. It's a new day out there!"

4318 2018-12-10 17:33:19 I hate what the West has done to Persia. You used to be such a peaceful culture until the imperialists forced you to drill for oil & stole your resources. You’ll have an atomic bomb one day & vengeance will be yours inshallah.
4319 2018-12-10 17:33:15 @fordnation Canada waste million on Celsius and kilometers your a country bourding the united states and you drive on the same side of the street Edwin Drake and John D Rockefeller build your oil and gas using a charts and measurement Fahrenheit  Nia goat Penn,Nia goat Canada

4323 2018-12-10 17:32:51 I recently discovered how tasty pa amb tomaquet (or pan con tomate) is. Who knew adding olive oil and tomato juice/pulp to bread could be so darn tasty?! #breadwithtomatoes #spain #tapas #whoknew
4324 2018-12-10 17:32:49 We decarb to 99.9% too.  Just takes heat and time.  We also keep all the terpenes from fresh cannabis making an oil far superior in terpene content than anything made with dry cannabis.  Sounds like a marketing article to me...
...check out the TERP reactor from @WhistlerTechno1
4325 2018-12-10 17:32:46 Won't happen soon as oil and coal companies still dominate the whole market. Once oil and coal are gone, they will find a new way to charge us instead of using eco friendly energy resources. After all it's all about money isn't it?

4328 2018-12-10 17:32:27 I like the concept of edible oils, but in practice it's basically cutting beneficial medicine with a really harsh laxative. No thanks. 

And of course I'm not trying to smoke oil 
4329 2018-12-10 17:32:25 Listen sis... get that oil change and enjoy the rest of your day , you did the right thing in just minding your business and being civil, you deserve it queen.
4330 2018-12-10 17:32:09 This isn’t because of bad economy but greed of highest order,negating the medical issues that might come with scooping cooking oil frm gutter..someone proof to me this ppl u re seeing there re that poor..it’s sheer madness
4331 2018-12-10 17:31:55 That is one thing I don’t understand. Oil companies DO understand the problem and even see the advantage of a green environment to the country and to their bottom line. Is this simply revenge against Obama and his policies?
4332 2018-12-10 17:31:43 lol I didn't even know it had Palm Oil in it. Makes sense it does though I guess? Why is everything that tastes good wrong?
Or norty or bad for the planet?
It's not good because the only chocolates I like are ferrero rocher too!

4343 2018-12-10 17:30:39 Ban him from ever stepping foot on U.S. soil for starters. Impose strict and harsh sanctions on Saudi Arabia and call for his arrest (won't happen but it should be verbalized). Stop the sale of weapons and the purchase of oil. We don't buy that much from them now.
4344 2018-12-10 17:30:38 Canadian are too nice and will let him get away with it. Even though their economy is funded by oil.

4354 2018-12-10 17:29:45 Take Obama for example. He claimed to be a friend of the environment. Oil & gas production increased exponentially while he was in office. Same with pipelines. Allowed gas to be exported for first time in 40 years. He said the right things, while in reality things got much worse
4355 2018-12-10 17:29:44 Thank you Bibeth Orteza . Salamat sa ubod sarap na mga pagkaing prepped w love. Pakiki chika sa iyong malawak na relationship capital at ang dalawang highlight ng gabi-Cecil Lucas doing Chopin at my bottled tuyo in olive oil. Feel ko ang Pasko!

4363 2018-12-10 17:29:13 Did you know Canada is 1.6% of world GHG? Any real change needs usa India Russia China on board. Did you know pipelines are 1% of Canada's GHG in 2014? Did you know replacing foreign oil would reduce ghg emissions in Canada by 6 percent?
4364 2018-12-10 17:28:52 So we ran out of oil at like three AM. So it was 59 degrees in the house when we woke up, I broke out the heated blanket until it warmed back up. Now the cats won’t get off it

No heat including hair dryers for at minimum a month unless necessary. Find a deep conditioner & oil that's not to heavy for your hair. Trim the ends a bit.

There's a project of TransCaspian pipeline to Europe via Georgia whch USA sees an alternative to Russian supply network. Georgia invited to NATO bcs of strategic location.
4387 2018-12-10 17:26:48 Oil isn't everything but if it had run out, why doesn't Westminster just let us have what little is left. Come on, think about it engage that box of broken glass that is your brain and think about it. ( And don't mention that new oilfield that's just come online near Shetland.)
4388 2018-12-10 17:26:48 it should lower rates now to prevent a shock t higher oil prices. We've seen this mistake before....the U.S. system disintegrates in a situation of both rising, oddly enough, so does China.
4389 2018-12-10 17:26:47 So you support Saudi oil then? Good to know. You can't support the environment and support foreign oil. But nice try. Oh that's right you are NDP. Makes sense now.

4392 2018-12-10 17:26:37 Hi Vicki, 
Thank you for taking the time to contact us. None of our treats contain feathers or flaxseed oil. However most of them contain rice. The only treats we have that are free from all 3 are Dentastix. 
If you need anything else, please let us know.
4393 2018-12-10 17:26:31 I think smell/put them on you. I assume mostly placebo, which is just fine with me. We do use peppermint oil capsules here, which does have research proven benefit.
4394 2018-12-10 17:26:28 oregano oil dropped under the tongue as soon as you feel a cold or flu. A couple of times through out the day for a day or two and you will be good to go! Also, hot honey and lemon will speed up the process and make you feel better.

4399 2018-12-10 17:26:02 We make a mistake as physicians when we tell patients "they probably won't do any harm." They will. By tolerating quackery we legitimize it and enable its spread. Today there are more snake oil salesmen around than there were in my grandmother's time.

4402 2018-12-10 17:25:43 The US Military is more aware of urgent risks of climate change than the current US govt. Shipping industry is starting to generate solar and wind solutions. We have to keep spreading positive possibilities that are in existence to overcome oil industry.
4403 2018-12-10 17:25:40 Nigeria, Africa's largest producer of crude oil and the country with the world's 10th largest crude oil reserves, imports petroleum.
4404 2018-12-10 17:25:39 This uber driver complimented my beard, then called her french mom to ask her about an oil recipe that would keep it in a healthy condition. Little did she know we grow a beard for a living.

4415 2018-12-10 17:24:51 It’s very nice to shade some light on this fact so no one would came and say that the raise on energy prices are due to the raising of the crude oil prices.
4416 2018-12-10 17:24:51 I fear I'm the calendar person. I suck at picking good gifts. So much so that now I often gift homemade food (cakes, cookies, pesto, garlic/chili/rosemary oil etc) and it's usually very much appreciated (or so I'm told).

4425 2018-12-10 17:24:09 Naadik nako sa garlic and chili oil, or mga maanghang in general na yung tipong kahit mangiyak nako g parin
4426 2018-12-10 17:24:08 It's the sharing of wealth across the UK. Scotland paid in when oil revenues were high, we're just reaping the rewards now.

We should be trying to increase our GDP instead of the continual navel gazing over independence.
4427 2018-12-10 17:24:05 Bitch 160 FOR AN OIL CHANGE?!?!
4428 2018-12-10 17:24:04 In 1910, Gattefosse burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with Lavender Oil.
4429 2018-12-10 17:24:00 The best minds in climate science state clearly that we are running out of time. Decisions by oil companies to continue are not based on climate science, nor jobs, but profit from assets they wish to continue accessing.
4430 2018-12-10 17:23:56 The current WCS is still $25 less than WTI. Prior to US oil Independence it hovered around $10-$15. CDN light is $20/barrel less than its US equal..care to explain smart guy. Hey since I’ve got you..did the global supply/demand dynamic change by 8.7% due to the production cut?
4431 2018-12-10 17:23:41 Says the person who puts a train from a godforsaken oil country in a game filled with predominantly Western players.
4432 2018-12-10 17:23:39 LP cannabis oils are essentially snake oil. 
Just enough to get it into your system, but not enough to actually do anything. 
Reality, my urine is probably higher in THC and CBD than any current LP oil on the market. 

I'll bet money on that lol
4433 2018-12-10 17:23:29 Break the  law and grow your own.

Having 2 plants in continues grow/flowering cycles every 8 weeks  will produce enough thc oil for most patients needs. Using ecolights/L.E.Ds and a carbon filter will keep u safe

I know people who have to risk jail to medicate family members.
4434 2018-12-10 17:23:28 CBD oil is without THC and can help for many things.. if the CBD oil thus not work you could try THC in small dosage certainly as a beginner it is wise to call in professional help before trying.
4435 2018-12-10 17:23:28 I use castor oil on my eyebrows every night 
4436 2018-12-10 17:23:18 An economist PM had CUT capital expenditure on development projects and had FORCED Oil Companies to accept Oil Bonds! All those were for fiscal prudence. How many Heads of Oil COs did regist or resign, Mr. @mihirssharma , Senior Fellow ORF! Just asking!
4437 2018-12-10 17:23:10 そんな時こそ早く寝よう、うだうだ悩むだけ時間ムダだよ。忙しい時はそんな感じでいいんだよ。
4438 2018-12-10 17:23:06 The worst part about potheads switching over to vapor/oil pens is that I can’t smell it.
4439 2018-12-10 17:22:59 Your not getting it you are using yours and importing oil from the Saudis and Venezuela because the east does not have enough oil. We have it in Spades@for a lower price. Check with your Premiers outside of Que. they want Alberta-Sask oil.
4440 2018-12-10 17:22:59 GHG Emissions per produced bbl of oil are down 30% since 2000. But by all means, listen to Greenpeace 
4441 2018-12-10 17:22:44 Do you use palm oil? Thanks
4442 2018-12-10 17:22:43 The traitors in the govt bought the pipeline to ensure oil production is essentially stopped.
4443 2018-12-10 17:22:35 As long as all sales and installations are completed OUTSIDE the RHI, as this has proven to have increased the cost of a SHW system, which provides zero support for heating. Check out todays RHI supported SWH system only, and you will find its around £5,000, which the STA support
4444 2018-12-10 17:22:35 We need to shut down oil and swap to renewables
4445 2018-12-10 17:22:34 is it just my hair that reacts terribly to coconut oil
4446 2018-12-10 17:22:32 I feel like I’ve gotten an oil change every month since summer started lol
4447 2018-12-10 17:22:27 I suspect Mitch has been on the" take" from oil and other big industry for years. He must have hit paydirt this year because he is absolutely useless as a Congressman protecting the people of America.
4448 2018-12-10 17:22:25 จะหลับตาลงไปได้อย่างไร
4449 2018-12-10 17:22:25 Coconut oil does wonders leave it on over night then shampoo it out!
4450 2018-12-10 17:22:24 Using an oil to wash my face is feeling very weird.
4451 2018-12-10 17:22:18 @ABDanielleSmith The Indian Resource Councils mandate is to oversee IOGC. IOGC, Who is at the center of a class action by Indigenous nations for breach of fiduciary duty in regards to miss management of Oil and Gas assets.
4452 2018-12-10 17:22:13 oil can harry becomes a punk and starts a band called "The NGAAAAHmones". every album is just him screaming for 45 minutes
4453 2018-12-10 17:22:07 everyone thought electricity was so great.. until they refined oil.
4454 2018-12-10 17:21:58 IBD:  “LAST WEEK, THE U.S. EXPORTED MORE OIL THAN WE IMPORTED, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 70 YEARS” President Trump understood that energy independence doesn’t require wearing more sweaters but allowing companies to get at the vast supplies of good oil and gas right under U.S. soil.
4455 2018-12-10 17:21:55 It is no surprise as how are the oil countries going to continue to be rich if they agree to the climate agreement. This is sad to see. #ParisAgreement
4456 2018-12-10 17:21:50 Economists are offering lower revision options to the state income forecast, using lower oil prices to account for recent price drops. Edwards administration hopes that might persuade House Speaker Barras to agree to changes. #lalege #lagov

4460 2018-12-10 17:21:30 Does Qatar propose another way for Iran to export arms to Hamas? The pullout of Qatar from OPEC has one MAJOR Objective: Give Qatar & their Iranian masters the capabilities to sell UNTOLD Quantities of Iranian Oil through Qatar. Qatar is currently ruled from Ankara.
4461 2018-12-10 17:21:26 Hmmm the big oil producing countries.  Imagine that.  Except Canada but we already know they are the good guys.
4462 2018-12-10 17:21:21 Even my daughter in law who is addicted to the stuff has given it up now..    Does the Lidl version still have palm oil in it?
4463 2018-12-10 17:21:20 Too damn hyped in the morning it fucked up your equilibrium when pouring the oil
4464 2018-12-10 17:21:16 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
4465 2018-12-10 17:21:14 Aquaphor, Rose hip oil/balm and doing a sugar scrub before applying- lush sells mini scrubs you can carry around. You don’t always need the scrub, but it’s nice for when your lips have been in rough shape
4466 2018-12-10 17:21:01 Olive oil

Except that olive oil provides precious antioxidants (vitamin E and polyphenol), it has an extremely balanced fatty acid composition.
4467 2018-12-10 17:20:51 Try. Oil, soysauce and lemon pepper and garlic.
4468 2018-12-10 17:20:42 Any chance you can stop using Palm Oil in all your products next?
4469 2018-12-10 17:20:39 1. Slow passage of the Budget by NASS

2. Fluctuation in Oil prices.
4470 2018-12-10 17:20:26 Fries in hot oil
4471 2018-12-10 17:20:25 @HarvesterUK Really disappointed to see that your kickin’ garlic sauce contains palm oil? Really?! 
4472 2018-12-10 17:20:20 So you’re opposed to Trudeau bailing out the oil industry by paying $4.5 billion dollars for the Trans Mountain Pipeline? At least we can agree on that. No more welfare for Alberta, they have their trillion dollar Heritage Fund and can easily diversify.
4473 2018-12-10 17:20:18 I honestly should not be allowed to partake in Sunday funday no more! ... somehow I bartered a cocktail for some oils from the oil man last night... Sis..why?! 
4474 2018-12-10 17:20:12 Operating style equals snake oil salesman. Same was good ole Anthony
4475 2018-12-10 17:20:08 Its about the re starting of Powertech with a NEW forward thinking team, that just focused on selling hybrid systems, re-train past SWH MCS installers and market solar thermal that supports space heating. With enough money, a system kit would cost from £1,800 + profit to investor
4476 2018-12-10 17:20:07 Soon tear gas will be a weapon of mass destruction. Much like an atomic .
4477 2018-12-10 17:19:57 So what happens to the big oil companies?
4478 2018-12-10 17:19:47 untung ya km ga jerawatan mbak   oalah pake retinoid, blm berani aku pake itu hehe

ini kyknya aku mau coba face oil dulu aja deh, kalo ga cocok ntar balik ke cica 
4479 2018-12-10 17:19:42 The first amendment rocks
4480 2018-12-10 17:19:16 Apparently you seem to think by Canada shutting down it’s entire economy, all oil, gas, transportation, electric systems, manufacturing, or any other activity with any type of energy, that our 1.6% contribution to the worlds CO2 will make any difference??? Keep dreaming!!
4481 2018-12-10 17:19:14 Then you're talking about remodelling the entire capitalist economy because as it stands oil companies and the politicians beholden to their vast wealth will not allow renewables to become mainstream.

Btw what you propose would be demonised in the United States
4482 2018-12-10 17:19:13 Also a primary result of types of Qs asked. Mere political theater with zero significance except to 28% of Americans who gleefully accept lies from a snake oil salesman.
4483 2018-12-10 17:19:09 Get some beard oil and comb that thing out man.
4484 2018-12-10 17:19:07 Every time a butch lesbian cuts off her ponytail, an angel gets its oil changed.
4485 2018-12-10 17:19:01 A day will come when there will be more stars in the sky than the acne on your face  TRUST THE UNIVERSE, and the miracles of tea tree oil...
4486 2018-12-10 17:19:00 That was during the oil crisis; he was very fond of driving his '51 Cadillac :) Once nearly hit my dad with it as he was jaywalking. They started out with public education but have been moved to private schools, unfortunately. I don't give the monarchy much longer, to be honest.
4487 2018-12-10 17:18:58 I just tried to specify my car to the man at the Honda dealership service desk as “the Honda getting an oil change” and then proceeded to say “well this is Honda so they’re all Honda’s well anyways hahahaha” who let me leave the house today

4490 2018-12-10 17:18:45 We were in the axis when Obama's "all of the above" policy sanctioned the huge increase in domestic oil and gas extraction - some of which we're now exporting. Basically, this speeded up climate change. This issue is too important for partisan bull shit! #KeepItInTheGround
4491 2018-12-10 17:18:39 Nonsense. We can’t transport our own oil!!
4492 2018-12-10 17:18:35 So true..
British protected BP even after worst oil spill of century
America protected GM from Aggressive Auto industry
Even Chinese protected & promote own IT giants & didn't lose it to Whatsapp, FB, Google, Amazon or Samsung.

OTOH we despise our businessmen for silly reasons..
4493 2018-12-10 17:18:33 Time for a oil change
4494 2018-12-10 17:18:30 Worked 16hrs, spent 2hrs at the auto shop for an oil change, now I’m home wide awake  I should be in a coma
4495 2018-12-10 17:18:28 Péréquation comes from the whole Canadian gvt
Québec pays more taxes than Alberta
Québec subventions Alberta s
Indian payments
Police RCMP
Most gvt services ,done by fédéral gvt in Alberta
Tax breaks to oil industry
Pension fund
While paying for its own
So ,stick your pipeline..
4496 2018-12-10 17:18:13 The federal gov't does not import oil from SA.

Private companies do that.
4497 2018-12-10 17:18:12 What part did you miss of the fact THE IRVINGS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT OIL FROM KSA? They don't care whether there are pipelines or not, they are going to continue importing from KSA.

4499 2018-12-10 17:18:07 Great to hear from you Mr. Malley,care to comment on the Bellevue Wikipedia entry?  This bit. “group's growth was driven by funding derived largely from Tarek Obaid, the founder of the oil company PetroSaudi, which has been implicated in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal.”
4500 2018-12-10 17:17:59 By connecting the Otjikoto mine to the Nampower grid, plus the solar farm, only 9% of @B2GoldCorp's mine would come from heavy-fuel oil. #renewablesandmining

4504 2018-12-10 17:17:03 @Alberta and Sask could easily get in this band wagon .. instead if whining about oil.
4505 2018-12-10 17:16:39 Oil fail.
4506 2018-12-10 17:16:33 I’d prefer Canadian oil indeed. Saudi Arabia is an evil dictatorship, we shouldn’t be doing business with them.
4507 2018-12-10 17:16:30 @TeenTitansMovie very disappointed about the subliminal message about who said that “the love of money is the root of all evil”. In the episode “Two bumble bees and a wasp oil drum”. Just lost a fan.
4508 2018-12-10 17:16:29 Alright nice  

Still waiting on meh coconut oil ..I’ll definitely need it when I take out this weave

4512 2018-12-10 17:16:18 Done with my lil History rant on americas current food oil situation. Sugar also came about during the same time so they are related
4513 2018-12-10 17:16:16 I think the usual gop sheep will be appeased by the next new snake oil salesman proposing the next easy answer thing.
4514 2018-12-10 17:15:45 Bc Dems are the hypocrites. Republicans are at least honest they're working in the bag for oil and gas while Dems pretend they don't.
4515 2018-12-10 17:15:45 Like Crown Prince Bonesaw, as we continue to sell him arms to subjugate the people of Yemen & purchase Saudi oil to finance his brutal regime. 

Empty rhetoric, Champ. Your spinelessness puts blood on our hands.
4516 2018-12-10 17:15:39 Well, @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenCoryGardner, if you'll vote to end EV tax credits, will you also vote to end oil production tax credits? You know, because of your being "fiscal conservatives", and all that? American citizens want to know where you stand.
4517 2018-12-10 17:15:36 How did ppl even decide to use oil for cars and shit like they just drilled through the earth and were like yeah this black gooey stuff will do

Elites r cheery as robots r guards.
4525 2018-12-10 17:14:58 It appears Albertans pay  more federal tax because of overinflated public service and oil patch wages. Unfortunately you’re a simple coward That for whatever reason has failed to discuss what is needed in Alberta
4526 2018-12-10 17:14:50 SEB Bank 1/2: Market expectations for #NorgesBank has declined &only indicates a ~60% probability for a hike in Q12019. 
Fundamental case for a stronger #NOK in 2019 has become more robust considering sharp pick-up in oil sector activity &market’s cautious expectations for Norges
4527 2018-12-10 17:14:43 I am NEVER getting my oil change here again. They just hit me with some $160...I nicely just paid but hell if I’m coming back wtf
4528 2018-12-10 17:14:42 Who cares. He's as relevant as my last oil change.
4529 2018-12-10 17:14:36 The oil has run out. There's _very_ little profit out of the North sea.

What's to stop them reducing the higher levels of support that NI, Wales, the NE and NW of England get ( more per head than Scotland)?
4530 2018-12-10 17:14:35 got popped with bacon oil all on my face  shit still hurts lmao

4532 2018-12-10 17:14:33 I'm West Indian and I can't say what makes us more H.C. but my mother's husband is Nigerian and listennn, when that man cooks, the amount of oil he uses; the pots have to be scrubbed like 2/3 times to get rid of all the grease, also he eats portions that should be for 2/3 people.
4533 2018-12-10 17:14:32 First of all, go and listen to what the PM said, it was not a negative impact he said social impacts. Also “he” does not import any oil, and canada has been importing from SA for years, yes even during your former boss’s reign. Pls stop lying to Canadians. We are tired of this!
4534 2018-12-10 17:14:21 Because most dems in office acknowledge that climate change is a serious threat but vote for policies that largely continue the status quo. Many of them receive donations from oil and gas companies. Republicans don’t beat around the bush, they work for fossil fuel companies
4535 2018-12-10 17:14:19 I don't mind their meals. I just hate their love for oil
4536 2018-12-10 17:14:17 So you won't want our electricity, oil, gas, whisky, gin, quality meat fish and berries, etc etc? The countries of the EU certainly do so no problem.
4537 2018-12-10 17:14:15 OPEC's objective is raise prices and shale oil objective is to stabilize the oil market.
4538 2018-12-10 17:14:09 We sharpen and oil ours every night before we go to bed. Helps us sleep.
4539 2018-12-10 17:14:02 Not the Farwell cult. You can show them uncompromising vidoe & they will throw some oil on him and pronounce him SAVED. THAT'S THE UNVARNISHED TRUETH.

4542 2018-12-10 17:13:33 Economists urge caution, recommend state run a 25% reserve rate to guard against future volatility in oil and gas revenues and risk of recession in next 18 months.

4560 2018-12-10 17:11:57 We’ve got modest financial control over our finances. Here’s a question for you though: when the oil runs out, what’s to stop England getting rid of our higher public spending?
4561 2018-12-10 17:11:56 is like that idiot want me to pour him hot groundout oil,I don't even want to know how I will get it ..is it your father car that'll you'll  come and knock or open door, me and you we die there that day..nonsense 
4562 2018-12-10 17:11:53 لا يا اخت نهلة تختلف كلياً ..

4564 2018-12-10 17:11:42 This is absolutely horrific! I do believe some serious sanctions are due here. Time should consider making him the "Person Of The Year." Trump used his murder for lower oil prices and more arm sales to Saudi Arabia. Disgusting!
4565 2018-12-10 17:11:39 I was cooking then kiwi by Harry styles came on and I jumped and spilled hot oil everywhere. I burned my arm. Thanks harry
4566 2018-12-10 17:11:24 All the PNP try know say unu nuh off the hook enuh...Phillip Paulwell weh unu a hug up need to answer to some of the oil weh missing when he was minister!
4567 2018-12-10 17:11:23 Smaller more efficient cars don't kill the industry! Why the hell aren't we striving towards a place where NONE of our cars USE oil? I mean we CAN do it. Why aren't we? Well because they won't make as MUCH profit but business is still business and you fail to see that.
4568 2018-12-10 17:11:21 Baby oil, massage the scalp with it for 5 mins and brush it out!
4569 2018-12-10 17:11:17 you want organic oil if you can get it they put a lot of crap in ferts some labelled not for human consumption (or they were 15 yrs ago haha)
4570 2018-12-10 17:11:10 Right. Which is a wonderful benefit of the federation for certain Can citizens in certain jurisdictions. But how well is the federation working for AB lately? How can QC legitimately take oil money on the one hand and oppose resource projects on the other?
4571 2018-12-10 17:11:05 We use 22 barrels of oil per person a year, two million more immigrants are year means burning 44,000,000 more barrels of oil a year, start there !
4572 2018-12-10 17:11:03 No, rupee fell because of rising oil pruces and economic tensions revolving the big economies of USA and China. Investors and brokers don't look at the face of the governor and do business. Get educated, it's necessary to be an informed citizen.
4573 2018-12-10 17:11:02 Still in Afghanistan for some reason. Can't have anything to do with resources like oil, and defence contractors.
4574 2018-12-10 17:11:02 Capitalism did not create Climate change, that's a foolish notion. Climate change was happening way before Capitalism was ever thought of and man was ever on the planet. Capitalism is about the worth and happiness of the individual. That is the best option of freedom for all
4575 2018-12-10 17:10:53 Reminder that OPEC's objective was to stabilize the oil market, not necessarily to raise prices
4576 2018-12-10 17:10:41 Everytime I come for an oil change, I always end up paying for some whole other shit as well 
4577 2018-12-10 17:10:40 Residential cooling is rare.  Heating is essential.  Though modern insulation, heat pumps, and other tech helps, fossil fuels remain a majority for heating.  Heating oil is also unusually common relative to other European countries.
4578 2018-12-10 17:10:39 كلها مثل بعض
4579 2018-12-10 17:10:29 You realize Saudi Arabia nationalized their oil company, what has that done to fight climate change?

4584 2018-12-10 17:09:58 I thought not it’d be weird to put fish oil in wraps  thanks!
4585 2018-12-10 17:09:54 Nation-leading growth of 4.5% in 2017 doesn't look like "hurting" unless you take the narrow view of the oil sector as the only thing that matters... which is how Alberta got into trouble in the first place.
4586 2018-12-10 17:09:42 It's not the technology that's letting us down, it's the governments in bed with the fossil fuel industry ... global public money support for fossil fuels is still over $5tn a year....... and now we've got dark oil lords US, Russia & Saudi Arabia sabotaging our UN Climate talks.
4587 2018-12-10 17:09:37 Absolute lunacy, any faith I had in our government went today. Not that I voted them in anyway mind. SChoolkids could in fact do a better job, and the speaker doesn't need a foghorn so could go stand on oil tankers on foggy nights nd yell
4588 2018-12-10 17:09:29 AND the US is a net EXporter of oil for the first time in over 50 years!
4589 2018-12-10 17:09:21 put too much castor oil on my beard this morning and the smell making my head hurt

4592 2018-12-10 17:09:15 It is #awful to have Louis DeBrusk on those PbPs..and Cole was worse. All we EVER heard was how wonderful the Oil are. No mention of other teams (wasn’t this a NATIONAL Canadian game???). Get announcers who aren’t homers for national games. 

McJ this, McJ that blah blah. Blech.
4593 2018-12-10 17:09:08 On #HumanRightsDay, my wish is full access to CBD Oil for everyone!

4598 2018-12-10 17:08:49 @scientispharma and an oil that contains acidic forms of cannabinoids is far from placebo
4599 2018-12-10 17:08:43 Get beard oil and put a few drops on daily. It’ll really help with the itching

4601 2018-12-10 17:08:35 @elonmusk Saw you on 60 Min.  You want MORE Elec. Cars BUT where does "electricity" come from? Doesn't it come from Nuclear (no new plants being built), oil, natural gas, coal? Very few solar panels or wind turbines!
4602 2018-12-10 17:08:34 
4603 2018-12-10 17:08:34 This achievement despite a dip in d barrels of oil. The growth is across all d sectors. The railway  sector grew from 0.6% to about 4.6%. 

Let's make some noise on behalf of PMB/PYO......
4604 2018-12-10 17:07:48 Steam with peppermint oil, saffron, ginger, black pepper and clove tea & sleep. Thats the best medicine. If you can tolerate spice then have Hot & Sour Soup.
4605 2018-12-10 17:07:41 If only - We've got decades ahead listening to snake oil selling politicians promising that if we vote for them it will be different next time
4606 2018-12-10 17:07:40 There is absolutely NO data to suggest that though. In fact I'd like to see your source. Prove to me that increasing the price of oil reduces the amount of it that we use....and THEN prove that it's a viable way to END the use of fossil fuels. It's your claim. Back it up.
4607 2018-12-10 17:07:33 Bio oil 
4608 2018-12-10 17:07:30 What’s worse is that we’ll more than half of Christians have no idea what it says, they rely on the bloviating snake oil salesmen pastors to tell them.  

Man created gods just for this purpose.
4609 2018-12-10 17:07:28 Does a liberation have to have THE MOTHER ALL DEMOS? Can it be slow? Does it have to involve major politicians? Can it be ordinary citizens asking to have oil/gas/petrol prices increase wiped out?
4610 2018-12-10 17:07:22 Idk why some people want to stick with fossil fuel energy because of “job loss”. We’re not going to go to a no-energy system. Renewable energy creates so many new jobs and like no ones getting black lung or spilling oil everywhere
4611 2018-12-10 17:07:09 How dare you say horrible things about people who pretend that an oil containment boom is a legitimate breaththrough in ocean plastic removal!!!!   

Why didn't you reach out to them *again* if you're so smart and know a better way!?!?!

Dogfish > sandbar sharks!!!!
4612 2018-12-10 17:07:09 Question for the TL: Do y’all reuse the oil after you fry chicken?
4613 2018-12-10 17:07:09 Don’t be nasty to Paltrow. Peddling snake oil must be so tiring for her.
4614 2018-12-10 17:06:58 When Scottish independence comes, by all international conventions it's Scotland's oil.
The "Union" is the fig leaf used to cover the theft of that asset for as long as possible, just as the Empire was the fig leaf which covered the systemic rape of assets across Asia and Africa.
4615 2018-12-10 17:06:58 An old grandpa of mine told me that I should drink water as soon as I get up and then a spoon of olive oil. I drink also a glass of home made lemonade.
4616 2018-12-10 17:06:54 I'm only a few days in so the jury is still out but I'm p sure this glycolic acid toner and borage seed oil are going to take my skin to the Next Level. And she was already on a very elite level.
4617 2018-12-10 17:06:53 Oh look. A crybaby troll account *yawn*
If you have been sitting on your a$$ for 3 years waiting for that oil job to come back instead of taking advantage of the retraining programs offered, I don't feel sorry for you.
4618 2018-12-10 17:06:53 “They are in the midst of conducting a clinical trial funded by the company that is in part analyzing samples of cannabis oil given to them by pain patients”
Your trial involves analyzing existing oils??

4620 2018-12-10 17:06:44 Joining with best friends the Saudis and the Russians. "Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country" (McCain) and Saudi Arabia is bigger oil, Kuwait is only oil. Both Saudi & Russia have a similar way of dealing with the opposition. Now, who would you let carve the turkey?

4623 2018-12-10 17:06:29 I would be willing to do a study on that for 3 items off the  menu. That study would take me 3 minutes. I would be done before my food got cold.
4624 2018-12-10 17:06:28 Don’t give too much importance to UN. An highly ineffective body that has done nothing good. It doesn’t matter what the outcome of the resolution is. But a symbolic gesture might keep the oil prices down. Israel still remains a friend. Does Israel care about UN? No!
4625 2018-12-10 17:06:26 Iran is a major player in the world economic market as supplies oil and gas.
4626 2018-12-10 17:06:24 No politician who gets funded by oil companies or their employees can ever credibly pretend to be for significant climate action—remember that!
4627 2018-12-10 17:06:22 Antitrust time? Google / Alphabet is doing worst than Standard Oil, or Bell System ever could do. Really needs to be investigated. Not to mention Alphabet's involvement with China, and Whatever we don't know about. Guess they reversed the decision on "Do No EVIL"...

4630 2018-12-10 17:05:55 The 'expert' isn't even a pest controller this time. He's a 'property maintenance expert' and recommends these homemade snake oil (sorry essential oil) deterrents instead of plying for trade. Missed a trick there...
4631 2018-12-10 17:05:55 Do we actually have evidence that David Lee Roth lights a menorah? I feel that Adam Sandler just puts it out there and we accepted it because of the rhyme.
And if the answer is yes, than what kind of menorah? Does he use oil or candles?
4632 2018-12-10 17:05:53 Can u do a shor term chart on oil too please? Move to 55 from here?
4633 2018-12-10 17:05:51 Well Erin not that I am pr separation you seem to forget if Alberta has to sell their oil to the USA at a reduced rate, maybe it would be to their advantage to join the USA.

and refusing money from *individuals who work for oil companies* is not a thing you can do if you want to win in Texas, totally aside from the money.

4643 2018-12-10 17:04:34 Wow, only took three weeks to ration this one onto the twitter feed. How's that momentum going for you?
4644 2018-12-10 17:04:33 Revenue numbers indicate the absence of broad based economic growth, highlight growing dependence on oil and gas revenues as state has cut other taxes (GRT deductions and credits; income tax cuts; corporate tax cuts)

4646 2018-12-10 17:04:26 such as in early 2007 (physical destocking like today) and mid 2012 (demand concerns and Iranian waivers like today). In both cases, oil prices collapsed, volatility levels surged and the market rebounded sharply once these negative gamma effects played out.  Goldman  -

4649 2018-12-10 17:04:17 Trump sides with middle America against climate change Robin Hoods again — same as he has done by promoting US oil production. No surprise there.
4650 2018-12-10 17:04:04 Your cost of living comment makes no sense
Do you think places with no oil have no economies & no inflation?
The boom caused the rise but if it hadn't boomed we'd still exist
We existed & can continue to exist with less dependence on oil if we evolve for the future global economy
4651 2018-12-10 17:03:59 Add oil
4652 2018-12-10 17:03:59 When our economy is rooted in war and oil I can’t feel good about this.
4653 2018-12-10 17:03:55 Maybe buy a vaporizer or just eat the weed in gelcaps with olive oil or make cookies, etc with it. The smoke is very resin-y and not good for your lungs and bronchi.

4657 2018-12-10 17:03:39 At least we know when the president (some president someday) will stop coddling these terrorists: When the oil runs out.
4658 2018-12-10 17:03:39 You should really teach what you know, obviously.

But for the love of all that is good and holy

Don’t teach what you don’t know!!!

Please don’t be a part of the reason that people view online marketers as  oil salesmen.

Please don’t take a course and decide that…
4659 2018-12-10 17:03:38 The oil sell-off has instead first been momentum trading strategies and second, increased selling of crude oil futures by swap dealers as they manage the risk incurred. Similar sharp oil downward moves have historically all been associated with large "negative gamma" effects,
4660 2018-12-10 17:03:37 I drove around for almost 2 hours trying to find a spot for a oil change.  if I didn’t have to bring all that stuff back down I def would just fly
4661 2018-12-10 17:03:29 Gross Receipts tax increase driven by Eddy and Lea County, due to oil and gas production. Most other counties have seen a decline in GRT. Calling into question administration's claims that state economy is diversifying.
4662 2018-12-10 17:03:27 Is James 5:14 the most disobeyed verse in the Bible? “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.” Many churches don’t do this. Most Christians don’t obey this.

4679 2018-12-10 17:02:04 So you're saying the US is doing well producing their own?. Blame Saudi for the Canadian energy sector suffering?. So we should stop importing Saudi oil and produce our own?. Maybe ship more oil East instead of the east running off of Saudi oil?.

4681 2018-12-10 17:01:56 Quebec gets 13 billion of the 20 billion equalization payments. Alberta provides most of that. We will continue to use same amount of oil with or with out pipeline. Why not use Canadian oil instead of Saudia oil?

4694 2018-12-10 17:00:38 seeing everyone’s flats have christmas meals together is depressing bc last night at 1am i had to unclog a blocked sink full of food and utensils which was so gross to the point where there was a layer of oil forming on the top. none of the mess was mine. 0/10, hate my flat
4695 2018-12-10 17:00:38 I don’t trust him. He looks like a Kennedy.
4696 2018-12-10 17:00:35 Eww... Ghee in coffee? Please.

By veg oil you mean dalda? People still use that nonsense body-odour generating fattening miserable excuse for cooking oil?
4697 2018-12-10 17:00:34 What's the point of making an appointment for an oil change when it's been over an hour and my car is still sitting in the parking lot
4698 2018-12-10 17:00:32 Carter Page = Rosneft ($450B oil deal. 3% to Trump) 

Michael Cohen = Trump tower Moscow. 

Obama has sanctions on Russia meaning NOBODY could do business with them. 

Trump promised to lift the sanctions. 
Russia got him elected. 

There’s your conspiracy.

4707 2018-12-10 16:59:52 They’re trying to drill for oil in our National Parks 

Excuse me while l jump to a dimension where this does not happen

4709 2018-12-10 16:59:51 Shrug, eventually? I'm convinced. Meanwhile, my point is that if the problem is people needing to choose between eating or heating their houses, then we need to give them food, & subsidize insulation & electrification. Because in a warming world, we *have* to charge more for oil.

4716 2018-12-10 16:59:22 They believe that Japan was justified in attacking pearl harbor because the US cut off their oil supply. When I prove that the US did this after repeated warnings to Japan’s warring the Pacific, the Syrians reject this truth.

4720 2018-12-10 16:59:05 It sounds like snake oil, or rather, far too simplistic for this not to be common knowledge.
4721 2018-12-10 16:58:53 You are absolutely right. Hindus always vote for waivers, subsidies in oil etc.
Wake up Hindus. If not now we can't do anything in future. It's Hindus vs (secular Hindus, libtards, chrislamocommies, church, gulf).
For once stop worrying about oil, start voting for future!
4722 2018-12-10 16:58:53 the clans used to control the oilfields under Rebel control in 2013-2014,Assad claimed all the profits and the oil revenues went to the state's pocket before 2011,Nusra tried in 2014 to centralize control,but failed,ISIS maintained a centralized control over the oilfields
4723 2018-12-10 16:58:50 Lol can we move on from oil? It’s not 1910 anymore.
4724 2018-12-10 16:58:48 I'm sure you can get Saudi Arabia to embargo China's oil supply.
4725 2018-12-10 16:58:44 Fantasies that we can make oil, natural gas or coal "cleaner" or "greener" are just that--fantasies. It is not a long term viable option and we don't have time for it @cat_abreu #COP24 @CANRacCanada @envirodefence #ClimateChange #ClimateJustice #ActNOW @kairoscanada @PWRDF
4726 2018-12-10 16:58:42 Yeah. My asshole was soar then. Whereas today it’s bleeding oil!!!
4727 2018-12-10 16:58:41 Can I get in on this picture deal.... I want to see what a real man looks like. All parts of your body, people who oil up and flex i’ve heard are typically smaller in certain areas. I’d love to know if this was true.
4728 2018-12-10 16:58:39 Kayanya ada yang komen soal rambut trus dia bilang "rambut aku sebenernya kasar atau keras jadi dia pake baby oil biar rambutnya keliatan aga sedikit ada kesan "lepek" " maaf kalau salah bahasa korea ku belum terlalu lancar huhu :')))

4739 2018-12-10 16:57:51 Meds have been helpful for me, citalopram. Also CBD oil. Love the ideas of just going out to park or Starbucks where you can severely limit your interactions. But I'm guessing that is harder for an attractive female. :(

4743 2018-12-10 16:57:41 They'll tell you:

1. Oil is drilling a hole and watching energy come out.
2. Fueling a car with gasoline is more efficient than fueling a car with batteries.

It is what it is. No magic energy unicorn out there.

I'm glad I did, the stuff that came out looks extremely bad. I wonder how old this oil actually was?

4749 2018-12-10 16:57:12 90% of the tweets about “collusion” over a prospect have never been in business I’m pretty sure. In oil and gas we did RFQs & combustion business w Russian govt & companies every day.

4766 2018-12-10 16:55:40 The list of problems is fairly long (nothing described as Sezchuan was spicy, even after dousing half a bottle of their chili oil on the dishes) but it really is the price point of everything that makes it inexcusable.
4767 2018-12-10 16:55:38 As far as people are concerned, an official report has been published which points to missing oil (lots!) & wanton spending of public funds. They simply want to know who will pay. The govt will have to make an effort to explain, on the ground, why no one is going to jail yet.
4768 2018-12-10 16:55:23 Lebanon has no oil
4769 2018-12-10 16:55:21 And you are trying to bring emissions back up by allowing the expansion of dirty coal and more oil and gas. Fantastic.

4771 2018-12-10 16:55:09 Sure, but the government has the means to prevent importing oil from Saudi Arabia.
4772 2018-12-10 16:55:03 Big oil, finance and gaming have always adored him and still do - that’s why we have not seen the last of him.   Ryan will always be about 3 phone calls away from being the best funded GOP candidate in 2024, 2028, etc.
4773 2018-12-10 16:55:03 You can get the pen from anywhere you need the oil
4774 2018-12-10 16:54:53 I told my brother I was getting my blood taken today. He said, “It’s like an oil change. Replenish that oil.”
4775 2018-12-10 16:54:39 So I’m watching the documentary that was on the BBC about Prince Charles and I can’t believe he’s been advocating against single use plastics, pollution and also owns cars that run on electric and wasted wine. His train also runs on cooking oil.

4783 2018-12-10 16:54:11 It doesn't matter if we tax fuel or oil company profits. Either way, prices on gasoline will go up, which is desirable given the need to reduce consumption. The "progressive" position would be to support gas taxes and use the money to focus on alternatives to driving.
4784 2018-12-10 16:54:01 Ugh this sounds lovely!!! I would love to see you do this! 
Find an oil that works best on your skin. A finer glitter will spread better and mix easier in the oil. A runnier oil tends to drip down your body better. Research your glitters if you're sensitive to irritation. 
4785 2018-12-10 16:53:58 Lmao I just got my oil changed and when it was time to pay I handed dude a bag of pennies and said “u think this will cover it?” he said yes 
4786 2018-12-10 16:53:57 Cool, good info. Do you happen to have a source on oil PACs and where they donate their money?
4787 2018-12-10 16:53:48 So what are you going to  do about this ....besides sending out a Tweet about unfair equalisation payments to Quebec - which does nothing!  Shipping Alberta oil to the East coast is still a big 'NO GO'.  Why not tell Quebec NO more funds from Alberta unless Energy East is 'a go'!
4788 2018-12-10 16:53:40 Equalization payments need to be dropped and replaced with a royalty based on how much oil goes through the provinces pipelines. No oil flow, no money flow.

4792 2018-12-10 16:53:32 Maybe it is because oil producing nations do not want to be singled out to bear the cost and guilt for producing a product that you insist on using.
4793 2018-12-10 16:53:30 So I have a peer who only just started taking CBD oil. She now thinks she has cancer on her tongue, which she's paranoid was caused by the oil. Couldn't be the fact she smokes 3 pks a day tho.. 
4794 2018-12-10 16:53:28 The drop in Oil prices meant the case wasn't there to build pipes East AND West. Now we aren't doing either.

Elimate the Western pipeline and the eastern pipeline is economically valid again.

4802 2018-12-10 16:53:05 I feel the same way.  We have been providing exploration and development funds to oil companies forever.  They are acting like renewables can't compete without subsidies but the opposite is true.  They couldn't survive without taxpayer assistance
4803 2018-12-10 16:53:02 this palm oil situation has gotten a bit out of control. people boycotting companies unnecessarily when they actively support sustainable production of palm oil. the alternatives are much worse

4807 2018-12-10 16:52:47 The notoriety of the terrible duo, Modi-Jaitley have a lot to answer for. They played fucjs and drakes with financial policy. I am dismayed recollecting the FM 'gleefully' raising fuel surcharge 14 times, every time oil prices fell! Is this justified? No sir.
4808 2018-12-10 16:52:25 Federal Reserve/Treasury game plan is.
1 Keep interest rates as low as possible.
2 Keep oil prices as low as possible.
3 Use HFT as a tool for price control.
4 Give member banks an unfair advantage using collusion & deep capture.
5 Strong USD policy.
Problem is all 5 may be wrong

4816 2018-12-10 16:51:32 Googling about what affects testosterone levels in women is a nightmare: before you even consider how much of this stuff is flim-flam and snake oil, I have to consider that even if it's true, who knows how it relates to me, a trans woman with no gonads.
4817 2018-12-10 16:51:31 I can't imagine why anyone would believe a word that comes out of his mouth.  During the campaign he seemed like a glorified snake oil salesman,  but today it seems  he's more of an adept cult leader.  The gullibility factor in this country is scary.

4826 2018-12-10 16:50:38 5 quarts oil, 13 gals gasoline, 12 quarts ATF.
4827 2018-12-10 16:50:36 There is a problematic contradiction in Canada’s climate policy. We want to be seen as a global leader in climate change, yet we continue to invest in the oil and gas sector. To allow for growth from oil and gas, we will have to pursue unrealistic, expensive reductions elsewhere
4828 2018-12-10 16:50:35 So does this imply that if we removed all oil and gas subsidies that we wouldn't need EV subsidies?  I.e
 - natural costs would tip things in favor of EV's?
4829 2018-12-10 16:50:34 We get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia and 44% from Canada. Putting America First would mean not offending Trudeau at every opportunity. This man was a green card holder resident of the US, working for a US news organization, with an ex-wife and children in the US.
4830 2018-12-10 16:50:25 me: *wakes up from a dream that I went to prison for smoking oil* also me: *takes a hit as soon as I wake up*
4831 2018-12-10 16:50:22 I mean if the worst comes to the worst we'll start an oil war with the Middle East again so we'll be alright in the end
4832 2018-12-10 16:50:18 Gotta oil my hinge joints
4833 2018-12-10 16:50:16 Tensions between Deiri Clans and SDF over the control of the Oilfields of Al-Azbah,Al-Conico,Al-Jafra,this has developed into protest by Deiri Clans,asking SDF for a fair share from the oil revenues
4834 2018-12-10 16:50:15 Hooray  side note, maybe this will help some and we won’t be involved in as many wars, but our refusal to end our addiction to oil, gas, coal, petroleum needs to end today.
4835 2018-12-10 16:50:12 Jiffy lube oil clean up job we did. Call today 267-202-6470 no job too big or small.  Happy holidays everybody !
4836 2018-12-10 16:50:06 But Iran's yearly budget (March-March) is based on an oil price of $55
4837 2018-12-10 16:50:03 Baby girl is finally due for an oil change. Just hit 3k miles this weekend.
4838 2018-12-10 16:49:59 لو تم السماح لهم مثل ما تقولين!!
لأمتلأت الشوارع بهم!!
وراح تزيد وتكثر هذه الفعالية وتكبر وتصير برقص وعزف وغيرها
لكن الأفضل انها تمنع !!
اللي في مقطع الفيديو اذا كانوا بلا علم فوجب التنبيه 
لا تغالطي نفسك بيع الشاي على الجمر مختلف عن هذه!!
4839 2018-12-10 16:49:57 Nothing but empty slogans. Sell coal to China with no carbon tax, buy oil from a murderous regime like the Saudis, tax Canadians and do nothing effectively to fix the pipeline issue for the West and East. If only pipelines had a gender issue...
4840 2018-12-10 16:49:54 i forgot people fry things in pots of oil just because that seems like really unnecessary lol
4841 2018-12-10 16:49:53 Alberta pumps record amount of oil each day, 4 million barrels each and every day.

Where is that oil wealth?    Gone.     Stolen by foreign investors and foreign-owned oil companies.  

Bankrupt oil companies leave Canada billions in unfunded liabilities.
4842 2018-12-10 16:49:48 Try it out, it can't hurt. CBD oil is good for so many things, wouldn't be surprised if it helps with tinnitus. Helped me with a persistent shoulder inflammation.
4843 2018-12-10 16:49:04 When you're ready to get that oil change, come see us at 12961 Trinity Blvd.
4844 2018-12-10 16:49:04 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
4845 2018-12-10 16:48:57 Always happy to recommend books. You looking for stuff on Africa, corruption, oil? Or just good non-fiction?
4846 2018-12-10 16:48:51 Body cream for this season.

Baby oil + coconut oil.

I am not taking chances
4847 2018-12-10 16:48:48 The Worst IG and COAS Idris and Buratai yet they are in office as if we need 2/3rd majority of the Nass to remove them. If North can take oil from the south it even better at least let south have their own country simple..everything about North is problematic
4848 2018-12-10 16:48:48 One long term time cycle tomorrow is imp day. Need to watch price action tomorrow ... So much noise around. Any high/low made tomorrow holds importance. Letz see tomorrow. Keep an eye on Petrol, Oil & Gas and Shipping industry stocks from 1.30PM
4849 2018-12-10 16:48:40 One a day multivitamin and fish oil is where I would start
4850 2018-12-10 16:48:37 Its oil inside the pot. (Idk if you were being sarcastic)
4851 2018-12-10 16:48:31 Just finessed some mane choice growth oil for $4.97
4852 2018-12-10 16:48:25 1 NM is not very far in terms of an oil spill and being that remote and so close to Sable is the risk worth the reward?
4853 2018-12-10 16:48:01 Take a sip from a oil yellow it pull me down to a Lower level.
4854 2018-12-10 16:47:58 I got my girl using coconut oil now. Improving eachother even in the smallest of ways.
4855 2018-12-10 16:47:55 My friend is not on Twitter, he would be thrilled.
Andrew Garverick

Products are:
Pain balm
Gummies
Vape oil

Good luck everyone :)
4856 2018-12-10 16:47:39 E&P’s are trading like oil is at $30 but we’re still above $50/$60 $CRC $CRZO $CLR $DNR $PXD $OAS $RIG $WLL $XOP
4857 2018-12-10 16:47:39 I know. I said "USA needs oil" implying we are a net IMPORTER of oil from SAUDI ARABIA and that our relationship was thus based on our need to IMPORT OIL FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, which was like actually the case from 1947-2012ish. read carefully and then give a snarky replay  champ
4858 2018-12-10 16:47:35 Coconut oil.
4859 2018-12-10 16:47:34 If you still need that oil change, we can help!  Come see us at 12961 Trinity Blvd.
4860 2018-12-10 16:47:34 The frustration on the other side of this equation is that AB seems to want all the credit for making themselves the richest prov in the country, as though the feds never helped the oil and gas industry, & they complain about insufficient cooperation while still the richest.
4861 2018-12-10 16:47:34 Well my skin is now so dry that I can lather on coconut oil and it absorbs it and is dry again in about 5 minutes. #cantwaittolook60whenim30
4862 2018-12-10 16:47:26 Not putting a tax on unethical oil entering Canada.
4863 2018-12-10 16:47:25 OIL dey my head oh!!!! #Phyno 
4864 2018-12-10 16:47:20 No, but I’m heading in there right now...gonna oil up n do some flexing!
4865 2018-12-10 16:46:59 恵比寿は敷居が高いと思っていたのですが落ち着いた大人の街でやっぱり素敵でした～！
食べ物もおいしかったです
4866 2018-12-10 16:46:58 Climate change denying think tank funded by oil industry denounces universities using flawed methodology.

Amazing.
4867 2018-12-10 16:46:52 Just like how the market is plain wrong. I can’t wait till all greedy bears get caught offsides from there greed of Algos running markets.  13x s&p is just not warranted. 2/3 gdp is consumer. Lower oil. On top of all other reasons I stated are why we will fly higher imo. Enough
4868 2018-12-10 16:46:48 i need my nails done, inspection sticker, stuff for my hair, my gf’s oil for her car & then i need sum’n for dinner.
4869 2018-12-10 16:46:33 Do NOT oil that door!
4870 2018-12-10 16:46:28 I wasn’t referring to you? Neera Tanden was so mad that people were criticizing O’Rourke for taking a ton of oil money that she literally called it a Bernie conspiracy, yet people are more mad at DSA for pointing out the austerity stuff
4871 2018-12-10 16:46:24 I should say that I have not received response from anyone in Sweden who has seen a wrapper saying "certified palm oil" or something to that effect on a wrapper.
4872 2018-12-10 16:46:24 krn moisturizer udah mau abis jd kepikiran buat ganti pake face oil aja but im afraid it might be too rich 
4873 2018-12-10 16:46:20 I love my cast iron pan where I had to bake the oil in.  There are so many pans to choose from! I ended up getting a non-stick since it was cheaper.
4874 2018-12-10 16:46:07 Lmaoooooooo of course I need an oil change now out of all times
4875 2018-12-10 16:46:00 During world war 2 the animal fats were being used to make bombs, so our govenment paid some scientists to figure out what to do with all the junk oils we couldnt use for war and electricity made oil lamps obsolete... Crisco was born, a hydrolated cotton seed oil #history
4876 2018-12-10 16:45:46 Combine 2 quarts Squid  with 3 pints daikon. Add Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with salmon
4877 2018-12-10 16:45:42 It’s worse. He knows Irving Oil buys the oil from Saudi Arabia, not the government, but he also knows a large segment will swallow his lies, so he continues to lie.
4878 2018-12-10 16:45:42 Because no one called him on his bull shit for 45 years isn't an accomplishment. Its an indictment on the N.Y. media. The guy is a propped up snake oil salesmen who's only claim to fame after bankruptcy after bankruptcy is he got bailed out by Russia & is their "puppet stooge"!
4879 2018-12-10 16:45:33 ความวันช็อตติดชาร์ต 15 เดือนค่ะคุณ ต้องยอม ฮืออออ
4880 2018-12-10 16:45:32 I need to start back my collection. I only have the Shea moistures black castor oil cream
4881 2018-12-10 16:45:24 Also "new moves" ... Is it oil capcom? Please make it oil
4882 2018-12-10 16:45:20 oil paints are annoying i don't like them >:(
4883 2018-12-10 16:45:19 Pesto… crammed with basil leaves, with some olive oil, parmesan, and seeds. (I've found sunflower seeds are a very affordable substitute for pine nuts.)
4884 2018-12-10 16:44:56 فيه ساحات في اوروبا وشوارع وعند المترو يوقفون مثل العازفين او الرسامين المهم اللي ماعندهم وظايف وضروفهم صعبه منها اسعاد للناس ومنها مصدر دخل لهم... وانا اشوفها فكرة سديدة بدال السدحة في البيت وامه ولا زوجته تصرف عليه. نفس اللي يبيع شاهي على الفحم.
4885 2018-12-10 16:44:55 I want to scrub the floor BUT not sure anyone else will after I do it. I should tho. Scrubbed one area where I spilled oil and it looks weird lol
4886 2018-12-10 16:44:52 @POTUS @petenajarian explain to viewers this is all algo driven. No recession. No systemic risk. Low oil. Earnings revisions not goin down. It’s the uptick and millennial ignorance imo. Markets are so cheap wrongly that a huge bounce will take all wrong bears offsides.
4887 2018-12-10 16:44:47 Saying no to the snake oil salesman doesn’t mean you don’t believe in medicine.
4888 2018-12-10 16:44:40 Disgusting as it may sound, cognitive behavioral therapy links people scooping groundnut oil from a gutter for reuse to extreme poverty.
4889 2018-12-10 16:44:28 More importantly those in the prairie provinces all think alike.  Farmers, oil men, miners etc. are all entrepreneurs / self-reliant.  We could become the Switzerland of North America.
4890 2018-12-10 16:44:27 Seems stupid to sue them, why not sue all the people that used the oil?
4891 2018-12-10 16:44:16 Oil change got Bully running so much better
4892 2018-12-10 16:44:14 Ночной просмотр отменяется. Вай фай снова отрубили, падлы.
4893 2018-12-10 16:44:07 I use jergens oil infused Shea Butter. To be fair, I use it over regular lotion. #face #knee #elbow
4894 2018-12-10 16:44:00 Why? We don’t buy oil from China. Lol. Dumb argument but par for the course from Drew. #ableg #medhat
4895 2018-12-10 16:43:50 #Democrats, stop spreading the oil,coal and gas #ExtinctionEmissionsPlague. BACK LIFE! Back a healing solar and wind #GreenNewDeal instead.
4896 2018-12-10 16:43:43 Hey so who’s used our Midnight Oil collection already!?
I’m waiting for mine and I’d LOVE to see some results & testimonies on it, as I’ve heard it’s AMAZING!!
4897 2018-12-10 16:43:41 Think it depends on the type of oil and only oil cuts oil so maybe the hydrating products also have oil? So it creates space for the moisture
4898 2018-12-10 16:43:31 Wherever I walk
the roads are oil slicked
thus I must slide
with the last light,
never caring too much
about my charcoal feet,

eyes on tomorrow's fine horizon
a slim chance of sun
maybe ivory flowers,
I ask too much, but I blame the wine
& thoughts of you after hours.

4901 2018-12-10 16:43:13 Oil dey my head
4902 2018-12-10 16:43:09 The oil market is collapsing into recession along with broader economy. Western ND will need those funds to survive. The last thing we need is overpaid professors and foreign grad students conducting research to tell us how it all happened & how they can fix it. #1984 #busted
4903 2018-12-10 16:43:06 Smocking? Is that what the other art majors were doing when they left class for 15 minutes at a time? I wish I knew they had been SMOCKING, could have saved my clothes from a lot of oil paint stains
4904 2018-12-10 16:43:04 I dont want either, just to be clear

So by extention of your argument, youre okay will killing brown kids for geopolitical gains and oil, so long as the person control the military (which burns more oil that the bottom 135 countries daily) believes in climate change?

#Paradox
4905 2018-12-10 16:42:52 Hahahaha, I only do that as a joke -- I know about as much about programming as I do automotive maintenance.  For example, I poured oil on my computer just last night!
4906 2018-12-10 16:42:40 The hypocrisy is incredible. We don't want your oil but please take our electricity. And never mind the raw sewage dumped in waterways. Oh and keep the money flowing.
4907 2018-12-10 16:42:33 จะรอนะค้าบบบบบ
4908 2018-12-10 16:42:32 Nobody is gna get charged for the petrojam scandal.. and they’re talking abt putting it up for sale now because all of a sudden there is no need for a government to own an oil refinery..
4909 2018-12-10 16:42:31 It may be time to dump Saudi Arabia. American oil production is soaring. We no longer need those 8th century barbarians.
4910 2018-12-10 16:42:28 おやこれは、、覚えておく！！
4911 2018-12-10 16:42:25 閻圃、軻比能の完殺コンビが気になるのだが、どうなんだぁ！
4912 2018-12-10 16:42:24 Yogurt, Avocado , Olive Oil & Pink salt all in blender,,, best dip for keto diet meals 
4913 2018-12-10 16:42:22 Also look to how they use the cheapest oil in 20 years to refine their fuel and other petroleum products and George Canadians among the highest gasoline prices ever.
4914 2018-12-10 16:42:19 It should be noted, however, that the Wahington state initiative failed because Big Oil spent millions on an advertising barrage that was misleading & downright false in many cases
4915 2018-12-10 16:41:55 Mexico can still pay for the wall. Tax all wire transfers originating from the US and going to Mexico at 15-20%. Wire transfers are Mexico's largest source of income now, even surpassing oil revenues. The problem is, Trump would have to EO it, and a liberal judge would block it.
4916 2018-12-10 16:41:54 I am so awkward when I go to shops to get my oil changed 
4917 2018-12-10 16:41:54 It’s monkey gland oil!!
4918 2018-12-10 16:41:51 Strong and stable, let's be honest the Tories will sell you any old snake oil
4919 2018-12-10 16:41:41 ヘッダー肌色多いな
4920 2018-12-10 16:41:38 THAT LAWNMOWER IS SMOCKING! NEEDS SOME GOOD SAUDI OIL IN IT!
4921 2018-12-10 16:41:34 he's been selling snake oil since day one while doing the bidding for the 1%  Progressives are just too stupid to realize it.
4922 2018-12-10 16:41:30 Ameen tnx
4923 2018-12-10 16:41:27 Garlic is usually the base. Fresh garlic is a vegetable. I also like garlic powder for the toastiness. Salt or a salty condiment, like fish sauce or soy sauce. Pepper-ginger-lime-coconut. Garlic-ginger-toasted-sesame-oil. Garlic, S&P, smoked paprika. Cumin & coriander. ONION
4924 2018-12-10 16:41:05 メモメモφ(..)
4925 2018-12-10 16:41:01 I don't really care if it costs more to use extract and refine AB oil. We should use it instead of importing, then raise the price of gas to compensate, and that will encourage a shift to electric. =)
4926 2018-12-10 16:40:56 As someone who loves glitter, might I suggest; for glitter oil shows, make a drop cloth. Old towels or even a sheet. Mix glitter with a carrier oil like coconut or baby oil. Use gentle dish soap to wash it off in the shower, and tape/roller to get off what's left on your skin. 
4927 2018-12-10 16:40:46 He really isn't as successful at his businesses as you think he is. All he's good at is marketing his own name, he's nothing but a successful conman that you've clearly bought the snake oil from.
4928 2018-12-10 16:40:45 Politicians give subsidies to oil bc industry spends exorbitant $$ on lobbying.. If they were thinking about wellbeing they would get behind emerging renewable tech. New jobs/energy without the health and environmental disasters that come with fossil fuels.
4929 2018-12-10 16:40:35 For me the most important thing was feeling like exploited by salespeople at ICE dealerships. Time waste during purchase and also for oil change and all the other regular tuneups. With Tesla’s à la carte purchase options is the best- choose what you want and be happy with it 
4930 2018-12-10 16:40:26 olive oil 
4931 2018-12-10 16:40:23 Forgot to mention that it's made with natural ingredients like beeswax, wheat germ, and melaleuca oil
4932 2018-12-10 16:40:10 Worst. oil. ever.
4933 2018-12-10 16:40:05 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
4934 2018-12-10 16:39:56 Depends but my go-to is a lil olive oil, salt, pepper, a lil onion and garlic powder, cumin, and oregano. Occasionally sprinkle some lime during grilling.
4935 2018-12-10 16:39:54 Cita cita terbaru aku sekarang mo beli young living oil yang starter pack 
4936 2018-12-10 16:39:53 Wheatley is unaware how $5 bil of oil could disappear-he didn't know. Also, didn't know the party was expensive. He doesn't have US $1,000 but, he will repay. How? By going to friends.Friends like these I want to repay SLB. How comes #jps a bare bruck pocket friends me have?
4937 2018-12-10 16:39:51 You are history maker,we love you. India is bigger than persons. With common sense, computer we can manage RBI without stress if loans are repaid, bank staff are honest, people like truth, honesty, nation. No bank will fail.more exports, no oil imports
4938 2018-12-10 16:39:48 US wasn’t an oil exporter then sport
4939 2018-12-10 16:39:40 Time to oil up the pool boy again
4940 2018-12-10 16:39:34 Seems that's all #Angs peeps can talk about.

Big difference between #UKOG #Horshill and #Brickham is HH flows lots of oil. Brockham may well be a duster. We just don't know until they test it...when ever that maybe. 

Very risky at the mo imho.
4941 2018-12-10 16:39:26 @realDonaldTrump First time in 75 years the USA is no longer reliant on foreign oil.
WOW!  I never thought it would happen in my life time.  Thank you POTUS!!!
Most excellent job!
4942 2018-12-10 16:39:25 As Rebecca Solnit put it: Axis of Oil.
4943 2018-12-10 16:39:17 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
4944 2018-12-10 16:39:14 Were never actually slated to do so. They never were intended to stop Saudi oil being purchased in Canada the first place.
4945 2018-12-10 16:39:14 おやすみなさいませー
4946 2018-12-10 16:38:58 Honey for a sore throat. Diffusing thieves oil for congestion. That's what worked for me
4947 2018-12-10 16:38:57 Ice coconut oil aloe vera repeat
4948 2018-12-10 16:38:52 Yeah, Mégantic doesn’t super support your point: Irving acted irresponsibly & was ordered to pay $4M in damages related to Mégantic. Oil companies regularly shirk their responsibilities & counting on them to clean up is a bit like counting Trump to do the right thing.
4949 2018-12-10 16:38:47 Spot on because of oil, my family and I always voted you even in the last election, i must stress they keep mentioning Tommy that makes them think Ukip is becoming a BNP, but i do say well he did expose the hidden crimes etc... unlike the others, that's what concerns alot ofnt
4950 2018-12-10 16:38:46 Maybe the Que premier still remembers when the west once told easterners that they could freeze their ass off, since they had all the oil.
4951 2018-12-10 16:38:45 Put it on my temples?? I just ordered a cbd oil I heard it’s good for migraines
4952 2018-12-10 16:38:43 We can take care of that oil change.  Come see us.  687 W Campbell Rd
4953 2018-12-10 16:38:41 One word: OIL

Context: Bigly money.
4954 2018-12-10 16:38:30 I.e, you need more oil to replace oil. If the oil is expensive, shift to renewables will be expensive. But cheap oil is bad for the environment, which means we will have to shift to renewable energy with expensive oil, meaning shift to renewables will be expensive. 2/2
4955 2018-12-10 16:38:26 $85 for a oil change .. shoot me now.
4956 2018-12-10 16:38:23 Tee tree oil from walgreens, spray it on over night it will go away in a couple days
4957 2018-12-10 16:38:22 Remember washing of feet with oil from alabaster box as well 
4958 2018-12-10 16:38:10 Lol this Niger ppl r hilarious
4959 2018-12-10 16:38:06 If I was a different person, then maybe I would gravitate towards different article choices for the thing I read while eating "breakfast" as I just got up.

You know, something fluffier like believe that smelly oil will save you or some bullshit about "self care."
4960 2018-12-10 16:38:02 @AudiOfficial I have troubles with my Audi Q5. Today is consuming 1 oil liter per week. I know this problem and in many times is listed as a common problem in models between 2009 to 2011, and give warranty in some countries.  I repaired also the transmission and cost a lot.

4962 2018-12-10 16:37:48 UP a combined 28% on my shorts on $SPY, $OIL and $TLRY (including fees)
4963 2018-12-10 16:37:44 A hypocrite? I mean, schemer takings funding from people who import that oil. Government policy does influence things but the actual economic case wasn’t there for those pipelines going east to actually sell Alberta oil to sell in a eastern Canadian market. Partly why those pipes
4964 2018-12-10 16:37:44 Swear to god Trump would choose oil profits over the survival of humanity
4965 2018-12-10 16:37:42 Or that we would save money.

4971 2018-12-10 16:37:32 This has been going on a while. More than once an LP sent me placebo oil.  I make my own oil now because of it. So much cheaper. So much more potent. Need so much less per dose.

ONE in FIVE trains late

Salmond up in court

That's the tip of the iceberg.
4974 2018-12-10 16:36:45 I want to know the costs. 
If it is cheaper to extract oil from Alberta, then either 
our ministers are complete idiots and don't know wtf they are doing
They have special contracts with SA
Or they are pandering to certain groups.
I want to know which it is.
4975 2018-12-10 16:36:40 Marijuana oil perhaps? They have non THC stuff now that won't get you high but helps with pain and sleep.
4976 2018-12-10 16:36:38 Perhaps it has something to do with the fact they r depleting fisheries in the St. Lawrence river & great lakes. They are expert swimmers & more importantly they are even better hunters. Once on the endangered species list, now flourishing. Spraying oil on their eggs not working.

4982 2018-12-10 16:36:10 The energy comes in form of oil because the whole 20th century economy was built because of prevalence of cheap oil with high EROEI. To replace the fossil fuel infrastructure on which the world is built requires massive energy expenditure that cannot be provided by renewables 1/2
4983 2018-12-10 16:36:06 hahahaha what a joke! In this decade historical monuments have been torn down, national parks were off limit to the public (temporarily), and big oil companies were given the geeen light to go onto Indian land and pollute their water. So who is LWCF really protecting??

4987 2018-12-10 16:35:32 Perhaps have a quiet word in Mr. Irving's ear then. Because I know (and so do you) that Mr. Trudeau doesn't import oil - refining companies do. Why the constant lying to Canadians?
4988 2018-12-10 16:35:05 I just smelt dundun now and i remembered gutter oil .
4989 2018-12-10 16:35:04 The vape pen works for me right away, couple of puffs and I feel relief. Ingestion takes a while, but I ingest the oil before bed to sleep better. It is better than pills with nasty side affects!
4990 2018-12-10 16:34:58 for the first time in 75 YEARS the U.S. exported more oil than it imported, that means that we just passed Russia AND Saudi Arabia in oil production. you can say what you want about Trump, but in the last 7 decades, no other president did that.

4993 2018-12-10 16:34:47 I had the same thought on the commute back from work..if he could be a non-exec in an oil major he could be @RBI Gov. Its worth trying a dose of loud and foul-mouthed abuse to coerce the #Rupee up, #inflation down, #CAD positive, #NPAs to vanish, #BlackMoney to white
4994 2018-12-10 16:34:47 This madness needs to stop. QC has enough population and industry to easily sustain a third of Canada, yet it's the other way around. They import oil, but take our oil earnings. It should be a per capita system. Bombardier gets bailed out and we get a pipeline held up in court...

4998 2018-12-10 16:34:37 Now that the US produces its own oil everything is set in place to drop the petrodollar. Get out of the system! Stop saving in debt and beware of the true value of its derrivatives.

5001 2018-12-10 16:34:29 Maybe if the west was less reliant on oil the Saudis wud lose their influence
5002 2018-12-10 16:34:20 @francoislegault   meanwhile Saudi Arabia, no friend to the environment, no friend to human rights, keeps sending oil to eastern Canada. and Canada loses billions in revenue. sad state of affairs.

5025 2018-12-10 16:32:29 Because it's just a cynical argument of convenience.

Saudi Arabia has been a major human rights issue for ages.
But till now it was for the Saudis to deal with.
From spreading Islamic fundamentalism to jailing women rights activists, access to their cheap oil was more important.

5030 2018-12-10 16:31:56 I think what rankles many of us in Alberta is not that Quebec receives equalization but that #equalization is an example of Canadians helping each other and we'd like to see more support for Canadian oil because that would be an example of Canadians helping each other.

5047 2018-12-10 16:30:19 You asked about a replacement, i showed you both the replacement & the structure.  If both Russian & Saudi oil rsvs are close to running out, my advice is that gold/farm/timber are the ONLY things you want to own, b/c all paper assets are based on a steady supply of cheap oil
5048 2018-12-10 16:30:15 If you are so opposed to oil, have you eliminated all air travel, all travelling holidays, gotten rid of all pets, and eliminated all imported food, as a start?  All are nonessential and all use a significant amount of oil
5049 2018-12-10 16:30:07 Yes, but Norway also doesn’t handcuff its industry, and instead exports huge amounts of oil, using the profits to fund their social benefits. You know, like a rational country with insane amounts of potential resource wealth would do. Ours is unfortunately run by spineless idiots
5050 2018-12-10 16:30:05 So I’ve been out here paying and you know how to change oil!!!  teach meeeeeee
5051 2018-12-10 16:29:58 But there is no sustainably-grown palm oil currently in the market. And what constitutes sustainable? With bananas, no industrial grower could do it, only small growers in co-ops. But there was no way to meet modern requirements. Same with palm oil. Where are the small growers?

5. Kompres pake es batu
5055 2018-12-10 16:29:32 I think he was trying to make a point: we need a gender-based analysis of a pipeline but we are ok importing oil from a country that has a very poor record on women's rights, gay rights, and human rights.
5056 2018-12-10 16:29:30 Putin also hosted an excellent World Cup, and brought oil prices down. He’s done more for America than anyone else on that list.

5059 2018-12-10 16:29:20 Exactly! That’s why I prefer to have more background stuff - like try to avoid palm oil - here are some ideas...  and I think I got annoyed at the sew your own clothes thing - without a real other option

5066 2018-12-10 16:28:40 @AndrewScheer think Trudeau is the first to import Saudi oil, history says these imports increased 10 fold under conservative leadership.

You only used this argument to stir your base sir, shame on you - this is why you'll never be PM Andy, you are Trump in a smaller costume.

5070 2018-12-10 16:28:07 Are you concerned about clean up of Saudi oil fields, or is it ok to get your oil from there because those environmental concerns and human rights abuses are out of sight out of mind

5075 2018-12-10 16:28:00 Oil companies always clean up oil spills,how many Quebecers died with transporting oil by rail? How many people have ever died transporting oil by pipeline?

5077 2018-12-10 16:27:42 yes, agreed. One argument against solar and other renewables is that they are "artificially" cheap because of subsidies. the only reason oil is "cheap" is bc of those same subsidies and oil companies shifting cost of doing business on society. oil is artificially cheap.
5078 2018-12-10 16:27:40 Lower oil prices have fallen more than 30% from multi year highs, already ripping through the economy
5079 2018-12-10 16:27:37 You have no idea of status of Russian or Saudi oil reserves. Making assumptions on zero info is a bit silly.  Besides, who’s to say a new asset won’t overtake gold? Then what?

5089 2018-12-10 16:27:03 Agree,the GOP have planned this entire thing.Trump was used to get certain bills passed,only they could have orchestrated this charade.I believe this all has to do with Oil.

5095 2018-12-10 16:26:30 Shame on NBC for reporting this drivel.  There is no “quick fix”.  We must stop the profligate consumption of oil.  It is an exceptionally inconvenient truth.
5096 2018-12-10 16:26:24 "Even the Alberta Chamber of Resources, an industry lobby group, admits that the term “oil sands” gained popularity in the mid-1990s, when government and industry began an aggressive public relations campaign to improve public perception of the dirty-sounding “tar sands.”
5097 2018-12-10 16:26:18 It’s simple  hypocrisy. If Quebec can stop the construction of a Canadian, then we should be able to stop the transfer of funds generated by western Canadian oil.
5098 2018-12-10 16:26:17 girl all you need is some baby oil gel
5099 2018-12-10 16:26:10 You have to understand this from the point of view of those who watch CNN... Or the View etc  not much common sense or substance in that audience
5100 2018-12-10 16:26:09 Let us save the planet. Right! Keep the coal & oil in the ground. Electric vehicles only. How are they charged? By battery. How are batteries charged? By electricity? What drives electricity: oil, coal. 
We protect theworld with windmills & hope it blows.Power by hope.Watermills?
5101 2018-12-10 16:25:58 I’m out of vitamin e oil...
5102 2018-12-10 16:25:57 Even a lot of the “hippie” food at @sproutsfm and @WholeFoods has palm oil now.
5103 2018-12-10 16:25:49 Of course they did. All are big fossil fuel producers and rather have the planet go to shit than take measures to slow down the catastrophe that's coming. Someone should tell these moronic leaders that neither money nor oil is part of the human diet....
5104 2018-12-10 16:25:47 I'm thinking about the orcish God of Oil
Is a very shiny god. Possibly a solar deity (though their role as patron of fried foods and wrestling is more culturally important)
5105 2018-12-10 16:25:45 "The term has actually been part of the oil industry lexicon for decades, used by geologists and engineers since at least 1939. According to Alberta oil historian David Finch, everyone called them the tar sands until the 1960s, and both “tar sands” and “oil sands” were used"
5106 2018-12-10 16:25:39 acht, dinnae fash yerselves, an independent Scotland  will sell you all the drinking water you need... [and the gas for your heating and oil for your industry and power for your lights and fish for your tea...]  #Scotref

5109 2018-12-10 16:25:25 @CapEconEmerging "The deal reached by OPEC to reduce oil output means that the economic slowdown in the Gulf that we had expected from the middle of next year will now occur earlier and be more severe. Accordingly, we are revising down our GDP growth forecasts for 2019"
5110 2018-12-10 16:25:17 Oil. Lumber. Humour.
5111 2018-12-10 16:25:15 I left the house just to get a oil change and I end up catching a road block fuckkkkk.
5112 2018-12-10 16:25:14 Will Alberta promise to clean up the *inevitable* oil spills into those resources when the pipeline fails?
5113 2018-12-10 16:25:11 空に向かって呟いとくけど、炎上商法って一瞬の衆目集めには効果あるけど大概後のダメージの方が大きいからなぁぁぁぁぁぁ
5114 2018-12-10 16:25:08 Anybody wanna help me out paying for this oil change? Nobody? Cool
5115 2018-12-10 16:25:01 ステージの上で視線も味わってよいですの
5116 2018-12-10 16:24:59 I agree w Mr. Taylor. US shouldn't fight in SCS+TW where China's strong. For a fraction of the cost in losses, US can arm TW w modern weapons especially CBU-filled Tomahawk-sized preemptive mssls. Interdict oil in the IO to starve CN, take away all CN gains from PNG eastward.
5117 2018-12-10 16:24:59 Cold pressed castor oil has less smell, look for it on the lable.
5118 2018-12-10 16:24:51 We could make it with canna oil, and put leaves on top.
5119 2018-12-10 16:24:51 Since our society is still dependent on oil for our very survival would you rather get yours from Canada via pipeline, Canada via rail, or saudi Arabia via ship?
5120 2018-12-10 16:24:49 ま、最終的にくっつくのはさまいちだけどな！
5121 2018-12-10 16:24:46 Don’t we still need oil for electric cars?
5122 2018-12-10 16:24:45 
5123 2018-12-10 16:24:36 Oil is dirty.

5125 2018-12-10 16:24:28 There were some interesting ladies in Jesus family tree: 
Each takes part in God taking human form.
I am celebrating my Saviour's birth this Christmas.
Christmas is better with Jesus to light the way..
My fingers are going numb.
I value human life above oil.
Jesus overcame sin. X
5126 2018-12-10 16:24:24 All these questions like just change my oil
5127 2018-12-10 16:24:23 As Zimbabweans, we should be worried about our online image as a nation.
If onflation is not the problem, then it's fuel or cooking oil but these endless problems shouldn't define us
Let us rebrand and make the right noises once in a while to reach potential investors & tourists

5130 2018-12-10 16:24:04 Trim dulu pake gunting, trus pake Gillette yg khusus women, ada aloenya jadi licinnnn, gak bikin lecet  habis itu oles soothing gel atau organic oil biar gak iritasi
5131 2018-12-10 16:24:01 Production of biodiesel using soya bean oil
5132 2018-12-10 16:23:45 Couldn’t disagree more. Boycotts have *never* been able to shut down an industry. That’s not the point. The point of a boycott is to create economic pain, so that they producers come to the table. And just like with wood, we need to figure out a sustainable food oil economy.
5133 2018-12-10 16:23:39 Who invented crude oil to make world beautiful?
Hey jealousy peoples
On August 28, 1859, George Bissell and Edwin L. Drake made the first successful use of a drilling rig on a well drilled especially to produce oil, at a site on Oil Creek near      Titusville, Pennsylvania.
5134 2018-12-10 16:23:37 right before I beat my meat I whisper to myself "oil on wood, oil on wood" so the clarification on your end is well received thank u
5135 2018-12-10 16:23:34 diesels power vehicles bc they're  in bed with the oil co! A diesel electric hybrid is an efficient option that's been around for almost a century. Why? efficiency ratio!! I put a electric motor hybrid on my 13 hp Kubota that doubled the hp cuts the fuel by 20% and when not out
5136 2018-12-10 16:23:29 Snake oil salesman. This man is the great manipulator.
5137 2018-12-10 16:23:26 I only have one #FTSE100 holding and that's #RRS . Only repositioned 3.5 months ago and it's been a really nice mover ... a 40% gain so far (back to £70/share). Taking profits in 7 other names looking about right (all between 7% to 62% lower). Didn't anticipate oil move however!
5138 2018-12-10 16:23:24 Sooooo JT is an oil baron buying oil and Harper bought none. Hamish wouldn’t buy Saudi oil either I guess??  Poor little Andy and his Hamish hate campaign floundering.
5139 2018-12-10 16:23:22 That reminds me need to get cooking oil & stuffing.
5140 2018-12-10 16:23:20 Under President Obama the U.S. expanded oil and natural gas production, and became a petroleum exporting nation again for the first time in 40 years. 

Trump has done nothing so spectacular. He's still riding Obama's coattails on energy production.
5141 2018-12-10 16:23:19 じろ~はね………銃二……なの……………………あとモブ
5142 2018-12-10 16:23:17 Um, no. Refining the oil & selling the product is the way they profit. Spills are waste, lost profits, and a liability because clean up costs & govt doesn't pay, it fines.
5143 2018-12-10 16:23:14 So far all we have is a brief meeting and a few contacts that went nowhere, and some hush money to hookers. All based on contacts with citizens of one of the world's largest oil producers and militarys. Doesn't sound like a very good case, unless we make Russia per se illegal.
5144 2018-12-10 16:23:08 Unless we need a country’s oil.
5145 2018-12-10 16:23:04 Keeping in mind that the royalties from oil go to help all Canadians...you have to wonder how stupid the Quebec government really is
Plus of course there’s their sewage dumping into the waters and the explosion in Lac Megantic...but those are not important to the eco terrorists

5147 2018-12-10 16:22:39 I need my oil changed befo I get on this road 
5148 2018-12-10 16:22:26 @AdamMancini4 Hi Mr. Mancini, can u do a chart update on oil please? Would really like to see your view on a chart.
5149 2018-12-10 16:22:26 Neither does Alberta!!!!!! Alberta gave away its oil & tar, refused to add value, left tax revenue on the table & did not save for an oiless day. I am so tired of Alberta’s whining while electing con, austerity loving gov’ts. And looks like another coming up!
5150 2018-12-10 16:22:25 Oil.
5151 2018-12-10 16:22:13 Just tried oil pulling with coconut oil and puked so do not recommend.
5152 2018-12-10 16:22:03 Got mine 
5153 2018-12-10 16:22:02 風呂から上がらなきゃならないのに気力がわかない 駄目だ
5154 2018-12-10 16:21:55 cheap energy** subsidizes the whole economy. Right now that energy comes in the form of oil and oil infrastructure, because the most profitable industry in the world pays big money to keep the status quo.
5155 2018-12-10 16:21:52 Global Economy  slowdown, Fed increasing rates, China Trade, Big Tech like Apple slowing, Oil prices back to 50$, credit bubble...everything is pointing to a massive sinister scenario soon. Something needs to be done and done fast.

5158 2018-12-10 16:21:06 Unto which they were added to raise oil production, and therefore allowing families of big household names to siphon off their shares, all the while they were removed from the census in the year 1986 to deny them their human rights and classify them as illegal aliens...cont’d
5159 2018-12-10 16:21:06 Quebec's hypocrisy begins when money enters the picture. They hate oil but don't mind benefiting from it. 
5160 2018-12-10 16:20:58 Cramer is a shill for Trump and Oil.  bye
5161 2018-12-10 16:20:58 いや、寝ろ？ つかまずいい加減風呂から上がれよ
5162 2018-12-10 16:20:43 I had to put warm oil in my ears this morning 
5163 2018-12-10 16:20:39 なんでまだ起きてるんだろうって素で謎に思った
5164 2018-12-10 16:20:25 I need to take my car to get an oil change and cleaned inside and out
5165 2018-12-10 16:20:17 We’ll pay oil marketers 236 Bn by Friday - FG
5166 2018-12-10 16:20:16 Hi Canuck2USA, what about oil? Looking for a bounce or do u think it will move lower?
5167 2018-12-10 16:20:03 Simplest lazy man method. Cook your stew normally, use palm instead of veg oil. Midway add your egusi. If using leaf vegetable, add that las Las. Bachelor egusi is acceptable to kids.
5168 2018-12-10 16:20:02 Top up your gas tank, my friend. Oil price is on the rise.
5169 2018-12-10 16:20:01 Just read this, " Trading algorithms in the oil market generally buy and sell based on price patterns, ignoring fundamental information, which could magnify one-way moves as such programs pile into market trends." Yup that is what algos do. 

Welcome to 2019 everyone.
5170 2018-12-10 16:19:57 I don’t have a problem with renewables,I have a problem with trying to destroy the west’s fossil fuel industry as Quebec imports foreign oil,destroying Canada’s oil industry doesn’t stop the use of oil,oil consumption won’t peak till 2040 doesn’t matter what the UN wants
5171 2018-12-10 16:19:53 The bacteria is not 'used' - it is naturally occurring. Large colonies have been feeding off the natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico long before humans figured out oil was useful.
5172 2018-12-10 16:19:38 The Middle East Peace Ambassador got his oil royalty deal, he and the wife must be past 30 pieces of silver by now.
5173 2018-12-10 16:19:34 coconut oil
5174 2018-12-10 16:19:19 I could just say "oil on wood"

5177 2018-12-10 16:18:57 I like this kid but like Parcells said put away the anointing oil
5178 2018-12-10 16:18:56 what's a bit more time on the hundreds of years of the national rape and depletion of Scottish national recourses ... they must be building another water pipe to England or suppressing the known fact that there's plenty of North Sea oil .
5179 2018-12-10 16:18:53 Heck ya, baby oil with iodine 
5180 2018-12-10 16:18:50 I wish you the best as this is a great movement, but remember that obama resisted big oil and started gigantic solar projects and incentives which made him hated. So dont group all people together.
5181 2018-12-10 16:18:42 so, tell me again WHY we need Saudi Arabian oil?
5182 2018-12-10 16:18:38 The only way I'd buy one of those license plates if Daryl Katz ain't the owner anymore.
5183 2018-12-10 16:18:25 Your comment is ignorant. No systemic risk. No recession. 13x on s&p low oil. Oh yes consumer is 2/3 gdp. Slower growth yes but 5-10% eps in 19. Your sounding emotional and not reality. Uptick rule is the reason and technical trading. Not fundamental or economy driven. Smarten up
5184 2018-12-10 16:18:21 So am I stupid or 'naive'? The cons had full reign of the government for years. Saudi oil was bought pipelines were blocked and deficit was paid by selling stuff we can't get back. They spent their time gaging scientists and being afraid of gay marriage.
5185 2018-12-10 16:18:20 Interested in #trading #commodities but not familiar with the #futures market? You can always consider an #ETF that is designed to track that #commodity. Some popular commodity #ETFs include $GLD for #gold, $SLV for #silver, $USO for #oil and $UNG for #naturalgas
5186 2018-12-10 16:18:20 So the employees of various oil companies donated to a candidate, Beto, that SUPPORTS positive action on climate change.
5187 2018-12-10 16:18:19 Burn fat not oil
5188 2018-12-10 16:18:03 In other words, Trugrope is happy that gender means in some other countries and will happily cripple Canada’s economy and continue to bring in Saudi oil. His inside voice is screaming ‘quit picking on me, going to need a big dubbie after this session’....
5189 2018-12-10 16:18:02 I told my boyfriend I miss being home because of my art. When I was done rinsing the dye out of my hair, he had turned his desk into a workspace pulling out fresh canvas, water color, oil, acrylics and I don’t think I’m ever going home.
5190 2018-12-10 16:17:56 sana oil
5191 2018-12-10 16:17:48 They think they’re “winning” by spreading this nonsense on twitter. Whereas folks in the oil and gas industry just laugh at them.
5192 2018-12-10 16:17:46 How? You don't know? Wow!

Well, oil prices contracted, and there was reduced forex, GEJ and his goons made sure they depleted our reserves despite selling oil above 100$, there was no fx to support import as a consequence, resulting in the inevitable devaluation, inflation etc.
5193 2018-12-10 16:17:46 So he doesn't get any favours from the incumbent government? Getting to mine the ONGC oil reserves, defence deals are all just a happy coincidence 
5194 2018-12-10 16:17:42 จะหิวอะไรนักหนาว่ะในชีวิต
5195 2018-12-10 16:17:36 And he might get away with phasing out oil if he had a robust plan for diversifying the economy. But no, Trudeau is the domestic destroyer.
5196 2018-12-10 16:17:30 Canada is a dynamic country with lots of resources and well educated population. We don't nor shouldn't make the country cap in hand to one resource or to one province. We sink or swim by our own innovation not oil.
5197 2018-12-10 16:17:28 fuck yall, cremate my ass i aint wanna be someones oil for they rocket boosters in 3018
5198 2018-12-10 16:17:24 exactly... it's a very effective oil cooler... when flying in 40 degree air, it's a bit TOO effective.
5199 2018-12-10 16:17:23 8 days burning oil? consumerism? hanukkah is cancelled, tu-bishvat forever.
5200 2018-12-10 16:17:21 And it’s costing them 4 times as much to extract it, and at a catastrophic cost to the environment to boot. Oil is old hat. But I’m sure future generations inheriting what’s left to them will surely look back and find consolation in the short term profit margins.
5201 2018-12-10 16:16:59 I went in for a $30 oil change left spending 250
5202 2018-12-10 16:16:55 We produce more oil than Dubai - where has all the money gone for the last 40 years. It certainly didn't come to Scotland. Open your eyes you pointless vassal.
5203 2018-12-10 16:16:46 You know Bill, you keep crying for attention on here and trying to sell snake oil. Give me a call I can help you get a grip. You sound like a 5 year old, but you are not, you are supposed to be a man and a smart one!

5209 2018-12-10 16:16:16 Your DM is closed.
5210 2018-12-10 16:16:15 So we're to believe all that oil disappeared due a leak and no one noticed, bwoy Jamaican people really siddung and make unuh tek dem fi fool. Misappropriation of funds, theft!!! Certain people names nahh call but they're an intricate part of the problem...

5213 2018-12-10 16:16:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or revisit them.
5214 2018-12-10 16:16:06 @SpeakerRyan is nothing but an empty suit, snake oil salesman. Sure, he eats better and works out, but his moral compass points in the same direction as Trump. Why did the media ever take him seriously? I have an English degree, but I could out debate him on fiscal policy.
5215 2018-12-10 16:16:03 And it has a thick peel with plenty essential aromatic oil in it
5216 2018-12-10 16:15:50 I know. They were just "lucky" to be situated over an oil patch...

5222 2018-12-10 16:15:10 We have 27,000  climate-related data sets at our disposal, and sea surface and land surface temperature anomaly are only two of them.  Don’t be “smocked”, but climate denial propaganda doesn’t even make a dent, in that mass of understanding. 

Judith, oil heiress, Curry? OMG 
5223 2018-12-10 16:15:09 And tasty-looking.  Throw a little olive oil on there?.... delish.
5224 2018-12-10 16:15:07 Things the GOP are doing.

Reshaping the judiciary
Deregulating the economy
More drilling for oil.
Undermining Obamacare.

Things the left are doing.

Banning 70 year old songs.

Alienating classical liberals.

Ensuring Trump a 2nd term.

Try harder, Democrats.
5225 2018-12-10 16:15:04 This weekend I was so high on edibles weed and oil lol
5226 2018-12-10 16:14:55 Thank you. We need all the luck we can get. I think we will make it though.
5227 2018-12-10 16:14:54 Walking around where I work, I rush past it all and make an oil rig wink to me far far away
5228 2018-12-10 16:14:52 Malaysian Palm Oil Board reported #palmoil stocks at end of November rose to 3.007 mmts from 2.722 mmts in October. This is well above year ago stocks of 2.554 mmts and the highest on record.

5232 2018-12-10 16:14:24 With our 13th Age campaign at an end and peace restored to the land, my orc monk, Jevin, can finally return to his true calling: slutting it up and orcish oil wrestling.
5233 2018-12-10 16:14:20 Kena cuci muka dlm masa 60 saat at least 2X sehari pg & sebelum tido...kalau consistent nnt kulit jd smooth & nk berminyak tu dh kurang la..
(p/s: selalunya ai lps cuci muka b4 tido tu mmg akn apply argan oil (Sephia by JN) sikit kat muka sbb esk pg muka akn nmpk fresh) 
5234 2018-12-10 16:14:07 Sama ih. Ga cocok pake yg ungu deep cleanser sama complete white, jadinya malah jerawatan, tp cocok pas pake yg oil control, jerawat jd cepet kempes

5238 2018-12-10 16:13:55 Justin Trudeau imports oil?
5239 2018-12-10 16:13:54 Snake oil salesmen can only exist when there are rubes who will buy it.  Sadly there are plenty who will...who see believing facts that reflect badly on Trump as acts of disloyalty.
5240 2018-12-10 16:13:46 CBD is just hemp oil and @ForiaPleasure just dropped some CBD only ones this week
5241 2018-12-10 16:13:42 Yeah but oil so...
#PrettyMuchBalancesOutRight
5242 2018-12-10 16:13:40 Oil, Assets, Land and GOLD!!!!!!!!
5243 2018-12-10 16:13:33 The market and therefore the price of oil is global. Therefore increasing the supply of it or lowering the price anywhere tends to lower the price internationally.
5244 2018-12-10 16:13:29 I’ve bitten the bullet CBD oil ordered...2019 there will be a new me #MS #hadenoughofthis
5245 2018-12-10 16:13:27 Hari ini pake peeling serum aja. Ga pake face oil dulu.
5246 2018-12-10 16:13:25 In travesty of 'justice,' judge Keith Comeaux admits pipeline co. BBP violated law & stole land, but allows it to carry on pumping oil, pocket profit & keep what it stole for tiny token ($150) payout to victims. This is what passes for 'justice' in a country run by corporations.
5247 2018-12-10 16:13:08 Good,if people are so concerned,there’s options,the problem is most are just hypocritical,bla,bla oil if it’s Canadian oil but then drive their SUV and trucks,highest sellers in Quebec and welcome Saudi oil tankers sailing down th St Lawrence
5248 2018-12-10 16:13:04 the oil producers
5249 2018-12-10 16:13:03 What JimandJared or anybody else on NPR wont be talking about today or ever..
1) the newly open investigation into Clinton
2)that this has turned from Russian collusion into merely paying off pornstars
3) for the first time in 75 years the US is no longer dependent on foreign oil

5251 2018-12-10 16:12:55 6 cyl BMWs (before turbos) were like this.  Excluding oil changes, 95% of the time and money I put into my highest mile BMW between 100k and 250k is the exact same stuff I expect to have to do on my Tesla by the time I reach 250k.
5252 2018-12-10 16:12:51 And you are a certified bag of dog doo and hair oil.  Eeewww.
5253 2018-12-10 16:12:48 God this here is for grown up no child will digest all of this we know God is at the helm n our faith is covered by prayer which is the motor or our walk as christians prayer is da oil dat moves the mechinery but the Holy spirit allows us to hear Gods voice yet we gotta be clean
5254 2018-12-10 16:12:42 I’m about to get my oil changed and all 4 tires today. No more putting it off 
5255 2018-12-10 16:12:41 Bringing in oil from oss shore plays to the east as there is NO CARBON TAX ON THAT OIL so its cheaper
5256 2018-12-10 16:12:34 Rather get dry sage/sage sticks that you can burn few minutes before you Sleep if the smoke bothers you try the sage oil drops and just sprinkle a bit around your room as you pray. It doesn't necessarily carry supernatural powers but it calms you down
5257 2018-12-10 16:12:33 So you just proved the point that Trump did better on manufacturing jobs despite oil prices staying low.  Thanks!!

Nice chart.   You must be so proud of your charts.  Lots of lines and pretty pictures.
5258 2018-12-10 16:12:31 Clove oil and acetaminophen are the only things I've found that really help that acute pain.
5259 2018-12-10 16:12:28 Energy East is a national and international security issue and must be constructed immediately. We need to be able to provide oil to our NATO Allies in Great Britain and Europe in case of probable Russian aggression. Looks like we will need also as Trump will side with Russia.
5260 2018-12-10 16:12:23 Andrew gonna come tell us $5bn JMD worth of oil leaked? PetroJam inefficient due to its age?
5261 2018-12-10 16:12:21 Buy it now since Trump has made oil so cheap.
5262 2018-12-10 16:12:21 I just moved to a place with a glass top electric stove so I was like, “this will basically act as a comal, right?” Wrong! I use a cast iron skillet with a little oil!
5263 2018-12-10 16:12:04 ThePivotKing have u bought OIL? Still 55.23 live?
5264 2018-12-10 16:12:01 I really wanna go get CBD oil 
5265 2018-12-10 16:11:59 Oui, enfin si je puis me permettre, la langue romane dite français est une langue d’oïl, une langue du nord ; ce n'est pas l'italien. Le français (ou plutôt le roman) des Serments de Strasbourg, langue que je connais, ressemblait à l'espagnol et pourtant on n'était pas en Espagne

5267 2018-12-10 16:11:53 Le preocupa (a la petrolera) que suspendieron la ronda que se realizaría en febrero, ya que las que se han licitado aún no han dado resultados y sólo especulan, como la venta de oil & gas a una alemana

5269 2018-12-10 16:11:49 Who trynna help me change my oil
5270 2018-12-10 16:11:42 A busy start to the week for us with a  clutch replacement on a Volkswagen polo. Oil leak and MOT on a BMW. 2 diagnosis jobs on an insignia and Renault. All done and ready to smash Tuesday! #HappyMonday #xmascountdown @BeckBromFL #BeckBromFL
5271 2018-12-10 16:11:20 Why is that not a surprise? Canada is made up of just two provinces, Quebec and Ont in that order. AB’s oil money have made these two super rich.  What  do we get now? A kick in the butt. The West needs to organize again
5272 2018-12-10 16:11:19 It will
1. Help me fill my 5kg gas N1, 800
2. Get me Rice, Tin Tomatoes and Groundnut Oil all worth N2, 000
3. Then I Use N1, 200 for miscellaneous(transport to work and any other minor expenses)
5273 2018-12-10 16:11:17 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
5274 2018-12-10 16:11:14 LOL it's fine I forgot to put the coconut oil this time 
5275 2018-12-10 16:11:05 Lol, take my hate off to the best snake oil salesman of all time.
5276 2018-12-10 16:11:05 Oh they'll never get into the EU as an independent nation without paying a big price. 

On the subject of independence itself though lots planned that didn't need negotiation. If you want to set a fund for oil cash, you just do it. Don't need to ask a third party.
5277 2018-12-10 16:10:59 An ungodly amount of garlic in some olive oil on the pan, and salt, pepper, and coriander on the chicken to start with. From there it varies: rosemary or thyme or ras el hanout or curry or something else, pepper melange (black, white, green, pink), nutmeg, it varies...
5278 2018-12-10 16:10:49 it levels your knowledge up thou. 6 mins in you'll learn that in 05 there was an energy bill pushed through Congress that exempts the oil and natural gas industries from the Safe Drinking Water Act & Halliburton technology which is also fucked up. watch it and lmk ur thoughts
5279 2018-12-10 16:10:15  homies I gotta shovel some oil contaminated gravel and this shit is frozen smfh
5280 2018-12-10 16:10:14 DD以外のことかな？だったら別にいいけどww
5281 2018-12-10 16:10:11 And Alberta's still fucking up: if we had a PST, our government would be able to pay for stuff without going cap in hand to the oil industry.
5282 2018-12-10 16:10:09 Why would they? It challenges their conservative Christian ideals and isn’t oil or some other major industry. so much for separation of church and state. That died long ago.
5283 2018-12-10 16:10:05 Need US oil exports to be north of 3 MBD but imports dip down below 7 MBD. This week may be a 10 MM barrels crude draw event.
5284 2018-12-10 16:10:04 Моя подруга вечно сидела в тви. Я смотрела, читала твиты, что она читала, орала с мемов. И себе скачала.
Хотя, впервые я зарегалась в лет восемь. Сразу же свалила, потому что, типа "для чего вообще нужнен тви? Игр нет, музыки нет, ограничение тупое". Теперь стыдно за себя мелкую
5285 2018-12-10 16:10:03 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。

5289 2018-12-10 16:09:27 congratulations,
in addition ? is cheese ok, ?white or others?
? any nuts ok? almondes, cashew, peanuts..?
? oils/ olive, sesame oil, seed oils , fruit oils..?
i just wondered about above additions. otherwise your recipe is complete though,
5290 2018-12-10 16:09:27 Is it groundnut oil or!! Me not getting
5291 2018-12-10 16:09:12 You can’t express any hardship around older black folks. THEY WILL ONE UP YOU EVERYTIME! Man said back in 89’ we had a truck on the yard that everytime you turn the corner the door would fly open.  I just said I needed an oil change dawg.
5292 2018-12-10 16:09:09 Other than oil changes, EVs are absolutely no different than an ICE with an incredibly reliable engine and transmission (think manual, not automatic).
All the other stuff people go to a mechanic for (suspension, brakes, u-joints, bushings, etc) are exactly the same as ICE.
5293 2018-12-10 16:09:00 Albertans don't hate equalization. We get it. But when the biggest beneficiary attacks our oil business, the source of those benefits, we get a bit cranky. But just keep on fanning the flames CBC.

5301 2018-12-10 16:07:48 The rest of the world is trying to make it carbon neutral and you set up a promotion of coal and oil in the same place the rest of the world are working to end our reliance on fossil fuel. Gross stupidity doesn't start to cover it.
5302 2018-12-10 16:07:44 At least tim hortons took off since i was last there so i should be able to get breakfast that isnt bread with olive oil

5304 2018-12-10 16:07:37 Turkana should actually receive 100% of its oil revenue
5305 2018-12-10 16:07:33 Actually, this might be another issue for me — I am generally not a fan of sweet sauces. So any tomato pie that has that I’m even more irritated by. 

Just give me the crust covered in olive oil and garlic and some spices, for gods' sake.
5306 2018-12-10 16:07:32 *Trudeau didn't kill the oilfield. Global oil prices have dropped by around 35% in the last 3months. Oil sands cost a LOT more than Saudi Sweet crude to refine for gasoline.
5307 2018-12-10 16:07:29 50% of oil production, and 50% of whiskey and shortbread or no deal.
5308 2018-12-10 16:07:29 I know I'm a very fortunate Canadian.

The common ground I could have supported: for the federal gov't to pour billions of $ into a clean energy future that includes a just transition, retraining & $ for those affected by the declining oil industry. Not billions to save it.
5309 2018-12-10 16:07:28 Oil West Texas Intermediate crude  finished a solid week at t $52.61/barrel last week, after #OPEC and its allies agreed to cut production for the first half of 2019, gold closed at $1,250.40 /ounce  #oil #gold #Nymex #comex @reuters
5310 2018-12-10 16:07:27 The biggest issue by far though is the staff and who does or doesn't have access to the layout. The playing around with figurines and clear damage/chipping down to mishandling and overhandling, and as merch pointed out the oil being plastered all over isn't helping them at all
5311 2018-12-10 16:07:25 And returned the $300,000,000 tax incentives for the oil companies in Alberta that harper canceled
5312 2018-12-10 16:07:19 But it's midnight and I've got my norco, CBD oil, and Tension Tamer at the ready.

5322 2018-12-10 16:06:26 The Russian economy is dead. China and Europe are making gains in cutting the ties to Russian gas and oil. Arms is all they have.
5323 2018-12-10 16:06:23 oi - - - ^sigh^ - - - US, us standing with the international scumbags. I guess we're just lucky they put off the vote on fixing the price of human life per barrel of oil.
5324 2018-12-10 16:06:22 Hi Mark, palm oil is a very big focus for us right now and we're pleased to confirm that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our snacks. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email us at hello@graze.com

5330 2018-12-10 16:05:41 Always liked Sterling, even when he left us. A young man who is doing his thing. Maybe he comes back to Liverpool if City loses the oil money or if Pep leaving 
5331 2018-12-10 16:05:33 Definitely the stuff they sellin ain’t the same as the proper oil, no point sayin it is...enough ordinary irish people with rights have suffered long enough, like they can make clinics for heroin addicts to use safely, but this is wrong, it makes me sick #timeforchange
5332 2018-12-10 16:05:31 Peppermint oil in the diffuser= perfection
5333 2018-12-10 16:05:30 So 4.5 billion to buy a pipeline, billions more to twin it, twice enhancing ei payments, possibly buying rail cars and receiving more revenue from federal transfers than from your oil and gas sector, is not enough help? 
5334 2018-12-10 16:05:24 When the entire Global Countries won't exist to Who the Oil will sell ?
5335 2018-12-10 16:05:24 Won’t happen any time soon because your republican leadership is in bed with the oil companies.
5336 2018-12-10 16:05:19 A jar with mini hot peppers from guadeloupe and olive oil.
5337 2018-12-10 16:05:18 IMO the only way to transform the oil and gas industry is to put it out of business.
5338 2018-12-10 16:05:14 They have a boatload of North Sea Oil. A small population and for the most part a singular culture. Not saying it's bad, but it is unique.

5341 2018-12-10 16:05:10 No.  That is not what I said.  I don't think the wars were motivated by Darwinian worldview but dollar hegemony, oil, ect.
5342 2018-12-10 16:05:05 Or when you either din't believe, choose not to believe or just don't care that we are killing our planet....because oil is $$$$

5346 2018-12-10 16:04:58 Time after time,
these wings unfold from an oil slick,

and swallow the onyx night whole,
your words held soft within my down
assuaging this ache til dawn.

5354 2018-12-10 16:04:19 There's a common thread. The reason it is now discussed.. "money". Canada is feeling economic pain, Alberta is taking the brunt of it. Perhaps Alberta should  pay the tranfer portion of fed. taxes in barrels of oil set at world prices while the market pays 75% less.

5357 2018-12-10 16:04:08 Two presidents can be bad. One certainly worse than others. I want a president that isn’t a war monger and doesn’t support oil companies. That’s my comment. Don’t care if it’s helpful to you or not.

5359 2018-12-10 16:04:02 Once again great news for America but ignored by the fake media but it wasn't ignored by Barack Obama who tried to take credit for it after years of shutting down oil exploration and demanding clean energy how disgraceful is he?
5360 2018-12-10 16:03:51 We were having practical class on how to make Salad and smoothies. My teacher in 2002 was complaining about Nigeria's economy. Penny wise, pounds foolish she said, we produce raw crude  oil, we cannot refine it, we take it abroad and bring it back in its refined state.
5361 2018-12-10 16:03:49 The global NEED for oil will still exist long after we are gone. Subsidies don’t = cash. Tax breaks or incentives mean they pay less as they create jobs, and transfer payments, etc. Don’t believe everything the Liberals tell you. Canada doesn’t have a problem as they suggest.

5378 2018-12-10 16:02:43 Quebec doesn't buy oil, private companies in Quebec do. They do it to maximize profits. Hope this helps.
5379 2018-12-10 16:02:33 Well, being mad at QC for their rhetoric on the fossil fuel industry is one thing, but it's not really related to EQ transfers. EQ transfers sending federal tax dollars to poor provinces isn't in any way what's hampering AB's oil and gas industry.

5384 2018-12-10 16:02:23 Last I checked, it cost us something like $40/barrel to extract lower quality oil from the tar sands, compared to $9/barrel for higher quality in SA. It's hard to compete.

5428 2018-12-10 15:59:32 @realDonaldTrump thinks low oil prices are great for the USA, the leading producer of oil in the world. He does realize we sell the oil that we produce, right?
5429 2018-12-10 15:59:24 You mean oil? IF a pipeline were built, yes it would lower the costs and make it more competitive with Saudi oil but then we'd still need to deal with the quality issue.
5430 2018-12-10 15:59:20 Could be wastage , technical issues. Wow waow $5billion worth of wastage?

5451 2018-12-10 15:57:30 Time after time,
these wings unfold from an oil slick,
thoughts polluted by the dark
as as I'm washed up on a moonless shore

I close my eyes
and imagine a garland of stars 
an ancient amulet around the throat of night

dreaming deep
until I see you
and remember flight.

5501 2018-12-10 15:53:45 Oil of oregano is fucking intense but I really feel it working!
5502 2018-12-10 15:53:38 OMG....
5503 2018-12-10 15:53:38 It’s the old game of keeping the cult together. See also Scientology. These are very old snake oil salesmen routines that shut be easy to break apart.
5504 2018-12-10 15:53:37 When nakatira si marie ng virgin oil ni cheska da great
5505 2018-12-10 15:53:35 The gov't has a significant hand determining whether a net-exporter also needs to import because they can't get sufficient oil from one side of the country to the other.

The debate is about energy independence and not supporting terrible foreign regimes through oil purchases.
5506 2018-12-10 15:53:26 How tf is it an 1.5 hour wait for a 40k maintenance when I had an appointment....the only thing actually being changed is the oil...it’ll take 10 mins.... just give me the tools and I’ll do it.
5507 2018-12-10 15:53:26 Why is this EXPIRED and FRAUDULENT British govt created Country not disbanded by REFERENDUM?. Do our politicians benefit from this Corruption?.All we hear is Arabia while GENOCIDE and Fraud is ongoing against Hebrew Biafra to steal oil and gas.
5508 2018-12-10 15:53:19 Trying to convince myself not to throw up: youre not nauseous...you just need some lavender oil to smell, ginger root to chew on, and some fresh air!! you only need all these things, right now, to not fucking throw up
5509 2018-12-10 15:53:15 Girl I wish my dealership would give me a $30 buck discount  I need to get tires and oil change this month 
5510 2018-12-10 15:53:00 Well, its made out of all herb and oils, rosemary infused castor oil,coconut oil and castor oil and its also homemade. so far Ive been using it for almost 10 months I think, it has done justice to my brows & lashes indeed 
5511 2018-12-10 15:52:58 So much for Pro-Life, if abortion was a men’s issue you could have one while getting the oil changed in your truck.
5512 2018-12-10 15:52:51 Without global warming we still need climate scientists. Also, if it wasnt a big issue they would research something else

Take my word on it, scientists do  not make nearly the same salary as those in finance or oil.

Seriously you need to think more than a half a step ahead.
5513 2018-12-10 15:52:48 J'me sens bête un peu, est-ce que t'as capté?
5514 2018-12-10 15:52:46 Didnt realize America was a 3rd world country.... 
Also, why are 3rd world countries who produce oil, like Iraq, selling it instead of keeping it? 3rd world countries need food & stability, not oil !?
5515 2018-12-10 15:52:43 fanatical extremists are made not born, mitigating arguments should dominate any interpretation of MENA region, west served it poorly no more than itself, oil has become the black death for many ppl instead of life shud represent, US 5% of world pop' used 70%+ world oil 90's

5517 2018-12-10 15:52:29 Bought some organic essential oil massage oil yesterday, and ladies... 
If you are tired of your hands hurting after 2 minutes or the lotion soaking in too fast to give your mans a back massage, MASSAGE OIL IS A MIRACLE! Plus you will both smell bomb asf after & be stress free
5518 2018-12-10 15:52:28 Arrows with bronze heads and oil soaked cloth.
5519 2018-12-10 15:52:21 Why is almost everyone thinking that everyone in the video is scooping the oil in order to sell it? Is this how you are?
5520 2018-12-10 15:52:21 No one here does the oil menorah? That’s the original way on doing it.
5521 2018-12-10 15:52:14 Olive oil didn’t make you lose weight!

5526 2018-12-10 15:51:41 Nothing like a fresh oil change 
5527 2018-12-10 15:51:32 You ascribe too much influence to this Buhari up to making people scoop oil from the gutter. Haba
5528 2018-12-10 15:51:29 The oil billionaires and millionaires need more money to upgrade their yachts and mansions, hence we must accelerate the climate change catastrophe. Insane.
5529 2018-12-10 15:51:25 웅팀장 요세 좀 많이 힘든가봐
5530 2018-12-10 15:51:11 بلكي ما عم يسمع الكلمة من معلمينو مثل ما لازم وخايف على حالو 
5531 2018-12-10 15:51:11 I agree there is there poverty, but this is stipid, how can u be scooping oil from gutter to sell or use, what if the tanker did not fell, will they not live or get something else to eat, everything should not be govt, we also constitute to d problem .
5532 2018-12-10 15:51:06 @DamienShort @RobertCPalmer13 #barcaspurs presser in background as I look at new data we just finished compiling for Water Vs Gas/Oil in 2,200 fracked wells
5533 2018-12-10 15:50:59 For the first time in 75 years, the United States exported more oil than it imported #energyindependence
5534 2018-12-10 15:50:53 how am I supposed to know if my car has an oil leak
5535 2018-12-10 15:50:52 Yesterday we got a snow storm, leaving us without electricity!We do however have a generator and gas logs so no worries.I like once in a while living the pioneer life.Oil laterns and cooking on a camp stove.
5536 2018-12-10 15:50:49 Yeah, working at starving the constituents and tanking their oil production.
5537 2018-12-10 15:50:42 Allah Oga wai ta dan kware ne fa shikenan
5538 2018-12-10 15:50:35 "against all secret wars" could you tell us what country was & still is allowing ISIS foreigner fighters to enter Syria? The country which has been buying ISIS oil? The country which has jailed more than 50000 of its own citizens over one night? For no reason?
5539 2018-12-10 15:50:34 That oil panic mini i wanted to put the spotlight on an unknown youtuber who is deaf.
5540 2018-12-10 15:50:33 @guarnaschelli I’m going to buy and try truffle oil for the 1st time. Should I buy black or white? Is one better than the other? Thanks!
5541 2018-12-10 15:50:33 Still bitter about nobody listening to you on how to vote, or on oil trains, or ports, or anything else of consequence? LOL
5542 2018-12-10 15:50:31 生きたはいいけど向こう保険加入してないわ、車の賠償全部払えないいうわ、保険金も払えないとかいうこちらが建て替え借金地獄だから車はきをつけてね
5543 2018-12-10 15:50:18 Venezuelan oil burns cleaner, it’s just science
5544 2018-12-10 15:50:09 Scheer is an idiot, but if you don't think government policy has a huge influence on where we get our oil from, that's naïve.

If you think it's fine to place environmental or gender standards on the Canadian oil industry that kills it, while letting the market use Oil from.
..
5545 2018-12-10 15:49:46 Just bought some beard oil and the label states it's ''vegan friendly'' uwotm8
5546 2018-12-10 15:49:45 No I don’t agree. There are major pipelines that need to be built. None of which are underway. This is due to American influence land locking AB oil. They do not want tide water competition. They want our oil at major discounts.
5547 2018-12-10 15:49:37 Mr. Bernier,
We in Alberta are sick and tired of the arrogance in Ottawa and the constant shake down from Quebec. Why does Quebec continue to benefit from transfer payments whilst showing a surplus? Blocking our industry yet importing oil from Saudi Arabia! Ça suffit!!!!
5548 2018-12-10 15:49:34 Oil change $80 and na just Toyota. Jesus save us all.
5549 2018-12-10 15:49:32 ...I'll tell you what does portray the queen in a negative light: the multiple discovered ceramic oil lamps from the 1st century AD showing Cleopatra in the nude and sitting on a giant phallus while riding an Egyptian crocodile. LOL. Erotic art was common but this was a shaming.
5550 2018-12-10 15:49:32 Do we have enough oil to make it worthwhile tho
5551 2018-12-10 15:49:25 Nope... It's a drink...

5560 2018-12-10 15:48:45 Oil markets need all the help they can against hedge funds gone wild
5561 2018-12-10 15:48:40 Norway is in the SM but not in the customs union, which allows it to set its own tariffs on goods imported outwith the EU. It's not in the CFP.

Norway has approx 5.7m pop and oil/gas, 2nd richest in EU.
Scotland has approx 5.5m pop and more oil/gas, the UK is 12th in EU.
5562 2018-12-10 15:48:36 You have to give a seed offering in faith. Send me $10,000 and I’ll pray for God to multiply that seed offering times ten. I’ll also send you an anointed prayer towel and vial of precious oil.

5577 2018-12-10 15:47:52 Hahaha
5578 2018-12-10 15:47:44 It’s a subversive attack on oil. And they think we should pay more money to solve it. Mother Nature don’t care. If they want to really do something then get China to stop polluting the Ocean.

And then watch him tell you "Hey IDIOT USA needs the oil so go pound sand." You will learn a valuable lesson about the reality of, er, realpolitik. Look it up sport.

5598 2018-12-10 15:46:20 CRUDE OIL

Black market crude oil price right now is $15 per barrel.

And the Black Market is at least 30% of the global market as we tweet.

5602 2018-12-10 15:46:08 Check your Engine oil today.
5603 2018-12-10 15:46:07 Where was the Federalism when few individuals owned these oil blocks?
5604 2018-12-10 15:46:06 Like it need to oil
5605 2018-12-10 15:45:56 doesn't it taste like 
KFC but with less oil? 
I also want to have some
but I'm shy
5606 2018-12-10 15:45:54 Glad you've made the link between stolen land and stolen resources whether oil or artefacts.
5607 2018-12-10 15:45:51 Well the “bump” to my 401k has been a net loss due to the other spook he’s introduced with his Fart of the Deal but you go on and keep preaching snake oil.
5608 2018-12-10 15:45:48 そういえば神威もクリスマスモードだ
5609 2018-12-10 15:45:48 On Friday my mans took my car to get a oil change , without me asking and filled my tank. It’s seriously the little things , got me wondering what i do to deserve such a good man
5610 2018-12-10 15:45:47 They are all the same mate; snake oil salesmen
5611 2018-12-10 15:45:44 Palm oil production is ruining habitat & I avoid it in all ways possible. Population is a huge issue too. So many problems. Corrupt, greedy governments are a huge part of the problem.
5612 2018-12-10 15:45:40 Hold on.

The Prime Minster is currently demanding the house be honest in what they want from Brexit.

The woman who has repeatedly lied and done the opposite of what she has said, and changed her outlook by whatever means to hang on to power

Snake oil saleswoman.
5613 2018-12-10 15:45:30 GODDAM ESSENTIAL OIL VAPING PEN ADS!!!
5614 2018-12-10 15:45:25 while I do believe taxing oil companies would be an effective way to fund subsidizing other forms of energy, i was specifically pointing to the fact that private consumers aren’t really the culprits when it comes to consumption so taxes levied at them are misguided
5615 2018-12-10 15:45:23 I can’t stand when they put oil on my hands after my manicure . It’s makes the gel polish look so dull .
5616 2018-12-10 15:45:21 Rebecca Solnit phrased it well: Axis of Oil.
5617 2018-12-10 15:45:11 I'll split time w/ Will and take the other two weeks

The pwnage would be unprecedented
5618 2018-12-10 15:45:11 My check engine light went off as soon as I put new oil lmao. 

Sick one
5619 2018-12-10 15:45:02 The oil industry is more aligned with Russia and Saudi Arabia than they are with the United States.
5620 2018-12-10 15:45:01 Everyone stay away from me, I’m an essential oil bomb
5621 2018-12-10 15:44:55 “She don’t use jelly, she uses vaaaaaaaaseline”

Woah woah woah, does she not know that oil based lubricants damage the condom? You better tell her to use something water based and if she resists, get out of there. Safety first, Wayne Coyne.
5622 2018-12-10 15:44:53 This literally is not how markets work. If Alberta didn't have oil, the economy would already be more diverse. Resources get allocated to where they're needed in a market economy
5623 2018-12-10 15:44:53 อยากมีทั้งเพื่อนเเละเเฟนนน!!!
5624 2018-12-10 15:44:50 Yes I have also seen suez canal wouldn't allow it to pass through aswell, looks like the best of the options after all. Just such a lot of oil to burn. Also read decommissioning costs would be ridiculously high. So I need a large slice of humble pie.
5625 2018-12-10 15:44:50 this means that despite oil boom, PDP could not lift Nigerians out of poverty. from 2015 when Buhari took over, the figures grew by 10% despite over 50% drop in oil revenue and recession.

5627 2018-12-10 15:44:44 I love those who lament QC fiscal management while ignoring that AB, with the highest gdp per capita in the country, has been struggling with its fiscal situation for years, and was running deficits at $100+ oil.

5632 2018-12-10 15:44:25 You never know unless you try... Continuous use of rice bran oil canola oil will lead to joint aches... Please avoid it.. :)
5633 2018-12-10 15:44:20 The extracts are a far higher concentration and will show effects faster. It's pretty bitter, so don't go too heavy handed without some balance from garlic, sweet veggies like carrots and zucchini and butter or good olive oil.
5634 2018-12-10 15:44:18 A message from Pakistani elite on Human Rights Day: 

1. Forget about what China is doing – as China gives dollars;

2. Forget about what Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen and Syria – we need more money and oil...

5640 2018-12-10 15:42:57 Sadly - you continue to sound like an oil industry apologist. Telling me what other countries are doing to produce oil as an excuse for Canada to expand oil production when we face the crisis of #climatechange sure sounds like an oil industry apologist. Give your head a shake.

5644 2018-12-10 15:42:36 Respectfully...isn’t this outdated?  I expect this assumes Russia’s reliance on its natural gas and oil, and no change in the demand for its product, as an example?  Countries like the former are trying to rig the game for themselves, despite global demand for other resources.

5649 2018-12-10 15:42:22 Oh baby noooooo you’re stripping too much off your face you need to fix your cleanser to moisturizer balance. Cosrx Low ph cleanser is a great alternative (as long as your face tolerates tea tree oil) but really you need to add more moisture
5650 2018-12-10 15:42:18 I have been happy with Benefit's Total Moisture cream. 

I have been previously happy with Neutrogena and Oil of Olay creams.

Can you assure customers this will be rectified? Thanks
5668 2018-12-10 15:40:59 He didn't want a 302 to appear with a different answer. He needs to be indicted and a "Real Prosecuter" show him just what is needed for a conviction. Then he might oil up his G-Man jaws and start taking like he has the runs and the two holder has one spot open. He needs 2 dump.

5724 2018-12-10 15:37:14 We did it because we had an interest in keeping oil prices low under the friendly regime of our ally Kuwait. The price of oil would have gone up drastically for us if Kuwait remained under the control of Iraq.
5725 2018-12-10 15:37:07 Still the fact remains that Quebec gets billions of dollars from the provinces that it spits on. Quebec hates AB, but buys oil from the Saudi's, Quebec says AB is dirty, yet it dumps millions of gallons of sewage in the waterways. It's the hypocrisy that people hate.

5793 2018-12-10 15:31:05 Canada get to save our Livable World if Alberta Oil stays in the ground & we move in National Emergency Mode to convert to Sustainable Carbon Free Energy Like Solar Wind Tidal & Geothermal - No new oil wells or mines No more pipelines @RachelNotley

5798 2018-12-10 15:30:36 Agree with you on the Saudis though the $5/gas thing is a created situation but not by them by ourselves. The US can be oil independent if we choose to be but due to several things we choose not to be. And none of which have anything to do with hybrids

5808 2018-12-10 15:29:32 Many use oil menorah's ---in keeping with the miracle.
Or----there are longer candles that can be used in standard sized menorah's that burn better and longer.
5809 2018-12-10 15:29:32 Melt 1tbsp olive oil & butter in a pan, add 6 cloves microplane grated garlic, 1 tbsp oregano, and a pinch of cayenne or 1 tsp smoked paprika. Sauté until fragrant. Add a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes. Transfer to slow cooker. Nestle in an onion cut in half. Cover w/whole basil

5812 2018-12-10 15:29:24 I think there’s issues with utilitarianism as proposed by Bentham, because taken to an extreme it has potential for justifying harm to any individual or minority group. Evict native tribe to drill for oil? Seize grandma’s house to build Trump hotel? Great for everyone but them.

5816 2018-12-10 15:28:34 A good reason for using oil instead of candles - they last for hours.

5827 2018-12-10 15:27:41 #am2dm typically use tony chachere's creole seasoning (i've upgraded from lawry's). if i'm doing a chicken breast to use for other meals a simple salt 'n' pepa sprinkle; let it sit for a 2min while the oil heats, add seasoned side down to oil & season the other side.
5828 2018-12-10 15:27:41 You do know that there is a difference between burning oil and using it for plastics and things, right? You do know the latter represent a tiny fraction of oil production, right?
5829 2018-12-10 15:27:40 Sana oil
5830 2018-12-10 15:27:38 No doubt you're right about how people will react, because it's easier to feel attacked than to face reality.  But IMHO if we're truly listening to scientists there should be no expansion of the oil sands. Maybe proportional representation is the momentum we need & not pipelines.
5831 2018-12-10 15:27:32 So becoz Biti is allegedly a victim, he must defect to a nation which shoots & lynches its black citizens. The same nation built on killing 15mil AmerIndians, 1.2mil Arabs for oil, 5mil Congolese & benefits frm enslaving black people? Do you even think through the stuff you say?

5842 2018-12-10 15:26:40 Nakakaiyak yung shortage ng chicken oil sa mang inasal, we've been to 3 branches kasi ang lala ng cravings namin ni hiro for mang inasal. Thank god we found one na merong chicken oil

5844 2018-12-10 15:26:33 As a child of 13/14 with a view 4 #independent #Scotland  many yrs ago, Scottish oil was a big part of my argument( tho, not all of it)
Now I still fight  4 an
 #indyScotland, but oil is least of my argument id leave it in the ground. Scotland is much more than  our oil reserves
5845 2018-12-10 15:26:27 Lush has some amazing bath bombs and I always add a little apricot oil and lavender oil. Don’t forget the Epsom salt.
5846 2018-12-10 15:26:22 Alright here goes: depends on the recipe for simple roasting: olive oil, rosemary (fresh if possible), salt, and pepper. If I am judged, so be it.

5849 2018-12-10 15:25:51 You don't. Most of the oil and gas fields are foreign owned

5851 2018-12-10 15:25:46 A #Hanukkah quandary: why do we use candles that burn out so quickly? Between commemorating the miracle of the long-lasting oil and displaying our lights for the world, seems like we should be using something more like Shabbos or yahrzeit candles.

5853 2018-12-10 15:25:37 Russia would not want strong USA borders, strong employment, low taxes, strong military, increased NATO funding, USA oil independence.  Get real.  You’re living in a fantasy novel.
5854 2018-12-10 15:25:35 Not many people made the choice in the knowledge and acceptance of earthquakes.  Cuadrilla and others need to polish their techniques to reduce the impact.  Harder to do when oil price is trending down
5855 2018-12-10 15:25:33 Oil artists are fuming today!
5856 2018-12-10 15:25:31 There's no oil company at that table, and likely no denial of science. Actually, most of the people would likely put climate at the top of their list of concerns. What there is, is fear.
5857 2018-12-10 15:25:28 I'm more concerned about my province's oil and how we're going to get it to market how we're going to be able to use it ourselves. No point in exporting ours and using yours.

I'm due an oil change, and if I have some money left over after Friday I'll take it in and get that done and get them to check it all out. But right now, it runs, which is all I need.

5877 2018-12-10 15:24:24 Come to Alberta they have done a wonderful job. Our economy is best in Canada and considering how much oil money ALBERTANS give the rest of the country you might want to get off our tit before you start whining about having to care for the poor. #CrueltyIsAChoice #GodIsWatching

5881 2018-12-10 15:23:33 Does anybody else’s dad check the oil in your car every time you see him or is it just mine?
5882 2018-12-10 15:23:31 All black people have big portions so Dunno if it’s that I think our main issue is oil, salt and preparation methods e.g deep frying meat - maybe they have been abroad longer so the awareness to be more health conscious in the West is stronger than that back home? Just a guess.

5885 2018-12-10 15:23:18 All of the problems are Team Trudeau cancelling pipeline approvals,creating more red tape for approvals, and banning oil tankers carrying oil away from BC coast.

5887 2018-12-10 15:23:08 I'm tryna see if cbd oil would work for me, I don't ever see myself trying it recreationally, but a friend of mine had so much trouble and side affects from meds that I'm willing to give it a try. Tho idk if it's legal in GA. I hope it is.
5888 2018-12-10 15:22:57 So your saying JT gets to work each week and before doing the job of PM, orders up a tanker or 5 of Oil from Saudi Arabia just because he hates pipelines and oil from Alberta? Have you ever taken a basic economics course? Maybe buy the book Economics for Dummies.
5889 2018-12-10 15:22:57 I have their coconut mayo and avocado oil at home.
5890 2018-12-10 15:22:50 Interesting that in the same article promoting removing processed foods and industrial nutrition-less foods, the ads feature one such specific industrially-produced processed food: canola oil.

5892 2018-12-10 15:22:29 Oil sands bitumen would have to go through an upgraded to be suitable for eastern refineries. Or refineries would need to be refitted to process bitumen.
5893 2018-12-10 15:22:28 More eyes on Yemen war, oil prices have fluctuated because of Saudi threats, arms deals have fallen apart, US has bipartisan condemnation, opened inquiries into trump personal dealings with Saudis. Do your own researching you need more
5894 2018-12-10 15:22:15 Baloney. It's a total myth that modern pipelines pose any significant threat to the environment. You know of Lac Megantic?
That disaster was caused by shipping oil by train.
5895 2018-12-10 15:22:12 Sounds fair, maybe of BC would agree to pipelines to get Oil to international markets they would see prices drop.....but that is the price of unreasonable political interference in economics...
5896 2018-12-10 15:22:07 Yeah, funny you mention burns.  We have had record temps around the planet as fires spread due to climate change. Hillary took lots of money from the oil companies.  Bernie did not.  Look up New Green Deal.  Justice Democrats.  You will soon hear more about them.

5900 2018-12-10 15:21:53 For a long time it would seem that the US Auto Mfg. subscribed to planned obsolescence in the making, designing, materials used in the their vehicles, not to mention whatever deals made with big oil to keep up with Gas hogs of cars. I don't blame the workers for any of that.

5902 2018-12-10 15:21:48 Hahaha! Straight out of the Salmond crib sheet.  You are putting words into my mouth.  You really can't help yourself can you?  You've clearly learned nothing since 2014.  Oil is a volatile commodity.  It's price is entirely outwith our control.  You see no need for caution?
5903 2018-12-10 15:21:39 Nothing, to them.  They're protecting themselves from us.
5904 2018-12-10 15:21:29 ...who got worse or were injured or who went through withdrawal, nobody would take their medications. They basically need a near perfect alignment of the stars just to stay in business. Selling snake oil is a precarious profession and requires unquestioning faith to work.
5905 2018-12-10 15:21:21 Did you try coating the tray with a tiny amount of butter/oil to act as a releasing agent? Chocolate already has oil so it may not be improve any more with removal... but might reduce bubbles.

5911 2018-12-10 15:20:59 Name an issue.  Then look at Hillary's policy and Bernie's policy.  It's all online.  If you think supporting arms deals with the Saudis, corrupt bankers being against LGBT rights, and supporting oil companies is good, then fine.  I don't.  Hillary did.
5912 2018-12-10 15:20:50 Oil still headed towards 55-56? or?
5913 2018-12-10 15:20:49 Lonza in capsules made in Switzerland best (I use NOW Foods 500 mg caps.)
L-Carnitine should be taken empty stomach w/ fish oil gel. Hopefully cut out the sweets! I enjoy wine w/ dinner but keeping alcohol to 1 or 2 drinks per day best advice I've heard.
5914 2018-12-10 15:20:41 Funnily enough, invariably, they're on the left. But I am getting the sense, that many that say they're on the right wet the bed too much, and look more like Fabian plants. Don't you love it when politicians think being liked is more important than having character and substance?
5915 2018-12-10 15:20:41 Just scheduled my first oil change appointment, lmaoo. Big girl tingz

5919 2018-12-10 15:20:07 I saw a survey where nearly half of Americans identify " #electricity " as an #energy source, alongside #oil, nat #gas, #nuclear, etc. = Zero understanding that the latter produces the former. It would not be at all surprising if the Dem Caucus mirrored the public on this.
5920 2018-12-10 15:19:58 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
5921 2018-12-10 15:19:42 NEGATIVE. That's "Drunk chicken." For the crispiest chicken, the key is your oil, your oil temperature & what you dust chicken with. THAT'S ALL..!!! "BACK AWAY FROM THE ALCOHOL..!"
5922 2018-12-10 15:19:18 Luke 10:34 “He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine."

Ah, nothing will patch up a gunshot wound better than some oil and a little wine!
5923 2018-12-10 15:19:16 It isn't blackmail, it is a reality.  Alberta and Canada loses billions each day in royalties and equalization because of this situation, that did not exist even 5 years ago when the USA was a net importer of oil. Now, they are very much our competitor. We need access to coast.
5924 2018-12-10 15:19:14 With today’s technology, yes you do.
You also don’t need to burn as much coal, oil or gas when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. It’s no more complicated than that.

5926 2018-12-10 15:18:58 Harper’s legacy of failure continues to haunt Canada. Harper let Huawei into Canada despite warnings from CISI, he didn’t build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil and he didn’t have the balls to defund the CBC. His level of incompetence is hard to fathom.

5931 2018-12-10 15:18:33 Quebec - 0% social acceptability for CDN oil, but 100% social dependency on CDN oil revenue. That math doesn’t add up. #CanadianOil #cdnpoli
5932 2018-12-10 15:18:32 What do you think the difference is between taking a dab and vaporizing concentrate or oil?? Taking a dab is simply the term for vaporizing concentrate usually with a rig. Maybe you should’ve said dab or use a pen. Both are ways to vaporize wax. Never heard of dabbing flower??

5945 2018-12-10 15:17:23 The hidden reason why this is a bridge fuel is 2 fold. Shale Gas fields depleat  in >5 greater timeframes than ever harder to develop new Oil finds. Being on land and close to markets means the uplift costs are low. US defeated OPEC using it as lever circa 2015

5949 2018-12-10 15:16:54 They don't have enough oil off the east cost to fill their needs. They could use a million barrels a day from Alberta@amd Sask.Canadians need to support Canadians.
5950 2018-12-10 15:16:52 the thing that gets I wonder is whether Bush or Obama tweeted about the oil market would the market react the same? I always wonder whether Individual 1 really can do anymore than those before him?
5951 2018-12-10 15:16:41 Dollar is almost close to its high vs Rupee. Only luck is oil has tumbled big. Sensex at 34/35K is a big sell even if Urjit had stayed. Modi non existent vision on economic direction of India is taking its toll.
5952 2018-12-10 15:16:38 They need it. It's not easy living without oil.

5955 2018-12-10 15:16:07 I am cautious toward this because I'm not coming up with parallel studies that could be done around other disruptive breakthroughs. (electrical power, oil power, precision tooling, steam power, printing press, etc.)
5956 2018-12-10 15:16:07 Maybe Alberta could cite the cost of enduring the Feds restrictions for the movement of oil to markets as a tax - and deduct it from the other taxes AB and Albertans pay to the Feds?
5957 2018-12-10 15:15:55

It's an oil, so a light alcohol will solve it.

5964 2018-12-10 15:15:21 And we could/would if the like of Quebec would allow us access for transport of the product they get payments from. U know how much more they pay to import oil from other countries? It’s at least double what AB gets for its oil. Make sense?

5975 2018-12-10 15:14:31 I boycott anything that includes or uses palm oil. 

Just read an article that said Indonesia is worried that Norway has banned palm oil as a biofuel and that this may set a precedent for other countries.
5976 2018-12-10 15:14:29 Just for you lovely folks this actually might happen to..  oil fire need to be put out with flour, not water.  Water will spread the fire.  

Oh and... bigger pot, only filled 1/3rd to 1/2 with oil.  It expands when hit with anything wet.

You're welcome.
5977 2018-12-10 15:14:28 im sorry its against the law to be depressed under the ownership of an essential oil diffuser, the police are on their way :/
5978 2018-12-10 15:14:26 No worries, just steam them 4 min if frozen. If you put olive oil on it they’ll eat it. Happy Holidays
5979 2018-12-10 15:14:17 We need more refineries on the east coast to refine our offshore oil.
5980 2018-12-10 15:14:09 what exactly is wrong with your nipples now?? you’ll be able to breastfeed love. the first few days even a week is the hardest! lots of coconut oil or nipple cream, and make sure you sand which your whole boob and shove it into her mouth
5981 2018-12-10 15:14:05 Aye ... the only country cursed with oil 
5982 2018-12-10 15:14:05 Recognize that 50 years of pumping oil gave Norway a $1.1 trillion sovereignty fund because Norway put oil revenue aside while setting taxes to roughly equal costs while Alberta used oil revenues to subsidize costs and buy votes.

5988 2018-12-10 15:13:40 Well here's a plan, why don't we remove the nuclear weapons from the Clyde and tap into Scotlands largest and easiest to access oil reserves?

5993 2018-12-10 15:13:24 I’d say the oil tanker ran on to 2008 under the old regime. A comparison of 98-08 to 09-19 will demonstrate any differences.
5994 2018-12-10 15:13:24 What sanctions were dropped? I watched the price of oil drop, which is very bad for russia.
5995 2018-12-10 15:13:21 Yes, it's costly for Alberta to extract oil and yes, if we were to stop importing, gas prices would be affected.

6011 2018-12-10 15:12:09 Cannibis oil isn't a drug. It's the same as rubbing lavender essential oils on their forehead. The legality of it is shaky though because of the fact that many misinformed people lump it together with smoking it.

6014 2018-12-10 15:11:59 Okay but the problem is he enacted the gas tax to start tryin to move them towards a non carbon based economy, and the oil companies literally run our country and have convinced the entire population that moving towards sustainable energy is a liberal elitist concept

6026 2018-12-10 15:10:59 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
6027 2018-12-10 15:10:58 So why now? IMO its because of the described opportunity and for a lack of options. Putins ratings are really low (victory in Syria did not help him much at all) AND his economy is in for a hard landing. Oil is low again & the reserves he used to stay afloat are almost depleted
6028 2018-12-10 15:10:58 違う意味で号泣だった。。
6029 2018-12-10 15:10:57 It was never going to last forever.

Oil is finite resource.

And yes, it is blackmail. "Validate us or we separate. Validate us or we'll never vote Liberal again. Validate us or..."

Thing is, we've all seen this song and dance before when QC was doing it.

The act is old.

6036 2018-12-10 15:10:25 Is there an essential oil to erase the memory of yesterday's Patriots game? Asking for a friend.
6037 2018-12-10 15:10:21 Mexico also signals with a new 8 billion dollar oil refinery, for as much as things change , some remain the same
6038 2018-12-10 15:10:19 In today’s moment of stupidity starring me - I convinced myself that the mileage number on my oil change sticker in my car was the last mileage my car was at when my oil was changed.

6046 2018-12-10 15:09:55 So that's why he wants the oil money, to finance the costs of maintaining this arrangement?
6047 2018-12-10 15:09:52 East coast should get their oil from the east coast. That's my opinion.
6048 2018-12-10 15:09:52 うわああああああ( ˊ•̥  ̯ •̥`)
6049 2018-12-10 15:09:47 And Justin Trudeau doesn’t import oil from the saudis. “Canada” doesn’t import oil from the saudis. Ironically, some people who fund Sheers campaign do though.

6051 2018-12-10 15:09:22 I think real developers would probably find a location more profitable than Russia after the sanctions. I heard a commentator call Saudi Arabia a 3rd world country with oil. Russia is the same basically. They’re not that powerful economically

6053 2018-12-10 15:09:18 Its a 5 year old child with autism. The difference between weed and cannabis oil is not something i will pretend to know about so more information on that would be appreciated. But Austism is not a disease, It is not something that can be cured.
6054 2018-12-10 15:09:17 What's the alternative? Coconut oil, Shea butter? I bet they are more expensive than palm oil and manufacturers wont switch.
6055 2018-12-10 15:09:14 His clientele need to be educated that they are nowhere near as green as they like to think they are. I would guess most are oblivious to the oil tankers they host every day and, if anything, they should be aware of the oil trains. Both are far more likely to fail than a pipeline

6058 2018-12-10 15:09:05 Because it costs less to import than to deal with the extraction/shipping/refining cost of our own oil.
Businesses exist to make a profit, not to make us feel all hunky dory about life.

6061 2018-12-10 15:08:41 We more than make up the little bit extra carbon intensivity with our strict environmental laws. Consider this. Our east coast oil comes from the Saudis who treat women like dirt and Venezuela a country that is destroying itself environmentally and politically.
6062 2018-12-10 15:08:34 My boss asked me if i have time to get his truck a oil change and wash....of course...
6063 2018-12-10 15:08:27 Moisture is key.Have a spray bottle mix leave in conditioner, your favourite oils (mine used to be coconut oil and palm kernel)nd warm water found out it works better for me then seal in moisture with a heavy butter or oil just on your ends sleeping with a satin bonnet helps too

6071 2018-12-10 15:07:45 there's a difference between weed and cannabis oil, and to some extent cannabis oil *can* help. It's not about them using cannabis oil as treatment being deemed as wrong/inhumane, it's about the fact that it's illegal where they live.
6072 2018-12-10 15:07:42 @LindseyGrahamSC you said if it wasn’t for USA Saudi Arabia would be speaking Farsi. Okay, first you have to show why. Second, how did it feel when King Faisal closed the tap of oil? USA depression. Now, you are a mouthpiece and we know it, you are chasing mirage.
6073 2018-12-10 15:07:42 Good? Am I supposed to be alarmed or feel bad for all the poor billionaire oil tycoons?

6075 2018-12-10 15:07:17 It's a combination of factors. The running 24/7 has caused the wheels to be destroyed to the point they're unusable, with grooves worn in them from the rails, and new and inaccurate wheels were made. This running is also why the engines are covered top to bottom in oil. (1/2)

6077 2018-12-10 15:07:10 @RubinReport, over the weekend I :
Put up outdoor Christmas lights
Changed the oil in my car
Drained sediment from the water heater
And on Sunday, visited my Dad.

Twitter (etc.) is not real life :)

Hope you had a good weekend as well.

6095 2018-12-10 15:05:22 The subject is the oil market. Still important to their economy.
6096 2018-12-10 15:05:09 Why should a party that could not provide steady water and electricity in an oil producing country for 16 years of their leadership campaigning   to come back next year. What exactly are they desperate for?

6099 2018-12-10 15:05:06 For real: this Hanukkah I ran out of oil making latkes but the oil in the pan lasted just long enough to finish the last batch!

6116 2018-12-10 15:02:55 You’re conveniently forgetting that times and situations have changed. We were in a better position before the US shale oil explosion. We got good money for our product. Tidewater was less of a concern. Cons saw ther change coming and then started to adapt to the climate by

6126 2018-12-10 15:02:18 It could start by linking oil and gas infrastructure with  equalization. Instead of fiscal capacity how about pipeline capacity
6127 2018-12-10 15:02:16 It’s private industry (Irving) which chooses to buy (cheap) oil from SA, not the govt. Cons said nothing about SA imports when in power, just sweetened arms deals with them. But in reality Quebec also imports oil & gas from US & AB.

6165 2018-12-10 14:59:47 I use drive thru oil change areas because my car is an embarrassing mess. At least I’m getting it changed though 
6166 2018-12-10 14:59:45 I agree on the specifics, but in theory if there were a substantial reduction in the global supply of oil, that would cause increased demand for Canadian oil, increasing the price.

6175 2018-12-10 14:58:58 What's happening with WCS is even crazier. Cdn heavy oil names plunge because of the differential, & then the differential narrows, yet they continue plunging. U could have Coke announce that Diet Coke sales are slipping, and heavy oil names would probably sink on that news too.
6176 2018-12-10 14:58:53 I look more and more today at the items I buy. Especially the more information I am exposed to. IE after the recent Ice Land advert in relation to palm oil and the orangutang   I no longer buy products containing palm oil.

6205 2018-12-10 14:56:45 But the big thing here is that some people are making a lot of money on oil.  Really, isn't that more important than the health of our air, land and water?
6206 2018-12-10 14:56:30 No solo eso, desde lo técnico tambien debería bajar, y asimismo si el oil no vuelve a subir desde los fundamentos tambien debería bajar. Es mi humilde visión.
6207 2018-12-10 14:56:28 For sure, yet our dependence on SA oil has finally been weakened; if not eliminated. And that’s one more “Up yours , Barry” moment.
6208 2018-12-10 14:56:15 Thank you :) and I meant gingelly oil. Autocorrect aaargh!
6209 2018-12-10 14:56:13 Why wouldn't they deny it?  When the world weens itself from the petroleum teet and begin to use renewable energy main stream  their most valuable exported commodity will loose much of it's value.  Prices of oil will plummet.  Their denial is an attempt to stop this.

6220 2018-12-10 14:55:14 Thankfully Home Depot let us exchange it. The $30.00 loss in drained oil and fuel plus driving 80 miles there and back. Second one exchanged sat in box inside home until two weeks ago. I pulled 3-5 times with choke until it almost starts, then pulled 1 time and yippee, it started

6224 2018-12-10 14:54:51 1/2: We are building a huge 900MW 100% gas fired power plant at Napanee adjacent to the Lennox dual oil and gas fired plant owned by OPG. The only reason I can see for building it is to replace some of the output from Pickering nuclear station when it closes.
6225 2018-12-10 14:54:40 The PM owns Irving Oil, does he?  I did not know that
6226 2018-12-10 14:54:39 PURCHASED 04/12/18.......1000-011-532.......INVOICE 6132384. Purchased pre mixed fuel 50:1 at $24.95, plus bar oil $5.99 and respirator mask $24.99. WOULD NOT START, with or without the choke and with time to allow flooded carb to clear.

6228 2018-12-10 14:54:11 Shut up UK! Your hands are dirty. Your governments extern policy is still supporting forces who are violating human rights only and only to get oil. Recent example: your support on PMF in Kerkuk province against Kurds. Many Kurds still can’t return home. #HumanRightsDay
6229 2018-12-10 14:54:02 The status of water wells and the status of oil fields reflect the bitter reality... Whatever some people do to hide it looks like a #ليبيا failed state and government...

6231 2018-12-10 14:54:00 I wanna know how you lot make mac + cheese. Just to test the waters and see what everyone else is doing. I personally like it cheesy, to be *firm* and not swimming in oil/cheese, rather mixed well and established in cheese.

6234 2018-12-10 14:53:50 Divesting ourselves of oil, R&D in renewable energy, cancelling pipelines is the scope of leadership Canadians expected this government. It is bold, responsible and necessary.
6235 2018-12-10 14:53:40 ....We cannot verify internationally sourced food safety. Additionally, there are horrible labor and environmental standards. Palm oil is an example. We haven’t bought processed junk in 10 years.
6236 2018-12-10 14:53:37 Great question- if Donald Trump thinks climate change is a hoax, why are these men in suits promoting carbon capture and storage? Fiery debate on oil and gas w people who don’t think we should keep anything in the ground @healthy_climate @TheAusInstitute @IRENA
6237 2018-12-10 14:53:30 This is one point on which we *may* differ: I don't think the US acts to devalue $ against gold until the international markets have already forced its hand by reintroducing gold into the trade settlement equation at a much higher gold/oil ratio. But perhaps that's what you mean.
6238 2018-12-10 14:53:25 Why does Scotland let half-educated old Etonian English run our country?
Because their craving for oil & gas & world-leading food & drink revenues balances their suspect economy?

6239 2018-12-10 14:53:20 We can win the War on Terror without going overseas to do it. Indeed, we may very well be fighting over there to enrich oil interests and sacrificing our young men and women for money instead of freedom.
6240 2018-12-10 14:53:18 Yeah. But I still save on labor. Not much but at least I know I did it right and I’m using the oil/filter I want. I’ve heard horror stories with some of those oil change places.

6296 2018-12-10 14:48:17 In retrospect. Look at the time table when our provincial spending almost doubled. 2003-2015. There lies the people who used the oil wealth to spend their way to re-election multiple times. While most people cheered and thought we were a have province.

6302 2018-12-10 14:47:52 No sir. We probably agree that real and sustainable progress can only come through reforms. I also believe that the current administration is doing more with less, albeit with oil rents. These opinions are not mutually exclusive.

6304 2018-12-10 14:47:51 The proper approach is to remove the largest emitters first. Those are coal, oil and gas fired power plants. Once the power system is carbon free THEN tackle transportation...otherwise it is a waste of time and will increase emissions. We still have gas fired plants in Ontario

6349 2018-12-10 14:43:34 It’s not the production of wells and extracting oil that causes the majority of CO2 released in atmosphere which some people hypothesize is the control knob for the Climate. It is the burning of the oil in the form of electricity generation, heating home, driving car.

6358 2018-12-10 14:42:09 This morning, a commercial popped up on the pump at the gas station advertising an Instagram account called “What’s Trending.” They said penguin sweaters are popular right now because they are cute and protect penguins from oil spills. This dystopia we’re living is really strange
6359 2018-12-10 14:42:03 Did you know that Olive Oyl from the show “Popeye” was named after Olive Oil? Must have slipped your mind.
6360 2018-12-10 14:42:02 I love coconut. I love food cooked in coconut oil (chips, Avial etc). But this combination I am not sure of 
6361 2018-12-10 14:41:59 美少女が凄い勢いで俺を外に連れ出してくれるのが良いね
6362 2018-12-10 14:41:43 It’s been warm enough and humid enough in my house this week that my coconut oil has completely liquefied, and my Milo has turned into asbestos.
6363 2018-12-10 14:41:31 5555555555
6364 2018-12-10 14:41:16 I just checked my oil at 630 am since i didn’t do it yesterday at 330 
6365 2018-12-10 14:41:14 It wasn't the promise of a Trump Tower in Moscow Trump was after. It was a cut of the oil after sanctions were dropped. Follow the oil. Rex Tillerson forgot his part. That's why Trump hated him.
6366 2018-12-10 14:41:13 Apple is down, oil is down, how do I buy #stock cause this would be the time.
6367 2018-12-10 14:41:12 Noooo ...  Not Nutella, it has buckets of palm oil in it!    
6368 2018-12-10 14:41:09 Trump’s commitment to climate change denialism and to oil & coal are treated like side-effects of his ignorance, selfishness, & Fox-news-broken-brain. Idea that they’re central to the plot seems like an interesting season finale twist. Great work in the writer's room.
6369 2018-12-10 14:40:54 City is funded by Sugar Daddy (or Oil daddy).... It does not matter to them..

6372 2018-12-10 14:40:26 Kalo buat ngecilin pori nggatau juga,  mungkin laneige pore(?) kalo innisfree kurang ngaruh menurutku. Ngalusin kulit pake face oil,  ntah itu rice bran/ jojoba keknya bakal works juga dikamu
6373 2018-12-10 14:40:19 Yeah, following the money isn't exactly a new concept. I posted his oil & gas donations ($113k).

6376 2018-12-10 14:40:10 I’m tired but I need an oil change 
6377 2018-12-10 14:40:07 Endless oil story

6379 2018-12-10 14:39:54 If I know oil companies, we can definitely trust them to obey the law and do the right thing for the environment.
6380 2018-12-10 14:39:53 Weird there going out of business 
6381 2018-12-10 14:39:50 "he" does not import any oil. Governments do not import oil, companies do. You stoking the flames of division by telling outright lies is dangerous.
6382 2018-12-10 14:39:47 I just don’t understand whyyyyy it take so long to do a oil change when I come here 
6383 2018-12-10 14:39:42 It’s the oil producers protecting their investment. Or should I say their power. Without oil $$ Russia  and Saudi become 3rd rate countries.
6384 2018-12-10 14:39:28 Is it a coincidence that the optics show America’s silent acquiescence to Khashoggi’s murder to coincide with a decrease in the price of oil?
6385 2018-12-10 14:39:02 No thanks to socialism. 
Confiscate the oil and put it into the hands of community organizers who run government. Give stolen riches to people who have little money starting in government and leave as millionaires. 
Not a good solution.
6386 2018-12-10 14:38:56 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot

6389 2018-12-10 14:38:42 Africa is doing OK when we aren't interfering with it trying to force them to let us build oil pipelines into their country
6390 2018-12-10 14:38:39 Coconut oil is becoming my jam. Love that it is safe to use on fur babies and if they lick it off not going to do much because it’s safe to digest. Perk you can even add to their diet and it help internally as well. 
6391 2018-12-10 14:38:29 Leave the smocking gun, take the canola oil!

6398 2018-12-10 14:37:49 "Oil's importance as a resource had been identified by Britain as early as 1918 - as essential to national survival in any future war, and the security of oil supply determined much British policy in the Middle East."
6399 2018-12-10 14:37:43 Because they got caught bullshitting and people have had enough of it. The crisps are tawdry quality since the change of oil type anyway and the pack weights are pathetic too.
6400 2018-12-10 14:37:36 every major brand sold in the US uses broth if it says "canned in water" including some of the fancier brands. I have friends with nightshade allergies and celery allergies. They both typically can't use anything in broth that is mass produced. Unfortunately neither like in oil.
6401 2018-12-10 14:37:32 Wait. We pronounce jia you = "add oil"?

6405 2018-12-10 14:37:25 These are NOT the utterances of a president, especially one leading the 'world's greatest democracy'. They are what you might expect from a former used car salesman trying to keep his snake oil business alive by selling sub-prime mortgages on 'beach-front' swamp plots in Florida.
6406 2018-12-10 14:37:25 Well, maybe sanctions at least. Judging by the demand for their oil, they need the US more than the US needs them. The Saudi regime has gotten a pass for too long.
6407 2018-12-10 14:37:16 No oil...
6408 2018-12-10 14:37:05 Not surprising that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Russia are oil producing countries.
6409 2018-12-10 14:37:01 Brothers selling this snake oil of sex equals marriage and makes a woman a wife are truly making sisters their concubines..which Hebraic is a type of wife..but not on the level that you're making sisters feel they're going to be on
6410 2018-12-10 14:36:57 Gotta go get my oil leak fixed ugh.
6411 2018-12-10 14:36:49 There's something of the oil painting about this. #painterlyphoto
6412 2018-12-10 14:36:32 Yes most do recommend fish oil. When do you take yours? Bad part for me, I get severe heartburn, I’ve tried cutting dose & taking multiple times during day- but continue to get the heartburn despite it 
6413 2018-12-10 14:36:29 Easterners have no say at all in where private companies buy their crude oil supplies.
6414 2018-12-10 14:36:28 Ahh..I don’t believe him. He couldn’t concentrate long enough to read a serious book. Wouldn’t the big words stump him? That whole interview is a joke. With the oil crisis we are having,why would he say he reads an anti oil book? Really! What a goof.
6415 2018-12-10 14:36:27 Oil changed

6426 2018-12-10 14:35:11 can you believe frankie muniz, my first celebrity crush, owns an olive oil company now
6427 2018-12-10 14:35:08 Nice, like a glass of warm vodka with a couple melty slivers of ice and some oil floating on top?
6428 2018-12-10 14:35:04 A very simple solution. Ship Canadian oil out of Churchill Manitoba directly to refineries in New Brunswick and elsewhere. All that's needed is a new federal government. This one isn't working for Canadians.

6447 2018-12-10 14:33:46 this is Turkish, are you actually from Turkey?  I don´t think among Turkish processed food manufacturers there is much of an awareness abt the problems with using palm oil shortening or other derivatives.  I deal with some of these manufacturers.
6448 2018-12-10 14:33:38 At #SIF18 listening about assets at risk of becoming stranded if they depend on oil, as climate might render them worthless prior to the end of their economic life time. Investment is needed for transitioning those assets. #EarthDay2020 can be a milestone for commitments.
6449 2018-12-10 14:33:38 The notion that Putin spent years studying climate change and his takeaway was that it would benefit Russia because Russia would be warmer & it would open up oil drilling in the artic is just…I mean, that would be some grade A supervillainry. Meanwhile,

6508 2018-12-10 14:28:22 I don’t think she’s the darling of the oil patch - unfortunately when you consider the likely alternative is conservative with no real strategy, vision and a scary ideology.
6509 2018-12-10 14:28:20 Shur I do give it a gentle bath in oil on the frying pan as well and I’ll tell ya, everyone enjoys that
6510 2018-12-10 14:28:16 Back then we smoked cigarettes and cigars at sea, the boat would get yellow stained inside the ventilation system so it smelled a bit like an ashtray.  125 stinky men that don't shower much, lube oil, fuel for the emergency diesel combined for a smell all submariners recognize.
6511 2018-12-10 14:28:13 and her whole "libya's oil are belong to us" thing. but the lying about rolling her eyes at cornell west fiasco and when she forged an email on notepad to prove she never worked on well fare reform kinda belie her moments of insanely out-of-touch truth-telling
6512 2018-12-10 14:28:12 Very important... Those garlic mixed with sardine oil smell nuh mek sense. 

Even guys too need to smell themselves... Nobody is left out!
6513 2018-12-10 14:28:06 Who is prepared for another crash in 2025? That's my bet because oil and gas will be involved.
6514 2018-12-10 14:28:01 china will be fucked, canada can stop sending coal and oil there and a whole lot more like no more lumber

6516 2018-12-10 14:27:54 Wow, a government that actually cares about the oil industry and prepared to do something about it..... if only...
6517 2018-12-10 14:27:44 Brian, what kind of ills are you talking about? I know this might sound weird, but I use THC oil for insomnia. I don’t use it for pain because i don’t have any, I use it for sleep. But, after taking the oil drops at night, I experience pain and achiness until I fall asleep. ??

6521 2018-12-10 14:27:29 I am willing to make a bet this morning...that a certain report wasn't created by long and deep searches for information, but instead a mass of information was "handed over and provided" by a type of...whistleblowing...from a person who was sick of the endless muck and snake oil
6522 2018-12-10 14:27:25 You can't follow! Please don't forget the millions of us over here who are proud of our status as UK and EU citizens - and desperate to retain both. And don't ever give in to that bunch of lying, deceiving, snake oil salesmen masquerading as the UK's "Dear Leaders".

6541 2018-12-10 14:25:44 Perhaps what people are expressing is that there is little to no social acceptance for equalization in Alberta, much like there is no social acceptance in Quebec for oil.

6562 2018-12-10 14:24:05 Dr. Naim, you are right. Rusia will invest first to develop their own resources. The return of the investment in the oil business in Venezuela, does not rank for Rusia as a priority; high investment & costs to bring extra heavy crude to a commercial quality, and to which market.

6565 2018-12-10 14:23:51 @realDonaldTrump as a follow up dropping oil prices means the loss of jobs in the industry. Thousands of jobs across the board which affects not only the oil industry but businesses such as hotels, restaurants, airlines and the like. A few pennies at the pump sustain many jobs.

However, I believe your stance on the price of oil goes against your dedication to job creation. The price per barrel MUST stay in the $60 to $70 range for viability.

6694 2018-12-10 14:11:31 Thank you. Might resource assessments like this, and/or exaggerations of future production levels (EIA) give speculators cause to drive down the price of oil, or keep oil prices low, and if so then might we say those sorts of things from the government are politically motivated?

6920 2018-12-10 13:51:30 India has not been properly explored for oil and gas. Another fact, we have 200 years of coal reserves but also import 200 million tons of coal, paying almost $20b every year. Utter failure of our oil and mining policies.
6921 2018-12-10 13:51:29 Just because Obama has better etiquette and a smooth talker that sold his snake oil better. His policies aligned more with socialism that as you can see in France doesn’t work.

And to imagine some of these guys might be running canteens and pepper soup joints. Ahhhhh

And I thought using sweeping brooms to cook was the lowest I will see in my lifetime.
6939 2018-12-10 13:49:16 Id like to know how much oil we have hedged and at what areas in price and length.

6941 2018-12-10 13:49:12 Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will announce a plan to increase oil production next Saturday during a trip to the southeastern state of Campeche.

6942 2018-12-10 13:49:02 .@lopezobrador_ says he will present a plan to boost Mexico's oil production next Saturday during a trip to Campeche
6943 2018-12-10 13:49:01 (gas prices everywhere else SOARED, because...Texas wasn't producing any oil because there was no way to do so economically.)

6945 2018-12-10 13:48:42 side note, I really wish all these deregulation economists paid attention to history and stuff like the Texas wildcat oil days, in which the oil price crashed so hard in Texas that it was impossible to make money off oil, because nothing was regulated at all
6946 2018-12-10 13:48:39 I knew Global Warming was a lie when I heard the "solution" was the same old, tax, regulate & spend redistribution scheme liberals always propose. 
What has Mr Steyer DONE to live by his own agenda? 
Don't you have another railroad to buy, to transport oil?

There will have been huge amounts of midnight oil burnt to get  things up and running last week....and the "aftershocks" will still be causing issues.

7001 2018-12-10 13:44:06 If they didn't have oil they would still be a backward state and getting around on camels & planes with 2 props

The Saudi oil is refined in Irving plants, and sold to the consumer.

Anything else?

7022 2018-12-10 13:40:58 If I were a rich, sparsely populated country that depended on my reserves of oil, I'd probably not mention that around the Americans.
7023 2018-12-10 13:40:57 yep, the US does not want us to sell oil to other countries as they can force our price down further. I bet many pipeline protesters are funded by the US.
7024 2018-12-10 13:40:55 Why should they get jobs? The oil wealth should benefit everyone. Do the elite have jobs?

7034 2018-12-10 13:39:56 The government doesn’t import Saudi oil, the Irvings do. Because they make more profit refining Saudi oil than they would Canadian oil. And they donate enough to both parties to ensure they will be able to continue to profit on Saudi oil.

7039 2018-12-10 13:39:26 As long as they have oil. Sometimes I think, their allies are waiting more than anyone else for their oil to run dry.
7040 2018-12-10 13:39:12 Never thought I'd say this... But sometimes I wish Balrogs were real so the oil companies would understand the danger of digging too greedily and too deep.
7041 2018-12-10 13:39:09 The price is “cheap oil” around the world.
7042 2018-12-10 13:39:08 Oh a whole table spoon of olive oil.

7047 2018-12-10 13:38:58 What folks don't understand this pipeline (never mind it already leaks) is going to be placed in the river at points, where millions of folks get their water.  You can't drink oil.  The bastardization of native land needs to stop! We don't NEED Canadian oil, we have other choices

7054 2018-12-10 13:37:51 Not really. We fought Trudeau and the NEP 50 years ago for the right to compete and sell our oil on the “free market”. Trudeau can’t place sanctions on Saudi oil without OPEC acting similarly against us.
7055 2018-12-10 13:37:37 "Follow This," is a Dutch group that accumulates shares in oil companies in order to press them over greenhouse gases, has already moved a number of climate shareholder resolutions at Royal Dutch Shell & may also target Chevron & Exxon Mobil.

7071 2018-12-10 13:35:57 While I am not saying oil spills are ok - you do realize the Kamloops spill was only 30 barrels?? 5000 litres makes it sound so much more newsworthy doesn’t it...  is that the best you can come up with??? And thousands of jobs in B.C., Alberta and elsewhere should be scuttled?
7072 2018-12-10 13:35:53 Pressure on oil companies is building after an activist group filed a shareholder resolution urging BP to set hard targets for reducing overall carbon emissions.

7078 2018-12-10 13:35:26 Putin, MBS and Trump are trying to corner the world's oil market to create a New World Order. They would control 66% of the world's oil with OPEC.

7091 2018-12-10 13:33:56 Put oil rigger patches, numbers, 40th anniversary logo..whatever on the sea of shoulder orange, maybe I'd consider getting one.  Never liked this color combo and only owned the white in the pre-multi jersey days.  Reverse it with orange as main color, I like.
7092 2018-12-10 13:33:56 And when Jesus was in BETHANY at the house of Simon THE LEPER, a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil, and she POURED it ON His HEAD as He sat at  the  table.

7094 2018-12-10 13:33:45 The common thread? Oil and gas interests have huge sway over policy. Russia and Saudi Arabia are Petrostates, and the US has oil companies and oil barons.

7101 2018-12-10 13:32:50 What may be a larger cause for concern is that both short and long term inflation expectations also fell back to the lows seen this year. Despite oil prices rallying 3% on Friday after the OPEC+ agreement on oil production cuts, US inflation breakeven rates also failed to rise.

7114 2018-12-10 13:31:26 They both serve the same purpose, balm just adds more control than oil - it helps keep the beard tamed so you can style it. I’d recommend using it sparingly (if you choose to) cos it’s thicker & can pull out hairs when too much of it is applied - hope that helped bro

7120 2018-12-10 13:30:44 Investors remained cautious ahead of the outcome of state assembly  elections and UK Parliament's vote on Brexit. However, Exporters' Dollar  sales coupled with fall in crude oil prices supported the sentiment. The Rupee ended at 71.34 vs. previous close of 70.81.

7163 2018-12-10 13:26:32 jojoba oil is technically liquid wax, so putting it on & around your fingernails seals them from damage/dryness. 

it’s also completely odorless and absorbs almost immediately. doesn’t feel greasy in the slightest.

7181 2018-12-10 13:23:56 Saudi oil is irrelevant to US now. Weapons, yes they are the largest customer of US arms. But they can't switch supplier even if they tried. It will take a couple of decades for them to do that, if they tried. But the regime will fall the moment US takes it's hands off.
7182 2018-12-10 13:23:55 As an academic reading respected news sources, I’m left wondering why the dissemination of knowledge has to be so profitable.

7231 2018-12-10 13:18:50 It’s only dirty so far because of the lies about Kamala last year and Beto recently  and these lies are only being perpetuated by ONE candidates spokespeople. It’s not like the Kirsten people are running around twitter calling Kamala a cop, or Beto beholden to the oil industry.
7232 2018-12-10 13:18:47 Libya was a brutal dictatorship, with no democracy and propped up purely on the back of oil. It was hardly socialist disparities of wealth were vast

7263 2018-12-10 13:15:42 Oil fell on Monday, in line with further declines in global stock  markets, erasing the gains made last week when producer group OPEC and  other key exporters agreed to cut their crude output from January.

7283 2018-12-10 13:13:59 you are right.  Recently I too saw a presentation in Europe where an eminent speaker said it requires 50,000 liters of water to process 1kg of Beef from start to end.  So the next war will be for water and not oil. He requested everyone to try to become vegans to save our planet
7284 2018-12-10 13:13:36 Russia is heavily dependent on oil and gas markets. They are a major supplier.
7285 2018-12-10 13:13:35 First the good news : GHG from the power sector in France will be in 2018 significantly below 17 and 16 while exporting an extra 20+TWh.
Emissions should be above 2014 which was record low and just below 2015 which was quite low. Record low production from coal+oil (8TWh)

7360 2018-12-10 13:06:26 @RandPaul @RepThomasMassie no amount of oil or business with the Saudis can allow this to occur unless you want Pandora’s box opened - if you guys have guts, subpoenas should be issued for all electronic msg’s between Kushner and MDS, who should be persona non-grata in the US

7362 2018-12-10 13:06:16 Given our gift-from-God (oil), the Liberal/NDP actions that steer to go a greener route, at this point in time, is so wrong, on so many levels. The US and the Middle East flourish developing their oil while we face certain economic disaster ... lt's ludicrous/irresponsible/sad!

7389 2018-12-10 13:04:27 You would probably be best with a 1000mg oil, start off taking 1/4 of the dropper and graudally build up to 1/3 after a couple days if needed.
7390 2018-12-10 13:04:25 I'd say it pretty much guarantees he gets in. What I'm curious to see is if some voters take this as a chance to re-examine a guy like Walker while he's still on the ballot. Still can't believe Baines got in ahead of contemporaries Murphy, Whitaker, Hernandez etc...

7399 2018-12-10 13:03:09 yeah, what i'm saying that isn't going to change with US stopping support for Saudi war crimes and such. They will continue to sell their oil regardless.

7424 2018-12-10 13:00:31 Pro tip: Cats hate orange scented anything. To deter them from the Christmas tree, try spraying diluted orange essential oil in distilled water (10-20 drops per 1 ounce of water), shake well and spray onto the tree. Can also leave Orange peelings around the base. They'll hate it.

But, they're upset because we invaded them, so guerrilla warfare. We're the invaders, so we call it terrorism, though. We could end it by withdrawing troops.

7431 2018-12-10 12:59:39 You don't have to worry that Saudi will stop selling oil  they aren't doing it for US benefit, but for their own benefit.

7450 2018-12-10 12:58:07 The biofuel promoted by this company is Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil and worldwide, most of that contains #palmoil.  Introducing such biofuels into shipping will inevitably lead to more palm oil expansion. The small amounts of used cooking oil are a distraction.

7640 2018-12-10 12:39:01 Once upon a time, Nigeria had an economy whose mainstay was agriculture. The exportation of cocoa, rubber, kola, and the likes was the major source of income for the nation until the oil boom.

7642 2018-12-10 12:38:58 Why does it take the dealership like 6 hours to change your oil. Why do I have synthetic oil in my stupid car. Why is so expensive. And why is the dealership the only one to give me discounts so I feel obligated to come here and save legit $30+.
7643 2018-12-10 12:38:56 It's not even about the environment, it's about raising taxes. If he cared about the environment he'd ban oil based fuels overnight.

7648 2018-12-10 12:38:21 We should definitely not depend on their oil, but that said I think it's important that we work with allies there in pursuit of our main goals, which are obviously stopping Iranian influence and terror from spreading. Difference between depend and work with, IMO
7649 2018-12-10 12:38:20 If Canadian workers were made the priority, we'd be building projects in Canada to ship oil instead of getting oil from Saudi Arabia.

7658 2018-12-10 12:37:34 The oil industry (and ideally also the DoD ) must be mostly dismantled & repurposed to fight climate change. The sooner we realize this, the better—climate facts don't care about our feelings.

7770 2018-12-10 12:23:25 Correct Nathan. When I gained the keys to this new house. Ripped out the indirect copper cylinder, moved the new thermal store into my loft directly over the structure of the airing cupboard. I then replumbed the gas boiler flow and return direct to the new vented thermal store

7811 2018-12-10 12:19:13 The healthcare tech space is pure shit. Due to regulations, the cost of entry is too high, so only giants can compete. This leads to monopolization, but not the kind little people benefit from (Amazon, Microsoft, Std Oil). Instead, everything gets more inefficient and costly.

It's not really greediness cos they are trying to find a way to survive,if the economy was better then it could be referred to as greediness

7860 2018-12-10 12:11:43 I wouldn’t say it outweighs the negative effects. I would say it’s a great result for a less than desirable necessity. The fact is, we need the oil sands right now. Clean energy needs to be transitioned into and the oil sands will help pay for that trasnsition.

This is mere wickedness, greediness at it finest. 
These people are scoping the oil to sell to the gullible people who doesn't know the source. This is not the fault of the government in anyway, it's greediness.
7905 2018-12-10 12:04:34 Just terrible to think some people in this world can do that to another human being. Hurts my heart. Yet no one sanctions them because they have oil.
7906 2018-12-10 12:04:31 Because it was a blatant lie. Government doesn’t import oil.

7915 2018-12-10 12:03:02 Restoration also taught Campos to strive for an "overall reality" and to subdue his brushwork. Although his art relies on photography, Campos goes beyond the photographic to create a distinctive oil on canvas aesthetic that is his alone.

7924 2018-12-10 12:01:00 If 40% of US oil imports come from Canada - a drop in France shouldn’t affect US pricing by a lot.  If it does - then you know pricing is arbitrary & preset by a select group of greedy people rather than actual market conditions

7962 2018-12-10 11:55:10 You’re mistaken. The gemora says Chanukah is a celebration only of the oil miracle. Doesn’t mention the war. Al hanisim is a prose thanking Hashem for miraculously saving us. And even there it doesn’t mention smithing about sovereignty, only saved lives.

7970 2018-12-10 11:52:53 I use sunflower in everything but any light coloured oil will do. Anything too dark tends to carry a heavier flavour (there's probably an exception that I can't think of) so rapeseed would do, sunflower, standard vegetable, etc would be fine
7971 2018-12-10 11:52:24 4/ Yes, they are obligate carnivores. Not just meat, but also fat, they might like a bit of coconit oil or butter (has no lactose) to put in the dish or lick off a fingertip.

Large cans can be refrigerated and a bit of microwave time on low will make them palatable again.

7986 2018-12-10 11:49:57 A rather confusing news piece. The "trick" of planting oil palm on recently cleared land is a well-known one... Let's hope @RSPOtweets are looking out for signs of recent vs older clearance. This article suggests otherwise.
7987 2018-12-10 11:49:55 I guess GK isn't happy with 4.5 billion for a pipeline, billions more to twin it, twice enhancing ei payments, buying rail cars and receiving more revenue from federal transfers than from the oil and gas sector.

8026 2018-12-10 11:46:14 Ummm,  you're aware that the U.S. is now a net exporter of oil.  OPEC is forced to lower their prices to compete with us.

Are you also aware the the U.S. is decreasing green house gas emissions more than any other country.  Most in the Paris accord are Increasing emissions
8027 2018-12-10 11:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however criminal aliens.
8028 2018-12-10 11:46:09 All your deserts are lovely, it’s hard to choose from! But sadly unless it’s palm oil free, I will not be buying it. I’m happy to pay a bit extra if that means it’s palm oil free. @marksandspencer and @waitrose should lead the way to environmentally friendly foods 
8029 2018-12-10 11:45:51 I think one of the most important contributions of the IMF stay could be that data releases are more reliable (i.e., divulged regularly and ALWAYS), particularly in the case of INE. But also, the oil and diamond sector data from Finance Ministry. BNA improved a lot in 2019.

8034 2018-12-10 11:45:06 Are you fucking kidding me?  Scotland raises approx 60billikn in taxes, that's not including loads of exports not counted or oil and gas leaving direct from rigs.  Scotgov budget, 34 billon.  Westminster spends ~30 billion on scotlands behalf, borrows more and charges interest!
8035 2018-12-10 11:44:51 Well, if we abandon oil and gas, etc., Saudis will be screwed i.e. the house of Saud will fall, ditto Russia, and Trump is owned by both regimes 
8036 2018-12-10 11:44:45 Well, yes. One way to stop using so much oil is to have people unemployed and poor and not driving to work. I think raising the gas tax and having some people choose cars over SUVs or buses over cars is better.
8037 2018-12-10 11:44:45 We have austerity because the last time Labour were in they opened the door to millions of health tourists, EU migrants working on low wages and being subsided with tax credit, and Labour borrowed money we didn't have for illegal invasions for oil and defence contracts!

8183 2018-12-10 11:19:44 Britain has serious problems and has been sold #Brexit snake oil as a cure.

Reversing Brexit cannot go back to the status quo ante, alternative solutions must also be on offer.
8184 2018-12-10 11:19:31 When we had just moved and winter was coming we had so little funds that we couldn't get the gas turned on. There was a program in our county that covered hardship and since we had no heat they covered the electricity bill for 3 months which freed up funds to buy oil radiators.

8188 2018-12-10 11:19:14 Really easy! Try it!  The pan must be very hot. I used to put oil to the pancake batter not to the pan. (I don't like oil )

8190 2018-12-10 11:19:03 Good reason to stop buying their oil?
8191 2018-12-10 11:18:46 Hello, the use of the RSPO trademark isn't mandatory but we encourage certified brands to display it to help consumers spot sustainable palm oil. Other tools exist, including the @wwf_uk scorecard and @gikibadges app.
8192 2018-12-10 11:18:46 Yes, he should. But as always, nothing will come of it. Not even 9/11 was enough for us to get serious with the Saudis. Too much money coming in to politician pockets and post-politics golden parachutes as highly paid indirect Saudi Arabia lobbyists (oil.)

8201 2018-12-10 11:16:48 My dream: create a secular society that cares to all members, free healthcare, free transportation, less to zero stress, sustainable food production in harmony with nature, minimalist, plastic-free, zero dependence on oil, full solar/geothermal/hydro etc energy.
8202 2018-12-10 11:15:58 Yeah,that's the point I was trying to make. People have been conditioned to think of oil in terms of anointing.

8208 2018-12-10 11:14:38 We wouldn't trade with the UK?  So they wouldnt want our oil, our electricity surplus, or our agricultural surplus?  Whisky and gin sales will dwindle to zero too?  Oh well.  Im sure we'll find *somewhere* to offload these awful goods too.

8211 2018-12-10 11:14:04 She continues to say Costa Rica has new bill on table to ban oil and gas extraction. This is necessary to guard against the gas lobby which is everywhere in Latin America and potent. Costa Rica is small but has big ideas! #COP24

8220 2018-12-10 11:11:32 Just as we have built our industrial economy on cheap oil, we have also managed to artificially inflate food production from an unsustainable reliance on underground water.

8222 2018-12-10 11:11:19 Even oil isn't necessary. The oil doesn't carry anointing. Anointing is the Spirit of Christ.

8227 2018-12-10 11:10:10 It's deffinitly an interesting area. I also like the idea a rural customer can couple an older oil boiler (they're not really zombies & last for years) with a thermal store solar system for less than a new HE boiler...and the system will produce higher #efficiency gains.

8256 2018-12-10 11:05:42 Beto Orourke portrays himself as quasi centrist and I don't take issue with ppl calling him out, taking oil $ doesn't mean you sold out though. This take lacks nuance and ignores merits of working within system/reality of system.

8278 2018-12-10 11:03:20 Interesting, surely gas / oil is the best short term transition to lower emissions (ditching coal) 

Given certain greens damming nuclear, this leaves gas as the only transitional option? Until renewables solve the storage issue at least (been reading burn out)

8455 2018-12-10 10:35:00 we depend on oil and will continue to but we don't depend on Alberta oil. This why it's exported. Why they want a pipeline to export it. There's a whole world market for us to buy oil and are willing to sell it. we also can moderate this dependence.

You have seen the light brother Malko. It is useless to fight conspiracy theories when they are grounded in facts. Real conspiracies exist and the oil industry is a master at conspiring (probably because no one is as incentivized to do it as they are).

Even though Elise is still frying the bacon, she’s trying to steal glances as Rayne goes to work. That little lapse in concentration is probably what caused a small drop of oil to land-

If the poverty level and economic failure wasn't as bad as it is then the people probably won't do that 
But no they did it cos they can't even afford to buy oil
9008 2018-12-10 08:58:25 @LizzieCornish and it was all because Iran wanted to nationalise the oil which we controlled and paid them only royalties Lizzie and what the CIA got to was disgusting and certainly no right now to slap sanctions on Iran on contrary should hang their heads in shame.

Dear Quorn,

I would highly recommend 're evaluating the ingredients in your products. Due to the recent education on Palm Oil production, and the fact it's killing these animals. I mean after all you're a very well known vegetarian brand.

9023 2018-12-10 08:54:51 You think any drug company is going to let Brexit stop the sale of its product to patients during an economic downturn?

9126 2018-12-10 08:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
9127 2018-12-10 08:32:21 Ask Westminster where 40 odd years of oil profits went.  All Scotland has to show for it is foodbanks.  And it wasn't spent here.  Norway has an oil fund in the trillions.  Our oil fund is ZERO.  Gross mismanagement #DissolveTheUnion
9128 2018-12-10 08:31:56 Cut by a scissor. Me acted like a falling stormtrooper. After the accident I scramble to find medicine to heal my x finger. Pearl powder is an instant miracle. Eating and putting on wound. Another one was sea buckthorn oil, for eating only. I had it on breakfast.

9148 2018-12-10 08:28:37 Of course not. As long as there’s coal & oil in the ground & people owning these resources there will be pressure from those interests to ignore science thus allowing for their resources to be used for power generation. It’s wealth creation for the very few nothing more

9278 2018-12-10 08:05:48 Alternative energy needs money to grow, it will not happen until people and policies support it.
So, those billions for Kinder Morgan pipeline, should have gone to alternative energies.
That money being spent on trains to transport oil, should be going to alternative energies.
9279 2018-12-10 08:05:02 Last week was excellent with THREE oil and gas holdings reporting drilling success.  Discoveries and new production for #OPHR #RPT and #RRE . Gold hitting 5 months has also pushed #RRS to new recent highs.  Looking forward to the week ahead
9280 2018-12-10 08:04:49 fascinating, isn't it, how little value is placed on the work nurses and teachers do, isn't it.  Or anything that isn't oil related.  I don't know...maybe the buggywhip manufacturers were just as intransigent but it didn't stop change in that "industry"  It diminished.

That is why Europe is still working with Iran including allowing them to use the Euro in trade & committing to by some of their exports including oil. The American foreign policy on Iran is stupid. They should use that foreign policy on Saudi Arabia.

9304 2018-12-10 07:59:50 It's unprofitable because of tax breaks that other industries get (depreciation) and home heating oil subsidies for the poor. Oh, and the Strategic Oil Reserves, that other big subsidie.

9397 2018-12-10 07:44:32 But taxing the wealthy won't make carbon more expensive, so the hundred-thousandaire has no incentive to stop driving an SUV.

Taxing the profits of oil companies might do it … because they'll pass the cost onto the consumer, which will have the same effect as a gas tax.

9415 2018-12-10 07:40:42 It's sad,really. Such essential services especially at villages at the periphery of oil sites are provided by Tullow. The residents rely on CSR from such companies due to Government neglect. Those on the defensive are just being partisan to few developed areas such as Lodwar.

9418 2018-12-10 07:40:18 Wouldn't it be cool (and probably highly unrealistic) to sell our resources amongst the provinces and maybe in the process create a sort of macro economy.

 It's probably a dumb idea but idk,we could all benefit and sell our excess globally

9434 2018-12-10 07:36:56 Not paid, but influenced sure. The oil companies have paid think tanks to influence folks into doubting climate change science since the early 90s. The protesters are coming from the right, not the left. Like American Tea Partiers.

9438 2018-12-10 07:36:32 That's because oil companies cut costs by slashing jobs and when there are fewer employees, there is less need for desk space. They cut costs because of the global supply glut. It's a structural change and we'll have to get used to it.
9439 2018-12-10 07:36:30 Not all sustainable palm oil is sustainable so if you’re concerned, get in touch with the company. At my last job we used palm oil made in a lab so it never even was sourced from land. But some sustainable palm oil is grown in “certified growing areas” which has more tree loss.

9690 2018-12-10 06:59:08 what does essential oil even mean pretty sure lavender isn't needed for me to function what a scheme
9691 2018-12-10 06:59:05 If I’m putting in 80+ a week I deserve to do what I wanna do. When im in the oil fields it’s only going to double.
9692 2018-12-10 06:58:52 Snake oil has a ROI for the seller.
9693 2018-12-10 06:58:44 Make sure they don’t reuse their oil so they’re vegan
9694 2018-12-10 06:58:14 Well yeah that's the issue. There's many plant based fats they can use but I'm sure it'll effect taste. I'm just saying that the fat content is the only thing really holding it back. I know beyond meat uses coconut oil but not sure what impossible burger uses
9695 2018-12-10 06:58:10 Global big oil is killing the planet - this must stop - for our children and grandchildren’s future

9701 2018-12-10 06:57:55 The price of oil may never rise to its pre-2014 levels. Doom for all countries - mostly third world - that have their economies tied like an umbilical cord to the commodity
9702 2018-12-10 06:57:53 I am challenging the socialist party to Confront the oil industry with a proposal to build a national water shed sharing infrastructure. The art of the deal begins with bringing something to the table other than political force. Confront the water emergency everyone wins.
9703 2018-12-10 06:57:44 How would they know. And how do we know bottles of these oil won't get to ibadan. It's very complex. And its sad. I didn't watch the video.
9704 2018-12-10 06:57:37 I know. Those oil rig workers and their kind, away for weeks on end, don't know how lucky they are!
9705 2018-12-10 06:57:25 Me too, said the Terrorist sponsoring Nations, where good American money flowed for years for Oil.

9707 2018-12-10 06:56:51 Lice actually like clean hair! So don't feel bad or like you've done something wrong. It's almost unavoidable. I know I had it as a kid, and even Robert got it already! Try not to be so hard on yourself. Also just for the future, put some tea tree oil into her shampoo!

9711 2018-12-10 06:56:01 Saw a video of Nigerians scooping vegetable oil from a gutter and I was disgusted. How the fuck can you blame this on poverty. Demma wickedness be on a different level.

9713 2018-12-10 06:55:47 Sam Kutesa was censured in 1999 for misuse of office when he was Finance Minister. In 2008, he was ac used of taking oil bribes and in 2014 as UN Assembly Pres he misused his office. Sevo has retained him. What does this mean? A fish rots from the head. Take lessons. Look at ANC.
9714 2018-12-10 06:55:43 #freshlypressed981 as my good friend @Henryemmanuel64 will say, we practice vodoo economics in Nigeria. There's no subsidy but under recovery, however the synonymously obvious both are. It's December & oil marketers know the best time to apply pressure
9715 2018-12-10 06:55:38 Good morning sir, I just watched the video and the oil were looking unsuspecting now I'm worried cause this can go beyond that area.

And there is a lot in that gutter 
9716 2018-12-10 06:55:27 Or, dedicate this day to the 1000's of orangutans tha will die so we can have palm oil to make more cookies.
9717 2018-12-10 06:55:26 I peel them as the season advances and the outer skin toughens. That sounds yum with olive oil and Parmesan.
9718 2018-12-10 06:55:15 Wormtongue LOTR
Obsequeous, lying, chancer peddling lies to make himself appear greater than he is, and threatenng people who would expose him for the snake oil salesman that he is.
9719 2018-12-10 06:55:13 We were oil and water lying side by side
We did everything we could trying to collide
9720 2018-12-10 06:55:07 20. England's oil reserves are worth over £250 billion. The E.U. now regards those reserves as a `shared E.U. resource'. 

21. The Government has handed England's £32 billion worth of gold and dollar reserves over to the E.U.
9721 2018-12-10 06:55:01 Tatarski steps up to the plate, swings and misses! He said he'd worked in Oil & Gas.

9723 2018-12-10 06:54:54 Almost certain he'll need barrels of oil in the next transfer window to sort this squad out !
9724 2018-12-10 06:54:53 Alberta oil per barrel is selling at $11.67 last I checked. So yeah, I’m not to excited about the job @RachelNotley has done. At all. The future of Alberta looks very grim what with our present economic situation. That is, if Rachel has anything to do with it.
9725 2018-12-10 06:54:38 Oil’s gains risk being quelled by uncertainty over how the OPEC+ coalition will implement its deal to cut output, according to #GoldmanSachs Group Inc. and #MorganStanley.
9726 2018-12-10 06:54:09 Then I peel them cause my kids won't eat them otherwise. Back when they were little my mum used to cook and peel and a little olive oil and some Parmesan cheese - afternoon tea for wee ones.
9727 2018-12-10 06:54:03 Exactly this. Non-stop unconditional tax rebates for corporations with no strings attached paid for by increasing charges on people. Not making ends meet while working.
Plus the tiredness of permanent lies, such as 'we triple-tax oil to invest in roads & rails & the environment'
9728 2018-12-10 06:54:00 And we all drive those cars on asphalt. And we buy plastics. But no oil at all!

9730 2018-12-10 06:53:42 I want male strippers at my funeral. Strippers, as in multiple. At least four, one for each corner of the casket. They can do there dirty dick dancing to distract the world of what it just lost, even if for just a brief, baby oil soaked moment.
9731 2018-12-10 06:53:31 I struggle with these type of stories when I get them. Like the oil company planning an "air bnb for eco-friendly homes". I know oil companies do lots of biofuel stuff. They're trying to change. But am I falling for their PR hype if I run a story about every 'new initiative'?
9732 2018-12-10 06:53:14 Food is no longer vegan when it’s been fried in oil which has cooked meat. Most fast food fries are not vegan.
9733 2018-12-10 06:53:10 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.

9738 2018-12-10 06:52:15 Relevant today. So now ALL Ballot Box votes will be re run every 2 years because people have died and the demographic has changed. Do you sell snake oil in your spare time #brexit
9739 2018-12-10 06:52:13 I don't know which world Buhari is living in, but that Nigerians could be collecting spilled cooking oil from the gutter doesn't support his narrative...

9753 2018-12-10 06:49:40 And we get oil from Saudi Arabia which supplied many of the 9/11 attackers, is committing genocide in Yemen, & murdered a US resident journalist. The world would be better off w/o any fossil fuel but that's another story. Our European allies provide NATO w/ bases, troops, weapons
9754 2018-12-10 06:49:31 A much bigger economic chain profits from the subsidizing of oil as a raw product compared to the direct subsidizing of an end-product.
9755 2018-12-10 06:49:17 I prefer matcha tea in the morning  with no coconut oil

9761 2018-12-10 06:47:35 Absolutely. We should pivot toward renewable energy quickly to give these dictators from oil producing countries the boot and remove the point of confliction.
9762 2018-12-10 06:47:34 Yes, I do.

9766 2018-12-10 06:46:48 Yet they will sell this oil...
9767 2018-12-10 06:46:41 The GOP has made it clear they don’t care about American’s health. — Let them drink poisoned water (#Flint), let them breath polluted air, don’t switch to clean energy, focus on coal and oil, climate change isn’t real, don’t let everyone get health care...
9768 2018-12-10 06:46:37 You can just say it’s your baby powder essential oil and the rattles can be dog toys. I’m sure she wouldn’t notice or mind anyhow 
9769 2018-12-10 06:46:32 Yes. And Jared Kushner for aiding and abetting the head of the Saudi Oil Mafia. When you take a step back, never in the history of the White House has a Sr. Advisor deliberately tried to cover up an assassination of an American resident, especially a DC journalist.
9770 2018-12-10 06:46:31 I’ve ruined my sheets from all the lavender oil I put on them every night, but I don’t care because I’m going to bed calm and relaxed. It’s like Xanax for my mind.

9777 2018-12-10 06:45:45 You're comparing water to cooking oil? Water that can be taken from a well for free? In the most expensive slums, how much is a big bowl of water? 1 bottle of oil will buy drums of water. You can't compare both. Plus they can refine that oil from the gutter water.
9778 2018-12-10 06:45:45 He just doesn’t care about the west... bottom line. Supports Saudi oil but notus. didn’t he say at the beginning of winning election that Canada has no core identity. Well he truly meant that... what a pompous ass
9779 2018-12-10 06:45:38 When the oil prices soared high, the entire opposition blamed Modi & BJP.

9812 2018-12-10 06:40:22 We can see that in how people currently fight their asses off in the name of oil and gas rather than trying to drive investment into cleaner, more renewable energy. This imbalance remains even now, when we know it needs to go away.

9818 2018-12-10 06:40:02 In July 2018, N348 billion was approved by NASSS for subsidy payment to oil marketers.

In December 2018, Government is now owing oil marketers N800 billion, and blaming predecessors for it. How?! #TopicalIssues

9862 2018-12-10 06:34:42 I have an idea. Not the best easist solution but because you know pipelines are so bad. Lets build a huge convoyer from the coast to the praries. We put grain and coal on it and then put oil on the train. Less people are mad and we get more product to the coast.

9867 2018-12-10 06:33:54 Chicken is coming home to roost for Canada who's been allowing all this money laundering. It is not in their best interest to see real estate collapse because the majority of the banks rely on the overinflated house prices for support right now - especially since the oil collapse

9871 2018-12-10 06:33:11 Also, how long could the world economy stand oil prices well north of $100 a barrel, which is where they would be for $2 a litre petrol to be reality? I doubt very long given past experience and the seeming fragility of much of the global economy currently.

9877 2018-12-10 06:32:45 Part of Canada exports oil, most of Canada imports oil.

9879 2018-12-10 06:32:07 I also think I saw a (probably hyper-targeted) ad from @calcattlemen or @BeefUSA about this? I'm super into the idea of oil companies paying California ranchers to move their herds in different ways to improve carbon sequestration in grasslands!
9880 2018-12-10 06:32:04 Not nearly enough, obviously, with your deficit :) Our regular corporate tax is about 25% - oil revenue profits are taxed specifically on top of that, because the source of those profits are OUR natural resources. Consider it "rent".
9881 2018-12-10 06:32:03 In my view that’s why we have accidents. I do not think though that it’s the driver’s problem. The bus must be checked before departure. Everything! Fuel! Pressure! Oil. If a stinking toilet was not inspected... ko ma tyre? Governance of transport companies ine nyaya.
9882 2018-12-10 06:31:57 Are we paying them to keep their oil in the ground? To not harvest natural resources? If so, hydroelectric sales should be included in transfer payment calculations.
9883 2018-12-10 06:31:56 Listen numbnuts if you're going to tweet at least be accurate... The Rand came no where near R14 to $ in 2008, average ROE 1$=R8,25 and oil average closing price was under $97 per barrel... apply that to your comparison and you'll see just how flawed yours is...
9884 2018-12-10 06:31:56 It would depend on how higher oil prices are delivered, if it was through strong demand, then yes, other commodities will be pulled along. If it is through supply restrictions, either voluntary (OPEC) or involuntary (Iran sanctions), then probably not.
9885 2018-12-10 06:31:49 Mexico's new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that tenders for the construction of a new large oil refinery in the country's southeastern state of Tabasco would be announced no later than March 2019.

9892 2018-12-10 06:31:17 In  a + b = c. 

If a is crude oil price and b is production and transportation and other associated cost and c is the constant government approved fuel price. With increase in crude oil price, subsidy is in the system. And someone is paying.
9893 2018-12-10 06:31:12 Alberta has benefited greatly from oil revenues. Right now the province needs help from the rest of Canada to return to that situation. Doesnt seem unfair considering the benefits AB has shared with the rest of country.
9894 2018-12-10 06:30:53 ...or, someone called her out for being an arrogant, conceited, reactionary, peddler of ‘right-wing snake oil.’ Yep, got it now!

9950 2018-12-10 06:22:49 @CITY1051 that groundnut oil case in Lagos to me is not poverty some r just greedy cos most of them would not use but still sell it to innocent people is just mere stupidity and wickedness
9951 2018-12-10 06:22:40 My nose is currently producing enough oil to fry an egg wtf
9952 2018-12-10 06:22:35 Data is the new oil. Surprised the ARU aren’t using blockchain technology as part of their review
9953 2018-12-10 06:22:33 what a good boy i just dip my oil brushes back into the mineral water and tinfoil my used paint up and keep going
9954 2018-12-10 06:22:06 Let me know when it matches the $50+ billion that the oil and gas industry receives every year.
9955 2018-12-10 06:21:36 If only the peasants would go away and let business run the show. Then we'd see how amazing it is. Wait, we did that. It looks like a downtown core ravished by business bankruptcy every time oil prices go down.

9959 2018-12-10 06:21:13 Simples - two reasons 1. oil companies (mainly) and other big multi-nationals are more interested in short term profit than long term sustainability. 2. There is nobody really tackling population growth.

9961 2018-12-10 06:20:28 The HCF in the PIGB like I have said before will only serve to divide the ND further by creating a new exclusive class with access to a part of the oil wealth. Another set of warlord's will emerge a decade after it.
9962 2018-12-10 06:20:08 It's going to be interesting as to how Russia, and Ukraine secure oil and natural gas pipelines to their own countries.
9963 2018-12-10 06:20:05 Nice litany of Faux News talking points. Germany has been buying natural gas and oil from Russia since the deepest Cold War, but also from the UK, Norway and many other countries.
9964 2018-12-10 06:19:49 The itinerary for tomorrow issss...going to the post office, going to my t checkup, and then getting an oil change. And comms in between

9969 2018-12-10 06:19:14 I once over took an oil tanker on a highway with zero visibility of oncoming vehicles, late in the evening...
9970 2018-12-10 06:19:08 Actually the provinces that have a carbon tax program are the ones that have the best economies in the country. In Alberta for example people that make less get a tax credit. Big oil actually asked for it. The exception were the Koch brothers who've been interfering in elections

9977 2018-12-10 06:18:01 So, it has now become a routine in Nigeria that festive periods especially December towards yuletide, oil marketers will hold Nigerians to ransom because of negligence on the path of our supposed leaders. It's a SHAME on those that think they own NIGERIA.
9978 2018-12-10 06:17:53 Cbd, I started smoking cbd recently and using the oil. It’s honestly helped me so much with constantly over thinking & keeping me from being so socially awkward lol
9979 2018-12-10 06:17:46 Talking of poodles, you really took in all that snake oil peddled by Cameron in 2010 didnt you? Did it hurt when you discovered what an abject liar he was or havent you got that far yet?
9980 2018-12-10 06:17:44 Merry Christmas Tammy-Lynn!  Wonderful!
9981 2018-12-10 06:17:39 Exactly.

High wages mean high cost of living.

Ever see the rents in Fort Mac? Edmonton? Especially during the high oil price days?

Well, those numbers have not come down much.

9986 2018-12-10 06:16:56 Hey let’s not make this into a peak oil debate. Which is far worse. There will be a cliff at some point and the fact is no one knows what will happen is a feature. Kind of how life works.

9989 2018-12-10 06:16:10 I provide technical and military support to the Saudi military, does that make me a Mobster? Do the over 100,000 defense and oil industry jobs provided for by Saudi contracts make all of them mobsters?

9994 2018-12-10 06:15:51 People will notice fuel prices going up. The #GiletsJaunes' timing is more about an increase in oil prices than the tax itself.
9995 2018-12-10 06:15:33 Can you add to that? 
The IEA predicts oil demand to increase until st least 2040. I see no reason why Canada should not use oil revenue to help fund the transition.
9996 2018-12-10 06:15:27 多少凝るか
9997 2018-12-10 06:15:25 LMAO the only thing you conservatives can run well is crime rings.  Certainly not countries or states.  The real welfare states are those run by Republicans for the exception of Texas.  Even then, if they dont start thinking passed oil; their days too are numbered.

9999 2018-12-10 06:15:20 Brent crude oil prices rose on Monday after OPEC and some non-OPEC members last Friday agreed to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day from January.OPEC will account for 800,000bpd cut.
Brent at $61.96

10004 2018-12-10 06:14:41 Well, it's investment revenue. The oil revenue is invested. It's about 10% of the budget, I believe.

The US could easily do the same. It's taxes on profits.
10005 2018-12-10 06:14:40 Hey Gareth, here are some interesting facts for you.
In 2008, crude oil was $140 a barrel at R14 to the US dollar yet fuel at the pumps were R8 a litre
In 2018, crude oil is $62 a barrel at R14 to the dollar yet fuel is R16 a litre
