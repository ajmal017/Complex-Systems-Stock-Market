17 2018-03-01 23:57:09 Grain/oil in western Canada can’t get to market due to insufficient rail services. Trudeau is doing this on purpose.
18 2018-03-01 23:57:03 Neither agreeing or disagreeing, as no expert.
Most affluent countries in the World, asides from ME oil rich ones, are the Scandinavian ones, who have best GDP per capita.
It would seem to make more sense to seek advice from those with proven economic track records.

38 2018-03-01 23:56:22 Chug some castor oil!!
39 2018-03-01 23:56:20 could use a little seal oil too.
40 2018-03-01 23:56:11 all i ask is that ppl stop putting coconut oil in their hair
41 2018-03-01 23:56:04 Just regular vegetable (rapeseed/canola) oil. You can buy the cold pressed one of you want best quality. Either way it's actually quite low in saturated fat
42 2018-03-01 23:55:56 Melbourne Heart's begginings was largely about MV fans not wanting to support MV and I quote "because we don't like Merrick & Muscat'. That was literally the line from many Heart fans back in the day. Now at least you have an identity I guess. A Middle Eastern Oil Baron identity.
43 2018-03-01 23:55:42 John Bolton is what they used to try and stop the BP oil spill.
They only termed it a little different calling it their "Junk Shot."
44 2018-03-01 23:55:37 Tonight is all cannabis oil and fruit snacks. I ain't mad at it.
45 2018-03-01 23:55:26 Car maintenance is expensive as shiiit. sparkplugs,oil filters,cabin air filters bla bla bla. It's a bike thing this summer.
46 2018-03-01 23:55:23 “Have a blast” hahaha I mean that oil funnel can work too but this one was specially made for this type of situation. The first time I came across one was @ Coachella and it was fucking cardboard which didn’t work so well. But YA!! Beats poppin a squat 
47 2018-03-01 23:55:13 Changed the oil on my car by myself today for the first time. Shit was a piece of cake until I realized I didn't put the screw back on to contain the oil 
48 2018-03-01 23:55:01 @MikeSmythNews Oil Industrialists that don't want Canadian Oil sold off shore fighting Oil Industrialists that want to sell Canadian Oil offshore
49 2018-03-01 23:54:47 Why so harsh dude, oil is going to flow in any vein cuz you too and im sure you realize are using alot everyday.
50 2018-03-01 23:54:45 & one more thing lol  i use an Argan oil leave in conditioner, it smells amazing &it also keeps my hair soft, and it protects it from day to day damage which is important for me because i have long hair! I think it’s 12$ at Walgreens but it lasts awhile &it also smells amazing!
51 2018-03-01 23:54:41 But not the cleanest and not renewable. Sorry but that’s the bottom line for me. I fully support our existing oil & gas industry but future has to be different
52 2018-03-01 23:54:38 I’m not sure how my mom did the pizza crust. But for the wrap I put the cauliflower in the oven (no batter or anything) for about a half hour, then put it onto the stove in a pan with buffalo sauce. For the nachos I had it in a pan with olive oil and taco seasoning, then oven
53 2018-03-01 23:54:36 9-10 โมงค่ะ อย่าลืมเอาเสื้อแขนยาวมาด้วยน๊า
54 2018-03-01 23:54:35 Or until their oil well runs dry
55 2018-03-01 23:54:30 I'd give it a miss! 
Also? 
Stay away from seasonally closed down oil drilling sites and junkie squats.
56 2018-03-01 23:54:15 Approach car covered with snow: 1, remove as much loose snow as possible from ALL windows AND lights. 2, don’t forget the roof (it blows off into other traffic at speed). 3, check car fluid levels (screen wash, oil, coolant). 4, Start car and allow to warm up 5, turn lights ON!!
57 2018-03-01 23:54:14 it's been awhile since i burned the midnight oil. To think staying up all night was once de rigueur.
58 2018-03-01 23:54:11 When 92% of a politician’s campaign funds come from oil and gas billionaires that don’t live in the district, but do harvest natural gas in the district, I don’t think it’s at all remarkable how many people think that.
59 2018-03-01 23:53:44 I swear to god (cause I used to hangout with a bunch of outdoor in the city peeing ratchets) they use the curb technique. And id always be like. Yo hit up the good ol local automotive joint and get you some oil changing funnels and you can aim your pee and have a blast
60 2018-03-01 23:53:23 Canada doesn't have the means to mass create jobs to support new immigrants, thanks in part to our seasonal climate then thanks to NAFTA our manufacturing is dead, our oil sector is dying, but hey I guess there's still government jobs
61 2018-03-01 23:52:30 The Mandatory Oil Import Program that was law from 1959 to 1973 created massive distortions, wealth transfers, and considerable cost with no aggregate benefit.

It was repealed once a major crisis set in.
62 2018-03-01 23:52:24 7. Nowadays. Afghanistan is a Russian's geostrategic block piece.
Not keeping Afg prevents them to reach the coasts of Central Asia, through the valleys of Cashmere in India and through Balochistan to the Indian Ocean. Afg. blocks China to a short bypass to the persian gulf oil.
63 2018-03-01 23:52:20 Congratulations to Glenn F. for winning the Go Green email drawing for a free oil change in February!

69 2018-03-01 23:51:26 How to oil your Boss...
70 2018-03-01 23:51:22 or more like just a bit of heat to break the emulsion

and i also ended up adding more oil which destabilized it even more
71 2018-03-01 23:50:58 More air pollution from oil & gas operations that will threaten public health #CleanAir4Kids
72 2018-03-01 23:50:58 Haircare/beauty twitter: can anybody  recommend a cheaaaap coconut oil? Or other natural oils for haircare etc? Atm I put olive oil on my hair and for skincare I make a baby lotion and sea salt scrub, would like to try and have something I can use for both.
73 2018-03-01 23:50:54 I think my car is driving bad because I need an oil change. The little sticker thing is not in the windshield so I know I’m overdue

75 2018-03-01 23:50:34 It's unequivocal public knowledge that oil corps are the #1 target of cyber attacks for the purpose of stealing intellectual property and Tillerson while at xom created the industry stnd best of the best cyber-security protocol and now will do same for U.S. and block all Russia.
76 2018-03-01 23:50:32 When y’all cook pancakes do y’all use butter or olive oil in the pan ? 
77 2018-03-01 23:50:08 I gotta give Stella some TLC next weekend. Car wash oil change and a good service. Cause this here , is my baby.
78 2018-03-01 23:50:06 The only thing to watch is the USD getting stronger, driving up oil prices and making Putin rich.
79 2018-03-01 23:50:04 Well then maybe it’s cause since your eyes are open most of the time oil can accumulate on your eyelids
80 2018-03-01 23:49:58 Reminds me of an MLM conference where a bunch of snake oil “consultants” pay to learn how to take advantage of people who don’t know what they’re getting into
81 2018-03-01 23:49:55 Its a total laugh that people protest something they use abundantly everyday, its almost as if no one knows what oil is used for where it all comes from and how dirty the oil biz was just 20 30 years ago. I challenge anyone to not use oil or anything made with it for one day,
82 2018-03-01 23:49:40 So the good folk of Blackpool can see Farage is selling a fracking pup, but that doesn't make them suspicious of him generally... once a snake oil salesman...
83 2018-03-01 23:49:34 One doesn’t pay child support in California? His father was a lawyer for Getty Oil and a judge.
84 2018-03-01 23:49:30 Really need to change my oil this weekend
85 2018-03-01 23:49:23 Sounds like if you put one of those grape water flavorers into a bottle of peanut oil.
86 2018-03-01 23:49:22 Was the oil money not there last season .the year before? What about the other year before that...
87 2018-03-01 23:49:21 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
88 2018-03-01 23:49:20 Basically, anyone who can help doesn't care, and anyone who cares can't help. @RachelNotley happily pledges millions to support the oil industry, but people on AISH somehow aren't quite human & worth a second glance.
89 2018-03-01 23:49:14 #WW3 is utter madness. #Russia's not the enemy--it's the #DeepState-#Oligarchy who are the real enemies from inside the #USA: their #Greed drives #Wars4Profit-#MilitaryIndustrialComplex-#CorporateFascism. They'll kill many innocents in order to grab land, oil & mineral resources.
90 2018-03-01 23:49:11 He says stuff and doesn't know the law. Unfortunately our POTUS is a snake oil salesman.
91 2018-03-01 23:48:41 Hey @IAMSAFAREE, what make your Coconut oil better than the others?
92 2018-03-01 23:48:20 Who supplied terrorists with weapons? who bought syrian oil from #daesh? Who stole factory equipment from #Aleppo? It wasn't syria, and one thing is for sure the terrorist state of turkey will not be forgiven nor will it be forgotten. #EasternGhouta it's ur terrorists!there
93 2018-03-01 23:48:14 Man AND I gotta get new tires...and an oil change soon lmao I’m stressed

96 2018-03-01 23:48:01 More the ship what amazes me is when you spend a lifetime in military or social work then suddenly become an international oil trader, in just one or two years. Isnt that a genius? Or an actor playing the show for a business tycoon hiding behind the curtain? #Maldives #NorthKorea

People have no problem understanding that Fracking is an extractive industry, they extract oil & gas from the earth.
What people need to understand is capitalism in general is an extractive industry.
106 2018-03-01 23:46:22 Lol!
107 2018-03-01 23:46:14 That's beautiful.  I love oil.  I try to buy landscape oil paintings wherever we travel.

2. Los que estudian en Yale no pueden. 
3. México necesita de un señor que tardó 16 años en sacar promedio de 6.5 en la UNAM, que no habla inglés y que nunca ha trabajado.
109 2018-03-01 23:46:07 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and if he doesn't have kompromat on Trump I'd be shocked.
110 2018-03-01 23:45:57 @chrisFoxx @Cam35 Asian countries need more oil,
111 2018-03-01 23:45:55 センスの塊
112 2018-03-01 23:45:35 Leadership and Chris Christie are like oil and water
113 2018-03-01 23:45:26 15% severance tax on coal, oil or gas extracted in WV. Most states have diversified economies that is why 3-5% is enough. All we and Alaska have are extraction and tourism, that is why Alaska has a 35% severance & what money is left after paying everything goes back to the people

133 2018-03-01 23:42:59 Our neighbour, who we know only a little, just spotted me and @sarahboiv changing the wiper fluid in our car. Instantly, he marches over and checks our oil, coolant and transmission fluid levels, in a tiny act of random kindness that I didn't really know how to process.
134 2018-03-01 23:42:46 I thought you changed the subject from an oil pipeline to sewage outfall in Victoria, must be my mistake
135 2018-03-01 23:42:44 Check out these dials and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
136 2018-03-01 23:42:37 It has to be Yamo. He’s just a very different player than we’re accustomed to in oil country - especially with Chia at the helm. An undersized offensive dynamo w/ a goal-scorer’s instincts will be something to see. Shout out to Benson putting in work to make people excited again.

146 2018-03-01 23:42:07 tfw i blitzed oil + onions in a food processor too long and accidentally made an onion mayo
147 2018-03-01 23:41:59 Those oil can?
148 2018-03-01 23:41:51 can only clip Putin with low oil prices. Canada may get slammed if OPEC and others ramp up to neuter russia.
149 2018-03-01 23:41:45 Minus the oil in the sachet for me, everything else on point.
150 2018-03-01 23:41:37 Westminster squanders North Sea Oil, wages *utterly pointless* wars of attrition, builds a one-dimensional, casino/money laundering based economy. It collapses, Westminster & the media blame the EU. The poorly educated de facto serfs of britain cluck in agreement. #bbcqt
151 2018-03-01 23:41:20 Exactly. The differences between sauteing in a small amount of oil and coconut milk fat and pork fat are negligible. The veggies will still feed you.

158 2018-03-01 23:40:05 @holland_barrett I really feel that as a responsible retailer, you should put a warning on the CBD oil that it can stop the contraceptive pill working... or are unwanted pregnancies the aim?
159 2018-03-01 23:40:04 Thanks for getting tough on protecting OUR coastal economy that relies on a healthy environment. BTW oil spill cleanup is a joke.

161 2018-03-01 23:39:49 All you have to do is outnumber them...and then all politicians will talk like this. They'll talk like this about oil companies. About the tyranny of corporations.

Because it will be you talking.

170 2018-03-01 23:38:39 #bbcqt Earthquakes constitute another problem associated with deep-well oil and gas drilling. Scientists refer to the earthquakes caused by the injection of fracking wastewater underground as "induced seismic events." Although most of the earthquakes are small in magnitude
171 2018-03-01 23:38:35 Wow they used 10 oil urns and molotov cocktails there

175 2018-03-01 23:38:02 Crash in the second lane on EB 215 S between Redwood Rd and the 15 interchange. No injuries but there is an oil leak that will probably cause issues for the drive home.
176 2018-03-01 23:37:55 but Ms Lahren is a typical snake oil salesman. typical charlatan.  She is getting rich off of making idiotic, red meat, statements such as these.

191 2018-03-01 23:36:01 This friend asked me to help her attract the attention of some rando she works with
Not difficult, I’d just need to mix alittle follow-me-boy oil and give it to her 
But since I’m not really picking up an urgent need from my friend, I simply asked “what’ll give me in return”?
192 2018-03-01 23:35:47 It cut American gas prices by half. It then caused the oil price to tumble. It has saved the world billions. #bbcqt

my point is, a pipeline will spill oil and increased tanker traffic will likely result in coast waters spill

208 2018-03-01 23:34:08 It starts at the top, #DONTHECON taught her how to do snake oil deals and getaway with it bc white collar crimes pay and u get no jail time. That’s what happens when u live a life of privilege, u getaway with being a criminal.

213 2018-03-01 23:33:48 Evidence from countries which allow #fracking - such as the USA - tell us the water supply can be totally overwhelmed or destroyed as a result.
You can't drink oil. Save water instead. #bbcqt
214 2018-03-01 23:33:41 They use a different way to tax the oil and gas companies.  Cmon man you’re not fooling anyone.

I prefer to take reality a little less tainted with fantasy, for important issues.
Hope, unless checked and found well grounded, is a snake oil salesman, making promises it can't keep.

307 2018-03-01 23:23:38 I think that's only part of the issue. For all the oil money, there was a huge influx of coaches who not only had the skill set of Wenger regarding fitness etc, but had better tactical understanding. Wenger was lucky to have intelligent players, and never replaced

317 2018-03-01 23:23:04 B.) US Army tanks get futuristic shields that destroy inc. missiles... C.) Trump says he will order tariffs on steel, oil imports next week as he met with businessmen from the industry today...He has to make a position on steel:

Just tossing out words trying to sell your snake oil is absolute bullshit. Yeah, I CALL some serious BS here.

337 2018-03-01 23:21:14 Oil and gas is very important for regional NZ. It pays twice the average salary, and is the most productive sector in the NZ economy. Major economic benefits, all managed by a comprehensive regulatory system that rightly places a price on the externalities from carbon emissions.
338 2018-03-01 23:21:11 and yet Donny would destroy it all if he could sell it to another country or oil/mining company. And Pruitt would say it is god's will.

344 2018-03-01 23:20:47 I didn't see anything in the proposal that suggests differential treatment for an oil drilling start up vs. a tech start up, so I don't know that it's a sector discrimination issue.
345 2018-03-01 23:20:43 Also, Garrett, using rather small countries greatly benefiting from North Sea oil to spread around and with one of the highest work ethics in the world (I am Swedish) is probably not the best examples to use - and even they are rethinking (I have many Swedish friends)

What about adding olive oil?
No culinary reason to do this either.

366 2018-03-01 23:18:45 It's kinda similar to Carl's Jr, before they bought up the other chains. I hated their onion rings, chopped and formed so they pack 5 pieces neatly into a serving cup. Their chicken fries had a cool campaign.

The "low fat" fries was something else. Sprayed with plastic oil, yuck

416 2018-03-01 23:11:49 @seanhannity You know why shale oil extraction is up? It's up because oil prices are up. As soon as oil prices go down, shale oil extraction will shut down. It happened when we had the oil glut and prices dropped.
417 2018-03-01 23:11:27 I recognise and applaud your attempt to pour oil on troubled waters, Eric, and I'll do my best to respond in kind.

429 2018-03-01 23:09:42 Totally incorrect. The chief geologist from PNG, this morning advising that the problem came from about 60 km deep. Nothing to do with gas oil extraction between 2000 and 4000 m deep.

444 2018-03-01 23:08:34 Inflammatory and inaccurate! Supply is low because of unexpected demand in this cold snap, but reserves... Hmm a different subject. Oil rigs burn the gas fraction as its too costly to pressurise and barrel in situ.
445 2018-03-01 23:08:32 @JustinTrudeau What a great country Canada is, eh ?  But Canada can't move their grain, can't move their oil, Can't pay their employees, and has some of the highest debt on this planet. Is the Canadian way of life sustainable ?  I hear the cost of living is quite high too.
446 2018-03-01 23:08:27 I think it was @TheEconomist that said that the most important resource in the 21st Century is not oil, but data.

Let me explain.

Imagine a yellow Lagos taxi cab infront of an estate; his car is parked there for hours. He has absolutely no idea how many people need his services

529 2018-03-01 22:57:41 I hate those damn things! I was driving from here to Madison, Wisconsin and in Illinois they have wind farms. The reason being they want to reduce dependency on oil which is BS. No oil produces electricity. It's all coal.

539 2018-03-01 22:57:05 $7 is less than $20-plus discount on Western Cdn heavy oil.  Does this mean that the complaints about  lack of pipelines costing Canada tens of billions of dollars are exaggerated?
540 2018-03-01 22:57:03 No, it'll totally work. I'm just saying you can get it in oil or extract form in capsules or tablets, which will work from the inside out, minus the smell and, well, that gross feeling of oil on one's face (whatever good things it may be doing).

572 2018-03-01 22:53:06 but in other news: i’ve had a very productive day. homework done, full tank, oil changed, car cleaned out & washed. ready for this cool lil’ weekend trip 
573 2018-03-01 22:53:03 桜おめでとう！！！！！！！！
574 2018-03-01 22:52:48 That’s what I thought, like you have to be careful even diffusing them around cats. I have peppermint oil but I don’t diffuse it, just use it on my temples for headaches when I can’t get to ibuprofen.
575 2018-03-01 22:52:46 Clarinet lotus treatment face oil 
576 2018-03-01 22:52:42 it would drive up the price of metal thus making it more profitable to mine more here in USA - putting more ppl to work - just look at oil - prices go up we americans go back to work in the oil fields etc.
577 2018-03-01 22:52:21 Removing regulations that make workers safer. not punishing polluters, nor regulating offshore wells making another oil spill likely. Removed restrictions on mentally ill people getting guns. Not punishing Russia. Trump is a traitor to the United States.
578 2018-03-01 22:52:09 Tonight!! The Return of Graineys Basement with Nude Oil, Astro Phobes, Jerkwadz, and @SpaceCarBoise !! Going to be a great night!! @TGGBBoise, @tomgraineys, @TheJerkwadz #AddamsFamily
579 2018-03-01 22:51:59 Worried about the affects of fracking? Our early afternoon @DowntownDocFest movie at BSUC 2:30 pm-4:00 pm Unfractured Following activist Sandra Steinberger leading the fight against fracking by the oil and gas industry.
580 2018-03-01 22:51:47 Think Tillerson and Exxon. Doesn't Condi have an oil tanker named after her?
581 2018-03-01 22:51:18 Getting the front end upgraded. And probably get it serviced. Oil change, check the fluids shit like that..
582 2018-03-01 22:51:17 VTEC solenoid.. Rotors... tires... Oil leak.... i got a long few months ahead of me
583 2018-03-01 22:51:16 The safest oil, is oil that stays underground. The only real progress, is moving to alternative sources of energy. Ad hominen attacks are childish. You would be much more effective if you specifically identified points I made which weren't factual.
584 2018-03-01 22:51:07 @OIL_kasin 満月になると毛深くなる、って設定が影狼はあるらしいんですが、それを髪が伸びると解釈するのってどう想います？　（広がる長い髪描く口実ですが
585 2018-03-01 22:51:07 @amcseason2 All i have to say about thst is cannibas oil
586 2018-03-01 22:50:58 I don’t understand why people don’t research their cars before they buy them??? how are you going to buy a car that requires synthetic oil and then get mad when it’s time for an oil change and you got the most expensive oil??
587 2018-03-01 22:50:53 Take 2 weeks oil but you need to see s doctor asap. Trust me unless it's an infection it works...
588 2018-03-01 22:50:39 Why? He was a Snake Oil salesman who was negative about Jewish people! Should raise the flag higher!
589 2018-03-01 22:50:18 Lol
Its a fish snack
Its smoked herring in oil
No worries, a lot of ppl ask me wtf I'm talking about

590 2018-03-01 22:49:58 Rosehip oil is good for your skin. Did you know that you could get the same (if not more) of its benefits by taking it in capsule form...?
591 2018-03-01 22:49:51 I see. Pity... There is nothing better than sweet potatoes fried in coconut oil... or quinoa salad with sweet potatoes... could kill for thatnow I’m hungry, great...
592 2018-03-01 22:49:50 E go shock Una,May God spare our lives...
593 2018-03-01 22:49:48 You were talking about "Globalism and Sovereignty" 
US politics is Geopolitics..
The US is an oil company with an army, and a protection racket.
If you want to u/s what's going on you can't focus on the actors on the stage. Pay attention to the action in the box office.
594 2018-03-01 22:49:47 When is interior secretary  going to break it up and open it for gas and oil like he did in utah
595 2018-03-01 22:49:35 Tgok sikit muka make over  dah hilang belum ?? HAHAHAHAHA pi letak baby oil .
596 2018-03-01 22:49:26 I think the only option left to save my skin is to deep fat fry myself in coconut oil
597 2018-03-01 22:49:21 I'm gonna keep guessing just so you know. 

I'm thinking it's a shampoo/conditioner with coconut oil and it's called Redemption. 

Okay I'm done I got nothing else.
598 2018-03-01 22:49:13 人生経験！
599 2018-03-01 22:49:13 I've run out of cleanser (other than oil cleanser) and the only thing available is my mom's shiseido cleanser that even she is scared to use bc the ph is fucking TEN but I have nO OTHER CHOICE I hATE THIS
600 2018-03-01 22:49:12 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
601 2018-03-01 22:49:03 The industry gets hundreds of billions in subsidies. Unsure whether that’s relevant... rising oil prices r consistent with any republican presidents
602 2018-03-01 22:48:59 Is oil involved in any way with the placement of these windmills?
603 2018-03-01 22:48:48 Sorry to remind you Mrs T destroyed the U.K. Iron & Steel industry not the EU from the late 1970’s to 1980’s and EU funds and the profits from the U.K. Oil industry was used to pay for the record unemployed workers.
604 2018-03-01 22:48:24 @SecretarySonny @USDA @POTUS The RFS works and RINS work. Putting a cap on RINS would devastate the ag economy. Do not allow big oil to devastate rural America. #RFSWorks
605 2018-03-01 22:48:21 It has been confirmed that a loaf of bread is now trading higher than Bitcoin and Crude Oil combined ! #sellsell #bullsh$tmarket
606 2018-03-01 22:48:20 الصيادلية يا ريت يردوا، عايزة:
- spirino lactone 4% gel
- glycolic acid body shower gel
- glycolic & salycic acid chemcial exfoliator for my face
- an emulsifying oil cleanser or a component that turns oil to foam when mixed with water.  
منين اقدر اجيبهم؟
607 2018-03-01 22:48:20 Something hot..drop of oil i think is the remedy..check it out first tho
608 2018-03-01 22:48:13 Because naming a National Parks Highway after the person taking away chunks of National Parks for the benefit of oil companies makes so much sense.  I hope that doesn't happen!

610 2018-03-01 22:48:06 Your own oil earnings what do you do with it?
611 2018-03-01 22:48:06 Olive oil and syringing...
612 2018-03-01 22:48:03 Apply coconut oil it works wonders
613 2018-03-01 22:47:55 so basically oil, soy, more soy, even more soy?
614 2018-03-01 22:47:46 This is true, the polar ice melts and these create new trade routes. And the greed for money and for oil are human's unreasonableness. A tragic and sad situation for cetaceans, the mankind is totally disrespectful to any other species
615 2018-03-01 22:47:36 what lotion do you use? Drop some oil in there and it'll work wonders (coconut, rose, etc).
616 2018-03-01 22:47:35 Sometimes I wonder how we re still considered the greatest nation in Africa just because we have oil
617 2018-03-01 22:47:23 @POTUS @SecretarySonny @EPAScottPruitt a RIN cap is not a win=win for anyone, the #RFSWorks if you want lower RIN price, grant an RVP waiver for E15! Simple supply and demand will bring down RIN prices! Ag economy is not strong, unlike BIG oil economy!
618 2018-03-01 22:47:14 #DidYouKnow 
Black HP printer ink costs roughly 1,400 times as much as crude oil, gallon for gallon.
619 2018-03-01 22:47:07 If our government was smart, and they are not, we'd have a trade deal with China and India, instead Mr dressup insults both of them.  But he doesn't care about oil or wed be refining our own gasoline in new Brunswick, it's not a priority for them, they'd rather we produced 0
620 2018-03-01 22:47:00 I thank God for castor oil cos Arsenal are tryna have me looking like Zidane
621 2018-03-01 22:46:56 What's your stance on olive oil?
622 2018-03-01 22:46:54 Oh no we’re not ugly at all,we look drop dead amazing,but we’re not definitely wealthy for sure,It hurts me to pay 34$ to change my car’s oil 
623 2018-03-01 22:46:46 Psalms 55:21
 “The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.” 

This applies to a lot of people out there. Be careful.
624 2018-03-01 22:46:41 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
625 2018-03-01 22:46:36 Virgin coconut oil.
626 2018-03-01 22:46:30 Coconut oil helped me!
627 2018-03-01 22:46:25 I'd love the wash to 82 cause that would mean #oil 55 test 
628 2018-03-01 22:46:22 The anti-capitalist overtones aside, that's accurate, if perhaps incomplete, no? Koch brothers money is in oil refining and at $50+ a barrel, US is a net exporter. Even a small drop in demand could wipe out 90% of their wealth.
629 2018-03-01 22:46:20 And I assume you weren't a cog in the Big Oil machine like shyster Pruitt! If only we could have you back! We need protections in place for our fragile environment. Thank you for your service, Judith Enck!
630 2018-03-01 22:46:17 If you have acne and haven't included tea tree oil into your routine wyd?
631 2018-03-01 22:45:57 We call it Baba Dudu
632 2018-03-01 22:45:57 can't resist: also LOL at the Oil trading a scoring winger in Hall and then and signing Lucic to replace him. That is a monster fail
633 2018-03-01 22:45:33 how do I find out. how many oil pipe line leaks we have had in North America?
634 2018-03-01 22:45:30 お気をつけて。
635 2018-03-01 22:45:25 Haven’t seen reporting on this, but #steeltariffs will be bad news for oil and gas drillers. Each new long lateral needs ~200 tons of steel
636 2018-03-01 22:45:24 I happen to remember Studebakers from when I was a kid. AND, in the late fifties, I had a salmon color Edsel...a beautiful automobile. My first? a golden Corvair Monza, which was terrific (until it eventually began to leak oil).
637 2018-03-01 22:45:20 Check your Transmission oil today.
638 2018-03-01 22:45:09 You know what’s not fun to clean up? Olive oil. That’s what.
639 2018-03-01 22:45:04 Bill got my oil change for $20 and I'm so happy I'll have $30 now instead of $3 for the next two weeks 
640 2018-03-01 22:45:03 أريدك ان تبقى حين تقرر الرحيل
641 2018-03-01 22:45:03 Why can't you appreciate D.C. has the most ethnically diverse drop-out population in the country?!?!
642 2018-03-01 22:44:58 Targeted tariffs,eg, on Chinese steel will be very helpful. A nation essentially only creates wealth through mining, manufacturing, agriculture. Mining includes oil&gas, manufacturing includes software. Any higher consumer prices will be worth it. Our fellow citizens need jobs.
643 2018-03-01 22:44:57 I never really noticed much difference when I did, so I don't bother.  I do, however, add a bit of oil since that reduces the likelihood of it boiling over when I have my back turned.  (It's a lot less likely with rice pasta: the gluten in wheat pasta is the big culprit.)
644 2018-03-01 22:44:40 j'aime bien l'utilisation des boss dans ce jeu parce qu'ils ont compris que c'est de la merde les boss dans Sonic du coup ils essayent juste d'en faire des surprenants et diversifiés après t'as quand même des gros ratés genre Oil Ocean 2
645 2018-03-01 22:44:28 live the oil experiment rm
646 2018-03-01 22:44:26 @narendramodi Teach Maldives a lesson. Ask one of our ship containers to pour some crude oil on their beaches and let it look like an accident. This should be our line of thinking. Hopefully, they would get the message.
647 2018-03-01 22:44:18 Coconut oil works great
648 2018-03-01 22:44:11 Love it we are a proud unique people we should invite them down put them in a set of oil skins and take them out on the North Atlantic for a few days lol
649 2018-03-01 22:44:03 Bake those bad boys with a little oil and salt and pep
650 2018-03-01 22:43:54 We do basically nothing to this car. Oil change, tires, brakes. Done. Runs like a champ. I love Honda’s for that.
651 2018-03-01 22:43:39 Got my baby an oil change and wash today...  
652 2018-03-01 22:43:39 Got paranoid about how squeaky my bed is so for the past half hour I’ve been melting coconut oil into the frame of my bed 
653 2018-03-01 22:43:23 Spot on mate. Champs League and extra tv money isnt fair on the rest but that's ok of course. Oil money or glory hunters dont see a difference personally.
654 2018-03-01 22:43:13 Parsley and chives work well, with butter. Thyme, garlic, olive oil is very good too. Or a very finely chopped (red) onion in mash, then leave it for a couple of minutes to soften in the mash.
655 2018-03-01 22:43:12 They fry in peanut oil... Never been there as it is a death trap for one of my children!

658 2018-03-01 22:42:59 nothing new. big oil jumps the price of gas during the summer every year. just the stock holders little present to themselves. every year. summer, holidays, whenever the hell they want to.
659 2018-03-01 22:42:52 Yes!! That’s about how useful vegetable oil is
660 2018-03-01 22:42:42 So cannabis oil is legal now!! I'll take it!!
661 2018-03-01 22:42:35 Police are reporting a single vehicle crash on Oil Heritage Rd between Langbank Line and Bentpath Line in #OilSprings. #slont
662 2018-03-01 22:42:27 I don’t think you are very informed on Canadian oil  sir, I would go as far as saying you are ignorant on the facts and the progress being made. Again, Canadian oil will be pulled from the ground for generations to come. Pipelines are the safest way done properly
663 2018-03-01 22:42:27 It's not the only boost, nor has anyone to said it is. But demonstrably in terms of 'new' entrants to the 9 clearly defined 'megaclubs' (UEFA pres definition), the three new ones are CFC, MCFC & PSG, all oil financed.
664 2018-03-01 22:42:13 That’s how my mom does it. She blends the red onion with the tomatoes and pepper, adds white onions & spices to oil, than the purée, and then the paste, meat, than the broth, and then she lets it simmer.

I love this verse. It’s in the Bible for a reason and it’s not because God is into fashion. Nor is it because he desires us to constantly walk around with anointing oil upon our heads.  #deeper

676 2018-03-01 22:40:43 @SenatorLankford  Given your limited understanding of economics, before you congratulate Trump on his tariff plan, remember higher cost steel & aluminum means higher prices for farm machines, oil field pipe and drill bits and aircraft engines and parts.

686 2018-03-01 22:39:22 Snow is only a sign of weather instability in oddball areas like that.  the mountains are always cold,  they need moisture to make snow,  a warmer mediterranean provides that moisture.

China has the means to compete, but they lack the mineral and material resources to be able to conduct business and trade.
They need partners with raw materials and oil.

693 2018-03-01 22:38:13 What if we let you keep your guns but stop selling ammo? That works too, then you can oil your penis replacements all you want!
694 2018-03-01 22:38:04 That was my room. I then bought a loft bed and that oil filled radiator. Huge difference
695 2018-03-01 22:37:59 I told my parents to. Because when they did our first free oil change, they didn’t put the cap on all the way & it blew my moms motor up on her brand new car  and we had to pay for it to be fixed.
696 2018-03-01 22:37:58 How about massive fines for the slaughter of birds and bats Anthony? We do with oil companies already so there's legal precedent. Make fines bad enough that they pull the turbines out of the ground themselves.
697 2018-03-01 22:37:39 Good for the oil industry. Or is that the plan?
698 2018-03-01 22:37:08 The pipe has been sitting in Canada  since 2006 (bush)made the deal and you already paid for it it’s been rusting for years Obama stopped it which was the wright thing to do why would you build a pipeline down to the gulf a sell our oil to China we can do that

703 2018-03-01 22:36:48 Nothing is cooler than when your parent gives you a free car, even if he says there's an oil leak and the gas gauge doesn't work.
704 2018-03-01 22:36:48 Ive seen with my own eyes the death culvert spewing red shit into the Athabasca River. Its been there my whole life 40+ and is still going no doubt. I was on a fishing trip with my dad. It used to be Syncrude Canada Ltd until they sold it to US. It is #2 biggest in world for oil
705 2018-03-01 22:36:47 They have also been involved with every oil slick around the world in cleaning up the marine life. PETA has gone to far. Sea World has changed things for the better and getting a bad rap.

710 2018-03-01 22:36:06 Goat cheese? Lots of oil, fish, lamb? That’s the Mediterranean diet I’ve heard of. Plus you say diet like it’s what Americans are trying...no?
711 2018-03-01 22:35:47 Jnab ap samja do wo kia keh rahy hein? Kis ne menga kia he oil price Zardari ny ya Imran ny ya MQM walo ny ya kisi aur ny?
712 2018-03-01 22:35:43 instant oil change #vavoline this guy is awesome lol
713 2018-03-01 22:35:37 Sad but seems true.  There was a method to the madness in watching the Super Major oil companies one by one sell their projects and get out of Canada (Shell, Marathon, Statoil, etc.) Tax advantages are better south of the 49th Parallel and access to tidewater. Don't blame 'em!
714 2018-03-01 22:35:36 I love my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! Honestly, check them out, they're amazing!
715 2018-03-01 22:35:21 Wrong wrong wrong, oil has been climbing steadily and yet a lot of the companies who had investment plans in Canada are saying out loud and in the open that the regulations are what's killing their business plans, and all the obstacles for pipelines
716 2018-03-01 22:35:19 When America finds out you have oil
717 2018-03-01 22:35:17 So thy want blood over oil. This is war for oil understand
718 2018-03-01 22:35:14 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
719 2018-03-01 22:35:04 #DidYouKnow 
Mayonnaise is made from oil and eggs.
720 2018-03-01 22:35:02 Same here, brother. I think a lot of us use social media to release steam. 
721 2018-03-01 22:34:43 Beard oil. Will help protect and smooth/ nourish your skin to get rid of the new beard itch.
722 2018-03-01 22:34:39 BEHOLD the faces of those DESPERATE for political power, but they lack Character, Capacity & Competence

ACCIDENTAL Leaders who depend on OIL from NIGER DELTA, because they are so MYOPIC

They don't think beyond oil. They are the reason that Northern Nigeria is under developed.
723 2018-03-01 22:34:36 Now I'm bargaining sexual favors for an oil change. The sex is gonna happen anyway but I really do need my oil changed
724 2018-03-01 22:34:31 This Ukraine gov't was installed & weaponized by Obama - arming even Nazis. The area of conflict is Donbass, which has huge oil & gas reserves that a John Kerry-Heinz family & Joe Biden linked firm has the drilling rights to: see Burisma Holdings (offshore based in Cyprus).
725 2018-03-01 22:34:30 Ha it’s like the snake oil salesman from 1880!
726 2018-03-01 22:34:19 I snort-laughed.
727 2018-03-01 22:34:03 "But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil." ~Psalms 92:10 #Bible
728 2018-03-01 22:34:02 Great news a few Canadians will save a couple bucks going to the lake. How about the billions of dollars our economy is losing because we can’t get our oil to market. Why not spend some time on that.
729 2018-03-01 22:33:53 Its not matter of B asad its matter of Europe n American  who r killing pepl think deeply n go to root cause .thy want to occupy oil
730 2018-03-01 22:33:49 Niles, that just sounds like oil wrestling. I don't think I'm ready for that.
731 2018-03-01 22:33:44 its coconut oil :D (whatsapp)
732 2018-03-01 22:33:35 Sippin oil got it in my cup and my wax pen YONG - @DieselKenevil
733 2018-03-01 22:33:28 I ended up getting coconut oil and there is literally not a crevice on my body that is not drenched in it. I'm going to sleep with it in my hair too.
734 2018-03-01 22:33:19 Natural selection, in a few years the fatties will become extinct and solve our oil crysis..#dinosaurbacon
735 2018-03-01 22:33:08 Let's get those pipelines build in Canada so that Canadian refineries can process Canadian oil, and put Canadians back to work.  That will make the world go round in the Great White North!
736 2018-03-01 22:33:00 I had a dream Jack in the box started making truffle oil packets for their tacos.

738 2018-03-01 22:32:52 A bread machine. Otherwise known as an oven. The purists would frown upon my using a mixer and a dough hook.  500g flour, 300ml H2O, 7g yeast, 5g salt and 25g lard or olive oil is my default mix. That’s pizzas, flat breads, dough balls and all sorts. I rarely make loaves.
739 2018-03-01 22:32:48 Today: I bought new pants, got an oil change, paid rent, went grocery shopping, made food, washed my bedding, walked my dog, bathed my dog, and now I have no energy to take a shower. Lolol, go figure. #adulting
740 2018-03-01 22:32:44 I love coming home i have my cats and my coconut oil, moisturizer and chipotle 
741 2018-03-01 22:32:39 exposed oil heater makes you rowdy
742 2018-03-01 22:32:20 frankly I'm confused with oil atm, but maybe its just from travelling so much, these ticos keep stealing my brain power with their crazy driving ways
743 2018-03-01 22:32:12 The Oatly barista stuff with the palm oil and stabilisers makes it foam great. But making almond milk/regular oat milk in house always vastly cheaper anyway, so we do that.
744 2018-03-01 22:32:11 US is eating his lunch on oil production.
745 2018-03-01 22:32:06 No no no. I think this "well-oiled machine" of an administration is due for an oil change.

Thank you, thank you.

Don't forget to tip your waitress.
746 2018-03-01 22:32:03 I do not agree with your priority list. I think money likes stability more than changes in taxes and regulation. The cause of the lower investment is partly the continued oil slump and instability.
747 2018-03-01 22:31:58 Ok here’s the deal...live in the middle of nowhere, it’s snowing hard, well below freezing with a wind chill of minus something ridiculous, the gauge on the heating oil level is broken and yes you’ve guessed it, we’ve run out of oil and can’t get anymore for a week...brrrrr
748 2018-03-01 22:31:42 Peru to enable military to protect oil pipeline from vandals: officials: LIMA (Reuters) - Peru plans to declare the country's sole oil…
749 2018-03-01 22:31:40 $CRR worth a gander against market action today.  50% short, oil industry related.  In 8c dte 15 for 15
750 2018-03-01 22:31:22 If US tariffs steel and aluminum Canada should just sell to China. At the same time we as Canadians should Stop oil from being shipped to US. China will buy it from Canada also. Don’t poke a friendly dog to much or it’ll turn on you. Canada survives anything
751 2018-03-01 22:31:11 if you do nothing else with a quesadilla, oil + salt is a killer combo to take it up a level. it’s how i always make my 3 y/o a quesadilla for lunch now
752 2018-03-01 22:31:10 Peanuts are super healthy no doubt .. but shop bought peanut butters and similar products contain palm oil and that is linked to palm plantations replacing forests :( not so good for Mother Earth .. so traditional peanut Chutney powder is great option 
753 2018-03-01 22:31:09 Same reason any retail supplier wld have to sell on AMZN.  They're free to tell AMZN "no", but AMZN is biggest & fastest (only?) growing customer, so telling AMZN "no" would probably be a bad idea.  Same thing here w/CNY oil.  China's been mvg mkt share to those selling in CNY
754 2018-03-01 22:31:06 Any word on the flamethrower sale?
755 2018-03-01 22:31:05 Time to take a page out of Harper’s playbook and talk about sending less oil to the US and more to China.
756 2018-03-01 22:30:59 Retail price wise—super high quality organic oats at say .30/oz (which is crazy high but let’s go with it) vs almonds which  is .78/oz. stabilisers for barista version  shouldn’t be that much or the palm oil.
757 2018-03-01 22:30:59 Sorry Phil, it sounds like you are unfamiliar with the technology in use.  The oil sands is being produced quite efficiently these days via in-situ methods and mining.
758 2018-03-01 22:30:28 OIL DIFF: 2.94 -> 2.99
759 2018-03-01 22:30:24 Just saw a church called Oil of Joy Ministries. Very interesting.
760 2018-03-01 22:30:23 Gotta get my oil and circuit boards changed nice laughing at ya
761 2018-03-01 22:30:21 2018 Africa SME Roundtable:

762 2018-03-01 22:29:53 My oil need to change againnnn 
763 2018-03-01 22:29:52 are you doing keto? Coz otherwise it's adding on fat. Also, i keep things simple. Black coffee with 1 tbsp MCT oil and blend it in. (stevia can be added)
764 2018-03-01 22:29:41 Now Mr. President. We just need a border tax on oil and the whole country will boom.
765 2018-03-01 22:29:40 Witch hazel as a toner works so well & rose hip oil works great for moisturizer + acne scars. If ur down for medication, spironolactone is a life saver for me
766 2018-03-01 22:29:34 Casually lathering myself in coconut oil cause my skin has been A MESS, it’s so ashy. But I went overboard and now the bathroom floor is slippery and I just fell like sideways into the bathtub. Pretty sure I’ve broken a rib. But I’m so silky smooth, it was worth it.
767 2018-03-01 22:29:28 Nuclear winter caused by burning oil fields is my personal favorite
768 2018-03-01 22:29:19 Why do the oil sector suppliers have to accept payment in CNY? Why can't they just say no to CNY?
769 2018-03-01 22:28:44 SRS THO boys love their trucks so much. Like anytime Brad and I get an oil change done for his truck he is watching through the glass intensely
770 2018-03-01 22:28:43 @TamikaButler “The low income communities are often where you can have a factory, or drill oil.” #shiftstreets #shiftingtowardsequality
771 2018-03-01 22:28:34 Don’t do that....please      We could end up becoming an independent country and your country would never ever get their hands on our oil again 
772 2018-03-01 22:27:54 Try a different medium of drawing like pastels or oil pastels or paint ooooorrrrrr try painting or drawing with nature like use blue berries juice or a leaf as textile
773 2018-03-01 22:27:36 My father travels with his blessed olive oil. I feel like your mom and my dad would get along.
774 2018-03-01 22:27:34 City are an advertising hoarding for Abu Dhabi  and the Emirates.  They need tourism for when the oil dries up.  They need a successful team to promote the tourism trade via City advertising Emirates. Cheaper then tv advertising throughout the world.
775 2018-03-01 22:27:26 Oh. And my hubs knows I'm reading this book for review, he got me a gift on the way home

An essential oil soap I absolutely love.

Take THAT people who think autistics feel nothing. Jerks.
776 2018-03-01 22:27:23 Are you kidding me, Canadian provinces are actively fighting each other on oil, natural gas, alcohol, whatever planet are you living on. Quebec obstructs pipelines left and right as well
777 2018-03-01 22:27:17 What's your preferred frying oil?
778 2018-03-01 22:27:13 Just got tea tree oil in my eye. Omg the pain 
779 2018-03-01 22:26:59 mixing w/ a high heat oil seems to work too
780 2018-03-01 22:26:58 Good evening all, OK so we have been a little quiet and hope to change all that. A new website going live soon, many more products including 500mg & 1000mg liquids, Full Spectrum Oral Dropper tinctures from   250mg to 3,000mg, CBD Capsules 5mg 10mg, 1gram 60% and 80% Pure CBD oil
781 2018-03-01 22:26:42 @Math_lfc was rite obsessed by lpool now city ,turning it around .. LEMON  how much is oil  hahahah game set and match 
782 2018-03-01 22:26:40 You’d consider nemestnikov, a first rounder, another potential first rounder and two very capable prospects bleh? I don’t think it will even be a rebuild like the oil.
783 2018-03-01 22:26:36 Vanskelig for meg som forbruker å forstå hvorfor butikkene gjør dette. Ligger det noe mer bak? Prøver de å skape et bilde av at det faktisk er konkurranse i Norge, for å hindre at opinionen ikke krever at man deler opp markedet? Politikerne bør vurdere å ta en "Standard Oil".
784 2018-03-01 22:26:25 before marriage: i haven’t slept in days, just filled up my tank using quarters, hope no one sees me drinking this java monster

after marriage: i honestly think the oil diffuser helps us sleep better. is this a good brand of almond milk? hey i gotta get home to water my plants
785 2018-03-01 22:25:48 Totally. All that trash that's been washing ashore for years? That's our underwater drone defense grid! And you thought those offshore windmills and oil drilling rigs were for energy? No way! We're protected, Vlad, so sell your tired fearmonger elsewhere!
786 2018-03-01 22:25:41 わーいしつもんみっつ！ありがとうございます！
787 2018-03-01 22:25:35 Oil money? Arsenal have 8 more points than Burnley!

789 2018-03-01 22:25:23 Elite interests are balkanizing Ukraine and opening old wounds amongst Ukrainians for elite interests in the oil/resources under the Caspian Sea and the U.S. desire to cut Russia/Iran/Syria out of the picture. Ukrainian citizens will not benefit one bit from any of this.
790 2018-03-01 22:25:20 ok so i got caster oil a week ago but i havent used it yet
791 2018-03-01 22:24:52 stop putting coconut oil on your face. 
i repeat: STOP PUTTING COCONUT OIL ON YOUR FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
792 2018-03-01 22:24:50 How much does America really care about President's unsteady behavior? A little, I guess. Much more important is that gasoline is cheap, jobs are plentiful, inflation is low. Just spent four days in Carlsbad, NM. Oil boom occurring, just like in seven other US regions.
793 2018-03-01 22:24:45 Oil money or not I’m a Liverpool fan and if jr  Ewing wants to buy us a league title let him off , life moves on , progression is way forward no matter who signs the Cheques . Players are bigger than clubs so let the owners pay out what it costs .

810 2018-03-01 22:22:00 I recall reading about a hypothetical H bomb the size of a large oil tanker that would remain submerged in the pacific and basically end all life if detonated
811 2018-03-01 22:21:59 Folks I think his "wall" isn't the moronic one he wants to have built on our southern border..

It's the one he is building around the entire country in terms of business. Tariffs on metals/solar. Next will be energy like coal or oil. 

There, no one wants to do business with us.

815 2018-03-01 22:20:58 I look back on my Profs at #SFU from early 70s & think wow, they were ahead of their time in so many fields.  Warnings: biodiversity, ozone layer, UV, cancers, exposure to chem, diets, & a comment I recall, "you can't burn billions of litres of oil and expect nothing will happen"
816 2018-03-01 22:20:50 The hair is fake, nails fake, eye lashes fake, eye colour fake! Some with fake breasts! Fake buts but you say you want to marry a Real man! you need 37 bottles of anointing oil my sister!  - AJ

823 2018-03-01 22:19:28 Dr. Adnan: it is self evident that we will see much more investment in East Asian refineries & storage. The key will be to see to what extent can we keep oil demand going in those countries. #OOTT @ColumbiaUEnergy

839 2018-03-01 22:17:19 For $30 a year the @NRA will send you a free magazine. For $65 a year, @AAAnews will send you a free magazine, and provide roadside assistance. Triple A is a seemingly far better deal since the NRA won't come to your home and oil your weapon.

840 2018-03-01 22:17:16 The bus smash of toxic socialism and a tenfold increase in the price of oil which sent inflation soaring globally were behind Britain's problems in the 70's.  Britain was and remains a very short-termite economy which is poison for any real long-term growth planning
841 2018-03-01 22:17:13 The Russian Times wanted to interview everyone opposed to fracking a few years ago. Hate fracking due to impacts on groundwater supply & dislike oil industry in CA. Told RT no interview as they were trying to put untrue words in our mouth & we could fight our own battles.
842 2018-03-01 22:17:04 Hi Amy! If you loved the Blood Orange + White Pepper Scrub, we’d recommend our new Lemon & Sage Satin-Skin Body Polish w/ Shea Butter & Coconut Oil.

848 2018-03-01 22:15:22 It would be extremely difficult to convince anyone on the planet that Donald Trump and the USA isn`t for oil and coal and all things bad for the environment and the planet.

Coalition officials where in communication will Russian counterparts before, during, & after sttack. There is a lot more.
851 2018-03-01 22:15:03 Haykel on Russia cooperation: Gulf states may feel strongly about Russia's role in Syria but they can disentangle that from oil policy. #CGEPevents
852 2018-03-01 22:14:48 Exactly. And in many cases extracted oil is shipped overseas, so we're damaging the environment in our country so other countries can use an unecessary limited resource that should be outdated by now.
853 2018-03-01 22:14:42 I’m on about me liking it you 

You were already 2-0 up when I liked it. Get a grip. Always talking about other things rather than your own club. What’s the price of Oil these days?
854 2018-03-01 22:14:36 The second time in a week where I realize I've become so comfortable with Nicolle and many other rational republicans that I may be watching something that's against my best interests.  Matt Schlapp issue...he's been an a** forever; Condi Rice, Iraq/torture/russian oil interests.

858 2018-03-01 22:14:11 Aviation fuel cheaper than Olive Oil! So not gonna happen.
859 2018-03-01 22:14:10 I didn't complain at all, merely pointed out a fact. And I don't know about getting dominated, since the oil money arrived we've won more than both Chelsea and City...

861 2018-03-01 22:13:37 We're talking about an oil baron owner who (over) drafted Johnny Manziel simply to sell jerseys to pay his fines for defrauding small businesses and when that wasn't enough he changed the best unis in the NFL into the worst unis just to sell more jerseys.
862 2018-03-01 22:13:34 You may want to check into how much oil the US gets from Canada. Not something that’s talked about much.

865 2018-03-01 22:13:23 Probably water supply issue. Oil or gas fired? If it’s a condenser boiler the condensation outlet to outside could be iced up and blocked.

867 2018-03-01 22:13:02 with exception of American frackers that have halved the price of a barrel of oil putting the Russian ecomony, such as it is on the ropes. Can you imagine the world scene today if oil was at $100 a barrel. Mischief making would be a quaint phrase.

877 2018-03-01 22:11:55 Will you get your FREE oil this month???
878 2018-03-01 22:11:53 I'm sure it would. I just love the smell of the coconut oil and it melts into the skin so beautifully.
879 2018-03-01 22:11:34 Sales of vegan foods are definitely indicating the trend, but that’s not in any way demonstrating more people actually being vegan. My jars of coconut oil and nut butter have the Green V check mark but it’s redundant on a naturally vegan product. Those sales are still included.

881 2018-03-01 22:11:31 You wouldn't be in the EU .. the EU told you that.  you would have had to reapply and accept the Euro.  You wouldn't have austerity because after the oil price drop and removal of Barnett formula you would have been bankrupt

891 2018-03-01 22:10:42 You're going to think I'm crazy but whenever I get sick I cut out sugar completely, take 5 vitamin D pills a day and drink a lot of tumeric. If your throat hurts and you have the means I recommend oil of oregano. I know sound like a hippy but trust me
892 2018-03-01 22:10:41 a funny thing to do is if u put coconut oil in your hair and then go out in the snow to the shed to get some coal your hair will become completely rigid very quickly
893 2018-03-01 22:10:41 All warm here. Plenty of oil. Ordered more today they said they can get it to us Monday but it arrived about 6 this evening which is amazing job by #SweeneyOil
894 2018-03-01 22:10:25 What oil spill? You mean all the oil spills so far from oil exports? Do you mean the 90% of tanker traffic in Canadian waters that is actually US tankers?
895 2018-03-01 22:10:25 I'm getting my oil changed and there's a kid here with his new truck getting his first oil change and the GLARE he's giving the workers while they work... I hope I'm loved/protected as much as boys love/protect their trucks

898 2018-03-01 22:10:08 Veg cooked in extra virgin olive oil contain more phenol antioxidants as they move from the oil to the veg so need to roast or sauté veg in oil. A higher fat content can also aid appetite control, feelings of fullness #dietitansunite
899 2018-03-01 22:09:51 Also the limit of THC 0.3% excludes every single LP CBD product. So even children with seizure disorders using high CBD oil will still be paying tax. Extremely out of touch and makes no sense. #DontTaxMedicine

911 2018-03-01 22:08:41 Canada as a whole should be in the same boat as Norway but, your politicians continue to allow my country to be your only customer and, you continue to buy foreign oil, which is stupid.

916 2018-03-01 22:08:00 Yep. I'm not vegan - but love vegetables. Especially in a curry or roasted in oil. Does 'burforders' mean you are in Burford, Oxfordshire? Just wondered as I'm not far away fr there. If you are, bet that main road down the hill is slippy tonight!

931 2018-03-01 22:06:00 Good god, your ignorance is frightening. Venezuela collapsed because the oil price declined significantly. There is no possible way they could have survived with a non-diversified economy.

934 2018-03-01 22:05:09 They really help dull the shine. However, one side effect, you can be the cleanest person but you will think you must have soaked your face in a vat of oil at some point, based on how it looks when you're done. You haven't, haven't & it's just doing it's job.
935 2018-03-01 22:05:08 Factoid: From late 2007 to late 2017, oil prices fell from over $100 a barrel to under $50 a barrel. That’s a reduction of 50 percent! #Factoid #Trivia

World strategic oil reserves total 4 billion barrels.
World oil usage is 35 billion barrels per year.

943 2018-03-01 22:03:53 Gosh, an investigation... Must mean someone is interested in the consumers interest... So after 100 years plus, oil companies will be accused of collusion & controlling supply to maximise profit - I'm shocked

961 2018-03-01 22:01:46 If it were independent, Scotland would have around £70 billion in trade annually from its oil and gas, we'll struggle by somehow. And you seem to talk a lot about what we give to the EU, but not what we get in return, including collective bargaining power.
962 2018-03-01 22:01:38 Did you know that the Earth has roughly 50 years of oil left? Isn't that messed up? Millions of years for the earth to create oil, and in roughly 150 years, humans will have drilled and used it all. That's fucked
963 2018-03-01 22:01:27 Ryan came and got my car while I was at work today, changed me oil and cleaned my whole car inside and out....  my god I love that man

966 2018-03-01 22:01:13 We are better able to absorb the red lycopene colour from Processed tomatoes (tomato canned, purée, paste) than raw tomato but adding extra virgin olive oil to both is even better. Go Italian meals! #dietitiansunite

976 2018-03-01 22:00:31 I truly am happy for him and hope she doesn't end up like Olive Oil 
977 2018-03-01 22:00:31 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-03-01, is 6.7.
978 2018-03-01 22:00:29 OIL DIFF: 2.97 -> 3.02
979 2018-03-01 22:00:27 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
980 2018-03-01 22:00:21  u crazy girl. but castor oil nasty tho.. it’s worth the try wen u due
981 2018-03-01 22:00:16 March 01, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
982 2018-03-01 22:00:13 In the sense that someone made one? Yes.
983 2018-03-01 22:00:13 New breaks and rotor and oil change but for to get car inspected so that’ll be next week and god damn do I still kinda feel like shit gonna sleep til work tomorrow
984 2018-03-01 22:00:03 Lol. Oil people in Nigeria is like olorun o'nije
985 2018-03-01 21:59:59 Nonsense. WD-40 can be used for all sorts of applications the "legal experts" won't let us put on the label. Big Oil just wants you to think it's only good for "certain uses" so you'll buy all their specialty gun oils and chain oils and cooking oils, etc.
986 2018-03-01 21:59:56 THERES A WOMEN WORKING AT MY OIL STOP. DO YOU KNOW HOW EXCITED IM FOR THAT!!!!!!!
987 2018-03-01 21:59:47 Since 2007 #NC created 34,000 jobs from clean energy & solar panels. This reduced #NC coal, oil demand. Trump imposed a 30% tariff. Effectively killing jobs. Next week he will impose a 25% on steel & aluminum. How many jobs will be affected? #nc08 #nc8.
988 2018-03-01 21:59:33 The oil industry seems to take a let's burn down the house on our way out the door approach.Dare say it all happens through a Faberge doll set of linked companies with deflected liability.
989 2018-03-01 21:59:32 Don’t use combs, comb with your fingers and Air dry. Washing it with garlic and using castro oil to moisturize
990 2018-03-01 21:59:31 Wholesale price of oil 7% down yet petrol prices still go up rip off britain
991 2018-03-01 21:59:29 Hmmm... "penetrating oil" I stand corrected. Still, in the long run, penetrants are probably not good for guns.
992 2018-03-01 21:59:28 Oil motivated...
993 2018-03-01 21:59:22 From the reports I've seen this has already happened we are now the United States the number one oil producer in the world thank you and God bless America and God bless America!
994 2018-03-01 21:59:13 Some days I feel like a fiercely independent individual...and some days I get my oil changed and realize I have no idea how to pop the hood on my own vehicle when asked.
995 2018-03-01 21:59:01 Maybe they want to disrupt more than oil in Canada. Maybe their goal is to disrupt our economy.
996 2018-03-01 21:58:44 Adding extra virgin olive oil to colourful salads means we are better able to absorb colourful carotenoid antioxidant  pigments which are fat soluble #dietitansunite
997 2018-03-01 21:58:37 @ThierryHenry on this beard oil shine #ARSMCI
998 2018-03-01 21:58:31 Senator, there is no oil and gas off the shore of South Carolina. Your wasting your time.

You need to fix, "if you like your insurance you can keep your insurance!"
999 2018-03-01 21:58:15 I don't recall any Bojangles in Pixburgh....
1000 2018-03-01 21:58:12 Getting my oil change now 
1001 2018-03-01 21:57:48 Agreed--looks like a weed when wilted, but so tasty with olive oil, salt & garlic. That is why I cook and eat out very seldom--only while traveling
1002 2018-03-01 21:57:45 Information is more valuable than gold, oil, or any currency. Those who control Information, Control the world.
1003 2018-03-01 21:57:40 @EPAScottPruitt   
Hey Scott Pruitt, when you're done tearing up the Sacred American Indian lands to drill for oil and Frack for gas maybe you can read up on clean energy. 
Oh Not enough $ in clean air & water for your Corporate friends/Putin ?

1004 2018-03-01 21:57:22 Hi Joseph, are you referring to our Lemon Lotion? The lemon oil and extract we use does not lighten, but it brightens the radiance of dull skin. It rejuvenates tiered-looking skin and helps skin stay healthy and vibrant.
1005 2018-03-01 21:57:21 This.
1006 2018-03-01 21:57:07 The word salad is from “Sal” or salt - the romans salted their veg to make them taste better and used extra virgin olive oil to #DietitiansUnite
1007 2018-03-01 21:56:58 Yes yes Pen,  the  trade body for the oil & gas industry doesn't understand what they're talking about, but you've got it sussed. Phew.  We can relax with our future safe in the hands of you, Theresa, Boris, Nigel 'n' Jezza.  Or not.
1008 2018-03-01 21:56:52 Pogba will leave, so will martial, mata aswell, rashfords already a waste because of Mourinho, de gea gone to Madrid, lingards your only hope, looks like you’ll have to spend a bit of that oil money you lot are owned by, not to mention the 5 banks your partnered with.
1009 2018-03-01 21:56:45 I remember the original saying that these wars were all about the "free flow of oil at market prices". Can't believe they became about the free flow of heroin at market prices 17 years ago. Exactly; why? Control.
1010 2018-03-01 21:56:44 Use a wash cloth with baby shampoo or oil free makeup nothing water proof or oil based
1011 2018-03-01 21:56:29 It's a replay of SDI. They fear the idea of it so much, they will overspend to counteract something that isn't real- yet.

As long as we keep the price of oil/gas down that is.  So begs the question: better to let Chinese get hands on Uzbek gas or Russia.
1012 2018-03-01 21:56:29 Henry on the beard oil 
1013 2018-03-01 21:56:20 Coconut oil from the pantry!
1014 2018-03-01 21:56:17 She probably received some oil money for that recommendation.
1015 2018-03-01 21:55:48 I got my oil changed and Brenda doesn’t sound like an RC Car anymore
1016 2018-03-01 21:55:32 serious question : does anyone have any experience with CBD oil ?
1017 2018-03-01 21:55:25 and you islamophobes think that middle east is bad. can't even go to school in usa without fear of getting shot!!! who really has the BARBARIC society.
#m103 #islamophobia #NRA
1018 2018-03-01 21:55:02 I bought lululemon today instead of getting an oil change and I’m not sorry about it
1019 2018-03-01 21:54:58 Today just happens to be the day everyone decides to go get their oil changed
1020 2018-03-01 21:54:41 Before Levy’s ‘oil money’ AKA cheese room.
1021 2018-03-01 21:54:27 You could be worse off like me-ran out of heating oil will have to wait till next week for delivery-imagine an old period house without oil-will not forget storm Emma .Freezing
1022 2018-03-01 21:54:14 It's not Obama, it's trump. The uranium one has been shown as a nothing burger, trump promised coal and oil the world and put us further behind the rest of the world in sustainable energy and not trump is destroying the rest of the economy with tariffs he was warned would hurt us
1023 2018-03-01 21:54:07 They penciled out pretty well in our first year too. We modified our corn header for 1 yr trial. This header is a good medium for around 200ac a year of oil sunnies
1024 2018-03-01 21:54:04 just found out that in engine oil with two types of viscocity there are tiny little polymer guys that, when heated, uncoil and help oil cling to lubricate the engine. keep up the good work 
1025 2018-03-01 21:54:00 Also from the past:
The Teapot Dome Scandal - secret leasing (Hundreds of thousands $ in bribes) of federal oil reserves by the secretary of the interior, Albert Bacon Fall in the Harding administration.
Trump admin makes Teapot Dome look like Teapot Pimple
Jared $500 million
1026 2018-03-01 21:53:37 We would run out of heating oil in this weather  #freezing
1027 2018-03-01 21:53:36 @SkySportsPL @Carra23 @GNev2 Why is Pep so good? He's just spent 370m NET. Yes NET. You lot just talk utter crap. Honest, does my head in. They are owned by an oil state. Its ruining competition. #ARSMCI #arsenal
1028 2018-03-01 21:53:30 And I'm only pointing it out because I want one.
1029 2018-03-01 21:53:26 Hey @SeaWorld go fuck yourselves turn into a rescue and environmental crisis agency that saves animals from oil spills out of control wildfires 
Save the bees anything except what y'all doin now the them orcas and dolphins
1030 2018-03-01 21:53:15 I can't wait to be able to buy CBD oil and see if it will actually help with my anxiety/depression. I'd rather take something natural then take a prescription that can have so many side effects
1031 2018-03-01 21:53:15 I worked on the Exxon Valdez oil spill lawsuit, unfortunately for the bad guys, when I lived in Los Angeles. Oil companies are probably the most corrupt corporations on Earth. Tillerson has almost single-handedly destroyed the American foreign service. He really is evil.
1032 2018-03-01 21:52:59 today Iran stopped to trade oil in dollars, what you gonna do about that? 

its over..
1033 2018-03-01 21:52:37 AAAAAND i still haven’t got an oil change 
1034 2018-03-01 21:52:34 LMAO
1035 2018-03-01 21:52:22 Watch speed in Nevada!
1036 2018-03-01 21:52:18 Because there are certain Factors the office of the president can't control. The fall of oil price per barrel is good example and the beginning of the nation's challenges. It lead to high cost of goods and commodity, which is beyond any govt. Control. We are peg on the dollars
1037 2018-03-01 21:52:17 You get what you snake oil sell for...
1038 2018-03-01 21:51:53 You guys know that's real, right?
1039 2018-03-01 21:51:10 yeah, but olive oil has a really low smoke point, so its not as good as veggie oil for stuff that needs higher heat. nothing worst than burnt olive oil taste lol.
1040 2018-03-01 21:51:05 #UmagangBalita Diskwentong ibinibigay ng oil companies sa PUV, palalawakin
1041 2018-03-01 21:51:05 Today I caught my cat licking my bottle of olive oil. He gets this from my side of the family.
1042 2018-03-01 21:50:56 He's hurting the Solar Industry. The number of people who will lose jobs in the coming months will devestate communities. It will result in every American paying more for electricity.

We have most of the infrastructure.We have the desire to not rely on oil. Help us.
1043 2018-03-01 21:50:56 In, going to try it. I was just thinking I needed for oil in my diet.
1044 2018-03-01 21:50:28 I really fuckin hate you I’m saying why would your dumbass buy expensive ass coconut oil then complain about coconut oil
1045 2018-03-01 21:50:19 And for some reason belching increases by 100000% when you take fish oil.. you be tasting it every minute
1046 2018-03-01 21:49:52 G me too,  i need some coconut oil & shit.
1047 2018-03-01 21:49:50 Canada exports 410 billion out of 549 billion to u.s. in 2017, we dont build pipelines and landlock our oil, we don't have a trade deal with China, we insulted India, who are we going to sell to and dictate price when we online have one buyer.
1048 2018-03-01 21:49:38 P.S. Plenty of big oil people favor and heavily fund AGW stuff. They love cartelization. Drives out small competitors so they can raise prices.
1049 2018-03-01 21:49:29 .@Adnan1943: We do have to reduce dependence on oil but we also have to continue to develop oil and gas resources and make them cleaner.
1050 2018-03-01 21:49:18 we sure can, when you available?  I actually am native american, cherokee to be exact and I love full moons. how’d you know? oh and I don’t use tea tree oil, but castor and rose oil work wonders!

1053 2018-03-01 21:49:01 You do realize that its not even technically oil? Exactly what I'd expect from a "Snake Penetrant" salesman.
1054 2018-03-01 21:48:52 Until you maggots started throwing oil money around like Chelsea and PSG.
Just remember Citeh were founded in 2008 only.
Manchester City on the other hand were Championship fodder beforehand
1055 2018-03-01 21:48:46 @Rick_Stein loving your Spain trip would love to invite you to visit us in El Perello to try the local olive oil & honey .........yummy! X
1056 2018-03-01 21:48:44 I hate when you take a fish oil capsule and you can taste it on your chest....if that makes sense
1057 2018-03-01 21:48:39 .@Adnan1943 on the challenges of energy transition: The gulf countries face a challenge as the dominance of oil decreases. We don't know when demand will peak, so we must be ready with solutions.
1058 2018-03-01 21:48:36 Chubby!
1059 2018-03-01 21:48:32 Blood Bath & Beyond.
1060 2018-03-01 21:48:28 My brother got my oil changed & rugs and other girly shit for my car 
1061 2018-03-01 21:48:26 I heard Pier 1 Imports to do the same!
1062 2018-03-01 21:48:26 Douse then in olive oil & keep them in the fridge.
1063 2018-03-01 21:48:19 The Patent Pending sticker really sells it.
1064 2018-03-01 21:48:18 get ratio'd, snake oil
@IPM_GS
1065 2018-03-01 21:47:55 Different to the oil money that propelled Chelsea to their success?
1066 2018-03-01 21:47:41 The corruption that began during Yeltsin, has only grown and thrived under Putin. He controls the narrative. Oil/Gas prices and Military exports still control Russia’s economic performance.
1067 2018-03-01 21:47:21 That #NSW is selling Snowy and then most likely spending the money on new oil dependent infrastructure shows @GladysB has no idea and no intention to replace coal with renewables. The funds should be used to invest in wind farms to drive Snowy2 pumps. Should have been condition
1068 2018-03-01 21:47:14 It was yummy - the meat balls were sausages squeezed out the skin and divided, browned in olive oil, add passata, garlic and choice of herbs, cook down, glug in balsamic and throw in cooked pasta, and inhale!! 
1069 2018-03-01 21:47:02 ctfu my fat ass not doing no squats i take hot baths everyday man never took castor oil & i be too lazy for sex now it’s tiring 
1070 2018-03-01 21:46:47 I have coconut oil on all my shirts <<<<<<
1071 2018-03-01 21:46:42 @CondoleezzaRice Must have been a coincidence that Oil began to drop in 2014, following Russian incursions, and damaged the Russian economy.
1072 2018-03-01 21:46:39 Lol it’s just coconut oil. I got some you can apply
1073 2018-03-01 21:46:22 That leaves heat, where the contrast is stark. Just over £1bn is budgeted for the RHI in 2021. Almost all heat is fossil-fired, mostly gas, plus oil, elec. etc. Renewables probably won't be 10% in 2021, and a lot of that is a statistical fiddle. 4/

1075 2018-03-01 21:46:15 Leave it to the #speNDP to turn its back on Alberta, especially her past. It was American money that provided the beginning of getting the oil out of the ground, not Toronto.
1076 2018-03-01 21:45:46 ياشيخ انت متخلف انطم
1077 2018-03-01 21:45:43 What happened to Pop’s stock market today?  And...what is going on Pop’s crude oil?
1078 2018-03-01 21:45:41  Guns are on Hardware aisle next to motor oil
1079 2018-03-01 21:45:36 Because the US is a heavily energy-dependent and consumer-driven economy, the US typically stands to lose the most from higher oil prices and to gain the most from lower oil prices. Oil’s one input among many that’s factored into our inflation and growth expectations.
1080 2018-03-01 21:45:24 Lol use that! I first cut my hair. I listened to my dad and got some wave shit & blue magic grease... did not work at all! I.T broke me out. I just started using natural products. I don’t even use Cantu all the time. I really use tea tree oil lol
1081 2018-03-01 21:45:24 Glad I listened to my intuition and went to the botanica today. I found a free/donation based yoga, meditation and reiki classes. Also, I found sugar daddy oil as I gathered goodies for Ogun and Oshun. Things are about to take off!

1083 2018-03-01 21:45:17 Aren't those the same guys who assured us we'd be up to our pelvises in melt water by now, and oil would never drop below $200...
1084 2018-03-01 21:45:02 Tea tree oil
1085 2018-03-01 21:44:50 seriously! seriously! whoever this is, really hasn't got a clue. it's just plain wrong. the arctic, anatarctic and greeland are all losing ice and sea levels have risen 20cm as a result. why are oil companies wetting themselves that they might get to drill the arctic?

1088 2018-03-01 21:44:14 I do that, but i just crafted tinkerers oil and goblin auto-barber for my kingsbane deck and won a few, prepared it for the coldlight rotation at the same time
1089 2018-03-01 21:44:11 Everyone knows last year after I totaled my car I got an suv, and 2weeks after I get my suv the transmission went... so I’m at the dealership today getting an oil change why is these mfs selling that truck again? I want it back so bad 
1090 2018-03-01 21:44:08 Oil. Natural resources in other countries (extractive corps). Putin’s ego. ?
1091 2018-03-01 21:43:57 Wings n fries.. Lol can remember what kinda wings but they were mediocre.. N the fries were oily AAFFFFF.. Like drencheddd in oil

1096 2018-03-01 21:43:18 Its alright, i don't use it very often. usually when i need to fry something that needs a higher temp than olive oil can handle (like stir fry).
1097 2018-03-01 21:43:18 a few months ago I broke down on the highway, had to change the oil on the side of the road, and had a creepy man stop to check my car and see if I did it right... I mean you still win, but I’ve been there

1101 2018-03-01 21:42:48 Ima be real with y'all. Oiled up women/asses look terrible. Who thought that was a good idea? Who went "maybe if I rubbed some oil on her it'd be better"?? Ain't nothing hot or sexual about shiny, oily ass.
1102 2018-03-01 21:42:47 Amen to this comment! He was a racist and as greedy as any snake oil salesman . 
He had a good rap tho and pulled thousands in to his ultra evangelical creepy christianity.
1103 2018-03-01 21:42:42 When did you start doing that 
City ; since the oil money came
1104 2018-03-01 21:42:42 Oh okay! I mix Tarte’s Maracuja Oil with my foundation anyways to help with hydration so I’ll give it a try! Plus Nars has good concealer.
1105 2018-03-01 21:42:41 Oil money is one thing. More oil money + Pep is another. By far the best team I have seen in years, but makes me loose interest in football.
1106 2018-03-01 21:42:36 Hmm. I have no confidence that old Rex Tillerson's oil company is doing anything that does not advance its agenda of making money. It is not pro-American, but it probably is gearing up for an oil race in the Arctic with Russia as its biggest rival.
1107 2018-03-01 21:42:20 The U.S. oil and gas industry on Thursday slammed President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imported steel, saying the move would kill energy jobs by raising costs for big infrastructure projects.

1112 2018-03-01 21:41:55 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1113 2018-03-01 21:41:46 Have you heard about our amazing Nyarlathotep Essential Oil? It really boosts your health with its dairy-free Deep One!
1114 2018-03-01 21:41:36 This is Tillerson, not Trump.  Tillerson has made a lot of money in Africa in his oil career.

1118 2018-03-01 21:41:20 To all politicians in BC.  We have developed a process that removes all of the asphlatenes from Bitumen and it now floats on top of the water.   Clean-up spills like any other oil.   But this oil is 40% less Co2 emittiong than any other oil.
1119 2018-03-01 21:41:20 I have 500 "locked".  Guess we just have to be patient.
1120 2018-03-01 21:41:18 Why? Gotta get to the oil?
1121 2018-03-01 21:41:16 Last night: 86yo neighbour ran out of oil. She refused to go to friends house or come to come to ours to sit by fire. "I'm not cold" she said "I have 3 heaters & I'm wearing 3 anoraks & 2 pairs of trousers tonight: thankfullyshe has gone to a friends &amp; oil is coming tomorrow
1122 2018-03-01 21:41:12 or sooner. This is really going to affect the oil business. They import a lot of pipe so they are tacking on another 25% to what it already costs for drilling and after that when they need tubing/sucker rods for pump jacks.

1125 2018-03-01 21:40:39 Essential Validation Services has provided clear, precise analysis for almost 500 different essential oils within the Industry! Over 50 companies have benefited from EVS’s lab analysis and online database, where every report is stored along with what company that oil came from.
1126 2018-03-01 21:40:38 Went from a 50$ oil change to a 500$ car fix , but whatever at least it’s fixed & out the way.. i knew it was coming!
1127 2018-03-01 21:40:35 The best way to look at oil is as an inflation input and as a limiting factor on overall economic growth. The higher the price of oil, the higher inflation is likely to be and the slower the economy is likely to grow.

1132 2018-03-01 21:40:15 Yes...it is this leverage point that relatively few investors grasp about the importance of the CNY oil contract.  The permanent reduction in USD's needed can get so big, so fast...right as US funding needs are getting so big, so fast, & the US econ's been so levered for so long.
1133 2018-03-01 21:40:01 Perhaps the Feds could demo that they would really act in future oil spill cases by getting behind this problem by finding and fining owner.

1138 2018-03-01 21:39:41 Or support solar and wind, which would have been able to supply US energy needs by now, had Big Oil not gotten their way for the last 35 years.
1139 2018-03-01 21:39:35 The U.S. oil and gas industry on Thursday slammed President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imported steel, saying the move would kill energy jobs by raising costs for big infrastructure projects.

1143 2018-03-01 21:39:17 totally agree. Think the first thing we need to do is tax all oil gas and companies that made money destroying the environment a 50% tax on profits to fix their destruction.

1148 2018-03-01 21:38:39 Wow! An oil man running the State Dept and now a car salesman could become the next National Security Advisor. Smh

1154 2018-03-01 21:37:50 Hemp Seed Oil
Hemp and cannabis oil both come from the same species of plant, Cannabis sativa. But hemp has been bred through the centuries for use in clothing and oils and this has changed the plant somewhat.
1155 2018-03-01 21:37:48 inother words, they fined the oil investors who think it is just pennies to them.
1156 2018-03-01 21:37:38 Whyyy are there so many people getting an oil change right now  I wanted this to be quick
1157 2018-03-01 21:37:32 It’s crazy!! Got 3 oil heaters on!! Stay safe/warm Guys!!

Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years and its oil is very powerful.
1160 2018-03-01 21:36:52 Me a ticket. I got home, soaking only make the wax sticky. So I ended using my good friend google and found out extra virgin olive oil works
1161 2018-03-01 21:36:50 City were as excellent as we were poor. Something has got to change. Yes oil money has changed the dynamics of the game, no excuse for not playing for the shirt! #afc #gooners

1167 2018-03-01 21:36:25 Take advantage of the whole yr they had w Obama to lock in NAFTA? Lower tax rates so we can compete w US. ? get oil to market by actually  building pipelines? Not screw up India relations and get a trade deal w this vital economy.
1168 2018-03-01 21:36:15 Any RIN cap would have the effect of rewarding bad behavior. These oil refiners refused to blend and now are begging for reprieve.. had they followed the law from day 1 no economic harm would have occurred #RFSWorks
1169 2018-03-01 21:36:11 @PuntingBaron   What time are you looking to post the best oil today Baron ? I may have missed it if you posted earlier. #winner
1170 2018-03-01 21:36:08 Ahh, see now you’re asking the right question! You add extra oil to the pan and then use a spoon to scoop hot oil onto the top so you never flip it.
1171 2018-03-01 21:36:08 @Kroger will also no longer be selling cars, private jets, cocaine, escort services, livestock, and crude oil.  @RawseDubya please take your business elsewhere for these items. #ChangeStartsWithKroger

1174 2018-03-01 21:35:44 1.) The color looks artificial. Don’t ask me how, but it does. 
2.) I’ve never seen meat fried in the oil and then the stew added. It’s normally boiled in a broth that is later added to thin the stew and add depth
3.) The pepper to tomato ratio.

1175 2018-03-01 21:35:36 great news for me!  I need hemp oil to deal with my chronical pains
1176 2018-03-01 21:35:36 The link between carbon dioxide and climate change tells us oil is a weapon of mass environmental destruction. Throwing money at a sector that will cause food shortages in years to come is wrong.
1177 2018-03-01 21:35:33 Use bio oil and coffee scrubs girl
1178 2018-03-01 21:35:30 I need a new moisturiser JFKDKSS I remember seeing this one but I can't remember the name it was a thick gel that turned into oil ? Sorta ?
1179 2018-03-01 21:35:27 The southern voters wanted to get rid of the "elites"touted by Trump whn in fact he filled his cabinet wth all elites.  Ppl believed he got religion, he faked tht to the hilt, he said everythg they wanted to hear the snake oil salesman and they read nothing abt his history, boom!
1180 2018-03-01 21:35:21 Better used as a cold oil for salads or dressing pasta/potatoes/food apparently
1181 2018-03-01 21:34:49 Yesterday I set out to go buy a decent blanket. Instead I bought beard oil
1182 2018-03-01 21:34:44 Same here. Anyway it leaves horrible aftertaste from the palm oil. Gross.
It is produced unethically.

1185 2018-03-01 21:34:23 it’s always really embarrassing when they give you your keys back after an oil change & they start mentioning all the other things you’ve neglected to keep up with on your car like yes i know im irresponsible it’s been this way my whole life i’m sorry ok
1186 2018-03-01 21:34:17 Totally possible to go 100% green, save the world from the worst effects of global warming, but Big Oil takes priority with billions of subsidies being pumped into fossil fuels even as they destroy our climate and any hope for our future.

1192 2018-03-01 21:33:55 Hahaha! Oil rich ones like sunflower seeds etc are best - you can get super cheap bird seed and fat balls (they love those) from places like Wilkos! Bread fills up their stomachs and expands to make them feel full, but they don't actually get any nutrition from it

But glad I got it all under control LMFAO
1208 2018-03-01 21:32:14 The next cocksucker that throws food at me is going to get their asses fucked up with hot oil and metal. I’m not fucking around today and don’t fuck with me.

1216 2018-03-01 21:31:35 Ive been enjoying eating my organic super seeded oatcakes with flax and linseed until I discovered they contain palm oil. Although it claims to be "sustainable" that don't wash. Won't be buying again @NairnsOatcakes can you not find a suitable alternative?

1222 2018-03-01 21:30:53 The trick is not to buy the jarred stuff. Get the actual fermented (thus black) and salted soy beans. Little sugar, Chinese shaoxing rice wine, a little sesame oil. Soak for 15 mins, then mush with a fork.

1229 2018-03-01 21:29:39 Thanks Homebase! I crashed into the back of an oil tanker trying to get to your store.

1231 2018-03-01 21:29:29 Don’t forget a barrel of crude oil which the country depends on till date was $145 in 2015. How much is it now?

1233 2018-03-01 21:29:17 To whoever is exporting U.S. crude oil to Switzerland and filling out the correct final destination on U.S. Customs forms - thank you and you're awesome.
1234 2018-03-01 21:28:54 As much as the world cursed by greedy elite , #Yemen is cursed by it's surrounding neighbors , 

And as much as the world cursed by leaders like Theresa May and @realDonaldTrump, we are ( Arabic world )  cursed by the oil's wealth
1235 2018-03-01 21:28:46 Remember, this oil and gas has been under the surface of your great Province for so long, that it once belonged to the people who lived here before you. How did they make out in the deal? Do they even have clean drinking water to show for it? #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM
1236 2018-03-01 21:28:40 alas, no. Good shout though.

1240 2018-03-01 21:27:57 I was more on the track of body oil, but sure
1241 2018-03-01 21:27:44 Yeah and the oil exec as the Secretary of State. Whoops
1242 2018-03-01 21:27:37 Ok you say this but you just bought $20 oil?? I don’t know about you sometimes
1243 2018-03-01 21:27:34 @foxnation @BretBaier @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump My thoughts on steel tariffs, in case of a national emergency do we want to rely on outside sources or do we make sure we are capable ourselves! Just like oil/gas, self reliance is key! I support tariffs!
1244 2018-03-01 21:27:19 Fair enough! Rub a good amount of salt all over. Then I’d do a simple olive oil, garlic and rosemary marinade for as long as you can. Even throw some lemon in there. You could do a dry hickory/rosemary based rub if you had some lying around. Enjoy!
1245 2018-03-01 21:27:09 i need a full body massage  w/ the baby oil & all
1246 2018-03-01 21:27:05 They put an oil exec as the head of the State Department and we are seeing what a cluster F it's turning out to be.

Now they want to do the same with National Security.
1247 2018-03-01 21:27:00 I don’t watch that trash nor do I buy any of their snake oil.

1251 2018-03-01 21:26:42 Should’ve left this oil change shit up to my dad I feel like I just got, got
1252 2018-03-01 21:26:35 For decades, Aussies paid taxes to fund "investigations" into why there is a petrol "price cycle" bearing NO RELATION to oil cost, refinery charges or exchange rate.
Each time we're told there's no need to worry.
So just keep paying the taxes - the results are heartening. 
1253 2018-03-01 21:26:26 Synthetic, Purity of Synthetic base oil is predictable, 100%
1254 2018-03-01 21:26:24 Not reassuring that our UK gas storage capacity is shit. We produce 43℅,we import rest via Norway/Holland. A 3rd world oil producer?
1255 2018-03-01 21:26:19 I’ll never have to buy fish oil again.
1256 2018-03-01 21:26:19 You could try digging for oil in the basement.

1261 2018-03-01 21:26:01 Yeah “over-spending” has damaged the game definitely, but wouldn’t you be happier if u have “Oil money” in ur life!
Ur blaming the source of the money, but ur not finding a solution.
1262 2018-03-01 21:25:58 The majority of these accomplishments help corporations. they do not help regular Americans like you and me, but I will let you decide. Personally I don't like his school choice plan, or his opening of public lands for coal mining and oil drilling. It takes a lot to sort thru.
1263 2018-03-01 21:25:52 Katie, what did you do today? I made a salad using spinach, mushrooms, bell pepper, and an onion. Since the original salad dressing expired, I made dressing from apple cider vinegar, olive oil, lemon, garlic powder, and salt. It was okay.
1264 2018-03-01 21:25:27 Try Kratom & CBD oil it has helped millions. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to banned these God given plants for health issues. God bless

1276 2018-03-01 21:23:59 Tree oil is life 
1277 2018-03-01 21:23:52 Apparently, the palm oil came from an old shipwreck and was washed up onto Sefton’s beaches. The substance is safe for humans but toxic to dogs.
1278 2018-03-01 21:23:34 Sorry to hear that you're living with chronic pain. Good that you aren't having to use opiods. I'm having to use them. Have tried marijuana--actually cbd oil--but it hasn't worked for me. My father was on morphine for 30 years.

1280 2018-03-01 21:23:25 I'm not pro-tory, I'm a proper Conservative, socialism isn't the answer I can tell you that much. If the people of this country buy Corbyn's snake oil they'll get what they deserve, but I can't see that happening anyway.
1281 2018-03-01 21:23:03 Does it come standard with the oil pan you'll need to put under it when it starts leaking oil after 12,000 miles?
1282 2018-03-01 21:22:53 You have no idea what the term "snake oil" means you're too young. Being coached is pathetic.........
1283 2018-03-01 21:22:39 Kill dollar, Save oil, thus stocks.  Gold reaps benefit.  I think our real retest of lows is next week.
And I hope (268 calls 3/16)

The volume on that day is insane
1284 2018-03-01 21:22:22 Not a plug , This is real Love . I hope he is using some #cannabismeds so he don't pop himself . CBD hemp oil is proven to help blood vessels . I'm glad the NFL is openly talking about Cannabis and how this nonsense plant war effects the players (plus all them #TBI need weed) .
1285 2018-03-01 21:22:14 Taxing all of US businesses/consumers is anti-US principles. Currently the US is number 4 in the world in producing steel. We are in no way even close to loosing the ability to make steel for military concerns if that is your worry. Look at oil production, markets work have faith

1291 2018-03-01 21:21:44 I use primrose oil and taking long bubble baths to help manage my anxiety but it has to go hand in hand with seeking the right help in therapy etc! #TalkMH
1292 2018-03-01 21:21:38 All those figures may be bad for oil majors, but would of course condemn billions to death.
1293 2018-03-01 21:21:35 Oil isn't going anywhere.
DOD considers climate change prep a priority operational issue.  Extreme on either end, nor doing nothing just isn't the answer.

1299 2018-03-01 21:20:33 Whereas having multiple seizures a day is just fine for a child. Alfie Dingley would be DEPENDENT not ADDICTED on the cannabis oil to enable a reasonable quality of life. Just like many people are DEPENDENT on their pills from the doctor every day.

It is frankly very offensive.

1315 2018-03-01 21:18:07 Anyone who spends his entire life in military service, then retires to become an international oil trader is either a GENIUS or a show player for someone else. #Maldives #Oil #Gas #News #Kunooz #MDP #Oiltrade
1316 2018-03-01 21:18:00 Will cars/gold/oil/engines/phones/medicines become cheaper to import? And how far does cheap cheese etc. go toward balancing the difference?
1317 2018-03-01 21:17:14 A proposed expansion of an Exxon Mobil Corp oil refinery could be  impacted by the Trump administration's plan to place a 25 percent tariff  on imported steel, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
1318 2018-03-01 21:17:02 He can’t even say he hasn’t had the money anymore. He’s spent and spent badly. He can’t blame the oil money we have our own billionaires. He won’t look at himself he doesn’t have that part of the brain. So it must be the fans this week.
1319 2018-03-01 21:17:00 @Hyundai - not a happy camper. You made me happy when you replaced engine at 165k Not happy it stranded me today at 178k Miles. Oil all under car. 100 mile tow!

1329 2018-03-01 21:16:17 No.  We can’t just flip to unproven, overly expensive “solutions” to replace the lifeblood of the American economy, which is oil, based on a hunch.  If you can find a way to replace it without making it too expensive for me to go to work, I’m in.

1353 2018-03-01 21:13:54 Was going to say tea tree oil, but pretty strong and not pleasant odor. I use peppermint around places ants and other bugs get in - keeps them away so might work for mosquitos. Not sire how they do in Florida, but marigolds are a natural bug repellent.
1354 2018-03-01 21:13:53 I’m honestly all for green projects because we need them but these anti oil people just have to go. We need petroleum and need rid of coal!

1361 2018-03-01 21:13:06 There's another level. *45 is doing his best to cut Iran out of the equation. Russian oil will be a "necessity", in Iran's absence. That's how they make excuses for everything. Causing problems legally, that they need to fix illegally because the situation is desperate.

1363 2018-03-01 21:12:58 And look at how the results have been for Notley.

1387 2018-03-01 21:10:24 Had it since I was 11. 33 now so doubt it will go. But what is rubbing alcohol? I use tea tree and neem oil. And aloe Vera soup.
1388 2018-03-01 21:10:11 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil, yeah they're gonna dig a coal-face!
Out of you.

1390 2018-03-01 21:10:04 if we dont draft Shaquon Barkley im going to self immolate on the 50 yard line of lucas oil #colts
1391 2018-03-01 21:10:03 Crush everything in the grinder or kitcheb robot, adding  salt, a little vinegar and good olive oil. If you want it thicker add some bread and crush it together. Put it into the fridge and drink it  cold or take it with spoon. Never add ice cubes. Nice and refreshing
1392 2018-03-01 21:10:01 Es difícil pero se puede. También la tenían difícil Canadá con sus oil sands, Noruega con el petróleo offshore o Australia con el coalbed methane y lo lograron. No dijeron "No somos ricos en recursos naturales". Nada se lo impide a Argentina por más dificultades que haya.
1393 2018-03-01 21:09:53 Bayelsa state an oil producing state generate as low as #1.1b  yearly wow
1394 2018-03-01 21:09:49 @realDonaldTrump policies -- huge deficits, excessive stimulus, big oil/military/infrastructure spend, reduced labor force (immigration cuts), aluminum & steel tariffs, TPP withdrawal -- are all inflationary. Will drive up real estate. Oh, wait . . #conflict? #USPolitics
1395 2018-03-01 21:09:47 I went into the mechanics expecting a 30$ oil change and walked out paying two dollars shout out to that cute oil change guy. I could get used to being single

1397 2018-03-01 21:09:36 .@SecretaryZinke joined the Trump admin one year ago today. 

In one year, Zinke has:
Gutted regulations that help reduce pollution
Eliminated protections for #publiclands and national monuments
Opened up iconic landscapes to oil and gas drilling

1398 2018-03-01 21:09:26 I hate when people ask me for my skin care routine and then get mad cause I use coconut oil . LIKE BITCH DONT ASK ME HOW I GET MY SKIN CLEARED THEN come mierda ! It works for me so kiss my ass . Lmfaoo .
1399 2018-03-01 21:09:26 Damn oil company pumped red dye in my clear tank and now guess who has to pump 500 gallons back by hand 
1400 2018-03-01 21:09:24 TY @SenatorHaywood for looking out for the health and safety of Pennsylvanians and questioning pollution from the oil and gas industry. PA must do better! #PABudget #CutMethane
1401 2018-03-01 21:09:18 Meanwhile I dressed two white baps with chopped mini gherkins and a thick slice of beef tomato. Ketchup for Liv, mustard and mayo for me. Put it all together, add a BIG portion of oven-cooked sweet potato fries (seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika and oil), and Bob's your uncle.
1402 2018-03-01 21:09:01 A signal of looming mahala in 2018 - we better sit up 

if Nigeria misses the $60 oil price blessing, we are done for in 2019/2020, transition yrs when US oil production ll likely surpass largest producer AND economies ll likely struggle AND global synchronised growth gone
1403 2018-03-01 21:09:01 Maybe this tee tree oil will get rid of these pimples
1404 2018-03-01 21:08:57 A person found intoxicated must be given a large dose of castor oil by a local doctor and failure to gulp it down will result in a fine (TX)
1405 2018-03-01 21:08:57 does anyone have experience with CBD oil? is it helpful at all?
1406 2018-03-01 21:08:57 We have a couple of oil filled radiators here if you want them?
1407 2018-03-01 21:08:52 Oil money, buying the league etc. etc. That’s been a thing for winning sides for many years, Utd especially.
1408 2018-03-01 21:08:45 Oil Money? What fucking age are you? 13?
1409 2018-03-01 21:08:37 Shia militia are in Kirkuk for stealing oil not to establish security,
1410 2018-03-01 21:08:29 Theres so much truimp is neglecting. The parks everyone resiging dapl oil leaks list goes on n on and now talk of war in 60 days from high up white house staff whats really going on with america its having a nervous brake down
1411 2018-03-01 21:08:28 why is my nose literally an oil slick o don't deserve this disrespect
1412 2018-03-01 21:08:00 I had a restaurant lunch (ox cheek) and I'm now holed up in BrewDog as most places are closed due to snowflakes.
1413 2018-03-01 21:07:53 <living bottle of olive oil
1414 2018-03-01 21:07:42 Yes a lot to agree with there. Also if hidden subsidies for fossil fuel exploration were removed / incentives put in place for decommissioning oil / gas fields (apart from as storage) then it would be a start.
1415 2018-03-01 21:07:24 How many oil branded stations do you see E85 and E15 at?  Not many!  The RFS is crucial to market access for biofuels.  #RFSWorks
1416 2018-03-01 21:07:16 this is also something that deters me... it’s hard to look for your own resources bc there’s so many snake oil folks lmao ;; i’m getting better at separating fact from fiction but man. people really profit from the misinfo
1417 2018-03-01 21:07:15 Lol, you do realise Wengers team was built on Fiszman money. Or we could go back to the 30s , you know when Arsenal became a Huddersfield franchise. Oil money, I presume Arsenals sponsors?
1418 2018-03-01 21:07:01 Slice the leak. Pan fry with some oil & garlic add cream and simmer. Easy.
1419 2018-03-01 21:06:48 Funny that oil money didn't stop man utd under fergie....
1420 2018-03-01 21:06:37 i'v never even heard of cannabis oil #talkmh
1421 2018-03-01 21:06:36 I ACTUALLY DO!! i take like vitamin b/mens one a day/fish oil. i think its a sleep issue...
1422 2018-03-01 21:06:30 Superintendent Woodward, You are violating the WV Constitution, which is embarrassing from a Role Model perspective. Withe oil and gas growth, how many people do you think will chose WV over OH?  Please get these kids back in school.
1423 2018-03-01 21:06:25 And these are the people who are making great strides to improve Canada..so far succeeding at cancelling over 155 billion in oil contracts..accusing Canadians of hatred towards Muslims...calling us Nazis..far right..racist...falsely accusing India.. the HijabHoax..Well Done!
1424 2018-03-01 21:06:23 Very poor evaluation of what’s at fault here... can’t blame everything on oil money... can’t blame much on it really...
1425 2018-03-01 21:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1426 2018-03-01 21:05:57 before I looked it up, I would have assumed it meant selling New Agey snake oil (woo-woo).
1427 2018-03-01 21:05:55 Yes - and the Mafia makes all their money selling olive oil
1428 2018-03-01 21:05:50 No I just went on a palm oil rampage for no reason...it's a rainy day, I started to procrastinate and this is the result
1429 2018-03-01 21:05:32 I have coconut oil in my hair right now and said to Riley I felt like a greasy teenage boy and he told me I look like Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You
1430 2018-03-01 21:05:30 I'd like to consider myself an oil sham
1431 2018-03-01 21:05:27 The outlook shows a potential reduction in oil demand by 2040. If the pessimistic scenario happened on 2040 (which I doubt), this gives the oil industry 22 years to achieve such crude-chemical strategy.
1432 2018-03-01 21:05:20 They already have MAO (Mkhitaryan,  Aubameyang and Oil) on the pitch nah the L (Lacazette) remain make e enta to complete LMAO
1433 2018-03-01 21:05:17 Peppers , chilli , onions , cucumber , tomato, cheddar cheese, olive oil . 
1434 2018-03-01 21:05:17 Billions of pounds have transformed this team to potential future oil pipe

At least Crude Oil is up!!  Oh shit?!
1436 2018-03-01 21:04:59 Anyone have recommendations for skin care for oily skin? Your girl can’t be walking around shinin’ and blinding people with this oil 24/7

1438 2018-03-01 21:04:48 Do Americans realize Canada  is America biggest supplier of oil and trump wants to put a tax on Canada we know your president is not the smartest one you’ve ever had but someone has to start giving him better advice or we will have a tax war we all pay more 
1439 2018-03-01 21:04:36 Oil Ocean is in the Shadow expansion already unlocked.
1440 2018-03-01 21:04:29 BP Oil and Shell both are already looking ahead as they agree in 2030 there is supposed to be an estimated 300 million electric cars on the road world wide.  They are developing a new plan for a world where oil is not top priority.  What is wyo going to do then?
1441 2018-03-01 21:04:27 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
1442 2018-03-01 21:04:26 mek sure you baby oil up be4 the paint, helps with removal
1443 2018-03-01 21:04:23 How does @exxonmobil benefit from an oil embargo on Venezuela?
1444 2018-03-01 21:04:00 Highly doubt *Trump* knows whales were hunted for their oil.
1445 2018-03-01 21:03:59 *-And of course, once he's free, he takes off with his wings at quite the pace, flinging himself out the doorway the robot had come in.* 

Why don't I just take you on a guided tour of what I'm going to do with your EXPENSIVE Oil Refinery here!
1446 2018-03-01 21:03:58 Liquid dinner for me... 
1447 2018-03-01 21:03:50 I tried this foundation and it for sure has less coverage and left my face looking like an oil slick about mid day.  Not my favorite.
1448 2018-03-01 21:03:47 Update I cleaned the makeup with the oil I was allergic too because I didn't see baby oil and now my face is burning
1449 2018-03-01 21:03:32 Oil production highest in history,  unemployment claims lowest in 50 years,  incomes rising. You just like to focus on negative because you are still a never trumper.
1450 2018-03-01 21:03:11 Bruh they’ll find any damn thing wrong with your car when you go get a oil change 
1451 2018-03-01 21:03:05 if you hear this names on the first day of the month.. Go and quarantine your ears and destiny with anointing oil and holy water!(Arsenal) (Arsene Wenger) #afcvcity

1455 2018-03-01 21:02:38 Lol, I ran oil companies, used to write articles explaining science to laypeople & have studied several areas of science for over 30yrs. I understand a fair amount - enough to follow the math & verify the data & conclusions, then communicate it in simple terms to other.
1456 2018-03-01 21:02:37 @McDonalds @McDonaldsCanada

.... in my day you deep fried the French fries in delicious yummy beef tallow,and,as we all knew, you had the best French fries, anywhere. 

Then you changed. 

Its been 25years of your use of horribly unhealthy vegetable oil.

1457 2018-03-01 21:02:32 how much castor oil am i suppose to take?
1458 2018-03-01 21:02:29 I used tea tree oil on my face and now I smell like I rolled around in a field of grass
1459 2018-03-01 21:02:28 Now you are being silly. The Oilsands are the world’s greatest environmental clean up project. Oil had been leaking into Athabasca river for 1000’s of years. We are cleaning that up.
1460 2018-03-01 21:02:27 i rlly hope coconut oil wave dying down bc it truly belongs in the trash
1461 2018-03-01 21:02:21 God bless the Arab oil money 
1462 2018-03-01 21:02:18 Why does Pep need to make any additions to this outfit. But with the oil zillionaires behind him, he'll spend another 1/2 billion this summer.Great team but shows how unfairly money influences this game.
1463 2018-03-01 21:02:03 Choose @GananoqueChev for your next oil change  Our team is quick and efficient and we're not satisfied unless you are! #ThursdayThoughts
1464 2018-03-01 21:02:00 I find castor oil helps and I’m now trying almond and Amla oil which is Indian gooseberry.. 
1465 2018-03-01 21:01:35 which is not the fault of government but the private companies instead.

Also Venezuela relied too much on oil so it heavily suffered from the US-rigged oil price plunge that was made to wreck Russia's economy in the light of the events in Ukraine.
1466 2018-03-01 21:01:33 oil change, transmission fluid change, taking my mom out to eat, & shopping ... lord knows i need more coffee
1467 2018-03-01 21:01:20 I have psoriasis. I use coconut oil massaged into my scalp and leave it sometimes over night or an hour or so before washing my hair. I've found (along with coconut oil based shampoo's and conditioners) it's the only thing that's really helped mine.
1468 2018-03-01 21:01:18 The oil industry has to undertake such expensive and aggressive strategy to ensure survival under the extreme pessimistic scenario.
1469 2018-03-01 21:01:08 How often should you really check your oil?  We recommend every 2 weeks or 500 miles, check your coolant & power steering fluid, while you're inder the hood.
1470 2018-03-01 21:01:07 Hey @rihanna ! I love your @fentybeauty products, but I tried to roll a joint with your pink oil blotting papers and it was awful! I was so sad (the only reason I bought them was for that purpose). The paper burns right through.
1471 2018-03-01 21:00:56 Stickers! I put Cal Academy member stickers on my phone when I go to visit. A bunch fell off when I spilled a little coconut oil on my case, but two are still there (almost).
1472 2018-03-01 21:00:52 Oil money and Pep needed at my club @inter
1473 2018-03-01 21:00:52 I'm concerned it and/or cbd oil will show up in my urine tests at pm doc.  And then I'd risk being shut off altogether.  What's a pain-wracked body to do???  It just sucks.
1474 2018-03-01 21:00:51 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1475 2018-03-01 21:00:46 To chisel just that bit more out of the blood sweat and tears of lowly hard working NZers by withdrawing or underfunding the back stops like health and education, clean water/environment, housing, decent work conditions, in favour of roads, oil barons and expensive consultants

No clunkers (cars) in site jst trucks & nice cars. We need all businesses to operate in our communities, not only for Nat. Security but prsprty
1479 2018-03-01 21:00:24 .@PennsylvaniaDEP @SecMcDonnell says PA has "very good oil and gas regulations" yet there's nothing on the books to control climate-warming methane pollution. We have a long way to go, Secretary. #PABudget #CutMethane
1480 2018-03-01 21:00:18 I think i will try argan  or jojoba oil
1481 2018-03-01 21:00:15 I am sorry Mr. P.A to the Kaduna State governor. Maybe you should also inform him that he should only tweet exclusively on what is going on in Kaduna. To me personally, when a tweet carries "Nigeria", "Oil", and "Human Capital" I don't think it's on state level anymore. Thanks 
1482 2018-03-01 21:00:12 Change the oil in your car every five thousand kilometers. #CarCare
1483 2018-03-01 21:00:00 Lol fam I cook, clean, change oil, braid hair man it’s nothing I can do. It’s the useless men that’s offended
1484 2018-03-01 20:59:57 Apply a lot of oil to your hair and the complete body before Holi, don’t wear lenses, use ear birds if playing with water and cut your nails
1485 2018-03-01 20:59:55 Studies also said that we would run out of oil in the 60’s.
1486 2018-03-01 20:59:55 highest record of oil production in the USA since 47 years ago......
Thank You POTUS!
1487 2018-03-01 20:59:44 bitch why the fuck would i buy a $20 coconut oil? @ safari
1488 2018-03-01 20:59:40 Coconut oil overnight and lush shampoo “ float and soak” plus only use natural condiiitner and no products at all.x
1489 2018-03-01 20:59:20 Note to self: don’t go to the nearest oil change place 
1490 2018-03-01 20:59:20 Just landed! We are staying across the street from Lucas oil. We got to meet up this weekend
1491 2018-03-01 20:59:18 Horseshit. The Wheat Board put(Western) farmers, in prison for selling their product in markets that paid them more. An oil pipeline frees the rails for grain. A little less foreign funding of obstructionist ENGOs would be nice.
1492 2018-03-01 20:59:13 Silly, you sell our Gay friendly Oil. The purchaser buys Canada’s gay friendly instead of enriching dictators.

1495 2018-03-01 20:58:47 Markets in Tariff oil on @CNBC tonight
1496 2018-03-01 20:58:42 I’m in a mellow hippie coffeehouse that’s playing the soothing sounds of the Grateful Dead meanwhile in the back room the owners are arguing, yelling, screaming & cursing at each other. Commerce and patchouli oil always make strange bedfellows.
1497 2018-03-01 20:58:37 Excellent. Luckily I have a gas fire in front room and an oil heater I could use in the bedroom.
1498 2018-03-01 20:58:33 Is it possible to overdose on olbas oil?! Asking for s mate
1499 2018-03-01 20:58:15 You are a fool. US is stealing oil as we speak
1500 2018-03-01 20:58:06 Tried to take a tea trea oil bath. I’m about to pass out. I literally put 3 drops in here, this shit soooo strong  
1501 2018-03-01 20:58:04 I'm not sure? Some good hydration cream and essence oil.
1502 2018-03-01 20:57:51 What is particularly sad is that no one questions these snake oil salesman.Seriously Greenland??? Do you think those naming Greenland were just being Sarcastic? Do some research & use some critical thinking...that's Science
1503 2018-03-01 20:57:38 Spending my birthday at work and then getting an oil change #nobodylikesyouwhenyoure24either
1504 2018-03-01 20:57:36 If we can combine that with a record low of oil demand in the US, then I'm cheering.
1505 2018-03-01 20:57:31 Holyshit what a fukton of oil
1506 2018-03-01 20:57:31 Dear, thanks for your comment. I am not talking about plastic in specific. I am talking about a comprehensive long term R&D strategy to innovate and create new non-combusted materials out oil.
1507 2018-03-01 20:57:29 Anybody know who do cheap oil changes ?
1508 2018-03-01 20:57:28 Tom the Plumber is coming tomorrow! Neighbours have lent us oil heaters
1509 2018-03-01 20:57:26 Sure is. Had a guy tell me "you're the first drone operator to come through town who hasn't been a snake oil salesman." Just be honest with your customer.
1510 2018-03-01 20:57:26    i don't wanna overdose castor oil mos.
1511 2018-03-01 20:57:23 @JohnFeehery @juliemason one way to fight opoid addiction is to legalize hemp. Hemp-based CBD oil is keeping me off opoid pain meds.
1512 2018-03-01 20:57:19 weed oil n matcha! green batter to your brain>:)
1513 2018-03-01 20:57:19 I support our @POTUS but disagree that arms should be confiscated from citizens without due process, that we should drill for oil in our wildlife sanctuaries or prop up our economy with arms deals.
1514 2018-03-01 20:56:58 As an oil producer I can’t wait until we slap a big tariff on foreign crude next time the price goes in the tank.  And then foreufn firms retaliate by slapping tarrifs on our exports to them.  There is no bottom to this pit, as we found out in Great Depression.
1515 2018-03-01 20:56:56 Why you talking? Oil money.
1516 2018-03-01 20:56:52 Friendship ended with canola oil; now olive oil is my best friend
1517 2018-03-01 20:56:44 You received my order 2 weeks ago and you still haven't delivered my oil!
1518 2018-03-01 20:56:36 And work shop tools, and change her own oil and tires. Oh this poor kid has it out for herself 
1519 2018-03-01 20:56:27 Hope your agoyin is the original one... some of yall be cooking beans and oil... and be calling it agoyin.
1520 2018-03-01 20:55:51 Oil taps were not turned off on 15 December 2013. Ask your Govt and the new management you have had since why is there no difference after Kiir dismissed those supposedly bad guys whom he had once branded as thieves? Rather, it's all abt mortgaging our future. What a hypocrisy?
1521 2018-03-01 20:55:50 Any oil heaters goin???

1526 2018-03-01 20:55:18 Ok, you that can see & understand, tell me just two non oil sector that we have boon.

1530 2018-03-01 20:54:02 Best 4b/c hair detangler I’ve yet to come across: ACV & water + flaxseed oil. My hair so soft and tangle free 
1531 2018-03-01 20:53:57 I love ppl like u. Oil isn’t just for cars! It’s in vaccines, clothing, every building. You can’t even build a single renwb eng project w/o!
1532 2018-03-01 20:53:49 cannabis oil does the same thing. And garlic, I think. Anyway, we don't need doctors while we have facebook.
1533 2018-03-01 20:53:47 WTI Crude Oil -1.0% to 61.00 bbl $USO
Gold -1.0% to 1305.10 oz $GLD
Copper -0.3% to 3.12 lb $CU
1534 2018-03-01 20:53:29 Been some rough days over the past months but today I am smiling. I'm in steel, copper, aluminum, oil 500 drop on DOW 40 on $ES and I'm green.
1535 2018-03-01 20:53:26 Chiarelli really turned this thing in Oil Country to crap. He's got 8 million coming off the books with at least 5 RFAs to get done, Nurse will demand at least half of it. Then there's the scoring winger for Connor. My guess RNH and Klefbom plus the 1ST rounder get dealt.
1536 2018-03-01 20:53:22 Oil signed a new contract FC
1537 2018-03-01 20:53:07 offline tip 300tokens and it'll be sent to your inbox 14min hd glitter oil and kitty tail play 
1538 2018-03-01 20:53:05 Aye, good luck with £land, mate but let's get real, Scotland will be out of your beloved British union too, so kiss goodbye to our natural resources, unless you start paying tarrifs to eat Scotland's fish & meat & fill up your tank with Scottish oil
1539 2018-03-01 20:52:39 perks of working in a city by an oil refinery on a rainy day lol amiright
1540 2018-03-01 20:52:26 Creo que me está empezando a gustar esto de cocinar. Para el almuerzo me hice una pasta con salsa marinara (que también preparé) y papas horneadas con especies, olive oil, quesito. Simple pero riquis, como yo. 
1541 2018-03-01 20:52:24 and bio oil for my acne scars
1542 2018-03-01 20:52:21 No wonder Oil stayed at Arsenal, there isn't another team in the world that would have paid him 350.000 a month, never mind a week.
1543 2018-03-01 20:52:20 Coco oil tends to cook me I have tried aloe tho it seems so hard to handle lol
1544 2018-03-01 20:52:18 I have tried using CBD oil for pain and it has personally worked for me. I also have been working recently on my breathing and vision. So far so good. Glad I stopped my stubborn thinking.
1545 2018-03-01 20:52:18 The same way Diezani was a mirage that made ur boss GEJ squander our oil money on her at the expense of the "vibrant" economy
1546 2018-03-01 20:52:04 I used to be the Cable Guy.
Nine times out of 10 the prob. it's on the ISP side. Call them every time there's a problem.... everyday.
 It's one of those situations where the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1547 2018-03-01 20:51:25 Message to corporate at Five Minute Oil Change: Raising Cane's survived after Les Miles was canned, so YOU CAN DO IT without Kenny Vaccaro!
1548 2018-03-01 20:51:23 I need to find myself a Mrs Oil! Sometimes you just cannot be bothered cooking when it's for one...

1550 2018-03-01 20:51:01 If Wenger had an ounce of love for Arsene FC sorry Arsenal he would just fucking fuck off now! 3 fucking 0 again to those oil slags for the 2nd time in 4 days ands its only half fucking time! Single handedly destroyed his own legacy!
1551 2018-03-01 20:50:32 Oil drum as a fez etc.
1552 2018-03-01 20:50:01 You used baby oil?
1553 2018-03-01 20:49:51 Gen go fuck up. Engine oil dried up 'n e con stiff. Not pulling. Dem just bring lyt now
1554 2018-03-01 20:49:46 I used oil and Shea butter and they were STUCK.
1555 2018-03-01 20:49:31 Supplements aren’t elixirs. However, when used to complement a healthy lifestyle and strict training supplements are well worth the price of admission.
1) MULTIVITAMINS
2) FISH OIL Fish oil has been shown to boost immune system and brain function prevent muscle breakdow fat loss
1556 2018-03-01 20:49:29 I’ve founded two oil companies - and would do so again if the profits were there, yet I accept the scientific weight of evidence on climate change. Your position is far more rigid imho :)
1557 2018-03-01 20:49:23 Wash (Bug & Tar, Oil & Grease, Engine), Paint Prep & Clay, Correction Cream, Perfection Cream, Show Wax, Finishing Sealant, Bug Barricade, Window Sealant, Trim Restoration, Heavy-Duty Wheel Cleaner, Black Tire Shine.
1558 2018-03-01 20:49:22 He needs to be processed for this as a completely separate matter...And the law needs to updated so people like me with MS can buy our oils from producers with lab reports and proper safety procedures. His previous fraud would bother me more than the current cannabis oil set up!
1559 2018-03-01 20:49:20 Well it's good to know you're delivering oil ! @Boilerjuice told me there was no oil and none of your tankers were on the road!
1560 2018-03-01 20:49:15 ponle oil limit
1561 2018-03-01 20:49:11 Satan is awesome! He knows how to party!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1562 2018-03-01 20:49:09 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
1563 2018-03-01 20:48:57 New symphonic traps help, rather than dripping. Oil lines is usually condensation that freeze in filters.
1564 2018-03-01 20:48:51 Watching this tonight and seeing united not challenging for the title this year makes me miss the good old days of united v arsenal rivalry when it was proper football before city were formed in 2008 and oil money took over
1565 2018-03-01 20:48:37 #Do you have oil heating?
1566 2018-03-01 20:48:11 It will never stop amazing me that 42% of my fellow Americans like this snake oil salesman! I guess conmen wouldn’t be in business if there weren’t gullible people?
1567 2018-03-01 20:48:04 I bet they would be acting quickly if the Oil and gas wanted a vote.  Spiteful and arrogant.
1568 2018-03-01 20:48:02 That does it.
I will NEVER take my truck to Bed Bath Beyond for another oil change or for new tires, EVER AGAIN.
1569 2018-03-01 20:47:55 Warm olive oil?
1570 2018-03-01 20:47:44 I wonder if he will answer how he feels about all these pipelines being forcefully laid under american soil to move frakked shale oil from Canada
1571 2018-03-01 20:47:44 How can oil really last a year?
1572 2018-03-01 20:47:37 One of the reasons cilantro herb oil blends well with citrus oils is because of what they have in common. What is it? Aliphatic aldehydes. These compounds are found in common citrus oils & in cilantro & coriander. Essential Oil Quality Alliance - Cilantro Oil
1573 2018-03-01 20:47:35 What brilliant timing to run out of oil! That’s no heating and hot water then during the coldest spell! Fabulous!
1574 2018-03-01 20:47:35 I'm thinking it could be both. Real Assets encompass "precious metals, commodities, real estate, agricultural land, machinery and oil." Either way, they lost dough!
1575 2018-03-01 20:47:33 おはよー。
1576 2018-03-01 20:47:25 Grape seed oil and pure vitamin E oil for face is great, hazelnut is good for body

Gov Mutua: No cutting down trees in Machakos County. Let's plant more trees.

Gov. Ngilu: Burn any lorry or vehicle carrying charcoal in any part of Kitui County. I will be there to release you from police station if arrested.
1579 2018-03-01 20:46:43 Avocado oil got my beard smelling good as a mf
1580 2018-03-01 20:46:34 For greens, I'd eat cucumber, broccoli, and avocado.  From the avocado and coconut oil, you'll get energy from the fat, and from the cucumber and broccoli you'll get the minimal amount of carbs that you need.  The protein obviously comes from meat.  Don't eat sauces with sugars.
1581 2018-03-01 20:46:33 Rich football is all that matter now! The oil billionaires, sky and the media have fucked it #Sadtimes
1582 2018-03-01 20:46:31 Major. He who sold us the snake oil that got us into this fine mess.
1583 2018-03-01 20:46:26 The sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s were described as genocidal by 2 UN oil for food programme directors who both resigned over the issue. Did anyone call for Intervention? The US killed 10,000 bombing Mosul last year. Why no cries of Genocide & calls for Intervention?
1584 2018-03-01 20:46:24 At the this rate arsenal are going to discover oil
1585 2018-03-01 20:46:08 Yea, but oil looking at it from a stand point like @DANNYonPC and @FlakfireGaming 

From that it seems like, Danny got lucky and flak is flak 

And then there's you. You better fucking take off on Youtube. I love the randomness vids btw
1586 2018-03-01 20:45:55 Scandinavian countries have vast oil wealth that they use wisely to achieve good services all year round. Where has our oil wealth gone? Can’t blame her for doing her best with what we’ve not got!
1587 2018-03-01 20:45:52 @MDNRPolice say they were called around 10:45 am to the north end of Assateague Island for a missing plane out of Ocean City Municipal Airport. An oil slick has been found in the water. @MDSP are investigating.
1588 2018-03-01 20:45:45 Here the oil will turn cold - 26 this morning 
1589 2018-03-01 20:45:45 More of the same from Putin’s Russia. Further isolate yourself among the world economy with your aggressive initiative. At some point in the near future, most of the modern world will finally get off oil, and your ass economy will crater. Then a 2nd Glasnost will occur sans Putin
1590 2018-03-01 20:45:40 PSA: Don’t watch @QueerEye while you’re getting your oil changed; you’ll end up bawling in the middle of the car dealership

1595 2018-03-01 20:45:29 Until FIFA and the FA enforce financial fair play or the oil runs out it Abu Dhabi the competitiveness in the premier league is finished and we will end up with lots of stadiums with empty seats as there will he only one team that can win the league
1596 2018-03-01 20:45:23 Go buy pure oil at natural pantry, I use hazelnut (cold pressed ) and put it all over your body right after you shower. I moisturize morning and nigh 
1597 2018-03-01 20:45:16 sooo uhh I bought a bottle of evening primrose oil capsules, & it smells EXACTLY like the coroner’s office inside the bottle..
I gagged.
1598 2018-03-01 20:45:15 Till they find oil
1599 2018-03-01 20:45:13 The @TheIPA has weighed in on #TriStar’s push to mine the #ArckaringaBasin. Research Fellow Daniel Wild says the #CooberPedy Council’s concerns over water damage in the #GreatArtesianBasin are not enough to stop fracture stimulation for oil and gas. @ABCnorthandwest @abcnews
1600 2018-03-01 20:45:10 I've switched to a good straight razor and after a year of damn near accidentally killing myself I've gotten the hang of it and my skin doesnt hate me for it, esp. if I oil up right after, as well as exfoliate in the shower and hot water or steam it.
1601 2018-03-01 20:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1602 2018-03-01 20:45:07 "Some people come to the Middle East looking for oil; i came to find brains and i found it in Israel" after  he made his $Billion investment in Iscar.

1605 2018-03-01 20:45:00 Our afternoon member spotlight is Nancy Melchor, she offers #BobRoss oil #painting classes at @HinesvilleArts the 4th weekend of e/month!
1606 2018-03-01 20:44:57 That ones better than the vape oil ?
1607 2018-03-01 20:44:42 So you deny Watergate? The Iran contra? The USA UK sponsored revolution? The 10 year Iran Iraq proxy war? When Saddam was your friend before you kangaroo court assassinated him and stole Iraqi oil and gold and money? Go research for yourself. Lazy bones.
1608 2018-03-01 20:44:39 I really want to give this aneeka babe a facial , or tea tree oil 
1609 2018-03-01 20:44:31 Find a good face oil that makes u all glowy! Chapstick and lipgloss! 
1610 2018-03-01 20:44:30 So Tillerson resigns then?
Only reason he was SecState.

1612 2018-03-01 20:43:52 And the unlimited amount of oil money.
1613 2018-03-01 20:43:51 Anyone know any places on the island that do oil changes for BMWS, called 7 places and they don’t have the gauge key....smfh
1614 2018-03-01 20:43:48 Cheap metals being flooded in to our market is what put numerous businesses under.
Same thing happened with oil when OPEC decided to undervalue oil in a mostly successful attempt to put American interests out of business.
At some point we need to say to foreign interests.
1615 2018-03-01 20:43:45 Haha I know right, Russia is a joke  
How does a country with that much gas, oil and coal stay broke. 
I reckon Putin will end up hanging from a lamppost. Hahaha can’t wait for the ppl to get some balls.
1616 2018-03-01 20:43:44 #1 I’m from BC so it’s only part “my oil” #2 you accept import but not exports #3 there is already a pipeline! #4oil already travels past us
1617 2018-03-01 20:43:37 Say what you want about the oil money, emptihad etc etc......

Anyone looking at those goals and not applauding needs to stop taking the Bitter pills. Utterly stunning football so ride the wave #citeh
1618 2018-03-01 20:43:34 my uncle came up with a slogan for O&G: “Oil is the Blood of Satan”
smart guy, that one :)
1619 2018-03-01 20:43:30 You need to use a coaster from now on. Heat damaged the surface of the table, may be able to remove it with some oil treatment to the surface, though.
1620 2018-03-01 20:43:16 Then I'd dump some US bonds for sale in Iran - Imagine that! America in debt to the Ayatollah 
Exchange bonds for oil...
1621 2018-03-01 20:43:15 Where do Arsenal go from here? Further down! Well, the positive - At this rate, we'll soon discover crude oil
1622 2018-03-01 20:43:14 Think there’s nothing

BLEND until fine

1 T Honey or agave nectar

1623 2018-03-01 20:43:14 The oil industry is going to react to implement Crude-Chemicals to make new non-combusted uses of oil, just in case if oil lost some shares in the transportation sector.
1624 2018-03-01 20:43:08 Indeed, the match is almost a reverse of what City-Arsenal matches used to be like before City struck oil

1627 2018-03-01 20:42:48 Been tweeting a lot about gold today, but generally most commodities to benefit here. Oil is always sensitive to geopolitics, this could definitely shake up the market with the uncertainty Trump continues to create. My commodities of choice Gold, Silver, Copper, Zinc, and Oil.
1628 2018-03-01 20:42:40 Reggie went to get an oil change and jiffy lube said he has the most mileage they have ever seen #roadto400k

1630 2018-03-01 20:42:27 And Russian steel is being used in the oil pipelines. China dumps cheap steel on the market--so does Russia.
1631 2018-03-01 20:42:23 Banana oil?
1632 2018-03-01 20:42:21 @5_News @FPS_oil members have been working hard across the country in difficult conditions to get heating oil out to rural communities One company today delivered heating oil by carrying containers 3/4m to a lady’s house who had a young baby #BigFreezeOn5

1634 2018-03-01 20:42:04 Our Secretary of State is a former big oil CEO. I have a good idea of how *45 will react.
1635 2018-03-01 20:42:01 How does anybody compete against a cheque book team ? The Arsenal invincible team would have given them a game and they weren’t bought with oil money 
1636 2018-03-01 20:41:59 Don't bother. I managed to get through to customer services and they were no help at all . I ordered my oil two weeks ago ! Apparently there are no tankers delivering oil and there is no oil in some depots, and they can't say when deliveries will be made 
1637 2018-03-01 20:41:47 I’m so sorry for hearing about Jim Kelly cancer returning If I could speak to him I would tell him he may wanna look at Medical Marijuana/CBD oil as an alternative or an aid in his fight
1638 2018-03-01 20:41:40 essential oil diffusers would be way cooler if they offered chocolate chip cookies or cinnamon rolls as scent options
1639 2018-03-01 20:41:32 Please @officialncdmb when exactly will this park be completed and what exactly will be contained in this Oil and Gas Park?
1640 2018-03-01 20:41:31 Saquon is the biggest RB at the combine by a good stretch and after what I saw last year he may very well be the fastest by a mile...he runs sub 4.40 Lucas Oil Stadium is gonna implode!
1641 2018-03-01 20:41:31 How about tariffs on foreign oil ????
1642 2018-03-01 20:41:30 went to @Applebees craving a burger last night.   Ordered the Whiskey Bacon Burger, with the sauce on the side.  But it was so awful.  I couldn't taste the cheese, the bacon, or the onion straws.  All I tasted was grease.  Such a disappointment. Just ground beef w/oil.
1643 2018-03-01 20:41:24 Lmfao..... Thaaank you some of yall chop suey be having too much oil Lmfao.
1644 2018-03-01 20:41:23 The board , the manager , the entire back line , the entire mid field bar oil and Wilshere and the fact that Danny Welbeck is on the bloody pitch, put on Nketiah instead he's better than Welbeck all ready!
1645 2018-03-01 20:41:21 Oil comes in tomorrow 
1646 2018-03-01 20:41:19 Mix that with Cantu curling cream and you should be good. Add a couple drops of vitamin E oil to the Cantu.
1647 2018-03-01 20:41:18 Things what I learnt today. More than 3 days of cold and it doesn't matter how well lagged a external boiler condensate pipe is  - it will freeze up.
Higher levels of moisture in heating oil 'bio-diesel' means that after 3 days of cold oil lines freeze up. Great thing progress.
1648 2018-03-01 20:41:18 I hope the new job doesn’t interfere with Twitter! You’re a blast!
1649 2018-03-01 20:41:16 That school has strong ties to OIL AND GAS industries FWIW.
1650 2018-03-01 20:41:14 Nail on head. And then hidden behind ‘but they’ve got oil money’ excuse. Money is a factor of course, but every signing has been a means towards an end. The approach of other top managers feels scattergun
1651 2018-03-01 20:41:11 1.  Looks like I hit a nerve with the oil industry with my article yesterday.  Several people sent me comments by a lobbyist arguing that some of my points were a LIE.   My responses follow.
1652 2018-03-01 20:41:09 I like potatoes smashed with parsley, salt, pepper and olive oil
1653 2018-03-01 20:41:07 100 dollars for a fucking oil change fuck is the world coming to
1654 2018-03-01 20:41:05 i'm legit so desperate to not be ill anymore that i want to buy oil of oregano and drink it all.
1655 2018-03-01 20:41:04 Look, you don't know what a civil right is. So just go oil your gun, nerd.
1656 2018-03-01 20:40:58 Hi Isabella, I wish you the best of luck on your journey.  I would recommend low carb dieting.  It has worked like a gem for me.  Meat, greens, and coconut oil.  That's all I eat.  I don't feel hungry at all.  Try it for two weeks.  You'll be motivated to continue at that point.
1657 2018-03-01 20:40:47 ANYONE GOT OIL
1658 2018-03-01 20:40:31 Oh well, believe a snake oil salesmen....

1661 2018-03-01 20:40:19 Well,  for example, how we used to get oil here in Europe. Not by trading with  the Arabs, but because we were forced by America. We used rapeseed oil  here as petrol for cars, but before World War one, America forced us to  use petroleum as petrol for cars. 1/2

1663 2018-03-01 20:40:10 Me: Store closes soon I should run and buy some pastries 

My ass: Hey do you remember how all you ate the other day was basically habanero and garlic fried in oil 

Me: no pls stop
1664 2018-03-01 20:40:05 lol it would take a little bit more than some lavender oil for me to “get got”
1665 2018-03-01 20:40:03 Lots of olive oil, tea tree oil, and raw aloe vera
1666 2018-03-01 20:40:00 Olive oil and grapeseed oil have antioxidants that will help remove lotion. It will also help prevent breakouts.
1667 2018-03-01 20:39:58 Michigan most polluted zip code is a Detroit neighborhood surrounded by oil refineries , steel plants , coal incinerators ,and salt mines that release some 1.6 million pounds of chemicals into the community each year is 85 percent African American. #FlintLivesMatter #Flintastic
1668 2018-03-01 20:39:57 BC has many former resource exploitation sites which have been abandoned by their foreign owners, leaving behind things like deteriorating structures, wood and concrete, some with oil drums half filled with who knows what.

1670 2018-03-01 20:39:51 @BreakfastNews PETROL pricing;  wonder if any way the GOVERNMENT  can get into the business??? It is Australia's OIL......Maybe threaten to build a GOVERNMENT  REFINERY ALL THE WAY TO RETAIL OUTLET  over the next ten years,,,competition..No doubt public is being ripped off  now.
1671 2018-03-01 20:39:45 CAN YOU BELIEVE john used the last of my good olive oil to put in his ear ??
1672 2018-03-01 20:39:45 Quick question to the hive mind, does any company do emergency oil deliveries in this weather? (Need to be able to deliver to Cobh)

PS asking on behalf of someone else, we have gas at home thankfully
1673 2018-03-01 20:39:37 War monger and oil baron.
1674 2018-03-01 20:39:26 We dont need their oil. You has that same lame song over Iraq & we didn't make a penny off of them.
1675 2018-03-01 20:39:22 Unsustainable palm oil plantations are one of the #1 causes for deforestation and endangered species in the world...I made a list of things to stop buying...OREOS ARE ON THE LIST. Aka time to write an angry letter to the CEO of Oreo.
1676 2018-03-01 20:39:03 *Goes in for oil change

Cashier: you want us to change your tires. Your wipers look worn down. And we can also...

Me: i just need an oil change
1677 2018-03-01 20:39:03 What I’m saying is I don’t want bitumen shipped and sent out into the waters off our shores. Do some research as to what happens. It’s a natural disaster that can’t be cleaned up. I don’t want pipelines or rail or horse drawn wagon . I don’t want your dirty oil.
1678 2018-03-01 20:38:52 They only way to stop ManCity is for every one to start buying electric cars no need for oil no money for city owners to spend on players plus you get to save the planet in the process #ARSMAN

1681 2018-03-01 20:38:50 shea butter + grape seed oil= heaven for your skin
1682 2018-03-01 20:38:37 I had no idea that my Jag doesn’t require service appointments or oil changes until every 16k miles. That’s kinda trippy. 
1683 2018-03-01 20:38:37 5165H
1684 2018-03-01 20:38:31 Sitting here waiting on my oil change and debating on a scale of 1-10 how embarrassing it would be if I took a little nap.
1685 2018-03-01 20:38:27 Today in ENGL 1191 we talked about Oil and Water, a play by Newfoundland playwright Robert Chafe about the amazing story of Lanier Phillip. If you aren't familiar, I recommend looking it up!
1686 2018-03-01 20:38:19 Demand for oil and other liquid fuels grows over much of the Outlook, but gradually slows and plateaus in the later years of the Outlook.
The increase in liquids production is initially dominated by US tight oil, but is later driven by OPEC.

The future is for OPEC
1687 2018-03-01 20:38:14 This is bullshit. Paid for by oil and gas companies poisoning our earth and our health in the name of corporate greed. Pathetic!!
1688 2018-03-01 20:38:03 oil #ALDUBBetterDays
1689 2018-03-01 20:37:59 you could look into cbd oil :)
1690 2018-03-01 20:37:40 me: oh, it’s 2AM let’s watch something lighT

me, not an intellectual: *watches Lorenzo’s Oil (1992) dir. George Miller*
1691 2018-03-01 20:37:30 Probiotic, fish oil, multivitamin, and L-the anime
1692 2018-03-01 20:37:19 I haven’t been using heat on my hair.. ive been taking multivitamins, fish oil, collagen powder & hair vitamins. I mean I’ve been doing this for a whole week, why ain’t my hair grown 
1693 2018-03-01 20:37:11 Superb football but let’s not forget the ridiculous amount of money they spend! I’m sure their oil money would be better used and spent on humanitarian projects!
1694 2018-03-01 20:37:03 Heads are rolling at Five Minute Oil Change.
1695 2018-03-01 20:37:02 Okay, but just know that when I have oil his dry, giant balls later today...it’s entirely platonic. 
1696 2018-03-01 20:36:53 @QueerEye guys I love ur show but gOD please don't put essential oils directly on ur skin!!!! dilute them properly in another kind of oil first cause they can seriously burn you!!!!
1697 2018-03-01 20:36:42 Apple cider vinegar, mouth wash, tea tree oil, coconut oil
1698 2018-03-01 20:36:41 Chicken imported, rice imported, onion imported, Tomato puree imported , oil even the bowl is imported.  tweaaa!!
1699 2018-03-01 20:36:39 History teachers gonna be coming thru with crossbows and vats of hot oil
1700 2018-03-01 20:36:33 Renewable energy is the fastest-growing energy source, accounting for 40% of the increase in primary energy. The energy mix by 2040 is the most diversified the world has ever seen.

Oil will be less in % but more in quantity compared to current level.
1701 2018-03-01 20:36:20 I bet you can’t! Bolton with oil 
1702 2018-03-01 20:36:17 Funny cause I remember when Oil fans were throwing jerseys on the ice. Every team has down years and fair weather fans.
1703 2018-03-01 20:36:06 Oil my scalp and I’ll oil your whole body up.
1704 2018-03-01 20:35:53 Yup! Pommes Frites, right on MacDougal street, approximately a 5 minute walk from my classroom Rn. Comes in paper cones of regular and large portions, with a huge array of dipping sauces. Fried in gluten free veggie oil. They also serve poutine
1705 2018-03-01 20:35:44 actually it can be caused by how you wash your face... if you don’t wash you face properly and use products that are bad for your skin it can irritate it and cause acne or produce more oil that leads to acne
1706 2018-03-01 20:35:33 early 2000’s, before the oil money is where it was at. Fuck these days
1707 2018-03-01 20:35:14 I see our fraking our own oil is helping this country out.
1708 2018-03-01 20:35:12 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1709 2018-03-01 20:34:53 IS the INTENT to create MOATS around the united states to keep out or keep us in, along with the "wall?" Talk about "CHEESY, storybook stuff!" #Republicans @POTUS Because the oil isn't STAYING in the united states; it's being exported along with the strategic reserves.
1710 2018-03-01 20:34:37 One of the great things about using beard oils in the Pacific Northwest is the water just bounces off the beard since the oil's hydrophobic!
1711 2018-03-01 20:34:30 How did we get into a conversation about marijuana and cbd oil? Oh mom, if you only knew 
1712 2018-03-01 20:34:28 Makes sense. If foreign companies manage to shut down all domestic production, we will be severely harmed if importers want to start playing games. We were in the same position in the oil market in the past.
1713 2018-03-01 20:34:20 Parce que le gas Oil  gèle . Mais il doit avoir un additif .... Sauf si un peu d'eau se trouve la !!!
1714 2018-03-01 20:34:15 Decided to reduce the sugary and oily foods from yesterday. Glad that I survived one day with the lowest amount of sugar and oil I ever used  Credits should goes to the person who made my mind 
1715 2018-03-01 20:34:15 Probably doesn't realise the premier league existed prior to the 'oil money' and Spain's euro dominance. Assume he missed the Milan, Juve and Ajax fantastic football playing teams too.
1716 2018-03-01 20:34:13 This rising prosperity drives an increase in global energy demand, although the extent of this growth is offset by accelerating gains in energy efficiency: energy demand increases by only around one third over the next 25 years Including an increase in oil & gas demand.
1717 2018-03-01 20:34:00 I can't believe I just spent twice as more money on oil than what I would have spent getting smaller quarts 
1718 2018-03-01 20:33:58 Someone recommended placing cotton balls (inconspicuously) in the area you don't want mosquitoes, and every day adding a new drop of the lemon eucalyptus essential oil on each cotton ball. But also remember to put some drops on yourself, too. Good luck!
1719 2018-03-01 20:33:54 OMG! Mr. Rapp, please block @ngblog . Trust me when I say he is TOXIC.  Just block and tap your forehead with some anointing oil. #nojoke #trustme
1720 2018-03-01 20:33:48 Mental health hack: accidentally spill a calming essential oil all over your backpack. Every time you reach for your stuff you get a whiff of relaxation. 

Bonus: watch strangers always trying to figure out what the smell is.
1721 2018-03-01 20:33:42 ya, CBD & cannabis oil for the little homie
1722 2018-03-01 20:33:42 We can't compete with this oil money. No one will till pep stays.
1723 2018-03-01 20:33:13 Please let me know one type of renewable that doesn’t need petroleum base products? I’m a huge supporter of renewables but oil is required.
1724 2018-03-01 20:32:57 Natural Beauty Tip for Sunken Eyes:- 

Apply almond oil under the eyes several times a day.

Almond oil is rich in Vitamin E, a nourishing vitamin for skin.
1725 2018-03-01 20:32:43 Patricia Falvey's upcoming novel will cover Irish immigrants who go to the US East Coast and travel on to Texas during the Oil Boom here in the early 20th century. Several of my relatives went to school in Philadelphia. Lot of history there!
1726 2018-03-01 20:32:37 Biggest Hippocrates in Canada. Have the environmental reports, studies and ERP's been properly reviewed and agreed upon by all of Canada. Ports are Federal. Its time for sanctions, wine, electricity then pinch off there oil supply. Alberta must be pro-active not re-active.
1727 2018-03-01 20:32:36 What i meant was a pause doesn't meant stopped completely. They could have not shipped oil for a day or two, or something like that. You'd have to ask CN for exact details on where they are doing this.
1728 2018-03-01 20:32:29 #ARSMCI mezut oil is lazy

1733 2018-03-01 20:31:38 Super good to know. Seems like that kind of system could make it easier to cook food in lower smoke-point oils, like olive oil, yes?

I ask as an apartment dweller with a hyper-vigilant smoke detector...
1734 2018-03-01 20:31:36 I disagree w/u on just about everything u write, but I can't agree w/u more on this. @JerryFalwellJr is 1 more snake oil salesman, bowing 2 whichever groups can help him line his pockets. PS - @USAGSessions isn't Session's real account. The best I can tell, he doesn't have one.
1735 2018-03-01 20:31:15 Natural Beauty Tip for Dark Circles:- 

Mix 2 drops of jasmine essential oil and 2 tablespoons of either olive, almond, or vegetable oil. 

Apply to the affected area and gently massage for 3 – 4 minutes.

Leave for 20 – 30 minutes and rinse with lukewarm water.
1736 2018-03-01 20:31:11 I have theories that he had to fire his chef. He posted a photo last week of himself cooking a bone-in ribeye and he didnt post photos of the steak finished. Because the pan wasn't hot and he included no oil (which any chef worth his salt would know) I think theres no chef.
1737 2018-03-01 20:31:04 @Honda at what oil % do bring my car in for a change?
1738 2018-03-01 20:30:59 Keep the oil in the ground? What are you going to use petroleum based products? Alberta is beautiful BTW.
1739 2018-03-01 20:30:44 OIL DIFF: 2.97 -> 3.04
1740 2018-03-01 20:30:42 lets see what happened to our family during the discovery of oil eh...

Please give me money!

1743 2018-03-01 20:30:17 Shave that shit bro. Then oil it up or something
1744 2018-03-01 20:30:17 I apologize, Tom, I just remember when I was young and the interest rates for our little oil company was 22%. I know how hard it is. Thank you, for your hard work.
1745 2018-03-01 20:29:57 And Iran exports a LOT of oil…
1746 2018-03-01 20:29:53 Olive oil is terrible for your heart. Wouldn’t suggest that for someone that had a heart attack.
1747 2018-03-01 20:29:51 Bend over reps. Oil and gas are in the house!
1748 2018-03-01 20:29:51 I chomp they ass off every time just change my fucking oil bra dets it 
1749 2018-03-01 20:29:50 Perfect

Boil madi.. Add pasta oil and salt. Let it simmer until your pasta is cooked through

White sauce- heat butter on low heat once it melted add flour then milk and any cheese of your choice. Stir until. It becomes thick

Then cook your mince how you prefer it
1750 2018-03-01 20:29:46 They also have maintenance and upkeep cost.  The oil/lubricants are pretty expensive as well.  I hope they turn a profit and do good but don't think they are the chosen one we are looking for.  The avian cost is also a huge downside for me personally.
1751 2018-03-01 20:29:46 Well it depends... are they oil based pastels or acrylic? Because then it makes ALL the difference
1752 2018-03-01 20:29:44 Got a oil change and my new radiator put in
1753 2018-03-01 20:29:39 Mesut Oil is the highest paid in @Arsenal yet he doesn't turn up for big games. You can blame Wenger, but when he had d likes of chamak and Bendthner, it wasn't as bad as this

1756 2018-03-01 20:29:23 And what about clean energy? As opposed to oil and gas and coal which are poisoning us
1757 2018-03-01 20:29:14 Rn I'm using clinique cuz it's my winter shade it's really nice it's in my top 3..for summer I was using a body shop foundation with tea tree oil for my pimples Thts really good too...on a regular day I just conceal my dark spots nd set with translucent powder
1758 2018-03-01 20:29:12 Growing up, oil rigs were my jungle gym lol I can 100% relate to that song
1759 2018-03-01 20:29:10 You can make a blooming onion just like they did in the olden days: with a paring knife, a pot of boiling oil, and a street urchin with a high pain threshold to drop the onion in and run from the oil spatter. Added bonus: you can use the hot oil to repel invaders from your home.
1760 2018-03-01 20:29:07 National Security hawks in the 90's : We HAVE to buy middle east oil! National Security is at risk! We can't drill!!
Same National Security Hawks: We are now energy independent and don't NEED middle east oil!
1761 2018-03-01 20:29:00 CDB Oil treats numerous ailments without any side effects Make insurance companies pay for both marijuana and CDB Oil The opioid usage will go down.

1764 2018-03-01 20:28:32 Natural Beauty Tip for Dark Circles:- 

Apply coconut oil to the affected area and gently massage for 2 – 3 minutes before going to sleep. 

Leave overnight and rinse with water the next morning.
1765 2018-03-01 20:28:26 Must be. Like oil and vinegar for salad dressing. Motor oil.
1766 2018-03-01 20:28:24 The good idea is to keep the oil in the ground and spend the money developing clean energy. Use your skilled workers dev those energy sources. You have already destroyed your land. Use that wasteland wisely-solar,wind. Alberta could be leading the way instead of an embarrassment
1767 2018-03-01 20:28:09 @RealMsRenay Coconut oil is great for keeping hair well moisturized.
1768 2018-03-01 20:27:54 In the past few weeks there have been small oil spills in and around Esquimalt, Gilford Island, BC which is a warning that spills do happen. The pipeline you are proposing is a far bigger risk to our beautiful coastline. No way should we take that chance.
1769 2018-03-01 20:27:52 Rub a little olive oil over the skin of a russet, wrap them in aluminum foil, bake for ninety to a hundred and twenty minutes.  Serve with lots of butter, cheese, and sour cream.

Delicious.
1770 2018-03-01 20:27:47 Who is Rex Tillerson? An oil baron.

What does Venezuela have? The world’s largest untapped oil reserves.

What does Iran have? The world’s fourth largest untapped oil reserves.

This isn’t complicated.
1771 2018-03-01 20:27:40 Every time I go get a oil change they always tryna find a list of shit wrong with my car tryna cap
1772 2018-03-01 20:27:31 ive done both oral and "oil" and find oil better. purely because i can vary it, still needs the b6 with it though.

If not, how comes?
1779 2018-03-01 20:26:54 It's not a general election it's a decision for the next 50 years or so. Given which we might have expected a responsible campaign to help us make our decisions. Instead we got charlatans and snake oil salesmen, so it's hardly surprising some of us refuse to accept the result.
1780 2018-03-01 20:26:43 You score more :D Tbh, its clear that Arsenal have space to play around City’s area. They just can’t. Like that Oil chance just now…
1781 2018-03-01 20:26:39 "@FoxNews got it right - why is NOBODY talking about how the ape got to the top of the scaffolding?  HIDING!  Those oil barrels are obviously too flammable.  If it was beautiful, clean coal - wouldn't be happening.   WHERE IS THE DONKEY? #TrumpVideoGameComplaints

1786 2018-03-01 20:26:05 Right now, on Directv,  Ch. 342,  there is a good doc on Scott Pruitt & others polluting and plundering for oil & gas companies. Cancer clusters all around, Arkansas river so polluted fish kills are common. Pruitt signed letter to POTUS Obama telling him to back off regulations.
1787 2018-03-01 20:26:02 oh I love it! must try the oil thx @mandysmith_moir
1788 2018-03-01 20:25:44 ¿Ya hay dos bandos en el segundo tipo, no? Los que se lo atribuyen todo a Soros, el Deep State y a Big Tech y los que le atribuyen todo a Murdoch, Putin y Big Oil. 
1789 2018-03-01 20:25:43 I hate getting oil changes 
1790 2018-03-01 20:25:36 Process for conv vs unconv looks similar at a high level but it’s really not.

Higher commodity price means higher OFS costs. That’s why $100 & $50 oil results in same basic margins for shale producers. For conventional plays, less of an issue b/c of shorter capex window.
1791 2018-03-01 20:25:28 Yes. And much more.

Illegal monopolies can be broken up by the government as they have been in the past. Standard Oil and AT&T never abused their power as Big Tech has and yet they were dismantled for the public good.
1792 2018-03-01 20:25:13 Okay, just got refused service after waiting for an oil change for 45 min. because they think mini’s are “annoying” to work on. WTH???
1793 2018-03-01 20:24:57 If City were as good to watch as Gary Neville says they are, every ground would be bursting to capacity to watch em but, it’s the exact opposite. Fans have no interest in a team built with oil money. A greedy manager & greedy players playing efficient football. Dull, dull, dull.
1794 2018-03-01 20:24:56 I think I'll stop putting oil in my car, it's a waste of money, I still expect the engine to run without any friction whatsoever though. If there is any friction it is BMW's fault for being in the EU and I shall stop paying for it until  they make it work. #BrexitLogic #FBPE
1795 2018-03-01 20:24:55 Here's how analysts see Premier Oil plc (OTCMKTS:PMOIY) after this past wee...
1796 2018-03-01 20:24:52 ساهم نوعا معينا من البكتيريا "oil/marine bacteria " في معالجة وامتصاص جزء كبير من تسرب النفط في خليج المكسيك عام 2010  والبكتريا كانت إحدى الحلول البيئية للتخلص من النفط المتسرب.
1797 2018-03-01 20:24:52 We're sorry to hear about your experience. Car Scented Oil is now sold by Kraco who licenses the Glade name. We'd want to be sure you get in touch with them directly so they may learn more about your experience. Please give them a call 1-832-628-2838.
1798 2018-03-01 20:24:50 Nobody should believe this dictator clown!! How can a coin backed by barrels of oil be mineable??? Does this mean that if I mine a coin, a barrel of oil automatically gets created also? #Venezuela needs to adopt other cryptocurrencies like #Digibyte.
1799 2018-03-01 20:24:49 Give a team oil, $300m in the bank, and 5 years of history and you get this AIDS fest.
1800 2018-03-01 20:24:42 Some industrial users are on interruptible contracts becuase they can burn gas oil as back up. Not sure what u mean by “micro Power station “ as microturbines are tiny.
1801 2018-03-01 20:24:39 Something something 200 million I voted brexit something something Arab oil bought the league I'm a racist
1802 2018-03-01 20:24:37 Completely agree... He's supposedly saving us all this money with the new "tax savings" ... but damnit if we aren't paying it back through solar, steel, aluminum, Mexican made products & produce, gas and oil (those prices are soaring this winter). 
The GOP is just a HUGE scam.
1803 2018-03-01 20:24:11 They like fat, and the oil is solid at these temps so they won't get it on their feathers? I will mix it with dry oats
1804 2018-03-01 20:24:09 @TommyGunsBarber What do you recommend, Beard balm or beard oil, for a new beard?By new I mean less than a month of growth. Thanks. #beard
1805 2018-03-01 20:24:09 @benproc @ElectricRoadmap states that "one of the best things we can do to protect the long-term national security of the U.S. is to electrify our transportation sector and thus rely less on foreign oil and related policies" #UNCCTS18
1806 2018-03-01 20:24:06 Coal is deader than a dodo. Like the notion of "peak oil", it is now more an issue of acceptability. And people know clean coal is BS.
1807 2018-03-01 20:23:54 but its like £10 for a bottle that lasts a few weeks, when you can buy enough raw magnesium chloride to last a year for that. 

(can vary the strength of the "oil" then as well - its not actually an oil)
1808 2018-03-01 20:23:53 Are Analysts Bullish about Premier Oil plc (OTCMKTS:PMOIY) after last wee...
1809 2018-03-01 20:23:37 City has never been relevant before the oil money. So they can't really fwel the missing pain of something they never experienced.
1810 2018-03-01 20:23:34 I'm in love wearing dresses I have some spaghetti smootie I love for us to me do you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
1811 2018-03-01 20:23:30 NO 

btw:

Chris, you need to take on the Rapture Dreams types on YouTube 

who claim that Graham 's death is a "sign of the soon rapture" doctrine 

that 

Barry Scarbrough

Midnight Hour Oil aka Melissa ???

and others like those 2 on YT has been peddling (among other stuff)
1812 2018-03-01 20:23:30 It’s not really an achievement winning the league after spending half a billion pounds of oil money on 17 players and then juicing them all up. #ARSMAN
1813 2018-03-01 20:23:28 It's not a matter of "strike oil" but you have to compare economic opportunities that exacerbate outmigration.  If you live in Latin America or Africa, you leave because there's nothing left, no social net, nada.  Puerto Rico still part of the US - rebuild will create opportunity
1814 2018-03-01 20:23:26 I’ll throw an alternate out there to @Hugdog18 - add in some chopped pecans, olive oil, garlic salt and when they come out of the oven drizzle honey over. Perfect salty and sweet combo. Love them his way too
1815 2018-03-01 20:22:58 America needs to make it's own iron steel and aluminum. Just like we needed our own oil production. For our own defence imo
1816 2018-03-01 20:22:53 Haha.... oil satin lol 
1817 2018-03-01 20:22:49 Cold and flu tablets,olbas oil,and strepsils on repeat rnoh life you never fail to impress me xx
1818 2018-03-01 20:22:46 Lucas Oil Stadium! On a road trip to a basketball camp in S. Indiana, my friends & I decided to see if we could take a tour. Tours weren't going on, so we tried a side door & sunk in. A few twists and turns later we were out on the field, watching guys catch balls! #CWTickets
1819 2018-03-01 20:22:40 long for the day a massive oil rich cunt who screwed over his pal buys up Spurs and turns us into Barca from 2011
1820 2018-03-01 20:22:35 Clean Coal, yea right. No FACTS here..for the Fox News crew facts get in the way of propaganda...Drain the swamp, right. There is a pipeline and it is not oil, running right to the EDA, Environmental Destruction Agency formally the EPA @nytimes @washingtonpost @cnn @SierraClub
1821 2018-03-01 20:22:29 Laura the Paragon maintains the oil and food inside the pan at the precise temperature. For example, you could keep chocolate melted in the pan for days without it ever hardening or scorching!
1822 2018-03-01 20:22:24 omg!! u should honestly try tea tree oil on your blemishes! thats what ive been doing on stress breakouts
1823 2018-03-01 20:22:21 The numbers just concerning MF that the province will have to pay out in the next few years is staggering. Unless oil takes a huge jump it will be a "very scary future" as you have said.
1824 2018-03-01 20:22:18 Oil best years done a Madrid...how long ago was that again? 
1825 2018-03-01 20:22:12 Fucking oil merchants
1826 2018-03-01 20:22:09 But peak oil
1827 2018-03-01 20:22:02 Disposable income is UP, Joblessness at a 49 yr old low, US crude production up making the US less dependent on the Middle East for oil, the no of Medicaid recipients has dropped, the no. of illegals crossing the border has dropped 40-70%:..go POTUS!
1828 2018-03-01 20:21:59 I might go back to the oil sector at the end of this year...
as a consultant this time, but that will mean a lot of  flying hours
what I called the pain triangle, [Benghazi Tripoli Wafa-Field] ಥ_ಥ
1829 2018-03-01 20:21:59 Just a reminder- Trump (?) handpicked Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of State. An accomplished oil executive with very, very close ties to Putin and Russia. How much more f’ed up is that sounding now?
1830 2018-03-01 20:21:49 If you believe there is going to be a V-curve in those economic fundamentals, if you believe Puerto Rico is going to "strike oil" metaphorically speaking, great! But forecasting that is not my job. My job is to tell you who/how many are going to live there under given conditions
1831 2018-03-01 20:21:48 Packing the bus is a thing every coach need to learn  its very very important. Have y'all noticed that "teams that play beautiful attractive football" always catch a heavy L against Oil Money FC
1832 2018-03-01 20:21:41 90% of the wealth is from oil, we shud go down and aks for the money
1833 2018-03-01 20:21:40 Lol. Okay. Here:
Wash face with black soap morning and night. Bath soap- Dettol Even Tone.
Apply sunscreen lotion(with coconut oil) in the mornings then coconut oil at night. 
Most importantly, drink lots of water and green tea too. 
That should do I guess
1834 2018-03-01 20:21:28 I now have heating after two weeks with only a tiny oil filled radiator. Huzzah. ∗Proceeds to defrost∗
1835 2018-03-01 20:21:23 Oh almighty omniscient uberhawk. Power and the Passion by Midnight Oil - incredible brass breakdown outro which must be and believe me is turned right up #ends
1836 2018-03-01 20:21:20 Cutting edge girl! You will be tweeting Wintergreen and Masons Dog Oil next. Beyond sexy!!!!

1839 2018-03-01 20:21:09 Crude Oil is leading us off the lows,
1840 2018-03-01 20:20:50 cant wait until she begs fracking companys to frack because scotland had no oil left and its poor HAHAHAHA
don't worry, westminster will save scotland again by legalising fracking
1841 2018-03-01 20:20:42 #AlbertaDisadvandecage 
The ucp is Still stuck in the past.
The #NDP is improving the lives of Albertans that have stayed during boom n bust of the past 3 decades. 
3 decades of conservatibe administration have led us to depend on oil. 
Say no to UCP administration of oil & gas.
1842 2018-03-01 20:20:41 You know we will get 1st overall ( the oil)
1843 2018-03-01 20:20:40 Why am I crying over the fact that the oil industry gives you good money but is so dangerous and bad for the environment

this is not a normal thing for a 17 y/o to be crying about
 send help
1844 2018-03-01 20:20:24 I'm betting on US production creating yet another glut with shale oil now than both Brent and WTI are above the $50 threshold.
1845 2018-03-01 20:20:21 Not only high paying jobs in the oil industry,but other employers in the oil production area have to pay higher wages to be competitive.
1846 2018-03-01 20:20:11 I layered some weed kief oil and more weed in a bowl last night, and lemme tell ya
1847 2018-03-01 20:20:07 My first attempt at creating a “true fried egg” has ended in catastrophe. The egg is fine but half a bottle of oil emptied on the floor.
1848 2018-03-01 20:20:06 Waiting two hours for an oil change, because I have nothing better to do with my Thursday 
1849 2018-03-01 20:20:02 What paint are you using Johnny? Is it oil? I know you use a lot of it
1850 2018-03-01 20:19:54 I just started supplementing ZMA. I was wondering if it was the same reasons I take for, which is the reasons you listed. I wasn’t sure if using Magnesium Oil had any uses I wasn’t aware of. Always learning haha
1851 2018-03-01 20:19:52 I’m using my pen rn an i made the terrible choice to mix hemp oil and regular pen juice and it’s sooo gross. Why did i do that?
1852 2018-03-01 20:19:52 Possibly concentrating on the 1% (with view to appropriation or massive taxation) to the exclusion of more normal areas is making the same mistake as Ghana made with oil; concentrating on one small resource area, with consequent huge problems.
1853 2018-03-01 20:19:39 Guessing that Chinese delivery of tight oil helped.
1854 2018-03-01 20:19:34 Food colouring more dense than oil x
1855 2018-03-01 20:19:23 But even *that* only hints at the issue. @tomfriedman spent the last several years repeatedly reciting that losing your place in the supply chain was "like pouring cement down an oil well."

You never get your place in the supply chain *back.*
1856 2018-03-01 20:19:17 We got more snow today too. Baby oil on our paws & legs seemed to work a bit better so not so many snowballs attached!
1857 2018-03-01 20:19:16 Beautiful goal right there from Oil Money FC

1871 2018-03-01 20:17:25 We agree! A healthy diet can include Extra Virgin Olive Oil to stay healthy and live your greatest life! #Bellucci @BellucciPremium
1872 2018-03-01 20:17:25 Ensuring independence in steel, oil, aluminum, and other primary industrial resource production are vital to National security, longevity and prosperity.
1873 2018-03-01 20:17:24 Your work and opinions are worthless. You sold out precious Alaskan wilderness to oil companies. You are a POS and do NOT work for the good of the American people. Time to leave office.
1874 2018-03-01 20:17:22 So here I goo
1875 2018-03-01 20:17:14 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
1876 2018-03-01 20:16:58 A2 No clue on this one but they grow a lot of olives in Greece right so guessing rubbing olive oil on their feet?? #parentpubquiz
1877 2018-03-01 20:16:54 I ordered oil 2 weeks ago from @Boilerjuice. Today when I finally managed to talk to someone in their customer support team I was told non their suppliers were delivering, there was no oil in the depots and they had no system for prioritising deliveries when conditions improve!
1878 2018-03-01 20:16:30 It’s a heinous scenario when it has been known that resources are finite & we could have shifted to #GreenEnergy already. Oil tycoons can’t remove the crude IV from their bank accounts knowing full well it is society at large & planet that will pay dearly for their greed.

1880 2018-03-01 20:16:20 A soundbite from this evening's dinner table: 
"DID YOU JUST CALL MY BOYFRIEND A KIDNEY BEAN!!!" 
"That's the highest compliment I've given a boy you've dated... I think I rubbed pizza oil all over my face" 
"Alex I am the teller of all things okay. I know everything."
1881 2018-03-01 20:16:19 Gold expected t posensialy bounce f 1301, but after hitting 1305 hard takes a short term bottoming at 1304. Upturn having effect on indices & oil etc, etc. Short lived.
1882 2018-03-01 20:16:18 Hey @VanessaGrimaldi I heard you on #offthevine try castor oil for your eyelashes. I simply buy castor oil and an empty mascara container from Amazon! Super cheap and works great!
1883 2018-03-01 20:16:08 If you struggle with dark circles, use Sweet Almond Oil On A Fresh Face Every Evening and Gently Massage Around Your Eyes.

1885 2018-03-01 20:15:55 Yeah true, Sharpton sold out the black community for his own benefit and he is trying to find relevance. I believe the black community are opening their eyes and no longer falling for the sleight of hand trick from a slimy snake oil salesman anymore. His deceit has been uncovered
1886 2018-03-01 20:15:54 A2. C run oil on their feet #parentpubquiz

1893 2018-03-01 20:15:28 It also has to do with the gov's neglect of these industries (and other like it, asbestos/oil) Trudeau's proposed to place insane regulation to hinder their success when they're already being hurt by Trump's NAFTA decision

I like peaty, salty spray, oil refinery, old rubber boots whiskies, so this tea is, well, just my cup of tea! 
1897 2018-03-01 20:15:20 We're all getting paid

You can save the nation
There's double headed snakes out here

1901 2018-03-01 20:14:53 Apparently tea tree oil = poison
1902 2018-03-01 20:14:36 Old article. The original articles published that day said the tanker had Russian oil—as well as—the oil we bought, which was from another country (forget where). I don’t know the truth of it though. Nothing surprises me.
1903 2018-03-01 20:14:32 Wenger & Arsenal. Water & Oil
1904 2018-03-01 20:14:27 Btw ya karena muka belum beres ku jadi tak sempat menyentuh rambut dan badan. Baru sadar pas browsing exfo toner trus nemu innisfree hair oil dan semacam “oiya ya. Mbut apa kabar”

Mbut rambut.
1905 2018-03-01 20:14:11 Trump’s cabinet is full of people from the oil coal and gas industry never mind the big cheese at the top from Exxon. What I don’t get is all of these MAGA dopes whonthink he “drained the swamp”? How do they logically believe this?!
1906 2018-03-01 20:13:58 I put a little castor oil on them or wheat germ oil but for the most part I’m taking powdered msm and liquid biotin and a b vitamin complex. For the most part I’m just letting them chill. I think it’s been like 4 months now
1907 2018-03-01 20:13:52 Just pump more oil, much more oil.
1908 2018-03-01 20:13:52 Seeing my sister 2015 Equinox truck engine blow because she ain't get her oil changed made me get up and go get my shit changed quick asl.
1909 2018-03-01 20:13:51 I know he’s only 4 buuuuut I taught Theron how to change oil haha
1910 2018-03-01 20:13:48 Arsenal is trash  this is why Mourinho packs the bus, you can't be this open against a team like Oil Money FC
1911 2018-03-01 20:13:47 Wow- does he plan to destroy the auto industry, and oil companies  in the south?
1912 2018-03-01 20:13:41 Now my drinks are clean I fill em up wit that oil
1913 2018-03-01 20:13:35 ก็มันไม่ใช่เราไงเข้าใจยัง??

1916 2018-03-01 20:13:06 You see, it can now be said that a inventive, clairvoyant blue-eyed ISTP oil heiress, throwing aside a cerulean beret, whispers mystical confidences into the big soft ear of a friendly and calm Welsh pony.
1917 2018-03-01 20:13:04 why crude oil price high at the end of 5 years ERA :)
1918 2018-03-01 20:12:56 As is your oil and water. Just saying from 
1919 2018-03-01 20:12:52 Well, I honestly thought the biggest "oops" moment of the whole season was the second Richmond race, where a pace car actually blew up a motor, letting out oil, Nascar not detecting that oil in time, causing that 3-car crash.
1920 2018-03-01 20:12:47 @seanhannity record level oil production great for "independence" not so great for price / barrel to increase.  Need that Trump economy to boom!
1921 2018-03-01 20:12:37 "He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land, your grain, new wine and olive oil, the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you." Deuteronomy 7:13

1923 2018-03-01 20:12:22 @PameAlaTarde el fondo de jubilaciones no sólo tiene aportes de los trabajadores activos sino también el 100% del impuesto al gas oil y el 21% de las naftas
1924 2018-03-01 20:12:21 @SenCarmichaelWV  put a sin tax out there on tobacco & alcohol and minimally increase severance tax on gas & oil
1925 2018-03-01 20:12:20 Tea tree oil and coconut facial mist!

1928 2018-03-01 20:11:51 some good news for today

the U.S. Oil Production has just hit an all time high at 10 million barrels being produced today

the last time it was that high was in November of 1974 (i believe)

this is BIG news for so many reasons
1929 2018-03-01 20:11:35 @FordService My 2013 Focus has been at the dealer for over 3 weeks to get an oil leak and possibly a new clutch. They have not been able to tell me when the car will be ready for the past 2 weeks. What can I do? I want my car back 100%.
1930 2018-03-01 20:10:55 I have pants on my head. Again. And now a throw over my back & head. Rather glad the hairdresser didn't turn up yday.  My ears & head are cold enough.  Oil filled rad doing FUCK ALL
1931 2018-03-01 20:10:55 Coconut oil!!! It lifts it and soothes it. I’ve used it for a while and my scalp is just constantly getting better 
1932 2018-03-01 20:10:34 Need to remind big oil that they got a pass on tne carcinogenic MTBE liability for switching to ethanol as an oxygenate.
1933 2018-03-01 20:10:31 Simple as that!!!
Don't just let this ABU stuff get over your head tho.

1934 2018-03-01 20:10:23 Pack that coconut oil 
1935 2018-03-01 20:10:13 Lost six followers since tweeting about writing at the ford garage.  Some folks must really hate oil changes.
1936 2018-03-01 20:10:10 What about the oil, water and fuel?
1937 2018-03-01 20:10:08 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
1938 2018-03-01 20:10:07 Just let them put some oil refineries in... common sense right?
1939 2018-03-01 20:10:07 Crude oil production in the United States has now hit an all time high
1940 2018-03-01 20:09:56 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
1941 2018-03-01 20:09:49 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1942 2018-03-01 20:09:48 @AbuWahidLabour Inspired what by? A gulag-mad worker-manipulative collectivist Socialist twit? Socialism destroys lives 190 million killed in the name of the people ! Venuezuela massive oil reserves starving dog eating populance ..under ....Socialism !
1943 2018-03-01 20:09:33 Your WCW thinks coconut oil is only for your skin
1944 2018-03-01 20:09:31 #Cat parents will understand why -- after eye-dropping Metamucil and cod liver oil into a sick kitty -- my better half and I are celebrating the fact that kitty finally pooped! To think I would ever be happy about cat poop... SMH
1945 2018-03-01 20:09:28  I want an oil well.
1946 2018-03-01 20:09:22 Hood mechanics and oil pumps . 

Every problem ke "oil pump"
1947 2018-03-01 20:09:17 It’s crazy how countries from around the world come pick up or drop off oil in corpus
1948 2018-03-01 20:09:06 Absolutely hate getting my oil changed
1949 2018-03-01 20:08:59 I don't know. I still take various forms like Flaxseed oil and hemp oil but these don't seem to have the beneficial effect they have on other people. Enjoy the coconut milk - great in coffee, if you drink it :-)
1950 2018-03-01 20:08:56 @meagersunlight and I are separated by distance but connected mentally due to fish oil consumption.
1951 2018-03-01 20:08:52 Lol. My parents taught me manners.  My dad taught me how to shoot, change a tire and change the oil on my car, too. My handshake is firm.
1952 2018-03-01 20:08:51 If you don't think 18-year-olds are mature enough to own an AK-47 or an AR-15, then quit sending them to war to die for oil. 
1953 2018-03-01 20:08:41 Oil apparently playing for a contract has since reverted to his shitty worst since signing. Absolute nitwits
1954 2018-03-01 20:08:29 Ok Get d message I'm trying to pass. That's all
1955 2018-03-01 20:08:22 dont worry Kurt, most educated people dont watch Fox. most can see thru the snake oil sales pitch. The only people in PA that watch fox is because they r too lazy to work & pay for cable & can get fox by putting an antenna on their roof.
1956 2018-03-01 20:08:17 "Where are you from?" 
"Texas"
"Where in Texas?"
"Fort Worth"
"Do you ride a horse to work?"
"No. Don't be stupid."
"Well, do you at least own an oil well?"
"Four."
1957 2018-03-01 20:08:02 So I bought an oil cleanser to double cleanse with at night and I feel like I'm living a life that @sixinchheels_ would approve of.
1958 2018-03-01 20:08:00 Not to be the bearer of bad news but I think a lot of this is shale oil wells which deplete fast. Let's hope we get new "real" oil as well.
1959 2018-03-01 20:07:45 Why does my phone hate me. It started a Facebook live....well I was paying for my oil change and talking to myself
1960 2018-03-01 20:07:39 Kfb @Madame_Flowy
1961 2018-03-01 20:07:39 & this is why you don’t fucking mix family and business together it’s like water and oil not a good mix I’ve told you fools time and time again but nobody listens to osito huh ? #Pendejos
1962 2018-03-01 20:07:36 Better yet, Canada and China WILL respond in kind. How about energy tariffs (oil, natural gas and electricity) from Canada and soy tariffs from China?
1963 2018-03-01 20:07:12 Lol when you cut off a nation’s oil like America did to Japan you get bombed 

Trump is living in 1950s dementiaville. 

Putting a tax of that size in allies and key trading partners is “Russian” roulette 

(See what I did there)
1964 2018-03-01 20:06:58 #sayyesto kale, water and coconut oil mousse is awesome!
1965 2018-03-01 20:06:47 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1966 2018-03-01 20:06:33 @MBMBaM I spilled febreze oil on my purse and now it smells overwhelmingly of febreze. How do you remove the smell of febreze, when febreze is what is supposed to remove smells...?¿

1972 2018-03-01 20:05:48 I’m pretty sure I’m right.., but the tire place tried tellin me I’m 5,500 OVER on an oil change, but I have full synthetic.. & I’m 2,000 over UNLESS I read it wrong
1973 2018-03-01 20:05:47 Have you tried defusing essential oils?  “Another major headache trigger is stress, which can be reduced by using lavender and peppermint oil aromatically.”
1974 2018-03-01 20:05:47 Leave it to arabs to find the most unhealthiest way to cook tofu (dripping oil and more salt than salt itself), and then they act so surprised when the get kidney stones or heart attacks...
1975 2018-03-01 20:05:38 I pour a few tbsp of olive oil or dabs of butter over every meal. And generally a late afternoon snack of jerky or soft cheese. But that’s it.
1976 2018-03-01 20:05:12 I think he's more than a mouth piece. Also, the aspire thing is Qatari oil money, a bit above our league

1980 2018-03-01 20:05:03 Oil doesn't come from dinosaurs.
1981 2018-03-01 20:04:59 And the most important thing is getting our oil to shoreline so we can pay for the program! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THAT?
1982 2018-03-01 20:04:58 My gas light is on & my oil light say 5% 
1983 2018-03-01 20:04:44 Pretty cool and a testament to getting your oil changed regularly but a little concerned with anyone still driving at 102 yrs old.
1984 2018-03-01 20:04:38 Time to fire the Moron In Chief who continues to live in the 19th century. Being in bed with the oil industry is almost as bad as being in bed with the NRA...Oil and trump will kill our country in the near future.
1985 2018-03-01 20:04:18 love that i have a special place for them in my heart especially vetiver honestlyI love this balance oil so much but I really miss the first version of it!!
1986 2018-03-01 20:04:10 25% of you need to turn off CNN. The other 25% need to stop getting their talking points from late night TV. You talk about evil corporations but drive cars that run on gas and oil take pills from big Pharma and eat food from companion farms. Hypocrites
1987 2018-03-01 20:04:08 Boiler died last night so have no heating til plumber can get here tomorrow morning! Sat in bed with hoodie, scarf and gloves! Little oil filled radiator is trying to heat my bedroom #beastfromtheeast #snow #cold #duvetday #cuppatea
1988 2018-03-01 20:04:04 there are only 2 amounts of pasta:

bottom of the bag, when you don't know what to eat. Usually with jar pesto, butter+parmesan, or oil+garlic+chili
half a bag, for when you want leftovers. Carbonara, mac&cheese, more elaborate shit

literally no other options
1989 2018-03-01 20:04:03 We have already hit the key tipping point where new solar/wind are cheaper than new coal plants.

Coal is effectively finished as an energy source - top 4 US producers lost 99% value in 5 years. Gas & oil are on the same path.
1990 2018-03-01 20:03:42 Underutilization of resources.
They spin so fast, we could use them as dynamos.
We'd never need gas / oil / coal EVER again.
AGW solved!
1991 2018-03-01 20:03:41 Our oil pipe burst today. Its been a long day.
1992 2018-03-01 20:03:33 Y'all ever use coconut oil while having sex?

1995 2018-03-01 20:03:19 So pissed off that my vegan margarine has palm oil in it I'm just trying to save the planet what more can a girl do
1996 2018-03-01 20:03:18 Why do we import anything that we make here? Materials oil gas medicines etc.. import what we need, export our overflow
1997 2018-03-01 20:03:11 I'm gonna get back on it when my diet starts. It does work.gonna start using more coconut oil too
1998 2018-03-01 20:03:08 Charmaine you worth this $80+ oil change 
1999 2018-03-01 20:02:50 In mid-2014, 25% of Russia's economy & 50% of her government revenues came from oil/gas.

Russia exports oil, gas & weapons.

2002 2018-03-01 20:02:29 In the context of the teachers strike over demands for a fix to PEIA and larger salary increases, @Ojeda4congress has spent the day rallying against the oil and gas industry. He's said repeatedly that tax increases on that industry would help solve the state's issues.

2007 2018-03-01 20:02:02 Delivering garden furniture or bricks is not essential, essential deliveries need to get through, however, when a lorry delivering non essential goods blocks and closes a major artery stopping the heating oil and feed getting through then your argument fails
2008 2018-03-01 20:01:58 I think you’re safe. If Russia invaded, who would build their cars? Buy their oil & natgas?

2011 2018-03-01 20:01:43 And perhaps our over reliance on crude oil
2012 2018-03-01 20:01:40 Okay so regarding NAFTA since currently the US obtains Canadian oil without import fees perhaps Trudeau should add some fees you know so the countries are equal and all. 
2013 2018-03-01 20:01:26 Steel tariffs won't create jobs, just the opposite. Companies that use steel will be hurt.  Oil drillers and storage, car makers, etc.
2014 2018-03-01 20:01:22 Most private rotary pilots are vets, I think.  We have a dear friend who got the many of his hours in sandy places but who flies privately, now. Did oil rigs for several years. From talking to him, most of his coworkers are similar. @blkntandogs can correct me if I’m wrong.

2024 2018-03-01 20:00:44 I also have the face oil which I don’t use because I didn’t like how greasy it felt, but she advised to either rub s drop into fingers then onto face of just add a drop to my cream for extra dry patches (nose for me), so I’m going to give that a try too
2025 2018-03-01 20:00:38 Encourage self sufficiency like if you can have an oil rig in your backyard don't buy it from Asia
2026 2018-03-01 20:00:34 Don’t worry Canada is only ur 2nd highest trading partner.  Only ur number 1 source of imported oil.  Don’t worry it will be ok. #NAFTA
2027 2018-03-01 20:00:33 I think absurd is the right word to describe a Labour party under Corbyn that applauds socialist policy that has bankrupted oil rich Venezuela, provides a forum for antisemitic extremists without repercussions, and ignores the views of its core voters on Brexit. That is absurd.
2028 2018-03-01 20:00:28 Got home to find out the boilers died and so we have no heating. The cherry on the cake is that my dad has bought a oil radiator for the DOG. WHAT ABOUT ME 
2029 2018-03-01 20:00:21 A sovereign wealth fund can buy up excess barrels to blunt a momentary sell off but does nothing re: basic demand.
   
And eventually, anyone trying this will run out of money. There are ways to do it, but you can only store so much oil.
2030 2018-03-01 20:00:18 Today I started manufacturing the first 55-gallon steel oil drum. Robert would be so proud.

2032 2018-03-01 20:00:07 World uses 80-million+ barrels of oil/day. 5% drop in economy = drop of 4-million+/day. 10% = 8-million+.
   
Any significant drop in oil demand in, say, 2018 will decimate the industry further.
2033 2018-03-01 20:00:07 I've got this and the resurfacing oil it's amaze balls!

-Vitamin C serum mixed with moisturizer in the morning

-Glycolic acid serum mixed with facial oil at night before bed

It's going to take time to lighten the discolorations, but it's a start.

2055 2018-03-01 19:58:05 Where did these billions come from?

30 billion dollars out of commission on sale of oil
2 billion dollars in land dealings
6 billion dollars in arms dealings                

10 billion dollars has been directly paid to Khamenei by Ahmadinejad's government

2057 2018-03-01 19:57:45 I was gonna get my oil changed after work but little did i know that my window was gonna be shattered lol
2058 2018-03-01 19:57:43 First off, supplements should only be used after you get the nutrition right. I remember being super big on supps. I’ve found that they don’t really make a huge difference if your diet is crap. So I’ve gotten it down to the basics multivitamin, fish oil, pre/post workout
2059 2018-03-01 19:57:30 Do we have confirmation that this is true?  I'm no expert, but I would imagine this type of weapons development would require huge R&D outlays and with oil prices where they are, isn't Russian economy tanking?
2060 2018-03-01 19:57:28 coconut oil & vitamin E has given my face and hair soooooo much life omg
2061 2018-03-01 19:57:16 So finally managed to contact someone from @Boilerjuice. Apparently they don't know when my oil will be delivered, there are currently no tankers delivering oil as none are on the road,  when the tankers (that aren't on the road) get to the depots there is no oil !
2062 2018-03-01 19:57:16 Vote NO =

Doesn't US politics has a role on this??
Or, Do the oil companies has any role on this situation which they have huge influence on US politics??
2064 2018-03-01 19:57:12 IMO, there are lots of examples of him doing the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing in both #ManofSteel (the oil rig, soldiers that just shot at him, the bus) and #BatmanvSuperman (the girl in the fire, the shuttle, even saving Lex from Doomsday).
2065 2018-03-01 19:57:08 Yes, I loved that quote. Nigeria out of recession! Barely 1% growth and mostly from the oil sector. That's not enough when you have 3% population growth.
2066 2018-03-01 19:57:07 Are you sure he isn't pointing out where he wants the next oil and gas wells drilled on Federal property
2067 2018-03-01 19:57:04 “That is a significant amount of oil you’re burning...”

“Don’t worry about it, I’m just lubricating the air.” -@CloppyP
2068 2018-03-01 19:57:03 everyone loves the nuxe oil
2069 2018-03-01 19:57:01 Yup, of hemp oil and patchouli 
2070 2018-03-01 19:56:54 Cool thank you! I've been putting eardrops and oil in for a few weeks as an attempted home remedy but it's failed.

I think I'll have to get it done privately  but I'll go to see him just to be sure.
2071 2018-03-01 19:56:40 Anyone left in oil will be selling feedstocks & lubricants.

Which brings us back to Russia.
2072 2018-03-01 19:56:29 No, China controls the capacity, they are the marginal or swing producer and thus set the price.  No different then US  shale being the swing producer in the oil market
2073 2018-03-01 19:56:20 Yes we are out of recession, but not as a result of sound economic policies from this Govt. Two things improved our GDP growth; 1. Rise of crude oil price 2. The calm in Niger Delta which improved our oil production.
2074 2018-03-01 19:56:20 Could be worse, they could be oil & gas workers that have Canadian Governments willfully damaging their industry competitiveness through lack of infrastructure pipelines, ensuring workers in other countries have a competitive advantage.
2075 2018-03-01 19:56:02 @wyomingtourism You killed and destroyed the breeding of my horses and lab dogs and mother dying of lung cancer at the age of 70 under the American disabitly act over the greed of oil for a profit of c.m.t and now my life is a song a violation of my 4th amendment of privacy.....
2076 2018-03-01 19:55:59 Oil changes expensive as shit moe
2077 2018-03-01 19:55:54 Oh...  But I'm not from Kano 
2078 2018-03-01 19:55:48 With all that implies for energy, commodities, inflation and the economy. And human welfare.

So, oil with an effective cap of $25/barrel or lower vs solar & natural gas that are practically free.
2079 2018-03-01 19:55:46 Well I normally don't buy palm oil. I get from my village
2080 2018-03-01 19:55:40 It’s supply and demand.  Top coaches require top salaries.  Tax subsidies are a separate issue that goes way beyond college Sports to things like farm, oil, ethanol, exports, housing. If that’s your issue then say so. Don’t use it as a back door attack on coaches salaries.
2081 2018-03-01 19:55:31 Coconut oil my baby.. 
2082 2018-03-01 19:55:26 @RichieAllenShow The question is what is the importance of Syria to the Cabal?? It's not oil.
2083 2018-03-01 19:55:19 Oooo I’m loving coconut oil 
2084 2018-03-01 19:55:19 Peter Navarro was always five parts snake oil, one part prof from way, way back. Even us undergrads who snuck into his bullshit lectures at UCSD knew he was a third rate huckster whose research was mostly just 'what if I was onto something' paper napkin nonsense.
2085 2018-03-01 19:55:12 First time I saw it, I laughed out loud. Then I saw it again, then oil fans started commenting and so on and so forth. Now I'm petrified it happens
2086 2018-03-01 19:55:05 Obama sure loved that foreign oil.
2087 2018-03-01 19:54:59 Price of pipes used in the oil and gas energy up 40% according to friend that manages an oil company.
2088 2018-03-01 19:54:57 It’s been prophesied (Mark Taylor) that Israel and USA would lead the world of oil (energy) production- this would help relieve the trillion $ national debt.... 
2089 2018-03-01 19:54:40 I oil my hair way to much 
2090 2018-03-01 19:54:39 They do a little bit on mine or maybe its just regular oil
2091 2018-03-01 19:54:37 We cook with canola oil, no peanuts. Your son is safe here, come-in for the specials this weekend!

2094 2018-03-01 19:53:49 wow fuckin uhhhhhhh the one day i convince myself to change my oil is the one day i don't have time to because i have to go into work early!!!
2095 2018-03-01 19:53:45 We still have coal and oil. No need for your sunshine except to get a tan with.
2096 2018-03-01 19:53:41 Talk to me about the oil. About how it ran out in 2014.
2097 2018-03-01 19:53:32 Oil prices settle at a two-week low
2098 2018-03-01 19:53:28 Man you just made a tweet with #livesustainably in it; these people are trying to do the same thing. Plastic infrastructure is still important but we have viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Oil is a non-renewable resource and we have to smartly allocate what we have left.
2099 2018-03-01 19:53:24 Iont got either except this sheen i got wit olive oil in it 
2100 2018-03-01 19:53:15 Pls have you asked this question on your morning show programme? He can't speak for himself; so you ve to be his 'the twinky wheel who get the oil "..........
2101 2018-03-01 19:53:14 I cleaned my room, finished all my assignments, washed and vacuumed my car and fixed it up with an oil change & new tires. I feel so at ease.
2102 2018-03-01 19:53:12 Niggaaaaa when did oil changes start taking this long 
2103 2018-03-01 19:53:10 @DrTomTakubo as far as the budget that you discussed this afternoon, start by asking J Justice to pay his WV taxes. I see something that you’re not seeing. Severance tax on oil and gas
2104 2018-03-01 19:53:10 So it would be bad if the Chinese began giving us their steel for, say, free? And presumably it would also be bad if the Saudis began giving us their oil for free? Because that's exactly where your logic leads. Union logic = non-logic + UI.
2105 2018-03-01 19:53:10 I will be applying liberal oil on the whole body to protect my body against hard to rinse dyes. #CelebrateHOLIstically
2106 2018-03-01 19:52:59 Live in the Bakabeyond. Central heating is oil, inefficient and dirty, and there's birds in the chimney. So not much use. Many many layers.
2107 2018-03-01 19:52:53 Literally was walking through oil at the gas station and didn’t think twice about my feet being slippery and have stalled 936280 times trying to drive home. I’m gonna kill someone
2108 2018-03-01 19:52:36 Use olive oil or castor oil.
2109 2018-03-01 19:52:33 The US is a net exporter of petroleum products, which is not the same as importing crude oil.
2110 2018-03-01 19:52:33 I just started Tamanu oil! I always put Vitamin c on in the morning and night. 
2111 2018-03-01 19:52:32 @RealAlexJones Snake oil journalist, shit salesman.
2112 2018-03-01 19:52:24 This weekend I plan to:

A. Take my dog to get groomed
B. Get my car inspected, change the oil and replace filters
C. Do my taxes 

I am now a 40 year old man
2113 2018-03-01 19:52:12 As his article and the HSBC report mentions the global economy has been propped up by debt as a substitute for oil but neither oil or debt are sustainable in the long run.
2114 2018-03-01 19:52:09 Pres. @MBuhari: My Administration's economic agenda has always been to move away from over reliance on crude oil & food importation.
2115 2018-03-01 19:51:49 I’m terrified to use my oil paints because I feel like that’s only for professionals and I’m just screwing around with art
2116 2018-03-01 19:51:49 Ha  I’m a die hard gardener but I’ll leave the oil skins on their peg today thanks 
2117 2018-03-01 19:51:38 The babe oil does get a bit tacky when hot.. 
2118 2018-03-01 19:51:38 I went to the post office today, then to the bank, ordered more checks, and now I’m reading an AARP magazine while getting my oil changed during the day on a Thursday. I have never felt more like an old person than I do now.
2119 2018-03-01 19:51:37 Does the blue car need a oil top up again? 
2120 2018-03-01 19:51:27 Castor Oil 
2121 2018-03-01 19:50:58 Love oils. Lately I’ve been mixing a few drops of evening primrose oil with my moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated even in the drying cold weather we’ve been getting. Also use coconut oil for body and OCM, Argan oil for hair, almond oil for body is amazing too.
2122 2018-03-01 19:50:38 the only industries hiring right now in canada are oil, weed and video games. what happened to teletoon. i wanna work for them
2123 2018-03-01 19:50:32 Oil futures slide for third successive US session - #Brent at $63.90/bbl (-1.28%), #WTI at $61.01/bbl (-1.02%); Bears rule on China's demand fears, US production uptick #OOTT #oilandgas
2124 2018-03-01 19:50:22 glad i did stay that long because i finally got some tea tree oil
2125 2018-03-01 19:50:18 @tferriss What are your thoughts on using MCT oil/ketone supplements while eating slow-carb? I loved the cognitive benefits of #keto, but slow-carb seems much more sustainable.

2129 2018-03-01 19:49:50 I’ll take that label with pride....I voted for him once.  He sucked, conflated 9/11 with Iraq and started a dumb war in Iraq (and didn’t even take the oil) that led to ISIS, so I didn’t vote for him the 2nd time.  And time has proven me right because I’m always right! 
2130 2018-03-01 19:49:44 You can pop up and help get our oil defrosted if you like . Oil line is frozen 
2131 2018-03-01 19:49:42 Is there oil under Charlie’s restaurant? #gh
2132 2018-03-01 19:49:32 Assuming you still *want* oil, with clean natural gas generating limitless electricity or pure-silica solar panels.

Clean energy? Raw heat & sand make pure-silica solar panels; less efficient than rare earth, but literally printable… from *sand*

2138 2018-03-01 19:49:13 Your head get oil. I took one sip and discovered it was getting fermented, had to drop it bruh

some pancetta - No
garlic - No
an onion - No
a carrot - No
a few olives - No

2141 2018-03-01 19:48:54 Ginger/Lemon Tea with Honey and a double shot of Whiskey. Drink it as hot as you can stand it.

Also - put 3 drops of Oregano Oil in a shot glass of water and gargle it. Your breath will smell like pizza for a couple days but it'll help! I promise!
2142 2018-03-01 19:48:50 My point is that there are many things giving the market jitters:
1) Post-binge buying profit taking
2) Beginning of the month repositioning
3) Russian nuclear "threat"
4) Oil production up
5) Oil consumption down
6) Steel, aluminum tariffs
7) Strong Unemployment Claims data
2143 2018-03-01 19:48:47 Exciting purchases today include fish oil, a glucosamine supplement, and very cute pink daily pill organizer. Am I 25 or 85? I need to stop these creaky knees.
2144 2018-03-01 19:48:46 Ok. I once lowered Lucas's cholesterol very successfully by adding a little bit of olive oil to every meal. It worked wonders.
2145 2018-03-01 19:48:39 But I have lots of rose oil soap, but there is only one Book.
2146 2018-03-01 19:48:22 It's the one where he walks in slo-mo up a corridor with a little jug of sex oil in his hand
2147 2018-03-01 19:48:18 Hi, thanks for getting back to me, I'd normally just call the garage but couldn't get an answer presumably due to weather perhaps no one was there or gone home early understandably. Will it oil be OK until next week?
2148 2018-03-01 19:48:02 Alberta has refineries that can meet the needs of BC without us importing oil from out of country?
2149 2018-03-01 19:48:00 [TV] Salvage Hunters (Quest Red) Thu, Mar 8, 6:00 PM Drew picks up a wild-looking Victorian oil lamp and a stunning old American sign in L..

2151 2018-03-01 19:47:49 But we need to get off the oil teet to make that happen
2152 2018-03-01 19:47:49 This is the rain cloud the MSM/ Democrats/liberals have been hoping for. We must realize Obama has sold us out on uranium, oil, coal, and now these 2 vital assets & if Hilary would have been elected God only knows where we would be. Stand strong America.
2153 2018-03-01 19:46:53 Current drink of choice: Spanish olive oil.
2154 2018-03-01 19:46:50 Do you think increasing US #energy exports will impact #oil and gas M&A? #MnA
2155 2018-03-01 19:46:45 One of the many city fans that knows nothing other than the oil money era and thinks their status is based on gradual, earned success. The footballing equivalent of an athlete taking performance enhancing drugs.
2156 2018-03-01 19:46:40 City playing in front of a half empty stadium AWAY from home. Some kind of oil based Premier League conspiracy afoot
2157 2018-03-01 19:46:26 Reason 5: it's nicer for frying savoury things compared to sweet coconut oil.
2158 2018-03-01 19:46:24 Sautéed with garlic, lemon juice and chilies is good. You can serve it on pizza, mix it into pasta sauce (tomato or just a light olive oil sauce, again sigh garlic and chilies)
2159 2018-03-01 19:46:19 Then there's the even stricter "Whole 3": you're only allowed sausages, kale, and coconut oil.
2160 2018-03-01 19:46:16 How about a barter- some rose oil soap in exchange of the rest of the Book right now?
2161 2018-03-01 19:46:16 “Data is the new oil.” Crude oil is like crude data. It needs to be refined before its useable. Christopher Penn #smmw2018 Great analogy.
2162 2018-03-01 19:46:05 I know how he feels. I got given some bergamot and olive oil shower gel. Cycled to work smelling like a cup of Earl Grey tea.
2163 2018-03-01 19:46:05 As soon as I see coconut oil in someone’s skin care routine I immediately stop being interested. That shit clogs your pores 110%
2164 2018-03-01 19:46:02 Because of fracking and large reservoirs of shale oil in the US. Also, OPEC has cut product for quite a few years.

2170 2018-03-01 19:45:28 CN acknowledged yesterday at #2018CFA that they aren’t moving oil or other commodities. #AGRi doesn’t think stopping movement of other commodities is beneficial to the Canadian economy either.

2177 2018-03-01 19:44:52 places jalapeño oil should never be:

- lips

places jalapeño oil currently is:

- lips
- very tip of tongue
- nostril

in conclusion: I am a fool
2178 2018-03-01 19:44:37 It's just so funny how you go in for an oil change and then you go to get an update on things and it's like your whole car is falling apart 
2179 2018-03-01 19:44:23 A huge, obnoxiously loud nightmare of a carousel, led by a wicked baffoon & his clowns, rolled into town slapping his snakeskin oil bottles with his small hands...evil-power hungry grin on his jokers face..and you believed him. Now look at us.
2180 2018-03-01 19:44:22 Hard same. I like to thin slice them on a mandolin and bake them (almost like chips) with a drizzle of olive oil and some good spices.
2181 2018-03-01 19:44:17 $20 tariff per barrel of Canadian oil. And $50 per gallon on Canadian water. Done.
2182 2018-03-01 19:44:05 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

2187 2018-03-01 19:43:41 I just wanna thank @RuPaul and @michellevisage for informing me that I can put fine perfume in my oil diffuser. My entire house smells like Gucci Bamboo now and it is SO. GOOD.
2188 2018-03-01 19:43:40 That could mean it's a dry oil, which wouldn't be surprising. Slap some olive oil on there, it's an occlusive oil which should add moisture and enclose what's left of the argan oil :3
2189 2018-03-01 19:43:30 Where's our PM in all of this? Why is Trudeau spending his time in India taking photoshoots when the Canadian economy is in real trouble. There are entire industries that can be wiped out if this goes through (oil/asbestos/steel)

2200 2018-03-01 19:41:25 @Skyline_Chili what kind of oil are your fries cooked in?
2201 2018-03-01 19:41:18 There is also oil prospecting, a la Jed Clampett
2202 2018-03-01 19:41:02 I’m practically dead for 7 hours a night  I actually wouldn’t mind a nice dream. I’ve got this oil blend called sweet dreams & I put it in my diffuser in hopes that I’ll have one 
2203 2018-03-01 19:41:00 Wasn't there a discovery in the past few days of a large oil deposit in Israel?  Have you heard of this yet?
2204 2018-03-01 19:40:55 Ted your arguing that scots should stick with people who have near bankrupted an oil rich UK,,,and its not cos they spent it on the country is it
Scots can do better than corruption and mis management Ted,,,we can do much better Ted,,let it sink in Ted,,"Bankrupt",,",oil rich UK"

2206 2018-03-01 19:40:44 I've been begging 24/7 online for a few years now.  PLEASE CANNABIS OIL STOPS THE MADNESS FROM AUTISM.  WHY AREN'T PEOPLE IN THE STREETS PROTESTING OVER THIS.  NOTHING ELSE WORKS FOR NERVE PAIN OR PTSD EITHER.  IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING HIGH FOR THE DISABLED.
2207 2018-03-01 19:40:44 It’s Mac n cheese with truffle oil!! Delicious  as their menu was Moroccan & international too
2208 2018-03-01 19:40:42 It is unhealthy if you have too much. End of story. You’re not gonna say something as refined as oil is healthy for you to consume when vegans don’t consume animal products but still have heart disease bc of oil.
2209 2018-03-01 19:40:39 First my heating oil ran out the other day, tonight the wind has broken my front door, so lots of gusts and cold coming into the house and now the milk for the tea has run out! BUT, at least I have bread #TheBeastFromTheEast #SNOWMAGGEDDON
2210 2018-03-01 19:40:38 Didn’t they go from an agrarian economy to an oil based one? They would have food now if there wasn’t that change.
2211 2018-03-01 19:40:35 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
2212 2018-03-01 19:40:34 ARGAN OIL! Is good for skin, and since it's good for hair I'd guess it's good for nails and cuticles as well :3

2216 2018-03-01 19:40:06 US Oil Exports & Tariff’s don’t mix
2217 2018-03-01 19:40:01 Wait, aren’t oil and coal ancient carbons, too?
2218 2018-03-01 19:40:00 If Chump knew, he would no doubt allow oil/natural gas drilling rigs to operate in their feeding grounds.
2219 2018-03-01 19:39:53 I just got told I was going to be charged $380 to change the transmission oil and filter on our ATS. I’m having the same kind of day as the dog. Thanks for this GIF. It put me in a better mood.I’m sending this to my grandkids.
2220 2018-03-01 19:39:44 I love the place where I get my oil changed. I walk in and am offered tacos for lunch. @meinekecarcare
2221 2018-03-01 19:39:40 My Mom! She made moderate investments with oil, gas and coal royalties for a comfortable life. She still plays 27 holes of golf on a tournament day at 84 
2222 2018-03-01 19:39:19 Germany,Japan,South Korea have workforce skilled at robotics,automation and AI. China is quickly catching up with them.
the USA has the US dollar and can print it, Russia  is  oil and natural gas.
2223 2018-03-01 19:39:17 Rizwan Sir ji the petrol wealth is all because of the British Companies who discovered the Oil in the Middle East after 1920s 
So it's really not a contribution because they have not found it on their own
2224 2018-03-01 19:38:52 like I said what works for me won't necessarily work for you. Been using coconut oil for a whileeee now. 
2225 2018-03-01 19:38:46 Maybe if WM kept the economy going back in the 70`s/80`s like Norway did,instead of sitting back letting the markets get on with it and lighting a fat cigar with the feet on the table,maybe they could have avoided near bankruptcy in a fucking oil rich country Ted 
2226 2018-03-01 19:38:35 Oh how cool :D u like stats, right? here's one for ya: '55% of man city fans started  following the club since 2010, when an oil daddy bought it for $5.35 usd. It's been proven that most of city's current fan base were arsenal, Tottenham or Chelsea fans or even salty scousers'
2227 2018-03-01 19:38:21 Dammit, I thought Standard Oil already saved all the whales!

2229 2018-03-01 19:38:14 I have come home tonight to work. But it's super cold and we need an oil delivery. Hmm. Need someone to cuddle for heat.
So if anyone wants a personal warmer, give me a shout... 
2230 2018-03-01 19:38:03 I have olive oil, Argan oil, honey, Greek yoghurt
2231 2018-03-01 19:37:58 Total in situ (non-mining) oil sands production exceeded 1.4 million b/d in Q4 2017 reporting.  22 different projects contributing and that is a full one million barrels higher than production levels 2009.
2232 2018-03-01 19:37:50 Athy... hes out of oil so burning logs  x
2233 2018-03-01 19:37:47 Cee c is tired of rubbing ororo (Groundnut oil) on her body #Bbnaija. Loving this drama
2234 2018-03-01 19:37:32 Dad fiance just gave me a full body massage with menthol massage oil - he better keep this one purely for my backs sake
2235 2018-03-01 19:37:21 What of our own Truce and seize fire? When will it be brokered ???
2236 2018-03-01 19:37:20 "In the event of oil spill..." actually means "when the multiple oil spills occur". Speaking in @EcologyWA language you have to use euphemisms, and engage in wishful thinking. Poorly run department, which knows little about the lands they manage. Pathetic. @WAStateGov
2237 2018-03-01 19:37:06 Do your own oil changes and simple maintenance man, shops will always try to finesse you
2238 2018-03-01 19:36:39 You might find the Rice #oghpc event useful to share this tech with oil companies too
2239 2018-03-01 19:36:31 Hmmm, if only we were moving oil using some a method of transportation that freed up rail lines and resources...
2240 2018-03-01 19:36:24 Do you have any kind of cooking oil, like olive or coconut? You can use that in a pinch.
2241 2018-03-01 19:36:23 WHY IS BEING AN ADULT IS SO HARD?! ALL OF MY MONEY GOES TO BILLS. WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY 95 DOLLARS TO GET MY OIL CHANGED? WHY ARE MY WISDOM TEETH COMING IN?!! WHY WHY WHY ¿¿??!!!?
2242 2018-03-01 19:36:18 U know my Africa has all the natural resources, the world needs, oil, diomonds, gold.....above all we the blessed generation.
2243 2018-03-01 19:36:12 How about Standard Oil and Ma Bell, too.

Oh.  Wait.

2245 2018-03-01 19:35:51 Topical applications with infused coconut oil eases rashes & aching muscles due to receptors on cells. People already make effective bath bombs with distillate.
2246 2018-03-01 19:35:46 I told my smoke shop guy I had a headache and he let me rub CBD oil on my skin because its suppose to help. Bless that man Jim 
2247 2018-03-01 19:35:45 I didn't even realise that was a thing that could happen to olive oil. It's a strange consistency now.
2248 2018-03-01 19:35:32 Ok Ted if you factor in the major upside of NOT having Westminster take over 90% of scots oil and gas revenue,then that more or less cancels your argument that "we should stay for £1700 with people who take our billions" seems a bit mad
2249 2018-03-01 19:35:26 Thanks. We love to support local suppliers & producers. Can’t imagine not being able to chat to customers about the provenance of our food.
2250 2018-03-01 19:35:24 This is why oil appears as supplying 50% of the final energy consumption although it only delivers about 15-20% of the usable «net» or secondary Energy consumption. Oil is not more important in the economy only because its conversion losses appear late in the value chain.....
2251 2018-03-01 19:35:18 Lol yes the oil doesn't match up.
2252 2018-03-01 19:34:46 Myself and @lotusunbeam did motor Vehicle technology at college back in the day and even then tyre tech was a real thing . That and Oil ..
2253 2018-03-01 19:34:31 I don’t know why I’m spending like I have so much money. I bought an essential oil set. A diffuser. A shutter remote for my camera for my new insta. Just spent $60 at Walmart yesterday. Like...my paycheck sucked what am I doooiiinngg???

2258 2018-03-01 19:33:44 Time to sell your oil .

2260 2018-03-01 19:33:31 as with all things, 'follow the money'... oil sands expansion talk has died off because prices have started their long fade due to cheaper supplies... 

and wait until demand drops.... gonna be ugly...
2261 2018-03-01 19:33:30 Yep and right in time greedy oil companies have increased gas prices as they have all winter with snow warnings and holidays!
2262 2018-03-01 19:33:20 You're blindly swallowing snake oil that wont help at all from professional liars. Sorry it hurts your feelings to see those bad arguments picked apart
2263 2018-03-01 19:33:12 If there was a God with a plan, Pruitt would not be head of the EPA. He would be buried under an oil spill somewhere.
2264 2018-03-01 19:33:05 @thepioneerwoman As far as your Walmart cast iron line is concerned, what exactly is Pre-seasoned Plus™? What makes it dishwasher safe? Obv it's more than an oil seasoning to the pan if it's DW safe...
2265 2018-03-01 19:32:55 Never believed all they hype about coconut oil until I started using it as lotion every day. My skin is glowing! 10/10 would recommend highly 
2266 2018-03-01 19:32:53 I don't. All I know is that there is bad palm oil which is mostly found in the North. And there is good one

2268 2018-03-01 19:32:48 Getting an oil change feels suck such an adult thing to do when doing it
2269 2018-03-01 19:32:34 Tax, the immigration ban, deregulation, the Obama mandate abolished, NATO paying more, the wall can be built (judge said), the pipe (oil production), stock market, unemployment, GDP, still president, just off the top of my head.
2270 2018-03-01 19:32:19 Gettin my oil changed
2271 2018-03-01 19:32:10 Christ is not a name, it's a TITLE (meaning anointed, meaning baptized with magical oil), but even #Christian's do not know this about their mythological euhemerised #Jesus deity.
2272 2018-03-01 19:32:09 I have no idea who they are.  . Su wayene?
2273 2018-03-01 19:32:07 Methane is highly combustible and aircraft engines work on combustion - so ... Even oil/gas fuel leaks can cause probs for aircraft, eg in California relatively recently.
2274 2018-03-01 19:31:52 For sure... imo remember to follow the $$-which is why Tillerson was placed in office- that 1/2 trillion + oil deal still needs to happen... they're ALL in it for the /hence -0- enforcement of sanctions....
2275 2018-03-01 19:31:48 You've been licking the babe oil of your elbows again haven't you? 
2276 2018-03-01 19:31:47 I really don’t understand why the people that control the oil/coal industry just switch over to renewable solar,wind,&water energy. Like you’ll still be the rich and have control. What do you have to lose?
2277 2018-03-01 19:31:45 It's all funny and games till somebody loses a eye!
2278 2018-03-01 19:31:00 I'm trying to figure out how to get some oil by tomorrow. A friend has some dc702, but I really want 704. Both are better than hydrocarbons though
2279 2018-03-01 19:30:53 Been snowing since 11am, still no oil delivery, can’t see me getting any tomorrow unless we have a massive thaw. Getting really worried now.

2281 2018-03-01 19:30:47 Wow, interesting they are cheaper. Yes, agreed on the ability to actually heat a room to work in. Thinking back to my bedsit when I was in Liverpool, huge room, high ceilings, one small, 2 bar electric fire - it was damn cold too. Don't think they had oil filled heaters back then
2282 2018-03-01 19:30:40 very nice oil vs xop today
and xau vs gdx 
interesting crb components vs unimpressive $
sticking to midterm bets looks reasonable as things reshuffle and poison minds in this period of time
2283 2018-03-01 19:30:32 The Auto industry plays a key role in American economy, without it there would be no need for work such as mechanics, detailers, body shops, paint jobs, tire shops, express service/oil change business, glass repair, audio system business, insurance companies, as well as towing.
2284 2018-03-01 19:30:25 Go sell your snake oil somewhere else, we’re not buying.
2285 2018-03-01 19:30:09 OIL DIFF: 2.98 -> 3.05
2286 2018-03-01 19:30:05 @waitrose Hello! I recently tried your New York Cheesecake (raspberry and passion fruit). It was delicious  I am very happy that it doesn’t contain palm oil as it is very hard to find yummy things - especially baked goods - that don’t have palm oil in them. 
2287 2018-03-01 19:30:01 Prime my body hemp oil, so actually it’s not the exact same as cbd but very similar

2289 2018-03-01 19:29:55 Isn t 84 gallon about as big as a koy pond. A bathtub holds what 25 gals. So 3 bathtubs of oil. Kinda silly
2290 2018-03-01 19:29:55 Well that is a big part of the problem right the Oil felt they needed to sign the big free agents. Because they have sucked for so long at drafting and developing. It may be putting it kindly to say trading has been up and down too.
2291 2018-03-01 19:29:55 This is a correct information. Well done to the concerned IOCs for the great job on this issue.
2292 2018-03-01 19:29:43 What's his favorite line of discussion?
2293 2018-03-01 19:29:35 The "don't use oil" tripe is a very tired old adage. I can use it just fine without any of it going anywhere near our coastline. Find another talking point. That one's just idiotic.
2294 2018-03-01 19:29:21 wait each tribe has different palm oil?
2295 2018-03-01 19:29:07 Das fah sure. Now es da time to tighten up dem bootstraps or put oil en dem lamps metaphorically speaking of course.
2296 2018-03-01 19:28:56 Going back to olive oil
2297 2018-03-01 19:28:50 Oh.. so sad... to bad
We got coal oil. No need for solar except to light my driveway lights. Works good for that.
2298 2018-03-01 19:28:49 Making coconut oil shooters for opening day, who wants one?
2299 2018-03-01 19:28:37 I’m really pleased with the result...it’s looking like new now the oil has absorbed and dried!  xx
2300 2018-03-01 19:28:32 I adulted so hard today that I got my oil changed within 30 minutes of the check engine light going on. Now I'm baking a chocolate cake for dessert, so my inner child knows I haven't completely lost touch.
2301 2018-03-01 19:28:31 If Trump was smart it would be all fracking-systems GO.  Drop the oil price below $40/barrel let the Russian petrol-state collapse under its own weight.
2302 2018-03-01 19:28:30 It’s so much harder than I thought but the Think Dirty app has been so much help. I’m about to become a crazy oil lady for like all of my cleaning solutions 
2303 2018-03-01 19:28:28 Which one is Yoruba palm oil again ni
2304 2018-03-01 19:28:24 I actually do need more oil etc
2305 2018-03-01 19:28:15 みくりちゃんまだ起きてるんか
2306 2018-03-01 19:28:11 I think I’m about to stop using coconut oil in my hair.
2307 2018-03-01 19:28:04 Let me get my hands on some rose hip oil it’s gonna be over for you bitches
2308 2018-03-01 19:28:04 Great point. Environmental Nazi's not only destroyed mining communities but have made us dependent on unreliable foreign gas and oil and whether the wind is blowing or Sun shining.
2309 2018-03-01 19:28:04 Trudeau claims to help the Canadian economy but all i've seen from him is redundant regulation on vital industries. I'm talking steel, asbestos, oil - regular joe depends on these for their livelihood
2310 2018-03-01 19:28:00 House is nice and warm even though oil company has left me without since Tuesday, cat is really confused and wants to be outside but also want to not be in the snow
2311 2018-03-01 19:27:57 kiehl’s oil eliminating moisturizer my dude
2312 2018-03-01 19:27:23 There's  a lack of females in the oil tanker industry mind
2313 2018-03-01 19:27:13 Coconut oil as a makeup remover is the nastiest thing... Why do people swear by it 
2314 2018-03-01 19:27:12 Didn't know it would be this hard to get an oil change on a Thursday....

Tuh.
2315 2018-03-01 19:27:04 Tomi is just another example of a snake oil salesmen in right wing media
2316 2018-03-01 19:27:00 "Discovery of oil in any nation is usually full of excitement. After all the euphoria, it is however important to begin to examine what can be done in-country to utilize the oil rather looking up the price forecasts in the commodities futures market - @wabote_simbi
2317 2018-03-01 19:26:09 Can’t beat a coconut oil  bath during the weather months to help dry skin. Although I’m sure my hubby would beg to differ when he goes slip sliding around the bath when he has a shower after I’ve had one  @lighty89 this is your warning #coconutoil #winterbath
2318 2018-03-01 19:26:07 I've been looking for all these skin care products but I go right back to just using coconut oil & it leaves my skin clear & soft every trip
2319 2018-03-01 19:25:58 So they can keep those oil industry carbon emissions going on the road to human extinction
2320 2018-03-01 19:25:13 If you're about environment and all that kind of stuff we went since they found out about it a long- time ago President should know I think that I know Bush didn't want to come out to everybody because he would have lost all the taxes on the oil and the money
2321 2018-03-01 19:25:05 Fuck the coast!  The coast don’t care about the rest of BC or Canada so why should we care. This bullshit is being played out on “what if a spill happens” double hull tankers, tugs and oil booms and when was the last tanker that crashed leaving Burnaby?
2322 2018-03-01 19:25:03 Oil and state backed clubs was the end of the beautiful game. VAR is there for TV firms to cram in extra ads. Money's killing the game.
2323 2018-03-01 19:24:44 Go to a Chinese restaurant and get some hot & sour soup with a side of chili oil. Add all the oil you can stand. Eat that and it’ll burn that bitch right out
2324 2018-03-01 19:24:38 Environmental science class starting their oil spill clean up plans on their coastal habitats.
2325 2018-03-01 19:24:31 protip: instead of spending $80 on a candle, take a whiff of your favorite essential oil & then light $80 on fire 
2326 2018-03-01 19:24:26 @SenCarmichaelWV just single-handedly closed school state wide for at least another day. It's time to do what's best for our teachers instead of what's best for oil and gas, Mitch.
2327 2018-03-01 19:24:03 Protect Wildlife from offshore drilling , oil and gas development. Support the Wilderness Society and support Earth Justice - or lose what's already yours!
2328 2018-03-01 19:23:49 Translating it back to English is still extra virgin olive oil. What does it actually say?
2329 2018-03-01 19:23:46 70% of people less or no taxation increase. Block Grant is Scotlands budget , based on its tax take which is returned minus a cut from Westminster. North sea oil a proportional share returned when it should have been all. Then theres reclassifying Scots exports as UK denying tax.
2330 2018-03-01 19:23:36 The second part is water based cleansing which gets rid of whatever the oil cleanser didn't clean etc. They are very gentle and don't leave you skin tight and dry. I use Banilla Co Clean It Zero Purity for my oil cleanser.
2331 2018-03-01 19:23:31 Ugh. Coming up on a oil change
2332 2018-03-01 19:23:30 My coconut oil is solid, quite possibly frozen #veryedinburghproblems #beastfromtheeast
2333 2018-03-01 19:23:26 It's not oil money, it's gaz money in . Saying Psg was a nothing club before Neymar is just a false statement. Psg already won a European Cup, had won 8 french cups, 2 Leagues, semi finalists in both ucl & Uefa Cup and PSG was only born in 1970.
2334 2018-03-01 19:23:23 Alright in that case we can start with cleansing. Double Cleansing is really popular where you first cleanse with an oil based product on dry skin (ex: cleansing balm/ cleansing oil) and it helps get rid of makeup/sunscreen/just oil based impurities.
2335 2018-03-01 19:23:19 Also... have you noticed that gas and oil went WAY, WAY UP this winter?

Here I thought republicans “dropped the cost of fossil fuels” when they have a majority... especially when they have the Presidency.

2341 2018-03-01 19:22:14 UBC is a machine. I am just a simple oil trying to get all the parts to move. And some parts are waking up and humming already. People, thank you. For faith and hope and hunger to see better stuff on your TV screen. We are ready to do this.
2342 2018-03-01 19:22:07 I haven’t tried this but I need to. I mostly don’t miss is but there are a few things that sautéing in onion or garlic oil might work.
2343 2018-03-01 19:22:01 an oil spill happened nearby and the checker at walmart said "probably a foreigner" and when i was walking away she said "thats right im a trump supporter."
2344 2018-03-01 19:21:58 You know this is an utter, absolute lie. Why don't you just be honest about what we're doing there? OIL. This BS is going to down in history with Saddam's WMDs, Gaddafi's Viagra troops, and the Kuwaiti babies on the floor. The American people are sick of the lies & propaganda!

2350 2018-03-01 19:21:24 @AlbertaatNoon Mr Mandel is factually challenged when it comes to pipelines. Any oil going east wouldn't stay in Canada. It would go to Europe. Eastern provinces would still rely on Saudi oil. P.E.T. wanted a National energy program Lougheed was to greedy.

2356 2018-03-01 19:20:37 Ah. Goes to show I know nothing about oil refineries! Ha!
2357 2018-03-01 19:20:36 Basically the PC Opposition thinks because we're reducing carbon emissions by closing one thermal bunker c oil power plant it should let us off the hook for the almost 90% of provincial GHGs from other sources, and the provincial Libs are partially in agreement with them. Sigh.

2364 2018-03-01 19:19:33 Also a tip: usually when you have dry/oily skin it’s because your skin is drying out so your body produces extra oil in order to compensate. Try moisturizing twice a day. I use a tea tree face lotion that mosturizes but also drys matte so you don’t feel greasy :)
2365 2018-03-01 19:19:13 Oh ok. I do use coconut oil! But just bought some avocado oil because my keto cookbook said to. Can't wait to start trying keto recipes

2370 2018-03-01 19:18:36 as a minimum, said tariffs certainly assist Fed in achieving inflation target - if not exacerbate it. hard to think of subject materials (aluminum/steal) more widely used in economy - maybe only with the exception of oil/refined petroleum products

2388 2018-03-01 19:16:04 I don’t think it is a good idea to tariff anything coming into our country, how is that good for us Americans. We should have a substantial export tax for our Oil Natural Gas, Coal, etc. leaving our shores then use the income to rebuild America.  Remember your for us.
2389 2018-03-01 19:15:53 Maybe the oil know something we don't about oel cuz I mean the media are really blasting how hard edmonton will go after him this summer. Nothing about Erik karlsson. Karlsson demanding 10+ is probably why oil will steer clear of him.
2390 2018-03-01 19:15:34 I called retired neighbours to ask how they were getting on with the snow & cold. Their boiler (oil heating) had packed it in. Went round with my husband & an electric heater to check on them

2442 2018-03-01 19:10:32 A 25% tariff on steel could decimate American energy independence. Steel pipe is one of the largest costs to drill and complete an oil well. Most shale plays are marginally economic at $60 per barrel. Increasing the cost of steel will make many wells uneconomic to drill.

2473 2018-03-01 19:05:59 So... good idea, yes. HOWEVER, one would have to use nanoparticle CBD to actually penetrate the CBD thru the skin through spa water. Additionally, using cannabis oil, given resinous compounds, would likely gum up the works of the spa, or the oil would need be free of cannabinoids
2474 2018-03-01 19:05:59 EXACTLY! When will our PM start looking out for Canadian jobs and their interests. Have you seen whats going on in the industries that will be hit most by agreements like this? (asbestos, steel, oil)
2475 2018-03-01 19:05:57 Yesterday, a @Chevron board member tweeted this:

"If #oil energy consumption is declining and #renewableenergy consumption is on the #rise, what does that mean for the future of the oil industry?"

Hours later, they made her delete it. To Big Oil, the truth is terrifying.

Question! Are these sprays safe/practical for use on both fabric and skin/body? I typically buy scented oil sprays for use on pillows / perfume / jackets depending on what I think of the fragrance, but I'm hecka interested in supporting.

Bc won’t let us sell it cause there maybe could possibly someday be a leak that the operator would cleanup...and eastern Canada would rather buy from countries that won’t let women drive and don’t impose these wonderful carbon taxes..irony jt!

Go to hell. Education of the next generation is a start (we tried that in the 70s and it was not very effective)
2488 2018-03-01 19:04:28 I need to lay down and stretch my legs while someone rubs oil on my skin and someone else feeds me ice cream

I hit nothing, but dang that was a close call. #GodIsWithMe

2501 2018-03-01 19:02:37 I understand that squeaky wheels get oil. I don't fuck with that concept personally though. I'd just rather not travel at all than play the game that requires I have to hassle another.

2521 2018-03-01 18:59:50 Wat about the Petro Dollar ?  The Middle East is a colony of the US with control over major oil production.  It's backed by geopolitical power, is it not ?

2523 2018-03-01 18:59:21 Your hostility to Cuba is one of many reasons you are an international laughing stock. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. They are not prepared to be your slave, so you are destroying them. Again, outside the US everybody knows this.

2575 2018-03-01 18:53:34 Actually Petroleum(crude oil) is the parent product of all other fuels. This might be the cause.
 from another point of view, fuel pump, diesel fuel pump, gas pump, gasoline pump, petrol pump, these are all the names used by people of different countries

2578 2018-03-01 18:53:25 Here's a scenario: shale oil continues booming => #crudeoil prices collapse back to the 40s => inflation tanks => low rates for longer => equities continue booming & bond prices explode higher (potential for a masive reversal on bonds). #stocks #markets

2594 2018-03-01 18:51:18 Promises before the price of oil tanked and it was clear that job security and investment was the wise choice.  We can have deficits or mass unemployment and lack of R&D.  Leaders change with the world situation.

2602 2018-03-01 18:50:17 Why yes, we should be absolutely panicking over a trend that's been going on since oil prices tanked in 2014 ... and was already happening when the US opened up the Permian Basin to massive development.

 انا من الناس اللي كنا ونحن صغار يشيلنا والدي في السياره ويطلعنا على سوريا قبل 20سنه وكنت اشوف الكلام القذر والاستهزاء من بعض السوريين على الذات الإلهية والدين الحنيف فكانت النتيجة!؟ ماتراه الان

2612 2018-03-01 18:48:57 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell access to ebooks as a manual.
2613 2018-03-01 18:48:48 Yes nah but beard oil
2614 2018-03-01 18:48:46 Oh OK so if they oil is produced overseas with no respect for the enviro & human rights but we burn it here it’s OK. Totally makes sense...
2615 2018-03-01 18:48:45  change the oil fix the engine or something haha
2616 2018-03-01 18:48:25 Armament to ensure peace is the same as extinguishing fire with oil.
Fucking stupid!
2617 2018-03-01 18:48:24 Aiden. I’m not really that interested in answering your questions I’m just bored. 
We import the oil we need into BC. We don’t need or use the oil that Alberta wants to export. BC needs to import, we don’t need to export.
2618 2018-03-01 18:48:23 Just saw Divas of Karachi . What a shit show - elites making a fool of themselves.
2619 2018-03-01 18:48:19 That is indeed a good question, Adamu Garba looks promising though
2620 2018-03-01 18:48:10 1) Cannabis > Alcohol 
2) Alcohol is the real gateway drug
3) Cannabis and CBD oil naturally heals the body
4) Alcohol breaks the body down
2621 2018-03-01 18:48:08 You guys need to start worrying about NAFTA they impose tariffs on oil like they just did with steel we’re all screwed.
2622 2018-03-01 18:48:03 Energy of the past? You use anything made of plastic very often? How about all those flights to and from DC? Is wind or solar keeping your home warm? Maybe save this tweet for later when there's a legitimate replacement for gas/oil and their byproducts
2623 2018-03-01 18:47:56 Venezuela already did it.  Linked itto their oil industry to dig the socialist govt out of its own grave.
2624 2018-03-01 18:47:52 Who’s got a career in oil and gas law?
2625 2018-03-01 18:47:50 Companies should have a degree of ethical responsibility to deny certain custom orders. This is about an 8 on the scale of finding a strand of hair in your mcdouble to the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico
2626 2018-03-01 18:47:44 I’m on board with blatant self promotion when it’s as useful as this! Thanks for highlighting the paper - I’ll give it a proper read soon, but your comment about silicone oil being inappropriate is interesting. Were the other mounting media all solid-set?
2627 2018-03-01 18:47:42 once he done I’m going to pay my car note, then getting an oil change!!
2628 2018-03-01 18:47:31 Jason, rejoice! Now more than ever AB should be less dependent on the oil economy.  It's not like it used to be.
2629 2018-03-01 18:47:30 That grease as you call it is a mixture of virgin olive oil and water. I have probably been cooking before you were born.
2630 2018-03-01 18:47:23 My butcher obvs heard you. No kidneys to be had. Just beef and olive oil pastry. Pie too big. No dog complained.
2631 2018-03-01 18:47:22 Every time I think about my oil I smile. Mary makes me happy. She’ll never deceive ya
2632 2018-03-01 18:47:17 Am I the only one on twitter that loves to look at pictures of oil refineries? #Refinery #Oil
2633 2018-03-01 18:46:59 Wlh it's sad
2634 2018-03-01 18:46:52 Agreed; but the move in the TW USD from 115 to 83 from 2002 to 2008 probably didn't hurt the big sustained rise in oil prices, no?  :)
2635 2018-03-01 18:46:50 I have a few few Sud bits - wheel centre hubs and 3-hole dash ‘pod ‘ for oil/volt gauges- all original. Do you need any stuff?
2636 2018-03-01 18:46:43 What do you put it on after? After toner? After serum? Before or after moisturizer? Or if I’m using facial oil do I need the other stuff???
2637 2018-03-01 18:46:38 Isn't it time that onshore oil and gas pests were simply told to sling their hook? These people and their questionable methods have no place in a democratic Britain. Let's get on with a sustainable future.
2638 2018-03-01 18:46:29 I love the oil spray and really mild so no worries about triggering allergies around you.
2639 2018-03-01 18:46:17 I apparently signed up for cannabis oil deliveries... I didn't know there was such a thing... 
2640 2018-03-01 18:46:12 It is oil coming up from the ground
2641 2018-03-01 18:46:04 Use some of that oil delivery you were boasting about earlier to thaw it.
2642 2018-03-01 18:45:47 Better get your oil changed boi
2643 2018-03-01 18:45:42 it would be nice if Canada suddenly started shipping it’s oil and farm produce and steel and gold etc etc etc to countries that don’t treat us like the ugly stepchild.
2644 2018-03-01 18:45:41 arrg...since...
2645 2018-03-01 18:45:23 Eucalyptus oil. You can diffuse it or rub a little on your chest, or under your nose. Or believe it or not the bottom of your feet. It helps w congestion. Also hot hot steamy showers.
2646 2018-03-01 18:45:20 In 1938, The Board of Conciliation and Arbitration decides for the foreign oil companies in Mexico the payment of 26 million pesos to the labor union for a number of irregularities.
2647 2018-03-01 18:45:17 I guess seance any challenge or correction of the media darlings lies and misinformation is considered an attack, Im doomed. 
But hey, I can take nasty pot shots at Dana all day long to work out my frustrations, cause thats healthy speech....or something.
2648 2018-03-01 18:45:15 You know it’s Thursday when your hair looks like it’s been deep fried in oil and regret.
2649 2018-03-01 18:45:02 The "federal overreach" narrative completely shatters against @SecretaryZinke's offshore oil policy. 

How is optional medicare expansion "federal overreach," when mandatory offshore drilling is not?

RT if you think @SecretaryZinke should rescind his order.
2650 2018-03-01 18:44:56 Festivals come once in a year and are meant to be enjoyed to the fullest-Agreed! But this doesnot mean to use any crappy things like eggs or oil colors which can be harmful for skin! Enjoy and play holi the way it is supposed to and meant to! Have a happy and safe holi
2651 2018-03-01 18:44:43 @SecretarySonny the American Farmer is counting on you to support the #RFS by not siding with #Oil companies and @SenTedCruz #RFSWorks
2652 2018-03-01 18:44:43 Wood burning stove & oil fired heating...
2653 2018-03-01 18:44:41 If there was no OIL$$ or natural recourses in Arab nations! Or other non western countries ! U.N couldn't give flying fuck about them all ! Iraq was best worst case point !

2657 2018-03-01 18:43:59 Sweet potatoes and olive oil and a lil pesto!!
2658 2018-03-01 18:43:51 All niggas in the oil field do is eat & cheat on their wife's.

2660 2018-03-01 18:43:34 @mustoclothing any tips on maintaining the leather on my #Munro boots? I’ve been using neatsfoot oil on my other leather shoes, will this effect the gore-tex in any way?

2662 2018-03-01 18:43:06 When I was a kid we had a root cellar instead of a fridge, we had to grind our flour, used oil lamps, and my dad’s idea of dessert was yogurt... it took me till the age of about 10 to realize this was not how most kids grew up :’)

2668 2018-03-01 18:42:28 Opponents of #BayouBridge are now shifting gears and offering their full support to the crude oil pipeline project after learning they were duped by the Russians into thinking the pipeline would harm ecologically sensitive areas of Louisiana. #RussianBear

2670 2018-03-01 18:42:21 Dude, Bradbury lived in Venice CA. In the Canal district, back when you didn't tell people you lived in the Canal district. When it was full of oil wells and stuff that was too much trouble to take to a landfill. So, yeah...

2675 2018-03-01 18:41:32 @LushLtd Your company loses all credibility when you align yourself with pseudoscience, snake oil and outright disinformation by sponsoring screening of What the Health. Do your damn research.
2676 2018-03-01 18:41:31 It’s not a necessity for BC that oil be shipped overseas through our province. It is necessary at this time for fuel to be imported into BC for our personal consumption.

2678 2018-03-01 18:41:21 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2679 2018-03-01 18:41:20 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2687 2018-03-01 18:40:12 Putting that up a couple days ago maybe why Puty talking/showing a boutique display of munitions today, they got 1st hand experience with the AOD in Deir Ezzor, Trying to get oil fields for the company & contractor, should have known better
2688 2018-03-01 18:40:11 I like to sniff empty bottles of eucalyptus essential oil. Is this weird? #LuvEucalyptus #EssentialOils
2689 2018-03-01 18:40:04 Vid shows flares as counter-measures. US went back to clean up the mess we helped create by leaving Iraq prematurely. Neither Iraq/Syria could stop ISIS. US created the mess, and is trying to clean up our mistake. We dont need the oil. US produces more than it needs at home.

2695 2018-03-01 18:39:33 And keep them oiled.
2696 2018-03-01 18:39:30 Why would we stop imports of fuel etc that we need to fuel our cars? That question makes no sense. We just don’t want dirty oil to flow from Alberta through BC to be sent offshore.

2698 2018-03-01 18:39:03 My swollen face is FINALLY going down  it’s still red and dry af and not even vitamin E oil is helping that much 
2699 2018-03-01 18:39:02 Ate at @TomDouglasCo Carlile Room last night for first time in a long time. Forgot why I stopped. Sitting here this morning with increasing respiratory issues from nut allergy. I told my server but clearly something had nuts or was cooked in peanut oil they use. Why peanut oil?
2700 2018-03-01 18:38:57 Ditto.
2701 2018-03-01 18:38:55 The Russian government is not just a terrorist one. It is the real criminal mafia which is engaged in raiding, drug trafficking.
How can you deal with a criminal like that? His every word is a lie!
Not how ISIL is not fighting it.They need oil wells.
2702 2018-03-01 18:38:53 @citizentvkenya @AnneKiguta If GOK can pipe oil from mombasa to kisumu why not water from masinga or any other dam to drought prone areas ??? #OpinionCourt

2704 2018-03-01 18:38:18 Umm I am yoga fanatic but I’d say magnesium oil & vitamin B pills to avoid muscle cramps, hydrate ofc & I’d meditate to destress regardless of the event
2705 2018-03-01 18:38:17 Blame it on The Koch brothers not getting half price oil Kenney.

2709 2018-03-01 18:37:53 Coconut Oil Harlen, it's much better, it happened already so there
2710 2018-03-01 18:37:44 Lately I've stopped wearing perfume as it bothers my allergies. I find a  moisturizer works better and is more subtle. Im obsessed with Vaseline cocoa radiant spray oil. Nett always says I smell amazing.

2713 2018-03-01 18:37:08 the worst is coconut oil
2714 2018-03-01 18:37:03 You have to think 1) Is Russia so much further ahead than we are technologically? 2) How are they financing all of this technology, oil or natural resources? Our country can't afford the race how can they?

2717 2018-03-01 18:36:54 The people of America would never agree nor vote to have war on Yemen if they knew the real cause is personal dislike of Yemen by a security force member who didnʻt get a wanted oil field of Yemen. Demand debt repayment to Yemen fully and immediately. Share this everywhere.

2721 2018-03-01 18:36:25 Trump's huge tax breaks for companies then why are there products going higher in cost to the people. Home heating oil alone has doubled in price since last year. So has many other things at the food store. What good is this tax break if U can't afford to buy what you need.
2722 2018-03-01 18:36:10 my dad made fun of me last night so i put strawberry jelly on the bottom of the TV remote, and coconut oil on every handle he’ll touch when he gets home :’) 

we also currently have no dish/hand soap either so he can’t wash his hands right away :)))

2738 2018-03-01 18:34:51 @costcocanada I saw your new Nut Bars in your magazine.  They look amazing and affordable.  Do they contain seed oils or Canola oil?
2739 2018-03-01 18:34:42 Big oil is a similar offender.
2740 2018-03-01 18:34:20 America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria.Apr 12, 2012

2743 2018-03-01 18:34:00 Most of you didn't read the article obviously. Concerns about NAFTA and falling oil prices causing the exodus from Alberta are the prime reasons. Neither of which JT can be blamed for. Unless of course you act like a troll or party shill.
2744 2018-03-01 18:33:44 Because the book was about 20% what happened on the Pequod, and 80% whale stuff. Whale oil, whale skeletons, whale art, whales in literature, whale boats, whaling tools, whaler jobs, the whaling industry, which countries are best at whaling
2745 2018-03-01 18:33:30 "It's not what happens to you. It's what you do with what happens to you that counts." Buhari did very poorly with the oil glut that happened to us.

2747 2018-03-01 18:33:26 y con respecto a las naftas y gas oil el tema es que el gas oil lo venden con subsidio y las naftas alcohol y gas es de entrada libre pero el gobierno le cobra a las otras petroleras que venden nafta un porcentaje ! por eso es que venden la nafta mas barata !

2755 2018-03-01 18:32:42 Incorrect, you choose to pay up for Tulipcoins vs. every US citizen pays for the public debt with their taxes in US Dollars beside the global oil trading. Tulipcoins are speculative and they hardly have any utility as a transaction method.

2758 2018-03-01 18:32:21 Winona LaDuke is an American paid environmentalist! Follow the money. They and you Hudema are focused on shutting down Canadian oil and gas access to market. US is the benefactor of 1/2 price oil & gas as a result. They don’t give a shit about the shit in the water!
2759 2018-03-01 18:32:21 There should be a fund paid by gun makers for victims of shootings, just like BP oil damages

I never saw them take the tires off.  I also witnessed half the employees smoking while working on the cars.

2884 2018-03-01 18:14:32 You are not being objective and it's needless continuing this thread... Where's the money to do all you've mentioned when there's oil glut
2885 2018-03-01 18:14:29 Not as such, but the EU might be more inclined to get involved as UK is leaving and this would seriously strengthen their hand in Brexit negotiations. Support Scotland and suddenly they could secure access to the fishing grounds, oil without import duties, etc.
2886 2018-03-01 18:14:14 Calm down mechanic guy, just here for an oil change. If I wanted to know about all the other shit wrong with my car I'd turn the radio down.
2887 2018-03-01 18:14:12 Being a private company does not vindicate one's morally abhorrent actions. You wouldn't defend oil companies spilling oil, google making skynet, or Ford making cars designed to speed up global warming. Companies are made of people and people do wrong.
2888 2018-03-01 18:13:55 Russia and China are still supply N Korea with oil and military supplies.. All 3 are Imperial communist regimes.. Our democracy is still under constant attack.. Russia is now bragging about their superior hypersonic missles systems.. Our defense system can't track them..
2889 2018-03-01 18:13:46 I'm going to buy an oil rig 13 miles out in international waters and call it RandGirlia. It will be a libertarian paradise 
2890 2018-03-01 18:13:34 I thought it sad an oil slick from a leaking tanker just up the coast a bit...
2891 2018-03-01 18:13:25 Coconut oil will have to try,  everything i try doesn't help at all. I hate it
2892 2018-03-01 18:13:19 ....and this from a woman who laughed and gloated when a man was murdered by a bayonet being thrust into his rectum and her words of condemnation were,
"we came, we saw, he died...and then you ised the country's oil...
2893 2018-03-01 18:13:17 It's time to turn off the flow of oil to the US...
2894 2018-03-01 18:13:16 A vaca é fake ! múuuuuuuuuu !!!!!!
2895 2018-03-01 18:13:11 Today is a great day for having a warming Magnesium Oil foot bath. I've had mine.
2896 2018-03-01 18:13:09 Forget the pub test, here's Centrelink.

"You may still be a member of a couple if you're not physically living with your partner. For example, your partner may fly-in-fly-out or live away for work, such as military or oil rig workers."
2897 2018-03-01 18:13:06 You might sleep better at night, yes, I take money from oil companies etc and sacrifice my ethics,...say it out loud now!!!
2898 2018-03-01 18:12:41 Sounds as though they would be.  I'm delighted that developments are going so well and that jobs offshore are on the increase. Particularly impressed by the fact that, despite the many warnings of how costly it would be to extract the oil, ways to cut costs have been introduced.
2899 2018-03-01 18:12:28 Finally!

This is actually a huge win. Exxon's resources are what Putin's oil business needed to explore arctic drilling.
2900 2018-03-01 18:12:24 So while they kill each other, the real devil wants only one thing & it isn't to follow Christ, they want oil.
2901 2018-03-01 18:12:14 Btw, Marjoram essential oil is also an excellent one for relieving sore muscles, rubbed on (never directly put essential oils on skin, as they can cause irritation or an allergic reaction, but rather dilute it with a carrier oil or water) or part of a hot bath.
2902 2018-03-01 18:12:14 A tanker car of oil pays a lot more than a hopper car full of grain . If your a business man which one would you take ?
2903 2018-03-01 18:12:02 effective pala talaga ang castor oil hahahaha
2904 2018-03-01 18:11:54 My favorite pass time is spraying catnip oil for the cat and watching her get stoned 
2905 2018-03-01 18:11:54 Technically speaking, "take their oil" wasn't due process, either...
2906 2018-03-01 18:11:53 I shall answer this unequivocally for you. You are going to burn in a big greasy chip pan of oil on the open flame of Satan's gas cooker.
2907 2018-03-01 18:11:47 It's COCONUT oil @GodrejLocksS #Contest #Puzzles #SafeHoli #BeSafeThisHoli #ThinkSafetyThinkGodrejLocks
2908 2018-03-01 18:11:45 South South is just terribly stupid I fear for the region in the next 20 years. Just imagine crude oil relevance dropping
2909 2018-03-01 18:11:37 put lime brand yuyee oil
2910 2018-03-01 18:11:36 The Lodger sent a very dear worried email saying 'if you haven't already, get the oil filled radiator out + leave it on low by the boiler this weekend because burst pipes' (tho to be fair the lack of burst pipes does also benefit him)
2911 2018-03-01 18:11:31 Went to Tesco. due to vegan diet there was no shortage of food. laughed at everyone and trotted to the counter loaded up with soymilk, soy beef and olive oil. 
2912 2018-03-01 18:11:23 The Mexican man who does my oil change, I’ve never seen him smile before. Always grumpy, like… sir… Catalina ain’t bussing it up for you lately?
2913 2018-03-01 18:11:17 Meanwhile, the rise of protectionism.
Donald Trump slaps tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.
India targets palm oil. The Delhi budget last month signalled a rolling back of trade liberalisation.
Liam Fox has his work cut out if he's going to turn that tide.
2914 2018-03-01 18:11:17 See that's how I know everyBODY is different. Cuz I've been using vitamin E oil since the beginning of time and my skin looks nothing like yours. Go away
2915 2018-03-01 18:11:15 In a budget that so-called experts decried as a “complete giveaway” to Obama, Paul Ryan worked in making $680B in tax breaks for business, permanent. He got the US oil export ban lifted (we will be a top 10 exporter by 2020) and killed off two Obamacare taxes. 

What a fail.
2916 2018-03-01 18:11:09 i thought i would own the libs by eating only hungry man meals but then learned that they contain soybean oil. looks like i was the soyboy all along :(
2917 2018-03-01 18:11:08 And yet you ignore Englands trade deficit. Poo pooing Scotlands positive one. Insisting we have a fictional black hole. PS oil is up has been for 2months.
2918 2018-03-01 18:11:01 Starting my day out with some essential oil‘s makes for a great day!  @doterra
2919 2018-03-01 18:10:59 Specifically watching the $EURO right now. If it breaks back down under 1.2180, oil and $GLD probably both crack. Interesting $TLT trying to break to new highs, which is a bit odd and conflicting. Starting to see a few larger cap names turn red $COP $EOG $OXY $PXD $APC.
2920 2018-03-01 18:10:46 So my grocery list could include Smith and Wesson Oil?
2921 2018-03-01 18:10:42 Maybe in true #Trump EPA fashion, Pruitt should just fly alone in a Concorde powered by whale oil.
2922 2018-03-01 18:10:39 @Dr_K2015 #جامعة_الباحة #بيلوجيات
Secretory structure 
Oil ( peanuts, Orange, citrus) from accumulation of glands
2923 2018-03-01 18:10:34 i need to go get my oil changed and get an alignment but no one wants to go with me 
2924 2018-03-01 18:10:21 仕事に疲れた時は甘い物がいいって言うよな！え…このプリン、ナルルちゃんのだったのか…(｀ω´;;)
2925 2018-03-01 18:10:08 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
2926 2018-03-01 18:10:04 That's because he knows that #MarionHammer would boil him in a pot of hot oil if even considered it.
2927 2018-03-01 18:10:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
2928 2018-03-01 18:09:59 I second the cbd oil. I use the brand FLO. Works for my lower back pains and even period cramps.
2929 2018-03-01 18:09:58 Ferns is the one that protected oil and gas. Good luck, the dude is a spineless windbag
2930 2018-03-01 18:09:55 Congratulations, he was a snake oil salesman who made millions off lying to the masses and premising them hope. Wonder why @realDonaldTrump  has honored him? 
2931 2018-03-01 18:09:53 @SenCarmichaelWV C’mon Mitch. Do what’s right!  These are issues that should’ve been addressed years ago. Get out of the pockets of oil and gas and increase severance tax. #55strong
2932 2018-03-01 18:09:45 Alaskans own 7,551 shares of COSAN SA INDUSTRIA E COMERCIO, worth $92,421. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in BRAZIL.
2933 2018-03-01 18:09:36 Need to go get an oil change
2934 2018-03-01 18:09:35 However, while the #DXY and #Gold remain near perfectly inverse correlated, S&P and Oil have lagged so far. I agree on a ST PB in DXY and bounce in Gold, S&P, and Oil, but I expect the smaller dollar moves to the upside to have a bigger on S&P going lower, perhaps Oil too.
2935 2018-03-01 18:09:28 Chick peas, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper. Blitz in a food processor.
2936 2018-03-01 18:09:24 Habrá que meter fuel oil el sábado
2937 2018-03-01 18:09:19 Enough?  I will drop that egg accidentally, open the cooking oil lid & leave in “a rush” 
2938 2018-03-01 18:09:18 "we came up off that thick ass wic peanut butter with the sweat on it" 
-@KarlousM 

Lmmfao that shit was made of out peanuts, oil, and humility.
2939 2018-03-01 18:09:16 People! During President Obama's time in office everyday you would hear about the price of a barrel of oil cost, pump prices would go up rarely, and down! Under Trump and Nazi Koch brother's?
2940 2018-03-01 18:09:14 Yeah that’s right. I gotta look at home for the name of the oil place we went too. It was so nice.
2941 2018-03-01 18:09:10 Bakersfield is last place in their division.  So what should they do with him then?  If the oil were winning you wouldn’t want to bring him in either, since it affects what the team has going.  So when is a good time?
2942 2018-03-01 18:09:06 Transporting all that oil that should be in pipelines- apparently the environmental elite believe trains are safer.
2943 2018-03-01 18:08:50 veggie oil in the pan, gah damn
2944 2018-03-01 18:08:33 Its really simple. Just buy Havoline/Delo oil and stand a chance to win. #CaltexBebaBeba
2945 2018-03-01 18:08:20 How about having the oil & gas companies pay their FAIR share taxes via their extraction of gas like other states.  If nothing else to set aside those funds to clean up after they quit dumping toxic chemicals back into the ground  & destroying the taxpayers land
2946 2018-03-01 18:08:09 nice try.  Oil is dead man walking. the faster we get rid of it the better..
2947 2018-03-01 18:07:55 "center left & some youth" or what I like to call "oil & water"
2948 2018-03-01 18:07:55 You can "bake" fries in the oven,without oil,they aint juicy but their crispy #Lifecheats
2949 2018-03-01 18:07:50 I know exactly what you mean. Open your window, light a incense stick/sage or burn oil, and do something you enjoy. Read, write, draw, stretch..
2950 2018-03-01 18:07:42 yo this vape cartridge for oil is so clutch and discreet
2951 2018-03-01 18:07:42 Called to get a price about my oil change, once they told me I was like shyt where the bus at!!!
2952 2018-03-01 18:07:41 @SenCarmichaelWV #weneedboth Fully fund PEIA with oil & gas severance taxes and give ALL public employees a raise! #55strong
2953 2018-03-01 18:07:37 Get you some beard oil bru
2954 2018-03-01 18:07:34 So somehow my paints got mixed up and I accidentally used oil paint on something, then went to clean everything off and now my hands, paintbrush, water cup, and sink are stained with maroon paint. So that’s how my day is going.
2955 2018-03-01 18:07:27 It is America and Israel with their allies whom is killing Syrians. They started terrorism and war in Syria. They are stealing soil, souls and oil from Syria, Lebanon and all of Middle East and other countries around the globe. Syrians are killing other Syrians for Israel and US.
2956 2018-03-01 18:07:25 Agree. I didn't have room, but it is packed in water, not oil.
2957 2018-03-01 18:07:21 This year holi will be special as the darling of sardessai family will be celebrating holi with Bamboo instead of Colour and Oil instead of water. @sagarikaghose 
2958 2018-03-01 18:07:08 “Conflict” oil on canvas
2959 2018-03-01 18:07:06 I'm not offended. I do tend to keep up to date with developments in the oil industry every day I go to work. I think the tax breaks that were in turn demanded and then criticised by the nationalist movement have been vital to the industry.
2960 2018-03-01 18:07:05 those who dab the oil from their pizza all have PhDs
2961 2018-03-01 18:07:02 Second, Data is the new oil. Keeping data local is VITAL to many countries, and I agree with you - this trend is going to continue.
2962 2018-03-01 18:06:48 I’ve been mixing vitamin e oil with my lotion and I really thinks it’s been a winter time game changer
2963 2018-03-01 18:06:48 Easy question. I would prefer it in water, not oil. I can always add olive oil to my tuna salad if I want.
2964 2018-03-01 18:06:45 my hairs the same way, it grows so fast and then just stops at my shoulders. try castor oil, wild hair growth oil, or biotin
2965 2018-03-01 18:06:44 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
2966 2018-03-01 18:06:44 Ah yes. Psalm AR15 
Even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil, your AR15 and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in  the presence of my enemies. You anoint my bullet head band with oil,  my cup overflows. 
WTF sheep
2967 2018-03-01 18:06:40 c o m p l a i n 

raise a ruckus

the squeeky wheel gets the oil
2968 2018-03-01 18:06:37 Time To Go Get That 
Oil Change On My Bitch 
2969 2018-03-01 18:06:34 I need some more black soap and some more tea trees oil my skin saying I hate you right about now 
2970 2018-03-01 18:06:27 Rub alcohol on your face let it dry really good then baby oil.
2971 2018-03-01 18:06:15 One step at a time. Next, you change the oil.
2972 2018-03-01 18:05:52 Anyone who delivers emergency olive oil?  
2973 2018-03-01 18:05:47 This is the country with the largest reserves of oil on the planet
2974 2018-03-01 18:05:33 Poll the oil and gas lobby, I think they would disagree with that premise.
2975 2018-03-01 18:05:20 جمهور محسن ناشبين لجمهور فهد ال حركان ترا والله م رفعنا تاق ضد محسن ولا درينا عنه وبعدين ليش نوقف ضده الحمدلله فهد اعلى جماهيريه ماحد ينافسه الله يبارك له في جماهيريته ويزيده قبول

2976 2018-03-01 18:05:18 Snug little country bumpkins here using oil because you won't supply us with gas 
2977 2018-03-01 18:05:07 03.01

Roasted Chicken, Corn, and Kale w a Lemon Dressing

Kale, Grana Cheese, Hazelnuts, and Red Onion w Olive Oil, Salt, and Pepper

Roasted Beets w Curly Kale

Farfalle w Button Mushrooms, Carmelized Onions, and a Balsamic Reduction

Quinoa w Bell Peppers, Carrots, and Chives
2978 2018-03-01 18:04:50 Nice
2979 2018-03-01 18:04:42 It does not help that a lot of rail capacity is moving oil as well. Our rail lines are simply overtaxed. A few years back, I took Via from Winnipeg to Saskatchewan. Spent most of my time on side rails as we made way for freight.
2980 2018-03-01 18:04:36 Essence? Serum? Oil cleanser? Low ph cleanser? Toner?
2981 2018-03-01 18:04:36 But where's the profit for Big Oil ?
2982 2018-03-01 18:04:32 Organic oil though.... G12?
2983 2018-03-01 18:04:23 time for America to pay full market price on oil, their massive discount should end immediately. Then shut off the fresh water supply to the midwest and west coast.
2984 2018-03-01 18:04:19 Nah, CBD oil is the tree of life
2985 2018-03-01 18:04:13 Just left the dealership getting windshield wipers. The oil changing place wipers be wack
2986 2018-03-01 18:03:59 We’re loving #cauliflowerrice in our house right now! I roasted ours with a little oil and chilli flakes, and paired it with #homemade mushroom curry. Super  warming in this chilly weather! Brrr! #vegan #cooking 
2987 2018-03-01 18:03:44 @F3Metro @polarmurph Schnauzer takes the lead at Sparta in the morning. Come for the workout, stay for the beard oil.
2988 2018-03-01 18:03:30 เกี้ยวกราด รือ ออเจ้า
2989 2018-03-01 18:03:08 Don’t ask a female to cook, clean, and wait on you hand and foot if you CANNOT:
-fix a flat tire
-change engine oil
-fix light fixtures 
-fix a tail light
-fix the chain on a bike 
-boil water 
-move furniture around
Some of y’all are really worthless but expect King treatment.
2990 2018-03-01 18:03:03 I don't think Irak people is interested in the partition of their nation. The Kurdish regions  which are very rich in oil are the price which big oil companies are after
2991 2018-03-01 18:02:59 I like oil lamps! There is a high literacy rate in my WIP, so I can send letters around. But since the characters are traveling, they are pretty isolated until they reach a town.
2992 2018-03-01 18:02:57 they a dough

2993 2018-03-01 18:02:48 Walked into kitchen, temperature at 38.9°F quickly put oven on and ran out.  No central heating as such and it is freezing sat here near draughty windows, even sat next to an oil heater.    #SNOWMAGGEDDON #BrassMonkeyWeather
2994 2018-03-01 18:02:48 Hope The Rhombus Firm have managed to sort “A meet” with the City Firm “the Oil Clouts” what With the snow causing Chaos in London, Tommy and co are gonna need proper balance tonight. 
2995 2018-03-01 18:02:45 My day was going swell until I splashed hot oil onto my face
2996 2018-03-01 18:02:43 or 71077345 (shell oil)
2997 2018-03-01 18:02:35 I will pay someone to take my car for an oil change in the morning so I don’t have to wake up.
2998 2018-03-01 18:02:28 It should also be obvious that as the world economy is weaning from oil, only the cheapest sources will survive. Meaning: not Canadian. So exactly why should we tolerate leaky and short term pipelines that will generate very few jobs, instead of investing massively in renewables?
2999 2018-03-01 18:02:13 Oil her whole front up , get her to hug the old boy and shake her up and down I reckons
3000 2018-03-01 18:02:06 Native olive oil is the most expensive but it generally performs better than Hybrid oil
3001 2018-03-01 18:01:47 You're welcome. Those tips are huge...there's an app that tells you how much people in your area paid for the car you want. I believe it's Truecar. 

If there are amenites with the car dealer get free oil changes, tire rotation, loaner car or pick up drop off. Or all three.

3005 2018-03-01 18:01:32 Check peanut butter labels - don't buy any with palm oil.  Email the company & ask them to remove palm oil.  ALL palm oil plantations replace biodiverse tropical forests.
3006 2018-03-01 18:01:29 0101
3007 2018-03-01 18:01:28 Neon glows orange. Putting coconut oil on these pimples has been butchered so bad so that it sets….
3008 2018-03-01 18:01:22 @realDonaldTrump yes middle east country also consider to change the policy to sell their oil and gas in their own country money
3009 2018-03-01 18:01:11 This is the massive misconception of cannabis.  It has so many healing properties. Look into the hemp as well. Hemp seed oil. Hemp Bricks. Hemp Paper. Hemp clothing. Hemp Etc 
3010 2018-03-01 18:00:59 @neighborhoodea1 do you cook with peanut oil? Curious because my son is allergic to nuts. Thanks!
3011 2018-03-01 18:00:55 I'm talking more geopolitical possibilities considering Russia new capabilites with nuclear armament. Steel, aluminum will affect Canada more as Canada has limited exporting partners for goods, much like oil exports we are forced to sell for super cheap to u.s.
3012 2018-03-01 18:00:50 Shit smells like people braking super hard too haha and burnt oil
3013 2018-03-01 18:00:47 Pakai beard oil la
3014 2018-03-01 18:00:41 And a drizzle of a very green oil made with flavourless shit
3015 2018-03-01 18:00:38 We’re running on emergency oil and logs but we’re good! I can’t risk any booze as I’ll be needed in the night cause Issy isn’t sleeping well, it’s not worth the hassle/headache!
3016 2018-03-01 18:00:35 Frozen pipes and little oil.!! Not great.!!
3017 2018-03-01 18:00:33 Truffle oil is Satan's ballsweat.
3018 2018-03-01 18:00:27 You've been taking advantage of other countries for decades fighting your proxy wars for you to steal oil, What do you know about fair? Go rebuild that bombed out crater you used to call Iraq/Afghanistan and just ignore Syria because you scared of Daddy Putin
3019 2018-03-01 18:00:20 OIL DIFF: 2.99 -> 3.04
3020 2018-03-01 18:00:17 In the kitchen and not wearing a top and oil busy spreading in my chest
3021 2018-03-01 17:59:56 Honestly this is kind of pathetic. You could be using these resources to move away from an oil based economy. Instead you are using your limited resources to develop weapons that have one use, and if it ever comes to that we are all screwed anyway. Please be smarter from now on.
3022 2018-03-01 17:59:52 Tell him directly!!! He’ll appreciate it while in recovery
3023 2018-03-01 17:59:46 *marinates my whole life with coconut oil*
There, this is gonna fix everything
3024 2018-03-01 17:59:45 And whale oil for street lamps.
3025 2018-03-01 17:59:41 They look angrier than they did this morning. Did someone prove oil demand would peak in the next five years?
3026 2018-03-01 17:59:31 My roommate is in the kitchen and u gotta steal some of his cooking oil right now 
3027 2018-03-01 17:59:17 She seems like a cool girlfriend. Tell her to come to any location and her next oil change is on me.
3028 2018-03-01 17:59:17 A problem is that AB 398 mandates that the market and only the market  (i.e. Cap-and-Trade) regulates carbon emissions from refineries and oil/gas production facilities in the state. Cap-and-Trade is a legal and  political impediment to cutting oil. That is why Big Oil loves it.
3029 2018-03-01 17:59:16 @AbadaEfeJulius - the fed govt should restrict NNPC n any other crude oil or petroleum jobs n employment to the nigerdelta indigenes only.
3030 2018-03-01 17:59:14 Word.
3031 2018-03-01 17:59:07 no better feeling than putting tanning oil in my online basket all ready for my holss
3032 2018-03-01 17:58:41 It’s due to the shitty recycled oil in the making of it. Outsourced regulate their own shitty policies to make profits, they make more coming back and using that crack filler. $$$
3033 2018-03-01 17:58:35 Reuters- Mexico oficializa que licitara bloques de reservas no convencionales (shale oil and gas) en cuenca de Burgos mediante contratos de licencia a ser adjudicados el 5 de sept
3034 2018-03-01 17:58:23 And switch to what?
Why do you hate conservative men?
3035 2018-03-01 17:58:21 Pretty excited about @EatBobos new recipe; replacing palm oil with organic coconut oil. Part of their reason is that this ingredient switch lessens the environmental impact of deforestation. Pretty awesome! #eatbobos #coconutoil
3036 2018-03-01 17:58:20 There’s going to be one hell of a trade war so we had better get our ducks in a row fast. No cheap oil for the USA for starters...and if it’s Made in USA don’t buy it.
3037 2018-03-01 17:58:09 A quick background look - purchased through Mark Hampton LLC interior designers, owned by Alexa Hampton, married to Pavlos Papageorgiou, CFO of SEACOR Marine Holdings - offshore oil and gas exploration.  Connection?
3038 2018-03-01 17:58:04 I just ordered some jojoba oil to use for oil cleansing and overnight moisturizing, I'm excited. I'm going to make some whipped body butter with this shea butter I got too
3039 2018-03-01 17:58:03 Time to bring the tanning oil back out 
3040 2018-03-01 17:57:55 友達とずっとネルギガンテ周回してた
頭おかしなるで。
3041 2018-03-01 17:57:52 Good! Meanwhile I'm destroying their ownership of our bodies in federal court. My faith is taking back cannabis which is used in the Holy oil of Christ.
3042 2018-03-01 17:57:51 tea tree !! get a cotton swab and put that oil on there and put it on your breakout, it gets dry tho. I recommend the cerave moisturizer w spf
3043 2018-03-01 17:57:49 Only when the oil lorry drivers went on strike.
3044 2018-03-01 17:57:35 allergic to coconut oil?
3045 2018-03-01 17:57:30 Yall don't check to see if ya tires need to be rotated? Oil changed? Smh
3046 2018-03-01 17:57:20 *Italian gesture*
How dare you! I cannot enjoy pasta or pita bread without olive oil! You want me to starve?
3047 2018-03-01 17:57:15 Yes, let's make them ALL into oil
3048 2018-03-01 17:57:13 Can you imagine?, this oil marketers are hypocrites, no body answer them only them Don they sell fuel 145 again, @MBuhari

3050 2018-03-01 17:57:09 @iliketomakestuf Hey!  I would love to see an episode where you give a rundown of stains/finishes and where you use them.  Wax vs oil vs stain (or combinations thereof.  Favorite treatments for certain species of wood, etc.  Thanks!
3051 2018-03-01 17:57:00 I completely believe all these guys were promised a very tiny but lucrative percentage of the big Russian oil deal (once sanctions were lifted).
3052 2018-03-01 17:56:47 Dress up&play business.
Excited by the paper&metals,precious stones&fish&oil&,oh just anything.
Purpose of living right to sell each other what is a stupidity.
I'll gain my half acre of life&be content in the sun ..
3053 2018-03-01 17:56:46 WTI oil at $60.58/barrel, -$1.05.
3054 2018-03-01 17:56:33 Remember the book 'the prize'...there is a section on 1870-1890...and how discipline ultimately was enforced in the US...and it came via Standard Oil consolidating...absent this, it was hard to enforce discipline...fast fwd to today...will it be any different?
3055 2018-03-01 17:56:33 Lmao. Oil and business mogul in the same room. Madddd
3056 2018-03-01 17:56:32 New to me usually salt and olive oil but now mayo is on the list. Thanks for the hint
3057 2018-03-01 17:56:25 Yeah, I can see that. I think it honestly depends on the kit, though. Idkwth my wife bought for her CBD oil but it's nice. And silent. And I'm a bit jealous lol
3058 2018-03-01 17:56:15 Explique melhor a destruição o natural que aconteceu no México com o seu cérebro privilegiado, por favor.
3059 2018-03-01 17:55:56 @WoodGroup ... what are your thoughts on the oil rig platform construction and fabrication industry ... what do this of the shelf life of the North Sea  and the state of Saudi Oil fields ...
3060 2018-03-01 17:55:53 本当に放送時間以外文句がない
3061 2018-03-01 17:55:46 Whenever I go to Whole Foods to re-up my oil cabinet the cashier always asks “is this all for your hair?!” 
No matter their race or gender it never fails lol
3062 2018-03-01 17:55:34 Old oil lamps are pretty cool though!

Yeah, birds, foot/horse messenger and boat are pretty well your only communication options!

In my WIP, you don't find out what happens in the end to many characters because of distance and high illiteracy, there's no way to communicate.
3063 2018-03-01 17:55:31 A beauty question!  I've used for years "authentic nourishing oil" by davines for my hair and while I adore it and highly recommend it, I wanna know the options you have to keep your hair healthy :D
3064 2018-03-01 17:55:16 Imagine your heating oil running out in the middle of this weather, surprise it happened to me
3065 2018-03-01 17:55:15 @naughtyTyi wish that was me rubbing baby oil all over your hot naked body gorgeous!! mmmm love ya lots from Ben
3066 2018-03-01 17:55:07 Too bad you let the oil pipeline get built with foreign steel.
3067 2018-03-01 17:55:06 Lol. I love my Neti pot. Add a single drop of tea tree oil to the salt & BOOM! Sinus infection prevention.
3068 2018-03-01 17:54:54 hehehe or that much of oil sufficient to shine his beard. 
3069 2018-03-01 17:54:53 You also mentioned cakes before - my son has coeliac disease and we use a brilliant book called Red Velvet and Chocolate Heartache by Harry Eastwood. She uses vegetables in place of butter/oil and mainly almonds and rice flour.They're yummy even if you're not avoiding gluten.
3070 2018-03-01 17:54:53 I'm sure Oil&Gas companies may have done their home work & their probes/field work can predict fair volume etc but the question is to corroborate his claims [for public consumption] with the factual scientific data - Pakistani scientists like their mullahs exaggerate a lot 
3071 2018-03-01 17:54:38 “These oil companies began to be seen as partners in Cuba’s progress.” - Dr. Gettig
3072 2018-03-01 17:54:30 Oil price is up. Forecast is good. Don’t think currently Scotland doesn’t .....
3073 2018-03-01 17:54:26 Idiot khan, getting married at 66 and looking for oil, makes sense 
3074 2018-03-01 17:54:05    The problem is that all this renewable technology is made with oil. The other problem is that if people do not know how to save energy, using renewable energy does not help nothing...
3075 2018-03-01 17:54:00 Put a little  oil on yo pans after you clean them it helps keep them from rusting lol it’s just an added tip
3076 2018-03-01 17:53:28 Oil -as we noted a few weeks ago Oil put in its high and was headed down. We suspect Oil counter trend rally is completed and now breaking down and shall fall much lower but we shall see rallies along the way over time we will see a retest of the lows and a break through of lows
3077 2018-03-01 17:53:28 I know some women are against wearing stockings or tights with dresses but you can't be against baby oil, lotion or Shea butter...
3078 2018-03-01 17:53:27 Jesus let Mary massage his feet with oil & her hair! At times He was alone with a woman. Was He unwise? Inviting sin?

Beware of man-made rules that have an appearance of wisdom, but lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence. Col. 2

Watch out for sexist consequences.
3079 2018-03-01 17:53:24 True. And, the gun lobby pales in comparison to the lobby money from pharma, insurance, oil, and telecom. They're all bought by someone.
3080 2018-03-01 17:53:17 I need a oil change ASAP
3081 2018-03-01 17:52:55 Hopefully the government doesn’t drill the oil by the river!!!!
3082 2018-03-01 17:52:51 Genius common sense!
3083 2018-03-01 17:52:46 Do not adjust, clean, or oil moving machinery. #BaffinSafety
3084 2018-03-01 17:52:40 because you're way more familiar with peperoni on cheese than you are clay+iron & plant oil based inks on dolemite surfaces & your brain wants to quickly identify things & transfer them from unidentified to familiar.
3085 2018-03-01 17:52:18 My oil change can wait till tomorrow, I’m going straight home after work
3086 2018-03-01 17:52:15 Crude oil prices are also going to be main determinant of GDP.
3087 2018-03-01 17:52:13 Love it when @npowerhq overestimate, ignore correct readings, threaten court action and are too busy to even talk about the problem. Top service, 10/10 would revert to whale oil ASAP
3088 2018-03-01 17:52:11 This is so true. recently in a meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary he was repeatedly asked by the SC if he had produced even one glass of oil in his entire tenure.
3089 2018-03-01 17:52:03 But have you heard of any school that discriminate other tribes in the north??
3090 2018-03-01 17:52:00 @420BibIe We are taking this plant back for our faith. I filed a federal lawsuit against Idaho for denying CBD oil. It evolved into a demand for the buds for the making of the Holy oil of Christ. It is required of my faith to give the Holy oil to the sick as Jesus commanded.
3091 2018-03-01 17:51:51 Black seed oil... Dandelion coffee.... would be good too!
Keep PH levels high (Alkaline) and vegan diet... God bless!
3092 2018-03-01 17:51:40 metals not energy. hard commodities. Oil is another animal.
3093 2018-03-01 17:51:35 Oh you're right, I'll try baby oil!
Thank you!!!!!
3094 2018-03-01 17:51:13 ระบายย
3095 2018-03-01 17:50:45 @realDonaldTrump I see you’re looking a more tariffs. I’m guessing you’ll turn a blind eye to oil as you and the swamp are so dependent on  Saudi Campaign contributions. Keep terrorism alive! #911
3096 2018-03-01 17:50:26 I found porridge oats, old olive oil & rice

3101 2018-03-01 17:49:59 @LushLtd do the hot oil treatments thicken when you're leave them to cool for 20mins? I just made one up and it's not very thick
3102 2018-03-01 17:49:58 His biceps are the same size as his wrist , mr Olive Oil.
3103 2018-03-01 17:49:55 Ah the American dream, oil, a big gun and a steak.
3104 2018-03-01 17:49:50 Walked in to change my oil and the dude that helps me looks EXACTLY like my ex and I am triggered lmfao. I almost ran out the door 
3105 2018-03-01 17:49:35 Oil filled radiators are great I've got one in my garage heats the room up better than a electric blowy one.
3106 2018-03-01 17:49:32 Schau mal weiter unten bei den Inhaltsstoffen: Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil steht da...
3107 2018-03-01 17:49:32 One benefit of slightly higher gas prices: Frackers are able to operate more profitably & REDUCE dependence on foreign oil, Saudi, Russian & Iranian economic power, and keep price from going to $4/gallon again. Also need to KEEP building windmills, & buying hybrid/electric cars!
3108 2018-03-01 17:49:31 Controversial purchase.
In 5 years from now will this be a wise investment or diminishing brand equity?
Can oil & gas successfully collaborate with first nations? 
Worth a try!
#ClimateAction
3109 2018-03-01 17:49:29 1/2 I have spoken to several Police officers and it is no secret that our Police are using old rusted AK 47 guns. Worse is they don't oil and keep them in shape for appropriate functioning. 
When the armed robbers are using sophisticated weapons.
3110 2018-03-01 17:49:27 Building up my cart on Amazon full of art supplies from paint to oil pastels... imma probably drop about $100-$150

3112 2018-03-01 17:49:03 OH MY GOD I BOUGHT IT. I BOUGHT OIL PAINT
3113 2018-03-01 17:48:57 No. It needs logical solutions to complex problems. 
Not distractions from snake oil vendors like you.
3114 2018-03-01 17:48:52 use something oil based to remove it!
3115 2018-03-01 17:48:22 御社……？
3116 2018-03-01 17:48:18 BRING BACK WHALE OIL!!
3117 2018-03-01 17:48:13 Right...so when they nationalized their oil industry and leveraged their entire economy on the petrodollar...it still isn't socialist enough to be considered socialism since there are still private industries around. Classic apologia.
3118 2018-03-01 17:48:12 If there was a league bias towards the @edmontonoilers nobody in Oil country would be wearing bright orange jerseys with number 97 on the back. #BeRealBud
3119 2018-03-01 17:47:55 who gives a shit if we make steel and aluminum in america or not? we don't make whale oil or buggy whips, or buggies for that matter. has trump not read adam smith on competitive advantage etc?
3120 2018-03-01 17:47:26 omg it feels like college again. here i am burning the midnight oil writing stuff hahahaha the only thing that's missing is a can of monster lol
3121 2018-03-01 17:47:26 Oh just you wait, he'll try to slip funding for his fucking wall into the deal. @realDonaldTrump has been and always will be a con artist and a snak oil salesman.
3122 2018-03-01 17:47:26 Nova posts,
Has anyone had any success with CBD oil?
3123 2018-03-01 17:47:05 300k bisa beli avocado & almond oil haple, the saem aloe vera + w.dressroom 70ml tuh wagelaaaaaaaseeeehhhhh :""""")))))) plus free ongkir huhuhuu i luv shop333333 
3124 2018-03-01 17:47:04 Probably we are too busy haiuling oil because we can’t get a pipeline...
3125 2018-03-01 17:46:54 Olive oil would be my condiment of choice :)
3126 2018-03-01 17:46:52 None of us are arguing this fact! What we are saying is: If we don't sell our oil off shore, buyers will get it elsewhere. Their choices are, Canadian oil which creates revenue for Canada, or Saudi, Iranian, Iraq, etc. Oil and its byproducts = #1 revenue for Canada.
3127 2018-03-01 17:46:50 @_Tynece I just seen you on an hulu olive oil commercial!!!!! Go crazy shorty!!!!!!
3128 2018-03-01 17:46:48 It depends. If the foreign company reinvests locally that can be a positive. OTOH if a foreign company invests here and creates jobs but loses money, is that necessarily a positive or negative? And how do you view something like Imp Oil which is almost 1/2 owner by Exxon?
3129 2018-03-01 17:46:45 Put a lil oil on yo pans after you clean em it helps fight the oxidation that water and air create that cause rust
3130 2018-03-01 17:46:45 Good should find some fucking crystals to jam in her lie hole. Dangerous rich snake oil bitch.
3131 2018-03-01 17:46:43 My dad is so annoying  he wants to turn my sunflowers into oil!
3132 2018-03-01 17:46:40 How you get a discount on an oil change lol for more than 50% off ?
3133 2018-03-01 17:46:26 Getting high from the fumes of this tea tree oil and epsom salt
3134 2018-03-01 17:46:21 We hope this is true to heart
3135 2018-03-01 17:46:18 Tea tree oil is the truth.
3136 2018-03-01 17:46:10 @AudreyRsmith98 Wow! Are oil paints your favorite to work with?
3137 2018-03-01 17:46:07 SCOTLANDS FUTURE STOLEN and go over the next 25 years.  Although much of the remaining oil will have been produced by then, it is still too soon to call time on the economic and engineering miracle that is the North Sea.
3138 2018-03-01 17:45:58 When is he going to bring back the Lamp Lighters and the whale oil industries? He’s so biased.
3139 2018-03-01 17:45:52 really not tryna go get this oil change bro
3140 2018-03-01 17:45:40 China will buy 1.2 a million barrels of Canadian crude oil A DAY... doesn't mean they aren't interested in climate change leadership...it's incremental. Transition to a carbon-free economy requires capital. Build the pipeline and free up rail cars for Saskatchewan wheat. #skpoli
3141 2018-03-01 17:45:37 SCOTLANDS FUTURE STOLEN Under current rules, oil companies dismantling field infrastructure in the North Sea can reclaim a significant share of their costs in the form of a tax refund. However, the process is complicated and potentially subject to change as governments come

3157 2018-03-01 17:44:04 INDEPENDENCE DAY - 25 YRS FROM NOW.it is estimated that £40bn will have to be spent removing redundant platforms and pipelines as well as plugging spent oil wells.   (Then we can get rid of Scotland )

3166 2018-03-01 17:43:24 But in a country with near year round sunlight, why aren’t streetlight using solar technology?  Importing expensive oil to power street lights we can’t pay for is a circuitous debt trap. Why, when God’s free flowing unlimited solar energy is an option? Must Jesus do everything?

3170 2018-03-01 17:43:15 Sorry, did not mean to offend you but every day there is new information and the sector is changing swiftly.Thought you would be very interested having worked in that field. The oil is of tremendous economic importance. Should be managed better with greater investment.

3179 2018-03-01 17:42:40 There has been replacement fuel around forever. The greed of the oil companies has provented it from going farther. Hopefully it wont be too late for the planet.

3182 2018-03-01 17:42:14 Just opened a position on this weakness.  I suspect there was hope for an earnings surprise, that was not realized. Excluding impairment, decent performance, with strong positioning for low cap-ex growth going forward (for a tight oil play) due to now completed E&D program. FWIW

3185 2018-03-01 17:41:58 I just gave myself a hart attack buy opening a box on the dining room table that I thought had oil paints in it only to have a human skeleton with the skull looking right at me. Not falling back asleep tonight.
3186 2018-03-01 17:41:56 I recall seeing an interview with the former CEO of the French oil firm TOTAL, and he said they only bought oil sands products cause Canada was selling them.

3190 2018-03-01 17:41:11 I usually do once every 2 weeks on my cargo bike in winter. My dutch bike had a full chain case and got oil approximately once per chain.
The secret to oiling is to apply lots, let it soak/work it in, then wipe off the stuff on the surface.
3191 2018-03-01 17:41:09 I've recently become obsessed with cheese, rosemary olive oil triscuits, and olives as a snack. And with a glass of wine? 
3192 2018-03-01 17:41:04 OK, sorry about it, I assumed you are a trained philosopher because of your profile name. The priest was right. Jerusalem and Athens are like oil and water...

3195 2018-03-01 17:40:39 I suppose you could use a scented oil thing if you really wanted that... I doubt you'd be able to get any scents out of porous plastic :)
3196 2018-03-01 17:40:37 You are blessed to not have heard of it. Or tried it. 
it's coffee, butter and coconut or oil of your choice. Blended. and then drank.
3197 2018-03-01 17:40:35 Got my oil changed at the dealer. Men in waiting room still love him. Same at my hairdresser yesterday women still behind him. I’m in the Midwest.
3198 2018-03-01 17:40:34 You should try Boli with palm oil next

3202 2018-03-01 17:40:11 Good luck Oli! Need any oil drums? 
3203 2018-03-01 17:40:11 But i use to fry the oil sometimes now 
3204 2018-03-01 17:39:57 I smoke it in its natural form, a few times a week. The oil is effective for some epilepsy but it is prohibitively expensive. I spend $50 and it lasts 3 months. Please understand I'm not advocating everyone ditch their meds. It just works for me and people should have that choice
3205 2018-03-01 17:39:37 It’s only logical that Syria will need that oil to help rebuild their country and Russia is just going to be wanting to help out.   But the time is not yet; only God knows...it’s just like a giant world stage being prepared before the show begins...
3206 2018-03-01 17:39:32 THE CON Instead of preparing for the end of North Sea oil and gas, perhaps the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) should be spending more time thinking about maximising its long-term future. It now has a clear road map set out by

3211 2018-03-01 17:39:10 Slight dip in crude oil price caused some jitters related to #ExxonMobil. I am a bit more optimistic; oil PPB I think will increase on year; bigger concern in my mind is to reset major global strategic initiatives that went awry.#PickingWinners
3212 2018-03-01 17:39:03 i put oil in my car and the caveman in my brain says the car will now blow up if i turn it on.

3223 2018-03-01 17:37:45 I am thinking more like an oil tanker. Although he did go check out CVN 78. But he didn’t like it because it needed more steam. 
3224 2018-03-01 17:37:34 How else would you expect them to import fuels when the oil market is dominated by the petro-dollar. Yes Zimbwabe was considered fine by colonizers when white owned companies were running the country’s economy lmfao.
3225 2018-03-01 17:37:19 Boil some water, add a couple of drops of peppermint oil if you have it, carefully put your face over it and inhale that steam.
3226 2018-03-01 17:37:18 sure and giving a foreign oil company access to our tidewater protects those rights , lol and more guns will protect people and we need to produce more bitumen to combat climate change, all absurd!

3231 2018-03-01 17:36:37 How about that oil discovered in the Golan Heights? It is supposed to be more oil then in all of Saudi Arabia if that’s not the dinner bell to get the attention of the wolves;  I don’t know what else could be. Yeah Russia got their eyes fixated on that.
3232 2018-03-01 17:36:34 do you think Erdogan has connection with ISIS regarding stolen oil business in Syria?

3245 2018-03-01 17:34:45 Have you tried infusing oil? When I was on the crazy restrictive diet, I could use onion and garlic infused oils because that gets the flavor without the fructans (which are often the issue). Worth a try!
3246 2018-03-01 17:34:44 Like the Monarchy, like HS2, like Trident, like Brexit, like the HOL, like the wars in Iraq & Afghanistan, like the squandering of our oil, like last yrs election, like the Buckingham palace renovation, like the renovation of WM. Now do one ya Yoon clown.

3271 2018-03-01 17:31:43 To be fair, Lougheed implemented the HSTF expecting oil production to decline within a decade. A decade later revenues dropped and they started drawing off the fund. Basically all part of their intended plan.

3285 2018-03-01 17:30:24 I guess I could have provided more nuance, but automation reduced jobs. The average American in WV, KY, et al, don't own a coal mine. Fracking and oil subsidies provided the steady bleed of market share enjoyed in the 20th century. After China invested in solar, coal lost.

3310 2018-03-01 17:26:59 The miners jumped on the opportunity of the oil crisis and exploited it. They were not in a mood to compromise.
3311 2018-03-01 17:26:40 QP begins today on new EA process and offshore oil. PC Keith Hutchings asking what assurances new approach won’t slow offshore development.
3312 2018-03-01 17:26:22 Typical of the hyperbole in politics today. Horgan himself is just as guilty of playing in that same pool. It's time that we started demanding our politicians grow up and start acting like statesmen instead of snake oil salesmen.
3313 2018-03-01 17:26:18 If you are a business or property owner affected by the BP oil spill, you may be entitled to recompense, even if you do not realize it.

3316 2018-03-01 17:26:01 My forehead and nose peel all the time they're that dry :( bio oil seems to be helping it tho sooo
3317 2018-03-01 17:26:00 It doesn’t suit everyone, but it does work. In simple terms, it’s a very low carbohydrate diet, with moderate levels of protein and high levels of fat. Think eggs and bacon for breakfast, chicken and avocado salad with an olive oil dressing for lunch 1/2
3318 2018-03-01 17:25:54 I enjoyed the design essentials leave in mask. If I remember correctly it's the coconut milk one.

3321 2018-03-01 17:25:28 I have never said this was a good deal. In fact it was a bad deal, but it is better than doing nothing.

3326 2018-03-01 17:24:47 Just got the call & Monday I officially start with Murphy Oil Corporation  No more contractor or 3rd party work. Finally gonna work straight for a production company. This has been a goal of mine since I got in measurement oil/gas field back in May 2014. Very blessed rn 
3327 2018-03-01 17:24:45 GETTING IT NOW  However, that sum doesn’t come close to reflecting the true value of the North Sea to the British economy. Total tax receipts from oil and gas production from the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) since 1975 have exceeded £330bn but that figure doesn’t reflect
3328 2018-03-01 17:24:41 Yep, castor oil works wonders
3329 2018-03-01 17:24:36 I have a stupid / inflated / completely misplaced sense of accomplishment in managing to find time to get an oil change yesterday.

3347 2018-03-01 17:21:58 You seem to be out of date with information. I would have thought you would have found new and very different views of how the oil industry is developing of interest. But, of course, if it doesn't fit your agenda that is understandable.
3348 2018-03-01 17:21:53 Bro I took an olive oil tour in Croatia. Worlds best olive oil. U wouldn’t believe what real olive oil tastes like anymore. 90% is 100% fake. Like legit fake oil.

3350 2018-03-01 17:21:40 already checked the condenser pipe - looks like the water pump has blown. We have a small oil heater and 2 fan heaters. Jazz has one of those in her room. I slept(badly) in full clothes and a hat last night
3351 2018-03-01 17:21:18 so far today i’ve spilled an entire container of coconut oil on my desk and all over my belongings, lost one of my favorite earrings, and now it’s raining and i can’t find my umbrella someone put me out of my misery
3352 2018-03-01 17:20:55 THIS The first oil produced off the north-east coast of Scotland arrived for processing onshore in the summer of 1975, more than 43bn barrels of crude have been pumped. That crude has been worth around £1.4 trillion – a figure greater than the country’s entire national debt
3353 2018-03-01 17:20:54 @wellingspeter1 whilst on the subject of boycotting Scottish products, let’s start with oil. We can just as easily get it refined in Rotterdam if you prefer?
3354 2018-03-01 17:20:50 So all industries have competitors, and downside risks..the oil risk (just to take one) is exemplified by the renewables/green agenda switch and USA fracking capabilities (and eventually the Middle East switch from mono-cultural economies, rebasing away from oil)
3355 2018-03-01 17:20:44 I’m actually going there today I need flower and oil
3356 2018-03-01 17:20:41 I'm saying that the density and buoyancy of various minerals found in the ground differs based upon each type. If d/b were true, minerals should appear in layers consistent with the differences in mass (like oil in water) but they don't.
3357 2018-03-01 17:20:27 Thanks for the info!
3358 2018-03-01 17:20:26 Sonofabitch, that’s funny! Good one.
3359 2018-03-01 17:20:20 Sure. A good start off is to not leave the house, order only fast food and oil based foods. Next don’t attempt to move once you’ve sat.. unless it’s for food. Remember, If you aren’t eating right now, you’re failing

3391 2018-03-01 17:17:32 Technically not true. Robots kept coal alive much longer than it should have by lowering the cost, and human risk in the industry. Alternative energy may have given the last blow, but oil subsidies made coal unable to compete in the first place.
3392 2018-03-01 17:17:30 Is this the explanation for no oil being deliverd to a 95 year old pensioner yesterday. Highway robbery of oil perhaps? 39mins on hold waiting for answer.... no reply to my email as yet either... who's the real criminal boilerjuice

3402 2018-03-01 17:16:38 PET plastic is the most common material used for single-use bottled beverages...it is...easy to recycle. It takes more than 1.5 million barrels of oil to produce a year's supply of water bottles. That's enough oil to fuel 100,000 cars for a year.

3404 2018-03-01 17:16:30 So instead of our government setting standards we should let foreign gobs decide? Should we stop the import of oil into our country too?

3414 2018-03-01 17:15:25 Same thing with oil.  We don’t need oil nearly as much as they say we do.

3439 2018-03-01 17:12:47 EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES:Barely two weeks after the release of some lecturers prospecting for oil at the Chad Basin, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC,has concluded arrangement to recommence exploration activities at the basin,
3440 2018-03-01 17:12:31 Oil Prices edged lower, extending losses after data showed a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks.
3441 2018-03-01 17:12:26 oil looking to touch that 61.50 level-   ES not letting it...   The battle..
3442 2018-03-01 17:12:16 Where’s a good place to get an oil change
3443 2018-03-01 17:12:14 Today on Tommy has brain damage... I thought that the place I was getting oil changed was 4 minutes away. It's actuallly on the other side of Cleveland.
3444 2018-03-01 17:12:05 yeah ...cheers Adrian !!
3445 2018-03-01 17:12:03 However, among those attending are Johnnie Langendorff,  hero of Sutherland Springs and Colo Rep. Patrick Neville, Columbine survivor

3454 2018-03-01 17:10:42 if they are tied to major oil company or national distro then deliveries are all done by a computer
3455 2018-03-01 17:10:19 I like to think MCT oil stands for Migos Chain Triglyceride

3458 2018-03-01 17:09:47 Its all about the resources Ted,,you know that worthless scottish oil and gas that England manages for us
Then takes 92% of it for doing so
3459 2018-03-01 17:09:40 Wanting retribution on a country that literally had no involvement at all in the 9/11 attack. USA's involvement in Iraq was due to imaginary WMD's.......oil, nothing to do with 9/11.
3460 2018-03-01 17:09:39 I think the closest thing is weed infused olive oil (which is really good for you) so you could cook veggies with that I guess
3461 2018-03-01 17:09:36 They have some superstores that carry everything from jewelry to furniture. I’ve never been in one but it wouldn’t surprise me if they do sell firearms.
3462 2018-03-01 17:09:29 It's true.
3463 2018-03-01 17:09:28 I agree Aiden. We already have too much tanker traffic on the coast and we don’t need to add any more with oil from Alberta.
3464 2018-03-01 17:09:04 Lolol facts hold off I got beard oil coming 
3465 2018-03-01 17:09:03 Idk if they are strictly oil free but cetaphil has non comedogenic ones and also fragrance free, and those are good
3466 2018-03-01 17:08:59 Dont accept it if you like,,it does not make it any less true
92% is UK gov`s own figures Ted
I was a unionist for 30 years Ted so dont give me your "everyone moved on" shite,reality is if scots gave WM oil and gas we would be indy by friday
3467 2018-03-01 17:08:48 Some people he wenty back by the reason, stayed here a person with oil.
3468 2018-03-01 17:08:38 Baby Boomers want oil out of the middle east and, travel bans, and for Russia to disappear. Millennials just want memes, serotonin, and more bees.
3469 2018-03-01 17:08:13 Dude. Syria has little oil. They are #60 in global production between Ivory Coast and Belarus with Mongolia and Albania nipping at their heels. Italy produces more than double what Syria does. Take off the tin foil.
3470 2018-03-01 17:08:08 It's this little place in Clarksville TN! I make a mean braised filet and lamb chop with Zucchini stir fry, using some rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, and a splash of sesame oil after deglazing the pan from the steaks! #reasontovisitagain
3471 2018-03-01 17:07:51 TIL: there is an OPEC-style cartel that controls the majority of the world's supply of a liquid that is 25x more expensive than oil. That cartel is the Federation Of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers.

3474 2018-03-01 17:07:32 I hope so too!! Sad to see so much negative out there. I wonder how many of the people who think “vitamins are snake oil” have looked into nutrition/how it impacts your whole life. There are tons of junk items in the market. Tati would only bring us the real deal!!
3475 2018-03-01 17:07:15 Remember Sir Ian Wood of the Wood group joyfully telling Scotland there was no oil left, before the Indy ref.
3476 2018-03-01 17:06:54 I just never use olive oil at all anymore. Avocado is good to like 500 F
3477 2018-03-01 17:06:52 I'll have to file a complaint, at least about the lack of an oil light. The irony seems to be that other Darts have had recalls due to other problems that stall the car while driving. The difference being, those weren't part of the intentional design. This one is . @Dodge
3478 2018-03-01 17:06:49 omg i hate fish oil

3481 2018-03-01 17:06:43 The best way to have it is to run a little olive oil in it and roast it. So delicious
3482 2018-03-01 17:06:10 It’d be worth it to lower the suicide and homicide rate.
3483 2018-03-01 17:05:57 Hi. Thanks for info again. Was there several oil infested birds? I've already seen a King Eider w oil. Very concerning if there are more..
3484 2018-03-01 17:05:54 Lip oil by @clarinsusa
3485 2018-03-01 17:05:49 The use of oil and NG reduce CO2 emissions by replacing coal power plants. It’s better for the environment and it creates jobs.
3486 2018-03-01 17:05:34 Go on youtube and type burning the midnight oil by porter wagner and dolly parton...listen da song

3490 2018-03-01 17:05:17 Two hours at the dealership for a fucking oil change
3491 2018-03-01 17:05:16 Trying some peppermint oil around the house to see if that keeps mice away.

3493 2018-03-01 17:04:53 Quick shout out to @LPGHomeHeat. (Like an idiot) Ran out of oil this morning. Emergency delivery by lunch time 
Probably saved my marriage too!
3494 2018-03-01 17:04:45 I heard that there are 3 locked offices, before getting into Pruitt's.He must feel seriously guilty about what he's doing to the earth.All he's getting is cash from the oil,coal,& fracking industries. Soon he won't be able to breathe,& he'll know exactly why.
3495 2018-03-01 17:04:45 wtf kinda freedom do the US military give anyone they beat up Vietnamese Rice farmers and invade vulnerable countries for oil and call it "war"

3497 2018-03-01 17:04:39 Use grapeseed oil. Neutral and very high smoking point. Rarely use olive oil in high temp applications.
3498 2018-03-01 17:04:19 Oil and water don't integrate!!!
3499 2018-03-01 17:04:05 Nor oil barons or shipping heirs I should expect

3501 2018-03-01 17:04:00 I only use beard oil extracted from the beards of free range, non-GMO vikings
3502 2018-03-01 17:03:58 Given violent & skilled history of the rivalry, who'd have thought this issue would unite Oil & Flames fans.
3503 2018-03-01 17:03:58 One thing I’m gonna miss when I’m not not nannying anymore is being able to run errands and get oil changes while Im working

3506 2018-03-01 17:03:48 They wanted people to oppose the pipeline in favor of Russia's deal with Exxon to drill in the artic. It didn't work because Exxon announced today it had cancelled its oil drilling deal with Russia.
3507 2018-03-01 17:03:45 Ok the problem with @TooFaced peach oil lipglosses is that they’re rly good.. but they also taste amazing so they last about ten minutes before I’ve licked it off completely.....

3509 2018-03-01 17:03:36 I got sick of “olive oil” burning (it is supposed to have a high burn temp) and switching to avocado was a game changer
3510 2018-03-01 17:03:10 For the same reason they sell furniture, TVs and motor oil; some of their stores are not pure grocery stores but are combo grocery/general merchandise mega-stores. Common here in fly-over country
3511 2018-03-01 17:03:06 If I give you the best brand from Cotonou, will you be willing to buy?
I always educate my Customers because just like Rice, there are fake groundnut oil brands in the market.. All it takes is for them to mix the content and gum stickers of known brands on them..
3512 2018-03-01 17:03:05 All sea creatures die after a few years. 
Their bodies sink to the bottom of the ocean. 
Movements in the earth crust transform those sea creatures into fuel. 
Coal, oil and gas are created.
Coal is mined. Oil and gas are just pumped out of the ground.
This is a miracle

3513 2018-03-01 17:02:41 Not central heating. I have a storage heater and oil filled radiator in the living room and that combination has sufficed for the last 12 years but this weather has chewed up their heat & spat it out! Just bought a fan heater to pick up the slack. Now 11 degrees and rising

Pls RT
3527 2018-03-01 17:01:18 We were having an interesting discussion on #Innovation the other day and some folks disagreed on a mention of #data & oil. On reflection, I agree we should rephrase. My suggestion - “Data is not the new oil - it’s the new WATER ” #MITSMRChat
3528 2018-03-01 17:01:12 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.

Seven Sisters was formed back in 1951 to control the world's oil and gas industry. Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Mobil, Texaco, Gulf and Chevron were members of this cartel.

3532 2018-03-01 17:01:02 Sorry David, if people don't understand the difference between a state oil company and an oil fund, with revenues from taxation, they really shouldn't comment. Remind us all how many operators in the North Sea are sitting on tax losses?

3555 2018-03-01 16:58:55 Bullshit, this is the GOP trying to make activists less credible by labeling everything that criticizes oil and gas, the report issued by GOP Senator who took $700,000 from the industry. This is going to lead to a crackdown on protesters in the name of national security.
3556 2018-03-01 16:58:55 Just had my first oil delivery of this year. Huge difference since i insulated my house in the spring.

3576 2018-03-01 16:56:13 She got me some beard oil. Which I never used and it makes it so much softer. Also cause I have a little hair on my head it keeps my hair moisturized throughout the day when I use.
3577 2018-03-01 16:55:35 I’m so rickety that I need a fish oil, glucosamine and turmeric drip every day from here on out.

3580 2018-03-01 16:55:19 You're welcome... it's my beard oil and beard balm...
3581 2018-03-01 16:55:13 Somehow your subconscious insulates you from the trauma, it knows what you can handle and at what time. For years I seemed absolutely frozen and then one time I had a memory of her shaking oil & vinegar in a sauce jar and started wailing. Always honor the love!

3594 2018-03-01 16:53:30 I lost all my damn adderrals, my car needs an oil change, I'm hungry asf, and Im sick and tired of going to meetings.

3596 2018-03-01 16:53:25 @2EP0L We hear you there. Have you taken care of the oil change?
3597 2018-03-01 16:53:14 60 Minutes reported the Olive Oil scam. It’s a big deal. Swapping for seed oil, which is bad especially if someone’s allergic. Could kill someone.
3598 2018-03-01 16:53:14 Bet... they also said I have a small oil leak. Then got an attitude when I declined. I drove a TL with an oil leak for years. Don’t underestimate my Accord
3599 2018-03-01 16:53:13 Great opportunity out here. Not very expensive, my mortgage will be low, and oil out here is growing and this town is growing. It'll be a great investment within the years

3609 2018-03-01 16:52:02 Probably so. They're pretty cheap. And some places that do oil will change it for you.
3610 2018-03-01 16:51:59 I don't need to read these, I've worked in the oil industry for over 30 years. I know the industry will be around for a while yet, it's the revenues I'm on about. When I questioned oil revenues in 2014 I was dismissed as a "fool". What do I know?

1. Dems controlled both houses in 73-74
2. Arab oil embargo => gas prices soared => economy tanked
3. POTUS approval plunged to 25%

As long as economy holds up, Trump will be >30% and Dems won't have juice to toss him.

3628 2018-03-01 16:50:09 Do you really think oil is going to dissappear? Sorry 2 disappoint you, but probably not in your lifetime. Canada has to sustain it's ethical oil at least until other viable sources of energy have been worked out.

3631 2018-03-01 16:49:47 No one in the US military is currently “fighting for our rights” / “fighting for the constitution” so can we give up this narrative???? Oil. That’s what our soldiers are fighting for lol. Oil
3632 2018-03-01 16:49:45 Arguably, that is what economic sanctions look like. I remember when #Venezuala used to send free heating oil to New England during shortages. And this is how we repay them....
3633 2018-03-01 16:49:21 Good questions. I saw the aftermath firsthand after #tarsands oil poured into a marsh draining into Arkansas's biggest recreational fishing area. We can only hope the local #media is asking these questions too but don't hold your breath.

3636 2018-03-01 16:49:11 Part 1 Eisenhower overthrow friend Iran because of oil.  Truman and coal on net. USA nationalized industries WW1, WW2.

3650 2018-03-01 16:47:05 If you note. USA is now a net exporter of oil. This is having a dramatic effect on the attempts by OPEC to manipulate oil prices. Gas & oil are high skilled industries creating many lucrative jobs. UK production is a ways off, mainly through dithering. But exploration takes time.
3651 2018-03-01 16:47:04 Ayer fui a la oil a comprar los bocaditos Marroc y casi lloro cuando ví que salían $10(un balazo dolía menos). Que bronca ser gorda, pobre y con gustos caros

3653 2018-03-01 16:46:59 Stop telling people about Zim and Ven or outline all the details that led to their "fall". Saudi has oil nationalized, china owns its land, or would you like that we school you?
3654 2018-03-01 16:46:52 Thanks for raising the visibility of this issue. Our oil, gas and power supply chains are vulnerable, and smart transport and automated & connected vehicles are extending the risk. I’m all areas there is huge secondary damage potential. Standards are essential.
3655 2018-03-01 16:46:47 Bear Head LNG proposed plant, in the maritimes, is starved for CDN Nat Gas. All this talk about CDN budgets, equality etc yet we still can't get a pipe built to carry CDN gas or oil to the east coast.  It didn't get done under Harper and it's not getting under Trudeau
3656 2018-03-01 16:46:45 Thank you!  Congratulations to you as well! Such a great contest because everyone wins funds for their charity regardless of the standings!

3658 2018-03-01 16:46:02 While purchasing fries at @PizzaPizzaLtd don't hazitate to ask when the oil was changed. Many locations changes oil once a week only. I can already feel my arteries clogging up.
3659 2018-03-01 16:45:45 Yeah it affects the popultion that all assets of Maduro in the US are frozen, get out of here. It doesnt have anything to do the fact that oil production went from 3.6MM/d to 1.3MM/d? And went from 30.000 employees to 300.000?
3660 2018-03-01 16:45:35 @Richzeoli From our fake news dept: The following firearms Cos. have announced they will no longer be manufacturing weapons:

3663 2018-03-01 16:45:08 Perhaps Glenn, but there are people on these shores advocating we entrust our economic stability to the very people who thought selling off our state oil company was a good idea, and setting up an oil fund was a bad one.
3664 2018-03-01 16:45:03 Okay @Yellow_Cardinal, gray-striped or black oil?
3665 2018-03-01 16:44:46 Would the Rockefeller's be funding anti oil groups in Canada because they are opposed to and have no oil interests? Just wondering!

3676 2018-03-01 16:42:38 Ah yes global climate problems, the catastrophic environmental effects of fracking, and Native Americans not wanting to drink oil contaminated water that comes from a pipeline on sacred ground is really a Russian psyop

3678 2018-03-01 16:42:22 You are right. If Thatcher hadn’t created her sovereign wealth fund with our oil revenues instead of keeping 4million unemployed for ten years as her cabinet wanted then we wouldn’t be able to fund our wonderful social care system.

3682 2018-03-01 16:41:57 Chick Fil A nugget fans, try this.

3697 2018-03-01 16:40:17 Look at Colorado, opioid abuse and overdoses are down considerably, they are getting so much revenue that citizens will soon be getting checks from the state like Alaska for oil revenues, infrastructure is being rebuilt, schools fully funded, but I guess you think that is bad.

3699 2018-03-01 16:39:57 u nailed the problem with your last sentence. vast energy reserves not being tapped because energy extraction monopolized by MNCs.
perfect example is california that stopped building refineries in the 1980s so it has to send oil out of state to refine. whoa! #lavidaloca
3700 2018-03-01 16:39:52 Not sure how that would stand in court - excessive vs the act. Man, oil companies don’t get that much fir spills off our coast !
3701 2018-03-01 16:39:37 I'm sure this vision of death is only to be responsibly used on primitive peoples who have the misfortune of living near an area claimed by a leader who prefers to sell oil in a currency other than USD.

3716 2018-03-01 16:38:12 I mean, he’s locked up for the next 8 years so the only way he can get out is if the Oil trades him, which they would NEVER. He should’ve signed a bridge that took him to UFA so he could at least have that leverage working for him. Chiarelli really is something
3717 2018-03-01 16:38:02 Nope oil rocket and the dollar just tanked
3718 2018-03-01 16:37:45 Congratulations!
3719 2018-03-01 16:37:39 Does Chintu use coconut oil?
3720 2018-03-01 16:37:19 Olive oil, salt/pepper, and garlic. Then you can add any sauce you like if you want.
3721 2018-03-01 16:37:04 My battle to eat healthier has been so much easier since I decided not to fret about salt or butter or oil. Regularly eating moderately healthy meals is a better outcome than a mix of super healthy high aspirations food and packaged cheat meals.

What flavor is your Kool-aid?
I went to elementary school in the '70's.
I was told I was going to freeze to death and oil wells were going to dry up soon.
How'd that prediction work out?
Made up crises.....
3724 2018-03-01 16:36:40 Black people and danger....we like water and oil 
3725 2018-03-01 16:36:35 อ่อ ขอบคุณมาค่าาา
3726 2018-03-01 16:36:34 Ahh! Got it! Yes, Ali Baba wouldn't have had enough oil barrels...
3727 2018-03-01 16:36:33 oil
3728 2018-03-01 16:36:28 Mine too. Due to problems with the lorries he’d only just done his first delivery at 3.30. He left home at 4.30 this morning! Still 12 to do. It’s heating oil so he’s determined to get them done. Another late night 
3729 2018-03-01 16:36:26 Coworkers are trying to replace our Dial antibacterial, “environment killer” soap with some essential oil/botanical brands. Why are they stealing my joy?!
3730 2018-03-01 16:36:20 And oil!

3732 2018-03-01 16:36:17 Smells like wood and some sort of oil/paint combo?
3733 2018-03-01 16:36:17 You want that new car smell?  Here's how: 1 part Windex, 2 parts 10w40 motor oil, 1 part Turtle Wax.  Mix thoroughly, rub near the air intake.  Boom, new car smell.
3734 2018-03-01 16:36:13 I've just been to the shed to get my oil heaters out. My eco house isn't coping in the snow
3735 2018-03-01 16:36:09 How can we have the major networks start looking into this interference of other entities in Canadian oil and gas industries?

3738 2018-03-01 16:36:02 Anyway. Got a ginger bath oil so hopefully that helps my joints feel better and less stiff. Right now my hips are swollen up fuckin fierce. Really not liking the cold.
3739 2018-03-01 16:35:57 Renewables are an attack on coal, every bit of ground they get they take from coal and oil. There was plenty of thought given to workers, there are training programs and assistance programs to help workers transition to a new field. But they refuse to do anything with it.
3740 2018-03-01 16:35:47 @Jbams01 Another sub helped with my oil issue so the only other things were that someone blocked the wither skellie farm by claiming the entrance, and there was a dark spot near spawn that was spawning zombies that were wrecking new players
3741 2018-03-01 16:35:45 I have a conspiracy theory that Putin and Trump are working together to open up the artic circle for oil drilling, new tech makes it possible, Putin  planted a Russian flag at the North Pole & Trump pulling out of Paris Accord Climate & being money hungry climate change denier

3744 2018-03-01 16:35:39 I bought more #Newalta at open. Can you believe a near bankrupt penny stock has been my best performing oil stock in a sea of gteat names? Up 25% on merger notice with #Trevita.  Ill keep adding energy as long as this disaster lasts.
3745 2018-03-01 16:35:25 The AHA would have people thinking it’s bad to sprinkle Maldon on a pile of wilted greens, to eat like, fat free yogurt instead. NO! Eat your leafy greens doused in olive oil with the delicious delicious salt.

3749 2018-03-01 16:34:32 I'm eyeing oil at 58.50ish, so much slop to pop and chop
3750 2018-03-01 16:34:19 Tell us, why aren't these COSTS absorbed in the profit margins? It's no different than when the Oil & Gas Industry refuses to absorb ANY COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. It should be absorbed in their RECORD PROFIT MARGINS- not redistributed onto CONSUMERS via price manipulation.
3751 2018-03-01 16:34:15 sometimes i just wanna eat bread with butter and sugar but i only have sugar in the raw bc my mom says white sugar is bad and on top of that we never have butter my roommates are into healthy stuff so we just get olive oil 
3752 2018-03-01 16:33:56 Had been using Italian virgin olive oil for a week. Stocked up Kalamata extra virgin olive oil, Kalamata olives and Greek green olives, and two types of tomatoes the moment the shops announced they are closing down. Can you guess if this is an Irish or Greek run household? 
3753 2018-03-01 16:33:47 @Gibson3G why! Is there oil that we can mine on that plot! $23000.Geez

3755 2018-03-01 16:33:35 if Trump imposes duties on steel and aluminum imports it’s time for canada to start taking similar actions on oil lumber wheat grain fish and FRESH WATER, trump can’t unilaterally void nafta and impose duties without violating the trade agreements. I hope the PM is watching

3758 2018-03-01 16:33:04 Ladies, I need your help. I've been removing toxins from my daily life, and stopped putting them on my skin, too.

Since I've changed my way of eating and replaced my conventional moisturizer product with an essential oil blend, my skin looks and feels great!

3761 2018-03-01 16:32:34 A5: When I was in HS Auto the teacher would let us change our oil or do different things that needed to be done to our vehicles during class.  This gave hands on learning to everyone in the class and saved us some money. #ap3040
3762 2018-03-01 16:32:32 Fml my car is just now going in for the oil change. I WANNA GET ON THE ROADDDD
3763 2018-03-01 16:32:19 The fact that you cannot deny that #ClimateChange exists and is getting worse is getting old. Also, that article proves nothing. You are just another climate change denying big oil supporter. That is sad. #StopKM #NoPipelines #KeepItInTheGround #cdnpoli

3766 2018-03-01 16:31:49 I will not agree. They have done very well in the non oil revenue push(especially taxes). I'm actually surprised how well they've done but I maintain that we were never meant to hit recession. Dip? Yes, maybe even one negative quarter. But recession? Nah
3767 2018-03-01 16:31:44 This is like the oil leak in the Gulf...there is treachary and deceipt from every corner of LNP shadows and playgrounds...there is no good left in them devoid of profit for supporters and members...Its a scorched and salted earth job..Even hitler didnt delve so low..#theworst
3768 2018-03-01 16:31:21 @arganatural  Help! Your Argan Body Hydrating Coconut Oil is the only formula that doesn’t give me a rash. I use it on my skin and hair. How can I get more?
3769 2018-03-01 16:31:20 Jamaican Castor Oil smells disgustingggg but it works wonders 
3770 2018-03-01 16:31:19 I loooove asparagus! I usually wrap it in foil with the salmon and olive oil and seasoning then baked it so the flavors mix together  sooo good!
3771 2018-03-01 16:31:15 What if the government keeps printing money and then oil trades in gold instead of US dollars and the economy collapses and we don’t pay our military/police anymore and now you are the only one defending you. Would you prefer to have 2 bullets or 20?
3772 2018-03-01 16:31:14 The easiest thing you can do is to stop sending them your oil to stop fuelling their war machines

3782 2018-03-01 16:30:01 Actually, the world would have squeezed all the oil out of them. Your heart is in the right place but the quote is wrong...
3783 2018-03-01 16:30:01 Yeah peel, slice, toss in a bowl with oil, salt and pepper, lay on a sheet and roast at 400F for 15-20.
3784 2018-03-01 16:29:52 I never used the white before,I’m more of a coconut oil type of person..my skin and beard,and nose loves it
3785 2018-03-01 16:29:52 Cool. Except the part where oil companies cannot be sued for their crimes. That part doesn’t sit well with me. Why do they deserve a free pass when they maliciously lied to the public and paid politicians to do the same?
3786 2018-03-01 16:29:40 Trying to get more creative with my breakfast. Shredded turkey with black currant jam and sliced sweet potatoes with olive oil. It's like a mini turkey dinner.. Just easier haha
3787 2018-03-01 16:29:33 Lol city fans. Wonder if they had sense of humour when they were struggling in league 1? If the oil money didn’t come in they would be in championship right now
3788 2018-03-01 16:29:30 @CPSFuels hi guys we are waiting for our oil to be delivered. We ordered the weekend for latest today delivery. We have now run out. Will you still be coming today?
3789 2018-03-01 16:29:12 I could be making hair oil, body lotion, soap and candles today, but the tendon in my hip has decided that's not happening.
3790 2018-03-01 16:29:11 Thanks for trusting us to take on your oil changes! Your support really means a lot.
3791 2018-03-01 16:29:03 You can use olive oil with cotton to remove the colours. This is after washing it in cold water for a few minutes#HoliBeautySecret
3792 2018-03-01 16:28:50 Today we celebrate National Pig Day with a healthy dose of America's Favorite Snack Food. I forgot to acquire some bacon drippings for the ppcn, so we will pretend with our plant based oil.  Yes, our ppcn contains some fat, but it's mostly air and you know we need air to survive.
3793 2018-03-01 16:28:30 Because oil will be necessary even when liberty isn’t.

3797 2018-03-01 16:28:16 ... been the same. No one helped us, no one cared, they had their own problems. The Steel Mill plight was joined by the manufacturers, the coal miners, the oil drillers & so on. So Mr. President, MAGA, give us back our hope & pride, help our families for our kids. I’m for 1st
3798 2018-03-01 16:28:14 Not an oil lamp? Or maybe a torch?

3800 2018-03-01 16:28:03 Apparently a tiny amount of olive oil stops the snow sticking. We have a Labrador so don’t need to try it out.

3802 2018-03-01 16:27:40 Just do a straight comparison with Norway and tell me why they are not subsidised. Similar sized population, large oil resource, smaller exports... yet somehow FAR more prosperous and besting the "UK" in just about every quality of life comparison...

3808 2018-03-01 16:26:54 I think you need some oil, your gears are creaking
3809 2018-03-01 16:26:40 Lol ngl I’ve been banging that castor oil for months now, still no results. 
3810 2018-03-01 16:26:39 That's a crazy concept figuring The United States is the number one oil producer in the world right now
3811 2018-03-01 16:26:25 Red onion, carrot sliced into strips, broccoli, sliced red and green peppers, ginger powder, salt and pepper, garlic. Cooked that for a few minutes in a pan with vegetable oil. Added steam fried noodles that were cooked before hand. Added some soy sauce and stirred for a bit.
3812 2018-03-01 16:26:21 Sold over $65,000 of Hemp CBD oil in the month of February  if it wasn't working do you think I would be in business still?
3813 2018-03-01 16:26:18 Erika, I did a little research and came across this blend of Frankincense, Lavendar and Myrrh (5 drops each). You could create your own rollerball with fractionated coconut oil or I also mix the oils in a sm glass container with reg coconut oil so it’s like a lotion

3816 2018-03-01 16:26:06 Indeed, I think the Norwegian oil fund is basically an example of this (the pensions part at least). How the money gets invested obviously still key for wider societal impact - eg infrastructure vs growth assets

3822 2018-03-01 16:25:32 Where did the govt get the FX from? It was either through borrowings or the improving oil price... No matter what we want to say...until we move way from being an oil dependent economy... This recession will be a recurring decimal.

3836 2018-03-01 16:24:40 Those sanctions dont affect the top officials, it affects the population which cnt get the same access to food/medicine. U think the U.S wasnt behind the drop in oil prices too? They waited until Chavez died to apply their usual hammer on Venezuela, like they did with Cuba
3837 2018-03-01 16:24:40 I agree with @SecretaryZinke that solar panels belong on homes/businesses & not spread across thousands of acres of America's #publiclands. Of course, coal mines and oil wells spread across millions of acres of #publicland is OK with Zinke. #CognitiveDissonance #MTPol @aaronflint
3838 2018-03-01 16:24:36 Ahhh, nothing better then a lack of foreign dollar investments, Oil companies now either shutting down projects or clawing back on initial investment allocations (Exxon) and interest rates rising,  Hmm seems like the recent Liberal budget should help though!

3858 2018-03-01 16:23:39 Easy...get a brillo pad, clean the entire pan, rinse, dry with towel, then sit it on the stove to dry completely. Get some flaxseed oil & rub all over the pan with a napkin, turn ya oven on as high as it goes, sit pan in for an hour...wahhlaa

3868 2018-03-01 16:22:33 All the things you mentioned are the secondary symptoms... What caused the FX crisis... Inability to meet the current FX consumption with the revenue reality due to drop in Govt receipts from oil. So rationing occurred and that worsen the situation. We keep saying away from oil
3869 2018-03-01 16:22:30 It's hard to believe CNN still airs Jack Kingston, we turn the channel when he speaks, snake oil salesman!

3884 2018-03-01 16:21:15 People of Bombay, hope you’ve made a trip to Chandni Halwai for some Sindhi Ghaeyer because is it even #holi if you’re not stuffing your face with moon-sized jalebi and mom’s failed attempts at making samosas “healthy”. This year she’s using wheat flour, olive oil!
3885 2018-03-01 16:21:13 And solar energy has been here longer than oil  and so have water and wind
3886 2018-03-01 16:21:11 You invest in oil production while the level of oil prices allows you to pay back expenses and pay salaries.

3917 2018-03-01 16:18:11 I am honestly surprised and sad that this is the direction that Tati is going in. It feels so out of left field since she never really talks about supplements before. The brand video just felt like her shilling some snake oil product.

3924 2018-03-01 16:17:31 Isn't it rich! A grifters standing up for a fellow grifters. Trump made his money selling his snake oil. You made your money as a Prophet for Profit! You will meet your judgement day when God asks you why didn't you stand for good, and enrich others instead of just yourself!
3925 2018-03-01 16:17:27 This is good news for inflation. Lower oil, lower inflation, less pressure on Fed to raise rates 4 times.
3926 2018-03-01 16:17:25 How does he stimulate spending sir? From low revenue from oil. He needed the money so he blocked excess drain of govt monies... Living people who depends on this to survive dry. People were living off this leakages in govt revenue. So when it stopped... Hell was let loose

3955 2018-03-01 16:13:27 You're still blinded by the butthurt of your anointed Crooked Hillary losing.  POTUS in one action undercut Russia more than any token sanctions. He opened up US oil to the world market.  Russia faces a demographic timebomb and now has no money. Paper Tiger

Wow the arrogance of the uneducated or pseudoeducated is incredible.
3961 2018-03-01 16:12:44 The fact is oil is a dying industry that most countries are moving away feom and most companies are divesting from.  Supporting it will hurt the people, wildlife, environment and economy of Alberta.

3976 2018-03-01 16:11:03 Good hydrating serums and occlusive creams at bedtime do the trick for me. Vaseline might be too thick for you but it’s awesome for me especially around my mouth area. Helps seal water in so it doesn’t leave but if you’re oily it can do that for oil too

4004 2018-03-01 16:08:29 Oil money will have run out by then
4005 2018-03-01 16:08:22 The economy is performing well but obviously commodities have much further to go (Harper had $100 oil and couldn't get new pipelines built, and ran deficits).  But in general growth was less than forecast. But we're solid.
4006 2018-03-01 16:08:19 Just keeps heading back to 60$ every now then....oh u OIL ... I GUESS D WORLD IS NO LONGER A FOOL AND KNOWS THE CORRECT PRICE OF OIL @OPEC @Khalid_AlFalh and all your games to keep it over inflated...OOPS.

4013 2018-03-01 16:07:31 Flood the markets with crude oil and take down the price to $25 barrel in 1 month they won't have food to eat let alone spend money on this program ! #simple @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
4014 2018-03-01 16:07:05 Someone forget to oil the machine?
4015 2018-03-01 16:06:48 Oil money.
4016 2018-03-01 16:06:43 A los que dicen que US no puede dejar de comprar petróleo a Venny... léanse ese artículo de como el oil pesado de Canadá se está empezando a usar en las refinerías acostumbradas al pio venezolano.  Arepas de petróleo van a tener q comer. 
4017 2018-03-01 16:06:41 In 2014/15 GERS figures oil revenues were £2.25 billion, Scotland's deficit was 9.7% GDP (UK was 4.9%). The average Brent crude price in 2014 was £98.89 dollars per barrel.

4020 2018-03-01 16:06:16 It wasn’t an oil tanker. Do you want to stop all freight vessels now? Also the US already ships oil down our coast from Alaska.
4021 2018-03-01 16:06:14 Oil arriving now. Phew.
4022 2018-03-01 16:06:12 Sorry, implying oil spills and shot aren't "real environmental concerns?"
4023 2018-03-01 16:06:05 And Exxon has withdrawn their oil deal in Russia  worth half a trillion dollars... Not sure how many rubles. Regardless Exxon says nyet! What'll Putin's honoring #SecOfstate #RExxonTillerson  medalo friendship mean now? on back maybe. #DeploySanctions

4032 2018-03-01 16:05:06 That moment when you’re waiting on an oil change and listen to a grown man sniffle and snort over and over again.  BLOW YOUR NOSE!  #StopBeingNasty #ItsElementary
4033 2018-03-01 16:05:06 No no No, what hit spending was the FX crisis. Not Oil, not TSA. Not only did it make things more expensive and scarce, it also forced many companies to shut down

4040 2018-03-01 16:03:55 No monopoly on foreign trade, for a better functioning capitalism not for its eclipsing, public ownership and state planning is not dominant - oil fund sort of skews thing, could also say dominant mode of production is not for use value (and no plans to moving towards that),
4041 2018-03-01 16:03:44 Noo, oil painting takes months and months to complete  and thats when i lose my interest in completing it.

4047 2018-03-01 16:03:15 Energy costs are rising but there's always a lag time. These miners could not stop the bleeding when oil was $45 & gold was 12 something. Some of the majors were at 2001 lows in 2015 and 16

4103 2018-03-01 15:57:16 Well I’m out of ideas... I’m guessing that the cats run because those family members never properly oil their weapons... so the mechanisms are always loud and screechy.

4108 2018-03-01 15:56:30 Maybe they can be retrained to harvest whale oil. Times change
4109 2018-03-01 15:56:03 Brits took down ottoman empire they had already looted silk road fortunes, negated future wealth by colonising spice islands in Asia & gold trail to Africa. Then they found oil. I guess if they simply said "were here for looting" rather than "protecting the civilians"...
4110 2018-03-01 15:55:55 Probably doesn't help that Regime Autocrats are giving huge oil 'over-see' bonuses to Loyalists (ineffective at running oil production)...  while the rest suffer equal starvation... #Socialism.  #sad.
4111 2018-03-01 15:55:49 Despite this limit, human ingenuity and tech keep finding new resources, new uses for under-utlilised resources, and ways to conserve them. Think of illumination: from wax and tallow candles to whale oil to kerosine to electricity. Light bulb evolves from incandescent to LED.
4112 2018-03-01 15:55:45 DOG. I had the brougham and put the radio and speakers in, used to do the brakes, carburetor, all that shit. only thing I didn't do was oil and fluids cuz I never knew where to dispose of em and I follow directions.

4114 2018-03-01 15:55:23 it was not a question of who... it is a situation of the prevailing economic realities... Price of oil was falling and for a country dependent on oil, it was doom waiting to happen... Buhari was just the unlucky driver...

4116 2018-03-01 15:55:04 Easy and tasty things to try: Chop up an onion, a red pepper and a portobello mushroom and put them in a container. This'll last you a week or so. Then for breakfast, mist some olive oil on a pan and heat it up. Put some of your mix on there for a few minutes. (cont)

4118 2018-03-01 15:55:03 Strangely enough, when Mike offered his "anti peak oil production"  ideas free to the media for more than 20 years, very few were interested, although he was proven time after time to be correct.  Probably the idea of "free idea" is not a good marketing strategy?!
4119 2018-03-01 15:54:59 Kroger has only owned Fred Meyer for a few years. I’m originally from Ohio and one day I noticed them selling Big K soda and I asked the manager to confirm that’s what happened.

4139 2018-03-01 15:52:17 Actually a shop called MITTS belonging to minister Thoriq is possibly behind this oil smuggling. We can ask BASF international company if Thoriq & MITTS involved in this illegal oil trade to North Korea
4140 2018-03-01 15:51:48 Because I reject your interpretation of history. There were no direct subsidies needed to encourage people to use hydro, coal, oil, or natural gas. All of those fuels met customer needs better than other alternatives. Fed money in hydro for jobs during Depression

4164 2018-03-01 15:49:11 Good point Pete. I'd also like to note that groundwork for strategic overseas shipments of crude oil exports was passed by a Rep.controlled Congress & signed by President Obama (according to Bus. Insider). My tongue in cheek was in response to Ben's usual "blame Pres. Obama".

4172 2018-03-01 15:48:28 The mostly foreign owned oil companies pour billions into brain washing campaigns to convince Canadians that oil spills are OK and to delay on global warming mitigation.  Then they point at the volunteers of the heart who fund raise via philanthropist and cry like a baby.
4173 2018-03-01 15:48:24 Can we achieve Canadian climate goals by making the oil sands cleaner? Oil will still be burnt.

4205 2018-03-01 15:46:51 However, the government here depends too much on the price of oil for its budget, and we badly need to get consumer revenue to be on an equal playing field with every other jurisdiction in Canada.  9.1 billion in the hole is better than 10.5 billion but we have a ways to go yet.

4221 2018-03-01 15:45:26 Too bad the conservatives didn’t save any of those oil/gas billions for rainy days. Thankfully the NDP are investing and creating jobs in places other than oil and gas. Unfortunate that conservative governments did nothing to protect workers from constant boom/busy cycles.

4250 2018-03-01 15:42:43 I think American sanctions and a drop in oil prices came as a violent shock to their otherwise fragile economy. Better examples of socialism in Finland, Denmark, NZ, Canada, Paraguay, Uraguay & China.

4273 2018-03-01 15:40:47 Not the faintest idea. You'd have to be Putin to know for sure.

4286 2018-03-01 15:40:10 (follow on from last post) ... while renewables are insufficent and the technology keeps improving it might be wise to look at shale gas as a temporary solution that could save the country a lot of money from oil imports that fund not so nice regimes.
4287 2018-03-01 15:39:59 Why is this against fisheries? You realize that the US ships tons of oil down our coast already? Check ship trackers and see the traffic.

4297 2018-03-01 15:39:27 "Crude oil production hit record high"
What an amazing confluence of coincidence! This country is truly incredible...For the record high production of oil is being matched with a record high production of crude political humor!!
4298 2018-03-01 15:39:10 I put some face oil on my beauty blender because it was making me flaky without, not realizing that this is how the blender should be used...smh. #beauty #makeup #beautyblender #faceoil

4300 2018-03-01 15:39:05 Only evaluate cos with major core positions so that argument doesn't work. I show data, you say "Come on" but show no data. I've have been a geologist in the oil and gas business for 40 years. If a field isn't profitable in 1st ~3 yrs, it rarely gets there.
4301 2018-03-01 15:38:57 i think i prefer Kurdish to Turkish (ottoman) which is mainly vegetables in oil :( i also think it's very similar to Lebanese food, my all time favorite food.
4302 2018-03-01 15:38:52 We ruined Russia  oil prices with the pipeline... which her and Obama were protecting for years..this is transference!!

4304 2018-03-01 15:38:44 #TIILWMV Brent $80 by 2Q18 and $100 by 3Q18 #OOTT 1. OPEC production/exports low; 2. US production growth limited by labor; 3. Higher rates to limit capital availability; 4. Oil demand grows until recession; 5. EV production limited until 2025+; 6. Offshore/Venezuela sink at $70.
4305 2018-03-01 15:38:44 What is the better idea sell it to cheap to the US or to ship it by rail? The oil is coming out of the ground we prosper from it.

4312 2018-03-01 15:37:41 @KarlEggerss Interesting to note the price action in oil and the price of oil stocks and ETF's. Oil down ~2% and stocks/ETF's solidly in the green.
4313 2018-03-01 15:37:32 You do understand that BC has plenty of oil and gas production and has leaker rules around protection right?
4314 2018-03-01 15:37:23 You rather oil change or blown gasket! Put $10 away every two weeks for the oil change 
4315 2018-03-01 15:37:14 Jim Rogers a moron you say Lolol away and do some research as your obviously lacking  councillor  btw Scottish waters Scottish oil!  Fact.
4316 2018-03-01 15:36:53 How about asking the 500,000 BC Pension Corp plan holders about the two pipeline and two oil sands companies in their top 25 holdings? Do half million BCers want their pensions compromised by NDP antics?

4319 2018-03-01 15:36:16 $WTI flirting with $60 on a nice 2.2% down move. Need oil to collapse back to $50s. Holding the short and would actually like to add to $BP lower on the long term side.

4334 2018-03-01 15:35:10 If this worked as advertised, every single oil company on the planet would be trying to outbid each other for co-production rights, and govs chomping at the bit for the tax royalties.  No more exploration costs, no more remediation costs, and no threat of a future pollution tax.

4359 2018-03-01 15:32:39 Further more; Trump has freed domestic energy resource exploration. 
Secured keystone pipeline bringing oil from Canada not Russia.
These moves negate any benefit Russia would have from the absence of sanctions.

Mess up the land and destroy the aquifer and poor people will still live there. They shouldn't have to have tap water that you can light on fire but they do.

In Nigeria, 13% of oil revenue goes to local communities. (That has not stopped attacks on oil installations by those wanting more.) The rest is shared out among the 3 tiers of the Nigerian government; the federal branch gets 52%
4425 2018-03-01 15:25:37 Thank god for hot water bottles and portable heaters. My oil is frozen and heating isn’t working 
4426 2018-03-01 15:25:28 The advancement in fracking technology/innovation opened up huge tight oil reserves that were previously uneconomical in Texas, hence massive productionboom in last 10 year. Also have 1. ocean coast 2.population size of Canada, and surrounded by populated states also size of CDN.
4427 2018-03-01 15:25:26 That's like asking all Christians to rise up and kick out extremists from Christianity (or Jews). I recommend you read about the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia, an extremist cult that got lucky with oil. Incidentally,the US tends to bomb countries where extremism is contained.
4428 2018-03-01 15:25:18 Yeah but I wouldn't consider oil to be not government controlled what do you think OPEC is?
4429 2018-03-01 15:25:16 To be fair, their probably all busy shoveling snow and topping up the oil tank today given their love for #equality

4436 2018-03-01 15:24:33 At almost 52 I have lived through the results of 3rd party voting and its ugly reprecusions. 2000 and Naderites created George W, and the chance to actually face Climate Change head on, increase funding for non, oil based energy impossible, and millions of innocent peoples deaths
4437 2018-03-01 15:24:30 Well they got the price of oil up to 65 dollars and Russia is making out really well while we are paying for it.
4438 2018-03-01 15:24:26 @boilerjuice What a joke. Bad service. No oil delivered on the date they promised. They never call you back. BAD BAD BAD.

4440 2018-03-01 15:24:21 Don't know about Putin's little black book of horrors. 

All I know is that volatile oil prices are here to stay and that a lot can send them tumbling down.

O&G revenue fed Putin's slush fund. Now it's empty and there's no $100/barrel in sight to fill it. So Putin is .

4464 2018-03-01 15:21:44 I think it has more to do with people forgetting that the first rain is the most dangerous because it releases all the oil and grime from the road's "pores" making it more slick than what it would be with water alone.

4512 2018-03-01 15:17:31 Need some clarity on this, do you mean the production of getting the gas has a carbon footprint as bas as coal or do you mean when the gas itself is burned? As far as i am aware when burnt the emissions of shale gas are far less than oil. I'll link a source to that.

4547 2018-03-01 15:14:32 I get the impression that they are looking at 14,15 as they like the gas/oil ratio which should give a much higher oil flow rate.

4550 2018-03-01 15:14:18 You prolly already know this but make sure they put the dipstick back in, check your oil a couple of times afterward to make sure they filled it right/didn’t overfill and tightened the oil drain plug enough, etc

Rationing starts and the gov’t takes over things like fuel production and pipeline logistics. Oil exports will cease & ppl who r in those businesses will sue the government. It’s WILL happen

4618 2018-03-01 15:06:56 @RealAlanRoth it's not controversial because JT and Butts welcome it because it's helping their real agenda which is the elimination of oil completely from our economy they haven't got the guts to say their real intentions so they love it when other zealots do it for them

4673 2018-03-01 15:02:04 but fuel (oil) is found far beneath the fossil layer. so "fossil fuel" is already an un-scientific term.
i am all about #geothermal power, however & maybe this can reduce our carbon footprint without government mandates.

& my damn good reasons are "keep it local" "keep it cheap"

Me: *Googles how to kill CW with essential oil*
4675 2018-03-01 15:01:57 Renewable energy is a growing concept. Why is solar so costly when it could be reduced. Reduction there would result in a reduction in oil cost which reduces the import bill long term #beproactive

4707 2018-03-01 14:59:23 Heating oil is frozen solid = no central heating... and it’s -4 degrees outside, with snow drifts as high as 8 feet piling up. I have had to wrap myself in five layers of blankets to feel my hands again 
4708 2018-03-01 14:59:22 people freaking out that their water bottle or bike helmet are made by a company owned by a company that owns a company that makes guns are gonna lose their minds when they learn anything about oil, gas & plastic.
4709 2018-03-01 14:59:20 OIL 15min chart volatiliity OFF, momentum lower signals halt, RSI 25 and oversold.
4710 2018-03-01 14:59:17 @TomFitton You can pretend all you want to be an authority on how our government should be run, in reality you’re just selling snake oil on the internet.  Backed by Russian trolls and trying hard to destabilize our democracy. #JunkWatch #LiarsLie #BadFantasyFiction
4711 2018-03-01 14:59:14 I gave up gum (and coffee) so I drink water with peppermint essential oil. It helps to wake me up too.
4712 2018-03-01 14:59:12 The east coast of Canada is freezing and my house has oil heat

4716 2018-03-01 14:58:42 I can't think of the name but I know there's an oil that you can brush on your nails that make them taste terrible so you stop biting altogether.

4727 2018-03-01 14:58:05 Devendra ji, congrats for such krantikaari steps.
We, being one of the pioneers to bring "successful" Solarisation of Petrol Pumps with Ind Oil, would like to play, atleast design, Engineering and commissioning of some initial Cold Rooms. Yr guidance may be helpful, sir!
4728 2018-03-01 14:57:56 Syria has alot of oil..ISIL which operated mostly with US made weapons used to sell more than $1B  worth of oil through turkey. Some media reports alleged it was bought by erdogans family in turkey. Russia came for the oil too and other benefits..they arm gvt and us arm rebels
4729 2018-03-01 14:57:52 So we still have chicken hawks? The big mouthed idiot Bolton ought to look around. We haven't won a war lately. As a matter of fact, we're still losing in Afghanistan and in our botched oil grab in Iraq.

4731 2018-03-01 14:57:36 You and @AlexSalmond weren't any good in predicting the oil price was you sweetheart. I take all figures predicting future economic events and polls with a large pinch of salt. You would be wise to do too.

4738 2018-03-01 14:57:10 Don't need or want the dozen or so dirty oil jobs that your pipeline would create. Fully support BCNDP and Greens to do whatever it takes to kill this inevitable catastrophic disaster to our planet.
4739 2018-03-01 14:57:08 Subsidiaries- look it up.
4740 2018-03-01 14:57:02 In 22 years time, nobody in Europe or even America would be interested in buying Nigeria's crude oil. By 2040 no car in Europe would run on fossil fuel. Electric cars would be ruling the world then. What'd happen to our economy? @NGRPresident @ProfOsinbajo @bukolasaraki
4741 2018-03-01 14:56:59 Aye mate, i can get it for 20 bar a time but dont like Vapes. The real oil that can be applied to Rizlas like 80s India shit now that was smoke.

No now
4745 2018-03-01 14:56:29 Received a poorly lit, painfully loud snap from Francis, who tells me between sobs he's at the bottom of an oil reserve about to have his dick drilled off!
4746 2018-03-01 14:56:18 On your LT oil view- any particular stock picks you really like in the E&P space? Still those 5? Im long RIG, PMO (UK) and SWN at the moment - but interested in any ideas you might have that I can research? thx
4747 2018-03-01 14:56:14 Life hack: If you get your oil changed first thing in the morning, it only takes 20-30 minutes instead of 1- 1.5 hours.

4755 2018-03-01 14:55:29 I'm just imagining how much soap it would take to scrub the remaining oil off 
4756 2018-03-01 14:55:25 You fool.  Scottish oil is worthless and unsaleable.
4757 2018-03-01 14:55:20 Just read this:

"The province’s job market, hit hard by the 3-year oil industry downturn, by December had recovered all the headcount lost during the recession"

4781 2018-03-01 14:53:02 I would say you are wrong and dangerously so. You will see how it pans out when climate crisis, wars over resources (Syrian oil and gas, guess who is occupying territory there), growing inequality, growing health crisis, anxiety,  stress related illness,  and more. Enjoy.
4782 2018-03-01 14:53:00 Thanks! Do you use the prep or argon oil?

4784 2018-03-01 14:52:50 Was wondering the same when I heard about an oil backed crypto... what next, a gold standard?! Ironic how it took high tech innovation to incentivize the state to reconsider backing our fiat!

4789 2018-03-01 14:52:14 Even if you could transport oil without the possibility of a spil, the end result is still the burning of fossil fuels, which hurts the environment.
4790 2018-03-01 14:51:58 well as far as we know there was never life on mars to create oil so better figure something else out if having spaceships traveling to and fro is the plan.
4791 2018-03-01 14:51:51 So far today: put clean dishes away, washed dishes, made coffee and lunch for sweetheart, smoothies, fed pups and took them out, two 5 minute pick ups, made beds, water 1, filled & turned on my oil diffuser. Next up: make a plan, start laundry, dreaded phone call.

4810 2018-03-01 14:49:26 Yes

I was in Flood of 93 Saint Louis.
We should have a project near any major River that grabs and uses that excess water.
We pipleline oil and we can't do the same with h2o

Energy also. I followed a stock that made the batteries for towns to storage. BK like Solyndra.
4811 2018-03-01 14:49:22 Not coincidentally, the GOP has (literally) "taken aim" at our National Emblem as a result of their COLLUSION with a different faction: the Oil & Gas Industry. 

What is most chilling is that the SAME TOXIC POLLUTION "killing the birds" is being "absorbed by U.S. CHILDREN."

4823 2018-03-01 14:47:46 If you don't see it by now, you never will. Hope you enjoy higher taxes, because that's what Trudeau's policies require. With oil industry slammed, oil prices hit by hefty discounts and NAFTA in question, you must believe in a magic money tree, somewhere.

4835 2018-03-01 14:46:19 I promise, the one I buy tastes just like butter. You can make mashed potatoes with it and you would never know the difference. I tried a basil-infused olive oil, and a quince pomegranate vinegar; it was like drinking a cocktail. So good.

4856 2018-03-01 14:44:13 Cui bono. Research the history of lead in gasoline. It was “proven” to have no side effect. The oil companies paid for research and skewed results. It was 20 years after to ban and prove the oil companies covered it up. You know the damage now that lead can cause...

4859 2018-03-01 14:43:37 That is the silliest headline ever. 
It is a fact , that it has always been part of our national power plans that in times of extreme bad weather some companies who are heavy users of gas have there power supply restricted . They then use their own generators powered by oil.

4864 2018-03-01 14:43:03 Well in today's day and age. Scientific data can be fudged with big money. One fine example is the impact of leaded gasoline. Big oil bought scientists that said lead wasn't harmful. Yet it was finally proven to be a lie.

4897 2018-03-01 14:39:02 Plastic can harm the environment as it non biodegradable and the production of plastic will release greenhouse gases such as CO2. Drecrese the dependence  on oil can expand the time for us to use and reduce greenhouse gases emission.
4898 2018-03-01 14:38:57 @amacattackkk just placed my order with Shea Shea Bakery...im excited. I got the scar healing oil, lip scrub and raw African soap.
4899 2018-03-01 14:38:56 As plastic are products of fossil fuel, banning the plastic can decrease the consumption and dependence on oil. This is good as both of the do harm to the environment.
4900 2018-03-01 14:38:35 Thanks for the article. We need to diversify away from oil & gas dependancy. The #AlbertaDisadvantage is plaguing Our economy. The U.S leaders are watching us argue over these resources while renogotiating NAFTA. The u.s. demand is the problem. #ClimateAction

4982 2018-03-01 14:29:52 Bcos our economy is based on crude oil, the beneficiaries of crude oil will definitely become poor when their price of crude oil falls or when they can't extract it any more. poor Nigerian farmers don't share from the proceeds of the oil. So, the poverty criers  can wait for oil.
4983 2018-03-01 14:29:52 A wee trick I learned about using the curry style spices is that I use sundried toms , and a little of the oil from it , fried off and added - also helps to drop one of the heavy salted cubes if you need to lower salt.

Big time fan of pepper instead of salt noo

4987 2018-03-01 14:29:42 Definitely. Though again, without attributing any moral weight to this analytical benchmark, it just reinforces how low the market clearing wage for teachers is in many contexts (e.g., oil, groundnuts and an odd handful of notes).

4994 2018-03-01 14:29:08 Blimey, I feel for my brother who lives in a seriously cold old cottage flat. Our aga has gone out, we've no oil, so relying on electric shower (which is rubbish) tomorrow morning, and the woodburner. Our lodgers next door are going to be cold as they only have their aga/heating

5027 2018-03-01 14:25:44 Also important to remember informal economy, esp in rural #SSA. Not all teachers receive 'wages' as such. e.g. contract teachers in rural Sierra Leone may receive in-kind contributions (oil, ground nuts) from local communities, & odd handful of notes if/when farmers have cash

5074 2018-03-01 14:21:11 Crude oil is 15% of Canadian exports...you will not stop that without severe economic consequences. Transition to a carbon-free economy requires investment capital. Only an incremental approach will work. Get behind the pipeline and free up rail cars for Saskatchewan grain.

5132 2018-03-01 14:14:23 Karena katanya si olive oil anti bacterial. Entahlah mungkin ini yg bikin hr ke 5 rambut gak ada ketombe etc. Plus naik gojek selalu tutup rapet

5173 2018-03-01 14:09:19 US crude production is ALWAYS down in December as 31 Dec is the assessment date for taxes on crude oil stocks, also refineries slow down for the same reason
5174 2018-03-01 14:09:15 The US made a deal with the devil back in 1974. If we don't give that brutal country everything it wants, they will stop selling oil in dollars. That would set an example for other oil producers to do the same. We can't go to war with all of them.

5183 2018-03-01 14:08:41 Oil companies also invest in supressing technology that would replace thier oil business. They buy the pattents then shelve them so no one can use the tech to beat them in a true capitalisitic way.

5219 2018-03-01 14:05:19 I think, being neither an economist nor fund manager, the issue here would be that capital is finite -- if Canadian $ is buying up oil assets, that may be good for that particular deal but it means that money can't do something else. 
Less $ in ecosystem tends to = slower growth.
5220 2018-03-01 14:05:11 Yeah arrived in SA in 2014/2015 when they bought Drakensburg oil and Brent Oil. They been growing ever since. Opened a petrol station in Melville a few years ago. And now they are along the N3 between jhb and dbn.

5269 2018-03-01 14:00:24 In the 70's, it was to be independent of the Gulf countries putting pressure on oil prices. There was a better reason than just succumbing to pressure. The States, up to recently, was completely dependent on Saudis, etc... (hence Bush's invasion of Irak and its 100,000's dead)...
5270 2018-03-01 14:00:16 Apr crude oil (CLJ18 -0.76%) this morning is down -45 cents (-0.73%) and Apr gasoline (RBJ18 -0.65%) is -0.0116 (-0.60%).
5271 2018-03-01 14:00:10 @ashmcghee Sale of Snowy demonstrates beyond doubt #GladysB not interested in renewable energy. "Productive" infrastructure is most likely road tunnels or freeways. The asset swap deals and monopoly games continue until a physical oil shortage brings everything to an end

5278 2018-03-01 13:59:40 Yes, there are plenty of reasons to be upbeat. The economy is really on a high trajectory, thanks to 7.2% GDP growth in the third quarter of 2017-18. Much of the credit for this should go to core sectors such like oil and gas.
5279 2018-03-01 13:59:38 It definitely is a factor. But below a certain price for barrels of oil equivalent - and gas prices are very low - these are still complex projects to operate. 

Thanks for a great perspective. Certainly sheds more light on what I know.

5546 2018-03-01 13:28:22 Just looked on the BBFC site: Oil, Boring and Flood were all classified on 9/9/88. So if there was an earlier release, it was unrated...was that still possible in '84?

5617 2018-03-01 13:21:09 It wasn’t that long ago that we surrendered energy production to Mexico and Canada and were told American production was impossible. Now with shale oil we are in command of the entire oil market with incremental crude production. Seems like all is not what we’ve been told.

5619 2018-03-01 13:20:33 Saudi's are smart in realising that the world is moving away from oil. Soon the dependence on Saudi in terms of Oil will keep on decreasing. They need to stand on a global stage besides their identity of oil giant. This will bring foreign investments in other sectors besides oil.

5679 2018-03-01 13:14:26 I put oil in my car (by myself) this morning so I’m not sure what I else I could do to make this day any more productive.

5684 2018-03-01 13:13:19 It's interesting that Oil/Boring/Flood were chosen, possibly because they were light on bands (they'd only have had to clear Madness, who they were mates with).

But then again, the video had loads of music cuts anyway.

5693 2018-03-01 13:12:10 See what socialism and a dictator did to this previously oil rich country?
5694 2018-03-01 13:12:02 Try this oil. My whole face used to be dry, my mouth area, my cheeks, around my eyes, my forehead. I used this oil and it fixed my skin within a week. Also, try not to use any acne preventing products, because this usually contains salicylic acid, which dried out my skin a ton.
5695 2018-03-01 13:12:00 cannabis oil??? srsly???
5696 2018-03-01 13:11:37 Excellent Truth:-

In a theatre when #drama plays, ..you opt for front seats. When #film is screened, ..you opt for rear seats.Your position in life is only relative.Not absolute.   For making soap,oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required.
5697 2018-03-01 13:11:35 Many  countries or ANY nation, especially smaller than America , economically rely on ONE incredible economic resource- ex. Oil .  THERE lie the wealth of a one economy nation , far different than a multi- fed economy . Other words; If your country is rich - then you are .
5698 2018-03-01 13:11:35 You would need to read what happened to all the oil money and where it went. You would also need to understand that WM deliberately fails to invest in infrastructure pretty much anywhere North, West of the Watford Gap. Since SNP took over, we're catching up

5706 2018-03-01 13:10:37 Really? That might explain how they got them to redub the opening to Oil; I thought it was strange that they managed to reassemble them in '88 just to do a few lines.

5711 2018-03-01 13:10:03 えっ
5712 2018-03-01 13:09:59 Yes but far more likely to be other commercial users. Again, don't worry. We've no oil generating capacity now either. There is a considerable amount of reserve and other toys to play with if need be. You can even drop voltage to reduce demand. No need to worry.
5713 2018-03-01 13:09:56 Hey @CertasBusiness my elderly parents are still waiting on a delivery they ordered on 23rd Feb, & their heating oil has nearly run out... how much longer do they have to wait?

5747 2018-03-01 13:04:21 They do it because these industrial and commercial customers have cheap gas on  ‘Interruptible Contracts’ and are supposed to have an alternative fuel available, usually oil, to fire their equipment. This has been common practice in the gas industry for over 40 years.
5748 2018-03-01 13:04:12 Jason was busy spraying vegetable oil at the sky to protect himself against the chemtrails, so he probably didn't notice.

5754 2018-03-01 13:03:56 @realDonaldTrump Sanctions will have limited effect on Russia until oil price will be more than $50. And US need low oil price. Involvement on Middle East wars and bad US relations with KSA increase oil price. Offer control of oil market to KSA.

5774 2018-03-01 13:01:28 what people keep forgetting is that we rely on oil to earn foreign exchange and when it runs out ofter 2020  we will be broke.
5775 2018-03-01 13:01:22 Ultimately, here you have the potential to reduce the stress to our limited natural resources (coming from oil or using arable land and water as input) or basically promote something that transfers problems & does not solve the fact that it is short-lived, thus designed for trash

5838 2018-03-01 12:53:50 Just reading through some of the testimonials in the CBD Oil Group

5841 2018-03-01 12:53:25 @realDonaldTrump government officials owned by Russia, Putin, NRA and big oil. Not making America great!
5842 2018-03-01 12:53:15 Yep, Australia is pretty good at offshore oil and gas, no reason why we couldn’t turn to offshore wind as well.
5843 2018-03-01 12:53:12 This speech was for domestic consumption ahead of elections. Russians want to believe their military is strengthening and developing new assets to confront the west. Sanctions, oil prices and economic mismanagement are not helping make this a reality.

5853 2018-03-01 12:51:36 That's generally the case, my impression is that the increased efficiency of Turkey red oil decreased the need for tannins as an assistant. There aren't actually any recipes in the GU UTR collection, all mine were external!

5860 2018-03-01 12:50:45 American exceptionalism is a belief that we are indoctrinated into very young. The idea that we are the “best” is constantly pushed in American entertainment and news media. It’s really to keep us here to oil the machine and to motivate us to do awful things.

5869 2018-03-01 12:50:22 Where are they getting the money for this?  It was just in 2016, their treasury was saying they were going broke. The oil sanctions had caused a recession in that country.

5898 2018-03-01 12:47:07 That article talks about restricting Cali leases - a much more direct route. And given the even higher GHG/bbl of CA oil this could ultimately have a reasonable cost/tonne abated (again, depending on elasticity of replacement supply)

5959 2018-03-01 12:38:06 The sabotage (2002-2003) was notoriously orchestrated by opposition forces funded by the US and forced Venezuela (the largest reserve in the world) to import oil. Losses were about 15 billion dollars and the goal was to create an economic collapse and remove Chavez

5961 2018-03-01 12:37:41 Cliniques clarifying lotion is good, they have one for oily skin and also one for acne prone skin, I use those to tone.  But I have also had good luck with witch hazel, I just put some tea tree oil and lemon oil in it.

5994 2018-03-01 12:31:18 My perfume of the day is a drop of lavender oil on my cardigan and I received more compliments today than I normally do when I wear my usual perfume!!!!
5995 2018-03-01 12:31:15 That isn’t quite right. We are burning coal oil and gas at a much much faster rate than it was stored as fossil fuel. That is why CO2 went from under 300 to over 400 ppm. No, plugging a few volcanos wouldn’t do it even if possible . All volcanos produce much less than humans do
5996 2018-03-01 12:31:12 Snow dAys are shit. Yesterday was fun. Today is just pissing freezing. My roof falling apart and my oil delivery couldn't get down the drive

6005 2018-03-01 12:29:52 How's that promise to Dave coal jobs doing? Didn't you let a bunch of Russian steel into country to finish off oil pipeline.
6006 2018-03-01 12:29:37 This is the guy who should have pleaded with Bush not to drag us into your Middle East oil problems instead of creeping up his arse.
6007 2018-03-01 12:29:26 Doesn’t this mean wti is consistently undervalued due to shale oil fear?  Quality not quantity actually means something.  Shale oil is mostly garbage, high rvp, low distillate yield and almost no reforming value.  Can anyone prove me wrong?
6008 2018-03-01 12:29:17 with$500m Ajaokuta company will be 100% completed n operational. But FG is spending Billions of $ searching for oil in Lake chad
6009 2018-03-01 12:29:11 Canada DOES stand up for oil/pipelines, etc. You realize that the Liberal government got some approved (the previous Con government couldn't) but not Canada's fault that oil companies determined oil sands extraction too costly to profit with current world market prices?
6010 2018-03-01 12:29:09 Good for your love. I hope this new cleanser will work fr me decide to wait fr two weeks la and see how. I used HL oil cleanser too btw. Nice of you sharing the tips and info 
6011 2018-03-01 12:29:09 Just read a great article from @PopMech which has a lot of information on #Fracking, emissions given off from burning natural gas are far lower than oil so i was correct in a way but not in the application i applied it, shale gas > oil for environment seems plausible

6020 2018-03-01 12:26:18 Yeah, that should have been ok then. I usually make sure the potatos are quite dry once I’ve pealed them, and then toss them in a little bit of olive oil before I put them in the fryer.
6021 2018-03-01 12:26:14 President Putin wants general cases of company functioning & determined oil budget. It can be said there are chances of total investment in services sector in Russia. @CNBC @FoxBusiness
6022 2018-03-01 12:26:13 Not bad! Try using a pre-shave oil next time - it will help to soften the hair more and lubricate the skin a little better. It should reduce the redness! Grab an alum block for those little cuts too!

6024 2018-03-01 12:25:54 It's one argument to regularise medical cannabis oil via prescription, but altering the cost benefit ratio for dealers with very long sentences is a better move than legalisation.
6025 2018-03-01 12:25:41 I’m so grateful for marijuana and the fact that it’s legal in NV- it helps when I have anxiety. I use THC oil to ease my menestral cramps. It’s affordable than most medication and pain relief. I don’t know what I’d without it.
6026 2018-03-01 12:25:32 my water is fiji, my oil is tea tree
6027 2018-03-01 12:25:29 Don't try coconut oil if you're acne prone, it's comedogenic &it will probably clog your pores.  Rosehip seed oil, vitamin e, helichyrsm oil, and vitamin c serums are all good for acne scars.  I've also had luck w/African black soap but that varies person to person bc it's drying

6093 2018-03-01 12:16:53 Scotland has been a net contributor to the U.K. Labour and Tories have created debt mainly to keep city of London afloat. Why should Scotland have to pay for that, especially when our oil paid for most of your infrastructure!
6094 2018-03-01 12:16:13 "Solar dimming" from "solar radiation management" or spewing aerosolized particulate in stratosphere per Dr Keith, Harvard, is def useful to Big Oil and Big Gas as they get 20 years more w/fake cooling to use up fossil fuels, slow people clamoring for sustainable energy policy.

6098 2018-03-01 12:15:40 Well it's true. Very few came to ND untill the oil boom. I love ND. But it's like anywhere else. One just has to live here to appreciate it. And one has to leave here and experience the world. Not too much of that either.

6161 2018-03-01 12:06:04 What I do not get is why the US has not air dropped food to the Venezuelan people. We get your nation has a shit ton of oil, and your cryptocurrency will be used for the purchase of oil, but what about the people!?

Con: Was really oily and is now super stiff

Pro: My hair smells like coconuts
6247 2018-03-01 11:54:44 It's the best!, get the dual phase oil, and the exfoliator and moisturiser ! X

6255 2018-03-01 11:52:55 1. PRC interest in IOR stem from the fact 80% of their oil imports are through IO. If our navy dominates IOR it can impact PrC. Hence the bases. 2. We are 25 years in our mindset compared to PRC 3. We lack a cohesive national security strategy hence land up arming without aiming.

6262 2018-03-01 11:51:51 of course honey, just go lay down and i’ll bring you some tea. you should use the lavender or jasmine oil
6263 2018-03-01 11:51:50 Why?  Research is still being done and the theory holds up.  Big energy tends to lobby against it but there is more than a little vested interest there.  We have to push into new energy sources - oil and gas won't last for ever and we are short of precious metals.
6264 2018-03-01 11:51:42 Oil money ? 
6265 2018-03-01 11:51:39 It may take a few years, but so does building a bridge!  Do you think Norway with its Trillion £ oil fund sits there thinking “we shouldn’t have done that it took 40 years!”  At least @theSNP are trying to improve Scotland and it must stick in you guys craw!

6283 2018-03-01 11:48:07 Yes, a purely theoretical or mathematical construct. Like hyperinflation, where the price level, for a time, follows an explosive path but never goes on forever. BTW hyperinflation is one way to cure very large debt. Like putting out an oil well fire with dynamite?

6410 2018-03-01 11:23:01 Seems to me ME have done quite nicely from our oil dependency. How the money then is distributed is another issue.
6411 2018-03-01 11:22:47 In a world there is increasing concern that our bodies are being 'fed' with chemicals, it is reassuring - as well as unexpected - to learn that no chemicals or solvents are used  in the extraction of palm oil.

6460 2018-03-01 11:14:18 As always, a helpful report! It would seem that we also need to consider the portions of extra virgin olive oil in the Mediterranean diet which may not be as heavy handed as in many American kitchens.

6490 2018-03-01 11:07:31 Well you obviously did not read (or possibly understand?) the economic case for independence. Oil is a BONUS not a necessity. How often do we have to say that?!

•Trump has given freedom to drill wherever we need and Russia’s economy has been hurt badly
6727 2018-03-01 10:23:38 America now the leader in oil production, so it means it needs to be the leader in oil marketing.

6809 2018-03-01 10:08:58 I reckon Donald handed him the position to help foster trade with Russia & other oil producing nations. 

Because, how else in the world is the CEO of ExxonMobil (with no prior diplomatic experience) supposed to be effective re: other crucial issues facing the world & country.

6880 2018-03-01 09:55:40 It's the same with solar power. The Tories cut subsidies for solar panel installation, which was really because they are supported by the oil industry. Even without the subsidies we should invest in solar, wind and water power.

7107 2018-03-01 09:09:12 @Boilerjuice really not impressed . I ordered my oil two weeks ago and just yesterday was told the snow is preventimg my delivery.  It's -6° and I'm turning off my heating to conserve what little oil I have left and btw your customer service team isn't answering calls!!!
7108 2018-03-01 09:09:09 So cool!! They should pool their money to create a solar panel plant. Then hire all their oil coworkers for safer work at higher pay, while the lottery winners make millions more in return.  #WinWin
7109 2018-03-01 09:08:49 I do believe they have the odd drop of oil.Try getting a hotel room in Stavamger.
7110 2018-03-01 09:08:46 Eh? England manufactures practically no finished goods. All her major brands are foreign owned. She is 2 trillion in debt with an economy based on dodgy financial services.  Every Englishman should be thanking Scots for all the lovely oil, whisky and high-tech revenues.#UrWelcome
7111 2018-03-01 09:08:41 @afneil RT @enappsys: Bit a contrarian view, but given the situation 4 gas + its impact on power today you wonder if there is a case for keeping some coal open not to run, but to provide a source of emergency power (like oil is used in some European countries)? #diversification
7112 2018-03-01 09:08:32 Cannabis oil distillery running in a tower block? Yeah, the cladding was definitely the main issue here.

7134 2018-03-01 09:04:04 There's a good argument that having people employed is cheaper than paying them welfare though, don't you think? Another issue might be the likelihood of increasing future fuel costs for imported goods, against having no British-produced alternatives left. Oil IS running out.

7580 2018-03-01 07:33:58 Rise in supply can lead to a surplus, ie, too much oil available. This means that prices could fall if inventories rise too high. Too much supply.

There must be clear balance between supply and demand. Supply rises to high with little demand and prices will fall.

7588 2018-03-01 07:31:53 Alberta needs to shut off the oil to BC for 2-3 weeks and watch the price go to $3/l. That would put pressure on their gov to relent on pipelines.

7668 2018-03-01 07:15:04 I'm a parent. I agree with you about the ABA/PBS behaviour modification techniques. None of us are perfect and those snake oil salesmen are so damned persuasive, they use every trick in the book, inc guilt tripping us into buying into their schemes. Please keep raising awareness.

7943 2018-03-01 06:26:11 For China, International trade with everyone is a priority. Anything that jeopardizes trade with USA will be done in secrecy. So China would not just "open the tap" n sell oil to DPRK. I'm pretty sure GoM couldn't do oil trade with DPRK without China's Knowledge.
7944 2018-03-01 06:25:56 Why did your father’s government pay a $10 million release clause to @GrantThornton to stop an on going audit investigation into Yameen’s illegal STO oil trade with Burmese Junta? The similarities with both these cases are uncanny
7945 2018-03-01 06:25:54 I used left over rice and put some vegetable oil and soy sauce, eggs, sausages, dried seaweed AT 1:2AM and drank like 4 cups of water I WILL NOT SLEEP at this point. And I had 2 bites of tres leches :-(

7947 2018-03-01 06:25:39 Also tell them to help out their gut biome with fermented foods. I just got bottles of krill oil today which has 48 times the antioxidants of fish oil, omega 3s and no fishy taste. That could help lots too.
7948 2018-03-01 06:25:34 Last I checked, oil isn't scared of SHIT. They ruined an ocean for a couple years and got a slap on the wrist. O.o;

7971 2018-03-01 06:22:32 Yes! I know it seems crazy but it exfoliates AND it clears the blemishes already on your face. If you want to go all out, adding olive oil and organic honey will be so good! It rejuvenated and tightens the skin!

8035 2018-03-01 06:12:10 What’s remarkable is NM’s record oil output in ‘17 -at about 520,000bpd- would make NM a fairly significant producer on a global scale if it were its own country
8036 2018-03-01 06:12:05 In my case, I'm not a fan of that part of the province as a whole, regardless of the oil sands development.

I'm also not a fan of Edmonton or Red Deer.

Sometimes you don't like a place due to industry, like Espanola's stink or Sudbury's former acid rain, and that's okay too.

8068 2018-03-01 06:05:16 Remember that oil prices began to plummet in mid-2014. The Conservative had a budget problem in early 2015 because oil prices showed no sign of improving. They finally tabled their budget well after the end of the previous fiscal year, having given up on better prices.

8093 2018-03-01 06:01:25 Sanctions are a way of committing brutal acts of war without physically pulling the trigger. Thanks to 'sanctions' there is a famine in Yemen. Plenty of people will die. But you know... United Snakes are allied with the fucking Saudi Oil Barons.
8094 2018-03-01 06:01:16 This is so wrong. 

#Trump suffers from a huge disconnect. He doesn't get that smart #science and #technology lead to greater #profits and #prosperity.

It's mindblowing because Trump considers himself (falsely) to be a great #businessman. He's in bed with #oil and #coal.

8095 2018-03-01 06:01:07 I got a gigantic bottle of avocado oil for free because somebody's mom died.  It has a 500 Degrees smoke point which sounds pretty cool to me.
8096 2018-03-01 06:01:01 Hey! @jiffylube you might want to train your techs to know that they need to bolt the skid plate back on, after an oil change, so it DOESN'T fall the fuck off on the highway while I'm going 70 mph.

8102 2018-03-01 06:00:38 Tonight’s dinner: poached chicken breasts with puy lentils, green beans, toasted pepitas and a mustard/oil/balsamic vinegar dressing.  bloody delicious and a Weight Watchers recipe too.
8103 2018-03-01 06:00:29 I agree that this is a great investment. But @JustinTrudeau continues to push for the KinderMorgan pipeline - a policy that encourages oil sands development and therefore, a betrayal of Canada’s commitment to the Paris Accord.
8104 2018-03-01 06:00:27 2)Once the oil is completely absorbed,apply a thick coat of sunscreen (SPF 30 +) to prevent tanning when you play Holi outdoors.

5)Wear sunglasses to protect delicate skin around eyes.

8113 2018-03-01 05:58:54 Not sure it does.  Both Saudi Arabia and Venezuela ship a different type of crude into the US market.  How does tight oil replace those grades?  Makes no sense to me but woks as an adequate replacement in terms of blind statistics.

8219 2018-03-01 05:35:27 more MCT, extra virgin olive oil, tried avocado oil and more oily fish. Also fattier cuts of meat rather than adding fat. I feel much better not adding extra. I can tolerate a handful of pecan nuts too but no other nuts which is interesting. Not sure why. Digests easily for me.
8220 2018-03-01 05:35:20 Instead I roasted up red peppers and fresh tomatoes with olive oil and poured over the noodles, rather than mixing it in a pot. 
8221 2018-03-01 05:35:09 It’s a matter of business & money. Selling oil & buying silence?
8222 2018-03-01 05:33:52 Tennessee won’t legalize recreational Marijuana for several years but this bill allowing only oil based pills with a limited amount of THC has a chance to pass. I hate that it’s so limited tho. Hope it’s revised as the process goes along

What has this world done to me
8251 2018-03-01 05:28:44 The price of social democracy. The government controls all aspects of German life. They have huge stakes in most German companies, like  Volkswagen.  They also depend on Putin’s oil. Without it, they’d collapse in a day...

8253 2018-03-01 05:28:38 You know what I hate more than trying to eat healthy?! All the effing Tupperware containers that have to be scrubbed clean if olive oil daily 
8254 2018-03-01 05:28:10 no b/c the witch hazel is a toner & shrinks pores the vitamin e oil is just a great moisturizer after soap and toner. leaves your skin feeling super clean and softer than a baby’s bottom and everything is natural which is always a plus!
8255 2018-03-01 05:27:59 めっちゃ申し訳ないんだけどムロのアイコンバオッキーに見える
8256 2018-03-01 05:27:19 Do you also know that when we sell our oil to the US it is for about $30/barrel due to lack of pipeline capacity to ship to other markets for $60/barrel.
8257 2018-03-01 05:27:12 I washed my hair the other day with some coconut oil type tings and afterwards a girl told me I smelled like a merman and I definitely took it as a compliment but thinking on it right now I feel like they wouldn't smell that great...

8263 2018-03-01 05:25:56 Tip 2: A protective layer of coconut or olive oil will save your hair from dry chemical colors. (3/5)
8264 2018-03-01 05:25:52 Oh for a vat of boiling oil
8265 2018-03-01 05:25:46 In winter, less good than warming oil.  Also worse the day after at the gym.
8266 2018-03-01 05:25:30 took a bubble bath with a face mask and lavender oil scrub, so refreshing
8267 2018-03-01 05:25:29 LOL! So true though! How quick folks look over those who aren’t working to make their society better (oil companies) but they rather judge and shake their fingers at us adult entertainers
8268 2018-03-01 05:25:26 U again didn’t read properly, I said India ‘doesn’t’ follow “perfectest” religion, still way ahead of Pakistan.But do name a muslim country with ‘no oil’, big size, sharia, good economy and ‘perfectest’ scenario?! It’s easy to follow sharia, when u have oil drilling out, nothing
8269 2018-03-01 05:25:09 @LeahR77 I suppose the Taxpayers will have to pay almost $2k for the oil changes on it too.
8270 2018-03-01 05:25:08 I'm not against oil. Just against albertans  thinking they can push thru a pipeline with out risks. I work in the business. Directly.
8271 2018-03-01 05:24:58 Whenever I put oil on my eyelashes I hate it bc then I can’t see and it’s blurry
8272 2018-03-01 05:24:50 Plug threw in a free thc oil. Thats love
8273 2018-03-01 05:24:37 If all what is going in ME since I don,t know when .. is for oil and gas .. let take it all .. let Iraq be a poor country for having no resources  but living in peace .
8274 2018-03-01 05:24:29 Thank you, Senator Cantwell, for your vigilance against this completely unhinged administration, especially Zinke, who would happily see mineral and oil extraction in any fragile or protected environment.

8277 2018-03-01 05:24:08 Oil won’t clog my face? I have SUPER sensitive skin. I break out for any little thing
8278 2018-03-01 05:24:04 The trick is butter the pan instead of oil
8279 2018-03-01 05:23:57 as long as it hot, im good enuh. just put likkle oil and foil on the grill and heat it up

8299 2018-03-01 05:20:17 This guy need some beard Oil
8300 2018-03-01 05:20:13 Trump is trying to shrink or eliminate our ocean marine sanctuaries, no doubt to give big oil more room for offshore drilling! Scream bloody murder!!!
8301 2018-03-01 05:19:57 Just a minute. The km pipeline has nothing to do with transporting fuel. That pipe moves raw dilbit. Its got nothing to do with fuel prices. This is big oil gouging the public again.
8302 2018-03-01 05:19:37 If you can find oil or ore deposits then that's great! Especially rare earth minerals!

"Any cold-pressed oil that doesnt meet extra-virgin standards is then refined to get rid of undesirable impurities,giving oil a more neutral flavor &lighter color. Its then blended w/ a bit of premium EVOO to produc what's labeled just "olive oil"

8314 2018-03-01 05:17:51 YES IT IS! 

But, also, lessening natural resource restrictions, building the pipeline---> putin needs a way to get US oil to the coast and opening up all public & protected lands to take the resources.

8323 2018-03-01 05:16:25 Okay I'm saying as cook/chef. If you are facing a oil/grease fire, please throw salt INSTEAD of water. If you throw water it going to make the oil (which is the thing on fire) spread. Pour salt on oil fire will help exorb the oil and suffocate the fire. Please stay safe.

8351 2018-03-01 05:11:15 Google Mobile 1 as Gun Oil. Tons of info and opinions. I've used it and never had any problems. The reasoning is imagine the heat and friction inside an engine, and if Mobile 1 works in a motor it will def work in a firearm.

8375 2018-03-01 05:08:26 Picture a quart bottle of soybean oil.  Might you become obese if you drank a whole bottle of that oil every month?  Keep in mind that soybean oil is 100% fat.
8376 2018-03-01 05:08:00 Nice coveralls for changing the oil in your car.
8377 2018-03-01 05:07:54 I wouldn't call the SA thing wrong (if it were actually true). Many are concerned with his connection to Marc Mezvinsky, Soros,  Rothschilds, and the multiple companies trying to get access to the Tamar, Leviathan, and Aphrodite oil/gas fields.
8378 2018-03-01 05:07:53 big oil signed a secret treaty with THE DAIRY INDUSTRY to keep down the whole sack of lies
8379 2018-03-01 05:07:47 Our electric hot water heater failed yesterday afternoon. Our oil co put it in after the big ice storm as a favor ( it's electric HW). I called the co for help & they put in a new one, today. They #MAGA Moral: buy American, shop local, be loyal & thank God.

8388 2018-03-01 05:06:49 I thought Caltex shipped out of Kenya and sold its assets to @totalkenya. Are they now returning "through the back door"?
Reminds me of Mobil. Sold out to Kennol to form Kobil. Came back and bought Esso. Then sold out again to Libya Oil to form Oilibya.

8396 2018-03-01 05:05:45 One thing Yzerman probably isn't getting enough credit for is having the guts to sell high on Namestnikov. The guy was having a career year.  How many other GMs sell a guy in similar circumstances? None in oil country, that's for sure.

8411 2018-03-01 05:02:42 @frankiecooks - question for you. all this controversy over legitimacy of olive oil is confusing. What brand do you recommend and/or advice for discerning best option for mere mortals at the mercy of grocery store options?

8462 2018-03-01 04:54:44 The whole idea of the “mandate for insurance” is so people pay their own way & get off welfare. Make up your minds. Thought you people were for paying your own way. Keystone pipeline is to move Canadian oil to sell to China through the US while we get nothing out of it but spills
8463 2018-03-01 04:54:26 ... Not sure what that has to do with anything? But please see oil reclamation first hand before judging it.

8469 2018-03-01 04:53:35 The oil helps your nails be flexible, so when put under stress they will bend instead of break. Also when they're saturated in oil, they can't absorb water, which makes them weaker and easier to break

8481 2018-03-01 04:51:21 Jojoba oil most closely resembles the natural oils in your nails, and is the only oil I know of that is small enough to penetrate the nail plate. Other oils will sit on top, which is good for the cuticles, but that's it.
8482 2018-03-01 04:51:17 This is exactly what I was thinking of. Liberals are ecstatic about the banning of gun sales to minors in some state, but many have no issue with sending youth to kill and die for oil somewhere in MENA

8509 2018-03-01 04:47:18 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones. Androgen puts oil glands into overdrive. Even if u take birth control pills, you'll still need a skincare routine.

8511 2018-03-01 04:46:18 Biggest improvement I ever saw was when I started using nail oil, and the best kind is 2 ingredients and I made it myself. The stuff is cheap and will last you foreverrrr.
8512 2018-03-01 04:45:22 “I never knew it’d feel so good for you to dig your elbow into my ass.” - @Arabella_Fae while @AlliLeigh_CB massaged her butt with oil!  Lol!

8514 2018-03-01 04:45:05 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones. Androgen puts oil glands into overdrive. Even if u take birth control pills, you'll still need a skincare routine.
8515 2018-03-01 04:45:03 I have to admit, I do not care if sessions is Deep State or not, because I want him gone for his obsession with Asset forfeiture, and his visceral hatred of medicinal pot and CBD oil.  This guy is stuck in the fifties, (1850).
8516 2018-03-01 04:45:02 Car question: how do you know which kind of oil to put into your car?
8517 2018-03-01 04:44:34 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water
8518 2018-03-01 04:44:21 all i want is a good nights sleep and Russ just slapped the lavender essential oil right out of my hand
8519 2018-03-01 04:44:12 Tea tree oil is good for so many things. How come no one directed me to use it before 
8520 2018-03-01 04:44:09 I need a manly man, one that can change my oil, and build me a fire all in the same breath!

8528 2018-03-01 04:42:53 Late-arriving email from EPA Region 6 press office: EPA today "wrapped up a two-day oil and  natural gas roundtable with stakeholders including state and local leaders,  tribes, industry, trade groups, and environmental nongovernmental organizations."
8529 2018-03-01 04:42:42 Bullshit on resource extraction. We have so much more to offer. Ignorance and rhetoric leave us with no solution to another oil price crash from oversupply.

8535 2018-03-01 04:40:32 I’d be lost without peppermint essential oil, NyQuil, Vick’s, Kleenex, and a diffuser.

8539 2018-03-01 04:39:22 The serum is lightweight and easily absorbed. It contains vitamin e for antioxidants so that your skin can be protected from free radicals. Also the jojoba and ylang ylang help regulate oil production, which is good for dry and oily skin. Apply it after toner

8541 2018-03-01 04:38:41 Tillerson & Trump have managed to keep new sanction off, thus the deal Tillerson cut for Exxon with Russia N. Arctic oil drilling is still hanging out there. I don't believe this news, or, it's not complete. There's another story with the truth underneath this one.

8543 2018-03-01 04:38:31 Yeah I know Joe is pushing it with that one. Got us into war under false pretenses while Cheney wanted the oil. They were both uncharged felons- PotusO spared them the humiliation. They lied to us- just like DT- good luck with Mueller.
8544 2018-03-01 04:38:30 I payed no attention to him until @nooorzy had a post about him blocking her and then I got into it. He’s notorious for dogging the oil and finally I said fuck it

8548 2018-03-01 04:37:43 Cushing used to set WTI price. That has clearly changed. The new game is crude quality b/c lower API gravity oil is in demand. Cushing stocks are down b/c heavier oil is being w/drawn (also GOM) but price is oblivious. Answers are still forming. Maybe @phemsworthcan help (again)!

8554 2018-03-01 04:36:39 Planning and doing are separate realities. Claiming that China and India are good environmental citizens to support an argument for business crippling Canadian policies is intellectual dishonesty.

8563 2018-03-01 04:35:59 Time to impose full oil sanctions on Venezuela. The money is not going to the people. Impose sanctions and offer humanitarian aid. Will be difficult for Maduro to say the USA is not taking a moral stand.

8572 2018-03-01 04:33:51 Nana would cook/dissolve a small tin of anchovies in the olive oil as she started the dish. They just melt away as the onions and garlic sautée, and added a rich flavor to it.

8574 2018-03-01 04:33:33 I’m allergic to eucalyptus so I can’t use it but it’s moslty clove oil which definitely works. It’s a proven powerful antibacterial and it got me through many college flu seasons safely, even when I had a chronic illness that weakened my immune system significantly.

8663 2018-03-01 04:20:05 Maybe @dambisamoyo can ask @Chevron why it doesn't leverage it's OC in geothermal energy (Indonesia) in Mexico, where there's great potential and it's more appealing than oil per Mexico's energy reform.
8664 2018-03-01 04:20:04 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

It is amazing how some Americans think. I remember "Kick their ass and take their gas" bumper stickers in 2003. Those morons couldn't find Iraq on a map but our oil was under their sand.

8722 2018-03-01 04:13:14 meh - it steals money from his oil pals pumping money into is coffers. Trump doesn't give a flying fuck about coal or the people that work it.

8737 2018-03-01 04:11:12 Nestlé claims to be a responsible company. But continuing to sell products produced with REPSA’s oil – presumably to keep the money flowing into its shareholder’s pockets – is anything but responsible. @Nestle #ecocide is not enough to cut ties with #PalmOil producer #REPSA now?

8758 2018-03-01 04:07:57 You don't change the oil, you burry it IN oil, but you can't leave it burried, or it will rot like the one in the picture.

8760 2018-03-01 04:07:30 Thanks Max. I’d add one more reason for investment shift: time horizon. Shale wells are shorter life, fast return. Oil sands are the opposite. (Hence why we’re still seeing inv’t in Montney/Duvernay while o/s drops off.) With uncertainty over future oil demand, shorter warranted.
8761 2018-03-01 04:07:14 It smells like oil sheen on Green street lmao

8769 2018-03-01 04:05:47 You're making this about oil. You're making this about sovereignty of natural resources.  He is talking geo-politics and Russia.  We don't live in a vacuum. 

I, too, am disgusted with our foreign policy entanglements the past 30 years.  But hurting Russia is .

8776 2018-03-01 04:04:29 Yeah, it won't hurt it at all. It's easy to get rid of fingerprints and in my case marker from the previous owner's kid from the screen using any kind of alcohol based or soap based wipes of any kind. The only thing I don't think I'd use on it is anything oil based or bleach.
8777 2018-03-01 04:04:27 Problem is world pricing and the expense of mining oil sands. Oil companies are determining it's not profitable enough.

8806 2018-03-01 03:59:35 US says 57000 fighters on their payroll, vast majority of them Arabs. So how is this going to affect the YPG with 150000 members who are on their primary lands since ISIS are far away from them. The Arabs seem to prefer fighting Syrian government and not ISIS 2 steal oil.
8807 2018-03-01 03:59:27 If I was one of those oil rich Saudi peeps I’d buy up like 500k bitcoin at a time just to mess with people.

8811 2018-03-01 03:58:02 Putting coconut oil on my face but all I can think about with this smell are Samoas.

8826 2018-03-01 03:55:44 Why can we advance in technology, send people and information to the outer limits, prepare to send oil under ground, but... Cannot reclaim flood water and redirect it to states etc. who have a drought
8827 2018-03-01 03:55:43 My poor car just has to make it to next Thursday...brakes are shot, low on oil, it's at 90K miles, and the right side windows don't work.

8833 2018-03-01 03:54:58 2 years ago i was living check to check in college & needed an oil change, so i pulled into this car shop & said "i can't really afford much right now as i haven't been paid yet, but could you help me out? i'll pay you some cash for your time"

8957 2018-03-01 03:36:31 PM sir 
I m student of GST. I had a simple question . " Why don't you tax petroleum & crude oil under GST , so that they get ITC and automatically price get reduced ? "

8973 2018-03-01 03:33:33 ... where 50-90,000 jobs in fisheries & tourism depend, through sacred Indigenous unceded land  ..... what the hell could go wrong Alberta ?? Nothing for you - massive risk for all British Columbians.  Kinder Morgan did a great con job & the oil is not even for us.
8974 2018-03-01 03:33:20 Trump doesn’t care. It is not coal or oil and gas that will continue to destroy our environment
8975 2018-03-01 03:33:05 it boils down to choice, and British Columbians are overwhelmingly against this pipeline. The risks don’t outweigh the rewards. Remember this is about getting more oil to market, they’re looking for bigger profits.Tell America to pay full price and you’re golden

9024 2018-03-01 03:26:37 These people annoy me still running off the failed Alex Salmond hymn sheet. We have been importing more energy for years. Due to over inflated and falling oil levels in north sea. Scotland really can't survive without hangouts from the UK. Fact !
9025 2018-03-01 03:26:32 I actually never even thought of what Olive oil actually comes from lmao, so you just taught me something today

9042 2018-03-01 03:23:53 I’m actually glad my headlights went out, cuz I popped up the hood the first time since July and realized I’m almost low on oil. The idea of changing the oil every year sounds good, but let’s face it, we burn oil, so it is a good thing to periodically check it.

9054 2018-03-01 03:21:06 Territory has been in guyana control since 1899. Venezuela accepted that until 1962. You should focus on why your country is fail state, its people starving and fleeing to other countries despite having largest oil reserves in world.

9108 2018-03-01 03:12:44 #Foamingcleansers work well for many skin types. They remove oil and dirt sans over-drying.
9109 2018-03-01 03:12:39 Works Double: toffee, roasted garlic herb cheese swirls, Rovelli pralines and lively House garlic & olive oil crakcers and dark chocolate
9110 2018-03-01 03:12:35 Next consider picking up an oil for those days you’re feeling extra dry, doesn’t have to be expensive. I love the Burt’s bees face oil. Also anything from belief is great for dry skin. Then for hydrating mask the Patchology cloud mask is hands down the best for the $!
9111 2018-03-01 03:12:34 You should have seen the gun case then lol RT @erikastruth: @danteorland I used to get my oil changed at Walmart all the time lolol
9112 2018-03-01 03:12:26 can’t wait to see the results from using wild growth oil.
9113 2018-03-01 03:12:05 I made a spray! I only use doterra essential oils! But in a 2oz bottle I put 5 drops of frankincense, 5 drops lavender, 5 drops geranium, 5 drops peppermint and filled the rest up with fractionated coconut oil! I loved it! Went away in a few days!

9117 2018-03-01 03:11:41 My coworker was telling me about how his grandma’s name is Olive Oil Bacon. Like, that’s her real name.
9118 2018-03-01 03:11:41 Oh my that's sounds so bad...glad that's not what he said.
Always listen to or look for the trascript of entire words...never take the word of fake news.
9119 2018-03-01 03:11:32 It's funny that the NDP is spouting off about all the new jobs they have created. Meanwhile those 'new' jobs are actually formerly unemployed oilfield workers going back to work now that the price of oil has rebounded. But the NDP doesn't want you to know that lol.

9131 2018-03-01 03:10:12 Common sense is indeed not so common as we think. I’ll be wasting YOUR time if I engage with you any further. We may succeed squeezing some oil from a piece of rock but somethings can never be changed...
9132 2018-03-01 03:09:56 Used a egg wash recipe that I found online with Panko breadcrumbs. Might’ve been the oil, might’ve fried it too fast, but it ain’t come out good.

9138 2018-03-01 03:08:54 DiVincenzo couldn't get away with the walk that time. To the U12 we go, with the score Villanova 36, Seton Hall 30. Not quite Big East Tournament vs. USF ugly, but with 11:37 to go, we'll quote Bobby Gonzalez here and say this isn't an oil painting.
9139 2018-03-01 03:08:54 Exactly. Tom claims he’s in communication with high ranking government officials, and you know who they are but he can’t talk about it, and they talked about things he can’t talk about at places he can’t talk about...the point is he’s a fucking crazy snake oil salesman
9140 2018-03-01 03:08:44 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'

9145 2018-03-01 03:07:57 I said to, and then realized that I wouldn't work for an oil & gas company or Bechtel, so now I'm torn

9157 2018-03-01 03:06:11 Of course, the complete collapse of oil prices and our oil industry had nothing to do with companies looking for cheaper, quicker payout plays? And isn't it great that CANADIAN investment stepped up to fill the gap? Now we own MORE of our own resource companies and keep profits.

watching the fox pick off my goldfish
from their sorry, golden state —
and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
9165 2018-03-01 03:04:48 I forgot how to oil paint....

9169 2018-03-01 03:04:25 Bill and Melinda Gates have tried to feed the starving people with minimal success. The crooked leaders keep siphoning the money for their coffers. Just look at oil rich Venezuela and see the starving people due to corruption, socialism. You have to get the food to the people.
9170 2018-03-01 03:04:23 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
9171 2018-03-01 03:04:18 .@RPinDenverCo I suppose U also already tried coconut oil "oil pulling" thru teeth? Coconut Oil is Anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-microbial.

9177 2018-03-01 03:02:54 If you want Ozil to shine in big games(which he does for Germany) play better in big games as a team. He is a team player. He isn't gonna win you games all by himself while everyone else is playing shit. He is the oil not the fucking engine. Stop slating him.
9178 2018-03-01 03:02:52 Akin to asking if whale oil enabled fossil fuels, if horse enabled automobile & whether today's infra will enable tomorrow's.
EFW is a medium term alternative. When costs>benefits, we'll not even ask this Q
What change agents will get us to that point in the evolutionary process?
9179 2018-03-01 03:02:38 Not enough oil residue tho.

9194 2018-03-01 03:00:46 Did Stats Can mention the status of oil and gas imports which would give a clearer picture of what is actually happening in the energy sector?
9195 2018-03-01 03:00:45 Coconut oil too!
9196 2018-03-01 03:00:41 So possibility Trump rolls out tariffs tomorrow as admin official mulls total oil embargo on Venezuela.

9238 2018-03-01 02:51:03 How do you explain the anti tank missiles for the Ukraine and the push for US dominance of oil market, both repugnant to Russia?
9239 2018-03-01 02:51:00 I hate seeing these Gay hating protestors. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Protesting #KMX = killing #LGBTQ @VictoriaPride @manny_ottawa
9240 2018-03-01 02:50:55 Una de las cosas más chidas del Non Stop Ska fue que, a parte disfrutar al máximo la música de Oil Skall Mates, Hepcat, NYSJE, SKAPARA y Bad Manners, se le arregló su rodilla a la @Phananarama bailando ska.
9241 2018-03-01 02:50:47 US Trump Administration official states that US is considering oil-related sanctions on Venezuela to place pressure on President Maduro and doesn't rule out a full US oil embargo on Venezuela which could cause a fairly significant shock to the oil-market.
9242 2018-03-01 02:50:44 i should totally sleep but facebook is showing me how olive oil is made and i can’t say no to That

9252 2018-03-01 02:48:57 The most common rumor I see is that his dad has mad oil money. I have ZERO idea how people would even know that though. Ringhand seems like the best option.
9253 2018-03-01 02:48:53 That's right. I forgot about his sideline as a snake oil salesman. Probably his main income really. 

Still you gotta be pretty evil to sell BS cures for a living. Isn't that basically the plot of "The Good Place"?
9254 2018-03-01 02:48:50 I love how people think coal mining or oil rigging or other careers that destroy your body are honorable hard work, but doing something literally everyone enjoys is degrading because you let other people watch. K.
9255 2018-03-01 02:48:42 Indias 90%uraniam comes from canada . All developing countries r hungry  for energy ... See the cpec why chaina making only for oil to reduce pressure on Malacca . I don't know u know anything about international relations or not
9256 2018-03-01 02:48:35 Are you kidding me? He maintained sanctions against Russia. Bombed Syria pretty much shoved in their face that were taking away their oil and gas money by selling it to Europe ourselves easy on Rush in my fanny
9257 2018-03-01 02:48:32 One time after a party I decided to cook chicken and there was no oil so I used bud lite

9261 2018-03-01 02:47:28 I have scheduled and rescheduled my oil change at least six times but I'm about to reschedule it again because I want to drink and sleep in tomorrow.
9262 2018-03-01 02:47:23 What we are seeing in oil right now is an unwind of MM options positions ..fwiw
9263 2018-03-01 02:47:18 Further proof that Harper should have put more emphasis on education rather than oil.

9274 2018-03-01 02:45:55 Always has been and likely always will be case when MLPs get sold there are few natural buyers on other side so moves are amplified. Energy is hated. MLP lack of commodity exposure is a myth.....oil down.
9275 2018-03-01 02:45:51 That’s so dead, Lol.. I use African’s Best & it works well with moisturing my scalp because it dries quickly. The oil and castor oil grease are legit, especially when you mix them together 
9276 2018-03-01 02:45:41 [Hurricane Region - Porsche Club of America] Anyone here ever used a Fumoto oil drain valve on...
9277 2018-03-01 02:45:30 Why I'm a bit optimistic (not totally) because when I study the populism in Venezuela, one of the reasons it failed its democracy is that its welfare programs are entirely dependent on one industry - oil. When oil prices went down, so does its programs, so does its democracy.
9278 2018-03-01 02:45:16 Ngl my self care routine is BOMB. Hair mask, long shower w beautiful soaps, body scrubs, & moisturizers, get out & dry off, coconut oil in my hair, serum on my face & moisturizer on top. I feel AMAZING.
9279 2018-03-01 02:45:16 hell, i really want your body oil but ive only got like 20$ cad ;;;;
9280 2018-03-01 02:45:10 Venezuelans would benefit from a coup by the way. They are starving in an oil rich nation. #Socialismsucks

9295 2018-03-01 02:43:03 There were several carts parked nearby, the bullocks had been unyoked and stood patiently chewing hay. In the cloth shops, customers stood around, examining, buying. In the oil vendor’s, the owner dozed, a man with a huge paunch leaning against a large pot of oil.

Please don't be so dumb.
9303 2018-03-01 02:41:34 The way he rubbed that oil in the pan! His arms are so hairy. I cannot deal. 
9304 2018-03-01 02:41:14 Well oil ran out at 00:30, time to freeze my arse off.
9305 2018-03-01 02:41:12 For the Jeep: what ever oil comes with the coupon from jiffy lube 

For the other car: it’s a lease. Take it to the dealership. Not my fuckin problem.
9306 2018-03-01 02:41:09 Excellent piece. But the debt for Adaptation Swop is not to combat over tourism. Except for Aldabra the other islands are not protected - just the sea around them. But an Indian- sponsored naval base on Assumption and fast track oil prospecting and drilling have been announced
9307 2018-03-01 02:40:54 @livi_f Great Welcomes, joys of these wonders products. I'm all for exquisite, delicate, coolant creme for the pores of my skin. Helps my skin stay tight,  smooth, and soft after effects.  A light ,oil creme that soothes my skin w/ cinnamon sugar  scent that encompasses the air.
9308 2018-03-01 02:40:39 Whats worse: hot oil splashed in your eye or taking second place in PUBG due to not staying in the play zone? 

Both just happened to me in the last 10 minutes and let me tell ya I’dchoose the pain of the oil over that public humiliation in PUBG any day
9309 2018-03-01 02:40:31 Looking good man. I need to break out my @BrownellsInc apron some more and get some oil and metal chips back on it.

9313 2018-03-01 02:40:02 And I am not pro pipeline but we must fund a way to get the oil out of Alberta.
9314 2018-03-01 02:39:30 WHY WOULD ANYONE GIVE MONEY TO THIS SNAKE OIL SALESMAN?
ARE EVANGELICALS THAT GULLIBLE?
I question that they are mature/knowledgeable to vote.
9315 2018-03-01 02:39:20 So I've learned that steaming / smoking out my bathroom is a great way to 1. relieve stress 2. relieve sore muscles 3. get high as fuck and 4. liquify my coconut oil for after the shower 
9316 2018-03-01 02:39:09 just took the best shower and put almond oil on omg i feel so good right now
9317 2018-03-01 02:38:56 1/4 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup orange juice - if you want it less sweet, use 3 tbsp lemon juice.
3 Tbsp honey
1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger (cheat tip: the preground ginger you buy is fine)
1 tsp sesame oil
Optional: For richer stuff like steak add a teaspoon of oyster sauce.
9318 2018-03-01 02:38:25 What's EE? The only requirement is that it's "pure" olive oil.
9319 2018-03-01 02:37:49 Peace out world about to go rewatch my show and oil down my baby hairs for tomorrow
9320 2018-03-01 02:37:46 Article states plant-based ingredients are (of course) healthier:
"For a healthy choice, use just a small amount of vegetable oil or reduced fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.”
#vegan #animalrights #butter #lard
9321 2018-03-01 02:37:36 Instead of a Galileo thermometer, I just eyeball the room temperature using a jar of coconut oil that periodically melts and re-solidifies.
9322 2018-03-01 02:37:13 Got my diffuser on with peppermint oil so it’s safe to say it’s time to relax and head to bed 
9323 2018-03-01 02:36:56 I still want to know how butterfat is better than olive oil?
9324 2018-03-01 02:36:42 If I did blessings I would use a lovely skincare oil blend
9325 2018-03-01 02:36:33 I got a lot done, I did all this weeks and next weeks homework, I did my oil change (finally), I went and got babe some shoes for work & now I’m about to make breakfast for dinner then film a tutorial 
9326 2018-03-01 02:36:24 Haven’t given up yet. I’m not sure why the oil haven’t fixed the obvious”special teams” coaching. Possibly the coach as well ? The NHL need to take a good look in the mirror. Officiating has been horrible which slows/ destroys the game. Video review should be abolished
9327 2018-03-01 02:36:23 Don, it's Vlad you remember the 500 mil I gave you now I want oil at 68 a barrel or more and dude don't fire on my troops in Syria that's F'd up. I will release the pix of you pissing on the bed on top of the hookers if you don't comply. I miss Chris Steele

9329 2018-03-01 02:36:06 Kushner is a high rollers for certain!  Send him back to the middle East to get some of that oil money.  How else can he get bailed out.
9330 2018-03-01 02:35:46 Cannabis oil jacuzzies :) actually that would be a great idea, I know at least one person that's been advocating for it
9331 2018-03-01 02:35:15 Proverbs 21:17 KJV He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.

9332 2018-03-01 02:35:03 It is incredibly funny to me that there are billboards calling for Snow's head and while obliterating Chiarelli in their recent deals. What's that say about Pete? About Oil fans?
9333 2018-03-01 02:35:02 Foundational moment in energy history, OPEC oil embargo. The lessons were there for Canada, but were ignored. Countries like Denmark got it right. 100% RE is on horizon. #ChargedUp

9338 2018-03-01 02:34:23 @HCL_Healthcare We  use coconut oil with cotton to remove the colours. This is after washing it in cold water for a few minutes.And after that we apply besan with milk to remove colours completely without any harm #CelebrateHOLIstically #ContestAlert @sanchitabhartiy
9339 2018-03-01 02:34:21 Millennials may be interested to know that after the 1989 #ExxonValdez& Nestucca barge spills, BC & Canada together had quite a robust marine oil spill response capability. With few large spill incidents occurring after that, interest started flagging badly about a decade ago.
9340 2018-03-01 02:34:21 Why ask when you will do what the oil & gas industry pays you to do anyway. Why not just tell us what your vote will reflect and what protections you’re removing.

9352 2018-03-01 02:31:42 Hmm...Costa Rica and Ireland produce zero oil. Denmark = 131,000 b/d. France = 15,000 b/d. Canada? 4 million b/d. So, no major producing countries, none of Canada's competitors.

9357 2018-03-01 02:31:10 Leo,  U should be thankful for Canada , not attacking our energy industries while USA built 10,000 miles of Oil + Gas pipe, ramped up offshore oil exports and now is a major LNG exporter. So much oil taken from under the gulf coast of Louisiana that the shoreline is subsiding.
9358 2018-03-01 02:31:04 Oz lasts me about a month. I dab and oil vape too.

9361 2018-03-01 02:30:32 AND also oil rich countries are at war? Why is that? Certainly not becuase of Muslims but I wouldn’t expect someone with your racist intellect to understand. You are just a poor American unable to see that your country has been lying to you for the last 200 years

9375 2018-03-01 02:28:37 Also, if you don’t have almond butter on hand (which is expensive), you can substitute for peanut butter or coconut oil. Also, I’ve made these with applesauce and cinnamon instead of bananas, which was great too!

9380 2018-03-01 02:28:07 Someone buy my vape, it comes with the charger and some juice and CBD oil. Trying to upgrade
9381 2018-03-01 02:28:04 You need to watch Deepwater Horizon movie with Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell to get an idea of how dangerous off shore oil drilling will be with out safety regulations and enforcement. The gulf coast fisheries just started to recover from oil spill.
9382 2018-03-01 02:27:41 Having a shitton of oil lets you do that.  See: Norway
9383 2018-03-01 02:27:30 omg y’all #lifehack if you have a stuffy nose and can’t breathe lol put some peppermint oil under your nose and you’ll be able to breathe in like a minute. it burns like hell but you’ll be able to breathe

9388 2018-03-01 02:26:57 I imagine his comment could be drawing from linoleic acid only substitution trials, i.e. the Sydney Diet Heart Study.

It is sometimes argued that in many RCTs LA is increased along with omega-3 (e.g. ALA in soybean oil, EPA/DHA fish, etc.) and the latter produces the benefits.
9389 2018-03-01 02:26:44 There is a lot of snake oil in this business. And I am here to debunk it!
9390 2018-03-01 02:26:42 Capitalism will never be able to fix this problem. Remember the Paris conference where they said anything above 2 degrees Celsius increase would be catastrophic? While oil companies alone have 5 times the amount that can be burned before that limit is reached.
9391 2018-03-01 02:26:39 I bought mro, Apc, kmi this am. Wish I waited. All of oil stocks are on the bottom of support if it breaks is what I’m worried about

9409 2018-03-01 02:24:21 I have no idea how to get to my engine. Shit it took the factory trained technicians over an hour to remove my oil filter.
9410 2018-03-01 02:24:19 Yea, I've got naturally oily skin. That's probably more of a risk for whites who traditionally have much less oil lol. I don't notice a difference when I'm in hot or cold water. I just coconut oil up afterwards!

9414 2018-03-01 02:24:10 If you have oily skin like me, a face wash with benzoyl peroxide helps to decrease oil and prevent acne. I use the one from Clean and Clear, only $5 from Target
9415 2018-03-01 02:23:52 I mean you could prob convince your mechanic to change the oil after he does the brakes tom
9416 2018-03-01 02:23:51 The #fracking oil and gas industry is in an era of diminishing denial.

It is #UNnaturalgas folks...

So this whole #Trump thing has been going on 12 years now?

9439 2018-03-01 02:20:28 No the Russians are going, they're going to pump oil in to China from the West for Petroyuan, and that will piss off the loan sharks who force us in to killing people to protect their Petrodollar.
9440 2018-03-01 02:20:19 I use olive oil. I used to use canola and grapeseed too but that's somehow bad now
9441 2018-03-01 02:20:15 My pops would tell me, “just because you know how to change the oil, it doesn’t make you a mechanic”
9442 2018-03-01 02:20:04 Perhaps they thought that the hole in the platform could be used to drill for oil! #PCPOldr

9468 2018-03-01 02:16:55 And that's just where the problem comes in. If a driver sponsored by Snake Oil, his father's company, repeatedly crashes out of races and runs into part failures, the bills will add up. Eventually, this problem can snowball into a situation where Snake Oil is no longer keen (1/2)

9487 2018-03-01 02:12:07 But you’re still pushing pipelines. Bit of a contradiction there, no? How about we stop propping up a dying industry and invest in R & D and retraining workers so they can have careers in clean energy, rather than facing unemployment again as oil continues to fade?

9529 2018-03-01 02:06:11 Pretty funny Hill. You & Obama knew about Russian Election meddling in 2015 & did nothing! After all u both gave Russia (20% of r Uranium,a pass on Ukraine, oil rich land in Alaska,etc), U maybe thought they’d b on ur side! U both were much nicer to Putin.
9530 2018-03-01 02:06:11 God every time my suitemates decide to cook anything w oil esp frozen shit its. So painful
9531 2018-03-01 02:06:09 I was real tired of smoking CO2 oil so I bought flower to smoke today & my place finally smells like home again 
9532 2018-03-01 02:06:03 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
9533 2018-03-01 02:05:55 And what was Russia's end game in electing Trump? Since being elected Trump has kept troops/bases on Ru border, killed Exxon-Ru oil deal, kept old sanction + implemented new ones, made RT register as a foreign agent, sold weapons to anti-Ru Ukraine and bombed Syria several times
9534 2018-03-01 02:05:53 Nutmeggers love their pizza pies. For me, Colony Pizza is da bomb. They make their own hot oil to drizzle on top of the brick oven pizza. My mouth is watering recalling it.
9535 2018-03-01 02:05:45 A friend actually just gave me an essential oil bracelet, so I’m curious to see how it works and how strong the smell will be.

Also, next woodhull we need to get dinner again! That was definitely one of the highlights of woodhull was having dinner with you and your friends.
9536 2018-03-01 02:05:30 my makeup definitely looked better yesterday when i used oil underneath my makeup
9537 2018-03-01 02:05:29 Sprinkle a clean tissue with a couple of drops of lavender or another relaxing essential oil (I’m using lavender and ylangylang) and drop it on your pillow to inhale as you’re counting sheep! It really works, and it smells heavenly...

9539 2018-03-01 02:05:13 Take biotin, I do oil hair masks like once a week as well, helps so much
9540 2018-03-01 02:05:05 Only problem is Thony and myself charge our own oil to get alone time away from the kids. This impedes on this.
9541 2018-03-01 02:05:02 Seriously, do you know how much subsidies the oil coal industry receive??
9542 2018-03-01 02:04:12 Ross is so underrated, I can find organic coconut oil on the super cheaps 
9543 2018-03-01 02:03:49 Coking coal makes steel. Which comes back as casing for oil wells.  Even still for ft Mac and buildings in Alberta
9544 2018-03-01 02:03:30 It is better to be sure, my dearest and long long standing friend, is always having them cut out. Lived on a farm nearly all her life and is fair and freckly. Except for her bum I think every part of her has had a skin cancer. We had no sunscreen as kids used coconut oil 
9545 2018-03-01 02:03:19 hahahahaha marc you have no idea do you. Tar oil is sweet piss all in revenue. Less than 2% of the total.
9546 2018-03-01 02:03:16 Carbs make you fat! Really? Yeah! Potatoes, bread, pasta, rice! Or is it the cheese/sour cream on that potato? Or the burger between those buns? Or the meatballs on that pasta? Or the oil the rice is fried in? Carbs are not the enemy! A diet high in complex carbs is optimal!

9553 2018-03-01 02:02:52 Coconut oil and ghee contain a healthy type of saturated fat, which does not become damaged and carcinogenic in cooking.
9554 2018-03-01 02:02:45 Its a childish act of candle march by @bureaucracy2day while protecting their colleagues. Police taking appropriate action against manhandling of #DChiefSecretory. Apology from @ArvindKejriwal &  @AamAadmiParty does serve the purpose? @LtGovDelhi must put water not oil in fire.
9555 2018-03-01 02:02:44 my hair stylist just exposed argan oil I’m shocked
9556 2018-03-01 02:02:42 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.

9566 2018-03-01 02:00:39 No. I just dabbed my eyes, accepted my free oil change, and drove away.  #backtoschool
9567 2018-03-01 02:00:27 You know you're old when you asked to have your bills paid for and you oil changed for your birthday
9568 2018-03-01 02:00:22 I used to think a requirement of my husband was going to be changing my oil but at this point I’d be more impressed with one who can drive on the hwy in pouring rain and not get stressed..

9572 2018-03-01 01:59:55 Easy. The one with that always makes chicken wings. I have to change the oil in my car later
9573 2018-03-01 01:59:11 he switches to coconut oil when his friends come over
9574 2018-03-01 01:59:07 I love how I will never have to pay for an oil change for my car 
9575 2018-03-01 01:58:54 I actually cried reading one of her books when I was getting my oil changed and the attendant thought I was crying because my oil change was free.  LOL.  #nope

9586 2018-03-01 01:57:51 As someone who's been following this since it's inception (mined BTC on my CPU back in college), you aren't wrong. *coins are basically modern Ponzi schemes and ICOs are basically modern snake oil salesmen. Can't wait for my friends in the #SEC to crack down on this.
9587 2018-03-01 01:57:24 Castor oil + coconut oil. Never fails!
9588 2018-03-01 01:57:20 Quebec doesn’t want to increase their GDP with finding oil. That would threaten their transfer money from Alberta
9589 2018-03-01 01:57:09 You know you’re a woman when you ate skinnypop and a salad with oil dressing for dinner and feel guilty about that brownie you just ate. Mind fuckery
9590 2018-03-01 01:56:55 Hey guess what. Coconut oil is just, Nut Fat.

9595 2018-03-01 01:56:26 You borrowed the entire gdp/job growth... it nets zero or less. the truth is that in an environment where oil is going up, our energy investment went down.

9605 2018-03-01 01:55:03 Lots of interesting figures in there!

Have you seen any stats that estimate what the annual impact to government revenues is by Canada not receiving the world price for oil? (Fed impact, provincial impact)

9615 2018-03-01 01:53:44 Seems too good to be *true*. How would we know this isn't just a PR move & Exon (the umbrella corporation) will now just * launder* the oil through their affiliates?
9616 2018-03-01 01:53:38 Naaaah, please don't.

9646 2018-03-01 01:48:41 I suppose all poor communities with mining as their main economic activity, their bread and butter involve whole families. It is the same in mining coal, oil, gold, other minerals.

It is frustrating to think that maybe generations of Congo families will be stuck there.
9647 2018-03-01 01:48:41 I intake of about 0.5g of THC from the oil daily, it varies how much CBD is present from time to time but that keep me healthy and sharp. I vape and smoke, but I take oil 2x a day, with more cbd and sativas during the day, and less cbd and thcv in night

9650 2018-03-01 01:48:09 It is a cause but it’s not the worst... CO2 is the biggest greenhouse gas, and the burning of coal, oil, and gas is the main contributor. Actually animal agriculture is third, after deforestation (a lot of which veganism contributes to btw).

9681 2018-03-01 01:41:56 I use baby oil 
9682 2018-03-01 01:41:44 You mean like:
Shutting down the oil and gas industry. 
Baiting Trump to the extent NAFTA is at risk.
Making wild accusations against India
Importing Islamist enslavers, while ignoring genocide victims.
9683 2018-03-01 01:41:30 Face mask on, listening to my fave Spotify playlist & eucalyptus oil in my diffuser. In my element right now 
9684 2018-03-01 01:41:25 Also a good way to make H20 the new oil...look at all the companies buying water sources...Coca Cola etc
9685 2018-03-01 01:41:25 カタツムリのエロってでっかく書いてあるかんじがすき ほしいわ
9686 2018-03-01 01:41:12 Bentonite Clay masks work really well. Also try putting Tea Tree oil in your face wash :)
9687 2018-03-01 01:41:09 the oil is so pricy but theres another CBD pet cream for rashes i can get from my friend's store i will try out later...and yes the soft cone i already looked into and will check out later. the plastic cone was just the quickest one i can get from my friend nearby

9689 2018-03-01 01:40:46 I’m so stressed I don’t know what to do. A btc layin here with lavender essential oil all over her body listening to “Ocean Sounds of Marthas Vineyard” and I still can’t relax
9690 2018-03-01 01:40:43 @SentinAM WTI Oil bullish, TP=62,25. Technical analysis

9692 2018-03-01 01:40:37 Because you are smart. 
9693 2018-03-01 01:40:30 We are not Norway, they have a totally different economy, all based on oil.
The fact is we voted to leave, is that beyond your comprehension ?

9695 2018-03-01 01:40:24 Oh yes. Especially considering I put some MCT oil in my stupid coffee this morning and haven't wanted to eat anything all day because of an upset stomach. I really hate coffee
9696 2018-03-01 01:40:20 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
9697 2018-03-01 01:40:04 My car needs an oil change every 2-3 weeks 
9698 2018-03-01 01:39:59 Today was a hella productive day! Did two oil changes, fixed an ac system, and washed the inside and out of my work truck!
9699 2018-03-01 01:39:55 Yes indeed. Taking out my wood stove and the hearth where it sits. I'm going to start burning a LOT of coal and oil. LMAO!!!
MAGA.
9700 2018-03-01 01:39:53 Fuck acrylic paint it dries fast af, I'm sticking to oil paint
9701 2018-03-01 01:39:44 I get oil changes pretty regularly and I should’ve had like two since the last time I got one and I feel like my oil change guy is gonna judge me for it. 
9702 2018-03-01 01:39:29 @Neil_Irwin  The problem is basic premise. The theory assumes one,factor, labor costs, drives inflation.  Low unemployment will push wages higher, employers will pass costs on. Never has happened. Highest inflation caused by oil shocks in 1970 s. Wages always lag prices.
9703 2018-03-01 01:39:25 @BradWall306 fought nearly every day to get pipelines built to move the oil which in turn frees up trains to move the grain.
9704 2018-03-01 01:39:16 New motor mounts on the coupe & oil change this saturday 
9705 2018-03-01 01:39:11 Oil change man said I need new front tires so if I don’t explode on the freeway I guess I’ll do that tmr
9706 2018-03-01 01:39:07 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9707 2018-03-01 01:38:59 Would have to be fairly tall with all the oil trucks and farm equipment rolling through there.

9712 2018-03-01 01:38:48 Q: Why are you no longer a Republican?

A. The #GOP became the party of:

 Tax cuts for the rich

 Anti-immigration

 Racism

 Pollution

 Big oil
 Anti-LGBT

 Deficit spending
9713 2018-03-01 01:38:40 If this were the gold market, I would say market makers may have leases. So they have the gold, the gold will be delivered when the futures contract needs it. But the metal is not in the warehouse. I don't know the oil market, so I dont know what kind of arrangements they have
9714 2018-03-01 01:38:38 Refinishing my Dan Wesson revolver  grip. About 8 more coats of linseed oil and it will be done.
9715 2018-03-01 01:38:30 Here is an observation of irony: the sheriff's last name is ISRAEL and a CAIR warrior (Muslim). Oil and water don't mix, so yeah, something funny is going on. Hollywood couldn't come with a better script, or could they?
9716 2018-03-01 01:38:24 At tonight’s special meeting, @CityofHoboken City Council unanimously passed ordinance on 1st reading to allow #UnionDryDock purchase.

Residents spoke on:
- Eminent Domain
- Budget
- Pedestrian Safety
- Underwater Life
- Oil Spills 

Should we have a continuous Hoboken walkway?
9717 2018-03-01 01:38:04 I need to run to my car but my neighbors outside and I got a hot oil treatment in my hair
9718 2018-03-01 01:37:59 Aspiration has no fees in any way for a checkings account, can withdraw money from any atm w/o incurring fees, they don’t invest a single DIME in the oil & gas industry. Literally 0$ in anything that harms our environment. Can you do the same?
9719 2018-03-01 01:37:59 HAHAHA! NEVER! Never in a hundred million years. Racism, bullying, bigotry, discrimination, guns, 3rd world hunger, need for oil and its products, the list is endless, always has been and always will be here. You can't stop ANY of them. Be realistic and open your eyes.
9720 2018-03-01 01:37:57 とても見習っていきたい
9721 2018-03-01 01:37:53 My car was acting up and I was worried thinking I messed it up ... come to find out all it needed was oil  I swear wtf I’m so dumb
9722 2018-03-01 01:37:38 Russia busts Erdogan getting oil from ISIS, Trump withdraws support for the Kurdish resistance and supports Turkey’s aggression.  No one says a damn thing.  
We Support the Kurdish resistance!  Down with Erdogan! Down with Trump!
9723 2018-03-01 01:37:16 Yes, yes it does. North Sea Oil. Explained that to my students yesterday. Who thought their money came from sweaters and frozen fish.
9724 2018-03-01 01:37:16 And all that damn baby oil. Can’t be good for the pores.
9725 2018-03-01 01:37:13 Who;s going 2 pay 4 any oil spills!Or clean up;s?To CDN &USA coast line?&Eco &Nature &Beaches destroyed?Plus B.C.;S Tourist Industry!People come 2 Vancouver 4 scenery &beaches &prestine coast line!Is Alberta going foot those destruction bills?Hello Reality 102!
9726 2018-03-01 01:37:00 Do you think the banks/producers currently have all the oil indicated by the short position on that chart?  If so, what does that say about supply just sitting out there?  If there really is that much supply...what do you think happens to price?
9727 2018-03-01 01:36:56 If the Syrian children were to bleed oil, the world would rush to their rescue. #SyriaIsBleeding #PrayForSyria
9728 2018-03-01 01:36:50 Hey man, don’t get me wrong, I do just fine.  What I see is a snake oil salesman that duped you suckers for over 60 years.  Don’t worry, there are plenty of chatlatans out there that will gladly take your money, his passing won’t stop you from being swindled.
9729 2018-03-01 01:36:48 I hope it’s known as the Flakenstein Bill. 
9730 2018-03-01 01:36:40 Whale Oil Beef Hooked!!!! ;)

9732 2018-03-01 01:36:28 yeah it’s gross, if you get your dreads wet and don’t take care of them properly that’s what happens. non-blacks are more likely to get it since they naturally produce a lot more oil from their scalp
9733 2018-03-01 01:36:28 Lemme go get my Holy Oil!

9736 2018-03-01 01:35:49 I feel like there should be an oil painting of this. Sessions dining with Rosenstein. I'm losing my orientation.
9737 2018-03-01 01:35:46 Peppermint shower and peppermint oil in the diffuser. I’ll feel so good
9738 2018-03-01 01:35:45 Cannabis is a wonderful natural resource. It has been vilified by #BigPharma and shut down by the oil industry in the 1930's because of Hemp's properties. As soon as we put people's well being over profits, we will be able to benefit from the natural benefits our Earth offers.
9739 2018-03-01 01:35:34 I need to oil my dog

9742 2018-03-01 01:35:14 ………………は？
9743 2018-03-01 01:35:10 50 jobs? You obviously have zero clue on what it takes to produce and ship LNG and oil.....
9744 2018-03-01 01:34:53 You can defeat isis in big cities like Mosul and Raqqa but can't finish in small pockets, what's up at Deir az Zour? Oil fields?
9745 2018-03-01 01:34:51 Interesting visual!  Haha
9746 2018-03-01 01:34:40 yes!!! oil is really the devin in disguise
9747 2018-03-01 01:34:35 Hace ya más de 15 años que #Venezuela no es un “país petrolero” #Oil #PDVSA
9748 2018-03-01 01:34:27 Wow. This could be hugely significant and could lead to Putin throwing Trump to the wolves. That oil deal was worth $1.4 Trillion, with Putin pocketing $500 Billion personally. An epic money grab thwarted by pesky sanctions. Mueller may get his man after all.
9749 2018-03-01 01:34:26 David Nickarz prefers killing foreign Gays. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Protesting #KMX = killing #LGBTQ @PrideWinnipeg
9750 2018-03-01 01:34:21 Oil prices fall while gas prices rise? Always being screwed
9751 2018-03-01 01:34:00 With more oil if necessary
9752 2018-03-01 01:33:57 @torij126 @BlacknessAmour @Flawsey @P_dPowell @MsPerfect10x @Butta_15 @OWNAmbassadors Ladies U must try “BLACK AMOUR”Her products R Natural & Organic.I have all.I used the DEEP CONDITIONING PROTEIN ENHANCER W/SWEET ALMOND OIL my hair was so soft &I didn’t have 2apply oil

9754 2018-03-01 01:33:40 So if a truck from B.C. is bringing their lumber, wine, agriculture to Alberta to sell should Alberta get a percentage of their revenue made from these sales?  Same with the oil.  Why should you receive anything?
9755 2018-03-01 01:33:30 四枚目かっこいい
9756 2018-03-01 01:33:29 Well, considering their money comes from oil...
9757 2018-03-01 01:33:27 Vietnam massage with lotus oil also good maa
9758 2018-03-01 01:33:16 When properly prepared, olives, like nuts, supply the place of butter and flesh meats. The oil, as eaten in the olive, is far preferable to animal oil or fat. It serves as a laxative. Its use will be found beneficial to consumptives,
9759 2018-03-01 01:33:10 In large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add milk, butter and egg; stir until flour is moistened.
Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat until drop of water sizzles; brush lightly with oil. In batches, scoop batter by scant 1/4-cupfuls.
9760 2018-03-01 01:33:03 Oil change and tune up in the am 
9761 2018-03-01 01:32:45 The first thing you can do to help deal with a burnt coil in your #portable #vaporizer for #oil or #wax is to just clean the actual coil. You wanna make sure you get all the nasty gunk build up out.
9762 2018-03-01 01:32:44 Yeah I stay on top of oil changes and tire rotations but I cleaned my car last weekend and I had so many pairs of shoes and water bottles! Lol
9763 2018-03-01 01:32:39 I could go with a Pilsner to help burn the midnight oil
9764 2018-03-01 01:32:36 Women gotta be independent these days because most dudes are bums. I saw a dude sit in his car while his girl put oil in the car. Fuck that it should be the other way around

9775 2018-03-01 01:31:08 This is why I suggested forming an E 20.  This to leverage the power of a unified entity (avoiding EU mistakes) & leveraging the power of Supply. Remember the OPEC oil embargo?  Your combined resources can be used to negotiate a better deal.
China 1.3 B people

9792 2018-03-01 01:29:15 Thank you for weighing in on this! The mainstream media outlets are so obsessed with reporting about TrumpleThinSkin's stupid tweets that they keep citizens ignorant of the USA's unconscionable involvement in these civilian deaths, just to placate the Saudi oil'igarchs.
9793 2018-03-01 01:29:09 I wish my dad taught me how to change breaks, oil, tires, etc. I want to be useful in the less traditional housewives manner.

9809 2018-03-01 01:26:33 I would but my hands are usually involved in things I would not eat (oil, grease, rust, dirt)
and the skin oils taste yucky.

I much prefer to chew on random objects, and my Pacifier when I can.
9810 2018-03-01 01:26:21 Applying the oil directly on the spot may help the pain especially
9811 2018-03-01 01:26:12 To not be bored while you’re getting your oil changed. Let’s go back to books.
9812 2018-03-01 01:26:09 ladies, life tip: 
shave using baby oil then afterwards moisturize with coconut oil.

9815 2018-03-01 01:25:27 @chrislhayes Many of what people assumed was funny from Trump were his plans or based on them. He had the nuclear plant in ME. He literally meant take the oil via pipelines. He did the embassy. He literally tells us what he will do. He is demanding the wall, still. He deported.
9816 2018-03-01 01:25:25 No he's not. President Trump wants guns taken away from mentally oil and criminals.  They will have due process.
9817 2018-03-01 01:24:59 Do your representatives ACTIVELY avoid you? Do they bring snipers to donor events and hire MAGA bikers with long arms to harass you all whilst promoting the Koch anti-union, anti-public education, agenda? Libertarianism is snake oil, hope you never need to dial 911
9818 2018-03-01 01:24:38 This is all about the oil and the sanctions...
9819 2018-03-01 01:24:32 อุ้ว

9822 2018-03-01 01:23:53 And I respect your opinion but Saddam didn’t threaten us, he threaten our allies that kept oil prices stable, Iran funded and trained terrorist groups that attacked and killed our own and still do it this day, I knew Marines that were killed in Beirut so I have no love for Irn
9823 2018-03-01 01:23:32 Yes, oil and coal are the energy sources of the future.

9869 2018-03-01 01:17:19 Unbelievable that it's only just started being built. Talk about decades late. Sabah and Sarawak have been neglected considering their contributions to Malaysia in oil and gas, palm oil and tourism revenues. Smh

9873 2018-03-01 01:16:52 Only “fact” is gas prices have increased! It’s only your opinion that #fracking won’t reduce them! US experience where #fracking caused world oil & gas prices to fall dramatically shows you’re clearly wrong!

9888 2018-03-01 01:15:18 this tweet and everything in this picture made possible by oil and gas. If your referring to solar and wind as #renewableenergy, u need to take a 2nd look. Can anyone tell me how many 100’s of litres of oil each wind turbine takes & changed 2-3 times/year? #greencapitalism
9889 2018-03-01 01:14:47 Put the heritage fund up as a down payment on an oil spill.
9890 2018-03-01 01:14:43 I don't think there is a clean future for oil/ gas companies. If there is, I'm sure they've saved enough, after making a killing over the years, to adapt rather quickly.
9891 2018-03-01 01:14:41 @quakes99 continues to deliver fierce and constant news feed on #uranium. Can this machine continue to keep the flow going until 2021 without stopping for an oil change / piston ring replacement? Who else is competing with what Quakes has been able to deliver? Well done.

9901 2018-03-01 01:13:19 Are we still talking about a gas tax here? I don't know what you mean I'm saying that a business (gas station/ oil company?) would have to improve to keep up with a tax on their product.
9902 2018-03-01 01:13:17 I bet it's because you tried that CBD oil, amirght? 
9903 2018-03-01 01:13:11 No, es un problema del país, por eso aclaro que no descubro el hilo negro, sin embargo, los mayores escándalos y los actores mas importantes de la corrupción son priistas. Saludos.

9923 2018-03-01 01:09:47 #Naftogaz wins? Yes, but in reality #Ukraine is deeply dependent on #Russia's gas & oil. Of course, Ukrainian #propaganda will tell us that Ukraine buys gas from #EU. In reality, that gas from EU is Russian. OMG. LOL

9926 2018-03-01 01:09:24 people paying $69million for a paper canvas with some oil paint brushed on it makes me question the world a lot more than people paying $10k for bitcoin. at least the latter has some use value.

9932 2018-03-01 01:07:58 Gabriel not afraid to perform an oil check
9933 2018-03-01 01:07:58 I think the only reason you say the things you do is bc you found a niche financial place for yourself in the conversation. I’m sure you’re conservative, but the pandering with “lefties” and “take our guns” is very transparent, the modern day snake oil is virtrol #fakenews #trump

9936 2018-03-01 01:07:35 Two things are to blame for the current situation.

Oil/Mineral excavation corporations

Crooked law makers in the corporate back pocket.

As the ol saying goes, money is the root of all evil

9972 2018-03-01 01:02:39 @realDonaldTrump Please reconsider the drilling for oil off the Atlantic. Many states rely on the coastal economy. Jobs will not happen for the locals, only the nomadic oil workers. Seismic testing will kill the sea life.

9979 2018-03-01 01:02:04 She got me in this Fancy farmers market they have all types of stuff I never heard of like different flavor honeys and olive oil stations I need to leave
9980 2018-03-01 01:02:02 Hold on. Let’s be reasonable. My husband works as a chef in oil/gas , exploration. His hob allowed me to stay home while our kids aren’t in full time school. It also allowed us to purchase a home. We live on Van Island.
9981 2018-03-01 01:02:01 Oh shit man, there's not enough water OR fat in them boys. Sugar is hygroscopic; it absorbs moisture like a sponge. The more sugar, the more liquid you need. In a regular recipe you get a lot of that from butter. Canola oil has zero water content

9984 2018-03-01 01:01:48 Leo and BonoWhy not move to Canada and pay our taxes while watching our Canadian  stock investments tank under this government as it triangles our oil industry.

10009 2018-03-01 00:57:33 The article mentions nothing about drug dealing. Infact it's quite light on detail other that to say it was for personal use. And you can buy cannabis oil in Holland & Barrett. It seems more that he didn't have a licence to make it x
