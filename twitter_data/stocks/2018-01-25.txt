54 2018-01-25 23:36:46 Over 250 companies are giving their employees bonuses races additional benefits stocks and so forth all I result of the Trump tax cut. It’s not trickling it’s flowing down to hard-working taxpaying Americans.
55 2018-01-25 23:35:46 I think we are having different conversations. Are you speaking of an inheritance tax? Plus I'd like for you to answer my questions. All money is taxed. Earned interest(intellectual labor) is taxed. Stocks can be gifted, but why are you such on that issue alone?
56 2018-01-25 23:35:42 Ditto with gold, correct? Gold seems to correlate perfectly with EM stocks. Could actually buy one rather than the other, no?
57 2018-01-25 23:35:38 @TSN_LouisB 2013 was a GREAT year for the markets! S&P was up 29.6%. The DOW up 26.5%. The Q up 38%! If you owned Netflix & Best Buy you made a tonne of cash! If you owned gold or gold stocks, you lost your shirt!
58 2018-01-25 23:35:10 That's a good thing. See how stocks are doing
59 2018-01-25 23:35:05 See it's not about headlines, and this is ultimately where Hillary failed, 50% of Americans don't have stocks, and really less than 5% care what the market is doing day to day, it's there for retirement. But what Americans do see is their HC costs rising,temp work,fewer benefits

66 2018-01-25 23:31:34 If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. It's the worst possible thing you can do, because people are so sensitive to short-term losses. If you count your money every day, you'll be miserable.

129 2018-01-25 22:41:24 I am a ex trawler skipper, Bass stocks are dangerously low, French trawlers have done a lot off damage to stocks here off the SW ..Getting our fishing grounds back and putting a good exclusion zone around our country would be a good start for fishermen and anglers.
130 2018-01-25 22:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
131 2018-01-25 22:40:16 So it fluctuates just like stocks based on how much is out at a given time. Its not regulated so it can go high and low and no one will know the true price.
132 2018-01-25 22:40:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing stocks.
133 2018-01-25 22:35:49 C’mon dude... stocks WAY sexier! 

Stocks give us swing trading, straddles, bull call spreads... get hot just saying the words.

And what does $BTC give us? - Forks.

I ain’t getting hot & bothered over cutlery.
134 2018-01-25 22:35:48 It's amazing, isn't it. This Mr. Coyle was once promoting cannabis stocks (where he lost an awful amount of money). Now he's all about crypto. Tesla is just a side bet I guess

148 2018-01-25 22:29:36 President Trump is growing the economy so company stocks are doing much better now.  These stocks affect your 401K, that is why your 401K is doing better. If Hillary had won you would be crying instead now!

154 2018-01-25 22:26:20 When I say stocks in the OTC are unpredictable sometimes and you never know if or when a catalyst will come, that just proved my point today and also with HAON this week, I've had those for months as personal lottos, But i'm always thankful when they do move that's for sure >

157 2018-01-25 22:25:34 @RubinReport Number now up to 250 companies offering bonuses, stocks, benefits, pay increases thanks to the tax reform.
158 2018-01-25 22:25:25 as i just responded to Spicer, why did 2017 have the worst job rate growth since 2010?  Trump has managed not to kill a robust economy he inherited.  Unemployment was already going way down, jobs were already up, stocks were already up...etc.  Oh, and we are in Syria for longer
159 2018-01-25 22:25:24 bonuses are NOT wage increases-these nominal bonuses prove the fact tha a majority of tax breaks will go to buyback stocks-keep trying to spin
160 2018-01-25 22:24:29 Today weakening dollar affected currency market, treasuries, mortgage interest rates, mortgage REIT stocks. Then when TRUMP walked back Mnuchin STUPID comment, dollar rebounded. SO their STUPID lack of economic knowledge affected us all.
161 2018-01-25 22:24:25 What a joke! You say, 1k is allowing them to invest in home improvements, car maintenance, buy stocks, and take their families on vacations.  What planet do you live on? It freaking allows them to sleep the night before rent is due. Once. One time only. That is all.
162 2018-01-25 22:23:58 Our stocks are up and we associates will recieve a bonus. Is this the greatest company or what??
163 2018-01-25 22:22:40 Heard this with Play Anywhere, and we know developers we're keen on that. They need that big bump in initial sales, their stocks depend on it. Can't "Hope" for something and a small percent up front from MS. Makes no sense.
164 2018-01-25 22:22:37 Do u have any left handed thumb hole stocks?
165 2018-01-25 22:22:18 Remember when you got into bonds instead of stocks?

169 2018-01-25 22:20:39 True. Let's just make bump stocks a tax stamp thing then maybe
170 2018-01-25 22:20:08 Dollar needs to stay on the low end of range, for stocks, commodities and real estate to keep rallying. As long as it is at the low end of present range, daily fluctuations don’t mean much Tyler.

174 2018-01-25 22:17:40 How would it ruin wwe?  Worst case is Vince sells more stocks to pay for xfl.  Maybe stocks take a hit from association, but he's not using wwe to invest in xfl this time.
175 2018-01-25 22:16:41 Je comprends. Manque d’éthique. Des stocks insuffisants , des bagarres. On a plus parlé de Nutella que d’Inter qui a joué avec le feu. Reste à savoir si celui qui a pris l’initiative sera félicité ou réprimandé...
176 2018-01-25 22:15:23 I get that, but this is where these stats can be misleading. For example, I know people who loaded up on tech stocks in 1990 and never sold them. Entry price of $10. 10 years later price hits $100. 1 year after that, price is back to $10 again. Zero drawdown.

183 2018-01-25 22:11:19 Hi #investors. The Canadian weed stocks I recommended might be very very over-valued. Please don't tweet curse words at me.
184 2018-01-25 22:11:10 I agree that this seems highly suspicious. My feeling is they have a lot of access two opportunities because people are constantly making them aware of what's going on. Most aren't scrutinizing enough whether what they do is an inside deal others can't. See Pruitt's stocks.
185 2018-01-25 22:11:06 Good you are not.. I am a long term investor and everytime earnings are announced.. I burn my hand.. I will be out of $SBUX and $ual soon.. Big Disappointment in both the stocks.

193 2018-01-25 22:05:52 If you're not talking about stocks and ownership, you're missing the core of the problem. Salaries are only a problem at very high levels, like CEOs, who often get hired/fired for nepotism, politics, or other reasons unrelated to performance.

195 2018-01-25 22:02:10 Part of the reason for #US stock rally is higher CAPE ratio resulting from
1)higher rate of share repurchases
2)stronger fear about the replacement of jobs by machines. 3)stronger desire to own capital in a free-market country with an association with computers. #stocks #markets

200 2018-01-25 22:00:17 USDA-ERS @USDA_ERS; The wheat export projection for Russia is up 2.0 million tons this month to 35.0 million, as increased production, large stocks, and policies push the export projection further into uncharted territory

204 2018-01-25 21:57:10 I'm really moving to view that selling good Stocks in uptrends is silly. I think we actually decide to Sell and then think up a rational and reasoned justification  (excuse more like) ;-)

210 2018-01-25 21:54:03 USDA-ERS @USDA_ERS; A projected reduction in wheat supplies exceeds a small consumption decline, such that estimates for ending stocks are down
211 2018-01-25 21:53:51 USDA-ERS @USDA_ERS; The projected expansion of world wheat production is more than offset by lower beginning stocks stemming from the 2016/17 production cut for Australia

232 2018-01-25 21:47:51 Sometimes you have to do a bit of research to find the good stocks, those who do get in early.  It’s not too late yet but won’t be long before #TLOU turns itself into a midcap producer.  Likely to be one of the few AIM success stories.  Fundamentally it all stacks up! 
233 2018-01-25 21:47:01 I’m sure many of them own stocks and privately celebrate their earnings.

235 2018-01-25 21:46:23 Got a few ideas, but nothing I'm nearly as confident about as IVITF. Here's the method: find stocks <$500m market cap, trading at low price/book-value, with non-negligible revs, then look at business model to project revs. You'll see who's over- & under- valued.
236 2018-01-25 21:46:09 I'm not jaded. At least I don't think I am.

I just don't respect those who don't want put in effort - researching stocks and managing a portfolio is definitely work.

I think the reason I disrespect cryptoland is that "the old world doesn't get *me*" is an excuse for laziness.

On avg though it is in the realm of reasonable expectations when in relatively concentrated portfolio of leading stocks. The outperformance over time makes it worth it.
257 2018-01-25 21:35:36 @CNBCClosingBell @KellyEvansCNBC: We all know Airlines stocks are volatile. The recent surge in oil price is bound to have an impact!!!!
258 2018-01-25 21:35:23 They are. We got tax cuts, too. A plus is that the business's are giving to employees, some w/ higher wages, bonuses, stocks. Looks like a win win all the way around. Why are ppl complaining?
259 2018-01-25 21:35:19 Just went ahead and closed my Microsoft stocks aswell 
260 2018-01-25 21:34:59 Suck. Nivån på den artikeln:
"At a little under $4, GLUU stock is certainly the cheapest among the featured video game stocks"
261 2018-01-25 21:34:58 The top five most active stocks today were $F, $GE, $NWL, $BAC, and $AMD.
262 2018-01-25 21:34:35 Unfortunately they're also not stocks
263 2018-01-25 21:32:21 $SBUX down $WDC down in after hours following big sell offs in CPG stocks and airlines- is the market getting tired? Expectations too high?

265 2018-01-25 21:31:20 Almost 75% of Americans work for companies that offer 401k's. And about 35% of Americans have 401k's. So there are lots of folks that could/should have stocks but choose not to. Still awfully good news for the smart ones that do.

267 2018-01-25 21:31:14 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-24, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (2/6):
268 2018-01-25 21:31:12 Dollar Turns Higher on Trump Backing; Stocks Mixed /articles/2018-01-25/asian-stocks-head-lower-as-davos-talk-roils-dollar-markets-wrap
269 2018-01-25 21:31:08 I do my own DD and never look at anyone for validation. Twitter is sometimes good for sharing ideas, or scanning stocks, but all buying and selling is my own decision.
270 2018-01-25 21:31:02 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière, que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien, que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines, que tu me dises que c'est rien.
271 2018-01-25 21:29:37 Keep your funds securely fastened as airline stocks continue to fall, and than make your move and buckle your seat belt. We all love to hate the airlines, but after the cable/internet industry it is the closest thing America has to a modern-day monopoly.
272 2018-01-25 21:29:36 There's a very good reason... My health insurance stocks would tank 
273 2018-01-25 21:28:59 In the short-term stocks can move quickly in either direction. Falling stocks don't mean that a company is problematic and rising stocks don't mean that a company is a good investment. You need confidence in the quality of your stock selections in order to survive the volatility.
274 2018-01-25 21:28:42 Since the appetite for risk is so insatiable, there should be an ETN comprising of random #cryptocurrencies (#Doge, #Bitcoin, #ethereum, #kodakcoin), #blockchain (ice tea) related stocks, and #WEEDSTOCKS. We'll call it #YoloSwaggins ETN, cause why TF not? #ETFs #ETN #Finance
275 2018-01-25 21:27:42 So glad I invested in tin foil stocks the day of the election.  I'm sitting pretty with all you Trump cultist dandruff flakes and your MAGA tin foil hats.
276 2018-01-25 21:27:30 I agree with your thoughts on valuation, one example that came to mind is how they used to use P/E ratios to value stocks, but now the best performing stocks have “ridiculous” PE ratios, showing new/evolving methods for valuation.
277 2018-01-25 21:27:16 Hate those hip stocks.. lol
278 2018-01-25 21:27:05 Love it, you can buy stocks without commissions and i got an email today that coming in February you can buy crypto
279 2018-01-25 21:27:03 Fam. This is huge. Robin Hood is adding various cryptos—no fees and more of a brokerage purchase process. That plus stocks.. im swapping over immediately. @m1keyb @DillEsq @brantleynicole @mkeez @ADH702
280 2018-01-25 21:26:02 Fuck these stocks they fluctuate too much jus cant trust em
Fuck these thots they lie to much jus wanna fuck them
Ooo
No he didnt
Yes i did it
Ball like scotty
In the lobby
Made Victoria tell any and everybody
Took a trip
And left my body
No time to trip
So i tote my broccoli
281 2018-01-25 21:25:50 Well, that's arguable but I guess you have a point. When the amount of crimes that match that description rises above 1 we can talk about banning the stocks. I'm just trying to air on the side of not setting a precedent for restricting firearm rights.

284 2018-01-25 21:25:10 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-24, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
285 2018-01-25 21:24:20 As more reports of various bubbles within US economics come up, more canaries singing out, 2 things occur to me. 

1) I wouldn't want $ in stocks or traditional investments right now.

2) I wouldn't want to not have $ in cryptos BEFORE a stock crash.
286 2018-01-25 21:23:20 In my generation it's tech stocks. Like Nortel.
287 2018-01-25 21:22:46 Do you use their platform for stocks?
288 2018-01-25 21:22:30 make it a day interval like the other one yo. its def startin to break out. most of the weed stocks have killed it since monday, though everything kinda tanked in the latter half of the day today. i wonder if the coin will feel the same effect
289 2018-01-25 21:22:17 Stock hit 52-week low today... yield 4.22%.... analysts cite prospect of rising interest rates... National Bank's Patrick Kenny says low U.S. dollar hurts value of U.S. cash flows. "Not to mention risk-on rotation with many investors switching into smaller, higher growth stocks"
290 2018-01-25 21:21:19 US stocks not sign of strength. Due to cannibalization.
291 2018-01-25 21:20:42 I think if you don’t have fine examples of slow and steady investment working out (parents etc) you will rush towards more aggressive ways to make more money (penny stocks, cryptos) out the gate.
292 2018-01-25 21:20:06 is this starting to become penny stocks? Scams, upon scams?
293 2018-01-25 21:19:51 They've definitely lagged the whole way up which makes me think it's time for energy stocks to outperform now and catch up with wti, which it may start doing on a pullback.

296 2018-01-25 21:19:08 For corporations to express political views is suicide. The CEO should be voted off the board immediately. In the mean time I’m going to watch their stocks drop.

299 2018-01-25 21:16:52 Negative people just want cheaper shares. That trick is as old as the market itself. Negative chatter is sign of a stocks that is alive with potential. Who knows, one day they could very well get caught off guard and be without a position at the wrong time!  $SEGI
300 2018-01-25 21:16:06 the people Dalio and others are calling stupid for hiding cash to go out and buy stocks from here
301 2018-01-25 21:14:37 I wonder if you have to report your gains in Korea? I heard exchanges’ fee covers the taxes and individuals don’t have to separately report their yearly gains just like securities in stocks. Am I correct? @iamjosephyoung
302 2018-01-25 21:14:24 Bill loaded his fund with financial stocks in 2007 after they fell 10%. He thought they were the bargain of a lifetime. Just saying.
303 2018-01-25 21:14:15 US stocks end the session mixed. Dow/S
304 2018-01-25 21:13:50 US stocks eke out gain; rest of world lower: S&P 500 +.1%; Europe -.6%. Stocks may not yet be "priced for perfection;" however, they are at the upper end of realistic. Odds are earnings & momentum will prevail but if there's a downturn it may cascade to a 5% pullback.
305 2018-01-25 21:13:50 They’ve been right before and chart looks solid. Heavy call buying in $MLCO as well casino and gaming stocks seeing bullish option flow

307 2018-01-25 21:13:16 3 stocks with highest potential for growth investors in 2018  (My opinion) 
1. Netflix(NFLX)
2. MindBody Inc (MB)
3. Entegris, Inc. ( ENTG )

308 2018-01-25 21:12:55 Stocks end mixed, hit by fresh weakness in airlines, autos, some retail. Dow +0.5% but Nasdaq off fractionally, S&P flat.

310 2018-01-25 21:12:43 "You know how I knew to get out? When I was getting my shoes shined, the shoeshine guy was telling me what stocks to get". 
When everybody is thinking "I should get in now, while it's still early", that's the sign that it's too late.
311 2018-01-25 21:12:26 Self Note:

Very hard to sell stock a few days earlier and then buying them back at higher price.

Qudian Inc - market hated it for a short while and now that warm investor glow is back. 

Bought back 1/3rd position. 

Similar task necessary for 1 or 2 other stocks.

Never easy!
312 2018-01-25 21:12:22 WATCH: KBW CEO Tom Michaud discuss financial stocks, the overall market, and the impact of recent political & economic events on banks. Tomorrow morning at 11am ET on @FoxBusiness @Varneyco.
313 2018-01-25 21:12:01 The NRA fights any gun control, facilitates school shootings, supports bump stocks used for mass murder and oh yes, assisted in the Russia collusion during the 2016 election. So un-American! #resist
314 2018-01-25 21:11:58 If they stick to the top 10-20 then there’s little risk for them.

They also don’t list penny stocks so they’re already disciplined in that sense.

No one who uses coinbase likes them as a company, but robinhood has a huge fan base.
315 2018-01-25 21:11:45 Not all stocks are up. Only the biggest most wealthy companies are up. Small businesses are going to crap.
316 2018-01-25 21:11:15 $CCXI vs $TYME after today's opposite price movement, those two stocks have almost same market cap, but $TYME should be only valued a fraction of $CCXI no matter how you view from 1) cash, 2) pipeline, 3) science, 4) partnership; 5) preliminary pIb data on pancreatic cancer.
317 2018-01-25 21:10:37 Gold is not a stock though. Yet bitcoin behaves more like gold. I think there are maybe 3 asset classes, there are crypto stocks, crypto stores (bitcoin), crypto currencies

319 2018-01-25 21:10:26 As airline stocks continue their descent due to an impeding price war, hold off on buying them for now. With oil reaching $70/barrel, there will be more pressure to airline's bottom lines in the short term. $UAL $LUV $AAL

322 2018-01-25 21:09:31 to me looks like they are rotating the crap out of the GDX index listed stocks. Dump some rally others and dump those and rally others.  Crazy period thats for sure.
323 2018-01-25 21:09:30 I c u have some crypto in your profile but r advocating STOCK OWNERSHIP??? Stocks have about as much intrinsic value as coins do which is basically NOTHING but paper certificates. If u want ownership buy physical gold/silver or property/land...CRYPTOS might be 2 risky 4u
324 2018-01-25 21:09:22 Je reste convaincu qu'on en trouvera encore d'ici un mois. Sauf erreur, beaucoup de collectors, dont nous n'étions pas sûrs des stocks /dispos, étaient en rupture day one et finalement, pas tant sur ça ... Non ?

331 2018-01-25 21:07:30 So apart from the fact that I doubt you have ever been near fishing industry...
1) without the EU quotas, we would not have any fish stocks, plus the fishermen sold their quotas themselves (mainly to the Dutch)
2) no idea what you are on about
3) that literally is how tax works

386 2018-01-25 20:49:17 $LTBR really looks like they used this stock as a test stock to experiment with their algos seriously.  Not even in right now just watching for entertainment but this shows you how manipulated stocks can really get.

389 2018-01-25 20:47:26 No, not “all on paper”.

Net current assets = cash and stocks

Benefit so far to holders is they’ve not lost everything and now looks like the company is on course for a comeback.

393 2018-01-25 20:45:31 The only time I get jealous and bitter is if the Stock Market is up and my stocks are down.  
394 2018-01-25 20:44:44 probably 38.38, then 38.18. But I'm watching 37 as my target before I decide to do any buying (individual stocks). That 38.18 definitely might be worthy of an intraday try long on the XOP if the situation is right.

403 2018-01-25 20:40:49 While CNN's headline is misleading, your comment is also not correct. Folks who received wealth based on stocks going up are earned, but the shareholders didn't "create" it either.
404 2018-01-25 20:40:15 Soit, des stocks trop haut, vendus un peu plus du prix d'achat,

420 2018-01-25 20:33:51 Not related to stocks but the XFL press conference was an amazing spectacle. This should be good for some entertainment one way or another.
421 2018-01-25 20:33:34 If stocks drop, the investor loses money. If crypto drops, and people have bought it on credit, both the investor and the lender lose money. They're "so negative" because the article is written from the view of a lender, not an investor
422 2018-01-25 20:32:54 Yea the @RobinhoodApp announcement is really big. Being able to coin and invest in stocks (vice versa) is a really awesome combo. Not to mention commission free.

429 2018-01-25 20:29:14 I never said I am in favor of allowing crypto to be bought on credit card, in fact, I think it’s a bad idea. The problem I have with the article/statement is how they’re so negative about a price drop leading to loss of money, when traditional stocks carry a huge risk as well

438 2018-01-25 20:27:09 He sold $100 million worth of his wwe stocks to bring back the league under a different promotional company that has nothing to do with wwe. Nobody in their right mind would sell their shares from a company to pay employees cuz it’s his money not company money
439 2018-01-25 20:26:47 Exactly. So anything above .0008 means the risk/reward is no longer in favor of the buyer. I NEVER chase stocks up 500% already but in this case the exception was obvious because it still had room to run before the market properly values the stock.
440 2018-01-25 20:26:38 A Bitcoin ETF might be the actual worst idea I've ever heard. It would be like having an ETF for the Euro or the USD. These ain't stocks people, they are currencies. Own the underlying or own nothing.

443 2018-01-25 20:25:02 Big success speculating comes down to trade management. Trade light during good times and heavy during tough times and you could actually lose money being in the right stocks.
444 2018-01-25 20:23:59 Yea from wolf of penny stocks
445 2018-01-25 20:23:50 Just like FX or stocks. Various of:

1. Hidden in bid-ask spread 
2. Funding charges if leveraged 
3. Interest on deposits 
4. Payment to market makers for order flow
5. Rolls

It’s a bit icky tbh - unsophisticated consumers just see ‘no fee’ but there’s never a free lunch …
446 2018-01-25 20:23:42 1. Never chase juniors 
2. sell half or 1/3rd if it doubles so you are playing with the houses money
3. don't worry that will happen to stocks like BA and MMM soon enough

525 2018-01-25 19:57:42 Investor and in my investing experience for last few years, growth stocks perform much better. I’ve made 400% + on Aurora in about 1 year. I’m not pulling my money out yet either as they are investing and positioning themselves to be the world leader in marijuana and already
526 2018-01-25 19:57:41 Judiciary Committee already moved to opponents on bump stock ban bill (LB780). First up is Brian Gosch, lobbyist for National Rifle Association, who says bill too broad and could affect use of bump stocks for competition or people w/disabilities who use for sporting or hunting.
527 2018-01-25 19:56:36 Oh good, mine too, 401k, IRA, stocks, Acorn and Christmas club, lol

That's fine, because I expect Gold to hit 1600,after retesting 1233/1190 range. Trump can't stop stocks from crashing

652 2018-01-25 19:05:19 We tend not to look at the bigger picture of the tweet and jump into guessing and suggesting our favorite stocks. There are many stocks but ideas are few.
653 2018-01-25 19:04:21 Goody for you, I was a day-trader myself in the 90's and know what happened back then.  It's called stocks and funds going sky high without basis.  In other words, Fake Worth.  It's all an illusion of worth.  It will crash at some point.
654 2018-01-25 19:03:38 Over both Obama’s first term and entire eight-year term, U.S. stocks gained significantly more than average and significantly bested international stocks. In other words, stocks supported both the “Make America great” and “America first” dimensions for U.S. companies.

656 2018-01-25 19:03:16 We get  tons of sms on regular basis for crappy stocks such as - 'Saibaba' and 'Funny Software' etc. I wonder why arent these 'Hard Working people' doing anything about these? instead of talking illogical about the cos which are actually doing good !!!

658 2018-01-25 19:03:05 Here’s how us uneducated blue collar work force see it; we haven had substantial wage increases since the Clinton Years. The weekend dollar will cut deep into our weekly expenses. 

Weaker dollar means stocks go down. Business want to buy back their stocks thus they get their way

669 2018-01-25 18:57:16 is not that the stocks doesn’t matter, is just that the stocks and perks are already there. the others are subjects to make improvements on.

703 2018-01-25 18:43:29 We owe it to victims, survivors, & everyone impacted to continue researching ways to address mass shootings at a federal level.   Banning bump stocks & ghost guns won’t get to the core of the problem, but it will be a step in the right direction.

707 2018-01-25 18:42:14 @rhum01 I like your general overview on stocks that said can I ask for your opinion on what you feel will be a better stock to invest in FAT or PKG?
708 2018-01-25 18:41:57 After talking to gun owners, I believe that we must ban bump stocks & ghost guns. As you’ll remember, bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas mass murder in October. Congress must ban parts that are used exclusively in converting a weapon into a machine gun.  #bumpstockban
709 2018-01-25 18:41:47 We have to follow certain stocks in groups for my finance class. The group with the highest return at the end of the quarter "gets a 6 pack of your favorite beverage" hah my Prof is cool

711 2018-01-25 18:41:42 The problem are the stupid investors! They sell on every fact, wether stocks with Phantasie and no information often show a better run. The decrease of the stock makes no sense to me. I hope that after the 31. we experience a better time.

714 2018-01-25 18:40:35 Investing is a forward looking game. Expensive stocks don't stay expensive forever and cheap stocks don't stay cheap forever. Trust your process and have courage in your convictions. The performance will follow and your clients will learn to trust you as well.

717 2018-01-25 18:38:04 Further to pithy headline suggesting investing in 'boring old stocks' as opposed to a nonsense vehicle, does that mean 'boring old companies' that fuel economies and create jobs, as well as providing investors above average rates of returns?

The internet can be such nonsense.

720 2018-01-25 18:36:23 Gold is a different story. Because although gold usually rises when the US dollar falters gold value has in matter fact risen allowing stocks and funds related to gold to be opened up and shared

722 2018-01-25 18:34:27 one final example... a VIX short ETP has ~4-5x the vol as stocks over time. i would often rather own 10% of that and 90% cash than 50% stocks as the most i can lose is 10% in a period, while i can lose more in stocks. even better, now i have more to play with for alpha strategies

727 2018-01-25 18:33:00 And what about "bump stocks?" Suppose a large number of people got killed in an open setting because a wacko fired from a window using one of those? Wouldn't common sense indicate that they should be made illegal?
728 2018-01-25 18:32:33 Safest way of investing passively is just putting your money into index funds and mutual funds. You'll see on average 6-10% returns. The risk with that is you may miss out on earning 25% - 35% or even more by choosing not to invest in indivual stocks. More risk more reward.

741 2018-01-25 18:25:04 You completely miss the point. It's not about bump stocks. But if they ATF can regulate bump stocks, then they can regulate triggers, magazines, or anything they deem to "increase the rate of fire."
742 2018-01-25 18:24:34 Define convert, because you’ve been implying bump stocks. Either way reread my last posts, if that’s not too hard.

745 2018-01-25 18:24:05 I was referring to make sensible gun laws like banning bump stocks and assault rifles that can murder so many in a few minutes. I, personally, have no problem with guns that sportsman use. My father was a gunsmith and owned many shotguns.
746 2018-01-25 18:24:01 So,  i guess AT&T can't pay their dividend pay outs.  They owed me about $1000 sent me the checks then when i deposited them they waited weeks and withdrew them from my account with a no payment.  To make it worse i get charged $24 for checks returned.   Shame on AT&T stocks.

777 2018-01-25 18:13:14 "They" said IF Trump got elected, #Gold would skyrocket, #Stocks would crash terribly. Well, things just take time...Gold is creeping up, Stocks WILL have a correction, they always do. #Cycles.
778 2018-01-25 18:12:37 Often when I talk 2 people about Stocks, Investing, Start ups, etc they ALWAYS ask the wrong question how did yu learn that" & Ima bitch so I tell them the human brain consists of special cells called neurons, some are brain fibers known as dendrites & as yu learn the fibers grow
779 2018-01-25 18:11:24 Just the fact that you can trade crypto AND buy stocks in the same app is HUGE for the crypto space. Much improve. Such opportunity. Many Doge.
780 2018-01-25 18:11:09 /2 as of right now this thing is like playing penny stocks. Super super risky.
781 2018-01-25 18:11:06 Central Banks own those bonds, the public owns stocks.  The public will eventually have to eat their losses, the central banks won't...big difference.
782 2018-01-25 18:10:45 Was gonna get a sim racing setup bit there isn't a store on earth that actually stocks half the things they say they do 
783 2018-01-25 18:10:11 Really excited for @RobinhoodApp to start offering $crypto. Being able to trade $crypto and invest in #stocks in the same app is HUGE.
784 2018-01-25 18:09:51 I stopped using @RobinhoodApp to move from stocks to cryptocurrencies. Will you be able to implement direct trading of altcoins with fiat currency?
785 2018-01-25 18:09:46 What about DACA? Tax cuts only help those with stocks and investments. They did nothing for me so stop spreading lies. #GOPCantGovern #GOPTaxScam
786 2018-01-25 18:08:33 Ask Carrier about jobs lost...world economy doing great after depression..Japan higher % increase in stocks since 2017!
787 2018-01-25 18:08:09 BioTech Market Color from STAT: The Nasdaq #Biotechnology Index is ripping higher, leaving investors with little choice but to chase stocks for performance. #SolidBiosciences upsized its IPO, #Ultragenyx & #AdamasPharmaceuticals priced secondary offerings with aggressive premiums
788 2018-01-25 18:07:42 Best of all world in 2018 ... stocks up and Trump on way to jail.
789 2018-01-25 18:07:24 Scottrade is TD Ameritrade at least on paper now.
Well I just won't be able to buy and DTC chill stocks.
But it is what it is. Yup. ETRADE is the one to use.

792 2018-01-25 18:06:42 This is super exciting news! Bought my first stocks on the Robinhood App - sold all my stocks and moved into Crypto. I can't wait to purchase crypto with Robinhood. These guys get it
793 2018-01-25 18:06:41 I already have robinhood account for stocks and it's a very legit company and they need your social because they issue you tax forms in the end of the year to file your earnings.
794 2018-01-25 18:06:20 For the same reason they pay asset managers to buy listed stocks  No?
795 2018-01-25 18:06:19 TRUMP BRAGS ABOUT TANKING HEALTH INSURANCE STOCKS.
796 2018-01-25 18:05:51 Only stock in my portfolio which is a punt. Purely technical basis it becomes a buy above 115. On fundamental basis very few stocks below 20 pe. Srikalasthi, talwalkar etc. And sadly value stocks not running.
797 2018-01-25 18:05:44 so... is owning bonds market timing? i would say yes to a certain extent as you are making a bet that stocks will return ~5% less than their historical average just to break even on a shift from bonds to stocks
798 2018-01-25 18:05:18 This is by far my favourite flavoured gin and I keep telling my gin friends they have to try it! My local pub stocks it.

826 2018-01-25 17:51:43 The way I understand it trying to short a  cannabis stock will cost you a 20% premium. That's why there are so few shorters and the stocks are still seeing an mass #Exodus
827 2018-01-25 17:50:14 WHAT?YOURE an idiot!401ks!STOCKS!ECONOMY!JOBS!LOOKS LIKE HES DOING JUST FINE!It must be killing you that were doing so good under HIM!Youre yr old Russia sideshow hasnt meant a damn thing!
828 2018-01-25 17:49:43 Okay..if u recall under pine tree he hid the true value of man of his losers with a ridiculous claim that private stocks could not be valued properly.
829 2018-01-25 17:49:33 yea, and investing my money in different stocks and bonds. so it's doing good things, ive already made $7 in 20 mins lol so its cool

832 2018-01-25 17:47:12 The local mass consumption can be said to be linked to the current peak without the trading of stocks and foreign trade
833 2018-01-25 17:45:53 I think people are bailing out to chase other stocks that are running like...... $SX and $IDK SMH

836 2018-01-25 17:44:50 I order that Barry Stocks get into the WBB Hall of Fame.  He is a total winner and the home run king. Maybe he took a couple steroids.  But if you're not cheating then you're not trying!

841 2018-01-25 17:43:29 Again, you misconstrue, or outright lie, or have a comprehension issue. Bump FIRING (using a belt loop or rubber band or loosely holding) a gun is more dangerous for the shooter and those around than BUMP STOCKS.

844 2018-01-25 17:42:18 @DougPolkPoker what are your thoughts on crypto mining company stocks?  is this something you have looked at/invested in.  $hive and $kash for example...   big fan, keep up the good work

849 2018-01-25 17:40:40 More like Cryptobets 

Stocks imply some kind of onus on the company to comply with law to take your money and that price would move in line with performance.

856 2018-01-25 17:38:56 buying netflix stocks in 2010 was my best decision
857 2018-01-25 17:38:24 That started up a couple years ago on the stock markets. Other than the flash-crash a couple years back, the battle bots of stocks have faded into the background. We're seeing a lot of hype over alleged #AI threats, but nothing solid yet. #IDGTechTalk
858 2018-01-25 17:38:19 Tax cuts could boost US stocks EPS by 5-6%. Clear beneficiaries are US companies with high tax rates, such as telecoms, retail & small caps. International sectors like IT likely to benefit least. (HSBC) #stocks #investing #taxcuts

865 2018-01-25 17:36:05 It would be ironical if the market (stocks + consumer preferences) led the way past oil and coal and cars and current construction. It would happen. The future depends on cyber and its enlargement to affect infrastructure more than superficially as now. Two USA's.

871 2018-01-25 17:34:23 Correlation, I know. Do u think the market cares? No, Is FOMO rally, any logic is out the window.

880 2018-01-25 17:30:24 $SPY mid day is when I sell bull put spreads on beta stocks, "buying" this dip, weekly's exp tmrw so taking advantage of theta as the time bleeds, usually shoot for $1 credit, works well for $TSLA, $BIDU, $CMG, $AMZN, $NDVA, $SPX, $RUT, $GS, $PCLN, $BA
881 2018-01-25 17:30:06 That's what they do ... even the folks without money will tell you how great the economy is doing (that really isn't benefitting them) - but they "win" politically??? by yelling it at "opposition." Meanwhile ... only 50% of Americans own stocks &
28% of bottom half owns stocks.
882 2018-01-25 17:30:03 Have you not read of the company's giving employees Thousands upon thousands in bonuses and stocks. Most recent? Your liberal friends at "Starbucks" even contribute to the tax cuts
883 2018-01-25 17:30:00 @HalftimeReport Guys, love the show, but BA and CAT are way above their long term P/E averages. A return to normal-ish would put them close to half their current prices, & stocks very often return to normal.  BA at 340 and CAT at 170 seem like very risky buys for your viewers.

898 2018-01-25 17:26:30 If businesses, individuals and investors decide not to utilize the US dollar, its value will also inevitably fall. Most stocks, there is no intrinsic value because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks #BTC
899 2018-01-25 17:26:04 thats a pathetic argument as all great growth stocks historically have defied p/e and value gravity.

909 2018-01-25 17:22:37 Bolt action hunting rifles and shotguns would handle the vast majority of use cases that aren't murder.

Semi-automatic rifles and handguns, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, armor piercing rounds, and all this extra crap isn't necessary or even useful for anything else
910 2018-01-25 17:22:30 Home Depot (HD) up 206.00 Wholly smokes! I dated a guy years ago who worked at HD. Stocks were given to Employees as a benefit bonus. 39.00 at the time with quite a few splits in between. Eventually rose to 73.00 which he cashed out 7 years of owning. Imagine that now.
911 2018-01-25 17:22:27 +65% profits on my stocks, neighbor paid me nicely to help move some furniture, FEMA sent me an email inviting me to stay two days paid in Houston next month for training, waitr promotion, all before 10:30, nice morning 
912 2018-01-25 17:22:11 $TWTR inside day so far. Watch for reversal here as stock rests near the 50 day moving average. #stocks #trading
913 2018-01-25 17:21:41 You just described 70% of the stocks under $5 =0)  Not too worried about that Zakk.  Check what OPGN (equal dilution machine did) Post R/S
914 2018-01-25 17:21:26 Every year doing my taxes on TurboTax I feel like they think I’m a fake person. No kids, property, school, military, car, wife, stocks, medical expenses. I end up clicking no to everything other the gender type and race lol. I feel like I should get award for being so uninvolved
915 2018-01-25 17:21:08 Thank you Representative @SteveShurtleff  for your #gunsense and  co-sponsoring SB 492 Prohibiting Bump Stocks.
916 2018-01-25 17:20:23 because a good guy with a fast car isn't going to catch a bad guy with a fast car.
and you aim to make it so only bad guys have bump stocks, semi autos and the likes.
kind of like how the bad guys in europe are the only ones lobbing grenades. (because they're illegal...)
917 2018-01-25 17:20:10 il faut arrêter de faire des pubs avec des énormes encarts s'il n'y a pas de stocks ! ils font espérer et déplacer les gens, idem à Carrefour avec une nitendo switch à Noël en méga promo, il n'y en avait qu'une ! bref c'est une honte !
918 2018-01-25 17:18:42 Just narrow down your universe to the DOW 30 Stocks and then narrow it down further to $DIA
919 2018-01-25 17:18:41 gotta start investing in some stocks
920 2018-01-25 17:18:24 then I am even more glad he got banned, because doxers should be placed in the public stocks and pelted with old vegetables and new shit.
921 2018-01-25 17:18:16 Hello sir, any good stocks in Agriculture theme
922 2018-01-25 17:18:09 Stocks looking good. Looks like I've made a good $200 in two days. Keep that up @Microsoft 
923 2018-01-25 17:17:55 i typed in about 100 symbols of stocks that reported last week & this week & put them on a 5 day chart and most of them are at the lows of the range. Bump that to 2/3 and it moves to the mid range. The remaining are at the highs of the 5 days. How robust are earnings anyways?
924 2018-01-25 17:17:47 Need to invest more in that 401k now. #stocks
925 2018-01-25 17:17:38 @SenSchumer don’t sign a budget until bump stocks are banned!
926 2018-01-25 17:17:17 Why can't you keep your guns, use them to protect your property? or to hunt, as long as licensed, yet ban assault rifles and bump stocks? No more keeping them in your cars or person,. No crossing state lines. 2a safe, ppl safe. Win win
927 2018-01-25 17:16:39 The “economy” isn’t just about stocks.  It’s a combination of several factors. Job growth was the lowest in the previous 6 years and wages were lower last year.  Those two factors reflect the economy much more than Stocks that only 40% of Americans possess.
928 2018-01-25 17:16:07 I agree brother.  There are plenty of liars that will even take your money monthly to give you alerts on stocks they bought 10% ago
929 2018-01-25 17:15:42 Not much "green" today:  TMXN .01 +25%....PAOG .006 +22%....EHVVF .08 +14%....INMG .011 +2%....ACOL .017 up a tad....BUT...my MJ list shows 15 stocks up 36 down and that's the main reason many are weak today imho.
930 2018-01-25 17:14:46 No tardaremos en ver la solución... voy dentro, espero que rompa por arriba,si no, stoploss y fuera 
931 2018-01-25 17:14:32 $NFLX don’t ever confuse a bull market for brains... but some of you fail to see the obvious time and time again. Stocks are melting UP $DIA
932 2018-01-25 17:14:08 I thought they actually invest in purchased stocks (I think that have to from a regulatory reason) as directed. But they invest your vast ballances and unsettled funds.
933 2018-01-25 17:14:02 Thank you I’ve bought in loads of stocks on rumours and lost money on them and i have never felt the need to put the blame on anyone - everyone talks their own book anyway i prefer to ignore the noise it’s been a good day on Vast and THR can’t win them all
934 2018-01-25 17:13:48 Just opened the Roth IRA, only thing i have in there are cannabis stocks lol. I cant withdraw for 30 years. #Gasmoney 
935 2018-01-25 17:13:34 You get more out of a trade when you find trendline pullbacks! Especially when stocks really rally. 
#alwaysGreen
936 2018-01-25 17:13:24 @TeamFastMoney That Carter said NFLX will fall from $251 and AAPL will go up more than other tech stocks! LOL opposite directions NFLX is $271 +  what a chart goner!
937 2018-01-25 17:13:02 Sorry, that was the last administration that fed money into Wall Street from the Reserve. That is why stocks were good when Trump became @POTUS.
938 2018-01-25 17:12:20 Anyone know about investing in stocks? Looking to get into it.
939 2018-01-25 17:12:10 Le pétrole au plus haut depuis trois ans, entre dollar faible et baisse des stocks
940 2018-01-25 17:11:37 I covered $NFLX in my Mid Week Video. Stocks that report good earnings tend to get follow through… a bit above the channel high now though!
941 2018-01-25 17:10:08 Markets are frothy right now, lots of ppl getting excited about stocks, rentals, crypto, etc. Let me just say this... if you’re living above your means and have debt that is not aggressively being paid off, then you have zero business investing or speculating.
942 2018-01-25 17:09:58 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
943 2018-01-25 17:09:34 In The Market: Still a far minority among leading #stocks, but $OLED $COHR trigger the "golden rule" by falling 7%-8% below their most recent buy points. Signals need to be a bit wary of #techs that vaulted in 2017. $AVGO gives back a 10% gain since clearing 259.46 entry #charts

945 2018-01-25 17:08:05 Obama was using quantitative easing by printing money left and right. Pushing interests rates which bounced investors from stocks and bonds.
946 2018-01-25 17:07:40 Feels so good having a job that offered me to start my stocks with them

948 2018-01-25 17:07:13 This will also spark inflation which is reflected solely on the current value of US stocks. Treasury yields will undoubtedly go higher. Foreign treasury yields may not be able to compete and they may have dollar supply issues.
949 2018-01-25 17:06:15 In fact what I’d suggest, is following @Awkturtle1 he ramps his own stocks to death (who doesn’t) but he calls people out for being a cunt regularly and I haven’t seen one wrong call yet. Note the names. They don’t want to help you, they just want your money
950 2018-01-25 17:06:03 US Stocks are trying to fix themselves...

951 2018-01-25 17:05:19 They need to expand to the UK ASAP. I wanna put crypto earnings into stocks but the fees would eat me alive

957 2018-01-25 17:01:33 I just spent this whole morning trying to use Robinhoods app for crypto and stocks, but sadly I'm a Canadian.

959 2018-01-25 17:01:07 That’s the same reason day traders buy stocks.  They have no concern for underlying value either.  Need to make a distinction between people trading bitcoin and those who think they are “investing”
960 2018-01-25 17:00:34 The hard thing is regulating it without legitimizing it. Bonds and stocks are legal contracts and if you apply the existing suite of regulations to crypto are you also saying crypto has legal standing?
961 2018-01-25 17:00:16 You should see the dividends on my coffin maker and funeral home stocks. Talk about seeing health bonuses.

These are both heading to at least $1.50/$2.00 - like all the previous SPY OOMs did, from 10c to 15x

975 2018-01-25 16:55:50 It may be as burdensome and injurious to the State of New York, if we look to the ban of the people; secondly, a knowledge of stocks, bonds, and that the strawberry began to vary again in the ordinary course of law.
976 2018-01-25 16:55:32 Incredible how undervalued stocks were for so many years...
977 2018-01-25 16:55:27 Today’s purchase: 10 shares of $F for $116.59 ($11.16/share).

Of the 140-plus stocks in my portfolio, it was one of my top three worst performers of the morning. That’s when I like to buy ... when a stock is down. I doubled my position and averaged down in the process.

985 2018-01-25 16:51:50 Obama invested money in the poor & middle class who bought the products that stimulated further growth in our economy. Trump borrowed $1.5 trillion to invest in the rich who are turning right around and using it to chase stocks in an already frothy market. A crash is inevitable!

988 2018-01-25 16:51:16 @Varneyco Feldstein is an irresponsible fear monger, stocks are going down, do not know when or by how much but they are going down, my 3 year old gd could say the same thing, what are we supposed to do with the info
989 2018-01-25 16:51:00 @inursha stocks always fill gaps. Will come down to 225 this year at some point.
990 2018-01-25 16:50:20 I’ll say I have to agree on that. Trump tweets about the unemployment % being the lowest it’s been in years and the stocks being up and I’m really glad to hear it.
991 2018-01-25 16:50:15 If you don't want a wall of men explaining how the world works, go manage a portfolio for a decade and then be invited on to a weekly podcast to discuss Walmart's earning season? You SJWing someone who tries to educate individual investors with limited acumen on stocks.

1016 2018-01-25 16:42:25 Only a matter of time before Acorns and Stash follow. My guess is the line between traditional stocks and crypto tokens will begin to blur. The current state of clearing firms will become legacy and stocks will leverage blockchains somehow. Developers will demand it.
1017 2018-01-25 16:41:41 With the exception of $leaf from Canada talked about on #fastmoney #marijuana stocks not doing much today except $potn in literally on fire.

1022 2018-01-25 16:39:19 Yes warehousing of stocks is very common problem for all traders.. when we get stuck at higher levels and the stocks goes way below entry price we are the first ones to Thank God and exit at cost. This is exactly when the stock heads higher 
1023 2018-01-25 16:38:32 There is 0 patience. Guys, stocks don't just go straight up... This was trading at .001 just a couple of weeks ago.. Of course it needs to correct, churn, take profits.. 

Nothing has changed, they still are doing the same business, why are people thinking bad things just because
1024 2018-01-25 16:37:14 If there's been a virtual wipe-out, or it's a new water, probaby doesn't really matter that much, but even there it seems somewhat obvious that stocks should be sourced locally wherever possible, and lotic stocks used for lotic environments etc.

1035 2018-01-25 16:33:55 Absolutely; if we don't have discussions, we're living in an echo chamber of our own making. No new ideas. 

Getting rid of the loophole, bump stocks, & easy modifications to auto are all good ideas. All weapons registered at each sale, also. Too many criminals taking advantage.
1036 2018-01-25 16:33:07 Although more of a council matter, there did appear to be a lack of gritting in Glasgow. I am not surprised there are stocks left, it sure wasn't spread where it was needed.
1037 2018-01-25 16:31:48 Doesn't that describe the stock market, though? I mean, except for dividend stocks.

1039 2018-01-25 16:30:37 Tbh, I haven't lose any money. I earned 20folds already ;) It's still an investment. Investment is just another word for gambling. You invest on stocks, stocks depreciates value, you lose money. or the other way around. Same with cryptocurrency. Just be smart

1059 2018-01-25 16:21:58 In the conservative brain, two events are proven to be causally related if they are merely contemporaneous. (Remember when stocks went up "because" Trump got inaugurated that week?) Every conspiracy theory is based on thin gruel like "within months of X happening, Y happened".

1111 2018-01-25 16:05:17 Robinhood sucks for stocks so I can't imagine it will be a good platform for crypto . It appeals to people who are penny wise pound foolish when it comes to commission pricing, but the platform sucks for stocks at least.
1112 2018-01-25 16:05:02 Dude Trump got in last year, his only signature economic legislation past congress a month ago. Don't let your bias cloud your judgment or eyes. Trump inherited the good Obama economy and primed the pump with a tax windfall for those investors. Stocks does not make economy.

1123 2018-01-25 15:58:03 Very insightful analysis @michaelbatnick. To add to it,  worth noting that the starting point, 2008, was the beginning of the GFC which caused major loss and damage to bank index. One would also argue that tech stocks may be a bit stretched now (ending point).

1188 2018-01-25 15:31:07 The move in the greenback has been breathtaking and I wonder if the move in multinationals is extrapolating a further decline. Or maybe the world thinks we're on the cusp of inflation (a plausible theory.) Then stocks are the hedge.

1191 2018-01-25 15:30:25 And stocks are great, 401K is great. I have it with a company match. But most poor and many middle class aren't in the stock market, don't have jobs that offer it or disposable income to invest. So while this helps some, we must keep in mind that it leaves others further behind.
1192 2018-01-25 15:30:06 On a very (very) short-term basis, it's a wee bit concerning to see most commodity stocks just sit there when the US$ is sinking -- what happens if it bounces?

1204 2018-01-25 15:24:19 Looks like stocks are just trying to build a base, ahead of another short squeeze Friday.

1222 2018-01-25 15:15:42 NO IT WASN’T!! Obama was printing money and funneling that into government invested stocks to keep the stock market stable. Government employment spiked which helped the stock stay stable. Did you ever hear any of these corporations handing out massive bonuses under Obama?
1223 2018-01-25 15:15:37 I wonder how much is due to influence of index funds buying an increasing percentage of largest market cap stocks - a virtuous cycle.

1239 2018-01-25 15:10:16 The problem with the bump stock ban was Democrats. Dems added language that would have broadly banned a lot more than bump stocks. They killed consensus with over reach.

1290 2018-01-25 14:57:50 The fact is, penny stocks gain the attention of the worst traders out there, so they spook easily, start mass selling, it hits stop losses, and then the day traders/shorters swoop in like carrion. The domino effect gets nasty.

1292 2018-01-25 14:56:03 Look at $LRCX as well.   Stocks are tired for now
1293 2018-01-25 14:55:00 Wealthy banks get wealthier.  What about Verizon pouring their gains into their bottom line instead of into the workforce?  Claim it will raise stocks for employees.  Which employees own the most stock I wonder?

1297 2018-01-25 14:52:42 The laugh is mining shows classic speculation syndrome. You even have the dot com effect of increasing your stocks value by saying you are opening a cryprocurrency.

1306 2018-01-25 14:51:11 Reminder: the GOP hasn't made a single effort to restrict the sale of bump-stocks, which facilitated the Las Vegas massacre.

Instead, the House GOP passed a bill to require gun license reciprocity across state lines.

There have been 11 school shootings in 2018.

1317 2018-01-25 14:46:53 Do millennials as a group even buy individual stocks? Have they learned nothing from their parents’ mistakes? I would have thought they would be the ETF generation.
1318 2018-01-25 14:46:50 Stocks open higher, Dow +108 points.
1319 2018-01-25 14:46:42 The quick solution though is people say go after their dividends with high taxes. But with 60+% of Americans owning stocks, that hurts us too. And that’s invested on excess income that already had taxes paid on it.

1335 2018-01-25 14:41:40 WOW Students make bad decisions taking easy classes. So they cannot get jobs   So they want American taxpayers to pay for their stupid mistakes. So will American taxpayers pay for my bad choices of stocks

1338 2018-01-25 14:40:24 See my answer above. Bump stocks by themselves are not unsafe. People who break the law and commit evil acts are.
1339 2018-01-25 14:39:53 Alcohol and marijuana weren't eliminated, but they also aren't financial instruments. A better example would be a stock that succeeded despite being banned from the NYSE and major exchanges. Buying such stocks is possible, but their value is extremely low.

1344 2018-01-25 14:37:13 U r basically describing what we already have. The only 2 ideas that haven’t been implemented already r closing the private sale loophole & banning bump stocks. Tightening gun control that little bit more might help but it won’t b the end-all solution, these arguments r pointless
1345 2018-01-25 14:37:05 Piece of shit comedians with shit patreons that pay out maybe 50k are talking stocks and about their friend buying stocks.

This has to be the top.
1346 2018-01-25 14:36:13 I am sorry.  When a Trump supporter always comes back with "check your 401K or your stocks" I believe it gives me free license to shame them with their shameless lack of empathy for their fellow man.  If that makes me a bad person, so be it.  My soul is intact. I am good with me.
1347 2018-01-25 14:36:13 Maybe they should bring back "the stocks" for guys like this...?
1348 2018-01-25 14:35:42 Lithium stocks in general have seen a pullback over this last week, not $AA though. Damn, that thing has been on a tear! Congrats to all the longs and all those who hopped in for a ride
1349 2018-01-25 14:35:22 My stocks continue to mock my stops.
1350 2018-01-25 14:34:19 Great thread. This begs the question, “how do you know if an asset w/no cash flows is under or over valued?”. For stocks you have multiples, for gold/crypto you have?
1351 2018-01-25 14:33:54 Going back a little further than 10 years catches the 2002-07 bear market and pessimism did not work well at all as a contrary indicator. Bear mkts in commodities/currencies tend to act differently than those in stocks/bonds.
1352 2018-01-25 14:33:53 Fair point. In the aggregate, though, stocks and real estate move upward over time while fiat, at best, is stable. And stable is a great characteristic for fiat.
1353 2018-01-25 14:33:32 Woolies now stocks Bobbi Brown...I didn't know.

1355 2018-01-25 14:32:48 Thinking about buying stocks
1356 2018-01-25 14:32:15 I’m not. Which is why I said it should be the first step. The first step of many to stop the carnage. Human error allowed the Texas shooter to get guns. A ban on bump stocks would have slowed the LV shooter down. And so on

1359 2018-01-25 14:30:12 we need a pullback in stocks to get a little of the froth off but the fact is the earnings/growth/buybacks/money from bonds into stocks...there is reasons to run.i think this is like 98/99 but if we are 95/96 we got a long run coming
1360 2018-01-25 14:29:43 Currency is just the shared denominator.  We could price all stocks in bottles of Coca-Cola if we wanted to.  But that doesn’t mean a bottle of Coca-Cola has a “valuation."

1385 2018-01-25 14:17:35 Inflation is probably the worst thing you want at this point in the cycle because high enough yields will eventually whack stocks.
1386 2018-01-25 14:17:24 How many companies are not paying bonuses or higher wages? How many are paying dividends and buying back stocks?

1403 2018-01-25 14:08:43 The rapid rise was from over-hyped promises that took longer than expected to fulfill. You can argue it got overvalued but its no p&d.

1410 2018-01-25 14:05:14 exactly. I love how these "higher-ups" bash crypto whenever they get the chance, but embrace the "traditional" stock markets.  If you don't do your research with stocks you can lose money just as easily as you can in crypto. #FUD

1448 2018-01-25 13:52:07 European stocks are up +0.30% ahead of the conclusion of today's ECB meeting and press conference from ECB President Draghi.
1449 2018-01-25 13:52:06 This was a good one. On a similar note, many phenomena have a correlation between the sample correlations and their variances. This often throws off a bunch of models. Good example is stocks/markets. When volatility shoots up, correlation between stocks also shoots up

1464 2018-01-25 13:46:01 Pretty sure if you bought a market cap weighted whole stock market portfolio just before the '28 stock crash and held it 10 years, you would have been fine. Stocks are volatile but that's why you shift retirement portfolios toward bonds as you get closer to retiring.

1480 2018-01-25 13:38:39 If you want protection when investing purchase municipal bonds. The risk is why stocks return as well as they do. Maybe the government should regulate art work or classic cars. What if the price goes down? People may lose money. People choose where and how to invest or to at all.
1481 2018-01-25 13:38:27 Bump stocks. Bump stocks. Bump stocks.
1482 2018-01-25 13:38:16 I agree. Stocks now Gold, Oil, USD, all reflect that. Big picture fundamentals finally taking charge. Wave 3 rally underway here negates all typical analysis "for the time being" but Wave 3s end.  So I'll keep reporting on these until they do matter again.

1562 2018-01-25 12:54:43 This must be one of the best valued stocks on the market today considering its record of EPS growth, yield and PE. I hold and am hoping for a big re-rate, but needs to break free of it's long term trading range first!
1563 2018-01-25 12:54:31 What time frame do you work with?  With a much less volatile market (stocks) I think most use 6 months.

1593 2018-01-25 12:36:51 And then they crashed. Because stocks are not equal to “economy”... they are the frosting and fall apart if the cake was faked.

1678 2018-01-25 11:18:07 The mechanics of stocks are different. Bitcoin is like gold, you buy it in the hopes to sell it with profit. Stocks are more like farms, the companies produce profits which are distributed to stockowners. Like a farm that grow crops.

1918 2018-01-25 07:16:33 I really don’t know. But my retirement money is on the line. It ain’t much. If it doesn’t grow, I’m screwed in my 60s. Part of me wants the little ice got in a mattress. Something just feels unsustainable right now. Huge tax cuts. Increased inequality. Job losses. Rising stocks.

I just spoke to the chap who called me asking how does he know if I am interested in stocks?

He said he knows that I am not really because that is the database he has with him. He offered to tell me the source if I don't report the number.
1938 2018-01-25 07:05:38 Not quite. $BA just went parabolic this month, and a year ago when I was asked about getting into "stocks" I felt it was in the meat of leg 3. I'm starting to feel it's long in the tooth...so probably another year higher but I'm comfortable getting flat now.

1966 2018-01-25 06:36:40 Most of the equity mutual funds have a lot of chunk in Banks and IT,  and these stocks have been doing good. When the sensex nosedives the funds go down too but the reverse does not seem to be true.
1967 2018-01-25 06:35:59 Exactly. Negative gearing is merely taxpayer subsidized speculation. Capital gain has always been the end game. And Howard, in his wisdom halved tax on capital gain. 
Let's not forget negative gearing also applies to stocks (reason leveraged equities margin loans popular)
1968 2018-01-25 06:35:55 This is not against science, It is pure GREED, they want to own their own stocks so they can maintain their stock prices high.
1969 2018-01-25 06:34:29 I think the issue of ability to scale another 36000% has to do with market cap size now? I’d say you are not living in reality to think it can do that again this year.  Only micro stocks can.  You cannot multiply 50 billion cap by any figure under 10x to get realistic number rt?

1984 2018-01-25 06:24:31 Better invest in Amazon stocks as soon as possible.
1985 2018-01-25 06:23:53 While I agree with most of the thread, I think 'widely regarded' here is overstated. Any investment professional would risk rate stocks as high, not safe. And a typical novice 'saver' wouldn't generally go for stocks
1986 2018-01-25 06:21:08 Trump and the GOP are too busy counting their money and stocks they just made for themselves.  

They like to pretend they are pro-life but that is nothing further from the truth.  They are pro-fetus. Because fetuses cant talk back. Or vote.

2003 2018-01-25 06:04:38 My basic recollection is that it's very hard to beat an S&P500 index fund for stocks, which are a bit riskier and deliver better in good markets.

When the markets are bad and going down, bonds are better than stocks, though I forget the common bond indexes.

Balancing the two...

 I'll be reading the labels carefully to make sure I'm not purchasing anything that has to do with this company. Let's hit them where it hurts, their wallet and their Stocks!
2030 2018-01-25 05:39:47 Will rates hit stocks? That might be one of the only speed bumps in sight. Valuation is high but if nobody cares for now that's not a downside catalyst.

2033 2018-01-25 05:38:33 usually cause graphics are not you're own material and have been copyrighted and used by other stocks and stuff so u would have to buy the pictures if u were to use itcommercially!!
2034 2018-01-25 05:37:31 If you need to share ideas on TV, Twitter or Shareholding Pattern to make money in your stocks, you ain't an expert.
2035 2018-01-25 05:36:28 No anyone with MONEY can own stocks, when half of America is 1 to 2 paychecks away from disaster they can't buy stock.... What kind of privileged world do you live in to not know that
2036 2018-01-25 05:35:04 I swear, the Steam marketplace is like real life stocks. Watching those graphs go up and down, but the biggest issue I have with it is that it's so unstable. All it takes is a few people, even just 1, to drop the overall value faster than a sluts pants.
2037 2018-01-25 05:33:38 I'm pretty content with my ledge game, both in terms of getting back from offstage in funky ways that punish overextending, as well as pressuring/baiting ledge options that I can read and punish to seal stocks.

Probably only thing I might practice a bit is covering jump options.
2038 2018-01-25 05:32:52 401k and IRA own stocks. Anyone with a brain can own stocks. Ordinary people own about $10T in stocks. But retirement will be harder if you are in the stupid 20%
2039 2018-01-25 05:31:12 50% correction happened already. Let's see how they are soing when stocks and bonds lose 50%....
2040 2018-01-25 05:29:51 Whether your rationale behind buying the stock is more important than the market cap. Stock specific approach is more important than classifying stocks according to their market cap or sector. E.g. biocon has been a multibagger when pharma was bleeding.
2041 2018-01-25 05:28:30 Nah, he's pretty awesome. Sure he's not perfect. Sure he can be an asshole. But he's getting shit done. Economy, jobs, 401K, 529 and stocks are all up... Wish the debt was lower and less involved over seas, but that's a result of the last 2 fuck ups.
2042 2018-01-25 05:28:29 1/2 of Americans don't own stocks?  yet more than 50% are investing in IRA's or 401k's..  see the flaw in your statement?
2043 2018-01-25 05:27:09 Unless his stock dropped cause of his Senior Bowl. We will see. Watching a lot of stocks drop and a lot soar. It's very interesting.
2044 2018-01-25 05:26:43 thats not the point, every dollar you put into the market you will lose. you are literally giving your money away. if you are just getting into trading and your looking at buying these kinds of charts, youve already lost. you can only make money shorting these stocks. period
2045 2018-01-25 05:26:20 I wanna get into stocks 
2046 2018-01-25 05:24:04 @FXS_Stocks_EN thanks for the follow 
2047 2018-01-25 05:24:00 if this tweet was for professionals like kapil sir , then you are perfect , but for lay investor whose trading allocation in stocks , nifty varies it can be non profitable even loss making , because retailers are very poor in allocation of trades
2048 2018-01-25 05:21:06 Unemployment was always falling because it fell under Obama. Stocks increased too, under the Obama administration. With this type of public cant, isnt it obvious what trump is doing? He is using the status of a black person to cover his ass. get serious man, MLK fucking niece?lol
2049 2018-01-25 05:20:56 Beat Peabnut 3-2 and made a loser's run in THREE STOCKS.
2050 2018-01-25 05:20:42 Sir your view on sugar stocks?
2051 2018-01-25 05:20:34 As a gluten-free vegan, I used to shop exclusively at WFM. Now you couldn't pay me enough to walk thru the door. Constant out-of-stocks, discontinued items, poor customer service. Especially since have now been absorbed by evil empire Amazon.
2052 2018-01-25 05:19:34 Trump is NOT the reason stocks are doing so well

2059 2018-01-25 05:16:09 ofcourse!...that is part of the plan....you dont go into a war zone on your neighbours tip!
2060 2018-01-25 05:15:11 This suggestion is also an emotional one. A stock should be sold when the stock has lost its MOAT and competitive advantage and there is no future for growth. Stocks should not be sold based on non love. Would Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham give this advice?
2061 2018-01-25 05:14:42 あー相変わらず体調悪い。こんな日はロングだな。
2062 2018-01-25 05:13:18 It was 8 trillion into the economy!! and stands to be more at the rate things are going but liberals don't talk about that they keep up their hating ways quietly benefiting in their 401k's and stocks if they had the choice to go back a couple years they would not period!!

2077 2018-01-25 05:01:48 Ah but those employees will also get the dividends and the value of the rising price of their new stocks as well. Not nothing.

2082 2018-01-25 04:58:53 Weiss needs to keep their noses out of this market. I have been buying stocks that have a bearish or very bearish rating and making good returns on them. AMD 18-20% return in a month.
2083 2018-01-25 04:57:40 Thanks. If passing a bill that would increase taxes for 50%+ of people, having a govt shutdown, and ruining the future of 700k+ young people is winning for you, then great.
I will admit that the eco is doing well and so are stocks.
2084 2018-01-25 04:54:56 The fact that I am glad that I am learning about stocks is surprising me.

2095 2018-01-25 04:41:31 What’s never explained in trading is he importance of a trend filter. When it comes to riding 6-12 month trends. Using momentum requires understanding how to rank trade ideas when momentum is carrying the stock market, how do you select good stocks vs great stocks?

2101 2018-01-25 04:36:11 If something is illegal it makes it harder to own. If the guy in Vegas had to throw knives from the 22nd window, he wouldn't have killed as many people. Why do people need bump stocks armor piercing bullets to defend their homes or hunt.
2102 2018-01-25 04:35:51 People in the story you quoted are so ill informed that they don’t know if they contribute to 401k much less that it may be invested in stocks. Holly heck Batman, being that disinterested or worse ain’t the wealthy’s fault. Self reliance people

2105 2018-01-25 04:34:50 ICICI Pru PMS - “Smallcap stocks are cyclical in nature. E.g. it rallied between 2003 and 2007 and then they saw a significant correction. It took almost 10 yrs for investors to recoup the losses,” he said. “We want our investors to be shielded as much as possible."

2109 2018-01-25 04:33:30 In fairness, he has not hurt me personally. I got a large tax cut I didn’t ask for and stocks are up (not due to any specific Trump policy). Unfortunately, Trump doesn’t truly care about the folks who actually need his help, and they are not likely to get much under his watch.

2123 2018-01-25 04:24:01 I don't know what could've been done to prevent it, but I would be supporting legislation to ban bump stocks, at the very least. My question is, how does one claim "right to life" and be utterly complicit when it comes to gun rights?

2149 2018-01-25 04:07:49 To obtain stricter gun laws against assault weapons and bump stocks we need to deal with NRA and congress. Neither of them were moved enough after the murder of kindergarten children at Sandy Hook to act. Shameful. Most Congress is owned by NRA . We need to vote them out.

2158 2018-01-25 04:01:34 Pm
2159 2018-01-25 04:01:22 But but but, thoughts and prayers fix everything...right?  Still haven’t even had the decency to ban bump stocks. Effing ridiculous.
2160 2018-01-25 04:00:42 If a Twitter user is bashing stocks 100% of the time & praising iHub's most well known paid basher in most of those Tweets - chances are he's either the same person or being paid by said person. It's too obvious.

If you didn't know, iHub is a terrible and dishonest place.
2161 2018-01-25 03:59:17 A start might be for us to insist that our congressmen  ban bump stocks and assault weapons that were made for the military originally. At least they would be left with guns that can't rapid fire and not able to mow down defenseless children at Sandy Hook and concert goers.

2174 2018-01-25 03:50:16 @kroyrunner89 hi Tim, quite frustrated by my trading so want seek your advice. in the morning, I monitored premarket mover, top nasdaq mover, gap up. most time I lost when I placed my trades as the stocks started going down. I'm not sure how you scan the potential trade.  thanks
2175 2018-01-25 03:49:46 Most of the lazy portfolios work reasonably well. Stocks, bonds, and gold have a long term correlation matrix that is all zeros. An example portfolio is the Harry Browne Permanent Portfolio. It is even somewhat dollar neutral.
2176 2018-01-25 03:49:08 Walmart owns Sams that's their choice!! 
Kmart poor management closed stores for years
And so on !! Nothing to do with our President!! Has to do with online shopping!! Stocks are soaring!! 
Taxes are lowered!! Many companies are giving bonuses!! More money in our paychecks!!

2186 2018-01-25 03:41:47 We need to start somewhere and do it gradually. We can't even get our government to ban bump stocks or ak47's. I don't want to take all guns, just the kind used in Las Vegas or Sandy Hook where  kindergarten children were mowed down. (Assault rifles) Give no guns to mentally ill.

2209 2018-01-25 03:25:44 There's hope that they're changing their minds, though. Fox mostly talks about it from a mental health perspective now (which I think is the real issue), and the NRA didn't come out in favour of bumpfire stocks after Vegas. Conservatives are slowly changing on this issue.

2243 2018-01-25 03:06:25 Lol, overall performance of the market is driven by a few, high-priced stocks and, most of the time, companies buy their own shares to artificially grow their own share price... so, no real growth there, mate. Guess you really like to drink that conservative kool-aid, bro

2288 2018-01-25 02:43:39 You should of course consult your own CPAs, but I've consulted several crypto-savvy CPAs in the US and not a single one has recommended applying section 1031. Like-Kind was meant for physical property, it doesn't even apply to stocks/securities.

Indexes are slightly upward while most stocks in correction mode except Psu bank, IT....
Power n consumer goods stocks has nice volume AVG which can easily push it 8-10% upwards.
Indexes should have been corrected further....
2309 2018-01-25 02:28:18 #Dwyer is right. If will get ugly for stocks & it will get ugly for Bonds too. A stock & bond bear mkt is upon us & it will be concurrent!!!
2310 2018-01-25 02:27:12 I’m not sure.  I have to buy the US versions of these stocks on the OTC market.
2311 2018-01-25 02:26:10 Joshua,  I would most definitely say that closing Sam's Club stores and laying off thousands of workers would not be an indicator of financial success. For stakeholders in the company, they would be more inclined to sell their stocks if these closing and layoffs continue.#ECU4842
2312 2018-01-25 02:25:50 @BMTheEquityDesk bought thoughtful investor. great reading. one query. i have some good banking stocks. now at lifetime highs. shall i sell to cover my cost of investment to foreclose home loans@9% or continue to hold. icici sbi pnb yes
2313 2018-01-25 02:25:44 IMO there has never been a better time to buy MJ stocks. It's easy to find faults during the introduction stage of any industry, but it still has to grow and mature. Wouldn't it be best to buy before it grows, and ride the wave up.... imo it would be. Opportunity doesn't wait.

2316 2018-01-25 02:23:37 Yes, just 30% of the American population owns 300 million guns.  It's astounding. Yet we can not pass laws on mandatory universal background checks to literally save our lives.  Why do you think that is?  ONE man shot 500 people and Congress has done nothing about bump stocks.
2317 2018-01-25 02:22:59 Dude look like he sells penny stocks in a back ally warehouse
2318 2018-01-25 02:21:44 That is and should be the phase after the stocks have been reacting positive to negative numbers or no positives.
2319 2018-01-25 02:20:57 You say you grieve. You offer prayers & broken hearts, but do nothing in response.
Where's the ban on bump stocks, where's ANY effort to curb the violence?
2320 2018-01-25 02:20:08 Stocks Trump wages.. those employees can earn residual income off that stock long after they retire! A wage increase is crumbs compared to stock any day.
2321 2018-01-25 02:19:31 Hi Joe! Thank you for sharing! Would you mind to post some OpEx for stocks too?

2323 2018-01-25 02:18:56 Las Vegas seem like the ideal place to show off your heavy machinery. Especially your bump-stocks from a high position during a country music festival.
2324 2018-01-25 02:18:19 I agree they could give more but they aren't required to give anything. As an employee I love saving in taxes and being given 2k+ in free stocks.  If I remember right, the left argued companies wouldn't share with employees.  Now it is well sure they share but it should be more.

2328 2018-01-25 02:15:58 Lol sometimes weve bought and sold by 08:03. Only a few minutes to anyone not associated with buying RNS news story stocks, but to most traders buying/selling news its a cardinal sin being down at 08:00 for even 20 seconds nevermind minutes. I hope its working at 8AM Thursday.
2329 2018-01-25 02:15:45 You are going to enforce gun control laws and ban assault rifles and bump stocks? Cool.
2330 2018-01-25 02:14:45 This year I wanna invest in some stocks along with building my credit
2331 2018-01-25 02:14:26 someone teach me how to start investing in stocks

2335 2018-01-25 02:12:27 I own guns for self protection. I'm not against hunting if the animals culled are the oldest and weakest and the entire animal is eaten and used. I'm against automatic military type guns for civilians and bump stocks. No one in the country needs an arsenal!

2338 2018-01-25 02:11:55 Apa konsepnya ya.. merotasi stocks ketika full on margin.

Ketika portfolio isinya jagoan semua, actively rotating bisa merugikan, karena gak kasih cukup waktu.

Hm.. nulis sendiri, merenung sendiri.. 

Well, mungkin itu jawabnya, cukup waktu to perform..

2341 2018-01-25 02:09:17 What is the biggest challenge in the #markets now? Finding undervalued growth gems and not chasing B and C grade stocks. Not easy - now that everyone has got their greed factor activated. #stocks #trading

2344 2018-01-25 02:06:56 no you're not with "them" or us until you tighten guns laws & get military type firearms off the streets along with bump stocks, and stop letting the NRA dictate these laws, AND STOP TAKING THEIR MONEY. MOST OF ALL STOP LYING!
2345 2018-01-25 02:04:51 Not saying u can't make money off #Cryptos or WEED $STocks just saying it's like being down 1 point on a 1 vs none fastbreak10secs left, but you pull up and shoot a 3...for what???....Why would you do that...Think people...
2346 2018-01-25 02:04:46 Stocks plunge? 13 month of record breaking highs. Might want to get on the riding high Trump train and enjoy the prosperity instead of try to derail it.
2347 2018-01-25 02:04:32 The chart looks good as far as holding that trendline it has been on the last few months but every time it gets volume they just dump paper. Still hasnt had a run like the other pot stocks so maybe they run it. Lets hope it does and we all bank
2348 2018-01-25 02:01:46 Stock market has been on a tear! Will it hit 30,000 soon?

2351 2018-01-25 01:59:32 Dump said he wanted to give the tax cuts to the big companies because they would create jobs???NO  They bought back stocks for their shareholders and have closed stores and laid off thousands! The rich get richer - the poor get poorer!!
2352 2018-01-25 01:59:24 You are probably one of the few senators that is not invested in drug company stocks.
2353 2018-01-25 01:59:07 Bad news for gun lobby as it weighs filing suit to block MA's ban on bump stocks: "Laws banning especially dangerous guns—such as assault weapons—and large capacity ammunition magazines are not takings and do not require compensation" (Giffords Law Center) #GunLawsWork #mapoli
2354 2018-01-25 01:58:22 I like $abhi the product is sound and they own the patent. Only problem is suspended by SEC for late filings. It’s a penny stock so you can’t expect much but it’s a proven product. Also $bayp for Pot stocks. Just my opinions. $bvtk has potential IF they ever show sales and rev.
2355 2018-01-25 01:57:58 Gun manufacturers could do a lot to make gun's safer.  Why don't they?  Customized one-shooter stocks, child proofing, remote disabling fields, end gun trade between individuals (aka, take a cut). Stop crying that it's sacred.  Lead, or be beaten into dust.
2356 2018-01-25 01:57:17 Which if ur stocks are making u wait for up move?
2357 2018-01-25 01:56:19 If you've ever wanted to invest in anything...WEED #stocks are for suckers, clowns and PRO's which ur not!

2363 2018-01-25 01:53:52 Fiction - but invest in less risky options when you need the money sooner, like GICs vs stocks
2364 2018-01-25 01:53:50 Canadian MJ stocks have already seen a huge boom.  The next boom will be in July.   Wait for pullbacks or invest in smaller caps with room for growth like $IVITF, $CBWTF, $EMBFF, and one of my favorites $OGRMF
2365 2018-01-25 01:52:51 You need to diversify your portfolio bruh. Take out some money from weed stocks and put it into surf boards.

2378 2018-01-25 01:46:31 Can’t forget GE. #45 campaigned in Erie, PA, home of GE Transportation. He promised to save manufacturing jobs & bring more back. Turned long time Blue town Red.  

Layoffs started well before GE stocks began to sink.Since 2010, 1500 jobs lost; 575 in 2017 alone & more to come.
2379 2018-01-25 01:46:07 @CNN CLINTON LOST BECAUSE ONLY BERNIE SANDERS FORCED HER TO INCLUDE FREE TUITION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND HAD LITTLE FOR THE JOBLESS PEOPLE..NOW DONALD TRUMP WILL GIVE AWAY MORE WEALTH TO THE FILTHY RICH  SELL YOUR STOCKS. IMPEACHMENT WILL CRASH STOCK MARKET.
2380 2018-01-25 01:45:13 I'll concede that the corporate tax cuts will create a stimulus. But it's short term and creates a big problem in future. Government deficit will increase and its hard to add taxes once you cut them without affecting stocks etc. So we'll be stuck with a broke government.
2381 2018-01-25 01:45:13 Restricted stock is not a bonus. It’s a certificate for stocks. They also have a vesting period. There is no immediate economic advantage of RSUs, so everyone who could benefit from a cash bonus now, or if you leave the company, you lose a portion.

2387 2018-01-25 01:43:00 Minehart said he has a permit to carry a gun. He said that he doesn't think there should be automatic weapons, 30-clip magazines or bump stocks.

2389 2018-01-25 01:42:02 I started trading penny stocks when I was 21/22 by watching experienced traders on twitter do it & taught myself the basics of how the market works from the bottom up. Researching everything I didn’t know or understand on google & youtube helped a lot.

Today I see many parallels to the year before the Great Recession with the exception of low unemployment: rapid rise in stock market, overbought stocks, etc.
2397 2018-01-25 01:39:13 I'm proud of our @POTUS too. The stocks are at an all-time high, unemployment down, jobs created & dems r still hoping 4 Russian collusion!

2405 2018-01-25 01:34:23 Quit the crypto, trade canadian weed stocks. Many Up 300%+ in 60 days. My fav is up 352%  after being up 18% for 3 straight days.
2406 2018-01-25 01:34:11 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
2407 2018-01-25 01:33:31 It seems like the much of the marketing of Investment houses is tailored towards mutual funds and trending stocks. Please do your research and NEVER forget the power of qualified bonds. Investing is a journey and YOU hold the cards to YOUR money! Not Mr Market!
2408 2018-01-25 01:33:03 I wonder which gov'ts and institutions will be left holding these underperforming stocks in a few years...

have ANY Canadian institutional investors announced #fossilfuel divestment? Maybe a couple of unis?
2409 2018-01-25 01:33:02 No you’re not! Ban bump stocks and ghost guns! Require background checks on ALL gun sales!

2412 2018-01-25 01:31:50 Most major profits have been taken by now you'd think...(you could be right though) Gas one of the best traders in Australia so worries me when he says one line "$AB1 will close 8.8c"  we have seen stocks move higher on lower revenue, these guy have made $467,000 in 2 weeks.
2413 2018-01-25 01:31:29 All stocks are sold out
2414 2018-01-25 01:31:20 1. This bull mkt didn't belong to tech. 
2. No growth in profit/sales last 4 qtrs
3. When stocks like infy/tcs moving up nobody will buy a smallcap
4. Current phase of bull mkt coming to an end. People just moving around money preparing for correction.
2415 2018-01-25 01:30:09 Doesn't this argument assume that someone should be roughly indifferent between ~1 percent stocks and ~7 percent bonds even after the mortgage is paid off? The fact that that's the market's indifference curve doesn't imply it should be mine.
2416 2018-01-25 01:29:50 I beg to differ with you. Please don't use the deceptive practice of making people think that all will get raises, bonuses, stocks or 401 K enhancements in the so called 220 companies. They won't and the Vito's will reap the rewards not the worker bees.
2417 2018-01-25 01:29:50 The best growth stocks are the best value stocks in disguise.
2418 2018-01-25 01:28:22 #InvestSmart There's one thing I've learned from my husband about the stock market; there's penny stocks. So you don't have to spend a lot
2419 2018-01-25 01:27:40 Why are you THAT confident about $TGOD, Jason, what with it IPOing after a lot of pot stocks have already skyrocketed?

2424 2018-01-25 01:18:54 It’s already open and accessible. Always was and always is. Funny some of the companies that favor net neutrality and fighting for it said without it things wouldn’t be good meanwhile their stocks are making new highs - the EO was only two years ago. Internet much older than that
2425 2018-01-25 01:18:37 Closed na po :( I will do open another one once the mags arrived (hopefully may stocks pa)
2426 2018-01-25 01:18:13 Asian stocks traded mixed early on Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 underperforming other major regional indexes.

2430 2018-01-25 01:16:29 @amazon paying for Prime has become a joke with your company.  Why bother paying for something when the packages show up the same time they would without Prime.  Stocks go up while the service goes down! Between @Amazon and @ups I don't know who's worse!
2431 2018-01-25 01:16:26 A1 Fact.  I think that most people find investing scares them.  GIC, mutual funds, stocks, TFSA, RRSP, RESP, different plans, different options....too many choices #InvestSmart
2432 2018-01-25 01:15:56 That stocks are riskier than real estate, or just sitting on money in a low interest savings account. Hate this myth! #investsmart
2433 2018-01-25 01:15:29 #InvestSmart I'm afraid of picking the wrong stocks and losing money is not an option
2434 2018-01-25 01:14:44 Are stocks riskier than bonds? #InvestSmart

2438 2018-01-25 01:12:34 I know you can’t read and all...but the shrinking of the economy has started. Store closings: Toys R Us, Walmart, Bon Ton, Sears, J Crew + lay offs. Stocks are high, however, unemployment rates will increase. Walmart will impact your also shrinking base the most.

2440 2018-01-25 01:11:45 A1. Fact high risk or low risk - stocks, bonds, bit coin #InvestSmart
2441 2018-01-25 01:11:13 Agreed, my brother and I were discussing diversifying today, and I echo Woo's statements. For stocks, you should hedge your bets. But for crypto I think of it like betting a horse race, you are not going to bet all the horses. Pick your studs and hope they win.
2442 2018-01-25 01:10:49 Yup. Patience is key. Sooner the shorts cover better for the stocks price . Take care
2443 2018-01-25 01:10:14 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2444 2018-01-25 01:09:02 Crypto or stocks? (Just kidding, obv both)
2445 2018-01-25 01:08:58 A1 I'd say intimidating. So many options: mutual funds, stocks, bonds, ETFs... Yikes! Where do you start? #InvestSmart
2446 2018-01-25 01:08:14 Literally killing the market. They follow what people tell them to do then panic sell when they start seeing red. How many stocks would be much higher right now if there wasn’t a major panic sell-off?

2461 2018-01-25 01:00:23 Regardless of where the #Yen goes short term... I think the #Nikkei 225 is going to make up some serious ground on U.S. Stocks after today's divergence. That being said... the $JPY is negative at the moment so all the more reason for $NKD_F to start moving higher...
2462 2018-01-25 01:00:13 essentially: this is gonna be ugly in a year or so. "BUT STOCKS AND TAX RELIEF!" some say--and yes, these look like a bright side at face value, but once you know anything about the details and start peeling the veneer, it gets a lot darker and way more complicated.

2464 2018-01-25 00:57:41 I bet 75% of Americans own stocks through 401K and IRA retirement savings accounts. What are you talking about???
2465 2018-01-25 00:57:41 The people at the table next to me are talking about how well their stocks are doing and I feel like that says a lot about the concert I’m at.

2467 2018-01-25 00:57:12 Apparently NIVIDA is telling their sales partners to maintain stocks for their gamer clientele that I don't know how they are gonna go about that. But yeah I'm hoping asscoin and friends who are fucking with the RAM & GPU markets their "money" takes a major value bath again.
2468 2018-01-25 00:54:51 There's a reason not everyone is a judge. There's also a reason we no longer put people in stocks in the public square. Somewhere along the line we decided we wanted to be better than that.
2469 2018-01-25 00:54:50 usually if you are negative on bonds you are better off just going to cash than actually shorting them. That said sometimes you have to do it :-)  It's just a harder game than shorting stocks...and that game is not very easy either.

2485 2018-01-25 00:48:11 Tried not being poor, requires lots of work. Don’t have stocks, can’t afford the luxury. Lead with values daily so maybe take a dose of your own values, like a bullet to the head. Until then, keep your hopes and prayers. Maybe you can use them as currency in this utopia of yours.

2487 2018-01-25 00:47:45 Thank you Dale but probably not a good fit for me. I run a strategy as an RIA on stocks only. I can't talk publicly about futures or forex as I'm not registered as a CTA.
2488 2018-01-25 00:46:39 Here's why that logic needs to be dropped. As with stocks, not all blockchain projects are created with good intentions. So connecting all crypto projects together just because they are based on blockchain is not healthy for the space.

2501 2018-01-25 00:38:39 I've made a 13.6% interest return rate over the last three months messing around with stocks. It's Better than a 0.01% interest return rate that you get from your bank accounts.

2503 2018-01-25 00:36:30 With all due respect, the economy DID grow, but looking solely at growth of stocks is a poor metric for overall economic growth, especially since vast majority of Americans don’t own a single share

2520 2018-01-25 00:21:01 That's right. What I did on a free week trial, I downloaded all broker data for a year or so to a spreadsheet and was picking up stocks where there was accumulation going (few brokers slowly adding up) I remember I bought this way NHL when they were at 32c.

2527 2018-01-25 00:17:08 I’m amazed people go to school to learn about investing XD. All the information you need is online. Guess what too? It’s FREE! Ps with traditional stocks you compete against super computers... unless you already have a high capital start your returns will be slow and low.

2531 2018-01-25 00:14:37 Okay so buying bonds passes on credit risk, stocks passes on ownership risk, buying tokens passes on.... what? Enterprise risk?
2532 2018-01-25 00:14:19 Low rates might stimulate spending - might not.  But Bernenke pretty much said that QE was to deprive cash a place to park in t bonds, thus pushing it to real estate & stocks.

2534 2018-01-25 00:13:57 The rich are getting more rich, that’s the numbers you see running across your stock tracker, now how much of the boost in stocks has increased your revenue? Giving the wealth back to the rich will impoverish the poor even more. The economy is in good shape but not our people.
2535 2018-01-25 00:12:57 Here and I thought you were the moron.  Hrmm, I wonder who is right.    Since stocks can also lose value would you call that compound loses too? lol
