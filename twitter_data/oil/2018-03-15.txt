15 2018-03-15 23:58:26 Try again with light peanut oil (Planters is best) or Canola Oil at only 350* fryer temp
They may require a longer frying time but at lower temp to keep from browning to quickly ;-)
16 2018-03-15 23:58:13 Very tasty with avocado oil too...

54 2018-03-15 23:56:32 HONESTLY? I’ve really like the smash box foundation I bought and it keeps oil at bay. And I’m an oily whore so
55 2018-03-15 23:56:30 Being a mechanic’s daughter has it’s perks: knowing how to check the oil, changing the tires, pumping air in the tires, and even changing the shocks.

56 2018-03-15 23:56:23 The trailer for 'My Girl 2'. I was destroyed when @AnnaChlumsky 's mood ring got dropped in oil (given to her by @IncredibleCulk). I finally saw the film a couple of years ago (in my early 30s) & found out the new love interest was only pretending! Years of anguish for nothing!

65 2018-03-15 23:55:11 That is also why of course, FDR dealt with them, as head of state, and becasue of the vast oil reserves the Saudi's were sitting on. But under Truman, the relationship morphed into a pro-Imperialist one, and the US-Saudi alliance took a darker turn, as everywhere.

75 2018-03-15 23:54:19 I totally thought u where talking about the brand of oil 
76 2018-03-15 23:54:11 Just stop burning things. It's so 0 til 1980 like. Even than its was kind of rong. But in 2018 stil burning billion of liters of oil every years ? Converting ouwer previous oxygen into co2 ? And then cutting down ouwer natural wonder filter ?

                 ____eppie____
77 2018-03-15 23:54:10 Try weekly or biweekly mask/deep condition clay. Then nightly spritz with a water/oil mix. May help with moisture and therefore manageability. Always keep it in protective style. Flat twists under a wig is perfect
78 2018-03-15 23:54:09 How about for protection from the inaction of government?
79 2018-03-15 23:53:57 These are *illustrative* figures.

86 2018-03-15 23:53:01 It allows a country of 5M to sell goods (eg: beef, whisky, fish and oil) to c.300M without any barriers and rights for them to sell here.
87 2018-03-15 23:52:48 They have found huge deposits of oil off the coast of the Falklands. The only problem is that they haven't the technology to retrieve it yet.
Do you think anyone would fight over a little island like the Falklands if there weren't an a ulteria motive.
88 2018-03-15 23:52:47 Every character was ok with me except James and Michelle. James ruined J.R.'s relationship with John Ross up until the movie and took depth away from him because he was old enough to work in Ewing Oil.
89 2018-03-15 23:52:43 Miss this show, Josh. You were one sexy beast in that oil!
90 2018-03-15 23:52:39 What if... you removed wealth disparity in those cities instead of just wiping them off the map completely? Crazy idea, I know.
91 2018-03-15 23:52:18 Losers? Hey simmer down. I've worked the gas patch, the oil sands & wood all over BC & Alb. I work now by the ocean. I'm dumbfounded that these projects are cancelled or delayed & have funded protests. Not just affecting Alberta.There's 1000's of guys ready to head back to work
92 2018-03-15 23:52:06 Forgot to mention, great illustration of the inter-relationships, BTW, but should some of the Middle East/Turkish players be included also? Money laundering, Oil, Pipelines, Oligarch new World order (The super rich vs serfs) mentality...

94 2018-03-15 23:51:42 I’m completely opposed to this Lib administration but imposing a carbon tax really isn’t that ridiculous or detrimental. Only looks bad to those relying heavily on oil and old people who are wondering why what they’ve always used is being priced more and see it as arbitrary.
95 2018-03-15 23:51:39 @FBI is gonna like that
96 2018-03-15 23:51:37 Oil my scalp so I know it's real

100 2018-03-15 23:50:48 I have and yes - Trump is ONLY about Trump so he is going to try and walk it back and over sideways and whatever he needs to do to make himself richer. He would sell snakeskin oil if he though he would get rich.
101 2018-03-15 23:50:39 My own. I'm a vegetarian and I also don't like fast food, all the oil makes me sick. I will, however, drink all the beer!
102 2018-03-15 23:50:36 Don't worry Gennaro your wrinkles will come too! Keep applying the olive oil that will help:)
103 2018-03-15 23:50:31 I vote for the wall with the tube on top. You can connect all the sections together and use it as an oil pipeline. When people try to climb on top of it you can just turn the temperature up.
104 2018-03-15 23:50:18 Trump, Obama, Bush jr, Clinton, Bush sr, other Clinton- ALL promoted war and oil/fracking and crushing the working class. What's the difference? Dems talk nicer than Trump while they screw you?
105 2018-03-15 23:49:57 Ive always said that BTC has an element of Hotelling’s rule to it - similar to oil.
106 2018-03-15 23:49:49 the dose of colors glosses aren’t plumping but have more pigment. the urban decay i find more sheer but they have peppermint oil in them which helps plump your lips. i like them both! just depends on what you’re going for
107 2018-03-15 23:49:47 Nice to hear Donald Trump Jr.'s wife got her sense of sight back. Dude is an oil spill that took human form.
108 2018-03-15 23:49:33 I think it’s good.  I replaced the 02 sensors sonhad to reset everything.  Some burning going on around there the sensors went in but it doesn’t smell like oil thank god.
109 2018-03-15 23:49:24 Cbd oil... Works like a champ. Take it daily. In the AM and before you go to bed! Anti anxiety. Doesn't make you sleepy, but easy to fall asleep and stay asleep.
110 2018-03-15 23:48:40 Olive oil, the cheapest you can get from your local supermarket.  Most importantly DO NOT use anything labelled as "Lamp Oil" it will be kerosene/paraffin and basically turn your lamp into an incendiary device.
111 2018-03-15 23:48:19 With Electric vehicle on the verge of breaking out, you can expect another oil crash. This crash will happen long before 2022 when the pipeline is planned to be finished. Kinder knows it to. It’s just a matter of time before they cancel the project

113 2018-03-15 23:48:12 It's funny how the oil didn't flow out of the bottle till it was anointed on the "least" son David's head.

What is meant for you, would never pass you by. Even if man thinks you don't deserve it, GOD would prove them wrong! HE would prepare a table in the midst of your enemies.
114 2018-03-15 23:47:41 Brian, I said this quite awhile ago, after reading Atlantic Council report to Foreign Relations Committee Nov '16, this was (is) very sophisticated conspiracy involving more than& players. Money, & access to power (oil & pipelines) too intoxicating 4 many of the players.

116 2018-03-15 23:47:17 so a helpful tip for ppl with nose piercings if u get a keloid make sure to put colgate on it every night and wash it off in the morning with sea salt water to dry the mofo out!! also apply tea tree oil at night 
117 2018-03-15 23:47:10 The only reason why they’re alive right now is because Saudi Arabia and OPEC agreed to artificially cut oil production in order to raise oil prices. KMI needs approx $50 a barrel just to break even.
118 2018-03-15 23:47:02 Why. Don't we have enough oil here. I'd like to think that cheap foreign labor has turned this country into an indigenous joke. More executives from a Continent that now knows THEIR COLOR MATTTERS. Does it get any more racist than that? Meanwhile other groups are in 
ICE hold.

122 2018-03-15 23:45:57 Booth:Talks to remove regulations for clean air and water to benefit Corp friends, how to dump Fracking waste wherever he wants, let huge farms spray toxins again, how to ignore oil spills on our beaches & the injured animals & more. No wonder he's afraid  to fly coach.
123 2018-03-15 23:45:46 Blend 2 quarts Squid  with 9 oz green beans. Add Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve on a bed of pasta
124 2018-03-15 23:45:16 Now they’re attacking the rainforests, this has to stop! Even though they may feel like you’re drowning in them, they are the beautiful! So no more rainforest destroying for oil? So very happy they sticking up for their beautiful environment!

131 2018-03-15 23:44:00 Thank you for reminding us of this. Does he ever smear oil from this gland in a cartoon?
132 2018-03-15 23:43:57 Well it was nice of the Oil industry to pay this guy to run against Paul Ryan ..he should all but guarentee Ryan to get in ... .

それより小さいなら「そういうこともあるかもしれないね」とは言っちゃうかも。私自身、それが全くの嘘だと言い切れる情報を持ってないしなぁ。
138 2018-03-15 23:42:46 You are correct. The US wants to take over European oil and gas market where Russia is a big supplier, esp. in Germany. The latest sanctions (2017) aim at pipelines from Russia to Germany. Lot going on currently to prevent a closer relationship between Germany and Russia.
139 2018-03-15 23:42:43 or - and maybe im crazy - you could raise the GPT higher than the minuscule 2.7% it is currently at and make the multi-billion dollar oil industry pay its fair share. Even if you cut half of OKs superintendents, you arent even scratching the surface of the needed funding.

142 2018-03-15 23:42:40 Agreed. I don’t think anything besides drugs and gross production (oil) should see increases in tax percentage. I don’t trust anyone at the capital and until they can prove responsibility with tax dollars I’ll never vote yes on any tax increase except for those two things.
143 2018-03-15 23:42:39 Started taking CBD oil for sleep but it makes me hungry as fuck??? Now it's  1 am and instead of sleeping I'm in bed thinking about French fries
144 2018-03-15 23:42:38 Don't forget about the fact you can get new tires and an oil change there too!

146 2018-03-15 23:42:15 Your skin is too pretty to be spanked. More like rubbed with oil.
147 2018-03-15 23:42:08 The inability of these idiots to grasp the concept of self defense against criminals and defense against tyranny in a world literally full of tyranny is mind blowing. Like those zoo animals that refuse to mate, they are too dumb to possibly survive for long.

152 2018-03-15 23:41:37 you have amazing skin and yes I'm extremely jealous. All those years of using baby oil and iodine is catching up to me.
153 2018-03-15 23:41:08 Oh, and on top of that all land used for the Oil Sands actually has to be reclaimed to nature by law. Glad I could help inform you on things work out here. Think about that the next time you feel like saying something stupid.
154 2018-03-15 23:41:07 Too bad they don't fight for taxpayers the way they fight for big oil. Sad!
155 2018-03-15 23:41:04 No and I just put water tea tree oil and this lol. You can reapply and don’t even have to wet your hair
156 2018-03-15 23:41:04 I disagree with you because you are cherry picking GERS figures which are demonstrative and not real revenue allocations to ScotGov!
The geographic share is notional, not actual.
I ask again: did ScotGov receive ~£11bn in revenues from Oil & Gas in 2010-2011?

164 2018-03-15 23:40:06 More than 50 of GDP but they have already deals with Russia and other allies that gove food for oil so not so much about bad decisions. It's not an example on anything really. As long as you keep buying they don't care. Not a good excuse
165 2018-03-15 23:39:56 if I took my oil to get changed my oil life on my car should be at 100%... right?????
166 2018-03-15 23:39:39 It wouldn't surprise me (nor disappoint me overly much).

170 2018-03-15 23:38:37 The vast majority of Canada’s pollution comes from Alberta in the process of getting our oil to market. Not complaining bc we all benefit economically but that is the reason Michelle is so opposed. She’s acting politically more than rationally.

175 2018-03-15 23:37:55 Hello person who doesn’t actually live in Alberta. Just to let you know the Oil sands makes a very small portion of Alberta with the rest looking just fine and pollution free for the most part. Oh, and someone from New York shouldn’t be giving us crap for pollution. Glass Houses.

182 2018-03-15 23:36:37 yes shipbuilding is important which is why the potential loss of it ought to have been aired, that's being prudent not threatening

193 2018-03-15 23:34:49 In terms of removing makeup, a natural oil and pads works much better for me (I guess this depends on how much you wear). Light oils like almond, coconut, avocado or walnut are all lovely and you can just dab it on and wipe straight off - and it also doubles as a moisturiser

The second was lies about WMD and that was only about oil too.
Remember Saddam was put in there by the US/UK.

199 2018-03-15 23:33:52 I love this but since the US is planning to take over the European Oil/Gas market, the Plan is to sanction Russia to death. Trump has made the US the #1 exporter the only problem is the Russians sell it cheaper and they're already there.
200 2018-03-15 23:33:37 fun fact: cooking like they do in the movies gets hot oil all over your hands
201 2018-03-15 23:33:27 No, that's different. If you're talking about Canada prioritizing using its own oil over foreign imports, that's a whole other conversation, and a complicated one because these new pipelines we're talking about are expressly for export.
202 2018-03-15 23:33:26 I think it’s ironic that my dad is a risk engineer employed by companies like Valero, the money from which my dad uses to pay for me to go to college. So oil companies are paying for my environmental science degree.
203 2018-03-15 23:33:20 It's too bad none of this is for the citizens. Big oil controls all the politicians in this province. They do what big oil want. You think the carbon tax has any effect on their finances?

267 2018-03-15 23:25:19 Also, there is no guarantee that oil prices will shoot back up. The DIA spokesman says only that the wells in question "may" become profitable again. The auditor is the city's watchdog.

277 2018-03-15 23:24:20 Congrats! I suppose answering her with "BOOM" wouldn't be appropriate.
278 2018-03-15 23:24:04 Let me explain the headline: It's asking if the money-losing wells should be shut, not all of 'em. This is what the audit, and the city auditor, is asking. It's not our "spin." I reached out to DIA, so their response and the dose of context about oil prices is up high.
279 2018-03-15 23:24:03 Note that the years 2010/2011 do not match.
In that year, ScotGov was awarded less than £1bn in revenues from Oil & Gas, yet there's a huge discrepancy from what UK gov declares (about £10bn) and what the estimated Total Tax Contributions of those industries really bring in.
280 2018-03-15 23:23:58 Plus the money they make from making all those weapons, probably want to steal Russia’s oil and gas etc?
281 2018-03-15 23:23:54 Candidate @ErikMUnderwood: the elephant in the room is TABOR. Enough with the insanity. We need rail, we are not compensating for growth. I will not sell public lands to oil and gas or any other entity. We need to be stewards of our land and the character of our state.

284 2018-03-15 23:23:33 @fema omitting climate change doesn’t mean it’s not happening.  It’s what happens when there’s excessive CO2 in the atmosphere due to fossil fuels -like oil! #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsReal #climatechange #ThisAdminIs4Dolts
285 2018-03-15 23:23:17 thank you for this tweet it actually reminded me to take my fish oil and vitamins etc
286 2018-03-15 23:23:00 They have released a remastered version. I lived next to the oil refinery in Grangemouth at the time and it scared the bejesus out of me.
287 2018-03-15 23:22:56 You've arrived.
288 2018-03-15 23:22:30 Funny..@Statoil are embarrassed enough to remove 'oil' from their name, but not embarrassed enough to plan to remove 'oil' from their business..
289 2018-03-15 23:22:29 If you make buttered noodles with butter made with olive oil it's healthy, right?

Made even healthier by piling on the parmesan.
290 2018-03-15 23:22:10 Changbaishan frogs are the best frogs*. I WILL NOT HEAR OTHERWISE!

*I mean, I guess. Personally I don't care for frog, and I am unsure what health benefits frog oil may confer. I did give my whole family Essence of Bullfrog as stocking stuffers one xmas. They were not amused..
291 2018-03-15 23:21:25 Because Venezuela made oil and gas their major export (95%) and too high a proportion of the GDP (50%) and it is their only leverage with other countries, they make really bad deals. A small dip in price can be disaster. Shows why Canada should not be looking to expand.

294 2018-03-15 23:21:05 we had steamed kale & broccoli, marinated* tempeh, sundried toms, 3 onions, garlic, cumin seeds, (*fresh ginger, *fresh lime juice x 2, *leftover beetroot vinegar), olive oil, mushrooms, mixed herbs, coconut oil.  Alas, no pic (no camera) but it looked like Saag & tasted bright x
295 2018-03-15 23:20:58 I shall invest in oil companies to offset my transportation costs, FANG to earn back my data, and REITs to offset rising rents.

Person working: we have olive oil and vinaigrette

Me: you want me to spray olive oil all over someone’s face tonight?

303 2018-03-15 23:19:50 Ate shrimp scampi for dinner as it used to be a fave. Haven’t eaten it in 25 years & yuck! It’s eating shrimp with an olive oil chaser.

309 2018-03-15 23:18:51 Export capacity maybe up but exports are not (they have effectively flat lined). For me it says demand is not there, even with as you say more export capacity and more oil available for export. Supply is only one side of the equation.

311 2018-03-15 23:18:35 President Perez in 1988 started the diversification by closing ALL imports as a mandate from the IMF. Chavez staged a coup in 1992. But in that short period of time Venezuela had increased GDP not related to oil by 30%. We also manufactured 70% of internal food consumption.

314 2018-03-15 23:18:11 Hey brother, dunno if you hit the herb but if you can get some CBD oil off a friend it's great for back pains and reducing inflammation. I use it on my hands to help with RSI. Apart from that the doctor can prescribe Baclofen which is a non-controlled muscle relaxant.
315 2018-03-15 23:18:10 That was honestly the most disappointing auto show I've experienced in a while. I miss when Calgary was rolling in $120/barrel oil money

322 2018-03-15 23:17:12 Portman did a ton of research. Apparently it was popular bc peanut butter was so dry back then before they added oil into the jar. You needed grease to moisten it. And disgust future generations and who would get you posthumously into garden and gun.

328 2018-03-15 23:16:09 You can't turn your head and pretend that doesn't happen or affect you just because is not on canadian soil. The best you can do to this poor planet is stop buying oil from them.

345 2018-03-15 23:13:37 It happens.
346 2018-03-15 23:13:17 yesss I had heard of that before so try to keep my skin moisturised with oil based cleansers (oskia renaissance gel, clinique take the day off balm) and use rosehip oil a couple of times a week too! nothing seems to help hahah
347 2018-03-15 23:13:15 I always get sick after I eat that kale salad  but it’s good! Just doesn’t agree with the oil that’s in it
348 2018-03-15 23:13:08 Fox News taps into the fear of conservatives like an oil rig. They know exactly what, where, and when to hit the fear-mongering points. #tytlive
349 2018-03-15 23:12:31 After watching and greatly enjoying your show, I've decided to suggest you try using peanut oil as a skin moisturizer. Maybe carry some with you in a travel safe bottle....flying can be very dehydrating for the skin. #ifit'sfunnysayit
350 2018-03-15 23:12:22 Every temperature. Of the fryer oil, of the steak coming out of the oven, of the shower water, of your partner when they’re feeling sick. Just check.

353 2018-03-15 23:12:11 @realDonaldTrump @brithume @BretBaier sanctions on Russia aren't going to do much. President Trump's energy policy and exporting as much LNG and oil to Europe and the Eastern Bloc will destroy Russia US Energy is for President Trump what Star Wars was for President Reagan
354 2018-03-15 23:12:08 I think so.

I generally scrub down with dawn dish detergent mixed with baking soda with a few drops of lemon oil mixed in.  Then I shower off.  It’s messy

I also sometimes do the bleach bath or a baking soda bath with 1 cup of vinegar and dawn

Depends on how disgusting I feel
355 2018-03-15 23:12:06 As not being a pedophile. I would not notice.
356 2018-03-15 23:12:00 Okay #beautygurus have y’all tried the @SunKissAlba @derma_e radiant glow face oil?
357 2018-03-15 23:11:51 Drove past Sonic, Burger King, Wendy’s, Taco Bell and every other delicious, greasy place just to go home and eat corn (no butter), scrambled eggs (with olive oil spray), fat free cheese, and a light English muffin. My life is over.

359 2018-03-15 23:11:25 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

362 2018-03-15 23:11:12 "only hot chicks can insist on not getting shot while in school" is a spectacularly bad take on the topic.

373 2018-03-15 23:10:06 They also cry poor to avoid the raises while giving huge tax breaks to the oil industry.
374 2018-03-15 23:10:05 @SantiagoCuneo por favor preguntar a Aranguren que va a hacer con Oil Refinería San Lorenzo
375 2018-03-15 23:10:04 The same fate awaits countries like Mexico whose economy depends 50% on oil revenues. Once Cantarell reserves dry it will be difficult.
376 2018-03-15 23:10:00 Well, when you factor that Russia has blown through reserves and hit up the "welfare fund", can't invest in declining oil and gas fields, relies heavily on EU as market, which is diversifying energy suppliers, rise of liquified natural gas, not much.
377 2018-03-15 23:09:57 Maybe you needed an oil sponsor....
378 2018-03-15 23:09:52 I've never tried oil, but I keep it always neat... But will you recommend an oil to me?
379 2018-03-15 23:09:52 Follow the Exxon oil deal trail in Russia this was a farce firing

389 2018-03-15 23:08:34 Eighteen months after September 11th, an oil tanker exploded a few miles from my house. Shook the entire island, knocked stuff over and sent up an ominous purple cloud. We were packing to head somewhere safe when it was confirmed not to be terrorism.
390 2018-03-15 23:08:29 Oil paintings only. Got it.
391 2018-03-15 23:08:28 Bleach is an essential oil
392 2018-03-15 23:08:24 I'm afraid I was already a hardened skeptic and drove around with a sign in my van back window saying "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's oil" and got lots of supportive toots from other motorists.
393 2018-03-15 23:08:10 New engine is leaking oil from the main seal and now vapor locks randomly. That’s just lovely. Great. Wonderful.
394 2018-03-15 23:08:00 Yeah... I won’t take anything unless either I or someone trustworthy has researched it and there is actual science rather than just hype behind it. I’m currently the best I have been in years. Not letting some quack with snake oil take that away from me.

396 2018-03-15 23:07:53 Canadian oil is dirty, way dirtier than other oils.
397 2018-03-15 23:07:30 Then why did you approve the Keystone Pipeline? It's Canadian oil going to ports to ship elsewhere?

405 2018-03-15 23:06:44 He has hired almost exclusively Goldman sachs execs, big oil business men and various career politicians. He is not a man of the people. Never has been, never will be, and is personally guilty of fraud, corruption and collusion. It wasn't a swamp before, but it 100% is now.
406 2018-03-15 23:06:31 Venezuelan oil is an ecological tragedy. They sign or honor no agreement. I lived within the largest refinery there. You wouldn't believe the mess I've seen.

408 2018-03-15 23:06:24 Yup. Cities in red states have the highest murder rates.
409 2018-03-15 23:06:23 Oil beetles have been very under-recorded in the past, several major hotspots have only recently come to light because some species are winter-active plus nocturnal, others peak now before much else has got going, plus they love really isolated spots.

414 2018-03-15 23:05:48 I don't really see how you can separate the two. He's been an enthusiastic climate denier and recipient of oil money. He cut deals to rob native americans of their lands and sell them at fire sale prices to the mining firms. He's just Trump without the swearing and over racism.
415 2018-03-15 23:05:42 My engine oil and water temps were in the red when the first caution finally came out, and I think I only got two seconds of 48 seconds of damage actually repaired over the course of the race. So that was the price I had to pay for whoever jumped the curb
416 2018-03-15 23:05:37 Oooo emmmm geeee....those are cities? Another victim of colon cramps induced by attempting to think.
417 2018-03-15 23:05:17 As a canadian if trump imposes a tariff and gets totally out of NAFTA; how about Ont and Que shut off the power to the northeast. and alb shut off the oil how long until they come begging to us for that power. $53b in power and 3.3m barrels of oil per day. MORON   #tytlive

422 2018-03-15 23:04:18 Louisiana is a republican controlled state. So is Michigan. Maryland also has a Republican Governor. NYC isn’t anywhere near the top in homicide rates.
423 2018-03-15 23:04:12 Maybe don't put peppermint oil on top of makeup.
424 2018-03-15 23:04:08 It isn't going to be "sudden". Besides, you can make electricity from oil so...
425 2018-03-15 23:04:06 I don't see the big deal.  

Although, I would have likely put it as "3 of these 4 will likely die alone and be eaten by their 37 cats"

426 2018-03-15 23:04:04 I don’t believe in puffery - @MichelleRempel is not “one of the best” MP’s she is the best MP. Tweet and RT her. Compared to CDN O&G, how much tax is being charged on foreign oil? How much on cement factories, how much on dumping sewage?
427 2018-03-15 23:03:59 Not true. Chavez in his Socialism utopia choked free market enterprises. Businesses filed for bankruptcy in the thousands until the only revenue was oil. And then oil prices collapsed.

429 2018-03-15 23:03:42 P buat scalp treatment ke apa. Argan oil tu dkt farmasi, watson, guardian tu ada
430 2018-03-15 23:03:33 Not the same thing but several years ago an oil depot near me exploded and the blast caused this rushing wind that shook my whole house, knocked tiles off our roof, woke me up and I thought the world was ending. 
431 2018-03-15 23:03:31 Correction: "Government" -> "Oil companies" (present USA government denies #AGW)
Korjaus: "Hallinnon" -> "Öljy-yhtiöiden" (Suomenkin hallitus on ilmastotoimissaan melkoisen tieteenvastainen)

434 2018-03-15 23:03:09 Getting Block is easy naa but the oil is the one that'll be a bit difficult sir. Which of the oil do you want? Olive? Palm oil? Or Groundnut oil? Let me know ASAP sir. Lol
435 2018-03-15 23:02:56 The Putin regime is a gangster capitalist but why should we pay attention to the former boss of Yukos? #Newsnight He looted the state run oil industry while millions of Russian workers saw living standards collapse. But Western powers love him because he fell out with Putin.
436 2018-03-15 23:02:43 Oooh sounds good! It could help. Peppermint body products might even help. Magnesium also helps my headaches. So a salty peppermint bath might help lol. 
Wintergreen is also a great oil for pain. If you ever have any oil questions, I’m here. I don’t sell, just tried A LOT haha.
437 2018-03-15 23:02:37 True to form. Oil man running the EPA. Private school elitist running the Department of Education....
438 2018-03-15 23:02:34 Dudes steadily worried about their girl cheating in Miami, yet she's been cheating on you all year with a dude who has a GED and works at a Jiffy Lube doing oil changes.
439 2018-03-15 23:02:34 #tytlive You know, if the US is so concerned about the trade deficit, Canada should just sell all it's oil to China instead.  Would that be better for you America?

444 2018-03-15 23:02:12 I am saddened to have had this sentence in my life.
445 2018-03-15 23:02:08 "Washington is waging economic war against a nation that dared to rise up and reject U.S. control over its ample oil reserves."

Wrong. The US is Venezuela's #1 trading partner. You don't know anything.
446 2018-03-15 23:01:57 All the money and almost all the men who attacked us on Sept 11 came from Saudi Arabia.They sponsor wahhabism.They undermine our oil industry and kill wahhabism civilians.They're not our ally but a massive risk to our country.  I think the military industrial complex has it wrong
447 2018-03-15 23:01:49 Yes fats like coconut oil, avocado, nuts and seeds, olive oil, flax seeds, coconut cream, grass-fed butter those are all very healthy fats

450 2018-03-15 23:01:13 Can anyone protest, insult, etc Trump or the right without using profanity or is their vocabulary just that limited?
451 2018-03-15 23:00:56 I don’t need to read up on Trump.  I have seen his nonsense since the 80’s.  He’s a glorified snake oil salesman.

454 2018-03-15 23:00:41 Hi @jkenney I understand that you want to turn off the taps for oil and gas into the Province of BC! If you think for one second that's going to help in the nations interest your wrong, it only further isolates the problem and only strengthens the @bcndp & @BCGreens!

462 2018-03-15 22:59:03 Why does an oil change for my car cost so much
463 2018-03-15 22:59:02 Use an oil base makeup remover or balm and it will loosen the glue. It’s not as satisfying but it might save the rest of your natural lashes.
464 2018-03-15 22:58:48 anyway let me tell yall black seed oil....miracle worker...

470 2018-03-15 22:57:46 The oil industry's top lobbying group is holding a two-day meeting at Trump International Hotel before heading to the White House today to press its concerns on steel tariffs, patronizing his business could be viewed as a way to try to influence Trump.
471 2018-03-15 22:57:44 May have a slight obsession with coconut oil products
472 2018-03-15 22:57:40 Thanks Mike. What do you mean about critics that don't work - you mean in the oil industry?

489 2018-03-15 22:55:49 2005 Honda Accord. I troubleshooted it, and I’m guessing it’s a bad filter since I got an oil change and they said I have a minor leakage

543 2018-03-15 22:47:46 I think it’s a good idea for chemical plants and oil and gas companies to share and coordinate disaster response plans with local law enforcement and first responders. Just today, a chemical plant explosion killed someone in Texas.

557 2018-03-15 22:46:37 @realDonaldTrump  Russia needs to be dealt with effectively. An international effort to depress the oil price permanently will put Putin back in the box
558 2018-03-15 22:46:33 The photo of @chrisleask with the oil painting does rather spoiler one of the best reveals of the show!

579 2018-03-15 22:44:30 Stop destroying Our Country's Lands We don't want filthy oil anymore We have clean renewable energy sources for the entire Country  which will create jobs jobs jobs  Real jobs not fake ones as reported by McConnell and Ryan
580 2018-03-15 22:44:29 Probably me too lol. Funny how libs have so much trouble with facts and humor.
581 2018-03-15 22:44:26 Oh no!! I'm sorry it didn't do much for you. I was eyeing the iconic serum. I hope you figure out what combination works for you. I also looked at the witches brew toner for the tea tree oil combo as I read a girl say she used it with the SSS.
582 2018-03-15 22:44:25 If the Middle East didn’t have oil would we even be there?
583 2018-03-15 22:44:25 No , Thatcher jumped into bed with Bush over something that was fuck all to do with us . Maybe the oil was a factor eh ?
584 2018-03-15 22:44:23 Bull shit Senator Frank
Why have Comrade he espionage sanctions not been enforced?
Now that Europe has stood alone Trump @DeanHeller & you finally enforce part of them
Toughen the sanction
Confiscate Russian properties, bank accounts assets
Embargo Russian oil, vodka, diamonds
585 2018-03-15 22:44:20 I don’t really follow recipes. Just chicken,garlic, penzey herbs,carrots, onions, celery, peoper and olive oil. Going to serve it with lemon
586 2018-03-15 22:44:16 $xom hasn't been this low since 08-10 oil. Lot of value here with the dividend. Plus I feel as though they are big enough and have enough seeds in other avenues to be the energy company of the future. Feel safe buying and holding this for the next decade or 3.

590 2018-03-15 22:43:57 @Nigel_Farage Russia needs to be dealt with effectively. An international effort to reduce the price of oil over the longer term will put Russia back in the box through the hit to its economy
591 2018-03-15 22:43:53 Romantic setting : Candle lights (or Christmas lights), oil burners with mad perfume oil , AC cooling , light music and food while the lights are switched off . And of course no disturbance 
592 2018-03-15 22:43:48 Austin is spoiled with excellent ice cream. @LickIceCreams has Dark Chocolate, Olive Oil & Sea Salt as well as Goat Cheese, Thyme & Honey as two of its regular flavors. Not to mention horchata. I can verify all of them are amazing.

The guys who drove it in pushed the seat back to normal people height.
607 2018-03-15 22:41:58 Loved this video! But you didn't use olive oil! Haha I  you!
608 2018-03-15 22:41:56 Where was your FIGHT for Alberta oil before, during and after Energy East??? My guess it was a back door deal with Trudeau, and you knew it was going to be blocked. Your an embarrassment to Alberta, Trudeau’s little gullible puppet.
609 2018-03-15 22:41:52 But I got this oil change for $20 though! That's what I'm talking about

614 2018-03-15 22:40:34 I lived in a truck travelling all over europe in the 70’s.
Then I flew out to Nigeria on my own and lived there for a while travelling all over. Delivering and setting up an oil refinery in Kaduna. Working with christian and islamic peoples. Best time of my life.

617 2018-03-15 22:40:30 You had windfall oil money. Balancing the books based on windfalls isn't responsible, contrary to what many in Alberta claim.
618 2018-03-15 22:40:19 Gotcha Lott!
619 2018-03-15 22:40:16 @BorisJohnson  why is it that Russia with a small economy  is able to punch above its weight. The measures taken yesterday are just fiddling around the edges. What is required is a long term strategic plan to degrade Russia by an international effort to reduce the oil price.

624 2018-03-15 22:39:50 I've been gaping cbd oil for a few months. My medicine has, more or less, gradually stopped helping me manage my pain, anxiety, and bi-polar issues. I go through about 10ml a day with around 1250mg oil. I haven't really even felt it take the edge off.
625 2018-03-15 22:39:26 The guy who changed my oil helped me put my license plate and windshield wipers on  bless him lol
626 2018-03-15 22:38:42 It says on my bottle to take 35 drops of the oil for a full dose, but I just took 18 drops. So maybe half a dose will be better. I only took 8 drops on the first try. Glad it's working for you!
627 2018-03-15 22:38:35 Wow....Uninformed. There is no sand left in the Bitumen/Oil. It is diluted with a diluent (Naptha)...Just wow the stupid stuff on here about Canada's oil....We are being hosed. The government's of both spectrums been bending us all over for a long time.

634 2018-03-15 22:37:40 i just chop some brussel sprout and sweet potatoes, then drizzle some olive oil on then, and season with salt, pepper, thyme, and garlic power.
i cook the veggies and salmon all on one baking sheet and just make sure they’re separated.
set the oven to 425°

651 2018-03-15 22:36:00 I task it that's sarcasm! After the oil & gas has been extracted, the countryside will be restored to it's original condition. Compare that to the unsightly wind turbines & solar panels that will blight the countryside till they rust & decay.

705 2018-03-15 22:29:05 I remember reading about a mother/son team that kite-skiied across Antarctica on a diet of olive oil and (I believe) peanut butter. Apparently it takes a while for your digestive tract to adapt to absorbing that much oil.

709 2018-03-15 22:28:56 I am truly on the fence on this issue and would welcome more info on the economics of it.  Are you suggesting that we won't be able to sell dirty oil from BC because Indian and Chinese buyers will prefer the Florida port?

711 2018-03-15 22:28:50 I always love it when I use deep hair conditioner and the result is drier hair than ever. Why do I even bother, I should just dump more olive oil in it. Also, I think winter is making things worse. Last year sesame oil did wonders but now it gives me dry hair as well. :/
712 2018-03-15 22:28:49 Put two drops lavender oil on your feet. Works for me.

714 2018-03-15 22:28:34 Car wash oil change and nails done   productive afternoon
715 2018-03-15 22:28:26 Oh settle down, I was figuratively jerking off to your fawning over fucking healthcare, being “safe” and paid time off. And, please stop with the fake “I hate America” shit.
716 2018-03-15 22:28:18 Because, Oklahomans are tired of the richest industry in the history of the planet freeloading in our state at the expense of our children and elderly. Sales tax is regressive. Oil & Gas needs to pay their fair share.
717 2018-03-15 22:28:07 @NPR I heard something about china issuing yuan based oil futures recently.
718 2018-03-15 22:28:04 We wouldn't call that whiskey or even whisky this side of the pond. My favourite fact is that the American bourbon industry helped keep the fledgling floundering oil industry alive.
719 2018-03-15 22:28:03 #UKOG #DOR #ANGUS Anyone who thinks we don't need our own oil and gas now is a traitor imo.
720 2018-03-15 22:27:30 Bullshit. US citizens are sold a chest thumping, faux patriotic dream by millionaire snake oil salesmen. You're as free as a Russian. That's why Trump so admires Putin. The dream that the founding fathers had has be corrupted and you don't see it.
721 2018-03-15 22:27:28 Cook w butter or olive oil?
722 2018-03-15 22:27:27 Bitch I’m classy I make so much now. Coconut oil trash for that.
723 2018-03-15 22:27:15 Yep well said! We haven’t paid crazy money for individuals & since most are young we won’t have to spend much to keep the team ticking over. And this is earned not paid for with oil or raised by selling shares!!
724 2018-03-15 22:27:01 Flipping hell mate you gotta deep condition that ish for a good 2 days. Dash some deep conditioner add some oil and water in a bag with the hair. Microwave you know pshhh 
725 2018-03-15 22:26:58 i used oil to “soak” mine with a cotton pad and slowly pull them off and i only lost a couple of lashes lol
726 2018-03-15 22:26:44 For every barrel of oil private enterprise brings into the country 5 barrels of oil are exported by private enterprise 

You're entire line of reasoning is nonsense. 

The only way you could change this would be to nationalize the industry.
727 2018-03-15 22:26:38 When you have an ear infection, and you put your earbuds in, but then you remember you have essential oil in there
728 2018-03-15 22:26:08 That's why you buy Canadian oil dirt cheap and sell it back at triple value right
729 2018-03-15 22:25:55 I do as a cleanser along with alcohol free witch hazel follow up with raw shea butter, organic coconut oil and vitamin e oil
730 2018-03-15 22:25:45 That oil change got my car driving like brand new

736 2018-03-15 22:24:31 Jamaican Black Castor Oil! It will help your lashes bounce back. It would have also helped to remove the lash adhesive.. lol.
737 2018-03-15 22:24:17 See, that's interesting.  In my career, it was often the opposite.  We ended up drilling in the gassier areas 1st simply because they tended to produce at higher rates (both oil and gas).  Higher porosity/perm.  Often higher structurally (slightly).
738 2018-03-15 22:24:17 Got my oil changed, filled up with gas, my trucks happy af but my bank account she's feeling it.
739 2018-03-15 22:24:03 Be sure and stop by for a tune-up and oil change before any last minute Spring Break roadtrips!

741 2018-03-15 22:23:53 Why would overseas trade dependence on foreign coal and oil to dependence on foreign gas?  India especially is moving on past.  In the end it will be a market decision and govt interference will not change the outcome.  LNG Canada now wants significant concessions to go ahead.
742 2018-03-15 22:23:45 @CBCTerry  How can you let Stockwell Day get away with an absolute falsehood on P&P.  It is NOT processed oil, it is toxic diluted bitumen that will be going through that #pipeline.   @CBCNews  You owe BC an apology #bcpoli

744 2018-03-15 22:23:20 Imagining where anythng is with over-production.  That is a uniform economic law, not unique to oil production. OPEC+ IS restricting supply, that is the reality.

751 2018-03-15 22:21:56 I thought McGovern was great, the military draft was terrible and that extracting oil from shale would destroy the planet.

762 2018-03-15 22:20:02 I guess you're just supposed to let them come off naturally.. I put some coconut oil on mine and pulled them all out, my lashes and all.. bad bad bad

764 2018-03-15 22:19:36 PSA: cinnamon essential oil smells truly awful and the scent of it makes me feel sick now. Why is this oil full of lies? You smell nothing like cinnamon. You smell like barf.

767 2018-03-15 22:19:06 We are five days in and I think noticing some relief/differences. We have been doing the oil and I will keep him on it, I think. We got some dog treats today (easier for in laws while we vacation in a couple weeks) that we are anxious to try. Thanks again for the tip!

770 2018-03-15 22:18:36 Better question for @TSXcapital. Professionally, I'm strictly conventional and heavy oil. I'm just an enthusiastic spectator of shale.
771 2018-03-15 22:18:23 Just think, if you hadn't approved the Keystone pipeline we wouldn't be importing so much Canadian oil.

794 2018-03-15 22:14:00 So you would prefer oil from a country with no environmental or human rights regulations and no requirements to try and produce clean ethical product like Canada. Lets just give them a pass? I don't think so.
795 2018-03-15 22:13:53 My CBD oil came. It makes my skin not hurt!
796 2018-03-15 22:13:51 That whole bowl is 270 calories and only because I used too much oil.

812 2018-03-15 22:12:13 I'm not a liberal, try again.
813 2018-03-15 22:12:13 Not difficult to assign a value to foreign oil production emissions. Canadians are very familiar with extraction process in those countries, in fact thousands of Canadian oil workers are there working in those fields.
814 2018-03-15 22:12:13 Not gonna lie, I’m actually extremely impressed at the service I received at the Grease & Go in Glassboro for an oil change + new air filter  10/10 recommend
815 2018-03-15 22:12:02 All I want is to get the smell of motor oil out of my hair 
816 2018-03-15 22:11:44 Yup. Told you haha I cook almost everything in it. It's so easy to clean and use that it makes sense. And since I don't really need to use oil for anything it just makes it much better for everyone. Plus I'm lazy, so not having to shake stuff all the time is a massive plus 
817 2018-03-15 22:11:40 Lol at cheap oil and electricity

819 2018-03-15 22:11:27 @BobFergusonAG Could you please explain to Zinke why he doesn't want to go here. With the threat of earthquakes and eco-disasters from oil drilling on the West Coast, I am sure it won't be hard to convince a judge the sole purpose of this plan is for Trump to punish Blue states.

859 2018-03-15 22:07:04 I want the world to smell like tea tree oil
860 2018-03-15 22:06:57 You’re Right!!! I work in the field. He also reduced safety on oil rigs!  May increase accidents and spills. If ALL companies did the right thing there would be no need for regs! Take them away & not all, but some will forget about protecting workers & the environment.
861 2018-03-15 22:06:48 Are u using the morrocan oil 4 hair?
862 2018-03-15 22:06:46 I actually rarely drink but always bring liquor to a get-together or if I'm having people over. If anything the only thing I really put into my body these days is CBD oil.
863 2018-03-15 22:06:43 Trump is so ignorant he can't even anticipate the embarrassment of his own ignorance. DK in flesh.

"A lot of people don't know ...":

- France/ally
- WJClinton/Nafta
- VAT
- oil in Iraq
- co$t of war
etc
864 2018-03-15 22:06:42 Glad you're back in one piece anyway. 

I've never seen the oil cos. so emboldened up here in the San Juan Basin. We're not the Permian, thank God, but believe me, it ain't pretty.
865 2018-03-15 22:06:34 Trump's ability to analyze a complex situation like the opioid crisis is about as deep as an oil slick on a mud puddle.  The man's an idiot and dangerous.
866 2018-03-15 22:06:27 Oil dey ur head...
867 2018-03-15 22:06:20 CBD oil. The hemp version.
868 2018-03-15 22:05:55 Trust me when I say, this city side, this season are something else, it's hard admitting it as a die hard united fan but they really are the most incredible oil powered machine. Very very close to peps Barca level, but they spent a lot more money. Silva and de bruyne incredible
869 2018-03-15 22:05:50 Oil, beans. Put 2 and 2 together
870 2018-03-15 22:05:41 Im sad af that they made my car synthetic oil only 
871 2018-03-15 22:05:35 Perhaps ROI is something Oil & Gas does (relatively) well for #HPC - if everyone could know/share/show the true "value" of calculations done, we would have a lot more HPC...?
872 2018-03-15 22:05:33 Ooh maybe i'll try that after the morroccan oil..
873 2018-03-15 22:05:32 For our first major paper in comp II, many of my peers chose to write about the legalizing of pot and why oil spills are a big deal. Me? I wrote about Star Wars 
874 2018-03-15 22:04:46 Regime Change in Iran is the ONLY solution for Iran and for the Middle East region. The flow of billions of dollars of oil money to the regime is the worst thing that can happen. The sooner the regime is gone the sooner stability and peace will come to the region.
875 2018-03-15 22:04:34 The only oil to use!!!
876 2018-03-15 22:04:27 I am genuinely suspecting @DrJoeAbah because of his questions today. Baby boy is up to something. Oil blocks to owning a bank. Ok.
877 2018-03-15 22:04:08 Geranium essential oil is life !! Literally my acne scars has been clearing
878 2018-03-15 22:04:08 Oh nah lol. I used that stuff when I first went natural cause my hair was hella short. Couldnt take the smell...switched to Jamaican black Castor oil + tea tree oil
879 2018-03-15 22:04:00 are you looking for bud? got some oil cartridges for u at the very least my man. xx ha, will be at show tonight.
880 2018-03-15 22:03:23 Sorry if that’s not you in that costume. Guy in your picture is basically a little kid playing cowboy
881 2018-03-15 22:03:21 Recession that he put us in? Out of recession but the manufacturing sector declined? Where is the diversification he clamoured for? We are still at the mercy of oil price.
882 2018-03-15 22:03:03 In need of a oil change
883 2018-03-15 22:03:01 He's a snake oil salesman, and says what his audience wants to hear!
884 2018-03-15 22:02:59 when the oil 
baron becomes the good guy it's all gone wrong
885 2018-03-15 22:02:56 no, I just eat it along with coconut oil then enjoy my cold brew with heavy cream and stevia
886 2018-03-15 22:02:52 So ladies in my 'assumed demographic', are you getting lots of friend requests from 'our' age men who work in oil? Or is it just me?

889 2018-03-15 22:01:58 Aquafor, Vaseline, olive oil, or coconut oil will all help the hair grow back! If you have acne prone skin though don’t use olive or coconut oil on your face.
890 2018-03-15 22:01:41 Oh, and I have a husband, and a house I paid for, too. 


You want a pissing contest, you triggered lunatic, raise your fucking skirt.
891 2018-03-15 22:01:29 How about water and oil heaters? Нет таких в СА?
892 2018-03-15 22:01:24 I got their Marula oil and t didn't smell bad.. good for hair tho wouldn't use it for face... their hyaluronic acid is truly the bomb tho!!
893 2018-03-15 22:01:18 Should bring in the oil union people and scientists to discuss with the people who are so set on pushing this pipeline through.
894 2018-03-15 22:00:41 Hey Chuppy, glad to see you here,  I liked your EWT posts and miss them since you were not very welcome by the analysts.   in this post you have "oil esp".  what do you mean by esp, is it especially.  TIA
895 2018-03-15 22:00:35 Politics and actual leadership go together like oil and water.
896 2018-03-15 22:00:31 If Republicans get the rest of their tar-sand oil pipeline built, that should help Canada a bit with their US trade deficit.
897 2018-03-15 22:00:30 How many wars have we been involved in that are so obviously about oil resources kill millions of poor people but let’s not think about that Netflix streaming good shows tonight

900 2018-03-15 22:00:12 OIL DIFF: 3.87 -> 3.95
901 2018-03-15 22:00:09 you can replace oil with biofuel but you can't replace clean water with anything else
902 2018-03-15 22:00:07 I believe the figure is about 97% but that's among climatologists. It goes down when you include all scientists. One reason you don't hear more about it is that publishing findings on cc triggers immediate lawsuits from big oil. Sure they're frivolous but expensive to fight.

I need to get myself to Nissan for my oil change appt. 
that I'm due for. | #Adulting
916 2018-03-15 21:58:16 Floated this theory out to Sturm, feels like his agent is on the metaphorical corner selling snake oil to anyone who will listen. Canfora loves some click bait....
917 2018-03-15 21:58:13 Filled up my gas tank, put oil and coolant in my car, cleaned out my car. Wow I feel productive
918 2018-03-15 21:57:25 In one tweet? .... Once upon a time, a seagull coated with oil believed it could never fly again, but survived, slowly slowly grew new feathers after the others fell, slowly learned to love growing feathers, and her spirit flew, and the body followed..
919 2018-03-15 21:57:16 When the USSR the Soviet Union collapse went into a lawless state, where those who were the bullies stole govt assets oil fields , threats and bully tactics , took 15 years before Russia established it self the Russian State
920 2018-03-15 21:56:53 I use shea moisture and regular coconut oil in mine! I don’t like anything else
921 2018-03-15 21:56:49 Have I mentioned my weasel oil pyramid scheme? I’m willing to let you in on the ground floor.

924 2018-03-15 21:56:19 A journalism professor once told us, “fewer barrels, less oil.” I still repeat that to myself sometimes during word choices.
925 2018-03-15 21:56:11 And that’s being kind.
926 2018-03-15 21:55:53 Snake oil salesman on steroids this guy!
927 2018-03-15 21:55:52 Daytona, off admiralty by Forte oil
928 2018-03-15 21:55:50 does coconut oil even really help your hair???? or does it help hair growth? i'm confused lmao. i've been using it for like a year plus but don't even know if it really helps like that 
929 2018-03-15 21:55:30 We know fact - that we have the oil and gas resources. News soon hopefully that it will flow in good quantities
930 2018-03-15 21:55:30 'i put essential oil on everything. its all over my salt lamp right now' GUESS WHO
931 2018-03-15 21:55:16 Not all convicts are stupid. Some have technical skills but poor life skills. Your average human, however, is pretty stupid. Most people can't even fix a flat tire or change the oil in their car.
932 2018-03-15 21:55:13 Mechanic’s do tell you shit you didn’t come in for  nigga I can in for an oil change
933 2018-03-15 21:55:10 Oil field?

935 2018-03-15 21:54:45 Right on my temples! If that doesn’t work for me I take some and press it t the roof of my mouth! I use Young Living oils and their peppermint oil is one that can be ingested! I haven’t taken medication for my migraines in 11 months!
936 2018-03-15 21:54:32 do you want to burn your nipples with hot oil. wear an apron
937 2018-03-15 21:54:00 Just live someplace not controlled by you liberals. In fact, anywhere except the top 10 US Dem cities is safer than SWI. Thinking gives you colon cramps, doesn't it?
938 2018-03-15 21:53:53 yeah Seth what happened to hydrogen fuel cells.. do you know we could had electric cars in the 1950's ? can you imagine how good they'd be now and how much cleaner our cities would be ? oil stole our future, but it's not too late to take it back!
939 2018-03-15 21:53:46 They sell it at all @Servilleshair’s and some Shampoo and Things. The staff will be able to help you with the best product - all Davines is good. They use the latest hair tech and it’s saved my hair bleaching arse! (I’d go with Oi and get the hair oil too for nourishment xxx)

941 2018-03-15 21:53:28 Dude, even a stuck clock is right twice a day. Kudlow is a supply-sider snake oil salesman and a shill for CNBC....
942 2018-03-15 21:53:27 United will go back to selling tickets like they did after they dragged a person off the flight in April of last year. 

Unless the media is invested in those companies. When was the last time they reported about Nestle using child labor? PepsiCo palm oil plantations slaves?
943 2018-03-15 21:53:25 #Balance your mind, body, and soul with #ChuanSpa's signature oil for the Spring season. Associated with healing and flexibility, this essential oil balances the senses with soothing lavender, calming chamomile, and hints of vetiver and sweet orange.
944 2018-03-15 21:53:18 Pro-pipeline WANT oil, they use it and, unlike opponents, they're not hypocrites. Watch out for those last few brain celss...
945 2018-03-15 21:52:57 The YOU are on the right trajectory.
946 2018-03-15 21:52:49 Mixing olive oil into my conditioner was the best thing I’ve done for my hair in awhile tbh
947 2018-03-15 21:52:42 Something tells me this is nothing more than his agent standing on the metaphorical corner selling snake oil.
948 2018-03-15 21:52:40 But have you recovered all the oil in that 400m space where there is the effect of reduced pressure? Or does the reduced pressure caused prevent you from recovering it?
949 2018-03-15 21:52:29 They use it to blow out oil well fires or something
950 2018-03-15 21:52:21 Think the oil company's should pay instead but it's also the governments fault too
951 2018-03-15 21:51:58 mix castor oil and aloe

956 2018-03-15 21:51:03 I used a new hair oil tonight and it’s made my hair greasy AF!! 
957 2018-03-15 21:51:01 They are not the international community they are in your club , lets see how far the EU backs you when they want their gas and oil from Russia ,
Trump wants to sell his gas / oil to the EU , why else is he selling arms now to Ukraine its called a PIPELINE  ring any bells
958 2018-03-15 21:50:57 This is what happens when you fry everything in oil as the hallmark of your cuisine. You get to lead the nation in obesity, inactivity, diabetes and arthritis.
959 2018-03-15 21:50:54 We dropped the prices of the some of the higher priced White Label Extracts down to $20 and $25 before tax! Come swoop up a great deal! #oil
960 2018-03-15 21:50:49 Just found out that @walmart PUT THE WRONG OIL IN MY CAR WHEN I GOT AN OIL CHANGE. Now I’m back having to pay more money for a new one.
961 2018-03-15 21:50:42 We need the full spectrum of enhanced sanctions recommended by Congress, for starters.  If the Russians try expelling our diplomats, we can work on lowering the price for oil and natural gas.
962 2018-03-15 21:50:40 Feels good to burn that midnight oil. Spending hours brainstorming on ideas. It's the life we chose.
963 2018-03-15 21:50:37 The safest place in the world? Wow this is a delusional take
964 2018-03-15 21:50:21 Sorry, not everybody buys your snake oil.

968 2018-03-15 21:49:41 @levinepmc Canada will soon be on life support.  Pipeline arteries going to east and west blocked and southern artery corroded.  Rails arteries clogged for mining, for oil, for grain. The pill for eastern Canada to feel no pain is massive debt. Everything is fine.
969 2018-03-15 21:49:35 The middle placard is actually true.

That's why criminals seek them.
970 2018-03-15 21:49:29 Lady, I come here to shitpost and trigger people like you. That's all. I'm not in it for followers. That's an illusion.

And I don't struggle. Ever. But, damn, if you didn't just prove yourself to be one fucking ugly authoritarian.


971 2018-03-15 21:49:28 Bio oil is really good !!
972 2018-03-15 21:49:20 But is he as diverse to where his shit with spray paint, acrylic paint, oil paint, pastels, markers, pen, colored pencil and paint markers look sharp. He got 2 years of age on Bonny to told u I’d be bias
973 2018-03-15 21:49:20 Roasted broccoli drizzled with oil and salt and pepper is one of my favouritest things. I will eat an entire large crown, easy-peasy. 
But I understand the pie envy.
974 2018-03-15 21:49:20 Definitely going to be interesting to see how it plays out here. Im curious how its going to work for job sites that require drug testing.. ie oil rigs, mines, construction sites, etc.
975 2018-03-15 21:49:18 Look at Wenger's School For Extraordinarily Gifted Frauds taking advantage of a bunch of oil painters and pastry chefs smh

982 2018-03-15 21:48:43 why tf this dead af oil meme coming back?
983 2018-03-15 21:48:37 not bad for a snake oil salesman though, cover of forbes and all
984 2018-03-15 21:48:37 I myself am doing the same, cod liver oil capsules and vitamin B12 made a dramatic change in my case personally

989 2018-03-15 21:47:50 Speaking to an empty chair; how is it to feel so vacuous?
990 2018-03-15 21:47:49 I'd add the "deficit" in goods w/ Canada also includes a bunch of unrefined oil which is refined here and exported elsewhere. The net of which isn't reflected in the "deficit" which looks at Canada alone
991 2018-03-15 21:47:44 Andrew try the tunisian-judeo style with fresh cumin powder, olive oil, lemon juice and seasoned with ground harissa.
992 2018-03-15 21:47:40 We’re not going to roll over to help your government get re-elected next year.  We aren’t going to risk our coast so an oil company from Texas can ship oil to China, either.
993 2018-03-15 21:47:34 The president of the United States demonstrates commitment to diversity by mixing Cream cheese and Chili oil
994 2018-03-15 21:47:30 They will never pass up an opportunity to compare President Trump to Hitler, or report on him in a negative way. 

It's beyond obvious, and I actually feel embarrassed for them.
995 2018-03-15 21:47:18 Worked so well that my Aussie friends have all moved here to escape the rampant violent crime rate from which there is no unalienable right of defense. Nice try...but no. US is safest place in world.
996 2018-03-15 21:47:10 Finally getting my oil anger after a year... yes I know I'm stupid but I had no idea I was suppose to do it every 3 months
997 2018-03-15 21:46:43 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
998 2018-03-15 21:46:25 Well the 1st one was about oil as my brother in law sas major told me as soon as he got sent to goose green. Other ones I think was because we are kuwaits best mate. Oh oh no oil again

1005 2018-03-15 21:45:19 That chart is a thing of beauty in that with a fair wind, decent oil/LNG price and good management we could get back some of the fall.  Not a thing of beauty if you purchased at £4 of course.  Think I bought first slug at £1.80 ish.
1006 2018-03-15 21:45:17 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1007 2018-03-15 21:45:11 Our gas imports from Russia apparently are as low as 1% so easily replaced. Oil I can't find a figure for but it looks a fair bit higher on the graph.

1010 2018-03-15 21:45:02 This man is a conman...a snake oil salesman
1011 2018-03-15 21:45:01 Having a car is cool until you get pressured into spending 130 fucking dollars on an oil change
1012 2018-03-15 21:44:53 Look, I agree that America & the UK went to war in Iraq to get their hands on all that oil, it also meant they could sanction Iran without losing access to oil. That makes sense. Saying the UK killed their own double agent so they could expel some diplomats makes no sense at all.
1013 2018-03-15 21:44:39 US criminals have invaded an independent and sovereign state, they did it for the umpteenth time, arm the worst murderous terrorists and steal oil, vital to a country destroyed by them.
1014 2018-03-15 21:44:28 Can you post a pic? Phil blocked me for mocking his slap down from @SebGorka  He’s very fragile
1015 2018-03-15 21:44:22 I've been offline, rubbing honey and coconut oil on my face, and it has been a joyful evening
1016 2018-03-15 21:44:06 So iraq did have weapons of mass destruction & it all wasn't about oil (contracting Alan Greenspan's claim)

The UK does pay fair levels of benefits contradicting what the UN says

The UK will be £350mln a week better off leaving the EU & it can go to the NHS

That kind of trust?
1017 2018-03-15 21:43:53 The more oil we burn, the more we screw the climate for future generations. Fossils were extremely useful to humans. Which makes it hard to wean from them. Like drugs/cigarettes I guess. We know we need to stop, but we’re addicted to positive effects. Blind to the negative.
1018 2018-03-15 21:43:40 Riiight

Thank Zinke for expensive plane flights on American’s tax dollars

Selling off our park lands to oil companies

Can we make him PERSONALLY responsible to pay us back?

1021 2018-03-15 21:42:58 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

1024 2018-03-15 21:42:44 They need to blend the heavy oil from Venezuela or Canada in their refineries or rebuild them. Venezuela can't afford distillates to produce anymore. What do you think they are going to do?

1029 2018-03-15 21:42:13 It is indeed the Judeo-Christian world that has fought against the Muslim nation! This has never stopped since the Crusades
The solution would be to cut off the flow of oil and abandon this currency, bringing all the dramas to our world!

From what I hear you might need to have an increase in the ppm of the cbd oil. 
But only you can judge the effects.
It breaks my heart our so called leaders have failed us again this year in Frankfort. They need replacements.

1053 2018-03-15 21:39:52 Nah there’s too much oil 
1054 2018-03-15 21:39:52 C'mon. They were given strict orders to seize the oil factory.

Technically they have oil and change it. So I'm not wrong.

1090 2018-03-15 21:34:32 Good for Canada if they follow through. More access to more markets means more wealth for Canadians.
Plus, if our oil can displace more carbon intensive sources like coal, its better for the climate.

1106 2018-03-15 21:32:12 Oooo, this is very interesting- and indeed lower than I believed. Although I assume that is still a substantial percentage. I think I'm also correct in thinking that Norway's supplies are running low while Russia is expanding production while trying to lay claim to artic oil.

Ditto with nuclear power, planes, kitchen knives, medication or baseball bats, it can be positive or bad.

1145 2018-03-15 21:25:14 Yep, they will continue to look for new oil and gas to sell and burn, in spite of the fact that we already have found more than we can ever burn if we want a stable climate, but they will change their name. That really is greenwash

1153 2018-03-15 21:23:36 Umm, false. The stats used were from the US government. And if the US didn't have access to our discounted heavy oil in a monopoly trading arrangement that THEY DEMANDED the price of gas in the US could easily be 10% higher. Nice of us to subsidize a neighbour.

I love the face that Garou has when he gets angry (that is, always hahaha).

This fanart is very close to how I paint with oil, I really like to see the thick brushstrokes. 
I have also thought about refining the brush...
1155 2018-03-15 21:23:11 Its crazy because lately when If I feel sad I also get a creative spark to work on something I enjoy and that feels good.

I've been into oil pastels lately just the feeling of it all makes me want to do so much at 1 time lol messy sometimes its like oh shit where do I even begin
1156 2018-03-15 21:23:09 DIA’s oil and gas wells not big moneymakers, audit finds
1157 2018-03-15 21:23:07 I have my tried and tested polish: boiled linseed oil, turpentine, and beeswax. Just like mother used to make.
1158 2018-03-15 21:22:59 And this is relevant for what reason?
1159 2018-03-15 21:22:53 Canada runs on Saudi oil. Now I say Allah Akbar when I pump gas, but I’d much rather say Oh Canada!
1160 2018-03-15 21:22:51 I look like a whole chocolate bar naked with oil on 
1161 2018-03-15 21:22:18 College kids and made freethrows go together like oil and water
1162 2018-03-15 21:22:17 What an incredibly gross thing to say
1163 2018-03-15 21:22:12 Mix sugar and either coconut oil or any soap and scrub the shit out of them lol thats what i do for my legs too after shaving
1164 2018-03-15 21:22:04 Oil has been shit from the start and this isn't a joke.
1165 2018-03-15 21:22:01 Oil change and a new air cabin filter.... oh so fun at the dealership
1166 2018-03-15 21:21:51 Left plate ones are overfried, or the oil was way too dirty to use. Right ones are ok
1167 2018-03-15 21:21:47 Dat tay are!
1168 2018-03-15 21:21:44 IM COMING THREW AFTER THIS OIL CHANGE
1169 2018-03-15 21:21:33 At least partner with @RachelNotley to close Alberta's coal-fired generating stations. Transferring federal subsidies from oil to building NatGas generation would pay for it.

For Darwin's sake, when are you finally going to do something concrete? Enough selfis & photo-ops.
1170 2018-03-15 21:21:25 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

Oando, total, mobil, forte, con oil are dubious.
1178 2018-03-15 21:20:31 Your comprehensive plan is a pipeline & fossil fuel expansion plan presented as a "climate change" plan. Your "hard cap" on oil sands emissions is a growth plan to raise emissions by 33 megatonnes. #cdnpoli
1179 2018-03-15 21:20:28 What should satisfy you? How @realDonaldTrump should punish @KremlinRussia_E? SWIFT cut off? Oil and gas embargo? Confiscation of Russian assets? Nuclear war? What is enough?
1180 2018-03-15 21:20:18 What about Thorium Nuclear? Wouldn't it be considered green? Solar takes too much energy to create and wind takes oil for materials. Thorium is currently a waste product and can burn other waste. Also is always on.

1191 2018-03-15 21:19:24 The girl who sits next to me at work asked excitedly what was in my amazon parcel today, so I placed each item on the desk: a can of WD40, a bottle of cod liver oil tablets and a pack of brown envelopes. I doubt she’ll bother ever asking again.
1192 2018-03-15 21:19:20 The best thing I did for my oily skin was use more oil, I liked the neal’S yard rosehip oil or the emma Hardie one, at e moment I’m using a caudalie one which is nice. What cleanser do you use?
1193 2018-03-15 21:19:05 Noteworthy. Makes me wonder if some of the red palm oil being sold here addresses this concern
1194 2018-03-15 21:18:56 Spending time on a sure thing,where are you hiding when oil is mentioned.
1195 2018-03-15 21:18:50 Bio oil has my heart
1196 2018-03-15 21:18:47 I got an Oil on Troubled Water, Polyamorous, Cloak of Invisibility and a Golden Egg.  *inhales deeply*
1197 2018-03-15 21:18:43 Can’t wait for their oil to run out and their primary source of income ceases. The Middle East is such a shithole.

1207 2018-03-15 21:17:43 tea tree oil > coconut oil and this is my opinion so don’t @ me.... thank you
1208 2018-03-15 21:17:39 Sometimes when your skin is super dry your skin will produce more oil. So, hydrating your skin prevents any excess oil to form. I have the same issue and found that when I moisturize more it helps keeps the oilness away. Hope this helps.
1209 2018-03-15 21:17:31  Left lemmings heads would spin! They’d rather have a despot in office and a corrupt Congress who’s now openly defying President Trump and Americans. They can’t hav us in the know and governing ourselves. We’ve been lied to, ignored, and betrayed.

1244 2018-03-15 21:13:14 I've read great things about the plant & it's oil. That said, it's not legal in NC nor did I know much about it back then. I also didn't have time to see if the oil would have had affects in the tumor I had due to the size, surface area, & wrapping around my optic nerve & artery

1248 2018-03-15 21:12:40 Why are you not fighting to get our oil and LNG to shoreline? We need to have money that is not borrowed.
1249 2018-03-15 21:12:36 Obama vetoed Keystone XL because my country prefers to keep its oil under its control. Yes, my country thinks your oil is actually ours. Because, it is. Murica!

1251 2018-03-15 21:12:32 You should check those groups again. They have had an agenda since their inception. What facts do you have that prove oil companies have bad intentions? That is a subjective comment. If they were only in it for the money, they would have dissolved long ago. Tiny profits.
1252 2018-03-15 21:12:21 Use sesame oil & tamari sauce & go heavy on the veggies

1256 2018-03-15 21:11:49 We've done something similar with Tripwire, vectra, Mcafee ATP and others. Would be great to share all this somewhere...Might even force vendors to provide evidenced and transparent coverage models of their own products. that would be a challenge for  snake oil sales  types

1262 2018-03-15 21:10:43 Ok tell me is it correct?
america steals all oil from KSA right?
1263 2018-03-15 21:10:34  the tariffs on the poor via energy were already there to pay for this garbage when US is now a net exporter of oil. In Scotland subsidies are being withdrawn. Meanwhile windmills are falling into the sea. If tariffs are your only objection then we’re on the same page. 
1264 2018-03-15 21:10:24 #allergyhour a local man got charged with manslaughter because he lied about using Peanut oil to a customer who had a peanut allergy and very tragically, caused her death. Surely, if gross negligence in this case leads to manslaughter charges - 1/2

1268 2018-03-15 21:10:02 Communication isn’t typically seen over 400m well to well. Gas oil Ratio increases as pressure decreases as gas liberates from the oil. Similar to shaking a Pepsi can then opening it. As pressure falls below bubble point GOR spikes, and starts liberating much faster.
1269 2018-03-15 21:09:48 It closed worldwide under 61.39. Any arrows or FE news? It's Friday tomorrow, so we know oil can act stupid.

1280 2018-03-15 21:08:23 Skin:
- Always use baby wipes they help keep it clean down there
- Exfoliate before you shave (but don't use sugar scrubs)
- Use Baby Oil to shave its better than shaving cream
- Buy mens razors they're cheaper and help you get a closer shave
1281 2018-03-15 21:08:22 So I take my car to the jiffy lube. I leave to get food while they’re changing my oil. I get a call shortly after I leave. No way they are done that quickly... they were in fact not done and were calling me cuz one of their guys had locked himself in my car and couldn’t get out.
1282 2018-03-15 21:08:19 If a person has the money to buy a barrel of oil or a carat of diamond what will the person do?
1283 2018-03-15 21:08:01 Gotta be oil or transmission fluid
1284 2018-03-15 21:07:44 see KSA is running out of oil. thats what happens when you rape mother earth. #truestory KSA has been buying up farmland like crazy in the USA west. They have oil customers and Israel will need that customer base to sell their oil too. All the while killing children #BDS

1293 2018-03-15 21:06:58 Taking things out of the ground leaves empty space  That  causes Earth  movement and  Quakes.  Along with the Health issues  It has to  Stop  these Oil tycoons making  billions are Old sadly Won't have to See The destruction they have caused. Future Generations  deserve better!
1294 2018-03-15 21:06:55 Too bad. It helps more Americans than it hurts oil companies.
1295 2018-03-15 21:06:53 I ordered my @Tesla model 3 march 31 st 2016. I sold my bmw 6 series a month ago. It turns out #TeslaMotors is behind on production so they pushed my estimated time from Jan-feb to April - June. Im driving 96 Civic that constantly leaks oil. Thinking about canceling my order.
1296 2018-03-15 21:06:48 Haha oil companies, your just going to have to suck it up.  But hopefully that tax break will help you ride it out...
1297 2018-03-15 21:06:41 Wait, what? How is buying things a loss anyhow. Do you have a trade deficit with McDonalds? A big part of what we buy from Canada is stuff like cheap crude oil: you'd rather we'd all paid more? You haven't thought this through: like, at all. And neither has the President.
1298 2018-03-15 21:06:23 maybe a little pepper & olive oil
1299 2018-03-15 21:06:23 Coconut milk, coconut water, coconut oil...
1300 2018-03-15 21:06:04 There is no better feeling than peppermint oil on the scalp
1301 2018-03-15 21:05:40 Personally I trade crude oil futures mainly and some little currencies bt Tim's free webinars helped me create a firm strategy keep grinding
1302 2018-03-15 21:05:39 I’m in a similar boat and although I’ve never found a cure, I’ve noticed that using products aimed at oily skin makes it SO much worse which is strange (I guess oil free products = skin producing more oil to compensate??)
1303 2018-03-15 21:05:33 Honoured to speak in Calgary at the Canadian Energy Executive Assoc @davidyyc @DannyHozack. An industry group who are making the planet a better place,helping reduce global emissions with cleaner LNG,refined oil,high Canadian standards.

1305 2018-03-15 21:05:16  boiling oil accident? 
1306 2018-03-15 21:05:15 Forget coconut oil I put Shea butter on my whole life 
1307 2018-03-15 21:05:03 Ex-politician Portillo conveniently avoids mention of Azerbaijan's appalling corruption & human rights record under the Aliyevs, but bigs up its oil trade on @BBC2 tonight, neglecting to ask or explain why the pipeline to Turkey doesn't take the shortest route through Armenia...
1308 2018-03-15 21:04:58 It's actually really bad! It seals the hoof wall and makes it so no moisture can get in. Hoof oil only for me
1309 2018-03-15 21:04:53 Rinse him with warm water to rinse away any product residue then gently rub in raw coconut oil where he's scratching.....yes he'll lick it off but coconut oil is very good for them anyway. It's very calming on the skin! If no improvement, off to the vet to investigate. 
1310 2018-03-15 21:04:47 I know someone with RA that swears by it . He uses the oil on painful inflamed joints and says it really helps .
1311 2018-03-15 21:04:40 Exxon & others have indicated recently that they’re increasing refined products & the lighter shale oil is not what they’re after. I guess the plan is to import the heavy & export the light
1312 2018-03-15 21:04:38 One more and you can get a group discount on your TDS meds
1313 2018-03-15 21:04:34 I mean she could be insinuating she'd use your bathroom, shit and not flush - that kind of bomb.

1317 2018-03-15 21:04:16 Don't forget, we need their oil and gas too. This is a ridiculous charade.
1318 2018-03-15 21:04:10 Give me a break. A barrel of oil isn’t even close to $100.00 and they are continuing to jam the people.  Did they ever think is gas prolines were lower, more people would drive, take trips, fly etc? Because things would be cheaper
1319 2018-03-15 21:04:07 Agree with you about the problems of decentralizing to the provinces Not to mention the authorities in Baghdad esp when oil prices are high try to keep all their power & increase their role
1320 2018-03-15 21:04:04 When the guy take $20 off ya oil change cause you cute and he like ya smile! I don’t even have makeup on and I’m in leggings wonder what discount I would’ve got on a good day lol

1324 2018-03-15 21:03:15 I think the service is great. It's just how some people use it, I guess. Lots of people just spam add everyone, regardless of what field they are in. I've had oil drilling people add me lol. The way it connects people by location etc is really smart tho.
1325 2018-03-15 21:03:02 I poured too much oil by accident, ugh. Gotta go back to cooking with very little or no oil.
1326 2018-03-15 21:03:00 Why would it be any other way.  People wake up hold these companies accountable  They caused the mess they must clean it up.  Wind Solar jobs jobs jobs in  All States. Oil and  Coal no more Time to go 100%clean  renewable energy
1327 2018-03-15 21:02:59 My boss yelled at Chris today bc he had a little puddle of oil by his machine but mine has oil everywhere and he asked me nicely to clean it up everyone hates Chris

1349 2018-03-15 21:00:33 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1350 2018-03-15 21:00:31 I don't take any supplements with beta carotene; only omega 3 fish oil, vitamin D, K2 and magnesium.

1352 2018-03-15 21:00:16 Would that he was anti-Alberta oil. But, no, he’s trying to sell the stuff to the detriment of most people except a few workers and some wealthy shareholders. The oil sands are killing us.
1353 2018-03-15 21:00:08 It's the cost of heating oil, surely.

1392 2018-03-15 20:55:59 Ah, the "alpha male" who is also pedo and mocks kids.
1393 2018-03-15 20:55:53 We make a mess of every country we say we are helping, are soldiers spill there blood for what? For the rich to have cheap help? Cheap workers, cheap oil. Do they care that refugees come here and rape our children? That it offends minority’s in this country, who turn against us?
1394 2018-03-15 20:55:43 This is misleading. Most of Canadas oil especially from alberta requires heavy dilution. The only way of dilution is light crude from overseas sources. Without that oil canada can NOT sell its oil nor refine what little it can. Even diluted still requires to sell at discount USA
1395 2018-03-15 20:55:39 USA deficit with Canada is misleading. Canada has no other choice than to sell its oil to the USA for being wether 1)refined or 2) shipped abroad. Canada has very limited refining capacity and almost no outlet to ship its oil abroad.
1396 2018-03-15 20:55:38 That has ZERO to do with my point. If you want to argue against their position, that's fine. But that's not what this guy did.

HE chose to make it about their looks. One wld think, if he had a better argument, he would have used it
1397 2018-03-15 20:55:35 um that's the kind of "FACT" you'd get from a tinfoil hat wearing internet conspiracy nut not something you'd expect the POTUS to say American cars fail on fuel consumption and emissions tests not every country does the car industry and big oil work hand in glove like in the USA
1398 2018-03-15 20:55:26 I am so ashame of myself! I really need to start checking my oil.
1399 2018-03-15 20:55:23 Transmission oil
1400 2018-03-15 20:55:20 Yup. No oil
1401 2018-03-15 20:55:15 US oil companies are extracting oil from the Alberta Oil Sands and paying the Canadian government less than $8 a barrel in royalties. Now that is government corruption and stealing.

1406 2018-03-15 20:54:31 I wanna be catered to. My back massaged with oil & my feet massaged  I really miss having a man for those things
1407 2018-03-15 20:54:28 Saddam Hussein was selling oil priced in euro, threats to USD hegemony are viewed as acts of war.
1408 2018-03-15 20:54:27 It's also should be a national security concern for Canada.  From my standpoint from the USA,   I hope both countries don't depend at all on oil from Islamic Majority Middle East nations.
1409 2018-03-15 20:54:25 Okay squarespace is super limited with the discounts I can do. So itll only let you get one Perfumed Dry Oil for $8.50...so tonight I’ll manually change them and they will stay $8.50 all weekend
1410 2018-03-15 20:54:24 Hair infinity and that wild oil w/e it’s called works 
1411 2018-03-15 20:54:09 The customer service @Walmart here in Lamar sucks. The workers are so incompetent it took the associate over 15 minutes to look up the cars info for the oil change 
1412 2018-03-15 20:54:08 One time I called the gyno to make an appointment. They had moved since the last visit and had a new number. I rattled off my needs. The voice on the other end of the phone informed me I had called Quickie Oil Change.
1413 2018-03-15 20:54:08 So I’ve been checking my transmission fluid and not my oil this whole time
1414 2018-03-15 20:54:07 An hour and twenty minutes.  I felt like that was a long time to wait for an $84 oil change

1419 2018-03-15 20:53:46 The real reason we can’t stand up to Russia is the same reason we roll out the red carpet to Saudi despots, our reliance on oil. Only through the formation of a green economy can we unshackle ourselves from these grossly unpleasant regimes.
1420 2018-03-15 20:53:42 Really?  Saudi no longer have the influence over oil prices they once had, hence the current price. The Saudis are reliant on the US and the West for their security. They won’t do anything to risk that. Russia has a similar GDP to Italy. Think about it.

1432 2018-03-15 20:51:28 I think her TDS meds need adjustment. The tolerant liberal is coming out.
1433 2018-03-15 20:51:24 Don't forget CIA n America's name destroyed Iran's democracy n 1953 b/c Iran was going to nationalize their own #oil 
1434 2018-03-15 20:51:12 A obfuscation piece that claims to "not know why they are protesting" - yet the message delivered seems pretty clear from here.  Bit of pro-gun nuts using rhetoric to shift the conversation from issue to messanger.  It's right out of the tobacco/oil lobby playbooks.
1435 2018-03-15 20:50:59 May get away with 3 one things for sure though it ain’t gonna shine like oil does & that’s a fact
1436 2018-03-15 20:50:58 If US were to place sanctions on #Iranian #oil on their own, as a reminder, the US has not bought any oil from Iran since 1991 #oott
1437 2018-03-15 20:50:56 where do i buy castor oil
1438 2018-03-15 20:50:53 Great plan, you turn off the oil & we can shut our ports , railways & roads that deliver goods through our oiless BC province. Let's see who caves first.
1439 2018-03-15 20:50:52 If you smoke pot I don't think you'd feel the effects off CBD oil though. I stopped smoking because it increases your heart rate when you smoke pot and I can't handle it anymore because if how much I focus on my heart rate
1440 2018-03-15 20:50:46 Just literally poured loads of olive oil in my baby’s hair that cradle cap shit is outttttt
1441 2018-03-15 20:50:46 As if the Earth's oceans have not been harmed by man enough Trump has unleashed Inky Zinke to pollute our coastlines by allowing exploration for gas and oil. The Gulf of Mexico will never be the same and he wants to endanger the rest of our coastlines? Crimes against humanity!!!
1442 2018-03-15 20:50:38 Who the hell thought coconut oil in a squeeze bottle was a good idea??
1443 2018-03-15 20:50:25 From our dm: "Hello sir, please I need your help and that of your TL. 
I have an assessment with an oil firm which involves presentation of  my last project work.. Is there any advice I could get? Secondly, my project work isn't related to oil and gas engineering, what can I do?
1444 2018-03-15 20:50:08 OMG! I would love to follow your advice! but E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G has palm oil in it!  They need to stop putting it in everything in the first place.  (But I'll do my best)
1445 2018-03-15 20:50:01 así son ustedes, creen que dan cátedra, jajaaj, no seas gallina intentá poner una palabra a una de tus soluciones: cepo. Indek. Roes. Retenciones. Ganancias. C5n. Baez. Oil. Lopez. Caballo Suarez...

1446 2018-03-15 20:49:51 I have come to the sad realization that listening to news is a great source of depression. Today I decided to watch the news and the things I heard from how Oil would lose relevance by 2040 because Nigeria's main customers are making cars that depend on Batteries. I was depressed
1447 2018-03-15 20:49:48 They make a great relationship with the government, and we didn’t bomb the oil.
1448 2018-03-15 20:49:41 Oil
1449 2018-03-15 20:49:41 @erbodylovetacos Oof! Did you get the oil changed yet?
1450 2018-03-15 20:49:33 Thank you!! 
1451 2018-03-15 20:49:25 Yeah with almond butter you just gotta break them down consistently until they release the sweet sweet oil
1452 2018-03-15 20:49:23 Everyone’s on cool spring break trips and I’m at Hibdon tires attempting to stack online coupons because oil changes are expensive.
1453 2018-03-15 20:48:58 Man, you’re attracting the wrong kind of attention. 
1454 2018-03-15 20:48:56 hey ava! they're defo veggie! however some veggie items that are cooked in the same oil mean they're not suitable for vegans! defo no meat is cooked in the same oil!
1455 2018-03-15 20:48:52 You should fix your Sidewinder issues before thinking of 2019 sleds.

1457 2018-03-15 20:48:32 isn't it just? I sometimes describe pain elsewhere as "toothache of the back" or wherever. It's that gnawing soreness. I really should get some clove oil. Perhaps I could find a whole clove? *goes looking*
1458 2018-03-15 20:48:27 14, 16 and 17 are all considered children where I’m from. What about where you’re from, are 16 year olds considered children?
1459 2018-03-15 20:48:25 Why does my face has more oil than Saudi Arabia’s oil refinery?
1460 2018-03-15 20:48:23 Potentially more aggressive sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, likely departure from the Iran deal (which Tillerson was lobbying to stay in)
1461 2018-03-15 20:48:21 the tunnel would be a good idea if this place wasn’t so close to the world biggest oil reserve. In #Venezuela..  my Birth place.... i might just drown in Oil .. there might not be a safe place after all .. our lives are in the hands of crazy a**holes
1462 2018-03-15 20:48:19 Cut demand and increase supply equal death of oil sands

1464 2018-03-15 20:48:09 A sign of the times indeed. Oil is a dirty word.
1465 2018-03-15 20:48:05 and they obviously didn't make their own signs.. those are professionally made.. question is, by whom?

1469 2018-03-15 20:47:38 Don’t keep up with affairs in the M.E then? He’s signed an historic deal with Saudi that allows him to control oil prices.
1470 2018-03-15 20:47:37 GABA is a great supplement for anxiety and poor sleep. Also lavender oil in a diffuser works well for me. I’ve heard taking a hot shower and then sleeping in cool air (feet outside covers) works too.
1471 2018-03-15 20:47:17 I also take CBD oil for panic attacks too if you happen to struggle with that as well. In less than a minute my panic attack subsides after taking a dose.

1478 2018-03-15 20:46:06 My oil defuser is broken ): rip
1479 2018-03-15 20:46:04 Same! I take CBD oil on nights when I just can't get my heart rate under control and that really helps me. I literally dread going to bed though unless I'm exhausted and know I'll fall asleep quickly. Cuddling your boyfriend helps too 
1480 2018-03-15 20:45:55 PLS HELP- my skin has always been oily (and obvs with so much acne) but over the past 6 months or so it has got SO bad to the point where I actually hate social situations because I know my skin is literally just covered in oil. Like I’m not just talking a bit dewy
1481 2018-03-15 20:45:51 Funny asshole, though.
1482 2018-03-15 20:45:38 An oil change this easy GAME OVER
1483 2018-03-15 20:45:35 Definitely going to try these, love the fact there’s no need for oil and that they are baked.

remember that was the last Government (Democrat) who starts to extract the oil and gas by 'fracking' process, at greate scale. So, this problem is inheritance of the Obama Administration. The 'fracking' is destroying and is going to destroy your country.

1526 2018-03-15 20:41:27 Louise Yamada just called for $55 oil on CNBC, and she’s usually right.
1527 2018-03-15 20:41:23 And that’s proportional to country size.
1528 2018-03-15 20:41:17 I think she is hitting on you.
1529 2018-03-15 20:41:16 When we keep a pig in the sty out the back, and grow cabbages in the garden, it's the future. The oil will run out, and there will be no grapes from India or green beans from Honduras.
1530 2018-03-15 20:41:16 Yeah I agree. Ensuring you get the essentials of a cardio-protective diet is also important. Olive oil, lots of green veg, unsalted nuts etc

Anti-crude oil pipeline movement gives crude-by-rail industry a free pass for greater GHG emissions, gives Saudi oil producers a free pass on anti-democracy and beheadings [and higher priced oil] & lies about pipeline risk assessment.
1534 2018-03-15 20:40:47 There will be a proliferation of stem cell clinics this decade. Many will be excellent. Snake oil is certainly too harsh for some of the others, but for the bottom end, maybe just ‘liars’. Short, unambiguous language.
1535 2018-03-15 20:40:37 An incidentally vegan dish for tea: spaghetti with good tomatoes, loads of fresh parsley, salt, pepper, and oil. So simple but totally delicious.

1541 2018-03-15 20:40:00 Why were the refineries not fixed by GEJ regime which you serve for a six good years when oil price was at all high. Is on re ord that no new refinery/petrochemical & LNG plants was built or turnaround maintenance carried out on the existing old ones. No FID for Brass LNG, Ok lng
1542 2018-03-15 20:39:58 Having an extra ass skincare routine is great until it's time to travel.... Is bringing a glass bottle of rosehip oil worth the hassle?

1551 2018-03-15 20:38:44 Oil is the answer to taking out Russia who gets most of its revenue from Oil and Gas. For you Game of Thrones fans, the bank wont save them if Oil is $40 a barrel. Same with Iran, Saudi Arabia etc. So dumb to criticize if you think Russia is a problem
1552 2018-03-15 20:38:38 i got my oil changed and cleaned the inside of my car and got it washed and vacuumed today. incredible

1563 2018-03-15 20:37:31 i’m getting my oil changed and this old lady that is sitting next to me got so excited because “the circus is coming to town! wow!” it was so cute the way she reacted 
1564 2018-03-15 20:37:21 i would like to contact her also, have any of you managed to find out or where we can buy that oil from?
1565 2018-03-15 20:37:19 Not just because of wrinkles, fear of oil stains, etc but also because of fears of ripping the crotch of the suit moving my legs around to get on the bike.
1566 2018-03-15 20:37:18 ITS NOT A DEMOCRACY UNLESS YOU LET US PRIVATIZE YOUR OIL
1567 2018-03-15 20:37:02 Until the day we are soaked in oil and used as torches to light a street like Nero did to the early Christ Followers, I am unmoved.  Paul said that those outside the church will be judged, and not by us.  We need to continue to love as Jesus did, no matter the assault.
1568 2018-03-15 20:36:55 Very interesting.  When it was Cape Town, that snake oil saleswoman dictated it was a provincial problem. Now, as

1569 2018-03-15 20:36:54 Totally agree with you - everybody should avoid products made with Palm Oil....Cadbury’s are one of the major culprits in the use of this product!
1570 2018-03-15 20:36:47 Anyone interested in the link to my Cannabis CBD oil online store?
1571 2018-03-15 20:36:47 Driving into valvoline and sitting in my car on twitter while the guys change my oil is super clutch.
1572 2018-03-15 20:36:46 reaching a scale where they might wanna physically separate service and sales into different stores. consolidate the good techs. you don't go to the car dealership and patiently wait for the salesman to finish changing the next guy's oil before he can take you on a test drive.
1573 2018-03-15 20:36:46 Went to get my oil changed, was wearing an @AuburnTigers hat. Guy behind the counter said Auburn was his dark horse in the tourney because Bruce coached at USI in Evansville years ago and he'd always cheer for him. Auburn's got some hoosier fans, baby

1582 2018-03-15 20:35:35 So nice that Iraq was rebuilt after we destroyed it based on WMD and 9/11 lies. So nice that our oil companies are in control. So let's destroy every other country that doesn't agree with us and the international banking cartel.
1583 2018-03-15 20:35:07 I hate to be that person who says “have you tried oils?” Hahaha buttttt here I go. Peppermint oil on my temples and neck really helps my headaches.

*In this case, I'm guessing "some people" are the ones who own the oil and gas wells in Oklahoma.

1625 2018-03-15 20:27:41 It's time to expose the hypocrisy of expanding offshore oil production and transport on the east coast of Canada while prohibiting any expansion even of shipping on the West Coast. 700,000 barrels of oil a day imported into Eastern Canada but  no pipeline from the West. Sad.

1666 2018-03-15 20:22:54 Trade includes both goods and services. The USA has a deficit in goods traded but the USA has a trade surplus in services. Overall the USA has a surplus in both goods and services traded with Canada. But, if Canada stops selling cheap oil and electricity to the USA, deficit gone!

1701 2018-03-15 20:19:10 Yes! But that’s a correct point rooted in national-income accounting identities & comparative advantage. I’m making a smaller statistical point: the difference btwn the two countries’ estimates is statistically insignificant. A tiny move in USDCAD or oil prices and it disappears.

1706 2018-03-15 20:18:27 Boise bad at his job. #NailedIt. #VictoriaWouldApprove #PunGameStrong #YouCantHandleTheTruth #Oil? #YouCookin?
1707 2018-03-15 20:18:23 In its first stages with just oil! The smell of the rice roasting is just so yummy. Garlic + butter smells delicious as well!
1708 2018-03-15 20:18:22 Dude... these people can't tell you what AR stands for, or even what bathroom to use.... I wouldn't worry about it too much.
1709 2018-03-15 20:18:00 Tissue oil changes the booty rub game.
1710 2018-03-15 20:17:57 waiting on this oil change
1711 2018-03-15 20:17:38 @tartecosmetics do I put in the maracuja oil first or the h2o serum? :) do they work well together? Is that serum limited edition??
1712 2018-03-15 20:17:35 I think she means “I will need a lawyer in the near future,” not future lawyer.
1713 2018-03-15 20:17:25 You smell like olive oil
1714 2018-03-15 20:17:19 ❧  Fromage Frose  ❧

Offer to an annoying person. Use sparingly.

● 3 crushed mousetails
● a bit of worm
● 2 minced ice plums
● a flagon of oil of vitriol
● a furious goese

Eat it or clean the cauldron with it.

Will be 4 or 5 uses.
1715 2018-03-15 20:17:12 That's transmission oil......
1716 2018-03-15 20:17:11 Write about how the entire Russian/Evil story and sanctions was concocted to force the Russian oil out of Europe to make way for US oil coming in. Greed is non-partisan.
1717 2018-03-15 20:16:55 I never cook spinach ,a handful on sandwich or steamed weeeee  bit through pasta with oil ,p armeasan and lemon my favz...or loaded salad

1720 2018-03-15 20:16:42 I drive to utah tomorrow... and I have not packed or gotten an oil change ooooooops
1721 2018-03-15 20:16:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1722 2018-03-15 20:16:26 Can I oil you up AND jack you off, please?
1723 2018-03-15 20:16:20 Sad to see what Venezuela is going through even having a vast amount of oil.
1724 2018-03-15 20:16:02 My God! Wato dai sai ansamo ya da za'a tofa wani abu akansu suma
1725 2018-03-15 20:15:45 It looks amazing! Like a curly fantastic oil slick rainbow. Kudos!
1726 2018-03-15 20:15:42 Kia taking 5yrs just to do an oil change
1727 2018-03-15 20:15:41 Yes, these are the same teenagers; too young to criticize but old enough to walk around with “fuck gun owners” signs.
1728 2018-03-15 20:15:29 Because if oil recovers enough, they'll be back regardless of the expanded assessment. Because it's not about the assessment.
1729 2018-03-15 20:15:17 Tax the shit out of oil companies. Lion's share of that money should go to businesses that are aiming to lower carbon output.
1730 2018-03-15 20:15:05 Friend of a volunteer gave us a beautiful squash a few weeks back - someone else on the allotment then offered Jerusalem Artichokes - makes a lovely soup - in restaurants you might get a dribble of truffle oil - were using fried sliced mushrooms and crispy bacon bits
1731 2018-03-15 20:14:51 It is Big Oil.
1732 2018-03-15 20:14:49 Figure out what state she’s in and report her to the Bar’s committee on character and fitness. There’s no way she should be certified as fit to sit for the bar without being questioned about this.
1733 2018-03-15 20:14:43 I'll accept that this is simply based on that observation as soon as I see you all saying the same thing about the conservative women out there that have gone out with pro-2A protest signs

1735 2018-03-15 20:14:35 The Last Post: Harviestoun Old Engine Oil (4.5%), Caledonian Strange Fellows Talisman, Arran Dark, Sambrook's Flat White Porter, Elgood's Warrior, Sharp's Doombar, Caledonian Deuchars IPA, GK Abbot Ale, Williams March of the Penguins, Snails Bank Rhubarb, Broadoak Moonshine
1736 2018-03-15 20:14:22 Yes, incorporating feedbacks makes the warming effects of 8.5 more likely. Also, coal intensive energy services demand is not the ONLY path to RCP 8.5. Plenty of oil and gas hydrocarbons to get there also.
1737 2018-03-15 20:14:14 Gotta add oil (5W-20) to put out the fire from all  the friction of that fast-turning wheel.
1738 2018-03-15 20:14:01 Mmm... Con el lomo que está tan cerca de estar entre tus manos, tu novio de la Oíl o  conmigo, no hay muchas opciones! 
1739 2018-03-15 20:14:00 Heat? I don't argue with that ,but the fact that an egg is a protein in nature that gets denatured  at temperatures of say about 55°C, but now Imagine that boiling KFC oil ibulala umuntu la oil
1740 2018-03-15 20:14:00 Lol yeah just bought a Prius the other day after my high school BMW broke down from oil in the engine a year ago. I have one of the financial writers in my milieu @RootofGoodBlog so it's encouraging to have a "community" help while I'm on the path.
1741 2018-03-15 20:13:49 So you agree to (1) diverting funds away from healthy honey & olive oil sectors (2) undermining SDG 3.5 (3) targeting youth with alco ads (4) granting 90% of funds to THREE countries (5) documented subsidy misuse (6) market consolidation (7) hiring of futile external advisors+++?
1742 2018-03-15 20:13:47 idk if that's transmission fluid, oil, or blood coming from those crushed cars.... but that bridge collapsing is why I hate being at red lights under over passes... smh... #FIU
1743 2018-03-15 20:13:32 
1744 2018-03-15 20:13:22 Oh bless your heart, and how do you suppose they enforce legislation?
1745 2018-03-15 20:13:19 Coconut oil
1746 2018-03-15 20:13:15 How do you propose to scrutinise companies on foreign soil? Since Saudi Arabia has lower emissions than Canada, you could be losing the argument. I would like to see Canada self-sufficient, not because of our oil or environment or economy but because it is a wise policy.
1747 2018-03-15 20:13:13 #MATD recognise value and potential when you see it. Petro Matad is in the middle of company making period. Consolidated nicely load up and hold tight.

1749 2018-03-15 20:13:10 we've been cooking with coconut oil more often #Mission4Nutrition
1750 2018-03-15 20:13:10 Naive comment, world demand for oil is increasing, they will just buy oil from countries with no standards. As well Canada's national  carbon plan will go down in flames, no pipeline Alberta pulls its support and joins Ontario and Sask. and refuse to implement carbon tax.
1751 2018-03-15 20:13:10 @Plot57b take a look a this plastic bags dead fox and a cormorant plus oil visible in photo .pulled from river Lea.
1752 2018-03-15 20:13:06 Please use my Experience at a Alberta Provincial Court as a case study,  Opiates are pump in low quantities  via the Heating and AC ducts in a Oil film Concoction here in ALberta, and most that display reactions to the SUbstance are LAbeled as AFDS or "anxiety" disorder..
1753 2018-03-15 20:13:00 To be a Porn Star, all you really need is a camera, a chick that's DESPERATE for money, and baby oil..
1754 2018-03-15 20:12:59 All industry should be subjected to the same upstream and downstream scrutiny. Including auto manufacturing, cement plants, steel mills etc. Why should any be exempt? Foreign oil is no different. Required carbon to produce and transport and will contribute emissions when used.
1755 2018-03-15 20:12:57 USDA: South Korea - Palm oil imports will continue increasing to
meet the demand of biodiesel as Korea increased the blend mandate to three percent from the previous biodiesel blend requirement of 2.5 percent beginning this year.
1756 2018-03-15 20:12:45 What about the benefits ? Does oil and gas get a credit ? Let’s say a week in Mexico during the brutal Canadian winter for 2 for $2500 incl flight ? Or a warm home ie no death by freezing at -40 in SK ??
1757 2018-03-15 20:12:34 Blame the slip on Indian ice or Russian oil yet?
1758 2018-03-15 20:12:12 Yes, but why doesn't Trump push for more solar, hydro, and wind, instead of dirty oil, or his "beautiful clean coal?"
1759 2018-03-15 20:11:44 Ikr. Most fat cat corporations (especially the oil industry) couldn't really care less about the environment and would just keep killing the Earth.

1761 2018-03-15 20:11:33 has anyone used castor oil for hair growth and does it work
1762 2018-03-15 20:11:24 Earth to Catherine, there is NO place for oil in clean growth. In fact that would be an oxymoron.
1763 2018-03-15 20:11:22 Hope you continue this series by looking at the Texas Railroad Commission and its cozy relationship with oil/gas producers in that state.
1764 2018-03-15 20:11:14 with extra olive oil
1765 2018-03-15 20:11:10 Just a bunch of oil between changes when it shows the wall and it still runs/drives as well as it does"
1766 2018-03-15 20:11:01 What exactly is the goal here? Let's say you completely remove soy oil, and the industry uses palm oil instead, the meat industry will still grow soy (or an alternative) to produce feed, and land clearance will still take place! The increase cost is always passed to consumers.
1767 2018-03-15 20:10:52 I keep burping my fish oil 
1768 2018-03-15 20:10:43 So when you look at underage girls you define them as "being on a trajectory for hotness" or not? Ay ay corporal or some shit.
1769 2018-03-15 20:10:35 Either change his food to a more omega 3 diet (salmond or lamb) or just add omega 3 oils to his food. Such as salmon oil.

1776 2018-03-15 20:10:05 #Soybeans closed higher. Corn & Wheat ended lower. Crude Oil, Dow futures & Dollar Index all higher. Metals, Livestock, #Cocoa lower today.
1777 2018-03-15 20:10:01 If ever you want to play That game it’s because the US imports oil and other resources, other than that there is a surplus
1778 2018-03-15 20:10:00 Does anyone have any good sites for Oil beetles (any species) in Sussex? Still never seen one, but I feel 2018 is the year! @SxBRC @graemelyons

1784 2018-03-15 20:08:51 that million dollar could have been used to bomb more "terrorist" in our oil fields
1785 2018-03-15 20:08:48 Josh ure a wee Gem.
1786 2018-03-15 20:08:39 The oil & gas industry actually spent a lot on concerns about damage to rigs & equipment because of cc & rising sea levels. It’s business.
1787 2018-03-15 20:08:25 What's ridiculous is to pretend there is no case to subject foreign oil to the same requirements as Canadian. If they stand up to the scrutiny they can show that and stand on their own. Exempting them is plain wrong. In fact all industries should pass the same scrutiny.
1788 2018-03-15 20:08:21 I appreciate the disclaimer and pointing me in the right direction!On the fence about transitioning out of Oil & Gas and into crypto but I am not sure how competitive these salaries are compared to O&G.Especially with the current timing of the market.Thanks again!
1789 2018-03-15 20:08:11 I so wanted to buy CBD oil for this purpose when I was in SD last Dec., but getting 420 product for a non-resident is a pain in SoCal (the "legal" places won't let me in and the grey market is unreliable) Should be better this time around. At least I got a good pillow out there
1790 2018-03-15 20:08:09 So Tommy Wilson, when did you turn against Humanity? When did you begin to support the displacement of Syrians, Iraqis, for the multinational globalist oil conglomerates?
1791 2018-03-15 20:08:07 Sitting in my car for my oil change .. starving and watching the KFC drive thru.
1792 2018-03-15 20:08:02 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1793 2018-03-15 20:07:59 You’ve never called a kid ugly?
1794 2018-03-15 20:07:26 this is interesting. I like to make my own butters for face and body and needed something else other than coconut oil. Good looking out!
1795 2018-03-15 20:07:23 Getting an oil change inspection sticker & air filer 
1796 2018-03-15 20:07:22 Takullah
1797 2018-03-15 20:07:22 So obsessed with coconut oil, it’s even on my eyelashes 
1798 2018-03-15 20:07:21 I’m no oil painting granted...but that hurts. You clearly are still bitter I left the office ;-)
1799 2018-03-15 20:07:21 Stirfry brown rice and veggies with a little walnut oil and chicken broth ALMOST the same
1800 2018-03-15 20:07:17 Mmmmm I do love me some ad hominem attacks about appearance, as if they have ever come off as intelligent
1801 2018-03-15 20:06:57 I mixed it with raw white shea butter avocado oil grape seed oil and jojoba oil. Or sometimes i just use slow Vera gel
1802 2018-03-15 20:06:57 Oh well it must be fab xx
1803 2018-03-15 20:06:53 Nice memorial for the students that died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Real class. NOT
1804 2018-03-15 20:06:49 I use peppermint oil. I put it on my temples, back of my next and behind my ears. It usually helps pretty quick. If you do this dilute the oil in preferably coconut oil but Vaseline works just as well!
1805 2018-03-15 20:06:44 Erm. Tommy Wilson is supporting genocide, displacement of Syrians, Iraqis, for his multinational corporate oil profits. A globalist genocidal marxist.
1806 2018-03-15 20:06:28 Services=money. They are recognized as part of the official trade deficit measurements. They pay us a shitload for services. We pay a shitload for oil
1807 2018-03-15 20:06:20 Fine, you're both wrong then. Are we done?
1808 2018-03-15 20:06:15 The Pres is on tape at a GOP  fundraiser where he admits that he lied to #JustinTrudeau.

1809 2018-03-15 20:06:14 Human foods are less price sensitive than animal feeds - if you increase the cost of oil the demand would continue to a greater price point than if you did for animal feed.
1810 2018-03-15 20:06:13 Why does The Liberal government punishment on Canadian Oil ? Who did they sell out to?
1811 2018-03-15 20:06:12 In order to counteract the essential oil craze and the people who burn them at work, I will now be burning motor oil in my office for the next month. 5W30 Quaker State. The good stuff. Smells great.
1812 2018-03-15 20:06:12 Water or if it’s oil based then paint thinner i use to make paint it ain’t that hard to get out
1813 2018-03-15 20:06:07 Never had a bad recipe from him.

And yeah, finishing in a cast iron skillet as hot as I can get it with butter and oil. I'm so ready.
1814 2018-03-15 20:06:06 Are you using it with a carrier oil or by itself
1815 2018-03-15 20:06:02 Glad I’m not Trading oil today! Dang that is a tight intraday range.

1820 2018-03-15 20:05:39 now let's get down to business and oil under $60
1821 2018-03-15 20:05:35 yes same, just discoloration in my face & uneven skin tones. i would recommend aveeno moisturizer, black soap, shea butter, vitamin e, & tea tree oil. those are my essentials
1822 2018-03-15 20:05:30 Norway sends them to Home. Glorious warm Middle Eastern home with the Oil that the globalists like you want.
1823 2018-03-15 20:05:21 I don't  sir. I pray you tell sir! I am really interested in knowing all about how you got an Oil Block. I would have followed you to learn more,  but I only follow those who follow back because I am nobody's fan
1824 2018-03-15 20:05:12 How to avoid her when she chats u up alot, reply with a single word,always claim busy,reply n read her messages only when she's offline, she'll be frustrated except if she's a witch.
1825 2018-03-15 20:05:07 I support oil exploration in the 1002 Area of ANWR, but do not support oil exploration and development in the Arctic Ocean. I support mining industry in Alaska, but am opposed to the Pebble Mine due to the threat it poses to Bristol Bay salmon. (2/2)
1826 2018-03-15 20:05:02 That's why, PMB should have collected MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. Not to paralyse OIL & GAS industry.
1827 2018-03-15 20:04:51 i hate gettin my oil changed, because something always gets fucked up.
1828 2018-03-15 20:04:39 The problem with trying to choke off supply is that other suppliers will take up the slack (especially with US shale oil). Cutting demand through higher fossil fuel prices is a more promising approach - again, exactly as BC has done.
1829 2018-03-15 20:04:37 Well, good luck with that. The Liberals are all too happy to see expanded offshore oil drilling on the East Coast as well as import of 700,000 barrels of oil a day from foreign countries into Eastern Canada... But Tidewater access for oil from western Canada... it's a write off
1830 2018-03-15 20:04:34 I can’t help but think this is all a derivative of Donald recently watching the Seinfeld where Kramer tests his oil tanker bladder system.
1831 2018-03-15 20:04:15 I just used coconut oil hand cream and now I’m starving
1832 2018-03-15 20:04:05 Hey, that’s hate talk...
1833 2018-03-15 20:04:02 Yeah coconut oil ain’t for everybody. But that jbco is the bomb ! & Olive oil to me .
1834 2018-03-15 20:03:59 The future of energy: environmentalism and oil
1835 2018-03-15 20:03:56 ***Attention*** Starting Today, Southampton Recycling Yard has been relocated!  The Recycling Cans are now located at 5 Retreat Road.  These cans are intended for Southampton Township Residents only.  Southampton Township is no longer accepting used motor oil.
1836 2018-03-15 20:03:55 orange oil fields
1837 2018-03-15 20:03:46 Haha, my old car would always have issues within the first month after an oil change... It was really annoying, so I upgraded.
1838 2018-03-15 20:03:46 Whoever at Ford decided to put the oil filter in the 03 f-150s where they did I hate you
1839 2018-03-15 20:03:45 Ok, why didn't you point out that all gun owners are not cowards and KKK owners? That is a logical statement that would have made a fine rebuttal, and I agree with you there. Instead, you pointed out something (their appearance) that was completely irrelevant to their message.
1840 2018-03-15 20:03:39 firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever
allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt.
1841 2018-03-15 20:03:35 Also, isn't the main economic value of growing soy still in the feed, rather than the oil? The paragraph after yours states, even though is quantitatively less oil than meal, "the economic value of feed is 57% and soy oil is 36%"
1842 2018-03-15 20:03:34 Erm...Does anybody know how I can get an oil block please?
1843 2018-03-15 20:03:26 Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
1844 2018-03-15 20:03:22 Olive oil somebody said “I had my first of 5 at 21 now is the time Merica” like huh lmaooo
1845 2018-03-15 20:03:18 Oil!!!!! SMH still our problem
1846 2018-03-15 20:03:17 I mean, I'm gay and I can see that they're ugly indeed. It's just a fact, nothing wrong in pointing out that.
1847 2018-03-15 20:03:07 No, soy oil is a very stable product for using in manufactured foods, as is palm oil. Animal fats, by comparison, require more decentralised, local production which doesn't fit our current economic model. As I said before, it's also more profitable to use non-animal products.
1848 2018-03-15 20:02:53 I'm just trying to get my oil changed and this dude won't leave me alone 
1849 2018-03-15 20:02:52 تسلمو ادارتنا  
1850 2018-03-15 20:02:50 Found out that I’m allergic to sun screen and it took me 23 years to find out Bc tanning oil is life
1851 2018-03-15 20:02:50 Job I'm on customer has supplied paints. He bought Dulux one coat oil gloss. That's not bad to use. Good rub down. Bang it on 
It's a pleasure oil
1852 2018-03-15 20:02:47 Once you Globalists have taken their oil, you can send them home. Only Norway doesn't need your globalist oil. Norway has its own North Sea oil, as does UK and Denmark.
1853 2018-03-15 20:02:46 pulled armed guards from NYC schools...wait oil he has to defend the new assault and violence stats next year...
1854 2018-03-15 20:02:46 They'll be burning the midnight oil at Trump headquarters.....the shredders will be humming and the delete button worn out......

1858 2018-03-15 20:01:52 Wrong question DrJoeAbah The right questn shld be y would 1 person hold an oil block. is it done in Norway, cos they have oil too. Maybe in the RSA.
1859 2018-03-15 20:01:51 Like oil into plastic? Metal into aeroplanes and guns? Plastic and metal into computers and phones! Quick get off Twitter! It's unnatural.
1860 2018-03-15 20:01:50 Lads Jesus, it looks 10x better if you wash it and oil it. Comes out looking fresh 
1861 2018-03-15 20:01:47 Its like audiophile snake oil but for hams (mind, I am a ham and a high end audio enthusiast, but I’m also educated in enineering) #hamradio
1862 2018-03-15 20:01:40 Big Money exerts power. Ask The NRA & Congress. Big Pharma, Big Oil, etc. Big Media keeps us distracted.
1863 2018-03-15 20:01:32 All of those "Look at what is in you food!" things are so ridiculous to me.
Yes, it may look disgusting and it may seem really bad for me, but that is not what it looks like when I eat it and it tastes great, so what the fuck do I care how much oil I "swallow" by eating it...
1864 2018-03-15 20:01:32 I use a steamer pot & wipe sesame oil in it before placing the dumplings in so they won't stick. My years of playing "Operation" prepared me for extracting delicate dumplings w/o losing the soup.
1865 2018-03-15 20:01:28 Struggling with this one personally. They help us with gas and oil when we have a mildly bad winter compared to theirs. Then we also know they wouldn’t put up with shit like some twat walking into a school and blowing seven bells of shite out of a loads of kids with a rifle.
1866 2018-03-15 20:01:24 Ayyyye!!! better be glad I didn’t oil it up
1867 2018-03-15 20:01:23 Good...hope they go bankrupt.  WE don't need to be piping Canadian Oil to Saudi Refinery in Texas.
1868 2018-03-15 20:01:21 Ok:Let's compare depth and the arms budget...you have to admit you guys are a bit exagerating no?And for what?Cold war is over,nothing to gain in the Middle East besides the oil...

1872 2018-03-15 20:01:06 I think an oil painting of a polar bear is in order.
1873 2018-03-15 20:00:58 Touché! China is the banker and controlling the purse strings. China is the ultimate powerhouse in all of this. Never forget they have 100 year leases on the Russian oil. They gave the broke Russians enough money to float them and optioned the oil to heat China.
1874 2018-03-15 20:00:58 Abundance of it around at the minute. Makes the most phenomenal garlic oil
1875 2018-03-15 20:00:50 Whichever way is causing sea level rising -or- what’s in the oil&gas industry’s annual reports to protect their offshore drilling assets.

1877 2018-03-15 20:00:38 I just mock @davidhogg111’s pencil thin arms, @JessicaValenti. They are a symbol of the no-lift soy generation of beta males.
1878 2018-03-15 20:00:33 Sounds like an average warmonger American President to me. Obama’s actions were the perfect opposite of his words! He spoke green while giving big oil everything! Spoke peace while dropping more bombs than any president in history. Trump is a typical president!
1879 2018-03-15 20:00:28 Well your right about one thing. You are no oil painting

1889 2018-03-15 19:59:09 Because I would have to do one oil change and add 5 liters of oil to make the trip 
1890 2018-03-15 19:59:01 True, Mangnolia Tissue oil
1891 2018-03-15 19:58:59 Thanks to the United States for keeping our oil landlocked for you own personal growth.
1892 2018-03-15 19:58:59 Then why hasn't that been suggested? What is being overlooked? Isn't using alternatives to soy oil a far easier demand than getting between people and their bacon cheeseburgers, which is likely to cause backlash?
1893 2018-03-15 19:58:54 When was your last oil change?
1894 2018-03-15 19:58:47 After you get the oil block by being friends with a thieving president, don't forget to write a book and praise God.
1895 2018-03-15 19:58:43 surely. i would then sell 5% of my widgetco by #ipo anf lef the americans and english fight over the scraps ;)

1897 2018-03-15 19:58:33 I’m in the Kelowna, BC airport and chatting with some oil rig worker white man. Talking movies, and I told him Donald Glover is playing Lando Calrissianin Solo, and he said, not kidding “oh yeah man, that’s so gangster. He KILLED it in Predator 2.”


1898 2018-03-15 19:58:21 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1899 2018-03-15 19:58:16 I’d say on the 1-feminist scale I’m currently bra burning.
1900 2018-03-15 19:58:09 Sir simply buy a block, pour oil on it..... and exercise FAITH 

1901 2018-03-15 19:57:58 Why are you evaluating whether teenagers give you a stiffy, freakass?
1902 2018-03-15 19:57:56 Keep pushing that line. It's sure to make people sympathetic to your cause.
1903 2018-03-15 19:57:54 sticks i found outside that i dipped in pure oil
1904 2018-03-15 19:57:49 That’s what beard soap and oil is for mate 
1905 2018-03-15 19:57:47 Should I break out the sun tan oil then 
1906 2018-03-15 19:57:31 Second isn’t plausible in this scenario
1907 2018-03-15 19:57:27 Interesting. Was just reading a study that said those leaving are young, poorly educated males with addiction/depression issues.
Camp life is very difficult. When u leave high school to work oil/gas, few options for the future.
1908 2018-03-15 19:57:27 Ok, let's discount the fact that I disagree with you politically and that these girls also disagree with you. You saw a picture of some high schoolers and you thought: "these people aren't attractive, I should go to Twitter and point out the fact that these teens aren't hot."
1909 2018-03-15 19:57:24 We don't get a lot of steel from China but due to the real reason we went to war in Afghanastan,drugs and cement (mountains and their minerals,NOT OIL),you will find cement type product the problem.
1910 2018-03-15 19:57:16 I wish we had drive thru oil changes in PA like they do here in NC  #soconvenient
1911 2018-03-15 19:57:11 And never mind we don't want clarifications 4rm Indians you oil your own machine and we are not bother about what you do or how your players are so get this straight ok 
1912 2018-03-15 19:57:08 May this be a reminder to all republicans, boasting about deregulation for quick industry profit leads to tragedies like this, like the Houston floods, oil spills; trump brags he’s the biggest deregulator, to me that means biggest killer for corporate profit
1913 2018-03-15 19:57:05 What do you suggest?
1914 2018-03-15 19:56:57 Also it's going to damage the fuck out of ur hair. I would invest in leave in conditioner or some sort of moisturizing after shower hair oil!
1915 2018-03-15 19:56:55 Amirite?
1916 2018-03-15 19:56:45 @hereandnow ive been making quick breads a lot lately — they take 30 minutes tops and pop em in the oven. Family favorite is mediterannean - olive oil, black olives, walnuts. Toasted with goat cheese ;)
1917 2018-03-15 19:56:44 What's more dangerous: an armed man with a tiny penis, or an armed man with a giant floppy horsecock?
1918 2018-03-15 19:56:38 One reason oil shouldn't count is because the vast majority of Canada's oil infrastructure is owned/operated by Americans. But past that it's a commodity; there's little value-add. You're importing a raw material and adding the value after it lands.
1919 2018-03-15 19:56:38 No fair.  I thought these were Cheetoh Jesus quotes and I have never heard him say that.   Now the other slimy offspring of dishonest snake oil peddlers and hypocritical evangelical hucksters who are the #GOP spout that shite any time they are about to be particularly odious.
1920 2018-03-15 19:56:33 It suddenly came to me why Italians are always flopping on the pitch!  They spend too much time stomping on olives to make oil and can't get that Italian commodity of their feet! Do they have  soap in Italy?
1921 2018-03-15 19:56:26 When enough money is at stake ANY politician or corporate officer is corruptible.

1930 2018-03-15 19:55:09 In Birmingham today, where I live. Chatting with my Kurdish hairdresser. He said it was all about oil and kurds feel betrayed for beating ISIS. Can't help but agree. Brexit taking up too much energy and focus.
1931 2018-03-15 19:55:05 If the oil price included a fair tax for environmental externalities, O&G would be gone in less than a decade.
1932 2018-03-15 19:55:04 This one was made by a fellow massage therapist and weed connesieur. It's just coconut oil and cannabis. So, if you eat it, super high. You can even put it in your coffee. Topically, the coconut oil is great for massage and your skin.

1935 2018-03-15 19:54:58 yea sometimes i wonder tho if we subsidize business too much. i def think we need to tax oil companies like wayyy more than we do now & am pro-carbon tax. the gas tax was rly bad for targeting residents & protecting large biz
1936 2018-03-15 19:54:56 Hooray for good old fashioned oil!
1937 2018-03-15 19:54:54 No, I'm saying that even if you ate the same value of meat but cut out veg oil consumption completely then the amount of soy going into meat production would decrease, quite significantly so, because the main economic value of growing soy is for oil (for humans).
1938 2018-03-15 19:54:43 You know who jumps in to defend ugly chicks? Yeah, you know.

1941 2018-03-15 19:53:57 Oh I thought canabis oil helps alleviate seizures.  I know, these discrepancies from state to state w/laws is mind boggling and needs to change.  We need uniformity. Some states have legalized it while others are still locking people up!  CRAZY
1942 2018-03-15 19:53:49 Dan's on the phone with tech support and he asked them where they're located and they said Vegas and he's talking about how great the marijuana laws are out there and how he makes his own oil and shit like DON’T TELL STRANGERS THAT U FUCKSTAIN

1949 2018-03-15 19:53:15 Oil based cleansers, for sure. There’s a blend from Trader Joe’s that I like. No struggle removing makeup & leaves you with soft skin. You can do a mini face steam afterwards with a hot washcloth over your face for 5 mins & then splash with cold water. It’s amazing.
1950 2018-03-15 19:53:02 NOx and coal use in cities indeed bad. Fuel efficient diesel cars and coal filters could change that. No one dies in Canada from oil and gas pollution. Yes, in other cities with lesser env standards.
1951 2018-03-15 19:52:51 For the same reason people this coconut oil will solve all their problems

1965 2018-03-15 19:51:27 He gets America. He gets the break up of NATO and the removal of American troops in the EU. He gets Poland back first then the rest. He gets oil billions, he gets to stay president, he gets all his frozen stolen cash from USA banks because its not safe in russia. Etc
1966 2018-03-15 19:51:22 goods.. hmm what might constitute these mythical "goods"?
could one of those be perchance ohh i dunno ... OIL?
And what is our trade ratios looking like with those countries?
why is it never brought up our addiction to oil is like our biggest red trade item?
1967 2018-03-15 19:51:09 Yes in the 2100s we will likely use less oil than today and oil will be $500/barrel. Of course behaviour and technology will change by then. But slowly, very slowly.
1968 2018-03-15 19:51:02 That was oil
1969 2018-03-15 19:50:56 @vinbarone BdB is a snake oil salesman & he’s using the Park Slope tragedy for more revenue cams. NYC recorded close to 500 traffic fatalities in1995. NYPD reduced fatalities to 245 by 2011, before BdB and scam cams. Cams would have prevented this?Disgraceful disingenuous BdB!
1970 2018-03-15 19:50:55 Hhmmm
1971 2018-03-15 19:50:53 I love home made chips, these were far from my best. I double cook them and the oil was too hot for the first cook. But they’ve all been eaten. :))
1972 2018-03-15 19:50:47 You're using a stock image for your Twitter profile.
1973 2018-03-15 19:50:38 The GTB journey started from opening a barber shop at Ikoyi.

I'm not exactly sure how it transitioned into a bank. Just like how fashion designing became an Oil block, is blurry.

Dr Joe can  however open a barbershop and tell us, if it will become a bank.
1974 2018-03-15 19:50:37 Any man who defends this asinine comment says a lot about their insecurities.
1975 2018-03-15 19:49:47 APES - - we won't be disposing of the oil the way it says in the lab #wrong #sowrong #sorry
1976 2018-03-15 19:49:46 I'm still trying to convince myself that it's oil... It's oil.
1977 2018-03-15 19:49:32 i heard castor oil helps with growing eyelashes and eyebrows.
1978 2018-03-15 19:49:32 Apologies to Missouri for having to host this disgusting snake oil salesman named Trump!

Looks that way.

1981 2018-03-15 19:48:55 Do you knw black pepper is insoluble in liquid water and its only ur uneducated rogue police who will plant these things. Those protestors have better understanding of how to disolve red chilli in oil base.
1982 2018-03-15 19:48:53 See who you should focus on ——> @elizafut, she should be soaked in anointing oil.
1983 2018-03-15 19:48:49 so many oil memes
1984 2018-03-15 19:48:49 does the steam from when you open up fresh popped popcorn count as an essential oil diffuser? asking for a friend
1985 2018-03-15 19:48:42 then you take the towel and get it hot again to put it back on your face for another 30 sec and wipe away all the oil from your face with the hot towel
1986 2018-03-15 19:48:20 I’m sorry I’m uneducated but what is bad about mineral oil idek what it is really
1987 2018-03-15 19:48:15 Must be Venezuela/Colombia border. It's not just socialism, it's that Ven revenues relied for decades on oil  income and did not diversify.
1988 2018-03-15 19:48:11 The well informed concerns of Senator Whitehouse are shared by me & my family & friends; but in NC wth TOO MANY REPBLCN oil-company-SERVANTS, who don't serve American people & land, we hav no hope of aiding a clean, safe, healthy environment for us & all being poisoned in it.
1989 2018-03-15 19:48:07 So basically you take castor oil and a carrier oil (grape seed oil, vitamin e oil, any oil that’s noncomedogenic/doesn’t clog up your pores) and you mix them together. Then you put a hot towel on your face for about 30 seconds and then rub the oil on your face for 2-4 min and
1990 2018-03-15 19:48:05 What type sir? Palm oil or ground nut?
1991 2018-03-15 19:48:00 this will never happen since a full cleanup from an oil spill is not even possible. one leak and they'd be shut down forever, and we're left having to live with the toxic mess for generations
1992 2018-03-15 19:47:54 I think it’s considered sexual harassment. At least if the situation were the other way around it would be
1993 2018-03-15 19:47:38 My mind is beyond my 48, as I am beginning to confuse the words “laundry” and “dishes” (among others) and the other day I told me cat I needed to “put the water on” when I was going to put a pan with oil on the stove.

1999 2018-03-15 19:46:58 IN the earlier stanzas the similes are based on wealth (oil wells) and value (gold mines)... the offence is in her 'walk' and her 'laugh' - her everyday manner.  Her confidence is too much for some.
2000 2018-03-15 19:46:54 Oh ya..Biden’s no stranger to quid pro quo...just follow the money and path his son blazed when “appointed” to the board of directors of the Ukrainian oil and natural gas company Burisma..think Ol’ Biden had nothing to do with that?

2010 2018-03-15 19:45:17 Hey Don b'y, maybe Nanny should use olive oil instead of crisco when she's able to cook chips for the poor crowd. Might do her a solid when she takes ill nect time,  like a pre emptive strike...
2011 2018-03-15 19:45:17 As Charles Tannock tweeted when talking about Christopher Meyer’s comment: “Very good point here. French & German initial reluctance (as do a lot of oil and gas business with Russia) to support @theresa_may vanished on seeing the classified evidence”
2012 2018-03-15 19:45:14 I need an oil change
2013 2018-03-15 19:45:13 Scheduled my Free oil change at Toyota dealership. Been here 2 hours now. How long will it take?
2014 2018-03-15 19:44:53 Everyone hates coconut oil but I still really like it. I think it does my hair and my skin really well. I used to use it to remove my eye makeup but when I switched over to almond oil I stopped putting it on my face completely.
2015 2018-03-15 19:44:47 The fact that it's not currently used is not a valid argument. Actually, plants are being built. There is life after oil and gas. Denial won't change reality. Fossil fuel era is coming to and end. This is good news.
2016 2018-03-15 19:44:46 Nobody's demanding using guns to take guns, legislation yes, guns nope.
2017 2018-03-15 19:44:41 Everyone’s skin is different but Renew by Melaleuca, Melaleuca/ tea tree oil, and vaseline work for me. (The first two work the best)
2018 2018-03-15 19:44:30 You can suggest whatever you like. And I'll suggest that you work on your ratio.
2019 2018-03-15 19:44:29 
2020 2018-03-15 19:44:26 I’m waiting for an oil change and this dude is blasting his phone laughing and talking to himself....

2031 2018-03-15 19:43:13 There was a ban on a specific weapon and it lasted 10 years. Not 'semiautomatic weapons'. Handguns are semi-automatic  too and have never been banned. You don't even know about the issue, but here you are, trying to defend a position ignoring the most simple facts.

2042 2018-03-15 19:42:14 That’s what I’m trying to bring to light. So much gets pushed under the rug due to the unexpected and dismissed facts. Oil is destroying us.
2043 2018-03-15 19:42:10 Sorry you so easily wasted your only argument about the absolute necessity of oil. That's the thing about scholars and liberals: we read before we tweet and we don't dare unless we know the answer. You should try.
2044 2018-03-15 19:41:12 Support foreign oil over Canada’s own oil.

2060 2018-03-15 19:39:25 INFO: After occupying Kurdish oil city Kerkuk, Iran's Ayatollahs & their Junior Iraqi puppet state decided to build a pipeline from Kerkuk to Iran. Now Jihadi terrorists resurgence ruined their dirty project.

2068 2018-03-15 19:38:51 I have never before in my life looked at like... a 13 year old girl and said she either IS hot or "is going to be hot" which what the fuck? because... wait for the logical consistency... I, unlike you, am not a kiddie diddler.

2070 2018-03-15 19:38:35 Vegetable oil
2071 2018-03-15 19:38:33 My point is, we need to focus on those we  choose to man our states cos' whether you like it or not, the quality of who we put there determines the quality of the economy of the state. Let's leave this obsession with oil money abeg. Its abt thinking beyond fed allocation guy.
2072 2018-03-15 19:38:32 Oil may not benefit all our states but at least let the state have full autonomy for the development and mgt of their mineral resources. Then responsibility will necessitate  them to be creative with whatever nature has endowed them with. The current system only breeds excuses

2076 2018-03-15 19:38:10 What? Where have you been? Literally 'kids' demand ban of semi-automatic weapons and Democrats introduced a proposal to ban all semi-automatic weapons. Including handguns. This is less about school safety and more about gun ban and gun confiscation.
2077 2018-03-15 19:38:08 Yeah like for some reason when I start using certain scrubs and toners on a daily basis I break out. So I’m looking for a more nature route. I’ll def look into flax seed and coconut oil tho

2081 2018-03-15 19:37:33 I put way too much coconut oil in my hair this morning. You'd think I just got off set from a casting couch. Not the case unfortunately.
2082 2018-03-15 19:37:32 The price oil will decide Americans economy, further jump at the gas pump would start a downward trend like 2008, It is the gas prices & tax
2083 2018-03-15 19:37:32 Russia also has extensive oil reserves, near to that of UAE and above Libya. Considering all the issue Gaddafi gave us over the years, Tony Blair shook his hand, smiled and paid for his oil.

2086 2018-03-15 19:37:24 Yes that is great for electricity. Who uses oil for electricity? A few islands. That’s it. I am talking about transportation & materials a growing, soon 10B people need. Yes I’d prefer pixie dust driven car for $12,000, too. Energy density matters, & while improving insufficient

2093 2018-03-15 19:36:42 Governor @elrufai has chosen to get creative about boosting the economy of his state and clearly, he isn't doing it with oil. I doubt I need to reel out some of what he's been up to for you... Well, except u want me to.

2097 2018-03-15 19:36:07 @realDonaldTrump Drop the price of oil.......
2098 2018-03-15 19:36:02 Like how do you not realize or care that your car needs oil?!

2100 2018-03-15 19:35:40 Gave Mom her massage with the thc oil again. She's happy!
2101 2018-03-15 19:35:38 That's true....

Guess the question is.. does he now go back to work for the oil companies and profit off the Russian deals he made or not.
2102 2018-03-15 19:35:35 Yes! I used to use it everyday but the bristles can be a bit much for me bc my skin is a little sensitive sometimes but spinbrushes make a difference. At least for me. Sometimes even regular olive oil is great for removing makeup. Better than coconut oil. Which is comedogenic
2103 2018-03-15 19:35:31 Simply, I didn't say that.

If you want to reduce soy production it's important to cut soy oil from your diet too - the oil is worth 36% of the value of the crop, so eliminating the value of oil would make the meal cost 63% more as animal feed - an increase that few could afford
2104 2018-03-15 19:35:29 Omg I’m in the drive thru and hear a car that needs oil and thought it was me. I almost lost it
2105 2018-03-15 19:35:05 Thank god for @Groupon just saved me twenty six bucks on a oil change.
2106 2018-03-15 19:35:01 I don’t know. As long as oil is pegged to then US dollar and we are the world reserve currency I don’t see an end in sight to our currency’s dominance.  It is a unique advantage we have.... for now.

2129 2018-03-15 19:32:52 First, as you point out, you can't just cherry-pick whole categories of goods until you get the balance you want.

Second, of course USTR's numbers include timber and oil. "Mineral fuels" was Canada's second largest export good category in 2016, for example.

2132 2018-03-15 19:32:44 Our multi award winning night oil!! You have it already! 
2133 2018-03-15 19:32:41 
2134 2018-03-15 19:32:38 I repeat:The reason the US has a trade surplus is because we are forced to sell our oil to the USA for fraction of its true price BECAUSE YOUR PARTY WON’T LET US HAVE ACCESS TO WORLD MARKETS!
  Yet we pay full price for our current buddy’s oil (RUSSIA). UK “we’re with you”. Kinda

2136 2018-03-15 19:32:21 Okay. Have you tried oil based cleansers? Like flax seed oil cleansers? They're good with removing makeup. I like the Garnier Micellar for the hard to remove makeup and I tone with witch's hazel.
2137 2018-03-15 19:32:18 Interesting article...but how can we expect the US to take our export seriously when our government doesn't to begin with (talking about industries like steel, asbestos, oil etc.
2138 2018-03-15 19:32:11 Distracted fluffbrain me accidentally smashed a bottle of perfume last night, so I hope visitors are OK with my room smelling like "Pink Pepper, Neroli Oil, Rum Absolute, Tobacco Leaf Absolute, Vanilla Bean, Styrax Resin" and so on
2139 2018-03-15 19:32:05 Also, the sentence you posted is followed by: "So while feed constitutes 75% and oil 19% of the volume of crushed soy (the remainder being byproducts such as soy hulls or waste), the economic value of feed is 57% and soy oil is 36%." Isn't that important?
2140 2018-03-15 19:31:59 Oil fluid
2141 2018-03-15 19:31:52 Are you kidding? Clearly the FED is obsessed with derailing oil, and the State Department as well: a few side casualties and control of the market as well...

2143 2018-03-15 19:31:49 Pple on roads knw how to create more effective form of pepper containing liquid substance. If its protestors they will sure not mix black pepper with water, since red chilli available freely on the market and ppl knws instead of water its either cologne or oil is more effective
2144 2018-03-15 19:31:42 Great project, one of the best ICOs. I have been in the energy sector(oil) for a long time and Robotina is really revolutionary and ahead of it's time.
2145 2018-03-15 19:31:40 Watching blood and oil season 1, wondering how did I miss this series

2152 2018-03-15 19:31:13 Walk your cute self to Juice Press (drive bc it’s LA?) and get the Ginger Fireball. Buy 2 of them. Drink one today & one tomorrow. LOTS of emergenC, elderberry extract, and oil of oregano. Lots of lemon & ginger tea. DayQuil.
2153 2018-03-15 19:31:13 Does that exclude natural gas shipments from Marcellus Shale to eastern Canada which are rather large? And oil is largely processed in Texas and some is re-exported to Asia. Yes, it's complicated.
2154 2018-03-15 19:31:13 Assume for instance that the tide swings, following your leading that the centre controls less, where do you presume oil as a resource will fall? Will it benefit ALL our states? Non-oil producing states shd do what therefore? Thats the thinking outside the box i'm referring to.

2158 2018-03-15 19:30:50 Almost everyone has dehydrated skins (skin is the largest organ and one of the last to get H2O) when skin is dehydrated Oil will not get through
2159 2018-03-15 19:30:49 Physically, I'm at work. Mentally, I'm on a private beach somewhere getting tanning oil rubbed on my buttcheeks.
2160 2018-03-15 19:30:43 They also are not he leaders of energy anymore. Oil is being drilled overseas now. He doesn’t want cheap power, they already have that. He wants nuclear warfare. No one wants anyone to have that. If there was a way to completely disarm the world from nukes, I would support that.
2161 2018-03-15 19:30:42 As the world converts out of oil, only the cheapest sources will survive. Meaning NOT Canadian oil. Time to dawn to this simple fact.
2162 2018-03-15 19:30:30 what’s oil cleansing?

Uhm....
2165 2018-03-15 19:29:54 But can you differentiate between synthetic and mineral oil? 
2166 2018-03-15 19:29:51 my $25 oil change turned in to $350 quickkkk
2167 2018-03-15 19:29:48 I usually shove a bunch of tar and oil  in my mouth before going to the dentist so when they clean me all up I feel like one of those rescued dogs. #treatyourself
2168 2018-03-15 19:29:25 No it's not at all....  I'm an engineer and have a great career... my education was normal and I'm still very creative, oil paint acrylics any thing creative without all the drama.
2169 2018-03-15 19:29:22 let’s just say I have a gallon of olive oil, a bitch of a fish but morals.
2170 2018-03-15 19:29:20 Do you need work done on your vehicle? Well come on in and see us. Here  at Second Chance Automotive we are here for your automotive needs. From  your everyday tire rotation, oil change and check engine light needs to  the air filter, fuel pump, or starter, etc.
2171 2018-03-15 19:29:20 Emmm have you got a hidden camera in my kitchen correct except for the olive oil bit. They went straight into the dinner! I only burnt 2 fingers in the process & possible a bit of hair 
2172 2018-03-15 19:29:13 Shale oil is usually lumped together.  I've read Bakken ~API45.  Permian (I assume BoneSpring/Wolfcamp) avg high 30s API.  Don't know Eagleford.  Surely it varies.  As we move from the high prod areas (which I bet are lighter/gassier), if avg API will lower appreciably?
2173 2018-03-15 19:29:12 One packet got me through last weekend (I use the oil all over post-shower.)
2174 2018-03-15 19:29:11 The first word of the round is "vetiver." Not to be confused with "vetivert," it's an aromatic grass whose especially fragrant roots yield an oil used in perfumery and are also made into mats in tropical India.
2175 2018-03-15 19:29:11 WTI Crude Oil+0.4% at 61.18 bbl $USO
Gold -0.6% to 1317.70 oz  $GLD
Copper -1.0% to 3.13 lb  $CU
2176 2018-03-15 19:29:04 It has been tried in Venezuela. In your lifetime by Corbyns friends, like besties Chavez and Maduro. They hold the largest oil reserves in the world their people are starving, eating pets and zoo animals due to 20,000% inflation.
2177 2018-03-15 19:29:02 Drilling for oil is boring.
2178 2018-03-15 19:28:57 This clown says he wants to ban “every weapon that can fire 150 rounds in 7, 8 minutes”. That would be the vast majority of handguns and rifles in the country. He’s a snake oil salesman.
2179 2018-03-15 19:28:57 Protesting in the adult sphere that affects them directly now means it's above board to talk/tease about the sexual attractiveness of underage girls with regards to whether or not their POV matters. Good new GOP platform

2181 2018-03-15 19:28:48 Japan one of the key countries in OECD. Strange that in 2017 they had growth in comm. oil stocks
2182 2018-03-15 19:28:44 My friend got me an essential oil diffuser earlier this week and now my room smells like an actual spa I love it

2184 2018-03-15 19:28:32 Well, I tried keeping the skins on and  heating the oil well before adding the sweet potatoes. They cooked well enough, but the skins just peeled off as they cooked (I hadn't expected that!) So I changed plans and places them straight on the rack for the last 10 mins. 1/
2185 2018-03-15 19:28:30 I didn't read the 'i just don't want to get shot' in the signs either.

2187 2018-03-15 19:28:17 Mr @McFaul what you think should we wait for grand sanctions and freezing of accounts russian oligarhs? broken oil's agreement with Europe? Sorry for my english ^-)
2188 2018-03-15 19:28:10 yo ive been using this olive oil infused shampoo and conditioner for like 2 months now and???? it works so well??? i also wemt back to taking iron pills bc its low in my body and after i stopped the last time idk ot felt like my hair was thinning but now???? wow
2189 2018-03-15 19:28:03 I know, I know, I know. There are different ways to account for the 2% discrepancy in who-has-the-surplus. But the idea that someone is cheating by keeping wood and oil out of the equation comes straight from outer space
2190 2018-03-15 19:27:50 No oil in Finland. We have to settle with beer and vodka.
2191 2018-03-15 19:27:29 Amazing.... a wall of sins! Sugary Coke, smokes, beers, oil and smokeless tobacco! The roaring 60s! 
2192 2018-03-15 19:27:15 Oil primarily has remained the major source of income for the nation = Fed Allocation. As a nation,we refused to move beyond oil,of course until recently when we decided to re-explore agriculture.Wisdom demands that a state serious about its IGR will think beyond Fed Allocation.
2193 2018-03-15 19:27:05 how can anyone think an oil rig is part of a natl park's vision plan? vision plans should be about protection of park and it's habitat, no public hunting, and expanding beauty and importance of OUR parks.
2194 2018-03-15 19:26:50 Looks like a oil painting awesome 
2195 2018-03-15 19:26:33 Humanity is coming to an end.We the People are destroying our environment killing marine life,animals on the verge of extinction,cutting forests in the name of development,coal and oil mines creating smog  giving lung diseases to people .

2198 2018-03-15 19:26:19 Are there any millennials that really do like truffle oil or are we all just trying to be boujee?
2199 2018-03-15 19:26:15 It looks like everyone is waiting for oil to unwind its record net long position and #wti to crash down to $55 before getting back in the band wagon
2200 2018-03-15 19:25:57 I think because when Russia goes on one of its aggressive military adventures, it's to preserve its own security, or something. When anyone else does it it's about oil, or something.
2201 2018-03-15 19:25:55 yesterday I kept telling myself I have to check my oil and last night I had a dream that I checked my oil  hopefully it’s as good as it was in my dream LOL
2202 2018-03-15 19:25:54 Isn't it funny how my tweet got a better ratio than yours, on your own TL, even after you put me on blast?
2203 2018-03-15 19:25:53 You know what, you might as well go to the gas station and pick up some Monsters, because I wanna be wired if you're gonna FUCK ME!

While you're there get some oil to, because I wanna know my asshole will be smooth sailing after all you all are trying TO FUCK ME!
2204 2018-03-15 19:25:38 @Kennyatkinson1 @simonrim any ideas on how I can make a nice aioli but one thats not going to give me a heart attack? I've got @HellmannsUK extra light mayo... garlic puree... what else do I need? The shop bought stuff is like drinking oil!
2205 2018-03-15 19:25:36 rocky: take my card and go get gas and your oil changed. 
me: first of all, i have anxiety and cry when i have to talk to people.
2206 2018-03-15 19:25:33 Trying to be an adult and get my car insurance lowered while I’m getting my oil changed #productivebish
2207 2018-03-15 19:25:30 I hate that I can’t go to the store without these nasty ass oil works saying shit to me.
2208 2018-03-15 19:25:20 A lot of artists also do "original" oil repaintings, where that singular repainting will be the only one in existence. Bet you could do some brisk business with those.
2209 2018-03-15 19:25:19 Shrug. Make sure to practice safe ammosex and unload it first.
2210 2018-03-15 19:25:18 i hate getting oil changes by myself and just sitting here for hours
2211 2018-03-15 19:25:12 I need an oil change quick. Any recommendations? My mechanic usually charges me $60 - $70
2212 2018-03-15 19:25:03 mugwort is such a great plant. mugwort oil is lovely too. one of my favorite. but smoking it is my occasional vice.
2213 2018-03-15 19:24:57 Caster oil, olive oil and coconut oil mixed.
2214 2018-03-15 19:24:54 I know it sounds greedy and enterprising but I wish we could just take over Syria.  It would give us a legit U.S. territory right by our allies: Jordan, Turkey and Israel.  Syrians could remain in their country and not have to leave and would give us super supply of oil.
2215 2018-03-15 19:24:51 I will be liberally applying oil to my torso all day, in tribute
2216 2018-03-15 19:24:35 Awefully fucking smart gals though.

2221 2018-03-15 19:23:49 Oil Money
2222 2018-03-15 19:23:49 I'm a firm believer in precision of language. If it's snake oil, let's not beat around the bush and pretend that it's anything else. Look at the entire "alternative medicine" arena -calling it 'medicine' is totally deceptive on its face, and that's a feature, not a bug.
2223 2018-03-15 19:23:46 Uh... OIL
2224 2018-03-15 19:23:18 Tryna have a blazing fire. But don't have no pitch oil. Yet.
So for now I just hadda feed the flame enough that it doesn't go out.
But the day I get dah pitch oil. That glorious day.
ALL dah pitch oil goin STRAIGHT in dah fire.
2225 2018-03-15 19:23:12 Well the NRA kkk and fuck guns signs,  certainly are more about repealing second amendment and violating civil rights than 'not wanting to get shot'

2229 2018-03-15 19:22:29 1. This is confusing, oil build during stocking season has been rather flat, surely this is a big signal that the oil market is tight and not much downside from current brent price of $65

2233 2018-03-15 19:21:57 I can imagine you roasting your own peppers, putting them in a plastic bag, picking off the black bits, and preserving them in olive oil you brought back from France.
2234 2018-03-15 19:21:52 Oiling up my entire body in coconut oil is one of my favorite things
2235 2018-03-15 19:21:36 Yep, that was a digital piece. I do paint in oil when I can, but I'm not yet fast enough with it to hit deadlines. I've often wondered how people feel about repainting a digital piece in oil. I'd love to revisit some of those early pieces now. Thoughts?
2236 2018-03-15 19:21:34 Reported and blocked! Pig
2237 2018-03-15 19:21:33 Quite frankly, I don't care how much you get for your oil. The sooner you convert out of oil, the sooner you won't suffer from that discrepancy. Heck, with Cheeto as president what prevents the USA from imposing a tariff once you build another pipeline? Wake up.

2240 2018-03-15 19:21:19 I dated a girl that was in an engineering program.  She would complain about one professor that would refuse to give partial credit.  He would say "Partial credit mean bridge falls down and people die"  She saw that as unfair since all the other profs gave partial credit.

2248 2018-03-15 19:20:26 Well it's not going through his backyard is it so who cares what he thinks he's just a talking head the basically works for the oil companies what do you expect he's going to say he has no heart or brain but he probably has lots of Lobby money from the oil companies
2249 2018-03-15 19:20:25 Try putting about 4 drops of Tea tree oil in a mixing bowl or little bottle and add a carrier oil i.e grapeseed oil/olive oil/Avocado oil then massage on your scalp
2250 2018-03-15 19:20:21 the best ways guys is 4 caps mct oil. 75 grams of grassfed unsalted butter, fresh coffee and blitz it together becomes a butter latte....its the bomb! :)

2257 2018-03-15 19:19:04 We watch as the planet is destroyed & humanity gets more violent & depressed & yes we are trapped in these systems as well, dependant on oil & food shipped from high cancer centers all over the world. We were born into it as well but r all working towards changing that.

2265 2018-03-15 19:18:08 Man those small places will change your oil but then grab a hammer and smack the shit out of random stuff under your car. I swear.
2266 2018-03-15 19:17:50 Where’s a good place to go for an oil change? I usually go to the Acura dealership but don’t nobody feel like going all the way west Ashley
2267 2018-03-15 19:17:30 He doesn’t have an excuse to comment on their looks. How is him being mad an excuse for commenting on how sexually pleasing he finds them? 
2268 2018-03-15 19:17:27 Someone on the Facebook stream of the news conference suggested he looks like the guy who's updating you on the work they've done on your car (oil change, tire rotation, serpentine belt...).
2269 2018-03-15 19:17:24 I'm sorry you're so used to people having vocal opinions being paid by the Koch Brothers, big oil, big pharma, etc that you can't grasp the concept of someone having a genuine opinion.
2270 2018-03-15 19:17:14 ah, i don’t see why not then! look into rosehip oil! my skin is really try and that helps a ton
2271 2018-03-15 19:17:10 The town is't not in Nija.Are they only Nigerians that supposed to benefit from the oil getting within their towns or villages.
2272 2018-03-15 19:16:35 Any Democrat who did a fraction of what Trump and his crew has done in office thus far would have been boiled in oil a long time ago! There are double standards for Republicans and Democrats, “ is that right!? “
2273 2018-03-15 19:16:23 Too bad 500% increase in oil tanker traffic will probably doom them.
2274 2018-03-15 19:16:23 Crude Oil prints fresh session high at 61.53. #forex #CRUDEOIL
2275 2018-03-15 19:16:12 I think so but my lobes are dry and I don’t have E oil at the moment
2276 2018-03-15 19:16:06 My point is i dont think any more will be coming out (sending russia a sample is a red herring)- so we do nothing, or make a measured response in my opinion. I think putin is playing us for political gain though, he knows we can do nothing, and that europe relies on russian oil.
2277 2018-03-15 19:15:47 Us needs Syria to fall because of Assad and his attitude toward the oil pipes etc, Russia is backing up the Syrian government against the terrorists for a good reason ie (Libya iraq) the EU or Nato is orchestrated to lean towards us interests
2278 2018-03-15 19:15:43 The part where you excuse him and say “I don’t think any overly sexual point was made in his tweet at all”. That’s you saying you don’t think he meant their sexual attractiveness to him.
2279 2018-03-15 19:15:28 PSA: @beautycounterhq eye makeup remover is AMAZING.  For someone who wears contacts this works & doesn't leave me with oil spots all over my eyes because of the safer ingredients!  Glad I took a chance on this! #BuyBeautycounter!
2280 2018-03-15 19:15:28 Nice to see $RTI moving up again. Still over sold in my opinion. ACMPR license will have these guys churning out oil all day long.
2281 2018-03-15 19:15:19 Bitchhhhh I almost put oil drops in my eyes instead of eye drops
This is why I don’t wake up at 6am
2282 2018-03-15 19:15:11 What if it involves baby oil, lion bars & possibly getting naked 
2283 2018-03-15 19:15:09 Is prune juice an omega 3 fish oil?
2284 2018-03-15 19:15:06 The data I've seen conflates PKE with palm oil industry. As for maize... LCA always seems to be lacking opportunity cost of grass and stored carbon released from tillage.
2285 2018-03-15 19:15:03 @realDonaldTrump Drop the price of oil.........
2286 2018-03-15 19:14:59 Very deep.
2287 2018-03-15 19:14:55 Good news: The truck got it's oil change today.

Bad news: The truck has a bad wheel bearing that needs replacement on Monday. That's about $245 out the door
2288 2018-03-15 19:14:52 Oh, do you not see the irony? Shatner would make a better Navy commander than Krugman an economist.
2289 2018-03-15 19:14:41 I can’t speak to offshore sewage leaks but I can speak to oil sands reclamation, I see it everyday.  People just choose to put blinders on, so be it.  I’m not going to try to convince anyone from being ignorant, that’s on them
2290 2018-03-15 19:14:40 I agree the wall is a waste of money. As for where the money should go I’m not really sure. But NASAs ROI is 3 to 1 and the solar industry hires more people than oil and coal combined. So maybe we can invest in something useful.
2291 2018-03-15 19:14:34 My next ex husband will be one!!!  Btw... twitter won't let me see your comment because it's insensitive.

2293 2018-03-15 19:14:24 That is pretty much what we did. With some combing in the bath and then more leave in conditioner and masses of oil.
2294 2018-03-15 19:14:22 Sorry to tweet so late.... Can you guys get lavender  oil my mum would swear by it.... Take Care.
2295 2018-03-15 19:14:16 I barely ever do. If I do it’s coconut oil and not real lotion
2296 2018-03-15 19:14:06 difficult problem.  from my days in the explor/prod realm working Niobrara, Permian Bone Spring/Wolfcamp, the most profitable plays are the lightest/gassiest parts.  there you get the high flow rates to make profitable.  Reviewed San Joaquin where oil heavier, but plays marginal.

2301 2018-03-15 19:13:44 OMG I want it so much. Does it come in oil rubbed or antiqued bronze?
2302 2018-03-15 19:13:32 My sister is also living and working in Haiti. I was so impressed by how resourceful and creative Haitians were making use of what was available. Just look at the exceptional metal work they do in Croix-des-Bouquets with recycled oil drums.  Americans can be so wasteful.

2307 2018-03-15 19:12:34 The sugar in beets is like sugar in fruit..... not like sugar in a donut..... beets in a can organic and just put olive oil and cider vinegar salt pepper citrus zest... marinate and eat them!

2310 2018-03-15 19:12:02 How Analysts Feel About Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRZO...
2311 2018-03-15 19:12:00 Psalm 141:5 
Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me; It is oil upon the head; Do not let my head refuse it, For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.
2312 2018-03-15 19:11:59 They said one, and then I got my oil changed at the dealership and they said nothing after I mentioned it to them. 

Tire guy did say that, after like three years of use my tires were still in great shape.
2313 2018-03-15 19:11:57 Every Christian does this when they get a piece of land for worship. Some use oil. I think they used oil and holy water. I'm not Catholic so I don't know.
2314 2018-03-15 19:11:51 u think oil breaks below 60 ? thnx

2327 2018-03-15 19:09:50 sitting at my car dealership while i get an oil change and they’re playing obsessed by mariah carey....if that doesn’t prove i bought from the right place then idk what does
2328 2018-03-15 19:09:49 If he's actually serious about fixing the "good" trade deficit with Canada, all we have to do is move away from oil/gas and towards renewables.
2329 2018-03-15 19:09:46 Interesting (comical???) debate at @GLOBE_Series @CarbonBubble versus ARC Energy Research Institute. Is there a limit to how much oil & gas you can produce and will it lead to stranded assets???

2333 2018-03-15 19:09:14 Awwww thank you  he isn't so chilled when he is having oil applied it's very much ooooouch! 
2334 2018-03-15 19:08:54 Me when I arrive at the oil change store: “I would like my oil changed”
Guy: “Hello! *words I cannot understand because it’s loud*”
Me: “Uh, yeah! Go ahead!”
Guy: “Great!” *Smashes car into a cube and hands it to me*
2335 2018-03-15 19:08:52 Except he implied that they were ugly, not that the signs offended him.. but go on.. ‘well actually’ him into seeming like a normal person...
2336 2018-03-15 19:08:48 I love how they scream "you don't care about dead kids" one minute then demand a debate on the facts the next. There's no civil debate to be had with gun-grabbing pants-wetters.
2337 2018-03-15 19:08:48  i wish u would oil ur feet to
2338 2018-03-15 19:08:43 I need to go get an oil change but my bed my bed is Love

2341 2018-03-15 19:08:03 MIC (Macquarie) thrown out with other MLP's and has zero exposure to this that I can see in terms of current cash flow impact....they do have some storage assets but those are being converted from oil to other usage....MIC has aviation terminaling and gas sales in Hawaii....
2342 2018-03-15 19:07:57 A very fine jackass I should say.
2343 2018-03-15 19:07:48 #OBC isnt an Oil & Gas/Mining day traders stock ramped daily by P&Ders & the #VOX crew after being briefed etc. It's a #Blockchain roller-coaster play run by techies with a track record of success. News is tightly held. So if U can't take the downs with the ups then Move On!
2344 2018-03-15 19:07:45 There is actually a rumour on the Street in the Canadian oil & gas space.  Didn't think anybody cared enough. $RRX & $SPE merger.  Both up today more than average. $5 says there would be no rollback in combined entity.
2345 2018-03-15 19:07:25 I only love Iraqi oil I’m sorry
2346 2018-03-15 19:07:24 Based on his mode of execution, I can totally see it happening. He started an electric car revolution that is expected to reduce global demand for oil by 66% by the year 2045.
2347 2018-03-15 19:07:20 This coconut beard oil has taken my secksy to a whole 'nother level
2348 2018-03-15 19:07:14 ya but we have trees and oil.  you have services you want to sell us.  overall you sell more to us than we sell to you.  that's not "what he's talking about".  as he admitted, he spoke without knowing any fact whatsoever either way.
2349 2018-03-15 19:07:09 Prob shampoo or conditioner..gentle bath and I've oil BP on patches
2350 2018-03-15 19:07:06 #1 thing I love about Honda is anytime I come in to get my car fixed/oil changed, they wash it for me too.  #thelittlethings

2353 2018-03-15 19:06:33 It’s terrible. They’ve already run out of buckwheat blinis, organic tofu and saffron oil
2354 2018-03-15 19:06:30 a) Mr. Harper sold off AECL's Candu marketing arm to SNC-Lavalin and SNC hasn't had much luck with the technology. b) the future for bitumen is not exactly bright in a supply glut of better oil (some of which AB has (Divernay and Montney). US has shale, not bitumen, to exploit.
2355 2018-03-15 19:06:08 What’s even more embarrassing is that this admin has looted > twice more. Add the amount they’ve borrowed for no particular reason to the missing monies reported in different parastatals. Then add the $3bn from ECA for exploring oil in the North etc!!! $1bn for BH. Looting galore
2356 2018-03-15 19:05:59 It's 2018, what dumbass wouldn't oil his loaf pans?
2357 2018-03-15 19:05:54 Places r running out of water, more famine, drought, fire, flood, & storms. & this society wants to build pipelines to drain the last of the oil money before it's too late. It has enough nuclear weapons pointed @ each other to blast the planet
2358 2018-03-15 19:05:47 Anyone in the oil patch will tell you, Tillerson is the most dangerous, top down, iron fisted somb*tch in the business.  And that’s saying something. 

So whatever has happened in Foggy Bottom this past year, it ain’t a love feast.  How destabilized is State now?
#TrumpRussia
2359 2018-03-15 19:05:35 It's all fake. Fake armies, fake movies, fake meanings, fake wars. Yes, but people are unfortunately really dying. Syria is simple oil war by the West managing to move guilt to other people. Renewable Energy is a joke, no western gov wants that, otherwise the wouldn't be power.

2387 2018-03-15 19:01:23 I will suggest that it's because AB has a sense of entitlement to a perpetual streets-paved-with-oil-gold boom. If one is not forthcoming something should be done by a politician. Even promises that can't be kept (Jason Kenney) are acceptable.

2404 2018-03-15 19:00:09 Your nipple looks like it hates you so much that it’s trying to pull away from your body.
2405 2018-03-15 19:00:05 Thank god Dodge put this oil filter in a easy spot to get to. No seriously thank you. Pretty simple
2406 2018-03-15 18:59:54 Love it. And having a shit the next day is like pouring a bucket of oil down the khazi 
2407 2018-03-15 18:59:45 Baaaaaaaaa! Baaaaaaaaaaaaa!
2408 2018-03-15 18:59:33 Energy companies, supermarkets, oil and car fuel, raw materials to start with....
2409 2018-03-15 18:59:31 He forgot to add anointing oil on the forehead and blessed mantle (white handkerchief)  on the other hand... 
Just to greet people in the village...

2410 2018-03-15 18:59:31 There is a special layer of hell dedicated to people who bring fried food on a plane. Spoiler alert: it’s boiling crisco oil.
2411 2018-03-15 18:59:21 Once the facts are laid bare the picture will come into clear focus, even the Donnie faithful MIGHT begin to realize that they supported a snake oil salesman and were raked over the coals.
2412 2018-03-15 18:59:10 I know right? It makes sense that insulting teenage girls on twitter would make you feel better about your micropenis.
2413 2018-03-15 18:59:05 i hope that's oil you're showing and not blood on the ground
2414 2018-03-15 18:58:45 The representative for the Bahamas tourism bureau said when God created everything he gave oil to the Mideast, diamonds and gold to Africa and technology to America. When he got to the Bahamas he realized he had given everything away. So he said, I will just live here. 
2415 2018-03-15 18:58:34 Is not blood, is car engine oil….
2416 2018-03-15 18:58:27 BC still needs the Trans Mountain pipeline for BC needs though, or we will still be tankering in oil from the US along the coast.

2419 2018-03-15 18:58:11 Please G-d smile down on this nation and bless us with:
1. Voter ID law
2. Free speech on the major SM networks
3. Strong high-quality infrastructure
4. Law & Order
5. The Wall
6. Credit Reform & fiscal reform
7. Good trade
8. Steel, oil, & full control over our mining & farming
2420 2018-03-15 18:58:03 Pretty sure that’s transmission fluid or oil.
2421 2018-03-15 18:58:02 Not even, it's the midnight oil burning hours of the hustlers to get to the top 
2422 2018-03-15 18:58:01 Who wanna come change my oil & put some antifreeze in my car ? Ion kno how 
2423 2018-03-15 18:57:59 i take vit D, fish oil, and some supplement for hair/skin/nail. sometimes at night i take melatonin as well... i eat 1-2 mandarin daily, sometimes more. or an apple... idk if i still need more...
2424 2018-03-15 18:57:49 That’s probably oil or other vehicle liquid.  #ihope
2425 2018-03-15 18:57:47 They also do vegan toiletries so I'm trying new shampoo/conditioner/hair serum/hair oil!
2426 2018-03-15 18:57:26 Do you notice a grown adult male talking about young girls with a picture that shows of his man nipples? How weird are you bro?

2437 2018-03-15 18:55:26 ^This. In order to reach your conclusion you looked at a picture of teenage girls and asked yourself "Are they on a path to hotness?" The problem isn't that you said they weren't, it's that you asked the question in the first place. Fucking creepy dude.
2438 2018-03-15 18:55:24 Another Democrat failing....completely ignoring by most of you, the lands stolen from Native Americans for dirty profit! Oil. Mining.  These people have suffered under white rule far longer than DACA people. Pay attention to our original people!
2439 2018-03-15 18:55:10 You're downing sunflower oil from a jar with Professor Lucy K. Weaver under Vice Principal Fowler's house. A warmth runs through your wrist.

2441 2018-03-15 18:54:56 A relationship is like a car, if you want it to last you have to make sure it’s serviced periodically.

2442 2018-03-15 18:54:54 it wasn’t too too bad but i hated the outdoor smell. the dry shampoo did mask it. after a while of not being able to fully get rid of it they had to go. but i had the freedom to oil and moisturize my hair.
2443 2018-03-15 18:54:46 These people changing my oil really just tried to talk me into $50 windshield wipers. My poor ass can just deal with a streaky, non visible windshield, thanks.
2444 2018-03-15 18:54:40 Controlled immigration should be one of the highest objective working . The oil is at min and the temp is rising.
2445 2018-03-15 18:54:40 No future n oil ? 
Even with oil as low as $10 a barrel , but with 100% OF OIL REVENUE coming to Scotland and only 5.5 million Scots to support, we are still HUGELY minted!!!
2446 2018-03-15 18:54:32 This is weird... Politics and church it's oil and water...
2447 2018-03-15 18:54:29 War is business. America and her  fellow imperialists are destroying oil rich countries such as Middle East and North Africa.
2448 2018-03-15 18:54:23 Three isn’t it? Notice the lemon there which is used after the oil as in tequila!
2449 2018-03-15 18:54:15 #Senado @newsdario *HOy en el Senado se presentará un pedido de informe sobre el tema OIL impulsado por el senador @ArmandoTraferri *
2450 2018-03-15 18:54:04 Mood I’m so bad about getting my oil changed.
2451 2018-03-15 18:54:02 I completely get it. The trim will stimulate growth (at least in my case it did). I have been decidedly growing mine since 2015/05. Lately been using some protein and oil infused products, and vitamins but still it's not as thick as it used to be.
2452 2018-03-15 18:53:59 Y’all, Josh changed my car oil when I got home from work last night at like 10pm and then got up early this morning to make me coffee, breakfast, and pack my lunch for work. I really do have the best bf ever 
2453 2018-03-15 18:53:59 So is 20 bags of tea in 1 cup of water steeped overnight and allowed to reduce.  So is espresso coffee reduced to a handful and mixed with a little oil.
2454 2018-03-15 18:53:29 Oil is changed and the invitations are picked up and the fancy stamps are purchased. @AmandaKamman
2455 2018-03-15 18:53:09 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2456 2018-03-15 18:52:58 I've used apple vinegar or coconut oil for my pets, but I think it's better to ask the vet because every skin irritation is different, and it depends on the dog's breed 
2457 2018-03-15 18:52:47 Maggie....Maybe when your Oil makes it out of the ground, then u could be happier than or as happy as  them? 
2458 2018-03-15 18:52:38 The one I just had on was avocado and rice oil, and I could only keep it on for a minute because I started to have a reaction to it

2462 2018-03-15 18:52:03 I’m hella pissed, everyone says tea tree oil is the best ever for your skin for acne & I literally had one problem area on my face & I used it & now my face is 5x more fricked.

2465 2018-03-15 18:51:22 Ok my career is heating and a/c, so i should just shut up and wash coils? Let an auto mechanic change the oil in my car??? Because i dont know about changing oil!!
2466 2018-03-15 18:51:18 The older they are the better they look. But. It takes forever for them to get old. Lol. And by the time it does get old ur scalp is fine but there’s no way to get oil/moisture to your ends and length of hair.

2474 2018-03-15 18:50:12 Crude oil futures settle at $61.19/BBL Up $0.23 ore 0.38%
The high reached $61.54. The low reached $60.82.  The settled price is near the midpoint of the day's trading range. 
Technically, the contract is settling just below the 100 hour MA at $61.23.  The 200 hour MA is at …
2475 2018-03-15 18:50:11 I should have said that WD40 will help get oil based paint out. It won't help with water based paint
2476 2018-03-15 18:49:52 So many beautiful ones about tho. Better than ever and lovely and light. Some on the market are so heavy with bulked out carrier oils. These are entirely different in that respect. Seems I have been hijacked by the organic cold pressed oil trade lol .. realyl have!
2477 2018-03-15 18:49:40 Most of the time it was just endless scripted comments, all virtually identical. "Build it" or "windmills kill birds" or "solar batteries are more toxic than oil" etc. Floods of the same no value commentary or misinfo. And some was nasty, similar to 1993 War in the Woods stuff.

2489 2018-03-15 18:47:11 Why are we in Syria:   Because it's a bypass for oil and gas.   Because it's not under the control of the global international banking system.  Because it's the core of human civilization of our times, so is Iraq.  The gods were black, Jesus was black and yeah I'm white
2490 2018-03-15 18:46:56 For immediate relief I would wash with lukewarm water to get off the product that was used (no blow dry). Then olive oil on the spots that he scratches. Good luck x
2491 2018-03-15 18:46:50 To start the year? Hopefully quite low
2492 2018-03-15 18:46:20 We have a $12.5 billion trade surplus with Canada. But, if we’re so concerned about not getting a fair shake from our neighbors to the north, why did we agree to build them so many oil pipelines? #TrumpLies #TrumpLiesMatter
2493 2018-03-15 18:46:16 Unfortunately, you started way too late. There is no option to ease into a low carbon economy without creating catastrophic climatic effects. The oil and gas industry -(why must they think of it as an ends in itself) have spent too long in denial.
2494 2018-03-15 18:46:02 Also what if, this little thing called common sense showed that cooking oil and and the type of oil mined from the ground were different?
2495 2018-03-15 18:46:01 Shaving with baby oil>>>>> busting your ass cause the baby oil got everywhere
2496 2018-03-15 18:45:56 Could it be that ‘equal responsibilities’ is the missing part of the equation? I.e. Does QB provide more free services like secondary education, & daycare? Should other taxpayers indirectly reimburse QB for unCanadian oil? No. #canpoli

2499 2018-03-15 18:45:04 Dale is it oil base paint or latex? If you read the paint, it should say "clean up" and you'll know if it's oil or latex. If it's latex just water will do the trick, oil then just a little paint thinner. Nothing more, simple.
2500 2018-03-15 18:44:43 They can’t steal Russian wealth or control its leader, like so many other country’s , they can not bully Russia but the west can gang up impose sanctions to try to stop the growth of its economy. That’s what this is about, money, oil , greed as always.
2501 2018-03-15 18:44:41 I muted the sickening woman trying to demean these kids for protesting. Here's my final point: real criticism is always good and encouraged. This wasn't criticism, this was a gross sexual shaming of children. If you cant tell the difference get some help.
2502 2018-03-15 18:44:39 Men like Trump, Putin + the rest of the demon Allumi-Natzi league want that ice cap melted so they can start drilling for oil. Greed + power junkies in suits. They are vampires of humanity + life itself.

2504 2018-03-15 18:44:24 I don’t like the crochet ones. They too uniformed for me. I like the more natural look. I loved/hated them.  You can only get moisture oil to ur scalp with em. Not ur actual hair. It’s good for really short term. Depends on how ur stylist do em if they’re...
2505 2018-03-15 18:44:22 If you have confidence that agriculture is d way to go...then free up crude oil to d real owners...then tax every resources evenly
2506 2018-03-15 18:43:56 how did those maggots survive in hot oil
2507 2018-03-15 18:43:56 I was supposed to do the brakes on my car and change the oil. Instead a nice nap sounds better.
2508 2018-03-15 18:43:52 I understand your points.  At least the generalities. But I have repeatedly found when told a problem can't be solved, industry does.  US can never reach 10mbd again, shale oil won't work, Permian's heyday over, peak prod/demand passed. Some new tech/new solution comes along.
2509 2018-03-15 18:43:32 The reason the US has a trade surplus is because we are forced to sell our oil to the USA for fraction of its true price BECAUSE YOUR PARTY WON’T LET US HAVE ACCESS TO WORLD MARKETS!
  Yet we pay full price for our current buddy’s oil (RUSSIA). UK “we’re with you”. Kinda

2518 2018-03-15 18:42:31 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2519 2018-03-15 18:42:31 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2520 2018-03-15 18:42:30 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
2521 2018-03-15 18:42:26 YES!! I thought about putting those as examples but they irritate me so much I cut them.
I know a LOT of people who consider themselves rational and scientific who believe ridiculous snake-oil-y health things.
2522 2018-03-15 18:42:24 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
2523 2018-03-15 18:42:17 I feel like the team owner who has a roster full of #1 draft picks (oil stocks) which aren't winning (stock prices rising).
2524 2018-03-15 18:42:14 .Youll notice this twit comes from a boorish Neanderthal.
2525 2018-03-15 18:42:08 This is why I fear for Lebanon and Jordan. Stable, modernized Middle Eastern nations are a good example that certain factions in the US and elsewhere find threatening. Turn the whole of ME into ISIS and it's easier to justify endless war for oil.
2526 2018-03-15 18:42:03 And THAT is the damn point. Canada is not putting anyone out off a job by importing lumber or oil. This country has more than enough demand for both.

2543 2018-03-15 18:38:50 my favorite @subway is toasted flatbread with american cheese, olives, pickles, oil, and vinegar. and there’s nothing u can do about it
2544 2018-03-15 18:38:50 The poor baby ! You can try a local application of Neem oil . It has medicinal as well as anti fungal properties . Also you might want to ask the groomer regarding any changes in the shampoo/ conditioner used on Paul. Hope he gets back to his normal self soon

2549 2018-03-15 18:38:09 Cbd oil has thc in it but the amount of THC will depend on how high you get. High cbd oil with low thc shouldn’t make you high. It’s good stuff. THC is what makes you impaired. The others like 1:1 cbd to thc or low cbd with high thc oils will give you a high.

2565 2018-03-15 18:37:22 Actually my problem isn't with the teens saying stupid things. I remember being a teen and saying a whole plethora of stupid things. I have two teens and they say stupid stuff too.

My issues is with the parents & teachers who don't correct them when they do because of politics
2566 2018-03-15 18:37:15 The only way the US can claim a trade deficit is A) counting oil (which isn't fair--Canada could never buy enough consumer goods to make up for the oil we export) and B) Double-counting imports that land in Canada and pass through to the US (COMPLETE misrepresentation)

2570 2018-03-15 18:36:50 Simple sir. (1) get palm oil (2) get a container (preferably a rectangular shaped container) that will comfortably contain the quantity under consideration (3) put in a freezer and freeze for 2 weeks (4) bring out and break the container and you'll have your oil block(ed) sir

2573 2018-03-15 18:36:05 Everyone: We need more oil!

Texas: Uhuh. Go on...

2590 2018-03-15 18:34:28 No. I am not willing to acknowledge that because it's not true. Hope someday you see how horrible you're being here.

2593 2018-03-15 18:33:58 Do me a favour - read a book or at the very least have some critical thinking. If Scotland can grow without oil, why were oil figures baked into the 2014 referendum prospectus?
2594 2018-03-15 18:33:56 Feeling stuck? Try making some art using oil pastels - consider the concept of wasteland in a tarot style.
2595 2018-03-15 18:33:49 You have no idea what you are talking about. How does foreign oil get out of the ground without emissions? That is called upstream. Midstream is the pipeline transporting oil. Downstream is the refinery making the gasoline etc.

2601 2018-03-15 18:33:27 Putin is amazing. He’s basically the dictator of a 3rd world nation that is drinking itself to death yet he’s able to use the nations oil wealth as his personal slush fund for grandiose projects while the average Russian lives in misery. Not as bad as under Communism, but still?
2602 2018-03-15 18:33:25 Oil mining! Drilling lol
2603 2018-03-15 18:33:20 This is terrible news. I feel so sorry for the kid's who could be adversely affected by this snake oil peddling narcissistic.
2604 2018-03-15 18:33:20 The whole damn GOP is corrupt, a bunch of slimy snake oil salesmen!  They shamelessly represent, not those who elected them, but their obscenely wealthy, big business corporate donors.  They thumb their noses at their real constituents.  Who’s Joe Blow who only donated $100?

2607 2018-03-15 18:32:56 I'm completely appalled to still have no oil despite ordering through Butler Fuels on Feb 25! Appalling service if you can ever get through, too! I have a baby and toddler and have been heating the house using expensive electricity. V disappointed.
2608 2018-03-15 18:32:39 The red line in the sand has been crosssed. Trump knows his show is about to be canceled. He will scream and kick and bite and pinch and order indiscriminate chaos and destruction and set the oil wells on fire. They will find him hiding between floors at Trump Tower or M A Lago.
2609 2018-03-15 18:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2610 2018-03-15 18:32:26 The pizzeria owner should close his shop, move to a western state with no income tax, and ruin the property he leaves behind, so it cannot be taxed. Every other small restaurant owner should do the same. I'm not quite at the stage where I'm suggesting boiling politicians in oil..
2611 2018-03-15 18:32:25 Derek is a pant load.
2612 2018-03-15 18:32:20 No, but if they did, I'd suggest they charge the importers, Quebec, Ontario and BC based on the total environmental cost as they do Canadian producers. Or the environmental differential between Cdn. oil and oil from elsewhere, including the greenhouse cost of transportation.
2613 2018-03-15 18:32:18 Looks like a failed close above the bunghole

2615 2018-03-15 18:31:59 Then u fry it with red oil. U gotta improvise
2616 2018-03-15 18:31:59 So true.  Also the effects of oil spills.  That's why so many of us on the coast are worrying about your government's plan to increase oil tanker traffic off the coast of Vancouver from 5 to 34 per month.
2617 2018-03-15 18:31:56 I guess if they don't look like female relatives of yours then you don't find them attractive.
2618 2018-03-15 18:31:55 The very point of the tax is to reduce carbon emissions - which means a reduction in certain economic activities. Given Canada’s economic dependence on oil, its lunacy to suppose there won’t be a “disaster” (localized as it may be).
2619 2018-03-15 18:31:21 Ahh yes, I have oily skin so I shall try more oil. People need to mind their own damn business 
2620 2018-03-15 18:31:04 Your a fail oil troll
2621 2018-03-15 18:30:55 Hubs & I do tend to divide off on 'traditional' roles around the house, me doing the cleaning, cooking, etc, he handles the 'man shit' outside, like oil changes and mowing, but either of us can do the other's job if need be and skillfully.
2622 2018-03-15 18:30:46 #IxoraBBSkinCareTips oily skin types can benefit from double exfoliation due to how much oil and dirt build up in their pores over time.
2623 2018-03-15 18:30:40 The “hotness” was sexualizing
2624 2018-03-15 18:30:40 Currently the slate of products comes from the oil produced. The slate cannot change much because of inflexibility of refinery configs. So when product demand forecasts show largest demand growth in mid distillates it suggests to produce that you need a heavier than averagebarrel
2625 2018-03-15 18:30:40 Ok. No more raw timber or wood no more oil. No more steel. We’ll sell to China.

2640 2018-03-15 18:29:50 I still need an oil change for my car and my eyebrows done.
2641 2018-03-15 18:29:43 Canada increased their money supply to bid down the value of their dollar to prop up oil exports because the value of oil is low lately. A low Canadian dollar promotes exports because Canadian goods seem cheap to those with foreign dollars.

2643 2018-03-15 18:29:13 So this guy was working on our neighbours gutter and had to use our back yard. He moved all the bins & didn’t move them back, also snapped my washing line and left the gate open. I am fuming. He left his linseed oil putty here tho so I’ll put it in the bin, fucker.

2647 2018-03-15 18:28:26 Fair criticism is never a problem. This wasn't fair criticism. Protesting is MEANT to incite and possibly offend to shake perceptions and move the status quo. Your attention towards the concept of protesters being fair play for criticism shows how myopic you are.

2661 2018-03-15 18:27:18 Can I oil you up please
2662 2018-03-15 18:27:08 I beg to differ. Military spending is out of control,  the US is involved in 8 wars, all for what? Oil and resources. The budget would be better spent on infrastructure, education and job training. Not $700 billion for wars we should not even be involved in.
2663 2018-03-15 18:27:04 honestly....i stopped reading after that because i was nervous he was gonna fuck him with that olive oil bottle
2664 2018-03-15 18:27:00 Haven't used them in a while, but I used to put 3 or 4 pans on the hob, split a tin between them and build the recipe from there. The onions are so well lubricated with oil I didn't have to add any more either
2665 2018-03-15 18:26:50 Thx 
2666 2018-03-15 18:26:50 At least one of them will end up morbidly obese. Sad!

2669 2018-03-15 18:26:22 You can't count natural resources like oil, and that's the only thing that makes it a deficit. Canada's small consumer market could never buy enough goods from the US to right that. In manufactured goods/services, US has a surplus with Canada.
2670 2018-03-15 18:26:19 The fact that you are STILL hedging and parsing to try and paint these girls as in some way being too offensive to not face some kind of criticism, when NO ONE IS ARGUING AGAINST THAT, is disgusting in and of itself.
2671 2018-03-15 18:26:17 For a start your tweet is anything BUT mature and secondly you'll never have Jacks cutting wit and intelligence. You're a braindead leeming who'd follow Oil off a cliff if he jumped.  The man is RIPPING YOU OFF and you can't see it.

It's heartbreaking to see this. I look for palm oil in products before I buy - and unfortunately it's in so much.
2681 2018-03-15 18:25:44 Truffle oil but yes it's key
2682 2018-03-15 18:25:22 Distributed currency was just the beginning. Distributed data exchanges in an age and time where data is the new "oil" will be where the next great battle will be fought at. Haven't had something capture so much of my interest in a long time.
2683 2018-03-15 18:25:11 Nah smh I was really clapppped off some oil 
2684 2018-03-15 18:25:07 Thank you.  I sent money for rice and oil so that the village could celebrate the finishing of the solar borehole.  It is a happy day in Batti.
2685 2018-03-15 18:25:07 The unacceptable part was you sexualizing minors. Calling an adult ugly because you can't form a logical response is an ad hominem attack. Calling teenage girls ugly is the same, plus people start to wonder why you're commenting on the hotness of minors.
2686 2018-03-15 18:25:04 Well any physical hotness you may or may not have had- you are beyond ugly now.   And btw, when kids are bleeding out on the floor, what they look like doesn’t come into play, you phucking jackass.

2688 2018-03-15 18:24:58 Probably hanging out with Rudy Guliani. Haven't seen much of him since the election.
2689 2018-03-15 18:24:50 I got this free lavender CBD oil pen the other day and it's probably my favorite thing
2690 2018-03-15 18:24:49 We build the pipelines and then we let the market decide whether they want to buy our oil. It's not Alberta's money that is being spent in the pipeline or the oil production, it's investors' money. If those investors are wrong, then let them go bankrupt. Let the market decide.
2691 2018-03-15 18:24:39 my hair is on its last possible day of no wash before she turns into oil slick city so someone call BP bc im letting it happen
2692 2018-03-15 18:24:26 Not if choice is predicated by wealth in a top-down system that punishes poor people making sure they receive less access to education. Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.
2693 2018-03-15 18:24:23 Every black dude I work with has a CCW and go nowhere without packing.
2694 2018-03-15 18:24:19 FALCE! Getting our oil and LNG to shoreline is our way to prosperity and growth!! Our parks are important but focus on the economic importance of exports!
2695 2018-03-15 18:24:15 SOUNDS LIKE A READBLE PATTERN OF THE UK,USA,AUST KKK govtGroupTERRORISTS TARGETING PUTIN & RUSSIA again in an agenda for STEALING LAND, FOR OIL & GAS MINING EXPLORATIONS...ITS ALL THESE TERRORISTS know!
2696 2018-03-15 18:23:44 The state of wyo is a nazi piece of corrupt shit state over the greed of oil for a profit of c.m.t
2697 2018-03-15 18:23:44 Oil and gas will eventually run out. It should be immoral not to invest now into renewables and alternatives to improve the technology abd make it more reliable so they are able to take over when oil and gas eventually runs out.
2698 2018-03-15 18:23:26 weird...it's almost as if russia wants to sell oil
2699 2018-03-15 18:23:23 I bought some mandarin orange essential oil to put in my humidifier because I love oranges.

It smells like a grandma. Floral mothballs. It gives me a headache. I hate it so much.
2700 2018-03-15 18:23:17 They are pretending they are burning the land for oil but in reality they are burning it for a new alien life form to start living in Indonesia
2701 2018-03-15 18:23:05 Russia is not a superpower through is it?  It's a crumbling petrostate which has nothing going for it but it's oil reserves and an overinflated nuclear arsenal
2702 2018-03-15 18:23:04 I hope UK  freezes and grabs all Russian assets.  This hurts all the Kleptocrats.  Russia is a bad actor  all around.  Selling oil and coal to North Korea and possibly nuke materials.  Perhaps sharing cyber attacks with N. Korea too.  Trump=krill to the whales.
2703 2018-03-15 18:23:04 Who cares what they look like? What does that have to do with anything?
2704 2018-03-15 18:23:03 If our oil was not economically competitive and people did not want our product, then why are they spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to keep it from the market. Fact is other oil producers are scared of us. We have lots and it's cheap and clean.
2705 2018-03-15 18:22:47 Au contraire, the entire case for independence was based on lies, misrepresentations, over and under  estimations when it suited its dubious case.

Look at the economic plan, the foundation of it was oil, of course they denied it was at the time.

We all know the truth now.
2706 2018-03-15 18:22:40 It works, I use that and emu oil combined together.
2707 2018-03-15 18:22:38 Where is the push to unlock some of the tech that is being held in patent jail?Plenty of option owned by big oil
2708 2018-03-15 18:22:33 I’m wearing essential oil perfume for the first time in forever and it’s giving me asthma. Lmao.
2709 2018-03-15 18:22:28 Do these contain any cutting agent? Or are they indeed pure C02 oil with only terpenes? I can't do MCT.
2710 2018-03-15 18:22:25 Isn’t he the one that went up in the Shuttle and did an experiment on whether oil and water still separate at Zero G?
2711 2018-03-15 18:22:24 Talk to Ken er I mean Justin and get our oil and LNG to shoreline! Please!
2712 2018-03-15 18:22:24 Does beard oil really work g?
2713 2018-03-15 18:22:23 Oil and solid fuel on HHCRO yes in the main. Email what you have and I'll let you know asap
2714 2018-03-15 18:22:15 also just a thought Indonesia is burning their entire land for palm oil to keep their economy in the global system. SO what if they found something not human while destroying their land OR
2715 2018-03-15 18:22:11 "Children: we should let them vote and dictate public policy, but don't dare call them ugly!" LOLDERP
2716 2018-03-15 18:21:57 olive oil, salt, lemon juice, cucumber, coriander leaves, iceberg lettuce. Chop all up into bowl, chuck in tuna flakes, mix in the liquid bits (olive oil and lemon juice). Me and DiGi live on tuna salad. You can also swap out the tuna for diced chicken. So damn good.
2717 2018-03-15 18:21:45 요즘 cvs 에서도 파는데  tea tree oil 사서 입술에 발라 보세요

2726 2018-03-15 18:20:49 came home to some red oil potatoes green 
2727 2018-03-15 18:20:47 I need to wash my car but i wont because I changed my oil. It's pretty on the inside.
2728 2018-03-15 18:20:46 I was already annoyed having to spend $90 on the oil change to begin with

2734 2018-03-15 18:20:14 98% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real, happening, and is anthropomorphic. The other 2% are unsure or are paid by big oil. Out of 14000 scientific papers, 23 say otherwise, and when checked the majority have major flaws in their procedures or analysis.
2735 2018-03-15 18:20:09 Wii talk to my uncle, he is a manager in Okitipupa palm oil farm.
2736 2018-03-15 18:20:08 Needa go change my oil
2737 2018-03-15 18:19:42 i'll tell the to hold on...run upstairs get some "It's A 10" hair detangler...and a vat of Oil Of Olay...tell her please use these and maybe so perioasis cream
2738 2018-03-15 18:19:39 I thought about that. In SC, the vaping oil was like 1/3 the price. And my spouse said I could always go out for the national vaping championships. I died when I saw the videos!

2740 2018-03-15 18:19:16 Ang sarap sa feeling ng baby oil kahit I'm not anyone's baby 
2741 2018-03-15 18:19:04 Covering myself in bio oil then have to sit there naked for 15 mins waiting for it to sink in hahahah #pregnancyproblems
2742 2018-03-15 18:19:01 Yea I feel like I’m not going to like my hair without oil so I might continue to keep using grapeseed oil. My hair gets dry really fast
2743 2018-03-15 18:19:00 Cenovus's SAGD can produce a barrel of oil at $11. Shale needs huge amounts of investment because the half-life of a field is very short. So far that has been driven mostly be cheap credit and investors. Long term it might not be sustainable.
2744 2018-03-15 18:18:52 Jaitley had said immediately after being sworn in as Finance Minister that India had “hit” a sweet spot in terms of oil prices and global growth. He was partly right - the global growth has not affected India as our foreign trade - even in volume terms - has collapsed.
2745 2018-03-15 18:18:46 Love avocado oil! It feels amazing on skin 
2746 2018-03-15 18:18:27 This is all about the oil.  I think they want global warming also. So they can get to the oil!
2747 2018-03-15 18:18:22 The economy of India is doing better than it did in 2013. But it did far better from 2004–09, and again in 2011–12.

The reason we are doing better is the crash in crude oil prices. Despite his habit of gross exaggeration.
2748 2018-03-15 18:18:03 paint thinner, kerosene, goop off in can not spray, if it's oil base, bacon grease works on some.
2749 2018-03-15 18:17:55 - see the two lines at the bottom? That’s the max and min you always want it between the two. This one is so the oil isn’t a problem.”
2750 2018-03-15 18:17:43 So use olive oil instead of olive oil?
2751 2018-03-15 18:17:43 Actually, the cause of most of the last 20 odd wars was a single denominator...Oil, (Or something else that we are not talking about right now...rare earths etc) so basically one war is exactly the same as another...and the protagonists are always the same ones...CIA/MI5, etc etc
2752 2018-03-15 18:17:28 Do you source palm oil responsibly? Thank you.
2753 2018-03-15 18:17:08 - the way to check is to pull this out —“

Pulling out the dipstick, doing the next set of actions as he talked through then to Carl. 

“Always check when the car is flat, wipe the oil that’s off it then pop it back in. When you take it out this time it’ll show you the level -
2754 2018-03-15 18:17:07 Where do zero emissions cars get their energy from?
Could it be from gas , oil or coal fired power stations?
How eco friendly are lithium batteries?
Will they still run on rubber tyres?
A thousand questions on "green" vehicles.
2755 2018-03-15 18:17:06 Fun fact, Canada is the number one supplier of oil to the US.
2756 2018-03-15 18:17:02 Tankers cause emissions.  What the  oil is used for causes emissions. Processing imported oil causes emissions.  So Timmothy, I  think you have the stupid one confised. Were you lokking in the mirror ehen you tweeted?
2757 2018-03-15 18:17:01 Yes, too much oil maybe? Idk but I’m gonna drink tea when I get home and feel better (hope so)
2758 2018-03-15 18:16:57 The Alberta gov't does not control the price of oil, it's a global commodity. When the price tanks so does our royalty revenue. When the gov't adds new taxes on already low prices, oil companies stop spending.
2759 2018-03-15 18:16:57 No but I did put on some baby oil 
2760 2018-03-15 18:16:57 Exact representation of how the oil looks on ice this year.  Back to the basement we go...
2761 2018-03-15 18:16:56 Forever waiting for this oil change and tire rotation
2762 2018-03-15 18:16:54 I thought it was you trying to check your oil.
2763 2018-03-15 18:16:44 Coconut oil feels so good on your body 
2764 2018-03-15 18:16:40 Never go to Valvoline for an oil change wow they're trash
2765 2018-03-15 18:16:35 Thought I needed to get my oil changed. Halfway there I realized it needed to be changed at 136,500 miles and my car was at 136,493. By the time I got there it would have been right at the number and I was too embarrassed for that to happen so I turned around and went home.
2766 2018-03-15 18:16:33 #OUvsURI. Right now is where a defensive stop is needed and OU and defense are like oil & water
2767 2018-03-15 18:16:27 Black bean burritos/tacos! Soooooooooooo good!! And super cheap lol all you really need to buy is the black beans and some tortillas if u don’t already have it!! I season mine with salt, pepper, cayenne, cumin, paprika, garlic & onion powder and some olive oil 
2768 2018-03-15 18:16:23 Or Mexico.
2769 2018-03-15 18:16:20 I wonder why you find it hard to believe liberals like to own guns and hunt in similar numbers to most conservatives.
2770 2018-03-15 18:16:18 Visit Morocco now !!! Before it's the next Saudi Arabia after the oil runs out.
2771 2018-03-15 18:16:12 There is no ending this -  and of all other leaders the USA would have had at this time, they have the most tactically incompetent ever. Of course, he is at the mercy of the Federal Reserve, Military Contractors, and |Oil profiteers.
2772 2018-03-15 18:16:03 Got to the bit about needing weaned of oil and chucked it. He needs to do a bit more research, oil is the cherry on the cake. Maybe he still believes in GERS
2773 2018-03-15 18:15:56 I have shitty acne scars from taking accutane. vitamin E oil has been somewhat helpful. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion should help. Come with me to get one
2774 2018-03-15 18:15:41 Connections worked free of the battery Rick only stopped pulling the heavy object out at Carl’s question. Using his forearm to wipe away the sweat starting to form on his brow from the blistering sun as not to leave oil from his now covered hands. 

“Where you put the oil in -
2775 2018-03-15 18:15:40 Most Analysts I have come across work the big picture and dont work the details of a refinery operation. The answer I have most had has been it will work itself out with price. Now as I said above price is not the only factor a refiner buys a crude oil.
2776 2018-03-15 18:15:35 Jiffy Lube with the oil/coolant/brake JOOG
2777 2018-03-15 18:15:32 Not feeling it AT OIL!!!!
2778 2018-03-15 18:15:29 Make or break here.  Will oil break down or hold at 60.16 again?
2779 2018-03-15 18:15:27 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2780 2018-03-15 18:15:27 You don't think citizens should own handguns? You do know handguns are semi automatic right?
2781 2018-03-15 18:15:23 COCKPIT. RED TEN'S COCKPIT. Wedge dives out of the oil pipe toward them.
2782 2018-03-15 18:15:22 He’s not a very good speller, it’s America!!
2783 2018-03-15 18:15:18 People do hunt with a ARs. 
The military version isn't semi-auto.

So now you look stupid on two different subjects.
2784 2018-03-15 18:15:11 I’m taking the oil. I didn’t want to buy a vape 
2785 2018-03-15 18:15:07 Yeah let’s see how the coast does without the farms and oil in CA
2786 2018-03-15 18:15:04 it all started with me forgetting to put on deodorant lmao I basically just put eucalyptus oil on a folded paper towel and wiped it on my pitsI smell good and it feels super cool
2787 2018-03-15 18:14:40 What election did you win which gives you the privilege of speaking for your community? Or did simply assume that entitlement of your own volition? Premier @RachelNotley - this is who you chose to be on your oil sands advisory panel. You owe Albertans an apology for your choice.
2788 2018-03-15 18:14:39 While putting essential oil in my diffuser, somehow got some in my eye.

Being zen is stressful.
2789 2018-03-15 18:14:13 You can vape cannabinoid oil, you know. It's... the IED of getting high.
2790 2018-03-15 18:14:05 Okay, I do play the part 3 by DU some...but, I only bring 1 club, 2 balls and 6 cans of swing oil.
2791 2018-03-15 18:14:01 Holly I realise this will be scant consolation but wanted to say I think these are really good. I love the rain effect of your threadwork and the humour of your oil painting - thought they were looking for some quirky humour this year too! I would have picked them both!
2792 2018-03-15 18:13:53 
Try not to think so much about
The truly staggering amount of oil that it takes to make a record
All the shipping, the vinyl, 
the cellophane lining, 
the high gloss
The tape and the gear....
Lets just call this what it is
The gentler side of mankind's death wish. 

2793 2018-03-15 18:13:51 Awesome, thanks cheds. Have you looked into Rick Simpson’s hemp oil to help with your cancer? Rooting for ya!
2794 2018-03-15 18:13:46 Production AND distribution. That oil doesn't coat the feathers by itself.
2795 2018-03-15 18:13:37 then drizzled with good olive oil>>>>
2796 2018-03-15 18:13:34 Guess I have to be nit pickin particular now. So Ont right behind Alta in Canadian oil production. Oh, no. There’s Sask, then Newfoundland and probably 6 others.
2797 2018-03-15 18:13:31 But China is allowing oil to go? GOD BLESS TEXAS & GOD BLESS THE USA.
2798 2018-03-15 18:13:28 Depends on how long the conflict is. My fears could be over in mere hours. Russia has huge oil reserves. We can frack but cost 2 do so is high. Crown Prince already made goo-goo eyes at Putin. Russia,China want in on IPO Aranco but now so does UK.
2799 2018-03-15 18:13:25 Disaffected youth with "outsider" complex due to poor emotional development and prison-like school system designed to crank out mindless borgs apparently doesn't feature in the root-cause-analysis.

2803 2018-03-15 18:13:07 Latex paint will just wash out. Oil base needs paint thinner. Very simple. No WD40 or Peanut Butter necessary.

2807 2018-03-15 18:12:43 Pinterest has lots of recipes. One has beets, carrots, Granny Smith apples, lemon juice and olive oil.
2808 2018-03-15 18:12:39 Yes, the soy bean is made up mostly of meal, the oil being the minor part (by volume) hence a lot of waste if you don't feed it to animals. If you want to cut production cut soy oil out of your diet and livestock farmers won't be able to afford soy bean meal as a protein source.
2809 2018-03-15 18:12:33 what remaining US to do? US nigher invited by Gov nor by UN but Invading Syria & supporting, arming terrorist 2pay ppl 4 oil!

They are sorry
2811 2018-03-15 18:12:14 Careful...hot oil is not very forgiving!
2812 2018-03-15 18:11:54 Saudi Arabia is pretending to modernize/half-voluntarily modernizing against vast internal resistance, because they need a high valuation and lots of investors to dump the sick cow Aramco on, now that oil is on the way out.
2813 2018-03-15 18:11:51 I feel like my skin will crack off my body and die if I don't use my lotion oil mixture.

2815 2018-03-15 18:11:26 Childish? Maybe.
Pedo? No.

Beginning to see the difference?
2816 2018-03-15 18:11:22 Hi Ian! Onions softened in oil & butter. Added spices. Then minced garlic and lentils. Celery chunks. Then stock. Cook for 30 mins. Add salt. Cook another 15 mins. If lentils soft, then blend, season, respice and reheat. Do you want the recipe?
2817 2018-03-15 18:11:08 I wish my car wasn't so low so when I'm smacked someone else could drive it. I'd probably wake up wit no bumper and broken oil pan if I did that rn
2818 2018-03-15 18:11:04 I’m so late on this oil change

2821 2018-03-15 18:10:49 +were do many 'no blood for oil' protests. People watched the news, got maps of Saudi, Kuwait. Learnt about the culture, sad about the decision representative made. Bush wasn't re-elected. 
There is so much crazy reasoning govt gives so it is against people either side of its+

2823 2018-03-15 18:10:41 Hello Ian, I know this post is a few years old, but could I ask why you used butter instead of oil in your carrot cake? Was it a better flavor or texture. I found most carrot cakes use oil and they are moist and refrigerate better.
2824 2018-03-15 18:10:27 Oil! Cannabis oil. But its too pricy for the amount i go thru lol
2825 2018-03-15 18:10:22 Selling lettuce with ketchup and oil squirted on it as food should be illegal and I should get to punch everyone that works at the Greek food place by my work
2826 2018-03-15 18:10:09 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
2827 2018-03-15 18:09:55 the scent of tree oil still lingers in my room and it’s making me nauseous
2828 2018-03-15 18:09:54 Armed and fabulous.
2829 2018-03-15 18:09:50 hey, i am told this is wrong and that a different species of human exists in West Virginia, where drinking oil and inhaling dirty air is Good.
2830 2018-03-15 18:09:34 Talk to you later there's a real nice oil trade setting up that I'd like to catch. Up up and away
2831 2018-03-15 18:09:33 "Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. lt is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth."
2832 2018-03-15 18:09:32 not too late to build a giant sea wall around Tepco FUKISHIMA drop oil tankers filled with concrete end to end then seal up around the ends stop the radioactive poisoning of our Pacific Ocean
2833 2018-03-15 18:09:16 If he sold then big oil would scrap the entire thing, he may not be making money on it but he's showing the people that the technology is here, and that it can be used now, and that we don't need to be completely dependent on fossil fuels.
2834 2018-03-15 18:09:10 Or Armyvet drive up the price 2 make fracking profitable. When oil price down,fracking shuts down. US exports oil
2835 2018-03-15 18:08:52 Hope you get better Karl! Keep fighting brother.
You tried cannabis oil? Supposed to help
2836 2018-03-15 18:08:36 Compliment their car. "I have an uncle that had one of those for over 20 years! If you do the regular oil changes you can get a lotta mileage outta that thing. Japanese engineering. Solid."
2837 2018-03-15 18:08:25 Coconut oil at night! Hydrates and makes your skin look fresh and soft in the morning 
2838 2018-03-15 18:08:03 @IntlPaperCo Will the corporate HQ be helping to address the oil spill into the pristine McKenzie River in Springfield, Oregon, caused by IP's mill?  It's truly a beautiful river and needs to be kept that way.  Thanks.

I can just end it 
I can just .....
2841 2018-03-15 18:07:50 Ewwwwwwwwwww
Fish oil burps
2842 2018-03-15 18:07:45 Ok babe. Try epimax junior. I don't think I like how magnolia oil feels on my skin. I wanna stop using it. Epimax is better for me
2843 2018-03-15 18:07:35 Incredible, she was being honest just couldn’t grasp it
2844 2018-03-15 18:07:32 So many flavour profiles with oils.
I certainly switch around with Italian and Spanish olive oils... but I do use a heck of a lot of Sainsbury's British Cold Pressed Rapeseed Oil (Taste the Difference)
2845 2018-03-15 18:07:29 World is geared for High API crude. US invested huge sums of money to add cokers starting roughly a decade ago because Orinoco and Tar Sands were the future. Globally the priciest oil is Malaysian Tapis 43-45 API.Many refineries are still shut due to lack of light crude.
2846 2018-03-15 18:07:28 Are you vaping or taking the concentrated oil? I did capon for some months for inflammation, migraines, and anxiety before the price was too much to continue. I'm not sure if it worked on my migraines, but it worked WONDERS on my anxiety.
2847 2018-03-15 18:06:46 im bone dry i just do music to inspire others waiting for my machine to get some oil
2848 2018-03-15 18:06:43 I refer here to your argument that comparing gun owners to Klan members is specious, with which I agree.  And if their message doesn’t deserve a response?  Why did you?
2849 2018-03-15 18:06:36 You want to try the cost of oil rural villages have to cope with

2853 2018-03-15 18:05:58 I'm just applying epimax junior and magnolia tissue oil at night babe. I want it to be smooth
2854 2018-03-15 18:05:57 Ha! Exactly. The snake oil salesmen win again.
2855 2018-03-15 18:05:43 Wow. You are the reason abortion should remain safe and legal.
2856 2018-03-15 18:05:30 If oil was the primary driver, then experts and environmental organisations would be telling us to use less soybean oil and opt for more alternatives. Yet they rarely do. The emphasis is typically on eating fewer animal products, even though this is a much bigger ask.
2857 2018-03-15 18:05:27 They should both be in jail.
2858 2018-03-15 18:05:24 The citrus sodas even contain brominated vegetable oil! "...memory loss, tremors, fatigue, loss of muscle coordination, headache, and ptosis..."

You know anything about energy drinks? I do not, but was thinking about learning.
2859 2018-03-15 18:05:22 I'm sure these young women will be crushed by what some creepy douchebag said about them on Twitter.
2860 2018-03-15 18:05:21 #bot 
2861 2018-03-15 18:05:15 Great so no need to build pipelines or subsidize oil.
2862 2018-03-15 18:05:13 Are you taking fish oil? High amounts of fish oil make you prone to bleeding.
2863 2018-03-15 18:05:07 Mine has done that a couple times I put coconut oil in before when it does
2864 2018-03-15 18:05:02 Is that empirically true, eg, world oil crises? And even still none of these systems are comparable to SAI. And even if they were and did evince supply can be maintained long term, they also show a dependency rel'nship on a monolithc system (except dykes?) which seems relevant
2865 2018-03-15 18:05:01 Midnight Oil doing the only Elvis very well
2866 2018-03-15 18:04:59 *getting an oil change*

Yeah your engine is missing, you want us to replace that?
2867 2018-03-15 18:04:46 What's the matter with you? Weirdo.

2871 2018-03-15 18:04:13 You want to talk about addictive drugs, I’m taking benzos twice a day in the hope they may control my epilepsy. If I could legally take an oil daily I may be able to come off such awful pills
2872 2018-03-15 18:04:11 It's just like when I used to work for Enterprise and Greenpeace Representatives would come through and rent vehicles.... they wanted the biggest SUVs possible... you know its canada and they gotta drive on dirt roads to protest the oil patch
2873 2018-03-15 18:04:11 The people changing my oil probably in that hoe smoking my blunt that’s what’s taking so long
2874 2018-03-15 18:04:07 しーさー
2875 2018-03-15 18:04:01 Do these contain any cutting agent? Or are they indeed pure C02 oil with only terpenes? I can't do MCT.
2876 2018-03-15 18:03:58 Adding to your conditioner makes more sense because you scrub your scalp with shampoo. Coconut oil repairs damaged hair, so you'd want to apply it to the length and ends, not your scalp where the hair is new and undamaged.
2877 2018-03-15 18:03:48 EV olive oil. Currently using @OroBailen

2880 2018-03-15 18:03:35 Looking options on crude oil Jun 2018 futures LOM8, it looks like crude oil could have a resistance level at $65. Potential drop down to $55 or even $50 if things align with OPEC.
2881 2018-03-15 18:03:30 I thought this hour wait for my oil change was going to suck but the waiting room has The Maury Show on lmao so it’s poppin at the Jeep dealership
2882 2018-03-15 18:03:14 Yikes-you have a mental disorder. Studies suggest pedophiles can’t be cured, but I did hear a podcast about a group of pedophiles who haven’t yet offended who seek therapy in an effort not to violate children. Maybe you should find one such group, if you haven’t already molested.
2883 2018-03-15 18:03:14 Despite signage indicating that the broth is simmered for 12 hrs, there was no indication of adequate fat used beyond the oil. It definitely tasted as if not enough bones were used or at all.
2884 2018-03-15 18:03:03 Their poor parents!
2885 2018-03-15 18:02:59 Get a spray bottle and mix water and a little bit of peppermint essential oil. Spray it all over. Spiders taste with their legs and they HATE it.
2886 2018-03-15 18:02:57 Yes, that is the snake oil he wants to put out on the counter. But I won't buy it!
2887 2018-03-15 18:02:55 I hate when guys say girls don't need makeup to be pretty. Makeup is a fun way for us to be creative, no one says y'all don't need beard oil and lines shaved on your head, you have your things, let us have ours
2888 2018-03-15 18:02:55 My dog takes CBD oil, now I know what he sees.

2890 2018-03-15 18:02:51 My favorite scent in the entire world: salt air with a hint of coconut tanning oil
2891 2018-03-15 18:02:47 £75k...that will really hurt them...they will learn their lesson..the oil money will take a real hit
2892 2018-03-15 18:02:40 But this is what the left does all the time. Tweek definitions so that they can demonize their opponents.
2893 2018-03-15 18:02:28 That body oil from @SheaMoisture is Gucci
2894 2018-03-15 18:02:25 Pouring oil on the fire is not the way to quench it.
2895 2018-03-15 18:02:20 What is your preferred oil for dressings?
2896 2018-03-15 18:02:14 ค่ะ ห้ามลืมนะ

2901 2018-03-15 18:01:28 Just at auto zone with the drug dealer guy pulling fresh new bills out of his socks to pay for the oil for his fancy bmw out front. We see you.  

*I would have taken a picture but I didn’t want to set him off.
2902 2018-03-15 18:01:23 The reason why our drillers are heading south is because nobody wants to invest in Alberta. We are business unfriendly. We have oil, we just have a hostile government, and no way to get that oil to the market. The NDP is not cleaning up a PC mess, they are making it worse.
2903 2018-03-15 18:00:57 OIL DIFF: 4.04 -> 4.04
2904 2018-03-15 18:00:53 Does he use coconut oil or soul glow to keep his hair so luscious and vibrant?

And no. I'm not a Democrat (or a big movie guy).
2906 2018-03-15 18:00:41 "Hotness Trajectory" for 8th graders? Trump would be so proud of you. And you folks talk about pizza parlor fantasies.
2907 2018-03-15 18:00:37 Those guys are a bunch of paid oil frauds. Y would I.
2908 2018-03-15 18:00:22 Well we all just seen through you as being lobbyists doing the bidding for foreign oil companies. You refuse to try and debate your science. You’ve got nothing but ad hominem attacks now.
2909 2018-03-15 18:00:12 So....Soviets protected Iranian oil during WWII from Third Reich.... Much deserved far as I'm concerned
2910 2018-03-15 18:00:11 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2911 2018-03-15 18:00:11 I'm disappointed. I was hoping to see Jessica Rabbit while I was here. I suppose I'll settle for Olive Oil. @Steele_AnaDK
2912 2018-03-15 18:00:11 Oil probably.

2918 2018-03-15 18:00:05 So point is.  I think they are aware and could be working on work-around.  Does that mean changing refining method, refining order, additives, etc.  I wouldn't know.  Are there other potential places to put this shale oil.  Any thoughts on future use/changes not stock builds.
2919 2018-03-15 17:59:50 7000 nukes, a thug in charge and a lot of oil and gas?

2922 2018-03-15 17:59:19 Albert has a lot of different oils including vast reserved of oil that does not come from oilseeds. The Bakken is a development very much like what is being produced in the US, with the same cost structures. I trade oil, so I keep myself informed.

2941 2018-03-15 17:58:17 Uncomfortable conversation on "sustainability" and oil production with Fort McKay First Nations and @Suncor's elephant-in-the-room COO at @GLOBE_Series . Reducing the GHG footprint of a barrel is so 2012. Can we talk about clean energy jobs instead? #ClimateAction

2951 2018-03-15 17:57:20 Oil is being brought into Eastern Canada by tanker from diverse places including, but not limited to the US. As for who is importing the oil, the consumer pays an extra $25 Billion dollars over what they would pay if they used Alberta Oil which they need to buy at world prices.

2965 2018-03-15 17:56:18 Yes straight on there. They have the organic coconut oil in the section where you buy the cooking oil. It works wonders. I told another friend of mine about it and it helped her daughter too. She had bad eczema too and couldn’t even wear jeans.
2966 2018-03-15 17:56:08 Nope. Not even a splash of oil.
2967 2018-03-15 17:56:08 Careful! According to skysports, pep created football! The last thing you need to do is have a pop at oil city, because nobody is allowed to say ANYTHING truthful about the chequebook fraud! Truth is, a title EARNED, is much better than a title BOUGHT!
2968 2018-03-15 17:55:58 funny how as soon as my dog started CBD oil for his cancer treatment he gained like 10 pounds hahahaha
2969 2018-03-15 17:55:52 Who are you still trying to convince ?? 
This is exactly like an INFOMERCIAL, 
just keep repeating the same Snake Oil Over and Over.
2970 2018-03-15 17:55:49 Disregard this. Lavender body oil should do the trick 
2971 2018-03-15 17:55:47 Michelle has done that, when in for an oil change, came out with a new car
2972 2018-03-15 17:55:38 More than the BIG OIL, it is the BIG HEALTHCARE that is more problematic....
2973 2018-03-15 17:55:34 If you were really science based then you would have no problem debating @FriendsOScience on the science. But you’re a fraud who wants to do the bidding of foreign oil companies and stop Canada from developing our resources & lowering the quality of life for Canadians.
2974 2018-03-15 17:55:29 I made out with this black guy and I smell like coconut oil. I feel delicious  I should get some tbh
2975 2018-03-15 17:55:24 Got the oil changed and now it’s time for a car wash!
2976 2018-03-15 17:55:07 يالله في ناس تدور شو عشان الجواهر والجماهيريه يمنشنو ابو كاتم من حسابهم الرسميه بعد ؟؟

2977 2018-03-15 17:55:00 Disgraceful BdB. Using a tragedy to push for more revenue cams. Speed cameras would not have saved these children. He’s like a used car salesman, a snake oil salesman. BdBs plan is about revenue. The IDCs plan is about revenue. Shameful!
2978 2018-03-15 17:54:54 Hey submissive go get me some Crisco oil,now take some of that oil lub up the 22'inch dildo and set ride it until I tell u to stop! That's my good boy!#call or GoddessBay@ext:890(415)765-0947

2979 2018-03-15 17:54:52 what? he they just burn oil none stop in Hollywood? he has an electric car and his house is low carbon out put as well. you're talking like those guys in big oil as a group of teachers or something they don't give a fuck
2980 2018-03-15 17:54:51 Got word an little while ago my oil bottles come in on Tuesday .. I am one happy girl
2981 2018-03-15 17:54:43 They creep out at night, mostly. Blue feathers matted back, slick with the oil from their nests. They're drawn to voices. They open their beaks, wider than an unhinged snake's. No one can hear you scream, for they carry the void within them. They swallow cries and stay hungry.
2982 2018-03-15 17:54:37 May the Lord be with you and help you as u acquire your oil blocks.
2983 2018-03-15 17:54:34 Need to get this oil change today
2984 2018-03-15 17:54:33 I just want to make love under candle light with some baby oil sip some wine  and blow off some steam  
2985 2018-03-15 17:54:30 I suppose we've now definitively entered the era of genetic snake oil salesmen. I wonder what they're doing with all that data they are collecting.
2986 2018-03-15 17:54:28 Ah era broma? ;)
2987 2018-03-15 17:54:19 no, I won't.
2988 2018-03-15 17:54:17 My appointment to get my car’s oil changed was at 12:30, I’m still waiting and it’s almost 2:00 
2989 2018-03-15 17:54:04 Check out the story of the oil barge in the St Lawrence that laid on the bottom for decades! Just do a search on google CBC archives for one! 42 million we had to litigate Irving to regain!
2990 2018-03-15 17:54:03 I’m no Chia fan but going on and on about the Hall trade is getting old. The trade was a huge factor in the Oil making the playoffs last year. This year is a disaster write off year. If next year is bad too then people can complain

2993 2018-03-15 17:53:32 Ooh! That works!
2994 2018-03-15 17:53:23 I’ll be 40 weeks next week. I need to get my casta oil ready,start taking long ass walks, & doing squats.
2995 2018-03-15 17:53:22 That’s why I cook at an arms distant when I’m using oil I done been burned too many times.
2996 2018-03-15 17:53:09 We are all busy recognizing that they are minors and we stayed focused on the message of their signs.  Is multi-tasking too complicated for you?
2997 2018-03-15 17:53:05 Hi Tim, it's hard to say honestly as it depends on a lot of individual factors of that service center and crew. However, if you've been waiting over an hour to have your oil change done, please let us know.
2998 2018-03-15 17:52:55 Don't see these as similar. Saying we need to keep oil in ground, say no to Enbridge, etc is not same as having concrete ideas of how we both 1. Take on the fossil fuel industry (ex: end subsidies), 2. Transition to 100% renewables in a just, pro-worker way (Ex: Green New Deal)
2999 2018-03-15 17:52:37 Moron, the “goods” you speak of are oil and timber requiring virtual no manpower or manufacturing.
3000 2018-03-15 17:52:07 Philip Seymour Hoffman woulda been perfect to play this turd after he snaps and Lifetime makes a movie.

But if he weren't already dead the weight gain required would have finished him anyway.
3001 2018-03-15 17:52:03 Yes! Both the Light and Ghost battery are compatible with cartridges. We sell a separate attachment for our Aurora called the "Aurora Magnet to 510 Thread Attachment" that allows for 510 threaded oil cartridges to be compatible with that battery as well.
3002 2018-03-15 17:52:00 ตามมาตั้งแต่รายการ win อ่ะค่ะ
3003 2018-03-15 17:51:57 We are staying at the holiday inn right by Lucas oil FRI & Sat :-) I’m stoked. Looks like the Kelly’s are in for sure also. Still working on some others
3004 2018-03-15 17:51:55 No. But straight coconut oil on the area?
3005 2018-03-15 17:51:55 Why is it that everytime you go for an oil change, they gotta find a million and one other things wrong 
3006 2018-03-15 17:51:34 هيثم يدور مشاهدات من ورا فهد يعع
3007 2018-03-15 17:51:34 Actually, I didn't make much money, that's why I am no longer doing that. DeBeers is now a marketing company so their workers are not in the mines anymore. As for the "value", no different than OPEC with oil...it makes certain people rich
3008 2018-03-15 17:51:33 Why is my mechanic trying to give me life advice? Please just change my oil.
3009 2018-03-15 17:51:26 Aye. Civil war is "war between factions within the same state".

So how come 50% of Syria is now occupied by the US (NE oil country), Turkey (NW) and Israel (SW).

Because Syrian dissent was stirred up from outside with one aim: Western hegemony.

Kurds now learning that.


3010 2018-03-15 17:51:25 Me, I simply do same for $200M Sir. That's the work we do. Na me even dash past owners of oil block....
3011 2018-03-15 17:51:16 Me: Is this a might or a tite?
Spelunker: Please don't touch that, the oil from your fingers...

3012 2018-03-15 17:51:07 Boy if you don't stfu I'm going t remove your oil drain plug while your working
3013 2018-03-15 17:50:50 Det er for mye oil igjen i Norol, mijønasjonen Norge kan ikke være bekjent med det.
3014 2018-03-15 17:50:43 But hav u ever thought why such cases increasing????     The answer is rampant adulterated fat in market, adulterated ghee, use of refined oil..... No checking in market by government.....

3018 2018-03-15 17:49:53 Have you tried coconut oil?
3019 2018-03-15 17:49:43 Ugly deliciousness at its best: tripe and veal liver in thick walnut and roasted sunflower seed oil sauce with pomegranate. Really good too.
3020 2018-03-15 17:49:41 They usually hold. You used oil or water? I personally don’t like the meatballs. I’ll eat them when I make spaghetti but only like 2/3.
3021 2018-03-15 17:49:40 They look just as ridiculous as the Westboro Baptist Church with those shitty signs.
3022 2018-03-15 17:49:36 Let me guess, you were a big Roy Moore fan, right?

3025 2018-03-15 17:49:28 Well the oil money and bye bye Fergie changed all of that...
3026 2018-03-15 17:49:24 Projection, why that's the #1 play in the liberal playbook.
3027 2018-03-15 17:49:19 I need some oil to get rid of these stretch marks. I've had them since like 13. They're like the family I avoid at cookouts, I know they here but ion acknowledge em in public.
3028 2018-03-15 17:49:19 Keep doing great works within the community.  #CBD Oil is a life saver for chronic pain and other ailments.  All natural healing... 
3029 2018-03-15 17:49:12 Awash in the corporate Everything Is Great And Only Getting Better ocean contrasting with the real life oil fire of Shit’s Fucked Up. You’d think one would ground out the other but no. Not hardly. #ThisYear
3030 2018-03-15 17:49:09 Is lemon water the new coconut oil? Asking for all white girls
3031 2018-03-15 17:49:05 okay, tea tree oil just doesn’t work for my skin and dries it out even more. Back to Lush
3032 2018-03-15 17:49:02 I have not - but would they make me break out? I already take off my makeup with an oil, and then cleanse with the cetaphil, so I don’t know what an oil-based cleanser would do following oil (also, idk what brands of those kind of cleanser there are)
3033 2018-03-15 17:48:45 Yeah I use the baby oil! But I’ll try the lotion thank you :)
3034 2018-03-15 17:48:44 lol I know Tunde would be down to make his last undergrad batch of Oil, lil neighbor, jellybean and nem could make their Nupe juice, Elonte and his chi'ren can make the Ape piss/Jungle Juice/Ice water or whatever, the Reds can make they Elephant Blood/Pyramid Punch and yea..letgo
3035 2018-03-15 17:48:40 ahh, so happy you enjoyed it, and the coconut oil too!

3037 2018-03-15 17:48:35 Why isn't Russia an international pariah? Oh yeah, they control much of Europe's oil supply. It's always fucking oil.

3046 2018-03-15 17:47:32 Nope. Conservatives are known to be very religious. Also, even if you don't believe in global warming, there's no doubt that we need to treat the earth better so the air and water stay clean. Conservatives care more about oil than renewable energy. Oil= money
3047 2018-03-15 17:47:27 I use coconut oil but it clogs my skin. And micellar water makes my skin burn :( but I use baby oil
3048 2018-03-15 17:47:23 If you are okay with all of that, and you think that Canadian dollars underwriting oppressive regimes s good, and that Albertans should get less for their oil they produce either way, and get large US companies to get that money instead, then by all means, support Notley.
3049 2018-03-15 17:47:20 I agree, however, there are many murderous dictators in the world who wouldn't be missed, The US and the UK seem to pick and choose according to oil, $$ and the end goal.

3052 2018-03-15 17:47:08 why does it need the High API crude? It probably vcan take some more bu there is a ceiling to how much it can take. The non-US refinery system already absorbed around 4mb of light/medium oil that was displaced when US started to take shale oil. Cannot go on forever.

3057 2018-03-15 17:46:46 C-5 Galaxy is US military. Canadian military has the C-17 Globemaster. It's big.  The BA-146 is a puny 4 engine jet.  The AN-124 is used to haul big stuff, often oil field equipment, to Alberta, so it could be that.
3058 2018-03-15 17:46:40 I got a pot of oil sitting on my stove rn as we speak
3059 2018-03-15 17:46:39 We need to drill where the oil exists. If it’s offshore then that’s where we drill. Energy independents is a must for national security. So drill baby drill.
3060 2018-03-15 17:46:22 Does bitumen react differently in cold turbulent water than oil?
3061 2018-03-15 17:46:21 อยุ่ด้วยกันนานๆใครก้เบือนะ.  แต่การทำยังใงให้ไม่เบือใหมคือวิธี. ไม่ใช่เบือก้คือเบือ
3062 2018-03-15 17:46:16 Ask your government to leave the 24% of Syrian territory where most gas and oil resources lie. How should a bankrupt country pay anything?
3063 2018-03-15 17:45:55 In addition, because we don't have a pipeline going east, the people in Eastern Canada have to spend an extra $25 Billion dollars to import oil at world prices, rather than buying cheaper Alberta Oil. In the meantime their money goes to oppressive and undemocratic regimes.
3064 2018-03-15 17:45:54 You’re an absolute fraud who can’t debate your claims and is part of the foreign oil funded machine to stop Canada from developing its resources.
3065 2018-03-15 17:45:50 All oil companies should have been doing this years ago, instead of spending billions fighting the reality of a changing world.

3067 2018-03-15 17:45:45 When I wanted to let them blow up something big, like Harry Dresden, I had the bad guys kidnap an NPC (threat) and go to an oil refinery in Wilmington (opportunity). Little else was needed. A PC summoned a firey Duke of Hell and blew the place to smithereens.
3068 2018-03-15 17:45:27 The likely cause of the row is Russia signing a deal with Saudi that will last decades controlling the price of oil. #bbcnews

3076 2018-03-15 17:44:50 Doc, you seem to be shaking a lot of tables today. You shook banking sector tables, oil sector tables, now you're shaking political parties tables. What's next?
3077 2018-03-15 17:44:36 You have a right to an opinion. There is no recession in the US oil industry. It's booming, and Albertans are being affected by not having access to tidal waters because we have to sell our oil at $20 below market price. The US gets all our profits. How does that help Albertans?

3104 2018-03-15 17:41:16 #MyLifeAsVickey is pretty cool. Did a photoshoot with a lingerie designer/ex-dominatrix and we instantly bonded over her Japanese culture. Also, I carpooled with our model, that I later had to run oil on her legs & butt. Thank God people like me.
3105 2018-03-15 17:41:04 @CatherineBizTV   Nittall should get out of His office and spend 4 or more months in overalls in the oil patch on both sides of our borders.  Will that sharpen him up  He lacks in depth due diligence
3106 2018-03-15 17:40:46 Maybe he does. Gotta watch during injury time to see if they have to oil it up
3107 2018-03-15 17:40:46 Fool. Russia will not go away.Its a nuclear superpower with vast reserves of oil & gas.
3108 2018-03-15 17:40:45 I purchased an attraction oil (which I love) and its interesting because the scent reminds me of my father. Specifically the incense that he used to burn at home.

3110 2018-03-15 17:40:32 Thanks to @ashleymitsue_ I now believe coconut oil and tea tree oil can fix any problem 
3111 2018-03-15 17:40:29 Kelly, I find zatar to be mostly tart and herbaceous. My grandmother mixed it with olive oil and pressed a layer into the top of flatbread before baking. Super delicious!
3112 2018-03-15 17:40:17 @DrJoeAbah please remember I am a loyal Protegè of yours o. Your way today ehn is scary. In one day we have seen JA crest, request on how to an Oil field, now on how to own commercial bank. All coming together small small....

3118 2018-03-15 17:39:36 Holy hebephilia! As the mother of a teen daughter, I feel like the govt should be legally required to notify me when men like you move into the neighborhood.
3119 2018-03-15 17:39:15 Exactly! Grew up in a midsize city west of Dallas. Most of my friends were only a generation or two off the ranch. Cattle and Oil.
3120 2018-03-15 17:39:15 Sweet potatoe wedges rubbed with oil/salt/pepper, in the oven for 40ish min (depends on temp, your oven, wedge size). Make a bell pepper or herb curd to go with it. You can buy (or make) herb curd or what I think works really well with sweet potatoes is a red bell pepper chopped

3123 2018-03-15 17:38:45 Adam, Acid doesn't release the oil from the rock. It creates channels from the wellbore that increase the area connected to the rocks natural permeability. It speeds up the rate at which oil can  be produced
3124 2018-03-15 17:38:45 What it takes to get an oil block:
1. Nigerian friends in very high places. 
2. Foreign friends in very high places. 
3. More dollars than you know what to do with. 
4. A lawyer who can watch your back. (This is me pitching for the job when you get the oil block).
3125 2018-03-15 17:38:44 However, Sinbad is playing Rel’s dad? Who’s the mama? Used engine oil?

3127 2018-03-15 17:38:26 Agreed.... if oil does happen the SWF is very important to get right but this all seems a bit petty!
3128 2018-03-15 17:38:25 Tea tree oil has helped me so much with my acne!!!!! thank you for your time
3129 2018-03-15 17:38:24 For the record: liberals don’t equate all gun owners with the KKK, many of us are LEGAL gun owners. What we do is identify anyone who opposes even the sanest, most sensible gun regulation as NRA extremists.
3130 2018-03-15 17:38:21 The only age of consent law that Gun Boy cares about is the lack of one for farm animals.
3131 2018-03-15 17:38:20 Why single out Russia? China, oil oligarchs, PRNK, Soros all aim to disrupt America (and tend to be more effective at it than Putin).
3132 2018-03-15 17:38:17 With all these Americans on the show recently does anyone else think there's Oil under the studio?  #gangofchase
3133 2018-03-15 17:38:09 Did you notice how fantastic your cell service was? a few years ago traveled along coast and was very impressed on the cell service that lined up with the oil platforms compared to the beaches where there were no oil platforms in sight.
3134 2018-03-15 17:38:04 Air traffic control. Education (via DeVos). Banks (via Congress). National Parks. Oil drilling on our shores = no defense against attack by sea.

3136 2018-03-15 17:37:52 Was suppose to get an oil change... went to the mall and bought clothes and got my eyebrows done.
3137 2018-03-15 17:37:51 Did you talk to the PM about reparations for having destroyed #Iraq, killed and injured hundreds of thousands of innocent people and driven 5 million from their home just so US could control the oil? Did you talk about how we are doing it all over again in #Yemen?
3138 2018-03-15 17:37:47 I'm not supporting anything, I'm pointing out lunacy.
3139 2018-03-15 17:37:37 You are a very flawed human being.  Take some time off from the internet and get some help.
3140 2018-03-15 17:37:37 <living bottle of olive oil
3141 2018-03-15 17:37:35 There is no 30% discount... there is only 30% less oil in bitumen due to DILUTION. The US pays more than it is worth.
3142 2018-03-15 17:37:26 Kids should stay away from you.
3143 2018-03-15 17:37:25 Oil and plastics the curse upon the 20th century that could have us all gone by the  22nd.
3144 2018-03-15 17:37:19 Walked to the shop to post a package AND to pick one up. Forgot to pick up. Walked back. Forgot to take ID with me. Remembered I had a pic of my driving licence with my face on it on my phone. Not good enough. So, 3rd walk. Anything for fish oil tablets  #MyADHD #MyLife #ADHD
3145 2018-03-15 17:37:17 maybe apply coconut oil to moisturize it
3146 2018-03-15 17:37:16 AS SOMEONE SAID WE NEED TO TOUCH THEM WHERE IT HURTS, IN THEIR OIL SUPPLY.
3147 2018-03-15 17:37:10 It's gonna sound weird, but my hair grew a lot faster when I used horse shampoo and once a week soaked it in canola oil. It's worth a shot. I ended up with 11 inches of hair over 6 months when I had previously only been able to grow up to 6 in a year before that. \__/

3152 2018-03-15 17:36:46 Nothing like colonisation of uninhabited islands before Argentina existed and the fact that the inhabitants want to be British not Argentinian.

Or that Argentina claim everything with oil underneath nearby. Just ask Chile

3156 2018-03-15 17:36:01 America fights for oil, or to stop Communism or some other stupid reason.  We prefer to live and let live.  We're not loud and obnoxious like Americans are.  We keep to ourselves and live our lives in peace.  All without having a gun in our bedside table.
3157 2018-03-15 17:35:57 I could literally moisturize my hands with the oil from my face 
3158 2018-03-15 17:35:52 8 not including the cash for crash Bengali family but including the woman holding the Theresa May stay away placard. Oh and the Marxist that didn't live there+ cannabis oil factory man
3159 2018-03-15 17:35:27 I believe it’s probably effecting the amount of investment on big oil , but you either believe you want to do something about it or you don’t and accept every natural disaster as the norm and pay trillions in repair , rebuild  of structures and infrastructure
3160 2018-03-15 17:35:24 I can almost smell the penetrating oil.
3161 2018-03-15 17:35:23 I'm cutting pipe at work, and these bees are legit drinking water mixed with oil. What the fuck dude lol
3162 2018-03-15 17:35:15 Yeah, right. @ACLU doesn't believe in the 2nd Amendment, and is pretty selective about the others...
3163 2018-03-15 17:35:12 There you are! Sorry Ace, I just wanted to share the comedy.
3164 2018-03-15 17:35:10 Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released Nigeria’s 2018 Article IV consultation report highlighting the country’s exit from the recession that started in the first quarter of 2016 largely due to low oil prices.
3165 2018-03-15 17:35:08 Ms. Campbell, why did you retweet such a shallow post? Is it to show the superficiality of the poster or to endorse judging people by their hotness? Where do you fit on the hotness scale? Does it inform your opinions?

3169 2018-03-15 17:34:58 I used coconut oil on my lashes to repair the damage mascara caused them and now I completely lost vision on my left eye

3171 2018-03-15 17:34:35 I am being incredibly picky... lol Also this is acting as a bit of a hedge for me. I wont be long oil for very long
3172 2018-03-15 17:34:30 Hemp cream !! I also got a knock off clarisonic like turning brushy thingy   and use it with soap AND TEA TREE OIL ( i have dry skin but break out easily )
3173 2018-03-15 17:34:24 No it says 2 marketable components.... squeeze out the oil then feed the meal
3174 2018-03-15 17:34:13 Funny how they don’t care about young men and women joining the military and being used as actual shields for big oil.
3175 2018-03-15 17:34:10 I read online that adding coconut oil to your shampoo will help damaged hair but now my scalp is burning
3176 2018-03-15 17:34:08 Please ask our Republican leaders a Question, without the supply of steel piping for the oil industry how will oil companies get the liquids out of the ground and transported to markets ???????@seanhannity
3177 2018-03-15 17:34:07 Arla er synonym for Snake oil ikke?

3179 2018-03-15 17:33:46 Oil is less than 1% of US electricity generation, it likely would not meaningfully increase even if the NJ nuclear power plants were shuttered.
3180 2018-03-15 17:33:36 SFO DOESNT GIVE A FUCK I HAVE WEED BUT THEYCARE I HAVE LOTION N COCONUT OIL IMA BE LATE FOR MY FLIGHT ASFUCK WTF
3181 2018-03-15 17:33:18 He is so  reckless and clueless to the point he thinks he can buy a nuclear program with his oil money.
3182 2018-03-15 17:33:15 Stick it in the microwave for 6 minutes then cover it in Olive oil and season. Then stick in the oven for 5 mins. 
3183 2018-03-15 17:33:13 Yes, and lots and lots of oil rigs, Old Crow.  Sigh.
3184 2018-03-15 17:33:10 Car wash. Oil change. Run. Put in a second pair of contacts. All things I did before my mom’s calling hours at funeral home.
3185 2018-03-15 17:33:09 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
3186 2018-03-15 17:33:01 It’s BECAUSE he’s real that they hate him. People are brainwashed to want the robotic polished snake oil lying while they’re smiling politicians. Thank God 65 million of us get it.

3191 2018-03-15 17:32:41 Specializes in oil and gas also specializes in portfolio management with over 10years experience in both. Can any God kind hearted person connect me with a job any were in the world. I will be very grateful.  I'm from Nigeria.
3192 2018-03-15 17:32:34 The real game changer for the US is energy independence! We need to pursue alternative energy sources with the vigor of the moon launch.  This alone would affect our national security and policies more so than any other! Mid East OIl is a quagmire, we need to get out of it!
3193 2018-03-15 17:32:28 Wow, you found their line in the sand
3194 2018-03-15 17:32:25 I too am not sexually attracted to these underage kids
3195 2018-03-15 17:32:25 Treating my car today. Car wash and oil change. Finally I can afford it
3196 2018-03-15 17:32:21 Only reason is back to 2015 was that there is only data for the api of the US crude oil production back to 2015.

3199 2018-03-15 17:32:10 @SsssamanthaaMUA are you still using the ufo oil? Is so, is it worth it especially for someone who has dry/acne prone skin?
3200 2018-03-15 17:32:10 My voice from the bathroom: This oil bath is going to feel so good...

Wife: Haha, C-3PO from Star Wars?

Me: Uh...yup! *sound of door locking and a sixty empty bottles getting knocked over*

3202 2018-03-15 17:32:07 I don't think you read that correctly. It says that soybeans are turned into either soybean meal or soybean oil. 

98% of the soybean meal is used by farmed animals, while 2% of the soybean meal is used as human food. 

And then there's the soybean oil, which humans use 100% of.

3208 2018-03-15 17:31:41 You quoted instead of replying. A person might get the idea that you're trying to slip away quietly.

3210 2018-03-15 17:31:37 I find them fascinating, watching how tough some jobs can be, it's humbling, especially Black Gold, oil mining in 110° is rough.

3217 2018-03-15 17:31:09 Yes, I know who freaking Ortega is.

No, Democratic Socialism is just socialism, but elected. It doesn't imply a mixture of anything.

Venezuela, however, is heavily socialist (what does oil have to do with socialism?).

I'm not even sure why I'm arguing with your ilk.
3218 2018-03-15 17:31:04 "Holland-Strauss" I CAN SMELL THE FUCKING OIL FROM HERE
3219 2018-03-15 17:31:00 As for the second-largest category of goods imported from Canada? That'd be natural gas and oil. No large  manufacturing upside there for American workers if that flow were reversed.
3220 2018-03-15 17:30:54 Nope, past deaths have been brushed under the rug as "suicides" or "unconfirmed". IMO the difference is that dropping oil prices mean less Russian $$$ for the UK so less reason to overlook now.

3223 2018-03-15 17:30:37 Shitty investment decision iv been stuck in since 2016. Could have been a incredible long oil/gas play but Enervest  cucked out with no warning and solid assets to debt and financials. But hey, patent gets a nice tax write off and assets on the cheap.

3228 2018-03-15 17:29:49 THERE IS NO PROOF AT ALL, THEY BROUGHT DOWN GADDAFI AND SADDAM HUSSEIN, THEY WANT SYRIAN OIL TOO..
3229 2018-03-15 17:29:20 Rip to the Ford Fusion we drove without oil
3230 2018-03-15 17:29:07 About time! I used to run a forklift for an LTL, and thought that the VERY LEAST we could do is electrify the hostler trucks on-site. This is what we need- Less dependence on oil= Less corrupt oil funds pouring into enemy hands. Thanks, @elonmusk !
3231 2018-03-15 17:29:06 You lost the debate when you have to bring "mom" into it.

You really are a weakling.
3232 2018-03-15 17:28:54 Oh, I’m going through tons of flower and cannacoconut oil, for sure.  Just thinking I’ll need something a little bit stronger in reserve 
3233 2018-03-15 17:28:36 I wish somebody take my car to get an oil change
3234 2018-03-15 17:28:35 My husband still bristles about the oil bust years and the NEP, but I remind him that early 80’s recession happened everywhere and not just in Alberta. 

But NEP 2.0 is a myth.
3235 2018-03-15 17:28:34 indiana’s about to allow CBD oil??? i’m shook.
3236 2018-03-15 17:28:22 1. Buy Dangote cement, mix with sand + water to mould blocks. Now you have the block
2. Get oil; you can either get palm oil, groundnut oil or olive oil
3. Pour your must preferred oil into the block
4. Now you have an oil block
Congratulations! 
OR use faith, like Mrs Alakija
3237 2018-03-15 17:28:20 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
3238 2018-03-15 17:28:09 No you understood me because I do articulate english language in a better way. Will try be more slangish .. maybe it is easier on u. Again listen Air Balloon :) in an Oil Aquarium and a metallic ball. Why  you want to mention Air . I am clear.
3239 2018-03-15 17:27:57 Nor does it have to comply with gender equality components like Canadian Projects.... Imagine making Saudi Oil be compliant to that or PM even bringing it up?
3240 2018-03-15 17:27:56 There's this HBO documentary about Andre the Giant, and Hollywood Hulk Hogan is on there saying what a great guy Andre was, as if he didn't get his oil checked by the biggest thumb in wrestling history.
3241 2018-03-15 17:27:53 But in 2015 oil was on its way down to $23 in Jan. '16, from $100 in early 2014, and oil/gas profits plummeted. Not so much in 2017 with oil up about 10% for the year.
3242 2018-03-15 17:27:41 getting rid of opponents is certainly a gain.

I don't think the Russians are particularly scared , they have Europe by the balls via oil and gas, while the US is too deep in its own internal mess in order to really do much about it.
3243 2018-03-15 17:27:36 Oil is going to prove one big headache for Guyana, I predict!
3244 2018-03-15 17:27:31 Ah man hope you get back to normal soon . lots of rest , no excitement defo the steroids, If you have eucalyptus oil add to a burner, milk with honey and a spoonfull of garlic every night also helps me.
3245 2018-03-15 17:27:30 Take solace in being a pedophile, Will, thats what you are.
3246 2018-03-15 17:27:29 Sesame oil + salt + pepper + meat + oregano* = heaven
3247 2018-03-15 17:27:27 Broccoli tastes amazing if you sauté it in unrefined coconut oil
3248 2018-03-15 17:27:24 TEA TREE, frankincense, lavender oil. :) or we have an oil called Owie for kids that’s supposed to help the appearance of skin for cuts etc so idk if that would help scars haha
3249 2018-03-15 17:27:18  so cute! Good doggie!
3250 2018-03-15 17:27:09 Leak rates have to be very low for gas to be better than oil in transportation.
3251 2018-03-15 17:27:05 None of that is true about you btw
3252 2018-03-15 17:27:03 Oh my god no girl i could’ve saved you coconut oil clogs your pores so bad
3253 2018-03-15 17:26:56 1. You can't know that from this age; 2. That shouldn't have crossed your mind at this age; 3. "Hotness" is irrelevant. Nice try.

3257 2018-03-15 17:26:41 The hiring and firing is all about the oil industry he was only in there long enough to get what they wanted when are you people going to wake up
3258 2018-03-15 17:26:25 Thanks for the share, love coconut oil, drink in hot chocolate, use on hair and face, on toast etc. wonderful!
3259 2018-03-15 17:26:24 I heard it’s almost impossible for Trumpers to get a date nowadays. It’s so bad they had to start their own dating site. It’s called “Ok, Stupid.” Hope that helps.
3260 2018-03-15 17:26:20 Oh my lord this one even breaks it down for you and you still ignore it  thanks for proving me right again tho....  oil and meal 88+12 = 100% oil for human use then only 98% of the leftover meal for animal feed

3265 2018-03-15 17:25:59 Hi Krissy. We've checked with our QA team, rapeseed oil is extracted from the seeds of the rape plant. It is actually one of the largest sources of vegetable oil in the world.
3266 2018-03-15 17:25:49 Have heard cannabis oil works for epilepsy ,do you agree ?@NJLahori
3267 2018-03-15 17:25:28 First proposed in 1952 so maybe after it opens have a review on who sat on their hands and subjected Aberdeen to a 3rd rate road system as the Oil Capital!!!!
3268 2018-03-15 17:25:13 Oh sorry again.. Can't help you . I told u this is old science.. Can u please show me the same calcs for an environment filled of Oil. Like if I have a metallic ball &and air buble.. what is the acceleration of these two objects to reach stillness?. U know things go down & up
3269 2018-03-15 17:25:10 La foto en la parrilla de la entrada y los guantes en La oil cuando los vi casi me muero sabes lo que es tener unos guantes firmados por @GUILLEORTELLI lo massss

3271 2018-03-15 17:25:07 It's definitely better than oil on probably every metric. And there's a lot of coal left.
3272 2018-03-15 17:24:59 You're an adult man bullying children. That's beyond cowardly. Congratulations for being a crappy cartoon villain.
3273 2018-03-15 17:24:56 Coconut oil and brown sugar is the nicest lips exfoliator I’ve tried kaman
3274 2018-03-15 17:24:55 And we would risk going blind and deaf listening to Phil Mudd behave like an infant. My 2 1/2 year old grandson has a better demeanor and higher intelligence than this unhinged piece of garbage. He sounds like his brain consists of used motor oil.
3275 2018-03-15 17:24:53 As long as the safe space doesn’t have pedophiles like @Oil_Guns_Merica in it, then yes. I will go to the safe space.

3277 2018-03-15 17:24:33 Alberta needed some economic stimulous for the decline in oil prices. Notley could argue this and spend wisely but often doesn't. Harper spent on things like infrastructure.
3278 2018-03-15 17:24:33 Suggest CBT oil. That stops Parkinson to my knowledge.  Best wishes to a great guitarist and dude!
3279 2018-03-15 17:24:26 It's a show everyone. 
He's delusional and a appearance is better than facts in his mind. He's interviewing con men, snake oil salesmen.
The Kudlow cocaine addict will of course predict 7% growth. Surprised he's not predicting 10%, 15, 20!
3280 2018-03-15 17:24:16 I accept your concession.

You are very bad at this, but what would we expect from Will the Pedophile?
3281 2018-03-15 17:24:11 Yes. Do you mean filling a balloon with oil while submerged in oil? Oil is denser, so the weight will be greater, but the same calculations still work.
3282 2018-03-15 17:24:06 1. 6 or 9 inches block?
2. What type of oil? Olive,coconut, palm, cotton seed. 
3. What quantity of both items do you want?
3283 2018-03-15 17:24:02 I just witnesed 2 girls talk about how they don’t like Mexicans because their skin look tone looks “impure” and then proceed to put on oil and sit in the sun to get darker. I will never understand Americans
3284 2018-03-15 17:23:42 My Patna just gave me a CBD oil pen top for the freeski for advertising purposes.
3285 2018-03-15 17:23:33 The only ones not standing up now and saying they agree are people in denial, saudi arabia owns nearly our entire country, they are this exact sect, they own the richest oil company, we have been sold out i think i hope it's not the truth but i'm rarely wrong in my gut
3286 2018-03-15 17:23:29 Oh yessss my fav @MissClareR1 any chance of a #OilSection tonight would love to call and get oil all over Clare  #OilFans
3287 2018-03-15 17:23:21 Be Strong!
3288 2018-03-15 17:23:14 Came for an oil change and I just might be trading my car in
3289 2018-03-15 17:23:06 It does help when it displaces coal, possibly oil. It hurts when it displaces nuclear. It should be replaced by zero carbon, including EE, whenever possible without increasing coal.
3290 2018-03-15 17:23:00 k
3291 2018-03-15 17:22:58 Thinking about it some more, I suspect LAB uses some form of water soluble ink for the color coating in their universal pin kits, which is why the older ones bleed into the trays. The newer ones might use an oil base instead. I dunno, I am not very good at chemistry.
3292 2018-03-15 17:22:56 put vitamin e oil after you wash your hair!
3293 2018-03-15 17:22:47 @carnegiefuels Thanks for the excellent service today! We ran out of oil and got a same day delivery, just before the cold spell  #Thanks #BeastfromEast
3294 2018-03-15 17:22:42 A new trailer isn’t needed. Stop drilling you’ve hit oil.
3295 2018-03-15 17:22:42 GOOD!!! IF this is TRUE, then they "meddled" for the right reason for a change! I'll bet what *you* call "misinformation" is actually the TRUTH! We don't NEED no stinkin' oil shale!!

3306 2018-03-15 17:21:22 You're naive if you believe Nigeria is one because we love each other so much. Oil has always been the glue.
Watch this video.
3307 2018-03-15 17:21:14 I did sit under the dryer at the shop  ok I’m going to buy it and compare it to the miss. Jessie’s stuff I have been using. The stylist also wants me to stay away from oils for my hair so it’s gonna be annoying to find reasonably prices products that are oil free
3308 2018-03-15 17:21:13 500 traffic fatalities recorded in NYC in 1995, NYPD reduced that number to 245 by 2011 Before BdB and Cameras and they continue to reduce fatalities. BdB is a snake oil salesman, a used car salesman. Using a tragedy to sell more cams, more revenue. Disgraceful!

3312 2018-03-15 17:21:00 me and this lady walked into honda at the same time and we both had oil changes at 1:00 and both our last names were rodriguez
3313 2018-03-15 17:20:51 Nope already said we should only use Palastinian oil and gas products.
3314 2018-03-15 17:20:36 Motor oil isn’t bad. Especially if you’re an android. Wait...
3315 2018-03-15 17:20:20 Oil changes shouldn’t be 700$ lol
3316 2018-03-15 17:20:18 In the wake of America's greatness in the death of Steven the world, all the Arabs and the oil countries say that he is an atheist who has no mercy from us if his deeds in this world were good, but in the hereafter bad because he could not see God and failed in that they themselv
3317 2018-03-15 17:20:18 Thanks for acknowledging you are a coward.

I would wipe the floor with you.

Leave the teen girls alone, perv.
3318 2018-03-15 17:20:15 He/she has me blocked. Little ol’ me! Can you believe it?
3319 2018-03-15 17:20:14 You brought up his "frustration", and are chiding me about "emotions"? Lol
3320 2018-03-15 17:19:47 Why do the pro oil people always try to justify and sell oil spills by what Victoria has done with sewage... as has every municipality in Canada with modernization?
3321 2018-03-15 17:19:47 There has to be some sort of scandal going on with the use of cannabis oil for medical uses! No believing no-ones thought of it before now.
3322 2018-03-15 17:19:43 Or a better test that can tell when you smoked. Now it can show up days later (or longer). I may try the supposed THC free CBD oil anyway. It's worth a try!
3323 2018-03-15 17:19:43 Kudlow is not “serving” us in Gov. He is an “economic” snake oil salesman screw the people over by pushing said snake oil for the benefit of the 1%. So I don’t care if he is the sweetest person on the planet on an interpesonel level.
3324 2018-03-15 17:19:28 I would ask you to step outside yourself for a moment and look at this tweet. Really look at it like a sane person looks at it, and tell me you aren't a parody.

I would ask, but you're obviously a lunatic and not capable.

My sides are in fucking orbit, here, though. Good job.

How much did your family make from the mass-murder in Iraq?

3332 2018-03-15 17:18:43 I feel this challenge revolves a lot around the problems of boom and bust. People weren't going into the trades to make a long-term career choice. They went in for $$$, and once the bust hit, they left the industry. We need tradespeople, and not just when oil is paying.

3340 2018-03-15 17:17:57 If a person has 2 jobs only reports the income of one of those jobs to the IRS, do you think that person has accurately described his income? Also, when he tells this story he says that the number that Justin gives him didn't include lumber and oil. That part is a total lie too.

3347 2018-03-15 17:17:14 All oil gas and quarrying are only 9% of our GDP and 14% of exports. Canada is already prosperous at that level. We are the 10th largest GHG emitter in the world. USA is the largest. We are responsible for us, not for them.
3348 2018-03-15 17:17:13 plastic in the oceans, #ClimateChange, warming oceans, tanker traffic, oil pollution, pollution runoff from land systems, etc. added together... disaster.
3349 2018-03-15 17:17:05 Hard to tell if the vitamins help. My wife thinks the CBD oil is helping one dog, the other not as responsive. Hard to know. It has helped me with arthritis
3350 2018-03-15 17:17:03 Venezuela isn't socialist actually.
It's mostly privatized and relies heavily on oil.
Nicaragua on the other hand, uses Democratic Socialism.
Which is a mixture of socialism and capitalism.
The president, Daniel Ortega, is part of the Sandinista National Liberation Front...

3374 2018-03-15 17:15:14 so for some reason a plug in difuser I've had on the table has been leaking so now I got a puddle of essential oil that could possibly burn me and I'm just looking at it like

3388 2018-03-15 17:13:36 I am addicted to watching videos of people ruining their hair with bleach. Or salons ruining their hair with bleach.

One huge trend is coconut oil. Who told literally all these people that coconut oil 'protects' your hair from bleach??
3389 2018-03-15 17:13:35 What a beautiful place! It's a shame oil is more important than the heath of humans and earth.
3390 2018-03-15 17:13:13 I’m talking bout free chic-fi-la and oil change from the dealer big bra 
3391 2018-03-15 17:13:04 I gotta change the oil in the car tomorrow morning, maybe I'll go watch Tomb Raider afterwards.
3392 2018-03-15 17:12:58 You are unfit to serve. Stop raping public lands, approving trophy hunting, destroying our parks - all for your personal benefit and for your corrupt oil buddies. #firezinke #gopcorruption #TrophyHunting #PublicProtector #zinkeinthehouse
3393 2018-03-15 17:12:55 “And don’t get it twisted, sis, I wake up every morning next to a head scarf and coconut oil. I’m married to a black queen.”
3394 2018-03-15 17:12:52 Unless Pitt secretly owns an oil pipeline, there’s no way they would pay another buyout after paying $6-9 million to KS and potentially the buyout of the sitting coach they hire. 

Plus both fan and leadership will be much more patient on the heels of 0-19.
3395 2018-03-15 17:12:46 Attending the FIRST EVER meeting of the #Ohio Oil and Gas Leasing Commission. Finally.
3396 2018-03-15 17:12:42 Lol.,yeah, remember when Democrats gave the richest people in the country a trillion in tax cuts and opened federal land to oil drilling

Or when Obama settled a fraud lawsuit while in office for $35 million for a fake school 

Or when Obama's NSA was working for Turkey.
3397 2018-03-15 17:12:40 Because I have nothing else to do but contemplate despair on oil, ink, or graphite, I should probably read on India's history.
3398 2018-03-15 17:12:39 Oil! I wrote one of the those!

3405 2018-03-15 17:11:48 I’m not a professionnal portrait artist but I would love to make a portrait of you. Actually I made one 3 years ago (an oil painting) but I would like to do a drawing this time what do u think?
3406 2018-03-15 17:11:45 You on the other hand are way past the point of being a complete piece of garbage. Congratulations.
3407 2018-03-15 17:11:43 I need a fresh oil change.. and ima buy a new timing belt..
3408 2018-03-15 17:11:39 "opals should never be kept in oil" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAA
3409 2018-03-15 17:11:32 WOW, WOW, WOW!  That's a terrific plan.  Here in upstate NY we could use wind power.  I want to join a larger group of homeowners to share costs and benefits..Using oil  is ruining our quality of life!
3410 2018-03-15 17:11:30 You are a horrible excuse for a human being. Wow...
3411 2018-03-15 17:11:11 i don’t want to go get my oil changed by myself :(
3412 2018-03-15 17:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: chewy crust with chunky coconut oil and pepperoni.
3413 2018-03-15 17:11:07 They're children.
3414 2018-03-15 17:11:04 It would be totally ok to carbon Tariff all imported oil for up stream and down stream uses.
3415 2018-03-15 17:10:58 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
3416 2018-03-15 17:10:46 Because a decade of neglect by the Conservative Federal govt didn't help.. There was no federal investment in the East with Harper.  It was all about oil, while manufacturing died in East, THAT hurt the company I worked for, they almost, and I did go bankrupt.
3417 2018-03-15 17:10:44 TRUMP is also known for rubbing people too young for him the wrong way. Like supports like. 
Voting a rapist like TRUMP in was a bad move.
3418 2018-03-15 17:10:39 It's also major money for Alberta and Canada.  If we don't produce oil then others will? How does that help the environment?
3419 2018-03-15 17:10:39 I used bacon as a base but start by sautéing thinly sliced leeks in like olive oil and add a dash of soy sauce. Add in chopped garlic and thinly sliced cabbage and give it a stir. Add a lil water, lower heat and let everything cook. Finish with rice wine vin. :-)

3426 2018-03-15 17:09:58 Oil, convertida en una caja para financiar gastos de López y de su socio Fabián De Sousa, también detenido. Ricardo Roa. Clarín.
3427 2018-03-15 17:09:42 Calculations are math, you can do them correct and reach to the same results in multiple different ways even by observations . I simply meant.. it is good to explain what are the numbers you are using. Can you please do the same calcs in a only oil environment 
3428 2018-03-15 17:09:34 .@phlakin has kicked off community rally for teachers and to encourage legislators to “burn the midnight oil” to address state education needs.
3429 2018-03-15 17:09:27 Im afraid the squeaky door gets the oil and farming is easy when your " field is a desk and your ploughshare a pen " (Eisenhower)
3430 2018-03-15 17:09:25 Negotiation. That’s what this is about.  Union high balled, legs certainly low balled.  T’s see the golden goose being saved again. Big oil needs to pay their fair share.  Or it seems the animosity will grow.
3431 2018-03-15 17:09:24 Compare Norway and the UK. Both mined the same North Sea oil patch. 
Norway taxed heavily and banked it. The UK cut taxes. 
Now Norway's debt is 37% of GDP & UK is 90%. 
The WHO ranks Norway's health care 11th and the UK's 18th.
Which worked better for citizens?

3439 2018-03-15 17:08:40 Honestly.. we are slow to radicalize, but it's awesome to see weve got there now. Teacher walkouts are good, but conditions have gone from "super fucking not okay" to "are teachers receiving paychecks even?" As a result of how fucked up Oklahoma oil subsidies are, so it's now..
3440 2018-03-15 17:08:34 All that's a shame, it really is, but if it weren't for oil we wouldn't be in the middle east. 

They've been fighting each other for 2000 years, and I suspect they'll be fighting each other for another 2000. It wasn't our fight, they don't even want us there.
3441 2018-03-15 17:08:25 @marketcall   can your guest comment on Athabasca Oil.  Is this a good entry point to hold or trade?

3446 2018-03-15 17:07:44 I'd say they don't give a shit! We've been waiting for 12 days, had no oil for 4 days...told us it was coming today - this morning told me it would be here by 5pm...it's not here and I've been waiting for them to answer phone for 21 minutes!
3447 2018-03-15 17:07:42 Of course the low oil pressure light would come on right now, and we’re hitting traffic... #getustoct

It’s just bean dip with seasoning.

Mmm, garlic.
Pass the hummus please.

3460 2018-03-15 17:06:40 Let me get to my car so I can go get a hair cut and a oil change
3461 2018-03-15 17:06:35 I understand we need to shift away from oil but it seems we (Canadians)are shooting ourselves in the foot economically too much to appease the special interest groups .
3462 2018-03-15 17:06:28 "In March 2003, Kellogg Brown & Root, Halliburton's construction and engineering subsidiary, received from the Pentagon what is called a sole-source contract, meaning it was awarded without bidding, to restore and operate Iraqi oil wells."
3463 2018-03-15 17:06:27 López está procesado y en prisión por esa estafa. Para no pagar la deuda o para pagar la deuda con una quita y en comodísimas 96 cuotas, pidió el concurso de Oil que fue rechazado por fraudulento por un juez y que una cámara sorprendentemente habilitó. Ricardo Roa. Clarín
3464 2018-03-15 17:06:19 Rex Tillerson sacrificed his job b/c of greed for #zoo niGEria #crude oil money. Shame on him. Thank you President Trump.

3470 2018-03-15 17:05:30 I’ve been using a paste (it’s mixed with coconut oil I think) so it’s not messy at all which I like a lot!

3479 2018-03-15 17:04:32 Well I’m not interested in it to get high, just for the benefits on the body. Like the healing and pain relief, and anxiety/depression relief. I’m just wondering if since I smoke a lot of weed if I would need a CBD oil with a higher dosage in case my body is tolerant to CBD.
3480 2018-03-15 17:04:22 Parecía que con Cristóbal López estaba todo dicho. Pero no. Sigue sumando sorpresas: se ha descubierto una trama de pagos millonarios a abogados y famosos de la política con plata de la empresa Oil. Ricardo Roa. Clarín

3486 2018-03-15 17:03:34 Everyone should be supporting native tribes in the U.S. and Canada that are on the front lines of fighting big oil and their pipelines.  The oil industry has been destroying their lands first before others and now they are fighting back to reclaim clean land and water!

3529 2018-03-15 16:59:40 What the hell you don't get a free reach-around with your insurance?!  What is the world coming too??  I hope, at least you got your oil checked?!  ;)
3530 2018-03-15 16:59:38 So, there's a chance I can fix the Miata for $20. The previous owner might have put the wrong gear oil in the trans, and that's what causes the same fuckin noise. I'm gonna change the fluid, wish me luck y'all. Let's hope it's not the clutch!
3531 2018-03-15 16:59:34 Always get turned on when watching you use oil! 
3532 2018-03-15 16:59:32 Obama did nothing

to stop Russia Obama paid Iran to stay in business
Obama wanted America to lose strength not be#1 lead from behind remember
Obama gave Alaska oil to Russia by not letting us directional drill so Russia took it

3545 2018-03-15 16:57:52 Oh what fun!! I have sum " real" wood that I get to oil occasionally! The other stuff I polish too!

3547 2018-03-15 16:57:47 Thank you, I’m a nurse that was involved in a very traumatic accident 1 1/2 years ago.  I use hemp oil &?it has been a miracle for me.  Hopefully will see the benefit soon
3548 2018-03-15 16:57:47 Boiled carrots  with a small amount of butter, coconut sugar and Siracha is my new favourite thing! Could swap the butter for coconut oil or vegan butter to make it a little healthier...

3554 2018-03-15 16:57:17 I put it on the fan page I admin for too.  I thought it was liquor in the background until someone pointed out it was olive oil....yeah post corrected. But I wasn't the only one who thought that.... Lol
3555 2018-03-15 16:57:07 Those oil tankers bringing oil to the east coast burn from [depending on their size] 12,000 to 37,000 thousand litres of oil per hour. A pipeline to the east coast would spare us from tons of carbon.
3556 2018-03-15 16:57:06 i use aloe or vitamin e oil/shea butter mixed
3557 2018-03-15 16:57:03 I don't think you understand how this works.
3558 2018-03-15 16:56:55 you mean the deal that GW Bush wrecked by stopping fuel oil deliveries and putting North Korea on an 'axis of evil'? your efforts -- and those of your 'echo chamber' will push Iran to develop nukes in the same way.
3559 2018-03-15 16:56:32 Yes we all know you tried your hardest over regulating the process to get it canceled as was with Energy East. Why do you not do the same for imported oil?
3560 2018-03-15 16:56:32 موفقين 
3561 2018-03-15 16:56:28 When I was in high school, I convinced my friend that fish oil made your wang bigger. Not sure if it worked, but his skin was glowing.
3562 2018-03-15 16:56:13 And yet, you cant answer these basic questions 
1. How do you clean up dilbit in the ocean?
2. How much would it cost us to clean up an oil tanker spill?
3. Who would pay for clean up?
3563 2018-03-15 16:56:12 I think next time I might substitute either peppermint or orange oil for the vanilla, too.
3564 2018-03-15 16:55:36 Today the American Petroleum Institute, the main lobbying arm of the oil industry, is holding a 200 person conference at Trump's DC hotel right before they meet with Trump himself. Your kleptocracy at work!

3580 2018-03-15 16:54:11 oil painting will actually be the death of me
3581 2018-03-15 16:54:09 Also his work clothes smell like grease and oil and is making my washer stink even more.
3582 2018-03-15 16:54:05 Weigh out six grams of olive oil and allow to simmer.
3583 2018-03-15 16:54:04 but you support 759 000 tons Saudi oil coming in everyday. You make a lot of sense as a Saudi oil lover

3593 2018-03-15 16:53:15 It’s the bread, the pizza is full of oil (basically fat) which slows absorption  of the carbs into our body. I’m fine with pizza tbh
3594 2018-03-15 16:53:13 No worse than ur “experiencing trauma gives one license to malign and insult people free of backlash” point.
3595 2018-03-15 16:53:09 I'm not sure what your point is but I'm quite clearly implying that you want to diddle the pubescent girls in that photo.
3596 2018-03-15 16:53:09 Rockefeller,  centalized oil in America and he sold it for the "Cheapest price"; No one could outproduce nor outsell him...he had the Lowest prices, which was a boon for the poor/common man. Folks like Jihan may be a Blessing in disguise...better Jihan than some Central Banker!!
3597 2018-03-15 16:53:01 Waiting on my oil change and this girl walks in wearing water shoes WITH socks. Her shoes say I love Jamaica. She’s complaining about the dusty chairs in the waiting room. Should I complain about her fashion monstrosities?
3598 2018-03-15 16:52:54 Really raising the bar there, aren't ya sport?
3599 2018-03-15 16:52:53 I've done that, though it was hard getting the right amount of oil. I could do with some new things to cook but its hard pleasing everyone.
3600 2018-03-15 16:52:52 Yeah right he almost dropped his in an oil pan this week and then loses one in the cow pasture

3603 2018-03-15 16:52:44 any analysis on "WHY" Trump Org was not able to remove russian sanctions? seemed like their goal a year ago. with Exxon leaving partnership w Russia oil platform-seems like this is turning against Russia-will Trump try again? what were the guard rails that kept them in check?
3604 2018-03-15 16:52:43 I used to think that your chips were amazing, but recently they've gone a bit shitty, the taste is off and it retains too much oil.  You really need to improve your recipe.

3622 2018-03-15 16:50:49 meh, at this point I'm happy that the 'mericans poison their soil in order to become the largest oil producer. At least that decreases the dependency on lunatic theocratic middle eastern states.
Also, can't spell soil without oil.
3623 2018-03-15 16:50:30 I get people needing emergency repairs, but 1.5 hours for a scheduled appt for an oil change still seems bad.

You keep saying "bye", but keep coming back.
3633 2018-03-15 16:49:20 So you're going to put a tariff on Canadian lumber and Canadian oil imports? That will only make the cost of new USA houses more expensive, plus raise the prices on American manufactured products using steel and aluminum on things exported to Canada (or anywhere else). Not good!!
3634 2018-03-15 16:49:12 Anytime you have the feeling again, just go and drink anointing oil. Because it's your village people trying to do soft work with your destiny.
3635 2018-03-15 16:49:10 The same people telling me that Vladimir Putin is the anti-christ and that Russia go around murdering spies in broad daylight are the same people who told me that Scotland's oil was running out and that the EU wouldn't want us.
3636 2018-03-15 16:49:07 More honorable mentions for #MailboxMadness... "Well, we're deep into something."  "Bears don't care what we wear" "He was pointing to Idaho" "I try not to buy tuna from the same place I buy motor oil" "If she doesn't want him, I'll take him."  #POstables 
3637 2018-03-15 16:49:04 Putin's support in Russia comes from the belief the population has that the US and NATO are trying to surround Russia to control/invade it. The issue is that it is true, lol. Not defending Putin at all. But US aggression gives Putin the political ammo to consolidate his power.

3654 2018-03-15 16:47:38 Statistic from a talk I'm listening to:

To meet 450 ppm concentration of atmospheric CO2, every person has about 25-30 tons of carbon left to emit. 

That's roughly a tanker truck of oil for every person. Next time you're at the airport, you can see your allowance.

3673 2018-03-15 16:45:14 Nooo I haven’t but I’ve heard the peppermint oil that you can rub on your skin is like $100 
3674 2018-03-15 16:45:02 of course all if this ignores the product. AB oil produced TODAY, when burned, accoints for over 1 megatonne of CO2 emissions each day. every day...

this is climate leadership?

even if emissions from the oil sands were to actually drop this is all #greenwashing.
3675 2018-03-15 16:45:01 Our climate plan and Alberta’s hard cap on oil sands emissions levels takes into account the upstream emissions associated with the TransMountain expansion. The TransMountain expansion project does not stand in the way of meeting Canada’s commitments to the #ParisAgreement #GVBOT
3676 2018-03-15 16:44:52 Would you care to explain why you, an adult man, is gauging the hotness of underaged teen girls?  Also, are their opinions less valid if a pervy old creeper doesn't think they are hot enough?
3677 2018-03-15 16:44:42 I may not agree with the specific messages on their signs, but I support their right to protest.  I respect your right to your own viewpoint, but your argument loses credibility when you insult them based on your perception of their appearance.
3678 2018-03-15 16:44:24 He's upset over a sign. They're upset with being shot at. Not equitable

3715 2018-03-15 16:41:06 You’d better check on that again Donny. How many times have you had it wrong?
Maybe if you shut down crude oil imports you could balance the trade with Canada.

3717 2018-03-15 16:40:58 We're better off defining what we want then figuring out if it's realistic. 

"We want them to be a western democracy." is not realistic. 

"We want to control oil prices and take revenge on the Taliban." is realistic.

3727 2018-03-15 16:39:54 Hi Good morning. we lost our internet today. Finally got back on. Wow that was fast shipping. Yes @360Cookware designed it so you could cook with less oil and the food wont dry out. I know you will love it.
3728 2018-03-15 16:39:46 Find balance. Tell that to the oil prices.
3729 2018-03-15 16:39:42 No, I won't notice. Why are YOU noticing? Is there something your sister wives should know?
3730 2018-03-15 16:39:38 We can now buy CBD oil legally in the UK. I think the effects of THC are not great but CBD oil and those above 1% are helping those with MS.
3731 2018-03-15 16:39:31 Roy Moore would agree.....
3732 2018-03-15 16:39:28 Love these near my desk while I’m working. Lemongrass is my fav oil.
3733 2018-03-15 16:39:17 But because of places like Alberta and other places where oil and gas companies are the main source of income, we aren't going to see that progress until there is no more oil left and those said places become bankrupt much like most small towns when big factories leave

3747 2018-03-15 16:37:19 Thijs Van de Graaf (@thijsvandegraaf) proposes that oil market will be balanced by prices (market mechanisms) rather than by international organizations, such as OPEC. In this case, OPEC will likely be a crisis manager in the upcoming years.
3748 2018-03-15 16:37:17 Coconut oil saved my life
3749 2018-03-15 16:37:10 I wouldn’t think so Tammy. I know some people have experienced added color when using herbs on their hair, but I believe that’s from direct contact with the herb, not an infused oil.

3752 2018-03-15 16:36:59 ?? My point is that once the OPEC cuts are over it would only take 2 month for oil to have a severe glut again.  That is assuming there are really 20 million in cuts each wheel.  I doubt it's that high.

How about we don't hedge criticism of gross behavior?

Auctioning off virtually the entire US Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas companies. Yes you read that correctly.

3813 2018-03-15 16:31:01 Thijs Van de Graaf (@thijsvandegraaf) argues that, with current changes in the oil market, leaving oil in the ground may mean that it will never be extracted. Thus, there is an incentive for producers to extract now, to ensure that these are not 'stranded assets'.

3825 2018-03-15 16:29:22 I am doing research on CBD oil. I think it is worth a try. My only concern is even if it has less then 03%THC, can that cause a +urine test? It does work for seizures in cats and dogs, obviously not a placebo for them. Planning for the future of no pain meds. @Peter_Grinspoon
3826 2018-03-15 16:29:21 Oil producers &for the most part oil producing nations lack a degree of ethics. When we finally see the fault of our own transgressions, environmentally, in regard to appropriation of indigenous lands and wealth retention by a relative few, then perhaps we can talk ethics. #ableg

3830 2018-03-15 16:29:02 Fracking didn't happen in Illinois because it's not profitable here after oil prices dropped. I know the few groups who supported that law are trying to save face by taking credit but that's complete nonsense.

3834 2018-03-15 16:28:37 You are wrong! Pierre Trudeau wanted cheaper oil resources for central Canadian industries. He was preparing to 'nationalize' Alberta's oil industry. Stop trying to rewrite history!

3838 2018-03-15 16:28:00 In the ancient times, within the Roman Empire, in the Middle East or even in Asia, owners of slaves were rich because they owned slaves. Today, oil is called Black Gold but before, it is Black slaves who were refered to as Black Gold.  White slaves were called White Gold.
3839 2018-03-15 16:27:38 Hmmmm. I think you are talking about “most CBD oil products derived from hemp” vs “most CBD oil products derived from bud”. I could be wrong buuuut, CBD is just CBD.

3874 2018-03-15 16:22:14 So the NDP gets blamed for the drop in oil prices spoiling the Alberta economy (even thought this happened under the previous govt) then do they get credit for the price of oil nearly doubling under their mandate?  Just asking.

3877 2018-03-15 16:21:43 An analogy that I like is with the oil/gas industry: there’s production and there’s exporation.
Of course, we know that there’s innovation in production too, but at a high level, the exploration is analogous to innovation.#innochat

Also, I may have misunderstood what you originally said.

3962 2018-03-15 16:12:13 Just read the thread under her perversion of your tweets.  It's f-ing hilarious!!  A good lightening of the day! 
3963 2018-03-15 16:12:01 it's chili oil
3964 2018-03-15 16:11:50 As I recall, the 2017 budget was N6.06 Trillion. Are they saying oil revenue, taxes and all recovered monies amounted to no more than N1.70 Trillion? Someone needs to enlighten us.
3965 2018-03-15 16:11:50 I think they let in just enough to produce whale oil for our lamps during the long winters.
3966 2018-03-15 16:11:43 The essentials: Coconut oil, aloe vera, water, and some bomb ass....chocolate cake 
3967 2018-03-15 16:11:27 When I see fake UK accounts posting fake investing week in week out it just get me down on the whole fintwit fake trade back patting deal. Trading is hard work. Don't drink the snake oil. You need to put blinkers on and study. These fake investors are worthless to learners
3968 2018-03-15 16:11:25 "hot" - generally about sexual attractiveness. Any competent speaker of American English could tell you that.
3969 2018-03-15 16:11:21 You are the most prettiest thing that happened in the world, I don't know who and how. You are beautiful and whatever you do is beautiful,, I love you your inner child, your eyes, your efforts and they way you are unstoppable
3970 2018-03-15 16:11:10 If you like very chewy noodles, they're fine. But they'd be better after stir-frying them way longer than I did without any oil in the pan. Also probably better in an Asian-style dish
3971 2018-03-15 16:11:06 god bless coconut oil
3972 2018-03-15 16:11:01 And no one gives a shit about what you want
3973 2018-03-15 16:10:54 i'd be happier if Phil & Feryal ditched the spades, put on some waders, got down to the #leariver and cleared some oil...then put pressure on @CanalRiverTrust to make sure it doesn't happen again. less photo ops. more graft please. #hackney
3974 2018-03-15 16:10:53 Raw sewage is way more toxic than crude oil. Did #QuebecSewage killed the #RightWales? They started dying just after the big #Montreal raw sewage dump in 2016....hummmm.

3977 2018-03-15 16:10:38 Turmeric helps de-plaque and detox the brain, as well as a variety of other benefits.  When mixed with medium chain triglyceride coconut oil, it has a magnifying effect including anti fungal and anti microbial.  I'm not a doctor, just a person with eyes.
3978 2018-03-15 16:10:36 Ladies if you use the raw black soap please use a moisturizer after u wash your face because it's going to dry your skin because it's getting rid of the scars I put aloe Vera on my skin afterwards no need to put more oil on it....
3979 2018-03-15 16:10:31 Mark the Jewish Nazi.
3980 2018-03-15 16:10:28 -  Coconut & Honey Mask:
coconut oil is rich in saturated fats that nourish and moisturize your skin without making it oily. It also has antimicrobial properties that controls acne.

Honey also has strong antibacterial properties and hydrates skin, and give ur skin a soft feel.
3981 2018-03-15 16:10:27 Any how.  It's not about the environment or oil.  It's money and the Canadian government gets a boatload from off shore sources NOT to promote Canadian oil.
3982 2018-03-15 16:10:25 So what's the tourism boost argument in Edmonton?  Billions of people will see our beautiful oil patch?
3983 2018-03-15 16:10:19 Was just focusing on the math behind the dynamic. Oil patch 2014-15 was too sector-specific to be bear market in debt, FWIW
3984 2018-03-15 16:10:16 I’m at work with a coconut oil hair mask. That’s how much I don’t care about my job.

4004 2018-03-15 16:07:52 I think there is probably some value here. They all yield and while they trade far too correlated to oil most of their business is not tied to the price but just to consistent volume through their pipes
4005 2018-03-15 16:07:48 Basically my point.
4006 2018-03-15 16:07:30 Suffice to say that I'm not impressed.
4007 2018-03-15 16:07:29 I don't know how old you are, bro, but those kids clearly have more maturity and poise than you do.
4008 2018-03-15 16:07:28 So I just filled my car engine oil up for the first time in 2 years, cos it was finally empty.. oopsie 
4009 2018-03-15 16:07:15 I seen "- - - -" multiple times. "Running out of gas" is likely a ruse propagated by Big Oil anyway.
4010 2018-03-15 16:07:07 Accountable, to whom? Who should he be accountable too? Uk or USA or Iran or Israel who? They are rejected sanctions put on them, because they have oil and Gas. Which we can’t steal like we did in Iraq.
4011 2018-03-15 16:07:07 Interesting So, if an underage girl says "fuck me" that makes it ok? I'd love to hear you tell a judge that.
4012 2018-03-15 16:07:05 I was working in Peterhead in2013, we heard about a massive oil and gas field discovered.

Nothing reported

During ref, project fear that Scotland can't rely upon oil and gas

After the referendum, they announced the Culzean field was approved.

Odd that....

4036 2018-03-15 16:05:05 By your logic, the way to douse an oil fire is to pour more oil in it

4067 2018-03-15 16:02:14 I think the draft lottery will have a lot to say. What if Oil pick top 3 and get Svechnikov or Zadina? Maybe Ott falls to 6-10 and give their pick to Col this year? Does that make Puljujarvi the trade chip for Hoffman? Gives them a 20 year prospect in lieu of their pick.

4111 2018-03-15 15:57:49 Excited to launch Sunday Supper Series for @UChicagoAlumni in L.A.! Saw #MealsReadytoEat episode where Israeli and Palestinian olive oil growers sit down for dinner, and bond.
4112 2018-03-15 15:57:47 My doctor tests my oil every year, nothing to worry about. 
4113 2018-03-15 15:57:37 It's okay, seems like every notable niche RPG series is getting pounded into the ground lately. Ys is a robotic mess. Dragon Quest is on radio silence. Chrono Trigger looks like a smudged oil painting. The list goes on.

4116 2018-03-15 15:57:32 @seanhannity Just like the Arab oil embargo of the 70's, the Russians have us over a "nuclear barrel". They control a large percentage of our uranium reserves and provide our nuclear fuel. If they decide to cut us off, it could take months or years to find alternative supplies.

4118 2018-03-15 15:57:18 Mam when people get bullied by policies  they forget love across border. Media puts oil in Fire. Same fate has been of kashmir frm decades
4119 2018-03-15 15:57:14 Do you agree that the numbers seem to gyrate more than they should?  I very often see contradictory headlines concerning oil supply and demand within the same week and within a day or two even...
4120 2018-03-15 15:57:10 I'm fresh out of wet pants guesses...but how about this...did he spray his pants with canola oil!?
4121 2018-03-15 15:57:10 Oh I am so pleased you like it. It is a stunning face oil, very special I am hooked!
4122 2018-03-15 15:57:07 On that note, why don't we make our own commercial eucalyptus oil here in nigeria when we have the trees in abundance? Why do we have to wait for the white man to do everything? 
4123 2018-03-15 15:57:05 I kid you not. 3 years in when I first moved to Houston, I went to the bruhz Oil spill. I was in there thinking to my self "What am I doing?"
4124 2018-03-15 15:56:58 After kicking off the hearing with talk of corruption, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) suggests energy companies had pre-publication access to Interior's study on Alaskan oil reserves because Zinke reviewed it. 

Zinke says that's false, says he's owed an apology

4126 2018-03-15 15:56:53 Big Ag & big oil are the special interests destroying the work done by previous presidents to protect our nation from unnecessary pollution.
4127 2018-03-15 15:56:51 Rex Tillerson did his job. Helped Pres Trump get economy, oil n gas moving forward. End of his role. 
Trump is great at putting the right person on the right problem. Now its Korea n Military n Intel that need adjustment to Make America Great Again.
4128 2018-03-15 15:56:45 I get it - However, I wouldn't turn down the impact of an oil rich billionaire injecting some of his / her millions into the club. Most of us would acknowledge the positive impact on City and wouldn't turn down their success.

4133 2018-03-15 15:56:12 1000% correct .The only thing that he’s kept re our traditions is Gomes and McTominay given a chance and winning 2 trophies. Mourinho reminds me of oil mixing with water in regards to his version of attacking  I.e. long ball up top then feed off the 2nd ball.

4136 2018-03-15 15:55:52 There is no need for this booth at all. Nothing secret about the EPA mission. Pruitt is doing oil and gas deals on the side. Abusing his position. Shine a light on his behavior. The truth always comes out.

4143 2018-03-15 15:55:02 I store my jar upside down so the oil is at the opposite end of the lid.
4144 2018-03-15 15:54:56 So wouldn't be better for the environment to use Canadian oil?
4145 2018-03-15 15:54:51 My last visit to a Cracker Barrel was when I had to pull off the highway during a road trip because my car had a major oil leak while the clutch was flying apart. I feel this is the paradigmatic off-highway Cracker Barrel visit
4146 2018-03-15 15:54:45 She’s in Florida and she didn’t put sunscreen on. She put TANNING OIL ON. It’s her own fault i go “did u put sunscreen on” and she says “ya 4 SPF”
4147 2018-03-15 15:54:36 So don’t you think the federal government has an obligation to defend BC as well as our pristine coastline? An oil spill really would be catastrophic and Albertans really do NOT care about the environment as evidenced by the toxic tar sands extraction and settling ponds

4150 2018-03-15 15:54:15 Zinke pushes that he did not "change a comma" on a report an Interior scientist resigned over last month. Said he read it, and "wanted to know why the same data set was different from the same study three years apart, that grossly underestimated" US oil and gas reserves.

4158 2018-03-15 15:53:54 Scott Pruitt plans to allow more toxic mercury in our waterways, and air pollution from oil & gas operations on stolen national monuments.
4159 2018-03-15 15:53:51 i recommend topping popcorn with olive oil and ground pepper.
4160 2018-03-15 15:53:47 So if you are using GHG emissions as your yardstick, it's not hypocritical to buy the Saudi oil. Now, I would rather we used our own - but that doesn't make me lie about relative GHG merits.
4161 2018-03-15 15:53:45 3 hours for an oil change that I had an appointment for! You SUCK @NCentralFord. I bought both my car and truck with you guys but you just lost my money for maintenance services. What a crock of shit. I can go to firestone and get it done in 20!

4168 2018-03-15 15:53:15 What gets little press is that Elizabeth May was born and raised in the USA and spends allot of her time fighting against the CDN oil and gas sector which helps her home country continue to get our oil at a discount.
4169 2018-03-15 15:53:06 A few of the "honorable speaker" invitations in my spam folder: "Integrative Biology 2018", "World Congress on Oil and Petroleum", something about Hepatology, another about nanotechnology. My favorite is "Dental Practice 2018"
4170 2018-03-15 15:53:03 It’s just an expression in English. Metaphorically spoken. Nothing literal or bad about it. Here in oil companies people use that term all the time.
4171 2018-03-15 15:52:57 Tak setuju. Mesti ade sebab tertentu. Contoh, nak balancekan team laki perempuan atau xde tempat untuk perempuan penginap di oil rig. Pls bro jgan perlekehkan perempuan. Pengalaman saya tgok ramai eng perempuan hebat di tgah laut.

4183 2018-03-15 15:51:34 Even if someone out there creates cold fusion energy you know that basically limitless free energy would never happen with conservatives in power anywhere. Can't make money off it? It'll hurt our oil and coal burning? Well just create a false narrative about it being dangerous.
4184 2018-03-15 15:51:32 No... I think your argument is based on excluding everything *but* lumber and oil. If we include everything, then we have a trade surplus. If we pick a specific good, like maple syrup maybe there's a deficit, but that's not what's normally meant.

4186 2018-03-15 15:51:22 By all means, explain to me how the content of those signs somehow justifies this man making the argument about their sexual attractiveness
4187 2018-03-15 15:51:21 No straws are being clutched at this end Andrew. The oil which Russia is far too dependent upon has been used to bring unprecedented changes in infrastructure across Russia. Don't believe the claptrap you read about Putin. @CIA generated propaganda.

4189 2018-03-15 15:51:03 I need a good facial moisturizer. Say coconut oil and imma ash on you 
4190 2018-03-15 15:51:01 I was actually surprised by the recipe. It’s pancake batter from a box with a can of creamed corn added. Just don’t add as much water as the box calls for so it’s a thick batter where you can scoop up a ball & drop into oil. That simple
4191 2018-03-15 15:51:00 Well that's not fair. She has a drivers license, so she's way out of your preferred age range, William.
4192 2018-03-15 15:50:47 Typical predictable answer. If we showed you a picture of warthogs holding "I love the NRA" and "Trump is best" signs you'd wet your shorts, right?
4193 2018-03-15 15:50:27 My professor just said "now remember, saran wrap and olive oil are the two things you bring to an orgy"

4201 2018-03-15 15:49:57 I kinda wanna work on drawing traditional cartoons. Anyone know what kind of tools to use? Like would oil paints be good or would those markers be better, I honestly don't know what to expect, I haven't seriously done traditional art in a long time outside of a class.

4206 2018-03-15 15:49:17 I'm still mad @glossier made the priming moisturizer rich lavender oil scented. If you wanted a nice scent that didn't smell so clinical, you could've chosen a seed oil like rosehip. Instead you went with an essential oil, and the WORST essential oil irritant at that.
4207 2018-03-15 15:49:09 Hey there @jjhorgan See the Govenor of California is planning to sue Big Oil for murder - & in BC you @BCNDPCaucus are allowing a Texas company to run roughshod over everyone's rights. WHY IS THAT? How about supporting the people who elected you? #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
4208 2018-03-15 15:48:53 Good oil change 
4209 2018-03-15 15:48:52 Good ! Especially now that it looks like the cold spell is not over yet and we are going to have to rely on Russian oil that comes over here. Perhaps we can get Theresa to kneel down in front of the Russian Embassy for forgiveness in telling us porkies without a shred of evidence
4210 2018-03-15 15:48:49 I thought this would be about letting Canadian farmers use the trains to get their grain to market, instead of transporting oil (which should be in the KM pipeline upgrade). #trainwithgrains

4244 2018-03-15 15:45:50 To get NAFTA to pass in Canada Mulroney had to get the Queen to pack our senate. Any idiot who thinks Canada has been making out like bandits for NAFTA is just that. The second we stop selling our oil to the US at a steep discount, you guys lose big time.

4246 2018-03-15 15:45:18 I knew nothing about this index but the fact that it has retest its highest level means the OIL price might continue rising to new highest levels.. Just thinking loud

4255 2018-03-15 15:44:31 I’m getting an oil change, doing laundry, going grocery shopping, and maybe even signing up for college today. nothing can stop me.
4256 2018-03-15 15:44:24 Very well
4257 2018-03-15 15:44:19 When I first tasted Toro Albala PX, in 1998, the current release was 1971! This stuff is made from white grapes and takes on that motor oil character from just barrels and time and reduction. It remains the single most hedonistic, plush, fascinating dessert wine I've ever tasted.
4258 2018-03-15 15:44:14 Most of the “issues” you brought up as an excuse to keep burning oil were talking points created or paid for by oil companies. And even though most have been debunked, the lies continue to spread by people like you
4259 2018-03-15 15:44:13 You've got it wrong Faye-Alberta's been paying the alimony. Half a trillion and counting and zero respect for our oil and gas industry.
4260 2018-03-15 15:44:10 Calling you a shill is an accurate statement as long as you’re peddling snake oil and pandering sir. Give me something of substance. You have none. You began talking to me with allegations of “proof” - still waiting on that. All I see is a “Christian” who speaks without acting.
4261 2018-03-15 15:43:58 Thanks! That oil pan was really cheap and cheerful, I didn't expect it to last long but it still looks pretty new! It's just the right size for the wildlife and garden. Hope you find one soon :-)
4262 2018-03-15 15:43:57 @POTUS  Figures provided by the Office of the United States Trade Representative reveal that the United States ran a $2.77 billion surplus with Canada for 2017. That figure includes oil and timber. #FactsMatter.  Sorry @JustinTrudeau
4263 2018-03-15 15:43:52 @DrJoeAbah  48hours?  What kinda freezer is that, 3-6hrs your oil block is Che Che.

4272 2018-03-15 15:42:46 bio oil has genuinely worked somewhat miracles on my skin even within such a short time that scar on my hand/thumb from last year has cleared up loads and im really happy about it
4273 2018-03-15 15:42:43 Fighting against applied tariffs toward the steel industry... admirable. Why don't you do this for the oil/gas industry? We've been fighting US differential on oil pricing for years (never as bad as right now). This is a tariff and no action from you... thanks for nothing.
4274 2018-03-15 15:42:43 It makes perfect sence to treat imported oil same as domestic use same environment standards on all
4275 2018-03-15 15:42:39 It’s for change oil and tire rotation. Even tho I feel like they don’t do that shit

4277 2018-03-15 15:42:18 Lovely! (I couldn't find an oil pan at the Dollar Store. Boo. Will keep looking!)
4278 2018-03-15 15:42:14 Unsolicited advice. Entirely unwarranted. Man who fried fish in fish oil here giving useless advices. Who cares abt it after all?
4279 2018-03-15 15:42:13 There's a difference between a grown man directing such a comment at a grown man, or directing it at a group of teenage girls.

As with most things, context matters.
4280 2018-03-15 15:42:04 No flavors. Flavor = sweet = sugar but @SpunkLube does come in 4 different varieties. Hybrid (cum lube), pure silicone  (clear & non drying), natural (organic oil), & water based non staining please pink ;)

4283 2018-03-15 15:41:54 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today responded to a federal court remand by stating it no longer will allow master limited partnership (MLP) interstate natural gas and oil pipelines to recover an income tax allowance in cost of service rates.

We have lost control of our country.
Many of our lawmakers (not all) have been bought to just make laws for gun manufactures, Russia & big oil etc

4288 2018-03-15 15:41:07 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4289 2018-03-15 15:41:07 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4290 2018-03-15 15:41:05 Oh...I like oil too
4291 2018-03-15 15:41:00 Seriously, why does Melnyk's hatchet man try and take on salary?  A Klefbom & 1st for signed Karlsson, sure, but Oil can't.
4292 2018-03-15 15:40:55 They want to make money.....money from carbon taxing, carbon banking, climate eng, disaster economics, insurance, etc. etc.  Fear Porn makes money. And when you have the actual tools to really sell the "Snake Oil" message of #ClimateChange via climate eng, all the better right?

4294 2018-03-15 15:40:49 And messages like this, posted on social media, are EXACTLY why teen suicide rates are so high & school shootings are rampant. Online bullying.

4316 2018-03-15 15:38:48 Keeping  the govt jets on the ground would be a starting point ...look at the iron and steel pollution ..gain some credibility by stopping the sewer dumps ..keep oil spewing tankers off the East Coast...control methane from flooded forest land ..use Skype instead of wine and dine
4317 2018-03-15 15:38:40 Sick of positive messaging around Tillerson by some, simply because he was less insane than the rest of the cabinet. Recall: He was CEO of one of the dirtiest, most deceptive, most dangerous oil companies in the world, spending decades lying to the public on climate.

4319 2018-03-15 15:38:26 We don’t have a surplus in goods other than in the energy sector. But tell you what if you want to go somewhere else to replace your reliance on Canada’s Hydro-electric power or our Oil, then go ahead. We have great new trade deals in place with Europe and Asia. Do You Guys!
4320 2018-03-15 15:38:26 Is this picture supposed to show me how awesome you are?
4321 2018-03-15 15:38:24 So, my consultant described the condition of my eye as, quote, "miraculous"

The Avastin has worked wonders. I should only need top up shots every 8 to 12 weeks now.

Unfortunately, the oil will need to stay in, likely permanently. Means my close range sight will never improve.
4322 2018-03-15 15:38:18 $18Billion. We need to bring back most if not all of our companies mfg. We also need to start popping the caps off the drilled oil wells and start exporting. Start penalizing these companies who are still not listening. Off topic; arrest that traitor in Oakland; lock her up!
4323 2018-03-15 15:38:15 I need oil for my hair for moisture

4325 2018-03-15 15:38:08 Bag of crisps to tide you over. Turn oven on. Rub potato with olive oil and some sea salt. Oven for an hour. Don’t dick with a spud (no microwave either).

If the signs are too juvenile to warrant a thoughtful response (they are, I agree) perhaps its best not to respond. Perhaps, and this is the key, attacking the looks of 15 year old girls isn't appropriate.

4361 2018-03-15 15:33:20 For a non-toxic kitchen cleaner, fill a flip-top shaker container half full of baking soda and add 15-20 drops of a pure essential oil,
4362 2018-03-15 15:33:20 Businesses appealing against a rates rise in the north-east have lost a court appeal. They'd argued that the 2014 oil price collapse constituted a material change of circumstances. CBRE, which spearheaded the legal action, said it was extremely disappointed.
4363 2018-03-15 15:33:10 @BradWall306 perhaps AB and SK should provide future transfer payments in kind. Oil can be picked up at the AB or SK border, and transported away how the new owner sees fit. The oil will be valued at the world price. Let's see how quickly pipelines are built to tidewater then.

4366 2018-03-15 15:32:47 There is no trade defecit with Canada. It is a demonstrable fact. Your own WH studies contradict your words. I would remind you that 45% of your oil comes from Canada at a deeply discounted rate. That can easily change if you cannot bargain in good faith. @JustinTrudeau
4367 2018-03-15 15:32:33 US cannot save countries with corrupted government ran by gangs n drug cartel. they r forcing their citizens to flee to d US for money they send back to prop up their economy. Mexico rivals d US in oil n other resources yet, it cant take care of its citizen? cortuption! unfair!

4371 2018-03-15 15:32:07 Made it to Atl despite plane was leaking oil.  More updates to come after I eat my lunch.
4372 2018-03-15 15:32:03 Ahh shit unlucky. My oil leak was coming from my brake calippers and they cost around 100 each for the part to be replaced. Luckily not a major leak
4373 2018-03-15 15:31:56 By the way I don't need locking up.
I am locked up.
As I told you previously, I am clinically insane.
They don't let me out much since the cooking oil incident.
4374 2018-03-15 15:31:51 They're brilliant cars. Sub 10 minutes at the Nurburgring on Top Gear too! We tend to recommend a DPF regeneration with a 60k service anyway to keep it all working well. Oil will need changing after so combining with service saves in the Jaguar fund.

4378 2018-03-15 15:31:10 Do you think GHG emissions stay over Canada? We won’t transport oil by pipeline in our own country because it emits GHGs, but we’ll accept foreign oil transported by tankers, and turn a blind eye to their emissions. That’s hypocrisy.
4379 2018-03-15 15:31:04 looking at the amount of work I have to do  I need an assistant... in short I need an oil block.

4383 2018-03-15 15:30:53 yup.  He thought Oil tycoons make good diplomats.  He is right. They should but the Trump Tillerson Haley combo did not see eye to eye.  Plus we had Ivanka's husband in the mix marking his territory

4385 2018-03-15 15:30:44 But for some reason the "algos" continue to reprice down this sector on a daily basis... complete joke.
4386 2018-03-15 15:30:44 Also socialism as an alternative has failed in places like Venezuela but that’s because they funded those social programs with oil reserves which is great when oil is $120 a barrel not so much when it falls to $80 a barrel. The US has a much larger more diversified economy.

4388 2018-03-15 15:30:34 Screw you Thompson & the Alberta NDP. My 2016 job loss in Alberta was a direct result of the implementation of the carbon tax. It had nothing to do with the price of oil. #abpoli

4474 2018-03-15 15:22:03 The oil and gas aren’t going anywhere any time soon. NB and NS are facing an energy crisis. Everyone is about to get a big dose of reality. Same is about to happen across the country. World demand for oil is approaching 100,000,000 bbl per day.
4475 2018-03-15 15:22:01 It was not an attack, it was a statement. They will obviously not be mainstream conservatives, so he's correct.
4476 2018-03-15 15:21:59 ... and remember Trump thought biggest mistake in Iraq was failure to steal and keep their oil.
4477 2018-03-15 15:21:59 Lol I’m tight because I told myself before walking in “you’re only here for an oil change, Don’t let them pressure you into anything else.”

4513 2018-03-15 15:18:00 the modi guy was responsible for ethnic cleansing, violence and rape of muslims in the state he used to lead. he was banned to visit the US for a long time..the ban was removed only after he became the prime minister there.

4515 2018-03-15 15:17:35 VAT is to Lagos as oil is to the Niger Delta.
4516 2018-03-15 15:17:25 People ask me if CBD oil works. I tell them I tried something similar in the 80’s and it improved my appetite and made me a better dancer.
4517 2018-03-15 15:17:09 So instead you went to gross objectification of high school girls. Solid plan tough guy.
4518 2018-03-15 15:16:56 So by changing their name are they banking on people forgetting they are an oil & gas company and will be for a long, long time?

4526 2018-03-15 15:15:47 I guess PM Trudeau read your book the Art of the deal!  Canada’s surplus is so small it’s almost ridiculous & we need their resources & labour for our security. Already China is buying up their cities, & oil, intellectual property, so we need to shut them out integrate them! Fast

4532 2018-03-15 15:15:19 The world loves Trudeau and hates Trump.  Trudeau is smart, knows his facts and doesn't make shit up like your bumbling of President.  If you guys want to renegotiate fine.  Expect your oil, water, electricity, lumber, minerals, food and more to get more expensive.

4540 2018-03-15 15:14:20 Yes while Modi government should be criticized for not doing enough given mandate and especially when oil prices were low and for their protectionist and socialist turn,there’s no question they have undertaken some difficult reforms unlike the UPA during their high growth years

4542 2018-03-15 15:14:08 Let me get this straight, there is more than enough capacity in the world to refine our oil and this envi mentalist wants to build another refinery? This is nothing more than a delay tactic, building one would take years, they are just trying to kick the can further down the road

4552 2018-03-15 15:13:20 Understand why.    The Canadians were kings when the world needed their oil from the sand.    When the world found more oil than we can use,   that changed the game.
4553 2018-03-15 15:13:18 Both long and short got screwed in a sideways market this month, but the majority of retail were long $DXY and short $USO looking for oil in the 50's, not to mention those betting for #Gold in the 1200's. Most those options rendered worthless. Better luck next month.
4554 2018-03-15 15:13:16 Oil tends to do that, yes, the crowding out effect. We are getting back on track. People willingly chose a cheap salary over agriculture.
4555 2018-03-15 15:12:56 You're my therapist. Not just for oil, but for any headache I get, lol. Good points. I am learning a bit about India right now. There is a right wing craze going on there right now. Modi's party keeps winning local elections. That speaks to the problems that exist in India.
4556 2018-03-15 15:12:54 You know, it’s hard to have a partner who struggle in engineering area, especially in mining or oil. He will be there, in the site most of the time. And you just can’t do anything, he wouldn’t fast reply your text and only night the best time for you & him to be in contact.

4558 2018-03-15 15:12:48 I’m sure it has nothing to do with the oil companies making a bigger profit
4559 2018-03-15 15:12:44 Government ruled by bullshiting... why is anyone surprised? This snake oil salesman has been bullshitting his way through his entire life. Just look at his past - and his campaign “promises.”

4562 2018-03-15 15:12:24 Fasaden som miljønasjon blir enklere å opprettholde når vi ikke lenger får hovedinntektene våre fra et selskap med oil i navnet.

Norge har blitt en kvalm nasjon.
4563 2018-03-15 15:12:13 Will do. But if we're going to summarily dismiss the merits of asking for oil companies to pay for the damages that taxpayers will otherwise have to pay for through adaption, loss of economic activity, etc., we're dangerously close to dismissing the merit of common law as a whole

4586 2018-03-15 15:09:41 U.S. crude oil exports grew to an average of 1.1 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2017.  Crude oil exports in 2017 were nearly double the level of exports in 2016. Increased U.S. crude oil exports were supported by increasing U.S. crude oil production and expanded infrastructure.

4617 2018-03-15 15:06:02 "80% of animal feed is destined for animal feed, smaller percentage are used for oil or eaten directly."

That statement from Yale University doesn't suggest that livestock are just efficiently using a byproduct.

No matter where you're coming from or how pure your intent or how many articles there are, I'm telling you it comes across as a glowing review of an unproven, misleading snake oil treatment & cruel false hope.

4662 2018-03-15 15:00:57 Mo, we don't have a real enemy, so we have to invent one to feed the military industrial complex, make money, steal oil & help our corrupt mates in KSA & Israel. Many have indulged in misinfo, but right now Russia are the only ones fighting the terrorists. We must ask who profits
4663 2018-03-15 15:00:51 "According to figures provided by the Commerce Department, the US ran a $2.77 billion surplus with Canada for 2017. That figure includes oil and timber. It's unclear what Trump was referring to with the $17 billion figure."

4677 2018-03-15 14:59:57 the ants living behind the wall of my shower really seem to love the taste of my tea tree oil shower spray that is also apparently fatally poisonous to them

4679 2018-03-15 14:59:55 The way to make Putin hurt is to flood the world with cheap oil. Could also do a coordinated attack on their currency to drive down the value triggering inflation and recession in Russia. That would get his attention.
4680 2018-03-15 14:59:44 Tas sa salad, need muna ng vinaigrette. Yung vinaigrette need ng 1tbsp of olive oil and lemon juice or vinegar and salt and pepper.

4688 2018-03-15 14:58:47 carbon tax is a hoax though! BIG difference! Did you know the climate has changed naturally for billions of years? Besides that the point is that our oil is ethical and other countries arent!! So ya lets give unethical oil an advantage over our own! Sounds as dumb as the Liberals

4699 2018-03-15 14:57:58 I agree. However, after Iraq, govt’s can’t just say without corroborated independent evidence esp. on chemical weapons. However bigger agenda at play: Syria, Iran, oil+gas, spheres of interest threatened, domestic policy and Brexit scrutiny reduced. PR plays for May.

4708 2018-03-15 14:57:38 Not surprising, A problem with TW3 is the difficulty curve. Geralt and his equipment improve faster than enemy at level up so, the game gets easier. Two big steps are potions tier/ oil tier and the ability to craft green sets.
4709 2018-03-15 14:57:37 $mah.v has amassed a talented & experienced tech team for its pioneering horizontal drilling prgm.  “Based on our studies, horizontal drills produce 15X the amount of oil that vertical drills produce, & we are planning to complete between 8-10 wells this year,” Nesbitt.

4718 2018-03-15 14:56:59 One of the reasons I always buy any liquid, from olive oil, to vinegar, to hot sauce, in glass bottles. Also just got a home carbonator; if you like sparkling water it'll save you money.
4719 2018-03-15 14:56:52 If you don't change the oil, your car's engine gets dirty, starts spewing all kinds of noxious crap, and finally quits working.

Same with Congress.

4720 2018-03-15 14:56:49 Obama should have prosecuted the torturers to send a clear signal that Americans do not tolerate torture. Now they're rising up again like oil from a sunken wreck. Unacceptable.

4723 2018-03-15 14:56:38 Stock prices reflects several factors. I’m just talking about future shale oil production. A company that is increasing production is not necessarily increasing the price of its stocks.
4724 2018-03-15 14:56:36 I’ve been known to dabble in dipping into a squash and carrot, a leek and potato, or if I’m feeling fancy, a bit of oil and balsamic vinegar. I like to toast it and put salted butter on also. So it melts.
4725 2018-03-15 14:56:34 Is there anything better than eating fried chicken or tteokbokki outside in a tent, sitting on an oil drum? While drinking Cass and soju too.

4727 2018-03-15 14:56:12 We've received a report of spilled oil or fuel following an RTC on Attercliffe Common, near the Washford Road junction.  Take care in the area until our team arrive to clear it
4728 2018-03-15 14:56:11 I left my dab pen in the van when I got a oil change and one of the mechanics tagged it, I swear.

4733 2018-03-15 14:55:25 hehe :) I'd better give them a taste of their medicine.... make a batch of RSO that's made from 100% sativas and make a mean slab of a 100% indica... and every time they lie give them a drop of oil and make them take a dab. then when they recover give them heroin every time
4734 2018-03-15 14:55:22 Waiting for my oil to get changed, sitting here watching a really good episode of dateline minding my own business.... old dude walks in sits down and changes the channel without asking me.  didn’t say anything cause I’m trying to respect my elders.
4735 2018-03-15 14:55:19 Everything is wrong with them. Literally everything.
4736 2018-03-15 14:55:01 Russia & China are building a oil pipeline. Why does the EU continue to buy energy from Russia? What if EU stopped buying from Russia and instead bought from the Americas? Canada, USA, Mexico, South America. Would either bankrupt or force to work with free world. @realDonaldTrump
4737 2018-03-15 14:54:59 He does I agree but issue is that after Iraq, governments can’t just say it is highly likely without corroborated independent evidence esp on chemical weapons. Also, Bigger agenda at play: Syria, Iran, oil+gas, NATO expansion. Also reduced domestic scrutiny on policy and Brexit.
4738 2018-03-15 14:54:50 Not as much as Montreal.  Both cities oppose oil pipelines from the west because they are both concerned with water quality.
4739 2018-03-15 14:54:29 @DavidinNorthBur Question , actually really curious about this. Do the majority of people in Burnaby oppose the pipeline or are most indifferent ? Just read an article how American and Russian Oil interests are helping construct resistance to keep us out of Asian oil market

4759 2018-03-15 14:53:20 I just found out that they put beer on the fish and chip butter and the oil they cooked the fish in could contain non-halal sources. Or they could have used the same oil they used to fry bacon. Thinking bout all the fish & chip i ate in UK dulu lol
4760 2018-03-15 14:53:13 I've tried to explain the need to reduce veg oil production/consumption too, but it seems to be an inconvenient truth that it has doubled.

4766 2018-03-15 14:52:38 You do realize he just lied? Again. Do a little research before you agree with him. 5 seconds on Google and you would know that according to the Commerce Department, the U.S. ran a $2.77 billion surplus with Canada in 2017 — a figure that includes oil and timber.

4782 2018-03-15 14:51:04 The way to put a headlock on Russia is increase US oil and gas production to supply Europe at record volumes.
4783 2018-03-15 14:51:02 Watched him for years on CNBC......totally agree with you! One request is that you tell us what oil and natural gas storage is from the EIA the moment they are release each week 10:30 EST. Many thx

4787 2018-03-15 14:50:54 not realistic -- US already sells ~ $15b in beans and now over $5b in oil and gas.  would need to raise by factor of 3-4.   Chinese bean demand only $30b a year ...

4796 2018-03-15 14:50:23 ¿Cómo justificar que Cuccioli sea Director de AFIP, con el antecedente de haber oficiado de consultor para testaferros que aspiraban a quedarse con Indalo y Oil? No le alcanza con excusarse; el tipo ya carece abiertamente de cualquier atisbo de idoneidad.

4798 2018-03-15 14:50:15 The peas are an unholy addition. But the more zucchini the better. Add some sliced ultra thin and sauteed in hint of olive oil, fresh garlic,&heavy freshed cracked pepper to the top ehen serving lasagna or spaghetti = Life changing.

4805 2018-03-15 14:49:50 Because why? Is it because you just believed this lie? According to the Commerce Department, the U.S. ran a $2.77 billion surplus with Canada in 2017 — a figure that includes oil and timber.

4815 2018-03-15 14:48:39 Let me clarify. I'm not saying a college dropout can't understand. I only have a bachelor's in construction technology and I work on oil rigs.

But I've done a lot of reading on particle physics, black holes, quantum theory, etc

But it's clear Rush has done no independent study.

4825 2018-03-15 14:47:43 I don’t use olive oil or coconut oil on heat... only grapeseed& avocado oil

4858 2018-03-15 14:44:26 The vast majority of soya is crushed for veg oil production, which has doubled in recent decades as people have switched from cooking with animal fats. The resulting by-product has been used to feed livestock to save wasting it...
4859 2018-03-15 14:44:18 After the shale revolution, oil sands will probably be the next big thing.
Production costs are at 22 $/barrel with approximately 30 billion barrels reserve. 50% of it in the Uintah Basin in Utah.

4862 2018-03-15 14:44:03 I tagged sue because I see her as a voice of reason on the PM team and because at campaign time she was always vocal about being anti bsl. If there’s oil being thrown anywhere it’s because we’re in a dangerous time crunch with the government and our teams letting us down
4863 2018-03-15 14:43:56 If one owns something than it is theirs.  If we want it or need it, then negotiate a price.  If one can not be reached, then keep using all other cobalt available along with fossil fuels.  We have so much oil and natgas we will be fine without one hoarder's lot.

US has executed foreign leaders and started coups (e.g., Libya) wars for oil (Iraq), openly helped Yeltsin get elected, we torture and celebrate the torturers, and thousands die each month without health care.
4893 2018-03-15 14:40:17 Yeah, everyone wants to lose a top five LT, their leading rusher, #2 corner, and arguably their most clutch playoff performer not named Brady - all while the greatest TE of our time is threatening a new life of nuthuggers and baby oil.

4913 2018-03-15 14:39:07 When the world wakes up and gets its oil NOT from Russia, but elsewhere, Putin will have to sit up and take notice that his shenanigans won't be tolerated.  Is the European Union strong enough to do that or will they still enable him by buying oil from them.

4959 2018-03-15 14:31:59 Not sure I agree re: viability. If you factor-in all the subsidies and the externalities of burning oil (which we collectively have to pay for), renewables are in many cases, cheaper than oil.

5073 2018-03-15 14:20:14 There is a ton of hedging taking place at $60+ oil with Swap Dealers net-short a massive 622k contracts.  On a 5yr basis, using our Relative Strength Scoring system this = a extremely bearish score of 8% out of 100%, and historically this has lead to negative px dispersion.
5074 2018-03-15 14:20:11 THE AUDACITY??? HOW DARE YOU USE OLIVE OIL PANG FRY NG SQUIDROLLS??? HUHUHU

5076 2018-03-15 14:19:50 Like he campaigned abt how he thought we nvr shouldve gone into Iraq...except he did. Before the invasion he publically said that we should invade and "take their oil". Or he tweets out about a fmr Miss America having a sex tape (she doesnt) then 2 days later "I never said that"

You are a snake oil salesman in a cheap suit & weave. 

Jimmy, thank you for using your platform to do the human & right thing. 
I'm sure you get flack but your children will look at your actions/position & be proud. 
Thank you & stay strong
5080 2018-03-15 14:19:07 I was scared I thought they discovered me. It was not me. Of course I do not sell drugs. what are they going to do with the legalization of marijuana? Here, from Uruguay, they distribute cannabis oil with that story. but I hope you use it well. guys do not use unknown drugs

5097 2018-03-15 14:17:41 ...read the whole article-Trump goes on to describe how Trudeau conveniently left oil and softwood lumber out of the trade numbers-a $17B “omission”, hence Trump’s comment that “they outsmarted us”, and his desire to renegotiate NAFTA
5098 2018-03-15 14:17:35 What Mr. Kenney and some others in the #UCP either do not understand or do not want to admit is that if the oil prices were at $110/barrel, the Alberta economy would be so hot few people would be noticing the carbon tax. #ableg
5099 2018-03-15 14:17:27 I always seek out olive oil with a high acidity kick. Thanks!

5114 2018-03-15 14:15:50 Oil and gas price go up. Inflation. More hard times. More war in the middle east. Possible war in Europe.  Great.
5115 2018-03-15 14:15:40 The government can't do that...just ask Standard Oil or AT&T.

5124 2018-03-15 14:15:19 Trudeau dithers on pipelines.  We have only 1 customer, the US bcuz we can't get oil to other markets. We have to sell it to US at 25 to 30% under market value!  @JustinTrudeau's fault! Meanwhile US oil sales skyrocketing due to HIGH demand!!
5125 2018-03-15 14:15:07 Love your oil
5126 2018-03-15 14:15:02 Needs something a bit like the turbo timer on the RX-7 I drove last year. Kept the engine on for a minute after to circulate oil to the turbos. In this case it'd keep heat going to the DPF!

5143 2018-03-15 14:13:01 I was using medical cannabis oil, but that caused problems w/ my family during the big argument over my mom's guardianship/conservatorship proceedings. I chose that b/c NO ADDICTION properties, & my fam has a lot of addiction and suicides.
5144 2018-03-15 14:12:57 The science isn't clear. And the fact is we (& the rest of the world) are dependent on oil. Does Canada want oil from countries w/no environmental standards? Or our own w/the highest standards possible?
5145 2018-03-15 14:12:29 よかった
5146 2018-03-15 14:12:22 ...read the entire article...Trump, not knowing facts, bluffed on trade deficit numbers, but then his bluff was backed up and verified when you include oil and softwood lumber, which Trudeau conveniently did not

5151 2018-03-15 14:11:44 We have a monopolized economy, and those big dreamers who start small get crushed because there are zero incentives for them, unlike how easy it is for oil and natural gas companies to grow.
5152 2018-03-15 14:11:44 On the River Lea in east London. Local community very upset that 1 month after the oil slick appeared (now 5 miles long apparently) the, @EnvAgency & @CanalRiverTrust  have failed to clean it up properly. So as you can see local people decided to try and clean it up themselves
5153 2018-03-15 14:11:43 What bothers me the most is that the oil is being shipped in anyway, from another country. It makes no sense to be ok with it coming in on a ship but being pissed off about all of the jobs it will create and improve the entire economy overall.

Oil prices change.
5156 2018-03-15 14:11:31 They have had the same amount of oil as us, but it belong to the state, they didn’t sell it off to the highest bidder, hence they got 80% more per barrel than we got or get know, and have been squirrelling the money away ever since it came out the ground.
5157 2018-03-15 14:11:08 Its like you have already gotten the oil bloc you were pretending to be looking for. My services are available in any dept u need it in utilising the oil bloc

5213 2018-03-15 14:06:41 Even if you don't care about doing business with a barbaric theocracy, we are buying their oil when we should be utilizing our own. As a champion of the energy sector I would think this should be a priority for you.
5214 2018-03-15 14:06:38 I can tell if I've put it on too close to a meal. I try to put it on after each time he eats and then it's somewhat faded by the time he eats again. I have used coconut oil, too.

5216 2018-03-15 14:06:33 Of course there is a bright future for oil & gas sector (& nuclear) - it's just that Canada is not part of that future, for better or worse.
Others like US, Russia & China have made it a part of their future.

5222 2018-03-15 14:05:36 But his supporters either continue to buy the snake oil or they excuse the lies as, "politics."
This is neither. This is an ignoramus in office.
5223 2018-03-15 14:05:33 Foreign oil (meaning imports, I assume, rather than foreign-funded oil projects in Canada) isn't causing upstream or downstream emissions when it comes by tanker. It's not building a pipeline on Canadian soil. 

Give your heads a shake. Things like this make you look stupid.

5251 2018-03-15 14:02:07 The amount of oil isn't the issue. The amount of tax is. Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil, and he did. Oil companies have massive costs to set against profits. I.e., the tax take is low. So stop the conspiracy theories. They're pathetic.
5252 2018-03-15 14:02:05 You started it...  Your team's white paper said the price was $113 would go to $120 and then possibly upward &you'd all be so rich you couldn't count the money.... you banged on and on and on about oil (until the price collapsed dragging the tax receipts with it down the well).

5254 2018-03-15 14:02:00 Significantly more is needed both east and west in this country.  Enough so that we no longer need to import foreign oil. Instead of spending billions on imports that money would stay in the country to subsidize all the critics who have no clue about the industry and don't work.

5276 2018-03-15 14:00:26 My gripe is with false equivalence. The parties are not the same. Hannity and Maddow are not the same. Fox and msnbc are not the same. You are selling snake oil by pretending to be fair.  Don’t backtrack, you called them the same. Right wing media wins, since you are “leftist”cnn
5277 2018-03-15 14:00:06 I particularly like how the author titled their paper when writing about API's ad. By using "Oil Powers the Past", it cleverly drives home her point that the people that are trying to make oil as relevant as possible is the older generation #okie1113

5284 2018-03-15 13:59:13 @ElizabethMay U think we should sell our upgraded oil to a market called "
Canada"? So sell to a static, no growth market, no pricing competition, no product differentiation, brilliant business strategy...& who will spend the billions on up-graders? The #Greenparty? #LayThatPipe!
5285 2018-03-15 13:59:01 ALERT: If you enjoyed the Norwegian political thriller Occupied, season 2 is now on Netflix (US). A near future where Russia is trying to destabilize the world through control of oil resources feels less like fiction than it did in 2015.

c) From US perspective, the whole point of FTA was access to Cdn oil. Bit rich to complain about it now.

5461 2018-03-15 13:40:37 Canada has a surplus because a bulk of US imports are oil and gas. US has to incur a higher cost via fracking in relation to the current price. Hence Canada has a comparative advantage in oil production and makes sense for US to import. 
In other words, you’re a total dummy!

5539 2018-03-15 13:29:18 I didn't like #RexTillerson for saying it was UN-American to NOT subsidize oil companies. But I learned to like him as Secretary of State. I felt sorry for him when #Trump fired him on Twitter. Rex shouldn't have called him a moron. For Trump, revenge is best served cold.

5615 2018-03-15 13:17:41 I'm off to work and this is too sad a start to my day. We don't need to drill for oil in the ocean or in Alaska - this benefits only oil companies. I work with a company installing solar. 35000x our energy needs come from the Sun every day. More focus on green...
5616 2018-03-15 13:17:28 I went from asking "best beard oil in Nigeria" to asking "how much is methylated spirit". 
5617 2018-03-15 13:17:12 This one is painted with red oil 
5618 2018-03-15 13:17:11 "Successful businessman"

It's no wonder that literal snake oil sold so well before the FDA was established.
5619 2018-03-15 13:17:06 This highlight is complete disgusting and without connection with reality. You are supporting a murder. There are hungry children because of this ideology. This is so much more than "oil".
5620 2018-03-15 13:17:05 the filthy dirty works by the yanks to grab OIL with exchange of DEMOCRACY has no end
5621 2018-03-15 13:16:54 I’m so Caribbean that coconut oil
5622 2018-03-15 13:16:53 Are you supposed to tip your oil change man? Lol

5626 2018-03-15 13:15:49 Galitoz on oil libya
5627 2018-03-15 13:15:31 I suppose Thatcher could have put the money into better use than destroying the miners & unions with a lot of it. I’ll take the words of specialists at Aberdeen University who research the oil industry. I’m sure you won’t mind.
5628 2018-03-15 13:15:30 God is soaking your cane in crude oil..
Go to another group and announce to them
5629 2018-03-15 13:15:11 Why is a 'taxpayers' group getting involved in the oil controversy?  Is it because it isn't really a taxpayers group?
5630 2018-03-15 13:15:09 Avon skin so soft baby oil.
5631 2018-03-15 13:15:02 The impact would be much larger if the USA converts part of the economy from oil to gas,and exp. oil instead.Russia makes much more money with oil than with gas.On the other hand Mozambique and Tanzania will soon be able to export much more gas.Europe could improve efficiency.
5632 2018-03-15 13:14:52 C'est marrant ça, c'était il y a 2 ans !
le prix des carburants a changé, il est à nouveau sur la voie ascendante , puisque le gaz oil est à environ 1.05 €, et aucun journaliste de quelque "merdias" que ce soit, ne l'a évoqué ! 
Simple omission ou plutôt, compromission ???
5633 2018-03-15 13:14:26 Hot oil hair treatment and deep wash and condition this morning got me feeling good.

5636 2018-03-15 13:13:52 From my experience so far I’ve had it help ease menstrual cramps, and anxiety.. hadn’t noticed a change in energy but I have 3 drinks w/ the oil in it so I’ll definitely stay alert, I NEEEED an energy supplement of some sort.
5637 2018-03-15 13:13:47 Reading about hemp oil and seeds.... need to get some  Lots of benefits!
5638 2018-03-15 13:13:39 You need some eucelyptus oil decongenstant. That shit works like a dream.
5639 2018-03-15 13:13:33 However, as Much Fish Oil and Other OilsKeeps your E….
5640 2018-03-15 13:13:24 You left beans and yam and plantain and actual stews and soups not palm oil and skills
5641 2018-03-15 13:12:59 Pompeo took $375k from Koch 2009 - 2017 and ~$1.2 MILLION from oil and gas cos.  Classic example of DC swamp monster who puts interests of corporations ahead of the working people of this country.  
#VOTENOPomeo and #VoteNOHaspel. TAKE ACTION today to protect our country.
5642 2018-03-15 13:12:52 You have yet to learn the fine art of sycophancy. This one you're snatching wigs upandan? Your own oil block is in heaven.
5643 2018-03-15 13:12:52 There is a box called freezer. Get it first, then plug it into NEPA or a big gen. Buy oil for market(red, vegetable, castor, or any one of your choice). Pour the oil into a plastic cup and put inside the freezer. Your "Oil Block" will be ready after 2 hours.
5644 2018-03-15 13:12:36 im rly so happy for u oswald .. 2018 year of hormone
5645 2018-03-15 13:12:29 Just get a block and pour oil on it either  new oil or condemn oil. That's oil block
5646 2018-03-15 13:12:26 Not political correct to use the word 'oil'? The world has become insane. 1984 everywhere. My advice; keep the word oil and throw out political correctness.
5647 2018-03-15 13:12:15 Sesame oil + salt + pepper + meat = heaven
5648 2018-03-15 13:12:00 
5649 2018-03-15 13:12:00 We didn't burn much of the oil for power (the gas, yeah) Probably if we'd built 20 AGRs we'd have learned to make them work a lot cheaper. Missed a trick IMO.
5650 2018-03-15 13:11:39 It’s a must that I get my oil changed this weekend.
5651 2018-03-15 13:11:36 Despite the country is having the largest proven oil reserves in the world. Yeah Socialism!
5652 2018-03-15 13:11:32 Perception is very important in the things of God. The widow of the prophet in 2 Kings 4 did not see provision until Prophet Elisha pointed her attention to the oil that was left. What do you see? @PstSegunObadje #GGC2018 #GLTChurch

5654 2018-03-15 13:11:24 Awards for selling crude oil to Britain, and importing the finished product from Britain? Is it awards for mismanaging and killing all the refineries that Nigeria have? Is it awards for ripping off the treasury of funds from NNPC? Which awards? Idiots
5655 2018-03-15 13:11:16 @RussianEmbassy your nation can not take a large scale embargo of goods going to you and your oil going out. I’d advise you to admit it, apologize , put the midget dictator in prison now while you can still get toilet paper.

5661 2018-03-15 13:10:22 Presumably without North Sea Oil we would have been like France and the British coast would be ringed with those devastatingly successful AGRs.

5667 2018-03-15 13:09:47 Thoughts on Crosbie’s legislating ratio between gov spending & prov GDP, per Swiss eg.? When asked if such would hamper response to 50% reduction in oil royalties, he said it wouldn’t be a straight jacket & legislation can provide for fluctuations???
5668 2018-03-15 13:09:40 Wow.  Forced to watch @LiveKellyRyan @KellyRipa.  Painful.  Who writes the crap for this show.  Platypus milk? Terrible. Show will soon be off the air if it isn't fixed.  Ripa has to know it is going downhill and fast.  Ryan Seacrest is worst co-host in talk show history.
5669 2018-03-15 13:09:33 I am sure there are places with nice food but they are well hidden  When I will be home on Saturday I will stuff myself. I already have plans: steamed broccoli with garlic and olive oil, raw cheese and fresh bread

5673 2018-03-15 13:09:09 I am required to pay to clean up my trash.  Big Oil  should pay to clean up plastics and  The air. Big Auto should also have to pay.

5675 2018-03-15 13:09:07 WHY IS AMERICA KILLING THESE PEOPLE? WHAT IS  AMERICA'S INTEREST OTHER THAN OIL & GREED?
5676 2018-03-15 13:08:58 One way to do some of that: Produce our own oil and gas. It would drive down prices, and hurt Moscow since it’s reliant heavily on petroleum exports for cash. (And get the Europeans to ween themselves off of Russian oil and gas).

5700 2018-03-15 13:05:33 Not sure it was bible school, but Harper did drop out after few weeks. His family didn't want him back home, so his father got him a job out west as Mailroom Clerk with his Oil Company. Later he did go to Univ Calgary #cdnpoli

5703 2018-03-15 13:05:11 That's the next big bunghole:)
5704 2018-03-15 13:05:04 50000  more and we might  make a Dent  in the plastic trash in our oceans and land. Make big oil paid to clean it up. That would create some jobs.
5705 2018-03-15 13:05:03 i go to walmart to get my oil changed now and when i say “i would like your cheapest oil change please” they say “ok”

5707 2018-03-15 13:04:53 THANK YOU! So including oil and timber we DO have a trade deficit. And the formula used by Governments does not include. Why...since they are traded commodities? This reminds me of the FedGov changing the formula to calculate inflation...they took out groceries and gas. Why?

5721 2018-03-15 13:03:48 I think all of this depends on if you see farming as a source of food for your family, your community, or your country. Also, farms as business can be really hard on the environment due to consumption of oil products and not great soil management.
5722 2018-03-15 13:03:46 Rose oil ini kok ternyata benar benar melembabkan kulitku yah, aku sangat berterima kasih sekali pada dokter obgynku yang dulu memberikan resep minyak ini buat bekas jahitan pasca operasinya aku, ini sekarang minyaknya bisa banget buat muka wqwqwqwq

5734 2018-03-15 13:02:42 There may be bidding rounds for marginal oil fields (MF) coming soon ahead of the election. Simply assemble a team of technical expertise and financial backers to bid. MFs are not oil blocks but it’s a good way to start and learn the ropes.

5756 2018-03-15 12:59:18 You have to agree that oil price is main indicator how profitable oil companies can be, and look little bit back how painful low crude was for companies, of course dept pops up and of course it takes more time to recover, but oil com. have huge potential if oil holds/rises IMO.
5757 2018-03-15 12:59:13 Simple! Pour oil into your ice block compartment and put it inside the freezer. And there you have it. Oil block.

5828 2018-03-15 12:48:57 it’s so important to know that stopping using palm oil all together is causing more problems!! palm oil is the most natural sauce of oil however our excessive use is not substainable and we must understand that our orangutangs & other species are going and will be gone FAST

5942 2018-03-15 12:30:20 No it's not a someone. You can explain the force is oil and wind combustion.

So you can actually determine what is making it move in the formation and why it follows that pattern.

You see where your missing logic?

I'll be totally honest- I do weekly maintenance so I just 3 in 1 on literally ALL my machines.  but in a week (with them running all the time) there isn't enough time for the oil to draw contaminants so I know I'll be ok.  If that stretched to 2 weeks+ Id stop

6035 2018-03-15 12:12:34 'cuz a personal condemnation will stop him from doing it again?  Check out oil prices.  There's your sanction
6036 2018-03-15 12:12:32 the $100bn ask is really a dumb approach. China should call his bluff by offering to buy an extra $100bn worth of U.S. oil/gas/beans - any commodity that is storable - per year. Sell Treasuries, buy & store commodites.  Then change nothing in the underlying trade relationship.
6037 2018-03-15 12:12:25 If you listen to the raido you will hear a lot of SNAKE OIL SALESMEN selling garbage and harmful products so when your I HEART RADIO and your in Bankruptcy proceedings you’ll sell anything to save your ass
6038 2018-03-15 12:12:09 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
6039 2018-03-15 12:12:06 FACT: Postmortem fame is most frequently found in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.
6040 2018-03-15 12:12:00 The USA has a trade deficit including oil and timber... however, that’s not how these numbers are calculated, so Trump was wrong... in other words, he was saved by including those 2 components...
6041 2018-03-15 12:12:00 Well they certainly have influence in that area. #Russia. Largest #petroleum industry in the world. Largest #oil reserves. Largest exporter of #naturalgas. 2nd largest #coal reserves, 8th largest #oil reserves. 1 of the largest producers of oil. New #woodburner anyone?

6043 2018-03-15 12:11:03 @mrjamesob because it’s our seasoning. If you go to Thailand you have fish sauce and chilli oil on the table.

6053 2018-03-15 12:10:27 Vinegar will preserve it but oil can spoil when exposed to light and get an awful taste so I would refrigerate unless it's in a bottle that doesn't allow light to get to it.
6054 2018-03-15 12:10:17 I introduced an oil serum into my skin care routine a few years ago and slowly introduced different types. I’m now use 1 for day and 1 for night, followed by pure Maracuja oil after each. No other moisturizer!

6056 2018-03-15 12:10:12 According to your own beliefs i would be inadvertently supporting Bush's invasion of Iraq because i use oil.
6057 2018-03-15 12:10:06 Have a nice fried sweet potato hash cooked in ghee or olive oil. Diced sweet potato, onions, peppers, chopped up fried egg, add some coconut aminos if you really want the soy flavor. Delicious and it’ll scratch that itch. 
6058 2018-03-15 12:09:47 Exactly! I looked at the lady like damn all I came for was an Oil change and inspection.

6061 2018-03-15 12:09:26 i dont really eat fast food anymore but i've got a great recipe for breakfast rice. cook up 3/4 cup dry basmati, and when that's got about 10 minutes left you wanna saute about a quarter of a medium/large red onion in olive oil, rice vinegar, and either lemon juice or mandarin

6066 2018-03-15 12:08:19 Do you use oil?
If so, you're doing the same as I am. You're reaping the benefits of an evil, and in doing that does it mean you support Bush's oil-inspired invasion of Iraq? No.
6067 2018-03-15 12:08:03 3 in 1 oil will lubricate and easily be cleaned off.  The PTFE spray will be...difficult and likely to get "gummy"
6068 2018-03-15 12:08:02 I did a DIY oil cleansing method when Daniel was an infant and it took a solid year for my skin to clear up. Not sure if it was the oil or stress/hormones. It was awful, 27 with cystic acne is not pretty.
6069 2018-03-15 12:07:54 I guess excess oil keeps it from spoiling quickly. Maybe that's why there is so much of it in hotel foods.
6070 2018-03-15 12:07:53 Boil brown rice. Wait for it to cool down. Use olive oil spray to fry the blended onions/chilli. Add frozen mixed vegetables. Add rice. Voilà

6073 2018-03-15 12:07:12 India's trade deficit for Feb narrowed to $12 billion compared to $16.3 billion in the previous month. Imports for the month of February stood at 37.8 billion dollars, up 10.4% led by higher crude oil prices whereas exports for the same month stood at $25.8 billion rising 4.5%.
6074 2018-03-15 12:06:58 And seed oil, and other shit. Why? The best peanut butters on the planet are all 100% peanut. (PS: This is just Kraft peanut butter relabelled anyway.)
6075 2018-03-15 12:06:40 Mix a drizzle of oil in with #nuts and #seeds and add 1 heaped tablespoon of hot #chilli powder and stir in before putting in your feeders.
Squirrels cannot tolerate the heat of chilli and it's harmless to #birds.

6078 2018-03-15 12:06:07 Hey Jim. I heard you on @CNN saying the “shrinking arctic ice cap opens up new opportunities for oil exploration”.  Kind of perverse, don’t you think?  Maybe we should try and stop the icecap shrinking by using less oil. #justsayin #smh #climatechange
6079 2018-03-15 12:06:03 Happy Thursday Everyone. No new news on my house yet. Hope you're all well. I miss and love you all. I am trying the cbd oil for my pain. I took the first dose yesterday and I woke up with no pain. Awesome feeling. Sending hugs
6080 2018-03-15 12:05:54 Thank you so much!! I know I hate coconut oil on my hair so that makes a lot of sense. I’ll try a more gentle toner but I was using ACV to try and lighten my  dark spots. Recommend anything else for that?

6087 2018-03-15 12:04:17 @OSKIA I met the lovely Katja yesterday in Brighton, she was really helpful and she was also kind enough to give me a sample of the restoration oil to try, thought it was worth a mention.
6088 2018-03-15 12:04:14 because of the price of Oil Canada is no different than Saudi Arabia but when Oil goes to $10 a barrel so will Canada

6092 2018-03-15 12:03:43 Correct!

Most people know that engine oil lubricates to help with metal-on-metal contact, but it also helps cool & clean the engine as it circulates.

6102 2018-03-15 12:02:54 Great. The AB gov can add a sales tax. Stay revenue neutral by killing its oil industry. Lose thousands of jobs. But gain overall by become a “have not province” and reclaiming its fair share of equalization transfer payments. We’re almost there. Liberal logic.

6106 2018-03-15 12:02:32 Has anyone noticed that Bush, who has ties to oil, went to war with an oil rich country. And Trump, who owns resorts, spends most of his time golfing? You're going to tell me that gop presidents don't only serve their interests. Lol btw how much did 44 spend on golf?
6107 2018-03-15 12:02:28 Oil is supposed to stay in the earth. It is the planets blood. It helps prevent earthquakes. We must find alternate fuel

6145 2018-03-15 11:56:37 Global oil demand is expected to pick up more quickly this year, but supply is still growing at a faster pace leading to a rise in inventories in Q1 of 2018, according to the IEA's latest monthly report.

6154 2018-03-15 11:54:03 There are numerous oil producing countries in the world and Norway is the exception rather than the rule in having an oil fund. To argue that the UK was somehow remiss in not having an oil fund is ridiculous.

6157 2018-03-15 11:52:35 RT @P_U_R_R: Eucerin (good for acne prone skin), Clinique moisture surge (dry skin), La Roche-Posay Effaclar Mat (oily skin). Coconut oil is great but that heat in Nigeria, I’m not sure it’s advisable. 
6158 2018-03-15 11:52:35 I couldn't hack it  1 day of high fat was enough (lightweight)  then I read coffee oil can raise LDL, just as I finished morning espresso. That was 3 days ago, blood drawn this morning. I'm "......" results next Wed.

6166 2018-03-15 11:51:01 Getting the oil changed in the van this early and cold morning. Suddenly they crank up the radio and I hear @Travistritt Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof. It’s gonna be a good day.
6167 2018-03-15 11:50:58 Please follow my colleague @Dembik_Chris in Paris who is staying on top of this data. Perhaps he could add oil although i think #gold might be a better fit.

6172 2018-03-15 11:49:29 I really need some lavender essential oil 
6173 2018-03-15 11:49:22 Louisiana is owned by oil and gas, not interested in people or their health.
6174 2018-03-15 11:49:19 Btw how do you apply the aiken tea tree oil?
6175 2018-03-15 11:49:19 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
6176 2018-03-15 11:49:14 So maybe start making oil companies and  American franchises pay tax? I don't know maybe that's considered to be communist thinking.

6179 2018-03-15 11:48:48 AFPW: (0.0005) - Candidate for reverse merger with Dark Pulse Technoligies. DPT makes sensors for oil pipelines and possibly border wall detection. DPT is currently in a JV with BVTK and now is looking for a shell to trade on it's own, maybe even NASDAQ.
6180 2018-03-15 11:48:09 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
6181 2018-03-15 11:47:28 I wish Listverse would actually update some of the crap they circulate, because most of the subjects they list do have explanations. Like the placental jellyfish swimming near the oil rig camera.

6183 2018-03-15 11:47:08 Emulsified oil cleanser. I use it to remove face makeup, swatches, and brush makeup cuz it’s oil/balm that rinses off with water, no soap needed.

6186 2018-03-15 11:45:58 Israel otherwise known as the Deep State which controls their stooges in the U.S. like  Nikki Haley are hell bent in creating the Greater Israel in Syria and Lebanon because there is OIL in there. This is deja vu from the Iraq war, exactly the same thing.
6187 2018-03-15 11:45:54 @OwenJones84 When should the US/UK intervene in a crisis? Iraq and Afghaniatan were disasters, mostly a result of the meddling from decades prior. There have been instances in which we *should have* intervened, but Darfur crisis in 2005-06 didn't have oil reserves to exploit.
6188 2018-03-15 11:45:45 Hair oil keeps my hair from absorbing extra moisture and @TRESemme hair sprays.
6189 2018-03-15 11:45:44 Maintenance is crazy. Imagine spending $1000+ on an oil change.
6190 2018-03-15 11:45:44 Hey!! How about we build a pipeline (shaped like a 30 foot wall) to bring Gulf of Mexico oil to San Diego. Problems solved!
6191 2018-03-15 11:45:26 Big oil, HSBC, Rothschilds, zionists, arms dealers, private health.
6192 2018-03-15 11:45:24 a hundred years ago they were running around the desert chopping each others heads off, when the oil runs out, in another hundred years, they'll be doing the same.
6193 2018-03-15 11:45:07 Thanks to the nationalization of oil production & government-imposed price controls, Venezuela is hunger, food shortages & humiliations; 75 percent of Venezuelans lost an average of 19 pounds last year. SEAN PENN DOESN'T CARE he has no compassion for them just his pocketbook
6194 2018-03-15 11:44:53 1) this is a stunt—Arnold and his lawyers have NO STANDING to sue the oil companies 

2) lawyers should have their law license removed for such legal malpractice 

3) once again, the 1% looking to control the 99%
6195 2018-03-15 11:44:27 Yes, Almond Oil!!!!!

Please be aware of the difference between legal CBD oil and Rick Simpson oil. They aren't the same thing. You cannot just buy THC oil like you can with CBD oil.

6216 2018-03-15 11:41:33 I don't think so. Slowly marching towards Russia with more North Korea influence and an oil pipeline there. The whole thing is about restoring Russia's prominence on the world stage.

6219 2018-03-15 11:41:06 Finland has about zero immigration. Norway isn't part of the EU and has exessive wealth due to oil. Meanwhile Sweden has dropped to 9th place. You can't look att this and say high taxes = Happiness.
6220 2018-03-15 11:41:06 Går vel litt på at "oil' ikke er et ord som klinger like bra i disse grønne tider?

6233 2018-03-15 11:39:28 Index funds are passive investments that mimic the performance of a particular market. If Daniel Biss dislikes that the index funds in his IL GA pension invest in oil and tobacco he can opt out and request a return of contribution. Participation is voluntary. #ILGov #twill
6234 2018-03-15 11:39:25 Sean Penn's good buddy friend Chavez and Maduro, caused Venezuela to fall from being the economic envy of Latin America – rich in oil and with a vibrant economy – to being one of its poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Democrats supported this.
6235 2018-03-15 11:39:18 I went to a free pizza night tonite and he was like "any1 here like vines" I was like uhh yer and he was like "oh u seen that one where they put the oil on the floor-" and I was like "COME GET YALL JUICE?" And then we became friends

6241 2018-03-15 11:38:17 It's basically a rip off of the World War era but without planes and tanks, due to no oil, creating a stagnated era to mess around in. I always get lofty ideas of making it into table top game or something lol
6242 2018-03-15 11:37:33 Then why do they obey politicians and kill for nothing, except for oil, and to benefit Israel.  Can you name one justified war since World War 2?

6247 2018-03-15 11:36:05 With the governor vetoing that critical infrastructure bill it appears that times have changed for oil and gas lobbyists. Key bills from a tax break to this measure failed to become law. There was a time when things like that would pass handily on request. #wyleg
6248 2018-03-15 11:36:05 But is it not true,why are you not honest with yourself? You dnt have to hate Buhari or criticize every move just to sell Kwankwaso,it doesn't work like that,your position is becoming questionable to be frank with you.

6250 2018-03-15 11:35:38 It’s becoming more apparent we we’ll never know what truly is happening. As there are more reports from civilians giving their own accounts that contradict the version of Assad’s/ the rebel regimes that is being offered by our press. However I suspect oil is at the root of it all
6251 2018-03-15 11:35:35 So in other words the Repubs want to “skewer” Lamb?

Maybe they need some oregano, olive oil and garlic?

6264 2018-03-15 11:33:52 density doesn't work without gravity, oil and water would mix if there was no gravity. So ye, that picture is useless, please use your brain before posting a useless meme.
6265 2018-03-15 11:33:43 To understand the oil & gas industry, start from a country that,s already doing it.

6347 2018-03-15 11:17:39 Oh No. Depreciating rupee will increase the cost of imports, especially oil, which we need to import. Which in turn will increase inflation. Hence a better Idea is to make importing difficult, delays, red tape, new laws for environment and then tariffs.

6356 2018-03-15 11:16:37 Obviously s couple of good reasons 1. Oil is controlled by government employees who don't have the technical know how. 2. Corruption is rife and the money is as usual in a socialist 'democracy' going upwards instead of down to the people.

6366 2018-03-15 11:15:10 There is a balance to be struck. Venezuela is strawman. Many problems - unfree press, populist politics, curse of oil. Too much socialism, given that mix. Irrelevant for UK.

6471 2018-03-15 10:56:51 The Germans and EU are scared of Russia because they are so reliant on their oil and gas, we didn't see their heels for dust in 2006 when Litinveko was poisoned with Polonium in Lodnon. Now they want to rely on Britain for keeping them safe, lets see how they support this time??
6472 2018-03-15 10:56:05 As for starting in the winter, most cars in Canada are sold with a block heater. Just have to remember to plug the car in! :)
And use synthetic oil.  Costs a little bit more but better for your engine.

6474 2018-03-15 10:55:09 Then when you’re a mom it’s coconut oil and breast milk. 
6475 2018-03-15 10:55:09 Make the suggestion to them. Oil is priced by the barrel Sold by the barrel Productivity / output is measured by the barrel You are correct
6476 2018-03-15 10:55:02 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius

6494 2018-03-15 10:49:02 Documentation is the castor oil of programming. Managers know it must be good because the programmers hate it so much. #Agile
6495 2018-03-15 10:49:00 Like an artist creating an oil painting, you must take a few steps back from the canvas of your life, to assess all of your activities and accomplishments — the individual brush strokes of your life — from a wider, more holistic perspective.

6498 2018-03-15 10:48:29 Há controvérsias nesse "ñ quebrou"... Outras players de oil and gas foram compradas nesse meio tempo e tinham múltiplos melhores. A Petr3 só não teve o controle tomado pq não tem como... Enverga mas não quebra.
6499 2018-03-15 10:48:29 Thanks nice chatting. Bit at end a bit gratuitous tho. Don’t work for oil lobby. But my mainstream business members are all working hard to effect a durable long term low carbon transition that will work for future generations

6505 2018-03-15 10:46:49 Blah blah. Come onnnn @ToyotaGB Give us a great #Toyota pure #ElectricVehicle ,we know you can do it! Get back that pioneering EV mantal you used to have , forget the snake oil concepts of “clean diesel” or “hybrid petrol”. I have faith you guys will eventually see the light!
6506 2018-03-15 10:45:52 Macron/ Micron's, I never know which, position on Russia and nerve agents wouldn't have anything to do with the EU's reliance on Russia for gas and oil would it? oh no, silly me, of course not.

6512 2018-03-15 10:43:09 ANC is deeply divided. 

I am praying for The President @Chief Cyril Ramaphosa.

Bad/old oil cannot be mixed with new oil.

God help Chief Cyril Ramaphosa

6528 2018-03-15 10:40:17 Those who avoid Fats (oil) are the dumbest person.Fat is important and yes its rich in carbs 1gm fat have 9 calories. Dont avoid Fats just change its source and limit the amount . Research on Fats and there are lots of ways to have it without side effects. #ThaknaManaHai

6535 2018-03-15 10:39:45 @GOP pushing for coal tax credits, as solar tax credits decline to 10% after 2022. Republicans have NO vision for the future. AND! Gas and oil industries are STILL getting federal subsidies while hitting record profits. WTF???

6542 2018-03-15 10:37:12 JBS Haldane suggested burning Cayenne pepper as a tear gas in WW1 and demonstrated it in a hall full of people using an oil lamp and metal saucer. Not a popular move.
6543 2018-03-15 10:37:07 The palm oil that was on the beach between Bacton and Mundesley has now been collected and removed by our contractors. About 90kg of palm oil, which is non-hazardous waste, was removed. NNDC will monitor the situation and deal immediately with any further sightings of palm oil.
6544 2018-03-15 10:36:46 Putin: 80% popularity in Russia. Why?

Massive increase in living standards
The economy is still doing well in spite of low oil price and sanctions.

Unlike Yeltsin he has never fired on his own people and allowed oligarchs to steal assets.

Unlike Gorby he has a stable country.

6546 2018-03-15 10:36:18 Now we’re just repeating ourselves. You keep taking the cash from your oil industry members to push their interests, I’ll keep taking donations from regular NZers who care about climate change to push their interests. Our grandkids can decide who did the right thing
6547 2018-03-15 10:36:15 They're also the same people who lost it when Laura Ingraham told LeBron to 'shut up & dribble'. Leftists don't mind u talking as long as u say exactly what they want u to

6561 2018-03-15 10:33:18 Twitter, Google and FB are breaking our AntiTrust laws. We need no bill of rights. We need the govt to break them up, just like they did with Bell and Standard Oil way back when.  #BreakUpFBTwitterGoogle
6562 2018-03-15 10:33:17 Not much that can't be fixed in civic life by creating community hubs it seems. They have become snake oil, phlogiston and the philosopher's stone all rolled into one
6563 2018-03-15 10:33:16 Omg this looks as if it were painted in oil

6571 2018-03-15 10:31:40 Having “tried, failed, learned & tried again for 46 years”, Statoil has now recognised it’s not so much an #oil major as a “broad #energy company”. To reflect that, it is saying “hi to change” . . . & rebranding itself as “Equinor”

6609 2018-03-15 10:21:58 At the lowest oil price in decades we have doubled our reserves while coming out of recession. This must continue for at least another 3 years, then govt can consider some inflation. While govt has it's shortcomings, this is an amazing achievement that reflects prudence.

6612 2018-03-15 10:21:22 80% or more of capital spending in 2030 still on oil and gas, according to the wire report, is not much a change overall and not significant in terms of global climate crisis. complacency kills.

6631 2018-03-15 10:19:08 Why do I even waste my breath on an Okie? But you are the reason this country got effed up with the likes of a snake oil salesman and you don't even get your being taken.

6632 2018-03-15 10:19:07 It’s always helpful to remember that the number of people who think like this is much smaller than it seems like on Twitter. Even a tiny number of us, burning some extra midnight oil, can more than make up for the efforts of the #H8%.

6653 2018-03-15 10:15:30 Unfortunately it’s too basic to describe the behaviour of the oil market. No one explores to depress prices.  They explore to meet demand at the clearing price.  Only depressed demand will lower price and that’s happening due to substitution and that’s good for the climate.

6716 2018-03-15 10:06:20 We're at £78.6bn (2015); I think they reached the £100bn figure by adding in £19.4bn of oil and gas exports, which is now looking rather optimistic.

6725 2018-03-15 10:03:45 I'm surprised, plesantly surprises that Statoil is changing names to Equinor. I was hoping they would a while back. Seem they thought of it too. This means that they realize that oil is not the future. Based on their huge investments into renewables, the change seem to be genuine

6768 2018-03-15 09:56:41 Statoil want to find more oil so it can be burnt. By adding to supply they will ensure that global oil prices will be lower than they would otherwise be, all else being equal. That is basic economics and it makes climate change worse.

6862 2018-03-15 09:40:57 #Trump made up facts about trade deficit. When corrected by aide, said "We have no deficit but that doesn't include energy and timber — and when you do, we lose $17 billion a year." Do you want us to stop exporting oil, Mr. President? #cdnpoli

6868 2018-03-15 09:40:10 Using baby oil for Massage, strange han??
6869 2018-03-15 09:40:04 OMG you mean the UK has been asked to provide proof! Sacre bleu! We didn’t need proof during Iraq why now? We need to go to U.N. and state the case for Russian ‘smugness’ this is proof enough and they have more gas gold & oil so we can get a better Brexit deal on security
6870 2018-03-15 09:39:46 My old car broke down the week I was meant to move with a broken radiator, and the one I have now has burnt through 2 full tanks of oil in a week and a half, makes a very strange rattling noise when it accelerates and has another unrelated engine light on..... Kill me.
6871 2018-03-15 09:39:45 Fox News Anchors know that when Orange Hairpiece talks the 'truth', a famous mouse subscibes to the #NYT
6872 2018-03-15 09:39:18 Yes there was. UN inspectors reported this too. It was manufactured dodgy dossiers from regime change and access to oil against international law. Millions of people throughout the world could see it and the consequences.
6873 2018-03-15 09:39:12 Have you ever wondered just how our country can be getting so lax, allowing so many of our rights to be taken, even handing them away??

6874 2018-03-15 09:39:08 What’s employee count on TRUs? Because he’s such a snake oil salesman that he brags about new job list while neglecting to subtract massive job losses. Sort of like the trade deficit he can’t wrap his head around. It’s a “net net” game. #ToysRUs #Unemployed #JobsReport #winning
6875 2018-03-15 09:38:29 Maybe she's crying because he just told her it's one time & the last thing she'll ever get from the GOP, and that they just handed 30 billion and up each to the Koch's and the Mercer's and the Edelman's, and the Murdochs, and the Oil Companies...money they didn't earn or need?
6876 2018-03-15 09:38:26 Yup. Scamming - Sorry all Major Dealers!! I had a Major Service at Audi Waterfront once and then few days later, the oil was not feeding through the engine. Told me i needed a Oil Sump Service costs R4500 - Really? Why cudnt they tell me that before i drove off...
6877 2018-03-15 09:38:18 Other than sunk costs, extraction costs and energy transportation costs oil is free. Traders uplift and appropriate its value add.
6878 2018-03-15 09:38:09 have they discovered oil underneath it or something?
6879 2018-03-15 09:38:05 @TataMotors please explain why we need to change oil every 3 months when we are not using the car.
6880 2018-03-15 09:37:36 @elonmusk if your diner/restaurant supercharger idea isn’t 100% vegan then it doesn’t matter how many gallons of oil you’re saving. Can you spill some beans on the plans? 
6881 2018-03-15 09:37:18 Where it gets interesting is what happens if (as I would in their shoes) the purpose of China's new Shanghai oil contract on 26th March (backed by 1 bn bbls of SPR) is to end US oil price domination/manipulation & cut the $ price #OOTT
6882 2018-03-15 09:36:48 Canada! Want to save that $500 million? You can reduce greehhouse gas emissions just by shutting down the tar sands and coal fired power plants. Put all those fossil fuel emplyees to work on developing renewables - and make Big Oil pay for it. #ActOnClimate #Canada @cathmckenna
6883 2018-03-15 09:36:36 SGS report: M’sian palm oil product export for March 1-15 fell 4.9% to 604,034 MT from 635,298 MT shipped during February 1-15 #FCPO #palmoil

6885 2018-03-15 09:35:54 Also take into account that SD was with oil objective NA 1.4 and epi was with water NA 1.27. so it is not totally fair comparison, I would need to reacquire with the same obj + smaller z sampling

6887 2018-03-15 09:35:39 Great to hear. If your feeling down again take a bath in olive oil while eating ice cream. It's very relaxing and just a crazy thing to do. Careful getting out though, it's a logistical nightmare and an oh&s hazard.

6904 2018-03-15 09:32:51 Maybe but at least the Pennsylvania special election shows the cult may not be as large as it once was. Some have realised Trump is no more than a snake oil salesman.
6905 2018-03-15 09:32:51 Not because they think of public safety it's to bolster USA UK world bully partnership. Fear the people into handing over more human and civil rights and to trigger ww3 or the cold war again. Money oil gold drug trade control and power. Its the elites goal.

6924 2018-03-15 09:30:27 Yeah, oil demand will disappear due to electrification. Personally I stopped believing in peak oil in 2003 because I worked for Schlumberger and had a sneak peak into their technology development.

6937 2018-03-15 09:27:25 I must admit I bought into Global Peak Oil around 2007 -2010 (and I wasn't alone, even the IEA were talking about it) but the lesson is clear now that high oil prices will stimulate new recovery techniques. I still think we need to initiate Peak Oil from the demand side.

6952 2018-03-15 09:23:17 My thesis is US Inc (Cohn & Tillerson) have hitched the dollar to oil by monetising/benchmarking US shale reserves & acquiring a Saudi Inc (MbS CEO) subsidiary. That's the effect of #EnergyDominance strategy. I doubt whether Trump/Kudlow are capable of understanding the subtlety

6989 2018-03-15 09:13:55 IPMAN please tell them, if they cannot refine crude oil locally (the most beneficial option to Nigeria & Nigerians), at least they should be able to guarantee a steady supply of the products - any "fortunate" Nigerian in charge of that department will do an excellent job there.

7003 2018-03-15 09:11:15 If you increase supply, all else being equal, you will decrease price and increase demand and hence climate pollution. To say anything else is to subscribe to climate denying economics to suit the interests of oil companies.

7028 2018-03-15 09:05:12 På sikt tar olja slutt, og forhåpentlig klarer vi byttet til fornybar energi lenge før det. Ordet oil/olje har etterhvert har fått en PR-messig negativ klang, den trenden vil øke. Statoil har innsett begge deler, og gjør nok dette både for PR, og for å vise at de er mer enn olje.

7303 2018-03-15 08:09:48 What profound idiocy!

Of course when oil is at high price per barrel borrowing should be less.

7617 2018-03-15 06:49:55 Kids can influence the constitution at 18 because the US Gov has no problems drafting us at that age.

7712 2018-03-15 06:31:38 It’s not drilling of oil that causes climate change. There are unquantifiable factors but if you’re going to blame oil it’s how oil’s used that’s making an impact. He’d have to sue everyone that has a vehicle or lives in a home that uses oil which is everyone. Including himself.

7840 2018-03-15 06:05:20 .@stephenkinzer is an amazing author & historian. All The Shah's Men is one of the greatest books I've ever read.

7979 2018-03-15 05:31:35 CBD Oil is about to be legal in Indiana. Lawmakers I want thank you for making the best migraine medication on the planet available to Hoosiers.
7980 2018-03-15 05:30:19 Yeah, and last year Venezuela stopped selling their oil for US dollars, that makes them enemy numero uno.
7981 2018-03-15 05:30:14 While you were ptotesting 8 tankers of imported oil were at the Washington state refineries where you yvr get the majority of your fuel and they all sail right past Victoria
7982 2018-03-15 05:30:14 There's no such thing as gas shortage, man. It’s all set up by the government, everything's controlled by the oil companies. Like I heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water, man. It’s fiber glass, air cooled and it runs on water!

7984 2018-03-15 05:29:47 They have been declining as some Asian countries stopped importing from Iran.  But where is the oil?
7985 2018-03-15 05:28:57 If I wore that at my gym, I would get some serious dirty looks.

7987 2018-03-15 05:28:48 Sí! Besides hydration, moisture helps to make the hair more flexible to eliminate breakage caused by dryness. In my spray bottle, I either use solely water or I make a DIY leave-in spray (it’s just a small amount of conditioner + oil).
7988 2018-03-15 05:28:46 Tell me why I’m slabbing Trader Joe’s coconut oil all over my face
7989 2018-03-15 05:28:39 if you are so much against the Shaira law, why don't you raise up against deep US - SAUDI relations? Why don't you do anything for the Saudi people? Where is the sanctions on their government? Oh, you are busy making them rich with oil money.

7993 2018-03-15 05:27:23 that seems like foul play.. or just never changing your oil idk

7996 2018-03-15 05:27:05 I’m hungry but my mom already threw away the oil from the tacos de papa so I’m fucked
7997 2018-03-15 05:27:00 Which Israel are you talking about?  Israel discovered oil and gas as early as 1980's. However, it became commercially viable in early 2000's. #JoshuaNjengachats

8010 2018-03-15 05:23:49 Midnight Oil is underrated, at least in the US
8011 2018-03-15 05:23:26 I like a few items from dr Dennis gross and dr brandt at Sephora. However, MN put me onto vitamin e cream from Walgreens and I’ve been using for 6 months and I love it. They also have vitamin e oil, so I lather 1/2 cream & 1/2 oil, has helped w/ breakouts too

8015 2018-03-15 05:22:55 Since opiates are so accessible on the street and truly can be addictive, they've gotten a bad rap. It's even harder for Dr and pharmacists to prescribe in GA. It would be nice if THC oil was another option. I avoid opiates now because I'm a recovered meth addict.

8017 2018-03-15 05:22:45 Lol, only if you compare it to coal and oil, not wind and solar.

In terms of capacity per dollar nuclear is far more expensive then wind/solar to build out at this point, it's completely obsolete.

8021 2018-03-15 05:21:53 More leftist BS.  We need to utilize our natural resources and stop relying on other countries to produce oil.
8022 2018-03-15 05:21:36 He who is free of oil can cast the first stone against a pipeline.
8023 2018-03-15 05:21:35 Oh My God! So we quit buying oil from the Middle East  dictators  and started buying from the Russian Mafia country! Yes the government is broken! What's scary is is that Trump was too sell our oil reserves! I wonder who gave him that idea!
8024 2018-03-15 05:21:35 You forgot the lines at the gas pumps. We were still dealing with Vietnam times were bad. The Saudis were in control oil prices we had hostages in Iran death and destruction and civil unrest. Then Disco happened. Carter inherited a mess and Reagan inherited a nation on the mend.

8037 2018-03-15 05:19:23 The foreign oil is not subject to the same environmental regulations that Canadian oil is. Why is that? Shouldn't it have to be transported by the same safety regulations? It's only a matter of time before one of those OPEC tankers springs a leak.
8038 2018-03-15 05:18:59 OK I love girls with a decent, legal hustle.....but the things some sell on IG, leaves me confused....like what is pawpaw oil abeg or carrot oil? 
8039 2018-03-15 05:18:55 A major segment of the goods Canada exports is crude oil (US still only produces 50% of it requires) which is then refined to create “American” value added goods. Since that crude is heavy and Canada few export markets, the US gets to buy it at a relative discount.

8054 2018-03-15 05:17:00 Jiffy Lube has a habit of insisting you "need" completely unnecessary repairs. I'd definitely have it checked by a trusted mechanic before paying for anything! (Also, have them double-check that Jiffy actually changed the oil. Sometimes they don't.)
8055 2018-03-15 05:16:53 OK, anyone here for thoughtful deliberation? Canadian oil industry creates Cdn jobs, pays Cdn taxes, royalties & carbon tax or carbon tax exempt Saudi oil? As long as anyone has any dependence on fossil fuels, lets add a Canadian size serving of virtue, please or #cutthetax!

8058 2018-03-15 05:16:31 I rarely retweet anything like this  but this time is different. This needs as much attention as it can get and beyond. The oil industry is on life support and it needs to be unplugged. Let big oil die.
8059 2018-03-15 05:16:28 Obama micromanaged the military and wouldn’t let them attack ISIS convoys carrying oil if it might cause an oil spill or kill the drivers. Can’t win a war with one hand tied behind your back.

8221 2018-03-15 04:46:45 It is like a novel by Kafka or Chekhov.
Trump seems to appoint the LEAST likely or effective leader in each of his government positions. Climate change deniers in the EPA, oil magnates in fuel control...gun maniacs in gun control.
It would be funny if it were not so serious.
8222 2018-03-15 04:46:38 I don't do modern medicine or try not too. Garlic olive oils lemon and three thieves diluted with coconut oil are my sick remedies and I rarely get sick.

8225 2018-03-15 04:45:57 At least Quebec as a rainy day fund. With all of Alberta’s prosperity, our misguided devotion to low taxes did not allow us to prepare our province for life without high oil prices. Unfortunately the largest two parties plan to continue this unsustainable trend.

8267 2018-03-15 04:38:50 This was tried in 1974-75 because if the oil embargo. It was a disaster
8268 2018-03-15 04:38:23 4 me nothing beats tiny cutoff Jean shorts ,a tiny tee top and open toe shoes/sandels.oh yeah ...and slightly covered in Oil.
8269 2018-03-15 04:38:18 The one time I check my oil. I fucking over fill the bitch with oil! WHY IS OIL A PROBLEM FOR ME
8270 2018-03-15 04:38:18 All these “other” hair care brands feel as though they can just slap “infused with coconut oil  “ or some other essential oil/ butter(Shea)  and “WE” are going to be inclined to buy it
8271 2018-03-15 04:38:07 A good shampoo and conditioner with Jamaican castor oil and a light leave in conditioner lol. And dont overpick it
8272 2018-03-15 04:38:00 tried cbd oil once and now my life is perfect wow link in bio
8273 2018-03-15 04:37:57 What a shocker. The overreaction to 2015-16 will likely keep this team from becoming the powerhouse it could've been. Oilers will still be good and win at least one Cup but the pieces were in place to build something far more special. Oh well.
8274 2018-03-15 04:37:50 Anyway here's me putting peppermint oil on my wrists to try to keep the ants away while I sleep because 'springtime'
8275 2018-03-15 04:36:50 ที่สุดอะ นี่เพื่อนแบบเมนคนอื่น ละพูดว่าเกรดน้องไม่เหมาะถ้าได้เด เราก็แบบ เห้ย ไม่เกี่ยวกันป่ะ แต่ก็แอบกังวล
8276 2018-03-15 04:36:34 Didn’t Laura Ingraham just get slammed for telling Lebron to shut up? Ok lefties, which is it??!
8277 2018-03-15 04:36:16 Found some patriots here to follow 
8278 2018-03-15 04:36:15 たまたま寄ったコンビニでプリチケグミあった(๑°ㅁ°๑)
チョコミント系の飲み物はないなぁ
8279 2018-03-15 04:36:07 You can do same in OIL
8280 2018-03-15 04:36:01 i want to try sannakji for some reason. ive been watching some youtube videos of it and so far every video ive seen make them look so fucking good, esp when u like dip them in hot chili oil or something. like id legit eat that shit...
8281 2018-03-15 04:35:59 Newfoundland never seems to catch a break, renewable or non-renewable. PMSH provides no exemption for their oil under equalization, and they essentially subsidize the Québec Hydro that comes from Labrador.
8282 2018-03-15 04:35:48 “Burning the midnight oil”
8283 2018-03-15 04:35:37 And don't tell the oil and gas industry that they will be contributing, all this damned time never ever will anyone attempt to get funding from them because no elected official has the balls.
8284 2018-03-15 04:35:36 Sure.... that’s what the call it? “Commitment to and solidarity”? I guess by that they mean that Venezuela will keep on supplying cheap oil in exchange for the Caribbean’s political support  of this DICTATORSHIP . That’s how Vzla buys wills and OAS votes. SHAMEFUL!!
8285 2018-03-15 04:35:33 よっしゃ〜〜〜〜

8286 2018-03-15 04:35:27 My mom bought me this oil diffuser thing for my birthday, and I've low-key been turning it on when I sleep because it makes my room smell good. But I can't tell her or  she'll try to pyramid scheme me
8287 2018-03-15 04:35:13 If only you all saw me before bed & how much moisturizer, serums, eye cream, lip balm & beautifying oil I lather on 
8288 2018-03-15 04:35:02 Bagus kok. Oil controlnya lumayan diwajah aku yang oily sekitar 5 jam an gitu dibagian hidung udah mulai berminyak dan kudu ditouch up lagi, coveragenya medium kalo wajahnya ada flaws kudu pake concealer dulu.  7,5/10 deh nilainya
8289 2018-03-15 04:33:54 I’ve actually been using their Jamaican Castor Oil shampoo and conditioner to aid in the process of helping my hair grow. I really like it.
8290 2018-03-15 04:33:37 This is so true. A have a good share of my life and have never change a tire, changed the oil. I could and would but...
8291 2018-03-15 04:33:34 After 30 mins Ima just throw the hot oil on my hair with the conditioner lmao fuck it. I still gotta plait or twist my shit down
8292 2018-03-15 04:33:34 AND NO, REAGAN WAS NOT THE GREAT DEREGULATOR OF TRANSPORTATION (TRUCKING, RAILS, AIRLINES), BANKING, INSURANCE, ENERGY (OIL COAL, NG,) & MORE; JIMMY CARTER WAS! AND YOU THOUGHT REAGAN WAS THE GREAT DE-REGULATOR.  HOW DUMB OF YOU!
8293 2018-03-15 04:33:29 ต้องดู คือ เมื่อคืนกูนึกว่าพี่โป๊ปเป็นหนมครก หยอดจังงงงงงงงงง
8294 2018-03-15 04:33:20 I REGRET MY LAST TWEET I SPILLED THE HOT WAX EVERYWHERE IN MY KITCHEN PLEASE SEND HELP AND COCONUT OIL + FIRST AID BANDAGES
8295 2018-03-15 04:33:10 I wanna put coconut oil in my hair, but that just seems like a lot of work! 
8296 2018-03-15 04:32:52 うめーだのたみ。
8297 2018-03-15 04:32:48 Yeah. I’m pretty nervous. I really don’t think they are that far off. But they’ve been digging further away since the Hall deal.
8298 2018-03-15 04:32:46 Why oregano oil? I do shots of olive oil with . But what oregano oil for?
8299 2018-03-15 04:32:38 My daughters hair is past her freaking butt  like where tf did this come from . All this goddamn coconut oil lol
8300 2018-03-15 04:32:14 You know where extra virgin olive oil comes from?

The REALLY ugly olives.
8301 2018-03-15 04:32:12 I realise you're serious but do you realise that causing America harm is the main objective for Trump? Didn't Trump want to know why we didn't "Get the Oil" doesn't that square with what Kudlow said about Irag? Two of a kind. Look long and hard at all those around DJT now. Scary.
8302 2018-03-15 04:32:12 Growing up in oil country here in East Texas I know all of them from the edges of my memories as a child
8303 2018-03-15 04:32:00 AmSpec 
Malaysia Palm Oil Export 

1 - 15 Mar, exports fell  -2.1% to 595,536 tonnes from 608,447 tonnes
1 - 10 Mar. exports fell  -12.1% 

#Palmoil #Soybean #Commodities #oil
8304 2018-03-15 04:31:55 It is a scary thought & there is only so much $ to go around. All I can say is Chiarelli better win whatever trade he makes that involves one of Klefbom, RNH or the 1st round pick...not holding my breath #Oilers
8305 2018-03-15 04:31:36 まぁ服の外にブラつけるとかいう頭イかれたファッションが流行ってるわけだし全裸で出歩いても大丈夫でしょ
8306 2018-03-15 04:31:25 Jumping in...have you tried coconut oil? It’s what saved me moving to the east side of the mountains. I just buy a jar of it and keep it cool in the summer, and room temp in the winter.
8307 2018-03-15 04:31:09 Buti pa yung coconut oil
8308 2018-03-15 04:31:08 Ano  po magandang fish oil???
8309 2018-03-15 04:31:04 Too many broken links in our systems. We need a National & State Blood Banks, digitalized, online real time.
We can all organize our systems better.
People are not angry about NASS, it's not their Tax, it's oil money.
8310 2018-03-15 04:30:57 Which means there's no need to get an RFID protected wallet right? Asking since those seem like snake oil to me.
8311 2018-03-15 04:30:54 Alaskans own 29,400 shares of TOKAI HOLDINGS CORP, worth $225,849. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in JAPAN.
8312 2018-03-15 04:30:50 i just want my toughest decision in life to be whether i’m going to use a coconut oil or argon oil hair mask at night.
8313 2018-03-15 04:30:48 im so in... with being sick so much this season, and getting sick again, i definitely need a cleanse and a reset of my body... will definitely be taking oregano oil for the week...
8314 2018-03-15 04:30:45 サラシで街出歩いて捕まらないのかな
8315 2018-03-15 04:30:44 Forgot to mention the oil pipeline projects.
8316 2018-03-15 04:30:23 Cleanser oil untuk org yg makeupnya jarang2 atau cuma make cushion aja perlu ga?
8317 2018-03-15 04:30:19 @davidhogg111 Much worse than gun industry- Big Oil is going to kill everyone by destroying your environment 4 $$$
8318 2018-03-15 04:30:08 OIL DIFF: 3.97 -> 3.98
8319 2018-03-15 04:29:56 うめーだが職場だったら仕事終わりなんでもできるじゃん
8320 2018-03-15 04:29:53 What FK were you watching?
8321 2018-03-15 04:29:40 In the typical American way, Washington is forcing a one-sided 'trade deal' upon the Syrian people. It involves oil for blood with all of the blood being Syrian.
8322 2018-03-15 04:29:07 Oh you’re more than likely right. I just wanna see as many holes filled as possible. I’m very nervous for this off-season.
8323 2018-03-15 04:28:55 found it a little weird to use oil as a model for well-controlled externalities considering we’re all going to die in a world-consuming fire because of it
8324 2018-03-15 04:28:44 That was just one example. Getting back to the original topic, the oil industry has benefited and continues to benefit just as much from government subsidies and other support (i.e. "interference"). If that's capitalism....
8325 2018-03-15 04:28:38 & some watermelon in a bolsita with Chile de oil , salt & lemon 
8326 2018-03-15 04:28:30 Love fact Enron so influenced fail BCHydro. Am sure we all know Richard Kinder was minor CEO. Top mgmt went to jail at Enron, kinder got bonus bought oil co. Now kindermorgan.
8327 2018-03-15 04:28:13 And, of course, you'd be the last person in the world to lie or misrepresent anything.  I call economic snake oil.
8328 2018-03-15 04:27:40 Can I just poof myself to Mexico I’m like craving the Papas in a bolsita with chile de oil 
8329 2018-03-15 04:27:40 Ain’t nothing like taking a hot shower and getting out and rubbing coconut oil on your entire body. 
8330 2018-03-15 04:27:23 I loved Ned today! Acting like a boss! With good intentions! I really hope he is not involved in this oil scam. Forget sometimes how ruggedly handsome Ned can be!
8331 2018-03-15 04:27:20 When girls was  putting coconut oil on their face I never fell for that shit
8332 2018-03-15 04:27:19 I'm seriously considering moving back south haha. I'm the only mainah with a tan I swear. Got a nice burn @amsupdates. I'd go to @MartinsvilleSwy in a heartbeat if I had the gas to get there. My GMC Envoy about made me cry on fuel costs for Atlanta trip and back
8333 2018-03-15 04:26:28 Hey there Juan this is Cole from Midtown. I hope all is well with you and your Family. I have not been satisfied with much of what Donald Trump is doing. Recently this snake oil salesman fired my Mom's 2nd Cousin a honest hard working former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
8334 2018-03-15 04:26:22 Yeah maybe try that out like the vapor smell usually smooth me a bit and called me I hear peppermint oil helps too
8335 2018-03-15 04:26:09 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
8336 2018-03-15 04:26:08 @KremlinRussia_E #UK   DRAMA on #RUSSIA due poor MEDIA-MANAGMENT, Expose western leaders,disrupt Oil supply by pumping more oil-GLUT @POTUS  4toss real target is #WORLD @10DowningStreet  govt 2be toppled for #WMD lies going to WAR on SADDAM @mfa_russia-PUTIN 4PRESIDENT
8337 2018-03-15 04:25:32 do you have any vegetable oil or mustard? I used milk before and it seemed to help (got jalapeno in my eye once and burned soooo bad).
8338 2018-03-15 04:25:24 Well, if you’re not averse to using tea tree oil you can try it. I’ve heard ppl say it works well. tried it myself and it does help but I’m not as consistent as I’d like to be.
8339 2018-03-15 04:25:15 @jamescharles sisterrrrr I just tried the @SKINDINAVIA Oil Control Setting Spray that I saw you rave about in a video and loveeeeed it!
8340 2018-03-15 04:25:00 Vote YES and improve our fuel and cigarette taxes (which should go even higher)!  Oil & Gas are behind the GPT increase.  The $4,000 puts teachers above the area average!  Reasonable solution. @GovMaryFallin @officialOKGOP @OklahomaAFP @OKStandard @tulsaworld @okstatechamber
8341 2018-03-15 04:24:55 You guys all sure got hit hard! 
Can’t say I miss it 
8342 2018-03-15 04:24:51 Don't kid yourself my good man, he will most certainly be Talbot's backup next season. If used probably, I bet he'll be a decent No. 2.
8343 2018-03-15 04:24:44 My face produces more oil than any of those Arab countries. Damn.  I hope China doesn't find out.

8345 2018-03-15 04:24:40 Ive used CBD oil for pain and it’s helped me! I hope it helps you:)
8346 2018-03-15 04:23:54 9/23/90 - Phils 2 Expos 1, 16 innings. Oil Can vs. Jason Grimsley. No score through 11. T12, Delino DeShields drives in Moises Alou. B12, Dave Hollins drives in Dale Murphy. On to the 16th where Charlie Hayes plates Von Hayes off someone named “Howard Farmer”. Best game ever.
8347 2018-03-15 04:23:28 เพื่อลบคำสบประมาทด้วย อันนี้ยอมในความตั้งใจน้อง
8348 2018-03-15 04:23:22 Diamond oil?
8349 2018-03-15 04:22:55 What’s the difference between Jamaican Black Castor Oil and regular Castor Oil?
8350 2018-03-15 04:22:28 Love my Trump family! 
8351 2018-03-15 04:22:28 Aloe vera then coconut oil or shea butter right after
8352 2018-03-15 04:22:20 so how terrified is Leafs Nation of what the future might hold #Andersen

8354 2018-03-15 04:21:48 I thought he had a few horrid outings mixed in there but it’s semantics really. I just hope they don’t have him slotted in as Talbot’s backup next year. That’s all.
8355 2018-03-15 04:21:43 Go to a fee based business model. Let insurance pay for catastrophic like other insurance coverage we have. I don’t claim an oil change on my auto insurance
8356 2018-03-15 04:21:27 お酒飲んでたの私だけなのですよ…
8357 2018-03-15 04:21:23 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
8358 2018-03-15 04:20:57 And the tea tree oil??
8359 2018-03-15 04:20:49 Honestly man, like most of what we see over the final two months of the season, it doesn't mean much going into next yr. Hasn't been great of late but hasn't been horrible.
8360 2018-03-15 04:20:11 Coconut oil
8361 2018-03-15 04:19:54 Thank goodness this trifling snake oil saleswoman.  I hope the investors sue her for everything she has, which right now isn’t worth much.
8362 2018-03-15 04:19:42 wow i still remember the day i was buying weed n i asked my plug about cartridges (cuz i wasn’t really into vaping/distillate at the time) & he said other ppl sometimes cut the oil inside the cartridge with olive oil lmao wtf
8363 2018-03-15 04:19:31 Its fine if a B.C. resident drips a oil filter into his burning barrel it can cost him $1500.00 for each one found by the government that looks after pollution, liberals the lawless band some how can do it and its fine.
8364 2018-03-15 04:19:21 oof i regret eating that meal because it was too much oil fat and now i feel sick becaue i don't eat like that at all anymore since the past 10 years
8365 2018-03-15 04:19:15 Love that the feeling / smell / essence of wet earth actually has a name: Petrichor :') Some theorize it comes from the soil others think its an oil plants release when they get wet, Idk what it is i just know i love it +
8366 2018-03-15 04:19:07 Hi.   We got a story down here in Long Beach.   City and Oil company  (BOMP) are calling a 40 year drilling plan "wetlands restoration" 180 new wells on the Newport Inglewood fault.  We will litigate to stop at coastal commission.   Thanks
8367 2018-03-15 04:18:59 เหยแกกกก หลานทวดคนแรกมาค่ะ Unchi-oil Oil Kruefa คลอดลูกทีมคนแรกแล้ว ฮูเร่ ขอให้ ปังๆ ทั้งสายนะจ๊ะ

8369 2018-03-15 04:18:47 Excellent video, Mike; thanks. You articulated very well how the UK has been able to extend and magnify its presence through the EU. 

Alone, it's a tiny shivering bird on an ice floe, peeping and vulnerable. The US will run that ice floe down like a massive oil tanker. #ugh
8370 2018-03-15 04:18:39 And so crappy play and another give away and the Oil lose again! Changes need to be made from top to players, it's really disgusting watching this team lose time and again with giveaways sloppy play and no players giving a shit about the others.
8371 2018-03-15 04:18:35 Add oil 
8372 2018-03-15 04:18:24 Lol@fish oil
8373 2018-03-15 04:18:17 I wwas hoping too but I’m working the @WKA_Karting event @GoProMotorplex 
Hope to catch up with you sometime and catch a race!!
8374 2018-03-15 04:18:11 yes face oil but make sure it’s not too oily bc you don’t wanna look shiny lol
8375 2018-03-15 04:18:08 How about no longer giving Big oil companies free tax subsidies?
8376 2018-03-15 04:17:52 Peppermint essential oil 
8377 2018-03-15 04:17:41 Dipping 12 for an hour in the woods and getting stewed on by an oil pan
8378 2018-03-15 04:17:37 This is me intensely searching for an oil diffuser, despite the fact that I just bought would a month ago.
8379 2018-03-15 04:17:37 Coconut oil is real good at makeup removal (To my last tweet)
8380 2018-03-15 04:17:37 29 had a tough night for sure, but this Montoya thought isn’t based on just tonight. I think he’s been pretty poor since winning in Arizona in early January.
8381 2018-03-15 04:17:35 same here girl  I never got ANY type of "pretty girl discount." Girls out here getting cheap bud, free food, free oil changes. I WISH

8388 2018-03-15 04:16:25 We need Erin in Ca! To make Ca great again & stop the invasion! 
8389 2018-03-15 04:16:21 Rose hip oil, jojoba oil, vitamin c oil look into some oils
8390 2018-03-15 04:16:13 Followed all I wasn't
8391 2018-03-15 04:16:08 Got them all.  Love the Trump trains!
8392 2018-03-15 04:15:52 I heat up mustard oil, sauté a heap of smashed ginger and crushed mustard seeds, and then cook the saag until the water evaporates. (Sometimes I add a cup of warm water drained from whatever veggies/lentils I’ve boiled for another dish). Prep time 30 minutes max.
8393 2018-03-15 04:15:45 Fantastic article! I went through something similar (substitute 'tropical storm/ sinkholes' for 'oil spill') and appreciate how you explained it to others who may not have had the experience. Can't express how angry it still makes me that this happened.
8394 2018-03-15 04:15:37 I put lavender oil in my humidifier and am feelin luxurious as heck 
8395 2018-03-15 04:15:33 Stop sucking oil dick, reevaluate where money is being spent, raise other taxes without taking away our benefits, make it long term. Not one year.
8396 2018-03-15 04:15:29 You tried exfoliating before and using tea tree oil after?
8397 2018-03-15 04:15:22 Big save at one end of the rink from their netminder and a beauty of a finish from the Sharks at the other. No question, San Jose is playing well
8398 2018-03-15 04:15:19 Francesco Senatore tells the @NERAnetwork @AOG_Expo Collaboration Forum that Nureka is "... an open source platform providing  both innovation and collaboration capability within a single platform structure for users across the entire oil & gas ecosystem." #innovation
8399 2018-03-15 04:15:19 The worst one indeed! Perhaps he was good to make money with oil companies, but in diplomacy flunked!
8400 2018-03-15 04:15:12 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
8401 2018-03-15 04:15:11 Let’s get this over the top!  Oil & Gas are on board, the fuel tax increase remains too small to fully fund road spending and the cigarette tax is low enough to let more people die young...but at least it is a start! @GovMaryFallin @officialOKGOP @OklahomaAFP @oklahoma
8402 2018-03-15 04:15:02 I guess they thought I was going to pitch them snake oil or something.
たぶん彼らは、私がいんちき薬か何かを売り込もうとしていると思ったのでしょう。

8408 2018-03-15 04:14:23 Recently, I've slowly come to the realization that all my jeans have stains from either tea or machine oil.

8420 2018-03-15 04:13:01 Without oil we wouldn't have plastic stir sticks we all use to stir our hot beverages. Do you want that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
8421 2018-03-15 04:12:51 We are on it and it will be up and running as soon as possible. There is also significant research being done to make the shipping of oil safer. People sometimes talk to us like we don't care but they are wrong
8422 2018-03-15 04:12:48 When you run outta oil in your thc catridge

8426 2018-03-15 04:11:34 @1shankarsharma Sir..,  In a trade war world setup, can a country like India might be at a relative advantage compared to others?...If we net oil we aint much of an importer/exporter...
Maybe good for local companies in India from market point of view..?
8427 2018-03-15 04:11:18 I’m going to fry sous vide chicken whenever I feel like dealing with that much oil lol.
8428 2018-03-15 04:11:17 An unhappy oil supporter.
8429 2018-03-15 04:11:11 Great analysis; that is my impression too. Kennedy was most impressive, direct and sincere. Biss was a 19th Century snake oil salesman. Pritzker was too indirect.
8430 2018-03-15 04:11:10 Remember when Jesus said that the oil used on him was not wasted since you can always do good for others but you can't always do good for Jesus.
8431 2018-03-15 04:10:51 Actually if you take a biotin pill, pull it open dump it in a bowl and ass baby oil. Use a little before you put on mascara.

8440 2018-03-15 04:09:35 We've both been on this train for years now, though many suggest the game has never been better. To each his own but one thing I am quite certain of, the NHL isn't nearly as entertaining as it should be.
8441 2018-03-15 04:09:31 They came to Afrika and took your GOD (Gold Oil Diamond) and gave you their God. Even up to this day you are still defending theirs while they still using yours.
8442 2018-03-15 04:09:01 Just seen a chick say, you can cook his food in diamond oil and do backflips on his dick...if his eyes aren’t set on you, it’ll never be enough.
8443 2018-03-15 04:08:59 worse ... because trump is a well -known snake oil dealer, and they still believe he was selling them miracle medicine.  bernie hides that his bottles contain snake oil ... with a dash of unicorn.

8462 2018-03-15 04:06:20 Sorry I just saw this! But yeah it was pretty legit. Almost like “General Tso” flavored. Soy forward, then sweet, sesame oil for sure. Not as spicy as I would’ve liked though.

8465 2018-03-15 04:05:59 Melt coconut oil and leave it in your wet hair for 30 min and then rinse it out!! It helps control the curl !
8466 2018-03-15 04:05:56 The combination of State TV, Goal challenges, shitty officiating, and incompetent management makes it really hard to watch the NHL.
8467 2018-03-15 04:05:52 once i put on my bonnet and then coat my face in vitamin e oil, it’s a wrap my day is done.
8468 2018-03-15 04:05:28 JFK wasn't told by CIA nor Pentagon Brass about smaller tactical nuclear missiles and as the Bay of Pigs invasion failed while being observed by longtime CIA agent Bush sr on a Zapata offshore Oil platform, they demanded JFK send in the Marines to invade Cuban coastline. @maddow

8495 2018-03-15 04:01:53 The massive benefits come from Energy. Not oil per say. Nothing prevents humanity from dumping fossil fuels and adopting renewables and maintain the great benefits provided by energy.
8496 2018-03-15 04:01:50 Or CBD oil. It’s amazing.
8497 2018-03-15 04:01:47 Jah beg you watch over us
8498 2018-03-15 04:01:42 Observing that current projects have significant cost overruns is not kicking the industry any more than observing that burning oil emits carbon is kicking the fossil fuel industry. Factual claims are not assault. He's pretty clear that there is a big role for nuclear power.

8502 2018-03-15 04:01:03 Hahahaha wow. Talk about a joke. What are the requirements that one of the greatest goalies to play the game, who retired in 00’, took 18 years to get their attention to be inducted?!?

8509 2018-03-15 03:59:43 Man listen, vitamin E oil is the goat. When I was in 7th grade, I suffered from 1st and 2nd degree burns on my whole face except my forehead. So of course my face was tragic af. During the healing process my skin tone was just bad, hella uneven, and blotchy.
8510 2018-03-15 03:59:18 Outside of his contract, I have no real issue with Kris Russell but would it be possible for a broadcast team to talk more about a bottom pairing defenceman than the Oilers TV crew? It is rather ridiculous.
8511 2018-03-15 03:59:15 It's wrong to punish Canadian oil. We are a drop in the bucket compared to other countries. Nothing we do will make any difference either way!

8554 2018-03-15 03:52:37 While liberalization & Structural Adjustment Policies have a bad reputation, Rawlings had to embark down this route which started the process of undoing damage started by Nkrumah: reduced stranglehold of gov't on economic sectors, better for farmers, better for mining, then, oil!
8555 2018-03-15 03:52:34 can we all shut the fuck up and be glad cbd oil is relegalized?
8556 2018-03-15 03:51:43 this. THIS SO MUCH. "what does this perfect plate of pasta need? A SHIT TON OF TRUFFLE OIL CAUSE IT'S FANCY. OR A HALF KILO OF BAD QUALITY LOBSTER MEAT SO WE CAN TRIPLE THE PRICE." 

NO IT DIDN'T NEED ANYTHING.

8565 2018-03-15 03:50:51 You are not but in the eyes of some, there is apparently a need to bring in someone to "push" Talbot...which is complete and utter nonsense. Montoya will be just fine as Oilers backup in 2018-19.
8566 2018-03-15 03:50:46 Busy cashing in on Koch, NRA, big pharma, oil$$, and selling off public lands. Country won’t destroy itself.

8570 2018-03-15 03:50:36 The popularity of the sunflower in Russia stems from the Orthodox Church and its observance of Lent. While lards and vegetable oils were banned from consumption during Lent, sunflower oil was permitted at the time of its introduction to Russia.

8574 2018-03-15 03:49:20 It can be hugely beneficial for places like oil fields with low throughput requirements.

It all completely hinges on what the application currently is and what it will be.

Mesh can be an extremely useful tool in some scenarios.
8575 2018-03-15 03:49:16 I was very Blessed tonight I talked to Thomas and Krista Shirley on the phone and Thomas spoke God's heart to me of "How beautiful I am". I am blessed He has spoken that over last fall. It's like having oil poured over my whole being.Glory to God!Some spoken it is what i need

8577 2018-03-15 03:48:20 If he can’t score, he should at least try defensively. When he’s in the ice, the Oil play in a deficit. A pylon would be more effective.

8585 2018-03-15 03:46:32 One hour each school day should be devoted to learning about the economic misery in Communist Venezuela, then show the prosperous pre-Communist days as an oil rich nation just a short time ago. Food for thought for these children
8586 2018-03-15 03:46:08 Exxon pulled out of the Rosneft oil deal early last week.

8588 2018-03-15 03:45:31 Uhhh...Daniel Biss only made an average of 55K for the past 5 yrs, serving the people of Illinois, while Chris Kennedy was smart enough to invest in tobacco, oil, high-end real estate and the military industrial complex. That's a good thing, right? #DownIsNowUp

8593 2018-03-15 03:45:13 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

8599 2018-03-15 03:44:28 Positioning :
In a theatre when drama plays, you opt for front seats. When film is screened, you opt for rear seats. Your position in life is only relative. Not absolute.   For making soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required.  This is the irony of life.

8626 2018-03-15 03:41:14 For the time being. Hopefully you understand there is no future in oil.
8627 2018-03-15 03:41:09 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
8628 2018-03-15 03:41:09 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8629 2018-03-15 03:40:41 Tesla will spend billions (largely of taxpayer dollars) trying to perfect electrical storage devices (batteries), other companies will too. Ironically we already have a fantastic energy storage system. It’s called coal and oil and natural gas or #fossilfuels
8630 2018-03-15 03:40:34 Yeah oil co owns the Raceway and the network. Not the same deal

8639 2018-03-15 03:39:27 Fuck lol just try your best not to put any oil based products on them because they build up more dirt that way. The down side to that is they'll dry faster. I used to used heat protectant but they get nasty tangled.
8640 2018-03-15 03:39:23 Environmentalists?! @RachelNotley put @Tzeporah on the oil industry committee! A saboteur, if you will.

8644 2018-03-15 03:38:51 There will continue to be a debate over this, I don't smoke anything but if the oil can do what it claims then a lot of people will benefit from it.
8645 2018-03-15 03:38:49 Girls if you are having trouble with your hair not growing fast enough buy Castor oil and put it on your scalp every night  for an hour before taking a shower. Trust me it does miracles!
8646 2018-03-15 03:38:47 So sad to put oil over our own livelihood. Every day I am so happy to have switched to an electric car.
8647 2018-03-15 03:38:44 They taste horrible. The oil makes my tongue go numb.

8655 2018-03-15 03:37:23 This whole international situation needs to be rethought. Russia is not our enemy. Ukraine held elections after their independence. One province voted to reconnect with Russia. Russia wants Black Sea port for trading oil. Is that our business? Their enemy is Islam, too, not USA.

8691 2018-03-15 03:31:50 It definitely depends on where you're getting your oils and if they're actually pure. The FDA requires just 5% of pure oil for something to be labeled "100% pure." But assuming you get your oils from someone who third party tests their oils for purity, there are many benefits!
8692 2018-03-15 03:31:50 That’s a fact I like to add two drops of tea tree oil to mine also

8695 2018-03-15 03:31:22 I definitely agree w/ that thread. 
My tweet stemmed from a conversation.
We spoke on how Hover cars would require an inexpensive energy source that expels a lot of energy. But that tech isn't in the best interest of oil conglomerates even though it could be used for greater good

8709 2018-03-15 03:29:15 My eyes were burning so i simply put some coconut oil on a cute tip to remove any under eye makeup that eoukd have gotten in my eye from rubbing, then i took my lashes off & rubbed them. 30 minutes later I have a huge glob of shit formulating on my eyeballs omg. & it's growing!
8710 2018-03-15 03:28:42 Considering neither of the two guys pictured can do their job effectively, there is no correct answer to said question ;)
8711 2018-03-15 03:28:42 This Bot has 100 followers....dont give this loser a voice. Probably works for Saudi Arabia cause anyone with half a brain knows a pipeline is a much greener way to transport oil than train or truck. Something these liars never admit.
8712 2018-03-15 03:28:34 rogue police and “crude oil” . @PoliceMv
8713 2018-03-15 03:28:31 My lavender essential oil is running out. Why is this happeningggg
8714 2018-03-15 03:28:16 Touching up the presentation for #etc2018bkk: Conflict, Allergies, and Motor Oil.
8715 2018-03-15 03:28:05 We're not talking about that Anthony Weiner kind of love are we!?
8716 2018-03-15 03:27:57 luv me some baby lotion and baby oil
8717 2018-03-15 03:27:51 Stop teaching kids that they're all precious snowflakes with an absolute right to never be unhappy, and maybe they'll stop believing that their dissatisfaction JUSTIFIES killing their peers. Or.. ban guns, knives, fertilizer&fuel oil, poison&medicine, wire, rocks, water...
8718 2018-03-15 03:27:46 As oil weakened, the fracking sand demand decline, resulted in sand prices collapsing. Someone just following the glass end market would have missed the reason for the rise and subsequent fall. In any commodity, marginal buyer or seller sets price.
8719 2018-03-15 03:27:38 I hope that happens. Govt has saved enough in a) oil & gas subsidy b) direct transfer to beneficiaries in various scheme c) LED lights d) reduced corruption in central Govt etc.. now it is time pay back considering what voters needs to vote and Not citing past sin! @narendramodi
8720 2018-03-15 03:27:38 You can use a pump if they have it or in pill form some dogs dont like having to take pills so then you'll have to buy like pill pockets or whatever. Not human fish oil pills dog version.
8721 2018-03-15 03:27:31 Why stop there? How about some free payments, an oil change and a detail. Get lost buddy ha ha
8722 2018-03-15 03:27:29 Lemon juice helps but stay outa the sun or it darkens it. I tried Argan oil every night helps a ton also pure aloe Vera gel too
8723 2018-03-15 03:27:25 Coconut Oil is LIFE
8724 2018-03-15 03:27:17 Saddam was an evil man as quite frankly Blair turned out to be 
500,000 innocent Iraqis died during the invasion 
It was about Oil make no mistake. 
WMD was just a cover which got found out
8725 2018-03-15 03:27:04 HAHA went to Harris oil in my red robe and crocs, and was told “that’s the first person I’ve ever seen out here like that.” Hehe ya 
8726 2018-03-15 03:27:01 5 oil and bitumen tankers are in the Vancouver harbour everyday. These pipeline owners; Kinder Morgan and Trans; have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to an already large emergency fund.
8727 2018-03-15 03:26:55 "Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not..." ~Psalms 141:5
8728 2018-03-15 03:26:51 China can't be the only country. In market we need competitive prices and different quality. Maybe America can make stronger or better quality. Oil isn't the same in every country or even its quality. So why can't steel be the same?
8729 2018-03-15 03:26:38 It is analogous to the sand market in the US in 2012-2014. Most sand was used for glassmaking and other industrial applications, but a small and growing portion started being used for fracking oil. This skyrocketed sand prices thru 2014.
8730 2018-03-15 03:26:37 I might be an old lady but I love getting out the shower putting coconut oil all over my body putting socks on sitting on my couch and reading #thelife
8731 2018-03-15 03:26:16 Gas car manufacturers and oil tycoons have been predicting the demise of Tesla since day one. Reminds me of people that didn’t believe in Apple. You think Tesla is going down? I dare you to short sell.
8732 2018-03-15 03:26:08 Truth.
But, Why, so Much Low Self-Esteem? It Appears to be Getting Worse, Like Everything Else.
8733 2018-03-15 03:25:55 Someone remind me why Canadian oil is flowing south?  I bet China would love to have it
8734 2018-03-15 03:25:55 grabs coconut oil and a cotton pad, starts to take off my white and red face makeup, which i reapply every day cause i am a god damn clown
8735 2018-03-15 03:25:50 Good quality olive oil and salt. OXO Good Grips makes great quality utensils and non stick skillets at a reasonable price. Or just buy an America's Test Kitchen subscription and have them tell you everything. That's what I did.
8736 2018-03-15 03:25:41 We are more at the mercy to our corporate owners in this country. If Big Pharma/Oil/Wall-Street wanted your guns they would be gone already. They just let you keep your toys. Do you really think owning rifles are keeping the government in check? They have tanks, jets, drones!
8737 2018-03-15 03:25:27 The color 9 smells like money, very strong shades of crude oil with an undertone of Moscow. Just guessing. 
8738 2018-03-15 03:25:19 Kebanyakan barang dah beli. Tapi barang penting terlupa nak beli  pampers, baby wipe tissue, baby oil. Ayoyoyoyo........ harap baby pandai minta nak pergi toilet kalau nak popo or shishi 
8739 2018-03-15 03:25:19 Come on Emily! What kinda question that? Surely you are not serious! Take a walk through John R Wong and compare prices. Look especially at the whole & multigrain products, compared to plain ole white soft or hard dough bread for example. Extra virgin olive oil compared to others
8740 2018-03-15 03:25:19 Is it possible that Canadian oil is being purchased by US refiners/oil companies at a discount and sold back to Canada, primarily Ontario, at full world price?
8741 2018-03-15 03:25:14 When you bring you Prius to get a quick oil change but instead you get a story about zip lining in Brazil  #bitcoin
8742 2018-03-15 03:25:13 Hubby: "i'm going to get a beer (in the garage).  do you want anything?
Me:  "Yeah, I could use some motor oil".    LOL  What would I need from the garage at this time of night?!??!?!   At least he asked.
8743 2018-03-15 03:25:12 Taxpayers to pick up the rest - part of subsidy for oil- Christie assured future campaign donations.

8751 2018-03-15 03:23:18 Yup Diva, I'm seeing that 1st hand for the last 7 years with my son's education. The governor here is a joke. Paid for by oil, and is in her last term, so she doesn't give 2 shits about the working class. But it was better than when we were in GA. School was like Pump Up the Vol.
8752 2018-03-15 03:23:12 Tea tree oil helps with targeting acne but not scars! @koleendiaz_

8762 2018-03-15 03:21:45 Why is Canada exporting Western Canadian Select to the US at a 40 % discount and Canada is importing US oil at full West Texas Intermediate price?
8763 2018-03-15 03:21:43 His stupid father won’t let me anyways  he gives me such a hard time to do it but just mix the oils not that baby oil shit either and it will come back long & thick
8764 2018-03-15 03:21:37 Orange oil! Works great! Also gets gum out of your hair without cutting it.
8765 2018-03-15 03:21:15 If it’s oil base, it needs to be some type of distillate, water base.....well soap and water....
8766 2018-03-15 03:21:09 no she uses my rose hip oil & my moisturizer so
8767 2018-03-15 03:21:03 I, Hope so. It is so Weird "Out There", the Awful and, Genuinely Stupid things Peeps Say, to Others.

8770 2018-03-15 03:20:54 He once said the earth’s oil came from dinosaurs.
8771 2018-03-15 03:20:37 THIS is why I like Dale Jr! He isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty or paint in his hair. Hot water works if it’s water based. My dad was a painter. If it’s oil based a haircut may be in order!

No like black blood of the earth

8779 2018-03-15 03:18:59 Pete is as calm as Todd is when we're losing.  Sometimes you gotta let it out boys.  Show a little emotion!  You might just be surprised!  @Oil_Drop will agree I'm sure! :)

8782 2018-03-15 03:18:48 Kuczynski trajo a Hunt Oil al Perú y le hizo la parte financiera del proyecto de exportación de gas. Como asesor participó en el diseño de la empresa para solicitar el Lote 56 y luego, cuando regresó al gobierno como Premier el 2004, le entregó el lote para la exportación.
8783 2018-03-15 03:18:46 Ginger ale and Essential oils... oil treating my hair overnight... relaxation or whatever
8784 2018-03-15 03:18:30 As it was Israel and the main meal was served in a cafeteria, it's likely Atkins was high in soy oil and the Med diet was lower omega-6.

8786 2018-03-15 03:18:15 Cocokind’s Turmeric Stick does wonders—tea tree oil is super fast acting as well (you can get Elf’s tea tree stick at Target). If you need it ASAP, TOOTHPASTE. Leave it on like a spot treatment for like a half hour. Repeat in the morning. #cysticacneforever
8787 2018-03-15 03:18:03 turpenoid and linseed oil? Where do I buy that at?
8788 2018-03-15 03:18:03 You so called security guys are nothing but morons. Evil BIOS can basically kill any system in the world. But you guys are marketing your snake oil for your claim to fame. Find some real bugs like Spectre, Meltdown etc... This is just like Chaos which also required root.
8789 2018-03-15 03:17:52 Walked to my bathroom w my oil diffuser and my mom low key discovered that I’m about to smoke. #sorrynotsorry ? “No I just wanna relaxxxx” lol
8790 2018-03-15 03:17:47 "Just wait." He chef chuckled as he grabbed a special oil and poured it inside the tower.
"The onions are still raw on the inside." He then got a lighter and lit the top of the onion tower and made a little volcano with fire spewing out from the top.
8791 2018-03-15 03:17:44 مش هترحمك 
8792 2018-03-15 03:17:43 And his campaigning and photo op what's that have to do with Nafta. The oil and gas employ over 200k Canadians from coast to coast to coast and he is will to have them All gone!
8793 2018-03-15 03:17:36 Did they sneek the gun bill alongside the CBD oil bill.
8794 2018-03-15 03:17:33 Mixed some tee tree oil in my coconut oil and now my mom is saying i have the whole house smelling like Dominican Republic 
8795 2018-03-15 03:17:01 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a non-GMO diet, and put some musk essential oil in my diffuser.

I take care of myself basically, but.. if you ever pay attention to my nails or hands, they will be dirty 80% of the time. I’m sorry but try getting oil based paints.. all kinds of silicones and other bs off every day.
8798 2018-03-15 03:16:36 Does that hairnet prevent the oil from this greaseball's hair from contaminating this food?
8799 2018-03-15 03:16:27 I don't think any of us Oil fans criticizing Lucic want to be right. I also wish nothing more than that I had been wrong about the Hall and Eberle trades being bad. But I'm not gonna butter Oilers management or players asses up when they deserve the criticism
8800 2018-03-15 03:16:18 I would think the oil are looking at Hoffman
8801 2018-03-15 03:15:59 you mean the same formula that he, as part of the Federal Conservatives, passed? 

also, his commentary is more of a condemnation of past PC governments who under-taxed and over-spent the oil glut for decades, rather than a problem w/ the formula.

8802 2018-03-15 03:15:58 Hi buddy
What is view on. Oil ?
8803 2018-03-15 03:15:51 i just saw an oil of olay commercial with a very beautiful DARK skinned woman and it made me smile, tired of seeing all these white girls in hygiene product advertisements.
8804 2018-03-15 03:15:50 Coconut oil makes the hair soft the paint should slide right off!
8805 2018-03-15 03:15:48 Yadda yadda, windbag dinosaur. We are the future, the past, and the outside of time. The Fifth is ours completely, you're just a stain between dimensions like an oil spill soon to be wiped.

8809 2018-03-15 03:15:29 SJ and EDM trade goals in the period and we head to the second intermission all square at 2-2. Sharks out-shoot the Oil 18-6 in the period, but as the score can attest, lots of shots are meaningless if you don't bury them.
8810 2018-03-15 03:15:26 If u just used the brushes just wipe the brush in your hand with soap & water, if the paint is dry u need turpenoid and linseed oil

8828 2018-03-15 03:12:55 Fossil fuels aren't 'horrible'. But it is time (past time actually) to start phasing them out. Expanding the oil patch is the worst thing we can do. Like you, I have grandchildren. I'm deeply concerned for their future.

8836 2018-03-15 03:11:51 I seriously wonder how much you’ve stolen from the Treasury alone. And now members of your own administration can also moonlight to make more money in oil.

You’re devoid of ethics. And economics is definitely not your strong suit, if you even have a strength
8837 2018-03-15 03:11:43 Or when they are all: This recipe is amazeballs! I substituted butter for olive oil, sugar for salt, and baked it instead of broiled it. Delicious!

(Funny - I was going to make a similar post earlier, but I got distracted trying not to burn dinner while playing HQ.)

8843 2018-03-15 03:10:50 I did a hair mask and an oil and then I did my entire skincare routine. I am thriving. I am one single glow. I am so soft. I've never been more alive.
8844 2018-03-15 03:10:28 My brain just read it as "Three Billboards Outside Ya Boi Missouri, Back At It Again" please dump me in a vat of boiling oil.

8848 2018-03-15 03:10:08 black soap, coconut oil, and the grace of god
8849 2018-03-15 03:10:05 Sounds more like snake oil than sound policy - all benefits, no costs or tradeoffs?
8850 2018-03-15 03:09:49 why didn’t I think to put tea tree oil in mine  .. you putting me on smh
8851 2018-03-15 03:09:25  he doesn’t do anything. I oil his scalp with Jamaican Castor Oil from time to time. 
8852 2018-03-15 03:09:13 More like “go home snake oil salesmen”, but I couldn’t agree more! Go Rams.
8853 2018-03-15 03:09:06 Russia already sold afrin for oil and s-400 deal with Turkey. Don't expect Russia to help and I hope the Kurds never trust them again.
8854 2018-03-15 03:08:49 my mom really out here rubbing olive oil on my leg like the arab she is
8855 2018-03-15 03:08:49 A few more years of Climate Change and those glaciers will be gone.  South Alberta is going to be a desert.  Fights over water are going to get a lot more serious too.  The oil patch also depends on that water.
8856 2018-03-15 03:08:17 !!! Hallelujah !!!  !!!
8857 2018-03-15 03:08:16 As soon as I get paid I have to go get my oil changed which really makes me sad. I’m already getting paid half as much because of spring break and now of course I have to throw a lot of it away for my car 
8858 2018-03-15 03:08:10 Aw thank you boo! I use the clear Ecostyler gel & coconut oil! And the creme of nature edge control for my baby hairs 
8859 2018-03-15 03:07:59 To trigger a response from you then surely you are still under the thinking that we should stop our oilfield development. How bout a statement on how important our oil sector is to this province and is necessary to our economic well being and you fully advocate future development

8861 2018-03-15 03:07:18 If you’re buying a car from a dealership and you really believe those oil changes are for free I feel bad for you tbh te chingaron
8862 2018-03-15 03:06:53 What is the brand name of the oil you always use in your hand? 

#JuicyfiedGirlKathAnswers
8863 2018-03-15 03:06:26 No, it should be oil rich dictators only who get the privilige. 

How about Northern Cyprus or Taiwan?When did your brain stop working. 
It might be "nifti" if the brain is "efgone"
8864 2018-03-15 03:06:12 So why not advocate for Nuclear energy if serious about ending dependence on fossil fuels? Renewables and nuclear together will end dependence on Coal, gas and oil.
Solar panels on your roof isn’t enough (Tokenism)
8865 2018-03-15 03:06:01 12.7%. I don’t mind it. But taxes are being raised on regular people and oil & gas industry still slides by.

8877 2018-03-15 03:04:44 vape oil. Please I must see
8878 2018-03-15 03:04:35 My parents did not let me get a car as a teenager until I could do all those things INCLUDING changing my own oil....AND I had to pay my own insurance

8880 2018-03-15 03:04:19 Yeah. I can’t do the oil any more. You are what you eat

8882 2018-03-15 03:04:08 I've ran out of tea tree oil for my diffuser 
8883 2018-03-15 03:04:08 Thanks, but I change my oil myself. 
8884 2018-03-15 03:04:07 How do you know its fake?
8885 2018-03-15 03:04:02 Jon says the maintenence light just means you need an oil change, etc...No heat means it's flipping cold out. Check your battery and your heater core.
8886 2018-03-15 03:03:54 I use a blend by Burt’s Bees and follow that with Maracuja oil. At night, I use a night time blend by Aura Cacia and follow that with more Maracuja. Love that stuff.

8888 2018-03-15 03:03:30 Except for not having oil, rest apply to Finland as well. Ethnic homogeneity has a big role in reducing ethnic strife and trying to compare Finland to a great social experiment going in USA will never be possible.
8889 2018-03-15 03:03:30 anybody an artist and know how to clean oil paint from brushes?
8890 2018-03-15 03:03:24 want to be both people in that junji ito panel with the face oil
8891 2018-03-15 03:03:04 A very nice observation and I take your point.

The only thing I'll add here is that a gallon of gas would cost $15 a gallon if big oil suppliers had their way. It doesn't because of regulations. 

Everyone wants to live in a lake house. That doesn't mean everyone should.
8892 2018-03-15 03:02:29 Coconut oil and my bath and body works got my skin feeling and smelling good 
8893 2018-03-15 03:02:26 too bad @IndyCar denied him the win. #fakeracing . support @imsa instead where there's real racing and consistent rules

8897 2018-03-15 03:01:32 today this lady came to automotive & asked me what was the difference in the type of oil changes we do & what other service it includes & then i started explaining & she got mad & called me useless & she ended up getting the wrong oil change service lol  #sorrynotsorry
8898 2018-03-15 03:01:30 Sad. The Dumbing-Up of Our Country, is Staggering !!!
8899 2018-03-15 03:01:22 Or just rub baby oil all over the top.
8900 2018-03-15 03:01:22 The only thing i change in my routine is when i use oil cleanser i have to wipe it off with a damp cloth because i don’t wanna get oil on my lashes!! But i sleep on my side & it’s fine & i wear all makeup except mascara!! I try to avoid waterproof tho bc it’s hard to remove
8901 2018-03-15 03:01:18 Quick tip: Olive oil can remove stains on your fingertips from stainless steel! #healthtips #lifehack #diy

8903 2018-03-15 03:00:54 I seem to remember hearing all this before the 2014 vote, you lost then by 10% when the price of oil was well above a hundred dollars and before massive job losses in the North East.
8904 2018-03-15 03:00:34 Shea butter and coconut oil got my skin feeling lovely
8905 2018-03-15 03:00:25 But honestly, that's like allowing a oil rich dictator to manipulate international laws to punish those escaping his rule.
8906 2018-03-15 03:00:21 Females shouldn’t be intimidated going into an auto shop or fear getting taken advantage of! Learn shit about your car so you have basic knowledge! Know how to check oil and fluid levels, know how to fill your tires, know how to change a flat!!
8907 2018-03-15 03:00:16 OIL DIFF: 3.96 -> 3.99

8909 2018-03-15 03:00:07 Yeah, that's a head scratcher. Rex may have residual relationships from his oil executive days. He is diplomatically naive.

8915 2018-03-15 02:58:56 @realDonaldTrump For me to see a definite benefit to everybody is a reduction in the cost of fuel. We are suppose to be out of influence of foriegn oil, so why are we paying like we still are. It should be ...
8916 2018-03-15 02:58:53 Got coconut oil but no woman's pretty feet to rub them on
8917 2018-03-15 02:58:47 Lemon Essential Oil :) 
8918 2018-03-15 02:58:35 But the aims are different. Back then, it was about oil. Now it's about containing the Corbyn heresy. Russia is just a prop.
8919 2018-03-15 02:58:29 I love business, olive oil and pizza. Fortunately my passion for the first one means no matter what I’m doing as long as it doesn’t have a ceiling I will enjoy it.
8920 2018-03-15 02:58:26 I saw some nice beard oil in the store and was bout to buy then realized I don’t have a bae so who can tf was I bout to buy it for? 
8921 2018-03-15 02:58:23 Cause the fix is in. But don’t get to too excited with the stupid way the playoff are done now, they will be out first round. That is 5 more playoff games than the Oil this year though.
8922 2018-03-15 02:58:10 Baby oil, no matter what kind of paint. Or WD40.
8923 2018-03-15 02:58:03 I tried everything too! I got a huge yoga ball and bounced on that for a few days. Tried primrose oil but nothing worked for me  I ended up being induced at 40weeks
8924 2018-03-15 02:57:42 And a smidge of burnt rubber. Plus some of Ryan’s engine oil and who knows what from the sportsman
8925 2018-03-15 02:57:36 Truffle oil is slang for heroin

8928 2018-03-15 02:56:54 Finally got my vitamin c serum and rose hip oil, my skin is about to be glowinggggg 
8929 2018-03-15 02:56:53 Yeah.  Hard to see a Canucks win.  

Oil could do a huge favor.  Hate cheering for them though. But it has to be done.
8930 2018-03-15 02:56:53 !!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL !!!
Is it Usually Leftists Making those Racist Comments, as it is in CA?
8931 2018-03-15 02:56:52 if you do don’t forget the oil
8932 2018-03-15 02:56:32 Ooo you forgot to block me as well! Censorship, censorship! Please block me like you block everyone else that doesn't align to your snake oil salesman beliefs. 'News'... Hahahaha BTC News at that? I think you're having an identity crisis.
8933 2018-03-15 02:56:25 Jacob- “no i think that’s oil Matthew”
8934 2018-03-15 02:56:20 I wanted to buy one eye shadow pallet & talked into buying two pallets, 5 lip sticks, 3 lip glosses, falsies, & cuticle oil . No one tell Josh 
8935 2018-03-15 02:56:12 Do this oil
8936 2018-03-15 02:56:00 No I was thinking how I could fuck a porn star after my illegal alien wife gave birth to my son and pay her off become best buds with da Russians and become the best snake oil salesman of all time
8937 2018-03-15 02:55:56 Change oil
8938 2018-03-15 02:55:23 Russia has been working in Arctic for yrs now as they know as we do thats where a lot of Oil is! They want to drill there same as we do! So this will be interesting!
8939 2018-03-15 02:54:58 Imagine me getting rid of my plants & oil diffuser because of Feng Shui. First of all, I’m not even Chinese so bump that. I loveeee my room.

8943 2018-03-15 02:54:30 He is...Though he gets tired of being called a Mexican just as much as I do...Seriously people...Just because our skin is darker than you but lighter than the black folks...We aren't Hispanics... We're Native Americans...Quit speaking Spanish at us..
8944 2018-03-15 02:54:29 Well then.

8946 2018-03-15 02:54:03 I’m running the Chinkin Oil Change Special tomorrow at the Jiffy Lube in wolfchase  HMU for oil changes. 
8947 2018-03-15 02:53:57 Don't forget it was Vlad who wanted Tillerson because of his ties with his former company. It was the biggest oil deal IN THE WORLD.  Still is if they can get out of sanctions.
8948 2018-03-15 02:53:55 What's that? A small pool of oil in the garage underneath my car? Awesome! 
8949 2018-03-15 02:53:54 But there’s the lucas Oil Stadium

8952 2018-03-15 02:53:46 lemon+olive oil+ peppercorn is the best dressing. I would use it all over my body
8953 2018-03-15 02:53:41 No more coconut oil ever. The worst thing you could ever eat.
8954 2018-03-15 02:53:40 No I'm thinking about a puck starter kit.... Shark plushie, edible glitter, several grey digimon shirts, oil paint, a black cat, sensible but stylish shoes, leather jacket, black lipstick
8955 2018-03-15 02:53:35 Hi there. So...oil is currently pumping thru the Standing Rock Reservation I'm reading. Are there still people in the jail that was built once people were arrested.I met many homeless folks who thought it would be FUN to join the party.
8956 2018-03-15 02:53:25 Coconut oil before re-bleaching hair... it’s nice to smell like exotic popped corn; it’s weird to feel so greasy.
8957 2018-03-15 02:53:18 Because OEA wants $10,000. It’s time to make a stand! Stop giving the oil companies what they want.
8958 2018-03-15 02:53:12 Depends on the state. Still irrelevant as driving isn't a right.
8959 2018-03-15 02:52:56 Shit I washed Saturday but it still felt oiliy so I’m do a  Apple cider vinegar rinse, olive oil condition,  plus wash this weekend ... how long for you ?
8960 2018-03-15 02:52:54 Nothing lile burning the midnight oil to get builds that are custom cerakoted out as quick as possible to our customers! 
8961 2018-03-15 02:52:51 My doctor said castor oil does more harm than good! It's possible to take too much and make babies have a bowel movement before they are born which can be harmful since they will ingest it
8962 2018-03-15 02:52:48 40分も歩くとスシローで食べた寿司もイオンで飲んだ甘い飲み物もゼロカロリーです！
8963 2018-03-15 02:52:36 Also, goal was scored on the glove side… Didn’t interfere with his ability to make the save regardless
8964 2018-03-15 02:52:28 *brapppppp   *BANG    ....oil everywhere.....
8965 2018-03-15 02:52:24 Yea I’ve heard about people putting cooking oil in it. Can’t relate to the animal poop or snow thing though
8966 2018-03-15 02:52:04 we make something similar to be had with curd rice. it's basically whole red chilly, tamarind, salt and shallots drizzled with coconut oil, pounded a little and mashed with hand. the red chillies need to soak in the moisture/oil and break.
8967 2018-03-15 02:51:55 Can someone come wash my hair? 

&& deep condition && detangle && give me a hot oil treatment? I’ll suck yo di....
8968 2018-03-15 02:51:52 I would say cut coconut oil face lotion. Coconut oil contrary to popular belief really isn’t good for your face it isn’t non comedegenic (meaning it clogs the pores)  vitamin e oil is basically a strong antioxidant so safe. And scrubbing every day can over process the skin
8969 2018-03-15 02:51:46 No better feeling when you shave your legs and then apply coconut oil 
8970 2018-03-15 02:51:40 かんっぺき！
8971 2018-03-15 02:51:37 excuse me while i go serve my brother eviction papers for trying to serve me undercooked hasbrowns in an oil sauce
8972 2018-03-15 02:51:27 There are lots of useful vitamins and other nutrients in the roasted brussels sprouts i just devoured.  Salt and olive oil.  Roast on parchment paper on baking sheet at 400F degrees until tender and brown. No quiz!
8973 2018-03-15 02:51:23 Open your eyes. 8-1-17 "Devon Energy Corp. generated a profit of $425 million in the second quarter as oil and natural gas production exceeded expectations while costs were lower than expected, the company said Tuesday." QUARTERLY!!! in a1/4 a fiscal year.
8974 2018-03-15 02:51:22 おっはこんにちはー

8975 2018-03-15 02:51:17 I got some new melts for my oil burners they smell so good
8976 2018-03-15 02:50:58 I tried the wipes but they weren’t as good as I thought. I’m gonna try just the oil stuff

8978 2018-03-15 02:50:40 *day 29 of whole 30*
Me: feels better than ever, has loads of energy, obsessed w/ coconut oil + almond butter
Also me: is currently wearing underwear w/ hamburgers on them

Not a joke. Ask @mckennatucker , she bought them. 
8979 2018-03-15 02:50:32 Once again, you're leaning on flat past demand, which is what that article you pointed to was about. Then you ignore the coming switch for a big chunk of energy demand from oil to electricity, and pretend that demand will stay flat. It won't, and even the piece alludes to it
8980 2018-03-15 02:50:31 Not sure. It will be hauled out of there by truck and taken to a rail loading facility and then shipped by train to somewhere that oil or gas is being brought out of the ground.
8981 2018-03-15 02:50:13 Diapers. Mini trash bags. I pour my cooking oil in them to throw it away. Picking up animal poop. Covering your shoes in the snow. Etc etc
8982 2018-03-15 02:50:09 just some things I do, since I'm allergic to so many things, oil pulling helps draw out toxins, aspirin for breaking the fever, heating pads/hot baths to cook the illness out, and chicken soup with garlic and parsley to help build immune system. Hope you feel better soon sir!
8983 2018-03-15 02:50:00 So when you need to renew your drivers license you NEVER need to see an eye doctor before the DMV gives you a new ID?
8984 2018-03-15 02:49:58 If you are suffering from cancer please give cannabis oil a go. I don't mean the CBD oil from shops I Mean pure oil using the rick Simpson method. My mum is in remission after only 8 months. If you need any questions answered mail me. #StandUpToCancer

8987 2018-03-15 02:49:41 Because Saudi oil funds Canadian healthcare?
8988 2018-03-15 02:49:40 No it is a slap in the face. Raise the GPT back to 7% and restore funding to education. Why is Oil more important than our education.
8989 2018-03-15 02:49:36 Yeah, but...when did #okleg ever care what teachers had to say. It's not like they're full of oil.
8990 2018-03-15 02:49:23 coconut oil is doing wonders on my skin & hair especially my hair
8991 2018-03-15 02:49:05 i actually used to use tea tree oil but it stopped working after awhile. idk 
8992 2018-03-15 02:49:00 I had peppermint oil on my hands then I touched my face and it burns and my eyes keep tearing up RIP
8993 2018-03-15 02:48:58 The list goes on for a while...
8994 2018-03-15 02:48:57 And i got this essential oil braclet that i wear daily that releases this scent and it helps with headaches and migraines!!! hope you feel better tho :))
8995 2018-03-15 02:48:54 I bet I don't use 50
8996 2018-03-15 02:48:42 My dad taught me important lesson growing up...I made a list (kinda like "Gibb's rules")
1. Never trust a man in a dress
2. Never take advice from a person with a face tattoo (they make poor life choices)
3. Never trust a man with a table cloth on their head.
8997 2018-03-15 02:48:41 Good Night and, Sweet Dreams, Miss Nix 
8998 2018-03-15 02:48:33 The Klefn'bom!
Keep it up Oil!
8999 2018-03-15 02:48:33 That’ll work—tear down every American flag in the country—hand in hand with confiscating firearms.
So what do we get? Another Tim McVeigh buys a lot of fertilizer & diesel fuel....and oh...now you want to confiscate all fertilizer and fuel oil?
Try arming officers in schools

9009 2018-03-15 02:47:39 My eye doc said to add more flax to my diet to help w/dry eyes. Switching from soy to flax milk on my cereal was enough for me. I'd also bought some flax oil to add to smoothies but since the milk was enough I give the oil to my pets as a treat [they love it; they're weird, lol].
9010 2018-03-15 02:47:32 Klefbom finds a seam and it's 2-1 Oil. So much for the Sharks "controlling the offense".

Tasting like baked goods
Have you wanting more ...

9013 2018-03-15 02:47:19 If you already have oily skin you shouldn’t put coconut oil on it because it’ll clog your pores and make it worse
9014 2018-03-15 02:47:11 I've covered about a dozen butane honey oil lab explosions over the years (mostly in Butte County). In fact, wrote an article dedicated to what they are and why they're so dangerous and destructive. A simple turn of a switch can ignite those gases.

9017 2018-03-15 02:46:51 iSwear I was just saying that I need to buy some conditioner, but no I’m tryna let it dry before I put the coconut oil in my head
9018 2018-03-15 02:46:48 well i have oily skin , & after i take my makeup off, i use coconut oil & then w a foaming cleanser i go over the coconut oil on my face then wash it all off w coconut water & thats helped alot. Also if you have lil pimples, put a lil bit of rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball
9019 2018-03-15 02:46:38 That's why I gotta play rain sounds and drink sleepy time tea and take dormicum.

Oil got me in a choke hold.

9024 2018-03-15 02:45:33 on the oil rig i worked on, we had near misses all the time, but no incident investigation, "just part of the job" until someone's arm was torn off by machinery in an accident which could easily have been prevented. covfefe

9027 2018-03-15 02:45:07 i got an idea for a cool oil painting in my dream last night now i'm going to spend all day wanting to put it on canvas
9028 2018-03-15 02:44:51 stupid fur baby got his tail in my oil paints!!!
9029 2018-03-15 02:44:48 My obsession with facial oils is at an all-time high. I want to add an oil cleanser to my regimen. I want additive-free skin care, I don’t even use cream moisturizer anymore.
9030 2018-03-15 02:44:45 Try dish detergent to lift the oil first, then club soda, or a spot cleaner of your choice for the color
9031 2018-03-15 02:44:32 Quit talking and take action. It's now or later and you can not afford later. All Embargos start Monday the 19th. Make them react. Tell Trudeau no carbon tax until pipeline is cleared and back by the government and all foreign oil is carbon taxed.
9032 2018-03-15 02:44:13 The @CPC_HQ did such a diservice to Alberta and the oil sand industry. What would Sheer do to ensure that this industry can thrive by keeping both Cndns concerned about the environment and Cndns concerned about selling to world markets happy?

9035 2018-03-15 02:44:00 i treated myself with 3/4 bottles of red wine, a face mask, and rosehip body oil today. sometimes you gotta treat yourself right cause the world won’t

9039 2018-03-15 02:43:53 Big difference between 'hosting' and actually taking in refugees, that in a region where oil and money is more abundant than the sand it sits under in the neighbouring countries all with the same Sharia laws these refugees are accustomed to. But yet you grill Australia.
9040 2018-03-15 02:43:50 Legally there is nothing to stop this. All countries declaring Independence in modern times just did so. The issue is Scotland’s oil is used to prop up the UK and that’s why Eng politicians shitting themselves.
9041 2018-03-15 02:43:50 If I smell the truffle oil, I won’t eat the food. Must be reaaaally subtle

9049 2018-03-15 02:42:51 Oil or latex? Oil...you are SOL. Latex...either super hot water and roll it btwn your fingers from scalp to  ends or let it dry and put it btwn your fingernails and pull like stripping a wire.
9050 2018-03-15 02:42:40 Today I bought new clothes and beard oil and I could feel @tanfrance and @jvn’s energy of approval as I stunted out of the mall.
9051 2018-03-15 02:42:31 They are pushing very hard.  Elites sit on all of the main corporate boards.  They could stop drilling - Standard Oil (Rockefeller) stop cutting the Rain Forest, Stop mining Rare Earth, Stop Wars Immediately.  Their AGENDA-Destruction of Everything except themselves
9052 2018-03-15 02:42:18 Ironically, higher oil prices are better for Houston, but not the rest of the country.  We grapple with this dilemma every day at United!
9053 2018-03-15 02:42:15 It is when trump must obey his master and bring back coal and oil.
9054 2018-03-15 02:42:10 They don't want me....I'm to technical, i comprehend the oil rigs equipment, the groundwater table, the safety.  to blunt spoken, proud steward of the land, and little patience with hypocrites.
9055 2018-03-15 02:42:02 baby oil
9056 2018-03-15 02:41:40 Yes, the benefits of cheap oil have spread far and wide. Imagine how many more could have escaped poverty if we had a system that didn't increase inequality and rewarded hard work fairly. And imagine if we didn't waste so much wealth on militarism either!
9057 2018-03-15 02:41:28 Every bottle of Olive Oil is Extra Virgin when I use it
9058 2018-03-15 02:41:20 Carrot seed oil smells ungodly
9059 2018-03-15 02:41:08 These oil industry apologists are happy to pipe toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic material through someone else's backyard.  Well screw that.

9062 2018-03-15 02:40:51 Regarding the latest incident allegedly carried out by Russia in England, we can forget European support as even the EUFA are sponsored by the Russian Oil giant Gazprom.
9063 2018-03-15 02:40:35 Ask yourselves: who stands to benefit from a population who don't believe in ourselves?

Hint: it's the people who sell Jesus-brand snake oil.

Jesus himself threw the money-changers out of the temple for blaspheming. This dude is just short-changing rubes who come to worship.

9069 2018-03-15 02:40:16 I don't qualify if Rex's departure is positive or negative based on his skills or world view. Instead, the change of policy moving forward may have substantial impact on global oil supply and prices

Limited upwards oil price movement can be good for America, Houston, & Texas

9073 2018-03-15 02:40:04 Part 1 Thanks for writing it and mentioning the oil embargo with Japan.  The oil embargo was done to bring about war with Japan because USA wanted a war with Hitler in Europe.  USA new an attack against USA would take place by Japan.  Did not prepare properly for Pearl Harbor.

9097 2018-03-15 02:36:55 For many heavy #industrial sectors in that chart they were impacted by the oil and gas crash, so no funds to invest in #DigitalTransformation. Also they are very slow historically to adopt new tech like #bigdata #analytics. They are now!

9128 2018-03-15 02:32:50 You do realize zero manufacturers would jump on with this right? opec works because, every human NEEDS oil to survive. All one would need to do is wait a year before it disbanned due to loss in profits and sales. It's not a functioning model. What idiot thought this was smart?

9141 2018-03-15 02:32:20 Yes @JustinTrudeau , I intend to remind you of the risks you are taking in B.C,... each and every time there is an oil spill. There is no such thing as ACCEPTABLE environmental risk.

9177 2018-03-15 02:27:07 I have been using the copaiba essential oil off and on for a few years, but really just was blown away by it in the last 6 months science wise, and started using it far more effectively. Topically and internally.

9183 2018-03-15 02:26:23 I have traded in adventurous snowboarding weekends this winter for climbing into bed early after using olbas oil, raw garlic, and sudafed. I'll get used to it, right @SpaceCadetYarn ?

9198 2018-03-15 02:24:49 Taking the car to the mechanic to get the engine looked at. Always check the oil level, kids. Don't be an idiot and ignore the 'oil maintenance' light in your car because you're lazy.

9238 2018-03-15 02:19:22 If we can afford to give billions in subsidies to oil companies, leftover from the 1920's when we wanted to encourage oil exploration, and a military parade for tRump's ego, then we can afford to take care of our veterans AND active duty and families.
9239 2018-03-15 02:19:20 I can not go without lotion or oil. My skin starts doing weird shit.

9244 2018-03-15 02:19:01 I don’t typically interact much on here, so indulge me, please, as I realize the unsolicited responses get annoying... but. I had always figured Tillerson was chosen to navigate this Syria pipeline proxy oil/gas backhanded war. Which has worked so far.

9247 2018-03-15 02:18:36 hey, better Saudi Arabia wastes lots of money on a spaceplane than on oil subsidies or general shitty human rights behaviors!

9269 2018-03-15 02:16:38 It’s military spending is comparable to Saudi Arabia. It’s exports are mostly limited to oil and gas.  It’s GDP per person is 40% of the US, and its population is 40% of the US. 40% x 40% = 16%
9270 2018-03-15 02:16:32 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

9273 2018-03-15 02:16:16 The headline misses the personal request by Dr Carson to have a $25,000 oil portrait painted of himself to display outside his office. With taxpayer money. Un-freaking-believable.

9284 2018-03-15 02:15:07 LMAO SOFI YES EXACTLY

yeah i feel you. wish they didn't go for a murder mystery thing, if in the end they wanted to value for /how he lived/, what was all that whole searching for, and the oil paintings would suit something, another thing rather than being Another van gogh story
9285 2018-03-15 02:15:06 It is the anointing of the oil that covers me and by the blood of Jesus I have been set free indeed. I will pursue and recover all.
9286 2018-03-15 02:14:48 I have a good friend with it. She’s a big fan of smoking pot for it. She says it’s amazing for the pain. I know not everyone is into that. But it’s helped her more than other meds. CBD oil helps too
9287 2018-03-15 02:14:43 Noxzema & vitamin e oil.
9288 2018-03-15 02:14:42 Hell yeah I can help with that! I’ve got coconut oil we can coat your hair with before we put the bleach on as well!
9289 2018-03-15 02:14:31 Oil, gold, strawberries all require proof of work. If you eat anything proof of work is what keeps you alive.
9290 2018-03-15 02:14:26 You do realize that you are setting the stage for oil lobbyists and security contractors to declare you, me, and the rest of the environmental movement "Putin stooges" brainwashed by his dastardly bots into opposing a "pro-American" energy strategy (oil/gas/coal), right?
9291 2018-03-15 02:14:20 6yrs left vs 2.  Oil would need a lot more coming back. Plus age difference

9307 2018-03-15 02:11:49 Well if John D. Rockefeller can stumble across oil and become the richest man in history, then I guess a fair share of greatness will come to everyone someday.

9315 2018-03-15 02:10:58 Please some liberal tell me how we’re saving the planet by burning Saudi oil in Canada. I’m waiting. Also how we’re saving our marine environment by having tankers dock & offload Saudi oil.
9316 2018-03-15 02:10:57 The Oklahoma Senate is expected to take up a $450M revenue package tonight that includes tax hikes on cigs, fuel and oil/gas production to fund a 12.7% teacher pay increase.
9317 2018-03-15 02:10:52 Senate Bill 52, CBD oil bill, passes the Indiana House 97-0, just a short time after the Indiana Senate passed the bill. It now heads to @GovHolcomb

9323 2018-03-15 02:10:25 And yes, I saw who made that great pass on the Oilers first goal.  Could be a gordie Howe tonight
9324 2018-03-15 02:10:19 Okay I will show you. How much of that money goes to have middle class home owners convert their oil heat to solar or wind? If this is part of this program explain how one goes about receiving the cash grants.
9325 2018-03-15 02:10:16 Endless oil story

9328 2018-03-15 02:09:33 Pruitt has nothing to hang his hat on . . . he's not bright.
Suing the EPA multiple times attracted Trump attention, led to his nomination . . .  
Oil companies kept him afloat politically in OK . . .
His potential appointment to AG is as accidental as Trump's presidency.
9329 2018-03-15 02:09:33 I have the same issue with my 6 yr old.. been reading into cbd oil for kids in gummies.
9330 2018-03-15 02:09:27 We were the world's largest oil producer when you came into office thanks to Obama's shale oil policy. Your so lame that you're trying to take credit for Obama's success
9331 2018-03-15 02:09:03 “So how do you feel about the plot?”
“...

9332 2018-03-15 02:08:58 Yeah and that's why we have contaminated water, cancers, respiratory diseases, hundreds of spills, oil rig explosions, tanker spills, dead marine mammals, decline in fish, shrimp, oysters, etc. WTF??? YOU are DELUSIONAL!!!
9333 2018-03-15 02:08:50 he is pretending to support blue collar workers .... just like he pretended to support oil workers, but has yet to do anything concrete
9334 2018-03-15 02:08:48 Lucic - did I just hear Howie Meeker say “he couldn’t put the puck in the ocean off the pier”.    I miss Howie.
9335 2018-03-15 02:08:45 With what he’s done for the oil industry he should be in jail
9336 2018-03-15 02:08:43 Not really just in a competition with hubby as to who achieves the 8 pack first and I’m loosing so far lol

9339 2018-03-15 02:08:19 I feel for farmers in Brazil but we have the rail in place for the very reason of transporting Canada's commodities be that grain, oil or other I do not see a reason to move backwards when we have a system in place that works as long as they are forced into accountability.
9340 2018-03-15 02:08:16 On your face lol remember we were talking about coconut oil being heavy as hell
9341 2018-03-15 02:08:09 Cool. Profit off of tobacco, oil and war, don't pay your fair share in taxes, so that ordinary Illinoisans struggle to eat, and then set up a tax-deductible "charity" that allows them to *buy* the healthy food that they could have afforded if the rich paid their fair share. 
9342 2018-03-15 02:08:09 You’re still at it lol you’re heating melting chocolate and adding ingredients + decarbed oil.  Just like I pack weed in a tube and turn valves.  Science is a stretch boiling water is “science” we’re selling drugs end of the day.

9394 2018-03-15 02:02:14 This referendum was never to conclude independence but  KRG thought through people mandate they would hold stronger cards in settling disputes in kirkuk and over oil and other things. We saw that wasnt the case after losing on october 16

9420 2018-03-15 02:00:24 Some differences between Petro and other cryptocurrencies are:
- Petro is centralized, that is, it is the first currency launched by the government of a country.
-It is not clear if this cryptocurrency offers the buyer barrels of oil or bolivars based on the price of oil.

9434 2018-03-15 01:59:31 How could you feed oil to fire, doing it for the excitement and the drama? Knowing people could get hurt?
9435 2018-03-15 01:59:31 I think Shell Oil did it, too.  There were lawsuits but it didn't make much difference.  Noticeable drop in quality service from those organizations.  A lot of those fired were WWII vets who returned from war & took jobs w/'good' companies.... promised big benefits.
9436 2018-03-15 01:59:10 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)

9490 2018-03-15 01:51:14 I read this & immediately looked up recipes. The best review I’ve seen yet is a 1 star review someone gave a salmon recipe because she bought knock off stainless steel pans, cooked the salmon, and ruined the pan from using olive oil & medium heat.  “the salmon was good though.”

9514 2018-03-15 01:47:16 I personally would prefer they offset the entire wells-to-atmosphere amount, but what I was saying is that at min Canada needs Paris-approved offsets for any expansion of oil and gas emissions inside canada at this point. It's the primary driver of climate failure in Canada.

9581 2018-03-15 01:35:40 This daylight savings crap has thrown off my sleep schedule, so I started using lavender in my new oil diffuser the past 2 nights and it has been a life saver!
9582 2018-03-15 01:35:40 When y’all need oil for your car do you just get a oil change or do yall just buy oil??

9587 2018-03-15 01:35:01 I have been saying this forever, Hyperloop is snake oil, they are selling it without actually solving the real engineering problems. Both the top companies seem to be interested in making train coaches which is not very useful.

9594 2018-03-15 01:33:36 the search for oil and gas is obviously detrimental to the environment, but who knew how much harm the sonic waves used could do. #noisepollution #ees028
9595 2018-03-15 01:33:35 I like Oil Changers because I don’t have to get out of the car and they clean my windows

9605 2018-03-15 01:32:05 Lo Siento didn’t mean it that way. Just that as you get older your eye sight gets checked in order to renew your license.
9606 2018-03-15 01:32:04 I'd like this opportunity to sincerely thank Mr. Prince for his efforts on my volunteer mission for Veterans ! It was kind and timely!

9612 2018-03-15 01:30:43 False on a technicality. Would not interfere with oil *production*, but would interfere with ducks being able access the preen gland to spread oil on their feathers.
9613 2018-03-15 01:30:38 I throw oil in a pan, heat it, roast 'em, and season up before eating.
9614 2018-03-15 01:30:37 Haha. Oh no! My trick is to boil a cup of water, and put in 1 drop of peppermint oil and 1 drop of Eucalyptus. Then inhale the steam (don’t drink). It works so well.
9615 2018-03-15 01:30:35 I’ve been using just a couple of drops of almond oil and it’s really helped my face. Obviously everyone is different, but it was night and day for me
9616 2018-03-15 01:30:35 The news reporting is dead.

9618 2018-03-15 01:30:32 So let's raise entrance fees so people don't visit anymore then we can claim the desolate land for oil & gas drilling!
9619 2018-03-15 01:30:17 I texted my dad “happy PI day!” He said “no, I took the car in for an oil change.” 
Apparently, PI stands for PE day, which in his mind was code for day off work... 
9620 2018-03-15 01:30:14 OIL DIFF: 3.99 -> 4.02

9632 2018-03-15 01:28:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9633 2018-03-15 01:28:27 Canada has been buying dirty and unethical oil for ever. Liberals want to kill our oil industry and now regulate someone else's. Are they planning for Canada to go oil free, kill off the minions so only the elites are left alive?
9634 2018-03-15 01:28:19 I may need a few more coupons if I have to make the trip to Ohio or North Carolina from Texas for an oil change lol.

9638 2018-03-15 01:27:40 Went to pour some olive oil on sweet potatoes before baking. Should have read label to see it say balsamic vinegar. Maybe next time.

9645 2018-03-15 01:26:19 Please, stop pandering to Colorado voters.  You'll vote how the oil industry pays you to vote and we'll have fracking drills all over RMNP in the coming years.  2020 can't get here soon enough when Colorado votes you out.
9646 2018-03-15 01:26:04 I live in Alberta. No one walks anywhere. Urban sprawl and oil baby.

9650 2018-03-15 01:25:24 How bad is it?  \Was paint water based or oil based?
9651 2018-03-15 01:25:23 Olive oil can go fuck itself. Garlic oil should be the standard
9652 2018-03-15 01:25:05 I usually make mine with grass-fed butter and coconut oil, because it's a good way to get a lot of fat all at one time.
9653 2018-03-15 01:24:45 If Norway has a $trillion put away from oil can you explain to me why they are one of the highest taxed nations in the world? Just asking mate if they have all this money Lol #Cultsheepnattwat

9663 2018-03-15 01:23:03 The whole ethical oil scam. Pretending pipes are for Canadian self sufficiency and freedom from unethical oil. Too many politicks and propaganda artists thought lies and manipulation were easier than hard work and honesty over the last decade. Now they wonder why we don't trust.
9664 2018-03-15 01:23:02 Pfft, predictions, predictions Back when I was a kid, it was all about Peak Oil, and what the heck we were going to do when we ran out of it by the mid 1990s.
9665 2018-03-15 01:22:58 I like steel cut with coconut oil, blueberries, walnuts & maple syrup

9667 2018-03-15 01:22:43 Nice to see you online Chic. My day was not complete without at least saying 
9668 2018-03-15 01:22:14 It's an all-in one meal. Cut it open and you'll find a meatloaf inside. Just oil the whole thing as-is, wrap it in foil and bake for 40 min at 150 deg C.
9669 2018-03-15 01:21:48 To stop the pipeline which I agree with we need alternatives to stop the ever increasing drive for oil ! Yet research development grants are only given to Corporations or Universities.
9670 2018-03-15 01:21:29 I made some snacks for dinner and it's some toast w olive oil & melted blue cheese and honey and fried zucchini on the side w honey mustard and I can die in peace now thanks and goodnight

9673 2018-03-15 01:21:06 This article is not about 'fracking, it's about the entire oil & gas industry.
9674 2018-03-15 01:20:53 How dare the Trump administration propose doubling the entry fees Americans pay to visit our national parks and at the same time cut the royalty fees companies pay to get gas and oil off of the same PUBLIC LAND!!!!!

9687 2018-03-15 01:19:02 For this exercise, the BP Statistical Review puts a thumb on the scales for wind and solar, because it assumes that we want to use the energy as electricity and not thermally, so counts one Joule from wind or solar as equivalent to 2.63 Joules from oil.

9692 2018-03-15 01:18:52 We have welcomed and accepted the evil tagged "empowering widows" for so long! Empowerment is not giving rice. Empowerment is not giving palm oil. Empowerment is helping widows survive grief so they can stand STRONG. One major way include helping them to confront evil in-laws.

9698 2018-03-15 01:17:17 They’re not treated differently. The kids know you’re a snake oil salesman. Everyone is tired of the boomers’ politics, economics, and raping of our planet and culture. Boy bye.

9703 2018-03-15 01:16:56 if we can grow $30,000 a quart retail oil in sunlight would you do it? if it was ecological and beneficial? if if paid for your child free ride through college and a state job at the end of that?

9709 2018-03-15 01:15:41 Oil revenues driving the Canadian dollar up wasn’t a good thing, it caused widespread drag on our economy, since we are an exporter of raw materials. Canadians liked it because it on the surface it seems like something to be proud of, but the reality is very different.

9719 2018-03-15 01:14:32 Yes! I hate getting a patient whose been here for a week & I can’t get a brush through their hair. Once you get any gunk&oil out, if it’s really bad, use a drop of lotion followed by more alcohol. Rinse where you used it afterwards though because it’s incredibly drying!

9739 2018-03-15 01:11:58 Through existing pipelines for Canadian use, not new ones transporting oil for foreign markets.
9740 2018-03-15 01:11:55 It is true what you say about the oil. Putin is of course well aware of this & as much diversification is taking place as is possible or that can be managed with the skill set available. New markets are being nurtured. Organic food among them. Foundations are being laid.
9741 2018-03-15 01:11:40 Ktis Russell, Lucic and the 4th we will retain when the Oil dont play Montoya again
9742 2018-03-15 01:11:25 Too bad he doesn't have oil's back.  Those pipelines need to be built and he has nothing of importance to say on the subject. Not enough votes to be had I guess
9743 2018-03-15 01:11:13 this one smells like tea tree oil too what the fuck
9744 2018-03-15 01:11:12 They don’t protest is the countries with the “Real Dirty Oil” because there they would be shot.
9745 2018-03-15 01:11:10 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
9746 2018-03-15 01:11:03 OK, where is the replacement for oil which powers this world?
9747 2018-03-15 01:11:00 This is gonna sound stupid but does it leave your face oily and shiny or matte. I have a micellar oil to remove makeup and it works like a primer.

9762 2018-03-15 01:08:24 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
9763 2018-03-15 01:08:14 Procrastination as an adult is really exciting cause it’s like: Am I going to get arrested if I get pulled over because my license is expired? Is my truck going to explode because I refuse to get the oil changed? Who knows.

9767 2018-03-15 01:07:39 The over-reliance on Russian oil is the current problem. Prices are falling, inflation rising-
They've hardly got the best credit rating-

9780 2018-03-15 01:04:37 “Why are these students protesting what happens in other countries, are they idiots?!” -The same people who complain about how women are treated in Saudi Arabia as a reason to buy Alberta oil. #ABLeg #Irony
9781 2018-03-15 01:04:35 2/ All the politicians worth their salt were attempting to rebuild their countries some how or other with the "help" of western advisers. Russia's oil for instance was "saved" through deals that gave all profits to westerners for a full decade.
9782 2018-03-15 01:04:32 Mau dong.. Aku titip yah, berapaan kak?

Setau aku sih olive oil yg raw emang gitu, kalo yg mustika ratu kan udah dicampur pakai essence biar wangi.
9783 2018-03-15 01:04:19 @pscarb101 hi Paul which is better for fat loss mate , fish oil or CLA?
9784 2018-03-15 01:04:16 It may be true here as well, but what can RU export besides Oil,, s-400s, and maybe 20 Flankers a year.
9785 2018-03-15 01:04:14 Ugh, I know someone who lied to the server abt being allergic to seafood at RED LOBSTER bc they were there for someone's birthday dinner but don't like seafood. They just didn't want their chicken fingers to be cooked in same oil as fried shrimp. Assholes.
9786 2018-03-15 01:03:56 What specific sanctions are you referring to? Sanctioning other countries that does business with Russia harms more than Russia. Is Trump supposed to sanction the EU for buying oil from Russia? denying Visas? How does that hurt them much?
9787 2018-03-15 01:03:50 #INSen passes #CBD Oil 36-11.  The same measure just passed out of House Rules.  So it should be on its way to @GovHolcomb once is passes the full House.
9788 2018-03-15 01:03:40 I’m sure your oil buddies are in the denial and continue predicting unlimited growth for oil. Bet they used to work for Kodak or Blackberry. You’re on the wrong side of history dude. Wake up. E-tractors Starting. Tesla semi about to revolutionize trucking

Granted this isn’t as bad as hives, but I used to sneeze like 10 Times after every time I ate a meal. I never could figure it out. It slowly kinda just went away. Now it only happens occasionally.
9796 2018-03-15 01:02:28 This is nothing new. Every government is in bed with foreign oil. Conservatives had many years to build a pipe line or refinery but didn’t.

"Yeah, my brakes are due but can you just do the oil? I have a coupon?

9819 2018-03-15 00:59:40 Senate just approved a CBD oil 36-11. It doesn't address manufacturing - i.e. doesn't ban it or specifically allow it.
9820 2018-03-15 00:59:30 It's probably OK - salt of any sort can dry your skin, but the oil will help with that. What moisturiser do you use normally? I've only ever used Epsom salts for a horse that was foundering.  #LouisBestFans

9833 2018-03-15 00:58:26 Note to self: while using epoxy resin it is not wise to attempt to put a clear coat on top of a coat you used oil on. Welp. It’ll be done but I’ll have to fix it later 
9834 2018-03-15 00:58:13 The end, eh ? Peak might be 2040 to 2050 with a VERY slow decline rate. The ENTIRE food chain of the plain runs on oil. 8B+ people depend on it. Anyone advocating "end of oil" is either delusional or an advocate for mass starvation. Where are all the e-tractors, e-combines ...
9835 2018-03-15 00:58:11 I had an in person workshop for a course and the coordinator talked about her previous businesses in the oil industry. By the end of the workshop FB was showing me ads for home heating oil. We have a heatpump and electric heating so....

9848 2018-03-15 00:56:22 Not bringing product to tidewater doesn't mean oil won't be consumed. Just means customers will get it elsewhere from what are certainly less ecologically sensitive than Canada. We are not the environmental watchdogs for the rest of the world.

9876 2018-03-15 00:51:09 Are you soaking in the lemon oil too? haha lol jk
9877 2018-03-15 00:51:03 Flour, oil and sugar are cheap, can stretch more and won't spoil like fruits and vegetables.  Eating junk is more expensive long term tho
9878 2018-03-15 00:50:38 But what if i get my oil changed at Walmart
9879 2018-03-15 00:50:30 Latex or Oil based?
9880 2018-03-15 00:50:26 hey thanks Jayashree. I'm much better now :) And I don't do oil pulling. Been thinking, but something pushes me away!
9881 2018-03-15 00:50:23 Old business didn't survive. Same will happen with oil and coal.
9882 2018-03-15 00:50:17 My mom hates the smell of coconut oil.

Me: Reads a list of things you can use it for. 
11) Personal lubricant 

My mother: Ewww why would anyone want their pussy to smell like coconut oil?! 

Me: 
9883 2018-03-15 00:50:14 Honestly, if you are going to talk about these topics you need to read more and talk less. Oil sands is chemically correct as would bitumous sands. Tar sands is chemically incorrect and its use demonstrates the mindset of the user.
9884 2018-03-15 00:49:59 y’all gotta stop using coconut oil for everything
9885 2018-03-15 00:49:59 Still can’t believe sum bum ass jacked my beard oil lmfao like really bro? shit felt personal
9886 2018-03-15 00:49:50 plastic are made with petroleum products so as oil price go up, so does plastics
9887 2018-03-15 00:49:47 Fun fact. That was filled to the top with oil at one point 
9888 2018-03-15 00:49:47 Para coronar el día me lo tuve que cruzar al negro y correr hasta la oil para poder tomar un puto bondi. Igual te quiero♡
9889 2018-03-15 00:49:44 Can you kill a cat by coating every electrical cord in the house with chili oil because she won’t stop chewing them? Asking for a friend
9890 2018-03-15 00:49:35 A hot bath and then a shot of castor oil mixed with OJ  I know that’s not what you meant but if you haven’t tried it, there’s another idea lmao!
9891 2018-03-15 00:49:34 Honest to god, I’m a baker, & when I see people subbing out butter for coconut oil, quinoa for flour, & bath salts for pepper I can only be angry they actually reviewed the recipe. Why? You didn’t make that, you made something else & messed it up.
9892 2018-03-15 00:49:33 Wish you were as enthusiastic about Western Canada’s energy industry; the cleanest and most responsible oil and gas development in the world - we’re hurting here, due in no small part to decisions made in Ottawa.  #cdnpoli #ableg #abenergy

9901 2018-03-15 00:47:35 Did an oil change at 300 miles. It only takes .9 quarts so nothing too major. Will change every 1k miles depending on how the oil looks. I just lock the steering column and then close the cover for the ignition. You have to have a special key to open it.
9902 2018-03-15 00:47:28 That’s exactly the reason for the anti-Russia propaganda. Discredit Russia to justify full blown invasion of Syria (wer’re there illegally at the moment) - sell off oil rights to May’s corporate cronies. Open your eyes.

9911 2018-03-15 00:45:07 Check all long term forecasts by the IEA, OPEC, EIA, and major oil companies, they all predict major increase in demand for the middle of the barrel, not the top.  Many of them are predicting decline in demand for gasoline
9912 2018-03-15 00:44:45 i'll have to try that bc i also used to hate asparagus bc again,,, my mom only ever bought canned asparagus and microwaved it... but hten i had it roasted w/ olive oil garlic and powdered parmesan and like wow *kisses fingers* it was so good
9913 2018-03-15 00:44:41 It's an Alberta thing. So many people from here make a bunch of money and have the need to buy all this useless shit because they think it will make them happy. Then the oil boom ends and they stop making as much money and they get stuck.
9914 2018-03-15 00:44:40 Oil and water don’t mix

9918 2018-03-15 00:44:13 All I ever used mine for was heating baby bottles (now that I type that, I bet that was a bad thing to do ) and microwave popcorn.  Which is so much better cooked stove top in hot oil.

9922 2018-03-15 00:43:56 So what price is Alberta getting for the oil you are presently delivering for them?  Is it selling at a discount as well?  So if it is, how is an increase in supply going to help?

9938 2018-03-15 00:41:30 but it's not really traditional pizza either, the one i like best is literally just chili oil, fresh tomato sauce, and spicy salami strips. i think if cheese was involved i wouldn't enjoy the thin soft crust so much

9973 2018-03-15 00:36:51 I used to work in the wind business. The biggest contributors to the wind lobby were the oil companies. And for obvious reasons - their profits go up when you and me end up paying more for energy.
9974 2018-03-15 00:36:47 Cuzzooo! I had the sesame oil on deck already! The @steak_umm was actually on sale for the day! $5. Bell pepper was $1.25. The ginger root, $2. Snap peas. $4.99. Broc was maybe 2. N carrots where cheap. I only bought 3!
9975 2018-03-15 00:36:40 Seems in 2014 when Al Abadi became PM of Iraq found 50,000 fictitious "ghost soldiers" in payroll with officials reaping $380 million a year. Tattered country needs $90 billion to rebuild? Has mammoth oil reserves about 148 billion barrels 5th largest in world with untapped gas?

9986 2018-03-15 00:35:21 actually if they removed the booms at Old Ford the current will take the oil away from the Olympic Park! They probably did that deliberately to prevent the oil being taken down the River Lea through the Park, prefer it to go down the Navigation!

9990 2018-03-15 00:34:53 Applicable for oil exports perhaps - not refined fuel products in this scenario. BC (via TMP) is only province, aside from Alberta, that utilizes AB refined fuel products AFAIK. Neighbouring Saskatchewan has 2 refineries for combined 114,000 barrel/day.
