10 2019-01-02 23:54:49 Absolutely. Low in confidence. Having played league cricket when much younger for a couple years, so easy to provide an input. Even Pujara could have opened. 

Haha! Stocks - different story altogether. Still a sell the rip market.

14 2019-01-02 23:50:43 I was wondering why the market dips in the morning, yet closes higher. It's west coast traders coming on line and buying. Sell early, then buy other stocks before the close????

42 2019-01-02 23:46:58 The ASIC should run a test case against some of the HC Love hearts who have been spruiking their stocks on Hotcopper ( #wheremoneygoestodie ) while selling.

44 2019-01-02 23:46:37 Never heard of "sell on good news"? How old are you? Hope you are not all-in Tesla or Apple... Hyped stocks can fall very fast. Money management can save your a$$

46 2019-01-02 23:45:57 Can someone teach me about stocks
47 2019-01-02 23:45:54 Wall Street Selling Stocks
48 2019-01-02 23:45:53 What about stocks?
49 2019-01-02 23:45:43 I need a new mentor. Someone who has wisdom with stocks and real estate investments.
50 2019-01-02 23:45:02 chrom can literally take a stock from 0 with very few reads on WW, to get guaranteed stocks at 0 on other stages he has to upb suicide but not on WW
51 2019-01-02 23:45:00 Actually the stocks still pretty good since election.
52 2019-01-02 23:44:51 Yup. But I have 25 years of past performance. we’re holding 40% cash and bonds right now. You only see what people like to talk about. Hot stocks on twitter.
53 2019-01-02 23:44:02 @realDonaldTrump since you claimed responsibility for + stocks, you are resp for the - stocks. Thanks for a NEGATIVE stock market in 2018. Obama never gave us this. You are a Goof. #Trump
54 2019-01-02 23:43:10 Here’s an idea. Those who benefited from tax breaks and fab returns in the last few years can buy #AAPL $AAPL products and donate them to needy schools. Ask around, research what’s needed. 

Sales get a bump, good eventually for stocks. 

Circular “wealth effect”.
55 2019-01-02 23:43:05 Time to BUY BUY BUY Stocks... $AAPL $IBM $TSLA and more
56 2019-01-02 23:42:43 I have stocks started by family too but I honestly have no idea how that affects my taxes cause I have never done my own 
57 2019-01-02 23:41:56 $KBLT.V already own it, it’s coming back big after the China/US trade war concludes. Gotta love beaten down cobalt stocks
58 2019-01-02 23:41:20 We green the first day of trading of the year, both in stocks and forex. 
59 2019-01-02 23:41:00 Dunno mate. When Smith and Warner come back into the side improving our batting stocks, it's not like you can argue that virtue has (or will) triumphed at last.
60 2019-01-02 23:38:49 Most global stocks trades for less than the book value per share throughout the 1970s. Nothing new here.
61 2019-01-02 23:38:25 Apple stocks tumble after company cuts forecasts after Chinese economic slowdown

> "China sneezes and the rest of the World catches a cold" ???!
62 2019-01-02 23:38:06 Depends on how fast the curve inverts. If stocks rally (especially financials) they will go as far as the "dots" said--between 2 and 3. If, on the other hand, 10 years do what it looks like they WANT to do--and go sub 2%-- then none.
63 2019-01-02 23:36:50 If you still haven't figured out 
Warren Buffet pumps stocks he wants to SELL to you.
Clue he is always long well before he comes on TV
64 2019-01-02 23:36:28 Tomorrow Apple stock will drag down market bigtime? Maybe a buying opportunity for other stocks who will go down alongside Apple? U SAY?
65 2019-01-02 23:35:56 I agree. Inventory is unsustainably low. Not good. Backlog is depleted (as now confirmed by Tesla), and they feared devaluation of stocks. That's why. I don't see ANY reason why there's a positive development. And the stock showed it today. You are mistaken to believe otherwise.
66 2019-01-02 23:35:17 The March Yen made a blowout on the up-side today. Raise sell-stops to take a profit to 91.25-last 93.50 and in a big profit. I do my trading with charts & indicators. Charts 90% & 10% fundamentals. This is the 21st century of computers. #Commodities #Stocks #Yen #Currencies
67 2019-01-02 23:34:38 apple ... sigh
45 you aint said a thing since the stock market started all the shenanigans... remember when you were taking credit it was all you why stocks were soaring? And saying it has nothing to do with 44 ? but now u shut up right ? or its all the "dems fault" now ?
68 2019-01-02 23:34:33 US stocks won't even close down tomorrow.
69 2019-01-02 23:34:33 RIP Super Dave, The Captain died, Apple stocks falling fast JFK BLOWN AWAY HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO SAY
70 2019-01-02 23:33:55 It's also gonna be a great time to buy. Homes, stocks, anything...
71 2019-01-02 23:33:55 Not saying it means something or nothing, but these moves we’re seeing in stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies don’t seem very “normal”
72 2019-01-02 23:33:28 penny stocks are for suckers.
73 2019-01-02 23:33:19 Are you getting rich now with your stocks?
74 2019-01-02 23:33:17 Just met this Lucina online and they were genuinely one of the most positive players I’ve seen. They were givin homie stocks, genuinely chillin out, playing the game fair and bein all “well played!” And stuff

That’s the stuff we need more of online tbh
75 2019-01-02 23:32:42 He did get the ban on bump stocks.. But one right doesn't hold a candle to 5,000 wrongs!
76 2019-01-02 23:32:34 I only bet small otherwise I’d be bouncing right now. Got Dow near lows, caught most of the oil rally & was short USDJPY. Few AIM stocks had a really good day as well & banked most of OPHR. 

Helmets on for equities tomorrow though.
77 2019-01-02 23:32:19 Its amazing how this demon became president i blame u dumbass people for puttin america threw this shit yall make america weaker everyday he is in power i just feel this was a big ass joke or like that date that stocks you when u dont want they ass no more
78 2019-01-02 23:31:53 I am sure that it will be a long time until the next real investing opportunity arises. I doubt it will be in 2019 as the market needs to be really be cruel in order to shakeout the perma bulls and early investors of the 10 year bull. A volatile sideways market works best.#stocks
79 2019-01-02 23:31:23 Stocks are overextended.  As interest rates rise, dollar more valuable and as a result, to compensate, price of stock drops since measured in dollars.  Also, stock price based on earnings and in many companies, that is going to be affected by tariffs .
80 2019-01-02 23:31:04 @realDonaldTrump $7B of revenue can cause a "market loss across ALL stocks" of $200B. Goes to show how Apple and the entire market move together......right or wrong.@tim_cook
81 2019-01-02 23:30:59 Hey!!.. have strict SL 30...on closing basis... Wait for next results .. if favouring then continue else exit . 
Also he can suggest you with stocks, it is our responsibility to check n enter at the proper levels.. and blaming him if stock not raising means what he will do ? Cool
82 2019-01-02 23:30:31 I guess u can say im salty about playin 2 matches w/@imsaltYT  both of which i get 2 stocks off em but some bullbull happens before i can get a chance to win!  But it was fun finally playing you! GG!
83 2019-01-02 23:30:29 Yup ... It was from this morning

"on the 2nd day (after independence) the value of almost all of Singapore's industrial stocks were climbing"
84 2019-01-02 23:30:20 @tim_cook just read that apples stocks have had some issues, I've been an Apple user for 10 years and all I've seen is less quality and higher prices ie soldered ram and SSD, iPhones are 1400 plus tax, you've lost touch with the customers
85 2019-01-02 23:29:46 We cane at 2 so they would have exchanged already, they waited for us. Ridiculous 

They were giving stocks and couldn’t get my mom a 25$goft card to target

The weed I got her and money I gave is all she got(weed is a good gift imo)
86 2019-01-02 23:29:35 When people can't let go of For Glory, so they fill the gap by putting two stocks and omega stages.
87 2019-01-02 23:28:28 Buffet will soon sell all his stocks, and I bet he sold out of $AAPL long ago
88 2019-01-02 23:28:21 yeaaah, it's so hard to finish stocks! I think I'm just gonna start focusing on Wolf or one of the other FE's. I'm too bad to be making it harder on myself
89 2019-01-02 23:28:18 So here are the pertinent cliff notes for Apple's weird behavior on halting stocks:

Combination of strong dollar and missing emerging markets in China collapsed their earnings projection. Hahaha. Okay, sounds, err, whatever. And also people just didn't upgrade their phones.
90 2019-01-02 23:28:13 Tech stocks drop in late trading after Apple trims forecast
91 2019-01-02 23:28:06 I can see all the craziness on Stocks/FX Trading Twitter. It's CT Early 2018 craziness all over again.

Some are calling this a simple correction, or a glitch (lol?!). But it's more of a Deja Vu to me.

Strange being able to say it with less than 2 years experiences of "trading".
92 2019-01-02 23:26:51 We got off to a great start today, especially for subscribers. $CCCL $SSI $TIK $ABAC $AMMA $RHE all moved nicely. Hope 2019 is a better year for us all!

Que tu me dises que c'est rien
96 2019-01-02 23:23:44 So I guess stocks falling is the equivalent of a tax hike??
97 2019-01-02 23:23:43 Stocks OVERSOLD... $AAPL oversold... GET IN NOW!
98 2019-01-02 23:23:42 Thank you for a horrendous market tomorrow! Hopefully some buyers will come in if @Apple gets down to 136 or maybe even a little higher! @CNBCFastMoney. @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC going to be nasty for the Apple supply chain stocks also as everybody already knows!
99 2019-01-02 23:23:27 That 50% is arbitrary. You would have to hit the top on bottom spot on. Easier said than done. I’m up 14x atm on cgc by holding for 5 years. I don’t hear many saying that about their trades. That said, if everyone was long the price might never go up :) So, Thanks!
100 2019-01-02 23:23:21 I’m going to assume stocks close up about 2% tomorrow
101 2019-01-02 23:22:50 If you have 2 stocks on your preferred rules for online Smash, you’re lame
102 2019-01-02 23:22:40 Time to BUY BUY BUY Stocks! $XOM $BP $KMI $C $BAC
103 2019-01-02 23:22:19 Like all big stocks the majority won’t jump on the $tsla bandwagon until it’s a 200b market cap.
104 2019-01-02 23:21:02 Maybe I’m not privileged enough to have a job with such retirement benefits or disposable income to play with stocks. Maybe my job was outsourced to China.
105 2019-01-02 23:20:57 maybe if you @SMTOWNGLOBAL will give a comeback to f(x) your stocks will go up. #RandomThoughts if ever you will give them a comeback IF EVER let victoria rest first
106 2019-01-02 23:20:48 el de invertir en stocks y eso de Mario Valle
107 2019-01-02 23:20:45 Dow futures down over 300 points and Nasdaq futures down 147 points due to $AAPL Q1 warning. Stocks like $CAT also down on China-related weakness.
108 2019-01-02 23:20:44 What got us here is a deceleration of earnings growth (particularly in explosive tech stocks). We were going up SO FAST, but now, flattening? An inflection point, risky... I don't see fundamentals holding this thing up, so question is: how much money does the ESF + PPT have left
109 2019-01-02 23:20:21 $AAPL update warning on iPhone sales is going to cause much further declines across the tech sector. Get you $$$$ ready #stocks #investing
110 2019-01-02 23:20:00 Pray for our po economy. Technology stocks keep dropping. Utility stocks keep dropping. And federal employees still ain't got paid. smh
111 2019-01-02 23:19:34 The people who make their preferred rules 2 stocks are literal scum and should be banned from the community
112 2019-01-02 23:19:22 he likes to make big come backs though.. so wouldnt rule out.. otherwise no politics or bias for me.. Only Stocks lol..
113 2019-01-02 23:18:28 Major pooch at apple. tech stocks getting spanked after hours. China weakness cited as source of miss exacerbated by trade war tensions.  Who says trade war insignificant mr fisher?
114 2019-01-02 23:18:27 Two big stocks tanking on trading day #1: not good for the market. Seems to me Johnny the fund manager can only lose telling his boss: O, I buy $AAPL and $TSLA now because they are cheap!
115 2019-01-02 23:18:01 Apple stocks dropped to 145 aint this a dirty hoe
116 2019-01-02 23:17:56 Yes, otherwise it's just another form of insider trading. My House Rep invested heavily in particular tech stocks.....She was on the House Science, Space & Tech Committee
117 2019-01-02 23:17:41 This is very well said, even though I enjoy the relatively calm market over the last few days. Trading mostly preferred stocks, baby bonds and CEFs, I feel like the moves I've seen there resemble mostly a bear market rally, rather than a real recovery.
118 2019-01-02 23:17:32 Another good day with my stocks.  investing all 2019
119 2019-01-02 23:16:54 all my stocks on Robinhood are on Let Go and Let God
120 2019-01-02 23:16:23 #stocks there will b opportunities tomorrow morning. Not everything is effected by $appl shortfall. They specifically mentioned China. Cud turn out to help get a trade deal. Will b watching 4 any sloppy selloffs on SC bio's I follow. May add to $vktx if it drops back into 7's
121 2019-01-02 23:16:03 It is not about Apple being down <7% it is about leadership stocks breaking down. 
Yes it has cash but as the saying goes there are always two bandits to relieve you of the cash one being Warren Buffet
122 2019-01-02 23:15:43 Market Close: MBS +17bps; DOW +18.78; NASDAQ +30.66; S&P 500 +3.18; 10yr Treasury 2.62%; Stocks and MBS rebound off earlier lows.
123 2019-01-02 23:15:13 When you see the market is down and the stocks are all down. Don’t worry people. It’s just a glitch. When the glitch is fixed. The market will be going back up. $spy $dia $qqq
124 2019-01-02 23:14:37 Does everyone know someone they went school with who's inexplicably rich now n jus post pics of whatsapp groups about stocks n shares?? n they all wear those LV high tops??
125 2019-01-02 23:14:17 Harley Davidson... Why???? Should have followed Trump's lead!!!! Stocks are plummeting now for the last two years. Bring them back home! Turn your bike around!!!
126 2019-01-02 23:13:53 reminder that stocks dropping while wages rise represents an expected shift of income away from capital and into labor
127 2019-01-02 23:12:44 Stocks be like 
2-1

128 2019-01-02 23:12:32 Bump stocks, legal at time of Mandalay Bay Las Vegas mass shooting, enabled rapid (automatic) fire in succession. Over 1100 rounds fired. 58 killed. 851 injured, over 400 by gunfire. In 2017, U.S. gunfire deaths totaled 39,773. Unacceptable "gun control laws." Solutions needed.
129 2019-01-02 23:12:24 U.S. stocks close higher, on Wednesday 01/02/19 $DJIA +0.08% (+18.7) at 23,346.24, $SPX +0.13% (+3.1) at 2,510.03, $COMPQ +0.46% (+30.6) at 6,665.94.
130 2019-01-02 23:12:04 I just rolled my eyes today as I saw another ridiculous technical bounce up which delayed the inevitable move lower. When people don’t go crazy buying after a move lower may be the time to SLOWLY buy stocks.
131 2019-01-02 23:11:22 #trade Was the 9 Percent Drop in the S&P 500 Really Just a 'Glitch' Like President Trump Says?

Somewhat unlikely trade deals could stem the tide of falling stocks.
132 2019-01-02 23:11:20 Gas prices usually go down in winter and rise in summer, moron.

My mutual funds and stocks also went down. In fact, they nosedived. Want to take credit for that too, because at least then you'd be telling the truth.
133 2019-01-02 23:11:13 I think it will trade lower, probbaly not much lower then here and we have to see what happens with trade or it could certainly be dead money but no worse than most stocks in that scenario.
134 2019-01-02 23:11:10 Kanye gave Kim K stocks 4 Xmas! What y’all get?  #Levels

136 2019-01-02 23:10:46 U.S. stocks close higher, on Wednesday 01/02/19 $DJIA +0.08% at 23,346.24, $SPX +0.13% at 2,510.03, $COMPQ +0.46% at 6,665.94, $RUT +0.54% at $1355.91.
137 2019-01-02 23:10:41 Let me get this straight, we lost our asses in stocks, 401K’s, no tax right offs, shutdown w/o pay & a f’ing pay freeze while the rich got everything!?!? R family have all jumped off the trump train & say all R’s should be fired & kicked out NOW! TODAY!
138 2019-01-02 23:10:27 damn apple's stocks got damaged
139 2019-01-02 23:09:36 2019 is the year of DUDE WEED STOCKS LMAO
140 2019-01-02 23:09:08 Is this what we’re calling stocks now
141 2019-01-02 23:09:03 Similar type of retaliation had been posed by Chinese authorities to South Korean companies because of THAAD issue years ago. And that had been very negative for stocks
142 2019-01-02 23:08:29 I take advantage if big swings. Example for the past two trading days is WFT bought Monday, went up 35%. When stocks go up that much there will be consolidation to stabilize so cash out at top. Then I bought .50 puts making 225%
143 2019-01-02 23:08:25 My credit isn’t good but these APR percentages ain’t bad. Had to cash out on them stocks for this 
144 2019-01-02 23:07:56 You have already outperformed  the  entire CNBC staff put together. Should probably step up  to guru status and make video's of paddling a conoe on a tropical island and trading stocks on the laptop at the same time.
145 2019-01-02 23:07:14 Vu le niveau suis en rupture de stocks .....
146 2019-01-02 23:06:44 So the central banks need a solution and so far I can't see it. A 50% correction might do the trick I suppose but after that we need to grow like crazy to see some benefit of the internet in stocks. Or did the market anticipated the internet in the 1980s and it is baked in? 
147 2019-01-02 23:06:43 $AAPL $IBM - the two tech stocks that have been owned by Warren Buffett have not done well lately; maybe Warren should've stuck to his original premise which was to not purchase tech stocks!
148 2019-01-02 23:06:39 Ole timmy sold 100 million in stocks just back in Jan, what great timing lol
149 2019-01-02 23:05:37 Will today be the Jump The Shark moment for tech stocks? Let’s watch....
150 2019-01-02 23:05:29 do you have a 401k? if so, you own stocks
151 2019-01-02 23:04:54 My question is more why has this happened. As I am currently litigating  cases with weed stocks
152 2019-01-02 23:04:13 should hold it like stocks and stick with with it for the long haul!
153 2019-01-02 23:03:44 In other words:  here’s an open invitation to pump stocks you already own guys.
154 2019-01-02 23:03:23 Gjentatte studier viser at ganske mange mangler en forståelse av forskjellen på «stocks» and «flows» som fører til at man tenker bortfall av oljeinntekter automatisk fører til umiddelbart dårligere norsk økonomi. At vi faktisk bare stopper veksten er ikke nødvendigvis intuitivt
155 2019-01-02 23:03:23 Pot stocks will be up though...
156 2019-01-02 23:03:21 So what are some good stocks to get into during the 2019 year?! #HappyNewYear #StockMarket

158 2019-01-02 23:01:53 wow what's up with today lot of stocks on my filters. on watch sub penny $ARLZQ $SEVA $CBYI $PLPL penny to dollar $USRM $POTN $GSAT dollar to five $SID $VTVT $MEET $ZNGA five to twenty $ACCO $QTT
159 2019-01-02 23:01:38 $spy giving up gains and so does few tech stocks after $aapl lowered their guidance. Tomorrow will be another fun day especially in tech sector. Vix needs to drop below 20
160 2019-01-02 23:01:23 The deal

163 2019-01-02 22:59:22 Apple stocks tumble after company cuts forecasts for key quarter | guardian
164 2019-01-02 22:58:50 $PLAG Hasnt moved much compared to CCCL CREG and other Chineese stocks. Expecting a nice run on this one!
165 2019-01-02 22:58:28 It’s one of the great cons Leave has spun. It was the UK government who wanted quotas to protect stocks. It was the UK government who then sold licenses to the highest bidder and screwed the UK fishing industry.
166 2019-01-02 22:58:21 I’m probably wrong. And I’m no good at math. But It’s become easy to purchase shares of many stocks w/ one click and I believe that when the selling begins it will accelerate the next downward leg of this bear. ETF’s were not around during any past recessions. We’ll see!
167 2019-01-02 22:58:09 One thing I want to do this year is learn a great deal about stocks and bonds and expand my investments
168 2019-01-02 22:58:09 So, seems like a good move to get out of stocks at near the top and move into crypto while it's near the bottom......
169 2019-01-02 22:56:57 Blaming tanking stocks on a "glitch"??  How about on the risk you introduce to the world with your idiocy? #25thAdmendmentNow
170 2019-01-02 22:56:55 when cody ko said “i got bonds not stocks bitch that’s how you save”.... i felt that shit
171 2019-01-02 22:56:16 good to see apple dragging down all the tech stocks
172 2019-01-02 22:56:14 It's the three stocks is all
173 2019-01-02 22:55:57 More likely, we're about to see the stocks of all four companies take a HUGE hit... Feinstein is Ranking on Senate Judiciary and Vice Chair of Senate Intelligence... and yes, it is legal for Senators/Reps to trade based on legislative action they are about to undertake.
174 2019-01-02 22:55:04 Our town does this every summer. The books (kids picture book, junior chapter book, grownup book) are announced well in advance, the independent bookstore stocks a bunch, and the library gets a bunch. There’s a “read out” on the library lawn, and in cafes and etc. it’s neat!
175 2019-01-02 22:54:38 Thanks for bearing with us, Chris. There are still plenty of Umbrellas available, so feel free to pop on down, though they'll only be available whilst stocks last.
176 2019-01-02 22:54:25 2018 was the worst December for stocks since 1931, and all major indexes saw their worst yearly performances since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 was down 6.2% , the Dow declined by 5.6%, and the Nasdaq fell by 3.9%, its worst annual performance since 2008. #bigbeautifulbrain
177 2019-01-02 22:53:30 You're going to see crashes in real estate, stocks, auto financing, student loans....which will result in major job losses in tech, finance, banking, real estate, we are in for alot of pain and its global. Expect a lot less volume in the markets over the next 2 years :(
178 2019-01-02 22:53:27 You know, not one of those guys warned about the danger of zero bound rates when Bernanke and Yellen were pouring the coals to reserves and stocks were making perpetual new highs.
179 2019-01-02 22:53:20 in what tho? stocks too slow. like what else can i invest into.
180 2019-01-02 22:52:51 Me either. Maybe we should buy some stocks! 
181 2019-01-02 22:52:03 Apple down 8%. Any comments given you own a bit of em?
Will you be reviewing your policy of buying stocks? Starting to look rather FOOLISH.
182 2019-01-02 22:51:49 $AAPL down 8% after the close. Another reason I'm bearish this market. When stocks like $AAPL, $FB, $NFLX and $GOOGL are so weak, what is there to bring the market higher? Yes, $FB rallied today but directly into resistance, where I shorted it again, along with $NKE.
183 2019-01-02 22:51:30 I didn’t realize readers were publicly traded stocks. Lol
184 2019-01-02 22:50:41 Enormous moves on currency markets on yhe aussie and yen pairs...its done stocks are about to go high selling its over......
185 2019-01-02 22:49:17 Yep.  They would have been a lot Messier had I not bailed so many stocks
186 2019-01-02 22:49:06 Ok guys what we buying tommo? Freed up some cash, I’m to lazy to look for new stocks tonight so please post a comment of what ur buying tommo.
187 2019-01-02 22:47:29 President Hump, you have nothing to do with gas prices but your tariffs are hurting Americans. Worst year in the last decade for stocks, take credit for screwing our economy. Wise up and shut up. Concentrate on answering Mueller when he indicts you. Big BABY, bye Felicia!
188 2019-01-02 22:47:16 Gonna do a bunch of xanax and buy random stocks, see how much I profit a month from now when I forget
189 2019-01-02 22:46:58 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 3% Positive. Stocks: $AVL was 23% Positive, with $SPX 0% (Neutral). #ASX
190 2019-01-02 22:46:31 @realDonaldTrump dollar dropping; tech stocks dropping; DOW dropping. What gives, sir?
191 2019-01-02 22:45:52 Grrr.  Got stopped out of my GC today when it dropped into 1280s. Thought it was wide enough but being a trailing stop the ON tag of 1290 moved me up.   Just mining stocks left and my /SI.  5% stop on that one lol
192 2019-01-02 22:45:27 Stocks
193 2019-01-02 22:45:01 Most cryptos in that sense are like mining stocks (before discovery). Call options. Mining stocks though give ownership and add no friction. Utility are unnecesary even in the event of a platform succeding.
194 2019-01-02 22:44:43 I wonder how many schmucks bought into $AAPL for the trillion dollar parade to then have lost 30%.
Had short written all over it.
Dow stocks are easy bread and budduh pickings.
Bull trap paradise.
195 2019-01-02 22:44:40 Its almost common practice for investment houses to pump chosen stocks on Trading Social Media. 'Rampers' & 'de-Rampers' are paid by larger corporate entities to help drive the market in a chosen direction... there are many examples on the web if you look hard enough...
196 2019-01-02 22:44:28 I prefer gifts in stocks
197 2019-01-02 22:44:27 Just read short piece in @thenation that if we simply took back some of the stocks the 1% now get of Corp profits- we could forgive all debt and not cost the govt. amazing what the green of the 1% prevents. Meanwhile the apr on debt means we’ll never pay it off & govt makes bill.
198 2019-01-02 22:44:20 This is just perfect.
Because of this fucker i am shorting sp500 from last hours and in Cash i crypto.
This is just nice.
5 wave start in stocks and it Will drove crypto aka btc in his LAST 5 wave and caoitulation
199 2019-01-02 22:44:09 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @kurteichenwald the stocks to were once again a roller coaster ride today, TRump has blamed the stock market’s tumble in the final quarter of 2018 on the Federal Reserve. See a pairing it is #NeverTrump problem he blames anyone/thing never him!
200 2019-01-02 22:44:07 Yup.  I'm debating purchasing stocks in scotties snotties tissues. 
Up n down like a yoyo! It's the pics of John John set me off usually...

202 2019-01-02 22:43:09 You sir mean crypto correlating or opposite stocks?
203 2019-01-02 22:41:48 Yes #DowJones -6%,
BUT, NIKEI -16%,
 DAX -18%,Shanhai -24%...
Thanks to #Potus that US based #stocks performed better than foreign .

208 2019-01-02 22:40:48 #charliemunger #WarrenBuffett maybe #bitcoin is not the turd - maybe it’s all the $aapl stock you’ve been buying.  I’ve learned stocks can get a lot cheaper so I’m not the hero here
209 2019-01-02 22:40:39 @cvpayne Honestly, what earnings multiples are the international stocks trading at these days?? the carnage continues with them....if US is down to ~ 13-14 X Internationals must by like 9-10X, they have to be buys and come back soon....

215 2019-01-02 22:38:43 Yooo is anyone else buying apple stocks rn 
216 2019-01-02 22:37:22 In doubles I feel like checking to see how many stocks I have left is the equivalent of taking my eyes off the road when driving
217 2019-01-02 22:36:51 Bighit‘s networth is around 60-70 million usd. This trillion won/ billion usd is a PROJECTED VALUE meaning it deals with stocks and company assets. If Bighit was making billions a year, then there would be something seriously wrong with BTS being worth only 7-8 mil individually
218 2019-01-02 22:36:23 You are right. The more I thought about it, I have had Stocks with good earnings but poor performance after.
219 2019-01-02 22:36:22 $AAPL will be fine. Now is the time when the wealthy/rich get richer.I love apple products but 1k is to much 4A phone.This will B the first of many blue chip stocks taking a huge dip this year. We are over do 4A recession.Learn how 2play chess not checkers GL
220 2019-01-02 22:35:31 The Tories don't give a shit. It's not affecting them. They don't understand people depend on pennies each week. They just assume everyone has bonds & stocks to fall back on, If not a wealthy family who will take over the bills & send them to the country cottage to recuperate.
221 2019-01-02 22:35:01 MY GOD we cannot get a break. I REALLY wish Trump & Xi would make a f*cking deal - the markets would fly. It's annoying, b/c I actually agree that we should hold China to the fire re IP theft - I always have.  It would be hypocritical of me to pretend otherwise. $AAPL #Stocks
222 2019-01-02 22:33:57 Maybe not a bad thing considering this government are reportedly going to let the stocks shares and the pound collapse to scare people into voting for her withdrawal agreement! 

Maybe time that power was taken away from politicians/ bankers.

237 2019-01-02 22:30:47 Unpopular opinion: I find that headlines do not drive the wave movements of stocks (ex - flash crash or Lehman type events). Headlines simply move stocks to where they were heading anyways, quicker. I bet $SPX closes higher before lower low despite $AAPL announcement. But WDIK?
238 2019-01-02 22:30:42  My stocks in Apple just plummeted
239 2019-01-02 22:30:39 Buying shares all 2k19. I’ve been learning privately about stocks and bonds, real estate and credit repair. I’m executing what I’ve learned this year. Ready for the risk!
240 2019-01-02 22:29:47 I think there's a big caveat.  Earnings and sales have the ability to give a stock lift but its not guaranteed nor does it last forever.  Stocks will often top out while earnings and sales are still great.
241 2019-01-02 22:29:24 Me after ... i mean it is a good and bad thing. More stocks for us at the end of the month.
242 2019-01-02 22:29:22 Part of me wonders whether this $AAPL downgrade might turn out to be “sell the rumor - buy the news” in the end.. stocks have already downgraded their outlook via price action and this lower guidance eliminates uncertainty which was baked into the price
243 2019-01-02 22:29:16 #Apple stock is cheap according to Tim Cook, more stock buy backs incoming... youre only down 14 billion on the 2018 buybacks, might as well buy some more I guess?  Maybe put it all on red, probably better odds....

247 2019-01-02 22:28:11 spanish markets , serve me as a global market indicator, are in doldrums since many weeks, months and even years ago, but they never really woke up from their 2007 highs´ hangover. I don´t expect spanish stocks falling further. This is why I am optimistic now regarding USA market
248 2019-01-02 22:28:10 Besides of the fact that ADHD can be very tough to treat, stocks under 5 or even under 1 like this one is extremely volatile and some ppl translate that into easy money. Which is.....a bit silly 
249 2019-01-02 22:27:39 I am trying to have more patience but i can promise you it took me quite a few yrs to develop more patience. I have learned stocks can be beyond irrational to the downside AND upside longer than you can even imagine at times
250 2019-01-02 22:27:31 Yes and I should have sold several stocks today coz Apple will tank the market. I don’t own Apple but all China reliant stocks are dropping. He could have waited a week to put out such bad news and not on first day of 2019 trading!

256 2019-01-02 22:25:34 The tech stocks/companies will eventually decline and level out. It is how the free hand of the market works.
257 2019-01-02 22:25:32 Depends on how much correlation/spillover people expect with the other stocks in each index, doesn’t it?
258 2019-01-02 22:25:23 I'd say stocks for me...
259 2019-01-02 22:25:20 I don’t invest in markets, just stocks bud.
260 2019-01-02 22:25:19 Stocks are way overvalued so this does not surprise me.
261 2019-01-02 22:24:57 What other stocks you have in mind?
262 2019-01-02 22:24:43 Chinese stocks are all down 30-70%. Six months later we find out "Chinese growth is slowing". This is not a surprise. I'm not buying $aapl, but good stocks are about to be smacked.
263 2019-01-02 22:24:39 Unlike random stocks, metals will always have value.
264 2019-01-02 22:24:31 With the big tech stocks like Apple, Amazon, etc. and the banks slipping.....that volitilidy is making $BTC look pretty stable about now.  

Not to mention a juicy place to put your $ if shit keeps getting worse.

266 2019-01-02 22:24:08 The rate of home price gains slowed in November. U.S. Stocks lower to begin 2019. U.S. manufacturing activity declined in December from Nove
267 2019-01-02 22:23:50 Good that we soon will get a deal done and trump will gladly take credit for the big bounce in stocks
268 2019-01-02 22:22:32 Now that I think about it, I achieved two important goals of mine in 2018: putting money in a stocks investment club and a real estate investment club.

And I started a real estate investment company - wasn’t on the list but here I am lol

Shout out to me
269 2019-01-02 22:22:23 Provacan is worth the slightly higher price tags to whatever Holland and Barrett stocks. The stuff is pure miracle juice! @ProvacanCBD
270 2019-01-02 22:22:23 For the life of me I can’t understand why we need semi & Automatic weapons that spill out bullets by the second & bump stocks & High Capacity Mags. Why?? We aren’t living in a war torn country or civil war. They can keep their 2ndA, but why? Those particular weapons?
271 2019-01-02 22:21:07 The story would have been different had there been No Tradewar. Even if @POTUS can strike a deal with the Chinese stocks will rebound.
272 2019-01-02 22:20:59 The stocks might be a better option for folks like him.
273 2019-01-02 22:20:49 $AAPL is a hardware company. Lot like $IBM $DELL. Take off screen. There are 25 better stocks to trade.

276 2019-01-02 22:19:36 agreed, ETF's and 401k's are simply made up of the same stocks across the board. it's great when everything goes up, now people learning the downfalls of these trading tools
277 2019-01-02 22:19:25 Massengill stocks sent down word after news report shows that Mitt Romney is now the most recognizable douche in America…

281 2019-01-02 22:18:00 Doug kass screams to short AAPL from $100 to $200, covers at 205, gets long banks stocks at that time. Aapl now at $146. Can't make that up. Kass is the man who can't shoot straight
282 2019-01-02 22:18:00 I did and I remain short the US. I still think there is a long way to go for the S&P. Aussie less so but we'll probably get caught up in the downwind. Also property losses will be starting to bite and may impact stocks as many hunker down to try and ride out the storm.
283 2019-01-02 22:17:55 Pakistan stocks down 30% since NS Govt dislodged! but all Dawood group shares up 20-40% be it Razzak or Hussian Dawood! these lowlifes only prosper under establishment rule. from Ayub Khan to Zia to Musharaf to now! gutter ppl who have looted Pak for last 70yrs!

287 2019-01-02 22:15:52 Wow I never knew a virgin can HAS A daughter and what’s up with my activisionblizzard stocks I’m down a few thousand on that
288 2019-01-02 22:15:38 Nice tips Cyclops. I always use the volume advances scan at the end of each day to select stocks that have good liquidity and match macro events. Nothing worse then getting trapped in illiquid stocks, which generally get pumped by traders trying to exit.

291 2019-01-02 22:15:16 Nonsense. In that case, why is Trump trumpetting loudly and praising himself when stocks go up, bus is he deadsilent when the stocks plunge?

Apparently stocks are only important to Trump when they rise.
292 2019-01-02 22:14:29 Brand campaign, stocks, all that :-)
293 2019-01-02 22:14:19 Hello! Interest check pa lang to dear and as of now, meron pa :)) I'll inform everyone not later than tomorrow if okay na lahat, including the form. Kasi mejo nagkakaubosan na daw yung stocks for the mag  I'll message you agad once okay na. Huhu. Thank you and sorry! 
294 2019-01-02 22:12:52 The danger (and of course I don't own any tech stocks) is that $AAPL becomes dead money, the way $MSFT was for several years.
295 2019-01-02 22:12:38 the tragic flaw is in the S&P weighting, a handful of stocks should not make or break the index #deepthoughtsbychigrl
296 2019-01-02 22:12:32 Running on no sleep but hey started work today, stocks looking good, bitcoin looking good, hopefully all these investments come threw this year
297 2019-01-02 22:12:28 I don’t understand stocks at all. Just looks like numbers and lines
298 2019-01-02 22:12:01 $YUMA in this crappy Market that's a mess every damn day, I Am shifting towards stocks that are cheap and bouncing off their 52-week lows
299 2019-01-02 22:11:35 I think they will though- pension plans are going to be insolvent if stocks don't go up 10-12% per year.
300 2019-01-02 22:11:19 So if we taxed gains on a PR the question on whether to buy a home vs renting while investing in stocks or a business might work out differently. Isn't that the policy we should be considering and weighing the pros and cons of?
301 2019-01-02 22:11:14 Stocks for jawbreakers were up n down like the housing market
302 2019-01-02 22:11:06 So yeah SteveWh44494502, It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. 

How did Macedonia fair?
303 2019-01-02 22:11:04  Stocks.
304 2019-01-02 22:10:21 I haven’t looked at my stocks in over a month, I’m too scared to. (that and I’m too occupied with a new baby to do anything)
305 2019-01-02 22:10:20 Queing up in elite smash for battlefield no items no smash ball 3 stocks and seven minutes but getting moray towers hazards on smash ball items lag and a campy link is why i dont like this game sometimes. just sayin
306 2019-01-02 22:10:01 AAPL down 7+% in after hours on the guidance for Q1.  Stocks and cross JPY slammed during the worst possible time of the day to trade....
307 2019-01-02 22:09:13 Except for the NFA,  aaannnnnndddd The GCA aaannnnnndddd bump stocks and mag limits in NJ aaannnnnndddd you continue to say you're protecting our rights but you are complicit on all of these!
308 2019-01-02 22:08:40 Why do you think many stocks are down 50 pct already?You don’t think that was the market pricing in a slowdown?
309 2019-01-02 22:08:32 Been telling y’all... tech stocks are just legacy shitcoins
310 2019-01-02 22:08:15 The Plan - make a profit at all costs. Use every tool available. Learn from others, read the best book from the best long term traders. Watch what the “Big Dogs” do, then do what they do. Watch Hedge Funds and Pension Funds. Look at insiders, the SEC, earnings, and.. Dr_Stocks 
311 2019-01-02 22:07:43 It's funny that @Apple stocks take a hit today after I ordered an iPhone yesterday.
312 2019-01-02 22:07:33 Should be put in the stocks on Tower Hill to gauge the country’s thoughts on the subject
313 2019-01-02 22:07:32 Deere: Material Downside Into 2019

Hey, more good news to buy stocks fools
314 2019-01-02 22:07:29 Horrible time for stocks to slump for Apple especially when there’s nothing for them to release until June.
315 2019-01-02 22:07:22 As tug-o-war goes on whether bank recap will help industry or farm may be good idea to consider FIBC: FARMERS' INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY CODE to allow banks to settle with farm loan defaulters basis land/livestock/agri-stocks collateral similar to NPA settlement in corporate sector
316 2019-01-02 22:07:19 Nice time to short China exposed tech stocks;  $SPY $AAPL #spx #nasdaq
317 2019-01-02 22:07:11 Yo why my stocks fall in like this! Y’all better figure it out
318 2019-01-02 22:06:49 I’m so sick  all my stocks are plummeting
319 2019-01-02 22:06:26 If I told you that next year we’d have 3% GDP, no wars, huge fiscal stimulus for corporations, record buybacks, high consumer confidence, wage growth and 25% earnings growth, you’d probably forecast a double-digit gain for stocks during that year, wouldn’t you? Not down 6%...2018
320 2019-01-02 22:05:42 Apple looks really cheap to buy in right now. And you buy low on stocks.
321 2019-01-02 22:05:23 2018 was the worst year for stocks since 2008. Interesting, huh? Who became president that year?

323 2019-01-02 22:03:39 Doug Kass telling everyone on twitter how smart he is even though he's super long stocks with no shorts, as he said today. Plus Kass shorted AAPL from $100 to $200, covered at $200 and got super long bank stocks then.  cant make that up
324 2019-01-02 22:03:23 Apple stocks buggggggggin
325 2019-01-02 22:03:20 The cash $AAPL has on balance sheet is now about 41% of the market cap post this revenue forecast cut. A lot of tech stocks will get belted more from here, but at this basis the analysis is $AAPL stock is (finally) a good value. This pre-announce is a bad bellwether for 2019.
326 2019-01-02 22:02:14 Looks like I’ll be shorting more stocks this week
327 2019-01-02 22:01:51 And how is that relevant? Tech stocks have been tanking for weeks.
328 2019-01-02 22:01:50 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2019-01-02, is 310.12. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk

333 2019-01-02 22:00:52 $aapl So Apple revs fall 7 billion for the quarter.  But the market already took away 300 billion of market cap away, as a  forward action to this report.  Today’s after hour move penalizes co. an additional 60 billion in MC.  Yes stocks are forward looking but I would be a buyer
334 2019-01-02 22:00:48 Jumping back into tweeting about stocks this year. My old account was locked by $TWTR in August and I lost my followers, time to rebuild. #twitter #investing

338 2019-01-02 22:00:03 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
339 2019-01-02 22:00:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing stocks.
340 2019-01-02 21:59:47 Just reporting lower than expected Q1 earnings. Nothing to see here really folks. Stocks always halt trading briefly when announcing revised forecasts.
341 2019-01-02 21:59:39 I spent most of the end of last year watching the flow of stocks. I’d say invest in tech.
342 2019-01-02 21:59:26 Berkshire might be turning into an inverse signal when they start buying tech stocks..
343 2019-01-02 21:59:22 Yes, stocks get halted fairly regularly for a range of reasons.. Mostly due to imminent material news that would affect share price (T1 halt).. Stocks also get halted for exaggerated volatility in a short period. They call it the circuit breaker rule.
344 2019-01-02 21:58:58 It is just hard for me to buy indiv stocks for long term swings/trades when i think the general market has more downside - just how i trade
345 2019-01-02 21:58:38 Talk about a delay in the stocks reaction ah?
346 2019-01-02 21:58:26 I dont think ATR work or really worth looking at with Penny stocks since they are not really as consistant in terms of volume per day and range.
347 2019-01-02 21:58:25 Stocks down 8% in a few hours is still a huge blow.
348 2019-01-02 21:58:03 Tim Cook blames #China #trade war effects. Again, depend on #TrumpyBear and you get screwed. But not quite sure that is all there to the story. Object lesson of how "cheap" stocks get cheaper. $SPX $NDX $IWM
349 2019-01-02 21:58:03 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close mixed in volatile trading. Apple revised Q1 results lower in after hours as tech tumbles further.
350 2019-01-02 21:57:39 Doug kass screams to short AAPL from $100 to $200, covers at 205, gets long banks stocks at that time. Aapl now at $146. Can't make that up. Kass is the man who can't shoot straight

353 2019-01-02 21:56:46 but you need to get rid of Novarro and Lighthizer, by the way they act, they do nt read business/ economic news let alone watch stocks.
354 2019-01-02 21:56:26 Most stocks will have to... Major downturn
355 2019-01-02 21:56:20 En la carpa, las editoriales están un mes. Los stocks están escasos. Yo que tú voy mañana mismo.
356 2019-01-02 21:56:02 Your tweet caused their stocks to drop faster than my battery life
357 2019-01-02 21:55:43 Just depends if you’re trying to hold on to stocks or day trade lol
358 2019-01-02 21:55:40 HAHA Apple Stocks are plumme----sidguhkdalgaughufygjfdh APPLE IS A BENEVOLENT AND SUPREME CORPORATION
359 2019-01-02 21:55:10 You loved buying stocks so much they're all 40% off soon.
360 2019-01-02 21:54:57 It was bound to happen with the way they kept drastically increasing prices while giving hardly anything new in the phones. Glad I divested my Apple stocks a couple of months ago.
361 2019-01-02 21:54:36 Due to poor iPhonesales, Apple lowers its guidance (expectations) for quarter 1 of 2019.. this is a bad signal for stocks! Tech stocks have significant impact on the market @Investor_Smith
362 2019-01-02 21:54:13 Doug kass screams to short AAPL from $100 to $200, covers at 205, gets long banks stocks at that time. Aapl now at $146. Can't make that up. Kass is the man who can't shoot straight
363 2019-01-02 21:53:58 I invest in crypto currencies, pot stocks, automated intelligence, healthcare, and international real estate.  I’m always Looking for other people that may want to learn how to get started.
364 2019-01-02 21:53:51 Stocks don't halt before a big move upward, typically. Look for negative news here.
365 2019-01-02 21:53:51 Cyclical sectors outperform

Energy stocks lead rebound effort as oil prices spike

Defensive-oriented sectors under-performed
366 2019-01-02 21:53:49 "You won't get apple at (last) Monday's prices again (when it was in the 140s) said @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC @cnbc Please will people stop following these people.  They are the ones who know  nothing @cnbc $AAPL #appl #stocks
367 2019-01-02 21:53:39 @JoeBiden MR VICE PRESIDENT I WATCHED MANY VIDEOS OF YOU !I KNOW THE MAN !WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE UP TO !BOTH WITH FEDERAL LANDS AND CORPS IN STOCK MARKETS !I'M SURE THEY BUYING BACK ALL THEIR STOCKS ;MANY AND NOT SELLING ANYMORE IN MARKETS
368 2019-01-02 21:53:28 What have I been saying since early 2018? Overhyped/overowned tech stocks (cough, $AAPL, cough) are NOT the "right" stocks in this environment. Maybe Apple is oversold enough to bounce in the short term tomorrow . But this is why I said to sell them mos (and many %age points) ago
369 2019-01-02 21:53:20 Dry January starts when all the Christmas beer stocks are gone yeah?
370 2019-01-02 21:53:01 That’s a bet. I want to be taught how to fuck with stocks and maybe donmy taxes myself.

Before I moved to Texas I was dwarfed in age by my friends who had like 3-4 years on me. Now the closest person in age to me is 26 
371 2019-01-02 21:52:53 Questionable financially as well as morally. As more & more shareholders divest of these stocks their value will only decline.
372 2019-01-02 21:52:25 This is not a uptrending market, why are people buying long side??? Short the pops people!! It’s not unamerican to short stocks 
373 2019-01-02 21:52:09 Hi,

So this effect is because of the december effect? That the fund managers sell off their portfolio loosers before new year, and then after the new year they get busy buying stocks again?
374 2019-01-02 21:52:01 stratégie à explorer : on réduit le chargement par hectare à un niveau qui garanti l'approvisionnement fourrager les mauvaises années (on constitue des stocks de fourrages les bonnes années) ; les stocks périmés passent en méthanisation. Cf. Afterres2050
375 2019-01-02 21:51:48 Probably the last chance to pick up cheap apple stocks after tomorrow open.
376 2019-01-02 21:51:24 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $HOLX, $ABMD, $ABT, $NRG, and $PSA.
377 2019-01-02 21:51:19 $aapl down $10. Divest all stocks if u can. Going to be bad.
378 2019-01-02 21:51:11 $AAPL Markets down hard AH after Apple cut Q1 guidance. Mostly affecting tech stocks, but other stocks as well.
379 2019-01-02 21:51:09 I'm hoping this brings some more volatility....I've got stocks I want to buy 
380 2019-01-02 21:50:43 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $ARNC, $GE, $COTY, $WYNN, and $COG.
381 2019-01-02 21:50:33 Seems to be split in opinions doesnt it with? no people will not enter and get out of most stocks.others saying people will jump in.

To me those who can just look over charts. Stock topped, btc bottomed. Hopefully the smart jump in ride up then maybe flip go back in stocks

384 2019-01-02 21:50:00 Evidently Kass does, cause he's super long stocks with no shorts OUCH
385 2019-01-02 21:49:36 'tis a pretty obv apples and oranges comparison

eg "the [French, Italian] budget deficit is small by comparison with its debt, so why the EU Rules?"

386 2019-01-02 21:49:21 BREAKING: $AAPL freezes stocks, will resume trading at 4:50pm ET.  #UNBNews
387 2019-01-02 21:49:01 That's the problem when you only decide to look at factors like P/E ratios than what is actually happening. Compare the actual value of the stocks to the other companies and look at the trends.
388 2019-01-02 21:48:58 I thought Harris asked Kavanaugh some very important, relevant question....seems to me that Kavanaugh and Graham came off as the biggest laughing stocks out of the whole joke of a hearing.

395 2019-01-02 21:46:43 Trickledown economics is the biggest scam in American history. Right now the shareholders are running away with our kids future, the stocks are tanking making Americans use the last card they have. Paycheck to paycheck is a way of life for most, while our kids and grandkids pay.
396 2019-01-02 21:46:39 Good if you want to buy cheap stocks, no?
397 2019-01-02 21:45:53 Business Insider: "John Hussman — the outspoken investor and former professor who's been predicting a crash — explains why stocks are still doomed to lose 50%"

Look up "perma-bear" in dictionary, you'll see Hussman's picture. Absurd to take his calls seriously.
398 2019-01-02 21:45:44 Apple about to take a massive hit so they're halting trading because it'll affect the entire market.

399 2019-01-02 21:45:40 It couldn’t possibly be because tech stocks have been tanking for months could it? It just has to be a conspiracy right?
400 2019-01-02 21:45:38 Forecasted these conditions with $AAPL in Q4 of ‘18 & I believe it will only be getting worse with more bad news coming to the light gradually... $AAPL cuts corners left and right and just wait til they get the same data-mining ridicule as other FAANG stocks...

Point of this post is we shall see....IF the de-coupling of $BTC from stocks begins to widen.  Meaning....$BTC/Stocks are correlated...I see them becoming more uncorrelated in 2019.  Not advice
424 2019-01-02 21:37:49 Oh man. Tech stocks are gonna be fun to watch tomorrow. $AAPL

426 2019-01-02 21:36:54 When you put your money into an investment it doesn’t automatically calculate as a loss. Not all investors in the stock market are losing because you can make money when stocks go up or down. There are many other investment vehicles out there other than the stock market
427 2019-01-02 21:36:44 The only reasons my returns aren’t horrible is because I have investments in stocks that my parents started. Charles Schwab’s robot trader thing did all the work.

431 2019-01-02 21:36:11 Forex has the potential to lose a lot of money.. its more risky than stocks
432 2019-01-02 21:35:58 This is why you never buy stocks that are already at a high price. A company is doing well, people have already purchased it, why would you invest your money into something whose stock will inevitably go down due to it's current high price 
433 2019-01-02 21:35:50 “...for pending news” is very unspecific and the use of the word halt in terms of stocks is very vague unless it’s a term used when referring to stocks that are “halted”, and so only someone who knows about stocks would be presumed to understand
434 2019-01-02 21:35:36 Soros & head of Google sold most of their tech stocks too

Its great fun to watch, a dark comedy that unfortunately Americans are financing
437 2019-01-02 21:34:30 @timothysykes I recently just started investing in Penny Stocks. I am invested in DNR. How will I know when to sell? I bought it at $1.72/share. Today it went to $1.98.
438 2019-01-02 21:34:05 Then we will destroy the economy, have stocks go down, keep us unsafe, and raise our taxes.
439 2019-01-02 21:33:44 What made you decide on those 3 stocks?
440 2019-01-02 21:33:37 Yea like i know a guy that does it. And he makes good money. But he legit wakes up at like 5 AM to study stocks and etc and it’s like his full blown job. Like he goes at it 7x a week

446 2019-01-02 21:31:19 Serious question for all who voted for @realDonaldTrump to "Make America Great" again.  As he shuts down government AGAIN, forcing 1000's to go without pay, as the auto industry flounders, as the stocks continue to crash...
447 2019-01-02 21:30:58 Like I said back in November, so much for the booming economy.  Stocks will go down, all expenses will go up and we will not be safe.
448 2019-01-02 21:30:49 A lot of stocks I track closed red today.

As some have stated, a bunch of forgotten about companies had a really green session.

FIT +8.05%
BOX +8.89%
YETI +8.96%
GE +6.34%
COG +5.28%
SNAP +5.08%

A lot of energy spent to rally from down open just to close flat...

450 2019-01-02 21:30:15 Thanks - odd day - stocks end up, bonds up (yield down), gold up, oil up, crypto up.  Looks like sideline cash being applied broadly.  2.65 on the 10yr sort of amazing as we were at 3.25 not that long ago.
451 2019-01-02 21:30:01 MPO boards, for instance, are often made up of local elected officials like mayors. They set priorities. The MPO planners have few actual stocks aside from broad based transportation funding planning requirements. We can get better with firmer fed requirements as you say.

454 2019-01-02 21:29:11 A classic error is to price real estate movements like stocks. Research suggests sales volumes peak 2 years before prices follow suit. It’s also why Real Estate is highly illiquid in a down market.

456 2019-01-02 21:27:40 They claim that optimization over only the top decile of expected returns produces better-performing portfolios. Perhaps small cap stocks are underrepresented in the top decide. Of course, that would be opposite to the SMB factor return.
457 2019-01-02 21:27:19 $AAPL stocks have been halted. Stand by for news.
458 2019-01-02 21:26:29 Stocks too, thank you Mr. Trump I will buy some if your time as president is over

461 2019-01-02 21:25:12 I always tell others not to try and predict market trends because I know how difficult it is.

472 2019-01-02 21:22:54 @FredFaour Happy New Year! Have you looked into investing into "pot stocks" and using apps such as @Stash ? Thanks and love the show
473 2019-01-02 21:22:48 World stocks ex US lower: US +.1%; Europe -.1%. 2019 began the same way 2018 ended - head-snapping volatility. Fear still rules the roost as markets are unsettled by Trump's dysfunction & slowing global growth. No recession in sight. In fact likely 2.5% GDP-growth & 6% eps-growth
474 2019-01-02 21:22:33 What does he call the entire year?

US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.

491 2019-01-02 21:16:50 Just got out of an Uber: Let me tell you how it went:

Driver: Where’s the Dow going? 

Me: I don’t know 

Driver: I used to work at Drexel, we will bottom March 13-15, then the dow will vertically spike 28000, 42000, 63000. Btw stocks are shit trade futures.

Me: Thank you 
492 2019-01-02 21:16:47 If you didn’t sell stocks, and then buy them, and then sell them, and then buy them back, today, you clearly  aren’t worth the tweets you comment with.
493 2019-01-02 21:16:23 Stocks finish the first trading day of the year slightly higher after a rough start this morning and a volatile session.  Investors appear to be buying dips at these low levels after the worst December since 1931.

516 2019-01-02 21:07:28 stocks are reacting somewhat to trade war but i think the more unacknowledged thing is slowing global growth. that metric spooks investors. mention the word slow, contraction, and people run for the exits & wait to get back in.

520 2019-01-02 21:06:13 We had some good buying going on across the board today. December everything was getting sold off. Today when we’d dropped a little there was buying. Good short term signal. #stocks #investing

525 2019-01-02 21:04:51 Dow and S&P turned positive in final minutes of trading on the first trading day of 2019... this is relevant because, according to Robert Sluymer of RBC Capital Markets, the first trading day has predicted the year’s direction 60%  of the time since 1901. #stocks

653 2019-01-02 20:09:30 invest in stocks then turn it around and invest in your own business!
654 2019-01-02 20:08:56 This was presser makes me want to buy gold and sell stocks, this scared the crap out of me.

665 2019-01-02 20:04:17 Yes I am aware ( I think), when I refer myself as an xrp investor; I mean i have invested my money > xrp, not its stocks or shares of the company. But the tokens have a value, and the value of these tokens fluctuates. I believe it will fluctuate higher, and I will sell.

667 2019-01-02 20:03:34 so this isn't a proper bear market?  Wondering out loud - is it because we have so much more invested passively that we are not getting as much variance amongst individual stocks as in past "proper" bear markets?

673 2019-01-02 20:01:15 The only bad advice in the second book (ironically and IMO) is about investing in individual stocks (they say don't, ever. I say you should, carefully, but you don't have to)

My advice: Pay off all your credit cards first. Invest in index funds to start.

675 2019-01-02 20:01:04 As for the stock market. It has been a bull market for far too long. Everyone buying stocks overpriced them. It is simply a correction that has been overdue for quite some time.
676 2019-01-02 20:01:04 Yeah baby!

Lower the damn barrel...and pay more for the stocks too
677 2019-01-02 20:00:57 The biggest advantage individual investors have is that they can maintain assets under management if they sell out of their stocks too early in a bull market. Professionals face career risk. IMO, this leads to excess volatility.
678 2019-01-02 20:00:34 It would be interesting to find out who said stocks are recovered enough.  Who determines enough!  Weren't they fishing with a loophole of doing research?

680 2019-01-02 20:00:06 Please tell me you don’t believe in window dressing in today’s day and age. So, an investor that sees their fund is down 40% but they own all stocks near the 52 week high list will be somehow think it’s ok?  Of course not. Just like I don’t want to be in cash at market lows.
681 2019-01-02 19:59:57 That's a lucky combination combination of stock options. Most places are stock options where the start price needs to be a lower than year end price. Show me one job posting of a senior developer that's over 200k. Stocks don't normally triple your salary at a large company

If the stock buying and manipulation were not divorced, I could see it being a problem. But the phases are separated. Maybe stocks run out?

777 2019-01-02 19:19:24 stocks go fast in this game because of the punishing disadvantage state, 1 bad mistake could make someone lose a stock, the more neutral exchanges that happen, the more the statistics even out, so there needs to be a balance between taking too long and an acceptable sample size

791 2019-01-02 19:15:20 Let me add to your list...

Not respecting the experience, wisdom or recommendations of his military leaders AND trashing a four-star general just. this. week.  

Here's the truth, TL.  What he loves is military *spending*. Nothing like defense stocks when the GOP is in power! 
792 2019-01-02 19:14:38 Power stocks
793 2019-01-02 19:14:19 But apparently that doesn't extend to all, such as saaaaaaay, bump stocks?
794 2019-01-02 19:14:09 I challenge @Rob_D_Niro to tell the world how HIS life has been nagatively impacted since Trump took office. How are those stocks & bonds doing? How are those house housekeepers?

807 2019-01-02 19:09:40 The idea that Zuckerberg's played dumb and clueless for a year or more is insulting. Stocks are tanking. They'll keep plummeting as evidence of complicity comes out, and ALL the social social media platforms will be regulated and controlled. Good.
808 2019-01-02 19:08:42 I wonder if stocks would be headed lower without a ranting moron on tv?
809 2019-01-02 19:08:29 Win?   The government is shut down.  We’re heading for a recession.  Worst year for stocks in a decade.  North Korea and Russia are threatening us.  Our trade allies are no longer allies.  Life expectancy has decreased (it’s science so you don’t understand).  Which part is a win?
810 2019-01-02 19:08:10 Probably from pension funds. Decades ago many Christian groups divested stocks that they saw as contributing to damaging humanity. Alcohol, tobacco, and fire-arms were among those. (They also divested South African stocks during apartheid.) Conservatives complained then, too

816 2019-01-02 19:03:27 Wow Lmfao, Trump "belives" that in december stocks crashed bcoz of a "bug" in the system?! (as he told to CNBC). I mean come on! i guess the very same "bug" crashed cryptomarket in 2018. Next year it'll be called "smartbug" i think

817 2019-01-02 19:03:11 I like both actually.  Picking stocks is a lot harder since you are on your own.  Funds and ETFs are great for people that don't follow the day to day.  Once you choose a good fund, its manager does that for you, for a small fee.  Zacks does the same with their services.
818 2019-01-02 19:03:03 May put some dosh into some Stocks.....and shares  tomoz!! Oh aye!
819 2019-01-02 19:02:52 I think they should teach about stocks in school and how to invest b doing hands on activity.
820 2019-01-02 19:01:46 Yeah, the baseline is probably the problem. Even if we assume that EMH is true, moving toward the ideal CAPM-MPT portfolio involves moving away from U.S. stocks and toward bonds and foreign stocks. Ironically, following EMH would be seen as "market timing" and "predicting."
821 2019-01-02 19:00:34 Fuck, the smart play would have been to buy stocks in paper straw companies
822 2019-01-02 19:00:25 Essentially yes. Or if a country/FI wants to settle up to become liquid to say, buy gold with it, liquidate to their currency, buy other stocks, currencies, commodities, etc. They would then stock up their XRP again.

874 2019-01-02 18:37:29 This bump in stocks won't last because they keep trying to keep the market up as well as a strong USD which is not going to work. Wonder how many times the PPT will have to fail in their attempt to make the market work their way. Until gold is set free stocks are going lower #HFT

895 2019-01-02 18:30:09 I think we're cool here. Stocks usually go up! When they go down it's an irregularity or a glitch, if you will ;)
896 2019-01-02 18:29:01 Also, making fun of anyone outside gamedev for not knowing the difference between id Tech and id Tech 2 is shitty hipsterism. It’s like laughing at a movie fan for not knowing the difference between Todd-AO and Ultra Panavision film stocks.
897 2019-01-02 18:28:44 I predict Amazon buys Target soon. Stocks are fairly low and Bezos is setting on the money.. if the dollar plunged it would be more hurtful to him than if he owned Target and the market fell.. So it would be a smart move I think. (Though I hate bezos)

My impression is you have serious self control and a good system to suppress fomo. If you have any references to the type of trading you are doing would love to read about it
908 2019-01-02 18:22:26 Hate to say it bc he seems like a good guy, but @WishfulTH1NKin is always tweeting about stocks when they are at the high for the move.  I can time my sells buy him!  (He's a good timing mechanism actually to sell by). I like YOUR stuff actually.  Keep up the good work.

925 2019-01-02 18:16:45 Sorry, I don't see it, scaremongering of what exactly? I took it as making a point that "losses" we accept when stocks markets fall can far outstrip the total amount of money we've paid into the EU that one could argue poorly informed people thought was unacceptable.
926 2019-01-02 18:16:41 Damn toad you nailed this. Do stocks still get a jolt when they cross $5 due to more institutions being allowed to buy in or is that a myth?

960 2019-01-02 18:01:16 I am really baffled at the degree of ignorance of Nigerians. Do you know there are people who trade in stocks and amass stupendous wealth. All they do is watch the screens monitoring trade in different countries and buy/sell.
961 2019-01-02 18:01:04 The glitch Trump's talking about is the US PPT still not working well.... Xi is giving advice how they fix stocks in China.
962 2019-01-02 18:01:01 I should be able to say the same thing about bump stocks. Too bad the traitorous NRA professes to fight for our rights out of one side of their mouth, and calls for accessory bans out of the other.
963 2019-01-02 18:01:00 I'm not a fan of any church owning stocks in a company that profits off of gun violence.
964 2019-01-02 18:00:45 Is it just luck that stocks are falling too?
965 2019-01-02 18:00:37 “2018 was the worst year for stocks since 2008.”

The S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq all suffered their largest annual fall since 2008.
966 2019-01-02 18:00:26 Hi Karin, I have your exact same view. I have a 60/40 on my clients portfolio's. 60% money market. Do feel our stocks are trading at a discount currently. We will see an inflow of foreign investment in the coming year and then I will also start shifting clients portfolios.

Then ETFs can wash out taxes via redemption, and bring stocks back with a step-up via creation. No other vehicle can do that. Why isn't the playing field level?

1018 2019-01-02 17:45:08 tip: income investors should look closely at AT&T (NYSE:T), ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM), and Erie Indemnity (NASDAQ:ERIE). Dividend stocks give investors cash flow even in a down market, making them nice stocks to own when volatility strikes.

1020 2019-01-02 17:44:52 You didn’t hear I guess. New year, stocks decide to only go relentlessly up after an algo tank the open. Any 5 pt downside move matched with 10 pt upside move
1021 2019-01-02 17:44:16 And EU-coordinated policy restored the once highly over-fished and depleted cod stocks, allowing us to continue to enjoy fish and chips (depending whether you are in a haddock or cod-dominated part of the country)

1023 2019-01-02 17:44:04 I would suspect these companies that are going to try adding cannabis to their products will invest substantially into the cannabis industry and increase growth in their product base. Those stocks will be worth watching!
1024 2019-01-02 17:44:01 I think he may have helped with the ban of those gun stocks on automatic weapons.  
For sure he has helped rile up the spectators who didn’t think they needed to pay attention to our government.  Maybe they will vote now — so its a good thing by accident.

1032 2019-01-02 17:40:54 Not if you continue to sell out, you gave a inch on bump stocks

1037 2019-01-02 17:39:45 groups a1-z1 & a2-j2 - tip: Software-as-a-service stocks a very good buy. One in particular is Intuit.  worth adding to your buy list.
1038 2019-01-02 17:39:22 The right:

"We hate gun control! #MolonLabe! Shall not be infringed!"

Also the right:

"Of course criminals shouldn't be able to own them."
"Or them damn druggies."
"Or the Black Panthers."
"Or commies."

"Wait, Trump - where do you think you're going with mah bump stocks?
1039 2019-01-02 17:39:12 Is it a viable strategy to do the OPPOSITE of what "Experts", Crypto Twitter, "OGs" & the Mainstream Media is saying?

"Best year for Bitcoin/Stocks ahead" -> Sell EVERYTHING
"Bitcoin is dead, huge crash incoming" -> Buy Buy Buy
1040 2019-01-02 17:39:10 Now that I'm here (in my office), I'm struggling to remember WHY. ;) 

Let's see. I have some graduation paperwork to submit for some students...at least one grade change to make (sigh), stocks to order...
1041 2019-01-02 17:38:56 The cause is the rules.  If the regulatory structure turns the market into a data network without preferences or competitive advantage in which stocks must trade at a single best price and exchanges must share prices and customers, the market devolves into price-setting.
1042 2019-01-02 17:38:48 Software-as-a-service stocks a very good buy. One in particular is Intuit.

1044 2019-01-02 17:37:41 Ok so now they, those who dwell on CNBC, are talking of how stocks would respond, positively, to a China trade deal. Gotta keep the narrative going. I wonder why their perspective on a possible "FAKE deal  announcement" changed in a nanosec...

1047 2019-01-02 17:36:25 A correction from an over exuberant 2017, similar to what happened to internet stocks from ‘99 thru ‘02. AMZN went down 95pctfrom the high back then, but still turned out fine. Bitcoin is a technological experiment that might work or might fail. We should know which in 5-10yrs

1050 2019-01-02 17:35:24 Yes all the corporations took their tax cut money reinvested in their own stocks and to their offshore version of their corporate headquarters and didn't do a damn thing otherwise with it.
1051 2019-01-02 17:35:03 ever look at Halo Labs? Would love to hear your take..I like what I see and have a good position. Never even heard of the exchange they are on before this but hoping for big things in 2019. If America goes fully legal it’s gonna be big for lots of LP’s.  Look out pot stocks 2019!
1052 2019-01-02 17:34:27 Isis is still there.  Stocks are going down.  He lied about the Middle Class tax cut.  NK still has everything they had before the talks.  You’re easily fooled.  And why isn’t Mexico paying for that wall?  
1053 2019-01-02 17:34:09 I'll be posting all tutorials and trailer vids I made on Pixels and Stocks youtube channel. The channel is up now but still has no videos.
1054 2019-01-02 17:33:18 Waaa waaaa, stocks  are still higher than the previous years, they wax and wane you are smart, figure it out
1055 2019-01-02 17:32:49 Both affect both. If stock markets rise, investors move money into the country to buy stocks in that currency to profit. If they fall the opposite. Moving money in or out a nation affects its exchange rate.
1056 2019-01-02 17:32:45 Ummm there are multiple stocks that have not “tumbled” from his work. But regardless $bad is one of the best performing stocks on tsx last few months, very undervalued and under appreciated. Still 7 million shares short so lots of impetus to move them higher $bad.ca $bad.to

The deal needed approval of 7 federal agencies, and got ZERO.

1069 2019-01-02 17:26:56 Stocks: Seeking an intra-month swing peak now to early next wk w today favored. This within an intra-year downtrend to late Jan to early Feb; within a bear market of the 3yr cycle. So, still low for SPX is the best guess. #StockMarket #SPX
1070 2019-01-02 17:26:23 Stocks dropping in environment of lowest intr rates ever. GDP hardly positive outside USA. Maybe 3 % GDP in USA. Is time to sell house, sell wife sell kids and run to the hills???

1074 2019-01-02 17:25:17 Time to break out the Tesla flamethrower and burn those stocks.
1075 2019-01-02 17:24:53 Stocks “could” rally 300% but they won’t. I don’t care what experts who have been wrong for months tell us what “might” happen. Up until September most have said market will be up because for 2 years it foolishly rocketed up. Now they must think as the past is not predictive.
1076 2019-01-02 17:24:45 Are you seeing this! There is argument, LIVE on CNBC, regarding if there really was ANY validity to President Trump's announcement of a supposed China trade deal in the works- OR if it was just FAKE news to prop up stocks!!!
1077 2019-01-02 17:24:36 I hereby predict that if stocks don't go down that they might go up.  Hey - now I'm an expert too!!!
1078 2019-01-02 17:24:05 The biggest mistake I made and is still made by investors is not staying the course. Even now we’re talking ourselves into a bear market and convincing ourselves we need to be out of stocks. Keep buying good stocks on a regular basis. And stop listening to the media.
1079 2019-01-02 17:23:54 Worst stock market since Great Recession

1082 2019-01-02 17:22:41 The rate of home price gains slowed in November. U.S. Stocks lower to begin 2019. U.S. manufacturing activity declined in December from November.

1090 2019-01-02 17:18:53 That loss, and the “sacrifices for gov service” angle, got the attention.

1139 2019-01-02 16:59:52 well yes, it is understable people arguments, no one followed lurppis to cry about tesla everyday, he only does that for his self-benefit because of the stocks and not that he actually cares so why would we.
1140 2019-01-02 16:59:29 Thank you! I'll certainly keep you in mind when my current stocks run low 
1141 2019-01-02 16:59:16 #investing #stocks great combo of @capitalideasr Capital Ideas with Mark Bunting, and @5iRyan  5i Research with Ryan Modesto; a must listen/watch for all investors; 2 great minds better than one haha
1142 2019-01-02 16:58:41 Since my account and buying power is relatively small atm; I avoid trading the higher priced stocks as I’m not able to buy sufficient shares to scale out the way I like to and still stay within my risk parameters.
1143 2019-01-02 16:58:35 In times of recession cash is king, ignore precious metals. Buy stocks while the market is crashed and you have all your money, when it recovers the stocks will go back up and you’ll be doing well.
1144 2019-01-02 16:58:22 Dropping bonds to prop the stocks?

1148 2019-01-02 16:56:23 I agree . Lots of juniors pop on low volume . It’s not a lot of $ statistically speaking but anything will help the small caps penny stocks recently 
1149 2019-01-02 16:56:23 Last two candles are "Bearish Harami".  It means there is an increase in the future.  But prices reached the lowest level of the rising trend line.  If it breaks that point, you must stop-loss in case you have stocks in portfolio.
1150 2019-01-02 16:55:45 if you think Democrats passed #ObamaCare to HELP FOLKS afford medical care you're NOT paying attention: #WeThePeople pay 2 or 3 or 4 times as much for #insurance/+/#HealthCare today vs 2008 but insurance & Hospital stocks are up 2 or 3 or 400% see $HUM: it's Political CORRUPTION
1151 2019-01-02 16:55:13 Super tempted to trade a bunch today... but I don't want to put too much money to work here with stocks wanting to go the opposite direction of data.
1152 2019-01-02 16:55:12 Almost time to rebuy stocks
1153 2019-01-02 16:55:12 Usually small cap stocks with heavy short interest.  Shorts aren't always available, when they do become available FURU's tweet they located some.  These stocks are on Hard to Borrow list.

1161 2019-01-02 16:52:30 Commodity prices down dramatically, including all the metal and mining stocks. Energy prices down. Oil down from $82. to $46. C.P.I. in Nov. 2018 was the weakest in 8 months
1162 2019-01-02 16:52:12 Are you insane?  Trump has ruined our economy and become an international joke.  Worst year for stocks in a decade.  Farmers need welfare.  He's been caught in so many lies.

1164 2019-01-02 16:51:00 If someone can really do it then it isn’t a bad way to go at all. It’s a bit like the people that say they will invest passively and then freak out and bail when stocks fall….which isn’t passive investing.2/2

1172 2019-01-02 16:46:57 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your chronic fatigue
1173 2019-01-02 16:46:56 So invest in it!!  Privately.  I’ll invest in some renewable companies that are not high risk while also keeping my Exxon Mobil stocks.  Don’t force me to “invest” thru taxes.  That’s not the job of the government according to the Constitution.

1190 2019-01-02 16:42:09 I agree that many people are not concerned about the stock markets. Many people don't own stocks or shares.

You wrote: "Trouble is that those that voted Leave despise the stock market or don't care about it."

Hardly the same thing is it.

1193 2019-01-02 16:41:35 Yes, I agree. Also, the "E" in P/E ratios is extremely inflated by cheap credit and financial engineering, so stocks need to drop much more than it may appear.

1195 2019-01-02 16:41:20 $SPY,$QQQ,$DIA,$XLK  And 2019 starts out as it ended with the majors trading like Penny Stocks via "COMPUTERIZED COLLUSION." How original..
1196 2019-01-02 16:41:20 Stocks
The S&P 500 Index declined 0.3%.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index decreased 0.1%.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1%, hitting the lowest in a week with the first retreat in more than a week.
The MSCI Emerging Market Index sank 1.4%, reaching the lowest in two months.
1197 2019-01-02 16:40:45 Looks like a shift into value stocks today. The S&P and Dow are down about 0.25% at this moment, while 20 of my 30 portfolio stocks (all value stocks) are up between 1% and 4.5%. $SPX $INDU
1198 2019-01-02 16:40:28 Dry Bulk stocks look promising. Long $SBLK and $DSX. Almost irrelevant which one you buy, too many options

1200 2019-01-02 16:40:04 Reading through the list of stocks on the 2nd article, I don't see one that was affected past a reaction and correction. The broader point would be that the fed lowering interest rates hit the indices as a whole, rather than the specific companies hit w/ (presumably) pres tweets.

1211 2019-01-02 16:35:05 Most of my watchlist was putting in a strong performance today, but dips in a couple of illiquid stocks, namely #VLE and #AIEA allowed me to take an initial position.

1215 2019-01-02 16:34:05 I agree with you- mostly; however the recent ongoings with some stocks show that coordinated attacks can be done by groups of motivated   High level manipulators & there are some forces beyond normal market fluctuations.

1232 2019-01-02 16:29:53 Savings =/= investment, and short sellers are not to blame.

Investing in speculative assets should be done with speculative capital, not savings required for living expenses.  Stocks fluctuate because they are traded on markets, not because short sellers want them too.
1233 2019-01-02 16:29:53 This is market volatility: headline "Stocks open sharply lower on Wall Street as big tech companies take losses" 

I check the Dow is down 0.25% and NASDAQ is up 0.10%. News editors, control yourselves.
1234 2019-01-02 16:29:33 You mean this is more important than telling Americans to BUY falling stocks.

1240 2019-01-02 16:27:49 With all the hype around pot stocks, it’s justified that people get excited & want to join the ride

1275 2019-01-02 16:16:22 Stocks face a rocky path ahead in 2019. 

Expectations for stocks are waning as the global economy shows signs of slowing and monetary policy continues to tighten. 

With the longevity of the bull market in doubt, many fund managers say they are expecting more volatility ahead.

1306 2019-01-02 16:08:00 For these reasons, it is classically best to buy stocks when the economy is very weak, there is a lot of excess capacity, and interest rates are falling, and to sell stocks when the reverse is the case.  Because these cycles happen relatively frequently (every 5-10 years or so),

1334 2019-01-02 16:00:28 It went UP after his trade wars and erratic behavior, before going down. I never attributed the increase to Trump, either. It's never as monocausal as that.

(Full disclosure: I sold most of my stocks on 29 August 2018, but not because of Trump).
1335 2019-01-02 15:59:59 Ndx is back to being the driver of everything else. As soon as it went up from -2.6% to flat, oil recovered, European stocks up, HK futures up, Bunds from 0.15% to 0.17%. Intermarket analysis with ndx is useless. It goes its own way, it doesn't care of anything.

Over the past 100 years, the only big loss in a pre-presidential year was 1931.

1532 2019-01-02 14:58:26 I could go on and on, there are many more stocks that will deliver big returns. These are strictly my picks for pure % gains.  Stocks like $NXE, $CCO etc. are clearly great picks with less speculative risk, but I am a firm believer they will be outperformed by less known stocks.
1533 2019-01-02 14:58:19 Over priced IMO. Dividend stocks over $20 (and especially over $100 per share) you are asking to hemorrhage value. 

Stick with the lower cost options. They will be more likely to appreciate AND increase dividend yield. But it really depends on what your risk tolerance is.
1534 2019-01-02 14:58:03 Stocks r doing good, no collapse, just huge buying going on

1565 2019-01-02 14:48:17 Sorry for the confusion, Diego. OTC refers to "over the counter" stocks. These are stocks that aren't traded on an exchange, such as the NYSE. We're focused on listed securities right now, and don't currently support the OTC stock ORHOF.

1584 2019-01-02 14:42:21 Stocks could post worst open to year since 1983 - CNBC - That may not be a bad thing - In1983 the Dow was at about 1,000 and by August 1987 the Dow reached 2747.65 and has since gone up almost 10 fold more since: So a down opening is not necessarily a bad tiding - Happy New Year!

1625 2019-01-02 14:29:40 2018 was a record-setting year for stocks but not for the better. The DJIA dropped 5.6%, the S&P 500 ended down 6.2%, and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for US stocks in a decade.. yup historic
1626 2019-01-02 14:29:34 it's a little sad that Powells Fed gets to crush US growth/optimism/housing..with corporate cutbacks and layoffs to come for US workers.....all on his academic cross of "neutrality" and "normalization" theories as real US families will suffer as stocks/jobs/pensions plummet more.

Not what just happened.
1640 2019-01-02 14:23:36 Rule #1 for investing in 2019. CNBC is always right, only follow their advice and predictions about stocks and sectors. You can never lose money this way.
1641 2019-01-02 14:23:07 Yep but there are extra stocks so that's why we're asking 
1642 2019-01-02 14:22:28 @realDonaldTrump just stated what i said 10 min after I had 2 break it to u know nothing Russia Russia Russia Dems. Oh BTW how’s your gas prices? Stocks? Employment?

1644 2019-01-02 14:21:33 Really nice, maybe just add some more realistic stocks to go with the theme to make it look more like space. Just since the text is 3D but everything else is 2D.
1645 2019-01-02 14:20:35 Yes! I ran out but I’m gonna go to the store when I get back to my place. Thank goodness dollar general stocks it or I’d be permanently broke
1646 2019-01-02 14:18:57 i'm a momentum trader of stocks under $10, pretty volatile stuff. is that where your interests are?
1647 2019-01-02 14:18:43 That's why I'm excited about Gen Z. Social media stocks are plunging. One reason is the obvious censorship but the other (IMO) Is the up coming Generation is much less interested in social media. Fingers crossed 
1648 2019-01-02 14:18:08 Fun fact - on December 26th, more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500 finished positive.
1649 2019-01-02 14:17:57 I can't be happier to see there stocks right now.

1656 2019-01-02 14:13:56 Funny how people ignore ‘Worst Year for Stocks’ and go on and on about gas prices.
1657 2019-01-02 14:13:40 US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.

Saved????
1658 2019-01-02 14:13:19 Trump had impact on oil prices.  We now are a net exporter.   As for the stock market.  The corporate tax cut made stocks prices make some sense.  Stocks are simply a proxy for cash flow.  Which went up with the tax cut.   But if I can’t teach you honor.  Econ is beyond you

1662 2019-01-02 14:12:45 Private property does not lead to monopoly, as large companies have decreasing returns to scale at some point due to an inability to price fixed costs (aka overhead) correctly. Thus, small firm effect in stocks.
1663 2019-01-02 14:12:39 Nice premarket action on $PRAN. I think it could carry into the regular trading session given the uptick in volume. #trading #stocks
1664 2019-01-02 14:12:23 U.S. equity futures tumbled and stocks slumped across Europe and Asia after evidence of slowing Chinese growth dashed investor hopes for an upbeat start to 2019. Safe havens including gold, bonds and the yen all rallied.

Disclaimer: I have not any more stocks in this, I lost a lot.
1682 2019-01-02 14:06:47 This is looking very similar to the first trading day of 2016 -- where the Dow closed down 2.4%. Was the worst start to a new year for stocks ever ---- also due to China economic worries.
1683 2019-01-02 14:06:37 New year, same markets.  Worst year for stocks in ten years. Russell index now negative since Donny took over almost two years ago. I’ll help you list the consumer confidence numbers as they spiral this year. Keep up the good work!!

1710 2019-01-02 13:55:25 Key word here is “could”. It “could” also be a very bad year for stocks. Best practice is to follow price instead of predicting less than 48 hrs into the year.

1722 2019-01-02 13:49:00 Sir,When you develop portfolio with % allocation to each stock then while averaging would you prefer to average all stocks as per original % allocation or you would prefer to average only stock which has fallen?
1723 2019-01-02 13:48:46 Currently 0% invested in stocks in either the retirement or active accts.  Sneaky way to outperform the market would be to jump in on the 2nd market open day after a 2% selloff.  Too greedy to do it though. Looking for 2100 S and P but that could change.
1724 2019-01-02 13:48:24 So this is your new horse, huh? Not 1 tweet about the worst December for stocks since the Great Depression and the worst year for stocks in the last 10 years. Cry baby, cry, people are not blind.
1725 2019-01-02 13:47:45 yet you're probably net down considering the economic impact of a government shutdown and oh the concurrent decline in stocks under your tenure - well done!
1726 2019-01-02 13:47:05 But this isn't what Grayling is doing. He's comparing the market cap of multinational corporations with a flow of payments to the EU. He hasn't done anything to take into account the wildly different scales here, nor the fact that he is comparing stocks with flows.

1728 2019-01-02 13:46:31 Stocks value right now is in an over speculated value bubble. In an age where everything is in the digital world it makes sense to move value there as well. Using gold to store value is laughable in the coming century. Would you rather pack a suitcase of gold or a virtual vault

Regular stocks (not futures) start trading at 3 am central time 5.5 hours before market open they drop the price and they buy it short
1731 2019-01-02 13:44:20 only problem with that is that he'd been screaming to get long 3000 Dow points ago before the 1000 point up day. and kass is super long JPM, C, BAC and other bank stocks from the dead peak 3 months ago. and he added all the way down

1758 2019-01-02 13:36:01 One of the many questions House Democrats need to ask is did Trump or his family sell stocks before Trump announced his trade war with China that has crushed the stock market? Also did they sell stocks after spikes in the market when Trump claimed a deal with China was close?!

1761 2019-01-02 13:34:22 Tax loss harvesting was very popular this year because it was the first down year for stocks we've seen in quite some time. Don't expect that capital to start flowing back until later in the month due to wash trading restrictions.
1762 2019-01-02 13:34:06 I am not sure it has to be risk-free. What's a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds get over the years? More than 5%? 401ks outperform 5% over time -- that was the whole point of the Bush plan  .... You can think the safety net is a good thing and that SS returns seem quite poor...

1768 2019-01-02 13:28:35 So this 2019, I'm going to try to trade stocks. I mean, it's so boring just watching those numbers go up and down, and I'm not doing anything.
1769 2019-01-02 13:28:31 I hope there are at least a few surprises with individual stocks in the sector
1770 2019-01-02 13:28:29 from GS- "the 2018 trading range in S&P of 22% matches the median since 1928"

See everyone?  It wasn't that bad, we've just been conditioned to accept that stocks only go up.

1779 2019-01-02 13:26:10 BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.  So much winning
1780 2019-01-02 13:26:00 Man...trading ain't about being right or wrong. It's about managing your positions. I don't think it's all that hard to find a handful of good stocks that will eventually go up and trade positions in them. I get it, I'm broke. One day I won't be though.
1781 2019-01-02 13:23:37 Those are the prices of their stocks, not the performance of their funds.
1782 2019-01-02 13:22:07 Are them stocks in a pack mate?
1783 2019-01-02 13:21:28 - Worst stock market since Great Recession

- 800K fed workers (>200K Vets) with no pay
- Record China trade deficit
- Nearly $1T budget deficit
- Nat’l debt $22T
- Life expectancy dropped
- 40K gun deaths
1784 2019-01-02 13:21:12 Low unemployment will result in lower worker productivity eventually. Right now everyone (businesses and people) are paying off dept, expanding their infrastructure, and recovering cash losses. Stocks are low because a correction was due.

Also, our back-row stocks aren’t so deep that we can afford to lose Deegan or Doris with injury, internationals & retirements looming.
1800 2019-01-02 13:11:49 As far as long setups in individual stocks, it doesn't get much worse than it is right now.

1803 2019-01-02 13:08:50 Yes, plenty of people can claim that. For one, he’s started a trade war that is crushing farmers. He’s fighting with the Fed and fighting cabinet members on a weekly basis, which caused stocks in 2018 to have their worst year since the Great Recession. Constantly lying . More..

1885 2019-01-02 12:23:24 @vkinkaid11 Hi Victoria. All our Easter range is available in major retailers after New Year's Day, until stocks last. As some stores know that people can’t wait to get their hands on them, they may decide to stock our Easter products on shelves before the New Year. 
1886 2019-01-02 12:23:22 there u go, lying. I've been on real money pro for over 10 years, followed him on twitter for many many years. Kass has said to short the S&P essentially every week since late 2009. And he covered two months ago right at the top and got super long bank stocks.  Prove me wrong
1887 2019-01-02 12:23:12 Dude the US Stockmarket is down 20% in 2 months and worsening. Tech stocks are grossly overvalued. Global markets are coming off a decade long boom and will likely enter a several year correction or more likely recession....and you’re trying to scare us with 10%
1888 2019-01-02 12:22:53 Global stocks tumble as investors worry about China's economy
1889 2019-01-02 12:22:49 Probably this has to do with tsla being one of the most shorted stocks in the mkt. As investors reduce portfolio risk, they sell long positions in “old auto” stocks and buy tsla to cover their shorts in elon’s firm.
1890 2019-01-02 12:20:21 Ever since Trump started pulling unpredictable cards a few months ago I pulled all of my money out of investment, stocks in general have been super bad this year

1893 2019-01-02 12:19:00 There is no bull ore bear market. There are just the financial elite that manipulate all financial markets like real estate stocks and now crypto. They decide when the market will go up ore down. If you don't realize this you are either retarded ore ignorant.

1900 2019-01-02 12:14:03 Thank you.  Most 401ks invest in funds that follow the markets.   The only people up are those who invested in specific stocks and got very lucky.  Otherwise they’re full of shit.
1901 2019-01-02 12:12:52 If the FTSE is falling its because shares are being sold at under market value. Stocks will always be sold whether market conditions are good or bad (otherwise there would be no movement in the price), but if they're going down it's rarely a good thing.
1902 2019-01-02 12:12:51 Also its a question of how much of a fund in invested in UK stocks not how much of UK stocks held by pensions. If my fund loses 20% the sum in overall context is tiny but I am still fucked

1905 2019-01-02 12:11:57 I like when stocks fall. It’s like a tax on the rich.
1906 2019-01-02 12:09:45 It is not either or. It is all of the above. There is no doubt though that the Fed was the biggest concern sending stocks sharply lower & it will be a Fed pause that will help propel the move to new highs.

1921 2019-01-02 11:57:46 How about @DougKass this morning. He's asking how someone could be on TV are being wrong in 2008 and 2018.  Kass has been dead wrong since late 2009 by screaming to short the S&P essentially every week since then. And covered two months and got long bank stocks. and he's on TV
1922 2019-01-02 11:57:28 If you can take credit for gas prices dropping then you can take credit for stocks tanking and the government shutdown too!

1924 2019-01-02 11:55:33 Thank you Immie. Agree w your current strategy of holding on longer. The volatility seems to affect different stocks at different times so it can be a double whammy when switching holdings. However, re-balancing can be effective when markets have settled. Thank you for the video!

1964 2019-01-02 11:17:20 @BeckyQuick @CNBC I believe the data coming out of China this morning, and the stock market decline over the past few months is going to force China and the US to make a trade deal which will be positive for stocks!

1977 2019-01-02 11:10:23 I'm not so worried about stocks so long as other indicators are good.  Its about productivity!  I do want to see wages go up sharply this year to make a dent in inflation.

1994 2019-01-02 10:58:07 Dow Jones indicated open down 400 points.

1995 2019-01-02 10:56:18 Hong Kong stocks just suffered their worst 1st day of trading since 1995.....some say that Xi's speech on Taiwan (which was more hawkish than expected - even expressively mentioning the potential of military force to "re-unite" the 2 nations) contributed heavily to the sell off

1. Read some news
2. Create a watchlist of 5 stocks only
3. Decide the strategy you'll use with risk and reward
4. Draw S/R levels as strategy may fail if it gives
buy near resistance or vice versa
5. Punch orders

2116 2019-01-02 09:29:10 I do believe that he may actually be a buyside analyst that is trying to justify his portfolio of NewCo Proforma stocks that blew up in 2018.
2117 2019-01-02 09:25:08 We can’t have it both ways, as we export to other countries. I have no issues with subsidising supplies when our stocks are low or out of season, but when our biggest competitor in our markets is imported produce, I get frustrated.

2119 2019-01-02 09:24:14 Wall Street ends worst year since 2008 financial crisis

by James Langford
 | Updated Dec 31, 2018, 04:05 PM
Wall Street's moderate gains in New Year's Eve trading were nowhere near enough to avert the worst year for American stocks since the financial crisis.
2120 2019-01-02 09:21:56 Mid day Update (2 Jan):- Benchmark indices hit fresh intraday low. Sensex down 464 and Nifty down 152 points at 10,758. Metal and mining stocks dropped. Negative global stocks weighed on the domestic bourses.
The breadth, 826 rose and 1607 shares fell. 150 shares unchanged.
2121 2019-01-02 09:21:01 Not the best start to 2019 for world markets (unless you're extremely bearish): 
- European stocks -1.5%
- U.S. futures -2%
- Oil -1.5%
- 10y Bund yield below 18 bps
- 10y U.S. yield falls to 2.66%
- Dollar/yen below 109.00
- Chinese & Spanish PMIs slide

Happy New Year!
2122 2019-01-02 09:20:47 @TheMotleyFoolUK can you tell me why I should forget about Bitcoin and buy-to-let and invest in stocks instead? If I don't read an article of yours every 2 days I tend to forget, thanks

2125 2019-01-02 09:18:03 Or not stabilizing so much... Good morning 2019, happy to have you here with China PMI below 50 and Asian stocks sliding, dragging the rest with you.

I think risk of self fulfilling prophecy is pretty high. Low PMIs, lower shares, lower mood, lower expansion due to uncertainty.
2126 2019-01-02 09:18:01 lots of cheap UK stocks around but it's knowing which are the best ones to buy now. My watchlist is growing fast! Obviously there are lots of macro moving parts that need to be resolved (not mentioning the B word) - markets hates uncertainty.
2127 2019-01-02 09:16:51 No, just the slump in stocks you've caused.

2129 2019-01-02 09:13:50 Shorters make money when stocks fall. I think if there is fishy stuff going on, like false studies or white collar crimes behind companies that profit from climate change, it could potentially be exposed by said shorters and squash bills like the this.

2180 2019-01-02 08:43:20 To be fair, the Left care deeply for the stock market these days. You've got a lot of BIG money stocks on there like Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter. And their Lefty CEOs would  bricks if the markets crashed.
Hillary is also heavily invested in Wall Street.
2181 2019-01-02 08:39:47 Fails to surprise me, really. A fair few of the largest companies are reporting falling stocks, from what I understand. Heads tend to roll in management when it comes to that.

However this'll play out, I hope it'll eventually lead to good games. :P

2196 2019-01-02 08:28:31 There's this thing called investment if you want to benefit from your own labor take on the risk and put your money in your companies stocks.
2197 2019-01-02 08:28:09 Bad start of the year for #stocks. Stoxx Europe 600 -1.7%. S&P futures -1.9%. This comes after Chinese manufacturing PMI falls into contraction territory.
2198 2019-01-02 08:27:23 when the balance over the last three months falls below HKD5,000.  If you want to access unit trust, stocks listed in Hong Kong Market and IPO, you can request to open an investment account which is incorporated in the Personal Integrated Account when you open the 2/4 ^RS
2199 2019-01-02 08:26:57 I believe historians have largely rehabilitated Chamberlain as someone who saw Hitler was a madman who couldn't be reasoned with early on but saw the need to stall him for a year or two so the neglected navy and air force could replenish their stocks.

2207 2019-01-02 08:20:35 Work's been utterly #bonkers since Xmas. My stocks better go UP. 
2208 2019-01-02 08:19:50 With weekly sell signals the way I see it, the best short term trades are to let the retrace rallies get going & short them. You won't get rich doing it but its what's going on now. The Precious metals stocks show the most promise of trending. They can trade contra to the indexes

2244 2019-01-02 07:43:03 Le problème c’est que la répercussion est décalée en fonction des stocks. Si la distribution actuelle se fait sur des stocks réalisés à 85$ alors les prix ne bougent pas ou peu. Mais forcement ça doit baisser prochainement.
2245 2019-01-02 07:42:29 Baby investorinos: This year, stocks closed out negative. That means that your stock mutual funds in your retirement accounts will also be negative. This doesn't mean your investments are broken, it means that they are working!!

2248 2019-01-02 07:40:55 They only have the same little guys in Perth that we get over here. The big bastards are up in Queensland. And the most dangerous ones are the Sydney Funnelwebs and the Australian Redbacks. Dangerous if bites are untreated, good stocks of antivenom for both, I believe.

2254 2019-01-02 07:29:54 Chuka, I have an idea on your post-politics career! Accept Brexit, go short on German stocks. Opportunity of a lifetime!
2255 2019-01-02 07:29:42 I think u cannot handle stocks like what Obama did. Just look at the stocks in 2018! It collapsed once Obama residual effect is gone.
2256 2019-01-02 07:28:35 Even one small investor like me can "manipulate" the stock market. About 18 yrs ago, I started to buy and sell stocks online. One day, I sold off all shares of a stock that I was holding, and I realized that this stock prices downed dramatically in a hour after this transaction.
2257 2019-01-02 07:28:06 How about stock ? Is it going to go down like last year? Maybe you cannot handle stocks as good as Obama did ??
2258 2019-01-02 07:25:41 Checking the stocks brings me back to reality lol
2259 2019-01-02 07:24:36 2/military to own an assault rifle. You don’t hunt with them. Their intent is to kill another human being. 
Bump stocks, assault weapons need to be banned - 18 may technically be an adult however 99.9% of 18y/o are still very immature & irresponsible.
2260 2019-01-02 07:22:56 I assume it comes from the fact you can probably correlate a strong USD to a strong stock market? But many instances where gold and stocks move with positive correlation. Even instances of USD and gold being positively correlated

2265 2019-01-02 07:15:31 Actually, I do not invest, but it might be like buying stocks, the value of it might increase later, if you hold on to it, or you might want to sell it, before it goes down, when it is at around the highest point.:)

2267 2019-01-02 07:14:08 This situation has nothing to do with Trump. How's the stock market doing? Now that might have something to do with investors having no faith in Trump's trade and tariffs policies. You'll remember when stocks were up, Trump took credit. Now they're down, he's silent. Why?

2296 2019-01-02 06:44:52 Good morning and happy new year. However it is a far from happy new year for stocks as Asian stocks get open lower as risk-off sentiment dominates this morning on fist trading day of 2019 ... Dollar and oil are sharply lower as China PMI drops below 50 for 1st time in 19 months
2297 2019-01-02 06:44:17 You'd think these guys would know stocks are RED in China when they go up, and green when they go down...
2298 2019-01-02 06:41:58 Stocks like $LII and $FAST never seem to go down. Amazing relative strength.

2302 2019-01-02 06:36:44 For the first time in decades, every major type of investment has fared poorly. Stocks around the world are getting pummeled, while commodities and bonds are tumbling all of which have left investors with few places to put their money.
2303 2019-01-02 06:34:25 I got quite the shock when my iPad updated.  It installed an app called Stocks which shocked me that all the major markets, the FTSE, the Dow Jones, etc have gone up,massively in the last 10 years.  Some people did very nicely out of the “recession” #r4today
2304 2019-01-02 06:34:19 Thanks. I'd agree that penny stocks are a risk. What software do you use to filter stocks and do you have any preferred entry methods (eg on a moving average cross over or when a stock hits a 20 day high?) Thanks
2305 2019-01-02 06:33:20 I think most of us feel the same, but my sense is it’ll be a despiriting choppy affair that will leave some busted, others wanting to turn their backs on $SPX $NDX stocks by the time the bottom is reached. I may be proven wrong so we’ll see. But that’s what I’m bracing for.
2306 2019-01-02 06:32:37 To all y’all irrelevant ass hoes with two stocks, items, 3min timer or god forbid walkoffs. Please go to therapy instead of laying down your issues to others. Thank you

Treasuries didn’t trade in Asia because of a holiday in Japan for most of this week.
2317 2019-01-02 06:24:18 Stocks in Asia fell with U.S. futures and oil erased gains as evidence of slowing Chinese growth weighed on investors starting 2019 concerned about the world economy and reeling from the worst year for global equities since the financial crisis.

2374 2019-01-02 05:39:46 So disappointed with Globe. I called to renew my plan which will expire on Jan.11. I asked for a phone, which is "in stock" per Globe's website. However, I was advised that the stocks are for new applications only. @enjoyGLOBE @talk2GLOBE 
2375 2019-01-02 05:37:57 Would like to see a list of top 10(by market capitalization?)  dual-listed stocks vs JSE-only listed stocks . Thinking about what happened to share price of OM in Zim

2377 2019-01-02 05:37:16 Pellet prices at 5600 per tonne..Stocks down at cheap valuations based on downtrend of pellet prices..Have an eye on pellet exporters
2378 2019-01-02 05:36:44 Weekly close <5600 on #ASX200 was all I was hoping for this week. Now <5500 becomes more realistic. It'll make-up for the low vol counter-trend rally last week. What a joke of a move that was. The market manipulators must think we're stupid.. #ASX #ausbiz #Bearish #Global #Stocks
2379 2019-01-02 05:36:21 Some investing advice for 2019:
- Buy high dividend paying quality stocks (think CML and PGR)
- If you are able, take some cash out of SA. 
-Don’t invest money you cannot afford to lose. Rather pay off debt then.
-It’s not timing the market but time in the market.
2380 2019-01-02 05:36:13 178 shares at $13 or 233 #shares at $9?

Well when the #market drops. I buy #stocks on #sale, and whenever it goes back up, well now I have more shares at a higher price. 

That's lazy #investing.

2385 2019-01-02 05:31:41 @fishingforleave Your rhetoric is all political and historical, a haze of rubbish. There is little about fish stocks, management and other factors relating to fish biology.

2394 2019-01-02 05:25:58 Another thing! The Holocaust so prominent in your country is of much less importance in India and not taught to school children. We are bothered about the  3 million killed by Brits burnt all stocks of rice in Bengal in WWII 1943 & Churchill diverting food ships causing famine.
2395 2019-01-02 05:25:56 If you’re gonna take credit for the low gas prices you have to also take credit for when it goes back up. Just like you took credit for the stock market that trended upward.  Where are you now that the stocks are tanking?

2409 2019-01-02 05:14:23 that said, I'm also expecting the in-progress global recession to be mild and not like 2008 (mostly caused by declining profits) and I'm seeing more interest in cryptos at these price levels then I am in the traditional stock market (aside from a handful of pot stocks...)
2410 2019-01-02 05:14:12 Seriously?  Where is the stocks today?  Where is your 401K?
2411 2019-01-02 05:11:26 Tbh ever since the patch i haven't had to play a single FFA, and only ran into 2-stocks twice
2412 2019-01-02 05:10:41 In the wake of 9/11 it became clear vast sums of money were made in the stock market thanks to 'short-selling' stocks hurt by the attacks. This proved prior knowledge of the attacks. 

The SEC / FBI investigation into this was never heard from again. It just went away.
2413 2019-01-02 05:10:16 I dont know why street is trying to play #FarmLoanWaiver  by buying in #FMCG or #Auto stocks.. Anticipating farmers to spend that money on such purchases but if i understand, #Farmers have already spent that money n are in cash crunch which is why they are not able to pay back!
2414 2019-01-02 05:09:19 You have that feeling. We have no results. You may very well be right. We don't know
2415 2019-01-02 05:08:36 So, more surveillence laws by your old mate Dutton on Australian citizens. Buy cyber security stocks I guess. We get it 
2416 2019-01-02 05:08:34 It’s a fantastic time to buy stocks at a big discount!
2417 2019-01-02 05:08:27 Are we still taking stocks for pausing?
2418 2019-01-02 05:07:52 So eventually all stocks would come under this ? Even the big nifty guys ?
2419 2019-01-02 05:07:48 Some stocks never match with my psychology n create panic in me every time... One is Reliance n
Others

LUPIN N Sun Pharma.

It's better to exit from position if u not feel comfortable.

2421 2019-01-02 05:06:07 Is it because there are 8 stocks on
2422 2019-01-02 05:05:53 US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
2423 2019-01-02 05:03:27 This isn’t hard. Rigorous background checks, licensing and registration at least on par with driving. No need to sell bump stocks, high volume magazines etc, high powered semi autos designed for military.

2427 2019-01-02 05:00:49 I honestly know nothing about stocks either... Just that they go in waves, and to look out for cheap but promising tech ones. So once i hit 45, I'm gonna hire a financial advisor to re-org what we have. Lol 
2428 2019-01-02 04:57:44 SIR,  At this critical point I wish to counsel you Mr. President to provide 2 things to DPRK .

2. COMBINE TECH EXPERTISE USA AND SO KOREAN TO WORK IN DPRK TO TRANSFORM HAZ NUKE MATERIALS INTO SAFE STORAGE AND CONVERT INTO REUSABLE STOCKS. SIR
2429 2019-01-02 04:57:23 Of course u want to take credit.  How bout stocks ending the year at lowest prices since 2008? Want to take credit 4 that too?
2430 2019-01-02 04:56:33 Honestly i actually agree with AOC forcing representatives selling their stocks. if that happened Pelosi would have lost 300 million plus in the past ten years.

2435 2019-01-02 04:52:29 everyone thought last year was the worst year for stocks. With 2019 getting started, @realDonaldTrump , stocks will probably get worse, because his big tariffs put into play all last year are going to start hitting this year. It's going to be a bumpy year.

2437 2019-01-02 04:51:41 I’ve tried my hand at stocks and ETFs. I can’t stomach the risk of single company stocks. If funds can simply average what they’ve done in the past, they can take you where you’re going in 10 years

2448 2019-01-02 04:40:00 If one has an interest rate below 6.5% and a 30 year then they should not pay off the mortgage first.  Invest the money in stocks because they over 30 years they should see over a 6.5% return on their investment.

2457 2019-01-02 04:30:19 That’s what we’ve been lead to believe, but the stocks bounced back a year before the depression started. Woodrow Wilson Progressives polices of adding $20 billion to the dept( borrowing from the newly formed Federal Reserve), raising tariffs, is what lead to the depression.
2458 2019-01-02 04:30:16 There’s nothing wrong with earning, having money and creating wealth for yourself. I’d like to invest in stocks and don’t believe every banker or Wall Street is the sole threat to society.

2467 2019-01-02 04:26:06 Okay but this is a counterpick that literally counterpicks for inconsistency. Anyone who wants to win with their skill as the primary factor should always ban this stage. It never favors the better player because it rewards early deaths and miniscule stocks
2468 2019-01-02 04:23:22 VT had very lenient gun laws. Repub Gov did this (raised purchase age to 21) in April 2018 along with ban on bump stocks & large capacity mags also cant transfer / sell a gun w/out lic dealer who has to do background check
2469 2019-01-02 04:23:09 your opinion is fine, for an unfounded unreasonable opinion.

2491 2019-01-02 04:08:00 A couple of notes after reviewing my last years performance. 

1. Despite the mid-year health issue and slump, managed to close the year with 27.33% gain. Super tough year. 

2. Going to focus more on stocks (common mostly & some options). Reduce futures/forex trading.

2494 2019-01-02 04:07:40 The stock market was on a steady climb and would have reached that number anyway. His tax plan boosted stocks for a short term but why would folks invest when they can forgoe capital gains tax thx to the tax plan.
2495 2019-01-02 04:07:18 What? - fail to see connection - incremental food production relative to fish stocks in the Fraser - why not do a "REAL" report on how the first nations are over fishing this river with the help of our Federal Government.

2497 2019-01-02 04:05:33 @_anujsinghal The Dec Auto numbers are misleading because they are all wholesale nos. All the companies billed limited nos. to their dealers who already had huge stocks. But the "retail"  numbers are much better and dealers have destocked in a big way.

2500 2019-01-02 04:02:45 Do you think it’s just luck that 2018 was the worst for stocks in 10 years (and that last December was the worst December since 1931)? Nope. It’s because of your greed, immorality, and stupidity! #TrumpResign
2501 2019-01-02 04:01:57 stocks? I think you have digital assets and stocks mixed up. 2 different things.
2502 2019-01-02 03:59:39 Not an attractive stock, there are better stocks
2503 2019-01-02 03:58:46 Its basically a counterpick that returns us to the janky inconsistency that was central in smash 4, where honestly if you're the less skilled player, you should select this stage cause you have the larger opportunity to net from stocks ending at 50 instead of 100.
2504 2019-01-02 03:58:05 The main reason is that the argument that its symetrical in its disadvantages is untrue. It strongly favors high base knockback and stocks are as losable as early as 25% with uncharged tipper mid stage. What this fosters is inconsistency.
2505 2019-01-02 03:58:02 What about the stocks? Is that luck? I’m just trying to gage what you deem luck vs skill.
2506 2019-01-02 03:58:00 21,561.448 Is a 20% decline from highs (26951) what some want to call a Bear Market. Bears don’t have a strong economy, or wage increases, and have a Recession tagging along. I showed you what Hedge Funds are doing, buying stocks. I told you what a Bear Market is and isn’t. Good?

2513 2019-01-02 03:54:46 The mining stocks could potentially delink from the underlying metals prices temporarily in a market downdraft, but would be an opportunity if that occurred. $GLD is the lowest risk prec metal play w/o leverage (oper & financial) assoc w/mining stocks.

2521 2019-01-02 03:47:20 If they owned stock and sold it on the down turn instead of holding on to the stocks for long term, then, yes they lost a lot.
2522 2019-01-02 03:47:03 Companies go out of business even in economic booms, what banks are tanking (stocks going down do not have much impact on the individual bank’s revenue or deposits), and I’ve never heard of a mortgage bubble. If you mean housing bubble then yes that is one economic cycle.
2523 2019-01-02 03:44:35 Shouldn’t conservatives be busy turning in their bump stocks?

#gungrabberinchief
2524 2019-01-02 03:44:05 Why the stock market has declined is because of higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs, which tends to slow down purchasing activity, which can in turn cause stocks to dive. This is in consequence to the Federal Reserve Bank having increased rates lately.
2525 2019-01-02 03:44:05 I guess Jerry doesn’t own stocks

2569 2019-01-02 03:22:59 @Magpul_HQ have you considered making a limited production run of stocks for the M1 Garand? It’s the greatest battle instrument ever devised and helped save the world from Hitler’s Third Reicht and The Empire of Japan. It shouldn’t be forgotten.
2570 2019-01-02 03:22:38 Time for a shaming.  Makes me wonder why we got rid of putting people in the stocks so they were shamed and it was public and painful. This dude deserves it...
2571 2019-01-02 03:21:49 Bump stocks suck anyway. The alternatives would have actually banned guns, magazines and ammo....
2572 2019-01-02 03:21:37 In stocks you have principal of cut your loss making stock... Why not in Bank... Wrt Credit... Why water the weed... There are hardly hand full of instances where debt restructuring have been successful... It had only led to more debt...
2573 2019-01-02 03:21:27 if #Biopick2018 taught me anything (and twitter in general), is these biotwitter bandwagon stocks more often than not end up as losers, and the fanboys are just too stubborn to admit defeat. also, picks proves that as several picked same 2019 as 2018
2574 2019-01-02 03:21:16 In the 1920’s there were fixed trusts that bought stocks and only sold if they stopped paying dividends...well, in the Great Depression, first, stocks went down, then stopped paying divs, then the trusts sold and made the prices go down even more. Sounds familiar....

2578 2019-01-02 03:16:37 What happened to the fiscal conservatives? Trump should help pay for the wall. He's rich & benefits w/ his tax cut for the top 1% & Corporations who haven't repatriated their $ & used tax savings for stock buybacks (only 50% of Americans own stocks, btw).
2579 2019-01-02 03:16:22 If you dig the economy into ground, everything will be cheap. Conveniently switched from talking about stock indices to gas prices. S&P500 returned -6% in 2018, the worst performance in 10 years. Each of Obama eight years stocks outperformed. Shameful!!!
2580 2019-01-02 03:16:03 #Stocks,#Indexes Specifically what is compared are those aspects of signal topography known to correlate with subsequent rally duration.  By this metric, the current bottom signals are very similar to those of Dec. 26, after which the market rallied 4 days.

2588 2019-01-02 03:11:10 Mmmm, ABC News just reported that 2018 was the worst year in the past ten years for America's Stock Market.  Gosh, just when things were going so well. 
But let's not rush to post blame, after all, who could possibly influence the trading of stocks?

2654 2019-01-02 02:32:15 What was the news at 7:40ish CST that gave treasuries such a bid and pushed global stocks lower?
2655 2019-01-02 02:31:59 @realDonaldTrump Dow fell 5.6% & S&P 500 was down 6.4% & Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 & only the second year the Dow & S&P 500 fell in the past decade. (S&P 500 and Dow were down slightly in 2015, but the Nasdaq was higher that year.) Trump effect!!
2656 2019-01-02 02:31:15 What so sad is your delusion that Trump has “saved” this country. 2018 was the worst year for stocks in 10 years. Lies constantly. Blames others for his mistakes. Disrespects the military. If this makes America great, I’d rather be lousy.

2662 2019-01-02 02:26:24 Please don't take this the wrong way as I do not mean to sound rude, but if someone is this close to retirement then they should not have that much of their portfolio invested in stocks anyway. Folks don't seem to pay enough attention to their allocations until it's too late.
2663 2019-01-02 02:25:37 My biggest weakness towards end of 2018 was trading in the “grey zone” by jumping in stocks randomly to try making quick money and not being definite with a clear idea of trend/game plan.

2019 my goal is to wait for moments when I’m clear & definite with conviction. No grey area
2664 2019-01-02 02:24:57 Stocks are a gamble. If a paper loss scares you, then invest elsewhere next time it goes up.
2665 2019-01-02 02:23:40 let's take a look:  @ColMorrisDavis

2670 2019-01-02 02:19:05 YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, but as always want credit.

When prices were high you didn't take responsibility, and when they go up (which they will) you'll cast blame.  Same with stocks, you want all the credit for a bull mkt, but blame everyone but yourself when it's a bear.

2680 2019-01-02 02:12:02 Do you think it’s just a coincidence that stocks are plummeting and at an all time low while you’re president? Obama dropped gas prices and unlike you actually helped stocks and didn’t ruin them

2684 2019-01-02 02:09:11 If trade tensions resolve this year, US stocks surge in tandem with oil prices, there could be a short-term spike in 10-year Treasury yields that would be very painful. Not only would this eventually stymie any stock rally, but it could hasten the end of the credit cycle

2692 2019-01-02 02:05:32 Because I don’t see how growth takes off in developed markets with aging populations, record debt piles, protectionist policies, etc. Hard to see inflation surging. If anything growth will slow, giving investors reason to park cash in safe bonds rather than stocks

2705 2019-01-02 01:57:22 Let's see, a portfolio is invested in the market. The market goes down, therefore the value of the portfolio goes down. Stocks trade lower. Seems like a good time to buy. Tell me where in the hell this portfolio is s'posed to get more $$ to reinvest!?
2706 2019-01-02 01:57:09 KRZ ... stocks ?
2707 2019-01-02 01:56:39 he sets aside the pop figures he wants while he stocks the floor.... then takes them home and adds them to his collection
2708 2019-01-02 01:56:36 You might want to check the diversity of your investments. Most of the market held strong through mid-October. Having it drop significantly before then could indicate an over-dependence on tech and health care stocks.
2709 2019-01-02 01:56:34 Chinese figures are not looking good and already signs of slowing so looking like more downside left in the markets imo. This is probably a bear market bounce either way too much uncertainty and not enough confidence in market to push stocks up
2710 2019-01-02 01:56:06 No livro de Graham, o investidor inteligente, há uma citação de uma técnica desenvolvida por um corretor com este sobrenome que foi vendida como “infalível” para stocks. E como toda técnica infalível era uma farsa.
2711 2019-01-02 01:55:06 So many first home buyers means less renters which means cheaper rents. Housing stocks still rising. Bad news for investors, obviously.
2712 2019-01-02 01:54:37 The markets had a good day on Monday, can they pick up where they left off? Not much has changed in regards to trade deal hopes, so I think it could go either way. As we've seen in the past, it only takes one tweet. #investing #StockMarket #StockMarketNews #stocks #stocktrading
2713 2019-01-02 01:53:56 @MicahMcDonald8  How much would a person with a 10 year horizon need to invest? And is it better to gamble with stocks, or more conservative ETF? Tax's also cut into return on investment.
2714 2019-01-02 01:53:24 Just like stocks?
2715 2019-01-02 01:51:15 you have no way to value crytpo or the numerous exchanges that trade it and allow wash trades and spoofing. the "tapes/charts" are painted by traders all the time! take your sales talent and get people into Stocks. #stockbroker
2716 2019-01-02 01:50:24 Election proof stocks also.......

2720 2019-01-02 01:49:30 $CRON weed stocks on a run up lots of support time to move

2722 2019-01-02 01:48:59 Started 2018 like this: Me $3369 in profit, Mr. Market $3798. Ended Like this: Me $3528, Mr. Market $1650. "Mr. Market" is me keeping track of the $ I put in my accounts, and pretend to buy the S&P 500, including #dividends and ALL transaction fees. #investing #stocks
2723 2019-01-02 01:48:08 Bumb stocks and clips...sounds like a weapons genius
2724 2019-01-02 01:45:56 $C bank stocks coming up
2725 2019-01-02 01:44:00 Trump needed to lose on stocks so he could write off any profit he made this year.
2726 2019-01-02 01:43:38 US needs stocks to rise to maintain deficits, but as we saw in 4q, deficits are now crowding out the US private sector to the point that they are causing stocks to fall.  As stocks fall, US ability to maintain deficits fall while simultaneously causing deficits to rise.
2727 2019-01-02 01:41:53 All our sub $5 stocks going to the moon, whatever your favorite is, it’s going a lot higher in 2019.
2728 2019-01-02 01:40:53 Good news. I need my stocks to go back up too please.
2729 2019-01-02 01:39:51 sounds a lot like stocks
2730 2019-01-02 01:39:48 It was an obvious (and frankly insulting) attack by the shorts who believe that stocks don’t go up forever.
2731 2019-01-02 01:39:34 Be careful not to take credit for things that you didn’t do or we will blame you when prices go back up. You took credit for stocks going up but just blamed others when it fell.
2732 2019-01-02 01:39:03 With this one tweet you've given me more highly useful and timely trading insight than in all of Bill O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks" Especially with regards to future growth winners that still don't have positive earnings. Owe you a dinner. Nolo Bistro at Stonehedge?
2733 2019-01-02 01:38:59 Penny stocks best bet. My father made a 300k on them
2734 2019-01-02 01:37:58 Wall Street: worst year in a decade. Lower gas prices will never make up the huge losses suffered in 2018 by Americans on stocks. All thanks to the bumbling ineptitude of Donny Trump and his fellow Republicans!
2735 2019-01-02 01:37:04 Happy 2019 to You, Jim and your family.  Thanks for all that you helps us with, because of you I now love stocks too!!
2736 2019-01-02 01:36:45 Low Gas prices where? Still over 3 dollars a gallon here, so...No Tax Cut for me. Gas Prices are not falling, I dont own stocks or have a 401K b/c Im disabled, but yeah, awesome...Pfffft!
Your a disgrace. You disgrace that office with your Criminal presence.
#TrumpResign
2737 2019-01-02 01:36:31 Just how stupid are you? 
Gas prices are low in the winter. 
There is a surplus of gas right now. 
Stocks are low, 401Ks are falling.
Food is higher because you won't let Mexicans in to pick the fields. 
Apparently you can lead a Trump to Twitter, but you can’t make him think.
2738 2019-01-02 01:36:12 The oil stocks and funds are way, way down. Gas prices, while great for consumers, don’t help everyone. AND what exactly did you do to lower gas prices?
2739 2019-01-02 01:35:30 Happy 2019!  Remember, annual #IRA and #401k contributions went up to $6000 and $19000 respectively (for under 50). Invest early and let compounding work for you!  Stocks are at a discount right now! Read @JLCollinsNH book and blog!
2740 2019-01-02 01:35:22 i wouldn’t invest in stocks rn tho, a lot of them are going down
2741 2019-01-02 01:34:27 $VTVT?!?!? I knew it, busted!! You trade penny stocks lol
2742 2019-01-02 01:33:20 i started off investing in stocks especially makeup ones and apple , and then i put that money to buying multiple gold and silver coins, and now that the price of gold is going up i’ve made about 600 just off of one coin . so now i’m investing that money into my business
2743 2019-01-02 01:32:19 Bump stocks are worthless it diminishes greatly accuracy of your rifle it just sprays bullets around ...stupid

2746 2019-01-02 01:31:32 Never said less supply & higher coin price be more attractive... saying Institutions rarely , if at all , look at penny stocks/ crypto... if Eco System is in place, why is the price so low.. they will pass... I'm a fan of Tron.. they need to stop suppressing price

2749 2019-01-02 01:28:02 Worst stock market year since Great Recession in 2008
- Worst December for stocks since Great Depression in 1931
- 800K fed workers (including >200K Vets) with no paychecks
- Record trade deficit with China
- Budget deficit nearing $1T a year
- Nat’l debt approaching $22T
2750 2019-01-02 01:27:59 I didn't express it well. I meant that Trump takes credit when things are going well, but won't assume blame when stocks crash or gas prices rise. Thank you for the explanation of how they work in relationship to one another.
2751 2019-01-02 01:27:51 Where is the obvious stock bubble today? I mean, a lot of these tech stocks that have been high flyers aren’t really that expensive, they have real, huge businesses with tens of millions (sometimes billions) of customers, etc... I just don’t buy the “value is out of favor”
2752 2019-01-02 01:27:51 not for oil stocks :/
2753 2019-01-02 01:27:44 His immagration policy, the Muslim bans, The Taflrrifs, banning the bump stocks, the wall, his drug stance, ECT. Like I said, he's been ok here lately so if he keeps up like this throughout this term, he might earn my vote in 2020, but so far I'm for #McAfee2020
2754 2019-01-02 01:27:29 Now she has baggage, of her own making, and she will collect more baggage as she runs. The list is long of presidential candidates who have become laughing stocks after running, on both sides, who emerged with their integrity shattered. Good luck to her.
2755 2019-01-02 01:27:01 barin less logic, Stock ,market will not go on on and on....! It is the merit of the stocks also.

2759 2019-01-02 01:25:29 Aunt:  OMG Obama wanted to take our guns away!!!

2762 2019-01-02 01:23:25 I smell a logical fallacy. Why do you need the perfect solution to recognize the stupidity in the wrong answer? You don't. I don't need to tell you the way to stop all gun violence to prove that banning bump stocks does nothing to prevent deaths.
2763 2019-01-02 01:23:10 The MSM  killing stocks and they blame Trump yet statistics still continue to be record breaking. Left wing politicians cry recession at every corner as if they're praying for it. I agree bills have not lowered but work is booming, people are actually spending,my pay doubled #KAG

2770 2019-01-02 01:20:08 Ownership of circulating currency doesn't make it centralized. You have whales in Fiat, stocks, gold,etc. The centralization comes to play with the authenticity of transactions. Currently Ripple only runs like 4% of all validators on the network.

2780 2019-01-02 01:14:03 It might not seem like it now but this is actually good for your 401K. As long as you have, and continue to, put money into it while it is declining then you are buying stocks "on sale". They will go back up, history tells us they always do. Just trying to keep things positive!
2781 2019-01-02 01:13:41 2018 was the worst year in a decade for US stocks. This was following a massive tax cut for US corporations. The tax cut was funded by a massive increase in US debt. That’s not sustainable. I would be careful bragging here. Will you also take credit for the downturn?

2785 2019-01-02 01:10:25 it's weird how you alternate between nearly believable and oddly obsessed with trolling and stocks that have nothing to do with MiMedx products.  If you have nothing to hide, man up and put your name to it.
2786 2019-01-02 01:09:47 You are right, I should have said Securities instead of Stocks. But the point remains the same.
2787 2019-01-02 01:09:36 The #taxscam didn’t help the bottom 70% of Americans, other than a 6 month period when stocks rose in 2018 making 401K owners feel richer for a while only to drop again. It did, however, sore the debt & deficit, giving the @GOP the excuse they wanted to cut the social safety net.
2788 2019-01-02 01:09:15 It’s been a while since I started thinking about joining the stocks game. My will is there but my wallet’s not so happy about the idea. I gotta say, I’m not getting any younger. Should I start this year?

2800 2019-01-02 01:01:59 It’s disadvantage state. Being able to push a button and forcing your opponent to whiff a move for free discourages follow-ups from the person who actually landed the move that sent you off stage. It’s why we run three stocks, and why this game is so fun to watch and play.
2801 2019-01-02 01:00:39 Federal government is being sued now because of the THIRD Trump shut down and our debt is at an all-time high. make America great again huh stocks at an all time low and our country is divided the worst I have seen in my life.

2804 2019-01-02 00:59:08 There is only one reason someone suggests you buy a stock... to run it up in price so they can sell at a profit... you are left holding the bag... many times it is in penny stocks. Run for the hills when someone says a stock is ready to break out. Turn away and walk.

2824 2019-01-02 00:47:28 Is this legit? I am new to stocks and I have no idea what’s good and what’s not. 
2825 2019-01-02 00:46:40 I suspect drug company stocks will crater in a couple months.
2826 2019-01-02 00:46:33 Hey big guy I need to at least get back to break even on my oil stocks  great job Mr. President, I am willing to take the loss for the greater good

2829 2019-01-02 00:43:30 My New Years resolution is to expand my social network with people who trade or would like to trade in the stock market. If you trade, or anyone you know has or wants to trade stocks, please reach out to me!! I need more likeminded friends 
2830 2019-01-02 00:42:28 Hahahah!  That’s Funny!  How many Cops did you see walking around with AR’s, with added Bumb Stocks, 50 round clip?  I just saw a police presence...  Take your “I have the right to an AR and STFU”
2831 2019-01-02 00:41:05 Bulldozer Of the World Trade Market is back, Computers aren't Obsolete or dead, the Australian Defence forces turned them off. 
I'm ready when the Business Stocks are ready, I'll buy Top-end while you buy at %50 to %60, Stocks will go %200 and let's make some money.
2832 2019-01-02 00:40:50 Do you think it’s just bad luck that stocks looked worse this past year than they have in ten? I mean, I know that stocks have nothing to do with the economy and real ppl, but you sure fucked yourself and your ftriends, dint’ ya?
2833 2019-01-02 00:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2834 2019-01-02 00:38:17 It's not a stock market but rather a market of stocks ...closed 18 up > 25% ..
2835 2019-01-02 00:38:04 Are gas prices your new "stocks are doing great" story?  Is there some Blue Collar wife telling her husband how great the #MoronPresident is because of gas prices?

You had nothing to do with gas prices.  Please go back to telling us how you are responsible for the economy.
2836 2019-01-02 00:38:02 Just got a 36% return on trading  some penny stocks......earned a whole $4 lol
2837 2019-01-02 00:36:46 Do you think it's just luck that this is the worst ear for stocks since 1931?
2838 2019-01-02 00:36:45 But since 'only rich ppl' own stocks who cares. Less inequality, right?
2839 2019-01-02 00:35:02 Trump’s next tweet:

The Government is open, the Wall is built, Mexico paid for it, stocks are at an all time high, we slapped huge sanctions on Putin’s ass & minimum wage is now $35/hr.

AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS WILL BELIEVE IT...even though their paychecks are the same!
2840 2019-01-02 00:34:56 That's a BS excuse.  The airport has a warehouse that stocks all the consumable goods they use. So basically they are saying their warehouse staff is incompetent and doesn't do their job.
2841 2019-01-02 00:34:48 You had nothing to do with the gas prices!  Why didn’t you take credit when stocks plummeted and I lost money?
2842 2019-01-02 00:34:13 What do you call what happened to our 401K’s & STOCKS, & health insurance INCREASES, dipshit donnie?
2843 2019-01-02 00:33:27 Is basically all citizens should have access to. Multiple rounds and bump stocks. No. Armed teachers. No. And national registration and more intensive training like how Japan I think does it. Should be harder to get and purchase everywhere not just a few states.
2844 2019-01-02 00:32:20 Donnie, while Americans may save a few pennies at gas station, they have lost millions in 401k and stocks thanks to you.
2845 2019-01-02 00:31:47 A lot of people are starting to trade them like stocks. They are 100x’s more lucrative if you know what you’re doing. I’m learning it now
2846 2019-01-02 00:30:48 Like what ? The only BS I don't like from him is his ban on bump stocks. But, that's not going to stop me from voting for him.
2847 2019-01-02 00:29:32 Stocks have you worried?
2848 2019-01-02 00:28:48 Let's compare this to stocks. Do you want to buy a company that has peaked or do you want one that's on the rise? I'm a definite homer with Cleveland but you have to admit it's the most attractive talent and cap wise.
2849 2019-01-02 00:28:38 Glutensplaining: most rolled oats are milled in plants where wheat is present, therefore are not "gluten free.". Most stores prolly don't stock "gluten free oats," but apparently her local stocks "gluten free muesli" which is mainly rolled oats from a gluten free facility.
2850 2019-01-02 00:26:43 Bit by bit, they're taking away 2A. 
Age restrictions
Bump stocks
2851 2019-01-02 00:26:22 DO IT NOW we gave notice Let's be gone fresh start and all that!!! Preferably before they rape the hell out of our fish stocks 
2852 2019-01-02 00:25:54 Oil is a commodity, stocks have been falling all year! Duh!
2853 2019-01-02 00:25:35 Do you think it's luck that the stock market is tanking?  tanking stocks are like having a fucking moron leading this country into bankruptcy.
2854 2019-01-02 00:25:30 You have nothing to do with global oil prices. But do tell us all about the high stock prices you were claiming credit for. 2018 was the worst year for stocks since 2008.
2855 2019-01-02 00:25:15 But you can easily lose that money too. There is no guarantee of returns. You can invest it in businesses and lose it all or lose more than you win. You also can put it in stocks and still lose money. The difference ifbyou lose the money, you still owe.

2857 2019-01-02 00:24:57 @MadMoneyOnCNBC  Jim, you spoke about not buying stocks tat are in the blast zone (makes sense). Is $AAPL in the blast zone? #China/#Tariffs? Thanks, Paul
2858 2019-01-02 00:24:47 What you don’t realize is Larry Scott has been sharing stocks of the league for years, because the rest of the country owns the Pac-12
2859 2019-01-02 00:23:39 Check gas prices lately? How about unemployment numbers? What about Black unemployment?  How about paying much lower taxes? If Fed wasn’t so interested in killing economy, would stocks have declined?  Hummmm
2860 2019-01-02 00:23:36 Is Yield the right terminology to describe why people bought FAANG stocks & Bitcoin? That was FOMO & seeking outsized returns but that wasn’t the same trade as chasing lower quality emerging market bonds in a hunt for yield? Anyone pushing Bitcoin as a “yield” investment is mad.
2861 2019-01-02 00:23:35 The truth is that BTC is a risk asset, so are certain stocks suc as tech sector, mj, bio. These are correlated over large periods of time, and respond sharply to monetary policy change
2862 2019-01-02 00:23:03 You just have to have the right approach.  Quality fund managers who want to buy and hold forever often get them wrong.  That is after their research and infrequent new additions.  A hedge fund that has a series of "bets"on new stocks every year is unlikely to succeed IMO.
2863 2019-01-02 00:22:40 $BOT and $PO3 quality stocks!
2864 2019-01-02 00:22:31 My point is technical analysis is worthless. Snake oil. When TA is correct it is dumb luck. It never beats the market over time because it ignores all of what actually drives stocks over time. People believe in all kinds of things....
2865 2019-01-02 00:22:28 They are low because you have tanked the economy. Stocks are down 30% from earlier highs this year.
2866 2019-01-02 00:22:23 Another tax cut for the rich I'm guessing. Meanwhile in reality... wages are stagnant. Corporations did nothing but buyback their own stocks with the extra money and not help the economy. And the cost of living is higher. Wiping out whatever benefit lower gas prices made.
2867 2019-01-02 00:22:03 Not for stocks
2868 2019-01-02 00:21:47 Don’t you think the sp difference would justify it . They are dividend paying stocks after all
2869 2019-01-02 00:21:23 Are they equipped with bump stocks?!
2870 2019-01-02 00:19:07 Mexico isn’t paying for the wall. “Mexico will pay for the wall,I promise you that”. Hahahaha. “Stocks are at an all time high because of me”. Oops again. “I hire only the best people”. Oops again. Shall I keep going ?
2871 2019-01-02 00:16:25 @realDonaldTrump 
BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
#TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown #MuellerKnowsEverything #GetOutofOurHouse
2872 2019-01-02 00:16:10 What's your take on Trump banning bump stocks?
2873 2019-01-02 00:14:30 If they lost 50% (and unless they sold these are paper losses) they were too heavy into stocks unless they are very young and can withstand the ups and downs on the market. I agree, if anyone rolls the dice and loses that kind of money too bad. A CFP would never recommend that.
2874 2019-01-02 00:14:24 Bighit maybe you could go ipo by releasing 1/10 of your stocks and let army buy your stocks 
2875 2019-01-02 00:14:11 Great things! Stocks lost the year’s gains! Looming recession partly because of Trump tariffs! Record deficits! US standing in the world diminished! Putin gets everything he wants! Countless investigations of Trump! @realDonaldTrump
2876 2019-01-02 00:13:49 No, we need businesses to grow, but when CEO s give themselves millions of dollars each year, and huge amounts of stock options, AND the taxscam gave them billions more that they bought more stocks with in their own companies, something is really not fair to the rest of the 99%.
2877 2019-01-02 00:13:41 Worst December for the stock market in 10 years. Stocks were down 6% for 2018 which effectively makes that a tax hike.
2878 2019-01-02 00:12:38 and maybe buying stocks and bonds? worth diversifying at a young age for high yields later
2879 2019-01-02 00:12:16 BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
2880 2019-01-02 00:11:45 yep but I do know you will try to take credit for it Stocks were up u took credit Now stocks sucking wind Donnie hides
2881 2019-01-02 00:11:16 “US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.”  You think a drop in gas prices will even things out DT?
2882 2019-01-02 00:08:09 Why are my stocks tanking????
2883 2019-01-02 00:07:28 Gas prices got as low as $.99 during Obama. So they aren’t as low as they can go. Has nothing to do with you. It has to do with more production in the US. This started with Obama. In fact, Obama’s economic policies has lasted thru 2018. Now with you, stocks have tanked.
2884 2019-01-02 00:07:13 Do you think it's just luck that stocks had the worst December since the Great Depression?
2885 2019-01-02 00:06:53 I know it has nothing to do with you.  Guess what else is falling?  Our stocks.
2886 2019-01-02 00:06:19 Ok no just keep it’s the same fake and normal smash ball only 3 stocks
2887 2019-01-02 00:04:41 Guess they want Trump’s government to have all the bump stocks and weapons. Weird.
2888 2019-01-02 00:04:11 Hilarious to watch CNBC try and explain 1,000+ point gain as if it was   organic buying.
>Day after Christmas: 'Great    Christmas Numbers Send Stocks Soaring'  Fast Numbers Tally Ever!
2889 2019-01-02 00:03:43 No that was stock buybacks for the rich who then sold the stocks for a huge profit but crashing he market. 

It’s basic economics.
2890 2019-01-02 00:03:32 kimchi stocks were flat today.
2891 2019-01-02 00:03:15 First line of the article “U.S. stocks drifted higher Monday but closed out 2018 with their steepest annual declines since the financial crisis, reflecting growing unease among investors about the health of the nearly decade-long bull run”
2892 2019-01-02 00:03:07 Lmao a tax cut for his friends and his cabinet members who was working in administration and still owned  stocks lmao
2893 2019-01-02 00:02:46 The issue is over estimating your ability to forecast the future IMO.  This is why the "top" hedge funds go wrong.  They forecast the future for stocks/markets then invest on that basis.  A better approach is to find good companies/markets and stick with them long-term IMO.
2894 2019-01-02 00:02:41 At all, I laughed when I saw stocks and Forex up there, there is nothing like luck with those two..
2895 2019-01-02 00:01:22 I think we’re in a stocks vs flows discussion here. No argument that ICE rolling stock will be dominant for a LONG time. But in flows, we’re right at the peak. ~94m annual units going down for ICE, ~2m annual units going up for EV.

2897 2019-01-02 00:01:09 2017 was still Obama’s fiscal year until October. Trump’s started in November. He gave a tax break to the rich in Q1 who bought stocks back driving the market higher. They then sold those stocks for a huge profit but dropped he market.
2898 2019-01-02 00:00:18 Stocks down, prices up, recession possible ... let’s see what the American people say. We already know that most voters didn’t want you in 2016, given the historic margin of your popular vote loss.
